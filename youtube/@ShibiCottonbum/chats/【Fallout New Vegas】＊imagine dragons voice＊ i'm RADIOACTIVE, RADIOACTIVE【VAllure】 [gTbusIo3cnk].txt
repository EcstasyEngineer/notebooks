M I L K	3802577	Wild Wasteland is for random funny moments in gameplay
Spaceman	3808176	wild wasteland is a must
Somnus Vivarum	3815853	Shibi. Wild Wasteland.
Lars TheDude	3816873	Wild Wasteland is for fun secrets
flugel	3818152	wild wasteland always
Abcron	3819636	People like Wild Wasteland but it's like a handful of things you probably wouldn't even find
Somnus Vivarum	3819799	YOU MUST. XD
Scream	3830209	It adds Easter eggs 
Necrosis	3832797	it adds jokes and memes from movies
Necrosis	3842748	and easter eggs yeah
flugel	3850955	wild wastelands is basically references
Braden Smith	3854376	it's more likely weird shit happens
DynamiteN1TR0 🧊	3855461	:nerd_face: 
Somnus Vivarum	3862040	We can explain some of the Wild Wasteland events and easter eggs if you run into any
Abcron	3865344	Any of them really
Somnus Vivarum	3865979	and YOU WILL
Devyn lich00	3867145	build to destroy gives you more weapon damage at the cost of faster weapon degradation
Somnus Vivarum	3872796	and it's so good.
Abcron	3872798	Or none
Necrosis	3874253	four eyes and small frame are good
Nano Fate	3874507	Skilled is incredible
OxboyRyan	3876661	Honestly I wouldn't pick any of the rest of them
Devin Mahar	3886780	Put the Glasses on!
Scream	3887450	You don’t have to add any others if you dont want to 
Enygmus	3890432	i usually get 4 eyes cause it's pretty much free
Devyn lich00	3908176	built to destroy is the only other good one

Ms. Black Fire	5448860	there's no bullet drop but there is random bullet deviation
Abcron	5454315	@Exiled M4G3 Actually she meets all the requirements for this gun
Archie gav	5456877	Do you need some yellow paint to show interactables? :_Smug:
Michael Pagel	5457504	Even ironsights are influenced by the gun skill.
Ninjaops	5460118	git gud>
George G.	5467397	the gun is just bad is all
RIghtful Chaos🐰👠	5467409	No, this game just has terrible gun play. It's primarily an RPG with everything else secondary.
X2DOKI🐰👠	5472631	I think it's just low accuracy in the gun
No One Special🐰👠	5473882	yeah it's more rpg then shooter. you need to increase the small arms skill.
Necrosis	5481464	yeah you gotta aim more
FlapjackDr	5485342	the yellow paint exists for a reason:_LOL:
flugel	5486509	see
Somnus Vivarum	5493177	Your hands are shaking, by the way. Crouching makes your aim steady
Archie gav	5497740	your accuracy is bad if your weapon stats are low. I think small arms/perception is what matters for rifles
Somnus Vivarum	5503605	...save.
Ms. Black Fire	5509067	and also unless you install a mod that fixes this you have to aim a little lower than your iron Sights 
Abcron	5511207	This is if you wanna change any stats
Ms. Black Fire	5511412	because for some reason the iron Sights are aiming a little higher than where the bullet actually will go
FlapjackDr	5518903	LMAO 
Necrosis	5520794	if you dont meet the stats your character will have it sway in your hands
Ms. Black Fire	5526829	there's no bullet drop but there is random bullet deviation

Xan dan	5861667	no vehicles at all.
Somnus Vivarum	5864832	Guess what happened to that car
No One Special🐰👠	5867284	Bethesda is just barely figuring out vehicles now.
Necrosis	5878535	Get someone to mod them in for you
Ms. Black Fire	5888004	there is a mod that adds vehicles but I couldn't make it work slash it was not worth it for me personally to make it work
pepemattos22	5888279	quick save then do it

TappedPotential🐰👠	6397199	The Exorcist qualifies as religious horror methinks

Baldr_Golem	18210649	... was that person important?
zeffire	18218676	that's why you have the other arm as a backup
Somnus Vivarum	18220077	Also yeah, you can just use your hands
Abcron	18238693	You have a switchblade
Somnus Vivarum	18243013	Switchblade is viable.

Somnus Vivarum	18290509	The sweet-spot on that one must have been massive
Baldr_Golem	18298345	for some reason it doesn't make the hat look bigger, it makes shibi look bun-sized
zeffire	18305435	imagine in late game carrying a bag with hundreds of thousands of bottle caps, that would be so heavy

Baldr_Golem	18521585	ah, I see it, yeah lol
Grembo	18524563	average Midwest gun cabinet
Somnus Vivarum	18534557	okay. We need to explain the differences between LASER and PLASMA.
Somnus Vivarum	18547443	Laser uses Energy Cells, and turns things to dust.
Somnus Vivarum	18563425	Plasma is slow moving alien shots that MELT PEOPLE.
Grembo	18564020	plasma shoot hard. Lazer shoot fast
Somnus Vivarum	18570935	and use Microfusion Cells
Grembo	18572715	plasma is way better
Somnus Vivarum	18576505	or MF Cells
Something Original	18578090	Laser is pew pew. Plasma is PEW PEW
Abcron	18579928	No some plasma guns also use energy cells like the plasma pistol
zeffire	18584625	laser shoots a fast projectile with less damage, plasma shoots a slow projectile with lots of damage
Somnus Vivarum	18600295	noice!
Grembo	18600398	especially if you get the Q-35 matter modulator. it crits like crazy

Abcron	18698492	@Somnus Vivarum There's basically no chance since she's got the "I wanna do the main quest first" mentality
