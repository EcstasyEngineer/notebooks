Baldr_Golem	20807913	it's good, mostly open maps that give you plenty of wall running and wide angles for titan fights
Kap C Seekum dotGarr	20836082	They are a bit more arena-y compared to TF1, still fun though. They remade Angel City and its just as fun as the original

FlapjackDr	25984277	The PS Spiderman 
ドレイク・グレイザー[Drake Grazer]	25988081	I'll never forgive EA for dropping Titanfall 3 for moar Apex.
Green Enigma	26013304	he's an NPC in fallout New Vegas I think
GamingKitsune99🦑🛐 	26015721	Slone calls you a bad Pilot during the fight while not fighting you most of the time

Ruin Desolation🦑🛐	26033757	titanfall universe (pre-Apex) is sooo cool
FlapjackDr	26040099	considering what happened to tf2 
X2DOKI🐰👠	26042950	EA is allergic to good decisions
Kap C Seekum dotGarr	26046442	Valkyrie is Viper's daughter
Stashpower💔	26050218	Because they want to Run there online Casino
Spaceman	26054490	the sad fact is they probably make more money in one season of low effort apex micro transactions than they would from a tf3 release
Fake	26063482	sorry cant do that, we need 3 more live service slop games aap
DnDRecords Official	26063909	I think the reason why they don't is because they wanna get the most money with the least resources used.
Ruin Desolation🦑🛐	26065637	i dont want the people in respawn right now to make tf3, they smeared the series in apex
AlucardsTrapCard	26074701	respawn are the ones who dont want to make titanlfall 3 apperantlly
Akashua Bloodriver	26086844	Viper has a daughter who's one of the Legends in Apex by the name of Valkyrie, and what she did was copy her fathers' titan design to make her jetpack, which is why it can fire missiles.

Devin Mahar	26109632	How many people from the Titan Fall 2 team are STILL at at Respawn?
ドレイク・グレイザー[Drake Grazer]	26113350	Titanfall 2 was a masterpiece of design and monetization. ALL the paid stuff there was mostly cosmetics and some can still be farmed.
Stashpower💔	26126101	They want people to keep gambling with Loot Boxes and get Money that way
FlapjackDr	26134510	i mean about them ever making Tf3 
JOkr	26134788	lol
That one gray Harelot	26145342	Rainbow’s weird now
Devin Mahar	26147678	Cause I'd rather have a GREAT FallTitan instead of a bad Titanfall 3

GamingKitsune99🦑🛐 	26155276	I dont think the people that made Titanfall 2 still work at Respawn
Monkey	26156991	punch the mic x2
Akashua Bloodriver	26171465	Also ngl, the best mode in TF2 after the campaign is Frontier Defense which as a Legion main myself, is always peak and fun and exciting.
Ruin Desolation🦑🛐	26175648	im perfectly fine with titanfall 2 being the resting point of the series
Ruin Desolation🦑🛐	26190957	it isnt respawn is basically skinwalking with the name of the corpo

Khift🦑🛐	28219827	1070 kun needs a rest
JOkr	28234167	That takes a lot of time and dedication and more importantly you have to play for a different ambition than enjoying the game
brochlan	28250584	a speedrunning game like deepest sword?
FlowerHead🐰👠	28251130	Super Mario 64 the classic Speedrun
Spaceman	28260020	just gotta learn an easy route. lots of streamers did sm64 16 star a while back

Anon Ymous	28576312	maybe you can play dark souls 1 on stream and play elden ring alone? the older games are much more managable for streaming

Gavabond	28605241	Sekiro is not that difficult imo, it was my first one
Rage Plai	28608618	Crabs Treasure
AngelMC7	28615270	thats the souls game
Anon Ymous	28615962	dark souls 1 is the best but some people have an affinity for 2 or 3
FlapjackDr	28624073	sekiros difficulty ranges on if you get it to click or not 
Rage Plai	28624602	ah sorry to hear
Stashpower💔	28646553	Honestly out of All of them I love Armor Core, but it's not a Souls-like game in the Traditional sense

Kap C Seekum dotGarr	29021260	its just a goated game
Doctor P	29051297	the storytelling is implied rather than explicitly spoken in Elden ring
Stashpower💔	29051741	Dude Gmod is such a callback
AngelMC7	29062257	maybe becuz at ragnarok and not early where you get to know more of the characters fron the begining?
X2DOKI🐰👠	29086550	Sometimes you come across that game that just really clicks in terms of lore, gameplay, etc

X2DOKI🐰👠	29349503	I wonder if there are other vtubers that would be down to DM for you
Something Original	29357238	If you play online, you don't need to be good at math. The sites do all the math for you
