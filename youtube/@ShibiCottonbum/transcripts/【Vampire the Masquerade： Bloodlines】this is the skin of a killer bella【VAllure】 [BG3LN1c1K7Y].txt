Are you sure about this?
Hello.
What?
Is something the matter?
What's wrong?
What are you...
Guys, what's the matter? Everybody's freaking out.
Is something on my face?
Weird.
Anyways, how are you guys doing today?
That boob has a head? What?
What are you talking about? I'm looking at my model, I look fine.
I don't know.
Um...
Did you remember to tweet?
Yeah, I should do that.
So no head.
Smash his phone.
Am I okay?
I'm fine.
I'm great.
I'm having a great time.
I'm dressed real cute.
I'm wearing a t-shirt.
And my t-shirt says it's Necko or it's Heckno.
I bet if you google it you can see exactly what t-shirt I'm wearing.
Strony raid.
Ow!
Ow no! Hello!
Wait.
Wait, you guys missed my bit.
So, I was at... Do you guys um...
I have a really important question for you.
You guys want some head?
Cause I got you.
Yeah! Yeah, here it is.
There's the head.
Here's the head you ordered.
Is this not what you wanted?
See, this is my cover up for stream.
What do you mean it's cursed?
Mom!
Mother, you don't love me.
You did this to me.
You bathed me from your loins.
I'm stuck like this.
You need bread when you have head, you know?
Yeah.
Can I add another head?
Actually, can I?
Can I add another head?
Oh!
I have to like get rid of the...
My shadow for my stuff.
We are...
The madams 3.
Would you like to have your way with me?
Are you not entertained?
Do you not want to get brain?
Be not afraid.
Be not afraid.
I wish I had reverb so I could be like
Be not afraid, my child.
Wait, hold on.
Wait, I think I do a reverb.
Uno momento.
Uno momento.
Please hold.
Please hold.
Please hold perfect.
Be not afraid!
Is it working?
Come forth, my child.
I will not harm you.
I care for you so, come into my warm embrace.
Let me bring you into my frail against my bosom.
Give me a kiss.
I will not harm you.
Wait, hold on.
I have another idea.
Please hold.
Hold.

Please hold.
Will this work?
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Please hold.
Please hold.
We interrupt this program to bring you
three-headed sheebie.
Please lock your doors if you see a three-headed sheebie.
Do not look directly at the sheebie.
If she has more, then three heads.
Two is fine.
Wait, hold on.
I'm coming right at you!
My neighbors are walking by.
I thought you were a rabbit, not a hydra.
Hell, hydra!
Can I put it?
Oh, oh, hold on.

Oh, wait.
Please hold.

Oh, wait.
Please hold on a moment.
Fuck.
There's a lot going on right now.
And perfect.
I got my cover up.
All sorted.
Do you guys like it?
No?
Is this distracting?
Why is one bigger than the other?
Breasts are like cousins more than sisters.
Just like your eyebrows.
Just like my eyes.
My eyes.
My eyes are down here.
Okay.
My eyes.
Wait, it just toggles for all of them.
Oh, god.
What are you doing?
I don't know what you're looking at.
It will.
Wait, wait.
Hold on.
Will this work?
Be not afraid.
I can't breathe.
Be not afraid.
Open your heart to me, Aaron.
We will become one.
A hive mind.
Let me into your soul.
Open the door.
Open the door.
Come on.
Oh, let me in.
Let me in.
Let me in.
Please.
I won't hurt you.
I swear.
Please.
Won't you?
I'll be good.
Please.
Please.
Okay, anyways.
Well, what just happened?
I think I blacked out for a moment.
Let me go get a drink.
I didn't grab a drink.
Actually, I have some coffee next to me, but...
Why don't you guys come over and do my dishes?
Like...
Please.
I want to go home.
I have money.
Grab a slice of water.
Oh, my cake.
Is that a cat?
A crazy, really chunky cat?
I lost it for a bit?
I don't know.
I don't know what you guys are talking about.
No?
Do them yourself, girl.
Come on.
Strangle is first born child.
Don't forget to tweet the stream has started.
Oh.
It's time for ADHD.
What a count am I on?
Jesus.
Where am I?
Well, I hope you guys had fun hanging out with Strani.
I hope you had fun hanging out with Strani.
I hope you had fun hanging out with Strani.
I hope you had fun hanging out with Strani.
I hope you had fun hanging out with Strani.
Were you having a good time?
I heard you got some treats.
You got some candy.
And some toes.
Or something.
Something about toes.
Does she have like gummy toes?
I am live.
I thought you were dumb.
Shut the fuck up.
Stuff my stockings up your nose.
Yeah, like she was having candy.
There's nothing else on that stream, right?
Does anyone hire a priest?
I am a priest.
I'm a priestess.
Sorry for the到底's on the server, sorry.
I got a call from two people.
Why are you looking at me online flat out?
Are you from China?
No.
Are you from Milan?
What can I do for you?

She's homosexual. History. She's a gossip columnist.
What the hell? One of my frickin lady whistle down from Bridgerton.
Great show, by the way.
Let's see. Oh, there's different dominatrix.
All right, like, I gotta pick that.
I had, like...
What?
Ex-gymnastripper?
What?
It's a doom seer.
Oh, she, I just have severe anxiety. Also me.
Subtly insane. Also me.
Occult nut. Also me. I could be deaf?
Wait, if I'm deaf in the game, will I just not hear any dialogue?
Gymnastripper? I know, it's like very specific.
I was, like, I did do gymnastics for a little bit.
But, like, I don't, and it was never a stripper.
Although I do want to learn how to do pole for, like, 3D stuff.
That'd be super cool. Long and little foot.
Wait, I would just have one foot longer than the other?
Are you fucking, why the fuck would I ever pick that?
Okay.
But I like the crazy shit of a Malkavian.
Completely bad shit.
Okay.
I'm probably, yeah, maybe Ventrue. We're gonna be...
Oh.
Why is it showing that?
Why is it showing, I didn't show my old games before.
She.
Shibbit.
You guys know my PL anyway, it doesn't fucking matter.
Shit.
Shibbet.
Wait, no, Shabethany, duh.
Hi, I'm Shabethany.
Shabelle?
Shabella, Shabron James, okay, okay.
I'll make a pole for the name.
Shabethany.
Shabelle.
What is it, Shabritney?
Shabinaldo, nah.
I'm not gonna be Shabron, well, you know.
Shabron.
I'm not putting Shibiti toilet.
Shabbatha, no.
Shibesi, what?
Shibinachi, spiral?
What was it?
Yeah, I'm gonna put Shib, Shibusi.
Shibidi-dibidi-doo.
I love you, Shibusi.
I'll spell it a different way, though.
Shibbuse.
Alright, go crazy.
Shib-palpatine.
Shibralter.
Shibyonse.
Icy demands it.
Trickle down Shibon-
I've placed Shibonix.
Shib, Shib, Shibinomics.
I can't even.
Shab- Shabelle mentioned, no.
What was that book about the vampire rabbit?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Guys, is Shabuse really winning right now?
Oh, but Nikula, yes, that's true, that's true.
Shabonomics, this is Finland.
Shabuya, Shabelle, Delfin, Nani.
Okay.
Shabonomics.
It was Shibuse.
We are Shibuse.
I'm generally surprised that it showed my last save
because when I was setting everything up before,
I was double checking if I had any save files
and it said I didn't.
And then when I put in the name before,
I was trying to speedrun to see if stuff worked
and it was like put in a name
and it didn't show any name.
Spooky, okay.
So I get automatic that.
Where did the audio go?
If there's like no audio in this part.
I had an apostrophe to make it classy.
But where?
Shibuse.
It just makes me sound so fucking ghetto.
Let's see.
This kind of doesn't matter to me
because I might do some like cheatsy doodlin
and like fucking
add shit later.
I think I'm gonna do firearms.
Yeah.
And intimidation naturally.
Can I not?
Yeah.
And then, you know, I should do knowledge and finance.
I'm making it based off of me.
I'm not making it based off of anything else.
Wait, what?
Game is haunted by my past life.
Rene.
Rene.
Rest in peace.
Rest in peace.
A little bit cheating for the bit.
Oh, what do you mean?
Like this?
Hold on.
I can't copy, paste.
Oh, wait.
Question mark.
Ah, that looks a lot better.
Thank you guys.
You want to do the
play you as well?
What the fuck?
Why does the question mark show up
when it goes too far?
I don't even know if this still sounds the same.
What is that?
My chat just fucking
exploded for some reason.
What are Shibi's best attributes?
Yappage.
Charisma.
100%.
Charisma.
100%.
I'm pretty strong.
It makes my intimidation go up,
which would be cool.
My research
range combat would be better.
Again, none of this really fucking matters.
Why can't I?
I wish I could put it under physical.
Investigation.
Scholarship.
My persuasion would go up for that.
Haggle.
The 10 hour stream stamina.
I can't add anything to stamina though.
Dominate.
Put that up.
Knowledge.
It's more important than
whatever the fuck that guy says.
Knowledge.
Persuasion.
I might do that for persuasion.
Computer hacking.
Wait.
Hold on.
Fuck that.
Put that there.
Wait, what?
Fuck.
Can we do one?
All right.
Is that everything?
It is.
Computer kind of useless,
but it
fine.
We are
really persuasive.
Christmas and Dominate.
Yeah, I'm going to dummy mommy through the thing.
Here in my garage.
My brand new Lamborghini.
Just remember the pass codes.
My
seduction is at three.
What?
Can we get a four?
Yeah, I'm not really intimidating.
Let's do that.
You totally go cool for me.
I'm going ghost.
Very sweet.
You guys are so sweet.
So fucking sweet.
What the hell?
Where my mouse go?
It's a phantom.
It's my extensive
Warhammer 40K
painted figurines.
Oh no, I got some paint on you.
For a dominatrix.
Why am I in such a shit place?
Why am I in such a shit place?
Why am I in such a shit place?
I don't think it's ever coming out.
I'm so sorry.
I just feel it.
The thing, the company went under, didn't they?
What the?
Step through the heart.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Good evening.
He looks like ten times shorter next to his goon.
They're making it.
Then is there another company that's taking it on?
I like it's like five people in the audience.
Oh, honey.
Ew.
Fuck off with that.
Check the watch.
That's not on his wrist.
Is it meant to be just subtitles?
Fine, is it too quiet?
Well, you're gonna have to wait.
Fine.
Was game about being a killer, Bella?
12 vampires.
Did more people get up in the audience?
He is rocking that shit.
He is like a cup.
He's looking like he's from a clockwork orange.
He got the fucking cloud sword.
Everybody's faces.
It's gonna be me.
Bro, he spawned.
Why is everybody's eyes so shifty?
This is bullshit.
Nine's really pretty, though.
I feel like how their eyes glance about
is probably the most weirdest thing
that's realistic in this game.
Nobody's blinking.
They blinked.
They blinked.
They blinked.
They blinked.
They blinked.
They blinked.
They blinked.
They blinked.
They blinked.
Nobody's blinking.
They blinked.
Nine's is hot.
Nine's is nice.
Okay, now what?
I was just here to dom people.
I don't know what happened.
There was handcuffs and I handcuffed him.
Then he like showed me his more hammer figurines
and then stabbed me with one of his really small paint brushes.
I'm not a vampire.
I'm human.
I hate their posture in this game.
I wish I could like, it's like being with my head cut off
when I'm wearing the outfit on my model.
Like, what the fuck is up with the posture?
My neck is broken.
I have scoliosis.
But honestly, this game,
I fucking love this game.
Like the aesthetic of this game so much.
It's cord mod posture.
Maybe your character is sad.
So just like real life for some of us.
Yikes.
It was ice if that's you bro.
I'm sorry.
I wish I could play this on controllers.
I could lean back.
You know what?
Lay in my chairboard.
Alright.
Oh fuck.
Oh god.
Oh Jake.
It's shake the dog.
Ah, look you know.
It's probably a lot for you to take in.
So why don't you let me show you the ropes?
What do you say?
Show me the ropes.
Show me the ropes.
Did somebody say show the ropes?
Okay anyways.
What voice should I give her?
I'm gonna put it to a vote.
The game's gonna be paused for a second.
Voice.
Or
Shibuse.
My voice.
Blue.
Why is bro looking like that?
Why is bro looking like that?
Dummy mommy.
AKA my patreon voice.
British.
Can I add a fifth one?
Cause I was gonna do valley girl.
Fuck my voice.
We're gonna do valley girl.
Oh, goodness gracious.
Lord hammer.
Let the games commence.
I was, wow.
I'm getting high praise for that.
Thank you.
Thank you everybody.
Wow.
You know, when I, when I joined this company, I didn't know.
I didn't know.
When I, when I joined this company, I didn't know.
That's my boobs creep up.
I didn't know that I would just be so in touch with my body
and be able to burp on command.
So I'd like to thank the academy.
I'd like to thank Strani, my gen mates.
Throw it in the montage.
Good D volume on that one.
Is it, is it Dummy mommy?
Want the Dummy mommy voice?
All right.
From a landslide.
Yes.
Okay.
The Patreon voice.
Got again to character.
Who are you?
I'm Jack.
Hmm.
I don't have much time.
Just give me the basics.
You think I can do that voice?
No.
The wink killed me.
Did I accidentally wink?
Okay.
The Vtuber company?
I know all about them.
Lemon squeezy.
Are we going in sneaky-beaky like?
Wrong text.
Speech voice.
Wasn't it enough?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Wrong text.
Speech voice.
Wasn't it an option?
I'm so sorry, Heron.
I'm listening.
This will probably be a long stream too.
I don't think I'll do another 10 hours for
Vampire of the Masquerade,
but I do really like this game,
so I might go a little bit past time.
I don't want to be a homicidal maniac.
But I want to be a homicidal maniac.
I was like, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
I think so.
That's funny.
I'll sleep the day off and laugh later.
See ya.
Okay.
Oh!
Brap Friends?
Brap Friends Doko?
That was less than the other one?
Okay, fine.
Why do I live in a shithole?
I always wonder that.

Um hold on I want to make sure of something
But I do something properly
You
Sorry don't mind me looking up a walkthrough
You
Face this is the way
Uh, I just want to make sure I can romance the both of them. So instead of just only one of them
It's very important to me

It didn't work out and I was really depressed afterwards. I just want to make sure
So
I'm the proprietor of this club and the only person in this city whose good side it's in your best interest to stay on
What brings you to Santa Monica?

Tongue's exile is self-imposed. I assure you but then what reason would I have not to hate that lonesome nasferatu scoundrel
Bloody nosferatu. Oh my god. Is that miko hatune in the background?
Is that hatune miko?
People
Why do you hate him he meddles in my affairs
He's a bad influence on my sister and she on him if you were in my place
Would you let him compromise your authority? You're most certainly would not I'd quite like it if I never hear that name again
I'm so sorry I uh
I
I'm so sorry teres. I didn't mean to burp in your face
Why would I do that?
Let him think I mean to kill him that way
I didn't know this was the case
Do you realize how this is happening?
I literally cuffed the microphone and I was like
Oh
Um
That's unfortunate, but I do need to see him tongue and his co-conspirators actions ruined my chance at parties
I don't know why I'm so sorry
I don't know why I'm so sorry
I don't know why I'm so sorry
Tong and his co-conspirators actions ruined my chance at partnership in a crucial piece of property
I do have several other promising ventures and one in particular has been
To save at least an ordeal
I'd be willing to put the word out that my grievances with tongue have been swept under the rug
But in return you'll have to help my god. I want a burrito from chipotle suddenly

Then I waited an hour
And then I uh went to the chipotle app and I canceled my order and they refunded me
and then
At like 9 p.m. And mind you I went at 6 to pick it up
They're like my order was ready
I still got a notification it was ready and I'm like
Do I drive all the way back to fucking chipotle to
get
no
I'm like well
Some like I was going to
And I'm like I don't
Feel like I'm like I'm all comfy in bed. I'm like curl up with my little show
With my kitty cats and I'm like I'm not crawling out of bed to get free like I'm like whatever
I already I think I already already like made myself like um
Some food anyways in the end
So I was just like really pissed and then the last time
They made
They forgot like half of the ingredients again and then for the salsa so you guys know I can't handle spice
Like I can only hand I can handle a little bit of spice, but like they're spiciest sauce I can't handle
I put like the mild salsa in there. They gave me the spiciest one
So I bit into it and I almost fucking died
And then they gave so and then as a like a thing
They gave me like a buy one get an entree free and I'm like what the fuck am I gonna do with two entrees
Who the fuck am I gonna buy it for I'm it's just me
And it was like there's a certain amount of time I could use it
I'm like this is a fucking stupid. I can't even use this
You think I have friends no
Oh, yeah, it's and then like another time about that they just like
They just keep fucking up. They didn't like they didn't remember stuff or like they didn't oh so bad
I hate like but I'm like I just want like cheapo
fake
Spanish food
Like please
Never heard chipotle is begin what you said it must have been that yeah, I'd like don't eat there
Although there's another one that's like farther away from me. That one's fine
I'm like what the fuck?
Sorry white gal variant about chipotle
Gladly, what do I have to do rumor is that a personal item of a ghost maybe there's a taq area
That's open to me that I think I can order burrito from while I don't put a lot of stock in here say
It's my last option. So I want you to go to the ocean house hotel find an item of the spirits and bring it back
I'll do it if you promise to call off the feud
Oh, I fully intend to do so
You'll find that dealing with me on the whole is appreciably more looking to be up and down and I'm about to arc
Oh
So long as our business doesn't go sour. My word is gold
Can I just
Unbutton
Your shirt possible
Before I forget take this the only way to reach the ocean house
It's dangerous to go alone take this that key to open the gate for that tunnel

Right. Goodbye
Oh, let me switch. I can't see the chat
Oh my god, my nose is fucking itchy
These assets in the game run the game star trick bridge command was made on the same time the same time graphics

I literally walked into this office
I grabbed something off the desk and it literally like opened the thing and then I got
Like
30 experience points that that's a cheat that's that's a hack in the game. It's like people don't know about it
It's little like it's a little bit lesser known
But uh, you know it is what it is, you know
I don't really care about that
That's so crazy, isn't it
So cool
I know I'm so skilled. I don't I'm just so cracked like that story like something, you know

I'm testing you
Fuck
Is that a
Hey look it's one of emi's rats
This little guy just hanging out swimming
You little dude why is it's like really flooded down here. I hope he's okay
Testing our knowledge
I actually really like this part of the game
That's why I want to play it again
Again
Because there's there's also if you can skip this as a way to skip it
Not that I know I like play the game straight through but you know, so I see my next schedule
I'll be posting that after stream
Honestly, it's a lot of the same stuff I played a lot this week
Yes, I can tell you now I'm playing
Uh, another craps treasure again, I'm playing vampire the masquerade again. I'm playing bunny garden
I'm playing we're doing a power wash simulator collapse
Excuse me, um
What else am I doing hold on let me just pull it up right now because I can't remember
I don't even know what bunny garden is about
I'm just like bunnies
I'm in
My manager sent me my schedule
Oh, yes, I'm doing the reading fan fiction. So please submit fan fictions to me
And then I also have
An asmr roleplay where your trash your literal trash
The inspiration comes from
Uh, I need to make a schedule folder. Let me do that right now
Schedules schedules actually I probably already have one. I just don't know where oh I did it's literally above it
I'm actually stupid. Um, it's in the vein of like a heather feather one
That I used to love that was like one of the first times I got tingles
Can I I don't know which one to delete
Which one's the newer one? Oh, this one's the newer one, okay
I can't I delete it
Fuck I deleted the wrong one. It's fine
I'm already in character. Yeah, so I'm gonna get some stuff this week probably to
Um get some really good triggers. I'm not gonna be as
As I was last time
This is not it hold on this isn't it. It's my old one. I'm just changing it out. Oh
This is my schedule you heard it here folks
Was that too stream reading submitted fan fictions ignore the bottom part I was like
Um, I'm like, um
Not a son you did you just put sub description or collab under
Manpower the masquerade bloodlines part two, so I'm waiting for them to get back to me fixing that
um
POV or trash and then yeah, so this is that that's the schedule. I'm very excited for power simulator
collab feet my genmeads
You look lonely I can fix that
Yeah, great art. Thank you. Um sly ukai or yuka one
Great
You wink
And I hope we get monetization soon
I
I'm enjoying my old twitter
I don't know what you're talking about what old twitter
Where do people submit fanfics yes in my maros you can submit it in my maros
Um, I want it to be in the vein of like my immortals so like super cringy really bad
um
Some people have sent me like really nice ones like really well written and I'm like no
I said
cringy
Tarot me me ones or even ones like you don't have to write them yourselves like like
If you were to write one you can make about me or my gen mates and you can make it like cringy you can self insert
That's fine or you can do like a your name like y slash n
Um, I want the cringe. I want to be like fangs because I'm gothic like my immortal type
And if I don't like anything that's submitted I'm probably just gonna read my immortal
Um, if if anyone's gonna convince youtube to want to test your channel, it's definitely you um, I'm also working on
Um
Making the first class of 9
Uh play through public again. I was editing it
Um, so that's fine. I left some funny stuff in there though. Uh, I don't know if it's processing
Can you submit a high sonic high school fail? I'll hunt. That's what I'm looking for. That is literally what I'm looking for
So that would be perfect. Um
So I don't I might wait till I get monetized to
Make it public again
My stream was historical. Yeah, I was rewatching it like parts of it and I was
cackling at myself
And at my ac in the background
Um, but yeah, I'm gonna wait
To get monetized before I publicize that again. It was very fun. Yes, I will definitely probably play class of 9 again
But that'll be like later in the future or maybe I'll do it as a gorilla sometime
Um, I definitely want to play a little bit of call of the lamb again
You know, I'll probably do another endurance stream for that. Riley. I just got another boss
I was like endurance stream and this like kill a boss each time
Or or two
um
And then like you can also like recommend me games and my murals and stuff that you'd like me to play because again like I
Grew up playing a lot of fps's. I'm not even good at them. Um, so I
I want to widen my horizons in terms of games
So if you have game suggestions
cool
Or I'm just gonna end up playing flavors of the month like bunny garden. I don't even know what it's about
I think there's like hot girls in it
Hopefully my character shows up for call of the lamb. Yeah, I actually really oh, I'm gonna play inscription with crowd control
100%
I'm like actually like a little bit tempted to like yoink
Bunny garden and do inscription with crowd control. I I really like crowd control games. Um, because I really like
You guys interacting. I wouldn't
Play through inscription. I would probably just play
the first part
um
Just because the game is like I I've finished inscription before it's literally one of my favorite games of all time
um
Like the first part is like the best and then the second part's like a little bit confusing and was really frustrating for me to get through
the part with
Robot version is good and then the parts after that are like, okay, so, um
I really like you guys nice to get free bro wrong
But you don't you don't want to be my boyfriend girlfriend. You want to be my boyfriend girlfriend girlfriend boyfriend
What's up? What's up? What's up? What's up?
Um
Bolivian is going to bucket list. Uh, I'm pretty sure
Strawny's playing skyrim next week
So I probably wait a little bit like a couple months. I do before I play skyrim
um
I have a bolivian. I could probably play a bolivian
Um, I only did a little bit of bolivian before has crowd control work. It's pretty cool because um
You guys get like coins and like sometimes like you can purchase coins if you want you guys don't have to
I'm trying to figure it out. So you guys don't like can you get more free coins to mess around with stuff?
And uh
You can control aspects of my stream
And like my gameplay and I that's why I like I think like for example with the description because it's like
It's almost like hearthstone or it's like it's a card game and stuff
Um, you just like make my hand all bees or whatever instead of like me having like a more boris or something
So I think that would be really fun. Um, that's why I only want to do like the first part because I know you guys like I
Like I fucking love inscription. Um
I want to play pony island 2 when it comes out because I play pony island
Could you make everything just one coin or something? No, that'd be too easy. Are you kidding? So you want to do? Hold on, let me just
Like weird weird angle since you want to do more of a variety of games
I've thought about trying out rts or turn based strategy games
Give me an example of that
and I have
Like done the beam out of four and it was pretty good
One coin would be chaos
Um, but I'll I'll probably like look through some of the crowd control games and like get a couple
balder's gate
I like fire emblem three houses
He he he um
Because I like
The romancing in the story
Oh, yeah, I definitely want to play hades because people have suggested hades. It's like yeah, I turned off martyr the lamb
um
balder's gate
I'm not
I'm kind of impatient when it comes to those games
I don't I'm not a huge fan of turn based games, but fire emblem three houses, which was the first fire emblem game I played kind of
Um, and then I played a little bit of like the one that Iksen that I can't remember the top of my head
Um, and I do like it, but it just
I'd have to because like I have but I literally have balder's gate on my playstation
I only played like three hours of it though
Yes, I play pathically a little bit of pathoradians
um
I'd play diablo like that would be cool. I'll like I'll play diablo. I actually like diablo
um
But maybe balder's gate and I also don't know if my pc would be able to handle balder's gate because it's like pretty
Intensive I have slay the princess. I would I would totally play slay the princess
uh, I used to play warframe a lot when
um
I needed a titanfall fix and like I don't think destiny was a thing yet
I'm a awakening figure it on me like oh, I mean
I don't need one of those
I have a capture card and I have every game console. Let me talk about
Warframe at the harem. I don't know if I would play warframe again though
I haven't touched that game and like
To 3d yet. Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. Don't worry about 3ds style
I can make it run on the 3ds and hook it up to my computer
fashion frame
uh, I remember I used to just focus in all the
The outfits in that game. I was like full pearl pink or whatever
um
I haven't touched that game in like so fucking long
subverse. I don't know what that is
Three houses or nothing
You got tired of war. Yeah warframe was super grindy like I don't mind grindy games
Like I played the shit out of destiny 2 and destiny 1 those things, you know around
And I know like like I'm notorious for starting games and not finishing them like games really have to capture my attention
like
That's why I like inscription and call the lamb
If they're in the same vein as that I'll probably really like it
Uh, it's an at plus game. Oh, yeah, I want to play hoony pop when we eventually get our fanslies
That'd be so fun because I've been playing a lot of match three games
I've yeah, I've been recommended hall and I before
Um, I know that people are like bummed or whatever that there's not a like the another game hasn't come out
I can't remember
Um
Having awful I still yeah, I I want I played the most recent diablo and I really I played it for like a pretty long time
I don't even remember what level I am and then I guess got distracted by other stuff
Dead cell no
I haven't played dead cell all night he goes asleep
Dark and dark girl there or the girl. I don't know what that is
Strange question to ask but do you enjoy puzzle styles games? I mean, I'm really shitty at puzzles

Uh, I got cyberpunk darkwood. I do like darkwood. That's a cool game. Um, destiny don't starve
Uh, there's a game that I got I got an early access key to because someone gave it to me

Watching gameplay trailer
Hurry up
What is it
Oh my god, I don't want to fuck a robot
Is there a post in a funny meme this morning about if your vibrator turned into a transformer?
And then you anyways
This looks sick. Where's the gameplay? I want gameplay. Show me gameplay
Okay, there's only screenshots gameplay preview, sorry
Elaborate mini transformers. Did you find your rose? No
No
Oh, I know ultra kill ultra kill. It's really fucking good
It gave me like super hot vibes for some reason but gory super hot. I don't know if that's true
Yeah, I'm too scared
It's just taking too long. I want to see gameplay
Wait, is the gameplay I asked for gameplay? I can't scroll forward
What the fuck is it? Oh, it's from from front. You will say it's not a souls leg, but it's from from software
Okay, I might have to I might have to cut that
I gotta I might gotta get that
I
Gotta
Oh my god
Oh my god, it reminds me
Of titanfall when you're in the mech. I fucking love titanfall and I miss this so much
I fucking hate apex legends so much fuck apex legends. You took away titanfall 3 for me
I hope the game
Fucking rots
Sorry
Okay, yeah, I might have to get that
Oh, shout out the retreat June 20. Sorry, that was like a my recommended
I don't think titanfall 3 is ever gonna happen. Remember it takes July 5th 1921
It's pretty hard
Could you stream of titanfall 2? Yeah, I can do that
I
I repeat titanfall I love multiplayer like I would oh like
Like that in destiny were the only like fps games that was actually good at and I would usually be a top frag
If it's caught I'm just like kind of there. I'm like kind of in the middle
Titanfall come out at the same time as half life 3 don't call us suckers
God boo
I just like the wall running. I know it's such a cool feature in titanfall
I'm so guys they're not gonna do titanfall 3 apex legends
Is just like a the like a little piggy bank for them full of money. They don't need to make titanfall 3
You all did get alex that's true you got alex
I want to be held and
Cradled by my titan daddy
Apex is the font titanfall 3. You'll see I wish though. I know I think they're adding
I think there was like whispers of them adding one of the titans
In the game
In apex
as something
And could probably fill a titanfall 2 lobby of playing with viewers. Yeah, but like the game is so fucking I think it's like super
buggy
And hacky and isn't right like multiplayer doesn't load properly
I'm often coping over here
Oh my god
Loud neighbors again
Angel city is an apex map. Oh
I
Angel city was one of my favorite maps if they added like it'd be so fucking easy to add titanfall maps
To apex I would play I would I won't lie. I'll play if they added
titanfall maps
I would they'd rather make apex legends 2 than titanfall 3. I know it fucking sucks
Or this they might be
Beautiful lady tell me do you have a dream and what is it?

Any of those five target star weapons or characters like I tried playing honkai star rail and I was bored
is that
Is that a hot take
Fuck what is this where did it go did my thing crash?
Oh, yeah
It's like new food places going up near me
So I opened
Google on my phone and the first thing I see is the kirby gift of him like sucking somebody's arm that I posted on strani
thing
If any be honest, I'm more tan on my legs than you and I'm full
Listen, I haven't been outside in a very long time if you saw my face in my hair you'd be like, okay, she's brown
But if you any other aspect of my body is white woman jumpscare
Honkai was was me
I don't really know if you squint after playing genshin weathering waves
I thought weathering waves was like a book title, but I was like getting used to the weathering heights
Honkai and azur lane together you see don't well. Yeah, they're all
You can see these different settings
What did even I don't even I just discovered weather weathering waves like
Two days ago or whatever the fuck early a couple of days ago, and I'm like, where did this come from?
What the heck happened
Kirby is canonically a cosmic horror
I believe that
You are so real for posting that kirby gift. Thank you. Do you guys pronounce it gif or jiff?
I
Hard g
I like how you guys are just spelling out gif and like not being like
Gif or okay, well if you spell gif like the peanut butter that does make it more sense
Gif I actually I think I like
You say the you say the letters gif
My name is gif my name is gif
Gif more like gilf gif
It's gif not gif
I'm sorry that'd be like this is a fucking
Funny as comic like these two guys
Like arguing over stuff
Like it's gif no it's gif and then it's like a furry just like bust out the door and be like gif and it's like heavily demonic
I
Gif oh yes
I can't remember the name. Oh I found it thank god
No, they're fucking closed
That's why I didn't work
Guys I'm gonna cry. I really wanted a burrito from this place
What should I get instead?
Here I'm gonna look at you again. What should I get instead? I'm holding you in my lap
Pronounce it greg
So I mean well it's a sunday so you know it's a it's the day of our lord
It's only fair
I
Who am I fighting
Taco bill sinabon the lights
I actually trifles for the first time like a week or so ago because I didn't have
Um I didn't go grocery shopping. So I just ended up ordering taco bill and I had one bite of those
I want and I'm like no thank you. It tastes like greasy cream cheese
I was I was okay with that. I didn't even eat them. It was a waste of money. I'm sorry
People take gif versus gif. What's another thing people like
Like oh is a hot dog a sandwich? That's my favorite. What do you guys is a hot dog? It's all we're gonna put it to a poll
Sorry you guys are dropped in my lap
Is a hot dog a sandwich me personally it's a taco
Is cereal soup yes
Smell the ice cream soup yes
Is water wet
I have to think about that one
Um a ravioli is just an empanada
I
No, I ain't never had a real taco everything hot no hot dog is a taco 100%
Is whiskey catch what?
Cereal first I'm not a sociopath you leave empanadas out of this
Is pizza an open-face sandwich hmm
Legally a hot dog is a sandwich
Hot dog is a sandwich if you need to specify the kind of sandwich
Uh, I think a hot dog is a kind of taco
Water with cereal what are you fucking on
Hot dog is a taco and tacos are sandwich no no no no no you got it all wrong
Is a calzone an empanada yes just an italian empanada
Water makes things wet, but it's not what itself, but
but
If water makes things wet and water
What did I ever get what the fucking we're gonna say if water makes things wet because it's wet that just answers the question itself
Water's wet because it makes things wet
Can water be dry I think actually technically
In a different form maybe I don't know water what's water there you go
Auto's neutral state is wet you know what also who's neutral state is wet your mom
Got him
I'm like looking at where my phone stand when my phone is in my hands is ice wet yeah
Aper is dry water there you go
Not my mom my mom
Okay, now I have to find another place to eat
Fucking hate it here
Uh
There's another
taqueria
And I wanted that taqueria

I haven't had sushi in a long time now I think of about it
Water is a tech why am I just like how my model froze um sushi's how expensive though yeah you're right
She ate it
I just finished my sashimi and now I want more yeah
I'd like sushi always doesn't like really fill me unless I have like like a couple rolls and I and then it'll just be expensive
I guess I'll starve
Because I am indecisive as hell
What do I have in the fridge?
I have chicken tendis frozen. I have salmon frozen

Don't know
Definitely need to charge them. Um, oh, I forgot I looked at candle burning
Okay, I can't blow from there, um

There's literally just like a bunch of spanish food trucks around
And get chilies welcome to chilies

Pasta places that's true that would fill me up
There's an olive garden nearby on crustables. I think I have one on crustable left
You can unfroze them in the microwave Ernest

i don't know i'm sorry it's kind of sexy well nevermind that's it
i got feeders in my audience
i love a woman that can destroy food to be honest it's funny because like i remember
i like had my so like my friend went on a date and um i was like lingering nearby
because i was like worried for her deeply and um because you know you can't trust these these places
these sites and the guy walked out on her because she ordered food
like she ordered like a normal amount of food like she ordered like entree appetizer a drink
and then i like talked to her afterwards because i was like fucking off somewhere else
with our other friends because it wasn't just me it was more than um did your food no i haven't yet
i still haven't thought of anything um we were like eating someplace nearby me and our friends
and we're like oh redacted what happened and she's just like he said i was like not like he didn't
like directly call her a pig from what she was saying but like he kind of like insinuated she
wasn't like ladylike because she got so much food and we're like me and the other girls are like
we'll fuck him anyways margaritas
so he got mad because she i don't like did like i'm like did you order something expensive
and she's like no i just like got a burger and i'm like okay did he wink at her oh my god that's so
fucked um but well it like it sucked because like he left and so she paid for both their meals
and so like me and the other girls we like took her out and she didn't have to
to spend any money because like that's so fucked yeah he did the the dip
none of us fucking noticed either we're like really bad not sticking stuff out we're not reliable
ah the napsel she'll have the salad literally i think that's what he expected her to get like a salad
and like she's like a normal sized girl too like she's not like heavy she's not super skinny
but she she's like literally the most normal looking girl you could ever see
but he every day he could have been just like fuck like i don't know he could have been like
pulling uh like a fast one on her like to get free food i don't fucking know
you got your back see something shiny literally though
because we were we were enjoying our own food down the street someplace else
you just need an excuse to dip
guys i don't want to get okay fuck it i'm gonna order for i'm kind of wanting something soupy
the girl invited me on a date and it's a korean barbecue to the keeper
there's like no korean barbecue places near me i've never had korean barbecue in my life
i heard it's really good
the way he thought he could have still free meal unless he was trying to split something
fuck it you're missing out you know
okay
i like this has oxtail
steak and flank so that's kind of fine
it comes with hoisin sauce and sriracha should i get
i'm not what's fish i've never had knock mom
chili oil i have some chili oil in my fridge so i don't like it by chili oil
or some wagyu beef i've had wagyu beef one time
and it was very underwhelming i got at this really nice restaurant
my parents were um celebrating a uh like a the fuck what was it
what's the word i wasn't a raise a promotion i got and we ordered like this wagyu sushi
and it didn't taste like anything but except like they added like a lot of like decorative
flowers to it so it just tastes like burnt flowers
like a sweet sour sauce
meat sweats for these
tartar no it wasn't like a tartar
i don't know
wagyu sushi yeah it was like
topped with wagyu
a minute order some spring rolls
like others just turn into a fucking zatsu
wagyu coming yeah it was like topped with like wagyu on and it was pretty good
super inconsistent it was like you just got scammed maybe probably
i'd show a picture but then you guys probably like hunt down the place
because it looked amazing it did not taste good at all it was a waste of money
and it was like 30 bucks no it was more than that
it was like 50 bucks for the roll
american japanese wagyu it was like a fusion restaurant and they had said it was japanese
wagyu i know american is different
but you know maybe one day i'll off-cloud with the girls when we're like go to japan
and have like actual wagyu that'd be really cool i always wanted to go to japan
or maybe you guys misgendered my cat kind of disappointed
your thigh looks rough do you have a skin condition
i'm sorry i'm reading the comments under
no i don't know how does it look rough like i have um
um what's it called
the most a lot of girls have usually just edit it out of their photos by the way
um like strawberry legs or whatever it's called
uh where you just get like you can kind of see like
your skin is like thin enough you can almost see where the hair would grow
keratosis polaris yeah strawberry skin yeah like i have strawberry skin
mind you i didn't throw any filters on it if i threw filters on it then you would
be like oh wow her skin is so sooky smooth don't believe anything you see on the internet
everything's edited start no i'm not strawberry blonde i'm not strawberry blonde
give it on your arms yeah like it's like it's like it's very normal but i like
is your skin rough yes i'm like a cat's tongue it's sandpaper oh me running by
um no upper arm yeah a lot of people have it the cat was edited

like people will send like i know that's probably like the more intentional being like me
and they're like generally curious like they said um or people will send like troll stuff in my maros
and it's like if i have to fight the urge to troll people back so often
like you know people try to like dom me in my maros or whatever

No, don't eat bull, that one, and when you not come here, here you go.
I have a dual feeder, and then I have another feeder in the other room.
And Phi is patiently waiting for the one in the other room.
Okay.
Streaming for another 10 hours stream.
How long have I been streaming for?
I'm also like, I'm streaming a lot because I know I won't be able to stream as much when I go back to work.
So I'm just wanting to stream as much as possible.
Did they put any noodles in here?
Okay.
There's not a lot of meat in here though.
I'm kind of bummed.
It said oxtail, there's no oxtail in here.
It's only like steak and flank.
Whatever.
5 hours?
Oh, okay.
Pineapple pizza that I make, I get some white alfredo sauce, salami, ham, pineapple, red onions.
Ooh, some barbecue sauce.
I recommend hot honey.
I've had, I went to this, like, I can't remember what the brand of the place is called, but they put hot honey on it.
3 a.m. for you.
Go to sleep.
Have a good one.
Oh, this is hot.
I can't really.
I just burned myself a little bit.
There's like, blade's pizza.
Maybe it was.
I don't know.
Blade's pizza's pretty good.
Ooh, baby.
May tacos?
Ooh.
My leash.
I require sustenance.
The food and bowl is already 5 minutes old.
Honestly, that's how Reina is.
Reina's a very picky eater.
I don't blame her though.
She's 14.
She deserves to be picky at her age.
She has kidney disease, so normally her thing is really low protein.
Sometimes I give her a little treat and I give her, like, wet food.
That's, like, mostly protein.
She likes it a lot.
Because honestly, at her age, I just want her to be happy.
And, you know, eat.
Have you worked at Blade's Pizza?
Oh, that's cool.
I've never worked in fast food.
Gotta squeeze a little bit of lime in here.
Be pampered.
Yeah, I pamper her so much.
My cousin came over in my apartment once.
And, like, I love, like, so much cat shit everywhere.
And, like, the cats have really nice water fountains and automatic feeders.
And she's like, do they live in a fucking five-star hotel?
And I'm like, oh, I guess so.
Okay, I got that.
They used to put the sauces in, like, little containers.
And now they don't.
And then you just have to, like...
Like, how am I supposed to...
I like to, like, take, um...
Did they even eat chopsticks?
Okay, they did.
Chibi's cats are Wonderland VIPs.
Oh, it'd be so cool if I could get them in, like, some art.
And, like, in the background or, like, sitting on my desk.
And I'm, like, very, like, evil-looking.
And I'm just like, I've been expecting you.
Harim.
Harim.
Took an app.
You're still streaming?
Is this endurance streaming?
I just, like, streaming for a piece of time,
because I don't have anything else to do.
Although I could, like, play or, like, watch something.
Shari, like, messes me.
She's like, I'm so proud of you, my daughter.
You're just, like, mommy.
And I'm like, I don't even know if this is because of the endurance streaming.
I'm not sure if it's because of the cat.
Yeah.
Hello, very much, how are you, my noodles?
They're so tasty.
Hello, very much, how are you, my noodles?
They're so tasty.
I didn't know that.
Normally I stream for, like, at least three or four hours.
Two if I'm not super tired.
Like, streaming in general?
I've been streaming for five hours now, apparently.
My bar time starts up on the 17th.
I'm very vegan, it was my car.
Not wash was,
probably responsible for the puppies.
Ten if I'm not spicy.
Ten if I'm not

What are you doing?
I heard some.
Why are you crying?
Can you hear me out in the laundry room?
What's up?
I think he's bored and he was looking for a toy to play.
He's like, ah!
Yeah, you knocked your spring under the couch.
There's like 20 under there.
You and your sister.
Portable stove and a big pot.
She has a lot of good stuff.
I don't even know what she puts in her chicken or stew.
All I know is that it's slaps.
My mom's really good at stews and soups and baking.
Really like comfort-y foods.
I'm sorry, I'm speaking in bun-speak because I'm happy because I have food.
So my voice is a little bit higher.
Mm-hmm.
Is that autism?
I don't know.
And those can't compare to squish and ghetto crocs.
He's making a buzzer with cat crimes.
You don't have to follow your true voice to find something to pick you.
Oh my God, I almost tore from the sriracha again.
Oh my God, I hear my neighbors again.
The soundproofing in my building is really bad.
Also when I'm happy, I talk fast.
Aside from a shabari, unless it's just your persona,
what other things do you have at your comfortable sharing?
Do you do a tierless stream of that stuff?
Every membership?
I don't really think I can talk about that on a normal YouTube video.
I think?
I did a kink tierless before.
I don't know if it's floating around.
A lot of it I lied about anyways,
because I thought I was weird if I liked that stuff.
So I'm like, oh yeah, this goes on the bottom,
but now I'm like, I don't like it with shit.
And just so you guys know,
just because we were cast as certain characters,
does that mean we officially have those kinks?
Like, I'm a dom,
but I wear shabari ropes.
But I've actually never been tied up in shabari.
I feel like I would like it,
and that's why I wanted to research on it.
I don't want to do membership streams,
where I tie myself up in shabari, but yeah.
I'm kind of just learning.
And you guys are helping me learn.
And being corrupted.
As to your bionicles.
Lying on the internet, how could I?
No way that you were involved.
Yeah, that's true. Some of you guys are major degenerates.
Like the guy in my Marrow said.
Never mind, I'm gonna put him on blast.
He got his own stuff to deal with.
Yeah, I won't kink shame.
Some of you do deserve to be shamed.
I haven't looked at my Marrows today though.
I think it was all like one or two.
I'll probably end up answering Marrows tomorrow instead of today.
Alabama guy.
You're my cats and macros.
Because of my reaction, he's like,
I'm not gonna watch you.
I was mostly just a meming reaction if anything.
I might be slightly daffy when I'm Marrows.
Yeah, Marshmallow. It's almost like Curious Cat.
Or you could like ask anonymous questions.
Yeah, IRL, that's so true though.
Cause I'm like, oh, if it's like anime, hentai based,
I'm like, yeah, but if it's IRL,
I'm like, wait a second.
Just woke up, hello.
We hanging out.
Cause like,
for example,
I like monsters.
I'm not gonna fuck a monster in real life.
Cause one, they don't exist and two, out.
It's all in Japanese though.
Link is in the description if you want to try it.
Yeah, yeah, it says Japanese,
but you could like, usually depending on,
like I, to be honest with you guys,
I just answer all Marrows on my phone.
Cause my phone,
I mean, honestly, a lot of web pages just auto translate,
like, or there'd be Cromer Safari.
Oh my God, children are running in the hallway.
It's over for Venom cells.
Oh my God, Venom in the tongue.
I haven't even watched the most recent one.
What are your hobbies?
It's important to know things when you're dating somebody.
Well, it seems like you weren't paying attention
to the first date that we had,
which was my 2.0.
So I'm kind of offended that you're not a good listener.
Cause I talked to you all about all my hobbies in my 2.0.
And usually when people say like,
oh, keep this to yourself.
Cause no matter what, usually
I can answer Marrows.
And they are public,
unless you're logged in
and then you can send them privately
and I can respond privately.
And I can present you like something
like a pretty picture
or video.
But what if you were a rubber bunny?
Like a rubber ducky?
Huh?
What's your favorite monster?
I don't know why I keep joking.
Movie from a TV show?
Oh, alien? The alien from alien?
Do other people see the Marrow sent to you?
It's private unless you respond.
It's private unless they respond.
And then sometimes you guys will say stuff
and you're not logged in.
So if I respond, it will be made public.
Ow.
But to remind you,
it's anonymous no matter what.
If you have a username, I can't see it.
But
if you are not logged in
and you send me something
that has a sense of stuff in it,
I can't...
I'm not going to respond
because if I respond, it's going to
show everybody else what you said.
So I'm not going to do that to you.
So sometimes it will be like, oh,
she didn't respond to my Marrow
or what I said to her.
It's because you weren't logged in
and it was really sensitive
and I don't know if you want other people
to see what you sent me.
My hobbies?
Do you like to play video games?
Go for a long run across the beach?
I like to play instruments.
Okay.
Okay.
Marrow is so hot.
Is the rock so hot? No, I just...
I just choked.
Now I have something stuck in my throat.
Oh, the A.I.
Yeah, the A.I. also filters stuff.
Cat box link
waxes to the public. I almost did that once.
I think I sent you an Instagram
link on Marrow.
I've said this before in my Marows.
I feel like I'm from...
I'm Nick Cage from National Treasure
trying to put these links together
so I can understand what you guys are trying to send to me.
And then you guys send me litter box ones
and I can't...
I can't...
I can't see them the next day
when I'm not responding immediately
because it only has like two hours.
Why are you role playing?
I'm sorry, this is funny.
Marrow is a pain for cat box lately.
Well, cat box has been like
not working properly
because I know like Shawnee used to use cat box a lot.
Yeah, nobody uses cat box anymore
because it's just like not...
like sometimes cat box will just break.
Why do we have therapists here?
I don't know.
Do you want me to be your therapist for a moment?
Let's become more parasocial.
It's up to you.
A little bite.
I haven't seen the...
Freddie Fazbear guy.
I'm just a bummer
because I like reading his comments in my Gregory voice.
If you're gonna role play
at least type correctly
your grammar is atrocious
and it's disappointing to me
this date is over if you don't have proper grammar.
I was kidding, I don't talk in proper grammar.
At least put in some effort, man.
I'm just kidding.
Any case, if I can add a parasocial
right up on top of everything.
I don't know, we're just here to hang out.
You don't have to be parasocial.
Like for me a parasocial
because I'm only like talking to you guys.
Like I could have logged out hours ago
and stopped streaming
but I just like hanging out
because I like people to talk to.
It fucking got me, Jesus Christ.
I did not read the full sentence.
That's funny.
I actually really like
I would 100%
fuck any of the animatronics
from that
iteration
of Five Nights at Freddy's.
What is it?
Is it the glam rock?
Like rock is kind of hot
and so is Freddy.
Especially Monty.
I can't remember the other ones.
Chica.
Chica is kind of, you know, she kind of
she's a little bit, she's a bit loka.
So the question is
are you, fuck, I can't read that.
Are you dominating them?
Are you the one getting dominated?
I'm not answering that.
You don't need to know.
Gregory, if you want to escape
you need to donate at least $30
to SheebieCarve.
Please, Sheebie, look at my marrows.
I put my tiny peepee in cat box
so you can make fun of me, please.
Chica eats garbage, just like me.
He's just like me for real, for real.
Where you probably got pneumatic dong?
Let me be silly for a second.
So a lot of my OCs
were 100% like tulpas.
When I was growing up and I would draw my OCs
I would just like talk to them in my head
because they were real.
It would be just like a little schizophrenic and everything.
I can't wait to cut this out of the vlog.
His name was Zero and he was an android.
I'm a pent-up religious Christian girl
with OCs and I draw,
so I would just draw smut of me and my OCs.
I need to stop talking in my cute and funny voice.
I'm sorry.
My peepee.
And he had a go-go gadget peepee.
I wrote an OC name Zero.
I probably could draw him again and I had another OC.
His name was,
he was my sole eater OC.
So I had,
it would be really funny if the girl that I used to role-play with
with our OCs all together
because she was like my best friend.
She would totally like VTubers and if she comes across this,
I will actually probably pass away from this earth
if she recognizes who I am.
But I had another character.
He was my weapon.
So my OC was Kiri.
Kiri was,
she was essentially me but she had pink hair.
She's very cute, very pastel goff.
And then James Sinner was her
weapon.
And he was a scythe.
And he was kind of like almost like
he got a scythe from Akatsuki
from Naruto.
And he had like three
three blades.
And he also had like three beauty marks on his face.
And he had bright red hair.
And his family
were all
representations
of the seven license.
He was pretty, he was pretty sick.
Which out of the viewer girlies
would pull up pastel goff?
Look, I would say Icy.
Just checking, you mentioned people
setting a sense of contramarrow.
I appreciate it.
Every time I like tributes, I accept those.
I don't mind.
I may, I don't respond right away.
I like kitty on Twitter, she's adorable.
Yeah.
I don't mind them, I like videos.
Am I supposed, am I not supposed to be saying the quieter part out loud?
Are my kitty's there? Okay.
Oh, chilling.
Oh, Mercy, she's not fit for the goff thing.
Yeah, pastel goff is different though.
She would be, if anyone's so like,
I can like bright, so like
excuse me, Emmy would be just emo goff,
like a typical goff.
Mercy would be a seeing goff.
Icy would be pastel goff.
Icy
would be
just normal goff,
like Dami mommy alternative
black girl goff.
And then I would
I don't know what type of goff I would be
to be honest with you.
I didn't think about that.
What does not
being per socialist or king
around in the gathering of different
what the fuck are you saying, dude?
Are you wearing a fedora right now?
Base goff. Yeah.
I'll be one of those like industrial goffs.
Like, you know those like goffs that like the dancing goffs
and that one meme and them.
I'll be shuffling.
Superstar DJ.
It was funny when we were
me and Icy and manager
and the other girls were talking about like her DJ set.
We were talking about like
shuffling and stuff and we
and then managers post that song
with the OG like
Sydney shuffle, I think what it's called
video and I'm like, oh my fucking god, then be
and Icy were just fucking jamming.
We're just like don't don't don't don't don't
don't don't
don't don't don't don't
don't don't don't
I can't shuffle. I used to be able to shuffle.
Vampires in the club scene.
Oh, no, actually, I would be
the true blood goff.
Like I would be like fantasia.
One Eric Northman
is.
I love him
and
his
prod her knee. She was pretty hot too. I can't remember her name.
The second I'm dancing vampire game.
Yeah, that's my seed.
Wow. Can you put it that way?
Either way is fine. How long will he have?
Can someone help him?
It can someone.
What bro?
Bro, it's tweaking.
Are you?
Are you?
I know English is probably just not their first language.
I am wonder.
I wonder what would happen if a werewolf
and a vampire hook up? How would that work?
I'm very curious for your answer.
They would probably just hook up normally.
I don't know.
I think they would just hook up normally.
I don't think the wolf is going into wolf form
although
maybe I don't fucking know.
That's forbidden but that's true.
You know, it's a little Romeo and Julie at moment.
There's too much DMT.
Wolf vampire hybrids?
I am wonder.
Not now again.
Mr. Wolf
I think it's time to sleep.
Hold on.
What's that?
So SZA
What is the party over?
Get your ass to bed. You got school tomorrow.
Let's take a talk. Hi Rena.
You gonna come up here?
Miss Rena
Hey, could you not?
You guys are bad.
Well, when a werewolf and a vampire
love each other very much, they give each other a special hug.
Honestly, if I ever had a child
I would probably explain it like that.
I don't know why my model is lying.
Usually around this time my internet just like fucking dies.
Will I sleep? I think I'll sleep.
I didn't sleep.
I didn't sleep.
Yesterday
So
I am not.
Oh my god, not.
I mean, the real question is
Where will fuck the vampire human formable form?
I think it's funny because I got one of those toys
and people were like
So should we must really like dogs?
No, what the fuck is wrong with you?
My marrow is like hey
You like dogs?
And I'm like
I'm not Whitney Wisconsin dude
I made the joke before, I'll say it again.
Call her a leisure for you guys exactly.
Bark
Bark for me
Sorry, you just know many times.
Good puppies, good puppies.
Do you need to go outside and do pee pee?
Do you need to do pee pee puppy?
A lot of you guys asked me to talk to you like I talk to my cats.
Rina, Rina, what are you doing?
Are you purring?
Are you gonna purr for stream?
Reapers?
Rina
Oh to be a cat
She's a smugly.
Based on the cult stream we
Hi guys, we're just not finishing your sentences.
Yeah, I saw that.
I saw that. I saw that.
Adorable.
Rina is my soul kitty.
She's my best friend.
My mom
And
Me went to go pick up her and her sister.
Her sister has passed away a couple years ago.
She was 11.
We went to the cat breeder.
Sorry, I got you my nose.
And they're like
Oh yeah, these are the kittens that were reserved for you.
We went to a cat breeder because we had to
My mom has allergies so she wanted to make sure they were fine.
Although
Fia and Bumi don't even give me allergies.
Rina does.
So what was up with that?
Yeah, it's always an awesome cat.
She was a great cat. She was like a dog.
It was funny. She was my fetch.
She would like work at you.
But I held Rina
And I knew she was
Gonna be my best friend.
And
And I just held her like a little baby
And she was in my arm. She just looked at me
And she just purred.
And I'm like, yep.
And she has been
Back to me like glue ever since.
I'm gonna be very sad when she passes.
Cause she's getting up in age.
And she has, like, I saw the kittens and stuff.
So I just wanted to be happy
And healthy.
Yeah
She was 11
She was a seal point Siamese
So she was the typical
Siamese that you see.
They're Applehead Siamese
They're not Oriental Siamese
Which are those
The ones from Lady and the Tramp
Which are like the really
Skinny looking ones.
Oriental cats are so cute though.
They're kind of like goofy looking with their muzzles.
Almost have a future status.
But then I like think and I think all the
Sorry, my voice is broke for a second.
All the
Memories are just so worth it.
And you give them like a good little life.
Cause I rescued Fia and Bumi.
They initially came from Mississippi
In the south
They're not actually related.
They're a month apart.
They're not from the same litter.
I just refer to them as the twins, brother and sister. Cause they act like it.
And yeah
Fia's sister died
When they were kittens
And that's why I was very determined
To make sure Fia was okay.
And then Bumi
Came from a litter of like six kittens
And they were just like found on the street.
Yeah, it's really
It is really devastating losing a pet. Cause they're like
People are like oh, but if you never had a pet
You don't get it, but like they really are part of the family.
I like cats because
A lot of their stuff is instinctual
And I don't have to train them to do anything
Although it is very impressive that I managed to
Create train Fia and Bumi
I don't know how that works, but
You can create train a cat
Cats are pretty independent
They clean themselves
They groom themselves
Use the bathroom
And what you really gotta do is feed them
And give them toys
In a nice comfy bed
Yeah, and they can be pretty independent
Family have had seven cats
To all the creature
My friend has 20 cats
He thought I was a cat lady
She has 20 cats
And she just got like
Four more
So like 20 are at her parents house
And then she moved out and she got four cats of her own
I'm like girl, you need to stop
Yeah
And they have like
Her and her boyfriend
They're building like a
Like a cat patio
Or a cat room for all the cats
And I'm like, honestly, he's a real one for that
I don't think anybody I meet
Would help me make one of those
I
I mean
He just looks at me up with me
With her big blue eyes
How do they take care of all of them?
I think, uh
I don't know, to be honest
It's really just like, again, staying on top of the litter boxes
And then feeding them
So I'm making sure they have like clean water
And toys
And like brushing
The ones that need to be brushed
I brush Rena a lot more often now
Although she's a short-haired cat
She's been shedding a lot more
Because it's around the summer
And she tends to get hairballs
And Rena also likes to fucking eat my hair when I sleep
Two, four snakes and two leopard geckers
That's really cool
I always wanted a snake
My parents said no
I wanted a ball python
And I also wanted tarantulas
And my mom was like, nope
What about isopods?
And my mom was like, what the fuck is an isopod?
I'm like, it's a really pulley
She's like, you can keep it outside
And I'm like, that doesn't make any sense
She's like, exactly, why would you want one?
Two ball pythons on morphs
My friend had a
Wild type
Ball python in a
Albino corn snake
They're pretty cool
She had to give them away to her
Friend though, when she moved though
Well, actually not her friend
To her, her cousin
Really pulley, they're called isopods
Yeah, they're invertebrates
There's actually a lot of different types of them
My favorite is the ducky isopod
They look like little ducks
Do you do out yellow pythons?
Like a Burmese python?
They're kind of
I think Burmese pythons
Are very gorgeous
But they're very invasive
Especially in Florida
People just release them
So they've really kind of ruined their ecosystem down there
All the snakes and cats don't get along
Yeah, my friend also
Had gotten cats too
So that's another reason
Actually, they would kind of just sit and watch the snake
But then at some point
They just knew it was better
You don't want to stress out the snake
You be such a big girl
Thank you
I'm a bug girl, yeah
Hog noses are so cute
I remember me and my dad
Begging my mom to get a hog nose
I can't remember what my dad wanted to name it
Like Miss Piggy or something
One's a pie ball, then that's a pastel champagne lesser
Ooh, pretty
I remember I wanted a pie ball so bad
And keeping
And keeping is cool
Occasionally that like one
What's that guy's name
He like does a lot of
He has this whole like bioactive enclosure
And he releases like a lot of ants and bugs in it
And it's so cool
Like ants are very interesting
I used to like ants
It was weird
My mom said that
We had in our
Like our little like don't be apartment
But um
We lived in
We had like an ant problem
And so my mom like hired an exterminator
And like was getting a lot of traps and stuff
And I was
My mom said that I was um
Trying to take the ants outside
And I was saying
Little ant turn away
Go back to your family
My mom is gonna kill you
You gotta go
And I was like trying to save the ants
I watched one of my um
Favorite channels
They don't really upload as much anymore
Was um
Uh
Something flower horn
Something the flower horn
That was a cool and it was like
They always played like classical music
And I would just like watch and they like
Had a lot of beta fish
But then like I was like
No my mom
Then my dad told me that
I would take magnifying glasses
And set ants on fire
So I like was nice and then I would try to kill ants
And you know like
Out some part of the year
Like a lot of ants will rise
Come out of the ground
Sometimes when after like it rains or something
And there's like a just a giant
Riving mass of them
Food the flower horn
Yes food the flower horn so good
I love that channel
I was allowing them to have full sense of security
So because
We didn't want ant problems
Me and my dad are gonna sound like fucking psychopaths
We would just dump
Rubbing alcohol
On the
Giant ant mess
And then we would set them on fire
And it smelled like bacon
Kind of fucked
But
I don't do that
It's really just to fight the ant problem
I need citizen gasoline
So yeah I've seen that
We have
Because my mom has like a really
She has a garden because that's her thing
She loves gardening
That's why she says she wants to hijack my channel
So she can garden
She's like there's a gardening niche
In redacted
Area that needs to be filled
It's my time like mom no
She being a cheep
And
So they had to I think they had to get rid of
Boss that way
Because they also we have like a
Really old shed that like the bees just like to hang out in this
There's some
Yellow jackets that I
Are under my balcony
And I still haven't
Figured out how my lower neighbors hasn't
Seen their nest yet because every summer
Like I used to let
Rain out on my balcony
Had not the other cats because I know
They will just fucking kamikaze themselves off
I also had like a border around
So that they couldn't like put their head through the bars
Just in case they did get out if I opened it
And um
Fucking excuse you neighbor
Coughing super fucking wildly as they walk by
And um I remember
There was like a bunch of wasps that like
Early yellow jackets or whatever
That were like right near where I would sit
I just crashed fucking coughing up a lung dude
And um
I like ran
To bring Raina inside
Because I didn't want her getting stung
Although cats look kind of funny when they are stung by a bee
Because they are like little doofy faces
Because it sucks
But it's funny at the same time
I didn't want that to happen to her
Normal fish have fairly high maintenance
But betas are real chance
Yeah betas like survive on fucking anything
It's crazy
Fish enthusiasts
And one of them likes to raise shrimp
Um
Like aquascaping seemed really cool to me
But I just I don't have the patience
To maintain stuff
Gardening Shibi's mommy somewhere
No
I've seen so many brutal ant
Wasps nest instructions
Bids, yeah
Drop, yeah I've seen people
I've actually seen the aluminum stuff before
People pouring aluminum into the
Into the nests
And then thinking it out
It's very interesting
Well if I
The model if I like cover my face
I'll fall asleep
I lose tracking
So I usually before I know I'm gonna lose tracking
I try to close my eyes
So I look like I'm sleeping
I see does it automatically but mine doesn't
I have to like be like
And then move myself to the side
It's like sleeping face
I know it is kind of weird
To think about the aluminum ones
I like to watch this channel called snake discovery
I learned a lot from them
I like during
Covid and lockdown and stuff
I just watched, I consumed a lot of
Animal facts stuff
So like I learned a lot about snakes
I'm 100% sure
If somebody handed me a clutch of bottle python eggs
I could raise them no problem
And like invertebrates and
Reptiles
And it was really cool
Yeah snake discovery is awesome
Really awesome
Like if um
If they ever do like
If I ever become big and they do a charity event
I will 100% like donate to them
Cause that would just be cool
And uh yeah
I watched fool the flower horn
Snake discovery
Ants Canada
Dark Den
There was another one I used to watch
But I don't think they posted it anymore
I don't remember
They also had like a lot of
Ranchos
Yeah I was just
Catching up on
Like
I was watching an Ants Canada video
Where he released like a huntsman
And her baby is into an enclosure
And I was like I was just fucking sick
Cause I hadn't like consumed like bug media
In a long time
I really like bugs
Bugs are cool
And animals in general
I like watching um animal documentaries
And also like
A comfort thing that I do cause
Soleil would sit and watch
Like you know like night on earth
On Netflix
Like Soleil loved to watch that
With me
She loved to watch animal documentaries with me
She used to pay attention to the tv
She just hang out
Beetles are cool
I actually don't know a lot about beetles
I know very little about beetles
I mostly like isopods
And uh spiders
And like um
Praying mantises
My genetic spiral arm case in our huntsman
Yeah those enclosures are crazy
I know a little bit about like long horn beetles
I think the coolest thing I've seen
Um I saw those like beetle tattoo ones
Of this girl who had like
When she closed
Like I don't really know how to explain it
But when it was on her
The side of her knee
When her thigh and her calves were touching
It looked like the beetle was
Closed and then when she would spread
Like um stretch out her leg
And she would like
Stretch out her leg
It looked like the beetle was
Extending its wings and it was like the coolest
Fucking tattoo I've ever seen in my life
I've seen that with like moths and stuff too
People do that
You've seen that tattoo? Yeah
I've also seen um
Yeah roaches like how people raise
Dew beer roaches
It's really cool
I like tattoos a lot, tattoos are really cool
I think it's a beautiful art form
Um
Ladybugs
Ladybirds, do people call them ladybirds?
I know you can order ladybugs on amazon
My mom likes um ladybugs
Was it a single beetle?
Yeah it was
I bet if you could do it if you look like
The beetle knee tattoo I bet you can find it
Like ladybirds or regional thing
Miraculous ladybird
That's a miraculous ladybug
That show is weird
I remember I was like I actually like
Binged watched it for a long time
And then I was like I don't know there was like a weird
Fumi um weird undertone to it
I'm a bit sad I missed a stream to catch the ball
Yeah we're just hanging out
I really play a lot of game
I mostly like yapped
Played some game
Cried
Yapped
Played some game
Yapped
Ate food
Yapped
Same as a totally

Hi welcome welcome to harem
Welcome harem
I need to think of like
So

Yap
They literally have a toy box
And they know they can take some out of their toy box

Fiya usually will go into her toy box
And take some out
I mean it just wards all her toys in her bed
Woomi
Woomi woomi woomi

Woomi
That was an impressive roll
Woomi just somersaulted to get a toy
Woomi
Fiya came out of the
Out of nowhere and Woomi went into that
Like that typical arched cat back
Cause he's such a
He's literally such a menace but he's such a pussy
Like he's scared of everything
Like if I'm
If somebody came in broken
Reina my 14 year old elderly cat

Woomi jumps behind the dryer
Fiya would probably just watch
See how everything plays out
Fiya

Pingly ti judgement, Sky
mom and i'm like this is a period accurate why they're black people my mom was like no no it's not
like it's like they kind of just like modernize it a little bit i'm like okay and i actually ended
up really like in the show because i'm very someone like me and my mom are usually very much
sticklers for wow out of context that sounds really bad guys in half black um i feel like i have
to say that every time i say something i'm gonna it's gonna be funny when i get my when i get
my um am i wrong though when i get my tan toggle anytime i say something problematic
whatever this is being caught out anyways don't worry about it
it's pretty serious there's indian well no no no like the the indian like the
indian royal families were understandable like forget it like it doesn't even matter version's
a great show once i got the premise because i thought they were trying to be true to the time period
like tutors ask because i liked tutors um and like the white princess the white queen
and the past can't wait to get my past toggle um three fours of the whole
fun
oh i thought that was like a three-fifths compromise meme okay it wasn't all right
fuck me then uh anyways um
why i'm sorry you guys are just getting
okay
what why are you what's wrong
can't a girl crack a fucking joke jesus
yeah i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't like her
um i'm just too far gone
hey you got you got me which makes those jokes you got emmy which says does gay jokes
you got everybody else who is politically correct i don't know what to do
i need vods to watch she be she be dumping problems see if i was in a normal agency i would not have survived
uh she's black it's fuck is there so much easier when i had a tan model
although i could actually i could probably just change my skin tone in my um
in my uh meshes for the model i could probably do that actually
i might wait it's probably not going up doing fucking blackface if i do this
fuck it weeble
see look at all these layers that are on my model
these are all fucking layers rgb
she be and like mommy
you're getting very sleepy riveling won't you
you want to worship she be like the dog you are
where's my face
it's hard to
we're getting oh god no
no
abort abort
how do i cancel oh my god you can see my neck
oh
abort stop it
no keep going
you know it's funny when i became a streamer my ultimate goal
was to be a role model for other little black girls just like myself who liked video games
and were female and i wanted to be a role model role model for women of color i am not that
i failed myself
i think i just sometimes you just don't you don't it's fun not to take yourself seriously you know
this is really fun to do though i'm just moving my mouse around for this
ah kings are glowing
this is hypnotizing you
keep up the dream yeah it's always been my goal especially because there's like
what i loved about being in this company is that um not only do you have
one black girl that has a black model you have two black girls and one has a white model
um and usually there is no other there's no other company that has a tan or a racial
ambiguous model or black model and i think that's pretty cool that we're kind of branching out
because people are like oh people won't like a tan model look at fucking koinako or waifu baby
like giaru or tan or whatever like it's still a popular niche yeah before serena
rest in peace um avi cadavera she was a fucking amazing creator and it's really sad
to see her go by the way uh amazing comedian and sketch artists she was very very unique
and um vtuber sphere it's i'm congrats to her though for landing some sort of thing
woomi what are you doing i'm gonna give you a hug come here big man kiss you how are you doing
how are you doing mr titties
um yeah sanas sanas.com sana sana i can never pronounce my name right
but uh yeah i feel like azura and serena feel those niches and i feel like it just shows
that there can be there's plenty in the indie sphere let's bring it more into the corporal sphere
you know yeah abby's graduating serena staying this sucks because there's only two of them in their
gen and now serena's alone so i kind of hope they do like for v4 mariah like in some sort of
invader gen um just so like she doesn't have to feel like she's alone
yeah i'm i'm eventually getting like i know emmy um can rig i know she said she
just like like um she i can just hand over the model files to her and she'll just
like slap toggle on so i might just do that although i think um i think um strani is talking to
our um rig papa mama because she's a girl nori um about getting me a cover-up official cover-up
for my biddies in a tan toggle
not that i don't like like you know this model and i would just i'd be like i kind of i want to i
would pull like an iron mouse and just switch between the two because it kind of makes sense
because i am irish also
yeah i wish like some people who had like um like swimsuit models like had like a tan toggle on them
like that would be really cool depends on the audience so i wasn't forced to retire yeah that's true
it's hard to get to colored models yeah yeah because like um for my model i had before
in my past life i literally mostly use a little one uh my former artist mama uh swal koi
fucking amazing because i was like i was a cute funny vtuber um they did such a fucking good job
and sorry that model will never be seen the model i i was going to do a whole debut but then
i got into a veal or that model will never be seen um but they did such a fucking good job on my model
because um they nailed the skin tone how horny was it
uh it wasn't actually uh because i was i was a cute and funny priestess so i kind of had almost
like a gypsy look to me i don't really know how to explain it um there's there was tommy showing
i don't know um and then i had my nun model that i used a lot and i just like edited the mesh like
how you just saw me almost doing something terrible and i just did that and um i just made it tan
but yeah there isn't it's mostly like i think yeah getting like the coloring right because
sometimes it can be gray or like too orange or red it's it's those different tones in uh tan
colors um that's why i provide i provided as many references as possible with the skin tone that i wanted
all right she's a shark she's spanish yeah i feel like there's also like a lot of spanish
and like it honestly kind of makes sense to me to have more tan models because you have a lot
of spanish fans and you also have a lot of um uh agent fans that are more darker skins because
like not every japanese korean filipino tai vietnamese lai ocean etc etc etc etc is snow white
ending of purple yeah i actually at one point i was tempted to um brand into like when i first started
v2 being just to be like a dark elf and just be like drow colored
that's because i feel like people have it or more easily do that than something else i don't know why
why do my eyes look like weird colors
i feel like one's darker than the other with the whole i think i have the like the light in the
center of my eyes and shade it properly
modernizing the end of it yeah half heart yeah tricksy who
the tricksy yeah i know what you're doing um jarby super tight yeah
um trust fit on the nose yeah
i don't want to um flashbang by turning on my turning off the overlay i have on this
but like
i don't know how to word that
but yeah i just think it's cool and like i also think it's like i was almost like i just
a like i wanted i drew this really cool picture of this um i made a slime based vtuber
um made her an oc of mine can you what the fuck are you guys doing
i can hear you fucking about what's up marina go check it out
marina's walking towards the laundry room she's gonna go investigate
um um what the fuck was i saying oh yeah i was gonna be a this was before like this was
just me when i was going indy for the first time by the way because i didn't like again i didn't
conceptualize or create myself as you see now um and no no no she wouldn't she wouldn't be a model
like she be will be my only only one and only model although i'm i'm begging strony for a slime
girl gen two please hello i will sell this oc so this comes to life so i had an oc her name was
saliva and i called her live saliva saliva and she was a slime girl but she was made of spit
she was like blue colored so she was like spit personified um
um and i was like oh i was good so i was gonna be that
so i'm like hey that would actually be a pretty cool idea for gen two
oh it sounds kind of gross well fuck you
um but then she could like you know make herself not spit like she could like change her
form or whatever the fuck um imagine the smell
the spit part not the slime girl the spit part um i thought it was just really on theme
and uh yeah i want i want i want a monster girl i want a bug girl i want a slime girl
i want like out of the box stuff
bio hazard vtuber 100 percent i want i want a slime girl but she's like made out of blood
like i like yeah just be sick is that a is that a what is that is that pig nose pig v2 i don't
has is there a pig vtuber i don't think of it a girl made out of mud
menstruations okay see i didn't go there robot girl oh yeah i want a robot girl i want an android girl
snake girl yeah oh like a like a oh from monster misoom like uh like a lamia
lamia lamia can i pronounce that what led you to joining vealer um i was a huge fan of strawnee
for all her iterations um i watched her grow as a vtuber and when she had other things go on
and she mentioned hey i want to do my own um company i was like oh that'd be sick
so i worked really hard because i um i really only
like i i'd streamed it as a flushtuber in the past and i do have content creation um history
and experience but i was never a vtuber so i'm like if i work really hard i'm gonna stream
i'm gonna get a model like just got one right off at etsy change the colors of it um gonna make
content gonna do my own thing and i'm gonna if when she ever makes this company i want to apply
and because mean i and she'll say the same thing about me because she's called me her 2.0
i saw a lot of shared values in her she was like we have a lot of similar tastes
as you can see we like to stream for very long times and we just like to talk and
yep and hang out with people and we like um as you said like a lot of the same things
and uh it was it was just like what like it's i know like it was the type of
relationship like watching a uh a content creator i hadn't felt in a long time where i'm like
oh i'm gonna watch you and i feel like i'm just hanging out with a friend
and i'm like i want to be that person so bad where you just come home and you're like oh my friend
streaming i'm like we're gonna hang out we're gonna chat we're gonna talk simping paid off um
and like just seeing her like roadmap and what she wanted to accomplish i was like i want to do
everything in my power to try to be in this company um i i honestly don't know how i ended up here
it literally i was bawling my eyes out when i got accepted it was it was it was crazy it was
genuinely wild um but it's but like i'll be honest with you i did apply to other companies
because i didn't think i would get in i also applied for the experience um because i didn't
know what it was like applying to a vtuber agency um yeah i was i was a i was an og refling
some of you already know that um i ended up here because you're awesome oh thank you um
and then you blackmailed her yes and then i blackmailed her so i got her um
um i think yeah she said she so she made notes on our interviews of like why she
oh my internet's starting to go because it's getting late uh they're like shut up we're taking
away your internet so she said i got to see some notes of what she wrote down about me during
her interview and when she took when she was like doing research on the people that applied and
she wrote down i'm way too knowledgeable about the industry for only being around for six months
which is true although it's been um more than six months now that i've been a vtuber
and uh i was very good at voice acting and at a range but i needed to work on my cute and funny
voice is what she said because i mostly streamed it was like cute and funny but i had a lot of
vocal fry when i did my cute and funny voice but now i don't not now it's um i've trained it since
then and um and she saw again like a lot of herself in me and i think she said that i wonder
if i can find it she said that you know i was what she should have been in another life and i was like
and i i disagreed with her on that how long i've been so i've been a streamer for almost like for
about five years i had to take a break because of school and work and then i got back into vtubers
again and i um yes i was like when she told like when when i asked the manager for the notes
because i'm like okay how can i improve and i saw that i literally broke down crying
um so it was i was blown away by that fucking um statement and i it is my goal to live up to it now
did you try any other kind of voice acting besides stream uh actually no i don't have
any other voice acting under my belt i only did it for fun in my streams i was always good at
doing wacky voices when i hung out with my friends i was that the funny one in the friend group
the girl who managed to have a sense of humor um
then you said the acceptance note it's april first yes and then two days later i think i i
interviewed the strawney she was like you're in like excuse me she's like yeah uh here's the model
slide shebe's first um model iteration because we did like had some adjustment since then
like i had i used to have a lipstick then i pointed out that i'm like i had like the same
lips as a zura so they yoinked my lipstick away um i can't wait to be picked up a cruncher
although it would be it would literally it would be so crazy if i got to voice for an anime
that is like oh my god that'd be so insane that'd be so amazing queen must my emergency
oh queen uh so um some of you know like i wasn't uh technically supposed to be shebe it was supposed
to be another um asa mark creator uh but life uh commitment's gone the way so she couldn't sign on
so uh she goes dub stories dub that'd be so fucking funny i don't love you because you're a rabbit
i don't love you because you're wow why am i i am so fucking bad today what the fuck dude
um anime series voice acting i don't really particular series does anything fantasy related
i'm never gonna be hired at this rate um
i think i use that sort of humor as a coping mechanism or like a defense mechanism because
younger me would just ball her eyes out if somebody said that to me and i think i've just adapted
um yeah oh yeah so uh thank you for reminding me so yeah i wasn't supposed to be shebe um
but but shebe wasn't shebe back then because the other asa martis and strani were conceptualizing
the og shebe together and then other asa martis could not sign on because um and this is like way
early in development like before buehler had a fucking like name um and so then you know strani was
on the hunt for a different creator and i just happened to fit that and but it's she's always
reassured me she's like you're always gonna be my sheepsters like you're always my shivers
you're always gonna be my she my sheepsters um yeah when it was still a b sucky yeah um but yeah
she i originally had like i was i was as thick as a zura and i was purple i was purple
um and then yeah then they changed it and worked through the conceptualization and then
i'm like i hired on and it's me and i'm a bunny yeah i was barney your voice seriously suits shebe to a
i don't think my voice suits it at all i i'll be on it like when i first got my model
and i was watching myself talk out of it it was very weird and it still is weird to me
so you were out only yes oh my god out only such a fucking great game um yeah i never like i'm
still getting used to hearing my honestly i think my normal speaking voice fits better
but some i use like my patreon voice when i get really like like i don't like my like my voice
in the trailer and in my um like one of my shorts i'm like my i like really deep in my voice
and i really put my voice on and it's like they always say like you always put on a voice
when you first stream and then you either get higher or you lower your voice like a lot of girls
mostly pitch their voices up because they want to be cute and they want to talk like this
and then they'll be like hey what's up like later like a couple months down the line
um you went musky deep hefty hefty hefty uh i think you lost us on that one
well i mean a large white guy for some of my voice talk of a giant bird
yeah exactly like it's it's uh i've also was so used to seeing my voice come out
of my pl that i think that was like if if i had not started v2 being they just gave me this model
i think it would have been way so pl means past life um and i yeah i don't think i would have had the
problem but because i was cute and funny in tan and then being this i was like huh
um one of my favorite things about being trans is still having a deep voice i can slip into
one of my uh one of my gorex is is trans and she always pulls that on me
because and it throws me off each time because she'll come up to me behind me at work
and she'll be like hey excuse me and i'll be like what the f**k if then it's her and i'm like
f**k you and she's like hey sorry skat skadaddles away i'm like b**ch um
yeah pl past life
my mom nice to go yeah like oh when i saw the model when strawnee showed me the model i was like holy s**t
i'm a hot as f**k like holy and you want me to be that also why is she wearing so many
bonnage ropes i also um i might ask nari to get a toggle where i can take off the ropes
they're starting to chafe none the good way but i can like i want to be able to toggle them in my uh
gag just for like um content reasons because i feel like i honestly i i personally out of all the girls
don't think i'll get monetization because of my model because i'm wearing a ballgag
i don't know and then azura has really big boos who knows silk rope not have yeah
what lore yeah i know um it's funny when i became a vtuber i was like you know what i
want to do definitely i really want to stick to a character like i really just want to role play a
character and i'm like then streaming yeah my cute my really cute necklace my cute choker it's
very unique then streaming i realized i just somebody had said about me that they wish i would
be myself and then when i started being myself i had the most fun and when i started being myself
i made better content and i think that's why people have a hard time sticking to cave ape because
they realize when they're you're already kind of hiding yourself behind you know an anime character
on the internet like why can't you be yourself but also have aspects of that character you really
enjoy like um for this i do like learning how about how to be a dom and you know i like pretending
and role playing that like you're my either my clients or my staff at waterland hotel like that's
just so fun to me like oh did you uh go make sure that mr withamall was taking care of
him he needs his dick suck now
and he also needs his his bed made in his his clothing pressed um and and i think you know people
do complain sometimes like oh cave ape cave ape cave ape that's taking a cave ape
but then you look at the most popular vtubers and you see that people fell in love with them
because they were themselves you know like like gir for example she was always like you know really
cute in childlike like she like that sort of silly um person like personality you know if she
she's not gonna really lean into being a shark and being like i want to kill everybody or whatever
like she like yeah cave ape is a wrestling term it means like um kind of like your role
like with the act that you put on your your lore aka your story your backstory um because that's her
exactly it's her she didn't have to put any like and that's why at first i was frustrated when applying
to companies because i was like oh why are they like why am i not getting hired and then
and then watching like places i applied for because like i applied to idol i applied to pixel link i applied
to um like vnu and all that stuff and then i see the people who play and um are those vtubers
and i'm like i don't i do not see myself as that bird like i would not want to have hired anyone
else besides the person playing this um this character like not even because they they always
say oh they're looking for people to fit the character they're looking for people to fit the
role fit the voice and i totally get it now because after applying for so much and then getting
um shot down i was like i just didn't fit them and i and i see myself not fitting them
and i couldn't see myself growing into that character so it's really cool to kind of see
what people get cast as and how like their true personalities come out like i'm getting i remember
i watched a lot of vnu girls before i was um hired and i like um like mesmerizing i was i was um
chatting with her the other day in her in her stream and i'm like i could not see myself playing it
like you're also kind of like a mommy character but you're also like classy you know about drinks
like she's very like like she's so like i don't know like it's just it's just like everybody fits
so perfectly you know agencies are picky and also you know there's like nepotism and
shit like i didn't think i was gonna get into veal or because i didn't know if strani was going
to go the route of like hiring friends or hiring people that because you know it is it's more
smarter to hire people that already have a history and experience of being in a corporate agency
but she took a chance on me and i appreciate her for that dom the role i was born to play
oh that's funny no i like i like um i like switching and putting you guys like i'll be
like hey i'm a dark girl failure then i'm like open your mouth say ah okay hold it and i just
rule into your fucking mouth now swallow good boy like i like it's fun just like pulling it out of
nowhere he's a bishop principal is there reading material how to dom i mean i watch a lot of
fucking porn to learn and uh you guys have already also given me suggestions of stuff to watch
and i also learned i did i watch a lot of youtube videos about the culture of like um like bdsm culture
um like i know somebody was kind of frustrated with me at first because i made a joke that i didn't
believe in safe words yes i believe in like safe words are very important they're important with
consent and all that stuff um sometimes i like to be a bit and sometimes people are into that
sometimes people like so i will cater to different niches and fetishes and all that other stuff calm down
i'm not gonna hurt anybody i'm not actually in the bdsm community promoting like
abuse
good for homework yeah and it's like uh it's funny because looking at the girls i don't
like we would see people guessing about who was gonna play who like people thought i was gonna
be icy or someone or whatever the fuck um just because i was cute and funny in another life
another reincarnation reincarnation and i don't see like i don't see myself as like even loving
playing a cute funny character i don't see myself like they everybody was casted so perfectly
and people thought i was gonna be icy or emmy because i was cute funny
and i i i was very um yandere masochistic type
i've got a dmg manager yeah yeah i did it twice my manager was like what the fuck
i'm like yeah what the hell
yeah it's like yeah i'm like bro just walk away from the computer close your eyes
turn off the computer and walk away like we're we're here to have fun we're gonna be silly
i might say some stuff that's inflammatory but it's jokes
i'm still cute yeah i do have my cute and funny moments
yeah we're gonna get told me
sorry i'm reading something that i didn't in the context of
um
but yeah no i i read a lot about so rgb rgb rgb rgb rgb i um
i'm right up on a lot of stuff uh you guys also gave me some advice which is actually
very helpful i did read it even if i didn't respond to you um i always read all the maros even
if i don't respond um usually because i don't respond because i want to give the same energy
back or i don't know what to say to be honest although i can yeah sometimes i don't know how to
talk over text um
real shibi better than pretend shibi um and i think i think people like it's been like because
you i totally get it you have these expectations of a streamer because that's how they're marketed um
and but then you have to realize that they're not going to be able to play the character all the time
and if they can't impress it but yeah everybody everybody that was hired in my gen they all are
it's just like so much like their characters in ways you know
you
all right no i like i always had respect like i'm i'm not someone who is like uh
bsm oh like i always had respect for different niches and um
different uh communities like that like um like sometimes i'll find something silly like pony play
or like uh leather puppies or whatever the fuck like those are funny um and that's just not my thing
i'm not gonna go and like outwardly just like go up to someone who i know is into that to be like
you're fucking stupid like i don't i don't have the energy for that stuff you've been the best
cap most surprised ever but then like i said the nice surprise you i turn it on i get real
up close and personal and i tell you how it is sweetheart
have you been behaving all so good
you do me a favor any good on your knees
i'll put madam stockings in your mouth okay i need you to be crying
um
fuckles is that a new emoji i've no thing i've seen a kneeling emoji before
like for me first yeah the algorithm works in mysterious ways um
i actually got on my knees help um
um
strani said to all of us she wanted us to be ourselves because ourselves were how she saw
the characters and i couldn't agree with her more and if you disagree with that you're totally
entitled to that opinion um but i feel like people have really started to appreciate our
personalities over the last week and it makes me happy like it makes me very happy i'm happy
that there's somebody for everybody in this company like sometimes you don't like every girl
or you like one or two but it seems like the consensus is
like you all like us for our different quirks and our different hobbies and our different
skills and talents and it just makes me so happy
and i feel bad because you know people are like oh
feeler is going to be dead on arrival just because you know the type of content we do on the side
and i just i'm so excited to see like the next year when we've proved them wrong and we show that
we're a normal company we just do patreon 18 plus content
that's it like that's the only difference i'm still a normal streamer
swimming around about strani's pale she's always been supportive and encouraging as
content creator yeah like this is the most self-sacrificing woman i've ever met like
just like what she did for some girls one time she's like collab with me i'm gonna give you the
the the money for it because you've been screwed because of your past cut like that just
like why wouldn't i want to work for someone who's like that you know
why wouldn't i want to work with the other girls who their previous content shows
positive character their silliness their talents
i like you guys because you guys are way more mellow than other creators i know delman
yeah you know what's a bummer is you know as an agency
vtuber you do have to be a little bit you know more corporate professional
and i will i'll be like that sometimes i have my moments where i'm like that because i want
i truly want this company be great i i said to myself have i managed to get into
velar i will do everything in my power to make it great and succeed because i know if we do
you will set different precedents for deep vtuber agencies showing that you can still treat your
talents as human beings you can pay them well you can still make a profit you can invest in the right spots
um and you can branch out to other platforms safely and you can allow 18 plus content in
monitor and manage it safely and there's a way like there's a lot of things in place that
our management team do so that we have peace of mind so that we are have good mental health
um yeah i want i want it to be a positive for it because a lot of people say we're not going to be
we're like uh i've seen like even this before i was joined this is before i applied um like watching
like the drama channels or whatever or people talking about it people are like oh they're
going to be dead on arrival oh they're sketchy it's a scam it's this that it is it just bums me out
just because of what happened in strice past you're going to damn the people that are going
to be in the company in the future um it's a bummer i know we're going to miss out on a lot of
opportunities before that for because of that but i don't give a shit because i'm going to
fucking show everybody we're going to be fucking amazing i've been waiting for false to make a video
and you guys will be probably they're probably not going to and i actually don't mind it because
we don't give a kind of attention we don't get haters so when we see 18 plus content you will
never see my flesh in 18 plus content i will say that right now you will never see i'm not going to
be fucking finger blasting myself my rtx form i will only be doing um patreon like and i'm sorry if
you were expecting that i'm not going to be doing that i don't feel comfortable doing that um i will be
doing uh loot audio and that is on my patreon in my description and i will probably be um doing like
3d stuff like project melody style or uh playing like iregames um i want to learn
poll so i can do 3d dancing and stuff because that'd be really fucking cool i feel like that'd
be good like work out yeah i'm already kind of broken
i'm reading up
i feel like a lot of people in this news especially if you drop the act because
like more natural probably because of the company and people back into the fan
yeah don't knock it till you try it i always say give something jujitsu on stream that'd be funny
um haven't done jujitsu in a bit though so
um i forgot what i was gonna say but yeah yeah i can't wait to do hoonipop
we want to establish ourselves on other platforms first before we kind of branch out um
starting to explain it into her like exposing vealer thing that she wants us yet to be established
on the main platforms it's because you know you'll be more successful she knows the algorithm
she's working the industry for a while and then you'll branch out to other ones once we've been
you know solidified on youtube and patreon
i mean like want to see what she has to say
uh yeah that's on yeah like i feel like when when false first announced and even like kaiyo
like that other guy um they were covering vealer it was mostly about the negative reaction
and then like there's like a minute of positive because that's just how news and media works
you get more clicks and more views when you cover the negative aspects of stuff so it makes sense
that when you do a report on a company and you really mostly highlight the vocal minority because
a lot of people were actually pretty positive about vealer when i was like to my own uh lurking
people are all gonna assume that oh this is actually the majority so it just it really did
you know it's it's what drives the clicks yeah exactly
great turn on you feels a lot more personal compared to the best of two that makes us yeah
like i i love like i didn't think i would love like i'm uh so people wonder about like my history
with like because i didn't do any sfw stuff on my past life um except my sfw history it was
i don't only fans for like a month and i was like nah i'm fine i was like i needed like some
extra cash real quick and then i um drew uh sfw content and i i haven't ever used i hadn't ever
used a 3d o before um i never recorded super loot content like i would make like jokes and stuff
from like read silly um scripts from like a mars a smart script haven't like read it or whatever
but like i realized i actually like making this content and i love voice acting in this way for
you guys um see yeah it's it's a completely new world for me and i'm realizing i enjoy a lot and
like don't think oh she was corrupted all this or that no i'm an adult woman no one's coercing me into
fucking anything relax um con while i've heard of that i've never been there before
and yeah and it's like i i realized i was good at it the first time i sent a script the like i
filled something for strani she it was just like did you edit this and i'm like no she's like
because i sent this to the editor and they were like all i had to do was to add the effects
and i'm like really she's like fuck yeah that was fucking if she's like if you record like this
it's everything's gonna be a breeze and she's like you've never done this before and i'm like no
she's like what the fuck anyways here's some more scripts and so yeah
and like i'm still learning like i'm still growing as i do voice acting for this stuff
and i feel like you'll notice as i because she gave us scripts like for month like
dune audios for this month july audios for this month august audios september audios blah blah blah
i think you'll notice as i record different months um i do improve and stuff
and we'll be able to donate super chats as always oh no that's okay that's okay that's a good question
um we all just applied for monetization so hopefully soon um i know strani is worried about me
and azura being monetized because of um because of our what we look like with our cake old bitties
halloween's gonna be hectic yeah it'd be cool what should i be for halloween
i don't even like it's but also like i also want you guys to know um when strani sent me a lot of strips
a strips oh uh scripts a lot of the stuff was like office related because my lore is like i work
to an office so a lot of it's like your boss does this and so she for for a couple of months
you're not gonna get any like super i'm sorry like and if you can remove yourself from the
patreon if you want that'll be honest with you you're still gonna enjoy what you hear
trust me um i've heard some of the girls they for some of mine everybody's fucking good
um the heart she wants to do a whole like month for like hard dom for me because it seems
like that's what people want our boss does what your boss catches you doing something that's all i'm
gonna say um yeah my next audio she she's staggering out the audio so you guys technically
get an audio every day if you're subscribed to all of us which is pretty fucking awesome my opinion
so you never like you just be mindless for a week um but yeah it knows i like i feel like i'm a
there are some where i'm like heart like but it's always in the a lot of it is in the environment
of an office that's what i mean it's not like there's not a lot in the environment of like a fucking
sex engine that's like which is what people are expecting big brain scheduling again can't just
be that yeah essentially pretty much um so yeah i feel like because but like there's also cool stuff
like i don't i don't really think i'm it's a it's bad thing to spoil it and she never said we couldn't
like talk about the scripts you felt but like i'm also like your roommate in one of them i'm also
your um classmate i'm also like someone you just match with until like it's so it's a lot of cool
different scenarios um i'm dom and generally the majority of them um literally of course the
first one you guys vote to listen to was my literally my one sub audio i recorded out of
like 27 well i don't think it was that much but it was just funny uh and first yeah
i know and then i was just like and so it tied with uh with a different one that was me dom
and i'm like strani please pick the one that's dom or they're gonna be like what the fuck is this
this is not what we signed up for she's like oh i already uploaded the other one and i'm like god damn it
any of them considers rich uh i don't really know you guys will have to tell me to be honest
or like um tell strani cuz strani is the one who puts the tags in
yeah i know i'd not like even when i before i read the script like i read the title i was like oh
this is what's gonna happen i'm like that's not what happened like it was it's i love reading the
scripts before i like um read them out you're like record them because then i just get like really
surprised and i'm like oh man oh whoa oh gosh um but yeah so like this like we're all gonna be
doing a variety of content and roles situation it's really fun um i also like i want to do
cuz i really like asmr role plays like i like just reading scripts and doing like guided
meditations and like sleep aids and stuff so i'm gonna have a lot of that on my channel um just
like safer work stuff i think strani is having someone edit my um one of my safer work audios
and we're waiting for monetization for her to and then she's gonna put it it's like a
i'm so excited for it i worked really hard on it so i hope it comes out good
um yeah like uh i think guided meditation would be really cool
you read watershed down in fifth grade yes i did
cuz i was weird and i like warrior cats and watershed down is actually very similar to warrior
cats i'm entire playlist asmr so you know how i've been watching lately and this is
they're one of my favorite um asmr this lately i don't know if you guys know who king hobbit is
but she's the cutest uh girl i think she's from the uk and um and it's like she's just like
so fucking goofy and she's all over the place and she has the cutest like accent uh i highly
recommend you watching king hobbit she's so adorable i definitely wish i could make content
like i want to learn how to make like um content or i can kind of like smack my head
on over my rtx face and do like visual triggers you know like i'm like wave my hands in your face
and shit because i feel like like the lag with a 3d model oh you know or maybe i could try
with 3d model um i know there's some vtubers that do that but if i could like motion track
my models head over my body i think that would be and do like visual triggers i think that'd be
really fun yeah exactly like how onigiri does it with her cooking like i would love to do that with
asmr and i've seen like there was one creator i saw that actually was doing it for like music
related stuff i think he was like playing a ukulele he's like a really goofy looking um really cool
stylized um almost looks like something from like cyberspace what was that gay what was that tv show
cyber kids i don't know looks like something out of that and i was like oh that'd be sick to apply
to asmr and there's also somebody who did that something similar before that um tv ties you
have asmr reply there's actually something like that i don't like android no not cyberpunk
cyberchase thank you cyberchase spy kids great oh yes spy kids game over
i can love those movies yes cyberchase like he's he's like a cyberchase stylized
um vtuber vtuber model and i think they rigged and drew it themselves but they yeah they
uh they motion tracked their models head over their body but you could see like their hands and he would
play guitar or ukulele i was like oh my gosh imagine this applied in like asmr sense
and i feel like it would be easier for monetization because um you like
like when a human if a human gets to review a video um they would see that no i'm not doing
something inappropriate i'm just like doing a trigger and with like because a lot of times um
like people do like ear oil stuff and they're like oh it's sucking pee pee
yeah the only the three original movies 100%
be locally accurate asmr yeah i can't wait to go i think i might go to like a craft store and um
get some stuff for the like like a michael's or something or joined fabrics and get some
stuff for the asmr stream that's me
a human i know right and i'll like or at least like maybe with bots like they would be like oh there's
a person in this but they have a cartoon head that's fine i don't know because like asmr is being
really cracked down on lately on um youtube no matter what type of creator you are whether you're
flash or vtuber so it's kind of a bummer like any like like recent um asmr content old stuff
hasn't been flagged by bots but new stuff that's being uploaded gets um gets pretty
shadow on which sucks
can't wait for the learner to probably tie shabarovs i know i need to get like shabarovs
so i can learn that time i don't i don't know what the f**k up so bad you guys are gonna laugh at me
oh i think mercy is streaming now so if you guys um want to hang out with mercy i understand
the rumors i'm just gapping we're just talking about industry stuff maybe alert stuff
like some big yaptos of course yeah yeah of course
magic ram harness to start i've seen what those look like i was thinking about um tying my legs
because i was watching somebody tie their legs and i'm like oh that'd be cool because then i can just
do like like i can just like angle my camera on my desk i think properly and just like tie my legs
i don't know and both tracks yeah like that's what i love i like i i so what i have um one friend
that's a former corporal vtuber and she was worried about me because she's like in my company
i experienced a lot of like jealousy and competitiveness between the girls but what i love about
my company personally me saying this i love the other girls and i just want them and like
none of us are like jealous or catty or whatever like we generally just want each other to
um succeed and we talk every day and then like so that's why we'll always be like hey this person
is streaming oh however you like like we'll just like direct you to other everybody's everybody
else's chats because we just we just want you to have fun you know not about us about you
what you enjoy we want to make sure everybody shares the love
damn i should be like way more bitchy so so much of dorm that i am i'm being too wholesome right
now fuck me rena why are you staring at me like that god damn why you posted up you're trying to fight
what you've been doing big mama
hmm
she's like staring me down from her cat tree
her face is so funny she's like she's a little cross-eyed right now
because she uses his focus her eyes and what are you doing are you gonna come over here
you're looking at me like you want to hang out did you want to snuggle
i'm down for a snuggle if you're down for a snuggle
you can dominate me bet yeah i know
dorms can't be wholesome yeah dorms come someone said in my mirrors and all shapes and sizes
and i'm like you're right bro you're right i can still choke you and hang you from some
shabari ropes from my ceiling and knocking around like a pinata and then you know give
you a smooch afterwards untie you and you like a like a kinder egg and say how much of a good boy
or girl you are yes again it makes it thank you
i went up kinder egg in a while i discovered i really like those bueno bars i was like
i like got i went to all these um because they have all these they like open in all these
and i'm like oh yo i'm poor let me no not that poor people shop at all these it's just
a lot more affordable that's all i'm saying because i'm broke and i'm like okay let me uh
let me go to all these and they had buenoes at the checkout counter and i had one in my life
changed forever yes they do slap because i really like nutella pinata roleplay oh that's actually
maybe maybe i'll do that as a freebie
i like adding my own sound effects to stuff like when i did like the one of my all of you
being in a cage in like me having breakfast i literally i literally had placed my phone
in my cat's crate opened the door took my phone out walked all the way to my closet and then recorded
the rest that's funny yeah they do they really do i got like a nice like um uh like
beef round beef no was it a beef no i made like a really good beef stew from this beef that i got
and i also got like a giant ass salmon now i was like jiggles tits excitedly
it'd be so much more colorful yeah what sucks is like i i genuinely don't know how
i'm gonna do like i need to figure like ever corded me cooking and baking before but it was
hard and i had to use another laptop i don't know if i'll have that laptop much much longer
because it's a company laptop and if i leave this company they're gonna yoink it for me maybe i don't
know um so who knows i was supposed to give it back a year ago but they haven't they haven't
asked for it back yet so they're like you'll be you'll expect the the uh the boxes to return
from when i worked from home the boxes to return died nice how am i gonna let me out
i got a 5k display just chilling and a computer
and i'm like please don't ask from the back because i can sell that display or i can use it
yeah i definitely choked on a kinder egg when i was a kid
did i or was it something else i don't know i put a lot of stuff in my mouth as a kid
that sounded so fucked up i meant like toys i like to chew on things
but xlossin should be not true no but the thing is like they um
they remote manage it so well the the the display i could probably keep but the the
laptop they remote manage
i remember i swallowed a quarter when i was a kid and i had to poop it out
or it might still be in my system i don't know
i literally just remembered that right now holy shit that i swallowed a quarter
my mom was so frustrated with me i have to ask my mom about that i was like oh yeah
i didn't swallow it what the fuck i did swallow weird stuff
what what the cookie put what the fuck is that
i was i'm tempted to like jailbreak it i really am
it's been seven hours holy shit bro hi well a bunch of us is gonna get chopped i'm probably gonna
right now are you gonna jump there we go um i'm probably gonna cut from when i
came back crying and shit um and what else and then probably rena is rubbing against my
microphone lady um and i'll probably keep in when i got my food and when
i got to the house we're not keeping that listen i was trying to make my model more
accurate to my skin tone i was trying to find it and i should have done it off stream because
it just looked bad against this mall
yeah i'm gonna when i went on brb i'm gonna cut out when i came back
but like i'll probably keep in like the stuff about like what i'm talking about now
i realized it takes a long time for youtube to process stuff like so i'm i'm probably
oh my god i'm here with my nose i might private this for um and then edit it tomorrow and then
let it come back to life
oh yeah no you'll definitely mistrani apologized to me like every every other day she's like
i'm so sorry i washed you i'm like it's fucking fine relax it's not that big of a deal
you know why are you looking at me like that
i'm random you got like hair on my nose now my nose is a G i love you so much though
you're being cold like legit being cold because i think i got cold earlier
um i had
i think i had like 4.5 i have 4.3 i don't know
it's not exactly like what
i'm confused
i'm passive oh yeah if he is a fucking adorable she's so cute i was gonna upload a video for today
with her little toe beans out am i still do that but then like i really like my hands were
fucking gross because i was cleaning stuff and i'm like ew i'm not posting that because my nails
look grimy as shit people be like what the fuck is this bitch doing
cleaning dishes that's what
i did not just sound exactly like her that was like not even remotely close
i gave her like a British accent maybe you live like this
sorry again i have a short-term memory loss and never get what i'm talking about half the time
less and more don't clean it i live a dishwasher why am i cleaning my own dishes you're my dishwasher
get over here
get to cleaning
yeah so yeah
my mom calls it fibro fog because you just kind of like forget because my mom is fibro and i have fibro
well my fibro is actually been finitely i haven't been stressed so i haven't been having flare-ups and my
bodies feel okay my arm kind of hurts i've had like maybe like one migraine i'm actually doing okay
i think because i'm happy that i'm streaming again it was hard being away from streaming for so long
i was only like dying
yeah and like i'm a little stressed because like my fucking you know my dad and now my
my landlord and all that but you know i just i have faith that everything will be okay
we're together we're good i got you guys i got my girls i got my management team
i got my parents i got my therapist i got my friends i will be a okay and that's what i
always have to remind myself
sometimes i tend to be like kind of a doomer and just like really get really down and
i've been trying to practice on not doing that then it only just makes me have a flare-up
and i'm just like can't fucking move yeah
yeah
and my dad has um diabetes genetic though not like um health like diet related i forget is it
like i was gonna type one and type two confused but it doesn't even matter because he actually
technically has both he has like that weird rare one where it's like the he needs he can manage it
with his diet but he like he still has an insulin pump um i will actually which really sucks i'll
probably end up being diabetic too because genetically um all the women in my family have it
so i'm more like so i try to eat right um i try to you know stay on top of my a1c
i know there's like another a couple of other v2 births that have diabetes
and like i'm my dad has educated me a lot on stuff and i'm not like scared of needles or
anything if i had to do that so yeah i'm very like my my dad's like very hard on me because he
doesn't want me to get it but it's very much a possibility all of my other members my dad's
side have gotten it like literally before the age of 35
and i'm 56 so you never know
oh my homies hate genetic predispositions i always like to tease my parents i'm like you guys just
had to have a kid and sit off this genetic bomb of all these fucking issues that i get to
do stupid genes like a rid of all mine i don't wear denim anymore
fuck denim um but yeah i'm on top of it and i like i know like i've encouraged some
of you guys to be healthy from what you guys have said in my marrows with like um with my
asthma and stuff that i was like telling people to um you know tell tell like five good things about
them and like try to eat better and work out that's actually motivated me back that like you guys
are like yeah i'm trying to work on myself and i'm like you know what i'm working on myself too
we're all here working on ourselves
we're improving because you know my mom always told me that um
what is it a relationship you always want to grow from a relationship
you always want to grow into another person no matter what the relationship is you know
are you feeling it no i didn't sleep last night i think i probably fucked up my sleep schedule
because i'm actually okay right now i also had like a really big coffee
in the middle of the day
i'm girl feeling again
now that you mentioned it actually i'm getting like a little eepy
i just don't want to stop talking to you guys oh i feel so fucking cringe when i say that
i hate it so much i'm sorry
do you have like teardrops what do you mean
it's highlighted on my model my eyes
no i don't like i don't like you baka what are you talking about i don't like you
i don't know what kind of like you you're stinky
who could like someone like you
not me that's for sure
you're gonna call me a stinker fuck you mods take them out
was i talking like her they actually like her i know i accidentally did like
doki birds exact voice one time i didn't even mean to because she has like a
she has like a little bit this is me analyzing her voice patterns not like insulting or anything
she has like a little bit of like a nasal thing and when she laughs i can't i have to listen to her
right now but again but i realized i could i could do her voice pretty well and like it does
have the and she has like a little bit of a cry but it's very very subtle
involve the doki laugh if i could actually i can listen to it and i can probably do it
i can turn my headphone back on
playing death mark
but mark she's playing i don't know what that is but it looks cool
uh doki bird laugh
so
she has a kudos laugh
laugh

Have you ever watched the goonies?
Of course, I fucking love the goonies.
Sorry, I'm eating food again.
A little midnight snacky.
A little midnight snacky poo.
What are you eating?
I'm eating fuck.
I got it earlier.
I just flipped my spoon and it was really cool.
I don't know.
I just don't feel like...
I need to learn more.
I just listen and I mimic.
That's all I do.
I'm not trained or whatever.
My model looks so funny when I eat.
I'm really having...
I'm really having a bad time.
I'm having a bad time.
I'm having a bad time.
I'm having a bad time.
I'm having a really bad fucking cramps.
I think it's my tummy though.
I don't even know how I would train.
How the fuck? It's cold.
But it's okay.
Do I have to fart real bad or something?
What the fuck is wrong with me?
I never try to do Amelie's voice.
I'm actually better at doing higher voices
than I am voices that are similar
and like deep like a mature as mine.
I don't know.
I only have a bunch of a mommy voice.
Naturally.
I do put on my mommy voice just a little bit.
I don't know what I would do with it.
Go to bed!
You're a good girl, go to bed.
Ow!
Where's my stomach hurt all of a sudden?
Oof!
Yeah!
Ow.
Maybe it was like coffee,

I'll do karaoke, like that'll be fun.
Cause I just don't take karaoke seriously.
Like none of my singing stuff will be a professional.
My cover only sounds okay cause I'm good at like rapping.
And um...
Sorry I'm fine for my life cause I feel like I just got stabbed in the fucking gut.
Rapping, maybe am I getting food poisoning from this shit?
I swear to fucking god this will give me food poisoning.
I hate it here.
Um...
I'm doing, yeah I would definitely rap.
Um...
I really want to learn how to scream.
I've already said that, scream and growl.
I'm in mume's range?
I'll be honest, I don't watch a lot of holo girls because...
They scare me cause they're so talented.
Rap god, she be.
I have done rap god and oh my god I'm not gonna eat the rest of this fuck cause my stomach is fucking killing me now.
Um...
Who do I watch?
I only watch small corpos.
And I watch indies.
And I watch my friends from appeal.
Maybe I need to fart holo.
I'm not sure I can say this.
That did not help.
I don't know who Lauren would be back.
When my use is a higher register most of the time if she stops and breaks the cafe if she goes into a v-boy.
Oh I didn't really know that.
Pia what the fuck are you doing?
Why are you clawing at my chair?
Sometimes she's lazy, sometimes she takes off and helps.
Because she's jumping into my lap.
I hope you've had a good stream.
