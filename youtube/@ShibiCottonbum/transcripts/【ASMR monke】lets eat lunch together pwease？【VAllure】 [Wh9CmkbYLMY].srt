1
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You

2
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You

3
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You

4
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You

5
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You

6
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You

7
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You

8
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Thought it'd be neat

9
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,020
Kind of just wanted to test out the 3DL

10
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:17,360
So I hope that you brought your um your your lunch with you and

11
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,520
Yeah

12
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:27,100
I have a video next to me and Boomi is behind me sleeping in the bed

13
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,980
And I don't

14
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,300
Rain is just staring at

15
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,300
Slicking up at me asking if she can jump up

16
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,060
What are we eating? No, I'm not eating seafood

17
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,980
I'm not eating seafood

18
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,500
I'm not eating seafood

19
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,060
No, that's that's for a different place

20
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:10,500
I see where is it. Oh, this is me on this information

21
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,500
Oh

22
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,060
Oh

23
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,340
You ate your lunch already?

24
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,060
I

25
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:37,300
I hope that's not too distracting

26
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,220
Okay, I'm your lunch

27
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,220
Feel free to role play along

28
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,020
I have some pickles

29
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:08,340
I have some salami and some little bread and I have some cheese

30
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:14,580
And I have some more bread and cheese and eggs and grapes and apples

31
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,620
So we have a little charcuterie

32
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,700
We have a charcuterie. So let me let me um

33
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,420
would you

34
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,700
I think the waiter I already put put in the order for us

35
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,260
So the waiter should be coming over

36
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,820
with the charcuterie

37
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,140
quite quite soon

38
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,300
any moments now

39
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,180
Any moment now? Oh, there it is

40
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:47,140
There it is everyone. Why is it in my lap?

41
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,500
Um

42
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,220
Well

43
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,300
Compliments to the chef

44
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,660
Uh

45
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:07,940
Honestly, I was staring at this picture for the longest time. I don't know if it's AI generated. It just doesn't look real to me

46
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,020
It doesn't look real

47
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:16,820
Um, actually, you know what I'll do. I'll just I'll do something different

48
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,260
Let me let me make it

49
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,460
I

50
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:31,220
How does this sound I didn't mean to throw it at you

51
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,580
I'm sorry

52
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:44,660
There we go now I can place it on the table if you wanted to drink

53
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,740
Um too bad

54
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,740
This is all I got

55
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,140
On the time that I had okay

56
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,740
So I have some pickles

57
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,980
And it's called oh snap pickles

58
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:03,540
And then I have the hill shot. It's like punctual bulls for adults

59
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:08,500
I don't know. Is this expired but neat kind of looks weird

60
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,820
When is the use by date?

61
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,620
I

62
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:24,820
Used by 11 28 24. Okay, we're safe. I think for now and then I got the starbucks eggs and cheddar poaching box

63
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:32,340
I don't know if this is good either, but I'm gonna eat it anyways

64
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,860
But I have a little charcuterie

65
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,900
Let me get a fork

66
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,060
I

67
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,940
Let's try these pickles

68
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,780
You want some ambient restaurant noise, that's a good idea

69
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,540
Hmm

70
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,140
I

71
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,100
Don't

72
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,620
Let's cover the cat hair I can't eat that one

73
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,700
I

74
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:54,660
Have some ice water we reserve this whole place for ourselves

75
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:05,380
I I put a lot of money in for our specialty to reserve the entire place for the bottom

76
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,460
All right

77
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,220
I

78
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:30,820
Don't want a pretzel. Oh, I kind of wish I got pretzels. I would have been tasty

79
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,340
Actually, let me put on some

80
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,820
um

81
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,820
Restaurant ambiance

82
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,940
That's a good idea

83
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,340
It'll probably be copyrighted, but I don't really care

84
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,820
Milk steak, what's milk steak?

85
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:04,980
Sorry, that is a rainbow scratching

86
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:15,060
I

87
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,740
Can't spell restaurant

88
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,980
Can I just

89
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,140
I can't tell what's copyrighted

90
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,300
We'll do this one

91
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,980
You

92
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,700
It's two hours long

93
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,940
Is typing dmca free

94
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,460
They don't care they'll say it's dmca free, but

95
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,980
Wait, what if I

96
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,940
I'll let this one

97
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,820
This is sound effect and it's a little long

98
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,820
I

99
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:16,180
This one is cafe music that's good enough. This one says

100
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,500
Raina if you could stop that would be great

101
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,540
He's just staring at me and pauses

102
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:45,460
Who looks the like of course help yourself. No, she doesn't want attention. She just doesn't know how to use a letter that's proper

103
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,180
um

104
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,180
That is obvious

105
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:02,100
How is that how is the music is it too loud?

106
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,780
I

107
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,580
You are in a lunch date with me

108
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,780
I'm numb numb numb delizioso

109
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,380
Can't open it

110
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,380
I

111
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,740
Smells like farts

112
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,300
I don't know about that one goes

113
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,580
How about these little crackers?

114
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,180
Hmm

115
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:33,620
It's like your date that just chews really loudly

116
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,980
Surprisingly relaxing I'm gonna try some of this

117
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,660
Hmm it actually tastes pretty good. I don't think it's bad

118
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,580
You can pick stuff up with your fingers. That's what I'm doing

119
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:15,220
I have the microphone off the stand because I realize it actually does affect the sound

120
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,860
Somali usually looks a little bit weird. Yeah

121
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,180
Hmm

122
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,980
Do I have any like savory jam

123
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:52,180
Oh

124
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,740
However

125
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,220
Oh my god that is strong is this so good

126
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,860
Has distilled light vinegar

127
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:33,540
Water mustard seed salt white wine root pectin citric acid tartaric acid sugar and spices

128
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,340
I'm mixing it up

129
00:21:52,900 --> 00:22:06,420
I'm gonna put some cheese on it too and a little bit of that salam

130
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,940
And we take a bite

131
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,940
Oh

132
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,980
This mustard is a little spicy

133
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,180
Of course riders

134
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,900
Oh

135
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,580
So what made you want to ask us out?

136
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:55,060
Well, you know, I just wanted to wine and dine you although there's no wine at the table

137
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,780
But I could probably make some appear if I tried hard enough

138
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,700
You deserve a little treat and I wanted to have some special time with you

139
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,260
Because I miss you

140
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,900
All right, I'm opening

141
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,780
Some grapes

142
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,140
Sorry that might have peaked

143
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,940
They're quite sweet

144
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,500
What about some apple

145
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:50,500
You think I look cute?

146
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,580
It's hard to eat with one hand and hold three do

147
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,900
I want a piece of

148
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,820
So how's your thing so far?

149
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,820
Are you gonna tell me

150
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,660
But can I make some right up here

151
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,940
I

152
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,860
Here you can

153
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,420
You know

154
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,740
Have a little bit of that

155
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,740
It's attached to me, but don't worry about it

156
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:27,460
A little tired and a little calm

157
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,620
A little good missing

158
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,620
I've been up since three day, yeah

159
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,020
Why have you been up so late?

160
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:39,540
But back from classes, I hope they went well

161
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:47,300
Finished work and then you went to McDonald's and you're playing Witcher 3 on a date of my beautiful, funny wife as you should

162
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,220
Work as usual

163
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,620
You just woke up. Oh, what are you doing?

164
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:57,380
I don't have midnight emails, so I don't somehow

165
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:01,780
So I don't somehow hungry is about to sleep understood

166
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:09,460
You messed up today. Oh, I'm sure it wasn't that bad. I'm sure you'll figure it out. Don't worry about it

167
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,500
For now, we can hang out and chill

168
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,340
This cheese is quite nice

169
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:25,140
If your noise is in the background it's because rena is going through the groceries that I got earlier

170
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,940
Because there's cat treats in the bag

171
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:35,380
I don't have my cat on this restaurant, but she did

172
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,860
I could put my ears back on but they make my head look bigger

173
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,860
Hmm

174
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,980
Now it looks like I have a monster earring

175
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,740
I have an egg as well

176
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,620
She's gonna fall

177
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,260
There we go, look at it that way

178
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,660
I have some everything

179
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:26,020
Seasoning

180
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:32,420
I like everything van Gogh seasoning it's fun to put on stuff

181
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:39,140
He'll bring me chocolates. It's funny because I actually got myself chocolate

182
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:46,740
So, oh wait. Oh, you guys did get me chocolate. You got me a Reese's. Oh, thank you so much. I appreciate you

183
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,340
You don't like boiled eggs

184
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:56,180
That's like it's one of the ways that I like eggs. I I don't usually eat eggs, but I don't mind boiled eggs

185
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:04,580
I hope you like your new mouse. Did someone get me the mouse? Did you get me the mouse? Thank you

186
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,940
Oh, thank you for the present. You guys come bearing gifts

187
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,220
I take you out for lunch and you're giving me stuff

188
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,220
I

189
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,940
Can't open this

190
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:26,740
Using my teeth, okay, I did it. So I bite a little bit of the boiled egg

191
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:37,220
And then I pour a little bit of that every campaign because you sing on it

192
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,220
I

193
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,620
Highly recommend

194
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,340
Should try it sometime

195
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,820
You've never had a boiled egg

196
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:09,060
As I joke on it, where are you from to never have a boiled egg

197
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,020
How

198
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:31,380
Crack the egg raw right into my mouth. Yeah

199
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:37,060
It's stronger than salmonella and open a little peanut butter thing

200
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,860
Oh

201
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,500
It's um honey peanut butter

202
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:59,940
That's very tasty. It's from adjusting honey peanut butter. This peanut butter is really good

203
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,780
You never had a boiled egg either

204
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,020
We're never had egg in general

205
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,540
Because that's surprising

206
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:47,460
I'll see either. Oh, that's okay them

207
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,460
I

208
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:11,380
Have an apple yeah, I'm not the biggest egg fan either

209
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:16,020
I'm the same way I'll eat it if it's given to me

210
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:22,580
I'm not really a fussy eater

211
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,340
Like I'll still eat stuff. There's like a lot of stuff I

212
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,620
It's not really anything I really don't like

213
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,900
Have a little sweet grape

214
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:50,260
I

215
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:56,660
Very tasty. I think I'm gonna put some more Dijon most out

216
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,980
And then

217
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,460
And then we'll put it in bite

218
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,660
I think I'll put this all together

219
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:36,260
Cotton candy grapes. Yes, I have cotton candy grapes. I think they're too sweet though

220
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:39,860
Because I don't really like I don't like cotton candy

221
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,780
Too much sugar

222
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,780
I

223
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,700
Never eaten frozen grapes

224
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:19,460
Can you pat me no no patting

225
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:36,260
Yeah, you have going to a fancy lunch day for drinking cancel monsters funny

226
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,100
Yeah

227
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:49,220
No pet only kiss only smooch only smooch is allowed

228
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:03,140
Smooch right on the cheek. I know I can't really turn to the side right on the cheek right there

229
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:05,140
Oh

230
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,060
I think it's time for another pickle

231
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,100
Yeah, I'm sorry you can't have a pickle

232
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:35,220
You

233
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:44,260
Now see you don't like the smell what did I tell you it's vinegar lady

234
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,700
Let's do some more egg

235
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,980
I lost a piece of egg

236
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:59,700
It's fine Reina is sniffing it so probably

237
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,500
No, you can't come up here

238
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:24,740
I can't help up. I'm sorry. We're gonna knock everything over

239
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,740
Everything over

240
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,220
Yeah, you want some egg

241
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,220
No

242
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:52,340
And your your date feeds her cat under the table

243
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,740
Oh

244
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,060
That's a good ice

245
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:31,220
There's a does the microphone sound better by the way

246
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,260
Yeah, it's not too quiet anymore is it

247
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,660
I

248
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,860
Perks over serving the place it's part of the charm

249
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,940
Hmm perfect and glab

250
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:14,020
And now I know how to turn off ac koon when I do ASMR so they won't make a lot of noise

251
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:22,020
And I have a program to get out any other background noise and the hum

252
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,740
The hum is actually not even um

253
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:33,860
Going on at all. I think the hum is from my neighbor's ac

254
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,540
And sometimes it will vibrate through the whole building

255
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:42,340
Which could be kind of annoying because I am very particular about sounds

256
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:46,500
And it's just a droning. I don't like repetitive sounds

257
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,140
um

258
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:54,260
It's like a droning sound and so I usually have to put on rain noises. So I don't hear it

259
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,300
I can't get a pickle out

260
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:02,500
No, we lost the pickle oh my god help

261
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,780
It's hard to do with one hand. Can you feed me a bite?

262
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:09,780
Can you feed me your pickle? Okay ready? Uh

263
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:14,340
The pickle in my mouth

264
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,740
Delicious

265
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:35,220
I like that little um emoji a little dinosaur it's always makes me laugh

266
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:40,340
Good good good good. I'm glad I'm glad it sounds good

267
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:52,740
Yeah, what are you doing?

268
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:09,860
I know you can do one. Okay hold on one moment

269
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:14,340
I

270
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:29,780
Ignore the fact that my skin is the wrong color, but whoo and that this is a spoon take a bite

271
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,780
Take a bite

272
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:37,780
Pretend this is I'm scooping you some charcuterie on the spoon

273
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,780
I

274
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,380
Enjoy

275
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,820
You like it is it good

276
00:39:55,780 --> 00:40:00,580
That's a ladle now it's not I don't just carry a ladle in my purse

277
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:09,300
The table's attached to her face

278
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:14,420
You know it doesn't seem to be attached to your face later today

279
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:21,460
A sleeping mask because you snore loudly

280
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,500
I got you

281
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,460
He's doing kind of travel

282
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:38,180
I take you on a nice dinner and I buy you monster and a charcuterie and you're worried about how big my arm is

283
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:46,580
I'll have another apple

284
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:07,060
You can snore in our mini because I snore a lot. Yes

285
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,300
Oh

286
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:29,060
If they're not as cute it's okay, I it's okay. I still I still love you even if they're not as cute

287
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:34,020
Even if you're a loud snore

288
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:39,060
I

289
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:11,700
I fed fear a small piece of cheese. This is quite cute to watch you eat it

290
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,260
So we have some more grapes

291
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:26,260
Um

292
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:36,100
Yeah, I told you to bring lunch

293
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:41,220
Oh beetle juice or alien

294
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:43,220
I really liked alien

295
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:47,300
I'll probably go see beetle juice by myself like I saw an alien by myself

296
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:50,980
This time I'll bring the hair on plush with me

297
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:56,660
I don't people would definitely think that I'm special needs, but it's fine

298
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:58,660
Yes

299
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:20,100
Yes, I still sleep with the plot

300
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:28,660
Oh

301
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,180
Yeah, I um

302
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:45,940
Went on my other account so I could retweet my asmr and then I realized in me tagged me in the photo and I was like

303
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:49,220
Oh my god

304
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,060
That's so cute

305
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:57,860
I'm no longer sleeping in the human dog bed. I am simply sleeping in my bed and fia is with me fia. Where are you going?

306
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:05,140
Do you want an apple you can't have an apple but you she's like trying to smell everything I'm eating

307
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:07,780
Oh

308
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,020
Whoa Costco hot dog

309
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:23,700
We're Costco guys we have giant hot dogs

310
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:27,940
I didn't I didn't give any that pickle

311
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:31,060
If you

312
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:33,860
I'll give you a nickel if you tickle my pickle

313
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:37,140
I

314
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:50,660
Sorry, I'm reading the chat

315
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:56,100
Oh true five dollars Tuesday, that's right

316
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:59,060
My dad

317
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:06,820
Usually gets free tickets for some stuff so he'll give me the free tickets because um

318
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:15,460
For his job, they'll usually get free tickets to take people out, but they just never end up using them

319
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:18,660
So he's like you want these and I'm like, I guess

320
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:26,900
The last time I paid the 20 bucks for a ticket that was ridiculous, but it was worth it. His alien was super good

321
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:39,300
Oh, I hope you feel better. I'm sorry you have a cold. You should listen to my takes care of you ASMR

322
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:57,220
I haven't done any members ASMRs I realized I should probably think about one to do

323
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:12,020
Okay, I am essentially done with food. I don't think I can eat these pickles because they're very acidic and my tummy is starting to hoard

324
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:16,260
Can I take you to the theater?

325
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:22,580
Yeah, if I see beetle juice, I might not stay long to go with me, but I think she might be busy

326
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:28,260
We have made plans to take all of out

327
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:36,180
I am taking them out to dinner because I wasn't able to make it to my friend's bachelorette party

328
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:41,700
Okay

329
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:44,340
Hey

330
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:49,300
I'm just gonna keep the mustard right there because I don't know what to do with it

331
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:00,180
Stop you're making me blush, man

332
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:03,940
You can't carry out like I kicked out

333
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:06,900
Hey

334
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:13,940
Any reveal they're going going where to look your turn. No

335
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:21,140
They don't live near me if they did we'd be hanging out all the time

336
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:23,140
I

337
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,500
My baby blue eyes

338
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:35,220
although

339
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,500
You do you still think my eyes are pretty

340
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:44,180
It's funny you get used to seeing something for so long it kind of doesn't

341
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:47,060
It kind of just looks weird

342
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:49,460
So now like my red eyes look so

343
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:52,260
Different

344
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:58,020
And then I look so pale when I am mom

345
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:04,900
I'm so pale

346
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:08,340
This looks like I have crazy tan lines

347
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:14,020
Isn't it funny

348
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:16,980
I am enjoying lunch

349
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:22,020
You

350
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:33,460
Get a bit closer no respectful distance. There's a table between us. I don't understand what you're asking for

351
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:45,060
Yeah, I changed the stuff around

352
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,780
So

353
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:50,660
Um

354
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:55,780
I actually asked I have to ask strongly about new reference sheet with me tan

355
00:48:56,260 --> 00:49:00,020
And I would like I think I would like freckles and beauty marks

356
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:02,980

And there's a civil war

444

And it's the peanut butter lovers against the non peanut butter lovers

445

I

456
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:56,900
Don't like skippy peanut butter because I don't like the packaging

457
01:00:57,300 --> 01:01:02,260
I don't like the color they have it bothers me. I don't know why I can't explain it

458
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:04,260
I just don't like how it looks so I don't eat

459
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:07,700
Yeah, you cannot have a Reese's

460
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:24,500
I like jam I like putting jam on my English muffins and crumpets. Have you ever had a crumpet?

461
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:34,820
Yeah, but the branding of skippy, I just don't I don't know

No, I like jam jam. I like raspberry preserves. They're my favorite

465
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:19,380
Butter and honey that sounds good

466
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:21,620
I

467
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:27,300
Don't really eat jelly. Jelly is like jello and I don't want the texture

468
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:35,700
Which is weird because you know preserves usually has like the seeds and everything in it, but I like it that way

469
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:38,500
Makes it feel more real

470
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:54,660
All right, it's ice crunching time and then I will send you off to straw knee. I like peanut butter and honey

I

475
01:03:49,060 --> 01:03:51,780
Don't know I just wanted to say that depends and leave you in suspense

476
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:57,540
I like french toast and waffles and pancakes

477
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:03,780
Actually waffles and french toast are kind of even for me. I don't like pancakes that much. Well, I like I'll eat them

478
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:07,140
So I don't like it's not that I don't like them. You know what I mean

479
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:13,300
It depends on it just depends

01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:40,500
I

481
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:49,220
Like chicken and waffles chicken waffles are really good

482
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:55,700

I haven't watched love island in so long and I love love island

486
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:10,740
I got my mom into love island

487
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:22,660
But I did make it to waffle house

488
01:05:22,660 --> 01:05:24,660

489
01:05:36,660 --> 01:05:38,660
