No I'm not going to summon anything.

01:25:06.020 --> 01:25:12.340
I want to do this by myself.

01:25:12.340 --> 01:25:16.900
Sometimes I will like summon to take the aggro off of me if it's a hard boss, usually like

01:25:16.900 --> 01:25:22.940
when I played I would literally do mimic tier, have it aggro the mimic tier and then just

01:25:22.940 --> 01:25:44.500
blackknife the fuck until the blight fucking killed it.

01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:50.820

01:25:50.820 --> 01:26:08.260

I hope someone clipped that shit. It was funny as fuck.

01:32:19.940 --> 01:32:23.940
Oh, thank you. Thank you for the tip, Anonymous. Thank you.

01:32:26.940 --> 01:32:29.940
I don't have my headphones on, so I don't know what was sad, but thank you.

01:32:29.940 --> 01:32:31.940
I'm going to look at it right now.

01:32:35.940 --> 01:32:37.940
I'm trapped in the game.

I'm locked out.

01:33:46.940 --> 01:33:49.940
I'm going to do some stretches. We're just going to get back into the zone. No.

01:33:57.940 --> 01:33:59.940
I don't know.

01:34:27.940 --> 01:34:29.940

01:34:34.940 --> 01:34:37.940
I don't believe it. I mean, it's all railings. What do you mean?

01:34:37.940 --> 01:34:39.940
Fuck you.

01:34:39.940 --> 01:34:42.940
You guys know, like, I'm decent.

01:34:42.940 --> 01:34:45.940
I'm just getting my, I'm getting overeagered. I'm getting greedy.

01:34:45.940 --> 01:34:47.940
I'm not getting my timing right.

01:34:57.940 --> 01:34:59.940
I'm not getting my timing right.

I'm locked out of stream elements.

I'm locked out of stream elements.

I'm locked out of stream elements.

01:35:39.940 --> 01:35:41.940
I'm locked out of stream.

01:35:53.940 --> 01:35:55.940
Okay. I need, where are my airpods.

01:35:55.940 --> 01:35:57.940
I need music. I need music so bad.

01:36:03.940 --> 01:36:05.940
I need music so bad.

01:36:09.940 --> 01:36:20.940
I'm just going to throw on some fucking Rob Zombie.

01:36:20.940 --> 01:36:47.940
I remember, I almost dropped something, I was playing as Rinna as a patient right there.

01:36:47.940 --> 01:36:57.940
I was playing as Rinna being called the lamb, and I was getting my ass handed to me with one of the bosses.

01:36:57.940 --> 01:37:02.940
And so I literally just put on Rob Zombie and I fucking rocked him.

01:37:02.940 --> 01:37:15.940
So that's my go to, is I just play some Rob Zombie, or just some dubstep or something.

01:37:15.940 --> 01:37:19.940
I don't know, I just have an easier time if I listen to music and I don't listen to the game.

01:37:19.940 --> 01:37:24.940
And I can just focus on movement, and so I think the sound distracts me.

01:37:24.940 --> 01:37:27.940
Alright, let me just...

01:37:28.940 --> 01:37:30.940
I'm thinking about playing sick bubblegum.

01:37:30.940 --> 01:37:32.940
The Skrillex remix.

01:37:57.940 --> 01:38:07.940
Shibi is the muppet that's operating the model.

01:38:07.940 --> 01:38:21.940
The muppet's operating the model.

01:38:21.940 --> 01:38:27.940
Dragula, Dragula is also good.

01:38:27.940 --> 01:38:29.940
We all know how we're going to die, baby.

01:38:29.940 --> 01:38:34.940
Wait, I can't have my model open while I have YouTube open, that's stupid.

01:38:34.940 --> 01:38:45.940
Alright, well, ventriloquism.

01:38:45.940 --> 01:38:50.940
Alright, I'm in the zone, I feel good.

01:38:50.940 --> 01:38:54.940
Please, let me the fucking...

01:39:20.940 --> 01:39:26.940
Alright, I'm in the zone, I feel good.

01:39:51.940 --> 01:39:56.940
Now I'm getting too into music.

01:39:56.940 --> 01:40:01.940
Oh fuck.

01:40:01.940 --> 01:40:12.940
Sick bubblegum.

01:40:21.940 --> 01:40:26.940
I can't believe I breathed almost on my first try, and then I fucked it up.

01:40:26.940 --> 01:40:36.940
And I fell off the map the second time.

01:40:50.940 --> 01:41:00.940
Alright, I'm in the zone, I feel good.

01:41:00.940 --> 01:41:10.940
I'm in the zone, I feel good.

01:41:10.940 --> 01:41:38.940
I'm stuck.

01:41:38.940 --> 01:42:06.940
Oh, I just noticed my health.

01:42:06.940 --> 01:42:16.940
I'm in the zone, I feel good.

01:42:16.940 --> 01:42:26.940
Alright, let's do Dragula.

01:42:46.940 --> 01:43:11.940
I'm stuck.

01:43:12.940 --> 01:43:22.940
I'm stuck.

01:43:22.940 --> 01:43:25.940
Now I threw it, I didn't know you could do that.

01:43:25.940 --> 01:43:31.940
Dig through the ditches and I'm not paying attention to my health because this music is good.

01:43:31.940 --> 01:43:35.940
Dragula.

01:43:35.940 --> 01:43:36.940
Hi, Boomi.

01:43:36.940 --> 01:43:41.940
Boomi, I need your little titties as a little stress ball.

01:43:41.940 --> 01:43:44.940
Thank you.

01:43:44.940 --> 01:43:46.940
So many apps.

01:43:46.940 --> 01:43:56.940
Stream's going good.

01:44:16.940 --> 01:44:36.940
I'm in the zone, I feel good.

01:44:36.940 --> 01:44:52.940
Fuck.

01:44:52.940 --> 01:45:04.940
I got cornered, I knew I was going to get stuck back here.

01:45:04.940 --> 01:45:10.940
I'm going to be quiet until I beat him, I apologize.

01:45:10.940 --> 01:45:20.940
I can never die, dig through the ditches and burn through the witches of Sam in the back of my Dragula.

01:45:41.940 --> 01:45:47.940
No, fuck, I didn't get the stagger.

01:45:47.940 --> 01:45:58.940
I got locked into another animation.

01:45:58.940 --> 01:46:27.940
I need heal.

01:46:27.940 --> 01:46:30.940
And no!

01:46:30.940 --> 01:46:42.940
Alright, next song.

01:46:42.940 --> 01:46:52.940
Shut me up, my little self-indulgence, let's go.

01:46:52.940 --> 01:46:55.940
The bass, the rock, the mic, the treble.

01:46:55.940 --> 01:47:01.940
I like my coffee black just like my middle with the bass, the rock, the mic, the treble.

01:47:01.940 --> 01:47:05.940
I like my coffee black just like my middle cuz.

01:47:05.940 --> 01:47:09.940
Oh, knock me up in a minute, minute, minute, and a fucking minute.

01:47:09.940 --> 01:47:14.940
I can't wait for you to knock me up in a minute, minute, and a second.

01:47:14.940 --> 01:47:20.940
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit like fuck.

01:47:20.940 --> 01:47:26.940
It's fine, it's too far away.

01:47:26.940 --> 01:47:35.940
Oh, it was stuck in the animation cuz I accidentally pressed the button.

01:47:35.940 --> 01:47:38.940
Shut.

01:47:38.940 --> 01:47:49.940
La la la, ooh la la la, ooh la la la.

01:47:49.940 --> 01:47:55.940
The whip timed perfectly when you threw it.

01:47:55.940 --> 01:47:59.940
Oh, it's funny.

01:47:59.940 --> 01:48:03.940
I can't wait for you to knock me up in a minute, minute.

01:48:03.940 --> 01:48:10.940
I'm so fucking stupid, I can't wait for you to knock me up in a minute, minute, and a second.

01:48:10.940 --> 01:48:17.940
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit like badass.

01:48:17.940 --> 01:48:23.940
All right.

It's a great music video.

01:48:55.940 --> 01:49:14.940
All right, timed that horribly.

01:49:14.940 --> 01:49:30.940
I thought I was gonna stagger him.

01:49:30.940 --> 01:49:32.940

01:50:12.940 --> 01:50:14.940

Declan hide, five finger death punch.

01:50:37.940 --> 01:50:41.940

01:50:43.940 --> 01:50:56.940
Fuck off!

01:50:56.940 --> 01:50:59.940
I didn't even do a lot of damage.

01:50:59.940 --> 01:51:02.940
Ow.

01:51:02.940 --> 01:51:12.940

01:51:30.940 --> 01:51:32.940

01:51:32.940 --> 01:51:34.940
What are the other cats doing?

01:51:34.940 --> 01:51:35.940
Like nirvana?

01:51:35.940 --> 01:51:36.940
Yeah.

01:51:36.940 --> 01:51:42.940
Something's in my ass.

Maybe I need something at the right BPM.

01:54:39.940 --> 01:55:05.940
Okay, locked to DNMO mix.

01:55:05.940 --> 01:55:34.940
Are you gonna do anything, bro?

01:55:34.940 --> 01:56:01.940
I'm locking in, closing all my tabs, besides the game.

01:56:01.940 --> 01:56:21.940
I'm getting sloppy, bro!

01:56:21.940 --> 01:56:50.940

All right.

01:58:21.940 --> 01:58:22.940

What is up with my timing?

02:01:58.940 --> 02:02:18.940
I don't know why I pressed that twice.

02:02:18.940 --> 02:02:27.940
I shouldn't have healed until I jumped.

02:02:27.940 --> 02:02:47.940

Hey, how the awe feels so accurate here about this expression.

05:47:42.940 --> 05:47:48.940
It's so weird how weirdly proportioned her body is.

05:47:48.940 --> 05:48:04.940
She has such a small head and a huge body.

05:48:04.940 --> 05:48:17.940
I call the kids just disappear.

05:48:17.940 --> 05:48:35.940

Ooh, she's locked in.

05:49:09.940 --> 05:49:24.940
Not many men there.

05:49:24.940 --> 05:49:44.940
I hate that she just jumps out of the way.

05:49:44.940 --> 05:49:49.940
I might just go at her with my sword.

05:49:49.940 --> 05:49:53.940

05:49:53.940 --> 05:50:00.940

Yup, I missed.

05:50:36.940 --> 05:50:48.940
It's really just like, oh, because then you have to deal with her second phase.

05:50:48.940 --> 05:50:59.940
It's also mostly just like, why isn't there a fucking grace next to the thing that pisses me off to no end?

05:50:59.940 --> 05:51:02.940
Because then I gotta deal with these motherfuckers.

05:51:02.940 --> 05:51:15.940
I'm gonna kill them so they don't fucking...

05:51:15.940 --> 05:51:17.940

05:51:17.940 --> 05:51:19.940
Go away.

05:51:19.940 --> 05:51:24.940
I just spam shit and then I gotta like...

05:51:24.940 --> 05:51:26.940
Oh my god.

05:51:26.940 --> 05:51:34.940
This health I don't need to be wasting.

05:51:34.940 --> 05:51:38.940
Yeah, I think the ball route is better.

05:51:38.940 --> 05:51:39.940
Fuck off.

05:51:39.940 --> 05:51:53.940
I don't even bother.

05:51:53.940 --> 05:52:08.940
Sometimes I just want to jump in there and get all crushed.

05:52:08.940 --> 05:52:20.940
Alright.

05:52:20.940 --> 05:52:23.940
Fuck off.

05:52:23.940 --> 05:52:26.940
I can't kill you fast enough.

05:52:26.940 --> 05:52:28.940
Actually, I realize I don't have to kill them.

05:52:28.940 --> 05:52:44.940
I just have to bop them.

05:52:44.940 --> 05:52:59.940
For free?

05:52:59.940 --> 05:53:07.940
Can I please drink a glass?

05:53:07.940 --> 05:53:27.940
Ha!

05:53:27.940 --> 05:53:31.940
Can you chill?

05:53:31.940 --> 05:53:38.940
Am I about to get killed?

05:53:38.940 --> 05:53:42.940
I love the music in this.

05:53:42.940 --> 05:53:43.940
Oh my god.

05:53:43.940 --> 05:53:48.940
I fucking need to lock down bitches.

05:53:48.940 --> 05:53:51.940
Get out of the way!

05:53:51.940 --> 05:54:00.940
Shut up!

05:54:00.940 --> 05:54:05.940
No.

05:54:05.940 --> 05:54:12.940
Oh my god.

05:54:12.940 --> 05:54:41.940
This is annoying.

05:54:42.940 --> 05:54:44.940
Oh my god.

05:54:44.940 --> 05:54:46.940
I was hoping I wouldn't get hit by that.

05:54:46.940 --> 05:55:13.940
That's whatever.

05:55:13.940 --> 05:55:28.940
Get out of the way, you little bitch.

05:55:28.940 --> 05:55:54.940
Thank god.

05:55:54.940 --> 05:55:56.940
Her grippers are huge.

05:55:56.940 --> 05:56:21.940
I like Lady Dimitrescu's feet because Lady Dimitrescu is hotter.

05:56:21.940 --> 05:56:24.940
I'm going to turn into a moon, really?

05:56:24.940 --> 05:56:30.940
It's not really cash money of you.

05:56:30.940 --> 05:56:40.940
Ow, that actually hurt a lot.

05:56:40.940 --> 05:56:49.940
Get over here.

05:56:49.940 --> 05:56:51.940
What the fuck was that?

05:56:51.940 --> 05:57:01.940
Are you a little staff at me?

05:57:01.940 --> 05:57:04.940
Well, this is going to be a long one.

05:57:04.940 --> 05:57:05.940
I can already fucking tell.

05:57:05.940 --> 05:57:12.940
It's going to take a while to kill her, Nala.

05:57:12.940 --> 05:57:13.940
Smash?

05:57:13.940 --> 05:57:14.940
Smash or password for Nala?

05:57:14.940 --> 05:57:15.940
No, she has too many issues.

05:57:15.940 --> 05:57:16.940
I don't feel like dealing with all that.

05:57:16.940 --> 05:57:18.940
She's a weird thing with kids.

05:57:18.940 --> 05:57:20.940
I'm not about it.

05:57:20.940 --> 05:57:23.940
She has 80% magic resistance.

05:57:23.940 --> 05:57:29.940
Wow.

05:57:29.940 --> 05:57:38.940
Should I be using a different weapon then?

05:57:38.940 --> 05:57:40.940
Although she was weak against the gravity.

05:57:40.940 --> 05:57:41.940
I'm not.

05:57:41.940 --> 05:57:55.940
The gravity did do some damage on her.

05:57:55.940 --> 05:57:56.940
Yeah, okay.

05:57:56.940 --> 05:58:02.940
Well, I guess we'll...

05:58:02.940 --> 05:58:06.940
Yeah.

05:58:07.940 --> 05:58:15.940
We'll figure it out.

05:58:15.940 --> 05:58:17.940
Oh, it's just a portal that they come from.

05:58:17.940 --> 05:58:28.940
That's nifty.

05:58:28.940 --> 05:58:29.940
That's true.

05:58:29.940 --> 05:58:30.940
I'm just throwing rocks at her.

05:58:30.940 --> 05:58:31.940
All right.

05:58:31.940 --> 05:58:35.940
Then I'll kill her with the sword and I'll switch to magic.

05:58:35.940 --> 05:58:40.940
I'll switch to the gravity.

05:58:40.940 --> 05:58:52.940
I'm not going to use any of my ashes at all so I can conserve using them.

05:58:52.940 --> 05:59:01.940
I might do a jellyfish to poison her, perhaps.

05:59:01.940 --> 05:59:26.940
Hold on a moment.

05:59:26.940 --> 05:59:42.940
Hi, Fia.

05:59:42.940 --> 05:59:45.940
What are you doing, little girl?

05:59:45.940 --> 05:59:54.940
Just trying to help my lamp.

05:59:54.940 --> 05:59:56.940
You're just getting it stuck to my chair.

05:59:56.940 --> 06:00:11.940
Can you hear her little claws just going...

06:00:11.940 --> 06:00:23.940
Sorry, I need to calm down and pet my cat.

06:00:23.940 --> 06:00:30.940
What are you guys sticking your head in the trash for?

06:00:30.940 --> 06:00:34.940
I just remember to pay them after you beat the boss.

06:00:34.940 --> 06:00:35.940
Fia.

06:00:35.940 --> 06:00:36.940
The deathbed companion.

06:00:36.940 --> 06:00:37.940
Come here, Fia.

06:00:37.940 --> 06:00:38.940
I want to pick you up.

06:00:38.940 --> 06:00:39.940
Fia.

06:00:39.940 --> 06:00:40.940
How well?

06:00:40.940 --> 06:00:41.940
How's it going?

06:00:41.940 --> 06:00:42.940
Oh, look at your little face.

06:00:42.940 --> 06:00:43.940
With your little pink nose.

06:00:43.940 --> 06:00:44.940
With your little eyes.

06:00:44.940 --> 06:00:55.940
You're getting a little round, lady.

06:00:55.940 --> 06:00:58.940
Are you coming a little chunker?

06:00:58.940 --> 06:00:59.940
I don't know.

06:00:59.940 --> 06:01:03.940
Fia kind of looks like a ferret for a meerkat.

06:01:03.940 --> 06:01:10.940
I had to post that picture of her sitting up on her hind legies and she looked so goofy.

06:01:10.940 --> 06:01:17.940
She looked like a little meerkat.

06:01:17.940 --> 06:01:28.940
Oh, shoulder.

06:01:28.940 --> 06:01:30.940
I love a round kitty.

06:01:30.940 --> 06:01:31.940
What do you mean?

06:01:31.940 --> 06:01:35.940
I don't want her to be chunky.

06:01:35.940 --> 06:01:39.940
She needs to be my little small gal.

06:01:39.940 --> 06:01:46.940
I don't want her to get in, like, having health issues or something.

06:01:46.940 --> 06:01:53.940
I remember my friend's cat had this thing about shoving its face in a girl's shoes and just walking around like that.

06:01:53.940 --> 06:01:55.940
That's so funny.

06:01:55.940 --> 06:02:02.940
Fia likes to stick her toys in my shoes and hang out.

06:02:02.940 --> 06:02:04.940
I don't know why.

06:02:04.940 --> 06:02:06.940
She also just likes to lick my feet.

06:02:06.940 --> 06:02:13.940
She woke me up and scared me because she was licking my feet while I was sleeping.

06:02:13.940 --> 06:02:23.940
The other day, I was scared the crap out of me because it was early morning.

06:02:23.940 --> 06:02:29.940
I think I had fallen asleep on the couch or something from watching TV.

06:02:29.940 --> 06:02:33.940
Sometimes if I can't sleep, I'll move to different places to sleep.

06:02:34.940 --> 06:02:41.940
I woke up and she was licking a nibble in my feet and I was like, ah!

06:02:41.940 --> 06:02:44.940
She's something.

06:02:44.940 --> 06:02:47.940
She also really liked when I got my toes done.

06:02:47.940 --> 06:02:55.940
Her and Boomi were sniffing my feet.

06:02:55.940 --> 06:03:00.940
I'm gonna fuck where it'll be us go.

06:03:00.940 --> 06:03:02.940
All right.

06:03:02.940 --> 06:03:05.940
I'm so tired of this lady.

06:03:05.940 --> 06:03:07.940
It's the steps.

06:03:07.940 --> 06:03:08.940
It's the steps that's annoying.

06:03:08.940 --> 06:03:13.940
I wish she was more straightforward.

06:03:13.940 --> 06:03:15.940
All right, we're two-handed in it.

06:03:15.940 --> 06:03:25.940
We're looking for one of the first bitches.

06:03:25.940 --> 06:03:27.940
Ow.

06:03:27.940 --> 06:03:29.940
Unlock.

06:03:29.940 --> 06:03:35.940
There's the next one.

06:03:35.940 --> 06:03:37.940
I hear you.

06:03:37.940 --> 06:03:51.940
Where are you, child?

06:03:51.940 --> 06:03:53.940
Here.

06:04:09.940 --> 06:04:12.940
There's a lot of people singing right now.

06:04:12.940 --> 06:04:17.940
I need to unlock.

06:04:17.940 --> 06:04:23.940
I kind of want to hide over here until she shoots her little fucking thing.

06:04:23.940 --> 06:04:27.940
I've actually never seen her do it.

06:04:27.940 --> 06:04:35.940
Oh, they just get turned into gravestones?

06:04:35.940 --> 06:04:36.940
Oh, my God.

06:04:36.940 --> 06:04:38.940
Fia is actually sniffing and licking my feet right now.

06:04:38.940 --> 06:04:40.940
Stop.

06:04:40.940 --> 06:04:51.940
She heard me talking shit.

06:04:51.940 --> 06:04:55.940
Are they all golf chicks?

06:04:55.940 --> 06:04:58.940
Oh, God, my nose is itchy.

06:04:58.940 --> 06:05:03.940
Ow.

06:05:03.940 --> 06:05:06.940
Get back down here, lady.

06:05:06.940 --> 06:05:19.940
Look at my heel.

06:05:19.940 --> 06:05:35.940
I need one more.

06:05:35.940 --> 06:05:40.940
I love my fucking knocking kids out.

06:05:40.940 --> 06:05:52.940
I'm going to turn into fucking gravestones.

06:05:52.940 --> 06:05:56.940
Oh, that did not save me.

06:05:56.940 --> 06:05:59.940
I'll tell you that much.

06:05:59.940 --> 06:06:08.940
Should have used the Wonders Psychic for that.

06:06:08.940 --> 06:06:10.940
Ow.

06:06:10.940 --> 06:06:28.940
Ow, I walked into that one.

06:06:28.940 --> 06:06:32.940
Ow.

06:06:32.940 --> 06:06:36.940
I didn't know she was an Abbey Shepherd sheep, you viewer.

06:06:36.940 --> 06:06:40.940
Do you have a cat that likes to get high after mineral ice smell?

06:06:40.940 --> 06:06:42.940
What?

06:06:42.940 --> 06:06:50.940
Like the water?

06:06:50.940 --> 06:06:55.940
Oh, I need to get out of the way first.

06:06:55.940 --> 06:06:57.940
Oh, no, that's a shield.

06:06:57.940 --> 06:07:00.940
Oh, no, I'm stuck.

06:07:00.940 --> 06:07:03.940
It's fine.

06:07:03.940 --> 06:07:31.940
Okay, it's not fine.

06:07:31.940 --> 06:07:36.940
No, I was trying to heal.

06:07:36.940 --> 06:07:42.940
Oh, I hate Rinala so much.

06:07:42.940 --> 06:07:50.940
What's another spell like the gravity one that I can use on her?

06:07:50.940 --> 06:07:57.940
What's another spell like that?

06:07:57.940 --> 06:08:07.940
I need something long range, but the thing with the gravity spell is that nothing you have,

06:08:07.940 --> 06:08:14.940
but I can go get it.

06:08:14.940 --> 06:08:19.940
The thing is that, I regret what I was going to say.

06:08:19.940 --> 06:08:28.940
Oh, my, I almost missed again.

06:08:28.940 --> 06:08:43.940
Making my way downtown, walking fast, faces past, and I'm homebound.

06:08:43.940 --> 06:08:54.940
I've been nothing with a strength deck, so that's fine.

06:08:54.940 --> 06:08:59.940
I did, I used, I can't even remember what I beat her with.

06:08:59.940 --> 06:09:06.940
I think I beat her with the Halo Scythe, or did I beat her?

06:09:06.940 --> 06:09:08.940
Wait a second.

06:09:08.940 --> 06:09:14.940
I'm going to do it one more time, and then I realize I should probably upgrade my Glenstone staff.

06:09:14.940 --> 06:09:17.940
I mean, my Muterite staff.

06:09:17.940 --> 06:09:21.940
I didn't do that, I only upgraded my, can I upgrade my staff?

06:09:21.940 --> 06:09:23.940
I can upgrade my staff, right?

06:09:23.940 --> 06:09:28.940
Again, I've never been a sorcerer, so I don't fucking know anything.

06:09:28.940 --> 06:09:33.940
Fia, I can feel you grabbing my chair.

06:09:33.940 --> 06:09:37.940
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

06:09:37.940 --> 06:09:41.940
Fuck, fuck, fuck off.

06:09:51.940 --> 06:09:54.940
Yeah.

06:10:03.940 --> 06:10:30.940
I feel like I'm in prison.

06:10:30.940 --> 06:10:55.460
Oh, I was hoping it wouldn't hit me.

06:10:56.460 --> 06:10:59.460
What am I doing?

06:11:09.460 --> 06:11:11.460
Ow.

06:11:13.460 --> 06:11:17.460
Stop hitting me, they're stupid fucking books. Oh god, everybody's spitting fire.

06:11:25.460 --> 06:11:52.460
I can't tell where she is, is everybody singing the same fucking song? Ow. What? I swear, I already did. Wait, did I miss something?

06:11:55.460 --> 06:12:11.460
Did I? Did I? Did I already kill enough and I didn't even fucking realize? I don't even... I don't... I don't fucking know, bro.

06:12:11.460 --> 06:12:28.460
I feel like it glitched. I feel like it just glitched. Yeah, she fell for like a second and then she got right back up. That was weird. I thought that was me, but I don't think it is.

06:12:33.460 --> 06:12:36.460
Oh, now you come down.

06:12:41.460 --> 06:13:10.460
Okay. Stop, you fucking little bitches. Oh my fucking god, dude, I hate Renala. She's the most annoying... I beat her so easily the first time because I just... I think I know what I'm going to do.

06:13:11.460 --> 06:13:13.460
I think I know what I'm going to get.

06:13:13.460 --> 06:13:42.460
I don't know why her fight music sounds like a good idea.

06:13:43.460 --> 06:13:50.460
Yeah, anime, OST. To me.

06:14:14.460 --> 06:14:28.460
Talisman does make me do double damage. I just skimmed my ass.

06:14:28.460 --> 06:14:41.460
Oh my god. Ah, I didn't mean to do that one.

06:14:59.460 --> 06:15:04.460
Fabulous.

06:15:11.460 --> 06:15:21.460
I am using the meteorite staff. What? Have I not been using it the entire time? I got it. Yeah, no, I'm using it.

06:15:29.460 --> 06:15:34.460
I know what I'm going to go get.

06:15:44.460 --> 06:15:47.460
One moment.

06:15:58.460 --> 06:16:01.460
One moment.

06:16:01.460 --> 06:16:04.460
One moment.

06:16:04.460 --> 06:16:07.460
One moment.

06:16:24.460 --> 06:16:28.460
Wait, I don't think I'm able to scale.

06:16:35.460 --> 06:16:39.460
Fuck, yeah, I need to play it more.

06:16:46.460 --> 06:16:52.460
I need something that builds.

06:16:53.460 --> 06:17:04.460
Maybe if I... I need to poison her or I need to scarlet rot her ass.

06:17:05.460 --> 06:17:11.460
Yeah, the Talisman moves. I don't.

06:17:11.460 --> 06:17:17.460
Which one is that? I know it's the one with the heads on it, I believe.

06:17:17.460 --> 06:17:22.460
There are some arrows. No, bro, what? No.

06:17:22.460 --> 06:17:28.460
With what bow? I don't even have a fucking bow. Jollyfish can poison? Alright, true.

06:17:29.460 --> 06:17:34.460
Serpent bow. That's true.

06:17:40.460 --> 06:17:46.460
But I feel like the Jollyfish will just get fucking, yeah, dragon breath, but you need faith for that.

06:17:46.460 --> 06:17:50.460
I think I have one, aren't I? Okay.

06:17:51.460 --> 06:17:58.460
You can grab the poison mist ash, but I can't apply the ash to my sword.

06:17:58.460 --> 06:18:03.460
Okay.

06:18:16.460 --> 06:18:21.460
I can get the neck, yeah. But like, I don't want to...

06:18:21.460 --> 06:18:27.460
I feel like it would be easier if I honestly just tried to brute force this.

06:18:28.460 --> 06:18:33.460
Hmm.

06:18:35.460 --> 06:18:39.460
Because I don't think it'll help too much.

06:18:39.460 --> 06:18:44.460
If anything, I'll get the medallion, the boost sorcery.

06:18:58.460 --> 06:19:03.460
Breathe in, blast, Talisman.

06:19:15.460 --> 06:19:20.460
Oh, I forgot where he's like, in her Talisman.

06:19:28.460 --> 06:19:33.460
Okay.

06:19:43.460 --> 06:19:48.460
Because honestly, the sword seal is helpful, but it's also fucking me at the same time.

06:19:59.460 --> 06:20:06.460
The dragon crest shield could offset the damage. No.

06:20:17.460 --> 06:20:22.460
Is there a medallion that reduces damage taken?

06:20:29.460 --> 06:20:33.460
Take your ash, Talisman.

06:20:38.460 --> 06:20:42.460
That connection.

06:20:50.460 --> 06:20:54.460
It's not a great job.

06:20:59.460 --> 06:21:04.460
That's true, that would produce the magic taken.

06:21:05.460 --> 06:21:10.460
Good morning.

06:21:29.460 --> 06:21:34.460
That's one of the runes there.

06:21:34.460 --> 06:21:39.460
Yeah, I was thinking about the graven school, Talisman.

06:21:39.460 --> 06:21:44.460
I just have to remember where to get it.

06:21:44.460 --> 06:21:49.460
Plus 1 million in the staff of Blossom, Night Comet, which is a lot of money.

06:21:49.460 --> 06:21:54.460
Yeah.

06:21:54.460 --> 06:21:59.460
Yeah, because I just have to kill the room bear.

06:21:59.460 --> 06:22:04.460
So I'll go and get that.

06:22:04.460 --> 06:22:09.460
And then...

06:22:09.460 --> 06:22:14.460
I'll go and get that.

06:22:14.460 --> 06:22:19.460
And then...

06:22:19.460 --> 06:22:24.460
Well, it's either like, do I want to boost my own or do I want to?

06:22:24.460 --> 06:22:29.460
It's probably better if I actually negate.

06:22:29.460 --> 06:22:34.460
Uh...

06:22:34.460 --> 06:22:39.460
Where is that?

06:22:39.460 --> 06:22:44.460
Wait, no, what am I doing?

06:22:44.460 --> 06:22:49.460
It's in the Weeping Peninsula.

06:22:49.460 --> 06:22:54.460
Where in the Weeping Peninsula is it?

06:23:04.460 --> 06:23:09.460
I need a map.

06:23:14.460 --> 06:23:20.460
Uh...

06:23:44.460 --> 06:23:49.460
Damn it, I fell asleep again.

06:23:49.460 --> 06:23:54.460
It's fine, it's not like I haven't been streaming for like hours.

06:24:04.460 --> 06:24:09.460
Fuck, what number did I say it is?

06:24:09.460 --> 06:24:13.460
I don't know which way I'm fucking going.

06:24:13.460 --> 06:24:18.460
I'm assuming it's 2.

06:24:18.460 --> 06:24:23.460
Where did I put my 1?

06:24:30.460 --> 06:24:35.460
Hey, I wish I would show you when you put your own fucking markers.

06:24:43.460 --> 06:24:48.460
Okay, where's this fucking bear?

06:25:02.460 --> 06:25:07.460
I don't care about no damn goblins, where's this fucking bear?

06:25:07.460 --> 06:25:12.460
There it is.

06:25:12.460 --> 06:25:17.460
What? No, that's not a bear.

06:25:17.460 --> 06:25:22.460
That is the demigod thingy.

06:25:22.460 --> 06:25:27.460
It's demihumanlady.

06:25:27.460 --> 06:25:32.460
She drops like a staff if I recall.

06:25:32.460 --> 06:25:37.460
Where am I?

06:25:37.460 --> 06:25:42.460
It's over here.

06:25:56.460 --> 06:26:01.460
Where's this fucking bear?

06:26:07.460 --> 06:26:12.460
Left side?

06:26:12.460 --> 06:26:17.460
Over here?

06:26:25.460 --> 06:26:30.460
Bear, where for art thou, bear?

06:26:30.460 --> 06:26:35.460
Is it that big ass bear that scratches the tree?

06:26:40.460 --> 06:26:45.460
Oh my god, that scared the absolute shit out of me.

06:26:45.460 --> 06:26:50.460
Unnecessarily loud.

06:26:50.460 --> 06:26:55.460
Ugh, I'm irritated so you guys are gonna die.

06:26:56.460 --> 06:27:01.460
You gonna run away?

06:27:01.460 --> 06:27:06.460
Bitch.

06:27:14.460 --> 06:27:19.460
Oh no, it's just a trap.

06:27:19.460 --> 06:27:24.460
They just laid shit out for me and I fell for it.

06:27:24.460 --> 06:27:29.460
I'm just saying that it's right over around here and it's not.

06:27:38.460 --> 06:27:43.460
I'm just gonna stay up here for a second.

06:27:43.460 --> 06:27:50.460
No, I am, cause I'm like there is a fucking dungeon and I can't remember and it's this big ass white bear.

06:27:50.460 --> 06:27:55.460
I believe, or just like white one.

06:27:55.460 --> 06:28:00.460
I don't remember.

06:28:00.460 --> 06:28:05.460
I'm not spell drained.

06:28:05.460 --> 06:28:10.460
No, I'm not.

06:28:10.460 --> 06:28:15.460
Perfect.

06:28:20.460 --> 06:28:25.460
Wait, they did it.

06:28:25.460 --> 06:28:30.460
They went to the school of sorcery. What the fuck is this other guy telling me?

06:28:36.460 --> 06:28:41.460
First light of the torches. Do I have to really do it? No, this isn't it.

06:28:41.460 --> 06:28:46.460
Do not recall it being difficult.

06:28:46.460 --> 06:28:51.460
I don't remember.

06:29:02.460 --> 06:29:07.460
Inside the earth bore cave.

06:29:07.460 --> 06:29:12.460
Where is the fucking earth bore cave?

06:29:16.460 --> 06:29:21.460
It's showing that the cave is right around here.

06:29:21.460 --> 06:29:26.460
Oh my god, I almost jumped across that.

06:29:26.460 --> 06:29:31.460
Where is the earth bore cave?

06:29:31.460 --> 06:29:36.460
Oh, maybe it's below.

06:29:36.460 --> 06:29:41.460
Yeah.

06:29:41.460 --> 06:29:46.460
Oh my god, I almost jumped across that.

06:29:46.460 --> 06:29:51.460
Where is the earth bore cave? Is it? Oh, maybe it's below.

06:29:51.460 --> 06:29:56.460
Yeah, right over here.

06:29:56.460 --> 06:30:01.460
This has to be a cave over here.

06:30:01.460 --> 06:30:06.460
Thank you.

06:30:06.460 --> 06:30:11.460
Oh, nifty.

06:30:16.460 --> 06:30:21.460
Oh.

06:30:21.460 --> 06:30:26.460
This is fun.

06:30:26.460 --> 06:30:31.460
Why is this rat so strong?

06:30:31.460 --> 06:30:36.460
Alright, where is this fucking bear?

06:30:36.460 --> 06:30:41.460
I forgot that this little thingy drops you.

06:30:41.460 --> 06:30:46.460
Probably shouldn't just be dropping really nearly,

06:30:46.460 --> 06:30:51.460
but I'm just kind of just trying to speed around this.

06:30:51.460 --> 06:30:56.460
Bear. Oh, thank you.

06:30:56.460 --> 06:31:01.460
Oh, you're way stronger than I thought you'd be.

06:31:11.460 --> 06:31:16.460
Oh.

06:31:16.460 --> 06:31:21.460
Fuck.

06:31:21.460 --> 06:31:26.460
Can I get up there?

06:31:26.460 --> 06:31:31.460
That is a good thing.

06:31:31.460 --> 06:31:36.460
Fucking slapping me one, trying to drink.

06:31:36.460 --> 06:31:41.460
Killers are killed by a bear.

06:31:41.460 --> 06:31:46.460
I don't have to have my own kind in this cave.

06:31:46.460 --> 06:31:51.460
Huh.

06:31:51.460 --> 06:31:56.460
Nice try.

06:31:56.460 --> 06:32:01.460
Oh.

06:32:01.460 --> 06:32:06.460
Nice try.

06:32:06.460 --> 06:32:11.460
It was a pickled turtle.

06:32:11.460 --> 06:32:16.460
This is awkward.

06:32:22.460 --> 06:32:27.460
What are you doing, Fia?

06:32:27.460 --> 06:32:32.460
Why are you using my footrest as a cat scratcher?

06:32:32.460 --> 06:32:37.460
I feel like how it's the whole fucking boss thing.

06:32:37.460 --> 06:32:42.460
I know.

06:32:57.460 --> 06:33:02.460
I'm stuck in the bear.

06:33:27.460 --> 06:33:32.460
Fuck.

06:33:32.460 --> 06:33:37.460
Fuck.

06:33:37.460 --> 06:33:42.460
Fuck.

06:33:42.460 --> 06:33:47.460
Fuck.

06:33:47.460 --> 06:33:52.460
Fuck.

06:33:52.460 --> 06:33:56.460
Fuck.

06:33:57.460 --> 06:34:02.460
She died already. Jesus Christ.

06:34:07.460 --> 06:34:12.460
The crazy part is the room bear isn't even the strongest one.

06:34:12.460 --> 06:34:17.460
Bear is angry because I came into its home.

06:34:17.460 --> 06:34:22.460
I mean, you did just come into it.

06:34:22.460 --> 06:34:27.460
Well, it was sleeping and I just kind of walked in and attacked me first.

06:34:27.460 --> 06:34:32.460
Like, let's be real.

06:34:32.460 --> 06:34:37.460
Fuck.

06:34:37.460 --> 06:34:42.460
Fuck.

06:34:42.460 --> 06:34:47.460
Fuck.

06:34:47.460 --> 06:34:52.460
Cool. All right, we did that.

06:34:52.460 --> 06:34:57.460
Fia, can you please stop chewing on my headphones, darling?

06:34:57.460 --> 06:35:02.460
Can I, can you give this back to me?

06:35:02.460 --> 06:35:07.460
Thank you.

06:35:07.460 --> 06:35:12.460
What's up?

06:35:12.460 --> 06:35:17.460
Give me a little kiss.

06:35:17.460 --> 06:35:22.460
Feels like a doll.

06:35:22.460 --> 06:35:27.460
Fader arc? Oh my God.

06:35:27.460 --> 06:35:32.460
Fia, you wanna come snuck?

06:35:32.460 --> 06:35:37.460
Yes.

06:35:37.460 --> 06:35:42.460
Hmm.

06:35:42.460 --> 06:35:47.460
Let me do a little bit more research.

06:36:02.460 --> 06:36:07.460
She says that she's just weak to bleeding and I'm like, well, I tried that.

06:36:07.460 --> 06:36:12.460
I tried to make her bleed.

06:36:12.460 --> 06:36:17.460
It didn't work out.

06:36:17.460 --> 06:36:22.460
It works for her if I can like spam on her for a little bit.

06:36:22.460 --> 06:36:27.460
Honestly, I need more, I need more golden seeds.

06:36:27.460 --> 06:36:32.460
So I can have more health.

06:36:32.460 --> 06:36:37.460
Fia, can you please, what are you doing?

06:36:37.460 --> 06:36:42.460
Come here.

06:36:42.460 --> 06:36:47.460
What are you doing?

06:36:47.460 --> 06:36:52.460
Come here.

06:36:52.460 --> 06:36:57.460
Everything's unbending.

06:36:57.460 --> 06:37:02.460
What, is that moving?

06:37:02.460 --> 06:37:07.460
There's nothing around. I don't like regularly stare at stuff.

06:37:07.460 --> 06:37:12.460
What are you doing?

06:37:12.460 --> 06:37:17.460
What are you doing?

06:37:17.460 --> 06:37:22.460
You leaving me?

06:37:22.460 --> 06:37:27.460
Do what you must.

06:37:27.460 --> 06:37:32.460
Hmm.

06:37:32.460 --> 06:37:37.460
I don't think

06:37:37.460 --> 06:37:42.460
I'll have enough.

06:37:42.460 --> 06:37:48.460
You said that the other talisman

06:37:48.460 --> 06:37:53.460
is around here.

06:37:53.460 --> 06:37:58.460
You're the debate parlor, right?

06:37:58.460 --> 06:38:03.460
I believe.

06:38:03.460 --> 06:38:08.460
I can't really do anything with that because if I take off riding in Sore Seal,

06:38:08.460 --> 06:38:14.460
then I'm not going to be able to wield

06:38:14.460 --> 06:38:19.460
the Moon Veil.

06:38:19.460 --> 06:38:24.460
I thought I was going to miss that.

06:38:24.460 --> 06:38:29.460
What happened again?

06:38:29.460 --> 06:38:34.460
I'm just giving my computer a little breaky poo.

06:38:34.460 --> 06:38:39.460
So you can get him up at Sheeby.

06:38:39.460 --> 06:38:45.460
Up at Sheeby making me feel

06:38:45.460 --> 06:38:50.460
ways I've never felt before.

06:38:50.460 --> 06:38:55.460
She's got a nice one.

06:38:55.460 --> 06:39:00.460
At least I look nice.

06:39:00.460 --> 06:39:05.460
That was a sick nasty outfit.

06:39:05.460 --> 06:39:10.460
It poo.

06:39:10.460 --> 06:39:15.460
Oh brother, this guy stinks.

06:39:15.460 --> 06:39:20.460
And your character looks nice in game.

06:39:20.460 --> 06:39:25.460
Thank you, thank you.

06:39:25.460 --> 06:39:30.460
Just so I don't accidentally do shit.

06:39:30.460 --> 06:39:35.460
My mother died.

06:39:35.460 --> 06:39:40.460
My mother died.

06:39:40.460 --> 06:39:45.460
These books fly everywhere.

06:39:45.460 --> 06:39:50.460
You scratch my nose.

06:39:50.460 --> 06:39:55.460
Ah, that's a fucking thingy.

06:39:55.460 --> 06:40:00.460
Sorry.

06:40:00.460 --> 06:40:05.460
Oh, boomy, why?

06:40:05.460 --> 06:40:10.460
I can't see, boomy.

06:40:10.460 --> 06:40:15.460
Okay, boomy, it's fine if you walk now,

06:40:15.460 --> 06:40:20.460
because now I can just spam killing her.

06:40:20.460 --> 06:40:25.460
Die, die, die, die.

06:40:25.460 --> 06:40:30.460
Ah, back up, back up!

06:40:30.460 --> 06:40:34.460
Ow.

06:40:34.460 --> 06:40:39.460
Ow, I'm stuck, I'm stuck, I'm stuck!

06:40:39.460 --> 06:40:44.460
It's because I'm fucking locked on.

06:40:44.460 --> 06:40:49.460
Oh my.

06:40:49.460 --> 06:40:54.460
Boomy, could you please move?

06:40:54.460 --> 06:40:59.460
You also were sitting in front of my screen.

06:40:59.460 --> 06:41:04.460
As punishment, I hold you like a baby.

06:41:04.460 --> 06:41:09.460
But you like being held like a baby.

06:41:09.460 --> 06:41:14.460
I don't mind my boy.

06:41:14.460 --> 06:41:19.460
Scratchy your chin.

06:41:19.460 --> 06:41:24.460
No.

06:41:24.460 --> 06:41:29.460
Sorry, I'm busy holding my son like a baby.

06:41:29.460 --> 06:41:34.460
Because that's what he is, he is a baby.

06:41:34.460 --> 06:41:39.460
He's the babyest baby that ever babyed.

06:41:39.460 --> 06:41:44.460
He's making like airplane ears while I'm petting him,

06:41:44.460 --> 06:41:49.460
it's kind of funny.

06:41:49.460 --> 06:41:54.460
Big time attention hours.

06:41:54.460 --> 06:41:59.460
Help me step up it, I'm stuck.

06:41:59.460 --> 06:42:04.460
No, you can't leave.

06:42:04.460 --> 06:42:09.460
It's my time, it's my time to snuggle you.

06:42:09.460 --> 06:42:14.460
Mercy?

06:42:14.460 --> 06:42:19.460
Scared the shit out of me.

06:42:19.460 --> 06:42:24.460
That just terrified, oh my god.

06:42:24.460 --> 06:42:29.460
Oh my, I'm so happy I wasn't doing anything

06:42:29.460 --> 06:42:33.460
because I would have thrown my controller across the room.

06:42:33.460 --> 06:42:38.460
Oh my god, everybody, everybody says hi.

06:42:38.460 --> 06:42:43.460
Hello.

06:42:43.460 --> 06:42:47.460
What was that?

06:42:47.460 --> 06:42:52.460
My autonomous dog.

06:42:52.460 --> 06:42:57.460
What? How does it do, is it like a sound board?

06:42:57.460 --> 06:43:00.460
You know, you know, the little like.

06:43:00.460 --> 06:43:04.460
Oh, like the thing, yeah, the like saying.

06:43:04.460 --> 06:43:09.460
Yeah. Oh, I thought that was you.

06:43:09.460 --> 06:43:11.460
No, seriously, it does sound like me sometimes.

06:43:11.460 --> 06:43:13.460
Come on, let me show you.

06:43:13.460 --> 06:43:18.460
Play me a song.

06:43:18.460 --> 06:43:20.460
Play you a song?

06:43:20.460 --> 06:43:22.460
Yeah, yeah.

06:43:22.460 --> 06:43:42.460
Happy birthday to me.

06:43:42.460 --> 06:43:44.460
That was gorgeous.

06:43:44.460 --> 06:43:47.460
Everybody clap, clap for Mercy everyone.

06:43:47.460 --> 06:43:49.460
My chat is very impressed.

06:43:49.460 --> 06:43:51.460
The resemblance is on candy.

06:43:51.460 --> 06:43:55.460
So it's between you and the little music note thingy.

06:43:55.460 --> 06:43:58.460
Oh, I'm dead.

06:43:58.460 --> 06:44:00.460
Especially if you shake it, you can like shake it off.

06:44:00.460 --> 06:44:04.460
Oh my god.

06:44:04.460 --> 06:44:07.460
What the hell, I want one.

06:44:07.460 --> 06:44:10.460
It's like, it's like.

06:44:10.460 --> 06:44:14.460
Here, you know what to do.

06:44:14.460 --> 06:44:18.460
New suggested gift, that's one of those.

06:44:18.460 --> 06:44:21.460
Automaton, is that what it's called?

06:44:21.460 --> 06:44:23.460
Automaton.

06:44:23.460 --> 06:44:25.460
Automaton, that's cool.

06:44:25.460 --> 06:44:29.460
Mercy sounds like an automaton.

06:44:29.460 --> 06:44:31.460
That's what somebody said.

06:44:31.460 --> 06:44:42.460
I mean, I do like it's uncanny.

06:44:42.460 --> 06:44:44.460
Mercy's just screaming in my chat.

06:44:44.460 --> 06:44:47.460
That's what's happening if you just come in.

06:44:47.460 --> 06:44:50.460
Sorry, I saw you were on the open mic and I went,

06:44:50.460 --> 06:44:55.460
can I troll Shibby?

06:44:55.460 --> 06:44:57.460
That's so scary.

06:44:57.460 --> 06:45:00.460
I was so like, I was like locked in, like thinking about,

06:45:00.460 --> 06:45:02.460
okay, what do I have to do next in this game?

06:45:02.460 --> 06:45:07.460
And then it heard.

06:45:07.460 --> 06:45:08.460
Thank you.

06:45:08.460 --> 06:45:12.460
I needed to laugh because I'm starting to get angry.

06:45:12.460 --> 06:45:15.460
Oh my god.

06:45:15.460 --> 06:45:21.460
Well, how are you doing?

06:45:21.460 --> 06:45:22.460
I'm doing great.

06:45:22.460 --> 06:45:23.460
How are you?

06:45:23.460 --> 06:45:26.460
How's Elden Ring?

06:45:26.460 --> 06:45:28.460
Elden Ring's fine.

06:45:28.460 --> 06:45:30.460
Have you ever played Elden Ring?

06:45:30.460 --> 06:45:34.460
No, I'm not ready for souls like yet.

06:45:34.460 --> 06:45:35.460
You're not ready?

06:45:35.460 --> 06:45:38.460
Yeah, I think the motion sickness would actually get to you.

06:45:38.460 --> 06:45:41.460
Yeah, it would be tough.

06:45:41.460 --> 06:45:42.460
That sucks.

06:45:42.460 --> 06:45:45.460
But yeah, it's going well.

06:45:45.460 --> 06:45:47.460
Are you streaming today?

06:45:47.460 --> 06:45:48.460
I am.

06:45:48.460 --> 06:45:52.460
Later though, like in like three hours?

06:45:52.460 --> 06:45:53.460
Two or three hours?

06:45:53.460 --> 06:45:55.460
Roughly three hours, yeah.

06:45:55.460 --> 06:46:00.460
If I'm still around, I'll wade right into you then.

06:46:00.460 --> 06:46:02.460
If I make it that long.

06:46:02.460 --> 06:46:04.460
Yeah, no problem about it.

06:46:04.460 --> 06:46:05.460
Sorry to disturb.

06:46:05.460 --> 06:46:06.460
I just wanted to...

06:46:06.460 --> 06:46:07.460
No, no, you did not disturb.

06:46:07.460 --> 06:46:11.460
Azura did the same thing yesterday.

06:46:11.460 --> 06:46:20.460
I know, I don't know why.

06:46:20.460 --> 06:46:24.460
I'm not hearing people come in when they like go into the discord.

06:46:24.460 --> 06:46:25.460
It's funny.

06:46:25.460 --> 06:46:26.460
It's only in this channel.

06:46:26.460 --> 06:46:27.460
It doesn't work.

06:46:27.460 --> 06:46:29.460
I wonder why.

06:46:29.460 --> 06:46:31.460
Anyways, sir.

06:46:31.460 --> 06:46:36.460
I have a lovely surprise.

06:46:36.460 --> 06:46:38.460
Thank you.

06:46:38.460 --> 06:46:41.460
No problem.

06:46:41.460 --> 06:46:46.460
The dark yandere, everybody.

06:46:46.460 --> 06:46:48.460
Oh my God.

06:46:48.460 --> 06:46:50.460
I love you.

06:46:50.460 --> 06:46:53.460
Love you too, hearts.

06:46:53.460 --> 06:46:55.460
Huggy.

06:46:55.460 --> 06:46:58.460
Make sure you beat the bad guy or the good guy.

06:46:58.460 --> 06:47:01.460
I don't actually know if you're the good guy or bad guy in Elden Ring.

06:47:01.460 --> 06:47:03.460
I'm both, essentially.

06:47:03.460 --> 06:47:05.460
Yeah, that's it.

06:47:05.460 --> 06:47:07.460
I can be either.

06:47:07.460 --> 06:47:09.460
Oh my God.

06:47:09.460 --> 06:47:13.460
My chat is sending their love.

06:47:13.460 --> 06:47:15.460
I love your chat too.

06:47:15.460 --> 06:47:17.460
Hello, Hera.

06:47:17.460 --> 06:47:18.460
Be nice.

06:47:18.460 --> 06:47:25.460
I mean, actually, I think she'd be supposed to be the one to be nice.

06:47:25.460 --> 06:47:26.460
Never mind.

06:47:26.460 --> 06:47:28.460
I've been beating them all day.

06:47:28.460 --> 06:47:30.460
Yeah.

06:47:30.460 --> 06:47:34.460
Torturing them with my Elden Ring gameplay.

06:47:34.460 --> 06:47:36.460
I'm sure you're great.

06:47:36.460 --> 06:47:39.460
You are the resident, one of the residents.

06:47:39.460 --> 06:47:43.460
Uh, souls like.

06:47:43.460 --> 06:47:48.460
I'm sure it's fine.

06:47:48.460 --> 06:47:51.460
It's fine.

06:47:51.460 --> 06:47:53.460
She'd be extremely serious.

06:47:53.460 --> 06:47:55.460
Oh yeah, and happy 4th of July.

06:47:55.460 --> 06:47:56.460
Thank you.

06:47:56.460 --> 06:47:59.460
Happy Canada Day for a couple days ago.

06:47:59.460 --> 06:48:05.460
It's so funny how that are independent days or whatever they are.

06:48:05.460 --> 06:48:09.460
Old or like the days of each other.

06:48:09.460 --> 06:48:12.460
It's always funny.

06:48:12.460 --> 06:48:14.460
Do you get fireworks?

06:48:14.460 --> 06:48:16.460
We get fireworks.

06:48:16.460 --> 06:48:21.460
I think they're doing fireworks around the 6th.

06:48:21.460 --> 06:48:22.460
Oh, okay.

06:48:22.460 --> 06:48:23.460
That's kind of late.

06:48:23.460 --> 06:48:26.460
Yeah, they like, it's like my town desert or whatever.

06:48:26.460 --> 06:48:31.460
And so they're going to be blown off right by my house.

06:48:31.460 --> 06:48:34.460
I feel like because I, and it's going to be.

06:48:34.460 --> 06:48:38.460
I'm wondering if I'm, I have to check the time if I'm streaming at that time.

06:48:38.460 --> 06:48:41.460
Cause then somebody said, I should do ASMR.

06:48:41.460 --> 06:48:47.460
You're being shelled by heart artillery and your mommy is trying to rush you to safety.

06:48:47.460 --> 06:48:50.460
Wait, that's a good plot.

06:48:50.460 --> 06:48:51.460
What the heck?

06:48:51.460 --> 06:48:52.460
I know.

06:48:52.460 --> 06:48:53.460
I'm like, actually.

06:48:53.460 --> 06:48:54.460
Perfect.

06:48:54.460 --> 06:48:56.460
Actually, that might work.

06:48:56.460 --> 06:48:58.460
That's not just might work.

06:48:58.460 --> 06:49:02.460
No, that's really good.

06:49:02.460 --> 06:49:06.460
One of my viewers came up with it.

06:49:06.460 --> 06:49:09.460
Gosh, viewers have like the best ideas.

06:49:09.460 --> 06:49:11.460
They really do.

06:49:11.460 --> 06:49:13.460
Yeah, it's mine now.

06:49:13.460 --> 06:49:15.460
Actually, I came up with it.

06:49:15.460 --> 06:49:17.460
Sorry guys.

06:49:17.460 --> 06:49:20.460
It's all my idea and my little Muppet brain.

06:49:20.460 --> 06:49:22.460
That's where it came from.

06:49:22.460 --> 06:49:24.460
Did you see my Muppet form yet, Mercy?

06:49:24.460 --> 06:49:25.460
I did.

06:49:25.460 --> 06:49:31.460
I noticed I was like, oh my gosh, you could actually put your model behind the Muppet because it's your hand.

06:49:31.460 --> 06:49:32.460
Yeah.

06:49:32.460 --> 06:49:33.460
Somebody did such a good job.

06:49:33.460 --> 06:49:35.460
I love it.

06:49:35.460 --> 06:49:37.460
It looks really good.

06:49:37.460 --> 06:49:40.460
It looks so seductive.

06:49:40.460 --> 06:49:41.460
I know.

06:49:41.460 --> 06:49:44.460
I'm a little seductive Muppet.

06:49:44.460 --> 06:49:49.460
Would you put your hand up her?

06:49:49.460 --> 06:49:57.460
They already said they would make me into one of their socks.

06:49:57.460 --> 06:50:06.460
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

06:50:06.460 --> 06:50:09.460
They're also saying I'm a furry because I'm a Muppet.

06:50:09.460 --> 06:50:10.460
I don't know how that works.

06:50:10.460 --> 06:50:11.460
I don't know.

06:50:11.460 --> 06:50:13.460
You were already a furry.

06:50:13.460 --> 06:50:15.460
You're a bunny.

06:50:15.460 --> 06:50:18.460
I'm a kemama mamimi.

06:50:18.460 --> 06:50:21.460
That's like, you know, just one step away from furry.

06:50:21.460 --> 06:50:22.460
I'm sorry.

06:50:22.460 --> 06:50:23.460
I'm in denial.

06:50:23.460 --> 06:50:25.460
I'm not accepting it.

06:50:25.460 --> 06:50:26.460
Don't die.

06:50:26.460 --> 06:50:27.460
No.

06:50:27.460 --> 06:50:28.460
It's okay.

06:50:28.460 --> 06:50:29.460
I'm joking.

06:50:29.460 --> 06:50:30.460
I'm choking.

06:50:30.460 --> 06:50:35.460
I'm choking on your love.

06:50:35.460 --> 06:50:36.460
Okay.

06:50:36.460 --> 06:50:44.460
That's a way to phrase that.

06:50:44.460 --> 06:50:49.460
But yeah, you're already furry.

06:50:49.460 --> 06:50:50.460
I'm sorry.

06:50:51.460 --> 06:50:59.460
At this point, you're probably, you know, you're probably like so close to like the

06:50:59.460 --> 06:51:08.460
saw, you know, the jigsaw, like fan fictions and fan arts.

06:51:08.460 --> 06:51:09.460
Excuse me.

06:51:09.460 --> 06:51:14.460
No, she calls it like this.

06:51:14.460 --> 06:51:15.460
She sees them.

06:51:15.460 --> 06:51:16.460
No, she has an eye patch on.

06:51:16.460 --> 06:51:18.460
She doesn't know what she's seeing.

06:51:18.460 --> 06:51:24.460
I'm partially blind.

06:51:24.460 --> 06:51:25.460
Oh my God.

06:51:25.460 --> 06:51:26.460
Am I projecting?

06:51:26.460 --> 06:51:27.460
No.

06:51:27.460 --> 06:51:28.460
Of course.

06:51:28.460 --> 06:51:29.460
Oh my God.

06:51:29.460 --> 06:51:30.460
All right.

06:51:30.460 --> 06:51:32.460
Is Vila just a bunch of furries?

06:51:32.460 --> 06:51:34.460
Are we all just furries?

06:51:34.460 --> 06:51:35.460
Yeah.

06:51:35.460 --> 06:51:36.460
Okay.

06:51:36.460 --> 06:51:40.460
I'll accept it if I'm not alone.

06:51:40.460 --> 06:51:41.460
Yeah.

06:51:41.460 --> 06:51:43.460
Look, look at me.

06:51:43.460 --> 06:51:44.460
Look at Amy.

06:51:44.460 --> 06:51:46.460
Heck, we even have icy.

06:51:46.460 --> 06:51:49.460
There's a cuttlefish.

06:51:49.460 --> 06:51:51.460
That's a scaly.

06:51:51.460 --> 06:51:52.460
That's true.

06:51:52.460 --> 06:51:53.460
Is that a scaly?

06:51:53.460 --> 06:51:55.460
I think scaly's are reptiles.

06:51:55.460 --> 06:51:57.460
Oh, shit, really?

06:51:57.460 --> 06:51:59.460
Wait, why did I know that?

06:51:59.460 --> 06:52:01.460
Fuck.

06:52:01.460 --> 06:52:06.460
Mercy, how are you furry?

06:52:06.460 --> 06:52:08.460
Is there isn't an animal?

06:52:08.460 --> 06:52:11.460
Are you not saying that humans are not animals?

06:52:11.460 --> 06:52:15.460
She has a point.

06:52:15.460 --> 06:52:20.460
Oh my God.

06:52:20.460 --> 06:52:21.460
Okay.

06:52:21.460 --> 06:52:25.460
I'm going to attempt to continue with my boss.

06:52:25.460 --> 06:52:26.460
I love you.

06:52:26.460 --> 06:52:28.460
I'll leave you be now.

06:52:28.460 --> 06:52:29.460
I love you too.

06:52:29.460 --> 06:52:30.460
Bye, Mercy.

06:52:30.460 --> 06:52:31.460
See you later.

06:52:31.460 --> 06:52:33.460
I just wanted to spook you.

06:52:33.460 --> 06:52:34.460
Oh, he works.

06:52:34.460 --> 06:52:36.460
I call you furry, I guess.

06:52:36.460 --> 06:52:37.460
No.

06:52:37.460 --> 06:52:38.460
My.

06:52:38.460 --> 06:52:40.460
I love her.

06:52:40.460 --> 06:52:44.460
She's great.

06:52:44.460 --> 06:52:51.460
She's scared of shit out of me.

06:52:51.460 --> 06:52:56.460
All right.

06:52:56.460 --> 06:52:57.460
Don't go.

06:52:57.460 --> 06:52:59.460
You'll see her later.

06:52:59.460 --> 06:53:02.460
You know, she streams at 11 Eastern time.

06:53:02.460 --> 06:53:08.460
She'll be around in a couple hours.

06:53:08.460 --> 06:53:19.460
Yep.

06:53:19.460 --> 06:53:24.460
Yeah.

06:53:24.460 --> 06:53:36.460
What was that?

06:53:36.460 --> 06:53:40.460
I didn't ask.

06:53:40.460 --> 06:53:44.460
I realized I didn't run because it hits the second pillar over there.

06:53:44.460 --> 06:53:48.460
You see where the point of my like bounces off of that then goes to the right.

06:53:48.460 --> 06:54:01.460
And I was still close to the right when that happened.

06:54:01.460 --> 06:54:04.460
I thought I was storming outside, but it's just the game.

06:54:04.460 --> 06:54:05.460
I think.

06:54:05.460 --> 06:54:06.460
Oh, wait.

06:54:06.460 --> 06:54:08.460
No, if people throwing off fucking fireworks.

06:54:08.460 --> 06:54:11.460
See, it bounces off that one.

06:54:11.460 --> 06:54:13.460
And now I got a ride.

06:54:13.460 --> 06:54:14.460
No.

06:54:14.460 --> 06:54:15.460
Sorry.

06:54:15.460 --> 06:54:17.460
It's the first one that bounces off of.

06:54:17.460 --> 06:54:18.460
Wow.

06:54:18.460 --> 06:54:23.460
All my rooms that I got back.

06:54:23.460 --> 06:54:24.460
I wasn't.

06:54:24.460 --> 06:54:25.460
No, I.

06:54:25.460 --> 06:54:31.460
I'm not going to go to the boss after it hits me and knocks my health in half.

06:54:31.460 --> 06:54:34.460
I'm just going to kill myself.

06:54:34.460 --> 06:54:38.460
I'm just kill it because I don't like you have to make sure I have to make sure I'm at full

06:54:38.460 --> 06:54:39.460
health.

06:54:39.460 --> 06:54:52.460
I was just going to work otherwise, you know.

06:54:52.460 --> 06:55:03.460
Oh, I'm hungry.

06:55:03.460 --> 06:55:07.460
Ting.

06:55:07.460 --> 06:55:09.460
Why isn't there?

06:55:09.460 --> 06:55:12.460
I know there's a fucking.

06:55:12.460 --> 06:55:20.460
It's like right here is a grace when you beat her, but yeah, we're doing the moon veil only

06:55:20.460 --> 06:55:36.460
strat up until I get her to her second phase.

06:55:36.460 --> 06:55:42.460
I'm getting fucking got by books.

06:55:42.460 --> 06:55:45.460
Ow, ow.

06:55:45.460 --> 06:55:46.460
You can't.

06:55:46.460 --> 06:55:50.460
Go in the middle of them because they will fuck you up.

06:55:50.460 --> 06:55:51.460
Fuck off.

06:55:51.460 --> 06:55:55.460
You fucking books.

06:55:55.460 --> 06:55:56.460
Sleep tight.

06:55:56.460 --> 06:55:59.460
Shut the fuck up.

06:55:59.460 --> 06:56:04.460
I'm down here, lady.

06:56:04.460 --> 06:56:09.460
I'm missing.

06:56:09.460 --> 06:56:16.460
Thank you.

06:56:16.460 --> 06:56:25.460
Okay.

06:56:25.460 --> 06:56:43.460
I need to see where she's going to throw that.

06:56:43.460 --> 06:56:46.460
This won't break.

06:56:46.460 --> 06:56:47.460
Yeah.

06:56:47.460 --> 06:56:52.460
Okay.

06:56:52.460 --> 06:56:54.460
Bitch.

06:56:54.460 --> 06:56:56.460
Bitch slapping children.

06:56:56.460 --> 06:56:58.460
Oh my God.

06:56:58.460 --> 06:57:06.460
That guy scared me.

06:57:06.460 --> 06:57:07.460
Bitch.

06:57:07.460 --> 06:57:08.460
I missed.

06:57:08.460 --> 06:57:09.460
Bitch.

06:57:09.460 --> 06:57:34.460
I still smells like burnt popcorn.

06:57:34.460 --> 06:57:52.460
I wanted to break her before she did that little move.

06:57:52.460 --> 06:58:02.460
Unlock.

06:58:02.460 --> 06:58:09.460
She's over there.

06:58:09.460 --> 06:58:12.460
Fuck.

06:58:12.460 --> 06:58:22.460
Where is it?

06:58:22.460 --> 06:58:33.460
Ow.

06:58:33.460 --> 06:58:48.460
Ow.

06:58:48.460 --> 06:58:58.460
I'm getting got by books.

06:58:58.460 --> 06:59:04.460
Yeah, everybody just watch as I kill your mom.

06:59:04.460 --> 06:59:11.460
Die.

06:59:11.460 --> 06:59:13.460
Why are you hitting graduates?

06:59:13.460 --> 06:59:15.460
Because I want to.

06:59:15.460 --> 06:59:22.460
They're dumb little children.

06:59:22.460 --> 06:59:35.460
Oh my God.

06:59:35.460 --> 07:00:02.460
Oh, I'm so sick of you.

07:00:03.460 --> 07:00:05.460
What?

07:00:05.460 --> 07:00:06.460
What?

07:00:06.460 --> 07:00:08.460
What?

07:00:08.460 --> 07:00:10.460
Say it to my fucking muppet face.

07:00:10.460 --> 07:00:18.460
Fucking end you.

07:00:18.460 --> 07:00:21.460
I'd rather fucking fight Radon at this point.

07:00:21.460 --> 07:00:25.460
This is just annoying.

07:00:25.460 --> 07:00:27.460
It's a hard not life.

07:00:27.460 --> 07:00:29.460
Knock.

07:00:29.460 --> 07:00:31.460
I said not life.

07:00:31.460 --> 07:00:35.460
It's a hard not life for us.

07:00:35.460 --> 07:00:40.460
All my cat's food is going off instead of kibble.

07:00:40.460 --> 07:00:44.460
We get treats.

07:00:44.460 --> 07:00:56.460
Oh my God.

07:00:56.460 --> 07:00:59.460
Would you really rather fight Radon?

07:00:59.460 --> 07:01:02.460
I don't know, actually.

07:01:02.460 --> 07:01:07.460
At least I could be on fucking torrent.

07:01:07.460 --> 07:01:12.460
This person was like me and definitely ran off.

07:01:12.460 --> 07:01:16.460
I want to punch the blood stain.

07:01:16.460 --> 07:01:20.460
Oh no, that's they died that way.

07:01:20.460 --> 07:01:22.460
You look pretty badass while you were doing it though.

07:01:22.460 --> 07:01:27.460
You got Uchigatana or the Naga something.

07:01:27.460 --> 07:01:29.460
I'm not a furry.

07:01:29.460 --> 07:01:45.460
Oh my God.

07:01:45.460 --> 07:02:05.460
I'm so sick of this song.

07:02:05.460 --> 07:02:06.460
Oh, perfect.

07:02:06.460 --> 07:02:07.460
Oh, I miss.

07:02:07.460 --> 07:02:10.460
Die.

07:02:10.460 --> 07:02:12.460
I'm locked on you.

07:02:12.460 --> 07:02:15.460
Get down here.

07:02:15.460 --> 07:02:28.460
No, not you.

07:02:28.460 --> 07:02:34.460
No.

07:02:34.460 --> 07:02:38.460
Sweetings.

07:02:38.460 --> 07:02:41.460
Little Ting.

07:02:41.460 --> 07:02:43.460
Oh, books.

07:02:43.460 --> 07:02:48.460
Oh, fire.

07:02:48.460 --> 07:02:52.460
Books are my one enemy in this game now.

07:02:52.460 --> 07:02:54.460
I keep missing you.

07:02:54.460 --> 07:02:55.460
I can't.

07:02:55.460 --> 07:02:57.460
There's too many people to focus on.

07:02:57.460 --> 07:03:06.460
It's hard for the camera to lock.

07:03:06.460 --> 07:03:08.460
Fuck off.

07:03:08.460 --> 07:03:13.460
Oh, fucking child landing on me.

07:03:13.460 --> 07:03:17.460
Get down with your bad self.

07:03:17.460 --> 07:03:21.460
Fucking slugs.

07:03:21.460 --> 07:03:30.460
Your feet are big.

07:03:31.460 --> 07:03:48.460
Ah.

07:03:48.460 --> 07:03:50.460
Where is this one?

07:03:50.460 --> 07:03:57.460
Alright, she is.

07:03:57.460 --> 07:04:04.460
Not too bad.

07:04:04.460 --> 07:04:14.460
They are going to fall.

07:04:14.460 --> 07:04:24.460
Oh, fucking books.

07:04:24.460 --> 07:04:37.460
I feel like Art of Muppets should be wearing a shroud.

07:04:37.460 --> 07:04:38.460
It would be funny.

07:04:38.460 --> 07:04:40.460
Jesus Christ.

07:04:40.460 --> 07:04:49.460
That would be hilarious, actually.

07:04:49.460 --> 07:04:58.460
Oh, why was that taking forever?

07:04:58.460 --> 07:05:18.460
Do I have to go up close to you?

07:05:18.460 --> 07:05:40.460
Okay, I realize it's better to roll towards her.

07:05:40.460 --> 07:05:46.460
I'm running out of stamina, though.

07:05:46.460 --> 07:05:53.460
No, I'm coming through.

07:05:53.460 --> 07:05:56.460
Do I have to click it?

07:05:56.460 --> 07:06:08.460
Oh, fuck you.

07:06:08.460 --> 07:06:17.460
Fucking bitch.

07:06:17.460 --> 07:06:23.460
Ow.

07:06:23.460 --> 07:06:24.460
No, no, I don't want to die.

07:06:24.460 --> 07:06:29.460
I don't want to die.

07:06:29.460 --> 07:06:35.460
I just get the timing right for that one.

07:06:35.460 --> 07:06:37.460
Oh, no.

07:06:37.460 --> 07:06:38.460
I'm attacking you.

07:06:38.460 --> 07:06:41.460
I don't care about any of that shit.

07:06:41.460 --> 07:06:52.460
Nope, nope.

07:06:52.460 --> 07:07:02.460
You're mine.

07:07:02.460 --> 07:07:10.460
Hold on.

07:07:10.460 --> 07:07:19.460
Fuck off.

07:07:19.460 --> 07:07:21.460
Oh.

07:07:21.460 --> 07:07:23.460
Stop it.

07:07:23.460 --> 07:07:25.460
Enough.

07:07:25.460 --> 07:07:27.460
You're done, Manala.

07:07:27.460 --> 07:07:28.460
Sit.

07:07:28.460 --> 07:07:37.460
Get fucking...

07:07:37.460 --> 07:07:42.460
Yeah.

07:07:42.460 --> 07:07:47.460
Yeah.

07:07:47.460 --> 07:07:49.460
First try.

07:07:49.460 --> 07:07:51.460
100% first try.

07:07:51.460 --> 07:07:55.460
I think one of that only took me like seven tries?

07:07:55.460 --> 07:07:57.460
Eight tries, maybe ten?

07:07:57.460 --> 07:08:00.460
I don't know.

07:08:00.460 --> 07:08:05.460
That'll go through close for loose change.

07:08:05.460 --> 07:08:14.460
Yeah, I'll be right back.

07:08:14.460 --> 07:08:23.460
Hey.

07:08:23.460 --> 07:08:26.460
Me.

07:08:26.460 --> 07:08:32.460
I need shit for that.

07:08:32.460 --> 07:08:35.460
I'm a gamer.

07:08:35.460 --> 07:08:37.460
Pulling those dodges off.

07:08:37.460 --> 07:08:38.460
I'm telling you.

07:08:38.460 --> 07:08:44.460
A pee really helps me with Eleanor because I would not be able to do this normally.

07:08:44.460 --> 07:08:52.460
Normally I could not get dodges right and I literally would just either cheese a boss

07:08:52.460 --> 07:08:54.460
or I just spam shit.

07:08:54.460 --> 07:09:01.460
But I'm actually pretty proud of myself that this run I am actually like dodging.

07:09:01.460 --> 07:09:25.460
I would be parrying too if I was doing that sort of build but I'm not.

07:09:25.460 --> 07:09:29.460
I know I'm no gamer but I'm not like painfully bad.

07:09:29.460 --> 07:09:44.460
But I'm not painfully bad.

07:09:44.460 --> 07:09:45.460
Perseverance.

07:09:45.460 --> 07:09:46.460
That's my word.

07:09:46.460 --> 07:09:47.460
That's my word this year.

07:09:47.460 --> 07:09:50.460
Perseverance.

07:09:50.460 --> 07:09:55.460
I'm entertainingly bad.

07:09:55.460 --> 07:09:57.460
I'm not a gamer at the end of this playthrough.

07:09:57.460 --> 07:09:59.460
A true gamer.

07:09:59.460 --> 07:10:11.460
Sick.

07:10:11.460 --> 07:10:13.460
You're kind of weird.

07:10:13.460 --> 07:10:19.460
You're just a bit weird.

07:10:19.460 --> 07:10:21.460
Is it audio skipping for anyone else?

07:10:21.460 --> 07:10:22.460
Is it audio skipping?

07:10:22.460 --> 07:10:24.460
I don't know.

07:10:24.460 --> 07:10:25.460
I went through a lot.

07:10:25.460 --> 07:10:39.460
I can't really lock her for it.

07:10:39.460 --> 07:10:40.460
Okay.

07:10:40.460 --> 07:10:43.460
Let me do...

07:10:43.460 --> 07:10:46.460
Should I do more intelligence?

07:10:46.460 --> 07:10:47.460
Yeah.

07:10:47.460 --> 07:10:52.460
I feel like that's good.

07:10:52.460 --> 07:10:57.460
Because then I won't need Radigan's Scar Seal to fucking wield this.

07:10:57.460 --> 07:11:06.460
I don't think.

07:11:06.460 --> 07:11:08.460
Oh I need Strength and Dex.

07:11:08.460 --> 07:11:09.460
Oh you're right.

07:11:09.460 --> 07:11:12.460
Because I need 18 and I need 12.

07:11:12.460 --> 07:11:13.460
Fuck.

07:11:13.460 --> 07:11:19.460
I wish I read that before.

07:11:19.460 --> 07:11:20.460
Fuck.

07:11:20.460 --> 07:11:24.460
It's fine.

07:11:24.460 --> 07:11:25.460
It's fine.

07:11:25.460 --> 07:11:29.460
What does her green do?

07:11:29.460 --> 07:11:30.460
I don't know.

07:11:30.460 --> 07:11:31.460
I don't have it yet.

07:11:31.460 --> 07:11:32.460
It doesn't really matter.

07:11:32.460 --> 07:11:33.460
Yeah.

07:11:33.460 --> 07:11:36.460
It's just two more levels.

07:11:36.460 --> 07:11:37.460
In fact.

07:11:37.460 --> 07:11:40.460
Oh shit.

07:11:40.460 --> 07:11:49.460
I haven't been doing any crafting or nothing.

07:11:49.460 --> 07:11:54.460
Do I need to go somewhere to do her rune?

07:11:54.460 --> 07:11:55.460
I don't have to.

07:11:55.460 --> 07:11:56.460
Right?

07:11:56.460 --> 07:11:57.460
Oh.

07:11:57.460 --> 07:12:04.460
I don't have to.

07:12:04.460 --> 07:12:05.460
Oh.

07:12:05.460 --> 07:12:06.460
Yeah.

07:12:06.460 --> 07:12:11.460
Is it Ronnie's wedding ring in there?

07:12:11.460 --> 07:12:13.460
I need a larvae.

07:12:13.460 --> 07:12:14.460
That's right.

07:12:14.460 --> 07:12:16.460
I would need a larvae.

07:12:16.460 --> 07:12:17.460
Larva.

07:12:17.460 --> 07:12:18.460
Larvae.

07:12:18.460 --> 07:12:22.460
I don't know what the fuck I'm saying.

07:12:22.460 --> 07:12:23.460
That's true.

07:12:23.460 --> 07:12:24.460
I could use the Remembrances.

07:12:24.460 --> 07:12:27.460
Because I don't really care about the items.

07:12:27.460 --> 07:12:30.460
The only item I care about is Radon's bow.

07:12:30.460 --> 07:12:36.460
Because I'm going to need that for farming.

07:12:37.460 --> 07:12:57.460
I might as well do that now then.

07:12:57.460 --> 07:12:58.460
Wait.

07:12:58.460 --> 07:12:59.460
Do I have to go to the fucking...

07:12:59.460 --> 07:13:20.460
I was like, where is it?

07:13:20.460 --> 07:13:27.460
I might as well just go here first.

07:13:27.460 --> 07:13:41.460
Do I only have...

07:13:41.460 --> 07:13:42.460
I don't...

07:13:42.460 --> 07:13:45.460
You're going to laugh at me, but I thought this was a helmet.

07:13:45.460 --> 07:13:51.460
And I just realized it was Ronaldo.

07:13:51.460 --> 07:13:52.460
I like how I just went past it.

07:13:52.460 --> 07:13:54.460
And I was like, oh, where is it?

07:13:54.460 --> 07:13:59.460
It's right fucking there.

07:13:59.460 --> 07:14:00.460
Yeah.

07:14:00.460 --> 07:14:01.460
Because what's hers?

07:14:01.460 --> 07:14:02.460
Wait.

07:14:02.460 --> 07:14:10.460
Before I do hers, does hers give a spell?

07:14:10.460 --> 07:14:11.460
I don't want her funny hat.

07:14:11.460 --> 07:14:16.460
I don't care about her funny hat.

07:14:16.460 --> 07:14:26.460
I hate her hat so much.

07:14:26.460 --> 07:14:28.460
Hers does give a spell.

07:14:28.460 --> 07:14:29.460
Is it?

07:14:29.460 --> 07:14:34.460
It's the comet, isn't it?

07:14:34.460 --> 07:14:36.460
I'm not going to do hers then.

07:14:36.460 --> 07:14:38.460
It's the moon bomb.

07:14:38.460 --> 07:14:40.460
Oh, I never fucking even use that.

07:14:40.460 --> 07:14:41.460
Never mind.

07:14:41.460 --> 07:14:42.460
Yeah, that's right.

07:14:42.460 --> 07:14:44.460
I recall now.

07:14:44.460 --> 07:15:05.460
I think I got her funky little hat instead.

07:15:05.460 --> 07:15:15.460
Yippee.

07:15:15.460 --> 07:15:16.460
Yippee.

07:15:16.460 --> 07:15:17.460
Her staff is good.

07:15:17.460 --> 07:15:18.460
I don't really care.

07:15:18.460 --> 07:15:28.460
It's one of the best staffs, but it isn't the best staff.

07:15:28.460 --> 07:15:29.460
My staff's fine.

07:15:29.460 --> 07:15:34.460
I can always get a better one late game.

07:15:34.460 --> 07:15:42.460
Her staff is good, but what am I doing?

07:15:42.460 --> 07:15:43.460
I'm looking fashionable.

07:15:43.460 --> 07:15:44.460
That's what I'm doing.

07:15:44.460 --> 07:15:47.460
What am I doing?

07:15:47.460 --> 07:15:52.460
I totally forgot what I was going to do.

07:15:52.460 --> 07:15:54.460
Oh, no.

07:15:55.460 --> 07:16:05.460
Okay, I don't need that.

07:16:05.460 --> 07:16:16.460
So now I can stop fucking myself over with that.

07:16:16.460 --> 07:16:22.460
So where is the graven?

07:16:22.460 --> 07:16:24.460
Damn.

07:16:24.460 --> 07:16:26.460
Look at her feet.

07:16:26.460 --> 07:16:27.460
Look at her soles.

07:16:27.460 --> 07:16:29.460
She's a little dimple on her foot.

07:16:29.460 --> 07:16:32.460
Interesting.

07:16:32.460 --> 07:16:35.460
Anything else that I can see?

07:16:35.460 --> 07:16:37.460
Oh, all right.

07:16:37.460 --> 07:16:39.460
I hate your...

07:16:39.460 --> 07:16:43.460
Your weirdly proportioned body is so disturbing to me.

07:16:43.460 --> 07:16:46.460
It is generally uncanny valley and it bothers me so much.

07:16:46.460 --> 07:16:47.460
Oh, wow.

07:16:47.460 --> 07:16:48.460
Look who's that.

07:16:48.460 --> 07:16:49.460
It's Radigan.

07:16:49.460 --> 07:16:52.460
Fascinating.

07:16:52.460 --> 07:17:07.460
So now we're going to get the school.

07:17:07.460 --> 07:17:08.460
I'm looking at her feet.

07:17:08.460 --> 07:17:09.460
Don't worry about it.

07:17:09.460 --> 07:17:24.460
Don't worry about your own feet because I'm covering your feet.

07:17:24.460 --> 07:17:29.460
Probably also...

07:17:29.460 --> 07:17:47.460
There's another wonder physics.

07:17:47.460 --> 07:18:07.460
Okay, okay, okay.

07:18:07.460 --> 07:18:13.460
Not my grippers, madame.

07:18:13.460 --> 07:18:16.460
Your grippers are not safe.

07:18:16.460 --> 07:18:29.460
Exit the parlor.

07:18:29.460 --> 07:18:32.460
There's an illusory wall.

07:18:32.460 --> 07:18:36.460
Attack the bookshelf.

07:18:36.460 --> 07:18:38.460
Oh, before the stairs.

07:18:38.460 --> 07:18:40.460
For the stairs.

07:18:40.460 --> 07:18:43.460
This one.

07:18:43.460 --> 07:18:45.460
Where is it?

07:18:45.460 --> 07:18:58.460
Oh, it's this one.

07:18:58.460 --> 07:19:03.460
Sick, we got Comet.

07:19:03.460 --> 07:19:06.460
All right, where is the ladder?

07:19:06.460 --> 07:19:13.460
This is not the ladder you climb.

07:19:13.460 --> 07:19:17.460
Follow the wall to a room with the ladder.

07:19:17.460 --> 07:19:30.460
Oh, this one.

07:19:30.460 --> 07:19:42.460
Sorry, I just wanted to break that.

07:19:42.460 --> 07:19:49.460
Time for jumping.

07:19:49.460 --> 07:20:00.460
I want to jump.

07:20:00.460 --> 07:20:11.460
Do I have to go down?

07:20:11.460 --> 07:20:13.460
That's a creepy little hole.

07:20:13.460 --> 07:20:14.460
Let me go this way first.

07:20:14.460 --> 07:20:15.460
There's nothing there.

07:20:15.460 --> 07:20:23.460
Okay, we go down the creepy little hole.

07:20:23.460 --> 07:20:28.460
Be wary of group.

07:20:28.460 --> 07:20:30.460
I don't see anything.

07:20:30.460 --> 07:20:33.460
Is it the jars?

07:20:33.460 --> 07:20:48.460
I guess it is the jars.

07:20:48.460 --> 07:21:01.460
How do I get out of here?

07:21:01.460 --> 07:21:03.460
Walk with me, little jar.

07:21:03.460 --> 07:21:07.460
Oh, never mind.

07:21:07.460 --> 07:21:17.460
Now, now, fuck, shit.

07:21:17.460 --> 07:21:19.460
Excuse me, pardon me.

07:21:19.460 --> 07:21:23.460
Excuse me, pardon me.

07:21:23.460 --> 07:21:32.460
She's in the walls.

07:21:32.460 --> 07:21:38.460
Yeah, fuck, now I'm a heavy load.

07:21:38.460 --> 07:21:41.460
Why am I going to fat roll?

07:21:41.460 --> 07:21:44.460
Are you serious?

07:21:44.460 --> 07:21:53.460
That's so stupid.

07:21:53.460 --> 07:21:59.460
Actually, I don't really need the spells right now.

07:21:59.460 --> 07:22:02.460
My microphone is in my face.

07:22:02.460 --> 07:22:08.460
I'll put that back on.

07:22:08.460 --> 07:22:10.460
It's still a heavy load.

07:22:10.460 --> 07:22:13.460
Okay.

07:22:13.460 --> 07:22:23.460
That's better.

07:22:23.460 --> 07:22:25.460
Got one grim difference.

07:22:25.460 --> 07:22:27.460
Broke a sand.

07:22:27.460 --> 07:22:28.460
I know.

07:22:28.460 --> 07:22:29.460
Just drop the shield.

07:22:29.460 --> 07:22:30.460
Oh, yeah, what the fuck?

07:22:30.460 --> 07:22:33.460
I have the shield on.

07:22:33.460 --> 07:22:43.460
I need that shit.

07:22:43.460 --> 07:22:54.460
I need those right now.

07:22:54.460 --> 07:22:56.460
Now we big chillin'.

07:22:56.460 --> 07:22:59.460
Okay.

07:22:59.460 --> 07:23:07.460
So, we got Morgan, Godric, and Rinala.

07:23:07.460 --> 07:23:19.460
Now we just need to...

07:23:19.460 --> 07:23:30.460
I believe I have to go rest at a side of grace outside of this, right?

07:23:30.460 --> 07:23:34.460
Or does this count?

07:23:34.460 --> 07:23:48.460
Oh, fuck, do I get out of here anyways?

07:23:48.460 --> 07:23:53.460
No.

07:23:53.460 --> 07:23:57.460
Oh, my God, he's scared the fuck out of me.

07:23:57.460 --> 07:24:02.460
Jesus Christ, he's scared the shit out of me.

07:24:02.460 --> 07:24:10.460
Oh, I'm alive?

07:24:10.460 --> 07:24:11.460
Oh, my God.

07:24:11.460 --> 07:24:17.460
I just got a fucking shiver from that.

07:24:17.460 --> 07:24:26.460
Okay, if it's redawn time, it's redawn time.

07:24:26.460 --> 07:24:33.460
Fuck, I have to go really far.

07:24:33.460 --> 07:24:34.460
I just don't like the noises they make.

07:24:34.460 --> 07:24:42.460
It freaks me out.

07:24:42.460 --> 07:24:44.460
Yeah, they do do way too much damage.

07:24:44.460 --> 07:24:47.460
I don't know the type of damage that they do.

07:24:47.460 --> 07:24:54.460
I don't know why I teleported all the way over here when I shifted down over here.

07:24:54.460 --> 07:25:08.460
We'll see if it works, and we'll see if we can fuck up redawn.

07:25:08.460 --> 07:25:31.460
Let's do it.

07:25:31.460 --> 07:25:36.460
What's up with the music?

07:25:36.460 --> 07:25:38.460
My favorite place to be.

07:25:38.460 --> 07:25:41.460
Okay, look how beautiful sunny skies.

07:25:41.460 --> 07:25:44.460
It's really gorgeous out.

07:25:44.460 --> 07:25:46.460
Got a dude here.

07:25:46.460 --> 07:25:49.460
I'll say hi.

07:25:49.460 --> 07:25:54.460
What do you got?

07:25:54.460 --> 07:25:57.460
I haven't even been using any of that stuff.

07:25:57.460 --> 07:25:58.460
I haven't been crafting shit.

07:25:58.460 --> 07:26:02.460
I haven't been doing anything.

07:26:02.460 --> 07:26:04.460
I'll do all that later.

07:26:04.460 --> 07:26:07.460
When I get to DLC, I'll focus on getting a lot.

07:26:07.460 --> 07:26:11.460
I'm just trying to get to DLC right now.

07:26:11.460 --> 07:26:13.460
What the hell?

07:26:13.460 --> 07:26:19.460
There's a casual golden seed.

07:26:19.460 --> 07:26:24.460
Alright, let's keep going.

07:26:24.460 --> 07:26:26.460
I want to be known before I go to sleep.

07:26:26.460 --> 07:26:29.460
Imagine Muppet should be killing the bosses of the sound clip.

07:26:29.460 --> 07:26:33.460
Miss Picky Karate Choppy Kermit!

07:26:33.460 --> 07:26:37.460
Has been amusing me all stream.

07:26:37.460 --> 07:26:38.460
That is hilarious.

07:26:38.460 --> 07:26:40.460
Thank you, Oregon.

07:26:40.460 --> 07:26:43.460
Have a good sleep.

07:26:43.460 --> 07:26:46.460
Oh my god, that just made me chuckle.

07:26:46.460 --> 07:26:48.460
There's a lot of puppies around here.

07:26:48.460 --> 07:26:49.460
I don't want to anger the puppies.

07:26:49.460 --> 07:26:52.460
I like how this one, the bird, that's not a death bird,

07:26:52.460 --> 07:26:59.460
but the bird just kind of sits there and chills.

07:26:59.460 --> 07:27:02.460
Sneaky?

07:27:02.460 --> 07:27:07.460
Sneaky?

07:27:07.460 --> 07:27:16.460
Sneaky, sneaky, be careful.

07:27:16.460 --> 07:27:18.460
Are they chilling?

07:27:18.460 --> 07:27:28.460
Yeah, I know how terrifying they are.

07:27:28.460 --> 07:27:32.460
Sick.

07:27:32.460 --> 07:27:34.460
I don't have any sacred tears, right?

07:27:34.460 --> 07:27:36.460
I thought I did when it said,

07:27:36.460 --> 07:27:37.460
Oh, you want to use a sacred tear?

07:27:37.460 --> 07:27:57.460
I'm like, oh yeah, sure.

07:27:57.460 --> 07:27:59.460
I need 52 intelligence for that.

07:27:59.460 --> 07:28:01.460
Jesus Christ.

07:28:01.460 --> 07:28:06.460
Alright, well.

07:28:06.460 --> 07:28:13.460
Let's ride and avoid shit.

07:28:13.460 --> 07:28:14.460
Where is it?

07:28:14.460 --> 07:28:15.460
There it is.

07:28:15.460 --> 07:28:19.460
Oh, that already fucking took out Torrent so fast.

07:28:19.460 --> 07:28:25.460
Alright, nevermind.

07:28:25.460 --> 07:28:27.460
I wanted to get away from the fire,

07:28:27.460 --> 07:28:30.460
because I knew I was going to die.

07:28:30.460 --> 07:28:35.460
It's fine.

07:28:35.460 --> 07:28:38.460
I got that.

07:28:38.460 --> 07:28:41.460
I've always been kind of confused by that.

07:28:41.460 --> 07:28:42.460
Why is that?

07:28:42.460 --> 07:28:45.460
Oh, there's a portal here.

07:28:45.460 --> 07:28:56.460
It cannot be used now.

07:28:56.460 --> 07:29:21.460
Damn, fucking Torrent is getting God right now.

07:29:21.460 --> 07:29:22.460
Oh, Torrent, please.

07:29:22.460 --> 07:29:23.460
Oh, come on, Torrent.

07:29:23.460 --> 07:29:24.460
You got this, Torrent.

07:29:24.460 --> 07:29:37.460
Come on, Torrent.

07:29:37.460 --> 07:29:42.460
It's fine.

07:29:42.460 --> 07:29:45.460
Oh, well.

07:29:45.460 --> 07:30:01.460
This will be fun.

07:30:01.460 --> 07:30:09.460
Hey, nice.

07:30:09.460 --> 07:30:10.460
How did the...

07:30:10.460 --> 07:30:14.460
Oh.

07:30:14.460 --> 07:30:15.460
Who's manning this trebuchet?

07:30:15.460 --> 07:30:20.460
I just want to talk.

07:30:20.460 --> 07:30:22.460
I came up all the way here to kill you.

07:30:22.460 --> 07:30:36.460
I thought this is where Red Main Castle was.

07:30:36.460 --> 07:30:37.460
Something near me?

07:30:37.460 --> 07:30:38.460
Oh, fucking bat.

07:30:38.460 --> 07:30:40.460
What's up, bitch?

07:30:40.460 --> 07:30:42.460
Can I launch myself back?

07:30:42.460 --> 07:30:43.460
That'd be funny.

07:30:43.460 --> 07:30:48.460
I want to launch myself.

07:30:48.460 --> 07:30:53.460
Yeah, that'd be nifty.

07:30:53.460 --> 07:31:07.460
No, we both can't attack each other.

07:31:07.460 --> 07:31:23.460
Damn it, I thought I could jump right before, but there's a little thing right there.

07:31:23.460 --> 07:31:25.460
Did you sit at an altar?

07:31:25.460 --> 07:31:31.460
Apparently, Volcano Manor doesn't count.

07:31:31.460 --> 07:31:33.460
How many runes did I lose?

07:31:33.460 --> 07:31:35.460
Can somebody tell me?

07:31:35.460 --> 07:31:43.460
Actually, I can tell myself.

07:31:43.460 --> 07:31:50.460
I am blocking how many runes I have.

07:31:50.460 --> 07:31:51.460
It probably doesn't matter.

07:31:51.460 --> 07:31:52.460
I don't really care that much.

07:31:52.460 --> 07:31:53.460
Yeah, four to five K.

07:31:53.460 --> 07:31:54.460
I don't really care that much.

07:31:54.460 --> 07:32:03.460
It's not a big deal.

07:32:03.460 --> 07:32:11.460
Okay, yeah, that doesn't count.

07:32:11.460 --> 07:32:16.460
Let's go back.

07:32:16.460 --> 07:32:21.460
Try to leave the fucking manor.

07:32:21.460 --> 07:32:30.460
Well, frick!

07:32:30.460 --> 07:32:36.460
Sorry, rubbing my fucking ears, because the headphones itself don't hurt.

07:32:36.460 --> 07:32:41.460
It's just that when I'm wearing my glasses with them, they press a little bit.

07:32:41.460 --> 07:32:46.460
It's like a little headdent.

07:32:46.460 --> 07:32:51.460
I have dents about my fucking ears.

07:32:51.460 --> 07:32:57.460
Now, how the fuck am I supposed to leave this place?

07:32:57.460 --> 07:32:58.460
There's a grace here.

07:32:58.460 --> 07:33:08.460
I can't fucking remember.

07:33:08.460 --> 07:33:17.460
I wish I had Bloodhound Step, because then I would just attach that to a dagger and fucking go wherever.

07:33:17.460 --> 07:33:18.460
That's where it came from?

07:33:18.460 --> 07:33:19.460
No.

07:33:19.460 --> 07:33:20.460
Sure.

07:33:20.460 --> 07:33:22.460
Let's go wherever this leads us.

07:33:22.460 --> 07:33:24.460
There's a lot of stuff here.

07:33:24.460 --> 07:33:26.460
What do the people have to say?

07:33:26.460 --> 07:33:27.460
Detour ahead?

07:33:27.460 --> 07:33:29.460
Are you wearing a hole?

07:33:29.460 --> 07:33:30.460
A vision of a hole?

07:33:30.460 --> 07:33:31.460
Oh.

07:33:31.460 --> 07:33:33.460
I found the hole.

07:33:33.460 --> 07:33:35.460
I found it.

07:33:35.460 --> 07:33:38.460
Didn't expect a hole.

07:33:38.460 --> 07:33:40.460
Grass.

07:33:40.460 --> 07:33:45.460
Alright, he's fighting something.

07:33:45.460 --> 07:33:48.460
Isn't this where...

07:33:48.460 --> 07:33:49.460
Wait a second.

07:33:49.460 --> 07:33:52.460
This looks mighty familiar.

07:33:52.460 --> 07:33:56.460
Isn't this where you fight late?

07:33:56.460 --> 07:33:58.460
A question mark?

07:33:58.460 --> 07:34:05.460
At some point?

07:34:05.460 --> 07:34:07.460
I don't know.

07:34:07.460 --> 07:34:08.460
No?

07:34:08.460 --> 07:34:09.460
No?

07:34:09.460 --> 07:34:12.460
It's a different place?

07:34:12.460 --> 07:34:13.460
It's a no-car...

07:34:13.460 --> 07:34:16.460
Oh yeah, you're right, you're right.

07:34:16.460 --> 07:34:17.460
Oh.

07:34:17.460 --> 07:34:20.460
Who the fuck is here then?

07:34:20.460 --> 07:34:21.460
Oh.

07:34:21.460 --> 07:34:22.460
Let's find out.

07:34:22.460 --> 07:34:27.460
Oh, it's...

07:34:27.460 --> 07:34:36.460
Oh, fucking Jesus Christ.

07:34:36.460 --> 07:34:41.460
This is fun.

07:34:41.460 --> 07:34:42.460
Ow.

07:34:42.460 --> 07:34:43.460
Actually...

07:34:43.460 --> 07:34:50.460
No, I'm going to roll into that.

07:34:50.460 --> 07:34:59.460
No, I don't want you to be grabbing his little hands.

07:34:59.460 --> 07:35:09.460
How am I supposed to...?

07:35:09.460 --> 07:35:28.460
Oh, I was hoping it wouldn't be able to hit me.

07:35:28.460 --> 07:35:30.460
Oh fuck, you're over here now.

07:35:30.460 --> 07:35:35.460
Ain't that nice?

07:35:35.460 --> 07:35:37.460
Am I dead?

07:35:37.460 --> 07:35:44.460
I gotta be dead now.

07:35:44.460 --> 07:35:47.460
Grab my little body.

07:35:47.460 --> 07:35:58.460
There really isn't a whole lot of little snakes.

07:35:58.460 --> 07:36:01.460
I hate that they're called abductor.

07:36:01.460 --> 07:36:04.460
I thought it was going to be called abducator.

07:36:04.460 --> 07:36:06.460
I thought everybody was joking.

07:36:06.460 --> 07:36:08.460
Alright, well...

07:36:08.460 --> 07:36:10.460
You gotta say hello.

07:36:10.460 --> 07:36:13.460
Now I know what to expect.

07:36:13.460 --> 07:36:15.460
Look at this little guy.

07:36:15.460 --> 07:36:16.460
They're so cute.

07:36:16.460 --> 07:36:18.460
Truly.

07:36:18.460 --> 07:36:23.460
Well...

07:36:23.460 --> 07:36:25.460
Since there's a hole there...

07:36:25.460 --> 07:36:27.460
I should probably get a fucking flashlight.

07:36:27.460 --> 07:36:30.460
Can I go around it?

07:36:30.460 --> 07:36:33.460
No?

07:36:33.460 --> 07:36:34.460
Yes?

07:36:34.460 --> 07:36:35.460
No?

07:36:35.460 --> 07:36:36.460
Can I go down there?

07:36:36.460 --> 07:36:38.460
Alright, well...

07:36:38.460 --> 07:36:42.460
If you insist.

07:36:42.460 --> 07:36:44.460
What are they weak to?

07:36:44.460 --> 07:36:46.460
Not that I have anything.

07:36:46.460 --> 07:36:49.460
When you're first doing a playthrough and you grab everything

07:36:49.460 --> 07:36:51.460
and you do fucking every little thing,

07:36:51.460 --> 07:36:57.460
you have so many swords and weapons to play with.

07:36:57.460 --> 07:37:00.460
I'm like, ah, they're weak against this?

07:37:00.460 --> 07:37:04.460
Bet, and then I fucking pull that out.

07:37:04.460 --> 07:37:10.460
Did they fight them all the way over here too?

07:37:10.460 --> 07:37:14.460
I'm confused.

07:37:14.460 --> 07:37:15.460
Duck people.

07:37:15.460 --> 07:37:17.460
The hole is the way out.

07:37:17.460 --> 07:37:20.460
Alright.

07:37:20.460 --> 07:37:22.460
Try lightning.

07:37:22.460 --> 07:37:24.460
I don't have any lightning.

07:37:25.460 --> 07:37:27.460
Cough, cough, cough.

07:37:43.460 --> 07:37:46.460
No, no.

07:37:46.460 --> 07:37:49.460
Let me out.

07:37:54.460 --> 07:38:17.460
I literally dodged that.

07:38:17.460 --> 07:38:19.460
What did I mouth you, girl?

07:38:19.460 --> 07:38:25.460
Merging up doctors?

07:38:25.460 --> 07:38:29.460
They're weak when they open?

07:38:29.460 --> 07:38:31.460
I didn't know they were full of snakes.

07:38:31.460 --> 07:38:47.460
They're just a lot of little grabby hands.

07:38:47.460 --> 07:38:56.460
Let's see how they do with the regular magic.

07:38:56.460 --> 07:39:00.460
I know someone said grass, but they're like lily pads.

07:39:00.460 --> 07:39:13.460
Surprise! It's snakes!

07:39:13.460 --> 07:39:20.460
What?

07:39:20.460 --> 07:39:23.460
I wish there was friendly fire on these fucking bitches.

07:39:23.460 --> 07:39:26.460
That would be great.

07:39:26.460 --> 07:39:27.460
No!

07:39:27.460 --> 07:39:29.460
Don't do it, you fucking whore.

07:39:29.460 --> 07:39:35.460
I swear to God.

07:39:35.460 --> 07:39:41.460
No!

07:39:41.460 --> 07:39:51.460
No!

07:39:51.460 --> 07:39:55.460
I'm tired of this, Grandpa.

07:39:55.460 --> 07:40:09.460
What I usually do is I usually get them trapped.

07:40:09.460 --> 07:40:15.460
How did you get up there, bro?

07:40:15.460 --> 07:40:17.460
How did you get up there?

07:40:17.460 --> 07:40:19.460
Oh, perfect.

07:40:19.460 --> 07:40:28.460
Well, never mind.

07:40:28.460 --> 07:40:30.460
Come on!

07:40:30.460 --> 07:40:34.460
Even if I got up there, how are they able to hurt me?

07:40:34.460 --> 07:40:37.460
I didn't know I could throw it upwards.

07:40:37.460 --> 07:40:39.460
Muppet? Yeah, one of it.

07:40:39.460 --> 07:40:41.460
You're a muppet.

07:40:41.460 --> 07:40:53.460
Boy, you built like a muppet.

07:40:53.460 --> 07:40:58.460
Excuse me, sir.

07:40:58.460 --> 07:41:05.460
Boy, you built like a baked bean! A baked bean!

07:41:05.460 --> 07:41:08.460
This is annoying.

07:41:08.460 --> 07:41:11.460
If there was one of them, that would have been fine.

07:41:11.460 --> 07:41:21.460
But the twins makes it a little bit more tricky.

07:41:21.460 --> 07:41:26.460
Stop it!

07:41:26.460 --> 07:41:29.460
And then it becomes fucking impervious.

07:41:29.460 --> 07:41:43.460
And so it's a waste of my fucking stuff.

07:41:43.460 --> 07:41:48.460
Can I see?

07:41:48.460 --> 07:41:50.460
See, it can grab me from here.

07:41:50.460 --> 07:41:52.460
Oh God.

07:41:53.460 --> 07:41:58.460
Jesus.

07:41:58.460 --> 07:42:06.460
This is great.

07:42:06.460 --> 07:42:08.460
Can I have a moment?

07:42:08.460 --> 07:42:32.460
Oh God.

07:42:32.460 --> 07:42:34.460
Oh God.

07:42:34.460 --> 07:42:36.460
What the fuck, bitch?

07:42:36.460 --> 07:42:45.460
Oh, what the fuck, bitch?

07:42:45.460 --> 07:42:54.460
No. No.

07:42:54.460 --> 07:43:08.460
No.

07:43:08.460 --> 07:43:15.460
It looks like I can't get out of here.

07:43:15.460 --> 07:43:17.460
Why are you talking like that?

07:43:17.460 --> 07:43:20.460
Is your E button broken?

07:43:21.460 --> 07:43:35.460
Again, with the homestuck speech.

07:43:35.460 --> 07:43:43.460
You're giving me a stroke.

07:43:43.460 --> 07:43:48.460
Sadly, yes.

07:43:48.460 --> 07:43:58.460
Why don't you just pop the key off and try to fix that?

07:43:58.460 --> 07:44:00.460
I'll buy you.

07:44:00.460 --> 07:44:03.460
I'm back in 2005 and I hate it.

07:44:03.460 --> 07:44:13.460
I know, I feel like I'm reading MySpace.

07:44:13.460 --> 07:44:14.460
Should I?

07:44:14.460 --> 07:44:26.460
They probably won't do shit with the lead.

07:44:26.460 --> 07:44:28.460
Alright, fuck it.

07:44:28.460 --> 07:44:56.460
Oh.

07:44:56.460 --> 07:45:00.460
I was actually working, so I will continue to do that.

07:45:00.460 --> 07:45:02.460
I'll focus on one.

07:45:02.460 --> 07:45:11.460
It's just hard to keep an eye on the other one.

07:45:11.460 --> 07:45:13.460
Yeah, I don't know why you just don't copy-paste ease.

07:45:13.460 --> 07:45:15.460
That's a good point as well.

07:45:15.460 --> 07:45:18.460
Well, that is annoying in like the middle of a sentence.

07:45:18.460 --> 07:45:25.460
I'll be here or something.

07:45:25.460 --> 07:45:27.460
Okay.

07:45:27.460 --> 07:45:30.460
Alright, it doesn't matter.

07:45:30.460 --> 07:45:36.460
A little fire never hurt nobody.

07:45:36.460 --> 07:45:39.460
Visions of hole.

07:45:39.460 --> 07:45:42.460
Chapped humps together to give him an E.

07:45:42.460 --> 07:45:49.460
That's funny.

07:45:49.460 --> 07:45:51.460
I can't even read that.

07:45:51.460 --> 07:45:53.460
What?

07:45:53.460 --> 07:45:55.460
Alright, let's focus on one.

07:45:55.460 --> 07:46:24.460
I'm gonna focus on this one.

07:46:24.460 --> 07:46:30.460
I was drinking!

07:46:30.460 --> 07:46:32.460
This will take a while.

07:46:32.460 --> 07:46:34.460
This will take a while.

07:46:34.460 --> 07:46:44.460
I apologize in advance.

07:46:44.460 --> 07:46:49.460
I just hate it when I have to walk places and do the same fucking thing over and over again.

07:46:49.460 --> 07:46:51.460
Just drop me in front of the thing.

07:46:51.460 --> 07:47:01.460
That's all I ask.

07:47:01.460 --> 07:47:19.460
Are you drinking during a fight?

07:47:19.460 --> 07:47:28.460
Kinda fucked myself as well.

07:47:28.460 --> 07:47:30.460
That's a good point.

07:47:30.460 --> 07:47:47.460
Let me try to see if the jellyfish will take off aggro, but I highly doubt it.

07:47:47.460 --> 07:47:49.460
I'm wondering which one.

07:47:49.460 --> 07:47:54.460
I have the skeleton militiaman ashes.

07:47:54.460 --> 07:47:59.460
I have the jellyfish.

07:47:59.460 --> 07:48:06.460
And then I have the wolves.

07:48:06.460 --> 07:48:08.460
I'm asking the triggers.

07:48:08.460 --> 07:48:20.460
I should grab early.

07:48:20.460 --> 07:48:35.460
It's funny because I instinctively want to do that as if I'm gonna wiggle out.

07:48:35.460 --> 07:48:42.460
Should I grab the jellyfish?

07:48:42.460 --> 07:48:46.460
Oh, master triggers!

07:48:46.460 --> 07:48:48.460
Do it!

07:48:48.460 --> 07:48:50.460
Oh, it kinda worked.

07:48:50.460 --> 07:49:02.460
No, do it again.

07:49:02.460 --> 07:49:04.460
Guys, I don't think this is working.

07:49:04.460 --> 07:49:10.460
Guys, I think I have blood loss.

07:49:10.460 --> 07:49:15.460
I'm starting to forget regular sheevee and getting used to muffin sheevee help.

07:49:15.460 --> 07:49:21.460
It's kinda weird because I just have a weird American flag next to me.

07:49:21.460 --> 07:49:27.460
Luckily, I'm here to talk to you about how you can support our soldiers.

07:49:27.460 --> 07:49:32.460
With my hand up, I'm like, well.

07:49:32.460 --> 07:49:36.460
With war with blah blah blah on the rise.

07:49:36.460 --> 07:49:40.460
It's time to support our soldiers, men.

07:49:40.460 --> 07:49:42.460
You say women should be back in the kitchen?

07:49:42.460 --> 07:49:46.460
You should be enlisting.

07:49:46.460 --> 07:49:48.460
Hello, welcome to...

07:49:48.460 --> 07:49:51.460
Welcome to being a member.

07:49:51.460 --> 07:49:55.460
Delanash!

07:49:55.460 --> 07:49:56.460
Ronnie time?

07:49:56.460 --> 07:50:01.460
What do you mean, Ronnie time?

07:50:03.460 --> 07:50:05.460
Oh, god.

07:50:05.460 --> 07:50:23.460
Can you guys hit each other? That'd be great.

07:50:23.460 --> 07:50:25.460
Oh, hello.

07:50:25.460 --> 07:50:27.460
Hello, nice to see you there.

07:50:56.460 --> 07:51:02.460
Fuck off, bro.

07:51:09.460 --> 07:51:11.460
No.

07:51:14.460 --> 07:51:16.460
I'm dead.

07:51:25.460 --> 07:51:30.460
Close, close.

07:51:30.460 --> 07:51:33.460
Yeah, I need to kill at least one of them and I'll be golden.

07:51:33.460 --> 07:51:39.460
All I have to do is run away from the other one.

07:51:39.460 --> 07:51:49.460
Okay, the sickle one is better to get up and close personal to, in my opinion.

07:51:49.460 --> 07:52:01.460
You...

07:52:01.460 --> 07:52:15.460
Are these the main bosses of volcano manor? I can't remember.

07:52:15.460 --> 07:52:23.460
Oh, this has been fun.

07:52:23.460 --> 07:52:25.460
Like I just flop on the ground.

07:52:25.460 --> 07:52:27.460
No!

07:52:27.460 --> 07:52:33.460
You fucking asshole, he's like, my turn.

07:52:33.460 --> 07:52:35.460
Come here, you.

07:52:35.460 --> 07:52:37.460
You're mine.

07:52:37.460 --> 07:52:43.460
Ha!

07:52:43.460 --> 07:52:48.460
I don't quite understand that.

07:52:48.460 --> 07:52:57.460
No!

07:52:57.460 --> 07:53:01.460
I'm just getting passed around.

07:53:01.460 --> 07:53:05.460
Like I'm at a fucking frat party, what the fuck is this?

07:53:05.460 --> 07:53:11.460
This is stupid.

07:53:11.460 --> 07:53:17.460
I'm mad, but I still got jokes.

07:53:27.460 --> 07:53:29.460
What frat party was this?

07:53:29.460 --> 07:53:31.460
I've never been to a frat party.

07:53:31.460 --> 07:53:37.460
This is just a joke.

07:53:37.460 --> 07:53:43.460
I never went to a actual college, I just did online college.

07:53:43.460 --> 07:53:45.460
Because it's so easy.

07:53:45.460 --> 07:53:57.460
I was working on getting my computer science degree.

07:53:57.460 --> 07:54:03.460
I am stuck.

07:54:03.460 --> 07:54:14.460
No.

07:54:14.460 --> 07:54:32.460
I'm scared of being caught.

07:54:32.460 --> 07:54:42.460
Do you see how he tracks me?

07:54:42.460 --> 07:54:46.460
I need to heal.

07:54:46.460 --> 07:54:48.460
I need to heal again.

07:54:48.460 --> 07:54:53.460
I need to fuck.

07:54:53.460 --> 07:55:01.460
No, I never finished school.

07:55:01.460 --> 07:55:03.460
It's just a pain.

07:55:03.460 --> 07:55:05.460
I didn't like it.

07:55:05.460 --> 07:55:07.460
I didn't like school.

07:55:07.460 --> 07:55:12.460
If anything, I'm considering going back.

07:55:12.460 --> 07:55:16.460
I didn't mean to press that, but it's fine.

07:55:16.460 --> 07:55:22.460
And if anything, making my major psychology or something.

07:55:22.460 --> 07:55:25.460
Or just a liberal art.

07:55:25.460 --> 07:55:33.460
Just because, although, like, I would have made really good money had I stuck with it.

07:55:33.460 --> 07:55:36.460
But I'm like, I enjoyed coding.

07:55:36.460 --> 07:55:40.460
I wanted to be, I wanted to be do front end development.

07:55:40.460 --> 07:55:50.460
Because I really love just making things pretty.

07:55:50.460 --> 07:55:58.460
Now.

07:55:58.460 --> 07:56:04.460
Can I get out of here?

07:56:04.460 --> 07:56:08.460
If I had lightning, this would be great.

07:56:08.460 --> 07:56:11.460
Yeah, happy pork.

07:56:11.460 --> 07:56:13.460
Is the ash of war too much to them?

07:56:13.460 --> 07:56:14.460
I'll try it.

07:56:14.460 --> 07:56:17.460
I didn't try it yet.

07:56:17.460 --> 07:56:25.460
I don't think they're kind of like doesn't really matter with like with magic.

07:56:25.460 --> 07:56:26.460
I tried throwing rocks at them.

07:56:26.460 --> 07:56:36.460
I didn't really do anything.

07:56:36.460 --> 07:56:45.460
I know I never, ever use lightning unless it's against these motherfuckers.

07:56:45.460 --> 07:56:48.460
For everyone, my career for it is mostly high school grads that just buy a school.

07:56:48.460 --> 07:56:49.460
Yeah.

07:56:49.460 --> 07:56:57.460
I just like, because I was in school before I got into the dealer.

07:56:57.460 --> 07:57:02.460
But I was just like, I didn't get out of school because of dealer.

07:57:02.460 --> 07:57:03.460
Don't don't get it twisted.

07:57:03.460 --> 07:57:09.460
It was just that I was already a thing on my mind.

07:57:09.460 --> 07:57:14.460
Oh my fucking God, bro.

07:57:14.460 --> 07:57:15.460
Please.

07:57:15.460 --> 07:57:16.460
Please.

07:57:16.460 --> 07:57:18.460
A camera lock dude.

07:57:18.460 --> 07:57:22.460
I need to not lock my camera.

07:57:22.460 --> 07:57:31.460
But I was already planning on leaving and then kind of, because I had already taken a break for like two months of school.

07:57:31.460 --> 07:57:32.460
And then I was just like, you know what?

07:57:32.460 --> 07:57:34.460
I don't care anymore.

07:57:34.460 --> 07:57:41.460
I have plenty of time to go to school anytime I fucking want.

07:57:41.460 --> 07:57:52.460
I was thinking, like let's say like a bazillion years from now when the dealer isn't around.

07:57:52.460 --> 07:58:06.460
I was thinking, because you know how like, you know how like psychology is very, very important.

07:58:06.460 --> 07:58:15.460
There is no true fucking HR in a Corpo.

07:58:15.460 --> 07:58:16.460
Mental health's important.

07:58:16.460 --> 07:58:30.460
I was wondering if I could market myself as a psychologist for VTubers.

07:58:30.460 --> 07:58:39.460
And be, oh my God, I'm going to die.

07:58:39.460 --> 07:58:43.460
And be like a manager, a psychologist sort of thing.

07:58:43.460 --> 07:58:55.460
I feel like that would be a very sought after thing in the industry.

07:58:55.460 --> 07:58:57.460
What the heck did you back up?

07:58:57.460 --> 07:59:00.460
Whoa.

07:59:00.460 --> 07:59:04.460
Open your little mouth.

07:59:04.460 --> 07:59:12.460
Let me jump out.

07:59:12.460 --> 07:59:17.460
Oh God, hello.

07:59:17.460 --> 07:59:20.460
Oh God, how are you knowing where I'm jumping?

07:59:20.460 --> 07:59:35.460
Oh God, I was hoping you would get stuck behind them so you didn't roll me down.

07:59:35.460 --> 07:59:39.460
Because I'm very in tune with people's emotions.

07:59:39.460 --> 07:59:41.460
And I love, love, love, love psychology.

07:59:41.460 --> 07:59:59.460
And just really finding out like the how's and why's, like why our brain makes specific decisions and kind of how to work things out in a healthy way.

07:59:59.460 --> 08:00:09.460
And because I do have a management background at my last job, I feel like,

08:00:09.460 --> 08:00:17.460
like let's say, let's say like three years from now or whatever,

08:00:17.460 --> 08:00:20.460
Strawny anticipates us to stop having gents.

08:00:20.460 --> 08:00:26.460
Maybe the fourth year I decide to be, I comment on as a talent manager instead of a talent, you know?

08:00:26.460 --> 08:00:27.460
I think that'd be cool.

08:00:27.460 --> 08:00:29.460
Because I'm trying to think of long term.

08:00:29.460 --> 08:00:37.460
You can't be a VTuber forever, sadly, I wish I could.

08:00:37.460 --> 08:00:41.460
And I think that would be pretty violent because there always will be VTubers.

08:00:41.460 --> 08:00:45.460
Like I don't, that won't go away.

08:00:45.460 --> 08:00:47.460
But I think it would be cool.

08:00:47.460 --> 08:00:51.460
Oh my God, please.

08:00:51.460 --> 08:00:53.460
Just give me a chance.

08:00:53.460 --> 08:01:00.460
Just give me a chance.

08:01:00.460 --> 08:01:03.460
But it's like I do have this approach ability.

08:01:03.460 --> 08:01:05.460
I do have this, like I can be professional.

08:01:05.460 --> 08:01:08.460
I want to be.

08:01:08.460 --> 08:01:16.460
I am good in terms of like, I'm good with networking.

08:01:16.460 --> 08:01:18.460
I'm good at connecting with people.

08:01:18.460 --> 08:01:24.460
And I feel like I would benefit a lot of like future YouTubers in no way.

08:01:24.460 --> 08:01:26.460
And especially because I've been part of the industry.

08:01:26.460 --> 08:01:32.460
Again, this is years and years and years and years into the future.

08:01:32.460 --> 08:01:35.460
Because again, I want to make VTuber my full time job right now.

08:01:35.460 --> 08:01:38.460
It's essentially is.

08:01:38.460 --> 08:01:47.460
And so I think it would be pretty cool to do something like that in the future.

08:01:47.460 --> 08:01:54.460
Like to, or like be some sort of social media management, which I never really anticipated for myself before.

08:01:54.460 --> 08:01:59.460
Maybe I'll take a like communications course or something.

08:01:59.460 --> 08:02:02.460
Unironically, you'd be a great mental health professional.

08:02:02.460 --> 08:02:09.460
I don't know why, but hearing that is just really funny.

08:02:09.460 --> 08:02:11.460
I don't know why it's just funny to me.

08:02:11.460 --> 08:02:20.460
Unironically, VTuber, that looks like a Muppet right now, you'd be a really great mental health professional.

08:02:20.460 --> 08:02:21.460
Yeah, exactly.

08:02:21.460 --> 08:02:25.460
So that's why I'm like, okay, after the three gents, because I want to be there.

08:02:25.460 --> 08:02:26.460
I want to be there to help stick out.

08:02:26.460 --> 08:02:29.460
Maybe the third gen, I help mentor.

08:02:29.460 --> 08:02:30.460
I love being a mentor.

08:02:30.460 --> 08:02:31.460
I love teaching.

08:02:31.460 --> 08:02:37.460
I love that sort of stuff.

08:02:37.460 --> 08:02:39.460
Oh, hello.

08:02:39.460 --> 08:02:43.460
Hi.

08:02:43.460 --> 08:02:45.460
Why do you get to clip through each other?

08:02:45.460 --> 08:02:49.460
That's not fair.

08:02:50.460 --> 08:02:51.460
How did you kill me?

08:02:51.460 --> 08:02:55.460
Oh, I thought I was, I never got them in your hitbox.

08:02:55.460 --> 08:02:57.460
You can see the little sneaky poos.

08:02:57.460 --> 08:02:58.460
There.

08:02:58.460 --> 08:03:03.460
Oh, right, it's a little air box.

08:03:03.460 --> 08:03:05.460
A lot of conversations with my sex Muppet.

08:03:05.460 --> 08:03:07.460
It really helped me.

08:03:07.460 --> 08:03:13.460
My psychologist brought up how after I confided them that I wasn't comfy talking to a person, I would honestly be the most helping thing.

08:03:13.460 --> 08:03:14.460
Oh, really?

08:03:14.460 --> 08:03:15.460
You think so?

08:03:15.460 --> 08:03:17.460
That's cute.

08:03:17.460 --> 08:03:23.460
Like, I'm very in touch with my mental health.

08:03:23.460 --> 08:03:27.460
I mean, just dropping a dookie behind me.

08:03:27.460 --> 08:03:28.460
Oh, fuck.

08:03:28.460 --> 08:03:29.460
Oh, fuck.

08:03:29.460 --> 08:03:34.460
I can't get out, guys.

08:03:34.460 --> 08:03:38.460
I'm really in touch with my mental health.

08:03:38.460 --> 08:03:40.460
I see it therapist.

08:03:40.460 --> 08:03:42.460
I think mental health is very important.

08:03:42.460 --> 08:03:46.460
Even if you don't really think you need one, it's always good just to have somebody like every once in a while.

08:03:46.460 --> 08:03:49.460
Like every few months or so.

08:03:49.460 --> 08:03:52.460
In fact, I need to message my therapist back.

08:03:52.460 --> 08:03:56.460
She just came back from vacation.

08:03:56.460 --> 08:04:03.460
It's important to like have somebody bounce off of this like kind of an unbiased third party.

08:04:03.460 --> 08:04:09.460
Kind of help you untangle the yarn that is your mind, you know?

08:04:09.460 --> 08:04:15.460
Coming for you, bro.

08:04:16.460 --> 08:04:19.460
I wish I could get you stuck on something.

08:04:19.460 --> 08:04:20.460
I'm dead already.

08:04:20.460 --> 08:04:22.460
Guys, I don't know.

08:04:22.460 --> 08:04:23.460
This is so annoying.

08:04:23.460 --> 08:04:31.460
This might be a beat-off stream thing again.

08:04:31.460 --> 08:04:32.460
Yeah, outside perspective.

08:04:32.460 --> 08:04:42.460
I've also worked with psychologists and practitioners.

08:04:42.460 --> 08:04:48.460
I just find mental health to be super, super necessary.

08:04:48.460 --> 08:04:59.460
Especially there's not a lot of people that have a focus on mental health that is in regards to people who are social media influencers.

08:04:59.460 --> 08:05:01.460
It's a whole different ballgame.

08:05:01.460 --> 08:05:03.460
You're in the spotlight.

08:05:03.460 --> 08:05:11.460
You are dealing with a different sort of hatred, different sort of comments, different sort of pressure.

08:05:12.460 --> 08:05:19.460
And like you can ask the other girls, I help them work through their shit all the time.

08:05:19.460 --> 08:05:24.460
Not that they have a lot, but just like if they're having a tough time, they talk to me, you know?

08:05:24.460 --> 08:05:31.460
And I can either listen or give you a solution, whatever you want.

08:05:31.460 --> 08:05:33.460
Yeah.

08:05:33.460 --> 08:05:36.460
The only person who can put me down is myself.

08:05:36.460 --> 08:05:40.460
Therapy stream answering mental health related marrows would be really cool actually.

08:05:40.460 --> 08:05:47.460
If I would do that, just because that's a slippery slope, because I'm not a licensed professional.

08:05:47.460 --> 08:05:52.460
I don't want you and people, some of you know would know to take my shit with a grain of salt.

08:05:52.460 --> 08:06:07.460
Others would take it literally and just take my word as Bible, which I don't want.

08:06:07.460 --> 08:06:11.460
That would just be a suggestion. I'm already going to die.

08:06:11.460 --> 08:06:15.460
Can you guys stop? I need you to fuck off.

08:06:15.460 --> 08:06:24.460
Both of you, fuck off. Both of you right now, fuck off.

08:06:24.460 --> 08:06:28.460
You know, no one got me, no psychology major, she got me.

08:06:28.460 --> 08:06:33.460
Um, because I've been a fair, I don't understand how people can do therapy,

08:06:33.460 --> 08:06:38.460
personal health stuff to a stranger seems very daunting, because I've had a fair share of issues.

08:06:38.460 --> 08:06:42.460
I talk with friends and they keep claiming I'm being taken advantage of.

08:06:42.460 --> 08:06:47.460
Oh, because I've had a fair share of issues, like what do you mean?

08:06:47.460 --> 08:06:53.460
Oh wait, this is two different things.

08:06:53.460 --> 08:06:57.460
Therapy, so like I've been in therapy for a very long time.

08:06:57.460 --> 08:07:03.460
I will not lie to you and say, you know, there's a lot of mental health issues running my family,

08:07:03.460 --> 08:07:09.460
but thankfully my parents were, my parents were, oh shit, I'm just going to die.

08:07:09.460 --> 08:07:13.460
Just kill me, just kill me now.

08:07:13.460 --> 08:07:17.460
My parents were very self aware people and they were very open minded.

08:07:17.460 --> 08:07:25.460
Like my parents are not from a generation where they think that mental health is just like get over yourself.

08:07:25.460 --> 08:07:31.460
Which sometimes, you know, sometimes people do need to get over themselves, I won't lie to you.

08:07:31.460 --> 08:07:39.460
So, and I've been to multiple therapists when I was a kid.

08:07:39.460 --> 08:07:44.460
So, because I mentioned to you guys, I have OCD, I also have something called Dermatillomania,

08:07:44.460 --> 08:07:51.460
which is kind of like almost like an offshoot of OCD, where I have this compulsion to pick at my skin,

08:07:51.460 --> 08:07:55.460
because I feel like it's just like, it's a sensory issue for me.

08:07:55.460 --> 08:07:58.460
I don't like when there's a bump, I don't like when there's a scab.

08:07:58.460 --> 08:08:01.460
That's why I relate a lot to Amy when she's like, I love picking my scabs.

08:08:01.460 --> 08:08:04.460
I'm like, oh my god, me too.

08:08:04.460 --> 08:08:08.460
And so I went for that because my parents thought it was a form of self harm.

08:08:08.460 --> 08:08:12.460
It is not, it is literally just almost like an OCD thing.

08:08:13.460 --> 08:08:24.460
Thank you for the tip. Yeah, I'll fix your whole entire life.

08:08:24.460 --> 08:08:30.460
And it took a lot. I remember my first therapist, I didn't say anything to her at all.

08:08:30.460 --> 08:08:34.460
I was like, fuck you, you fucking bitch. I was like 14.

08:08:34.460 --> 08:08:37.460
I'm like, don't talk to me. You don't know anything about me.

08:08:37.460 --> 08:08:42.460
Again, I had lots of bad social anxiety as well.

08:08:55.460 --> 08:08:58.460
I'm stuck. I'm gonna die.

08:09:07.460 --> 08:09:25.460
I should have healed and it takes a lot of trust.

08:09:25.460 --> 08:09:27.460
It takes a lot of repetition.

08:09:27.460 --> 08:09:34.460
It takes, you also have to be in the right mindset to do therapy because you're not.

08:09:34.460 --> 08:09:40.460
The thing looks so fucking funny. It's a little worm.

08:09:40.460 --> 08:09:44.460
It's if you're resistant, it's not going to work out for you.

08:09:44.460 --> 08:09:47.460
Just like, you know, hypnosis or whatever.

08:09:47.460 --> 08:09:50.460
And also the therapist has to be good.

08:09:50.460 --> 08:09:56.460
Like if you go to a therapist and they're like, and how does that make you feel like all fucking stereotypically, don't talk to them.

08:09:56.460 --> 08:09:58.460
They're fucking stupid.

08:09:58.460 --> 08:10:03.460
You want somebody who's going to make you think and going to challenge you and your thought processes.

08:10:03.460 --> 08:10:06.460
And I give a shout out to my therapist for that.

08:10:06.460 --> 08:10:12.460
She fucking bought my merch, I believe, which is hilarious because she was so proud of me because I was telling her.

08:10:12.460 --> 08:10:17.460
She's, again, known me for years, told her how much I wanted to be a VTuber.

08:10:17.460 --> 08:10:20.460
And then it happened and she was so proud.

08:10:20.460 --> 08:10:24.460
She got a little key chain.

08:10:24.460 --> 08:10:31.460
And if I'm feeling a certain type of way, if I'm like, oh, I interacted with this person

08:10:31.460 --> 08:10:36.460
and it was not a good interaction, she's just like, why was it a bad interaction?

08:10:36.460 --> 08:10:39.460
Why, why did you react?

08:10:39.460 --> 08:10:42.460
Why do you think you reacted the way you did?

08:10:42.460 --> 08:10:49.460
What may have caused you like it's just more deeper questions and like, how did that make you feel?

08:10:49.460 --> 08:10:58.460
Because and then I also like people be like, oh, if you go to a therapist, you know, eventually have to stop because then it's then they're just taking advantage of you.

08:10:58.460 --> 08:11:01.460
It's not working anymore.

08:11:01.460 --> 08:11:02.460
Again, it's personal preference.

08:11:02.460 --> 08:11:04.460
You don't have to see one.

08:11:04.460 --> 08:11:11.460
If you don't think talking will help you that it probably won't because talk therapy is a form of therapy.

08:11:11.460 --> 08:11:20.460
It's like there's so many other forms of therapy out there besides just talk therapy.

08:11:20.460 --> 08:11:21.460
It's helpful.

08:11:21.460 --> 08:11:25.460
It's helpful to kind of figure out who you are.

08:11:25.460 --> 08:11:27.460
Again, from an unbiased perspective.

08:11:27.460 --> 08:11:35.460
Then again, there are some very toxic therapists out there who have maybe gotten into it for your own gain.

08:11:35.460 --> 08:11:39.460
That's why it's important to shop around.

08:11:39.460 --> 08:11:49.460
I would say for for one because the first one I remember I went to she was just absolutely fucking off.

08:11:49.460 --> 08:11:56.460
It was monotonous that type of like, how does that make you feel?

08:11:56.460 --> 08:12:00.460
And she didn't take me seriously.

08:12:00.460 --> 08:12:02.460
And I told my parents like, I don't think I don't like this lady.

08:12:02.460 --> 08:12:04.460
And then I went to another one.

08:12:04.460 --> 08:12:10.460
And then she kind of just felt like I felt sorry, smack my microphone accident.

08:12:10.460 --> 08:12:15.460
I felt like she was being really condescending.

08:12:15.460 --> 08:12:20.460
And again, I'm like 14 and I am aware that someone's patronizing me.

08:12:20.460 --> 08:12:23.460
You know, it's bad because usually when you're a kid, you're like, oh, they're supposed to be talking to me like this.

08:12:23.460 --> 08:12:26.460
But no, it was just like, I didn't feel good.

08:12:26.460 --> 08:12:37.460
And I felt like I wasn't getting anywhere because like I was still I was still picking my skin pretty bad.

08:12:37.460 --> 08:12:40.460
My mom was actually like, I had a dermatologist.

08:12:40.460 --> 08:12:42.460
No, no, I had a fucking esthetician.

08:12:42.460 --> 08:12:47.460
It's someone who like does like your skincare and stuff like this when you go to a spa.

08:12:47.460 --> 08:12:49.460
Oh, that's like the simplest way I can put it.

08:12:49.460 --> 08:12:51.460
Hi, Rena.

08:12:51.460 --> 08:13:02.460
And my esthetician was giving me more information about mental stuff and dermatolomania than my own that my own therapist was, which was so funny to me.

08:13:02.460 --> 08:13:04.460
She's like, oh, I've seen this before.

08:13:04.460 --> 08:13:06.460
It's very common in women.

08:13:06.460 --> 08:13:07.460
I'm like, what?

08:13:07.460 --> 08:13:08.460
She's like, yeah.

08:13:08.460 --> 08:13:14.460
You know, the best thing to do is to work on your skincare rather than and then the mental health second.

08:13:14.460 --> 08:13:24.460
Because if you can prevent the stuff from popping up and protect your skin from like accidentally getting hurt or vice versa, then you can almost fight the urge or you can wear gloves.

08:13:24.460 --> 08:13:28.460
And I was like, this lady was pouring so so much fucking information on me.

08:13:28.460 --> 08:13:31.460
And I was like, damn, whereas my therapist was just absolutely useless.

08:13:31.460 --> 08:13:33.460
And now I have a new one.

08:13:34.460 --> 08:13:35.460
Rena, what are you doing?

08:13:35.460 --> 08:13:38.460
She's like, she's sitting on me funny.

08:13:38.460 --> 08:13:39.460
Hi, Rena.

08:13:42.460 --> 08:13:44.460
But yeah, do you want to ask for you?

08:13:44.460 --> 08:13:46.460
You don't have to do it, obviously.

08:13:46.460 --> 08:13:52.460
I went to a therapist and I kept asking questions about my daily schedule instead of the issues I faced in my life and kids for three sessions.

08:13:52.460 --> 08:13:54.460
And I felt like that wasn't the best way to therapy.

08:13:54.460 --> 08:13:56.460
And then you had to tell him that.

08:13:56.460 --> 08:13:58.460
You got to tell him that.

08:13:59.460 --> 08:14:02.460
It's literally you have to be honest.

08:14:02.460 --> 08:14:05.460
It's hard, but you have to be if you're going to get anywhere.

08:14:07.460 --> 08:14:12.460
Parsing your emotions into comprehensible words or thoughts seems to be quite a large part of their.

08:14:12.460 --> 08:14:13.460
Yes, exactly.

08:14:13.460 --> 08:14:15.460
Because like, I remember.

08:14:19.460 --> 08:14:22.460
So like, I've told you guys, I have a lot of religious trauma.

08:14:22.460 --> 08:14:25.460
Ever been a really religious household.

08:14:26.460 --> 08:14:35.460
And I was, as you guys know, I'm kind of drawn to more esoteric things because they just feel better for me.

08:14:35.460 --> 08:14:40.460
And I kind of delved into that with my therapist.

08:14:40.460 --> 08:14:46.460
And she's like, I think you're doing this and you're doing this sort of stuff because you weren't allowed to before.

08:14:46.460 --> 08:14:49.460
And you're feeling rebellious because you weren't allowed to rebel when you're younger.

08:14:49.460 --> 08:14:51.460
And I'm like, holy shit, you're right.

08:14:51.460 --> 08:14:54.460
That's the only reason I was drawn to it.

08:14:54.460 --> 08:14:56.460
It's because it was forbidden.

08:14:56.460 --> 08:15:03.460
Sort of like esoteric, pagan, sort of like tarot card read in shit.

08:15:03.460 --> 08:15:06.460
Because it's like, you know, growing up like it's demonic.

08:15:06.460 --> 08:15:09.460
And I'm like, it was an active rebellion of me participating in it.

08:15:09.460 --> 08:15:12.460
And that's why that's that's literally why I do it.

08:15:12.460 --> 08:15:13.460
100%.

08:15:13.460 --> 08:15:23.460
And it took therapy for me to realize that instead of just me being like, yes, rocks, crystals, frequencies.

08:15:25.460 --> 08:15:27.460
Yeah, psychologist is not a doctor.

08:15:27.460 --> 08:15:33.460
There's also a difference between a psychologist, a therapist, and a psychiatrist.

08:15:33.460 --> 08:15:36.460
They are different things.

08:15:36.460 --> 08:15:38.460
How does this do an eczema?

08:15:38.460 --> 08:15:39.460
Some days it gets super bad.

08:15:39.460 --> 08:15:41.460
Taking skin, lots of cocoa butter lotion.

08:15:41.460 --> 08:15:43.460
Yeah, exactly.

08:15:43.460 --> 08:15:49.460
And then, yeah, with my dermatolomaniac, I had even like a sort of body dysmorphia.

08:15:49.460 --> 08:15:52.460
Because I always felt like something was wrong.

08:15:52.460 --> 08:15:55.460
If something was on my skin, it was very weird.

08:15:58.460 --> 08:16:01.460
It's like those chiropractor videos where the girl starts crying from the stress release

08:16:01.460 --> 08:16:04.460
and the doctor stops her from apologizing and crying and reassures her.

08:16:04.460 --> 08:16:05.460
Yeah.

08:16:05.460 --> 08:16:09.460
Like, there are things you kind of like talk about and you're like, holy shit, wait.

08:16:09.460 --> 08:16:11.460
That makes so much sense.

08:16:11.460 --> 08:16:13.460
It just took to talking to somebody else.

08:16:13.460 --> 08:16:17.460
The reason why I go to a therapist and the reason why I don't talk to like friends about stuff.

08:16:17.460 --> 08:16:18.460
Well, I do.

08:16:18.460 --> 08:16:19.460
I do.

08:16:19.460 --> 08:16:22.460
One of the reasons is because everybody has something going on.

08:16:22.460 --> 08:16:25.460
You know, everybody has something going on.

08:16:25.460 --> 08:16:31.460
You don't want to kind of dump stuff on people if you don't know.

08:16:31.460 --> 08:16:35.460
And so I pick and choose my moments where I share things with friends and where, you know,

08:16:35.460 --> 08:16:39.460
I just go to a licensed professional who's paid to listen to me, you know, trauma dump,

08:16:39.460 --> 08:16:46.460
you know, because like I've been the person and I never minded this that at my last job,

08:16:46.460 --> 08:16:47.460
everybody went to you.

08:16:47.460 --> 08:16:51.460
Again, I was seen as the big sister.

08:16:51.460 --> 08:17:05.460
I was seen as the person that everybody wanted me to help fix their issues or like give them advice.

08:17:05.460 --> 08:17:06.460
Oh, God.

08:17:06.460 --> 08:17:08.460
Oh, God.

08:17:08.460 --> 08:17:10.460
Oh, hey.

08:17:10.460 --> 08:17:12.460
Let me just a little slappy slap.

08:17:12.460 --> 08:17:14.460
Damn it.

08:17:14.460 --> 08:17:18.460
Ow.

08:17:18.460 --> 08:17:25.460
Raina, you're on my arm and I can't really play.

08:17:25.460 --> 08:17:28.460
And even customers again would tell me really deep things.

08:17:28.460 --> 08:17:31.460
Like again, I've had customers telling me like, oh, my husband passed away recently.

08:17:31.460 --> 08:17:32.460
I'm buying this.

08:17:32.460 --> 08:17:34.460
Remember this of him.

08:17:34.460 --> 08:17:37.460
I'm getting this fixed because this and this happened.

08:17:37.460 --> 08:17:38.460
I lost a kid.

08:17:38.460 --> 08:17:41.460
This happened.

08:17:41.460 --> 08:17:43.460
My child doesn't speak to me anymore.

08:17:43.460 --> 08:17:45.460
This isn't that.

08:17:45.460 --> 08:17:49.460
Or just like my co-workers personal lives.

08:17:49.460 --> 08:17:56.460
And it was a lot, but I can compartmentalize that stuff.

08:17:56.460 --> 08:17:59.460
But at some point, you know, it does become mentally exhausting.

08:17:59.460 --> 08:18:05.460
And that's why it's important not to tax your friends with that stuff.

08:18:05.460 --> 08:18:08.460
And it's also important when your friend is venting to you.

08:18:08.460 --> 08:18:16.460
And I learned this from one of my co-workers who is talking to me about his wife.

08:18:16.460 --> 08:18:19.460
He was just like, I love my wife so much.

08:18:19.460 --> 08:18:21.460
She's the great, we have amazing communication and blah, blah, blah.

08:18:21.460 --> 08:18:25.460
I don't know why I pressed that.

08:18:25.460 --> 08:18:37.460
But he said, always ask when someone is asking you for help or venting to you if they want a solution.

08:18:38.460 --> 08:18:43.460
Or if they want just to vent.

08:18:43.460 --> 08:18:50.460
Because sometimes people say things to you.

08:18:50.460 --> 08:18:52.460
Come back here.

08:18:52.460 --> 08:18:55.460
Damn it.

08:18:55.460 --> 08:19:02.460
Open up.

08:19:02.460 --> 08:19:05.460
Really, he backs up sometimes.

08:19:05.460 --> 08:19:15.460
Where am I?

08:19:15.460 --> 08:19:20.460
Because you don't want to start, somebody's venting to you and then you just start telling them what they should be doing.

08:19:20.460 --> 08:19:25.460
It's not going to do anything for them.

08:19:25.460 --> 08:19:30.460
Damn, I was close for that one.

08:19:30.460 --> 08:19:32.460
It's really not.

08:19:32.460 --> 08:19:37.460
They're not going to listen to you because they just think you're just wordbombing on them.

08:19:37.460 --> 08:19:44.460
Shibi, how do I recover from the trauma of recommending someone a show and they don't watch it until someone else recommends it to them?

08:19:44.460 --> 08:19:48.460
If that's true, I'll be real with you.

08:19:48.460 --> 08:19:58.460
They probably don't value your opinion as much as they should.

08:19:58.460 --> 08:20:08.460
Or they want multiple people to reassure them that's the right decision and that's on them, that's not on you.

08:20:08.460 --> 08:20:12.460
A show, by the way, now I want to know.

08:20:12.460 --> 08:20:20.460
With that, would you add to have understanding of a person who tells you they can't help you with right now because they have stuff going on and you have to respect that as a person?

08:20:20.460 --> 08:20:22.460
Exactly.

08:20:22.460 --> 08:20:27.460
Sometimes I would have one of my friends come up to me and be like, hey, can I talk to you about something?

08:20:27.460 --> 08:20:30.460
And I'm like, I'm sorry, I generally just don't have the mental capacity for that right now.

08:20:30.460 --> 08:20:31.460
And they're like, okay, I understand.

08:20:31.460 --> 08:20:33.460
I'm like, don't take it, please don't take it personally.

08:20:33.460 --> 08:20:34.460
I have my own stuff going on.

08:20:34.460 --> 08:20:37.460
Please tell me in like a day.

08:20:37.460 --> 08:20:38.460
And then I got you.

08:20:38.460 --> 08:20:46.460
Oh, fuck.

08:20:46.460 --> 08:20:51.460
Okay, Rena, you're on my arm and I can't move that well.

08:20:52.460 --> 08:20:53.460
I'll take the first answer.

08:20:53.460 --> 08:20:57.460
Thank you.

08:20:57.460 --> 08:20:58.460
Yeah.

08:20:58.460 --> 08:20:59.460
Do you want someone to talk to you?

08:20:59.460 --> 08:21:00.460
Someone to vent to?

08:21:00.460 --> 08:21:05.460
Yeah.

08:21:05.460 --> 08:21:10.460
I think the second venting versus finding solutions is something that drives my mom up the wall when I try to help.

08:21:10.460 --> 08:21:14.460
Yeah.

08:21:14.460 --> 08:21:20.460
Like, and I, and I had to tell my parents that too.

08:21:20.460 --> 08:21:28.460
Because again, like, you're still your parents, you're still like their kid and whatever.

08:21:28.460 --> 08:21:33.460
And I remember I would talk to my mom and my mom would just try to give me advice.

08:21:33.460 --> 08:21:36.460
And I'm like, that's not, I just want to talk to you right now.

08:21:36.460 --> 08:21:39.460
You know, I don't want, I'm not looking for advice.

08:21:39.460 --> 08:21:40.460
I know what I'm supposed to be doing.

08:21:40.460 --> 08:21:43.460
I just need to talk about it.

08:21:43.460 --> 08:21:55.460
And then when I trust that to her, she then she started to really, really listen to me a lot more and then our relationship got better.

08:21:55.460 --> 08:22:04.460
Jesus, I can't dodge right now.

08:22:04.460 --> 08:22:07.460
Oh, God.

08:22:07.460 --> 08:22:09.460
I'm already almost dead.

08:22:09.460 --> 08:22:10.460
I hate them so much.

08:22:10.460 --> 08:22:12.460
I don't have to beat them off stream.

08:22:12.460 --> 08:22:18.460
100% boundaries are very important.

08:22:18.460 --> 08:22:23.460
It's a very important, but it's also like, nobody's going to know what you're thinking unless you say it.

08:22:23.460 --> 08:22:31.460
You know, if you, if somebody slights you and you feel fronted and you start like, don't be passive aggressive.

08:22:31.460 --> 08:22:34.460
That's not the, you're an adult.

08:22:34.460 --> 08:22:35.460
You talk to them.

08:22:35.460 --> 08:22:39.460
You say, Hey, I have an issue with how you approach this.

08:22:39.460 --> 08:22:42.460
That's the type of person that I am.

08:22:42.460 --> 08:22:52.460
If I never got into fights with anybody, one, because I was tall and people were intimidated by my height.

08:22:52.460 --> 08:23:00.460
And two, because the moment I heard that something was wrong, that somebody was just like, Oh, so and so is talking shit about you.

08:23:00.460 --> 08:23:02.460
This is like high school, by the way.

08:23:02.460 --> 08:23:04.460
I immediately go to the person to be like, Hey, what's up?

08:23:04.460 --> 08:23:06.460
Snip this in the butt.

08:23:06.460 --> 08:23:08.460
What's going on?

08:23:08.460 --> 08:23:09.460
So I don't fuck with that.

08:23:09.460 --> 08:23:12.460
I don't fuck with that.

08:23:12.460 --> 08:23:17.460
I don't need the extra silliness, you know.

08:23:17.460 --> 08:23:18.460
Nobody does.

08:23:18.460 --> 08:23:26.460
Nobody needs extra silliness.

08:23:26.460 --> 08:23:27.460
Die.

08:23:27.460 --> 08:23:28.460
Die.

08:23:28.460 --> 08:23:29.460
Die.

08:23:29.460 --> 08:23:30.460
Oh.

08:23:30.460 --> 08:23:32.460
I got grabbed by the other one.

08:23:32.460 --> 08:23:40.460
Are you serious, bro?

08:23:40.460 --> 08:23:46.460
Oh my God.

08:23:46.460 --> 08:23:49.460
This isn't fair.

08:23:49.460 --> 08:23:50.460
They lining up on you.

08:23:50.460 --> 08:23:57.460
I'm getting a train in on me by these abducer, abductor virgins.

08:23:57.460 --> 08:23:59.460
But yeah.

08:23:59.460 --> 08:24:02.460
Chiwi's in a yapping mood, not a slapping mood.

08:24:02.460 --> 08:24:03.460
And boss is on the worst.

08:24:03.460 --> 08:24:04.460
They really are, though.

08:24:04.460 --> 08:24:05.460
Hello.

08:24:05.460 --> 08:24:06.460
Hello.

08:24:06.460 --> 08:24:07.460
Welcome in.

08:24:07.460 --> 08:24:09.460
No one has the same sphere of knowledge.

08:24:09.460 --> 08:24:11.460
Most problems stem from assumption.

08:24:11.460 --> 08:24:12.460
Exactly.

08:24:12.460 --> 08:24:21.460
And this is what, and this is kind of what bothers me about being the VTB community, because again, everything's online.

08:24:21.460 --> 08:24:25.460
People usually talk over DMs.

08:24:25.460 --> 08:24:26.460
And this hasn't happened to me or anything, by the way.

08:24:26.460 --> 08:24:31.460
It's just something I've observed.

08:24:31.460 --> 08:24:44.460
I see that so there's so many miscommunications, so much drama that comes off of things that could be easily spoken over to in a call.

08:24:44.460 --> 08:24:53.460
And also people just taking something too far just for the sake of it, because they get some sort of adrenaline after participating in drama, you know.

08:24:53.460 --> 08:25:00.460
And people also just like, they've been like assumptions a lot in VTB.

08:25:00.460 --> 08:25:08.460
That's kind of to be expected, though, because you kind of, how could you not assume things, you know?

08:25:08.460 --> 08:25:11.460
Oh, please.

08:25:11.460 --> 08:25:13.460
I need to get them away from each other.

08:25:13.460 --> 08:25:16.460
That's what I need to do.

08:25:16.460 --> 08:25:20.460
Get a trainer and on you by virgins in the wild.

08:25:20.460 --> 08:25:23.460
It has to be relic of football.

08:25:23.460 --> 08:25:30.460
One thing that drives me nuts is when everyone has a problem that needs fixing and talk around in circles and wants to do instead of humming about it.

08:25:30.460 --> 08:25:31.460
Very true.

08:25:31.460 --> 08:25:36.460
Again, actions speak louder than words.

08:25:36.460 --> 08:25:38.460
You just want to do something.

08:25:38.460 --> 08:25:39.460
If you see something's wrong, just do it.

08:25:39.460 --> 08:25:41.460
Just like, just act on it.

08:25:41.460 --> 08:25:43.460
If necessary, you know, ask for permission.

08:25:43.460 --> 08:25:47.460
If you need to be like, hey, when you have this conversation, I would like to have this conversation with you.

08:25:47.460 --> 08:25:50.460
Are you able to have it right now?

08:25:50.460 --> 08:25:57.460
And also know that everybody has different ways of receiving feedback.

08:25:57.460 --> 08:26:01.460
Some people want it told to them straight.

08:26:01.460 --> 08:26:04.460
And some people need, they can't handle that.

08:26:04.460 --> 08:26:08.460
Like, I'm the type of person.

08:26:08.460 --> 08:26:11.460
And me and my dad the exact same way.

08:26:11.460 --> 08:26:16.460
Like, and my mom knew how to handle me better because how much I'm similar to my dad.

08:26:16.460 --> 08:26:19.460
But like, so my mom is the type of person.

08:26:19.460 --> 08:26:26.460
So if you get into, if you get into like a little scuffle, a little kerfuffle with her, she needs to talk about it immediately.

08:26:26.460 --> 08:26:33.460
Which is what I've learned to do is actually, as I've had it, I've hit a balance with the saving it for later and talking about it immediately.

08:26:33.460 --> 08:26:40.460
But my dad's the type of person where he needs to kind of think about stuff and come back to it.

08:26:40.460 --> 08:26:50.460
Everybody talks and communicates differently and you, there's nothing wrong with asking a person how they communicate, you know?

08:26:50.460 --> 08:26:57.460
If someone's just like, I would like to be very blunt with me, then be blunt with them.

08:26:57.460 --> 08:27:03.460
If someone's like, I can't handle that and I need to think about stuff for a little bit, then respect them.

08:27:03.460 --> 08:27:05.460
Respect their respect that.

08:27:05.460 --> 08:27:09.460
Because eventually you'll get to the solution you need to.

08:27:09.460 --> 08:27:13.460
Oh, fuck. I thought I was going to dodge in time.

08:27:13.460 --> 08:27:16.460
Look at them hold. They're waiting for me.

08:27:16.460 --> 08:27:18.460
Irina.

08:27:22.460 --> 08:27:28.460
Perfect example. The roof is leaking. We need to fix. We have no money, so I propose you put a tarp outside the roof.

08:27:28.460 --> 08:27:35.460
No, it's, no, it's too much money. Okay, a few months later, the roof is sacking from water damage.

08:27:35.460 --> 08:27:37.460
Yup.

08:27:37.460 --> 08:27:43.460
It's also like, it's a slippery slope because everybody has a different opinion. Everybody has a different solution on how they want to do things.

08:27:43.460 --> 08:27:56.460
And it's kind of up to the group, excuse me, how they, how they want to have a compromise to fix it, you know?

08:27:56.460 --> 08:28:00.460
Again, that's all it comes down to communication, communication, communication, communication.

08:28:00.460 --> 08:28:16.460
This goes for normal relationships too. They'll be your parents, your friends, your spouse, your boyfriends, girlfriends, situationships.

08:28:16.460 --> 08:28:21.460
I've learned a lot from my therapist in general because I'll ask her questions. He's very open.

08:28:21.460 --> 08:28:30.460
And I'll be like, how would you approach someone like this? Because I'll, you know, I'll vent to people venting to me to be like, hey, this person told me this, what the fuck do I do about it?

08:28:30.460 --> 08:28:41.460
Like one of my coworkers is being harassed by someone and I'm like, how the fuck do I approach this? And then she's like, well, go to HR and I'm like, well, yeah, but like, what else?

08:28:41.460 --> 08:28:51.460
I wish I could parry that somehow.

08:28:51.460 --> 08:29:04.460
Okay, I don't think I'm getting a lot of volcano mirror anytime soon. I don't think I might just get those dectas medallions.

08:29:04.460 --> 08:29:26.460
You die the behind your time when the name seems to abduct your chats. And every problem needs an immediate resolution, but it does need a solution. Yes, a very good friend taught me that.

08:29:26.460 --> 08:29:31.460
Oh, man, I'm crying. I'm fucking crying. I hate this muppet. Oh, why are you crying? Oh, don't cry.

08:29:31.460 --> 08:29:33.460
You don't cry.

08:29:33.460 --> 08:29:42.460
Person who over things in a combo. So I'm not sure how best to communicate. Just say that. Just say that. Just tell people, hey, I tend to overthink a lot.

08:29:42.460 --> 08:29:59.460
I need you to reassure me or I need you to be very explicit with me what you're trying to say. Like I need you to really be blunt in order for me to understand because I'm going to overthink it.

08:29:59.460 --> 08:30:05.460
Because I know I do that sometimes. Again, I'm not a perfect person. I'm not a perfect muppet.

08:30:05.460 --> 08:30:18.460
Somebody tells me something and my mind's going a thousand miles per hour. It was a porn hour. Why do people fight over here, by the way? I'm kind of confused by that. What's over here?

08:30:26.460 --> 08:30:28.460
Why are so many people dying over here?

08:30:36.460 --> 08:30:40.460
I'm a little confused.

08:30:40.460 --> 08:30:44.460
Maybe invasions. Oh, that makes sense.

08:30:44.460 --> 08:30:50.460
I spammed buttons to break out. It's not working.

08:30:50.460 --> 08:30:56.460
I know they're weak to electric. I don't have anything electric for them.

08:30:57.460 --> 08:31:06.460
I could try to craft some electric shit.

08:31:06.460 --> 08:31:16.460
My health is too low. What are you talking about? Who are you? Get out of here. Nobody asked you to speak.

08:31:16.460 --> 08:31:25.460
Cookbook search? Yeah, I'm thinking I might need to get a lightning cookbook out of the fuck it's called.

08:31:25.460 --> 08:31:27.460
Wait.

08:31:27.460 --> 08:31:34.460
Can I knock it out of here? Okay, I can. Thank God.

08:31:34.460 --> 08:31:41.460
I'm wondering if there probably isn't another way for me to get out.

08:31:41.460 --> 08:31:45.460
What was I going to do?

08:31:45.460 --> 08:31:48.460
I'm going to get out of here.

08:31:48.460 --> 08:32:00.460
What was I going to do?

08:32:00.460 --> 08:32:10.460
Gally haven't been to the plateau yet? No, because I'm going to fucking these motherfuckers for an hour or two.

08:32:10.460 --> 08:32:15.460
I just beat Rinala.

08:32:15.460 --> 08:32:20.460
I need to get to the fucking plateau so I can get to Radon.

08:32:20.460 --> 08:32:28.460
But these bitches are in the way.

08:32:28.460 --> 08:32:37.460
If they hardlocked me in there, I would brute force it off stream. Don't even worry about it. Just like I did with the worm.

08:32:37.460 --> 08:32:42.460
But yeah, I hope you guys kind of get what I'm saying.

08:32:42.460 --> 08:32:47.460
I like being real with you guys sometimes.

08:32:47.460 --> 08:32:52.460
Where is the nearest lightning fucking cookbook?

08:32:52.460 --> 08:32:58.460
I often catch astrophys when I text people and they don't respond quickly and chatting in the stream has actually been helping me get over that a bit.

08:32:58.460 --> 08:33:05.460
That's good. That's good. I get that. Sometimes if people don't respond right away, I'm like they hate me.

08:33:06.460 --> 08:33:14.460
I said something to her the other day and she just totally ignored it.

08:33:14.460 --> 08:33:16.460
She hates me.

08:33:16.460 --> 08:33:20.460
And then literally like five minutes later, she's like, I'm so sorry I didn't see this.

08:33:20.460 --> 08:33:26.460
I'm so sorry. She's profusely apologizing.

08:33:26.460 --> 08:33:33.460
And then sometimes our minds tend to stretch things.

08:33:33.460 --> 08:33:36.460
You too, Shibi.

08:33:40.460 --> 08:33:45.460
You also have to think about people have other lives. They have stuff to do. They got stuff going on.

08:33:45.460 --> 08:33:49.460
And sometimes I'll be honest with you. Sometimes I don't feel like responding to people.

08:33:49.460 --> 08:33:55.460
Sometimes I'm just peopled out and I just don't feel like talking.

08:33:56.460 --> 08:34:06.460
Sometimes people will text me and I will leave them unread because I'm just not mentally equipped to talk to somebody right now.

08:34:09.460 --> 08:34:11.460
What? Mesh bat and blast.

08:34:11.460 --> 08:34:15.460
Get me out. Get me out. Get me out. Get me out. I'm dead.

08:34:15.460 --> 08:34:17.460
As it doesn't work.

08:34:20.460 --> 08:34:23.460
And again, are you like two different time zooms? Exactly. That's not a factor.

08:34:24.460 --> 08:34:26.460
There's so many different factors.

08:34:26.460 --> 08:34:29.460
Remember how Mercy explained she didn't think she got in.

08:34:29.460 --> 08:34:32.460
So she messaged Stroni and she was like, oh, you're actually in.

08:34:32.460 --> 08:34:34.460
Should you be like that?

08:34:37.460 --> 08:34:40.460
And then it's also to talk to personalities.

08:34:40.460 --> 08:34:42.460
Stroni's a little forgetful.

08:34:42.460 --> 08:34:45.460
And again, also different time zones.

08:34:45.460 --> 08:34:48.460
I'm tired of tired of doing this.

08:34:54.460 --> 08:34:58.460
I've tried to stream until Mercy comes on.

08:34:58.460 --> 08:35:00.460
It's not going to read into her.

08:35:00.460 --> 08:35:02.460
I don't remember what she's doing today.

08:35:02.460 --> 08:35:05.460
I haven't looked at the schedule. I need to work on my schedule for next week.

08:35:05.460 --> 08:35:07.460
Happy 4th of July!

08:35:09.460 --> 08:35:13.460
The book is in the Wyndham.

08:35:13.460 --> 08:35:14.460
Wyndham.

08:35:14.460 --> 08:35:16.460
Catacombs.

08:35:17.460 --> 08:35:19.460
Is there still streaming?

08:35:19.460 --> 08:35:21.460
Yeah, I wanted to.

08:35:21.460 --> 08:35:22.460
I didn't even know.

08:35:22.460 --> 08:35:24.460
I haven't looked at any of the schedules today.

08:35:24.460 --> 08:35:26.460
I didn't see know who was streaming.

08:35:26.460 --> 08:35:28.460
Streaming Super Mario RPG.

08:35:28.460 --> 08:35:31.460
Send a message to my friend who's on vacation on WhatsApp today.

08:35:31.460 --> 08:35:33.460
And he didn't answer it.

08:35:33.460 --> 08:35:35.460
And I remembered he just doesn't have WhatsApp anymore.

08:35:35.460 --> 08:35:36.460
That too.

08:35:36.460 --> 08:35:37.460
It's just like...

08:35:37.460 --> 08:35:39.460
Or people have really bad reception.

08:35:40.460 --> 08:35:42.460
You know?

08:35:48.460 --> 08:35:50.460
Fuck you.

08:35:51.460 --> 08:35:53.460
Fuck you.

08:35:57.460 --> 08:35:58.460
I don't like you.

08:35:58.460 --> 08:36:00.460
Why does there have to be two of you?

08:36:06.460 --> 08:36:07.460
Maybe another play.

08:36:07.460 --> 08:36:09.460
I'm not doing that.

08:36:12.460 --> 08:36:14.460
Yeah, we're streaming up next to mine.

08:36:14.460 --> 08:36:16.460
Thank you for your support, everybody.

08:36:16.460 --> 08:36:18.460
I really appreciate that.

08:36:19.460 --> 08:36:21.460
Um...

08:36:23.460 --> 08:36:24.460
Yeah.

08:36:25.460 --> 08:36:27.460
A lot of things could be solved.

08:36:29.460 --> 08:36:32.460
If people just communicated or weren't scared to.

08:36:33.460 --> 08:36:35.460
Then people have reasons to be scared to.

08:36:35.460 --> 08:36:37.460
Which you know, you can't blame them for it all.

08:36:38.460 --> 08:36:41.460
You want to just gap for the rest of the stream and you beat them off stream?

08:36:41.460 --> 08:36:42.460
I might do that.

08:36:42.460 --> 08:36:47.460
I'm gonna keep talking and fight them half-handedly.

08:36:47.460 --> 08:36:49.460
Half-heartedly, but yeah.

08:36:53.460 --> 08:36:55.460
What if I do?

08:37:01.460 --> 08:37:04.460
Maybe the wolfies will distract them.

08:37:06.460 --> 08:37:08.460
Because they'll be bouncing around.

08:37:17.460 --> 08:37:18.460
Yeah.

08:37:32.460 --> 08:37:34.460
Trying to grab the dogs.

08:37:43.460 --> 08:37:45.460
Dogs are actually helping.

08:37:48.460 --> 08:37:49.460
Oh.

08:37:54.460 --> 08:37:55.460
I'm dead.

08:37:55.460 --> 08:37:56.460
Oh, not dead.

08:38:04.460 --> 08:38:05.460
I'm almost dead.

08:38:06.460 --> 08:38:07.460
No!

08:38:12.460 --> 08:38:13.460
No!

08:38:13.460 --> 08:38:14.460
Oh, he grabbed me.

08:38:18.460 --> 08:38:20.460
I don't know if there's a stat spread.

08:38:20.460 --> 08:38:22.460
Um, I'll show you in a second.

08:38:25.460 --> 08:38:28.460
Do you not zoom in on the fucking virgin crotch?

08:38:28.460 --> 08:38:29.460
It's kind of weird.

08:38:31.460 --> 08:38:33.460
Am I scared to communicate?

08:38:33.460 --> 08:38:34.460
You just suck at it.

08:38:34.460 --> 08:38:35.460
But why?

08:38:35.460 --> 08:38:36.460
Why do you think you suck at it?

08:38:36.460 --> 08:38:38.460
Why do you think you suck at communicating?

08:38:41.460 --> 08:38:42.460
You know?

08:38:43.460 --> 08:38:45.460
Do you think, do you like stutter?

08:38:45.460 --> 08:38:47.460
Do you think you can't form your words properly?

08:38:47.460 --> 08:38:49.460
Okay, what can you do to fix that?

08:38:49.460 --> 08:38:50.460
You know?

08:38:53.460 --> 08:38:55.460
I practice a lot of shit in the mirror.

08:38:55.460 --> 08:38:58.460
Honestly, streaming helps a lot with me talking.

08:39:02.460 --> 08:39:04.460
Then again, I worked in customer service,

08:39:04.460 --> 08:39:05.460
but I had to address a lot of people,

08:39:05.460 --> 08:39:07.460
so that was also a big help.

08:39:07.460 --> 08:39:09.460
Otherwise, I couldn't talk at all.

08:39:09.460 --> 08:39:11.460
I was almost like a fucking slut.

08:39:11.460 --> 08:39:14.460
I was select to mute for a little bit when I was younger.

08:39:16.460 --> 08:39:20.460
Going back to the thing about your esthetician,

08:39:20.460 --> 08:39:21.460
knowing more about your therapist,

08:39:21.460 --> 08:39:23.460
I teach my doctor about HRT

08:39:23.460 --> 08:39:26.460
and provide him with my own research in order to get HRT.

08:39:26.460 --> 08:39:28.460
That's when you go to a different doctor, though.

08:39:28.460 --> 08:39:31.460
You want to go to a doctor that specializes in what you know.

08:39:31.460 --> 08:39:34.460
You have to, you cannot just stay with a doctor

08:39:34.460 --> 08:39:36.460
because it's familiar, you know?

08:39:39.460 --> 08:39:42.460
I had to go to many different doctors

08:39:42.460 --> 08:39:46.460
in order to figure out my fibromyalgia diagnosis,

08:39:46.460 --> 08:39:48.460
and I'm still fighting for that.

08:39:50.460 --> 08:39:53.460
It's officially recognized by state shit,

08:39:53.460 --> 08:39:57.460
just like how Nikki Ray from Idol is dealing with it.

08:39:57.460 --> 08:40:00.460
She just finally got approved for disability and stuff,

08:40:00.460 --> 08:40:02.460
and I'm like, fuck props to her.

08:40:02.460 --> 08:40:05.460
I want to do a fundraising thing with her at some point for fibro.

08:40:05.460 --> 08:40:06.460
That would be amazing.

08:40:06.460 --> 08:40:08.460
I'm definitely going to reach out to her about that.

08:40:08.460 --> 08:40:10.460
She said it'd be cool.

08:40:11.460 --> 08:40:13.460
I saw your communication.

08:40:13.460 --> 08:40:15.460
I keep going.

08:40:15.460 --> 08:40:20.460
Sometimes I just have trouble turning thoughts into words.

08:40:22.460 --> 08:40:25.460
Then, you know, I think to fix that,

08:40:25.460 --> 08:40:29.460
well, not to fix it, but like to practice to improve.

08:40:29.460 --> 08:40:31.460
Just say what's on your mind,

08:40:31.460 --> 08:40:33.460
not to anyone in particular.

08:40:33.460 --> 08:40:35.460
Just like talk to yourself.

08:40:37.460 --> 08:40:39.460
I talk to myself a lot.

08:40:40.460 --> 08:40:42.460
It would have been a year-long wait to see a specialist

08:40:42.460 --> 08:40:44.460
going to wait that long.

08:40:44.460 --> 08:40:48.460
But don't you want to wait for the best type of care

08:40:48.460 --> 08:40:50.460
that you want to get?

08:40:50.460 --> 08:40:52.460
I understand.

08:40:52.460 --> 08:40:55.460
Obviously, I don't know your circumstance.

08:40:55.460 --> 08:41:00.460
You 100% can't wait.

08:41:00.460 --> 08:41:04.460
And clearly, if your doctor is willing to learn

08:41:04.460 --> 08:41:07.460
and willing to be more open-minded about that sort of thing,

08:41:07.460 --> 08:41:09.460
then, of course, try to push the subject,

08:41:09.460 --> 08:41:11.460
and you did, and it worked out.

08:41:11.460 --> 08:41:13.460
Sometimes it's not a luxury.

08:41:13.460 --> 08:41:15.460
So I'm like, hey, it doesn't work out.

08:41:15.460 --> 08:41:16.460
Fuck them.

08:41:16.460 --> 08:41:18.460
Fuck them and run.

08:41:18.460 --> 08:41:20.460
Now, I'm almost dead.

08:41:22.460 --> 08:41:27.460
Can you like just give me just a second?

08:41:29.460 --> 08:41:31.460
Okay, who is going to be distracted?

08:41:31.460 --> 08:41:33.460
You are.

08:41:34.460 --> 08:41:39.460
I'm dead.

08:41:49.460 --> 08:41:52.460
I sadly damage my voice from being in a high school metal band.

08:41:52.460 --> 08:41:53.460
I can't raise my voice.

08:41:53.460 --> 08:41:54.460
It's got more painful as I got older,

08:41:54.460 --> 08:41:56.460
and it's infuriating when people tell me to raise my voice.

08:41:56.460 --> 08:41:57.460
I'm like, that sucks.

08:41:57.460 --> 08:41:59.460
I'm so sorry about that.

08:42:00.460 --> 08:42:03.460
I know, like, I would love to learn how to scream,

08:42:03.460 --> 08:42:06.460
but, again, it does strain your voice,

08:42:06.460 --> 08:42:09.460
and you have to really learn how to do it properly.

08:42:12.460 --> 08:42:15.460
And that's like, you know, speech therapy.

08:42:15.460 --> 08:42:19.460
It's hard when you damage your voice like that.

08:42:21.460 --> 08:42:24.460
And, again, you don't want to have to keep explaining to people

08:42:24.460 --> 08:42:28.460
the reason why you can't, you know.

08:42:30.460 --> 08:42:31.460
That sucks.

08:42:31.460 --> 08:42:33.460
I'm really sorry about that.

08:42:33.460 --> 08:42:35.460
I had to go through so many doctors and specialists

08:42:35.460 --> 08:42:37.460
for my health issues, even with good insurance.

08:42:37.460 --> 08:42:39.460
So many doctors wanted to avoid any actual tests

08:42:39.460 --> 08:42:41.460
to help figure out what the issue was.

08:42:41.460 --> 08:42:43.460
I feel that's so hard.

08:42:43.460 --> 08:42:44.460
I feel that's so hard.

08:42:44.460 --> 08:42:48.460
You do not know how much money I am medically in debt

08:42:48.460 --> 08:42:51.460
because I'm seeing specialists after specialists,

08:42:51.460 --> 08:42:53.460
not even just for fibro,

08:42:53.460 --> 08:42:57.460
but for, like, skin stuff, mental health stuff,

08:42:57.460 --> 08:43:00.460
physical stuff, physical therapy.

08:43:03.460 --> 08:43:04.460
So much shit.

08:43:06.460 --> 08:43:07.460
So much stupid shit.

08:43:07.460 --> 08:43:09.460
Oh, God, I should have done this earlier.

08:43:12.460 --> 08:43:13.460
All right.

08:43:13.460 --> 08:43:14.460
Now I'm down the road.

08:43:15.460 --> 08:43:16.460
Hey, man.

08:43:16.460 --> 08:43:18.460
I'm gonna kill you.

08:43:22.460 --> 08:43:24.460
I hope you keep a good eye on me.

08:43:25.460 --> 08:43:26.460
Yeah.

08:43:34.460 --> 08:43:37.460
When I was younger, I always felt like I had a mask,

08:43:37.460 --> 08:43:38.460
never saying what I was thinking,

08:43:38.460 --> 08:43:40.460
but after shedding a few years ago,

08:43:40.460 --> 08:43:43.460
communication is so much easier and we weren't fulfilling.

08:43:43.460 --> 08:43:46.460
I am actually still struggling with that to this day.

08:43:46.460 --> 08:43:48.460
I 100% mask.

08:43:48.460 --> 08:43:51.460
I didn't know how much I masked

08:43:51.460 --> 08:43:56.460
because growing up, again, very religious,

08:43:56.460 --> 08:43:59.460
there was different expectations on behavior.

08:43:59.460 --> 08:44:06.460
And so I would change my behavior so I could fit in so much.

08:44:06.460 --> 08:44:12.460
And only, like, in the past few years, have I really realized

08:44:15.460 --> 08:44:17.460
how much I hide, how I am.

08:44:17.460 --> 08:44:20.460
And even, like, something that stuck out to me,

08:44:20.460 --> 08:44:22.460
when I was starting VTubing,

08:44:22.460 --> 08:44:24.460
is someone said to me,

08:44:24.460 --> 08:44:27.460
I can tell she's not being herself.

08:44:27.460 --> 08:44:30.460
I can tell she's hiding herself.

08:44:30.460 --> 08:44:34.460
And then my goal was to, if anything,

08:44:34.460 --> 08:44:36.460
I should be my true self on the internet.

08:44:36.460 --> 08:44:38.460
Nobody knows what the fuck I am, you know?

08:44:38.460 --> 08:44:40.460
So much anonymity.

08:44:40.460 --> 08:44:43.460
I shouldn't have to worry about that shit, you know?

08:44:43.460 --> 08:44:45.460
You know?

08:44:49.460 --> 08:44:51.460
Alrighty.

08:44:51.460 --> 08:44:54.460
Grab my party divide.

08:44:54.460 --> 08:44:59.460
But yeah, and then that's why I'm working,

08:44:59.460 --> 08:45:02.460
because I realize, like, I stim, I repeat stuff,

08:45:02.460 --> 08:45:05.460
I have echolalia, I have a bunch of other shit.

08:45:05.460 --> 08:45:07.460
Again, I'm no professional.

08:45:07.460 --> 08:45:10.460
I'm not a huge fan of how some people self-diagnose,

08:45:10.460 --> 08:45:13.460
you know, sometimes the first step in getting to an actual diagnosis

08:45:13.460 --> 08:45:16.460
is a self-diagnosis within reason, of course.

08:45:16.460 --> 08:45:20.460
The people who go on and say that they have fucking alters and DID

08:45:20.460 --> 08:45:25.460
piss me the fuck off, because it takes away

08:45:25.460 --> 08:45:27.460
from the people who actually have the issue

08:45:27.460 --> 08:45:29.460
and makes them seem less serious.

08:45:29.460 --> 08:45:32.460
That is one of my least favorite things.

08:45:32.460 --> 08:45:36.460
I think they have some, it's a pet peeve of mine.

08:45:37.460 --> 08:45:41.460
As someone I have worked in human services,

08:45:41.460 --> 08:45:45.460
I took care of adults with mental and physical disabilities

08:45:45.460 --> 08:45:49.460
and behavioral issues, and people pretending to go

08:45:49.460 --> 08:45:53.460
what people go through as a little quirk pisses me the fuck off,

08:45:53.460 --> 08:45:55.460
because they have no fucking idea.

08:45:55.460 --> 08:45:58.460
They have no idea what the fuck I work with.

08:45:59.460 --> 08:46:06.460
One of my people I took care of had schizophrenia.

08:46:06.460 --> 08:46:09.460
She was one of the sweetest people in the world.

08:46:09.460 --> 08:46:12.460
She passed away recently, it was really sad.

08:46:12.460 --> 08:46:17.460
I still have a playlist I made around my phone.

08:46:17.460 --> 08:46:22.460
It's time to get a little emotional and think about her.

08:46:22.460 --> 08:46:27.460
And then people just pretending to be quirky

08:46:27.460 --> 08:46:29.460
with schizophrenia and stuff.

08:46:29.460 --> 08:46:31.460
They're like, oh yeah, I talk to people.

08:46:31.460 --> 08:46:32.460
There's people there.

08:46:32.460 --> 08:46:34.460
I'm like, are you fucking stupid?

08:46:34.460 --> 08:46:38.460
You have no idea what people struggle with.

08:46:40.460 --> 08:46:43.460
I feel like I'm a lot like myself now.

08:46:45.460 --> 08:46:49.460
My alter is minor in internet celebrity, oh brother.

08:46:50.460 --> 08:46:53.460
It's like, no, you're just weird and you have a tulpa.

08:46:57.460 --> 08:46:58.460
It's that kind of stuff.

08:46:58.460 --> 08:47:00.460
That's why I'm very wary.

08:47:00.460 --> 08:47:05.460
People be like, oh, my chat will joke when I was written up

08:47:05.460 --> 08:47:11.460
that I was autistic and that I have ADHD.

08:47:11.460 --> 08:47:14.460
And I'm like, no, I don't.

08:47:14.460 --> 08:47:18.460
And now I'm reconsidering.

08:47:18.460 --> 08:47:19.460
I don't have autism.

08:47:19.460 --> 08:47:22.460
I know I don't fucking have autism.

08:47:22.460 --> 08:47:26.460
But now I'm reconsidering if I have adult ADHD.

08:47:26.460 --> 08:47:29.460
And I'm just like, huh, I do experience a lot of these symptoms.

08:47:29.460 --> 08:47:32.460
I thought they were OCD related, but they're not.

08:47:32.460 --> 08:47:34.460
Maybe I should look into that.

08:47:34.460 --> 08:47:36.460
There's nothing wrong with that.

08:47:36.460 --> 08:47:40.460
And I'll make jokes about it like, ah, sorry, it's my ADHD.

08:47:40.460 --> 08:47:44.460
But I also say I don't fucking have it officially diagnosed.

08:47:44.460 --> 08:47:50.460
But I also don't make it a part of my personality.

08:47:50.460 --> 08:47:56.460
And some people do that are self-diagnosed.

08:47:58.460 --> 08:48:01.460
I don't like when people make labels as part of their personality.

08:48:01.460 --> 08:48:03.460
You're so much more than that, you know?

08:48:03.460 --> 08:48:05.460
So much more than that.

08:48:05.460 --> 08:48:19.460
So many different other facets to your being besides your mental illnesses,

08:48:19.460 --> 08:48:22.460
what you identify as, who you love.

08:48:22.460 --> 08:48:28.460
Not that those things don't matter, because they do.

08:48:28.460 --> 08:48:30.460
They're also a big part of you.

08:48:31.460 --> 08:48:33.460
But yeah.

08:48:42.460 --> 08:48:44.460
I have a friend in BPD.

08:48:44.460 --> 08:48:45.460
She's such an amazing person.

08:48:45.460 --> 08:48:46.460
Yeah.

08:48:46.460 --> 08:48:48.460
People at BPD have a bad rap.

08:48:51.460 --> 08:48:53.460
I'll be honest with you.

08:48:53.460 --> 08:48:58.460
I had a former friend of mine that had BPD.

08:48:58.460 --> 08:49:05.460
And she blew her whole entire life up, which was sad to see.

08:49:05.460 --> 08:49:15.460
It was really tough watching her blow up her life like that just for attention.

08:49:15.460 --> 08:49:17.460
Because she wasn't getting the help that she needed.

08:49:17.460 --> 08:49:18.460
She wasn't seeing anybody.

08:49:18.460 --> 08:49:21.460
She wasn't seeing a specialist.

08:49:21.460 --> 08:49:26.460
That's the type of thing you need to see someone for.

08:49:26.460 --> 08:49:27.460
She didn't.

08:49:27.460 --> 08:49:29.460
And she, you know, ruined a lot of friendships.

08:49:29.460 --> 08:49:34.460
I had to disengage with her because I supported her on something.

08:49:34.460 --> 08:49:38.460
Then, you know, it was all just for attention and it really sucked.

08:49:38.460 --> 08:49:42.460
This was a deep issue.

08:49:42.460 --> 08:49:46.460
But they are amazing people when treated.

08:49:46.460 --> 08:49:50.460
When you're properly medicated, you're taking care of yourself.

08:49:50.460 --> 08:49:54.460
That's so important.

08:49:54.460 --> 08:49:55.460
I miss them truly.

08:49:55.460 --> 08:50:03.460
And people, but also there's another thing of people who use their mental illness as an excuse for bad behavior.

08:50:03.460 --> 08:50:07.460
I think I have like a, I took like a picture of a quote.

08:50:07.460 --> 08:50:18.460
I forget how it goes, but it was just like, just, yes, it can contribute to it, but you can't.

08:50:18.460 --> 08:50:21.460
Having a mental illness doesn't make you a shitty person.

08:50:21.460 --> 08:50:26.460
That's how you handle it or something like that.

08:50:26.460 --> 08:50:31.460
If I'm in here, pretend to have mental disabilities for pity points and Perky dealing with them gave me so much trust all the time.

08:50:31.460 --> 08:50:33.460
Yeah, definitely.

08:50:33.460 --> 08:50:34.460
True.

08:50:34.460 --> 08:50:37.460
I get the sense that folks who self-diagnose these conditions just seek their feeling of importance through it.

08:50:37.460 --> 08:50:44.460
It's also just like, it's a sense of belonging.

08:50:44.460 --> 08:50:45.460
Excuse me.

08:50:45.460 --> 08:50:50.460
It's a sense of belonging because you see it a lot on like social media.

08:50:50.460 --> 08:50:53.460
People want to be a part of something.

08:50:53.460 --> 08:50:55.460
Want to be proud of something.

08:50:55.460 --> 08:50:56.460
They want to feel included.

08:50:56.460 --> 08:50:57.460
They want to feel in a group.

08:50:57.460 --> 08:51:00.460
There's nothing wrong with that.

08:51:00.460 --> 08:51:11.460
But it might be the detriment of others that you proclaim that you're something that you're not just so you can feel like you need to fit into a more quirky label, which is unnecessary.

08:51:11.460 --> 08:51:19.460
You know, especially with kids, kids feel like the kids are so pressured to feel like they have to fit in.

08:51:19.460 --> 08:51:40.460
I know I like for one of my and also you just sometimes you do it just to be liked by like if you if you look up to someone or if you admire someone or you want to be friends with someone, you'll try to relate with them.

08:51:40.460 --> 08:51:52.460
And so sometimes you might kind of try to adopt their personality traits or things that they, you know, struggle with so you can have that common ground.

08:51:52.460 --> 08:51:54.460
I didn't find out I had ADHD until last year.

08:51:54.460 --> 08:51:55.460
I explained a lot.

08:51:55.460 --> 08:51:57.460
Yeah.

08:51:57.460 --> 08:52:00.460
MPPD can be life ruining if you don't properly get help.

08:52:00.460 --> 08:52:01.460
Truly sad.

08:52:01.460 --> 08:52:02.460
Very true.

08:52:02.460 --> 08:52:05.460
A lot of things can be a lot of things can be life ruining if not properly treated.

08:52:05.460 --> 08:52:09.460
That's why it's so important to be on top of your mental health.

08:52:09.460 --> 08:52:15.460
That's why, again, self-diagnosing is important in certain contexts.

08:52:15.460 --> 08:52:19.460
If you think you're a danger to yourself or others, seek help.

08:52:19.460 --> 08:52:21.460
100%.

08:52:22.460 --> 08:52:29.460
Self-destructive behavior is always so sad, especially when you know how somebody is when they're not manic.

08:52:29.460 --> 08:52:36.460
They're just kind of like balanced and they, you know, plateaued and normal, normal tempo or whatever.

08:52:36.460 --> 08:52:41.460
Only people realize that simply asking for attention is not a bad thing.

08:52:41.460 --> 08:52:43.460
That's true.

08:52:43.460 --> 08:52:49.460
It's like it sucks though because there's always people that will like respond negatively to anything that you say.

08:52:49.460 --> 08:52:54.460
Like I totally respect your opinion if you don't agree with me with anything I've just said for the past like two hours.

08:52:54.460 --> 08:52:57.460
That's totally fine.

08:52:57.460 --> 08:53:05.460
But then somebody might be like, hey, I would like some attention and someone would be like, oh, so you're just a fucking pick me or something.

08:53:05.460 --> 08:53:07.460
Like I'm just giving an example.

08:53:07.460 --> 08:53:12.460
So somebody that always like do that and that's where it gets tricky.

08:53:12.460 --> 08:53:19.460
There's, oh, there's sometimes people are negative to be negative.

08:53:19.460 --> 08:53:24.460
That's why trust and, you know, having your guard up is important some of the time.

08:53:24.460 --> 08:53:33.460
You want to be careful, protect your feelings first and foremost, you know.

08:53:33.460 --> 08:53:36.460
I just thought of the marina and the diamonds.

08:53:36.460 --> 08:53:38.460
Fucking lyric.

08:53:38.460 --> 08:53:40.460
Don't wear your heart on your sleeve.

08:53:40.460 --> 08:53:42.460
Wear it on your cheek.

08:53:42.460 --> 08:53:44.460
Look at the marina and the diamonds.

08:53:48.460 --> 08:53:50.460
These are scenes for that goth emo punk.

08:53:50.460 --> 08:53:55.460
Now it's I have DID, I have ADHD.

08:53:55.460 --> 08:54:03.460
I am this form of this identity.

08:54:03.460 --> 08:54:09.460
It's very interesting how people, that's such a, that actually just brought something to my attention.

08:54:09.460 --> 08:54:18.460
It used to be like clicks in terms of, yeah, goth emo punk, jock, popular, nerdy, artistic, like it was that.

08:54:18.460 --> 08:54:20.460
And now it's something else.

08:54:20.460 --> 08:54:26.460
It's become more innate personality traits that you don't outwardly show your, it's your inside now.

08:54:26.460 --> 08:54:27.460
That's so interesting to me.

08:54:27.460 --> 08:54:31.460
I just realized that.

08:54:31.460 --> 08:54:34.460
How, how now that's how groups are formed.

08:54:34.460 --> 08:54:37.460
Because nobody cares anymore.

08:54:37.460 --> 08:54:45.460
Like I'll see like, like my cousins, like my cousin, my little cousin, he plays soccer.

08:54:45.460 --> 08:54:47.460
But he's also a big nerd.

08:54:47.460 --> 08:54:49.460
He's also really good at academics.

08:54:49.460 --> 08:54:53.460
He's less Pokemon.

08:54:53.460 --> 08:54:56.460
Someone's car alarm is going off outside.

08:54:56.460 --> 08:55:01.460
But he'll still hang out with like other nerdy kids or like the super, like, he'll sing out with the artistic kids.

08:55:01.460 --> 08:55:03.460
Like that doesn't matter anymore.

08:55:03.460 --> 08:55:05.460
Which is kind of cool.

08:55:05.460 --> 08:55:11.460
Because now it's like, it's all chopped up to now you bond with people who have shared your same like headspace kind of thought process.

08:55:11.460 --> 08:55:14.460
There's nothing wrong with that.

08:55:14.460 --> 08:55:18.460
Everything can become a little easier when you stop and talk 100%.

08:55:18.460 --> 08:55:20.460
Golf is just not a scene.

08:55:20.460 --> 08:55:23.460
It's a lifestyle.

08:55:23.460 --> 08:55:30.460
I feel like people aren't self diagnosing as all these things though, just certain internet circles 100%.

08:55:30.460 --> 08:55:41.460
Yeah, it's not like, I don't see a people's life self diagnosing quirkly as BPD.

08:55:41.460 --> 08:55:45.460
It's really, it's like, what, what is the fad?

08:55:45.460 --> 08:55:49.460
And I would say, honestly, that's like, that's ADHD now.

08:55:49.460 --> 08:55:53.460
That's why I'm wary to say if I have that or not, because I don't want to seem like that.

08:55:53.460 --> 08:55:59.460
Because I don't know, I'm not officially diagnosed, you know, I'm not trying to do it to fit in with people.

08:55:59.460 --> 08:56:06.460
I figure like, get the right medication so I can get shit done.

08:56:06.460 --> 08:56:20.460
Because sometimes like for me, I only seek a diagnosis or I seek to understand a diagnosis or symptoms if I feel like it pertains to me.

08:56:20.460 --> 08:56:26.460
Like, I personally feel like right now my medication isn't working in terms of my attention span.

08:56:26.460 --> 08:56:30.460
I cannot focus sometimes, unless I'm really interested in something.

08:56:30.460 --> 08:56:36.460
That's why I can stream for long periods of time because it's B2B is my special interest.

08:56:36.460 --> 08:56:39.460
But if I have to do like housework, I'm procrastinating.

08:56:39.460 --> 08:56:41.460
I'm also, I can't sleep because my mind keeps going.

08:56:41.460 --> 08:56:43.460
It's going boom, boom, boom, boom.

08:56:43.460 --> 08:56:46.460
I can't even, I'll be doing certain things.

08:56:46.460 --> 08:56:47.460
Certain things bother me.

08:56:47.460 --> 08:56:51.460
I have some sensory issues and I feel like I've never really noticed that before.

08:56:51.460 --> 08:56:58.460
You know, my parents told me to get over it or that I'm being dramatic or something.

08:56:58.460 --> 08:57:04.460
And that's, and then I'm like, oh, you know, maybe I need to look at my medication.

08:57:04.460 --> 08:57:05.460
Maybe I need to look at my diagnosis.

08:57:05.460 --> 08:57:12.460
Maybe I just, you know, misdiagnosis exists, you know.

08:57:12.460 --> 08:57:16.460
Yeah.

08:57:16.460 --> 08:57:17.460
Following this Elden Rings theory session.

08:57:17.460 --> 08:57:18.460
Yeah, it's really interesting.

08:57:18.460 --> 08:57:20.460
I always like talking about this sort of stuff.

08:57:20.460 --> 08:57:28.460
I'm very, I love talking and thinking about how people work, how society works.

08:57:28.460 --> 08:57:29.460
I also like philosophy.

08:57:29.460 --> 08:57:35.460
So if you ever want to philosophize, is that a word?

08:57:35.460 --> 08:57:42.460
I am down for that.

08:57:42.460 --> 08:57:43.460
I'm never getting diagnosed.

08:57:43.460 --> 08:57:46.460
I got to keep everybody guessing.

08:57:46.460 --> 08:57:47.460
I think maybe that's how I want to be.

08:57:47.460 --> 08:57:50.460
Maybe I want, I think I might follow your example.

08:57:50.460 --> 08:57:53.460
Yeah, when you start to notice the thing when it's like, oh, I think I do have it.

08:57:53.460 --> 08:57:55.460
Yeah, like, it was so funny.

08:57:55.460 --> 08:58:02.460
You know that there's like that one, there is, so I was doing, when I was Rina, I think

08:58:02.460 --> 08:58:05.460
I was doing like a slime ASMR or something.

08:58:05.460 --> 08:58:08.460
I forget, like an actual slime ASMR.

08:58:08.460 --> 08:58:16.460
Everybody calm down and someone was just like, I am literally on the autism spectrum and

08:58:16.460 --> 08:58:19.460
I think you are higher up there than me or lower than me.

08:58:19.460 --> 08:58:20.460
And I'm like, what?

08:58:20.460 --> 08:58:21.460
You're kidding.

08:58:21.460 --> 08:58:23.460
And they're like, go ahead, take a test online.

08:58:23.460 --> 08:58:26.460
I'm like, what actual fucking test is there online?

08:58:26.460 --> 08:58:31.460
I don't believe any of that bullshit online test taking.

08:58:31.460 --> 08:58:36.460
There is a test they use as a guideline I discovered from this person that was in my chat.

08:58:36.460 --> 08:58:40.460
It's called the RADS or the RAS, I don't know, RADS test.

08:58:40.460 --> 08:58:48.460
I took it, I scored like 120, which is high indications of autism.

08:58:48.460 --> 08:58:51.460
Well, not high, more like medium indications.

08:58:51.460 --> 08:58:52.460
That kind of made me wonder.

08:58:52.460 --> 08:58:58.460
I'm just like, okay, should I be looking into this now?

08:58:58.460 --> 08:59:04.460
Because I'm realizing that I do do things a little bit weirdly, not weirdly.

08:59:04.460 --> 08:59:09.460
Actually, I'll take that back a little differently with other people.

08:59:10.460 --> 08:59:11.460
120 plus plus.

08:59:11.460 --> 08:59:13.460
I think it was out of 240.

08:59:13.460 --> 08:59:15.460
So I was like, I was in the middle of the road.

08:59:15.460 --> 08:59:16.460
It was bad.

08:59:16.460 --> 08:59:17.460
It was funny.

08:59:17.460 --> 08:59:21.460
I got my coworkers to do a network because I'm like, hey, let's try it.

08:59:21.460 --> 08:59:27.460
And then this one dude scored super high and he's like normally very quiet.

08:59:27.460 --> 08:59:29.460
And he really likes music.

08:59:29.460 --> 08:59:33.460
He doesn't really talk to a lot of people in my impulsive ass.

08:59:33.460 --> 08:59:36.460
He scored like, I think like 240.

08:59:36.460 --> 08:59:42.460
I just went, oh, that explains a lot in my, in my, in Salem cause she, cause I used to

08:59:42.460 --> 08:59:43.460
work with her.

08:59:43.460 --> 08:59:44.460
She's my one of my best friends.

08:59:44.460 --> 08:59:49.460
She's fucking like hit me in the arm so hard and gave me such a look.

08:59:49.460 --> 08:59:50.460
I'm like, I'm sorry.

08:59:50.460 --> 08:59:53.460
I didn't mean to say that out loud.

08:59:53.460 --> 08:59:54.460
Yeah, exactly.

08:59:54.460 --> 08:59:56.460
They share a lot of traits and symptoms.

08:59:56.460 --> 08:59:58.460
That's why I'm like, okay, maybe I should look at that.

08:59:58.460 --> 09:00:00.460
Maybe I should look at that.

09:00:00.460 --> 09:00:04.460
And then I'm even telling my dad to look at it.

09:00:04.460 --> 09:00:06.460
Cause again, me and my dad are like, I'm a clone of my father.

09:00:06.460 --> 09:00:12.460
I just have boobs and I'm not bald cause my dad is bald dude.

09:00:12.460 --> 09:00:14.460
And I'm like, dad, I think you should consider this too.

09:00:14.460 --> 09:00:23.460
Cause we both have like, I know my dad is learning a lot about his mental health through me cause we are so similar.

09:00:23.460 --> 09:00:31.460
In terms of like, he is realizing he also has really bad things with change and adjustment.

09:00:31.460 --> 09:00:36.460
And that we both like are very childlike sometimes like in goofy.

09:00:36.460 --> 09:00:38.460
My mom was like, my mom always complains.

09:00:38.460 --> 09:00:43.460
Sometimes she's just like, sometimes even your dad would argue like your brother and sister.

09:00:43.460 --> 09:00:46.460
Cause my dad would just be a goofy.

09:00:46.460 --> 09:00:48.460
And I love him for that.

09:00:48.460 --> 09:00:50.460
He's a great dad.

09:00:50.460 --> 09:00:51.460
I said was like he's dead.

09:00:51.460 --> 09:00:53.460
He is a great dad.

09:00:53.460 --> 09:01:00.460
My mom's awesome too for putting up with our bullshit.

09:01:00.460 --> 09:01:04.460
Um, yeah, diagnosed or not, people always compare me to forest comp.

09:01:04.460 --> 09:01:06.460
I didn't know what they meant until I watched it.

09:01:06.460 --> 09:01:11.460
Oh, but he's such a sweetheart though.

09:01:11.460 --> 09:01:13.460
Such a sweetheart.

09:01:13.460 --> 09:01:14.460
I'm so thankful.

09:01:14.460 --> 09:01:17.460
So like, again, I, like I mentioned, I worked in human services.

09:01:17.460 --> 09:01:20.460
Um, did that for six years.

09:01:20.460 --> 09:01:27.460
And I've also had been growing up around like the disabled population for a long time because my dad worked in the industry.

09:01:27.460 --> 09:01:38.460
And so like one of my best friends growing up was literally a woman who was at her time at the time was I believe in her late.

09:01:38.460 --> 09:01:39.460
No, not really.

09:01:39.460 --> 09:01:40.460
Yeah.

09:01:40.460 --> 09:01:41.460
Her late twenties.

09:01:41.460 --> 09:01:45.460
She had the mentality of like a 13 year old that we would hang out all the time.

09:01:45.460 --> 09:01:47.460
It was great.

09:01:47.460 --> 09:01:49.460
And it just normalized it for me.

09:01:49.460 --> 09:01:53.460
Like that, you know, people have different stuff going on.

09:01:53.460 --> 09:01:56.460
And like there are people like, again, I told you, like I worked with somebody that gets schizophrenia.

09:01:56.460 --> 09:02:00.460
She was there at the time too, because I worked at the same place my dad did.

09:02:00.460 --> 09:02:08.460
And there are folks who had like, you know, different behavioral issues, autism, Down syndrome.

09:02:08.460 --> 09:02:11.460
And so kind of just normalized it for me.

09:02:11.460 --> 09:02:17.460
And I was kind of just like under more understanding and I'm very thankful for that.

09:02:17.460 --> 09:02:19.460
Very thankful for that.

09:02:19.460 --> 09:02:24.460
Because I know some people don't know how to act around that population.

09:02:24.460 --> 09:02:30.460
You know, they're, you know, they're just like, you know, experiencing a little bit differently.

09:02:30.460 --> 09:02:33.460
Ow.

09:02:37.460 --> 09:02:39.460
You guys saw that.

09:02:39.460 --> 09:02:43.460
You guys saw I jumped out of the way and it still grabbed me anyways.

09:02:43.460 --> 09:02:46.460
That's so funny.

09:02:46.460 --> 09:02:50.460
How the fuck did that clip through them?

09:02:50.460 --> 09:02:52.460
These are unique in their own ways.

09:02:52.460 --> 09:02:54.460
Anyone to understand that? Exactly.

09:02:54.460 --> 09:02:59.460
That's why I'm a very kind of open-minded and accepting person.

09:02:59.460 --> 09:03:01.460
Yeah.

09:03:01.460 --> 09:03:02.460
They're cheating. They are cheating.

09:03:02.460 --> 09:03:04.460
I swear to God, they're cheating.

09:03:04.460 --> 09:03:05.460
They have hacks.

09:03:05.460 --> 09:03:07.460
They're clipping through shit.

09:03:07.460 --> 09:03:12.460
One of them is wall hacks.

09:03:13.460 --> 09:03:16.460
Oh, well, I'm just gonna die then.

09:03:16.460 --> 09:03:18.460
I'll kill you.

09:03:27.460 --> 09:03:31.460
Yes, after working with a lot of people with different mental disabilities and afflictions,

09:03:31.460 --> 09:03:33.460
I think it really makes you approach people and consider them differently.

09:03:33.460 --> 09:03:36.460
Of course, especially. Yeah.

09:03:39.460 --> 09:03:40.460
I loved working there.

09:03:40.460 --> 09:03:42.460
Again, it was very taxing.

09:03:42.460 --> 09:03:47.460
I mostly left because a lot of my folks, a lot of the folks I worked with,

09:03:47.460 --> 09:03:51.460
the clients I supported, they were older.

09:03:51.460 --> 09:03:53.460
They were institutionalized when they were younger.

09:03:53.460 --> 09:04:00.460
So they were, if you have any idea what institutions were like in like the 70s and 60s and 50s,

09:04:00.460 --> 09:04:02.460
they were a mess.

09:04:02.460 --> 09:04:04.460
Dude.

09:04:04.460 --> 09:04:06.460
And it's kind of helping them through what they went through.

09:04:06.460 --> 09:04:08.460
It's pretty hard.

09:04:08.460 --> 09:04:13.460
And then another thing was they were older.

09:04:13.460 --> 09:04:14.460
So they're passing away.

09:04:14.460 --> 09:04:16.460
So it was really hard because I had grown up with a lot of them.

09:04:16.460 --> 09:04:18.460
My dad would take me to work with them.

09:04:18.460 --> 09:04:21.460
I would like sit in color while he helped them out just like,

09:04:21.460 --> 09:04:24.460
because it was an art therapy place as well.

09:04:24.460 --> 09:04:25.460
That was art therapy.

09:04:25.460 --> 09:04:28.460
That's also where I love to draw.

09:04:28.460 --> 09:04:30.460
My dad used to trick and joke with me.

09:04:30.460 --> 09:04:36.460
He's just like, oh, you thought you were, you thought you were helping them out.

09:04:36.460 --> 09:04:40.460
The clients, you were one of them.

09:04:40.460 --> 09:04:49.460
I was like, my dad was like gaslighting me to think I was disabled for the longest fucking time.

09:04:49.460 --> 09:04:51.460
I was fucking.

09:04:51.460 --> 09:04:53.460
My mom was so mad.

09:04:53.460 --> 09:05:00.460
She's like, why are you talking to that?

09:05:00.460 --> 09:05:13.460
Yeah, no, I was, it was, it was tough seeing the people that I had grown up knowing pass away.

09:05:13.460 --> 09:05:19.460
But it was really also nice to kind of give back and take care of them.

09:05:19.460 --> 09:05:23.460
He literally shot her island me.

09:05:23.460 --> 09:05:24.460
Streaming is my therapy.

09:05:24.460 --> 09:05:25.460
It really is.

09:05:25.460 --> 09:05:29.460
Again, I guess just get to talk.

09:05:29.460 --> 09:05:30.460
Streaming is very good.

09:05:30.460 --> 09:05:33.460
Again, my therapist was on vacation.

09:05:33.460 --> 09:05:38.460
So it was tough not being able to talk to her when Fia has been, not Fia.

09:05:38.460 --> 09:05:44.460
Reina has been, I'm so used to Fia being sick that Reina is sick now.

09:05:44.460 --> 09:05:53.460
I'm so used to talking to her about like what's going on with like my cats and stuff kind of sucks when she was around.

09:05:53.460 --> 09:05:55.460
But you know, everybody needs a fucking vacation.

09:05:55.460 --> 09:05:56.460
Are you kidding me?

09:05:56.460 --> 09:05:59.460
I heard people multiple yapp all the time about how much they hate their lives.

09:05:59.460 --> 09:06:03.460
Jesus Christ.

09:06:03.460 --> 09:06:05.460
And I know.

09:06:05.460 --> 09:06:14.460
And one of my friends, I recommended to her and we obviously there's like client confidentiality.

09:06:14.460 --> 09:06:19.460
She doesn't tell my therapist is telling my friend talks to her about, but I talked to my friend, obviously.

09:06:19.460 --> 09:06:25.460
And I'm like, damn, if I had to be her therapist, oh my God.

09:06:26.460 --> 09:06:28.460
That can be hard.

09:06:28.460 --> 09:06:32.460
My grandmother passed away from brain cancer the other year and you're really, but I'm so sorry about that.

09:06:32.460 --> 09:06:36.460
That's very hard.

09:06:36.460 --> 09:06:38.460
Loss is extremely difficult.

09:06:38.460 --> 09:06:40.460
Very extremely difficult.

09:06:40.460 --> 09:06:42.460
I'll be honest with you.

09:06:42.460 --> 09:06:45.460
I haven't experienced knock on wood.

09:06:45.460 --> 09:06:48.460
Watch my like grandfather die like three days or something.

09:06:48.460 --> 09:06:51.460
I haven't experienced a lot of like immediate family loss.

09:06:51.460 --> 09:06:57.460
Although my I'm actually my great grandmother passed away.

09:06:57.460 --> 09:06:59.460
Literally a couple of weeks ago.

09:06:59.460 --> 09:07:08.460
That was tough, but it was tough because I it was hard seeing my mom really worked up about it because she was super close to my great grandmother.

09:07:08.460 --> 09:07:10.460
But I haven't experienced a lot of loss.

09:07:10.460 --> 09:07:18.460
And so I always admire how people are strong people are people are so strong.

09:07:18.460 --> 09:07:20.460
So strong after those things.

09:07:20.460 --> 09:07:22.460
And sometimes they're not and that's okay.

09:07:22.460 --> 09:07:24.460
That's why there's other people there to lift them up.

09:07:24.460 --> 09:07:30.460
That's why it's important to have a support system so that you don't feel alone in the situations.

09:07:34.460 --> 09:07:36.460
Oh, baby.

09:07:38.460 --> 09:07:40.460
I don't know why I ran in here.

09:07:40.460 --> 09:07:52.460
Yeah, everybody I'm gonna I'm gonna recommend a book to you.

09:07:52.460 --> 09:07:54.460
This is my favorite book.

09:07:54.460 --> 09:07:56.460
One of my favorite books.

09:07:59.460 --> 09:08:01.460
Where is it? Where did I put it?

09:08:02.460 --> 09:08:10.460
I'm very nervous because I'm wondering if I gave it to someone to borrow and they never gave it back from work.

09:08:10.460 --> 09:08:13.460
And I will hunt that person the fuck down.

09:08:18.460 --> 09:08:20.460
My mom wrote something for me.

09:08:20.460 --> 09:08:22.460
It's very important to me.

09:08:31.460 --> 09:08:57.460
I'll read you what my mom said.

09:08:57.460 --> 09:08:59.460
So

09:09:07.460 --> 09:09:09.460
Now maybe I'll do like a

09:09:09.460 --> 09:09:14.460
I'll do a stream where I read this to you because I although I start I'll start fucking crying.

09:09:18.460 --> 09:09:24.460
But it's called and this is also like an Apple TV movie that they made into a movie.

09:09:24.460 --> 09:09:27.460
It's called the boy the mole the fox and the horse.

09:09:32.460 --> 09:09:34.460
What are you doing?

09:09:34.460 --> 09:09:36.460
And it's full of really sweet quotes.

09:09:36.460 --> 09:09:39.460
It's by Charlie Mackenzie or Mackenzie.

09:09:41.460 --> 09:09:43.460
Very beautifully illustrated.

09:09:43.460 --> 09:09:47.460
It's very unique like sketchy painted watercolor art style.

09:09:47.460 --> 09:09:50.460
You can just Google it and you can see some of the quotes in there.

09:09:51.460 --> 09:09:52.460
They're very reassuring.

09:09:52.460 --> 09:09:55.460
Anytime I'm feeling very, very down.

09:09:55.460 --> 09:09:56.460
I'm late.

09:09:56.460 --> 09:09:58.460
My voice is shaking because I love this book so much.

09:09:58.460 --> 09:10:02.460
And every time I open to a page, I want to cry.

09:10:02.460 --> 09:10:03.460
Oh yeah.

09:10:03.460 --> 09:10:04.460
My mom dated it.

09:10:04.460 --> 09:10:06.460
It was March 2021.

09:10:06.460 --> 09:10:07.460
I don't know.

09:10:07.460 --> 09:10:11.460
I think it was during COVID and I think I was just having a tough time with the isolation.

09:10:11.460 --> 09:10:19.460
I've literally bent so many corners in this book pages because there's so many good quotes.

09:10:19.460 --> 09:10:21.460
There's so many good quotes in here.

09:10:21.460 --> 09:10:23.460
But I highly recommend it.

09:10:23.460 --> 09:10:24.460
A member stream.

09:10:24.460 --> 09:10:25.460
Maybe.

09:10:25.460 --> 09:10:26.460
Maybe.

09:10:33.460 --> 09:10:34.460
I'm sorry.

09:10:34.460 --> 09:10:38.460
I just read about my mom row and I'm trying not to.

09:10:38.460 --> 09:10:41.460
I'm actually fine, but I'm trying not to get worked up.

09:10:41.460 --> 09:10:42.460
Okay.

09:10:42.460 --> 09:10:48.460
For redacted for she be the mole is very wise.

09:10:48.460 --> 09:10:54.460
I folded over corners of this book, which I hope you read from time to time when you're happy, when you're sad, when you feel alone.

09:10:54.460 --> 09:10:58.460
Remember, love always brings you home and I love you always, mom.

09:11:02.460 --> 09:11:04.460
So anytime I'm sad, I read that.

09:11:11.460 --> 09:11:13.460
I highly recommend the book.

09:11:13.460 --> 09:11:14.460
So sweet.

09:11:14.460 --> 09:11:15.460
My mom is very sweet.

09:11:18.460 --> 09:11:23.460
And maybe we'll watch it together for a watch along.

09:11:23.460 --> 09:11:24.460
That'd be cute.

09:11:24.460 --> 09:11:26.460
No, I'll just be crying the entire time.

09:11:26.460 --> 09:11:27.460
I can't do that.

09:11:27.460 --> 09:11:28.460
Like that.

09:11:28.460 --> 09:11:33.460
Literally that book and that movie give me a Pavlovian response where I literally cry.

09:11:33.460 --> 09:11:38.460
Like I'm tearing up right now and I'm okay, but I'm literally tearing up.

09:11:38.460 --> 09:11:43.460
I'm looking at my mup itself with the American flag next to me.

09:11:43.460 --> 09:11:44.460
I'm dead.

09:11:44.460 --> 09:11:45.460
I'm dead.

09:11:45.460 --> 09:11:46.460
I'm dead.

09:11:46.460 --> 09:11:47.460
I'm dead.

09:11:47.460 --> 09:11:48.460
I'm your dad too.

09:11:48.460 --> 09:11:49.460
Call me daddy.

09:11:49.460 --> 09:11:50.460
Who's your daddy?

09:11:50.460 --> 09:11:51.460
Who's your daddy?

09:11:51.460 --> 09:11:55.460
Actually, I need to think of what to do for a member stream next week.

09:11:59.460 --> 09:12:02.460
Okay, let me, I'm done with this for now because that's pissing me off.

09:12:02.460 --> 09:12:03.460
I'll do this.

09:12:03.460 --> 09:12:06.460
I'm probably going to play this tomorrow by myself.

09:12:11.460 --> 09:12:14.460
I will probably play a lot of this off stream.

09:12:14.460 --> 09:12:16.460
So you might, I might be redone off stream.

09:12:16.460 --> 09:12:20.460
I don't know because I'm not going to be able to wait and want to get to the DLC as soon

09:12:20.460 --> 09:12:23.460
as fucking possible.

09:12:23.460 --> 09:12:24.460
Crying the whole time would just be average.

09:12:24.460 --> 09:12:25.460
So I need to watch along.

09:12:25.460 --> 09:12:26.460
Porfin cries over there.

09:12:26.460 --> 09:12:27.460
Yeah.

09:12:27.460 --> 09:12:28.460
Wasn't she crying?

09:12:28.460 --> 09:12:29.460
I like, oh no.

09:12:29.460 --> 09:12:30.460
That's Sarah.

09:12:30.460 --> 09:12:35.460
That's Sarah was reading me when I was about to end.

09:12:35.460 --> 09:12:41.460
I can chat a little bit longer.

09:12:41.460 --> 09:12:42.460
Crying, watch along.

09:12:42.460 --> 09:12:49.460
Let me turn this fucking music down.

09:12:49.460 --> 09:12:51.460
Is that a Muppet?

09:12:51.460 --> 09:12:52.460
Yeah.

09:12:52.460 --> 09:12:55.460
You got a problem with this Muppet?

09:12:55.460 --> 09:12:58.460
You want to shmup it with this Muppet?

09:12:58.460 --> 09:12:59.460
Welcome Raiders.

09:12:59.460 --> 09:13:01.460
Chania Breakdown here at the end of John Wick 4.

09:13:01.460 --> 09:13:05.460
I don't know why she was crying at John Wick besides the first movie.

09:13:05.460 --> 09:13:06.460
I get it.

09:13:06.460 --> 09:13:07.460
I cried during the first movie.

09:13:07.460 --> 09:13:10.460
But why was she crying during the other movies?

09:13:10.460 --> 09:13:13.460
I can't remember what happened at the end of 4.

09:13:13.460 --> 09:13:15.460
4 wasn't Parabellum, was it?

09:13:15.460 --> 09:13:21.460
It was, that's, she cried so much.

09:13:21.460 --> 09:13:24.460
Chania's an emotional person.

09:13:24.460 --> 09:13:25.460
Welcome Raiders.

09:13:25.460 --> 09:13:26.460
Hello, Sarah.

09:13:26.460 --> 09:13:28.460
I want to shmup it with the Muppet.

09:13:28.460 --> 09:13:29.460
Of course you do.

09:13:29.460 --> 09:13:32.460
You can shmup it with this Muppet anytime.

09:13:32.460 --> 09:13:35.460
Anytime, Sarah.

09:13:35.460 --> 09:13:42.460
Mercy pulled a U today and came into the call and was being really funny.

09:13:42.460 --> 09:13:47.460
She scared the crap out of me with a little Atomaton.

09:13:47.460 --> 09:13:48.460
Atomaton?

09:13:48.460 --> 09:13:49.460
Atomaton?

09:13:49.460 --> 09:13:50.460
Atomaton?

09:13:50.460 --> 09:13:51.460
Pull up.

09:13:51.460 --> 09:13:52.460
YouTube studio.

09:13:52.460 --> 09:13:53.460
We're just going to gap.

09:13:53.460 --> 09:13:54.460
We're just gaping.

09:13:54.460 --> 09:13:55.460
We're just hanging out.

09:13:55.460 --> 09:13:56.460
Oh my God.

09:13:56.460 --> 09:13:57.460
The screen's so bright.

09:13:57.460 --> 09:13:58.460
Oh, I hate it.

09:13:58.460 --> 09:13:59.460
There we go.

09:13:59.460 --> 09:14:00.460
Now it's better.

09:14:00.460 --> 09:14:01.460
Sorry, I'm asleep.

09:14:01.460 --> 09:14:02.460
Sorry, I'm not asleep.

09:14:02.460 --> 09:14:03.460
Hello.

09:14:03.460 --> 09:14:04.460
Okay.

09:14:04.460 --> 09:14:08.460
It's so weird seeing my model after a while.

09:14:08.460 --> 09:14:09.460
Whoa.

09:14:09.460 --> 09:14:10.460
Excuse me.

09:14:10.460 --> 09:14:11.460
Your progress today?

09:14:11.460 --> 09:14:12.460
It's time to say goodnight.

09:14:12.460 --> 09:14:13.460
Good night.

09:14:13.460 --> 09:14:14.460
Good night.

09:14:14.460 --> 09:14:15.460
Good night.

09:14:15.460 --> 09:14:16.460
Good night.

09:14:16.460 --> 09:14:17.460
Good night.

09:14:17.460 --> 09:14:18.460
Good night.

09:14:18.460 --> 09:14:19.460
Good night.

09:14:19.460 --> 09:14:20.460
Good night.

09:14:20.460 --> 09:14:21.460
Good night.

09:14:21.460 --> 09:14:22.460
Good night.

09:14:22.460 --> 09:14:23.460
Excuse me.

09:14:23.460 --> 09:14:24.460
Your progress today?

09:14:24.460 --> 09:14:25.460
It's time to say goodnight.

09:14:25.460 --> 09:14:26.460
Thank you.

09:14:26.460 --> 09:14:27.460
Thank you for coming by.

09:14:27.460 --> 09:14:28.460
There she is.

09:14:28.460 --> 09:14:29.460
Oh, she be.

09:14:29.460 --> 09:14:30.460
Yeah.

09:14:30.460 --> 09:14:39.460
I can, um, I can, hold on.

09:14:39.460 --> 09:14:48.460
I can hold it up like I am controlling the Muppet.

09:14:48.460 --> 09:14:49.460
I'm up.

09:14:49.460 --> 09:14:54.460
It's actually controlling me if anything, just to, just to say.

09:14:54.460 --> 09:14:58.460
I'm trying to make this look as realistic as possible.

09:14:58.460 --> 09:15:00.460
Also cover my boobies.

09:15:00.460 --> 09:15:05.460
Now I look at the Muppet when you talk.

09:15:05.460 --> 09:15:06.460
All right.

09:15:06.460 --> 09:15:08.460
I'm taking them up on off.

09:15:08.460 --> 09:15:09.460
I forgot.

09:15:09.460 --> 09:15:12.460
I need to send PNGs to people that I'm collabing with.

09:15:12.460 --> 09:15:13.460
All right.

09:15:13.460 --> 09:15:15.460
I'm gonna take some pictures real quick.

09:15:15.460 --> 09:15:16.460
Don't, don't mind me.

09:15:16.460 --> 09:15:19.460
I'm just going to take some pictures.

09:15:19.460 --> 09:15:31.460
Which one is that one?

09:15:31.460 --> 09:15:33.460
Perfect.

09:15:33.460 --> 09:15:35.460
Taking selfies.

09:15:35.460 --> 09:15:38.460
What a terrible day to be a Muppet fan.

09:15:38.460 --> 09:15:40.460
Silly or menacing.

09:15:40.460 --> 09:15:41.460
Okay.

09:15:41.460 --> 09:15:45.460
I can be, I can be silly menacing.

09:15:45.460 --> 09:15:56.460
How do I, this looks terrifying.

09:15:56.460 --> 09:16:04.460
Do I look silly and menacing to you?

09:16:04.460 --> 09:16:06.460
I don't like that.

09:16:06.460 --> 09:16:11.460
Let me take this off.

09:16:11.460 --> 09:16:14.460
It's what, it was so funny.

09:16:14.460 --> 09:16:20.460
There, these were like, I think these were like bonus expressions that like the artists

09:16:20.460 --> 09:16:21.460
just like left.

09:16:21.460 --> 09:16:23.460
And then every group is going through.

09:16:23.460 --> 09:16:28.460
She's like, why does everybody have this face?

09:16:28.460 --> 09:16:32.460
That means all of us have this goofy face.

09:16:32.460 --> 09:16:34.460
What the fuck?

09:16:34.460 --> 09:16:36.460
I accidentally winked.

09:16:36.460 --> 09:16:39.460
I was like, what the fuck?

09:16:39.460 --> 09:16:42.460
I was like, what the fuck?

09:16:42.460 --> 09:16:45.460
I was like, what the fuck?

09:16:45.460 --> 09:16:48.460
I was like, what the fuck?

09:16:48.460 --> 09:16:58.460
I accidentally winked.

09:16:58.460 --> 09:17:01.460
That's better.

09:17:01.460 --> 09:17:15.460
Let me do a normal face.

09:17:15.460 --> 09:17:17.460
Oh, guys, it's so hard being a VTuber.

09:17:17.460 --> 09:17:30.460
I have to take selfies.

09:17:30.460 --> 09:17:34.460
Lippies aren't closing.

09:17:34.460 --> 09:17:39.460
Sometimes VTube Studio think my lips are like how my mouth is open.

09:17:39.460 --> 09:17:46.460
So like my mouth is closed right now, ready?

09:17:46.460 --> 09:17:53.460
And it thinks my mouth is open.

09:17:53.460 --> 09:17:58.460
She really said, oh.

09:17:58.460 --> 09:18:00.460
Can't wait for Tan to talk a little bit.

09:18:00.460 --> 09:18:01.460
I know, me too.

09:18:01.460 --> 09:18:03.460
I can't wait.

09:18:03.460 --> 09:18:09.460
I think I'll feel even more like myself than them, Tan.

09:18:09.460 --> 09:18:11.460
You're so beautiful.

09:18:11.460 --> 09:18:12.460
Thank you.

09:18:12.460 --> 09:18:13.460
Sheepie's lips.

09:18:13.460 --> 09:18:15.460
Which lips were I talking about?

09:18:15.460 --> 09:18:16.460
Were I talking?

09:18:16.460 --> 09:18:20.460
Fuck, never mind.

09:18:20.460 --> 09:18:25.460
I'm getting overtired again.

09:18:25.460 --> 09:18:29.460
I feel like I want to take one more picture.

09:18:29.460 --> 09:18:30.460
I want to selfie.

09:18:30.460 --> 09:18:43.460
I'll do one with my cute mouth.

09:18:43.460 --> 09:18:57.460
Maybe I should look the other way.

09:18:57.460 --> 09:18:58.460
Cool.

09:18:58.460 --> 09:19:04.460
It's always good to have a lot of PNGs on hand, you know?

09:19:04.460 --> 09:19:11.460
Always good.

09:19:11.460 --> 09:19:12.460
Maybe the ropes are back.

09:19:12.460 --> 09:19:13.460
You need to go back.

09:19:13.460 --> 09:19:14.460
I know I'm restraining myself.

09:19:14.460 --> 09:19:15.460
I'm calm.

09:19:15.460 --> 09:19:25.460
Let me throw in some music.

09:19:25.460 --> 09:19:28.460
I'm going to my bedroom.

09:19:28.460 --> 09:19:41.460
We're going to my bedroom.

09:19:41.460 --> 09:19:42.460
I know that's too fucking loud.

09:19:42.460 --> 09:19:44.460
I don't know why.

09:19:44.460 --> 09:19:45.460
Okay.

09:19:45.460 --> 09:19:46.460
Oh.

09:19:46.460 --> 09:19:48.460
I should just put a Muppet.

09:19:48.460 --> 09:19:51.460
I should just send people who are asking for a PNG.

09:19:51.460 --> 09:19:56.460
You just my Muppet self.

09:19:56.460 --> 09:19:59.460
That would be terrifying.

09:19:59.460 --> 09:20:08.460
I can't even see the one who they picked.

09:20:08.460 --> 09:20:18.460
There we go.

09:20:18.460 --> 09:20:40.460
That's a lot of multiple.

09:20:40.460 --> 09:20:56.460
I'm going to tell you so huge.

09:20:56.460 --> 09:21:05.460
I should have asked mommy to get me a thing where I can put my hands on my hips.

09:21:05.460 --> 09:21:10.460
I think that would be, and I can just power stance.

09:21:10.460 --> 09:21:11.460
Oh, hi, Tomo.

09:21:11.460 --> 09:21:12.460
Did you win?

09:21:12.460 --> 09:21:15.460
I was really about to look at your DMs.

09:21:15.460 --> 09:21:25.460
What is this?

09:21:25.460 --> 09:21:52.460
I'm secretly responding to Tomo.

09:21:52.460 --> 09:21:57.460
Tomo's cooking, by the way.

09:21:57.460 --> 09:21:59.460
You guys have no idea what she's cooking.

09:21:59.460 --> 09:22:01.460
She also sends me a TikTok that I can't watch right now.

09:22:01.460 --> 09:22:03.460
Wait, can I watch it right now?

09:22:03.460 --> 09:22:21.460
Can I watch this to cut?

09:22:21.460 --> 09:22:23.460
Oh, my God, me.

09:22:51.460 --> 09:22:58.460
Oh, my God, they're so African.

09:22:58.460 --> 09:22:59.460
I love it so much.

09:22:59.460 --> 09:23:18.460
They just remind me of my aunties.

09:23:18.460 --> 09:23:25.460
I don't know if you guys can hear that, but it was funny.

09:23:25.460 --> 09:23:28.460
It was very funny.

09:23:28.460 --> 09:23:31.460
Can't wait to see it's cursed.

09:23:31.460 --> 09:23:40.460
My free page is built brick by brick for my friends.

09:23:40.460 --> 09:23:46.460
All right, well, I guess I'll read mercy.

09:23:46.460 --> 09:23:52.460
Let me see.

09:23:52.460 --> 09:24:04.460
Oh, holy crap.

09:24:04.460 --> 09:24:09.460
Where?

09:24:09.460 --> 09:24:14.460
I can't find YouTube, please.

09:24:14.460 --> 09:24:15.460
Where am I?

09:24:15.460 --> 09:24:17.460
Oh, it's under this.

09:24:17.460 --> 09:24:22.460
Oh, bad.

09:24:22.460 --> 09:24:34.460
Oh, Aimee's opening memberships.

09:24:34.460 --> 09:24:39.460
Well, when I said I would already read mercy, but I want to read Aimee.

09:24:39.460 --> 09:24:40.460
Oh, no.

09:24:40.460 --> 09:24:44.460
I could not drum off so many friends streaming.

09:24:44.460 --> 09:24:49.460
What do I do?

09:24:49.460 --> 09:24:53.460
I love Aimee, but I love mercy too.

09:24:53.460 --> 09:25:05.460
I wish I could split a raid.

09:25:05.460 --> 09:25:09.460
Well, I told Mercy I would read her something.

09:25:09.460 --> 09:25:12.460
But go see Aimee as well.

09:25:12.460 --> 09:25:14.460
She's opening memberships.

09:25:14.460 --> 09:25:16.460
I love her.

09:25:16.460 --> 09:25:17.460
She's so sweet.

09:25:17.460 --> 09:25:26.460
We were talking today because we're going to do a collab soon with some other girlies.

09:25:26.460 --> 09:25:29.460
Question harder than the Dark Souls boss because I love so many people.

09:25:29.460 --> 09:25:32.460
There's like five people streaming right now that I wish I could rate all at the same time.

09:25:32.460 --> 09:25:36.460
Just split you all like 25, 20 people.

09:25:36.460 --> 09:25:37.460
You go there.

09:25:37.460 --> 09:25:38.460
You go there.

09:25:38.460 --> 09:25:39.460
All right.

09:25:39.460 --> 09:25:40.460
Tell mercy I say hi.

09:25:40.460 --> 09:25:45.460
Just say all you got to say is surprise and then you just say like a funny noise.

09:25:45.460 --> 09:25:48.460
Just be like, that's what she did to me.

09:25:48.460 --> 09:25:50.460
I want to bed though.

09:25:50.460 --> 09:25:53.460
I'm knocking out because I've been streaming since two.

09:25:53.460 --> 09:25:54.460
Holy crap.

09:25:54.460 --> 09:25:56.460
I started streaming nine hours ago.

09:25:56.460 --> 09:25:57.460
I just looked at my own thing.

09:25:57.460 --> 09:25:58.460
What the hell is wrong with me?

09:25:58.460 --> 09:26:00.460
I'm really a product.

09:26:00.460 --> 09:26:02.460
I'm really my mother's daughter.

09:26:02.460 --> 09:26:04.460
I can't even fucking talk.

09:26:04.460 --> 09:26:13.460
How do you type a bunny noise?

09:26:13.460 --> 09:26:14.460
I don't know.

09:26:14.460 --> 09:26:15.460
Go bunny noise.

09:26:15.460 --> 09:26:16.460
Bunny noise.

09:26:16.460 --> 09:26:19.460
You can just be like bunny noises and asterisks.

09:26:19.460 --> 09:26:21.460
I'm so tired.

09:26:21.460 --> 09:26:23.460
I don't even remember how to end stream.

09:26:23.460 --> 09:26:24.460
Okay.

09:26:24.460 --> 09:26:25.460
There we go.

09:26:25.460 --> 09:26:27.460
I'm like, how the fuck?

09:26:27.460 --> 09:26:29.460
I'm so like Elden Ringbrained right now.

09:26:29.460 --> 09:26:31.460
I'm just like, huh?

09:26:31.460 --> 09:26:33.460
What's happening?

09:26:33.460 --> 09:26:43.460
I was going to talk to Strani.

09:26:43.460 --> 09:26:45.460
I want to ask you that.

09:26:45.460 --> 09:26:46.460
Yes.

09:26:46.460 --> 09:26:48.460
I know I'm on my end extreme, but I'm going to talk to you on my next screen.

09:26:48.460 --> 09:27:01.460
Help me convince Strani to do a cover of, um, wait, what's the song called?

09:27:01.460 --> 09:27:16.460
The song from the Lord of the Rings that Ed Sheeran sings.

09:27:16.460 --> 09:27:17.460
I see fire.

09:27:17.460 --> 09:27:18.460
Yes.

09:27:18.460 --> 09:27:22.460
I want to do a cover of I see fire with Strani.

09:27:22.460 --> 09:27:23.460
Convince her to do it with me.

09:27:23.460 --> 09:27:27.460
I haven't asked her yet, but I will.

09:27:27.460 --> 09:27:30.460
Also, my goal XLR came in.

09:27:30.460 --> 09:27:31.460
Thank you.

09:27:31.460 --> 09:27:32.460
I'm going to put that together.

09:27:32.460 --> 09:27:33.460
Together.

09:27:33.460 --> 09:27:34.460
I can't talk at all.

09:27:34.460 --> 09:27:35.460
Oh my God.

09:27:35.460 --> 09:27:36.460
I'm so tired.

09:27:36.460 --> 09:27:38.460
Um, I'm going to put that together tomorrow.

09:27:38.460 --> 09:27:46.460
I'll see if I can do some funky shit because I was waiting for that so I can do, um, reverb

09:27:46.460 --> 09:27:50.460
a lot easily for, for karaoke.

09:27:50.460 --> 09:27:53.460
So maybe member stream will be karaoke.

09:27:53.460 --> 09:27:54.460
Hmm.

09:27:54.460 --> 09:27:55.460
Hmm.

09:27:55.460 --> 09:27:56.460
Hmm.

09:27:56.460 --> 09:27:57.460
Hmm.

09:27:57.460 --> 09:27:58.460
Hmm.

09:27:58.460 --> 09:28:02.460
Why are you claimed if I do that though?

09:28:02.460 --> 09:28:03.460
Or should I do an archive?

09:28:03.460 --> 09:28:05.460
How do I, I don't even know how that works.

09:28:05.460 --> 09:28:07.460
I don't know how YouTube works.

09:28:07.460 --> 09:28:13.460
Um, but anyways, uh, stay beautiful, stay gorgeous, stay you, stay amazing.

09:28:13.460 --> 09:28:15.460
I hope you enjoyed our chat tonight.

09:28:15.460 --> 09:28:16.460
I know I enjoyed it.

09:28:16.460 --> 09:28:19.460
Um, again, if you didn't agree with something that I said, you're totally entitled to that.

09:28:19.460 --> 09:28:21.460
And, you know, you can disagree.

09:28:21.460 --> 09:28:23.460
I still love you.

09:28:23.460 --> 09:28:25.460
No, I don't.

09:28:25.460 --> 09:28:26.460
I didn't say that.

09:28:26.460 --> 09:28:27.460
You smell.

09:28:27.460 --> 09:28:28.460
You stink so bad.

09:28:28.460 --> 09:28:29.460
God damn.

09:28:29.460 --> 09:28:30.460
Take a shower, bro.

09:28:30.460 --> 09:28:31.460
Jesus Christ.

09:28:31.460 --> 09:28:33.460
My harem smells.

09:28:33.460 --> 09:28:35.460
Anyways, I'll see.

09:28:35.460 --> 09:28:37.460
What am I doing tomorrow?

09:28:37.460 --> 09:28:39.460
Am I streaming tomorrow?

09:28:39.460 --> 09:28:41.460
How am I doing?

09:28:41.460 --> 09:28:45.460
Am I doing Hades or ASMR?

09:28:45.460 --> 09:28:48.460
I still didn't fix my fucking 3DU.

09:28:49.460 --> 09:28:50.460
Whoopsies.

09:28:50.460 --> 09:28:52.460
Anyways, I'll leave you with that.

09:28:57.460 --> 09:28:59.460
I hope you have a good time.

09:29:02.460 --> 09:29:03.460
I hope you have a good time.

09:29:03.460 --> 09:29:04.460
What?

09:29:04.460 --> 09:29:06.460
I don't even know what I'm talking about.

09:29:09.460 --> 09:29:12.460
Just, let me just turn off my microphone and stop, stop talking.

09:29:12.460 --> 09:29:13.460
I'm tired.

09:29:13.460 --> 09:29:14.460
Oh my God.

09:29:14.460 --> 09:29:16.460
Good night.

09:29:16.460 --> 09:29:20.460
Don't let the sheebie bite.

09:29:22.460 --> 09:29:23.460
Heehee.

09:29:46.460 --> 09:30:07.460
Oh yeah, happy 4th, bye.
