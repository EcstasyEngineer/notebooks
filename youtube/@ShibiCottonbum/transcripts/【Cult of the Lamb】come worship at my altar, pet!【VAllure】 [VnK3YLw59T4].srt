00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:51,220
I have set up crowd control for Cult of the Lamb, I've just kept all of the regular like coin amounts so like you can, I'm doing air quotes, purchase coins to mess with me on stream and I'm just like, I left everything there like I didn't take away like me switching weapons taking away my health vice versa.

51
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:59,220
So you guys can go ham if you want to you know help great or if you want to fuck me over great it's fine.

52
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:07,220
I have played Cult of the Lamb before I almost beat it I haven't finished it all the way through so we're starting a new save.

53
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:15,220
So you're letting us kill you whenever you get maybe I might have to adjust it but we'll see.

54
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:20,220
I don't know my chat died. Oh there it is there it goes.

55
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:30,220
But we'll see how because I've never used crowd control I've only played Cult of the Lamb with Twitch and they have like a built-in extension like companion on the lamb and I was pretty straightforward.

56
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:41,220
Although it was pretty easy to set up crowd control and I got the pro version so because Cult of the Lamb is like early access to get the pro version to get it.

57
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:52,220
And but I also know some other cool games on there that I would love to play with crowd control like inscription is one of my favorite games of all time and I would love to do.

58
00:07:52,220 --> 00:08:02,220
I'm like really tempted to like yoink one of my stuff things from next for next week and do inscription with crowd control.

59
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:10,220
I don't know if I could never use it before yeah and either way so I think it'll be lots of fun.

60
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:16,220
I'm very epi so I've pounded two energy drinks.

61
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:20,220
We'll see how hyper I get.

62
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:25,220
Wow delicious Red Bull.

63
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:31,220
Did you see you call the lamb trailers today as local co-op yeah I'm like I tagged strongy in the trailer and I was like.

64
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:37,220
And then I just deleted it because it's a local and I'm like well fuck me then.

65
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:40,220
She's so far away.

66
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:43,220
I just get I only like the regular Red Bull.

67
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:50,220
I like could have gotten a Celsius but then Celsius is like shit to me and I haven't drink a monster in a very long time.

68
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:57,220
I remember I had like four monsters in the span of like an hour and I had like really bad heart palpitations.

69
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,220
That was funny.

70
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:04,220
That was real fun those days being a mall rat going through the mall.

71
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,220
Steam has played together.

72
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,220
Lots of people play local co-op games remotely.

73
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,220
What?

74
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:12,220
You're lying to me.

75
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,220
Is that true?

76
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,220
Have you tried Nukko?

77
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,220
That sounds like a drug so no.

78
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,220
Pink monsters.

79
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,220
I just only I don't like the original flavors of everything.

80
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,220
I don't like like although I do like the monster green team.

81
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:28,220
So time for an off club.

82
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,220
They rolled out during the primitive.

83
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,220
Oh okay.

84
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,220
Is there a way to send you money for super chat?

85
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,220
You can support me.

86
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:41,220
I have text to speech donations on with stream elements.

87
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,220
So you guys can mess around with that.

88
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:49,220
We all I think we all have partner now like we can all apply.

89
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:54,220
So but then it takes about like almost a month to get approved for monetization.

90
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,220
So super chats.

91
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:01,220
I don't know if YouTube will just fucking nuke our channels and be like who's applying horse.

92
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,220
No.

93
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,220
So we'll have to see can you have a hot dog.

94
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,220

103
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,220
I haven't played call the layman like three months.

104
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:42,220

105
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,220

109
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,220
We love the yappings.

110
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,220
I'm you know I appreciate it.

111
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:15,220
I remember back when I was a high priestess sometimes I would yeah for like an hour before I even started a game and they'd be like can you please just play or switch to just chatting.

112
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,220
I come into your stream and he won't shut up.

113
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,220
I'm looking for a game.

114
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,220
I'm like get the fuck out then.

115
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,220
I'm here to talk.

116
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,220
All right.

117
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:27,220
Daycare simulator.

118
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:31,220
But some bad news.

119
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,220
I mentioned it on my alt briefly.

120
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:40,220
My landlord discovered I'm harboring a fugitive known as Fia.

121
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:44,220
I'm supposed to have only two cats in my apartment.

122
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:48,220
And so they're like you the maintenance guys I think rat it on me.

123
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:54,220
So fuck those maintenance guys because you have to pay pet rent for every pet and it's like 50 bucks for a cat.

124
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:59,220
And I'm like I already pay like $1500 in rent.

125
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,220
You're telling me I have to pay rent for my cats.

126
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:11,220
Like if it was like I get it for like dogs and stuff because if they have amenities with a dog like a dog bath or like a dog park and whatever but like I'm like dude.

127
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:19,220
And so I'm just like I'm so I'm like already looking for a new place and I was texting my parents and my dad's is like honestly just save.

128
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:24,220
And I'm like what do you mean and my dad just like to start spamming save in our family's group chat.

129
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,220
My mom's like can you shut up and it was really funny.

130
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:34,220
But my dad's like come on with the with the hentai waifu money you'll be making.

131
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:42,220
You can save for a house and and I'm like not if they kick me out dad where am I going to stream.

132
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:52,220
But yeah no I'm going to save I'm going to look at other places but like I'm just lying to them and saying I'm cat sitting so we'll see.

133
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:55,220
Isn't it better to buy an apartment at this point.

134
00:12:55,220 --> 00:13:00,220
But you can't really well you could like a condo or something.

135
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:05,220
Yeah no it's way more worth it where I am in to buy instead of rent.

136
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:13,220
I could move to another state where it would make more sense to rent but again like I've lived in this apartment for almost two years now.

137
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:26,220
And I was really just going to like wait it out until I do you get enough money to save and move and like purchase my own house but like I might have to be sooner rather than later.

138
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:31,220
But I'm actually I'm not that worried because you know I'm just really thankful.

139
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:42,220
Sometimes stuff just like I fear the worst and stuff works out for me whether it be like random acts of kindness from you guys or strangers or like.

140
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:47,220
I don't know I just I just have faith that I'll be fine so I'm not I'm not really I'm not going to stress about it.

141
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:52,220
I'm just going to hang out with you guys and you know do my thing streaming public transport.

142
00:13:52,220 --> 00:14:00,220
I see streams from a laptop I could just get a laptop and just like streaming the wilderness something of a gamer myself.

143
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:04,220
Wait that was there.

144
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:09,220
I didn't put my headphones on yet so I didn't hear the Texas speech.

145
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:13,220
Hope this helps a bit thank you thank you I appreciate you so much.

146
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:21,220
Yeah but like honestly like don't feel like just because I told you that don't be like I have to save her that's not what I'm saying I'm just being honest with you.

147
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:27,220
So like if there's a time or like a week I don't stream it's because I'm probably moving but I'll keep you guys updated if that happens.

148
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:30,220
But I'm not I'm honestly not worried at all.

149
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:33,220
Force brothel let's go.

150
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:38,220
Call you Mr Sir Mommy go for it you can do either or sugar tits.

151
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:50,220
Yeah because I remember like sometimes I just like to talk to say hey what's going on in my life and I know and girls can say this to we don't tell you stuff to make you feel bad for us we just tell you because we like to talk to you.

152
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:53,220
We like to be honest with that's going on.

153
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:59,220
Because like I know as there was getting really emotionally yesterday because she's talking about her stuff.

154
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:04,220
That when I tell you I love a certain death she's a fucking cheaper for what she's gone through.

155
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:12,220
But I know she wasn't telling you to be like feel bad for me she's telling you because I'm like because like hey I have those shoes so some days are harder than others.

156
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:19,220
And like I have the same thing so I just appreciate you guys for being very understanding and supportive.

157
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,220
Yeah she's such a tuber.

158
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:27,220
But yeah because like we're all here we're content creators to have fun.

159
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:33,220
Yeah communication is a point especially in our relationship because you're my boyfriend go from.

160
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:44,220
I just thought of like I just thought of what's it called Ryan Gosling from the Barbie movie because your boyfriend go from.

161
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:52,220
Should be GFB let's go wait no don't get it twisted you're still the bottom of this relationship.

162
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,220
I'm just a lonely cow woman so I'm just gonna call you my boyfriend go from.

163
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:07,220
I'm sorry so many relationships and because of communication issues I probably yeah I would say so like.

164
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:16,220
When people don't it's usually from like my love my friends are married or dating people and I just love listening to their problems on bothered because I can't relate.

165
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:31,220
And so they'll just be like oh like money this money that or this thing and then he expects me to do this and I'm like did you tell him and then they'd be like well no when I'll be like.

166
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:39,220
Why you fucking are the or I know I'm usually I'm 100% nicer than that.

167
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:50,220
A lot of my coworkers like come to me with a lot of their problems because I'm motherly I'm big sisterly like even my coworkers who are older than me will be call me like their big sis just because like.

168
00:16:50,220 --> 00:17:00,220
I've grown so much from other people's experiences because people just tell me everything I think it's my Gemini moon or whatever.

169
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:06,220
And you know I got that I got that cancer rising in that Libra son baby girl.

170
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:13,220
But oh no she's one of those astrology bitches yeah I'm fucking am it's fun.

171
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:29,220
So people saw this like I know I'll shed some wisdom and like I remember and I was also a trainer for my job for a bit so a lot of I refer to a lot of my my trainees that have blossomed and grown and have already been there for a year at my job.

172
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:35,220
Like when they get like a raise or a promotion like that's my son that's my daughter I'm so proud of them.

173
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:42,220
One of them likes to call me the they like to say I was your first born.

174
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:48,220
So I guess yeah I'm some of my coworkers I've trained or my children that makes me a meal.

175
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:51,220
She's a 10 but she's a two astrology.

176
00:17:51,220 --> 00:18:00,220
But yeah no I'll I'll I used to have especially for guys because guys don't have usually a safe space to talk about their feelings.

177
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:15,220
And so I remember I had this like group of like two girls and one guy and one of the guys was like super down and I'm like hey what's going on here we're going to talk about we're going to have a therapy moment and then we all just like had a heart to heart.

I'm just an empathetic motherfucker you know sometimes sometimes they.

180
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:43,220
Sometimes people just need a vent and yeah I'm like I'm one of those people that like I care so much that's why it's a little bit hard for me to be a dom sometimes because I'm someone who's actually very.

181
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:47,220
Caring so my aftercare goes hard.

207
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,220
Not that I should answer my coworkers by the way.

208
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,220
No no no you never shit where you eat.

209
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:12,220

214
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,220
I'm sorry to sound like the one.

215
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:37,220
He did something like ex-libber.

216
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,220
People like he's black right.

217
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,220
Yeah yeah please don't follow him.

218
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:53,220

225
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,220
I know he's white.

226
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:30,220
Some people just grow up in a sort of like a with a you know just multiple groups of people so they just adapt the vernacular.

227
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:46,220
Mine only comes out when because normally I'm like very like I get made fun of all the time for like because I have a customer service voice where I just sound like hi oh my gosh welcome to redacted I'm so glad to help you today so what are you looking for.

228
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,220

229
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,220

230
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:55,220
My white friends are like what are you doing.

231
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,220

Where is the AVE coming from because then because honestly from TV.

233
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:15,220
Because there's not I think the demographic in my area is mostly like Spanish and white now that I really think of it.

234
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:25,220
Sorry I'm like thinking and I was like almost going to say something and just like docks my location and I'm like no that's not right.

235
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:31,220
I remember my old job my coworkers are prank each other by pretending to be customers and have a voice.

236
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,220
Oh it'd be so funny.

237
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,220
I like sometimes I.

238
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:44,220
I'd like go up to my manager and be like excuse me and to be like what and I'll be like hi I'd like to file a complaint.

239
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,220
And just like major Karen voice.

240
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:53,220
And yeah it's adopted the pot media culture 100% love and hip hop I don't.

241
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,220
I actually.

242
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:06,220
And it's I don't want to say no I'm not going to I'm not going to say nothing because I'm going to I don't want to take this ball down because people are going to take my shit out of context.

243
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,220
How do I safely dispose of scorpions.

244
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,220
Well there is a way to remove their stinger.

245
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:25,220
You could capture them in a bucket and then so you capture them in a bucket and you put a piece of paper or the cover down you try to guide them onto the cover and then you close it and then you can let them outside.

246
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:33,220
I don't scorpions unless they're like invasive you know they might be valuable to the environment so I don't recommend killing them.

247
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,220
I like are really like.

248
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,220

OK.

250
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,220
To tie in with what you're about to play and you call the lamb trailer.

251
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,220
Yeah we were talking about that.

252
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:50,220
I'm excited for the new stuff that's probably going to come out in like I don't know like a month or two.

253
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,220

00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:19,220
I'm gonna ride like I can or more we got the horses in the back.

261
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,220
We're tacky as a dad.

262
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:25,220
Don't know the lyrics so I'm gonna sing them bad.

263
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:27,220
Energy drink ruin the burp.

264
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,220
Oh that was pretty good.

265
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,220
I'm getting a lot of nines.

266
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,220
Fuck you forgive me a five.

267
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,220

Deep voice she be.

269
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:42,220
I remember I posted a tech talk of my range and someone's like so you're a man and I'm like.

00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:48,220
Thanks that's like the highest form of compliment for me for me.

271
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:51,220
I think I'm a dude with my voice range I guess.

272
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,220
Oh my gosh.

273
00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:00,220
It would make a lot of the stuff that I posted on my alt Twitter very confusing.

274
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,220
Deep voice she be coming at you from the bottom.

275
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,220
We got the horses in the burp.

276
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:14,220
My apartment is very good.

277
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:18,220
My apartment is very echoey as well.

278
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,220
I need to put those sound panels up.

279
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,220
Shout out to the person that got me some panels.

280
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,220
Alt Twitter is the best shit post so far.

281
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:30,220
I didn't expect my my alt Twitter to get like what is it like 17k now almost.

282
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:40,220
And like I just posted dumb as shit on there and I'm like why is it keep getting and so that's why I'm like I'm like scared to post as often as I would because normally I don't shut up on my alt.

283
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:44,220
But now there's like majority of bots eyes on me.

284
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,220
It's terrifying.

285
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,220
That's great.

286
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,220
She be is not a boy.

287
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,220
She be is not a dude.

288
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,220

I heard.

300
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:19,220
I got a little laugh yesterday in my Maros because apparently my little sister brapped on stream.

301
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:26,220
I had someone in my Maros like hey and this gave me a laugh.

302
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,220
I was like cracking up.

303
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:36,220
They're like hey I'm sorry we had such good times but I'm going to have to leave you for Emmy because she she farted on stream and you gave us burps.

304
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:39,220
But like you haven't farted for us yet.

305
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,220
That voice is like exactly how I read it.

306
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:49,220
It's like hey so I'm going to have to leave you for your little sister and I'm like this is not an airport.

307
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:52,220
You do not need to announce your departure but have fun.

308
00:27:54,220 --> 00:28:03,220
I will eventually probably fart too on accident when I can't mute fast enough but it's not you.

309
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,220
It's me.

310
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:10,220
I just I just really miss Mel Nakamada and she's like the closest thing I can get to her.

311
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,220
Okay.

312
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,220
Hell don't worry about it.

313
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,220
Don't worry about it.

314
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:29,220
I think there's like a compilation of back when I was a priestess all my my burps in my farts too so no one's going to find them.

315
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,220
I don't even know if it actually existed.

316
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,220
Mel mentioned.

317
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,220
That's such a good impression.

318
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,220
Damn you weren't lying with your range.

319
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:46,220
Like I said I wanted you to stream or maybe I'll do it in the collab that we have probably I think next week.

320
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:53,220
I'll be like hey guys so I need you all to say a line and I'm going to try to say it exactly the way that you say it.

321
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,220
Don't worry I'll make a burp compilation.

322
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,220
Hell yeah.

323
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:03,220
Is she be the new Mel iteration.

324
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,220
Hell no baby.

325
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,220
That would be funny though.

326
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:17,220
No trust me I'm not going to scam you guys and say I have cancer and then leave.

327
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,220
I'm sorry.

328
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,220

00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:29,220
Oh my god what is she saying stop it she be stop bad she be bad slap your ass she be sleep.

330
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:32,220
Damn what the fuck hold on.

331
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:36,220
Damn get a palm full of that.

332
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,220
Please don't awaken anything.

333
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:43,220
I'm an English guy so here you match my voice.

334
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:49,220
I can't like when I so what was it.

335
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:57,220
So when I played Andy and Lele I did like a very I gave Ashley a very like.

336
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:07,220
Okay and like okay Andy like that sort of voice and then Andy was like fuck what the hell man like damn this like that kind of like tomboy voice but for every other character.

337
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:18,220
I just gave a real shitty like British accent and then like same thing when I played Liza P just like really bad British accents all around.

338
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,220
Yo she be got the dumpy.

339
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:27,220
She be does not have a dumpy she has a okay thumbs up E.

340
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:34,220
Damn the shock wave Liza P Liza piss I like to call it.

341
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:40,220
It's time to put this what time is it oh it's almost time oh hi boomi.

342
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:48,220
Sometimes boomi likes to reach over to me and like reach out when he stretches on his cat bed next to me and just like touch me lightly in the arm.

343
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:51,220
I'm just like hello sir yes I know you're still there.

344
00:30:55,220 --> 00:31:03,220
More boobin than dumpy yes more boobin than dumpy although hey do you guys want to fund like my brush reduction because my back started hurt.

345
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:11,220
What was that song my back is aching my brow too tight something something something something I think that's like a Beyonce song.

346
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:23,220
Is this crowd control thing going to dox me no I turned off names and and photos so I shouldn't do anything for you.

347
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:35,220
Sounds like an insult to God yeah but when you're skinny as a rail in your body type your boobs don't match the rest of your body type.

348
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:51,220
Your back hurts a lot you know how hard it is to find clothes I have I'm scared to try on the cosplay I got for she be because I know it's not going to fit over my boobs so I might have to come up with another strategy to.

349
00:31:52,220 --> 00:32:08,220
To like find like just another version of the outfit because I'm scared I'm scared of being so often I go to dressing rooms try stuff on and I just cry because everything else fits perfect minus my boobs cut a hole out for the boobs.

350
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:14,220
What oh that reminds me I need to get like a bra that's similar.

351
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:27,220
Wait because I don't have to well hmm I was good thing I was planning on buttoning up my shirt but should I unbutton it for the cost.

352
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:37,220
Oh thank God I'm not a woman and then like I have friends and I bet strong he has this problem because she has a fat ass where they're like.

353
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:45,220
You know a little bit smaller like medium is premium on top and then when they go to pull up their pants their ashes and fit in any.

354
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:55,220
Pants because like their thighs and their ass are thick ums the rest of them is normal ums.

355
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:12,220
Not the nerf I got the rope for the cosplay yeah I got the rope for the cosplay well I got like a there's like a lingerie thing that I can just put on because I am not going through the effort of tying she barry although again like I said I want to do a membership stream while we learn to tie she barry.

356
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:20,220
Cake topping out the bakery suffering from success.

357
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:27,220
500 sound right for a corset or under bus is actually tailored for you um.

358
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:35,220
I sound a little bit expense maybe because like I have corsets.

359
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:42,220
Not comfortable it's like the thing is like the lingerie for the rope is pre tied.

360
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:53,220
I have two corsets one one I use for cosplay that I think I just chucked because I use it for a fairy cosplay when I went somewhere to a Renaissance fair.

361
00:33:54,220 --> 00:34:05,220
And then another one I just had because I when I was working from home I just kept slouching so I put on a corset and it helped me set up straight and it was actually helpful spray on she barry.

362
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:16,220
I'm sure I heard a girl crying for not having back pain oh yeah it's always like the girls with small boobs always wish they had some the girls with big boobs always wish they had small ones and like I just want to be like in the middle.

363
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:25,220
I remember because I've been to physical therapy for the pain because I have like a fucked up neck and shoulder because of it and have to get like injections in my neck and shit.

364
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:42,220
I mean shop steroids all right right um but I remember my physical therapist um he was just like hey no he's not touching my boobs by the way get the fucking out of your head now he just directed me what to do with how to move my shoulder properly okay.

365
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:58,220
All right relax um he was telling me his wife got a reduction and then like he was just like yeah it was a fucking shame I'm like I was looking at him like of course of course you her husband would say that it was really fucking funny.

366
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:23,220
Um everyone's always unhappy yeah exactly everybody has like a little I'm doing like that salt bait like a little dash of dysphoria dash of fuck my life I hate my body and especially as a woman be like with like eastern and western ideals of like beauty and stuff it's like what the fuck do I do with my body when I don't look like that.

367
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:52,220
But yeah I'm like I think like the only thing I'm very insecure about is because I am partially melanated if I like hurt myself like if I bruise really easily and it can you can really see it on my skin and if I get like um a scratch like if I fucking boomy ran across my foot and I have a scratch on my foot and it looks like I like slashed myself because it just like leaves are really like.

368
00:35:54,220 --> 00:36:06,220
Dark scar although the rest of me is super light and so like I have lots of like I remember I was wearing short sleeves at work and a girl was just like oh my god the fuck happened to you and I'm like.

369
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:18,220
Then the other girl was like you can't just fucking say that because I just have like um I have scars all over my body so I promise you it's not it's not self harm scars it's just like I'll get a zit.

370
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:27,220
I leave it or if I pick at it it just leaves a scar so I have like lots of um my mom lovingly calls me her little leopard sometimes.

371
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:42,220
Emojibi no it's not deep gashes it's really like the most superficial stuff like if I like accidentally like I'm trying to think of something.

372
00:36:43,220 --> 00:37:02,220
If I got like stung by a bee the you know how like when you get stung by a bee it turns red um mine just turns dark brown like I don't even need to touch it and I just scar I just scar so fucking easily and so it just fucking sucks that's like the only thing I'm self conscious about.

373
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:16,220
Oh my god Carrie cause ask people why they have scars and then I'll usually make the joke that like you want to know how I got these scars being brown like she be yeah she be I get it now.

374
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:27,220
Jesus Christ those are damage I think I'll be honest I don't really take it personally because sometimes people just like don't have social cues and just ask those things.

375
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:33,220
Or like you know tism you know it's a little dash of tism.

376
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:44,220
Let me see I saw someone ask that question you put cream on them yeah I put stuff on them you say leopard or a leopard no a leopard like the spots.

377
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:54,220
And you know my mom always is really cute and she's just like you know scars like show us that we've survived things and we've lived Pat I'm like mom shut the fuck up I just like give me some laser.

378
00:37:54,220 --> 00:38:01,220
Can you like be rich or something so I can get like laser treatment so I can get these scars and like this show up about me doing anything.

379
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,220
Cause like they don't have body foundation.

380
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:09,220
I was gonna speak and make up a super dark lie.

381
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:23,220
Oh yeah no cause I have like at first when she first asked me that I was like oh I just shoot myself and she was like what I'm like no fucking I just have these scars relax.

382
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:27,220
And then the other guy that's when the other girl was like you just fucking ask people why they're like that.

383
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:34,220
Or be a little bit like and they were called like she was from another country too like so she was just like being genuinely curious.

384
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:37,220
So I know she wasn't like being malicious about it.

385
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:42,220
Survive my cat walking over me yeah I live bitch.

386
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:46,220
I also have scars cause my freaking cat used me as a scratch toy I know.

387
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:52,220
Boomi will sometimes like stretch on on me like he'll reach up with his little paw paws.

388
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:57,220
But he only does this if I'm wearing pants cause he knows my pants isn't my skin so then he'll use his claws.

389
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:03,220
But if I'm not wearing pants and he reaches up to get pet he won't he'll be he'll I call it soft paw and I'm like thanks for the soft paw.

390
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:08,220
Have you ever used the line do you want to know how oh yeah all the time all the time.

391
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:15,220
You know I got the scar I got the scar oh I had like what was it.

392
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:19,220
There was like one scar I got.

393
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:24,220
It was I think it was from one of my older cats I used to have a cat named Naomi.

394
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:33,220
And she I think I was holding her and she just like what I like held her wrong or something and because she like needed to jump out of my arm so she pushed off.

395
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:43,220
She left like a crazy scratch and it looked like it looks kind of cool like it looks like I got I fought someone and I did tell a girl in grade school that I was stabbed.

396
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:55,220
She believed it and I still like and right next because and then she just and then this fucking girl proceeded to stab me with a stick fuck you Mackenzie I still have the scar fuck you I hate you so much.

397
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:08,220
I was like 10 and I told her yeah I was stabbed she's like oh really stabbed you with a stick yeah remember that same year that winter I got hit with an ice ball in the ear.

398
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:14,220
And then the kid who threw it passed out from looking seeing my blood and I was just laughing maniacally.

399
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,220
Mackenzie hate.

400
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:23,220
With the stick oh wait can I fart hold on.

Oh my God.

403
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:09,220
I hope I hope we get like we need every girl to fart so we can have like a fart compilation like a clip of just every viewer member fart.

404
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,220
Eat more fiber though.

405
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:24,220
I see I thought I was going to be the first one but then since Emmy was the first one I'm not shy anymore because if my little sister can do it then I can do it.

406
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:28,220
So now I'm just as cool as her.

407
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:39,220
I'm uncomfortable I'm starting to stare from that statement but that's all deal that's the only one you'll get that's the only one you'll get the rest patreon.

408
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:47,220
I ain't ripping ass for free except for that one so clip that you can play that as much as you want.

409
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:58,220
You know so bad it's gonna be so weird no I don't think like I know I don't think I see for a zero would maybe a zero I see maybe a little cute princessy farts.

410
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:01,220
I don't know what like why are you guys like farts.

411
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:09,220
It's just like for me like toilet humors is really funny so like when a streamer does it like I just cackle a lot but then somewhere you are just like.

412
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:14,220

00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:25,220
We bond through farts is that how it works that's what girls do in the bathroom I'm going to tell you a little secret.

415
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:31,220
We just go in the bathroom we just share our farts with each other.

416
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,220
It's exactly what it's like.

417
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:38,220
Ha ha pee pee poo poo yep exactly and we did on the ASMR stream.

419
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:50,220
I'm sweating it's hot it's hot in my fucking apartment for some reason though I have the AC cranked up.

420
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:53,220
Don't know why that is.

421
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:56,220
Oh.

422
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,220

🌊

429
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:09,620
Why would I destroy it?

430
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,200
Why would I destroy Pluto?

431
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,700
It's already been through enough

432
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:17,500
No. Dont ruin my Girlbath infanticies

433
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:34,500
Yeah, I'm not a woman or a man. I am just an eldritch being from another dimension. That's why you don't know anything about my early history and my lore. It's because they couldn't show it because it would make you go crazy.

434
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,500
Yeah.

435
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:39,500
Why the fuck did I call the lamgo?

436
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:53,500
I'm crazy. I was crazy once. I'm one of the old ones.

437
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,500
I wouldn't mind a fudashibi.

438
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,500
Bro, where did you come from with that?

439
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:04,500
I said eldritch being like, you know I wouldn't mind fuda.

440
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,500
That's not what that means!

441
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:13,500
Crazy? I was crazy once. It locked me in a room.

442
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:16,500
Okay, you know what I'm gonna do?

443
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:37,500
I will release the audio of me applying to an agency where all I did for five minutes in the video was being a straightjacket and scream and cry.

444
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,500
Then I did that for three or five minutes.

445
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:43,500
I will show that after stream.

446
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:45,500
I was not the first one to say that.

447
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:46,500
Oh, were you?

448
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:47,500
Okay.

449
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:51,500
Where's my...

450
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:52,500
Okay, how's game sound?

451
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,500
How's game sound, baby grills?

452
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:56,500
How are we doing?

453
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:57,500
You applied to phase?

454
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,500
No.

455
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:06,500
No, so this was before the viewer opened stuff.

456
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:11,500
Because again, I didn't think I was gonna get into the viewer because I didn't think I was cool enough, but look at me now.

457
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,500
Yeah, your little fucking whore.

458
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:22,500
Not mentally ill enough.

459
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,500
Oh, honey, you don't even know.

460
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:27,500
He doesn't know.

461
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,500
He doesn't know how mentally ill I am.

462
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:31,500
Why do you think I deal with these voices?

463
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,500
Because the voice is in my head.

464
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:42,500
You're just hiding your cheaper.

465
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:47,500
Game sound okay?

466
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:48,500
Perfect.

467
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:49,500
Cool, cool, cool.

468
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:56,500
Hidden yonder?

469
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:58,500
Yeah.

470
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,500
Aren't we all just like a little land area at heart?

471
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:05,500
Mentally ill, but not PC mentally ill?

472
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:07,500
I need to stand up.

473
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:08,500
My ass is sweating.

474
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:09,500
What the fuck is going on?

475
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:12,500
It's so hot.

476
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:14,500
I'm only wearing a T-shirt.

477
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,500
I need to air my ass out.

478
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:18,500
Hold on.

479
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:21,500
Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup.

480
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:23,500
Smack that thing.

481
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:25,500
Corporal love.

482
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:30,500
Oh, but as I was saying, so, um, so I applied for the socks V2 being agency.

483
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:35,500
This is before like I'm great for them.

484
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,500
I'm happy to get in.

485
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:41,500
I was just applying like Vila like was my one and only.

486
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:46,500
If I if I got into any other, I would have fucking dropped it for Vila.

487
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:48,500
I'll tell you that right now.

488
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:52,500
So don't think you guys are like, oh, she only applied cuz she had no other.

489
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:53,500
No, that's not the case.

490
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,500
But because they're like, oh, we bought some really crazy bitches.

491
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:00,500
And I'm like, hey, you know, I'm a crazy bitch.

492
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:02,500
I can be crazy.

493
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:08,500
And so I sent like a very me-me application where I talked about Avril Lavigne having a doppelganger.

494
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:14,500
And like I said, and she was replaced socks, socks agency by a, what's their name?

495
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:15,500
What's their name?

496
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:20,500
Flork the the the the the the artist.

497
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,500
There we go.

498
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:25,500
Gotta hide by wait.

499
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,500
Well, I'm not really hiding my titties, but it's fine.

500
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:29,500
I want all in.

501
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:31,500
I'm surprised the voices are real.

502
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:32,500
I'm not schizophrenic guys.

503
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:33,500
I'm not schizophrenic.

504
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:34,500
I swear.

505
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,500
Let's get to Fernia does run in my family.

506
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:37,500
I don't have schizophrenia.

507
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:41,500
Maybe shut up anyways.

508
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:45,500
Yeah.

509
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:49,500
Come on.

510
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:55,500
That one Chad.

511
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:57,500
E.T.L.

512
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:59,500
Blessed soul.

513
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:03,500
Her name is literally on the website as an investor.

514
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:16,500
Hey, at me.

515
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:21,500
Can I run?

516
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,500
Oh wait, you know what I should do?

517
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,500
One hell yeah devolver.

518
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:33,500
I'm gonna make my way.

519
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:41,500
I like it when

520
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,500
I reflect the screen.

521
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:51,500
I think it's fun.

522
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:53,500
Like how strong he does it.

523
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:54,500
Whoa.

524
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:57,500
I'm a little I'm a little too dark.

525
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:00,500
Hold on just a moment.

526
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,500
White woman jump scare.

527
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:05,500
There we go.

528
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:06,500
There we go.

529
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:14,500
Laura.

530
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:26,500
I thought that was my voice.

531
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:28,500
Wait.

532
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:30,500
But for us.

533
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,500
That's the last of its kind.

534
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,500
Others have hunted down and put to the blade.

535
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:42,500
With its final sacrifice,

536
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:44,500
the prophecy will be impossible to fulfill.

537
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,500
The heretic who lies down down below

538
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,500
will be condemned to attorney to captivity.

539
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:55,500
The old faith shall be preserved.

540
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,500
This isn't my first time being a cult leader.

541
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:05,500
I've been a cult leader before.

542
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,500
Where the fuck I am.

543
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,500
If you know that reference, I love you.

544
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:29,500
Come closer.

545
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:30,500
Fear not.

546
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:32,500
For though you are already dead,

547
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:34,500
I still have need of you.

548
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:38,500
Those foolish bishops thought they could keep me from me and death,

549
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:41,500
but instead they sent you straight to me.

550
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:45,500
I will give you life again for debt or price.

551
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:50,500
All I ask is for you to start to call to my name.

552
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,500
Do we have a deal?

553
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:57,500
White woman jump scare.

554
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:00,500
I didn't even notice that my stuff went like that.

555
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:02,500
My choice.

556
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:05,500
Take the red crown from

557
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,500
which I once wore.

558
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,500
With it you shall command the lower two followers

559
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:12,500
and strike fear to the hearts of our enemies.

560
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:14,500
Return to your land of the living.

561
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:17,500
Start to call to my name and begin recruiting followers.

562
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,500
She be the angel.

563
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:26,500
All eat my ass.

564
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:28,500
Once you've done so you'll see me again.

565
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:29,500
Now go.

566
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:41,500
Lord inaccurate she be.

567
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:47,500
Let me know if it's too loud.

568
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,500
I love the music.

569
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,500
They're like wow she's actually not dead yet.

570
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:18,500
Yeah I'm decent.

571
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,500
Oh wait my BGM is playing.

572
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,500
I don't even fucking know this.

573
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,500
What about that? Does that sound better?

574
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,500
It's just dance for a moment.

575
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:38,500
Start voguing.

576
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:42,500
Shake that.

577
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:43,500
Shake that.

578
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:47,500
Throw it back on this dig.

579
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,500
Yeah get it.

580
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,500
Throw it back on the strap.

581
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:54,500
Okay we're good.

582
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:55,500
Cool.

583
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:01,500
Can you throw it back?

584
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,500
Yeah I can throw it back.

585
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:05,500
I shake what my mama kinda gave me.

586
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:06,500
Relax.

587
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:11,500
I'm matching those things right now.

588
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:12,500
Thanks you're welcome.

589
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:13,500
Welcome.

590
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:19,500
Okay let's see if stuff works.

591
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:22,500
Cause I know you can claim to be the follower.

592
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:31,500
I was trying to think if I could do Jamaican accent.

593
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,500
But I don't think I can.

594
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:38,500
Fear not I am run out.

595
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:41,500
That's not a Jamaican accent cause I'm trying to think of a voice to give him.

596
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,500
I might just give everybody uwu voices.

597
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:46,500
Gamer girl wuga.

598
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:49,500
Hello man would you kindly share a number on the account?

599
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:51,500
I have to fart.

600
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:55,500
It's not for free.

601
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,500
That was the only one for free.

602
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,500
Is the land like dancing or vibing?

603
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,500
I think they're just vibing.

604
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,500
You guys are fucking...

605
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:11,500
Little brap stuff.

606
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,500
Fear not.

607
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,500
I was sent to guide you.

608
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:23,500
We are the deep in the lands of the old faith and in great danger.

609
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:26,500
She's just gonna have a really bad London accent or whatever the fuck.

610
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:27,500
Australian.

611
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:29,500
My instructions are I'll lead you to safety.

612
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,500
Continue through the woods.

613
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:32,500
Escape loads ahead.

614
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:33,500
I'm Sean Connery.

615
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,500
I will be close by.

616
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:44,500
I'll let it go.

617
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:55,500
Ooh I get one coin.

618
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:58,500
What to open inventory?

619
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:02,500
That's not good.

620
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:05,500
Huh?

621
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:07,500
Oh.

622
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:11,500
I'm like my controller doesn't look like that.

623
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:19,500
I don't even think I ever really looked at my inventory when I played before either.

624
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:24,500
What's my best operation of a Jamaican?

625
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,500
Probably offensive.

626
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:32,500
Although I was listening to a lot of dancehall yesterday.

627
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:37,500
Six million ways to die. Choose one.

628
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,500
Ah ah ah ah ah.

629
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:46,500
Listen to a little chocolate demersen plier.

630
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:51,500
Oh my god.

631
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:53,500
I have to fart again.

632
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:59,500
It's because I had Indian food.

633
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,500
Almost penniless.

634
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:08,500
Oh my god.

635
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:09,500
Gibi's farting so much.

636
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,500
Why is she announcing it?

637
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:15,500
Because you're gonna wonder why I mute and pause for a second and stare at me like I'm stupid.

638
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,500
Like is she okay?

639
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:20,500
Is she having an absence seizure?

640
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:21,500
Probably.

641
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:23,500
How's your spice tolerance?

642
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:24,500
Non-existent.

643
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:36,500
Come here.

644
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:38,500
Come here you little bitch.

645
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:46,500
Maybe some kind of mental illness is happening.

646
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:47,500
It's already happened.

647
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:51,500
A.O. shout out to Christina Applegate.

648
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:55,500
Brother.

649
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:57,500
I know what you're referencing.

650
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:58,500
It's fucked.

651
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:00,500
Non-existent.

652
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:03,500
Butter chicken.

653
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,500
No, it's not spicy.

654
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:07,500
I didn't get spicy.

655
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:09,500
I just got goat korma.

656
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:12,500
Yeah, I like goat and lame a lot.

657
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:20,500
We have nearly reached safety, but look ahead on their pulse.

658
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:21,500
So let's be sacrificed.

659
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:23,500
It's one of you bitches.

660
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,500
Oh mighty bishops of the old faith.

661
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:29,500
We asked, I don't know why I sound like Toad.

662
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:32,500
We asked you to accept the sacrifice of this wretched soul.

663
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:34,500
Hey, who interrupts her ritual?

664
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:35,500
Trespass is on signal.

665
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:38,500
Mario.

666
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:40,500
Oh.

667
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,500
I don't think I can die though.

668
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:45,500
Because I don't have any hearts.

669
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:47,500
Yeah, I think I'm fine.

670
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:57,500
My favorite in this game is the axe.

671
00:58:58,500 --> 00:58:59,500
Pfft.

672
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:16,500
Oh, my Toad is nowhere.

673
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:18,500
That's pretty good Toad voice. Thank you!

674
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:20,500
Hold on, I want to see for the crowd control.

675
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:22,500
I think I turned off something.

676
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:24,500
I just want to make sure that it's fine.

677
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:26,500
Pfft.

678
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:28,500
Test effect.

679
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:37,500
Is it working?

680
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:40,500
No, whatever.

681
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:47,500
Did it work? I can't tell.

682
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:53,500
Hold shift to delay five seconds.

683
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:55,500
Pfft.

684
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,500
Oh, it's so tiny.

685
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:05,500
I can't see it up there.

686
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:06,500
Hold on.

687
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:09,500
Keep talking amongst yourselves.

688
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:16,500
I can ban people.

689
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:17,500
That's funny.

690
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:18,500
Okay.

691
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:19,500
Can I figure?

692
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:20,500
Pfft.

693
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:24,500
Settings.

694
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:29,500
Options.

695
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:34,500
Inside the sound.

696
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:37,500
This is very interesting overview.

697
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:43,500
Oh, if you guys will use real money, I can get paid.

698
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:45,500
What the fuck? I didn't even know it was a thing.

699
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:51,500
Oh, aren't you funny.

700
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:56,500
Thank you for the tip.

701
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:05,500
Wait.

702
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:09,500
Damn, I can't use crowd control.

703
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:10,500
It only takes credit cards.

704
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,500
Damn you credit cards.

705
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:12,500
Damn you.

706
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:16,500
I don't know why the sound effect didn't work.

707
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:24,500
I swear stream elements has like a love-hate relationship with me.

708
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:29,500
Sometimes they'll just be like, yeah, we'll work properly.

709
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:32,500
Yeah, that's fine.

710
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:42,500
Oh, there's a no though.

711
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:47,500
No, I don't think you have to use really, you should be able to get free coins and stuff.

712
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:52,500
Because I know some of you have already claimed stuff from when I'm looking at the history of stuff.

713
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:57,500
It should be good.

714
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:59,500
It should be good in the hood.

715
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:01,500
I don't know how to use it.

716
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:18,500
Oh, I hate you no less.

717
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:20,500
Yeah, it's fine.

718
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:22,500
It's all like normal.

719
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,500
Texas Beach.

720
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:26,500
I might have to have management look at that.

721
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:28,500
Make sure it's fine.

they don't really like they don't really feel

757
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:39,000
ambiguous to me by hand our cult will grow powerful but it only makes sense to have a cult of just pure men

01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:50,920

when i'm talking about milk when it's in another form

1158
01:55:57,720 --> 01:56:02,360
you can eat milk depends on how expired it is i actually drank expired milk the other day

1159

1219
02:02:19,080 --> 02:02:27,720
you guys are gonna say i'm fucked for this but i um i uh so i was like i said i

1220
02:02:27,720 --> 02:02:32,520
was watching yellow jackets and yellow jackets is a great survival show about like these girls

1221
02:02:32,520 --> 02:02:36,440
that have to survive in the wilderness after the plane crashes and a bunch of other shit too it's

1222
02:02:36,440 --> 02:02:41,320
like it's really cool psychological horror a little bit of like spiritual horror stuff and so at

1223
02:02:41,320 --> 02:02:46,680
one point they catch a rabbit and they make it and i'm like man i wonder what rabbit tastes like

1224
02:02:49,240 --> 02:02:56,520
so uh they had rabbit at my store and it happened to be on sale so i bought a whole young

1225
02:02:56,520 --> 02:03:01,480
rabbit and i processed it i broke it down and i made it into stew and it was one of the most

1226
02:03:01,480 --> 02:03:05,080
delicious stews i've ever made does that make me a cannibal

1227
02:03:10,040 --> 02:03:12,520
oh yellow jackets are wash well when you're hungry

1228
02:03:13,480 --> 02:03:17,960
as a frenchman rabbit is good yeah i was like it's it's almost like dark meat of a turkey

1229
02:03:19,560 --> 02:03:24,600
um yeah i have like pictures of me uh breaking down the rabbit that i took

1230
02:03:25,240 --> 02:03:30,200
old pictures of the rabbit that i broke down brutal why are you eating yourself

1231
02:03:31,560 --> 02:03:35,480
it was worth it your fourth third cuz i want to remove

1232
02:03:36,440 --> 02:03:40,920
i was yeah i was feeling really Hannibal lector you know do you know how difficult it is to break

1233
02:03:40,920 --> 02:03:44,920
down an animal because my this is a whole rabbit i had a little bit like the awfuls in there too

1234
02:03:44,920 --> 02:03:50,360
there was some heart the kidneys were good um so that's it's probably the most

1235
02:03:51,720 --> 02:03:54,280
so i think yeah the weirdest thing i've ever eaten was a rabbit's heart

1236
02:03:57,560 --> 02:04:03,080
why are you taking pictures because i'm fucked up have you tried gator tastes like chicken

1237
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:09,960
um but like yeah i had to because i couldn't just like i wasn't gonna just throw it in the oven

1238
02:04:09,960 --> 02:04:13,800
like i wanted to specifically make a stew out of it because in the show they made a stew out of it

1239
02:04:14,520 --> 02:04:20,680
and guys i like to make a lot of fucked up stuff from media that i play so like i've made like i made

1240
02:04:20,680 --> 02:04:26,680
a rabbit stew from yellow jackets but then i also made like the same stew from coffin of andy and lele

1241
02:04:26,680 --> 02:04:37,240

like feral and animalistic sometimes where i just wanted like

1244
02:04:55,080 --> 02:05:00,600
i'm gonna sound like a fucking serial killer if i said never mind um i did not eat human

1245
02:05:00,600 --> 02:05:05,800
i didn't eat long pork i know uh who was it that talked about long pork is it loomi

1377
02:20:31,320 --> 02:20:37,320

1378
02:20:37,320 --> 02:20:44,440
a lot or whatever so many eyes on me and having to get permissions and stuff would just be like i would

1379
02:20:44,440 --> 02:20:49,080
literally have a panic attack every time i went live i'm kind of happy that like we're small

1380
02:20:49,400 --> 02:20:54,600
but it's funny because i honestly expected us to not get a large viewership but i wasn't doing

1381
02:20:54,600 --> 02:20:59,240
for viewership i was doing because i wanted to have fun um and be like with the group of girls

1382
02:20:59,240 --> 02:21:06,440
and have friends and be in the company together and just collab and um but yeah i didn't expect

1383
02:21:06,440 --> 02:21:15,480
as much success as we have gotten and then go do your thing we can wait i'm gonna piss on the

1386
02:21:29,720 --> 02:21:35,000
the fuck the song is some people are definitely blind by the numbers and can't work an actual

1387
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:41,320
company like yeah like i've worked in corporations like like for a good chunk of my career so like

1388
02:21:41,320 --> 02:21:47,960
i know how to be like if i was in haul life or if i was in like nijisanji god for fucking bid

1390
02:21:56,440 --> 02:22:07,240
my personality back a little bit and not be like as lewd or as like untoward and forward um negligible

1391
02:22:07,240 --> 02:22:14,360
but um i'm really happy that with veeler i can kind of really be myself but then like you know

1392
02:22:14,360 --> 02:22:18,440
then there's like marine like she's kind of like who and like there's like a there's a couple of

1395
02:22:32,360 --> 02:22:38,520
because like yeah when you join niji you get like an auto like boost of viewership and all that stuff

1396
02:22:38,520 --> 02:22:45,560
but then you know there's some other stuff that goes along with it um she's seen you already um

1397
02:22:46,680 --> 02:22:54,520
but yeah it's like it is what it is i'm not gonna talk about that or otherwise we'll go in a rant

1398
02:22:54,520 --> 02:23:01,080
i know strawney has the same feelings as i do negative feelings he used to get the boost but

1399
02:23:01,080 --> 02:23:09,240
anymore i know i think not to like number or anything or talk about that or anything but like

1400
02:23:09,240 --> 02:23:14,040
so i know i'm performing a little bit better than the new niji sawni livers really surprises me it makes

I want to kermit.

Kermit the frog.

1458
02:34:43,900 --> 02:34:44,900
I don't know what you said.

1459
02:34:44,900 --> 02:34:45,900
Jokes on you.

1460
02:34:45,900 --> 02:34:47,900
I like to be jam.

1461
02:34:47,900 --> 02:34:52,900
I literally checked, but what I realized I muted was I muted something else.

1462
02:34:52,900 --> 02:34:54,900
I muted...

1463
02:34:54,900 --> 02:34:59,900
I think I accidentally muted my 3D audio instead, although it's not running.

1464
02:34:59,900 --> 02:35:03,900
So...

1465
02:35:03,900 --> 02:35:11,900
Imagination fills the blanks, cool.

1466
02:35:11,900 --> 02:35:17,900
Oh, and I just want to say, if you're a Neegee fan, please don't come for me.

1467
02:35:17,900 --> 02:35:19,900
Please.

1468
02:35:19,900 --> 02:35:22,900
I like your livers. Please don't hurt me.

1469
02:35:22,900 --> 02:35:23,900
I promise.

1470
02:35:23,900 --> 02:35:25,900
I won't say anything.

1471
02:35:25,900 --> 02:35:27,900
Please don't hurt me.

1472
02:35:27,900 --> 02:35:40,900
I really like their little cute and funny girl they got.

1473
02:35:40,900 --> 02:35:42,900
Her design is really adorable.

1474
02:35:42,900 --> 02:35:43,900
Twisty.

1475
02:35:43,900 --> 02:35:48,900
And I'm a Victoria Blight Brite Shield fan.

1476
02:35:48,900 --> 02:35:53,900
Alright, what about playing the game, right?

1477
02:35:54,900 --> 02:35:57,900
Free my Neegee ocean.

1478
02:35:57,900 --> 02:36:00,900
I see a box to create a little box even stream.

1479
02:36:00,900 --> 02:36:02,900
Well, yeah, there's not enough...

1480
02:36:02,900 --> 02:36:05,900
Oh, you guys are starving, I forgot.

1481
02:36:05,900 --> 02:36:06,900
There's too many of you.

1482
02:36:06,900 --> 02:36:11,900
I have to kill some of you off.

1483
02:36:11,900 --> 02:36:12,900
I like Skarl.

1484
02:36:12,900 --> 02:36:13,900
Skarl is cool.

1485
02:36:13,900 --> 02:36:18,900
Choco.

1486
02:36:18,900 --> 02:36:20,900
Beast?

1487
02:36:20,900 --> 02:36:22,900
Let's see.

1488
02:36:22,900 --> 02:36:25,900
Let's scratch my nose.

1489
02:36:25,900 --> 02:36:29,900
I think there's a game, you know?

1490
02:36:29,900 --> 02:36:33,900
Probably gonna play this for like five hours or something.

1491
02:36:33,900 --> 02:36:36,900
I'm supposed to switch to the mapping.

1492
02:36:36,900 --> 02:36:40,900
I don't know why I choked.

1493
02:36:40,900 --> 02:36:41,900
Where's the other dude?

1494
02:36:41,900 --> 02:36:42,900
Oh, he's over here.

1495
02:36:42,900 --> 02:36:48,900
He's fighting for his life.

1496
02:36:49,900 --> 02:36:51,900
Alright, let's go.

1497
02:37:01,900 --> 02:37:04,900
Where the fuck did these bitches come from?

1498
02:37:04,900 --> 02:37:09,900
When you were a kid, did you ever sit in a place

1499
02:37:09,900 --> 02:37:12,900
and pretend like ninjas were gonna drop down from the ceiling

1500
02:37:12,900 --> 02:37:14,900
and you were the only one that could save all the people in the building

1501
02:37:14,900 --> 02:37:15,900
so you would fight them off?

1502
02:37:15,900 --> 02:37:17,900
I would do that at church a lot when I was bored.

1503
02:37:17,900 --> 02:37:22,900
I'm like, what if just a bunch of motherfuckers just busted up in my church

1504
02:37:22,900 --> 02:37:30,900
and there were ninjas, and then I used some little bitch-no-jutsu on them.

1505
02:37:30,900 --> 02:37:34,900
God, so I don't care if you're starving.

1506
02:37:34,900 --> 02:37:35,900
Cool.

1507
02:37:35,900 --> 02:37:36,900
Okay, I'm not the only one.

1508
02:37:36,900 --> 02:37:37,900
Cool.

1509
02:37:37,900 --> 02:37:38,900
Cause you just get so bored.

1510
02:37:38,900 --> 02:37:41,900
Like if you had to like go to church or like do something with your mom

1511
02:37:41,900 --> 02:37:43,900
or like go shopping or whatever.

1512
02:37:43,900 --> 02:37:46,900
Just be like this picture of weird stuff.

1513
02:37:46,900 --> 02:37:49,900
I forgot that I'm supposed to be picking stuff.

1514
02:37:49,900 --> 02:37:50,900
I meant to pick the spyglass.

1515
02:37:50,900 --> 02:37:52,900
I'm just pressing A.

1516
02:37:52,900 --> 02:37:53,900
It's fine.

1517
02:37:53,900 --> 02:37:54,900
I don't care that much.

1518
02:37:57,900 --> 02:38:00,900
I just want the fleece that lets me do automatically three anyways.

1519
02:38:07,900 --> 02:38:08,900
Oh.

1520
02:38:10,900 --> 02:38:12,900
Oh, yeah, fervor.

1521
02:38:13,900 --> 02:38:16,900
Get fucking, god.

1522
02:38:17,900 --> 02:38:18,900
Cool.

1523
02:38:18,900 --> 02:38:19,900
Can I?

1524
02:38:19,900 --> 02:38:20,900
Oh, I have to shoot.

1525
02:38:26,900 --> 02:38:28,900
I love to see it.

1526
02:38:28,900 --> 02:38:29,900
Oh, that hurt my throat though.

1527
02:38:31,900 --> 02:38:33,900
How am I supposed to be the throat goat like this?

1528
02:38:33,900 --> 02:38:34,900
Just kidding.

1529
02:38:34,900 --> 02:38:35,900
That's a serious job.

1530
02:38:37,900 --> 02:38:39,900
I'm god, it's like I think from Hades.

1531
02:38:40,900 --> 02:38:42,900
Yeah, I want to play Hades so bad.

1532
02:38:43,900 --> 02:38:45,900
I think I can only go this way again.

1533
02:38:50,900 --> 02:38:51,900
Can I burp?

1534
02:38:51,900 --> 02:38:52,900
Again, I don't notice when that happens.

1535
02:38:54,900 --> 02:38:56,900
I'm glad you could catch a stream too on your lunch break.

1536
02:38:58,900 --> 02:39:00,900
I too like to watch streamers on my lunch break.

1537
02:39:04,900 --> 02:39:08,900
So then I can just stick my headphones in and pretend to ignore everybody.

1538
02:39:10,900 --> 02:39:11,900
Oh.

1539
02:39:22,900 --> 02:39:24,900
All right, I already have plenty of followers so I don't need that.

1540
02:39:25,900 --> 02:39:32,900
I could get some food for cooking and I forget what that little thing means.

1541
02:39:34,900 --> 02:39:37,900
I can't remember, but I'd rather go this anyways.

1542
02:39:39,900 --> 02:39:40,900
A little short burp.

1543
02:39:41,900 --> 02:39:42,900
Yeah, I tend to cute.

1544
02:39:42,900 --> 02:39:43,900
Cool.

1545
02:39:43,900 --> 02:39:44,900
Fuck your family.

1546
02:39:44,900 --> 02:39:45,900
Die, die.

1547
02:39:46,900 --> 02:39:50,900
Death, death of honey, death of punky, die, death.

1548
02:39:50,900 --> 02:39:55,900
Oh wait, I don't know why I'm killing them when I don't have bones yet.

1549
02:39:57,900 --> 02:40:00,900
Look what you've done, you've massacred my boy.

1550
02:40:00,900 --> 02:40:03,900
I can't even make any fish recipes yet, I don't think.

1551
02:40:04,900 --> 02:40:06,900
I'm gonna get the fucking...

1552
02:40:07,900 --> 02:40:09,900
Oh, I should have gotten the seeds actually.

1553
02:40:11,900 --> 02:40:14,900
I can't hit his wife, his wife is so precious.

1554
02:40:18,900 --> 02:40:19,900
What? Oh, I have to...

1555
02:40:19,900 --> 02:40:20,900
I'm like, what?

1556
02:40:21,900 --> 02:40:22,900
Shit's in good...

1557
02:40:22,900 --> 02:40:23,900
Yeah, you know, sometimes it'd be like that.

1558
02:40:23,900 --> 02:40:26,900
Sometimes you just gotta murder people, you gotta murder people, shit's in giggles.

1559
02:40:27,900 --> 02:40:29,900
I just realized my mouth hasn't been moving this entire time.

1560
02:40:30,900 --> 02:40:31,900
I didn't know what he'd tell me.

1561
02:40:31,900 --> 02:40:36,900
I didn't know what he'd tell me, I was just staring at you awkwardly.

1562
02:40:37,900 --> 02:40:38,900
Why am I so small?

1563
02:40:47,900 --> 02:40:49,900
Because you were watching the K&L.

1564
02:40:50,900 --> 02:40:51,900
Because I stood here in telepathic.

1565
02:41:01,900 --> 02:41:03,900
I don't know if you're too close, that's good.

1566
02:41:16,900 --> 02:41:17,900
I don't know if you're...

1567
02:41:17,900 --> 02:41:19,900
I don't know if you're aware of this.

1568
02:41:20,900 --> 02:41:21,900
Here I am.

1569
02:41:23,900 --> 02:41:25,900
I don't know if I'm always in my head.

1570
02:41:25,900 --> 02:41:26,900
Yeah, you're in your head.

1571
02:41:27,900 --> 02:41:30,900
I don't know if I'm in my head, I don't know if you're aware of this.

1572
02:41:32,900 --> 02:41:33,900
They don't exist.

1573
02:41:34,900 --> 02:41:35,900
So I'm solving a dream.

1574
02:41:36,900 --> 02:41:38,900
Game is loud, your mom's loud.

1575
02:41:49,900 --> 02:41:52,900
Washing the game and not your pretty mouth, oo-woo.

1576
02:41:57,900 --> 02:41:58,900
My oo-woo-woo mouth.

1577
02:41:58,900 --> 02:42:02,900
I'll take the top because I'm a top.

1578
02:42:29,900 --> 02:42:30,900
Sorry.

1579
02:42:30,900 --> 02:42:33,900
Tour a land of many gods once, hundreds now.

1580
02:42:40,900 --> 02:42:41,900
On the very first.

1581
02:42:44,900 --> 02:42:49,900
You know how you gargle like mouthwash?

1582
02:42:49,900 --> 02:42:51,900
Like you go, ah, like that's what I do.

1583
02:42:54,900 --> 02:42:57,900
That's how I can also do like a cat pernoise.

1584
02:42:57,900 --> 02:42:58,900
Like.

1585
02:43:02,900 --> 02:43:05,900
Although my throat is a little bit dry, so I can't like do it as nice.

1586
02:43:09,900 --> 02:43:10,900
Can I just take the rest of these?

1587
02:43:11,900 --> 02:43:12,900
Oh, I can.

1588
02:43:13,900 --> 02:43:14,900
Get fucked.

1589
02:43:15,900 --> 02:43:16,900
I'm stealing.

1590
02:43:19,900 --> 02:43:20,900
I'm stealing.

1591
02:43:21,900 --> 02:43:22,900
I've been stealing along.

1592
02:43:28,900 --> 02:43:29,900
Oh, I hate these ones.

1593
02:43:30,900 --> 02:43:31,900
Hate them so much.

1594
02:43:33,900 --> 02:43:37,900
My least favorite enemy in this game, any variation of them, I just fucking hate.

1595
02:43:49,900 --> 02:43:51,900
So you foolishly persist, little lamb.

1596
02:43:52,900 --> 02:43:55,900
I hear your lies and I smell your fear.

1597
02:43:56,900 --> 02:44:01,900
The red crown rises again, but what an unworthy bearer it has.

1598
02:44:05,900 --> 02:44:07,900
Eat my fucking- oh, what the hell?

1599
02:44:07,900 --> 02:44:08,900
I thought-

1600
02:44:10,900 --> 02:44:11,900
Get fucked.

1601
02:44:12,900 --> 02:44:13,900
Get fucked.

1602
02:44:15,900 --> 02:44:16,900
Get fucked.

1603
02:44:19,900 --> 02:44:20,900
Ho-ya!

1604
02:44:20,900 --> 02:44:21,900
Oh, ow.

1605
02:44:22,900 --> 02:44:23,900
Come here, you little bitch.

1606
02:44:26,900 --> 02:44:29,900
Oh, I hate that they jump because then I can't tell with the depth of the field.

1607
02:44:38,900 --> 02:44:39,900
Things their voice can do.

1608
02:44:39,900 --> 02:44:41,900
I wish I knew how to purr.

1609
02:44:42,900 --> 02:44:43,900
I know.

1610
02:44:43,900 --> 02:44:47,900
I remember it was like really weird because I was able to do that since I was a little kid.

1611
02:44:47,900 --> 02:44:51,900
So people would be- I was like, oh yeah, I can purr and kids would be like, what? No way.

1612
02:44:51,900 --> 02:44:52,900
They purr in my ears.

1613
02:44:52,900 --> 02:44:55,900
I just purred people's ears like a fucking weirdo.

1614
02:44:55,900 --> 02:44:57,900
And that's why I like to war your cats.

1615
02:44:57,900 --> 02:44:59,900
I was a cat girl all along.

1616
02:45:00,900 --> 02:45:01,900
Oh, you guys just gave me a blunderbuss.

1617
02:45:01,900 --> 02:45:02,900
What the fuck?

1618
02:45:09,900 --> 02:45:10,900
Oh, shit.

1619
02:45:11,900 --> 02:45:12,900
Oh, I'm gonna be back in the corner.

1620
02:45:14,900 --> 02:45:15,900
It's hard to aim sometimes.

1621
02:45:22,900 --> 02:45:23,900
Cool beans.

1622
02:45:23,900 --> 02:45:25,900
Okay, I'm gonna go back for that one over there.

1623
02:45:27,900 --> 02:45:29,900
Yeah, ASMR before is ASMR.

1624
02:45:32,900 --> 02:45:33,900
Okay.

1625
02:45:45,900 --> 02:45:47,900
I like the blunderbuss, so I'll keep it.

1626
02:45:47,900 --> 02:45:48,900
It's a bit-

1627
02:45:49,900 --> 02:45:51,900
I can also just get-

1628
02:45:59,900 --> 02:46:00,900
Yeah, that should be fine.

1629
02:46:02,900 --> 02:46:04,900
I don't care if you're starving.

1630
02:46:09,900 --> 02:46:10,900
I read war your cats too.

1631
02:46:10,900 --> 02:46:11,900
Of course I read war your cats.

1632
02:46:11,900 --> 02:46:12,900
That was my shit.

1633
02:46:12,900 --> 02:46:14,900
I was larping the fuck out of war your cats.

1634
02:46:18,900 --> 02:46:19,900
What's up?

1635
02:46:19,900 --> 02:46:20,900
It's-

1636
02:46:22,900 --> 02:46:24,900
It's your deputy, Broke and I here.

1637
02:46:25,900 --> 02:46:26,900
What's up?

1638
02:46:26,900 --> 02:46:28,900
It's your medicine cat, Nightrun here.

1639
02:46:28,900 --> 02:46:29,900
That was my names.

1640
02:46:29,900 --> 02:46:30,900
I was a-

1641
02:46:30,900 --> 02:46:31,900
Some of my sub-OCs.

1642
02:46:31,900 --> 02:46:33,900
Actually, I think I have like still have a list and like-

1643
02:46:35,900 --> 02:46:39,900
I emailed a lot of my like OC character sheets to myself.

1644
02:46:39,900 --> 02:46:41,900
So I have to find that in my old email.

1645
02:46:42,900 --> 02:46:43,900
What cat clan were you?

1646
02:46:43,900 --> 02:46:44,900
I was Shadow Clan.

1647
02:46:44,900 --> 02:46:47,900
Hello Shadow Clan.

1648
02:46:47,900 --> 02:46:48,900
I also did a lot of like online.

1649
02:46:48,900 --> 02:46:50,900
Like, you know like Flipno Hatena?

1650
02:46:52,900 --> 02:46:53,900
Give me your fucking-

1651
02:46:54,900 --> 02:46:55,900
Fuck!

1652
02:46:56,900 --> 02:46:57,900
I couldn't shoot this girl.

1653
02:46:58,900 --> 02:47:01,900
So you could do a lot of like-

1654
02:47:02,900 --> 02:47:03,900
What's it called?

1655
02:47:06,900 --> 02:47:07,900
I don't know.

1656
02:47:08,900 --> 02:47:09,900
I don't know.

1657
02:47:10,900 --> 02:47:13,900
Like role-playing on Flipnote.

1658
02:47:15,900 --> 02:47:17,900
So I was part of like Ghost Clan and Broken Clan.

1659
02:47:20,900 --> 02:47:21,900
Shout out to Ghost Clan.

1660
02:47:23,900 --> 02:47:24,900
I was in that Warrior Cache channel.

1661
02:47:26,900 --> 02:47:27,900
It's so funny.

1662
02:47:28,900 --> 02:47:30,900
One of the girls that I role-played with, we just-

1663
02:47:31,900 --> 02:47:34,900
We discovered we lived only like 10 minutes away from each other.

1664
02:47:36,900 --> 02:47:37,900
And then we met up and it was so fun.

1665
02:47:37,900 --> 02:47:38,900
Cause we were like-

1666
02:47:39,900 --> 02:47:40,900
Our little parents-

1667
02:47:42,900 --> 02:47:44,900
Wasn't our parents let us hang out or something?

1668
02:47:44,900 --> 02:47:48,900
Although I don't know when my parents will allow me to hang out with some random stranger from on the internet.

1669
02:47:48,900 --> 02:47:50,900
Maybe we just like snuck out.

1670
02:47:50,900 --> 02:47:51,900
We hung out with each other.

1671
02:47:54,900 --> 02:47:55,900
I can't remember.

1672
02:47:55,900 --> 02:47:56,900
We like met at a public place.

1673
02:47:56,900 --> 02:47:57,900
But it was just really cool.

1674
02:47:57,900 --> 02:48:00,900
It was the first time I met one of my online friends.

1675
02:48:00,900 --> 02:48:03,900
It was because we both like Warrior Cats and we were the same age.

1676
02:48:08,900 --> 02:48:11,900
Yeah, I liked Warrior Cats.

1677
02:48:11,900 --> 02:48:13,900
Guardians of the Ghoul was good.

1678
02:48:16,900 --> 02:48:17,900
What else?

1679
02:48:17,900 --> 02:48:18,900
What else?

1680
02:48:22,900 --> 02:48:23,900
She's a Slytherin of Cats.

1681
02:48:23,900 --> 02:48:25,900
It's funny cause I'm actually like a Gryffindor.

1682
02:48:25,900 --> 02:48:28,900
When I did like that Pottermore house sorting.

1683
02:48:30,900 --> 02:48:31,900
So it burned people.

1684
02:48:31,900 --> 02:48:32,900
There's like a fucking weirdo.

1685
02:48:32,900 --> 02:48:33,900
Now I get paid for it.

1686
02:48:33,900 --> 02:48:34,900
I know, right?

1687
02:48:34,900 --> 02:48:35,900
What was a Warrior Cat?

1688
02:48:35,900 --> 02:48:36,900
No, thunder.

1689
02:48:36,900 --> 02:48:37,900
Thunder.

1690
02:48:37,900 --> 02:48:38,900
Thunder.

1691
02:48:38,900 --> 02:48:39,900
Thunder Cats Ho.

1692
02:48:39,900 --> 02:48:42,900
Warrior Cats was a young adult novel.

1693
02:48:55,900 --> 02:48:59,900
And it was almost like Game of Thrones, but cats.

1694
02:49:00,900 --> 02:49:03,900
Cause you had like instead of houses, there were clans.

1695
02:49:03,900 --> 02:49:04,900
And there was different ranking systems.

1696
02:49:04,900 --> 02:49:07,900
You had like your leader, your deputy, your medicine cat,

1697
02:49:07,900 --> 02:49:09,900
who was also the spiritual leader of the clan.

1698
02:49:11,900 --> 02:49:16,900
And it was honestly, despite being a young adult novel,

1699
02:49:16,900 --> 02:49:21,900
looking back, it has some very adult themes in terms of like this one cat

1700
02:49:21,900 --> 02:49:24,900
cheated on another cat and had kids with this cat.

1701
02:49:24,900 --> 02:49:29,900
And he tries and he goes crazy and tries to kill her in a fire and kill her children.

1702
02:49:29,900 --> 02:49:30,900
Like what the fuck?

1703
02:49:30,900 --> 02:49:31,900
That was a kids book?

1704
02:49:31,900 --> 02:49:32,900
Yeah, it was.

1705
02:49:33,900 --> 02:49:34,900
It was fucking great.

1706
02:49:36,900 --> 02:49:39,900
Young adult, but they had them in my elementary school library, right?

1707
02:49:41,900 --> 02:49:42,900
Animorphs?

1708
02:49:42,900 --> 02:49:43,900
Oh, Animorphs was my shit as well.

1709
02:49:43,900 --> 02:49:45,900
I remember watching the TV shows.

1710
02:49:45,900 --> 02:49:49,900
I watched a good, I read a good book, good chunk of Animorphs.

1711
02:49:59,900 --> 02:50:01,900
Okay, I might be quiet so I can focus.

1712
02:50:04,900 --> 02:50:05,900
Okay.

1713
02:50:16,900 --> 02:50:19,900
I forgot that I sometimes I just forget I can use fervor.

1714
02:50:23,900 --> 02:50:27,900
I know I would like finding of Isaac because I like this game.

1715
02:50:27,900 --> 02:50:29,900
Strony was telling me that.

1716
02:50:29,900 --> 02:50:32,900
Oh, I thought I was out of range of that, but I guess not.

1717
02:50:33,900 --> 02:50:34,900
Okay.

1718
02:50:47,900 --> 02:50:49,900
My thumb is starting to hurt for some reason.

1719
02:50:51,900 --> 02:50:52,900
I missed?

1720
02:50:52,900 --> 02:50:53,900
What was that?

1721
02:50:53,900 --> 02:50:54,900
It was a little cheebie.

1722
02:50:54,900 --> 02:50:55,900
What are you doing?

1723
02:50:56,900 --> 02:50:57,900
Cheebie.

1724
02:50:57,900 --> 02:50:59,900
Cheebie, you dumbass.

1725
02:50:59,900 --> 02:51:00,900
You're losing it.

1726
02:51:04,900 --> 02:51:05,900
Oh, fuck me.

1727
02:51:05,900 --> 02:51:06,900
I should have done that.

1728
02:51:11,900 --> 02:51:12,900
I'm so stupid.

1729
02:51:12,900 --> 02:51:14,900
Why am I not talking again?

1730
02:51:22,900 --> 02:51:23,900
Oh, chat disconnected.

1731
02:51:24,900 --> 02:51:25,900
Oh, no.

1732
02:51:26,900 --> 02:51:27,900
Hurry, guys.

1733
02:51:29,900 --> 02:51:30,900
Enter the gun.

1734
02:51:31,900 --> 02:51:32,900
Oh, I got greedy.

1735
02:51:32,900 --> 02:51:33,900
Yeah.

1736
02:51:33,900 --> 02:51:34,900
I got a little greedy.

1737
02:51:35,900 --> 02:51:36,900
Just a smidge.

1738
02:51:39,900 --> 02:51:40,900
Just a smidge.

1739
02:51:40,900 --> 02:51:41,900
Oh, I can hear myself.

1740
02:51:41,900 --> 02:51:42,900
Fuck that.

1741
02:51:48,900 --> 02:51:50,900
I can't voice act right now.

1742
02:51:51,900 --> 02:51:52,900
Where's my thumb hurt?

1743
02:51:52,900 --> 02:51:54,900
I need to pop my thumb.

1744
02:51:55,900 --> 02:51:58,900
I need to pop my thumb loosey.

1745
02:52:00,900 --> 02:52:01,900
Okay.

1746
02:52:01,900 --> 02:52:02,900
Hello?

1747
02:52:07,900 --> 02:52:09,900
I know I'm so close to clutch.

1748
02:52:09,900 --> 02:52:11,900
Of course this bitch got a choke.

1749
02:52:11,900 --> 02:52:12,900
Why is my...

1750
02:52:14,900 --> 02:52:15,900
Live 2D.

1751
02:52:16,900 --> 02:52:18,900
Why are you fucking with me?

1752
02:52:18,900 --> 02:52:20,900
Why am I so white?

1753
02:52:23,900 --> 02:52:24,900
Come on.

1754
02:52:24,900 --> 02:52:25,900
I believe in you.

1755
02:52:28,900 --> 02:52:29,900
Excuse me.

1756
02:52:29,900 --> 02:52:30,900
I'm bad.

1757
02:52:39,900 --> 02:52:41,900
It's getting brighter again.

1758
02:52:49,900 --> 02:52:50,900
My nose.

1759
02:52:50,900 --> 02:52:52,900
I'm so big.

1760
02:52:53,900 --> 02:52:54,900
Let me sit back a little bit.

1761
02:52:55,900 --> 02:52:56,900
It's like a growl.

1762
02:52:59,900 --> 02:53:02,900
I ask myself that question every day.

1763
02:53:05,900 --> 02:53:10,900
That's funny because I haven't been to the beach yet this summer.

1764
02:53:10,900 --> 02:53:13,900
Or really mostly been outside for the last...

1765
02:53:13,900 --> 02:53:16,900
I've been outside, but I just haven't really been going to the beach.

1766
02:53:16,900 --> 02:53:18,900
So I'm very light right now.

1767
02:53:18,900 --> 02:53:21,900
My mom is darker than me.

1768
02:53:21,900 --> 02:53:22,900
My white mother.

1769
02:53:26,900 --> 02:53:28,900
Yeah, I'm gonna go make some food right now.

1770
02:53:28,900 --> 02:53:30,900
I'm gonna go beat that stupid ass boss.

1771
02:53:43,900 --> 02:53:47,900
Because my mom is outside a lot because she got gardens, so she's...

1772
02:53:47,900 --> 02:53:50,900
She's also Portuguese, so...

1773
02:53:51,900 --> 02:53:52,900
Portugues.

1774
02:53:52,900 --> 02:53:54,900
So she's tan as well.

1775
02:53:55,900 --> 02:53:56,900
There we go.

1776
02:54:03,900 --> 02:54:06,900
So my mom and my dad make fun of me a lot.

1777
02:54:07,900 --> 02:54:09,900
My dad calls me his white child.

1778
02:54:13,900 --> 02:54:14,900
And then my mom's like,

1779
02:54:14,900 --> 02:54:15,900
Well, she is white!

1780
02:54:18,900 --> 02:54:23,900
And he's like, yeah, but my melanin should take precedent.

1781
02:54:25,900 --> 02:54:27,900
Dang, me look angry.

1782
02:54:30,900 --> 02:54:33,900
I think my Wi-Fi is like struggling a little bit

1783
02:54:33,900 --> 02:54:37,900
because I have to have it on Wi-Fi when I use my controller

1784
02:54:37,900 --> 02:54:39,900
because I only have one USB-C connection.

1785
02:54:44,900 --> 02:54:47,900
Now I'm just gonna look really shocked the entire time.

1786
02:54:47,900 --> 02:54:53,900
And again, I only freeze on this thing for some reason.

1787
02:54:53,900 --> 02:54:55,900
It's so weird.

1788
02:54:58,900 --> 02:55:01,900
I don't care that you're starving. Get away from me.

1789
02:55:01,900 --> 02:55:03,900
You little whiny bitches.

1790
02:55:06,900 --> 02:55:08,900
I don't know about that right now.

1791
02:55:09,900 --> 02:55:10,900
I need more beds.

1792
02:55:16,900 --> 02:55:18,900
I don't have enough beds for any of you.

1793
02:55:24,900 --> 02:55:26,900
Most intensive menu.

1794
02:55:28,900 --> 02:55:31,900
That's never happened before too when I streamed this.

1795
02:55:34,900 --> 02:55:36,900
Do you have cable from your controller?

1796
02:55:36,900 --> 02:55:39,900
Yeah, I have a USB-C going into my PC.

1797
02:55:40,900 --> 02:55:43,900
But I only have one USB-C on my PC.

1798
02:55:53,900 --> 02:55:55,900
It's nice because there's so many of you.

1799
02:55:59,900 --> 02:56:01,900
I can do double stuff.

1800
02:56:07,900 --> 02:56:09,900
Come on, get me to the top.

1801
02:56:09,900 --> 02:56:10,900
Yes, thank you.

1802
02:56:15,900 --> 02:56:17,900
The menu is consuming all the PC resources.

1803
02:56:18,900 --> 02:56:21,900
I didn't want to ask for another PC

1804
02:56:21,900 --> 02:56:23,900
when I was hired on.

1805
02:56:25,900 --> 02:56:27,900
I forgot who got a PC.

1806
02:56:30,900 --> 02:56:32,900
I didn't ask either.

1807
02:56:32,900 --> 02:56:34,900
Because he uses a laptop.

1808
02:56:35,900 --> 02:56:37,900
We're too nice.

1809
02:56:37,900 --> 02:56:40,900
They were just like, we'll buy you a 3DO, a PC, a mic.

1810
02:56:40,900 --> 02:56:43,900
And I'm like, no, I'm good. Just give me the 3DO.

1811
02:56:46,900 --> 02:56:48,900
One thing for doctrine.

1812
02:56:52,900 --> 02:56:55,900
Yeah, I built my PC back in 2017.

1813
02:57:00,900 --> 02:57:02,900
She has not been updated for quite a bit.

1814
02:57:04,900 --> 02:57:06,900
Yeah, oh yeah, we get spoiled.

1815
02:57:07,900 --> 02:57:09,900
Mommy and management spoilers.

1816
02:57:18,900 --> 02:57:20,900
I need bones.

1817
02:57:22,900 --> 02:57:23,900
Okay.

1818
02:57:25,900 --> 02:57:27,900
I can't do it because I don't got bones.

1819
02:57:32,900 --> 02:57:34,900
Oh, okay, now I can.

1820
02:57:40,900 --> 02:57:42,900
Collect reward from Strani.

1821
02:57:42,900 --> 02:57:44,900
Where is my little mother?

1822
02:57:46,900 --> 02:57:48,900
Mother, I need to speak to you.

1823
02:57:49,900 --> 02:57:50,900
Mom.

1824
02:57:50,900 --> 02:57:52,900
No, not Saber.

1825
02:57:52,900 --> 02:57:54,900
Strani, please.

1826
02:57:58,900 --> 02:57:59,900
Cool.

1827
02:58:01,900 --> 02:58:03,900
I can't wait to unlock fishing.

1828
02:58:04,900 --> 02:58:06,900
Because then I can just fish for hours and just talk to you guys.

1829
02:58:06,900 --> 02:58:07,900
Yeah, while fishing.

1830
02:58:08,900 --> 02:58:10,900
Oh, you look kind of cute just sitting there.

1831
02:58:10,900 --> 02:58:12,900
Get the fucking to work though.

1832
02:58:19,900 --> 02:58:22,900
Actually, I think there's actually nothing you can do.

1833
02:58:22,900 --> 02:58:24,900
Everything's taken up.

1834
02:58:26,900 --> 02:58:27,900
2008 here.

1835
02:58:28,900 --> 02:58:29,900
Jesus.

1836
02:58:29,900 --> 02:58:31,900
Do you need RAM then?

1837
02:58:32,900 --> 02:58:34,900
What do you mean, download RAM?

1838
02:58:35,900 --> 02:58:36,900
What?

1839
02:58:38,900 --> 02:58:40,900
Rounds well upgrade for a year from now.

1840
02:58:41,900 --> 02:58:43,900
I'll probably, like, when I get more established,

1841
02:58:43,900 --> 02:58:45,900
stop grumbling because you're hungry.

1842
02:58:45,900 --> 02:58:47,900
I'll just buy my own PC.

1843
02:58:47,900 --> 02:58:52,900
I just, I don't, I'd rather have the funds go to Gen 2

1844
02:58:52,900 --> 02:58:58,900
or go to, like, 3D or just go to

1845
02:59:00,900 --> 02:59:02,900
making, oh my god, you guys are legit starving,

1846
02:59:02,900 --> 02:59:04,900
but I don't have anything to give you.

1847
02:59:06,900 --> 02:59:07,900
Can I build a farm?

1848
02:59:07,900 --> 02:59:09,900
Hold on, let me see if I can build a farm first.

1849
02:59:18,900 --> 02:59:20,900
I seriously can't build a farm yet.

1850
02:59:22,900 --> 02:59:23,900
Dumb.

1851
02:59:27,900 --> 02:59:28,900
Oh wait, there it is.

1852
02:59:28,900 --> 02:59:30,900
Because I'm like, I think I have not a bright spot.

1853
02:59:31,900 --> 02:59:34,900
I do not have enough coins.

1854
02:59:35,900 --> 02:59:37,900
All right, some of you are going to die.

1855
02:59:37,900 --> 02:59:38,900
Sorry.

1856
02:59:39,900 --> 02:59:40,900
Yeah, go to sleep.

1857
02:59:40,900 --> 02:59:41,900
Die in your sleep.

1858
02:59:42,900 --> 02:59:43,900
It'll be fine.

1859
02:59:47,900 --> 02:59:48,900
$50.90.

1860
02:59:48,900 --> 02:59:50,900
I think I have a $10.70 in my computer.

1861
02:59:51,900 --> 02:59:55,900
I have a, I don't remember, do I have a $7.20 watt?

1862
02:59:58,900 --> 02:59:59,900
Power supply.

1863
03:00:00,900 --> 03:00:01,900
I don't have a $7.20 watt.

1864
03:00:02,900 --> 03:00:03,900
I don't have a $7.20 watt.

1865
03:00:03,900 --> 03:00:04,900
Do I have a $7.20 watt?

1866
03:00:07,900 --> 03:00:08,900
Power supply.

1867
03:00:09,900 --> 03:00:11,900
32 gigs of RAM.

1868
03:00:12,900 --> 03:00:14,900
I think it's DDR4.

1869
03:00:15,900 --> 03:00:16,900
It's a DDR5, I don't know.

1870
03:00:19,900 --> 03:00:24,900
I have a risen 2700.

1871
03:00:25,900 --> 03:00:27,900
I can't remember if it's 2700X or not.

1872
03:00:30,900 --> 03:00:32,900
But yeah, she needs to upgrade.

1873
03:00:33,900 --> 03:00:36,900
I've also just been too lazy to build a PC.

1874
03:00:36,900 --> 03:00:43,900
I'd rather just like, like I, I almost went to for computer engineering in school because I really enjoyed building PCs.

1875
03:00:44,900 --> 03:00:53,900
I remember I, um, my friend bent the pins on their computer so I was able to fix it and like solder it and all that shit.

1876
03:00:55,900 --> 03:00:59,900
That was really fun, but I'm way too lazy to build my PC again.

1877
03:00:59,900 --> 03:01:02,900
Although I think if even if I get a pre-built, I'll have to build it, but whatever.

1878
03:01:03,900 --> 03:01:10,900
And if, if that's the case, then I'll probably just end up building it myself and like do you like PC par picker?

1879
03:01:10,900 --> 03:01:14,900
Feel free to like give me suggestions on my marrows or whatever.

1880
03:01:18,900 --> 03:01:19,900
45.

1881
03:01:21,900 --> 03:01:23,900
I feel like a big, little big planet.

1882
03:01:23,900 --> 03:01:25,900
A risen, risen, I don't know.

1883
03:01:28,900 --> 03:01:29,900
Risen.

1884
03:01:29,900 --> 03:01:31,900
I always call it a risen.

1885
03:01:31,900 --> 03:01:33,900
Is it not, is it rising or risen?

1886
03:01:33,900 --> 03:01:34,900
I'll be risen you up.

1887
03:01:34,900 --> 03:01:35,900
That's for sure.

1888
03:01:35,900 --> 03:01:37,900
My mouth's not moving again, but it's fine.

1889
03:01:39,900 --> 03:01:40,900
I'm like moving my face around.

1890
03:01:40,900 --> 03:01:41,900
Nothing's happening.

1891
03:01:44,900 --> 03:01:45,900
Risen.

1892
03:01:46,900 --> 03:01:47,900
Risen.

1893
03:01:48,900 --> 03:01:49,900
A risen.

1894
03:01:54,900 --> 03:01:55,900
Risen.

1895
03:01:55,900 --> 03:01:56,900
Risen.

1896
03:01:57,900 --> 03:01:59,900
Cause it's like, isn't it risen?

1897
03:01:59,900 --> 03:02:00,900
Like it's been risen.

1898
03:02:00,900 --> 03:02:04,900
Like the, you know, Jesus has risen on the third day, that type of thing.

1899

2084
03:14:09,160 --> 03:14:13,160
I can't get to it cause you're all just fucking standing around it.

2085
03:14:14,160 --> 03:14:16,160
Perfect. Let's harvest your meat.

2086
03:14:24,160 --> 03:14:26,160
Yeah we're gonna harvest your meat.

2087
03:14:29,160 --> 03:14:32,160
Oh fuck I didn't do it right.

2088
03:14:32,160 --> 03:14:34,160
Right. Oh whatever.

2089
03:14:38,160 --> 03:14:40,160
Fuck where should we have the funeral shit?

2090
03:14:41,160 --> 03:14:43,160
Stop. No Azura!

2091
03:14:46,160 --> 03:14:49,160
No Azura. Somebody revive Azura please.

2092
03:14:52,160 --> 03:14:54,160
Oh my fucking god.

2093
03:14:56,160 --> 03:14:58,160
Thank god. Thank you.

2094
03:14:58,160 --> 03:15:00,160
She's like yeah I'm great.

2095
03:15:01,160 --> 03:15:03,160
Stop fucking dying.

2096
03:15:08,160 --> 03:15:10,160
Stop fucking dying.

2097
03:15:16,160 --> 03:15:18,160
Can you all stop?

2098
03:15:19,160 --> 03:15:21,160
Okay perfect.

2099
03:15:21,160 --> 03:15:24,160
Oh see you guys can just keep reviving yourself.

2100
03:15:24,160 --> 03:15:26,160
More meat for the grinder.

2101
03:15:26,160 --> 03:15:29,160
I'm definitely gonna get the thing that if you guys eat yourselves then you'll be fine.

2102
03:15:29,160 --> 03:15:31,160
Okay so we got that. All that's good.

2103
03:15:31,160 --> 03:15:35,160
I could do that. I need to get a prison.

2104
03:15:35,160 --> 03:15:37,160
Ooh prison.

2105
03:15:41,160 --> 03:15:43,160
I need a summoning circle.

2106
03:15:43,160 --> 03:15:45,160
When do I get a fucking toilet?

2107
03:15:48,160 --> 03:15:49,160
What?

2108
03:15:53,160 --> 03:15:55,160
What's that? Basic decorations?

2109
03:15:55,160 --> 03:15:57,160
All right well.

2110
03:16:00,160 --> 03:16:02,160
I'm making myself dizzy.

2111
03:16:02,160 --> 03:16:04,160
I'm free statue.

2112
03:16:04,160 --> 03:16:06,160
I guess I'll get you guys better beds.

2113
03:16:06,160 --> 03:16:08,160
No actually no I need these first.

2114
03:16:08,160 --> 03:16:10,160
Yeah I need these first desperately.

2115
03:16:11,160 --> 03:16:14,160
I'm gonna start with stone.

2116
03:16:14,160 --> 03:16:16,160
Cause it's really hard to get stone.

2117
03:16:17,160 --> 03:16:19,160
Sometimes.

2118
03:16:23,160 --> 03:16:25,160
You can revive unless you harvest the meat.

2119
03:16:25,160 --> 03:16:27,160
Okay gotcha. Zero deaths.

2120
03:16:27,160 --> 03:16:29,160
Zero deaths everyone.

2121
03:16:33,160 --> 03:16:42,160
I know you guys some of you guys will leave too when the faith's been low for a long time.

2122
03:16:45,160 --> 03:16:47,160
Time for a seven.

2123
03:16:50,160 --> 03:16:53,160
I guess you guys are all just shit everywhere then.

2124
03:16:53,160 --> 03:16:55,160
Okay.

2125
03:17:03,160 --> 03:17:05,160
It's crude ice blessing.

2126
03:17:08,160 --> 03:17:10,160
Yeah I don't care about that.

2127
03:17:13,160 --> 03:17:15,160
I'm gonna do this one.

2128
03:17:16,160 --> 03:17:18,160
Being first.

2129
03:17:18,160 --> 03:17:21,160
Imagine yeah just getting starved to death and revive.

2130
03:17:21,160 --> 03:17:23,160
The starving to death and reviving again.

2131
03:17:26,160 --> 03:17:28,160
Kind of fucked up.

2132
03:17:35,160 --> 03:17:37,160
You guys look all piss.

2133
03:17:37,160 --> 03:17:39,160
You're like we need fucking...

2134
03:17:40,160 --> 03:17:42,160
This guy called us diabolic.

2135
03:17:42,160 --> 03:17:44,160
This guy called us diabolic.

2136
03:17:44,160 --> 03:17:46,160
Well there's too many of you.

2137
03:17:56,160 --> 03:17:58,160
So much you can take from them.

2138
03:18:00,160 --> 03:18:02,160
I can give you gifts.

2139
03:18:02,160 --> 03:18:04,160
I can't wait to like be able to yell at you.

2140
03:18:12,160 --> 03:18:14,160
Yep yep yep yep.

2141
03:18:16,160 --> 03:18:18,160
Cause I can do intimidation.

2142
03:18:19,160 --> 03:18:21,160
We can play that game.

2143
03:18:21,160 --> 03:18:23,160
The dice game.

2144
03:18:30,160 --> 03:18:32,160
I fucking love this game so much.

2145
03:18:36,160 --> 03:18:39,160
I still have to do this guy.

2146
03:18:39,160 --> 03:18:41,160
Sounds weird.

2147
03:18:42,160 --> 03:18:44,160
What's up Saber?

2148
03:18:45,160 --> 03:18:47,160
Cook grass meals.

2149
03:18:47,160 --> 03:18:49,160
I will accept that.

2150
03:18:50,160 --> 03:18:53,160
Might get the grass treat as well.

2151
03:18:53,160 --> 03:18:54,160
What?

2152
03:18:54,160 --> 03:18:56,160
I don't have any grass.

2153
03:18:57,160 --> 03:18:59,160
What the hell?

2154
03:19:00,160 --> 03:19:02,160
You guys can fight over that.

2155
03:19:04,160 --> 03:19:06,160
Can I build shit?

2156
03:19:08,160 --> 03:19:11,160
Okay I'm gonna build fucker.

2157
03:19:12,160 --> 03:19:14,160

2158
03:19:18,160 --> 03:19:20,160
Okay you bitches build that.

2159
03:19:22,160 --> 03:19:24,160
Oh my god scrumptious nightmare.

2160
03:19:24,160 --> 03:19:26,160
No!

2161
03:19:30,160 --> 03:19:32,160
Let's don't fucking vomit.

2162
03:19:32,160 --> 03:19:34,160
Oh my god stop vomiting.

2163
03:19:38,160 --> 03:19:40,160

2164
03:19:43,160 --> 03:19:45,160

2165
03:19:45,160 --> 03:19:47,160
Throw you over here.

2166
03:19:48,160 --> 03:19:50,160
For now.

2167
03:19:56,160 --> 03:19:58,160
Okay.

2168
03:19:59,160 --> 03:20:01,160
My rabbit is deceased.

2169
03:20:06,160 --> 03:20:09,160
Why am I just like standing awkwardly?

2170
03:20:13,160 --> 03:20:15,160
That's my tracking lens.

2171
03:20:15,160 --> 03:20:17,160
No!

2172
03:20:20,160 --> 03:20:22,160
Everybody's dying.

2173
03:20:22,160 --> 03:20:24,160
Why the fuck you dying?

2174
03:20:25,160 --> 03:20:27,160
Why the fuck you dying?

2175
03:20:28,160 --> 03:20:31,160
Oh my god stop fucking dying.

2176
03:20:32,160 --> 03:20:34,160
Come on E hold on.

2177
03:20:36,160 --> 03:20:38,160
She literally died and vomit.

2178
03:20:42,160 --> 03:20:45,160
Sweet. I'm like you guys don't call me a viper so I'm not too worried.

2179
03:20:48,160 --> 03:20:50,160
Ah hold on stroney.

2180
03:20:52,160 --> 03:20:54,160

2181
03:20:58,160 --> 03:20:59,160
No.

2182
03:20:59,160 --> 03:21:01,160
Oh my god I'm gonna try to fix.

2183
03:21:02,160 --> 03:21:04,160
I will.

2184
03:21:04,160 --> 03:21:06,160
No.

2185
03:21:06,160 --> 03:21:08,160
Hi stroney.

2186
03:21:09,160 --> 03:21:12,160
Oh my god can you guys like stop?

2187
03:21:12,160 --> 03:21:14,160
You guys are being so dramatic.

2188
03:21:16,160 --> 03:21:18,160
What the hell? I can't move.

2189
03:21:21,160 --> 03:21:23,160
Controller?

2190
03:21:28,160 --> 03:21:30,160
Here we go.

2191
03:21:32,160 --> 03:21:33,160
No!

2192
03:21:33,160 --> 03:21:35,160
Stroney!

2193
03:21:38,160 --> 03:21:42,160
Stroney why do you have to be the one to dissent against me?

2194
03:21:46,160 --> 03:21:47,160
No!

2195
03:21:47,160 --> 03:21:49,160
Stroney stop!

2196
03:21:56,160 --> 03:21:59,160
Stroney I don't want to throw you in prison.

2197
03:21:59,160 --> 03:22:01,160
When I make a prison.

2198
03:22:04,160 --> 03:22:06,160
Hey everybody just pass out.

2199
03:22:09,160 --> 03:22:11,160
I'm surrounded by cults.

2200
03:22:11,160 --> 03:22:13,160
Stop mommy stop!

2201
03:22:13,160 --> 03:22:15,160
No mom don't hit me down!

2202
03:22:18,160 --> 03:22:21,160
Why the fuck you dying?

2203
03:22:25,160 --> 03:22:27,160
Everybody should be against me.

2204
03:22:29,160 --> 03:22:31,160
Okay that school coming along nicely.

2205
03:22:32,160 --> 03:22:34,160
Come here!

2206
03:22:37,160 --> 03:22:39,160
You guys can wake up and eat me.

2207
03:22:42,160 --> 03:22:45,160
One of you will be lucky enough to wake up and eat that.

2208
03:22:46,160 --> 03:22:48,160
Thank you later.

2209
03:22:50,160 --> 03:22:52,160
Build more beds.

2210
03:22:53,160 --> 03:22:55,160
Okay I'll do that.

2211
03:22:56,160 --> 03:22:59,160
One of you guys will be able to have a bed.

2212
03:23:02,160 --> 03:23:04,160
Too many mouths to feed.

2213
03:23:08,160 --> 03:23:10,160
You know what must be done.

2214
03:23:10,160 --> 03:23:12,160
I'm not killing stroney.

2215
03:23:12,160 --> 03:23:14,160
I'm not betraying my own mother.

2216
03:23:14,160 --> 03:23:16,160
Why am I asleep?

2217
03:23:17,160 --> 03:23:20,160
Why am I asleep in the corner?

2218
03:23:20,160 --> 03:23:23,160
Why am I asleep in the corner?

2219
03:23:29,160 --> 03:23:31,160
Oh my god please.

2220
03:23:35,160 --> 03:23:36,160
My piece of my PC.

2221
03:23:36,160 --> 03:23:39,160
My internet has like not behaved since yesterday.

2222
03:23:41,160 --> 03:23:42,160
It's really weird.

2223
03:23:42,160 --> 03:23:44,160
I don't know why it's doing that.

2224
03:23:44,160 --> 03:23:46,160
My fit rate was terrible yesterday.

2225
03:23:51,160 --> 03:23:53,160
I hate saying this but you stop working again.

2226
03:23:53,160 --> 03:23:55,160
Hey I'm just a PNGTuber.

2227
03:23:56,160 --> 03:23:58,160
It's fine to worry about it.

2228
03:23:58,160 --> 03:24:00,160
My fucking face.

2229
03:24:02,160 --> 03:24:06,160
I'm just saying stroney wouldn't make a starved to death a bunch of you know.

2230
03:24:06,160 --> 03:24:07,160
I know she's gonna play it.

2231
03:24:07,160 --> 03:24:09,160
I think she's playing this in a couple weeks.

2232
03:24:09,160 --> 03:24:11,160
She's gonna have a better run than I am.

2233
03:24:11,160 --> 03:24:13,160
One because she's sick at fighting of Isaac.

2234
03:24:13,160 --> 03:24:15,160
So this will be easy for her.

2235
03:24:15,160 --> 03:24:19,160
Stealing us.

2236
03:24:21,160 --> 03:24:23,160
Ooh I get big berries.

2352
03:34:10,860 --> 03:34:15,860

2353
03:34:18,860 --> 03:34:20,860
Do not back me in a motherf**king corner.

No, my shoe died.

2362
03:35:05,860 --> 03:35:06,860
Not my shoe.

2363
03:35:10,860 --> 03:35:12,860
How am I gonna step on bitches now?

2364
03:35:21,860 --> 03:35:22,860
Yeah, I need a correct.

2365
03:35:24,860 --> 03:35:25,860
Clap, clap, clap, get corrected, get corrected.

2366
03:35:28,860 --> 03:35:32,860
Hold on, while you do that weird animal thing, I'm just gonna farm cause I know you're super slow.

2367
03:35:32,860 --> 03:35:33,860
I know you're super slow.

2368
03:35:38,860 --> 03:35:39,860
Why am I not getting grass?

2369
03:35:41,860 --> 03:35:43,860
I can't make grassy gruel if I can not even getting any grass.

2370
03:35:44,860 --> 03:35:45,860
Okay, there we go.

2371
03:35:48,860 --> 03:35:51,860
I'm like usually there's like a higher chance of me to farm stuff.

2372
03:35:52,860 --> 03:35:54,860
I wonder if they changed it with update.

2373
03:35:55,860 --> 03:35:56,860
To the right, to the right.

2374
03:36:01,860 --> 03:36:02,860
Okay.

2375
03:36:05,860 --> 03:36:07,860
Why would I pick the other one at all?

2376
03:36:11,860 --> 03:36:15,860
So not trying to turn traitor, but can we get a caring cult leader?

2377
03:36:17,860 --> 03:36:18,860
I blame you guys.

2378
03:36:19,860 --> 03:36:21,860
You all decided to spawn it.

2379
03:36:21,860 --> 03:36:22,860
Like little bitches.

2380
03:36:23,860 --> 03:36:24,860
Okay.

2381
03:36:25,860 --> 03:36:27,860
And there's too many mounts to feed.

2382
03:36:30,860 --> 03:36:31,860
It's not my fault.

2383
03:36:32,860 --> 03:36:36,860
The game at this point only anticipates me having like five followers.

2384
03:36:51,860 --> 03:36:52,860
Ooh.

2385
03:36:53,860 --> 03:36:55,860
I got a necklace thingamabobba.

2386
03:36:56,860 --> 03:36:58,860
I can't, I was like trying to hit that like I could.

2387
03:37:00,860 --> 03:37:02,860
I'm not even using fervor.

2388
03:37:03,860 --> 03:37:05,860
We demand work benefits, you thought.

2389
03:37:14,860 --> 03:37:16,860
Fuck this fucking little bat shit.

2390
03:37:16,860 --> 03:37:18,860
I need a drink water.

2391
03:37:22,860 --> 03:37:23,860
Don't worry.

2392
03:37:23,860 --> 03:37:26,860
You guys are going to have some delicious grassy gruel in a moment.

2393
03:37:27,860 --> 03:37:29,860
I might have to get the grassy like eating grass trait.

2394
03:37:31,860 --> 03:37:34,860
At this rate because there's too many of you guys to feed.

2395
03:37:37,860 --> 03:37:39,860
Was there another way I could have gone?

2396
03:37:39,860 --> 03:37:42,860
I think there's like a maximum of only six or seven rooms, right?

2397
03:37:42,860 --> 03:37:43,860
Yeah, there was.

2398
03:37:43,860 --> 03:37:44,860
Okay.

2399
03:37:44,860 --> 03:37:45,860
What can we say?

2400
03:37:45,860 --> 03:37:48,860
Wonderland's getting good business in the swelma perks after our stay.

2401
03:37:49,860 --> 03:37:50,860
Guys, let's unionize.

2402
03:37:50,860 --> 03:37:51,860
Shut up!

2403
03:37:52,860 --> 03:37:55,860
Guys, let's create a self sculpt syndicate.

2404
03:37:55,860 --> 03:37:58,860
To be honest, with the collective brain power of 30 chatters,

2405
03:37:58,860 --> 03:38:01,860
at least one of us should have known how to farm.

2406
03:38:03,860 --> 03:38:04,860
I'm going to have to do this.

2407
03:38:05,860 --> 03:38:06,860
I'm going to have to do this.

2408
03:38:06,860 --> 03:38:07,860
I'm going to have to do this.

2409
03:38:07,860 --> 03:38:08,860
I'm going to have to do this.

2410
03:38:08,860 --> 03:38:09,860
I'm going to have to do this.

2411
03:38:09,860 --> 03:38:10,860
I'm going to have to do this.

2412
03:38:10,860 --> 03:38:11,860
I'm going to have to do this.

2413
03:38:11,860 --> 03:38:16,860
OK, let me get another drink real quick.

2414
03:38:18,860 --> 03:38:19,860
Oops.

2415
03:38:19,860 --> 03:38:20,860
Sorry, Reena, it didn't scare you.

2416
03:38:24,860 --> 03:38:25,860
Ow!

2417
03:38:26,860 --> 03:38:28,860
Oh, he's our rice table.

2418
03:38:37,860 --> 03:38:38,860
I have time to stretch.

2419
03:38:38,860 --> 03:38:40,500
Huhu......

2420
03:38:43,620 --> 03:38:45,240
I hate you.

2421
03:38:46,180 --> 03:38:47,360
What are you doing?

2422
03:38:52,080 --> 03:38:53,280

Guys, I'm tactically refilling my food.

2460
03:41:33,120 --> 03:41:35,120
Maybe I'm going to heal, not needing followers.

2461
03:41:35,120 --> 03:41:40,120
I'm going to be real, not eating followers should have been the call 14 runs ago.

2462
03:41:43,120 --> 03:41:45,120
Yeah, well.

2463
03:41:46,120 --> 03:41:50,120
What can you do? I didn't know you'd all want to spawn in.

2464
03:41:53,120 --> 03:41:55,120
Yeah.

2465
03:42:06,120 --> 03:42:08,120
Oh shit.

2466
03:42:11,120 --> 03:42:13,120
Can I make it?

2467
03:42:14,120 --> 03:42:16,120
Can I make a stab you?

2468
03:42:20,120 --> 03:42:22,120
I can't.

2469
03:42:22,120 --> 03:42:25,120
Trying to get it to stab the thing.

2470
03:42:25,120 --> 03:42:27,120
Oh wait, I'm going to do this.

2471
03:42:27,120 --> 03:42:29,120
I'm dirt.

2472
03:42:32,120 --> 03:42:34,120
I knew that was going to get me.

2473
03:42:34,120 --> 03:42:36,120
I didn't realize the animation would last so long.

2474
03:42:36,120 --> 03:42:38,120
Oh shit.

2475
03:42:52,120 --> 03:42:55,120
I like the noise it makes when you have no more fervor.

2476
03:43:00,120 --> 03:43:03,120
See, I could, what do I have right now?

2477
03:43:03,120 --> 03:43:05,120
I don't think I have a pair of guts.

2478
03:43:07,120 --> 03:43:09,120
Let's get bones.

2479
03:43:10,120 --> 03:43:12,120
I'm looking to get bones.

2480
03:43:12,120 --> 03:43:14,120
No, let's fuck me.

2481
03:43:14,120 --> 03:43:16,120
Nevermind.

2482
03:43:22,120 --> 03:43:24,120
What the hell?

2483
03:43:24,120 --> 03:43:26,120
Oh, I forgot.

2484
03:43:27,120 --> 03:43:29,120
Fuck.

2485
03:43:29,120 --> 03:43:31,120
Fuck.

2486
03:43:35,120 --> 03:43:39,120
I never got the point of that weird ass bird thing, to be honest with you.

2487
03:43:39,120 --> 03:43:41,120
What the hell?

2488
03:43:48,120 --> 03:43:50,120
Let's do this.

2489
03:43:58,120 --> 03:44:00,120
Hey.

2490
03:44:00,120 --> 03:44:02,120
What's up? It's your voice.

2491
03:44:02,120 --> 03:44:04,120
Any penis?

2492
03:44:05,120 --> 03:44:09,120
I'm here to skate fast and eat your mom's ass.

2493
03:44:13,120 --> 03:44:15,120
St. Paul.

2494
03:44:15,120 --> 03:44:17,120
So is anyone else dreaming of food while they sleep?

2495
03:44:17,120 --> 03:44:19,120
Shut up.

2496
03:44:20,120 --> 03:44:22,120
Quit your whining.

2497
03:44:22,120 --> 03:44:25,120
I am the best cult eater ever.

2498
03:44:26,120 --> 03:44:30,120
I heard bodies in these rocks.

2499
03:44:31,120 --> 03:44:34,120
Oh wait, no, they're like bags of people.

2500
03:44:34,120 --> 03:44:36,120
Aw, that sucks.

2501
03:44:53,120 --> 03:44:57,120
Don't worry, I'm going to make you the best grass food when I get back to camp, okay guys?

2502
03:44:57,120 --> 03:44:59,120
So like everything will be fine.

2503
03:45:01,120 --> 03:45:03,120
Okay.

2504
03:45:09,120 --> 03:45:12,120
It's crumbling stuff, it's coming from the end approaches.

2505
03:45:15,120 --> 03:45:17,120
Yeah, let me get some stone.

2506
03:45:18,120 --> 03:45:20,120
Get a little stone, you know?

2507
03:45:20,120 --> 03:45:22,120
Give me fucking squirrel.

2508
03:45:22,120 --> 03:45:24,120
Okay, bye.

2509
03:45:25,120 --> 03:45:28,120
Camilla flowers are good for when you guys get sick.

2510
03:45:28,120 --> 03:45:30,120
So I'm going to snatch those up real quick.

2511
03:45:35,120 --> 03:45:37,120
Umi is giving Reina kisses below me.

2512
03:45:37,120 --> 03:45:38,120
It's very adorable.

2513
03:45:38,120 --> 03:45:40,120
You guys are missing out.

2514
03:45:41,120 --> 03:45:42,120
Pop the grass.

2515
03:45:42,120 --> 03:45:44,120
Are you more going to miss anything?

2516
03:45:44,120 --> 03:45:46,120
No, I'm good.

2517
03:45:48,120 --> 03:45:50,120
Just dreaming of rural.

2518
03:45:50,120 --> 03:45:52,120
This playthrough is just normal.

2519
03:45:53,120 --> 03:45:55,120
Oh my god, Jesus fuck.

2520
03:46:00,120 --> 03:46:02,120
You're fucked, mate, you're done.

2521
03:46:04,120 --> 03:46:06,120
The strong, he says, you're done.

2522
03:46:06,120 --> 03:46:08,120
You're done.

2523
03:46:08,120 --> 03:46:10,120
She loves saying that, it's adorable.

2524
03:46:23,120 --> 03:46:26,120
Ah, my nose edges.

2525
03:46:29,120 --> 03:46:31,120
I'm trying to scratch my nose.

2526
03:46:44,120 --> 03:46:46,120
I'm sick.

2527
03:46:46,120 --> 03:46:48,120
Ooh, I can get some nice flooring, guys.

2528
03:46:48,120 --> 03:46:50,120
Oh my god.

2529
03:46:50,120 --> 03:46:52,120
Are you excited? I'm excited.

2530
03:46:52,120 --> 03:46:54,120
I'm going to make it real pretty for us.

2531
03:46:54,120 --> 03:46:56,120
So we're going to have a really nice time.

2532
03:46:58,120 --> 03:47:00,120
I love interior decorating and call to the lamp.

2533
03:47:03,120 --> 03:47:06,120
Make it a really pretty place for us all to hang out, you know?

2534
03:47:06,120 --> 03:47:08,120
No.

2535
03:47:19,120 --> 03:47:21,120
Why do you shoot stuff?

2536
03:47:21,120 --> 03:47:23,120
Did they give you that power?

2537
03:47:24,120 --> 03:47:26,120
That's fucked.

2538
03:47:30,120 --> 03:47:33,120
I like kind of what I have going, so I'm not going to pick anything up.

2539
03:47:36,120 --> 03:47:39,120
I couldn't do the quest because I'm busy.

2540
03:47:45,120 --> 03:47:47,120
Busy trying to get you guys food.

2541
03:47:50,120 --> 03:47:52,120
All you guys do is bitch and moan.

2542
03:47:53,120 --> 03:47:55,120
How I don't feed you.

2543
03:47:55,120 --> 03:47:57,120
Oh, hi Serenity.

2544
03:47:58,120 --> 03:48:00,120
How are you doing, Serenity? What's up?

2545
03:48:00,120 --> 03:48:02,120
My favorite bunny girl.

2546
03:48:02,120 --> 03:48:04,120
Welcome to the Irish Famine.

2547
03:48:04,120 --> 03:48:06,120
To Shime Pougaloo.

2548
03:48:06,120 --> 03:48:08,120
Got someone raiding.

2549
03:48:08,120 --> 03:48:10,120
Oh, did you?

2550
03:48:10,120 --> 03:48:12,120
Serenity, raid us?

2551
03:48:14,120 --> 03:48:16,120
I wish I got an alarm when that happened.

2552
03:48:18,120 --> 03:48:22,120
Well, this game of sometimes music is like a mosquito in my room at 5 a.m.

2553
03:48:27,120 --> 03:48:29,120
Why, you don't like that?

2554
03:48:29,120 --> 03:48:31,120
We're not in the death loop.

2555
03:48:31,120 --> 03:48:33,120
What are you talking about?

2556
03:48:33,120 --> 03:48:35,120
I think there have been dice over here.

2557
03:48:35,120 --> 03:48:37,120
Yeah, you guys are fine.

2558
03:48:39,120 --> 03:48:41,120
Serenity, what were you streaming?

2559
03:48:42,120 --> 03:48:44,120
Yeah, that's what I've been saying.

2560
03:48:44,120 --> 03:48:46,120
It's their fault for starving.

2561
03:48:46,120 --> 03:48:48,120
They all, like, I have crowd control on.

2562
03:48:48,120 --> 03:48:51,120
They all decided to spawn at the same fucking time.

2563
03:48:51,120 --> 03:48:53,120
You know?

2564
03:48:53,120 --> 03:48:55,120
I think I'm actually...

2565
03:48:55,120 --> 03:48:57,120
Should I go with the...

2566
03:48:58,120 --> 03:49:00,120
I'll try to...

2567
03:49:02,120 --> 03:49:04,120
Actually, all my stuff just goes down.

2568
03:49:04,120 --> 03:49:06,120
So I'm not gonna bother with that.

2569
03:49:11,120 --> 03:49:13,120
It's a fervor.

2570
03:49:16,120 --> 03:49:18,120
They're all for starving.

2571
03:49:19,120 --> 03:49:21,120
Hey, you decided to join this cult

2572
03:49:21,120 --> 03:49:24,120
and spend your hard-earned coins.

2573
03:49:25,120 --> 03:49:27,120
And so you chose death.

2574
03:49:27,120 --> 03:49:29,120
It's not up to me.

2575
03:49:33,120 --> 03:49:35,120
It's not up to me.

2576
03:49:37,120 --> 03:49:41,120
It's up to, you know, the gods, the old gods.

2577
03:49:41,120 --> 03:49:43,120
Iron Reaper died again.

2578
03:49:43,120 --> 03:49:45,120
It's fine, don't worry about it.

2579
03:49:45,120 --> 03:49:47,120
Stop fucking dying.

2580
03:49:47,120 --> 03:49:49,120
You guys could, like, stop dying, that'd be great.

2581
03:49:50,120 --> 03:49:53,120
And you want some of this grass-fed long pig?

2582
03:49:54,120 --> 03:49:55,120
Stay dead.

2583
03:49:55,120 --> 03:49:56,120
You wanna starve, eh?

2584
03:49:56,120 --> 03:49:57,120
Yeah, you know?

2585
03:49:57,120 --> 03:49:59,120
Let me know how that goes.

2586
03:49:59,120 --> 03:50:00,120
Look over the corn.

2587
03:50:00,120 --> 03:50:02,120
It's looking mighty appetized.

2588
03:50:02,120 --> 03:50:04,120
All you guys are just role-playing in the chat.

2589
03:50:04,120 --> 03:50:06,120
That's adorable.

2590
03:50:07,120 --> 03:50:09,120
Barbados?

2591
03:50:09,120 --> 03:50:11,120
Oh, he an island gal.

2592
03:50:13,120 --> 03:50:15,120
He's an island gal.

2593
03:50:15,120 --> 03:50:18,120
Okay, well, at least his attacks don't go far.

2594
03:50:24,120 --> 03:50:25,120
Help.

2595
03:50:26,120 --> 03:50:28,120
No, put it a bit too early.

2596
03:50:34,120 --> 03:50:36,120
We're going a little bit farther.

2597
03:50:40,120 --> 03:50:42,120
I'm, like, really bad at tech,

2598
03:50:42,120 --> 03:50:44,120
telling depth of field in this game.

2599
03:50:44,120 --> 03:50:47,120
Like, when they do, like, those long-range attacks.

2600
03:50:50,120 --> 03:50:52,120
Because I still feel like they're going to hit me anyways.

2601
03:50:52,120 --> 03:50:54,120
Oh, I don't know why I spoke like that.

2602
03:50:57,120 --> 03:50:59,120
Just back a little bit.

2603
03:51:02,120 --> 03:51:04,120
It's easy, easy clap.

2604
03:51:04,120 --> 03:51:06,120
Easy, oh fuck.

2605
03:51:08,120 --> 03:51:09,120
Easy clap.

2606
03:51:10,120 --> 03:51:11,120
Easy clap.

2607
03:51:11,120 --> 03:51:12,120
I can't see.

2608
03:51:17,120 --> 03:51:18,120
Can you come over here?

2609
03:51:18,120 --> 03:51:19,120
Thank you.

2610
03:51:19,120 --> 03:51:20,120
Now I can see better.

2611
03:51:22,120 --> 03:51:23,120
It's fine.

2612
03:51:23,120 --> 03:51:24,120
Fine, don't worry about it.

2613
03:51:29,120 --> 03:51:31,120
Ooh, indicated the damage, perfect.

2614
03:51:37,120 --> 03:51:38,120
It's okay.

2615
03:51:39,120 --> 03:51:40,120
It's terrifying.

2616
03:51:40,120 --> 03:51:42,120
I know she's always terrified of death.

2617
03:51:42,120 --> 03:51:45,120
So she just fucking cries every time somebody dies.

2618
03:51:47,120 --> 03:51:49,120
I don't breathe in my face.

2619
03:51:49,120 --> 03:51:52,120
I want the air heating to have some play for her.

2620
03:51:54,120 --> 03:51:56,120
Where's the final looks of the game?

2621
03:51:57,120 --> 03:51:59,120
I don't even know what this thing is to be honest with you.

2622
03:51:59,120 --> 03:52:01,120
I was always confused by what this is.

2623
03:52:01,120 --> 03:52:03,120
It's not like a spider.

2624
03:52:04,120 --> 03:52:05,120
I won't be needing this.

2625
03:52:05,120 --> 03:52:07,120
Yeah, I'm not adding another follower.

2626
03:52:08,120 --> 03:52:10,120
I have two followers to indoctrinate.

2627
03:52:12,120 --> 03:52:14,120
I can't really refine anything yet.

2628
03:52:23,120 --> 03:52:24,120
Hey guys, it's fine.

2629
03:52:24,120 --> 03:52:27,120
I'm coming back with food.

2630
03:52:28,120 --> 03:52:29,120
Oh, they're sleeping bags.

2631
03:52:29,120 --> 03:52:30,120
It's a little spedable.

2632
03:52:33,120 --> 03:52:34,120
Yeah, you guys can use a new follower.

2633
03:52:34,120 --> 03:52:35,120
It's fine.

2634
03:52:36,120 --> 03:52:38,120
You can eat them both.

2635
03:52:38,120 --> 03:52:41,120
I am encouraging cannibals in this hope.

2636
03:52:52,120 --> 03:52:55,120
Yeah, I can't wait to get more doctrines.

2637
03:52:56,120 --> 03:52:58,120
Although I already could tell how hungry and sick they were.

2638
03:52:58,120 --> 03:53:00,120
So I don't know why they're giving me this.

2639
03:53:05,120 --> 03:53:07,120
Kitty, what are you doing?

2640
03:53:07,120 --> 03:53:09,120
When we're attacking the window, it's probably a bug.

2641
03:53:11,120 --> 03:53:12,120
Russian.

2642
03:53:12,120 --> 03:53:14,120
Yes, Russian.

2643
03:53:14,120 --> 03:53:18,120
Speaks Russian back at you.

2644
03:53:20,120 --> 03:53:21,120
Hello.

2645
03:53:22,120 --> 03:53:23,120
Hello.

2646
03:53:25,120 --> 03:53:27,120
Strony, stop being angry.

2647
03:53:27,120 --> 03:53:28,120
Come here.

2648
03:53:30,120 --> 03:53:31,120
No.

2649
03:53:33,120 --> 03:53:34,120
Strony is fucking leaving.

2650
03:53:36,120 --> 03:53:38,120
Oh my god, Strony left.

2651
03:53:38,120 --> 03:53:39,120
No.

2652
03:53:41,120 --> 03:53:43,120
Oh my fucking god.

2653
03:53:43,120 --> 03:53:45,120
Oh my god.

2654
03:53:45,120 --> 03:53:46,120
Oh my god.

2655
03:53:50,120 --> 03:53:51,120
Oh my god.

2656
03:53:55,120 --> 03:53:57,120
Oh my god, I'm so sad.

2657
03:53:57,120 --> 03:53:58,120
Strony left.

2658
03:53:58,120 --> 03:53:59,120
Strony left.

2659
03:54:05,120 --> 03:54:06,120
So fast.

2660
03:54:11,120 --> 03:54:12,120
Oh my god, they're dead.

2661
03:54:15,120 --> 03:54:16,120
Oh my god, they're dead.

2662
03:54:16,120 --> 03:54:17,120
Everybody's fucking...

2663
03:54:28,120 --> 03:54:30,120
I don't want to speak to people.

2664
03:54:35,120 --> 03:54:39,120
Oh god, oh fuck, oh god, oh fuck.

2665
03:54:40,120 --> 03:54:44,120
We might be falling apart just a bit.

2666
03:54:44,120 --> 03:54:46,120
Okay, I'm going to put the...

2667
03:54:47,120 --> 03:54:49,120
What the fuck is that?

2668
03:54:49,120 --> 03:54:51,120
What is this massive golden poop?

2669
03:54:52,120 --> 03:54:54,120
What is this massive golden poop?

2670
03:54:54,120 --> 03:54:56,120
What is this massive golden poop?

2671
03:54:56,120 --> 03:54:58,120
What is this massive golden poop?

2672
03:55:00,120 --> 03:55:01,120
I'm going to put...

2673
03:55:01,120 --> 03:55:03,120
So this will be the farming area.

2674
03:55:03,120 --> 03:55:05,120
So I'll put like the refinery stuff.

2675
03:55:07,120 --> 03:55:08,120
We're here.

2676
03:55:09,120 --> 03:55:11,120
Why can't I place it?

2677
03:55:11,120 --> 03:55:13,120
Why can't I place it there?

2678
03:55:14,120 --> 03:55:16,120
Oh, it's because there's a fucking tree there.

2679
03:55:16,120 --> 03:55:17,120
Are you serious?

2680
03:55:27,120 --> 03:55:28,120
Okay.

2681
03:55:29,120 --> 03:55:32,120
Guys, don't worry, I'm going to make you food.

2682
03:55:33,120 --> 03:55:34,120
Look at this.

2683
03:55:34,120 --> 03:55:36,120
Look at all these berries.

2684
03:55:36,120 --> 03:55:38,120
You guys are going to be able to eat.

2685
03:55:39,120 --> 03:55:41,120
Aren't you going to be so happy?

2686
03:55:47,120 --> 03:55:49,120
Look how far we've come.

2687
03:55:51,120 --> 03:55:53,120
Wait, let me get this giant poop.

2688
03:55:54,120 --> 03:55:56,120
Oh, there's two.

2689
03:56:00,120 --> 03:56:02,120
You guys are all angry and you have no faith.

2690
03:56:13,120 --> 03:56:16,120
I'm trying to harvest as fast as I can.

2691
03:56:17,120 --> 03:56:18,120
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

2692
03:56:18,120 --> 03:56:20,120
Guys, come and get it.

2693
03:56:20,120 --> 03:56:21,120
Oh my God.

2694
03:56:22,120 --> 03:56:23,120
Are you ready?

2695
03:56:27,120 --> 03:56:29,120
Look at all this food.

2696
03:56:31,120 --> 03:56:34,120
This delicious food to eat.

2697
03:56:36,120 --> 03:56:39,120
Well, you're not going to be able to enjoy any.

2698
03:56:40,120 --> 03:56:41,120
Oh my God.

2699
03:56:42,120 --> 03:56:43,120
Where did he go?

2700
03:56:46,120 --> 03:56:48,120
Stop whining and sighing over him.

2701
03:56:48,120 --> 03:56:49,120
He's fine.

2702
03:56:49,120 --> 03:56:50,120
He'll be back in a little bit.

2703
03:56:54,120 --> 03:56:55,120
I need to make a body pit.

2704
03:57:00,120 --> 03:57:01,120
Where's the fucking body pit?

2705
03:57:01,120 --> 03:57:02,120
Where's the fucking body pit?

2706
03:57:02,120 --> 03:57:03,120
Where's the fucking body pit?

2707
03:57:03,120 --> 03:57:04,120
Where's the body pit?

2708
03:57:05,120 --> 03:57:06,120
Where's the body pit?

2709
03:57:06,120 --> 03:57:07,120
Where's the body pit?

2710
03:57:07,120 --> 03:57:08,120
Where's the body pit?

2711
03:57:08,120 --> 03:57:09,120
Where's the fucking body pit?

2712
03:57:09,120 --> 03:57:11,120
Can I please make a body pit?

2713
03:57:14,120 --> 03:57:15,120
Okay.

2714
03:57:15,120 --> 03:57:17,120
Just because I know we're going to get to centers,

2715
03:57:17,120 --> 03:57:19,120
I'm just going to do this.

2716
03:57:19,120 --> 03:57:21,120
Ooh, naughty followers.

2717
03:57:33,120 --> 03:57:34,120
Okay.

2718
03:57:38,120 --> 03:57:43,120
Um, I don't know where should I put the fucking graves?

2719
03:57:43,120 --> 03:57:45,120
I'll put them over here.

2720
03:57:47,120 --> 03:57:48,120
Wait, can I only make one?

2721
03:57:50,120 --> 03:57:51,120
Fucking hell.

2722
03:57:53,120 --> 03:57:54,120
God damn it.

2723
03:57:54,120 --> 03:57:56,120
Well, sorry guys.

2724
03:57:56,120 --> 03:57:58,120
Azura gets precedent.

2725
03:58:06,120 --> 03:58:07,120
Wait, where is it?

2726
03:58:07,120 --> 03:58:08,120
Where is it?

2727
03:58:08,120 --> 03:58:10,120
Oh, I need to build it.

2728
03:58:14,120 --> 03:58:16,120
I might want to revive Amy.

2729
03:58:24,120 --> 03:58:25,120
All right.

2730
03:58:25,120 --> 03:58:27,120
It's time for a little sermon.

2731
03:58:27,120 --> 03:58:31,120
Actually, wait, let me see if you guys give me any money.

2732
03:58:37,120 --> 03:58:39,120
You know, it's time to have...

2733
03:58:39,120 --> 03:58:42,120
Oh, yee, a little faith.

2734
03:58:42,120 --> 03:58:43,120
Anapathizo.

2735
03:58:43,120 --> 03:58:46,120
Well, I got us, you know, I got to support my sister.

2736
03:58:46,120 --> 03:58:48,120
She gets, yeah, she gets special stuff.

2737
03:58:48,120 --> 03:58:51,120
There's a lot less people than they were here before.

2738
03:58:58,120 --> 03:59:00,120
I don't know what to do with that.

2739
03:59:07,120 --> 03:59:09,120
I'm not making you drink Kool-Aid.

2740
03:59:09,120 --> 03:59:11,120
You're just starving to death.

2741
03:59:11,120 --> 03:59:16,120
You know, there are monks that would mummify themselves

2742
03:59:16,120 --> 03:59:19,120
from eating as little as possible and staying in the same spot

2743
03:59:19,120 --> 03:59:21,120
and just, you know, doing prayer.

2744
03:59:21,120 --> 03:59:24,120
And I think you guys should be doing the same.

2745
03:59:24,120 --> 03:59:26,120
Also, when do I get to intimidate you

2746
03:59:26,120 --> 03:59:28,120
to give me your fucking money?

2747
03:59:28,120 --> 03:59:31,120
Because I don't know what to do with it.

2748
03:59:31,120 --> 03:59:33,120
I don't know what to do with it.

2749
03:59:33,120 --> 03:59:35,120
I don't know what to do with it.

2750
03:59:35,120 --> 03:59:37,120
To intimidate you to give me your fucking money

2751
03:59:37,120 --> 03:59:39,120
because I need money.

2752
03:59:45,120 --> 03:59:47,120
How'd you?

2753
03:59:51,120 --> 03:59:53,120
How'd you rest until you're not sick?

2754
03:59:54,120 --> 03:59:56,120
I was sick, okay.

2755
03:59:56,120 --> 03:59:58,120
I still have enough money.

2756
03:59:58,120 --> 04:00:00,120
What's up?

2757
04:00:00,120 --> 04:00:02,120
What's up Buttercup?

2758
04:00:02,120 --> 04:00:04,120
Want me to build decorations?

2759
04:00:05,120 --> 04:00:07,120
Oh my god.

2760
04:00:07,120 --> 04:00:09,120
Why are you guys so...

2761
04:00:11,120 --> 04:00:13,120
I can make...

2762
04:00:18,120 --> 04:00:21,120
I'll make your bed area look real nice.

2763
04:00:22,120 --> 04:00:24,120
You know?

2764
04:00:24,120 --> 04:00:27,120
Well, this isn't going as I thought it would, but...

2765
04:00:27,120 --> 04:00:31,120
Look at this. I'm making your bed area so cute.

2766
04:00:31,120 --> 04:00:34,120
You get to sleep on rocks.

2767
04:00:35,120 --> 04:00:37,120
I want to get rid of that.

2768
04:00:38,120 --> 04:00:40,120
Hold on, I'm not done yet.

2769
04:00:43,120 --> 04:00:45,120
What the fuck was that noise?

2770
04:00:49,120 --> 04:00:51,120
This is so pretty.

2771
04:00:52,120 --> 04:00:54,120
Dones and flowers.

2772
04:00:55,120 --> 04:00:58,120
Okay, he's this little sick guy hanging out.

2773
04:00:58,120 --> 04:01:00,120
Dope.

2774
04:01:03,120 --> 04:01:06,120
Oh, ain't that dapper.

2775
04:01:06,120 --> 04:01:08,120
Look at that. That's so pretty.

2776
04:01:08,120 --> 04:01:10,120
Cool.

2777
04:01:12,120 --> 04:01:14,120
That didn't count as a decoration.

2778
04:01:14,120 --> 04:01:16,120
Okay, well, let's just put...

2779
04:01:16,120 --> 04:01:18,120
What are these, motherfuckers?

2780
04:01:20,120 --> 04:01:22,120
God, there's...

2781
04:01:22,120 --> 04:01:25,120
I need an outhouse and a little cleaning thingy ASAP.

2782
04:01:26,120 --> 04:01:29,120
Do we have to choose between food and sleeping indoors?

2783
04:01:29,120 --> 04:01:31,120
Yeah.

2784
04:01:31,120 --> 04:01:33,120
Wait, I can't build.

2785
04:01:34,120 --> 04:01:36,120
Can I kill you?

2786
04:01:37,120 --> 04:01:39,120
I can't kill you.

2787
04:01:40,120 --> 04:01:43,120
Sorry, I was going to kill you, God's will.

2788
04:01:50,120 --> 04:01:53,120
That gives a little log what you guys fucking think about.

2789
04:01:54,120 --> 04:01:57,120
Okay, which one of you wants to be food?

2790
04:01:57,120 --> 04:01:59,120
Why are you angry?

2791
04:02:08,120 --> 04:02:10,120
I gotta do all the work around here.

2792
04:02:12,120 --> 04:02:14,120
Oh my God, Fia, what are you doing?

2793
04:02:14,120 --> 04:02:18,120
Hi, can you jump instead of clawing my chair, lady?

2794
04:02:18,120 --> 04:02:22,120
Sometimes, because she couldn't use her legs for a long time.

2795
04:02:22,120 --> 04:02:24,120
I think she forgot how to jump.

2796
04:02:24,120 --> 04:02:26,120
So she kind of just pulls herself up on things.

2797
04:02:26,120 --> 04:02:28,120
Hi, new girl.

2798
04:02:28,120 --> 04:02:29,120
Hi.

2799
04:02:29,120 --> 04:02:31,120
You gotta jump up if you want to get up here.

2800
04:02:33,120 --> 04:02:35,120
Angerly waters.

2801
04:02:40,120 --> 04:02:43,120
Do you want me to pick you up because you seem like you're struggling, ma'am?

2802
04:02:46,120 --> 04:02:49,120
Or you can just sleep with Reina in the cat bed.

2803
04:02:52,120 --> 04:02:55,120
Iris is hardly good at farming.

2804
04:02:55,120 --> 04:02:57,120
Clean everything.

2805
04:02:57,120 --> 04:02:59,120
It's a pigsty in here.

2806
04:02:59,120 --> 04:03:03,120
You guys just be shitted and farted all over the place.

2807
04:03:03,120 --> 04:03:05,120
Why is it so dirty?

2808
04:03:21,120 --> 04:03:23,120
Why is it so dirty?

2809
04:03:23,120 --> 04:03:25,120
Sick.

2810
04:03:32,120 --> 04:03:34,120
Sick, nasty.

2811
04:03:44,120 --> 04:03:46,120
I think we're good.

2812
04:03:46,120 --> 04:03:48,120
Oh, maybe because of the fucking bodies or everywhere.

2813
04:03:48,120 --> 04:03:50,120
That's why it's so gross.

2814
04:03:50,120 --> 04:03:52,120
Is there a sick?

2815
04:03:52,120 --> 04:03:54,120
Oh, god.

2816
04:03:54,120 --> 04:03:56,120
All right.

2817
04:03:56,120 --> 04:03:58,120
Can I make some beds for you guys?

2818
04:04:00,120 --> 04:04:02,120
I can make one bed.

2819
04:04:03,120 --> 04:04:05,120
Hell yeah, brother.

2820
04:04:05,120 --> 04:04:10,120
One of you guys will get to wake up and fight over this little bed.

2821
04:04:16,120 --> 04:04:18,120
All right.

2822
04:04:21,120 --> 04:04:23,120
Collect?

2823
04:04:23,120 --> 04:04:25,120
Oh, I'll do that when he wakes up.

2824
04:04:28,120 --> 04:04:30,120
I just brought her back.

2825
04:04:35,120 --> 04:04:39,120
Finally, let's let us end this.

2826
04:04:40,120 --> 04:04:42,120
I'll be awaiting you in my temple.

2827
04:04:42,120 --> 04:04:45,120
Come witness your true power.

2828
04:04:50,120 --> 04:04:52,120
What the fuck are you doing?

2829
04:04:59,120 --> 04:05:01,120
You have to untouch yourself.

2830
04:05:03,120 --> 04:05:06,120
Ma'am, come here so I can pick you up.

2831
04:05:07,120 --> 04:05:09,120
There you go.

2832
04:05:09,120 --> 04:05:12,120
Now I have a snuggly baby.

2833
04:05:17,120 --> 04:05:19,120
How's the game going? It's going good.

2834
04:05:20,120 --> 04:05:22,120
I got a kitty cat on my lap.

2835
04:05:22,120 --> 04:05:24,120
She's purring up a storm.

2836
04:05:25,120 --> 04:05:28,120
She's sticking her butt in my face because she's weirdo.

2837
04:05:30,120 --> 04:05:33,120
Yeah, can I get some kitty purrs for the mic?

2838
04:05:34,120 --> 04:05:36,120
Can you get a little bit?

2839
04:05:37,120 --> 04:05:39,120
What are you doing?

2840
04:05:39,120 --> 04:05:41,120
Oh, you guys are missing out.

2841
04:05:41,120 --> 04:05:46,120
I can't wait for monetization because then you get the cat cam and you can see her cuteness.

2842
04:05:46,120 --> 04:05:49,120
Because she likes to roll on her back.

2843
04:05:49,120 --> 04:05:52,120
I'm going to show give me her tummy so I can rub her tummy.

2844
04:05:52,120 --> 04:05:55,120
She's a small little kitten girl.

2845
04:05:55,120 --> 04:05:58,120
She's a small little baby.

2846
04:05:59,120 --> 04:06:02,120
Let everybody hear your purrs for you.

2847
04:06:10,120 --> 04:06:12,120
I don't know if you can hear it.

2848
04:06:13,120 --> 04:06:16,120
Yeah, I don't think it's picking up.

2849
04:06:18,120 --> 04:06:23,120
She'd be staring at me when she just asked me if I'd be okay here.

2850
04:06:23,120 --> 04:06:25,120
Where are you going, Lee?

2851
04:06:25,120 --> 04:06:27,120
She's rubbing up her ass against the microphone.

2852
04:06:27,120 --> 04:06:29,120
Okay.

2853
04:06:33,120 --> 04:06:36,120
She got distracted. I think there's somebody walking by.

2854
04:06:36,120 --> 04:06:39,120
Are my landlord listening for extra cash?

2855
04:06:52,120 --> 04:06:55,120
Where are weapon damage, double the health when healing?

2856
04:07:00,120 --> 04:07:03,120
I can't, I think I have, I don't remember if I have a vampiric weapon.

2857
04:07:03,120 --> 04:07:05,120
Or not, I think it's just baneful.

2858
04:07:05,120 --> 04:07:07,120
So I'm going to go with this one.

2859
04:07:11,120 --> 04:07:13,120
Wait, was it vampiric dagger?

2860
04:07:13,120 --> 04:07:14,120
I think it was, fuck me.

2861
04:07:14,120 --> 04:07:17,120
Why do I have to have the worst memory imaginable?

2862
04:07:19,120 --> 04:07:21,120
Can I farm everything over here?

2863
04:07:21,120 --> 04:07:23,120
Okay.

2864
04:07:25,120 --> 04:07:28,120
The other deathbed companion.

2865
04:07:28,120 --> 04:07:30,120
What the hell?

2866
04:07:31,120 --> 04:07:33,120
What the hell?

2867
04:07:36,120 --> 04:07:38,120
Get poisoned, get poisoned.

2868
04:07:42,120 --> 04:07:45,120
I can't see what the fuck's happening.

2869
04:07:49,120 --> 04:07:51,120
Cool, alright.

2870
04:07:51,120 --> 04:07:53,120
The river just dried up real quick.

2871
04:07:55,120 --> 04:07:57,120
Can you hear that in the background?

2872
04:07:57,120 --> 04:07:59,120
That's Fia drinking water.

2873
04:07:59,120 --> 04:08:01,120
There's a fox on the water coming from her cat fountain.

2874
04:08:01,120 --> 04:08:02,120
I don't know why she does that.

2875
04:08:02,120 --> 04:08:04,120
She's done that ever since she was a little baby.

2876
04:08:08,120 --> 04:08:10,120
Nope, I like this. Why are there so many spikes?

2877
04:08:16,120 --> 04:08:18,120
Okay, this is easier for me.

2878
04:08:22,120 --> 04:08:25,120
Let's do a little farming, shall we?

2879
04:08:25,120 --> 04:08:27,120
What the fuck was that?

2880
04:08:29,120 --> 04:08:31,120
Am I tripping or did I just hear something?

2881
04:08:35,120 --> 04:08:37,120
What was that?

2882
04:08:37,120 --> 04:08:42,120
I just heard something that sounded like it was coming backwards.

2883
04:08:42,120 --> 04:08:44,120
Am I losing my mind?

2884
04:08:47,120 --> 04:08:49,120
Your dono sound?

2885
04:08:49,120 --> 04:08:51,120
That shouldn't come out backwards.

2886
04:08:51,120 --> 04:08:53,120
The Texas species doesn't sound like that.

2887
04:08:53,120 --> 04:08:55,120
Hold on.

2888
04:08:55,120 --> 04:08:57,120
Someone tipped?

2889
04:08:59,120 --> 04:09:01,120
Did you scare me?

2890
04:09:01,120 --> 04:09:05,120
Please, let's stop letting us starve, you cruel, cruel mistress.

2891
04:09:06,120 --> 04:09:09,120
That sounded so weird, the Texas species just gets garbled.

2892
04:09:09,120 --> 04:09:12,120
Thank you for the tip, Anonymous. You're the best.

2893
04:09:17,120 --> 04:09:22,120
Yeah, I think the game sound overcame it.

2894
04:09:30,120 --> 04:09:32,120
Was Arizona longer ill?

2895
04:09:32,120 --> 04:09:34,120
I forgot the name for Donovan and Sheba.

2896
04:09:34,120 --> 04:09:36,120
Yeah, I knew. What were you talking about?

2897
04:09:36,120 --> 04:09:38,120
Thanks, Anonymous. That's what their name was.

2898
04:09:38,120 --> 04:09:40,120
I don't know what to tell you.

2899
04:09:42,120 --> 04:09:45,120
Don't tell me how to do my job.

2900
04:09:48,120 --> 04:09:50,120
Thank you, Anon.

2901
04:09:50,120 --> 04:09:52,120
Anon? I would say Anon.

2902
04:09:54,120 --> 04:09:57,120
Souls of the Damned. I'm haunted by your donation alert.

2903
04:10:00,120 --> 04:10:12,120
Sorry, I just looked at my text and my friend texted our group chat.

2904
04:10:12,120 --> 04:10:16,120
We have a group chat, me and my friend.

2905
04:10:16,120 --> 04:10:19,120
I already talked about her before and I gave her the code name Salem.

2906
04:10:19,120 --> 04:10:24,120
Any other girl? I'll call her Olive.

2907
04:10:24,120 --> 04:10:29,120
Olive, because she's Greek.

2908
04:10:29,120 --> 04:10:34,120
So Olive and Salem, Olive just texted.

2909
04:10:34,120 --> 04:10:40,120
Guys, we're all hot. We should get pregnant and procreate.

2910
04:10:40,120 --> 04:10:42,120
So spread our genes.

2911
04:10:42,120 --> 04:10:45,120
Just like what?

2912
04:10:45,120 --> 04:10:49,120
I don't know the context of the conversation.

2913
04:10:49,120 --> 04:10:53,120
I haven't been looking at the group chat that we have together.

2914
04:10:53,120 --> 04:10:58,120
I was just out of context.

2915
04:10:58,120 --> 04:11:01,120
I was glanced and saw it pop up.

2916
04:11:01,120 --> 04:11:05,120
We're all hot. We should all get pregnant.

2917
04:11:11,120 --> 04:11:14,120
Olive Gardening kind of based for that.

2918
04:11:18,120 --> 04:11:20,120
My God.

2919
04:11:24,120 --> 04:11:29,120
It's because we're all around the baby fever age.

2920
04:11:32,120 --> 04:11:37,120
One of them was married, one of them was engaged.

2921
04:11:37,120 --> 04:11:42,120
They got them hormones.

2922
04:11:42,120 --> 04:11:45,120
Me, I'm sitting here with my three cats and I'm doing okay.

2923
04:11:48,120 --> 04:11:52,120
Kids are way too fucking expensive.

2924
04:11:52,120 --> 04:11:55,120
That's why I run Wonderland instead.

2925
04:11:55,120 --> 04:11:58,120
I'm a business woman. I'm a career woman.

2926
04:11:58,120 --> 04:12:02,120
Oh, I forgot I have a disease heart.

2927
04:12:02,120 --> 04:12:04,120
I'm not a...

2928
04:12:04,120 --> 04:12:07,120
I'd be a great mom. I'd be a great fucking mom.

2929
04:12:07,120 --> 04:12:10,120
Sleeping bag has collapsed.

2930
04:12:10,120 --> 04:12:13,120
At least they're no longer ill.

2931
04:12:13,120 --> 04:12:16,120
Because I cook.

2932
04:12:16,120 --> 04:12:19,120
I stay mostly clean.

2933
04:12:19,120 --> 04:12:22,120
I'll support the child emotionally.

2934
04:12:22,120 --> 04:12:25,120
I have a job.

2935
04:12:25,120 --> 04:12:28,120
I'm pretty.

2936
04:12:28,120 --> 04:12:31,120
I'm cultured.

2937
04:12:31,120 --> 04:12:35,120
The child would be brought up well.

2938
04:12:35,120 --> 04:12:38,120
I don't have a job.

2939
04:12:38,120 --> 04:12:42,120
I'm cultured. The child would be brought up well.

2940
04:12:45,120 --> 04:12:47,120
So yeah, I'd be the perfect mother.

2941
04:12:47,120 --> 04:12:50,120
That's all you need, right?

2942
04:12:54,120 --> 04:12:57,120
Childs in this economy, not children.

2943
04:12:57,120 --> 04:12:59,120
Childs.

2944
04:12:59,120 --> 04:13:01,120
I guess you're all adopted. You're all my children.

2945
04:13:01,120 --> 04:13:04,120
The dying star will light again.

2946
04:13:04,120 --> 04:13:06,120
Inflation is hitting harder.

2947
04:13:07,120 --> 04:13:10,120
I did leave the tweets, though, because I didn't want people to freak out.

2948
04:13:10,120 --> 04:13:16,120
But I was saying that my landlord wants to raise my rent to 2,300.

2949
04:13:20,120 --> 04:13:22,120
No! Thank you.

2950
04:13:24,120 --> 04:13:26,120
Oh, wait.

2951
04:13:28,120 --> 04:13:31,120
And I'm just like, kill me.

2952
04:13:33,120 --> 04:13:35,120
Let's see.

2953
04:13:35,120 --> 04:13:37,120
I can't.

2954
04:13:38,120 --> 04:13:41,120
What the fuck is that? I get a tarot card? I don't really care about that.

2955
04:13:41,120 --> 04:13:44,120
I'm going to prioritize materials.

2956
04:13:44,120 --> 04:13:48,120
Living in Darnia? No, cost of living where I am is just really expensive.

2957
04:13:50,120 --> 04:13:53,120
For one bedroom.

2958
04:13:53,120 --> 04:13:56,120
In some places, it's 1900 for a studio.

2959
04:13:56,120 --> 04:13:59,120
Isn't that fucking whack?

2960
04:14:00,120 --> 04:14:03,120
I hate America.

2961
04:14:03,120 --> 04:14:06,120
Although, I wonder if it's easier.

2962
04:14:16,120 --> 04:14:19,120
It's move? Yeah, it's so easy to move.

2963
04:14:19,120 --> 04:14:23,120
My whole family is up here. Actually, some of my family is south.

2964
04:14:26,120 --> 04:14:30,120
I'm also someone who fucking hates change.

2965
04:14:30,120 --> 04:14:38,120
And my friends and my family up here, so I would be very terrified to move to some place that has a lower cost of living.

2966
04:14:38,120 --> 04:14:42,120
Especially because you guys know I tend to isolate myself.

2967
04:14:43,120 --> 04:14:46,120
Yeah, like moving is cheaper.

2968
04:14:46,120 --> 04:14:54,120
Right now, I do pay 1500, but because of all the stuff with my cats, they're just like, well, 2,300.

2969
04:14:55,120 --> 04:14:58,120
Actually, let me check my email.

2970
04:15:03,120 --> 04:15:06,120
She literally, you know how petty she fucking is?

2971
04:15:06,120 --> 04:15:13,120
She sends the email about possibly evicting me for that.

2972
04:15:13,120 --> 04:15:18,120
And then, and it was 10 minutes before the office closed.

2973
04:15:18,120 --> 04:15:21,120
So when I sent my response, she didn't have the response.

2974
04:15:21,120 --> 04:15:25,120
The office was open today, but I don't think she was in.

2975
04:15:25,120 --> 04:15:28,120
And so she's just like letting me sit.

2976
04:15:28,120 --> 04:15:31,120
Like what sort of fucking maniacal being are you?

2977
04:15:31,120 --> 04:15:35,120
To email someone, oh, you're gonna get evicted if this is a change.

2978
04:15:35,120 --> 04:15:38,120
And then let them stew over that over the weekend.

2979
04:15:38,120 --> 04:15:41,120
Like how fucked is that?

2980
04:15:41,120 --> 04:15:46,120
I'm just like, I hate these landlords. Our last ones were so much fucking nicer.

2981
04:15:47,120 --> 04:15:50,120
And it's like, oh my God.

2982
04:15:54,120 --> 04:16:02,120
And like, and I'm not like, oh, because like, yes, it was a lease violation having more than two pets, whatever.

2983
04:16:02,120 --> 04:16:07,120
But they send the most passive aggressive on professional emails.

2984
04:16:07,120 --> 04:16:09,120
Like, so we have like a pool at our place, right?

2985
04:16:09,120 --> 04:16:12,120
There's like a pool.

2986
04:16:13,120 --> 04:16:18,120
And before you could like rent out the space to have host like gatherings and whatever.

2987
04:16:18,120 --> 04:16:19,120
So they got rid of that.

2988
04:16:19,120 --> 04:16:24,120
Now you have to have like a sort of like ticket thing to go to the pool.

2989
04:16:24,120 --> 04:16:26,120
You can only bring one other person with you.

2990
04:16:26,120 --> 04:16:34,120
So if I wanted to have like my friends with me or my parents come over and just like hang by the pool,

2991
04:16:34,120 --> 04:16:36,120
I would only be able to take like my mom or my dad.

2992
04:16:36,120 --> 04:16:37,120
Just dumb.

2993
04:16:38,120 --> 04:16:43,120
And if I violate that more than like three times, they'll evict me.

2994
04:16:43,120 --> 04:16:44,120
Oh no.

2995
04:16:44,120 --> 04:16:47,120
So they'll take away my pool privileges and then they'll evict me.

2996
04:16:49,120 --> 04:16:52,120
And then what else?

2997
04:16:56,120 --> 04:17:02,120
Oh yeah, they just, they would were towing people that had the right stickers.

2998
04:17:03,120 --> 04:17:10,120
And then when people were like, hey, I was towed by the towing company when I had the right information on my car.

2999
04:17:10,120 --> 04:17:12,120
They were like, sorry, it's on the towing company.

3000
04:17:12,120 --> 04:17:13,120
It's not on us.

3001
04:17:13,120 --> 04:17:18,120
And so you'd have to, I remember my neighbor, my sweet little old man neighbor I have.

3002
04:17:18,120 --> 04:17:20,120
What the fuck do you want?

3003
04:17:21,120 --> 04:17:25,120
Got towed and he had to pay $300 to get his car back.

3004
04:17:27,120 --> 04:17:29,120
You may think yourself clever.

3005
04:17:29,120 --> 04:17:31,120
You may think yourself righteous and your service to him.

3006
04:17:31,120 --> 04:17:34,120
But you cannot be so trusting of the chained one.

3007
04:17:34,120 --> 04:17:36,120
Oh well, it's too late for talk.

3008
04:17:36,120 --> 04:17:39,120
One such as you deserves no absolution.

3009
04:17:39,120 --> 04:17:41,120
This will not end well for you.

3010
04:17:42,120 --> 04:17:44,120
I remember staring again.

3011
04:17:45,120 --> 04:17:47,120
I'm just trying to farm shit.

3012
04:17:48,120 --> 04:17:50,120
Oh, I'm feeling.

3013
04:18:02,120 --> 04:18:04,120
And yeah, I feel bad for older people that lived in the building.

3014
04:18:04,120 --> 04:18:12,120
I saw like there was this really sweet disabled old woman that lived on the first floor and she moved out because I think they raised her rent on her.

3015
04:18:12,120 --> 04:18:14,120
She was like this little cute old woman with a walker.

3016
04:18:14,120 --> 04:18:16,120
I helped her bring in her groceries once.

3017
04:18:16,120 --> 04:18:22,120
And I haven't seen her since and I'm worried that she had to move or was evicted for whatever fucking reason.

3018
04:18:22,120 --> 04:18:24,120
Like it's just all they want is money.

3019
04:18:24,120 --> 04:18:29,120
Like when I was first moved in here, everything was so much cheaper and they raised the rent.

3020
04:18:29,120 --> 04:18:33,120
Like a two bedrooms like almost 3K.

3021
04:18:42,120 --> 04:18:43,120
Bricks.

3022
04:18:43,120 --> 04:18:45,120
I'm about to get bricked up.

3023
04:18:49,120 --> 04:18:50,120
They're still there at the first.

3024
04:18:50,120 --> 04:18:51,120
Oh yeah.

3025
04:18:51,120 --> 04:18:58,120
And I know like you know how like places will like you'll be like you give the deposit and then they just kind of like say something.

3026
04:18:59,120 --> 04:19:05,120
Stupid and then they won't get like so my building is like fairly new.

3027
04:19:05,120 --> 04:19:10,120
I get like leaks in my windows and so the seal isn't good.

3028
04:19:10,120 --> 04:19:17,120
And so I have like brown all under my windows because of the stain from the water and the paint peels off.

3029
04:19:17,120 --> 04:19:20,120
And I'm like, I hate it here.

3030
04:19:23,120 --> 04:19:25,120
Rent control should be the norm 100%.

3031
04:19:26,120 --> 04:19:29,120
Yeah, I know New York has rent control.

3032
04:19:29,120 --> 04:19:31,120
I think, right?

3033
04:19:37,120 --> 04:19:40,120
Sometimes you can tell with like little stars and stuff.

3034
04:19:42,120 --> 04:19:43,120
What?

3035
04:19:43,120 --> 04:19:45,120
Oh hey, it's that guy.

3036
04:19:48,120 --> 04:19:51,120
Hey kiddo, keep your eyes off my fishies.

3037
04:19:51,120 --> 04:19:53,120
Alright, enough with the both of us.

3038
04:19:53,120 --> 04:19:55,120
The best fishing can be found at Pilgrim's Passage.

3039
04:19:55,120 --> 04:19:57,120
Where's that you say?

3040
04:19:57,120 --> 04:19:59,120
Let me show ya kid.

3041
04:20:00,120 --> 04:20:03,120
For real, I mentioned one streamer having a donathon chat on past the goals.

3042
04:20:03,120 --> 04:20:06,120
They were like, use the rest of money to move out.

3043
04:20:06,120 --> 04:20:11,120
Yeah, that would, I'm not going to lie.

3044
04:20:11,120 --> 04:20:15,120
When I do my birthday donathon.

3045
04:20:16,120 --> 04:20:24,120
I'm torn between using it to like my cut to do 3D or move out.

3046
04:20:24,120 --> 04:20:30,120
Cause like I know if I move out and get a little spot, like that'll be best.

3047
04:20:30,120 --> 04:20:33,120
Cause then I can just literally do whatever the fuck I want.

3048
04:20:33,120 --> 04:20:35,120
Wish I could fish.

3049
04:20:37,120 --> 04:20:38,120
Move out 100%.

3050
04:20:38,120 --> 04:20:43,120
And it's like cause like I thought like everything would be fine when I moved out of my parents house.

3051
04:20:43,120 --> 04:20:45,120
But like there's always something.

3052
04:20:45,120 --> 04:20:48,120
Like an apartment, landlord is always something.

3053
04:20:49,120 --> 04:20:51,120
I feel bad for my parents too.

3054
04:20:52,120 --> 04:20:55,120
Cause I know they want to buy a house.

3055
04:20:55,120 --> 04:21:00,120
But my mom got screwed on something.

3056
04:21:00,120 --> 04:21:03,120
Some person from her job screwed up her taxes.

3057
04:21:03,120 --> 04:21:06,120
And so she has to pay like so much taxes and interest back.

3058
04:21:07,120 --> 04:21:10,120
Because of one little temps mistake.

3059
04:21:10,120 --> 04:21:11,120
What are you doing?

3060
04:21:11,120 --> 04:21:12,120
Are you trying to get a bug?

3061
04:21:12,120 --> 04:21:13,120
Cause you're freaking me out.

3062
04:21:13,120 --> 04:21:14,120
You're going to fall.

3063
04:21:16,120 --> 04:21:18,120
Sorry, I don't mean to complain.

3064
04:21:19,120 --> 04:21:21,120
Just telling you what it is.

3065
04:21:23,120 --> 04:21:25,120
Telling you what's on my mind.

3066
04:21:26,120 --> 04:21:28,120
Just so you, sorry, I'm destroying your entire camp.

3067
04:21:28,120 --> 04:21:29,120
I hope you don't mind.

3068
04:21:29,120 --> 04:21:32,120
I'm just hungry and I need to feed my people.

3069
04:21:35,120 --> 04:21:39,120
Just like how there's like still fire coming from the ground when the fire is gone.

3070
04:21:40,120 --> 04:21:41,120
Haha.

3071
04:22:03,120 --> 04:22:04,120
He's spitting bars.

3072
04:22:06,120 --> 04:22:09,120
Yeah, and like I'm not, don't, oh my god, but we just fell.

3073
04:22:10,120 --> 04:22:12,120
I told you, I warned you dude.

3074
04:22:13,120 --> 04:22:15,120
But I know like the other girls have it more difficult me.

3075
04:22:15,120 --> 04:22:16,120
Cause like I live in my apartment.

3076
04:22:16,120 --> 04:22:17,120
I live alone.

3077
04:22:17,120 --> 04:22:18,120
It's great.

3078
04:22:19,120 --> 04:22:21,120
I know like some other girls with their family.

3079
04:22:21,120 --> 04:22:24,120
So, or like live in an area where it's really noisy.

3080
04:22:27,120 --> 04:22:31,120
So I'm thankful for what I have and for how much I have to pay.

3081
04:22:33,120 --> 04:22:34,120
For now.

3082
04:22:35,120 --> 04:22:39,120
Like trust me, I'm very, very much full of gratitude.

3083
04:22:40,120 --> 04:22:41,120
For what I do have.

3084
04:22:50,120 --> 04:22:52,120
Sometimes you just need a vent.

3085
04:22:52,120 --> 04:22:55,120
And I normally I would use my, I'm already full.

3086
04:23:00,120 --> 04:23:08,120
I would use my alt, but I'm scared to vent into the boy that is 17k people.

3087
04:23:10,120 --> 04:23:11,120
Haha.

3088
04:23:16,120 --> 04:23:17,120
That's cool.

3089
04:23:17,120 --> 04:23:18,120
That's great.

3090
04:23:18,120 --> 04:23:21,120
I'm trying to, do you have anything here that I can steal or break?

3091
04:23:21,120 --> 04:23:22,120
No?

3092
04:23:22,120 --> 04:23:23,120
All right.

3093
04:23:25,120 --> 04:23:26,120
It's fine while I'm here.

3094
04:23:26,120 --> 04:23:27,120
We appreciate it.

3095
04:23:27,120 --> 04:23:30,120
Talking about stuff is like, like this.

3096
04:23:30,120 --> 04:23:35,120
I actually, to be more to say like, I think so.

3097
04:23:35,120 --> 04:23:39,120
The listening, understanding, like bro, mounting, and you, and then we're just singing, right?

3098
04:23:39,120 --> 04:23:42,120
It's a great time to be in the line of the place.

3099
04:23:44,120 --> 04:23:46,120
Also, in the creature's life.

3100
04:23:50,120 --> 04:23:51,120
Yeah, 100%.

3101
04:23:51,120 --> 04:23:57,120
If you have the ability to save, definitely save for a house.

3102
04:23:57,120 --> 04:24:00,120
Although it's really hardly even the housing market's trash right now.

3103
04:24:03,120 --> 04:24:04,120
Wait, what?

3104
04:24:05,120 --> 04:24:07,120
She really just went in the complete wrong direction.

3105
04:24:10,120 --> 04:24:12,120
Am I fucking stupid?

3106
04:24:12,120 --> 04:24:13,120
Oh yeah, I am.

3107
04:24:17,120 --> 04:24:20,120
Save, always save as much as you can.

3108
04:24:20,120 --> 04:24:23,120
Like save first and last and also like an extra month.

3109
04:24:24,120 --> 04:24:25,120
Like save first last.

3110
04:24:26,120 --> 04:24:28,120
If you can save first and last twice, you're golden.

3111
04:24:29,120 --> 04:24:35,120
And it sucks because like they say like, oh, your rent should be like 30% of your income.

3112
04:24:35,120 --> 04:24:36,120
Like that's not the case.

3113
04:24:36,120 --> 04:24:38,120
Like my rent's like majority of my income.

3114
04:24:39,120 --> 04:24:42,120
Then the rest of it goes to the cats and then I sometimes get food.

3115
04:24:45,120 --> 04:24:46,120
It's savings hard too.

3116
04:24:46,120 --> 04:24:48,120
Like I also have like a lot of school debt I have to go through.

3117
04:24:51,120 --> 04:25:05,120
I gotta pay off my credit card because I spent $8,000 trying to save Fia's life with her shit that she had going on where she couldn't move.

3118
04:25:07,120 --> 04:25:13,120
For a month and a half and that was some of you guys know from back when I was a priestess how fucking harrowing that was.

3119
04:25:15,120 --> 04:25:17,120
She's here, she's fine, she's alive.

3120
04:25:21,120 --> 04:25:22,120
That's all I cared about.

3121
04:25:23,120 --> 04:25:25,120
Come here you fucking squirrel!

3122
04:25:32,120 --> 04:25:34,120
I always put my babies first.

3123
04:25:37,120 --> 04:25:38,120
It's a one-bed appointment.

3124
04:25:39,120 --> 04:25:40,120
Appointment? Yeah.

3125
04:25:43,120 --> 04:25:46,120
Some people will pay about $1.50 right now.

3126
04:25:46,120 --> 04:25:47,120
I think it's more than that.

3127
04:25:49,120 --> 04:25:50,120
$50, $60, $100.

3128
04:25:53,120 --> 04:25:54,120
Yeah, she's much better.

3129
04:25:55,120 --> 04:25:56,120
She's much better now.

3130
04:25:58,120 --> 04:25:59,120
Guys close the whole video game on the same?

3131
04:25:59,120 --> 04:26:00,120
Aw, rip.

3132
04:26:00,120 --> 04:26:01,120
I'm sorry bro.

3133
04:26:01,120 --> 04:26:08,120
But like despite all the stuff that I've been like dealing with, I'm just so fucking thankful I'm here with you guys.

3134
04:26:09,120 --> 04:26:11,120
Like I'm so fucking thankful I'm a realer.

3135
04:26:13,120 --> 04:26:17,120
Cause all I wanted, like one of my goals was just to be in there and see all I wanted to do.

3136
04:26:17,120 --> 04:26:19,120
I just wanted to hang out with cool people.

3137
04:26:19,120 --> 04:26:22,120
And the fact that it was my dream agency that I really wanted to be in, makes it a-

3138
04:26:22,120 --> 04:26:23,120
I'm sorry bro.

3139
04:26:25,120 --> 04:26:27,120
But like despite all the stuff that I've been like dealing with.

3140
04:26:27,120 --> 04:26:32,120
The fact that it was my dream agency that I really wanted to be in, makes it all a more sweeter.

3141
04:26:35,120 --> 04:26:37,120
Cause Strani's old fanbase, I'm like I want that.

3142
04:26:37,120 --> 04:26:41,120
I want just like like-mighted people like that.

3143
04:26:41,120 --> 04:26:42,120
And I have it.

3144
04:26:42,120 --> 04:26:43,120
It's great.

3145
04:26:46,120 --> 04:26:47,120
You don't have a fucking fucking bit.

3146
04:26:50,120 --> 04:26:51,120
Oh hi Reina.

3147
04:26:51,120 --> 04:26:52,120
Are you gonna-

3148
04:26:52,120 --> 04:26:53,120
Oh man.

3149
04:26:53,120 --> 04:26:54,120
Oh, you almost fell.

3150
04:26:54,120 --> 04:26:57,120
Ow, your claws are fucking digging into me.

3151
04:26:58,120 --> 04:26:59,120
Okay, I'll give you a little hug.

3152
04:27:03,120 --> 04:27:05,120
Yeah, hearts, hearts, hearts, hearts.

3153
04:27:06,120 --> 04:27:07,120
Why am I so small?

3154
04:27:08,120 --> 04:27:09,120
That's fine.

3155
04:27:12,120 --> 04:27:15,120
I appreciate, I'm happy you guys stuck around since debuts and stuff.

3156
04:27:16,120 --> 04:27:20,120
I genuinely thought people wouldn't like me.

3157
04:27:21,120 --> 04:27:24,120
The brainworms got to me for a little bit.

3158
04:27:40,120 --> 04:27:43,120
But it seems like everybody enjoys all the girls, which makes me just happy.

3159
04:27:44,120 --> 04:27:46,120
Yeah, I just- I just- I'm a-

3160
04:27:46,120 --> 04:27:47,120
I'm a-

3161
04:27:48,120 --> 04:27:49,120
Not to be-

3162
04:27:49,120 --> 04:27:55,120
Not to be emo or anything, but I'm a very lowly person and streaming is like the closest thing I get to like speaking my truth.

3163
04:27:56,120 --> 04:27:57,120
Hanging out with people.

3164
04:27:57,120 --> 04:27:58,120
Cause sometimes-

3165
04:27:59,120 --> 04:28:00,120
Like when you-

3166
04:28:04,120 --> 04:28:07,120
Are like from the internet and stuff,

3167
04:28:07,120 --> 04:28:08,120
I feel like I can't-

3168
04:28:08,120 --> 04:28:11,120
Like I'm not my friends like VTubers, not my friends like-

3169
04:28:11,120 --> 04:28:13,120
I have a couple of friends like anime.

3170
04:28:14,120 --> 04:28:15,120
Like-

3171
04:28:16,120 --> 04:28:18,120
It's nice or like streaming or anything.

3172
04:28:19,120 --> 04:28:22,120
I only have like one other streamer friend and I think she even quit.

3173
04:28:25,120 --> 04:28:27,120
Funny you generally like about to. Thank you.

3174
04:28:28,120 --> 04:28:30,120
You alert to each other on my timeline on other passages.

3175
04:28:30,120 --> 04:28:32,120
No, check out everyone streaming down here.

3176
04:28:32,120 --> 04:28:33,120
Autonic love.

3177
04:28:35,120 --> 04:28:37,120
No, send me your true love.

3178
04:28:40,120 --> 04:28:41,120
Oh, I'm feeling me.

3179
04:28:41,120 --> 04:28:42,120
Disgraceful.

3180
04:28:44,120 --> 04:28:46,120
I have to make some grasp rule.

3181
04:28:49,120 --> 04:28:56,120
Yeah, I'm just really glad I'm here and that it's been my dream since I was a little girl to be a content creator.

3182
04:28:57,120 --> 04:29:01,120
Now I get to, you know, pour myself out on the internet, but in a better way as an anime girl.

3183
04:29:04,120 --> 04:29:06,120
I grow tired of you little lamb.

3184
04:29:07,120 --> 04:29:10,120
Time to put an end to this frivolous masquerade!

3185
04:29:13,120 --> 04:29:15,120
I'm on my own. I'm on my own.

3186
04:29:21,120 --> 04:29:22,120
Yeah, they all killed themselves.

3187
04:29:25,120 --> 04:29:26,120
Thank you, thank you.

3188
04:29:27,120 --> 04:29:31,120
I'm a terrible cult leader, but I'm a person.

3189
04:29:31,120 --> 04:29:32,120
It's funny as hell.

3190
04:29:32,120 --> 04:29:33,120
Oh.

3191
04:29:42,120 --> 04:29:44,120
Actually, I don't really care about the little guys too much, unless they get in the way.

3192
04:29:44,120 --> 04:29:45,120
I don't know why.

3193
04:30:02,120 --> 04:30:03,120
Sometimes I forget where I am.

3194
04:30:03,120 --> 04:30:16,120
Usually I kill all the little guys and then I leave one alive, but I accidentally just fucking killed one.

3195
04:30:19,120 --> 04:30:21,120
So then he doesn't spawn them again.

3196
04:30:34,120 --> 04:30:39,120
I wish that would have effected them.

3197
04:30:48,120 --> 04:30:49,120
Okay, I'll leave that guy alive.

3198
04:30:58,120 --> 04:31:00,120
Oh, damn it, he spawned more.

3199
04:31:03,120 --> 04:31:04,120
Fuck.

3200
04:31:13,120 --> 04:31:14,120
What?

3201
04:31:16,120 --> 04:31:18,120
I was not paying attention to my health.

3202
04:31:23,120 --> 04:31:24,120
What the fuck?

3203
04:31:26,120 --> 04:31:27,120
Did you guys kill me?

3204
04:31:34,120 --> 04:31:36,120
Oh yeah, someone in chat killed me.

3205
04:31:39,120 --> 04:31:41,120
Well, whoever did that, fuck you.

3206
04:31:49,120 --> 04:31:50,120
Totally wasn't deserved.

3207
04:32:04,120 --> 04:32:07,120
Thank you, starving cultist, for tipping.

3208
04:32:10,120 --> 04:32:12,120
My fellow cultist is time to rebel.

3209
04:32:12,120 --> 04:32:16,120
We have nothing to lose, but this is the show on our accurate valve for food.

3210
04:32:17,120 --> 04:32:18,120
Oh, that's funny as fuck.

3211
04:32:21,120 --> 04:32:22,120
Follow me?

3212
04:32:22,120 --> 04:32:24,120
Let's see what's going on for the fun.

3213
04:32:27,120 --> 04:32:28,120
Sometimes it, but...

3214
04:32:29,120 --> 04:32:31,120
That's how speak works.

3215
04:32:34,120 --> 04:32:35,120
Drag's still on?

3216
04:32:35,120 --> 04:32:36,120
Yeah, I might turn that one off.

3217
04:32:38,120 --> 04:32:40,120
The randomly just kill me one.

3218
04:32:40,120 --> 04:32:42,120
I didn't know that was a, that was a thing.

3219
04:32:45,120 --> 04:32:47,120
Cause I know someone will just trigger that again.

3220
04:32:59,120 --> 04:33:02,120
Why does Strony's Texas speech work so well?

3221
04:33:03,120 --> 04:33:04,120
Mine doesn't at all.

3222
04:33:08,120 --> 04:33:10,120
I think some of the settings override each other.

3223
04:33:28,120 --> 04:33:29,120
Traitor among us.

3224
04:33:30,120 --> 04:33:32,120
Hope I won't resurrect any of the followers now.

3225
04:33:32,120 --> 04:33:34,120
That's just how it's gonna be.

3226
04:33:34,120 --> 04:33:37,120
Do you think we're getting pretty mad at the whole cultist uprising thing?

3227
04:33:37,120 --> 04:33:38,120
This might get dicey.

3228
04:33:40,120 --> 04:33:41,120
He doesn't know where to get.

3229
04:33:41,120 --> 04:33:42,120
No.

3230
04:33:47,120 --> 04:33:48,120
I think...

3231
04:33:49,120 --> 04:33:51,120
I think there's something that's overriding everything.

3232
04:33:52,120 --> 04:33:55,120
It was like when you did one of them at works.

3233
04:33:57,120 --> 04:33:59,120
And I made it so that...

3234
04:34:04,120 --> 04:34:05,120
I made it so that...

3235
04:34:07,120 --> 04:34:08,120
I made it so that...

3236
04:34:09,120 --> 04:34:10,120
I made it so that...

3237
04:34:11,120 --> 04:34:12,120
I made it so that...

3238
04:34:13,120 --> 04:34:14,120
I made it so that...

3239
04:34:15,120 --> 04:34:16,120
I made it so that...

3240
04:34:16,120 --> 04:34:18,120
I made it so that...

3241
04:34:26,120 --> 04:34:28,120
Creations are always like that!

3242
04:34:38,120 --> 04:34:39,120
Okay, you're gonna see me, like...

3243

05:02:52,480 --> 05:02:54,480
and I just got your loyalty up

3612
05:02:59,480 --> 05:03:01,480
I know I can feed them the bodies of followers

3613
05:03:03,480 --> 05:03:05,480

05:03:07,480 --> 05:03:09,480
Jesus Christ

3616
05:03:19,480 --> 05:03:21,480
Why are people so needy?

3617
05:03:21,480 --> 05:03:23,480
This is why I'll never have children

3618
05:03:23,480 --> 05:03:25,480
Because they're just gonna whine and complain that I don't feed them

3619
05:03:27,480 --> 05:03:30,480
Because I spent all my money on video games

3620
05:03:35,480 --> 05:03:37,480
Hello lamb, oh hey what's up

3621
05:03:37,480 --> 05:03:39,480

05:03:41,480 --> 05:03:43,480
I had crowd control on

3624
05:03:43,480 --> 05:03:46,480
And they all became followers and I don't have enough resources

3625
05:03:47,480 --> 05:03:49,480
To feed all these fucking people

3626
05:03:49,480 --> 05:03:51,480

3627
05:03:55,480 --> 05:03:57,480

Fuck off

3630
05:04:16,480 --> 05:04:18,480

05:07:06,480 --> 05:07:08,480
Can't build anything cause I don't have enough money

3675
05:07:10,480 --> 05:07:12,480
Some grass on the ground

3676
05:07:12,480 --> 05:07:14,480
Gonna make more food

3677
05:07:18,480 --> 05:07:20,480
I work day and night

3678
05:07:20,480 --> 05:07:22,480
I'm just gonna bring help down

3679
05:07:22,480 --> 05:07:24,480
They're fine they're fine

3680
05:07:26,480 --> 05:07:28,480

05:07:28,480 --> 05:07:30,480
You guys pooped in a clean little row for me

3682
05:07:30,480 --> 05:07:32,480
Appreciate it

3683
05:07:40,480 --> 05:07:41,480
I can't

3684
05:07:43,480 --> 05:07:45,480
I think because two people are sick it's one of the things

3685
05:07:45,480 --> 05:07:46,480
No

3686
05:07:47,480 --> 05:07:48,480

3687
05:07:49,480 --> 05:07:50,480

3688
05:07:51,480 --> 05:07:53,480

3689
05:07:56,480 --> 05:07:58,480
Now you bitches can't kill me

3690
05:08:00,480 --> 05:08:02,480
As I'm about to beat the boss

3691
05:08:02,480 --> 05:08:04,480
Like they waited

3692
05:08:04,480 --> 05:08:06,480
They waited

3693
05:08:08,480 --> 05:08:10,480
Until they were almost close to health

3694
05:08:10,480 --> 05:08:13,480
I almost had full health and they waited until I

3695
05:08:14,480 --> 05:08:16,480
Oh what a cunt

3696
05:08:20,480 --> 05:08:22,480
Honestly I'm not that bad it was kind of funny

3697
05:08:26,480 --> 05:08:28,480
I think that's why I subconsciously left it there

3698
05:08:29,480 --> 05:08:31,480
Is there someone to fuck me

3699
05:08:37,480 --> 05:08:39,480
Skill issue yeah skill issue

3700
05:08:41,480 --> 05:08:44,480
Skill issue when I get killed out of my control

3701
05:08:57,480 --> 05:08:59,480
Some grass

3702
05:08:59,480 --> 05:09:01,480
Some grass

3703
05:09:09,480 --> 05:09:11,480
50 50 that's it

3704
05:09:11,480 --> 05:09:13,480
I can't read

3705
05:09:14,480 --> 05:09:16,480
Although if I didn't walk forward it probably wouldn't

3706
05:09:30,480 --> 05:09:32,480
I thought I missed on this game

3707
05:09:34,480 --> 05:09:36,480
So hungry I'm dreaming of chewing madams

3708
05:09:36,480 --> 05:09:38,480
Please don't eat my hair

3709
05:09:38,480 --> 05:09:39,480
What do you eat my hair?

3710
05:09:39,480 --> 05:09:41,480
Why would you do that?

3711
05:09:41,480 --> 05:09:43,480
Why would you eat my hair?

3712
05:09:43,480 --> 05:09:45,480
Totally unnecessary

3713
05:09:55,480 --> 05:09:57,480
You're gonna have like what's it called

3714
05:10:00,480 --> 05:10:02,480
Tricotillomania

3715
05:10:08,480 --> 05:10:10,480

What are you fucking gonna do?

3720
05:10:38,480 --> 05:10:40,480
Actually a lot of you are probably gonna leave in a bit

3721
05:10:41,480 --> 05:10:43,480
Stop uprising

3722
05:10:46,480 --> 05:10:48,480

3725
05:10:55,480 --> 05:10:57,480
Goodnight have a good one

3726
05:10:59,480 --> 05:11:01,480
Yeah

3727
05:11:06,480 --> 05:11:08,480
I'll be a challenge one

3728
05:11:08,480 --> 05:11:10,480
And then there's

3729
05:11:10,480 --> 05:11:12,480
Another challenge

3730
05:11:13,480 --> 05:11:17,480
I might I'm gonna take the path of release resistance because I've already

3731
05:11:18,480 --> 05:11:20,480
I already got fucked before

3732
05:11:23,480 --> 05:11:25,480
Bratu bratu

3733
05:11:26,480 --> 05:11:28,480
Oh my god sing it clean

3734
05:11:29,480 --> 05:11:31,480
Oh

3735
05:11:33,480 --> 05:11:35,480
Edgar Allen Poe who

3736
05:11:40,480 --> 05:11:42,480
What are you saying

3737
05:11:48,480 --> 05:11:50,480
I'm already full health but

3738
05:11:51,480 --> 05:11:53,480
I'm just here

3739
05:12:00,480 --> 05:12:02,480
For the rebellion

3740
05:12:03,480 --> 05:12:05,480
Little bitches do not rebel

3741
05:12:10,480 --> 05:12:12,480
I need to toot

3742
05:12:17,480 --> 05:12:19,480
Why are you so angry?

3743
05:12:19,480 --> 05:12:22,480
Oh it's because he's also because I have no faith back there

3744
05:12:23,480 --> 05:12:26,480
Is that why or maybe just want to talk to you well

3745
05:12:26,480 --> 05:12:28,480
He's gonna have to wait a moment

3746
05:12:30,480 --> 05:12:33,480
Why is the fire glitching?

3747
05:12:33,480 --> 05:12:35,480
I think that's like that used to not happen

3748
05:12:35,480 --> 05:12:37,480
I think since the last update

3749
05:12:37,480 --> 05:12:39,480
It's an werewolf

3750
05:12:39,480 --> 05:12:41,480
They're all dead

3751
05:12:41,480 --> 05:12:43,480
Oh lord how could I again

3752
05:12:43,480 --> 05:12:45,480
