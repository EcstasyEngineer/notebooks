1
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:54,720
okay

2
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,460
help your

3
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:04,020
midst

4
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:11,280
uh

5
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:16,280
a

6
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,460
sorry we had a couple technical difficulties

7
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:26,460
and I'm very E.P., and Touma has the giggles.

8
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:35,460
I don't know. The indie record's got to be with that one. If she don't talk to her, I don't talk to her.

9
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:40,460
That's pretty good, actually.

10
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,460
That's really good.

11
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:52,460
I might steal that. I might make that a stream title at some point.

12
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,460
That's funny.

13
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:57,460
That's a really good one.

14
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:02,460
Oh my gosh, I didn't. We got to have a little scuff.

15
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,460
Just a little bit.

16
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,460
Just a little bit.

17
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,460
It adds the flavor. It's like seasoning.

18
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:16,460
Just a little bit of zinnacea.

19
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:29,460
I feel like I hear Reina jumping somewhere, and I feel like she's going to start singing the song of her people very soon.

20
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:33,460
We do love it. We do love when they sing the songs of her.

21
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:39,460
Yup, I think she was an opera singer in a previous life.

22
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:43,460
Have you ever considered taking her to a pet psychic?

23
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,460
Oh, bless you.

24
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,460
Sorry. What?

25
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:50,460
Have you ever considered taking her to a pet psychic?

26
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,460
That would be so funny.

27
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:57,460
She was maybe one of the George Washington cats or something?

28
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:02,460
Oh my gosh. I'm going to do that. Take my cat to a psychic and tell me about her.

29
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:07,460
I actually, at my last job, I had a customer who was just like,

30
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:12,460
I'm like, oh, because I try to make conversations so I can make recommendations for products.

31
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:16,460
And I was like, oh, what do you do for work?

32
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:19,460
And she's like, oh, I'm a medium.

33
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:23,460
I'm like, like the size?

34
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,460
And she's like, no, I'm a spirit medium.

35
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,460
I'm like, oh, OK, that's cool.

36
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,460
And I'm like, the fact that you can do that for your job is pretty cool.

37
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,460
I said that in my head, not allowed.

38
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:39,460
And I was like, when you said I'm a medium, my first instant like thought was,

39
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,460
I don't know, you look like a small to me.

40
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:44,460
Yeah, like I was literally in my head.

41
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,460
I was just like, like the size clothes.

42
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:51,460
Like, I guess that might be like a little bit, you know, valid, but like,

43
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:57,460
but, you know, and she's, I'm like, oh, that's neat.

44
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,460
How long you've been doing that for?

45
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:02,460
She's like very long time, like 20 years.

46
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:06,460
I help connect people's passed away pets to their loved ones.

47
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,460
And I'm like, no way.

48
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,460
What?

49
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,460
And she's like, yeah, here's my website.

50
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:16,460
And she pulled up this entire website and it was like really well made.

51
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,460
And I'm just like, wow.

52
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:21,460
And she's like, you've had someone who's passed away.

53
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:26,460
And I'm just like, yeah, she's like, don't worry, she's all right.

54
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,460
And I'm like, what the?

55
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:31,460
What are you talking about?

56
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:37,460
Let me just jumped up and bonked his head on the microphone.

57
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,460
It's so funny that that happened to you.

58
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:44,460
Like I had a very similar experience except I was on a plane and the guy was looking

59
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:48,460
over at me and he's like, all right, tell me about your spiritual journey.

60
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:52,460
And I'm like, huh?

61
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,460
That's so wild to me.

62
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,460
Just like people just like dial in.

63
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,460
They're just like, hmm.

64
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,460
Yeah.

65
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:04,460
So tell me about this time when you were.

66
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:07,460
It's like there's a little bit of psychology to it almost.

67
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:12,460
Tell me this time when you were a kid and the trauma and the person and this and the

68
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,460
people in your spiritual team.

69
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,460
And you're just like, I don't know.

70
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,460
I don't know.

71
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,460
I don't know.

72
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,460
I don't know.

73
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,460
I don't know.

74
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,460
I don't know.

75
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,460
Hello, everybody.

76
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,460
Hello.

77
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:33,460
That's our free, our opening app is about the interesting people we run into that are

78
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:36,460
psychic mediums.

79
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:39,460
They're cold open.

80
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:43,460
And if you're new here, hello, because I see some new faces.

81
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,460
My name is Sheeby Cottonbomb.

82
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:53,460
I'm your favorite girl failure, dumb bunny girl of Gen 1's indulge vealer.

83
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:59,460
And I like to do fun, wacky voices and dress up my characters.

84
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:02,460
And then this is Trinket.

85
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,460
Hello.

86
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,460
I'm Trinket.

87
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:09,460
I'm your favorite step dog or your dog in law.

88
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:13,460
It just depends on how you feel about me at the time.

89
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:17,460
And you'll find me on Tom McCuse's channel on Twitch.

90
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:22,460
But you know, I'm a visitor to the YouTube sphere.

91
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,460
Yeah.

92
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,460
She comes over every once in a while.

93
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,460
Hello, Raiders.

94
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,460
Oh, it's a Scotland raid.

95
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,460
Hello, Scotland.

96
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:34,460
I hope you guys had a very nice stream.

97
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:43,460
You know, you know that real, you know what surprised me that I'm 25% from Scotland.

98
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:47,460
Oh, yeah, that's right.

99
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,460
Trinket Scottish.

100
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,460
Just like me.

101
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:53,460
I'm also 25% or something like that.

102
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:58,460
I'm a bit of a mutt, but like I already knew that.

103
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:03,460
I know I barked like Goddard from Jimmy Neutron there for a second.

104
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,460
He's a full quarter guys.

105
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,460
I think I'm actually like 20%.

106
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,460
Actually, I'm not, I'm not 25.

107
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:21,460
So, Toma Trinket is more Scottish than I am.

108
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,460
Let me tell you.

109
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,460
Sorry.

110
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,460
It's raw attitude.

111
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,460
That's what it is.

112
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,460
It's raw.

113
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:34,460
It's all, all the attitude came from the Scottish portion of the pie.

114
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,460
But Trani, I hope you had a good stream.

115
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:40,460
Make sure you get some rest or, you know, knowing her.

116
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:45,460
I feel like sometimes she raids me and then just starts another stream like an hour later.

117
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,460
Cause she's like, she's just on that grind, you know.

118
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:51,460
But make sure you rest, Momay.

119
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,460
Thank you very much.

120
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,460
And I hope you guys, if you guys want to stick around, feel free.

121
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:59,460
Or you can go like hang out whenever.

122
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,460
Yeah, have some water.

123
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,460
Have a snack.

124
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,460
Take a nap.

125
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,460
Don't take a nap.

126
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,460
Treat yourself.

127
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,460
Take a walk.

128
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,460
Put us in your ears.

129
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,460
Take us with you.

130
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,460
We're good for a laugh.

131
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,460
We're good for...

132
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:13,460
I think you can physically put us in your ears.

133
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:16,460
Like shrink me down.

134
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:20,460
We could misfrizzle it up in their brains.

135
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,460
Yeah.

136
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,460
Okay.

137
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:25,460
So we can crawl into your ears and we can just whisper sweet nothings to you.

138
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,460
That would be a good ASMR actually.

139
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,460
Yeah.

140
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,460
It's like, okay, put me in the strength device.

141
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,460
Okay.

142
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,460
Now shrink me.

143
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,460
I'm going in.

144
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,460
I'm going in.

145
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,460
I'm going in.

146
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,460
She doesn't remember.

147
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,460
Stream in five minutes.

148
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,460
Okay.

149
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:43,460
That makes sense.

150
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:49,460
But for you, for you, for those that's sticking around, thank you for coming.

151
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:52,460
We have had this little mini series.

152
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,460
Oh, did you Pokemon smash or pass?

153
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:57,460
We are currently on the 200s.

154
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:01,460
But did you want, did you want to chat a little more?

155
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,460
I loved chat.

156
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,460
Yeah, me too.

157
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,460
You know, I'm a serial yapper.

158
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,460
That's true.

159
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:11,460
We would be here for like five hours between the both of us.

160
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,460
It's true.

161
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,460
I guess.

162
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,460
Sorry.

163
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,460
I keep interrupting.

164
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,460
I'm so terrible.

165
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,460
No, no.

166
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:23,460
It's because Discord has the bit of a delay.

167
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,460
So we'll both start and then we'll both stop.

168
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,460
That's a good point.

169
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,460
I was, I also am terrible with pot.

170
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,460
I can't tell when people pause proper.

171
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,460
Like, when do I talk?

172
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:41,460
Well, I have the same thing because like, I, I know my dramatic pauses can be pregnant,

173
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:47,460
but like, I don't know if anyone else has like pregnant pauses like me.

174
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:52,460
Um, I was telling Azura, because Azura was telling me that she pauses for a while too

175
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:57,460
to think, and I'm the type of, so it's funny because like when I talk to Azura, um, she

176
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:03,460
will talk and then pause because she's thinking, and then I go to talk because I don't want

177
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,460
to forget my thought.

178
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:09,460
And she's just like, wow, it's definitely ADHD for you.

179
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:13,460
And I'm like, I just want to make sure I don't forget.

180
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:19,460
Well, I mean, I mean both ADHD, but like different.

181
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,460
Different.

182
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,460
Different flavors.

183
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,460
Different flavors.

184
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,460
The worst type is the type that makes you forget.

185
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:32,460
That happens a lot because I was like, you, you were talking earlier and I'm like, what

186
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,460
was I even talking about?

187
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:38,460
I was talking about Twitch versus YouTube and why it's good for us as a company to be

188
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,460
on YouTube.

189
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:44,460
And I'm like talking and then I just, I was tweeting at the same time that I was live

190
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:48,460
and then I just totally forgot what I was talking about.

191
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,460
And then Trink had to remind me.

192
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,460
Well, that's okay.

193
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:57,460
Do you ever like just window shop and like you're thinking, oh, I should look that up,

194
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:01,460
but you're continuously looking at the thing that you were looking at and then you forget

195
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,460
the thing that you were about to look up.

196
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:08,460
And so you have to like do the little song and dance of, okay, what was I thinking about?

197
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,460
I was thinking about this arbitrary thing.

198
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,460
Okay, that's what I wanted to look up.

199
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,460
And it comes like 30 minutes later.

200
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,460
Yes.

201
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,460
The worst.

202
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:24,460
Alternatively, I managed to look it up, but then I go down a rabbit hole of looking up

203
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:30,460
stuff because like, I remember I was like looking up an actor from a TV show because I was watching

204
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:33,460
Vikings and I'm like, I swear I've seen this person before.

205
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:37,460
And then I fell in this rabbit hole of all their like filmography.

206
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:40,460
And then I was going through other films that were just in the same genre.

207
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:45,460
And then I woke up and the TV show was like half over through the episode and I'm like,

208
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,460
okay.

209
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:50,460
Well, I have to go back and re-watch this now.

210
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:54,460
Oh, I hate when that happens or when you're watching anime and you kind of check out when

211
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,460
the stuff is going.

212
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:59,460
You're like, oh my God, I don't know what the plot's going on about now.

213
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,460
You just like totally like disassociate your eyes cross and you're just like watching,

214
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,460
but you're not reading.

215
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,460
Yeah.

216
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,460
Oh my God.

217
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,460
Oh my God.

218
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,460
I actually fell down a rabbit hole maybe like a few months ago about when I was looking

219
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,460
at plushies, right?

220
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:17,460
Because like I have a need to be underneath a bunch of plush toys.

221
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,460
Oh, very nice.

222
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,460
You know.

223
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,460
Very comforting.

224
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,460
It is.

225
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:26,460
It's so comforting and they're so comfortable and like it just weighs on you like a bunch

226
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,460
of puppies, but they're still alive.

227
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,460
Dead puppies.

228
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,460
I'm sorry.

229
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:35,460
Dead puppies, the opposite of dead babies.

230
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:40,460
But like the rabbit hole was, did you know that there's just like a genre of plushies

231
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:46,460
where you just have mama animals just giving birth to like little baby animals?

232
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,460
What?

233
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,460
Yeah.

234
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:54,460
It's like they're the big mama cat and then she has like a zipper and then like a bunch

235
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,460
of babies come out of her.

236
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,460
Wait, I actually have seen stuff like that.

237
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:02,460
You could pull like all these like little kitten thingies and there's like many versions.

238
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,460
I've seen, I have seen that version.

239
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,460
I thought you meant like.

240
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:09,460
It's not like the for real pets though.

241
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:12,460
Oh, it's like newborn.

242
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:15,460
Oh, it's weird.

243
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,460
Wait.

244
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:21,460
Now I'm curious and I want to.

245
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:24,460
So I'd be a leg.

246
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,460
Okay.

247
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,460
Okay.

248
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,460
Let me grab.

249
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,460
I've seen like the newborn like alive stuff.

250
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:34,460
Oh, and there's different types too because it's not just like puppies.

251
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,460
Like I'll give you the snake one too.

252
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,460
There's a snake one.

253
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,460
Yeah.

254
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,460
There's a snake one.

255
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,460
In fact, I'll link that one first.

256
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,460
I would like the snake one.

257
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,460
I like snakes.

258
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,460
So here's the snake one.

259
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:50,460
And then like the pictures are really funny to look at.

260
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:53,460
Oh, here's a bunny one for you.

261
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,460
You know, nothing.

262
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,460
Nothing too.

263
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,460
What the?

264
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,460
Oh, they're so cute.

265
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:03,460
And it's like a zipper egg.

266
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,460
Yes.

267
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,460
Okay.

268
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:11,460
I might be adding this to my, to my throne because this is kind of adorable.

269
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:17,460
And then like if you get down like the egg rabbit hole on Etsy, like you'll find that

270
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:23,460
there are silicone eggs to like, you know, experience.

271
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,460
Oh, yeah.

272
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,460
Alien, alien giving.

273
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,460
Interesting.

274
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:32,460
Fascinating.

275
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,460
And again, you're a bunny.

276
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,460
So like you already know about that with Easter and stuff.

277
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,460
Yeah, yeah.

278
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,460
Of course.

279
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:43,460
It's like I was, I was raised on that knowledge.

280
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,460
Of course.

281
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,460
Everybody knows eggs come from bunnies for Easter.

282
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,460
Yeah.

283
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,460
So like you don't need to know about obby position or nothing like that.

284
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:54,460
No, no, that's, that's, that's old news.

285
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,460
That's old news.

286
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:59,460
Trying to fix my shirt.

287
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,460
Pardon.

288
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,460
Yeah.

289
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,460
I'll tell you what is new.

290
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:06,460
Face huggers for Easter.

291
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:09,460
Face huggers for Easter.

292
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,460
Yeah.

293
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,460
When are we going to incorporate face huggers?

294
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,460
Aliens are the new bunny in my mind.

295
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,460
Well, you know what, you're not wrong about that.

296
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:26,460
I'm assuming you've seen the new Romulus trailer, right?

297
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:29,460
I have not seen the new Romulus trailer.

298
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,460
I have popcorn bucket.

299
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:37,460
No, no, there's a scene with a face hugger that I know you would love.

300
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,460
Oh my God.

301
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:42,460
I'm going to find it for you right now.

302
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,460
I'm not going to lie.

303
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:48,460
Face huggers are a special interest for some of us.

304
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,460
Oh no.

305
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,460
You are good.

306
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,460
Yeah.

307
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:54,460
You're going to love it.

308
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:57,460
I mean.

309
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:04,460
I mean, it's not a Pokemon, but like Smash.

310
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,460
Hold on.

311
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:18,460
I'm making sure this is the right trailer.

312
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,460
I'm excited.

313
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:22,460
Also, I'm a little scared.

314
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,460
As you should.

315
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:27,460
Every action of a spooky movie trailer.

316
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,460
Well, actually, it won't be the full thing.

317
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:32,460
It's going to be one scene from that trailer.

318
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:36,460
Maybe it's cut down on Twitter because I can't find it on there.

319
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:40,460
Well, yeah, because that's where all the freaks are on Twitter.

320
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:45,460
I saw it like posted like a bunch of times.

321
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:52,460
And then I'm like, wow, Twitter is indeed a bunch of freaks.

322
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:56,460
Come on.

323
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,460
You got this.

324
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:02,460
I believe in you.

325
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:07,460
If I just look up face hugger.

326
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:10,460
Well, maybe that could work.

327
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,460
I don't know.

328
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,460
Well, maybe people are making a lot of cool.

329
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:18,460
There's a face hugger 3D phone holder.

330
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,460
That looks pretty sick.

331
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,460
I'm not going to lie to you.

332
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:28,460
So like, so like, we all know that the hose underneath it is it's like a thing, right?

333
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,460
Yeah.

334
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,460
Okay.

335
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,460
Okay.

336
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:35,460
Because like, when I was a child, I didn't understand that.

337
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,460
I didn't either.

338
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:44,460
But now I understand it as an adult.

339
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:53,460
And I'm very, I'm very grateful for the wisdom that I have.

340
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,460
Did they clean off this clip?

341
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,460
Where is it?

342
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,460
Oh, no.

343
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,460
I literally.

344
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,460
You know what?

345
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:04,460
Hollywood is full of a bunch of cowards.

346
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,460
Where did they go?

347
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:09,460
I literally just looked it up on the tick talk.

348
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:13,460
It was the and it didn't.

349
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,460
It was going to bother me.

350
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,460
I'm determined now.

351
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,460
Okay.

352
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:22,460
But you could, you could move on to the next, the next topic.

353
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:26,460
I will continue to search.

354
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:29,460
Let me think the next topic, huh?

355
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,460
Oh, shit.

356
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,460
I just had a topic too.

357
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,460
And I've forgotten it.

358
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:38,460
Well, that's okay.

359
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:42,460
Wait, I might have it.

360
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:45,460
We, we think we found it.

361
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,460
You know what?

362
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,460
Hollywood is a bunch of cowards.

363
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,460
That's what I was talking about.

364
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,460
There we go.

365
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,460
There we go.

366
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,460
Because like, okay.

367
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:56,460
So Hollywood always does this thing where they try to make you think that

368
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:59,460
something is sexy when you clearly know that it's not supposed to be.

369
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,460
Yeah, they definitely did that.

370
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:06,460
Like one of the things that the nineties in the early 2000s would try to

371
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,460
make you think is sexy is bees.

372
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,460
What?

373
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:14,460
It's like the weirdest bee propagate I've ever seen.

374
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,460
Cause like, oh, ween bees.

375
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:19,460
Oh, there's a bee and she looks kind of human.

376
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:23,460
The bee movie.

377
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,460
I found it.

378
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,460
Yeah.

379
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,460
Okay.

380
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,460
Not safe for words.

381
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,460
Oh.

382
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,460
Oh.

383
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,460
Oh.

384
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,460
That's a, right?

385
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,460
Isn't that crazy?

386
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,460
Oh, that's a, that's a clip, right?

387
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,460
Right?

388
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:44,460
I was like, I remember watching the trailer and I'm like, I had a visceral

389
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,460
reaction.

390
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:50,460
I was on, I was, I was, I didn't know what to think.

391
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,460
Can you see?

392
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:56,460
Google it yourself.

393
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,460
Oh, hi, Mercy.

394
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,460
Mercy will believe in the bee propaganda.

395
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,460
No.

396
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,460
All right.

397
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:06,460
You, you don't, you don't have the eyes for Barry, for Barry Benson.

398
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,460
Do you?

399
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,460
Oh.

400
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,460
The bee.

401
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:13,460
But yeah, he's so seductive to the human race.

402
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:17,460
How could you ignore such a voluptuous bee?

403
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:21,460
I mean, with such, with such riveting conversation starters as,

404
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,460
you like jazz.

405
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:27,460
But like,

406
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:32,460
he's kind of a stud.

407
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,460
You know what?

408
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:38,460
Like, bee movie makes me think a lot.

409
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,460
Like Patrick Warburne's character.

410
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:43,460
I feel like he was justified in being really hurt.

411
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,460
Oh.

412
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:50,460
I'm actually getting blown off by your girlfriend for a bee.

413
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:53,460
You think they actually did anything?

414
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,460
Like her and, her and Barry?

415
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:59,460
I 100% believe so.

416
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:02,460
Also, how come we never see the queen of Barry's high?

417
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,460
That's a great point.

418
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,460
You never see the queen.

419
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:08,460
You only see the, the, like the, the flyers, the drones.

420
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:13,460
And then that's, and then like there's a mayor.

421
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,460
Yeah.

422
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,460
Or something.

423
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:19,460
She's too hot for TV.

424
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:21,460
She probably is honestly.

425
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,460
Probably.

426
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:27,460
Or maybe they, they didn't want to push a bee propaganda, but they did for like

427
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,460
male bees and not female bees.

428
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,460
Yeah.

429
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:34,460
Maybe they just did like a little like control group and being like, we're like, okay,

430
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:37,460
which do you find more attractive?

431
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:44,460
And they showed, uh, they showed, uh, what's a Barry Benson?

432
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:47,460
And then they showed the queen bee and then they were just like, sorry, Barry.

433
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:54,460
Like he's just, he just oozes more, uh, sensual stuff.

434
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:58,460
But do you want to see a Holly would be that like lives in my head or in free that I think

435
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,460
about from time to time?

436
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,460
Show me.

437
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,460
Oh, I'm such a nun.

438
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:06,460
By the way, I'm very, I'm very holy today.

439
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,460
Queen bee.

440
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,460
Oh, that's where is that from?

441
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:12,460
That's from two stupid dog show.

442
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:16,460
Oh, I've never seen that was on boomerang.

443
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:21,460
Well, I mean, it was on Cartoon Network first, but yeah, I guess you could say it was on

444
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,460
boomerang.

445
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,460
You see very offended.

446
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,460
I said boomerang.

447
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:30,460
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not offended.

448
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,460
I'm not offended.

449
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,460
Speak your truth.

450
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,460
Talk about boomerang.

451
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:38,460
What's, go off sis.

452
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,460
I know you want to.

453
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,460
Okay.

454
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,460
So this, this particular episode, right?

455
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:48,460
It's not so much that she's all, she's a queen bee who's like super sexy, right?

456
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:54,460
It also has like her force feeding secrets, girl, her royal honey jelly and hypnotizing

457
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:57,460
him to be in love with her.

458
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,460
I might have to watch this episode.

459
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,460
Yeah.

460
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:03,460
And she was basically going to make him her little love slave.

461
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,460
Oh my gosh.

462
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,460
Yeah, pretty much.

463
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:10,460
Who is behind the writing of the show?

464
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,460
It was episode.

465
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:16,460
I mean, I, it's literally on the picture I sent you.

466
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,460
Oh, you're right.

467
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,460
I'm staring at it.

468
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,460
I'm literally staring at it as I say it.

469
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,460
Mark.

470
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,460
Sarah.

471
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:27,460
Sarah Cheney, you, Sanny, whatever, you are something else, sir.

472
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:34,460
You need to praise the Lord and look inwards and self reflect.

473
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:41,460
But like, but you know, hypnosis wasn't really mainstream, a big thing.

474
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:47,460
Well, actually, no, it was very mainstream hypnosis was like go to plot point in the

475
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,460
90s and the early 2000s.

476
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:54,460
We've only recently started like stepping away from like just hypnosis in general.

477
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,460
Interesting.

478
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,460
Because I realized it works on people.

479
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,460
Oh yeah.

480
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:03,460
No, it's because probably this is a conspiracy theory.

481
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:07,460
We talked about mind control so much that the government was like maybe mind control

482
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:10,460
work and now we don't talk about mind control so much.

483
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:17,460
Because never met using mind control so much.

484
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:20,460
I might have to agree with that statement.

485
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,460
But like, you didn't hear it from me.

486
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:25,460
I'm just a silly little dog.

487
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:30,460
Yeah, I'm just a silly bunny talking to this little dog.

488
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,460
And you know, I never know.

489
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:35,460
Yeah, she's a nun and I'm a belly dancer.

490
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:38,460
We're just two peas in a pod.

491
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,460
Two peas in a pod.

492
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,460
Maybe.

493
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:46,460
They're not if they're watching, you know, I have the Lord and Jesus and anime on my

494
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:49,460
side, so I'll be fine.

495
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:55,460
Okay, should we start the.

496
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:59,460
We should we should we should actually start.

497
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:02,460
This is gonna be a very holy stream 100%.

498
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,460
It's why I'm dressed like this.

499
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,460
Everyone got their Bibles.

500
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,460
Everyone Bibles out.

501
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:13,460
I was going to start with the scripture.

502
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:17,460
So I hope you guys enjoy.

503
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:20,460

I'm misdreavus look like a little booty butt head.

507
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:46,460
Honestly, you could make her look like a used napkin.

508
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:52,460
If you if you just like, like.

509
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:56,460
You went zero to 100 so fast.

510
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,460
Was I supposed to?

511
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:01,460
No, you're fine.

512
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:08,460
I'm just my my innocence was shattered in that one sentence.

513
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:14,460
You can make her look like a used napkin use tissue if you want to.

514
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:20,460
I mean, I mean, like she's already got a pearly necklace.

515
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:25,460
All you need to do is add your own.

516
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,460
Trinket got jokes today.

517
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:33,460
Oh my God.

00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:38,460
I can't even I can't I was going to be like I'll steal her pearl necklace.

519
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,460
You could do that too.

520
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:44,460
But you could replace it.

521
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,460
I can't breathe.

522
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:49,460
I'm sorry.

523
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:52,460
I'll pull back a little bit.

524
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:55,460
No, no, no.

00:33:55,460 --> 00:34:01,460
It's a it's a very this is a very good cop bad cop.

526
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:06,460
Light versus darkness.

I'm a nun.

528
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,460
You're a belly dancer.

529
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:11,460
You're the devil on the shoulder.

530
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,460
I'm the angel.

531
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:19,460
I like it.

532
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:24,460
I kind of want to eat it for some reason.

533
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,460
I don't know.

534
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:29,460
Yeah, it looks like a little gummy candy.

535
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:32,460
Yeah, like I take a chunk out of it.

536
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:36,460
Yeah, I'm assuming you'd smash though, correct?

537
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:38,460
Yes, I'm building the smash.

538
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,460
All right.

539
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:42,460
I would pass but eat.

540
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:53,460
If I was a male, then I would totally understand smashing this.

541
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:56,460
This is a letter.

542
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,460
This is a drawing.

543
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,460
This is a sketch.

544
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:04,460
This is the eye that you sketch in your notebook in high school when you're bored.

545
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:10,460
I mean, I guess I could get hooked on phonics.

546
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,460
I don't want to pass.

547
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:22,460
I don't I don't want you could use the appendages though, but he just be staring the whole time.

548
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:27,460
I mean, he can watch ever watching like the Lord.

549
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,460
Yeah, it's fine.

550
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:34,460
Like it's like exhibitionism, but like a solo audience.

551
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:40,460
It's like it's completely just glaring at you no matter what.

552
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:43,460
I'm gonna.

553
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,460
I'm passing.

554
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,460
I'm smashing.

555
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,460
What?

556
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,460
No way.

557
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,460
I'm surprised.

558
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,460
Well, I mean, it's no different than a toy.

559
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,460
It's just alive.

560
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,460
That's true.

561
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:59,460
I didn't want the reminder was left.

562
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:03,460
If I'm just using it as a tool depends.

563
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:08,460
Um, maybe it's just like cool with it.

564
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:11,460
Yeah, probably.

565
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,460
Whoa, buffet.

566
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,460
Wow.

567
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,460
Okay.

568
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:23,460
But like, what was that got knocked back because if you hit wabba fat, it bounces back at you.

569
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:26,460
Like twice as hard.

570
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,460
So that's something to consider.

571
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:31,460
I don't know if I could take that.

572
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:38,460
I mean, I'm saying smash because I like wabba fat.

573
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:48,460
I would say pass because he's got a goofy face and I would probably just laugh too hard and I get distracted and couldn't finish my scripture.

574
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:51,460
I mean, you're not trying hard enough.

575
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,460
If you can't finish your scripture.

576
00:36:53,460 --> 00:37:00,460
Maybe, okay, maybe I'll sit in the chair for that one.

577
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,460
I'll learn your ways.

578
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:05,460
I'll have to like see it for myself.

579
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,460
I'll pray to high heaven for you.

580
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:10,460
Thank you.

581
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,460
Smash your.

582
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,460
Hallelujah.

583
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,460
Yeah.

584
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:15,460
Is this some sort of Bible study?

585
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,460
Yeah, it is.

586
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,460
Yeah.

587
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,460
This is a Bible study.

588
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:20,460
It's a very unique Bible study.

589
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,460
Yeah.

590
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:26,460
If you want to just open your website to smash viticus 202.

591
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:28,460
We're on wabba fat.

592
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:30,460
And first wabba fat.

593
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:32,460
First wabba fat, yep.

594
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:36,460
And the Lord said wabba.

595
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:45,460
And the Lord said, as this person said, gonna wabba on this.

596
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:48,460
Why are you mocking religion?

597
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:51,460
I am not.

598
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:54,460
I am being say so.

599
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,460
Yeah.

600
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:57,460
I'm trying to behave.

601
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:03,460
She is, I'm trying to change her from her terrible ways.

602
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:08,460
Trying to show her the Lord's light.

603
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:12,460
Are you trying to make me repent for my wicked ways?

604
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,460
Yeah.

605
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:16,460
Making you repent from your wickedly ways.

606
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,460
I don't know.

607
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,460
I'm trying to earn a scarlet letter here.

608
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:22,460
And that letter is an A.

609
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:29,460
You are well on your way.

610
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,460
Trying to turn into less of a furry?

611
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:32,460
Yes.

612
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:41,460
All the furries must be cleansed.

613
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,460
I don't think she'll be able to convert me.

614
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,460
I don't think so.

615
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:47,460
She's pretty stern in her beliefs.

616
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,460
Very, very solid.

617
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:54,460
It might be very difficult.

618
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:55,460
I'm a furry.

619
00:38:55,460 --> 00:39:00,460
I would like evidence your honor.

620
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,460
Scroll down real quick.

621
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,460
Scroll down.

622
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,460
Scroll down.

623
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:04,460
What are you?

624
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:09,460
You don't mind?

625
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,460
We can improve it right here.

626
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:12,460
I'm leaving.

627
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,460
I'm walking away.

628
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,460
I'm leaving.

629
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,460
I'm out of here.

630
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,460
Goodbye.

631
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,460
Oh my God.

632
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:21,460
I'm out of here.

633
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:24,460
Well, exhibit A, as you can see.

634
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:31,460
We have so many choices here that prove the madam may or may not be a furry.

635
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:35,460
Your honor, I was coerced.

636
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:46,460
I know I'm really good at public speaking and selling, but that's a straight up Gyarados.

637
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:52,460
I see at least two cats are marked.

638
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:55,460
There's a turtle, two snakes, two.

639
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:59,460
You got a few of them.

640
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:02,460
I'm being corrupted.

641
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:09,460
Anyways, I'm passing.

642
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:15,460
Yeah, the unicorns too, huh?

643
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:20,460
Garafrig.

644
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:29,460
Well, I don't got to tell you nothing, but two heads are better than one.

645
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:36,460
Oh my God.

646
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,460
This looks like a really cute.

647
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:44,460
I wouldn't want to pet this in a petting zoo and just not make eye contact with the tail.

648
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:45,460
That's rude.

649
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,460
I will have to.

650
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,460
I'll have to pet.

651
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,460
Well, not like a pet.

652
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:49,460
Wait, did you say?

653
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,460
What did she say?

654
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:51,460
That's rude.

655
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,460
Why is it rude?

656
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,460
You can't.

657
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:54,460
This will put my little petting zoo.

658
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:55,460
Yeah, but the tail deserves attention too.

659
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,460
Oh, okay.

660
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,460
You got that cute little face.

661
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:58,460
You can say no to that cute little face.

662
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:59,460
It reminds me a lot.

663
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,460
I don't know.

664
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,460
I don't know.

665
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,460
I don't know.

666
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,460
I don't know.

667
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,460
I don't know.

668
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:05,460
I don't know.

669
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,460
I don't know.

670
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,460
I don't know.

671
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:08,460
I don't think I've seen her.

672
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,460
I've seen her.

673
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,460
And there's attention to an.

674
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,460
Okay.

675
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:13,460
Cute little face.

676
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,460
I think no to that cute little face.

677
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:20,460
It reminds me a lot of like do you remember soul eater?

678
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:22,460
Did you ever watch soul eater?

679
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,460
Yeah, I did watch the leader.

680
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:24,460
I love Maka.

681
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:27,460
Do you remember like Krona and like.

682
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:30,460
What the heck is it's little.

683
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:34,460
And it's a little freak the guy who disrespected.

684
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:43,340
a time, poor baby. That's what this reminds me of. Or Venom. It's just Pokemon Venom.

685
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:50,060
You know what? I could see Chrona being remade in Pokemon as a Molly or a Mawile.

686
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:56,060
Yeah. Oh, actually, very, very good. I would 100% agree with that.

687
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:02,540
Maka was like my favorite though. I liked Maka and I enjoyed Soul Leader up until like the last

688
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:09,820
three episodes. Because like the manga wasn't finished when it was being like ran. So they

689
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:14,780
had the bullshit and ending and it was like ugh. Yeah, I love the bowl. Yeah. But then you read

690
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:24,540
like the canon ending and the manga and you're like ugh. Dang. Wait, I have a question. Yeah.

691
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:35,340
It's popping to my head. Because Squishy said which is the back. But then

692
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:40,540
how does it eat and where does it expel from when it's done?

693
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:51,020
Well, I mean, it's probably got regular genitals. So like the giraffe head is like the front part

694
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:59,260
that eats. But like the tail probably has like a carnivoreistic uh carnivoreistic sort of situation

695
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:05,900
going on where it'll eat like any sort of prey that's behind it like a bird. Yeah, I feel like

696
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:12,460
I would like buy that thing so I'd like get too close and like consume them. Yeah. It's like catdog.

697
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:17,980
Yeah, I don't even want to like catdog always bothered me for that reason. Yeah, because like

698
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:23,020
in catdog the situation was the genitals were like located under the armpit.

699
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:33,340
What? Is that canon? Yeah, it is. It is canon. I didn't even know that.

700
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:39,340
Yeah, because like whenever dog needed to go he would have always left one of his leg.

701
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:46,780
Oh my gosh, you're right. And then cat would do the same and they always had like the litter box

702
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:56,460
and the hydrant sort of situation. Oh my, why did I never put that together that well obviously if

703
00:43:56,460 --> 00:44:01,660
it's going from there if it's pee pee in from there it's gonna poo poo from there too. They

704
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:06,700
got some stinky armpits then. Yeah, they do. Imagine like having that right in next to your face.

705
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:09,100
I mean,

706
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:18,380
else are into that. But I always like catdog. I thought it was a funny. Oh no, I love catdog. I

707
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:23,180
was just yeah, I was always confused because I would ask my mom like how do they use the bathroom

708
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:29,580
though? My mom's like it's just a cartoon. I'm like okay.

709
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:38,220
Is it either packing too? Well yeah, of course.

710
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:46,060
But what are you feeling for this one smash or pass? I'm gonna say pass because it gives me a mental

711
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:53,900
headache. Smash. Okay. Which side would you pick?

712
00:44:54,220 --> 00:45:00,060
The underside. What are you asking?

713
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:09,340
Like say you're going in for a smooch.

714
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:19,100
I'm not kissing that. Well, you'll take that but you're not gonna.

715
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:21,900
No, why would I kiss a horse?

716
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:35,340
Oh my god, a pinecone.

717
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:44,380
I know pinecones you can make into food and there's like seeds and stuff you can eat.

718
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:52,460
I know I'm an obligated like omnivore but I'm not eating that.

719
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:59,580
Yeah, I feel like it would be like too crunchy to be like eating like bark. So I'm gonna say

720
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:05,580
it knows explosion and hardened. Yeah, but it looks like too sharp. Like look at the top part.

721
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:08,460
I can't use that. That's too many ridges.

722
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:13,100
During a bible study, that'd be terrible.

723
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:19,180
All right, lay it on me. Come on.

724
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,660
I wouldn't smash his pine nuts.

725
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:31,660
You're such a dark.

726
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:41,580
But I wish I had that as like a thing I could pull out.

727
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:47,980
Oh brother, this dog sticks.

728
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:52,460
No, that's not fair. It's hot out.

729
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:54,380
No.

730
00:46:57,100 --> 00:47:01,180
Ow, I just got like a pain in my jaw after drinking my lemonade. What the heck?

731
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:05,900
I think that was karma. Yeah, get her karma. Get her.

732
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:14,300
Okay, flared. Well, like you could use it. You could use the pointy part as like

733
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:22,860
where you pull it out. If you turn it upside down, I guess it could be like a masochistic plug.

734
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:29,260
Yeah, like ribbed for no one's pleasure though. Yeah, I feel like that would just cause like

735
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:33,740
internal bleeding. And then I kind of feel bad because his eyes would be all up in there,

736
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:40,780
but just be dark. I feel like his eyes would like let be cast upon by cheeks.

737
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:46,540
Oh, that's like like lightly peeking out. Yeah, just lightly peeking out because like

738
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:50,780
it's it kind of flares like right underneath where the eyes are.

739
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:54,380
Yeah, you're good. That's a good point. So yeah, I guess it would just be peeking out.

740
00:47:55,100 --> 00:48:02,300
Yeah, fill in O. You know, I'm all for self flagellation and in the name of the Lord,

741
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:06,540
I'm going to smash the pine cone. Understandable. Have a good one.

742
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:10,380
I've been convinced.

743
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:16,540
Oh, Boomi came up in this grooming Fia. I have Fia on my desk right now.

744
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:22,780
She even and Boomi is giving her a kiss. I was she kind of got like messy when I was feeding her.

745
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:27,900
So I'm kind of glad that Boomi is cleaning her face. Oh, he's probably just going in for the

746
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:33,020
extra food. Literally, that's why I'm like, that's fine. You can't sit on her though, Boomi.

747
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:40,860
So she's laying in my bed. Um, for Tret, I honestly, I don't like the name of this one

748
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:44,220
because it doesn't look like a fortress. Like I know it's very like locked down.

749
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:48,460
But yeah, it's not on it. Should it be like a forest?

750
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:55,180
How I don't understand how you would do this one. It's like,

751
00:48:56,540 --> 00:49:04,140
like one, maybe like super 10 point accurate, like rosebud sort of suction toy. Maybe. Yeah.

752
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:10,220
But then that's so boring. This one's boring. Maybe you could use it as a double ended.

753
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:17,580
Boomi, you just sat on Fia's face. Maybe. Did you guys hear her squeak?

754
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:30,380
He just sat on her face. Are you okay? Yeah, that's what I was thinking, Kevin. I was thinking

755
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:35,660
like a party for like you and three friends. Yeah, that's why I was like a double ended sort of thing.

756
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:40,620
Kind of like kind of like the multi pussy for like a bunch of guys.

757
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:47,100
Have you ever seen that? Yeah, I've seen that. It's like a like a whole like thick disc.

758
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:54,140
Yeah. And like multiple guys can get in on it. Somebody said that there should be one for

759
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:59,820
Vila of all of us and then you can just like switch it around when you want to.

760
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:03,340
And I remember is different.

761
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:18,300
Um, I'm gonna say no because I feel like I would accidentally push air up something.

762
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:25,340
Yeah. And I would just and I would say queef and I would just queef. Yeah. Oh, it's my baby.

763
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:36,060
Baby Don Spas. I love baby Don Spas. He's the most useless Pokemon. I kind of want to eat him. He looks

764
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:43,820
like butter. He looks like butter. Yeah. But he also looks like he'd be a pretty cool looking plug.

765
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:50,540
He would be pretty cool looking plug. Yeah. Look at his tail. I feel like either end.

766
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:58,300
Honestly, like he could get up in there. Honestly, I just want to cuddle him. He's too cute for me.

767
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:04,140
He like I just want to eat him. I'm going to say pass but eat because he looks like butter.

768
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:10,380
I'm passing it and I'm cuddling. He's he looks like gummy. I want or like a gummy bear. I'm going to

769
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:16,700
I mean, I mean, you wouldn't be hurting nothing. Ain't no thoughts behind them eyes.

770
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:21,820
That's true. He's just hanging out. Gligar. Gligar. I can't talk.

771
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:30,620
Gligar. Yeah. What's that? What's that? What's that tongue do?

772
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:40,460
I like his little scorpion tail. I've always liked gligars. Yeah. I always thought he was like

773
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:49,420
a better version of a Zubat. Yeah. He's got little pointy toes. Yeah.

774
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:57,660
Little tail. You could probably use that as like beads, tongue, little handles.

775
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:03,500
He's got poison though, right? He's got poison though. Yeah, but he could maybe he can control it.

776
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:13,100
I don't know. You risk that paralysis if you want. Well, I either way, I want the tongue.

777
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:20,300
Oh yeah, the tongue definitely. And then I can use the horns as handlebars.

778
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:29,660
Or and you can also use the little snippy snips as nipple clamp. Oh, of course.

779
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:36,620
He's just utilizing friendly. Yeah. Utilitarian.

780
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:45,020
I'm going to say smash. Me too. Nope. This is a pass. Felix is a pass.

781
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:53,180
Why? Come on. Give him a chance. You give him a chance. No, I'm good. I don't like

782
00:52:53,180 --> 00:53:00,300
Stelix like that. Or Stelix mega looks cool to look at would probably kill me.

783
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:09,420
Yeah, I guess I can't see. It would hurt. Not in a good way. I'd probably just perish.

784
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:19,020
Yeah. Oh, snubble. I've always liked snubble. Again, a lot of Pokémon were ruined for me

785
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:25,100
with the live action movie. Snubble was one of those. Oh, I thought snubble was cute in the live

786
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:30,700
action. It was too like hyper realistic for me. I think I think Pikachu was the only like cute one

787
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:38,220
for me. Well, that's because he's the title character. Yeah, good point. Um, they had to do

788
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:46,060
I'm going to pass on snubble though. She looks like a bratty little child. I just want to take

789
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:50,300
her by her little ear ponytails and just throw her around like Matilda.

790
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:56,780
You know, I think I'll also pass only because like there's a better one coming.

791
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:01,980
Yeah. Yeah, pass. Granbull.

792
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:11,580
Yeah, I'm good. I don't like it. I like it. I'm a smash.

793
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:16,780
All right. It's a little bit better. It loses the dress and it gets some skin.

794
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:23,340
That's a good point. Is it wearing like some sort of bandana or is it a collar?

795
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:30,220
I think it's a collar. Okay. No grand pussy. No grand pussy. No. Thank you.

796
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:34,300
The teeths. What I don't want anything to do with those teeths.

797
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:37,180
I don't know. They're kind of cool.

798
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:44,540
Okay. What about a quill fish? Eating it.

799
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:52,860
And getting it prepared by a fancy chef who knows how to handle puffer fish because they are poisonous.

800
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:58,300
Do you think quill fish are like poisoned in the same way that a puffer fish is?

801
00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:04,620
I feel like their liver would or whatever it is that's poisonous. I think it's the liver. Yes.

802
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:10,460
I would have thought it was like the swim bladder. That's a thing fish have, right? Yeah.

803
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:19,660
I don't remember. I haven't watched like a puffer fish preparation video in a while.

804
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:22,460
I usually like to watch one every month. I'm not even joking with you.

805
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:26,860
I just like to watch people do catch and cook videos.

806
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:33,660
I got so sad when that really cute one surfaced. You know the one where it's like,

807
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:41,740
wow. It's like eating the carrot. Oh yeah. And it was like biting some. That was a wow.

808
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:50,460
And then like at the very end, like they just kind of slap it a little bit and then they

809
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:54,300
wipe its mouth and then they're just carrying it away and you see him pick up the knife.

810
00:55:54,300 --> 00:56:00,140
I first saw that video and I was like, no. Wait, I didn't even know they killed it afterwards.

811
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:07,580
I don't remember. Oh gosh. That's so sad. At least it doesn't have to like live with the

812
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:17,100
embarrassment of having that done to you. No. Oh my gosh. So like a couple of months ago,

813
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:23,420
I was watching TikToks, right? And there was a guy, there was a guy who caught a fish, right?

814
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:29,100
And he slapped the fish a few times after he took his hook out. He spit in the fish's mouth.

815
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:38,380
I saw that. I'm like, what did that fish do to you? Why are we sexually harassing fish that we

816
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:49,340
catch? Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. What about the history version? No, that's a no for me. But it does look

817
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:59,740
cool. Scissors look cool. Yes. Smash. Smash. Just like Scyther. I don't know why. I don't know what it

818
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:12,060
is. He just looks good. Yeah. Cut that body, otty, otty. Oh. The mega version. Smash. But like,

819
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:18,380
I don't know because those look scarier than the other claws. That's okay. You don't have to worry

820
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:25,260
about those other claws. All you got to worry about is like the plate on the front. All right,

821
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:30,940
I'll smash you. Do you think it like descends and like whatever's on the inside just sort of like

822
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:37,500
that? It just like, like it falls open like it's like a ship, like a spaceship door opening.

823
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:45,500
Or maybe it like heads and then it like regrows after the deed is done. Oh my god. Or maybe you

824
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:52,140
can pop it off. Maybe it's just armor. He's like, let me undress and then it's just like and then

825
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:55,580
then the boogersies is there.

826
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:07,980
Shuckle. How do we feel about this bug? I want to eat it. It does look like it's kind of tasty.

827
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:14,860
Yeah, I feel like I could fry it up like a clam. I don't know. It also kind of seems smashable.

828
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:19,420
But yeah, it does. Like I don't know why I feel like I get like a tentacle vibe from it.

829
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:28,540
Yeah. And if I was a dude, all those holes. Yeah, very holy. This is one for the girls,

830
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:36,140
like for you and your besties. Yeah. All right. Are we tag team in the Shuckle?

831
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:43,180
Yeah, we're tag team in the Shuckle. All right. Smash tag team the Shuckle. Hell yeah.

832
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:53,500
Options are definitely. Shibi, what haven't you eaten today? I literally just got food before

833
00:58:53,500 --> 00:59:00,860
I got home and I ate it in like five seconds and I had a cookie afterwards. But like I'm still hungry

834
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:06,700
because it wasn't a lot of food. It was a small sandwich and I have some lemonade.

835
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:11,340
And I really just want seafood right now, I think.

836
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:22,140
You know, I think I could go for like a burgy. Like a what? A burgy. Ooh, a burgy.

837
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:30,060
A little burger poo. And a little flinty flies. Ooh, a little flinty fly. What do you feel

838
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:35,660
love french fries? They steal my french fries. That's really crazy. Uh,

839
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:45,660
hair cross. Uh, smash. Smash. Yeah, I've always liked his face. You know, I'm gonna give him a chance

840
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:55,100
because I feel like I don't know. I also just kind of want to ride him. Not like, not like that. I'm

841
00:59:55,100 --> 01:00:03,420
like, I'm like, you can ride him like just, just, just like one leg on each side of the long horn

842
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:10,540
and then get the antenna. Yeah. Like he takes off and so and you blast off and everybody's just

843
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:20,220
having a good time. Yeah. I'm squashing that bug. Um, oh, what about this one though? I don't know why

844
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:28,140
it has like a vent opening in the front there. Maybe because it gets too hot. I'm very confused by that.

845
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:36,220
Maybe, maybe the, maybe the power doesn't come from like the groin area. Maybe all the

846
01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:44,300
pleasure is like up in the face. I feel like you could use it as a grinder if you're like brave.

847
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:47,900
I feel like it'd be the situation of a mandolin.

848
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:54,700
I think I, I like this one's face though more than the other one. I like how he's like,

849
01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:03,660
it's okay. I like the other one's face, but this one's okay. I don't think I would smash though. I'm

850
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:16,940
gonna pass. Uh, nah, I'm gonna pass as well. Up. Sneezel. Smash. Smash because she's serving.

851
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:22,780
She do serve. She just, she's just cute. She's like a little sassy little bratty.

852
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:27,340
She like do something. She could be like, you know,

853
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:37,100
yeah. Same with the history version. Look, oh, look, oh, look, oh, mesugaki, she looks.

854
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:45,260
Are you talking to me? Oh, I didn't, I didn't think so. Yeah, like literally, she's so smug.

855
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:52,860
I like it. She's so smug. Like, oh, are those your shoes? They're ugly. Trash.

856
01:01:53,340 --> 01:02:05,980
Trash. She needs correcting. Yes. Uh, Teddy Ursa. Baby. Oh, pass. Baby. That's a baby. That's a

857
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:14,700
snuggle. Pass and snuggle. Hug. Hug and snuggle. Yeah. Oh, Ursa ring.

858
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:25,180
I'm trying to think of a pun with its name and I can't.

859
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:37,660
Ursa ring around my rosy. Take a pocket full of my posy. Ursa ring of my belly. Yeah, that was better.

860
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:45,020
Oh, smash. Ursa ring a ling. Ding, ding.

861
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:54,620
Oh, I think my headphones be dying. Hold on. Oh, no, you gotta plug them suckers in.

862
01:02:54,620 --> 01:03:00,380
I don't even know where my charger went. What the heck? I unplugged it so I could use my camera

863
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:07,180
and now I don't know where the plug went. Oh my god, no. The fairies took it. Oh, there she go.

864
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:14,380
She's chasing fairies. Literally. I literally left it on the floor. What the? What the heck?

865
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:23,500
I see it. I said a hey. Ha. A hey. A hey. Sorry. Sorry.

866
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:31,180
Mental. Mental. Mental stim. I haven't heard that song in like forever. Same, actually.

867
01:03:32,620 --> 01:03:40,380
You know where I first heard that song from? Well, it was like on a Dollar Tree CD that had a tomato

868
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:48,060
on it and it had like a whole bunch of songs and I never understood like why I found this.

869
01:03:51,980 --> 01:03:58,220
Dollar Tree used to sell CDs. Now they sell DVDs. Chalk this up to Boomi having stole it.

870
01:03:58,220 --> 01:04:05,820
Oh, I found it. I don't remember it going there, but okay. And it was tied up nicely. I think I'm

871
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:14,140
just forgetful. You did it. Yes. You did this. No, it was the fairies. It was those little house

872
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:23,020
hobgoblins. Oh, you've got those too? Yeah, what do they call them? Just hops? Common hop? Brownies?

873
01:04:23,020 --> 01:04:31,820
Brownies, yeah. Sorry. Don't apologize to Boomi. Don't apologize to Boomi. He know what he did.

874
01:04:32,540 --> 01:04:40,940
Boomi just, you guys literally just heard Boomi sit on Fia's head when she's resting after being

875
01:04:40,940 --> 01:04:47,980
in the emergency room today again for the second time this week and he just sat on her and crushed

876
01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:57,100
and she went back because he's big and he suffocated her. Boomi's not innocent. He's a menace. Fia,

877
01:04:57,100 --> 01:05:07,420
I will stand up for you or fight for you. Because I really like goldfish. I love goldfish.

878
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:19,020
I'm trying to think of another snack I can have. Crackers. I don't have any crackers.

879
01:05:19,980 --> 01:05:22,940
I think. Do you have cookies? No.

880
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:30,940
I kind of wish I had more of that cake that I made, but I had to throw some of it away.

881
01:05:33,020 --> 01:05:42,060
Yeah, I wonder why. I wonder why nobody knows. Don't know why it happened, but it did. Oh,

882
01:05:42,060 --> 01:05:48,060
Boomi hopped in a box. He's so cute now. All right, he's back to being a good boy. I think I have like

883
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:55,020
chips, but I'm not sure. I don't know. I'm too lazy to cut up. All right, continuing on.

884
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:08,300
It's a slugma. Slugma ball. I want to eat it.

885
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:17,020
It looks spicy. Yeah. I'm just passing. I was playing Alan Ring yesterday and there's like

886
01:06:17,020 --> 01:06:25,500
these magma bosses that literally look like this in volcano manner and they're like little lava slugs,

887
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:31,500
and I also want to eat them. So I'm going to be fair and say I want to eat. It is lava. I don't

888
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:37,660
care. I'm eating it. It's forbidden spicy honey. Yeah, literally. Look at that. It's like it's

889
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:43,500
literally just hot honey. It's hot honey. That's how I'm going to say it. Like I literally want to

890
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:48,220
eat molten glass. It's so pretty and it looks so delicious. Oh, yes. So delicious. Do you see that

891
01:06:48,220 --> 01:06:54,940
video of the people like pouring molten glass into like normal already regular glasses and they

892
01:06:54,940 --> 01:07:05,260
explode? Yes. Oh, so good. So good. I remember, do you see the video? Do you sometimes get like

893
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:11,100
the video of the jars and full of stuff that roll down the stairs and break? Yes.

894
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:19,100
Do you get the British lady that reacts to that? Yes. She's so funny. Oh my god. She's like, oh,

895
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:25,260
that's a good one. Oh, that was terrible. No, I didn't like that one. I like her with the hydraulic

896
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:32,220
presses. Yeah, she's good with the hydraulic presses. She's very relatable. Is that the French

897
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:38,140
one? I think that's actually the French lady that I'm thinking of. Well, there's an English lady

898
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:44,460
that does it. I know the French lady. I know the French lady that you're talking about.

899
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:51,340
Although, can I ask you something? Yeah. What is up with like, you ever see those like

900
01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:59,740
dharma like dramas like, oh, the racism, oh, the elderlyism, oh, the non-professionalism,

901
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:07,500
like it's always like a made up scenario that. Oh, yeah, the Darman stuff. Yeah, it's like maybe you

902
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:13,660
shouldn't judge books by their cover or whatever. Right, right, right. But like,

903
01:08:14,860 --> 01:08:19,260
like lately, though, they've, they're, they're just people sitting in the corner of them

904
01:08:19,260 --> 01:08:29,020
just watching and I'm like, huh? Oh my gosh. What's happening? I noticed that too. Like,

905
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:35,020
I got a recommended thing like that in my YouTube shorts and I was confused because I'm like,

906
01:08:35,020 --> 01:08:39,500
why am I watching someone react to something like they're like sitting in their desk?

907
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:46,220
Like, it wasn't even like a face cam react. It was like, just in the corner, they're like full

908
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:53,500
on full body, like they're in a podcast and they recorded it live. And I'm like, I was really confused.

909
01:08:55,500 --> 01:09:03,020
Like, I don't, I don't think there's a market for react Andy on short TikTok skits.

910
01:09:03,980 --> 01:09:07,980
No. If there is, I wish there wasn't.

911
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:14,940
No. Uh, my cargo.

912
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:25,340
Mag cargo. My cargo. Like, my, my cargo. Michelangelo.

913
01:09:25,340 --> 01:09:33,580
I, it's a pass for me, but I do want to play like with the Dooley dops, like on the side of his face.

914
01:09:33,580 --> 01:09:37,900
Just be like, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop. Knock him, knock him back and forth.

915
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:42,300
He looks like he got good swing. He looks like a character from turbo.

916
01:09:45,820 --> 01:09:49,900
He does look like a character from turbo. I feel like you could play with his, like,

917
01:09:49,900 --> 01:09:54,540
with his little face troops too, like balls, like stress balls.

918
01:09:54,540 --> 01:10:01,020
I'm going to eat them. I'm going to eat him again. He is a snail. Actually, I don't think I've ever

919
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:06,780
had like as cargo and like a snail before. I wonder what they taste like. I don't know. I've never

920
01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:12,380
tried that. I wonder if I would like it. Whenever I think, every time I think as cargo, I think

921
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:17,420
fly me yet satisfying. Because like I like oysters and stuff. So maybe I would like it.

922
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:24,380
Maybe. I'm eating this sleepy thing.

923
01:10:25,980 --> 01:10:31,100
That's why now. It looks like a perfect sized ham.

924
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:39,660
I mean, you're not, you're not wrong, but this is a baby. It also looks like that demon slayer

925
01:10:39,660 --> 01:10:46,700
character in Osuke. It does look like an Osuke. Wait until you see the evolved form.

926
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:56,780
I'm eating it. I'm not. Pillows slime. There he is. There's an Osuke. Yeah. I always pronounce

927
01:10:56,780 --> 01:11:04,780
Japanese names wrong. I'm so sorry. I like its floppy ears and that is like a little mammoth.

928
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:13,820
I don't think I eat this though. I'd eat it. It's bigger. It's bigger. More meat on the bones.

929
01:11:13,820 --> 01:11:19,820
I don't know. Floppy ears to like put me off. I just want to pet it. You can do bow.

930
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:27,980
Eat it and pet it. Yeah, we eat cows all the time, but we also cuddle them too. Oh no, you're right.

931
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:33,980
Okay, I guess I'll eat it too. I've been convinced.

932
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:43,260
Two, two, two. Chancey of the sea. Chancey of the sea. Corsola.

933
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:54,220
She's just really cute. Yeah, like I kind of want to just either want to eat or hang out with her.

934
01:11:54,220 --> 01:11:58,700
And I like I would maybe try to use a little pointy nubs, but I feel like

935
01:12:00,380 --> 01:12:07,900
they'd just be too like the fork. Just wouldn't be attractive. The fork and bits.

936
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:13,500
No, honestly, that's a rock.

937
01:12:15,740 --> 01:12:19,980
Smash. Someone said smash. It's coral.

938
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:23,020
It's coral.

939
01:12:25,340 --> 01:12:26,700
Coral. Sorry.

940
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:35,980
I want to say it's like rock candy. That's what I mean. It looks like a hard candy.

941
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:42,300
Like you could definitely get some nibbles off of the nubs. Yeah, a little gobstopper moment.

942
01:12:43,740 --> 01:12:44,540
I'm going to pass.

943
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:51,500
Yeah, I'm going to pass too because I can't see the grind.

944
01:12:52,780 --> 01:12:57,900
Why are these both the same? Oh, I didn't mean to smash that one.

945
01:13:00,140 --> 01:13:03,180
I didn't mean to smash the ghost. Bring me back.

946
01:13:04,220 --> 01:13:08,620
I would notice why are they both two, two, two? That's weird. Do the other ones do that too?

947
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:14,060
I think for the glare and kind, yeah. Okay.

948
01:13:16,220 --> 01:13:22,700
No, let me pass. Okay, thank you. I'm like, I don't want to. I don't want to do anything to the ghost coral.

949
01:13:24,620 --> 01:13:28,700
It does look chronically depressed because all the coral reefs are disappearing. That's why.

950
01:13:31,420 --> 01:13:36,140
Protect our reefs. Again, I love seafood. Eat.

951
01:13:36,140 --> 01:13:41,820
Uh, I don't, but it's a fish and I ain't smashing so pass.

952
01:13:42,700 --> 01:13:48,700
I like how it's reminiscent to the remora, which like hangs out by whales and sharks

953
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:54,220
and like hangs out and like sucks on them, you know? Yes.

954
01:13:55,820 --> 01:13:58,780
A little, a little co, a little co-partner. Yeah.

955
01:13:58,860 --> 01:14:09,180
Yeah. Octillery smash. That's literally just a rose in tentacle form. And then tentacles. How big is octillery?

956
01:14:10,620 --> 01:14:12,620
Big. Perfect.

957
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:20,300
Like, like the mouth is probably like the size of the lady anatomy.

958
01:14:21,340 --> 01:14:27,980
Yeah. So I can just like, just take it all in. You know what? I'm going to add a BGM. I realize I didn't have one.

959
01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:38,380
You guys didn't tell her that she didn't have a BGM. You're just hearing us like our, our silences every once in a while.

960
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:47,660
There we go. A little subtle, a little subtle BGM.

961
01:14:49,980 --> 01:14:55,020
62 pounds. It's two feet 11. Oh, okay. Uh, deli bird.

962
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:01,900
Smash. Smash explain.

963
01:15:03,820 --> 01:15:09,660
All right. I just really like the way he looks. I like his vibe. I mean, I know he's a bird.

964
01:15:10,780 --> 01:15:17,180
But it just seems like he's got clothes and like he can pull anything out of that sack.

965
01:15:17,820 --> 01:15:20,540
That's true. Oh, that's why I was going to rob him.

966
01:15:22,140 --> 01:15:25,980
He probably comes with his own toys. Should I do a smash and grab?

967
01:15:29,420 --> 01:15:33,020
Yeah. Smash and grab.

968
01:15:35,180 --> 01:15:40,300
Because like, he's still, he's still like a criminal of the highest crime.

969
01:15:41,420 --> 01:15:44,220
He's just, he's just a little guy committing crimes.

970
01:15:45,580 --> 01:15:51,420
He, he's, he looks like Seattle. So he's got to be, he's got to be smashed and grabbed. There's nothing.

971
01:15:52,620 --> 01:15:55,820
There's no, there's no other way to put it. He's just got to be smashed and grabbed.

972
01:15:55,900 --> 01:16:00,700
What is deli bird supposed to be? I know obviously like a bird. They kind of look penguin-y to me.

973
01:16:01,980 --> 01:16:08,940
Yeah, it's a penguin. Oh, okay. Oh, that's why it has a sack. But why is, oh, is it deli like

974
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:14,060
delight or something? I don't even know. Where does the name come from?

975
01:16:16,140 --> 01:16:20,780
Probably some weird bird. Yeah. Oh, like a new deli penguin.

976
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:34,300
Like a new deli penguin. That's probably. Oh, delivery. Like a mailman. Oh, delivery bird. It delivers presents.

977
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:41,900
Oh, man time. I don't know what I could do. I would just hang out with it. It's just cool.

978
01:16:41,900 --> 01:16:46,300
I would just like when I lay on its back and fly around like coldly Yoko.

979
01:16:50,860 --> 01:16:57,340
I was literally about to start singing the song and he got be me to it.

980
01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:07,420
I got you homie. Okay, I'm passing on man team. Maybe I'll rewatch coldly Yoko.

981
01:17:08,620 --> 01:17:14,780
Oh, that would be fun. Yeah. Did I tell you that I had a brain stint the other day where I was just

982
01:17:14,780 --> 01:17:20,860
thinking of cute little girlfriend names to call periods. Like if you're a vampire.

983
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:29,980
Give me one. Vampire buffet. Vampire buffet. I like to say little ketchup packet.

984
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:37,500
Little blood bag. Yeah, little little gusher or fruit gusher.

985
01:17:38,140 --> 01:17:45,100
Mm hmm. Blood moon. I know people like say that like, oh, aunt flow is coming.

986
01:17:47,660 --> 01:17:56,380
Yep. It is the other Red Sea. It's a vampire magnet. Vampire magnet. Maybe start calling it vampire week.

987
01:17:58,940 --> 01:18:04,540
Or the Cullens are coming. Oh, man, that's not the only thing.

988
01:18:07,740 --> 01:18:13,820
Crimson tide. I've also, I don't know if you've ever watched Salt Burn.

989
01:18:16,540 --> 01:18:19,900
Okay, so I'm afraid to watch Salt Burn. How was that?

990
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:25,340
It was good because yeah, I think, did you like briefly stop by during the member stream for that?

991
01:18:25,340 --> 01:18:34,140
I forget. I didn't. Okay, you're fine. I'm fine. But yeah, no, it was great.

992
01:18:34,940 --> 01:18:40,780
There's, then there was indeed a sin, green serenade. It was lovely. It's a great, I love

993
01:18:40,780 --> 01:18:46,140
that movie. That's why I watched it twice. I'll watch it again. I just like watching other people

994
01:18:46,140 --> 01:18:54,780
watch it and being like, what? I love sharing movies with people so that they can experience.

995
01:18:54,780 --> 01:19:00,220
There's a movie on YouTube that was made by a guy. It's like over 12 years old and I just show it to

996
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:05,340
random people sometimes. So I can get a fresh reaction for it. It's called Theven.

997
01:19:07,180 --> 01:19:14,380
Say it again? Theven. Why is it so familiar sounding?

998
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:20,380
I don't think I've ever shown. No, I want you to show me. Well, we can do that another time.

999
01:19:21,740 --> 01:19:25,660
Now I want to react with you to whatever that is. If it's

1000
01:19:26,620 --> 01:19:33,260
you as friendly or you just do that off stream. Oh, yeah, no, it's only 29 minutes.

1001
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:39,340
Perfect. I'll give you the link so you can see what I'm talking about.

1002
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:41,100
Like, oh my God.

1003
01:19:45,980 --> 01:19:56,220
Your giggles. What is this? It's season. Oh my God. It's it's one of my

1004
01:19:58,300 --> 01:20:05,820
Tila Khanathan Studios. Oh, it's made by an Indian company. No, it's made by one person.

1005
01:20:06,620 --> 01:20:11,580
Oh, okay. One dude, then impressive. I'm just gonna.

1006
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:16,140
This just reminds me of the globgulab.

1007
01:20:18,620 --> 01:20:25,340
Is this really the same person? It's the same art style. No, they use the same engine.

1008
01:20:27,100 --> 01:20:33,660
They used blender. Oh my God. It's so sometimes like unpolished blender

1009
01:20:34,380 --> 01:20:41,100
3D stuff is so terrifying looking. But he's gotten better. It's like clay. Like this was

1010
01:20:41,820 --> 01:20:49,020
this was his first movie. He's gotten better. And it truly is an experience. I'm watching this guy

1011
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:55,740
run up to a house all goofy. And it's got subtitles, but it doesn't have voice acting.

1012
01:20:56,700 --> 01:20:59,420
Whoa. Wait, why is this woman bald?

1013
01:21:01,580 --> 01:21:09,260
Oh, you skipped to the end. No, I didn't. I literally skipped two minutes in. Oh, then you're good.

1014
01:21:11,980 --> 01:21:14,460
She's offering him tea. Okay, I'm getting distracted.

1015
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:20,940
Oh, am I sharing this on stream? I am. You are.

1016
01:21:24,220 --> 01:21:27,020
Oh, no, I'm gonna get claimed. I'll have to cut that out.

1017
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:31,740
Oh, it's fine. It's not a big deal.

1018
01:21:33,020 --> 01:21:43,660
Wait, you didn't? You didn't like share any audio? Well, even so, YouTube has the AI that

1019
01:21:43,660 --> 01:21:51,900
watches your stuff and will claim it. I did a watch along of Twilight for people who don't

1020
01:21:51,900 --> 01:21:58,860
know. And I pixelated the crap out of it. And it was still managed to get claimed. And I didn't do

1021
01:21:58,860 --> 01:22:05,740
any audio or anything. It was a heavily pixelated. It looks like that one shade of blue that you see

1022
01:22:05,740 --> 01:22:13,340
when you watch the Twilight movies. And this still has identified. So they have a crazy AI for that.

1023
01:22:14,380 --> 01:22:18,940
Oh, they're training it too well. They're training it on hentai.

1024
01:22:21,980 --> 01:22:31,180
If you can uncensored this hentai video, then you're good enough to demonetize content.

1025
01:22:31,180 --> 01:22:32,540
Honestly, I believe that.

1026
01:22:35,580 --> 01:22:42,220
If I can tell what's going on after this pixelation, then you're hired. Otherwise,

1027
01:22:42,220 --> 01:22:47,580
get out of my office. And the AI just slumped back to its little AI dorm room. And he's like,

1028
01:22:47,580 --> 01:22:56,380
Beep, beep, I'll never be able to uncover what this hentai means. Beep, beep, beep. Beep, boop.

1029
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:05,740
Wow. If you ever, if you ever get like an AI chatbot, I'm gonna train it so it says that.

1030
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:14,540
How you doing today, training an AI chatbot? Beep, boop, beep. I'm okay. Beep, boop.

1031
01:23:18,220 --> 01:23:32,620
Skarmory. Back to this. Yeah, back to this. Beep, boop. Beep, boop. It probably would slice me in half.

1032
01:23:35,820 --> 01:23:40,780
Beep, boop. I think I'd pass, but like, you could probably get some good meat if you got underneath

1033
01:23:40,780 --> 01:23:48,860
like the metal. True. Beep, boop. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Gonna pass. Yeah, fast. Beep, boop.

1034
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:50,620
Uh, hound door.

1035
01:23:50,620 --> 01:24:13,340
Well, I know what my answer is. I, I'm gonna pass.

1036
01:24:13,980 --> 01:24:29,660
I, well, it's a very stylish dog, you see. He's, he's got his own, like, he's got his own bone

1037
01:24:29,660 --> 01:24:36,940
bangles and he is very stylish. I've always liked rottweiler's and how they look.

1038
01:24:41,420 --> 01:24:48,220
Are you gonna smash the hound door? You know, he's a puppy, so I think I'll just say pass on this one.

1039
01:24:48,620 --> 01:24:54,780
See, again, how doom, however. Yeah, now that's a die.

1040
01:25:03,660 --> 01:25:09,180
The limbs are a little, the limbs are a little longer. He's got double the bangles, double the

1041
01:25:09,180 --> 01:25:15,900
style. He's got his own handlebars for, you know, ease, a spay tail for spanking.

1042
01:25:16,700 --> 01:25:22,780
He's got a home. That's a, that's a, that's a utility knife houndoon dog right there.

1043
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:32,460
Yeah, like, he goes really well. He goes really well with none cosplay. Yeah, he matches me really

1044
01:25:32,540 --> 01:25:41,340
well. It's like a, I'm gonna, I'm gonna smash. Yeah, smash on houndoom, you know.

1045
01:25:41,340 --> 01:25:52,700
Smashing houndoom. Smashing houndoom. Oh, see, see, Satan comes to town only, only twice a day.

1046
01:25:54,380 --> 01:26:00,060
That's more than some people, right? That's a lot of pointy things though. Can he take that off?

1047
01:26:01,020 --> 01:26:10,460
I mean, no, but like, it's, like, look, it's, it's not towards the back, so he's more utility friendly.

1048
01:26:10,460 --> 01:26:13,260
Okay. Yeah, I'll smash the mega version.

1049
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:19,020
How do you feel about Kingdra?

1050
01:26:21,580 --> 01:26:28,220
It has a goofy face. I don't like it. It's like a really long nose and not a mouth.

1051
01:26:28,380 --> 01:26:33,900
Yeah, I, it's not horsey, so it's a passport. Yeah.

1052
01:26:37,020 --> 01:26:44,220
Aw, baby! They just remind me of the adventure time character.

1053
01:26:45,260 --> 01:26:48,140
Tree trunks? Yeah, may she rest in peace, the VA.

1054
01:26:49,340 --> 01:26:54,460
Yeah. I'm gonna say pass. Yeah, definitely pass.

1055
01:26:55,420 --> 01:27:00,860
Are you about to do a tree trunks impression? I was gonna try. Try it.

1056
01:27:03,820 --> 01:27:07,660
Wait, I need a tree trunks clue. I don't, I don't have a proctonate knowledge enough.

1057
01:27:10,860 --> 01:27:14,780
Yeah, she did pass away. I love tree trunks though. She was so goofy.

1058
01:27:14,780 --> 01:27:19,260
She was like, this is such a silly character. I remember seeing a clip of like who she was

1059
01:27:19,260 --> 01:27:25,820
based off of, which was like this one like woman and she's just like singing R&B, but she's like

1060
01:27:25,820 --> 01:27:33,820
this like really older, um, elderly white woman and she's just singing, slightly rapping at this

1061
01:27:33,820 --> 01:27:40,940
like black dude who's like stalking around her. She's like seducing him and it was really funny.

1062
01:27:41,820 --> 01:27:43,580
And that's who she was based off of.

1063
01:27:43,660 --> 01:27:49,180
Yeah, respectful pass on panfy.

1064
01:27:50,540 --> 01:27:54,780
Respectful, but don't fan. However, that is going to crush me.

1065
01:27:56,620 --> 01:28:02,860
I mean, you get, you get like a gate for him. The rest is like front legs on and you're

1066
01:28:02,860 --> 01:28:06,300
yeah, I just feel like it's like, I don't know.

1067
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:11,660
He's just got the vibe of a leather daddy, you know, that's a good point.

1068
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:17,660
Hmm. Like, like he's a real sleek and sexy looking design. If you asked me,

1069
01:28:18,220 --> 01:28:21,660
I'd probably use the top as a grinder.

1070
01:28:24,220 --> 01:28:32,220
Maybe just like right on top and be like, but he can also lay on his back.

1071
01:28:32,220 --> 01:28:36,860
That's a good point. But again, think of the, the size.

1072
01:28:36,860 --> 01:28:41,820
Although we are anime girls, so we should be fine.

1073
01:28:43,260 --> 01:28:48,460
Also, if he's on his back and you're on the top, then you can control the speed of which you go.

1074
01:28:49,180 --> 01:28:54,300
Yeah. And the depth, which would be out my mouth probably.

1075
01:28:57,660 --> 01:29:00,940
Yeah, like all the way through the thing, right?

1076
01:29:01,660 --> 01:29:06,780
Yeah. Then right back out. Follow, follow through.

1077
01:29:09,100 --> 01:29:13,100
You know what? I think I've been convinced. I'll, I'll smash the Don Fun.

1078
01:29:14,460 --> 01:29:21,900
I'll smash. Well, you guys could already tell. Ah, yeah, the smooth Porygon, better Porygon.

1079
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:23,740
I'm going to eat it. It's a jelly bean.

1080
01:29:25,100 --> 01:29:27,100
I'm going to smash it. It's smooth.

1081
01:29:27,980 --> 01:29:34,620
How? It's circular. It's smooth. It's, it's, it's anatomy friendly.

1082
01:29:34,620 --> 01:29:38,060
Yeah. But what do you, where do you put it? What part do you put?

1083
01:29:39,340 --> 01:29:42,380
So like the tail can go in and so can the beak.

1084
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:49,020
Like the tail can go in. The beak can go in. You can, you can sit behind the head.

1085
01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:55,340
It's got, it's got utility. How, how big is the Porygon too?

1086
01:29:56,300 --> 01:30:00,460
Probably not that big. Because I'm thinking of like rubber duck size.

1087
01:30:02,380 --> 01:30:05,740
But I bet it's bigger. Yeah, it's probably bigger.

1088
01:30:07,180 --> 01:30:12,700
Okay. I might watch just to learn, but I'll pass for now.

1089
01:30:15,580 --> 01:30:18,940
Fair. It's two foot 72 pounds. Jesus.

1090
01:30:19,980 --> 01:30:22,060
See, that's, that's, that's toy size.

1091
01:30:22,540 --> 01:30:25,020
Ooh. That's a good point. I get it.

1092
01:30:27,020 --> 01:30:31,340
Uh, Stantler. Pass. Pass.

1093
01:30:32,620 --> 01:30:36,460
I really hate its tail. I really hate its face.

1094
01:30:39,740 --> 01:30:44,140
Like we already had a cute year Pokemon. Why do you have to make this abominate?

1095
01:30:44,140 --> 01:30:47,980
Yeah. If it, if it, honestly, if they fix the face and the tail,

1096
01:30:48,940 --> 01:30:52,380
I would have a great time, you know? Yeah, it doesn't look like a tail.

1097
01:30:52,380 --> 01:30:53,740
It looks like a giant booty cheek.

1098
01:30:54,940 --> 01:30:58,540
It does. Let's lopside it. Passing on Stantler.

1099
01:31:00,380 --> 01:31:03,660
Smeargle. Smeargle.

1100
01:31:06,620 --> 01:31:10,300
I feel like he'd be good. Yeah. For like foreplay.

1101
01:31:11,740 --> 01:31:14,860
Yeah. Like you could do body painting, body writing.

1102
01:31:14,860 --> 01:31:15,820
He could tickle you.

1103
01:31:16,780 --> 01:31:21,340
Yeah. He, he probably drawn your nipples.

1104
01:31:21,340 --> 01:31:24,780
Yeah. I think it would be a very intimate session.

1105
01:31:26,140 --> 01:31:27,580
Yeah. And his little tongue.

1106
01:31:28,780 --> 01:31:32,460
Yeah. And he's a cute little guy.

1107
01:31:32,460 --> 01:31:35,180
Yeah. You know, I'll give the short king a chance.

1108
01:31:36,460 --> 01:31:37,660
Yeah. How could you see?

1109
01:31:39,980 --> 01:31:42,220
I wish it showed like their information.

1110
01:31:42,220 --> 01:31:45,980
Hey. Because I'm kind of, I'm kind of wondering that.

1111
01:31:45,980 --> 01:31:47,180
Oh, I did pass. No.

1112
01:31:51,660 --> 01:31:55,660
Perfect. Okay. I've never been with that.

1113
01:31:55,660 --> 01:31:57,020
We've never been for it back.

1114
01:31:59,660 --> 01:32:03,900
Irma. I kind of want to kick this sassy child.

1115
01:32:05,100 --> 01:32:06,860
It does look like a sassy child.

1116
01:32:06,860 --> 01:32:09,500
Like, I feel like he's going to pull my pants down.

1117
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:13,020
And not like in a good way.

1118
01:32:13,020 --> 01:32:15,500
Yeah. Like, I'm good.

1119
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:20,380
Yeah. No. I don't, I don't want a sassy child.

1120
01:32:21,260 --> 01:32:23,900
Same with Hitman. They just like another sassy child.

1121
01:32:24,780 --> 01:32:28,380
Yeah. Like these, they look like bully sassy children too.

1122
01:32:28,380 --> 01:32:30,300
Yeah. They're just, they're just rude.

1123
01:32:31,820 --> 01:32:35,180
Snot knows kids that just like smack you and like make an

1124
01:32:35,180 --> 01:32:37,500
embarrassment of their mother in public and she's trying to like

1125
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:40,060
calm them down, but they're just like eating each other.

1126
01:32:40,060 --> 01:32:41,260
And it's like really awkward.

1127
01:32:42,700 --> 01:32:46,540
Yep. They roam, they roam in a gang of three, their third members,

1128
01:32:46,540 --> 01:32:48,380
like the next one after Hitman top.

1129
01:32:48,380 --> 01:32:48,700
Yeah.

1130
01:32:53,260 --> 01:32:57,100
With the BGL, BJLs.

1131
01:33:00,220 --> 01:33:01,980
She got them, she's very, uh,

1132
01:33:01,980 --> 01:33:10,220
a lollipop coated, but like not in a good way.

1133
01:33:13,100 --> 01:33:18,300
Like, like Tanya of the evil, but more like less duck, duck lip.

1134
01:33:20,140 --> 01:33:21,260
Yeah. Duck lips.

1135
01:33:22,940 --> 01:33:25,100
Because like, I could see the gang.

1136
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:28,060
Like it's, it's Smoochum.

1137
01:33:28,060 --> 01:33:29,260
It's Hitmon Lee.

1138
01:33:29,260 --> 01:33:33,340
It's Tyrone, Tyrone, Tyrone, Tyrone.

1139
01:33:34,700 --> 01:33:40,860
I'm just going to tell them Tyrone is Tyrone, Hitmon top and Smoochum

1140
01:33:40,860 --> 01:33:43,260
and all in a, all in a short gang.

1141
01:33:43,260 --> 01:33:46,620
And like she's the boss and they're like her two like goons.

1142
01:33:47,660 --> 01:33:52,300
Wait, is this just like the sassy evil version of the backyard he gets?

1143
01:33:53,180 --> 01:33:54,220
Is it Shaniqua?

1144
01:33:55,100 --> 01:33:56,620
Hitman top is Pablo.

1145
01:34:00,220 --> 01:34:02,780
And then Tyrone is Tyrone.

1146
01:34:05,260 --> 01:34:07,340
They just come up on you and they're dancing.

1147
01:34:07,340 --> 01:34:09,020
It's like, run me your pockets.

1148
01:34:13,340 --> 01:34:14,540
Give us your fucking wallet.

1149
01:34:15,180 --> 01:34:16,460
Give us your fucking wallet.

1150
01:34:23,180 --> 01:34:25,260
Okay, pass on Smoochum.

1151
01:34:26,220 --> 01:34:30,620
Oh, and this kid's their rival across the street.

1152
01:34:30,620 --> 01:34:34,620
Like he's a little do-getter and he's like pretending to be a little hero.

1153
01:34:34,620 --> 01:34:36,460
He's the, he's the kangaroo one.

1154
01:34:37,100 --> 01:34:38,140
I forget his name.

1155
01:34:39,820 --> 01:34:40,700
Oscar.

1156
01:34:40,700 --> 01:34:41,020
Yeah.

1157
01:34:44,620 --> 01:34:50,300
It's, I thought Oscar was like a cat or like some sort of like dog, like a jackal.

1158
01:34:50,300 --> 01:34:51,580
I thought he was a kangaroo.

1159
01:34:52,540 --> 01:34:53,180
Google in this.

1160
01:34:53,500 --> 01:34:54,620
I don't know.

1161
01:34:54,620 --> 01:34:56,940
Oscar backyard against.

1162
01:35:01,180 --> 01:35:01,740
Cause he's unique.

1163
01:35:01,740 --> 01:35:02,780
Oh, it's a unique one.

1164
01:35:02,780 --> 01:35:03,580
Not Shaniqua.

1165
01:35:04,380 --> 01:35:04,700
Yeah.

1166
01:35:06,780 --> 01:35:08,060
Oh, I'm thinking of Austin.

1167
01:35:10,300 --> 01:35:12,060
Did you say Oscar or Austin?

1168
01:35:12,780 --> 01:35:14,940
Oh, yeah, it's Austin, my bad.

1169
01:35:16,140 --> 01:35:17,580
Okay, he is a purple kangaroo.

1170
01:35:18,780 --> 01:35:20,620
He's a kangaroo?

1171
01:35:20,620 --> 01:35:20,940
Yeah.

1172
01:35:21,660 --> 01:35:23,340
He does look like a cat, actually.

1173
01:35:24,460 --> 01:35:27,900
I have always thought him to be a cat and I'm just like,

1174
01:35:30,060 --> 01:35:35,340
yeah, he does look like a cat face, but then he has like a weird, like a, like a thickums tail.

1175
01:35:37,180 --> 01:35:37,660
Yeah.

1176
01:35:37,660 --> 01:35:42,860
Like I just thought he was a weird looking cat, like, uh, like some sort of weird African cat.

1177
01:35:45,820 --> 01:35:48,140
You know, it's really funny to me because

1178
01:35:48,140 --> 01:35:51,740
I realize how unique the animal choices are for this show.

1179
01:35:51,740 --> 01:35:56,540
Cause you have a hippo, a moose, a penguin, a bug, and a kangaroo.

1180
01:35:58,780 --> 01:36:01,900
Not like a cat, a dog, a mouse or something.

1181
01:36:03,100 --> 01:36:04,860
Wait, unique was a bug?

1182
01:36:04,860 --> 01:36:06,140
I thought she was an alien.

1183
01:36:06,940 --> 01:36:07,420
Is she?

1184
01:36:07,420 --> 01:36:08,620
I don't even know.

1185
01:36:08,620 --> 01:36:09,100
Let me look.

1186
01:36:11,580 --> 01:36:12,460
Is unique?

1187
01:36:12,460 --> 01:36:13,100
Cool.

1188
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:13,260
Wait.

1189
01:36:15,420 --> 01:36:17,180
She's a unique creature.

1190
01:36:19,100 --> 01:36:26,620
Oh yeah, she's a unique creature and yeah, and also alien it says.

1191
01:36:28,060 --> 01:36:28,380
Yeah.

1192
01:36:30,300 --> 01:36:31,420
Oh, that's cool.

1193
01:36:32,220 --> 01:36:34,220
It was a self insert from the creator.

1194
01:36:36,220 --> 01:36:40,060
Oh, that's cute.

1195
01:36:40,060 --> 01:36:40,940
I like that.

1196
01:36:40,940 --> 01:36:41,580
That's funny.

1197
01:36:42,540 --> 01:36:49,900
So I'm just like looking at lore for you, Niqua.

1198
01:36:51,580 --> 01:36:53,580
Yeah, because it's interesting, right?

1199
01:36:53,580 --> 01:36:56,540
Like unique was the protagonist of the backyard against.

1200
01:36:56,540 --> 01:36:58,380
I wouldn't say she's the protagonist.

1201
01:36:58,380 --> 01:37:06,860
Well, she's definitely one of, yeah, it's like mostly, uh, her and Pablo, in my opinion.

1202
01:37:07,820 --> 01:37:09,340
Oh, here's an interesting one.

1203
01:37:09,340 --> 01:37:12,380
She is the only character who appeared in every episode.

1204
01:37:13,100 --> 01:37:15,740
Oh, so I guess maybe she is the main character.

1205
01:37:17,260 --> 01:37:19,820
Yeah, but sometimes like she doesn't have like a main role.

1206
01:37:19,820 --> 01:37:21,660
She's like, yeah, she's just a supporting.

1207
01:37:22,780 --> 01:37:23,100
Yeah.

1208
01:37:24,060 --> 01:37:25,500
I also thought she was a ladybug.

1209
01:37:26,620 --> 01:37:27,580
That's interesting.

1210
01:37:28,460 --> 01:37:31,260
Ma, ma, there's a weird cat outside.

1211
01:37:34,140 --> 01:37:36,220
It looks like grandma the fucking thing.

1212
01:37:40,300 --> 01:37:40,700
All right.

1213
01:37:40,700 --> 01:37:43,420
I'm gonna say pass on Ella kid.

1214
01:37:44,380 --> 01:37:48,140
Yeah, I don't want to get, I don't want to get into gang trouble between these two.

1215
01:37:48,140 --> 01:37:48,620
I know.

1216
01:37:48,620 --> 01:37:51,020
I don't want to like start no, no tour for.

1217
01:37:51,900 --> 01:37:52,460
Yeah.

1218
01:37:52,460 --> 01:37:56,540
And then this is the goofy friend that gets locked like caught up in their shenanigans.

1219
01:37:56,540 --> 01:37:59,580
He's like, guys, I don't think we should be doing this.

1220
01:37:59,580 --> 01:38:01,020
They're like, shut up, Magby.

1221
01:38:03,020 --> 01:38:05,260
Why don't you go home to your mother, baby?

1222
01:38:06,060 --> 01:38:09,340
He's like, but guys, I was just shut up, Magby.

1223
01:38:10,460 --> 01:38:13,500
He like tries to be the voice of reason, but he's like the friend.

1224
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:15,260
That's like, he's like the little sidekick.

1225
01:38:15,260 --> 01:38:16,780
Yeah, yeah.

1226
01:38:16,780 --> 01:38:18,780
But he's like always right.

1227
01:38:18,780 --> 01:38:19,020
Yeah.

1228
01:38:19,980 --> 01:38:24,300
I guess, I guess, I know it's going to be a bad idea guys.

1229
01:38:27,980 --> 01:38:30,140
He's the butters of the crew.

1230
01:38:30,140 --> 01:38:31,660
Better not tell Magby.

1231
01:38:32,620 --> 01:38:36,620
Magby snitches get snitches, Magby.

1232
01:38:44,380 --> 01:38:44,700
Pass.

1233
01:38:45,740 --> 01:38:46,060
Pass.

1234
01:38:48,620 --> 01:38:49,660
I love Mil-Tank.

1235
01:38:49,660 --> 01:38:50,460
Mil-Tank.

1236
01:38:50,460 --> 01:38:51,420
I'm sucking on them.

1237
01:38:51,420 --> 01:38:51,980
Utters.

1238
01:38:53,820 --> 01:38:55,740
Although black toast and tolerant, it doesn't matter.

1239
01:38:57,420 --> 01:38:59,900
Same, but like, she's cute.

1240
01:38:59,900 --> 01:39:00,380
She cute.

1241
01:39:01,820 --> 01:39:02,300
Delicious.

1242
01:39:03,420 --> 01:39:04,220
Smash.

1243
01:39:04,220 --> 01:39:04,860
Smash.

1244
01:39:07,420 --> 01:39:11,340
Lissy, I'm eating her and her child.

1245
01:39:13,260 --> 01:39:15,980
I'm smashing her and her child.

1246
01:39:17,020 --> 01:39:17,260
Wait.

1247
01:39:20,700 --> 01:39:20,940
No.

1248
01:39:22,940 --> 01:39:23,660
Trick it.

1249
01:39:23,660 --> 01:39:23,980
No.

1250
01:39:26,300 --> 01:39:28,940
It just says this video has been removed from YouTube.

1251
01:39:29,020 --> 01:39:33,100
Like, you can smash an egg, you know?

1252
01:39:34,540 --> 01:39:37,500
And crack it and just like, you know, fry it up.

1253
01:39:39,820 --> 01:39:40,060
Yeah.

1254
01:39:41,980 --> 01:39:44,060
Although, you could pop the egg in.

1255
01:39:45,900 --> 01:39:46,460
Yeah.

1256
01:39:46,460 --> 01:39:47,500
If you wanted to.

1257
01:39:48,380 --> 01:39:51,420
Experience the joy of obby position yourself.

1258
01:39:51,420 --> 01:39:51,740
Yeah.

1259
01:39:54,220 --> 01:39:54,700
Smash.

1260
01:39:55,900 --> 01:39:56,860
Okay, I'm passing.

1261
01:39:57,580 --> 01:39:58,460
I'm smashing.

1262
01:39:59,900 --> 01:40:00,460
Raiku.

1263
01:40:02,620 --> 01:40:06,220
Raiku, I have a special, I have a soft spot for it in my heart

1264
01:40:06,220 --> 01:40:08,140
because they were the first legendary I caught.

1265
01:40:09,820 --> 01:40:14,380
I, I respect you and I mean this as respectfully as possible.

1266
01:40:15,340 --> 01:40:16,540
Fuck Raiku.

1267
01:40:16,540 --> 01:40:23,580
I know, I know he looks a little odd, but I am gonna smash Raiku.

1268
01:40:24,700 --> 01:40:26,220
That's perfectly fair.

1269
01:40:26,220 --> 01:40:28,860
Just like we're childhood friends.

1270
01:40:29,820 --> 01:40:32,620
Turn to lovers, trope, you know?

1271
01:40:33,900 --> 01:40:34,860
Understandable.

1272
01:40:35,740 --> 01:40:39,660
Now, believe me when I say this for the next one.

1273
01:40:39,660 --> 01:40:40,140
Okay.

1274
01:40:40,860 --> 01:40:41,740
I'm buckling up.

1275
01:40:43,340 --> 01:40:49,500
Smash for daddy, Entei, because Pokemon the movie three really does something to you

1276
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:52,860
when you see it at the wrong informing time of your life.

1277
01:40:54,860 --> 01:40:56,460
I'll smash Entei.

1278
01:40:57,420 --> 01:41:01,820
They look like, it looks like a very wise old man that would teach me things.

1279
01:41:03,260 --> 01:41:04,540
Oh yeah, he teach you things.

1280
01:41:04,540 --> 01:41:05,020
All right.

1281
01:41:05,020 --> 01:41:05,900
Yeah, exactly.

1282
01:41:05,900 --> 01:41:06,860
Teach me a thing or two.

1283
01:41:07,580 --> 01:41:10,540
You can, you can teach an old dog new tricks, you know?

1284
01:41:10,540 --> 01:41:11,020
You know?

1285
01:41:11,580 --> 01:41:13,420
Let an old dog can teach you new tricks.

1286
01:41:13,420 --> 01:41:14,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1287
01:41:14,780 --> 01:41:15,900
Wiggles eyebrows.

1288
01:41:16,860 --> 01:41:17,740
Quicker training.

1289
01:41:21,020 --> 01:41:22,940
You know a lot about that, huh, Missy?

1290
01:41:23,820 --> 01:41:28,860
Actually, I failed, I failed out of obedience training.

1291
01:41:28,860 --> 01:41:29,580
Oh no.

1292
01:41:32,780 --> 01:41:33,820
Sweet Kune.

1293
01:41:34,860 --> 01:41:38,860
Sweet Kune has a special place in my heart because Pokemon Crystal.

1294
01:41:40,140 --> 01:41:41,580
Are you going to smash Sweet Kune?

1295
01:41:43,020 --> 01:41:44,940
No, I respect her too much.

1296
01:41:44,940 --> 01:41:47,020
Oh, well, I'm smashing Sweet Kune.

1297
01:41:48,540 --> 01:41:51,180
The only, the only one I would smash is Entei.

1298
01:41:53,900 --> 01:41:55,900
Um, Lavatar.

1299
01:41:57,420 --> 01:41:57,900
Boo!

1300
01:41:59,020 --> 01:42:00,300
Boo!

1301
01:42:00,300 --> 01:42:00,940
I hate him.

1302
01:42:00,940 --> 01:42:02,220
I hate the child.

1303
01:42:03,180 --> 01:42:03,660
Boo!

1304
01:42:03,660 --> 01:42:05,660
The sassy child pass.

1305
01:42:07,740 --> 01:42:08,540
Pupitar.

1306
01:42:10,780 --> 01:42:13,420
I mean, you know, I was thinking about it.

1307
01:42:14,780 --> 01:42:16,060
You thinking about it?

1308
01:42:16,060 --> 01:42:20,220
Because I'm thinking about like, you know, the very beginning.

1309
01:42:21,180 --> 01:42:23,020
What was that one Pokemon's name?

1310
01:42:23,740 --> 01:42:25,580
That's the Chrysalis.

1311
01:42:30,620 --> 01:42:32,860
I'm like literally blanking right now.

1312
01:42:32,860 --> 01:42:34,140
Silk, silk skin.

1313
01:42:34,140 --> 01:42:34,940
No.

1314
01:42:34,940 --> 01:42:36,380
Metapod, thank you.

1315
01:42:36,380 --> 01:42:40,700
I'm like, I'm waiting for Chats to catch up and figure it out.

1316
01:42:41,980 --> 01:42:46,940
Um, a lot of spiky bits though, like I don't see a good entry point.

1317
01:42:47,900 --> 01:42:49,500
Honestly, it's a pass for me.

1318
01:42:49,580 --> 01:42:51,740
Pupitar, I'm just gonna cancel the pass guys.

1319
01:42:55,420 --> 01:42:59,420
I don't know, it's a little too extreme for a bad dragon, don't you think?

1320
01:42:59,420 --> 01:43:02,780
Yeah, I feel like the Pine Co is a little bit different.

1321
01:43:02,780 --> 01:43:04,220
This is just like sharp.

1322
01:43:05,260 --> 01:43:05,740
Yeah.

1323
01:43:05,740 --> 01:43:06,540
I'm a pass.

1324
01:43:08,860 --> 01:43:09,740
Tyrannotar.

1325
01:43:10,700 --> 01:43:13,740
Now, if you have like Godzilla finish, this is the guy you.

1326
01:43:13,740 --> 01:43:16,700
Yup, we're smashing Tyrannotar.

1327
01:43:17,100 --> 01:43:18,940
Murr smashing Tyrannotar.

1328
01:43:19,820 --> 01:43:20,620
Hell yeah.

1329
01:43:20,620 --> 01:43:23,820
Not the mega though, because I don't really like what's going on there.

1330
01:43:23,820 --> 01:43:24,860
That just looks weird.

1331
01:43:25,580 --> 01:43:29,740
He looks like he's evolved into like a castle that I could just walk through.

1332
01:43:30,380 --> 01:43:32,620
Like his legs look like little windows.

1333
01:43:32,620 --> 01:43:33,020
Oh yeah.

1334
01:43:33,740 --> 01:43:40,060
Finding the fire is like, ah yes, time to go home to my beautiful Tyrannotar.

1335
01:43:41,340 --> 01:43:46,460
He looks like a tree that just like grew very oddly and then it's

1336
01:43:46,460 --> 01:43:49,580
branches fell off and got hit with some sort of blight.

1337
01:43:50,460 --> 01:43:50,620
Pass.

1338
01:43:50,620 --> 01:43:51,580
I don't like that.

1339
01:43:51,580 --> 01:43:51,980
Pass.

1340
01:43:52,860 --> 01:43:53,340
Lugia.

1341
01:43:53,340 --> 01:43:53,660
Smash.

1342
01:43:54,380 --> 01:43:55,020
Smash.

1343
01:43:55,020 --> 01:43:55,980
Smash.

1344
01:43:55,980 --> 01:43:57,020
Smack my cheeks.

1345
01:43:57,900 --> 01:44:01,340
Did you ever, did you like Pokemon 2000?

1346
01:44:02,140 --> 01:44:07,900
I never really, I'll be honest, I never really watched any of the Pokemon TV show or the movies.

1347
01:44:07,900 --> 01:44:08,700
I've only played the games.

1348
01:44:08,700 --> 01:44:09,660
Really?

1349
01:44:09,660 --> 01:44:10,460
Yeah.

1350
01:44:10,460 --> 01:44:15,820
I played my games in secret because growing up I was told that Pokemon was demonic because

1351
01:44:15,820 --> 01:44:20,540
they're based on spirits and shinto religion.

1352
01:44:22,300 --> 01:44:24,780
It's like pocket monsters, pocket demons.

1353
01:44:24,780 --> 01:44:28,460
I remember sitting in church and they did a whole thing on that and then I stole this

1354
01:44:28,460 --> 01:44:33,900
kid's fire red just so I could play Pokemon because I really wanted to play it.

1355
01:44:35,500 --> 01:44:35,820
Man.

1356
01:44:36,700 --> 01:44:37,340
What?

1357
01:44:37,340 --> 01:44:40,380
Man, I also have religious trauma.

1358
01:44:40,860 --> 01:44:51,020
But like I was fortunate enough for not to be a part of the Pokemon band but I was a part of the,

1359
01:44:51,020 --> 01:44:53,660
you can't watch Hercules because that has other gods in it.

1360
01:44:53,660 --> 01:44:55,100
Yep, same.

1361
01:44:55,100 --> 01:44:55,900
Yep, that too.

1362
01:44:56,700 --> 01:45:02,060
But then like you had other kids in your church who all who got to see it and you're just super

1363
01:45:02,060 --> 01:45:05,580
mad and resentful and like why the fuck did they get to watch it and not me?

1364
01:45:06,140 --> 01:45:06,460
Facts.

1365
01:45:07,180 --> 01:45:08,060
I'm not a poser.

1366
01:45:08,060 --> 01:45:10,300
I never said I was a huge Pokemon fan, people.

1367
01:45:10,300 --> 01:45:14,060
I don't know what gave you that idea.

1368
01:45:14,060 --> 01:45:17,100
I've just played a couple of the games that I love.

1369
01:45:17,100 --> 01:45:17,980
They're really nice.

1370
01:45:17,980 --> 01:45:19,420
I love them but I don't know too much.

1371
01:45:24,380 --> 01:45:25,900
But yeah, Lugia is a smash.

1372
01:45:25,900 --> 01:45:26,220
Yep.

1373
01:45:27,260 --> 01:45:28,540
I like Lugia.

1374
01:45:29,820 --> 01:45:33,580
Ho-oh is a ho-ho and can be gone.

1375
01:45:33,580 --> 01:45:34,060
I know.

1376
01:45:34,060 --> 01:45:39,100
I remember getting ho-oh in HeartGold and I was like, I don't like this thing.

1377
01:45:41,340 --> 01:45:43,260
And I wish that I had gotten a soul silver.

1378
01:45:47,500 --> 01:45:48,860
Uh, Celebi.

1379
01:45:52,300 --> 01:45:53,420
That's an onion.

1380
01:45:53,420 --> 01:45:58,780
I'm, that's why I was gonna say I'm gonna chop up this onion, put it in a stew,

1381
01:45:59,820 --> 01:46:01,900
use the green parts as garnish.

1382
01:46:02,140 --> 01:46:04,140
Yep.

1383
01:46:04,140 --> 01:46:07,740
Do you think like after you cook down Celebi and you like eat it,

1384
01:46:07,740 --> 01:46:12,300
it's like magic lemonade rules where it still grants your wish once you've eaten it?

1385
01:46:12,860 --> 01:46:13,980
I feel like it.

1386
01:46:13,980 --> 01:46:17,820
I feel like if you like sip it, yeah, you like something happens

1387
01:46:17,820 --> 01:46:20,860
because you're just condensing all that power into food so you could like

1388
01:46:21,580 --> 01:46:24,700
store parts of Celebi for later to grant your wishes.

1389
01:46:25,340 --> 01:46:27,020
Yeah, like Celebi jerky.

1390
01:46:27,020 --> 01:46:27,340
Yeah.

1391
01:46:28,220 --> 01:46:29,500
Like you need a miracle.

1392
01:46:30,460 --> 01:46:37,020
You're like, oh, I mean like pop into the fridge, have a piece of Celebi jerky, and there you go.

1393
01:46:38,620 --> 01:46:39,660
Your wishes come true.

1394
01:46:40,540 --> 01:46:41,820
Yeah, yeah.

1395
01:46:42,780 --> 01:46:43,180
Pass.

1396
01:46:43,820 --> 01:46:44,860
Trico, pass.

1397
01:46:45,980 --> 01:46:46,620
Pass.

1398
01:46:46,620 --> 01:46:47,340
Pass.

1399
01:46:47,340 --> 01:46:47,900
Grovile.

1400
01:46:52,460 --> 01:46:58,060
I like the smug expression, but I don't know.

1401
01:46:59,020 --> 01:46:59,820
I mean.

1402
01:46:59,820 --> 01:47:01,180
He looks like he smokes weed.

1403
01:47:02,140 --> 01:47:06,140
He does look, he looks like he, yeah, he does look like he smokes weed actually.

1404
01:47:07,900 --> 01:47:11,660
He also looks like a bit of a bully, like he would shove you into a locker.

1405
01:47:11,660 --> 01:47:14,220
Yeah, like he was like the bully stoner.

1406
01:47:15,100 --> 01:47:15,420
Yeah.

1407
01:47:17,340 --> 01:47:18,940
Like, hey, you want to smoke some pot?

1408
01:47:19,820 --> 01:47:20,540
You're like, no.

1409
01:47:21,580 --> 01:47:26,300
Wow, you, you narc, are you going to tell him me then just like slams you into a locker?

1410
01:47:28,460 --> 01:47:29,580
Yeah, I'm a pass.

1411
01:47:30,620 --> 01:47:32,060
Can I get like five bucks?

1412
01:47:32,060 --> 01:47:34,140
He says to you in that sort of rasp.

1413
01:47:35,420 --> 01:47:36,060
Cool thing.

1414
01:47:37,020 --> 01:47:38,460
He has a dime bag.

1415
01:47:38,460 --> 01:47:40,380
Don't use it all in one place.

1416
01:47:40,380 --> 01:47:41,980
And you're like, I didn't ask for this.

1417
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:49,020
You're like, I just wanted to help with like, if you knew what the math homework was that he's like,

1418
01:47:49,900 --> 01:47:57,100
oh, uh, later and then just like leaves and he actually gives you like a bag of oregano or something.

1419
01:47:58,060 --> 01:47:58,380
Yeah.

1420
01:48:01,900 --> 01:48:05,260
Oh man, reptile looks like he's grown up.

1421
01:48:05,260 --> 01:48:06,780
He went to college and dropped out.

1422
01:48:08,700 --> 01:48:13,660
Like the little under eye, like the red eyeliner, it looks again, like he's a stoner.

1423
01:48:14,620 --> 01:48:18,620
He started, he like tried to do his own dispensary, but it like fell through.

1424
01:48:19,580 --> 01:48:22,860
Like, oh my God, dude, I haven't seen you since high school.

1425
01:48:22,860 --> 01:48:23,580
How you been?

1426
01:48:24,540 --> 01:48:28,220
And he has like preconceived notions that you guys are friends,

1427
01:48:28,220 --> 01:48:30,460
but you're just remembered, like how much they bullied you.

1428
01:48:32,060 --> 01:48:32,380
Sorry.

1429
01:48:38,220 --> 01:48:43,580
Honestly, I feel like he'd be like, hey, can I like crash on your couch?

1430
01:48:43,580 --> 01:48:45,500
We were besties in high school after all.

1431
01:48:46,380 --> 01:48:50,620
Remember that one time I like gave you a dime bag for five dollars?

1432
01:48:51,580 --> 01:48:53,180
It was like, that was what I could know.

1433
01:48:54,940 --> 01:48:58,140
Yeah, but I guess you season some pretty good fucking pasta with it.

1434
01:49:01,980 --> 01:49:04,780
You're like, I turned it into a win so I guess you could stay over.

1435
01:49:07,100 --> 01:49:09,900
Enemies to lovers, Wattpad right there.

1436
01:49:12,380 --> 01:49:14,860
All right, I'm passing on reptile though.

1437
01:49:15,980 --> 01:49:20,060
I'm smashing because like we've written this fantasy though and I'm just like,

1438
01:49:20,780 --> 01:49:22,460
you're like, I can fix him.

1439
01:49:22,460 --> 01:49:23,100
I can help.

1440
01:49:24,220 --> 01:49:27,820
My my reptile boyfriend keeps smoking pot.

1441
01:49:28,860 --> 01:49:29,660
Greeting out.

1442
01:49:29,660 --> 01:49:36,460
Babe, stop, stop smoking pot and get a job, please.

1443
01:49:37,020 --> 01:49:39,500
Stop saying you're going to grow a new thing.

1444
01:49:40,700 --> 01:49:42,060
It's a new strain.

1445
01:49:43,020 --> 01:49:48,940
Babe, I'm telling you, once my streaming career takes off, you won't have to work anymore.

1446
01:49:49,020 --> 01:49:50,140
He's just playing like

1447
01:49:56,140 --> 01:49:59,740
Team Fortress only or like Counter Strike.

1448
01:49:59,740 --> 01:50:00,460
Oh my god.

1449
01:50:02,620 --> 01:50:03,420
Oh my god.

1450
01:50:06,780 --> 01:50:08,380
Oh, the mega version.

1451
01:50:08,380 --> 01:50:11,580
This is where this is where it turns into like Avril Lavigne's.

1452
01:50:12,380 --> 01:50:13,420
He was a boy.

1453
01:50:13,420 --> 01:50:15,820
She was a girl that he like he becomes the rock star.

1454
01:50:15,820 --> 01:50:17,340
Like this is when he becomes successful.

1455
01:50:18,300 --> 01:50:21,020
And he leaves you behind and he's also a Christmas tree.

1456
01:50:21,900 --> 01:50:23,260
Oh, so like Skippy.

1457
01:50:23,900 --> 01:50:24,220
Yeah.

1458
01:50:25,980 --> 01:50:27,340
Damn, I can fix him.

1459
01:50:31,580 --> 01:50:32,700
I'm passing again.

1460
01:50:32,700 --> 01:50:34,700
I can't get all the freaking Christmas tree.

1461
01:50:36,060 --> 01:50:38,460
This is a that's a chicken nugget.

1462
01:50:41,420 --> 01:50:42,540
That's a chicken nugget.

1463
01:50:43,980 --> 01:50:47,260
Well, because it is that's a one by chicken.

1464
01:50:47,580 --> 01:50:49,020
Yeah, I've I've eaten that.

1465
01:50:51,340 --> 01:50:53,980
Like it's it's probably already cooked.

1466
01:50:53,980 --> 01:50:55,180
You just got to kill it.

1467
01:50:57,660 --> 01:51:01,740
You kill it and then just like cooks itself to perfection as it dies.

1468
01:51:02,860 --> 01:51:03,100
Yeah.

1469
01:51:06,140 --> 01:51:06,860
What hug?

1470
01:51:06,860 --> 01:51:07,820
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1471
01:51:07,820 --> 01:51:08,700
I'm overeating this.

1472
01:51:12,860 --> 01:51:14,140
Uh, come buskin.

1473
01:51:14,140 --> 01:51:17,500
Busket down.

1474
01:51:19,420 --> 01:51:21,660
Busket down Satyana.

1475
01:51:21,660 --> 01:51:26,540
Um, I'm going to make that chicken wings like those chicken thighs.

1476
01:51:26,540 --> 01:51:27,020
They're mine.

1477
01:51:27,020 --> 01:51:30,700
This is turning into a it's a bucket of chicken.

1478
01:51:30,700 --> 01:51:32,620
Yeah, that's a KFC bucket right there.

1479
01:51:33,500 --> 01:51:37,020
I'm in a KFC in like five years.

1480
01:51:38,940 --> 01:51:40,700
I don't think it's a KFC nearby.

1481
01:51:40,700 --> 01:51:42,620
Oh, man.

1482
01:51:42,620 --> 01:51:43,740
Pass by eating.

1483
01:51:43,740 --> 01:51:43,980
Yeah.

1484
01:51:43,980 --> 01:51:44,700
Pass by eat.

1485
01:51:46,220 --> 01:51:46,540
Okay.

1486
01:51:46,540 --> 01:51:47,740
But however.

1487
01:51:48,780 --> 01:51:49,100
Yeah.

1488
01:51:49,100 --> 01:51:53,180
A blaze blaze a can blaze a can can blaze my can.

1489
01:51:53,180 --> 01:51:54,300
That's all I'm going to say.

1490
01:51:55,020 --> 01:51:58,300
I mean, they're not even they're not even trying to hide that.

1491
01:51:58,300 --> 01:51:59,900
He's got a big dick energy.

1492
01:51:59,900 --> 01:52:01,180
I know right there.

1493
01:52:01,180 --> 01:52:02,140
It's right there.

1494
01:52:02,860 --> 01:52:04,300
It's right there.

1495
01:52:04,300 --> 01:52:07,900
And you know, like a little bit of that like the fuzzy moment,

1496
01:52:07,900 --> 01:52:11,500
like I kind of it's it's very real.

1497
01:52:11,500 --> 01:52:13,260
Like he's just like, I don't shave.

1498
01:52:13,260 --> 01:52:15,020
And you're like, oh, okay.

1499
01:52:15,020 --> 01:52:15,820
I'm into that.

1500
01:52:18,860 --> 01:52:20,060
Can I like braid your hair?

1501
01:52:21,660 --> 01:52:23,660
You like part as a hair feathers.

1502
01:52:23,660 --> 01:52:24,460
I don't even know.

1503
01:52:24,460 --> 01:52:25,500
It's probably feathers.

1504
01:52:25,500 --> 01:52:29,180
You just like part the feathers and that's like a cloaca.

1505
01:52:32,940 --> 01:52:33,420
Well, yeah.

1506
01:52:33,420 --> 01:52:36,620
But like once you get past the cloaca, like they're sure to be

1507
01:52:36,620 --> 01:52:44,540
like a thing that kind of goes or I guess that but we can we can scissor.

1508
01:52:46,300 --> 01:52:47,260
Yeah.

1509
01:52:47,260 --> 01:52:49,900
And then like once once you find out that it's a boy,

1510
01:52:49,900 --> 01:52:53,660
the insertion happens like like the face hugger deal.

1511
01:52:54,700 --> 01:52:55,500
Oh my god.

1512
01:52:59,580 --> 01:53:00,060
All right.

1513
01:53:00,060 --> 01:53:06,060
Smash the mega version.

1514
01:53:06,940 --> 01:53:08,220
The mega version is hot.

1515
01:53:08,220 --> 01:53:08,540
Yeah.

1516
01:53:09,820 --> 01:53:11,420
Again, same same thing.

1517
01:53:12,380 --> 01:53:14,860
He's like he's like a he's like the skinnier version.

1518
01:53:16,300 --> 01:53:17,180
He's like the skinny.

1519
01:53:17,180 --> 01:53:22,460
You know how like the skinny dudes, you know, surprise you, they pack a wallop.

1520
01:53:24,540 --> 01:53:26,060
Oh, he's packing something.

1521
01:53:26,060 --> 01:53:27,020
He's packing heat.

1522
01:53:30,540 --> 01:53:31,500
The real question.

1523
01:53:31,500 --> 01:53:32,940
Does it bloop or swing?

1524
01:53:33,820 --> 01:53:34,300
Bloop.

1525
01:53:38,780 --> 01:53:41,340
Another question to start asking from this point on.

1526
01:53:41,900 --> 01:53:45,340
Do you think those are that's like flames coming out of his hands or could those be

1527
01:53:45,340 --> 01:53:47,500
taken off as like wraps and he can tie you up?

1528
01:53:48,220 --> 01:53:51,500
I think they're like flames that he can turn on with the snap of a finger.

1529
01:53:51,500 --> 01:53:53,980
Like he just sort of activates them before a fight.

1530
01:53:53,980 --> 01:53:54,780
That's cool.

1531
01:53:54,780 --> 01:53:55,260
All right.

1532
01:53:55,260 --> 01:53:56,860
I like the I like the dazzle.

1533
01:53:56,860 --> 01:54:00,060
I like the it's showing off.

1534
01:54:00,060 --> 01:54:01,100
Yeah, the pageantry.

1535
01:54:01,100 --> 01:54:08,140
That's a baby.

1536
01:54:10,780 --> 01:54:12,220
I'm cherishing this baby.

1537
01:54:13,020 --> 01:54:14,380
My kid is so cute.

1538
01:54:14,380 --> 01:54:15,580
I love my kids.

1539
01:54:17,500 --> 01:54:18,860
I heard you like my kids.

1540
01:54:18,860 --> 01:54:19,740
Yeah, you dams.

1541
01:54:19,740 --> 01:54:20,060
Right.

1542
01:54:20,060 --> 01:54:21,420
I like my kids.

1543
01:54:21,420 --> 01:54:22,860
My kid was adorable.

1544
01:54:24,460 --> 01:54:25,740
Do you like my kids?

1545
01:54:25,740 --> 01:54:26,140
Yeah.

1546
01:54:26,140 --> 01:54:27,820
I like my kids.

1547
01:54:28,060 --> 01:54:31,900
I can't even remember how that song goes.

1548
01:54:31,900 --> 01:54:33,100
I haven't heard that so long.

1549
01:54:33,100 --> 01:54:33,740
Oh my God.

1550
01:54:34,540 --> 01:54:36,460
It's a do you like waffles?

1551
01:54:36,460 --> 01:54:37,740
Yeah, we like waffles.

1552
01:54:37,740 --> 01:54:39,020
Do you like french toast?

1553
01:54:39,020 --> 01:54:40,380
Yeah, we like french toast.

1554
01:54:41,340 --> 01:54:42,540
Do you like pancakes?

1555
01:54:42,540 --> 01:54:43,900
Yeah, we like pancakes.

1556
01:54:43,900 --> 01:54:44,620
Dude, dude.

1557
01:54:44,620 --> 01:54:44,940
Dude, dude.

1558
01:54:44,940 --> 01:54:45,900
Can't wait to get a mouthful.

1559
01:54:45,900 --> 01:54:47,020
Can't wait to get a mouthful.

1560
01:54:47,020 --> 01:54:48,300
Waffles.

1561
01:54:48,300 --> 01:54:49,340
Oh my God.

1562
01:54:49,340 --> 01:54:50,220
Holy crap.

1563
01:54:50,860 --> 01:54:58,860
Passing on the like it.

1564
01:54:58,860 --> 01:55:00,220
Passing on the like it.

1565
01:55:00,220 --> 01:55:02,700
Would give them waffles, though, as a treat.

1566
01:55:03,740 --> 01:55:06,860
Marsh top also would pass,

1567
01:55:06,860 --> 01:55:08,620
but give some waffles as a treat.

1568
01:55:08,620 --> 01:55:11,900
Maybe pancakes or french toast, whatever they prefer.

1569
01:55:11,900 --> 01:55:13,260
I'll give them a little breakfast buffet.

1570
01:55:14,300 --> 01:55:16,780
Swampert is in that ready to go position.

1571
01:55:17,740 --> 01:55:18,700
Honestly.

1572
01:55:20,380 --> 01:55:23,340
Swampert like he's ready to go.

1573
01:55:23,340 --> 01:55:25,180
He's got he's got the form.

1574
01:55:26,220 --> 01:55:27,260
Bella Hadid.

1575
01:55:27,260 --> 01:55:29,100
Homie can get it, you know.

1576
01:55:29,100 --> 01:55:29,980
Oh, yeah.

1577
01:55:31,660 --> 01:55:32,380
He can get it.

1578
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:35,020
Shape of water.

1579
01:55:35,020 --> 01:55:36,380
Oh, I just heard thunder.

1580
01:55:36,380 --> 01:55:37,980
My sky is yellow outside.

1581
01:55:39,180 --> 01:55:42,060
Oh, maybe we should wrap it up soon.

1582
01:55:42,780 --> 01:55:43,260
Oh, yeah.

1583
01:55:44,060 --> 01:55:44,940
Do you want to end on?

1584
01:55:44,940 --> 01:55:45,980
Do you want to end on actually like

1585
01:55:45,980 --> 01:55:46,700
swampert?

1586
01:55:46,700 --> 01:55:48,060
I regret I have another.

1587
01:55:48,060 --> 01:55:50,940
I have a blue website stream I need to prepare for.

1588
01:55:51,900 --> 01:55:55,500
Yeah, we can end on here because it's the perfect smash.

1589
01:55:55,500 --> 01:55:56,460
Perfect smash.

1590
01:55:57,020 --> 01:55:57,580
Swampert.

1591
01:55:59,180 --> 01:56:01,820
And then next time next time we'll get through the 40.

1592
01:56:02,700 --> 01:56:03,020
Yeah.

1593
01:56:04,220 --> 01:56:06,380
Unless you want to speed run the 40.

1594
01:56:09,100 --> 01:56:09,660
Oh, man.

1595
01:56:09,660 --> 01:56:11,020
But the commentary is like the best.

1596
01:56:11,020 --> 01:56:11,420
I know.

1597
01:56:11,420 --> 01:56:11,660
Yeah.

1598
01:56:11,660 --> 01:56:12,060
All right.

1599
01:56:12,060 --> 01:56:15,020
I'm looking at Puccino like I know what's next.

1600
01:56:16,220 --> 01:56:20,540
Now why'd you go on and spoil it for me?

1601
01:56:20,540 --> 01:56:21,900
I was going to be surprised.

1602
01:56:28,700 --> 01:56:33,500
Because unlike Houndower and Houndoom,

1603
01:56:35,100 --> 01:56:38,380
both Puccina and Mighty Anna can get it.

1604
01:56:38,380 --> 01:56:41,500
But like that's a conversation for next time.

1605
01:56:43,020 --> 01:56:44,700
In the next episode.

1606
01:56:46,060 --> 01:56:49,580
And like I'm not wrong.

1607
01:56:49,580 --> 01:56:50,620
They both can get it.

1608
01:56:50,620 --> 01:56:51,980
They're both hot.

1609
01:56:51,980 --> 01:56:54,220
I will never confirm nor deny.

1610
01:56:55,980 --> 01:56:56,700
That's okay.

1611
01:56:56,700 --> 01:56:57,980
I'll confirm it.

1612
01:56:57,980 --> 01:57:00,060
And like they only speak in facts.

1613
01:57:00,060 --> 01:57:00,540
They're hot.

1614
01:57:01,500 --> 01:57:02,060
Hot dog.

1615
01:57:05,980 --> 01:57:06,300
Okay.

1616
01:57:07,020 --> 01:57:11,740
On that note, thank you guys for coming to stream.

1617
01:57:11,740 --> 01:57:15,660
I hope you guys enjoyed the smash or pass.

1618
01:57:16,460 --> 01:57:18,380
Let me find someone to raid.

1619
01:57:19,500 --> 01:57:21,580
Do you have any words you want to say?

1620
01:57:21,580 --> 01:57:22,940
Trinket, please check out Trinket.

1621
01:57:22,940 --> 01:57:24,940
Her stuff is in my description by the way.

01:57:24,940 --> 01:57:30,700
Please go to her Twitch channel and follow and subscribe.

1623
01:57:32,060 --> 01:57:33,500
Parting words of wisdom.

1624
01:57:33,500 --> 01:57:36,300
Always read your terms and conditions.

1625
01:57:36,940 --> 01:57:41,900
And never drink orange juice after brushing your teeth.

1626
01:57:41,900 --> 01:57:42,140
Yes.

1627
01:57:43,020 --> 01:57:44,940
Oh my god.

1628
01:57:44,940 --> 01:57:46,620
Thank you for the words of wisdom.

1629
01:57:48,140 --> 01:57:49,020
Anytime.

1630
01:57:52,300 --> 01:57:54,140
I was going to do something and I already forgot.

1631
01:57:56,220 --> 01:57:58,780
It was you're going to look for somebody to raid.

1632
01:57:58,780 --> 01:57:59,500
Oh, that's it.

1633
01:57:59,500 --> 01:57:59,900
Thank you.

1634
01:58:02,540 --> 01:58:05,100
Again, I'm very forgetful.

1635
01:58:06,700 --> 01:58:11,980
You are also going to tell Herum your next plan.

1636
01:58:12,860 --> 01:58:14,060
My next plans.

1637
01:58:14,060 --> 01:58:15,340
Oh, what for the stream?

1638
01:58:16,380 --> 01:58:20,620
Yeah, honestly, I don't really know because I've never

1639
01:58:22,140 --> 01:58:24,300
Wait, which stream for blue website?

1640
01:58:25,100 --> 01:58:25,740
I don't know.

1641
01:58:27,980 --> 01:58:30,940
For blue website, I've never used blue website before.

1642
01:58:30,940 --> 01:58:33,260
And I saw someone ask if it was going to be pay walled.

1643
01:58:36,060 --> 01:58:38,380
I don't think so.

1644
01:58:39,340 --> 01:58:41,580
I think I'll keep it free.

1645
01:58:42,140 --> 01:58:52,940
And then maybe have some another unique.

1646
01:58:52,940 --> 01:58:54,540
I'll bring a sacrament with me.

1647
01:58:57,340 --> 01:59:00,220
I'll bring a pink sacrament with me, perhaps.

1648
01:59:01,660 --> 01:59:03,020
Because pink is my favorite color.

1649
01:59:05,020 --> 01:59:07,180
But let me find someone to raid.

1650
01:59:07,980 --> 01:59:08,460
That'll be.

1651
01:59:10,860 --> 01:59:11,500
Yeah.

1652
01:59:11,500 --> 01:59:11,980
Wait, what?

1653
01:59:12,140 --> 01:59:12,620
What did you say?

1654
01:59:13,340 --> 01:59:16,060
Oh, maybe I'll get my nails painted pink this weekend.

1655
01:59:16,060 --> 01:59:17,740
Oh, I'll match you.

1656
01:59:17,740 --> 01:59:19,180
I'll get my nails done and match you.

1657
01:59:24,460 --> 01:59:24,780
Okay.

1658
01:59:25,660 --> 01:59:28,140
I'm also distracted because it just started pouring outside.

1659
01:59:29,420 --> 01:59:30,300
Holy crap.

1660
01:59:30,300 --> 01:59:31,420
Um, let's see.

1661
01:59:34,300 --> 01:59:34,860
Oh, gosh.

1662
01:59:38,140 --> 01:59:38,620
Excuse me.

1663
01:59:39,420 --> 01:59:42,220
Rating on YouTube is so hard.

1664
01:59:46,780 --> 01:59:49,020
Uh, I'm going to rate.

1665
01:59:49,020 --> 01:59:51,580
Oh, uh, Maeve is playing Dark Souls.

1666
01:59:52,620 --> 01:59:56,940
Very, uh, apt because I was playing, um, Eldering yesterday.

1667
01:59:56,940 --> 01:59:59,340
So go us.

1668
01:59:59,340 --> 02:00:03,820
Tell me hello and have a great time, guys.

1669
02:00:04,780 --> 02:00:07,260
We'll see you next time.

1670
02:00:07,260 --> 02:00:11,020
Emerald launch into Poochina.

1671
02:00:14,060 --> 02:00:15,660
Bye.

1672
02:00:18,700 --> 02:00:19,900
Can't find my OBS.

1673
02:00:19,900 --> 02:00:20,780
Oh, there it is.

1674
02:00:22,300 --> 02:00:23,020
There we go.

1675
02:00:25,020 --> 02:00:26,220
Bye, harem.

1676
02:00:26,220 --> 02:00:27,420
Bye.

1677
02:00:27,420 --> 02:00:27,820
Bye.

1678
02:00:30,940 --> 02:00:31,580
Stinky.

1679
02:00:37,260 --> 02:00:49,820
Wait a second.

1680
02:00:49,820 --> 02:00:50,780
Thank you for the super.

1681
02:00:53,340 --> 02:00:54,860
Thank you, Jay reads.

1682
02:00:54,860 --> 02:00:57,020
I just want to say you guys are extremely funny and hilarious.

1683
02:00:57,020 --> 02:01:03,660
I know you do blah, blah content, but I do like my, my, my sub for that word.

1684
02:01:04,220 --> 02:01:05,820
But honestly, these streams from you are my favorite.

1685
02:01:05,820 --> 02:01:07,980
You and Trinket have great dynamic and are unhinged.

1686
02:01:07,980 --> 02:01:09,340
The best way is your combos.

1687
02:01:09,340 --> 02:01:10,380
Please keep it up.

1688
02:01:11,020 --> 02:01:12,540
We always keep it real.

1689
02:01:12,540 --> 02:01:14,140
We always keep it unhinged.

1690
02:01:14,140 --> 02:01:14,540
Thank you.

1691
02:01:18,380 --> 02:01:20,780
You have to have friends who can match my freak.

1692
02:01:20,780 --> 02:01:21,180
Yeah.

1693
02:01:21,180 --> 02:01:25,340
I mean, she, we, she, I can barely match her freak sometimes.

1694
02:01:27,500 --> 02:01:34,620
And I'm, I'm the one in the, the, the fun company, the, I'm trying to be say so.

1695
02:01:34,620 --> 02:01:39,340
I'm going to say so none in my, you're, you're, you're in the horpo.

1696
02:01:39,340 --> 02:01:39,740
I'll say it.

1697
02:01:42,860 --> 02:01:45,820
It's so, it's a matter that YouTube transcript is going to pick it up.

1698
02:01:47,980 --> 02:01:49,740
I'm going to keep getting limited.

1699
02:01:49,740 --> 02:01:50,780
No, it doesn't really matter.

1700
02:01:50,780 --> 02:01:52,300
Um, anyways, bye guys.

1701
02:01:53,820 --> 02:01:54,300
