Like that was the most terrible thing you could ever say to make fun of British people and it gave me a chuckle

05:32.640 --> 05:36.120
How do we know you're not secretly an Android you don't I

05:37.120 --> 05:41.840

05:49.040 --> 05:53.520
Okay, so I have a noise gate and I have a compressor and

05:54.240 --> 05:56.240
I have some other filters here

05:56.240 --> 05:58.740
But I feel like they tend to

05:59.680 --> 06:03.000
Mess up my voice in terms of when I scream it

06:03.520 --> 06:09.320
Kind of just blocks me out, so I took off the the noise suppression one

Somebody flog him you can choose amongst yourselves who gets the privilege to beat that guy. So go ahead

08:45.320 --> 08:50.160
Did you ever Dom Queen? I didn't Dom Queen so in my

08:51.080 --> 08:53.080
early

08:53.360 --> 08:55.360
Adolescence that's fucked

08:55.440 --> 09:02.640
In our early time together. I was very submissive. I actually you can even say I keep these ropes on as

09:03.080 --> 09:05.560
That homage to her, you know

09:06.480 --> 09:09.960
She did teach me about doming, but I didn't dom her I

09:10.840 --> 09:12.840
Did not dom her Lord dump

09:13.160 --> 09:19.360
Um, it's crazy because I'm making this up for the spot. So I'm happy you guys are cool with that. I

09:20.080 --> 09:23.480
Say we take turns at flogging. I agree with that not

09:24.320 --> 09:26.320
Not the blind cane

09:27.560 --> 09:29.560
Even with the blind cane

09:30.360 --> 09:32.360
Okay, um, so yeah

09:32.760 --> 09:34.760

09:35.160 --> 09:40.080
So I'm gonna fiddle around with my settings real quick. So

09:43.600 --> 09:48.360
You can hear my fan because I have a fan for my phone for when I stream

09:49.520 --> 09:53.540
So it doesn't overheat and then naturally my computer has a fan

09:53.920 --> 09:58.800
So you might be hearing the fans and you might also be hearing my AC. Can we jump them?

09:58.800 --> 10:03.680
Of course, you can jump them. Wait, did your beauty mark switch size? No, I'm mirrored and I can't un-mirror myself

10:04.560 --> 10:06.560
It like won't let me

10:07.240 --> 10:13.200
Flip myself for some reason like I'm trying desperately to flip

10:13.880 --> 10:15.600

10:15.600 --> 10:17.600

10:19.280 --> 10:21.280
If I flip vertical oh

10:21.720 --> 10:25.800

All right, harem oh

27:06.880 --> 27:08.880
Crap

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
No, I looked at the viewer count

27:13.720 --> 27:15.720
as I opened the tab

27:16.600 --> 27:18.600
We were count jump scare

27:21.040 --> 27:24.680
So that's you you look so again as

27:25.680 --> 27:32.840
People may not know I didn't hot I did not design the mascot. I did not design she be I was hired on to play

27:33.800 --> 27:39.000
Myself although I am who I am I was meant to be I was meant to be she be my entire life

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
You know then week before I or

27:42.080 --> 27:44.080
Yeah, like the week before I

27:44.080 --> 27:51.760
Streamed like I did debut I saw rabbits every day outside my apartment never before I'm like the universe is telling me

27:51.800 --> 27:57.360
I'm meant to be a bunny girl, or I meant to be a playboy bunny which one um

27:58.360 --> 28:06.080
But I the moment I saw this I was like this looks like like tuxedo mask or a persona character

28:06.080 --> 28:08.920
And I like it a lot. I think it's cute

28:09.880 --> 28:13.400
Use of the harem and you know what I was like I'm like, oh

28:13.840 --> 28:15.680
You can change your hat

28:15.680 --> 28:21.560
You can change the type of ropes you're wearing if you don't want to have a scarf on because I also like I

28:21.760 --> 28:28.000
Know I do have female viewers you can feminize this you can do like a more feminine mask or like a

28:28.440 --> 28:32.560
More feminine hat, so I just I want you to be able to you know

28:33.120 --> 28:39.480
Mix and match, but that's that's you got you guys look a little mafia bosses. It's a rabbit Junkler for

28:40.680 --> 28:41.920
I

28:41.920 --> 28:45.840
Can't think about persona five. I've actually never played persona five don't come at me

28:46.840 --> 28:48.160
so

28:48.160 --> 28:52.600
But I was trying to think of like some sort of goofy little thing

28:53.720 --> 28:57.240
She'd be representing the 3% female audience so out of curiosity

28:57.240 --> 29:02.120
I was looking to like edit like a description one of the videos because I had like done a typo and

29:04.600 --> 29:06.600
What I

29:07.640 --> 29:11.920
Accidentally ended up doing was seeing the demographic for

29:12.480 --> 29:14.480
Um

29:14.800 --> 29:19.320
Who watches my content and it was 99% men and

29:20.440 --> 29:23.840
1% women so shout out to those ladies out there

29:24.760 --> 29:26.760

29:43.680 --> 29:45.680
You women

29:45.880 --> 29:47.880
Don't say that

29:47.920 --> 29:53.040
You two was just even massive sausage party, you know, it's weird. I don't like I feel like it would be the opposite

29:53.440 --> 29:57.760
Like I'm sorry. I thought you the bros it all be on like reddit or

29:58.600 --> 30:00.600

30:01.600 --> 30:06.480
Lady kumar, but I'm not full kumar all the time am I kumar right now?

30:07.040 --> 30:10.280

30:10.280 --> 30:14.640
My titties are massive and I'm wearing bondage clothing and I have a ball gag as a choker

30:14.640 --> 30:20.360
But that's besides the point. This is girl talk. Okay. This is she be talk

30:20.880 --> 30:23.320
You were a few hours ago. I was what?

30:25.880 --> 30:27.880

30:42.400 --> 30:45.560
Hashtag you can't see I'm doing a hashtag with my fingers hashtag

30:50.520 --> 30:54.160
So basically we need second she be outfit to learn more female viewers I

30:54.640 --> 30:56.640
think

30:58.480 --> 31:01.280
strongy and management is like worried about

31:02.520 --> 31:05.640
Applying for monetization because like we definitely have it already

31:06.320 --> 31:12.120
for me and Azura because we get we like ran ads on our shorts just to like to test stuff out and

31:13.440 --> 31:16.880
YouTube took a cent from us, but didn't run the ads

31:18.240 --> 31:23.160
Because of the boobs in the thumbnail bitch because of boobs in the thumbnail bitch

31:24.960 --> 31:26.960
And she be up. Oh, oh

31:27.560 --> 31:28.880
That'd be funny

31:28.880 --> 31:34.760
That would actually be kind of funny like a tomboy outfit. I think I'd like to I'm pretty sure that I

31:35.720 --> 31:40.840
Am I the most tomboyish besides straw knee out of everything? I don't know my kid my my demeanor

31:41.600 --> 31:43.600
But more of the bros, you know

31:44.200 --> 31:46.200
Wow, she'd be such a pick me

31:47.360 --> 31:52.840
There is a smudge on my screen. It's making me look like I have a mole on my face and I look kind of hot with it

31:52.840 --> 31:54.840
So I'm like, hmm

31:55.560 --> 31:57.560
More on my face

31:57.880 --> 31:59.600

You can't hear me scream the cutout screams. I don't think this is a horror game

38:10.960 --> 38:19.040
Don't need this by the way. Oh, it's last year's word. It was um, I think it was patience after a member. What the hell

38:23.120 --> 38:27.200
Please open up. Oh, I'm so cute

38:27.200 --> 38:29.200

38:52.640 --> 39:01.200
Oh crap the tack shark he's called a lone shark and he sounds like he's like Italian mafia. That's funny as hell

39:08.080 --> 39:10.080
What are taxes me

39:10.240 --> 39:12.240
This whole area

39:15.520 --> 39:22.080
Commit tax evasion now I have to like get an accountant now. What's a V sucky? You don't need to know

39:31.520 --> 39:33.520
So the lore is

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
I evaded taxes

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
You're somewhere

39:40.160 --> 39:42.160
I oh

39:43.120 --> 39:45.120
Oh

39:46.080 --> 39:51.360
On da da sea oh, there's a freaking bird there. Oh my god. I'm scared

39:54.800 --> 39:57.600
Game is quiet. Can you turn it up? Is it? I have it pretty high

40:02.480 --> 40:04.320
Oh

40:04.320 --> 40:07.440
Wow was randomly super quiet. I don't know why

40:08.960 --> 40:10.960
All right

40:14.640 --> 40:16.640
Quick poster on oh shit, you're right

40:18.160 --> 40:20.720
I keep forgetting guys. I'm not

40:21.840 --> 40:25.840
I'm not used to being a streamer. No, that's that's a fucking lie. I'm not used to

40:26.480 --> 40:32.080
Like streaming on youtube has because I used to be a twitch streamer streaming on youtube is very

40:32.880 --> 40:37.280
Very confusing and very annoying to set up

40:38.000 --> 40:44.560
But it's the easiest thing to do in terms from v2 management. That's why there's a lot of v2 corpos on um

40:45.440 --> 40:47.440
agencies on

40:48.480 --> 40:50.480
YouTube because you can manage

40:50.960 --> 40:55.920
No, I don't want to upgrade to premium. You can manage multiple accounts and payouts and all that jazz

40:56.560 --> 40:58.560
Can I please tweet?

40:58.880 --> 41:00.880
I

41:01.200 --> 41:03.200
Manager tweet for me

41:06.800 --> 41:08.800
Uh

41:08.800 --> 41:10.800
There it is

41:11.840 --> 41:14.720
The temptation to speak like live from new york is saturday night

41:17.440 --> 41:20.480
I'm live link in thread

41:23.040 --> 41:26.640
I've been streaming for

41:27.600 --> 41:29.600
40 minutes

41:31.280 --> 41:36.160
And forgot for gore to tweet again

41:46.400 --> 41:52.480
I forget to do a lot of things I forget I forget to do a lot of things twitch sucks

41:52.480 --> 41:54.480
Ah

41:54.560 --> 41:58.240
Twitch sucks. I know um, sorry I sing a lot

41:59.440 --> 42:01.440
But I'm not a good singer

42:01.600 --> 42:07.440
Uh, it's okay. I think just because I I'm it's what I'm used to okay. So heart kelp

42:08.560 --> 42:10.560
heart kelp is

42:11.440 --> 42:14.480
Is currency but also health question mark

42:17.280 --> 42:19.280
Hey, I know this isn't much but

42:20.240 --> 42:22.800
What the shell is it wait, I don't forget what he sounded like

42:23.680 --> 42:27.520
What that shell is this or he sounded like he was from joysie

42:28.720 --> 42:30.720
They're help kelp heart kelp pods

42:31.360 --> 42:33.360
Don't tell me you don't even like heart kelp

42:34.960 --> 42:38.400
I hope you're joking no one uses these dub things as money anymore

42:39.040 --> 42:42.160
The oceans moved as the trash stand and now trash you got it

42:43.760 --> 42:47.920
Trash so like no pearls either no shiny pirate coins

42:48.720 --> 42:50.720
That's right. None of that crap

42:51.280 --> 42:56.000
So you better find some bread clips or some sauce packets back there. I'm losing my darn patience

42:57.040 --> 43:00.000
Look if if you just give me a couple more tides

43:00.800 --> 43:04.000
All right. I've had enough say. Goodbye to your shallow idiot

43:04.960 --> 43:06.960

43:44.720 --> 43:48.000

43:48.880 --> 43:50.880

43:54.480 --> 43:57.840
Because this are cut off. How does he how?

44:00.320 --> 44:02.720

44:14.720 --> 44:16.720
And I'll tell you

44:16.800 --> 44:18.800
Running ninja style is very effective

44:19.520 --> 44:24.800
Uh, I was one of the fastest girls in middle school. I'll have you know because I ran

44:25.520 --> 44:27.520

46:13.840 --> 46:16.960
Blight town or whatever the fuck it's called from um

46:18.320 --> 46:20.320
From lives of

46:21.280 --> 46:27.920
I keep I'm so used to lives of pee. I'm like pressing my joystick to run but that's not the case

46:31.280 --> 46:33.280
Okay, all right

46:53.440 --> 46:55.440
Acknowledge knowledge. That's cute

46:56.160 --> 47:01.360
Church section. Blight town be tasty. Blight town is dark souls. Oh, I know I remember

47:04.240 --> 47:06.240
Some people who've watched me before

47:08.000 --> 47:12.880
It took me like six hours to beat that stupid

47:13.520 --> 47:15.120
clown looking

47:15.120 --> 47:20.160
Mini boss like it wasn't even a major boss mind you like the hardest boss in lives of pee. I beat no problem

47:20.800 --> 47:22.960
like maybe like three tries but then

47:25.360 --> 47:29.360
The fucking mini clown boss one where he like pushes a boulder at you

47:30.000 --> 47:31.520
I

47:32.000 --> 47:35.520
I had to I got mad. I raged. I closed my stream off

47:36.480 --> 47:40.720
And then I had to um, oh, who's that? Let me just stand over here. He's probably an enemy

47:41.520 --> 47:43.280
And then I had to

47:43.280 --> 47:48.640
I was like, you know, fuck it. I'll beat it offline because I'm getting too frustrated. I don't think it's fun to watch someone rage too hard

47:49.280 --> 47:50.480
um

47:50.480 --> 47:52.000
and

47:52.000 --> 47:53.760
I'm playing

47:53.760 --> 48:00.480
Playing an hour passes. I still haven't beat him. I get so pissed. I spike my

48:01.920 --> 48:05.680
I'm wearing razor black shark headphones. I spike them and they just shatter

48:06.720 --> 48:09.920
So I have little chunks taken out of my headphones where the plastic is

48:12.400 --> 48:17.200
Beat it off line versus beat it beat it off live versus beat it offline

48:17.920 --> 48:19.920
for a rage to whining

48:20.240 --> 48:22.240
The mother of a clown man. I feel it. What?

48:24.000 --> 48:26.240
Tree get woke. Yeah, you know, I got my moments

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
Oh

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
Oh, yeah, I'm like spiked

48:32.240 --> 48:36.480
Keyboards I've I pulled some Tyler ones. I've spiked. Uh, what's it called?

48:37.200 --> 48:38.560
Um controllers

48:38.560 --> 48:42.080
I like I remember I smashed my xbox controller at one point everyone was playing them

48:43.680 --> 48:49.600
Work work work work work. That's what I'm trying to not do. That's why I got to catch up with

48:50.400 --> 48:52.400
worthless

48:52.880 --> 48:56.960
Holy crap. What's wrong with your eyes? I haven't been sleeping or oh god get the way for me

49:00.640 --> 49:07.520
I'm not gonna fight you. Oh, there's so fucking many of them

49:11.680 --> 49:13.680
Oh

49:13.680 --> 49:17.760
Climb climb ha ha you bitches can't climb can you you?

49:18.960 --> 49:22.000
Oh wait, you kind of can uh, no, you're just big

49:23.840 --> 49:26.960
All right, I hope I don't miss anything back there if I did

49:27.840 --> 49:34.160
She's a rager. It's funny. I used to not be rager until I started playing souls like games

49:34.800 --> 49:39.360
But I like the rage from a souls like game. Although, you know, I would rage when I played like cotton stuff

49:41.040 --> 49:44.480
Or like counter strike. Oh, I was so toxic when I played counter strike

49:46.240 --> 49:48.240
I was bad

49:49.440 --> 49:51.920
I was one of those bitches in the lobby that would try to talk like a little boy

49:52.000 --> 49:55.200
So people wouldn't be like is that a girl? Huh going to kitchen

49:57.040 --> 49:58.480
Ooh

49:58.480 --> 50:00.480
Is this my weapon?

50:01.840 --> 50:04.080
I guess I couldn't hurt to have a way to defend myself

50:04.880 --> 50:07.360
This thing's here. I can't talk

50:10.960 --> 50:13.200
If anyone else attacks me, I guess I'll poke him with the pokey bit

50:13.840 --> 50:15.840
Might as well give this bad boy a few practice swings

50:17.680 --> 50:19.680
Found a rusty fork

50:21.600 --> 50:24.240
That suspiciously sounds like the call of the lamb

50:25.200 --> 50:27.200
Thing when you

50:28.320 --> 50:31.840
Like upgrade something attack charge attack

50:38.320 --> 50:40.320
Oh, okay

50:42.800 --> 50:45.680
And this is block. I wonder if I can parry

50:46.720 --> 50:51.920
Please rage on us if you insist. I stopped playing multi games because I raged so much I wasn't able to sleep

50:54.800 --> 50:59.760
Black ops 6 looks actually good. Yeah me and strawnee and a zero are like do we cop? Do we cop and we play?

51:00.880 --> 51:04.000
Because like come on imagine me and azura and strawnee playing

51:04.960 --> 51:06.960
That that'd be funny as fuck

51:08.320 --> 51:10.080
How do I

51:10.080 --> 51:12.080
Can I

51:13.040 --> 51:15.040
Uh, I don't maybe I loop around

51:20.320 --> 51:22.320
R3 to focus on enemies

51:23.280 --> 51:25.280
All right

51:28.400 --> 51:30.640
No, I'm pressing the wrong thing. Oh

51:33.840 --> 51:36.880
Uh now how do I heal? Okay

51:39.280 --> 51:41.280
Sounds like content

51:42.240 --> 51:46.240
Going for fours of six and ever I play like a little bit of fours of an xbox grown up

51:47.200 --> 51:48.240
I

51:48.240 --> 51:52.800
Boy at hands if you play this kind of games or all the same level of skill in your line for a lot of fun. I

51:53.840 --> 51:55.840
Used to I remember I got like

51:56.400 --> 51:58.400
one of my

51:59.040 --> 52:00.720
I play a lot of uh the

52:00.720 --> 52:03.200
Battle royale, whatever the Frick version. Um

52:04.080 --> 52:06.080
Of like the latest caught or like

52:06.400 --> 52:08.400
Whatever and

52:08.400 --> 52:10.400
I got like a golden

52:10.480 --> 52:13.360
Gale like two days because there's no life to fuck out of it

52:14.000 --> 52:17.440
I keep pressing trigger instead of r1

52:27.280 --> 52:29.280
She may congratulate debut

52:30.800 --> 52:32.800
Hold on

52:34.480 --> 52:36.480
Hello sweet rain

52:38.640 --> 52:40.640
Hope you're doing well

52:41.600 --> 52:43.600
You may plus love

52:48.320 --> 52:51.360
Warzone yes, thank you. Uh, yeah, I know life's warzone

52:51.760 --> 52:57.840
I used to play fortnight, but I was just shit at building like my my my baby cousins. They're like, um

52:58.960 --> 53:00.960
14 and 10 now they

53:01.840 --> 53:03.840
smoke me in fortnight

53:04.640 --> 53:06.640
And it's hilarious

53:06.880 --> 53:08.880
Like like this like little 10 year old boy

53:09.600 --> 53:15.200
Like I'm like, is there I'm telling my aunt. I'm like, can you put these kids like one of those like esport colleges?

53:15.200 --> 53:17.200
Like this is ridiculous

53:18.640 --> 53:26.320
I remember when I first started streaming in general. I used to be a fleshy. Um, I wanted to go pro and

53:26.960 --> 53:28.800
Counter strike real bad

53:28.800 --> 53:32.560
Because I was like, oh, I'd be sick to be like a female pro counter strike player

53:34.640 --> 53:36.640
But I was not good enough

53:37.280 --> 53:42.800
That's for sure. What is this? Can I hit it? Why is this pretty sick looking?

53:46.480 --> 53:50.320
All right, no explanation for that. That's cool. Nice

53:53.840 --> 53:56.800
Yeah, I know like they're like I'm doing 90s. Um, blah, blah, blah

53:56.880 --> 54:01.600
I liked I played a lot of fortnight when it first came out and people didn't get the meta yet

54:01.920 --> 54:05.920
About how building is super freaking helpful and they would just build

54:07.360 --> 54:09.760
Pathetically, no, it's great. I miss those days

54:10.640 --> 54:12.560
Whoa, what is that thing?

54:12.560 --> 54:17.120
The current starts getting warm close to this platform. It's kind of comfy. I like I'm skipping every other word

54:17.520 --> 54:19.520
Maybe I caress my feet here. He isn't

54:20.080 --> 54:21.920
So you have feet

54:21.920 --> 54:23.280
for a little while

54:23.280 --> 54:25.440
Where are oh he has like

54:26.480 --> 54:28.480
feet and then he has

54:29.360 --> 54:31.360
Excuse me

54:32.320 --> 54:36.720
He has a little feet that I guess he just doesn't use and then he has

54:38.160 --> 54:41.120
Like one of them is like more raised. What's what's up with that?

54:41.680 --> 54:45.760
Is that one like higher than this one? And then I have my little booty tail that

54:46.640 --> 54:49.840
Hermit crabs used to like hold onto their shell. How many

54:50.560 --> 54:54.240
Legs do crabs have? I don't know. I eat them, but I don't know

54:58.160 --> 55:00.160
Oh

Is anybody am I gonna get like a explanation for like the lore of the moonshell?

56:01.760 --> 56:03.760
No, all right

56:03.920 --> 56:08.160

56:10.640 --> 56:14.000
Oh, it's him. I don't know why it looked like a bird to me. Um

56:14.960 --> 56:18.000

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
Mommy face attacks are perfect for Zara

56:48.960 --> 56:54.560
Uh, I want to watch a Zara game. She's a great gamer. She kicked everybody's asses in uh among us

56:55.840 --> 56:57.440

I kicked ass

56:59.440 --> 57:00.720

57:47.200 --> 57:49.200
The fuck is this music

57:50.080 --> 57:53.600
Ayo, is that my mouth? Oh, it's my heart inside my chest

57:54.800 --> 57:58.320
Huh, it's very interesting that that's there. That's the asset

58:02.800 --> 58:06.320
Whoa, whoa, whoa, don't say your type leaving the type pool too often

58:06.960 --> 58:10.080
Yeah, well, I didn't have a choice. Can you tell me what's going on here?

58:10.160 --> 58:12.400
I heard like there's a duchess in charge now

58:12.960 --> 58:19.520
Yep, sure is real piece of work takes all my hard-earned micro plastics every tie just for existing around here

58:20.160 --> 58:26.000
What do I see for it? Nothing just keeps building up her castle and hiring more soldiers to defend it

58:27.200 --> 58:30.480
Oh, that's cool. Where can I find her? I think she has something in mind

58:32.480 --> 58:34.960
So that's when I thought you're getting brand new models the day after debut

58:35.920 --> 58:37.520
Why?

58:37.520 --> 58:39.520
Why would you think that?

58:42.240 --> 58:43.680
That's not gonna happen

58:43.680 --> 58:48.720
Mommy put so much time and offered her money into these models. Oh my god. You guys don't even know the half of it

58:50.480 --> 58:55.920
Kind of freeloader area, but you think you skirt your taxes while the rest of us keeps the side together, do you?

58:56.320 --> 58:57.920
You just said

58:57.920 --> 59:03.760
You hermit crabs are all the same wearing the shells the rest of us worked so hard to create with our own mantles

59:03.760 --> 59:07.520
That's a good point. You gotta stayed in your tide pool small fry

59:11.440 --> 59:13.440

59:46.560 --> 59:48.560

59:48.880 --> 59:52.560
Like I know my ass is fat, but like I could totally slide that I can totally like, you know

59:54.320 --> 59:56.800

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:23.280
Okay, um

Wait, is that like a lure can I like there's plenty of plastics here. There's plenty of trash. Can I grab this?

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:34.080
I'll make my own micro plastics. Oh, this is really sad though

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:37.040
It was probably what the ocean. Oh looks like

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:42.880
I know I should be focusing on them, but I don't really care what that

01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:46.880
Oh sick

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:48.960
Off to see the wizard

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:52.720
I'm wondering if there's anything off to the side. What's that?

01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:56.720
Is that a shell?

01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:57.840
Oh

01:00:57.840 --> 01:00:59.840
No, it's just some weird party popper shit

01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:05.600
Damn, this isn't big. Can I like go off the beaten track because I'm guessing that little

01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:10.960
Little road the little micro plastic brick road is a um

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:13.840
It's like the main quest, but

This game is cooler than I expected

01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:25.680
I've seen like a little bit of gameplay from this

01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:29.040
No, like spoiler. Oh, can I stick my mouth on that?

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:32.400
They're shiny so it means I can interact with them, right?

01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:38.160
Just like uh from my spongebob. Oh, what's up there?

01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:42.160
Oh

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:48.960
I should be able to platform up there. I just don't know how

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:53.280
If I

01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:55.840
Maybe if I we're running start

Nope because I'm like, okay. What if I get up there

And then jump over there, but I don't think so. Fuck your mother. Fuck your mother. Fuck your mother. Fuck your mother

01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:09.840
Oh

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:21.680
Why did the crab cross the road?

01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:26.960
Can I

01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:29.680

Oh

01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:51.840
Spherulin my blood star easily

01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:55.520
Okay

01:03:57.920 --> 01:03:59.920
They won't notice me

01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:04.960
Oh, I like how it kind of shimmies side to side like a crab

01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:09.200
Can I am I dead? Oh shit

01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:16.640
Well

01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:20.640

Just fall through the map for a second

Put that up there, you know, I need to put these bitties on display, you know

Frick I'm not paying attention

01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:40.240
Of dark souls that I learned the hard way is that you don't have to fight everyone again

01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:43.760
I would go through and I would just try to fight people

01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:45.840
And I'm like, oh wait

01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:51.040
I can just run past you and come back to this later if I really need to talk to you or do this

01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:53.680
thingy

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:55.840
What did you say?

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.120
Is the shell gone? All right

01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:19.280
Telling you music is good

01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:26.880
I'm assuming I drop stuff. I think they did say that

01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:30.880
Yeah, it's over there. I don't know why I press that but go off says

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:33.360
Are you winning? Oh

01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:35.360
uh debatable

01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:37.600
Wait, there's another thing. Oh, I'll look at that later

01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:46.000
Okay, I don't need uh, okay fine come on come on

Why are you down there? Come on

01:06:56.880 --> 01:07:00.320
I don't have to take on both of you at the same time. It's too much work

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:09.840
Do you have more? Oh, I wasn't locked on. Oh, I didn't even mean to

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:20.400
Oh, how did you brother excuse me

01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:24.960
Don't don't don't

01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:30.400
Check out laughs. Have you beat dark souls one play about that? No

01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:34.960
The only game I've beaten is Elden Ring

01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:40.560
I remember I played Sekiro and I'm like wow. Sekiro was the first um

01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:47.360
Souls like I played I didn't even know it was a souls like I just was like, oh this game is getting a lot of hype

01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:49.360
Let me get it and I

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:50.560
I

01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:52.560
Was severely mistaken

01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:54.320
What the fuck?

01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:57.360
Are you why are you flying away? Oh god

01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:04.080
Just fuck off already. Okay

01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:08.640
Why can't I pick it up? I'm clicking try

01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:14.400
Is this a joke? Oh wait, it's because

01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:21.600
I

01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:24.160
Mentioned I'm blonde

01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:29.680
She be shut up

01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:35.600
How can you

01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:43.360
Oh fuck

01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:46.080
I

01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:52.240
Why do they cry like a puppy? Uh, I think I'm good. I don't know what that is. Is it a bird claw?

01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:58.000
Is this the right way? I feel like it's barp talk ramping along distance

01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:06.560
Oh, okay, cool beans. I think I keep going this way

01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:10.880
Gotta go to the bonfire over here

01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:17.040
You know blonde emo well, there is an emo of me going do so

01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:29.520
I still don't think I have enough micro plastics or whatever the fuck to upgrade

01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:33.120
Yeah

01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:35.840
All right

01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:39.440
Hey brother

01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:43.760
Oh

01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:48.160
That's all give me your fucking money

01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:55.280
Oh, there's two in nature. Let's get that's my emmy impression

01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:04.160
Just kidding. No, I actually I think if I'd really tried I want to do a stream where I try to do impressions of the girls

01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:06.560
I

01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:11.680
Think I could do icy's voice. I think I could do emmy's voice

01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:18.720
I can't do strongy's voice because I can't get her accent down. I can kind of do Azura's voice

01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:24.400
But

01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:27.920
Mercy mercy is actually also kind of hard to do I really think about it

01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:33.520
I realize if a girl's voice is like higher pitched. I can usually do it easier

01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:41.520

Like

01:16:14.220 --> 01:16:17.980
Actually, no, I'm not gonna say that because I actually loved Elden Ring because of how open world it was

01:16:19.580 --> 01:16:21.740

What the fuck was that? I'm like I'm crying. I just noticed I'm crab crawling

01:17:05.980 --> 01:17:10.700
Oh, oh shit, okay, that's a two hit kill. That's good to know

01:17:11.020 --> 01:17:13.020
Oh

01:17:17.180 --> 01:17:24.140
Did I slice the glass bottle in half? Well, yes, I did. All right, uh, at least I know that I go this way

Oh, oh, okay, this must be the duchy

01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:43.900
Okay, so let me just oh god a moment. I need to go get my stuff

01:17:45.900 --> 01:17:51.100
So, yeah, this is like the path that I'm supposed to take of cigarette butts loveliness

01:17:57.420 --> 01:17:59.420
I've asked you

01:18:00.300 --> 01:18:02.300
Oh

01:18:11.980 --> 01:18:16.620
Nope not this way oh for the love of god, where am I?

01:18:19.420 --> 01:18:23.420
I want you to squeeze me while I'm on my period and call me your little catch-up packet

01:18:23.420 --> 01:18:31.180
Call me your little fruit gusher. What a yo

01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:38.140
Huh um base

01:18:44.540 --> 01:18:49.180
Gushy-ushy someone sent in my marrow something

01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:53.900
They said shabussy

01:18:55.580 --> 01:19:02.140
And it gave me a good laugh, so thank you really I'm sorry for what I'm about to say and then they just said shabussy

01:19:07.260 --> 01:19:10.380
What okay, what was that like in the wall?

01:19:15.020 --> 01:19:18.220
Should I fight him should I fight him guys

01:19:19.980 --> 01:19:23.500
My hands are sweating. Let me just wipe a mama titties

01:19:28.380 --> 01:19:33.340
Shabby woody, I don't know what I'm talking about half the time do it for the plastic kill. Okay

01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:39.500
We'll creep up

01:19:50.060 --> 01:19:52.060
Oh

01:19:56.300 --> 01:19:58.300
Shit, uh

01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:05.500
I'm stuck. Oh god. What the fuck?

01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:09.980
He needed me

01:20:09.980 --> 01:20:11.980
He

01:20:15.020 --> 01:20:19.180
Slam me against a wall. Okay. Yeah, I don't think I'm gonna fight him right now. I'm just gonna try to progress

01:20:20.380 --> 01:20:24.220
It's kind of like the thing like you know you got to pick and choose your battles. It's okay

01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:28.540
I don't

01:20:28.540 --> 01:20:34.540
Like I definitely could beat him, but like I just hate running all the way back to get my shit and it's just annoying

01:20:35.100 --> 01:20:37.100
I

01:20:37.580 --> 01:20:39.580
Would just take a couple of tries

01:20:39.900 --> 01:20:41.900
Folded me like a steel chair. I

01:20:42.460 --> 01:20:45.660
Admit that is true. Well, there's one of those things up top there

01:20:48.860 --> 01:20:50.860
Then I can level up anyways

01:20:52.060 --> 01:20:54.060
Hello Krabos

01:21:05.020 --> 01:21:11.260
All right, oh fuck you saw me

01:21:15.900 --> 01:21:17.900
Okay, he didn't see me

01:21:19.740 --> 01:21:21.740
But oh, I hate the crabs

01:21:22.620 --> 01:21:24.780
It'll wait on later exactly run

01:21:25.820 --> 01:21:30.700
All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Okay. I'm guessing those are sea urchins and they would hurt me so

01:21:31.660 --> 01:21:33.660
It's not fuck with those things

01:21:33.900 --> 01:21:35.900
Do you want to like farm a little bit?

01:21:43.660 --> 01:21:45.260
All right

01:21:45.260 --> 01:21:50.380
I just like don't like I want to see if I can parry but I'm I also just don't want to waste health

01:21:52.620 --> 01:21:54.620
Yeah, like uh

01:21:55.180 --> 01:21:57.180
Like one hit just fucks me so

01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:01.500
Yeah, can I

01:22:02.460 --> 01:22:04.460
Yeah, I have to figure out the timing

01:22:05.900 --> 01:22:07.900
Come on

01:22:08.700 --> 01:22:10.700
No, see I feel like I timed that right

01:22:12.540 --> 01:22:14.540
All right, I give up

01:22:18.380 --> 01:22:20.380
Da-da-da-da-da

01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:23.500
He shelled a pair oh

01:22:24.860 --> 01:22:28.140
Look at me. I'm like trying to fucking parry and it's not an ability I have yet

01:22:28.860 --> 01:22:30.860
What the hell

01:22:32.460 --> 01:22:34.460
Why are you rolling up on me like that, bro?

01:22:37.260 --> 01:22:39.260
Insha'Allah

01:22:41.820 --> 01:22:46.700
All right, I'm guessing I can find a show with these guys or with the duchy

01:22:50.060 --> 01:22:52.060
Yo, yo, yo

01:22:52.060 --> 01:22:53.980
Halt trespasser

01:22:53.980 --> 01:22:57.740
By order of the duchess all suspicious characters are to be bored from slack tight

01:22:58.700 --> 01:23:00.700
Suspicious

01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:03.420
I forgot the voice of them

01:23:03.660 --> 01:23:08.540
Suspicious, I thought I looked pretty harmless downright adorable. Huggable even

01:23:09.740 --> 01:23:15.100
Perhaps you speak of truth vagrants, but I shalt ne'er grant you entry twix these mighty gates

01:23:15.580 --> 01:23:18.860
Whilst thy loins remained unguarded

01:23:21.660 --> 01:23:23.660
Ex shucking excuse me

01:23:24.300 --> 01:23:26.300
Dude take a hint she says you're naked

01:23:26.860 --> 01:23:29.340
Oh, yeah, I guess I hadn't thought about that. Is that important these days?

01:23:30.060 --> 01:23:33.900
I feel like society has really moved on without me while I've been practicing self-care

01:23:34.940 --> 01:23:36.940
Sure seems like it

01:23:37.020 --> 01:23:40.300
The duchess would have our heads if we let you in wearing nothing but a rag

01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:43.500
Fret not little crustacean

01:23:43.500 --> 01:23:47.580
nearby to the east layeth a repository laden with complimentary commentary

01:23:49.100 --> 01:23:53.340
Face the gate you turn right you'll find a cherry center where you get something to wear

01:23:54.300 --> 01:23:57.580
Captain is stationed right there now. I think great guy. He'll get you sorted

01:23:58.540 --> 01:24:00.540
Sounds cool. Let me in

01:24:01.420 --> 01:24:06.540
Assuming nothing sketchy comes up in your background checks. Sure. Just how the fuck are you gonna run a background check on me?

01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:12.780
Okay, so I must be past the berserker crap then my hands just went

01:24:14.540 --> 01:24:16.540
I have to get drip

01:24:16.540 --> 01:24:18.540
I

01:24:21.740 --> 01:24:23.740
Can't climb up stuff. Oh

01:24:29.100 --> 01:24:32.620
Oh, how convenient what am I doing?

01:24:39.580 --> 01:24:41.580
I like I stick in my little pocket

01:24:44.220 --> 01:24:46.220
All right

01:24:47.340 --> 01:24:49.500
I see a blinking thing over there

01:24:52.060 --> 01:24:54.860
But I felt like I saw something behind it hold on

01:24:57.020 --> 01:24:59.020
Hello

01:25:00.700 --> 01:25:02.700
Are you fucking dead?

01:25:04.860 --> 01:25:09.260
Wake the fuck up. What do you have an egg on your head? Do you have a ramen? What's happening?

01:25:10.780 --> 01:25:12.780
Oh, I can't go past. Oh

01:25:14.380 --> 01:25:15.820
All right

01:25:15.900 --> 01:25:17.900
Durer show

01:25:18.620 --> 01:25:21.180
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just I still want to explore a little bit

01:25:23.660 --> 01:25:29.020
You like her because she's dead. Oh, are these guys dead?

01:25:34.540 --> 01:25:37.100
You know, you're in what you're into but I think that's breaking a law

01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:41.020
Oh, no, I forgot to check on the last popsicle sticks that I saw back near the moon shell

01:25:42.380 --> 01:25:44.940
Did you hear about the crab that went to the gym?

01:25:46.780 --> 01:25:48.780
He pulled a muscle

01:25:57.180 --> 01:26:03.580
What's she guys doing can I hang out with y'all? Oh, his legs are uh, you know, it's a good time. What this?

01:26:06.380 --> 01:26:08.380
Captain there's a captain not around

01:26:16.700 --> 01:26:18.700
Oh

01:26:23.100 --> 01:26:26.940
Oh, it's like a it's like a little lobster neck tie thing

01:26:28.860 --> 01:26:31.260
Oh the son of music. Oh, why are these?

01:26:33.340 --> 01:26:36.380
I generally can't tell if they're dead or they're just tied to poles

01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:41.340
I thought that was the shark dude for a second, but it's just a broom

01:26:42.380 --> 01:26:45.500
And that is a gas thing. That's nice

01:26:46.220 --> 01:26:48.220
And there's fishies

01:26:49.020 --> 01:26:50.700
Uh

01:26:50.700 --> 01:26:55.820
Excuse me. Why do you have a ravioli head and the other one had a ramen head?

01:27:00.460 --> 01:27:02.460
Oh sick nasty brother

01:27:03.740 --> 01:27:05.740
Do-do-do-do

01:27:06.380 --> 01:27:08.380
Oh, are they all the same?

01:27:10.060 --> 01:27:12.060
Yeah, seems like it. Okay. I like

01:27:13.340 --> 01:27:14.620
this one

01:27:14.620 --> 01:27:16.620
Oh

01:27:16.620 --> 01:27:18.620
I can do the can can

01:27:22.700 --> 01:27:26.780
Wait, that wasn't it. Oh, I accidentally took a screenshot

01:27:31.820 --> 01:27:39.980
I'm gonna keep my little my little face on my little my little a real mouth. I think my a real mouth is very fitting

01:27:39.980 --> 01:27:47.020
This shell chafes like heck compared to my what the hell

Found a weird it's got a can of my booty press old l1

01:28:00.140 --> 01:28:03.980

01:28:37.660 --> 01:28:39.660
Hear you cross the ocean

01:28:44.940 --> 01:28:46.940
Should be can bum

01:28:53.820 --> 01:28:57.260
The voice actor went so hard I love it

01:28:58.460 --> 01:29:04.220
Okay, I'm assuming. Okay. I got like chug jug energy in the bottom. So holy shit. Oh, okay

01:29:04.700 --> 01:29:06.700
Uh, all right treason. Oh, let's go

01:29:09.900 --> 01:29:13.980
All right, what else you got? All right

01:29:18.220 --> 01:29:23.980
Oh, I pressed the wrong thing. Oh, I pressed it l2 instead of l1

01:29:25.260 --> 01:29:27.260
There's a moon jelly location

01:29:30.220 --> 01:29:32.220
What the fuck

01:29:33.180 --> 01:29:35.180
Huh

01:29:36.700 --> 01:29:39.820
Is that like the america thing

01:29:43.100 --> 01:29:44.700
Gianni

01:29:44.700 --> 01:29:48.460
Mattagrano stays America. No, it's his market

01:29:49.900 --> 01:29:51.900
It's leaving with the fishes

01:29:53.500 --> 01:29:55.500
Oh, let me stretch my leggies

01:29:55.740 --> 01:29:57.740
Oh

01:29:59.260 --> 01:30:04.460
No, no, I have a strap have a strap. So I'll bring him closer to me so I can jump between the cans

01:30:08.140 --> 01:30:10.140
And I usually I like let the

01:30:12.780 --> 01:30:17.100
Okay, can I like skip it? Um, although he's an amazing voice actor, but

01:30:17.820 --> 01:30:22.300
Wait, where is he coming from? Oh, uh, I usually like to see what their move set is

01:30:23.100 --> 01:30:29.980
But I kind of he just swings his thing and then also side dashes and he probably does a charge too. I'm guessing

01:30:32.060 --> 01:30:34.060
Yeah, that's a charge

01:30:41.900 --> 01:30:44.780
See oh, all right

01:30:53.020 --> 01:30:55.020
Um

01:30:58.540 --> 01:31:00.540
Well

01:31:00.860 --> 01:31:02.860
Listen, I'm just

01:31:02.860 --> 01:31:04.860
I'm just figuring out the game

01:31:05.260 --> 01:31:06.860
so

01:31:06.860 --> 01:31:08.860
Can you be nice to me?

01:31:09.980 --> 01:31:11.980
Okay

01:31:14.140 --> 01:31:16.140
Okay

01:31:18.140 --> 01:31:20.140
Third time's the charm let's fucking do this

01:31:21.020 --> 01:31:23.020
Oh, all right

01:31:24.220 --> 01:31:28.140
Palms are sweaty there's vomit on his sweater already mom's canned spaghetti

01:31:32.620 --> 01:31:35.500
I wish after like the third time this happens he would just stop

01:31:36.380 --> 01:31:38.380

01:31:38.380 --> 01:31:40.380

01:32:32.780 --> 01:32:34.300
We're learning

01:32:34.300 --> 01:32:38.940
Hey, I never said I was good at games. All right, so

01:32:40.780 --> 01:32:42.780
Take that with what you will

01:32:43.900 --> 01:32:45.900
Body

01:32:46.780 --> 01:32:51.820
It's kind of jarring to hear milf is an uwu voice. Well, we're gonna hear it all today, right?

01:32:56.220 --> 01:32:58.700
I've been told I have like a big sister sounding voice

01:32:59.420 --> 01:33:01.980
It's only when I get really deep and I talk in my

01:33:03.260 --> 01:33:05.260
patreon audio recording voice

01:33:06.380 --> 01:33:08.860
Then I sound like a mommy

01:33:13.020 --> 01:33:15.500
What the fuck I went in my shell the timing is hard

01:33:16.700 --> 01:33:18.700
I did it again

01:33:21.260 --> 01:33:23.260
Okay

01:33:27.580 --> 01:33:29.580

Oh he can donkey kick. All right

01:33:46.460 --> 01:33:48.460
Oh

01:33:51.260 --> 01:33:53.260
I should probably lock on to him

01:34:10.220 --> 01:34:12.540

01:34:16.700 --> 01:34:20.380

Can you believe the range on that?

01:34:48.620 --> 01:34:52.140
I would advise against sucking justice out of his book. What?

01:34:53.420 --> 01:34:55.420
Why have you done it? Are you serious from experience?

01:34:58.860 --> 01:35:03.260
My image of playing you shooting me a pro CS player is quickly falling apart

01:35:03.980 --> 01:35:06.620
No, I never said I said I wanted to go pro

01:35:07.580 --> 01:35:09.580
I never said I was pro

01:35:13.900 --> 01:35:16.380
Okay, hold on and you get some drink

Oh

01:41:31.100 --> 01:41:33.100
Literally a cat girl

01:41:35.500 --> 01:41:38.860
Yeah, I don't know why the price has come up like that for some of the items

01:41:38.940 --> 01:41:43.420
It's really weird because I saw that for mine at 1.2. So I think it's some weird sight thing

01:41:44.300 --> 01:41:46.300
It's a bussy hitting right just right

01:41:48.940 --> 01:41:50.940
Fia my beloved

01:41:51.500 --> 01:41:54.060
Yeah, Fia Fia's Fia's been through a lot

01:41:55.580 --> 01:41:57.580
Um at one point

01:41:58.300 --> 01:42:00.860
She had uh recently back in like march

01:42:01.580 --> 01:42:04.060
She had some um weird thing going on where

01:42:04.860 --> 01:42:07.580
Her legs didn't work at all. She couldn't move

01:42:08.220 --> 01:42:12.700
Uh, they still don't know what caused it. They gave her they didn't know if she had some sort of

01:42:12.940 --> 01:42:18.060
That she snapped her Achilles tendons. They didn't know if she had some spinal issues. We ran so many tests

01:42:18.460 --> 01:42:21.260
They're like, oh, she has like the wobble syndrome and they're like

01:42:21.980 --> 01:42:27.980
Then she didn't end up having the wobble syndrome or where you can't like cats can't move properly neurologically

01:42:28.620 --> 01:42:30.380
um

01:42:30.380 --> 01:42:31.900
and

01:42:31.900 --> 01:42:37.260
Then another random like and like so many vets so many doctors were like

01:42:38.220 --> 01:42:43.420
What but like they were they had never seen a case like this because like they ran so many tests on her

01:42:44.140 --> 01:42:46.140
and my credit card is

01:42:46.620 --> 01:42:48.220
Still crying

01:42:48.220 --> 01:42:53.660
Because of that, but I will do anything for her. Um, why is the chat so weird? There we go

01:42:54.940 --> 01:42:56.940
and um

01:42:57.340 --> 01:43:03.260
And then they some random doctor was like, maybe it's toxoplasmosis and toxoplasmosis is like it's a

01:43:04.140 --> 01:43:11.340
It's a bacteria or a virus you can get from like usually like pregnant women get it when they like scoop a cat's litter box

01:43:11.820 --> 01:43:14.140
Which doesn't make sense to me. Um

01:43:15.500 --> 01:43:17.500
But she

01:43:18.060 --> 01:43:24.300
Or if you like eat raw meat, it's like the cat equivalent for like salmonella and um

01:43:25.740 --> 01:43:30.140
My cat had that when she had an infection on the bone's intertail. Oh snap. Wow. I hope your cat's okay now

01:43:30.700 --> 01:43:31.740
um

01:43:31.740 --> 01:43:36.140
And so they're like to give her some antibiotics and so they did

01:43:36.940 --> 01:43:38.540
And it worked

01:43:38.540 --> 01:43:40.540
And she can walk and it's great

01:43:41.420 --> 01:43:45.580
It's freaking amazing now she can she's still working on jumping because she's building up her confidence again

01:43:45.580 --> 01:43:47.580
Because she couldn't move for like a month and a half

01:43:47.580 --> 01:43:52.380
I carried her around in her little cat bed and I had to like hold her up to use a bathroom and stuff

01:43:52.380 --> 01:43:56.540
It was very sad, but she's a good she's she's zooming everywhere now. She's my baby

01:43:57.260 --> 01:44:01.260
She's like you might hear her screaming at some point because she likes to play with a little spring toy

01:44:01.740 --> 01:44:03.740
And she gets really excited and she be house with it

01:44:04.540 --> 01:44:09.580
But yeah, she's good. She's good. Don't worry about it. Um, she's I usually I have a cat bed on my desk

01:44:10.060 --> 01:44:13.580
And her boomy and rena will sometimes lay in the cat bed

01:44:13.580 --> 01:44:18.300
And so I usually I like to have a cat cam up so you guys can see the cats and then I can also like

01:44:18.860 --> 01:44:20.860
flip you off um

01:44:21.020 --> 01:44:23.020
in the

01:44:23.180 --> 01:44:25.500
On camera, um, so yeah

01:44:28.140 --> 01:44:31.500
At least she has you as a caretaker. Yeah, I'm very devoted to my animals

01:44:31.500 --> 01:44:33.740
I growing up I almost became a veterinarian

01:44:34.940 --> 01:44:36.940
but um

01:44:36.940 --> 01:44:38.380
I was a slacker

01:44:38.380 --> 01:44:40.220
I slacked

01:44:40.220 --> 01:44:43.180
Wait, did did management finally tweet out that we have merch?

01:44:44.220 --> 01:44:46.220
Hold on

01:44:47.340 --> 01:44:51.980
Hold on, but yeah, don't worry about the donation thing so you can always support through patreon

01:44:52.460 --> 01:44:57.580
um, patreon is also in the description below if uh, you can just throw five bucks my way and

01:44:57.900 --> 01:45:00.940
Again, you don't have to consume what's on the patreon if you're not into that

01:45:01.500 --> 01:45:05.580
But if you're like I want to help out or you know like comment subscribe

01:45:08.860 --> 01:45:11.660
Wait or is it did they tweet I will retweet

01:45:15.740 --> 01:45:18.300
I just I know I'm weird and I prefer Twitter on mobile

01:45:21.180 --> 01:45:23.180
Oh

01:45:28.540 --> 01:45:34.220
Why can't you mean no okay, they did oh crap

01:45:37.100 --> 01:45:46.940
But um, yeah anything you guys donate uh, or like if support honestly just you just being here is support enough for me to be honest

01:45:47.500 --> 01:45:48.940
um

01:45:48.940 --> 01:45:55.420
But that goes towards my dream of buying my own house and having an animal sanctuary and also paying all my debt

01:45:56.380 --> 01:45:58.380
because

01:46:03.100 --> 01:46:05.100
Man, I love college

01:46:05.660 --> 01:46:08.700
That party last night was awfully crazy

01:46:09.260 --> 01:46:13.580
I miss your day, but don't feel pressured to buy like I don't want you to be like wow

01:46:13.900 --> 01:46:17.500
You know Dami mommy she be was said I had to buy her merch

01:46:18.140 --> 01:46:24.780
You don't have to it's great because a hundred percent of it the money goes to me minus my split with ubu market

01:46:25.500 --> 01:46:31.660
But only what you can't I don't want you if you're like I need this to eat this week

01:46:31.900 --> 01:46:33.900
Do not give me your money

01:46:34.700 --> 01:46:36.860
And also make sure you support the other girls as well

01:46:37.500 --> 01:46:44.940
Guilty us now or no no no no buy buy my merch. I'll be homeless. No, I'm fine again. Remember guys. I have a job

01:46:46.060 --> 01:46:49.660
I still have a job like I would like to stream full time, but

01:46:50.700 --> 01:46:51.980
that is

01:46:52.060 --> 01:46:55.100
Based off of you guys. I'm not going to put the pressure

01:46:55.820 --> 01:46:59.820
My livelihood on people who just want to sit back and watch a buddy girl, you know

01:47:01.180 --> 01:47:03.420
Food is temporary. I am forever

01:47:06.780 --> 01:47:10.060
No, no stop. Okay. Anyways, I'm losing my voice

01:47:11.580 --> 01:47:14.780
Someone please help me with my monthly budget 40% for after

01:47:16.700 --> 01:47:20.300
Finda no, I'm not into finda people somebody that has asked me that before

01:47:21.180 --> 01:47:26.380
In my maros if I if I am one of the financial domination ones and I do not

01:47:27.340 --> 01:47:31.500
Like that because sometimes people can be really taken advantage of

01:47:33.420 --> 01:47:35.100
Not a fan of that

01:47:35.100 --> 01:47:38.220
That's why I'm like only get what you can don't feel pressured

01:47:39.180 --> 01:47:43.980
If you can't give it all just like comment retweet spread word of my

01:47:44.620 --> 01:47:48.140
Terribleness to other people. I somebody's tell me that

01:47:48.780 --> 01:47:54.300
In my maros that they're like, oh, yeah, I showed my my stream your stream to a friend and I'm like

01:47:55.100 --> 01:47:56.460
oh

01:47:56.460 --> 01:48:01.100
No, and then that person left a mirror. I was like, thank you. No, no the same person

01:48:01.420 --> 01:48:04.940
somebody showed the stream to them and they were like

01:48:05.340 --> 01:48:12.140
They left me a really nice message about how I reminded them of someone that they used to be close to in the past and it was nice

01:48:12.860 --> 01:48:19.100
And I was just like, oh, I'm happy I could touch that person in a different way than I would normally touch people

01:48:19.180 --> 01:48:20.780
What that sounds?

01:48:20.780 --> 01:48:22.780
predatory

01:48:25.900 --> 01:48:29.900
We went from we want fdom not fdom in this one

01:48:31.340 --> 01:48:35.100
Just a little sus. Don't worry about it. She loves us. I don't love you

01:48:37.500 --> 01:48:39.500
debatable

01:48:40.380 --> 01:48:43.900
Yeah, I have to tell myself that or I'll get parasocial

01:48:45.740 --> 01:48:47.740
base take actually

01:48:48.220 --> 01:48:50.220
You can't get a pair of social guys

01:48:52.140 --> 01:48:55.420
She hates us. I totally hate you. I hate you so much

01:49:01.260 --> 01:49:03.260
You know what

01:49:03.340 --> 01:49:06.220
Oh, okay. I think I'll stream it for a little bit longer

01:49:07.100 --> 01:49:10.060
But if you I know like I think stronti is still streaming

01:49:10.300 --> 01:49:12.220
But if you also want to watch

01:49:12.860 --> 01:49:14.860
Amy when she starts streaming

01:49:14.860 --> 01:49:19.820
Feel free to again. No pressure support all the girls all the girls deserve them the most

01:49:25.980 --> 01:49:27.980
Law breaker. Oh

01:49:30.300 --> 01:49:33.820
I don't know why I sound like prince. Am I blind?

01:49:36.220 --> 01:49:38.220
Oh

01:49:38.220 --> 01:49:40.220
I am blind

01:49:47.340 --> 01:49:50.860
I pressed the right thing I will tell you that much

01:49:53.820 --> 01:49:56.060
Bro, I'm

01:49:58.300 --> 01:50:00.300
I don't

01:50:00.300 --> 01:50:01.980
It might be me

01:50:01.980 --> 01:50:07.180
But I don't like the timing of because I'll press I think the animation of me hopping in the shell

01:50:07.260 --> 01:50:09.260
Like I have to do it before

01:50:11.820 --> 01:50:14.860
No, I don't ma I'm not winning. I'm doing terrible

01:50:21.340 --> 01:50:24.540
I tended to leave stuff because I'm about to say something parasocial

01:50:25.660 --> 01:50:27.660
Bro, I get it. I totally I remember

01:50:28.540 --> 01:50:32.380
When so I worked from home for a little while. I'll tell

01:50:33.420 --> 01:50:35.420
Trigger it after I tell my story

01:50:35.900 --> 01:50:43.260
And I like was very agoraphobic didn't leave my house for six months. Well, I um, I was like real neat

01:50:43.900 --> 01:50:45.900
Hickey morey neat girl. Um

01:50:46.860 --> 01:50:48.860
And so I just watched this one vtuber

01:50:49.500 --> 01:50:51.820
Well, I watched multiple vtubers, but I was like, oh my god

01:50:52.620 --> 01:50:54.620
I want to be her friend. She makes me so happy

01:50:55.180 --> 01:50:58.060
My god, she's my oh she so like I get it. I totally get it

01:50:59.180 --> 01:51:01.180
Like everybody wants that sort of

01:51:01.660 --> 01:51:03.660
connection

01:51:05.500 --> 01:51:07.500
He has never known defeat

01:51:07.900 --> 01:51:10.060
Yeah, timing I'm still getting used to the timing

01:51:12.540 --> 01:51:15.260
I think if I put him up against like the

01:51:17.260 --> 01:51:20.060
I like I'm wondering if I will he kicks up. Okay. Well

01:51:21.020 --> 01:51:23.020
Oh

01:51:23.420 --> 01:51:25.660
And he also does the fucking back kick too though

01:51:30.620 --> 01:51:34.620
Oh, is my game lagging no, well, I'm already fucked

01:51:36.300 --> 01:51:38.300
I'm already fucked

01:51:39.020 --> 01:51:41.020
Can I just give me a moment

01:51:43.340 --> 01:51:45.820
Give me a moment, please for the love of god

01:51:50.620 --> 01:51:54.700
I like bugged out for me to wear the shell

01:51:58.940 --> 01:52:00.940
Oh, yeah, no, like

01:52:00.940 --> 01:52:07.180
I'm trying. Let's go parasocial. Yeah parasocialism has its pros and cons because obviously it gives you something

01:52:07.180 --> 01:52:09.180
but it takes stuff away because um

01:52:10.220 --> 01:52:13.500
Yeah, you then you remember. Oh just a person on the internet

01:52:15.020 --> 01:52:18.380
Playing a really cute anime buddy that makes you

01:52:19.260 --> 01:52:21.260
Um

01:52:21.660 --> 01:52:23.660
But

01:52:24.780 --> 01:52:29.820
Like but it's totally natural to want to develop a relationship with someone that you have similar interests with and

01:52:31.180 --> 01:52:32.540
But it just like

01:52:32.540 --> 01:52:36.300
Understanding like oh, you know, I might I will never probably meet them

01:52:37.020 --> 01:52:39.020
I never

01:52:40.460 --> 01:52:42.960
Can have that sort of thing. Yeah, it's hard

01:52:48.380 --> 01:52:55.100
I I I'm pressing circle. I'm pressing circle for the love of god. I'm pressing circle

01:52:57.420 --> 01:52:59.420
I hate

01:53:08.700 --> 01:53:10.700
Oh, don't back kick me, please

01:53:12.060 --> 01:53:16.380
I hate that straw, dude. Why am I getting ganked by a straw?

01:53:19.020 --> 01:53:21.020
Should be his tongue fellow

01:53:24.220 --> 01:53:26.380
That's on my side. Why are you talking on that?

01:53:30.140 --> 01:53:32.140
Why is he still talking?

01:53:38.220 --> 01:53:41.420
Do you have tongue physics? I I can stick out my tongue. That's it

01:53:41.980 --> 01:53:43.980
But I think it's funny because

01:53:43.980 --> 01:53:45.980
artists never rendered the tongue

01:53:46.940 --> 01:53:48.940
So I guess how about pink tongue?

01:53:51.500 --> 01:53:56.220
You know what I should fucking do I should uh, I really should level up but

01:54:00.700 --> 01:54:05.420
Yeah, I'm uh, I'm someone who falls so hard like

01:54:06.780 --> 01:54:08.780
Like tomah said

01:54:09.260 --> 01:54:13.020
Like when I care about someone I care deeply like the girls I'm like, I love you

01:54:13.420 --> 01:54:17.980
You're my best friends now and they're like girl. We just met now. I'm kidding. They're just like me us too

01:54:18.860 --> 01:54:20.860
We're all just fucking parasocial towards each other

01:54:26.060 --> 01:54:31.820
My game is lagging a little bit. I just have to get them running in a circle and then

01:54:37.980 --> 01:54:39.980
And then when he does that, okay

01:54:43.660 --> 01:54:47.660
Some attacks are unblockable agro attacks

01:54:48.220 --> 01:54:53.900
Signaled by the agro symbol that appears above krill. Can you see it? Be sure to dodge run or jump out of the way

01:54:54.460 --> 01:54:56.460
Okay

01:54:57.660 --> 01:55:00.060
If it's parasocial we're all doing it to each other

01:55:02.060 --> 01:55:06.460
Can't escape para especially not in this industry you can knowledge. Yeah. Yeah

01:55:07.260 --> 01:55:10.620
Girls of great chemistry. We do I know like, um

01:55:13.820 --> 01:55:17.180
Some companies probably may not have that because some people like see

01:55:18.460 --> 01:55:24.620
That as like, uh, fuck hitting it. I mean with enough tech smack out the balance. We never know. We capsize now starts to flash

01:55:24.620 --> 01:55:26.620
Okay, so it's like a

01:55:27.580 --> 01:55:29.580
Okay

01:55:32.060 --> 01:55:34.060
Oh, please

01:55:34.060 --> 01:55:36.060
I

01:55:39.500 --> 01:55:41.500
Fucking up

01:55:42.620 --> 01:55:45.660
Oh, I like I don't know why the fuck

01:55:48.220 --> 01:55:50.220
That happened but it did

01:55:50.540 --> 01:55:53.020
Huh, I like the artwork. Okay. It's fine

01:55:54.460 --> 01:55:57.980
Now we know what to do. I think I was starting off while the freaking

01:55:59.340 --> 01:56:01.340
Dialogue boxes that just shy to show up

01:56:01.500 --> 01:56:07.020
Yeah, yeah, I got I got the strut I got the strut struts there struts all there

01:56:09.100 --> 01:56:11.100
All right, bitch

01:56:11.900 --> 01:56:13.900
Oh my god

01:56:15.900 --> 01:56:22.060
Oh, you want to come get this crap busty so bad. Oh my god, you want this crap busty?

01:56:24.460 --> 01:56:26.460
What the fuck was that?

01:56:26.540 --> 01:56:31.660
I see that. That was so weird. He just like jolted to the side a little bit

01:56:35.900 --> 01:56:43.180
Oh, okay, I did dodge in time. All right. I I'm pressing it when he's about to swing. So it's so weird to me

01:56:57.420 --> 01:56:59.740
Holy shit that flings me back. Okay

01:57:02.620 --> 01:57:04.620
Oh, no

01:57:05.180 --> 01:57:07.180
Please

01:57:07.980 --> 01:57:09.980
Oh, thank god

01:57:10.220 --> 01:57:12.220
The

01:57:24.380 --> 01:57:26.380
Oh, I thought I fucking

01:57:32.860 --> 01:57:34.860
My nose is a chief fuck

01:57:35.020 --> 01:57:37.020
I

01:57:39.820 --> 01:57:42.700
Why do I feel like I've done more damage than I actually have

01:57:54.460 --> 01:57:56.460
Oh, this is not a good show

01:58:01.980 --> 01:58:03.980
Oh fuck

01:58:04.860 --> 01:58:06.860
Oh

01:58:08.620 --> 01:58:10.620
Fuck

01:58:12.380 --> 01:58:17.660
Dude's giving you hella bot backshots. Yeah, not even the good good good way. This is a backshot roulette

01:58:22.700 --> 01:58:26.700
It's fun to be a little parasocial but as a viewer, I don't want to come off like I don't understand boundaries

01:58:26.940 --> 01:58:31.020
It's funny because tomorrow I have a drunk asmr stream and spoiler

01:58:31.260 --> 01:58:34.460
It's where I go take you on a date and I'm just really drunk

01:58:36.940 --> 01:58:38.940
So, uh, enjoy

01:58:41.340 --> 01:58:43.180
Because I'm a lonely

01:58:43.180 --> 01:58:44.700
wine hag

01:58:44.700 --> 01:58:50.220
In the role play I usually don't drink but I'm gonna go out and grab some stuff to make um some mixed drinks

01:58:51.020 --> 01:58:53.180
Uh, so if you fall in love with me tomorrow

01:58:54.380 --> 01:58:56.380
You can't tell about a bite of my lip

01:58:56.540 --> 01:58:58.060
It's okay

01:58:58.060 --> 01:59:00.060
I understand

01:59:01.500 --> 01:59:03.500
I

01:59:03.820 --> 01:59:10.140
Make a drink of choice. Uh, I prefer fruity drinks. Um, I went to this really awesome barbecue spot one time and they made a

01:59:11.740 --> 01:59:15.980
Uh, honey jack daniels with peach

01:59:17.340 --> 01:59:18.780
Uh

01:59:18.780 --> 01:59:20.380
juice and

01:59:20.380 --> 01:59:25.500
Fresh peaches and ice and then some other but they made like their own like peach iced tea

01:59:26.380 --> 01:59:30.700
And so I've been trying to replicate that for like the past year and it's so good

01:59:31.660 --> 01:59:33.660
The lobster just stays yell he be yelling

01:59:35.420 --> 01:59:38.540
He stay yelling junk on a Tuesday junk on a Tuesday afternoon

01:59:39.020 --> 01:59:42.540
It's gonna be four o'clock for me, but it's five o'clock somewhere. Am I right?

01:59:44.700 --> 01:59:47.100
All right, is it gonna do that weird shit again? I don't know

02:18:09.180 --> 02:18:10.940
Can I like

02:18:10.940 --> 02:18:12.460
Can I

02:18:12.460 --> 02:18:14.460
Wait, what was that?

02:18:17.900 --> 02:18:22.940
Okay, um, why do I feel like I can hook that but I don't know how

02:18:23.180 --> 02:18:28.300
The fuck am I supposed to get up there?

02:18:34.540 --> 02:18:40.620
Oh, not platforming. Oh not platforming my worst enemy

02:18:43.340 --> 02:18:47.660
Oh, what the fuck, you know a game I used to really love and this is reminding me of it a little bit

02:18:48.380 --> 02:18:51.100
Like bare minimum just because it's I'm like wall

02:18:52.060 --> 02:18:54.060
Running although wall crabbing

02:18:54.620 --> 02:18:57.420
Uh titanfall I fucking loved titanfall

02:18:58.220 --> 02:19:04.940
Play this shit out of titanfall. I wish I'm sorry, but fuck like I hate apex legends like I hate apex legends

02:19:06.140 --> 02:19:10.860
Apex legends took another titanfall away from me. Um, I like

02:19:11.500 --> 02:19:15.180
titanfall 1 and 2 I've played both I recently titanfall 2

02:19:15.900 --> 02:19:17.740
um

02:19:17.740 --> 02:19:19.820
And I really I like the plot of titanfall 1 though

02:19:21.180 --> 02:19:27.420
Timefall 2 had amazing. Yeah timefall 2 had amazing multiplayer and then I like destiny because destiny reminded me of titanfall

02:19:27.820 --> 02:19:29.820
And then destiny's gone to shit

02:19:30.700 --> 02:19:35.100
And like I put so many hours into destiny like I just played um

02:19:37.900 --> 02:19:40.940
I was playing recently like a little bit last year

02:19:42.060 --> 02:19:45.180
The not the recent like not the final shape

02:19:45.580 --> 02:19:47.580
But not the one before that one either

02:19:47.980 --> 02:19:53.500
Because I went in the game and I was just doing like the normal like I was replaying old plot and I'm like

02:19:54.540 --> 02:19:56.540
What the fuck happened to this game?

02:19:57.100 --> 02:20:00.220
You want me to pay 60 dollars to be able to use

02:20:01.820 --> 02:20:05.420
A dumb ass power like I was so irritated

02:20:08.060 --> 02:20:11.180
Not no, I will not bungee will never get my money

02:20:12.460 --> 02:20:17.100
I'm so tired like I I used to love overwatch. I loved overwatch

02:20:17.580 --> 02:20:18.780
But then

02:20:18.780 --> 02:20:25.100
Like this the loop box shit and the micro transactions and I'm like and then games are just being so

02:20:25.980 --> 02:20:32.140
Expensive for no you can't I wish you guys I need a 3d model because I'm very animated with my hands

02:20:32.220 --> 02:20:34.300
And you guys can't see how much I'm moving my hands

02:20:34.860 --> 02:20:36.620
um

02:20:36.620 --> 02:20:38.060
uh, but

02:20:38.060 --> 02:20:39.740
it's

02:20:39.740 --> 02:20:44.460
I just get so far I'm like, why do you want me to pay this much money to play a game that's already out?

02:20:44.540 --> 02:20:46.540
It's just a dlc and it's 60 bucks

02:20:47.740 --> 02:20:52.300
The only excuse I'd give that to is elden ring. I don't know how I don't know how much elden ring

02:20:53.260 --> 02:20:55.260
Erie tree one is gonna be though

02:20:56.220 --> 02:21:01.180
No fans, but they said destiny 2 would get its root back last three. Yeah, no that that game is

02:21:02.380 --> 02:21:05.260
Shit shite fellow hand talker, of course

02:21:06.380 --> 02:21:08.540
Oh what the fuck look at this little animation

02:21:10.700 --> 02:21:12.700
That's so adorable

02:21:15.340 --> 02:21:18.220
What the hell um

02:21:20.220 --> 02:21:22.220
Oh

02:21:22.860 --> 02:21:26.060
Wait, can I can I have that?

02:21:29.660 --> 02:21:31.660
I'm a balder skate

02:21:34.620 --> 02:21:36.620
Like it's weird because

02:21:37.260 --> 02:21:38.860
I

02:21:38.860 --> 02:21:40.860
love fantasy

02:21:41.260 --> 02:21:45.980
And I thought I would really like balder's gate

02:21:46.620 --> 02:21:50.860
I've never played balder's gate. I had never played diablo and I like diablo

02:21:51.900 --> 02:21:54.300
I'm usually not good at like or like

02:21:55.900 --> 02:21:59.980
Not like not good, but I don't like turn-based games. I realize

02:22:00.540 --> 02:22:02.060
um

02:22:02.060 --> 02:22:07.980
In like party management and like I like the story like if I could just run around like a skyrim and just like

02:22:08.060 --> 02:22:15.660
Gang people that'd be cool. But I think because it wasn't what I like. I literally have balder's gate three sitting on my ps5

02:22:16.620 --> 02:22:20.060
Because I bought it and I played like three hours and I got nowhere

02:22:20.860 --> 02:22:25.340
And I'm like, when do I get to fuck a starion? Like I just want to fuck a starion

02:22:25.820 --> 02:22:27.420
the vampire dude

02:22:27.420 --> 02:22:30.940
Who apparently is the also the voice of hyzenberg?

02:22:31.580 --> 02:22:34.300
From a resident evil village. Hello

02:22:35.260 --> 02:22:37.260
What I'm playing on easy difficulty

02:22:38.540 --> 02:22:40.540
Uh, sorry about 20 20 77

02:22:43.340 --> 02:22:48.540
Yeah, sorry about 27 7 redeemed itself. Good great game. Great game pan am

02:22:49.260 --> 02:22:51.260
hell yeah

02:22:51.900 --> 02:22:55.900
Did can I have that? Oh fuck, you know what? Give me that

02:22:58.140 --> 02:23:00.140
I don't know where the fuck that came from

02:23:01.100 --> 02:23:03.100
But like

02:23:04.140 --> 02:23:06.140
I won't lie to you

02:23:06.700 --> 02:23:14.780
I love fps's, but I haven't played any like I haven't played cod or black ops and I haven't played um

02:23:16.060 --> 02:23:20.700
Valorant and I haven't played like because everything's just so different and I just

02:23:22.220 --> 02:23:23.820
I just can't

02:23:23.820 --> 02:23:28.220
Stand them anymore and I'm like because I played like I played counter strike. Um

02:23:30.460 --> 02:23:36.140
Oh, come on. I played the newest counter strike and I'm like, no this doesn't feel the same like I don't

02:23:36.940 --> 02:23:38.940
I don't like it

02:23:39.020 --> 02:23:41.020
It just felt whatever

02:23:42.860 --> 02:23:46.140
And everything I'd like it was like games used to be so much more simple

02:23:46.220 --> 02:23:51.340
But now with like skin like like oh like the counter strike definitely introduced like the concept of like

02:23:51.900 --> 02:23:54.940
skins and like it was literally its own little

02:23:56.140 --> 02:23:57.500
system

02:23:57.580 --> 02:24:03.020
Little stock market. I know that for a fact because I spent thousands of dollars on stuff, but yeah

02:24:04.940 --> 02:24:06.940
Staring as the hardest romance

02:24:07.180 --> 02:24:09.100
Difficulty just track through one

02:24:09.100 --> 02:24:13.900
But I pretty sure I had it on easy mode because I like usually I'll play a game on easy mode

02:24:14.060 --> 02:24:16.220
I'm not afraid. I'll say it. I'm a little bitch

02:24:16.780 --> 02:24:21.260
Um when it comes to games that I don't know so I'll usually play stuff on that

02:24:21.260 --> 02:24:23.260
That

02:24:23.580 --> 02:24:27.100
It caused generational trauma to my imaginary fit. What?

02:24:29.580 --> 02:24:35.420
My friend group more like half-life pvp enjoyers to gorgeous. Yeah, I never I played a lot of gary's mod

02:24:35.420 --> 02:24:37.920
I never played team fortress. I'll be honest with you

02:24:40.380 --> 02:24:44.380
I played so much trouble in terrorist town um and murder

02:24:45.900 --> 02:24:47.900
So I supposed to do this

02:24:48.940 --> 02:24:50.940
The fuck is that

02:24:51.660 --> 02:24:53.420
Dude

02:24:53.420 --> 02:24:55.420
I'm like pretty lost

02:25:01.660 --> 02:25:03.500
Oh

02:25:03.500 --> 02:25:06.860
Okay, let's start a piece of string. Amen. Oh, okay

02:25:07.980 --> 02:25:12.460
I was like, I see all these fish hooks. When am I gonna learn to like grapple?

02:25:12.460 --> 02:25:21.020
Okay, well, I don't know where to go though

02:25:29.980 --> 02:25:31.980
Am I too far away?

02:25:33.820 --> 02:25:35.820
What the hell

02:25:37.420 --> 02:25:39.420
The fuck am I doing?

02:25:39.500 --> 02:25:41.500
Oh

02:25:41.740 --> 02:25:46.220
How was it watching she be? Oh, yeah, she was like stuck platforming for like

02:25:47.420 --> 02:25:49.420
An hour. It was great

02:25:50.620 --> 02:25:52.860
All right, do I need more string? I don't

02:25:55.180 --> 02:25:57.180
Should I just kill myself in minecraft?

02:26:04.140 --> 02:26:06.940
Oh my god, hello

02:26:06.940 --> 02:26:08.940
What

02:26:15.740 --> 02:26:18.780
The fuck dude it would have let me go up

02:26:21.020 --> 02:26:23.020
I hate it here

02:26:32.940 --> 02:26:34.940
I think it's because I need a snack and I'm getting grumpy

02:26:37.020 --> 02:26:39.020
Oh

02:26:43.020 --> 02:26:45.020
Don't do this to me again

02:26:47.420 --> 02:26:51.180
What what is that if why wouldn't let me just go up straight

02:26:54.860 --> 02:27:02.220
Getting angry maybe so this is gonna make matter race platform. Oh, no, it's literally always the platforming the platforming pisses me off

02:27:07.420 --> 02:27:09.420
Can I

02:27:23.740 --> 02:27:28.860
Oh, that's cute it's like a uh medallion badge thingy

02:27:31.740 --> 02:27:33.740
That's real cute

02:27:33.900 --> 02:27:37.340
It's an adaptation

02:27:39.580 --> 02:27:41.740
I'm guessing those are powers

02:27:43.500 --> 02:27:46.780
He's so cute what the fuck

02:27:50.780 --> 02:27:52.780
All right, Blake

02:27:54.860 --> 02:27:56.860
Is that the only thing I need

02:28:04.220 --> 02:28:06.220
Oh

02:28:11.500 --> 02:28:13.820
Listen it takes me a while to figure out objectives

02:28:20.060 --> 02:28:22.460
Can I why doesn't it let me go?

02:28:30.460 --> 02:28:32.460

02:28:42.300 --> 02:28:44.300
Okay, all right

Because I'm like I don't know if something's a bug or if it's a feature

02:28:59.260 --> 02:29:01.260
Ow

02:29:04.700 --> 02:29:08.220

That was not supposed to be the mechanic to get up there

02:37:01.180 --> 02:37:04.460
It was supposed to go by so I could walk up

02:37:07.500 --> 02:37:09.500
Oh my god

02:37:10.780 --> 02:37:13.500
This game's killing me, but in a good way. I like it

02:37:14.460 --> 02:37:18.460
Oh shell, are you okay? I can't believe I dropped it. I'm so stupid

02:37:19.500 --> 02:37:22.220
I one job and it was oh, it's your fucking fault

02:37:25.580 --> 02:37:32.140
Yeah, he he we had a date and he fucking stood me up your captain we were supposed to battle and you just left

02:37:34.620 --> 02:37:39.420
Skip the boss we get slowed down on the stairs, but then it just oh my god, I can

02:37:40.380 --> 02:37:42.380
I

02:37:42.940 --> 02:37:46.540
Was so like I was so ready to fight that boss too. I'm so mad

02:37:47.820 --> 02:37:50.380
But I'm like happy, but I'm mad. Was that a marshmallow?

02:37:51.740 --> 02:37:53.740
Do I get a little hat?

02:37:56.780 --> 02:37:59.580
You're telling me I could put this on my booty cheek, but

02:38:01.420 --> 02:38:03.420
Am I got that cut pussy?

02:38:04.460 --> 02:38:07.900
But um, but I couldn't wear that snail shell

02:38:09.420 --> 02:38:11.420
Barnacle

02:38:11.980 --> 02:38:13.980
Oh, that's cool

02:38:15.020 --> 02:38:18.300
Damn you get on a lot of stowaways right off the bat. I wonder if that's normal

02:38:19.340 --> 02:38:21.340
Oh, okay

02:38:21.660 --> 02:38:28.300
It's for attack vitality. Oh, I see how that works and then you can get more and promote. I'm oh, I didn't mean to do that

02:38:29.900 --> 02:38:31.900
Ooh

02:38:33.500 --> 02:38:35.900
Oh, okay, so it's either one or two in this and that

02:38:37.340 --> 02:38:39.340
defense

02:38:39.820 --> 02:38:41.820
I'll do that. Yeah

02:38:42.540 --> 02:38:44.300
Doesn't uh

02:38:44.300 --> 02:38:47.100
I need to go to a moon shell. What the fuck

02:38:48.140 --> 02:38:50.140
What is this?

02:38:50.220 --> 02:38:52.940
Drop I don't want to drop. Where am I dropping?

02:38:55.260 --> 02:38:58.380
Did you say something to me hand-pressed and then make it a bit as interesting as I were

02:39:00.060 --> 02:39:02.060
Can you be favorite?

02:39:02.780 --> 02:39:04.780
Yeah, sure thing chicken wing

02:39:05.580 --> 02:39:07.580
What's that do

02:39:08.540 --> 02:39:10.540
Now we're gaming

02:39:10.780 --> 02:39:12.780
Gotta go. Oh, of course. Bye

02:39:15.100 --> 02:39:18.380
If you guys you leave you to watch how cute Emmy is totally understand

02:39:18.460 --> 02:39:21.900
She might be like looking some of your ears right now or something. I think she's ASMR today

02:39:24.140 --> 02:39:25.660
Oh

02:39:25.660 --> 02:39:27.660
So that's the re oh

02:39:27.660 --> 02:39:29.660
Okay, so if I fall I climb up

02:39:30.220 --> 02:39:32.220
So if I didn't drop that I

02:39:32.220 --> 02:39:34.220
would just be fucked I

02:39:34.380 --> 02:39:36.380
presume

02:39:42.940 --> 02:39:44.940
All right, all right

02:39:46.940 --> 02:39:48.940
We're here we're vibing

02:39:51.180 --> 02:39:54.220
I feel like if I touch that it's bad. So I'm not gonna

02:39:54.460 --> 02:39:56.460
I

02:40:00.700 --> 02:40:04.940
Must be like oil wait, what's that there's cool stuff up there

02:40:06.700 --> 02:40:08.860
I mean down there. I'm sorry

02:40:11.100 --> 02:40:13.100
Excuse you

02:40:14.620 --> 02:40:16.620
Give me your micro plastics

02:40:17.740 --> 02:40:20.540
Oh, I wonder if I can just like jump down

02:40:21.180 --> 02:40:23.180
I probably can

02:40:23.180 --> 02:40:26.940
I'm tempted but then I have to do all this shit again, but I don't really care too much

02:40:38.860 --> 02:40:40.860
What that

02:40:45.580 --> 02:40:47.580
I don't know what the shell means

02:40:51.020 --> 02:40:53.020
Oh, it's pretty cool

02:40:53.660 --> 02:40:55.660
Oh

02:40:55.900 --> 02:40:57.900
Can I like

02:40:59.740 --> 02:41:01.740
Oh, I thought I could like

02:41:03.100 --> 02:41:05.100
The fuck I wasn't locked on

02:41:06.460 --> 02:41:08.460
Can I have that?

02:41:08.460 --> 02:41:10.460
Ew, I don't know what that does

02:41:11.900 --> 02:41:14.220
I'm more into drunken bunny ASMR

02:41:16.380 --> 02:41:18.780
You're just gonna see how much of a babbling idiot I get

02:41:21.100 --> 02:41:23.100
Is there

02:41:23.180 --> 02:41:26.140
Is that where the cave is supposed to be I thought or is that someone else

02:41:27.740 --> 02:41:32.540
An effort to recover his home the plucky hermit crab ventures to a mysterious cave

02:41:33.580 --> 02:41:37.500
But he quickly discovers that return journey will be significantly more challenging

02:41:38.540 --> 02:41:42.540
Hello, who's talking he approaches the ghostly figure in front of him

02:41:46.620 --> 02:41:48.620
I like that

02:41:49.580 --> 02:41:54.060
I'll be different from now me good. Hey, let me just

02:41:55.820 --> 02:41:57.820
And then getting banned

02:42:02.860 --> 02:42:04.860
Oh shit

02:42:13.260 --> 02:42:17.260
Well, I have the nail so I already have a tack up. Okay. I'm good for now. Yeah

02:42:18.940 --> 02:42:25.740
Or I can put because I got a small but the can can get hit so

02:42:26.620 --> 02:42:29.580
Yeah, that's fine. Oh, you're so cute

02:42:35.660 --> 02:42:37.660
Who's talking

02:42:38.620 --> 02:42:42.540
Hi, um, my name's krill. Do you know anything shiny in this cave?

02:42:43.260 --> 02:42:46.620
Something that might like impress a huge beautiful crab lady

02:42:46.860 --> 02:42:48.060
Yeah

02:42:48.060 --> 02:42:51.740
Confused and desperate the hermit crab begins begging help from strangers

02:42:52.940 --> 02:42:54.780
Hey, I'm not desperate

02:42:54.780 --> 02:42:55.980
yet

02:42:55.980 --> 02:43:00.940
Thus far he is preserved persevered by taking refuge in artifacts from beyond the waves

02:43:01.580 --> 02:43:06.220
But to survive here from here on out. He must awaken the currents inside of him

02:43:07.340 --> 02:43:10.460
He must access the power of

02:43:11.500 --> 02:43:13.500
a mommy

02:43:14.460 --> 02:43:16.460
A mommy

02:43:17.020 --> 02:43:19.020
Mommy, sorry

02:43:19.420 --> 02:43:21.420
You know the voice acting crazy in this game

02:43:22.860 --> 02:43:25.260
I mean drunk funny content and some of the best

02:43:25.900 --> 02:43:27.900
I'm looking at a bite. I'm looking at a bite

02:43:30.140 --> 02:43:31.980
Wiggles eyebrows

02:43:31.980 --> 02:43:33.980
You mommy I'll stop

02:43:35.900 --> 02:43:40.540
Food wars rough should get out of here food wars is so weird. I'm like I

02:43:41.500 --> 02:43:46.620
I really like food related enemies and I was watching it and like I'll fall asleep to that

02:43:46.940 --> 02:43:51.020
But sometimes I'll like wake up and people will have their clothes off and I'm like

02:43:53.660 --> 02:43:55.660
Why am I

02:43:56.540 --> 02:43:58.540
Why

02:43:58.860 --> 02:44:00.860
Never I'm not gonna finish that joke

02:44:06.620 --> 02:44:08.140
What

02:44:08.140 --> 02:44:10.540
What the shell was that I feel tingly

02:44:11.740 --> 02:44:16.060
The hermit crab crab dawns a metal shell and feels a new ability awaken

02:44:17.420 --> 02:44:18.620
I do

02:44:18.620 --> 02:44:20.620
Yes, he does

02:44:21.740 --> 02:44:27.660
While wearing a shell press book to consume umami charges an evaporating new shell spell. Oh, that's cool

02:44:28.380 --> 02:44:30.380
Oh

02:44:32.460 --> 02:44:35.260
Shell shock or fizzle that's so cool

02:44:36.060 --> 02:44:38.060
Can I talk to you again?

02:44:38.060 --> 02:44:45.100
So what's this umami stuff exactly the hermit crab continues into the cavern excited to make the use of its new ability

02:44:46.540 --> 02:44:47.900
Uh

02:44:47.900 --> 02:44:49.900
This is like I'm not gonna fucking talk to you

02:44:49.980 --> 02:44:51.980
I

02:44:52.460 --> 02:44:59.180
Creature blocks the hermit crabs path immune to his physical attacks. It may only be dispatched by his newfound umami powers

02:45:00.300 --> 02:45:02.300
Well, isn't that convenient?

02:45:02.380 --> 02:45:06.380
The noble moons now denies any involvement in manufacturing the scenario

02:45:13.580 --> 02:45:17.260
How do I is it really seemed to me

02:45:20.060 --> 02:45:22.060
Oh when it touches me

02:45:25.500 --> 02:45:27.500
It just

02:45:30.860 --> 02:45:35.740
Oh, that kind of sucks actually it has it has to hit me to be affected

02:45:38.860 --> 02:45:43.500
The one's innocent hermit crabs ability to slaughter his enemies has increased dramatically

02:45:44.940 --> 02:45:46.940
Did you have to put it that way

02:45:47.740 --> 02:45:49.740
Your voice is so nice for how dorky you are

02:45:51.740 --> 02:45:54.940
You wanted a dummy mommy you got a fucking nerd

02:45:59.100 --> 02:46:02.220
Are you supposed to like charge the shell and then block? Oh

02:46:09.180 --> 02:46:13.420
My model's lagging, but you're probably right. It's probably probably blocking

02:46:14.380 --> 02:46:18.780
When I have my controller plugged in I have to have run my model off of my wi-fi and so

02:46:20.140 --> 02:46:22.140
I'm gonna move in slow motion for a bit

02:46:26.540 --> 02:46:30.060
He senses that the reward he seeks lies further within this cavern

02:46:30.780 --> 02:46:36.380
As well as the opportunity to meet his newfound idol the mysterious and attractive moons now in the flesh

02:46:38.540 --> 02:46:40.540
Guess I have no choice

02:46:44.380 --> 02:46:47.900
I kind of wish I gave the moonsail a dorkier voice than like a hot

02:46:49.740 --> 02:46:53.580
Lady voice pop off interesting

02:47:01.660 --> 02:47:07.420
Keeping the shelf for now because of the defense, but I do want to oh look at the sea anemone anemone

02:47:10.060 --> 02:47:12.060
um

02:47:12.140 --> 02:47:14.620
He can just to play around the stuff. Ooh

02:47:15.900 --> 02:47:17.900
Don't fall into the abyss

02:47:19.180 --> 02:47:21.180
Can I okay

02:47:25.420 --> 02:47:33.500
Sometimes I keep pressing l1 sort of I don't like that it does that that it sometimes it gets stuck and doesn't climb up

02:47:38.300 --> 02:47:40.300
And I have to wiggle around

02:47:42.460 --> 02:47:44.460
Whoa

02:47:51.260 --> 02:47:54.380
Why am I getting beat up by this stupid thing

02:47:58.220 --> 02:48:00.220
Eep

02:48:01.900 --> 02:48:04.540
Oh, it's on the games. I like it. I like it

02:48:05.100 --> 02:48:10.060
Uh, you guys can let me know if you'd like me to continue this. Otherwise, I'll probably just like play by myself

02:48:11.020 --> 02:48:13.020
If you guys like watching this

02:48:17.020 --> 02:48:20.140
Me trying to dumbly figure out a game

02:48:22.940 --> 02:48:24.940
What the hell

02:48:26.940 --> 02:48:28.940
Hmm

02:48:31.100 --> 02:48:33.100
Do I want to try to get over there

02:48:34.060 --> 02:48:37.980
Because I'm just gonna get caught. Yeah, I'm just gonna get caught in a stupid net weird net bug

02:48:38.860 --> 02:48:40.860
All right

02:48:41.100 --> 02:48:43.100
I'm coming for you

02:48:46.380 --> 02:48:49.420
I'm pressing the wrong. Oh god. Oh god

02:48:59.660 --> 02:49:03.100
Abraced r2 again instead of r1

02:49:04.060 --> 02:49:06.060
I

02:49:07.740 --> 02:49:09.740
Whoopsies

02:49:12.060 --> 02:49:14.060
What's that

02:49:15.580 --> 02:49:18.220
Oh the charges my umami question mark

02:49:23.740 --> 02:49:25.740
Wait

02:49:27.820 --> 02:49:30.540
Can I guess I can

02:49:33.100 --> 02:49:35.100
I

02:49:42.060 --> 02:49:44.060
Don't need to fight you

02:49:44.140 --> 02:49:50.060
Oh, I see there's like little parts where I actually can't climb up. What the hell

02:49:54.220 --> 02:49:56.220
That was a weird ass noise that crab man

02:49:58.140 --> 02:50:00.940
The animation for the grappling is pretty pretty sick

02:50:03.980 --> 02:50:08.140
Okay, that makes a lot more sense now because I'm like, why can't I wait, but I just did it right now

02:50:09.020 --> 02:50:11.020
I'm confused

02:50:16.060 --> 02:50:18.060
Oh

02:50:34.060 --> 02:50:36.060
What the fuck just happened

02:50:47.500 --> 02:50:49.500
I'm so confused

02:50:59.340 --> 02:51:01.740
I just fell into nothing twice

02:51:02.540 --> 02:51:04.540
I thought it was gonna drop me

02:51:05.020 --> 02:51:07.020
Back at the moon

02:51:09.980 --> 02:51:16.220
That was so weird and then the can fell that I had I wanted to have two cans up there just in case

02:51:18.140 --> 02:51:20.140
Oh my god, I don't

02:51:21.180 --> 02:51:25.740
And I have to use a stupid shell shock one. All right. Come on, bitch

02:51:26.300 --> 02:51:28.300
Oh

02:51:35.820 --> 02:51:39.740
Look at me. Look at me. I am de-captain now. I am de-captain now

02:51:41.820 --> 02:51:43.820
Get absolutely fucked

02:51:47.020 --> 02:51:49.020
What is that is that a button

02:51:49.820 --> 02:51:56.060
He's not gonna be a crab game too. That's for sure. I can tell you that sugar

02:51:57.900 --> 02:51:59.900
I thought of the

02:52:00.300 --> 02:52:03.580
Hold on now. I have to look it up the Pedro Pascal. Oh shit

02:52:04.380 --> 02:52:07.900
The fucking okay the Pedro Pascal thing

02:52:19.180 --> 02:52:21.180
Oh

02:52:26.540 --> 02:52:31.980
Yes, this one this freaking tiktok can I please play it?

02:52:36.620 --> 02:52:38.620
I don't want to log into tiktok

02:52:40.940 --> 02:52:43.180
No, where's the where's the thirst cam?

02:52:45.820 --> 02:52:47.820
Is this it

02:52:49.340 --> 02:52:51.340
Oh

02:53:10.540 --> 02:53:12.540
I need to learn that line

02:53:12.620 --> 02:53:17.740
So you can scream my name as loud as you need to sugar. I think that would be good just like a

02:53:18.700 --> 02:53:20.700
Southern mommy dom's you

02:53:22.380 --> 02:53:26.860
You can ride me and scream my name, you know, I think that'd be pretty nice

02:53:33.100 --> 02:53:40.940
Do that for a patreon audio I have a an ASMR script I have like lying around that's just um

02:53:42.620 --> 02:53:44.620
Wait, can I

02:53:47.900 --> 02:53:49.900
Oh

03:02:10.860 --> 03:02:17.500
Like besides like obviously in like my patreon. I could be like get on your knees and take the strap but like

03:02:18.620 --> 03:02:20.620
If I'm playing a game

03:02:20.860 --> 03:02:22.860
like another crab stretcher

03:02:24.700 --> 03:02:26.700
I want to be like

03:02:27.660 --> 03:02:29.660

03:02:48.060 --> 03:02:50.060
Get on your knees

03:02:50.060 --> 03:02:52.060

03:03:46.620 --> 03:03:48.060
pay

03:03:48.060 --> 03:03:50.060
To have me do stuff

03:03:50.540 --> 03:03:51.980
like oh

03:03:51.980 --> 03:03:53.660

03:03:53.660 --> 03:04:00.700
Five dollars I can gag she be for five minutes and she has to put the bell gag on or um

03:04:01.660 --> 03:04:03.660
Uh

03:04:03.660 --> 03:04:04.620
I know that's like subby

03:04:04.620 --> 03:04:08.300
But I think it's funny because then I can try to talk with it on and then try to keep streaming

03:04:08.780 --> 03:04:13.180
Um, and then for the crop I could just I don't know saw my ass with it

03:04:13.180 --> 03:04:14.780
I don't know if I'd be allowed to do that on youtube

03:04:15.100 --> 03:04:18.540
I meant slap my hand because that's what I'm doing right now

03:04:20.460 --> 03:04:22.460
Slapping my hand play blood born

03:04:23.100 --> 03:04:28.300
I want to play blood born, but I don't have a capture card. I mean, I totally have a capture card. What are you talking about?

03:04:29.580 --> 03:04:31.580
um

03:04:31.580 --> 03:04:39.260
Like twitcher deems. Yeah, like because what I miss about twi- like I really liked redeems. I hope at some point that youtube

03:04:40.140 --> 03:04:41.740
does

03:04:41.820 --> 03:04:43.980
Something similar because that'd be fun

03:04:44.700 --> 03:04:49.660
Um, honestly, you're doing great. It feels like you've already become comfortable in your new skin dealing with us. Yeah streaming

03:04:49.740 --> 03:04:54.780
I I could easily like streaming is so fun. I love streaming. It's not hard for me to stream

03:04:54.780 --> 03:04:59.580
It's not hard for me to yap and talk at you. I'm not like I could be a shy person on my hand is red from

03:05:00.540 --> 03:05:02.540
slapping this um

03:05:03.340 --> 03:05:09.020
But uh, that's usually like outside of streaming and in streaming I can be

03:05:09.580 --> 03:05:11.580
I feel like I'm more myself when I'm streaming

03:05:12.300 --> 03:05:16.060
um, so I like I I take the opportunity during streams to beat myself

03:05:17.020 --> 03:05:19.900
And I hope youtube gives this gumbo currency

03:05:23.100 --> 03:05:27.740
Streams of jjk chapter leaks. I don't know what that is

03:05:28.940 --> 03:05:33.260
You're very active while playing games. It's hard youtube is engine the way to be a streamer folks

03:05:33.500 --> 03:05:37.340
Yeah, which is nice and they're doing like I don't like tick-tock related shit with like the forts and stuff

03:05:37.980 --> 03:05:42.780
um, I haven't put it on any more shorts because again, we want to be able to put ads

03:05:43.260 --> 03:05:45.260
I'm not ads, but like run

03:05:45.260 --> 03:05:47.260
put money into them

03:05:47.260 --> 03:05:50.060
but they keep getting nuked because of my

03:05:52.140 --> 03:06:00.220
My uh, yeah, so I don't know if I'll be able to get monetization or my first few streams might be demonetized because of my

03:06:01.100 --> 03:06:02.300
bitties

03:06:02.300 --> 03:06:04.300
I don't know I could be totally wrong

03:06:08.300 --> 03:06:10.300
I

03:06:10.860 --> 03:06:13.100
Like that a leash has physics

03:06:13.980 --> 03:06:18.540
Are you a good puppy or are you a bad puppy because if you're a bad puppy

03:06:21.900 --> 03:06:28.620
I don't know if you'll like it when you know, you're a bad puppy. I'm not hitting you with this. It's going up your ass

03:06:29.260 --> 03:06:31.260

Mimi ASMR is I definitely want to do some of those

03:13:18.300 --> 03:13:23.820

03:13:39.900 --> 03:13:41.740

03:13:41.740 --> 03:13:46.380
I grew up drawing a lot and learning a lot about art history

03:13:46.860 --> 03:13:52.380
And I just love the human form. And so I've just admired all parts of the human form

03:13:53.020 --> 03:13:55.020

03:13:55.020 --> 03:14:00.060
Uh, women are beautiful. Men are beautiful and handsome women are handsome. They're just nice

03:14:00.700 --> 03:14:02.700

I actually don't tell people that you guys you guys are in the know

03:14:12.300 --> 03:14:16.700
I don't tell people that I usually keep it by myself because some some people tend to make it a whole

03:14:17.660 --> 03:14:19.660
character trait

03:14:20.460 --> 03:14:25.420
That doesn't need to be one clavicle. Oh, I love me a good some good collar bones

So like

03:15:29.740 --> 03:15:31.580

03:15:31.580 --> 03:15:33.260

03:15:33.340 --> 03:15:35.340
And I can miss you guys

03:15:35.980 --> 03:15:37.980

past my normal time

03:15:41.980 --> 03:15:43.980
because I like

03:15:43.980 --> 03:15:45.980

03:15:46.540 --> 03:15:49.980
Sorry, the the bun speak um came out

Love the crazy cat lady. Woo crazy cat lady asmr would be good. I like that

03:15:59.180 --> 03:16:03.020
British kids you just like a like a chop like

03:16:03.980 --> 03:16:06.780
Just like a london herb heavily bronze

03:16:07.500 --> 03:16:09.500
Just shakes you

03:16:09.740 --> 03:16:14.300
That's so funny. Oh, yeah, I was I was like I was talking to my parents

03:16:15.260 --> 03:16:18.860
I like oh, how you doing? I'm like, I'm good. Now. I'm like thinking about getting another cat

03:16:19.740 --> 03:16:24.060
And my parents are like why and I'm like, I don't know. I'm feeling more lonely and they're like you already have three

03:16:24.060 --> 03:16:26.780
What's it gonna be? I'm like, I don't know. So like I got

03:16:27.660 --> 03:16:31.580
Boomi so reina could have a friend and then reina hated boomi. So then I got

03:16:32.140 --> 03:16:34.140
Fia so boomi could have a friend

03:16:34.460 --> 03:16:39.660
But Fia also hates boomi because he's a menace to society. Well, she doesn't hate them. They actually love each other very much

03:16:40.220 --> 03:16:46.140
Um, he just likes to chase her around and sniff her ass too much. That's kind of annoying for um, and I'm like, maybe

03:16:46.780 --> 03:16:51.500
Fia needs a friend, you know, like everybody needs friends. Everybody needs friends

03:16:54.140 --> 03:16:57.180
Don't say a poor boomi boomi like what do you do the other day? He

03:16:58.460 --> 03:17:02.860
Fucking attacked my feet. I was like I got out of the shower and he

03:17:03.420 --> 03:17:07.980
Has this weird thing where he likes to be held right after I shower. I don't know why he does that

03:17:07.980 --> 03:17:12.380
I'm like, oh, maybe he wants me to smell like him or something and he gets really snuggly and purry

03:17:13.340 --> 03:17:18.140
So I'll hold him a bit and then I put him down. He got mad and he started attacking my ankles

03:17:20.700 --> 03:17:22.700
Everyone needs a friend

03:17:23.500 --> 03:17:27.900
Yeah, and you won't be sleeping, chilling, eating. I'm surprised they're not like running a muck right now

03:17:29.100 --> 03:17:34.780
Boomi, boomi isn't a crate. I I had to put Fia in a crate for a long time because um

03:17:35.500 --> 03:17:38.940
Boomi would try to pounce on her and play with her when she couldn't walk

03:17:39.580 --> 03:17:43.420
And so um, I had to for her safety just put her in a crate

03:17:43.420 --> 03:17:46.380
But now boomi and reina and fia just like sleeping in it

03:17:47.180 --> 03:17:52.140
I didn't know I could crate train a cat, but I crate trained a cat. They're actually all crate trains. So

03:17:53.100 --> 03:17:58.540
Cats are really pretty cool. But I like dogs too. I always want like when I get my own house eventually

03:17:59.500 --> 03:18:01.500
um save up and all that stuff

03:18:02.140 --> 03:18:04.140
off my debts

03:18:04.220 --> 03:18:08.300
Um my house I want to get dogs. I really like great piranhas

03:18:09.020 --> 03:18:13.740
They're so big and I want to get some like because great piranhas are livestock guardian dogs

03:18:14.380 --> 03:18:16.380
and I would like to um

03:18:17.180 --> 03:18:24.140
Get some like chickens and goats for the dog to protect and my friend told like taught not told

03:18:24.460 --> 03:18:28.140
Taught me but she tells me how she makes like candles from goat's milk

03:18:28.780 --> 03:18:33.500
And her candles smell fucking amazing because she does like those like farmers markets and stuff

03:18:34.940 --> 03:18:37.660
And I'm like yo what doggie brings you like I like big dogs

03:18:39.340 --> 03:18:42.060
Small dogs are yappy. I used to be obsessed with huskies

03:18:43.740 --> 03:18:49.740
Cats are cats territorial. Oh, yeah, not really like it really depends. Go smell because they're mentioned

03:18:51.420 --> 03:18:52.780
um

03:18:52.780 --> 03:18:53.980
I like

03:18:53.980 --> 03:18:59.020
I remember I really like feral hounds. I also really like coon hounds like hound dogs. Um

03:19:00.780 --> 03:19:06.540
One of my close friends recently had a hound dog that passed and I loved him so much his name was copper

03:19:06.620 --> 03:19:08.380
He would be like

03:19:08.380 --> 03:19:12.540
He was a sweetheart. Um, I usually I usually don't like um

03:19:13.740 --> 03:19:15.740
hound dogs, but

03:19:15.820 --> 03:19:22.380
He won me over with his floppy ears and his like he would like almost like purr like a cat when you pet him

03:19:23.980 --> 03:19:25.980
He would just be like, um

03:19:26.620 --> 03:19:28.620
He just pet him. He's like

03:19:28.620 --> 03:19:30.620
It was funny

03:19:31.100 --> 03:19:34.140
Yeah, he was he was a nice old man that old boy

03:19:35.020 --> 03:19:36.540
um

03:19:36.540 --> 03:19:38.540
sweet sweet boy, uh

03:19:39.420 --> 03:19:40.860
and

03:19:40.860 --> 03:19:44.700
I also want to get a dog because again, like I said, I'm a woman who lives alone

03:19:44.780 --> 03:19:50.140
So I would like scary dog privilege for when I go on walks and stuff because I I don't usually I hate

03:19:50.460 --> 03:19:56.700
I also have really bad anxiety going outside. Uh, like I said, I was a gore phobic at one point and I feel like if I had a dog

03:19:57.580 --> 03:19:59.740
It would be I would have a lot more

03:20:00.620 --> 03:20:02.620
confidence

03:20:02.620 --> 03:20:09.660
A dog named copper as well. He's rich back. Oh, yeah rich back religion rich bags. Uh, I have the weird talent of being able to

03:20:11.020 --> 03:20:13.900
Look at a dog and almost guess it's breed exactly

03:20:14.860 --> 03:20:21.500
Because I used to my grandfather got me a dog book a book of dog breeds when I was younger. So I'm very good at um

03:20:22.540 --> 03:20:28.940
Identifying rough area. Uh, where I used I like I moved down to my parents house. Um, that was a rougher area

03:20:30.140 --> 03:20:32.300
Somebody got decapitated like a block away

03:20:33.980 --> 03:20:38.460
That was crazy and a kid got stabbed in the butt in my high school. Um, but

03:20:39.260 --> 03:20:40.380
Uh

03:20:40.380 --> 03:20:43.580
Where I am now it's a little bit better, but people are rowdy

03:20:45.020 --> 03:20:47.020
And excuse me. Yeah

03:20:47.580 --> 03:20:49.580
It's crazy out here. He's crazy

03:20:50.220 --> 03:20:53.740
Um, yeah, some kid that was like gang violence got stabbed in the ass. Um

03:20:55.420 --> 03:20:57.420
And that's good

03:20:57.580 --> 03:21:01.100
But I think yeah, I remember I was looking into like dobermans for a long time

03:21:01.420 --> 03:21:05.100
Because I was like and then I was like, oh, how much would like an actual

03:21:05.820 --> 03:21:07.820
guard dog be

03:21:07.980 --> 03:21:09.980
They're like $40,000 and I'm like

03:21:11.420 --> 03:21:12.780
What?

03:21:12.780 --> 03:21:14.780
Uh, I used to work at a dog kennel

03:21:15.580 --> 03:21:17.900
for um protected protective dogs

03:21:18.380 --> 03:21:24.940
I hate I only lasted a week because the the way they treated the dogs was terrible. I reported them to um authorities to like, um

03:21:26.060 --> 03:21:29.340
Animal control and all that stuff because they were a hundred percent

03:21:30.300 --> 03:21:34.300
of using the dogs with uh shot callers and other

03:21:34.860 --> 03:21:41.100
Methods to prop to improperly train them for for guard guard dogs a guard gone is only 530

03:21:41.100 --> 03:21:43.820
Yeah, I want to get my um my license as well for that

03:21:44.380 --> 03:21:48.460
I think it'd be cool imagine the IRL stream where I was taking to a gun range and I'm a good shot too

03:21:48.940 --> 03:21:54.940
You know when I was in camp I got a Davey Crockett award because I'm really good with airsoft rifle

03:21:57.900 --> 03:22:03.980
Um, but yeah, they had I love Belgian Malinois, um bellmells are so awesome. They're so smart

03:22:04.300 --> 03:22:10.940
You know like I I also want to be able to get a dog that I can work like I don't want to take a dog to get bite training

03:22:11.420 --> 03:22:12.220
um

03:22:12.220 --> 03:22:14.860
Take a yeah, take uh get a dog that can

03:22:16.060 --> 03:22:18.860
Like do agility courses and stuff. Um

03:22:19.580 --> 03:22:23.420
And they also had like a rottweiler. I think his name was huxley. He was such a sweet boy

03:22:23.500 --> 03:22:28.540
He was like, you're such a doofy little guy. I'm like, how are you gonna protect anybody? You're too sweet. Um

03:22:29.900 --> 03:22:31.900
And they also had a lot of german shepherds

03:22:32.140 --> 03:22:33.260
uh

03:22:33.260 --> 03:22:35.260
one of my

03:22:35.900 --> 03:22:37.020
co-workers

03:22:37.020 --> 03:22:40.860
Could I be your cart top? Sure. You guys are all my little my little dogs

03:22:41.660 --> 03:22:44.540
Put you on leashes and put those little puppy masks on you

03:22:45.660 --> 03:22:47.500
um

03:22:47.500 --> 03:22:55.420
One of my co-workers at that place another big reason why I left one they only lived in like five by six

03:22:56.380 --> 03:23:00.700
Kennels like it was so small kennels and that's where they were 24 seven

03:23:01.500 --> 03:23:07.980
Unless they were taken out to train and it was bad and they didn't get like walks. They didn't like I wasn't allowed to pet them

03:23:08.300 --> 03:23:09.820
couldn't pet the dogs

03:23:09.820 --> 03:23:10.780
um

03:23:10.780 --> 03:23:12.780
couldn't have any sort of

03:23:12.860 --> 03:23:14.380
interaction with them

03:23:14.380 --> 03:23:15.500
um

03:23:15.500 --> 03:23:21.260
I remember I was almost bit by this really beautiful black long-haired german shepherd calls called her miney when I was giving her her food

03:23:22.140 --> 03:23:25.660
She was like and I I know it's because they're trained to do that. They're trained to be

03:23:26.460 --> 03:23:30.540
Aggressive, but like it was just not the right way to go about it. Um

03:23:31.340 --> 03:23:33.340
I'm pretty hard to be horrified

03:23:33.420 --> 03:23:35.180
um

03:23:35.180 --> 03:23:40.140
But my we were taken one of the dogs slipped out of their kennel and

03:23:41.500 --> 03:23:43.500
Like I said, they're very aggressive

03:23:43.900 --> 03:23:46.860
I didn't say I left me. I was like correctly and he

03:23:47.980 --> 03:23:50.460
decided like a freaking asshole

03:23:51.340 --> 03:23:52.780
to um

03:23:52.780 --> 03:23:54.780
Hold on. I'm taking my cat mouth off because I'm

03:23:55.740 --> 03:23:58.460
frowning this guy was a piece of shit and I hope he's

03:23:59.740 --> 03:24:01.740
fucked up somewhere. Um

03:24:02.380 --> 03:24:05.020
he was egging the dog on and

03:24:05.820 --> 03:24:07.020
she

03:24:07.020 --> 03:24:10.300
Launched at him and tore up his sweatshirt, but his arm would have been gone

03:24:11.260 --> 03:24:13.100
uh

03:24:13.100 --> 03:24:15.820
Because he was just like trying that I was it was messed up

03:24:15.900 --> 03:24:19.580
I was so pissed off and then I reported the company reported that employee

03:24:20.140 --> 03:24:22.140
and I dipped um

03:24:22.300 --> 03:24:25.820
And you know how I said they lived in only like five by six things

03:24:26.220 --> 03:24:31.580
Uh, that's where they peed and they pooped and they ate and so my job was to go in and just clean their pee and their poop

03:24:31.660 --> 03:24:34.220
And so I always came home smelling like shit. My mom hated it

03:24:35.660 --> 03:24:40.780
I had to get special boots and I had like shock back all her piss and then pick up their dog. It was bad

03:24:41.340 --> 03:24:45.340
It was so bad. I hated it there. They're gone now. I'm so happy. They're gone

03:24:46.300 --> 03:24:48.300
I'm very passionate about animals

03:24:49.660 --> 03:24:53.500
I remember when I was younger I also wanted to be a wolf um conservationist and biologist

03:24:55.100 --> 03:24:56.700
and um

03:24:56.700 --> 03:24:58.700
run a wolf sanctuary

03:24:59.420 --> 03:25:01.580
and so, uh

03:25:01.580 --> 03:25:05.820
It's just like when like animals don't have the same

03:25:07.900 --> 03:25:14.620
Comprehension as humans and they deserve to be protected. Do they pay good? They did not I think I got paid like 12 dollars an hour

03:25:15.740 --> 03:25:17.740
Or less than that like nine dollars an hour

03:25:18.700 --> 03:25:20.220
um

03:25:20.220 --> 03:25:22.220
But yeah, I was

03:25:22.940 --> 03:25:27.900
I've had a lot of interesting jobs in my life. I know I was telling strani about one particular job

03:25:28.380 --> 03:25:30.380
That she's like, oh you have to tell

03:25:31.020 --> 03:25:33.020
You have to tell your stream about that

03:25:34.620 --> 03:25:38.220
And yeah, because I used to I used to be an intern for drama alert

03:25:40.140 --> 03:25:43.500
That's all I'll say though. That's all I'll say on it for now. Um

03:25:43.500 --> 03:25:45.500
um

03:25:45.740 --> 03:25:48.380
Let's get right into the news

03:25:49.260 --> 03:25:51.260
and

03:25:51.980 --> 03:25:56.540
That's crazy. Oh, yeah, you guys you guys don't know you guys don't know

03:25:57.900 --> 03:26:00.860
Um, if you weren't a bunny, what would you be instead?

03:26:02.620 --> 03:26:04.460
Does he know

03:26:04.460 --> 03:26:06.460
does he know

03:26:07.260 --> 03:26:11.980
Where you were hanging I wasn't hanging out with him. I was in a group chat with him on twitter

03:26:12.940 --> 03:26:17.580
My job as an intern really all right, uh go out scour the internet

03:26:18.300 --> 03:26:20.300
And tell him give me some stories

03:26:21.820 --> 03:26:24.780
And it was funny because I was also working with celestia vega at the time

03:26:24.940 --> 03:26:29.980
If you don't know who celeste vega is she was one of the zoeberger girls e-girls um

03:26:31.820 --> 03:26:33.340
And

03:26:33.340 --> 03:26:38.540
We would just I remember just chatting with her and we would just be like, uh, what about this news thing and she was just like

03:26:38.620 --> 03:26:42.380
I don't know. I'm gonna be like this news things doing what drama alert is good

03:26:43.820 --> 03:26:45.820
He don't need to know

03:26:46.060 --> 03:26:51.580
Um, oh my gosh, but oh, yeah, yeah, no, and he was uh very well connected to the commentary community

03:26:52.380 --> 03:26:54.380
very interesting place, uh

03:26:54.700 --> 03:26:57.820
It's when I first became a vtuber. I almost became

03:26:58.700 --> 03:27:00.700
a drama tuber

03:27:01.180 --> 03:27:03.180
But I

03:27:03.340 --> 03:27:05.580
I wanted and I probably actually might still do this

03:27:06.380 --> 03:27:09.340
Not be like report on news, but just um

03:27:10.780 --> 03:27:12.780
Do you like synopsis of

03:27:13.100 --> 03:27:14.540
creators

03:27:14.540 --> 03:27:16.860
Kind of like a like a I know I've been watching

03:27:17.420 --> 03:27:25.580
Uh, who was I watching recently? I like was recommended like a rima evan star even star video about like bow the whale

03:27:26.300 --> 03:27:27.020
um

03:27:27.020 --> 03:27:31.180
And what happened with that and I I just I was really I was like, oh, yeah

03:27:31.180 --> 03:27:34.380
Like that's exactly and that's the type of content that used to make was that sort of stuff

03:27:35.740 --> 03:27:39.900
If you don't know cook stars to stay that way gossiping stream, I wouldn't be so bad

03:27:39.980 --> 03:27:43.020
but like that's like I wouldn't I would only

03:27:43.900 --> 03:27:45.900
comment in like

03:27:46.220 --> 03:27:48.220
document

03:27:48.300 --> 03:27:50.300
Things that happened. I wouldn't

03:27:51.100 --> 03:27:55.420
Want to gossip because one I don't like gossip and it's kind of catty

03:27:56.620 --> 03:27:58.620
And I'm not one of those types of girls

03:27:59.660 --> 03:28:01.420
And I wouldn't want to

03:28:01.420 --> 03:28:06.460
Step on people's toes by being like, oh my god, there's person in eezy song you did

03:28:07.740 --> 03:28:10.060
And then like all that shit like that's just

03:28:10.780 --> 03:28:12.620
I'll leave that to false

03:28:12.620 --> 03:28:15.020
In the press new soggy whatever his name is

03:28:17.820 --> 03:28:22.940
Yeah, documentary documentary deep dive stuff. Yeah, like and you know like I

03:28:24.060 --> 03:28:27.740
You know, it's really funny the people who used to watch my commentary videos

03:28:28.220 --> 03:28:30.940
Um, we were like you should do ASMR

03:28:32.380 --> 03:28:35.900
Because I talked in a really wispy voice because I wasn't super confident

03:28:36.060 --> 03:28:42.460
So I'd be like this time in this community. I would just uh and some people are like, please I'm falling asleep

03:28:42.540 --> 03:28:44.540
But I'm also entertained

03:28:44.700 --> 03:28:46.700
Please do ASMR

03:28:47.500 --> 03:28:49.100
Surprise

03:28:49.100 --> 03:28:51.100
I'm doing ASMR

03:28:51.340 --> 03:28:53.340
I'm gonna be real hella respectful for that. Yeah, like

03:28:54.380 --> 03:28:57.660
I'm not like I'll like I won't lie to you. I watch those

03:28:58.540 --> 03:29:00.060
channels

03:29:00.060 --> 03:29:04.380
Can I be honest with you right now? Can I be can I be real with you? Let me get real close to

03:29:07.500 --> 03:29:09.900
I've only been a vtuber for

03:29:11.980 --> 03:29:13.660
Maybe

03:29:13.660 --> 03:29:15.660
Six or seven months now

03:29:16.220 --> 03:29:21.900
So I had to do a lot of research about the state of the community

03:29:22.540 --> 03:29:24.540
So I watched a lot of shitty

03:29:25.500 --> 03:29:28.620
Stuff I watched a lot of like drama

03:29:29.580 --> 03:29:32.700
Drama alert. I watched a lot of like drama tubers

03:29:33.420 --> 03:29:37.340
Um, I had to go back and figure out who the hell marushia was

03:29:37.900 --> 03:29:40.940
And why was everybody hating on her because she was dating so-and-so

03:29:41.660 --> 03:29:44.540
Like I I did a lot of research

03:29:45.340 --> 03:29:46.300
about

03:29:46.300 --> 03:29:49.900
The vtuber community prior to being a vtuber

03:29:50.220 --> 03:29:57.660
I always I watched vtubers like I would watch clips like I watched shy like I watched like the mainstream people like shy lily iron mouse

03:29:59.020 --> 03:30:02.940
Um, I watched them from time to time, but really just clips. I wouldn't sit and watch streams

03:30:03.740 --> 03:30:05.740
and um

03:30:05.820 --> 03:30:07.420
but

03:30:07.420 --> 03:30:12.140
So I did like a lot of freaking research. I don't know like strani was in my interview

03:30:12.220 --> 03:30:18.860
She was wary about hiring me for a second because she was confused because she's like you've only been a vtuber for five months

03:30:20.220 --> 03:30:22.380
How do you but why do you know so much?

03:30:23.260 --> 03:30:24.940
and I'm like

03:30:24.940 --> 03:30:27.900
Because I was a streamer for five years before that

03:30:28.380 --> 03:30:32.540
And I do a lot of research because I know how to do research and so I know a lot of stuff

03:30:34.780 --> 03:30:40.060
So I only have a couple months on strani for vtubing experience, but I love it. It's great

03:30:40.220 --> 03:30:44.220
I remember I tried vtubing back when it first popped off in 2019, but um

03:30:45.820 --> 03:30:47.820
I uh

03:30:48.620 --> 03:30:52.700
I yeah, I had like a v-royd model and I remember editing it. It was really fun

03:30:53.420 --> 03:30:55.980
I didn't even have like a character. I she just had a red hair

03:30:56.780 --> 03:31:01.260
And like maroon hair and like a purple outfit. I can't remember like tan skin or whatever

03:31:02.300 --> 03:31:03.580
um

03:31:03.580 --> 03:31:09.420
I dived into the matrix during oh, yeah. No, I do my research. I like to be educated like when something happens

03:31:09.500 --> 03:31:16.620
I'm immediately researching it. So like for example, that's a reman even star even star. I don't know perhaps her name um video

03:31:17.340 --> 03:31:19.260
I was like

03:31:19.260 --> 03:31:24.220
I didn't I haven't watched it yet. I saw the thumbnail and I'm like, oh looks like I have to go back in time and research

03:31:24.300 --> 03:31:29.980
on what this was. So I watched like several different videos and looked at different um tweets and was like, huh interesting

03:31:31.260 --> 03:31:35.900
I'm a secure. I'm just someone who just loves absorbing information and um

03:31:36.780 --> 03:31:43.100
Vtubing is definitely one of my special interests. So I will hyper fixie and try to learn everything there is about it. Um

03:31:43.660 --> 03:31:45.660
Yes, I was before this

03:31:45.660 --> 03:31:52.300
Yeah, I had so in order to apply to be a lurid you had to have um some sort of experience of streaming under your belt

03:31:52.940 --> 03:31:54.780
um

03:31:54.780 --> 03:31:55.820
and

03:31:55.820 --> 03:32:00.940
The scrawny preferred a long lengthier amount of time and in my interview that's when I was like, oh, I actually

03:32:01.020 --> 03:32:04.220
I've streamed five years before that. I've been in content creation for longer

03:32:05.180 --> 03:32:07.500
But yeah, but I I went down that rabbit hole

03:32:08.220 --> 03:32:09.340
um

03:32:09.340 --> 03:32:11.820
But yeah, I like I love deep diving on the internet. Um

03:32:12.780 --> 03:32:17.180
Another thing I'm just I they don't they don't know this. I'm just like mercy. I am a

03:32:19.180 --> 03:32:21.180
Allude ASMR virgin

03:32:23.260 --> 03:32:25.260
Um, I never made

03:32:25.820 --> 03:32:29.740
audio content like that before. Um, I

03:32:30.780 --> 03:32:32.780
did like I teased a little bit

03:32:33.260 --> 03:32:35.260
on stream

03:32:35.420 --> 03:32:37.420
for my uh, my past life

03:32:37.900 --> 03:32:42.220
And like tried to read like skirting the edge ns of w on twitch

03:32:43.100 --> 03:32:45.100
and um

03:32:45.980 --> 03:32:49.900
That I was like, but I'm like, you can't corrupt me. I'm already messed up

03:32:50.540 --> 03:32:55.580
And the she forgets that the minimum that she said you could apply with was just drawing stuff

03:32:55.580 --> 03:33:02.460
And I drew a lot of smut of my character and I commissioned a lot of smut art. I'm like, so um

03:33:03.580 --> 03:33:06.060
And in my in my audition, I didn't even do anything

03:33:06.300 --> 03:33:12.860
Uh, lewd. I was just like, hi, I'm redacted and this is my redacted for vealer

03:33:15.260 --> 03:33:18.620
Can you give us a sample of your ASMR? Well, you'll get that tomorrow

03:33:19.180 --> 03:33:21.180
You can wait until tomorrow

03:33:21.260 --> 03:33:23.740
Or you can I don't know go to my alt account or whatever

03:33:25.580 --> 03:33:28.540
I hoping the alert is a male gen. I'm sorry that will never happen

03:33:29.820 --> 03:33:33.660
And strani said it in her exposing vealer. We will not have a male gen

03:33:34.540 --> 03:33:36.860
I'm sorry if you want to honestly

03:33:37.820 --> 03:33:39.420
There is such

03:33:39.420 --> 03:33:46.860
Like I think what will be cool about vealer is that people will be like, oh, yeah, that's right sex house and um

03:33:47.580 --> 03:33:50.460
I won't be surprised if like like, uh

03:33:51.900 --> 03:33:58.060
Not like needy, but like somebody out there with like a lot of money is like, you know what I want to make a male

03:33:58.620 --> 03:34:01.580
um equivalent of vealer, um

03:34:02.540 --> 03:34:09.740
But yeah, because people will be like, I know like people probably like, oh male gen because you want to make the content too, but like

03:34:10.460 --> 03:34:11.980
um

03:34:11.980 --> 03:34:14.540
people some viewers will anticipate like

03:34:16.380 --> 03:34:18.540
Interacting like with um

03:34:19.900 --> 03:34:21.900
talents from other gents and like

03:34:22.700 --> 03:34:29.580
What's unique about vealer is that although we do the content that we do which is ASMR lewd roleplay content

03:34:29.740 --> 03:34:31.740
We are also kind of

03:34:32.140 --> 03:34:35.100
In the vein of japanese idol stuff because we don't

03:34:36.220 --> 03:34:37.980
Talk to guys

03:34:37.980 --> 03:34:39.980
And like they're fine and all um

03:34:41.100 --> 03:34:42.700
But also like

03:34:42.700 --> 03:34:45.020
Like strani said in her exposing me a lure video

03:34:45.580 --> 03:34:47.180
uh

03:34:47.180 --> 03:34:49.180
She's not a dude

03:34:49.420 --> 03:34:51.180
I don't like we can't

03:34:51.180 --> 03:34:53.340
We can't the management company

03:34:54.620 --> 03:34:57.340
Then strani can't they're not dudes like can't

03:34:57.420 --> 03:35:03.740
How are they gonna advise dudes like if they're not dudes, you know, no femme boys

03:35:04.140 --> 03:35:06.620
I'll be the the emmy could be your femme boy

03:35:07.980 --> 03:35:09.740
Gender bent no

03:35:09.740 --> 03:35:14.540
There's death. There's so many lewd tubers out there. So many lewd tubers

03:35:14.940 --> 03:35:18.780
There's male lewd tubers that you can find that make that sort of content

03:35:18.940 --> 03:35:23.100
So you're not gonna die if you don't get femme boys at vealer

03:35:24.060 --> 03:35:28.700
Well, we're on the topic of the old stuff. Do you saw the cursed ass monkey and

03:35:29.820 --> 03:35:31.820
I need everyone that yeah, I do

03:35:33.660 --> 03:35:36.940
Wait, no, it's long this it's not on this though. Wait, can I

03:35:39.340 --> 03:35:41.340
Hold up

03:35:41.740 --> 03:35:44.860
I don't know if it's I don't know if it's on this computer

03:35:46.860 --> 03:35:49.260
I have a very funny picture of Ed Sheeran

03:35:49.500 --> 03:35:53.020
Let's see if I can find it

03:35:59.660 --> 03:36:03.820
This might take me a minute, please. Oh, oh shit. What the fuck?

03:36:14.860 --> 03:36:16.860
Nope, nope, that's not it

03:36:19.340 --> 03:36:21.340
Oh

03:36:22.860 --> 03:36:27.020
Guys, don't worry. It's worth it. It's just gonna take me a moment to find

03:36:31.900 --> 03:36:41.340
Um, but as for like past life stuff, I'm I'm probably not going to talk about it. I know like, um

03:36:45.660 --> 03:36:47.660
I know that

03:36:48.060 --> 03:36:50.860
I know that, um, Amy did but

03:36:53.260 --> 03:36:55.260
That's

03:36:55.260 --> 03:36:58.460
That that's another I'm moving on to a different chapter in my life

03:36:58.540 --> 03:37:04.700
So I'm not really gonna brush on it. If you know, you know, if you don't then sucks because my past life was awesome

03:37:05.500 --> 03:37:07.500
All right

03:37:07.740 --> 03:37:10.620
Yeah, this is a great great image

03:37:14.940 --> 03:37:16.940
What is that creature

03:37:17.820 --> 03:37:19.820
I

03:37:20.060 --> 03:37:22.060
It's Ed Sheeran

03:37:22.540 --> 03:37:24.540
Okay, little monkey

03:37:26.300 --> 03:37:33.500
All right, let me get rid of that. Um, yeah, we whatever you feel like doing is he coming or is he returning?

03:37:35.020 --> 03:37:37.020
Is he returning an iPhone?

03:37:38.860 --> 03:37:43.100
This is me every a psycho eyes. Yeah, you know, I don't like I want to know what picture

03:37:43.740 --> 03:37:49.980
They took that from like obviously like they just like put his face on this person in an apple store wearing a monkey outfit

03:37:50.300 --> 03:37:53.820
But I'm like where's it's like so well deep faked

03:37:56.940 --> 03:37:58.220
Um

03:37:58.220 --> 03:38:05.420
You do you mind diving into my past life? I'm not really any different to how I am now like my void like I was

03:38:06.060 --> 03:38:09.100
I was um cute and funny in my past life

03:38:09.900 --> 03:38:13.580
That's really the only difference, but like I did the same things

03:38:14.220 --> 03:38:16.540
I'm still the same person. I'm just a little bit more

03:38:17.340 --> 03:38:19.340
Dummy

03:38:19.500 --> 03:38:21.500
Um

03:38:22.700 --> 03:38:28.540
But all my content scrub, you don't you might be able to find a clip somewhere, but I doubt it

03:38:29.740 --> 03:38:31.340
um

03:38:31.340 --> 03:38:33.340
Capacity of sheebie dunk of

03:38:33.740 --> 03:38:35.740
basketball, no

03:38:35.980 --> 03:38:37.500
too short

03:38:37.580 --> 03:38:43.020
All I think I know about your past level you're supposed to be a brown cat girl, which is like 50% of youtubers. Yeah, literally

03:38:43.980 --> 03:38:45.980
Cat girl, that's all you need to know

03:38:47.500 --> 03:38:52.540
Can you do some green screens? It's mostly being oh, yeah, yeah, that'd be that'd be actually pretty smart to do

03:38:53.020 --> 03:38:55.660
Um, I was thinking about that the other day because I was going through

03:38:56.380 --> 03:38:58.460
Like the pictures I post I just take them on my phone

03:38:59.740 --> 03:39:02.620
Um and vtube studio on my phone because I've exported my model

03:39:03.260 --> 03:39:07.180
And I'm like, oh, I should use the green screen so people can like use them and put them in be like

03:39:07.740 --> 03:39:09.740
Put them in silly memes

03:39:11.820 --> 03:39:14.140
Same just a dump. Yeah, essentially and then I just make

03:39:15.340 --> 03:39:16.940
naughty content

03:39:16.940 --> 03:39:18.940
Check out my patreon

03:39:18.940 --> 03:39:23.820
Um, can we get black hair sheebie probably do you get past life flashbacks?

03:39:25.100 --> 03:39:32.860
Not really like I was a very small creator like I wasn't like emmy or anything. I was very unknown

03:39:33.820 --> 03:39:36.540
Um, so that's why I'm even more thankful that I'm here

03:39:36.860 --> 03:39:38.860
Like I'm very thankful that

03:39:38.940 --> 03:39:42.860
scrawny picked me and nobody to be part of this

03:39:43.740 --> 03:39:51.100
Because she saw something in me. She said she saw a 2.0 version of herself and that made me cry when she told me that in the interview

03:39:51.580 --> 03:39:53.580
um

03:39:54.220 --> 03:39:56.220
But uh, but yeah

03:39:58.060 --> 03:40:00.060
Yeah, but

03:40:00.300 --> 03:40:03.820
You don't okay, just because you don't have to talk about it

03:40:04.620 --> 03:40:07.340
So that's that's the end of it. That's the end of the past life talk

03:40:08.460 --> 03:40:10.460
She's she's gone

03:40:11.100 --> 03:40:13.100
She's she's been let go

03:40:14.540 --> 03:40:16.540
Because I'm determined to

03:40:17.420 --> 03:40:19.420
move forward with she be and make vealer

03:40:20.460 --> 03:40:21.900
a um

03:40:21.900 --> 03:40:24.860
An amazing place. I want like people are like, ah

03:40:25.980 --> 03:40:27.980
vealer is gonna explode in a year

03:40:28.540 --> 03:40:35.980
Like how are these girls are going to be gone? You do not know how determined we are to make this like when you have a

03:40:36.780 --> 03:40:38.780
person like

03:40:39.420 --> 03:40:41.420
scrawny um

03:40:41.500 --> 03:40:46.620
Heading things like you and like some of the reeflings know like you want to ride or die like

03:40:47.900 --> 03:40:50.860
Uh, we're all so motivated to make vealer

03:40:51.820 --> 03:40:53.820
amazing, um

03:40:54.620 --> 03:40:55.820
Um

03:40:55.820 --> 03:41:02.780
And we're like, oh, they're gonna have woman moments. Oh, they're gonna. Yeah. Oh like but we all got good heads on our shoulders

03:41:03.740 --> 03:41:09.580
Um, I'm really proud of the other girls how like mature and talented they are

03:41:11.020 --> 03:41:13.020
vealer is not here

03:41:14.220 --> 03:41:17.340
For a short time. We are here for a long time and a good time

03:41:19.500 --> 03:41:21.500
And uh, yeah

03:41:21.820 --> 03:41:23.820
You can freaking clip this

03:41:24.540 --> 03:41:27.900
And really you could you'd be like, oh, let me clip this so that

03:41:28.780 --> 03:41:30.940
We see if his age is terribly it won't

03:41:31.980 --> 03:41:33.980
It won't we have so much stuff planned

03:41:35.260 --> 03:41:38.780
Can't wait. I'm so excited. I'm so happy to be here. You guys have no idea

03:41:41.180 --> 03:41:44.380
Um yapping is literally what we want. Yeah, I'm here to get

03:41:45.340 --> 03:41:49.100
All the ladies seem absolutely fantastically. This would be not an exception. Thank you. I appreciate that

03:41:50.060 --> 03:41:52.060
Um and even like

03:41:52.460 --> 03:41:57.340
Like again, like I said, I was small. I was a small vtuber people

03:41:57.580 --> 03:42:00.540
I had like maybe like max 20 people watching me

03:42:01.100 --> 03:42:06.780
I already feel like I've succeeded. It was my goal to be in a in a corpo. It was my goal to join an agency

03:42:07.660 --> 03:42:09.420
and I didn't

03:42:09.420 --> 03:42:12.860
I didn't expect to have 11k views on my baby like that

03:42:13.260 --> 03:42:19.900
Boggled my mind like I never thought people would actually want to watch me and that people thought I'd be entertaining, you know

03:42:21.020 --> 03:42:26.460
But I'm I'm just happy. I make you happy and I'm happy that you find me entertaining and the other girls are entertaining

03:42:27.100 --> 03:42:31.660
Like I like watching the girls like again, like I said, I don't usually watch a lot of vtubers

03:42:31.740 --> 03:42:36.620
But I will sit and watch strawny for hours. I was watching her a little bit. I was watching icy

03:42:37.500 --> 03:42:39.980
Is there like they're all such wonderful entertainers to

03:42:40.700 --> 03:42:42.700
She really picked good ones

03:42:43.100 --> 03:42:44.220
Um

03:42:44.220 --> 03:42:49.180
So I didn't read his character till I should be yeah, I remember. Yeah, uh, somebody like asked if I um

03:42:51.180 --> 03:42:53.740
I'll I'll give you some all exposed to be alert some more

03:42:55.100 --> 03:42:57.100
I'll tell you who we all went for

03:42:57.420 --> 03:42:59.020
um

03:42:59.020 --> 03:43:04.940
In terms of models and how it ended up being so much better that we didn't get who we wanted

03:43:07.260 --> 03:43:09.180
Um

03:43:09.180 --> 03:43:10.620
so

03:43:10.700 --> 03:43:15.020
Again, like as I mentioned, I was I was cute and funny in my past life. So I went for

03:43:16.300 --> 03:43:19.740
Pins I went for well, I didn't go for like anybody in particular

03:43:19.820 --> 03:43:25.180
But I was hoping for like I said, please give me anybody but I was hoping for pins aka emi

03:43:26.460 --> 03:43:27.900
um

03:43:27.900 --> 03:43:29.900
And it's funny because emi

03:43:29.900 --> 03:43:36.700
I think was going for mercy and mercy was going for icy and icy was going for emi and azura was just azura

03:43:36.700 --> 03:43:40.300
Because she's just perfect for azura and then strani strani, but it was just funny

03:43:40.700 --> 03:43:43.180
And then we're all here and we're all looking at each other and we're all like

03:43:43.980 --> 03:43:46.540
I wouldn't want it any other way. Like I feel

03:43:47.420 --> 03:43:51.580
Really good being she be and everybody else is so good

03:43:52.700 --> 03:43:54.300
being

03:43:54.300 --> 03:43:56.300
their respective

03:43:56.540 --> 03:44:00.540
People and we're still like learning about ourselves and like getting into the characters and like

03:44:01.100 --> 03:44:05.260
Getting the kayfabe and like we're still like so thank you for your patience with us

03:44:05.340 --> 03:44:09.500
And yeah, like I think it worked out in the end. I hundred percent worked out in the end. Um

03:44:10.860 --> 03:44:13.100
You cute and funny what you don't

03:44:14.140 --> 03:44:19.420
You don't think I can be going funny. I don't be really going funny. I don't know what you're talking about

03:44:24.380 --> 03:44:26.380
My mom

03:44:26.620 --> 03:44:32.060
Yeah, it's gonna take something like I can't wait. We're gonna learn we're gonna grow and we'll make mistakes

03:44:32.460 --> 03:44:34.460
And we'll learn from those mistakes

03:44:35.340 --> 03:44:38.380
And we'll take the feedback. We'll take the critique

03:44:39.100 --> 03:44:41.820
We'll take the trolling with a grain of salt, but like

03:44:43.340 --> 03:44:48.300
I just I can't wait to see where we'll be a year from now because in a year gen two

03:44:49.580 --> 03:44:51.180
gen two

03:44:51.180 --> 03:44:53.180
Maybe after that gen three

03:44:54.060 --> 03:44:56.060
I just want to help strani build like just

03:44:57.100 --> 03:44:58.380
realize

03:44:58.380 --> 03:45:00.380
her dream and then

03:45:01.340 --> 03:45:04.540
This is a dream of mine to be part of something bigger

03:45:05.420 --> 03:45:07.420
You know

03:45:07.980 --> 03:45:10.620
I think I always stop pretending. It was a crab game shooting in the goth

03:45:13.900 --> 03:45:19.020
And then one year two fast no actually like what I've noticed recently is a lot of

03:45:19.580 --> 03:45:25.980
Companies have been putting out generations like six months after and I'm like I thought that was too fast

03:45:26.460 --> 03:45:28.220
um

03:45:28.220 --> 03:45:34.060
And I think a year for v2 like the first generation to get it established is pretty good

03:45:34.860 --> 03:45:36.860
um

03:45:37.180 --> 03:45:40.620
So no, she's an investor detail is an investor

03:45:41.900 --> 03:45:43.100
She's an investor

03:45:43.100 --> 03:45:47.580
Sean is our creative director. We have management. We got editors like we have this whole team behind us

03:45:49.420 --> 03:45:52.380
Um, I feel like six months. It's hard to get established

03:45:53.340 --> 03:45:55.340
as a

03:45:55.340 --> 03:45:57.340
especially like a first gen um

03:45:58.060 --> 03:46:00.060
So I'm happy we have a year

03:46:00.220 --> 03:46:02.220
And like another thing

03:46:02.300 --> 03:46:06.700
But then you can argue like okay, if you've been streaming longer before that in your past life

03:46:06.700 --> 03:46:09.980
Which most have been like because let's be honest a lot of the

03:46:10.940 --> 03:46:12.460
people in

03:46:12.460 --> 03:46:17.100
corpos and agencies right now are already formal corpo and agency girls like

03:46:17.900 --> 03:46:20.780
Ex Sundaria members x this x that

03:46:21.340 --> 03:46:27.900
Um, so they already have that stuff under their belt. So it kind of makes sense when they go into another company and they're like

03:46:28.860 --> 03:46:33.340
Okay, you're good. And then they send another like sick because there hasn't been like I think

03:46:34.620 --> 03:46:37.420
Villalur and even like you may plus have been

03:46:38.220 --> 03:46:39.580
uh

03:46:39.580 --> 03:46:41.580
in recent

03:46:41.580 --> 03:46:48.380
Years like the only companies to hire brand new girls if that makes sense because like

03:46:49.580 --> 03:46:55.500
None of us like none of the girls in Villalur are former corpo like we've all been indies before that

03:46:55.740 --> 03:46:58.380
So then we all really worked really hard to be

03:46:59.260 --> 03:47:01.260
in Villalur, so

03:47:02.380 --> 03:47:04.380
Yeah, Jenny it doesn't seem so

03:47:05.180 --> 03:47:07.180
Yeah, um

03:47:07.500 --> 03:47:09.500
it you know

03:47:09.740 --> 03:47:12.700
It really depends I think it really depends on the company

03:47:13.100 --> 03:47:19.020
I know some people like beg for second gents because to be honest they probably get bored of um

03:47:20.620 --> 03:47:24.860
The other gen or they're just like okay. This gen isn't my cup of tea

03:47:25.660 --> 03:47:30.540
Can I please get another one? And so I think that's another reason why companies put out

03:47:31.260 --> 03:47:35.500
Agencies so fast because they just want to appeal to the masses which is not what you should

03:47:35.820 --> 03:47:40.940
Which is well, of course is like you should appeal to them, but you can't just accelerate in your company

03:47:42.940 --> 03:47:47.100
Just try to find try to hit like one person correctly

03:47:47.820 --> 03:47:49.820
that everybody likes

03:47:50.140 --> 03:47:53.420
You know ball gen one. I know I want to get a bald toggle. It's like

03:47:54.140 --> 03:47:56.140
And this is my ears

03:47:57.420 --> 03:48:00.140
Very embryo glad hearing voices. Yeah, I like was

03:48:01.180 --> 03:48:08.460
Really worried I wasn't gonna get into Villalur because I wasn't a former agency girl and like I'll say this

03:48:09.900 --> 03:48:15.580
So like I mentioned in my 2.0. I applied for like 10 different auditions several different companies

03:48:16.220 --> 03:48:18.060
um

03:48:18.060 --> 03:48:23.020
And honestly it was kind of stupid of me to apply those companies because at that point I didn't have any

03:48:23.980 --> 03:48:27.660
V2 being experience only normal streaming experience. So I um

03:48:28.300 --> 03:48:31.340
This is kind of they're like why is this flesh person applying?

03:48:33.100 --> 03:48:37.740
Um, and then I applied as appeal to a couple of them and it's funny because then I like I look at like

03:48:38.620 --> 03:48:40.620
like I applied to vnu

03:48:41.260 --> 03:48:43.340
And I look and I'm like

03:48:43.340 --> 03:48:47.740
You know, I'm kind of happy I didn't get in because they fit their characters so well, you know

03:48:48.780 --> 03:48:52.780
And um same for like idle and stuff. I applied to idle. Um

03:48:53.500 --> 03:48:55.500
and I was like

03:48:55.500 --> 03:49:00.700
I don't see myself like they're everybody like fits their people so well, you know

03:49:01.580 --> 03:49:06.300
It's hard to see them as anybody else or see myself as one like oh, I could have been a better version

03:49:06.380 --> 03:49:08.460
like I don't I don't ever really say that because

03:49:09.740 --> 03:49:11.420
yeah

03:49:11.420 --> 03:49:16.460
Most industries are passing around the same people especially entertainment though. Yeah, there's always a thing of like nepotism

03:49:16.940 --> 03:49:18.620
um

03:49:18.620 --> 03:49:20.140
I know

03:49:20.140 --> 03:49:22.140
Yeah, like a lot of companies

03:49:22.940 --> 03:49:27.900
Usually like we'll have their talents vouch for other like indies or a talents from like

03:49:28.620 --> 03:49:34.620
Former talents from companies and stuff. So it's like, yeah, it's pretty common in the um in the entertainment industry

03:49:37.020 --> 03:49:39.740
Clapping with no handlebars one, excuse me

03:49:42.140 --> 03:49:44.140
She be as Kai

03:49:44.780 --> 03:49:46.780
um

03:49:46.860 --> 03:49:51.660
This is a very long invitation to show business. Yeah, like what I like what really attracted me

03:49:52.300 --> 03:49:53.340
to

03:49:53.340 --> 03:49:57.420
Vila and honestly just like straw knees ideas in general was that she isn't

03:49:58.540 --> 03:49:59.500
Uh

03:49:59.500 --> 03:50:03.100
She's kind of breaking the mold to my voice is cracking

03:50:03.820 --> 03:50:08.060
Of some btuber standards like for example, she doesn't care if we talk about our past lives

03:50:08.460 --> 03:50:14.460
So that's why and we talked about hers and you probably already know the other girls past lives and I know some of you know mine, but um

03:50:15.420 --> 03:50:19.180
Uh because it's like taboo normally to do that. Um

03:50:20.380 --> 03:50:25.980
Or just like having a collab ban for the first week like I could collab with an indy tomorrow

03:50:27.020 --> 03:50:35.340
But I'm settling in a she be first. So that's why I haven't done that indy or another kropa girl tomorrow. Um, also like in terms of

03:50:36.700 --> 03:50:40.780
The transparency with how much they pay us like all that stuff

03:50:41.340 --> 03:50:45.660
Do you know I know your past lives? Yes. I do know who you were

03:50:46.540 --> 03:50:50.700
I'll do I'll do like a past life regression stream where I just

03:50:52.620 --> 03:50:55.420
Pretend to spiritually know who you were in a past life

03:50:57.580 --> 03:50:59.820
How can you get a job experience though getting hard? Yeah

03:51:00.540 --> 03:51:03.660
That's not yeah, it's like that thing where companies are like

03:51:03.820 --> 03:51:07.260
Oh, you must have eight years of this and the company's only been open

03:51:07.660 --> 03:51:10.220
Like or the industry's only been around for like two years

03:51:11.980 --> 03:51:15.340
So like it kind of does make sense that there is a lot of nepotism in the industry

03:51:16.460 --> 03:51:18.460
You know because they're like, oh this person

03:51:19.020 --> 03:51:23.740
Wants to join a corporation their former agency kind of you know, shit the bed

03:51:24.300 --> 03:51:28.220
Let's give them another chance. We've seen their content. They know how to do this this and that

03:51:28.380 --> 03:51:31.980
So like it makes it it is like business wise

03:51:32.460 --> 03:51:34.300
It makes a lot more sense

03:51:34.300 --> 03:51:37.020
To do that instead of like a bunch of nobodies like

03:51:38.620 --> 03:51:40.380
Like me

03:51:40.380 --> 03:51:42.380
I could have been completely crazy

03:51:42.460 --> 03:51:44.460
I still am crazy

03:51:45.500 --> 03:51:49.260
Was I a frog? Uh, no, you were a salamander. Sorry

03:51:51.500 --> 03:51:53.500
Entry lover job five years experience

03:51:53.900 --> 03:51:57.500
Ask catch them as who employers want a 10 year old 25 years experience letter

03:51:58.940 --> 03:52:00.940
This girl isn't skit so hard

03:52:01.660 --> 03:52:04.620
Um another insider information

03:52:07.740 --> 03:52:10.300
Everybody in the vtuber community is mentally ill

03:52:12.220 --> 03:52:14.220
Everybody's got a touch of tism or something

03:52:15.820 --> 03:52:20.860
So when you're like, oh sick girl corpo. Yeah a lot of people you may in this day and age

03:52:22.300 --> 03:52:24.300
Everybody has something

03:52:24.380 --> 03:52:27.340
Everybody's got something. I'm telling you that right now

03:52:28.060 --> 03:52:36.140
Like I'm uh, I got fibro. I got dysthymia OCD. Um, what else do I get?

03:52:38.300 --> 03:52:41.500
If I haven't been diagnosed with ADHD, but I probably have it

03:52:42.620 --> 03:52:43.740
um

03:52:43.740 --> 03:52:45.740
generalized anxiety like

03:52:45.740 --> 03:52:47.740
Everybody's got something

03:52:47.980 --> 03:52:50.300
Especially with like how we communicate nowadays

03:52:50.940 --> 03:52:52.940
It's like social media

03:52:52.940 --> 03:52:54.940
Hello, I'm an anime girl right now

03:52:55.660 --> 03:52:57.660
Um

03:52:57.820 --> 03:52:59.420
and

03:52:59.420 --> 03:53:01.420
I wish someone would touch my tism

03:53:02.460 --> 03:53:03.660
um

03:53:03.660 --> 03:53:05.660
and like honestly

03:53:06.220 --> 03:53:10.540
A lot of like we know a lot more about mental health now anyways like

03:53:11.100 --> 03:53:17.740
Like my dad, for example, like he a hundred percent probably is adult ADHD because I am my carbon copy of my dad

03:53:18.460 --> 03:53:20.460
I'm just woman form

03:53:21.500 --> 03:53:24.380
We are exactly like I have something called adjustment disorder

03:53:24.940 --> 03:53:26.940
As well and he definitely probably has it

03:53:27.500 --> 03:53:30.700
And I'm like if I get tested for ADHD and I have it

03:53:30.700 --> 03:53:34.620
And I know my dad has it because I didn't really know about that stuff back then, you know

03:53:35.340 --> 03:53:35.900
um

03:53:35.900 --> 03:53:39.340
I used to work in human services and all the people I used to support were

03:53:40.460 --> 03:53:46.220
Institutionalized for the longest time because he didn't understand these poor amazing people and how they just work differently

03:53:47.900 --> 03:53:49.420
Will they form

03:53:49.420 --> 03:53:51.500
Every day I see something that makes me want to get tested for autism

03:53:51.740 --> 03:53:57.180
Yeah, and then on the other hand, there's a lot of people that like self-diagnose when they are like kind of put on

03:53:57.820 --> 03:53:59.820
stuff so that they can feel

03:54:00.700 --> 03:54:03.660
quirky with the label, but you know, that's another conversation

03:54:04.380 --> 03:54:06.140
um

03:54:06.140 --> 03:54:08.140
Daddy Davey when

03:54:09.340 --> 03:54:12.780
I don't know probably I'll probably I think like strawnee said she'll

03:54:13.740 --> 03:54:18.060
She'll have her dad or in record a video with him about like guessing vtuber names

03:54:18.540 --> 03:54:22.220
And I might I might yoink that idea and do that as well after her

03:54:23.180 --> 03:54:30.540
I took a google quiz and it said so and I took that like I don't know what's called. Is it like rad's test to test you for autism?

03:54:31.420 --> 03:54:33.180
because my chat

03:54:33.180 --> 03:54:37.500
In my past life was convinced. I had autism. I don't have autism

03:54:38.220 --> 03:54:43.260
Um, I just really like slime. Okay? Um, and I get distracted easily

03:54:44.620 --> 03:54:46.380
um

03:54:46.460 --> 03:54:52.860
And I did that test and I scored like 104 which is like high and they're like medium indications of autism

03:54:52.860 --> 03:54:54.860
I was like I literally was like

03:54:56.060 --> 03:54:59.500
I was like non-verbal for like two minutes because I'm like wait do I have autism

03:55:00.380 --> 03:55:03.900
Then I'm like no no no it's like these silly things on the internet the like you're like

03:55:07.260 --> 03:55:11.420
Everyone loves slime slime is awesome. I have I have like a bunch of slime. Where did my slime go?

03:55:12.620 --> 03:55:14.620
It's on my it's on my bookshelf

03:55:15.580 --> 03:55:21.500
Um, definitely like slime stream slime ASMR stream. Um, I'm just chat is so cool

03:55:23.020 --> 03:55:27.820
Uh, yeah, I I do have a zoomer energy. I do have a zoomer interests. I um

03:55:28.620 --> 03:55:30.620
despite being a high

03:55:31.580 --> 03:55:36.140
We stay sliming we sliming up in here. That's why I'm begging for a slime girl for gen 2

03:55:37.180 --> 03:55:40.380
because strani's already conceptualizing stuff and

03:55:41.340 --> 03:55:45.020
I've seen some of the concepts and you guys are not ready

03:55:47.020 --> 03:55:51.020
And I'm just like but um, can we please go slime girl?

03:55:54.780 --> 03:55:59.500
No, what hell you don't need today. No, I don't know, you know, I could just be quirky. I could just be weird

03:56:00.380 --> 03:56:02.380
I could just be odd

03:56:03.100 --> 03:56:05.100
Sometimes you're just

03:56:05.260 --> 03:56:07.260
you're just

03:56:08.220 --> 03:56:10.220
A little bit different than

03:56:11.260 --> 03:56:15.500
Society's expectations and but that doesn't also mean you have something, you know

03:56:16.700 --> 03:56:18.700
hag love

03:56:19.340 --> 03:56:21.340
um

03:56:21.500 --> 03:56:24.860
I also want like a vor chuba. I mean what?

03:56:26.700 --> 03:56:28.700
There's a lot of like, uh

03:56:29.180 --> 03:56:31.180
Tags and kinks. I think that would be funny

03:56:31.980 --> 03:56:33.980
for that sort of stuff

03:56:34.380 --> 03:56:36.380
We love older women hag love

03:56:36.780 --> 03:56:38.780
hag love

03:56:38.780 --> 03:56:40.780
hag love

03:56:41.660 --> 03:56:47.260
Some people are just not like the other girls. I know, right? Maybe she's born with it. Maybe it's Maybelline. Eat me mommy

03:56:54.780 --> 03:56:56.780
My face went funny there

03:56:57.820 --> 03:57:00.380
She was on that deviant art, you know, I was on that deviant art, bro

03:57:01.340 --> 03:57:07.100
Although I was on deviant art because I was making really cool photo manipulations of dogs and wolves because

03:57:07.980 --> 03:57:09.740
that was weird

03:57:09.740 --> 03:57:11.740
and I was an avid wolf role player for

03:57:13.420 --> 03:57:15.420
10 years

03:57:17.420 --> 03:57:19.580
I'm saying make myself sound older than I am

03:57:21.260 --> 03:57:23.260
No, it wasn't 10 years. It's more like

03:57:25.100 --> 03:57:27.740
We love a drop of yado vtuber and my life is yours

03:57:28.700 --> 03:57:35.420
Wolf of rabbit's clothing. Yeah furry affectionate. Uh, I probably was a furry, but I don't think I want

03:57:35.420 --> 03:57:40.860
I just really liked post-by-post role play like I'd be on like role players guild and stuff because I like to write a lot

03:57:41.420 --> 03:57:44.860
I love my creative writing class in school. And so I just um

03:57:46.460 --> 03:57:47.580
I

03:57:47.580 --> 03:57:51.100
I was on this website called like wet paint, which is like

03:57:51.980 --> 03:57:55.420
Site hosting place and a lot of people did like role play like whether it be like warrior cats

03:57:55.820 --> 03:57:59.340
Or like human role plays gifted role plays. Um, all that stuff

03:58:00.620 --> 03:58:03.660
And I was in a lot of like wolf, uh role plays

03:58:04.380 --> 03:58:06.220
and dude

03:58:06.220 --> 03:58:11.020
I thought those were my golden years. I was no life and I think pewter for like eight hours or day

03:58:11.100 --> 03:58:16.780
Just being a wolf, but it was just cool because I know I was I like I'm not only child. Um, so I had

03:58:17.580 --> 03:58:20.060
No one to talk to you. I still just hung out on the internet all the time

03:58:21.260 --> 03:58:23.420
and just did uh role play stuff

03:58:24.380 --> 03:58:26.380
Howling at the moon. Oh

03:58:27.340 --> 03:58:29.820
On all levels except physical. I am a wolf

03:58:33.100 --> 03:58:38.700
Um, but I remember one of my favorite things about wolf role playing was, um

03:58:40.220 --> 03:58:42.220
Oh dude

03:58:42.700 --> 03:58:44.700
First of all wolf quest

03:58:44.780 --> 03:58:49.260
Wolf quest learning that side note learning that doki bird played wolf quest

03:58:49.740 --> 03:58:55.740
Made my life because I thought I was like the only one that played wolf quest. It was funny on my pl

03:58:55.820 --> 03:58:57.820
I had played wolf quest like, um

03:58:57.820 --> 03:59:00.140
Like a couple months before she did and I was just like

03:59:01.820 --> 03:59:06.220
Because I used to do role playing on wolf quest. That was a gay. Oh, well, we're gonna play wolf quest

03:59:06.780 --> 03:59:09.260
I have wolf quest we're playing it. Um

03:59:10.060 --> 03:59:13.660
And now you tell other people to bark for you exactly. I still told people to bark for me back then

03:59:14.220 --> 03:59:20.700
Wolf quest the real origin one went. I know right. Um, but uh

03:59:22.540 --> 03:59:24.540
I know it was a g

03:59:28.220 --> 03:59:29.900
But um

03:59:29.900 --> 03:59:33.100
I used to do this it was called it's gonna make it sound like I did a drug

03:59:33.340 --> 03:59:37.980
But we there was a type of role playing called speed

03:59:38.940 --> 03:59:43.660
So speed role playing was one sentence post by post role playing

03:59:43.980 --> 03:59:46.460
But you had you would get hits

03:59:47.340 --> 03:59:53.180
On the other character because it was it was like fighting you get hits on the other character by how fast you type

03:59:53.180 --> 03:59:55.180
So if I managed to um

03:59:55.740 --> 04:00:00.540
Type faster than you did a sentence of me doing an act and you took damage then I then I beat you

04:00:01.020 --> 04:00:06.140
Um, and then there's like a certain amount of hits you would do and different like you had a cross distance

04:00:06.860 --> 04:00:11.020
um, and you had to I show speed and you had to um

04:00:11.900 --> 04:00:16.540
Uh, like get certain holds like I remember it was like eight

04:00:17.980 --> 04:00:19.980
Hits to break a spine

04:00:20.300 --> 04:00:22.300
or like six hits to

04:00:23.340 --> 04:00:26.060
Get the throw and you could like throw people off. It was really fun

04:00:27.180 --> 04:00:30.140
Um, so I had like a hundred plus word per minute

04:00:31.340 --> 04:00:33.340
Yeah, it was really it was actually

04:00:33.900 --> 04:00:36.540
In Minecraft. Yes, of course in Minecraft. It was really fun

04:00:36.620 --> 04:00:40.940
I think that was like I I prided myself on being such a fast fucking typer

04:00:41.820 --> 04:00:43.340
um

04:00:43.340 --> 04:00:48.620
I can't do it now though. I think my words per minute is probably only like 60 or less than that

04:00:49.660 --> 04:00:51.660
Punchy. Yeah, I was running around punching people in the spine

04:00:54.060 --> 04:00:57.500
Um, I think what I liked about role playing as well

04:00:57.580 --> 04:01:04.140
It was like I could take out aggression because we would raid other packs and go on their website and raid their chats

04:01:04.220 --> 04:01:06.220
and just start fucking marking people

04:01:06.700 --> 04:01:08.220
out I

04:01:08.220 --> 04:01:11.500
I killed children. I killed pregnant children pregnant children

04:01:12.140 --> 04:01:17.500
I killed pregnant wolves and I killed children. I took lives blood in my ma

04:01:18.780 --> 04:01:20.540
um

04:01:20.540 --> 04:01:24.220
But uh, what do you think of your chat? Um, I get

04:01:25.180 --> 04:01:28.940
I I'm also like mercy and I get can get motion sick. So I can't do VR

04:01:29.020 --> 04:01:33.500
So VR chat like I've done it without VR headset, but it still makes me a little bit dizzy

04:01:34.540 --> 04:01:36.540
Not the young links

04:01:36.940 --> 04:01:41.980
Um, but yeah, I was I remember the crafting really cool stories. I think I have like

04:01:43.500 --> 04:01:50.620
I think oh, maybe I could like log into my super fucking old email and try it because I remember I saved some posts

04:01:51.340 --> 04:01:56.620
Of um some role plays that I did with my friend. Um, because we had like our ocs in your role play with each other

04:01:57.420 --> 04:01:58.940
and then

04:01:58.940 --> 04:02:02.860
We had like a almost like a john carter esque like princess of mars

04:02:03.420 --> 04:02:06.220
role play. It was really funny. Um, and then

04:02:07.260 --> 04:02:10.380
Like I think I had one of like a really dramatic

04:02:11.900 --> 04:02:14.060
Posts of like my wolf character dying

04:02:15.820 --> 04:02:19.980
Um, but I yeah, no, I I I really miss that because I love creative writing

04:02:19.980 --> 04:02:27.820
I would I remember my dad um said that and my mom were like, oh, she's gonna grow up to be an author and that did not happen

04:02:29.180 --> 04:02:30.460
but um

04:02:30.460 --> 04:02:34.540
Yeah, writing's fun reading's fun for me. I haven't done any of that stuff in a bit though. I've been

04:02:35.500 --> 04:02:39.900
It just sucks when you get like older and like real stuff gets in the way, you know

04:02:40.700 --> 04:02:43.900
Like life adulting. I'm like, oh, I have to have a job

04:02:44.620 --> 04:02:46.620
Oh, I have to pay bills

04:02:46.700 --> 04:02:50.700
Oh, I have to take care of my health and well-being

04:02:51.740 --> 04:02:58.060
I can't just rot away. I'm like what I'd give to be like 10 again. Just do fuck all, you know

04:03:01.260 --> 04:03:04.060
If you dig john carter read jane carver of war interesting

04:03:05.100 --> 04:03:10.460
Does she we have a bunny? Yeah, I have a bunny tail. You can't see it on my model

04:03:11.500 --> 04:03:13.500
But I do have a bunny tail

04:03:13.820 --> 04:03:15.820
Oh

04:03:16.140 --> 04:03:21.500
Yeah, adulting does suck. I hate adulting like I was um, I was talking about my alt this morning

04:03:21.500 --> 04:03:24.220
I had to like go to the bank because I lost my bank card

04:03:24.620 --> 04:03:29.260
I'm like, I need I'm late on my rent and the banks were closed over the weekend

04:03:29.660 --> 04:03:32.940
And I couldn't pay my rent and then it still wouldn't work

04:03:33.020 --> 04:03:37.180
So then I had to write a check and then I had to remember how to write a check and I'm like, uh

04:03:38.780 --> 04:03:40.780
Being an adult

04:03:41.100 --> 04:03:44.380
Shibi when you were a fnaf kid. Oh, I love fnaf, but um

04:03:45.340 --> 04:03:49.020

04:05:29.020 --> 04:05:29.980

I like being honest with you guys, but um

04:05:33.500 --> 04:05:39.260
When you're always down, you kind of don't see a future so you don't work on your future. So like I didn't

04:05:40.780 --> 04:05:42.380
Really focus on

04:05:42.380 --> 04:05:47.580
Like going to college a lot and focus on this and I focused on that. I didn't like pick up certain skills

04:05:48.300 --> 04:05:50.300
um

04:05:51.020 --> 04:05:52.220
But

04:05:52.220 --> 04:05:57.980
In hindsight and like and obviously like hindsight's always 2020 like I wish I wish I could like give my little younger self a hug

04:05:57.980 --> 04:06:02.780
And be like you're fine. I know you have severe social anxiety and you can't talk to people

04:06:03.340 --> 04:06:07.900
Um, but you're gonna be okay and now you're talking to hundreds of people on the internet

04:06:08.700 --> 04:06:11.740
And they like to watch you and talk about stuff. Um

04:06:39.980 --> 04:06:41.980
You just have to find something that you want to

04:06:42.620 --> 04:06:44.620
Work and live for for me. It's my cats

04:06:45.500 --> 04:06:46.620

04:07:55.180 --> 04:07:57.180
dominating you emotionally. Yeah

dearest heart because she tried so hard

04:08:17.900 --> 04:08:22.380
To like have me find an interest that wasn't being on the computer and doing games

04:08:22.860 --> 04:08:24.860
So like I did horseback riding

04:08:25.660 --> 04:08:30.940
I did ice skating. I did gymnastics. I did ballet. Um, I did a lot of

04:08:31.740 --> 04:08:33.740

Uh, yeah, I did a lot of different like act active hobbies

04:08:41.020 --> 04:08:42.540

And doing an activity to keep me engaged being an only child and everything then like

To my parents, you know

They were like, why are you a whore and you have such a good relationship to your parents? I don't know

It's always the christian girls, is it?

04:09:52.860 --> 04:09:54.860
When you're hyper repressed

04:09:55.580 --> 04:09:57.580
This is what happens

04:10:00.140 --> 04:10:01.580

04:11:04.380 --> 04:11:06.780
Maybe I should get another male cat. So he has someone to like

04:11:07.340 --> 04:11:10.220
wrestle with because rain is like 14 years old she

04:11:10.860 --> 04:11:13.820
But she she's the she runs this shit. I'll tell you that much

04:11:14.780 --> 04:11:16.540
Fia's the baby

04:11:16.540 --> 04:11:20.460
Boomi just turned a year old and fia just turned a year old. Um, but fia's

04:11:21.100 --> 04:11:26.620
Much smaller. I think because of the issue she had with her like not being able to move and walk her

04:11:27.580 --> 04:11:31.020
Her like muscles astrophied and she was she's really really small

04:11:31.100 --> 04:11:35.420
Like she's literally the same size when she was a kitten. So Boomi just fucking beats the shit out of her

04:11:35.500 --> 04:11:38.460
So I have to there's like a clip out there somewhere of like Boomi like

04:11:39.820 --> 04:11:46.780
slamming her on the ground. Um, well, I had a cat cam on it was so sad. It was like

04:11:49.820 --> 04:11:54.300
Far cats is like, oh, I'm getting myself bigger when I'm trying to scroll up. Uh, whatever

04:11:55.260 --> 04:11:57.740
You be issues don't include Bonnie issues

04:12:00.300 --> 04:12:04.940
No, I got you, you know, I got I got my mommy and daddy issues. I'm not telling you any of that stuff though

04:12:07.500 --> 04:12:09.500
Religious trauma

04:12:10.540 --> 04:12:15.340
Cat Jen when I hope we get a cat girl for next time. That'd be cool. Like a pet play girl

04:12:15.820 --> 04:12:18.380
Ooh, a pet play girl would be so good

04:12:19.420 --> 04:12:21.420
Because I'll be honest with you

04:12:21.980 --> 04:12:23.980
I didn't when I first saw

04:12:24.540 --> 04:12:25.500
um

04:12:25.500 --> 04:12:28.460
My model I had the same idea as you I didn't know

04:12:29.100 --> 04:12:33.900
If I was gonna be a dummy mommy because I'm like, oh, she's wearing shabari. Maybe she's like a rope bunny

04:12:34.620 --> 04:12:36.620
Submissive so like I totally get it

04:12:36.700 --> 04:12:41.980
I'm like, oh like well, I have a pet play angle and then she'd be like she'd be strong. He's like no

04:12:42.780 --> 04:12:44.780
But I'm like, oh, okay

04:12:44.940 --> 04:12:47.580
She's like you're dumb. I'm like got you on it. Fuck you

04:12:48.540 --> 04:12:50.540
Why do I see a waifu

04:12:51.340 --> 04:12:56.140
And beginning of she I don't know what that means you see official cat throw down

04:12:58.140 --> 04:13:04.700
Yeah, our dog a dog. Oh like a dog pet play girl. It'd be sick. She'd be your top down. Okay. I can work with that

04:13:07.500 --> 04:13:14.540
But um, yeah, I think one of the biggest things that sticks to me, um with uh my interview

04:13:15.500 --> 04:13:20.940
With strongy is she was like you were always going to be my sheepsters and I was like

04:13:22.940 --> 04:13:25.900
Crop wait cries profusely

04:13:28.220 --> 04:13:30.220
Um wolf girl for wolf quest

04:13:32.940 --> 04:13:38.540
Uh, I don't someone also asked my mirror I was like boomie leave her alone

04:13:39.100 --> 04:13:41.100
Oh

04:13:41.420 --> 04:13:43.420
Stop

04:13:43.420 --> 04:13:44.700
You hear that?

04:13:44.700 --> 04:13:46.140
That's boomie

04:13:46.140 --> 04:13:48.060
He doesn't meow. He just

04:13:48.060 --> 04:13:51.820
Coo's weird chicken girl that actually be pretty funny. Um

04:13:54.220 --> 04:13:59.100
Sounds like babe, this is your sheepster academia

04:13:59.500 --> 04:14:01.500
Oh

04:14:02.220 --> 04:14:05.740
Yes, Johnny is Johnny's base. Love that woman

04:14:07.100 --> 04:14:09.100
How to pat cattle you just pat

04:14:09.900 --> 04:14:13.100
But someone that asked like oh if you could be another thing

04:14:13.100 --> 04:14:18.140
What would you be like a like animal and I don't honestly want to pick something

04:14:19.660 --> 04:14:22.940
Boomi can you chill the fuck out dude? Um

04:14:24.140 --> 04:14:27.020
I want to pick so I would pick something that like nobody

04:14:27.980 --> 04:14:32.140
Really ever like I like strong is because she's like a cuttlefish. She's not like an octopus

04:14:33.100 --> 04:14:37.740
Um, I would probably do some sort of like reptile because it's not a reptile girls

04:14:37.740 --> 04:14:42.700
There's like some snakes and there's some dino girls, but I'd like I think there was like one

04:14:43.820 --> 04:14:46.540
Crocodile girl. I think that was like a Japanese

04:14:47.340 --> 04:14:50.380
Talent and I was like yo, that's so cool

04:14:51.340 --> 04:14:53.340
Boomi

04:14:54.140 --> 04:14:57.500
I'm gonna create you if you don't behave. You can hear her run by go

04:14:58.540 --> 04:15:02.620
Because I shake the water bottle at him. Well, there's a billion axolotls. What are you talking about?

04:15:05.260 --> 04:15:09.740
Like coming out as a cook. Yeah, like like uh like when Madara was a cockroach. I was like

04:15:10.620 --> 04:15:16.780
Yo, I love bug girls bug girls out. So I'd either be a reptile or a bug girl 100 percent 100 percent

04:15:17.740 --> 04:15:19.740
Like I thought that was so cool that she was a cockroach

04:15:21.420 --> 04:15:23.420
Um Aunt Eater girl

04:15:26.220 --> 04:15:30.140
What type of bug um, I was thinking of like a praying mantis

04:15:31.580 --> 04:15:35.340
Like an orchid mantis then I saw that somebody actually had done that. Um

04:15:37.900 --> 04:15:40.940
What is that's broken hey

04:15:41.180 --> 04:15:43.180
Hey

04:15:43.500 --> 04:15:45.500
You galloped by um

04:15:46.380 --> 04:15:49.900
I've seen a centipede girl. I'm actually I love bugs

04:15:51.340 --> 04:15:54.220
Centipedes are the only bugs that freak me out and not even like

04:15:55.180 --> 04:15:59.580
It's like the silver like the house centipedes. I don't like house centipedes

04:16:00.380 --> 04:16:02.380
Google it if you don't know how centipedes

04:16:03.500 --> 04:16:06.620
Hydra be cool. I've seen there's like a Cerberus one

04:16:07.580 --> 04:16:11.020
Um, but I was kind of disappointed that she like didn't have multiple heads

04:16:11.740 --> 04:16:14.060
Or something. I would have liked to see that incorporated

04:16:14.780 --> 04:16:19.660
Slime girl. I've seen like a couple slime girls. There's there's definitely a couple spider girls

04:16:21.420 --> 04:16:22.700
Um

04:16:22.700 --> 04:16:30.780
My friend Nori, uh, I think she's just rebranded to an isopod which I'm like hell yeah isopods. There's so many cute isopods

04:16:31.500 --> 04:16:35.580
You might have to do like a bug stream where I just talk about isopods or just bugs

04:16:37.420 --> 04:16:43.820
Um, I used to have a little bug book and I would go around in my um, boomi. Are you behaving?

04:16:46.620 --> 04:16:51.420
Fia is playing with like some toy in the in a blanket and boomi's like mad

04:16:51.500 --> 04:16:56.940
Like boomi doesn't like it when the cats play independently like if rain is playing by herself or fias bang by himself

04:16:56.940 --> 04:16:59.900
He like has to insert himself and be a part of it. Um

04:17:01.260 --> 04:17:04.860
But this is a vtubing industry is you yeah, I don't know why everybody's like

04:17:05.340 --> 04:17:08.940
What's it called a ca-ma-ma me me me me me. I can ever pronounce it. But

04:17:09.740 --> 04:17:11.740
Yeah, everybody's like an animal person

04:17:12.220 --> 04:17:17.980
Um, what I would like to see more of is food based vtubers. I have seen a couple food based vtubers

04:17:18.540 --> 04:17:20.540
Um, I think that's funny

04:17:20.540 --> 04:17:22.300
Yes

04:17:22.300 --> 04:17:24.300
Yeah

04:17:26.780 --> 04:17:31.100
It's either like or like a unique mystical creature like I wanted um

04:17:32.140 --> 04:17:34.140
But when I was first conceptualizing

04:17:34.860 --> 04:17:38.420
my VTuber model, not Shibi, like prior to Shibi.

04:17:39.460 --> 04:17:41.620
This was made by Shani herself.

04:17:41.620 --> 04:17:45.700
I was birthed from the loins of Shone of Momhe.

04:17:45.700 --> 04:17:49.900
But I was thinking about like doing

04:17:49.900 --> 04:17:52.780
like Cthulhu Outer Worlds type character,

04:17:52.780 --> 04:17:54.980
like Outer Realms, and this would be like

04:17:54.980 --> 04:17:59.980
have a Hydra sort of like multiple tentacles, tails,

04:18:00.980 --> 04:18:03.140
like really like spooky, freaky,

04:18:03.140 --> 04:18:05.620
like I was tempted to do that.

04:18:05.620 --> 04:18:08.180
Yeah, like I should go off, see Waffles.

04:18:08.180 --> 04:18:09.020
Yeah.

04:18:11.700 --> 04:18:14.940
Rest in peace, Waffle and the Toaster, they miss her.

04:18:16.060 --> 04:18:18.940
She was a, she was a girl, she was a friend.

04:18:20.380 --> 04:18:21.300
Via Girl Girl.

04:18:21.300 --> 04:18:24.060
Yeah, like Mecha Girl, that'd be cool.

04:18:24.060 --> 04:18:26.100
I don't see, and that's another thing.

04:18:26.100 --> 04:18:29.300
A lot of artists don't, and the VTuber stuff,

04:18:29.300 --> 04:18:32.020
don't do Mecha unless it's like cybernetic

04:18:32.020 --> 04:18:34.700
and it's usually for guys for some reason.

04:18:34.700 --> 04:18:37.100
Like I don't see, or like there's some cybernetic girls

04:18:37.100 --> 04:18:38.980
or like androids and stuff,

04:18:38.980 --> 04:18:42.380
but like I want like a full ass transformer.

04:18:42.380 --> 04:18:43.860
Like give me a Voltron.

04:18:46.100 --> 04:18:47.820
Give me a pterodactyl.

04:18:51.340 --> 04:18:53.020
Honda Accord, Chan.

04:18:53.020 --> 04:18:55.340
I offer you an Accord.

04:18:55.340 --> 04:18:56.500
Just a Honda Accord.

04:18:59.220 --> 04:19:01.460
Chick stick, giant robots, you got that, right?

04:19:01.460 --> 04:19:02.820
That's why I like Robotech.

04:19:02.820 --> 04:19:04.900
Somebody who's mad, they're like,

04:19:04.900 --> 04:19:06.820
you don't like just Macross.

04:19:06.820 --> 04:19:10.220
Robotech was like the first super old anime

04:19:10.220 --> 04:19:11.780
my dad introduced me to.

04:19:13.300 --> 04:19:17.700
It was like Studio Ghibli stuff and then Robotech

04:19:17.700 --> 04:19:20.660
and then yeah, just like a bunch of other shit.

04:19:20.660 --> 04:19:22.220
Like I watched a lot of anime.

04:19:22.220 --> 04:19:25.060
I don't know why, I like blank on all the anime I've watched.

04:19:27.460 --> 04:19:28.660
What are you doing?

04:19:28.660 --> 04:19:29.660
What are you doing?

04:19:31.980 --> 04:19:33.660
Do you just want attention?

04:19:33.660 --> 04:19:35.380
Hi handsome.

04:19:35.380 --> 04:19:37.700
Mail on stream, it's my cat, relax everybody.

04:19:39.020 --> 04:19:41.020
He doesn't even have any balls.

04:19:41.020 --> 04:19:42.420
What are you doing big man?

04:19:43.660 --> 04:19:44.940
Are you trying to seduce me?

04:19:44.940 --> 04:19:46.980
Are you trying to get treats and pets?

04:19:46.980 --> 04:19:49.020
He's just dragging a toy across the floor.

04:19:52.900 --> 04:19:54.260
Have a good night, if you need to go.

04:19:54.260 --> 04:19:56.180
I know I've been streaming like for four hours

04:19:56.180 --> 04:20:00.260
so like if you guys need to leave, that's totally fine.

04:20:00.260 --> 04:20:04.780
I'm also a yapper and talker like strongy.

04:20:04.780 --> 04:20:07.540
I don't think I could, I can endurance yap.

04:20:07.540 --> 04:20:09.660
I can't endurance game like she does.

04:20:09.660 --> 04:20:13.180
Like if she's still playing, hold on, now I want to check.

04:20:13.180 --> 04:20:15.140
Is she still playing something?

04:20:15.140 --> 04:20:15.980
I bet she is.

04:20:22.180 --> 04:20:24.220
Forever be online.

04:20:24.220 --> 04:20:26.060
I generally, when I first met her,

04:20:26.060 --> 04:20:28.300
I'm like how do you get any work done?

04:20:28.300 --> 04:20:29.740
Cause you just play games.

04:20:29.780 --> 04:20:31.620
Like how do you have time to record stuff?

04:20:31.620 --> 04:20:33.340
She recorded like months and months and months

04:20:33.340 --> 04:20:34.780
of stuff in advance.

04:20:34.780 --> 04:20:36.420
Oh my gosh, she still is streaming.

04:20:41.420 --> 04:20:42.980
She's still streaming as I said,

04:20:42.980 --> 04:20:45.340
I love Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.

04:20:45.340 --> 04:20:47.460
That was the first one I played.

04:20:47.460 --> 04:20:49.020
Was there a streaming too?

04:20:49.020 --> 04:20:49.860
Cool.

04:20:55.580 --> 04:20:58.180
I was hoping for Ace Combat or Armored Core

04:20:58.180 --> 04:20:59.580
but it was just Assassin's Creed.

04:20:59.580 --> 04:21:01.700
I officially play Armored Core.

04:21:01.700 --> 04:21:03.700
What time are you in Merca's right now?

04:21:03.700 --> 04:21:08.340
It's 8 20 p.m. into Merca's Eastern Time.

04:21:08.340 --> 04:21:09.900
East Code, represent it.

04:21:11.340 --> 04:21:13.900
You just don't want to leave us as a good, yeah, I don't.

04:21:13.900 --> 04:21:17.140
Like after, I have to, I'll probably end stream soon

04:21:17.140 --> 04:21:18.700
cause I need to go eat dinner.

04:21:21.060 --> 04:21:25.460
And I'm going to be sad because I have no one to talk to.

04:21:25.620 --> 04:21:30.620
I have been like, I don't know what to do.

04:21:32.060 --> 04:21:33.340
I like, I have friends.

04:21:33.340 --> 04:21:35.540
I just don't feel like hanging out with them.

04:21:35.540 --> 04:21:38.580
I don't feel like, I have to go and get ready

04:21:38.580 --> 04:21:41.660
and get dressed and blah, like I have to do that tomorrow.

04:21:41.660 --> 04:21:43.940
Like tomorrow, just reminded me, I have to get up

04:21:43.940 --> 04:21:47.540
and go to like the store and go buy some alcohol

04:21:47.540 --> 04:21:48.780
cause I normally don't even drink

04:21:48.780 --> 04:21:51.180
but I just know it'd be funny to do a drunk stream.

04:21:52.180 --> 04:21:55.260
Where's my fellow Europeans starting to pass midnight?

04:21:57.100 --> 04:21:58.740
Go to bed, go to bed.

04:21:58.740 --> 04:22:02.660
I used to stream around like very European friendly times

04:22:02.660 --> 04:22:06.060
like 12 a.m. and sometimes 10 a.m.

04:22:07.940 --> 04:22:10.300
And the boomy, what are you doing?

04:22:10.300 --> 04:22:12.420
He's literally just staring at my window

04:22:12.420 --> 04:22:13.780
and just like tweaking out

04:22:13.780 --> 04:22:15.460
cause there's probably a bug on it.

04:22:15.460 --> 04:22:19.220
Hi handsome, what are you doing?

04:22:19.260 --> 04:22:21.180
He has like a cat tree that he sits on

04:22:21.180 --> 04:22:22.700
but he sticks his arm over the side.

04:22:22.700 --> 04:22:25.020
Like he's a truck driver and it's really funny to see.

04:22:25.020 --> 04:22:26.700
I'll probably post a picture of it.

04:22:29.500 --> 04:22:31.620
Hit him with a kitty, no he doesn't.

04:22:31.620 --> 04:22:34.740
Little, my cats don't answer to, they answer to

04:22:36.540 --> 04:22:38.340
my little mousy call.

04:22:40.780 --> 04:22:45.020
We dare not see the things only cats can see.

04:22:45.020 --> 04:22:46.780
Your longer streams go into the night a bit here

04:22:46.780 --> 04:22:47.620
but it's not too bad.

04:22:48.460 --> 04:22:53.460
I stream from like 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. before.

04:22:56.380 --> 04:22:58.540
Like I don't mind doing super long streams

04:22:58.540 --> 04:23:00.020
if I have the time for it.

04:23:00.940 --> 04:23:04.940
And then again, I can talk about anything for hours.

04:23:04.940 --> 04:23:09.940
As you can see, I've only played two hours of game

04:23:10.380 --> 04:23:12.540
and then there's two hours of yapping.

04:23:13.260 --> 04:23:17.940
My black cat sits in her cat stand

04:23:17.940 --> 04:23:19.780
with her back legs just dangling off.

04:23:19.780 --> 04:23:20.620
I love that.

04:23:20.620 --> 04:23:21.460
I love it.

04:23:21.460 --> 04:23:23.820
Like Fia likes to stick out her legs a lot.

04:23:23.820 --> 04:23:26.060
Like she's the most stretchy, floppy-est cat.

04:23:26.980 --> 04:23:29.580
When cats like just lay on their back

04:23:29.580 --> 04:23:32.220
and like stick their little feeties out and just kick them.

04:23:32.220 --> 04:23:33.500
It's great.

04:23:33.500 --> 04:23:35.580
69, 420 hours stream went.

04:23:35.580 --> 04:23:37.780
Ooh, it is my goal.

04:23:37.780 --> 04:23:39.020
I'm gonna say this right now.

04:23:39.020 --> 04:23:44.020
I would love to do an actual 24-hour stream.

04:23:44.980 --> 04:23:47.900
Like I will sleep on,

04:23:47.900 --> 04:23:51.100
I don't know if this YouTube allows sleeping on stream

04:23:51.100 --> 04:23:54.060
but like just like have a day.

04:23:54.060 --> 04:23:56.060
Like I don't know, like you cook, play games

04:23:57.700 --> 04:24:00.660
and maybe I'll do that for my birthday.

04:24:01.700 --> 04:24:04.820
And like, but actually do like a 24-hour don't-a-thon.

04:24:04.820 --> 04:24:06.060
And then like I'm sleeping

04:24:06.060 --> 04:24:07.380
and then I just have like my 3DO.

04:24:07.380 --> 04:24:11.580
So you guys can hear me like fart in my sleep and just, yeah.

04:24:11.580 --> 04:24:16.580
And I think that would be pretty, pretty fun.

04:24:18.820 --> 04:24:22.060
Just to like, or like I sleep with my 3DO

04:24:22.060 --> 04:24:22.900
pressed to my chest.

04:24:22.900 --> 04:24:24.460
So you guys can hear my heartbeat.

04:24:24.460 --> 04:24:25.620
Do I sleep talk?

04:24:26.700 --> 04:24:28.020
I don't know.

04:24:29.780 --> 04:24:33.620
I know that I snore from like what my parents have told me.

04:24:35.140 --> 04:24:36.580
I snore sometimes.

04:24:37.500 --> 04:24:40.220
My mom one time said that she freaked out

04:24:40.220 --> 04:24:42.540
because I stopped breathing in my sleep.

04:24:42.540 --> 04:24:44.500
She was like still awake at night,

04:24:44.500 --> 04:24:46.740
like watching her shows and I was sleeping.

04:24:46.740 --> 04:24:49.460
And then she heard me snore, my breath get caught

04:24:49.460 --> 04:24:51.620
and then just like, I choked but I didn't wake up.

04:24:51.620 --> 04:24:54.460
And so she was like, wake up, you're so exciting.

04:24:54.460 --> 04:24:55.940
And I was like, what the fuck?

04:24:55.940 --> 04:24:58.300
And she's like, I, you were not breathing.

04:24:58.300 --> 04:24:59.460
And I'm like, oh.

04:25:03.300 --> 04:25:04.340
Time to get a CPAP machine.

04:25:04.340 --> 04:25:05.180
Yeah, my dad is sleeping.

04:25:05.180 --> 04:25:06.580
I mean, I probably have a doom.

04:25:08.140 --> 04:25:08.980
Fucking.

04:25:11.220 --> 04:25:12.580
No, it's weird.

04:25:12.580 --> 04:25:13.420
It's really weird.

04:25:13.420 --> 04:25:14.540
I hate that.

04:25:14.540 --> 04:25:19.260
I would not want to sleep like a Darth Vader mask on me.

04:25:19.260 --> 04:25:21.340
It's mostly cause like, I just like,

04:25:21.340 --> 04:25:23.820
I think it's cause I sleep with my mouth open.

04:25:23.820 --> 04:25:26.660
All the little spiders can crawl inside.

04:25:26.660 --> 04:25:28.020
Have you already tested if the boob bug

04:25:28.020 --> 04:25:29.980
in the way of heartbeat ASMR?

04:25:29.980 --> 04:25:34.980
I just push my titties to each side of my body accordingly.

04:25:35.980 --> 04:25:39.980
And put it like, I have to like push my titties to like,

04:25:39.980 --> 04:25:41.900
I can't tell when I'm touching myself right now.

04:25:41.900 --> 04:25:43.740
And I just push my titties to the side

04:25:43.740 --> 04:25:48.740
and then I have to like mush my, the 3DO against my chest.

04:25:50.700 --> 04:25:52.380
She'd become cyborg.

04:25:52.380 --> 04:25:54.580
If I could just cut off my tits, that'd be great.

04:25:54.580 --> 04:25:56.740
I hate having tits, man.

04:25:56.740 --> 04:25:58.420
I'd rather have a fatter ass.

04:25:59.940 --> 04:26:03.380
But yeah, cause it's a boiler alert.

04:26:03.460 --> 04:26:07.140
There might be a heartbeat ASMR coming out soon.

04:26:08.980 --> 04:26:11.820
So I had to record a lot of heartbeat stuff.

04:26:11.820 --> 04:26:15.140
So I am already experienced with that.

04:26:15.140 --> 04:26:17.340
I have to like adjust myself,

04:26:17.340 --> 04:26:21.060
like a manager manages his, his ball sack.

04:26:21.060 --> 04:26:22.460
Now adjust my titty sack.

04:26:24.940 --> 04:26:26.300
Chibi, you can only stream 12 hours

04:26:26.300 --> 04:26:27.860
and Vaude has gone on YouTube.

04:26:29.460 --> 04:26:30.300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:26:30.300 --> 04:26:31.140
No, I know that.

04:26:31.140 --> 04:26:31.980
I know that.

04:26:31.980 --> 04:26:32.940
I'll do that.

04:26:32.940 --> 04:26:33.780
I'll do that.

04:26:35.140 --> 04:26:36.780
Does it like,

04:26:36.780 --> 04:26:39.100
does it like automatically end

04:26:39.100 --> 04:26:40.900
if you stream 12 hours?

04:26:40.900 --> 04:26:42.060
Does it just end?

04:26:43.580 --> 04:26:45.020
Like it doesn't just like be like,

04:26:45.020 --> 04:26:47.820
you're done and just cut you off or.

04:26:50.460 --> 04:26:51.780
I got a piss.

04:26:53.260 --> 04:26:54.260
I got a pee.

04:26:56.660 --> 04:26:58.580
Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.

04:26:58.580 --> 04:26:59.420
Hold on.

04:27:03.580 --> 04:27:05.140
Let's see.

04:27:05.140 --> 04:27:06.540
I think I might,

04:27:10.260 --> 04:27:13.180
might end here cause I do need to eat something.

04:27:13.180 --> 04:27:14.220
I'm streaming for four hours.

04:27:14.220 --> 04:27:16.180
It looks like Amy is still streaming.

04:27:17.340 --> 04:27:19.740
It's funny cause it looks like

04:27:19.740 --> 04:27:22.180
because I just started streaming.

04:27:22.180 --> 04:27:23.420
Strawny is still streaming.

04:27:23.420 --> 04:27:24.740
We are the overlap corporal

04:27:24.740 --> 04:27:27.580
cause we all stream for very, very long amount,

04:27:27.580 --> 04:27:28.620
amounts of time.

04:27:30.260 --> 04:27:31.380
The Vaude doesn't get saved.

04:27:31.380 --> 04:27:32.220
That's so weird.

04:27:33.940 --> 04:27:36.460
It stops recording the vlog.

04:27:36.460 --> 04:27:37.860
Oh, okay.

04:27:37.860 --> 04:27:38.700
Yeah.

04:27:38.700 --> 04:27:40.580
I'll probably go get something to eat.

04:27:40.580 --> 04:27:43.060
Let me send you guys to Azura

04:27:43.060 --> 04:27:46.180
cause I see that like she's just streaming.

04:27:46.180 --> 04:27:47.500
She just started.

04:27:47.500 --> 04:27:48.340
What the fuck?

04:27:49.220 --> 04:27:53.220
Oh, I just have major deja vu video details.

04:27:54.060 --> 04:27:56.220
Reader X are so weird.

04:27:58.940 --> 04:28:00.900
Like why can't I just raid?

04:28:00.900 --> 04:28:02.820
Jesus Christ, let me raid.

04:28:03.780 --> 04:28:06.380
A place forbidden.

04:28:06.380 --> 04:28:08.660
I don't know what that's about.

04:28:08.660 --> 04:28:12.340
But yeah, I hope you guys had a good time.

04:28:12.340 --> 04:28:14.380
Thank you for letting me out.

04:28:14.380 --> 04:28:15.340
I tend to overshare.

04:28:15.340 --> 04:28:17.340
So I'm slightly embarrassed right now.

04:28:17.340 --> 04:28:22.260
Yeah, have a good night.

04:28:24.020 --> 04:28:25.740
I'm trying to think of something insulting to say

04:28:25.740 --> 04:28:28.060
cause you know, to be the Dom on YouTube.

04:28:28.060 --> 04:28:28.900
I don't know.

04:28:29.340 --> 04:28:32.780
Oh my God, did you guys hear?

04:28:32.780 --> 04:28:34.460
My cat just hiss at each other.

04:28:37.460 --> 04:28:40.020
All right, later.

04:28:40.020 --> 04:28:41.740
Give a, give Azura my love.

04:28:41.740 --> 04:28:42.580
Bye bye.

04:28:50.780 --> 04:28:52.740
You guys still smell stinky.

04:28:58.900 --> 04:29:00.900
You guys still smell stinky.

04:29:00.900 --> 04:29:02.900
You guys still smell stinky.

04:29:02.900 --> 04:29:04.900
You guys still smell stinky.

04:29:04.900 --> 04:29:06.900
You guys still smell stinky.

04:29:06.900 --> 04:29:08.900
You guys still smell stinky.

04:29:08.900 --> 04:29:10.900
You guys still smell stinky.

04:29:10.900 --> 04:29:12.900
You guys still smell stinky.

04:29:12.900 --> 04:29:14.900
You guys still smell stinky.

04:29:14.900 --> 04:29:16.900
You guys still smell stinky.

04:29:16.900 --> 04:29:18.900
You guys still smell stinky.

04:29:18.900 --> 04:29:20.900
You guys still smell stinky.

04:29:20.900 --> 04:29:22.900
You guys still smell stinky.

04:29:22.900 --> 04:29:24.900
You guys still smell stinky.

04:29:24.900 --> 04:29:26.900
You guys still smell stinky.
