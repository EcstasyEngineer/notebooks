1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,540
knows

2
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:51,940
Hi, I'm a licensed dermatology provider from Cureology, answer a few questions, I'll look

3
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:55,940
at your skin and prescribe you a personalized cream.

4
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:56,940
Wow!

5
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:03,940
I wish we could watch the college football games we actually care about.

6
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:04,940
You can.

7
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:09,940
On ASPN with Slate, they have the kind of football that you love.

8
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,940
You can even choose and customize your channel lineup with Slate.

9
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,940
And you can watch it on your phone.

10
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:15,940
That's not so easy.

11
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,940
How do we get out of here?

12
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:18,940
Follow me.

13
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:19,940
I love this.

14
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:22,940
Yeah, that place was way too crowded.

15
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:27,940
Pre-pay and save with Season Pass and get the college football you care about.

16
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,940
Sling lets you do that.

17
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,940
Yeah.

18
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:23,940
Yeah.

19
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,940
Yeah.

20
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,940
Yeah.

21
00:04:52,940 --> 00:05:16,940
Hi, hello, hello.

22
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:20,940
Hello! Oh, I'm just charging. I'll grab them the second I'm eating first.

23
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:24,940
Hi! Hello everyone! Hi!

24
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:29,940
I started a little bit early because my door-gash was here, so I ran downstairs.

25
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:35,940
And I met a dog. They were cool. It was a cute five-month-year-old labradoodle puppy.

26
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:41,940
Adorable, sweet. Tried to take my food, but that's okay.

27
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,940
Hi! Hi!

28
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:51,940
When we started yelling when I came back, I was like, why are you so cocky?

29
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:56,940
Yeah, I'm in the subject-getting mood because Fia is doing so well.

30
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,940
She's actually just put her in the litter box. Let me check with her.

31
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:04,940
You might hear her speak when I pick her up.

32
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:09,940
Yeah. Yeah.

33
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:14,940
Yeah. Yeah.

34
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:19,940
Yeah, you're snuddled.

35
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:24,940
Yeah.

36
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:29,940
Yeah.

37
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:34,940
Yeah, she's been acting super cute.

38
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:39,940
And I can't get over it how cute she'd be acting.

39
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:45,940
Ah, so I got some...

40
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:49,940
Boomi wants that shrimp. He probably did.

41
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:54,940
She's gonna come over here.

42
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:59,940
I might have gotten too much food because I got sushi and then hibachi, so I'm not gonna finish this.

43
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:04,940
But it'll be fine. Thanks, Boomi.

44
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:08,940
It'll be fine.

45
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:13,940
She just knocked over her stuff on my desk. How can I help you?

46
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:17,940
I don't even know.

47
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:22,940
But I'll have leftovers for tomorrow.

48
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:27,940
Here, maybe I should put on... Let's do an impromptu hand cam.

49
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:31,940
Oh my God.

50
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,940
This is heavy.

51
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:40,940
I also got tempura cheesecake because it just sounded good.

52
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:44,940
I need a sloucher.

53
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,940
Here's one.

54
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:52,940
Okay.

55
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,940
Game audio loud. I got you.

56
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:07,940
Yep, tempura cheesecake. I saw it. I never had that before. It sounded good.

57
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:11,940
So I'm like, you know what?

58
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,940
We're doing it.

59
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:20,940
We're treating ourselves today.

60
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:25,940
Let me grab my chamois.

61
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:35,940
Where's my chamois?

62
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:42,940
Oh my God. So many wires.

63
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:48,940
The really loud whistle of Mr. Chimes.

64
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,940
True. Sorry.

65
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,940
I don't have my headphones on so I couldn't tell how loud the audio levels were.

66
00:08:54,940 --> 00:09:07,940
I apologize. I apologize.

67
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,940
Let me just untangle my...

68
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,940
Why did this get so twisted?

69
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:19,940
What have you guys been up to today? How's it been going?

70
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,940
What's new?

71
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,940
Did you eat today, Harlet?

72
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:32,940
Did you work hard today?

73
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:38,940
Turn on the freaking lights so I can see what I'm doing.

74
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,940
Let me move my keys.

75
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:57,940
Remind me my keys are beside my desk. I will forget.

76
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:06,940
A little small food hand cam. I still have the gum full of stuff out.

77
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:16,940
You took your lunch break early? Oh my gosh.

78
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:22,940
Oh my God. The temporary cheesecake though.

79
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:27,940
I think it was because somebody was making cheesecake. I really wanted cheesecake.

80
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:32,940
I'm definitely not eating all this. Holy crap. This is so much food.

81
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,940
What the hell?

82
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:43,940
I don't even know what this is. What is this? It's rice.

83
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:48,940
This is... Oh my God. I forgot. I got myself a sprite.

84
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:53,940
We're treating ourselves today with some soda. Normally I drink salto water.

85
00:10:53,940 --> 00:11:00,940
And of course, Boomi's here to inspect.

86
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:04,940
Where did all this come from? Doordash?

87
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:10,940
I ordered two rolls in hibachi and I think my eyes were bigger than my stomach.

88
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:20,940
What did you get for Boomi? He has a roof over his head and he just ate cat food so he's fine.

89
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:24,940
Holy... guys.

90
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,940
I shouldn't have gotten the hibachi.

91
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:31,940
There's also... there's also like... why did they give me so much stuff?

92
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:38,940
What is this? Is this miso soup? And a shit ton of soy sauce? Oh my God.

93
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:44,940
That is a lot. We stan American portion sizes. Yes.

94
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:51,940
They gave me two sets of utensils which means they think that I'm two people.

95
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:55,940
Because they're like, wow, this is a lot of food. This has to be for two people.

96
00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:00,940
I didn't know it would be this much.

97
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:11,940
Damn girl, you sure eat. I'm not finishing all this. I'll tell you that right now.

98
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,940
Yeah, my furthest person number two. I'm probably just gonna eat the sushi right now.

99
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:20,940
And I'll save this... the hibachi. Let's try it actually.

100
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,940
Let's do a little taste test, ladies and gentlemen.

101
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:29,940
Oh, that'd be looking delectable. Am I right?

102
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,940
A little bit of scrimp. They gave me three pieces of scrimp. What is up with that?

103
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:38,940
Little...

104
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:42,940
Mmm!

105
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,940
That looks... oh my God. That's delicious.

106
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,940
Alright, let's do a little... I got like, sauce everywhere. It's fine.

107
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:56,940
A little bit of... a little bit of steak. I get my medium.

108
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:00,940
Oh.

109
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,940
Lord, that is delicious.

110
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,940
Okay.

111
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:13,940
Veggies, because you know we gotta stay balanced.

112
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:19,940
This fork sucks.

113
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:23,940
Unofficial mukbang.

114
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:28,940
I just got sauce all over myself. It's fine. I just spilled it all over my desk.

115
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:32,940
You can see it there.

116
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:36,940
Okie dokie. I don't know where to put this. I gotta go put this on the counter.

117
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,940
I'm also not gonna eat all this, I don't think.

118
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,940
Although I am hungry, I haven't eaten all day.

119
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:52,940
It is 7 p.m. and your girl has not eaten.

120
00:13:52,940 --> 00:14:02,940
I know for a fact that he's gonna try to steal this. Go away!

121
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,940
Damn, this bitch can eat. She th-

122
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,940
How do you think I got something for eyes, bro? I'm just kidding.

123
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:15,940
Looks like too much food for me to consume without being sick.

124
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:20,940
Welcome to here, member.

125
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,940
Why did you not eat earlier? You were tweeting 12 hours ago.

126
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:27,940
Because I get distracted?

127
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,940
I don't know what to tell you.

128
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,940
Now you guys can make fun of my chopstick- chopski-

129
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:45,940
And I'll skee skee skee my chopstick skills. I can't open this because of my nails.

130
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:49,940
Holy crap, this is huge. I thought it was gonna be like that and that.

131
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:56,940
Like just like small.

132
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:00,940
Hi, Shibi. It's me, Funtime Freddy. And welcome to Faith The Unholy Trinity.

133
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:12,940
Was this to constitute as a girl dinner? Nah, this is a man dinner.

134
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:20,940
Holy balls, you're brown. Nori! Hi, Nori. Yeah, I'm brown. Aren't you proud of me?

135
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,940
Look at that.

136
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:34,940
She got tempura shrimp and then Connie, you know?

137
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:41,940
Mm-hmm. Oh my god.

138
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:45,940
Mwah, chef's kiss. That's delicious.

139
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:58,940
And then I believe this is avocado, shrimp, and eel with a little bit of crunch.

140
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:03,940
Mwah. Mm-hmm.

141
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:07,940
It's really good.

142
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:12,940
I'm delicious, so.

143
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:16,940
Chat boxes froze. It always freezes.

144
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:25,940
I need to figure out how to get a different chat for it. I might just pull up the window and stick it in there.

145
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:34,940
Oh, there's Tobiko in it, too.

146
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:43,940
Yes, I wear the pants in the relationship.

147
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:48,940
What if I... Yeah, let's do a little... Let's pop out the chat.

148
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:52,940
I want to get a new chat widget.

149
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:56,940
Viewers are excited about a streamer's stash powers, delicious food delivery, and discuss their own eating habits.

150
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:05,940
Viewers are inspired to order takeout while others are trying to eat healthier. Thanks, AI.

151
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:12,940
Okay.

152
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:18,940
Let me... I think it was...

153
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:27,940
This one.

154
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:33,940
Oh my god. Look at you guys. Ah.

155
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,940
Look at you. You're so cute.

156
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:58,940
I have the chopsticks in my mouth like a walrus. You can't see it.

157
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:04,940
That works.

158
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:12,940
There we go. Looks like weird, but it's fine.

159
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:17,940
Do you want me to feed you?

160
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,940
I don't actually like putting soy sauce and stuff.

161
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:25,940
Well, I will. I occasionally will, but I usually don't.

162
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:31,940
So, open wide. Say ah. Ah. Ah, madam's going to feed you.

163
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:37,940
Remember, you're supposed to eat sushi in one bite.

164
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,940
Ready?

165
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:50,940
Here comes the plane.

166
00:18:50,940 --> 00:19:00,940
How is it?

167
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:12,940
Mommy, baby's you on a date. ASMR role play.

168
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,940
Why is it spicy?

169
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:19,940
A shrimp. It's getting... I mean, a shrimp. The sprite.

170
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:24,940
Please, God. Delicious.

171
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:30,940
Don't really better cover your mouth when you burp. Don't burp in my face now.

172
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,940
Oh, this one's falling apart. Here, I'll get you a better one.

173
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:45,940
I'll get you a better one, baby girl.

174
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:51,940
You burped me in that.

175
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:57,940
All right. Open wide. I'm trying to get you a good piece.

176
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:01,940
This role is falling apart. I apologize.

177
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:08,940
All right. Open wide. Come on. It's falling out of my hand.

178
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,940
Go on now.

179
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:15,940
Are you ready? Here, I'm going to help you. Open your mouth.

180
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:22,940
Good. Good. Nice. Okay. Perfect.

181
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:27,940
How does that taste, my sweet little boy? Do you like the food?

182
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:40,940
All handsome?

183
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:44,940
What? Like my what?

184
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:53,940
Look at it on my hand.

185
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:58,940
Oh, my God.

186
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:02,940
You say my kuchi is fishy, Nori.

187
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,940
Here, you can eat this piece out of my hand.

188
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:08,940
Like the dog you are. Go on.

189
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:14,940
Go on. Do it.

190
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,940
And bark thank you afterwards.

191
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:41,940
Okay.

192
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:45,940
I'm so used to hand peeing.

193
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:48,940
I'm surprised Bumi's not like harassing me right now.

194
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,940
Oh, he's sleeping. What are you doing, big man?

195
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,940
Your butt looks huge from here.

196
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:59,940
Why is your mouth? You look so dumb right now.

197
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,940
He's looking back at me.

198
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,940
Can I take a picture?

199
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:11,940
Hold on. Bumi, don't move.

200
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:17,940
Bumi.

201
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:25,940
He looks so goofy, handsome boy.

202
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:29,940
He's literally, he looked at me with like cross eyes.

203
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:38,940
His mouth open and his badonkadonk just like out.

204
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,940
Yeah, his gya, he was sticking out his gya for the Rizzler.

205
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,940
That's all I'm going to say.

206
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:51,940
I think this one is the tail, so I'll just eat that with my hands.

207
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,940
Okay, it's your turn to feed me now.

208
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,940
Can you feed me?

209
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:07,940
Eat the wasabi.

210
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:10,940
No, it's like, it's not good wasabi, so it's not that crazy.

211
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:13,940
Like usually I can't handle wasabi.

212
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:18,940
Give her snort wasabi? Yeah.

213
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:22,940
All right, feed me.

214
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:25,940
Don't, don't hit my cheek with it.

215
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:37,940
Thank you.

216
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:43,940
Thank you. Oh my gosh.

217
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:49,940
The wishes. Thank you.

218
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,940
I got nonexistent hands.

219
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:57,940
Swabbing her hands. Where'd her hands go?

220
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:02,940
You guys spoil me.

221
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:08,940
Technically, you guys got me the sushi, so.

222
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,940
Because you pay for me to live.

223
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,940
So thank you. Thank you for dinner.

224
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:15,940
You're so sweet.

225
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,940
Oh, you're so sweet to me.

226
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:18,940
You're so good to me.

227
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,940
I don't deserve you.

228
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:24,940
How could I? How could I have someone like you?

229
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:45,940
All to myself.

230
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:57,940
My penis, I slam my penis in the car door.

231
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:02,940
Yeah, Nori's saying the quiet part out loud.

232
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,940
You didn't split the bill for dinner?

233
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,940
Oh, no, we split the bill.

234
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:18,940
I'm kind of like the one with the most tall people.

235
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:22,940
9, 9, 9, 9.

236
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:35,940
It's the autism, your honor.

237
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:42,940
What's the game about?

238
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:45,940
So you're a priest.

239
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,940
That's it.

240
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,940
You're a priest and you're fighting demons.

241
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:52,940
That's it.

242
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,940
At least that's what I know.

243
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,940
And it's funny because I've seen this entire game play before.

244
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:01,940
I just don't remember any of it.

245
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:10,940
On my device, this is revolver.

246
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:14,940
No, it's a squirt gun.

247
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,940
Who's Chibi?

248
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,940
I'm Chibi.

249
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,940
Game is about mortis.

250
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:21,940
Did you make it for the pregame?

251
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:22,940
Yeah, we're on a dinner date right now.

252
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,940
I can't believe you're late to our dinner date.

253
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,940
How could you do that?

254
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:27,940
Should BB play it?

255
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,940
BB already played it.

256
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:41,940
I'm trying to avoid playing into BB too much because I think people will want me to become a nun.

257
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:55,940
And for reasons, because there's a nun in Gen 4.

258
00:26:55,940 --> 00:27:00,940
John Faith defeats Gary on Holy Trinity.

259
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:01,940
Shot caller.

260
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,940
Yeah, there's no shot caller today.

261
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:07,940
Yeah, I don't want to get typecast precisely.

262
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:08,940
Eating a cheesesteak?

263
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,940
Good.

264
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,940
Nori, you're in.

265
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:15,940
I'm hiring you right now.

266
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:21,940
Like I have any power to do so.

267
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,940
Nori, I don't know.

268
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:31,940
I would laugh trying to listen to you record something for Patreon because I don't think you'll be able to take it seriously.

269
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:34,940
Nori for Gen 4, guys.

270
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:38,940
Nori for Gen 4.

271
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,940
Nori for Gen 4.

272
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:45,940
You bought the shot caller for yourself?

273
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,940
You got a shot caller?

274
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,940
Ooh, yeah, it took forever to come in for me.

275
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:52,940
It took me like a month.

276
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:57,940
Wow, it's so big.

277
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:00,940
Wait, I have to do it in Nori's voice.

278
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:18,940
Wow, it's so big.

279
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,940
And what does it mean?

280
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:28,940
I don't record a lot.

281
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,940
Guys, the sushi is hitting.

282
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:36,940
I can't find where the other parts of the roll are.

283
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:41,940
I'm like craving eel.

284
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:42,940
You know what?

285
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:46,940
I should do one of those pregnancy audios like Strawny did for the entire week leading up to it.

286
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:47,940
I don't know.

287
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:50,940
I'm going to pretend that I have really bad cravings.

288
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,940
My friend's cat is named Gibi.

289
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,940
Oh, that's funny.

290
00:28:55,940 --> 00:29:01,940
A pinky in the brain.

291
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:02,940
What?

292
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:03,940
Don't look at it.

293
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:04,940
Don't look.

294
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,940
I think it's everybody's favorite emo.

295
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:18,940
What's that one?

296
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:23,940
Here's a character named Sigma.

297
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:24,940
Oh my God.

298
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:30,940
A collab between Ambien Nori is doing brain rot memes.

299
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:33,940
Well, also like dorking your peanuts.

300
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,940
That'd be so funny.

301
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:42,940
Those cravings being Pee Pee McGee.

302
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:46,940
Two is some bumps and I'm going to be a dad.

303
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:50,940
Do a fancy stream right before the party.

304
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:51,940
Oh my God.

305
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:54,940
Why is that a good idea though?

306
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:57,940
It intimidates me because she's blonde.

307
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:58,940
Hello, she's ginger.

308
00:29:58,940 --> 00:29:59,940
And second, I'm right here.

309
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,940
I'm also blonde.

310
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,940
And you want to eat her hair?

311
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:12,940
It looks like, like twirly candy.

312
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:17,940
You're black.

313
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:18,940
My nails are cute.

314
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:24,940
They're blue.

315
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,940
A lot of floof my rabbit ears.

316
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:27,940
No touchy.

317
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:30,940
They're sensitive.

318
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,940
Especially by tail.

319
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:32,940
My tail is also very sensitive.

320
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:39,940
People forget that I'm a bunny girl with a tail.

321
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,940
I'm out of sprite.

322
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:45,940
Can we touch the tail?

323
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:50,940
Only during buckshot roulette.

324
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:54,940
Looks at you.

325
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,940
Do you know that bunnies actually have very long tails?

326
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:57,940
Yes.

327
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:58,940
I think someone mentioned that.

328
00:30:58,940 --> 00:30:59,940
And then I looked it up.

329
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,940
And I was like, what the hell?

330
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,940
Bunnies have super long tails.

331
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:08,940
They're just like, tuck it in.

332
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:12,940
My ears are not handlebars.

333
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,940
What is that?

334
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:21,940
What does the hedgehog stuff mean?

335
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:22,940
They're two to three inches.

336
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,940
They're tucking on the fluff.

337
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:31,940
Is your Bible bigger than a bunny tail?

338
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:40,940
Oh.

339
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:50,940
I like to pull.

340
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,940
Really?

341
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:53,940
Really?

342
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:54,940
That's interesting.

343
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,940
They tuck it in their bunny waistbands.

344
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,940
How many kids would this be now?

345
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,940
I have zero children besides my cats.

346
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,940
You want that?

347
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:04,940
Here.

348
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:05,940
Here.

349
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:06,940
Take.

350
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:07,940
Take.

351
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:08,940
Ah.

352
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:09,940
Good, good, good.

353
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:10,940
Chew.

354
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:11,940
Swallow.

355
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:14,940
Swallow it.

356
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:20,940
Good job.

357
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:25,940
Little pocket Bible.

358
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,940
Puppy in my pocket.

359
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:36,940
Be be in my pocket.

360
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:37,940
Yeah.

361
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:40,940
I decided because I'm like, I don't want to postpone stream so I can eat.

362
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:44,940
So let me just eat with you.

363
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:48,940
Make it a little, a little dinner date.

364
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:49,940
Good, good.

365
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,940
You guys are so well behaved today.

366
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:52,940
Thank you.

367
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:57,940
I need to burp.

368
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:58,940
That was solid.

369
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:04,940
You guys didn't hear that though.

370
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:08,940
I am eating nuts in a Gatorade.

371
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:09,940
Okay.

372
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:15,940
Female hyenas get the really shit end of the stick.

373
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:20,940
I'm doing okay.

374
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:21,940
Okay.

375
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:22,940
Okay.

376
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:23,940
Yeah.

377
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:24,940
Don't starve.

378
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:25,940
Don't starve like I did.

379
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:43,940
You got it all over my shirt.

380
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:46,940
This is messy and I just vacuumed today.

381
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:53,940
And when I say I just vacuumed, I mean I turned on Zumba and he zoomed around.

382
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:54,940
Did I get down my shirt?

383
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:55,940
Oh my God.

384
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:56,940
It did.

385
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:57,940
Are you kidding me, bro?

386
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:58,940
What is that?

387
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:02,940
I got it all over me.

388
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:07,940
I got a Hoover my own boobs.

389
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:12,940
I can't.

390
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:13,940
Delicious.

391
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:18,940
It's in my, it's in the, the bitty crack.

392
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:19,940
I can't get this.

393
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:20,940
Oh my God.

394
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:21,940
Okay.

395
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:28,940
I'm going to have to vacuum again.

396
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:32,940
Shoeshee flavor.

397
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:33,940
All right.

398
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,940
Well, I'm happy I put this napkin down.

399
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:40,940
This is a good call on my, on my.

400
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:47,940
No, I just show it here when she just moves everybody out the way.

401
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,940
Boop sweat.

402
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,940
New fantasy unlocked.

403
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,940
Eating food off me.

404
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,940
That'd be a good script actually.

405
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:04,940
And just like one thing leads to another and then.

406
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:05,940
She be was mine first.

407
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,940
She's not wrong.

408
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,940
I've set up a four nor is the one when I was super small.

409
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:16,940
It gave me a chance and she lifted me to greater heights.

410
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:22,940
There's Toby go all over my desk.

411
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:32,940
Oh, no.

412
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:42,940
Oh, no.

413
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:48,940
We're all out of dishes and I have all this sushi to serve.

414
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:55,940
Oh, no.

415
00:35:55,940 --> 00:36:06,940
What am I going to do with all these plates of sushi?

416
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:11,940
You guys get it for an adult.

417
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:27,940
You guys ate all this.

418
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:35,940
I'm literally a little kid, John.

419
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:39,940
What does she watch out?

420
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:40,940
Oh, that's cool news for you.

421
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:43,940
Someone I talked to in discord randomly sent me your channel saying he loved your stuff.

422
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,940
He was surprised when I told him I was already here.

423
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:46,940
That's awesome.

424
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:47,940
That's so amazing.

425
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:51,940
I'm so glad people like, um, I, I, that's like that.

426
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:57,940
That's like, I think the second time someone said that to me, like they were like, Oh, someone sent me you, but I already was watching you.

427
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:58,940
And I was like, what?

428
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:01,940
That's so funny.

429
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:08,940
Me and them doing something right.

430
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:09,940
Fire, fire, fire.

431
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:13,940
Couldn't find the emoji.

432
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,940
Look at the AI.

433
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:18,940
Hold on.

434
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:22,940
What the AI saying, what the dog doing?

435
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:32,940
I don't know if it's going to work because I popped out chat.

436
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:33,940
No, he's protective.

437
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:37,940
She beat and does not want to share.

438
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,940
That's funny.

439
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:47,940
That is indeed a good, a good summary.

440
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:52,940
I agree with that summary.

441
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,940
Okay, last piece.

442
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:55,940
It's for you.

443
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:59,940
You can have it because you've been so good.

444
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:05,940
You can have the last piece here.

445
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:08,940
There you go.

446
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:11,940
You like it?

447
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,940
Yeah.

448
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:29,940
Good.

449
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:34,940
Fan girl fan.

450
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:35,940
He's strict.

451
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:38,940
Do you even know the name of my band?

452
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:42,940
They all love me like they want to hold hands.

453
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:46,940
All because I'm she be cotton bum.

454
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:47,940
Girl failure.

455
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:48,940
Dom of gen one.

456
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:56,940
Be a lure.

457
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:57,940
Oh my God.

458
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,940
Stacey.

459
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:59,940
It's Eminem.

460
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:03,940
I never had the lyrics go.

461
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:10,940
Please won't you please let me suck your rocks.

462
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:19,940
I love the crunchy bit.

463
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,940
That would be so funny.

464
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:25,940
No, there's no more spline.

465
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:36,940
Okay, cool.

466
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:37,940
Was it?

467
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:44,940
I didn't listen to his latest album.

468
00:39:44,940 --> 00:40:03,940
Vangirl.

469
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:04,940
All right.

470
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:07,940
I want to take a bite of this temporary cheesecake.

471
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,940
Let's see if I can eat it.

472
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:14,940
I still have freakin' stuff in my boot.

473
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:19,940
Let me put this in the fridge.

474
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:26,940
This is a lot of food.

475
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:42,940
I mean, it's time to crack a cold one for the boys.

476
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,940
Oi, oi, oi.

477
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:53,940
Omelander stormy sun.

478
00:40:53,940 --> 00:41:04,940
We recycle in this household.

479
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,940
Are you recycling?

480
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,940
You better be recycling, harem.

481
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:15,940
You better be separating your plastic and your glass and your cardboard.

482
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:20,940
These chicks don't even know the name of my band.

483
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:21,940
Who's Eminem?

484
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,940
That's a good joke, Nori.

485
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:27,940
You freaking...

486
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:28,940
Oh my God, Nori.

487
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:34,940
I'm going to kill you in Minecraft.

488
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:37,940
Ladies and gentlemen, sheltered woman right here.

489
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:39,940
Sheltered baby.

490
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:42,940
All right, guys.

491
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:46,940
Let's see.

492
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:47,940
I'm recycling.

493
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:48,940
I'm American.

494
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:49,940
I'm also American.

495
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:50,940
Ooh.

496
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:53,940
I hate maraschino cherries, but ooh.

497
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,940
Ooh.

498
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:59,940
Architect Rose eating good tonight.

499
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:05,940
It goes all to my thighs and my booba.

500
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,940
Ooh.

501
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:09,940
What the hell?

502
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:11,940
Do I have to cut this?

503
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:16,940
I need a knife.

504
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:17,940
I don't like cherries.

505
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,940
I don't like maraschino.

506
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:20,940
I can't pronounce it.

507
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,940
You know what I'm talking about.

508
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:23,940
Maraschino?

509
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:24,940
Maraschino?

510
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:25,940
Machinima?

511
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:27,940
I don't like machinima.

512
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:34,940
Machinima cherries are not my favorite.

513
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:35,940
Oh, good.

514
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:37,940
I hope it goes well, Charlie.

515
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:44,940
Thank you for the member update.

516
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,940
All right.

517
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:57,940
Let's try it.

518
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,940
Cross section.

519
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:06,940
Cross section doko.

520
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:16,940
Oh my God.

521
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:22,940
Holy crap.

522
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:25,940
That is one of the best things I've ever tasted.

523
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:26,940
You want to bite?

524
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:27,940
I'll let you bite.

525
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:28,940
Hold on.

526
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:32,940
Let me cut you off a little bite, sweetheart.

527
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:33,940
It's very good.

528
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:34,940
I think you'll like it.

529
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:37,940
The graham cracker is exceptional with the tempura.

530
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:41,940
This is very hard to cut in this little bowl.

531
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:42,940
Hello?

532
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:46,940
Can I cut this off?

533
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:48,940
I'm struggling with this piece.

534
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:51,940
Okay.

535
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:55,940
Here comes the plane.

536
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:57,940
Here he comes.

537
00:43:57,940 --> 00:43:59,940
There he is.

538
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:02,940
There you go.

539
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:11,940
You didn't have to take the fork with you, too.

540
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,940
What do you think?

541
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:21,940
I think it's pretty delicious.

542
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:24,940
I think it's pretty delicious, guys.

543
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:27,940
Get those cherries out.

544
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:28,940
I'll eat them.

545
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:29,940
I just don't want to eat them right now.

546
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:30,940
This is really good.

547
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:31,940
I needed something sweet.

548
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:36,940
I don't have anything sweet.

549
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:37,940
Cheesecake is delicious.

550
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:38,940
I remember I used to hate cheesecake.

551
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:44,940
I don't know what was wrong with me.

552
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:52,940
No, cheesecake doesn't make my tummy hurt.

553
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,940
Delicious shows a certain streamer website.

554
00:44:54,940 --> 00:45:01,940
I should have had milk with this.

555
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:04,940
You can get your daily dose of microplastic somewhere else,

556
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:06,940
you goofball.

557
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:09,940
Did you say praise the Lord before eating?

558
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:14,940
I don't know, did I?

559
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:15,940
I'm a pagan.

560
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:16,940
That doesn't make any sense.

561
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:19,940
How could I?

562
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:23,940
Although I say praise a lot, you know, as one does.

563
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:26,940
Yeah, I never liked cheesecake.

564
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:28,940
Did you eat cheesecake with your sister?

565
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:31,940
Okay, there's still like little fish eggs in my mouth,

566
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:35,940
so I just popped one and it was kind of weird.

567
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:36,940
Can I eat the lid?

568
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:37,940
Of course.

569
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:39,940
Here you go.

570
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:40,940
Here's a lid.

571
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:42,940
Oh, oh, you really took that.

572
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:45,940
All right.

573
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:47,940
Okay.

574
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:55,940
Got to get the palate cleanse.

575
00:45:55,940 --> 00:46:08,940
I like how you spoke palate as in like a wood palate.

576
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:10,940
I need to burp.

577
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:12,940
More of a cake girlie or a pie girlie?

578
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:14,940
I'm more of a pie girlie.

579
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:15,940
I love me some apple pie.

580
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,940
I make really good apple pie.

581
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:18,940
And I make really good apple crisp.

582
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:22,940
Hold on, I got a burp for you.

583
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:24,940
Solid.

584
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:25,940
Solid.

585
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:27,940
Tell me that wasn't solid, bro.

586
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:32,940
Tell me.

587
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:36,940
Eight out of ten.

588
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:37,940
All right.

589
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:38,940
Hold on.

590
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:39,940
I'll give you a better one.

591
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:41,940
I need tens across the board.

592
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:43,940
Week?

593
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:55,940
Hold on, hold on.

594
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:58,940
What about that?

595
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:03,940
I got a smell across the screen.

596
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:05,940
Six out of ten.

597
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:09,940
Seven.

598
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:14,940
I was like, I think the only time I got a ten out of ten was when I did the thing during

599
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:17,940
Wolf Quest when I was drinking that Korean soda.

600
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:20,940
And I just burped for like a minute.

601
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:22,940
That's made into a short, by the way.

602
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:29,940
It'll be up in a couple of days.

603
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:32,940
I can't wait for people to call me a fat lard because I eat food on stream.

604
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:33,940
I don't care.

605
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:34,940
I am hungry.

606
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:38,940
I haven't eaten all day.

607
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:53,940
This is a big bite.

608
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:55,940
I prefer apple pie.

609
00:47:55,940 --> 00:48:01,940
I'm not a huge pumpkin pie fan.

610
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:03,940
Is Johnny making a cake short?

611
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:04,940
I don't know.

612
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:06,940
I think she's highlighting that.

613
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:10,940
This is a member stream, so I have to figure it out.

614
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:15,940
But I know that would probably go freaking viral.

615
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:18,940
Johnny was like, what did you do on stream?

616
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:20,940
Can you grab me?

617
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:23,940
Can you give me download the mod for me?

618
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:25,940
Wait, I can just go into your account and do it myself?

619
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:26,940
Thank you.

620
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:32,940
That's literally what she said.

621
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:33,940
Yes.

622
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:34,940
I prefer crust.

623
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:40,940
Although cheesecake, I like the crust, like the graham cracker crust.

624
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:41,940
Does it say so cake?

625
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:42,940
Yeah, you're right.

626
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:47,940
It was just a say so big cake baking stream.

627
00:48:47,940 --> 00:49:00,940
This was slapped with ice cream.

628
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:01,940
You never had cheesecake nori?

629
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:09,940
I feel like you wouldn't like it just knowing you.

630
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:10,940
Yes.

631
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:19,940
I like really, really crispy apple crisp with really good crumble and an ice cream.

632
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:25,940
Probably looks like pumpkin chocolate.

633
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:31,940
This isn't really what cheesecake looks like.

634
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:32,940
Lemon rink.

635
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:33,940
I don't really like lemon things.

636
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:37,940
The only lemon thing I've eaten that I actually liked was my mom's lemon squares.

637
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:40,940
My mom is a really good baker.

638
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:42,940
I can't cut this.

639
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:45,940
It's just a mess now.

640
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:46,940
Whatever.

641
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:47,940
That's as good as it's going to get.

642
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:49,940
This looks fucking disgusting.

643
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:52,940
There we go.

644
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:53,940
Tres leches.

645
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:55,940
Oh, don't even get me started on tres leches.

646
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:57,940
I fucking love tres leches.

647
00:49:57,940 --> 00:49:58,940
Cake.

648
00:49:58,940 --> 00:49:59,940
Oh my God.

649
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:00,940
Mmm.

650
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:09,940
Mmm hmm.

651
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:10,940
Say it right.

652
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:11,940
You know I'm not Spanish.

653
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:13,940
How am I going to say it right?

654
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:14,940
Tres leches.

655
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:15,940
Tres leches.

656
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:16,940
Tres leches.

657
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:17,940
It's funny.

658
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:21,940
Some lady was the woman with the dog that I talked about at the beginning of the stream.

659
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:25,940
She was talking to me in Spanish and I'm just like, I don't know what you're saying.

660
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:26,940
Oh my God.

661
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:33,940
That's so funny though.

662
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:34,940
Dios mío.

663
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:37,940
I can't.

664
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:39,940
Free milks.

665
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:47,940
One milk, two milk, three milk.

666
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:49,940
Favorite ice cream.

667
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:52,940
I like Oreo cookie ice cream alone by itself.

668
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:55,940
However, I'm a huge cold stone fan.

669
00:50:55,940 --> 00:51:01,940
So I like birthday cake remix is my favorite flavor.

670
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:02,940
Don't laugh at me.

671
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:03,940
What are you guys?

672
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:11,940
Don't look at me like that.

673
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:12,940
I love cold stone.

674
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:14,940
There's not one any near me though.

675
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:19,940
There's only my near my grandparents because they're in the south for some.

676
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:22,940
I don't know why there's like none up here, but it's, I don't know.

677
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:23,940
Maybe because it's New England.

678
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:32,940
They're just like, it's cold enough.

679
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:33,940
Cotton candy with Reese's peanut butter.

680
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:34,940
That sounds disgusting.

681
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:37,940
I don't like cotton candy.

682
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:41,940
It's too sweet because it's literally, you know, sugar.

683
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:42,940
Okay.

684
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:51,940
Now I'm full.

685
00:51:51,940 --> 00:52:00,940
Never had stewards.

686
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:03,940
Cold stone, my beloved.

687
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:05,940
They're slowly coming up here.

688
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:06,940
Maybe.

689
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:10,940
I hate pistachio ice cream here.

690
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:11,940
Disgusting.

691
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:13,940
And mint chocolate chip.

692
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:17,940
What is wrong with people who like green ice cream for real?

693
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:21,940
I need to take out the trash.

694
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:31,940
I'm mean.

695
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:33,940
Like mint chip.

696
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:35,940
Mint chocolate chip tastes disgusting.

697
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:36,940
Come for me.

698
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:37,940
Come for me.

699
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:38,940
Do it.

700
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:39,940
Come at me, bro.

701
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:40,940
Come at me.

702
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:41,940
Hold on.

703
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:42,940
Hold on.

704
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:43,940
I'll show you.

705
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:46,940
I was going to be like, come at me, bro.

706
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:47,940
Come at me, bro.

707
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:48,940
Do it.

708
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:49,940
Do it.

709
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:50,940
Fight me.

710
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:51,940
Fight me right now.

711
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:52,940
Do it.

712
00:52:52,940 --> 00:53:02,940
I'm grabbing my watch.

713
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:13,940
Hey, I'm about to scorn me with you.

714
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:25,940
Take the baby.

715
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:32,940
Baby has been taken.

716
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:40,940
We turn off the light so it's not in your face.

717
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:47,940
This bed is too big.

718
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:53,940

757
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:13,940
Oh, lady.

758
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:26,940
I don't want to cast a spell on you.

759
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:27,940
You want it?

760
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:29,940

761
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:30,940

Girl, you lost it.

763
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:48,940
She's been really good at chewing too.

764
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:49,940
I'm really happy.

765
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:53,940
I fed her some dry food today because she can chew again.

766
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:57,940
Before it was she just didn't have the jaw strength to chew.

767
00:55:57,940 --> 00:56:05,260
But now she does so she can crunch stuff you want another one. Oh, yes, you do

768
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:07,900
Yes, you do mom was

769
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:12,780
I'll give you one more. Oh, I just dropped it

770
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:23,960
Here the cats are like wait, where's the rest of the tree?

771
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:30,940
Yeah

772
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:35,940
Good girl

773
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:45,020
Yeah, she munchin she be munchin now I was trying to give her her liquid food after I gave her some cable, but she was

774
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:48,900
She was already full from the cable. I was really happy

775
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:51,540
And I gave her some liquid food

776
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:55,460
Because she still needs obviously like water

777
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:59,140
If you're ever feeding an animal

778
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:03,380
And they can't like drink make sure you thicken it with food

779
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:07,540
Because then it'll help their minds differentiate and they won't choke on it as easily

780
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:10,900
I still have stuff

781
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:12,900

Everyone who says lucifer use lucifer as an inheritance kingdom

He must first conjure his demon. He must then serve his demon. He must then walk among the children of men as his demon

1021
01:21:57,860 --> 01:22:00,500
Thus shall you first see the blessing of the unspeakable

1022
01:22:01,700 --> 01:22:04,900
As a family tongue whenever you are in need of rest

1055
01:25:53,620 --> 01:25:57,380
The fact that I can't hold up a crucifix at the same time as walking is crazy

1056
01:25:57,860 --> 01:26:02,020
Just like how I can't walk and drink at the same time. I just am mentally incapable of doing that

1057
01:26:02,020 --> 01:26:04,020
I don't think I'm gonna choke

01:26:09,940 --> 01:26:16,180
God's sees him my mods are asleep. It's fine. Well, it's not but you know what I mean

Hello fuck

1075
01:28:03,620 --> 01:28:05,620

Spooky

1080
01:28:33,380 --> 01:28:34,500
Um

1081
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:40,100
I watched like the behind the scenes of the developer doing the rotoscoping for this and it was actually really cool

1082
01:28:41,300 --> 01:28:42,580
it just

1083
01:28:42,580 --> 01:28:46,180
It just makes it like have this uncanny valley. That's like super creepy

1084
01:28:47,060 --> 01:28:51,220
Because it's like human movements, but in an unusual, you know like medium in format

1085
01:28:52,900 --> 01:28:54,900
Oh

1086
01:29:03,140 --> 01:29:05,140

01:29:09,380 --> 01:29:14,900
More kiss more kiss more like more kiss

1088
01:29:22,260 --> 01:29:27,060
If literally okay, I wish it would save after I grabbed this key

1089
01:29:33,780 --> 01:29:38,420
It's not a boss though. It's just a guy. How am I supposed to kill it?

1090
01:29:41,780 --> 01:29:45,780
Maybe I'll go another place for now. It's just let's just let's just explore

1091
01:29:46,980 --> 01:29:49,860
So I know that dude's down there that'll probably get one of those spirits

1092
01:29:50,820 --> 01:29:52,820
Uh

1093
01:29:56,900 --> 01:30:01,540
All right, that's too bad. It's crazy. I can just walk around it

1094
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:11,140
Dee dee dee dee dee it looks like I have a giant shlong between my legs

1095
01:30:11,940 --> 01:30:13,940
When I walk straight and I just like

1096
01:30:15,300 --> 01:30:17,300
It is dangling, you know

1097
01:30:20,100 --> 01:30:22,100
Time to start a new life in the woods. Just kidding

1098
01:30:26,740 --> 01:30:28,740
Wait, but don't I have a key?

1099
01:30:32,900 --> 01:30:34,900
I swear I have a key though

1100
01:30:40,100 --> 01:30:43,940
This dangles. Yeah, now I bet you can't unsee it because I said that

1101
01:30:45,860 --> 01:30:47,860
Oh, is this the key to it

1102
01:30:50,020 --> 01:30:52,020
No

1103
01:30:53,540 --> 01:30:55,540
Oh, the other you has it. Oh joy

1104
01:30:56,900 --> 01:30:58,900
Time to go fight my other you

1105
01:30:59,700 --> 01:31:01,700
My other me I should say

1106
01:31:05,620 --> 01:31:12,100
It is with great sadness, just a sterling community announces the passing of Cindy martin

1107
01:31:20,020 --> 01:31:26,020
Parents their lives tragically came to an end on September 21st due to an accident in their home

1108
01:31:27,140 --> 01:31:32,180
Bob was a training advisor for the united states navy and Cindy was a cba

1109
01:31:32,900 --> 01:31:39,460
And more recently a stay-at-home mother. They were married march 12 1969 in fallen town

1110
01:31:40,340 --> 01:31:46,180
But not particularly religious. They taught their children to be kind generous and involved in the community

1111
01:31:46,180 --> 01:31:52,340
A public closed casket memorial will be held tilling after you go home and attending on thursday

1112
01:31:52,740 --> 01:31:56,660
Your real service for real services will proceed shortly thereafter

1113
01:31:57,460 --> 01:32:01,460
Bob and Cindy are survived by their daughter Amy and my boys nate and jason

1114
01:32:07,860 --> 01:32:12,340
Like a kid narrating I know I want to add some layer of creepy to it, you know

1115
01:32:16,820 --> 01:32:18,820
I

1116
01:32:20,340 --> 01:32:27,460
Honestly because of this game, I'm not surprised more like similar games haven't come out of people trying to copy the style

1117
01:32:27,620 --> 01:32:29,620
Because it's very cool and unique

1118
01:32:31,700 --> 01:32:33,700
Bye-bye

1119
01:32:36,500 --> 01:32:38,500

1120
01:32:42,420 --> 01:32:44,420

I've cooked poorly, but you know it's still a manageable meal

1130
01:34:09,940 --> 01:34:12,260
Back off I'm not about it

1131
01:34:16,260 --> 01:34:18,260

You're not on gamer subs right now faith does have hands

1165
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:44,260
It's mostly because I just still don't understand the mechanics. I need to shmove

1166
01:37:44,980 --> 01:37:46,980
I like the way you move

Gyrates in the trees

01:38:25,700 --> 01:38:29,780

1177
01:38:45,140 --> 01:38:50,740
Hop the fence with your magnum schlong. No, probably we get stuck like that one, uh, olympics

1178
01:38:51,540 --> 01:38:56,020
Guy that hit his boba to boopy on the high bar

1179
01:39:00,500 --> 01:39:04,820
I need to sit up with my chair my chair is like all the way back

1180
01:39:08,420 --> 01:39:10,420
Oh, that's better. Okay now i'm locked in

1181
01:39:10,420 --> 01:39:21,460
I wish you could skip the cutscenes after a little bit

1182
01:39:33,060 --> 01:39:35,060
Oh

1183
01:39:36,420 --> 01:39:38,420
Make some distance

1184
01:39:40,980 --> 01:39:42,980
I'm stuck

1185
01:39:44,340 --> 01:39:48,980
Wait he just swooped up guys, uh

1186
01:39:57,780 --> 01:40:01,300
This is gonna be a long chapter two kermit

1187
01:40:01,460 --> 01:40:12,020
Yeah, I was a very swoopy wave it was swoopier than the other wave

1188
01:40:14,260 --> 01:40:16,260
I guess maybe the wave gets bigger

1189
01:40:19,220 --> 01:40:21,220
I will handle

1190
01:40:22,660 --> 01:40:27,220
So yeah, he gets he comes out of straight then he comes at us in a little wave

1191
01:40:31,700 --> 01:40:37,780
And he comes at us in a little thing and he comes at us in a bigger wave

1192
01:40:41,060 --> 01:40:43,060
Yeah, I get fucked

1193
01:40:49,140 --> 01:40:51,780
All right, I don't know why that was so difficult for me to do

1194
01:41:02,260 --> 01:41:06,740
Nobody was thrilled when I got pregnant not even a little happy

1195
01:41:08,020 --> 01:41:10,180
And my doctor seemed to be judging me

1196
01:41:11,300 --> 01:41:15,460
Every time I'd leave the doctor's office. I'd see this strange woman across the street

1197
01:41:16,740 --> 01:41:19,220
All she do is stare at me and smile

1198
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:24,100
No words just a big warm smile

1199
01:41:27,460 --> 01:41:30,740
Somehow it made those visits a little more bearable

1200
01:41:31,780 --> 01:41:37,460
After I lost the baby I saw her again across the street from the doctors

1201
01:41:38,100 --> 01:41:40,100
Her smile was as big as ever

1202
01:41:40,820 --> 01:41:45,060
But somehow not as warm and friendly as I remember

1203
01:41:46,580 --> 01:41:50,660
Yesterday I was walking was shocked to see the woman standing in the middle of a path

1204
01:41:51,620 --> 01:41:54,820
Now she was pregnant. She beckoned towards me

1205
01:41:56,020 --> 01:41:58,500
I followed her off the path into the woods

1206
01:41:59,460 --> 01:42:01,460
That's what I meant Gary

1207
01:42:10,420 --> 01:42:12,420
First try gg easy

1208
01:42:18,660 --> 01:42:21,940
I killed that woman's baby. No, I did I did no such thing

1209
01:42:23,460 --> 01:42:27,060
Oh, I can't do that. So let's just go fight this dude. Can I save?

1210
01:42:29,460 --> 01:42:34,340
Hey B, aha nifty

1211
01:42:40,020 --> 01:42:43,380
La-la-la-la-la-la-la. Oh

1212
01:42:47,060 --> 01:42:53,700
Now I know it's right up left up

1213
01:42:55,220 --> 01:42:57,220
Let's fight this guy first though

1214
01:42:58,500 --> 01:43:27,100
Okay, MC screaming baby.

1215
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:42,100
This and grandpa was one of the hardest things I've ever experienced.

1216
01:43:42,100 --> 01:43:44,100
We were really close.

1217
01:43:44,100 --> 01:43:46,100
I cried about it for weeks.

1218
01:43:46,100 --> 01:43:49,100
Then my stepmom introduced me to some of her friends.

1219
01:43:49,100 --> 01:43:50,100
They asked me,

1220
01:43:50,100 --> 01:43:53,100
Would you like to see your grandfather again?

1221
01:43:53,100 --> 01:43:55,100
I missed him so much.

1222
01:43:55,100 --> 01:43:57,100
I was willing to try anything.

1223
01:43:57,100 --> 01:44:00,100
That night my stepmom drove me to one of her friend's house.

1224
01:44:00,100 --> 01:44:02,100
They took me down to the basement.

1225
01:44:02,100 --> 01:44:05,100
I saw my grandfather in there.

1226
01:44:05,100 --> 01:44:08,100
Only, it wasn't actually him.

1227
01:44:08,100 --> 01:44:12,100
When I tried to run, they closed the basement door and locked me in.

1228
01:44:12,100 --> 01:44:15,100
I can't remember much else from that night.

1229
01:44:15,100 --> 01:44:18,100
My stepmom's friends are always coming by the house now.

1230
01:44:18,100 --> 01:44:21,100
They tell me I have a debt to pay.

1231
01:44:21,100 --> 01:44:24,100
They say they have work for me to do.

1232
01:44:25,100 --> 01:44:32,100
It's again a narrator.

1233
01:44:32,100 --> 01:44:35,100
Hype. Hype for making streams.

1234
01:44:35,100 --> 01:44:37,100
Oh, their heads are gone.

1235
01:44:37,100 --> 01:44:40,100
That's lovely.

1236
01:44:40,100 --> 01:44:46,100
Right, up, left, up.

1237
01:44:46,100 --> 01:44:53,100
Right.

1238
01:44:53,100 --> 01:44:55,100
Up.

1239
01:44:55,100 --> 01:44:59,100
I was right, they didn't do it on accident.

1240
01:44:59,100 --> 01:45:03,100
Left.

1241
01:45:03,100 --> 01:45:07,100
I bet people have accidentally brute-forced this without meeting two.

1242
01:45:07,100 --> 01:45:13,100
Up.

1243
01:45:13,100 --> 01:45:26,100
Up.

1244
01:45:26,100 --> 01:45:34,100
Cool.

1245
01:45:34,100 --> 01:45:36,100
I've been freed.

1246
01:45:36,100 --> 01:45:39,100
No overbearing father turned violent alcoholic.

1247
01:45:39,100 --> 01:45:41,100
No more hiding my bruises and cuts.

1248
01:45:41,100 --> 01:45:43,100
No more pills and needles.

1249
01:45:43,100 --> 01:45:46,100
No more getting laughed at and kicked around.

1250
01:45:46,100 --> 01:45:49,100
They'll never laugh at me again.

1251
01:45:49,100 --> 01:45:51,100
By day, my body withers away.

1252
01:45:51,100 --> 01:45:57,100
But by night, my mind explores forbidden worlds of power and knowledge,

1253
01:45:57,100 --> 01:45:59,100
guided by beings of pure darkness.

1254
01:45:59,100 --> 01:46:03,100
I have been trusted with the secret knowledge of the demon seal.

1255
01:46:03,100 --> 01:46:06,100
I have learned the correct conjuring sign,

1256
01:46:06,100 --> 01:46:09,100
drawing the inverted star along the rocks arranged in five.

1257
01:46:09,100 --> 01:46:12,100
First at the top left point, then down.

1258
01:46:12,100 --> 01:46:14,100
I'll lure them into woods.

1259
01:46:14,100 --> 01:46:26,100
Then I will show them my power.

1260
01:46:26,100 --> 01:46:30,100
Did you know if you do the five-pointed star in reverse, it is banishment?

1261
01:46:30,100 --> 01:46:35,100
And it's actually protective?

1262
01:46:35,100 --> 01:46:41,100
The pentagram is not inherently a demonic thing.

1263
01:46:41,100 --> 01:46:42,100
Alrighty.

1264
01:46:42,100 --> 01:46:44,100
I feel like I'm missing something.

1265
01:46:44,100 --> 01:46:50,100
La la la la.

1266
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:52,100
Hey, what's up?

1267
01:46:52,100 --> 01:46:55,100
Can I have it?

1268
01:46:55,100 --> 01:47:00,100
Oh.

1269
01:47:00,100 --> 01:47:03,100
Ow?

1270
01:47:03,100 --> 01:47:05,100
Thanks.

1271
01:47:05,100 --> 01:47:07,100
Now I'm just bleeding from my eye.

1272
01:47:07,100 --> 01:47:19,100
I'm bleeding from my magnum dong.

1273
01:47:19,100 --> 01:47:26,100
Oh, I thought it was going to have me make a five-pointed star.

1274
01:47:26,100 --> 01:47:36,100
Yeah, the inverted cross is also, yeah.

1275
01:47:36,100 --> 01:47:38,100
The magnum dong.

1276
01:47:38,100 --> 01:47:41,100
At least I'm not bleeding.

1277
01:47:41,100 --> 01:47:46,100
I wonder if I, like, actually got stabbed in the eye.

1278
01:47:46,100 --> 01:47:47,100
I feel like I should be.

1279
01:47:47,100 --> 01:47:51,100
Yup.

1280
01:47:51,100 --> 01:47:55,100
Yup.

1281
01:47:55,100 --> 01:48:03,100
There's all these X marks of spots around.

1282
01:48:03,100 --> 01:48:06,100
It killed me?

1283
01:48:06,100 --> 01:48:10,100
Uh, that tree just made like a leaf.

1284
01:48:10,100 --> 01:48:12,100
And leafed.

1285
01:48:12,100 --> 01:48:17,100
That's all I'm going to say.

1286
01:48:17,100 --> 01:48:18,100
Today's my birthday.

1287
01:48:18,100 --> 01:48:20,100
A very happy, open Pokemon card.

1288
01:48:20,100 --> 01:48:21,100
What?

1289
01:48:21,100 --> 01:48:24,100
You pulled a rare $400 shiny Charizard?

1290
01:48:24,100 --> 01:48:25,100
What?

1291
01:48:25,100 --> 01:48:27,100
Happy birthday and congrats.

1292
01:48:27,100 --> 01:48:29,100
Oh my God, that's awesome.

1293
01:48:29,100 --> 01:48:36,100
Alright, which freaking tree is this?

1294
01:48:36,100 --> 01:48:38,100
Where are you?

1295
01:48:38,100 --> 01:48:40,100
Show yourself.

1296
01:48:40,100 --> 01:48:42,100
Do it.

1297
01:48:42,100 --> 01:48:47,100
No?

1298
01:48:47,100 --> 01:48:52,100
Alright.

1299
01:48:52,100 --> 01:48:54,100
It's a great birthday gift.

1300
01:48:54,100 --> 01:49:01,100
Oh, where's purple guy going?

1301
01:49:01,100 --> 01:49:17,100
I can't, sometimes I just can't walk past things.

1302
01:49:17,100 --> 01:49:19,100
Why is this house so big?

1303
01:49:19,100 --> 01:49:22,100
Why can't I walk past the roof?

1304
01:49:22,100 --> 01:49:23,100
What?

1305
01:49:23,100 --> 01:49:26,100
I don't like cornfields like that.

1306
01:49:26,100 --> 01:49:27,100
Oh.

1307
01:49:27,100 --> 01:49:30,100
Nifty.

1308
01:49:30,100 --> 01:49:35,100
Nifty.

1309
01:49:35,100 --> 01:49:37,100
I had to come back.

1310
01:49:37,100 --> 01:49:41,100
I had to walk through the corn one last time.

1311
01:49:41,100 --> 01:49:44,100
I wasn't sure what I would find.

1312
01:49:44,100 --> 01:49:46,100
The dogs.

1313
01:49:46,100 --> 01:49:48,100
The children.

1314
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:51,100
Nothing I'd talk about.

1315
01:49:51,100 --> 01:49:54,100
It had been five years.

1316
01:49:54,100 --> 01:49:57,100
I couldn't even find the little graves anymore.

1317
01:49:57,100 --> 01:50:03,100
I just walked in the field until I found that stupid grinning scarecrow.

1318
01:50:03,100 --> 01:50:10,100
As I listened to the night wind blowing through the crops, it was like the scarecrow was mocking me.

1319
01:50:10,100 --> 01:50:14,100
I turned around to go back and that's when I heard it behind me.

1320
01:50:14,100 --> 01:50:20,100
Well, it was more like I felt it.

1321
01:50:20,100 --> 01:50:24,100
That scared me in the noise of the background.

1322
01:50:24,100 --> 01:50:26,100
I didn't dare turn around.

1323
01:50:26,100 --> 01:50:28,100
It just stood there.

1324
01:50:28,100 --> 01:50:29,100
Me.

1325
01:50:29,100 --> 01:50:31,100
The scarecrow.

1326
01:50:31,100 --> 01:50:34,100
And the doomed child.

1327
01:50:34,100 --> 01:50:38,100
Finally, I mustered up a tiny bit of courage and turned the look.

1328
01:50:38,100 --> 01:50:43,100
It immediately fled in the opposite direction, crashing through the rows of corn.

1329
01:50:43,100 --> 01:50:50,100
I ran to the little I saw that drained the blood from my face and made my skin crawl.

1330
01:50:50,100 --> 01:50:55,100
I say it because whatever it was looking at it didn't have a face.

1331
01:50:55,100 --> 01:51:03,100
Just a bloody gaping hole.

1332
01:51:03,100 --> 01:51:09,100
Alright.

1333
01:51:09,100 --> 01:51:11,100
Hello, child.

1334
01:51:11,100 --> 01:51:13,100
Any child in this corn?

1335
01:51:13,100 --> 01:51:19,100
Children of the corn? Anyone?

1336
01:51:19,100 --> 01:51:21,100
Will I help you?

1337
01:51:21,100 --> 01:51:26,100
I'm trying.

1338
01:51:26,100 --> 01:51:29,100
Hey, look at this guy again.

1339
01:51:29,100 --> 01:51:33,100
Will you help me?

1340
01:51:33,100 --> 01:51:39,100
The way we stack in y'all ended up like children of the corn.

1341
01:51:39,100 --> 01:51:47,100
Interesting.

1342
01:51:47,100 --> 01:51:54,100
Okay, I think I just go back to the house.

1343
01:51:54,100 --> 01:51:56,100
It's William Sheepie.

1344
01:51:56,100 --> 01:52:00,100
Purple guy, William Afton.

1345
01:52:00,100 --> 01:52:07,100
It's William Cottonbomb.

1346
01:52:07,100 --> 01:52:08,100
Oh, okay.

1347
01:52:08,100 --> 01:52:11,100
Gotcha, gotcha.

1348
01:52:11,100 --> 01:52:12,100
Actually, hold on.

1349
01:52:12,100 --> 01:52:14,100
Before I go into the house, I just kind of want to look around.

1350
01:52:14,100 --> 01:52:16,100
Can I go over here?

1351
01:52:17,100 --> 01:52:22,100
Oh, cursed rock.

1352
01:52:22,100 --> 01:52:25,100
What about on this side?

1353
01:52:25,100 --> 01:52:28,100
Please, for the love of God, can I just run?

1354
01:52:28,100 --> 01:52:35,100
I'm moving like molasses.

1355
01:52:35,100 --> 01:52:36,100
More rocks?

1356
01:52:36,100 --> 01:52:37,100
Don't mind if I do.

1357
01:52:37,100 --> 01:52:41,100
Let me take a bite of these delicious rocks.

1358
01:52:41,100 --> 01:52:44,100
Let me take a seat on these delicious rock.

1359
01:52:44,100 --> 01:52:48,100
Oh, that makes sense.

1360
01:52:48,100 --> 01:52:51,100
Will you help me?

1361
01:52:51,100 --> 01:52:53,100
Confess license.

1362
01:52:53,100 --> 01:52:55,100
I'm a whore, your honor.

1363
01:52:55,100 --> 01:53:02,100
All right.

1364
01:53:02,100 --> 01:53:06,100
Day one of our paranormal investigation to the Old Snake Meadow Hill Church.

1365
01:53:06,100 --> 01:53:12,100
We've got three cameras, a box of tapes, and just enough beer and beef jerky to last us a week.

1366
01:53:12,100 --> 01:53:17,100
It's a lot of beef jerky on our way, and we asked some of the locals of the church.

1367
01:53:17,100 --> 01:53:20,100
It was mostly the stories we'd heard before.

1368
01:53:20,100 --> 01:53:25,100
Evil spirits dragging children to the color field and secret tunnels under the chapel.

1369
01:53:25,100 --> 01:53:29,100
But there was this spindly lady game that we hadn't heard yet.

1370
01:53:29,100 --> 01:53:35,100
Apparently, it has to do with summoning the spirit of a woman who used to take care of the orphans back in the 50s.

1371
01:53:35,100 --> 01:53:38,100
There was even an old rhyme they told us.

1372
01:53:38,100 --> 01:53:43,100
Walk the church from room to room, and maybe he will see her.

1373
01:53:43,100 --> 01:53:47,100
She will move when you do, but never try to trick her.

1374
01:53:47,100 --> 01:53:48,100
Awesome.

1375
01:53:48,100 --> 01:54:00,100
We're going to try the game tonight as soon as we get settled in.

1376
01:54:00,100 --> 01:54:05,100
Interesting, but never try to trick her.

1377
01:54:05,100 --> 01:54:13,100
I'm wondering if these represent the rooms?

1378
01:54:13,100 --> 01:54:19,100
Confessed to be be last week.

1379
01:54:19,100 --> 01:54:23,100
Yeah, because now, see, this is the candles representing of what room I'm in.

1380
01:54:23,100 --> 01:54:27,100
I'm assuming she's in the last room.

1381
01:54:27,100 --> 01:54:31,100
At least that's what I think.

1382
01:54:31,100 --> 01:54:35,100
Sick purple skull, bro.

1383
01:54:35,100 --> 01:54:38,100
There's a lot of crosses in here.

1384
01:54:38,100 --> 01:54:39,100
Beautiful confessional.

1385
01:54:39,100 --> 01:54:42,100
Honestly, the pixel art is so good in this game.

1386
01:54:42,100 --> 01:54:50,100
I know it's super simple, but it's not at the same time.

1387
01:54:50,100 --> 01:54:55,100
All right, I guess I'll go in here.

1388
01:54:55,100 --> 01:54:58,100
Pray for me, father, for I have sinned.

1389
01:54:58,100 --> 01:55:01,100
You have sinned, you have sinned, you have sinned, you have sinned.

1390
01:55:01,100 --> 01:55:04,100
I tried to save a girl from evil.

1391
01:55:04,100 --> 01:55:07,100
But my dear soldier gave me.

1392
01:55:07,100 --> 01:55:10,100
I turned my mechanism in history.

1393
01:55:10,100 --> 01:55:12,100
And broke my house to God.

1394
01:55:12,100 --> 01:55:13,100
Oh man.

1395
01:55:13,100 --> 01:55:17,100
A year later, the girl reached out to me again.

1396
01:55:17,100 --> 01:55:19,100
She reached out.

1397
01:55:19,100 --> 01:55:22,100
Oh wait, that was when I went back.

1398
01:55:22,100 --> 01:55:25,100
I am sorry for me that my best sins.

1399
01:55:25,100 --> 01:55:29,100
Now his sin will kill you life in it.

1400
01:55:29,100 --> 01:55:34,100
Bring the child to me before we see them together.

1401
01:55:34,100 --> 01:55:36,100
Why would I just go?

1402
01:55:36,100 --> 01:55:38,100
He will kill you the peace now, see this.

1403
01:55:38,100 --> 01:55:41,100
He vicks to know it for you good.

1404
01:55:41,100 --> 01:55:45,100
For his mercy and yours forever.

1405
01:55:45,100 --> 01:55:52,100
Why would I want to listen to the random demon in the confessional?

1406
01:55:52,100 --> 01:55:55,100
Oh, see now I've moved to the next room.

1407
01:55:55,100 --> 01:56:00,100
All right, and she must be in two rooms over.

1408
01:56:00,100 --> 01:56:06,100
I love like one of my favorite sculptures is our mother of sorrows.

1409
01:56:06,100 --> 01:56:10,100
I can't remember.

1410
01:56:10,100 --> 01:56:16,100
Just a really gorgeous, beautiful statue of Mother Mary.

1411
01:56:16,100 --> 01:56:22,100
Or at least to some other saint, female saint.

1412
01:56:22,100 --> 01:56:24,100
All right, can I?

1413
01:56:24,100 --> 01:56:25,100
No.

1414
01:56:25,100 --> 01:56:26,100
Hi, Tomah!

1415
01:56:26,100 --> 01:56:35,100
Yeah, this is where mortis is from.

1416
01:56:35,100 --> 01:56:39,100
Okay.

1417
01:56:39,100 --> 01:56:46,100
So then if I go, there must be a way for me to go into the center middle room.

1418
01:56:46,100 --> 01:56:47,100
I just don't know how.

1419
01:56:47,100 --> 01:56:48,100
Is that to do with her?

1420
01:56:48,100 --> 01:56:56,100
Oh.

1421
01:56:56,100 --> 01:56:58,100
We still have a fight.

1422
01:56:58,100 --> 01:57:01,100
We still have a fight our way into the basement.

1423
01:57:01,100 --> 01:57:03,100
But we found something just as cool.

1424
01:57:03,100 --> 01:57:07,100
A secret passage in the Old Confession, both leading to this hallway.

1425
01:57:07,100 --> 01:57:09,100
Henry's going to town to fire a crowbar.

1426
01:57:09,100 --> 01:57:12,100
We'll see if we can't get these boards off some of these doors.

1427
01:57:12,100 --> 01:57:14,100
That's not even the best part.

1428
01:57:14,100 --> 01:57:16,100
We caught an EVP.

1429
01:57:16,100 --> 01:57:20,100
Can't hear it on tape very well, but to us it's a kind of Saturday night laughing.

1430
01:57:20,100 --> 01:57:22,100
Thank God we brought the nice mic.

1431
01:57:22,100 --> 01:57:27,100
We'll review it on the sound gear once we get back into town.

1432
01:57:27,100 --> 01:57:34,100
I wonder why it's bloody.

1433
01:57:34,100 --> 01:57:38,100
There must be a crowbar somewhere then.

1434
01:57:38,100 --> 01:57:43,100
Hmm.

1435
01:57:43,100 --> 01:57:56,100
Where's night two?

1436
01:57:56,100 --> 01:58:01,100
Night two.

1437
01:58:01,100 --> 01:58:05,100
Alright, so I'm in the center, so I guess maybe I can go straight up.

1438
01:58:05,100 --> 01:58:10,100
She is in the top room.

1439
01:58:10,100 --> 01:58:19,100
Okay, no, she's in the, she moves again.

1440
01:58:19,100 --> 01:58:21,100
Nice voice acting, thank you.

1441
01:58:21,100 --> 01:58:33,100
I saw something move when I walked in there.

1442
01:58:33,100 --> 01:58:36,100
Let's see if I can make it happen again.

1443
01:58:36,100 --> 01:58:37,100
Oh, where is she?

1444
01:58:37,100 --> 01:58:46,100
The flames out.

1445
01:58:46,100 --> 01:58:48,100
I mean she's in the room with me, isn't she?

1446
01:58:48,100 --> 01:59:00,100
I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go.

1447
01:59:00,100 --> 01:59:06,100
Alright.

1448
01:59:06,100 --> 01:59:10,100
Wait, where am I?

1449
01:59:10,100 --> 01:59:16,100
I can't tell which one I am.

1450
01:59:16,100 --> 01:59:20,100
Oh, here's night two.

1451
01:59:20,100 --> 01:59:21,100
Should flash everything?

1452
01:59:21,100 --> 01:59:23,100
Yeah, I should.

1453
01:59:23,100 --> 01:59:24,100
We're gonna be rich.

1454
01:59:24,100 --> 01:59:27,100
We've caught the supernatural stuff on camera before, sure.

1455
01:59:27,100 --> 01:59:31,100
Doors opening on their own, things falling off the shelves, nothing like this.

1456
01:59:31,100 --> 01:59:34,100
Tonight we'll be trying this spindly lady game again.

1457
01:59:34,100 --> 01:59:38,100
One of the candles on the floor lit up by itself as soon as Lars walked into the room.

1458
01:59:38,100 --> 01:59:40,100
No, it was nuts and we got it all on film.

1459
01:59:40,100 --> 01:59:44,100
We're gonna make a fortune selling this to Stevie's stations.

1460
01:59:44,100 --> 01:59:47,100
Alright.

1461
01:59:47,100 --> 01:59:49,100
Yeah, she's in the top room.

1462
01:59:49,100 --> 01:59:50,100
Okay, so I was right.

1463
01:59:50,100 --> 01:59:57,100
So that does represent her moving around.

1464
01:59:57,100 --> 01:59:59,100
Aren't I wicked smart?

1465
01:59:59,100 --> 02:00:02,100
Let me see.

1466
02:00:02,100 --> 02:00:04,100
Very beautiful mosaics.

1467
02:00:04,100 --> 02:00:07,100
Cool.

1468
02:00:07,100 --> 02:00:12,100
Oh, interesting.

1469
02:00:12,100 --> 02:00:14,100
Fascinating, fascinating.

1470
02:00:14,100 --> 02:00:17,100
I can't tell if it's a broken candle on the ground.

1471
02:00:17,100 --> 02:00:19,100
Oh no, she's in the same room.

1472
02:00:19,100 --> 02:00:28,100
Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go, gotta go, gotta go, gotta go, gotta go, gotta go.

1473
02:00:28,100 --> 02:00:32,100
Okay, this is another part of the chapel.

1474
02:00:32,100 --> 02:00:33,100
Watch the candles.

1475
02:00:33,100 --> 02:00:41,100
Yeah, no duh, I've been watching the candles.

1476
02:00:41,100 --> 02:00:50,100
Okay, I think I need to spam more stuff.

1477
02:00:50,100 --> 02:00:53,100
I'm surprised I haven't found the crowbar yet.

1478
02:00:53,100 --> 02:01:02,100
It's a really pretty cross.

1479
02:01:02,100 --> 02:01:08,100
Alright, she is far away.

1480
02:01:09,100 --> 02:01:11,100
Well, she's getting closer to me.

1481
02:01:11,100 --> 02:01:13,100
Why is there?

1482
02:01:13,100 --> 02:01:19,100
It seems like something's under this rug because it keeps twitching.

1483
02:01:19,100 --> 02:01:22,100
I need you to move.

1484
02:01:22,100 --> 02:01:28,100
Why does it do that?

1485
02:01:28,100 --> 02:01:30,100
Okay, that's the basement.

1486
02:01:30,100 --> 02:01:32,100
There's stairs, that's what it is.

1487
02:01:32,100 --> 02:01:40,100
Where do I get down there?

1488
02:01:40,100 --> 02:01:46,100
Okay, she's behind me.

1489
02:01:46,100 --> 02:01:51,100
It's giving me a hint.

1490
02:01:51,100 --> 02:01:57,100
Huh, that when I walk into a room something opens.

1491
02:01:57,100 --> 02:01:59,100
Okay, we switch places.

1492
02:01:59,100 --> 02:02:04,100
I'm gonna go, hold on actually.

1493
02:02:04,100 --> 02:02:08,100
I didn't check these out yet.

1494
02:02:08,100 --> 02:02:11,100
This is cool, this is spooky, I'm feeling spooked.

1495
02:02:11,100 --> 02:02:13,100
Maybe through the confession book?

1496
02:02:13,100 --> 02:02:16,100
Yeah, I'm thinking about going through the confessional again.

1497
02:02:16,100 --> 02:02:18,100
Cause there's a little hallway on the other side.

1498
02:02:18,100 --> 02:02:20,100
Is there like another one?

1499
02:02:20,100 --> 02:02:28,100
Okay, well.

1500
02:02:28,100 --> 02:02:31,100
Cause this one's covered in blood.

1501
02:02:31,100 --> 02:02:37,100
I'm just wondering why that is.

1502
02:02:37,100 --> 02:02:41,100
Cause there's gotta be a crowbar somewhere.

1503
02:02:41,100 --> 02:02:46,100
So she's in the center room.

1504
02:02:46,100 --> 02:02:48,100
Cat food dispenser, my beloved.

1505
02:02:48,100 --> 02:02:55,100
Maybe I'm supposed to have her show up in that room.

1506
02:02:55,100 --> 02:03:10,100
Let's try to spam it so she shows up.

1507
02:03:10,100 --> 02:03:15,100
That scared you.

1508
02:03:15,100 --> 02:03:20,100
My beloved.

1509
02:03:20,100 --> 02:03:22,100
Alright.

1510
02:03:22,100 --> 02:03:24,100
Okay, wait, do I have to go get the notes again?

1511
02:03:24,100 --> 02:03:26,100
I just want to make sure.

1512
02:03:26,100 --> 02:03:29,100
Okay, I do, great.

1513
02:03:29,100 --> 02:03:47,100
I wish I would just save that.

1514
02:03:47,100 --> 02:03:50,100
Spindly lady, where you at?

1515
02:03:50,100 --> 02:04:05,100
Come on, show me that cat.

1516
02:04:05,100 --> 02:04:11,100
There's one more big room if I go up.

1517
02:04:11,100 --> 02:04:18,100
What are you talking about?

1518
02:04:18,100 --> 02:04:21,100
I'm in the big room.

1519
02:04:21,100 --> 02:04:23,100
Yeah, I'm down here.

1520
02:04:23,100 --> 02:04:27,100
Now I'm up here.

1521
02:04:27,100 --> 02:04:32,100
Wait, but there must be one to the side.

1522
02:04:32,100 --> 02:04:41,100
But how? How do I get to the one to the top side?

1523
02:04:41,100 --> 02:04:43,100
Show me that fire.

1524
02:04:43,100 --> 02:04:45,100
It's like grimace shake.

1525
02:04:45,100 --> 02:04:48,100
The shakes are pretty good, I won't lie to you.

1526
02:04:48,100 --> 02:04:51,100
What if, is it through here?

1527
02:04:51,100 --> 02:04:55,100
Do I have to break one of the glass?

1528
02:04:55,100 --> 02:04:59,100
Because it's up here to the right.

1529
02:04:59,100 --> 02:05:01,100
Oh, it's the room that's watched the candles.

1530
02:05:01,100 --> 02:05:04,100
Oh, wait, you're right, you're right, you're right.

1531
02:05:04,100 --> 02:05:06,100
You're right.

1532
02:05:06,100 --> 02:05:07,100
It's over here.

1533
02:05:07,100 --> 02:05:14,100
I have to go in that room again anyways.

1534
02:05:15,100 --> 02:05:18,100
Just check in, just check in, you know.

1535
02:05:18,100 --> 02:05:21,100
I always want to check.

1536
02:05:21,100 --> 02:05:23,100
Good night.

1537
02:05:23,100 --> 02:05:25,100
Stop.

1538
02:05:25,100 --> 02:05:46,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1539
02:05:46,100 --> 02:05:52,100
No, no one.

1540
02:05:53,100 --> 02:05:56,100
Wait.

1541
02:05:56,100 --> 02:06:01,100
If we're in the same room.

1542
02:06:01,100 --> 02:06:05,100
We're in the same room, where are you?

1543
02:06:05,100 --> 02:06:14,100
Throw yourself.

1544
02:06:14,100 --> 02:06:16,100
Guys, what's happening?

1545
02:06:16,100 --> 02:06:21,100
What do I do?

1546
02:06:21,100 --> 02:06:27,100
How do I get to the damn basement?

1547
02:06:27,100 --> 02:06:30,100
I need to kill that lady.

1548
02:06:30,100 --> 02:06:32,100
It's giving me a hint.

1549
02:06:32,100 --> 02:06:44,100
Oh, she's up here with me.

1550
02:06:44,100 --> 02:06:46,100
I'm on, I'm at a loss.

1551
02:06:46,100 --> 02:06:55,100
I don't know what to do.

1552
02:06:55,100 --> 02:06:56,100
Cringe.

1553
02:06:56,100 --> 02:06:59,100
You know what, I've taken 30% of this crisp dollar bill.

1554
02:06:59,100 --> 02:07:00,100
You streamlapsed today.

1555
02:07:00,100 --> 02:07:09,100
Thank you, I didn't see that.

1556
02:07:09,100 --> 02:07:19,100
I guess I'll just grab everything again.

1557
02:07:19,100 --> 02:07:26,100
What can I like, is there a way to save?

1558
02:07:26,100 --> 02:07:42,100
Okay, I guess not.

1559
02:07:42,100 --> 02:07:51,100
If I go back between the rooms too fast, it'll kill me.

1560
02:07:51,100 --> 02:07:54,100
I wish I could get that first note again.

1561
02:07:54,100 --> 02:07:57,100
What is this thing randomly on the floor?

1562
02:07:57,100 --> 02:07:58,100
I don't know what that is.

1563
02:07:58,100 --> 02:08:04,100
None of these pictures or anything.

1564
02:08:04,100 --> 02:08:09,100
So do I have to go between to the rooms really fast for her to come get me?

1565
02:08:09,100 --> 02:08:27,100
Do I have to have her come get me?

1566
02:08:27,100 --> 02:08:36,100
If I already collected the notes, do I have to collect them again?

1567
02:08:36,100 --> 02:08:39,100
I just need to meet her along her path.

1568
02:08:39,100 --> 02:08:45,100
Well, if I go down here...

1569
02:08:45,100 --> 02:08:51,100
Okay, well, she's in the next room.

1570
02:08:51,100 --> 02:09:05,100
Oh, and the screen shakes I can kill her, because we're in the same room right now.

1571
02:09:05,100 --> 02:09:12,100
Alright.

1572
02:09:12,100 --> 02:09:22,100
Press escape and check notes.

1573
02:09:22,100 --> 02:09:25,100
Okay, yeah, so it doesn't save the freaking notes that I've already collected.

1574
02:09:25,100 --> 02:09:29,100
That's annoying.

1575
02:09:29,100 --> 02:09:31,100
I don't need the notes.

1576
02:09:31,100 --> 02:09:35,100
I don't, but it said that it said something about notes.

1577
02:09:35,100 --> 02:09:37,100
Isn't this like Sunderman?

1578
02:09:37,100 --> 02:09:43,100
Do I need to collect the notes?

1579
02:09:43,100 --> 02:09:58,100
Alright, I don't focus on that then.

1580
02:09:58,100 --> 02:10:08,100
Why are you in the hallway? Come over here.

1581
02:10:08,100 --> 02:10:14,100
Oh my God, lady.

1582
02:10:14,100 --> 02:10:17,100
It's just the lore? Okay.

1583
02:10:17,100 --> 02:10:19,100
Where are you?

1584
02:10:19,100 --> 02:10:22,100
Come here.

1585
02:10:22,100 --> 02:10:31,100
I don't want to go too fast.

1586
02:10:31,100 --> 02:10:35,100
Come on, lady.

1587
02:10:35,100 --> 02:10:39,100
Oh my God, why are you still in the hallway?

1588
02:10:39,100 --> 02:10:45,100
Okay, she's coming back around, so I should be able to meet her down here.

1589
02:10:45,100 --> 02:10:51,100
I think?

1590
02:10:51,100 --> 02:10:55,100
What are you doing? Get out of there.

1591
02:10:55,100 --> 02:10:58,100
Get out of the hallway.

1592
02:10:58,100 --> 02:11:05,100
I kind of don't want to fight you in the hallway. It's like the worst place for us to fight.

1593
02:11:05,100 --> 02:11:12,100
I don't like that that keeps popping open.

1594
02:11:12,100 --> 02:11:18,100
Lady, I swear to God, if you don't let me kill you.

1595
02:11:18,100 --> 02:11:25,100
Finally.

1596
02:11:25,100 --> 02:11:47,100
I'm ready.

1597
02:11:47,100 --> 02:11:55,100
Oh.

1598
02:11:55,100 --> 02:12:00,100
It's hard to hit it.

1599
02:12:00,100 --> 02:12:06,100
Oh.

1600
02:12:06,100 --> 02:12:12,100
Please.

1601
02:12:12,100 --> 02:12:23,100
God, please.

1602
02:12:23,100 --> 02:12:36,100
Got her a little bit. Got the tail end.

1603
02:12:36,100 --> 02:12:44,100
Oh, please.

1604
02:12:44,100 --> 02:12:48,100
Fuck.

1605
02:12:48,100 --> 02:12:51,100
Damn it.

1606
02:12:51,100 --> 02:12:54,100
The endurance fight.

1607
02:12:54,100 --> 02:12:57,100
Getting a sauce on my spindly lady.

1608
02:12:57,100 --> 02:13:12,100
You know what the creepiest thing I remember being freaked out about was the bent neck lady from Haunting a Hill House.

1609
02:13:12,100 --> 02:13:15,100
That scared the crap out of me.

1610
02:13:15,100 --> 02:13:18,100
And the old man with the bowler hat.

1611
02:13:18,100 --> 02:13:24,100
Actually, I prefer to fight her in the other room besides this one's kind of a hard room to fight in.

1612
02:13:24,100 --> 02:13:28,100
Like over here.

1613
02:13:28,100 --> 02:13:32,100
And I come back down maybe.

1614
02:13:32,100 --> 02:13:38,100
I love Haunting a Hill House. I watched it like three times the entire series.

1615
02:13:38,100 --> 02:13:40,100
Yeah.

1616
02:13:40,100 --> 02:13:46,100
Watch the candles. Oh, no. Watch them.

1617
02:13:46,100 --> 02:13:56,100
I think my crosses is better than all these crosses.

1618
02:13:56,100 --> 02:14:02,100
Why is she all the way up there?

1619
02:14:02,100 --> 02:14:05,100
Ma'am.

1620
02:14:05,100 --> 02:14:11,100
Oh, my God.

1621
02:14:11,100 --> 02:14:17,100
I know she's like following my path probably, but like, it's annoying.

1622
02:14:17,100 --> 02:14:24,100
Oh, here we go. Fine, I'll just fight her again in here.

1623
02:14:24,100 --> 02:14:28,100
Any moment now.

1624
02:14:28,100 --> 02:14:33,100
Any moment now.

1625
02:14:33,100 --> 02:14:39,100
Ma'am.

1626
02:14:39,100 --> 02:14:45,100
Yeah, I love Flanagan stuff. My Flanagan is awesome.

1627
02:14:45,100 --> 02:14:49,100
Are you serious?

1628
02:14:49,100 --> 02:14:51,100
Come on then.

1629
02:14:51,100 --> 02:14:58,100
You're fucking nonce. Let me fucking... Jesus Christ.

1630
02:14:58,100 --> 02:15:03,100
Let me put you out of your fucking misery then.

1631
02:15:03,100 --> 02:15:08,100
Oh, my Lord.

1632
02:15:08,100 --> 02:15:12,100
Just a little shy. Just a little.

1633
02:15:12,100 --> 02:15:20,100
Alright. Okay, I don't know why I couldn't...

1634
02:15:20,100 --> 02:15:23,100
I'm gonna...

1635
02:15:23,100 --> 02:15:27,100
Alright.

1636
02:15:27,100 --> 02:15:33,100
That was a good one.

1637
02:15:33,100 --> 02:15:38,100
Yeah.

1638
02:15:38,100 --> 02:15:43,100
Yeah.

1639
02:15:43,100 --> 02:15:49,100
Nope. Oh, I still got it.

1640
02:15:49,100 --> 02:15:54,100
Die. Dammit.

1641
02:15:54,100 --> 02:16:02,100
Frick. She gets like too fast sometimes.

1642
02:16:02,100 --> 02:16:15,100
It's good when she's like far away.

1643
02:16:15,100 --> 02:16:23,100
Oh, she was too close for me to step out the way.

1644
02:16:23,100 --> 02:16:26,100
Rip.

1645
02:16:26,100 --> 02:16:33,100
Alright, let's go try to tease her again.

1646
02:16:33,100 --> 02:16:40,100
I really want a Pop-Tart. I know why.

1647
02:16:40,100 --> 02:16:45,100
The smell of a Pop-Tart just wafted into my head for some reason.

1648
02:16:45,100 --> 02:16:55,100
The thing is, she doesn't show up right now. I don't understand why it glitches like that.

1649
02:16:55,100 --> 02:17:02,100
Frickin' come out! I swear to God, lady.

1650
02:17:02,100 --> 02:17:14,100
Oh, my God.

1651
02:17:14,100 --> 02:17:20,100
You were taking too long to show up so I had to spam it.

1652
02:17:20,100 --> 02:17:25,100
Like a true FPS player.

1653
02:17:25,100 --> 02:17:32,100
She's taken too long to show up.

1654
02:17:32,100 --> 02:17:39,100
Morty's Morty.

1655
02:17:39,100 --> 02:17:44,100
Come on, I'll fight you up here.

1656
02:17:44,100 --> 02:17:47,100
What, you moved down?

1657
02:17:47,100 --> 02:17:53,100
Oh, my God, lady.

1658
02:17:53,100 --> 02:17:59,100
Where are you going?

1659
02:17:59,100 --> 02:18:09,100
Where did you come from? Where did you go? Where did you come from? Cotton-eyed Joe.

1660
02:18:09,100 --> 02:18:20,100
Oh, great. Now I'm going to fight you in this really tiny ass room.

1661
02:18:20,100 --> 02:18:24,100
Oh, was I supposed to put up my cross when that happens?

1662
02:18:24,100 --> 02:18:30,100
Boomi, did you just get scared by my foot?

1663
02:18:30,100 --> 02:18:37,100
Boomi, what are you doing?

1664
02:18:37,100 --> 02:18:41,100
Frick.

1665
02:18:41,100 --> 02:18:45,100
Why aren't you showing up yet?

1666
02:18:45,100 --> 02:18:48,100
Is this the room you just don't want to fight in?

1667
02:18:48,100 --> 02:18:51,100
Oh, okay.

1668
02:18:51,100 --> 02:19:04,100
Geez. Oh, I didn't turn around the way.

1669
02:19:04,100 --> 02:19:09,100
What?

1670
02:19:09,100 --> 02:19:16,100
Okay.

1671
02:19:16,100 --> 02:19:19,100
No.

1672
02:19:19,100 --> 02:19:22,100
Not the narrow hallway fight.

1673
02:19:22,100 --> 02:19:28,100
Yeah, I can't really move around.

1674
02:19:28,100 --> 02:19:30,100
Morty, that's what I'm saying.

1675
02:19:30,100 --> 02:19:35,100
Oh, we're back. She's here, though.

1676
02:19:35,100 --> 02:19:41,100
Oh, spindly lady. Let me spindle your lady.

1677
02:19:41,100 --> 02:19:53,100
Where are you hiding, miss spindly lady?

1678
02:19:53,100 --> 02:19:58,100
Oh, spindly lady, show us your wisdom.

1679
02:19:58,100 --> 02:20:08,100
I'm going to start breakdancing with my magnum dong.

1680
02:20:08,100 --> 02:20:11,100
Please.

1681
02:20:11,100 --> 02:20:20,100
Show yourself. You know what? I'm picking a different room to fight in, then, because you're taking too long.

1682
02:20:20,100 --> 02:20:27,100
All right, we're in the same room.

1683
02:20:27,100 --> 02:20:34,100
Show yourself.

1684
02:20:34,100 --> 02:20:39,100
I'm going to get a fucking seizure.

1685
02:20:39,100 --> 02:20:44,100
I'm literally just unfocusing my eyes right now on accident.

1686
02:20:44,100 --> 02:20:49,100
She hates me.

1687
02:20:49,100 --> 02:20:54,100
I don't understand why she doesn't. Is that like a game glitch or am I just stupid?

1688
02:20:54,100 --> 02:20:58,100
Should I be doing something else besides standing in the room that she's in?

1689
02:20:58,100 --> 02:21:00,100
Or do we have to fight in the church?

1690
02:21:00,100 --> 02:21:15,100
Well, no, that's not true, because I just fought over there.

1691
02:21:15,100 --> 02:21:19,100
All right, well, it's not a game glitch.

1692
02:21:19,100 --> 02:21:28,100
Okay, what else should I be doing?

1693
02:21:28,100 --> 02:21:34,100
If I show a little leg.

1694
02:21:34,100 --> 02:21:38,100
I'm showing a little leg.

1695
02:21:38,100 --> 02:21:47,100
You like that?

1696
02:21:47,100 --> 02:21:49,100
Leg, leg.

1697
02:21:49,100 --> 02:21:56,100
I'm her, her, her, her, her, her, her.

1698
02:21:56,100 --> 02:21:59,100
Take a pic, it's me, me, me, me, me.

1699
02:21:59,100 --> 02:22:07,100
Sorry, I've been like, that's been my song I've been listening to on repeat lately is her by Megan Thee Stallion.

1700
02:22:07,100 --> 02:22:16,100
All right, well, she's just following me now.

1701
02:22:16,100 --> 02:22:19,100
Bring on Foul Beast.

1702
02:22:19,100 --> 02:22:23,100
I'm going to sit in this table then.

1703
02:22:23,100 --> 02:22:30,100
Who are we behaving for the most part?

1704
02:22:30,100 --> 02:22:36,100
Between my legs, I'm showing her what's, I'm showing her my third leg and nothing's going on.

1705
02:22:36,100 --> 02:22:39,100
She's not.

1706
02:22:39,100 --> 02:22:46,100
Oh my God, this spindly whore.

1707
02:22:46,100 --> 02:22:50,100
Come out.

1708
02:22:50,100 --> 02:22:56,100
She's trolling me hardcore.

1709
02:22:56,100 --> 02:22:59,100
Oh my gosh, she really jumped to the next room.

1710
02:22:59,100 --> 02:23:08,100
Stop opening that.

1711
02:23:08,100 --> 02:23:12,100
Come here.

1712
02:23:12,100 --> 02:23:17,100
Oh my God.

1713
02:23:17,100 --> 02:23:19,100
Okay, let's do this, let's do this.

1714
02:23:19,100 --> 02:23:35,100
Come on, come on, I'm standing in the center of the room.

1715
02:23:35,100 --> 02:23:39,100
I'm getting juked by a ghost, and then a ghost.

1716
02:23:39,100 --> 02:23:41,100
What the hell?

1717
02:23:41,100 --> 02:23:43,100
No, Bumi.

1718
02:23:43,100 --> 02:23:46,100
Bumi, no.

1719
02:23:46,100 --> 02:23:53,100
Bumi, I can't see.

1720
02:23:53,100 --> 02:23:59,100
Bumi, you can't lay on Fia.

1721
02:23:59,100 --> 02:24:04,100
Bumi, I can't see.

1722
02:24:04,100 --> 02:24:06,100
Bumi, please.

1723
02:24:06,100 --> 02:24:15,100
I can't tell what's happening.

1724
02:24:15,100 --> 02:24:18,100
Bumi!

1725
02:24:18,100 --> 02:24:23,100
I can't even tell where to point.

1726
02:24:23,100 --> 02:24:28,100
Bumi, move your freaking, oh wait, I can't do that.

1727
02:24:28,100 --> 02:24:31,100
I'm going to hold you like a baby for your crimes.

1728
02:24:31,100 --> 02:24:35,100
This is what you deserve, you deserve to be held like a baby.

1729
02:24:35,100 --> 02:24:38,100
Yeah, oh you're so cute.

1730
02:24:38,100 --> 02:24:40,100
Oh, he's a boy.

1731
02:24:40,100 --> 02:24:45,100
Little baby.

1732
02:24:45,100 --> 02:24:47,100
Yeah, he's a baby boy.

1733
02:24:47,100 --> 02:24:51,100
Oh, give me some toes, ooh.

1734
02:24:51,100 --> 02:24:54,100
I need to clip your toenails.

1735
02:24:54,100 --> 02:24:57,100
The pinks on your back toes are pretty long,

1736
02:24:57,100 --> 02:24:59,100
I should be mindful of that.

1737
02:24:59,100 --> 02:25:01,100
Maybe I'll file them instead.

1738
02:25:01,100 --> 02:25:05,100
You got like rabbit feet, bro.

1739
02:25:05,100 --> 02:25:08,100
Your little pretty blue eyes, why are your eyes so blue?

1740
02:25:08,100 --> 02:25:10,100
Usually they're lighter.

1741
02:25:10,100 --> 02:25:13,100
I'll give you a kiss with your little airplane ears.

1742
02:25:13,100 --> 02:25:16,100
Oh, you look like a little baby.

1743
02:25:16,100 --> 02:25:18,100
You're just a little baby.

1744
02:25:18,100 --> 02:25:21,100
Oh no, you can't even, baby.

1745
02:25:21,100 --> 02:25:26,100
All right, you can leave.

1746
02:25:26,100 --> 02:25:34,100
I'm so full from that stuff.

1747
02:25:35,100 --> 02:25:40,100
All right, let's lock in, bros.

1748
02:25:58,100 --> 02:26:01,100
Yeah, I like this room best.

1749
02:26:05,100 --> 02:26:10,100
She's getting faster.

1750
02:26:15,100 --> 02:26:19,100
She's calling me Jake.

1751
02:26:19,100 --> 02:26:22,100
All right, we did it.

1752
02:26:22,100 --> 02:26:26,100
Wait, I want to see what this room looks like.

1753
02:26:26,100 --> 02:26:28,100
No, okay.

1754
02:26:28,100 --> 02:26:31,100
Nothing changed.

1755
02:26:31,100 --> 02:26:34,100
We locked in, boys.

1756
02:26:34,100 --> 02:26:37,100
We got stuck on a pew, but we locked in.

1757
02:26:37,100 --> 02:26:41,100
Yeah, let's go into the scary basement.

1758
02:26:41,100 --> 02:26:44,100
Darkness surrounds thee.

1759
02:27:01,100 --> 02:27:06,100
She's calling full well as she waits for me ahead.

1760
02:27:06,100 --> 02:27:11,100
Checking my old watch has revealed something quite astonishing.

1761
02:27:11,100 --> 02:27:17,100
Time doesn't change down here as we know it on the surface.

1762
02:27:17,100 --> 02:27:24,100
But now, the hands don't move past.

1763
02:27:24,100 --> 02:27:27,100
Who?

1764
02:27:27,100 --> 02:27:30,100
God's work we done.

1765
02:27:30,100 --> 02:27:34,100
I have bent to earth on the faintest light shine.

1766
02:27:34,100 --> 02:27:38,100
Checking for things unspeakable.

1767
02:27:38,100 --> 02:27:43,100
God help me, Father Clark, foolish old man,

1768
02:27:43,100 --> 02:27:46,100
going mad in this dark prison.

1769
02:27:46,100 --> 02:27:51,100
He was bleeding from the screams.

1770
02:27:51,100 --> 02:27:54,100
Oh, the demon.

1771
02:28:00,100 --> 02:28:02,100
This is one of the confusing parts of the game.

1772
02:28:02,100 --> 02:28:04,100
I didn't want to give you any wrong info.

1773
02:28:04,100 --> 02:28:06,100
Oh, okay.

1774
02:28:15,100 --> 02:28:19,100
Ah, dance dance revolution.

1775
02:28:19,100 --> 02:28:24,100
Good thing I'm good at this.

1776
02:28:24,100 --> 02:28:29,100
I don't know what started Sandstorm, but yeah.

1777
02:28:29,100 --> 02:28:31,100
What?

1778
02:28:31,100 --> 02:28:35,100
Hold on. Let me look at this.

1779
02:28:35,100 --> 02:28:47,100
Ladder and hole that HXF.

1780
02:28:47,100 --> 02:28:50,100
Ladder and hole.

1781
02:28:50,100 --> 02:28:53,100
Oh.

1782
02:28:53,100 --> 02:29:00,100
H, where's the H? There's no H.

1783
02:29:00,100 --> 02:29:06,100
H.

1784
02:29:06,100 --> 02:29:09,100
What the hell am I doing?

1785
02:29:18,100 --> 02:29:23,100
What the heck is that?

1786
02:29:41,100 --> 02:29:43,100
Clock holds all the power.

1787
02:29:43,100 --> 02:29:45,100
Is that the watch then?

1788
02:29:45,100 --> 02:29:54,100
Because clearly this at the bottom here means something.

1789
02:29:54,100 --> 02:29:56,100
Quick, take a mental picture.

1790
02:29:56,100 --> 02:30:01,100
I got a fart.

1791
02:30:01,100 --> 02:30:03,100
Done.

1792
02:30:13,100 --> 02:30:20,100
What the hell?

1793
02:30:20,100 --> 02:30:27,100
You're doing it right if a symbol doesn't go away?

1794
02:30:44,100 --> 02:30:52,100
I didn't even step on anything.

1795
02:30:52,100 --> 02:31:01,100
What the frick?

1796
02:31:01,100 --> 02:31:04,100
Well, I'm going to die.

1797
02:31:04,100 --> 02:31:09,100
Yeah.

1798
02:31:09,100 --> 02:31:12,100
Oh, wait, I see, I see, I see, I see, I see.

1799
02:31:12,100 --> 02:31:14,100
He says the blind man peeing in the wind.

1800
02:31:14,100 --> 02:31:16,100
It's all coming back to me now.

1801
02:31:16,100 --> 02:31:18,100
All right, all right, all right, all right.

1802
02:31:18,100 --> 02:31:19,100
Okay, no ladies.

1803
02:31:19,100 --> 02:31:20,100
Yeah.

1804
02:31:20,100 --> 02:31:21,100
You know what's cooler than being cool?

1805
02:31:21,100 --> 02:31:29,100
Ice cold.

1806
02:31:29,100 --> 02:31:34,100
Fuck.

1807
02:31:34,100 --> 02:31:49,100
Oh, so close.

1808
02:31:49,100 --> 02:31:56,100
Okay, so it's like a path.

1809
02:31:56,100 --> 02:32:03,100
Nope, that's not the right one though.

1810
02:32:03,100 --> 02:32:15,100
That's how my skull just like, oh, I know that's my cross.

1811
02:32:15,100 --> 02:32:24,100
So it's these.

1812
02:32:24,100 --> 02:32:31,100
Okay, so you go across.

1813
02:32:31,100 --> 02:32:34,100
Here.

1814
02:32:34,100 --> 02:32:38,100
Okay, not that one.

1815
02:32:38,100 --> 02:32:46,100
So go across.

1816
02:32:46,100 --> 02:32:47,100
Here.

1817
02:32:47,100 --> 02:32:51,100
Nope.

1818
02:32:51,100 --> 02:33:16,100
What the hell?

1819
02:33:16,100 --> 02:33:17,100
No.

1820
02:33:17,100 --> 02:33:18,100
Okay.

1821
02:33:18,100 --> 02:33:35,100
Da, da, da, da, da, da.

1822
02:33:35,100 --> 02:33:46,100
What?

1823
02:33:46,100 --> 02:33:53,100
I am a little confused.

1824
02:33:53,100 --> 02:33:58,100
Yeah.

1825
02:33:58,100 --> 02:33:59,100
It is.

1826
02:33:59,100 --> 02:34:01,100
It does have to do with the wheel.

1827
02:34:01,100 --> 02:34:02,100
Hello.

1828
02:34:02,100 --> 02:34:09,100
I don't know why I couldn't go down.

1829
02:34:09,100 --> 02:34:24,100
All right.

1830
02:34:24,100 --> 02:34:25,100
Frick.

1831
02:34:25,100 --> 02:34:31,100
Okay, don't go that way.

1832
02:34:31,100 --> 02:34:32,100
Yeah, the wheel is the pattern.

1833
02:34:32,100 --> 02:34:35,100
I just can't remember what the pattern is.

1834
02:34:35,100 --> 02:34:42,100
I'm not going to take a fricking picture with my phone or maybe I should because I can't

1835
02:34:42,100 --> 02:34:56,100
memorize that because it starts at two because it's the clock.

1836
02:34:56,100 --> 02:35:04,100
And you go around, you go bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup.

1837
02:35:04,100 --> 02:35:07,100
That one.

1838
02:35:07,100 --> 02:35:08,100
And then that one.

1839
02:35:08,100 --> 02:35:12,100
Okay.

1840
02:35:12,100 --> 02:35:17,100
But I don't see that symbol.

1841
02:35:17,100 --> 02:35:36,100
But that symbol isn't over here.

1842
02:35:36,100 --> 02:35:41,100
Do I just cross all the way to this one?

1843
02:35:41,100 --> 02:35:42,100
No.

1844
02:35:42,100 --> 02:35:43,100
That doesn't make any sense.

1845
02:35:43,100 --> 02:35:45,100
I'm missing a symbol.

1846
02:35:45,100 --> 02:35:52,100
Just walk onto the hand.

1847
02:35:52,100 --> 02:36:05,100
Oh.

1848
02:36:05,100 --> 02:36:10,100
Cool.

1849
02:36:10,100 --> 02:36:12,100
Nice.

1850
02:36:12,100 --> 02:36:14,100
Nifty.

1851
02:36:14,100 --> 02:36:15,100
Cool.

1852
02:36:15,100 --> 02:36:17,100
These guys are all having a great time.

1853
02:36:17,100 --> 02:36:18,100
I don't really know.

1854
02:36:18,100 --> 02:36:20,100
They kind of look like they're just all just hanging out.

1855
02:36:20,100 --> 02:36:26,100
They got like a mosh, like moshin'.

1856
02:36:26,100 --> 02:36:28,100
Why did I come out of an outhouse?

1857
02:36:28,100 --> 02:36:38,100
That's kind of weird.

1858
02:36:38,100 --> 02:36:39,100
The heck am I?

1859
02:36:39,100 --> 02:36:43,100
How do I help the little boy in the field and why did that tree run away from me?

1860
02:36:43,100 --> 02:36:53,100
Music's so good.

1861
02:36:53,100 --> 02:37:04,100
Doomed to forever wander.

1862
02:37:04,100 --> 02:37:05,100
Oh.

1863
02:37:05,100 --> 02:37:12,100
Look at all these deer.

1864
02:37:12,100 --> 02:37:22,100
Oh.

1865
02:37:22,100 --> 02:37:25,100
I look so funny walking.

1866
02:37:25,100 --> 02:37:28,100
Sometimes it looks like the black on either side of the white, which is supposed to be

1867
02:37:28,100 --> 02:37:30,100
his neck and it's like the face.

1868
02:37:30,100 --> 02:37:40,100
Doesn't that look like a face a little bit?

1869
02:37:40,100 --> 02:37:44,100
A mouth opening going up.

1870
02:37:44,100 --> 02:37:48,100
Okay.

1871
02:37:48,100 --> 02:37:50,100
Hello.

1872
02:37:50,100 --> 02:37:56,100
How do I get out of here?

1873
02:37:56,100 --> 02:37:59,100
Oh my God.

1874
02:37:59,100 --> 02:38:09,100
Can I go back and take a poop?

1875
02:38:09,100 --> 02:38:14,100
It was just flavor.

1876
02:38:14,100 --> 02:38:15,100
Okay.

1877
02:38:15,100 --> 02:38:25,100
How do I leave the woods?

1878
02:38:25,100 --> 02:38:28,100
Do that poop.

1879
02:38:28,100 --> 02:38:30,100
Imagine hiding your cult in an outhouse.

1880
02:38:30,100 --> 02:38:33,100
That's pretty sick.

1881
02:38:33,100 --> 02:38:50,100
Right.

1882
02:38:50,100 --> 02:38:53,100
I'm stuck in pixel slender man.

1883
02:38:53,100 --> 02:38:57,100
I like how I'm going left.

1884
02:38:57,100 --> 02:39:00,100
I need to sit down right.

1885
02:39:00,100 --> 02:39:03,100
Follow the path the trees are taking me.

1886
02:39:03,100 --> 02:39:05,100
Okay.

1887
02:39:05,100 --> 02:39:08,100
I can't tell what you mean.

1888
02:39:08,100 --> 02:39:09,100
Okay.

1889
02:39:09,100 --> 02:39:11,100
All right.

1890
02:39:11,100 --> 02:39:12,100
Because it's a clearing here.

1891
02:39:12,100 --> 02:39:13,100
Let's go.

1892
02:39:13,100 --> 02:39:15,100
We'll go this way.

1893
02:39:15,100 --> 02:39:19,100
Oh.

1894
02:39:19,100 --> 02:39:24,100
These guys are having a great time.

1895
02:39:24,100 --> 02:39:29,100
Okay.

1896
02:39:29,100 --> 02:39:30,100
Okay.

1897
02:39:30,100 --> 02:39:31,100
Okay.

1898
02:39:31,100 --> 02:39:32,100
Okay.

1899
02:39:32,100 --> 02:39:33,100
Okay.

1900
02:39:33,100 --> 02:39:34,100
Okay.

1901
02:39:34,100 --> 02:39:35,100
Okay.

1902
02:39:35,100 --> 02:39:36,100
Okay.

1903
02:39:36,100 --> 02:39:37,100
Okay.

1904
02:39:37,100 --> 02:39:38,100
Okay.

1905
02:39:38,100 --> 02:39:39,100
Okay.

1906
02:39:39,100 --> 02:39:40,100
Okay.

1907
02:39:40,100 --> 02:39:41,100
Okay.

1908
02:39:41,100 --> 02:40:03,100
Okay.

1909
02:40:03,100 --> 02:40:04,100
Okay.

1910
02:40:04,100 --> 02:40:05,100
Okay.

1911
02:40:05,100 --> 02:40:06,100
Okay.

1912
02:40:06,100 --> 02:40:07,100
Okay.

1913
02:40:07,100 --> 02:40:08,100
Okay.

1914
02:40:08,100 --> 02:40:09,100
Okay.

1915
02:40:09,100 --> 02:40:10,100
Okay.

1916
02:40:10,100 --> 02:40:26,100
Okay.

1917
02:40:26,100 --> 02:40:28,100
What.

1918
02:40:28,100 --> 02:40:29,100
What.

1919
02:40:29,100 --> 02:40:30,100
What.

1920
02:40:30,100 --> 02:40:31,100
What.

1921
02:40:31,100 --> 02:40:32,100
Huh?

1922
02:40:32,100 --> 02:40:36,540
Investigators are asking residents to report any suspicious activities to the police.

1923
02:40:36,540 --> 02:40:41,240
Authorities are urging the people of Stirling to not mourn the loss of Atwood, Nogales and

1924
02:40:41,240 --> 02:40:45,740
Inglis because after all, they were degenerate, devil worshipping thugs who were hooked on

1925
02:40:45,740 --> 02:40:46,740
crack.

1926
02:40:46,740 --> 02:40:47,740
Okay.

1927
02:40:47,740 --> 02:40:48,740
That's like, you would like them to think.

1928
02:40:48,740 --> 02:40:49,740
Where did you join?

1929
02:40:49,740 --> 02:40:50,740
There were just three.

1930
02:40:50,740 --> 02:41:07,740
We're actually in the community of favor when you felt I'm getting high in that too.

1931
02:41:07,740 --> 02:41:12,740
We stalked them to the graves and killed them all one by one and ignored their cries

1932
02:41:12,740 --> 02:41:14,740
for help and pleas for mercy.

1933
02:41:15,740 --> 02:41:21,740
We're holes in drug addict bodies that you chopped off their heads because everybody

1934
02:41:21,740 --> 02:41:24,740
knows our heads are the only way to kill a snake.

1935
02:41:24,740 --> 02:41:26,740
Look at us and what?

1936
02:41:30,740 --> 02:41:32,740
You gotta kill a snake, John.

1937
02:41:33,740 --> 02:41:35,740
Can it kill or cannot be killed?

1938
02:41:36,740 --> 02:41:38,740
I wish I'd already saw both of them.

1939
02:41:38,740 --> 02:41:40,740
Okay, let's both put it down again.

1940
02:41:40,740 --> 02:41:42,740
Now I'm gonna spot the kill, baby.

1941
02:41:42,740 --> 02:41:45,740
I wish I wanted to try my works for the end of the works.

1942
02:41:45,740 --> 02:41:47,740
The end turns around again.

1943
02:41:50,740 --> 02:41:51,740
That's all.

1944
02:41:51,740 --> 02:41:54,740
If it now sheds out, then I don't want it.

1945
02:41:54,740 --> 02:41:56,740
My hand does not die for it.

1946
02:41:56,740 --> 02:41:58,740
You see your fault.

1947
02:41:58,740 --> 02:42:01,740

2067
03:00:57,920 --> 03:01:04,440
That the mom mentions in the beginning and that you don't see in the picture at the family photo because she lost them

2068
03:01:04,440 --> 03:01:06,680
And she thinks they're probably like alive still

2069
03:01:08,160 --> 03:01:10,160
Excuse me

2070
03:01:13,520 --> 03:01:15,520

It's father Garcia father Garcia. What are you doing here?

03:01:48,520 --> 03:01:53,000
That's true because you're the gray dude from earlier the team up

2077
03:02:04,640 --> 03:02:07,120
Honestly if this was made into a horror movie it would be incredible

2078
03:02:08,000 --> 03:02:13,200
And you just had a really like moody lighting all the time that matches the rooms. Oh, that would be so great

It's just funny to think of it as like this angry hag. That's trying to kill me

2260
03:25:53,560 --> 03:25:59,680
Angry hag cult leader. This is angry woman. What the fuck boomie

2261
03:26:05,480 --> 03:26:09,700
Oh, oh, it's time for boomy snuggles. Oh boomy sniffing the mic time

2262
03:26:10,640 --> 03:26:12,640
But the boomy time

2263
03:26:13,080 --> 03:26:16,780
This one's for the one with the boom and system top down to the training the boom

2264
03:26:17,700 --> 03:26:19,700
Oh

2265
03:26:23,940 --> 03:26:31,580
Are you here to make me feel better angry hag we love those here. Yeah, she does like how I cook a bus

2266
03:26:39,700 --> 03:26:43,100
Boomy is here. He'd be sniffing the tomagotchi. He's checking on Fia

2267
03:26:44,100 --> 03:26:48,060
Yeah, just huffed at him like a telling him, please don't come over here

2268
03:26:48,820 --> 03:26:52,900
And lay on me here. Why don't you why don't you just be held by me boomy?

2269
03:26:57,260 --> 03:26:59,260
Raina sat on Fia's head

2270
03:26:59,580 --> 03:27:05,620
When I was napping well, I was about to start napping and I'm falling asleep and then Raina crawls on me

2271
03:27:05,620 --> 03:27:07,620
but like my body doesn't register it and

2272
03:27:07,820 --> 03:27:12,940
And then I hear Fia squeak and Raina's just completely sat on her head

2273
03:27:19,820 --> 03:27:25,040
So I had to move her and then Raina was no then Fia was playing with Raina's tail. It was cute

2274
03:27:38,620 --> 03:27:45,940
How did you kill me usually after a little bit of time it goes away

2275
03:27:47,100 --> 03:27:50,420
Boomy you can't be on my desk right now handsome boy. Oh

2276
03:27:51,740 --> 03:27:57,100
You're stop boomy, please. You're knocking over stuff boomy

2277
03:27:58,300 --> 03:28:00,860

2278
03:28:08,620 --> 03:28:10,620

03:28:56,820 --> 03:28:58,820
Don't go for Father Garcia

2282
03:29:08,020 --> 03:29:10,620
Don't tell me I got to do this shit like three times cuz I'll be pissed

2283
03:29:31,900 --> 03:29:33,900
I don't get it

2284
03:29:33,940 --> 03:29:38,100
Literally with the time usually the time I put on her

2285
03:29:39,660 --> 03:29:45,220
Holding up the cross that kills her. I don't understand that I

2286
03:29:47,420 --> 03:29:51,540
Don't I don't get it. I just don't it's not consistent

2287
03:29:53,100 --> 03:29:57,460
Because sometimes I barely have to do it sometimes I have to do it forever sometimes I don't have to do it at all

2288
03:30:04,460 --> 03:30:06,460
I

2289
03:30:10,620 --> 03:30:12,820
Yes, this is harder than elder drink bro

2290
03:30:29,180 --> 03:30:33,060
I'm honestly about to turn off the sound because it's starting to irritate me you know what I'm doing that

2291
03:30:34,340 --> 03:30:36,340
I'm tired of hearing it

2292
03:30:37,940 --> 03:30:42,940
You know what you guys aren't gonna hear it either we're just gonna hear my my lovely background music

2293
03:30:50,260 --> 03:30:54,620
Cuz I'm tired of hearing this screaming it's kind of just like grating on my ears at this point

2294
03:31:04,900 --> 03:31:06,900
I

2295
03:31:09,900 --> 03:31:11,900
Where are you going? Okay

2296
03:31:14,820 --> 03:31:16,940
It's like funnier with the sound off

2297
03:31:18,460 --> 03:31:24,220
Because this looks silly I would definitely say a big part of the

2298
03:31:27,300 --> 03:31:29,300
The game is the sound

2299
03:31:30,300 --> 03:31:34,180
Because this this looks funny. No, I

2300
03:31:36,420 --> 03:31:40,340
Really got a backup when she does the fucking slow walk. Yeah

2301
03:31:41,700 --> 03:31:43,700

2318
03:33:49,700 --> 03:33:55,100
It's also like dependent on where Garcia is cuz like sometimes I just can't be close to him

2319
03:33:55,460 --> 03:33:57,460
That

2320
03:34:05,860 --> 03:34:07,860
