00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You

7
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You

9
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You

10
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Lol

11
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,200
Hey, wait say something. Oh

12
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,200
Oh

13
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:07,600
You're not in here, why isn't it working? What if I unplugged this sometimes sometimes my goal XLR like transfers stuff really weirdly

14
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:17,320
Yeah, like you're yeah, you're my Tulpa nobody can hear

15
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:28,360
I'm sorry, you guys can't hear all the funny stuff that trinket is saying to me

16
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,160
Sometimes my goal XLR were transfer

17
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,520
stuff

18
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,820
Let me see. I just have to click through a bunch of crap and hope that it works

19
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,600
Start singing or something

20
00:06:54,200 --> 00:07:03,360
Why I want it it doesn't want to pick that up hold on maybe if I go to properties

21
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,760
That was really good though, it was really good too, they'll never know oh

22
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,840
What if I do say something

23
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:28,400
Why doesn't it want to pick up on what?

24
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Maybe that'll be a bummer

25
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,960
Just from Firefox. Oh, there it is there they go. Yeah, there you are. Okay. Let me turn you down a bit

26
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,840
PoE fixed

27
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,880
Harlots she's here

28
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:59,880
Curse collab never curse couldn't be us. We're so lucky everything works out for us

29
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:08,840
Only members can hear her voice. I would be interesting. She was spitting bars. You guys missed out

30
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,000
Let me pull up the smash or pass window

31
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,200
hell yeah, uh

32
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,560
Trinket is currently cooking up a mup itself

33
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,440
I am are you giving yourself a Scooby-Doo caller?

34
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,240
That's always been in the plans

35
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,520
Up always the jam. I love it

36
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:37,400
Because Scooby-Doo is well, he's not my first choice husband, but he's definitely like

37
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,960
on the list of

38
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,800
Cartoon characters that would be an automatic smash for me. Yeah

39
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,240
Yeah

40
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:52,000
But like if I take Scooby I have to take the rest of the the mystery game you understand I understand

41
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,000
because like

42
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,800
Actually, I was talking about this on Sunday because I've been on a real Omegaverse kick lately. Mm-hmm

43
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,600
And so I yeah, I sent me some of my diverse stuff

44
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:11,040
Because I've been recommended to it by in budding friendship, but I'm really enjoying it, but

45
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,720
In my mind, right? Mm-hmm in my mind

46
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,440
There is like this the Scooby-Doo game, right?

47
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,680
Chaggy is very much an alpha

48
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,120
And so and so is

49
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,480
Okay

50
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:35,920
Fred is a very beta male. Okay, but he's got Omega tendencies. All right

51
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,960
Daphne is a straight-up

52
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:45,640
Beta with Omega tendencies, but she's more like badass. All right, that's beta and then

53
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,200
Velma is nothing but pure Omega energy

54
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:56,680
Like Velma's been with everybody on the crew. Velma's just like the comfort creature in the mystery ink machine

55
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,680
I never would have thought of this like

56
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,760
If the gang or Omegaverse, that's you know

57
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:19,200
That's just that's just that's just how it goes. That's just how it be. I don't think I'm wrong. I

58
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:28,320
Think I'm more right than anything honestly. Yeah, Trinket's getting me into Omegaverse stuff. So blame her for anything

59
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:34,840
Like if madam she be starts calling you guys submissive and readable some of you might be Omega's

60
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,080
Well, it looks like I have some inappropriate stuff on my screen, but I promise I don't

61
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,480
You know

62
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:49,880
The whole stream is gonna be inappropriate, but you know pop offs pop off singular window. That's blurred pop off

63
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It's from the the sucker punch stream, I know I was there

64
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,880
Yes, I know you were there I

65
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:07,000
Really like suck a sucker punch with all you guys. It was really good. Did you like it?

66
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,720
I mean, I was a little confused, but I see where it's going for yeah

67
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:17,920
Like it's um, it's like American McGee's Alice in Wonderland. Yeah

68
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,400
But like a little more a little more nuance. Mm-hmm

69
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,320
Like it's a it's a fantasy within a fantasy

70
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:34,440
Within a real situation that she's just dissociating the whole time with precisely

71
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,360
It's very oops, it's very

72
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:46,240
Frick did I accidentally smash the wooden version

73
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:52,480
So I'm so glad that that manlet didn't say her at the very oh, yeah

74
00:11:53,400 --> 00:12:00,120
Anything that he wanted from the situation. Yeah Oscar Oscar Isaac got what was coming from blue

75
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,860
And then like and then he was a snitch at the very end. I know it was ridiculous

76
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,300
He's oh, he's so frustrating, but pretty

77
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:15,140
Like that the girls actually died that the orderlies kill them

78
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:18,300
I think the order that's what I was thinking about as I was falling asleep

79
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,220
after stream, I'm like

80
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,860
Because every time I watch the movie I like think of other

81
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,100
things like different like parallels and stuff and I'm like cuz

82
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:34,860
Doc the doctor never said that two other patients died. She just said she started a fire

83
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:40,020
And got let one escape some but I'm I still think that they died a hundred percent

84
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:43,700
You know, you know what could have happened because like and like insane

85
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:47,100
Asylums were so bad during the time period that I'm presuming this yeah

86
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:52,500
It looks like it was like the 50s or 60s or something like they might have died due to treatment

87
00:12:54,500 --> 00:13:00,020
With their death by just giving it to an orderly because the orderlies would take patients away. Yeah

88
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,580
That's a good. That's a very

89
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,180
Good observe

90
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:08,740
Observation hundred percent. Sorry. I'm half asleep so I can barely form words

91
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,580
That's okay. I've got more than double words. I

92
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:21,320
Didn't do like the New York Times wordal bullshit, but like I'll I'll make up some I'll make up some nouns and some adjectives for you

93
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,260
A E I O U Y

94
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,940
Okay, W X nice

95
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,540
Fabulous

96
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:36,900
Maybe maybe is maybe a cue the maybe a cue a rare cue in there a rare cue

97
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,660
I'm barely following

98
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,420
All right

99
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:51,300
How are you going with your Muppet version we might we might transform to Muppets I

100
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:56,340
Guess I just got to do the one thing for the hair and then

101
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,500
Let's see

102
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:04,900
All I got to do is do my little pinkies little pinkies little pinkie poos

103
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:09,940
Yeah, my little pinkie poos it it makes it makes the look. I'm very fashionable

104
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:13,780
You always have to have a bit of pop, you know, I agree

105
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,100
Pull up my food you took

106
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,700
So I can just have my Muppet self next to me

107
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:26,140
Because there there is a Muppet, but it's of the monkey. Oh

108
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,420
Yeah, I'm Toma like how you call her the monkey

109
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,940
Ignore the random browser source on my screen

110
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,140
There we are

111
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:55,700
Wait, I'll have to go into

112
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,420
Flip it horizontally, I do have to flip it horizontally

113
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,540
Or we swap places because of the way that I

114
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,740
Looks like we're gonna have a great conversation

115
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:14,740
It's like my mic just constantly on in this call. What the hell I

116
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,900
Mean, there's a little bit of

117
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,740
Was it my fucking AC

118
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:24,660
But that's not that's not bad. I kind of like it. It's a nice background

119
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:29,260
I appreciate that everyone likes my background noise. I

120
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,460
Mean, it's it's like the white noise

121
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:36,740
It's like when you're sitting out on a on a hot porch and you're listening to the summer rain

122
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,420
And you get that nice rain smell and you just

123
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,300
And you just snored it

124
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:45,900
Yeah, you you snort the rain you snort the rain smell

125
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:55,420
Absolutely. Oh my god. All right. I have my little mini me next to me and now she talks when she's supposed to

126
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,980
Hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah

127
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,380
I'm almost done

128
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,620
Take your time

129
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,620
I'm just staring at this ugly wooden ball

130
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,260
He is the world

131
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,380
I

132
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,940
Hate him

133
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:21,220
Just he's so ugly. Why did they make him made out of wood? They had they had metal

134
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:26,780
Why is his top made out of wood? I don't know. I feel like they could have also put that part on the bottom

135
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,260
They could have

136
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:37,860
Actually when they did it for a wool tour but looks even crazier, so he looks better than wool tour at least

137
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:45,220
Splinters very true. I'd like to talk with Muppet she be after stream about what?

138
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,980
About what?

139
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:54,420
You have with this Muppet. Yeah, what business do you have with this Muppet?

140
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:04,020
You want to throw it at a wall that hurts that hurts me deeply

141
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:10,460
I mean, there is that trend where people like buy Fumos, right and they just beat them and then they yeah

142
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,980
Kind of soak them in milk and throw them at a wall

143
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:20,540
Of course, I don't think your demographic wants to soak them in milk. Yeah, probably not milk, but something probably

144
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,420
Similar to that

145
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:29,620
Wait, why did they why did they put Fumos and milk? I

146
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,580
Don't

147
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:41,020
What's the you know, I I couldn't tell you why anybody does anything except you know for the laughs

148
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:46,500
Yeah, just for the laughs for some twisted laughs

149
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,500
Just for just for a little hee-hee hoo-hoo ha ha, you know

150
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:57,500
It's a little tee-hee's a little tee-hee hee-hee's. I'm speaking of which I need a tweet hee-hee hee-hee hee's

151
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,180
Hee-hee hee-hee

152
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,300
Hee-hee hee-hee hee-hee hee-hee

153
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,700
I love the out-of-pocket

154
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,740
thumbnail

155
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,740
My manager made for me. I

156
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,100
Also like it. It's very different. I wasn't even gonna bother covering it up

157
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:20,180
And then it's been up for a while and hasn't gotten demonetized. So it's fun

158
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:26,180
Well, that's because ass and boobs is different you can have ass because no boobs butts are funny

159
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:29,620
No, yeah, because I just have a front butt on my chest

160
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:36,020
Yeah, you do but there's also like the risk of having like that female presenting nipple. I

161
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:42,660
Couldn't have a female presenting nipple on my butt. She maybe

162
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:55,900
Like a raised mole like a pimple like a butt pimple. Oh gross. No, but no butt pimples here. Please. No, thank you

163
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,460
All right

164
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,420
Tweeted I

165
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,420
Forgot to tag you

166
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,580
That's okay. I'll retweet it. I'll find it

167
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,660
I am a mess

168
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:16,620
That's okay. You're running on what an hour of sleep essentially not even more like ten minutes

169
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:25,540
That's a power nap. That's like the ten minute power hour, but you know a little bit shorter than a ten minute power hour now

170
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,020
RIP original game grumps. I know right

171
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,420
Not the pimples

172
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:43,180
Amy would love that. Yeah, cuz well though. Yeah, we like to pop zits, but I don't want one on my butt

173
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:48,700
Oh, yeah, no, that's awful, but it's a popping videos are very nice

174
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,660
I love watching pimple popping videos

175
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:55,980
It's just like I could sit there for hours and just get sucked into a rabbit hole of just pimple popping videos

176
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,820
right

177
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,820
Yeah, do you ever just like enjoy?

178
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,820
Looking at it like the ear wax removal ones as well

179
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:08,380
I I watched it ear wax removal one the other way, but for some odd reason that

180
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:16,460
Actually grosses me out a little bit, but like but which is weird cuz like I like to watch like the really like big

181
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,460
cyst pops like the like

182
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:24,380
Dr. Pimple Popper. Yeah, like the really gross one. So I don't know why ear wax just like

183
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:31,900
Doesn't do it for me, but I watched your brain. Yeah, maybe yeah, maybe cuz it's yeah, it's not something

184
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,700
It's not like being extract. Well, it is being extracted. It's not being like

185
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:38,140
Pushed I don't know how to explain it. It's the act

186
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:43,340
It's the act of unless it's um, I did watch one in this person

187
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:46,700
Just like twirled a little tool in their ear and just like yoinked it out and I was like whoa

188
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,740
That's really cool. I wish I could get my ears professionally cleaned

189
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:54,300
You can if you get like one of those

190
00:20:55,020 --> 00:21:00,520
Watery things like a water pig you could just point it at your ear and you can irrigate your ear. Oh

191
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:06,660
Soffeting drops boom. I feel like I would just give myself an ear infection just

192
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:13,800
Somehow cuz I'm sometimes prone to those I would definitely just like end up giving myself an ear infection

193
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:19,920
Honestly, I always get ear infections and I always get like sore throats at the beginning of the year

194
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,360
No, honestly every new years. I'm like, this is the year

195
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:28,320
I'm gonna ask the ask the dentist to take my tonsils out. Oh, I've asked them

196
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:33,240
They said told me no cuz I have like enlarged tonsils. They're like, you know bigger tonsils than normal

197
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,560
I'm like great yoink them out. I'm tired of them

198
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,040
Cuz they're just like I don't know. I don't like open my mouth and I'm just like

199
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,080
Not that they're noticeable, but like whatever I poke around in my mouth a lot. It sounds weird. I don't know

200
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,380
You ever you ever get one of those like tonsil stones

201
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,160
Yes, I hate them. That's yeah

202
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,620
You're always like you're always just trying to draw it up and then like it feels like you're gagging. Yeah

203
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:12,140
It's so gross, it's I hate them they smell like death smells like a dead grandma

204
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:17,140
And no matter how much you brush your teeth your breath never gets any better when you have one

205
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,980
Yeah, that's why sometimes I'll just check make sure

206
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:24,500
Because my my tonsils are bigger sometimes I'll like get one and I'm like, ah

207
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:29,100
No, that's why I'm just like just let me let me just like laser them off

208
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,340
So I don't ever have to get tonsil stones ever again. Oh

209
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,620
I forgot I was gonna say

210
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,780
Doesn't matter

211
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,820
I'm EP second

212
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,540
So I'm just like what do I talk about next

213
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,940
The infinity tonsil stones gross. Oh

214
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,780
Oh

215
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:06,340
That's like. Oh god, it's tonsil stones all the way down like

216
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:14,820
But it could be worse it could be worse it could be kidney stones. That's true kidney stones are horrible. I've heard I

217
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:19,940
Have never had one. They're probably all resting inside me like hidden diamonds

218
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:26,020
No, then you would be be peeing just pure fire

219
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,020
Constantly

220
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:34,940
But like also I feel like you could make jewelry if you were just an infinite kidney stone source

221
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:40,580
It's more like from what I've heard it's more of like a sandy

222
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,220
Granule rather than like a stone stone

223
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:49,020
Yeah, but what if you like sand it and smooth it like you get like just like a little roller

224
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,780
Yeah, yeah

225
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:55,700
Make a little kidney stone ring and then be like I want you to have this

226
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:03,700
My piss buddy, my buddy and it's like this is a part of me that I'm giving to you. We are pistars and arms

227
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,540
Yep, yep

228
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:18,220
Truly truly that's how that's how we roll in this household. Hmm. I

229
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:23,860
Had tonsils taking out cuz constant ear infections. Oh, that's the word. That's the worst

230
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,780
That's why I wanted to get the cuz I also um, I

231
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:30,460
Have because of inflammation in my neck for my arthritis

232
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:36,380
I'm one of my eustachian tubes are always kind of like sort of blocked and I was hoping if I got my tonsil removed

233
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:40,220
It would like help with that because I'm just like I feel it

234
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,480
I'm sometimes like deaf in my right ear because I'm like what?

235
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,820
Why I

236
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:50,060
Can't hear what you're saying. It's like the weirdest feeling having your ear blocked

237
00:24:52,060 --> 00:25:00,380
Hi Rena, all right, I hope my art program unfreezes itself soon so I can finish saving this magnificent muppet that I've drawn

238
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,860
It is quite gorgeous. You guys are not ready

239
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:11,060
Let me go back in to share my no not share my screen. Oh wait you ended it. Oh

240
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:15,780
I'm sorry. I guess. No, you're fine. You're fine. Okay

241
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,260
I wanted to look at where you were at

242
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:25,940
Oh, I finished it. You think trinket could be turned up a little bit more. I can do that for you. Whoo

243
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:37,540
Someone thrown her that horn thing that people used to hear better

244
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:45,060
It happens because I'm 56. That's correct. Did you know that wax candles don't work?

245
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,700
Like what do you mean?

246
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:54,740
Like there's like this old wives tale where if you put like some foil and a candle in your ear. Oh

247
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,500
Yeah, ear candling. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

248
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,940
It doesn't do anything

249
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,180
Have you tried it?

250
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:05,100
No, I did research on it. I

251
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:11,500
Swear I've done it before when I was a kid and it worked. I don't know. I kind of just been tripping as a child

252
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:15,020
I mean, I'm totally delusional as children. Yeah

253
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:19,340
Maybe but like I feel like I feel like

254
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,060
Maybe

255
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,460
Yes, I forget there is the science behind it

256
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:32,300
It's the science behind it and there's it's a big scam. It's the paper cone works not wax

257
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:37,260
Oh, maybe I was the paper cone that I had. Hello. Hello. Welcome in

258
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,260
Time candles or wax play

259
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:50,860
Oh, wait, nope. Oh, the monkey's here. No

260
00:26:54,300 --> 00:27:00,140
I was trying to do the car. Monkey jumpscare monkey monkey Muppet jumpscare. Whoops

261
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:09,500
Hold on. I got I got you. I got you. I'm just waiting with excitement

262
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:14,060
It's the debut everyone's been waiting for

263
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:23,420

00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,740
Okay, okay, okay, okay

268

Okay, I think I think we got it. Yeah, blam

269
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,740
Oh

There she is

271
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,660
She's so cute

272
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,540
There we go

273
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,940
I can't believe it. I'm gonna flip you

274
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,100
um

275
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,100
Hold on a moment

276
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:06,380
30 minutes not bad. Yeah, yeah, you did that in uh, honestly a quick amount of time

277
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,780
Poy fuked

278
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,180
Play fuked play fuked and now

279
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,060
I will remove my

280
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,340
Excuse me to deform

281
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,500
Farewell

282
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:26,060
I may make you a little bit

283
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:32,940
But I think I'm smaller than you you are so I'm gonna I thought as much

284
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:37,500
I'm just a little just a little we look so great

285
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,420
Just a bunch of muppets

286
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:49,660
In your little hands, where's your wait, where's your other hand? It's it's it's resting. I'm tired

287
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,620
It's resting

288
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,060
Ah

289
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:58,780
My hand's not up. I'm polite. I have my hands in a polite position because I'm a guest here

290
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:03,020
Because it looks like you have two hands up your butt

291
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:06,060
I might

292
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:16,220
This is this is muppet time with uh trinket and sheafy

293
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:24,380
We're gonna we're gonna smash and pass some balls. Yeah, okay. We already I think we already passed on this one, didn't we?

294
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:27,580
Yeah, we passed on we passed on these wooden balls. Yeah

295
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:32,460
The splinters aren't worth it. No, no, thank you. I'm good with that

296
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,660
Never saw this episode of the muppets while you're about to

297
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:39,180
Be the best episode you've ever seen

298
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,900
Uh execute these are eggs

299
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:45,340
How to eat them um

300
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,940
I could I could see them being useful though

301
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:55,980
You know like you could be into obvi position. I was thinking that I'm not into that but I get it

302
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:02,140
Because like I've I've read I've read some I've read some mangoes in my in my history

303
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:03,980
and

304
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,980
you know

305
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:08,060
Sometimes sometimes

306
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:12,780
Sometimes you're just introduced a little too early to some things and they're just with you for life

307
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:15,980
That's very accurate. I agree with that statement

308
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:22,220
So like honestly, it's a it's a smash and eat for these. It's a smash and eat

309
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,860
I it's it's just a pass and eat for me

310
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:30,540
Do you think do you think the body has the ability to boil eggs if you like put them in there though?

311
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:41,500
I don't know let's try with the chicken egg and I'll get back to you

312
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,740
It's okay

313
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:48,140
Oh my goodness body well actually

314
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:51,340
No, because what's the body the body's?

315
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,220
basal temperature

316
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,380
Is like 97. I I bet

317
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,100
How how much the boiling?

318
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:06,140
Rate for water isn't like 110 or something Fahrenheit. So what you're telling me is we need to find a sick person

319
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,380
Have them put the eggs up there

320
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,820
And then have the lady eggs and then you could have like

321
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:16,540
A sentry style boiled egg from another woman. That's perfect

322
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:22,460
So 100 degrees Celsius. Yeah, so yeah, it's essentially what we do for like 10 to 12 minutes do that

323
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:25,740
Yeah, this is an experiment that I think should actually happen

324
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,700
It would be like a tea egg

325
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,020
Yeah, like a little quail egg

326
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,580
Tuck it up your butthole

327
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:37,420
If any of you guys get sick with the fever, I need you to do this. Uh, this is uh

328
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:41,260
This is a question. This is a request for you

329
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:45,580
It takes 300 700 slaps to cook a whole chicken

330
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,060
What?

331
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:51,100
I I mean, I guess if you just keep slapping it

332
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:55,340
I feel like that would have to be 700 slaps at all at once. Wouldn't it?

333
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:00,940
No, no, no like seven like it the heat would build up probably maybe

334
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:05,740
If I if I slap my ass 700 times

335
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,860
You're that

336
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:18,860
Can't be helped you're cooked at that point. I'm cooked. Yeah, I'm cooked so cooked. All right executor

337
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:25,420
He could be cuter. He could be cuter eggs that could be cuter, you know

338
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,940
But I like his dopey face

339
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:34,060
He's got three of them. I mean I give him a smooch, but I move on

340
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,060
Yeah

341
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:40,300
Really? I definitely kiss like one of the faces. Yeah, maybe not one in the back

342
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,460
He looks like a kisser

343
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:48,700
I gave him a little smooch and I feel like he would get like bashful like uh like bashful from um

344
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,180
the

345
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:54,620
I almost said the wizard of Oz uh snow white

346
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:01,820
Okay, but the apple-throwing trees in the wizard of Oz might might hit for some people, you know

347
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:07,500
They definitely might definitely hit people. That's that's that's totally true

348
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:10,780
Oh my gosh, I haven't seen the wizard of Oz in such a long time

349
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:14,060
Uh, what about the tall boy version?

350
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,540
Oh, that's a smash

351
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,140
Why?

352
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,820
I mean

353
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,820
He's like six one

354
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,780
I almost spit out my tea

355
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:31,900
How tall is the executor elolan version he's seven feet tall he's seven throat goat

356
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,780
Five was a dude then yes

357
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:38,860
I mean are you a tree hugger trinket?

358
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:45,500
I mean tree humper in nature in my nature. That's a good point. It's in my nature. That's a good point

359
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,260
I'm gonna pass

360
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,860
I'm gonna smash

361
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,060
um

362
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:59,100
Cubone I would just want to take care of this little cute baby. That's it. I mean he is an orphan

363
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,980
Yeah, I'd be a good mom

364
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:07,020
You would I think I I I'd you know treat him right

365
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:12,780
Make sure he's not too traumatized by his mother's death and make him work stop wearing his mom's skull

366
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:17,820
I you can just keep it, but like I don't want to wear it. That's that's not really good

367
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,620
you know

368
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:23,260
That's not a good healthy. No, it's not healthy

369
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:25,180
But you know

370
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:27,820
I have this theory about cubone. Uh-huh

371
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:32,620
I think cubones like once they get over the loss of their mother become kengis kongs

372
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,860
Oh, yeah

373
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,380
I feel like

374
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:39,500
In a distant dream. We've had this conversation before

375
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:45,500
Or maybe I with a with a particular cat. I'm not sure

376
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:48,140
um

377
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:51,820
All right, so what would you do? I kind of want to eat it at the same time

378
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:55,260
Is it messed up that I kind of want to cook it in its mom's skulls a little bowl?

379
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:59,820
I mean we do the same thing with bread bowls. Exactly

380
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:04,700
So like I don't see anything wrong with it. All right. Okay. I feel a little bit better about that now

381
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:09,500
It's kind of like the same sort of principle. Do you feel bad when you have scrambled eggs and chicken?

382
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,980
Oh, that's a good point

383
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,740
I can't believe eggs are just chicken periods

384
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:19,020
I think about that often

385
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:24,060
It's kind of messed up sometimes you can get lucky with a double yoker. That's true

386
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:27,020
That chicken would have had twins

387
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:32,940
Imagine if women's eggs were that big when we had our periods

388
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:39,660
God that would fucking suck. I would hate my life even more than I already do getting a period. Oh my god

389
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:45,980
But what if it came out so easily like an egg like once a month like bomb actually that would be nice

390
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:50,060
Because if it was if I just had to lay an egg once a month and that was all I had to do

391
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:54,460
Instead of being pained for eight days and just bleed heavily then um

392
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:57,180
Yeah, I'd rather lay an egg

393
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,500
And then you can eat it, right?

394
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:06,220
Yeah, absolutely like almost like when pregnant women eat the prosenta. It's probably has like nutritional properties just like normal eggs

395
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:09,660
Honestly, it would probably open up a new market

396
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:16,700
And like there would be so less like human hunger like just get yourself a woman to lay you an egg. Yeah

397
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:20,220
I feel and then yeah, the whole like egg industry

398
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:24,780
Would be a very different place guys. I think we should make this happen

399
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:28,060
Honestly, how do we get women to start laying eggs?

400
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:31,340
Honestly new work class

401
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:36,860
But then again like do they well

402
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:41,660
Does the egg stay inside when when it's fertilized?

403
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:45,180
Oh, that's a good point

404
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:54,380
Hmm, huh. Hmm. You have to workshop that. Yeah, okay. I'm gonna pass. Uh, Marowak

405
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,940
I'm good. I'm good. It's a pass for me. Okay

406
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:12,060
This one's kind of cool looking but it's just repainted and made skinny

407
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:17,260
Basically, it's slim though. Yeah, I'm Marowak but cooler

408
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,540
Burn the work mom

409
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:23,260
Yeah, yeah, he's like a little like scene kid

410
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:27,820
Going through her golf girl phase before she becomes a mom

411
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,780
Hitman Lee

412
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:36,540
Man's got legs and arms no mouth though. Yeah

413
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,740
What no mouth don't do it's kind of disappointing

414
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:43,980
I mean you could still sit on the face. It'd just be more like a mutual rub

415
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:48,300
You could use the you could use the legs as a grinder

416
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,900
You could and maybe the face as a grinder

417
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:57,260
He's also got fingers. That's a good point. I don't know. I just don't feel

418
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:00,220
I'm not feeling anything with this, you know

419
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:04,140
Yeah, there's there's not enough defining features. Yeah

420
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:09,500
He's kind of like and he's kind of like a faceless man from a hentai. Yeah

421
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,980
I

422
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,620
Like he just needs like protagonist hair

423
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:17,980
Could be like the self-insert and then you're golden

424
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,220
For what he is

425
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:25,660
But then I would if he looked more like the the faceless protagonist because the faceless protagonist

426
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:30,300
Always has a mouth and like long hair covering their eyes if it was reversed

427
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:32,780
I would I would then I would say yes

428
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,580
But this is not the case so

429
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:41,500
Pass he's a pass. Uh hitman chan. Hitman chance of smash. Yeah

430
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:45,980
Yeah, very cute. I like their outfit. She got a little skirt going

431
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:52,620
I bet I bet the I bet the third leg has a little boxing glove at the end

432
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,620
Bro I need a drink for this

433
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,340
Hahaha

434
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,940
I always thought hitman chan was a girl

435
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,620
Because it's just chan and she's wearing a dress

436
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:15,020
It could be a girl or a boy. Oh, okay. I don't know. I just always saw it like that

437
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:18,140
Uh, I'm just feel like I'd be kind of scared because I feel like they'll be very

438
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:22,780
Fisting and if you're saying there's a little glove at the end of that then I'm even more terrified

439
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:26,700
I mean, it's just it's just punching up at the inside door

440
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:32,700
Yeah, my inside door just got really scared and quivered in fear

441
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:36,140
They're 100 male. Okay, then I'm

442
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,620
Riona. Yeah for yeah a little riona

443
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:42,540
But I would rather like an actual fist than a glove for that

444
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,540
You know

445
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:49,180
I I would hate to think that like it has a little hand at the end of its third leg though

446
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,980
I'd hate to think that

447
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,460
passing

448
00:39:55,260 --> 00:40:02,300
Yeah, they've always been cute to me. I'm a smash hitman champ. You're gonna have okay understandable. Um look at tongue

449
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,540
Oh, that

450
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:09,020
The conversation doesn't need to be I know it's it's a no-brainer to be honest with you

451
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,900
smash

452
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:16,300
The tongue king the gluck look five thousands

453
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:23,340
Throat goat throat goat, you know, probably no gag reflex because he swallows just about anything you give him precisely

454
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,420
A call him Kirby the way he swallows

455
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:30,060
Coughing

456
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,300
That's a pass

457
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,940
I like the pause we both had we're just like

458
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:40,780
Like if I were a guy

459
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:44,220
And I had like an air purifier

460
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,900
Maybe use the holes for something

461
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,340
Yeah

462
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,220
Yeah

463
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:55,660
Tuck a little honestly by default. No, that's a pass. Yeah, that's that's I feel like I would just die

464
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:58,060
Like I something would happen and then same with wheezing

465
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:02,620
I mean unless it's like that dank's uh coming out of there. No

466
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:06,940
Yeah, like I just feel like it just smells like farts or it's gonna kill me so

467
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:08,940
Yeah

468
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:13,340
Like if he wasn't like an abuser and you could burn that that that magic leaf in him probably

469
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,340
Yeah

470
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:21,980
Now this one just looks like a gentleman who's wanting to pay for a good time

471
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,500
Bring me your finest

472
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,580
courtesans

473
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:31,260
Like he you just see him on the street. He's got a little he's got his top hats

474
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:36,620
You give him a little cane and he's like, excuse me, madam. How much for you think I've got about

475
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,020
20 dimma dome dollars

476
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:45,660
I have about 20 pounds to pound your life away if you'll have me of course

477
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,740
um

478
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:53,180
I'll pass but I would I would I would entertain him for a bit, but then I wouldn't let him hit

479
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:57,820
Honestly, if he spoke to me like the high roller from sucker punch

480
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:05,660
Just like sucker punch sucker punch high roller have me like yeah, john ham

481
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:08,620
Cancel man john ham

482
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:18,540
Yeah, what about this rocky unicorn?

483
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:23,660
Uh, you know, I bet is very right horny

484
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:29,980
I mean, I mean, there's there's there's three different ways to mount it

485
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:33,420
Yeah, you have a lot of ridges

486
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,420
to ride

487
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:38,780
So like, you know, it's for it's for you and the besties

488
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:41,580
Yeah, that's definitely like a group

489
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:44,540
activity, um

490
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:50,220
But like what if you're alone and it tries to sit on you or like mount you I think I would just die

491
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:56,460
No, he's a he's a rock. He's a rock monster. No. Yeah, I'm gonna pass because like at some point

492
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:59,740
He's gonna ask why I'm not giving

493
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:05,180
And I want to be able to provide that's you know, what a good partner does, you know balance

494
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:09,980
Give and take I mean you'd have to knock him on his back and like strand him like a turtle

495
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:13,980
I feel like yeah, and I don't even think he could be on his back right like normally

496
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:17,340
You'd have to do like sideways because his little back horn

497
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:22,620
Yeah, he'd definitely freak out. Yeah, I feel like he would just not have a great time. We're just not compatible

498
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:27,660
No, no, he's too big. We're too squishy. We're muppets. We're muppets

499
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:30,540
Uh ride on

500
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:36,300
It's kind of more doable. Yeah. Hello. It's called ride on. Why would I not ride on on the ride on?

501
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:40,380
He's he's also got that physique like a dad bod

502
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:42,940
You know, I like me. I like me a dad bod

503
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:47,180
You know what he feels like he could be the male version of a kengis kong

504
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:51,180
I always thought that I always thought he was the male version of it because they look

505
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:54,380
Precisely the same minus the pouch in the color scheme

506
00:43:55,100 --> 00:44:01,020
Right and there's like it's almost like uh the males are smaller because the kengis kongs are quite large

507
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:05,820
But then again, they're probably like in the same like egg class too. So

508
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:10,620
I'll smash. What about you? I'll smash it as well. Yeah

509
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:15,260
Chancey, I'm pretty sure that horn goes around and around and around

510
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:21,100
Horn for days horn for days spit on that like a top

511
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:24,060
Um chancey

512
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:28,460
You know what? I've always been a chancey fan. Uh, she's a smash for me

513
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:35,420
I was gonna it's just like would you take her egg and pop that sucker in like who's gonna give you the egg if you're sad

514
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:43,660
So like if you're in a sexy situation with a chancey that thing's going probably up one of the holes

515
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:50,940
And it like dissolves and it's like all glittery and then you just feel better and really happy because like

516
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:54,380
That's that's what she does. She hunts you down

517
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:58,380
And gives you your her egg

518
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:01,420
I think

519
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:06,220
I think I would sit I would eat her and I think I'll sit in the cockshare for that one

520
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:09,100
Okay, because I want to see how that works out

521
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:16,620
So past it would be a sweet it would be a sweet urethane. That's what yeah, that's what and I you know, I'm I kind of want to watch

522
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:18,380
um

523
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:22,220
But it's like it's funny because I'm on the fence if there was like a maybe I would give a maybe

524
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:24,940
Like I have to be in a the right headspace

525
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:26,700
uh

526
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:28,700
Tangela tangela I can never pronounce

527
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,500
Tangela tanga see I can't

528
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:34,300
It's okay. It's

529
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:35,820
tangela here

530
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:37,820
Why she's a lady

531
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:45,420
She's got that beautiful hair. Yeah, what's the consistency of uh, it's little

532
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:48,380
Are they like tentacles?

533
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:50,540
Or she's like a bush

534
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:52,540
I'm gonna say they're like tentacles

535
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:54,220
Okay

536
00:45:54,220 --> 00:46:01,020
And I always like imagine they're like a jelly sort of consistency. Yeah, like wishy. Yeah, because I'm like then yes

537
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:03,660
I'm a fan of tentacles

538
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:05,500
uh

539
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,500
People are saying vines

540
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:14,060
Are they vines? I don't know. I don't know is tank what way I know she's a plant

541
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:16,940
Hold on

Is tangela I can I'll answer this with a quick google search grass type. It goes our vines. Yeah

543
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:30,700
I mean, I don't want vines up my Muppet Muppetissie, you know, but there's but there's no leaves

544
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:32,940
So they're like perfectly smooth

545
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:35,100
Uh true

546
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:38,460
I'll give it a chance. I'll give it a chance

547
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:41,500
You'll give them a chance because you like them a lot

548
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:47,020
Uh kengish con

00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:54,380

551
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:07,340
She's making money for her baby. Yeah, I work hard for the money like that's her

552
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:10,220
That's her. Yeah smash

00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:15,260
Smash and then you know, I'll take responsibility. I'll help raise this child with her

554
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:19,740
You would have such a wholesome family life together. I believe

555
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:23,900
You're not the stepdad. You're the dad that stepped up. Yeah

556
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:27,740
That's such a good fucking line

557
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:33,100
Uh the mega version where the kid

558
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:35,820
is just out of the

559
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:37,260
pouch

560
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:39,740
You give that kid 20 to go to the movies

561
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:45,340
Oh, yeah, it's me and your mom. We're gonna hang out go hang out with your friends

562
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:49,820
I'm good. Don't come home for like at least three hours. Yeah, don't

563
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:52,620
possibly four if we're

564
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:55,260
We're up. We're trying new things. Um

565
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:59,980
We're playing new games. Don't worry about it kiddo. Here's some here's some pizza money

566
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,460
Go to the arcade

567
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:06,940
And then you're you're just you're just in the bedroom you're playing smash on switch

568
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:10,780
We just didn't want the kid to interrupt

569
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:14,300
Uh

570
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:16,300
Horses for the male gaze

571
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:19,100
However, remember that one toy

572
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:24,300
This the sucker toy does this because can horsey also suck

573
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:27,980
Yeah, because I feel like it would be like one of those little

574
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:37,100
Like a little as long vibrator toy like a rose as long as it has like an any and any option and not

575
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:40,860
Like an outie only option with just the bubbles

576
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:45,740
Because like the last thing you want to do it is blow in

577
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:49,340
Yeah

578
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:53,180
Like I wouldn't I would just it would primarily be used for down there

579
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:55,180
Yeah

580
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:58,780
Or nipples or yeah or nipple. Yeah a little bit of

581
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:01,980
Muppet nipple

582
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:05,500
Felt up if you know what I mean

583
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:12,620
Oh, I get it because of the material. Yeah, you got it. I got it. I'm so smart

584
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:16,540
Um, so I will say

585
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:18,540
smash for horsey

586
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:21,980
I'm I'm also gonna have to go with smash for this one. Okay

587
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:24,620
But again, if I was a man, then I would

588
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:30,300
This would be a no brainer. That's a hole every hole's a goal if I was every hole's the goal

589
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:32,780
Even even coffings

590
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,500
Um

591
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:41,580
For cedra though, I feel like it wouldn't be as good

592
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:44,780
Because so many harsh edges

593
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:49,020
Too sharp. Yeah, I don't feel like I would be able to get a good grip

594
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:51,980
Well, you could definitely get a good grip

595
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:56,460
But I feel like once you were done and like you were in bed not cuttable. Yeah

596
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,500
You roll over that thing you're impaled

597
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:00,860
Yeah

598
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:06,620
And not like in the good way obviously sliced up on like sandpaper like scales or something

599
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:10,620
Yeah, too aggressive. I'm gonna say pass

600
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:13,340
Pass sorry cedra

601
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:14,860
Goldeen

602
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:19,260
That's a no brainer right there. That's for everybody. That's for everybody

603
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:21,900
It's got two e's for everyone

604
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:24,060
I

605
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:29,980
Ready to eat you for everyone. I mean so good they put it in twice

606
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:35,500
All right, we are fucking the goldfish smash

607
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:40,380
How see king I don't like the teeth. No, no pass

608
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:49,660
Pass down. It's a downgrade. Yeah, be careful. Be careful who you call cute in high school. They might just never glow down

609
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:52,060
I

610
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:54,300
star

611
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:58,300
I mean

612
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:00,300
I'm robbing it. Yeah

613
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:03,820
I would definitely rob this thing. Um

614
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:07,740
I'm like wondering if

615
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:13,740
You could like put little things on each of its little hands

616
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:17,820
They use it as like a multi-use toy

617
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:20,640
You definitely could

618
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:24,620
Yeah, but like it would just be

619
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:27,820
But then again, it's a fucking starfish

620
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:36,060
Like at that point you might as well just get yourself something fake and not a living creature. Yeah, exactly. That's why I'm thinking like

621
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:40,140
It's a pass. Yeah, I'm gonna pass

622
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:47,180
Sorry star you star me same thing. I'm robbing it robin robin. You're robbing it. Oh by the way if you're new here

00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:59,660
Oh, and I want to go back and like watch some of her old videos after this

654
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:01,980
I'll save

655
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:03,980
All right, mr. Mime

656
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:09,180
Okay, so I have very complex emotions about mr. Mime. Please elaborate

657
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:16,140
Okay, so there's a comic that's on tumblr where they talk about the logistics of eating mr. Mime

658
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:18,540
And that has been with me for years

659
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:22,780
Look, why do I feel like I've heard this before? Oh, yeah, ash's dad is the

660
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:24,860
also the

661
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:27,100
Also ash's dad. Yeah, I mean

662
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:33,740
I don't mind sharing with ash's mom because she's she herself seems like a bit of a freak who would share mr. Mime

663
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:35,740
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm

664
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:37,740
And also he is a definite smash

665
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:41,580
Um, I'm good

666
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:45,180
I feel like I feel like his fingers would be like sticky

667
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:50,700
I just think of mr. Mime from the live action pokemon movie and he was terrifying

668
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:55,100
I don't I don't I'm not I'm not envisioning real life pokemon

669
00:54:55,100 --> 00:55:00,780
I'm envisioning cute 2d once because we're too. I know 2d muppet girls. I'm just I'm just

670
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:06,140
I'm just uh traumatized from live action mr. Mime

671
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:15,420
And also uh like clefable or clefairy, whichever one it was. No, it was jigglypuff. Those things were freaking terrifying for that movie

672
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:21,660
Everything in that movie was freaking terrifying. It really was uh clowns sometimes scare me as well. So

673
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:23,660
Aw

674
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:25,660
Not even actually it's like they

675
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:29,100
They're unnerving. I just think of john wane gasey

676
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:31,900
Oh

677
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:34,700
I feel like I feel like mr. Mime would gasey some

678
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:38,460
Some in uh innocence. So

679
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:42,380
Man

680
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:47,020
I'm not I'm not that caught up on my true crime. I wish I knew more about I never

681
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:49,660
Please don't

682
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:51,500
It's bad

683
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:54,140
Fair enough. Um, I'm gonna pass

684
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:59,900
Like what's your opinion on people who actually have it for the new it clown and not the old it clown

685
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:02,460
That's so funny to me because like I

686
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:05,740
I've seen it like I like understand it

687
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:08,940
Again, sometimes when I'm really scared of something

688
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:14,780
I'll sexualize it. So I'm just like I'm gonna trick myself into being horny for it

689
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:19,420
And so I did do that with pennywise at some point and so now I'm not scared of pennywise

690
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:27,500
That's fair, but I mean, how could you not look at that clown and think damn that head that head is totally okoteer

691
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:31,580
I could sell ad space on that clown's head

692
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:34,620
Make a million dollars

693
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:37,740
I'm just terrifying

694
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:43,420
Innocent children. They're just like, what's this weird ad placement on this head? Now. I want to buy a box of pop-tarts crazy

695
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:49,020
Um, yeah, joes. Where where's the address? Oh, there it is. It's right underneath the advertisement

696
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:51,820
Oh

697
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:55,340
Seven head um

698
00:56:56,540 --> 00:57:00,860
Okay, what about the the galar version? I'm robbing it

699
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:07,100
I mean, he looks so fashionable. Look at that drip. He's iced out

700
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:10,380
He's got his yee yees on

701
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:13,260
He's on

702
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:19,740
I'm gonna pass. I kind of he's just so he's just cute

703
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:25,420
Yeah, I like his little shoes. I just want to rob him and just be like go on your way

704
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:28,780
Like you're gonna steal his shoes. Yeah

705
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:35,740
I I feel like I'm obligated to smash if you're just gonna take his shoes. I'm gonna take his shoes in the jam on his chest

706
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:40,700
All right, then it'll it'll be a smash and grab. You smash. Yeah, smash and grab

707
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:45,260
By the way, we do a smash pass eat and rob

708
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:49,740
By the way for ours, uh smash passes for these pokemon

709
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:52,620
So sometimes people decide to eat these like because I would definitely eat him too

710
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:55,580
He looks like he would taste like ice cream

711
00:57:56,060 --> 00:58:00,860
He looks really sweet like a blueberry taste good like blue raspberry icy

712
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:04,380
Very I'm also eating him now

713
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:08,460
That's fair. My cat's food is going off

714
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:12,780
That's okay. Sorry

715
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:15,500
Well, they gotta eat they do

716
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:20,540
I just have to announce it every time so people don't think there's like gunfire in the background

717
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:26,540
But fireworks are still existent. That's true

718
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:30,940
Oh, yeah, the fireworks will be on

719
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:33,980
The 13th for me. So I can't wait to be fighting

720
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:36,860
In the trenches when that happens

721
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,700
Oh my god

722
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:40,700
My heart goes out to you

723
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:44,060
My cats do not have a good time. Um

724
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:47,100
cypher

725
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:49,020
Okay, but

726
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:51,980
He he kind of he kind of hot. I was gonna say smash

727
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:54,700
Yeah, a little bit of knife play

728
00:58:55,500 --> 00:59:00,860
Yeah, put hold hold those little danger hands up to your throat and go at it

729
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:03,100
Yeah

730
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:06,620
If precisely smash

731
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:09,180
Everyone's everyone's just like, yeah

732
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:12,220
There's some loud eaters. Can you hear them eating?

733
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:16,700
I mean kind of jealous. I don't think so

734
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:20,300
They do much very loudly my cats

735
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:22,300
Uh jigs

736
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:24,780
Uh smash

737
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:28,700
Jeans herself is a queen so I don't

738
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:34,140
I'll yeah, I don't know she has them perfect if I was a dude

739
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:37,180
She is perfect blowjob lips

740
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:42,300
Not only that she's got canonical titties. Yeah, she literally

741
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:45,740
I wonder what she looks like

742
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:51,580
Like what's her body type under that like what are her legs look like I wonder

743
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:54,780
Probably cute, right

744
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:58,380
Like like maybe like she's a little chubby chubby guy

745
00:59:58,780 --> 01:00:00,780
Little chubby lady. Maybe

746
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:08,220
And and like not only that like her wig is on point. She is she it's it's there snatch

747
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:11,260
The lace is laid. Yeah

748
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:19,900
Yeah, the original this was just a lovely little uh

749
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:25,180
African uh

750
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:35,980
No, you're right, but like mr. Popo was like the same way so we can't really be mad at it because we like dragon balls

751
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:36,460
E

752
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:39,820
Yeah, mr. Popo never changed nothing

753
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:45,820
I ain't made mr. Popo purple. Yeah, Mr. Popo stayed black

754
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:51,020
He was black

755
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:56,780
I'm not gonna lie. I do love mr. Popo and dragon balls either you bridged. Oh, yeah

756
01:00:57,500 --> 01:01:00,940
I have to watch it again. I don't remember what the

757
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:07,900
This uh voices were because I remember cracking up. I used to watch that in young justice abridged. Oh my god

758
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:15,740
Oh, I might recommend watching a sword art online the abridged as well. Oh my god. I'm so watching

759
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:22,460
Says it made me actually like sword art online because I did not like sword. I don't like sword art online

760
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:25,820
And this will make you like it. Okay, perfect

761
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:30,300
Wasn't jinx based on a japanese mountain yokai with black skin and large lips?

762
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:35,020
Yes, probably a hundred percent because all the pokemon are based off of like yokai

763
01:01:35,820 --> 01:01:37,180
and

764
01:01:37,180 --> 01:01:41,020
animals and animals and just like japanese demons and stuff

765
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:45,340
And uh mystical creatures so a hundred percent. That's definitely it

766
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:48,300
But it just it just looks funny

767
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:50,300
Hahaha

768
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:53,660
Electabuzz

769
01:01:56,380 --> 01:02:01,980
Do you think he could do that? I think he can I think he can localize his his electrical flow

770
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:05,660
I just don't like his face

771
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:10,060
You know what I've always wondered is he like a tiger? I don't know

772
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:15,820
I generally don't know because I can't like he has like fuzzy arms

773
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:21,260
But the rest of him isn't fuzzy and I don't think he's a bee. No

774
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:25,580
Yeah, but he's like

775
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:27,820
he's like a

776
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:30,060
Bee dinosaur tiger

777
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:35,260
I'm I'm still a smash though. Yeah

778
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:39,420
Because he's got handlebars on his head. He does

779
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:47,100
Maybe he's got really soft-looking arms like really powerful arms as long as his teeth

780
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:53,260
Don't nip at me and actually no, you know, never mind. I don't mind a little bit, but you know, I just said for

781
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:56,300
Scyther

782
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:58,300
So I I'm not I'm not scared

783
01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:01,100
Um, so yeah, I guess I'll smash

784
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:04,300
Yeah, definitely a definite smash there. Yeah

785
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:07,420
He's a mix of an oni and a tiger. Oh

786
01:03:07,820 --> 01:03:13,500
Oh, okay. See that makes sense. That makes sense to me. I get it now. Uh booty cheek head

787
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:17,180
Pass pass

788
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:20,940
He's just always gonna have that stupid look on his face

789
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:23,740
pincer

790
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:32,460
That's a pass for me. Yeah, I'm I always think of fucking earwigs when I look at a pincer and I hate those bugs

791
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:36,540
Now if you had said like hair across we are not there yet

792
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:39,580
But we're

793
01:03:41,180 --> 01:03:43,580
Pincer mega no same thing. No, no

794
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:51,500
Magmar is good for hot talking. I'm not a dude. So again, I have a penis envy for some of these pokemon

795
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:54,140
Yeah, so I can't use them in the same way

796
01:03:56,380 --> 01:03:58,380
Uh toros

797
01:03:58,620 --> 01:04:00,620
um

798
01:04:01,180 --> 01:04:03,180
This one's hard. I'd probably die

799
01:04:04,060 --> 01:04:05,900
Because that's just a bull

800
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:09,900
It is but if I'm a pup I'm a muppet then I could probably take it

801
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:17,340
Yeah, definitely because like that's how they that's how they breed the cows. Yeah

802
01:04:20,140 --> 01:04:25,420
You know what I'm gonna say smash, you know, I'll I will too. I'm curious. Yeah

803
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:27,420
Yeah

804
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:35,500
Take the bull by the horns you got it

805
01:04:36,860 --> 01:04:44,220
Agmar is good for hiding stuff. There's a scene where magmaru hands you a nice toasty pokeball he retrieved from somewhere warm

806
01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:49,100
Oh god, he folded out his ass. Uh magic heart

807
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:54,780
Smash

808
01:04:54,860 --> 01:04:56,300
Magic heart

809
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:58,300
Yeah, why?

810
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:03,740
Okay, so like it's gonna sound really weird, right? Okay, but

811
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:10,940
First of all, he's really hard and rigid and you can't eat him because they've already confirmed that in the anime

812
01:05:11,260 --> 01:05:16,140
But like he does the only thing he does is splash which means he's gonna be moving

813
01:05:17,260 --> 01:05:23,580
And like his mouth is the perfect size to like latch on to you like one of those said toys. Okay

814
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:26,540
I feel like with the splash though

815
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:29,260
It'd be just too much wetness

816
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:32,300
Like it would be uncomfortable

817
01:05:33,020 --> 01:05:37,580
Nah, it'd be fine. It'd be fine. Definitely would have to lay a tarp down

818
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:43,500
Well, yeah, but like none of these are gonna be clean. It's pokemon. That's a good point

819
01:05:44,780 --> 01:05:50,620
I'm gonna pass because I wouldn't be able to keep a straight face having that thing latched on to my

820
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:58,540
Muppet that's part of the experience. You gotta you gotta bully the fish. So he gets the anger so he can become the next one

821
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:04,940
Because we all know that the next one is what we all want

822
01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:14,220
I'm terrified. No, I'm not

823
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:17,260
I can't

824
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:19,100
You really?

825
01:06:19,180 --> 01:06:21,020
I don't know

826
01:06:21,020 --> 01:06:24,220
I mean, it might be too big. I don't think I could handle it

827
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:30,540
You could take it. You could take it. You can definitely take it. I'll try. I'll take it. I'll smash

828
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:36,380
Yeah, it garrados is like a smash and even then you don't even have to be on the underside

829
01:06:36,380 --> 01:06:40,780
You could be on top because like he doesn't need anything. Yeah

830
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:49,020
I'm sure it's like the same logic of salmon spawning where like you like your eggs and he comes and he fertilizes

831
01:06:49,260 --> 01:06:55,740
And you just go on about your business. But this time you're just on the back riding. That's a good point. Okay

832
01:06:56,940 --> 01:06:59,420
This one's too much though. That one's a lot too much

833
01:07:00,940 --> 01:07:04,220
It's very goofy. It looks like they just smack the head onto like a smaller fish

834
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:07,340
Every time I see this one

835
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:12,460
It's a pass uh lapras smash smash. Look at that fucking face

836
01:07:13,180 --> 01:07:15,020
She's so pretty

837
01:07:15,020 --> 01:07:16,300
So pretty

838
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:18,540
The little seductive gays. Are you kidding me?

839
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:23,820
Easy smash and she she just looks caring. I'll put on a strap for her

840
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:26,860
Well, she looks at me while I hit it from behind

841
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:30,220
I'd be under the water for her. I'd take it. Yeah

842
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:32,700
Yeah, yeah

843
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:34,220
smash

844
01:07:34,220 --> 01:07:36,220
Yeah

845
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:42,300
Giganta max I thought there was a cruise ship on her back for a second. Um

846
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:48,060
That's just a giant version. Yeah, you'll risk it for the biscuit. I can't it's too big

847
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:51,340
I'll be crushed. My muppet body would be

848
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:54,540
Destroyed

849
01:07:54,540 --> 01:07:57,820
You know, I I have I have no qualms

850
01:07:58,940 --> 01:08:05,180
Against uh, this this lovely lady letting me be under her flippers. Okay. All right

851
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:09,100
Moving forward ditto

852
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:12,300
Smash smash. Obviously ditto is always an obvious smash

853
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:19,020
Yeah, obviously like ditto can be your wildest dreams or your blandest. Yeah, exactly

854
01:08:19,660 --> 01:08:24,700
Depending on how safe you want to be. Yeah, you can go really vanilla. You can get really dark with it

855
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:27,260
Ditto's there for you

856
01:08:27,260 --> 01:08:30,060
Yeah, you know, you know, just ditto man ditto

857
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:32,620
God, now I'm thinking about the pokemon

858
01:08:33,580 --> 01:08:38,860
Movie like the detective pikachu one. We just find out like the guys that have been like with the guy

859
01:08:40,060 --> 01:08:42,060
We're just dittos. Yeah

860
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:44,060
I

861
01:08:47,980 --> 01:08:49,980
Evie

862
01:08:54,860 --> 01:09:01,100
I'm gonna say pass for evie. Yeah, it's a it's a baby. You gotta get to the evolutions. Yeah

863
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:05,580
That one's like a fluffy one. It's very cute

864
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:09,580
Big boy. I want to pet its fluff, but I wouldn't

865
01:09:10,540 --> 01:09:12,540
I wouldn't do that

866
01:09:12,540 --> 01:09:14,540
It looks mischievous too

867
01:09:14,860 --> 01:09:16,860
Like he knows he knows what he's doing

868
01:09:19,340 --> 01:09:24,540
Uh, vaporeon is an obvious smash for me because we all know vaporeon is the most breedable pokemon of all the uh

869
01:09:25,260 --> 01:09:30,940
All the evolutions so of course the most compatible with the human physiology both man and woman. Yeah

870
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:33,820
So that's a smash

871
01:09:34,780 --> 01:09:36,780
I

872
01:09:36,860 --> 01:09:38,860
Uh jolteon

873
01:09:38,860 --> 01:09:42,540
Honestly, I've never been that fan much of a fan of jolteon

874
01:09:43,740 --> 01:09:49,660
I like jolteon, but not like that. I always thought jolteon was like I I remember I have to have a jolteon on my team

875
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:52,460
When I would play but not not like that

876
01:09:53,420 --> 01:09:58,380
I would chew on a jolteon toy growing up because it was made out of that good rubber. Ooh

877
01:09:59,260 --> 01:10:01,260
That good rubber that good good

878
01:10:02,220 --> 01:10:05,260
But but it's but it's a pass. Yeah, I'll pass

879
01:10:06,220 --> 01:10:07,660
flaryon

880
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:09,660
pet smash smash. Yeah

881
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:11,740
smash

882
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:13,740
I'm passing on flaryon

883
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:19,100
That's fine, but like he's so fluffy. He's fluffy. I just pet him

884
01:10:20,380 --> 01:10:23,340
That was a little fluffy boy. It's one of touches little little feets

885
01:10:24,140 --> 01:10:27,900
I feel that but like I I see a personal bed warmer

886
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:32,060
It's never cold. That's very true, but what if you get too hot?

887
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:35,100
I can always take the blankets off. Okay

888
01:10:37,020 --> 01:10:39,020
Can we even feel heat as puppets?

889
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:41,660
Yeah

890
01:10:41,660 --> 01:10:43,660
When we get too hot we're on fire

891
01:10:47,740 --> 01:10:50,380
I look over and look at the poory gone just like here

892
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:53,100
right after the evolutions

893
01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:56,380
That always cracks me up

894
01:10:56,620 --> 01:11:00,220
So not this poory gone, but definitely the poory gone too

895
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:03,260
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna pass on this one

896
01:11:03,820 --> 01:11:05,820
uh

897
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:07,580
Omenite

898
01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:14,140
That's a smash. It's a smash. I've always thought omenite was really cute. It looks like a little mustachioed man

899
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:17,820
Right. He's so cute. He's so cute

900
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:21,260
I love him. I would probably eat him as well

901
01:11:21,260 --> 01:11:23,260
Oh

902
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:30,380
I remember lord helix. So like were you familiar with twitch plays pokemon like four million years ago?

903
01:11:31,260 --> 01:11:32,140
No

904
01:11:32,140 --> 01:11:36,220
Explain, so what what it was is on twitch. There was a stream

905
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:42,220
Where twitch chat was playing pokemon one line at a time basically one chat line at a time

906
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:44,700
Oh my god

907
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:47,420
They beat the game and like one of them was

908
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:50,620
A helix because they had the helix fossil

909
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:55,900
It was it was absolutely amazing. That is pretty sick

910
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:01,100
Uh almost star

911
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:05,580
No, I don't like the I'm I like tentacles, but I don't like the beak

912
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:13,020
I don't like the beak. I don't like the shell the eyes freak me out. Yeah, and I'm I'm okay with that

913
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:15,580
I'm I'm that's a no. Thank you

914
01:12:18,620 --> 01:12:20,620
Uh

915
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:22,540
Kabuto

916
01:12:22,540 --> 01:12:26,860
I've never liked him neither have I I also just think of kabuto from naruto. So

917
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:30,540
There was a guy in naruto named kabuto

918
01:12:31,740 --> 01:12:34,940
Was there or was it something else? I'm pretty sure there was

919
01:12:36,140 --> 01:12:38,140
Hell if I know chat helped

920
01:12:39,340 --> 01:12:42,060
I don't yes. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Thank you

921
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:47,100
And it's funny because he pushes up his glasses and his eyes look like that

922
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:50,540
So I always I always think it's funny

923
01:12:51,820 --> 01:12:53,580
Yeah, the white haired guy

924
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:55,580
I always I thought he was cute

925
01:12:55,660 --> 01:12:58,300
Because I like his little glasses and his glasses would glint

926
01:12:59,180 --> 01:13:04,060
I got you. He's doable from naruto though. Yeah, I agree with that statement. Um

927
01:13:05,420 --> 01:13:07,420
Pass kabutops

928
01:13:08,060 --> 01:13:10,060
That's a smash

929
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:11,980
Uh

930
01:13:11,980 --> 01:13:13,980
I don't want to be topped by kabutops

931
01:13:14,940 --> 01:13:17,340
Uh, I feel like we would

932
01:13:18,620 --> 01:13:20,620
I just don't think we're compatible

933
01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:22,620
with my with my dom

934
01:13:23,180 --> 01:13:24,380
You know

935
01:13:24,380 --> 01:13:27,980
I don't know. I think he might take a pigging if he was just fim dom him hard enough

936
01:13:28,060 --> 01:13:31,100
You know just girl boss harder. This girl boss harder

937
01:13:31,660 --> 01:13:38,060
Just girl boss harder because like he's basically scyther. Yeah, no wings. No wings. That's that's a good point

938
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:41,420
Ah

939
01:13:41,580 --> 01:13:43,740
And plus like if you just chain his little like

940
01:13:44,380 --> 01:13:50,380
Scythe sysicles like in front of him then like all he's got to do is move his back back legs

941
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:56,540
All right, and then yeah, yeah, you have that you have that action pump action going on

942
01:14:00,220 --> 01:14:05,980
Just gonna hog tie up this kabutops this kabutops is getting topped. All right, I'll smash

943
01:14:06,940 --> 01:14:08,940
Yeah

944
01:14:09,340 --> 01:14:11,340
Rip you in half from a hug

945
01:14:11,420 --> 01:14:13,260
aerodactyl

946
01:14:13,260 --> 01:14:17,340
Okay, this one actually pisses me the fuck off. I hate its face so much

947
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:19,580
I hate him

948
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:24,780
But like not just because of the way he looks that episode of pokemon pissed me the fuck off

949
01:14:25,180 --> 01:14:32,300
Where ash gets like abducted by the aerodactyl and he tries to tell people. Yeah, that was me and nobody fucking believes him

950
01:14:33,180 --> 01:14:35,180
This motherfucker

951
01:14:36,380 --> 01:14:41,580
Like no one will believe you get abducted by an aerodactyl because look how goofy that thing looks

952
01:14:42,220 --> 01:14:49,420
But then again, like nobody ever believes ash when he when he tries to count his adventures. I think he just gave up

953
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:52,540
That's very accurate. I think he just yeah

954
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:58,060
He just is like this came to terms that he's forever a child and no one will ever believe anything he ever says

955
01:14:58,300 --> 01:15:04,780
Like his very first adventure like he can't tell anyone that he was the kid who saved the world because of you two and mew

956
01:15:04,860 --> 01:15:06,860
Felt so fucking bad for him

957
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:09,500
Like throwing himself into like a pokemon battle

958
01:15:10,460 --> 01:15:14,540
And then like when they meet mew two again, it's like, oh, this is our second time eating

959
01:15:14,540 --> 01:15:17,260
It's like I have no memory of the first time. It's like

960
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:23,900
Oh my god

961
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:26,460
Sorry, I didn't mean to go off on a little rant there

962
01:15:26,460 --> 01:15:33,580
No, I love your little rant. It's perfect. I hate aerodactyl. I bet you'll hate aerodactyl mega even more

963
01:15:37,420 --> 01:15:41,260
He looks like a gross dude with a goatee that would like

964
01:15:42,140 --> 01:15:44,140
Have a weird van

965
01:15:44,140 --> 01:15:46,140
and always smell like piss

966
01:15:46,780 --> 01:15:52,380
He looks like that bad dragon from like, uh, what was that movie dragon heart?

967
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:55,020
Oh

968
01:15:55,020 --> 01:16:00,140
From dragon heart. I hate it. I thought you meant bad dragon and I like like in the toy and I was very confused

969
01:16:01,180 --> 01:16:05,260
Not a bad dragons are okay, but this one is a bad bad dragon. Oh my god

970
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:10,140
Yeah, the drag I haven't watched dragon heart in a long time. Holy crap. Everybody used to love that movie

971
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:17,020
Oh, I distinctly watching that distinctly remember my heart is well protected

972
01:16:22,380 --> 01:16:25,820
So pass, uh, snorlax smash smash

973
01:16:26,860 --> 01:16:27,740
smash

974
01:16:27,740 --> 01:16:29,740
You got the nice little

975
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:32,060
old chubby boy

976
01:16:32,060 --> 01:16:34,060
perfect for snuggling

977
01:16:35,260 --> 01:16:39,900
He is he's so good. He's like you're but he's your lazy fuck. Yeah

978
01:16:44,460 --> 01:16:46,460
Yes

979
01:16:46,620 --> 01:16:48,620
That's literally me

980
01:16:49,340 --> 01:16:51,660
Not eating this one now. I wouldn't eat snorlax

981
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:56,380
He's like totoro. Yeah. Oh, I want to smash totoro though

982
01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:00,380
I'll smash snorlax

983
01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:04,780
I mean, he's not totoro, but he's like totoro. He's like sexy totoro

984
01:17:06,940 --> 01:17:11,420
Sexy totoro. Yeah, look at his sexy gaze with his eyes half closed

985
01:17:12,220 --> 01:17:17,740
Look, it took this man over like 10 years to stand up. I'm not I'm not gonna say that he's not sexy

986
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:20,380
Yeah, and I can you can just ride him

987
01:17:21,340 --> 01:17:23,340
And just you know do whatever you want

988
01:17:24,220 --> 01:17:26,220
Of course. Yeah

989
01:17:26,220 --> 01:17:28,220
Yeah, smash. Yeah. Yeah

990
01:17:29,580 --> 01:17:31,580
Uh

991
01:17:32,380 --> 01:17:34,380
That's a tree. Where's his face?

992
01:17:35,980 --> 01:17:41,900
Where's the gigantic max? He's just gone. He's just he's laying down again. He's tired. He got up

993
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:44,700
When you when you smash the first time and he's like

994
01:17:45,660 --> 01:17:52,540
He's like just do do what you want pick an apple walk walk the bushes

995
01:17:55,180 --> 01:17:58,460
I'll definitely pick an apple. I'm so I'm eat. I guess I'll eat him

996
01:17:59,820 --> 01:18:04,300
You'll eat from him. Yeah, I'll eat the produce of his long eats

997
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:10,220
I don't know. I feel like it's still a smash. I feel all right to use. I feel like you could use his

998
01:18:11,660 --> 01:18:13,500
Snorlax

999
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:15,180
his his

1000
01:18:15,180 --> 01:18:20,060
What what am I thinking of Snorlax sack as like a beanbag chair sort of situation? No

1001
01:18:20,940 --> 01:18:22,940
Like it's sort of a micro

1002
01:18:23,020 --> 01:18:26,300
macro sort of situation. Yeah, it's very like giant

1003
01:18:27,740 --> 01:18:29,100
Giantess

1004
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:31,100
Yeah, except he

1005
01:18:31,180 --> 01:18:33,180
Except he's like the giant. Yeah

1006
01:18:34,780 --> 01:18:36,780
And it's more chill

1007
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:41,340
It is definitely a lot more chill and you could take a stroll in his gardens afterwards

1008
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:44,140
Yeah, air air yourself off

1009
01:18:45,260 --> 01:18:47,740
Air yourself off. You're just like a wet

1010
01:18:49,740 --> 01:18:51,740
Muppet yeah

1011
01:18:52,940 --> 01:18:55,740
He just here just like plop as every time you move

1012
01:18:58,060 --> 01:19:02,220
It's like just wet fabric as you're going up the sidewalk his treasure trail

1013
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:05,100
Oh my god

1014
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:08,140
I like how he does like have a happy trail technically

1015
01:19:08,220 --> 01:19:10,220
See

1016
01:19:11,020 --> 01:19:14,060
If he wasn't they knew what they were doing when they designed them

1017
01:19:16,620 --> 01:19:19,180
I'm still gonna pass I'm gonna smash

1018
01:19:19,660 --> 01:19:21,580
Okay

1019
01:19:21,580 --> 01:19:27,500
This is a bird. This is a bird. I'm eating it. I'm eating past the bird pass

1020
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:30,700
However

1021
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:33,100
This one

1022
01:19:33,260 --> 01:19:34,380
Like

1023
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:40,700
Don't get me wrong. I'm sure regular articuno is like the equivalent of eating cold fried chicken, which is delicious

1024
01:19:41,580 --> 01:19:48,860
But this one this one's more smashable because of like that's just the just the that's the cunty energy that it's the aura

1025
01:19:49,420 --> 01:19:51,900
He's serving a very tuxedo mask

1026
01:19:53,660 --> 01:19:55,660
I'm gonna yeah, I'll smash I'll smash this bird

1027
01:19:56,460 --> 01:20:03,260
Like if it if articuno galer was like a bunny, this is what harlott's final form would probably have

1028
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:05,660
Oh my god, you're so great actually

1029
01:20:06,220 --> 01:20:08,220
That would be so true

1030
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:10,220
They do have the same air of it as a harlot

1031
01:20:10,940 --> 01:20:12,460
um

1032
01:20:12,460 --> 01:20:14,380
Zaptos

1033
01:20:14,380 --> 01:20:17,980
Look at those drumsticks good for dipping and mashed potatoes

1034
01:20:19,180 --> 01:20:21,180
I'm having that with honey mustard

1035
01:20:21,180 --> 01:20:23,020
Eating this. Oh, yeah

1036
01:20:23,020 --> 01:20:25,340
Passing and eating passing and eating

1037
01:20:26,060 --> 01:20:29,260
Okay, but zaptos galer

1038
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:31,900
Hello

1039
01:20:32,380 --> 01:20:36,300
These thickums I still want to eat him. He looks like spicy chicken

1040
01:20:37,180 --> 01:20:44,060
I think I'd smash him. Yeah, the the spice would be fun to deal with but probably would hurt a little bit. Yeah

1041
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:48,060
Do you would it be spicy when you copulate?

1042
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:51,900
God, what if it is

1043
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:55,660
I just feel like I would just be burned like that's why it's hard for me

1044
01:20:56,620 --> 01:21:01,660
To think that way about fire type pokemon because i'm like I feel like they're just too warm

1045
01:21:02,860 --> 01:21:04,060
Sometimes

1046
01:21:04,060 --> 01:21:09,740
I think I would burn myself and it's a little cloaca. I'm sure if you use like protection it would be fine

1047
01:21:10,540 --> 01:21:12,540
spicy turkey

1048
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:16,700
He gained seasoning um

1049
01:21:17,900 --> 01:21:19,900
I'll eat him

1050
01:21:20,620 --> 01:21:22,220
All right

1051
01:21:22,220 --> 01:21:25,580
Moltres, uh again spicy chicken. I'll eat that

1052
01:21:26,620 --> 01:21:30,780
I never liked Moltres. He was always ugly. Yeah, I never liked Moltres either

1053
01:21:31,660 --> 01:21:33,660
However

1054
01:21:34,700 --> 01:21:36,700
The glare version

1055
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:46,300
He's very pretty very pretty but he kind of looks like a dick

1056
01:21:46,540 --> 01:21:51,740
Yeah, like he's got ass hole vibes. Yeah, he's fuck boy energy

1057
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:53,660
He does

1058
01:21:53,660 --> 01:21:55,820
I'm gonna pass but he's pretty to look at

1059
01:21:56,540 --> 01:21:59,900
He is I I keep him in a gilded cage. Yes

1060
01:22:01,420 --> 01:22:04,620
We'll steal him. We're robbing him like his actual self

1061
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:07,340
Yeah

1062
01:22:07,340 --> 01:22:09,340
Uh dratini

1063
01:22:10,460 --> 01:22:11,340
So

1064
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:14,700
Dratini's are really cute. That's what these are so cute

1065
01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:17,420
That's a worm

1066
01:22:17,820 --> 01:22:20,380
That's a little guy. It's a little worm guy

1067
01:22:21,580 --> 01:22:23,180
I'm gonna pass

1068
01:22:23,180 --> 01:22:25,180
I'm passing

1069
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:30,540
Don't you dare leave him alone. We're passing everybody. Relax dragon air

1070
01:22:31,340 --> 01:22:33,340
That's a smash. That's a smash

1071
01:22:33,980 --> 01:22:37,980
Dragon air has always been a beautiful lady. Oh, yeah, I I remember

1072
01:22:39,260 --> 01:22:42,060
being young playing pokemon

1073
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:44,540
And just

1074
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:49,180
Intensely looking at dragon air and wanting a dragon air so bad

1075
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:54,540
Because like not only does it have like three gems that you can touch

1076
01:22:55,420 --> 01:23:02,460
Together, right? It's got beautiful winged ears beautiful and it's just long and smooth. Yeah

1077
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:07,660
Everything I feel like it'll be really good for snuggling like you can just like coil up with it

1078
01:23:08,380 --> 01:23:13,900
Mm-hmm, and then yeah, I bet like the tail is very prehensile prehensile and it can control it pretty well

1079
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:15,900
So it just like pump in and out

1080
01:23:16,060 --> 01:23:17,100
Yeah

1081
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:21,900
Yeah, I'm I'm really feeling dragon air 100 percent always. Yep

1082
01:23:23,580 --> 01:23:26,780
Dragonite dragonite. We gotta have words, buddy. I don't

1083
01:23:27,740 --> 01:23:29,500
What happened?

1084
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:35,660
What happened man? You had two you you were winning you were winning two. I feel like I got catfish

1085
01:23:35,900 --> 01:23:37,900
like

1086
01:23:38,460 --> 01:23:41,660
Why why does he turn orange? I never got that

1087
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:47,020
Why is he not like a beautiful blue dragon?

1088
01:23:47,980 --> 01:23:50,300
I know it bothers me like a like a nice

1089
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:53,340
almost like almost like Gyarados

1090
01:23:54,060 --> 01:23:55,660
type dragon

1091
01:23:55,660 --> 01:23:57,660
But a lot smoother and like winged

1092
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:03,340
Like there there should be an alternate reality where dragonite looks more like it's dragon air self

1093
01:24:03,740 --> 01:24:10,460
Yeah, like I don't care how they do it put it put dragonite in another like

1094
01:24:12,300 --> 01:24:17,420
Like a country like galare and give him an alternate form make him blue

1095
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:19,340
make him

1096
01:24:19,340 --> 01:24:25,580
Like beautiful because he deserves to be beautiful instead of a Barney look at motherfucker

1097
01:24:26,780 --> 01:24:31,100
I would give him a hug though. I would I would hug him. He's cute, but annoying

1098
01:24:32,060 --> 01:24:33,740
pass

1099
01:24:33,740 --> 01:24:35,740
Mewtwo

1100
01:24:36,060 --> 01:24:38,060
Mewtwo looks like a lush vibrator

1101
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:43,260
Honestly, he do he look like he look like a lush three

1102
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:47,900
Like he's he's strapped in he's ready for you

1103
01:24:50,940 --> 01:24:52,940
Oh, that makes a lot of sense

1104
01:24:53,020 --> 01:24:55,020
So do you see the comment in the chat?

1105
01:24:55,420 --> 01:24:59,580
Oh, which one there's a theory that dragonite and Gyarados got swapped during development

1106
01:24:59,580 --> 01:25:04,620
Gyarados would have been dragon airs evolution the blue dragon dragonite would have been magic harps evolution

1107
01:25:05,660 --> 01:25:07,660
The color scheme makes sense

1108
01:25:08,540 --> 01:25:10,540
Yeah, I don't like it though. Yeah

1109
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:12,620
I don't like it

1110
01:25:12,620 --> 01:25:15,660
Love sense looking motherfucker. Yeah, I would smash Mewtwo

1111
01:25:17,420 --> 01:25:19,260
I would too

1112
01:25:19,260 --> 01:25:23,020
He's skilled with his hands too. Yeah, and he's a psychic type so

1113
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:26,300
Really put my brain to work

1114
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:30,780
Um, it's called a dragonite a Barney look at it

1115
01:25:32,940 --> 01:25:38,140
They should have done better. They should have done better all those years ago and we wouldn't have called him a Barney looking motherfucker

1116
01:25:39,820 --> 01:25:42,380
Mew or Mewtwo in terms of like power

1117
01:25:42,940 --> 01:25:44,700
I'll be

1118
01:25:44,700 --> 01:25:46,700
Isn't that Mew? Yeah, Mew

1119
01:25:47,420 --> 01:25:50,700
Because Mew is older than Mewtwo. Mewtwo's a baby. Yeah

1120
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:53,820
Mewtwo mega

1121
01:25:53,820 --> 01:25:55,820
I always like the design of this but I don't

1122
01:25:57,260 --> 01:25:59,100
Like it

1123
01:25:59,100 --> 01:26:01,100
Like that I

1124
01:26:02,300 --> 01:26:05,660
I don't know. It's a little weird for me. Yeah

1125
01:26:13,020 --> 01:26:16,060
Okay pass um mega x

1126
01:26:18,140 --> 01:26:22,700
I mean it's just a smaller tail and like more broader shoulders and arms

1127
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:27,180
He looked like he stand on business though. Like he can really plant himself

1128
01:26:29,900 --> 01:26:31,900
Really really mating press

1129
01:26:33,580 --> 01:26:38,140
Just really get in there. Yeah. Yeah, you know, I'll I'll say

1130
01:26:39,260 --> 01:26:41,260
Yeah

1131
01:26:41,820 --> 01:26:43,660
I'll smash

1132
01:26:43,660 --> 01:26:45,260
You know what?

1133
01:26:45,260 --> 01:26:48,780
If I could see him from behind because I'm sure he's got a like a big back porch

1134
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:51,500
I'm gonna say yeah. Yeah, okay

1135
01:26:52,460 --> 01:26:53,980
Smash

1136
01:26:53,980 --> 01:26:55,100
Smash

1137
01:26:55,100 --> 01:26:57,100
Um Mew

1138
01:26:57,100 --> 01:27:01,740
This is a mouse. You're a smash Mew. Yeah, I'm a smash Mew. Also

1139
01:27:02,780 --> 01:27:08,380
Also, I figured Mew was always a cat. That's why it was Mew. Oh, that's a good point

1140
01:27:13,020 --> 01:27:18,300
It just looks like a mouse to me Mew is another of all pokemon forms aside

1141
01:27:21,580 --> 01:27:23,580
Good point

1142
01:27:24,140 --> 01:27:26,140
Besides like

1143
01:27:26,380 --> 01:27:28,380
even even though like

1144
01:27:28,540 --> 01:27:33,420
Like if we're just talking like pokemon wise the moveset that Mew has

1145
01:27:34,700 --> 01:27:38,620
Probably way better than Mew two for smash it. Yeah

1146
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:43,260
I just also the tail the tail looks way more

1147
01:27:43,980 --> 01:27:48,700
Like human body anatomy muffin friendly. You're right

1148
01:27:49,580 --> 01:27:51,580
So like you just can't

1149
01:27:51,980 --> 01:27:54,620
Those little arms. It's also just too cute

1150
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:58,860
Well, I could hug it. I don't need it to hug me

1151
01:28:00,620 --> 01:28:05,580
I was like, it's a little paw paws. It's so cute. I can't I like the world something so cute

1152
01:28:06,780 --> 01:28:08,780
Mew is a fetus

1153
01:28:11,820 --> 01:28:12,620
Ah

1154
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:16,620
Well, if I guess I'm looking at it like a fetus, I guess I'd eat it more than I would

1155
01:28:17,180 --> 01:28:19,180
I'd eat a fetus

1156
01:28:20,460 --> 01:28:23,020
I mean, it's just under cooked meat

1157
01:28:24,460 --> 01:28:26,460
Yeah, that's a good point

1158
01:28:27,180 --> 01:28:29,180
Um chikorita

1159
01:28:29,740 --> 01:28:33,260
Uh canonical first yandere of the pokemon series

1160
01:28:34,460 --> 01:28:36,460
I would eat chikorita

1161
01:28:37,340 --> 01:28:41,180
I want animation. I think of someone like cooking a chikorita. I was like that looks delicious

1162
01:28:41,820 --> 01:28:45,820
So do you think like it's it's more meat or more vegetable? I feel like

1163
01:28:47,580 --> 01:28:50,060
I feel like it has like a meaty core

1164
01:28:51,020 --> 01:28:53,020
But like veggie on the outside

1165
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:57,100
I'm gonna pass on eating this thing, but it's definitely not a smash

1166
01:28:58,540 --> 01:29:01,740
I'm gonna pass and I'm gonna eat it. I know you don't like vegetables that much

1167
01:29:02,460 --> 01:29:04,460
I hate vegetables

1168
01:29:04,940 --> 01:29:10,380
Okay, bay leaf is sexy though. I like bay leaf. I like bay leaf's face. I like I like their style

1169
01:29:10,620 --> 01:29:13,660
I would smash bay leaf. Yeah, bay leaf is a smash

1170
01:29:14,620 --> 01:29:19,260
Chikorita's an impossible burger. Understandable. I would get that meat substitute

1171
01:29:19,980 --> 01:29:25,820
The Thickorita video I now I'm tempted to find out what that is. Smash bay leaf

1172
01:29:26,300 --> 01:29:27,260
Um

1173
01:29:27,260 --> 01:29:29,260
Meganium

1174
01:29:32,460 --> 01:29:34,460
It's just essentially almost a feminine

1175
01:29:35,500 --> 01:29:39,100
Yeah, I bet it smells nice like yeah, gardenia. Ooh

1176
01:29:41,340 --> 01:29:43,340
Smash yeah

1177
01:29:43,980 --> 01:29:45,420
Cyndaquil

1178
01:29:45,420 --> 01:29:48,060
Oh, that's a pass but a cuddler. Yeah

1179
01:29:48,940 --> 01:29:50,940
I want one. I want to get poked

1180
01:29:51,820 --> 01:29:56,300
Quilava burned, but like real cute real cute

1181
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:01,100
Quilava looks too sassy to me

1182
01:30:01,740 --> 01:30:04,300
Now quilava is a smash for me. Yeah

1183
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:10,460
Yeah, he's in his in his rebellious teenage phase. I know he has a little mohawk going

1184
01:30:11,420 --> 01:30:15,340
He's got that anime protagonist. He just needs goggles and a scarf

1185
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:19,500
Maybe like some maybe like some gloves too

1186
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:28,060
So real got yourself a whole OC here. Just need some accessories. That's true. You could turn off the flames. That's a good point

1187
01:30:29,660 --> 01:30:31,660
Um, I'll pass

1188
01:30:32,940 --> 01:30:34,940
Typhlosion I'd smash

1189
01:30:36,380 --> 01:30:37,980
Good

1190
01:30:37,980 --> 01:30:39,980
Good good

1191
01:30:40,700 --> 01:30:42,700
Good as he is a smash

1192
01:30:43,100 --> 01:30:45,100
uh

1193
01:30:45,660 --> 01:30:49,260
Typhlosion his he I can't never pronounce that looks a little bit

1194
01:30:50,460 --> 01:30:52,460
Predatory in my opinion

1195
01:30:53,580 --> 01:30:56,460
It's a smash for me. Yeah, he's got prettier

1196
01:30:58,540 --> 01:31:00,540
I need

1197
01:31:01,340 --> 01:31:06,620
He's like ladies. Can I buy you a drink? I don't know. He just seems sleazy to me

1198
01:31:06,620 --> 01:31:10,300
I'm gonna like he's really nice to look at but I feel like I ended up being disappointed

1199
01:31:11,340 --> 01:31:13,820
You know what? I'm okay with him looking sleazy

1200
01:31:14,300 --> 01:31:18,940
Because like all all he's got to do is like close his eyes and have like that fox face expression

1201
01:31:19,340 --> 01:31:26,460
Okay, like some some uh dojins have and I'm just I'm sold. I'm just here's the bedroom eyes. Very true

1202
01:31:27,180 --> 01:31:28,380
All right

1203
01:31:28,380 --> 01:31:29,900
Totodile

1204
01:31:29,900 --> 01:31:31,900
No, oh no

1205
01:31:32,220 --> 01:31:35,260
Totodile is one of my favorite. I would usually

1206
01:31:35,980 --> 01:31:37,260
um

1207
01:31:37,260 --> 01:31:39,260
I forgot is that heart gold?

1208
01:31:39,660 --> 01:31:44,060
I think totodile gold silver. Yeah, uh, I love my heart gold game

1209
01:31:44,540 --> 01:31:46,540
I love totodile so much

1210
01:31:46,860 --> 01:31:50,860
And that it's evolutions because they were my starter. I can't I could never

1211
01:31:52,140 --> 01:31:55,340
I guess totodile has always been a delight. Yeah

1212
01:31:56,300 --> 01:31:59,260
Crocodile is ugly to look at though. I hate crocodile

1213
01:32:00,140 --> 01:32:01,340
He needs

1214
01:32:01,340 --> 01:32:06,060
He needs a little club. He needed a bone club. He needs to pull this together. Yeah

1215
01:32:06,620 --> 01:32:10,700
He looks so much like a dinosaur rather than like a crocodile here in my opinion. Yeah

1216
01:32:11,740 --> 01:32:17,500
Um, but it's still a pass. Yeah for alligator looks like he's cross-eyed sometimes and he's like screaming

1217
01:32:21,740 --> 01:32:27,900
I look I feel like for alligator. I would just ask why are you so loud? Yeah, I feel like he's about to hit the dab

1218
01:32:27,900 --> 01:32:29,900
Um

1219
01:32:31,260 --> 01:32:34,140
Let it be said the for alligator is a dancer

1220
01:32:38,540 --> 01:32:40,860
For alligators, I'm going to chase you down the alley

1221
01:32:42,060 --> 01:32:46,220
He's referring to t-pose. Yeah, I just I'm gonna pass the for alligator

1222
01:32:46,860 --> 01:32:47,980
uh

1223
01:32:47,980 --> 01:32:49,980
centret

1224
01:32:49,980 --> 01:32:51,740
uh

1225
01:32:51,740 --> 01:32:52,940
Pass

1226
01:32:52,940 --> 01:32:55,020
Yeah, I don't know what I could do with that

1227
01:32:55,980 --> 01:33:00,300
I mean a hug. Yeah, definitely hug hundred percent hug

1228
01:33:01,740 --> 01:33:03,740
But it's a pass. Yeah

1229
01:33:04,620 --> 01:33:06,620
Now furret

1230
01:33:08,620 --> 01:33:10,620
Furret's too cute for me

1231
01:33:11,340 --> 01:33:17,740
Nah, furret's a great up smash because first of all furrets are real fucking big furrets are big

1232
01:33:17,740 --> 01:33:23,420
They're pretty giant. I always thought they were small and then I remember looking at the pokedex and seeing how big they actually were

1233
01:33:23,420 --> 01:33:27,340
And I was like what the fuck furret seems a vigorous. Mmm

1234
01:33:28,140 --> 01:33:30,140
Also, I just love that song

1235
01:33:43,660 --> 01:33:47,180
Um, I'll pass on furret you're smashing him. I'm smashing him

1236
01:33:47,740 --> 01:33:49,740
Uh hoot hoot

1237
01:33:49,820 --> 01:33:51,820
No, that's an owl

1238
01:33:52,140 --> 01:33:55,980
I thought with one foot that is a poor baby disabled owl

1239
01:33:56,940 --> 01:33:59,340
I remember I used to pronounce it hoot

1240
01:34:01,100 --> 01:34:08,060
I mean to be fair though, it's pokemon so that that could be a legitimate american pronunciation

1241
01:34:08,220 --> 01:34:10,220
hoot

1242
01:34:11,660 --> 01:34:13,660
Oh pass knocked owl

1243
01:34:16,620 --> 01:34:20,780
He's so serious very serious. I feel like he'd be such a boring lay

1244
01:34:21,900 --> 01:34:23,260
Yeah

1245
01:34:23,260 --> 01:34:25,660
And he would just be really judgmental of you after

1246
01:34:25,660 --> 01:34:30,460
Yeah, like, you know, you could have done this better or I didn't like how you did that and I'm just like

1247
01:34:31,020 --> 01:34:33,020
I didn't even get to come

1248
01:34:33,260 --> 01:34:34,620
so

1249
01:34:34,620 --> 01:34:39,100
I bet this knocked owl would look at you and be like I can tell the type of poor and you watch is boring

1250
01:34:41,980 --> 01:34:47,260
Like like he's into some real freaky stuff and he's always trying to ask you for a little bit more

1251
01:34:47,580 --> 01:34:52,460
And you're just like you're a fucking owl. I don't want to do that. And he's like, why are you even here? Yeah

1252
01:34:54,620 --> 01:34:56,620
All right pass the knocked owl

1253
01:34:57,020 --> 01:34:59,020
ladyba

1254
01:34:59,260 --> 01:35:01,420
Hmm, ladyba is so cute

1255
01:35:02,860 --> 01:35:06,060
Ladyba is so cute. There's little fist leggies

1256
01:35:07,020 --> 01:35:09,020
Looks like he's gonna punch me

1257
01:35:09,580 --> 01:35:15,500
But like adorably like it won't hurt. It'll be like a little like like squishy noise like the squeaky squeaky toy noise

1258
01:35:16,300 --> 01:35:20,300
Yeah, I think ladyba's like a pass for me. Yeah

1259
01:35:21,180 --> 01:35:22,700
Yeah

1260
01:35:22,700 --> 01:35:24,700
You're hearing audio cut out

1261
01:35:25,500 --> 01:35:29,180
Oh, it's it. Uh, is it me? Is it me my audio coming out?

1262
01:35:31,980 --> 01:35:33,980
Tell us

1263
01:35:34,620 --> 01:35:36,620
360 degree eye contact though

1264
01:35:37,740 --> 01:35:39,740
I mean, that's pretty impressive

1265
01:35:40,140 --> 01:35:42,140
Very impressive

1266
01:35:42,620 --> 01:35:45,500
Epee. Uh, all right pass ladyba

1267
01:35:46,940 --> 01:35:48,940
Okay pass ladyba

1268
01:35:49,980 --> 01:35:51,740
Lady in

1269
01:35:51,740 --> 01:35:56,220
Okay, I really like lady ins design though. Me too. Like a like a little sentai guy

1270
01:35:57,500 --> 01:35:59,500
He really does look like a little sentai guy

1271
01:36:00,540 --> 01:36:02,540
All audio, huh?

1272
01:36:02,940 --> 01:36:08,700
Well, the stream did like turn into a black screen for me for a moment. So I did it could be my bit rate

1273
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:11,180
Oh, yeah, my bit rate is shit right now

1274
01:36:12,140 --> 01:36:14,700
Damn, I just looked at it. I'm getting so many dropped frames

1275
01:36:15,820 --> 01:36:19,580
Um, yeah, the stream is lagging. I can see it

1276
01:36:20,860 --> 01:36:22,460
Oh

1277
01:36:22,460 --> 01:36:24,460
No

1278
01:36:26,060 --> 01:36:30,940
I'm not getting ever getting buffering. That's too bad. Yeah, my I literally have like

1279
01:36:32,380 --> 01:36:35,340
Normal bit rate, but I have so many dropped frames right now

1280
01:36:36,380 --> 01:36:40,380
You know what? It's just youtube trying to nerf us because we're too powerful with these

1281
01:36:41,340 --> 01:36:43,340
Definitely, they're just like stop

1282
01:36:43,820 --> 01:36:45,820
You can't handle it

1283
01:36:45,820 --> 01:36:47,820
enough

1284
01:36:48,060 --> 01:36:51,580
Um, it's normal now. It hasn't it's gonna keep doing that. I can tell

1285
01:36:52,460 --> 01:36:56,140
I can see it doing it on my oh there it goes now. It's good

1286
01:36:57,260 --> 01:36:58,460
We're back

1287
01:36:58,460 --> 01:37:00,460
All right, we've never been more back

1288
01:37:00,780 --> 01:37:03,980
Uh, I'm passing on lady and just because I just I just want to be his friend

1289
01:37:04,700 --> 01:37:06,700
Yeah, like we would go on a picnic

1290
01:37:07,020 --> 01:37:10,140
Yeah, 100 and then he would like show me his cool fighting moves

1291
01:37:12,300 --> 01:37:14,860
I'd make him a flower crown. That's cute

1292
01:37:17,100 --> 01:37:19,100
Okay, spin or act spin or act

1293
01:37:19,740 --> 01:37:23,100
I was like it's a like unhappy face on the back on its little butt

1294
01:37:24,940 --> 01:37:28,700
Because like I bet I bet he hears nothing but people screaming at him

1295
01:37:30,060 --> 01:37:32,460
I'd hang out with him. I take him on a date

1296
01:37:33,980 --> 01:37:35,980
I wouldn't do anything though

1297
01:37:36,780 --> 01:37:39,180
Yeah, but like I love spiders

1298
01:37:41,340 --> 01:37:47,100
I would definitely let him stay in my house and yeah, we locate him to the outside. Yeah, I'll be like you can hang out

1299
01:37:47,180 --> 01:37:48,620
You can be a roomie

1300
01:37:48,620 --> 01:37:50,220
I'll pass

1301
01:37:50,220 --> 01:37:52,060
yeah

1302
01:37:52,060 --> 01:37:56,620
And then they just like randomly glow up and they get their roommate that gets a little bit handsomer

1303
01:37:56,700 --> 01:38:00,220
And you're just like should I and then you kind of like fight internally with yourself

1304
01:38:01,340 --> 01:38:03,900
That's how I would feel about this spider

1305
01:38:04,860 --> 01:38:06,540
In

1306
01:38:06,540 --> 01:38:08,540
Ariados, yeah

1307
01:38:08,700 --> 01:38:10,220
You know

1308
01:38:10,220 --> 01:38:12,220
honestly infinite rope

1309
01:38:21,340 --> 01:38:23,340
I'm gonna smash their

1310
01:38:23,980 --> 01:38:30,940
I was also smashing. I'm also just thinking of like spider riders. Does anybody remember spider riders calling all spider

1311
01:38:31,580 --> 01:38:33,580
Riders, that's

1312
01:38:34,860 --> 01:38:36,860
I remember spider riders

1313
01:38:37,020 --> 01:38:39,820

Just for a second. I think it's back up now. Okay

1318
01:38:54,540 --> 01:38:56,540
Weird

1319
01:38:57,260 --> 01:39:03,660

1320
01:39:04,780 --> 01:39:06,780

1325
01:39:18,220 --> 01:39:20,220

1329
01:39:41,660 --> 01:39:42,940
Yeah

1330
01:39:42,940 --> 01:39:47,580
Oh, yeah, I could see a lot of people dropped off randomly. That's too bad. Damn you YouTube

1331
01:39:48,540 --> 01:39:51,900
Hopefully they find out the stream again. Um, let's get to you

1332
01:39:52,380 --> 01:39:54,380

01:39:56,540 --> 01:39:57,900
Oh

1335
01:39:57,900 --> 01:40:02,060
I think chinchu is so cute. Chinchu is so cute. I couldn't do anything to this little baby

1336
01:40:03,180 --> 01:40:09,660
No, no, I couldn't do anything to them. They're too cute. Yeah and lantern lantern just looks like a such a happy person

1337
01:40:10,620 --> 01:40:12,460
Little happy pokemon

1338
01:40:12,460 --> 01:40:17,100
They're just happy to tell you what they found in the ocean today. Yeah, I found a seashell

1339
01:40:17,420 --> 01:40:21,740
And you're just like, yeah, then you kind of just go a little like see adventures with them

1340
01:40:22,540 --> 01:40:24,700
Yeah, yeah, I'll be a good friend

1341
01:40:26,860 --> 01:40:31,660
Pichu I'm gonna sound really really inhumane, but I'm eating that motherfucker

1342
01:40:36,700 --> 01:40:41,900
I'll eat them right alongside you hell. Yeah, we're eating this little mouse

1343
01:40:43,820 --> 01:40:45,820
Uh also eating clefa

1344
01:40:47,340 --> 01:40:53,020
There's there's no room for argument here. They're both they're both edible. I bet they taste like candy

1345
01:40:53,180 --> 01:40:54,540
I know

1346
01:40:54,540 --> 01:40:59,740
Pichu's probably like lemon flavor candy clefa bubblegum flavor. Yeah, I was like it looks like bubblegum

1347
01:41:00,300 --> 01:41:03,420
I'm chewing on that with bits of chocolate. Yeah

1348
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:07,660
Iggly buff

1349
01:41:07,660 --> 01:41:11,340
I almost said ugly buff. I mean, you're not wrong

1350
01:41:14,300 --> 01:41:15,740
Also

1351
01:41:15,740 --> 01:41:17,740
It's like balls on its head

1352
01:41:17,820 --> 01:41:23,020
When they introduced baby pokemon in the second gen they fucked up because these are just food

1353
01:41:23,420 --> 01:41:27,900
Yeah, I'm I'm eating this one. I don't get the spiral in the middle of its head. I don't know the lore from that

1354
01:41:28,540 --> 01:41:31,820
That's like its baby curl. It's big. Oh, I don't like that

1355
01:41:32,940 --> 01:41:34,940
Yeah, it just looks like a Naruto

1356
01:41:35,340 --> 01:41:37,340
village sign

1357
01:41:38,140 --> 01:41:40,140
Oh, it's from the leaf village

1358
01:41:40,940 --> 01:41:42,460
I'm eating it

1359
01:41:42,460 --> 01:41:47,340
Jigglypuff's got to get her curl from somewhere. That's her baby hair. That's her baby hair

1360
01:41:48,300 --> 01:41:50,300
Uh togapi

1361
01:41:50,300 --> 01:41:52,700
Eating eating eating this egg

1362
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:55,980
It's just an egg that sat a little too long. Yeah

1363
01:41:57,180 --> 01:41:59,180
Gain sentience

1364
01:42:00,780 --> 01:42:03,980
Little too hard boiled, but that's okay. We can fix that. Yeah

1365
01:42:06,860 --> 01:42:10,060
I'm trying to think about how I would prepare this togapi

1366
01:42:13,260 --> 01:42:14,860
Hmm

1367
01:42:14,860 --> 01:42:17,820
You know since it's like technically a hard hard boiled egg

1368
01:42:17,900 --> 01:42:22,380
All you have to do is like maybe like stab it and then you can probably just eat it

1369
01:42:22,780 --> 01:42:24,780
Yeah, maybe it'll be like a little deviled egg moment

1370
01:42:25,500 --> 01:42:26,700
Oh, yeah

1371
01:42:26,700 --> 01:42:27,980
Ooh, that'd be pretty good

1372
01:42:27,980 --> 01:42:31,100
Like yeah, like you cut off like the top where the three spikes are

1373
01:42:31,420 --> 01:42:35,420
Yeah, you scoop out the insides and you make like the inside for devil salad. Mm-hmm

1374
01:42:36,540 --> 01:42:37,740
Delicious

1375
01:42:37,740 --> 01:42:43,820
When this turn into an eater pass, uh, how we do pokemon smash or pass is we do you'll uh,

1376
01:42:43,980 --> 01:42:45,500
Smash or pass them

1377
01:42:45,500 --> 01:42:50,460
Or we will also eat them or we'll rob them because some of them have jewels and we want to steal them

1378
01:42:52,460 --> 01:42:54,460
Devil's togapi, uh

1379
01:42:55,740 --> 01:42:57,740
I can't pronounce that

1380
01:42:58,300 --> 01:43:02,540
Oh, that's toga tick. Oh toga tick. I was like, yes togetic

1381
01:43:05,100 --> 01:43:07,100

Smash pass eat and rob

1383
01:43:09,500 --> 01:43:12,460
Honestly, I'd let I live and let live for this one

1384
01:43:13,980 --> 01:43:15,980
Isn't it really big?

1385
01:43:16,140 --> 01:43:21,340
No, not quite the next one is though. Okay, because I'm like, can't you like fly on one of them or whatever?

1386
01:43:22,060 --> 01:43:25,340
Yeah, it's the last one. Okay. I don't I'm gonna pass on this one

1387
01:43:28,060 --> 01:43:33,820
Oh, I forgot the next one comes in the next gen. Yep, that's right actually not to

1388
01:43:34,780 --> 01:43:36,780
Eating that it looks like a green apple

1389
01:43:37,820 --> 01:43:38,780
Honestly

1390
01:43:38,780 --> 01:43:44,140
I I want to pick it up and bounce it because it looks like it has like the same feeling as a tennis ball

1391
01:43:45,420 --> 01:43:48,780
I was thinking like a bouncy ball. I would chew on it because then maybe it's like rubbery

1392
01:43:49,500 --> 01:43:51,820
Like a chew I want to know if it smells like a tennis ball

1393
01:43:52,780 --> 01:43:55,820
Okay sniffing sniffing not we have a new

1394
01:43:56,620 --> 01:43:58,620
entry sniff

1395
01:43:59,420 --> 01:44:03,820
I definitely would give him a whiff. He looks like he smells like a tennis ball

1396
01:44:04,940 --> 01:44:06,940
Uh, is that too?

1397
01:44:06,940 --> 01:44:08,940
It's a tennis ball tent

1398
01:44:09,100 --> 01:44:12,540
It is a tennis ball tent with a little cat on his on his shirt

1399
01:44:13,900 --> 01:44:17,180
Very cute. I feel like he would like open up his wings and flash me

1400
01:44:18,700 --> 01:44:19,900
Yeah

1401
01:44:19,900 --> 01:44:21,500
Like you think he's

1402
01:44:21,500 --> 01:44:23,500
You think he's like skinny underneath the rope

1403
01:44:24,220 --> 01:44:30,380
Uh because of the the spacing of his feet. I feel like he's pretty close in the body type

1404
01:44:31,420 --> 01:44:33,420
Under the robe like that shape

1405
01:44:34,460 --> 01:44:36,140
Hmm

1406
01:44:36,140 --> 01:44:39,580
Wait, isn't that wait, isn't that just actually his wings just held in front of him?

1407
01:44:40,780 --> 01:44:42,780
So he is just like

1408
01:44:44,460 --> 01:44:46,460
That cone shape

1409
01:44:47,100 --> 01:44:52,140
I don't know that would mean he's pretty wide. You know what either way it's a pass for me. Yeah

1410
01:44:54,060 --> 01:44:56,060

01:45:44,460 --> 01:45:45,820
um

1426
01:45:45,820 --> 01:45:48,860
Because it just turns into like something else entirely

1427
01:45:50,140 --> 01:45:52,140
Yeah from a sheet

1428
01:45:53,020 --> 01:45:59,900
Like I don't even know what this thing becomes but like I've always thought it was pretty. Yeah, I always like this this lane

1429
01:46:00,780 --> 01:46:01,900

Oh man, so for me

01:47:00,540 --> 01:47:06,380
I remember when like the magazines came out when we were just about to learn what gen 2 was going to be like

1445
01:47:06,700 --> 01:47:08,700
And they were calling merrill peekaboo

01:49:09,500 --> 01:49:11,500
I guess I would blow then

1480
01:49:12,140 --> 01:49:15,820
Yeah, definitely definitely a blow platonically blow

1481
01:49:16,700 --> 01:49:18,700
Jumpluff, uh

1482
01:49:19,180 --> 01:49:21,180
Safer work version. Yeah

1483
01:49:24,540 --> 01:49:26,540
And then I might eat it after I blow it

1484
01:49:27,340 --> 01:49:29,340
That sounds weird

1485
01:49:31,980 --> 01:49:33,980
A pom

1486
01:49:35,100 --> 01:49:37,100
Monkey, I know you're like your monkeys

1487
01:49:37,660 --> 01:49:43,500
I do like my monkeys, but a pom's always kind of pissed me off a little bit. All right

1488
01:49:44,780 --> 01:49:49,980
And I don't know what it is about a pom. I just a pom doesn't feel like a smash for me

1489
01:49:50,780 --> 01:49:53,180
Understandable. I feel like a pom

1490
01:49:54,140 --> 01:49:57,820
I just seems like he would just pull some really stupid shit during

1491
01:49:58,780 --> 01:50:00,780
And then like as like a prank

1492
01:50:01,580 --> 01:50:04,620
And then just like try to laugh about it afterwards

1493
01:50:04,620 --> 01:50:10,380
But like it makes me feel really bad or so. I don't know like like he would run up slap your ass

1494
01:50:10,460 --> 01:50:16,060
And when you tried to get mad at him, he would be like, it's just a prank bro. It's just a prank. Yeah, I just don't

1495
01:50:17,340 --> 01:50:18,940
I'm good

1496
01:50:18,940 --> 01:50:20,940
Sunker

1497
01:50:20,940 --> 01:50:25,820
Okay, but how can you say no to that face? I love suckers face. It's like

1498
01:50:38,140 --> 01:50:41,260
I'm holding it possibly bouncing it

1499
01:50:42,220 --> 01:50:44,860
It's going in my pocket. Yeah, definitely

1500
01:50:45,580 --> 01:50:48,460
Definitely stuck in the pocket could use it as a plug

1501
01:50:49,100 --> 01:50:54,860
But I don't know. I don't want to I don't think I'd use it sexually. Yeah

1502
01:50:56,620 --> 01:51:00,460
I'm gonna pass definitely a pass uh sun flora. No

1503
01:51:01,740 --> 01:51:05,180
I'm not even gonna sniff that. I feel like if I sniff that I'll be roofy

1504
01:51:06,060 --> 01:51:08,060
Yeah, and I wake up

1505
01:51:08,540 --> 01:51:10,540
in like a terrible place

1506
01:51:11,740 --> 01:51:13,740
And he laces his pedals

1507
01:51:14,380 --> 01:51:15,900
and they are

1508
01:51:15,900 --> 01:51:18,220
And then he'd be like filling me up with those little leafy arms

1509
01:51:19,660 --> 01:51:21,100
Yeah, nah

1510
01:51:21,100 --> 01:51:23,100
Yeah, nah pass

1511
01:51:23,580 --> 01:51:25,580
Pass uh, yanma

That's a dragonfly

1513
01:51:27,500 --> 01:51:29,900
That's a pass for me. I'm squashing that bug

1514
01:51:30,620 --> 01:51:33,020
Just kidding. I would never do that because I like dragonflies, but

1515
01:51:34,700 --> 01:51:36,380
Whopper

1516
01:51:36,380 --> 01:51:40,380
Okay, I can't I can't I can't do anything to whopper except hug it

1517
01:51:41,260 --> 01:51:42,780

Uh, I will I'll choose to love whopper

1523
01:51:59,740 --> 01:52:04,140
I choose to love and cherish whopper for the rest of my life. All right

1524
01:52:05,180 --> 01:52:09,420
If anything were to happen to whopper, I would kill everyone in this room including myself

We're back to the hot dogs. Yep

1535
01:52:40,380 --> 01:52:42,380
Hot hot cat dog

1536
01:52:42,940 --> 01:52:44,940
Yeah, let me just look at his butt

1537
01:52:46,300 --> 01:52:52,060
Look at that gaze look at that. It knows what it's doing. It knows

1538
01:52:53,340 --> 01:52:55,100
She's asking for it

1539
01:52:55,100 --> 01:52:57,100
Fox whatever

1540
01:52:57,100 --> 01:53:00,860
She's got cheek fluff. She's she's cheeked up. Um

1541
01:53:02,940 --> 01:53:04,940
I'm taking my strap to the espion

1542
01:53:06,940 --> 01:53:08,940
Smash

1543
01:53:08,940 --> 01:53:10,700
Umbreon

1544
01:53:10,700 --> 01:53:12,700
Smash smash

1545
01:53:16,300 --> 01:53:18,620
Uh, I don't even think this bird would taste good

1546
01:53:19,980 --> 01:53:25,740
No, it'd be like two billion expression of eating crow. Yeah, I'm I'm good pass

1547
01:53:27,020 --> 01:53:29,020
Slow king

1548
01:53:30,380 --> 01:53:32,380
Smash smash

1549
01:53:32,700 --> 01:53:34,700
Mm-hmm

1550
01:53:35,740 --> 01:53:37,740
Maybe he takes off his hat

1551
01:53:38,140 --> 01:53:41,180
Not the hat stays on I don't want him to bump me with it

1552
01:53:41,980 --> 01:53:45,580
Well, just don't just don't put your head up there. Okay

1553
01:53:46,860 --> 01:53:48,860
How big is slow king

1554
01:53:49,420 --> 01:53:50,620
Uh

1555
01:53:50,620 --> 01:53:54,860
I think he's like what five feet how tall are we as muppets?

1556
01:53:57,020 --> 01:53:59,020
Are we like a foot tall? What are we?

1557
01:53:59,980 --> 01:54:04,460
So let's see here. I think slow king slow king's about six foot seven

1558
01:54:05,420 --> 01:54:06,860
What?

1559
01:54:06,860 --> 01:54:08,540
Yeah

1560
01:54:08,540 --> 01:54:10,540
Or I guess he's like

1561
01:54:10,700 --> 01:54:12,700
Five foot eleven

1562
01:54:13,260 --> 01:54:19,340
Bulbapedia is giving me two different answers. Okay, so average slow king's fucking six feet tall for no reason

1563
01:54:20,380 --> 01:54:22,380
um

1564
01:54:22,460 --> 01:54:24,460
I might steal a hat

1565
01:54:25,100 --> 01:54:28,140
I'm also again wondering how big I am how big are we?

1566
01:54:29,100 --> 01:54:35,020
Well, I mean canonical. Well, we're on. Well, if you if you check yourself, you'll see that you're on a hand

1567
01:54:35,420 --> 01:54:39,660
I'm looking at my hand size right now. So that means I'm like less than a foot

1568
01:54:40,380 --> 01:54:43,260
Yeah, you're probably like about two feet

1569
01:54:44,860 --> 01:54:49,020
Because like you got to put your hand into the top. Oh, that's true

1570
01:54:49,980 --> 01:54:53,500
Okay, and then like the rest of it's got to be your body. So like

1571
01:54:54,220 --> 01:54:58,940
About two feet because like your hand itself is maybe like what six inches

1572
01:55:03,340 --> 01:55:04,780
I need a

1573
01:55:04,780 --> 01:55:06,380
I need a ruler

1574
01:55:06,380 --> 01:55:08,380
I have very long fingers

1575
01:55:08,540 --> 01:55:10,540
Now harlots, did you know

1576
01:55:11,500 --> 01:55:16,460
If your hand is bigger than your face, you might be a candidate for a cancer screening

1577
01:55:17,180 --> 01:55:18,700
Wait, what?

1578
01:55:18,700 --> 01:55:22,300
My hand is half bigger than my face and I'm safe. Did you actually put your hand up there?

1579
01:55:22,380 --> 01:55:26,860
I did if I know if you were here you would have smacked me in the face. Yes, I would

1580
01:55:33,820 --> 01:55:37,020
We need to do an off collab where we do this in person

1581
01:55:38,380 --> 01:55:45,660
I just actually get smacked in the face for my stupidity. I realized what that was afterwards. I was like wait, I remember this

1582
01:55:51,180 --> 01:55:54,300
All right, I guess I'll smash low king. Yeah

1583
01:55:58,540 --> 01:56:01,260
Still a smash for me, baby. No, thanks

1584
01:56:02,540 --> 01:56:07,500
That's still a smash for me. I don't like it. This one's only 511 though

1585
01:56:08,380 --> 01:56:10,380
I don't like it. I'm passing

1586
01:56:10,780 --> 01:56:12,300
smash him

1587
01:56:12,300 --> 01:56:14,860
Are we gonna do you want to pause and mistreat us?

1588
01:56:15,500 --> 01:56:17,500
Yeah, we're at an even 200

1589
01:56:17,500 --> 01:56:22,780
Yeah, and and like after that we get into like the good ones like low punny and all that good

1590
01:56:25,740 --> 01:56:27,740
My beloved

1591
01:56:28,140 --> 01:56:30,140
All right

1592
01:56:30,140 --> 01:56:33,340
I'll pick this up next week. Yeah, I do

1593
01:56:34,220 --> 01:56:43,900
We it's gonna be like seven episodes like a hundred an episode or eight episodes. So that's just smashing and passing

1594
01:56:46,780 --> 01:56:49,900
Tell me what day you want to do it on and we'll schedule it

1595
01:56:54,140 --> 01:56:56,140
Yes

1596
01:56:56,460 --> 01:56:57,820

um, I hope you guys again, uh

1601
01:57:14,860 --> 01:57:19,260
Trinket slash toma made my muppet form. So please

1605
01:57:41,820 --> 01:57:44,140
Just like how I sometimes am shebethany

1606
01:57:44,940 --> 01:57:46,940
Uh, let me do an actual

1607
01:57:48,140 --> 01:57:50,140
clickable link

1608
01:57:52,380 --> 01:57:54,380
Yeah, yeah

01:58:00,220 --> 01:58:01,820
Heck yeah

1611
01:58:01,820 --> 01:58:03,820
Yes, I understand the message was unpanned

1612
01:58:05,420 --> 01:58:07,420
I'll pin this one

1613
01:58:07,900 --> 01:58:09,900
You know the bots just need you to know

1614
01:58:10,620 --> 01:58:14,140
That's that you're just undoing the thing that you said you wanted to do. Yeah

1615
01:58:16,620 --> 01:58:19,420
Um, but toma is very cool

1616
01:58:20,140 --> 01:58:25,260
She's very talented and sweet as you can see she's a great artist from both of our

1617
01:58:26,380 --> 01:58:28,380
muppet forms

1618
01:58:28,860 --> 01:58:32,620
Do you want to tell them the good news by the way that you showed me the other day?

1619
01:58:33,340 --> 01:58:35,100
the pdf

1620
01:58:35,100 --> 01:58:37,660
Oh, I have drawn up

1621
01:58:38,460 --> 01:58:40,460
What is a rigable?

1622
01:58:40,700 --> 01:58:41,580
uh

1623
01:58:41,580 --> 01:58:43,580
shibby cotton bum muppet

1624
01:58:44,700 --> 01:58:46,700
That can be live 2d rigged

1625
01:58:47,180 --> 01:58:50,060
unfortunately, I'm a little dog water at

1626
01:58:50,860 --> 01:58:52,860
rigging so

1627
01:58:53,420 --> 01:58:55,260
I might

1628
01:58:55,260 --> 01:58:57,500
Need a lot of time to rig it

1629
01:58:59,340 --> 01:59:01,340
Or I can find somebody to help

1630
01:59:02,940 --> 01:59:04,780
Rig it

1631
01:59:04,780 --> 01:59:06,780
DEMPA actually might know how to rig

1632
01:59:07,100 --> 01:59:09,740
Mike you could probably ask DEMPA. I just thought of that

1633
01:59:10,700 --> 01:59:12,140
Maybe

1634
01:59:12,140 --> 01:59:15,740
I just and it's funny because like I just like woke up and she's like look what I made

1635
01:59:17,180 --> 01:59:19,180
She just slid me the pdf

1636
01:59:19,580 --> 01:59:22,940
And I was just screaming I was so happy

1637
01:59:23,900 --> 01:59:29,420
I'll tell you I'll I'll tell you how it how it came to be. I was there the entire uh

1638
01:59:30,540 --> 01:59:35,260
Ellen ring stream. Yeah, the entire elden ring stream and I was just working on it

1639
01:59:37,180 --> 01:59:39,180
It's it's you guys don't even know

1640
01:59:40,460 --> 01:59:42,300
My final form

1641
01:59:42,300 --> 01:59:44,300
Slowly coming to fruition

1642
01:59:45,580 --> 01:59:51,980
I'm tempted even a surprise. There's even a surprise in the pdf for you. No, I didn't even I didn't want to uh

1643
01:59:52,380 --> 01:59:57,340
peek through the files too deeply because I kind of wanted to wait and be surprised until it's rigged

1644
01:59:58,140 --> 02:00:00,140
um

1645
02:00:02,780 --> 02:00:05,500
Maybe I can also look at some rig videos to see if I can do it myself

1646
02:00:06,220 --> 02:00:09,020
I've never even tried rigging before but it's a very good skill to have

1647
02:00:09,980 --> 02:00:12,460
It is yeah, and just being able to cut

1648
02:00:13,180 --> 02:00:15,180
Stuff as well to make models

1649
02:00:15,420 --> 02:00:19,500
Um, I need to learn how to draw properly first. I'm still working on that

1650
02:00:20,140 --> 02:00:27,260
You draw plenty. Well, it's really cute your art style. It's developing into something that suits you. Oh, thank you. I try

1651
02:00:28,220 --> 02:00:29,580
Oh

1652
02:00:29,580 --> 02:00:34,220
But um, yeah, please give uh trinket a follow on tomah keys

1653
02:00:36,140 --> 02:00:39,360
We're starting a muppet tuba revolution

1654
02:00:40,700 --> 02:00:42,700
We love muppets. We love muppets here

1655
02:00:43,340 --> 02:00:46,220
Now I think I want to do a muppet watch a lot at some point

1656
02:00:46,700 --> 02:00:50,300
And probably have you on for that. We can watch like muppets in our space or something

1657
02:00:51,100 --> 02:00:55,740
Ah man, I was actually just talking about how in the late 2000s

1658
02:00:56,380 --> 02:00:58,380
Late 90s early 2000s

1659
02:00:58,380 --> 02:01:03,660
There was like just this theme of found family and it started off with gonzo just being like

1660
02:01:04,060 --> 02:01:06,540
I'm not sure if i'm a whatever anymore

1661
02:01:06,860 --> 02:01:11,420
And then you just the next year after that you come out with the tigger movie and it's like

1662
02:01:11,980 --> 02:01:16,140
Man, maybe being the only tigger isn't so based

1663
02:01:17,500 --> 02:01:19,500
That's such a good one. There was like a weird

1664
02:01:19,820 --> 02:01:22,060
Arrow where there was a lot of found family stuff

1665
02:01:22,140 --> 02:01:25,820
Which is also very sweet and cute because everybody deserves family, you know

1666
02:01:26,140 --> 02:01:29,900
But like I went back and I watched the trailer for the tigger movie, right?

1667
02:01:30,060 --> 02:01:34,380
Do you know how they advertise the tigger movie coming out? No, how did they?

1668
02:01:35,100 --> 02:01:38,460
Do you remember first they give you like a really high energy like

1669
02:01:39,100 --> 02:01:46,460
Basically the whole high energy song about tigger teaching ru how to do like the soup the the super duper alley uber

1670
02:01:47,580 --> 02:01:51,820
Bounce essentially doesn't he like it's raining and it gets really depressing or something

1671
02:01:52,300 --> 02:01:57,900
No, they don't show you any context to what happens in the movie. All you know

1672
02:01:57,980 --> 02:02:00,620
It's like, oh, it's a little tigger movie. My kids are gonna love this

1673
02:02:00,780 --> 02:02:05,340
They don't tell you about the trauma you're about to deliver upon your kids like firsthand

1674
02:02:05,900 --> 02:02:07,900
The tigger like runs away because he's like

1675
02:02:08,620 --> 02:02:13,420
My family never was coming. Well, I'm going to go find them. Oh my god

1676
02:02:14,140 --> 02:02:16,940
Like you don't know that you're in for an emotional bomb

1677
02:02:17,340 --> 02:02:22,540
They do the same fucking bullshit with the with the hunt for christopher or the search for christopher robin

1678
02:02:22,700 --> 02:02:28,460
Where it's like, oh no christopher robin's gone missing. We've got to go and find him. He's been stolen by

1679
02:02:29,260 --> 02:02:31,260
Skull

1680
02:02:31,260 --> 02:02:35,180
But it's like and then you have like winnie the pooh just getting all depressed

1681
02:02:35,580 --> 02:02:40,540
And everyone just doubting themselves the entire movie and winnie the pooh has like all this cryptic knowledge

1682
02:02:40,620 --> 02:02:43,260
That he can't remember because he's a silly old bear

1683
02:02:43,900 --> 02:02:45,900
It's the worst

1684
02:02:47,180 --> 02:02:49,180
We do not like

1685
02:02:49,180 --> 02:02:53,900
Winnie the pooh trauma trauma here whether it wouldn't matter the character

1686
02:02:55,660 --> 02:02:57,660
They don't deserve this

1687
02:02:57,660 --> 02:03:02,700
They do it to everyone though. The only people who haven't had trauma is perhaps kanga

1688
02:03:05,180 --> 02:03:08,940
Kanga hasn't had a single bit of trauma at all. Yeah, kanga's pretty chill

1689
02:03:09,820 --> 02:03:13,580
Kiglet's had trauma. I think it's trauma in the animated series

1690
02:03:13,980 --> 02:03:19,820
Tigger has a whole fucking movie about it. So does winnie the pooh. Eeyore's just like always depressed

1691
02:03:20,620 --> 02:03:26,300
Yeah, Eeyore Eeyore Eeyore never knows a moment's peace because he's always at the beck and call of everybody else

1692
02:03:27,820 --> 02:03:33,100
And then like you have made up characters like gopher who's like well study

1693
02:03:34,380 --> 02:03:36,380
Ah, i'm just dandy

1694
02:03:39,340 --> 02:03:42,540
I feel like yeah kanga is a single mom. That's right because i'm like i can't

1695
02:03:43,180 --> 02:03:45,980
I feel like she was like arguing with owl about something

1696
02:03:47,900 --> 02:03:49,900
She's a single mom. Yeah

1697
02:03:51,420 --> 02:03:54,460
And then owl nothing bad ever happens to owl

1698
02:03:55,420 --> 02:03:58,380
Owls in fact he causes all of the problem

1699
02:03:58,940 --> 02:04:04,860
Owl causes 90 of the problems because they all go to him because he's the owl and supposedly learned

1700
02:04:05,180 --> 02:04:07,180
But owl can't read either

1701
02:04:07,900 --> 02:04:09,500
Nope

1702
02:04:09,500 --> 02:04:12,380
He's secretly he thinks he's so smart, but he's not

1703
02:04:13,180 --> 02:04:15,180
He's not he just uses

1704
02:04:15,980 --> 02:04:19,180
The ignorance of the other animals against them

1705
02:04:20,300 --> 02:04:23,660
To be some pseudo leader in its sickening

1706
02:04:24,620 --> 02:04:28,220
And then they introduce like a half a lump and that doesn't really go anywhere

1707
02:04:29,660 --> 02:04:31,660
Half a lump is so cute though

1708
02:04:31,740 --> 02:04:33,740
What's his name? It's like ala something

1709
02:04:34,460 --> 02:04:39,660
I forget it did like ala wishes. Yeah ala wishes. I love that name ala wishes

1710
02:04:40,460 --> 02:04:42,060
It's so cute

1711
02:04:42,060 --> 02:04:46,700
And like I feel like if like 2d animation for disney had gone on for a little bit longer

1712
02:04:46,780 --> 02:04:50,220
We would have gotten a like a woozel character joining the cast as well

1713
02:04:50,700 --> 02:04:55,580
Like a little friendly woozel since we got a really friendly half a lump

1714
02:04:59,420 --> 02:05:01,420
Why don't they come up with these names

1715
02:05:04,460 --> 02:05:08,460
So owls just Congress I suppose yeah pretty much

1716
02:05:11,100 --> 02:05:13,100
I like how he just went on a random tangent

1717
02:05:13,500 --> 02:05:15,500
I'm not waiting for the whole character

1718
02:05:16,140 --> 02:05:19,500
I'm so sorry. No when it was the both of us and it was so funny

1719
02:05:20,620 --> 02:05:22,620
Oh

1720
02:05:24,220 --> 02:05:29,180
Okay, well, is there any closing words you want to say to the harem before we

1721
02:05:29,900 --> 02:05:31,900
You say goodbye

1722
02:05:31,900 --> 02:05:33,900
Brush your teeth wash your butt

1723
02:05:34,380 --> 02:05:38,860
And if you ever need that extra clean feeling you can use

1724
02:05:39,900 --> 02:05:44,380
Water on your toilet paper and it essentially acts as a wet wipe. Yeah

1725
02:05:45,180 --> 02:05:47,180
and then you don't have to you know

1726
02:05:47,900 --> 02:05:50,300
Cause issues in your plumbing system by using like

1727
02:05:51,020 --> 02:05:53,580
Cotton L wipes or something or baby wipes

1728
02:05:54,220 --> 02:05:59,340
Yep, and if you're a little bougie you could put rose water on your toilet paper and then

1729
02:06:00,540 --> 02:06:04,380
Or witch hazel which acts as an astringent and it doesn't burn

1730
02:06:05,100 --> 02:06:07,100
Very true. Very true. Or you can get a bidet

1731
02:06:07,900 --> 02:06:10,300
Or you could get a bidet. I want to try to get a bidet

1732
02:06:10,380 --> 02:06:13,180
I don't I couldn't I probably want to be able to install it in my apartment

1733
02:06:13,660 --> 02:06:15,660
But it'd be really cool to have a bidet

1734
02:06:15,820 --> 02:06:18,940
It would just shoot water up right up my butt

1735
02:06:21,260 --> 02:06:23,260
Like like galaga

1736
02:06:23,660 --> 02:06:30,300
Oh, no, I don't joker. That's why you double up the toilet paper. Oh, yeah, what you want to yeah

1737
02:06:30,300 --> 02:06:34,780
You want to fold that up a couple times before you get you don't want to do like one single square

1738
02:06:35,660 --> 02:06:37,660
Yeah, who does that?

1739
02:06:37,740 --> 02:06:39,740
I know somebody who does that

1740
02:06:40,620 --> 02:06:44,380
What am I friends? I remember sleeping over her house

1741
02:06:44,940 --> 02:06:49,100
And she's like, oh, can you grab me a square toilet paper? Like I'm out of toilet. I'm like a square

1742
02:06:50,300 --> 02:06:51,820
A square

1743
02:06:51,820 --> 02:06:57,100
How do you know a square is not going to keep your hands clean you got to double that shit up exactly

1744
02:06:57,500 --> 02:06:58,860
I

1745
02:06:58,860 --> 02:07:00,860
I questioned our friendship after that

1746
02:07:01,420 --> 02:07:02,620
honestly

1747
02:07:02,620 --> 02:07:07,020
Like don't fall for the charnel bears or the shaman bear propaganda

1748
02:07:07,260 --> 02:07:13,340
You use as much toilet paper as you want you bought it. I think it was because she grew up mostly in a house full of boys

1749
02:07:14,540 --> 02:07:18,140
And for boys like they don't really like when they pee they don't wipe

1750
02:07:19,020 --> 02:07:21,020
Or they just like do a little shake

1751
02:07:21,100 --> 02:07:25,580
No boys don't wipe. Yeah, they have to do that shake and then you got to wonder like well

1752
02:07:25,580 --> 02:07:31,020
What didn't it be effective if they did do like a little dab? Yeah, I think that's she got the dab from that

1753
02:07:33,340 --> 02:07:34,700
It's

1754
02:07:34,700 --> 02:07:38,940
Yeah, you got a little then you got a little piss stain on your pants, especially if you were in sweatpants

1755
02:07:39,660 --> 02:07:43,500
Yeah, and then it just makes like makes it look like you didn't like make it in time. Yeah

1756
02:07:44,780 --> 02:07:49,500
And that's kind of sad if you think about it like at least when a girl doesn't make it in time

1757
02:07:49,660 --> 02:07:51,660
It's kind of like hell. Yeah

1758
02:07:54,780 --> 02:08:01,260
But the smell is there, but we can cover that up too. It's a little perfume bath and potty wars

1759
02:08:05,500 --> 02:08:10,140
That's why your kegel exercises are very important to keep you from pissing when you sneeze

1760
02:08:11,100 --> 02:08:13,100
Like and it's weird because I didn't

1761
02:08:13,820 --> 02:08:18,780
When I was sneezing the uh, I don't is that what you're referencing right now? Yeah, okay. Um

1762
02:08:20,140 --> 02:08:23,980
I'm like just I just suddenly feel personally attacked to be funny if you weren't even talking about that

1763
02:08:24,940 --> 02:08:29,420
It wasn't because it happened it happens to me too because like when you get older you think

1764
02:08:29,420 --> 02:08:32,700
Oh, nothing bad's ever gonna happen to me and then next thing you know

1765
02:08:32,780 --> 02:08:37,420
You're sneezing and like lord help you if it happens to be like one of those days of the month

1766
02:08:37,980 --> 02:08:39,980
And oh, that's the worst

1767
02:08:40,540 --> 02:08:42,540
And then you're like a gusher and then you're just

1768
02:08:43,180 --> 02:08:49,020
You're just call. Yeah, call me your little ketchup packet when I sneeze. I swear to god. Um

1769
02:08:51,020 --> 02:08:53,500
Um, no, it wasn't even pee

1770
02:09:00,380 --> 02:09:02,380
You know

1771
02:09:02,620 --> 02:09:04,620
That's fine

1772
02:09:05,100 --> 02:09:10,460
That's fine. You know, the body is full of mysterious substances. Yeah

1773
02:09:11,420 --> 02:09:13,740
We could basically say that it was sprinkles

1774
02:09:14,380 --> 02:09:16,380
sparkles

1775
02:09:16,380 --> 02:09:18,380
Rainbows at this point

1776
02:09:18,540 --> 02:09:20,540
Like

1777
02:09:24,620 --> 02:09:31,020
Like honestly, I'm still trying to figure out if the human body could essentially work like a straw

1778
02:09:33,820 --> 02:09:35,020
I wonder

1779
02:09:35,020 --> 02:09:37,020
Oh, can you do like

1780
02:09:37,580 --> 02:09:40,860
Did you see that like clip of like the girls doing kegel exercises?

1781
02:09:41,740 --> 02:09:43,980
And they're pulling up stuff through this. Yeah

1782
02:09:45,020 --> 02:09:47,020
I want to try that

1783
02:09:48,380 --> 02:09:50,380
I

1784
02:09:51,660 --> 02:09:53,660
Would you ever try that

1785
02:09:53,900 --> 02:09:58,380
I would but I don't think I could do it. I don't have the pelvic wall string

1786
02:09:59,100 --> 02:10:00,780
I'm practicing right now

1787
02:10:00,780 --> 02:10:01,900
one

1788
02:10:01,900 --> 02:10:02,940
two

1789
02:10:02,940 --> 02:10:03,980
two three

1790
02:10:03,980 --> 02:10:06,140
three four four hold it

1791
02:10:08,220 --> 02:10:10,220
Release

1792
02:10:10,940 --> 02:10:22,060
I hope you did it. I hope you did it with us harlot. Yeah, you better

1793
02:10:22,860 --> 02:10:26,620
You'll have to go back and you'll have to do it all over again. Exactly

1794
02:10:31,740 --> 02:10:34,620
And remember if you're clenching your butt, you're doing it wrong

1795
02:10:34,940 --> 02:10:36,940
Um

1796
02:10:38,380 --> 02:10:42,940
But yeah, no, yeah guys can do it too. It just makes your your little pee pee bounce

1797
02:10:45,020 --> 02:10:50,540
Yeah, and like it's okay because you guys have that button in the backside. Yeah to help

1798
02:10:51,420 --> 02:10:53,580
Doesn't it like strengthen their prostate or something?

1799
02:10:54,380 --> 02:10:59,340
Yeah, it does. I think also, I don't know if I told you this really interesting fact

1800
02:10:59,740 --> 02:11:03,020
What so there there's a scientific method of like

1801
02:11:03,980 --> 02:11:05,980
Undoing hiccups

1802
02:11:06,220 --> 02:11:10,220
That has been proven and you'll never guess how is it doing

1803
02:11:11,100 --> 02:11:12,620
Kegels

1804
02:11:12,620 --> 02:11:17,740
No, no, no, it's actually a lot easier than doing kegels. Okay. You just got to put a finger up your butt

1805
02:11:18,700 --> 02:11:19,900
What?

1806
02:11:19,900 --> 02:11:23,260
Yep, if you put a finger up your butt it helps you stop the hiccups

1807
02:11:24,780 --> 02:11:26,780
How

1808
02:11:26,860 --> 02:11:32,540
Well, see there's a thing in your in your in your in your rectal space. Okay, I guess kind of push

1809
02:11:33,020 --> 02:11:40,300
It's not fake. You can google it. You can google it. It's there are there are there are there are there are findings

1810
02:11:41,100 --> 02:11:42,380
scientific finding

1811
02:11:42,380 --> 02:11:44,380
This is how I got my friends

1812
02:11:44,540 --> 02:11:46,540
Okay, so are you guys saying it's true?

1813
02:11:47,180 --> 02:11:49,180
Very interesting

1814
02:11:50,780 --> 02:11:52,780
I know lots of stuff

1815
02:11:52,780 --> 02:11:54,780
That's how I know

1816
02:11:54,780 --> 02:11:55,660
Oh

1817
02:11:55,660 --> 02:11:58,380
She does know lots of stuff. I'm being so educated right now

1818
02:11:59,100 --> 02:12:03,740
Honestly, it's a mystery what I know. I don't even know what I know until I tell people

1819
02:12:04,940 --> 02:12:06,380
It just comes up

1820
02:12:06,380 --> 02:12:11,420
I know that happens to me sometimes too just have random facts and I'm just like why did I say

1821
02:12:12,380 --> 02:12:14,380
But it's really prevalent

1822
02:12:14,380 --> 02:12:21,100
I can't tell you when the war of 1812 took place, but I can tell you that scooby-doo was created on september 1969

1823
02:12:21,100 --> 02:12:28,300
That's a more important fact

1824
02:12:29,420 --> 02:12:31,420
See it's important to know

1825
02:12:34,380 --> 02:12:39,900
1812 a fire call when the war of 1812 took place

1826
02:12:45,900 --> 02:12:48,780
Yeah, but when in 1812, I don't know

1827
02:12:51,100 --> 02:12:53,100
I

1828
02:12:55,980 --> 02:12:59,020
Yeah, you shove your finger up your butt to scare the hiccups away

1829
02:13:00,940 --> 02:13:02,940
Because everybody knows the hiccups come from the butt

1830
02:13:13,660 --> 02:13:15,660
I'm gonna try that next time I get hiccups

1831
02:13:16,620 --> 02:13:20,780
My fingers going up my butt and I'll tell you if guys if it works

1832
02:13:24,540 --> 02:13:26,540
Someone else's butt no you don't do that

1833
02:13:28,060 --> 02:13:33,660
Could you imagine though if we were on the magic school bus and it taught history instead of science and we went back in time

1834
02:13:35,340 --> 02:13:38,940
That would be so cool actually if they had like a magic school bus equivalent for that

1835
02:13:39,980 --> 02:13:41,980
Yeah, I like history

1836
02:13:42,220 --> 02:13:46,220
How come miss frizzle only taught science actually? Yeah, well they had

1837
02:13:47,100 --> 02:13:51,660
So many other subjects you need to learn in school and they were young enough that they only had one teacher

1838
02:13:52,460 --> 02:13:54,460
Yeah, she only taught science

1839
02:13:55,100 --> 02:13:58,380
Why wasn't she teaching like math or english or

1840
02:13:59,500 --> 02:14:06,620
Anything else like we had a music episode, but that was science adjacent. Yeah, they definitely should have taken her teaching license away

1841
02:14:07,580 --> 02:14:14,620
Also, I don't think any of these children's parents knew that they were leaving school in the middle of the day and going into like someone's body

1842
02:14:15,340 --> 02:14:18,620
Then they like travel into someone's body at one point on the bus

1843
02:14:19,900 --> 02:14:23,340
More than once don't they need like a parents permission slip for that?

1844
02:14:24,300 --> 02:14:26,300
nah

1845
02:14:26,460 --> 02:14:28,460
Don't they need consent to

1846
02:14:30,780 --> 02:14:35,660
I mean the child's at school that's consent enough for them to fly a bus into the child, right?

1847
02:14:37,260 --> 02:14:46,620
Well, actually no because they flew up. They flew the bus into Ralphie's sick body. Yeah, how can he consent to that? That's not fair

1848
02:14:48,220 --> 02:14:54,780
Well, I guess Ralphie said it was okay because he's like you guys are going inside me and miss frizzle's like yep

1849
02:14:55,260 --> 02:14:56,460
well

1850
02:14:56,460 --> 02:14:58,460
I feel like he felt like he didn't have a choice then

1851
02:14:59,500 --> 02:15:05,340
And you know, it's fucked up Ralphie's mom in that episode we find out that her like profession is she's a doctor

1852
02:15:05,820 --> 02:15:07,820
What a shitty doctor

1853
02:15:10,460 --> 02:15:12,460
So she doesn't

1854
02:15:12,780 --> 02:15:16,620
So she's like so like she even sees them inside of Ralphie's body

1855
02:15:16,620 --> 02:15:21,580
And she doesn't put two and two together because she's like wow this actually looks like the inside of a body

1856
02:15:21,900 --> 02:15:25,660
I can't believe your classmates put this together for you so you can learn how you're sick

1857
02:15:26,060 --> 02:15:29,820
Maybe it's a little too much excitement though. We should probably turn this off

1858
02:15:30,060 --> 02:15:32,060
Just

1859
02:15:32,620 --> 02:15:34,460
Gaslighting her son

1860
02:15:34,460 --> 02:15:38,140
Maybe she was gaslighting herself. Oh, yeah, the kid that almost died in space

1861
02:15:38,940 --> 02:15:41,420
Yep, that was Arnold. Take Arnold. Yeah, I was an Andrew

1862
02:15:43,340 --> 02:15:45,340
And then you had like the narc phoebe

1863
02:15:46,060 --> 02:15:48,060
Oh, I hated phoebe

1864
02:15:48,140 --> 02:15:53,100
They never did this at my old school. Bitch. You ain't at your old school. And we don't know why

1865
02:15:55,740 --> 02:15:58,060
Are you gonna expel because of how annoying you are

1866
02:15:59,020 --> 02:16:03,180
Fuck it. Phoebe. Fuck it's Phoebe, man. Carlos

1867
02:16:04,700 --> 02:16:07,100
Carlton is terrible puns

1868
02:16:12,220 --> 02:16:14,220
And then you had Tim who could draw

1869
02:16:15,420 --> 02:16:17,980
That was his that was this thing that was this thing

1870
02:16:18,780 --> 02:16:23,180
Yep, and then you had Keisha who was a good journalist. She was pretty good

1871
02:16:23,900 --> 02:16:25,900
I thought Keisha was cool

1872
02:16:25,900 --> 02:16:32,620
Yeah, Keisha was real cool. Arnold's now wanda. I wanted to wanda wanda fighting the fighting the curb in 4k

1873
02:16:33,420 --> 02:16:35,900
Every other episode they killed Arnold's cousin

1874
02:16:37,260 --> 02:16:39,020
wait

1875
02:16:39,020 --> 02:16:40,460
They killed janet

1876
02:16:40,460 --> 02:16:41,900
I hated janet

1877
02:16:41,900 --> 02:16:43,900
Janet was real annoying

1878
02:16:43,900 --> 02:16:47,740
Arnold's cousin almost rat the class out to the police and then they killed her was

1879
02:16:51,260 --> 02:16:54,300
I believe it too. I kind of want that to be canon

1880
02:16:56,380 --> 02:17:01,260
And then of course you have dorthian girl with two names bit of a no at all. Yeah

1881
02:17:03,980 --> 02:17:08,140
What a what a what a ride that show was I know

1882
02:17:10,940 --> 02:17:16,060
I wish I could be on the magic school bus. Yeah despite everything I wish I could be there too

1883
02:17:17,820 --> 02:17:19,820
I think

1884
02:17:19,820 --> 02:17:22,220
I'm trying to think of like what our character types would be

1885
02:17:23,180 --> 02:17:26,700
Hmm. Well, it is a short bus. So that's money

1886
02:17:30,380 --> 02:17:35,020
I'll be the really dumb blonde that doesn't understand what's going on

1887
02:17:36,860 --> 02:17:40,300
I'll be the one that thinks of way too many things that don't

1888
02:17:41,020 --> 02:17:43,020
pertain to the moment

1889
02:17:43,340 --> 02:17:49,180
You're just like they're like in his body and you're just like did you know that plants and they're like shut up trick

1890
02:17:53,180 --> 02:17:57,260
Ah, you just say the most inopportune facts at the wrong time

1891
02:17:58,380 --> 02:18:01,500
Did you know more people die because they wear their seatbelts?

1892
02:18:05,020 --> 02:18:10,380
Everybody on the bus just takes off their seatbelt seatbelts everyone and then you just say that

1893
02:18:15,420 --> 02:18:21,660
Horror theory is interesting on the magic school bus. Is there a creepypasta of that? I bet there is

1894
02:18:22,220 --> 02:18:24,220
Look, there's so many

1895
02:18:24,300 --> 02:18:26,140
Like I think like around last year

1896
02:18:26,140 --> 02:18:28,380
I stumbled upon the tiktok series where they were

1897
02:18:29,180 --> 02:18:32,380
Introducing like the magic school bus as a horror based theme and like

1898
02:18:33,100 --> 02:18:38,700
Every every field trip somebody would die, but they would be reincarnated by the end of the adventure. Oh my gosh

1899
02:18:40,780 --> 02:18:44,540
That is to miss frizzle just like some sort of crazy witch

1900
02:18:45,580 --> 02:18:48,860
Honestly, okay. So talking about I'm so sorry

1901
02:18:49,580 --> 02:18:54,380
Can I can I tell you about mary poppins? Yes, you could tell me about mary poppins

1902
02:18:55,340 --> 02:19:03,580
Okay, so you know how I also love mary poppins and you are aware that they came up with a mary poppins to mary poppins returns, right?

1903
02:19:03,820 --> 02:19:05,820
Yes, I remember watching that with my mom

1904
02:19:06,300 --> 02:19:08,300
Okay, mary poppins 2

1905
02:19:08,300 --> 02:19:13,900
Pisses me off right because it is seen for seen original mary poppins except now mary poppins

1906
02:19:14,060 --> 02:19:19,500
Now that she has like CGI magic instead of like practical effect magic feels more like a demon

1907
02:19:19,820 --> 02:19:25,740
Who's come back to feel some contractual agreement that she has with the bank's children

1908
02:19:27,740 --> 02:19:29,180
That

1909
02:19:29,180 --> 02:19:31,180
That actually makes so much sense

1910
02:19:31,740 --> 02:19:36,540
Because there's that scene like towards the end of the movie where we're already past like the point of hype

1911
02:19:36,860 --> 02:19:41,260
And they're like, oh no, we have to get up to the top of big Ben to stall time

1912
02:19:41,740 --> 02:19:46,620
And so you see all these lamp lighters making their way on the BMX bikes

1913
02:19:47,100 --> 02:19:52,860
Ladder to shit climbing on the outside of big Ben and mary poppins is standing there cool as a cucumber

1914
02:19:53,100 --> 02:19:58,460
And like she finally gets fed up like never seen humans to do a woman. She's not human

1915
02:19:59,020 --> 02:20:01,020
She's a demon

1916
02:20:01,180 --> 02:20:03,820
At that point and then she flies up with her umbrella

1917
02:20:03,900 --> 02:20:10,460
You see her silhouette and I'm like, bitch you could have done that the whole time and save these people like death because I'm pretty sure

1918
02:20:10,860 --> 02:20:14,620
Almost five of them fell off the tower that is big Ben

1919
02:20:15,260 --> 02:20:18,220
That would make a lot of sense because then as a demon she would just

1920
02:20:19,340 --> 02:20:21,580
Like to see humans suffer from time to time

1921
02:20:22,140 --> 02:20:24,140
And she does see humans suffer

1922
02:20:24,300 --> 02:20:29,500
She actively does see them suffer and then she likes to punish them especially when they're kids

1923
02:20:30,300 --> 02:20:31,820
and kind of like

1924
02:20:31,820 --> 02:20:35,260
Because think about like the medicine they didn't want to eat the medicine. She kind of like tortures them even

1925
02:20:36,220 --> 02:20:40,780
Yeah, because like you can even tell that she's not really there for the children to learn a lesson

1926
02:20:40,940 --> 02:20:46,140
No, the actual children. No, she's there for michael and jane because jane's almost like a spinster

1927
02:20:46,220 --> 02:20:51,660
She's like, I don't really want to date anyone mary poppins mary poppins sets her up with lynn manwell maranda

1928
02:20:53,020 --> 02:20:55,980
And then out of everybody, you know, that's your torture. No

1929
02:20:57,020 --> 02:21:02,620
And then like for michael, she's like you need to get over your dead wife. You have children my guy

1930
02:21:03,420 --> 02:21:05,420
i'ma help you

1931
02:21:05,500 --> 02:21:07,260
understand this

1932
02:21:07,260 --> 02:21:10,540
That you need to be the adult and they need to not be the adult

1933
02:21:11,340 --> 02:21:15,500
Well, what what would be what would be the the narrative with the chimney sweep?

1934
02:21:16,940 --> 02:21:21,660
So the chimney sweep is lynn manwell maranda is taking on the role of burt

1935
02:21:22,380 --> 02:21:24,460
In this movie, but what about like normal burt?

1936
02:21:25,580 --> 02:21:27,180
normal burt

1937
02:21:27,180 --> 02:21:28,700
What would be the

1938
02:21:28,700 --> 02:21:30,700
the story between them that he like

1939
02:21:31,340 --> 02:21:33,340
Fallen was she like a succubus?

1940
02:21:34,060 --> 02:21:36,060
so the way that I see it right

1941
02:21:36,860 --> 02:21:39,020
Is in the very first mary poppins movie

1942
02:21:39,660 --> 02:21:46,700
mary poppins has been to london before and she's known burt since she was like a younger sort of demon slash witch

1943
02:21:47,100 --> 02:21:52,940
And they sort of have like this sort of coexistence things because burt's got a little tricky magic of his own

1944
02:21:53,420 --> 02:21:56,460
True, but he can't really do it because he's not really a fully

1945
02:21:57,260 --> 02:22:02,860
Realized or or a wizard of some bro. I imagine they do like sabrina the teenage witch like they do with netflix

1946
02:22:03,100 --> 02:22:07,820
Except they do mary poppins and they make like a darker mary poppins when she was younger

1947
02:22:08,460 --> 02:22:13,820
You know what this disney's missing out because I have a million great ideas

1948
02:22:15,100 --> 02:22:17,600
They need to hire you. This is brilliant

1949
02:22:18,160 --> 02:22:22,800
I love that so much

1950
02:22:23,760 --> 02:22:26,720
Pennywise feeds on fear poppins feeds on joy

1951
02:22:28,160 --> 02:22:32,160
I don't even you know what I don't even think poppins feeds on joy

1952
02:22:32,800 --> 02:22:35,280
She feeds on what is considered obedience

1953
02:22:36,480 --> 02:22:43,520
Essentially obedience turning people into societal members and also teaching good family values

1954
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:47,280
Because it takes place in britain even though they don't have british accents

1955
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
Yeah, good point

1956
02:22:51,840 --> 02:22:56,480
Because like mary poppins could care less about women's suffrage in the first movie. Yeah, good

1957
02:22:57,360 --> 02:22:59,360
Yeah, she was just like whatever

1958
02:22:59,520 --> 02:23:06,000
Whatever, I don't I don't need to vote human laws don't really affect me. Yeah, she's like I've seen centuries of this

1959
02:23:08,160 --> 02:23:10,480
It all it all turns out the same

1960
02:23:10,480 --> 02:23:12,480
Hmm

1961
02:23:12,720 --> 02:23:20,080
Women go on having children men go to work and they neglect their kids. I'm here to teach you. Don't neglect your kids. Yep

1962
02:23:21,040 --> 02:23:23,040
I like this theory. This sounds very legit

1963
02:23:28,400 --> 02:23:33,200
Sorry, we went we went we went on a weird sort of roundabout from winnie the pooh

1964
02:23:34,480 --> 02:23:36,800
To magic school bus to mary poppins

1965
02:23:36,800 --> 02:23:38,800
Mm-hmm

1966
02:23:38,800 --> 02:23:42,000
We should just I like how we just have like lengthy discussions about

1967
02:23:42,800 --> 02:23:44,800
children's movies and shows and how they

1968
02:23:45,680 --> 02:23:49,280
See just conspiracy stream about how they're secretly all twisted

1969
02:23:51,200 --> 02:23:53,200
Analyze them

1970
02:23:54,160 --> 02:23:56,160
I'm a bit of a conspiracy theorist

1971
02:23:56,960 --> 02:24:01,520
I like it though. Are we all we should we should they're all we should all should uh, you know

1972
02:24:02,320 --> 02:24:06,400
Humor a little bit of conspiracy every now and then a little bit. Sometimes it's the truth

1973
02:24:07,520 --> 02:24:12,320
Yeah, like did you guys know that there's a genre of music that's devoted to flat earth?

1974
02:24:13,440 --> 02:24:14,880
What?

1975
02:24:14,880 --> 02:24:22,160
Yeah, what's it called listing is it good flat earth. It's honestly flat earth got some bops to it. Okay

1976
02:24:22,880 --> 02:24:24,880
all right

1977
02:24:26,160 --> 02:24:30,960
Trinket 15 minute rambles are impressive. This is why we're good friends because we're both just yappers

1978
02:24:32,880 --> 02:24:34,880
She's the only one that can match my yap

1979
02:24:37,200 --> 02:24:39,520
I can yapp as long as someone yaps with me

1980
02:24:41,760 --> 02:24:46,480
Flatcore oh my god, I mean they're bops

1981
02:24:48,480 --> 02:24:50,880
Oh, Mary and peter pan are the same

1982
02:24:51,920 --> 02:24:55,200
What explain elaborate on the peter pan theory

1983
02:24:55,920 --> 02:25:04,960
Oh, okay. I see what they're going for so peter pan himself is a bit of a demon because he goes and he kidnaps children from open windows

1984
02:25:05,280 --> 02:25:06,320
True

1985
02:25:06,320 --> 02:25:08,320
Because he he gives them this lie

1986
02:25:08,720 --> 02:25:13,120
You can come with me and never grow up, but that's not necessarily true for children that go with him

1987
02:25:13,680 --> 02:25:20,560
Because they do eventually grow up and when they grow up in neverland they turn into pirates in which peter pan kills pirates

1988
02:25:21,280 --> 02:25:24,160
And he's just constantly feeding himself

1989
02:25:25,440 --> 02:25:27,440
Whatever sick twisted

1990
02:25:28,080 --> 02:25:30,080
Joy he gets out of killing pirates

1991
02:25:30,640 --> 02:25:32,640
Oh my god

1992
02:25:33,280 --> 02:25:40,480
And then here's here's another good one for you when he's actually going to uh the the window of the darlings where windy

1993
02:25:41,280 --> 02:25:42,400
john

1994
02:25:42,400 --> 02:25:44,000
and

1995
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,640
Windy john and never got the other one

1996
02:25:47,360 --> 02:25:50,800
I forget him too. Anyways, michael there it is. Yeah michael

1997
02:25:51,680 --> 02:25:57,120
So when when he goes to that window, he's been there a few times because he loves listening to windy tales stories

1998
02:25:57,680 --> 02:26:03,200
But there's not an opportunity for him to kind of slip in and steal the children because they're perfectly happy

1999
02:26:03,200 --> 02:26:05,040
They have no reason to run away from home

2000
02:26:05,040 --> 02:26:12,320
Yep, until like that night when the father's fed up because a dog shouldn't be a nanny that don't don't let anyone ever tell you otherwise

2001
02:26:12,320 --> 02:26:17,840
I would make a great nanny. I am a dog. She would be a great nanny. I will watch I will watch your children for you

2002
02:26:18,080 --> 02:26:20,320
Yeah, and then I'll take a nap. Yep

2003
02:26:21,680 --> 02:26:24,240
So anyways, peter pan sneaks into the house, right? Yeah

2004
02:26:24,240 --> 02:26:27,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah because because his shadow gets away from him anyways

2005
02:26:28,080 --> 02:26:30,400
So that's like the reason why he goes in. Yeah

2006
02:26:31,360 --> 02:26:35,600
Yeah, so he goes in wendy's like, oh my god. There's a boy in my room

2007
02:26:36,960 --> 02:26:38,640
Peter pans like

2008
02:26:38,640 --> 02:26:41,520
Well, yeah, but i'm here for my shadow. Oh

2009
02:26:42,080 --> 02:26:43,200
well

2010
02:26:43,200 --> 02:26:49,120
I can help you stick it back because he was trying to stick his shadow back on with soap at first because you know soap's kind of sticky

2011
02:26:49,120 --> 02:26:53,200
So yeah, a little bit sticky. It's not that smart. He's not that smart because it also can be slippery

2012
02:26:53,920 --> 02:26:56,720
Yeah, and so she's like, I'll just sew it on for you

2013
02:26:56,880 --> 02:27:00,800
And of course wendy's getting fresh because she's about to hit that puberty streak and she's like

2014
02:27:01,360 --> 02:27:03,840
I'll give you a kiss and he's like, okay

2015
02:27:04,240 --> 02:27:08,560
And she and he's like hold out his hand. She gives him a thimble, of course, and you know, but

2016
02:27:09,440 --> 02:27:13,680
Then she's like, okay, then I'll give you a thimble and she's she's about the plant one on him

2017
02:27:13,840 --> 02:27:20,560
Of course and then tinker bell a little the little demon that that stole peter pan away. She is fey. She is fey

2018
02:27:21,120 --> 02:27:23,280
He is fey. So is peter pan a changeling?

2019
02:27:24,400 --> 02:27:28,080
Peter pan would be a changeling because he was human and then he was

2020
02:27:28,480 --> 02:27:32,480
Abducted by fairies because he ran away from his parents when he was still a baby

2021
02:27:32,880 --> 02:27:39,040
Because they were they were talking his future way too early above him. Yeah, like that's how you give a baby anxiety

2022
02:27:39,360 --> 02:27:41,520
Oh, we'll visit the finest schools

2023
02:27:42,240 --> 02:27:43,840
Yardsdale

2024
02:27:43,840 --> 02:27:49,680
Princeton and he'll join his father in the courts and it's like, ah, he just couldn't handle that

2025
02:27:50,320 --> 02:27:52,320
Yeah, so

2026
02:27:52,800 --> 02:27:57,680
He goes to neverland. He grows up there. He develops his own sort of magic because yeah, peter pan doesn't need

2027
02:27:58,640 --> 02:28:00,800
Yeah, peter pan doesn't need fairy dust

2028
02:28:01,360 --> 02:28:04,640
To like fly he makes his own now because he's imbued with magic

2029
02:28:04,800 --> 02:28:09,680
Yeah, because he's been there for so long since like right only happens when you're young. I bet

2030
02:28:10,400 --> 02:28:12,800
Huh, that's really interesting then because like why didn't

2031
02:28:13,920 --> 02:28:15,680
some of the kids

2032
02:28:15,680 --> 02:28:17,280
get the same

2033
02:28:17,280 --> 02:28:19,280
ability as him

2034
02:28:19,280 --> 02:28:22,480
Because they're always changing out because they always grow up

2035
02:28:23,760 --> 02:28:25,760
What stops him from growing up?

2036
02:28:26,160 --> 02:28:27,040
well

2037
02:28:27,040 --> 02:28:29,040
Because he was the first

2038
02:28:30,320 --> 02:28:35,600
He and neverland are kind of tied together now neverland's attached to him. He's attached to neverland

2039
02:28:35,840 --> 02:28:40,480
That's why whenever he leaves neverland if it's frozen over. It's cold. It's dead

2040
02:28:40,960 --> 02:28:45,280
And then when he returns the sun is back. It's warm. It's summer. You do fun stuff

2041
02:28:45,280 --> 02:28:47,920
I can't live without him and he can't live without neverland

2042
02:28:48,640 --> 02:28:50,160
Right

2043
02:28:50,160 --> 02:28:52,160
Fascinating

2044
02:28:52,240 --> 02:28:55,040
So anyway peter pan is in the same

2045
02:28:55,680 --> 02:28:59,760
Like breath like mary poppins in that he

2046
02:29:00,480 --> 02:29:06,320
He doesn't really help children, but he steals children. Yeah, he's an entity that just does things on us on win

2047
02:29:07,120 --> 02:29:09,120
right and mary poppins is like

2048
02:29:10,560 --> 02:29:13,680
The one who comes to you for when she needs to eat

2049
02:29:14,800 --> 02:29:16,400
mm

2050
02:29:16,400 --> 02:29:19,920
Whereas with nanny mcfee nanny mcfee is just selfish

2051
02:29:21,440 --> 02:29:24,640
I used to love nanny mcfee that movie was so I love that movie

2052
02:29:25,280 --> 02:29:27,280
I love nanny mcfee nanny mcfee is

2053
02:29:27,920 --> 02:29:32,640
Like the saw the opposite side of mary poppins. Yes, just like more

2054
02:29:33,920 --> 02:29:35,920
hardcore

2055
02:29:37,520 --> 02:29:43,600
She she's like she's like when mary poppins fails to get the job done. She's the boot camp of equivalent of mary

2056
02:29:43,600 --> 02:29:45,200
Yeah

2057
02:29:45,200 --> 02:29:47,200
but she's not like

2058
02:29:47,920 --> 02:29:49,920
I wouldn't say she's a demon

2059
02:29:50,640 --> 02:29:52,880
No, she's not I would say just she's like a witch

2060
02:29:53,680 --> 02:30:00,160
Yeah, she's like a cursed hag. Yeah just gets off on like the more you hate me the longer I'll stay

2061
02:30:00,560 --> 02:30:03,680
Yeah, but when you want me I'll go away

2062
02:30:04,480 --> 02:30:06,480
It's like damn. Okay

2063
02:30:07,360 --> 02:30:09,360
Yeah, it's like it's and that's how you know

2064
02:30:10,080 --> 02:30:12,640
Because that's how witches are like a riddly like that

2065
02:30:13,600 --> 02:30:15,600
Yeah, yeah

2066
02:30:15,600 --> 02:30:17,600
Peter Pan is an s of scp

2067
02:30:21,040 --> 02:30:24,000
Yeah, I don't remember a lot of the nanny mcfee movie the second one

2068
02:30:24,800 --> 02:30:29,760
I don't remember the second one either, but I feel like it's not attached to the first one really

2069
02:30:31,360 --> 02:30:33,360
Oh, wait, really

2070
02:30:33,360 --> 02:30:36,960
It's a really good point. No, I'm going back to Peter Pan

2071
02:30:37,280 --> 02:30:40,800
Neverland takes the time from the children that he brings and gives it to Peter Pan

2072
02:30:41,680 --> 02:30:47,760
That would make a million dollars worth of cents. Mm-hmm. He's stealing time from them

2073
02:30:49,600 --> 02:30:51,600
Boy Robin Williams version

2074
02:30:52,320 --> 02:31:00,080
Oh, I do love the Robin Williams version. Yeah, where he goes back like because like even in the storybook like the original

2075
02:31:00,800 --> 02:31:05,120
M.M. Berry Peter Pan storybook, which by the way fun fact about Peter Pan

2076
02:31:05,360 --> 02:31:07,360
It is not actually public domain

2077
02:31:07,760 --> 02:31:14,400
Any money that you make off of Peter Pan should go to the children's hospital because the rights are owned by a children's hospital

2078
02:31:14,480 --> 02:31:16,480
That's really cool

2079
02:31:16,480 --> 02:31:22,080
But a lot of people don't listen and do that. So, you know, it's kind of a hand wash at this point

2080
02:31:22,640 --> 02:31:23,760
but

2081
02:31:23,760 --> 02:31:25,760
I digress

2082
02:31:27,360 --> 02:31:29,360
I digress uh my point being

2083
02:31:30,400 --> 02:31:32,640
So with Peter Pan. Mm-hmm

2084
02:31:33,440 --> 02:31:35,760
Wait, hold on. What was I saying?

2085
02:31:36,960 --> 02:31:39,360
Oh, hook. Yeah, we were talking about hook

2086
02:31:39,600 --> 02:31:42,800
So it's really interesting because Peter Pan actually in the book

2087
02:31:43,280 --> 02:31:47,040
Takes Wendy's daughter Jane with her kind of like how

2088
02:31:47,680 --> 02:31:52,080
When Disney made Return to Neverland the sequel that does introduce you to the fact that

2089
02:31:52,480 --> 02:31:55,840
Wendy grows up and has a daughter named Jane. Yeah, you know in a son

2090
02:31:56,320 --> 02:31:59,360
and so he actually does take Jane to

2091
02:32:00,320 --> 02:32:03,760
Like Neverland and she becomes the very first quote-unquote lost girl

2092
02:32:03,920 --> 02:32:08,320
But when hook happens we we pass over Jane and we meet Moira

2093
02:32:10,720 --> 02:32:12,000
Who is

2094
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:16,160
Wendy's great granddaughter and Peter is just so enamored with love

2095
02:32:16,240 --> 02:32:19,760
He's like, I don't want to go back because he now has something

2096
02:32:20,320 --> 02:32:22,320
to stay for

2097
02:32:23,920 --> 02:32:27,440
It's kind of weird he just like goes after one daughter after the other

2098
02:32:28,400 --> 02:32:33,360
Well, because he wants to keep the bloodline coming to Neverland because they're great storytellers apparently

2099
02:32:33,600 --> 02:32:38,880
Yeah, but like when he when he finds that one and it gets like I I love using this the zing

2100
02:32:39,520 --> 02:32:41,280
the zing

2101
02:32:41,280 --> 02:32:43,760
You know the hotel Transylvania zing

2102
02:32:44,640 --> 02:32:51,760
Um, he's just like, yeah, no, I'm staying and then of course in in the hook timeline. It just goes all awry

2103
02:32:52,240 --> 02:32:53,360
Hmm

2104
02:32:53,360 --> 02:32:59,840
Now I will say my favorite rendition of peter pan is the live action peter pan that came out in like 2000

2105
02:33:00,400 --> 02:33:03,200
With that one boy jeremy with the focus aim is

2106
02:33:03,760 --> 02:33:06,560
Yeah, and the hot in the hot rendition of yeah

2107
02:33:07,600 --> 02:33:09,600
Yes, I like had this really weird like

2108
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:15,520
Romantic subplot between captain hook and wendy where captain hook was kind of oh wait. Do you mean the more recent one?

2109
02:33:16,400 --> 02:33:22,000
Um, no not pan because pan was dog stockwater. I didn't even watch that one

2110
02:33:22,960 --> 02:33:29,760
I have to it was it. Yeah, it's one of jeremy's something. Um, it would have been peter pan from 2003

2111
02:33:32,080 --> 02:33:37,760
Yes, yes. Oh, yeah, wait. Oh, yeah, jason eyes explain captain hook

2112
02:33:38,480 --> 02:33:41,120
And he was hot. Yeah, that's so true

2113
02:33:41,120 --> 02:33:46,960
And like honestly if if I were to put together like a peter pan watch along

2114
02:33:47,120 --> 02:33:50,560
I would show that peter pan from 2003 followed by hook

2115
02:33:51,760 --> 02:33:58,480
So true because that would be the best way to watch it because you kind of get like this nice fun story where it's like

2116
02:33:58,560 --> 02:34:00,560
Oh, okay, you get a really

2117
02:34:00,640 --> 02:34:04,400
Book accurate peter pan and then you get like fan fiction that is hook

2118
02:34:04,480 --> 02:34:11,920
Sorry, I'm staring at pictures of the movie because I'm like my memory is being jogged

2119
02:34:12,480 --> 02:34:14,000
I'm like, wow

2120
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,160
I love that. I do believe mr.

2121
02:34:17,120 --> 02:34:20,080
Mr. Smee was always played by

2122
02:34:20,800 --> 02:34:22,640
Yes, me

2123
02:34:22,640 --> 02:34:26,400
Let's see. Mr. Smee was always played by um, um, um

2124
02:34:27,440 --> 02:34:33,120
Uh, oh man. The name is the main the name is uh escaping me. I have no idea

2125
02:34:33,120 --> 02:34:39,120
Uh, he was he was eddie valiant in who frank roger rabbit. Oh

2126
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,000
You're right. Oh my god

2127
02:34:43,520 --> 02:34:44,640
It's just

2128
02:34:44,640 --> 02:34:51,280
He he plays a really good schnee. He does. You're not that's so and mario. You're right. Oh my god

2129
02:34:51,280 --> 02:34:54,800
He's also mario on the live action mario the first one

2130
02:34:55,600 --> 02:34:59,760
Oh, that one was so goofy drunk off his drunk off his ass. Yeah, essentially

2131
02:35:00,720 --> 02:35:08,960
But I don't think he placed me in the 2003 peter pan. I think he's gone by then. Yeah, I don't think he did. Um

2132
02:35:09,840 --> 02:35:15,200
Peter being the grim reaper neverland is the afterlife in a shadow was a demon following him

2133
02:35:16,720 --> 02:35:18,720
Interesting theory

2134
02:35:19,760 --> 02:35:25,520
Oh, uh to answer miss morgan, I've seen twisted the musical but miss shabby doesn't like musical

2135
02:35:25,840 --> 02:35:27,840
I don't like musicals

2136
02:35:30,160 --> 02:35:32,000
Yes, please do tell me

2137
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:38,320
Okay, so twisted is basically like a retelling of a laden, but it focuses on jafar more than it does a laden

2138
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:45,840
Really, it's actually a very good musical. I highly recommend it and I know you hate musicals

2139
02:35:45,920 --> 02:35:47,920
I know you do but

2140
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:52,240
It's star kid musicals are a are a are a fish of a different color

2141
02:35:52,480 --> 02:35:55,760
Like they are rainbow fish to me. Well, explain the plot to me

2142
02:35:56,560 --> 02:35:58,560
Okay elaborate further

2143
02:35:58,880 --> 02:36:00,880
so if you can't imagine

2144
02:36:00,960 --> 02:36:03,920
twisted takes place towards the beginning of

2145
02:36:04,720 --> 02:36:06,480
a laden essentially

2146
02:36:06,480 --> 02:36:12,240
But instead of jafar like being an asshole like he is in the original movie jafar is actually this well meaning

2147
02:36:12,720 --> 02:36:14,720
royal vizier who just wants to do

2148
02:36:15,600 --> 02:36:20,560
Good things for the kingdom, but everyone thinks that everything is his fault because he is the royal vizier

2149
02:36:20,960 --> 02:36:27,680
But he's taking up the mantle after a bunch of corrupt royal viziers who only believe in the golden rule that is

2150
02:36:28,800 --> 02:36:30,800
get paid

2151
02:36:31,520 --> 02:36:33,520
whereas jafar uh

2152
02:36:34,160 --> 02:36:40,880
Is more on the side of do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Okay interesting

2153
02:36:41,920 --> 02:36:49,200
Everyone is a is a bastardization of themselves including the princess who doesn't have a name. She just goes by princess. That's funny

2154
02:36:50,160 --> 02:36:53,280
You have captain of the guard who's really funny. He has

2155
02:36:55,120 --> 02:36:58,880
Um, you have a laden who is a 32 year old man

2156
02:37:01,680 --> 02:37:08,240
Who they make him really creepy and he just he's an asshole. He steals everything. Oh, I need to I need to look up pictures of

2157
02:37:09,680 --> 02:37:11,200
Yes

2158
02:37:11,200 --> 02:37:17,120
And honestly the acting is really good. I would love to just sit down and watch this with you

2159
02:37:19,840 --> 02:37:23,200
And you also find out the jafar had a loving wife who he loved

2160
02:37:23,760 --> 02:37:29,200
Based off of charizard. You know the uh story teller of a thousand and one

2161
02:37:29,920 --> 02:37:30,640
night

2162
02:37:30,640 --> 02:37:36,240
Sorry, I'm looking at the cast pictures and this is goofy. Wait, is this supposed is this right by the same person who wrote wicked?

2163
02:37:37,280 --> 02:37:41,200
Not wicked. No because it looks they have the same exact

2164
02:37:42,160 --> 02:37:43,520
like

2165
02:37:43,520 --> 02:37:48,000
Cover it's sort of a it's sort of a play on wicked whereas wicked. I do like wicked

2166
02:37:48,080 --> 02:37:50,320
I did watch wicked wicked. It's like the only musical way

2167
02:37:51,280 --> 02:37:53,280
And lion king was very good

2168
02:37:53,440 --> 02:37:55,920
Uh, then I think you would absolutely adore

2169
02:37:56,720 --> 02:38:00,080
Twisted all right. I might have we might have to watch that together then

2170
02:38:01,120 --> 02:38:08,320
Yes, and it's on youtube like the whole thing. Oh sick. Okay, perfect because star kid always puts their musicals on youtube

2171
02:38:09,200 --> 02:38:10,400
All right

2172
02:38:10,400 --> 02:38:17,040
I might be able to stomach a musical because the plot is very intriguing and again. I do like cool twists on

2173
02:38:18,480 --> 02:38:22,880
Already told stories like that. So I really liked wicked for the reason. I can't wait for the wicked movie to come out

2174
02:38:23,680 --> 02:38:26,320
also a really good thing about uh

2175
02:38:27,360 --> 02:38:32,320
About twisted is you know how in Aladdin like the movie Aladdin like the cartoon

2176
02:38:32,720 --> 02:38:37,040
there's like that prince who's like a throwaway gag where he goes to meet the princess and

2177
02:38:37,760 --> 02:38:43,680
Jasmine sticks her tiger upon him and yeah, and all you remember is like he has funny boxers and he's just storming back to

2178
02:38:43,760 --> 02:38:45,920
Oh, yeah, because it frips his pants off. Yeah

2179
02:38:46,800 --> 02:38:50,480
He actually is a character a likeable character with a likeable song

2180
02:38:51,840 --> 02:38:57,120
They give him a whole like it's so funny when like sometimes uh spin-offs like elaborate

2181
02:38:57,280 --> 02:39:00,640
Unusually like throw away at like NPC like characters

2182
02:39:01,200 --> 02:39:03,360
It's then they give him some backstory. I love that

2183
02:39:04,960 --> 02:39:06,960
Oh my god

2184
02:39:07,520 --> 02:39:12,240
He's a huge plot point and twisted. I don't know so many of you guys like musicals

2185
02:39:12,880 --> 02:39:14,880
I

2186
02:39:14,880 --> 02:39:20,000
Love musicals. Oh my my my audience likes musicals too. Apparently. I'm very surprised

2187
02:39:20,560 --> 02:39:24,000
I can I can introduce you to some that you might actually like

2188
02:39:26,720 --> 02:39:27,920
Oh like

2189
02:39:27,920 --> 02:39:32,320
I don't know if I don't know if you've ever given it a try but uh, I'll give Roger and

2190
02:39:32,720 --> 02:39:37,600
Roger and Hammerstein Cinderella with brandy and Whitney Houston's pretty good. Oh

2191
02:39:38,320 --> 02:39:41,280
Don't even get me. I had that movie on

2192
02:39:42,400 --> 02:39:44,400
I loved that movie

2193
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:48,000
I love brandy cinderella

2194
02:39:48,720 --> 02:39:50,720
Oh my god

2195
02:39:51,120 --> 02:39:54,720
Of course, I'm a I'm a black girl. How could I not like this?

2196
02:39:59,840 --> 02:40:01,840
So good

2197
02:40:02,480 --> 02:40:05,040
Oh my god, I forgot that that was technically a musical

2198
02:40:05,600 --> 02:40:09,120
I think I didn't mind them as much when I was a kid now. I'm just like I'm irritated

2199
02:40:09,120 --> 02:40:16,400
I had I had I had my boss described to her co to her grandson because we went to go see wonka during christmas

2200
02:40:16,800 --> 02:40:23,520
That a musical is just a movie where the dialogue turns cursive sometimes the dialogue turns cursive

2201
02:40:23,840 --> 02:40:26,480
Okay, I have seen descendants. I won't lie. I have watched

2202
02:40:27,840 --> 02:40:29,840
I think two of the descendants movies

2203
02:40:30,560 --> 02:40:36,080
I know that a christian chenna with is in one and she's got a bomb musical number that I really like

2204
02:40:37,040 --> 02:40:39,040
I think there's a third one

2205
02:40:39,360 --> 02:40:43,200
I know that they're coming out with an alice in wonderland one, but I've never seen them

2206
02:40:44,320 --> 02:40:45,680
interesting

2207
02:40:45,680 --> 02:40:50,960
Mm-hmm. I've also never actually watched high school musical because it was so advertised so heavily

2208
02:40:51,040 --> 02:40:55,520
I was just like I ain't watching this. I liked high school musical. Okay. Maybe I did like musicals

2209
02:40:57,120 --> 02:41:01,840
I was like, uh, and I said I didn't watch a lot of musicals. Oh, yeah. I know I liked high school musical

2210
02:41:02,560 --> 02:41:04,480
I pretended to hate it

2211
02:41:04,480 --> 02:41:06,480
But I secretly liked it

2212
02:41:06,560 --> 02:41:08,560
I really like get your head in the game

2213
02:41:09,760 --> 02:41:13,280
I remember trying to do the and that and we're all in this together the choreography. Oh

2214
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:15,200
I hate myself for that

2215
02:41:15,200 --> 02:41:19,840
My only my only regret is I got on the glee train too late

2216
02:41:20,560 --> 02:41:24,480
I don't like glee though. I tried watching glee my parents liked glee a lot

2217
02:41:25,200 --> 02:41:28,480
I don't blame you for not liking glee though because it's like digrassy

2218
02:41:29,440 --> 02:41:31,440
Yeah

2219
02:41:32,400 --> 02:41:34,960
That's a good grassy hilarious

2220
02:41:36,240 --> 02:41:38,560
I don't I haven't watched a grassy in the longest time

2221
02:41:39,200 --> 02:41:41,200
I I'm wondering how it aged

2222
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:48,080
You should do you should do a watch along the watch along the grassy watch and this drake in a wheelchair just hanging out

2223
02:41:48,880 --> 02:41:51,200
um, I mean, I'd rather watch misfits

2224
02:41:52,320 --> 02:41:54,320
or freaks and geeks

2225
02:41:54,560 --> 02:41:56,160
um

2226
02:41:56,160 --> 02:41:57,360
I don't

2227
02:41:57,360 --> 02:41:59,280
Have you ever seen freaks and geeks freaks and geeks?

2228
02:41:59,920 --> 02:42:01,920
No, I don't think I've ever seen freaks

2229
02:42:03,520 --> 02:42:09,920
You would love freaks and geeks son. Oh my god. I think probably with seth rogan and

2230
02:42:10,800 --> 02:42:12,800
His friend that always does james franco

2231
02:42:15,520 --> 02:42:16,800
I think

2232
02:42:16,800 --> 02:42:20,960
Maybe I might like it because I did like uh, the whitest kids, you know

2233
02:42:22,800 --> 02:42:27,280
You would okay. You definitely like it. You definitely will either it's like it's so goofy

2234
02:42:28,080 --> 02:42:32,000
We love goofy and then you also have um, oh, what's her name?

2235
02:42:34,160 --> 02:42:36,000
I always forget her name

2236
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:43,040
Her funny name goofy is canonically the only disney character that has had sex. I yeah, he

2237
02:42:43,600 --> 02:42:45,200
Goofy gets it

2238
02:42:45,200 --> 02:42:47,680
Yeah, he can he can get it. Yes

2239
02:42:48,640 --> 02:42:50,880
I forget like he's got a son. Yeah

2240
02:42:51,840 --> 02:42:57,200
Oh, wait, I'm sorry. I misspoke pete also has had relations more than relations

2241
02:42:58,640 --> 02:43:01,360
Well, yeah, he has a smoking hot wife named peg

2242
02:43:02,160 --> 02:43:03,040
True

2243
02:43:03,040 --> 02:43:09,760
That's right. Actually a beautiful daughter. He has two children. All right, so I guess only the dogs can reproduce in this

2244
02:43:10,800 --> 02:43:12,800
Well pizza cat

2245
02:43:12,800 --> 02:43:14,320
Pizza cat

2246
02:43:14,320 --> 02:43:15,840
Yeah pizza cat

2247
02:43:15,840 --> 02:43:17,360
What?

2248
02:43:17,360 --> 02:43:20,720
Yep, he has pistol. He has peg. He has pj

2249
02:43:23,840 --> 02:43:28,880
Egg like pete it's a cat. That's why he hates mickey mouse so much, but he's super chill with goofy

2250
02:43:33,360 --> 02:43:35,360
My life is a lie

2251
02:43:35,680 --> 02:43:38,560
I had no idea. I thought he was just a short-eared dog

2252
02:43:39,280 --> 02:43:41,280
Not either cat

2253
02:43:41,760 --> 02:43:45,600
Pistol pete is the youngest daughter of pete and peg that appeared in goof troop

2254
02:43:46,480 --> 02:43:48,480
Mm-hmm

2255
02:43:48,800 --> 02:43:50,800
It's funny because

2256
02:43:50,800 --> 02:43:54,880
In the series max is 11 and a half years old moves his father and their cat waffles

2257
02:43:54,960 --> 02:43:57,520
So it's like they own a cat and there's cat people

2258
02:43:58,640 --> 02:44:03,440
Well, to be fair pete had a dog and it was like a real bougie dog

2259
02:44:04,480 --> 02:44:06,480
Oh, I remember this from goof troop. Yeah

2260
02:44:07,440 --> 02:44:11,040
His voice by Nancy Cartwright. Oh, yeah, who boys Bart Simpson

2261
02:44:11,840 --> 02:44:14,720
Yep, she's been in the industry a lot. Yeah

2262
02:44:15,760 --> 02:44:20,480
I've been watching um game grumps play like the putt putt and she voiced in some of the

2263
02:44:21,200 --> 02:44:22,080
the

2264
02:44:22,080 --> 02:44:24,080
Super ever going it's called

2265
02:44:24,720 --> 02:44:26,800
Whatever company that made those games

2266
02:44:27,600 --> 02:44:29,600
Super humongous. Yeah

2267
02:44:30,240 --> 02:44:33,600
Yeah, I'm just like man. I never played any of these games. I kind of wish I did

2268
02:44:34,320 --> 02:44:39,040
My favorite putt putt is putt putt saves the zoo. Putt putt saves the zoo. I remember watching them play that

2269
02:44:39,680 --> 02:44:41,680
It's pretty goofy. Um

2270
02:44:42,240 --> 02:44:44,240
Yeah, I think I think it was before my time

2271
02:44:44,560 --> 02:44:46,560
the putt putt games

2272
02:44:47,600 --> 02:44:50,720
I think they're on sale on the steam sale now. That'll be funny to play

2273
02:44:52,640 --> 02:44:55,360
I I kind of want to play pajama sam though

2274
02:44:56,080 --> 02:44:58,880
Pajama sam. Oh, yeah, I watched game of play pajama sam

2275
02:44:59,760 --> 02:45:01,760
Or that was that was good too

2276
02:45:01,760 --> 02:45:04,400
there's like really cute point and click adventures and

2277
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:09,760
I think actually maybe I'll recommend mercy to play one of those because mercy has gets motion sick

2278
02:45:09,760 --> 02:45:13,200
And so I think she would probably appreciate kind of a cutesy goofy

2279
02:45:14,240 --> 02:45:15,360
point click

2280
02:45:15,360 --> 02:45:17,360
Maybe she's already played one

2281
02:45:18,400 --> 02:45:20,720
Maybe or she might like monkey island

2282
02:45:21,360 --> 02:45:23,200
What's monkey island?

2283
02:45:23,200 --> 02:45:25,760
Monkey island is like a pirate

2284
02:45:26,320 --> 02:45:29,280
adventure sort of like point and click adventure

2285
02:45:29,600 --> 02:45:31,600
But I don't know too much about it

2286
02:45:32,080 --> 02:45:35,120
But I but people are always recommending to play it

2287
02:45:35,520 --> 02:45:41,200
Maybe if she played that because then she would can wear her little eye patch and then she can cosplay as a little pirate

2288
02:45:41,840 --> 02:45:42,400
Yeah, yeah

2289
02:45:42,400 --> 02:45:48,080
She usually cosplays as the characters in the games that she plays like she was mario the other day and now we call her mercy

2290
02:45:48,240 --> 02:45:50,240
Oh, it was very funny

2291
02:45:50,880 --> 02:45:56,480
By madame you're 56. That's true. So it was it was after my time actually

2292
02:45:57,200 --> 02:45:59,200
This the super humongous games

2293
02:46:00,720 --> 02:46:01,840
Oh

2294
02:46:01,920 --> 02:46:05,200
All right, P. But now you can play them with your computer. Yeah

2295
02:46:06,960 --> 02:46:09,600
I was too poor as a child to afford them before

2296
02:46:10,720 --> 02:46:12,560
back when I was

2297
02:46:12,560 --> 02:46:14,800
Born in 19 fort. That's not

2298
02:46:15,920 --> 02:46:18,960
I don't know. I can't I can't really math. So like can I

2299
02:46:20,560 --> 02:46:24,720
I like how misdreavus is just in between us this entire time during this conversation

2300
02:46:25,600 --> 02:46:31,440
I know just like minding her own business. She's in her own lane. Yeah. She's hanging out

2301
02:46:32,800 --> 02:46:34,800
Oh

2302
02:46:34,800 --> 02:46:36,800
All right

2303
02:46:36,800 --> 02:46:38,800
That was a good tangent for 40 minutes

2304
02:46:40,080 --> 02:46:42,080
My dad

2305
02:46:42,240 --> 02:46:48,000
No, please don't ever don't ever apologize. Literally. I I told you I was streaming till like 4 a.m. Yes

2306
02:46:48,880 --> 02:46:50,480
today technically

2307
02:46:50,480 --> 02:46:53,600
Because I was just going on tangents just talking about absolutely nothing

2308
02:46:55,200 --> 02:46:59,600
Oh my god, this is great. I also just like getting lore like

2309
02:47:00,560 --> 02:47:03,360
TV lore from you and cartoon lore

2310
02:47:04,160 --> 02:47:09,200
Man, I I can go off on like any sort of cartoon without trying

2311
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:12,880
My favorite though has been like pebble and the penguin

2312
02:47:13,040 --> 02:47:17,440
But I won't get you started because we'll be here for two hours. Did she just start watching that?

2313
02:47:18,240 --> 02:47:20,240
I I watch it every week

2314
02:47:25,760 --> 02:47:28,880
Sorry, I like it's funny watching my muppet bounce

2315
02:47:30,080 --> 02:47:34,320
Also, my favorite thing to say right now is rest in peace martin short

2316
02:47:35,200 --> 02:47:37,680
Is he dead? Yeah, I'm like, no, he's dead

2317
02:47:38,400 --> 02:47:41,920
No, he's not dead, but it's past his bedtime and I'm hope he's sleeping. Well

2318
02:47:44,880 --> 02:47:46,880
I hope if you're sleeping well

2319
02:47:47,680 --> 02:47:50,320
I hope you're sleeping. Well, mr. Martin short. I love you

2320
02:47:54,640 --> 02:47:58,720
Uh great comedian him and uh, I love him and

2321
02:47:59,600 --> 02:48:01,600
What's his face?

2322
02:48:02,320 --> 02:48:04,320
They're always it together in something

2323
02:48:05,120 --> 02:48:10,240
Oh my god, I'm gonna they're literally in no murder no murders in the building together

2324
02:48:11,200 --> 02:48:13,200
Uh

2325
02:48:13,520 --> 02:48:16,400
It can't be Andy dick everybody. No, it's not any dick

2326
02:48:18,240 --> 02:48:22,160
Everybody hates Andy dick. Oh my god. I'm gonna I'm just gonna look up

2327
02:48:22,800 --> 02:48:28,240
Because I I like martin short, I even liked him in that

2328
02:48:29,200 --> 02:48:31,200
Steve martin. Thank you

2329
02:48:31,360 --> 02:48:33,360
Steve martin so funny

2330
02:48:33,600 --> 02:48:39,840
Yes, I liked I liked martin short in that terrible dorthy returns movie. That was like basically

2331
02:48:40,800 --> 02:48:43,280
The producer's live action in real life

2332
02:48:45,360 --> 02:48:47,360
If you don't know what the producers is about

2333
02:48:47,680 --> 02:48:52,560
Which is a musical by the way, but it was like a movie that is called a musical before it was a musical

2334
02:48:53,040 --> 02:48:55,040
it's basically about like

2335
02:48:55,040 --> 02:49:03,280
Uh an accountant and a producer getting together and the accountant's like hey your books are wrong and the producer's like look man

2336
02:49:03,600 --> 02:49:09,440
I'm on hard times. Can't you just move a few decimals and then the accountant's like, you know,

2337
02:49:10,080 --> 02:49:13,680
You know, you could make more money with a flop than with a hit

2338
02:49:14,400 --> 02:49:19,840
Because if you make a flop, you don't have to pay back what you spent on the flop

2339
02:49:19,920 --> 02:49:24,480
Which is like what a lot of a lot of uh hollywood companies do

2340
02:49:25,200 --> 02:49:31,760
Right now where if they considered like a form of media a flop, they'll write it off for taxes and they can't like

2341
02:49:32,480 --> 02:49:34,480
Make that's so stupid

2342
02:49:34,720 --> 02:49:37,920
It is it's how we get a lot of lost media and I hate it. Damn

2343
02:49:39,280 --> 02:49:41,280
Damn them

2344
02:49:41,520 --> 02:49:43,520
Someone's asking where your clothes are at

2345
02:49:44,400 --> 02:49:45,920
I'm a dog

2346
02:49:45,920 --> 02:49:48,320
I'm wearing a collar. That's my clothes. Yeah

2347
02:49:49,280 --> 02:49:51,280
She's clothes. She's wearing her collar

2348
02:49:51,600 --> 02:49:53,600
Let's think about me where your clothes at

2349
02:49:55,440 --> 02:49:57,680
I'm like the dog like walks into a room

2350
02:49:58,720 --> 02:50:00,560
Oh

2351
02:50:00,560 --> 02:50:06,880
Like you don't go around looking at like family guy wondering like man. Why isn't brian wearing a shirt? That's a good point

2352
02:50:07,360 --> 02:50:11,200
I'm only wearing clothes because my bunny boobies are very large

2353
02:50:12,320 --> 02:50:14,720
And that's I just don't think it's the proper thing to do

2354
02:50:15,600 --> 02:50:21,680
Obviously, you're very talented. That's why you have clothes. Yeah, although I wonder if I took my bra off

2355
02:50:22,960 --> 02:50:24,960
Would I just have velvet?

2356
02:50:25,280 --> 02:50:26,320
Hmm

2357
02:50:26,320 --> 02:50:32,640
You know, I imagine maybe I had considered giving you a muppet nipples, but we didn't do it

2358
02:50:33,040 --> 02:50:35,280
Yeah, the other art you gave me muppet nipples

2359
02:50:36,240 --> 02:50:38,880
Well, yeah, but that was for a comedy. Yeah

2360
02:50:40,800 --> 02:50:41,920
So, I mean I'm

2361
02:50:41,920 --> 02:50:45,680
Because you don't have any nipples. That means I don't have any nipples. We're just nipple monopolist

2362
02:50:46,800 --> 02:50:52,160
Like if I had like legs like if you sewed me up and you like made me like a full body muppet

2363
02:50:52,560 --> 02:50:54,720
I probably have I probably have mupples

2364
02:50:55,760 --> 02:50:57,920
Yeah, I kind of lower down on your belly. Yeah

2365
02:50:59,040 --> 02:51:03,280
Yeah, like especially in this form, but who knows who knows if it's between like two

2366
02:51:04,080 --> 02:51:06,880
Four and six who knows we'll roll a dice when we get there

2367
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:10,000
roll for mupples

2368
02:51:10,160 --> 02:51:12,160
Roll for mupples one d6

2369
02:51:12,720 --> 02:51:15,600
No muppet milk. Uh, sorry. No, I don't think

2370
02:51:17,600 --> 02:51:19,600
I don't have organs

2371
02:51:19,760 --> 02:51:23,520
We yeah, we don't have well you could pour milk on us and suck it out like

2372
02:51:24,880 --> 02:51:27,200
Like a security blanket sort of thing. Yeah

2373
02:51:28,480 --> 02:51:30,480
Like use my little muppet

2374
02:51:31,200 --> 02:51:33,200
Booby is a security blanket

2375
02:51:33,440 --> 02:51:35,440
Yeah, I was a little passy

2376
02:51:35,680 --> 02:51:39,760
Yeah, just pour a little milk on her and then just suck it out. Yeah, see that works

2377
02:51:40,400 --> 02:51:43,840
Yeah, it's kind of like what people do with their hoodie strings like delicious

2378
02:51:46,960 --> 02:51:51,360
Honestly hoodie strings are quite delicious. I will honey, especially when their agla is just like just right

2379
02:51:52,160 --> 02:51:56,720
Oh, I know what you're talking about and I 100% agree and like chewing on that

2380
02:51:57,680 --> 02:52:01,840
And and like getting the knot undone and then redoing it later. Hmm

2381
02:52:05,280 --> 02:52:11,200
They don't get it. This is why we're on the short bus and uh, the magic school bus

2382
02:52:13,280 --> 02:52:16,800
We don't understand the science and miss frizzle just keeps us there. Yeah

2383
02:52:20,480 --> 02:52:25,920
Okay, they don't have organs we can go as deep as we want without worry of wrecking you can still rip us

2384
02:52:27,280 --> 02:52:30,480
Well, yeah, but we could be sewn back up. Yeah, we could be sewn back up

2385
02:52:31,680 --> 02:52:35,840
So I guess like as long as we're forever it immortal in the muppet form

2386
02:52:36,160 --> 02:52:41,360
It it could get as violent as possible. But like cleaning ourselves would be kind of frustrating

2387
02:52:42,160 --> 02:52:44,240
Do you think they would just throw us in the washing machine?

2388
02:52:45,200 --> 02:52:47,280
No, we don't need to breathe. So I think that would work out

2389
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:51,120
Yeah, but I'm gonna request goggles and

2390
02:52:51,760 --> 02:52:56,640
Because I can't see underwater neither can I I didn't know that people can normally see underwater

2391
02:52:57,280 --> 02:53:03,760
I didn't know that either. It's it makes my eyes all stingy. I know it hurts my eyes real bad even if it's in like a normal clear

2392
02:53:04,800 --> 02:53:07,760
Water thing. I thought nobody could see underwater

2393
02:53:08,560 --> 02:53:09,760
Same

2394
02:53:09,760 --> 02:53:11,760
Apparently, it just means I'm blind

2395
02:53:12,080 --> 02:53:17,440
Do you also hate getting water up your nose? Yes, it burns. I I hate water on my nose

2396
02:53:18,400 --> 02:53:19,680
So bad

2397
02:53:19,680 --> 02:53:23,360
Like you take a washcloth and you dip it in like the shower water and then you wipe your face

2398
02:53:23,360 --> 02:53:26,720
You don't go like full face into the water. No, exactly

2399
02:53:27,680 --> 02:53:29,680
I get you. I'm good on that

2400
02:53:31,360 --> 02:53:33,360
Or like I like plug my nose

2401
02:53:35,760 --> 02:53:38,000
Plug your nose close your eyes and just a quick

2402
02:53:39,200 --> 02:53:42,720
And then that you're out. Yeah, just like what's that? I saw that animation

2403
02:53:44,720 --> 02:53:48,160
Oh, wait, it's yeah, what's when the dwarves from snow white are washing their face

2404
02:53:49,120 --> 02:53:50,880
God that meant that that scene makes me

2405
02:53:51,280 --> 02:53:53,280
Irrationally angry. Why?

2406
02:53:54,080 --> 02:53:57,760
Because I would try to do it and that's how I learned that I hate what getting water up my nose

2407
02:53:59,040 --> 02:54:01,040
You do grab a dub is up and

2408
02:54:03,280 --> 02:54:10,320
And and then the fact that oh man, I'm going to go off on another tangent grumpy was absolutely right the clocks

2409
02:54:10,400 --> 02:54:12,400
Though white as a fucking trifle

2410
02:54:13,120 --> 02:54:15,120
Because

2411
02:54:15,440 --> 02:54:16,640
Because

2412
02:54:16,640 --> 02:54:21,440
Like I don't blame grumpy for being a woman hater. She brought a lot of trouble. Yeah

2413
02:54:21,680 --> 02:54:26,160
They were just chilling and she did just like barge on right in do everything

2414
02:54:27,040 --> 02:54:29,040
And she brought a witch

2415
02:54:29,040 --> 02:54:34,640
Like if somebody came into my personal space and cleaned up everything my organized chaos

2416
02:54:34,720 --> 02:54:36,320
I'd be so upset

2417
02:54:36,320 --> 02:54:38,640
And then like you hear the distress. It's like

2418
02:54:39,360 --> 02:54:44,400
Somebody washed my cup sugar is gone. It takes time to develop a sugar crust

2419
02:54:46,080 --> 02:54:48,560
It takes time that bitch cleaned his cup

2420
02:54:49,120 --> 02:54:53,840
And you know, she probably didn't clean it properly. She had the animals do it and they probably licked that

2421
02:54:54,000 --> 02:55:00,880
Oh, yeah, it's all it's not even properly cleaned. It's it's even technically dirtier than when she they how they left it

2422
02:55:02,080 --> 02:55:03,760
Oh

2423
02:55:03,760 --> 02:55:05,760
gross

2424
02:55:06,240 --> 02:55:10,720
And then she had the nerve to shame them. It's like did you wash your hands before supper?

2425
02:55:11,200 --> 02:55:16,400
Bitch, you're in their house. How are you gonna make the man? I know she just comes in all high and mighty

2426
02:55:17,360 --> 02:55:20,160
Like princesses, man. She wasn't I am I am

2427
02:55:21,200 --> 02:55:27,760
I have come up with the opinion that snow white is not just a movie about a princess who's evil stepmother

2428
02:55:28,240 --> 02:55:34,020
Like once her dead it is about two doms in a kingdom fighting for supremacy

2429
02:55:36,000 --> 02:55:38,800
Because so light is a developing dom

2430
02:55:39,280 --> 02:55:41,280
And she's those little men

2431
02:55:41,600 --> 02:55:48,400
Yes, the queen is a developed dom and she doms the kingdom. Yeah, she does this for beauty and her power

2432
02:55:48,720 --> 02:55:56,720
But like at the same time she's like, oh no an up-and-coming bitch and that up-and-coming bitch is using her powers

2433
02:55:56,880 --> 02:55:58,080
Yeah

2434
02:55:58,080 --> 02:56:03,680
Unbeknownst to anybody to get things done the way she wants. She domps the forest. Oh my god

2435
02:56:04,480 --> 02:56:06,480
She doms the little men

2436
02:56:06,640 --> 02:56:12,240
And she basically doms the heart of the prince who's just kind of waltzes into her. I know he just like shows up

2437
02:56:12,320 --> 02:56:13,760
That's kind of weird

2438
02:56:13,760 --> 02:56:15,840
When she's singing and he just shows up. They're all weird

2439
02:56:16,560 --> 02:56:19,760
I think the queen is the only in the dwarf is the only rational ones here

2440
02:56:20,480 --> 02:56:21,840
right

2441
02:56:21,840 --> 02:56:23,680
damn

2442
02:56:23,680 --> 02:56:25,680
But yeah, that's how I fell about snow white

2443
02:56:25,680 --> 02:56:27,680
Hahaha

2444
02:56:29,520 --> 02:56:36,160
Snow white being a soft dom actually makes sense and she's around 14. Oh, I forgot how young she was

2445
02:56:36,960 --> 02:56:40,480
It's just she be no. No. No. I'm not snow white

2446
02:56:41,600 --> 02:56:43,440
I'm not snow white either

2447
02:56:43,440 --> 02:56:46,000
I was about to start singing wishing well

2448
02:56:47,920 --> 02:56:49,920
I'm wishing

2449
02:56:50,640 --> 02:56:52,640
I'm wishing

2450
02:56:53,600 --> 02:56:55,600
For the one I love

2451
02:56:57,200 --> 02:57:02,480
I thought we're gonna do it for a moment. Oh, yeah, but it's always to find me

2452
02:57:03,520 --> 02:57:05,520
to find

2453
02:57:06,400 --> 02:57:08,400
Today

2454
02:57:10,640 --> 02:57:17,440
Now that I found you here's what I have to say

2455
02:57:17,520 --> 02:57:19,520
Hey

2456
02:57:19,840 --> 02:57:25,680
And then he just goes in for it and she's like, oh my god, damn just like that

2457
02:57:28,160 --> 02:57:33,200
Jesus oh my god, I think I got the vapors the vapors

2458
02:57:37,200 --> 02:57:39,200
Oh

2459
02:57:39,520 --> 02:57:43,760
No, she'd be just Jessica Ravis says has to help her out the laundry she

2460
02:57:44,720 --> 02:57:52,240
Uh goes from soft on snow white and everything to mean like yeah, so I think about snow white so casually

2461
02:57:52,800 --> 02:57:54,800
okay, yes, but um

2462
02:57:54,880 --> 02:57:56,240
in short

2463
02:57:56,240 --> 02:57:59,680
If you do use our Muppet bodies for your gooning purposes

2464
02:58:00,800 --> 02:58:03,920
You have to make sure that you either align us with something

2465
02:58:04,560 --> 02:58:07,840
Or clean us properly because that just isn't fair to us, you know

2466
02:58:08,640 --> 02:58:11,760
Right, don't just throw a rag at us and call it a day

2467
02:58:12,160 --> 02:58:17,440
You know, we're not proper aftercare. Yeah, don't use us as a rag

2468
02:58:20,000 --> 02:58:23,680
Oh, no, I just realized I never told you my ratatouille theories

2469
02:58:26,720 --> 02:58:29,200
And we'll save that for the next episode

2470
02:58:31,840 --> 02:58:34,320
Next time on tracking balls

2471
02:58:38,800 --> 02:58:40,800
All right, I'm gonna go to bed

2472
02:58:42,720 --> 02:58:46,000
You'll have to you guys will have to find out in the next episode of smash your pass

2473
02:58:46,400 --> 02:58:51,200
We'll figure out a time. Let's slap it on my schedule next week. Um, but good night

2474
02:58:54,240 --> 02:58:56,240

2480
02:59:19,120 --> 02:59:22,000
