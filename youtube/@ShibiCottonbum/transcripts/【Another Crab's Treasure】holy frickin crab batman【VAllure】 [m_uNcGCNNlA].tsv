30000	60000	I'm going to do a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little
60000	90000	bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit
90000	120000	of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of
120000	150000	a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a
150000	180000	little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little
180000	204920	Look who it is. If it isn't a couple of losers. Do you like my cover up? I think it's effective.
204920	213960	harlots today. It's my little sensor bar and also if you don't know my name I
213960	219840	think it's effective. Hello hello how's it going? It's going good! Having a good
219840	228080	day today. Lounge in Maxon and Relaxon. We'll listen to a little bit of Kylie
228080	237040	Minogue of some pre-stream prep. I would really like to dance a bunch and just
237040	242160	get real hype before stream. Don't forget to tweet. You're correct. You're
242160	250480	correct. Can't forget. I smell absolutely delicious because I just came out of the
250480	256600	shower and I forgot, boomie with the home, and I forgot I had some of my
256600	267160	favorite lotion left. I really like the smell of pansy from Lush. It's funny
267160	274080	because on my friend it smelled like old lady flowers but on me I
274080	281840	don't know. Maybe it's my pheromones. It just smells absolutely delicious. Oh we
281840	290640	getting raided! Raflin ride! Holy crap! It's Momay! Have fun beating the crabs!
290640	298560	Forever beating back the crabs. How was the monetization stream? Oh did you guys
298560	307640	have a nice dose of Momay feet? Can I get a sniffer? This is me smelling
307640	316120	Strony's feet. Oh god. Smells smells like salty sea brine. Fucking love it!
316840	324960	Momay's monkey feet! I honestly I'm very impressed with her dexterity with her
324960	331080	feet. Like I definitely I don't I could probably hold something but she was
331080	336880	like doing the whole thing where she's like sticking like ASMR tools in your
336880	345840	ear and I was just I was impressed. I just lurked because I was beating my
345840	357480	I mean I mean I was trying to practice my own foot dexterity. So now do your
357480	361920	foot ASMR stream. Yeah I'm waiting for my red high heels to come in. I need to get
361920	368400	my so like I said that was like that picture I took was from like a month
368400	379520	ago. So I need to get my toes done again. Great carpet clenches. Carpet clenches.
379520	388040	Now that that's one. Carpet grippers. Yeah I got I got the watch of my
388040	395240	collards. I got my tights. Now I just need the heels. I still haven't tried on the
395280	400880	cosplay. I need to do that. And if it doesn't fit I might just wear the shirt
400880	404600	unbuttoned and then this this just like I'll just find it try to find it with
404600	411320	mini skirt. Heel dangle. Oh yeah. Love my giant name tag. Thank you. It's my my
411320	416160	cover-up. I think it's doing a pretty good job. It's not transparent or
416160	426160	anything. Carp. I don't know if I would call it like a carpet clencher. Like use
426160	432480	feet for that on a the other type of carpet. That just sounds painful. Like
432480	438800	did you ever like have that one person or friend that could like use their feet
438800	443680	and like pinch you with them? One of my childhood friends would freak me out by
443680	447080	doing that. Maybe that's not what that's why I'm not into feet is because I was
447080	452720	traumatized by my friend pinching you with her monkey feet. So like imagine
452720	458080	like oh my god ASMR roleplay where Shawnee pinches you with her feet as
458080	466800	punishment. Yep yep. Brother can snap with his toes. What the hell? That's just
467120	474480	Is he a mutant? Or is she a Scott? No. She was just blonde white girl.
479040	480880	And she had the she had a valley girl accent.
483520	491520	Very funny. Where is she pinching? Well in terms of Shawnee, I don't know that's up to her.
491920	498240	Sorry. I'm adjusting myself a little bit here. I can use my feet to pick up the small objects
498240	502400	on the other side of my desk. What the fuck? Thank you. Thank you. I have a great sensor.
503600	511040	Ebony Darkness. Ebony. She she uh Shibbony. Shibbony Darkness took over my channel for a
511040	515280	couple of streams yesterday. My cats have the zoomies right now. What are you doing?
515920	520560	Can you chill out and stop chasing her? Oomie's like harassing a sister.
522080	527280	I hope you guys enjoyed her. She was she was pretty cool. She's a little bit too edgy for my
527280	537200	taste. But uh yeah she's nice. Just like um the other other lady that uh was running that one bar.
537200	540960	She can also disconnect her head from her body. It's really impressive. I wish I had that skill
540960	545120	you know. 10 hour stream today. I I think not.
547920	555920	I think not. I think uh just because I don't think I have I'll probably end up rage quitting
555920	561760	especially with the level the portion of the part that we're on for um uh another crabs
561760	569440	event uh adventure. Another crabs treasure. Nine hour stream then. And a lot of fanfic reading
569440	576080	happened. I went done no I went uphill. We were on a straight incline. We talked about you know how
578560	584720	Hogwarts and a squid made beautiful consensual love. Um
588800	594640	can you hear my cats zooming around my house right now? I turn off the filter so you can.
594640	598240	You hear there's a little just like galloping and then they're they're tokyo drifting around
598240	605040	the corners in my apartment. Just don't be bad at video game. Uh that's impossible for me.
606880	615200	Don't run with your wands out. Yeah there was just like scrawny um squid inked everywhere in Hogwarts.
618720	621680	I have some delicious tea. Heard it a little. No.
621680	629040	It's because Fia likes to take refuge by my feet under my desk. I'm like I'm like you know how
629040	636240	when you play tag as a kid or like just some sort of tag related game um you would have like a
636240	642240	home base where you were safe especially if it was like freeze tag or something. That's what they
642240	645920	use me as. I'm not even joking. If I'm in any part of the house and they're running around
646480	651760	Boomi and Fia will use me as like a home base. Hello welcome in.
654560	662480	What literary masterpiece did you miss yesterday? You missed uh 15 chapters of My Immortal and um
663680	670880	the actual castle Hogwarts being uh tentacle banged by a giant squid. So if you ever check
670880	679840	those out go check them out. You know I'm also working on um I'm gonna re uh public I don't
679840	685120	know what the fuck I'm saying. I'm gonna make public that class of 09 VOD that everybody loved.
685120	691200	I'm just waiting to get monetization before I do because I feel like they would go on that and
691200	695200	they'd be like wow this is bad. We thought the other video was bad of class of what this is worse.
695200	700720	That was my cat.
703920	710960	They're zooming. Yeah yeah I gotta gotta sneak it one in. Yeah I don't they they were pretty like
710960	716720	Boomi was chilling next to me and then they just started zooming. Happy Tuesday. It's Tuesday unit!
717680	722880	Rob, Rob is fucking Tuesday. I can fucking say it. It's Tuesday.
724800	732160	First get monetized then get canceled. Um you know my attempt at speedrunning getting canceled has
732960	742480	not worked. I'm very surprised by that. It's Chokshik Tuesday. She'd be Tuesday. I'm really
742480	746800	excited to hopefully be um do the monetization stream and do like member streams because I'm
746800	751840	telling you I want to do that self-tying shabar stream. You can't see what I'm pointing at you
751840	756400	and waggling my finger like a teacher who knows you're up to no good because you copied off of
756400	764240	someone's homework. I'm very very excited for the power wash collab this week. That is going to be
764240	772800	funny as hell. I'm debating whether or not to stream my viewpoint. What do you guys think?
772800	776320	Like what do you want? Because it's going to be all of us streaming at the same time and I'm like
778160	782560	what's the point? I'm like I don't know. If you want me to see do you want to see my viewpoint?
783920	789760	I'm sorry I can't draw Rob Shibi. It's okay. A lot of the artists that will make commission for me
789760	798720	they always drew my ropes as straps. Like even my header art and my twitter and my wallpaper
798720	803760	that I also use it. It's just straps. It's just leather straps. It's not even rope or it looks
803760	813920	like ribbon. Give the clippers work. Hey Shibi I bought all 50 parts of the paper. Thanks for the
814080	822720	recommendation. Oh my god. That is such a just read like an excerpt from that book and you can
822720	834560	thank me later. I managed to shake down Emmy for the book title of the interesting book she wants
834560	840080	to read. I read the synopsis and I was like okay this is right up my alley all right. She's like
840080	846640	what? And I'm like yeah I'm on that shit and she's like oh okay and then I sent another
847840	857280	terrible fucked up smut book her way. I sent her den of vipers. I couldn't even get through that book
857280	864400	it was so bad. But I'm like I'm trying to try to convince management to give me a podcast with
864800	875680	um uh my IRL friend Salem because she also reads a lot of smutty books and and maybe Emmy and we
875680	880720	can have a little book club together and the other girls because I you know you know mercy reads that
880720	888880	shit you know she reads that shit you know and you would like you would like Salem she's cute and
888880	903520	funny maybe I'll drop a PNG for her. Mercy is say so she be. She's she's she's got you guys good huh
904240	911920	her sweet little yandere facade yeah yeah just wait just wait till she shows her true power
912880	919920	none of you will be safe. My GF right smut ironically I used to write so much
920640	929680	smut when I was younger. So Salem is what I call one of my um uh one of my best friends IRL. She is
930640	939200	uh very cute and funny she is adorable um she is way more base than I am.
943040	946960	You guys would like her a lot I might just I would probably be it wouldn't be like a live podcast
946960	953040	which definitely is like a pre-recorded thing um she heavily supports me v-tubing and she was so proud
953040	959360	of me um when I got accepted into VLR her and Olive which is one of my other IRL friends and Olive
959360	964400	is an actress so she was just like yeah entertainment industry so we're all creative types out here
966240	969920	uh bro mercy says she showers once a week and nothing sweet on that girl what do you mean
969920	975280	you know it's like when something smells so so bad that it almost smells like sourly sickly sweet
977120	983120	that's that's mercy there I say Salem for gen two no she got she got she does not have enough time
983120	989120	to be a vtuber she does not have time to be a vtuber she got she got a big girl job
990560	996720	envisioned the aroma I yeah I used to I used to write so much fucking smut when I was younger
996720	1003920	I was no like me and my other my uh one of my childhood best friends um like I mentioned before
1003920	1010880	like we would do post by post role play a lot and then we realized oh my god we're we're good at writing
1010880	1017040	what if we wrote bad stuff and so we would get requests from other students on our our grade
1017760	1026400	mind you this was like fifth grade and we were known as like uh the the lemon girls
1027360	1028400	if you know what a lemon is
1030960	1035840	and some people would get us requests from their favorite characters and we would write like
1036640	1044720	we take like commissions and we'd be like all right and I'd be like uh insert this classmate's
1044720	1057520	name here with this character from this uh anime it was bad I remember one of the teachers um
1058080	1064720	um found one of the stuff because like we had a we had a notebook dedicated for that shit
1065920	1071360	I I think I threw it away when I was moving and I'm pissed at myself and my old sketchbook
1071360	1075440	because I would have led to show you guys my old sketchbook with all my OCs that I had
1075440	1080800	when I was like the ages of 12 to 18
1081520	1086080	dude write me in a jar jar banks do

1095040	1102080	literature classes and um and creative writing I remember in my creative writing class I wrote
1102160	1112160	I wrote so I had written this like really nicely done like introductory story almost
1112160	1118160	like an isekai but it was like to a different planet like again I would I really liked the
1118160	1124880	princess of mars like the john carter series so I was very heavily inspired by that and like the
1124880	1131600	main character was this dude they got abducted it was made into a slave for the queen of the
1131600	1138320	world and I like submitted that for the creative writing class and everybody was like wow this is
1138320	1142080	great and I'm like do you guys want to see the second chapter it's where they bang and my teacher's
1142080	1153840	like no no no no no no no no hold hold your horses hold your horses I fucking love my English teacher

1221600	1226080	from I think I was like a junior or sophomore in high school
1228080	1232080	ironically a member's book book club would be probably I want to do that so bad it would be
1232080	1236160	so fucking we just read like smutty books though like really bad ones like maybe the first book
1236160	1247760	will be ice planet barbarians no eat my wet heart always take a sip of my tea
1252000	1257280	my high school English teacher loved listening to drama facts it was funny because like my
1257280	1263520	my biology teacher she was a fucking wackadoodle and she was awesome like we remember it for class
1263520	1274080	we watched like 28 days later and um was it not oh it started with a sea caught oh my god what the
1274080	1279200	fuck is that movie it's literally where everybody's sick and infection spreads throughout the entire
1279200	1286080	world it was literally like pre covid before covid um but and then she would just be like hey guys
1286080	1291600	let's go and put locker she just she just queue up the fucking movies we do that for class contagion
1291600	1298560	yes contagion contagion's a great fucking movie I love contagion really really bad wattpad stories
1298560	1305520	yes yes I let you know one of my guilty pleasures it was the um it used to be a wattpad series and
1305520	1310000	it blew up and they actually published it into books it's the after series now those are toxic
1310000	1315440	and terrible and then I watched the movies I still have to watch the last one me and me and
1315440	1320640	Salem and Olive uh would just go over Salem's house and we just laugh you know like uh what is
1320640	1333200	his name wanna I know like Chad Chad did a review of the after movies and so did um Connor was it
1333200	1340480	what's his name I don't know but um I don't I don't remember names okay I only remember faces um
1340480	1345360	that they just like did like making fun of it you know a movie is good when it's such a good
1345360	1352960	a pal for dying she's like my goop and then she just fucking gets got oh and like she would also
1352960	1358080	my balance she would just also just like blow up shit in class it was great I want English
1358080	1368640	teacher who uses all the laptops to see torrenting wait like after we collided yes yes bad Sean of
1368640	1375680	the dead great movie yeah I think did you ever watch to see the Jenna Nicholson video on the
1375680	1383120	One Direction X the Purse fan no I have to watch that work hard play harder yeah part is that should
1383120	1392640	be my my tagline your ex thought those movies were peak romance oh my god it's so bad that's toxic
1392640	1399040	is hell the main kiss so okay so let me explain to you what the after series is it is a One Direction
1399040	1406080	fan fiction where the main character is a self-insert of the author and she is in love with Harry
1406080	1412320	Styles except imagine Harry Styles having an alcoholic dad having an alcoholic problem of his own
1413040	1425440	being only like 18 or 17 uh beating people up doing drugs um imagine also having really bad anger
1425440	1435600	issues imagine uh uh Lewis and Zane and all the other ones as like side characters that try to
1435600	1444080	romance her but they're also toxic as hell exactly boomy um it was bad it was so bad like
1444080	1451360	it's so toxic like they'll just like you know like when you watch a romance movie and like the main
1451360	1456640	couple get like upset with each other but you know it easily could have been solved if they just like
1457280	1464320	said what was on their mind instead of or like asking for clarification because that was the
1464400	1471840	entire movie they just miscommunication between three movies hello hello welcome in
1473280	1478800	and oh you know a personal you know i i do like love the twilight movies when i say i love the
1478800	1483520	twilight movies i mean i've only seen like the first two and i need to watch the others because
1483520	1488320	it's a thing that me and my friend used to do every year where we would mute the twilight movie
1488880	1494240	and we would just dub over it with our own voices and pretend to know what was going on in the scene

3463840	3476240	Okay it's important to do it only when it's close.
3476240	3493200	Oh fuck I ran past one.
3500560	3502480	There is a light shell it's right there.
3503040	3506640	I might actually wait you can't reach me if I'm up here.
3508720	3510960	Ah bitch come closer.
3513440	3517440	Why don't you get around that little thing so I can do this.
3526640	3527840	We're just gonna look at each other.
3528800	3532800	He has some beautiful eyes. They have a certain glow to them. Did you know that?
3541360	3543200	I can literally kind of cheese him like this.
3543920	3547360	Just stay up here and every time I like land a hit on him
3548320	3554400	I get more umami but that would just take forever though.
3558480	3560480	You're so beautiful I can't stop looking at you.
3561840	3562720	Hold on let me look at chat.
3563520	3566480	I know the parry yet should be obvious in the game once you unlock it though.
3566480	3568240	I thought the parry is the shell.
3572400	3574720	Am I playing a mage? I'm a crap.
3574800	3580160	Cheat strat. I can't run past them the place is blocked.
3580720	3582240	How would I run past the boss?
3584480	3589680	I wonder if this one will glitch like the other one did and just let me hit my little heart
3589680	3591520	and let me um pass.
3591520	3611920	Can I have this? Why are you stuck to me?
3612560	3621520	I'm gonna die. I need to run into a can.
3624960	3626080	Oh that's the one that's broken.
3629120	3632320	Where's the other can?
3632320	3647520	Oh god what does this one do? What's the pop-off do I forget?
3650000	3658720	I rolled. Oh I hate it here.
3659600	3663040	I don't even know what the fuck pop-off even does.
3663840	3669120	Just fucking kill me. I don't even care at this point.
3673360	3674880	This should only let you guard her first.
3675840	3678080	Are you serious? Why don't they let me parry right away?
3679520	3682640	I'm starting to get angry because I suck. I need to get good.
3685040	3687040	Okay so there's one right there, one right there.
3687120	3692400	So I got one, two, three, four chances.
3696000	3697120	I can also run up here.
3704320	3707440	Like this is also a spot I can like run away from.
3707440	3718720	I like wasted it though.
3725360	3726400	Can I hit you?
3728640	3732240	Okay you can still hit me up here but not that well though.
3737440	3746560	Is this a strat? Keep him in the corner.
3750160	3751040	I think it's a strat.
3754480	3756720	Yep it's a strat.
3757600	3774000	I am in the map.
3780000	3782720	It could be one of those bosses you're gonna come back later when you're powerful enough.
3782720	3785920	No it's not. This is where I need to go to progress.
3791920	3795120	I forgot I just like jumped down one time. Oh I fucked myself.
3796000	3800240	I fucked myself my last run because oh I don't even fucking give a shit anymore.
3805040	3806640	I think this is the cheese strat.
3807520	3822560	Thrust is so hard to say through a wall. All right come here big boy.
3831920	3834320	If he jumps you can make it up there.
3836880	3857920	Come here. Come over here. Come here. Get over here please.
3858160	3867200	Haha you fucking miss bitch. Suck my titties.
3880560	3883200	Oh buddy.
3883200	3886480	Oh.
3895600	3908480	Then he'll usually go at me with that. Okay.
3913360	3922480	You're a crab not a scorpion.
3924160	3927120	Seems like the game wants you to get good at dodging heavy attacks.
3927120	3938480	Well I'm not going to so this is how I play.
3943440	3952480	Did I or did I not roll out of the fucking way for that? What the fuck is my hitbox dude?
3961520	3966480	See you just fucked myself again.
3974160	3978480	Remember the fives of dodgeball? I watched that movie again recently.
3989840	3991600	Fives of dodgeball be a pussy.
3992240	4004800	Is there like lag to when I fucking dodge?
4007440	4010880	I am really pressing the fucking roll button.
4012240	4018880	You actual fucking cocksucker. I swear to...
4022560	4028880	Get out of my face. Get out of my fucking face.
4039360	4046880	Come closer.
4051920	4057040	Sorry I'm a mad.
4062320	4063200	I ran into that.
4067840	4071440	I'm a little confused because
4072160	4079120	my shell doesn't take the brunt of the heavy attack.
4080240	4083760	When he goes into a second phase he just kills me.
4085280	4089360	When it's in his first phase and he does a heavy attack it just breaks my shell.
4090160	4096720	I don't quite understand that.
4102400	4105280	I need an audio or mad. I'm as mad as that or more.
4108480	4116400	Like I usually don't like playing souls likes on stream because I get really angry
4118000	4125360	and I personally don't think it's the funnest gameplay to watch to just watch someone be angry
4125520	4131920	and not be good at a game. Like if you're like angry and then you like kill the boss in your
4131920	4136080	third try you'd be like all right that's pretty sick. But it's like when it's like 20 tries in
4136080	4143040	and you're like what the fuck like I remember I had a like that stupid clown boss from Lies of P
4143680	4150320	took me like three hours of trying in a stream ended up spiking my headphones and breaking
4150320	4155360	them and smashing them through my controller on the ground almost broke my monitor
4157760	4164320	and then in the next two runs I finally beat him but I did that all off stream
4165120	4167200	because I didn't want anybody to see
4167760	4178160	because it's you it's unfortunate training
4183600	4187920	I'm good as long you're having good time well like no like I'm enjoying myself playing like
4187920	4193120	because I like I don't mind Ragey games like this it's just that I personally can't watch somebody
4193120	4198960	play it with something because in my head I tend to backseat and I get frustrated I'm like just
4198960	4202480	fucking beat like you could have just done that there you couldn't like that's how I like watch
4202480	4207360	people who play these games so I get mad watching people play these games and they suck at them
4207360	4213200	like me because like I would go back and watch my vlogs and I'm like I'm such a fucking idiot where
4213200	4217600	the fuck did I do that all right
4223920	4235600	hmm
4241760	4243600	okay he clips through that so I don't want to
4245680	4250320	I like I literally will jump and it takes forever I'm like is it my controller
4250960	4255280	I have like a fucking Thunderbolt C so it's not like is it the cable I don't
4256560	4262800	why is there such a delay in my like I'm pressing stuff before it happens and then it happens a second later
4262800	4273280	so
4287200	4290720	at least you get stuck on that little embankment so I can chill for a second
4293760	4298160	huh uh I just choked on my spit
4303200	4305600	do you have dead zones on what's that
4310400	4314480	I didn't feel like there was a delay when I was playing so it could be an issue
4315280	4321840	controller dead zones can delay you I don't know what that means
4322800	4328880	maybe we should hit the boss a little bit then back away hit him again thanks Sachiko aren't you
4328880	4336720	a fucking genius bro it's medium weight dodge roll is it is it really the dodge roll
4336960	4342080	yo how you been snowflake this is what the fuck I'm not icy
4342960	4345920	dead zones are like how far you move the stick until registers an input
4347120	4350400	maybe it's a ps5 controller
4361600	4363040	okay he's kind of stuck on that
4363040	4369200	how the how the fuck did he run after me so fast
4370720	4371520	okay he's on this
4374160	4377760	he's on the piercing part of his face

4852880	4862080	waterline sensual body of the snail hi uh thanks for leaving me here I think the duchess is
4862080	4869840	really gonna like this pearl but I still need a way to get out of this cave in order to progress
4869840	4874160	the hermit crab will need to further expand on its omami abilities
4875840	4879280	I don't think I can do the ash catching voice it's creating my my throat
4880160	4883200	cool how do I do that I'm getting to a dam
4888880	4895920	I mean um the hermit crab closes his eyes and allows himself to become one with the waves
4896560	4901680	he notices the effect on his body has on I can't read the currents around him
4902480	4906400	and lets himself be changed by them in turn okay
4909520	4916560	hey when I close my eyes I can start to see something I see a tree some sort of tree of skills
4916720	4920240	shell deportation oh
4924160	4929360	I have every single thing leaves currents in the wake in its wake why can't I read today
4930640	4934480	as it travels through his ocean this ocean I have dyslexia
4937360	4942320	be it a living person a beast a corpse but even a piece of garbage
4942800	4947280	gabbage the life force of the ocean the beating heart of this world
4948080	4954960	this phenomenon is known as umami invisible to most umami currents can be detected only
4954960	4963520	by chosen few excuse me even fewer still can make use of them oh the glowing purple stuff
4964240	4967040	I've seen that surrounding some big shells and crystals out there
4968000	4971440	surprising I guess I didn't you know zap you that I mean um
4972720	4976240	the hermit crab's training may progress faster than anticipated
4977040	4983440	he feels that perhaps if he enters a discarded moon snail shell a new use for it's might reveal itself
4989600	4993200	the dyslexia whose dyslexia must be a baddie
4994080	4998880	yeah that was that was the snail that wasn't me guys
5002880	5005760	you can read not really shell deporting
5009360	5015120	that's the same sound I swear that's used by

5098800	5107760	but I feel like maybe if I because I think I went into the game expecting I guess Scott
5107760	5114320	because I've never played any game like I never played um uh well I did play like dragon age
5114320	5121760	inquisition I didn't like it either um I didn't I thought balder's gate would play more like
5122320	5129760	like skyrim does or like oblivion and it doesn't I'm not a huge fan of turn-based games the only
5130480	5134880	like turn-based game I'm a fan of is fire emblem three houses

5564640	5575040	actually I didn't like beat Elden Ring in a short amount of time I did it in like 150 hours or more
5580240	5581200	it's like a long clam
5584160	5587280	oh uh can you not kill me oh

5620240	5621760	even know how I jumped on the sword
5624720	5628800	to be fair Elden Ring dodge is better than this game here you're supposed to block parry more
5628800	5635440	than dodge it seems like it Elden Ring isn't a cleverly disguised platformer now that's
5635440	5642640	eyes of pee those lobsters were using straws isn't that enough straw sample player second power
5642640	5644880	oh I have to go around see this crab

6519600	6543600	Alright, I just want to know how this works.
6543600	6555600	I can't go that way.
6555600	6561600	Go fucking run!
6561600	6583600	You're gone for a sentence for you to run in.
6583600	6587600	You know what it locks? I don't even have to do anything.
6587600	6591600	Give me that.
6591600	6594600	What is this?

6604600	6613600	Why can't I?
6613600	6616600	I can't shoot him.
6616600	6621600	It wouldn't let me lock on.
6621600	6628600	Wait, wait, hold on. Can you come back?
6628600	6632600	It literally is a one hit kill.
6632600	6636600	Alright, I'm ready to face the boss.
6636600	6638600	That's for sure.
6638600	6643600	Oh, I can't fucking jump though.
6643600	6648600	Wait, let me...
6648600	6650600	I'm a battle crab.
6650600	6652600	Let me swap real quick.
6652600	6656600	I'll grab the- I don't know how a gun works underwater.
6656600	6660600	Come on, I can't make that.
6660600	6666600	Perfect.
6666600	6668600	Oh, sick.
6668600	6678600	Where do I- is this a-
6678600	6680600	Oh, that's cool.
6680600	6684600	Kind of just kamikaze yourself.
6684600	6689600	Alright, grab that gun.
6689600	6696600	Nice. I don't know how I can pull the trigger.
6696600	6699600	Are you alive?
6699600	6703600	You fucking dead? Oh my god, he's fucking dead.
6703600	6705600	Alright, bitch.
6705600	6714600	I'm fucking ready.
6714600	6716600	What is wrong with you?
6716600	6723600	What the fuck?
6723600	6728600	Oh, shuck.
6728600	6735600	Did you see the gun in my ass in the cutscene?
6735600	6740600	Is oil making all the animals crazy?
6740600	6741600	The fish crazy?
6741600	6755600	The crustacean's crazy.
6755600	6763600	Well, I have a fucking gun, so...
6764600	6780600	All of our lives are a sand beneath the tide. You'll see.
6780600	6784600	I didn't think it would one-shot her.
6784600	6786600	I didn't think it would one-shot her.
6786600	6789600	I thought it would take a bunch of hits on her.
6789600	6803600	At least five or something.
6803600	6805600	Holy abalone!
6805600	6811600	That was a show of a fight, kid, was it?
6811600	6813600	You were watching the whole thing?
6813600	6817600	I guess it was too much to ask the soldiers caught you, jerk.
6817600	6821600	No such luck. I hit as soon as everyone started going crazy.
6821600	6823600	Who the fuck is controlling me?
6823600	6827600	That's the five I never picked a fight he doesn't have up to.
6827600	6830600	He could learn a thing or two from a guy like me.
6830600	6833600	Well, now the judges says, you know...
6833600	6836600	So give me my shot back. You have no reason to keep anymore, right?
6836600	6841600	Huh, this whole thing, you know, I can barely remember how I got my fins on it anymore.
6841600	6844600	Thinkin' I might just go pawn this off in the big city?
6844600	6846600	Make myself a few microplastics?
6846600	6849600	What? What? You can't do that!
6849600	6852600	I will shoot you into the motherfucking gun.
6852600	6855600	You're using a human-sized gun and a crab.
6855600	6857600	I think it's gonna one-shot her.
6857600	6861600	And that's how you afford a fake taxes.
6861600	6865600	It's the gun I described earlier, about 100% chance of incident.
6865600	6867600	Oh!
6867600	6869600	Excuse me. Oh, so I can do anything he wants.
6869600	6871600	He's gonna get away with, kid.
6871600	6874600	See me a new carcinia.
6874600	6876600	Carcinia.
6876600	6879600	English. If you wanna buy this bad boy back from me.
6879600	6882600	If no one else buys it first, that is.
6882600	6884600	No!
6884600	6887600	When I get my hands on that guy, I swear, I don't have hands, I have claws.
6887600	6890600	I swear I'm gonna shoot him.
6892600	6895600	You have wearing your first adaptation attack.
6895600	6899600	Wearing from a powerful creature that can be used without even a shell equipped.
6899600	6902600	Okay, my cat is looking at my foot.
6904600	6907600	Raina, what are you doing?
6907600	6909600	Okay.
6909600	6911600	Oh, that's not it.
6911600	6914600	The fuck? Where did this come from?
6919600	6921600	Oh.
6921600	6923600	Cool.
6923600	6925600	Okay, but it needs to.
6928600	6930600	Alright.
6934600	6936600	She be in the hood.
6938600	6940600	Let me put the gun away.
6942600	6945600	I feel like I just cheated. I didn't think that was gonna happen.
6945600	6948600	It's fine. I probably would have cried for five hours anyways.
6948600	6951600	Gonna cheese the whole game with the gun.
6951600	6953600	I'm tempted to.
6953600	6955600	But I won't.
6960600	6963600	How does this stay on my ass?
6964600	6966600	Alright.
6982600	6985600	I'm just gonna turn that off.
6989600	6991600	Can I go back? Okay.
6991600	6993600	I need a...
7003600	7007600	So, can you hear my controller click when I'm like...
7007600	7010600	That's like the timing is...
7010600	7013600	Literally like a half a second off.
7018600	7021600	So, I'm seeing it putting up the settings.
7021600	7023600	Yeah, exactly. That's why I'm like...
7023600	7026600	I'm like, guys, I swear to you, I'm not usually this bad.
7026600	7030600	Like, I decently got through Lies of Pea
7030600	7034600	and Elden Ring. It's just such as a fucking delay.
7035600	7039600	If I put it up to 200, it will happen.
7052600	7055600	I can't even tell if that's any better.
7055600	7058600	Maybe PC is better? Let me see.
7071600	7073600	That is a little bit better.
7073600	7075600	How do I...
7077600	7080600	Yeah, it's actually a lot more responsive on PC.
7080600	7085600	But Jesus fuck, it changes my mouse sensitivity to the fucking moon.
7103600	7105600	Can I please fucking scroll down?
7105600	7107600	Can I please scroll down?
7110600	7113600	Tap the... What the fuck are these tap...
7113600	7115600	These fucking bindings.
7124600	7128600	I can't even use... I can't even use the buttons on the side of my mouse.
7128600	7131600	Oh, Jesus fuck.
7135600	7137600	Turn the arm on, see it.
7140600	7142600	Okay.
7157600	7160600	I feel like it's a little bit better.
7163600	7165600	No, it's not.
7166600	7169600	The dodge is better but the attack isn't.
7170600	7172600	Okay.
7176600	7180600	No, literally when you turn on this game it says it's best with a controller.
7183600	7187600	Have you considered simply getting good as the kids say?
7187600	7190600	You're only as good as your equipment.
7190600	7191600	That's what they say.
7191600	7193600	Skins equals wins.
7193600	7195600	Counter strike.
7195600	7199600	My need to assign it the mouse down column to the keyboard one.
7203600	7205600	Let me try that.
7208600	7212600	Because I'll play with keyboard if that works, if it's better then.
7222600	7224600	Actually...
7225600	7227600	...
7233600	7235600	Jesus fuck.
7245600	7248600	You always run faster with a knife.
7249600	7251600	Boobs counts as equip.
7251600	7253600	Holy moly.
7254600	7256600	Yes, you like my equipment?
7256600	7259600	You like my equipment?
7273600	7276600	Actually, I would prefer...
7277600	7279600	...
7280600	7283600	... because I'm thinking about how I play...
7284600	7286600	... FPS games.
7286600	7288600	...
7303600	7306600	The fuck was left control being used for?
7308600	7310600	Heal, that's fine.
7310600	7312600	F, that's fine.
7312600	7314600	Shell spell.
7317600	7320600	Okay, I was going to use Q for that, but Q's already there.
7321600	7323600	Hammer.
7324600	7326600	Folk, oh, focus.
7327600	7329600	What the fuck, hammer?
7333600	7336600	What the fuck is C being used for?
7337600	7340600	C's not being used for anything, am I blind?
7346600	7348600	...
7359600	7361600	God, why the fuck am I...
7361600	7363600	Why is my eye burning?
7372600	7374600	That's not what I fucking pressed!
7374600	7376600	No!
7385600	7387600	Actually...
7391600	7393600	Yeah, whatever.
7398600	7401600	It doesn't have any, like, mouse sensitivity.
7402600	7404600	Oh, turn that off.
7404600	7406600	Everything's off!
7413600	7415600	What?
7416600	7418600	Oh, my fucking god.
7424600	7427600	It took the mouse right thing as, like...
7428600	7432600	I can't move my fucking camera, even though I didn't press mouse right.
7434600	7436600	Shell spell on C?
7438600	7440600	I really want some crab legs now.
7448600	7451600	Please, for the love of god, let me move down.
7458600	7460600	Oh.
7463600	7465600	What?
7469600	7472600	Just because I moved my mouse to the...
7473600	7475600	Jesus.
7476600	7478600	What is m-
7479600	7481600	What?
7481600	7483600	What?
7488600	7490600	Game is weird.
7495600	7497600	Okay.
7498600	7500600	Let me just...
7508600	7510600	I put...
7511600	7515600	I don't like using keyboard in a game like this,
7515600	7518600	because I literally... it takes me forever to, like, get the...
7518600	7520600	bindings I want.
7522600	7524600	Why is that?
7524600	7526600	It was using this as a sprint.
7536600	7538600	Okay.
7541600	7543600	Okay, whatever.
7546600	7548600	You guys, you guys hang in there?
7548600	7551600	Do you have a controller plugged into a USB header,
7551600	7553600	in the case of the motherboard?
7553600	7555600	It's on the motherboard,
7555600	7557600	and it's USB-C it's plugged into,
7557600	7559600	so that's why I'm like, what the fuck?
7562600	7564600	Ooh, give me that.
7576600	7579600	You know what I should have done? I should have leveled up.
7584600	7586600	Can I go back to that moonshell?
7591600	7594600	You guys are chilling? You're dead? I'm so sorry.
7594600	7596600	No loss.
7596600	7598600	No loss there.
7599600	7601600	No one will miss you.
7605600	7607600	Okay.
7611600	7613600	PC of Bluetooth.
7613600	7615600	I don't think it does.
7615600	7619600	I feel like even if it was Bluetooth, it wouldn't make a difference.
7635600	7637600	If I...
7642600	7644600	If I...
7650600	7653600	So I have to go to the lady to do my skill tree?
7657600	7659600	Yes, for sure.
7659600	7661600	Hello.
7662600	7664600	I don't think a spirit could type,
7664600	7667600	but well, maybe if it's a talented spirit.
7672600	7674600	You have steam input enabled?
7675600	7677600	I don't know.
7682600	7684600	I don't know where that setting would be.
7685600	7688600	I usually... I've never had that enabled that I know of.
7688600	7690600	I don't need to talk to you, I just need to...
7691600	7693600	Do I need to talk to you to upgrade stuff?
7694600	7696600	Am I just going here to do that?
7700600	7702600	No?
7703600	7705600	Okay, I guess I have to talk to you.
7707600	7709600	I guess you're the Sophia in this game.
7718600	7720600	Oh!
7722600	7724600	Cool.
7728600	7730600	That's pretty smart.
7735600	7737600	Fashion night in?
7746600	7750600	Hmm, these are all really good skills to use.
7751600	7753600	Yeah.
7757600	7759600	That's cool, actually.
7762600	7765600	I think I might do the free...
7765600	7767600	Actually, I'll do that, yeah.
7772600	7774600	I hate playing on keyboard, though.
7775600	7777600	Phew.
7778600	7780600	You have the same utility disabled it?
7780600	7782600	Oh.
7783600	7785600	Pushing to Bluetooth, which I helped you.
7786600	7788600	Where is this... where is steam input?
7788600	7790600	Where would that setting be?
7791600	7792600	Sorry, I'm stupid.
7792600	7793600	Sorry, I'm blonde.
7793600	7795600	Where would this be input setting be?
7804600	7806600	Hmm.
7819600	7821600	Oh, shit, I just realized what time it was.
7825600	7830600	I am gonna end it here for now.
7831600	7834600	I think Amy's on doing stuff.
7835600	7837600	Let me save.
7843600	7846600	I don't know if I'm gonna keep playing this game.
7848600	7852600	The whole thing with the controls is kind of irritating.
7853600	7855600	But if you guys really want me to continue...
7855600	7863600	Oh, yeah, she's designing a 2.0 outfit or something.
7867600	7869600	And then...
7869600	7871600	Bye, big sis.
7871600	7873600	Yeah, I'm gonna send you to little sis.
7881600	7883600	I was just starting to enjoy this.
7883600	7884600	Damn.
7884600	7886600	If you guys really want me to continue it, I will.
7888600	7891600	It's like clamoring for it.
7892600	7893600	Maybe I will.
7893600	7894600	I don't know.
7894600	7896600	I probably won't play it next week, maybe the week after.
7897600	7899600	I like the game.
7899600	7904600	Again, I don't like being irritated and frustrated with the game's mechanics on stream.
7907600	7908600	Maybe a gun run?
7908600	7910600	No, that'd be too fucking easy.
7910600	7914600	I don't want to make it easy.
7914600	7921600	I'm generally mad that I killed the Duchess in one shot.
7923600	7927600	I thought it would take at least two, three, or four or five shots.
7929600	7931600	I feel like such a fucking dirty cheater.
7931600	7932600	I'm mad at myself.
7932600	7944600	Just like when the weird bug that the first boss you fight just disappeared on me and didn't show back up.
7945600	7947600	And everybody treated it like I killed it.
7947600	7949600	But I'm like, he just leapt.
7949600	7951600	He didn't want to talk to me anymore.
7952600	7954600	What the fuck is on my arm?
7958600	7961600	Yeah, the controls are rushing.
7962600	7963600	That's the most anticlimactic.
7963600	7964600	What do you think that happened?
7964600	7965600	I know.
7965600	7966600	I'm like, okay.
7966600	7968600	I was like righty coming up with another strat.
7968600	7972600	I'm like, okay, I just got to like bring him in a circle, be able to jump in a can for a shell.
7972600	7974600	And then he just never showed up.
7974600	7977600	He never showed up for the fight.
7977600	7979600	I fear you're a maiden list.
7980600	7983600	I don't have any sort of maiden list behavior.
7985600	7986600	Downloading.
7986600	7987600	I'm lost to my phone right now.
7987600	7988600	Also hi, hi.
7992600	7993600	Yeah, going on and off.
7993600	7995600	Like, yeah, I might play this a little bit on the side.
7995600	7997600	I have Sekiro.
7997600	7998600	Heroes die twice.
7998600	7999600	So maybe I'll play that.
7999600	8002600	I'm trying to think of some games to play for next week.
8004600	8006600	I'm thinking about doing some collabs next week.
8006600	8007600	It's frustrating.
8007600	8013600	I have to miss out on a possible collab with the girls next week because I have to work at my normal job again.
8015600	8016600	Sekiro, yeah, I only got.
8016600	8020600	So Sekiro was the first friend like Soulslight game I ever played.
8020600	8023600	And I didn't know what Soulslikes were like.
8023600	8025600	I didn't know it was a Soulslight.
8025600	8028600	I didn't, I didn't, I never had played Dark Souls or anything.
8029600	8042600	And I remember, like, I never got past the first boss, like the first duty fight, because I was, I was just getting so pissed and angry.
8042600	8043600	I'm like.
8046600	8047600	Thank you, Mama.
8050600	8052600	I'm glad you liked it. It was kind of funny.
8052600	8054600	I can't, I want a clip of that.
8055600	8059600	Just like of me getting the gun and being like, wait, let's see how this works.
8059600	8061600	And just fucking one shot.
8062600	8063600	It's good.
8065600	8066600	Play Dark Souls too.
8066600	8067600	Yeah.
8067600	8069600	Yeah, let me know what, like, I also have Liza P.
8069600	8072600	I wouldn't mind playing through Liza P again.
8072600	8073600	On stream.
8075600	8077600	That's a game I really enjoyed.
8080600	8081600	Yeah.
8083600	8085600	Curl becoming an American moment.
8085600	8090600	I wish there was like dialogue, though, like when you added that, like when you got, when you got the gun.
8092600	8094600	I wish you would like, say something.
8094600	8098600	Like, really, really, like, really awkwardly political.
8100600	8105600	Like, they may get my taxes, but they'll never take my gun right away.
8105600	8107600	There's some shit like that.
8107600	8108600	Play Doom.
8108600	8110600	The new Doom game that's coming out looks good.
8110600	8113600	I, like, I, I was like, holy shit, that looks good.
8113600	8115600	I haven't, I've never played Doom.
8115600	8117600	I've never played Doom.
8117600	8118600	I've never played Doom.
8118600	8119600	I've never played Doom.
8119600	8121600	I've never played Doom.
8121600	8123600	I was like, holy shit, that looks good.
8123600	8124600	I have, I've never played Doom.
8124600	8125600	I'll be honest with you.
8125600	8126600	I've never played a Doom game.
8126600	8128600	I've always wanted to play a Doom game.
8128600	8131600	My dad, I think, played the OG Doom game.
8132600	8138600	I've watched people play Doom, and I do like, shoot him up.
8139600	8142600	This should make us be gonna make sure we text an accent.
8142600	8143600	Yeah.
8143600	8145600	Peak America is Texas.
8145600	8150600	Can't wait for that state to just secede from our country and become the country of Texas.
8151600	8152600	Or something.
8153600	8157600	I don't care who the IRS is saying, I'm not paying my taxes.
8157600	8159600	It's fucking WAPOW.
8159600	8161600	Shoot some.
8161600	8163600	Hell yeah, brother.
8164600	8168600	Okay, let me make sure my redirect's good, and I'll send you on over to Sweet Emmy.
8168600	8176600	Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom.
8176600	8177600	Yay.
8179600	8180600	Okay, that is cool.
8182600	8183600	Designing group 2.0.
8183600	8189600	I love how the thumbnail is Twilight Sparkle yelling at something.
8189600	8200600	I might be, I'm cooking something behind the scenes for my 2.0.
8201600	8204600	Actually, it's not even a 2.0, it's more of a 1.5.
8205600	8211600	But that won't be for until maybe next year.
8212600	8219600	No, maybe it'll be a 2.5 if I get a 2.0 by like the end of the year.
8220600	8221600	I don't know.
8221600	8222600	Who knows?
8222600	8224600	I do like this model.
8225600	8227600	I mostly just want more toggles.
8227600	8234600	And I was telling Azura pointed out that we actually are missing a vowel when we talk.
8234600	8242600	Which is, because you got A, E, I, O, U, but U doesn't work.
8242600	8246600	So I do U, U, U, my mouth isn't open.
8248600	8249600	So it's weird.
8251600	8254600	Yeah, Nari did a great job rigging.
8257600	8258600	Yeah.
8261600	8263600	Gould did a great job designing.
8265600	8269600	Well, thank you for the tips guys.
8271600	8275600	I hope you have a great rest of your day or night and hanging out with Emmy.
8276600	8283600	I also hope you suck a dick because, you know, you're trash and all, so.
8284600	8286600	It's all that trash is good for.
8287600	8288600	Sucking peepie.
8289600	8290600	Lots of love.
8290600	8291600	XOXO.
8291600	8293600	Madam Sheeby.
8318600	8320600	You guys still smell bad though.
