01:28:44,000 --> 01:29:04,000
You

220
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:24,000
You

221
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:44,000
You

222
01:29:44,000 --> 01:30:04,000
You

223
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:20,000
You

224
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:32,000
You

225
01:30:32,000 --> 01:31:00,000
You

226
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:20,000
You

227
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:48,000
You

228
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:58,000
You

229
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:08,000
You

230
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:16,000
You

231
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:36,000
You

232
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:44,000
You

233
01:32:44,000 --> 01:33:04,000
You

234
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:12,000
You

235
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:32,000
You

236
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:52,000
You

237
01:33:52,000 --> 01:34:20,000
You

238
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:30,000
You

239
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:48,000
You

240
01:34:48,000 --> 01:35:08,000
You

241
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
You

242
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
You

243
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
You

244
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
You

245
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:26,000
You

246
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:36,000
You

247
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:46,000
You

248
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:52,000
You

249
01:35:52,000 --> 01:36:04,000
You

250
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:14,000
You

251
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:24,000
You

252
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:32,000
You

253
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:52,000
You

254
01:36:52,000 --> 01:37:00,000
You

255
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:10,000
You

256
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:20,000
You

257
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:28,000
You

258
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:36,000
You

259
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:42,000
You

260
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:48,000
You

261
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:56,000
You

262
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:57,800
I think I'm going to keep raising my vigor.

263
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:09,440
Yeah, the OSTs are great.

264
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:10,520
She be going ham.

265
01:38:10,520 --> 01:38:11,680
She be is not going ham.

266
01:38:11,680 --> 01:38:15,280
She be is just trying to get her bearings on the DLC.

267
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:32,440
Yeah, let me aggro you first.

268
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:44,040
I'm stuck.

269
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:57,360
This is just poop water.

270
01:38:57,360 --> 01:39:00,680
Not resin.

271
01:39:00,680 --> 01:39:01,680
It's not resin.

272
01:39:01,680 --> 01:39:09,240
That's what I'm telling you right now.

273
01:39:09,240 --> 01:39:10,440
How did that?

274
01:39:10,440 --> 01:39:11,720
Look how much health he has.

275
01:39:11,720 --> 01:39:15,920
That doesn't make any sense to me.

276
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:17,960
Let me go and do flasks fairly quickly.

277
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:27,840
Well, I don't want to just simply run through anybody.

278
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:28,720
What is that?

279
01:39:28,720 --> 01:39:30,360
Oh, that's good to see.

280
01:39:33,320 --> 01:39:34,560
Discs of light.

281
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:36,680
OK, there's a well.

282
01:39:36,680 --> 01:39:39,840
So I can either go through the well or I can.

283
01:39:41,720 --> 01:39:44,720
Let me just take that.

284
01:39:44,720 --> 01:39:45,720
Keep going down.

285
01:39:56,720 --> 01:39:59,720
Are you guys coming some close to me?

286
01:39:59,720 --> 01:40:00,400
Go away.

287
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:05,480
No, I don't like this.

288
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:06,480
Ah.

289
01:40:15,480 --> 01:40:18,480
How do you guys have silver horn tender?

290
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:19,480
Interesting.

291
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:32,000
Sorry, you were just staring at me.

292
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:33,480
You were just minding your own business.

293
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:37,480
Interesting.

294
01:40:41,480 --> 01:40:43,480
Why are you crying?

295
01:40:43,480 --> 01:40:44,480
Mesmer fire.

296
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:45,480
Interesting.

297
01:40:53,480 --> 01:40:55,480
That's not a door I can go through.

298
01:40:55,480 --> 01:40:59,480
Do you want me to put you out of your misery?

299
01:40:59,480 --> 01:41:00,480
I miss.

300
01:41:01,480 --> 01:41:10,480
Wasted perfectly good stuff on that.

301
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:12,480
Why is this over here?

302
01:41:15,480 --> 01:41:16,480
I'll die.

303
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:18,480
Well, I had a feeling I looked down the wall.

304
01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:21,480
I thought I was going to be really fall.

305
01:41:21,480 --> 01:41:23,480
That's why I didn't.

306
01:41:23,480 --> 01:41:27,480
Oh, I probably shouldn't be standing here.

307
01:41:27,480 --> 01:41:28,480
Yeah.

308
01:41:31,480 --> 01:41:32,480
Great.

309
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:34,480
Here are the magicians.

310
01:41:43,480 --> 01:41:45,480
Got to drink my milk.

311
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:51,480
That's some good milk.

312
01:41:51,480 --> 01:41:52,480
All right.

313
01:41:55,480 --> 01:41:57,480
Again, I know I can run past everyone,

314
01:41:57,480 --> 01:42:01,480
but sometimes I just want to enjoy my song.

315
01:42:01,480 --> 01:42:03,480
I want to explore, you know?

316
01:42:15,480 --> 01:42:17,480
Hi, kitty.

317
01:42:17,480 --> 01:42:18,480
Hi, kitty.

318
01:42:18,480 --> 01:42:20,480
Hi, baby kitty.

319
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:31,480
I'm like, now I have to actually play.

320
01:42:31,480 --> 01:42:34,480
When it was just regular Elden Ring,

321
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:36,480
I knew what I was doing the entire time,

322
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:40,480
but now I want to sit and explore and do stuff and mess up.

323
01:42:45,480 --> 01:42:48,480
Well, you're going to keep arguing me.

324
01:42:48,480 --> 01:42:51,480
You're going to run over here.

325
01:42:51,480 --> 01:42:54,480
Not that there's any rooms.

326
01:42:55,480 --> 01:42:57,480
Let's just run past everyone.

327
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:03,480
I'm stuck.

328
01:43:03,480 --> 01:43:04,480
I'm stuck.

329
01:43:04,480 --> 01:43:05,480
I'm stuck.

330
01:43:05,480 --> 01:43:06,480
I'm stuck.

331
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:07,480
What was I stuck on?

332
01:43:07,480 --> 01:43:09,480
I was a dude sitting there.

333
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:10,480
What?

334
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:13,480
I'm being actually this, like, gang.

335
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:17,480
I think there was a dude sitting there,

336
01:43:17,480 --> 01:43:20,480
and I was stuck on him when I tried to roll out.

337
01:43:21,480 --> 01:43:24,480
Roll out.

338
01:43:27,480 --> 01:43:29,480
No, don't say that.

339
01:43:29,480 --> 01:43:31,480
That's terrible.

340
01:43:37,480 --> 01:43:38,480
Stop it.

341
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:39,480
Get some help.

342
01:43:39,480 --> 01:43:41,480
Maybe I should go down the well.

343
01:43:44,480 --> 01:43:45,480
Ow.

344
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:50,480
How are they hitting me when I'm literally under the bridge?

345
01:43:52,480 --> 01:43:53,480
Ow.

346
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:56,480
No, no, no.

347
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:57,480
Why am I?

348
01:43:57,480 --> 01:44:00,480
I'm getting stuck right here every time.

349
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:05,480
I don't want to have to kill you guys.

350
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:11,480
The lads on tour.

351
01:44:11,480 --> 01:44:13,480
That's what's going on in this area.

352
01:44:13,480 --> 01:44:15,480
The lads on tour.

353
01:44:19,480 --> 01:44:21,480
Did she ever get the Twiggy cracked here?

354
01:44:21,480 --> 01:44:23,480
No, I did not.

355
01:44:25,480 --> 01:44:26,480
But I haven't really.

356
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:29,480
I've been using, like, buffing cracked tiers,

357
01:44:29,480 --> 01:44:32,480
so I'm not too worried about the rooms.

358
01:44:40,480 --> 01:44:42,480
Oh, yeah, they're all right here.

359
01:44:43,480 --> 01:44:44,480
Oh.

360
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:45,480
Ow.

361
01:44:47,480 --> 01:44:48,480
No.

362
01:44:48,480 --> 01:44:49,480
Wow!

363
01:44:49,480 --> 01:44:52,480
Is this where I just can't move forward at all?

364
01:44:56,480 --> 01:44:58,480
Okay, I have to.

365
01:44:58,480 --> 01:45:00,480
I guess I have to fight my way through.

366
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:08,480
This is stupid.

367
01:45:09,480 --> 01:45:12,480
Thank you for the super stash power, by the way.

368
01:45:14,480 --> 01:45:17,480
I didn't mean to do that.

369
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:28,480
All right, I'll run over here.

370
01:45:29,480 --> 01:45:32,480
And I'll kill these two dudes.

371
01:45:43,480 --> 01:45:44,480
Okay.

372
01:45:53,480 --> 01:45:56,480
Can I stay in here until they still hit me?

373
01:45:57,480 --> 01:45:58,480
Nope.

374
01:45:58,480 --> 01:46:00,480
I can't hit them.

375
01:46:09,480 --> 01:46:12,480
The glowing eyes on this one is funny.

376
01:46:14,480 --> 01:46:17,480
Okay, so they shouldn't be able to hit me now,

377
01:46:17,480 --> 01:46:19,480
and I can run up.

378
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:23,480
I'm just gonna grab this so I don't keep seeing it.

379
01:46:23,480 --> 01:46:24,480
Oh my god.

380
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:27,480
No.

381
01:46:27,480 --> 01:46:28,480
No.

382
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:30,480
What the hell?

383
01:46:32,480 --> 01:46:34,480
That's a stupid.

384
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:39,480
I keep getting, like, stuck in that, like,

385
01:46:39,480 --> 01:46:41,480
that's one side for some reason.

386
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:45,480
The shadow people are not playing.

387
01:46:45,480 --> 01:46:47,480
They're just, it's, they don't do,

388
01:46:47,480 --> 01:46:49,480
they do, they do quite a bit of damage.

389
01:46:49,480 --> 01:46:51,480
That's why I need to get that vigor up

390
01:46:51,480 --> 01:46:53,480
and get the Scat of Tree Fragment.

391
01:46:53,480 --> 01:46:55,480
Maybe I should get the Scat of Tree Fragment.

392
01:46:55,480 --> 01:46:56,480
No, Raina, Raina, please.

393
01:46:56,480 --> 01:46:58,480
You need to move.

394
01:47:03,480 --> 01:47:04,480
It's who you attack it as a buff,

395
01:47:04,480 --> 01:47:06,480
and you just let it keep runes upon death.

396
01:47:06,480 --> 01:47:08,480
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

397
01:47:09,480 --> 01:47:11,480
That's, I know, that's,

398
01:47:11,480 --> 01:47:13,480
I've been saying I've been using stuff to buff

399
01:47:13,480 --> 01:47:15,480
rather than stuff just to help.

400
01:47:19,480 --> 01:47:21,480
Yes, I know that that means that.

401
01:47:21,480 --> 01:47:22,480
They dropped the glowing.

402
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:24,480
Like, guys, I've played the game.

403
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:29,480
You don't have to tell me I have played the game.

404
01:47:34,480 --> 01:47:37,480
Raina, my darling, I'm so sorry, but you need to move.

405
01:47:40,480 --> 01:47:45,480
I can't have two cats, three cats on my desk.

406
01:47:47,480 --> 01:47:50,480
I need something, I need to use my...

407
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:01,480
Okay.

408
01:48:02,480 --> 01:48:03,480
Ow.

409
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:07,480
Why do they have such a long range?

410
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:30,480
Really, I'm not...

411
01:48:31,480 --> 01:48:32,480
Yeah.

412
01:48:39,480 --> 01:48:41,480
It's a really cool, I'm assuming that's an incantation

413
01:48:41,480 --> 01:48:43,480
because it seems like holy...

414
01:48:43,480 --> 01:48:44,480
Oh.

415
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:50,480
Why does that have such a long range?

416
01:48:53,480 --> 01:48:54,480
It's still hitting me.

417
01:48:57,480 --> 01:48:59,480
It's still going to hit me.

418
01:49:01,480 --> 01:49:03,480
I'm so sorry, gentlemen.

419
01:49:11,480 --> 01:49:14,480
Jesus Christ, I hate this.

420
01:49:16,480 --> 01:49:17,480
Oh my God.

421
01:49:17,480 --> 01:49:29,480
I've played the game before.

422
01:49:29,480 --> 01:49:31,480
It doesn't mean that I'm good at it.

423
01:49:33,480 --> 01:49:36,480
I haven't played the DLC, though.

424
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:38,480
Guys, this might take a bit.

425
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:40,480
Just telling you.

426
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:43,480
Might just take just a little bit.

427
01:49:44,480 --> 01:49:46,480
Why am I...

428
01:49:46,480 --> 01:49:48,480
Oh my God.

429
01:49:48,480 --> 01:49:49,480
Ah!

430
01:49:53,480 --> 01:49:55,480
Oh, a Knight Comet.

431
01:49:57,480 --> 01:49:59,480
What about Magical Blade?

432
01:49:59,480 --> 01:50:01,480
It doesn't matter.

433
01:50:02,480 --> 01:50:04,480
Or a Rocksling.

434
01:50:05,480 --> 01:50:07,480
I didn't do anything.

435
01:50:14,480 --> 01:50:16,480
I really should just sit back down.

436
01:50:16,480 --> 01:50:18,480
I don't know why.

437
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:24,480
Okay, thank you guys.

438
01:50:25,480 --> 01:50:27,480
You guys all had to go through it too.

439
01:50:27,480 --> 01:50:28,480
Sorry.

440
01:50:28,480 --> 01:50:31,480
Comet is effective, but the FP cost is just high.

441
01:50:33,480 --> 01:50:36,480
I think I might kind of just use...

442
01:50:36,480 --> 01:50:40,480
I'm going to use it only on the two dudes up top.

443
01:50:43,480 --> 01:50:46,480
Comet is pushing into sleep, and it's funny.

444
01:50:46,480 --> 01:50:49,480
You need to wait for him to come over.

445
01:51:14,480 --> 01:51:16,480
Come here.

446
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:17,480
You're walking mighty slow.

447
01:51:17,480 --> 01:51:20,480
Are you going to lunge forward there, bud?

448
01:51:20,480 --> 01:51:21,480
There you are.

449
01:51:21,480 --> 01:51:24,480
How do you have any health left?

450
01:51:24,480 --> 01:51:26,480
That's my question.

451
01:51:30,480 --> 01:51:32,480
Boomi, it's just rain.

452
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:35,480
Rain is playing in the tunnel, and Boomi set up so fast

453
01:51:35,480 --> 01:51:37,480
because you're the jingling.

454
01:51:38,480 --> 01:51:42,480
Sara, I need you to lay back down with your pouch.

455
01:51:43,480 --> 01:51:45,480
He just did a big stretch.

456
01:51:52,480 --> 01:51:54,480
My cats are thwarting me.

457
01:51:54,480 --> 01:51:56,480
Good boy, Boomi.

458
01:51:56,480 --> 01:51:57,480
Oh, perfect.

459
01:51:57,480 --> 01:51:58,480
Thank you.

460
01:51:59,480 --> 01:52:01,480
He just laid down.

461
01:52:07,480 --> 01:52:09,480
I can't cast fast enough.

462
01:52:21,480 --> 01:52:23,480
Why is it locking on him?

463
01:52:23,480 --> 01:52:24,480
Oh, my God.

464
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:26,480
It's fucking me up.

465
01:52:33,480 --> 01:52:35,480
Raina, are you okay?

466
01:52:38,480 --> 01:52:43,480
She's playing with her ball in the tunnels.

467
01:52:43,480 --> 01:52:45,480
It's like a tri-tunnel.

468
01:52:46,480 --> 01:52:48,480
Good night.

469
01:52:48,480 --> 01:52:50,480
Have a good night.

470
01:52:51,480 --> 01:52:54,480
I'm going to wait for them to walk over here, actually.

471
01:52:58,480 --> 01:53:00,480
Sara drew him.

472
01:53:01,480 --> 01:53:03,480
Yeah, bud.

473
01:53:03,480 --> 01:53:04,480
Oh, God.

474
01:53:07,480 --> 01:53:09,480
You are mighty annoying up there.

475
01:53:38,480 --> 01:53:41,480
No, this is not happening again.

476
01:53:41,480 --> 01:53:43,480
Are you serious?

477
01:53:49,480 --> 01:53:53,480
Guys, guys, I thought they were gone.

478
01:53:53,480 --> 01:53:55,480
I thought I got every one of them

479
01:53:55,480 --> 01:53:57,480
missing up the dude in the corner,

480
01:53:57,480 --> 01:53:59,480
but there was another one.

481
01:53:59,480 --> 01:54:01,480
Boomi was waiting indeed.

482
01:54:08,480 --> 01:54:09,480
No.

483
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:36,480
Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down.

484
01:54:38,480 --> 01:54:41,480
It's cool that there's a grace right here.

485
01:54:41,480 --> 01:54:43,480
That's interesting.

486
01:54:52,480 --> 01:54:54,480
What are you doing?

487
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:56,480
How did you aggro me?

488
01:54:56,480 --> 01:54:59,480
That's so crazy.

489
01:54:59,480 --> 01:55:01,480
I literally...

490
01:55:01,480 --> 01:55:03,480
What?

491
01:55:03,480 --> 01:55:06,480
Make that make any sort of sense.

492
01:55:07,480 --> 01:55:09,480
How did he just ran in?

493
01:55:09,480 --> 01:55:11,480
Did he hear me?

494
01:55:11,480 --> 01:55:13,480
I don't understand.

495
01:55:13,480 --> 01:55:15,480
What are you doing?

496
01:55:19,480 --> 01:55:22,480
The DLC, I think, for anything.

497
01:55:22,480 --> 01:55:24,480
It would just have to be nicer.

498
01:55:24,480 --> 01:55:27,480
I'm just going to sit back down to be honest with you.

499
01:55:29,480 --> 01:55:31,480
I kind of want to PB&J.

500
01:55:33,480 --> 01:55:36,480
Sir, Boomi, can you lay down?

501
01:55:37,480 --> 01:55:40,480
I can't see past your giant.

502
01:55:48,480 --> 01:55:51,480
He just laid on my go XR and muted me.

503
01:55:51,480 --> 01:55:53,480
Oh, thank you for the 10 gifted.

504
01:55:53,480 --> 01:55:55,480
I appreciate it.

505
01:55:55,480 --> 01:55:57,480
Thank you so much.

506
01:55:59,480 --> 01:56:02,480
Boomi just closed my game.

507
01:56:03,480 --> 01:56:07,480
And opened up Microsoft 365 for some reason.

508
01:56:11,480 --> 01:56:14,480
Everybody say thank you, Boomi.

509
01:56:14,480 --> 01:56:16,480
Stop.

510
01:56:16,480 --> 01:56:18,480
Oh, God.

511
01:56:18,480 --> 01:56:20,480
Let me sit back down again.

512
01:56:26,480 --> 01:56:28,480
Okay.

513
01:56:29,480 --> 01:56:34,480
I'm honestly debating if I should just run around.

514
01:56:34,480 --> 01:56:38,480
Do they scale with the...

515
01:56:41,480 --> 01:56:43,480
With the Scattertree?

516
01:56:45,480 --> 01:56:47,480
I thought you were dead.

517
01:56:48,480 --> 01:56:51,480
Do they scale with the Scattertree stuff?

518
01:56:51,480 --> 01:56:54,480
The bosses?

519
01:56:55,480 --> 01:56:57,480
They don't?

520
01:56:57,480 --> 01:57:01,480
Then I'm wondering if I should go and run around and collect more.

521
01:57:06,480 --> 01:57:08,480
I might do just that.

522
01:57:09,480 --> 01:57:11,480
Only new game cycles? Okay.

523
01:57:11,480 --> 01:57:15,480
Oh, you look like a very strong motherfucker.

524
01:57:16,480 --> 01:57:18,480
Oh.

525
01:57:24,480 --> 01:57:27,480
I kind of want your swords.

526
01:57:32,480 --> 01:57:34,480
Ow.

527
01:57:34,480 --> 01:57:36,480
Can I have your swords?

528
01:57:37,480 --> 01:57:39,480
No?

529
01:57:39,480 --> 01:57:41,480
That's rude.

530
01:57:42,480 --> 01:57:45,480
Which way, Western Man?

531
01:57:45,480 --> 01:57:48,480
Am I in the ruins of King's Landing?

532
01:57:48,480 --> 01:57:50,480
What is this?

533
01:57:52,480 --> 01:57:54,480
Oh.

534
01:57:54,480 --> 01:57:57,480
Not the Piss River.

535
01:57:57,480 --> 01:58:00,480
Were you trying to sneak up on me, brother?

536
01:58:00,480 --> 01:58:03,480
It's not very cash money of you.

537
01:58:09,480 --> 01:58:11,480
Then Beast Bones.

538
01:58:11,480 --> 01:58:13,480
Okay.

539
01:58:13,480 --> 01:58:15,480
Are we sitting on something?

540
01:58:15,480 --> 01:58:17,480
I don't know.

541
01:58:17,480 --> 01:58:19,480
I don't know.

542
01:58:19,480 --> 01:58:21,480
I don't know.

543
01:58:21,480 --> 01:58:23,480
I don't know.

544
01:58:23,480 --> 01:58:25,480
Okay.

545
01:58:26,480 --> 01:58:28,480
Okay.

546
01:58:30,480 --> 01:58:37,480
I need one Scattertree fragment so I can do them in one hit.

547
01:58:37,480 --> 01:58:40,480
Because that's annoying that I have to do two hits.

548
01:58:43,480 --> 01:58:46,480
Wait, that's where I came from.

549
01:58:56,480 --> 01:58:59,480
Yes, God, you're blessing, yeah.

550
01:59:10,480 --> 01:59:12,480
Oh, that was the first time I swore.

551
01:59:12,480 --> 01:59:14,480
I swore, I think.

552
01:59:14,480 --> 01:59:16,480
That's why it's saying, like, hell.

553
01:59:18,480 --> 01:59:20,480
Oh, here we go.

554
01:59:20,480 --> 01:59:22,480
Yep.

555
01:59:22,480 --> 01:59:24,480
I don't know.

556
01:59:26,480 --> 01:59:28,480
I know, I saw that too.

557
01:59:28,480 --> 01:59:32,480
I saw the scale with Faith, but I read that before I read the other message.

558
01:59:32,480 --> 01:59:34,480
Did we meet the boss here yet?

559
01:59:34,480 --> 01:59:36,480
No.

560
01:59:36,480 --> 01:59:38,480
I literally just got here.

561
01:59:44,480 --> 01:59:46,480
Ow.

562
01:59:46,480 --> 01:59:48,480
Actually, can you kill me because that was just annoying.

563
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:50,480
Actually, no.

564
01:59:51,480 --> 01:59:54,480
Let me grab them and then you can kill me.

565
02:00:08,480 --> 02:00:11,480
Yeah, dominate the boss, sure.

566
02:00:11,480 --> 02:00:17,480
I know already, is this the dancing lion thingy?

567
02:00:18,480 --> 02:00:22,480
I already know how trash I'm going to be with that.

568
02:00:22,480 --> 02:00:24,480
Excuse me.

569
02:00:26,480 --> 02:00:27,480
Reena?

570
02:00:27,480 --> 02:00:29,480
Oh, frick.

571
02:00:32,480 --> 02:00:34,480
Booby's head is in the way.

572
02:00:40,480 --> 02:00:43,480
Booby's head is in the way.

573
02:00:44,480 --> 02:00:49,480
Oh, now he's laying down on my go XLR, so now I can see.

574
02:00:54,480 --> 02:00:58,480
He, like, ran off trying to get away from him because I couldn't see.

575
02:01:04,480 --> 02:01:07,480
I think this is running simulator.

576
02:01:07,480 --> 02:01:09,480
Oh, wow.

577
02:01:09,480 --> 02:01:11,480
Strange.

578
02:01:14,480 --> 02:01:16,480
Damn.

579
02:01:16,480 --> 02:01:19,480
I need to work on my freaking poise if this is what happens.

580
02:01:19,480 --> 02:01:21,480
What are those?

581
02:01:38,480 --> 02:01:42,480
Yeah, I beat everything first try.

582
02:01:42,480 --> 02:01:44,480
100%.

583
02:01:47,480 --> 02:01:50,480
Okay, I must have to go.

584
02:02:00,480 --> 02:02:02,480
Nothing.

585
02:02:02,480 --> 02:02:04,480
How did he follow me over here?

586
02:02:06,480 --> 02:02:08,480
Danny, good job.

587
02:02:08,480 --> 02:02:10,480
Okay.

588
02:02:13,480 --> 02:02:16,480
That just went right up my booty hole.

589
02:02:18,480 --> 02:02:21,480
Damn, that standing up animation took me forever.

590
02:02:28,480 --> 02:02:31,480
He's right behind me, isn't he?

591
02:02:43,480 --> 02:02:46,480
Who is that?

592
02:02:50,480 --> 02:02:52,480
Fire Knight.

593
02:02:54,480 --> 02:02:56,480
Where are you at, though?

594
02:03:05,480 --> 02:03:07,480
Oh, I missed some so did you.

595
02:03:12,480 --> 02:03:14,480
Okay.

596
02:03:26,480 --> 02:03:28,480
No, I didn't mean to do that.

597
02:03:28,480 --> 02:03:31,480
I meant to do the thrilling turn.

598
02:03:31,480 --> 02:03:33,480
Okay.

599
02:03:39,480 --> 02:03:41,480
Can we come over here?

600
02:03:43,480 --> 02:03:45,480
That's a cool blade.

601
02:03:47,480 --> 02:03:49,480
That's a cool name.

602
02:03:55,480 --> 02:03:57,480
That's a reach on it.

603
02:03:58,480 --> 02:04:00,480
Why are you named freaking Queen Lynn?

604
02:04:00,480 --> 02:04:03,480
You look like Prince freaking Charming.

605
02:04:06,480 --> 02:04:09,480
Really? I've actually never seen this NPC.

606
02:04:10,480 --> 02:04:12,480
I don't know about them.

607
02:04:12,480 --> 02:04:14,480
I might have just to run away from it.

608
02:04:14,480 --> 02:04:16,480
What?

609
02:04:16,480 --> 02:04:18,480
I don't know what just happened there.

610
02:04:18,480 --> 02:04:20,480
That was odd.

611
02:04:20,480 --> 02:04:22,480
I must have fallen and then I didn't see how.

612
02:04:26,480 --> 02:04:28,480
I might just ignore it.

613
02:04:28,480 --> 02:04:30,480
I don't know what just happened there.

614
02:04:30,480 --> 02:04:32,480
That was odd.

615
02:04:32,480 --> 02:04:34,480
I must have fallen and then I didn't see how.

616
02:04:34,480 --> 02:04:36,480
I might just ignore him

617
02:04:36,480 --> 02:04:38,480
and run around.

618
02:04:52,480 --> 02:04:54,480
Oh, he must be one of Mesmer's little girly pops.

619
02:04:54,480 --> 02:04:56,480
It's open.

620
02:05:00,480 --> 02:05:02,480
No, he's open.

621
02:05:02,480 --> 02:05:05,480
I'm assuming I have to do something about him.

622
02:05:09,480 --> 02:05:12,480
How do I get out of this area and progress?

623
02:05:12,480 --> 02:05:15,480
Do I have to beat him to progress?

624
02:05:22,480 --> 02:05:24,480
What just faces over here?

625
02:05:33,480 --> 02:05:38,480
I feel like I should be able to do some sort of parkour.

626
02:05:42,480 --> 02:05:44,480
What?

627
02:05:44,480 --> 02:05:46,480
Okay.

628
02:06:02,480 --> 02:06:04,480
Excuse me.

629
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:14,480
I have the high ground Anakin.

630
02:06:22,480 --> 02:06:24,480
Well, this doesn't lead anywhere.

631
02:06:32,480 --> 02:06:34,480
Okay.

632
02:06:38,480 --> 02:06:40,480
Is there someone compared?

633
02:06:40,480 --> 02:06:42,480
Okay.

634
02:06:42,480 --> 02:06:44,480
Do I just kill him?

635
02:06:54,480 --> 02:06:56,480
Yeah, okay.

636
02:06:56,480 --> 02:06:58,480
But do I need to kill him to progress?

637
02:06:58,480 --> 02:07:00,480
That's my question.

638
02:07:02,480 --> 02:07:04,480
Okay.

639
02:07:08,480 --> 02:07:10,480
Okay, so where do...

640
02:07:10,480 --> 02:07:12,480
I don't know where to go from here.

641
02:07:12,480 --> 02:07:14,480
The poopy water is where I need to go.

642
02:07:14,480 --> 02:07:16,480
Huh.

643
02:07:24,480 --> 02:07:26,480
I'll ignore him for now then.

644
02:07:32,480 --> 02:07:34,480
Oh, I keep almost falling off.

645
02:07:34,480 --> 02:07:36,480
How did he...

646
02:07:36,480 --> 02:07:38,480
Oh, oh my.

647
02:07:38,480 --> 02:07:42,480
I didn't think he would follow me all the way over there.

648
02:07:50,480 --> 02:07:54,480
I'm kind of confused.

649
02:07:54,480 --> 02:07:58,480
Is there... there must be a thing to the side of the mess?

650
02:08:02,480 --> 02:08:04,480
Okay.

651
02:08:06,480 --> 02:08:08,480
His weapon is pretty cool.

652
02:08:08,480 --> 02:08:10,480
It has really cool reach.

653
02:08:24,480 --> 02:08:26,480
Because I don't... I can't go through here.

654
02:08:28,480 --> 02:08:30,480
I keep getting stuck.

655
02:08:30,480 --> 02:08:32,480
These guys trap you.

656
02:08:32,480 --> 02:08:34,480
Like there's...

657
02:08:34,480 --> 02:08:36,480
You can't do anything.

658
02:08:38,480 --> 02:08:40,480
No, I don't need to know, but thank you.

659
02:08:54,480 --> 02:08:56,480
Okay, he just told me anyways, but thanks.

660
02:09:00,480 --> 02:09:02,480
Okay.

661
02:09:14,480 --> 02:09:16,480
Oh.

662
02:09:26,480 --> 02:09:28,480
He's gonna kill me.

663
02:09:28,480 --> 02:09:30,480
I didn't see the door the other way before.

664
02:09:33,480 --> 02:09:36,480
They're not even tough, they just are annoying at this point.

665
02:09:38,480 --> 02:09:40,480
I killed them in only a couple hits, so...

666
02:09:42,480 --> 02:09:44,480
I just need more vigor.

667
02:09:44,480 --> 02:09:46,480
I feel like vigor doesn't really mean a lot.

668
02:09:46,480 --> 02:09:50,480
I feel like if mine was across the screen, I still wouldn't even matter.

669
02:09:50,480 --> 02:09:52,480
It's already halfway there.

670
02:09:58,480 --> 02:10:00,480
I'm gonna go through.

671
02:10:08,480 --> 02:10:10,480
Don't you dare hit me down.

672
02:10:10,480 --> 02:10:12,480
Oh my god.

673
02:10:18,480 --> 02:10:20,480
He can... what?

674
02:10:20,480 --> 02:10:22,480
You can climb ladders?

675
02:10:28,480 --> 02:10:32,480
Since when? Since when?

676
02:10:32,480 --> 02:10:34,480
Since when I'm gonna fall off.

677
02:10:42,480 --> 02:10:44,480
Get out of the way.

678
02:10:46,480 --> 02:10:48,480
I didn't even mean to do that.

679
02:10:48,480 --> 02:10:50,480
Oh my god. Fuck off.

680
02:10:52,480 --> 02:10:54,480
Oh my god, actually.

681
02:10:54,480 --> 02:10:56,480
That's not fair.

682
02:10:56,480 --> 02:10:58,480
I don't like that at all.

683
02:10:58,480 --> 02:11:00,480
We shouldn't be able to climb.

684
02:11:06,480 --> 02:11:08,480
Alright, where are you then?

685
02:11:08,480 --> 02:11:10,480
Avastji.

686
02:11:18,480 --> 02:11:20,480
Okay, so this is the other side.

687
02:11:20,480 --> 02:11:22,480
Wow, throwing daggers is what I've always wanted.

688
02:11:24,480 --> 02:11:26,480
I feel like you can parkour.

689
02:11:36,480 --> 02:11:38,480
I hear roaring.

690
02:11:42,480 --> 02:11:46,480
Interesting. Well, obviously I've walked through there, so I'm not going to do that.

691
02:11:46,480 --> 02:11:48,480
I'll try to attempt to jump it.

692
02:11:54,480 --> 02:11:56,480
He was crying.

693
02:11:58,480 --> 02:12:00,480
Wait, I thought I could...

694
02:12:00,480 --> 02:12:02,480
From the angle, it looked like it was a thing I could walk on.

695
02:12:02,480 --> 02:12:04,480
How am I supposed to get over there?

696
02:12:08,480 --> 02:12:10,480
Okay, it's the other side then.

697
02:12:12,480 --> 02:12:14,480
You're not.

698
02:12:16,480 --> 02:12:18,480
What are you doing here?

699
02:12:24,480 --> 02:12:26,480
Oh, I didn't see you there.

700
02:12:42,480 --> 02:12:44,480
Very interesting.

701
02:12:44,480 --> 02:12:46,480
I don't see...

702
02:12:46,480 --> 02:12:48,480
I think something would be up in that little tower there, but there isn't.

703
02:12:48,480 --> 02:12:50,480
The color is standing funny.

704
02:12:54,480 --> 02:12:56,480
Oh my god, this is so huge.

705
02:12:56,480 --> 02:12:58,480
I'm like, quite overwhelmed.

706
02:12:58,480 --> 02:13:00,480
Just like how I was when I first played Elden Ring.

707
02:13:00,480 --> 02:13:02,480
It's a very unique feeling.

708
02:13:06,480 --> 02:13:08,480
Where are y'all coming from?

709
02:13:25,480 --> 02:13:28,480
This would be good to have a crowd control stone.

710
02:13:28,480 --> 02:13:30,480
Oh, what? I just totally missed.

711
02:13:30,480 --> 02:13:32,480
I mean crowd control, I didn't even spell.

712
02:13:44,480 --> 02:13:46,480
Scorpion liver?

713
02:13:46,480 --> 02:13:48,480
Sombra smithing stone.

714
02:13:54,480 --> 02:13:56,480
Are there more coming?

715
02:13:56,480 --> 02:13:58,480
What the hell is that noise?

716
02:14:06,480 --> 02:14:08,480
Oh, it's...

717
02:14:08,480 --> 02:14:10,480
What are those?

718
02:14:10,480 --> 02:14:12,480
Oh, it's like fly thingies.

719
02:14:14,480 --> 02:14:16,480
I'm going to keep moving this way for now.

720
02:14:16,480 --> 02:14:18,480
I'm moving this way for now.

721
02:14:22,480 --> 02:14:24,480
Although this looks like a freaking boss room for no reason.

722
02:14:24,480 --> 02:14:26,480
Something going to fall?

723
02:14:26,480 --> 02:14:28,480
Oh, yeah, there you are.

724
02:14:28,480 --> 02:14:30,480
Oh, there's one first.

725
02:14:34,480 --> 02:14:36,480
I think I'm out here.

726
02:14:38,480 --> 02:14:40,480
Come back.

727
02:14:46,480 --> 02:14:48,480
Come back.

728
02:14:58,480 --> 02:15:00,480
Oh, they really stagger you.

729
02:15:10,480 --> 02:15:12,480
Oh, there's more in the door.

730
02:15:12,480 --> 02:15:14,480
Yeah, the DLC is fun.

731
02:15:14,480 --> 02:15:16,480
Exploring stuff, I haven't really gone that far.

732
02:15:18,480 --> 02:15:20,480
I apologize for the lack of speaking.

733
02:15:22,480 --> 02:15:24,480
I'm very sleepy in my headache and stuff.

734
02:15:24,480 --> 02:15:26,480
So I'm just chilling.

735
02:15:32,480 --> 02:15:34,480
I think that cliff thing is there for a reason.

736
02:15:34,480 --> 02:15:36,480
So you can lift up and jump off of it.

737
02:15:44,480 --> 02:15:46,480
Okay.

738
02:15:54,480 --> 02:15:56,480
Bye-bye.

739
02:16:14,480 --> 02:16:16,480
Please kill the spawn.

740
02:16:16,480 --> 02:16:18,480
Kill them all.

741
02:16:18,480 --> 02:16:20,480
A scorpion vtuber would be very cool.

742
02:16:20,480 --> 02:16:22,480
More invertible.

743
02:16:22,480 --> 02:16:24,480
It's weird that scorpions are rocklings.

744
02:16:26,480 --> 02:16:28,480
So there's the first one.

745
02:16:28,480 --> 02:16:30,480
Oh, it's right there.

746
02:16:30,480 --> 02:16:32,480
There's another one right there.

747
02:16:32,480 --> 02:16:34,480
Why does that one look like it spits fire or something?

748
02:16:34,480 --> 02:16:36,480
Because it has like a red body versus a black body.

749
02:16:36,480 --> 02:16:38,480
Very interesting.

750
02:16:38,480 --> 02:16:40,480
There must be different types then.

751
02:16:40,480 --> 02:16:42,480
Yeah.

752
02:16:44,480 --> 02:16:46,480
Maybe it's gender dimorphism.

753
02:16:48,480 --> 02:16:50,480
It looks a lot different.

754
02:16:50,480 --> 02:16:52,480
It has like a skinnier body.

755
02:16:52,480 --> 02:16:54,480
Or maybe I'm looking at the wrong thing.

756
02:16:54,480 --> 02:16:56,480
No, it is definitely different.

757
02:16:56,480 --> 02:16:58,480
Interesting.

758
02:16:58,480 --> 02:17:00,480
Are you going to come attack me?

759
02:17:10,480 --> 02:17:12,480
I knew you were going to clip through the wall.

760
02:17:34,480 --> 02:17:36,480
Interesting.

761
02:17:36,480 --> 02:17:38,480
I wonder what this one does.

762
02:17:40,480 --> 02:17:42,480
Okay.

763
02:17:48,480 --> 02:17:50,480
You're a lot weaker.

764
02:17:50,480 --> 02:17:52,480
To my pants.

765
02:17:54,480 --> 02:17:56,480
I don't know what that status is.

766
02:17:56,480 --> 02:17:58,480
I can't tell if it's poison or not.

767
02:17:58,480 --> 02:18:00,480
Bonebow.

768
02:18:00,480 --> 02:18:02,480
Okay.

769
02:18:06,480 --> 02:18:08,480
Yeah, it looks like poison,

770
02:18:08,480 --> 02:18:10,480
but I can't remember because I haven't...

771
02:18:10,480 --> 02:18:12,480
Oh.

772
02:18:12,480 --> 02:18:14,480
These don't go anywhere.

773
02:18:16,480 --> 02:18:18,480
Oh, is there nothing in here

774
02:18:18,480 --> 02:18:20,480
just as ominous and scary?

775
02:18:20,480 --> 02:18:22,480
All right.

776
02:18:26,480 --> 02:18:28,480
Yeah, second try.

777
02:18:28,480 --> 02:18:30,480
Maybe...

778
02:18:30,480 --> 02:18:32,480
as if they're bosses.

779
02:18:34,480 --> 02:18:36,480
Is this lead somewhere? Is this where it came from?

780
02:18:38,480 --> 02:18:40,480
Yeah.

781
02:18:40,480 --> 02:18:42,480
I don't like the chittering of those

782
02:18:42,480 --> 02:18:44,480
fly things.

783
02:18:44,480 --> 02:18:46,480
Let's go this way.

784
02:18:46,480 --> 02:18:48,480
There's also the well I can always go to.

785
02:18:50,480 --> 02:18:52,480
The bird is just burdened.

786
02:18:54,480 --> 02:18:56,480
I'm so angry.

787
02:18:56,480 --> 02:18:58,480
I'm just hanging out.

788
02:18:58,480 --> 02:19:00,480
I'm also missing you.

789
02:19:00,480 --> 02:19:02,480
Am I just stunning you?

790
02:19:04,480 --> 02:19:06,480
It's not very natural,

791
02:19:06,480 --> 02:19:08,480
but that's fine.

792
02:19:14,480 --> 02:19:16,480
I am just too short.

793
02:19:16,480 --> 02:19:18,480
Imagine if you could lift yourself up in this game.

794
02:19:18,480 --> 02:19:20,480
That'd be crazy.

795
02:19:24,480 --> 02:19:26,480
Oh, I'm gonna be right here.

796
02:19:28,480 --> 02:19:30,480
Oh yeah, I forgot you under there.

797
02:19:30,480 --> 02:19:32,480
Oh.

798
02:19:34,480 --> 02:19:36,480
Dragonfly thing.

799
02:19:36,480 --> 02:19:38,480
So creepy looking.

800
02:19:38,480 --> 02:19:40,480
Oh, you can fly?

801
02:19:42,480 --> 02:19:44,480
Easter.

802
02:19:44,480 --> 02:19:46,480
I maxed out my thingy.

803
02:19:54,480 --> 02:19:56,480
Same, bro.

804
02:19:56,480 --> 02:19:58,480
Wow.

805
02:20:02,480 --> 02:20:04,480
Me when I do.

806
02:20:06,480 --> 02:20:08,480
Ew, look at the maggots.

807
02:20:08,480 --> 02:20:10,480
You see that? That's crazy.

808
02:20:10,480 --> 02:20:12,480
Very nice touch

809
02:20:12,480 --> 02:20:14,480
to change up the poison.

810
02:20:14,480 --> 02:20:16,480
Why am I not hitting right over here?

811
02:20:20,480 --> 02:20:22,480
What?

812
02:20:22,480 --> 02:20:24,480
Can I please back up?

813
02:20:27,480 --> 02:20:29,480
Oh my god, you're...

814
02:20:31,480 --> 02:20:33,480
I'm trying to heal.

815
02:20:36,480 --> 02:20:38,480
Can I...?

816
02:20:42,480 --> 02:20:45,480
It's like not looking down to the right person for some reason.

817
02:20:45,480 --> 02:20:47,480
There's been a lot of that today.

818
02:20:49,480 --> 02:20:52,480
Oh, okay, the poopoo water does not do anything to me.

819
02:20:52,480 --> 02:20:54,480
I couldn't tell if it was poison water or not,

820
02:20:54,480 --> 02:20:56,480
but I guess poison's a little bit...

821
02:20:58,480 --> 02:21:00,480
greener.

822
02:21:04,480 --> 02:21:06,480
Yeah, there seem like there are a lot of paths.

823
02:21:06,480 --> 02:21:08,480
Yeah, that's a...

824
02:21:08,480 --> 02:21:10,480
I'll be like, that was me.

825
02:21:14,480 --> 02:21:16,480
So me.

826
02:21:18,480 --> 02:21:20,480
This is the latest poop water.

827
02:21:24,480 --> 02:21:26,480
Okay, who's gonna try to grab me?

828
02:21:26,480 --> 02:21:28,480
There you are.

829
02:21:30,480 --> 02:21:32,480
What are you doing?

830
02:21:34,480 --> 02:21:36,480
You're aggroing the little thing, dude.

831
02:21:36,480 --> 02:21:38,480
I don't have to do that.

832
02:21:40,480 --> 02:21:42,480
Someone hit the pot, just because.

833
02:21:48,480 --> 02:21:50,480
Bro.

834
02:21:50,480 --> 02:21:52,480
Yeah, I peed quite easily.

835
02:21:55,480 --> 02:21:57,480
What does it mean I have a...

836
02:21:57,480 --> 02:21:59,480
I don't have much of a drag reflex though.

837
02:21:59,480 --> 02:22:01,480
It's one of those guys, baby.

838
02:22:01,480 --> 02:22:03,480
And my blue upside stream.

839
02:22:03,480 --> 02:22:05,480
I kind of want to do one of those sooner.

840
02:22:05,480 --> 02:22:08,480
Because I kind of just want to play who I pop.

841
02:22:10,480 --> 02:22:13,480
Oh, I didn't see how low my health was or what it healed.

842
02:22:13,480 --> 02:22:15,480
I'm very excited to get the other tools.

843
02:22:21,480 --> 02:22:23,480
All right.

844
02:22:23,480 --> 02:22:25,480
This is a lot of running.

845
02:22:27,480 --> 02:22:29,480
Not that I can't just run past everybody, but...

846
02:22:33,480 --> 02:22:35,480
Mm-hmm.

847
02:22:35,480 --> 02:22:37,480
Mm-hmm.

848
02:22:37,480 --> 02:22:40,480
We have to, like, try not getting hit.

849
02:22:40,480 --> 02:22:43,480
And then we have to try not getting hit on the ladder.

850
02:23:07,480 --> 02:23:09,480
I knew you were there.

851
02:23:09,480 --> 02:23:11,480
I didn't know you were going to do that to me, though.

852
02:23:17,480 --> 02:23:19,480
What?

853
02:23:19,480 --> 02:23:21,480
Pfft.

854
02:23:21,480 --> 02:23:23,480
What?

855
02:23:23,480 --> 02:23:25,480
Pfft.

856
02:23:25,480 --> 02:23:27,480
Pfft.

857
02:23:27,480 --> 02:23:29,480
Pfft.

858
02:23:29,480 --> 02:23:31,480
Pfft.

859
02:23:31,480 --> 02:23:33,480
Pfft.

860
02:23:33,480 --> 02:23:35,480
Pfft.

861
02:23:35,480 --> 02:23:37,480
Pfft.

862
02:23:37,480 --> 02:23:39,480
Pfft.

863
02:23:39,480 --> 02:23:41,480
It's okay.

864
02:23:41,480 --> 02:23:43,480
We're having a chill stream.

865
02:23:47,480 --> 02:23:49,480
I'm trying to use the white one.

866
02:23:49,480 --> 02:23:51,480
I don't know why it's like...

867
02:23:55,480 --> 02:23:57,480
No, bro.

868
02:23:57,480 --> 02:23:59,480
Hang on.

869
02:23:59,480 --> 02:24:01,480
I should have picked those up.

870
02:24:01,480 --> 02:24:03,480
Was it painted into my health again?

871
02:24:03,480 --> 02:24:05,480
I'm tired of running all this way.

872
02:24:11,480 --> 02:24:13,480
I'm going to take the fattest nap after this stream.

873
02:24:17,480 --> 02:24:19,480
I realize, like, I will sleep,

874
02:24:19,480 --> 02:24:21,480
but I won't sleep sleep.

875
02:24:21,480 --> 02:24:23,480
Like, I went to bed after I streamed,

876
02:24:23,480 --> 02:24:25,480
which was, what, like 12?

877
02:24:25,480 --> 02:24:27,480
And I woke up at, like, 8,

878
02:24:27,480 --> 02:24:29,480
and I still feel like I didn't sleep at all.

879
02:24:29,480 --> 02:24:31,480
Bumi is touching something on my keyboard,

880
02:24:31,480 --> 02:24:33,480
and it's kind of...

881
02:24:33,480 --> 02:24:35,480
messing me up.

882
02:24:35,480 --> 02:24:37,480
I don't know what he's on.

883
02:24:37,480 --> 02:24:39,480
It's okay.

884
02:24:39,480 --> 02:24:41,480
I just really scared him.

885
02:24:49,480 --> 02:24:51,480
There's just one keyboard.

886
02:25:01,480 --> 02:25:03,480
What?

887
02:25:05,480 --> 02:25:07,480
What?

888
02:25:09,480 --> 02:25:11,480
Why can't I climb?

889
02:25:19,480 --> 02:25:21,480
That was weird.

890
02:25:23,480 --> 02:25:25,480
Yeah.

891
02:25:25,480 --> 02:25:27,480
Well, I'm sleeping on the couch

892
02:25:27,480 --> 02:25:29,480
to be closer to her.

893
02:25:29,480 --> 02:25:31,480
I should have really just

894
02:25:31,480 --> 02:25:33,480
bring her to my bed with me.

895
02:25:39,480 --> 02:25:41,480
Where am I now?

896
02:25:41,480 --> 02:25:43,480
Hi.

897
02:25:43,480 --> 02:25:45,480
No.

898
02:25:45,480 --> 02:25:47,480
No, I wanted to go look at stuff

899
02:25:47,480 --> 02:25:49,480
and you ruined it.

900
02:25:51,480 --> 02:25:53,480
Dang, moving through this is annoying

901
02:25:53,480 --> 02:25:55,480
because I just die in a couple of hits.

902
02:26:03,480 --> 02:26:07,480
I need, like, a wrap around.

903
02:26:07,480 --> 02:26:09,480
There's just like, the grace is so far.

904
02:26:09,480 --> 02:26:11,480
It's really just running to get there

905
02:26:11,480 --> 02:26:13,480
that's annoying.

906
02:26:13,480 --> 02:26:15,480
Because I finally got there and then I die

907
02:26:15,480 --> 02:26:17,480
because I'm like, oh, what's this?

908
02:26:17,480 --> 02:26:19,480
Oh, what's over here?

909
02:26:19,480 --> 02:26:21,480
And then I die to something I don't know that's nearby.

910
02:26:21,480 --> 02:26:23,480
Like, this guy just took me to half.

911
02:26:23,480 --> 02:26:25,480
And I feel like he shouldn't be able to.

912
02:26:31,480 --> 02:26:33,480
Do you want to hit?

913
02:26:33,480 --> 02:26:35,480
No, I'm fine.

914
02:26:35,480 --> 02:26:37,480
I didn't have to heal, but whatever.

915
02:26:37,480 --> 02:26:39,480
Doesn't really matter.

916
02:26:39,480 --> 02:26:41,480
I'm probably going to die soon anyways.

917
02:26:51,480 --> 02:26:53,480
Are you serious?

918
02:27:13,480 --> 02:27:15,480
I'm not sure about that.

919
02:27:15,480 --> 02:27:17,480
I'm not a fan of that.

920
02:27:21,480 --> 02:27:23,480
They do.

921
02:27:23,480 --> 02:27:25,480
They really do.

922
02:27:29,480 --> 02:27:31,480
I just want to progress.

923
02:27:31,480 --> 02:27:33,480
That's all I want to do.

924
02:27:37,480 --> 02:27:39,480
Yeah, that's like, I am my poise.

925
02:27:39,480 --> 02:27:41,480
It's trash for some reason.

926
02:27:41,480 --> 02:27:43,480
I can't wait to get another armor set here.

927
02:27:43,480 --> 02:27:45,480
Oh, my God.

928
02:27:49,480 --> 02:27:51,480
Please climb the ladder.

929
02:27:51,480 --> 02:27:53,480
Oh, my God.

930
02:27:53,480 --> 02:27:55,480
I really should just kill that guy

931
02:27:55,480 --> 02:27:57,480
any time I run past him.

932
02:28:01,480 --> 02:28:03,480
Hopefully I don't get stun locked

933
02:28:03,480 --> 02:28:05,480
when I come off the ladder.

934
02:28:05,480 --> 02:28:07,480
That would be great.

935
02:28:07,480 --> 02:28:09,480
That would be lovely.

936
02:28:13,480 --> 02:28:15,480
Can I go up this side?

937
02:28:15,480 --> 02:28:17,480
I can.

938
02:28:21,480 --> 02:28:23,480
Can I?

939
02:28:23,480 --> 02:28:25,480
What is that?

940
02:28:37,480 --> 02:28:39,480
Run past your stupid ass.

941
02:28:43,480 --> 02:28:45,480
No.

942
02:28:45,480 --> 02:28:47,480
No.

943
02:28:47,480 --> 02:28:49,480
No.

944
02:28:49,480 --> 02:28:51,480
Where are you holding?

945
02:28:51,480 --> 02:28:53,480
I don't know what that is.

946
02:28:55,480 --> 02:28:57,480
I'm going to die.

947
02:28:57,480 --> 02:28:59,480
That's how it ends.

948
02:28:59,480 --> 02:29:01,480
With a black pyre fry in hand.

949
02:29:01,480 --> 02:29:03,480
No.

950
02:29:11,480 --> 02:29:13,480
I should have died to that.

951
02:29:13,480 --> 02:29:15,480
All right, stay down there, please.

952
02:29:19,480 --> 02:29:21,480
I got stuff to do.

953
02:29:21,480 --> 02:29:23,480
I got people to see.

954
02:29:25,480 --> 02:29:27,480
Okay, that's stupid.

955
02:29:31,480 --> 02:29:33,480
Stop.

956
02:29:41,480 --> 02:29:43,480
What?

957
02:29:47,480 --> 02:29:49,480
No.

958
02:29:53,480 --> 02:29:55,480
Ow.

959
02:29:57,480 --> 02:29:59,480
What?

960
02:30:01,480 --> 02:30:03,480
No.

961
02:30:05,480 --> 02:30:07,480
Oh, you motherfucker, bro.

962
02:30:07,480 --> 02:30:09,480
You motherfucker.

963
02:30:09,480 --> 02:30:11,480
Sorry, I'm trying to look around.

964
02:30:13,480 --> 02:30:15,480
Oh, they're the state of America.

965
02:30:15,480 --> 02:30:17,480
Thank fucking God.

966
02:30:17,480 --> 02:30:19,480
Jeez.

967
02:30:31,480 --> 02:30:33,480
Pot carrier.

968
02:30:33,480 --> 02:30:35,480
Oh, okay.

969
02:30:45,480 --> 02:30:47,480
The camera angle.

970
02:30:53,480 --> 02:30:55,480
Interesting.

971
02:30:55,480 --> 02:30:57,480
What is that?

972
02:30:57,480 --> 02:30:59,480
Okay.

973
02:30:59,480 --> 02:31:01,480
I don't have that good of poise, though.

974
02:31:05,480 --> 02:31:07,480
So I'm skeptical about playing soccer.

975
02:31:11,480 --> 02:31:13,480
I might go kill that pot carrier, then,

976
02:31:13,480 --> 02:31:15,480
or at least attempt to.

977
02:31:17,480 --> 02:31:19,480
Since the stake is right there.

978
02:31:25,480 --> 02:31:27,480
Okay.

979
02:31:45,480 --> 02:31:47,480
Oh, my God, please.

980
02:31:47,480 --> 02:31:49,480
What was that?

981
02:31:49,480 --> 02:31:51,480
What?

982
02:31:53,480 --> 02:31:57,480
I'm like, please, please just let me, please just let me pick it up.

983
02:32:01,480 --> 02:32:03,480
I didn't know if Sifu was a challenging game.

984
02:32:03,480 --> 02:32:05,480
Not that I played it.

985
02:32:05,480 --> 02:32:07,480
I've seen it before, but I never...

986
02:32:09,480 --> 02:32:11,480
What? I can't go to the stake.

987
02:32:11,480 --> 02:32:13,480
Did I accidentally do whatever?

988
02:32:13,480 --> 02:32:15,480
I couldn't be near the stake America?

989
02:32:15,480 --> 02:32:17,480
That's dumb.

990
02:32:19,480 --> 02:32:23,480
Let's just do this fucking shit again.

991
02:32:29,480 --> 02:32:31,480
You can just hit me on the way up.

992
02:32:31,480 --> 02:32:33,480
You dare knock me off?

993
02:32:33,480 --> 02:32:35,480
I swear to God.

994
02:32:35,480 --> 02:32:37,480
That too far? Yeah.

995
02:32:49,480 --> 02:32:51,480
At least I know I can come over here

996
02:32:51,480 --> 02:32:53,480
and I can hop up the other way.

997
02:32:55,480 --> 02:32:57,480
Why are you so on me?

998
02:32:59,480 --> 02:33:01,480
To avoid this one here.

999
02:33:09,480 --> 02:33:13,480
You think you could fly up here, but you can't.

1000
02:33:13,480 --> 02:33:15,480
You're stupid.

1001
02:33:19,480 --> 02:33:21,480
It's not letting me do my actual war.

1002
02:33:21,480 --> 02:33:23,480
I don't...

1003
02:33:23,480 --> 02:33:25,480
I'm so weird.

1004
02:33:25,480 --> 02:33:27,480
What?

1005
02:33:27,480 --> 02:33:29,480
Where the...

1006
02:33:31,480 --> 02:33:33,480
What did he come from?

1007
02:33:35,480 --> 02:33:39,480
I sound like Icy for a second today.

1008
02:33:39,480 --> 02:33:41,480
You'll think I sound like Icy.

1009
02:33:49,480 --> 02:33:53,480
I don't know where he came from, genuinely.

1010
02:33:57,480 --> 02:34:01,480
Around each corner there is a dude.

1011
02:34:01,480 --> 02:34:03,480
Just a dude.

1012
02:34:05,480 --> 02:34:07,480
Oh no, I shouldn't have attacked him.

1013
02:34:09,480 --> 02:34:11,480
No.

1014
02:34:11,480 --> 02:34:13,480
I will not allow it.

1015
02:34:19,480 --> 02:34:23,480
Did he climb that and then follow me all the way over here?

1016
02:34:23,480 --> 02:34:25,480
I just want to know.

1017
02:34:27,480 --> 02:34:29,480
Why did...

1018
02:34:29,480 --> 02:34:31,480
Was I auto walking on?

1019
02:34:33,480 --> 02:34:37,480
I don't like how human their noises are.

1020
02:34:43,480 --> 02:34:45,480
Haha.

1021
02:34:45,480 --> 02:34:47,480
He's already up there.

1022
02:34:47,480 --> 02:34:51,480
I didn't... Is there... Oh yeah, he's over that side. That's what it was.

1023
02:35:03,480 --> 02:35:05,480
I like the song in this area.

1024
02:35:05,480 --> 02:35:07,480
It's very cool.

1025
02:35:17,480 --> 02:35:21,480
He's right behind me, isn't he?

1026
02:35:21,480 --> 02:35:23,480
What is that?

1027
02:35:23,480 --> 02:35:27,480
I didn't even get to see what it was, but it reminded me of Malky.

1028
02:35:33,480 --> 02:35:35,480
What is that? I can't even tell.

1029
02:35:41,480 --> 02:35:43,480
What are you?

1030
02:35:47,480 --> 02:35:51,480
Oh, you have the same moveset as the fucking dragon.

1031
02:35:53,480 --> 02:35:55,480
Alright, lion. It looks like it.

1032
02:35:59,480 --> 02:36:01,480
Ooh, cool looking.

1033
02:36:09,480 --> 02:36:13,480
I feel like I would have done the wrong side of grace, so I'm sorry.

1034
02:36:13,480 --> 02:36:15,480
I don't know why.

1035
02:36:15,480 --> 02:36:19,480
He is a quicky little boy.

1036
02:36:19,480 --> 02:36:21,480
Let's see.

1037
02:36:39,480 --> 02:36:41,480
He doesn't do too much damage.

1038
02:36:45,480 --> 02:36:47,480
I don't know.

1039
02:37:05,480 --> 02:37:07,480
I can summon Freo.

1040
02:37:09,480 --> 02:37:11,480
Let's go say hello.

1041
02:37:15,480 --> 02:37:17,480
Wreck the Boss? That's not happening.

1042
02:37:35,480 --> 02:37:37,480
Who's talking?

1043
02:37:41,480 --> 02:37:43,480
What?

1044
02:37:45,480 --> 02:37:47,480
It's a big bag of food.

1045
02:37:47,480 --> 02:37:49,480
Rice.

1046
02:37:49,480 --> 02:37:51,480
So this is dead body, just chilling here.

1047
02:37:51,480 --> 02:37:53,480
Then I just resurrected it.

1048
02:37:53,480 --> 02:37:55,480
Grandma?

1049
02:37:55,480 --> 02:37:57,480
Who's grandma?

1050
02:38:01,480 --> 02:38:03,480
Is that the lady who talked?

1051
02:38:03,480 --> 02:38:05,480
I don't know.

1052
02:38:07,480 --> 02:38:09,480
Yes, I know.

1053
02:38:09,480 --> 02:38:11,480
Like, I can't remember.

1054
02:38:15,480 --> 02:38:17,480
That's a foot.

1055
02:38:19,480 --> 02:38:21,480
That's so cool.

1056
02:38:25,480 --> 02:38:27,480
I never knew that it was like...

1057
02:38:31,480 --> 02:38:33,480
It has human body parts under there.

1058
02:38:33,480 --> 02:38:43,480
I thought it was like an actual giant lion, but it's very heavily inspired by an actual dancing lion.

1059
02:38:43,480 --> 02:38:45,480
That's so cool.

1060
02:38:45,480 --> 02:38:47,480
Divine Beast.

1061
02:38:47,480 --> 02:38:49,480
What is this song?

1062
02:38:49,480 --> 02:38:51,480
Beast Face.

1063
02:38:59,480 --> 02:39:01,480
What kind of music do you hear?

1064
02:39:01,480 --> 02:39:03,480
I don't know.

1065
02:39:03,480 --> 02:39:05,480
Okay.

1066
02:39:13,480 --> 02:39:15,480
Oh, yes.

1067
02:39:15,480 --> 02:39:17,480
It's very hard to see.

1068
02:39:17,480 --> 02:39:19,480
It does so much.

1069
02:39:21,480 --> 02:39:23,480
It's very hard to read its patterns.

1070
02:39:27,480 --> 02:39:29,480
It's smart that they put the grace right next to the door.

1071
02:39:43,480 --> 02:39:47,480
This could be a Bloodstone Blade sort of thing.

1072
02:39:47,480 --> 02:39:51,480
So this thing will kill me in two hits, that's for sure.

1073
02:39:51,480 --> 02:39:53,480
Yeah.

1074
02:39:55,480 --> 02:39:59,480
Because of the Dodge AI, I would probably want to do the Bloodblade, I mean.

1075
02:40:01,480 --> 02:40:03,480
Yeah, the theme is really cool.

1076
02:40:09,480 --> 02:40:11,480
I know who Wukong is, but I don't know what you mean.

1077
02:40:11,480 --> 02:40:13,480
What's that from?

1078
02:40:15,480 --> 02:40:17,480
I might call it England.

1079
02:40:17,480 --> 02:40:19,480
Oh, true, because it's invisible.

1080
02:40:21,480 --> 02:40:23,480
Let's see, let's see.

1081
02:40:23,480 --> 02:40:25,480
Let's see two little ashes.

1082
02:40:41,480 --> 02:40:43,480
Is that worth your time?

1083
02:40:51,480 --> 02:40:53,480
I guess I pressed it too slow.

1084
02:40:53,480 --> 02:40:57,480
I don't know if it hitboxed those because I thought it was pretty far away.

1085
02:41:03,480 --> 02:41:05,480
Oh, it's a game.

1086
02:41:05,480 --> 02:41:07,480
Oh, interesting.

1087
02:41:07,480 --> 02:41:09,480
The column block meant interesting.

1088
02:41:09,480 --> 02:41:11,480
I didn't haven't heard about that.

1089
02:41:33,480 --> 02:41:35,480
What?

1090
02:41:35,480 --> 02:41:37,480
That thing pulled me and almost got me in one hit.

1091
02:41:39,480 --> 02:41:41,480
Yeah.

1092
02:41:53,480 --> 02:41:55,480
Really beautiful music.

1093
02:41:55,480 --> 02:42:13,480
It's so hard to read this, and I wonder why it's one of the hardest bosses.

1094
02:42:13,480 --> 02:42:15,480
Yeah.

1095
02:42:19,480 --> 02:42:29,480
I would need skill to kill this one, which I do not have.

1096
02:42:43,480 --> 02:42:45,480
Can I?

1097
02:42:45,480 --> 02:42:47,480
My poise is so bad.

1098
02:42:47,480 --> 02:42:49,480
I don't...

1099
02:42:49,480 --> 02:42:51,480
I just keep getting stomached.

1100
02:42:51,480 --> 02:42:53,480
I don't understand.

1101
02:42:53,480 --> 02:42:55,480
Why do I...

1102
02:42:55,480 --> 02:42:57,480
I just...

1103
02:42:57,480 --> 02:42:59,480
I just...

1104
02:42:59,480 --> 02:43:01,480
Yeah, it kills me in two hits.

1105
02:43:01,480 --> 02:43:03,480
And I'm not...

1106
02:43:03,480 --> 02:43:07,480
That would mean I would have to avoid getting hit.

1107
02:43:07,480 --> 02:43:11,480
And I don't know enough of a boss to do that.

1108
02:43:13,480 --> 02:43:15,480
It's happening out of the fucking way.

1109
02:43:15,480 --> 02:43:17,480
I don't like that it opened with that one.

1110
02:43:25,480 --> 02:43:29,480
I'm so confused because it looks like it hits me when it...

1111
02:43:29,480 --> 02:43:31,480
I don't react to it sometimes.

1112
02:43:31,480 --> 02:43:35,480
My character doesn't respond, and I don't notice.

1113
02:43:35,480 --> 02:43:45,480
Yeah, I need to get better armor.

1114
02:43:45,480 --> 02:43:47,480
If you have any recommendations, let me know.

1115
02:43:47,480 --> 02:43:49,480
Just tell me where to get it.

1116
02:43:49,480 --> 02:43:51,480
Don't tell me what it is.

1117
02:43:59,480 --> 02:44:03,480
Can you aggro the mimic tier, please?

1118
02:44:03,480 --> 02:44:05,480
I don't...

1119
02:44:07,480 --> 02:44:09,480
Oh, my God.

1120
02:44:15,480 --> 02:44:19,480
I want to take a picture, but I would get my phone and it would wake him up because he's very adorable.

1121
02:44:25,480 --> 02:44:29,480
Yeah, the boss is not even acknowledging the mimic.

1122
02:44:29,480 --> 02:44:31,480
Why do you...

1123
02:44:31,480 --> 02:44:35,480
I don't like it when you open with this hit because then you somehow clean it and pick it up.

1124
02:44:39,480 --> 02:44:43,480
And I also can't tell the timing because I can't tell when it hits me or not.

1125
02:44:47,480 --> 02:44:51,480
I never react to that front hit for some reason.

1126
02:44:59,480 --> 02:45:03,480
Can you get a lead on this?

1127
02:45:09,480 --> 02:45:11,480
I need backup.

1128
02:45:25,480 --> 02:45:27,480
Oh, what is this?

1129
02:45:29,480 --> 02:45:33,480
Oh, now you have lightning? That's just not fair.

1130
02:45:59,480 --> 02:46:05,480
I can't quite tell what's happening.

1131
02:46:05,480 --> 02:46:07,480
Oh, but...

1132
02:46:19,480 --> 02:46:21,480
I can't understand what's happening.

1133
02:46:29,480 --> 02:46:35,480
Oh, wow.

1134
02:46:35,480 --> 02:46:39,480
I didn't think I would get that for.

1135
02:46:39,480 --> 02:46:41,480
Okay, alright.

1136
02:46:43,480 --> 02:46:47,480
I didn't notice that I could repost him. I didn't hear it.

1137
02:46:47,480 --> 02:46:51,480
I only realized after the fact that he was stunned.

1138
02:46:59,480 --> 02:47:03,480
I only realized after the fact that he was stunned.

1139
02:47:03,480 --> 02:47:07,480
Okay, I might have this.

1140
02:47:07,480 --> 02:47:11,480
He's not as scary as I thought.

1141
02:47:11,480 --> 02:47:15,480
Okay, he didn't open with that one.

1142
02:47:29,480 --> 02:47:39,480
I need to get that lead up. Oh, shit. I didn't even know that I died already.

1143
02:47:39,480 --> 02:47:45,480
Again, it's hard to tell when I'm hit because the character doesn't audibly react.

1144
02:47:45,480 --> 02:47:51,480
It's very hard to see the...

1145
02:47:51,480 --> 02:47:55,480
You know how sometimes a hit animation is there?

1146
02:47:55,480 --> 02:47:59,480
Unless I'm staggered, it's hard to tell.

1147
02:48:11,480 --> 02:48:15,480
That's fine. I'm just stuck in the corner. Don't worry about it.

1148
02:48:15,480 --> 02:48:21,480
It's just a bunch of dudes. Just a bunch of dudes under there.

1149
02:48:21,480 --> 02:48:25,480
I could take on a bunch of dudes.

1150
02:48:25,480 --> 02:48:31,480
Don't you? That sounds terrible, actually. Oh my god, Jesus Christ.

1151
02:48:35,480 --> 02:48:39,480
No, I like this boss. The boss is very cool.

1152
02:48:45,480 --> 02:48:49,480
Okay.

1153
02:48:57,480 --> 02:49:05,480
Why? I'm genuinely surprised that it's not aggroing the Mimic tier.

1154
02:49:05,480 --> 02:49:15,480
The grandma breath attack. I think you just have to jump into it.

1155
02:49:15,480 --> 02:49:19,480
Oh, just be like that. It seems like it. I thought I could roll over it,

1156
02:49:19,480 --> 02:49:23,480
but it seems it's better just to jump over it.

1157
02:49:35,480 --> 02:49:39,480
Okay.

1158
02:49:47,480 --> 02:49:51,480
He's just very into me.

1159
02:49:51,480 --> 02:50:07,480
I'm not even making sure I go over it, because I'm just making sure he's aggroed on him.

1160
02:50:21,480 --> 02:50:29,480
No, he's gonna be over me.

1161
02:50:35,480 --> 02:50:39,480
Oh, because in the second phase, it was easier because he was aggroed on the Mimic,

1162
02:50:39,480 --> 02:50:47,480
and that's why he didn't pay attention to me as much. That's why I was closer. Bye. Have a good one.

1163
02:50:47,480 --> 02:50:53,480
Two horns in the trench coat. That's funny.

1164
02:50:53,480 --> 02:50:57,480
Oh my god, Bumi is so cute. Oh my god, I gotta pet him.

1165
02:50:57,480 --> 02:51:03,480
Handsome boy, why are you so adorable? Oh, you're stretching your little toes.

1166
02:51:03,480 --> 02:51:11,480
Oh, baby boy. Bumi, why are you so precious right now?

1167
02:51:17,480 --> 02:51:23,480
Hey, how about that one?

1168
02:51:47,480 --> 02:52:03,480
I'm stuck in him. What is happening?

1169
02:52:03,480 --> 02:52:11,480
That was weird.

1170
02:52:11,480 --> 02:52:17,480
What?

1171
02:52:25,480 --> 02:52:35,480
Why am I not doing my actual goal?

1172
02:52:35,480 --> 02:52:47,480
Oh my god.

1173
02:52:47,480 --> 02:53:07,480
Why are you searching so long?

1174
02:53:07,480 --> 02:53:15,480
Holy shit.

1175
02:53:17,480 --> 02:53:25,480
What the hell? How did it only take me like five tries?

1176
02:53:25,480 --> 02:53:37,480
That's so crazy. Thank you, Mimic tier.

1177
02:53:37,480 --> 02:53:45,480
I thought this was going to take me hours.

1178
02:53:45,480 --> 02:53:51,480
You guys are lying. Shut up.

1179
02:53:51,480 --> 02:53:59,480
What the hell? How did I... guys, what?

1180
02:53:59,480 --> 02:54:11,480
Oh my god, that's fun.

1181
02:54:11,480 --> 02:54:15,480
This is the first boss. He's not bad in comparison to the rest.

1182
02:54:15,480 --> 02:54:21,480
Someone's like, he's not that bad. Don't worry about it. Don't let it get to your head.

1183
02:54:21,480 --> 02:54:27,480
Okay, actually, I don't really need anything there.

1184
02:54:27,480 --> 02:54:37,480
That's the...

1185
02:54:37,480 --> 02:54:45,480
Makes my focus zero.

1186
02:54:45,480 --> 02:54:55,480
I can't see anything past this. What?

1187
02:54:55,480 --> 02:55:05,480
This is so huge.

1188
02:55:05,480 --> 02:55:11,480
I could go get Lionel's set.

1189
02:55:11,480 --> 02:55:23,480
Just to kill feet? No, wait.

1190
02:55:23,480 --> 02:55:29,480
I forgot I already have it.

1191
02:55:29,480 --> 02:55:37,480
But then I have a heavy load.

1192
02:55:37,480 --> 02:55:41,480
I feel like a regular hat.

1193
02:55:41,480 --> 02:56:01,480
But then my poise goes to 61.

1194
02:56:01,480 --> 02:56:11,480
That's so bad.

1195
02:56:11,480 --> 02:56:21,480
They call me Mr. Bombastic. Very fantastic.

1196
02:56:21,480 --> 02:56:27,480
I like them big.

1197
02:56:27,480 --> 02:56:37,480
Hold on, I have to move my cat because he's in the water and I can't give you the hot girl wrench.

1198
02:56:37,480 --> 02:56:47,480
How are you doing, Ms. Mom?

1199
02:56:47,480 --> 02:56:53,480
I got a bunch of buttons on my keyboard.

1200
02:56:53,480 --> 02:56:57,480
I am Mr. Bombastic right now.

1201
02:56:57,480 --> 02:57:07,480
I am the Elden Mord.

1202
02:57:07,480 --> 02:57:17,480
Take a pic, it's me.

1203
02:57:17,480 --> 02:57:27,480
Biggie cheese.

1204
02:57:27,480 --> 02:57:31,480
Okay, so now what do I do?

1205
02:57:31,480 --> 02:57:37,480
Guys, I thought that was going to take me a lot longer.

1206
02:57:37,480 --> 02:57:41,480
Is there a way to go straight out of there?

1207
02:57:41,480 --> 02:57:47,480
No, there's no doors.

1208
02:57:47,480 --> 02:57:55,480
Don't worry, I'm smart.

1209
02:57:55,480 --> 02:58:03,480
Biggie Biggs, they call me Shibby Shibs.

1210
02:58:03,480 --> 02:58:11,480
Mr. Lava Lava.

1211
02:58:11,480 --> 02:58:15,480
Hi, Boomi.

1212
02:58:15,480 --> 02:58:19,480
Time to get trolled by the game.

1213
02:58:19,480 --> 02:58:23,480
And we're back at the beginning.

1214
02:58:23,480 --> 02:58:29,480
Wait, where am I?

1215
02:58:29,480 --> 02:58:37,480
I'm doing what physics said, go back to the beginning.

1216
02:58:37,480 --> 02:58:39,480
Am I going to get hit by a ball?

1217
02:58:39,480 --> 02:58:47,480
Something is going to happen over here, I just know it.

1218
02:58:47,480 --> 02:58:51,480
Dry leaf? No, but I found fly leaf.

1219
02:58:51,480 --> 02:58:55,480
I can feel you all around me.

1220
02:58:55,480 --> 02:58:59,480
Think I need the air high breathing.

1221
02:58:59,480 --> 02:59:07,480
Sorry, hold on, I need to put on my...

1222
02:59:07,480 --> 02:59:11,480
Oh tower of ours hidden in shadow.

1223
02:59:11,480 --> 02:59:15,480
Oh lofty spiral piercing the heavens.

1224
02:59:15,480 --> 02:59:19,480
Lead him safely onto greater godhood.

1225
02:59:19,480 --> 02:59:25,480
And in divinity grant our salvation.

1226
02:59:25,480 --> 02:59:33,480
I'm probably going to use that effect during the ASMR tomorrow.

1227
02:59:33,480 --> 02:59:36,480
Actually, no, I wouldn't be able to.

1228
02:59:36,480 --> 02:59:40,480
Actually, no, I could put reverb and echo on my...

1229
02:59:40,480 --> 02:59:46,480
I'll just have to use plug-in for that instead of my mixer.

1230
02:59:46,480 --> 02:59:52,480
Because it'll be the tower of shadow message.

1231
02:59:52,480 --> 02:59:58,480
It'll be excuse me, lemme in.

1232
02:59:58,480 --> 03:00:04,480
Since it's a non-one and it's a non-role play, I'm going to be in a chapel.

1233
03:00:04,480 --> 03:00:08,480
Sealing obscured by shadow.

1234
03:00:08,480 --> 03:00:12,480
Well, I'm killing myself.

1235
03:00:12,480 --> 03:00:20,480
Wise men should fear three things.

1236
03:00:20,480 --> 03:00:24,480
A sea at storm, a night with twin moons.

1237
03:00:24,480 --> 03:00:28,480
And the anger of a gentle bunny.

1238
03:00:28,480 --> 03:00:36,480
I thought it was a night with no stars.

1239
03:00:36,480 --> 03:00:40,480
Anger of a gentle man.

1240
03:00:40,480 --> 03:00:46,480
Doors of stone, please, I'm begging you, Patrick Roffus.

1241
03:00:46,480 --> 03:00:48,480
You know what I'm going to use my platform for?

1242
03:00:48,480 --> 03:00:54,480
I'm going to use it to beg Patrick Roffus, me, a bunny girl,

1243
03:00:54,480 --> 03:01:02,480
Dominatrix bunny girl, to beg Patrick Roffus to release Doors of Stone.

1244
03:01:02,480 --> 03:01:06,480
In the game, right?

1245
03:01:06,480 --> 03:01:10,480
Yeah, never underestimate a rabbit.

1246
03:01:10,480 --> 03:01:14,480
It's pointing out of something that way.

1247
03:01:14,480 --> 03:01:20,480
I feel like there should be a door over here. Why would they have stairs?

1248
03:01:20,480 --> 03:01:24,480
Stupid. Let me out.

1249
03:01:24,480 --> 03:01:28,480
All right.

1250
03:01:28,480 --> 03:01:32,480
I could go to the well, so I'll do that.

1251
03:01:32,480 --> 03:01:38,480
Didn't mean to press that. Hold on.

1252
03:01:38,480 --> 03:01:46,480
My hint is the funny emote.

1253
03:01:46,480 --> 03:01:52,480
Because I didn't go over here.

1254
03:01:52,480 --> 03:02:00,480
I guess I'll go over here.

1255
03:02:00,480 --> 03:02:12,480
I need a key for the well. I have a storehouse key.

1256
03:02:12,480 --> 03:02:16,480
I'm examining. I'm examining using X.

1257
03:02:16,480 --> 03:02:18,480
Okay, it's square.

1258
03:02:18,480 --> 03:02:20,480
Message left by needle knight Leda.

1259
03:02:20,480 --> 03:02:22,480
Address the kindred spirit to pursue Mykola's trail.

1260
03:02:22,480 --> 03:02:26,480
They gated divinity lies in a tower sealed by shadow.

1261
03:02:26,480 --> 03:02:28,480
That is surely where the kind Mykola is headed.

1262
03:02:28,480 --> 03:02:30,480
We are no imperians.

1263
03:02:30,480 --> 03:02:32,480
We must locate the path that will lead us there.

1264
03:02:32,480 --> 03:02:34,480
I will follow the crosses east.

1265
03:02:34,480 --> 03:02:38,480
Okay.

1266
03:02:38,480 --> 03:02:54,480
There's a lot of castles to go through, which is interesting.

1267
03:02:54,480 --> 03:02:56,480
Where's the well?

1268
03:02:56,480 --> 03:03:02,480
Well, well, well.

1269
03:03:02,480 --> 03:03:04,480
It's over here, right?

1270
03:03:04,480 --> 03:03:16,480
Yeah.

1271
03:03:16,480 --> 03:03:18,480
Later, bitch.

1272
03:03:18,480 --> 03:03:22,480
Boomi.

1273
03:03:22,480 --> 03:03:28,480
He's just curling up all cutely on my mousepad.

1274
03:03:28,480 --> 03:03:32,480
I have two.

1275
03:03:32,480 --> 03:03:34,480
That's the key to grandma.

1276
03:03:34,480 --> 03:03:38,480
Okay, we'll figure it out.

1277
03:03:38,480 --> 03:03:40,480
What we know.

1278
03:03:40,480 --> 03:03:42,480
So these are you right there and you guys right there.

1279
03:03:42,480 --> 03:03:46,480
I'm going to go after you first.

1280
03:03:46,480 --> 03:03:48,480
I'm assuming this is the...

1281
03:03:48,480 --> 03:03:50,480
Okay, yeah.

1282
03:03:50,480 --> 03:03:58,480
So I can't go down this way, but I'll grab what's down here at least.

1283
03:03:58,480 --> 03:04:00,480
Mesma fire.

1284
03:04:00,480 --> 03:04:02,480
Can I...

1285
03:04:02,480 --> 03:04:14,480
Can I please climb?

1286
03:04:14,480 --> 03:04:16,480
My outfit is on peak.

1287
03:04:16,480 --> 03:04:24,480
I am actually getting it.

1288
03:04:24,480 --> 03:04:28,480
Where?

1289
03:04:28,480 --> 03:04:30,480
I did. Thank you.

1290
03:04:30,480 --> 03:04:32,480
Excuse me.

1291
03:04:32,480 --> 03:04:34,480
Just got to go this way.

1292
03:04:34,480 --> 03:04:36,480
Is there another...

1293
03:04:36,480 --> 03:04:46,480
I feel like there's another avenue that I have not gone.

1294
03:04:46,480 --> 03:04:54,480
Like I never went down the stairs.

1295
03:04:54,480 --> 03:04:58,480
This is where I came up from.

1296
03:04:58,480 --> 03:05:02,480
But I never went down the stairs near the bug.

1297
03:05:02,480 --> 03:05:06,480
Can't kill the prince charming.

1298
03:05:06,480 --> 03:05:10,480
Oh, thank you for stopping by.

1299
03:05:10,480 --> 03:05:12,480
Where's grandma?

1300
03:05:12,480 --> 03:05:14,480
What is grandma that you speak of?

1301
03:05:14,480 --> 03:05:16,480
Whoa, bro.

1302
03:05:16,480 --> 03:05:18,480
Oh.

1303
03:05:18,480 --> 03:05:22,480
Freaking chucked me.

1304
03:05:22,480 --> 03:05:34,480
Grandma is left to the second grace.

1305
03:05:34,480 --> 03:05:56,480
Hold on.

1306
03:05:56,480 --> 03:05:58,480
I need to pause and think.

1307
03:05:58,480 --> 03:06:00,480
Did I go down there?

1308
03:06:00,480 --> 03:06:08,480
I think I did.

1309
03:06:08,480 --> 03:06:10,480
Oh, that's where this dude is.

1310
03:06:10,480 --> 03:06:16,480
Oh, he will give more runes if I kill him.

1311
03:06:16,480 --> 03:06:18,480
Maybe I shall.

1312
03:06:18,480 --> 03:06:22,480
Or maybe I shan't.

1313
03:06:22,480 --> 03:06:28,480
He's right behind me, isn't he?

1314
03:06:28,480 --> 03:06:36,480
Later, later, alligator.

1315
03:06:36,480 --> 03:06:40,480
See you soon, you masturbator.

1316
03:06:40,480 --> 03:06:44,480
What?

1317
03:06:44,480 --> 03:06:48,480
Climb, you fools.

1318
03:06:48,480 --> 03:06:54,480
Wait, I should probably level up the...

1319
03:06:54,480 --> 03:07:04,480
Who's aggroed on me?

1320
03:07:04,480 --> 03:07:12,480
Really? Okay.

1321
03:07:12,480 --> 03:07:34,480
I got my head just...

1322
03:07:34,480 --> 03:07:36,480
I'm sick, sick, sick.

1323
03:07:36,480 --> 03:07:38,480
I like them big.

1324
03:07:38,480 --> 03:07:44,480
Okay.

1325
03:07:44,480 --> 03:07:48,480
Uh-oh.

1326
03:07:48,480 --> 03:07:50,480
One of my co-workers would say that to me.

1327
03:07:50,480 --> 03:07:54,480
My last job when I would get hit on by someone.

1328
03:07:54,480 --> 03:08:02,480
They'd be like, oh, I think Motomoto likes you.

1329
03:08:02,480 --> 03:08:06,480
What's down here?

1330
03:08:06,480 --> 03:08:10,480
Oh.

1331
03:08:10,480 --> 03:08:14,480
Babies, move. Babies, move.

1332
03:08:14,480 --> 03:08:16,480
Babies, move.

1333
03:08:16,480 --> 03:08:18,480
Please, babies.

1334
03:08:18,480 --> 03:08:20,480
Babies, babies.

1335
03:08:20,480 --> 03:08:22,480
Babies.

1336
03:08:22,480 --> 03:08:30,480
Kill.

1337
03:08:30,480 --> 03:08:32,480
I'm being chased by children.

1338
03:08:32,480 --> 03:08:34,480
Kill the children.

1339
03:08:34,480 --> 03:08:38,480
In Minecraft.

1340
03:08:38,480 --> 03:08:42,480
Being accosted by a child.

1341
03:08:42,480 --> 03:08:46,480
I missed.

1342
03:08:46,480 --> 03:08:48,480
Okay, I got...

1343
03:08:48,480 --> 03:08:50,480
I like how it flips over.

1344
03:08:50,480 --> 03:08:52,480
Okay.

1345
03:08:52,480 --> 03:08:54,480
Uh, this one?

1346
03:08:54,480 --> 03:09:00,480
Was it this grace?

1347
03:09:00,480 --> 03:09:02,480
Oh, is where I beat the lion dancer.

1348
03:09:02,480 --> 03:09:10,480
Okay, let me just hop up here then.

1349
03:09:10,480 --> 03:09:24,480
It sounded like Anakin.

1350
03:09:24,480 --> 03:09:26,480
Yeah, I only have...

1351
03:09:26,480 --> 03:09:28,480
I don't have any...

1352
03:09:28,480 --> 03:09:30,480
I think I have one fragment.

1353
03:09:30,480 --> 03:09:32,480
Okay, it's too...

1354
03:09:32,480 --> 03:09:34,480
Is it to the right?

1355
03:09:34,480 --> 03:09:36,480
Of her?

1356
03:09:36,480 --> 03:09:38,480
Okay, so she's down here.

1357
03:09:38,480 --> 03:09:42,480
She's over here somewhere, grandma.

1358
03:09:42,480 --> 03:09:46,480
I genuinely cannot believe it only took me, like,

1359
03:09:46,480 --> 03:09:48,480
a handful of tries.

1360
03:09:48,480 --> 03:09:50,480
I...

1361
03:09:50,480 --> 03:09:52,480
Amazing boss, though.

1362
03:09:52,480 --> 03:09:54,480
I love the boss.

1363
03:09:54,480 --> 03:09:56,480
But again, I used the mimic, so...

1364
03:09:56,480 --> 03:09:58,480
Although I used it just to really get Diagro off me.

1365
03:09:58,480 --> 03:10:00,480
Hi, Tomah!

1366
03:10:00,480 --> 03:10:02,480
Nowhere I was getting beaten to death by the horde.

1367
03:10:02,480 --> 03:10:04,480
What?

1368
03:10:04,480 --> 03:10:14,480
You like the helmet that you get?

1369
03:10:14,480 --> 03:10:16,480
Oh, it's so funny.

1370
03:10:16,480 --> 03:10:26,480
The jaw is clipping through the armor.

1371
03:10:26,480 --> 03:10:38,480
I'm gonna need that mimic, yeah.

1372
03:10:38,480 --> 03:10:40,480
Damn, would we make it heavy?

1373
03:10:40,480 --> 03:10:44,480
I don't know.

1374
03:10:44,480 --> 03:10:52,480
So that would change that.

1375
03:10:52,480 --> 03:10:54,480
I could do the exile free.

1376
03:10:54,480 --> 03:11:02,480
The damage negation isn't as high.

1377
03:11:02,480 --> 03:11:12,480
I could put on some of my finger maiden shoes.

1378
03:11:12,480 --> 03:11:14,480
A playful game.

1379
03:11:14,480 --> 03:11:16,480
That would be cool.

1380
03:11:16,480 --> 03:11:20,480
Alright, how do I get to this lady?

1381
03:11:20,480 --> 03:11:22,480
I'm not cute, I'm handsome.

1382
03:11:22,480 --> 03:11:24,480
Pinch is your cheek, oo-woo.

1383
03:11:24,480 --> 03:11:26,480
You're just a cute little guy.

1384
03:11:26,480 --> 03:11:30,480
Oh, I thought that was somebody standing behind that.

1385
03:11:30,480 --> 03:11:36,480
Alright.

1386
03:11:36,480 --> 03:11:42,480
Can I hope down?

1387
03:11:42,480 --> 03:11:44,480
Am I gonna die?

1388
03:11:44,480 --> 03:11:46,480
Oh!

1389
03:11:46,480 --> 03:11:52,480
I didn't mean to do that.

1390
03:11:52,480 --> 03:11:54,480
I thought I could drop down to the ledge.

1391
03:11:54,480 --> 03:11:58,480
I suppose not.

1392
03:11:58,480 --> 03:12:02,480
Whoopsie-daisies, no worries.

1393
03:12:02,480 --> 03:12:04,480
At least it's not far.

1394
03:12:04,480 --> 03:12:08,480
Oh, okay, I like the spiral introduction.

1395
03:12:08,480 --> 03:12:14,480
I realize I have like a three musketeers freaking thingy.

1396
03:12:14,480 --> 03:12:32,480
I'm off to see the grandma, the wonderful grandma of Oz.

1397
03:12:32,480 --> 03:12:34,480
Wonderful grandma of Lance between.

1398
03:12:34,480 --> 03:12:38,480
Wonderful grandma of LBs.

1399
03:12:38,480 --> 03:12:40,480
Wait.

1400
03:12:40,480 --> 03:12:42,480
Okay.

1401
03:12:42,480 --> 03:12:44,480
I was like, wait, where was I on the stairs?

1402
03:12:44,480 --> 03:12:56,480
So I can grab these little runey rooms.

1403
03:12:56,480 --> 03:13:00,480
The spiral motif.

1404
03:13:00,480 --> 03:13:04,480
It's all about the horn scent and what they believe in.

1405
03:13:04,480 --> 03:13:08,480
The idea of the spiral is very, very interesting.

1406
03:13:08,480 --> 03:13:10,480
Very holy thing.

1407
03:13:10,480 --> 03:13:12,480
Reaching towards the heavens.

1408
03:13:12,480 --> 03:13:16,480
Oh, what's this then?

1409
03:13:16,480 --> 03:13:18,480
What's this then?

1410
03:13:18,480 --> 03:13:22,480
There's something on the other side.

1411
03:13:22,480 --> 03:13:32,480
These shadowy branches are hiding something.

1412
03:13:32,480 --> 03:13:40,480
Or maybe they're fucking not. Hello?

1413
03:13:40,480 --> 03:13:42,480
Stairway to heaven reference.

1414
03:13:42,480 --> 03:13:52,480
Guys, I thought you said I'd go to the right or the left.

1415
03:13:52,480 --> 03:13:58,480
Izumaki all over again.

1416
03:13:58,480 --> 03:14:00,480
At the second grade.

1417
03:14:00,480 --> 03:14:02,480
What second grade?

1418
03:14:02,480 --> 03:14:04,480
Which one?

1419
03:14:04,480 --> 03:14:06,480
You said this one?

1420
03:14:06,480 --> 03:14:08,480
And you said this one?

1421
03:14:08,480 --> 03:14:10,480
Oh, okay.

1422
03:14:10,480 --> 03:14:18,480
Let me see here.

1423
03:14:18,480 --> 03:14:26,480
Small private altar.

1424
03:14:26,480 --> 03:14:34,480
Yes, I've read all of Junji Ito's works.

1425
03:14:34,480 --> 03:14:36,480
That's...

1426
03:14:36,480 --> 03:14:38,480
Okay.

1427
03:14:38,480 --> 03:14:42,480
Now where do I go?

1428
03:14:42,480 --> 03:14:50,480
Tell me the where.

1429
03:14:50,480 --> 03:14:56,480
Is it this way?

1430
03:14:56,480 --> 03:15:02,480
It is indeed this way.

1431
03:15:02,480 --> 03:15:14,480
Who is jorking their peanuts right now?

1432
03:15:14,480 --> 03:15:24,480
You are not looking so well horn sent.

1433
03:15:24,480 --> 03:15:32,480
I need some of you guys to record something like this for me.

1434
03:15:32,480 --> 03:15:38,480
I watch my stuff be limited because of this.

1435
03:15:38,480 --> 03:15:48,480
Where the hat?

1436
03:15:48,480 --> 03:15:54,480
How about now?

1437
03:15:54,480 --> 03:16:00,480
Hello?

1438
03:16:00,480 --> 03:16:06,480
Are you with two fingers?

1439
03:16:06,480 --> 03:16:16,480
Does it keep her stand before me?

1440
03:16:16,480 --> 03:16:26,480
She's like a finger lady.

1441
03:16:26,480 --> 03:16:32,480
At least it's the same model because it literally looks like her added stuff.

1442
03:16:32,480 --> 03:16:38,480
Like how I'm just staring him in the face.

1443
03:16:38,480 --> 03:16:42,480
Can I see my face?

1444
03:16:42,480 --> 03:16:54,480
No, I cannot.

1445
03:16:54,480 --> 03:17:02,480
Like cholera?

1446
03:17:02,480 --> 03:17:04,480
I don't know. Mesmer didn't really deserve any of this.

1447
03:17:04,480 --> 03:17:06,480
I blame his mom to be honest.

1448
03:17:06,480 --> 03:17:14,480
The family is messed up.

1449
03:17:14,480 --> 03:17:18,480
Just desserts.

1450
03:17:18,480 --> 03:17:20,480
Song?

1451
03:17:20,480 --> 03:17:30,480
That's your son is a watchful spirit?

1452
03:17:30,480 --> 03:17:32,480
Or dude.

1453
03:17:32,480 --> 03:17:40,480
Thanks I guess.

1454
03:17:40,480 --> 03:17:48,480
If I take this off will you be like traumatized?

1455
03:17:48,480 --> 03:17:50,480
I'm going to dance in cavort.

1456
03:17:50,480 --> 03:17:52,480
Oh I could have just grabbed this.

1457
03:17:52,480 --> 03:18:02,480
I could have just stolen this.

1458
03:18:02,480 --> 03:18:04,480
Can't break any of these.

1459
03:18:04,480 --> 03:18:06,480
You didn't care about those pots did you?

1460
03:18:06,480 --> 03:18:12,480
I hope not.

1461
03:18:12,480 --> 03:18:16,480
It's all the horn sent and the America's fault.

1462
03:18:16,480 --> 03:18:18,480
Wait.

1463
03:18:18,480 --> 03:18:28,480
What?

1464
03:18:28,480 --> 03:18:40,480
Is this grandma?

1465
03:18:40,480 --> 03:18:44,480
Oh somebody said him so I don't know if it's the same person.

1466
03:18:44,480 --> 03:18:46,480
Can I leave?

1467
03:18:46,480 --> 03:18:48,480
Cool beans.

1468
03:18:48,480 --> 03:18:52,480
Can't get over there yet.

1469
03:18:52,480 --> 03:18:56,480
Oh my god lady shut up.

1470
03:18:56,480 --> 03:19:04,480
I guess we'll go through here.

1471
03:19:04,480 --> 03:19:12,480
At the castle front.

1472
03:19:12,480 --> 03:19:20,480
Thank you.

1473
03:19:20,480 --> 03:19:28,480
I think I might make myself a PB&J.

1474
03:19:28,480 --> 03:19:32,480
Hello?

1475
03:19:32,480 --> 03:19:34,480
I'm the juggernaut bitch.

1476
03:19:34,480 --> 03:19:38,480
Castle ensus.

1477
03:19:38,480 --> 03:19:40,480
Oh you have a giant carrion sword.

1478
03:19:40,480 --> 03:19:44,480
My stuff is probably going to be totally non-resistant to you.

1479
03:19:44,480 --> 03:19:48,480
Yep.

1480
03:19:48,480 --> 03:19:50,480
Yep.

1481
03:19:50,480 --> 03:19:54,480
That sounds about right.

1482
03:19:54,480 --> 03:19:58,480
Break out locking on you.

1483
03:19:58,480 --> 03:20:00,480
I need a different weapon.

1484
03:20:00,480 --> 03:20:06,480
This is going to be something to do against them.

1485
03:20:06,480 --> 03:20:18,480
I need another weapon to level up.

1486
03:20:18,480 --> 03:20:26,480
Why is there nowhere to go?

1487
03:20:26,480 --> 03:20:28,480
Extra stream great fighting for voice.

1488
03:20:28,480 --> 03:20:30,480
I have a good time at work.

1489
03:20:30,480 --> 03:20:36,480
Hi hi welcome in.

1490
03:20:36,480 --> 03:20:40,480
Yeah what?

1491
03:20:40,480 --> 03:20:46,480
Yeah it seems like I am in a bit of a conundrum here.

1492
03:20:46,480 --> 03:20:50,480
Let's not go here yet then.

1493
03:20:50,480 --> 03:20:54,480
Because if they're going to be magic based people then...

1494
03:20:54,480 --> 03:20:58,480
I'm not going to have the best time.

1495
03:20:58,480 --> 03:21:02,480
Oh my god if you fall off that would be kind of incredible.

1496
03:21:02,480 --> 03:21:06,480
Can you?

1497
03:21:06,480 --> 03:21:08,480
No, damn it.

1498
03:21:08,480 --> 03:21:16,480
I was hoping I could knock you off.

1499
03:21:16,480 --> 03:21:24,480
Oh.

1500
03:21:24,480 --> 03:21:28,480
I'm also trying to figure out the way inside.

1501
03:21:28,480 --> 03:21:30,480
Oh I think I go around him.

1502
03:21:30,480 --> 03:21:38,480
I'm not straightforward.

1503
03:21:38,480 --> 03:21:40,480
Yeah okay so I'll get past them then.

1504
03:21:40,480 --> 03:21:42,480
I have a feeling.

1505
03:21:42,480 --> 03:22:10,480
Maybe I should just keep going until I get it.

1506
03:22:10,480 --> 03:22:18,480
Hit me.

1507
03:22:18,480 --> 03:22:24,480
Yeah why don't you go over there buddy?

1508
03:22:24,480 --> 03:22:26,480
Alright.

1509
03:22:26,480 --> 03:22:30,480
How long are you going to chase me for?

1510
03:22:30,480 --> 03:22:32,480
Is there a grace over here?

1511
03:22:32,480 --> 03:22:46,480
That would be great.

1512
03:22:46,480 --> 03:22:50,480
Oh my god is he still here? Holy crap.

1513
03:22:50,480 --> 03:22:54,480
I'm scared. Oh no I'm scared.

1514
03:22:55,480 --> 03:22:57,480
Oh and this?

1515
03:22:57,480 --> 03:23:12,480
The runner?

1516
03:23:12,480 --> 03:23:24,480
I just hear the giant walking around so it's freaking me out.

1517
03:23:24,480 --> 03:23:26,480
Time for the funny sword.

1518
03:23:26,480 --> 03:23:30,480
Assuming there's a sword up here.

1519
03:23:30,480 --> 03:23:32,480
Might I just get teleported somewhere?

1520
03:23:32,480 --> 03:23:36,480
If I just get teleported to Caled I would actually lose my mind.

1521
03:23:36,480 --> 03:23:44,480
Milady?

1522
03:23:44,480 --> 03:23:50,480
What the heck type of sword is it?

1523
03:23:50,480 --> 03:24:00,480
It's a light? A light great sword?

1524
03:24:00,480 --> 03:24:14,480
How does that happen?

1525
03:24:14,480 --> 03:24:30,480
Oh.

1526
03:24:30,480 --> 03:24:36,480
Yeah I meant it when I said I climb you like a tree.

1527
03:24:36,480 --> 03:24:38,480
How did I get out of the town?

1528
03:24:38,480 --> 03:24:41,480
I better if I jump down I'm going to die.

1529
03:24:41,480 --> 03:24:45,480
I'm fine.

1530
03:24:45,480 --> 03:24:47,480
I speak for the trees.

1531
03:24:47,480 --> 03:24:53,480
Oh someone's missing stone.

1532
03:24:53,480 --> 03:24:57,480
It's a sturdy tree because I'm a thick boy.

1533
03:24:57,480 --> 03:24:59,480
Is he? He's not aggro.

1534
03:24:59,480 --> 03:25:11,480
I was hoping there wasn't a side of Grace nearby that I could just sneak around him for.

1535
03:25:11,480 --> 03:25:14,480
Okay so I got that.

1536
03:25:14,480 --> 03:25:23,480
Hold on let me switch back to my actual up in the nose using before.

1537
03:25:23,480 --> 03:25:28,480
Okay that's that over there.

1538
03:25:28,480 --> 03:25:36,480
Whoa what's all the way up there?

1539
03:25:36,480 --> 03:25:38,480
Wait a second.

1540
03:25:38,480 --> 03:25:40,480
Is there something above this?

1541
03:25:40,480 --> 03:25:44,480
Oh wait no that was just there. Holy crap.

1542
03:25:44,480 --> 03:25:46,480
Was I?

1543
03:25:46,480 --> 03:25:48,480
I don't know. I don't think so.

1544
03:25:48,480 --> 03:25:50,480
I think it's a different area.

1545
03:25:50,480 --> 03:25:53,480
I think that's passed over here.

1546
03:25:53,480 --> 03:25:57,480
Yeah it is. Isn't it?

1547
03:25:57,480 --> 03:25:59,480
Every player's nightmare is up there.

1548
03:25:59,480 --> 03:26:02,480
Oh man.

1549
03:26:02,480 --> 03:26:11,480
Can't wait.

1550
03:26:11,480 --> 03:26:12,480
How am I?

1551
03:26:12,480 --> 03:26:14,480
Stop showing me things that I can't get to yet.

1552
03:26:14,480 --> 03:26:21,480
It's annoying.

1553
03:26:21,480 --> 03:26:28,480
Something gonna fall and attack me? No.

1554
03:26:28,480 --> 03:26:33,480
I'm just looking around every corner.

1555
03:26:33,480 --> 03:26:42,480
Who's in here? Is it a dude? No?

1556
03:26:42,480 --> 03:26:47,480
Royal Knights cookbook.

1557
03:26:47,480 --> 03:26:50,480
Magic Grace. Royal Magic Grace.

1558
03:26:50,480 --> 03:26:53,480
Coat's armament.

1559
03:26:53,480 --> 03:26:57,480
Oh wait no I read that as armor.

1560
03:26:57,480 --> 03:27:04,480
Cool.

1561
03:27:04,480 --> 03:27:11,480
I don't have any pots.

1562
03:27:11,480 --> 03:27:19,480
Man flowers.

1563
03:27:19,480 --> 03:27:23,480
Hefty Fireball.

1564
03:27:23,480 --> 03:27:30,480
Crystal Blood Pot.

1565
03:27:30,480 --> 03:27:35,480
Grace me up baby.

1566
03:27:35,480 --> 03:27:39,480
Oh where the hell did you come from?

1567
03:27:39,480 --> 03:27:59,480
I don't know what to use on here.

1568
03:27:59,480 --> 03:28:08,480
Holy guacamole.

1569
03:28:08,480 --> 03:28:16,480
Oh my.

1570
03:28:16,480 --> 03:28:29,480
That was surprising.

1571
03:28:29,480 --> 03:28:35,480
What?

1572
03:28:35,480 --> 03:28:40,480
All right.

1573
03:28:40,480 --> 03:28:42,480
All right, all right, all right.

1574
03:28:42,480 --> 03:28:44,480
Okay no ladies.

1575
03:28:44,480 --> 03:28:45,480
Yeah.

1576
03:28:45,480 --> 03:28:48,480
I said what's cooler than being cool?

1577
03:28:48,480 --> 03:28:49,480
I just couldn't.

1578
03:28:49,480 --> 03:28:50,480
I can't hear you.

1579
03:28:50,480 --> 03:28:52,480
I said what's being cool?

1580
03:28:52,480 --> 03:28:54,480
What's cooler than being cool?

1581
03:28:54,480 --> 03:29:04,480
I just couldn't.

1582
03:29:04,480 --> 03:29:24,480
It's harder because it's dark out.

1583
03:29:24,480 --> 03:29:32,480
Can you get your dog off me?

1584
03:29:32,480 --> 03:29:36,480
He's still following me.

1585
03:29:36,480 --> 03:29:42,480
Is your owner still following me too?

1586
03:29:42,480 --> 03:29:54,480
Oh he just eventually walked over here as a thing.

1587
03:29:54,480 --> 03:30:07,480
No I don't want to run all the way back up there.

1588
03:30:07,480 --> 03:30:08,480
It's okay.

1589
03:30:08,480 --> 03:30:15,480
It looks like I can use Moonvale over here.

1590
03:30:15,480 --> 03:30:26,480
This is good if I don't want to use Meal though.

1591
03:30:26,480 --> 03:30:29,480
Guys are pretty easy to backstab.

1592
03:30:29,480 --> 03:30:31,480
Oh okay.

1593
03:30:31,480 --> 03:30:32,480
They usually are.

1594
03:30:32,480 --> 03:30:44,480
Usually like those knights are able to backstab.

1595
03:30:44,480 --> 03:30:47,480
This troll just follows me all the way up.

1596
03:30:47,480 --> 03:30:55,480
I remember I was watching a thing as this like beating Elden Ring when every boss is constantly aggro and there's no aggro limit.

1597
03:30:55,480 --> 03:31:00,480
They'll follow you anywhere.

1598
03:31:00,480 --> 03:31:09,480
It's like the snail.

1599
03:31:09,480 --> 03:31:24,480
I'm sorry puppy I'm busy.

1600
03:31:24,480 --> 03:31:31,480
That's it.

1601
03:31:31,480 --> 03:31:35,860
You're a hundred percenting but uh bloodborne. That's cool. I want to play bloodborne. I've never played bloodborne

1602
03:31:39,620 --> 03:31:45,900
What are these doing over here? Oh, is there another one? Oh, I got helpful

1603
03:31:53,700 --> 03:31:55,700
Do I have enough now

1604
03:31:57,940 --> 03:31:59,940
Yay

1605
03:32:01,480 --> 03:32:03,480
Oh

1606
03:32:04,200 --> 03:32:07,880
But wait, what are you? Hello, what are you doing here?

1607
03:32:17,800 --> 03:32:22,860
Why do I hear someone like running up? Okay, I'm not gonna hop down there yet. I want to kill this guy

1608
03:32:25,040 --> 03:32:28,400
See if he drops anything good, although I know he's not like

1609
03:32:32,480 --> 03:32:34,480
Oh, I thought I dodged that

1610
03:32:37,080 --> 03:32:39,640
Thought I dodged that as well, but I was a second too late

1611
03:32:47,600 --> 03:32:57,700
You a hundred percented Sekiro, what is wrong with you? How do you know how do you do that? That's wild to me

1612
03:33:01,480 --> 03:33:03,480
I

1613
03:33:11,120 --> 03:33:13,120
Missed I

1614
03:33:19,200 --> 03:33:21,200
Died to the shocky ground

1615
03:33:31,480 --> 03:33:33,480
You

1616
03:34:01,480 --> 03:34:03,480
You

1617
03:34:31,480 --> 03:34:33,480
You

1618
03:35:01,480 --> 03:35:03,480
I

1619
03:35:03,480 --> 03:35:05,480
I

1620
03:35:05,480 --> 03:35:07,480
I

1621
03:35:07,480 --> 03:35:34,360
I've been talking this whole time Bumi just muted me. I'm so sorry

1622
03:35:34,360 --> 03:35:46,160
Let me put his paw his back paw on my go XLR. I hope I haven't been how long have I been quiet for cuz that's annoying

1623
03:36:04,360 --> 03:36:06,360
I

1624
03:36:14,360 --> 03:36:16,360
My god, please

1625
03:36:16,360 --> 03:36:18,360
I

1626
03:36:31,880 --> 03:36:34,960
I meant to press B no

1627
03:36:40,840 --> 03:36:43,020
This is a boomy train that silenced me

1628
03:36:46,360 --> 03:36:53,680
Just want to kill him I'm dying to him faster than the the dancing beast

1629
03:37:17,360 --> 03:37:21,920
What I like I it's like when I stood up I was still in the hitbox or something

1630
03:37:26,760 --> 03:37:28,760
For me don't

1631
03:37:30,800 --> 03:37:32,800
He just muted me again

1632
03:37:33,400 --> 03:37:35,560
Big me and all you look so tired

1633
03:37:35,560 --> 03:37:47,080
Just for you because I gave Fia your old one

1634
03:38:05,560 --> 03:38:07,560
I

1635
03:38:14,600 --> 03:38:16,860
Can't break his poise. I don't know why I'm trying to

1636
03:38:24,920 --> 03:38:31,640
That's a good point and I can't really see that well past boomy cuz he's taking up probably a fourth or a third of my screen

1637
03:38:32,360 --> 03:38:37,000
This night and another story

1638
03:38:42,280 --> 03:38:45,400
Sometimes I'm also very sleepy, so I'm not really trying hard

1639
03:38:50,280 --> 03:38:52,280
Like I should be

1640
03:39:01,640 --> 03:39:03,640
I

1641
03:39:10,080 --> 03:39:16,720
What what come on why am I playing so bad?

1642
03:39:24,600 --> 03:39:28,660
Camera is harder he is smoking me

1643
03:39:32,480 --> 03:39:36,160
How much of a do this

1644
03:39:50,600 --> 03:39:52,600
Move your freaking shield

1645
03:40:01,640 --> 03:40:03,640
I

1646
03:40:09,240 --> 03:40:12,160
Wish I had the ambush that would have been nice

1647
03:40:21,200 --> 03:40:24,280
I was stunned and I couldn't roll out of the wall

1648
03:40:32,080 --> 03:40:38,320
No, I don't think so I want to kill him

1649
03:40:43,280 --> 03:40:45,280
Yeah

1650
03:40:49,560 --> 03:40:52,960
I was I've been trying to roll behind him and backstab him again

1651
03:41:01,640 --> 03:41:03,640
Oh

1652
03:41:32,640 --> 03:41:35,280
I didn't think he was gonna do it three times

1653
03:41:37,640 --> 03:41:39,640
It's hard to roll around him cuz he like

1654
03:41:40,320 --> 03:41:44,160
Sometimes they just lock on and they just move on there like they just pivot

1655
03:41:44,720 --> 03:41:48,400
With what doesn't make any sense. They just like spin around

1656
03:41:49,520 --> 03:41:55,160
While doing their thing and it's funny because you can't do that as a player boomy when are you doing?

1657
03:41:55,280 --> 03:41:57,480
He just turned around as easily know my desk

1658
03:41:58,480 --> 03:42:03,200
And he's now he's watching my screen and grooming himself. No boomy. I can't see past you

1659
03:42:04,760 --> 03:42:09,280
Boomy is now taking up half of my screen. I'm going to fight with one half of my screen

1660
03:42:12,880 --> 03:42:19,000
No, I blame you so hard. I can't see can't backstab

1661
03:42:20,320 --> 03:42:22,320
It's safe. Oh

1662
03:42:23,080 --> 03:42:29,800
No boomy just laid on my no boomy boomy boomy boomy please boomy please boomy please boomy no

1663
03:42:45,040 --> 03:42:48,160
He laid on my windows key and tapped out my game

Black Knight hammer guy

1678
03:45:04,760 --> 03:45:10,800
It iron table on my head you shouldn't be able to kill me in two hits. He's not a boss

1679
03:45:13,120 --> 03:45:16,600
He doesn't deserve that sort of power I'm going to take it from him

1680
03:45:33,920 --> 03:45:35,920

He just looks like he pushes his arm like a mile away from him

1686
03:46:10,920 --> 03:46:16,080

1701
03:48:34,520 --> 03:48:36,520
That's all

1702
03:48:40,120 --> 03:48:42,120
Wait, I thought I had more

1703
03:48:46,040 --> 03:48:48,040

1708
03:49:15,720 --> 03:49:17,720

03:49:42,120 --> 03:49:44,120
Can I not go this way

1711
03:49:46,600 --> 03:49:49,160
But then I would have to jump down

1712
03:49:51,160 --> 03:49:53,160
Uh-oh not resin

1713
03:50:00,120 --> 03:50:02,120
I

1714
03:50:08,360 --> 03:50:12,120
Just again, why do you have to be mad? It's just game

1715
03:50:18,680 --> 03:50:22,200
It's just arrow why you have to be mad

1716
03:50:30,200 --> 03:50:32,200
I

1717
03:50:37,480 --> 03:50:41,560

1719
03:50:55,640 --> 03:50:57,640
Burb

1720
03:50:58,280 --> 03:51:06,120
I don't care about starlight shards. Give me cool armor. Oh almost fell

1721
03:51:11,160 --> 03:51:13,560
Who do we ask when we don't know what's way to go

1722
03:51:20,520 --> 03:51:22,520
Ever just exploded

1723
03:51:25,000 --> 03:51:27,000
Just thinks of uh

1724
03:51:27,880 --> 03:51:29,880
Shrek or Fiona singing

1725
03:51:31,320 --> 03:51:33,320
Mortis

1726
03:51:35,480 --> 03:51:37,480
Oh, no, how do I get back just kidding

1727
03:51:40,840 --> 03:51:42,840
Gravity gravity got me good

1728
03:51:57,880 --> 03:51:59,880
Fast mate who's next

1729
03:52:04,360 --> 03:52:06,680
Why does it take three hits to kill you should only take two

1730
03:52:16,680 --> 03:52:18,680
Burb

1731
03:52:21,160 --> 03:52:23,480
Why does there a bird explode over there

1732
03:52:24,440 --> 03:52:27,880
Another one died over there that doesn't make any sense to me

1733
03:52:30,600 --> 03:52:33,880
Don't tell me my runes are down there

1734
03:52:37,800 --> 03:52:39,800
Where are my runes?

1735
03:52:50,440 --> 03:52:52,440
Okay, I was gonna say

1736
03:52:54,440 --> 03:52:57,880
I was gonna say I sorry, I forgot that there was a gap here

1737
03:53:06,600 --> 03:53:08,600
Hello little fellas

1738
03:53:09,480 --> 03:53:11,880
Get out of the way. I'm gonna kill you little mouse

1739
03:53:12,440 --> 03:53:17,240
Just kidding. You know what you escaped with your life. You you you dodged me

1740
03:53:17,400 --> 03:53:19,400
You dodged me

1741
03:53:22,200 --> 03:53:25,800
Uh realistically I would slip off of these rocks in in a heartbeat

1742
03:53:27,800 --> 03:53:32,840
Oh, hello tortle. Hello tortle. Hello dog

1743
03:53:34,360 --> 03:53:38,200
Dog, what are you guys eating? There's nothing there. Oh, you're kind of eating some moss

1744
03:53:41,480 --> 03:53:44,840
Oh my god, so you gave me motion sick that's moving back

1745
03:53:48,200 --> 03:53:50,200
All right, we got a ladder

1746
03:53:53,800 --> 03:53:55,800
I like the waterfalls

1747
03:54:02,600 --> 03:54:07,880
What's in here? What's in here? What's in here? I'm trying to see if I can lock on anything in here

1748
03:54:09,400 --> 03:54:11,400
Not resin

1749
03:54:12,120 --> 03:54:19,000
It's not resin, I'll tell you that it's really cool because it looks like fire my lantern thermolite

1750
03:54:21,000 --> 03:54:23,000
Dog

1751
03:54:23,960 --> 03:54:25,960
It's not a little bit of a dog

1752
03:54:27,960 --> 03:54:29,960
All right

1753
03:54:32,840 --> 03:54:34,840
Time to climb

1754
03:54:41,720 --> 03:54:43,720
Hmm

1755
03:54:47,000 --> 03:54:51,000
You ain't give me a grace up here. Oh, I had feeling someone was gonna be around there

1756
03:54:53,720 --> 03:55:00,520
You're gonna knock me off aren't you? Yep. Goodbye my people need me

1757
03:55:12,360 --> 03:55:16,360
It's not resin

1758
03:55:24,280 --> 03:55:26,280
You're dinosaurs to tear

1759
03:55:30,920 --> 03:55:37,000
Does anybody else gonna jump out try to kill me? Oh what I can't open that to go back

1760
03:55:37,960 --> 03:55:41,160
Oh, yes, I can actually push

1761
03:55:45,480 --> 03:55:47,480
I always love me a good uh

1762
03:55:48,600 --> 03:55:54,440
That I would have to open that a lot more. I always like me a good uh walk back to do with the grace

1763
03:55:54,440 --> 03:55:57,320
Those are my favorite. They're really well laid out and right lies of pee

1764
03:55:57,400 --> 03:55:59,400
Oh

1765
03:56:01,400 --> 03:56:06,680
Enjoy the Deadpool movie. It was great. It was so good. It like blew all my expectations out of the water

1766
03:56:06,760 --> 03:56:08,760
I hope you enjoy it. Have a good one

1767
03:56:13,640 --> 03:56:15,640
All right

1768
03:56:18,680 --> 03:56:20,680
Oh

1769
03:56:21,480 --> 03:56:23,480
Oh

1770
03:56:25,080 --> 03:56:30,760
Mesmer's soldiers acts. Oh, am I gonna go kill mesmer?

1771
03:56:32,280 --> 03:56:34,280
Oh

1772
03:56:36,120 --> 03:56:40,920
I've seen mesmer's boss battle. It looks actually insane. So I hope that mesmer's not good by

1773
03:56:41,800 --> 03:56:45,000
That would be awkward. Ow. That was pretty good, bro

1774
03:56:46,040 --> 03:56:48,040
Did that really well

1775
03:56:48,840 --> 03:56:53,640
You're doing you doing it. You're doing it. Well, stop giving me freaking string actual string is

1776
03:56:54,520 --> 03:56:57,080
Point for draw string stuff, but I'm not really using that

1777
03:56:58,680 --> 03:57:01,320
I thought that was a ladder I could use it's not

1778
03:57:03,240 --> 03:57:05,640
Is there a dog over here that I just have something to cross?

1779
03:57:07,160 --> 03:57:11,880
Oh, I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. You're a bigger dog

1780
03:57:12,840 --> 03:57:14,840
I

1781
03:57:17,000 --> 03:57:24,920
Saw you coming one a mile away. I thought I saw it up here though, which is funny. Um, all right

1782
03:57:32,280 --> 03:57:34,280
I'm under the business. So this year is good

1783
03:57:35,960 --> 03:57:37,960
Oh, bro. What are you doing up here?

1784
03:57:42,760 --> 03:57:44,760
Yeah, the Deadpool movies are great

1785
03:57:47,160 --> 03:57:49,160
Yeah, I don't get that

1786
03:57:49,720 --> 03:57:52,440
I think people just don't like like if you're not

1787
03:57:53,480 --> 03:57:55,880
A like a fan of superhero movies

1788
03:57:58,040 --> 03:58:00,040
Oh my god

1789
03:58:01,000 --> 03:58:03,000
Oh

1790
03:58:11,400 --> 03:58:13,400
We're an aristocrat you're a risk to annoying

1791
03:58:18,360 --> 03:58:21,880
Boomi, are you laying on something I can't look I can't cast a spell

1792
03:58:25,080 --> 03:58:27,080
Oh, you're on my mouse. That's why

1793
03:58:30,360 --> 03:58:34,280
Boomi boomi. No, you sure it's making me attack for no reason

1794
03:58:37,960 --> 03:58:39,960
There we go

1795
03:58:43,080 --> 03:58:47,320
How'd you get up there my blood last time how'd you get up there, bro?

1796
03:58:49,960 --> 03:58:51,960
I can't do it

1797
03:58:53,800 --> 03:58:58,040
Muthril this won't do shit against you

1798
03:59:01,000 --> 03:59:07,080
Ha one hit one kill you look at the same we are wearing the same outfit

1799
03:59:11,560 --> 03:59:13,960
Yo, what's that guy carry a night rematch

1800
03:59:18,440 --> 03:59:21,800
If your Deadpool is you to pull he controls the galaxy

1801
03:59:22,440 --> 03:59:28,520
And he doesn't wish for people to die just his heart's better. They're bad and they're good. Give him a good ending. Oh

1802
03:59:31,000 --> 03:59:33,000
Oh

1803
03:59:33,880 --> 03:59:36,680
This uh, but like you superhero movies this is a marvel

1804
03:59:37,240 --> 03:59:38,840
Sorry, no, I don't think I finished my thought

1805
03:59:38,840 --> 03:59:44,360
I meant like if you don't know who Deadpool is like if you don't know he how how much he breaks

1806
03:59:46,200 --> 03:59:49,880
The uh, wait, I'm supposed to go all the way around again. How much he breaks the fourth wall

1807
03:59:49,960 --> 03:59:52,520
You're gonna think it's like they're explaining the movie

1808
04:00:01,000 --> 04:00:03,000
Wait what?

1809
04:00:15,400 --> 04:00:19,640
It'd be funny if there was like a time outer god that rewinds time

1810
04:00:20,280 --> 04:00:26,600
That one makes a lot of sense because they explain why you die like the game the dying mechanic, but imagine

1811
04:00:27,560 --> 04:00:33,260
Like explaining the why do they always respawn and ag re-aggro you like they never met you before a mechanic

1812
04:00:34,600 --> 04:00:36,600
Where are you dog?

1813
04:00:39,800 --> 04:00:43,240
I missed you you're gonna kill me dog aren't you?

1814
04:00:45,000 --> 04:00:47,000
There you are

1815
04:00:50,520 --> 04:00:54,200
Because time is also like all the other gods represents a form of death

1816
04:00:57,240 --> 04:01:00,440
So I was taking the making a piss in the bush here

1817
04:01:12,440 --> 04:01:17,720
Castle anxious castle anxious, I'm sorry

1818
04:01:22,360 --> 04:01:24,360
Pass y'all

1819
04:01:26,600 --> 04:01:31,560
I realized I lost my 100k runes, but that's fine. I just realized that

1820
04:01:36,040 --> 04:01:38,040
I'm not gonna bother with y'all

1821
04:01:57,240 --> 04:02:00,840
Okay, I need to kill the dog because like a dog follows me

1822
04:02:04,680 --> 04:02:06,680
The dogs always look so sickly

1823
04:02:08,200 --> 04:02:10,760
Boomi why is your mouth open? I can see your little teeth

1824
04:02:12,360 --> 04:02:14,360
Boomi your tooth is poking out

1825
04:02:18,040 --> 04:02:20,040
Keep your teeth in your mouth, sir

1826
04:02:26,600 --> 04:02:28,600
I

1827
04:02:30,120 --> 04:02:32,840
It's funny that their outfits are green to me

1828
04:02:32,840 --> 04:02:34,840
Okay

1829
04:02:55,240 --> 04:02:57,720
It's just a bazillion magic glint blades

1830
04:02:57,720 --> 04:02:59,720
Oh

1831
04:03:01,160 --> 04:03:03,160
Yeah

1832
04:03:04,680 --> 04:03:08,040
Is that the case facts bro

1833
04:03:15,720 --> 04:03:20,360
I can't believe they're using same rat and dog home models. Yeah, they're just recoloring them

1834
04:03:22,040 --> 04:03:23,880
They're all just skinny dogs

1835
04:03:23,880 --> 04:03:29,880
I don't get it. I don't know why they don't use like like the wolves or something just make them on fire

1836
04:03:32,760 --> 04:03:34,760
Or have like a green collar

1837
04:03:40,280 --> 04:03:42,280
It doesn't even let me lock on

1838
04:03:53,880 --> 04:03:55,880
Oh

1839
04:03:55,880 --> 04:03:57,880
So

1840
04:04:20,760 --> 04:04:22,760
This is where

1841
04:04:26,440 --> 04:04:35,400
Is this the top of the thingy oh, there's stuff over here

1842
04:04:39,320 --> 04:04:41,320
I think he just sounds a curious

1843
04:04:48,120 --> 04:04:50,120
Something tells me a graze is nearby

1844
04:04:56,840 --> 04:04:59,480
Does demon souls have rats it's a good question

1845
04:05:02,520 --> 04:05:04,520
Another she be in the matrix, what do you mean?

1846
04:05:12,440 --> 04:05:17,320
Well think about like how many enemies you come across in this game it makes sense that you kind of just want to

1847
04:05:18,600 --> 04:05:21,800
Reskin and just focus on the lore in the building

1848
04:05:26,280 --> 04:05:28,280
Ah, bitch

1849
04:05:29,080 --> 04:05:31,080
I'll kill the dog over here

1850
04:05:45,320 --> 04:05:51,000
Okay, who me I blame you because you got up and gotten the way and I couldn't see

1851
04:05:56,600 --> 04:06:02,040
Oh, I can't see past your head, but that's fine

1852
04:06:06,280 --> 04:06:10,760
Oh booby best cat debatable, I think he's gonna fall asleep on my mute button

1853
04:06:10,920 --> 04:06:15,880
So if I go quiet again, that is why because his head is nodding off right near the mute button

1854
04:06:16,680 --> 04:06:18,680
On my go XLR

1855
04:06:25,880 --> 04:06:27,880
So

1856
04:06:55,880 --> 04:06:58,680
The dog just randomly diagros over here, okay

1857
04:07:26,040 --> 04:07:28,040
Ah

1858
04:07:28,040 --> 04:07:30,040
Oh

1859
04:07:30,040 --> 04:07:32,040
Oh

1860
04:07:32,040 --> 04:07:34,040
Ah

1861
04:07:54,840 --> 04:07:56,840
He's gonna develop so confident

1862
04:08:02,760 --> 04:08:05,960
I probably should use a different weapon

1863
04:08:08,520 --> 04:08:12,200
But like I don't really have a weapon that I like and I want to use yet

1864
04:08:32,040 --> 04:08:34,040
So

1865
04:08:40,760 --> 04:08:42,760
No bad doggie

1866
04:08:42,760 --> 04:08:44,760
I

1867
04:08:58,600 --> 04:09:01,480
Was like really hoping I didn't aggro him, but I did

1868
04:09:08,360 --> 04:09:12,040
Not here I'm not here. Oh Jesus Christ

1869
04:09:13,080 --> 04:09:18,120
There's no point in doing that's not gonna do anything

1870
04:09:30,520 --> 04:09:32,520
I did like the backhand blades

1871
04:09:36,280 --> 04:09:38,280
Maybe I'll use those

1872
04:09:43,160 --> 04:09:45,160
Oh

1873
04:09:45,480 --> 04:09:47,480
Oh

1874
04:10:10,760 --> 04:10:12,760
Wait, I forget how there we go

1875
04:10:15,560 --> 04:10:17,560
I

1876
04:10:17,960 --> 04:10:25,800
Call that style point make them cold. Uh, I actually don't know what ash of war. It's not where I'm going

1877
04:10:32,920 --> 04:10:38,920

1878
04:10:46,040 --> 04:10:48,040

I can make it blood

1881
04:11:09,800 --> 04:11:11,800
Uh, I don't know if that's the case

1882
04:11:11,880 --> 04:11:13,880
What

1883
04:11:17,960 --> 04:11:20,600
Do I not have any freaking money? I don't

1884
04:11:31,160 --> 04:11:34,760
Yeah, I didn't have any money. Sorry I had to crush something in my hands

1885
04:11:42,760 --> 04:11:44,760
I

1886
04:11:46,360 --> 04:11:48,360
Sick

1887
04:11:54,040 --> 04:11:56,040

04:12:11,800 --> 04:12:13,800
I

1890
04:12:32,680 --> 04:12:39,240
We just knocked off my wrist rest and he's laying on my mute button and I'm surprised it hasn't gone off yet

1891
04:12:41,800 --> 04:12:44,600
Let's finish dinner. Nice. What'd you eat?

1892
04:12:46,840 --> 04:12:48,840
Brother, let's go

1893
04:12:51,000 --> 04:12:53,000
I'm gonna test it on him

1894
04:12:55,320 --> 04:13:01,160
That's not what I wanted to do that's a stop let me kill you

1895
04:13:05,560 --> 04:13:07,560
I don't think this is gonna make enough damage

1896
04:13:12,360 --> 04:13:14,360
No, I don't want to go this way

1897
04:13:18,360 --> 04:13:20,360
Homie cheeseburger nice

1898
04:13:23,000 --> 04:13:25,000
The level are they they're level eight

1899
04:13:42,440 --> 04:13:44,440
I

1900
04:14:00,360 --> 04:14:04,440
Hate what the heck? I don't know if they're whispering or freaks me out. Ah

1901
04:14:12,760 --> 04:14:15,400
Dude the dog's gonna freaking kill me

1902
04:14:22,520 --> 04:14:24,520
I did not go down here

1903
04:14:32,680 --> 04:14:36,120
Yeah, never mind

1904
04:14:41,800 --> 04:14:43,800
I

1905
04:14:47,960 --> 04:14:51,720
Still I do like that sword a lot though. Um, I do have the

1906
04:14:53,720 --> 04:14:57,880
I don't really have anything that scales with I have a carrying a knight sword

1907
04:15:03,960 --> 04:15:05,960
And possibly could level that up

1908
04:15:12,200 --> 04:15:16,040
Oh, there's no point. I'd rather not. Why would I why would I why would I do that?

1909
04:15:16,680 --> 04:15:20,760
Why would I fight kill the carry and I with its own probably pretty bad? So, um

1910
04:15:23,080 --> 04:15:26,680
Yeah, I just don't have strength that's been so relaxed

1911
04:15:34,360 --> 04:15:36,360
Don't got a lot to work with people

1912
04:15:37,080 --> 04:15:42,280
I can't even use bloodhound thing

1913
04:15:42,280 --> 04:15:44,280
So

1914
04:16:06,200 --> 04:16:08,200
How did that arrow freaking get me

1915
04:16:12,440 --> 04:16:14,440
She

1916
04:16:22,600 --> 04:16:24,600
Oh my god

1917
04:16:42,600 --> 04:16:44,600
Oh

1918
04:16:52,760 --> 04:16:55,400
I'm tired of running up these freaking stairs dude

1919
04:16:56,520 --> 04:17:00,440
I might come back to him later because I just I cannot be asked to try to kill him right now

1920
04:17:01,160 --> 04:17:03,400
I'd rather go look for a closer side of grace

1921
04:17:13,240 --> 04:17:16,200
Cool or moonville for my dungeon. Yeah

1922
04:17:19,000 --> 04:17:21,400
I didn't know there were stairs there. So let me go down those stairs

1923
04:17:23,240 --> 04:17:26,200
I'm just avoid him completely because I've gotten everything I need over there

1924
04:17:26,200 --> 04:17:28,200
Okay

1925
04:17:40,520 --> 04:17:43,000
Up now I think it's right now still

1926
04:17:43,000 --> 04:17:45,000
I

1927
04:17:57,880 --> 04:18:01,400
Can I knock him off can I cheese him that way and knock him off?

1928
04:18:04,520 --> 04:18:06,520
Oh

1929
04:18:13,320 --> 04:18:15,320
Oh, is he gonna come down here?

1930
04:18:21,800 --> 04:18:29,560
Oh, just scared the absolute crap out of me. Oh my god that jump scared me so bad

1931
04:18:29,560 --> 04:18:31,560
I

1932
04:18:41,160 --> 04:18:43,160
Don't even get to get here what that guy said

1933
04:18:51,640 --> 04:18:53,800
I wanted to just get what the guy was

1934
04:19:00,360 --> 04:19:02,360
Oh

1935
04:19:03,000 --> 04:19:05,000

I

1940
04:19:35,640 --> 04:19:39,720
Think there was more stuff over there, but it really just wanted grace

1941
04:19:42,360 --> 04:19:45,720
Just give me a grace I worship I just

1942
04:19:51,880 --> 04:19:53,880
See I knew I would have to fight this guy

1943
04:19:54,680 --> 04:19:56,680
Came in handy a little later

1944
04:19:57,000 --> 04:19:59,000
Don't let him get up here get along get out here

1945
04:20:00,280 --> 04:20:02,920
Oh, do you fall off that'd be great actually

Bye-bye. See you. See you. Have a good night. Have a good time

1964
04:22:33,640 --> 04:22:41,240
Magic resistant. Yeah, that's why that's why I I'm really probably

1965
04:22:43,320 --> 04:22:48,920
Just gonna use try to get bleed bead build up on her. In fact, let me just like to hand it

1966
04:22:50,120 --> 04:22:52,620
That's not what I wanted to do hands

1967
04:23:03,800 --> 04:23:05,800
I

1968
04:23:10,120 --> 04:23:12,120
Really just panic rolling

1969
04:23:18,520 --> 04:23:21,880
What I didn't accidentally do that. All right, you know what?

1970
04:23:25,240 --> 04:23:28,040
I'm gonna make tears put it in work and I'm not really doing anything

1971
04:23:28,040 --> 04:23:39,400
What the hell she just totally dodged that I don't why I don't know why it's not let me chew hands

1972
04:23:51,400 --> 04:23:55,000
Oh, yeah, water I don't have any lightning stuff though

1973
04:23:58,760 --> 04:24:01,960
I did whole triangle in r1 and it's having me do this

1974
04:24:06,280 --> 04:24:09,880
It was weird I fixed it what's down here

1975
04:24:12,120 --> 04:24:14,280
Hello, oh that's where it came from

1976
04:24:18,280 --> 04:24:20,280
All right

1979
04:24:27,240 --> 04:24:32,120
I'm gonna bleed build you up baby girl. How much did I level?

1980
04:24:34,600 --> 04:24:38,600
I didn't level this at all. I would be a heavy load if I did that anyways

1981
04:24:57,240 --> 04:25:01,240
No, she's even resisted a lot

1982
04:25:04,200 --> 04:25:06,200
No, you backed out her

1983
04:25:06,200 --> 04:25:08,200
I can't

1984
04:25:24,600 --> 04:25:26,600
Can't even break her boys

1985
04:25:36,520 --> 04:25:38,520
Oh

1986
04:25:40,040 --> 04:25:45,880
I I can't beat her because I need a better weapon. I'm actually gonna come back to her. I need a better weapon

1987
04:25:46,840 --> 04:25:48,440
That's not

1988
04:25:48,440 --> 04:25:50,440
the moon veil

1989
04:25:57,000 --> 04:26:02,440
She leaps in the shape of a crescent moon. Oh, that's actually pretty funny. All right

1990
04:26:02,440 --> 04:26:09,720
I'm actually quite tired. So I'm gonna end the stream here, but I'm gonna come back

1991
04:26:11,160 --> 04:26:13,720
And why did I unplug that and I am

1992
04:26:15,080 --> 04:26:17,400
Gonna find another weapon

1993
04:26:19,160 --> 04:26:21,720
I'll be honest. I might play a little of this by myself

1994
04:26:22,120 --> 04:26:27,720
I won't do like any of the major bosses, but I'll do um, I'm just probably gonna go like

1995
04:26:28,680 --> 04:26:33,000
Digger out of stuff by myself because it'll hard for me to not play this off stream

1996
04:26:35,880 --> 04:26:39,080
Yeah, yeah, I might do some like farming stuff

1997
04:26:40,200 --> 04:26:41,400
Um

1998
04:26:41,400 --> 04:26:48,440
But thank you for hanging out with me. Thank you for you know, we could be be chill and just hang and just chat and have a good time

1999
04:26:49,400 --> 04:26:53,640
Um, see we did one hour and then three hours of game

2000
04:26:53,640 --> 04:27:00,680
Aren't you happy and we beat a boss. We beat the dragon that I'm in the lion. Boomie. You look like something in your ear

2001
04:27:01,160 --> 04:27:02,920
um

2002
04:27:02,920 --> 04:27:05,480
Have fun with the mogwin ledge. What does that mean?

2009
04:27:26,520 --> 04:27:29,960

04:28:09,080 --> 04:28:11,080
Are any of the girls streaming? No, okay

2018
04:28:11,080 --> 04:28:13,080
I

2019
04:28:19,800 --> 04:28:24,200
Didn't know if I was going to stream today or not. Uh, okay, I'm gonna raid

2020
04:28:27,640 --> 04:28:29,640
Momo

04:28:34,760 --> 04:28:35,880
Okay

2023
04:28:35,880 --> 04:28:39,800
They just started wait, how long have they been streaming? They actually might be ending soon

2024
04:28:40,840 --> 04:28:45,720
Because they they've been streaming for as long as me just about hold on. Let me see

2027
04:28:55,160 --> 04:29:00,440
Because she just started like an hour ago. Whereas Momo has been starting like playing for like five hours. So

2028
04:29:01,080 --> 04:29:03,080
We'll do that

2029
04:29:04,040 --> 04:29:06,040

2030
04:29:06,440 --> 04:29:12,600
Um, please don't attack my mouse right now. I'm trying to do stuff. I always feel bad like reading someone and they're like about to end

2031
04:29:14,120 --> 04:29:19,240
Because like I always like want to stream longer with someone raids me. So it's like, you know, taking advantage of the raid

2032
04:29:26,360 --> 04:29:28,360

2047
04:30:30,040 --> 04:30:33,320
British accent. It will be reverb and echo. So

2048
04:30:35,080 --> 04:30:37,240
Yeah, um, it'll be

2049
04:30:38,520 --> 04:30:43,080
Well, it'll be I'll have to think of I'm still thinking of like the triggers and stuff

04:30:45,320 --> 04:30:46,360
I don't know

2051
04:30:46,360 --> 04:30:51,160
I'll figure it out. I won't be at most. I might just be a lot of whispering to be honest with you

2052
04:30:52,120 --> 04:30:53,640
and like

2053
04:30:53,720 --> 04:30:55,720
Probably like reading you bible stories

2054
04:30:57,960 --> 04:31:00,120
Um, but we'll see we'll see

2055
04:31:01,800 --> 04:31:06,680
Unless she be is some more I'll just put you in the book of genesis the entire time

2056
04:31:08,120 --> 04:31:13,080
Yeah, I'm gonna go eat and watch an episode of the last kingdom and then pass out

2057
04:31:15,320 --> 04:31:20,280
And also see if fia is hungry. She ate a lot this morning. So she's she's big chilling

2058
04:31:21,160 --> 04:31:24,280
Which bible stories? I don't know probably the most horrible ones

2059
04:31:25,640 --> 04:31:27,640
Like Sodom and Gomorrah

2060
04:31:29,320 --> 04:31:33,240
Um, but yeah, we'll see we'll see and then like I might just like again like role playing

2061
04:31:33,240 --> 04:31:36,680
Let's do a lot of like unintelligible whispers. I'll just speak in tongues at you
