uh an audio but not I don't know if I'll be able to get away with anything

02:06:40.800 --> 02:06:47.280
ooh alternative but um I don't think I will be in the mood to do that

02:06:52.800 --> 02:06:58.400
I was flying prena oh it was great it was amazing now I have to take off my shoes I didn't have to

02:06:58.400 --> 02:07:05.760
do that before um I also get really bad ear pain being on an airplane and that's why

02:07:06.480 --> 02:07:11.040
I don't like flying the last two the last place I traveled to you know yeah I drove

02:07:11.040 --> 02:07:14.640
I drove to Canada with friends that was fun you drove to Montreal

02:07:17.440 --> 02:07:21.760
and then I've driven to New York before with my parents

02:07:23.600 --> 02:07:26.160
yeah I also have to figure out I don't even know because like

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.480
I don't know I've asked my parents if they're gonna drive me to the airport

02:07:30.720 --> 02:07:36.960
I don't know I have to make sure my grandparents are my aunt because I have also

02:07:36.960 --> 02:07:40.720
have aunt and uncles they live down there so I'm gonna try to see

02:07:43.680 --> 02:07:51.120
firm yeah yeah TSA gets feet for free yeah I have I get really bad ear pain because one of

02:07:51.120 --> 02:07:54.240
my eustachian tubes is kind of sort of blocked because of my arthritis in my neck because of

02:07:54.240 --> 02:07:59.280
inflammation and all that other shit I've told you that before um so my ears really hurt so I'm

02:07:59.280 --> 02:08:06.640
gonna buy like a pack of gum hope for the best my mom has flown a lot she flew a lot for work um so

02:08:06.640 --> 02:08:12.880
she has a lot of she's already written me like a lot of advice um I it's so weird because I feel

02:08:12.880 --> 02:08:21.840
like a little kid again I feel like I am 16 15 again I forget how old I was flying to go see

02:08:21.840 --> 02:08:28.240
my grandparents and I was terrified back then and I'm terrified but they're older now they can't

02:08:28.240 --> 02:08:32.320
really fly so it's not it's better for me to travel rather than them

02:08:37.280 --> 02:08:42.000
hi I'm sorry I'm sorry I missed you guys too but you know like I'll tweet a bunch

02:08:42.960 --> 02:08:48.880
have shorts I have an ASMR I think I'm gonna do like a ear cleaning ASMR um

02:08:50.640 --> 02:08:56.080
I'm trying to think I might I'm debating whether or not to like pre-record like some

02:08:56.080 --> 02:09:02.400
Hades gameplay or something um just so you guys like have a video that goes up and it's me playing

02:09:02.400 --> 02:09:09.920
or maybe meet just like a totally different game um like I'll play something else like a

02:09:09.920 --> 02:09:15.840
do a little like pseudo playthrough style thing and just do a quick like one shot of something

02:09:15.840 --> 02:09:21.920
and have that up as well just so you guys don't get too lonely um I see you think of a game to play

02:09:21.920 --> 02:09:27.360
so if you have any suggestions let me know yeah don't worry it's I won't I don't leave for eight

02:09:27.360 --> 02:09:35.040
days I don't I don't leave till the 18th y'all that's all indie playthrough yeah don't worry I

02:09:35.040 --> 02:09:38.800
just want to tell you guys in advance I didn't want to come first talk to be like surprise I'm

02:09:38.800 --> 02:09:43.760
not gonna be around but it's like it's halfway through the week so you still it won't feel

02:09:43.760 --> 02:09:51.280
too much like a week I don't think because like I'm leaving on I think a Friday or Thursday and

02:09:51.280 --> 02:09:56.880
I'm coming back on a Tuesday so it's just like kind of you guys almost won't have me for like a

02:09:56.880 --> 02:10:08.560
weekend or something Hoonipop no I want to play Hoonipop on blue twitch with no sensors um but

02:10:08.560 --> 02:10:14.640
yeah I just didn't I don't want you guys to stress um I'll probably just be like tweeting from the

02:10:14.640 --> 02:10:18.400
plane just like screaming in my head like just maybe I'll have a twitter space and be talking to

02:10:18.400 --> 02:10:26.480
myself like a crazy person next to the I got a window seat on the way there but I'm in the middle

02:10:26.480 --> 02:10:34.000
on the way back which I'm gonna hate I hope I'm not sitting next to weird people because I will

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:39.600
try to outweard them so that I feel safer

02:10:40.560 --> 02:10:41.200
uh

02:10:45.200 --> 02:10:55.200
you know getting good credit how about what I missed something

02:10:58.880 --> 02:11:02.560
I understand why there's no advance if your child is just moving safely yeah me too

02:11:02.560 --> 02:11:08.880
I just hope like my worst I like again you know OCD you always like think of the worst so I'm just

02:11:08.960 --> 02:11:15.120
like the plane's gonna go down uh something about I'm gonna lose my luggage this is gonna happen

02:11:15.120 --> 02:11:21.680
this is gonna happen um so like my mind goes like a million miles an hour

02:11:28.080 --> 02:11:36.320
definitely gonna need to I'm gonna charge up my switch um so I can play it on the plane and stuff

02:11:39.040 --> 02:11:41.360
I also have my laptop I could bring my laptop with me

02:11:43.520 --> 02:11:47.200
but I don't have like a portable mic to plug in because then I would just like png

02:11:48.880 --> 02:11:56.080
like stream and be like hi grandparents um I love you I'm gonna be locked in my room

02:11:56.720 --> 02:12:03.360
at like 12 at night and if you hear screaming don't worry about it but my grandparents would

02:12:03.520 --> 02:12:09.040
be absolutely mortified if they heard me streaming because they are very christian

02:12:10.480 --> 02:12:12.960
and if they heard me swear I'd feel so bad

02:12:17.280 --> 02:12:21.680
if I could tell you the funny shit my my grandparents say because they're so christian

02:12:22.720 --> 02:12:23.760
I love them to death though

02:12:25.600 --> 02:12:28.800
reminds me of a lady going I've seen people talk about how they used to next to a hot person

02:12:28.800 --> 02:12:32.880
in an airplane so if I haven't had that her friend thought she doesn't know she's the hot person

02:12:32.880 --> 02:12:42.240
oh I hope I'm the hot person flight simulators help you yeah I like I'm not scared of flying

02:12:42.240 --> 02:12:46.560
I'm just scared of things out of my control like when I can't control a situation

02:12:47.520 --> 02:12:54.800
that it frightens me I prefer safety start one of those prayer circles they just exercise me

02:12:57.680 --> 02:13:01.520
how do they feel if they saw a sexy muppet um honestly I don't think they would worry about it

02:13:01.520 --> 02:13:05.280
that much because my grandparents really love them up it's like my grandmother especially

02:13:05.280 --> 02:13:13.440
I think they have like all the things on like DVD and uh they probably think be like oh this is

02:13:13.440 --> 02:13:16.640
like Miss Piggy or something and it has boobs I don't know

02:13:20.240 --> 02:13:23.440
man I need to ask you I'm going to the beach soon do you want me to keep my

02:13:24.240 --> 02:13:29.280
even in the water no you don't have to wear it if you don't have to wear it in the water

02:13:30.240 --> 02:13:35.040
um I'm not if it can you can wear it in the water then that's cool but like again um

02:13:36.400 --> 02:13:38.240
I don't want you to like break it or lose it

02:13:40.640 --> 02:13:44.640
just know that if you do it like tightly a market leaves this from me

02:13:45.520 --> 02:13:49.520
this is why you are dumb don't like to lose the control oh yeah that's a good point

02:13:49.520 --> 02:13:54.320
yeah I hate losing control I generally do if I can't control a situation I get very upset

02:13:54.320 --> 02:13:59.520
so where am I it's gonna be weird not having she be holding on to my leash

02:14:00.080 --> 02:14:05.120
yeah I'm passing the reins over to Strani so she'll be she's she's educated in that

02:14:06.400 --> 02:14:12.080
I've already handed over your keys to her uh to your cages so you'll be fine

02:14:13.280 --> 02:14:19.120
mercy will also be keeping an eye um on the hair members that are trapped in my cage

02:14:19.120 --> 02:14:24.320
because she is also knowledgeable at cages but don't worry you guys will be well loved

02:14:24.320 --> 02:14:34.240
and well taken care of make sure mercy feeds you don't worry um yeah I'm gonna miss my cat so much

02:14:34.240 --> 02:14:39.600
I remember my every time I see my grandmother she like makes fun of me because the last time I was

02:14:39.600 --> 02:14:46.240
there um and this is when I had um Reina and Solea Solea being Reina's sister before she passed away

02:14:46.960 --> 02:14:52.880
and I was there so I was I was staying with my grandparents for a month um but I left like

02:14:52.880 --> 02:14:58.000
I think like a couple days or a week early because I just miss Reina and Solea so much

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:02.640
so it's literally gonna be so hard for me to be away from all my cats it's I don't know

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:08.640
I don't know how people do it like often if I could travel with them I would

02:15:09.680 --> 02:15:12.640
I think the only cat that would be okay with traveling would be

02:15:13.600 --> 02:15:18.480
actually none of them Fia's been kind of scared lately for some reason every time I open the door

02:15:18.480 --> 02:15:21.680
she like runs and I'm like did someone like come into my apartment like a maintenance guy when

02:15:21.680 --> 02:15:25.040
I wasn't here again and like scare the shit out of my cat like why are she scared every time I open

02:15:25.040 --> 02:15:34.720
the door it's really weird um but otherwise I would say I would would have said Fia Reina actually

02:15:34.720 --> 02:15:40.000
might chill Reina will just like really hey what's up Reina's doing well she's healing up well I was

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:48.720
looking at her but um if I could show you guys the before and after of what her the gash on her

02:15:48.720 --> 02:15:56.080
fucking leg looked like um from her anal gland rupturing you guys would be absolutely horrified

02:15:56.080 --> 02:16:02.320
because it looked like she got shot right next to her booty cheek um but she it's literally uh

02:16:03.120 --> 02:16:07.680
scabbed over now it looks really good she's doing really well she's very I was recording

02:16:07.680 --> 02:16:15.200
video this morning of her playing I'll probably post it um she's been yeah she's sleeping on a chair

02:16:15.200 --> 02:16:19.200
I'm like turning around um and losing tracking because I'm looking at her she's across the room

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:24.800
um and then yeah boomy boomy's you know a menace as per usual nothing you're there

02:16:26.080 --> 02:16:30.240
cats are intuitive you know these moving countries are a little more than usual things

02:16:30.960 --> 02:16:33.520
happen yeah um

02:16:36.640 --> 02:16:40.400
yeah Reina I feel like Reina I'm really worried about Reina because Reina is definitely like

02:16:40.400 --> 02:16:47.600
imprinted on me um my voice is cracking a little bit because I'm sad talking about it um so I'm

02:16:47.600 --> 02:16:52.800
gonna miss her a lot because she's my cat but thankfully she also loves my mom a lot so but

02:16:52.800 --> 02:16:58.320
she sees my mom she's gonna be really happy um she loves hanging out with my mom when my mom came

02:16:58.320 --> 02:17:05.760
over last she uh she was like really excited to see her and it was it's funny how you like is my

02:17:05.760 --> 02:17:14.160
she hadn't seen Reina in like probably a couple months like quite like six months and my mom's

02:17:14.160 --> 02:17:18.160
like she's forgotten me and I'm like no she hasn't I've had her since she was a kid and she knows

02:17:18.160 --> 02:17:24.720
anywhere um but yeah she's really great she's healing my grandparents have pets no my grandparents

02:17:24.720 --> 02:17:29.200
have never had pets because they're the type of people that think animals are meant to be outside

02:17:29.200 --> 02:17:36.960
at all times um that was funny the first time my grandpa so these are my Haitian grandparents

02:17:37.600 --> 02:17:43.840
um so they they also have you know that that they have like Haitian accents um

02:17:45.600 --> 02:17:53.440
like my grandfather almost like it's more like a french accent and uh so back like I remember

02:17:53.440 --> 02:17:58.960
a couple years ago when my grandparents first saw Reina Reina used to be a really fat cat unless

02:17:58.960 --> 02:18:03.200
until she recently lost a lot of weight because of her age and she just can't like she used to be

02:18:03.200 --> 02:18:08.960
like like 17 pounds I'm not even kidding you we I will post pictures of when she was very large

02:18:11.120 --> 02:18:17.280
and so my grandfather saw her the first time she like walked out from like uh this is when I

02:18:17.280 --> 02:18:22.320
lived at my parents house and then she walked out from like behind a wall or something and my

02:18:22.320 --> 02:18:28.960
grandfather goes oh look at her she is pregnant wow she's what a beautiful cat you're gonna have

02:18:28.960 --> 02:18:39.920
beautiful kittens and I'm like poppy no she's not pregnant she's not pregnant

02:18:43.360 --> 02:18:48.000
yeah Reina was a thicker I still thick um I used to I used to I used to call her Miss Chonk

02:18:48.560 --> 02:18:52.240
she'll she'll always be fat to me even though she's like normal cat size now

02:18:52.960 --> 02:19:01.200
yeah he definitely fat shamed her um but yeah I haven't even told my grandparents like I quit

02:19:01.200 --> 02:19:06.960
my job yet so it's gonna be kind of awkward having that conversation my grandfather texted me yesterday

02:19:06.960 --> 02:19:13.600
he's like hey how's it going I can't wait blah blah blah and I'm just like it's going great I can't

02:19:13.600 --> 02:19:23.680
wait to see you soon because I know I like they are they're very traditional um

02:19:25.360 --> 02:19:29.920
like I know they were kind of upset that I didn't go to college because my grandfather was gonna

02:19:29.920 --> 02:19:35.200
pay for my college until but then I went a little um I took a gap year and then he didn't but yeah

02:19:35.200 --> 02:19:40.880
it's a whole fake thing um they don't know what I do now only my parents do and some and like two

02:19:40.880 --> 02:19:47.120
my two best friends all of in Salem have you guys uh I've mentioned to you often um my grandparents

02:19:47.120 --> 02:19:55.360
don't know my former employer knows because I was just like yeah fuck you guys I'm gonna go be a big

02:19:55.360 --> 02:20:05.520
streamer no I didn't say that uh they don't have old country value oh yeah um it's like boy or

02:20:05.520 --> 02:20:10.960
kettlebell that's cute yeah the oh they only want I never take it personally they only ever want

02:20:11.600 --> 02:20:17.920
what's best for me um if I told them anything that I did they'd probably be absolutely mortified

02:20:19.440 --> 02:20:26.720
I'd be like she's living in sin um yeah they won't be I'll probably skirt around the topic and be

02:20:26.720 --> 02:20:30.560
like oh you know like because I remember when I tweeted that tweet like oh what do I tell people

02:20:31.280 --> 02:20:39.680
that I do I'm just gonna be like I uh work for a startup social media company but I'm under

02:20:39.680 --> 02:20:44.720
NDA so I can't say anything and then they'll be like oh okay and I rather they won't like they

02:20:44.720 --> 02:20:54.000
won't usually when I'm there I make them talk a lot so uh probably Morgan

02:20:54.160 --> 02:21:04.560
okay I'll tell you one funny thing that my grandfather has said

02:21:06.160 --> 02:21:13.120
so my grandparents were here last they um they came why did they come for did I think

02:21:13.120 --> 02:21:17.200
they did they come from like one of my parents anniversaries or something and my mom flew

02:21:17.200 --> 02:21:22.480
them up as a surprise I think I think so I can't remember so I'm going and my grandparents were

02:21:22.560 --> 02:21:29.440
staying um with my with my family for about like a week week and a half or two weeks I can't really

02:21:29.440 --> 02:21:34.320
remember and so my grandfather's like oh I want to go get some and my grandfather's the type he's

02:21:34.320 --> 02:21:39.200
always like wear slacks he's always was like wearing a polo he's very well-dressed man he used to be

02:21:39.200 --> 02:21:49.760
a Spanish teacher in Haiti and um he uh so we're looking for pants for him and with my grandmother

02:21:49.760 --> 02:21:57.440
just me him and my grandmother and he's just like looking at all these like slacks and he's like

02:21:58.080 --> 02:22:04.560
why are all these pants so skinny what they're what is this these cockscrew pants they're

02:22:04.560 --> 02:22:13.520
trying to look at my back sides I cannot believe them it is the homosexuals they want to see my

02:22:13.520 --> 02:22:20.400
back sides and they want to grab my back side I'm like poppy no I don't think I don't think the

02:22:20.400 --> 02:22:31.120
gays want anything to do with you he's like you never know you never know what they want I'm like

02:22:31.120 --> 02:22:37.360
poppy please remind you like my my my grandparents don't know also that I'm pansexual either I'm not

02:22:37.360 --> 02:22:42.400
there's no need to tell like that's this person to me I don't they don't know but I think I think

02:22:42.480 --> 02:22:46.640
it would be very funny if I was just like I said right there and then I'm like you know

02:22:48.960 --> 02:22:50.720
it would have been funny yeah you like my accent

02:22:53.280 --> 02:22:58.000
yeah I'm like I don't think nobody wants to look and it's like and this and this happened later

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:01.680
because we went shopping and he brought it up later to my parents because my parents asked him

02:23:01.680 --> 02:23:05.280
when we had a lot of other family over because like my family's all over the place and we all

02:23:05.280 --> 02:23:10.720
like came to my parents house and and like my parents family friends from their church and stuff

02:23:11.600 --> 02:23:17.360
and my grandfather is telling the story of this really short pants that's really tight

02:23:17.920 --> 02:23:21.840
skinny pants like skinny jeans and stuff and like skinnier slacks like they're really like

02:23:22.960 --> 02:23:27.360
whatever I don't really know how what they're called um and he's telling it to the group

02:23:27.360 --> 02:23:32.880
as we're like at my parents house around the fire and my mom is just looking mortified

02:23:33.520 --> 02:23:38.400
she's trying not to laugh so hard because like my parents my parents don't like my parents a lot

02:23:38.400 --> 02:23:46.640
more lax but my grandparents are hardcore like values like traditional uh biblical values my

02:23:46.640 --> 02:23:53.200
parents a little bit more lax so my mom is just like like redacted redacted it's fine don't worry

02:23:53.200 --> 02:23:58.800
about it like you did I hope you found better pants anyways is anybody you want some uh potato

02:23:58.800 --> 02:24:00.160
salad is anybody

02:24:07.280 --> 02:24:11.360
I think my family has gotten worse this time to be these last liver when I was a kid

02:24:12.400 --> 02:24:16.080
oh I just take yeah my parents were a lot more conservative and now they just like really don't

02:24:16.080 --> 02:24:22.960
give a shit anymore um I don't really care either way I just I don't have the energy to hate

02:24:23.920 --> 02:24:26.800
that's not my problem I don't care um

02:24:29.120 --> 02:24:32.160
that's my grandparents my parents are chill my parents are chill

02:24:33.840 --> 02:24:38.160
my parents are very chill um they kind of just do their own thing

02:24:40.160 --> 02:24:45.520
my mom is the type of uh Christian woman where she

02:24:47.920 --> 02:24:50.560
she says oh as long as nobody's hurting anyone

02:24:51.440 --> 02:24:53.520
and people are just showing each other with love and respect

02:24:55.280 --> 02:24:57.120
um that's all she could ever ask for

02:25:00.720 --> 02:25:05.200
hating is too much effort for nothing exactly I just don't I just don't have the energy

02:25:05.840 --> 02:25:11.120
even like people like really disagree with me or like have a totally different world view I'm

02:25:11.120 --> 02:25:17.040
just like I don't care speaking of which if you don't follow my alt twitter I said to read

02:25:17.040 --> 02:25:21.200
and this is why I have this mindset is because of this book I read the four agreements um

02:25:22.640 --> 02:25:28.400
because I sometimes I get I used to get so caught up with what people thought of me

02:25:29.040 --> 02:25:36.240
and how they spoke to me and how they did this this and that and like that book helped me so much

02:25:36.240 --> 02:25:40.080
I highly recommend it um and it's it's written in such a

02:25:40.240 --> 02:25:47.200
like lazy way that it's like it sounds like you're just talking to someone and they're just like

02:25:47.920 --> 02:25:52.720
you know like you got to stop assuming stuff about people because when you assume it becomes

02:25:52.720 --> 02:25:58.560
miscommunications and like it's just it's just really funny how it's written um but I believe

02:25:58.560 --> 02:26:02.320
it's only like eight bucks off amazon it's a very good book

02:26:02.320 --> 02:26:11.920
I love doing that I like go XLRs like lit up very oddly whatever um

02:26:14.320 --> 02:26:20.480
but yeah yeah yeah it's a good book I remember and I'm not you know afraid to say this um when I

02:26:20.480 --> 02:26:29.440
was younger I was hospitalized because mental Illinois and um uh they had like flash cards of

02:26:29.440 --> 02:26:35.040
that and then and I always I always liked because they're like kind of just like affirmations you

02:26:35.040 --> 02:26:40.800
would say and just like what you could think about um to like kind of like improve and stuff

02:26:41.600 --> 02:26:45.760
and then when I left in like years and years and years had passed and I could never remember

02:26:45.760 --> 02:26:50.080
what it was called and then I walked into this random ass store and I saw the book and I was like

02:26:50.080 --> 02:26:57.120
holy shit and I immediately bought it and it's just it's just a good book when I was my young boy

02:26:58.080 --> 02:27:01.680
yeah it's just like uh I'm not usually like a self-help book person I think that's kind of

02:27:01.680 --> 02:27:07.440
bullshit but I gave it a try and I liked it um my mom's very much a self-help book person

02:27:09.360 --> 02:27:12.240
but I love that about her because then she always gives me good advice I'm like you can

02:27:12.240 --> 02:27:17.840
consume it and then you can just give it back to me in a easier to digest format um

02:27:17.840 --> 02:27:28.240
um I hate Illinois yeah I was like super young now I don't know what the fuck was going on um

02:27:28.240 --> 02:27:33.440
the subtle ardent oh yeah I think my mom has that book because my mom if I could show you just like

02:27:33.440 --> 02:27:42.000
that stack of books my mom has about self-help and nutrition because my mom loves good nutrition

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.480
um

02:27:47.920 --> 02:27:53.360
metallic Illinois yeah normally all everybody has a little dash in metallic in Illinois um

02:27:54.160 --> 02:27:58.320
yeah I always I'll always recommend you guys books that I think will help you or think that you

02:27:58.320 --> 02:28:04.480
might enjoy or I'll tell you if I think they're like silly like oh read this smut book just like

02:28:04.480 --> 02:28:12.640
how um how emi does uh I don't know mercy does mercy read I don't know I I know she reads I'm

02:28:12.640 --> 02:28:18.240
just wondering if she reads that type of book I can't recall I think she does make a little book club

02:28:20.800 --> 02:28:25.920
I know strongy reads a lot uh a lot of I can't remember if she reads all like nonfiction which

02:28:25.920 --> 02:28:30.720
surprised me because she like really loves lord of the rings I like how I'm talking about mercy

02:28:30.720 --> 02:28:36.640
and then right on my screen something she just says she tweeted something called just saying yes

02:28:36.640 --> 02:28:44.000
and that kind of freaked me out it was like she was talking to me um because I have everyone's

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:52.240
notifications turned on for all the girls um I'm looking forward to more recommendations yeah yeah

02:28:52.240 --> 02:28:57.840
I don't I'll probably yeah she likes this deck yeah she likes thrillers she likes thrillers she's in

02:28:57.840 --> 02:29:05.840
the walls um and I read a lot of high fantasy so I might uh I haven't read any thing in a while I'm

02:29:05.840 --> 02:29:11.280
reading that book um feather so vicious that emi recommended when she first tweeted about it

02:29:12.240 --> 02:29:16.080
because I like bullied her into telling me I was like what she's like I don't know if you can handle

02:29:16.080 --> 02:29:26.000
this I'm like girl I read cadence by Colleen Hoover and that is a that's that's a book for the

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:32.640
pin pals right there if I have any pin pals in the chat read cadence um all I'm gonna say is

02:29:35.120 --> 02:29:36.160
cousins and an uncle

02:29:39.520 --> 02:29:45.200
Lord Colleen Hoover is a menace fact I like Verity oh I think I might recommend Verity

02:29:45.760 --> 02:29:50.960
to no she's like she's not she's not a super good author I'm not even I'm not saying she's a good

02:29:50.960 --> 02:29:57.440
author by the way she I'm not saying that it's like if you just want to like read something silly

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:07.120
calling Hoover Hoover Hoover whatever the frick her name is is your girl um I think she would

02:30:07.120 --> 02:30:12.400
like I think Mercy would like Verity because it is a mystery it's like a what happened to this man's

02:30:12.400 --> 02:30:18.240
wife is the main character going crazy who I should also recommend the silent patient to Mercy but

02:30:18.240 --> 02:30:23.200
I bet she's already read that I love I love recommending books to people it's one of my favorites

02:30:24.640 --> 02:30:32.160
oh I feel like fantasy I read it was the speaker spear wielder trilogy oh I've never heard of that

02:30:33.520 --> 02:30:39.280
my dad has been harassing me to read the third binding which is pretty much literally

02:30:41.680 --> 02:30:47.680
the king killer chronicles in a different font um I like for I read like an audio I listened to

02:30:47.680 --> 02:30:52.480
the audiobook for the first two chapters and I hated the audiobook reader that I just stopped

02:30:52.480 --> 02:31:00.480
reading it um I think it's so funny when this person says hey they're beautiful babe and then

02:31:00.480 --> 02:31:09.040
people in the chat respond to it okay you're all beautiful babes I just I've always thought that

02:31:09.040 --> 02:31:13.360
was funny when that happened a book recommendation would be right before your vacay kind of a book

02:31:13.440 --> 02:31:17.680
report stream after your vacay no I would be traumatized never say book report to me again oh

02:31:17.680 --> 02:31:22.880
my god this shit I had to go through because it's funny I like to read a lot but I hated doing

02:31:23.600 --> 02:31:29.520
what was assigned to me during school for book reports and stuff it was my least favorite thing

02:31:29.520 --> 02:31:35.520
and like but I ended up like in hindsight I wish I had kind of focused more in the classics because

02:31:35.520 --> 02:31:39.520
you know you read like Huckbury Finn while that shit and like Catcher in the Rye I kind of want

02:31:39.520 --> 02:31:43.920
to go back and try to read those books again um because I didn't really I kind of just sped read

02:31:43.920 --> 02:31:52.480
through them here's home school just can't relate uh explains a lot okay right a five page essay as

02:31:52.480 --> 02:31:58.320
if you guys can tell me what to do that's funny that you think you can do that it's very cute um

02:31:59.440 --> 02:32:05.440
but I liked I like don't get me wrong I liked English class when I could write any sort of

02:32:05.440 --> 02:32:09.840
fiction that's why I really love my creative writing class um

02:32:14.400 --> 02:32:18.960
I'm I just thought I was I'm debating whether or not to try to find my old email or I save stuff

02:32:20.240 --> 02:32:24.720
and do a quick dramatic reading for you of one of my old post-by-post role plays

02:32:28.080 --> 02:32:28.880
actually I kind of want to

02:32:28.880 --> 02:32:30.880
uh

02:32:33.680 --> 02:32:36.880
wait is my ipad charged because I'd rather read it off of my ipad

02:32:58.880 --> 02:33:08.880
um

02:33:17.120 --> 02:33:21.440
my cats love to scare me by going under the bed and jumping out at my feet

02:33:22.400 --> 02:33:24.320
they are the monsters under my bed as my cats

02:33:24.480 --> 02:33:32.480
they say when you pass on a new best old judge your old role play logs

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:37.040
sometimes they speak to your stupid questions it's not as up what does it mean I don't know

02:33:37.040 --> 02:33:38.160
it's fucking morning bro

02:33:40.640 --> 02:33:42.160
facts

02:33:47.280 --> 02:33:48.560
I am plugged in

02:33:49.360 --> 02:33:54.400
I don't care about voice messages what is happening

02:33:58.560 --> 02:34:00.880
it's like automatically open twitter um

02:34:03.360 --> 02:34:06.880
where is my email I have to it'll take me a moment to search

02:34:12.560 --> 02:34:16.800
oh wait did someone someone don't know earlier by the way I thought I heard something but I

02:34:16.800 --> 02:34:20.560
couldn't tell if it was the game or not let me look to see if we got any donos or stupas

02:34:21.440 --> 02:34:22.640
thank you if you did by the way

02:34:31.760 --> 02:34:32.800
nope okay cool

02:34:42.800 --> 02:34:46.560
math can't be English and English is a math in terms of many right answers yeah there's

02:34:46.640 --> 02:34:47.040
always

02:34:50.400 --> 02:34:58.480
yeah math is more absolute uh I preferred English because it was you could be very ambiguous

02:34:58.480 --> 02:35:01.040
because I'm very much like a dreamer type person

02:35:02.560 --> 02:35:03.600
let me take the headphones off

02:35:08.640 --> 02:35:14.560
okay let me see let me see if I just type in creative writing if anything pops up

02:35:17.120 --> 02:35:17.620
okay

02:35:23.280 --> 02:35:24.400
oh yep

02:35:27.520 --> 02:35:29.840
what the fuck is about what is this

02:35:35.680 --> 02:35:39.760
oh I remember I wrote about like a serial killer really briefly

02:35:47.440 --> 02:35:53.680
okay I wrote this when I was like 17 you guys want to hear it

02:35:56.240 --> 02:35:57.200
you guys want to hear it

02:36:06.480 --> 02:36:09.600
oh my god hi rena she just like hopped on my lap as I was about to start

02:36:13.040 --> 02:36:13.840
teenage writing

02:36:16.720 --> 02:36:23.120
I'm gonna read this in a British accent

02:36:27.040 --> 02:36:33.840
I hadn't meant to do it but now I have to deal with the fact that there is a dead body in

02:36:33.840 --> 02:36:40.480
the waiting room if anyone comes in I'm screwed completely absolutely ultimately screwed

02:36:41.600 --> 02:36:45.600
this is terrible I was just going to enjoy myself this week no slip-ups

02:36:46.160 --> 02:36:51.120
I was going to be normal no senseless killing I had found so much for that

02:36:52.880 --> 02:36:56.400
my head jerks to the side as I hear shoes scuffle on the tile floors and feet away

02:36:57.040 --> 02:37:01.440
that's not good I'm running out of time my eyes glance around the cliche waiting room

02:37:01.440 --> 02:37:05.360
a room dappled with dying house plants and pictures of smiling children they're equally

02:37:05.360 --> 02:37:11.120
happy parents oh look over there that one's a puppy I cock my head and smile blissfully at

02:37:11.120 --> 02:37:16.960
the splatter of scarlet that had found its way to the framed picture my smile wavered as a nurse

02:37:16.960 --> 02:37:21.840
entered the waiting area quicker than I anticipated a clipboard in hand she was still unaware of the

02:37:21.840 --> 02:37:29.920
fellow lying motionless on the floor in a monotone voice called out Mr. Halliday weekend I'm sorry I

02:37:29.920 --> 02:37:36.160
have to cut you off there I'll spare you the gory details but she did fall voicelessly to the floor

02:37:36.160 --> 02:37:43.040
with uh maybe a pen in her neck if she was lucky enough to survive it no doubt the seizure she's

02:37:43.040 --> 02:37:46.320
having would render the brain damage she wouldn't remember me anytime soon

02:37:49.680 --> 02:37:54.160
my ring is licking my hand and I'm trying to read what are you doing lady can you sit down

02:37:56.720 --> 02:38:03.520
um I straightened my suit jacket also read for occasions such as these inside the clipboard

02:38:03.600 --> 02:38:08.000
was covered in the nurse's blood but I could clearly still see one of my aliases in thick

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:14.080
black ink more in Halliday I like the name very much and it frustrated me now that I would have

02:38:14.080 --> 02:38:18.560
to scrap it and get it yet another one false identities weren't particularly cheap these

02:38:18.560 --> 02:38:24.240
days either and thinking of this caused a scowl to cross my face speaking of which I should probably

02:38:24.240 --> 02:38:30.320
take care of my face I like how I switched from British to normal it's fine no doubt it was flecked

02:38:30.320 --> 02:38:35.280
in my favorite color I walked hastily to the nearby bathroom the smell of sterility somewhat

02:38:35.280 --> 02:38:41.200
dizzying even for a person like myself one who enjoys cleanliness in order ironically with a

02:38:41.200 --> 02:38:45.520
quick gesture I opened the door and looked in the mirror and the same hazel oh see we're gonna get into

02:38:45.520 --> 02:38:54.640
the uh the description part by the same hazel eyes same dark brown hair the same clean shaven face

02:38:55.280 --> 02:39:00.400
even the blood dotted across it was a comforting familiarity my hand promptly reached for the

02:39:00.400 --> 02:39:05.440
soap while its companion slumped simultaneously turned on the water and I scrubbed earnestly

02:39:05.440 --> 02:39:10.400
thinking over my options what could I do with the two bodies bleeding out before someone will

02:39:10.400 --> 02:39:14.320
check back eventually and I need at least 20 minutes to get my supplies in one hour to clean

02:39:14.320 --> 02:39:19.360
everything up in another two hours to destroy your heart the bodies my lips form a thin line

02:39:19.360 --> 02:39:25.520
want to stare into the mirror a little longer and think back I pictured the room more specifically

02:39:25.520 --> 02:39:32.080
the corners thankfully I didn't remember any cameras I really have to have to have to take time

02:39:32.080 --> 02:39:37.440
to erase video files and probably kill a security guard I knew DNA wasn't a problem anymore for me

02:39:37.440 --> 02:39:43.200
I had to get to match it to a face as plain as mine I didn't have any memorable scars on my face

02:39:43.200 --> 02:39:49.600
only my body but that's another story again I didn't I probably watched like one true crime

02:39:49.600 --> 02:40:00.400
episode before I broke this um let me get us to the audiobook series um I rubbed my hands vigorously

02:40:00.400 --> 02:40:05.360
with an absurd amount of paper towels before sorry this is really small font so sorry me to read

02:40:05.360 --> 02:40:09.680
we're shoving them in a fatally small trash can and letting myself out of the bathroom

02:40:10.640 --> 02:40:13.760
my head peeked around a few corners and it looks like no one had come through yet

02:40:14.400 --> 02:40:18.000
I stood in the doorway of the waiting room checking my person for any signs that I had

02:40:18.720 --> 02:40:23.120
dispatched people and found nothing incriminating besides something I could blame on a nosebleed

02:40:25.040 --> 02:40:28.400
excuse me but the satisfied nod I opened the door to leave the

02:40:28.400 --> 02:40:31.360
waiting room completely with a sort of flourish and fed it away

02:40:31.840 --> 02:40:42.320
you're probably wondering who I am thinking why would someone sorry why would a person commit

02:40:42.320 --> 02:40:49.680
something so morbid may I plead insanity not that I've ever said that none of us hello nice to

02:40:49.680 --> 02:40:55.680
meet you my name is Nolan Nolan Aristar you've probably heard of me why the f*** I'm so f***ing

02:40:55.760 --> 02:40:56.480
pretentious

02:41:02.400 --> 02:41:09.360
I'm like reading this and I feel like I sound like um Heisenberg from f***ing village

02:41:10.240 --> 02:41:13.200
oh also called the piercer

02:41:14.880 --> 02:41:17.360
well I'm cementing the venom from my immortal

02:41:17.440 --> 02:41:25.760
oh it's funny I wrote this before I was diagnosed with OCD you'll see why

02:41:33.120 --> 02:41:37.200
pardon me also called the piercer pretty nifty if I do say myself giving my

02:41:37.200 --> 02:41:41.600
given my middle name is pierce but I don't think the cops who christened me knew that

02:41:42.320 --> 02:41:45.840
anyways drifting from the original topic you're wondering why I've done this but

02:41:45.840 --> 02:41:49.680
sincerely sincerely I cannot tell you I tell you I cannot help it

02:41:50.240 --> 02:41:58.240
you see I like the color red very much blood is clearly red in its purest form and I need

02:41:58.240 --> 02:42:05.120
no eye crave to look at it touch and feel it this is all thanks to my obsessive compulsive

02:42:05.120 --> 02:42:11.040
disorder commonly known as the abbreviation OCD this is nothing to do with OCD but it's funny

02:42:11.040 --> 02:42:17.680
that I wrote this I'd like to stop I really would but red is just really my favorite color

02:42:18.480 --> 02:42:25.360
it calms me it's beautiful I won't say it's art because that's so typical I strange myself from

02:42:25.360 --> 02:42:33.040
other killers because honestly the majority of them kill for art corpses aren't majestical masterpieces

02:42:33.040 --> 02:42:37.920
the human body's disgusting thing when twisted and deformed and truly when it's normal and you

02:42:37.920 --> 02:42:42.960
rot on the inside from corruption or some other adjective that's more poetic

02:42:45.120 --> 02:42:46.160
I'm not the OCD

02:42:48.480 --> 02:42:53.360
I'll cringe from time to time at my handiwork I'll get carried away lose myself and be very

02:42:53.360 --> 02:42:58.160
mad afterwards people need to understand how inconvenient killing a person is it's a time

02:42:58.160 --> 02:43:05.120
consuming and it's time I can't read my own fucking email and obviously you would get into

02:43:05.120 --> 02:43:11.280
a lot of trouble I have to take time out of my day to come and end your life which probably isn't

02:43:11.280 --> 02:43:17.040
all rainbows and sunshine and such a place is this you're welcome you selfish prick heart sign

02:43:17.040 --> 02:43:22.800
smiley face enough of me and my terrible explaining skills I just felt in the need to justify myself

02:43:22.800 --> 02:43:29.760
all right all right I literally wrote heart sign smiley face by the way

02:43:29.760 --> 02:43:37.680
I tossed my suit there's like like two more paragraphs I tossed my suit jacket

02:43:37.680 --> 02:43:42.800
on the couch when I entered my modest and modern apartment I'm pretty sure this inspired by like

02:43:42.800 --> 02:43:48.800
um it was inspired by like some true crime thing that I watched it was inspired by

02:43:48.800 --> 02:43:54.960
Marceline from Adventure Time because how she drinks the color red and I think it was

02:43:55.280 --> 02:43:58.480
inspired by like American Psycho

02:44:01.520 --> 02:44:09.920
like all those uh I also was just very aggressive person when I was younger um

02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:16.560
everything was just as I liked it monochrome with splashes of red I like how my that's kind

02:44:16.560 --> 02:44:22.960
of how my outfit is um it's monochrome with splashes of red bro I was I predicting my own

02:44:22.960 --> 02:44:27.600
am I gonna kill no I'm kidding um the only colors I can tolerate besides red are the

02:44:27.600 --> 02:44:32.720
usual black and white colors that I am indifferent to only apples lay in the bowl on the island in

02:44:32.720 --> 02:44:37.440
the kitchen only tomatoes were in a jar on the counter besides the sink not that everything I

02:44:37.440 --> 02:44:43.200
eat is red that would be probably unhealthy and ridiculous I do have my limitations however you'll

02:44:43.200 --> 02:44:50.800
find nothing orange ever anywhere in here never orange is an unsightly color that should just

02:44:51.520 --> 02:44:58.560
go home it tries too hard to be red I don't know how some people enjoy orange juice too really

02:45:01.600 --> 02:45:08.960
orange is an unsightly thing I know uh yeah I actually I do hate the color orange

02:45:13.120 --> 02:45:14.800
orange is my least favorite color

02:45:15.760 --> 02:45:21.360
so I threw some shots at orange right now but I do love orange juice so that's a lie

02:45:23.920 --> 02:45:28.880
uh I do a little jig as I head toward the bathroom peeling off clothes as I near it

02:45:28.880 --> 02:45:32.880
when I reach the shower I'm already completely undressed feverishly rubbing away the sense of

02:45:32.880 --> 02:45:37.680
metal with some cinnamon soap cinnamon masks anything I'll tell you that right now I turn

02:45:37.680 --> 02:45:42.480
my head slightly as I hear a thump somewhere from within the house confused I shut off the water

02:45:42.480 --> 02:45:47.040
and toweled myself off before stepping out of the shower I'm not an idiot and I don't call out

02:45:47.040 --> 02:45:51.600
who's there like a stereotypical girl in a horror movie but wrap the towel around my waist

02:45:52.400 --> 02:45:56.800
wait already like oh no I didn't I just toweled myself well he toweled himself off

02:45:58.400 --> 02:46:02.880
uh and wait for the sound to occur again and soon enough a moment later it does

02:46:02.880 --> 02:46:06.320
I sigh with relief as it's not coming from within my apartment but outside the door

02:46:06.960 --> 02:46:10.000
someone's knocking feel there she's this one

02:46:11.600 --> 02:46:15.120
the memsie is this story so Dracula's kill who's that

02:46:17.360 --> 02:46:23.200
Amy hate what do you mean Amy hate confirm is she like orange she's a ginger I don't

02:46:23.200 --> 02:46:28.000
know this only applies to like the color like if it's on like it doesn't apply to ginger hair

02:46:28.640 --> 02:46:32.240
because on Emmys I've already said Emmys model is my favorite out of everyone's

02:46:32.720 --> 02:46:37.600
and then it goes like mercy me

02:46:40.640 --> 02:46:44.800
actually no that's hard it'd be hard to rank all the girls models

02:46:47.040 --> 02:46:50.480
and me mercy me

02:46:52.480 --> 02:46:57.920
fuck because I genuinely like I like mercies and strongies even evenly um hold on

02:46:57.920 --> 02:47:07.920
I didn't put the connection together

02:47:13.200 --> 02:47:17.840
I meander down the Honeiro hallway somewhat lazily and finally peer through the people

02:47:17.840 --> 02:47:25.120
just my like my luck my like on the other side it's not like I have I wrote this in great grammar

02:47:25.120 --> 02:47:30.240
I just can't read right now on the other side is an eye trying to look through causing me to

02:47:30.240 --> 02:47:36.720
flinch back when I look again very cautiously I see the smug look of a grizzly grizzly looking cop

02:47:36.720 --> 02:47:41.040
he's leaning forward to knock again before I can swiftly unlock and open the door

02:47:42.240 --> 02:47:46.720
before he can I swiftly unlock and open the door letting the cop swing at an open air then

02:47:46.720 --> 02:47:53.280
smack me in the chest just what I wanted I let out a small squeal hey I just opened the door

02:47:53.360 --> 02:48:00.480
might you hit me the cop was clearly flustered after this hitting a groan very fit I might add

02:48:00.480 --> 02:48:06.960
man in a towel and took a step back oh or accident sir sorry about that this won't take long I'm

02:48:06.960 --> 02:48:12.160
just here to ask a few questions he looked down at his shoes and pulled out a notepad and flipped

02:48:12.160 --> 02:48:17.440
a few pages I knew it wouldn't take much to make this guy go away but still this had to be the fastest

02:48:17.440 --> 02:48:21.920
time they spread word about clint killings it's been at least an hour and they've already brought

02:48:21.920 --> 02:48:29.040
their search radius to my house wincing at this I leaned against the doorway trying trying

02:48:32.640 --> 02:48:40.000
oh trying to look as huffy yet sexy as possible fire away pardon the pun I smiled widely pretending

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:46.320
to be happy the man was there my eagerness was an easy repellent uh well are you aware that they

02:48:46.320 --> 02:48:56.800
have been dual killings in the area and that's it that's how it ends I remember my classmates

02:48:56.800 --> 02:49:02.960
were like what for what happens next didn't his he just ultra instinct the door open fast enough

02:49:02.960 --> 02:49:07.680
to get knocked in the chest well I guess if you like linger and you're like lingering your hand

02:49:07.680 --> 02:49:14.720
they just opens it and just fucking knocks them yeah the cliffhanger let me see let me see creative

02:49:14.720 --> 02:49:18.720
writing did you do

02:49:19.440 --> 02:49:31.760
am I have to go like all the way back

02:49:31.840 --> 02:49:34.800
so

02:49:41.920 --> 02:49:44.800
the fuck was I writing Jesus Christ

02:49:57.040 --> 02:49:58.800
what the fuck is this

02:50:02.240 --> 02:50:10.800
oh this is some of my OCs

02:50:18.720 --> 02:50:27.360
interesting sorry this is like I don't remember writing this I'm not reading that no

02:50:27.600 --> 02:50:30.880
I don't want you guys to figure out how crazy I am

02:50:35.680 --> 02:50:41.920
is that like again when I said when I joked and said that no it's not it's not one of those

02:50:41.920 --> 02:50:43.760
it's wait is it one of those I didn't really

02:50:48.640 --> 02:50:49.200
it was like

02:50:50.160 --> 02:50:56.320
again as an only child I didn't have any fucking friends okay

02:51:01.040 --> 02:51:04.960
what if you compared my creative writing to my immortal well look at

02:51:04.960 --> 02:51:09.760
what I just read to you and then what I've read in my immortal it is not the same

02:51:11.040 --> 02:51:16.640
peer pressure or so the wolf roleplay tweet I was trying to find the wolf roleplay one

02:51:16.640 --> 02:51:20.160
because I remember I did like a dramatic writing of my character's death

02:51:20.160 --> 02:51:24.960
and I love roleplay I don't know where that is though it's not showing up

02:51:29.520 --> 02:51:31.760
I love how I left notes in the

02:51:31.760 --> 02:51:48.080
like I like a couple years ago more than a couple years ago like like two decades ago

02:51:48.080 --> 02:51:56.000
back when I was like 30 um I wrote like notes of like I must have reread it after like a year

02:51:56.000 --> 02:51:58.640
and then a year after that and I was just like what the fuck is wrong with me

02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:06.800
yeah my morals my my my magnum opus

02:52:11.440 --> 02:52:16.320
my morals are really scary I mean a lot of it showed up for the kj somewhere

02:52:16.320 --> 02:52:20.160
yesterday I think we're somewhere but no like like I was very

02:52:20.720 --> 02:52:26.080
like it isn't bad like it honestly it's a normal totally normal

02:52:27.360 --> 02:52:32.560
like I wrote like a chapter of something but it's the context behind it which makes me embarrassed

02:52:33.680 --> 02:52:40.720
because I wrote like I have this I've told you guys I lose to dream a lot right in fact I lose to

02:52:40.720 --> 02:52:46.000
dreams um when I woke up from my nap I was losing dreaming it was really weird um

02:52:46.160 --> 02:52:56.240
dreams have always been really weird for me because for me when I lose to dream I usually

02:52:56.240 --> 02:53:06.080
visualize a place and then there's like a hub after I lose to dream and it's I always end

02:53:06.080 --> 02:53:11.520
up there there's always like a hub and then I can like I sound so it sounds fucking crazy

02:53:11.520 --> 02:53:19.280
saying it out loud because it is it's just weird weird mind shit um but then I can go to like there's

02:53:19.280 --> 02:53:29.920
always like there's always places in my dreams that are like always constant is how I can

02:53:31.600 --> 02:53:37.520
say it like I don't like there's always like there's um there's I usually just call it like the hub

02:53:37.520 --> 02:53:41.520
which is like all the places you can go to and it's like usually there's like a pool

02:53:42.960 --> 02:53:46.880
you go into and I call it the gate and then there's this place called the train tracks because

02:53:46.880 --> 02:53:50.000
there's this train tracks and then there was the mall and it was like there's a banded mall

02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:54.320
whoop I just smacked my microphone and then there was like weirdly like my grandparents house

02:53:55.280 --> 02:53:59.120
my other grandparents house my mom's there and there's like a bunch of other places and there

02:53:59.120 --> 02:54:05.760
were there were always constant in my dreams um so I would go from place to place and I would

02:54:05.760 --> 02:54:12.080
find other places to add to like the hub very weird I don't know why my dreams do that like this

02:54:12.080 --> 02:54:19.040
the dream that I woke up from today um because I hadn't lucid dreamed in a very long time uh

02:54:21.040 --> 02:54:28.640
it was like I remember being outside my body and just or I'm usually I'm usually I've already said

02:54:28.640 --> 02:54:32.720
this before in dreams too I'm usually not myself in my dreams I usually have like a bird's eye

02:54:32.720 --> 02:54:36.640
perspective it's usually like I'm watching a movie or like watching something take place

02:54:37.520 --> 02:54:41.760
but this time I was myself and I was outside my body seeing myself talk to like a group of people

02:54:41.760 --> 02:54:46.880
and I was talking to them and I'm like hey I'm sorry I haven't been back in a long time I haven't

02:54:46.880 --> 02:54:54.320
woken up in a while and I was just and then I woke up and I was like what the fuck it was just

02:54:54.320 --> 02:55:05.280
fucking weird no not that hub you fuckers um yeah it's just my dreams are very vivid and weird um

02:55:06.400 --> 02:55:10.560
I made it that they start yet bro we ended like two hours ago I'm so sorry my the stream was at

02:55:12.080 --> 02:55:19.120
the stream was at six eastern time so we've heard you're three hours late I'm just talking about

02:55:19.200 --> 02:55:25.200
stuff now um I'm crying don't cry I wish I could lose the dream

02:55:26.160 --> 02:55:30.080
why do you have to ask your trips to blend to your sandy yeah so the context of this

02:55:30.960 --> 02:55:35.760
chapter that I'd written it was like a spin-off of like my dream lucid dream world because I've

02:55:35.760 --> 02:55:40.240
had this since I was like a little kid like a very little kid it's always been there's also this

02:55:40.240 --> 02:55:44.720
place called like the factory there's another play like it's really weird why my I don't know why

02:55:44.720 --> 02:55:52.240
my mind does that I'm like I don't have any fucking trauma that my mind would do that um maybe I'm

02:55:52.240 --> 02:55:57.760
just like the Lulu when I'm sleeping I don't know she'd be inception but literally though

02:55:57.760 --> 02:56:01.360
like I like that movie a lot because it's very it's very similar

02:56:05.200 --> 02:56:09.040
my dreams are absolutely mental and extremely specific and detailed at times yes like I have

02:56:09.040 --> 02:56:12.960
I literally have a I have a journal next to me where I used to write down my dreams pretty often

02:56:13.760 --> 02:56:16.000
because again a lot of my dreams I feel like would make really good books

02:56:18.960 --> 02:56:26.880
um because like I never elaborated on the crocodile dream that I had the other day I just

02:56:26.880 --> 02:56:33.680
said you saved me from a crocodile there was so much more than that uh we were like you know

02:56:33.680 --> 02:56:39.360
like old like trope and like writing that was like like maximum ride like the gifted on the run

02:56:39.360 --> 02:56:44.720
like we were like that it was like me and harem on the run because we all had superpowers and like

02:56:44.720 --> 02:56:48.640
there was one person that was chasing us that I think he turned into a crocodile and then we

02:56:48.640 --> 02:56:57.280
killed him and ate him I have I have batched fucking dreams um I remember talking to my one of

02:56:57.280 --> 02:57:00.720
my therapists one time and I'm like is there something wrong with me and she's like well you

02:57:00.720 --> 02:57:06.560
know your dreams are just you know your mind working out stuff when when you're asleep from

02:57:06.640 --> 02:57:12.640
what happened during the day and I'm like I don't think my mind does that because I never

02:57:12.640 --> 02:57:20.800
dream about the real world I like yeah how are we actually cool yeah you guys were cool

02:57:22.240 --> 02:57:28.800
I felt like I was in like a reverse harem atome game there's like a bunch of hot harem members

02:57:28.800 --> 02:57:32.320
around me and we're all like on the run with our superpowers I can't remember it's been too long

02:57:32.320 --> 02:57:35.120
for me to remember what the superpowers were but I think a lot of them are elemental

02:57:37.440 --> 02:57:42.080
I explain why I drew a vtuber right are we cool no you're not

02:57:45.120 --> 02:57:47.520
it's none of you cool you're only cool in my dreams I suppose

02:57:48.720 --> 02:57:50.640
I might have not been me if it was a hot member

02:57:54.240 --> 02:57:58.160
you have the drip no we were we were all like wearing the same outfit we were all in like

02:57:58.160 --> 02:58:05.760
jumpsuits like it was fucking like um uh I almost said bakugan what the fuck is it anime

02:58:06.720 --> 02:58:10.160
uh my hero academia

02:58:13.120 --> 02:58:16.400
it's a good game it almost kind of likes your game too um

02:58:17.440 --> 02:58:21.360
yeah and I remember we were like and then at one point we had to escape a jail

02:58:23.280 --> 02:58:26.560
um but it was really cool to like watch it because we were all like like my dreams are also

02:58:27.360 --> 02:58:31.680
the favorite character has arrived free and I go eat

02:58:33.520 --> 02:58:34.560
my cat's food is going off

02:58:38.480 --> 02:58:41.920
and then the other one will go off in like four minutes um

02:58:43.680 --> 02:58:52.880
but um yeah my it's like I'll never have like my cats and my dreams or my parents and my dreams

02:58:52.880 --> 02:58:56.080
it's very it's never I usually never dream about myself

02:58:57.520 --> 02:59:04.720
very odd hi Toma it's dinner time for the harem go get your food here to your dispensers going off

02:59:05.440 --> 02:59:11.040
it's Spencer my favorite streamer I know Strani and um I think somebody else that I was streaming with

02:59:11.680 --> 02:59:18.080
oh yeah I think it was like Poseidon and Apollo they were just like wow I love the addition of the

02:59:18.080 --> 02:59:25.360
cat food this thing I was like a really good character I was on the umibus I can't remember

02:59:28.640 --> 02:59:35.440
oh everybody's been very happy with your muppetizing um of Azura by the way

02:59:38.640 --> 02:59:41.920
you know how all faces and dreams are ones you see walking around day to day life

02:59:42.720 --> 02:59:46.720
I've heard that I have very yeah I see like and you know how like you're not supposed to be able to

02:59:46.720 --> 02:59:52.000
read in dreams I can read in dreams I don't I can read stuff it doesn't like get jumbled

02:59:53.360 --> 02:59:55.680
I can control stuff it's weird because like

02:59:57.520 --> 03:00:03.280
there's like there's a consistent pattern of like me being a god of like this fucking like a just a

03:00:03.280 --> 03:00:11.760
really toxic goddess of my dream realm so when people don't like react a certain way I like smite them

03:00:12.240 --> 03:00:22.400
you're a muppet fan art for me what is there a muppet was cute it's like big bird big bird here

03:00:25.040 --> 03:00:29.040
yeah I feel like yeah I was yeah I was really old testament

03:00:29.680 --> 03:00:31.120
chibi I'm not even joking

03:00:33.920 --> 03:00:37.760
he doesn't want it what do you mean she doesn't want it did she say she just want to be muppetized

03:00:38.000 --> 03:00:42.320
this is not like a dream to me yeah I was very

03:00:44.480 --> 03:00:51.200
I'm a very harsh god forced to reckon with in greek inter-egyptian mythology and it's it's

03:00:51.200 --> 03:00:56.800
interesting too because it's like again my dreams don't end they usually continue or

03:00:56.800 --> 03:01:02.240
consistent or it's like I'm the god looking at like another portion of my world or I'm like oh this

03:01:02.400 --> 03:01:07.120
weird shit's happening over here like I remember having like a

03:01:09.120 --> 03:01:16.880
a like horror related dream of like these people had like mutated this like monster thing and it

03:01:16.880 --> 03:01:22.320
escaped and it was literally like alien and I was just watching it take place but I wasn't scared

03:01:22.320 --> 03:01:27.200
because I'm like oh I'm not a part of this I'm just a god oh my god that bitch just died oh yeah

03:01:27.280 --> 03:01:30.560
she got yoinked she was dragged down a hallway by some like weird

03:01:31.120 --> 03:01:36.880

03:04:39.280 --> 03:04:43.200

03:04:45.920 --> 03:04:48.240

03:05:00.400 --> 03:05:01.520

03:05:06.480 --> 03:05:08.480
now I want to I need to listen to the background music

03:05:10.720 --> 03:05:14.240
I'm just gonna look up a karaoke video but I'm gonna keep it muted so this doesn't get

03:05:14.640 --> 03:05:17.360
claimed

03:05:28.800 --> 03:05:30.160
a little bit of body Tyler

03:05:40.720 --> 03:05:42.480

know if you can hate on me I like whatever I can't believe for anything okay

03:06:26.560 --> 03:06:27.600
why is this so quiet

03:06:34.640 --> 03:06:43.680
this is so I can't even hear it

03:06:56.640 --> 03:06:58.480
I'm so sorry I'm already choking

03:06:59.200 --> 03:07:04.720
I have to impress the girl I have to I just I have to be good I have to

03:07:05.600 --> 03:07:08.880
oh it's playing for my other headphones I'm so stupid

03:07:11.760 --> 03:07:17.040
you guys could probably hear it because I have my headphones hanging on my mic arm

03:07:17.680 --> 03:07:29.600
yeah

03:07:41.520 --> 03:07:44.560
maybe I should listen to the actual song because I can't remember what it sounds like

03:07:47.040 --> 03:07:49.600
I should just sing the strapped version

03:07:58.800 --> 03:08:03.600
yeah

03:08:03.920 --> 03:08:06.160
oh

Amy we missed you so much baby girl this is for you

03:08:12.720 --> 03:08:14.720

03:08:29.040 --> 03:08:29.760
they're gone

03:08:29.760 --> 03:08:34.760
Why am I high pitched?

03:08:34.760 --> 03:08:35.760
No!

03:08:35.760 --> 03:08:36.760
Was that?

03:08:36.760 --> 03:08:37.760
Whatever.

03:08:37.760 --> 03:08:38.760
It's a cute and funny cover.

03:08:38.760 --> 03:08:39.760
I don't know what I'm going to receive.

03:08:39.760 --> 03:08:40.760
By the toss and I turn and I dream of what I need.

03:08:40.760 --> 03:08:41.760
I need an Emmy.

03:08:41.760 --> 03:08:42.760
The Emmy goes to her Emmy till the end of the night.

03:08:42.760 --> 03:08:43.760
And she's gone.

03:08:43.760 --> 03:08:44.760
She's gone.

03:08:44.760 --> 03:08:45.760
She's gone.

03:08:45.760 --> 03:08:46.760
She's gone.

03:08:46.760 --> 03:08:47.760
She's gone.

03:08:47.760 --> 03:08:48.760
She's gone.

03:08:48.760 --> 03:08:49.760
She's gone.

03:08:49.760 --> 03:08:50.760
She's gone.

03:08:50.760 --> 03:08:51.760
She's gone.

03:08:51.760 --> 03:08:52.760
She's gone.

03:08:52.760 --> 03:09:12.760
I need an Emmy.

03:09:12.760 --> 03:09:13.760
I need an Emmy till the end of the night.

03:09:13.760 --> 03:09:14.760
And she's got to be strong, and she's got to be fast, and she's got to be fast, and she's got to be strong.

03:09:14.760 --> 03:09:16.760
I need an Emmy till the end of the night.

03:09:16.760 --> 03:09:18.760
I need an Emmy till the end of the night.

03:09:18.760 --> 03:09:19.760
And she's got to be strong, and she's got to be fast, and she's got to be fast.

03:09:19.760 --> 03:09:20.760
I need an Emmy till the end of the night.

03:09:20.760 --> 03:09:21.760
I need an Emmy till the end of the night.

03:09:21.760 --> 03:09:23.220
She's cute and small.

03:09:34.120 --> 03:09:36.600
Oh my God, I'm watching a lyric video, this isn't working out for me.

03:09:51.760 --> 03:09:53.760
I can't do this.

03:09:53.760 --> 03:09:57.760
I can't put it off my feet.

03:09:57.760 --> 03:10:00.760
I need an Emmy.

03:10:00.760 --> 03:10:01.760
I need an Emmy.

03:10:01.760 --> 03:10:02.760
Wait.

03:10:02.760 --> 03:10:04.760
I'm holding out for an Emmy till the end of the night.

03:10:04.760 --> 03:10:06.760
She's got to be stronger.

03:10:06.760 --> 03:10:07.760
She's got to be faster.

03:10:07.760 --> 03:10:10.760
She's got to be fresh from the fight.

03:10:10.760 --> 03:10:11.760
From her flight.

03:10:11.760 --> 03:10:13.760
Because she went on a trip.

03:10:13.760 --> 03:10:18.760
I'm holding out for an Emmy till the end of the night.

03:10:18.760 --> 03:10:20.760
It's my real voice.

03:10:20.760 --> 03:10:22.760
I don't know.

03:10:22.760 --> 03:10:24.760
I'm not even messing with the pitch.

03:10:24.760 --> 03:10:31.760
It's like doing it by itself.

03:10:31.760 --> 03:10:32.760
Okay.

03:10:32.760 --> 03:10:34.760
Let's start that.

03:10:34.760 --> 03:10:39.760
I don't know why hard tune is automatically making me high pitch.

03:10:39.760 --> 03:10:40.760
Oh my god.

03:10:40.760 --> 03:10:44.760
I wish you guys could hear the background music.

03:10:44.760 --> 03:10:45.760
Honey, she is cute.

03:10:45.760 --> 03:10:49.760
But you guys know I can do a cute and funny voice without the need of that.

03:10:49.760 --> 03:10:51.760
That's not a squeaky twig.

03:10:51.760 --> 03:10:53.760
I need a hero.

03:10:53.760 --> 03:10:56.760
I need a hero till the end of the night.

03:10:56.760 --> 03:10:58.760
Raina, stop chewing on my headphones.

03:10:58.760 --> 03:11:00.760
Stop it.

03:11:00.760 --> 03:11:02.760
And she's got to be strong.

03:11:02.760 --> 03:11:04.760
And she's got to be...

03:11:04.760 --> 03:11:06.760
It's cheering on my headphones.

03:11:06.760 --> 03:11:07.760
Raina, please.

03:11:07.760 --> 03:11:08.760
I'm begging you.

03:11:08.760 --> 03:11:09.760
Stop.

03:11:09.760 --> 03:11:10.760
Stop.

03:11:10.760 --> 03:11:12.760
Why are you purring?

03:11:12.760 --> 03:11:13.760
Let's go.

03:11:13.760 --> 03:11:16.760
She's just me out.

03:11:16.760 --> 03:11:19.760
She's like, hey.

03:11:19.760 --> 03:11:22.760
Okay, this pitch sounds more normal.

03:11:22.760 --> 03:11:26.760
Yeah, because this one I'm just voice acting.

03:11:26.760 --> 03:11:27.760
Wow.

03:11:27.760 --> 03:11:34.760
I need a hero.

03:11:34.760 --> 03:11:36.760
Are you continuing to sing into the thick of it?

03:11:36.760 --> 03:11:37.760
Oh yeah, earlier.

03:11:37.760 --> 03:11:39.760
Into the thick of it.

03:11:39.760 --> 03:11:41.760
Into the thick of it.

03:11:41.760 --> 03:11:44.760
Into the thick of it.

03:11:44.760 --> 03:11:45.760
Me.

03:11:45.760 --> 03:11:48.760
I'm marching through the woods.

03:11:48.760 --> 03:11:52.760
On and on we push.

03:11:52.760 --> 03:11:58.760
And we don't know where we're going.

03:11:58.760 --> 03:11:59.760
Into the thick of it.

03:11:59.760 --> 03:12:04.760
Oh, isn't that like a crap version of something?

03:12:04.760 --> 03:12:05.760
Great.

03:12:05.760 --> 03:12:10.760
I'm just going to start singing for the rest of the stream again because this is fun.

03:12:10.760 --> 03:12:12.760
No instrumentals.

03:12:12.760 --> 03:12:16.760
I'll probably do a karaoke stream when I come back though.

03:12:16.760 --> 03:12:20.760
I'm definitely going to do that.

03:12:20.760 --> 03:12:31.760
Only bangers today.

03:12:31.760 --> 03:12:35.760
I will sing you an actual song.

03:12:35.760 --> 03:12:37.760
I can't believe you called me Chibi.

03:12:37.760 --> 03:12:40.760
I'm really hurt.

03:12:40.760 --> 03:12:47.760
In the arms of an angel.

03:12:47.760 --> 03:12:57.760
In the arms of an angel.

03:12:57.760 --> 03:12:59.760
This was Chibi Chibi Boys.

03:12:59.760 --> 03:13:01.760
Ooh.

03:13:01.760 --> 03:13:06.760
People forgot that I was cute and funny before.

03:13:07.760 --> 03:13:10.760
Me out here waiting for that BBL Chibi cover.

03:13:10.760 --> 03:13:13.760
What would it be that?

03:13:13.760 --> 03:13:15.760
My anaconda don't.

03:13:15.760 --> 03:13:17.760
My anaconda don't.

03:13:17.760 --> 03:13:21.760
My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun.

03:13:21.760 --> 03:13:25.760
Boy toy named Troy used to live in Detroit.

03:13:25.760 --> 03:13:28.760
I don't know the rest of the song.

03:13:28.760 --> 03:13:31.760
Addiction to love Florence and the Machine.

03:13:31.760 --> 03:13:32.760
That's hard.

03:13:32.760 --> 03:13:36.760
I don't know if Florence and the Machine are kidding me.

03:13:36.760 --> 03:13:39.760
The perfect song to talk to you.

03:13:39.760 --> 03:13:42.760
I think I've done the whole, like,

03:13:42.760 --> 03:13:49.760
sort of mix a lot rap before.

03:13:49.760 --> 03:13:53.760
I thought you were going to go into doodle-bob with them.

03:13:53.760 --> 03:13:55.760
Oh, I'm annoyed.

03:13:55.760 --> 03:13:57.760
I'm annoyed.

03:13:57.760 --> 03:14:00.760
You're booming.

03:14:00.760 --> 03:14:02.760
What's that?

03:14:02.760 --> 03:14:04.760
What's that one song?

03:14:04.760 --> 03:14:06.760
Don't cry.

03:14:06.760 --> 03:14:08.760
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

03:14:08.760 --> 03:14:10.760
And now I want to sing you a song.

03:14:10.760 --> 03:14:12.760
And I'm going to sing you My Immortal.

03:14:12.760 --> 03:14:26.760
I'm so tired of being here.

03:14:26.760 --> 03:14:33.760
I'm depressed by all my childish fears.

03:14:33.760 --> 03:14:39.760
And if you have to leave, I wish that you'd just leave.

03:14:39.760 --> 03:14:41.760
I can't sing, by the way.

03:14:41.760 --> 03:14:44.760
Because your presence still lingers here.

03:14:44.760 --> 03:14:48.760
And it won't leave me alone.

03:14:48.760 --> 03:14:51.760
These wounds won't seem to heal.

03:14:51.760 --> 03:14:56.760
This plane is just too real.

03:14:56.760 --> 03:15:02.760
There's just too much that time cannot be erased.

03:15:02.760 --> 03:15:09.760
When you cry, I wipe away all of your tears.

03:15:09.760 --> 03:15:16.760
When you scream, I bite away all of your fears.

03:15:16.760 --> 03:15:22.760
And I held your hand through all these years.

03:15:22.760 --> 03:15:34.760
Where you still have all of me.

03:15:34.760 --> 03:15:40.760
That time could not erase.

03:15:40.760 --> 03:15:42.760
For Cease to sing beautifully?

03:15:42.760 --> 03:15:44.760
No, I don't think so.

03:15:44.760 --> 03:15:48.760
I wanted to get, like, actual singing lessons.

03:15:48.760 --> 03:15:50.760
My hand is a G.

03:15:50.760 --> 03:15:54.760
That's another...

03:15:54.760 --> 03:16:05.760
I'm going to do just Evanescence songs now.

03:16:05.760 --> 03:16:07.760
Is Bring Me to Life by Evanescence Emo?

03:16:07.760 --> 03:16:13.760
People also ask.

03:16:13.760 --> 03:16:17.760
Well, sometimes I can hear it, like, peek with my breath.

03:16:17.760 --> 03:16:21.760
Because it's trying to, like, filter them out.

03:16:21.760 --> 03:16:23.760
How can...

03:16:23.760 --> 03:16:25.760
Well, hold on.

03:16:25.760 --> 03:16:28.760
Take a drink of water.

03:16:28.760 --> 03:16:31.760
Wake me up! Wake me up inside!

03:16:31.760 --> 03:16:33.760
Can't wake up! Can't wake up!

03:16:33.760 --> 03:16:39.760
Save me! Save me from the nothing in the door!

03:16:39.760 --> 03:16:42.760
I love that cover, by the way.

03:16:42.760 --> 03:16:44.760
Um...

03:16:44.760 --> 03:17:02.760
How can you see into my eyes, like open doors?

03:17:02.760 --> 03:17:10.760
Leading you down into my core.

03:17:10.760 --> 03:17:14.760
Where I've become so numb.

03:17:14.760 --> 03:17:17.760
If I was, like, classically trained,

03:17:17.760 --> 03:17:21.760
I know I could be a really good singer, but I'm not.

03:17:21.760 --> 03:17:23.760
I also have the tendency...

03:17:23.760 --> 03:17:25.760
I usually sing, like, the person who is singing

03:17:25.760 --> 03:17:27.760
because of my ekolaleat.

03:17:27.760 --> 03:17:29.760
So, like, yeah.

03:17:29.760 --> 03:17:33.760
Wake me up! Wake me up inside!

03:17:33.760 --> 03:17:34.760
Yeah, I can't...

03:17:34.760 --> 03:17:36.760
I'm also not good with music in general.

03:17:36.760 --> 03:17:39.760
Like, I don't have perfect pitch or anything, so...

03:17:39.760 --> 03:17:41.760
This song hits so hard.

03:17:41.760 --> 03:17:43.760
When my dad is sad, he blasts Evanescence.

03:17:43.760 --> 03:17:45.760
Don't tell him I told you that.

03:17:49.760 --> 03:17:53.760
Just imagine coach in his car, he's blasting Evanescence.

03:17:57.760 --> 03:17:59.760
You're already a good singer?

03:17:59.760 --> 03:18:02.760
No, no, I need to, I need to, like, practice and train.

03:18:02.760 --> 03:18:04.760
But thank you, Amy.

03:18:04.760 --> 03:18:06.760
He's valid for that.

03:18:09.760 --> 03:18:12.760
It's the reverb, the reverb's helping me if I take it off.

03:18:20.760 --> 03:18:21.760
Am I arms?

03:18:21.760 --> 03:18:23.760
Forget it.

03:18:25.760 --> 03:18:27.760
Falsetto, you stick to rapping.

03:18:27.760 --> 03:18:30.760
It's like, I don't even know what my range is.

03:18:32.760 --> 03:18:34.760
It's like, I can sing pretty deeply

03:18:34.760 --> 03:18:37.760
because I'm more comfortable singing a lower note

03:18:40.760 --> 03:18:46.760
Like, I can sing, like, male song songs a little bit easier

03:18:46.760 --> 03:18:48.760
because I naturally have a deeper voice.

03:18:48.760 --> 03:18:50.760
But because I have a...

03:18:50.760 --> 03:18:52.760
Why? The voice strings, I can go really high.

03:18:52.760 --> 03:18:55.760
Or really low. I can, like, kind of adapt when needed.

03:18:56.760 --> 03:18:58.760
But yeah, I've been practicing a lot.

03:18:59.760 --> 03:19:05.760
So they really want to make sure that I do Stacey's mom some justice.

03:19:06.760 --> 03:19:09.760
My head voice is deeper than most people's chest voice.

03:19:09.760 --> 03:19:10.760
It makes it hard to sing.

03:19:10.760 --> 03:19:11.760
Oh, okay.

03:19:11.760 --> 03:19:13.760
Yeah, I know that does have a factor.

03:19:15.760 --> 03:19:18.760
Stacey, can I come over?

03:19:18.760 --> 03:19:21.760
After school, oh, oh, oh

03:19:22.760 --> 03:19:24.760
After, wait.

03:19:24.760 --> 03:19:26.760
After school

03:19:26.760 --> 03:19:28.760
We can hang around

03:19:28.760 --> 03:19:30.760
by the pu-pu-pu-poo

03:19:30.760 --> 03:19:32.760
Oh, oh, oh, oh

03:19:32.760 --> 03:19:34.760
Hang by the pool

03:19:35.760 --> 03:19:37.760
Did your mom get back

03:19:37.760 --> 03:19:39.760
from her business trip?

03:19:40.760 --> 03:19:42.760
Business trip

03:19:43.760 --> 03:19:44.760
Is she there?

03:19:44.760 --> 03:19:47.760
Or is she trying to give me the slip?

03:19:49.760 --> 03:19:51.760
Give me the slip

03:19:51.760 --> 03:19:53.760
You know I'm not the little girl

03:19:53.760 --> 03:19:55.760
that I used to be

03:19:55.760 --> 03:19:57.760
And since your dad walked out

03:19:57.760 --> 03:19:59.760
your mom could use a girl like me

03:20:01.760 --> 03:20:03.760
Stacey's mom

03:20:03.760 --> 03:20:04.760
because I can't go that high

03:20:04.760 --> 03:20:05.760
I can't belt

03:20:06.760 --> 03:20:09.760
Stacey's mom has got it

03:20:09.760 --> 03:20:11.760
That's why in my doing your mom cover

03:20:11.760 --> 03:20:13.760
it sounds like I'm like quiet

03:20:14.760 --> 03:20:16.760
Has got it going on

03:20:17.760 --> 03:20:19.760
She's all that I wanted

03:20:19.760 --> 03:20:21.760
I've waited for so long

03:20:21.760 --> 03:20:23.760
Stacey, can't you see

03:20:23.760 --> 03:20:25.760
you're just not the girl for me

03:20:25.760 --> 03:20:27.760
I know it might be wrong

03:20:27.760 --> 03:20:30.760
but I'm in love with Stacey's mom

03:20:31.760 --> 03:20:35.760
na na na na na na na na na na

03:20:35.760 --> 03:20:38.760
na na na na na na

03:20:41.760 --> 03:20:44.760
I love video kill the radio star

03:20:46.760 --> 03:20:48.760
ooh-wuh-ooh-wuh

03:20:48.760 --> 03:20:50.760
boom-boom-boom-boom-boom

03:20:50.760 --> 03:20:52.760
ooh-wuh-ooh-wuh

03:20:52.760 --> 03:20:55.760
boom-boom-boom-boom-boom-boom

03:20:57.760 --> 03:20:59.760
ah-tah-muh ah-ah

03:20:59.760 --> 03:21:07.460
Biddy, I'll kill the radio star. Biddy, I'll kill the radio star.

03:21:07.460 --> 03:21:15.060
In my mind and in my heart, something, something you've gone too far.

03:21:15.060 --> 03:21:17.560
Oh, uh, uh, uh, oh.

03:21:18.560 --> 03:21:21.560
Going for soup. Oh, yeah.

03:21:21.560 --> 03:21:31.060
I already made a joke of when I think, when I was first playing with the Go XLR, someone said 1985 and I was doing, what did I say?

03:21:31.060 --> 03:21:35.560
She be just hit the wall, she never had it all.

03:21:35.560 --> 03:21:39.560
One prozac a day, harem's kinda gay.

03:21:39.560 --> 03:21:43.560
Her dreams went out the door when she turned 54.

03:21:43.560 --> 03:21:47.560
Only then would no man, what happened to her plan?

03:21:47.560 --> 03:21:51.560
She was gonna be an actress, she was gonna be a star.

03:21:51.560 --> 03:22:00.560
She was gonna shake her ass on the hood of Yaku's car and her yellow SUV is now the enemy.

03:22:00.560 --> 03:22:23.560
All right, since Cinder, Nukstaku, waiting on Face Connect, there was Pixelink and Bishoujo, music still on YouTube music.

03:22:30.560 --> 03:22:36.560
I want to do parodies. I already have one parody in mind, but I'm not gonna tell you what it is.

03:22:36.560 --> 03:22:39.560
Because I have to, it's gonna take a lot to do it.

03:22:39.560 --> 03:22:45.560
Because I want to make a whole animated music video for it.

03:22:45.560 --> 03:22:50.560
I got your picture coming with you, dear Maria, count me in.

03:22:50.560 --> 03:22:55.560
There's a story at the bottom of this bottle and I'm the pen.

03:22:59.560 --> 03:23:01.560
I had you in the first one.

03:23:02.560 --> 03:23:14.560
Just eat it.

03:23:14.560 --> 03:23:19.560
You guys can see I'm also moving a lot.

03:23:19.560 --> 03:23:26.560
I need a 3D model so bad because you guys can't see how much I'm gesturing and dancing while I'm doing this.

03:23:32.560 --> 03:23:39.560
Honestly, like, stuck in the drive-thru is one of my favorite, like, jokie songs.

03:23:39.560 --> 03:23:44.560
Just eat it.

03:23:44.560 --> 03:23:47.560
How often do you get the mic?

03:23:47.560 --> 03:23:49.560
Sorry, we can tell.

03:23:49.560 --> 03:23:51.560
I know, I'm like, I'm swinging my hand.

03:23:51.560 --> 03:23:58.560
I'm like, I'm smacking my, what's the thing that suspends it?

03:23:58.560 --> 03:24:03.560
Oh, I need to fix the wires on it, though.

03:24:03.560 --> 03:24:05.560
There we go.

03:24:05.560 --> 03:24:10.560
Sometimes the wires slip.

03:24:10.560 --> 03:24:15.560
I don't remember whether to start something.

03:24:15.560 --> 03:24:17.560
I need a burp.

03:24:17.560 --> 03:24:22.560
No burps for you.

03:24:22.560 --> 03:24:27.560
They get muted.

03:24:28.560 --> 03:24:31.560
Check, yes, Juliet, are you with me?

03:24:31.560 --> 03:24:34.560
Rain is pouring down on the sidewalk.

03:24:34.560 --> 03:24:36.560
Sorry.

03:24:36.560 --> 03:24:39.560
Denied.

03:24:39.560 --> 03:24:41.560
Mambo number five.

03:24:41.560 --> 03:24:43.560
A little bit of straw knee in my life.

03:24:43.560 --> 03:24:47.560
A little bit, a little bit of mercy.

03:24:47.560 --> 03:24:55.560
It works because a lot of our names end in E, so that actually would work.

03:24:55.560 --> 03:24:58.560
A little bit of Zura in the sun.

03:24:58.560 --> 03:25:01.560
A little bit of Emmy all night long.

03:25:01.560 --> 03:25:08.560
A little bit of shivvy makes me your man, your woman, your woman, your Dom.

03:25:08.560 --> 03:25:16.560
Yeah, but then he does say Jessica, so you can say Azura because it's the same syllables.

03:25:16.560 --> 03:25:21.560
A little bit of icy going on.

03:25:21.560 --> 03:25:23.560
The snowberries are like, don't forget icy.

03:25:23.560 --> 03:25:26.560
Don't worry, I didn't forget icy.

03:25:26.560 --> 03:25:28.560
What's that one rap?

03:25:28.560 --> 03:25:38.560
Every time I see Icy's name, I think of that one rap by Saweetie.

03:25:38.560 --> 03:25:42.560
No, I don't want the Wikipedia page.

03:25:42.560 --> 03:25:44.560
Can't stop. Won't stop.

03:25:44.560 --> 03:25:45.560
Gikwap.

03:25:45.560 --> 03:25:46.560
Ten white toes in them.

03:25:46.560 --> 03:25:47.560
Tori.

03:25:47.560 --> 03:25:48.560
Flip flops.

03:25:48.560 --> 03:25:49.560
Many cures of pedicures.

03:25:49.560 --> 03:25:50.560
I'm always tip top.

03:25:50.560 --> 03:25:51.560
I'm not hot.

03:25:51.560 --> 03:25:53.560
All these lies need to stop because I'm icy.

03:25:53.560 --> 03:25:54.560
Wifey.

03:25:54.560 --> 03:25:55.560
Haters want to fight me.

03:25:55.560 --> 03:25:57.560
Never been the one to get a wrap up on a white tee.

03:25:57.560 --> 03:25:58.560
Keep my hands clean.

03:25:58.560 --> 03:25:59.560
Got some hitters moving shiesty.

03:25:59.560 --> 03:26:02.560
Asking if I'm rolling with some Gucci bitch I might be.

03:26:02.560 --> 03:26:03.560
It's very unlikely.

03:26:03.560 --> 03:26:05.560
My wrist looking icy.

03:26:05.560 --> 03:26:12.560
Charge it by the minute because my time is very pricey.

03:26:12.560 --> 03:26:15.560
Ain't no rest for the wicked.

03:26:15.560 --> 03:26:19.560
Money don't grow on trees.

03:26:19.560 --> 03:26:21.560
I like to, I am very good.

03:26:21.560 --> 03:26:25.560
I think I'm good at rapping.

03:26:25.560 --> 03:26:27.560
I used to do karaoke a little.

03:26:27.560 --> 03:26:32.560
I think I did like a whole like Childish Gambino karaoke and Tyler, Tyler the creator karaoke

03:26:32.560 --> 03:26:34.560
because they're my favorite rappers.

03:26:34.560 --> 03:26:37.560
I think I did, I think I did like a Kendrick one.

03:26:37.560 --> 03:26:41.560
But I was rapping bonfire and everybody was like losing their minds.

03:26:41.560 --> 03:26:45.560
It was so funny.

03:26:45.560 --> 03:26:47.560
You're very good.

03:26:47.560 --> 03:26:48.560
Thanks.

03:26:48.560 --> 03:26:49.560
All right.

03:26:49.560 --> 03:26:50.560
It's Childish Gambino.

03:26:50.560 --> 03:26:55.560
Homegirls drop it like the NASDAQ move white girls like there's coke up my ass crack.

03:26:55.560 --> 03:27:00.560
I just fucking love Childish Gambino's lyricism.

03:27:00.560 --> 03:27:02.560
Junior mom is an exemplary pretty good.

03:27:02.560 --> 03:27:03.560
Thank you.

03:27:03.560 --> 03:27:04.560
Appreciate it.

03:27:04.560 --> 03:27:14.560
Honestly, I will sing praises of mercy, however, because she did her whole song in one take

03:27:14.560 --> 03:27:16.560
because she thought she had to.

03:27:16.560 --> 03:27:18.560
She never recorded things before.

03:27:18.560 --> 03:27:19.560
Never recorded music.

03:27:19.560 --> 03:27:22.560
Neither have I, but I didn't think that she's just like one shot.

03:27:22.560 --> 03:27:24.560
She did that all in one fucking take.

03:27:24.560 --> 03:27:27.560
Can you believe that?

03:27:27.560 --> 03:27:32.560
My, my, my gen mates are so talented.

03:27:32.560 --> 03:27:34.560
Yeah, I love Mercy's cover.

03:27:34.560 --> 03:27:36.560
Like she's like, I don't like it.

03:27:36.560 --> 03:27:39.560
I'm like, this is freaking flames.

03:27:39.560 --> 03:27:41.560
Why don't you call 45 karaoke bar?

03:27:41.560 --> 03:27:43.560
Well, I think what was the last?

03:27:43.560 --> 03:27:52.560
When I first started at my job, my last job, which was almost six years ago for like a

03:27:52.560 --> 03:27:56.560
team building thing that took the new hires out to karaoke.

03:27:56.560 --> 03:28:00.560
And that was the first time I hung out with Olive and we sing.

03:28:00.560 --> 03:28:02.560
What are we saying together?

03:28:02.560 --> 03:28:04.560
We sang the Spice Girls.

03:28:04.560 --> 03:28:10.560
If you want to be my lover, that was really cute.

03:28:10.560 --> 03:28:12.560
I'll tell you what I want.

03:28:12.560 --> 03:28:13.560
I want to really, really want.

03:28:13.560 --> 03:28:14.560
So tell me what you want.

03:28:14.560 --> 03:28:15.560
What you really, really want.

03:28:15.560 --> 03:28:19.560
I want to, I want to, I want to, I want to, I want to really, really, really sing.

03:28:19.560 --> 03:28:24.560
If you want to be my lover, you got to get with my friends.

03:28:24.560 --> 03:28:26.560
They can last forever.

03:28:26.560 --> 03:28:28.560
Friendship never ends.

03:28:28.560 --> 03:28:30.560
If you want to be my lover.

03:28:30.560 --> 03:28:33.560
You guys can't see, but I'm really rocking.

03:28:33.560 --> 03:28:35.560
Yeah, it was really great.

03:28:35.560 --> 03:28:39.560
That literally was the beginning of our friendship to sing that together with her.

03:28:40.560 --> 03:28:42.560
Can't wait for me to be on their covers.

03:28:42.560 --> 03:28:43.560
Yes, I'm working on one.

03:28:43.560 --> 03:28:45.560
Do I need to work on one?

03:28:45.560 --> 03:28:47.560
Maybe I'll do that.

03:28:47.560 --> 03:28:51.560
When I come back, I don't want to over, overdo myself because I'm already going to work on

03:28:51.560 --> 03:28:55.560
probably a gameplay video and then an ASMR video.

03:28:55.560 --> 03:28:57.560
I don't really rock the Spice Girls.

03:28:57.560 --> 03:28:58.560
I'll dance however I want.

03:28:58.560 --> 03:29:03.560
I'm just waving my arms around and then I just end up really rocking.

03:29:03.560 --> 03:29:04.560
Ooh, a cover.

03:29:04.560 --> 03:29:05.560
Yeah.

03:29:05.560 --> 03:29:08.560
I want to, my next cover is going to be Stacey's mom.

03:29:08.560 --> 03:29:10.560
100%.

03:29:10.560 --> 03:29:14.560
Slay queen.

03:29:14.560 --> 03:29:18.560
And then Shawnee says I have to cover five bars, five seconds.

03:29:18.560 --> 03:29:20.560
So I will do that next.

03:29:20.560 --> 03:29:22.560
Because that'll be a funny short, actually.

03:29:22.560 --> 03:29:27.560
Actually, I think since I already technically did that in my Elden Drink stream or my Haiti stream,

03:29:27.560 --> 03:29:29.560
I can't remember which one it was.

03:29:29.560 --> 03:29:31.560
That should be clipped.

03:29:31.560 --> 03:29:33.560
Wait, I think someone did clip it.

03:29:33.560 --> 03:29:37.560
And I'm just going to package it down even more and then make it into a short in the scent

03:29:37.560 --> 03:29:39.560
of Shawnee because it'll make her day.

03:29:39.560 --> 03:29:41.560
Play all those arms queen.

03:29:41.560 --> 03:29:42.560
It's funny.

03:29:42.560 --> 03:29:46.560
I'm still learning how to pilot my model properly because I move my arms a lot,

03:29:46.560 --> 03:29:47.560
but I don't move my body.

03:29:47.560 --> 03:29:50.560
But I'm like, no, you got to move around.

03:29:50.560 --> 03:29:51.560
You got to bounce with it.

03:29:51.560 --> 03:29:52.560
You wouldn't rock with it.

03:29:52.560 --> 03:29:54.560
You wouldn't rock with it.

03:29:54.560 --> 03:29:56.560
Oh, I forgot to put my cover up on.

03:29:56.560 --> 03:29:58.560
Oh, frick.

03:29:58.560 --> 03:30:00.560
Shit.

03:30:00.560 --> 03:30:12.560
No.

03:30:12.560 --> 03:30:15.560
Sorry.

03:30:15.560 --> 03:30:23.560
No.

03:30:23.560 --> 03:30:24.560
What do you mean?

03:30:24.560 --> 03:30:29.560
No, I knew the entire time I had reverb and echo still on.

03:30:29.560 --> 03:30:32.560
I can't hear it in my headphones.

03:30:32.560 --> 03:30:57.560
That's all in song.

03:30:58.560 --> 03:30:59.560
It's great though.

03:30:59.560 --> 03:31:01.560
You know, it's a classic echo.

03:31:01.560 --> 03:31:03.560
Echo, echo, echo.

03:31:03.560 --> 03:31:05.560
I love a song too.

03:31:05.560 --> 03:31:06.560
I love that song.

03:31:06.560 --> 03:31:09.560
Thanks for hearing from Kingdom Hearts.

03:31:09.560 --> 03:31:13.560
Oh, it's great.

03:31:13.560 --> 03:31:18.560
I would just like have that song repeat and also simply and clean.

03:31:19.560 --> 03:31:26.560
I have like an essence stuck in my head so I can't bring off lyrics.

03:31:26.560 --> 03:31:34.560
Simple and clean.

03:31:34.560 --> 03:31:37.560
When you walk away.

03:31:37.560 --> 03:31:39.560
Wait, no.

03:31:39.560 --> 03:31:46.560
Take a deep breath for that one.

03:31:46.560 --> 03:31:47.560
I know.

03:31:47.560 --> 03:31:52.560
Sanctuary, in my opinion, is the best Kingdom Hearts song.

03:31:52.560 --> 03:32:05.560
When you walk away, you don't hear me say, please, oh baby, don't go simple and clean.

03:32:05.560 --> 03:32:07.560
I can hear myself peeking in my headphones.

03:32:07.560 --> 03:32:08.560
I don't like it.

03:32:08.560 --> 03:32:13.560
It's the way that you're breaking me feel tonight.

03:32:13.560 --> 03:32:18.560
It's hard to let it go.

03:32:18.560 --> 03:32:21.560
Yeah, something like that.

03:32:21.560 --> 03:32:34.560
Also, I really used to like Tommy Heavenly.

03:32:34.560 --> 03:32:47.560
Because I love Soul Eater as some of you may know.

03:32:47.560 --> 03:32:48.560
I'm not.

03:32:48.560 --> 03:32:52.560
Wait, where's the Romanji?

03:32:52.560 --> 03:32:53.560
Oh wait, Amelie covered that?

03:32:53.560 --> 03:32:55.560
I have to listen to that then.

03:32:55.560 --> 03:33:00.560
Because it popped up when I was typing Romanji.

03:33:00.560 --> 03:33:01.560
This is not Romanized.

03:33:01.560 --> 03:33:10.560
This is the same thing as before.

03:33:10.560 --> 03:33:14.560
My cats have the zoomies.

03:33:14.560 --> 03:33:15.560
Yes, Black Paper Moon.

03:33:15.560 --> 03:33:16.560
I'm late.

03:33:16.560 --> 03:33:17.560
Hi Nori.

03:33:17.560 --> 03:33:21.560
I'm just singing stuff.

03:33:21.560 --> 03:33:25.560
I'm fall.

03:33:25.560 --> 03:33:26.560
I'm fall.

03:33:26.560 --> 03:33:27.560
I'm fall.

03:33:27.560 --> 03:33:32.560
I can't hit notes, bro.

03:33:32.560 --> 03:33:43.560
I'm falling down into my shadow.

03:33:43.560 --> 03:33:45.560
I can also can't read Japanese.

03:33:45.560 --> 03:33:55.560
I'm falling down into my shadow.

03:33:55.560 --> 03:34:05.560
I'm falling down into my shadow.

03:34:05.560 --> 03:34:15.560
I'm falling down into my shadow.

03:34:15.560 --> 03:34:25.560
I'm falling down into my shadow.

03:34:25.560 --> 03:34:36.560
What's my cat doing?

03:34:36.560 --> 03:34:41.560
Raina, what are you doing?

03:34:41.560 --> 03:34:42.560
I'm not late.

03:34:42.560 --> 03:34:44.560
We're so up.

03:34:44.560 --> 03:34:45.560
I can't read Japanese.

03:34:45.560 --> 03:34:47.560
I can't read Romanji.

03:34:47.560 --> 03:34:48.560
Don't cry.

03:34:48.560 --> 03:34:49.560
Don't cry.

03:34:49.560 --> 03:34:50.560
Stop singing.

03:34:50.560 --> 03:34:51.560
Stop crying.

03:34:51.560 --> 03:35:02.560
I listen to a lot of Tommy Heavenly when I was younger in my weeb era and K-pop.

03:35:02.560 --> 03:35:05.560
What's that?

03:35:05.560 --> 03:35:06.560
Lucifer by SHINee.

03:35:06.560 --> 03:35:11.560
This is my favorite K-pop song.

03:35:11.560 --> 03:35:12.560
Lyrics.

03:35:12.560 --> 03:35:13.560
Romanize.

03:35:13.560 --> 03:35:18.560
I'm going to butcher some Korean.

03:35:18.560 --> 03:35:21.560
Wait, the ad popped up.

03:35:21.560 --> 03:35:22.560
I can't read this.

03:35:22.560 --> 03:35:24.560
Raina, what are you doing?

03:35:24.560 --> 03:35:26.560
You're like, I can hear you crashing stuff.

03:35:26.560 --> 03:35:28.560
Just lay down, lady.

03:35:28.560 --> 03:35:30.560
Rest in peace.

03:35:30.560 --> 03:35:33.560
By the way.

03:35:34.560 --> 03:35:36.560
Wait.

03:35:57.560 --> 03:35:59.560
I also used to know the dance.

03:35:59.560 --> 03:36:03.560
I used to know a lot of Korean choreography, K-pop choreography.

03:36:03.560 --> 03:36:06.560
Like rocking from team top.

03:36:06.560 --> 03:36:07.560
Team top.

03:36:07.560 --> 03:36:08.560
We don't make team top.

03:36:08.560 --> 03:36:09.560
Team top.

03:36:09.560 --> 03:36:11.560
We don't rock it, pop it, stop it.

03:36:21.560 --> 03:36:27.560
I'm going to show you the choreography for that for a quick second.

03:36:27.560 --> 03:36:30.560
She beat love by beats for cats to wreck the house too.

03:36:30.560 --> 03:36:33.560
She knocked over like...

03:36:33.560 --> 03:36:35.560
All my plants doing fine actually.

03:36:35.560 --> 03:36:36.560
She didn't knock it over.

03:36:36.560 --> 03:36:38.560
I think she just bumped it.

03:36:38.560 --> 03:36:39.560
Heading to bed.

03:36:39.560 --> 03:36:40.560
Have a good sleep.

03:36:40.560 --> 03:36:41.560
Sleep.

03:36:41.560 --> 03:36:42.560
Sleep.

03:36:42.560 --> 03:36:43.560
Sleep.

03:36:43.560 --> 03:36:45.560
Sleep and Eep.

03:36:45.560 --> 03:36:47.560
Um...

03:36:47.560 --> 03:36:51.560
I just think of Mickey Mouse.

03:36:51.560 --> 03:36:52.560
I just think of Mickey Mouse.

03:36:52.560 --> 03:36:53.560
I just think of Mickey Mouse.

03:36:53.560 --> 03:36:54.560
I just think of Mickey Mouse.

03:36:54.560 --> 03:36:55.560
I just think of Mickey Mouse.

03:36:55.560 --> 03:36:56.560
What's up?

03:36:56.560 --> 03:36:59.560
Oh, something here.

03:37:04.560 --> 03:37:06.560
What are you doing?

03:37:06.560 --> 03:37:10.560
She just has her head buried in the crook of my elbow.

03:37:10.560 --> 03:37:13.560
Eating the Korean produce right now.

03:37:13.560 --> 03:37:16.560
I'm going to show you real...

03:37:16.560 --> 03:37:18.560
No, you can look it up.

03:37:18.560 --> 03:37:21.560
Look up team top rocking.

03:37:21.560 --> 03:37:24.560
The song used to go so hard.

03:37:24.560 --> 03:37:29.560
I used to be able to know the choreography team top.

03:37:29.560 --> 03:37:34.560
And to scroll in like the middle.

03:37:34.560 --> 03:37:38.560
Fucking ad bro.

03:37:38.560 --> 03:37:40.560
Yes, you'll see the Mickey.

03:37:40.560 --> 03:37:51.560
Sleep is slipping out.

03:37:51.560 --> 03:38:03.560
Such a bop.

03:38:03.560 --> 03:38:06.560
Yeah, I really like K-pop because of the urban influences in it.

03:38:06.560 --> 03:38:13.560
And it was like a combination of like Asian culture and urban culture.

03:38:13.560 --> 03:38:17.560
And I like literally just like start shuffling in this music video and it was so sick.

03:38:17.560 --> 03:38:21.560
So I had to learn it.

03:38:21.560 --> 03:38:26.560
And I preferred male choreography because they actually dance.

03:38:26.560 --> 03:38:28.560
The girls just like walked around all cutely.

03:38:28.560 --> 03:38:29.560
Actually, no, that's a lie.

03:38:29.560 --> 03:38:41.560
I did like electric shock from girls generation.

03:38:41.560 --> 03:38:51.560
It's a girls generation.

03:38:51.560 --> 03:38:56.560
No, it was by FX.

03:38:56.560 --> 03:38:59.560
E-E-E-E electric shock.

03:38:59.560 --> 03:39:01.560
Na na na na na na.

03:39:01.560 --> 03:39:03.560
Na na na na na na.

03:39:03.560 --> 03:39:10.560
E-E-E electric shock.

03:39:10.560 --> 03:39:15.560
That was a nice gauge for girls generation.

03:39:15.560 --> 03:39:17.560
Listening to new jeans around the home.

03:39:17.560 --> 03:39:19.560
He's got some questioning or friendship.

03:39:19.560 --> 03:39:21.560
New jeans is good.

03:39:21.560 --> 03:39:24.560
I don't really listen to a lot of Korean music anymore, though.

03:39:24.560 --> 03:39:30.560
I usually just listen to, I've been listening to a lot of Tyler.

03:39:30.560 --> 03:39:37.560
A lot of K-Tranota.

03:39:37.560 --> 03:39:42.560
I've been going through my old music and listening to it since I was listening to my self-indulgence the other day.

03:39:42.560 --> 03:39:45.560
I have a very wide taste of music.

03:39:45.560 --> 03:39:50.560
Very wide range, wide taste of music.

03:39:50.560 --> 03:40:01.560
And people talk about things they like will not have any clue what they're talking about as long as they're on my first date.

03:40:01.560 --> 03:40:06.560
Boomi, what are you doing?

03:40:06.560 --> 03:40:08.560
Boomi, are you Zoomin?

03:40:08.560 --> 03:40:22.560
Are you Metro Zoomin? Metro Boomin Zoomin?

03:40:22.560 --> 03:40:25.560
Why are you running everywhere?

03:40:26.560 --> 03:40:32.560
I'm just like jumping.

03:40:32.560 --> 03:40:40.560
Please don't chew on my wires. Thank you. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Woo!

03:40:40.560 --> 03:40:45.560
Why are you running? Why are you running?

03:40:45.560 --> 03:40:47.560
I have electric shock stuck in my head.

03:40:47.560 --> 03:40:54.560
Sorry, I got distracted by reading fanfiction, my own old class stuff, and then singing.

03:40:54.560 --> 03:40:57.560
I am so sorry.

03:40:57.560 --> 03:41:02.560
I am so sorry.

03:41:02.560 --> 03:41:05.560
I just get so distracted in the sidetracks.

03:41:05.560 --> 03:41:09.560
You never knew cats got Zoomies? Are you kidding me? Cats are Zoomie masters.

03:41:09.560 --> 03:41:11.560
You thought dogs were its cats, dude.

03:41:11.560 --> 03:41:13.560
Are you gonna leave?

03:41:13.560 --> 03:41:16.560
I don't know.

03:41:16.560 --> 03:41:18.560
Why am I streaming tomorrow? Hold on.

03:41:18.560 --> 03:41:23.560
I think I'm streaming. Why does my mic sound like it's cutting out?

03:41:23.560 --> 03:41:30.560
It's like really weird sounding because it's trying to filter my voice for whatever fucking reason.

03:41:30.560 --> 03:41:40.560
It's really kind of annoying. I wish I would stop doing that.

03:41:40.560 --> 03:41:54.560
And some of my singing was nice. Keywords, some, some.

03:41:54.560 --> 03:41:58.560
What does that do? I'm just pressing buttons on my goXLR wondering what the heck's going on.

03:41:58.560 --> 03:42:06.560
I mean, I'm like, why is the gate so high?

03:42:06.560 --> 03:42:14.560
That's why it's, I don't know why. Sometimes it like messes up stuff on purpose.

03:42:14.560 --> 03:42:22.560
That's my cat, Tokyo drifting if you didn't hear.

03:42:22.560 --> 03:42:26.560
I couldn't tell you which one it was though because they're all just standing and staring at each other like that one.

03:42:27.560 --> 03:42:30.560
Because it had fun.

03:42:48.560 --> 03:42:50.560
Can he drive? No, he can't.

03:42:56.560 --> 03:43:04.560
If you know how they live in Tokyo, if you've seen it and you need it and you know you have to go fast and furious.

03:43:04.560 --> 03:43:08.560
Drift, drift, drift, fast and furious.

03:43:08.560 --> 03:43:12.560
Drift, drift, drift.

03:43:12.560 --> 03:43:17.560
That song goes so hard. I want to watch Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift now.

03:43:17.560 --> 03:43:20.560
I haven't watched that in a long time.

03:43:26.560 --> 03:43:38.560
That's pretty clever.

03:43:38.560 --> 03:43:40.560
That was pretty clever.

03:43:40.560 --> 03:43:44.560
I listened to that song so much you triggered something in my brain.

03:43:44.560 --> 03:43:48.560
Fast and Furious is never the same after that.

03:43:48.560 --> 03:43:54.560
I haven't seen, I think the last movie I saw was like either Fast 5 or Fast 6.

03:43:54.560 --> 03:43:59.560
I heard that they're on the 11th movie now or it's in production.

03:43:59.560 --> 03:44:02.560
Thank you by the way, Morgan for the tip.

03:44:08.560 --> 03:44:10.560
The last one was like 4.

03:44:10.560 --> 03:44:16.560
Tokyo Drift was like not even a good one though.

03:44:16.560 --> 03:44:22.560
The text to speech didn't go off because I have my desktop audio muted.

03:44:22.560 --> 03:44:24.560
So don't worry.

03:44:24.560 --> 03:44:30.560
Because I didn't, when I was playing music earlier from when I was singing to Emmy, I didn't want to mess it up.

03:44:30.560 --> 03:44:34.560
And like it claimed or something.

03:44:34.560 --> 03:44:40.560
I get demonetized either way because of my tickle bitties.

03:44:40.560 --> 03:44:44.560
Oh, my neighbors don't hate me too much.

03:44:44.560 --> 03:44:50.560
I'm singing at the same level as my TV when I put it up.

03:44:50.560 --> 03:44:54.560
It's fine.

03:44:54.560 --> 03:44:56.560
Tokyo Drift was the third one.

03:44:56.560 --> 03:45:00.560
Honestly, the first, second, and third were good.

03:45:00.560 --> 03:45:04.560
Tokyo Drift wasn't good but soundtrack and scene were good.

03:45:04.560 --> 03:45:06.560
I agree with that.

03:45:06.560 --> 03:45:08.560
Hardcore.

03:45:08.560 --> 03:45:20.560
I put my BGM back up so we're not just like listening to weird silence in my AC lightly in the background.

03:45:20.560 --> 03:45:26.560
Wait, why weren't they allowed to film in Shibuya?

03:45:26.560 --> 03:45:32.560
I didn't know that.

03:45:32.560 --> 03:45:34.560
I honestly just wish the main character wasn't that dude.

03:45:34.560 --> 03:45:36.560
I wish it was Paul Walker.

03:45:36.560 --> 03:45:38.560
He just like randomly is in Japan for no reason.

03:45:38.560 --> 03:45:40.560
I feel like that would have been funny.

03:45:40.560 --> 03:45:44.560
It's like, uh, Brian, we heard about, what was his name?

03:45:44.560 --> 03:45:46.560
Wasn't it Ryan?

03:45:46.560 --> 03:45:48.560
We heard about something.

03:45:48.560 --> 03:45:50.560
Oh, Brian, that's what it was.

03:45:50.560 --> 03:45:54.560
Brian, we heard about something and we need you to go to Japan because you know about this stuff.

03:45:54.560 --> 03:45:58.560
Go.

03:45:58.560 --> 03:46:00.560
Oh, people are, oh, that's terrible actually.

03:46:00.560 --> 03:46:02.560
It wasn't safe.

03:46:02.560 --> 03:46:04.560
Oh my God.

03:46:04.560 --> 03:46:08.560
Damn.

03:46:08.560 --> 03:46:16.560
Oh, let me, let's look at my schedule because I said I was going to do that.

03:46:16.560 --> 03:46:28.560
Okay, so, yeah, we have Elden Ring tomorrow and then Elden Ring after that.

03:46:28.560 --> 03:46:32.560
Because we're getting to the DLC.

03:46:32.560 --> 03:46:34.560
I've been reading up on the DLC by the way.

03:46:34.560 --> 03:46:36.560
I don't care about spoilers and shit.

03:46:36.560 --> 03:46:40.560
I like to go into games like this prepared.

03:46:40.560 --> 03:46:48.560
And so I was watching like things you should do and like what levels you should be at and all that stuff.

03:46:48.560 --> 03:46:52.560
So the next two days are playing Elden Ring.

03:46:52.560 --> 03:46:54.560
And honestly, I don't think we already be redone.

03:46:54.560 --> 03:47:04.560
I still have to go and kill Godfree, which is going to take fucking forever.

03:47:04.560 --> 03:47:10.560
Do I have to kill his mirage self or do I have to actually kill him?

03:47:10.560 --> 03:47:14.560
Because in my game, I didn't even bother fighting him.

03:47:14.560 --> 03:47:22.560
I just killed his fake version and that was it.

03:47:22.560 --> 03:47:26.560
I never fought Horaloo.

03:47:26.560 --> 03:47:30.560
Yeah, I need to get Moog.

03:47:30.560 --> 03:47:32.560
Okay, okay, the mirage.

03:47:32.560 --> 03:47:34.560
Okay, cool, cool, cool.

03:47:34.560 --> 03:47:36.560
That's fine then.

03:47:36.560 --> 03:47:38.560
I have to kill Moog.

03:47:38.560 --> 03:47:42.560
And for that, I was looking up what Moog's week two and it's literally blood poison.

03:47:42.560 --> 03:47:46.560
Like anything that like procs after a long time like scarlet rot.

03:47:46.560 --> 03:47:50.560
I'm like, but the thing is he's like,

03:47:50.560 --> 03:47:56.560
he has resistance like 40% to like fire or like 80% to like fucking fire or something.

03:47:56.560 --> 03:48:02.560
And then like 40% to all the others or 20% to all the others to all the other elements.

03:48:02.560 --> 03:48:08.560
I think he's like 20 or 40 or 30% resistant to magic.

03:48:08.560 --> 03:48:12.560
So I'm wondering if I need to get another fucking weapon.

03:48:12.560 --> 03:48:16.560
Probably worth killing the last two sacred tears.

03:48:16.560 --> 03:48:20.560
That's a good point.

03:48:20.560 --> 03:48:24.560
I killed, I remember in my first playthrough, I killed Morgoth on the first try and I was really

03:48:24.560 --> 03:48:28.560
or like the, at least like the third try and I was like, what?

03:48:28.560 --> 03:48:34.560
That's because I was just spamming the black knife the entire time to get that like death blight.

03:48:34.560 --> 03:48:42.560
Yeah, I'm just wondering if it's going to be smart going into the Moog fight with the moon veil.

03:48:42.560 --> 03:48:44.560
I don't think so.

03:48:45.560 --> 03:48:47.560
Um.

03:48:49.560 --> 03:48:50.560
Oh, yeah.

03:48:50.560 --> 03:48:52.560
Okay.

03:48:52.560 --> 03:48:54.560
Yeah.

03:48:54.560 --> 03:49:02.560
And then we have on Saturday, which I'm really, really looking forward to is the rating VTubers designs.

03:49:02.560 --> 03:49:03.560
I can't wait.

03:49:03.560 --> 03:49:04.560
It's going to be fun.

03:49:04.560 --> 03:49:07.560
And then we have the May plus concert watch along on Sunday.

03:49:07.560 --> 03:49:12.560
And then before I leave on Thursday,

03:49:13.560 --> 03:49:15.560
a little sneak peek of my schedule ahead.

03:49:15.560 --> 03:49:21.560
We're doing the Twilight watch along on Monday the 15th.

03:49:21.560 --> 03:49:30.560
And unless I might change that because I have to bring Reina to the doctor that day too at 9am.

03:49:30.560 --> 03:49:33.560
So if everything's fine, then yes, it will continue.

03:49:33.560 --> 03:49:36.560
If it's not fine, I will keep you posted.

03:49:36.560 --> 03:49:40.560
And then I have a collab with Mercy on Tuesday.

03:49:40.560 --> 03:49:42.560
I convinced her to play Super Bunny Man with me.

03:49:42.560 --> 03:49:45.560
And I know we're going to have lots of fun and laugh at that.

03:49:45.560 --> 03:49:54.560
And then Wednesday before I go, I'm going to do an ASMR stream where I'm your big sister and I put makeup on you as torture.

03:49:54.560 --> 03:50:02.560
And then yeah, and then I'll be gone until I so technically I'm back.

03:50:03.560 --> 03:50:08.560
The 22nd or 23rd.

03:50:08.560 --> 03:50:09.560
I can't remember.

03:50:09.560 --> 03:50:11.560
I have to look at my flight.

03:50:13.560 --> 03:50:16.560
Can't remember if it's early or late.

03:50:18.560 --> 03:50:26.560
And then I might take like the 23rd just like off just so I can like get my bearings,

03:50:26.560 --> 03:50:31.560
but I might do a gorilla that day if I feel good enough.

03:50:32.560 --> 03:50:40.560
But yeah, I just want to keep you guys posted because you know, I like to keep you guys posted.

03:50:40.560 --> 03:50:41.560
Yeah, I'm going to doll you up.

03:50:41.560 --> 03:50:46.560
I'm going to like torture you and be like, I need to practice makeup makeup skills for like prom.

03:50:46.560 --> 03:50:48.560
So sit down and you guys can't move.

03:50:48.560 --> 03:50:52.560
And then I'm just going to like be doing a bunch of shit to you.

03:50:52.560 --> 03:50:53.560
Yeah, you're my baby doll.

03:50:53.560 --> 03:50:55.560
I'm going to start calling you baby doll.

03:50:55.560 --> 03:50:57.560
Hey, baby doll.

03:50:57.560 --> 03:50:59.560
Hello, honey.

03:50:59.560 --> 03:51:01.560
Hello, my baby doll.

03:51:01.560 --> 03:51:03.560
I can't wait to play with you and break you.

03:51:19.560 --> 03:51:21.560
Hey, God, I hear your phones.

03:51:24.560 --> 03:51:26.560
I mean, this little sister she views big sis.

03:51:26.560 --> 03:51:27.560
Exactly.

03:51:27.560 --> 03:51:28.560
Exactly.

03:51:29.560 --> 03:51:36.560
I am your, um, Oni.

03:51:36.560 --> 03:51:37.560
Oni?

03:51:37.560 --> 03:51:39.560
I forget the honor effect pronunciation.

03:51:39.560 --> 03:51:42.560
You guys know your Bible is acting up.

03:51:42.560 --> 03:51:45.560
You should probably smack it down.

03:51:47.560 --> 03:51:48.560
My hot woman.

03:51:48.560 --> 03:51:50.560
You can't keep doing this to me.

03:51:50.560 --> 03:51:51.560
I'm going to die.

03:51:52.560 --> 03:51:54.560
Oni, son.

03:51:54.560 --> 03:51:56.560
Oni, son.

03:51:57.560 --> 03:51:58.560
Well darn too.

03:51:58.560 --> 03:52:00.560
And I'll be your Oni-san.

03:52:00.560 --> 03:52:02.560
Emo-shi-mo-shi.

03:52:02.560 --> 03:52:03.560
I just think of that one tick.

03:52:03.560 --> 03:52:09.560
That girl who speaks like fluent Japanese when she does it all on a southern accent as a joke.

03:52:09.560 --> 03:52:12.560
Arigata gozaimasu.

03:52:12.560 --> 03:52:14.560
Itadakimasu.

03:52:14.560 --> 03:52:15.560
Sue.

03:52:15.560 --> 03:52:20.560
Shibine-chan.

03:52:25.560 --> 03:52:26.560
It sounded like Callie.

03:52:26.560 --> 03:52:28.560
I've gotten that before.

03:52:41.560 --> 03:52:44.560
If you don't come back speaking...

03:52:44.560 --> 03:52:46.560
I don't know what that means.

03:52:49.560 --> 03:52:51.560
Go-mana-sorry.

03:52:51.560 --> 03:52:53.560
That's one of my favorite like off-handed things.

03:52:56.560 --> 03:52:58.560
Yeah, I'm pretty accurate when I mimic you guys.

03:52:58.560 --> 03:53:00.560
Go-mana-sorry.

03:53:00.560 --> 03:53:01.560
Sorry.

03:53:01.560 --> 03:53:02.560
Am I Canadian?

03:53:03.560 --> 03:53:04.560
Sorry.

03:53:04.560 --> 03:53:05.560
Sorry.

03:53:05.560 --> 03:53:06.560
Off the bed.

03:53:06.560 --> 03:53:09.560
Thanks for watching your evening with my comedy and entertainment personality.

03:53:09.560 --> 03:53:10.560
Thank you.

03:53:10.560 --> 03:53:11.560
Have a good one.

03:53:11.560 --> 03:53:12.560
Thanks for stopping by.

03:53:13.560 --> 03:53:20.560
I always like, I think, I think I genuinely like seeing people from the other girls,

03:53:20.560 --> 03:53:24.560
um, whatchamacallits, uh, fanbases.

03:53:24.560 --> 03:53:27.560
And because I'm just like, I'm glad that you can also enjoy me too.

03:53:27.560 --> 03:53:29.560
Like I might not be your Oshi, but you're like, you're still like,

03:53:29.560 --> 03:53:32.560
when your Oshi's not on, you can just be like,

03:53:32.560 --> 03:53:34.560
you know what, I'm gonna hang out with my bro today.

03:53:37.560 --> 03:53:39.560
Okay, yeah, so that just continues.

03:53:39.560 --> 03:53:40.560
It never ends.

03:53:40.560 --> 03:53:41.560
It never ends.

03:53:43.560 --> 03:53:44.560
Got home from work.

03:53:44.560 --> 03:53:45.560
She's still straight.

03:53:45.560 --> 03:53:46.560
You guys know I never stop.

03:53:46.560 --> 03:53:49.560
Japanese and singing classes for madam.

03:53:51.560 --> 03:53:52.560
She be my bro-shi.

03:53:52.560 --> 03:53:55.560
I love bro-shi.

03:53:55.560 --> 03:53:57.560
That's actually awesome.

03:53:57.560 --> 03:53:58.560
I'll be your bro-shi.

03:54:05.560 --> 03:54:06.560
That's funny.

03:54:06.560 --> 03:54:08.560
I'll be your bro-shi.

03:54:09.560 --> 03:54:19.560
I like how the thing that I was initially doing,

03:54:19.560 --> 03:54:23.560
which is reading up my like personal writings when I was a teenager,

03:54:23.560 --> 03:54:25.560
I just never looked to find the one I want,

03:54:25.560 --> 03:54:30.560
because I wanted to show you the actual like wolf one that I have written

03:54:30.560 --> 03:54:33.560
about my Oshi Cassander.

03:54:33.560 --> 03:54:36.560
He was a beautiful white wolf.

03:54:37.560 --> 03:54:42.560
And he was killed by his own brother like Mufasa Scar style.

03:54:42.560 --> 03:54:44.560
Kami bro-shi.

03:54:46.560 --> 03:54:48.560
I was Cassander with a C.

03:54:50.560 --> 03:54:56.560
I would often get a lot of my names inspired by Greek mythology,

03:54:56.560 --> 03:54:57.560
or just Greek.

03:54:59.560 --> 03:55:04.560
Or even like William Shakespeare characters.

03:55:04.560 --> 03:55:06.560
Yeah, he got Mufasa.

03:55:08.560 --> 03:55:10.560
Wait, let me see if I can find it.

03:55:10.560 --> 03:55:12.560
I wonder if I just look up Cassander.

03:55:35.560 --> 03:55:37.560
No, that's not it.

03:56:01.560 --> 03:56:03.560
Nope, nope, nope.

03:56:05.560 --> 03:56:07.560
And maybe it wasn't, I didn't save it.

03:56:07.560 --> 03:56:08.560
That's a bummer.

03:56:22.560 --> 03:56:24.560
I thought it would have been underdraft.

03:56:25.560 --> 03:56:26.560
No.

03:56:27.560 --> 03:56:31.560
Arner, clary, not the water.

03:56:32.560 --> 03:56:33.560
Search the archive.

03:56:45.560 --> 03:56:46.560
RIP.

03:56:48.560 --> 03:56:50.560
Writing stream to make up for it?

03:56:50.560 --> 03:56:51.560
No, I'm not the same.

03:56:51.560 --> 03:56:54.560
Like actually, I was an okay writer when I was younger.

03:56:54.560 --> 03:56:57.560
I don't, I haven't written in such a long time.

03:56:57.560 --> 03:56:59.560
Like actively.

03:57:02.560 --> 03:57:08.560
Oh man, I must be lost on one of my old computers.

03:57:13.560 --> 03:57:15.560
Oh my god, Reyna.

03:57:16.560 --> 03:57:17.560
Relax, lady.

03:57:18.560 --> 03:57:21.560
You need to, oh my god.

03:57:21.560 --> 03:57:24.560
She just like threw herself on my desk.

03:57:27.560 --> 03:57:29.560
My god, woman.

03:57:32.560 --> 03:57:35.560
Creative writing memory stream.

03:57:39.560 --> 03:57:41.560
I mean, I'm sorry that she knows you're leaving, I know.

03:57:41.560 --> 03:57:45.560
I just don't want her to hurt herself because sometimes she just throws herself on my desk

03:57:45.560 --> 03:57:50.560
and then she trips over my go XLR and my keyboard and I'm like, no, lady.

03:57:52.560 --> 03:57:56.560
Yeah, Strani was telling me that you guys liked the script writing stream.

03:57:57.560 --> 03:58:03.560
I'm a little self-conscious about my writing, which is why I haven't written any of my own scripts yet.

03:58:07.560 --> 03:58:14.560
Ellie showed you what I wrote when I was much younger because I have the excuse to say I was much younger

03:58:14.560 --> 03:58:16.560
because it's that cringy.

03:58:20.560 --> 03:58:22.560
She lives with her cast, not the other way around.

03:58:27.560 --> 03:58:28.560
What?

03:58:29.560 --> 03:58:35.560
These rice cakes taste like TV static and I started barfing up 50 colds.

03:58:37.560 --> 03:58:41.560
I know, yeah, I was wondering if I should write my own script.

03:58:41.560 --> 03:58:48.560
I just don't like, I'm not, I don't, I write, I don't write scripts.

03:58:50.560 --> 03:58:53.560
Like I could probably write a story.

03:58:54.560 --> 03:59:02.560
Like I can write like amazing smut for you if you want of me and Harum or me and insert your name,

03:59:02.560 --> 03:59:04.560
like a fanfiction of us together.

03:59:04.560 --> 03:59:06.560
I can do that very easily.

03:59:06.560 --> 03:59:09.560
But like writing, I've never, did I write it?

03:59:09.560 --> 03:59:11.560
Did I write a script in theater class?

03:59:11.560 --> 03:59:14.560
I did like one theater class when I was younger.

03:59:14.560 --> 03:59:16.560
I can't remember if I wrote a script though.

03:59:16.560 --> 03:59:17.560
Might have.

03:59:18.560 --> 03:59:20.560
Haven't all jacked it out for you.

03:59:20.560 --> 03:59:21.560
Yeah.

03:59:21.560 --> 03:59:27.560
But it's like, but then I like, again, I've read like we have a script writer and then like

03:59:27.560 --> 03:59:35.560
Shrani's are in scripts and I've seen in fact, I have to record a script for Emmy for a special

03:59:35.560 --> 03:59:37.560
little treat that she wants to record together.

03:59:40.560 --> 03:59:46.560
But and like, I'm like, I think I could, it might not be as good, but it would just be like,

03:59:46.560 --> 03:59:47.560
at least a starting point.

03:59:47.560 --> 03:59:51.560
And then you guys could like, obviously like give me a critique and examples.

03:59:51.560 --> 03:59:58.560
So yeah, maybe when I come back, I want to do, in fact, I want to make my schedule right now for when I come back.

04:00:00.560 --> 04:00:02.560
Because I want to do Hades.

04:00:04.560 --> 04:00:06.560
Let's do Wednesday.

04:00:06.560 --> 04:00:08.560
We'll do because I usually do member Mondays.

04:00:08.560 --> 04:00:09.560
So we'll do Wednesday.

04:00:09.560 --> 04:00:11.560
I'll do the members stream.

04:00:16.560 --> 04:00:27.560
I'll do script writing.

04:00:27.560 --> 04:00:29.560
Remember stream.

04:00:29.560 --> 04:00:30.560
I want to play.

04:00:30.560 --> 04:00:33.560
I put the wrong time.

04:00:33.560 --> 04:00:34.560
Or p.m.

04:00:39.560 --> 04:00:43.560
I also have to make time to hang out with Tomo.

04:00:46.560 --> 04:00:50.560
Then I have a collab with DEMPA coming up.

04:00:50.560 --> 04:00:52.560
I have so much shit to do guys.

04:00:52.560 --> 04:00:54.560
I'm so busy.

04:00:54.560 --> 04:00:56.560
And then I still want it when I come back.

04:00:56.560 --> 04:01:02.560
I want to record my next two months of audios for Patreon.

04:01:02.560 --> 04:01:06.560
So I'm going to be a busy fucking bee, but I like it though.

04:01:06.560 --> 04:01:10.560
It keeps me busy because otherwise I just lay around and that's not fun.

04:01:11.560 --> 04:01:14.560
Let's see.

04:01:14.560 --> 04:01:17.560
I take Sundays off so I can work on other stuff.

04:01:17.560 --> 04:01:19.560
So I'm not going to do anything on Sunday.

04:01:22.560 --> 04:01:24.560
What day did I say with Tomo that I would hang out?

04:01:24.560 --> 04:01:26.560
Let me look at my camera.

04:01:29.560 --> 04:01:36.560
I just looked at Discord for the first time in a while and I'm laughing because Imi sent a meme.

04:01:37.560 --> 04:01:40.560
I said, I must be Sonic the way I'm hedging my hog.

04:01:42.560 --> 04:01:44.560
I fucking love her so much.

04:01:44.560 --> 04:01:47.560
Why is she so funny for no reason?

04:01:52.560 --> 04:01:55.560
Tomo are you still here about looking at the chat?

04:01:55.560 --> 04:01:57.560
No, I think she disappeared.

04:01:57.560 --> 04:01:59.560
I don't know if she's streaming or anything.

04:02:06.560 --> 04:02:08.560
I don't know.

04:02:15.560 --> 04:02:19.560
Okay, I might have to be the week after that I do want the Tomo because I don't.

04:02:19.560 --> 04:02:22.560
I don't think we actually sell alone a day.

04:02:27.560 --> 04:02:29.560
Okay, I'll do Hades on Thursday.

04:02:32.560 --> 04:02:34.560
Hades.

04:02:36.560 --> 04:02:38.560
Wait, no, I want to do the member stream.

04:02:38.560 --> 04:02:40.560
Discard.

04:02:40.560 --> 04:02:42.560
No, I want to do karaoke really bad for real.

04:02:50.560 --> 04:02:52.560
Should I do it?

04:02:52.560 --> 04:02:54.560
I'll ask you guys.

04:02:56.560 --> 04:03:03.560
If you and only if you're a member answer this question, would you prefer it be an archive?

04:03:03.560 --> 04:03:12.560
Because like what sucks about an unarchived karaoke member stream is that not all members might be able to see it.

04:03:16.560 --> 04:03:19.560
So I'm debating if that's a good idea.

04:03:26.560 --> 04:03:29.560
Because I don't want could always do a rebroadcast.

04:03:34.560 --> 04:03:37.560
Anyway, Patreon members could see no.

04:03:40.560 --> 04:03:43.560
There's Patreon content and there's YouTube content.

04:03:43.560 --> 04:03:46.560
They are two separate entities, but I appreciate if you support me on one.

04:03:46.560 --> 04:03:49.560
And if you can't support me on the other, that is fine.

04:03:51.560 --> 04:03:53.560
But also a girl got to eat.

04:03:56.560 --> 04:03:58.560
I just can't hit.

04:03:58.560 --> 04:04:06.560
Like there's also there has to be a reason why you want to become a member, you know, and it's for the fun, cool stuff, member stuff.

04:04:07.560 --> 04:04:10.560
Re-broadcasting, I don't know what that means.

04:04:11.560 --> 04:04:13.560
Oh, I'm getting cramps and it hurts.

04:04:28.560 --> 04:04:50.560
You just rebroadcast of the stream, but like stream you stream the unarchived pod.

04:04:52.560 --> 04:04:57.560
Oh, oh, okay.

04:04:58.560 --> 04:05:00.560
No, yeah, that's actually a good idea.

04:05:00.560 --> 04:05:01.560
That's what Narissa does.

04:05:01.560 --> 04:05:03.560
Okay, then I'm going to copy Narissa.

04:05:04.560 --> 04:05:07.560
That's smart because then I can just stream and record.

04:05:09.560 --> 04:05:12.560
I need to get a new SSD because I'm running out of space.

04:05:12.560 --> 04:05:19.560
I have like maybe 300 gigabytes left and I have like so many fucking because no, you know what I need to fucking do?

04:05:19.560 --> 04:05:22.560
I need an uninstall overwatch and fucking call of duty.

04:05:23.560 --> 04:05:28.560
That's what I needed to uninstall and save up like 600 gigabytes from that alone.

04:05:30.560 --> 04:05:32.560
The 1080, you mean my 1070?

04:05:36.560 --> 04:05:41.560
I like I'll probably I'll probably get a new PC when I do a donathon.

04:05:41.560 --> 04:05:43.560
Like I'll probably make the proceeds go to that.

04:05:44.560 --> 04:05:48.560
Actually, I don't really know because like my PC is fine.

04:05:48.560 --> 04:05:50.560
It's not like dying.

04:05:50.560 --> 04:05:57.560
I just have to uninstall stuff because I'm like, I know a portion of donathon proceeds.

04:05:57.560 --> 04:06:10.560
I'm definitely going to put towards like paying off FIA and Reyna's medical bills and then the rest I'll probably maybe like 3D model because I really want a 3D model really bad.

04:06:10.560 --> 04:06:11.560
It's funny.

04:06:11.560 --> 04:06:18.560
I used to like hate 3D models and then I just realized how much I want one to single like people what people do with 3D models.

04:06:20.560 --> 04:06:22.560
So work expense.

04:06:27.560 --> 04:06:28.560
Yeah, I don't know.

04:06:31.560 --> 04:06:32.560
Oh, yeah.

04:06:32.560 --> 04:06:33.560
A 40 series to be cheaper.

04:06:33.560 --> 04:06:34.560
That's a good point.

04:06:34.560 --> 04:06:36.560
If you upgrade the 1070 or 100%, I know.

04:06:36.560 --> 04:06:37.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:06:37.560 --> 04:06:40.560
I think I'm trying to think what my power supply is.

04:06:44.560 --> 04:06:45.560
What the fuck?

04:06:45.560 --> 04:06:47.560
Again, I built this like so long ago.

04:06:47.560 --> 04:06:50.560
I'll have to build a whole new fucking PC and I'm not looking forward to it.

04:06:50.560 --> 04:06:51.560
I'll be honest with you.

04:06:51.560 --> 04:06:57.560
I might just buy a pre-build because I just I don't have the patience to try to put a PC together again.

04:06:57.560 --> 04:06:59.560
I used to love doing it because I did it very often.

04:06:59.560 --> 04:07:02.560
I would my dad and I used to work for him.

04:07:02.560 --> 04:07:07.560
He would just give me PCs to build and unbuild and fix and update and stuff.

04:07:11.560 --> 04:07:12.560
But I just don't feel like doing that.

04:07:16.560 --> 04:07:20.560
I think I have a 700 watt power supply.

04:07:20.560 --> 04:07:25.560
I think I have a maybe kind of find that my email.

04:07:29.560 --> 04:07:31.560
Let me see if I...

04:07:47.560 --> 04:07:53.560
I think I have a 700 watt gold something power supply.

04:07:53.560 --> 04:07:54.560
7050 at zero.

04:07:54.560 --> 04:07:55.560
Okay.

04:07:55.560 --> 04:07:58.560
So then I probably, yeah, I don't think I don't have a 750.

04:07:58.560 --> 04:08:01.560
I thought I had a 1000 watt, but I don't.

04:08:18.560 --> 04:08:19.560
How...

04:08:20.560 --> 04:08:21.560
What the fuck?

04:08:21.560 --> 04:08:27.560
I look up PC part picker to see if I like took a screenshot of something and I'm getting all these emails of all this role plays that I did.

04:08:27.560 --> 04:08:29.560
That doesn't make any sense how these are coming up.

04:08:35.560 --> 04:08:36.560
What the fuck?

04:08:38.560 --> 04:08:39.560
Oops.

04:08:57.560 --> 04:08:58.560
Sorry.

04:09:15.560 --> 04:09:17.560
Sorry, I mislike distracted reading stuff that I wrote when I was younger.

04:09:17.560 --> 04:09:18.560
I'm sorry.

04:09:18.560 --> 04:09:19.560
I just told her like disassociating.

04:09:19.560 --> 04:09:22.560
Cause I was like, oh, interesting.

04:09:22.560 --> 04:09:30.720
interesting so it was like some fanfic about the cuz I remember I told you I

04:09:30.720 --> 04:09:37.080
don't know if you guys recall I um did are you like made OCs for like soul eater

04:09:37.080 --> 04:09:42.840
so it was like a soul eater fanfic so I was like oh fascinating

04:09:42.840 --> 04:09:54.760
I can't find shit I'm so pissed right now I can't even think straight cuz

04:09:54.760 --> 04:10:00.860
these cramps are fucking hurting me so fucking bad it just hit me all of a

04:10:00.860 --> 04:10:04.280
sudden yeah the solid it's like I know I might just like sit with myself when

04:10:04.280 --> 04:10:07.920
I'm like when I'm like bored at my grandparents just my iPad and just be

04:10:07.920 --> 04:10:13.680
like fascinating let's read your shit I remember you said you made the dudes bang

04:10:13.680 --> 04:10:20.040
each other a lot I definitely did I couldn't find anything of that though

04:10:20.040 --> 04:10:24.760
although there was like a saved file that's a schmutz stuff but I didn't

04:10:24.760 --> 04:10:32.760
look at it oh yeah I love soul eater um pre-built is fine make sure the parts oh

04:10:32.760 --> 04:10:38.400
yeah no like the thing is it's so much better to not buy pre-built because when

04:10:38.400 --> 04:10:42.600
you build it yourself you can really get the parts at better prices because they

04:10:42.600 --> 04:10:46.560
usually just overinflate their fucking part like the computer prices so I'm

04:10:46.560 --> 04:10:51.600
probably gonna end up cuz like I remember management told me how much

04:10:51.600 --> 04:10:56.280
Azura's computer was I was like there's no way you needed to spend that much

04:10:56.280 --> 04:11:00.600
money on her computer cuz I could have built her a way better computer for a

04:11:00.640 --> 04:11:08.640
fraction of the price um but PC building stream that'd be funny I think I I did do

04:11:08.640 --> 04:11:14.080
that before I did it back when I was a flush streamer I did a PC building

04:11:14.080 --> 04:11:21.720
stream on like um I forget it's not ready to be fun I don't think I would ever do

04:11:21.720 --> 04:11:28.920
that just because of copyright issues you have to understand that I'm very

04:11:29.000 --> 04:11:36.760
limited in what I can do without getting caught by YouTube just to be realistic

04:11:36.760 --> 04:11:47.000
um I think I might have to get off cuz I'm in a lot of pain right now I love

04:11:47.000 --> 04:11:50.360
building PCs I want to build one of them already I used to definitely have that

04:11:50.360 --> 04:11:55.600
like fervorant passion for building PCs but now I'm just like I see it as more of

04:11:55.600 --> 04:12:03.320
a chore because then I gotta make sure everything's good I'm also traumatized

04:12:03.320 --> 04:12:08.640
because the last time I had to build my PC it was because I couldn't remember if

04:12:08.640 --> 04:12:12.520
it was Rena or Sole through open my case fan and shorted out my motherboard in

04:12:12.520 --> 04:12:15.640
my graphics card so I had to rebuild it and buy a lot of new parts and I was

04:12:15.640 --> 04:12:20.280
crying and bawling my eyes out for days because it was so much money because I

04:12:20.280 --> 04:12:28.360
had spent I'd saved the money I'd sold stuff and I remember it was so fucked

04:12:28.360 --> 04:12:33.960
because my mom told me I think I couldn't remember if she told me it was

04:12:33.960 --> 04:12:41.240
Rena and it was Sole if it was Sole and she told me it was Rena and she had

04:12:41.240 --> 04:12:48.000
apparently known one of them had thrown up in my fan and heard it but didn't

04:12:48.000 --> 04:12:51.120
stop me when I turned on the computer because I could have probably like

04:12:51.120 --> 04:12:54.960
cleaned them off with like alcohol and like wiped it and like made sure

04:12:54.960 --> 04:12:59.360
everything was good she never told me so I turned on my computer and it fucking

04:12:59.360 --> 04:13:04.680
shorted it are you gonna be rich or free of your past self yeah I was like when I

04:13:04.680 --> 04:13:09.840
was working like a really shitty job actually no it wasn't a shitty job at

04:13:09.840 --> 04:13:13.360
all I was a fine job I was definitely underpaid but you know what can you

04:13:13.360 --> 04:13:21.600
expect when you're like 15 yeah but I was yeah I was they threw up in the case

04:13:21.600 --> 04:13:27.480
fan because the case fan was on top because Rena would like and Sole would

04:13:27.480 --> 04:13:33.680
like to they like to lay on my fucking PC because they liked the heat that came

04:13:33.680 --> 04:13:42.160
off of it now on my desk they can't do that because there's a rack there where

04:13:42.160 --> 04:13:47.640
I usually put my some of my peripherals like at my controller and stuff and some

04:13:47.640 --> 04:13:54.480
other peripheral stuff like wires and like all like my gloves for like

04:13:54.480 --> 04:14:00.960
handcams and stuff and so they can't do that because then like I also had so much

04:14:00.960 --> 04:14:09.320
cat hair and Mike like I had a constantly blow air through it when Rena and Sole

04:14:09.320 --> 04:14:12.840
would sit on it because they just a cat hair was just accumulating crazy and

04:14:12.840 --> 04:14:17.920
that's why I ended up getting a case that cuz like my case initially wasn't

04:14:17.920 --> 04:14:22.240
that clear you couldn't see like the inner and the inner parts of it so like

04:14:22.240 --> 04:14:25.760
every once in a while I have to open up my computer to see if it was okay and

04:14:25.760 --> 04:14:36.600
then I would just see a shit on a cat hair and I was like oh yeah but yeah I'm

04:14:36.600 --> 04:14:44.280
like I'm still don't know what plans will be for the donothon again that's far

04:14:44.280 --> 04:14:48.640
ahead but it feels like it's approaching fast to a more months until my

04:14:48.640 --> 04:14:54.720
birthday it's quite nerve-wracking I usually celebrate my birthday alone

04:14:54.720 --> 04:15:01.120
usually don't celebrate it at all to be honest with you so it'll be nice to spend

04:15:01.120 --> 04:15:11.720
it with you guys let's have a fun time cuz yeah HD app is great if you are fuel

04:15:11.720 --> 04:15:20.760
yeah no I know I know my limits I'll get off when I want to

04:15:20.760 --> 04:15:25.120
spoil you on that day what do you want for your b-day I just want you guys to

04:15:35.240 --> 04:15:42.240
with me like it just sucks like I've been alone I was alone on my birthday last

04:15:42.240 --> 04:15:57.120
time and it was so fucking hard so yeah a birthday September 28th I'm a Libra

that matters not this area it's bunny day

04:16:13.880 --> 04:16:19.360
being alone on a birthday even worse is not it's like my family doesn't celebrate

04:16:19.360 --> 04:16:25.320
birthdays for religious reasons so it's like I'm used to it but since I left and

04:16:25.480 --> 04:16:32.360
I would celebrate my birthday with friends and now I miss like not I just like

04:16:32.360 --> 04:16:35.160
don't leave my house that much anymore I'm not gonna be lying to you I'm very

04:16:35.160 --> 04:16:39.880

04:16:39.880 --> 04:16:48.400
like I'm introverted so I preferred this way but I'm I now know the pain of

04:16:48.400 --> 04:16:54.440
being alone at a holiday before I didn't care at all can't believe you're

04:16:54.440 --> 04:17:03.240

04:39:15.000 --> 04:39:20.600
looking through my clips to send to stronti and they're just one person who

04:39:20.600 --> 04:39:25.720
just clips literally everything I do and I have to go through everything and I'm

04:39:25.720 --> 04:39:32.960
like holy shit thank god though cuz I appreciate all clippers where she bees

04:39:32.960 --> 04:39:39.640

future stuff question about clips you want edited ones the ones from YouTube I

04:39:42.720 --> 04:39:50.480
prefer like I prefer edited ones but again that's work that you're doing so if

04:39:50.480 --> 04:39:54.080
you want to do it then that's great but if you don't if you just want to clip

04:39:54.120 --> 04:39:58.200
like something you thought was funny I look I go through my clips and I send

04:39:58.200 --> 04:40:01.560
them to the clippers so like if you wanted you extra work it's up to you you

04:40:01.560 --> 04:40:06.200
don't have to you know sorry Rena's rubbing against my microphone so if you

04:40:06.200 --> 04:40:08.880

04:40:08.880 --> 04:40:16.820
legs and she's just like like that I might have heard her for split second

04:40:17.660 --> 04:40:25.220
Rena are you gonna purge into me we're gonna get some rain appraised

04:40:34.180 --> 04:40:38.580

Rena get her rubbed out okay well she's she's rubbing against the microphone

04:40:50.460 --> 04:40:59.160

04:40:59.160 --> 04:41:04.540
that she's loves to sit on my lap and I'm streaming and headbutt the microphone

04:41:04.540 --> 04:41:09.660
Rena why are you pushing off of my leg like that

04:41:15.180 --> 04:41:19.700

04:41:19.700 --> 04:41:24.580
it because I'm still not comfortable showing myself yet because sometimes I

04:41:24.580 --> 04:41:28.460
do like end up in frame not like my face or anything but just like my arm or

04:41:28.460 --> 04:41:36.820
whatever and I just want to be careful so cat cam will come a lot later now I

04:41:36.820 --> 04:41:44.180
just scratched my fucking eyeball Rena coming in with the content sorry my

04:41:44.180 --> 04:41:50.540

04:41:50.540 --> 04:41:55.300
can you not chew on my headphones lady Jesus Christ I give you I liked it

04:41:55.300 --> 04:41:59.420
better when you rubbing against my microphone Rena it's not a toy she's

04:41:59.420 --> 04:42:04.060
like oh delicious she loves rubber and like the casing of my wires is rubber

04:42:04.060 --> 04:42:08.660
and she's trying to chew on it you're so much of ish and you're such an old woman

04:42:08.660 --> 04:42:13.540
and you just want to chew stuff Rena choose on my crocs

04:42:13.540 --> 04:42:18.660
I'm gonna chew on my shoes she's like a fucking dog

04:42:32.020 --> 04:42:41.620
the audacity you did that on purpose I'm not giving you I'm not giving you the

04:42:41.900 --> 04:42:50.460
pleasure of no no go away go away you're trying to get a rise out of me it's

04:42:50.460 --> 04:42:55.780
not working oh by the way hold on a second I needed I wanted to say this on

04:42:55.780 --> 04:43:05.660
stream rather than say it in a tweet so when I was streaming with mercy the

04:43:05.660 --> 04:43:14.980
other day do not on her stream or any of the girls' stream I don't care if you

04:43:14.980 --> 04:43:22.740
do it on mine I don't give a shit don't super chat her and then say someone

04:43:22.740 --> 04:43:30.140
else is your oh she if you were there you probably saw us all pause because we

04:43:30.140 --> 04:43:35.620
were just like who the fuck does that but like to that person they probably

04:43:35.620 --> 04:43:45.900
were fine with it but it's just poor etiquette and I was very irritated on

04:43:45.900 --> 04:43:52.260
behalf of her if you do it in mine I don't care but mercy has explicitly said

04:43:52.260 --> 04:43:55.620
before that it makes her uncomfortable when people do stuff like that and then

04:43:55.620 --> 04:44:02.380
this person goes ahead and do it don't fucking do that also I might need to add

04:44:02.380 --> 04:44:05.020
a rule to stop making chat about yourself because people have been doing

04:44:05.020 --> 04:44:12.660
that lately and I'm just like um actually you're here to watch me or the

04:44:12.660 --> 04:44:15.180
person that I'm streaming with stop making the chat about yourself you're

04:44:15.180 --> 04:44:18.100
not a chat celebrity this is why we don't have mods that you can see because

04:44:18.100 --> 04:44:21.660
they're gonna be try to become chat celebrities

04:44:22.700 --> 04:44:29.380
mods peck him yeah and like I appreciate this person because they do do

04:44:29.420 --> 04:44:38.100
Supas on my stream and they like whatever but it is if it is poor etiquette to

04:44:38.100 --> 04:44:46.300
talk about someone who is not present and say that they are your oh she because

04:44:46.300 --> 04:44:50.420
that was after this is when the person was gone and we were no longer

04:44:50.420 --> 04:44:54.700
collabing with this person and it was just being mercy and we were shooting

04:44:54.740 --> 04:45:02.660
shit that this happened and I did not like that at all I was very irritated on

04:45:02.660 --> 04:45:11.460
behalf of mercy I'm very protective of my girls and if you hurt their feelings I

04:45:11.460 --> 04:45:18.780
will fucking come for you I swear to God I will rip your face off and I know like

04:45:18.780 --> 04:45:25.420
again it was innocent they probably didn't know but it's just such in such

04:45:25.420 --> 04:45:33.620
poor tastes and I just wanted to say something about that but yeah if you if

04:45:33.620 --> 04:45:42.420
you do Supas like to make stuff about yourself like oh this is happening to

04:45:42.420 --> 04:45:57.060
me or like this I don't I'm sorry but do you you don't use Supa as a medium to

04:45:57.060 --> 04:46:00.940
make a conversation about you we're all here to have fun we're all here to

04:46:00.940 --> 04:46:07.700
escape from life we yeah I don't appreciate attention see behavior and

04:46:07.700 --> 04:46:16.860
donations I'm sorry but I don't no yeah but you guys know what I'll call you out

04:46:16.860 --> 04:46:24.860
yeah you guys know I'll call you out because I'm very blunt I'll probably do

04:46:24.860 --> 04:46:32.900
a little bit more nicer than what I'm doing now but yeah but yeah you guys

04:46:32.900 --> 04:46:38.940
know that I'm I'm nice I have my moments where I'm very nice I'll be honest with

04:46:38.940 --> 04:46:42.020
you and I've said this to the other girls I'm very thankful for the kayfabe

04:46:42.020 --> 04:46:45.020
that I have because I feel like I can get away with telling you guys to stop

04:46:45.020 --> 04:46:51.300
fucking doing something stupid when I tell you to whereas if like Azura did

04:46:51.300 --> 04:46:55.180
that people would be like probably like so off-put by it but if it's me they're

04:46:55.180 --> 04:47:02.540
just like oh she's just being she be she's the Dom you know whereas like Azura be

04:47:02.540 --> 04:47:08.980
like I can't believe she on me I'm such a bad son to my mommy goat goddess or

04:47:08.980 --> 04:47:21.140
like scrawny but I you I do this because also some of the girls just don't

04:47:21.140 --> 04:47:26.380
have the courage to say stuff like this and I will be the big sister I will say

04:47:26.380 --> 04:47:33.260
something because I again I am very protective of my gen mates they are my

04:47:33.260 --> 04:47:36.700
sisters when I call them my sisters they are my sisters I was birthed from

04:47:36.700 --> 04:47:42.380
scrawny's loins or she laid an egg I don't fucking know whatever cul-de-fiche do

04:47:42.380 --> 04:47:56.180
I put them I put them before myself I will protect their sanity and their

04:47:56.540 --> 04:48:01.460
mental before my own because I care about them that much the Lord gets a little

04:48:01.460 --> 04:48:05.180
weird yeah people can't correct themselves they never told what's wrong

04:48:05.180 --> 04:48:09.300
that's why like I'll tell you guys like what I appreciate about harem what I

04:48:09.300 --> 04:48:12.100
appreciate about you guys is that you guys are very receptive to feedback and

04:48:12.100 --> 04:48:16.900
then again I am also I think I put it in a better way because I'm very real with

04:48:16.900 --> 04:48:23.340
you guys I hope so angry she be as hot but scary at the same time you guys

04:48:23.380 --> 04:48:30.900
actually haven't seen me actually mad yet if you saw me actually mad you'd

04:48:30.900 --> 04:48:40.460
probably unsubscribe actually no no that that would not actually was never

04:48:40.460 --> 04:48:46.300
streamed though the one time when I raged and I broke my headset I think would

04:48:46.300 --> 04:48:52.940
have frightened some people she protects you protect but mostly importantly

04:48:52.940 --> 04:48:58.140
she got their back exactly no you guys you guys are like you guys are very

04:48:58.140 --> 04:49:00.860
receptive like when I like when I was getting a lot of like stuff in my

04:49:00.860 --> 04:49:03.980
maros or this was happening or that was happening I'd be like hey guys what the

04:49:03.980 --> 04:49:07.140
fuck's going on you guys can't do this and then they're just like oh shit okay

04:49:07.140 --> 04:49:11.780
never mind and then it just stops and then there's like trolls and shit and

04:49:11.780 --> 04:49:14.140
that's whatever

04:49:14.460 --> 04:49:23.220
but also I just I say stuff and I put there are rules in place to protect

04:49:23.220 --> 04:49:26.900
everyone as well don't forget that I want to make sure that everyone is having a

04:49:26.900 --> 04:49:39.180
good time because after the girls then I put you there and then myself because I

04:49:39.180 --> 04:49:43.300
am here to entertain I'm here to make you feel good I'm here to have you

04:49:43.300 --> 04:49:50.860
heck you have a good time you come to my streams to have fun you come to my

04:49:50.860 --> 04:50:00.260
streams for an escape and I will provide as such as I do care about you I do love

04:50:00.260 --> 04:50:06.300
you all and I wouldn't be you know where I am without you so I say this like

04:50:06.300 --> 04:50:09.900
every fucking stream that's because I just can't get over how thankful I am for

04:50:09.900 --> 04:50:16.460
you guys but yeah a lot of my stuff is teasing anyways like I don't know I'm

04:50:16.460 --> 04:50:20.380
just I'm just a very good actress you guys can't tell if I'm well I just sound

04:50:20.380 --> 04:50:28.180
like a server second guys can't tell if I'm really mad or not I can't I didn't

04:50:28.180 --> 04:50:32.460
know a zur has a lisp and she was like explaining it to me and I'm like that I

04:50:32.460 --> 04:50:37.020
think that's the only reason I can't do your voice is because I can't do the

04:50:37.020 --> 04:50:43.260
lisp because I didn't notice she had one I'm just that oblivious I suppose I am a

04:50:43.260 --> 04:50:51.140
Sarah to lay the fertility goddess

04:50:52.580 --> 04:50:57.380
repetition doesn't make any less meaningful so I'm glad to hear it oh

04:50:57.980 --> 04:51:03.060
so I guess you're an Amy Wednesday if I again I want to do a stream I want to do

04:51:03.060 --> 04:51:08.900

seen the background so often when I'm doing stuff minus when she's like really

04:52:21.420 --> 04:52:24.300
going hardcore with her dad is because then I'm like that's this isn't for me

04:52:24.300 --> 04:52:32.140

05:12:22.320 --> 05:12:26.460
like was such a brat because I'm like I think he was tired cuz he was up his

05:12:26.460 --> 05:12:30.820
boomy boomy's not like a super snugly cat but he always follows me around and

05:12:30.820 --> 05:12:39.820
like is has to be in the same room as me for some reason and so I think like I

05:12:39.820 --> 05:12:48.900
think like he was like really grumpy and overtired like a little baby my little

05:12:48.900 --> 05:12:58.380
boomy boy yeah he fell asleep that's me yeah he was like he never crawls into my

05:12:58.380 --> 05:13:05.100
arms like that usually he'll just like sleep in the bed that I have on my desk

05:13:05.100 --> 05:13:11.100
and he usually only like only likes headpats a little and like when his head

05:13:11.100 --> 05:13:16.940
is rubbed otherwise he doesn't he'll just like hang out near you but he won't

05:13:16.940 --> 05:13:23.220

like inhaling her treats they like really like those it's the catnip ones

05:20:09.340 --> 05:20:12.860
Raina usually likes the tuna ones but she really likes the catnip one we don't

05:20:12.860 --> 05:20:25.900
want to try something new although I can't look at chat I haven't been able to look at

05:20:26.100 --> 05:20:33.100
making sure that the cats give her her space so she can have her treats

05:20:33.100 --> 05:20:59.540
All right, I'm always going you know I'm always here

05:21:00.500 --> 05:21:02.840
Fetch yeah, I'm pretty sure

05:21:03.560 --> 05:21:09.520
Boomi and Fia just like vacuumed those up because I put out so many and I only saw reina like chewing one

05:21:15.160 --> 05:21:21.520
Yeah, yeah reina knows oh my god, boomi what the fuck why are you throwing your toy at me?

05:21:22.480 --> 05:21:24.480

The other cats do fetch reina does fetch too

05:21:29.540 --> 05:21:32.300
Just didn't she be as funny for some reason

05:21:36.740 --> 05:21:38.740
Hmm

05:21:39.380 --> 05:21:41.380
He wants more treats

05:21:41.700 --> 05:21:43.700
Yeah, well Fia is circling me

05:21:43.940 --> 05:21:48.700
She is sniffing my socks because I took my socks off and I forgot them there and

05:21:49.940 --> 05:21:55.260
I'll see you like sweet so that's very young character for her to start sniffing my socks

05:21:59.540 --> 05:22:01.540
Hmm

05:22:08.500 --> 05:22:10.500
One of us

05:22:12.100 --> 05:22:14.660
What the heck is happening to my chat? Let me fix this

05:22:16.900 --> 05:22:19.780
Bro, how do I get ads on my own videos? This is so funny me

05:22:22.180 --> 05:22:24.180
I like have you guys another window

05:22:27.060 --> 05:22:29.060
Grippers out my grippers are out

05:22:30.260 --> 05:22:31.940
Slipping the line

05:22:31.940 --> 05:22:36.500
Me if I was a cat she'd be as a divorce argument in the next room is

05:22:37.220 --> 05:22:38.820
That'd be funny

05:22:38.820 --> 05:22:42.180
And be popping up writing. I usually sometimes I'll set them to like balanced, but

05:22:43.300 --> 05:22:46.980
Yeah, it's a little bit. I wish I could set them to like pre-rolls only

05:22:47.940 --> 05:22:51.380
Because then you guys it would just get eaten by like the way that's what I like to do at twitch

05:22:51.380 --> 05:22:55.860
Is because I can usually have the pre-rolls roll set and then I would just have them get like

05:22:56.420 --> 05:23:02.500
You wouldn't miss anything because it would just be eaten by the um the waiting the starting soon screen

05:23:05.220 --> 05:23:10.500
Getting that ad revenue for yourself girl boss activity again, I don't have a job. This is my job now

05:23:11.780 --> 05:23:13.780
Streaming is my job

05:23:14.260 --> 05:23:17.300
But I wouldn't have it any other way. I love it here

05:23:18.180 --> 05:23:19.300
Um

05:23:19.300 --> 05:23:22.660
I have to go to bed. Thanks for the fun stream. Have fun. Oh my cats have the zoomies now

05:23:23.060 --> 05:23:25.460
I don't know if you guys heard him. He like made a funny noise

05:23:28.980 --> 05:23:34.820
Raina stand up for yourself. No, no, she does plenty. She's rain is the alpha cat in the house

05:23:38.660 --> 05:23:40.660
So they're probably just playing

05:23:42.660 --> 05:23:44.660
I

05:23:46.660 --> 05:23:48.660
I

05:23:49.060 --> 05:23:51.060
So they're probably just playing

05:23:53.780 --> 05:23:57.460
Well, I'm the alpha cat but then like rain is in charge, you know, she's my second

05:23:58.100 --> 05:24:00.260
Command they're in their rebellious phase. Yeah

05:24:01.380 --> 05:24:06.180
She's fucking his statham because he just was some boomy is uh

05:24:06.740 --> 05:24:11.780
Boomy and fia just turned a year old because they're they're still little babies. They're still kittens in my eyes and raina's 14

05:24:13.460 --> 05:24:15.620
So they they verse they uh

05:24:16.500 --> 05:24:17.940
definitely

05:24:18.260 --> 05:24:20.260
Tests their matriarch very often

05:24:21.140 --> 05:24:22.820
but um

05:24:22.820 --> 05:24:28.100
Raina really has warmed up to fia and I think cuz fia reminds her a lot of her sister soley

05:24:28.180 --> 05:24:32.580
They have very similar personalities. So she'll often snuggle with fia. It's very cute

05:24:34.420 --> 05:24:36.420
Um, but yeah, raina put some in their place

05:24:37.780 --> 05:24:43.460
They're just it's so funny how like similar cats and dogs are a lot more similar than you think with like their hierarchal system

05:24:44.660 --> 05:24:46.020
um

05:24:46.020 --> 05:24:49.140
Yeah, they are little babies my little babies

05:24:50.500 --> 05:24:53.220
I wanted raina to have a friend

05:24:54.660 --> 05:24:58.820
Um, it's actually none of those spellings. It's rain with an a

05:25:00.020 --> 05:25:01.860
um

05:25:01.860 --> 05:25:05.300
I wanted raina to have a friend because I was um

05:25:06.900 --> 05:25:11.220
Going back to work after working from home for six months. So I didn't want her to be alone

05:25:12.100 --> 05:25:15.700
In a new apartment by herself. And so I got boomy

05:25:15.860 --> 05:25:20.740
I never had a boy or like a male cat before because I was just like, oh, let me try getting a male cat

05:25:20.820 --> 05:25:23.060
I shouldn't have done that. I should have just stayed with the female cat

05:25:23.620 --> 05:25:29.220
Um, not that I wish I did to get boomy. I love boomy. He's my little son my little boy. Um,

05:25:29.780 --> 05:25:32.260
But she fucking hated him

05:25:32.900 --> 05:25:38.820
Hated him so much. I was I was like, I don't know if it was like and I did all the proper things

05:25:38.900 --> 05:25:41.780
Like I made sure they're in separate rooms. They're in separate rooms for a long time

05:25:41.860 --> 05:25:46.820
I would like move towels around so they could smell each other like how you properly introduce a cat

05:25:47.540 --> 05:25:54.020
And she fucking hated him and she still does. Um, it's funny because boomy has the biggest crush on raina

05:25:54.740 --> 05:25:57.460
100% he's just like give me some of that koo grass

05:25:58.180 --> 05:26:00.180
because it'll like he'll

05:26:00.420 --> 05:26:03.220
Koo at her to play like he'll like get real low and be like

05:26:03.220 --> 05:26:05.220
Oh

05:26:05.860 --> 05:26:08.900
And then raina would just like be like this is like walk away

05:26:09.940 --> 05:26:13.540
Like he tries to like he doesn't do that to fia. He doesn't do that

05:26:13.620 --> 05:26:18.980
He only does that to raina and it's so funny to me. Hi boomy speak of the devil. Hi. Here's your boy

05:26:19.380 --> 05:26:22.580
What are you doing? You just sitting and watching me? Can I get a headbutt?

05:26:23.540 --> 05:26:25.540
Oh

05:26:26.580 --> 05:26:28.580
Um

05:26:28.740 --> 05:26:32.420
He wants a woman who hates him for real. Yeah, um

05:26:33.380 --> 05:26:35.860
But then like he and I always was worried

05:26:36.820 --> 05:26:40.820
Uh because boomy is like so much bigger than raina and I'm like, oh crap

05:26:40.900 --> 05:26:43.860
Is boomy gonna become like the dominant cat? But no, he's not

05:26:44.740 --> 05:26:48.740
Raina still puts him in his place and boomy is such a pussy. Like he's scared

05:26:49.460 --> 05:26:53.700
He's such a he's such a dick, but then he just gets like you will

05:26:54.580 --> 05:26:58.100
Accidentally move too fast and he will sprint

05:26:58.660 --> 05:27:03.460
Into my laundry room and hide behind my laundry machine and I'm just like bro

05:27:03.620 --> 05:27:09.780
It's I literally accidentally knocked the remote off the couch onto the carpet. It wasn't a loud noise

05:27:09.860 --> 05:27:11.860
It was like a like a little

05:27:11.860 --> 05:27:13.860
Fump noise and he'll just freak out

05:27:14.180 --> 05:27:16.180
Boomy is literally awesome

05:27:17.300 --> 05:27:23.220
Um, that'll be some alter women and he just I don't know if you heard the noise he just made um

05:27:23.940 --> 05:27:26.980
and then fias uh then since I realized that

05:27:28.180 --> 05:27:34.740
It wasn't I was a little bit greedy in getting a kitten for raina because I thought it would be easier for her to like

05:27:35.460 --> 05:27:39.780
Dominate which it still that was true, but I thought they would take to each other a lot better

05:27:40.500 --> 05:27:42.180
um

05:27:42.180 --> 05:27:45.700
But they didn't and I I think it's is because that boomy is male

05:27:46.420 --> 05:27:51.060
Um, although he's not like intact or anything. He's fixed. But then I so I got fia

05:27:51.860 --> 05:27:53.300
so like

05:27:53.300 --> 05:27:55.300
Boomy would have a playmate

05:27:55.780 --> 05:27:57.780
as a kitten that can match his energy

05:27:58.580 --> 05:28:00.100
and um

05:28:00.100 --> 05:28:04.660
Then rena would have like a female companion and then it's everything's perfect like

05:28:06.260 --> 05:28:13.700
Yeah, rena loves snuggling with fia fia was so I was I made the joke so when rena was sick

05:28:15.220 --> 05:28:20.820
I was like fia you better not live up to your name because fia comes from fia the deathbed companion

05:28:21.620 --> 05:28:23.780
From elden ring because I love elden ring so much

05:28:24.580 --> 05:28:28.340
and yeah, no expected kid unexpected kids. No, thank you and um

05:28:29.860 --> 05:28:31.860
But in but fia was like

05:28:33.620 --> 05:28:35.620
So close like she was

05:28:35.620 --> 05:28:38.980
With rena constantly like she was snuggling her

05:28:39.540 --> 05:28:42.260
She was making sure she was good. She was grooming her

05:28:42.980 --> 05:28:47.460
And I was worried because I'm like, oh is this mean like it might be the end for rena. She's older

05:28:47.620 --> 05:28:49.620
Like I had already mentally prepared for that

05:28:49.940 --> 05:28:51.140
but no

05:28:51.140 --> 05:28:57.860
Reina fucking bounce back into zoom in and whatever and they just they're like really close together if they're really cute. Um

05:28:59.140 --> 05:29:02.580
Yes, they're playing elden ring tomorrow. Yeah speaking of um

05:29:03.700 --> 05:29:08.260
And then yeah, I always call boomy and fia the twins. They're not actually related. Um

05:29:08.980 --> 05:29:13.060
They came from different litters. I they're both rescues from

05:29:13.700 --> 05:29:15.700
Mississippi from the south

05:29:15.700 --> 05:29:21.060
I went to the same um rescuer who was this really nice lady and um

05:29:23.380 --> 05:29:25.380
One of the uh

05:29:25.380 --> 05:29:29.620
Fia's was the sweetest girl. She's like, I've never met a more snuggly cat in my life

05:29:30.820 --> 05:29:34.100
Oh, she's pregnant at grandpa company. Um

05:29:36.340 --> 05:29:38.340
Yeah

05:29:38.660 --> 05:29:43.620
How do I spell Mississippi mi ssi ssi ppi

05:29:44.580 --> 05:29:46.580
I gotta sing it

05:29:46.660 --> 05:29:48.660
But it's funny because they look

05:29:48.660 --> 05:29:50.660
They look very similar

05:29:51.460 --> 05:29:54.740
mi ssi ssi ppi. How is that wrong?

05:29:59.540 --> 05:30:03.220
Are you from Mississippi? Never mind. Um

05:30:06.100 --> 05:30:08.980
No, right. Thank you actually. Um

05:30:09.540 --> 05:30:10.740
Um

05:30:10.740 --> 05:30:13.380
They look a lot alike because I I really like

05:30:14.340 --> 05:30:17.860
I love Siamese cats. I've always grown up with Siamese cats. I've had um

05:30:18.980 --> 05:30:20.980
Three other Siamese cats before them

05:30:21.940 --> 05:30:23.940
because I had um

05:30:26.020 --> 05:30:28.980
Mari, Naomi and Salah

05:30:30.420 --> 05:30:32.420
And um sadly

05:30:33.620 --> 05:30:38.340
A lot like because of I like I don't think I'll ever go to a breeder again

05:30:39.060 --> 05:30:40.740
um

05:30:40.740 --> 05:30:46.340
Because and then my well, I didn't go it was my mom, but like I don't think I would ever get a cat from a breeder again

05:30:46.980 --> 05:30:52.420
um just because like the health issues that even purebred cats can have um because uh

05:30:54.980 --> 05:30:56.980
Salah died at 11

05:30:58.180 --> 05:31:01.220
Naomi died when she was three which really sucked because she had cancer

05:31:02.020 --> 05:31:03.460
and then

05:31:03.460 --> 05:31:06.580
Mari died, I think at five or whatever. I can't really

05:31:07.300 --> 05:31:08.500
know

05:31:08.500 --> 05:31:13.540
Oh my god, did you hear that? That's boomy if you heard that he's running around

05:31:14.340 --> 05:31:16.340
um

05:31:16.340 --> 05:31:22.180
But yeah, so I got rescues this time because I wanted to give like some cats a chance. I was debating whether or not to

05:31:23.620 --> 05:31:26.580
Get a what was that? I was boomy

05:31:27.460 --> 05:31:28.580
um

05:31:28.580 --> 05:31:35.060
I was debating whether or not to get an older cat because like what my dream would be because a lot of people neglect older animals

05:31:35.300 --> 05:31:36.340
um

05:31:36.340 --> 05:31:39.940
and I would love to get like a home and like a little cool like cat area

05:31:40.580 --> 05:31:43.060
or like dog area where I can like um

05:31:44.180 --> 05:31:46.180
Kind of like adopt dogs

05:31:46.980 --> 05:31:48.980
that are older

05:31:49.140 --> 05:31:51.460
um or cats that are older and kind of just like

05:31:52.420 --> 05:31:55.620
Take care of them until their last days because everybody deserves that

05:31:55.620 --> 05:32:00.180
You know, you don't deserve to be sitting in a shelter for that and just give them all the love and care and affection that they

05:32:00.900 --> 05:32:02.900
deserve because everybody deserves that

05:32:03.540 --> 05:32:04.980
um

05:32:05.460 --> 05:32:07.460
and uh

05:32:08.340 --> 05:32:10.500
Yeah, it would be really cool to do that

05:32:10.660 --> 05:32:16.420
So I was debating whether to get an older cat but for rena's comfort ability. I got a kitten because I know she could handle a kitten

05:32:17.460 --> 05:32:19.220
um

05:32:19.220 --> 05:32:20.340
but yeah

05:32:20.340 --> 05:32:21.860
fia is

05:32:21.860 --> 05:32:28.100
Really cool because I've never seen a cat like a lynx point like her before she's technically a lilac point simis

05:32:28.180 --> 05:32:30.180
Which is like very light purpley

05:32:30.740 --> 05:32:31.860
color

05:32:31.860 --> 05:32:36.420
But she has the lynx markings because I'm assuming that her dad or her mom was a tabby cat

05:32:37.220 --> 05:32:38.660
and um

05:32:38.660 --> 05:32:42.260
But or might have been like also a type of gray point cat because that's

05:32:43.140 --> 05:32:45.140
cat genetics aren't weird

05:32:46.180 --> 05:32:53.860
So she her skin is almost like purple rather than pink and she's very like lavender colored like her gray is like lavender

05:32:53.860 --> 05:32:55.860
and which funny is that

05:32:55.860 --> 05:32:58.980
fiala and I think check check of sabaki in her check

05:32:59.540 --> 05:33:00.980
um means

05:33:00.980 --> 05:33:05.140
means lavender so it also worked out that way so I can explain that to people

05:33:06.260 --> 05:33:10.980
instead of fia the deathbed companion of fia from like a normie a person asks

05:33:14.900 --> 05:33:20.980
Unless you're breeding for livestock or some kind of specific work rescues the more economical and morally superior choice

05:33:21.220 --> 05:33:26.340
Yeah, the only reason why my mom got purebred simis is because she wanted

05:33:26.740 --> 05:33:29.860
simis cats are the only cat that my mom wasn't really allergic to

05:33:30.580 --> 05:33:33.860
Um, and so if she she thought if we got like some sort of mix

05:33:34.100 --> 05:33:35.460
It would make her sick

05:33:35.460 --> 05:33:39.620
And then she ends up still being like solea was fine, but rena for some reason

05:33:40.020 --> 05:33:42.500
Um rena's dander is like bad

05:33:43.380 --> 05:33:47.540
Like I'm mildly allergic to rena, but I'll still shove my face into her anyways because I love her to death

05:33:48.180 --> 05:33:49.380
um

05:33:49.380 --> 05:33:51.380
You know have a good one

05:33:52.180 --> 05:33:55.380
Uh, but yeah, sorry. I'm like talking about my cats

05:33:56.820 --> 05:33:58.820
I'm sorry. I'm yapping

05:33:59.860 --> 05:34:01.860
About my cats

05:34:02.740 --> 05:34:09.140
I can talk about my cats for like what else do I have to talk about? I'm just a fucking old lady hanging out with three cats. I'm sorry

05:34:09.940 --> 05:34:11.700
You can continue

05:34:11.700 --> 05:34:18.580
Why do you apologize because I'm I'm just an apologetic person. I'm just used to apologizing for a lot of shit. Okay. It's trauma. Okay. It's trauma enough

05:34:21.780 --> 05:34:25.220
Um, I will continue to apologize for the raps. It'll never stop

05:34:25.540 --> 05:34:27.540
You did

05:34:29.060 --> 05:34:32.500
I thought about a pure bird myself. I'm wondering so perhaps with a cat something to the problem

05:34:32.580 --> 05:34:38.020
Yeah, I've also like I wanted to get a pure bed dog for like protection and get them specially trained for that

05:34:38.340 --> 05:34:40.340
Um, like a working dog

05:34:47.860 --> 05:34:51.220
That's rena rena, what are you doing?

05:34:55.860 --> 05:34:57.860
Oh

05:34:59.460 --> 05:35:01.460
Reina

05:35:08.260 --> 05:35:14.020
Hey, boomie, what are you doing to her? She's trying to sing the song of her people and you're fucking up her song

05:35:14.660 --> 05:35:16.660
Are you okay, rena? Did you guys hear that?

05:35:17.780 --> 05:35:19.780
My cats are

05:35:20.020 --> 05:35:21.220
Yeah

05:35:21.220 --> 05:35:23.220
They're fighting

05:35:23.380 --> 05:35:27.780
Yeah, that that was rena running around from boomie because sometimes they fight over um

05:35:29.620 --> 05:35:31.460
Our boomie just doesn't know where to stop. Let me check

05:35:32.420 --> 05:35:34.420
Reina, are you good? She's fine

05:35:34.660 --> 05:35:36.660
boomie

05:35:37.220 --> 05:35:40.820
What are you doing? You know you did something bad. You were hiding from me

05:35:42.580 --> 05:35:45.460
What are you doing? Don't give me that look

05:35:48.900 --> 05:35:50.900
Why are you chasing her like that?

05:35:53.940 --> 05:36:00.100
Hey, would you give a reason to do these? You have plenty of toys on the ground that you can play with or you can play with fia

05:36:01.860 --> 05:36:04.260
Must be as hiding from you because you're being a menace

05:36:05.780 --> 05:36:08.340
Who means like avoiding eye contact with me? He's just like

05:36:11.540 --> 05:36:13.540
Why are you sure? Why are you doing that?

05:36:16.020 --> 05:36:18.020
If you're spraying

05:36:18.180 --> 05:36:21.380
Whether the game you're spraying the play with we have to find you another one

05:36:23.300 --> 05:36:24.980
What?

05:36:24.980 --> 05:36:26.980
What?

05:36:27.540 --> 05:36:29.540
Are you grumpy because you want to go into the fridge?

05:36:35.780 --> 05:36:37.780
All right, I did catch an answer

05:36:39.620 --> 05:36:45.220
What are you doing? I want to get you a little more low tide. You look very dapper in a low tide

05:36:46.660 --> 05:36:49.160
You know labor alone. She doesn't want to play right now

05:36:53.220 --> 05:36:55.220
Oh

05:36:55.460 --> 05:36:58.420
Yeah, I warned you you get back

05:37:07.620 --> 05:37:09.620
Let's go home you guys

05:37:12.500 --> 05:37:14.500
Raina are you okay?

05:37:23.220 --> 05:37:25.220
Okay

05:37:34.580 --> 05:37:36.580
Okay, Raina in my arms

05:37:39.060 --> 05:37:41.780
You might hear a growl because she's irritated

05:37:43.540 --> 05:37:50.020
And when she sees if even if i'm holding her and but boomie or fear all around and she's in a bad mood she'll like

05:37:50.900 --> 05:37:52.900
Irritatedly meow at them

05:37:56.020 --> 05:37:58.020
Hi

05:37:58.100 --> 05:38:00.100
We shall

05:38:03.060 --> 05:38:05.620
Are you grumpy because boomie's chasing you

05:38:10.660 --> 05:38:14.660
I will protect you from all around

05:38:15.780 --> 05:38:17.780
I will be here don't

05:38:18.340 --> 05:38:21.140
Cry it's funny because now she's purring

05:38:32.020 --> 05:38:35.460
Fia, can you not grab my wire? It's literally like I have three kids

05:38:36.260 --> 05:38:40.260
Except one's the oldest and then I have two twins that are just like fucking

05:38:41.300 --> 05:38:43.300
cracked out

05:38:43.780 --> 05:38:45.780
Oh

05:38:46.100 --> 05:38:51.060
No, fia, don't try to bap her fucking tail. Fia's like right under my desk trying to

05:38:53.300 --> 05:39:00.980
Try to paw at raina's tail. I know she was just trying to see raina likes to hop into my my um

05:39:02.180 --> 05:39:04.180
bathtub

05:39:04.980 --> 05:39:06.980
And just yell

05:39:07.300 --> 05:39:13.620
I think she likes the acoustics in the bathtub. Oh, you want a hug? I'll give you a hug, Raina

05:39:15.700 --> 05:39:17.700
When a purr

05:39:19.620 --> 05:39:23.220
You want to head but the mic oh there they go

05:39:27.300 --> 05:39:29.300
Boomie

05:39:29.380 --> 05:39:31.380
Oh

05:39:31.620 --> 05:39:37.940
Boomie, let's leave fia alone. Jesus. What is on what is wrong with you today? Okay, hold on

05:39:39.940 --> 05:39:46.260
You might hear fia like yell in a moment. Yeah, that was Raina though. Hold on a second

05:39:47.380 --> 05:39:50.100
Boomie, you're done. You're done. Come here

05:39:51.860 --> 05:39:53.860
Come here, mister

05:39:53.940 --> 05:39:55.620
Get up

05:39:55.620 --> 05:39:57.620
Come on

05:39:57.780 --> 05:40:02.180
No, don't try to cutely lick my foot. Come here

05:40:03.700 --> 05:40:08.420
Come here get up. Why are you so fat? You're not fat. You're just heavy

05:40:09.620 --> 05:40:11.620
Can you get up?

05:40:12.900 --> 05:40:18.100
You're literally you know where I'm bringing you because when sometimes when boomie gets too much I have to put them in the crate

05:40:27.620 --> 05:40:29.620
So

05:40:46.260 --> 05:40:48.660
My ear boomie like meow in a moment

05:40:51.060 --> 05:40:53.060
But he's he's being too much

05:40:53.460 --> 05:40:55.460
I

05:41:00.580 --> 05:41:06.100
Want attention to go to bed. I've given them attention all day today before I streamed

05:41:08.020 --> 05:41:10.020
The juicy cat drama

05:41:11.300 --> 05:41:14.180
They're catnip if they're catnip, do you think that they'd be chill?

05:41:14.180 --> 05:41:16.180
Yeah

05:41:19.860 --> 05:41:24.900
Sometimes like what's funny about boomie is he hates it when the cats like play independently without him

05:41:25.300 --> 05:41:27.300
He like has to be a part of it

05:41:27.300 --> 05:41:31.220
Like fia was just playing with like a ball and that's when boomie came over and just started like

05:41:31.860 --> 05:41:33.860
Abiding her and I'm like dude

05:41:35.540 --> 05:41:40.500
Booby apology video coming soon. We start riding like silent

05:41:41.460 --> 05:41:47.460
These kittens are bouncing around jumping up walls keeping up with the cotton bums. That's actually really cute

05:41:48.500 --> 05:41:53.220
Uh, except make the c into a k so I can be like a Kardashian or some shit

05:41:56.180 --> 05:42:02.500
Yeah, sometimes boomie um forgets that he's so much bigger than the other girls. I've actually like

05:42:03.300 --> 05:42:07.860
Debated getting another boy cat just for him just for a little like buddy

05:42:08.100 --> 05:42:14.020
But I don't think I can sneak four cats in my apartment. So I'm just gonna

05:42:16.180 --> 05:42:20.900
Speaking of that I have to reapply for my housing for my apartment and I don't know really how to do it

05:42:21.620 --> 05:42:22.740
because

05:42:22.740 --> 05:42:24.740
Since I don't have a job right now

05:42:29.780 --> 05:42:36.820
Sorry I heard meowing that again fia only meows when she plays with a toy so but she sounds like she's like hurt but she's not

05:42:38.020 --> 05:42:42.500
He's like meow meow meow and I'm like, are you okay?

05:42:43.780 --> 05:42:45.780
So she's fine

05:42:46.420 --> 05:42:48.660
She just gets really that's her excited meow

05:42:54.100 --> 05:42:56.600
Boomie is cute. Yeah, he is a cutie

05:43:02.340 --> 05:43:04.340
Yeah, hold on

05:43:08.500 --> 05:43:10.500
Are you gonna chill?

05:43:27.620 --> 05:43:29.620
I have a little crate for them

05:43:33.860 --> 05:43:35.860
It's almost like a dog crate

05:43:37.860 --> 05:43:41.860
But you can create a cat I used to create fia once you couldn't

05:43:43.460 --> 05:43:47.540
She was sick to look that when we wouldn't try to play with her

05:43:48.420 --> 05:43:50.420
She was very good

05:43:52.420 --> 05:43:56.900
It's really weird telling you time these cats are very similar to mom

05:44:07.860 --> 05:44:09.860
You

05:44:32.420 --> 05:44:34.420
Have to sit she be

05:44:34.820 --> 05:44:41.540
Yeah, no, they just sent me a notice to renew that's why I'm like, oh I have to fill that out

05:44:41.780 --> 05:44:44.020
Sorry if you hear craziness in the background

05:44:44.980 --> 05:44:46.420
um

05:44:46.420 --> 05:44:51.060
So yeah, I have filled out a little bit of it today. I have to reach out to my former boss and be like hi

05:44:52.180 --> 05:44:54.340
Can you let them know that I'm not there?

05:44:56.020 --> 05:44:59.060
Can you prove to them that I'm no longer employed?

05:45:00.180 --> 05:45:02.180
Because yeah, again

05:45:02.740 --> 05:45:04.740
It's just

05:45:06.340 --> 05:45:08.340
Bro, it's so stupid. Why can't I just like live?

05:45:09.140 --> 05:45:13.940
I can't wait to buy my own house in like a couple years or something. That'd be so so so nice

05:45:16.100 --> 05:45:18.980
Oh my dreams won't come true

05:45:19.220 --> 05:45:21.220
Oh

05:45:30.740 --> 05:45:34.500
I don't know what goes okay. Yeah, me too. They gave me a hard time last time

05:45:36.500 --> 05:45:39.540
So I'm hoping that they don't give me a hard time this time

05:45:41.380 --> 05:45:44.900
Buy a house with a basement for the hair to be lost

05:45:45.460 --> 05:45:47.460
I

05:45:47.780 --> 05:45:49.780
Buy a basement with a house

05:45:52.980 --> 05:45:59.460
Okay, I wanted to see if I can stream till midnight but because my cats are being very rowdy and they're distracting me a lot

05:45:59.460 --> 05:46:02.180

But thank you for spending time with me. I appreciate it always for you guys chilling with me

05:46:12.420 --> 05:46:14.420
Nocturnal kiddies, yeah

Obviously the parents

05:46:26.660 --> 05:46:31.380
Sorry, I'm still yapping. I could yapp for longer but my cats are rowdy

05:46:32.340 --> 05:46:35.700
They're like mad that I'm still like I think they also have just like a shit

Um sleep schedule because my sleep schedule is shit. So they're like chat cat reflects streamer right now

05:46:44.100 --> 05:46:50.500
Not chat cat reflects streamer. Um, let me find someone to raid. I don't think anybody's

05:47:05.860 --> 05:47:09.700
Oh Maro's streaming he's playing Dave the diver

05:47:14.100 --> 05:47:16.100

I'm gonna send you guys to Maro

05:47:29.300 --> 05:47:34.740
Why is it telling me to verify my identity? Oh fuck

05:47:37.860 --> 05:47:42.660
I don't know what any of this shit is I'm just gonna let management deal with that. What the hell

05:47:44.100 --> 05:47:46.100
I don't know what that means

05:47:46.820 --> 05:47:49.860
That's why I don't stop me because I don't can't read

05:47:54.420 --> 05:47:56.420
Okay

05:47:57.060 --> 05:47:59.060
Bye everybody

05:47:59.460 --> 05:48:03.060
Sorry like nine. Yeah, I've been streaming since six by the way

05:48:04.900 --> 05:48:10.340
I've streamed for almost six hours again. I I didn't know I was an endurance streamer, but

05:48:11.300 --> 05:48:13.300
I just can't get enough of you

05:48:15.300 --> 05:48:17.940
Some people thought I was streaming like I like eight or something

05:48:19.620 --> 05:48:21.620
No, I've been streaming for a while

05:48:22.100 --> 05:48:24.100
um

05:48:24.100 --> 05:48:26.420
I was literally gonna get off after

05:48:27.700 --> 05:48:29.460
That stream ended

05:48:29.460 --> 05:48:34.020
Well, then Azura said she was gonna talk to her stream. I'm like, oh, yeah, I'll talk to my stream

05:48:34.660 --> 05:48:36.660
And then look where I am now

05:48:36.900 --> 05:48:38.900
Three hours later

05:48:41.300 --> 05:48:45.060
Three hours later just you know

05:48:47.540 --> 05:48:49.540
Oh god, no

05:48:49.540 --> 05:48:53.300
No, I can't hear it. I was like accidentally my stream is gonna play back

05:48:56.500 --> 05:48:59.860
We love the app. Yeah, you better love the app

05:49:00.180 --> 05:49:07.060
Well, one time I literally streamed for like almost like 11 hours and I lapped for like seven and I like remember looking back at that

05:49:07.060 --> 05:49:10.180
Stream I'm like, what is wrong with me? I'm so lonely

05:49:11.380 --> 05:49:12.420
Yeah

05:49:12.420 --> 05:49:14.420
This can't shut up. I don't know

05:49:14.820 --> 05:49:17.860
I'm so used to like being quiet and like

05:49:19.860 --> 05:49:24.100
Being a listener, so it's kind of nice just to just to talk at people

05:49:30.420 --> 05:49:32.020
Um

05:49:32.020 --> 05:49:34.020
I'm giving you guys a virtual hug

05:49:34.980 --> 05:49:36.820
Thank you

05:49:36.820 --> 05:49:38.820
Thank you

05:49:41.620 --> 05:49:46.260
I am a lonely needy parasocial bitch

05:49:50.340 --> 05:49:55.780
You guys get a little hug and I'm smothered here. I'm gonna put you right between my movies

05:49:56.420 --> 05:49:58.020
like that

05:49:58.020 --> 05:50:01.940
You guys are smothered right between my titties

05:50:07.540 --> 05:50:09.540
I just really just talk the mic between them

05:50:12.980 --> 05:50:14.980
Cool

05:50:16.180 --> 05:50:22.100
I don't uh, my boobs aren't that stretchy to do that with a 3DO. I'm sorry the 3DO is a bit longer

05:50:22.340 --> 05:50:25.380
Whereas this is like a simple at 2020

05:50:27.300 --> 05:50:29.300
That's a little bit

05:50:31.780 --> 05:50:33.780
Ow just set my nipple

05:50:37.780 --> 05:50:39.780
More pillow

05:50:40.820 --> 05:50:45.780
Yeah, 3DO is be hard. I know like I think starting to like a thigh thing, which I was like, hey, that's pretty smart

05:50:47.140 --> 05:50:53.380
Very nice inverse of my experiment experience. Oh, how is she we stream? Oh, it's great

05:50:53.460 --> 05:50:56.100
She ended it by smacking us with her boob

05:50:57.460 --> 05:51:00.100
And tucking us between them and giving us a hug

05:51:01.380 --> 05:51:03.380
I like how I haven't left yet

05:51:04.340 --> 05:51:08.500
A part of me wants this I'm gonna stay till midnight you have eight minutes left with me

05:51:10.420 --> 05:51:12.420
What can I talk about for eight minutes

05:51:13.700 --> 05:51:15.700
I'm not gone yet. Come back

05:51:16.820 --> 05:51:18.100
Come here

05:51:18.100 --> 05:51:21.860
Get over here. Get over here. I'm wrapped up in my blinky

05:51:24.260 --> 05:51:26.260
I'm spoiling you with my presence

05:51:26.980 --> 05:51:34.740
Why would what would I do why would I talk about my my booba? What am I gonna say about it? They're there

05:51:35.540 --> 05:51:37.540
They're large and in charge

05:51:37.780 --> 05:51:40.500
I'm gonna smack myself in the face with them

05:51:41.380 --> 05:51:46.180
Did I eat yet? Um, I had applesauce and a bite of a

05:51:47.460 --> 05:51:53.300
I remember what it was like a case of dia. I just my tummy has been really upset. I can't eat

05:51:54.260 --> 05:51:56.260
I don't know what's happening

05:52:00.180 --> 05:52:03.780
Can I help you right now? I just hopped up my desk like hello

05:52:08.260 --> 05:52:10.260
You coming to snuggle ma'am

05:52:12.340 --> 05:52:14.660
Did you just hear a squeak she's went meh

05:52:15.540 --> 05:52:17.540
You coming to snuggle

05:52:18.260 --> 05:52:20.260
Why are you meowing at me?

05:52:24.180 --> 05:52:30.900
Yes, I also have water I've been staying hydrated because I know if I can't eat I need to drink more water

05:52:39.860 --> 05:52:43.460
You nesting now on me you just like went to a little loaf pose

You guys don't I don't know if you guys recall. I didn't the models were already made by the time I was hired

05:52:59.060 --> 05:53:02.100
In the names. I didn't pick anything. I'm just here. I'm just a voice

05:53:03.060 --> 05:53:05.060
strawney was like, you know what?

05:53:05.780 --> 05:53:11.300
Your voice. I'm sorry to smack my mic because I'm waggling my finger. Your voice is the one that I want

05:53:12.020 --> 05:53:15.700
There's a one that I want a lot a lot a lot a lot

05:53:16.900 --> 05:53:19.780
If it was up to me, I'd be cute and funny and I'd be brown

05:53:20.740 --> 05:53:22.740
I'd be a nice tan

05:53:22.900 --> 05:53:24.900
cute and funny

05:53:25.380 --> 05:53:27.380
character

05:53:32.340 --> 05:53:35.140
I do like my drill hair I like it a lot

05:53:41.300 --> 05:53:43.300
I

05:53:47.300 --> 05:53:50.100
Like a brown cat. Yeah, like a brown cat

05:53:52.420 --> 05:53:54.580
Not go I can't imagine you was a little

05:53:56.820 --> 05:53:59.780
Do they know does he know?

05:54:02.100 --> 05:54:04.100
That's what I was before

05:54:05.780 --> 05:54:07.780
Before I was hired on

05:54:08.740 --> 05:54:10.740
Yeah, boomie exactly

05:54:14.820 --> 05:54:17.460
What are you doing? Why are you attacking the carpet?

05:54:18.980 --> 05:54:22.740
What is the what did the carpet do to you dude?

05:54:26.260 --> 05:54:28.260
He's like a dog I swear to god

05:54:31.540 --> 05:54:33.540
Yeah, I was I was very cute funny

05:54:34.020 --> 05:54:36.020
I

05:54:36.580 --> 05:54:38.580
Talked about about it before

05:54:40.100 --> 05:54:42.980
Sorry, you guys can hear scuffling. That's boomy

05:54:44.820 --> 05:54:46.820
He's chewing on the carpet

05:54:49.460 --> 05:54:51.940
What is wrong with you there's nothing under there

05:54:54.740 --> 05:54:59.460
Boomy there's nothing under the carpet that you need. It's probably like a piece of fucking litter

05:54:59.460 --> 05:55:01.460
Oh

05:55:02.020 --> 05:55:04.020
My god, he's ridiculous

05:55:04.660 --> 05:55:06.660
um

05:55:07.140 --> 05:55:09.140
Crazy cat

05:55:09.940 --> 05:55:14.180
Transfer students shows up and even pink was on gonga homanga bonga gongas

05:55:17.060 --> 05:55:20.500
Um, let me hear the voices he smells it's fear

05:55:22.100 --> 05:55:24.100
It's like it's here. I love will follow

05:55:25.060 --> 05:55:27.060
Yeah, I can't wait. Um

05:55:28.020 --> 05:55:30.980
I'm already thinking about ideas for the 2.0

05:55:32.660 --> 05:55:34.660
um

05:55:35.620 --> 05:55:37.620
Yeah, boomy knows what's up

05:55:43.380 --> 05:55:45.780
Lead hours boomy starts tweaking

05:55:46.980 --> 05:55:48.980
He's literally always tweaking

05:55:50.020 --> 05:55:55.380
That's that's how he meows though. He doesn't like meow meow. He just makes that noise

05:55:57.620 --> 05:55:59.620
It's really funny

05:56:01.060 --> 05:56:03.060
Sometimes he'll actually meow and it honestly

05:56:03.780 --> 05:56:10.340
Shocks me now. So I'm just like, what did you what did you just open your mouth and do an actual meow instead of just like hum?

05:56:15.300 --> 05:56:18.740
I think what's the matter? Why'd you just hop this is boomy nearby?

05:56:21.220 --> 05:56:24.180
The hair I'm at 3 am is pretty much boomy incarnate

05:56:25.060 --> 05:56:31.620
Bro is doing sideways some results on the he was you don't understand. So I don't think

05:56:32.660 --> 05:56:35.300
So what boomy was doing? He was laying on his side

05:56:36.180 --> 05:56:38.180
and he was pulling himself

05:56:38.340 --> 05:56:41.460
Across my hardwood floor because I have a little carpet under my chair

05:56:41.460 --> 05:56:46.100
So doesn't make noise when it rolls around and so he's pulling himself across a carpet

05:56:47.860 --> 05:56:52.180
On his side with his head and it's just like and then he was kicking it with his back feet

05:56:54.260 --> 05:56:57.220
He's dragging himself along with his claws and I'm just like, okay

05:56:58.020 --> 05:57:02.580
Um, are you good or do I like I just gave him a toy to play with he doesn't care

05:57:03.620 --> 05:57:05.620
um

05:57:05.620 --> 05:57:09.380
Another thing before before of course fucking boomy derail stuff

05:57:10.420 --> 05:57:12.420
I don't remember

05:57:12.900 --> 05:57:14.900
Oh, but yeah, so like um

05:57:17.140 --> 05:57:19.140
Yeah, just

05:57:19.780 --> 05:57:21.780
I don't think

05:57:22.500 --> 05:57:26.980
I would like I would like to be cute playing again because I like speaking in my higher voice

05:57:28.260 --> 05:57:32.020
But the thing is I don't think I could do patreon audio in my higher voice

05:57:33.540 --> 05:57:37.540
So it would definitely be like a big gap my way moment

05:57:39.780 --> 05:57:45.220
Maybe I could I don't know I haven't really tried because I can maintain the voice for a long time like emmy does

05:57:45.460 --> 05:57:47.460
Um

05:57:49.620 --> 05:57:51.620
Callous this

05:57:53.300 --> 05:57:55.300
I was gonna make a joke whenever man

05:57:56.180 --> 05:57:58.180
um

05:57:58.900 --> 05:58:02.100
Higher voice works with this model. Yeah, it does like you guys

05:58:02.740 --> 05:58:03.780
um

05:58:03.780 --> 05:58:09.700
It's funny when you don't see when you see my like not my boob chest, but like my upper chest up

05:58:10.100 --> 05:58:15.860
Like a higher voice works really well. Hi everyone. Hi, my name is she be cotton bum

05:58:16.820 --> 05:58:18.020
um

05:58:18.020 --> 05:58:24.260
And then when you see just my head and you don't see the like the pointiness of my chin. I look very cute and funny

05:58:26.340 --> 05:58:29.700
Yeah, the british voice audio like really a lot of people liked it

05:58:29.940 --> 05:58:32.740
That's funny because I can do that higher pitch british

05:58:33.220 --> 05:58:38.580
Voice without the need of the voice changer too. I don't know why the voice changer makes it for people

05:58:40.100 --> 05:58:42.100
Because I can go up that high

05:58:43.860 --> 05:58:45.860
British

05:58:47.060 --> 05:58:53.380
Hi again, it's me british she be um, I don't know if you missed me or anything, but

05:58:54.340 --> 05:58:57.460
I know I missed you. Um, it's been

05:58:58.340 --> 05:59:02.900
Really difficult not being able to see you these last few days. Uh

05:59:03.940 --> 05:59:07.860
I hope you don't mind that um, I missed you so much

05:59:08.100 --> 05:59:12.340
I just can't help that. I love you immensely

05:59:15.220 --> 05:59:19.220
Don't don't take it the wrong way though. I just

05:59:21.940 --> 05:59:23.940
British conny she be

05:59:26.420 --> 05:59:31.300
British she be could be the way to yeah, we just become velour uh eu

05:59:36.900 --> 05:59:38.900
Thank you forever

05:59:40.100 --> 05:59:44.580
Yeah, it's really funny you and people a lot of people didn't think it was me as she be

05:59:45.220 --> 05:59:49.300
Um from my pl because they're like their voices are different and then

05:59:50.180 --> 05:59:52.180
I'm like it's voice acting

05:59:52.980 --> 05:59:55.220
But like I do sound like my pl

05:59:56.180 --> 05:59:59.140
Like it it comes out sometimes when I'm very excited

05:59:59.620 --> 06:00:04.660
Oh my god, we're gonna fucking beat this guy. I swear to fucking god. I swear to god. I'm gonna kick his ass

06:00:04.740 --> 06:00:07.060
Especially when I'm playing like like I'll just goes up

06:00:07.860 --> 06:00:09.860
um

06:00:11.060 --> 06:00:13.060
Yeah

06:00:13.060 --> 06:00:15.060
So it kept up the fit

06:00:16.020 --> 06:00:18.020
Voice acting isn't real

06:00:18.740 --> 06:00:20.740
What are you saying?

06:00:25.780 --> 06:00:31.780
Yeah, all these voices are mine. They're just they're all separate people just leaning into the microphone

06:00:34.980 --> 06:00:38.180
Wait, is mercy streaming today? I don't think she is

06:00:41.780 --> 06:00:44.260
Vilaire, but if us lost the revolutionary war

06:00:46.660 --> 06:00:48.660
Um

06:00:49.780 --> 06:00:51.780
Because voice changers exist

06:00:52.740 --> 06:00:54.740
Oh, I guess that's true

06:01:01.460 --> 06:01:06.580
Hmm guys, I don't go on vacation until the 18th. It's like I still have a week

06:01:07.780 --> 06:01:14.020
I watched arena a little bit before Vilaire could hardly tell too. Oh, thank you. That's a compliment

06:01:14.100 --> 06:01:23.220
Shebethany's inseparate it is shebethany comes to like just like I let her into my apartment and then she comes and she speaks to the mic

06:01:28.740 --> 06:01:30.740
I'm already missing man. I'm right here

06:01:32.500 --> 06:01:34.980
Oh, I'm gonna be gone until the 23rd

06:01:37.220 --> 06:01:39.220
The 23rd

06:01:44.580 --> 06:01:49.140
Yes, I've told chat before I'm going to see my grandparents

06:01:51.940 --> 06:01:54.180
In florida florida

06:01:55.620 --> 06:01:57.620
Why are you looking at me like that, rena?

06:01:57.620 --> 06:01:58.740
Hey

06:01:58.740 --> 06:02:03.620
Why are you so snuggly today? You've been stuck to me like, ooh, you know, I'm leaving soon, huh?

06:02:04.260 --> 06:02:06.260
But you get to see grandma

06:02:07.140 --> 06:02:13.460
We're technically our mom because my mom always say that me and rena and sale were sisters and she was just raising three daughters

06:02:14.580 --> 06:02:16.580
So I guess rena's my sister

06:02:21.860 --> 06:02:27.540
Florida man, I know it's gonna be fucking sweltering. I'm not looking forward to it

06:02:32.020 --> 06:02:36.580
Yeah, no, I might I might I'm debating whether or not do you know bible study or not

06:02:38.260 --> 06:02:40.260
Just because I won't be able to bible study

06:02:44.980 --> 06:02:52.500
I had a cat sister too. I know I'm like I don't like the south for that reason

06:02:56.420 --> 06:03:02.340
My bible I think no bible study would be fun enough for doing it together. Yeah

06:03:04.900 --> 06:03:06.900
We should suffer

06:03:07.460 --> 06:03:11.220
I know I'm nervous. That's why I'm nervous like I don't want my stuff to get delayed

06:03:12.100 --> 06:03:14.580
I'm very anxious because I have a layover as well

06:03:15.460 --> 06:03:20.100
That's another reason because I'm uh, yeah, I said this earlier, but I'm flying by myself

06:03:20.980 --> 06:03:25.940
Because like I haven't gone to see my grandparents by myself in a very long time since I was like 16

06:03:26.100 --> 06:03:29.780
They've been up here, but like they're older. They can't really travel that well. My parents are busy

06:03:30.100 --> 06:03:32.100
They also my parents just left without me

06:03:32.740 --> 06:03:34.740
recently to go see them

06:03:35.780 --> 06:03:39.380
And I'm pissed about that so I'm going it's now my turn to go down and see them

06:03:41.860 --> 06:03:44.340
I was secretly hoping my parents would pay for me, but they did not

06:03:45.540 --> 06:03:47.220
They're like, sorry

06:03:47.220 --> 06:03:49.220
They're on your own and I'm like

06:03:52.580 --> 06:03:54.580
Yeah, I'll be I'll be getting good food

06:03:56.260 --> 06:03:58.260
I see you

06:03:58.580 --> 06:04:00.580
Haitian food

06:04:01.220 --> 06:04:02.820
um

06:04:02.820 --> 06:04:04.820
Yeah, spend time with family

06:04:04.820 --> 06:04:08.660
It's always nice. I sometimes you need that and I think I need to disconnect a little bit

06:04:09.620 --> 06:04:11.620
Because I'm literally on the computer like every day

06:04:12.500 --> 06:04:15.000
Like I don't mind it, but I like I know in general. It's not healthy

06:04:17.540 --> 06:04:20.820
And I'm like, oh, maybe I'll fix my um sleep schedule. I'm there

06:04:24.820 --> 06:04:27.860
So quality flavor in the cell, yeah, I'm gonna get some like barbecue or something

06:04:28.740 --> 06:04:33.940
They eaten Florida gators. I've never had gator. I don't even know if my grandparents have eaten gator

06:04:34.020 --> 06:04:36.260
The long time that they've lived down there

06:04:38.660 --> 06:04:40.660
I

06:04:42.180 --> 06:04:48.180
Think he is gonna help out preventing I don't know. Yeah, it's not I'm not taking a vacation because I'm burning and like I'm

06:04:49.220 --> 06:04:52.980
I'm feeling burnt out. This is like something I planned a while ago

06:04:54.420 --> 06:04:56.420
Like before I was in velar

06:04:57.220 --> 06:04:58.980
so

06:04:58.980 --> 06:05:00.980
um

06:05:00.980 --> 06:05:02.980
So don't worry about that

06:05:03.060 --> 06:05:09.300
Because if it was up to me I'd keep going I was I was literally saying earlier like oh

06:05:09.300 --> 06:05:11.300
I'd bring my laptop with me

06:05:11.300 --> 06:05:16.580
If I could if I had a microphone that I could bring because like my at 2020 is a is a condenser mic

06:05:16.660 --> 06:05:19.540
So it needs to be plugged into a mixer and stuff

06:05:20.660 --> 06:05:22.660
um

06:05:23.620 --> 06:05:28.820
Or I just bring it with me and just like walk myself in the guest bedroom and just like yeah

06:05:29.300 --> 06:05:32.100
I'm trying not to swear in front of my christian family

06:05:33.860 --> 06:05:39.780
What time is it it's 12 o' seven you guys kept me talking you little bitches

06:05:41.940 --> 06:05:43.940
You whores

06:05:47.380 --> 06:05:52.900
Because I'm like why are people saying good night and I'm like wait I've been talking longer than eight minutes just 15

06:05:52.900 --> 06:05:54.900
No, I'm not staying up till one

06:05:56.660 --> 06:05:59.060
If I'm me also Bible studies. Yeah

06:06:03.940 --> 06:06:08.980
Swap out swears with bible verses. Oh, matthew mark. Look at john

06:06:11.300 --> 06:06:15.460
Holy judges, are you sawming me right now?

06:06:19.300 --> 06:06:21.780
Oh my revelations

06:06:27.220 --> 06:06:30.500
Thank goodness my family does not bible study at all the time brother

06:06:31.460 --> 06:06:33.460
You Corinthians

06:06:34.500 --> 06:06:36.500
You

06:06:37.620 --> 06:06:39.620
Oh my genesis

06:06:41.460 --> 06:06:44.980
You know lord and saints names in vain those aren't saints

06:06:46.820 --> 06:06:51.220
How long do you throw gifts normally take to arrive it really depends on the seller sometimes like

06:06:52.020 --> 06:06:55.300
One time I forget what one of you guys got me from like amazon

06:06:55.700 --> 06:07:00.180
Um, but the I also can't tell if it's like it's technically from amazon most stuff is from amazon

06:07:00.900 --> 06:07:03.300
um when you guys buy stuff, um

06:07:05.700 --> 06:07:08.580
And it literally showed up like the next fucking day and I was like what?

06:07:14.100 --> 06:07:19.140
Stream is never gonna end guys get over it mad. I'm unleashing infinite. Yeah, it's no jutsu

06:07:21.620 --> 06:07:27.860
You're acting like a real Judas right now, but that's a bible character. I'm I was saying bible books

06:07:31.300 --> 06:07:34.020
The heels don't yeah like the heels still haven't come in yet

06:07:36.740 --> 06:07:41.380
They like recently shipped a couple days ago and those were ordered like weeks ago

06:07:48.260 --> 06:07:52.500
Like my psalms, but it's not poms. It's psalms

06:07:56.900 --> 06:07:58.900
Hold back the seas for a week. Yeah

06:08:01.060 --> 06:08:03.060
I

06:08:07.460 --> 06:08:12.420
Have this idea for a gift and I wouldn't want it to get there when you're gone. Oh understandable

06:08:13.060 --> 06:08:15.060
That makes sense. It'll just hang out my mail room

06:08:16.820 --> 06:08:20.020
For postal mail guys everybody relax

06:08:22.100 --> 06:08:25.380
The mail room she keeps mails in that room

06:08:27.060 --> 06:08:29.060
Get the gospel out of here

06:08:29.220 --> 06:08:33.060
Like my paul's that's funny. Uh paul was an author

06:08:35.060 --> 06:08:37.060

He wrote axe

06:08:42.020 --> 06:08:43.780
paul wrote axe

06:08:43.780 --> 06:08:45.380
He also wrote more

06:08:45.380 --> 06:08:48.660
Bumi will take it take the mail in and keep it protected

06:08:51.780 --> 06:08:53.780

I just like snap it on what I need not that Ken dolls can't do that, but

06:10:30.260 --> 06:10:36.260
I like I love how I I like jokingly made the daddy joke and some of you guys have just gone with it

06:10:38.580 --> 06:10:44.020
Some of you guys just really love calling me daddy, but you know, it's okay. I'll accept it

06:10:44.580 --> 06:10:49.700
We must have a different Ken dolls. Are you saying that you play the dolls you little bitch, you know, can I?

I don't think I've ever called she be mommy

06:11:37.540 --> 06:11:39.380
It's funny because like

06:11:39.380 --> 06:11:44.260
Strawny's intention with me was supposed to be like step on me mommy, but I don't really think I'm step on me mommy

06:11:44.260 --> 06:11:46.260
I'm just a loser

I think madam is talented enough to do it all

06:13:16.980 --> 06:13:19.140
Dom's can care about their subs. That is true

06:13:20.020 --> 06:13:25.460
because don't like I I dom and sub relationship is all about trust and communication

06:13:26.420 --> 06:13:29.620
