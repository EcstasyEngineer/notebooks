WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
Work. OBS. Sometimes it just ends after I started. I love it when it does that. Okay, I didn't do it though.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
Yippee!

00:11.000 --> 00:16.000
Maybe you mute myself so I don't hear myself.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
Oh my god.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Yeah.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
Because you are so fucking small.

00:28.000 --> 00:37.000
You are on us. Okay, if we're legit with how tall you are and how tall I am.

00:37.000 --> 00:49.000
So I am like this. My legs are so fucking long, bro. And then there's you. You'd be like down here.

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
You'd be like that.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
Wasn't you? Yeah, you a shawty.

01:05.000 --> 01:12.000
Oh, you're so small. I can just move you around. Yeah, she's like my little doll. Oh wow, she's like my little...

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
Oh, you're muted? Oh, you are muted.

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
You attached me. You attached me to you.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
Get me off!

01:25.000 --> 01:31.000
Oh, you're so cute. It's like I'm holding onto you like a little puppet.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
Set me free. Let me go.

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
My cute little sister and me.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
Okay, I'll make you bigger.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
Oh my god.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
Thank you. Perfect.

01:50.000 --> 01:57.000
A happy family. I can't even see my chat. That's why I didn't know you were muted. Hold on.

01:57.000 --> 02:06.000
Oh my god. So how's everybody doing?

02:06.000 --> 02:13.000
Hope everyone's doing well. Yeah, I'm getting ads on my own video.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
Wait, really? Yeah.

02:16.000 --> 02:23.000
I should have just not monetized it. She's a little brats. The immuppet. Oh my god, Emmy Muppet.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
No, oh my god, people are gonna fuck the immuppet.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
Toma's already working on a Muppet for you.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Oh, now I gotta use it.

02:32.000 --> 02:38.000
She just was doing it for fun for our designs, but she's like, yeah, I just want to make one based off of Muppets.

02:38.000 --> 02:43.000
She's making you, she's basing you off of the rat.

02:44.000 --> 02:49.000
And I'm like, she'll love that.

02:49.000 --> 02:54.000
Um, but yeah, me and...

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
G-U-E-R-I-L-L-A.

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
Did I add an extra L? Okay, no, I didn't.

03:01.000 --> 03:09.000
So you probably saw the silliness that took place. It looks like we're about to do an apology video.

03:09.000 --> 03:14.000
We're sorry for getting Strawny's channel a-straked.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
We're sorry for cooking you by having sex with each other.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
In discord.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
We will never do such a thing again.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
Oh, really?

03:31.000 --> 03:39.000
Um, no, but we were just hanging out after our collab earlier and me and Emmy had been cooking up something for you guys.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
And so then we wanted to make a joke.

03:43.000 --> 03:49.000
Then I was going through my scripts because I realized I could record scripts at the same time as being in a discord call.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
So I'm like, ah, maybe Emmy can give me some pointers or whatever.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
Am I moaning? Well, you can tell me.

03:54.000 --> 04:00.000
And I'm reading the scripts and I'm like, wait, what the fuck is off the entirety of October?

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
Like, what is this? I can't.

04:03.000 --> 04:08.000
And so I'm just posting screenshots and glimpses of the script.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
And so I sent it to Emmy.

04:11.000 --> 04:17.000
Um, and I don't know what we're going to do with it.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
You want to act it out together?

04:19.000 --> 04:24.000
I think that'd be cool if we just pick the worst one, you think?

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Okay, okay.

04:25.000 --> 04:31.000
Because I know for a fact that Strani's not going to have me do the scripts now.

04:31.000 --> 04:37.000
You actually have the names of your scriptwriters. I never have names online.

04:37.000 --> 04:46.000
The last one I don't have names on the scriptwriter and if I figured out who it was, I would fight them.

04:46.000 --> 04:52.000
Because my scripts literally before October are fine.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
Okay, okay.

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
Most of them are not that bad.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
In October?

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
Yeah, I think it's just that one.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
That one? I'm trying to find it. I don't know what that could just do with it.

05:09.000 --> 05:14.000
I'm reading the other ones and they're not that bad. It's just that one.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Was that number two?

05:16.000 --> 05:22.000
Um, it's number one.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
Oh no, you didn't look at number two then.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
What's wrong with number two?

05:27.000 --> 05:33.000
Uh, face-mashing and slurping in a better mood, good snogging.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
I'll make you forget all about her.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
Here on Clash Rock, remember these?

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
The most mouth-watering tits you've ever put in your mouth. Play with those.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
What the fuck are you reading?

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
I'm reading! I'm reading the second one.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
I think it's like a third paragraph down.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
Tummy Gurgle. Oh, look who's hungry now.

05:55.000 --> 06:00.000
Sorry funnel cake is gone and the truck usually leaves by now.

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
I'm only teasing. I know this is a bit backwards, but how about there?

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
That's not that bad.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
It's not, it's really...

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
Here, let's start, let's start around the...

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
She glurps his giggle stick against her face so much.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
Where is, I can't add up to it.

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
Hold on, let me, let me control find giggle stick.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
It's up medium.

06:29.000 --> 06:35.000
I have like 101 things that contain giggle in my entire master's group.

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
Is the giggle stick two words? Okay, it is. I found it.

06:40.000 --> 06:47.000
Okay, do you want to, do you want, I'll do the voice acting part and then you can read the direction?

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
Sure, sure, sure.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
Okay, okay. So I'm going to start at enough.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Enough.

06:59.000 --> 07:04.000
So if you go a couple sentences up, it's at the beginning of the paragraph.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
Enough. She forces herself up.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
Oh, I found it, I found it.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
Okay, ready?

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
Take a sip of the water.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
You guys are getting glorps on you.

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
Okay, you guys are getting insider information.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
Although I know for a fact the script is not going to be used, but...

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Enough.

07:30.000 --> 07:36.000
She forces herself up and splurts his gock from her pummeled vagine.

07:36.000 --> 07:41.000
You didn't have that bad a day to where I'm just going to let you forget your manners. Sit.

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
The toilet squeaks in resistance to both of their weight.

07:45.000 --> 07:50.000
You're way too cocky for a man risking his entire livelihood in a public restroom.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
And you forget that this rabbit...

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
She glorps his giggle stick against her fasal nut.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Is mine.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
She begins sliding down and riding.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
Aha, now who look who's whimpering like a bitch?

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
That's right, bitch.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
Ha.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
Domineering Humpery.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
You ain't nothing but a bitch to me.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
And y'all know, bitches ain't shit to me.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
Fucking take it.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
Ha.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
If I were caught in make national headlines,

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
a bitch like you would probably be a single HR email.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
Look at that pathetic fucking face.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
He comes.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
Huh? You came?

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
So...

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
Plop.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
What?

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
Plopping intensifies.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
I still need mine, bitch.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
You selfish motherfucker.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
You think you're better than me?

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
You think you're hot shit?

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
You think now that you've got a bit of cash?

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
You can have any girl you want.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
Look at you.

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
You can't even have a girl show up to date you.

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
And you think you can come before me?

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Ha ha.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
I bet.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Door opens.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
Get the fuck out.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
Do the slams, cops!

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Ha.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
You're nothing.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Nothing.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
You're fuck.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Fuck.

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
She whimpers into a shuttering orgasm.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Ha.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
Oh.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
You came again?

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Ha.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Oh.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Ha.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Oh.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
Wind down.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
Like, wait.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Did he leave?

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Like the door shut.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
I don't...

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
No, someone walked in while they were doing it.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
And then left.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
That's what it was.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
I'm dead.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
Okay.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
Ha.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
That was amazing.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
Ha.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
Ha.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
She takes some toilet paper to wipe the mess.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
Here.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Let me clean you off.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
Slurp.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Pop.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Ah.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
You all right?

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
She begins dressing herself.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
I kind of mashed you down into the toilet there.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
Here.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Give me your hand.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
She helps him up.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Up you go.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
Oh.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
Careful.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
That's what it says.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Can't feel your legs.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Come on.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
Lean on me.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Door opens.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
Uh, or excuse us.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Time skip.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
Okay.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
Slowly.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
Slowly on the bench.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
They sit.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Oh.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
I'll be right back.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
She leaves.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Returns a bit later.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
Here.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
Some water.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Hold.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
So nice.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
I know.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
It's looking nice.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
Huh?

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
Oh, I just have sensitive teeth.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
So, oh yeah.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
They both drink?

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
How about the same cup?

10:59.000 --> 11:04.000
I mean, they just, they just fucked in the bathroom.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
So whatever.

11:06.000 --> 11:12.000
Listen, I, uh, I'm sorry for what I said back there.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
I know.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
I know.

11:14.000 --> 11:21.000
I know you're already having a shitty day and, uh, really?

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
Huh?

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
So you like that kind of talk, huh?

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
I guess with my line of work, I can pick up the kind of person who likes being talked

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
down to.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Tell me, Gurgle.

11:32.000 --> 11:39.000
Oh, look who's hungry now.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
Sorry.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Funnel cake is gone.

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
The truck usually leaves by now.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
I'm only teasing.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
I know this is a bit backwards, but how about dinner?

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
My treat.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
Can you stand?

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
No rush.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
All right.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
Come on.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
I know a place.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
It's not far.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
Wow.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
How romantic.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
Oh, look at that.

12:03.000 --> 12:10.000
The bathroom and then went to, to a park bench.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
I don't know.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
No, I'm not.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
We're not even reading fanfics, guys.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
This is a script.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
We're reading Shibi's scripts.

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
This is my, that was a script that was handed to me.

12:23.000 --> 12:32.000
And thank you for that.

12:32.000 --> 12:37.000
Do you want to read the first one?

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
Yeah, we can do it.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
Oh, I think, I think the first one's a little bit.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
This has to be an audio.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Come on.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
You guys want that to be an audio?

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
All right.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
That's the first one.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
Oh, this one's ridiculous.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
Is it all the pants and part?

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
Yeah.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
My cat's trying to hop up on my lap.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Not now, Fia.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
We're busy.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Okay.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
We're fucking busy, Fia.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
You can start.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
Okay.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Beeping key card lock.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
Unlock door.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
Heels approaching.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
Long night.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
I startled you, didn't I?

13:14.000 --> 13:18.000
I would have knocked, but I own the place.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
I'm sorry.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
She doesn't burp.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
Your hotel room.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
Your hotel room.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
No, you're right.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
This is a misunderstanding.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
Just not the one you think it is.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
Here.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Sit.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
She pats the bed.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
You're the one who is with that rowdy crowd at the bar, right?

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
The one's cheering like a Super Bowl riot.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
She clicks her tongue shamingly.

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
No social awareness whatsoever.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Look at you.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
Apologizing.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
You're not in trouble.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
Not yet, anyway.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
Here.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
Compliments of the hotel.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
She pops a bottle, pours two drinks.

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
Actually, I would have celebrated with you all then and there if I wasn't paraded around

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
by my usual ass kissers and yes men.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
So, what are we celebrating?

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
A promotion?

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Oh, cheers to that.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
She swirls her icing soups.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
This is not bad.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Yeah, this one's not that bad, actually.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
I don't know if you can hear the...

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
You probably can't hear the, um, the donos.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
But someone said, thank you for the $2 tip.

14:30.000 --> 14:35.000
Damn, I need a cold shower to calm my giggle stick after that slurping scenario.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Crick the fuck up.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
Calm your giggle stick.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
Oh, you can't hear them?

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
That's fine.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
This was just lily a girl.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
Guys, you don't have to donate for this.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Um, okay.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Let me see where was it.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Oh, you sounded...

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
What?

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
Go ahead, sorry, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
Hmm, you all sounded like you were having so much fun.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
So, why did you leave early?

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
Tired?

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
Tired of what?

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
Huh, you know, I always like that phrase,

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
drain social battery.

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
It's a way more polite and succinct than fed up with everyone's bullshit.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Straight to the point, you know.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
She takes one more sip and sets her drink down.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Ooh, which is how I like it.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Hmm, how I like everything, really.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Which brings me to you.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
Even as the obvious quiet one of your group of friends,

15:27.000 --> 15:31.000
you made it so hard not to notice you in that zoo of a booth.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
A cutie.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
She steps forward.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
Like.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
She steps forward.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
You.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
She kisses the viewer.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
Making out.

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
What's this here?

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
She rubs his erect stick through his pants.

15:48.000 --> 15:52.000
That doesn't feel like the stick of a man who's tired.

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
In fact, it feels more of a stick that needs to be drained.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
So how about it?

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
Shall we get to the point?

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
Good boy.

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
She nibbles at his neck kissing while she unbuckles his pants.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Disrose.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
Here, let me slide these off.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Now, on the bed.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
Good boy.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
She crawls into the bed kissing and rubbing at his hips.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
What is rubbing at his hips mean?

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
And now these.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Rubbing those hip bones.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
She slides his tiny lighties off.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
His tiny lighties off.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
I didn't catch that one when I read it before.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
It's always the quiet ones with the biggest sticks.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Why is that?

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
Rubbing a man with absolutely nothing to compensate for.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
Glock suckering.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Feel nice.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
Of course it does.

16:58.000 --> 17:03.000
Slippery slobbering until she stops mid popsicle slurp.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
Hey, do not touch the ears.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Good boy.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
She continues into throating.

17:15.000 --> 17:19.000
I think now that we should really get the celebration started.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
What do you say, big shot?

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
That's what I like to hear.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Light teasing.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
She slinks out of her ponzu.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
Bring that dick here, boy.

17:38.000 --> 17:43.000
She starts to grind on the tip before lightly slapping him.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
Ah, ah, ah, don't get greedy now.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
What's wrong?

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
Don't like my cat kissing the top of your stick?

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
Aw, but you're celebrating.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
There's no need to rush this, baby.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
We can party all night if you're able.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
Just allow me to savor this a bit slowly.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Slowly on the tip.

18:02.000 --> 18:07.000
She laughs as she swirls her hips just the bellend half inside.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
And that's what it says.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
It says bellend, everyone.

18:10.000 --> 18:14.000
My big, heavy hips need to savor the shape of the tip.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
Aw.

18:15.000 --> 18:21.000
She slides her kitty down the top of his popsicle.

18:21.000 --> 18:25.000
Glides so smoothly against the top of your popsicle.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
Look at you.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
We're supposed to be celebrating, weren't we?

18:29.000 --> 18:34.000
I shouldn't be having all the fun, but I'm not fully sure you want this.

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
Say, if you had to choose between your new promotion and losing that position in exchange

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
for sliding the full length of your cat.

18:40.000 --> 18:45.000
I mean, your dog all the way to the base inside of my tight, gripping cat.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
What would you say right now?

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
Hmm?

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
Oh, I can't hear you.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
Please?

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Please, what?

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
That's please, madam.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
Louder, boy.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
Ah, good boy.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
Now we can celebrate.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
Segs, slow and heavy.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
And it said with two G's.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
With two G's, it says.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
Hmm, almost.

19:07.000 --> 19:15.000
She be laughs, releasing desperate exiles as she restrains herself to slowly descend down.

19:15.000 --> 19:20.000
The popsicle in capital letters.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
The Triton.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
The Triton.

19:24.000 --> 19:28.000
Yeah, the Triton's filling me so good.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
Here, put your hands here.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Now, little man.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
A nasty laughter.

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
You're going to want to hold on.

19:37.000 --> 19:44.000
Heavy slapping, no pants dance, followed by animal grunting.

19:44.000 --> 19:48.000
Yeah, all the way in.

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
Wetness increases.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
Making your way up in the world.

19:53.000 --> 19:57.000
Still yet, ungh, fucking beneath me.

19:57.000 --> 20:04.000
No matter how hard you work, you'll always be nothing but a popsicle to do.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
You want that, don't you?

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
That's yes, mistress.

20:09.000 --> 20:13.000
Segs pauses.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
Wait, wait, wait.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
I need this bra off.

20:16.000 --> 20:26.000
She releases her fat tiddage free from the burdens of a bra as she catches her breath.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
Now.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
Oh fuck, sex medium pace.

20:32.000 --> 20:37.000
Have you ever seen a more perfect pair of fucking tits?

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
Oh, don't even answer that because you haven't.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
And now, I want them in your mouth.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
Sex reasons.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
Ah, that's it.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
Ah, that's...

20:49.000 --> 20:53.000
Monkey noises.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
Wait, this does monkey noises?

20:55.000 --> 21:02.000
It says monkey noises.

21:02.000 --> 21:08.000
Go on, make the monkey noises.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Ah, another one.

21:10.000 --> 21:14.000
Ah, fit bath for those fat fuckers in your mouth.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
Yes, yes.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
Sex fast paced.

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
More, I want more.

21:24.000 --> 21:28.000
Her pace becomes rapid and animalistic.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
You small time bitch.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Fuck me, you're fucking nobody.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
Are you coming?

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
Coming?

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Are you coming?

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
Fuck.

21:39.000 --> 21:44.000
He fills sheebie to the brim with a nasty load of pent-up gunk.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
Fuck.

21:47.000 --> 21:55.000
Wind down, catching her breath.

21:55.000 --> 22:00.000
Nothing like a little fireworks to cap off a party.

22:00.000 --> 22:04.000
She slips from her drink.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Oh, goodness.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
Look at all that flowing out.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
I can tell you're a workaholic with no time to let loose.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
Just look how much you let loose in me.

22:14.000 --> 22:18.000
She laughs and then kisses him.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Look at that.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Such a content little smile.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
Not that forced uncomfortable smile around your friends from the bar,

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
but a real one.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
It's beautiful.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
Oh, me.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
You're too sweet.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
I don't want anyone folk in my life,

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
but you, I can tell you're different.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
Awkward pause.

22:39.000 --> 22:43.000
Oh, um, that's stuff about you being a nobody.

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
I, um, I was just dirty talk.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
I didn't mean that.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
Any of it.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Everything good.

22:50.000 --> 22:53.000
That's um, that's good.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
Even more awkward pause.

22:55.000 --> 23:00.000
Oh, um, I forgot that I had more work to do tonight.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
She begins putting her clothes back on.

23:03.000 --> 23:07.000
Oh, um, uh, keep the bottle top shelf stuff.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
Or so they tell me.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
I just told the bartender to give me something impressive and stiff.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
Sounds like you.

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
Laughter trails off.

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
So, um, see ya.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
Door closes.

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
Why was the ending so fucking unsexy?

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
Oh, come on.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
That was it.

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
That was the first group.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
The deku accent.

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
I literally, I have tears running down my face.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
I know me too.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
Oh, ooh, ooh.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
Oh, tidy whitey.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
Tidy whitey.

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
Oh, my God.

23:50.000 --> 23:54.000
I just had to share this with you guys.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.640
I know, I just tried to do a loser at the end.

23:57.640 --> 24:01.480
Thank you for this super LP, 4145.

24:01.480 --> 24:04.000
If this becomes an audio, I will seriously consider

24:04.000 --> 24:06.680
something to my Patreon.

24:06.680 --> 24:07.780
Oh my God.

24:07.780 --> 24:10.200
No, guys, there's literally a full month of October

24:10.200 --> 24:14.840
like this, the fucking monkey noises.

24:14.840 --> 24:17.240
I'm like, do they hate me?

24:17.240 --> 24:20.240
Why did they even write monkey noises?

24:24.840 --> 24:28.160
Oh my God.

24:30.560 --> 24:33.680
Whoever wrote those scripts cooked with gas.

24:33.680 --> 24:36.920
Thank you, feel their love for this super.

24:36.920 --> 24:37.760
All right.

24:39.840 --> 24:42.720
Aside from the mildly racist undertones,

24:42.720 --> 24:44.680
this is pretty funny.

24:44.680 --> 24:47.600
Oh my God, I didn't even think about that.

24:47.600 --> 24:49.440
I didn't notice.

24:50.560 --> 24:53.440
Oh, you see, the sweet precious child.

24:53.440 --> 24:55.960
I love you so much, Emmy.

24:55.960 --> 24:59.920
When you said monkey, I just thought it related

24:59.920 --> 25:01.800
to like animalistic, you know?

25:01.800 --> 25:04.120
Yeah, the animalistic monkey noises.

25:04.120 --> 25:07.800
Yeah, but he did write you a little stupidly.

25:07.800 --> 25:09.000
Yeah.

25:09.000 --> 25:12.160
No, so if you guys are new coming in,

25:12.160 --> 25:15.120
I was in call with Emmy and we were working

25:15.120 --> 25:18.120
on an audio together for something else

25:18.120 --> 25:21.120
that she will probably finish up at some point.

25:21.120 --> 25:22.520
And I can't wait for you guys to hear that.

25:22.560 --> 25:23.680
We're very excited.

25:23.680 --> 25:27.080
But I was like, oh, since I figured out

25:27.080 --> 25:29.120
I can record during a call,

25:29.120 --> 25:31.240
let me look at my stuff right now

25:31.240 --> 25:33.000
and we can just like hang out and I can record

25:33.000 --> 25:34.360
and you can like make fun of me, whatever.

25:34.360 --> 25:37.920
So I'm looking at my October scripts.

25:37.920 --> 25:39.080
I haven't recorded September yet.

25:39.080 --> 25:40.480
I was looking at October because I was like,

25:40.480 --> 25:41.640
oh yeah, what are my scripts again?

25:41.640 --> 25:44.080
I didn't read it that far ahead.

25:44.080 --> 25:47.400
And I'm just like, I'm like, what is this?

25:47.400 --> 25:50.280
And I'm like sending screenshots in our discord

25:50.320 --> 25:51.400
with the other girls.

25:51.400 --> 25:54.080
And I'm like, Strani, Strani, please.

25:54.080 --> 25:54.920
What is it?

25:54.920 --> 25:55.760
What is this?

25:55.760 --> 25:58.680
And I'm like, what are these?

25:58.680 --> 26:00.440
What are these?

26:00.440 --> 26:02.480
Oh, I'm like, she definitely, I'm like,

26:02.480 --> 26:06.080
Strani probably had faith in the script writer

26:06.080 --> 26:07.920
or that somebody was trolling

26:07.920 --> 26:11.200
and just fucking just did something.

26:11.200 --> 26:12.040
Or I don't know.

26:12.040 --> 26:15.440
Maybe someone got hold of the link for my scripts.

26:15.440 --> 26:16.280
I don't know.

26:17.320 --> 26:18.720
So who knows?

26:18.720 --> 26:21.600
I think it's genuinely the script writer.

26:21.600 --> 26:22.440
I want to just note,

26:22.440 --> 26:25.320
because my script writers usually write off

26:25.320 --> 26:28.000
what they've written and this person did it.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.440
And I feel like they did that on purpose.

26:29.440 --> 26:31.520
They were ashamed, they were ashamed.

26:31.520 --> 26:32.340
It's great though.

26:32.340 --> 26:34.740
So that was, that's the first script for,

26:35.720 --> 26:37.320
it's called Entanglements.

26:37.320 --> 26:38.440
It's a Shelby or Shibi.

26:38.440 --> 26:39.920
And it's supposed to be, that was,

26:39.920 --> 26:42.320
it's a four for the entire month.

26:42.320 --> 26:43.320
It's just a continuation.

26:43.320 --> 26:44.200
It's a story.

26:46.120 --> 26:48.200
You know what I think we should do, Amy?

26:49.560 --> 26:52.840
I think we should do the other scripts.

26:53.800 --> 26:55.040
You want to spoil them?

26:55.040 --> 26:56.040
At a later time.

26:56.040 --> 26:58.240
I'll ask Strani if we could do,

26:58.240 --> 27:00.960
I think she'll be fine if we did this one.

27:00.960 --> 27:04.880
But I think if we did that as like a little Mimi joke,

27:06.920 --> 27:11.920
or if I record them seriously with you narrating the activity,

27:12.520 --> 27:15.220
I think that would be absolutely peak.

27:16.060 --> 27:17.620
It would.

27:17.620 --> 27:18.460
Yeah.

27:18.460 --> 27:19.860
And we can just like upload both to our,

27:19.860 --> 27:21.180
both of our Patreons.

27:22.380 --> 27:23.620
That would be funny.

27:23.620 --> 27:26.460
I don't think any of the other girls had stuff like this.

27:26.460 --> 27:27.940
I think it was just me.

27:28.940 --> 27:31.020
Yeah, I don't have anything like that,

27:31.020 --> 27:32.100
but I haven't like,

27:32.100 --> 27:34.940
they haven't written up to October for me.

27:34.940 --> 27:35.780
Yeah.

27:35.780 --> 27:36.620
So that's why.

27:36.620 --> 27:37.460
Yeah.

27:37.460 --> 27:39.380
So I don't know if like the script writers,

27:39.380 --> 27:43.020
but it's good because it's good that I fucking noticed it

27:43.020 --> 27:45.300
because I would hate for the girls to get other stuff.

27:45.300 --> 27:48.620
And like, like I see who I know,

27:48.620 --> 27:50.740
Strani was saying who's ESL might not like,

27:50.740 --> 27:52.300
quite understands like, okay,

27:52.300 --> 27:53.900
I guess I just read this then.

27:55.100 --> 27:57.860
And think that it's like sounds okay when it doesn't.

28:00.020 --> 28:01.940
Honestly though, I think I see would have noticed

28:01.940 --> 28:04.020
and been like, what is this?

28:04.020 --> 28:04.860
Yeah.

28:04.860 --> 28:08.180
I don't think I see would just like read out like,

28:08.180 --> 28:09.020
yeah.

28:09.020 --> 28:09.860
Lucky noises.

28:13.500 --> 28:16.900
Oh, this is, this would be funny for April Fool's as well.

28:16.900 --> 28:20.100
Just do like a meme-y, like really meme-y,

28:20.100 --> 28:22.700
lewd audios for, oh my God.

28:22.700 --> 28:23.700
I'm asking Strani about that.

28:23.700 --> 28:24.860
I think that's a good idea.

28:24.860 --> 28:25.700
Yeah.

28:25.700 --> 28:26.540
It's Tracy and Daddy ESL.

28:26.540 --> 28:27.380
Yeah.

28:27.380 --> 28:28.220
I don't think, yeah.

28:28.220 --> 28:29.740
Yeah, you're right, you're right.

28:29.740 --> 28:30.580
Kickles.

28:33.060 --> 28:34.740
Oh my God.

28:34.740 --> 28:37.700
But I hope we didn't stress Strani out too much.

28:38.540 --> 28:43.860
I mean, she was gonna find out sooner or later.

28:43.860 --> 28:46.540
It'd be funny if I like center the audio.

28:46.540 --> 28:48.020
I should, I imagine if I didn't say anything

28:48.020 --> 28:50.660
and I just recorded it, it just said it to her.

28:50.660 --> 28:53.100
I don't think she listens to our audio,

28:53.100 --> 28:55.180
so I think it would have passed.

28:57.540 --> 28:59.820
I think you're the only one who got scripts like this

28:59.820 --> 29:00.940
because you're the only one to view a letter

29:00.940 --> 29:03.220
that can turn a sex script into a joke

29:03.220 --> 29:05.140
with my impersonations.

29:05.140 --> 29:06.580
It's beat comedy.

29:06.580 --> 29:10.020
Thank you for this, I like that.

29:10.020 --> 29:11.540
That's good.

29:11.540 --> 29:12.820
Give that a little heart.

29:14.420 --> 29:15.740
It's for myself.

29:17.100 --> 29:18.060
That's so great.

29:18.060 --> 29:19.060
I guess Strani was more,

29:19.060 --> 29:20.300
way more stressed by her card game.

29:20.300 --> 29:23.220
Yeah, I saw she was, she was sweating a little bit.

29:23.220 --> 29:24.460
Oh my God.

29:25.340 --> 29:28.380
But thanks for stopping by Emmy.

29:28.380 --> 29:29.220
I just asked,

29:29.220 --> 29:31.380
because I know Emmy has some stuff to get done.

29:31.380 --> 29:35.060
So thank you for spending time with me real briefly.

29:35.060 --> 29:36.460
Thanks for having me.

29:39.020 --> 29:41.140
I love you, Emmy.

29:41.140 --> 29:42.380
I love you too.

29:42.380 --> 29:43.820
Have fun, what are you doing next?

29:43.820 --> 29:45.980
I don't know, I'm probably just gonna yap.

29:45.980 --> 29:47.300
Okay, have fun yapping.

29:47.300 --> 29:49.340
Yeah, I'm something, I don't know.

29:49.340 --> 29:50.420
I'll see you later.

29:50.420 --> 29:51.740
Bye, Harold.

29:52.580 --> 29:53.420
And the pin pals.

29:53.420 --> 29:54.740
We got some pin pals in the chat.

29:54.740 --> 29:57.060
Pin pals, goodbye, goodbye.

29:57.060 --> 29:57.900
See you later.

29:57.900 --> 29:59.220
Bye, bye, bye.

30:05.900 --> 30:09.500
Wait, I forget that I have to like, quit the collab.

30:09.500 --> 30:12.180
She's like, stop it.

30:12.180 --> 30:13.420
She's like, doing stuff.

30:15.420 --> 30:17.540
All right, I'm sorry, little sister gone.

30:23.740 --> 30:24.580
Okay.

30:26.380 --> 30:28.060
I'm like so far behind in my own bond.

30:28.060 --> 30:29.580
I'm like, what the fuck?

30:29.580 --> 30:31.860
Oh, I'm not leaving it.

30:31.860 --> 30:33.340
I'll probably like stay on for a little bit,

30:33.340 --> 30:35.660
but like, yeah, I just had to share that with you guys.

30:35.660 --> 30:37.220
I love Emmy so much.

30:37.220 --> 30:38.060
We've been in call.

30:38.060 --> 30:40.460
We were in call together for a little bit,

30:40.460 --> 30:43.780
and then Mercy had some stuff to do too.

30:43.780 --> 30:47.660
Cause it was literally like me, I see Mercy and Emmy

30:47.660 --> 30:49.820
and Strani for a little bit, just hanging out.

30:49.820 --> 30:51.340
And Strani had a stream.

30:51.340 --> 30:54.060
I see how to go to bed to pour a little polar bear.

30:54.060 --> 30:55.700
And Azura was streaming,

30:55.700 --> 30:58.820
and then Mercy had to go take care of some stuff.

30:58.820 --> 31:00.740
So, but that was, it was,

31:00.740 --> 31:04.020
so yeah, me and, me and Emmy were just like chatting.

31:04.020 --> 31:04.980
And I'm just like, you know,

31:04.980 --> 31:07.460
cause she has a lot more experience with me

31:07.460 --> 31:10.300
than me with like audios and stuff.

31:10.300 --> 31:11.980
So I was just like grabbing pointers from her.

31:11.980 --> 31:13.300
And she's like, you're doing really good.

31:13.300 --> 31:14.140
I'm like, yeah.

31:14.140 --> 31:16.540
And then I'm like, let me look at my audios.

31:16.540 --> 31:18.920
And let me look at my script.

31:20.180 --> 31:25.180
And I was like, wait a second, something's not right.

31:25.940 --> 31:28.180
Something's not right.

31:29.180 --> 31:30.900
This is the most feeler.

31:30.900 --> 31:32.220
I was really funny.

31:32.220 --> 31:33.380
It was really funny.

31:34.260 --> 31:35.100
It was really fun.

31:36.420 --> 31:39.140
Yeah, so the whole month of October is like that.

31:42.540 --> 31:44.860
November and December are still on the writing stage.

31:44.860 --> 31:49.140
I haven't started recording September yet,

31:49.140 --> 31:51.380
but I was gonna record September

31:51.380 --> 31:54.080
after the, I got off Call of Emmy,

31:54.940 --> 31:57.040
but then I got distracted with this.

31:58.940 --> 32:03.940
But yeah, cause I think October was supposed to be the month

32:04.340 --> 32:06.400
where I was like the Dommie month,

32:06.400 --> 32:08.500
but like, I'll be honest with you.

32:10.220 --> 32:11.380
There's just, you can just like,

32:11.380 --> 32:14.520
some of my first scripts were written by like Strani.

32:14.520 --> 32:16.340
And you could tell like a woman wrote them

32:16.340 --> 32:17.960
versus like a man writing this,

32:17.960 --> 32:19.620
although this is definitely very meme-y.

32:19.620 --> 32:21.660
So I don't know if like they were taking it serious.

32:21.660 --> 32:22.500
I don't know.

32:22.500 --> 32:25.620
But then I have like one of our other script writers,

32:25.620 --> 32:27.740
Etwa, and they have good scripts too.

32:27.740 --> 32:31.580
So I'm like, they wrote very similarly to Strani.

32:31.580 --> 32:33.900
So I'm like, okay, maybe, I don't know.

32:33.900 --> 32:35.620
Maybe they just like never written before.

32:35.620 --> 32:37.060
I don't know what happened.

32:39.500 --> 32:40.420
I also didn't tweet.

32:40.420 --> 32:41.260
I'm sorry.

32:41.260 --> 32:43.020
I didn't like tweet to say I was live or anything.

32:43.020 --> 32:45.060
I was just like, I'm here.

32:45.060 --> 32:46.180
So I apologize.

32:46.180 --> 32:48.020
Cause I was just like, okay, we need to tell the people this

32:48.020 --> 32:51.380
and give them an explanation as to what we were doing in Call.

32:51.380 --> 32:53.380
Although we immediately prepared ourselves

32:53.380 --> 32:55.140
and we heard Strani's like, we're gonna hop and call.

32:55.140 --> 32:57.060
And we were like, okay, start moaning.

32:57.100 --> 32:58.020
Start doing stuff.

33:00.020 --> 33:02.980
But I hope that gets clipped cause it would be so funny.

33:02.980 --> 33:05.060
Um, yeah.

33:05.060 --> 33:06.980
It was literally, but it's not even chat, GPT,

33:06.980 --> 33:09.380
chat, GPT would not write something like that.

33:10.740 --> 33:12.660
Chat, GPT would never write something like that.

33:12.660 --> 33:13.500
I don't think.

33:15.340 --> 33:16.780
But it was, yeah, it was so bad.

33:16.780 --> 33:17.620
It was great.

33:18.900 --> 33:20.580
I can imagine the script writer must have felt bad

33:20.580 --> 33:21.740
about writing a lot of script

33:21.740 --> 33:23.700
and so I had some meme humor in the parentheses

33:23.700 --> 33:26.180
since narration isn't meant to be read out loud.

33:26.180 --> 33:31.100
Yes, but even like, even with the dialogue

33:31.100 --> 33:35.460
in the later scripts, it's not good.

33:35.460 --> 33:36.940
And that was just the first script.

33:36.940 --> 33:39.220
It gets progressively worse.

33:40.300 --> 33:42.980
And we have more than one script writer.

33:44.180 --> 33:49.180
So it's not like one person is writing 30 scripts a month.

33:52.340 --> 33:55.100
It's like there's multiple people writing us scripts.

33:56.780 --> 33:58.420
And then Strani will also like chime in

33:58.420 --> 33:59.980
every once in a while as well.

34:02.180 --> 34:03.300
As a lead translator myself,

34:03.300 --> 34:04.900
these scripts were not something I never considered

34:04.900 --> 34:06.220
except it will work for me.

34:06.220 --> 34:07.940
Kind of, exactly.

34:07.940 --> 34:12.940
It's like when I, one, they're doing a lot of like direction

34:13.340 --> 34:14.980
and then like when I, I don't know,

34:14.980 --> 34:18.820
maybe it's because like one of our other script writers

34:18.820 --> 34:21.580
and Strani just writes differently when they give me scripts,

34:21.580 --> 34:25.420
but they do a lot of like direction and what's going on.

34:25.420 --> 34:27.900
They're doing a lot of saying and not,

34:27.900 --> 34:29.500
or they're doing a lot of showing and not saying,

34:29.500 --> 34:31.900
which is not what you do for an actual script.

34:33.380 --> 34:35.380
At some point you should hold script writing competitions

34:35.380 --> 34:37.100
and pick the best four for each month.

34:37.100 --> 34:38.700
Oh, that'd be pretty cool.

34:38.700 --> 34:41.180
For like maybe like a special month, we do that.

34:41.180 --> 34:42.220
That'd be really nice.

34:42.220 --> 34:43.300
That's a good idea.

34:43.300 --> 34:44.700
Bring out with Strani.

34:44.700 --> 34:45.540
She be a bridge.

34:45.540 --> 34:48.140
That's literally, this is the month of October,

34:48.140 --> 34:49.140
she be a bridge.

34:52.260 --> 34:54.380
Big shout out to Smoothie for a good evening.

34:54.380 --> 34:56.340
Big shout out to Smoothie for their viewer debut.

34:56.340 --> 34:58.340
Oh, a hundred percent, yes.

34:58.340 --> 34:59.500
Thank you so much to Smoothie

34:59.500 --> 35:02.300
for doing a debut compilation of us.

35:02.300 --> 35:04.300
I was like, holy crap, this is awesome.

35:04.300 --> 35:05.140
It was so good.

35:05.140 --> 35:05.980
I was laughing.

35:05.980 --> 35:07.820
I'm like, I was so embarrassed.

35:07.820 --> 35:10.340
The first opening line for the video

35:10.340 --> 35:12.660
is welcome to be sucky fucky.

35:12.660 --> 35:13.860
Well, where did you fucky?

35:13.860 --> 35:15.540
You're sucking whatever the fuck I said.

35:15.540 --> 35:16.500
I was like, oh my God.

35:16.500 --> 35:19.020
Yeah, mommy's scripts are very, very good.

35:19.020 --> 35:20.300
And I've also learned a lot

35:20.300 --> 35:22.020
since I've started doing scripts,

35:22.020 --> 35:24.060
like what you guys like, what you guys don't like

35:24.060 --> 35:25.300
and like how you want me to read things.

35:25.300 --> 35:27.260
I've also fixed my 3DO.

35:28.180 --> 35:33.180
So it's, yeah, please watch Smoothie's video.

35:33.660 --> 35:36.060
It was really, really funny

35:37.380 --> 35:38.980
how he edited us all together.

35:43.140 --> 35:47.980
But yeah, so, and I'm probably gonna hold

35:47.980 --> 35:51.140
some sort of like script writing stream when I come back

35:51.140 --> 35:54.300
because, and I've mentioned doing this before,

35:54.300 --> 35:56.860
before I read the script, but I'm like, okay,

35:56.860 --> 35:58.340
if this is the script that gets submitted,

35:58.340 --> 36:00.140
I know I can write better than this.

36:01.860 --> 36:04.620
Because like for example,

36:06.340 --> 36:09.500
it's like everything's like, when like Shrani writes,

36:09.500 --> 36:11.900
it's like everything's guided and like by word of mouth

36:11.900 --> 36:16.500
and it's very, it's very like seductive and alluring.

36:16.500 --> 36:18.860
And it's like, she's through the dialogue,

36:18.860 --> 36:20.620
she's telling you what's happening.

36:20.700 --> 36:23.900
But this person was mostly just writing direction

36:23.900 --> 36:25.540
and it was very odd.

36:26.340 --> 36:28.420
I'm like, we're not acting it out,

36:28.420 --> 36:30.420
but I'm so sorry to the script writer if you're watching,

36:30.420 --> 36:33.020
but that was very silly.

36:35.740 --> 36:39.060
There were some very, very good things in there.

36:40.660 --> 36:42.380
Hi, hi, hi.

36:42.380 --> 36:45.620
But yeah, I wanted to like hop on and show you guys that,

36:45.620 --> 36:47.620
but I can't wait for you guys to listen to the audio

36:47.620 --> 36:49.420
that me and Amy just did together.

36:49.420 --> 36:50.460
It was really nice.

36:50.460 --> 36:51.900
You guys don't like it.

36:53.300 --> 36:57.020
But yeah, it's inspired by a certain someone

36:58.020 --> 37:01.860
who did a similar script in the past

37:01.860 --> 37:03.500
that a lot of people enjoyed.

37:03.500 --> 37:05.900
And so we wanted to do one ourselves.

37:07.340 --> 37:09.380
Script writer, you cooked, but it was the wrong menu.

37:09.380 --> 37:12.220
Honestly, facts, like the script is awesome,

37:12.220 --> 37:13.300
but it's awesomely bad.

37:13.300 --> 37:15.060
But it's like, you know, like it's like,

37:15.060 --> 37:17.060
I'm trying to say this as nice as way possible.

37:18.020 --> 37:20.020
Yeah, a certain someone.

37:22.140 --> 37:23.460
Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.

37:23.460 --> 37:24.980
Hello, hello.

37:24.980 --> 37:27.660
Where is the audio gonna be uploaded?

37:27.660 --> 37:30.500
I think she's uploading it to Twitter.

37:30.500 --> 37:32.660
I think part one, there's two parts,

37:32.660 --> 37:35.340
part one, I think will be on mine

37:35.340 --> 37:37.100
and I think part two will be on mine,

37:37.100 --> 37:38.660
either one, we each have a part.

37:41.140 --> 37:42.460
Amy's a good script writer.

37:42.460 --> 37:43.980
She's also a very good actress

37:43.980 --> 37:48.220
because we were in call together, working out the script.

37:48.220 --> 37:52.700
And so I had to sit there and listen to her, do her lines,

37:52.700 --> 37:54.940
and I'm trying so hard not to laugh.

37:58.380 --> 38:02.320
Yeah, it'll be a Twitter audio, I'm pretty sure.

38:03.780 --> 38:05.720
Just so everybody can see it.

38:05.720 --> 38:07.160
Yeah, it's a short thing.

38:07.160 --> 38:09.260
It's not like 10 minutes long.

38:09.260 --> 38:12.500
It's literally like two minutes, if not shorter than that.

38:12.500 --> 38:13.680
Her audio with IC was base.

38:13.680 --> 38:16.240
I heard it was, I heard it was really good.

38:16.240 --> 38:18.640
You're gonna piss myself laughing.

38:18.640 --> 38:19.480
I lost it, yeah.

38:19.480 --> 38:23.480
Dude, I was literally losing it in the call with Emmy.

38:23.480 --> 38:25.000
I'm like, Emmy, please look at this.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.040
Please tell me I'm not going crazy.

38:27.040 --> 38:28.960
And then I posted it and I was like, manager,

38:28.960 --> 38:29.920
is this your fault?

38:29.920 --> 38:32.040
And they were just like, why am I catching strays?

38:32.040 --> 38:33.520
No.

38:33.520 --> 38:35.440
And I'm like, I'm telling Strani.

38:35.440 --> 38:37.320
And I'm like, Strani, please, please.

38:37.320 --> 38:40.000
That's when I hopped around like Emmy, let's hop in the call.

38:40.000 --> 38:43.000
And she's like, oh my God, but we were cackling so hard.

38:43.880 --> 38:47.960
But now I know what you guys get for Emmy's audios.

38:48.880 --> 38:51.480
She gave me a little taste and I'm like, okay.

38:52.480 --> 38:53.560
All right, all right.

38:53.560 --> 38:56.400
Oh my gosh, I can see.

38:56.400 --> 38:59.280
Like, damn, my little sister's so talented.

39:00.520 --> 39:04.120
And I'm like, how do I sound like that?

39:04.120 --> 39:05.960
Like teach me your ways.

39:05.960 --> 39:06.920
She does spoil you.

39:06.920 --> 39:08.560
I was like, damn.

39:08.560 --> 39:11.360
I was gripping my mouse, listening to her like, excuse me.

39:12.360 --> 39:14.720
I want to be just like Emmy.

39:17.480 --> 39:19.360
But it was, yeah, it was really fun to record.

39:19.360 --> 39:21.800
And then now that I know that we both know

39:21.800 --> 39:24.440
that we can record stuff in calls with each other,

39:24.440 --> 39:25.880
we definitely want to get the other girls

39:25.880 --> 39:27.360
to record stuff with us in calls

39:27.360 --> 39:29.640
because it would just be so funny.

39:29.640 --> 39:32.240
And then we can also give each other like tips and stuff.

39:33.360 --> 39:36.840
And then like, yeah, I think it would just be great.

39:37.760 --> 39:40.400
Nilsis, Emmy, Big Sis, Gibi, exactly.

39:41.240 --> 39:42.840
But yeah, I'm sure, like the pin pals

39:42.840 --> 39:44.360
are definitely gonna like it.

39:44.360 --> 39:46.240
Harem is definitely gonna like it.

39:47.560 --> 39:50.520
But yeah, the wholesome bonding, 100%.

39:50.520 --> 39:53.720
Yeah, I like, I love spending time every time.

39:53.720 --> 39:55.560
One of the girls left the call

39:55.560 --> 39:57.280
when we were like all like kind of trickling off

39:57.280 --> 39:59.160
to do our stuff that we had to get done,

39:59.160 --> 40:01.360
whether it be like audios, scripts or whatever.

40:01.360 --> 40:02.840
Smacked my hand on the table.

40:02.840 --> 40:04.320
I'm like, like I see left.

40:04.320 --> 40:06.040
I was like, I love that bear.

40:06.800 --> 40:07.640
And Mercy left.

40:07.640 --> 40:09.200
I'm like, I love that yandere.

40:10.960 --> 40:11.840
Amy left.

40:11.840 --> 40:13.880
I didn't say anything, but you guys know that I love her.

40:13.880 --> 40:15.680
I love that little pumpkin girl,

40:15.680 --> 40:17.360
that little hex maniac.

40:17.360 --> 40:18.520
Anyone idea what's gonna drop?

40:18.520 --> 40:19.360
Oh, I don't know.

40:19.360 --> 40:20.920
Emmy has a lot of projects going on right now.

40:20.920 --> 40:23.440
She's cooking up a bunch of stuff for you pin pals.

40:23.440 --> 40:28.440
So just wait, don't worry.

40:28.880 --> 40:30.960
But we both recorded it in like 10 minutes.

40:30.960 --> 40:33.760
So it's really, she has to edit and stuff.

40:33.760 --> 40:34.600
I asked her if she needed help.

40:34.600 --> 40:35.720
She says, she's like, oh, I'm just gonna edit.

40:35.720 --> 40:36.800
I'm like, okay.

40:36.800 --> 40:38.560
I kind of want to teach her to teach me how to edit

40:38.560 --> 40:40.400
and as well as Strani to teach me how to edit that stuff.

40:40.400 --> 40:44.280
Cause usually I just like send it off to the audio editor

40:44.280 --> 40:46.960
and then like insert all the like sound effects

40:46.960 --> 40:47.800
and all that stuff.

40:47.800 --> 40:49.360
It would be cool to like learn how to do that.

40:51.240 --> 40:54.080
But yeah, it was, it was really fun and it was funny.

40:54.080 --> 40:55.800
Like I would be using like my mommy voice.

40:55.800 --> 41:00.400
I'd be like, come on little girl and be like, hey.

41:00.400 --> 41:02.880
And she was like, it was really funny.

41:02.880 --> 41:05.560
And then when she was making like her portion

41:05.560 --> 41:06.760
that I'm not going to spoil.

41:06.760 --> 41:09.360
I was like screaming internally.

41:09.360 --> 41:10.640
So I hope you guys like it.

41:11.680 --> 41:12.520
But yeah.

41:13.480 --> 41:16.480
I hope you guys liked also the title of my stream,

41:19.480 --> 41:21.240
something simple, something giggle stick.

41:21.240 --> 41:22.200
I need to sneeze.

41:26.040 --> 41:26.880
Thank you.

41:27.960 --> 41:29.480
But yeah, it's really small and short,

41:29.480 --> 41:30.800
but I think you guys will like it.

41:30.800 --> 41:32.600
So short, sweet to the point.

41:35.560 --> 41:36.640
Thank you, thank you.

41:39.000 --> 41:42.920
But yeah, it means converting she be into someone.

41:44.440 --> 41:46.720
I think honestly, I think, yeah.

41:46.720 --> 41:49.880
I think I'm definitely being, I'm getting Emmy Pilled.

41:51.080 --> 41:53.440
Can my allergies have been acting up like for the past few days?

41:53.440 --> 41:55.240
I've been like sniffing a whole bunch.

41:59.040 --> 42:01.240
But yeah, I hope you guys shibbling.

42:02.240 --> 42:06.080
Don't get me started on the cotton bum family.

42:06.080 --> 42:08.080
I literally just did that off the rip, by the way.

42:08.080 --> 42:12.480
I don't even, I was possessed by some incestuous devil

42:12.480 --> 42:14.320
to just do all that random ass lore.

42:14.320 --> 42:16.520
I'm so sorry for some of you.

42:16.520 --> 42:18.800
I thought it was funny as hell.

42:18.800 --> 42:20.120
Based on yesterday's stream,

42:20.120 --> 42:22.600
I think Emmy fully converted you already 100%.

42:23.880 --> 42:25.520
Bro, imagine she being Emmy playing Kauffman,

42:25.520 --> 42:26.360
Andy and Lillie.

42:26.360 --> 42:27.200
That would be so funny.

42:27.200 --> 42:29.280
If we did a collab stream playing Kauffman,

42:29.360 --> 42:30.440
Andy and Lillie.

42:32.760 --> 42:37.000
And like I voiced Andy and she voices Ashley.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.080
I think that would be really, really funny

42:39.080 --> 42:41.080
before building that day was wild it was.

42:41.080 --> 42:44.560
But I just wanted to like do something kind of silly

42:44.560 --> 42:46.120
and kind of like ridiculous.

42:46.120 --> 42:50.360
Well, you guys literally watched me farm for four hours.

42:50.360 --> 42:53.120
Honestly, I don't even remember farming.

42:53.120 --> 42:54.720
I don't even, I generally don't even remember

42:54.720 --> 42:55.560
what I was doing.

42:55.560 --> 42:58.080
I just like shot a bird for four hours.

42:58.080 --> 42:59.800
I got four million runes.

43:00.640 --> 43:03.760
And yeah, and I just wanted you guys to laugh a bunch.

43:05.360 --> 43:06.760
Don't lie, you've been playing this lore

43:06.760 --> 43:07.840
since before your debut.

43:07.840 --> 43:09.520
No, I usually actually was like never really

43:09.520 --> 43:10.880
into that sort of stuff.

43:10.880 --> 43:12.320
But like I get the allure.

43:12.320 --> 43:15.320
Ha ha, ha ha, the V allure.

43:15.320 --> 43:16.400
So I'm like, you know what?

43:16.400 --> 43:18.480
Let me do a little treat for like the harem

43:18.480 --> 43:19.760
cause usually you don't get that from me.

43:19.760 --> 43:20.720
Let me do that.

43:20.720 --> 43:23.680
And you guys know like I love being cute and funny sometimes.

43:24.960 --> 43:27.040
Like it kind of like, I can like,

43:27.040 --> 43:28.760
I feel like I show a different side of myself

43:28.760 --> 43:31.680
when I get to be like shebethany and be cute and funny.

43:31.680 --> 43:34.040
And then when I'm sheby, I can be like, you know,

43:34.040 --> 43:36.040
my more like mommy adult self.

43:36.040 --> 43:38.760
Oh, and you know, it's very, it's always fun.

43:38.760 --> 43:40.040
I like, cause I, you guys know,

43:40.040 --> 43:41.800
I used to be cute and funny on the daily.

43:41.800 --> 43:43.680
So I'm at my PL.

43:43.680 --> 43:46.680
So it's, I kind of miss that sometimes.

43:46.680 --> 43:49.680
But I also just love being a big powerful woman

43:49.680 --> 43:51.080
with drill hair.

43:51.080 --> 43:52.680
Yeah.

43:52.680 --> 43:53.920
I think you're always cute and funny.

43:53.920 --> 43:55.520
Oh, thank you, so sweet.

43:57.280 --> 44:01.320
But yeah, I think I'm, I mean, I see they've got me.

44:01.320 --> 44:04.080
I'm like, oh man, I miss like that sort of stuff.

44:04.080 --> 44:05.840
I miss being a princess.

44:05.840 --> 44:07.040
And then Mercy makes me be like,

44:07.040 --> 44:08.840
oh, I miss being kind of yandere.

44:08.840 --> 44:10.760
But what I like about all of us is like,

44:10.760 --> 44:14.400
we don't feel like we all can like do each other's niches.

44:14.400 --> 44:16.120
Like, you know, like sometimes it means Dom,

44:16.120 --> 44:18.760
sometimes Mercy's Dom, sometimes it means yandere.

44:18.760 --> 44:21.800
Sometimes I see is like a little bit yandere.

44:21.800 --> 44:24.080
Sometimes Azura is more Dom.

44:24.080 --> 44:26.400
Like I remember Azura like said some like crazy stuff

44:26.400 --> 44:28.680
on my stream that was like very Dommy

44:28.680 --> 44:31.040
when during our collab stream with Emmy and Mercy.

44:31.040 --> 44:33.480
And I was like, excuse me.

44:33.480 --> 44:34.720
Sorry, I'm talking so fast, by the way.

44:34.720 --> 44:36.200
I think I had caffeine.

44:36.200 --> 44:38.360
So I'm like, I also feel really bad

44:38.360 --> 44:42.200
because I feel like I talked a lot during the,

44:42.200 --> 44:43.040
let me slow down.

44:44.560 --> 44:46.160
Deep breath, sheepie.

44:46.160 --> 44:49.920
I feel like I talked a lot during the collab.

44:49.920 --> 44:53.680
So I'm sorry if I like talked over your Oshii

44:53.800 --> 44:55.400
or what, then I'm sorry.

44:55.400 --> 44:57.080
Don't hurt me.

44:57.080 --> 44:57.920
Yep, God.

44:57.920 --> 44:58.760
Kicking in.

44:58.760 --> 44:59.600
Someone that will allow you,

44:59.600 --> 45:00.440
so it's not a human.

45:00.440 --> 45:01.280
I don't know guys, it's a human.

45:01.280 --> 45:02.120
I'm super human as well.

45:02.120 --> 45:04.800
I'm gonna get in, I'm gonna get in.

45:04.800 --> 45:07.920
All I see is the beginning of multiple personality disorder.

45:07.920 --> 45:09.560
It's gonna be great.

45:10.440 --> 45:11.720
Oh my God.

45:11.720 --> 45:14.440
Bunspeak, no, Bunspeak would be when I get a pyre.

45:14.440 --> 45:15.640
When I get a pyre, when I get like this,

45:15.640 --> 45:18.040
when I get Bunspeak, that's Bunspeak.

45:18.040 --> 45:21.000
That's when I get a mulliness and I sound really cute.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.560
What's next, loving girlfriend, Sheebie?

45:23.560 --> 45:26.760
You kind of already gotten that the past couple days.

45:26.760 --> 45:28.480
Oh my God, Eminem's a YouTuber now.

45:28.480 --> 45:30.240
Rap got Sheebie in the house, yeah.

45:32.600 --> 45:35.840
But yeah, you just carry the conversation.

45:35.840 --> 45:37.080
Yeah, sometimes I like,

45:37.080 --> 45:40.000
sometimes I have to tell myself if there's a silence,

45:40.000 --> 45:41.600
like I can be comfortable in the silence.

45:41.600 --> 45:44.000
Sometimes I feel like I need to fill a silence.

45:45.560 --> 45:47.120
Sheebie popping off today.

45:47.120 --> 45:50.800
I'm full of, I'm full of all the jokes, you know.

45:50.800 --> 45:52.640
Are you happy you're at 8K subscribers?

45:52.640 --> 45:54.440
Yes, it was such a pleasant surprise

45:54.440 --> 45:55.760
that I noticed that this morning,

45:55.760 --> 45:57.560
because only like yesterday or the day before,

45:57.560 --> 46:01.760
I was at 7.7, so that the clip,

46:01.760 --> 46:05.440
the debut stuff probably helped a lot in the collab stuff.

46:05.440 --> 46:08.200
So I'm glad that you guys like me and enjoy me.

46:08.200 --> 46:13.200
Like I said, and one of my goals was to get 10K subs,

46:13.240 --> 46:14.960
and I'm literally almost close to that,

46:14.960 --> 46:17.320
and it's surreal to me.

46:17.320 --> 46:20.320
Younger me would be confused, but proud

46:20.320 --> 46:22.560
of how I got 10K subs,

46:22.560 --> 46:25.480
because I've always wanted to be, you know,

46:25.480 --> 46:27.560
a YouTuber and stuff or a streamer,

46:27.560 --> 46:30.240
and my dreams are coming true.

46:30.240 --> 46:32.720
And I get to be a whore, like it's great.

46:33.800 --> 46:36.040
Affectionate, you know.

46:37.320 --> 46:38.640
But yeah, it'll be super cool.

46:38.640 --> 46:41.000
I'm trying to think of what to do for 10K.

46:41.000 --> 46:44.200
I think I was, I'm probably gonna do

46:44.200 --> 46:46.400
another hand cam for 10K.

46:48.080 --> 46:52.280
I was, or maybe like a hand cam ASMR,

46:52.480 --> 46:53.680
but that'd be cool.

46:53.680 --> 46:55.880
You guys can see the stupid shit that I do.

46:57.600 --> 46:59.640
But yeah, I prefer to give me ideas for 10K

46:59.640 --> 47:02.400
because I would love to celebrate that milestone with you,

47:02.400 --> 47:06.120
but I'm so very, very, very thankful for all of you.

47:06.120 --> 47:08.240
8K is a really big number to me,

47:09.320 --> 47:10.240
and I just can't wait.

47:10.240 --> 47:11.280
And it's funny, because like,

47:11.280 --> 47:12.600
Strawny's like, just you wait,

47:12.600 --> 47:16.400
just until you wait until I get you that 100K play button.

47:16.400 --> 47:18.640
And I'm like, oh, don't say that.

47:18.640 --> 47:21.960
Like, oh my God, like that just seems so surreal to me.

47:21.960 --> 47:24.600
And like, you're doing great, Shabrowski.

47:26.160 --> 47:28.040
You got to be a woe.

47:28.040 --> 47:29.000
What's a woe?

47:29.960 --> 47:30.800
Lovingly?

47:30.800 --> 47:31.640
Oh, a woe.

47:31.640 --> 47:32.480
Oh, I got you, me.

47:33.600 --> 47:35.240
Very funny.

47:35.240 --> 47:37.320
But yeah, and I'm proud of the other girls too.

47:37.320 --> 47:39.880
Like, I think Strawny is about to hit 10K

47:39.880 --> 47:41.160
or probably has hit 10K.

47:41.160 --> 47:44.360
I noticed it when me and Emmy were watching her stream

47:44.360 --> 47:48.600
and giggling like a bunch of maniacs that I was like,

47:48.600 --> 47:49.560
oh, she's at 9.9.

47:49.560 --> 47:51.560
So like, Strawny's about to hit 10K.

47:51.560 --> 47:53.640
Emmy is past 10K.

47:53.640 --> 47:55.800
Icy finally hit 10K, 6K.

47:55.800 --> 47:58.400
And I'm like, we're all growing at a steady pace.

47:58.400 --> 48:00.840
And I'm so proud of all of us in the hard work

48:00.840 --> 48:02.120
that we're all putting in.

48:02.120 --> 48:03.360
It really shows.

48:04.240 --> 48:06.520
And then again, the algorithm works in mysterious ways.

48:06.520 --> 48:10.640
So sometimes like, one of us lag behind,

48:10.640 --> 48:12.040
but we like make sure we lift each other up

48:12.040 --> 48:15.640
because like, I'll say it like, Corpo Unity,

48:15.640 --> 48:16.720
like we are unified.

48:16.720 --> 48:18.640
Like we want to support everyone.

48:18.640 --> 48:20.520
Strawny at 9.9, 4K.

48:20.520 --> 48:22.000
Oh, see, like very close.

48:22.000 --> 48:26.240
Like she'll probably hit 10K by the end of the night

48:26.240 --> 48:27.800
or like tomorrow.

48:27.800 --> 48:29.080
So I'm just really happy.

48:29.080 --> 48:31.320
I'm happy that Strawny's dream is coming true.

48:31.320 --> 48:36.320
She's giving us a platform to lift up smaller creators up.

48:38.080 --> 48:40.080
They usually wouldn't have certain opportunities

48:40.080 --> 48:42.440
and they're happening and it's great.

48:42.440 --> 48:44.520
Like she was telling us about other opportunities

48:44.520 --> 48:45.880
we might be able to have in the future.

48:45.880 --> 48:48.200
And I literally was like, what?

48:48.200 --> 48:50.240
Like we could have that.

48:50.240 --> 48:51.560
We could get this.

48:51.560 --> 48:53.880
Like, are you kidding me right now?

48:53.880 --> 48:55.120
Like what?

48:56.280 --> 48:58.640
Yeah, I'm so thankful for the girls.

48:58.640 --> 49:00.400
I'm so thankful for them.

49:00.400 --> 49:01.360
They're so wonderful.

49:01.360 --> 49:05.960
I was literally in college before everybody left.

49:05.960 --> 49:08.920
And I was like, can I just say, I love you all.

49:08.920 --> 49:11.440
And Mercy's just like, I love you too.

49:11.440 --> 49:14.320
And one, Mercy's a very lovey person.

49:14.320 --> 49:15.160
Oh my gosh.

49:15.800 --> 49:17.360
I walked away to use the bathroom,

49:17.360 --> 49:19.080
but I still had my headphones on.

49:19.080 --> 49:21.600
And it was, and then I think like Amy and Strawny

49:21.600 --> 49:24.360
also like stepped away to like get tea and stuff and water.

49:25.360 --> 49:30.040
And I'm like just like sitting on the toilet

49:30.040 --> 49:32.920
using the bathroom with my headphones on.

49:32.920 --> 49:36.080
And I just hear Mercy talking to Icy.

49:36.080 --> 49:39.240
And she's just like, hi, Icy.

49:39.240 --> 49:42.240
And Icy's like, hi.

49:42.440 --> 49:46.120
And then she's just like, I love you, Icy.

49:46.120 --> 49:49.000
And Icy's like, I love you too.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.840
And I'm just like laughing on the toilet

49:51.840 --> 49:53.880
because they're so fucking cute guys.

49:53.880 --> 49:55.280
I swear to God.

49:57.360 --> 50:00.520
But yes, like we all very much love each other.

50:00.520 --> 50:02.560
We're all very supportive of each other.

50:02.560 --> 50:03.400
And it's really cool.

50:03.400 --> 50:05.440
Like I was, I liked talking, cause I was talking to Amy.

50:05.440 --> 50:06.440
I'm like, oh, what'd you got going on?

50:06.440 --> 50:08.200
Like what do you want to, like projects you want to do?

50:08.200 --> 50:10.200
She was telling me and I'm like, aw, sick.

50:10.800 --> 50:12.840
And I love the opportunity.

50:12.840 --> 50:17.000
Like I always look forward to all of our collabs and stuff

50:17.000 --> 50:20.960
because I just, we're usually busy with our own like streams

50:20.960 --> 50:22.000
or like working on stuff.

50:22.000 --> 50:25.480
So it kind of stinks when we can't like sit

50:25.480 --> 50:26.880
and talk with each other.

50:26.880 --> 50:27.720
And I was kind of bummed

50:27.720 --> 50:29.800
cause like I know Azura had to stream afterwards.

50:29.800 --> 50:32.400
And I was like, I wanted to hang out with Azura too.

50:32.400 --> 50:34.160
I miss Azura.

50:34.160 --> 50:36.160
I miss Azura.

50:36.160 --> 50:38.320
I'm going to hang out with her

50:38.320 --> 50:40.320
and have her just make funny noises on call.

50:40.320 --> 50:41.240
Cause that's what she does.

50:41.240 --> 50:43.600
She just giggles and cackles and just goes,

50:43.600 --> 50:45.600
she's like, a little maniacal.

50:45.600 --> 50:46.600
I love her for that.

50:48.200 --> 50:51.480
Yeah, we got to hang out a lot, lots today.

50:51.480 --> 50:52.600
And it was really awesome.

50:52.600 --> 50:54.440
It was really great.

50:54.440 --> 50:55.280
I can't wait.

50:55.280 --> 50:56.120
We get to hang out.

50:56.120 --> 50:59.360
Well, technically we don't get to hang out tomorrow, sad.

50:59.360 --> 51:02.240
Cause we have the watch along, but like,

51:02.240 --> 51:04.360
I kind of want to like be in call with them.

51:04.360 --> 51:06.440
I'm going to ask actually, can we all be in call together

51:06.440 --> 51:07.280
and we do the watch alongs

51:07.280 --> 51:09.280
and I'll react at the same time.

51:09.280 --> 51:11.280
I think we are going to do that.

51:11.280 --> 51:12.200
I don't know.

51:12.200 --> 51:13.880
At last, cause that would be great.

51:15.040 --> 51:16.760
I'm still in call.

51:16.760 --> 51:17.600
Whoops.

51:19.880 --> 51:22.480
Let me just, I forgot I was still in call.

51:22.480 --> 51:24.880
Any one of them could have walked in and been like, hey.

51:26.160 --> 51:27.000
Oh.

51:30.440 --> 51:32.000
Yeah, we're already like trying to make plans

51:32.000 --> 51:33.600
to like see each other and stuff.

51:35.280 --> 51:36.120
A monthly Jen collab.

51:36.120 --> 51:36.960
Yeah.

51:36.960 --> 51:37.800
We try for, we aim for that.

51:37.800 --> 51:41.000
We try to aim for a month and then we might do

51:41.000 --> 51:42.280
of like all of us.

51:42.280 --> 51:44.400
And then like sometimes like, like me and Mercy

51:44.400 --> 51:46.080
just like kind of just like jumped in call together.

51:46.080 --> 51:48.880
Like we had a collab with other girls from mythos,

51:48.880 --> 51:50.600
but then we kind of hung out with each other.

51:50.600 --> 51:52.920
And then I did the same thing with Amy today.

51:52.920 --> 51:54.960
And like, I want to do that with Icy.

51:54.960 --> 51:55.800
And I want to do that.

51:55.800 --> 51:58.320
And I've done, I want to do that with Azura and Strani.

51:58.320 --> 51:59.920
Like I haven't even gotten into a collab with Strani yet.

51:59.920 --> 52:01.720
Like what the hell?

52:01.720 --> 52:05.400
But we all like definitely, like I'll just like wake up

52:05.400 --> 52:07.480
and look at our Discord chat.

52:07.480 --> 52:09.640
And yeah, Mercy collab's happening next week.

52:09.640 --> 52:10.480
Yes, yes, yes.

52:10.480 --> 52:11.680
We're playing Super Bunny Man.

52:13.040 --> 52:18.040
I look at my, the Discord general for our company.

52:18.920 --> 52:19.840
And it's just a bunch of us.

52:19.840 --> 52:21.120
We're all just like, I love you.

52:21.120 --> 52:21.960
I miss you.

52:21.960 --> 52:22.800
We're gonna hang out.

52:22.800 --> 52:23.640
I miss you guys.

52:23.640 --> 52:24.600
What are you guys doing today?

52:24.600 --> 52:25.440
What's going on?

52:25.440 --> 52:26.920
Oh, that's really tasty food you posted.

52:26.920 --> 52:27.760
Oh my God.

52:27.760 --> 52:28.600
Your cat's so cute.

52:28.600 --> 52:30.040
Like it's, it's great.

52:30.040 --> 52:31.480
We need the viewer house to be real.

52:31.480 --> 52:32.960
Imagine that would be so fun.

52:32.960 --> 52:34.600
Oh my God.

52:34.600 --> 52:35.360
Yeah.

52:35.360 --> 52:39.800
It's just like, it's really nice to be a part of something.

52:39.800 --> 52:41.920
And I didn't realize how much I wanted that.

52:41.920 --> 52:46.920
Cause like I went into a company wanting to grow as a creator.

52:48.680 --> 52:50.640
And I know, like I work well with others,

52:50.640 --> 52:54.760
but I didn't know I would be so devoted and dedicated

52:54.760 --> 52:56.520
to all the other girls.

52:56.520 --> 52:59.680
I was just like, okay, am I gonna see them as coworkers?

52:59.680 --> 53:01.240
And I'm like, no, I don't see them as coworkers.

53:01.240 --> 53:03.080
I see them as very close friends.

53:03.520 --> 53:06.600
Um, I know I'm bad when it comes to watching streams

53:06.600 --> 53:07.440
of all kinds of everyone,

53:07.440 --> 53:08.880
but generally I hope you all continue to grow and be happy.

53:08.880 --> 53:10.080
I think we will.

53:10.080 --> 53:11.200
And it's like, it's okay.

53:11.200 --> 53:13.760
You don't have to like, you do what you can.

53:13.760 --> 53:15.520
And we appreciate that.

53:15.520 --> 53:17.320
We appreciate all of that.

53:17.320 --> 53:19.600
How much do we need to donate to get the viewer house

53:19.600 --> 53:20.440
to become real?

53:20.440 --> 53:22.840
I think it would be way too much.

53:22.840 --> 53:26.120
Viewer house turned into a battlefield by the pets.

53:26.120 --> 53:27.080
Yeah, that's a good point.

53:27.080 --> 53:28.000
We all have pets.

53:28.000 --> 53:29.280
That'd be bad.

53:29.280 --> 53:31.600
My cats would probably eat in these rats.

53:33.760 --> 53:34.600
How are you doing?

53:34.600 --> 53:36.280
I'm glad I can see my favorite bunny waifu.

53:36.280 --> 53:38.000
Oh, thank you.

53:38.000 --> 53:39.360
Hello, I'm doing really great.

53:39.360 --> 53:40.840
I got to hang out with cute girls today

53:40.840 --> 53:42.720
and I got to look at really awesome designs.

53:42.720 --> 53:45.240
I really wish we could have done more.

53:45.240 --> 53:47.840
Yeah, it does feel great to feel like you belong somewhere.

53:47.840 --> 53:51.560
I've never like felt more meant to do something,

53:51.560 --> 53:52.680
to be honest with you.

53:52.680 --> 53:55.600
Like I am like, I am supposed to be here.

53:55.600 --> 53:57.480
I belong here.

53:57.480 --> 54:01.200
And like, I remember like hoping to the freaking universe

54:01.200 --> 54:05.240
I got into Veealer and because I'm like,

54:05.240 --> 54:07.640
I know I'm meant to be here.

54:07.640 --> 54:09.680
And that's why I recorded my audition video

54:09.680 --> 54:11.760
three days before auditions opened.

54:11.760 --> 54:13.880
And I thought of all the possible questions

54:13.880 --> 54:15.560
they may ask in the form so I could prepare

54:15.560 --> 54:17.480
and send it in as fast as possible.

54:17.480 --> 54:19.040
And that's why I was the first one

54:19.040 --> 54:21.080
to submit my audition to the Veealer.

54:24.080 --> 54:26.280
Veealer at her, so I need soundproofing in every room.

54:26.280 --> 54:27.440
You're so right though.

54:27.440 --> 54:29.880
Like all of us fucking just moaning.

54:29.880 --> 54:31.120
Hi, she being fellow harem.

54:31.120 --> 54:32.400
Hello.

54:32.400 --> 54:34.080
I do really hope you all get many,

54:34.080 --> 54:35.560
many years of streaming and growing.

54:35.560 --> 54:36.400
Me too.

54:36.400 --> 54:37.840
Like I am only thinking like,

54:37.840 --> 54:39.960
this is only like the second month guys.

54:39.960 --> 54:41.640
Like we're halfway through the second month

54:41.640 --> 54:46.240
and I can't believe how much has happened and changed.

54:46.240 --> 54:48.360
And it's all thanks to you guys.

54:48.360 --> 54:50.160
Like what the heck?

54:50.160 --> 54:51.240
My God.

54:51.240 --> 54:55.160
But do you also belong to the October series?

54:55.160 --> 54:56.000
No.

54:58.000 --> 54:58.840
Oh.

55:00.360 --> 55:02.120
Hi, hi, everybody coming in.

55:02.120 --> 55:04.400
I was never into VTubers much

55:04.400 --> 55:06.120
until I saw all of your debuts last month.

55:06.120 --> 55:07.640
But now I'm glad I came and stayed.

55:07.640 --> 55:09.800
I've had more laughs recently than I had in a while.

55:09.800 --> 55:12.560
I'm so glad that all we want to do is make you laugh

55:12.560 --> 55:13.400
and coom.

55:14.280 --> 55:16.280
I love you and all of you are giggle sticks.

55:16.280 --> 55:17.560
I think if I ever,

55:17.560 --> 55:19.720
I think I'm gonna call it that from now on.

55:21.600 --> 55:24.360
No, wait, no, but I really like the idea of Bible.

55:24.360 --> 55:27.440
But giggle sticks is funny too.

55:27.440 --> 55:29.640
I just think it's so funny.

55:30.120 --> 55:30.960
That that happened.

55:30.960 --> 55:32.640
Hold on, let me see.

55:32.640 --> 55:33.480
Oopsies.

55:33.480 --> 55:35.400
I didn't mean to go into the freaking,

55:36.600 --> 55:38.200
I didn't mean to join another call.

55:40.920 --> 55:45.040
Oh, my manager sent me my thumbnails for the month

55:45.040 --> 55:46.400
and I'm like awkward

55:46.400 --> 55:49.840
because we're doing a Twilight watch along next week.

55:49.840 --> 55:54.040
And it's funny because it's just like me as like Bella

55:54.040 --> 55:55.880
next to day, next to Edward.

55:55.880 --> 55:59.880
Oh, so funny.

56:01.720 --> 56:03.520
Well, as Vod say, oh, the Vod staying up.

56:03.520 --> 56:05.800
I was kind of like talking to Emmy

56:05.800 --> 56:07.400
and Emmy was kind of explaining to me

56:07.400 --> 56:09.560
how like Vod limited stuff works

56:09.560 --> 56:10.720
and she was kind of like showing me.

56:10.720 --> 56:12.760
And I'm like, it's not,

56:12.760 --> 56:15.960
as long as I don't get a strike, I think it's fine.

56:15.960 --> 56:17.880
So I'm like, you know what, it's funny.

56:17.880 --> 56:19.280
It's hilarious.

56:19.280 --> 56:20.360
I'm leaving it up.

56:22.160 --> 56:23.720
I'm glad you found something that was meant for you.

56:23.720 --> 56:24.680
I know what I'm after.

56:24.680 --> 56:25.720
There's some obstacles in between.

56:25.720 --> 56:27.160
And for that, I hope to find something that clicks

56:27.160 --> 56:28.240
like you did with the other.

56:28.240 --> 56:30.440
Yeah, like it took some effort to get here.

56:30.440 --> 56:33.480
Like I had to stream, I had to prove my worth.

56:33.480 --> 56:37.400
You don't like, some companies will say like,

56:37.400 --> 56:39.480
oh, you don't need any prior streaming service,

56:39.480 --> 56:42.080
like experience, but you really do.

56:42.080 --> 56:44.960
And so it is really recommended.

56:44.960 --> 56:46.920
If you want to become a VTuber

56:46.920 --> 56:48.760
and you want to join a company,

56:48.760 --> 56:50.080
please stream for a little bit

56:50.080 --> 56:52.600
because you might find out you don't like it

56:52.600 --> 56:54.280
or it might not fit into your schedule

56:54.320 --> 56:55.520
or it's not the type of lifestyle.

56:55.520 --> 56:59.360
You might not be used to the hate or the positivity.

56:59.360 --> 57:02.920
Like, you know, oh, thank you, Paul for the 10 gifted.

57:02.920 --> 57:03.760
Thank you.

57:03.760 --> 57:04.600
What the heck?

57:06.120 --> 57:09.200
My gosh, I'll forgive the Bible.

57:09.200 --> 57:10.520
The script master should release a new

57:10.520 --> 57:11.920
English translation of the Bible.

57:11.920 --> 57:13.000
I agree with that.

57:13.000 --> 57:13.840
Thank you so much.

57:13.840 --> 57:14.880
You're so sweet.

57:14.880 --> 57:16.240
Team Edward or Team Jacob?

57:16.240 --> 57:18.040
Team Jacob.

57:20.080 --> 57:21.080
Team Jacob.

57:22.080 --> 57:25.280
Celebratory pod keeping gifts.

57:28.040 --> 57:30.360
Oh, mad I'm putting in that work in a show.

57:30.360 --> 57:31.320
It deserves success.

57:31.320 --> 57:32.160
Thank you.

57:32.160 --> 57:33.000
Thank you.

57:33.000 --> 57:35.960
And I'm happy you guys are enjoying the work that I put in.

57:35.960 --> 57:38.160
Should be the trolley deserve better into, oh, 100%.

57:38.160 --> 57:39.240
Trolley deserve way better.

57:39.240 --> 57:40.760
Are you kidding me?

57:40.760 --> 57:42.640
I would hate my child if my child was, you know,

57:42.640 --> 57:44.160
whatever that happened.

57:44.160 --> 57:45.640
All that jazz.

57:46.840 --> 57:48.840
What's a giggle stick?

57:48.840 --> 57:51.960
I want you to look down in between your legs.

57:53.960 --> 57:56.000
Um, and yet I guess, oh no.

57:56.000 --> 57:59.360
We got touched again, bro.

57:59.360 --> 58:03.960
Oh, we all know why Team Jacob don't look at me like that.

58:04.800 --> 58:07.160
Shibi, can I ask the reason for why we can't give

58:07.160 --> 58:08.680
the full memberships to the girls

58:08.680 --> 58:10.520
and instead only the emotes here?

58:12.440 --> 58:13.640
I, to be honest with you, again,

58:13.640 --> 58:15.960
I'm not super familiar with YouTube,

58:15.960 --> 58:20.960
but I think the idea is that only really dedicated people

58:25.200 --> 58:28.920
will want to spend time with you in the membership streams

58:28.920 --> 58:30.880
and they're the ones who watch all your streams

58:30.880 --> 58:31.800
and know what you're about.

58:31.800 --> 58:34.760
If kind of like anybody went into a membership stream

58:34.760 --> 58:36.400
and they're kind of like, I don't know, like normie,

58:36.400 --> 58:38.280
then they might like kind of be off put,

58:38.280 --> 58:40.760
but like for example, like my tag stream,

58:40.760 --> 58:44.360
a lot of people were thrown off by that.

58:44.360 --> 58:47.440
And oh my God, no, it is still got missed, bro.

58:49.080 --> 58:50.480
Thank you for the other.

58:50.480 --> 58:52.200
Oh my God, what?

58:53.120 --> 58:57.000
Thank you for the other 20 and another 20 by 30 to you, Paul.

58:57.000 --> 58:58.840
Oh my God.

58:58.840 --> 59:01.320
All right, here are my little PogChamp.

59:03.240 --> 59:04.200
Shibi likes furries.

59:04.200 --> 59:05.040
No, I don't.

59:07.080 --> 59:08.720
Damn.

59:08.720 --> 59:12.320
But I think, yeah, it basically makes it

59:12.320 --> 59:14.760
so you do have to spend at least some money to attend.

59:14.760 --> 59:16.040
Gifts still give you a nice discount.

59:16.040 --> 59:18.920
Yeah, like you just pay the remainder.

59:20.720 --> 59:21.960
But yeah.

59:21.960 --> 59:23.800
Oh my God, why are you guys so nice today?

59:23.800 --> 59:28.800
Thank you for the 10 gifts, what the hell, guys?

59:28.840 --> 59:32.320
Oh, they're like really trying to help that bro out.

59:32.320 --> 59:34.080
I want to see, did he get it?

59:34.080 --> 59:35.360
Oh my God, he did it!

59:39.080 --> 59:42.080
Bro, your settings must be off.

59:42.080 --> 59:44.560
There can be no way.

59:44.560 --> 59:46.920
There can be no way, you must have settings off

59:46.920 --> 59:49.240
so you can't get this gifted.

59:52.360 --> 59:53.200
Dodged.

59:54.400 --> 59:55.480
Just a running gag.

59:55.480 --> 59:58.800
There's always one person that just misses it.

59:58.800 --> 59:59.640
Where's mine?

59:59.640 --> 01:00:01.320
You have one, it's right there.

01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:06.920
Oh, you guys are so nice.

01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:09.400
You're like, let's get all green in here.

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:10.240
Or is a brand account?

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:12.520
That's a good point, it could be a brand account.

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:16.280
She be punishing me lovingly, thank you.

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:19.920
Punch the mic, punch the mic, punch the mic, punch the mic.

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:21.920
I think that's gonna be a bit now.

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:22.760
Sorry.

01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:25.960
See, I'm punishing you lovingly.

01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:28.160
That's loving, me punching you.

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:30.520
One day it'll work, what's a brand account?

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:31.360
I don't...

01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:36.040
All right, round three.

01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:37.840
Third time's a charm, thank you Paul.

01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:46.080
I wanna see, I wanna see, is it gonna work?

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:47.560
Come on, speak.

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:53.840
The punches of love, oh no.

01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:58.840
No, no, oh brother.

01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:04.640
It's so shib over.

01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:06.920
You probably only have to worry about the brand account thing

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:09.880
if your account is really old, that's a good point.

01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:12.760
Okay guys, stop for real.

01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:14.480
You gotta need to calm down.

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:20.400
Someone just paypal my bro like five bucks

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:21.600
and call it a day.

01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:24.520
I'm getting soaked, oh.

01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:28.480
Punch the mic, punch the mic, punch the mic.

01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:29.320
No.

01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:32.480
Oh my.

01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:37.440
It doesn't end, okay.

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:39.840
You poor thing.

01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:42.840
All right, chat, I'm taking you close to my chest.

01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:46.800
I love you guys so much.

01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:49.600
It's got you, your luck is just not good.

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:55.600
As I'm giving you a kiss, mwah, mwah.

01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:58.000
Oh my god, okay.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.720
Is this a game to you guys?

01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:00.560
Oh my god.

01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:01.520
Mwah.

01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:09.200
Guys, guys, calm, the ward is, did he get it?

01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:13.280
No, he still did.

01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:17.480
Guys, this is, stop, stop, stop, stop.

01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:19.640
The gacha needs to end, guys, stop.

01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:21.240
Thank you, thank you.

01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:22.920
On a gorilla stream.

01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:26.240
Oh my god, thank you, hold on.

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:27.200
Let me say thank you.

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:29.120
Thank you, viewer lover.

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:31.160
Thank you, dragon and Dante.

01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:34.320
And Dante, dragon and Dante.

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:35.560
Thank you, Paul, again.

01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:37.000
Thank you, Joker.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.360
Thank you, average amphibian.

01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:39.640
You're not average.

01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:40.600
You're great.

01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:41.920
Thank you, Ken, at 30.

01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:45.840
Oh my god.

01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:49.000
You could be a lucky recipient

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.040
of a Shippee-Kan-Wambiola membership.

01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:54.620
Oh my goodness.

01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:58.080
Oh my god.

01:02:58.080 --> 01:02:59.480
Thank you, Usmami.

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:02.040
Next one.

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:04.960
Next one, did he get it?

01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:09.400
Did he, no, no.

01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:11.520
No.

01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:15.920
I think it's an ultra rare, apparently I'm not eligible.

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:18.080
Okay, that explains a lot then.

01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:22.040
Oh no, oh guys, see that's why I told you to stop

01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:25.080
because I'm like, there's probably something else going on.

01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:27.720
That's preventing him from getting one.

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:29.760
He must have a brand account then.

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:33.200
Oh, it was rigged from the start, guys.

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:36.040
No, you tried.

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:37.840
Thank you for the gifted.

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:40.840
That's why I was like, stop, stop.

01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:41.680
Oh.

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:47.400
But congrats to everybody else who got gifted stuff

01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:48.640
and now you can have my emotes.

01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:51.580
My other emotes should be done at some point very soon.

01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:55.320
Oh, the brand account debuff is real.

01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:57.160
Thank you again, Joker.

01:03:57.160 --> 01:03:59.160
You guys are absurd.

01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:01.320
I guess this is like, you guys paying me

01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:04.160
for the silly script that I read for you.

01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:05.920
I'll have to split these with Emmy.

01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:10.280
I'll be like, throw some money at her.

01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:13.160
Just be like, there's your cut.

01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:18.880
Yeah, you'd have to make a whole new account.

01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:20.520
I don't care if I'm actually not eligible.

01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:24.040
Oh, but you should probably get that checked out, bro.

01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:26.500
And you get access to member streams, yes.

01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:30.520
And then I have an archive karaoke

01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:35.400
and when I come back from my vacation,

01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:37.360
from the 18th to the 23rd,

01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:41.200
and then we have a watch along on Monday.

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:42.040
What's the day?

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:42.880
Today's Saturday.

01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:47.960
I have to go to my parents' house tomorrow.

01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:49.000
So I get a suitcase,

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.800
because I forgot I don't have a suitcase.

01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:54.000
Ooh, I got a sub, but doesn't tell me from who.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.440
Yeah, say, make sure you say thank you.

01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:56.840
Say thank you.

01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:59.960
Thank you, everybody.

01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:03.880
You will be green in madam's presence.

01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:06.520
I was like, next time drinking is right.

01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:08.040
Like if you don't, yeah, they're just emotes.

01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:10.960
If you want to get an actual, you have to upgrade.

01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:13.280
Oh my God.

01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:14.440
Sorry, it's your favorite character.

01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:15.920
My cat's food going off.

01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:19.840
The gray harlot is still valid.

01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:21.200
You're still appreciated and loved.

01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:22.720
You still show up to my streams.

01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:23.960
I still appreciate you.

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:26.560
As well as the Lurkers.

01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:32.280
But yeah, we did a really fun tag list.

01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:34.080
We watched Sucker Punch the other day.

01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:35.360
It was really fun.

01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:39.120
Yeah, so it's only a couple bucks.

01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:41.360
I feel like I'm like shilling myself.

01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:44.720
Check out my Patreon in the description below.

01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:47.120
Check out Emmys' Patreon in the description below.

01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:48.720
We'll actually go to her.

01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:50.120
I don't think I have her Patreon

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:51.720
or any of the other girls' Patreon.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.400
Um, go to her channel.

01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:56.520
Stop to her Patreon.

01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:58.000
That's all I'm gonna say.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.160
I was once a gray harlot too, long time ago.

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:05.360
You were like, they were gray like five minutes ago.

01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:08.000
My cats are eating.

01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:09.840
Alphia is eating.

01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:11.400
Hi, Pia.

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:12.560
Raina is asleep.

01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:15.080
Raina is knocked out on the chair.

01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:16.160
Raina, are you good?

01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:18.720
Raina.

01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:21.920
Raina, what are you doing?

01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:23.000
Oh, you're licking your paws.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:23.840
Okay, sorry.

01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:26.480
And Boomi is knocked out on the cat tree.

01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:27.320
He has passed out.

01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:28.240
My little handsome man.

01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:29.680
All his paws are all together.

01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:30.520
He's very cute.

01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:33.640
Just checking you're still streaming longer.

01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:37.480
I don't know.

01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:38.600
I was just talking.

01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:41.280
I guess I'll stream longer.

01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:42.200
It's only the least I can do

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:44.000
after getting a bazillion freaking gifted.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:44.840
So yeah.

01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:47.120
Where's Yappin?

01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:48.320
Where Yappin?

01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:50.800
You remember dogs and lizards over cats or reptiles?

01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:51.640
Do I redirect her to you?

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:53.840
Yes, mom, you can.

01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:59.480
Strani, I definitely recommend that you watch this VOD,

01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:00.320
by the way.

01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:06.320
At least like the first like 30 minutes to an hour

01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:07.680
or like go through it

01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:09.920
because you'll laugh because of me

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:11.760
and Amy did something funny.

01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:12.600
Amy was on my stream.

01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:15.600
Oh, thank you for the gift and Mr. Black's silence.

01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:18.360
I've gifted Mr. Black's silence.

01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:20.800
26, whose name makes me crack up every time I see it.

01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:24.800
Well, I leave for 10 minutes and so many gifted.

01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:26.000
Yeah.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.800
People were trying to hit this one dude

01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:30.920
with a gifted membership, but he moans

01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:33.840
and then I think he just doesn't, he's a brand account.

01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:34.680
Oh my God.

01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:37.800
Very silly.

01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:39.560
Okay, where is,

01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:40.840
I feel like I need to make myself a little bit bigger.

01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:42.200
I'm a little bit far away.

01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:44.160
Let me get up close and personal.

01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:46.920
With y'all.

01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:48.400
Hi, welcome to my room.

01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:51.800
Yes, I wear a sign on my shirt because YouTube hates me.

01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:53.760
You know what? It's coming off.

01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:56.440
A limiter coming off.

01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:02.440
Everybody gets to see.

01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:05.320
I'm not ashamed of myself anymore.

01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:09.920
I am here to stay.

01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:13.640
Imagine if I was flat, Tristan.

01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:14.720
That'd just be weird.

01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:20.160
But what if the justice,

01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:21.960
I forgot to put my ooo-oo mouth on.

01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:25.920
Wait, where'd my track go?

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:27.720
I want to see what you guys are saying.

01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:30.960
She be on these.

01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:33.720
YouTube hates body positivity.

01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:37.280
I know, imagine my video just like disappears.

01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:39.620
Cutting bird.

01:08:39.620 --> 01:08:41.120
Well, I could take them off.

01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:44.720
Actually, let me see if I can do that.

01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:48.160
I think I could take them off.

01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:49.560
Can I take them off my boobs?

01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:53.160
I feel like this is a bad idea for me to try,

01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:54.560
just like I did when I accidentally was changing

01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:56.320
my skin color on stream.

01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:59.000
Let's not do that.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.360
Let's not do that.

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:06.960
I would, so I wouldn't remove that.

01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:11.200
Like I wouldn't, it just,

01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:13.040
I would just make myself transparent.

01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:14.080
They would just be transparent.

01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:16.120
So you guys would be able to see through me.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.400
Shawty, Mama Raid.

01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:21.800
Hello.

01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:24.240
I hope you have your giggle sticks ready.

01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:26.720
Cause we're about to shlorp, shlorp.

01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:27.560
I'm sorry.

01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:32.600
Oh my God, my headphones are dying.

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:34.040
Hi, writers.

01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:37.560
Hello, Raiders.

01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:39.000
Welcome in.

01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:43.160
I have no idea where you guys are up through this stream.

01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:45.000
You'll laugh really hard, mom.

01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:47.680
You'll laugh really hard, Shawty.

01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:49.640
If you watched like the first hour of it,

01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:50.960
or a little bit less.

01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:53.320
Is this the R greeting session?

01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:58.560
We might have read the first script

01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:01.920
and heavily censored it because of how silly it was.

01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:04.360
Herm.

01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:05.240
Did she win?

01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:06.840
Was she winning?

01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:08.440
Was she winning, Riftlands?

01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:09.960
Did she win Baltaro?

01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:12.480
Baltaro?

01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:13.720
Was she winning?

01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:15.400
Strony equals Shibi's top?

01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:16.240
What?

01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:18.680
I don't know.

01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:20.160
Honestly, I don't know the power dynamic

01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:21.520
between me and Strony.

01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:24.120
Oh my God, here we go again.

01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:27.160
Thank you a third of the time he gifted.

01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:28.800
Jesus Christ.

01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:30.560
He did so great.

01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:31.400
I'm glad.

01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:34.560
Remember to like and subscribe.

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:36.680

01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:38.280
Oh yeah, like and subscribe.

01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:39.600

01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:41.640

01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:43.880
Don't forget to like, comment and subscribe.

01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:46.880
On any of our VODs and streams,

01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:50.760
just like at Strony's.

01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:54.320
I can't even talk because people won't stop gifting.

01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:56.880
Guys, relax.

01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:01.920
Thank you to X2Doki for the 10 gifted.

01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:03.320
My God.

01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:06.240
The gotcha must flow.

01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:07.680
It's literally like just like pull

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:08.520
and hope that you win.

01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:09.360
Oh my.

01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:13.560
Thank you for the 20 gifted Paul, but yeah.

01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:14.880
Oh my God.

01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:18.640
I'm so good at dodging.

01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:19.640
You're good at dodging too.

01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:21.520
Everybody's dodging.

01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:23.000
Everybody's taught like all my Lakers

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.760
are poking popping up like did I win?

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.560
Hopefully.

01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:31.360
Guys, at this rate, I'm going to literally

01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:36.400
have only greenies.

01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:38.120
No harlot left behind.

01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:41.240
Yeah, everybody should be able to use the emotes.

01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:44.640
Oh, you guys are so sweet.

01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:46.440
I'm pretty sure I can get gifted membership.

01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:47.520
It's just my luck, I guess.

01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:50.240
It is very, very odd.

01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:52.800
You know what?

01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:54.640
I honestly don't care about getting a membership.

01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:57.440
I'm just happy to support a Vtuber I like watching.

01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:00.920
I don't even need a Vtuber.

01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:03.480
Whatever guys, I don't need a membership from you guys.

01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:04.320
Whatever.

01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:08.480
No, but you're right.

01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:11.000
I still appreciate you even if your name is gray,

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.160
even if you're a Laker,

01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:15.080
as long as you watch and support me and the girls,

01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:16.800
that's all that really matters.

01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:17.800
Thank you.

01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:21.040
Thank you, Average and Phibian.

01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:23.080
Is this going to be a stream of me just saying thank you

01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:24.240
for all the gifted?

01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:27.280
Thank you, Average and Phibian for the 10 gifted.

01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:29.120
Believe me more.

01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:32.920
Plop, plop, plop, good gifted, good gifted, good gifted.

01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:35.760
Sundare Chat, Sundare Streamer, it works.

01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:39.520
Maybe I don't want a cool sticker.

01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:41.400
Maybe I don't want a cool sticker.

01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:43.040
Maybe I just want to be plain.

01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:47.280
If it is when I'm out of here,

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:48.120
what do you mean?

01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:48.960
Where are you going?

01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:49.920
Get the fuck back here.

01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:51.520
You don't get to leave.

01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:52.720
You thought you could leave.

01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:55.000
You thought you could leave.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:55.840
You don't get to go.

01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:57.320
Oh, wait, guys, I've,

01:12:57.320 --> 01:12:58.920
since there's a lot of you here.

01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:05.920
Jay Santorillo.

01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:12.920
Hey, welcome to the members, the members here.

01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:18.920
Do you like my reverb?

01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:24.920
Should we, should we start singing songs?

01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:30.920
Hold on.

01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:31.920
Where's my,

01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:33.920
can I put on the cute and funny?

01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:36.920
Hi, everybody.

01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:39.920
It's me, British Stevie, once more.

01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:40.920
Hello.

01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:44.920
Thank you so much for all of the gifted subs.

01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:46.920
You are also very sweet.

01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:48.920
I appreciate you so much.

01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:52.920
You've been reverbed.

01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:55.920
Get reverbed, get reverbed, get reverbed.

01:13:56.920 --> 01:13:58.920
As long as you don't start singing

01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:01.920
the Darren Waller classic Cook On Shibs.

01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:04.920
Oh, I'm Jeet Shibathani.

01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:05.920
Hi, yes.

01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:07.920
I'm Shibathani's British sister.

01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:10.920
I'm not the older one that's in Britain.

01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:12.920
I'm the younger one that's in Britain.

01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:14.920
The older one sounds like this.

01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:16.920
She talks like this.

01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:20.920
Yeah.

01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:21.920
Well, go on, Solar.

01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:23.920
I never stopped working.

01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:24.920
Let's see.

01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:25.920
Let me think of a song to sing.

01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:27.920
I need to put in my right headphones for this

01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:29.920
because I'm using my different headphones.

01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:32.920
I need to put in my IEMs for this.

01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:36.920
Doing your shit, Britannia.

01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:40.920
Oh, my God.

01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:42.920
This fucking echo.

01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:44.920
Echo, echo.

01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:50.920
Sing me a song.

01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:51.920
Wait, what's that song?

01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:53.920
Let me take the echo down.

01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:55.920
What's the viewer about?

01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:58.920
Oh, Misty.

01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:00.920
Whoa, my voice cracked.

01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:10.920
How I just hurt my mouth.

01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:13.920
It's like bumped my straw against my gum.

01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:14.920
Ow.

01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:16.920
Hi, Boomi.

01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:18.920
Oh, thank you for that.

01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:21.920
I was just a gifted because I'm so used to saying gifted.

01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:23.920
The gifted, the gifted.

01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:26.920
Boomi, why are you going in the box?

01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:28.920
A viewer lover.

01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:29.920
Thank you for the $5.

01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:32.920
Dr. P, thank you for the 10 gift.

01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:33.920
Guys.

01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:37.920
You're absolutely fucking going bonkers right now.

01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:40.920
How I'm the grafted.

01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:46.920
Oh, my God.

01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:47.920
It will never stop.

01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:50.920
It's just going to be a constant stream.

01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:52.920
Get spoiled.

01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:53.920
Get spoiled.

01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:55.920
God, I don't deserve this.

01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:56.920
I don't deserve this.

01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:57.920
Stop it.

01:15:57.920 --> 01:15:58.920
Okay.

01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:00.920
This song.

01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:01.920
Hold on.

01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:03.920
I need to look at the lyrics.

01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:04.920
It goes out to Strawny.

01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:05.920
I want to do this.

01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:09.920
I want to, uh, I want to clap on this song with her.

01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:19.920
I'm not going to put the music because then everything will just get claimed.

01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:27.920
Oh, misty high up the mountain below.

01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:29.920
Keep careful.

01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:33.920
Watch off my brother's soul.

01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:41.920
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke.

01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:46.920
Keep watching over do more in the sun.

01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:57.920
If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together.

01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:03.920
Watch the flames cry high into the night.

01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:06.920
Calling out father home.

01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:15.920
Stand by and we will watch the flames burn hot burn on the mountain side.

01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:21.920
I can't sing that well.

01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:23.920
I'm sorry.

01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:24.920
Strawny did it.

01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:26.920
Wait, I wasn't looking at my chat.

01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:27.920
I was looking at the lyrics.

01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:29.920
Did Strawny just give fire?

01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:32.920
Why did you give fire?

01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:40.920
Thank you, Strawny.

01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:42.920
Oh my God.

01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:43.920
Oh my God.

01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:44.920
Oh my God.

01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:46.920
I'm living in a freaking cry at this rate.

01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:50.920
So you guys are too good to me.

01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:53.920
Strawny, do you want to collab with me on this song?

01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:57.920
I think we could do a really good job.

01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:00.920
And then later she's like, that'll be coming out of your paycheck.

01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:03.920
No kidding.

01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:08.920
This really is a member song.

01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:09.920
I can't sing.

01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:11.920
RIP broke my vocal cords.

01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:13.920
We can like throw some auto tune on it.

01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:15.920
Honestly, I love your memer song.

01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:17.920
I'm just a memer.

01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:20.920
Oh my God.

01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:23.920
Thank you, Mr. Black.

01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:25.920
I love fire.

01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:28.920
I imagine, because you mentioned when you get rated,

01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:35.920
I'm like minus $25 for kids.

01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:37.920
Oh my goodness.

01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:39.920
Yeah, that doesn't mean you can't.

01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:40.920
It doesn't mean you shouldn't.

01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:43.920
Exactly.

01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:48.920
I just love Ed Sheeran's voice in that.

01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:50.920
Waiting for the one person to drop 50 gifted.

01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:52.920
No.

01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:55.920
Stop it.

01:18:55.920 --> 01:18:59.920
Get your hand away from that freaking button.

01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:00.920
She does have a good voice.

01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:03.920
I don't know what she's talking about.

01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:05.920
Stop it.

01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:06.920
Get some help.

01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:08.920
Okay.

01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:11.920
I'm not going to sing the whole song.

01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:13.920
That's a little test.

01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:16.920
Don't tempt fate.

01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:18.920
Are the gifted part of my allowance?

01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:19.920
Yes.

01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:20.920
Sing yellow.

01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:21.920
Oh, I like yellow.

01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:22.920
Yeah.

01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:25.920
And it was all yellow.

01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:27.920
Yellow.

01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:32.920
But I can't play.

01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:35.920
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:38.920
It's a little bit too much.

01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:42.920
I go more reverbs so I sound more ethical.

01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:45.920
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:46.920
Okay, sorry.

01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:48.920
Whoa.

01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:52.920
Oh, I knocked something over my desk.

01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:56.920
Look at the stars.

01:19:56.920 --> 01:20:00.920
Look at the skies.

01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:07.320
I'll put some autotune on and see if that helps me a little bit usually the autotune just actually makes my stuff worse

01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:13.040
That's me see I

You guys think I know more songs than I actually do. I'm not that cultureed

Calculate. I know I'm like, let me not talk to myself. I think it ended on

Perfect note. Okay. Um, let's see. Let's see. Somebody said one that I liked

01:56:26.960 --> 01:56:30.000

Yeah, boomies boomies chillin

01:58:02.080 --> 01:58:04.080
That's a weird thing to say

01:58:15.040 --> 01:58:23.120
Do you ever feel like a plastic bag drifting through the wind wanting to start again

01:58:23.840 --> 01:58:30.880
Do you ever feel feel so paper thin like a house of cards when blown from caving in

01:58:31.600 --> 01:58:38.640
Do you ever feel already buried deep six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing

01:58:38.880 --> 01:58:40.880
Oh, yeah, I forgot my phone

01:58:40.960 --> 01:58:42.960
There's still a chance for you

01:58:43.520 --> 01:58:46.800
It's working here. You just gotta ignite

01:58:49.440 --> 01:58:52.080
I'm not hold on. I need to start over when we just hopped on my desk again

01:58:53.760 --> 01:58:56.960
Hold on. I'm gonna do better. Hold on. I promise you. I'm better. I'm better than this

01:58:58.800 --> 01:59:00.800
The voice crack though

01:59:01.040 --> 01:59:03.040
You just gotta ignite

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
Oh

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
They let it shine

01:59:09.680 --> 01:59:12.160
Just on the night

01:59:13.280 --> 01:59:16.160
Like the fourth of july

01:59:16.800 --> 01:59:20.160

You're gonna leave him all in ha ha ha

01:59:48.720 --> 01:59:51.920
Your singing is too good for autotune. I know the autotune is not working properly

01:59:53.200 --> 01:59:55.200
It's not gonna be too good though

01:59:55.200 --> 02:00:00.560
Cannot be replaced if you only knew what the future holds

02:00:01.040 --> 02:00:03.840
After her dream comes around. Oh my god, boonie, please

02:00:04.800 --> 02:00:06.800
He keeps hopping on my desk

Over the leaves you to the perfect room

02:00:12.640 --> 02:00:14.640
Like the lightning bolt

02:00:14.800 --> 02:00:16.560
Your heart will grow

02:00:16.560 --> 02:00:20.240
And when it's I turn off autotune, you'll know you just gotta ignite

02:00:21.280 --> 02:00:23.280
The light

02:00:23.280 --> 02:00:25.760
It let it shine

02:00:27.120 --> 02:00:29.680
Just on the night

02:00:30.720 --> 02:00:33.680
Like the fourth of july

02:00:34.080 --> 02:00:37.680
Cause baby you're a firework

02:00:38.240 --> 02:00:40.640
Come on show him why

02:00:40.640 --> 02:00:42.160
You're worth

02:00:42.160 --> 02:00:44.160
Make him go ha ha ha

02:00:45.440 --> 02:00:47.440
As you shoot across the sky

02:00:49.840 --> 02:00:53.040
Baby you're a firework

02:00:53.680 --> 02:00:57.040
Come on let your colors burst

02:07:09.280 --> 02:07:11.280
Which is

02:07:11.280 --> 02:07:13.280
I'm stunlock and she hasn't even used the taser

02:07:13.280 --> 02:07:15.280
I'll do take on me

02:07:15.280 --> 02:07:17.280
Did somebody say

02:07:17.280 --> 02:07:19.280
What does taser sound like

02:07:19.280 --> 02:07:21.280
With reverb

02:07:21.280 --> 02:07:23.280
Ow that hurt my ears

02:07:23.280 --> 02:07:25.280
Ow that hurt my ears

02:07:25.280 --> 02:07:27.280
Ow that hurt my ears

02:07:27.280 --> 02:07:29.280
Ow that hurt my ears

02:07:29.280 --> 02:07:31.280
Ow that hurt my ears

02:07:31.280 --> 02:07:33.280
Ow that does not sound good

02:07:33.280 --> 02:07:35.280
I don't like that at all

02:07:35.280 --> 02:07:37.280
I almost tased myself

02:07:37.280 --> 02:07:39.280
That's awkward

02:07:39.280 --> 02:07:41.280
Anyways don't worry about that

02:07:41.280 --> 02:07:43.280
We're fine

02:07:43.280 --> 02:07:45.280
My neighbors are running by

02:07:45.280 --> 02:07:47.280
With their little loud children

02:07:47.280 --> 02:07:49.280
E E electric shock

02:07:49.280 --> 02:07:51.280

A lot of students laser

02:07:55.280 --> 02:07:57.280
Oh it's just reverb right now and a little bit of echo

02:07:57.280 --> 02:07:59.280
Echo echo

02:07:59.280 --> 02:08:01.280

02:08:07.280 --> 02:08:09.280
shock collar

02:08:09.280 --> 02:08:11.280
Maybe I'll use my shock collar for 10k

02:08:11.280 --> 02:08:13.280
Subs

02:08:13.280 --> 02:08:15.280

Hold on let me get some more water

02:08:17.280 --> 02:08:19.280

02:08:25.280 --> 02:08:27.280

02:08:29.280 --> 02:08:31.280
I'm taking my salt water

02:08:31.280 --> 02:08:33.280
You don't have to run over here

02:08:33.280 --> 02:08:35.280
It's not fine for treats, ma'am

02:08:35.280 --> 02:08:37.280
We've got 8 or 2 over there

02:08:39.280 --> 02:08:41.280

Woogie woogie woogie

02:08:53.280 --> 02:08:55.280
You can't see it

02:08:55.280 --> 02:08:57.280
It's electric

02:08:57.280 --> 02:08:59.280
Woogie woogie

02:08:59.280 --> 02:09:01.280

Oh

Oregon tipped $13.37.

02:14:24.920 --> 02:14:25.760
Thank you, Morgan.

02:14:25.760 --> 02:14:28.200
This stream is the happiest I've been in months.

02:14:28.200 --> 02:14:29.200
Oh, I'm so glad.

02:14:29.200 --> 02:14:31.560
You're existing and sharing a part of yourself with us.

02:14:31.560 --> 02:14:32.240
Of course.

02:14:32.240 --> 02:14:34.160
I also really want to give you a hug

02:14:34.160 --> 02:14:39.000
to show you how much I appreciate this for being you.

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000
Thank you, Morgan.

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.640
I'm going to cry if you hug me, I'll cry.

02:14:44.640 --> 02:14:46.120
Yay.

02:14:46.120 --> 02:14:47.600

02:14:47.600 --> 02:14:48.440
Thank you.

02:14:48.440 --> 02:14:50.120
You guys give me lots of love.

02:14:50.120 --> 02:14:52.760
I'll do a little bit of rap for you.

02:14:52.760 --> 02:14:57.120
So we'll do, because I like to rap, I'm going to do gorillas.

02:14:57.120 --> 02:14:58.400
Feel good.

02:14:58.400 --> 02:15:01.640
No, Clint Eastwood, sorry.

02:15:01.640 --> 02:15:05.880
Because I actually, actually know the rap for Clint Eastwood.

02:15:05.880 --> 02:15:07.480
Let's see, let's see, let's see.

02:15:08.480 --> 02:15:14.960
I like how this is turned into just like a pseudo karaoke.

02:15:14.960 --> 02:15:16.200
Wait, hold on.

02:15:16.200 --> 02:15:17.720
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

02:15:17.720 --> 02:15:21.880
You know what I should do to make this ambiance a little bit

02:15:21.880 --> 02:15:22.720
better?

02:15:22.720 --> 02:15:24.280
Yeah, now, halt on.

02:15:24.280 --> 02:15:25.640
I got you.

02:15:25.640 --> 02:15:28.440
I got you so, so good.

02:15:28.440 --> 02:15:29.320
Did it do good, wait.

02:15:33.880 --> 02:15:34.880
Let's see.

02:15:38.480 --> 02:15:44.480
I don't have like woosh or whatever or shoest, but this is fine, right?

02:16:05.480 --> 02:16:06.480
What?

02:16:06.480 --> 02:16:08.480
You have a small peepee?

02:16:08.480 --> 02:16:09.480
I can't believe it.

02:16:09.480 --> 02:16:10.480
No, I'm kidding.

02:16:10.480 --> 02:16:11.480
I love that effect.

02:16:11.480 --> 02:16:12.480
It's so funny.

02:16:12.480 --> 02:16:14.480
OK, that's fine.

02:16:14.480 --> 02:16:17.480
Let me do a little bit of lighting.

02:16:23.480 --> 02:16:24.480
Oh, hi, Rena.

02:16:30.480 --> 02:16:33.480
You're going to set the mood, yeah.

02:16:37.480 --> 02:16:40.480
Oh, I'm big.

02:16:40.480 --> 02:16:44.480
I'm trying to scroll through the chat.

02:16:44.480 --> 02:16:48.480
MSI, maybe MIT MSI.

02:16:48.480 --> 02:16:49.480
I killed it.

02:16:49.480 --> 02:16:50.480
Thank you.

02:16:50.480 --> 02:16:51.480
Dare.

02:16:51.480 --> 02:16:52.480
I do love dare.

02:16:52.480 --> 02:16:53.480
It's coming out.

02:16:53.480 --> 02:16:54.480
It's coming out.

02:16:54.480 --> 02:16:55.480
It's that.

02:16:55.480 --> 02:16:56.480
Oh.

02:16:56.480 --> 02:17:00.480
You've got to press it on you.

02:17:00.480 --> 02:17:05.480
You just think that's why you do, baby.

02:17:06.480 --> 02:17:08.480
Hold it down there.

02:17:11.480 --> 02:17:12.480
Ignore that side.

02:17:12.480 --> 02:17:13.480
It's fine.

02:17:14.480 --> 02:17:15.480
Now it's better.

02:17:16.480 --> 02:17:18.480
I wish I could darken my room.

02:17:19.480 --> 02:17:20.480
Can I?

02:17:20.480 --> 02:17:22.480
I don't think I can.

02:17:22.480 --> 02:17:23.480
Filters.

02:17:24.480 --> 02:17:25.480
Change of fact.

02:17:27.480 --> 02:17:28.480
Color correction.

02:17:29.480 --> 02:17:30.480
Color correction.

02:17:30.480 --> 02:17:31.480
Opacity black.

02:17:32.480 --> 02:17:33.480
Close.

02:17:33.480 --> 02:17:35.480
Yeah, baby.

02:17:39.480 --> 02:17:40.480
Oh, yeah.

02:17:40.480 --> 02:17:42.480
That can actually be really funny.

02:17:42.480 --> 02:17:44.480
To recreate the dare music video.

02:17:44.480 --> 02:17:45.480
That's actually good.

02:17:45.480 --> 02:17:47.480
I used to drive from the boys.

02:17:47.480 --> 02:17:51.480
I don't think I could do that glamorous or furky, perhaps.

02:17:53.480 --> 02:17:54.480
Listen to the single.

02:17:54.480 --> 02:17:55.480
Listen to the music.

02:17:55.480 --> 02:17:56.480
Sing with me.

02:17:56.480 --> 02:17:58.480
Oh, I love that.

02:17:58.480 --> 02:17:59.480
All right.

02:17:59.480 --> 02:18:00.480
All right.

02:18:00.480 --> 02:18:01.480
I'm sorry guys.

02:18:01.480 --> 02:18:05.480
I won't be able to do all the suggestions, but I'm trying to get through a lot of them

02:18:05.480 --> 02:18:07.480
because you guys have a lot of good ones.

02:18:13.480 --> 02:18:15.480
It's getting way closer to technique.

02:18:25.480 --> 02:18:26.480
That was weird.

02:18:26.480 --> 02:18:27.480
Sorry.

02:18:27.480 --> 02:18:28.480
The way it started like, hold on.

02:18:28.480 --> 02:18:29.480
I think we'll laugh.

02:18:33.480 --> 02:18:34.480
All right.

02:18:34.480 --> 02:18:35.480
Hold on.

02:18:41.480 --> 02:18:42.480
Feel good.

02:18:44.480 --> 02:18:45.480
Feel good.

02:18:47.480 --> 02:18:48.480
I know this is feel good.

02:18:48.480 --> 02:18:49.480
I want to clean Eastwood.

02:18:49.480 --> 02:18:50.480
What am I doing?

02:18:51.480 --> 02:18:52.480
That's better.

02:18:54.480 --> 02:18:55.480
I was like, wait a second.

02:18:59.480 --> 02:19:03.480
Oh, I ain't happy.

02:19:03.480 --> 02:19:08.480
I'm feeling glad I got sunshine in a bag.

02:19:08.480 --> 02:19:11.480
I'm useless, but not for long.

02:19:11.480 --> 02:19:13.480
The future is coming on.

02:19:13.480 --> 02:19:15.480
I ain't happy.

02:19:15.480 --> 02:19:19.480
I'm feeling glad I got sunshine in a bag.

02:19:19.480 --> 02:19:22.480
I'm useless, but not for long.

02:19:22.480 --> 02:19:25.480
The future is coming on.

02:19:25.480 --> 02:19:26.480
It's coming on.

02:19:26.480 --> 02:19:27.480
It's coming on.

02:19:27.480 --> 02:19:28.480
It's coming on.

02:19:28.480 --> 02:19:29.480
It's coming on.

02:19:29.480 --> 02:19:30.480
It's coming on.

02:19:30.480 --> 02:19:33.480
Finally, someone let me out of my cage.

02:19:33.480 --> 02:19:36.480
Now, time is for me for nothing because I'm counting no age.

02:19:36.480 --> 02:19:37.480
Now, I couldn't be there.

02:19:37.480 --> 02:19:39.480
No, you shouldn't be scared.

02:19:39.480 --> 02:19:43.480
I am good at repairs and I'm under each snare, each tangible.

02:19:43.480 --> 02:19:44.480
But you didn't think so.

02:19:44.480 --> 02:19:46.480
I command you to panoramic you.

02:19:46.480 --> 02:19:48.480
Look, I'll make it all manageable.

02:19:48.480 --> 02:19:51.480
Pick and choose, sit and lose all your different crews.

02:19:51.480 --> 02:19:54.480
Chicks and dudes who you think is really kicking tunes.

02:19:54.480 --> 02:19:57.480
Picture you getting down in a picture tube.

02:19:57.480 --> 02:19:58.480
Like you lift the fuse.

02:19:58.480 --> 02:20:01.480
You think it's fictional, mystical, maybe.

02:20:01.480 --> 02:20:05.480
Spiritual, hero who appears in you to clear your view when you're too crazy.

02:20:05.480 --> 02:20:09.480
Lifeless, but to those who definition for life is priceless to you

02:20:09.480 --> 02:20:12.480
because I put you on the hype shit you like it.

02:20:12.480 --> 02:20:14.480
Done smoking righteous with one token.

02:20:14.480 --> 02:20:17.480
Psychic among those possess you with one dose.

02:20:19.480 --> 02:20:20.480
Breathe.

02:20:22.480 --> 02:20:25.480
Useless, but not for long.

02:20:25.480 --> 02:20:27.480
The future is coming on.

02:20:27.480 --> 02:20:29.480
I ain't happy.

02:20:29.480 --> 02:20:33.480
I'm feeling glad I got harem in a bag.

02:20:33.480 --> 02:20:36.480
I'm useless, but not for long.

02:20:36.480 --> 02:20:39.480
The future is coming on.

02:20:39.480 --> 02:20:40.480
Is coming on.

02:20:40.480 --> 02:20:41.480
Is coming on.

02:20:41.480 --> 02:20:42.480
Is coming on.

02:20:42.480 --> 02:20:43.480
Is coming on.

02:20:43.480 --> 02:20:44.480
Is coming on.

02:20:44.480 --> 02:20:45.480
Is coming on.

02:20:45.480 --> 02:20:46.480
The essence, the basics.

02:20:46.480 --> 02:20:47.480
Without it, you make it.

02:20:47.480 --> 02:20:51.480
Allow me to make this childlike in nature rhythm.

02:20:51.480 --> 02:20:52.480
You have it or you don't.

02:20:52.480 --> 02:20:53.480
That's a fallacy.

02:20:53.480 --> 02:20:54.480
I'm in them.

02:20:54.480 --> 02:20:55.480
Every sprout and tree.

02:20:55.480 --> 02:20:56.480
Every child piece.

02:20:56.480 --> 02:20:57.480
Every cloud and sea.

02:20:57.480 --> 02:20:58.480
You see with your eyes.

02:20:58.480 --> 02:21:00.480
I see destruction and demise.

02:21:00.480 --> 02:21:03.480
Corruption and disguise from this fucking enterprise.

02:21:03.480 --> 02:21:04.480
I'm sucked into your lies.

02:21:04.480 --> 02:21:08.480
We wrestle not as muscles, but percussion he provides for me as a guy.

02:21:08.480 --> 02:21:11.480
Y'all can see me now because you don't see with your eye.

02:21:11.480 --> 02:21:13.480
You perceive with your mind.

02:21:13.480 --> 02:21:14.480
That's the inner.

02:21:14.480 --> 02:21:17.480
So I'm a stick around with Russ and be a mentor.

02:21:17.480 --> 02:21:18.480
That's a few rhymes.

02:21:18.480 --> 02:21:21.480
So motherfuckers remember what the thought is.

02:21:21.480 --> 02:21:25.480
I brought all this so you can survive when law is lawless.

02:21:25.480 --> 02:21:28.480
Feeling sensations that you thought was dead.

02:21:28.480 --> 02:21:29.480
No squealing.

02:21:29.480 --> 02:21:31.480
Remember that's all in your head.

02:21:31.480 --> 02:21:32.480
I ain't happy.

02:21:32.480 --> 02:21:36.480
I'm feeling glad I got sunshine in a bag.

02:21:36.480 --> 02:21:39.480
I'm useless, but not for long.

02:21:39.480 --> 02:21:42.480
My future is coming on.

02:21:42.480 --> 02:21:44.480
I ain't happy.

02:21:44.480 --> 02:21:48.480
Feeling glad I got sunshine in a bag.

02:21:48.480 --> 02:21:51.480
I'm useless, but not for long.

02:21:51.480 --> 02:21:53.480
My future is coming on.

02:21:53.480 --> 02:21:55.480
It's coming on.

02:21:55.480 --> 02:21:57.480
It's coming on.

02:21:57.480 --> 02:21:59.480
It's coming on.

02:21:59.480 --> 02:22:02.480
My future is coming on.

02:22:02.480 --> 02:22:04.480
It's coming on.

02:22:04.480 --> 02:22:06.480
It's coming on.

Oh, that's good.

02:27:24.440 --> 02:27:25.720
I was like moving around so much,

I need to crack my back.

02:27:28.920 --> 02:27:31.520
All right, I need a softer song for my voice.

02:27:32.320 --> 02:27:34.520
Where do you girls have evidence of this new book?

02:27:34.520 --> 02:27:35.920

03:05:33.520 --> 03:05:37.440
guys have been kind of really helping me get that anxiety off because i'll be flying by myself

03:05:37.440 --> 03:05:43.120
and have a phone by myself in a very long time seeing my grandparents i'm gone from the 18th

03:05:43.120 --> 03:05:50.960

03:05:52.800 --> 03:05:57.520
like twitter space while i'm there maybe when my grandparents are out at like church or something

03:05:57.520 --> 03:06:06.960
i can do they're at church and i'm just like hey guys welcome to the twitter space um but yeah

03:06:08.800 --> 03:06:13.840
flying can be scary it's not i'm not worried about like flying it's like it's like moving

03:06:13.840 --> 03:06:21.840
through an airport that i haven't been to in a very very long time um it's like it's all the

03:06:21.840 --> 03:06:27.040
unknown like i know on a plane like i'm just on a plane that's fine i'm fine i'm fine flying but

03:06:27.040 --> 03:06:35.600
like traveling by myself is scary especially as a girl um but yeah you guys over skipping bible

03:06:35.600 --> 03:06:41.680
study for bible study being a makeup guinea pig is basically much okay so nothing will be changed

03:06:41.680 --> 03:06:48.720
for you then yeah you know touching the bible when i'm gone by the way you cannot speak to the lord

03:06:48.720 --> 03:06:54.480

03:06:54.480 --> 03:06:59.920
anyone teach me how to do makeup growing up yeah hope everybody enjoys it i don't think you'll

03:06:59.920 --> 03:07:03.200

03:15:29.840 --> 03:15:33.280
they fill a niche but they're also amazing even when not playing into the roles exactly

03:15:33.840 --> 03:15:38.320
exactly and then sometimes we play into each other's roles it's fun sometimes we just improv

03:15:38.320 --> 03:15:45.840
like me and just say out totally crazy stuff oh my reina i have three cats and they like to

03:15:45.840 --> 03:15:53.680
knock stuff over reina you're pulling out my headphones has already been three hours apparently

03:15:53.680 --> 03:15:59.680
so um i also usually do endurance streams so like you might see the nice dream for like nine hours

03:15:59.680 --> 03:16:06.480
of an elden ring because i love elden ring um and i also played elden ring for four hours and

03:16:06.480 --> 03:16:12.240
formed and just improv the entire time he's telling you to stop before midnight it's 11 11

03:16:12.240 --> 03:16:18.880
everybody make a wish my wish is that i hit 10k soon oh reina's purring and she's crawling into

03:16:18.880 --> 03:16:27.440
my arms two hours of elden ring and seven hours of yapping oh yeah i also live hades i wanna play

03:16:27.440 --> 03:16:36.960
hades when they come back it's 5 a.m here oh my god go to bed i wish for cats to be immortal me too

03:16:37.840 --> 03:16:39.200
you also have elden ring no way

03:16:42.960 --> 03:16:47.920
and sometimes i burp so i hope you don't mind i am now lady

03:16:51.040 --> 03:16:55.040
the compilation of all your girls debuses hilarious i saw you shared it on twitter yeah

03:16:55.040 --> 03:17:01.040
it's really awesome it's really funny we have we had so much fun with our debus we're all so nervous

03:17:01.680 --> 03:17:06.240
we're like oh what if people don't like us but it's like i'm so thankful for the um

03:17:07.360 --> 03:17:12.560
the type of reception that we've gotten it's really nice it's hotter with the purr sorry i

03:17:12.560 --> 03:17:19.520
said my desk reina what's up mama come on she's like purring so hard on my shoulder

03:17:19.680 --> 03:17:26.960
all right have a good night we get to hear burps and she's feeling i know sometimes

03:17:26.960 --> 03:17:31.760
i used to give them out willy nilly but now i'm like you know what i'm too nice let me withhold

03:17:31.760 --> 03:17:38.480
my burps because you know i'm running an establishment as madame of wonderland a

03:17:38.480 --> 03:17:43.280
hotel that also doubles as a brothel don't tell anybody and i'm the madame of that establishment

03:17:44.240 --> 03:17:50.880
uh it's only fair that a woman of my caliber upholds her professionalism while streaming to the masses

03:17:50.880 --> 03:17:58.400
you know my favorite moment of view was when you had three heads on top of one in your chest

03:17:58.960 --> 03:18:00.480
yeah be not afraid

03:18:04.560 --> 03:18:10.320
so now we're kidding her reina makes you think of a gender swapped reign from the owl house

03:18:10.320 --> 03:18:11.920
i never watched owl house as a kid

03:18:19.280 --> 03:18:24.640
boomy king of umashu and he was another one of my cats he was in my desk with his paws crossed

03:18:24.640 --> 03:18:30.000
like a gentleman i don't know where fia the deathbed companion who's my other cat her name is actually

03:18:30.000 --> 03:18:33.920
fia the deathbed companion by the way because i love elden ring that much i think she's sleeping

03:18:33.920 --> 03:18:40.640
under my bed boomy why are you just like laying his head in my hand

03:18:49.760 --> 03:18:53.360
you're mad though because i touched his shoulder he only likes his head pat and now he's grooming

03:18:53.360 --> 03:18:57.600
himself named us another cat d that would be so funny

03:18:58.320 --> 03:19:05.280
what's a game that all the six dealer girls want to collab together one day well we wanted to do

03:19:05.280 --> 03:19:12.000
power wash simulator but it didn't work out it like the for someone reason it just wasn't working

03:19:12.000 --> 03:19:15.920
it like it would crash when there was four of us in there and you can have up to six people it was

03:19:15.920 --> 03:19:23.280
really weird so i would like to play power wash simulator and i oh my god in the worst way i want

03:19:23.280 --> 03:19:30.960
to play prop hunt and gary's mod i i have like over just like i have over 600 hours in counter

03:19:30.960 --> 03:19:37.600
strike and i have over 600 hours in gary's mod because all i would do was play trouble in terraced

03:19:37.600 --> 03:19:45.600
town in prop hunt and it was so great also uno yes i want to play uno i love if we had to play

03:19:45.680 --> 03:19:51.760
like prop hunt with the you may plus girls or like with my thos it would be so funny so funny

03:19:54.400 --> 03:19:59.680
so i'm trying to convince the girls to buy um very small it's only like five bucks or

03:19:59.680 --> 03:20:03.360
i think might have been on five bucks for the steam sale but i think that's over so might be nine again

03:20:04.000 --> 03:20:04.480
for ten

03:20:07.840 --> 03:20:15.200
and i'm a i'm a prop hunt veteran so gonna go yes go to sleep go to sleep thank you so much

03:20:15.200 --> 03:20:19.600
for your support and thank you for the song suggestions thank you gt you three different

03:20:19.600 --> 03:20:24.320
youtuber agencies would be cool crazy it really would though it really would

03:20:26.800 --> 03:20:29.840
you don't need counter strike source for some apps yeah that's true i forgot sometimes you

03:20:29.840 --> 03:20:34.720
did desource for some of the maps nowadays i think you can just like download most of them out

03:20:34.720 --> 03:20:42.160
mod packs oh my god i probably just do like the minecraft map one of my faves or office

03:20:42.160 --> 03:20:47.920
i clocked seven forty five hours just messing with friends playing so they capture the classic

03:20:47.920 --> 03:20:54.480
games you see plus mine so that strani would probably like thrive in that game she would i

03:20:54.480 --> 03:20:59.920
think she would like it a lot i just i would love hearing her scream when she get discovered she'd

03:20:59.920 --> 03:21:06.000
be like all right three flings i don't think they all fucking shit now they spotted me and then

03:21:06.000 --> 03:21:12.000
she just fucking runs off i think it'd be so so funny

03:21:15.040 --> 03:21:18.320
counter strike source is defensive or some random stuff but it happened or not that's

03:21:18.320 --> 03:21:24.960
true honestly i'll buy it for everyone i literally i just don't give a shit be like here we go the

03:21:24.960 --> 03:21:33.760
masses want gary's mod the masses will get gary's mod i can already hear mercy screaming whether

03:21:33.760 --> 03:21:42.080
she's the hunter being hunted guys and then when she's chasing one of us to be like i can't do her

03:21:42.080 --> 03:21:46.720
wait let me think of her laugh can't do her laugh that well

03:21:51.280 --> 03:21:54.160
and then she'd laugh and like shoot us explode us

03:21:54.640 --> 03:22:04.560
okay hey do do your part tell the other girls hey you guys should play this game because get

03:22:04.560 --> 03:22:09.760
those suggestions out there if you watch the other girls and i hope you do give them their suggestions

03:22:10.480 --> 03:22:16.080
tell them what's up i guess strani do impressions she does too many of them well

03:22:16.800 --> 03:22:25.520
strani does really funny american accents i think i remember she was like trying to be southern

03:22:25.520 --> 03:22:32.000
ones and i'm like what is this strani's rage heals my soul as well some scottish rage is a

03:22:32.000 --> 03:22:37.440
different type of rage yes cool

03:22:44.000 --> 03:22:48.560
you know we all get really goofy i think we really just like become our truest selves

03:22:48.560 --> 03:22:52.720
in a collab especially the among us collab i can't get over how fun that was the among us

03:22:52.720 --> 03:22:58.240
collab i want to do that again so bad i'm thinking of having some of my um friends on for the next

03:22:58.240 --> 03:23:04.480
one like uh nori and chai chan it can be really fun

03:23:07.760 --> 03:23:10.880
and then yeah emi and ic didn't get to do it last night last time

03:23:12.080 --> 03:23:14.240
so i have a whole cute and funny and then there's me

03:23:16.080 --> 03:23:17.680
i bet i could get like hexa and stuff

03:23:20.000 --> 03:23:23.120
can't be funny some of the other hickenwashi girls

03:23:23.200 --> 03:23:31.360
watch the clip of the among us collab in a sense of freaking funny yeah it was so funny

03:23:31.360 --> 03:23:36.000
and it was well edited there was one i think that uh discount ostrich made he did like a really

03:23:36.000 --> 03:23:41.360
meanie one that was really good shout out to discount ostrich he makes really good compilations

03:23:41.360 --> 03:23:51.200
of us um and he did one of the among us collab and it was literally just so funny and then like

03:23:51.760 --> 03:23:57.120
distrawni just like tricking all of us and like i knew i was on distrawni so many times when i

03:23:57.120 --> 03:24:00.880
doubted myself because i'm like no she would never do that and then i was like why didn't i

03:24:00.880 --> 03:24:07.280
listen to my gut i knew these people were the freaking uh imposters i would also like to do

03:24:07.280 --> 03:24:11.360
like town of salem um i love you still love playing town of salem

03:24:14.160 --> 03:24:17.120
and i feel like that would be kind of better because then we wouldn't have to move around

03:24:17.120 --> 03:24:20.480
as much we could just like talk and just debate the entire time i think that'd be funny

03:24:21.920 --> 03:24:28.000
i'm drunk hello mom are you behaving young man you can only drink at the house you know make sure

03:24:28.000 --> 03:24:36.560
you're safe town of salem super dead oh no i know i haven't played that in a long time i've seen

03:24:36.560 --> 03:24:42.560
like there's like among us adaptations of it so i think maybe that the company was absorbed or whatever

03:24:44.640 --> 03:24:49.280
and then they started with just angrily shouting i remember someone accused her but switched it up

03:24:49.280 --> 03:24:54.640
when you all caught on literally she was like i'll be quiet almost like something's up

03:25:04.960 --> 03:25:09.840
