1
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You

2
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You

3
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You

4
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,680
Hello

5
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:23,420
How's it going? It's an early morning for madam and when I say early it's just 10 a.m

6
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,920
which is the time that

7
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,400
normal people have already gotten up, but you know

8
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,480
Oh

9
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,400
Yeah, you can't see it in my brand new reaction to this game. Yep. Mm-hmm

10
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,780
It's I can't wait. It's gonna be so fun. I've never played this game before

11
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,080
Can't wait can't wait

12
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,200
Turn that BGM down just a smidge in it

13
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,260
How are you guys doing? I

14
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,960
Have Fia on my lap and she's rolling around. What do you do in lady? Oh, she's leaving now, huh?

15
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:12,160
But it was fun snuggling with you. I was hoping to get some purrs on the microphone. I

16
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:19,380
Have early let me just wake up

17
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,580
Grab Russian put a little little makeup I

18
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:31,820
Know some of my Euro viewers are probably pretty happy. I'm I'm this early

19
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,540
Good morning, European viewers

20
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:42,140
Yes, this is a European. I'm speaking European. This is my European language

21
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:50,340
You missed the last hour of stream yesterday we didn't stream yesterday, so I don't know what you're talking about

22
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:57,620
We're playing the first the first game

23
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,140
Boomi is running laps

24
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,460
You probably can hear him

25
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:15,140
My voice is a little eh today, so I'm going to probably just let the voice actors do their thing for this

26
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,060
game

27
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,740
Uh

28
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,860
There's a second game. Yeah, the re-up is the second game

29
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:29,340
Um, yeah, we did in a stream yesterday. I'm so sorry. I canceled stream yesterday guys

30
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:34,620
I just I'm making it up for you by doing two streams today

31
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:39,740
You get two count them two streams today. Can you believe it?

32
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,700
You get um

33
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,700
You get the Stanley parable and you get class of 09

34
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,660
How's their 56 year old streamer?

35
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,100
Uh, you know, I was awake at 6 a.m.

36
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,540
And then I was like just like how old people do

37
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,100
Um, and then I got some stuff done

38
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,460
And I went like right before I started stream

39
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:07,500
I went downstairs to take out the trash and the freaking maintenance guys are in my hallway again

40
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:12,220
And um, and they were just staring at me and I'm like, uh, and I like I probably

41
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,180
I usually don't

42
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,380
like

43
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,820
wear like wearing hyper revealing clothing

44
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:25,980
But I was super lazy and I was just wearing some like pajama booty shorts and a sweatshirt and no bras

45
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,220
And then I'm just like carrying a shit ton of trash

46
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:33,660
In my recycling and then they just stare at me and I'm like, I hate it here

47
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,460
And then I just walk past them into the elevator

48
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,540
For those who don't know, um

49
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,620
For those who don't know, uh the other day

50
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,500
The maintenance guys came into my apartment because they thought I wasn't home. I didn't respond

51
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:54,460
I had headphones on and I had some fun toys and stuff everywhere

52
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:59,500
And a hanger on my door that says do not disturb my master

53
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:08,060
So, uh, I and then they left and I then I realized oh I had stuff out

54
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,620
Awkward

55
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,900
Yeah, they were just changing filters and checking my hot water

56
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:21,020
I'm almost at 4k subs. I know it's crazy. I'm so thankful for that. Why am I bigger?

57
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,500
Um

58
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,020
I'm just getting bigger

59
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:30,460
Uh as for the 16k on twitter, it's kind of on my alt account

60
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:36,700
It's kind of daunting actually and I almost don't like it because one I don't like

61
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,660
I liked having just like a small group of you

62
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,140
Hear my rambles and also my naughty naughty stuff

63
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:51,420
And then two they're probably mostly bots and not genuine like the sex bots from me saying, um

64
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,460
uh porn

65
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,900
Because like the algorithm's been really liking that word so

66
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,140
But I

67
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:03,500
I hope you guys enjoyed the feat. I think my favorite reaction

68
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,380
To the feat

69
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,380
pick for 16k

70
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,180
was um

71
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,340
Your alt was promoted on my timeline before

72
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:17,340
I had at you know, it's just this how it be

73
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,660
my favorite

74
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,340
thing was this like

75
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,340
I thought she was brown

76
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,500
She's not dark enough

77
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,900
Kind of like I said I was mixed

78
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,500
I'm very light-skinned. I haven't been outside since the winter

79
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,940
But when I tan I tan like a mother

80
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:45,980
And I'm like I've only been fighting with this identity crisis my entire life. Now people on the internet are saying I'm not brown enough

81
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:53,980
And then some people in my maros are like, oh my caramel queen

82
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,660
It's always funny

83
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,140
to me when people

84
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,500
uh

85
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:07,260
fetishize my skin tone by comparing me to food

86
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,700
That's like always been a thing

87
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,700
like

88
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,700
growing up for me

89
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,700
like, uh caramel, uh milk chocolate, uh

90
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,500
peanut butter like

91
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,820
on my eye

92
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,540
I think maybe y'all have a more fetish, but

93
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:33,900
I'm like, mm milky way. Mm mocha. Uh my snickers queen. I'm just I'm just

94
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,300
food

95
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,820
4 chain traffic slowed down for half an hour half you post anything

96
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:47,820
Really? That is hilarious. Um, don't steal it. Yeah, I love don't steal it. She though. Um

97
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,700
Uh

98
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:55,580
You do be looking delicious. Yeah, I got I got my toes done. Um, I won't lie to you

99
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:58,140
That's like a picture from like a month ago

100
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:07,660
Because I was preemptively taking photos just as like for like, um

101
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,060
Possible patreon stuff and fansy stuff

102
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,780
If I decide

103
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,780
You brown surprisingly

104
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,340
Honestly, I remember my mom

105
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,580
Uh

106
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,020
She said

107
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:30,220
When I was bored like my parents were expecting me to be dark

108
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,420
But I've also like lightened over

109
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:38,300
As I've grown up like I was very very dark skin when I was young and then randomly

110
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:43,580
I guess my years of being a neat and not seeing the sun just took away my melanin

111
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,900
Chat would you do it for a sheebie snack?

112
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,860
Oh

113
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:55,820
But yeah, if you have to go to work or you have stuff to do you can have me in the background

114
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:01,020
You can just you know, we're just hanging out. We're just we're just chilling this morning. Um

115
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:07,980
I'll probably have a little bit more energy for the the stanley parable stream. I just wanted to make up for you

116
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,980
Know the lack of stream

117
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:15,580
Yesterday it was so crazy all this stuff happened and I couldn't stream

118
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,140
um, but uh

119
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:26,460
Jokes on you. This is my off-riding. Oh good for you. Thank you. Thank you. I think you're great

120
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,180
Thank you. I guess

121
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:35,100
Weird weird wording, but okay, but um guys. I don't want to make

122
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,620
my uh, my flesh roommate

123
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:42,460
A major point of discussion to be honest with you

124
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,140
um

125
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,860
So just enjoy me sheebie

126
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,660
Forget rtx sheebie

127
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,540
okay

128
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,140
so

129
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:57,100
Anyways, uh, I should probably eat something

130
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:02,620
I'm actually okay today despite dying after eating spicy food yesterday

131
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,660
I'm actually okay. I might um

132
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:13,820
Throw a sandwich that I got that you guys didn't know about that I got yesterday in my hair fryer so that um

133
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,340
Um

134
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:19,340
So that uh, I can finish the half of that sandwich

135
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:26,940
I like shapes with all flavors color sizes flesh roommate. Are you talking about? Yeah the cats

136
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,020
I had I

137
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,340
I had to um

138
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,180
I like I'm really mad at my cats because

139
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:42,780
They have three litter boxes because you should have a litter box for each cat. Okay

140
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,940
And they only like to use one of those litter boxes and I don't get it. I'm like

141
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:54,220
So I'm just like it takes me like 15 minutes to scoop one litter box and then the rest are like super fast

142
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:01,260
Uh going to try it end it all on that by at least by yeah, maybe at this point

143
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:06,940
I'm sorry. Sometimes I'll get notifications on my phone

144
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:14,940
For like people who like my tweets and stuff and some of you have the most out-of-pocket usernames that I just

145
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,180
I just can't fathom I

146
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:26,140
Did we're not gonna talk about my cats shits. Why is chat so poor today?

147
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:33,740
Hello vtuber v connoisseur. Where's my rating bro? Where's my rating? Did you post it?

148
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,700
Um

149
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:41,100
Your cat's like but but he's for you for me. Uh

150
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:49,500
I meant I like you for you. You're good boomi. What are you doing big man?

151
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:58,300
But uh, yeah, eventually for like monetization stream. I'm thinking that because somebody set me a snack box of

152
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:02,860
Japanese snacks, so I'm gonna do a thigh and hand well mostly a

153
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,940
Well, I'll kind of be like a neck down cam

154
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,820
in cosplay of sheebie

155
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,300
um

156
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:16,220
And then I'll have like my cat's bed will probably be off to the side so you might see them

157
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:20,620
Um, I really I've had some Japanese snacks before

158
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:24,700
So I'm excited to like eat them again because I can't get them often

159
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:32,540
Well the box it's it's actually sealed. I've actually demonstrated a lot of self control to not eat the Sakura box

160
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,700
like

161
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,820
Oh

162
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,460
I'm tempted to add like another sort of

163
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,700
um

164
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,620
Snack box to my stream I to be I just need to go grocery shopping like

165
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:51,100
I only grabbed a couple of things when I went out to get some booze and stuff for um the drunk stream

166
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,380
Excuse me

167
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,980
but um

168
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,980
What the heck is all over my desk?

169
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,820
um

170
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:08,060
So like I'm like I also I was checking my mail today and I was I got a hello fresh offer and I'm like

171
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,780
You know, I'm so busy

172
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:16,220
I might just do like the hello fresh stuff and then we can have like cooking streams

173
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,660
So I'm excited

174
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,100
I'm sorry

175
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,820
Mom just took somebody out. I was just begging to be stuck

176
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,140
Don't spam chat with your cringe behavior

177
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,140
I don't it is not does not get rewarded

178
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,500
Throne snack box subscription one

179
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,780
Yeah, I'm like

180
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:49,660
I added some cat trees to my uh throne for the kitty cats because they I only have um

181
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:54,140
Like these two and they just fight there's like one they really love and they fight over

182
00:15:54,540 --> 00:16:01,020
I also want to get one that's a little bit lower for rena because rena's 14 years old and I don't want her hurting herself jumping up

183
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:01,900
although

184
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,900
When I came back from

185
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,900
Dropping off like throwing away my trash

186
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:11,100
Um, I come back in and all my cats are just sitting on the counter staring at me

187
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,900
and I'm just like

188
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:18,700
Sorry, did I interrupt some sort of cat meeting like what just happened?

189
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,380
Um

190
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,460
But yeah, I

191
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:30,380
It's like go back to me randomly blowing up on

192
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,100
um

193
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,260
Twitter I

194
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:41,660
I'm still going to treat it as an alt like it's not gonna be my main

195
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:46,140
so you're still gonna get like the spicy whatever's and the um

196
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:51,580
My rambling and silly stuff and then my main will continue to be

197
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,540
just a little bit

198
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:59,020
More professional, but I still be my goofy self

199
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:07,660
But yeah, I generally just don't like it. So I'm like trying to funnel the attention to the other girls

200
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:12,940
I'm feeling very strawny like or I'm like, uh, she's like

201
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:17,980
Support my daughters. I'm like support my gen mates. Please. I don't want the attention

202
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,780
I don't

203
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:25,820
I'm like, okay, cool. I'll probably get like a thousand followers after playing with the algorithm. No

204
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,020
um

205
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:33,180
Yeah, mercy me and mercy. We're both freaking out on discord. We're just like, oh

206
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,100
I am not the face of healer that is

207
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:46,060
Incorrect. I do not want to be the face of healer. That is no, that's all of us. I was gonna say it was strawny. It's all of us

208
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,620
um

209
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:51,660
Rambling's the best part. Well, no, it's because I

210
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,140
I

211
00:17:54,140 --> 00:18:00,380
Smartly retweeted all the spicy stuff. So when people saw that my viral tweet that I think has like

212
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:06,700
8k or 16k likes first of all, what the hell? Um

213
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:12,620
They I was like so they went on my they would go to my page and so they would see all that stuff

214
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,500
And they're like, oh, she actually does what she says. Let me follow

215
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,500
And then I also retreated a bunch of the girl stuff

216
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:24,140
So they would also get the attention like the algorithm is so weird like what I remember when

217
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,180
We first debuted randomly as Zara's

218
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:33,340
Um post blew up of her like showing off her voluptuous and delicious body

219
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:38,940
Um, so like the the algorithm it works in mysterious ways

220
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,260
It's not nice. It's just like I

221
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,780
I want them to succeed

222
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:51,740
So I am also going to just like strawny do everything in my power to

223
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,300
help them succeed and

224
00:18:54,780 --> 00:19:00,940
I don't even measure success by the numbers. It's really just how people react to me

225
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,740
But I know other people do

226
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,100
sometimes

227
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,100
I got 14 likes gross

228
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,460
So

229
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:16,780
Like if if it was anybody like if it was one of the other girls this happened to like imi or mercy or azura

230
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,780
Or icy

231
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:23,180
Or strawny we would all have done the same thing and try to lift each other up

232
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:29,580
And I know like we we will continue to do so because I we all want each other to be great because we know

233
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:33,900
We have the potential to be amazing in the vtuber sphere, but um

234
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:39,340
Yeah, I just think it probably left its intended audience because I don't

235
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:43,180
I don't wreck it like I don't see any vtuber fans

236
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:48,940
Following me and I'm like god damn it like and my whole timeline is just normy shit

237
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,380
You saw ic's cute outfit pic. Oh hell. Yeah, I did. She's so adorable

238
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:57,660
You don't even know how cute ic is. She's literally so cute

239
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:02,620
Like she's so shown me more outfits and the other girl's more outfits that she likes to wear and I'm like

240
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:07,980
Oh my god, I just wanted to stick you in my pocket and carry you around like the little small b and you are

241
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:14,140
She's supposed to be the mesugaki or kusa gaki, but she's just my little princess gaki

242
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,300
That's all I gotta say

243
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:23,340
What to each breach confinement it did oh you're a vtuber, but like yeah, I don't know

244
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:27,980
What does a vtuber fan look like? I think maybe I'm just used to following other vtubers. Um

245
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:35,980
I I remember when I first in another in another realm in another life when I worked at a temple as a priestess. Um

246
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:40,220
I uh, I think my my

247
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,580
My

248
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:50,140
viewer base was actually mostly other vtubers. I think so I'm just not used to having like actual

249
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,500
People who like vtubers watch me

250
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,300
So

251
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,580
We're 100 kilograms to use those trail of slime at what?

252
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:06,620
So you're actually making your nsf, but it's not like it's not like my

253
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:11,180
My sheevy cotton bomb account is my main like that is

254
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,660
The nsfw is my all and yeah, it's bigger, but it's

255
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,460
you know

256
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:22,620
I just I don't want all that shit clogging up the average person's feed

257
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,180
um

258
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,540
but uh

259
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:29,900
Vtuber fans of anime profile pictures cordon

260
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,700
Yeah, that's pretty accurate. Um

261
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:40,860
But yeah, please if you have discovered me through my alt account on twitter, please consider

262
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,340
I'm looking in my description

263
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:48,220
In checking out the girls. Um, because they are cooler than I am

264
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,580
And they're better at sticking to kayfabe

265
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:57,180
Uh, I'm just uh, your dorky girl fell dumb

266
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,380
Uh

267
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:05,580
Put put some your goofy ah humor on me. Well, I do put some my goofy ah humor

268
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:13,260
Where are the gorillas? They're right here, baby girl. Um, all the veeler girls are amazing. Yeah

269
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:16,460
that seems to uh be the consensus which I'm

270
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,420
happy for like

271
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:26,540
I know sometimes like I know strawnee's intention was to get someone of every flavor like you would like one person at least out of all of us

272
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,220
but

273
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:35,340
I definitely like when we all finally got into chat together and we all got on discord. We all did like our mock debuts. I'm like, oh

274
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,580
they

275
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:43,980
They the hoes going love this they're fucking gonna love us because we're all amazing

276
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,620
I know

277
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:51,100
She failed. I like all six. I know it's great. I think we're all just like

278
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:57,900
Very different and but very alike and I can't wait. Um for when we do more collabs and stuff

279
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,460
I know we have a collab coming up very soon

280
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,020
So i'm very excited

281
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,940
And then I think hold on. Let me look at my schedule. I can't remember

282
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,580
Well, this is too small for me to read. Um

283
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,580
I got strawnee says he's eating sweets from around the world and she got talkies

284
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,700
Okay, oh yes

285
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,420
Oh, yeah, it's all coming together

286
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,820
I

287
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:40,700
Also need to like set up some collabs of people because I want to collab with dempa. I want to collab with nori

288
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,340
I want to collab with chai

289
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:50,060
Um, there's a lot of uh vnu girls. I want to collab with I want to collab with the the you may plus girls

290
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,300
Which would be really fun

291
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,260
Uh

292
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:58,860
Yeah, I just like I just want to make friends

293
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,500
I only

294
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,500
I only have two

295
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,540
Rtx friends

296
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,540
And I haven't seen them in like a month

297
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,020
I need to go outside

298
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:16,060
Oh chai is really oh, I love chai. She is my my my one and only

299
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:20,700
Her and nori are my baby girls. We need I need to play overcooked with them again

300
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,420
Oh my god, boomie. What are you doing?

301
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:30,620
Try to watch all the debuts from the gen big mistake. Literally was a zombie for the day. Curse my time. So oh watch the vods

302
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,620
Watch the vods my dear

303
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,700
only

304
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:39,580
Making friends in an adult impossible. I know like um, it's like

305
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,140
All right

306
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,940
It like I they were my friends from work too

307
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:48,620
Like I don't know how to make friends outside of that like do I

308
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:52,620
Go to a mall and be like who wants to be my friend?

309
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:58,540
So I'm kind of like because I don't have any fucking hobbies that'll introduce me to new people like oh

310
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:04,940
Uh, yes, I am an equestrian with my riding crop. Ho, ho, ho. Oh wait, that's not the

311
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:08,700
Right toggle with my riding crop

312
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:17,260
And uh, I I meet a lot of other equestrians while riding. Yes, uh, but

313
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,580
Hey

314
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,900
But um

315
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,020
Bro, what are you doing?

316
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:35,180
Boomie, are you okay? You scared the shit out of me

317
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,500
No, so I I'm fine

318
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:47,420
My um, so I was feeding my cats wet food this morning. So I put them all on their stainless steel bowls

319
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:55,100
And boomie decided to zoomie and run over one and it flew across the room. So give me one second to go get that

320
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,140
Yeah, it's okay

321
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,460
It's just your brother being stupid

322
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,900
Dude, where the fuck did the bowl go?

323
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:08,940
Boomie, how did you throw it? He threw it across

324
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,060
But we're like legit across the room

325
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:24,060
Where are you running with this in your mouth? Boomie's a big cat. So I want to put a pass up for running with this Google

326
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:29,580
Why did my tv turn on awkward but I don't know how that happened

327
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,060
Um

328
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,540
Classic cat behavior. Yeah

329
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:42,700
There are still nerdy hobbies to do as adult to find new friends. Yeah, like me too being

330
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,340
This is my hobby

331
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:49,100
I remember when I was putting together my db sides, they were like

332
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,900
Oh, um

333
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:58,700
so what do you do for hobbies and like the person who uh, the the graphic artists that was helping me, um

334
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,420
Put the stuff together and I'm like

335
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,220
V to be

336
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:10,860
I don't know. I fucking read like I'm boring as fuck. How did I get here? Why do they hire me?

337
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:16,220
Love the cat action on your streams girlfriend goes to see what the cats are doing ASMR

338
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:22,220
What the fuck? I just heard a noise. Is someone breaking in? Oh, no, it's my cats

339
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:31,100
Oh, sorry, I'm drinking tea. It's called throat coat

340
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,460
wink um

341
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:37,100
But like it's good for throat issues

342
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:41,660
Because I'm a major fucking yapper. It's been 30 minutes as per usual

343
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,100
and I still haven't started the game and um

344
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:49,660
But it has licorice root in it and I hate the taste of licorice. Hi, Selma

345
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:56,540
Oh, yeah, throat coats the bomb. I also have some Ricola next to me

346
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:06,460
Okay, I also I I'm pretty sure I fixed text to speech in my alerts

347
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,260
um for

348
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,140

00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:53,180
She's starting the game. I eated my um

355
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:58,940
What's it called my overlay because it just bothers the crap out of me sometimes

356
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,060
What's the bubble that I can't fit text into?

357
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,460
Wait, are you tallian?

358

00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:32,540
But it doesn't do the texas speech want the hell

362
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:41,020

00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:49,660
It's not a sheebie stream without scuff. Don't forget

365
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:57,020
Finally I can text to speech the vtuber about being a boy failure midstream

366
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,980

367
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:14,380
Okay, that's good texas speech settings on is it and

368
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:21,580
Hold on I need checks discord because managers send us a message about all of us to set it up

369
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,860
And I didn't listen

00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:34,940
Where's the fuck is it I'll take you along for me to scroll through

371
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:38,220

This isn't just beautiful music

375
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,740
It's actually like really good piano

376
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,820
It should only be a delay of one second

377
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:33,980
Okay, sorry I can't see chat

00:31:55,660 --> 00:32:00,140
I wish I could play piano. I've been told I have very long fingers to play piano

381
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,460

But thank you for 4k

395
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:28,700
Waiting for youtube to catch up. Um with the monetization stuff

396
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:35,260
Because we all hit our like the watch hours on debut

397
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:42,700
But we have to wait like a week to set up the monetization almost like how twitch does um with um

398
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:47,500
What you ever called all my stuff's gonna get demonetized anyways, but you know, it's whatever

399
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:54,060
Maybe I just want to hug too bad cry harder

400
00:33:55,900 --> 00:34:01,820
You smell like tea. It's good tea. It's lemon ginger tea with a little bit of like a rich root throat coat

401
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:10,060
Please don't zoom like that. I'm watching my phone at work. What do you mean like what?

402
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:16,620
What are you talking about like what wait, do you have your volume turned on?

403
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:21,180
Oh, oh, oh my god

404
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:43,900
I'm sorry. I might have been mildly inspired by a certain someone who's like

405
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:51,340
Who is reacting to someone saying? Oh, I have my um volume up and I'm on a bus because I can't hear that well

406
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:56,140
And so she started just screaming the most terrible things

407
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:05,100
Oh streams not gonna survive. Uh, no the stream is gonna survive. Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it

408
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:11,180
I know who you're talking about. Okay. Yeah

409
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,300
I think you're cool or something

410
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:19,980
Uh, let's you we're doing a new game because we never played before

411
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:23,100
No mistake

412
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,420
I'm a sociopath

413
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:31,900
God that sounded evil. Let's rewind a little I grew up all over coastal america

414
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,860
House after house after restraining order

415
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:41,100
Everything just kind of blends in if the divorce rate is 50 50 my mom landed on tails like eight times

416
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:44,380
So by the time I was 14, you've never seen this before so we have to watch it

417
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:48,540
You know and attended six different school districts after a while

418
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:53,660
You don't see a point in making friends the vitamin c graduation song. Yeah, I can't relate

419
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:57,980
But then one year all of that almost changed. I'm gonna eat a lozen

420
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:05,340
I found myself in a school for two consecutive years going on three and then I like started turning three into high school

421
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:08,060
so the guys hitting on you social leverage was

422
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,220
I've never played ace attorney

423
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,340
I've only ever watched game grumps play it

424
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,380
Like they had always been pretty

425
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,140
never left out

426
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:20,860
This feels like a viewer debut and when I think about it

427
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:24,060
All the thinking I never done was when I was alone

428
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:27,420
I was nice about it and thought I'd always be nice about it

429
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:30,540
Finally in one place to build a steady reputation

430
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:36,940
And then life said fuck that my piece of shit gamer brother got us evicted for pirating break beat

431
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:43,740
Again, I love the piano. I mean not again. This is the first time. Um, the moving boxes and how she reads

432
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:48,700
We're moving out of state and I just got settled. They said, fuck you. I'm living with

433
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:52,220
Oh, yeah, game grumps is my and markiplier my my comfort

434
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,260
YouTubers

435
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:58,540
My second christmas killed himself. I walked in. I usually

436
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:02,140
look like a whole ass video game just blood everywhere and get this

437
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:07,900
His suicide note. I usually have them in the background when I'm doing stuff because I can't focus unless I hear noise

438
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:14,780
I'm Nicole by the way. Hi. What the fuck did I do to him? Maybe I missed the office softball game

439
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:20,700
Men are so into this revenge suicide house party playthrough. Oh my god. I would love to play house party

440
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,020
I'm moving

441
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:24,380
again

442
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:26,220
city county state

443
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,220
all the same fate

444
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:31,420
Watch gerba. I need to watch gerba because I feel like he's right up my alley

445
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:41,980
And then I like I just watched Jenna marbles. She's also my comfort youtuber even though she's not a pro anymore

446
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:53,740
I think I'm trying to remember I think for my senior prank. Oh my god, I can't fucking pause

447
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,740
Yeah, like fuck mr. Brubin a dude

448
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,700
Please

449
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,660
I don't know why they don't let you pause this part

450
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:05,660
German marbles. Oh my god a collab between them

451
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:11,260
Wow, yeah, that was funny. Yeah, I'm getting into like humor and stuff. Anyway

452
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:14,060
Okay, now I can pause uh

453
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:15,740
so

454
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,740
my school

455
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,740
um

456
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,740
was really weird

457
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,980
and

458
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,540
not

459
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,540
like

460
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,220
creative

461
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:35,020
like the the apparently the seniors before us like let a pig into the

462
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,740
uh school

463
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:41,100
The game is full auto. Yeah. I I there's nothing I can do about it

464
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:44,380
I can

465
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:46,540
Fuck um

466
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:51,500
But then what we did for our senior prank was just

467
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,700
Take every chair in the building

468
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:57,820
And put it in the gymnasium

469
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:05,660
So like I don't even know how they did that

470
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:11,820
I think the janitor like let them into the school and like unlock shit for them

471
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,540
and they just

472
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,660
but

473
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:16,940
And then

474
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,940
Yeah

475
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:21,740
And then there's a senior skip day where everybody skipped school

476
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:24,780
um

477
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:27,340
And I went to school

478
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:30,220
On senior skip day

479
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,620
Listen, I wasn't cool enough

480
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:38,220
Well, I was I like like I was growing up

481
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:42,380
I was the girl so like I've said before like I was a really religious christian girl

482
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:46,460
So I was uh a target for like um

483
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,820
Upper classmen and stuff

484
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,220
Uh

485
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:57,100
So I remember like other like the popular senior boys would try to corrupt me

486
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:02,460
And so they're like, oh you want to come to the beach with us and I was like, uh, no

487
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,100
Because I won I was oblivious

488
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,500
to

489
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,540
I just wanted I had stuff to do that day, you know, I had to hop on wolf quest

490
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,020
How to read my warrior cats

491
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:19,500
How are you feeling about the lord these days? I'm a pagan bro

492

Me and emmy we on that witch shit me emmy and mercy we on that witch shit

494
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:32,460
Don't wear your cat's face

495
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:35,020
What's wolf quest?

496
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:41,100
Actually, I was thinking more games to play next week. Maybe I might change it to wolf quest

497
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:45,980
Actually, no, I have to do that the week after because they already made our thumbnails and I feel bad

498
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,100
I'm catholic. I'm so sorry

499
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:51,260
um

500
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,900
Honestly, uh

501
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,980

If you have any sort of religious affiliation you do you

504
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:07,020

505
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,980

531
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:08,620
Why the hell would you read it?

00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:14,300
That's it. Dude, how do you care about anything this much? What happened to the school tour?

538
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:46,860

00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:51,340
Well, aren't you running off with that? Okay. Are you guys fighting below me right now?

What is happening boomie stop pestering her

542
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:07,180
They're pussies. I'm not afraid to watch someone grovel in pain

543
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:13,660
Well, they're all just assholes that guy's been making fun of me for like an anime since the sixth grade

544
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:16,540
Then just stop liking anime

545
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:21,100
But I can't do that anime is my favorite thing ever my life

546
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:23,340
The voice acting is so good

547
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:26,300
In consumption. Are you trying to make anime? I don't get it

548
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:31,340
Kind of can't interrupt it fan art based on the works of sento takahashi

549
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:35,660
You know that anime will exist with or without you, right? No

550
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:42,620
Wait, what do you mean like senti takamoki would have the fucking mean is he wouldn't care. He wouldn't even know

551
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:47,500
What's your point? How do you give a fuck about anything that doesn't give a fuck about you?

552
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:49,820
Hey in a translated newsletter

553
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:56,220
He said thank you to each and every one of his fans. That includes me. Oh, he writes in english

554
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:02,860
No, his fan club translated into japanese. That's my point. He can't even talk to you. You think he cares about you

555
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,740
Well for the longest time

556
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:12,380
I wasn't allowed to watch anime because again growing up religious my parents saw like a little majority of anime

557
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:17,100
has like demonic undertones in terms of like, oh, she's a demon or oh

558
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:20,300
Magic like I wasn't allowed to read harry potter for the longest time

559
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:24,540
Then I grew up my dad's like, I don't really give a fuck and I'm like, thank you and I read the first book and I'm like

560
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:26,540
This is mid as fuck. Are you kidding me?

561
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:33,660
So I yeah, like I remember I had I said this before in my thank my two point

562
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:39,500
No, I had to like sneak and watch adult swim and like full metal alchemist on mute and Naruto

563
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:43,180
You know the first Naruto episode I watched neji neji dying

564
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:47,100
I was crying at this random anime character. I never formed an attachment to

565
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:49,900
spoiler neji dies, um

566
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:55,180
Going super sane to my well, it's funny because my dad watched dragon ball z

567
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:57,980
so that was fine

568
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:00,060
so like

569
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:03,020
Part one or part two, what do you mean?

570
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:05,820
movies are better

571
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:08,220
like of of what

572
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:09,580
Dory mom

573
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:11,020
No, like

574
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:18,940
Like I was the type of kid that liked the fantasy and like magic stuff. I wasn't like the slice of life kind

575
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:25,020
Like so I wasn't like if I was watching like slice of life anime. I think my parents wouldn't have cared

576
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:28,700
I didn't watch any of that. I didn't want to didn't interest me

577
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:31,660
I'm like, I want to see people fight each other

578
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:34,860
What the heck is going on

579
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:36,620
Chat broke. Oh god

580
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:38,300
Guys, are you with me?

581
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:42,380
You still there breathe breathe deeply. Okay. You're still there

582
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:45,740
I don't watch anime is

583
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:47,740
You should get on that

584
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:49,740
the dark raised me um

585
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:54,860
I always say like I remember my mom was like, oh I hate anime

586
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:59,980
But I think she only said that because like, you know, it was like the thing to hate anime

587
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:03,100
But my dad liked it. So I don't fucking get it. Um

588
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:06,060
It's funny, right?

589
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:10,380
Like I'm like realizing how much like my parents are like, you can't do this thing

590
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:12,380
Then they would just go and do that thing

591
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:17,260
And this is so funny

592
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:23,500
Um, but then my mom saw kiki's delivery service and she fell in love and I'm like what?

593
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:29,420
I'm like, like this is about like a witch who does bake like it's a witch mom

594
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:34,540
Woo, which is the devil and she's just like, but it's cute and then she just ended up not caring

595
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:39,180
My mom. Yeah, my mom's favorite, um studio ghibli film is

596
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:42,380

597
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:46,460
Is a kiki's delivery service and I think my dad's is uh

598
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:49,820
What is it?

599
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:51,820
Uh porco rosco, I can't

600
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,620
I

601
00:47:57,580 --> 00:48:00,620
Yeah, porco rosso. I'm like, it's not rosco rosso

602
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:07,820
Uh, I love toro. I have a lot of toro stuff. Um, I remember I've had like the same toro hoodie for like

603
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:10,620
I'll like 10 years

604
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:13,180
How was moving castle is my personal favorite?

605
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:16,460
I'd rather be a pig than a fascist. Um

606
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:19,420
Be it was the

607
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:24,540
So I said my first studio ghibli movie I ever watched was the cat returns and I fell in love with the cat

608
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:27,420
in the the fun hat

609
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:31,660
And then I watched how was moving castle and I fell in love with howl really hard

610
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:36,060
I like especially like christian like christian bail. I don't

611
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:42,460
Only up until recently like a couple years ago. I didn't know that christian bail voice howl

612
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:44,540
Oh

613
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:49,420
And I yeah, how was moving castle is one of my all-time faves tales of mercy is very good. Yes

614
00:48:50,620 --> 00:49:00,060
My first anime's pokemon. I wasn't allowed to play or watch pokemon because um, I remember being at church and they had this like

615
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:02,060
thing

616
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:04,060
Where they said like oh

617
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:06,140
um

618
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:10,140
Do not be swayed by

619
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:19,180
The kids these days playing their pokemon because it is pocket monsters aka the devil

620
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:25,420
They're demons you based off of demons in japanese culture. They're being glorified and kids

621
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:29,020
Kids media and so I wasn't allowed to

622
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:31,740
play or watch pokemon

623
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:34,700
That I stole a pokemon game from gamestop and I never looked back

624
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:37,260
Uh

625
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:40,860
Pokemon fire red

626
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:42,460
My game boy

627
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:47,980
And then I had um, actually no, I didn't steal from gamestop. I stole it from a kid who brought it to our

628
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:50,780
my after-school program

629
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:57,500
So true sister of the claw and um, yeah, they're like, oh, I'll let you borrow this game. I just never gave it back

630
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:00,060
Yeah

631
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:06,140
And I yeah, I played the I played a lot of pokemon games since and then I also convinced like my

632
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:14,780
Relatives to get me like pokemon games. I'm not like the hugest pokemon fan, but I definitely love it like like it a lot

633
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:20,140
Uh, it was I was definitely it was that and in ton dogs. I played this shit out of

634
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:23,180
Truly the christian way to play pokemon

635
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:26,060
Oh

636
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:28,060
Like so I went to like after school program

637
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:30,860
After school

638
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:36,860
And then like we'd all we'd have like a attack day where we could bring in our like ds's and our game boys and all that shit

639
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:40,220
and um

640
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:42,460
I would just

641
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:46,140
So I like and then like I didn't I didn't have a lot of games because I was broke as fuck

642
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:51,340
I had like my like a wealthier grandparent got me my game boy and my ds

643
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:53,580
And so I would just steal

644
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:01,900
But it was yeah after school program after school. Yeah, exactly

645
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:06,860
That was that that place that place if I didn't go to that place I would be

646
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:13,340
a social outcast because thankfully that place because my parents worked late

647
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:15,660
um

648
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:17,260
Allowed me to

649
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:21,180
Have some social skills. I'm just happy my mom didn't pull me out of high school

650
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:24,620
My freshman year because I almost got pulled because she wanted to homeschool me

651
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:27,420
Because a lot of uh people at my church were doing that

652
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:30,620
And then I end up with fucking

653
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:38,140
A girl like emily magie or whatever the fuck in my church who has doesn't know how to talk to people

654
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:40,300
So I'm happy I didn't turn out like that

655
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:43,260
I'm only supposed to be caught in me

656
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:46,940
Ex-homeschooling. Yeah, definitely dodge the bullet especially because I'm an only child

657
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:49,580
What a fucking sucks man

658
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:54,060
Early stream it's an early stream baby girl

659
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:58,860
Okay, you want to stick to getting beat up over children's media? I'll leave you to it. Wait

660
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:02,460
Oh, yeah, I had the rebellious teen phase my mom fucking hated me

661
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:08,140
Not many people when you're when you're growing up you always knock heads with your parent of the same gender

662
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:10,780
And me my mom definitely knocked heads, but

663
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:12,380
um

664
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:14,380
I love her to death. She's like

665
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:18,460
One of the people I look up to the most in my life aside from my dad

666
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:24,380
My mom's a fucking badass and I thank her every day for putting up the shit. I put her through

667
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:31,500
Or as nice to me as you are that was nice to you god damn it. Yeah, I'm jeffrey by the way. What's your name?

668
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:34,460
Uh, nicole

669
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:35,740
Wow

670
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:38,060
Okay, bye nicole. Yeah. Yeah, okay

671
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:42,940
Oh, you look new the lunch line's on the other end there. Huh?

672
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:48,620
You're trying to find where the lunch line starts, right? You got here a little late. So it's pretty long now

673
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:53,020
Oh, will she appear on stream? Um, my parents said they do want to come on stream at some point

674
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:56,540
Where'd you come in from? Probably just like recorded stuff though because they would probably

675
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:02,700
Docs my whole name address social security number mother's made a name, etc, etc

676
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:06,380
Or like how can he afford someone to add her all with a jab at the shop?

677
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:11,420
Yeah, everybody's everybody's stuff is different. I think like girls usually knock heads with their mothers bull cut

678
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:16,540
That's jeffrey. I don't think he's all there like he's too socially awkward for the normal people

679
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:18,620
But too smart for the special eddies

680
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:24,380
Can I sit here? Yeah, sure. All my friends got put in a different lunch period. One day you'll blow up

681
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:29,180
I'm nicole. I'm gonna be fair. You also had to put up with some shit. That's like all your births

682
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:31,340
Yeah, you know for jessica avi

683
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:35,500
That's pretty cool. I'm unpacked that shit in my therapy sessions. So my parents

684
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:39,820
Even my parents have gotten a lot more lax with that. Like they don't give a shit what I do now

685
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:45,820
I remember they found my tarot cards. They're just like just don't do it in the house. Like it was fucking drugs

686
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:48,540
You ready for day two

687
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:53,260
Is someone gonna kill me day two? If so, absolutely. Why what happened?

688
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:58,540
Just like waking up in general hurts and I got a deal with my brother who's still up from the night

689
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:02,780
Oh, yeah, my parents are pretty cool. They're definitely they were surprisingly. They're way

690
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:07,260
Less strict like 26 other people's parents that I grew up with

691
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:11,020
I mean, we way less strict like if you thought like, oh your parents have been really strict

692
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:15,580
Compared to other people's parents. No, I have to tell them that when I'm woken up by loud chewing noises

693
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:17,820
Is he fat?

694
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:22,220
Do you know what x bodybuilder is your dad's single my parents are happily married

695
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:26,460
Well, he's an obese monster. I was just curious if anyone else

696
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:31,820
Says me. Oh no, I'm hiding all that shit. Let's gossip more at lunch. I gotta get to class

697
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:36,060
Dude, fuck class. Just skip with me. I told you yesterday if I skip anymore

698
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:40,060
My mom's gonna start giving me disciplinary tattoos. Oh god

699
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:45,900
I was largely raised by my grandparents for interactions with my mom and brother's not pleasant

700
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:49,820
Yeah, truly and it's like they also have their own shit. They have to work through

701
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:55,420
Huh do they have an upside down pineapple? Oh my god

702
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:59,340
I only discovered like a couple months ago what that meant. They do not

703
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:04,380
Okay, we're gonna go we're not going to photography

704
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:12,220
Look, it's the first day. No funny guys. No comedians. No bring us to the ha ha, okay

705
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:18,380
This year's gym class isn't last year's gym class. We're gonna really buckle down on physical fitness

706
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:21,580
I ain't buckling shit

707
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:25,980
Young lady. What's your name? Nicole. You want my phone number two?

708
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:30,140
This is only the first class that can bring us up the ha ha ha

709
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:37,980
No, sorry. Good. Now everybody better dress out every class if you don't it's a zero hit the locker rooms

710
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:42,620
I'll see you back. I got negative marks so often because I would constantly

711
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,340
forget to

712
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:48,140
Bring clothes to change into

713
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:54,140
Showing our education system is pure evil. He's even Mario on a shirt. Talk like a cartoon

714
00:55:54,540 --> 00:56:00,140
What do you mean if I talk like a cartoon I'd go. What's up doc? No, it's just general ha ha

715
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:04,140
I'm random cartoon channel talk. Have you ever watched television for adults?

716
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:06,780
What do you mean like porn?

717
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:13,900
I see that there's only two forms of media to watch porn and cartoons

718
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:19,340
Uh

719
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:21,340
Wait, I totally missed what

720
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:25,340
I like some wild porn here and there probably wouldn't handle it

721
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:28,860
Actually, I want to see I want to see if he'll tell me what he watches

722
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:32,060
Most girls just scream and run when I say that

723
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:34,860
I bet he's gonna talk to me about hentai or something

724
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:39,020
Well, are you gonna tell me or not? Why do you want to know?

725
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:47,580
Uh, everybody knows the coolest guys have depraved fetishes. I mean, yeah guys, the coolest guys have depraved fetishes

726
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:50,620
Uh, uh, all right

727
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:56,300
See me on lunch today. Maybe we could talk about it then lunch date with jeffree

728
00:56:57,180 --> 00:57:01,100
Finally someone to share my escape is if you talk about vtubers, that would be peak

729
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:05,740
Yeah, I get lost in all these weird websites to get away from my gun nut stepdad

730
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:11,180
I think he was in iraq or something doesn't matter anyway. Wait. It was stepdad and you don't

731
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:13,900
know if he actually served in iraq

732
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:20,700
That's so that you think like possibly go wrong. What was that? Oh, just I've wanted a chat like this for so long

733
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:24,940
I wanted a chat like this stares at you for so long

734
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,500
Oh, he would like a zura

735
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:48,560
Is jeffree base guys jeffree base

736
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:53,680
Really, uh, is this a is this the average, uh, a zura fan right here?

737
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:58,960
Huh, you know most people hate when they're taken advantage of no, I mean

738
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:01,760
Literally walk all over me

739
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:08,160
Love to be stepped on by a cute tariff feet. Well, hey beat stepping on a scale. Okay, so he's one of my fans too

740
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:12,560
Unfortunately, most of my fetishes can only be realized through my anime

741
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:17,520
The realm of the living isn't quite ready for 50 foot tall vixens

742
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:24,320
Yeah, the real world sucks. We're walking into the jeffree route. Did I mention how I liked girls with cat ears and tails?

743
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,400
What about bunny ears and tails?

744
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:35,600
Oh my god, are we gonna take jeffree's virginity?

745
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:41,280
I'm yawing in his virginity if that's if that's a thing. I'm yawing in it. It's mine

746
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:47,200
I wonder if the library has volume 31 yet. Hey there jeffree. I'm corrupting this anime loser

747
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:54,000
Oh, hello, jacka. Unfortunately jacka. He used my toothbrush to clean out his new assault rifle

748
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,640
He bought from china. How much up much?

749
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:01,120
Anyway, could you find another card? He's been revoked. Sorry, but I can't anymore

750
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:06,960
My mom's been wondering where all my lunch money's been going. Oh, you mean you don't like me anymore

751
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:13,040
Again, I'm sorry. I just don't know. Maybe I should grow 40 feet. Then you don't really like me

752
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:15,120
She told other people

753
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:21,520
Maybe if you took your shoes off and stepped on his face. Oh, no. Oh, no

754
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:29,600
Oh, he's going to do something to the school

755
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:34,720
Oh, yeah, they're kids with the popped up kids

756
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:38,400
Yes, come on. We'll make us purrs. I can't believe this

757
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:46,400
Uh, I was actually very nice to the jeffree in my school because

758
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,600
Well, all along the notes flattering

759
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:55,120
Literally batch it crazy. Like he wasn't like he was nerdy, but he was also like

760
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,400
Like I'm not even joking. He was crazy

761
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:01,840
Uh, like he would have definitely

762
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:05,120
Done bad things

763
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,720
And I remember even it was like that

764
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:10,880
thing

765
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,880
He even told me one time

766
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:17,120
Like thank you. Like you've like a really good friend of mine and that again

767
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:20,240
I was just doing the bare minimum of kindness because I'm I'm gonna be kind to anyone

768
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:23,440
I'm not it's really hard for me to dislike someone and as someone who was bullied

769
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:25,440
I just did not bully other people

770
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:31,200
And he was like, you know, you're one of the good ones and I'm like, oh, thanks redacted and he's like, yeah

771
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:38,240
If I did that, you know that joke of like coming to school with stuff like I definitely like warned you first and I was like

772
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:43,680
What

773
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:46,080
What do you mean

774
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:50,880
And he's like, haha, don't worry about it. And then he just like walked away

775
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:57,600
And then so I used to work at um

776
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:01,840
I used to work at game stop for for a bit

777
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:06,560
Sadly I didn't have any stock in their company

778
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:12,560
But and then he like came in looking for oh, but I will give you stories about when I worked at game stop

779
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:14,160
Don't you worry about that?

780
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:16,160
um, and he came in and

781
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:22,160
It was like really late like we were about to close and he was like, oh my god redacted

782

784
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:32,800
and then um

785
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:35,760
He was like, oh, I want to show you something and then he just

786
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,880
Started showing me hentai on his phone

787
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:46,960
And I look at my manager who he also happened to be friends with and no and mind you my manager was a jeffrey

788
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:49,920
down to the core

789
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:53,840
And he's like as long as you can't see it in the cameras and I'm like

790
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:01,600
I can go home like it's time for me to punch punch out right like

791
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,920
Can I leave

And then you know, I don't know what they did after that because I left. Yeah

793
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,080
Yep

794
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:18,320
Yeah, it's it's it's it's I don't even remember what it was because I glanced at it

795
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:21,520
I generally I can't recall what it was

796
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:23,520
Uh

797
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,520
Yeah, you're working at game stop

798
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,440
What was the trip? You know those things of like the moms coming in and being like hi

799
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,520
I'd like to buy my son the fishing game

and I'm like, oh like what like, um

801
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:38,640
What the fuck is that fishing game called? That's super popular

802
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:42,000
Not compelling. That's the hunting game. But um

803
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,880
And I'm like what she's like cod

804

And she's like it's not but it's called my son. He's like 11. It's called cod. He's like he said he wanted to fish with his friends

01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:38,720
I think she would have caught on when she saw the game cover but

820
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:41,120
I

821
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:45,840
The parents I know like I bet I bet he ended up getting it another way

822
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:50,160
I remember like some kid brought his psp to the my after school program

823
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:55,920
And we all gathered around watching him play gta on the psp and like with the strippers

824
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,400
And we're all like

825
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:04,720
Cod like strong strong is a call fish get it get it right

826
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:10,480
You start a game stop from these stories. You were oh, yeah, and being a girl it was just

827
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:14,080
It was just funny like I would just have like

828
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:17,360
The weirdest dudes hit on me and I'd be like

829
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:24,560
Would you like to sign up for our game stops rewards? Oh if I can get your number

830
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:31,840
Okay, so it looks like you're not signing up for game stop rewards. Let me just check you out

831
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:40,400
Oh, I'm buying BMX access for eight year old son. What? Oh my god

832
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:44,240
Oh my god

833
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:45,360
and like

834
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:51,200
And I was like I was very alternative and like scenish the way I dress so I was just like

835
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:56,160
Just like a seed and goth looking chick just that cave stop

836
01:04:58,800 --> 01:04:59,840
Like

837
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:04,960
Uh really super depressed all the time only got a job because I needed money

838
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,800
And my parents made me get a job because I was in need

839
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:15,040
Oh my god, anyways game

840
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:22,160
Bad bitch on my office door. I'll start tracking who left them if it continues

841
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,880
Well, it definitely wasn't jeffrey. Oh

842
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:30,080
Fuck you are done. Why is it definitely not jeffrey? Because you're not a cat

843
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:38,160
Oh my god, I just noticed the outfit he was wearing Jesus fuck and you should all be ashamed of yourselves

844
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:46,480
Oh, thank you. I was really just because he prefers alternative forms of sexual intercourse does not mean he should be ridiculed

845
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:50,320
Sorry

846
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,240
What do you mean by

847
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:53,120
alternative

848
01:05:53,120 --> 01:06:00,480
Oh god jeffrey here prefers to be stepped on by women who look like cats as opposed to standard intercourse with a human woman

849
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:05,200
Oh my god, this stop. I feel so bad

850
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:11,920
You did this

851
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:13,440
Did what?

852
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:18,320
Told everyone my darkest secret. Oh, he's killing me first. That was in confidence

853
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:22,560
I was hoping we would just like sorry give him a nice lay. I feel bad

854
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:25,920
I haven't touched my manga in forever

855
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:30,640
Not even cartoons entertain me anymore. Oh, he's like talking normal

856
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:33,760
Do you even care?

857
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:39,440
Do the results of your actions mean anything to you? I'm very scared when they affect me. Sure

858
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:46,240
No one in the realm of the living ever liked me anyway. Oh, no, I feel really bad

859
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,480
Damn it, Nicole

860
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:57,840
Because you're gonna fucking shake me

861
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:06,160
No, jeffrey don't do it jeffrey you're based your tastes. You're so based bro

862
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Don't do it home slice

863
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:15,600
Don't kill yourself. You're so sexy

864
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:19,840
Girl hormones make me feel guilty

865
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:22,720
call his bluff

866
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:25,920
Well, I'm I'm getting guilty because I feel like he would actually do it

867
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:30,560
I mean, you don't have to kill yourself over this. Do you?

868
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:35,680
In the realm of the living I am nothing more than a punchline for others amusement

869
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:38,320
This is not the purpose I desired

870
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:41,200
Well, what is

871
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:43,360
I don't know

872
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:45,360
So if you die now, you'll never know

873
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:49,600
Don't try to talk me out of yeah, if I call this bluff. He probably would have shot up the school

874
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:55,760
What are you fool? He thought of the oldest cause never get in the land war between

875
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:01,840
Eight that's the end of the world. What's the line ever get? I literally love the princess bride so much

876
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:08,960
So you want more than missionary big deal? Okay, so it's not the end of the world. It's still the end of my social life

877
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:15,200
Jeffrey what social life all you did was repeating the sweetheart location stop it

878
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:18,320
Stop it

879
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:23,680
So what's the problem seems like everything's going according to plan

880
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:26,960
You know

881
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:28,880
You're right

882
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:34,240
The only thing that's different is everyone knows when you learn like not to care what other people think it's literally life changing

883
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:36,080
They just assumed it

884
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:38,080
Gosh, thanks, Nicole

885
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:40,880
I'm a woman. So I still care about what people think but you know

886
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:44,880
When you mostly stop caring about people

887
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:51,440
Company this is what empathy gets you

888
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:57,120
Come on, I just wanted to sleep with Jeffrey

889
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:59,120
I

890
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:05,200
Nicole I'm trying to make a depression playlist on itunes. What is it? Well nothing really?

891
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:11,120
I'm just wondering why you've been so exhausted lately. I'm depressed mom mom. You're being nice, right?

892
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:17,360
Trying to get along. Yeah, and I'm pretty sure that's my problem never putting up a fight never telling men

893
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:19,360
I'm not their emotional wheelchair

894
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:23,600
Well, sweetie, I'm not sure if being confrontational is the key to happiness

895
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:28,400
Your beautiful girl don't have an ugly personality personality towards anyone

896
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:34,800
So I should like spread myself thin. I don't care what others think or say part of the perk of being a nerd

897
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:40,800
Being a virgin all I'm saying is and having hot girls try to steal your chance

898
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:46,080
What if they're bad people? I don't believe anyone being inherently bad

899
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:50,800
Yeah, I guess the pedophiles trying to abduct me on my space or just misunderstood

900
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:54,400
I remember I tried making a mind space when I was like 10

901
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:59,280
My dad was like no the connections you start early come in handy later

902
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:01,760
Although I was on guy online when I was 10. That was a bad idea

903
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:03,440
Fine

904
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:06,400
Thank you. I promise it'll pay off

905
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
He just becomes Jeff the killer

906
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:19,760
Okay, whatever now my mom's addicted to heroin again

907
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:24,720
Oh, shit. Well, that sucks. I thought everyone would just forget about the hangout promises

908
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:28,480
I made over the winter the thing where you tell them you're really busy for midterms

909
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:32,800
But should have time in the spring. Yeah, I thought most of them would just forget not when you're hot

910
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:37,520
They never forget when you're hot. I'm hot. You fish by the classic

911
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:43,280
I mean when I was 30 making a mind space my dad said no because I'm 56

912
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:47,840
Park or the diner. What kind of Mormon ass bitch meets at a diner

913
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:50,240
They all play together couldn't tell you

914
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:56,400
Worst part is I'm at this point where I'm too nice to even decline the follow-up hangers. Hey, let's do this again

915
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:59,680
Maybe next week same time. Yeah, so now it's the bullshit

916
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:03,040
I put up with on break combined with the bullshit I put up with at school

917
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:07,360
Really makes you question the whole point of nice. I love guy. I asked you about their economy

918
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:10,800
When shit socializing honestly kind of sucks now

919
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:15,760
And nobody plays the game anymore. Yeah, I like logs into my old account

920
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:22,720
Oh my god, you're bad and um, that's like church girl. Nice. I went to like the racing place and like other places

921
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:27,760
Like like nobody's there. He'll just stalk me. I'll be so cynical. I'll probably just murder you

922
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:32,160
Dying would be awesome right now, but I feel like there'd be strings attached with him

923
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:36,560
You're dead. What could he possibly do your body is disappear when you die

924
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:40,160
So whatever his twisted little anime brain wants. Oh, okay

925
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:44,640
But if he actually killed you could I take your body to attack the dermis be pretty sick

926
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:51,440
Good to know. Hell yeah, we're all on the same page. Did you end up on habo? I like I think when I played habo hotel like once

927
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:57,760
I mostly stuck to gaya and neopets

928
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:05,440
And wet paint and real players guilt. It's just been wild crazy. That's the fourth time you said that

929
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:07,520
Oh, uh

930
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:10,880
Pretty sweet. Your mom's out of town. You could throw a whole party, right?

931
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:15,120
Are you gonna throw a party people enough to let them destroy my house? Then yeah, absolutely

932
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:20,480
Oh, man, don't be a downer. Do you kind of remind me of this one girl from a local punk band around here?

933
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:23,360
She kind of gets a penguin. Hell yeah, I was

934
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:30,000
You want to this fucked up shit I used to do so

935
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:33,760
I usually like

936
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:39,120
Uh, I growing up. I don't know why I did this, but I posed as a boy

937
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:40,960
on

938
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:42,960
a club penguin

939
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:46,080
I remember I

940
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:49,680
posed as a as a boy and I was like my name's kyle

941
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:52,400
and then

942
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:54,400
I made another account

943
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:59,600
Called sky and she was my sister

944
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:04,000
So I

945
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,920
kyler

946
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:07,520
so I would

947
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:09,600
Switch between the accounts

948
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:14,800
And I would pretend to be a bro to the people I played with and then I would switch to be a girl

949
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:17,760
And they would tell me they have a crush on my sister aka me

950
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:21,120
and then

951
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:29,280
I was so but like I was like, I don't even know how old it was doing that. I would I lark to siblings often

952
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:34,880
I guess I was just so manhara as a child and I really wish I had a sibling that I could

953
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:38,080
fuck people over with because even you know when I played counter strike

954
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:41,360
I I put like because I could do my guy voice

955
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:49,360
And then I would say oh you want to hear my like my sister wants to play and then I'd switch to my normal voice and then people

956
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:59,600
People would believe it because you know mics back then were terrible. There's two wolves inside me my two fake siblings

957
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:01,680
A

958
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:07,040
Two fake the girl and boy siblings the the and the andy and the

959
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:12,480
Andy and ashley. Oh my fucking god. They were literally andy and ashley

960
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:20,560
Not the realization is bro still single. I don't know

961
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:24,080
Bro, I was crazy as fuck like

962
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:26,000
like

963
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:30,720
When I was a kid, no, I'm not gonna get it. I'll have to get into that and like a zassi stream just like

964
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:33,280
my tulpas

965
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:38,800
We should play that. Oh, I've already I've actually already played through confident mandy and lele

966
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:42,320
But I'm totally be down to play it again. And then the next episode come comes out

967
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:45,360
Back when I was a priestess

968
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:50,640
She does something soon of her did uh, she does something soon of her. She's something similar. I'm not surprised

969
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:53,840
She'd be your ways to indulge your sister for a corner

970
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:58,240
Leave me alone

971
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:08,080
People were people were like I thought she was based because of how I responded to a marrow when it's real life

972
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:10,160
I just don't like it. I'm sorry

973
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:16,400
Previews for episode three. Oh, I haven't even seen the previews

974
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:21,440
Uh, emmy's playing coffin of andy and lele today, isn't she?

975
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:27,040
So you guys will have a little treat you guys will get a little treat you want to treat you want to treat

976
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:29,200
You know a little treat then

977
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:31,280
I also really like to take her in kairu

978
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:34,080
for more in high school

979
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:35,760

Uh, time flies when you're a big titty dandy McGraw on the internet. Um, but yeah

I have to keep logging in to my schedule

1006
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:33,360
Fanfiction oh fuck what is that?

1007
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:37,920
Can't read

1008
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,440
Three days. Okay. Well, yeah, I'm putting up that tweet today because it's on the 10th

1009
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:44,240

1010
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:49,920
Goku and Anne like Anne Frank

1011
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:53,360
You're fucking with me. Are you serious?

1012
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:56,400
SCPs. Oh, yeah, that'd be cool

1013
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:05,040
Thing just more like the band makes her image that

1014
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:09,040
I like how I'm gonna like not stream for like a couple hours and come back

1015
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:16,000
Has it really only been 20 minutes? Hey, I just want to let you know

1016
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:18,800
You're actually really pretty

1017
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:22,880
I know pretty and like pretty cool, too

1018
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:27,360
You taste music. It's like it's like nothing I've ever heard before you really know your stuff

1019
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:30,320
No, I don't I had Sean Kingston

1020
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:32,320
Oh

1021
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:35,760
You're different

1022
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:41,600
I'm not having sex with you an actual name. Yes talking about fucking you was like the last thing very correct

1023
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:49,040
You've worn the same volcom socks for like two weeks. I'm looking to fight strong guys. I heard imperial germany is pretty

1024
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:51,360
It's cool if it is

1025
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:59,840
Why are we at davin busters? Yeah, it might seem crowded now, but you should see this place

1026
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:05,840
Am I just like speed dating everybody? I said you should see this place on friday. It's friday. Okay

1027
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:11,360
You see me at the hoops machine. I'm sick. You couldn't keep up. I like she's like actually

1028
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:17,440
Hanging out with everybody 17 after all and the ski ball suicidal pregnancy. Don't take it too hard

1029
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:24,640
I make everyone look trash at it. All of this. I don't mind davin busters. All right. Yeah, tell the pussy ass bitches to suck my dick

1030
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:27,840
I think I should start making rap songs. My dad is a mac book

1031
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:32,400
I love it

1032
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:41,920
Poor speedrun, but yeah season four not really for me personally. How about you? Sorry season four of what now the doki-dice-ki anime

1033
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:48,000
You've been paying attention right to the first three seasons or are you talking for the last 20 minutes?

1034
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:51,360
Actually, it's the same answer for both. Yeah, I know

1035
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:53,840
What were the writers thinking?

1036
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:56,960
I'm actually involved with an online group and we're gonna reanimate

1037
01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:00,880
Come on, you won't let me take this boy's virginity like a whole hand it over

1038
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:04,320
Yeah, let me corrupt this little nerd use all the help we could get

1039
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:07,680
I guess animation takes a lot of time, right?

1040
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:12,800
At least we don't have time to stream with audio. That's actually audible. Actually, we haven't found an

1041
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:18,480
Is that supposed to mean yeah, but one of our friend's cousins might do it after he graduates from media school

1042
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:21,680
You turn Nicole into a pushover. I really fucking did. Yeah, just for the love of the show

1043
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:25,680
Well, honestly, it's good for her because she needs more friends and they're open. Why not her?

1044
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:29,600
There's no difference whether I join or not join because this will never be made

1045
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:32,320
Well, if you feel that way

1046
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:36,160
Do you know why it's so hard to find animators? I don't know why the fuck I'm here

1047
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:41,920
I even had to pay for my own shitty cheeseburger. I'm gonna start telling men. I'm vegan so they stop trying to take me places

1048
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:45,360
That's pretty pretty good strat

1049
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:51,360
But yeah, Kelly's a fucking whore and I hope she dies end of discussion. Goddamn. I'm not opposed to that stance. How about you, Nicole?

1050
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:59,520
Nicole, huh? Oh, sorry. I'm the exhausted somehow socially burnt out like her

1051
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:07,920
Poor new kid. It's like, you know, they want to fuck but they won't just ask so you can reject them

1052
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:10,560
I know right like you guys

1053
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:15,760
Are made to serve me and you know, make me my food and buy me my food. Thank you for reminding me

1054
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:21,360
About it. Let's just enjoy your cancerous meatloaf in peace. I'm sorry

1055
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:26,560
Oh, Nicole. What's up? Who's still on for tonight? Fucking chrisbin

1056
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:30,480
Why is it all guys? Why am I not hanging out with girls?

1057
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:35,760
Cole concert's gonna be sick with you there. The government is bad that concert was tonight

1058
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:43,200
You are exhausted. I was playing literal. No bodies. Just cover bands. You can say no. Oh my god

1059
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:44,560
To say no

1060
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:48,400
Yeah, someone told me they saw you at a place with that weird japan kid. Japan kid

1061
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:51,200
Well, you actually went through with that. You need to have some kind of limit

1062
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:55,840
How can I rank who and who not to hang out with when they're all equally shitty to me?

1063
01:21:56,400 --> 01:22:00,880
Just are you suicidal? Don't hang out with anyone. Just hang out with the girls

1064
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:03,920
Seriously though. Yes. Why would that cell be rubby?

1065
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:08,080
Same. Open your mouth. Don't let them stick your feet in there.

1066
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:12,640
Maybe you should just blow off that concert. I won't hear the end of it

1067
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:16,160
It's facts. Can't please everyone.

1068
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:22,880
Also facts. Good strat. Uh, I'm gonna stay home and kill myself

1069
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:28,480
I think that's a pretty good idea

1070
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:39,120
I like she's like I'm going zero to a hundred. I don't want to go to a concert. I'm gonna kill myself

1071
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:42,880
Say no, whatever. I want to die. It doesn't matter how

1072
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:46,640
I don't understand

1073
01:22:58,160 --> 01:23:00,160
Oh my god, she went through it with that

1074
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:07,280
What did I even do what did she do?

1075
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:12,560
My daughter attempted suicide. There's blood everywhere, police said

1076
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:14,560
Did the old slice and dice?

1077
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:21,040
My 13th reason oh my god, like happy happy

1078
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:28,480
13 reasons why I was so fucked up. I actually I like the book was good. I didn't like seeing it in person

1079
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:35,840
Mom had me locked up in a mental ward until my 18th birthday. So I learned what crazy pills actually do to you

1080
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:38,560
They don't make anyone happier

1081
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:40,640
Just more content with limbo

1082
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:46,320
What sucks worse than killing yourself is fucking up. Can't wait to get fainzily because I just want to bang people and I can't

1083
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:48,320
Bang anybody in this game shot for eternity

1084
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:50,960
You're just really awkward to hang out with

1085
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:54,480
Can't wait to play hoonipop. Oh

1086
01:23:54,720 --> 01:23:57,760
We were playing hoonipop so fast those games. I've been sitting

1087
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:05,120
Covered in dust in my steam library for years. I have never I've seen gameplay. I know the premise

1088
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:09,440
I have never played the game myself though. I bought them. I bought

1089
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:12,640
I literally I think I bought every hoonipop game because they're on sale

1090
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:16,640
All right

1091
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:19,280
Make

1092
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:21,280
Yeah, I'm I'm speedrunning everything

1093
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:25,040
We're gonna cut close this time

1094
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:32,160
Well, wait most I've ever met would mean you stand out in some way. You're a very run-of-the-mill waste of time

1095
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:36,720
I was at the first ending. I went to some street. It's the first time we played it

1096
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:40,160
I don't want you to talk about us first you wear classic rock t-shirts from walmart

1097
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:44,000
Remember to play it uncensored and cover it with stream overlay and then fail a few times

1098
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:49,520
Well, if it's on fans, it's gonna be uncensored. Cool rapid fire of assumptions. Tell me if I get any wrong

1099
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:51,120
I'm not gonna like

1100
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:56,000
Fuck around that. Take pictures of your skin. I know like mostly. I know the girls just want to get our fans

1101
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
These so that we can play

1102
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:00,880
naughty games

1103
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:02,560
Well

1104
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:05,360
All right, I'll see you later then. I also call it honey pop

1105
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:09,600
Hey, I've seen your ass around here before honey pop. It's my first day. Are you sure about that?

1106
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:12,880
Whatever all you hot girls look to say. Yeah, I think maybe that's what I got it

1107
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:16,320
What it was like gotta be really really cutting under this school security

1108
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:21,120
It's a lot of air. I've actually never played energy games to be honest. Are you bad bitch or what?

1109
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:27,200
I'm an abysmal bitch like the closest thing I got to playing energy games was like really bad cheerleading

1110
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:29,940
Doesn't visual novels without tommy games

1111
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:35,760
Last season we went seven and five like above 500 not bad. It's my life pretty much

1112
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:42,240
How can you make lacrosse your life? There's no pro league for it. Is there is there? Well, I'm sure they're out there

1113
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:47,040
Besides we only lost like five games because I fucked my knee up and couldn't play the rest of the season

1114
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:53,280
It's pretty bad ass because they keep giving me percussa. Cool. Seriously. How much my younger self would be horrified

1115
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:58,400
Elephant I got them right here. You want to do it with me? They only know I think my younger self would be like damn

1116
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:00,400
You are cool as fuck

1117
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:01,760

1118
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:05,840
Should we pop some percussets percusset molly percusset

1119
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:12,560
Did I didn't know that song did it in the net should we decline the free drugs? So we say no to drugs kids

1120
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:15,360
Are we popping them perks?

1121
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:20,160
Flute

1122
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:24,400
Pop them pop. All right, we pop perks free percusset. Hell. Yeah, hand it over

1123
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:27,920
This is actually my mexican cartel supply, but it probably won't kill you

1124
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:35,520
My feet feel great. I could fall asleep standing right now. Yeah, I told you it was good shit

1125
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:42,080
I'm sorry. Are we lost? Both of you should be in class. This isn't a skip. Why do we just like have it sell out?

1126
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:49,920
In his pocket in his pants hiding there my dick. Oh shit prescription pills. Who's are these?

Huh pin it on the other guy. I don't really get these

Am I gonna pin it on kyler?

1131
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:08,960
Or i'm just not gonna say anything at all

1132
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:17,200
No, i'm not gonna go down. I'll go down with him. I'm gonna snitch. I ain't no fucking snitch, bro

1133
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:22,400
In trouble. Fuck you. I'm not in anything. Uh, yeah, you definitely are in trouble

1134
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:27,280
Well, you're in the model train fan club. You freak. I'm not in the model train fan club

1135
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:34,000
I just sponsored the model train fan club. That's even worse. No snitching. You look new here. I'm not sure what you think you're doing

1136
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:39,760
If I can assure you it won't last long. A bitch can't pop perks here. What the fuck? What if I have glaucoma?

1137
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:46,000
But you don't have glaucoma and you just confessed to drug use on school grounds. Come with me both of you

1138
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:48,880
glaucoma?

1139
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:54,240
Honey their background sound. Yeah, it's fucking AC. A two-day suspension on the first day of school

1140
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:58,960
It was like one pill. He's just mad. I made him feel insecure. So he threw the book at me

1141
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:05,280
Look, I know you're acting out because of your father mom. Literally. No one ever has actively thought I'm gonna act out today

1142
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:08,400
What does that even mean? I'm gonna look like disrespecting my parents

1143
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:12,960
This is a world you and everyone who crochet is created. She kind of has a point with that, bob

1144
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:15,680
You kind of need to get a fucking job. You're 26

1145
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:22,240
I told you the economy's bad blame bush and these girls I chat with online fully agree

1146
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:28,400
Mom still I can't believe you're taking the school side with this. It's totally against all my citizen rights

1147
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:33,440
They had you sign something that waves those rights. You're 16. You don't even have rights

1148
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:39,440
Well, you do right through the school or something. You're at the only public school for miles and miles

1149
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:43,840
What happens if you're gone for good, huh? I'm not moving again. I'm not paying for private school

1150
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:45,920
And I'm definitely not home

1151
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:48,480
Fine, I won't blow it then. I won't squeal a bit

1152
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:53,200
I was your dream. I saw your friends in Dallas, but I won't say a word because we got to stay in this shithole

1153
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:58,240
Good. I'm glad we understand each other mom. I could just get assaulted. You wouldn't care

1154
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:03,600
You've been pulling the sexual assault card since you were 12 hasn't happened yet. Has it Jesus Christ

1155
01:29:04,160 --> 01:29:09,040
Point well, you can figure out a new excuse locked in your bedroom for the next two days

1156
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:12,480
Fine. I have my own computer grounding doesn't do shit anymore

1159
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:26,240
You're gonna be seriously failing now

1160
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:30,880
Seriously, you may fail. Those boys don't even go together. You sound like an idiot

1161
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:36,080
Look, I'm just recording a little voice message for this hottie I met online that I'm done, okay?

1162
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:40,560
This is like the fifth hottie in two days. Do you know how old any of these girls are? Yikes

1163
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:45,680
Like legal in her country. Don't worry about it. Oh my god. This is bad

Do I help my brother groom a girl or do

1172
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:36,160
Or do I allow him and get him to jail or do I just distract him?

1173
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:42,800
Why do you want me to help him?

1174
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:49,840
Don't joke about it if you have to delete this one too. I don't know what you're talking about

01:35:58,640 --> 01:36:00,640
Brutal reveal. No, I forget her name is

01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:06,160
Tell him that off. I mean he waited for you

1254
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:56,800
I always don't. I don't want to get claimed

1255
01:37:00,640 --> 01:37:02,640
Why was he taken a while?

1256
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:06,000
Hi booby. Hi, it's your boy. What's up?

1257
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:08,800
Hello, how do you do it?

1258
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:12,320
Who'd you make that for all you two folks? We call him Bayman

1259
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:18,480
I also call him Mr. Titties because he has a big power show with boobs. He'll probably see it on the cat ham

1260
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:23,200
Hi, hi cat. Oh, you're so snuggly

1261
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:26,320
Chris, Bea and Rayla

1262
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:32,400
Wait, let me walk over and see what you guys are talking about

1263
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:39,120
Okay, everybody's so far saying no, it's 50-50. Are you serious? Okay

1264
01:37:40,720 --> 01:37:43,920
Never talk to the dude hangs around in girls toilets. What do you mean?

1265
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:49,120
You want to talk to a dude that hangs around in girls toilets? You just, you know, try to be friends

1266
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:52,480
Oh, your boyfriend can't let you go friends

1267
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:54,480
I

1268
01:38:00,160 --> 01:38:03,440
Love this teapot so fucking much you guys don't have any idea

1269
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:13,520

01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:18,960
And my British fans don't hate me as much

1272
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:21,920
You get like little coasters

1273
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:31,600
You can actually hear all of that. Well, yeah, because my house is small and it's an open concept apartment

1274
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:35,200
My kitchen is literally like 10 feet away

1275
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:48,640
Wait, did you I usually microwave tea but some lovely uh, subby Wubby some lovely member of the harem um got me a

Okay, wait, I walked away. It was no and I come back and it's yes

1280
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:05,520
You want me to humor him?

01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:09,920
All right

1282
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:11,920
All right, some Brit some Brit

1283
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:18,480
You see the ASMR when Nicole who's he paws support over if he he interests his voice like what?

1284
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:22,400
I'm a poor roommate having to listen to she be making

1285
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:27,600
Uh, she beneath audio is great

1286
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:36,560
Yes guidance counselor, let's talk it up. Hey, come on. No need for the jokes splitting hairs in the pool

1287
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:40,720
Oh, yeah, I'm gentle. I don't know what jealous, but

1288
01:39:41,680 --> 01:39:43,280
It's because I'm American face and stuff

1289
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:46,880
Although my mom like I had a girl having to cut all the entire time because my mom really likes tea

1290
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:50,640
My mom is like very British despite not being British although we are of English

1291
01:39:50,640 --> 01:39:52,640
So my mom is English

1292
01:39:54,400 --> 01:39:56,400
She's like I want to be English person

1293
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:59,840
In a good way people don't understand me like this girl

1294
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:05,360
She can't do a first act though a pop punk and was like I thought punk was anti-pop like she didn't understand

1295
01:40:05,680 --> 01:40:08,880
I would have told you the same thing pop punks for boring suburban kids

1296
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:15,440
I used to love listening to pop goes punk like I feel like no one at my favorite cover is boyfriends

1297
01:40:16,160 --> 01:40:18,320
By issues when they covered just a fever

1298
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:21,280
I don't know. There's got to be more out there

1299
01:40:21,680 --> 01:40:25,840
Or a lollipop by a single thing. I can't handle the conversation

1300
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:31,920
You're English. It's not huh. I'm a lot of things so much a conversation. I'm lily. I'm everything besides Asian

1301
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:37,360

Then again, he kind of just put himself out there like that

1317
01:41:50,640 --> 01:41:52,960

Oh, hey chrisbin. Yeah, I would have but my after school time was kind of short

1333
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:34,000
Yeah, it wasn't long at all, right? Oh, suck see here, bro. What happened literally everyone at school see your micro penis

1334
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:47,360
Why is the principal so hot like she looks like a new pop character

1335
01:43:50,080 --> 01:43:54,720
Crispin's been sending out pictures of his junk to every girl in school. That's not how I heard it

1336
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:58,560
I thought it was just one girl and then she sent it to everyone

1337
01:43:59,120 --> 01:44:01,440
Who was it then? Tell me chrisbin gonna kill me

1338
01:44:02,160 --> 01:44:04,400
This is a the new girl nicole

1339
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:12,720
Sexually harassing our new students. You're in big trouble. Mr. He thought she was gonna look like it was gonna defend her

1340
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:17,840
Oh, fuck nicole. Call the teacher from honeybob. We need to talk about oh god

1341
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:21,760
Not you too your principal called and told me there was a problem at school

1342
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:27,440
A boy sent you some unsolicited pictures mom. This is gross. I'm not talking about it with you

1343
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:32,960
You were forced to look at sexual imagery nicole the child psychologist say that can really stunt development

1344
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:37,520
Every day I'm thankful the principal's fat titty. So like I never worked again

1345
01:44:39,120 --> 01:44:43,440
I didn't have any friends. I was a loser. So I never had to go through something like that

1346
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:50,240
She views literally jesse who knew pop. I'm apparently so I've been compared to her before

1347
01:44:50,640 --> 01:44:55,680
Especially just like it looks because we do look very similar. Um, I feel like she would wear my outfit

1348
01:44:57,200 --> 01:44:59,520
But like I've had like uh

1349
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:02,560
classmates who receive that stuff

1350
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:05,840
and

1351
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:10,160
I like they were like, oh, I got this from this person and I'm like, what does that mean?

1352
01:45:10,160 --> 01:45:12,800
They're like, but you don't know what that is shows picture of me

1353
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:23,120
Like this also, um, one of the girls and one of my classmates growing up her mom was a porn star

1354
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:29,840
And we all found out in high school because

1355
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:37,600
And I'm not fucking joking her boyfriend at the time found a video

1356
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:43,120
Of the mom I'm born

1357
01:45:44,560 --> 01:45:51,280
And spread it to the school and she was gone like this and the girl is sweet too. She's sweet like her daughter

1358
01:45:52,160 --> 01:45:54,720
And she was gone for like a month. She did not show up

1359
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:56,960
And then I remember

1360
01:45:56,960 --> 01:46:01,360
She told me or like told some girl that told me or whatever the fuck because I just like knew everything

1361
01:46:02,080 --> 01:46:05,120
People would just tell me stuff because I was quiet and I'm a good listener

1362
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
and she told me uh

1363
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:13,520
That oh and her mom is hot though. Like her mom was hot. Um, and she drove a really nice car

1364
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:18,240
I like I didn't see the video, but I I saw like the mom like drop her off. Um

1365
01:46:19,440 --> 01:46:21,440
Yeah, Amy and chat

1366
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:26,560
Amy's also going crazy with the rest of you. Um, and she

1367
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:33,200
Said that she walked in at her parent and not her parents like her mom and some random guy and it was like

1368
01:46:34,080 --> 01:46:40,960
Her parents had had this agreement. I don't know the video. I never saw them. Why would I shit? I don't even remember the mom's name

1369
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:48,960
That's fucked. I would never do that the hell but yeah, it's just like that's why I kind of feel bad for

1370
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:54,640
Some kids growing up and like the only fans era where every girl

1371
01:46:55,840 --> 01:47:00,800
Excuse me is doing only fans especially like some like moms trying to make ends meet

1372
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:04,560
Are their kids because then it just like gets spread to the kids

1373
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:07,280
And it just saw I just feel bad for them

1374
01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:10,160
But then like I know why the moms are doing it because they're trying to you know

1375
01:47:11,280 --> 01:47:13,600
Make money to live, but then I'm like, oh

1376
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:18,320
Honey needs to go to therapy that the little baby needs to go to therapy

1377
01:47:20,240 --> 01:47:22,240
Lisa's pay wall. Yeah

1378
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:28,160
It's gonna do you sold images and we're gonna go to the machine friend. Yeah

1379
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:31,360
Yeah, it's like some people it could be fun. Yeah, like one of my um

1380
01:47:32,240 --> 01:47:34,560
Uh close like church friends growing up

1381
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:41,360
And I didn't know like a lot of the girls in my church were like leading double lives because I was a little good at mischievous and um

1382
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:44,960
Her stuff got spread

1383
01:47:45,200 --> 01:47:46,080
and

1384
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:48,880
She got excommunicated because of it and I was

1385
01:47:49,360 --> 01:47:53,280
Really heartbroken because she was like my closest friend because she was like a little bit normal

1386
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:55,920
Um

1387
01:47:56,240 --> 01:47:58,800
And I never was able to talk to her again

1388
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:03,200
I stumbled across her like her her page at one point

1389
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:07,440
And seeing where she was at and I gave a little high but like yeah

1390
01:48:09,200 --> 01:48:14,240
Yeah, it was like like that shit ruins lives and like none of the the boys that spread it

1391
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:16,080
um

1392
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:18,080
Got in trouble only she did

1393
01:48:18,080 --> 01:48:20,080
Because they were like, oh you harlots

1394
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:22,480
get got

1395
01:48:22,480 --> 01:48:27,200
And they like interrogated her deeply about like what she sent. So the fucking

1396
01:48:28,640 --> 01:48:30,640
pastors or freaks too

1397
01:48:31,520 --> 01:48:33,520
That's another reason I left

1398
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:38,960
All over the goddamn place. This isn't about her. Oh, yeah, no, they're and they're still fine to this day guys

1399
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:41,520
This was very serious

1400
01:48:43,120 --> 01:48:44,720
Uh

1401
01:48:44,720 --> 01:48:47,040
Exaggerate trauma with pity. Oh hell yeah

1402
01:48:47,440 --> 01:48:55,040
Mom I really don't know give me some pretty gifts mom. Oh sweetie. What happened? It's okay. You can tell me

1403
01:48:55,600 --> 01:49:01,920
You won't be mad. No, you didn't do anything wrong. Yeah, that's weird a lot of like a lot of shit happened around me

1404
01:49:02,480 --> 01:49:09,040
But never to me like I had a fairly normal childhood minus like having

1405
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:11,200
religious stuff

1406
01:49:11,200 --> 01:49:13,200
like I wanted to school

1407
01:49:13,440 --> 01:49:15,440
Uh, what did I have to go program?

1408
01:49:15,680 --> 01:49:21,440
I did some like hobbies like my mom put me in extracurriculars like I did okay grades

1409
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:25,440
You know, I went through depression like everybody and their mom does lately

1410
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:27,120
um

1411
01:49:27,120 --> 01:49:29,440
Because the meadow ill in the way runs in my family

1412
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:31,840
But then and then I'm just like now I'm here

1413
01:49:32,640 --> 01:49:35,440
And like got a job and you know and now I'm a vtuber

1414
01:49:36,080 --> 01:49:40,080
But like everything like but I heard a lot like again. I was a good listener. I was quiet

1416
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:50,480
Oh, he sent me the picture and just wouldn't stop texting me

1417
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:52,960

You're gonna take care of that tomorrow now. What else?

1420
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:06,720
Well, the next day at school he was way too confident with me. He's just pinning me against the locker and

1421
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:09,360
Licking my earlobes

Oh, this is the hardest part of being a mom. I swear. I'm sorry. I'm a disappointment mom

1425
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:29,520
I'd want a daughter who gets a's on math tests instead of d's to the face

1426
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:34,320
Okay, is there any way I can make this better anything at all

I'm on the assisted income lunch plan. So they knew she couldn't afford a lawyer
