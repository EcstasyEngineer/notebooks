You

14
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:30,940
I was muted the entire time. Oh, hey, how's it going? Hello, I was talking this entire time

15
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:38,580
Hello, hello, welcome in those who

Vanilla right now, so

18
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:55,080
Don't feel if you really want to watch that. Holy cool thing. Don't gotta worry

19
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:07,560
I just like I was thinking like what am I gonna do when I get off and I'm like

20
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:11,340
I will take me like 15 minutes to do my dishes. So

21
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,940
Might as well just keep going

22
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:21,820
Yeah, I was insulting you guys for a very long time

23
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,460
Um

24
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:31,900
Sucks that you couldn't hear how much I was insulting you. I was really really dominant you there

25
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:35,260
I didn't even pee because I was setting up stream and everything. That's not the pee

26
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:41,020
Changed my hair to be emo. Yeah, you know, I had to fit the theme of my um the

27
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,380
The fan fiction stream, you know

28
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,700
I'm so sorry you guys missed all that

29
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:53,820
You pee, you know, there's no it's I don't it's not it's probably not gonna be an endurance stream

30
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,820
I'll probably only stream for like a couple hours

31
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:02,780
Maybe who knows who knows what's the day monday? Okay, because I'm like, I know I have something to do on wednesday

32
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,780
I have to have to go to a doctor's appointment

33
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:09,260
Um, so I can't say I'm too late tomorrow night. So

Emo cult mommy, that's me

Not at all

39
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,300
Let me just make sure everything's working as it should be

40
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,580
Oh

41
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:51,660

Where is it

00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,460
Regret that I just realized I skipped

00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:01,020
Orange and I went straight to the water one. No, I really think of it

It's a pretty oh, thank you. Tell my hello. Tell my how are you?

54
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,220
Yeah, I'm feeling pretty pale and gothic

55
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,900
Very white right now

56
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,780
Is it working? I don't know if it's working properly

57
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:24,860
Okay, yeah, that's cool. All right, hold on. We're back. We're gonna pee and then fall asleep for a second

58
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,900
So

59
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,900
So

60
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,900
So

61
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,780
So

62
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:25,420
A cold cracking cracking a cold one with the boys accidentally said crapping

63
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,420
Can I wash my hands? No, I live life on the edge

64
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,460
Want to lick and smell my fingers

65
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,420
Oh

66
00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:00,780
All right, we are locked in loaded boys and if you die while I was

67
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,460
Oh

68
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,900
Whoa

69
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,980
You're welcome. Why are you wearing a hat?

70
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,980
Oh

71
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:40,380
Oh, you're starving. Who is this serenity? I can't let serenity starve

72
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,940
Oh, I don't have any food

73
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:54,460
Okay, I can I can do that because I have the faith for it

74
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,260
Serenity go eat something

75
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:14,460
And then when their faith those goes down, I'll then I'll do a sermon big brain only if Cheeto dust is involved

76
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,100
I chat froze

77
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,740
It's not like you guys have anything important to say except for toma

78
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,740
Oh

79
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,860
You have important stuff to say debatable

80
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,500
debatable

81
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,660
Do you're not seeing anything of importance right now?

82
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:55,260
You're all repeating yourselves. All right, fuck that bird

83
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:09,900
Oh my god, I still have so much shit to do. I just realized I got to make a fertilizer silo

84
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:14,060
Then I got to make the scarecrow. I don't have enough lumber

85
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,180
Oops, sorry mercy

86
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:26,940
I have 69 points. Let's get it

87
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:34,940
Chat cannot cool when I get like the cook the actual cooking station they can cook

88
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:46,140
No uprising no uprisings in the harem of st. Bum

89
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:55,820
Not allowed. Why is my head so low? I'm just like peek peeking out

90
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,980
Alrighty, let's go

91
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,860
All right, that's good, that's good

92
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,940
Put some seeds in there

93
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,060
Excuse me

94
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:17,420
Wow, I didn't burp the last stream did I I remember

00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,660
Because I just had some seltzer water

96
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,620

Wait, was there I see is dead. No, she's not

Oh, that's just it's a different form of icy

106
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,740
I might use old ic's body for food then

107
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:12,700
Yeah, it was it was a subtle burp. I wasn't I didn't force it. Um

108
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:17,260
I'm not even gonna bother making myself any food because there's nothing to eat

109
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,060
All right

110
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,500

All right, so I gotta bring plumber when I have a witness

114
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,300
I forgot to put seeds in the silo. I just remembered

Okay, I should be able to make a berry bowl now

124
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,420

00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:28,380
Uh, if I repair that I don't think that'll count as housing the homeless

129
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,300
Demonic hammer

00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,740
Sometimes it's hard to like

168
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,940
Aim

169
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:42,140

Relic beast I see she must have seen so though creation because destruction

253
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:36,860
Hatched as we were in the bosom of the last first gods to bestow godly instruments and yet never wield them ourselves as these are demands

254
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:40,620
Some place I feel darkness something with me now in the belly of some great beastie

255
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:43,180
And through their bones laughter

256
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:45,340
Seek this relic in this place

257

Oh, of course you fuckers change the divine blast on me. I knew the moment I said it that somebody was gonna change it

384
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:39,420
I

385
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:54,380
Like the phantom one too though, it's not bad. So they attack

386
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:56,380

00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:29,980
Fuck you. Why did you hurt me?

393
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:42,220
At least they're like shooting in one direction

394
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:52,620
At least I have the breakable ones like a lot of stone this way

395
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:58,220
Hey, I need to go by I need to sell stuff. I need to get more tarot cards

396
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:02,940
One of my pet peeves is what people call tarot cards tarot cards

397
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:14,540
Although I get it

398
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:19,580
Oh, he gave me divine blast back or something else. I don't know what that was

399
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:25,260
What is the relic I need to

400
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:29,260
I never completed that last time I played

401
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:41,100
I looked that up one of you guys can look that up for me. What the relic kudai is asking about

402
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:56,140
Okay, okay, do you know tarot is not a game

403
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:03,660
Just so you know don't recommend treating tarot as a game

404
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:10,620
Because you can do accidentally do some fucked up shit if you do that

405
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:15,740
There's someone who is knowledgeable about reading tarot cards

406
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:25,820
Watch 100% get rid of any more relics. I'm gonna go this way. Maybe the relic is over here

407
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:36,220
Oh

408
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,820
Why did you just I didn't even press anything you just stopped talking

409
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:50,780
All right

410
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:56,860
Fuck oh I need more money

411
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:01,580
God damn it

412
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:06,540
God damn it

413
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:20,140
It's a follower meet because I want to be able to do the thing where we can eat each other

414
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:29,420
All right, let me just look that up real quick. Yeah, don't treat weija weija

415
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:33,420
Ouija boards

416
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:36,460
Weija Ouija

417
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:43,740
Ouija you're Ouija. Um, it's a cavey that guy because you'll just invite some fucked up shit into your home

418
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:51,420
What is kudai

419
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:55,020
Not kudai

420
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:00,460
Why is a pee

421
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:03,580
Uh cult

422
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:05,660
Oh

423
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:32,380
Okay interesting

424
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:41,340
Uh, yes, I actually I can read tarot. Um, I liked doing tarot card readings

425
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:49,660
When I was a priestess in another life, I did a lot of occult stuff. I did a lot of occult research for people. I um

426
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:53,980
Uh

427
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:56,300
Like I did like the pagan

428
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,500
Uh

429
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:04,860
Pagan roots of like holidays every time there was a holiday. I did a video on it. They'll just I mean stream on it

430
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:07,820
It's really fun

431
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:11,020
I'll probably only do that though

432
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:16,780
When I do it with emmy because I just feel like I wouldn't fit my content if I did it

433
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:21,740
I'm also like that's any content. There's a lot of reasons why people thought I was gonna be emmy because she was the occult one

434
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,500
I'll give me some rocks

435
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:38,300
Yeah, tarot's before yes, uh, come on. No, Sarah as well. Yeah, one day. Maybe a collab with emmy

436
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:42,300
I remember tarot in a while

437
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:51,340
The last time I remember tarot for myself was before I got accepted into Bueller

438
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:53,340
I

439
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:17,660
I will always die to these things no matter what

440
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:23,100
There was a way to be like spawning that type of monster you would guys would just fuck me the entire time

441
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:27,580
Um how to fate super no, I don't know. I kind of like my

442
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:31,420
My area of attack one when I go back to the other one

443
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:36,300
Tarot like most of these were occult stuff in the west

444
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:40,380
French tarot, uh, I feel like

445
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:47,660
I've never heard of french tarot to be honest with you unless it's just like in french culture to use tarot like the

446
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:49,660
because the writer, writer waits tarot

447
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:55,100
To use that for

448
00:55:57,500 --> 00:56:02,540
Just like every day because some people just like do stuff in their day to day just to um

449
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:08,620
It's like predictions like or just for advice. So I wouldn't be surprised if like the fucking french do that

450
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:14,300
It sounds like a french thing to do

451
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:23,820
Yeah, I know where your fucking relic is nobody just you wait

452
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:26,060
Yeah

453
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:44,300
Tarot is you know, it's linked to it is mostly used for the occult and I think in western cultures. Oh fuck me

454
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:46,780
um

455
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:50,220
Uh, but also in like

456
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:52,540
I feel like a lot of like native cultures

457
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:55,020
Tarot is used as a divination tool

458
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:58,620
Um, I when I would do streaming with tarot

459
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:02,940
I would usually just recommend if you didn't believe in it or you feel comfortable with it

460
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:05,340
You can use it as a reflection or introspection tool

461
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:14,140
That would be the little oh those cards. Yeah, I've not used those cards before

462
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:23,260
Because I'm always like you can do you don't have to believe in what it is. We can just have fun

463
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:26,940
See what it has to say and then 99 percent of the time

464
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:29,580
If not a hundred

465
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:33,100
Um

466
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:36,060
I was oh fuck me

467
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:40,940
Right about whatever they were going through

00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:45,180
All right, oh you're gonna you're gonna be a bitch to fight aren't you?

May do some more go bars. We'll do some more of these

557
01:06:57,660 --> 01:06:59,660
Just so I can stock up

558
01:07:00,620 --> 01:07:02,620
All right

559
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:10,300
It's getting to be nighttime. No, I don't need to talk to you. I'm just positive some seeds. Oh, I don't have any beetroot seeds

560
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:13,260

561
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:20,140
Oh, I didn't get any seeds or that I have to buy of seeds

562
01:07:21,020 --> 01:07:24,860

563
01:07:25,580 --> 01:07:27,580

564
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:30,220
Still don't need to eat food. I'm gonna go

565
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:33,580

566
01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:35,740
Now I see what the goofy of voice

567
01:07:37,980 --> 01:07:42,220
Well, I can replicate her accent is just getting the pitch right

568
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:46,700
In her cadence because she tends to draw out her

569
01:07:48,540 --> 01:07:51,100
Her words like she's constantly thinking

570
01:07:51,820 --> 01:07:56,860
I could see the liver being pretty good muscle tissue. I feel like it suits up

571
01:08:01,180 --> 01:08:05,820
Uh, uh, there's a cat. Okay, hold on me. Bye

577
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:36,540
Sometimes I think about if she'd be an hour in high school

578
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:42,780
She protect me from bullies and let me call me dork and share her biscuits with me and take me to prom and make me practice kissing

579
01:08:48,140 --> 01:08:50,140

No, they meant actual bread biscuits with jam and stuff because I'm like I like big biscuits. I like Popeyes biscuits

585
01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:46,220
Outing my affliction. I've been afflicted with British

775
01:30:45,660 --> 01:30:50,220
In front of my apartment and there is a father outside

776
01:30:52,300 --> 01:30:54,300
Pushing his kids in a stroller

777
01:30:54,940 --> 01:30:59,180
And then he lets them go down the hill and he runs behind and then he runs forward to push it

778
01:30:59,180 --> 01:31:05,020
He's like doing a workout with his kids in the stroller and I was his all I saw was a stroller going backwards towards the road

779
01:31:06,940 --> 01:31:09,020
It's not a busy road, but I was like what the fuck

780
01:31:11,020 --> 01:31:13,020

Um, I would rather have the death sweep

Uh, I could get the dagger. I'd actually think I would prefer the dagger

809
01:33:58,060 --> 01:34:00,060

874
01:41:48,780 --> 01:41:50,780

876
01:41:57,180 --> 01:41:59,180
Can't be negative faith

877
01:42:05,100 --> 01:42:07,100
Cannibalism rocks

878
01:42:14,620 --> 01:42:17,100
Oh, let me do that. Uh, let's see. Let's see

879
01:42:18,780 --> 01:42:20,460

Okay, so I can get five or again. Oh, yeah, I'll do that that actually

887
01:42:47,740 --> 01:42:53,260
It's very efficient like when you're out of food it's important that you can eat some people

01:43:01,420 --> 01:43:07,900
We're doing so good look at all these faithful people hold on actually come back here

889

898
01:44:11,980 --> 01:44:13,980

901
01:44:32,300 --> 01:44:34,300
All right. All right. All right. Oh

902
01:44:36,460 --> 01:44:38,460

Okay, um

908
01:45:19,980 --> 01:45:24,140
People will probably be fucking faithless tomorrow and leave and steal my money

909
01:45:25,580 --> 01:45:27,580
I didn't mean to do that

910
01:45:27,740 --> 01:45:34,140
I literally just need lumber that's all I need in this world

911
01:45:38,380 --> 01:45:42,300
I really don't feel like going to dark wood. I don't know if that should just let the tree grow

912
01:45:45,580 --> 01:45:47,980
Uh, yeah, there's really nothing I can do to

913
01:45:48,620 --> 01:45:53,340
Zero what do you gotta say?

914
01:45:58,780 --> 01:46:06,060
Damn you try to suck your own titties sometimes when you're really thirsty you just you just live off of that. That's impressive

915
01:46:10,140 --> 01:46:12,140
And I level you up

916
01:46:18,940 --> 01:46:20,940

917
01:46:26,540 --> 01:46:30,380

945
01:50:18,460 --> 01:50:20,460
So I don't really need to worry about a crypt

946
01:50:23,260 --> 01:50:25,260
I think I'm gonna do this

947
01:50:33,260 --> 01:50:35,260

1022
02:00:33,980 --> 02:00:38,460
All right, let's get some cards. Want the bonus resources?

1023
02:00:38,460 --> 02:00:40,460
This one

1024
02:00:49,420 --> 02:00:52,780
Fire projectile image during the day

1025
02:00:54,940 --> 02:00:59,500
Uh, I do have money for all of them. I'll just get all of them

1026
02:01:02,540 --> 02:01:04,540
Actually, let me check the other place first

1027
02:01:09,340 --> 02:01:11,340
I

1028
02:01:17,020 --> 02:01:20,060
Realize they mostly do my runs at night, so I'm not gonna buy the sun one right now

1029
02:01:26,060 --> 02:01:30,140
Okay, then we'll go to this guy

1030
02:01:32,380 --> 02:01:35,900
What are you buying what are you selling?

1031
02:01:35,900 --> 02:01:37,900
Um

1032
02:01:38,140 --> 02:01:40,140
What was the one over here?

1033
02:01:41,260 --> 02:01:43,260
Soul snatcher

1034
02:01:43,660 --> 02:01:45,660
That one

1035
02:02:02,140 --> 02:02:05,100
See how he's doing for that

1036
02:02:05,340 --> 02:02:07,340
I

1037
02:02:12,780 --> 02:02:17,420
Cards spawn a tentacle

1038
02:02:25,420 --> 02:02:27,420
Night one

1039
02:02:28,140 --> 02:02:30,140
Oh

1040
02:02:32,620 --> 02:02:41,580
20 I got left I got 47 uh rolling into an enemy you'll damage them damages

1041
02:02:43,820 --> 02:02:45,820
I'll do that

1042
02:02:45,820 --> 02:02:47,820
Oh

1043
02:02:54,140 --> 02:02:59,260
Coolio all right, excuse me mushroom dude

1044
02:03:05,020 --> 02:03:07,020
Hey, it is a good song

1045
02:03:07,900 --> 02:03:09,900
Oh

1046
02:03:14,140 --> 02:03:20,060
I was saying like the what do you buy it because I was watching I've been watching gamecrumbs play through um

1047
02:03:21,100 --> 02:03:23,100
resident evil

1048
02:03:23,820 --> 02:03:28,780
Eight and the duke was like making the reference to resident evil floor going what do you buy it?

1049
02:03:29,820 --> 02:03:31,820
And I was just like

1050
02:03:32,300 --> 02:03:34,300
Okay, uh

1051
02:03:35,820 --> 02:03:40,780
Some of you guys might get sick. It's fine though. Don't worry about it late 5% chance

1052
02:04:01,980 --> 02:04:03,980
Great

1053
02:04:15,740 --> 02:04:17,740
Okay, we're gonna go darkwood

1054
02:04:22,140 --> 02:04:24,140
Sorry I'm more so focusing on

1055
02:04:26,300 --> 02:04:28,540
Building stuff and building resources

1056
02:04:28,780 --> 02:04:35,180
I'll probably play a little bit of this off stream when I say a little I'll probably end up like beating two bosses

1057
02:04:41,660 --> 02:04:43,660
Oh, hey

1058
02:04:47,100 --> 02:04:55,100
Oh, it's uh, Voldemort was kidding around us the world creaks and turns before it stood immobile motionless sentries go frost

1059
02:04:55,340 --> 02:04:57,340
Oh

1060
02:04:57,580 --> 02:05:02,060
Unless she has fallen hair upon the inhabitant of the sand together fight to new to presume power

1061
02:05:02,620 --> 02:05:04,860
You shall not find them so easily dispatched again

1062
02:05:09,820 --> 02:05:11,820
Ah fun

1063
02:05:13,340 --> 02:05:15,340
My least favorite combo

1064
02:05:16,940 --> 02:05:18,940
Or would rock was young what?

1065
02:05:25,340 --> 02:05:27,340
Ah

1066
02:05:37,740 --> 02:05:39,740
Right

1067
02:05:42,780 --> 02:05:44,780
It's time to pop up

1068
02:05:55,100 --> 02:05:57,100
Oh

1069
02:06:25,100 --> 02:06:27,100
Oh

1070
02:06:55,100 --> 02:06:57,100
Oh

1071
02:07:17,820 --> 02:07:23,580
I'll come back a friend. Oh, oh my gosh. Oh, yes. Oh perfect. Hi

1072
02:07:25,100 --> 02:07:26,620

1073
02:07:26,620 --> 02:07:31,900
Hi, shimmy. It's me again fun time Freddy and welcome to the cult of the lamb. Well, I'm here. See what happens next

1074
02:07:32,140 --> 02:07:34,140
Let's find out and see

1075
02:07:36,220 --> 02:07:38,220
I love it

1076
02:07:38,300 --> 02:07:40,300
I love it so much

1077
02:07:41,180 --> 02:07:43,180
I'm gonna make a pb and j real quick

1078
02:07:45,580 --> 02:07:47,580
You guys can hear me talk

1079
02:07:49,180 --> 02:07:51,180
Hello

1080
02:07:56,060 --> 02:07:58,060
How does it get crowded like

1081
02:07:59,100 --> 02:08:01,100
I don't even think that's your thing

1082
02:08:04,220 --> 02:08:06,220
There's paint on bottom here

1083
02:08:06,940 --> 02:08:08,940
Okay, I hope my brother's a pony

1084
02:08:25,740 --> 02:08:30,380
He are safe

1085
02:08:34,540 --> 02:08:36,540
I toast the bread

1086
02:08:37,820 --> 02:08:40,220
Usually I toast my breath around pb and j's

1087
02:08:41,580 --> 02:08:43,580
then

1088
02:08:44,060 --> 02:08:46,060
We're super human in old school

1089
02:08:48,140 --> 02:08:50,140
That one does

1090
02:08:51,260 --> 02:08:53,260
Right

1091
02:08:53,980 --> 02:08:55,980
I'm being surrounded by cats

1092
02:09:10,700 --> 02:09:15,020
I'm thinking I beat a cat heck it

1093
02:09:17,020 --> 02:09:19,020
Um

1094
02:09:23,340 --> 02:09:25,340
I'm getting a wave at 8 3

1095
02:09:29,820 --> 02:09:31,820
Moving into peanut butter and can't eat it

1096
02:09:38,700 --> 02:09:40,700
Catch crab with light

1097
02:09:40,940 --> 02:09:42,940
What's that? Oh no

1098
02:09:53,260 --> 02:09:57,980
No, it's not good pb and j though or is the sandwich in general unless you cut it diagonally

1099
02:10:00,780 --> 02:10:02,780
It's a diagonal

1100
02:10:06,460 --> 02:10:08,460
I don't even know if you guys can hear me

1101
02:10:23,500 --> 02:10:25,500
I

1102
02:10:28,540 --> 02:10:31,020
Prefer raspberry preserves

1103
02:10:33,580 --> 02:10:35,580
Bounds of tartness and speed

1104
02:10:37,820 --> 02:10:42,140
But if there's no raspberry preserves, I will just get strawberry jam

1105
02:10:42,220 --> 02:10:45,820
I really don't like grape jump or create flavor thing

1106
02:10:45,820 --> 02:10:47,820
I

1107
02:10:51,180 --> 02:10:55,180
Don't think you like grape kind of like is that honest kids grape juice

1108
02:10:56,860 --> 02:11:00,540
Doesn't taste like okay, I could later for pre-sum

1109
02:11:03,260 --> 02:11:05,260
I'm not a grape soda kind of gal either

1110
02:11:15,820 --> 02:11:18,780
I

1111
02:11:45,980 --> 02:11:47,980
I

1112
02:11:54,780 --> 02:11:56,780
Whoa that emo red riding hood

1113
02:11:59,900 --> 02:12:01,900
Precisely

1114
02:12:09,900 --> 02:12:13,180
It's not a phase chat it's not a phase

1115
02:12:16,780 --> 02:12:18,780
I'm eating pb and j

1116
02:12:35,980 --> 02:12:37,980
Okay, everyone settle down settle down

1117
02:12:38,540 --> 02:12:40,380
I don't want you guys to get crazy and wild

1118
02:12:40,540 --> 02:12:44,860
But please don't spoil the cult the lambs story. I don't want the story to get spoiled. Okay, you got it freddie

1119
02:12:45,260 --> 02:12:47,260
No spoilers here

1120
02:12:53,260 --> 02:12:59,420
Um, it's a phase connect. Um, it is whole green bread

1121
02:13:07,820 --> 02:13:09,820
It's a lifestyle

1122
02:13:11,740 --> 02:13:14,060
There's a story to the game totally

1123
02:13:15,180 --> 02:13:21,980
It's the the gods and the cult. Yep

1124
02:13:29,180 --> 02:13:32,300
Yeah, it's like the like 10 seed whole grain

1125
02:13:45,820 --> 02:13:47,820
How you guys doing

02:13:50,860 --> 02:13:53,820
Hanging in there while you're starving and stuff

1127
02:13:59,660 --> 02:14:01,660
Yeah, tag your spoilers guys

1128
02:14:01,820 --> 02:14:03,820
I

1129
02:14:14,700 --> 02:14:17,200
Hang it on cool. I'm doing good

1130
02:14:17,200 --> 02:14:19,200
I

1131
02:14:29,680 --> 02:14:33,680
Be honest with you, I haven't been really that productive lately besides like streaming related stuff

1132
02:14:34,800 --> 02:14:36,560
So i'm like i'm trying to

1133
02:14:36,560 --> 02:14:43,200
Think tomorrow i'm on my goal to be like to do like three productive things, you know, it's my head flies away

1134
02:14:43,200 --> 02:14:45,200
I

1135
02:14:46,640 --> 02:14:48,320
So i'm like, okay

1136
02:14:48,320 --> 02:14:52,080
Mostly as i'm like, maybe I just do just clean. I like cleaning. Cleaning's relaxing

1137
02:14:53,520 --> 02:14:56,880
So I really just gotta do the dishes. That's all i'm only gonna do

1138
02:14:57,520 --> 02:15:01,520
Um, i'm like, uh, you know, i've been putting it off going food shopping, but I need to do it

1139
02:15:02,960 --> 02:15:08,240
Need to go food shopping. I can't keep door dashing forever. So that would be the dream

1140
02:15:09,200 --> 02:15:11,200
I

1141
02:15:11,520 --> 02:15:14,400
Need a bar in july before bed naughty or

1142
02:15:16,320 --> 02:15:18,320
What

1143
02:15:18,560 --> 02:15:20,560
mods

1144
02:15:20,560 --> 02:15:22,560
mods

1145
02:15:22,560 --> 02:15:24,560
Slap his ass

1146
02:15:24,800 --> 02:15:26,800
And tell him i'm his daddy

1147
02:15:27,280 --> 02:15:28,640
Thank you

1148
02:15:28,640 --> 02:15:32,080
Instacart not like I need to leave my house like I definitely need to leave

1149
02:15:33,680 --> 02:15:35,680
My house

1150
02:15:36,240 --> 02:15:40,560
I haven't oh, I need to text my parents. I haven't talked to my parents in a long time. Well, not a long time

1151
02:15:40,560 --> 02:15:43,440
I need to text my parents as an update from yesterday

1152
02:15:44,480 --> 02:15:46,480
So i haven't texted them and talked to them since yesterday

1153
02:15:52,080 --> 02:15:54,480
Remember I get plenty of food to imagine maybe i'll go and i'll

1154
02:15:55,440 --> 02:15:59,120
I didn't I didn't go and see my dad. So like maybe I should go and see my dad

1155
02:16:00,960 --> 02:16:02,960
Although he's out of the hospital, but no

1156
02:16:03,920 --> 02:16:07,120
Because usually the last time it's happened he was there for like two days

1157
02:16:09,520 --> 02:16:12,320
But they usually kind of got down to a science what they got to do for him

1158
02:16:14,960 --> 02:16:16,960
Stand up and be your own mom

1159
02:16:17,680 --> 02:16:19,680
Now my mods mods are locked in they there

1160
02:16:20,960 --> 02:16:22,960
To live far not too far

1161
02:16:23,360 --> 02:16:25,360
Not too far

1162
02:16:25,760 --> 02:16:27,760
But uh, yeah

1163
02:16:28,560 --> 02:16:30,960
Yeah, just just a weird thing that happens to him sometimes

1164
02:16:30,960 --> 02:16:32,960
But um

1165
02:16:36,320 --> 02:16:41,120
Who's it called what tactic are you something cardio

1166
02:16:43,680 --> 02:16:46,320
Inflation around the heart i'm like blinking because i'm tired

1167
02:16:55,680 --> 02:16:57,680
Around the heart sack

1168
02:17:01,920 --> 02:17:08,720
Our carditis thank you. I'm like they're a cardium. I'm like that's the lining but what's the what's the thing

1169
02:17:11,520 --> 02:17:15,760
Mom's take his reactions. No, he's good. He's good

1170
02:17:18,080 --> 02:17:20,960
Although like I said, I haven't heard from them since yesterday, but

1171
02:17:22,080 --> 02:17:27,920
Again, usually only takes like a day or two for him to leave. So I'm just assuming that to be honest with you

1172
02:17:28,880 --> 02:17:31,040
I could be a really shitty daughter sometimes

1173
02:17:32,960 --> 02:17:34,960
And they'll stay up

1174
02:17:35,440 --> 02:17:37,440
They call my grandparents

1175
02:17:38,320 --> 02:17:40,320
Like yeah, how are you? I'm like, uh

1176
02:17:41,120 --> 02:17:43,120
I'm all right

1177
02:17:43,120 --> 02:17:45,760
I'm just like I just don't like talking to people

1178
02:17:48,080 --> 02:17:50,080
If we don't we're gonna cover this over. Yeah

1179
02:17:50,640 --> 02:17:55,760
It's like I just I tend to overreact for stuff because I'm a very emotional person

1180
02:17:56,560 --> 02:17:59,600
And that's why my mom tries to like tell me stuff and like let's me down easy

1181
02:18:00,080 --> 02:18:02,080
Whatever the the thing is

1182
02:18:02,160 --> 02:18:05,600
Um, she's just like I don't want you to panic because I'm like

1183
02:18:07,120 --> 02:18:11,440
I just tend I'm just like very worried very attached to my mom and my dad

1184
02:18:13,600 --> 02:18:17,120
Being the only child and shit, but actually let me text

1185
02:18:25,760 --> 02:18:27,760
So

1186
02:18:45,600 --> 02:18:50,860
You know, it's really funny know how I told you guys that my

1187
02:18:56,240 --> 02:18:58,240
Extra cat because you're supposed to only have two

1188
02:18:58,880 --> 02:19:03,360
I said like the whole cat setting thing and they haven't even responded to me. I'm like

1189
02:19:04,400 --> 02:19:11,360
So you threaten me and then you wait like a couple days to like tell me if I need to make any adjustments to my friend or anything

1190
02:19:11,520 --> 02:19:13,520
Like what the fuck

1191
02:19:13,760 --> 02:19:15,760
Come on

1192
02:19:15,760 --> 02:19:17,760

1195
02:19:34,320 --> 02:19:38,400

1197
02:19:52,080 --> 02:19:59,120

1198
02:20:02,880 --> 02:20:09,360

1199
02:20:10,880 --> 02:20:12,880
type where

02:20:13,280 --> 02:20:15,280

No, it's not borderline personality disorder

1203
02:20:37,520 --> 02:20:39,520
Okay, I give up

1204
02:20:40,640 --> 02:20:44,000
Starts with an age. It's not hysterical. It's like his something

Hystronics hystronics. Yes. What is the

1211
02:22:19,920 --> 02:22:22,400
Exaggerate oh wait, no, let's to attract attention

1212
02:22:26,480 --> 02:22:28,480
Right, am I done?

1213
02:22:29,760 --> 02:22:32,000
I don't do it for attention. I'm just an overreactor

1214
02:22:35,200 --> 02:22:37,200
Hyperbolic

1215
02:22:42,080 --> 02:22:44,080
I

1216
02:22:57,520 --> 02:23:00,720
He's good. He's good. We're doing okay

1218
02:23:07,680 --> 02:23:09,680

Really awesome support. I think my parents would be like

1220
02:23:16,880 --> 02:23:18,880
Cool, okay, let me put my headphones back on

1221
02:23:20,080 --> 02:23:22,080
King cats

1222
02:23:23,280 --> 02:23:25,280
I'm just so happy to be here that I

1223
02:23:25,920 --> 02:23:29,200
Like I have a tendency to like isolate and shit

1224
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
Sometimes I just need to talk to my parents

1225
02:23:32,480 --> 02:23:34,480
Sometimes I need to talk to you guys

1226
02:23:34,880 --> 02:23:43,520

Real fascinating

1228
02:23:49,840 --> 02:23:53,440
As my chat froze let me fix that

1229
02:23:54,960 --> 02:23:56,640
There we go

1230
02:23:56,640 --> 02:24:01,120
Yeah, to them like a chapter. Uh, my mom yaps more than I do

1231
02:24:01,520 --> 02:24:07,360
But only if she really likes you otherwise she doesn't she won't talk at all

1232
02:24:07,840 --> 02:24:09,840
Like she'll just like listen and just like

1233
02:24:10,480 --> 02:24:12,480
She'd be like, can I trust this motherfucker?

1234
02:24:13,360 --> 02:24:18,160
Are you a real motherfucker? Can I trust you and then she'll like listen to you talk watch your behavior then she'll decide

1235
02:24:20,160 --> 02:24:22,080
Me I just talk talk talk talk talk talk and me and my dad

1236
02:24:22,160 --> 02:24:23,760

Please like us. We're gonna. Yeah, we're gonna try to do everything in our power to gap enough for you to like us

1238
02:24:27,920 --> 02:24:30,480
My mom's just like I don't fucking know but then when you get her going

1239
02:24:32,080 --> 02:24:34,080
Especially about birds

1240
02:24:34,880 --> 02:24:37,440
Or or gardening. She's there

1241
02:24:38,400 --> 02:24:40,400
She's having a great time

1242
02:24:41,040 --> 02:24:44,240
In cult of the lamb you must defeat all the bosses on your path and what you're there

1243
02:24:44,560 --> 02:24:46,560
You might confront the one who weighs what?

1244
02:24:47,440 --> 02:24:49,440
Freddy no spoilers

1245
02:24:52,160 --> 02:24:54,160
Freddy

1246
02:24:57,280 --> 02:24:59,280
Goodness gracious ready

1247
02:25:01,120 --> 02:25:03,120
My tracking is not that good because I'm in the dark

1248
02:25:07,920 --> 02:25:13,600
You know what is a show? Oh, I'm sorry. No a movie. I haven't seen her favorite flower. Um

1249
02:25:19,760 --> 02:25:21,760
Dahlia to Dahlia

1250
02:25:22,240 --> 02:25:24,000
Then she likes peonies

1251
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:28,000
Although it was really funny because when she first started gardening she's called them peonies and I'm like mom

1252
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:31,360
It's called a peony. She's like a peony. I'm like peony

1253
02:25:32,160 --> 02:25:34,560
She likes yeah, she likes Dahlia's and uh peonies

1254
02:25:37,040 --> 02:25:38,960
And then

1255
02:25:38,960 --> 02:25:40,960
My what's my dad's favorite flower?

1256
02:25:43,200 --> 02:25:45,200
It's not foxglove

1257
02:25:46,320 --> 02:25:48,320
I think my dad's just like

1258
02:25:49,280 --> 02:25:55,520
I'd probably say like the shrubs that we we helped pull out. He'd be like, yeah, I did that one. That's that's the one I like

1259
02:25:56,400 --> 02:25:59,280
No, it's not pronounced peony

1260
02:26:01,760 --> 02:26:04,160
It was really cool though. I got to help her plant Dahlia's

1261
02:26:05,040 --> 02:26:06,000
um

1262
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:09,440
She's been working on like like a vegetable garden and just like

1263
02:26:10,400 --> 02:26:13,280
You know, like when you hear someone just be like super passionate

1264
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
We'll something they oh

1265
02:26:16,240 --> 02:26:20,480
I thought mercy died. I was really nervous. Um, super passionate about something

1266
02:26:21,120 --> 02:26:22,320
I

1267
02:26:22,320 --> 02:26:24,320
Love this like listening to my mom

1268
02:26:24,640 --> 02:26:28,560
Yeah, and her eyes light up when she talks about like making her vegetable garden

1269
02:26:29,200 --> 02:26:32,000
And like all the stuff she's gonna cook with it and it just makes me so happy

1270
02:26:33,120 --> 02:26:38,800
She is doing something that she loves and like that's like what v-tubing is for me, but I kind of wish I also had

1271
02:26:40,640 --> 02:26:42,640
What the hell

1272
02:26:45,600 --> 02:26:47,600
Um

1273
02:26:47,600 --> 02:26:49,600
But I wish I had

1274
02:26:50,320 --> 02:26:52,320
Like another hobby

1275
02:26:53,040 --> 02:26:55,040
Like maybe like an outdoors one

1276
02:26:55,280 --> 02:27:00,960
Or like a more active one because like it was really cool doing jujitsu, but after

1277
02:27:02,800 --> 02:27:07,360
I got like could like having fibro and stuff and they're on fire this in my neck. Although I'm like

1278
02:27:08,320 --> 02:27:11,360
fucking young at age 56. Um

1279
02:27:14,320 --> 02:27:16,880
I just I couldn't do it anymore because it was just painful

1280
02:27:17,680 --> 02:27:19,680
It was such a good full body workout

1281
02:27:22,880 --> 02:27:26,000
And it's usually what happens to people like I got injured and I can't train

1282
02:27:28,960 --> 02:27:32,640
It was cool though, I went to my old school and I watched people get um promoted to belts

1283
02:27:34,720 --> 02:27:36,720
I'm like wow, they'll never be me

1284
02:27:37,760 --> 02:27:40,240
It is like I hadn't been so passionate about something

1285
02:27:41,280 --> 02:27:43,280
So sucks when the source things happens

1286
02:27:44,080 --> 02:27:46,080
Uh, I was Brazilian jujitsu

1287
02:27:47,120 --> 02:27:49,120
I

1288
02:27:51,920 --> 02:27:58,880
There's this one dude, um, you remember how I told you that I accidentally put one of my um

1289
02:28:00,320 --> 02:28:03,760
Like spar sparring partners to sleep so

1290
02:28:06,240 --> 02:28:09,920
Mind you he didn't tap like if it was if he tapped

1291
02:28:11,600 --> 02:28:13,600
Then

1292
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,160
I wouldn't have I would have let up, you know

1293
02:28:16,880 --> 02:28:20,640
He never tapped he just like went to sleep and it's not like he didn't couldn't tap

1294
02:28:22,720 --> 02:28:24,720
He could have easily tapped

1295
02:28:27,920 --> 02:28:30,800
But um, so his friend

1296
02:28:35,200 --> 02:28:37,200
His friend, um

1297
02:28:39,760 --> 02:28:41,760
Bumi what are you saying?

1298
02:28:43,200 --> 02:28:45,200
Put me in a

1299
02:28:45,520 --> 02:28:47,520
Uh

1300
02:28:48,720 --> 02:28:52,560
To lock and just fucking cranked my ankle

1301
02:28:54,640 --> 02:28:59,280
And he was like and then I had to tap during our our spar and it fucking hurt so bad

1302
02:28:59,360 --> 02:29:01,360
My ankle was swollen

1303
02:29:01,440 --> 02:29:03,440
He's like that was putting putting that kid to sleep

1304
02:29:04,080 --> 02:29:08,640
And I'm like you're a fucking piece of shit. You're lucky that you're better than me or I put you in the ground

1305
02:29:09,600 --> 02:29:11,600
Um because he was a blue belt

1306
02:29:12,080 --> 02:29:15,520
And I also fucking hated him because every time I rolled with him you just smelled like fucking cum

1307
02:29:16,400 --> 02:29:19,520
I'm like who sweats and they smell like this. It's like so gross

1308
02:29:22,560 --> 02:29:28,960
And at that time I was the only girl in my class because the the girls they used to I used to train with stopped going and I was like, come on

1309
02:29:37,120 --> 02:29:40,960
Like I can put you I can probably put like an unexperienced person in a holds

1310
02:29:41,840 --> 02:29:43,040
um

1311
02:29:43,040 --> 02:29:45,040
like I remember um

1312
02:29:45,280 --> 02:29:47,840
Salem one of my best friends, um, she

1313
02:29:49,040 --> 02:29:54,560
I was like showing her some moves and so I put her in a rear naked chokehold in the middle of our store

1314
02:29:55,280 --> 02:29:58,400
In a retail store that we worked at and she just let out the like the most like

1315
02:29:59,840 --> 02:30:02,720
The most cute and funny scream because she's a high-pitched voice. She was like

1316
02:30:03,360 --> 02:30:05,360
Like she sounded like fucking r2d2

1317
02:30:06,480 --> 02:30:08,480
It was so funny

1318
02:30:09,520 --> 02:30:11,520
And um

1319
02:30:12,560 --> 02:30:14,560
Come here squirrel

1320
02:30:16,640 --> 02:30:21,760
So like for her it was it was easy. Oh sweet. I think it would um, let's see

1321
02:30:23,360 --> 02:30:25,120
I don't know

1322
02:30:25,120 --> 02:30:27,120
This way because I think we have what a second time

1323
02:30:29,040 --> 02:30:31,440
This is french perfume, but like I had never

1324
02:30:33,040 --> 02:30:36,160
Experienced that because like being in gym class with people from school

1325
02:30:37,120 --> 02:30:39,120
um

1326
02:30:39,120 --> 02:30:44,640
Like or the other guys that I would roll with I'm just like why the fuck do you smell like

1327
02:30:45,840 --> 02:30:47,840
Nutt

1328
02:30:48,960 --> 02:30:50,960
Like that's so fucking gross

1329
02:30:59,360 --> 02:31:01,360
Like

1330
02:31:01,680 --> 02:31:03,840
Like like you know how like people have like pheromones

1331
02:31:05,440 --> 02:31:08,560
And stuff and like sometimes when you sweat you smell good

1332
02:31:10,080 --> 02:31:12,080
Like

1333
02:31:12,400 --> 02:31:14,560
I've had people certain people tell me like I um

1334
02:31:15,840 --> 02:31:18,880
When I sweat I smell good. I remember like reading that right now. What are you doing?

1335
02:31:18,880 --> 02:31:24,160
She's like on my lap that if you like have something that's like someone's like sweating and they smell good to you

1336
02:31:24,880 --> 02:31:26,880
you're like

1337
02:31:26,960 --> 02:31:31,120
You know, you're like genetically pre-disposed to want to like be with them or something

1338
02:31:33,600 --> 02:31:35,600
Uh, it was a mix of gi and no gi

1339
02:31:36,560 --> 02:31:41,280
Um, we were doing that when I was rolling with them, then we were we were doing um

1340
02:31:42,560 --> 02:31:44,080
I don't know if it was up

1341
02:31:44,080 --> 02:31:47,600
We were doing a gi and we were trying a collar

1342
02:31:50,880 --> 02:31:52,880
Collar submissions

1343
02:31:53,200 --> 02:31:55,200
My favorite was

1344
02:31:56,240 --> 02:31:58,240
Doing a bow and arrow choke

1345
02:32:00,080 --> 02:32:02,080
You start the last time

1346
02:32:02,240 --> 02:32:04,240
I got the money for it. We're not

1347
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
You

1348
02:32:09,680 --> 02:32:14,960
Don't think you feel like dislikes anyone sweat smell. Well, that means that you know, I guess you're genetically pre-disposed like those people

1349
02:32:19,440 --> 02:32:25,120
Someone if you means like I think it's like I remember reading that like if someone smells good to you that

1350
02:32:26,560 --> 02:32:30,240
You would have you would have it's because they're like genetically

1351
02:32:31,840 --> 02:32:33,040
healthy

1352
02:32:33,040 --> 02:32:35,040
To your mind and you want to

1353
02:32:35,920 --> 02:32:37,920
appropriate with them

1354
02:32:38,480 --> 02:32:42,160
Some creates strong babies very like

1355
02:32:43,440 --> 02:32:45,440
Basic instincts come here bird

1356
02:32:48,960 --> 02:32:53,920
Yeah, something to do the microbiome immune system. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Like it's like, oh, I if you smell bad

1357
02:32:53,920 --> 02:32:56,480
You like must be sickly or like you're just disgusting

1358
02:32:57,360 --> 02:33:02,720
Forgive me. She forgive me. She be chat. I accidentally spoiled the story. That was very not cool

1359
02:33:03,760 --> 02:33:08,400
I said too much. I'm sorry. Don't want to spoil it again. No more spoilers. No, it's all right, freddy

1360
02:33:08,960 --> 02:33:12,480
We forgive you freddy. Don't worry about it. I'm as happy you're here freddy

1361
02:33:19,040 --> 02:33:25,760
Oh, it explains a lot my teacher demonstrated it bow and bow and arrow on me and this is so it's so fun to do

1362
02:33:25,840 --> 02:33:28,400
I just drive my fucking knees into the person's back

1363
02:33:28,400 --> 02:33:33,920
To create a large brood

1364
02:33:35,920 --> 02:33:37,920
Yes, a large brood

1365
02:33:41,040 --> 02:33:47,680
Oh, it's not really I need like one more flower thing

1366
02:33:47,680 --> 02:33:49,680
I

1367
02:33:56,880 --> 02:33:59,520
Am I here rain and plowing because she's right next to the mic. Oh, hello

1368
02:34:01,760 --> 02:34:03,760
Will

1369
02:34:04,400 --> 02:34:07,680
So I started blasting. I think I'm fine. I think I'm good

1370
02:34:13,200 --> 02:34:15,200
Oh

1371
02:34:18,560 --> 02:34:20,560
Yeah

1372
02:34:33,440 --> 02:34:38,640
Yeah, I think for me smell is like a

1373
02:34:39,920 --> 02:34:43,920
Very big thing to me because of big your breath smells. I don't want you anywhere near me

1374
02:34:44,240 --> 02:34:47,920
You got the helitosis stay the walk away from me bud

1375
02:34:50,240 --> 02:34:55,120
Like I remember having customers and like such like I had one guy that I could smell his breath

1376
02:34:56,240 --> 02:34:57,600
from like

1377
02:34:57,600 --> 02:34:59,600
Five feet away. It was bad out

1378
02:35:14,720 --> 02:35:16,720
I think didn't go off

1379
02:35:23,760 --> 02:35:27,200
Like helped you get into dumb of nature it really did though because like

1380
02:35:29,280 --> 02:35:31,280
It was a really good like if

1381
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,880
I always recommend if you like have anger issues or something

1382
02:35:35,680 --> 02:35:40,160
Going to the gym or like doing a contact sport

1383
02:35:40,400 --> 02:35:42,400
Is so

1384
02:35:43,360 --> 02:35:45,360
satisfying

1385
02:35:45,520 --> 02:35:47,520
because I would like

1386
02:35:47,840 --> 02:35:49,840
I would just be like so

1387
02:35:49,920 --> 02:35:52,720
angry and pent up and like fucking depressed and then

1388
02:35:53,840 --> 02:35:58,480
I would just go and beat up dudes like it was so great. It was so awesome

1389
02:35:58,480 --> 02:36:00,480
I

1390
02:36:07,520 --> 02:36:11,040
Was just super satisfied and it also was just like super

1391
02:36:11,840 --> 02:36:16,800
Empowering in a way because like I knew I like if course came just

1392
02:36:17,840 --> 02:36:21,840
Fucking rain. I just stepped on my nipple. Holy shit. Oh my god claw just

1393
02:36:23,280 --> 02:36:25,280
Essentially just pierced my nipple

1394
02:36:29,440 --> 02:36:31,440
Oh

1395
02:36:54,640 --> 02:36:56,640
Oh, not you guys

1396
02:36:56,960 --> 02:36:58,960
Oh, not you guys

1397
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,000
Especially mixed with the fucking bats

1398
02:37:26,960 --> 02:37:28,960
What's why did you have to spawn more?

1399
02:37:41,520 --> 02:37:44,400
Uh, I was not paying attention. Oh, fuck me

1400
02:37:48,640 --> 02:37:53,760
Thanks guys accidents do happen a lot. I'm just gonna let the story narrate itself. See you guys later. Bye freddy

1401
02:37:54,560 --> 02:37:56,560
Stay fun time

1402
02:38:02,080 --> 02:38:04,800
Yeah, it's just like you're just like a good type of tired

1403
02:38:06,320 --> 02:38:08,000
after

1404
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:10,000
Um doing jiu-jitsu

1405
02:38:10,400 --> 02:38:14,240
Because one I like I like jiu-jitsu because it was I was almost like fucking

1406
02:38:15,040 --> 02:38:18,480
Being in the military because he got into practice like discipline and respect

1407
02:38:19,280 --> 02:38:21,280
Um with restraint

1408
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:28,800
Oh, let's see how they are doing. I kind of want to get a grand shelter

1409
02:38:35,360 --> 02:38:45,200
I'm gonna get this fucking propaganda speakers. I'm gonna get a grand shelter. Oh, wait, no, I want to do the one that

1410
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:54,000
I

1411
02:38:56,960 --> 02:39:01,520
Although like I remember like my dad was trying to teach me how to deadlifts because my dad deadlifts um

1412
02:39:02,960 --> 02:39:09,120
And that was pretty cool, too. Like it was super satisfying. I only did it like once though because it wasn't

1413
02:39:10,880 --> 02:39:13,200
As satisfying as like laying a sport was

1414
02:39:21,680 --> 02:39:32,480
Yeah, you are best get real close and comfortable

1415
02:39:35,840 --> 02:39:40,080
Also, I don't know if it's the same in the u.s. But my gym was such an inclusive sport

1416
02:39:41,040 --> 02:39:43,920
Yeah, like 100 it really was because I

1417
02:39:45,600 --> 02:39:50,560
It because I could tell like some of the guys would hold back when they um sparred with me

1418
02:39:51,600 --> 02:39:56,800
I'm gonna buy you now. Yes, fucking. Thank you. Oh my god. Thank you so much go to sleep

1419
02:39:58,480 --> 02:40:00,480
Go to sleep

1420
02:40:01,360 --> 02:40:03,360
Um

1421
02:40:04,320 --> 02:40:06,320
I

1422
02:40:19,760 --> 02:40:23,120
Um, but yeah, oh as I was saying, um, oh my god, I'm gonna talk that up

1423
02:40:24,640 --> 02:40:28,880
I would say like how am I gonna learn if you you know

1424
02:40:29,040 --> 02:40:35,040
Don't give the same like how am I? Oh my god. How am I gonna defend might be able to like

1425
02:40:36,400 --> 02:40:38,400
Grow as a

1426
02:40:38,560 --> 02:40:40,560
um

1427
02:40:40,720 --> 02:40:42,720
As a participant if you don't

1428
02:40:44,320 --> 02:40:46,160
Help me out a little bit

1429
02:40:46,160 --> 02:40:52,240
And so then they were like, you know what? Okay. And then I would learn like what my limits are and how to hold my own

1430
02:40:53,760 --> 02:40:55,600
and it was

1431
02:40:55,680 --> 02:41:00,480
It was like it just leveled the playing field. The only thing that was annoying is that my tits got in the way a lot

1432
02:41:02,880 --> 02:41:05,520
I remember I had a guy like accidentally like go for

1433
02:41:06,560 --> 02:41:08,560
a

1434
02:41:08,880 --> 02:41:11,360
For some grips and he like grabbed me in the boob

1435
02:41:12,560 --> 02:41:19,120
And he was like, oh fuck. Sorry. And I'm like, huh get rekt and then I like I like did an inversion and then I just fucked him up

1436
02:41:20,080 --> 02:41:22,080
I'm like, I don't give a shit. This isn't

1437
02:41:22,640 --> 02:41:24,640
like

1438
02:41:25,680 --> 02:41:29,760
It's not like it's a different situation. Like we're sparring. We're just we're just doing whatever

1439
02:41:33,520 --> 02:41:35,520
Put his ass inside control real quick

1440
02:41:37,600 --> 02:41:42,560
Have person to be like come at me um growing up in school. Nobody wanted to fight me

1441
02:41:43,520 --> 02:41:45,520
Because I was one taller than everybody

1442
02:41:45,840 --> 02:41:47,840
um

1443
02:41:48,800 --> 02:41:53,280
And I it was weird like I have this weird thing where if someone

1444
02:41:53,520 --> 02:41:59,200
Like comes at me and starts to like try to argue with me or something. I just laugh at them

1445
02:42:01,200 --> 02:42:03,680
And it's probably like a nervous tick of mine, but

1446
02:42:05,520 --> 02:42:09,760
It it seems like intimidates people is what I've been told

1447
02:42:10,720 --> 02:42:15,120
Because I remember this girl came up to me. She's like, um at work and she's like

1448
02:42:15,680 --> 02:42:22,080
One I am not like a gossipy person. I'm not. Um, I don't have the energy. I'm too fucking old for that shit

1449
02:42:22,880 --> 02:42:24,880
It's not high school anymore

1450
02:42:25,280 --> 02:42:28,960
And she's like, have you been talking shit about me? And I literally started

1451
02:42:29,600 --> 02:42:32,800
Hysterically laughing at her. I'm like, who the fuck told you that?

1452
02:42:33,440 --> 02:42:36,000
If I had something to say I'd say to your fucking face

1453
02:42:36,800 --> 02:42:42,320
And I was pissed because she's my friend and I'm like, why do you think it was because this one dude who um

1454
02:42:43,120 --> 02:42:47,360
Had a crush on her was like trying to separate her from us from our friend group

1455
02:42:48,800 --> 02:42:50,800
He was a shitty dude

1456
02:42:51,760 --> 02:42:53,760
Um

1457
02:42:54,560 --> 02:42:57,520
And so and then she said afterwards like she's like it kind of freaked me out

1458
02:42:58,560 --> 02:43:00,560
Then I'm like, sorry. Well, like

1459
02:43:02,560 --> 02:43:04,000
You didn't have to

1460
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:09,600
The way you approached it. The way you spoke to me was disrespectful. So I'm gonna disrespect you back, you know

1461
02:43:13,200 --> 02:43:17,200
If you came out to be like, hey somebody told me that you said something negative about me

1462
02:43:17,200 --> 02:43:21,360
Then I'm gonna be like, what? I'm gonna get to the bottom of it. I'm the type of person that like if I hear

1463
02:43:22,960 --> 02:43:24,960
Someone

1464
02:43:25,040 --> 02:43:27,040
saying something negative

1465
02:43:27,280 --> 02:43:31,600
About me or some other. Oh, look at you cleaning in me. Um, me or another person

1466
02:43:31,680 --> 02:43:34,560
I like immediately go to nip it in the butt because I'm like we're adults

1467
02:43:35,760 --> 02:43:39,060
Fuck it out. Like we're not fucking doing this. It's fucking stupid

1468
02:43:39,060 --> 02:43:46,260
We'll be reversal. Yeah, it's part of how wrestling isn't gay. Yeah

1469
02:43:53,460 --> 02:43:58,100
Uh, I need gold for that. All right, I'm gonna make another

1470
02:44:00,900 --> 02:44:02,900
Another oh, I don't have money

1471
02:44:02,900 --> 02:44:04,900
I

1472
02:44:06,500 --> 02:44:08,980
What will give me a lot of my gold? Oh, yeah, but

1473
02:44:12,260 --> 02:44:16,500
Should go fishing this fishing would get me stuff

1474
02:44:18,900 --> 02:44:21,060
It's also cotton because I don't need cotton either

1475
02:44:24,180 --> 02:44:26,680
Nope didn't even mean to catch him

1476
02:44:33,860 --> 02:44:35,860
I'm desperate need of that wood

1477
02:44:38,020 --> 02:44:40,020
Game is like for a moment

1478
02:44:40,260 --> 02:44:42,260
Look at me

1479
02:44:44,500 --> 02:44:46,500
Oh hi, what's up?

1480
02:44:49,140 --> 02:44:51,140
Uh, sure

1481
02:44:56,500 --> 02:44:59,380
Yeah, I'll always I'm sorry my cat's food is going off. I

1482
02:45:00,340 --> 02:45:02,340
I'll always stand my ground and

1483
02:45:03,780 --> 02:45:06,500
If I don't agree with something I will speak my mind

1484
02:45:07,540 --> 02:45:13,460
I'm not gonna really bother with these. Oh, they're a cop profiliac like some of you guys

1485
02:45:14,980 --> 02:45:20,180
They gain faith when they fall ill while they're about to fall ill. So I'm supposed to be sickly apparently

1486
02:45:23,940 --> 02:45:26,340
Then I can literally just

1487
02:45:29,540 --> 02:45:31,540
Tell them

1488
02:45:33,620 --> 02:45:35,620
Pass out on the ground that's so funny

1489
02:45:42,180 --> 02:45:44,180
Yeah, I think like I was

1490
02:45:46,580 --> 02:45:50,660
When I was younger I was very much a push over

1491
02:45:51,700 --> 02:45:55,700
And I my mom always said that I was a follower and I wasn't a leader

1492
02:45:57,300 --> 02:45:59,300
um

1493
02:45:59,380 --> 02:46:04,100
Because I would have really bad friends that would like

1494
02:46:05,300 --> 02:46:10,260
Take my money and I'd be like, yeah, it's fine or just like I just wouldn't be able to stand it for myself and then

1495
02:46:12,260 --> 02:46:16,500
Growing up. I just eventually learned to do so really like working at um

1496
02:46:17,780 --> 02:46:19,780
The retail store was a

1497
02:46:20,580 --> 02:46:27,140
Very big dose of reality for me because after growing up so sheltered

1498
02:46:28,100 --> 02:46:30,100
Um and like

1499
02:46:32,340 --> 02:46:35,460
Experiencing the real world with people and like

1500
02:46:37,380 --> 02:46:42,980
The drama and all that other shit and I'm like wait a second like I don't even

1501
02:46:44,420 --> 02:46:48,180
I don't have to I don't have to have this reaction. I don't have to act this way

1502
02:46:48,260 --> 02:46:51,380
I don't have to do this. I don't have to do that. I don't have and I did it was like

1503
02:46:51,620 --> 02:46:54,820
Just releasing all that shit and just being like, oh

1504
02:46:55,700 --> 02:46:58,580
Wow, and this like the stress off my shoulders

1505
02:47:00,020 --> 02:47:03,220
It was very nice. Um, I should probably refine some stuff

1506
02:47:13,620 --> 02:47:15,620
Good night. Good night

1507
02:47:16,180 --> 02:47:23,300
I have bushes and machines to see. Yeah, of course. Good night. Yeah, that's nine

1508
02:47:24,900 --> 02:47:28,660
Probably gonna go see if I can kill the cat and I'll probably go to bed myself

1509
02:47:32,980 --> 02:47:39,060
See, can I upgrade? No, I need to wait for that. Oh, you mean the fucking scarecrow

1510
02:47:39,060 --> 02:47:47,780
How am I supposed to how am I supposed to fit these motherfuckers?

1511
02:47:49,540 --> 02:47:51,540
How much space does he take up? He takes up one

1512
02:47:52,420 --> 02:47:54,420
Um

1513
02:47:54,580 --> 02:47:56,580
Then I could

1514
02:47:57,140 --> 02:47:59,140
Actually

1515
02:48:00,740 --> 02:48:03,460
I'm gonna kind of fuck myself but just

1516
02:48:05,380 --> 02:48:07,380
Get rid of that

1517
02:48:09,060 --> 02:48:11,060
Uh

1518
02:48:17,060 --> 02:48:19,300
What we guys are stinking up the place

1519
02:48:24,260 --> 02:48:26,260
Perfect

1520
02:48:32,100 --> 02:48:34,100

1537
02:50:32,340 --> 02:50:34,500
No need to rush. No need to be like

1538
02:50:35,380 --> 02:50:36,420
Oh

02:50:36,420 --> 02:50:41,540
Nobody's talking. I'm content. Just spending time and hanging out with you guys to be honest with you

1540
02:50:44,660 --> 02:50:47,620
Like that's I think that's um

1541
02:50:51,940 --> 02:50:53,940
That's something

1542
02:50:53,940 --> 02:50:55,300
I've

1543
02:50:55,300 --> 02:51:00,020
realized I enjoy a lot about like some friendships that I've had is like being able to

1544
02:51:03,460 --> 02:51:08,740
Um kind of just hang out with someone and not have to say a word

1545
02:51:09,620 --> 02:51:11,780
Like when you just can be comfortable in the silence

1546
02:51:14,180 --> 02:51:16,820
Um in a friendship it's a very

1547
02:51:18,180 --> 02:51:20,180
Little thing, you know

1548
02:51:24,660 --> 02:51:28,260
Oh now we're all right, we're doing pretty well

1549
02:51:30,820 --> 02:51:32,820

Hurry up

1557
02:52:01,460 --> 02:52:03,780
Do I have enough yet because I want to make the uh

1558
02:52:05,860 --> 02:52:08,420
Farmer plot where they collect it so I don't have to worry about it

1559
02:52:10,820 --> 02:52:12,820
Excuse me. Oh perfect

1560
02:52:13,940 --> 02:52:15,940
Uh

1561
02:52:17,220 --> 02:52:19,220
We're just gonna

1562
02:52:24,500 --> 02:52:26,500
We're here

1563
02:52:26,500 --> 02:52:28,500
Yep

1564
02:52:30,100 --> 02:52:31,940
And then we're gonna

1565
02:52:31,940 --> 02:52:33,940
Milt

1566
02:52:36,820 --> 02:52:38,820
Oh

1567
02:52:38,820 --> 02:52:40,900
Fuck uh, I forgot that you have to upgrade

1568
02:52:42,900 --> 02:52:45,540
Okay, let me move that back never mind

1569
02:52:46,500 --> 02:52:50,100
Uh, we're just gonna move it back to where it was

1570
02:52:50,820 --> 02:52:54,660
And then we're gonna upgrade it

1571
02:53:01,860 --> 02:53:06,500
Companionable silence is a very far that's just a pretty way to say it. Companionable silence

1572
02:53:07,060 --> 02:53:09,220
Having a silence with this court call is always fun

1573
02:53:10,740 --> 02:53:12,740
I'm gonna fall asleep in a discord call

1574
02:53:14,100 --> 02:53:17,540
Can't imagine it's like to be two with an audience. I don't want to touch for this stick

1575
02:53:18,500 --> 02:53:23,700
Oh, yeah, yeah, I don't I don't really get that like why do you do what you do if you don't like your audience

1576
02:53:24,340 --> 02:53:27,140
It's always confused me. You're like, oh, I hate my fan base

1577
02:53:27,940 --> 02:53:31,140
And like when people say like chat reflects streamer, it's really true you

1578
02:53:31,940 --> 02:53:32,980
if you

1579
02:53:32,980 --> 02:53:34,980
cultivate

1580
02:53:35,140 --> 02:53:39,940
A certain fan bait like if you cultivate or have this sort of certain personality

1581
02:53:40,900 --> 02:53:43,140
You're gonna why are you guys fighting? Um

1582
02:53:44,020 --> 02:53:46,340
It's gonna reflect on chat and chat's gonna act a certain way

1583
02:53:46,340 --> 02:53:48,340
so it only makes sense to

1584
02:53:48,980 --> 02:53:50,980
you know

1585
02:53:51,540 --> 02:53:53,540
Be the type of person you want to

1586
02:53:55,700 --> 02:53:57,540
track

1587
02:53:57,540 --> 02:53:59,540
your streams

1588
02:54:04,660 --> 02:54:10,180
Or is there a way to like upgrade it so like I don't have to go in collection all the time

1589
02:54:17,300 --> 02:54:20,500
Oh so much

1590
02:54:23,540 --> 02:54:25,540
I need cauliflower seasoning

1591
02:54:25,700 --> 02:54:27,700

02:54:41,140 --> 02:54:46,660
Say where as cool as you I'm not saying none of that don't get it twisted

Don't get it twisted because I'm wearing shabari ropes

1596
02:54:56,420 --> 02:55:01,460
That's why I say it so much because I want it to be my thing. It's every every vtuber has like a phrase

1597
02:55:05,780 --> 02:55:10,180
I want that to be my phrase my soon my soon dere

I'm not doing that now. I'm gonna go kill heck it. What the heck it only got my edge

1606
02:56:00,420 --> 02:56:06,580
Day girl felt on vtubers. Oh, that's my way. That's what people have been calling me. I don't mind it though. I like it

1607
02:56:12,020 --> 02:56:14,020
Hello

02:56:14,020 --> 02:56:16,020

02:56:28,740 --> 02:56:30,740
Okay

1610
02:56:31,620 --> 02:56:33,620
Oh

1611
02:56:35,540 --> 02:56:40,660
That was forgiving of the game. Oh fucking hammer. Let's do it. It's hammer time

1612
02:56:41,300 --> 02:56:49,780
She's perfect. Wait actually sorry, I've been like checking

1613
02:56:57,460 --> 02:56:59,460
Video cannot be long

1614
02:57:02,500 --> 02:57:06,180
What the hell it said this song the stuff was

1615
02:57:07,140 --> 02:57:10,900
It was copyright free. I fucking hate that

1616
02:57:15,620 --> 02:57:17,620
It was just saying my stuff was restricted

1617
02:57:18,740 --> 02:57:20,740
copyrighted

1618
02:57:20,900 --> 02:57:23,300
Hey, thank you for getting me a little box off my

1619
02:57:24,260 --> 02:57:26,260
No, I stuffed up put stuff somewhere

1620
02:57:26,260 --> 02:57:28,260
I

1621
02:57:39,860 --> 02:57:41,860
Yeah, it said it was

1622
02:57:42,420 --> 02:57:49,700
Copyright free royalty free music and it linked to where they got it from that. I was like, I'm like, what the fuck you lied to me

1623
02:57:51,780 --> 02:57:53,780
Doesn't matter

1624
02:57:54,100 --> 02:58:00,260
I'm not really like super hyper focused on monetization. Although I'm it's mostly just like it's a

1625
02:58:01,940 --> 02:58:06,740
As someone who's been a v another vtuber, are you just a content creator on youtube in general?

1626
02:58:06,820 --> 02:58:08,820
I've never been able to get monetized

1627
02:58:09,460 --> 02:58:13,540
Like or just like be able to be part of the partner product like so that's like it's the title

1628
02:58:13,620 --> 02:58:16,740
That's important to me. It's not like the actual like being monetized

1629
02:58:16,900 --> 02:58:20,980
But because I'll be like it's just it's a milestone for me because I've never

1630
02:58:21,940 --> 02:58:23,940
I've gotten that before

1631
02:58:24,740 --> 02:58:26,740
Like the fact that I think

1632
02:58:33,140 --> 02:58:36,580
Like I'm like I'm 10k away from 100k views on my channel

1633
02:58:36,580 --> 02:58:40,980
Like that just like it literally makes me want to cry because I'm just like holy shit

1634
02:58:41,700 --> 02:58:43,700
I never ever thought I would

1635
02:58:44,660 --> 02:58:45,700
get

1636
02:58:45,700 --> 02:58:48,740
That sort of attention in any way shape or form

1637
02:58:51,220 --> 02:58:53,220
Ooh

1638
02:58:53,460 --> 02:58:58,500
So it's just really cool to see the fruits of my labor

1639
02:59:04,740 --> 02:59:10,500
No, yeah, I appreciate it. Yeah, it's like I also just want the fucking emotes like

1640
02:59:12,580 --> 02:59:14,980
Sucks that they don't have anime emotes though

1641
02:59:15,940 --> 02:59:17,300
I'm fast

1642
02:59:17,300 --> 02:59:22,100
Okay, at least with these I can kill them one time. So I'm like, how am I not?

1643
02:59:30,900 --> 02:59:33,140
I'm always sad chopping this fucking tree down

1644
02:59:40,820 --> 02:59:42,820
Am I chopping a tree when it's a

1645
02:59:45,940 --> 02:59:52,020
But it's a fucking hammer music. Have you ever tried to chop a tree down with a hammer?

1646
02:59:55,220 --> 02:59:58,980
But yeah, I I appreciate the support it's been so cool. Um

1647
03:00:00,340 --> 03:00:06,180
While I've been here a week like I've said yesterday, it feels like I've been with hanging out with you guys for longer

1648
03:00:07,140 --> 03:00:09,140
This feels so right

1649
03:00:15,940 --> 03:00:17,940
Oh

1650
03:00:31,460 --> 03:00:39,860
Oh, I need 200 I forgot I needed money for that. Um, oh, I will

1651
03:00:39,860 --> 03:00:41,860
Oh

1652
03:00:43,380 --> 03:00:45,380
Can you go away? I'm trying to

1653
03:00:54,660 --> 03:00:56,660
If I kill it all of them, I will happen

1654
03:01:02,180 --> 03:01:04,180
I'm like super hold on can I say

1655
03:01:09,940 --> 03:01:11,940
It's fine

1656
03:01:16,340 --> 03:01:20,500
Okay, you don't really do anything to me you just you just whine about it

1657
03:01:27,380 --> 03:01:30,660
You look more stream spirit. Oh, thank you. Thank you. I appreciate it

1658
03:01:30,900 --> 03:01:32,900
I

1659
03:01:34,420 --> 03:01:36,420
Had any more emo ideas

1660
03:01:36,580 --> 03:01:38,580
um, you get I don't really

1661
03:01:39,460 --> 03:01:40,660
There's like

1662
03:01:40,660 --> 03:01:42,660
There's one emo. I like

1663
03:01:43,940 --> 03:01:46,500
I know I fucking like me on this channel

1664
03:01:47,140 --> 03:01:52,180
And if you ever followed me, I feel I had a really popular emo that was just like me crying

1665
03:01:53,220 --> 03:01:57,780
And I used to always be like what the fuck is going on and so I want to get a what the fuck is going on

1666
03:02:01,620 --> 03:02:04,180
I also just might get like different stylized emotes

1667
03:02:07,780 --> 03:02:11,860
Uh, let's get this wood two times coins

1668
03:02:13,940 --> 03:02:17,540
I can just go straight. I might just go straight. Yeah, I'm fine. I'm willing right now

1669
03:02:20,100 --> 03:02:25,380
It's finished day eight of 30 days work straight with me. What the hell? Why are you doing that to yourself?

1670
03:02:26,340 --> 03:02:28,340
Oh

1671
03:02:30,020 --> 03:02:33,380
Yeah, I just want to say thank you for real from the bottom of my

1672
03:02:34,980 --> 03:02:36,980
Girlfail dom harp

1673
03:02:38,260 --> 03:02:41,380
That you guys look want to watch me and shit. It's really cool

1674
03:02:43,460 --> 03:02:50,520
Um, thank you for supporting the girls. Oh, perfect more food. I'm so excited

1675
03:02:56,340 --> 03:02:58,340
Ah

1676
03:03:10,500 --> 03:03:12,500
Oh, I think you need a different job

1677
03:03:14,020 --> 03:03:16,020
Um, but

1678
03:03:17,460 --> 03:03:19,460
This feels surreal to be here

1679
03:03:20,900 --> 03:03:24,100
And I just can't wait for what

1680
03:03:25,380 --> 03:03:27,380
Like

1681
03:03:27,380 --> 03:03:29,780
Well, what would be like in like a month?

1682
03:03:33,380 --> 03:03:40,820
I'm actually like really nervous about like collabs with other companies because again, I used to like watch them and now

1683
03:03:42,180 --> 03:03:44,180
I get to just like hang out with them

1684
03:03:45,300 --> 03:03:49,700
Um, and I'm also nervous that like people won't want to hang out with us because

1685
03:03:50,820 --> 03:03:52,820
For content

1686
03:03:53,140 --> 03:03:57,220
But like I'm happy that like we have like the new girls and I have

1687
03:03:58,900 --> 03:04:00,900
some indie friends

1688
03:04:07,940 --> 03:04:13,940
Mercy died of old age. No, okay, we're gonna resurrect mercy. Oh wait. No, fuck. I don't have the resurrect thing

1689
03:04:14,500 --> 03:04:17,540
Um, we went with the funeral. We'll have a nice funeral for mercy

1690
03:04:19,700 --> 03:04:21,220
Unless she gets resurrected

1691
03:04:21,220 --> 03:04:23,620
Uh, I kind of like what I have so much of that

1692
03:04:25,300 --> 03:04:27,300
Mercy was a hag

1693
03:04:27,700 --> 03:04:30,740
Well, you won't see a collab with any superstitious little company for sure

1694
03:04:31,540 --> 03:04:34,980
Well, yeah, because that'll be on them. It's up to them like like I can't

1695
03:04:37,460 --> 03:04:44,100
Like you probably why don't there's so many stuff here with him. I've seen him like five times

1696
03:04:44,100 --> 03:04:52,900
Sorry, I need meat from your followers. Thank you. Also, you should stop bagging up your people. It's kind of fucking weird

1697
03:04:53,700 --> 03:04:55,700
um

1698
03:04:57,620 --> 03:05:00,900
It's like I can be say so if I want to like

1699
03:05:02,340 --> 03:05:04,340
The only thing that's difficult for me

1700
03:05:05,620 --> 03:05:07,620
Is like maybe not swearing

1701
03:05:08,580 --> 03:05:11,860
But like oh hell I literally that is like glitched. Um

1702
03:05:14,260 --> 03:05:16,260
I

1703
03:05:16,580 --> 03:05:18,580
Like I can do that

1704
03:05:19,620 --> 03:05:22,900
It wouldn't be difficult and then I would just like probably get a fucking different outfit

1705
03:05:23,700 --> 03:05:25,700
But like I also don't want to change

1706
03:05:26,740 --> 03:05:30,500
Who I am. Oh, I was looking at chat. Um

1707
03:05:32,100 --> 03:05:34,100
For somebody just to like me

1708
03:05:35,940 --> 03:05:43,620
And like it's mostly as I run into that it's mostly for the um other girls

1709
03:05:44,100 --> 03:05:47,860
Like I just I just want us to be successful and I want to go to be happy

1710
03:05:53,060 --> 03:05:55,560
My measure success by happiness

1711
03:06:02,980 --> 03:06:06,580
Damn, this is actually a kind of cracked thing

1712
03:06:10,180 --> 03:06:13,540
Oh, what the fuck I'm like, please don't tell me if I'm glitched

1713
03:06:14,820 --> 03:06:16,820
I

1714
03:06:18,580 --> 03:06:22,580

I

1717
03:07:04,100 --> 03:07:06,100
Like I was in a job interview and I said that

1718
03:07:06,500 --> 03:07:11,060
And I'm like a measure of my success where the customer's happiness and they like laugh at me because they want me to talk about

1719
03:07:11,300 --> 03:07:13,300
metrics, so I'm like, oh, okay

1720
03:07:14,260 --> 03:07:16,260
Kind of want to wait

1721
03:07:16,900 --> 03:07:18,900

1722
03:07:23,860 --> 03:07:25,860

03:44:18,020 --> 03:44:20,020
I

2029
03:44:24,420 --> 03:44:30,180
Guess nobody's gonna fucking do their work because they're all ninky running around. Oh glowing poopy

2030
03:44:43,140 --> 03:44:45,140
Cannibal

03:44:48,580 --> 03:44:50,580
Oh

2032
03:44:52,980 --> 03:44:54,980
Music is so good in this game

2033
03:44:58,900 --> 03:45:03,380
I'm all prancing excitedly. What's up?

2034
03:45:08,660 --> 03:45:11,700
Okay, Zara Zara says she wants to go on a mission

Oh

2040
03:45:42,660 --> 03:45:45,140
It's funny because like some people are naky and some people aren't

2041
03:45:56,260 --> 03:45:59,620
This is what I mean. I'm like, oh, I'm gonna end soon. I'm like, wait, I gotta do this first

2042
03:46:00,500 --> 03:46:02,500

2105
03:52:15,060 --> 03:52:17,060
I don't think shawty sleeps at all

2106
03:52:17,140 --> 03:52:20,820
Because she wakes up. No, she doesn't wake up. She's just alive. She's just there

2107
03:52:21,620 --> 03:52:23,620
And then she does so much stuff

2108
03:52:23,620 --> 03:52:26,260
And she streams and she does more stuff. I don't think she sleeps

2109
03:52:26,820 --> 03:52:32,740
I think she's just forever awake. She just has a superpower of being awake all the time

2110
03:52:37,540 --> 03:52:39,540
All right

2111
03:52:39,940 --> 03:52:41,940
