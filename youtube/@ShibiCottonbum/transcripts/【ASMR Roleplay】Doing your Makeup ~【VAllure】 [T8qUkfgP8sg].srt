00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Hi, I don't know if you can hear me.

2
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I don't know if this sounds okay, I'm a bit low.

3
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Hello.

4
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You can hear my EC, it's quite loud, but do you like the white noise or is it bothersome?

5
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I will keep today, thank you.

6
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Hello.

7
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I am trying to add to the effects.

8
00:02:46,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Okay, wait, do I sound okay too?

9
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I think I look nice.

10
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Okay, I just want to make sure.

11
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm very excited, I have on my desk so much stuff.

12
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You can call me big sis.

13
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Pretend you can't see my ball gang under my neck.

14
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:52,000
No, no, I'm just myself today, I'm just wearing a different outfit.

15
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Hello, you guys like the new emote?

16
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Let me see if I can fix that real quick.

17
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You might hear some water in the background, that's my cat's water fountain.

18
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Hold on, I'm taking off my, taking off my, my cat, the clown is your favorite emote.

19
00:05:44,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm very licensed, I'm a licensed esthetician.

20
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:30,000
What the heck?

21
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
There we go.

22
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:46,000
That's better at least.

23
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Yeah, the really intense crying one is one of my favorite past PL emotes and so I had to bring it back.

24
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,000
One of my done doing my makeup, you've only one makeup twice in your life.

25
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Well, I love makeup, I love it a lot actually.

26
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I don't really wear makeup that much anymore because I don't leave my house, but today I'm going to be doing your makeup.

27
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm going to be giving you some personal attention before I go.

28
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I hope you enjoy it, since I leave tomorrow for my trip to see my family.

29
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'll be gone until the 23rd and I'll miss you guys a lot, so I thought I'd be nice today.

30
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And I kind of walk you through like a skincare routine and then I'll brush your hair and do your makeup, give you a little ear massage.

31
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Oh yeah, do you ever do your makeup just to sit around the house?

32
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Yeah, I literally put on like a full face today to get my nails done when I really didn't need to.

33
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I did light blue for my nails and I kept them a shorter length, I didn't do them super long.

34
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So they're nice, they're cute little almond nails.

35
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
A little picture from after stream.

36
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Yeah, I'll miss you guys.

37
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:29,000
This includes, yeah, yeah, I'm going to do your hair, I'm going to wash your hair, I'm going to brush it.

38
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You're going to do a lot of triggers today.

39
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Yeah, I hope you guys enjoy, I hope my AC and my background noise like my cat eating right now is a bit too distracting.

40
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm very nervous for tomorrow because I fly out, my mom's bringing me to the airport.

41
00:08:51,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm very anxious because I haven't flown in a very, very long time and I don't like traveling by myself.

42
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So of course I'll remember you, you'll be all that I'm thinking about when I'm gone.

43
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's going to be so hard.

44
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:23,000
But when I come back, I have a special, special, sorry that was boomy, a special Twitter space I want to do on my alt for you guys.

45
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I had the idea and I was going to do it today but I'm like nah, I'll do it when I come back.

46
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Another thing, I want to apologize in advance because I never recorded the ASMR video that I was supposed to and so it's definitely not going to be edited in time for my absence.

47
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
But I do have some shorts coming so I hope you guys like the shorts.

48
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Yeah, and I'll probably do a Twitter space while I'm there and talk to you guys.

49
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'll be active on social media.

50
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Yeah.

51
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Well, I miss you guys a lot.

52
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Yeah, I'm going to be really sad without the kitties.

53
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
What?

54
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
What is that, Emote?

55
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
What is that?

56
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Oh wait, that's the, it looks really weird reflected on YouTube.

57
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:35,000
The little pen lights look really fucking goofy.

58
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Some of these translate very weirdly on YouTube but it's fine.

59
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Let me tweet that I'm live.

60
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
You don't see anything in my hand.

61
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
There's nothing there.

62
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Okay, let me just...

63
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Um, Boomi is running in circles around the couch. She seems to be having a good time.

64
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Oh, we hit 11k followers on Twitter! Let's go!

65
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
That's awesome. That's so cool.

66
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:22,000
And we're so close to 10k, guys. I'll probably be 10k in the middle of my trip.

67
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Give me some ideas for 10k.

68
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Um, you say...

69
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Oops, I can't type.

70
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Ow, my nose!

71
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Okay.

72
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Maybe tweet this on my own.

73
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:15,600
Maybe Endurance or Donut request ASMR stream?

74
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,600
Maybe.

75
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,600
That's good.

76
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:26,600
Evil witch ASMR roleplaying for the time being.

77
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:35,120
Yeah I think I honestly have to credit um the clipper who clipped us cause that video

78
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:42,520
of like the adult youtuber agency that has almost 100k views and youtube has called us

79
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:48,480
um a few times so I might be called again but um it's just really incredible how just

80
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,760
like a clipper channel that just takes interest in you can really support the growth and I'm

81
00:12:53,760 --> 00:13:03,320
very thankful for that um he discovered me via that video yeah I love reading the comments

82
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:07,720
on that video and people are really funny people think Azera is faking her voice which

83
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:13,000
is I think is my favorite cause that's just how she actually talks she doesn't point

84
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,240
on a voice or anything.

85
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:23,000
I don't know why youtube keeps calling us um again the AI thinks that it's not appropriate

86
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:32,760
growth it thinks that it's not real so it is what it is um I don't know why I'm so anxious

87
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,080
I'm feeling very shy.

88
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:46,720
Well me can you please stop I don't know if you guys heard that.

89
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,800
I hope I won't have to congratulate you we might actually I won't be surprised if I

90
00:13:50,800 --> 00:14:01,920
dip below 10k and then get back up to it and she's very excitable right now.

right this is why you get lice every year you're not washing your hair

286
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,880

288
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:25,000
on my hair I conditioner every other day and then I'll do shampoo once a week

289
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:34,680
it's called a cold wash so I recommend that if you have curly hair I can

290
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:41,960
stop moving

291
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:53,000

293
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,880
I can't believe you want to go to school like this

294
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:18,200

00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,480
trying to wet your hair

00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:24,440
see it wasn't that bad it wasn't that bad you're not gonna go bald

372
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:32,840
okay now that I brushed your hair out I'm just gonna let your hair air dry um

373
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:36,920
I think I don't want to like use my hair dryer on you it'll be too loud

374
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:43,880
so now that

375
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:53,000
we did your hair we brushed it out it looks nice it looks so nice down really really good um

376
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:56,200
now I'm gonna do your skincare okay

377
00:50:57,080 --> 00:51:09,080
so um I'm gonna go and already washed your face so I'm going to use a chemical exfoliant

378
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:13,880
this is what I watched on on on YouTube

379
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:19,880
so don't worry a chemical exfoliant isn't bad it's fine

380
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:27,560
so you have a very unique um balance on your face and so you want to balance your AHA

381
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:36,360
and your um BHA on your face um it's better to use a chemical exfoliant than a physical

382
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:42,680
exfoliant because physical exfoliant can make micro tears in your skin and the micro tears in

383
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:50,280
your skin can cause acne and cause your skin to be very sensitive um so I'm using uh Paula's Choice

384
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:55,880
exfoliant on your face it's not gonna burn

385
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:07,880
I'm just gonna put some on this cotton pad

386
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:16,680
okay I don't have a lot of product left in us

387
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:26,760
it's fine I watched it on YouTube it's what the beauty guru told me to do

388
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:37,400
no I know you normally use soap and water but sometimes just soap and water can dry out your

389
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:42,680
skin and you want to make sure you're fully at your skin otherwise you're gonna get black heads

390
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:51,240
and white heads and acne and I'm trying to help you okay it's also good for discoloration

391
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:59,000
so let me wipe your face close your close your eyes close your eyes

392
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:01,400
good goodennnina

393
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:12,120
close close close c c c c c c c c c c

394
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:16,200

395
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,920
okay good good good good good

396
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:20,920
Good, good, good, good, good.

397
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,920
Well, now, keep your head straight.

398
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:39,920
Don't open your eyes.

399
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,920
Do you want me to poke you in the eye? It'll burn if it goes in your eye.

400
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:58,920
You can't peek. I'm not peeking.

401
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:08,920
This is what happens. You have to hold your head straight.

402
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:20,920
You're doing a good job.

403
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:30,920
So I'm using a cotton pad and I'm just wiping this along your face.

404
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:56,920
Cotton pad or cousins also? I think we do have a cousin in cotton pad.

405
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:09,920
Don't turn your head. Stay still. I need to get a spark by your nose.

406
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:20,920
See, it doesn't have any on eyes to be peppered.

407
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,920
Please do not sneeze in my face.

408
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:39,920
Hold on. Is that cotton on your face?

409
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:11,920
Okay, I think it's good.

410
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:21,920
So now that I put the chemical exfoliant, I don't want to put on a serum that's another type of exfoliant.

411
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,920
I'm not going to do lack of the gas or anything.

412
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:29,920
So I'm just going to go in with just a caudally serum.

413
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:34,920
It's a Xenome Perfection.

414
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:56,920
It smells good. I'm going to put it a little bit more.

415
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:11,920
Okay, I'm going to tap this on your face.

416
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,920
It smells like flowers.

417
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:24,920
You want to pat it and you don't want to rub in the serum. You always want to pat your serum.

418
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,920
Okay.

419
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:06,920
Nice.

420
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:21,920
Now that I've got a serum on your face, I'm going to put on a...

421
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:25,920
Let's see, what is this called?

422
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:33,920
I'm going to put some sunscreen on you because no matter what skin tone you are, sun is very powerful.

423
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:37,920
You want to avoid skin damage.

424
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:44,920
Let's shake it up.

425
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:49,920
This is Innisfree sunscreen.

426
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,920
That's beautiful.

427
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:54,920
It smells like flowers.

428
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:12,920
I'm going to dab it onto my hand.

429
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,920
Okay.

430
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:30,920
I'm going to rub this into your skin.

431
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:38,920
You always want to make sure that your skincare dries down before you go on to the next thing.

432
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:44,920
Okay.

433
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:58,920
Get some more.

434
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:14,920
Okay.

435
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,920
You want it?

436
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:28,920
The trick is with sunscreen, hold out your...

437
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:30,920
Yeah, give me your hand.

438
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,920
Give me your hand.

439
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,920
I'm not going to bite your hand.

440
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:41,920
So what you want to do is you want to hold out your first two fingers, so your index finger and your middle finger.

441
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:48,920
And then the amount of sunscreen you want has to be aligned on both fingers.

442
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:50,920
And then you can...

443
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:53,920
You want to incorporate that all in.

444
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:58,920
Even if you're dark skinned, you need sunscreen.

445
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:03,920
You can still get skin cancer, even if you're brown.

446
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:07,920
You can still get sunburn, even if you're brown.

447
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:18,920
Okay.

448
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:21,920
I think I put too much on my hands, but your face is fine.

449
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,920
Let me go wash my hands.

450
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:35,920
Okay.

451
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:54,920
Why are you still here? I thought you were going to run away.

452
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:56,920
That's right, I locked the door.

453
01:01:56,920 --> 01:02:00,920
Um, as dark skin this is cat.

454
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:13,920
They don't know that I'm also brown.

455
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:16,920
They don't know that I'm brown.

456
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:19,920
Um, anyways.

457
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:27,920
So the next thing I'm going to do is I'm just going to put on some lotion on your lips.

458
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:33,920
That's not the lotion.

459
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:36,920
That's the lotion.

460
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:41,920
Did you take the lotion?

461
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:44,920
Give it, give it back.

462
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:46,920
Sheesh.

463
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:58,920
You want to use a non-fragment lotion, just something basic, like CeraVe.

464
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:01,920
CeraVe is really good.

465
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:16,920
Because sometimes the fragrance can irritate your skin.

466
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:26,920
Make sure that when you select a, um, what's it called?

467
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:28,920
A lotion.

468
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:32,920
You don't want it to have like the first thing, sometimes it's alcohol.

469
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:39,920
And the ingredient list, you don't want it to be alcohol.

470
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:49,920
If you're, if you're very acne prone, I recommend doing a spot treatment of Penoxel.

471
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,920
Um, that's the brand name.

472
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:56,920
But it's good. You don't want to put it all over your face because it can dry out your skin.

473
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:59,920
But you can just dab it on.

474
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:29,920
I don't have my normal lotion, so I'm just putting on bath and body on you though.

475
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:33,920
Normally I wouldn't put this on my face, I'll just put it on my body.

476
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:39,920
Because your face skin is very sensitive.

477
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:42,920
It smells very good though.

478
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:45,920
It's a thousand wishes.

479
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:55,920
It's a thousand wishes.

480
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:25,920
It's a thousand wishes.

481
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:28,920
It's a thousand wishes.

482
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:31,920
It's a thousand wishes.

483
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:34,920
It's a thousand wishes.

484
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:37,920
It's a thousand wishes.

485
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:40,920
It's a thousand wishes.

486
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:43,920
It's a thousand wishes.

487
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:47,920
It's a thousand wishes.

488
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:51,920
Okay.

489
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:59,920
Kiddyl, you look like you're really up and sleepy.

490
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:03,920
Do you like putting lotion on your face?

491
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:05,920
That's funny.

492
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:24,920
Are you falling asleep?

493
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:34,920
I am falling asleep wake up.

494
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:44,920
Are you falling asleep?

495
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:47,920
I am falling asleep wake up.

496
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,920
Wake up.

497
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:57,920
Nightmare, nightmare, nightmare.

498
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:03,920
I can't get more of the lotion.

499
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:11,920
I know about the different content.

500
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:15,920
You never want to put any sort of oil on your face

501
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:17,920
because I can clog your pores.

502
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:20,920
Coins I have to put.

503
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:22,920
I've got a serum.

504
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:29,920
I need to put a serum that helps with your pores.

505
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:32,920
It's called Nekamad.

506
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:34,920
Nekamad.

507
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:38,920
Go away, go away.

508
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:41,920
Go away, go away.

509
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:43,920
Go away.

510
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:46,920
Go away.

511
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:59,920
I want to use my headscarf with a free bottle.

512
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:02,920
You know we have four layers of product on right now.

513
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:06,920
You just have a toner, which is the Paula's Choice.

514
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:11,920
You have a serum, you have sunscreen, and now you have lotion.

515
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:13,920
Go away.

516
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:15,920
Go away.

517
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:17,920
Go away.

518
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:19,920
Go away.

519
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:21,920
Go away.

520
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:24,920
Go away.

521
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:50,920
I'm almost done rubbing it in.

522
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:52,920
Just a little bit longer.

523
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:13,920
Go away.

524
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:30,920
I'm going to use this to rub it in.

525
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:38,920
It's so watery.

526
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,920
Let me wipe my hands off.

527
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:55,920
Okay.

528
01:09:57,920 --> 01:09:59,920
Brush.

529
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:06,920
This is more than it.

530
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:15,920
Yeah, yeah, I love you too.

531
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:24,920
I just want to say thank you for helping me out with this so far.

532
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:26,920
Your skin is looking really nice.

533
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:29,920
You look like you're going.

534
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:57,920
Okay, we think you need the makeup, but that's too bad because I still want to practice.

535
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:09,920
Okay, so now that we did your skin care, I'm going to do your makeup.

536
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:13,920
So first, when you do your makeup, you want to start with the primer.

537
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:20,920
I'm going to use the NYX primer.

538
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:22,920
No, is it Elf or NYX?

539
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:25,920
Sorry, it's the Elf Supergrip primer.

540
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:27,920
It's the blue one.

541
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:33,920
It's really good at holding your makeup in place.

542
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:35,920
At least that's what the YouTube videos have.

543
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:41,920
Okay, so now I'm going to do your skin care.

544
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:43,920
Okay, so now I'm going to do your skin care.

545
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:45,920
Okay, so now I'm going to do your skin care.

546
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:47,920
Okay, so now I'm going to do your skin care.

547
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:49,920
Okay, so now I'm going to do your skin care.

548
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:51,920
Okay, so now I'm going to do your skin care.

549
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:53,920
Okay, so now I'm going to do your skin care.

550
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:55,920
Okay, so now I'm going to do your skin care.

551
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:57,920
Okay, so now I'm going to do your skin care.

552
01:11:57,920 --> 01:11:59,920
Okay, so now I'm going to do your skin care.

553
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:01,920
Okay, so now I'm going to do your skin care.

554
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:03,920
Okay, so now I'm going to do your skin care.

555
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,920
Okay, so now I'm going to do your skin care.

556
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:11,920
okay, let me put this.

557
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:25,920
oops, so sorry.

558
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:31,920
I'm gonna cut a little Tine, just like that.

559
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:33,920
just going to rub this into your skin,

560
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:37,920
into your skin. I'm just gonna kind of like pat it.

561
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:48,920
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. It's okay. It's okay. Don't cry. Please don't cry.

562
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:57,920
Okay. It's okay. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Yeah, I'll take you for ice cream.

563
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:08,920
I can't. Come on. I'm kissing your ear better.

564
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:15,920
Stop crying. Yeah, I'll take you for ice cream. Please don't cry. I'll take you for ice cream.

565
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:25,920
Yeah, you can have whatever flavor you want.

566
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:40,920
Okay, a bottle.

567
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:46,920
I'm gonna wipe my hands off.

568
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:53,920
Now that we have your skin primed, I'm gonna go in with the foundation.

569
01:13:53,920 --> 01:14:09,920
Normally, I use new personally. I use S.T.A. water, but for you, I'm not gonna use a $50 foundation.

570
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:19,920
So I'm gonna just use the Maybelline Fit Me foundation. I can get like, you know what I'm saying?

571
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:28,920
And it is matte, porous, and it lasts 12 hours.

572
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:42,920
I got your skin tone. So it should be a good match.

573
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:54,920
Yeah, makeup's really expensive. You have no idea how much I spend on makeup.

574
01:14:55,920 --> 01:15:03,920
That's why I haven't been wearing it as often. That's why I've been trying to shop for more drugstore brands.

575
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:09,920
Because usually, there's an expression in the beauty community called a dupe.

576
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:15,920
So the dupe is usually has like the same formula, but it's not like the super big name brand.

577
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:20,920
But they're very similar. They might be like one or two key differences.

578
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:25,920
But otherwise, they're essentially the same.

579
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:33,920
That's a good question. Why am I painting your face the same tone it already is?

580
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:39,920
So this is gonna even out your skin tone, because not everybody has flawless glass skin.

581
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:53,920
And if you wanted to like, cover up any deeper pores or any acne scars or anything, that would be good.

582
01:15:53,920 --> 01:16:03,920
Sometimes people will use a concealer first if they have like, it's called under-concealing or under-painting.

583
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:11,920
So they will conceal the spots first and then they'll go over with a foundation.

584
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:18,920
I prefer to do foundation and concealer mostly because I don't really have a lot of spots to cover.

585
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:26,920
I'll just do concealer under my eyes, because sometimes I like dark circles because the concealer doesn't sleep well.

586
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:30,920
On the left, get this.

587
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:41,920
Like priming a wall before painting is a good question.

588
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:45,920
You don't want a little bit of concealer though. You don't want a lot of concealer.

589
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:48,920
I'm gonna go into the concealer first.

590
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:51,920
I'll look concealer under your eyes.

591
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:01,920
Why would you spend so much on makeup?

592
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:04,920
Okay, mom's spending a lot of time on makeup.

593
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:07,920
Okay, I won't tell mom this and that.

594
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:09,920
I think, I don't know.

595
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:15,920
There is like a, sometimes a definite difference in like, more expensive makeup.

596
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:20,920
I only really get the more expensive stuff for like, certain things.

597
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:25,920
So like, I'll get an expensive foundation because that's the thing that I'll be most seeing on my face.

598
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:28,920
But then everything else, I'll be like, very cheap.

599
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:33,920
Like, I'll use, like, I like color pop a lot because they're really good for nose or stuff.

600
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:36,920
But they don't break the bank.

601
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:42,920
Like, I got a lot of blushes and eyeshadow palettes from them.

602
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:47,920
But yeah, I'll get like, a really nice foundation and everything else.

603
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:50,920
I'll be like, drugstore brand.

604
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:54,920
I think that's what a lot of people do too.

605
01:17:57,920 --> 01:17:58,920
Of course.

606
01:17:58,920 --> 01:17:59,920
Happy time.

607
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:00,920
Happy time.

608
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:01,920
Okay.

609
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:03,920
On the dress.

610
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:11,920
I'm going to go on with my fingers for this.

611
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:18,920
So for me personally, I go in and put foundation on my face with my fingers.

612
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:21,920
And I kind of finger paint it on.

613
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:25,920
But then, I pat it out with a makeup sponge.

614
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:27,920
Usually a wet makeup sponge.

615
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:31,920
It just makes it, um, it's really good for liquid makeup.

616
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:37,920
Uh, just to kind of like, I don't know, make you have like more glowy days.

617
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:39,920
I know you can't use crayons.

618
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:40,920
I know you eat crayons.

619
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:43,920
No, you can't use them on your face either.

620
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:52,920
That's on that side, and I'm just going to rub that into my face.

621
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:54,920
Lightly.

622
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:08,920
You told me the people on the internet.

623
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:10,920
Really, you've got to do what works for you.

624
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:13,920
It's a lot of trial and error.

625
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:20,920
Um, and I've changed my makeup routine a lot over the years.

626
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:23,920
Uh, I've also tried to put crayon on my face.

627
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:30,920
You might be able to do pastels, like actual wax pastels, I don't know.

628
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:31,920
Oh, you can eat them.

629
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:32,920
Oh, you can eat them.

630
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:34,920
Please don't eat them.

631
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:37,920
Uh, no wonder why the kids at school think you're weird.

632
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:40,920
I mean, what?

633
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:44,920
Um, there are like makeup sticks that look like giant crayons, though.

634
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:47,920
It's kind of funny, they're just like foundation sticks.

635
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:48,920
Probably even a marker.

636
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:52,920
Yeah, that comes off with alcohol, though.

637
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:55,920
Yeah, I know like, oh yeah, a lot of beauty.

638
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:58,920
And you just like swipe the stick on your face.

639
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:01,920
I don't use that though, because it just doesn't work for me.

640
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:02,920
I don't know.

641
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:04,920
It feels weird.

642
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:06,920
I don't like heavy makeup.

643
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:08,920
I like makeup that feels light.

644
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:11,920
I like using the milk brand for makeup.

645
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:14,920
Um, but they're expensive, so I don't really get them anymore.

646
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:21,920
I used to get their Sunshine Skin Tint, but that thing was like 40 bucks.

647
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:22,920
Okay.

648
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:28,920
So, I already have all that makeup sponge here, so I'm going to dab this and kind of blend it.

649
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:31,920
So I'm going to blend this into your skin.

650
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:40,920
Don't move.

651
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:42,920
Close your eyes.

652
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:44,920
Close your eyes.

653
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:45,920
Close your eyes.

654
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:47,920
Close your eyes.

655
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:49,920
Close your eyes.

656
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,920
Close your eyes.

657
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:57,920
Close your eyes.

658
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:04,920
good job

659
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:06,920
good job, just a bit of sound

660
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:08,920
just a bit of sound

661
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:16,920
do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do

01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:12,620
Okay, that things up and it out really nice

667
01:22:12,660 --> 01:22:14,180
um, I'm gonna conceal under it.

668
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:15,140
I had a little bit.

669
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:17,780
Did you sleep last night or are you out playing games?

670
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:21,160
You're mom, you know mom doesn't like it.

671
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:23,000
I'm gonna play games.

672
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Oh my god, I'm gonna stub this. Oh no. Cool.

673
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:51,000
You know you're not supposed to stay up late. Don't stay up late.

674
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:57,000
I'm mixing up the concealer. Mixing up the concealer.

675
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Okay, I think I mixed it.

676
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Where should I go with this?

677
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Should maybe go under the spine.

678
01:23:51,000 --> 01:24:04,000
So usually I blend out my concealer with the same sponge, but I'm just gonna use a different brush.

679
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Okay, don't move. Don't move, don't move, don't move.

680
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Okay, I'm gonna put it right under your mouth.

681
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:22,000
I'm gonna put it under your nose.

682
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:50,000

don't stay still stay still

694
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:36,400
so

695
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:48,080
okay you did it you did such a good job i know i know where i know where i just noticed a couple

696
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:56,560
of tweezers i should have tweezed them out here but i forgot i'm sorry i'm sorry

697
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:06,320
okay okay so we do your eyebrows i have um where is my eyebrow pencil so you can use

698
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:12,960
like a pomade that sometimes i use i used to use anastasia but i really use eyebrow pomade

699
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:21,760
now i just do that for my eyebrows and test it a little bit and i'm just gonna use

700
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:31,760
there you go i forgot to grab it pomade don't move don't move

701
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:43,760
okay

702
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:54,160
so i have a the mix my eyebrow pencil i'm just gonna pull in your eyebrows real quick did you like

703
01:28:56,960 --> 01:29:01,040
shave your eyebrow off by the way did you

704
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:09,840
maybe shave your eyebrows actually before i do do that i'm gonna set and you set your foundation

705
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:17,840
i'm so stupid okay i have long marcia translucent setting powder

706
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:27,040
i'll do your eyebrows after i set your foundation because the eyebrow pencil is gonna slide around

707
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:29,200
if i don't set it with the powder

708
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:30,320
here

709
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:40,000
because i put a liquid so setting this kind of makes it more stable it makes it not want to move

710
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:49,200
i have my brush here

711
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:56,080
okay so i'm gonna

712
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:03,280
setting powder

713
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:12,160
and i'm gonna put a little bit under your eyes just to bake under your eyes a little bit and

714
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:16,400
what baking is it just it's a longer time to set so the makeup does increase

715
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:22,800
so it fills it all the gaps but you have my skin you don't have any wrinkles or bad pores so you're fine

716
01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:31,520
i'm gonna tap off the excess

717
01:30:40,640 --> 01:30:41,360
and it's gonna

718
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:54,320
i'm sorry i didn't mean to pull out your ears

719
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:02,320
keep your eyes closed

720
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:18,320
so

721
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:32,000
translucent setting powder it's good to get either translucent powder or powder that

722
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:37,600
matches your skin just because you don't want to end up like change trials and look like the

723
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:44,560
spider from whatever ttb show was where you just have like it's called flashback face

724
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:51,840
you're like hi sisters are you just scary buddy

725
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:58,160
what happened to me i remember i was out with my family and i think they took a picture of me at

726
01:31:58,160 --> 01:32:04,560
church and my face was just like white my neck was brown because i put the wrong um setting powder

727
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:09,600
on and it looked really funny

728
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:31,600
right now i'm just gonna brush it off

729
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:43,600
my day is going well thank you

730
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:59,600
i'm gonna sat nice on your face so i'm just gonna brush it off

731
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:05,680
emi it looks like she wants to come over and she's bringing friends hello ragers

732
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:12,160

735
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:26,880
time with me

736
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:38,560
oh too much makeup long-term ruined skin that's a great question sibling um it actually won't

737
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:44,240
as long as you properly clean it off if you can't put on makeup every day and you didn't wash your

738
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:50,640
face then yes it will damage your skin but nothing in makeup um can really damage you unless you're

739
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:58,160
allergic to like a fragrance or something i like a something within the makeup otherwise you should

740
01:33:58,160 --> 01:34:02,800
be fine i've been wearing makeup for 50 years and i look great

741
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:10,880
how are you doing the bells are you doing how you doing i hope you're doing well i hope you're

742
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:23,120
doing well i hope you're doing well

743
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:47,040
well for example you pass out without falling asleep without taking off makeup um that's a

744
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:54,320
great question you might wake up with like a bit um because it does it can clog your pores if you

745
01:34:54,320 --> 01:35:00,880
don't wash it out um but if you wake up you said to wash it off in the morning it shouldn't cause

746
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:08,480
any long-term damage i've fallen asleep with makeup on before from the morning i just like wash my

747
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:14,960
face really good exfoliate put all the gunk out i'll usually take extra care um and do a little

748
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:21,040
bit extra steps in my skincare routine whatever really happens i think it's only happened to me

749
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:28,560
like once or twice um even if i'm like not feeling good i usually i will always take my makeup off

750
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:39,920
um if you're wondering how to wash your face after you have makeup on because you're probably

751
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:47,680
wondering oh she you just did a primer to really make the foundation stay you just set it to your

752
01:35:47,680 --> 01:35:54,480
skin how am i supposed to get this off well there are special cleansers you can get get it off usually

753
01:35:54,720 --> 01:36:00,960
oil based cleanser um oil cleansers are ones that are good for your skin and when i say like

754
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:06,480
don't put oil on your face i mean like paper that's not the same type of oil that's a heavier um

755
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:11,920
it's like a it's a mineral oil with fragrance that's not what like a facial like a cleansing bomb does

756
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:21,120
um yeah my cellar water is good no not all of oil um as you know actually eggs are good for a

757
01:36:21,120 --> 01:36:26,880
face mask eggs are very good uh do not put mineral oil on your face please that will clog your pores

758
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:34,560
um you can use makeup wipes so what i do i use um do not clean your face with vegetable oil um

759
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:42,640
i usually go in with the makeup wipes and i wipe my makeup off of the wipe and something like that

760
01:36:42,640 --> 01:36:46,160
actually i have some makeup wipes right here

761
01:36:55,280 --> 01:37:01,520
and this usually has like my cellar water in it oh no i don't have contact

762
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:04,640
let's go for wipe let's go

763
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:09,600
um

764
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:21,120
and after that i'll usually go in with a salic acid cleaner so that sounds scary when it is but

765
01:37:21,120 --> 01:37:28,640
again um salic acid is a chemical exfoliant um that is okay and safe for your skin and small

766
01:37:28,640 --> 01:37:34,480
doses so there's a certain percentage of acid in there um and so i'll do

767
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:42,080
just makeup permanently okay it's fine um

768
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:49,600
you know don't put gas when you're running in here and um

769
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:06,880
and uh i usually do that uh do i usually use um what's it called the ordinary

770
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:12,560
no it's the balm i have called a good old cleansing balm

771
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:15,760
hold on now i need to work it's gonna bother me

772
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:26,000
it's gonna bother me oh i'm getting big don't worry about it stop stop getting big

773
01:38:29,120 --> 01:38:32,000
okay

774
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:51,440
it's called the anti-wrist so for skincare the anti-wrist that you can get like

775
01:38:51,440 --> 01:38:59,680
Sephora or i think Ulta as well um i don't remember but uh the ingredients and the ordinary are

776
01:38:59,680 --> 01:39:05,040
very affordable um and they're the basic of the ingredients so that's definitely crazy

777
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:10,800
okay i don't know what about me

778
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:14,640
and um

779
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:15,440
um

780
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:23,440
i use the old cleansing balm from that and then i wash my face with the old cleansing balm

781
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:25,760
i double wash

782
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:32,800
but again you also don't want to over wash your face because if you over wash your face you can

783
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:40,640
also strip your face of bacteria that needs to be on your face um and it can mess up your

784
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:45,840
skin so you want to make sure you use the right stuff to clean your skin

785
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:53,040
because you don't want to strip it of its natural oil and then the dryness um can make you break

786
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:59,760
out as well because then your body overcompensates for the lack of natural oils and begins to

787
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:03,040
over reduce oil you don't want that to happen

788
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:13,600
so that's why you don't want to just go in with like a hand soap and water because the hand soap

789
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:21,360
is meant to strip any bad bacteria from your hands and it won't dry out your skin and that

790
01:40:21,360 --> 01:40:24,560
um you don't want to use that on your face because it's hand soap

791
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:32,640
if you have a good type of soap that's hydrating and then you put on lotion afterwards then

792
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:37,280
you're fine but sometimes um you want to make sure that you hydrate your skin

793
01:40:38,080 --> 01:40:46,720
um or use like a hydrating cleanser or hydrating soap otherwise you don't dry out your skin and

794
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:56,880
it will cause more quick gout okay now that i set your makeup your foundation i plucked your eyebrows

795
01:40:56,880 --> 01:40:59,760
let's go in and actually do your eyebrows i'm not filling in

796
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:09,680
so i need to make it bigger the crayon part is pretty small it's kind of like a pencil

797
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:12,640
it's called the mix micro brow pencil

798
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:25,360
you don't want to use a five in one face wash because think about it your skin on your body

799
01:41:25,360 --> 01:41:34,320
your skin on your face um and your hair you're all different um your skin is a giant organ

800
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:37,600
it's the biggest organ in your body you want to make sure you take care of it accordingly

801
01:41:38,640 --> 01:41:42,240
and if you use the same product i don't know it's not going to have the same effect

802
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:51,200
so yes cleanser toner serum sunscreen motion yes exactly good job

803
01:41:56,320 --> 01:42:01,120
okay so it turns out i am using this to wash my face in the morning

804
01:42:02,720 --> 01:42:04,800
yeah no soap not soap soup

805
01:42:07,120 --> 01:42:11,520
i've been drying out my skin it's not the acne only some more acne took it yeah

806
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:17,280
so your body will overproduce oil and it'll clog your skin so if you just get like a nice

807
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:22,080
base like again sarah v um i'm gonna give you guys some typical drugstore brands

808
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:38,320
so if you get like uh love rose poise uh sarah v um

809
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:42,400
let me see

810
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:51,360
see the fill is really good you also want to know everybody's skin is different um so i have

811
01:42:51,360 --> 01:42:58,720
combination skin uh so there's uh there's dry skin combination skin and oily skin um so i have

812
01:42:58,720 --> 01:43:04,560
patches of my skin that are dry and i have patches that are oily um so you want to make sure you

813
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:10,480
have a cleanser for that but if you really dry skin you want to have a more hydrating um water

814
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:24,800
based uh um cleanser and and if you have a um oily skin you want um something that won't be as

815
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:31,680
heavy on your skin otherwise you're just gonna clock it up again uh so yeah and you also you

816
01:43:31,680 --> 01:43:40,080
might have sensitive skin it's a lot of trial and error to get the right uh type of um skin

817
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:47,600
care routine that's why i really like seida fill and sarah v because uh you can get like a gentle

818
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:52,320
foaming cleanser to start off with and um you can kind of work your way up from there

819
01:43:52,320 --> 01:44:02,080
and then like i used to have oily skin but now i have combination skin yeah vino is good

820
01:44:02,080 --> 01:44:09,280
ole dove dove is surprising is like dove is trusted and true yeah skin ph exactly

821
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:17,040
um your diet does also factor in uh don't wash your please don't wash your face with hand soap

822
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:23,680
again when you wash your face with hand soap your hands come into contact with lots of different

823
01:44:23,680 --> 01:44:29,520
bacteria you use that to maneuver things in the world it's a very harsh soap because your hands

824
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:35,120
can handle it um because that's what they're meant for but then your face it's not meant for that

825
01:44:35,280 --> 01:44:39,760
i'll put it on your face

826
01:44:43,680 --> 01:44:48,800
do not put hand sanitizer on your face that just lets it burn um you can spot treat

827
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:55,280
if you're gonna spot treat something um you can put like a little dab of a witch hazel or a little

828
01:44:55,280 --> 01:45:03,360
dab of um alcohol like rubbing alcohol just to dry it out um but you want to do that if it's not

829
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:10,880
if your skin isn't positively um reacting to that then stop you really want to try you want to

830
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:16,400
test stuff out you never want to go in put something all over your face you want to spot check stuff

831
01:45:17,120 --> 01:45:24,960
otherwise um you might irritate your skin and you don't want to irritate your skin

832
01:45:25,280 --> 01:45:36,320
like i love um miyana and i love her uh lingerie brand the savage xfifty um she also has a skincare

833
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:44,400
brand uh i have a friend and her skin works amazing with her skincare brand but then i discovered

834
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:50,080
that i am actually allergic to something in her skincare when i tried it out she had really awesome

835
01:45:50,160 --> 01:45:53,840
toner and like lotion and stuff but i don't know what i was allergic to

836
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:58,240
and it would make my skin break out even more now that's just me it works for other people

837
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:01,200
it might not work for you it might work for you

838
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:08,800
sorry she be society doesn't advertise to guys how to take care of your skin

839
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:17,040
yeah that's because for you guys from men it's mostly focused that you you know eat well and you

840
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:23,920
look good physically um in terms of like your body type um for women it's really our face and like

841
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:33,600
i'll wait so i'm not um they don't usually um uh they won't i know like some brands like they'll

842
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:40,720
advertise stuff like my dad is a very meticulously groomed man sometimes i'll make fun of him for

843
01:46:40,720 --> 01:46:46,400
that and sometimes my mom does but he like my dad will do his skincare um and stuff too um

844
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:54,880
and he'll do like an under eye cream and then do like a special lotion um also if you're elderly

845
01:46:54,880 --> 01:47:01,840
like myself i'm 56 um you want to you can add like a serum if you get like a retinol cream

846
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:09,040
a retinol is really good for anti aging um you want to i highly recommend there's a i can't remember

847
01:47:09,040 --> 01:47:14,080
exactly what it's called but there's a cycle you want to go through when it comes to your skin

848
01:47:14,080 --> 01:47:19,920
care for the best results um and you want to cycle through the serums use i'm not going to get into

849
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:31,600
all that you can just youtube that but there is like a cycle women are just very more particular

850
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:41,040
about how we groom ourselves because again we groom ourselves for men um and then obviously

851
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:46,880
for ourselves as well because what makes us feel good but um and a lot of female feminine products

852
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:52,720
were created by men so it's very interesting but then the men don't use that for themselves because

853
01:47:52,720 --> 01:47:58,480
normally it doesn't affect them as much because again our hormones um

854
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:04,880
are different than men men like we both have testosterone and estrogen we do some different

855
01:48:04,880 --> 01:48:14,880
levels it can be expensive but um there are so many budget friendly uh routines you can do

856
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:24,320
whether it may be for makeup or for um what's it called or for skincare like i didn't come out the

857
01:48:24,320 --> 01:48:33,280
gate using like tart and like really expensive makeup and skincare brands oh i just want to

858
01:48:33,280 --> 01:48:41,040
like cvs or ride aid and just like got the basic stuff that's all you really need yeah it's chemistry

859
01:48:45,200 --> 01:48:54,000
yeah that is the pink tax that's usually well i'll buy like some men's products like i'll buy

860
01:48:54,000 --> 01:49:00,560
men's deodorant and i'll buy men's razors because women's razors are also not as well made

861
01:49:01,200 --> 01:49:08,880
same with the deodorant and um they will be a lot more expensive like one razor for a woman

862
01:49:08,880 --> 01:49:12,240
might be like 20 bucks but for a guy who'll get like three for the same amount

863
01:49:17,680 --> 01:49:24,000
um and really again i will recommend for like budget friendly stuff i like sarah v and setafil

864
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:30,000
um you can just search like 13 best 12 best 10 best drugstore brands

865
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:39,840
does it men's deodorant smell like men yeah but my hair products overwhelm what my armpits smell

866
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:46,480
like so you only really smell my hair and my hair smells like candy so i still smell like a girl

867
01:49:51,040 --> 01:49:55,040
i want to do a face routine but i'm scared i might ruin my face more i guess i'll just water um

868
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:02,160
um actually if you you know there's stuff in your water right like if you use just half water

869
01:50:03,440 --> 01:50:09,840
your water can be hard it can have like um different ph levels in it that can also dry out your skin

870
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:20,640
three and one stuff is bad don't use three and one stuff if you're gonna get get get separate

871
01:50:20,640 --> 01:50:27,200
stuff you want something that will specially shampoo your hair you don't want to use the same

872
01:50:27,200 --> 01:50:31,040
stuff on your hair as on your body it might not be as effective i swear so

873
01:50:36,400 --> 01:50:40,400
but um if your skin is sensitive then you need to act accordingly

874
01:50:40,400 --> 01:50:48,960
so i'm just tapping on this pen it's on the tap on with my hair

875
01:50:51,600 --> 01:50:52,960
i'm just gonna brush

876
01:50:56,880 --> 01:50:59,520
my brows a little bit they're a little bit wild

877
01:51:03,280 --> 01:51:10,160
what's nice about this next thing is that i can um it has one end be the pencil and one end be

878
01:51:10,160 --> 01:51:12,480
the brush i can just brush it

879
01:51:21,040 --> 01:51:26,720
but honestly i bet that i don't um again i only know like girl recommendations so

880
01:51:26,720 --> 01:51:33,760
if you want me to guys i can i can do some research for you and i can make like another

881
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:40,240
doing your like face and skin um but i can cure it specifically towards men um

882
01:51:41,360 --> 01:51:46,720
not that this won't work for you but i'll just specifically use like men's brands um and if

883
01:51:46,720 --> 01:51:52,320
you have a beard maybe you'll like like i'm in the beard oil or if you're bald like a bald man

884
01:51:52,320 --> 01:52:02,880
oil doesn't an electric razor work for a body here too so you don't have to get so many disposable

885
01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:09,200
ones um women don't really get marketed electric razors men do for when they shave their beavers

886
01:52:09,200 --> 01:52:10,160
and stuff but women don't

887
01:52:17,120 --> 01:52:19,200
okay now that

888
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:29,520
uh

889
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:39,520
do light strokes

890
01:52:40,240 --> 01:52:45,840
short light strokes

891
01:52:56,160 --> 01:53:03,440
i remember i like got manscaped for myself because again i wanted like men's razors are

892
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:09,040
significantly cheaper now i just use drill it men's razors are significantly cheaper than women's

893
01:53:09,040 --> 01:53:13,040
and i don't like manscaped because i kept making my kuchi anytime i tried to shave

894
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:17,760
and i kept cutting my legs on accident so i don't know if the blades were so sharp

895
01:53:17,760 --> 01:53:22,560
i want to try getting a single blade blade single edge whatever those things are called

896
01:53:24,240 --> 01:53:31,360
you know how hard it hurts so much when you cut your pussy lip it hurts a lot guys

897
01:53:39,200 --> 01:53:43,120
well there's me using all the things seems more than against nobody's skin is different

898
01:53:43,120 --> 01:53:47,040
what will work for someone will not work for you what will work for you might not work for

899
01:53:47,040 --> 01:53:51,520
someone else doesn't miss sharing my knowledge you don't have to change anything it's just

900
01:53:51,520 --> 01:53:58,720
suggestions and recommendations and sometimes it's also down to genetics like it's that simple

901
01:53:58,720 --> 01:54:02,880
like you might not have to do anything you just wake up throw water on your face and you walk out

902
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:10,080
the door and that could be genetic me i'm more acne prone um my mom still has acne and she's

903
01:54:10,080 --> 01:54:17,680
in her 70s and i'm 50 um and i just never went away and so i get the occasional breakout when

904
01:54:17,680 --> 01:54:23,520
i was normal when you're in an age when you're a man and a woman um you stop breaking out but

905
01:54:24,160 --> 01:54:30,720
genetically just don't so i try to do preventative measures to stop really bad breakouts

906
01:54:34,320 --> 01:54:41,360
sometimes it's a hormonal thing um so like for example i'm on medication for um

907
01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:50,320
my acne because i'll get it like on my body that's annoying because i can't i told you guys

908
01:54:50,320 --> 01:54:55,600
like i scar easily so like you know red dot for me it just turned into a brown dot and so i'll

909
01:54:55,600 --> 01:55:13,040
just have like spots and i'm like i'm a leopard so i'll take i take um like a antibiotic and it

910
01:55:13,040 --> 01:55:22,480
actually kills the bacteria that makes um okay so your eyebrows are nicely filled in i gave you a

911
01:55:22,480 --> 01:55:33,520
good arc um so now i'm going to put a little bit of a primer on your eyelid and i'm gonna go with some

912
01:55:33,520 --> 01:55:46,880
eye shadow yeah yeah i totally feel that um and that's another reason why i i'm very self-conscious

913
01:55:46,880 --> 01:55:55,600
about my skin so that's why i don't know what anybody see me no man will perceive me or gaze upon me

914
01:55:56,400 --> 01:56:00,800
i'm an idiot no he doesn't see me but like no i'm a woman i have womanly thoughts

915
01:56:01,040 --> 01:56:04,560

948
02:00:51,280 --> 02:00:55,440

950
02:01:22,240 --> 02:01:23,040

951
02:01:30,320 --> 02:01:31,440

952
02:01:41,200 --> 02:01:42,960

954
02:01:51,520 --> 02:01:52,240
and

955
02:01:54,560 --> 02:01:55,600

956
02:02:18,400 --> 02:02:19,680
okay it's a brush

957
02:02:21,280 --> 02:02:27,280
Where's my blending brush? I need a blending brush.

958
02:02:28,280 --> 02:02:37,280
Yeah, so I'm just gonna blend, blend, blend, blend, blend, blend...

959
02:02:38,280 --> 02:02:42,280
Cos you don't want it to clump in one spot, we don't want it to clump in one spot.

960
02:02:46,280 --> 02:02:49,280
Perfect! Perfect, perfect, perfect.

961
02:02:49,280 --> 02:02:54,280
Okay, it looks really cute.

962
02:02:54,280 --> 02:02:59,280
So I put the base down, so I'm just gonna go in with another brush.

963
02:02:59,280 --> 02:03:01,280
Cause I don't want to use the same brush.

964
02:03:01,280 --> 02:03:03,280
I really keep my brushes separate.

965
02:03:03,280 --> 02:03:06,280
I have a lot of different types of brushes.

966
02:03:06,280 --> 02:03:10,280
Usually girls don't always use the same brush.

967
02:03:10,280 --> 02:03:13,280
We use lots of different type of brushes.

968
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:16,280
Oh, is there a peelio on this one?

969
02:03:16,280 --> 02:03:20,280
Oh, the ones I never took the peelio off of this.

970
02:03:20,280 --> 02:03:23,280
Right here, there's a really nice peelio.

971
02:03:26,280 --> 02:03:28,280
Oh, that was great.

972
02:03:28,280 --> 02:03:29,280
Wow, this is...

973
02:03:29,280 --> 02:03:31,280
Ooh, that looks good.

974
02:03:31,280 --> 02:03:33,280
Oh, there's a peelio in the mirror.

975
02:03:33,280 --> 02:03:34,280
Wow, that looks so cute.

976
02:03:34,280 --> 02:03:36,280
Oh my god, why do I look so cute?

977
02:03:36,280 --> 02:03:37,280
What the hell?

978
02:03:37,280 --> 02:03:40,280
Okay, sorry to get distracted about how cute I am.

979
02:03:41,280 --> 02:03:42,280
Okay.

980
02:03:45,280 --> 02:03:46,280
I'm playing and...

981
02:03:46,280 --> 02:03:48,280
I need to put on some chapstick.

982
02:03:48,280 --> 02:03:49,280
Oh.

983
02:03:52,280 --> 02:03:53,280
Okay, I'll put on some chapstick later.

984
02:03:53,280 --> 02:03:55,280
I'm still looking at my lips for now.

985
02:03:57,280 --> 02:03:58,280
Okay.

986
02:03:59,280 --> 02:04:01,280
Let me get some more.

987
02:04:03,280 --> 02:04:04,280
Okay, I got some more.

988
02:04:04,280 --> 02:04:07,280
So I'm gonna brush easy peasy over your lid.

989
02:04:08,280 --> 02:04:10,280
Um, put on some...

990
02:04:12,280 --> 02:04:14,280
Just a little bit.

991
02:04:14,280 --> 02:04:15,280
Just a little bit.

992
02:04:25,280 --> 02:04:26,280
Sorry.

993
02:04:27,280 --> 02:04:28,280
Don't move.

994
02:04:28,280 --> 02:04:30,280
Close your eyes.

995
02:04:30,280 --> 02:04:32,280
Close, close, close, close, close.

996
02:04:32,280 --> 02:04:36,280
You better be close, close, close, close, close, close, close, close, close.

997
02:04:36,280 --> 02:04:39,280
Are they closed? Are they closed?

998
02:04:39,280 --> 02:04:40,280
Go ahead

999
02:04:49,280 --> 02:04:50,280
Done

1000
02:04:51,280 --> 02:04:52,280
Cool

1001
02:04:53,280 --> 02:04:54,280
Okay, that looks good

1002
02:04:54,280 --> 02:04:55,280
That looks so cute

1003
02:04:55,280 --> 02:04:56,280
Oh my god, okay

1004
02:04:56,280 --> 02:05:01,280
I'm gonna go in with a little bit of Tuscany Gone

1005
02:05:01,280 --> 02:05:03,280
and that's what I'm gonna mix

1006
02:05:03,280 --> 02:05:07,280
I'm just gonna do outside corners of the eyes

1007
02:05:07,280 --> 02:05:09,280
A little bit of smoke

1008
02:05:09,280 --> 02:05:11,280
Just a little bit of smoke

1009
02:05:12,280 --> 02:05:14,280
A little bit of smoke

1010
02:05:23,280 --> 02:05:24,280
Okay, perfect

1011
02:05:24,280 --> 02:05:28,280
Okay, now that we've got the eyeshadow

1012
02:05:28,280 --> 02:05:30,280
Usually you want to do eyeshadow before you do eyeliner

1013
02:05:30,280 --> 02:05:34,280
Otherwise, you're just gonna go over your eyeliner and that's it

1014
02:05:34,280 --> 02:05:36,280
So I got...

1015
02:05:36,280 --> 02:05:38,280
I don't know what you just...

1016
02:05:43,280 --> 02:05:45,280
Okay, got the eyeliner

1017
02:05:45,280 --> 02:05:47,280
So this is a pencil liner

1018
02:05:49,280 --> 02:05:52,280
Actually, it's like a marker, you know what I'm talking about?

1019
02:05:53,280 --> 02:06:00,280
So, usually, I personally don't like pencil liners

1020
02:06:00,280 --> 02:06:02,280
I prefer liquid liners

1021
02:06:02,280 --> 02:06:04,280
but everybody is different

1022
02:06:04,280 --> 02:06:09,280
So, what type of eyeliner do you want?

1023
02:06:09,280 --> 02:06:10,280
Do you want like a little wing?

1024
02:06:10,280 --> 02:06:12,280
Do you want like a big cat eye?

1025
02:06:13,280 --> 02:06:16,280
I can do like a little bit

1026
02:06:16,280 --> 02:06:18,280
like little wings on the other

1027
02:06:18,280 --> 02:06:20,280
and like mine

1028
02:06:26,280 --> 02:06:27,280
Do you want to like mine?

1029
02:06:27,280 --> 02:06:31,280
Because I have pretty good eyeliner on my eye

1030
02:06:31,280 --> 02:06:33,280
My eyeliner is one for you

1031
02:06:33,280 --> 02:06:35,280
as a kid, so...

1032
02:06:37,280 --> 02:06:38,280
You want like me?

1033
02:06:38,280 --> 02:06:40,280
Okay, I'll do like me

1034
02:06:44,280 --> 02:06:45,280
You have to...

1035
02:06:45,280 --> 02:06:46,280
You can't move

1036
02:06:47,280 --> 02:06:49,280
In fact, I need a whole new one

1037
02:06:50,280 --> 02:06:52,280
I need to shake this up

1038
02:06:52,280 --> 02:06:56,280
So I'm using NYX Professional Epic Ink Liner

1039
02:06:56,280 --> 02:06:58,280
That's the one I use a lot of proof

1040
02:06:58,280 --> 02:07:00,280
And it is pretty good

1041
02:07:00,280 --> 02:07:02,280
I'm gonna shake it up a little bit

1042
02:07:03,280 --> 02:07:05,280
Okay, one of those

1043
02:07:17,280 --> 02:07:19,280
I'm just going to...

1044
02:07:19,280 --> 02:07:21,280
Hold me up, like hold you

1045
02:07:24,280 --> 02:07:29,280
Okay, so I'm just a little wing

1046
02:07:33,280 --> 02:07:34,280
Close your eyes

1047
02:07:34,280 --> 02:07:37,280
Close, close, close, close, close, close, close

1048
02:07:41,280 --> 02:07:42,280
Hold on, close, keep your eye

1049
02:07:42,280 --> 02:07:43,280
Can you like...

1050
02:07:43,280 --> 02:07:45,280
Yeah, just like, yeah, like that, thank you

1051
02:07:45,280 --> 02:07:47,280
I'm just gonna fill it in a little bit

1052
02:07:47,280 --> 02:07:48,280
I don't really kind of miss a spot

1053
02:07:48,280 --> 02:07:49,280
Okay, perfect

1054
02:07:50,280 --> 02:07:52,280
Okay, let me do the other eye

1055
02:07:57,280 --> 02:07:58,280
Other eye

1056
02:08:01,280 --> 02:08:02,280
Just gonna go in

1057
02:08:03,280 --> 02:08:05,280
Close, close, close, close, close

1058
02:08:05,280 --> 02:08:06,280
Holding you down

1059
02:08:08,280 --> 02:08:10,280
Perfect, and done

1060
02:08:11,280 --> 02:08:13,280
Nice, okay

1061
02:08:13,280 --> 02:08:15,280
I thought you were gonna move

1062
02:08:15,280 --> 02:08:18,280
And make me go across your face

1063
02:08:18,280 --> 02:08:20,280
So I'm happy that didn't work out

1064
02:08:20,280 --> 02:08:22,280
That made that work out

1065
02:08:22,280 --> 02:08:23,280
Let me...

1066
02:08:24,280 --> 02:08:28,280
So now, what I'm gonna do

1067
02:08:29,280 --> 02:08:32,280
I'm gonna get some mascara

1068
02:08:32,280 --> 02:08:33,280
Yep, don't you worry

1069
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:36,280
So for mascara, my true...

1070
02:08:37,280 --> 02:08:38,280
Why don't I...

1071
02:08:38,280 --> 02:08:39,280
Oh, I got the brush

1072
02:08:43,280 --> 02:08:47,280
The mascara I've used for years

1073
02:08:47,280 --> 02:08:50,280
Is roller lash by Benefit

1074
02:08:50,280 --> 02:08:51,280
It's my favorite

1075
02:08:55,280 --> 02:08:57,280
Hold on, let me get the mascara out

1076
02:09:00,280 --> 02:09:01,280
There we go

1077
02:09:13,280 --> 02:09:30,280
Sometimes I'll put it on my top and bottom lash

1078
02:09:30,280 --> 02:09:32,280
But really, I've been just doing my top lash

1079
02:09:32,280 --> 02:09:34,280
I have naturally super long eyelashes

1080
02:09:34,280 --> 02:09:36,280
So I usually get asked if I wear falsies

1081
02:09:36,280 --> 02:09:38,280
When I use this mascara

1082
02:09:38,280 --> 02:09:39,280
I don't use falsies

1083
02:09:39,280 --> 02:09:42,280
I just have natural and curling and long eyelashes

1084
02:09:42,280 --> 02:09:44,280
Thank you, genetics

1085
02:09:44,280 --> 02:09:49,280
Okay, this is gonna be very hard

1086
02:09:49,280 --> 02:09:57,280
Because you have to look up

1087
02:09:58,280 --> 02:10:00,280
So you have to look up

1088
02:10:04,280 --> 02:10:05,280
So look up

1089
02:10:06,280 --> 02:10:10,280
And I'm just gonna wipe this under your eye, okay?

1090
02:10:10,280 --> 02:10:13,280
So, please, you...

1091
02:10:14,280 --> 02:10:15,280
Ready?

1092
02:10:16,280 --> 02:10:17,280
Which one do you want me to do?

1093
02:10:18,280 --> 02:10:20,280
Which one do you want me to do?

1094
02:10:23,280 --> 02:10:25,280
Which one do you want me to start with?

1095
02:10:26,280 --> 02:10:28,280
My left eye? Your left eye?

1096
02:10:28,280 --> 02:10:29,280
Okay

1097
02:10:32,280 --> 02:10:34,280
My left or your left?

1098
02:10:37,280 --> 02:10:38,280
Ready?

1099
02:10:38,280 --> 02:10:39,280
Look up

1100
02:10:40,280 --> 02:10:41,280
Oh

1101
02:10:43,280 --> 02:10:44,280
You moved

1102
02:10:44,280 --> 02:10:45,280
Why did you move?

1103
02:10:45,280 --> 02:10:47,280
I just poked you in the eye

1104
02:10:48,280 --> 02:10:50,280
And you have mascara on your nose now

1105
02:10:53,280 --> 02:10:56,280
God, sweetie, why did you move?

1106
02:10:58,280 --> 02:10:59,280
Okay, hold on

1107
02:10:59,280 --> 02:11:00,280
Let me wipe it

1108
02:11:00,280 --> 02:11:01,280
Let me wipe it

1109
02:11:01,280 --> 02:11:02,280
Look up, look up

1110
02:11:02,280 --> 02:11:03,280
Do you like that?

1111
02:11:03,280 --> 02:11:04,280
It's okay

1112
02:11:05,280 --> 02:11:08,280
I'm gonna get a little bit of cleanser

1113
02:11:08,280 --> 02:11:10,280
And then I'm just gonna wipe it

1114
02:11:11,280 --> 02:11:13,280
I told you not to move

1115
02:11:17,280 --> 02:11:19,280
Okay, you're fine

1116
02:11:19,280 --> 02:11:21,280
Okay, let's try this again

1117
02:11:21,280 --> 02:11:22,280
Let's try this again

1118
02:11:22,280 --> 02:11:23,280
You'll be okay

1119
02:11:26,280 --> 02:11:27,280
Okay

1120
02:11:27,280 --> 02:11:29,280
I'm gonna do the other eye this time, okay?

1121
02:11:29,280 --> 02:11:32,280
So look up and just don't move

1122
02:11:32,280 --> 02:11:36,280
And then as I'm moving my hand

1123
02:11:36,280 --> 02:11:38,280
You can slowly blink, okay?

1124
02:11:38,280 --> 02:11:39,280
Ready?

1125
02:11:39,280 --> 02:11:40,280
Like this

1126
02:11:40,280 --> 02:11:41,280
Watch, watch me, watch me

1127
02:11:41,280 --> 02:11:42,280
Watch me

1128
02:11:49,280 --> 02:11:50,280
So I'm gonna look up

1129
02:11:54,280 --> 02:11:55,280
Look up

1130
02:11:59,280 --> 02:12:00,280
You got it?

1131
02:12:01,280 --> 02:12:03,280
What if you're blind and cancel or I'm looking?

1132
02:12:03,280 --> 02:12:04,280
How are you typing?

1133
02:12:04,280 --> 02:12:05,280
I'm very impressed

1134
02:12:06,280 --> 02:12:09,280
Okay, perfect

1135
02:12:36,280 --> 02:12:37,280
Okay

1136
02:12:45,280 --> 02:12:47,280
Good, good, that worked

1137
02:12:47,280 --> 02:12:49,280
Next one, next one, good job

1138
02:12:49,280 --> 02:12:50,280
Okay

1139
02:13:05,280 --> 02:13:07,280
Nice, good job

1140
02:13:08,280 --> 02:13:10,280
Nice job, nice job, perfect

1141
02:13:12,280 --> 02:13:15,280
Oh, my mouth is open

1142
02:13:20,280 --> 02:13:21,280
So

1143
02:13:22,280 --> 02:13:23,280
Now you did that

1144
02:13:24,280 --> 02:13:25,280
Nice job

1145
02:13:26,280 --> 02:13:29,280
I think I'm gonna add some blush on you now

1146
02:13:29,280 --> 02:13:31,280
So let me get

1147
02:13:34,280 --> 02:13:36,280
Nope, hold on, let me find the right one

1148
02:13:37,280 --> 02:13:38,280
Got it

1149
02:13:39,280 --> 02:13:40,280
Alright, hold on

1150
02:13:41,280 --> 02:13:42,280
Let me close it

1151
02:13:50,280 --> 02:13:51,280
Okay

1152
02:14:08,280 --> 02:14:11,280
Oh, sorry, I had to go somewhere

1153
02:14:19,280 --> 02:14:20,280
Okay

1154
02:14:24,280 --> 02:14:25,280
Don't look at my boobs

1155
02:14:25,280 --> 02:14:26,280
That's weird

1156
02:14:26,280 --> 02:14:27,280
I'm your sister

1157
02:14:28,280 --> 02:14:29,280
Kind of awkward

1158
02:14:30,280 --> 02:14:31,280
Okay

1159
02:14:31,280 --> 02:14:32,280
Cool, cool, cool

1160
02:14:32,280 --> 02:14:34,280
Alright, I think that's good

1161
02:14:35,280 --> 02:14:37,280
Oops, what am I pressing on?

1162
02:14:41,280 --> 02:14:42,280
Alright

1163
02:14:43,280 --> 02:14:44,280
Don't

1164
02:14:44,280 --> 02:14:46,280
Stop looking at my boobs

1165
02:14:50,280 --> 02:14:52,280
Alright, let me use

1166
02:15:05,280 --> 02:15:07,280
Why are you just

1167
02:15:07,280 --> 02:15:09,280
Why are you just staring?

1168
02:15:10,280 --> 02:15:12,280
Can you please stop?

1169
02:15:13,280 --> 02:15:15,280
That's very appropriate

1170
02:15:15,280 --> 02:15:16,280
Okay

1171
02:15:19,280 --> 02:15:20,280
My god

1172
02:15:21,280 --> 02:15:22,280
Alright

1173
02:15:22,280 --> 02:15:24,280
So you got your blush

1174
02:15:24,280 --> 02:15:27,280
Okay, I think we need to give you a nice whip

1175
02:15:28,280 --> 02:15:29,280
Like

1176
02:15:29,280 --> 02:15:31,280
A little whip, a little

1177
02:15:31,280 --> 02:15:33,280
A little whippy whip

1178
02:15:33,280 --> 02:15:34,280
A little, oh

1179
02:15:38,280 --> 02:15:39,280
Sorry

1180
02:15:39,280 --> 02:15:41,280
Alright, come here, come here, come here

1181
02:15:41,280 --> 02:15:42,280
I need it

1182
02:15:43,280 --> 02:15:44,280
Alright

1183
02:15:45,280 --> 02:15:47,280
I need a problem

1184
02:15:47,280 --> 02:15:48,280
Lipstick

1185
02:15:51,280 --> 02:15:53,280
I can find the lipstick

1186
02:15:53,280 --> 02:15:55,280
Sometimes these towels don't work

1187
02:15:55,280 --> 02:15:56,280
Oh, found it

1188
02:15:58,280 --> 02:15:59,280
The lipstick hasn't found

1189
02:15:59,280 --> 02:16:00,280
Alright

1190
02:16:02,280 --> 02:16:03,280
Using

1191
02:16:04,280 --> 02:16:05,280
I think that's nice

1192
02:16:12,280 --> 02:16:13,280
Mm-hmm

1193
02:16:17,280 --> 02:16:19,280
So before, actually, I put lipstick on you

1194
02:16:19,280 --> 02:16:21,280
I'm gonna put on some chapstick on you

1195
02:16:22,280 --> 02:16:23,280
Because I'm gonna

1196
02:16:23,280 --> 02:16:25,280
Hydrate those lips

1197
02:16:30,280 --> 02:16:32,280
Can you push your lips like this?

1198
02:16:32,280 --> 02:16:34,280
Well, push your lips

1199
02:16:34,280 --> 02:16:35,280
Like that

1200
02:16:36,280 --> 02:16:37,280
Please

1201
02:16:38,280 --> 02:16:39,280
Please, please, please

1202
02:16:39,280 --> 02:16:40,280
Can you

1203
02:16:40,280 --> 02:16:41,280
Can you give me a kiss?

1204
02:16:41,280 --> 02:16:42,280
I know you like to

1205
02:16:42,280 --> 02:16:43,280
You wanna give me a kiss

1206
02:16:58,280 --> 02:16:59,280
Okay, perfect

1207
02:16:59,280 --> 02:17:00,280
Okay

1208
02:17:00,280 --> 02:17:01,280
Let's first

1209
02:17:09,280 --> 02:17:10,280
Okay

1210
02:17:10,280 --> 02:17:13,280
Now I'm gonna put my lip on your chapstick

1211
02:17:13,280 --> 02:17:15,280
I'm gonna put on

1212
02:17:15,280 --> 02:17:17,280
The lipstick

1213
02:17:17,280 --> 02:17:18,280
So

1214
02:17:19,280 --> 02:17:20,280
First

1215
02:17:21,280 --> 02:17:22,280
Right now

1216
02:17:22,280 --> 02:17:23,280
Okay

1217
02:17:23,280 --> 02:17:24,280
Mm-hmm

1218
02:17:24,280 --> 02:17:26,280
Mm-hmm

1219
02:17:30,280 --> 02:17:31,280
Okay

1220
02:17:44,280 --> 02:17:45,280
Perfect

1221
02:17:45,280 --> 02:17:46,280
You smack your lips there like this

1222
02:17:46,280 --> 02:17:47,280
Mm-hmm

1223
02:17:47,280 --> 02:17:48,280
Mm-hmm

1224
02:17:48,280 --> 02:17:50,280
Mm-hmm

1225
02:17:50,280 --> 02:17:51,280
Mm-hmm

1226
02:18:00,280 --> 02:18:01,280
Okay

1227
02:18:03,280 --> 02:18:04,280
Have a kiss

1228
02:18:05,280 --> 02:18:07,280
Come on, you wanna give me a kiss

1229
02:18:08,280 --> 02:18:09,280
Come on, Ricky

1230
02:18:09,280 --> 02:18:10,280
Give me a kiss on the tree

1231
02:18:13,280 --> 02:18:14,280
Right there

1232
02:18:14,280 --> 02:18:15,280
Give me a kiss on the tree

1233
02:18:22,280 --> 02:18:24,280
Aw, I see that wasn't so hard

1234
02:18:24,280 --> 02:18:26,280
Good job

1235
02:18:27,280 --> 02:18:28,280
Nice

1236
02:18:29,280 --> 02:18:30,280
Nice

1237
02:18:31,280 --> 02:18:33,280
My hand is small

1238
02:18:40,280 --> 02:18:42,280
Sorry, let me back up

1239
02:18:42,280 --> 02:18:43,280
Nope

1240
02:18:43,280 --> 02:18:44,280
Um

1241
02:18:44,280 --> 02:18:45,280
Don't look at that

1242
02:18:47,280 --> 02:18:48,280
Nope

1243
02:18:50,280 --> 02:18:52,280
I'm tilting myself

1244
02:18:53,280 --> 02:18:54,280
Uh

1245
02:18:59,280 --> 02:19:00,280
Uh

1246
02:19:03,280 --> 02:19:05,280
Don't worry about it

1247
02:19:08,280 --> 02:19:09,280
Um, okay

1248
02:19:09,280 --> 02:19:12,280
So now I'm gonna set your makeup with the setting spray

1249
02:19:12,280 --> 02:19:15,280
Just another layer to lock it all in

1250
02:19:15,280 --> 02:19:18,280
Lock it, lock it, lock it, lock it, lock it in

1251
02:19:18,280 --> 02:19:20,280
Lock it in, lock it in, lock it in

1252
02:19:22,280 --> 02:19:24,280
Yes, I'm wearing good at cartwheels

1253
02:19:24,280 --> 02:19:26,280
Lock, lock it, lock it

1254
02:19:26,280 --> 02:19:28,280
Pop, lock and drop it

1255
02:19:28,280 --> 02:19:29,280
Lock it

1256
02:19:31,280 --> 02:19:34,280
Okay, so I like to use

1257
02:19:40,280 --> 02:19:42,280
The collier

1258
02:19:42,280 --> 02:19:45,280
Oh, debouté beauty mixer

1259
02:19:45,280 --> 02:19:47,280
As a setting spray

1260
02:19:47,280 --> 02:19:48,280
It's also good just for like

1261
02:19:48,280 --> 02:19:49,280
Just to spray on your face

1262
02:19:49,280 --> 02:19:51,280
Just to kind of re-energize it

1263
02:19:51,280 --> 02:19:56,280
Sorry, I'm just shaking it up

1264
02:19:56,280 --> 02:19:58,280
Because the product is all separated

1265
02:20:00,280 --> 02:20:01,280
Okay

1266
02:20:01,280 --> 02:20:03,280
So let me just

1267
02:20:11,280 --> 02:20:12,280
Nice

1268
02:20:13,280 --> 02:20:15,280
It also smells good

1269
02:20:15,280 --> 02:20:16,280
What's in it?

1270
02:20:16,280 --> 02:20:17,280
Um

1271
02:20:20,280 --> 02:20:22,280
It's too small, I honestly can't read that

1272
02:20:22,280 --> 02:20:23,280
It's also dark

1273
02:20:25,280 --> 02:20:27,280
What is this font?

1274
02:20:28,280 --> 02:20:29,280
Water

1275
02:20:29,280 --> 02:20:31,280
Citrus

1276
02:20:32,280 --> 02:20:35,280
Something in Latin

1277
02:20:41,280 --> 02:20:44,280
Rosemary, leaf oil, potassium

1278
02:20:44,280 --> 02:20:46,280
I can't tell

1279
02:20:47,280 --> 02:20:50,280
And you don't want to touch your face for that?

1280
02:20:51,280 --> 02:20:52,280
Um, alright

1281
02:20:52,280 --> 02:20:54,280
You know what it should have done?

1282
02:20:54,280 --> 02:20:55,280
I should have contoured

1283
02:20:55,280 --> 02:20:56,280
But it's fine

1284
02:20:56,280 --> 02:20:58,280
You don't really need contour

1285
02:20:58,280 --> 02:21:00,280
I don't like contour

1286
02:21:00,280 --> 02:21:01,280
You don't need contour

1287
02:21:02,280 --> 02:21:03,280
Alright

1288
02:21:04,280 --> 02:21:05,280
What do you think?

1289
02:21:06,280 --> 02:21:08,280
Take a look, here

1290
02:21:08,280 --> 02:21:10,280
I'm handing you the compact

1291
02:21:10,280 --> 02:21:11,280
What do you think?

1292
02:21:11,280 --> 02:21:13,280
I'm handing you the compact

1293
02:21:13,280 --> 02:21:14,280
What do you think?

1294
02:21:36,280 --> 02:21:38,280
I think you look really lovely

1295
02:21:41,280 --> 02:21:42,280
Yeah, hold on, let me get out of the way

1296
02:21:42,280 --> 02:21:44,280
Let me let me let you look in the mirror

1297
02:21:44,280 --> 02:21:46,280
Let me let you look in the mirror

1298
02:21:47,280 --> 02:21:49,280
Why don't you walk over to the mirror

1299
02:21:58,280 --> 02:22:01,280
Wow, you look so good

1300
02:22:03,280 --> 02:22:05,280
You look so amazing

1301
02:22:05,280 --> 02:22:10,280
Wow, I

1302
02:22:13,280 --> 02:22:16,280
You look so good in the mirror right now

1303
02:22:17,280 --> 02:22:18,280
Are you mewing?

1304
02:22:18,280 --> 02:22:20,280
Have you been mewing lately?

1305
02:22:25,280 --> 02:22:26,280
You're mocking everybody

1306
02:22:26,280 --> 02:22:27,280
You look like a model

1307
02:22:28,280 --> 02:22:30,280
Have you ever considered becoming a model?

1308
02:22:32,280 --> 02:22:33,280
Your eyebrows are on fleek

1309
02:22:33,280 --> 02:22:35,280
It gave you that good arch

1310
02:22:35,280 --> 02:22:37,280
Bust your hair out so you look nice

1311
02:22:37,280 --> 02:22:39,280
You're perching your lips

1312
02:22:40,280 --> 02:22:42,280
You look really good

1313
02:22:44,280 --> 02:22:45,280
You got really nice lips

1314
02:22:45,280 --> 02:22:47,280
I don't even have to contour your nose or anything

1315
02:22:47,280 --> 02:22:49,280
You can see a little bit of a shadow

1316
02:22:49,280 --> 02:22:51,280
I kept it nice and light

1317
02:22:52,280 --> 02:22:54,280
And it really goes with your outfit

1318
02:22:58,280 --> 02:22:59,280
Wow

1319
02:22:59,280 --> 02:23:01,280
Come back come back here

1320
02:23:01,280 --> 02:23:02,280
Come back over

1321
02:23:03,280 --> 02:23:04,280
Nice, nice

1322
02:23:04,280 --> 02:23:06,280
I think I did a good job

1323
02:23:06,280 --> 02:23:07,280
What do you guys think?

1324
02:23:15,280 --> 02:23:16,280
Wonderful features

1325
02:23:17,280 --> 02:23:19,280
I don't know why you don't have everybody

1326
02:23:19,280 --> 02:23:21,280
Boys and girls, you know

1327
02:23:21,280 --> 02:23:23,280
Blasting after you

1328
02:23:24,280 --> 02:23:26,280
You look gorgeous

1329
02:23:32,280 --> 02:23:34,280
Now you can get everyone

1330
02:23:34,280 --> 02:23:38,280
You can pull any fit bird that your heart desires

1331
02:23:43,280 --> 02:23:44,280
Wait, you have a crush on somebody?

1332
02:23:44,280 --> 02:23:45,280
There's a girl that you like

1333
02:23:45,280 --> 02:23:47,280
Tell me, who's the girl?

1334
02:23:47,280 --> 02:23:49,280
Who's the girl that you like?

1335
02:23:50,280 --> 02:23:52,280
I hope they treat you right

1336
02:23:52,280 --> 02:23:54,280
Otherwise we're going to have problems

1337
02:23:54,280 --> 02:23:56,280
I don't want to have to

1338
02:23:57,280 --> 02:23:59,280
Have to take care of anybody

1339
02:24:00,280 --> 02:24:01,280
It's me?

1340
02:24:14,280 --> 02:24:16,280
That's really sweet and all

1341
02:24:17,280 --> 02:24:18,280
But um

1342
02:24:23,280 --> 02:24:25,280
I'm your sister

1343
02:24:26,280 --> 02:24:27,280
Well

1344
02:24:27,280 --> 02:24:30,280
I do admit that it's very sweet

1345
02:24:30,280 --> 02:24:33,280
That you admitted to me being your crush

1346
02:24:33,280 --> 02:24:35,280
You know it's kind of wholesome in a way

1347
02:24:35,280 --> 02:24:37,280
I'll give you a little smooch for that

1348
02:24:40,280 --> 02:24:42,280
You look really good

1349
02:24:45,280 --> 02:24:47,280
Good luck getting that all off

1350
02:24:47,280 --> 02:24:49,280
I actually tattooed it to your face

1351
02:24:49,280 --> 02:24:51,280
So I guess you're permanently gorgeous

1352
02:24:55,280 --> 02:24:57,280
So

1353
02:25:06,280 --> 02:25:08,280
The plot twist of the century

1354
02:25:10,280 --> 02:25:12,280
Yeah, it's permanent

1355
02:25:13,280 --> 02:25:14,280
It's permanent

1356
02:25:15,280 --> 02:25:17,280
Hold on, I have an idea

1357
02:25:19,280 --> 02:25:21,280
Hold on, I have an idea

1358
02:25:21,280 --> 02:25:23,280
Nobody move

1359
02:25:23,280 --> 02:25:25,280
Nobody do anything

1360
02:25:25,280 --> 02:25:27,280
Frick

1361
02:25:27,280 --> 02:25:29,280
Where is it?

1362
02:25:32,280 --> 02:25:34,280
Where is it?

1363
02:25:45,280 --> 02:25:47,280
Where is it?

1364
02:25:47,280 --> 02:25:49,280
Where is it?

1365
02:25:54,280 --> 02:25:57,280
Oh, I found it

1366
02:25:59,280 --> 02:26:01,280
Hold on, hold on, hold on

1367
02:26:04,280 --> 02:26:06,280
Please hold, please hold

1368
02:26:06,280 --> 02:26:08,280
Please hold

1369
02:26:08,280 --> 02:26:10,280
Please hold

1370
02:26:12,280 --> 02:26:14,280
Please hold

1371
02:26:24,280 --> 02:26:26,280
I kind of wish I found this earlier

1372
02:26:26,280 --> 02:26:28,280
Because that would be funny if I just had this already

1373
02:26:45,280 --> 02:26:47,280
Wow

1374
02:26:47,280 --> 02:26:49,280
Oh

1375
02:26:49,280 --> 02:26:51,280
Uh

1376
02:26:54,280 --> 02:26:56,280
Uh

1377
02:27:01,280 --> 02:27:03,280
Where are the toggles on this?

1378
02:27:04,280 --> 02:27:06,280
Are there any toggles?

1379
02:27:11,280 --> 02:27:13,280
I don't think there is

1380
02:27:15,280 --> 02:27:17,280
Hold on, let me throw this away real quick

1381
02:27:23,280 --> 02:27:25,280
Hold on

1382
02:27:28,280 --> 02:27:30,280
And I'm not giving myself a base chat

1383
02:27:36,280 --> 02:27:38,280
Sorry, it was going under my clothes

1384
02:27:41,280 --> 02:27:43,280
There's like something you can do

1385
02:27:43,280 --> 02:27:45,280
There's like more you can do

1386
02:27:48,280 --> 02:27:50,280
I don't know why the toggles aren't working

1387
02:27:50,280 --> 02:27:52,280
Is it over here?

1388
02:27:53,280 --> 02:27:55,280
Nope

1389
02:27:58,280 --> 02:28:01,280
What if I, what if I, let me go into the file

1390
02:28:12,280 --> 02:28:14,280
I look like I'm getting tattooed

1391
02:28:16,280 --> 02:28:18,280
No, it isn't supposed to be like this

1392
02:28:19,280 --> 02:28:21,280
I'm the one who tattooed

1393
02:28:21,280 --> 02:28:23,280
Let me give myself a cool face chat

1394
02:28:24,280 --> 02:28:26,280
Let me give myself a beard

1395
02:28:27,280 --> 02:28:29,280
That would be a fun ASMR stream

1396
02:28:29,280 --> 02:28:31,280
You're tattooing me

1397
02:28:31,280 --> 02:28:33,280
And I'm like an annoying client

1398
02:28:35,280 --> 02:28:37,280
There's a way that I can like tattoo

1399
02:28:37,280 --> 02:28:39,280
Oh, she on my chest

1400
02:28:39,280 --> 02:28:41,280
So I can't figure out how to do it

1401
02:28:41,280 --> 02:28:43,280
Hold on, let me see

1402
02:28:52,280 --> 02:28:54,280
What if I load

1403
02:28:57,280 --> 02:28:59,280
What are the hotkeys for this?

1404
02:28:59,280 --> 02:29:01,280
I wish I would let you see the hotkeys

1405
02:29:09,280 --> 02:29:11,280
What's it called?

1406
02:29:11,280 --> 02:29:14,280
The live 2D assets you load in

1407
02:29:16,280 --> 02:29:19,280
Alt F4, do you think I'm an idiot bro?

1408
02:29:19,280 --> 02:29:21,280
Ow, I just like hurt my nose

1409
02:29:23,280 --> 02:29:25,280
Yeah, you're being welded

1410
02:29:27,280 --> 02:29:29,280
I'm tattooing some makeup on my face

1411
02:29:30,280 --> 02:29:32,280
There are people who actually, what is happening

1412
02:29:32,280 --> 02:29:34,280
There are people that tattoo stuff

1413
02:29:39,280 --> 02:29:42,280
What if I just go through all the letters

1414
02:29:43,280 --> 02:29:45,280
I will find these toggles

1415
02:29:45,280 --> 02:29:47,280
As if it's the last thing I do

1416
02:29:57,280 --> 02:29:59,280
Okay, they don't want to work

1417
02:29:59,280 --> 02:30:01,280
Maybe I loaded it in wrong

1418
02:30:01,280 --> 02:30:03,280
What if I load this as a model

1419
02:30:04,280 --> 02:30:06,280
No, that wouldn't make any sense

1420
02:30:06,280 --> 02:30:08,280
Did I put this on the wrong folder?

1421
02:30:12,280 --> 02:30:14,280
Oh, if you haven't noticed, it's the end of the ASMR

1422
02:30:30,280 --> 02:30:32,280
Demos

1423
02:30:33,280 --> 02:30:37,280
I can have Drake or no regrets

1424
02:30:37,280 --> 02:30:39,280
tattooed on me

1425
02:30:40,280 --> 02:30:42,280
So I can't figure out how to do it

1426
02:30:45,280 --> 02:30:47,280
Customize

1427
02:30:48,280 --> 02:30:51,280
Kevin makes such great assets

1428
02:30:59,280 --> 02:31:01,280
I wish I would

1429
02:31:03,280 --> 02:31:05,280
It's like not showing, whatever I give up

1430
02:31:05,280 --> 02:31:08,280
But you get the idea, you get the meme, you get the joke

1431
02:31:10,280 --> 02:31:13,280
Property of Madame Sheevee in my bag

1432
02:31:14,280 --> 02:31:16,280
Yeah, it was better, it was better

1433
02:31:17,280 --> 02:31:20,280
I would give you a tramp stamp that says

1434
02:31:20,280 --> 02:31:22,280
Omega

1435
02:31:22,280 --> 02:31:24,280
And I'll get one on my front

1436
02:31:25,280 --> 02:31:27,280
Where a boom tattoo that says Alpha

1437
02:31:28,280 --> 02:31:30,280
Never mind

1438
02:31:30,280 --> 02:31:32,280
I'm on YouTube

1439
02:31:40,280 --> 02:31:43,280
Did you guys like the ASMR?

1440
02:31:45,280 --> 02:31:47,280
Did you like it?

1441
02:31:47,280 --> 02:31:49,280
Did you like the ASMR?

1442
02:31:50,280 --> 02:31:52,280
Did you like my AC ambiance?

1443
02:31:53,280 --> 02:31:55,280
Did you like my outfit?

1444
02:32:06,280 --> 02:32:08,280
I realize I'm very thick

1445
02:32:09,280 --> 02:32:12,280
No, ignore that my outfit is over my normal outfit

1446
02:32:14,280 --> 02:32:16,280
What happens if I

1447
02:32:35,280 --> 02:32:38,280
Let me just go back down

1448
02:32:39,280 --> 02:32:41,280
No

1449
02:32:45,280 --> 02:32:47,280
I like that my neck stayed in place

1450
02:32:50,280 --> 02:32:52,280
That's because

1451
02:32:52,280 --> 02:32:55,280
I usually load in my head as a model

1452
02:32:55,280 --> 02:32:57,280
But this time

1453
02:32:58,280 --> 02:33:00,280
I just

1454
02:33:01,280 --> 02:33:05,280
Loaded in my normal self and just made my top transparent

1455
02:33:09,280 --> 02:33:11,280
I

1456
02:33:16,280 --> 02:33:18,280
Normally

1457
02:33:20,280 --> 02:33:23,280
I just do this and I slap that on

1458
02:33:28,280 --> 02:33:30,280
Hey look, it's me and the

1459
02:33:30,280 --> 02:33:32,280
It's me and Bethany

1460
02:33:32,280 --> 02:33:34,280
Hello

1461
02:33:34,280 --> 02:33:36,280
Hi

1462
02:33:36,280 --> 02:33:40,280
She looks like a little parrot I can put on my shoulders

1463
02:33:41,280 --> 02:33:43,280
Shebethany?

1464
02:33:44,280 --> 02:33:46,280
Sorry, I threw Shebethany away

1465
02:33:52,280 --> 02:33:55,280
Erm, what's the shibbity?

1466
02:33:55,280 --> 02:33:57,280
Erm, what's the shibbity?

1467
02:33:57,280 --> 02:34:00,280
The actual shibbity? Is that Bethany?

1468
02:34:00,280 --> 02:34:02,280
Shibbity

1469
02:34:07,280 --> 02:34:11,280
Oh, I still haven't finished my immortal now that I think of it

1470
02:34:11,280 --> 02:34:16,280
We have to finish it, we have the last, like, I think, 15 chapters to do

1471
02:34:16,280 --> 02:34:22,280
And then Shebethany will disappear into the ether until I find another fanfiction

1472
02:34:23,280 --> 02:34:25,280
I have to go pack

1473
02:34:31,280 --> 02:34:34,280
I'm glad you guys liked ASMR

1474
02:34:37,280 --> 02:34:41,280
The fanfic? No, Twilight's not a fanfic, that's a book

1475
02:34:49,280 --> 02:34:52,280
But yes, I'm glad you guys enjoyed

1476
02:34:53,280 --> 02:34:57,280
No, you're thinking of Fifty Shades, love, you're thinking of Fifty Shades

1477
02:35:07,280 --> 02:35:11,280
Ugh, I guess I'll be all dick, okay, so I gotta go

1478
02:35:12,280 --> 02:35:15,280
I gotta go pack and I have to go call my mom

1479
02:35:20,280 --> 02:35:23,280
This is the part where I leave you guys

1480
02:35:23,280 --> 02:35:25,280
Oh, this is hard

1481
02:35:28,280 --> 02:35:31,280
I'm not gonna, hold on, let me switch to my normal mic

1482
02:35:31,280 --> 02:35:33,280
Let me switch

1483
02:35:36,280 --> 02:35:38,280
Okay

1484
02:36:02,280 --> 02:36:04,280
Hi

1485
02:36:07,280 --> 02:36:09,280
Sorry

1486
02:36:12,280 --> 02:36:14,280
Is it too loud?

1487
02:36:22,280 --> 02:36:24,280
Is it too loud?

1488
02:36:25,280 --> 02:36:28,280
Okay, I was like, I haven't changed anything

1489
02:36:31,280 --> 02:36:35,280
Yeah, it's louder because it's my normal mic

1490
02:36:36,280 --> 02:36:39,280
I shouldn't have done that mic warning, I'm sorry

1491
02:36:45,280 --> 02:36:49,280
I just turned this off, why is it still going?

1492
02:36:49,280 --> 02:36:51,280
I don't know how this still picks up

1493
02:36:54,280 --> 02:36:58,280
I turned the power off and OBS still picks it up

1494
02:36:59,280 --> 02:37:03,280
So yeah, so I'll be gone, I don't know why I'm like tilted

1495
02:37:03,280 --> 02:37:05,280
Why am I tilted?

1496
02:37:07,280 --> 02:37:12,280
You spin me right around, baby, right around

1497
02:37:12,280 --> 02:37:15,280
Like a good baby, right around, round, round

1498
02:37:30,280 --> 02:37:32,280
But

1499
02:37:33,280 --> 02:37:36,280
So yeah, I'll be gone for a little bit

1500
02:37:39,280 --> 02:37:43,280
Hope you don't miss me too much, because I know I'll miss you guys a lot

1501
02:37:51,280 --> 02:37:54,280
It's gonna be really hard to be gone

1502
02:37:54,280 --> 02:37:57,280
Again, I'm gonna try to be super active on socials

1503
02:37:57,280 --> 02:37:59,280
And

1504
02:38:02,280 --> 02:38:05,280
I'm really bummed out right now

1505
02:38:06,280 --> 02:38:10,280
Because you guys know I wanted to stream for you all the time

1506
02:38:10,280 --> 02:38:14,280
It's hard not to be there

1507
02:38:22,280 --> 02:38:26,280
My tears don't fall down my face anymore, I don't know why they broke

1508
02:38:32,280 --> 02:38:34,280
But I love you guys a lot

1509
02:38:34,280 --> 02:38:42,280
You know that it's gonna be super hard for me to be away from you

1510
02:38:42,280 --> 02:38:45,280
And I never can ever do

1511
02:38:45,280 --> 02:38:48,280
Oh yeah, people, it's been a month, it's been a month

1512
02:38:48,280 --> 02:38:51,280
Guys, it's been a month for members

1513
02:38:52,280 --> 02:38:58,280
Take care of yourselves, I'm leaving

1514
02:38:58,280 --> 02:39:00,280
I'm leaving the girls in charge

1515
02:39:00,280 --> 02:39:02,280
So behave

1516
02:39:05,280 --> 02:39:08,280
I was about to read Dono's, but thank you for yelling at me

1517
02:39:10,280 --> 02:39:12,280
I'm just saying, just saying

1518
02:39:12,280 --> 02:39:14,280
I don't miss you guys

1519
02:39:15,280 --> 02:39:18,280
Yeah, I can't believe it's already been a month

1520
02:39:18,280 --> 02:39:21,280
Wait, 20 more subs until 10k, you're joking

1521
02:39:22,280 --> 02:39:25,280
Sorry, I'm shrinking because I'm trying to look at my sub count

1522
02:39:25,280 --> 02:39:27,280
I can't even find it

1523
02:39:27,280 --> 02:39:29,280
It doesn't matter

1524
02:39:31,280 --> 02:39:38,280
But I can't believe we already achieved these numbers in such a short amount of time

1525
02:39:38,280 --> 02:39:43,280
As you guys know, it was my goal and my debut to hit 10k

1526
02:39:43,280 --> 02:39:45,280
And we're so close

1527
02:39:45,280 --> 02:39:47,280
And I just want to say thank you

1528
02:39:47,280 --> 02:39:49,280
You guys are wonderful

1529
02:39:49,280 --> 02:39:52,280
Thank you for renewing your memberships for the next month

1530
02:39:52,280 --> 02:39:57,280
I'm happy that I'm worthy enough for you to still give me your money and support me

1531
02:39:59,280 --> 02:40:01,280
But...

1532
02:40:02,280 --> 02:40:04,280
Yeah, I just...

1533
02:40:06,280 --> 02:40:08,280
A bit loud, turn down your damn headphones, bro

1534
02:40:08,280 --> 02:40:11,280
I switched them out from my 3D oh my

1535
02:40:11,280 --> 02:40:14,280
I literally just have no words besides

1536
02:40:14,280 --> 02:40:19,280
I just have the feeling of thankfulness and gratefulness and affection

1537
02:40:20,280 --> 02:40:22,280
It's crazy

1538
02:40:23,280 --> 02:40:25,280
Congrats on nearly getting 10k, thank you

1539
02:40:26,280 --> 02:40:29,280
But yeah, thank you members for renewing

1540
02:40:32,280 --> 02:40:34,280
I can't wait to come back

1541
02:40:34,280 --> 02:40:36,280
And...

1542
02:40:37,280 --> 02:40:42,280
I can't wait to come back and do a fun member stream for you guys

1543
02:40:42,280 --> 02:40:45,280
I think, yeah, we're gonna watch Salt Burn together

1544
02:40:46,280 --> 02:40:49,280
I was gonna do a karaoke, but I technically already did a karaoke

1545
02:40:49,280 --> 02:40:54,280
And that's up on the channel, so I'm like, I'll plan something a little bit better next time

1546
02:40:54,280 --> 02:40:57,280
Instead of that weird spare of the moment thing

1547
02:41:01,280 --> 02:41:03,280
Yeah, I'll miss you guys

1548
02:41:06,280 --> 02:41:10,280
Yes, the armpit pic for 10k is still the reward

1549
02:41:10,280 --> 02:41:13,280
I have it on standby, ready to be released into the ether

1550
02:41:13,280 --> 02:41:16,280
That is my alt account

1551
02:41:22,280 --> 02:41:24,280
Oh my goodness

1552
02:41:25,280 --> 02:41:27,280
Let me look at the doughnose

1553
02:41:36,280 --> 02:41:38,280
Oh my god

1554
02:41:52,280 --> 02:41:56,280
Alright, thank you for the $50 tip Ms. Morgan

1555
02:41:56,280 --> 02:41:59,280
The stream has meant more to me than I can properly describe

1556
02:41:59,280 --> 02:42:03,280
Being trans, I've often mourned the childhood I never got to have

1557
02:42:03,280 --> 02:42:07,280
This has let me experience a part of that childhood that I never thought I'd get to have

1558
02:42:07,280 --> 02:42:09,280
Thank you big sis, anytime

1559
02:42:09,280 --> 02:42:16,280
It's like, I'm an only child, so I never had anybody teach me to do makeup or do makeup on me

1560
02:42:16,280 --> 02:42:19,280
So I kind of wanted to share that moment with you

1561
02:42:19,280 --> 02:42:23,280
We both have an experience that we really never had before

1562
02:42:23,280 --> 02:42:27,280
I'm happy you enjoyed it, thank you so much for your support

1563
02:42:28,280 --> 02:42:32,280
Yeah, I know when you grow up a certain way

1564
02:42:32,280 --> 02:42:37,280
And you realize you don't have the same experiences that the average person may have

1565
02:42:37,280 --> 02:42:43,280
It's very bitter, but then it's better sweet because then you can always experience what's down the line

1566
02:42:43,280 --> 02:42:46,280
It takes a little bit more time, but you get there

1567
02:42:48,280 --> 02:42:50,280
Alright

1568
02:42:50,280 --> 02:42:53,280
Let me see, is there anything else?

1569
02:42:53,280 --> 02:42:55,280
Nope, I think that was it

1570
02:42:56,280 --> 02:42:59,280
And $5 from a super chat, let me see where that went

1571
02:42:59,280 --> 02:43:01,280
Where'd that super chat go?

1572
02:43:02,280 --> 02:43:05,280
What are you, thank you Falling Floor

1573
02:43:05,280 --> 02:43:07,280
What are you doing step sister?

1574
02:43:10,280 --> 02:43:14,280
I'm putting makeup on ya, so I'll make you my bitch

1575
02:43:19,280 --> 02:43:21,280
Did your mom not teach you?

1576
02:43:21,280 --> 02:43:23,280
No, not really

1577
02:43:23,280 --> 02:43:25,280
My mom didn't want me to wear makeup

1578
02:43:25,280 --> 02:43:27,280
I taught myself how to do makeup

1579
02:43:27,280 --> 02:43:31,280
And again, makeup that my mom does is a lot different from the makeup that I did

1580
02:43:31,280 --> 02:43:35,280
If you look through the years about how makeup has changed in the last few decades

1581
02:43:35,280 --> 02:43:37,280
It's very significant, not really significant

1582
02:43:37,280 --> 02:43:40,280
My mom just throw blue eyeshadow over her eyes in mascara

1583
02:43:43,280 --> 02:43:45,280
What am I going to do in the evenings while you're gone?

1584
02:43:45,280 --> 02:43:50,280
You can study your Bible, but you just can't finish the verse, that's what you can do

1585
02:43:51,280 --> 02:43:55,280
I won't have Shebe to keep me company at work for the next week

1586
02:43:55,280 --> 02:43:57,280
I know, and I won't have you

1587
02:43:57,280 --> 02:43:58,280
What the fuck?

1588
02:43:58,280 --> 02:44:01,280
Oh, it's me because I'm bouncing my leg because I'm anxious

1589
02:44:01,280 --> 02:44:04,280
Because I don't want to leave, I don't want to end the stream

1590
02:44:05,280 --> 02:44:08,280
Shebe's going hard into the fentanyl

1591
02:44:08,280 --> 02:44:11,280
I honestly, I just wanted to do that because I just kind of wanted to pamper you

1592
02:44:11,280 --> 02:44:17,280
And men don't usually get that opportunity to be pampered and kind of taken care of

1593
02:44:17,280 --> 02:44:22,280
And I can tell that a lot of you took a lot from this, from the skincare portion

1594
02:44:22,280 --> 02:44:26,280
And honestly, in my opinion, I think men should be able to wear makeup

1595
02:44:26,280 --> 02:44:30,280
Not in a huge way how women wear it

1596
02:44:30,280 --> 02:44:35,280
But you should be able to wear makeup in terms of like, oh, maybe you want to contour your jaw

1597
02:44:35,280 --> 02:44:39,280
Or maybe you want to conceal some zits

1598
02:44:39,280 --> 02:44:42,280
I feel like that should be more normalized

1599
02:44:42,280 --> 02:44:45,280
I thought I was a cat, no, it's me bouncing my leg

1600
02:44:45,280 --> 02:44:50,280
But yeah, I just wanted to pamper you and remind you that you're loved and I care for you

1601
02:44:50,280 --> 02:44:54,280
And then I'll brush your hair, I'll make your skin nice

1602
02:44:54,280 --> 02:44:57,280
And I'll do your makeup and I'll give you kisses

1603
02:45:01,280 --> 02:45:03,280
200 plus people quite a lot of people don't really brush your hair

1604
02:45:05,280 --> 02:45:12,280
I just, like for me personally, I'm a very, whoa

1605
02:45:13,280 --> 02:45:18,280
I got really confused because I thought that was USD

1606
02:45:18,280 --> 02:45:20,280
And I was gonna piss myself

1607
02:45:22,280 --> 02:45:25,280
Thank you so much for the donovie for Supa

1608
02:45:25,280 --> 02:45:28,280
Wow, that's so kind of you

1609
02:45:30,280 --> 02:45:33,280
Yeah, I was literally like, what?

1610
02:45:33,280 --> 02:45:37,280
And I was gonna, I was literally, yeah, everybody else

1611
02:45:38,280 --> 02:45:41,280
I'm happy, I'm happy I'm not the only one

1612
02:45:42,280 --> 02:45:46,280
I have to, I don't know how much that is in USD

1613
02:45:48,280 --> 02:45:50,280
But thank you

1614
02:45:51,280 --> 02:45:54,280
If it was 100K or otherwise

1615
02:45:59,280 --> 02:46:01,280
Yeah, $6, yes

1616
02:46:01,280 --> 02:46:03,280
What, what is that from?

1617
02:46:03,280 --> 02:46:05,280
I don't know, what, um

1618
02:46:08,280 --> 02:46:10,280
What is that from?

1619
02:46:10,280 --> 02:46:12,280
Indonesia, oh, okay, got you, got you

1620
02:46:14,280 --> 02:46:18,280
Now a rich chatter should drop to 100K for the bit

1621
02:46:18,280 --> 02:46:21,280
I don't, I don't think I have anybody like that watching me

1622
02:46:23,280 --> 02:46:25,280
I don't, I don't think so

1623
02:46:27,280 --> 02:46:34,280
But just some random Arabian prince is like, yes, I like, I like this bunny

1624
02:46:35,280 --> 02:46:36,280
Here you are

1625
02:46:41,280 --> 02:46:45,280
Bill Gates, just like Tim Cook, just here you go

1626
02:46:46,280 --> 02:46:49,280
The one oil baron, his biding his time

1627
02:46:49,280 --> 02:46:53,280
Waiting for my birthday, Jonathan to occur

1628
02:46:53,280 --> 02:46:56,280
The bunny is delectable to 100K

1629
02:46:58,280 --> 02:47:00,280
100,000, yes

1630
02:47:04,280 --> 02:47:05,280
Hey, madame

1631
02:47:05,280 --> 02:47:08,280
No, for you guys are fine, don't worry about that

1632
02:47:08,280 --> 02:47:13,280
Giving, giving me money wouldn't, um, make me treat you any different

1633
02:47:13,280 --> 02:47:15,280
How small or large

1634
02:47:16,280 --> 02:47:19,280
Um, quick, everybody find a lottery ticket

1635
02:47:21,280 --> 02:47:24,280
It's okay, I'm poor too, we can be poor together

1636
02:47:24,280 --> 02:47:25,280
Yep

1637
02:47:26,280 --> 02:47:28,280
Um, what was I gonna say?

1638
02:47:29,280 --> 02:47:35,280
But, uh, I just, a part of me is just really, doesn't want to leave

1639
02:47:35,280 --> 02:47:39,280
I really feel like you guys, and you can make fun of me, I don't care

1640
02:47:39,280 --> 02:47:42,280
But I feel like you guys are gonna leave me and be like, oh, she's gone for a week

1641
02:47:42,280 --> 02:47:48,280
Let me go find another oh she, um, let me go find another streamer

1642
02:47:48,280 --> 02:47:56,280
And you just never come back to me and you never, you never want to, you never want anything to do with me again

1643
02:47:57,280 --> 02:48:00,280
And that scares me, I guess I have a fear of abandonment

1644
02:48:01,280 --> 02:48:05,280
Um, and I know some of you guys do too, cause you guys are scared that I'm leaving

1645
02:48:05,280 --> 02:48:15,280
But just know that I'm also scared to be leaving cause I'm, I'm the same exact way that I'm bouncing my legs so hard

1646
02:48:15,280 --> 02:48:21,280
I need to calm down, um, I need to just like, I'm just like, let me just stim, let me just stim

1647
02:48:23,280 --> 02:48:28,280
I am, I am needy streamer, that is, that is indeed me

1648
02:48:31,280 --> 02:48:41,280
But, I have to remind myself and I look at your comments and I look at your, your sweet tweets at me

1649
02:48:41,280 --> 02:48:50,280
Um, and I just remind myself, no, that's not true, don't let the breadworm, the breadworms, the brainworms, win

1650
02:48:50,280 --> 02:48:53,280
They, they love me as much as I care for them

1651
02:48:53,280 --> 02:48:57,280
I remember, I was scrolling on Twitter and I saw a tweet

1652
02:48:57,280 --> 02:49:00,280
And it's one of those like, from one of those stupid accounts, a tweet romance stuff

1653
02:49:00,280 --> 02:49:12,280
But it said, I know a love like the one I want exists because I have that love within myself

1654
02:49:12,280 --> 02:49:14,280
And I want to give it to someone, something like that

1655
02:49:14,280 --> 02:49:24,280
And I think, I think that kind of just, it's you guys, like I know you guys give me the same energy back

1656
02:49:25,280 --> 02:49:28,280
You match my freak, so to speak

1657
02:49:30,280 --> 02:49:35,280
Um, so I'm just very thankful for you

1658
02:49:35,280 --> 02:49:42,280
Uh, please don't forget me or be sad in my absence, I'll still be around, I'll try to do a Twitter space

1659
02:49:42,280 --> 02:49:45,280
I'll have short settles go up

1660
02:49:45,280 --> 02:49:51,280
Again, I am profusely apologizing because I did not have time with everything that I was doing

1661
02:49:51,280 --> 02:49:57,280
To, um, finish the ASMR video, but I will do it immediately when I come back home

1662
02:49:57,280 --> 02:50:05,280
Um, I have some fun stuff planned when I come back, some script writing, Zatsu

1663
02:50:05,280 --> 02:50:08,280
Upon my return, we can write a script together

1664
02:50:11,280 --> 02:50:15,280
Uh, obviously I want to play Elden Ring, going to watch Saltburn

1665
02:50:15,280 --> 02:50:23,280
Uh, have some collabs, I've been touching base with a lot of really sweet, amazing girls, VTubers

1666
02:50:23,280 --> 02:50:27,280
And I can't wait to spend time with them, oh they're very sweet

1667
02:50:27,280 --> 02:50:32,280
And I appreciate them for giving me a chance to just like hang out and be cool

1668
02:50:36,280 --> 02:50:42,280
I'll leave you guys voice messages, I'll leave like little voice messages on my ultimate Twitter

1669
02:50:46,280 --> 02:50:49,280
I wish I could give you guys a hug

1670
02:50:49,280 --> 02:50:52,280
Like I think cause I need a hug right now

1671
02:50:52,280 --> 02:50:56,280
I'm so scared to leave, I don't want to leave

1672
02:50:59,280 --> 02:51:03,280
Mama raised proper men, we are here to stay, I hope so

1673
02:51:03,280 --> 02:51:09,280
It's gonna be so hard to enjoy myself because I realize I enjoy myself the most when I'm with you

1674
02:51:11,280 --> 02:51:14,280
And I'm trying not to cry but that's the truth

1675
02:51:15,280 --> 02:51:21,280
Oh my big baby, you've had me, I've been had, I'm a big baby and you know wipe my eyes

1676
02:51:28,280 --> 02:51:31,280
But yes, I'm giving hugs right back

1677
02:51:31,280 --> 02:51:34,280
Hug the mic, hug the mic, hug the mic

1678
02:51:39,280 --> 02:51:40,280
Yeah

1679
02:51:45,280 --> 02:51:49,280
You guys know I'm a softy but like I think that's what makes me a good dom

1680
02:51:49,280 --> 02:51:58,280
Because I'll be soft, I'll be sweet and isn't it so much better when you have someone like me just like tearing your ass up, you know

1681
02:51:58,280 --> 02:52:04,280
When you have someone like me to put you in your place and make you beg and bark on your knees

1682
02:52:04,280 --> 02:52:10,280
Use you as a foot stool, hit you with my crop, oh that reminds me

1683
02:52:10,280 --> 02:52:13,280
Something came in today, I want to show you guys, hold on

1684
02:52:16,280 --> 02:52:17,280
Oh

1685
02:52:22,280 --> 02:52:28,280
My neighbor was like, oh do you want me to start bringing up your mail for you because I see you get mail a lot

1686
02:52:28,280 --> 02:52:33,280
And I'm like, no you don't have to at all, oh crap my cat's vet just called me

1687
02:52:33,280 --> 02:52:37,280
I hope they leave a message, it's probably with Reina's blood work

1688
02:52:38,280 --> 02:52:39,280
Um

1689
02:52:40,280 --> 02:52:44,280
Oh gosh I hope it's not like bad news because I'm gonna lose it if it's bad news man

1690
02:52:44,280 --> 02:52:46,280
I don't want to deal with that right now

1691
02:52:47,280 --> 02:52:50,280
But yeah I told my neighbor, please don't get my stuff

1692
02:52:50,280 --> 02:52:54,280
Why is this in a plastic bag? This is just a big ziploc bag

1693
02:52:55,280 --> 02:52:57,280
I don't know how I feel about that

1694
02:52:58,280 --> 02:52:59,280
It's fine

1695
02:53:01,280 --> 02:53:03,280
Can you guess what this item is?

1696
02:53:07,280 --> 02:53:10,280
Mmm it smells interesting

1697
02:53:10,280 --> 02:53:13,280
Hold on there's like zip ties around it, I need scissors

1698
02:53:13,280 --> 02:53:15,280
Do I have a knife over here?

1699
02:53:15,280 --> 02:53:18,280
I swear to God I thought I had a knife over here

1700
02:53:18,280 --> 02:53:23,280
I might not be able to do $10,000 but I could do $10, you're fine

1701
02:53:23,280 --> 02:53:25,280
Thank you for your first soup, you're so sweet

1702
02:53:26,280 --> 02:53:30,280
You take, yeah my mom will be watching over my cats

1703
02:53:30,280 --> 02:53:36,280
And I also have the, what's it called, the cat cam

1704
02:53:37,280 --> 02:53:42,280
So I'll be able to see them and I can shoot treats at them

1705
02:53:43,280 --> 02:53:45,280
Sorry I'm looking for scissors

1706
02:53:45,280 --> 02:53:46,280
Scissors

1707
02:53:57,280 --> 02:53:59,280
Zip ties

1708
02:54:00,280 --> 02:54:04,280
I will leave, I need some more, I'm gonna miss you so much

1709
02:54:05,280 --> 02:54:07,280
You jump into the freaking bridge

1710
02:54:08,280 --> 02:54:09,280
Alright

1711
02:54:10,280 --> 02:54:18,280
How am I gonna use this? This isn't, I feel like I'm gonna hurt myself with it

1712
02:54:20,280 --> 02:54:26,280
Like what do I do with this? I should have never accepted this gift

1713
02:54:27,280 --> 02:54:31,280
I already hit all my toys, the shoes finally came in today

1714
02:54:32,280 --> 02:54:34,280
It's not shabari, can you hear it?

1715
02:54:34,280 --> 02:54:39,280
Be careful with the whip, that's right it's a whip

1716
02:54:40,280 --> 02:54:45,280
Can I, oh, can you hear that?

1717
02:54:54,280 --> 02:54:55,280
Can you hear it?

1718
02:54:56,280 --> 02:55:00,280
Can you hear the whip? This thing is so big, I have a giant ass whip

1719
02:55:05,280 --> 02:55:06,280
Oh

1720
02:55:16,280 --> 02:55:20,280
It is a four or five foot long bull whip?

1721
02:55:21,280 --> 02:55:31,280
Um, yeah, no, I'm good, don't worry, I'm not, I'm not doing anything

1722
02:55:32,280 --> 02:55:35,280
But yeah, I have a whip now, I feel like fucking catwoman

1723
02:55:36,280 --> 02:55:39,280
I wanna do a catwoman cosplay, Michelle Pfeiffer style

1724
02:55:40,280 --> 02:55:43,280
I can just twirl this around me like a motherfucker

1725
02:55:44,280 --> 02:55:49,280
Oh, thank you so much for the soupa

1726
02:55:51,280 --> 02:55:53,280
I thought that was $500,000

1727
02:55:56,280 --> 02:56:01,280
That just keeps freaking me out, cause I like, I pause and I'm like, okay, wait, no, I'm fine

1728
02:56:03,280 --> 02:56:07,280
I was just like, uh, that was just terrified me

1729
02:56:08,280 --> 02:56:13,280
I would have been like, please, please don't give me that much money

1730
02:56:14,280 --> 02:56:16,280
Thank you, thank you so much of you

1731
02:56:30,280 --> 02:56:33,280
So kind, I just hit my hands on my microphone

1732
02:56:33,280 --> 02:56:36,280
But yeah, I got a whip now, I don't know where I'm gonna put this

1733
02:56:37,280 --> 02:56:39,280
Where do I put this big ass whip?

1734
02:56:39,280 --> 02:56:40,280
Boomi, you want it?

1735
02:56:42,280 --> 02:56:43,280
Take a little sniff

1736
02:56:44,280 --> 02:56:45,280
Boomi's sniffing

1737
02:56:49,280 --> 02:56:52,280
Oh my god, I hope my mom doesn't fight into this big ass whip

1738
02:56:59,280 --> 02:57:00,280
I don't know

1739
02:57:03,280 --> 02:57:05,280
I think soupas can only go to $500

1740
02:57:07,280 --> 02:57:14,280
Keep in mind, if you do a soupa, most of it, most, most of it, I'm suddenly Australian, um, most

1741
02:57:16,280 --> 02:57:20,280
It'll go to YouTube, so Streamlabs is the best way to go

1742
02:57:25,280 --> 02:57:28,280
Say it's for horseback riding and rodeo lessons

1743
02:57:28,280 --> 02:57:31,280
No, my parents know what I do for a living, guys

1744
02:57:31,280 --> 02:57:35,280
They know what I do, they know that I'm a lewd voice actress

1745
02:57:43,280 --> 02:57:46,280
No way, you're just telling me that now, I thought that's usually, I thought that was common knowledge

1746
02:57:48,280 --> 02:57:52,280
Do you like the whip, madam? Please be careful, the cats, don't you want it? Yes I do

1747
02:57:53,280 --> 02:57:56,280
Yes I do, thank you Taft Potential, I do like it a lot

1748
02:57:56,280 --> 02:58:03,280
Wait, I can't even see, if anybody did don't know normally, I can't even see Streamlabs because I don't have it open

1749
02:58:09,280 --> 02:58:10,280
Yeah

1750
02:58:15,280 --> 02:58:16,280
Yippee

1751
02:58:20,280 --> 02:58:21,280
YouTube takes 30%

1752
02:58:22,280 --> 02:58:24,280
Cat toy, cat toy, do it

1753
02:58:24,280 --> 02:58:26,280
What do you think, Reyna? What do you think about this?

1754
02:58:27,280 --> 02:58:30,280
Ooh, Reyna's excited, Reyna wants to play with the whip

1755
02:58:32,280 --> 02:58:37,280
Ooh, you like that Reyna? She's like, she's like trying to grab it with her paw

1756
02:58:39,280 --> 02:58:42,280
I don't know if you could hear her, she's on like the plastic bag it came in

1757
02:58:43,280 --> 02:58:47,280
No, Reyna let it go, Reyna let it go, I have to clip their claws after this

1758
02:58:47,280 --> 02:58:50,280
Reyna let go, I shouldn't have taught you to play with that

1759
02:58:50,280 --> 02:58:55,280
Alright, I wonder what this would feel like to hit someone with a bend over

1760
02:58:55,280 --> 02:58:59,280
Okay, where do I put this? Where do I hide with it? I don't know where to hide with it

1761
02:59:21,280 --> 02:59:25,280
Okay, I think I hid it

1762
02:59:26,280 --> 02:59:30,280
I shoved it in a place in my closet, I hope my mom doesn't notice

1763
02:59:37,280 --> 02:59:41,280
Oh, I don't want to leave, I don't want to leave, I don't want to leave, I just want to be with you

1764
02:59:44,280 --> 02:59:45,280
But I have to go pack

1765
02:59:46,280 --> 02:59:48,280
I'm 10K? Are you 10K?

1766
02:59:50,280 --> 02:59:53,280
No way, we hit 10K

1767
03:00:02,280 --> 03:00:06,280
Oh my god, it's okay, we're gonna get called, but we hit 10K

1768
03:00:08,280 --> 03:00:12,280
Holy shit, we hit 10K

1769
03:00:12,280 --> 03:00:15,280
Oh my god

1770
03:00:16,280 --> 03:00:20,280
I can't believe we hit 10K live on stream, that's insane

1771
03:00:20,280 --> 03:00:23,280
How did my thing go up to me?

1772
03:00:25,280 --> 03:00:26,280
What the heck?

1773
03:00:28,280 --> 03:00:30,280
10K, let's go!

1774
03:00:31,280 --> 03:00:34,280
There's 10K harlots that love me

1775
03:00:36,280 --> 03:00:41,280
Oh, I'm so proud of us, again, it's 10K of you

1776
03:00:41,280 --> 03:00:45,280
You did this, you wonderful harlots, you...

1777
03:00:47,280 --> 03:00:49,280
Now you get an armpit picture

1778
03:00:50,280 --> 03:00:52,280
Are you happy? You get to see my armpit

1779
03:00:57,280 --> 03:00:59,280
You get to see my armpit

1780
03:01:00,280 --> 03:01:02,280
Armpit, armpit

1781
03:01:07,280 --> 03:01:11,280
Okay, I made a promise that if we hit 10K, which I didn't think would be this soon

1782
03:01:12,280 --> 03:01:17,280
I'd post a picture of my armpit mole, because I have an armpit beauty mark

1783
03:01:23,280 --> 03:01:26,280
If you're new here, by the way, I'm brown

1784
03:01:27,280 --> 03:01:32,280
So my armpit will not be a beautiful alabaster porcelain white

1785
03:01:32,280 --> 03:01:34,280
I am a brown girl, I am tan

1786
03:01:35,280 --> 03:01:38,280
So you'll get a nice tan pit

1787
03:01:42,280 --> 03:01:46,280
Armpits are like the five hot as well, as you're not really getting my armpit

1788
03:01:46,280 --> 03:01:48,280
Like it was just the mole, I said

1789
03:01:48,280 --> 03:01:51,280
I'm kind of shy to show you guys my armpit

1790
03:01:51,280 --> 03:01:56,280
Because armpits are not as pretty as they are drawn

1791
03:01:56,280 --> 03:01:59,280
I do not have a vagina looking armpit

1792
03:02:06,280 --> 03:02:08,280
All armpits are beautiful

1793
03:02:10,280 --> 03:02:20,280
Because like, you know how they draw them looking like succulent, wet, smooth as a fucking slug

1794
03:02:22,280 --> 03:02:26,280
Like, I almost had a turtle for some reason

1795
03:02:29,280 --> 03:02:33,280
Guys, I shave my armpits, I have like little hair stubble

1796
03:02:35,280 --> 03:02:39,280
And when you're brown, your pits are more melanated

1797
03:02:41,280 --> 03:02:43,280
So I got some melanated pits

1798
03:02:46,280 --> 03:02:49,280
I think in the picture you also get a little bit of my hair

1799
03:02:49,280 --> 03:02:56,280
But again, I only reveal, I don't normally, like, I'm a VTuber first and foremost, everyone

1800
03:02:56,280 --> 03:03:02,280
I only do like hand cams and thigh cams, foot cams, what have you

1801
03:03:04,280 --> 03:03:10,280
And like little cosplays that show off my RTX form

1802
03:03:10,280 --> 03:03:15,280
Only for milestones, it is not on a daily basis, by the way

1803
03:03:15,280 --> 03:03:23,280
I'm not a flush tuber, I'm not, as they say, a twitch thought that's come to ruin VTuber

1804
03:03:23,280 --> 03:03:29,280
That is not me, I only do it because I like to give you guys little treats and you ask for it

1805
03:03:29,280 --> 03:03:35,280
So, yeah, you're never seeing my face, I am sheebie

1806
03:03:35,280 --> 03:03:43,280
Soon enough, my tanness will reflect it in my 2D form, my true form if you will

1807
03:03:44,280 --> 03:03:48,280
So, yeah, 100k, we get the other pit, well, wouldn't it be 20k?

1808
03:03:48,280 --> 03:03:54,280
20k, I don't have anything on my other pit though, so, I don't know

1809
03:03:57,280 --> 03:03:58,280
My emotes

1810
03:04:00,280 --> 03:04:02,280
Yeah, I know, I need to figure that out

1811
03:04:04,280 --> 03:04:10,280
When we get eyeball pics, you'll never get an eyeball pic because that is a part of my face

1812
03:04:10,280 --> 03:04:11,280
I'm sorry

1813
03:04:17,280 --> 03:04:19,280
What was the next milestone?

1814
03:04:20,280 --> 03:04:23,280
I'll probably say, I don't know

1815
03:04:26,280 --> 03:04:29,280
Yay, new members, neck reveal, guys, I'm not

1816
03:04:31,280 --> 03:04:38,280
You're never seeing my eyes, you're never seeing my mouth, you're never seeing my ear

1817
03:04:41,280 --> 03:04:45,280
Next milestone, 100k

1818
03:04:49,280 --> 03:04:53,280
Neck reveal is wild, it will just be just brown skin

1819
03:04:53,280 --> 03:05:01,280
Oh, thank you, LGF, thank you for the 50 gifted

1820
03:05:01,280 --> 03:05:07,280
Absolutely insane, amazing way to celebrate getting 10k

1821
03:05:08,280 --> 03:05:12,280
Okay, I'll say it, I guess you are my little pog champ

1822
03:05:17,280 --> 03:05:19,280
Okay, like, brown woman she means

1823
03:05:26,280 --> 03:05:31,280
Everybody's like, yay, more, more gifted

1824
03:05:31,280 --> 03:05:33,280
Thank you so much

1825
03:05:33,280 --> 03:05:34,280
LGF

1826
03:05:37,280 --> 03:05:40,280
I feel so bad for my lurkers that like, post because they're like, did I win?

1827
03:05:40,280 --> 03:05:48,280
And then, but the gotcha, the gotcha did not grant them what they wanted

1828
03:05:54,280 --> 03:05:56,280
I'm just here long for the ride

1829
03:05:57,280 --> 03:05:59,280
One the gotcha

1830
03:06:10,280 --> 03:06:14,280
Remember, if you guys want to, yeah, it's 50, it's going to take a bit

1831
03:06:14,280 --> 03:06:22,280
If you guys still want to, if you want to watch Salt Burn with me

1832
03:06:22,280 --> 03:06:27,280
When we do the watch along, when I come back, you can always upgrade to the member tier

1833
03:06:27,280 --> 03:06:30,280
Because this is just emotes, and you have to be

1834
03:06:30,280 --> 03:06:38,280
Hell yeah, Castle Hellford, a dollar, thank you, so sweet

1835
03:06:38,280 --> 03:06:43,280
I'll heart that for you, what a sweet little castle

1836
03:06:53,280 --> 03:06:57,280
I can do a lot with one doll, I can buy myself some candy

1837
03:06:57,280 --> 03:07:00,280
I can get myself an espresso shot, probably not

1838
03:07:04,280 --> 03:07:09,280
Looking forward to the bathtub seat and salt, me too, me too

1839
03:07:11,280 --> 03:07:16,280
If you haven't seen Salt Burn, do not look anything up, that is an order

1840
03:07:17,280 --> 03:07:21,280
You're so beautiful and gorgeous, oh thank you, oh stop it

1841
03:07:21,280 --> 03:07:24,280
You're going to make me blush, oh goodness

1842
03:07:30,280 --> 03:07:35,280
Good, good, good, you better be scared, you better be scared

1843
03:07:37,280 --> 03:07:43,280
No spoilers, no spoilers

1844
03:07:44,280 --> 03:07:47,280
I'm debating whether or not to fart in the mic

1845
03:07:49,280 --> 03:07:52,280
A little cheeky brat for 10k

1846
03:07:54,280 --> 03:07:57,280
Are you going to watch the boys finale, oh shit

1847
03:07:57,280 --> 03:08:01,280
Oh no, I won't be able to watch the boys finale

1848
03:08:03,280 --> 03:08:06,280
Oh wait, no, I don't leave till the late

1849
03:08:07,280 --> 03:08:11,280
I don't leave till the, I'm not going to say when

1850
03:08:13,280 --> 03:08:19,280
Nobody charge my flight please, I should, maybe if I can

1851
03:08:20,280 --> 03:08:24,280
Watch it on the flight, oh that's true, I can watch it on the flight

1852
03:08:24,280 --> 03:08:26,280
Yeah I'll do, well no, I'll just be screaming the entire time

1853
03:08:26,280 --> 03:08:30,280
What if somebody gets like, is like some really gory shit

1854
03:08:30,280 --> 03:08:33,280
Or like sexual shit is happening in the finale

1855
03:08:33,280 --> 03:08:36,280
And I'm just sitting there watching it with some poor normal person

1856
03:08:36,280 --> 03:08:38,280
A sweet little lady looking over to my iPad

1857
03:08:38,280 --> 03:08:41,280
And somebody's getting like finger bangs

1858
03:08:42,280 --> 03:08:43,280
Or whatever

1859
03:08:50,280 --> 03:08:56,280
Wait, wait, are you a, are you a, are you a, a role player?

1860
03:08:56,280 --> 03:08:59,280
I think role player chatters are some of my favorite chatters

1861
03:08:59,280 --> 03:09:02,280
Okay the person who proposed role plays this Friday

1862
03:09:02,280 --> 03:09:04,280
Now I got some of the role plays of Sans

1863
03:09:04,280 --> 03:09:06,280
Now I can just follow

1864
03:09:08,280 --> 03:09:10,280
That's how I'll read your comments from now on

1865
03:09:12,280 --> 03:09:14,280
Sitting next to a nun

1866
03:09:14,280 --> 03:09:16,280
I'm sitting next to a nun and we're doing it

1867
03:09:16,280 --> 03:09:18,280
On the plane in front of everyone

1868
03:09:31,280 --> 03:09:33,280
I can't go that deep

1869
03:09:33,280 --> 03:09:37,280
Mile Halakai Club with the sweet old nun that'll be sitting next to me

1870
03:09:38,280 --> 03:09:42,280
I saw an old guy watching straight up corn on his phone in an aisle seat

1871
03:09:42,280 --> 03:09:44,280
Geez

1872
03:09:44,280 --> 03:09:46,280
Oh my god

1873
03:09:46,280 --> 03:09:48,280
I, I forget where I'm sitting on the right

1874
03:09:48,280 --> 03:09:52,280
All I know is that my plane ride back is gonna be shitty

1875
03:09:52,280 --> 03:09:55,280
Because I'm in the middle of my plane ride back

1876
03:09:55,280 --> 03:09:58,280
On my plane ride there, I'm in the window

1877
03:09:58,280 --> 03:10:00,280
To the walls

1878
03:10:02,280 --> 03:10:06,280
I thought it was a mistake to eat snacks while watching the web viewer tech night episode

1879
03:10:08,280 --> 03:10:10,280
Oh that was fun

1880
03:10:11,280 --> 03:10:13,280
Yes it is, I should be Undertale

1881
03:10:13,280 --> 03:10:16,280
I wanted to play Undertale at one point because I think the voice acting would be fun

1882
03:10:16,280 --> 03:10:23,280
But I would not want to play the whole game

1883
03:10:23,280 --> 03:10:25,280
And it's really hard to get through

1884
03:10:25,280 --> 03:10:28,280
Because I would just want to do Papyrus' voice

1885
03:10:28,280 --> 03:10:30,280
Make him sound like Skeletor like everybody else does

1886
03:10:32,280 --> 03:10:34,280
You've solved my puzzle

1887
03:10:37,280 --> 03:10:40,280
You're still on season 3? Hurry up

1888
03:10:46,280 --> 03:10:48,280
By the power of puzzles

1889
03:10:51,280 --> 03:10:54,280
Wonderland's dungeon has definitely funded my tech night with all the equipment

1890
03:10:54,280 --> 03:10:57,280
You think I'm funded by a man who runs prisons

1891
03:10:57,280 --> 03:11:00,280
And is a little white nationalist

1892
03:11:00,280 --> 03:11:06,280
It's rage inducing

1893
03:11:06,280 --> 03:11:08,280
I never thought it was rage inducing

1894
03:11:16,280 --> 03:11:18,280
Great comment, thank you

1895
03:11:19,280 --> 03:11:24,280
Literally my OG name before I got the daddy sign on Bob in it from Bob from Temmie

1896
03:11:24,280 --> 03:11:30,280
I still, I know I'm mentally ill because sometimes I'll just go

1897
03:11:30,280 --> 03:11:32,280
Hi I'm Temmie, just like randomly

1898
03:11:33,280 --> 03:11:36,280
Hi, hi I'm Temmie

1899
03:11:36,280 --> 03:11:38,280
Hi, I'm Temmie

1900
03:11:40,280 --> 03:11:42,280
I just do that

1901
03:11:42,280 --> 03:11:44,280
I just do that, normally

1902
03:11:47,280 --> 03:11:49,280
Hi, I'm Chibi

1903
03:11:55,280 --> 03:11:58,280
I'm literally I'm Sans and I'm Temmie

1904
03:11:58,280 --> 03:12:00,280
Hi, I'm Temmie

1905
03:12:00,280 --> 03:12:02,280
Temmie Flakes

1906
03:12:02,280 --> 03:12:04,280
Temmie Flakes

1907
03:12:06,280 --> 03:12:08,280
Hoives

1908
03:12:08,280 --> 03:12:11,280
And her thoughts just working out whenever they feel like it

1909
03:12:11,280 --> 03:12:14,280
Because sometimes I'm the type of person where if I see like a word

1910
03:12:14,280 --> 03:12:16,280
And it reminds me of like a quote

1911
03:12:16,280 --> 03:12:18,280
I'm gonna say the quote out loud

1912
03:12:19,280 --> 03:12:22,280
And I'm just impulsive like that

1913
03:12:22,280 --> 03:12:24,280
I'm glad I'm not the only one from what the chat is saying

1914
03:12:27,280 --> 03:12:31,280
My undyne impression will just sound like a really hot tomboy

1915
03:12:32,280 --> 03:12:35,280
And then like my alphys impression will be like

1916
03:12:36,280 --> 03:12:38,280
Hi Undyne

1917
03:12:38,280 --> 03:12:42,280
I was wondering if you want to go back to my laboratory and watch anime

1918
03:12:43,280 --> 03:12:45,280
Well I don't know, should we alphys?

1919
03:12:45,280 --> 03:12:47,280
I gotta kill these guys over here

1920
03:12:49,280 --> 03:12:51,280
Something like that, I don't know

1921
03:12:53,280 --> 03:12:54,280
Um

1922
03:13:00,280 --> 03:13:03,280
Sometimes when I think of a move in a word I just automatically start doing it

1923
03:13:03,280 --> 03:13:04,280
Yeah, same

1924
03:13:04,280 --> 03:13:06,280
We love the gay fish

1925
03:13:08,280 --> 03:13:10,280
That's the voice you gave Dusa, you're right

1926
03:13:10,280 --> 03:13:12,280
I did give Dusa that voice

1927
03:13:13,280 --> 03:13:15,280
Can we get a so sorry impression?

1928
03:13:15,280 --> 03:13:17,280
I don't know what that references to

1929
03:13:17,280 --> 03:13:20,280
Is that a character within Undertale?

1930
03:13:22,280 --> 03:13:25,280
I played Deltarune as well

1931
03:13:25,280 --> 03:13:27,280
And I loved, I really like Deltarune

1932
03:13:27,280 --> 03:13:32,280
I have to fin, I think they, did they finish the like newer episodes of Deltarune?

1933
03:13:32,280 --> 03:13:33,280
I don't know

1934
03:13:33,280 --> 03:13:35,280
And he put my 3D away, it's like in my face

1935
03:13:35,280 --> 03:13:37,280
I can barely see the screen

1936
03:13:38,280 --> 03:13:40,280
State fast, rip fast

1937
03:13:40,280 --> 03:13:42,280
I can't stay there

1938
03:13:43,280 --> 03:13:45,280
Toriel British

1939
03:13:45,280 --> 03:13:47,280
Does everybody make Toriel British?

1940
03:13:47,280 --> 03:13:49,280
I probably would then

1941
03:13:50,280 --> 03:13:54,280
Um, I baked you a butterscotch cake

1942
03:13:54,280 --> 03:13:55,280
Cake?

1943
03:13:55,280 --> 03:13:58,280
I baked you, I baked you a butterscotch pie

1944
03:13:58,280 --> 03:14:00,280
I hope you think it would be really delightful

1945
03:14:01,280 --> 03:14:03,280
I worked really hard on it, you know

1946
03:14:03,280 --> 03:14:06,280
Um, I think you belong here, just fine

1947
03:14:10,280 --> 03:14:12,280
Chapter 2's out, okay

1948
03:14:12,280 --> 03:14:14,280
I never, I didn't read, I didn't read

1949
03:14:14,280 --> 03:14:16,280
I didn't do Chapter 2 then

1950
03:14:17,280 --> 03:14:19,280
Great CC voice

1951
03:14:19,280 --> 03:14:20,280
Has the Brit not bad

1952
03:14:20,280 --> 03:14:22,280
You should go see, I think I retweeted it

1953
03:14:22,280 --> 03:14:25,280
It's not an actual short, but I kind of want to upload it as an actual short

1954
03:14:25,280 --> 03:14:27,280
And give credit to the person who made it

1955
03:14:27,280 --> 03:14:29,280
I did a whole British bit

1956
03:14:29,280 --> 03:14:30,280
Um, with my Goexla

1957
03:14:30,280 --> 03:14:32,280
I can do a British accent very well

1958
03:14:32,280 --> 03:14:36,280
Cause I really like period, um, TV shows and films

1959
03:14:37,280 --> 03:14:40,280
And I would just watch British stuff with my mom all the time

1960
03:14:40,280 --> 03:14:43,280
Um, I also used to watch a lot of Love Island, so

1961
03:14:44,280 --> 03:14:46,280
Butterscotch cinnamon pie, it was good

1962
03:14:47,280 --> 03:14:51,280
I remember one of the characters in the game, Sundar Plain and Sundare

1963
03:14:52,280 --> 03:14:55,280
That's right, yeah, the one that like kind of like blushes at you

1964
03:14:55,280 --> 03:14:59,280
And she's like, I love that the characters in that game are just great

1965
03:15:00,280 --> 03:15:02,280
British Papa

1966
03:15:02,280 --> 03:15:04,280
Can you do a British chop though?

1967
03:15:06,280 --> 03:15:11,280
I can't really do, like, particular

1968
03:15:13,280 --> 03:15:17,280
Uh, what's it called? Regional accents that well?

1969
03:15:19,280 --> 03:15:23,280
It's like, I can be either really posh or really Londoner

1970
03:15:24,280 --> 03:15:26,280
Like, oh, bro, you want a tussle, yeah?

1971
03:15:26,280 --> 03:15:29,280
Well, you know, I see a fit bird out there

1972
03:15:29,280 --> 03:15:32,280
And I said, you know, I'm a bagger, I'm a pull this fit bird

1973
03:15:32,280 --> 03:15:34,280
And then you swooped in, bro

1974
03:15:34,280 --> 03:15:36,280
And you just took a rifle under me

1975
03:15:36,280 --> 03:15:39,280
And I fucking hate you for that, you're fucking bloody wanker for that

1976
03:15:39,280 --> 03:15:40,280
That's all I'm gonna say, bro

1977
03:15:40,280 --> 03:15:42,280
That's all I'm gonna say

1978
03:15:44,280 --> 03:15:47,280
Went Scottish there, I did, sometimes I'll go Scottish

1979
03:15:48,280 --> 03:15:51,280
The way I go Scottish is I'll either say

1980
03:15:52,280 --> 03:15:56,280
If you had the chance to change your fate, would ya?

1981
03:15:56,280 --> 03:15:59,280
Or what are you doing in my swamp?

1982
03:15:59,280 --> 03:16:02,280
Or I'll say, um, reeflings

1983
03:16:04,280 --> 03:16:06,280
I just channel scrawny

1984
03:16:07,280 --> 03:16:09,280
Yeah, I just sound like a roadman, yeah

1985
03:16:09,280 --> 03:16:10,280
Yeah

1986
03:16:13,280 --> 03:16:15,280
Okay, what did you say?

1987
03:16:20,280 --> 03:16:22,280
Am I being hit on by, uh

1988
03:16:24,280 --> 03:16:25,280
Skull in forever

1989
03:16:27,280 --> 03:16:30,280
I can't do, would ya know

1990
03:16:30,280 --> 03:16:33,280
I can't do a Australian accent, though

1991
03:16:33,280 --> 03:16:36,280
I can't really do it, no, oh, no

1992
03:16:36,280 --> 03:16:39,280
I need to like listen to Aimee more

1993
03:16:39,280 --> 03:16:43,280
Absolutely, sometimes like during our Left 4 Dead 2 collab

1994
03:16:43,280 --> 03:16:45,280
With Aimee and Reia in Azura

1995
03:16:45,280 --> 03:16:47,280
I literally just sat there and I would be quiet

1996
03:16:47,280 --> 03:16:50,280
Because I wanted to listen to Aimee talk so I could emulate her voice

1997
03:16:51,280 --> 03:16:54,280
One time recently I was in the shower

1998
03:16:54,280 --> 03:16:58,280
And I was listening to, uh, I think like a Neander's clip

1999
03:16:58,280 --> 03:17:02,280
And I would just, I would, I'm a freak, guys

2000
03:17:02,280 --> 03:17:05,280
I was just sitting, standing in the shower, brushing out my hair

2001
03:17:05,280 --> 03:17:06,280
You know, doing what I'm doing

2002
03:17:06,280 --> 03:17:08,280
And then Neander's would say something

2003
03:17:08,280 --> 03:17:11,280
And I just would try to say in the same exact voice

2004
03:17:18,280 --> 03:17:20,280
Uh, hi everyone

2005
03:17:20,280 --> 03:17:21,280
Hi, hi

2006
03:17:21,280 --> 03:17:25,280
I, um, I can't, she like kinda goes to the front of it

2007
03:17:25,280 --> 03:17:27,280
And it's kind of in the back of it

2008
03:17:27,280 --> 03:17:29,280
I can't even do it right now

2009
03:17:30,280 --> 03:17:32,280
And I've tried to do like Shia Lily's voice

2010
03:17:43,280 --> 03:17:46,280
Shimi, I don't really want you to leave, but no, you need to go pack, fuck, you're right

2011
03:17:50,280 --> 03:17:52,280
Listen to laser beam for this truly an accident

2012
03:17:53,280 --> 03:17:56,280
Come on, come on, yeah

2013
03:17:56,280 --> 03:17:59,280
I need to, I'm trying to work on it

2014
03:17:59,280 --> 03:18:02,280
Yeah, I just really want to be able to voice act and do cool impressions

2015
03:18:02,280 --> 03:18:05,280
Like fuckin' Elizabeth Bloodflame

2016
03:18:07,280 --> 03:18:10,280
Uh, I really, if I listen to, if you give me a voice

2017
03:18:10,280 --> 03:18:13,280
Like I figured out I can do Kiara's voice

2018
03:18:13,280 --> 03:18:15,280
And I can do Mori Kaliope's voice

2019
03:18:15,280 --> 03:18:17,280
So that's interesting

2020
03:18:18,280 --> 03:18:20,280
Now you're not free, you're just dedicated to VA

2021
03:18:20,280 --> 03:18:22,280
Also I knew a girl who stayed out two hours in the shower

2022
03:18:22,280 --> 03:18:24,280
Cause she has a bathtub markers to meet art in the shower

2023
03:18:24,280 --> 03:18:26,280
That's actually kinda cool

2024
03:18:26,280 --> 03:18:28,280
I didn't know that was a thing

2025
03:18:34,280 --> 03:18:38,280
Yeah, she's a fucking god for that

2026
03:18:40,280 --> 03:18:43,280
Um, for her, for her impressions

2027
03:18:44,280 --> 03:18:47,280
Uh, yeah, I was trying to do, like I was trying to figure out how to do

2028
03:18:47,280 --> 03:18:51,280
I think I can do Doki Bird's voice too

2029
03:18:51,280 --> 03:18:54,280
I realized one time when I was watching her a lot

2030
03:18:54,280 --> 03:18:58,280
Uh, and one of my streams, this is one of my, my appeal

2031
03:18:58,280 --> 03:19:01,280
I realized I was accidentally talking like her

2032
03:19:01,280 --> 03:19:05,280
Because I just, I have echolalia, so like when I listen to something

2033
03:19:05,280 --> 03:19:08,280
Enough, I just start to mimic it and replicate it

2034
03:19:08,280 --> 03:19:11,280
And I was like doing her laugh

2035
03:19:11,280 --> 03:19:15,280
And I was like, I can't do it right now

2036
03:19:15,280 --> 03:19:17,280
I don't have the laugh down

2037
03:19:17,280 --> 03:19:21,280
Again, I have to listen to a voice and repeat it constantly

2038
03:19:21,280 --> 03:19:26,280
And I don't, I don't listen to the VTubers enough

2039
03:19:26,280 --> 03:19:29,280
That I want to learn imitations of, that I can just do it on command

2040
03:19:29,280 --> 03:19:32,280
I literally have to listen to a voice clip and then I can get into it

2041
03:19:33,280 --> 03:19:35,280
I could probably do Kobo's voice, actually

2042
03:19:35,280 --> 03:19:37,280
I'm not gonna, cause I can go that high

2043
03:19:37,280 --> 03:19:43,280
Like I can do, I can do Fuwawa Mokoko

2044
03:19:43,280 --> 03:19:47,280
Cause I can go that high

2045
03:19:47,280 --> 03:19:51,280
I, I realized I can do higher voices better than I can do lower voices

2046
03:19:51,280 --> 03:19:55,280
Which doesn't make any sense, cause my voice is naturally in a lower register

2047
03:19:55,280 --> 03:19:57,280
So I don't, I don't get that

2048
03:19:59,280 --> 03:20:00,280
Why?

2049
03:20:00,280 --> 03:20:02,280
I literally made a friend crap himself

2050
03:20:02,280 --> 03:20:05,280
I dressed up as a slender man and then he was, what?

2051
03:20:07,280 --> 03:20:09,280
Off topic, but okay

2052
03:20:10,280 --> 03:20:12,280
It's a lack of an Adam's apple

2053
03:20:18,280 --> 03:20:21,280
Yes, I 100% have more control of my head voice in Volsetto

2054
03:20:21,280 --> 03:20:23,280
Yes, I definitely do

2055
03:20:38,280 --> 03:20:43,280
Cause they're like, they, like, so there's a lot of VTubers that are like, breathe out a lot when they're talking

2056
03:20:43,280 --> 03:20:48,280
They go, like I noticed when I was trying to mimic Neanna's voice

2057
03:20:48,280 --> 03:20:52,280
She talks out and she breathes out like this

2058
03:20:52,280 --> 03:20:59,280
And when she, she gets a little bit high cause she has a naturally soft and higher voice

2059
03:20:59,280 --> 03:21:01,280
But I can't, but she like, breathes out

2060
03:21:02,280 --> 03:21:05,280
At least you don't practice your belting

2061
03:21:05,280 --> 03:21:07,280
Yeah, I don't think my neighbors would like that

2062
03:21:10,280 --> 03:21:17,280
Sounds like a mix of mocha kawawa, yeah, right, cause I need to listen to them to really like, again, to be able to do it

2063
03:21:19,280 --> 03:21:23,280
And like, and Shy Lily's is in the back of the throat

2064
03:21:24,280 --> 03:21:26,280
Hi, I can't, I can't even fucking do it

2065
03:21:26,280 --> 03:21:31,280
I like how she speaks like that, that's me, I know, right?

2066
03:21:31,280 --> 03:21:36,280
I love, VTubers have such interesting voices because a lot of them are voice actors themselves

2067
03:21:36,280 --> 03:21:41,280
And, you know, they became popular because they have very distinct, unique voices

2068
03:21:41,280 --> 03:21:46,280
For example, Doki Bird has such a distinct and unique laugh and that's just something

2069
03:21:46,280 --> 03:21:51,280
One of the things that made her so lovable was her such, she has such a cute laugh

2070
03:21:52,280 --> 03:22:00,280
And so it's so fun to mimic VTubers voices because they're all so very different and like, very unique

2071
03:22:00,280 --> 03:22:09,280
Me, I just, I kind of, again, I've gotten compared to like, like a deeper Maury, Calliope before

2072
03:22:11,280 --> 03:22:16,280
And like some other VTubers because I speak in a kind of a deeper register

2073
03:22:17,280 --> 03:22:21,280
Got a Master of Gen Maids, I can do Icy

2074
03:22:22,280 --> 03:22:27,280
Hi everybody, it's Icy Snowpaws

2075
03:22:27,280 --> 03:22:33,280
Today we're going to be doing some Guild Wars

2076
03:22:34,280 --> 03:22:36,280
I love my Dadas

2077
03:22:36,280 --> 03:22:53,280
My Icy is good, she has a little bit of vibration and then you just have to do some like a European accent

2078
03:22:54,280 --> 03:23:08,280
Um, and I don't know if I can do Amy's voice

2079
03:23:08,280 --> 03:23:12,280
I have to listen to Amy's voice to do it

2080
03:23:12,280 --> 03:23:16,280
I'm trying to think of like, I'm trying to repeat her voice in my head right now

2081
03:23:17,280 --> 03:23:20,280
I can go as high as Amy

2082
03:23:20,280 --> 03:23:24,280
And then I can be a Zara Dule

2083
03:23:24,280 --> 03:23:30,280
I'm working on a Zara's voice because she has a breathy voice

2084
03:23:30,280 --> 03:23:34,280
But I can't seem to get her Lisp down because she has a Lisp, but I don't notice it

2085
03:23:34,280 --> 03:23:40,280
And then Zara was just like, no, I do have a Lisp, I'm like, I don't pick up on it, so I can't do that

2086
03:23:40,280 --> 03:23:48,280
Um, it's a decent, I mean, yeah, no, I can 100% get Amy's voice

2087
03:23:48,280 --> 03:23:51,280
I will just need to practice

2088
03:23:51,280 --> 03:23:55,280
Um, Skinwalker skills

2089
03:23:55,280 --> 03:24:00,280
Is Vela actually, no, actually we're all strongies personas

2090
03:24:00,280 --> 03:24:02,280
I'm strongy

2091
03:24:02,280 --> 03:24:06,280
Are you fucking kidding me right now?

2092
03:24:06,280 --> 03:24:11,280
I can't even, she has a little bit

2093
03:24:11,280 --> 03:24:17,280
So, so, so, so I was wondering if, no, I have to listen to her voice

2094
03:24:17,280 --> 03:24:20,280
Are you squiddin' me right now?

2095
03:24:20,280 --> 03:24:22,280
Are you squiddin' me right now?

2096
03:24:22,280 --> 03:24:25,280
Yeah, that sounded like I see, it's because I still have Icy's voice in my head

2097
03:24:28,280 --> 03:24:31,280
Yeah, I'm trying to get Mercy's laugh down

2098
03:24:32,280 --> 03:24:34,280
I can't even do it

2099
03:24:34,280 --> 03:24:43,280
So, so, so, so, I have to like, I don't even, because Mercy's voice is similar to mine in terms of like

2100
03:24:45,280 --> 03:24:48,280
She's like a little bit higher than mine

2101
03:24:50,280 --> 03:24:52,280
Yeah, Mercy's laugh is in the chest

2102
03:25:01,280 --> 03:25:06,280
Yeah

2103
03:25:10,280 --> 03:25:13,280
What took you so long to come back, granddaughter?

2104
03:25:15,280 --> 03:25:17,280
Bye, thank you

2105
03:25:18,280 --> 03:25:20,280
Mercy's fill-

2106
03:25:20,280 --> 03:25:22,280
Yeah

2107
03:25:28,280 --> 03:25:33,280
Imagine a whole VTuber company that's just in person with multiple personas

2108
03:25:33,280 --> 03:25:40,280
I am, I think there's actually a company that's a VTuber like that

2109
03:25:40,280 --> 03:25:49,280
I know like, Alias has her two little like ghosty friends that she does voices for, which is very impressive

2110
03:25:49,280 --> 03:25:53,280
And then I believe that Clotho, who just debuted in

2111
03:25:58,280 --> 03:26:02,280
Mythos is actually technically playing three people

2112
03:26:04,280 --> 03:26:06,280
So it's pretty cool

2113
03:26:07,280 --> 03:26:09,280
Collabs would be tricky

2114
03:26:13,280 --> 03:26:16,280
I think there's a running joint, the floor, because everybody in his closet

2115
03:26:16,280 --> 03:26:18,280
That is funny

2116
03:26:19,280 --> 03:26:21,280
Oh

2117
03:26:25,280 --> 03:26:29,280
I'll leave in three minutes, I'll leave in three minutes, let me find someone to read

2118
03:26:32,280 --> 03:26:34,280
Oh, Strony is playing, yeah, I'll read Strony

2119
03:26:35,280 --> 03:26:43,280
She's playing supermarket simulator, I hope she isn't fucking hiking up her prices or something

2120
03:26:44,280 --> 03:26:46,280
I didn't know

2121
03:26:47,280 --> 03:26:53,280
Strony is very impressed with how far along my Scottish accent has come since I first spoke to her

2122
03:26:58,280 --> 03:27:01,280
Now because I since I talk to her more often

2123
03:27:03,280 --> 03:27:08,280
Well, my neck isn't quite on my body, hold on, let me lean back when I lean forward

2124
03:27:17,280 --> 03:27:23,280
Wait, is Strony not streaming? Was that, what the heck?

2125
03:27:28,280 --> 03:27:30,280
Am I tripping?

2126
03:27:31,280 --> 03:27:35,280
Was that just like an old thing? Was that old?

2127
03:27:37,280 --> 03:27:40,280
Strony rated me, you're right, I don't know why

2128
03:27:42,280 --> 03:27:44,280
I don't know why that just

2129
03:27:47,280 --> 03:27:49,280
What the hell?

2130
03:27:50,280 --> 03:27:53,280
It didn't reflect on my screen that she stopped streaming

2131
03:27:54,280 --> 03:27:57,280
I'm so, I'm tired, leave me alone, leave me alone

2132
03:27:58,280 --> 03:28:01,280
See, that's why I put that there, that's why I put that thing there

2133
03:28:04,280 --> 03:28:06,280
Oh wait, Phoenix, I didn't see that, $20 tip

2134
03:28:06,280 --> 03:28:11,280
Check her out, CB, not just on the 10k, but on all the other dreams that are and will be coming true

2135
03:28:11,280 --> 03:28:14,280
Oh, thank you, Phoenix

2136
03:28:15,280 --> 03:28:17,280
So kind, thank you so much

2137
03:28:18,280 --> 03:28:22,280
It's because I don't have the donor alerts on because I'm in my ASMR scene

2138
03:28:25,280 --> 03:28:28,280
Let's see, let's see there

2139
03:28:29,280 --> 03:28:34,280
Let me find a real Bonnie Lassie for ya

2140
03:28:35,280 --> 03:28:37,280
Let's go outside the Corpo

2141
03:28:38,280 --> 03:28:40,280
Let's find someone real cute

2142
03:28:41,280 --> 03:28:45,280
