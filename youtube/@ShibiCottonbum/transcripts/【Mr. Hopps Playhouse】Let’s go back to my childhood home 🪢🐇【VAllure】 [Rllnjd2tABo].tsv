381800	388960	Well, I didn't black out. No, it was not that bad not at all. It's more so like I got distracted. I

476040	481440	And I know my British fans out there would be horrified to hear that I microwaved my tea
481440	484840	It's just easy to just throw it in there for like a minute 30 and I'm good
485040	487040	But now I have a nice tea kettle

700480	706080	Just how you can manipulate like an online talent as her like manager
706920	708920	Very very interesting
709360	714000	And it's like just brings a whole new perspective to like how men head up
715160	717160	Women can be
718040	723960	Um overdosing did oh doki-doki literature club is literally one of my favorite games of all time

805600	806920	um
806920	808200	strong
808200	812800	You know what strong you should do she should just run our voices through an AI
813800	820120	Just oh, I need I need so and so to do this and then she's like types it in the generator now
820600	826400	Just like if we're not around her for a sleep. I believe you replace the AI. Oh god. I hope not
827400	828640	Oh
828640	834520	although an AI an AI whore, I mean woman of the night
836400	838400	That'd be pretty hard

867920	869920	Robo waifu
869920	871320	monster
871320	873320	ogre lady
874160	876160	It's just because
876400	878400	Oh
878680	886120	But just it's so fun having like gen mates that like have the same taste as you and even if they don't have the same taste
886120	893320	You're just like oh, okay. I see where you're coming from. That's that's a pretty good idea. Okay, very cultured
893320	898680	Yeah, yeah, platypus girl. She can lay eggs, but then give me
898680	900680	No
902760	904760	Dress up as there as a platypus
906200	912280	Although did you am I allowed to talk about like my spicy all or like other girls spicy? Oh, I don't know
912280	914120	I will figure it out
914120	920160	But is there I made some beautiful art on her all so good. I hope she finishes it a wombat girl
920160	922160	I like to call rain on a wombat and
924360	926360	Did you know that like
927360	929360	I'm like that
930880	935440	Should I be saying this that breast milk tastes very sweet
942440	944440	One of my
944440	946440	friends had a baby
946880	951200	Recently and she's like she be and I'm like, yeah, she's like
952000	955000	You keep looking at the baby's bottle
956360	961840	Do you want a taste and I'm like straight from the source and she's like we were just we were joking
961840	966580	We were joking. She's like here and she's just like put some out like in a little like shot glass for me
966920	968920	so I did
969560	971860	My friends breast milk and I'm just like
976480	978480	Wow that is surprisingly good
981040	985880	Well then like it makes sense because it has all this like nourishment and all this like whatever stuff
986400	993160	And I'm like that's some that's some good stuff right there. So if Azura ever made like a
994560	996560	Like a milk based
997160	1002160	Like merch item like she starts selling her own like blue milk like and it's
1002760	1004760	Azura do lay
1004760	1006760	This is like I
1008200	1010700	Wouldn't be a verse to try again 100%
1011540	1013540	Um
1013900	1018900	She be you've been streaming for five days and you've tased chat
1019260	1026700	You've talked about drinking breast milk. You don't many suspicious things on stream if anyone's getting like
1028300	1032100	Demonetized or their channel terminated first. It's probably gonna be me
1032500	1034500	I
1034980	1039820	Sir impression is so good. Yeah, she has like a really
1041380	1043820	Sing song II dragged out
1044900	1046900	like voice
1046940	1053860	It's like she's thinking but then she also kind of has like a valet girl accent at the same
1053860	1058060	It's really like she'll be like, oh my no, she doesn't say oh my gosh at all. I don't know
1058060	1060060	I
1060340	1063980	Take you to management to the dungeon. Yeah, nah, and we would win
1068980	1073700	Oh, I can one up that I can one up in all of that. Should I be wanting up in me?
1076060	1078060	So one time
1078540	1085500	In another era of she be I was streaming some lovely games with my with one of my friends
1086220	1091700	Toma you might know Toma keys and um, we were playing. I know we were doing
1092860	1095620	We were doing smash your pass on Pokemon
1098100	1099860	And um
1099860	1106260	So I I had eaten something. I think like I got like food poisoning. So I'm sitting there
1106260	1112460	I'm like, oh my god, like I really have to use the bathroom like if I fart like it's not gonna be good
1112820	1113980	Um
1113980	1120340	So I'm sitting and we're laughing and I'm about to be like, oh, let me I'm just gonna be or be real quick to run to
1120340	1124580	The bathroom and then we get a raid of like four hundred people
1128100	1130100	And I'm like, oh
1130140	1133300	Hi everyone, welcome to the stream
1133300	1139580	Oh, we're just we're just talking about Pokemon and I'm like trying so hard not to fart
1139940	1145300	And then I'm like, I'm sad as I said the guys guys you don't even I sat there for like 10 minutes
1146140	1148140	fighting for my life
1148180	1152420	Waiting for like I just wanted people to leave at that point like though
1155020	1159140	Because like I being a small stripper I was like, oh, I need to keep up the momentum
1159140	1163420	I need to I can't just like leave when they rate some is like, oh, you know what I
1164340	1166340	Will shit myself right now
1167340	1169340	Maintain the numbers
1171260	1179420	Like oh, yes, let me continue to talk about how I would smash how I wouldn't smash any bird Pokemon because it's a fucking
1182180	1188820	But no, it was fine, I didn't you know, I can't one up in me because I didn't actually shit myself but afterwards I
1190340	1192340	Did like
1192500	1194500	Low-pony can get it. Um, I
1195340	1197340	Did fight for my life on the bathroom
1198380	1204940	Sorry for the TMI, but you know as I mentioned I had a therapist point this appointment this morning
1204940	1206940	And I was like talking about you guys so
1207620	1209940	Like I said, I'm at all it's serious. So
1211220	1213220	You know
1213860	1218780	We had like you thought you were being parasol. No, I'm already talking to my therapist about you
1218780	1219380	It was like, oh my god
1220220	1227700	And it was great and like I had to send my therapist a bunch of stuff about vTubers just cuz she doesn't know what they are
1228380	1230780	It's moving too quickly. No, it's not moving fast enough
1231620	1233180	and
1233180	1237980	She's like, oh my gosh, I'm so proud of you because she knows I've been working towards being like a full-time streamer
1239660	1246060	No, you're not the abuse abuse of boyfriend. You're the sweetest you the sweetest little subby boyfriend a girl could ask for
1246820	1248020	Um
1248020	1254220	But so I told her so she she doesn't know like the full extent of like the content I make
1255260	1257260	Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if she was watching me right now
1258140	1260140	Hi, Cheryl
1260780	1262500	But
1262500	1264940	She uh, I told her like
1265980	1272700	So I told her that my outfit is risque cuz she's like, oh, I told her that I got merch merch plug. Ooh market
1273500	1279860	And she's like, oh, I want to buy your merch and I'm like, I I don't think you should
1280500	1285260	Because I don't think I want and she's like this really sweet older woman. She's like
1286260	1289420	Middle-aged and she's she's like, let me support you
1289420	1293780	I don't like I feel like that's a breach of stuff, but I don't like she's been with me for years
1293980	1295860	so but I'm like
1295860	1297860	You should probably get a key chain
1298300	1303540	It not the shirt cuz she's like, I want a shirt. I'm like, I don't think you want a bondage bunny on a shirt
1307260	1312820	Yeah, I don't want some rude ain't wearing outside, you know what I don't even your support is all them like that's just
1313660	1316380	You don't have to wear it out. That's okay. If you rep me
1317300	1318820	honestly
1318820	1324260	Hell to the yeah, I don't even think I can wear my own merch outside because I just
1325020	1331020	Something deep down just tells me I'd be identified if I'm wearing my merch and then I like go to like
1331940	1335780	CVS or something and then I'm like, hey, I'd like to get like
1336500	1338500	Some a pack of gum and they're just like
1338940	1341660	She be caught in by like I just feel like I would be
1342660	1345700	Noticed it's happened before I've had
1347540	1353300	When I was a flesh tuber someone I was working at my normal day job and someone's just like are you?
1353940	1355540	redacted and I'm like
1355540	1357380	No
1357380	1361180	They're just like wow you look exactly like her and I'm like wow, that's crazy
1362220	1364380	Anyways, did you want to buy anything else?
1367220	1369220	That's something that happened at the target
1370100	1371700	Yeah
1371700	1379140	And like even like I'm nervous to like say like oh I went to this place today because I'm like there is somebody out
1379140	1384060	There that will figure out exactly what store I'm at and be like triangulate my location
1386060	1388860	And then they'll see me be like oh my god, she's a rat and I'll be like
1390340	1392340	Yeah, I'm you I'm you oh she right
1394860	1400620	Redacted as my favorite streamer. Oh, yeah, I was a lot more based back then and politically incorrect
1400620	1404060	That's for sure being a former commentary youtuber
1404940	1412940	Immersion broken redacted is that honestly that would be a cool name for a streamer. Hey, what's up? I'm redacted. He just called her Daki. Oh
1416060	1423460	I got gen 2 a vtuber that's just covered in sensor bars and her name is redacted
1425340	1427660	Her outfit is made out of sensor bars
1429020	1431660	You had flesh. No never flesh
1432660	1434660	You know Daki Daki
1435700	1440220	Right, that's not a bad idea. She's like she's like a what's it called?

1763540	1767860	You may plus girls. Oh, well, yeah, like anybody that's like debuted recently
1768020	1771900	That's in an agency. I've watched and even some indies. It's just fun
1771900	1777780	Like I like getting to know people. I just I just sit quietly in the chat though. I don't say anything cuz I'm too shy
1778740	1780740	Yeah, I watched like um
1780900	1788020	Like before Mariah's debuts. Oh, those were so good. Like there's so many talented people in the community
1789860	1791860	So
1791860	1793860	Sorry
1797060	1802340	Mmm, yeah, like there's just like a lot of cool. Like I watched like mono and um
1803220	1805220	and alias and
1805540	1810740	Nova and stuff they're like the v4 mariah girls so creative and so where the in the pixel like girls

1816260	1819060	Like uh, chio or I'll watch, um
1820260	1822660	Me and uh, I can never pronounce anybody's names though. Um
1824420	1826420	Erlotte
1826500	1829060	But yeah talented talented yappers. Yes
1829700	1832900	Did you watch for the debuts for this new company called velar? Nah
1833620	1835620	Mean valier. Nah
1837620	1840660	No, yeah, I technically I watched our debuts like three times
1841300	1843940	Because we had to do we did some um test runs
1845540	1847540	Japanese
1847780	1853380	You're doing a summer art mind. Oh, yeah, go ahead. Thank you. I mean visaki. Yeah, then, you know, you mean visaki
1854100	1856100	You mean visaki
1858740	1860740	Okay, let's see
1860980	1862980	I think that's good
1863940	1869460	All the debuts stuff went so smoothly a test run. Oh, yeah. No, I really did it really did we prepared really hard
1870100	1874020	Um, it was really fun though. Just like the first time we did a test run
1874420	1879380	So we were like, okay, we'll meet for like three hours to be like to you know, the normal length of our debuts
1880500	1883380	We were probably together the entire day
1883460	1884980	I don't know if it was like
1884980	1891620	Five or six or seven hours because we were hysterically laughing at each other because we were just having so much fun
1892100	1893860	And then there'll be like technical issues
1893940	1900100	And so like we would all be in a discord call while we watch one of the girls like stream on a like a unlisted thing
1900980	1902980	And we just be like I remember
1903700	1908900	Like so azura's model has like really good eye tracking for some reason and so you can really see when she goes like
1910740	1912260	When she like shifts her eyes
1912260	1916340	So when she was looking at like um, like her talking points, she would just let be like
1917940	1923060	Anyways, and then like you thought so we were just die laughing every time she looked at her talking points
1923460	1930180	And like you could see it like um in our uh, our two point our no our debut collab where she's like kind of like shifty
1930180	1932180	Eye looking at at icy
1934020	1935380	It was so funny
1935380	1938420	If you sucky debuts are okay except this weird bunny girl, I know right
1939380	1943140	You like the cotton mog girl. Nah, she was my least favorite. She's my least favorite
1943700	1946900	You know the eye tracking is good. We all have iPhones for eye tracking
1948100	1952020	Uh eye tracking with oh my god, there's kids running down the hallway behind me and that just scared me because they're like
1955140	1959060	iPhones are very good for their facial tracking. Um, I would
1959940	1963140	Like and also it's uh, it's also dependent on the rigor like a really good rigor
1964340	1966340	um can
1966580	1968580	Even if you like have a webcam
1968660	1972100	And it could almost make it seem like you're using vbridger because the tracking is just so good
1972500	1974500	So although I I don't have my
1975300	1980420	My model my phone plugged into my computer right now. So I'm going off at wi-fi. So I know my mouth tracking is like
1982740	1984740	You have samsung phone
1985460	1987700	How's how is it when you ruin group chats?
1989140	1993620	You love my hair drills. Yeah, I love my hair drills too because my hair is curly
1993860	1995860	I love curly hair
1996660	1998580	um, but
1998580	2000580	I can't draw my own hair though
2001300	2005220	It's hard to draw my own ringlets. It just looks like weird spaghetti
2008420	2012020	Hair arms for your next outfit. Yeah, I'll just be like one of the the arms characters
2013380	2015780	You love her side. I know is there a side eye is the best
2017140	2021940	As much as I just like apple their cameras are tracking are goaded, you know, it's not even like apples
2022580	2026660	cameras because samsung's cameras have a way higher
2028420	2032260	Like mega pixel amount. It's just like apple has this really good
2033460	2038500	Software for their cameras and I'm like if you married the two of like a samsung camera camera
2038900	2044260	And apple software or like android camera and apple software, then yeah, I am I am an apple fan
2045540	2050180	Um, just because just ease of their ecosystem, but like I do still like android
2050820	2052020	I just
2052020	2055220	For like modding everything, but they just have a terrible user interface
2056180	2060420	One of my friends is an android and I'll be on her phone and I'll be like she'll be like, oh, can you like
2060580	2063140	respond to this text for me? And I'm like, yeah, and I'm like
2064100	2066100	Okay, so how do I go to the homepage?
2068340	2074020	How do I do this to broke for apple stuff on apple stuff is so freaking expensive. It's
2075140	2077140	ridiculous
2077140	2081940	I save I save a save like I because I didn't like they didn't I think they bought phones for the other girls
2082020	2084660	But I already had a phone. I saved for a very long time
2085780	2087300	to and I got
2087300	2089300	I got a 15 coming from a
2090100	2091540	11
2091540	2093540	something or other
2093540	2095540	xr
2096100	2098100	Whatever
2098820	2100820	Although they also like
2101620	2103620	they just
2103620	2108020	I'm not I'm not gonna go rant about apple right now. I'm just like let's just talk about tech and glomerates
2108500	2110500	Incorporations and greed
2113380	2118020	You mean how do I go that I know everything it's when you're used to something like maneuvering around
2118660	2122260	I'm just it's it's hard to like switch and go to the next one because like
2122580	2126420	I have a mac that I used for school and stuff and I do my my assignments on
2127460	2130660	And then but then I stream on a pc and like do everything games on a pc
2131220	2132580	so it's like
2133140	2134260	And so
2134260	2138100	It's annoying on a mac because it like everything scrolls in the opposite direction
2138180	2144500	So like I'll be on my pc and I would like have to like hop on my my mac book and then I'd be like, oh frick
2144660	2146660	How do I work this thing again?
2148100	2154340	Cancel the game we need to deconstruct capitalism. Well, you guys know the vibes I talk for like a yap for a bit
2154580	2156580	And then we get into the game
2157460	2160740	Apart from adding another camera every year we haven't I know
2161380	2163060	Yes, that's so true
2163060	2168340	Like it is it's frustrating for me because I was just like do I even I'm wondering what the 16 will look like like
2168340	2174500	I'm a huge tech head. I'm not gonna lie. Like I like to watch like the keynotes and wwdc and all that stuff
2175140	2179860	Um, just to see what's up and like how things are progressing like I like to see how um
2180820	2184180	Watch I'm gonna call it just like how apple will tackle
2184820	2189780	You know machine learning and AI and all that jazz just because like other like google's already on top of that
2190980	2194580	So it's just really fun. Like I like watching marcus brownlee and just his uh,
2195540	2199860	um breakdowns of stuff and also like other uh youtubers, uh
2201780	2206980	Tear downs I was like care downs. That's not it. They're not caring for the device that they're destroying
2207700	2213700	We yapp we game and yapp and the game and yapp the circle of yapp the circle
2218500	2224020	I know he I just like watching to um marcus brownlee. Why are you so cool? I'm not
2225620	2227620	I'm not cool
2227860	2231060	You just think I'm cool because we have similar interests stop it
2231060	2233060	Yeah
2234580	2236740	I'm a yabbit
2236740	2238580	Yes, I'm very much a yabbit
2238580	2242980	I worked for apple once they actually treated every employee very good in the work life balance pretty great as well
2242980	2248180	But overpriced his understanding. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Um, I had a friend who worked for apple as well
2248340	2254180	They said that it was good. Um, because they like what the heck they got like good benefits and stuff
2254660	2260180	And they like they paid well. So of course like and like retail is um, because they're like or whatever
2260180	2262900	The retail stores or whatever or their customer service calls
2263540	2267860	Like um could be pretty tough, but if like that if you have that and that's that's pretty good like
2268900	2272420	It's good that they treat their employees. Well, although I know like a lot of
2273300	2274420	um
2274420	2279780	tech companies right now are like laying off a lot of people because of everything during coveted
2279780	2284020	So I hope it doesn't seem like apple has been hit with that because I know google's had a lot of layoffs
2284500	2289780	Layoffs and it's because of like I for my what I went to school for although I I'll be honest with you
2289780	2291700	I didn't finish school
2291700	2294580	Because one I am a very indecisive person for my major
2295300	2297140	um, but I
2297140	2301940	So I was going to major in creative writing and then I changed it and then I was going to major in veterinary science
2302020	2305460	And then I changed it and then I was going to major in english because then I changed it
2305860	2308500	And then I was going to major in biology and then I changed it
2309940	2312260	And then I was going to major in um
2313220	2318260	Uh cyber security and then I changed it and then I was going to do it and then I changed it
2318660	2320660	And then I finally settled on
2321300	2323940	Software engineering and then I never finished
2332020	2334020	My parents are not happy with me
2336580	2338580	Oh, yeah, and I almost went to art school
2338740	2344900	How many years oh no, it was only like it was over the course of like three years no biggie
2345700	2346980	it's like
2346980	2351060	like I could go back and finish my software engineering degree, but
2352260	2354260	like I'm like
2354660	2358580	Like I was still in school when I start like a like a couple months ago, but
2359140	2361380	I'll be honest. I wanted to focus on streaming
2361860	2365940	And I know that's probably not the best thing to do, but I was
2366740	2373940	I was just super passionate about fulfilling because I've had dreams of being a content creator. Um since I was a
2376660	2378660	Since when I was
2379140	2381140	I don't know how old was I a wee child
2382180	2384020	In my parents like laughed at me and stuff
2385380	2389700	I remember when I was I used to uh, I was a nice flush tube and uh twitch
2390500	2392500	My mom's like you're gonna get abducted
2392820	2400420	I saw someone say before it was it was yeeted by a mod you failed art school. No, I didn't fail art school
2400580	2404660	I never went to art school. I though I did want to major in illustration
2405060	2407140	Um, but I didn't end up going to art school
2407220	2410580	I want to be with my friends when I should have gone to like a vocational school
2411460	2417860	For because I almost went for like a vocational school for um veterinary medicine, but yeah, my mom was is very uh
2420420	2422420	Not happy with me
2423140	2427060	But when I'm like mom look, I'm streaming. She's but like, you know, my parents
2427060	2431460	They're very supportive of me now because um, I they saw my determination
2432900	2433780	um
2433780	2437380	And my motivation and like, you know, like I still have a day job
2438020	2441380	Um, and I was still going to school while I was streaming but now
2441940	2444660	Since I have VLR. I was like, you know what? Let me put a pause on that
2444900	2448100	You have like I have so much time in the world to finish school, you know
2448980	2450660	Yeah, you can't you can always go back to school
2450660	2454020	You can't join a VTB agency every day a hundred percent. Um
2455060	2456580	and
2456580	2460660	Yeah, then I can save and pay off my school debt that I have accumulated
2463300	2467540	A day job for now. Yeah, like again, I've said it multiple times if I can stream full time that'd be cool
2468100	2469940	like uh, so
2469940	2473940	I do want to yeah, I've already said this before as well. Um the first two weeks
2475220	2476740	of
2476740	2484100	After debut, I am pretty much streaming every day, but it's going to change because I have to go back to my day job
2484740	2491300	Um, so it'll be I'll be honest with you. My stream times may change and be inconsistent. I'll still stream like
2492100	2493620	maybe
2493620	2498260	Like five. Yeah, at least five times a week in like two days off. Um
2499780	2501620	It do me
2501620	2504260	But uh, please don't mind me if school debt it hurts
2505060	2507700	Yeah, do it makes you happy. This brings me joy. This brings me happiness
2508420	2509380	Um
2509380	2514580	And obviously like you need to be realistic and stuff when it like comes to money and like getting a degree and everything
2514580	2519060	But honestly, it feels like a degree meant something 10 years ago. And now it doesn't anymore
2520580	2526020	See like I'm trying to like minimize my burps if you guys are gonna rate me so low. I'm going to go harder with my burps
2527940	2529940	Ever try to cover your burp with a fart
2530820	2532820	And I've tried to cover my fart with a burp
2535060	2536260	Yeah
2536260	2538740	Done in time and so I choose to draw my own type nice nice
2539300	2544420	Sometimes I felt like I feel like it never meant anything. Well, like school. Yeah to the degree
2544900	2546260	That's what I hear
2546260	2553060	Like my parents didn't go to school like my dad never finished college and neither did my mom and then they're but they're very
2553300	2555300	Like my mom if she did go to school
2555300	2562020	She would be running like a fortune 500 company right now like 100. She's such a smart ambitious woman if you want like, you know like like
2562980	2566660	Uh minus like the dying of some unknown disease
2566820	2570580	My mom really reminds me of queen just like and not she didn't
2571060	2572980	Teach me to be a woman of the night
2572980	2578020	But like she's just like this entrepreneurial like really smart like
2578580	2581140	Bad-ass woman and she always wears
2581620	2586820	Work outfits just more appropriately appropriately clothed instead of myself
2587540	2589700	So because like I remember I showed her my model
2590660	2596020	And she's in the lore and everything and she's like, oh my gosh, this reminds me of me. I'm like mom
2602660	2608340	And I didn't show it to my dad. I just I just showed the neck up to my dad because my dad would be like you harlot
2611860	2617300	But mommy, sorry mom, uh woman of the night sounds like a Batman rip off
2617700	2619700	But um
2620660	2624740	No, yeah, like I just I just wanted to do stuff that makes me happy and yapping makes me happy
2625460	2628340	Um, yeah, I can always go back to school. Um
2629460	2633540	I could finish I probably have like two more years left of of school
2634980	2636260	but
2636260	2642740	Excuse your lateness. No terrible somebody flog him mods flog him. I have to fart now though
2642980	2648580	She's just like me for real for real. She'd be small. Yeah, just like it's more so like oh office woman
2648660	2650660	That kind of gets like gypped for a lot of things
2655860	2660740	Um, I didn't know I could have that sort of power thank god that's this that's too that's too funny actually
2661300	2663300	Oh, that's
2667060	2669060	You don't know what you've created
2669060	2671060	She
2678500	2684100	Maybe she had a chapter in her life, you don't know about I highly doubt that my mom is not like that at all
2686260	2688260	I'm in danger
2690100	2692100	Mother merciless
2692820	2694820	Tactical
2696260	2697460	Um

5355540	5360500	We told ruby that she had a fall and she's okay. We're basing on diagnosis. She's crazy
5364340	5366740	Yeah, I'm trying to find the damn tapes
5369940	5372340	Walking back and forth around this house like a motherfucker

5398340	5403060	Ruby was thankful, but I must admit this toy does have a look to it
5403780	5406740	Something quite unsettling
5409300	5412500	That's why we really yeah, my uncle he's coming to you know
5413780	5415780	Take care of the house

5445860	5449460	Toot accomplished, you know what this calls for
5452020	5454020	An uncrossable
5458580	5461540	Like the ASMR you guys didn't even hear it. How can you?
5475620	5477620	Peanut butter and strawberry jam

5488500	5490500	Um
5497700	5499700	If you don't know what uncrossable is it's essentially
5500820	5503540	Two slices of white bread. It's a PB and J
5504180	5507620	Just cut off the corners and seal them and it's a circle
5518260	5520260	Booby is eyeing my uncrossable
5522260	5524260	You can't have any
5537620	5539620	Just a wee snack
5540580	5542580	I
5544180	5549620	I've only had to waffle and uncrossable today. I should probably have something protein or veggie based
5553540	5557060	Are they better than just making one? Yes, the bread is so soft and
5557700	5559700	Definitely unhealthy for you
5559860	5562900	strawberry toaster's drool. I haven't had toaster's drool since I was
5564020	5566020	Unnugget

5968820	5971460	She said it protects her from it. It's just a toy
5971860	5977380	We've had to lock the slingshot away since ruby kept finding it jenna keeps the key under a houseplant in the hallway. I think

6021460	6023460	Hello
6027380	6032420	I'm literally pressing everything. Oh my god. I got it
6033780	6036260	Okay, but then now where
6037300	6039300	is
6039300	6044820	Like where is it stored? He didn't say where it was stored. Yeah journal pages would make more sense
6050580	6052900	Fuck fuck
6056900	6063300	I'm assuming it's back in their bedroom
6067060	6071620	Go go. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. I ran out of shit
6079460	6082660	Okay, but there's a fucking safe in here
6083380	6085380	Huh
6094180	6096900	Oh, April 18th
6104340	6108180	Big brain what? Hello
6108580	6111940	I press the wrong button
6115300	6118740	Please oh wait, they're British. Maybe it might go in the opposite direction
6128180	6130180	Okay, well
6130580	6132580	Ah
6139140	6142820	British time British is not the proper way
6146580	6148900	That's dumb. Oh, can I shoot him?
6150980	6152980	Wait, how do I shoot?
6152980	6156740	I fucked up the controls. I had to use the other thing I had to use
6156740	6158740	Oh
6160900	6162900	Oh
6163940	6165940	Okay, let's go
6168260	6170260	Fuck you
6174980	6177620	I got this this is where the game begins
6179300	6181700	In the early version of the game it was a gun
6187540	6189940	She just gets a fucking gun
6195540	6200660	Oh, where is he where is he come here, bitch
6202260	6206020	I'm ready for you. It's hard to these controls
6217300	6219300	Oh
6222100	6224100	This is very tense
6231620	6235620	What I don't understand about this game is that
6237220	6239220	I don't know how the how the
6239940	6242740	Game mechanic works because you know like a 3d game like you know
6242740	6246580	There can be rooms like stacked on each other that you go through and that's how you progress like um
6247460	6251300	But like I'm wondering why can I hear the monster right here?
6251300	6253460	Is there like technically another part of this?
6254340	6256340	Where he's on the other side
6256340	6258340	like I don't
6259860	6262360	Is another room that just does it oh
6269220	6271220	It's so fucking tense
6276740	6278740	You
6285140	6290500	Objective kill mr. Hopps she got the Glock. Yeah, I mean it's probably the basement
6299540	6301540	I have a sneeze again
6301620	6307780	Well now I know he does not gonna come so I don't really care
6312180	6321460	Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Oh, what I couldn't leave
6329060	6331060	All right
6332100	6334100	I
6335700	6341060	Need a jump shot. Oh, maybe maybe I do need a jump shot. Yeah
6343140	6345140	Yeah
6346500	6348500	Go for his ankles
6355220	6358340	I don't know I think I'm too short
6362260	6364260	I think I'm too short
6368740	6370740	Because I can't go back up
6376180	6378180	Is my game bugging again
6379140	6381140	Oh
6387300	6389300	Am I hmm, maybe
6390500	6392820	Okay, I'll I'll I'll test y'all's theory
6393780	6398260	So you see the little red because there's a cool you can't see it past me because my head is fucking huge
6398260	6400260	But there's a cool down
6400740	6402740	Um meter
6408180	6410180	I
6410740	6412740	Can't
6416180	6418340	I didn't do anything different that time
6422340	6424340	I didn't do anything different
6426180	6428180	All I did was
6428660	6431300	Do I have to like start up here and then I don't
6433940	6435940	Might get make sense
6436660	6443220	Can I call for help? Nope. Oh, what the fuck are the controls again?
6450740	6452740	Oh
6453860	6455860	Why is it saying that
6458260	6463220	Weird I don't know why it's acting like I can do something. Can I leave now?
6465940	6467940	No, I don't want to give my nana a big kiss
6471780	6473780	It's time to kill nana
6474740	6476740	Fuck you nana. Oh
6476740	6477940	Fuck you
6477940	6479940	Fuck you fuck
6483300	6485300	Nope, I'm good
6490260	6492260	Oh god
6492260	6494260	Oh
6495460	6497460	Okay
6502020	6504520	What police stay where you are
6511220	6513220	What the fuck
6513220	6515220	I
6531220	6533220	I
6533220	6538980	It seems like you guys are just as confused as me how I escaped when they grabbed me
6539300	6547140	That doesn't make any sense. Can I replay that?
6549620	6551620	I'm replaying that
6566180	6568180	I can't go any faster
6569460	6571460	I
6571860	6573860	Can't even like get out of this
6578980	6580980	They don't even explain
6582900	6588900	Why the police were there shoot the hand what if you fought instead of escaping okay, let's try it
6594580	6596580	But it says to run though
6598980	6600980	I
6604980	6606980	Yeah, I don't I don't think that works
6608660	6610740	Maybe your neighbor called them. Oh, that makes sense
6613540	6616100	You shift to that's what I've been using shift to spread
6618100	6620100	I read yours like chef that's right
6620740	6622740	I
6625700	6632340	Didn't notice that three times that I did that. Okay, let's try to outrun the thingy my barber
6650740	6652740	I
6659620	6661620	It's weird the first time
6661700	6665860	That I got put in the situation the hand didn't spawn for a really long time
6665940	6669140	And that was the only reason I was caught because I thought I could turn around and shoot at it
6669140	6671140	And that's why I paused for a bit the first time
6672020	6673860	So I don't know
6673860	6677620	The game obviously is bucky, but it's like a you know, it's like just an indie game
6677940	6680740	I'll try one more time. I'm gonna make it
6702100	6704100	It's the same ending
6708500	6711220	Was it my grandma? Was she possessed? I don't
6720980	6722980	Okay
6724340	6726340	All right
6728020	6730020	Nice
6730020	6744020	Anything past the door, I don't think so. Well, this game is what hold on. Let me see how old it is
6747060	6749060	It came out in 2019
6752900	6754900	This thing is very positive
6760980	6767780	Achievements are broken somebody said oh someone else said you get capped like it is the same ending
6769380	6771380	And then it makes zero sense
6771780	6773780	Yes
6774740	6779460	Thumbs up haha British funny. Okay, so it seems like it's supposed to be like that
6780900	6783060	Thought there was an ending where you burned down the house
6784420	6786420	What
6790100	6798100	The other ending is a secret ending they made a prequel. Yeah, I know there's a second one
6800900	6802900	I'm like I'm playing the free one though
6805620	6811620	What's this there's an ending where I burned down the house, what do you well now I'm looking up a walk through
6813060	6815540	Don't mind if I do
6820740	6822740	I
6837380	6843780	Plus collect the first tape then you go back to the kitchen and you get lighter fluid
6850980	6854100	After you collected all the tapes find the slingshot then shoot
6854580	6859380	Mr. Hop six times go left shoot a pot on the side table that is near you and you get a box of matches
6860100	6864260	You see some pieces of paper once you're staying on the piece of paper press e or z to set them on fire
6869220	6874820	That is so elaborate for no reason and I like spammed everything in the kitchen after I got the first tape
6876260	6878500	I didn't see any of the lighter fluid
6880980	6882980	I
6883380	6890500	Yeah, people said that it also wouldn't let them light the paper. Okay. Well, I'm not gonna I'm not gonna bother playing through all that
6893860	6898660	Got the arson, but yeah ending those already. Yeah, it seems like you have to I'd have to like start
6898660	6901620	I'm like, I don't feel like doing all that. I don't feel like doing all that
6910900	6912100	Oh
6912100	6916340	Hold on let me move over a bit and we can chat a bit
6916820	6919060	That's a little wee cheeky chat in it
6919780	6924180	It's juice. Oh, no, it's not Tuesday. Tuesday's yesterday and I didn't even say it's juicy in it
6924820	6925860	dumb
