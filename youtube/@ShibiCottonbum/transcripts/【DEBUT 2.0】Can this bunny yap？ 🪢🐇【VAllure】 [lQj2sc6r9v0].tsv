439620	469620	trabaj   review
469620	482620	but I was so excited for this project from the moment of its inception and I even said that in my video
482620	490620	I was like, I just want to be a part of this. I just want to be part of something different.
490620	495620	I want to be part of this company that's going to make waves.
495620	500620	I want to be part of this company that's going to set a whole new standard for V-Tubing
500620	506620	and I hope that we do. I know it's only been, it's only my second day out here
506620	516620	but part of V-SUCKY. Hi, welcome to V-SUCKY. We'll give you some SUCKY SUCKY.
516620	532620	I was very excited to be a part of this in my interview with...
532620	539620	So I got the email and it was April's Fool's Day and I'm just like, this is a joke.
539620	544620	Somehow someone figured out that I applied because I kept it on the DL
544620	549620	and they sent me a joke email but it wasn't.
549620	557620	And then I had the interview and then I hear...
557620	562620	and I'm expecting to talk to some run-of-the-mill lady who's just like,
562620	567620	Hey, so you're applying for V-LUR here. I'm going to ask you these questions.
567620	570620	Tell me about yourself, blah blah blah blah blah.
570620	575620	And it was strongy. I was like...
575620	578620	Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
578620	582620	But actually I was pretty... I got my whole... I had questions ready.
582620	586620	I was going in. As you know, I was an office bunny.
586620	590620	I know what I'm getting into. What color is my underwear?
590620	595620	It should be cotton moth. That just sounds like I'm a snake.
595620	599620	Like I'm a... like I'm... I was some sort of... it's going to be a snake.
599620	604620	Like, I'm a shibby cotton moth.
604620	608620	Would you like to be wrapped up in my scales?
608620	610620	Why do I sound like Rita Rapulza?
610620	614620	Um...
614620	617620	Lawmio for Gem 2. Lawmio for Gem 2.
618620	621620	But I heard her voice.
621620	625620	And I was like...
625620	629620	Is that... is that strongy cuttles?
629620	633620	Is that the strongy cuttles?
633620	635620	Excuse me.
635620	638620	The interview was great. She literally was just like, yeah, so you got it.
638620	643620	I'm like, huh? You're joking. And she's like, yeah, that's it.
643620	646620	Okay. Oh, she's like, here's the model.
646620	649620	And I'm like, oh, okay.
649620	652620	And I'm like, do you want to ask me anything?
652620	655620	Like, I could just be... I could be a crazy person.
655620	658620	Like, I could just... you're just gonna...
658620	661620	And she's like, no, you're good.
661620	665620	She's like, you're the person I wanted immediately.
665620	671620	I was like, oh, that's actually like really,
671620	674620	really freaking nice.
674620	677620	It was really nice.
677620	680620	She's been a creator I've looked up to for a very long time.
680620	683620	And I know the other girls can say the same.
683620	690620	And just to hear her be like, you were a first choice.
690620	694620	I was impressed with your video. I was this, I was that.
694620	699620	And I had applied to many companies before.
699620	701620	Because I'm like, I'm never going to get in.
701620	703620	I'm just going to do whatever.
703620	708620	I applied to, I think, 10 different auditions.
708620	712620	And I'm generally happy I failed each one.
712620	715620	Because I wouldn't want this any other way.
715620	718620	It was great.
718620	722620	And me knows what I'm talking about.
722620	726620	And meeting all the girls, I was like,
726620	729620	everybody's so freaking talented.
729620	731620	Like, Emmie's talented, Icey's talented,
731620	736620	Azura's voice is pure fucking sex, dude.
736620	739620	Sorry, I had a burp.
739620	740620	Yeah, I'm trying.
740620	744620	He's not the only freaking burp in this company.
744620	748620	Let's see how long it takes for me to rip ass or something.
748620	751620	Burp a corp.
751620	754620	And I'll go right up to the mic.
754620	757620	And I'll do it.
757620	759620	It runs in the family.
759620	761620	But yeah, I'm really glad to be one of the daughters.
761620	765620	One of the whore daughters.
765620	768620	Although it's kind of funny.
768620	770620	People thought, oh bear, condition just kicked on.
770620	773620	We're just like, we're just going to be whores.
773620	774620	24-7.
774620	777620	I'm going to be little in my doodaw right here, right now.
777620	781620	No, like, I'm also a normal person.
781620	783620	I'm also like, you can chat with me,
783620	785620	and then, you know, you can go to Patreon,
785620	787620	and that's great, you know?
787620	789620	It's...
789620	790620	Hey, yo, what's up?
790620	792620	What, what's she saying?
792620	795620	All right, hear me out.
795620	799620	That'd be, you know,
799620	803620	and like my hair already kind of has like that snake-like appearance.
803620	804620	I don't know.
804620	806620	I can hear the, yeah, it's, it's loud.
806620	808620	It's like 80 degrees outside.
808620	809620	Leave me alone.
809620	811620	I kicked onto her debut.
811620	812620	Whatever.
812620	813620	I have my cat next to me.
813620	814620	My handsome little man.
814620	816620	He is sleeping in a bed.
816620	818620	I'll have a cat cam eventually.
818620	820620	So you guys can see my little boy.
820620	822620	This is, I have Boomi next to me.
822620	824620	Boomi King of Umashu,
824620	827620	because I am a,
827620	831620	I am a, I would call the last Airbender fan.
831620	834620	And then, yeah, the cat name drop.
834620	836620	The cat name drop.
836620	837620	Hold on.
837620	838620	I'm not actually, wait.
838620	840620	I'm not, let me, let's just,
840620	842620	I'm getting ahead of myself.
842620	843620	Ow, I hit my knee again.
843620	844620	It's because my legs are crossed.
844620	846620	I'm trying to sit all seductively in my chair.
846620	848620	It's not working out.
848620	849620	Fuck you.
849620	852620	Cat talks.
852620	854620	Let's go to my lore.
854620	856620	I'm going to pull myself up in the lore.
856620	861620	So you can just break down scene by scene.
861620	863620	Hello.
863620	865620	Where am I?
865620	868620	I need to manually play it.
868620	869620	Hold on.
869620	873620	Let me just, where am I?
873620	878620	Who am I?
878620	881620	You also will learn that I have fucking ADHD
881620	884620	and I forget what I'm doing.
884620	888620	I think it's, no.
888620	889620	It's dark.
889620	890620	Mommy, I can't see.
890620	891620	Shut up.
891620	892620	Shut up.
892620	893620	Just take it.
893620	896620	Just don't worry about it.
896620	897620	Don't worry.
897620	899620	Just bend over and take it.
899620	905620	You don't have to question anything.
905620	909620	Okay.
909620	911620	F my annoying ass voice.
911620	916620	I realize I go a lot deeper for when I record stuff.
916620	920620	There it is.
920620	922620	Whoopsies.
922620	925620	Give me just a, there we go.
925620	928620	When I'm nervous, I do lots of different voices.
928620	930620	It's just me.
930620	932620	What the fuck?
932620	939620	You know, I will constantly slip into a Scottish accent
939620	941620	because of Strani.
941620	944620	I got bad Aqualalia where you just mimic voices.
944620	947620	I usually mimic accents.
947620	949620	You're going to get a lot of cat mo.
949620	950620	I'm a fucking dork.
950620	951620	I'm sorry.
951620	952620	I'm sorry.
952620	953620	I'm a dummy, mommy.
953620	954620	I'll step on you.
954620	956620	I'll step on you so far.
956620	959620	I'm going to kick your fucking teeth in.
959620	961620	Don't get me started.
961620	964620	But I'm also a bit stupid.
964620	965620	I'm a blonde.
965620	966620	Don't forget that.
966620	967620	Anyways, hold on.
967620	971620	Let me just, okay.
971620	979620	So, like I was saying, I'm going to keep bunny.
979620	981620	It's like, hang in there.
981620	983620	And I'm really depressed.
983620	990620	You know, I really identified with this valley bunny girl.
990620	991620	Oh my God.
991620	992620	Why?
992620	994620	You don't like this voice?
994620	996620	What the fuck are you talking about?
996620	998620	You're such a fucking little bitch.
998620	1000620	Am I allowed to swear this much?
1000620	1002620	Am I going to get demonetized?
1002620	1005620	Immediately, when I get monetization, probably.
1005620	1010620	Because my titties are too fat and so is my ass.
1010620	1012620	And I swear a lot.
1012620	1013620	I'm sorry.
1013620	1018620	Like, I'm going to bully you.
1018620	1021620	Do you like sit by yourself at lunch?
1021620	1025620	Don't you like have any friends?
1025620	1026620	No?
1026620	1029620	What a fucking loser.
1029620	1030620	Wow.
1031620	1035620	What the fuck?
1035620	1036620	There's a dog barking out.
1036620	1039620	I hate my apartment building.
1039620	1043620	Yo, shut your fucking dog up.
1043620	1045620	I'm about to scream out my balcony.
1045620	1048620	Okay, anyways.
1048620	1051620	Like I said, I have ADHD.
1051620	1053620	A doctor said I got ADHD.
1053620	1056620	I don't know what that means, but I got 80 of them.
1056620	1059620	I need a drink.
1059620	1062620	He got that dog and I'm a wolf.
1062620	1067620	That's a spark.
1067620	1069620	School bully ASMR.
1069620	1071620	Hell yeah.
1071620	1073620	Okay.
1073620	1074620	3D.
1074620	1075620	That's very sensitive.
1075620	1076620	What do you mean?
1076620	1077620	Am I talking to the...
1077620	1078620	Wait, is my 3D a long?
1078620	1080620	No, it's not.
1080620	1082620	I record with AT2020.
1082620	1084620	That's also why my mic is shit.
1084620	1087620	You need a shirt and I'm like...
1087620	1090620	I'm totally fine.
1090620	1092620	It's good.
1092620	1095620	So yeah, I identify with this a lot.
1095620	1098620	Working in retail, slaving away.
1098620	1099620	I finally...
1099620	1102620	I need a noise gate.
1102620	1105620	How about I fucking noise your gate, bro?
1105620	1107620	Okay, hold on.
1107620	1111620	I do have a noise gate, actually.
1111620	1115620	Let's see.
1115620	1119620	How about now?
1119620	1120620	I also have a compressor.
1120620	1121620	I don't fucking know.
1121620	1122620	We'll figure that out later.
1122620	1124620	I don't...
1124620	1125620	I hate noise.
1125620	1127620	I hate...
1127620	1129620	I hate sounds.
1129620	1131620	I suck with audio.
1131620	1135620	They're like, oh, I hope the girls are like actually good with audio.
1135620	1138620	No, I'm not one of them.
1138620	1142620	I didn't do anything, but that's okay.
1142620	1144620	Thank you.
1145620	1146620	Mic settings are...
1146620	1148620	Yeah, just like...
1148620	1149620	Whatever.
1149620	1151620	But yeah, retail sucks.
1151620	1153620	I finally dropped to part time.
1153620	1154620	I got a part time...
1154620	1157620	I don't...
1157620	1158620	Wait, where is my...
1158620	1161620	I don't remember my fucking toggles.
1161620	1169620	I had to apply for a part time position that I already had.
1169620	1174620	I already was in the role as full time.
1174620	1183620	And I had to apply and go through two interviews just to be considered for part time.
1183620	1186620	Like, can you...
1186620	1191620	Mind you, I've been at this company for like almost six years.
1191620	1194620	It's not like they don't fucking know me.
1194620	1198620	So now I have more time to stream.
1198620	1199620	Thank God, that was my goal.
1199620	1200620	I just want...
1200620	1203620	I'm like, please, please, universe, just give me more time to stream.
1203620	1204620	I just want to be a streamer.
1204620	1206620	I just want to hang out with you guys.
1206620	1209620	I just want to yop, yop, yop, yop, yop.
1209620	1211620	Are you going to be a full time?
1211620	1212620	That's the goal.
1212620	1213620	That is the goal.
1213620	1216620	If I can stream full time, that is the goal.
1216620	1226620	Like, I just want to sit here and just talk to you and moan in your ear and like diddle you a bit and play some games.
1226620	1230620	And you know, call you a piece of trash because you are trash.
1230620	1232620	By the way, hope you don't forget that.
1232620	1238620	Just because I'm a little like, I'm a little, oh, I'm, I'm whatever.
1238620	1245620	That doesn't mean just because I have zoom or energy sometimes doesn't mean I won't be a fucking bitch.
1245620	1248620	You'll do what to me.
1248620	1249620	Don't worry about it.
1249620	1250620	Just close your eyes.
1250620	1251620	Just take it.
1251620	1253620	Anyways, so I've identified with this a lot.
1253620	1259620	I showed my mom parts of my lore video and my mom also identifies with this a lot.
1260620	1262620	Speaking of my mom, I love my parents.
1262620	1265620	My parents are very supportive of me that yes, they know I do loot audio.
1268620	1271620	Don't be like, can your parents look at you in the face?
1271620	1272620	Yeah.
1272620	1274620	My mom's like, get me on.
1274620	1275620	My dad's like, get me on.
1275620	1276620	Get us on stream.
1276620	1277620	Get us in recording.
1277620	1278620	Let's do some stuff.
1278620	1279620	I'm like, all right.
1279620	1280620	All right.
1282620	1283620	Is your mom sink?
1283620	1284620	No.
1284620	1286620	My mom is not single.
1286620	1288620	She is happily married to my father.
1288620	1290620	Get the fuck out.
1293620	1294620	Yeah.
1294620	1298620	My mom says she's going to hijack my channel so she can become a Vtuber.
1298620	1300620	Pull a Brea cookie boxes.
1300620	1304620	Mom, our cookie box and make a gardening channel.
1304620	1308620	She said, is your dad sick?
1310620	1311620	No.
1311620	1312620	My dad is a Chad though.
1312620	1315620	My dad and Strani's dad are so much alike.
1315620	1318620	My dad was just like, hey, are you going to be?
1318620	1319620	Okay.
1319620	1320620	You know what?
1320620	1322620	Let me just fuck this noise.
1324620	1327620	I'm just going to be fully in the frame because I can't stop talking.
1327620	1338620	My dad was like, I was like, dad, I got accepted for the Vtuber thing that I applied for.
1338620	1340620	And he's like, whoa.
1340620	1344620	So you're really a hentai waifu Vtuber?
1344620	1349620	And I'm like, yes.
1351620	1352620	And he's like, sick.
1352620	1357620	Don't tell me anything about it, but I'm proud of you.
1357620	1359620	Yes, my dad knows what hentai is.
1359620	1365620	And we had to thoroughly explain to my mother what it was with pictures.
1365620	1367620	It was quite funny.
1367620	1377620	My very religious conservative mother blushing profusely as we show her a clip from Bible Black.
1384620	1385620	Anyways.
1387620	1389620	Oh no, my parents are cool religious.
1389620	1394620	If when I was like super young to be like, wait, she's religious, how does this work?
1394620	1395620	I'm not religious.
1395620	1396620	Fuck that.
1397620	1398620	Respect though.
1398620	1403620	If you, you know, worship our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, then you know, all for you.
1403620	1408620	I'm just not a part of it, but my parents are very devout Christians.
1408620	1411620	But as I got older and I was just, you know, I wasn't feeling that.
1411620	1413620	They're just like, you know what, you do you boo.
1413620	1415620	And I think my parents for that.
1415620	1418620	My parents are based as hell.
1418620	1419620	You don't even know.
1419620	1421620	I'll tell more stories.
1421620	1423620	Moving on.
1427620	1429620	See if I can jerk my titties around.
1431620	1434620	Watching this is church parking lot right now.
1434620	1435620	Don't ask.
1436620	1439620	My dad's going to be so mad that I'm putting him on blast.
1439620	1445620	He's like, wait, you told her stream that that we we showed your mom had.
1445620	1446620	Why would you do that?
1446620	1449620	I don't know why my dad's southern, but in whatever.
1450620	1452620	But yeah, moving on.
1453620	1458620	I also didn't fight with this because this happened to me multiple times.
1458620	1461620	Remember when I said I worked there for like six years?
1461620	1463620	I still work there because I need insurance.
1468620	1470620	Yeah, I was passed up on a lot.
1470620	1471620	And I didn't even come up with the lore.
1471620	1473620	They just threw this at me and they're like, read the script.
1473620	1475620	And I was like, why the fuck is this me though?
1475620	1476620	This is me.
1476620	1477620	This is real.
1477620	1481620	But yeah, there's they're like, no, we don't we don't believe in nepotism.
1481620	1483620	What are you talking about?
1483620	1491620	And I'm like, you just gave this girl who just came in because she never mind.
1493620	1495620	She just gave this girl a job that I clearly deserve.
1495620	1498620	I've been there for three years and you just can't get to a girl.
1498620	1499620	It's been there for six months.
1499620	1500620	Let's fight.
1501620	1506620	Oh, my bosses don't see this because they know I stream too.
1513620	1518620	Somebody pointed out in Strani stream, they're like, oh, it's queen.
1518620	1523620	It queen was my my my pre-concept art and stop telling people you stream.
1525620	1529620	I tell all people I stream and people just find me.
1530620	1539620	I had one of my co-workers come up to me and be like, hey, I saw are you doing this like playing this game?
1541620	1542620	Was that was that you?
1542620	1546620	And I'm like, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
1546620	1547620	It wasn't me.
1551620	1557620	But yeah, queen, she's queen, rest in peace.
1557620	1559620	I kind of want an alternative outfit.
1559620	1562620	That's similar to her outfit, just like fur.
1562620	1566620	And then somebody also pointed out, I'll use the loli voice when you should.
1566620	1569620	The funny thing is, is that I did and they still know it was me.
1572620	1573620	I do.
1573620	1579620	Yeah, you guys know I do a lot of different voices and yes, I will continue to do so.
1580620	1588620	Someone said this looked like Contel VA and I'm like, oh shit, I didn't even get that until now.
1589620	1594620	In my debut, I glanced at chat real quick and someone's like, is that Contel VA?
1595620	1600620	And I'm like, hey, oh, it wasn't, it wasn't my intention.
1600620	1605620	Well, I might not even make this concept art and I didn't do the lore, but it wasn't the intention.
1605620	1606620	I can assure you that.
1606620	1609620	But it's funny that it happened.
1610620	1611620	It wasn't planned.
1611620	1612620	But a shout out to her.
1612620	1614620	She makes amazing audios.
1615620	1617620	Jorked off to one of them the other day.
1617620	1618620	Anyways.
1620620	1621620	Oh, damn.
1621620	1622620	Hold on.
1622620	1623620	Let me move my.
1627620	1629620	I got some tickle bitties.
1629620	1631620	I'll probably need to cover up because.
1633620	1637620	Because yeah, I'm probably going to get an outfit similar to the one I'm wearing in this.
1638620	1645620	Picture just because my bazonga hungers are bazonga hunging.
1650620	1654620	Oh my God, kids are running down the hallway screaming in my apartment building.
1657620	1665620	If I can just move out into the countryside with my three cats, get some dogs, some horses, some horses.
1666620	1670620	Some goats and just live on a farm.
1670620	1671620	No animals.
1671620	1672620	That's not everyone.
1672620	1679620	So every time you buy my merch and you, yeah, I got merch too, bitch.
1679620	1683620	You buy my merch and you support my Patreon.
1683620	1687620	You're helping me get one step closer to my tree.
1689620	1692620	Yeah, when I saw this, I'm like, this isn't going to be allowed.
1693620	1697620	I'm like, this isn't with this fucking.
1700620	1701620	Hold on.
1701620	1702620	Hold on.
1704620	1711620	Can someone like take a screenshot and like have me pointing like backwards like, oh fuck.
1711620	1712620	Excuse me.
1712620	1713620	Excuse me.
1715620	1721620	One step closer to Ram Ranch, 18 naked cowboys in the showers at Ram Ranch.
1726620	1727620	She did what?
1727620	1728620	Where?
1730620	1731620	Excuse me.
1731620	1732620	Seven out of 10 burp.
1732620	1733620	Fuck your mother.
1733620	1734620	What?
1734620	1737620	I burp like a fucking God, bro.
1738620	1741620	Anyways, I don't know why I keep calling you guys bro.
1741620	1742620	I need to start.
1742620	1743620	I used to call you trash.
1743620	1745620	I'm a fucking God trash.
1745620	1749620	What's a nice one syllable word?
1751620	1752620	You fucking sluts.
1754620	1756620	Oh, here's my neighbors.
1757620	1759620	Yapping their asses off.
1759620	1761620	I don't know if you can hear that on the background.
1761620	1765620	Anyways, they probably can hear me and I'm just like, ah ha ha, gips.
1767620	1768620	This is hot.
1769620	1770620	This is hot, but yeah.
1772620	1773620	He.
1774620	1775620	Can you speak while burping?
1775620	1776620	No.
1777620	1778620	Hi honey neighbors.
1779620	1780620	I love this.
1780620	1782620	This is like my favorite scene.
1784620	1789620	Because I just look so cute with my little hair up and with a glass of wine.
1791620	1792620	Hold on.
1792620	1795620	I'm going to do a hi honey.
1797620	1798620	It's a little nod.
1799620	1800620	Take a sip.
1802620	1803620	Perfect.
1803620	1807620	And then my queens in the background, like hot infinity pool.
1807620	1812620	You know what would have been funny if they had Azura just flying.
1812620	1816620	You know how in her lore video she just flies over?
1816620	1818620	Do you do voice training?
1818620	1819620	Do you know?
1819620	1820620	I'm just like that.
1821620	1822620	I give credit.
1822620	1825620	My dad will probably say this.
1825620	1829620	I give credit to my father for giving me a wide voice range.
1829620	1835620	Because my dad's voice is super deep, but he can go super fucking high like me.
1835620	1841620	And so sometimes they're like, I would, for example, let's say I do something and I fuck up.
1842620	1843620	And I don't know.
1843620	1847620	I stubbed my toe, you know, like that one snot nose kid from the Simpsons.
1847620	1849620	They go ha ha ha.
1849620	1852620	My dad does that perfectly.
1853620	1856620	And so we would just be like ha ha ha.
1856620	1857620	And then they would talk higher.
1857620	1867620	And you can also do the, um, the fucking, uh, the PDF file from, um, South Park voice.
1867620	1869620	Hey there little boy.
1869620	1871620	I can't do it.
1871620	1874620	My dad, my dad is a good voice actor.
1874620	1876620	He should, he should honestly voice in games.
1876620	1881620	And my mom just sounds like can really do a really good Muppet impression.
1881620	1884620	She'll try to be British and she just sounds like a Muppet.
1884620	1890620	Um, family guy, whatever, whatever, bro.
1890620	1892620	I mean, slut.
1892620	1898620	I mean, you guys need a name when getting dad.
1898620	1900620	Can you do a Russian voice?
1900620	1904620	One of my, hold on.
1904620	1906620	I need to think of IC.
1906620	1909620	And one of my best friends is also, she's Russian too.
1909620	1913620	Shout out to, shout out to my girl.
1913620	1917620	Um, everybody's Russian, the Finnish.
1917620	1925620	No, I can't, I can't do it right now because then I'm going to slip into, I always end up slipping into a British accent.
1925620	1931620	And then sometimes when I'm listening to Strony, I'll just slip into her, her Scottish accent and she's been teaching me Scots.
1932620	1938620	But I also just sound like I'm from Northern, cause I can't roll my, my Rs that well.
1938620	1945620	Sound like I'm from Northern Britain or UK or whatever.
1945620	1949620	What about calling a slit? No.
1949620	1953620	I'm not going to be like, hey slave on YouTube.
1953620	1955620	What's up you guys?
1955620	1956620	We're talking to this.
1956620	1958620	What's up you slave?
1958620	1963620	Are you trying to get me canceled?
1963620	1967620	Are you trying to get me canceled?
1967620	1968620	Do not clip this out of context.
1968620	1970620	I will come for you.
1970620	1971620	Not like that.
1971620	1973620	I will come for you.
1973620	1975620	I'm coming for you.
1975620	1977620	Coming for your family.
1977620	1982620	I'm coming for your, your, your career.
1982620	1985620	I'm coming on your lap.
1985620	1986620	All right.
1986620	1987620	All right.
1987620	1988620	Stop it.
1988620	1989620	Stop it.
1989620	1990620	Stop it.
1990620	1991620	Ah, Shibi, what are you doing?
1991620	1992620	What are you doing?
1992620	1993620	Shibi.
1993620	2002620	Ah, anyways, at least take me out to dinner first.
2002620	2005620	Nah, we're going straight to third base.
2005620	2006620	You know what that is?
2006620	2008620	Holding hands.
2011620	2012620	How about calling you Scum?
2012620	2014620	Oh, I like Scum.
2014620	2019620	I love her absolutely scatterbrained Tommy.
2019620	2020620	That's me.
2020620	2023620	And I'm getting too lewd.
2023620	2024620	I'm getting too lewd.
2024620	2032620	And it's like, I've always been like not say so, but I usually, it's usually just in
2032620	2038620	the frame of what's it called, just swearing and cursing.
2038620	2043620	But now I can just make really stupid, perfected jokes just because I can.
2044620	2047620	Oh, okay.
2047620	2049620	And holding is insane.
2049620	2051620	I know.
2051620	2053620	Hey, look, it's me.
2053620	2058620	So yeah, people are like, Shibi, Shibi, hold on.
2058620	2060620	Where's the, where's the dumb?
2060620	2065620	Oh, where's the dumb face?
2065620	2067620	There we go.
2067620	2071620	This is what, this is how I picture you guys.
2071620	2075620	Oh, Shibi, when you wear Shiba, he rubs.
2075620	2081620	If you're not, like, domesticated.
2087620	2089620	Because I don't fucking know.
2089620	2095620	And obviously I kind of thought my Laura would explain it like it's just my get up.
2095620	2100620	I just wear it and you know, you can be a dumb and like pain.
2100620	2101620	Right?
2101620	2109620	Like, you know, you're allowed to also enjoy things.
2109620	2115620	Like, I just, you know, like, you want to know how much of a dumb I am.
2115620	2117620	Let me tell you a secret.
2117620	2118620	Let me tell you.
2118620	2125620	Oh, by the way, this is the voice that I mostly use for my, my naughty audios.
2126620	2131620	So, so 100% a switch.
2131620	2133620	Shut the fuck up.
2133620	2134620	Shut the fuck.
2134620	2138620	No, let's not be guys, guys.
2138620	2142620	Okay, I'll educate you after this because Jesus Christ.
2142620	2144620	I can maintain it.
2144620	2150620	By the way, but what the fuck was I saying?
2156620	2159620	Where am I?
2159620	2162620	Because someone remind me what the hell I was saying.
2162620	2166620	Again, I have, I have, I have short term memory.
2166620	2169620	Audio's voice talking about being a dumb.

3316620	3317620	One of my my girlfriends.
3319620	3321620	I need to come up with a code name for her.
3321620	3322620	Because I'm going to call her by her real name.
3322620	3324620	I'm going to call her.
3326620	3327620	Salem.
3327620	3328620	Because she's witch like.
3328620	3329620	Salem.
3330620	3334620	She said because she's very supportive of my VTubing.
3334620	3337620	She's the only person that knows outside my parents.
3339620	3341620	And she's like, please get me on your stream.
3341620	3346620	And we can do like some sort of podcast where we talk about really smutty books.
3346620	3348620	Like a court of thorn and roses.
3348620	3349620	Or credence.
3349620	3350620	Oh, credence.
3352620	3354620	Hey, if you guys like Emmy.
3356620	3357620	You should read credence.

3361620	3362620	Colleen Hoover.
3362620	3363620	I forget.
3364620	3365620	Sort of truth.
3365620	3366620	Actually, I have.
3368620	3369620	I know he said sort of truth.
3369620	3370620	But I have.
3370620	3374620	I literally have like the Witcher books on my.
3374620	3375620	I'm looking to the side right now.
3375620	3376620	The Witcher.
3376620	3377620	Books on my bookshelf.
3377620	3380620	I have Joe Abercombe the blade itself.
3380620	3381620	My favorite.
3383620	3385620	Series that I've read.
3385620	3386620	Or.
3386620	3388620	Well, my favorite like book series of all time.
3388620	3392620	Or actually no TV show series and kind of book series has to be.
3393620	3394620	The magicians.
3394620	3397620	The book series obviously blows the fucking show out of the water.
3397620	3398620	But I like the show too.
3400620	3402620	I also really like Brandon Sanderson.
3402620	3403620	What's.
3403620	3405620	What's the other dude's name that wrote.
3406620	3407620	Hold on.
3407620	3408620	Let me move over to my.
3410620	3411620	Where did the book go?
3413620	3415620	Oh, it's going to bother the crap out of me if I don't know the name.
3415620	3416620	Hold on.
3419620	3422620	Red sister by Mark Lawrence.
3422620	3423620	I love Mark Lawrence.
3424620	3426620	And let me see.
3427620	3428620	Why is it a lot?
3428620	3433620	And mind you, my dad recommends every book that I've read because of my dad's a huge reader.
3433620	3434620	Scott Lynch.
3434620	3438620	Scott Lynch needs to also release more books because he's a great writer.
3439620	3440620	How about Jordan?
3440620	3441620	Yes.
3441620	3442620	Just read the blade itself.
3442620	3443620	What did you think?
3443620	3444620	Yeah.
3444620	3447620	Brandon said, I still have to read the last book in the Stormlight archive.
3447620	3448620	I know that came out like last year.
3448620	3451620	I want to get the nice, nice, really fancy hard, hard cover.
3452620	3453620	Cooking.
3453620	3454620	Cooking.
3454620	3455620	Cooking.
3455620	3456620	Cooking.
3456620	3457620	Cooking.
3457620	3458620	Cooking.
3458620	3459620	I love to cook.
3459620	3462620	You might see on my all, I've actually posted pictures of stuff that I've cooked.
3462620	3464620	I definitely want to do some cooking streams.
3464620	3466620	I don't know how I'm going to manage that.
3467620	3473620	Because I like, I don't know how people do cooking streams as a VTuber, but we'll try.
3474620	3476620	I know a lot of random internet shit.
3477620	3481620	Like, well, did you know that?
3484620	3485620	Excuse me.
3486620	3491620	That humans are covered in stripes.
3491620	3495620	We just can't see them, but our pets, like our cats can see them.
3495620	3501620	I forget what the stripes are actually called, but it's on a different, I think it's like UV rays or something.
3502620	3503620	Ranger.
3503620	3504620	Yeah.
3504620	3505620	Oh yes.
3505620	3506620	I wanted to read Rangers apprentice.
3506620	3508620	That's definitely on my list.
3509620	3510620	Just take bow or scooch.
3510620	3511620	Yeah.
3511620	3512620	Yeah.
3512620	3515620	Or I'm really, I'm blanking on names right now.
3515620	3519620	But that other big, I literally watch her.
3519620	3520620	I don't know why I'm playing your name.
3520620	3521620	Who also does a lot of cooking streams.
3522620	3523620	Jujitsu.
3523620	3529620	I got into Jujitsu because Onigiri.
3529620	3530620	Thank you.
3530620	3531620	Thank you.
3531620	3532620	Thank you.
3532620	3533620	Onigiri.
3533620	3534620	Yes.
3534620	3535620	Onigiri.
3535620	3537620	I'm like, I was thinking of another Japanese food.
3538620	3540620	I was like, no, not Konigiri.
3540620	3542620	What's the right one?
3543620	3544620	Got Connie on the brain.
3544620	3545620	Whoopsies.
3548620	3556620	When I was younger, someone broke into my house when I was 13 and I was home alone.
3557620	3568620	And I decided to run after the guy.
3568620	3572620	There was a grown ass man in my house and I chased him out.
3575620	3576620	And then I called the police.
3577620	3583620	And then my dad tried hunting for him for a very, very long time.
3585620	3588620	But afterwards my parents put me in Jujitsu classes.
3588620	3590620	And so I'm all, don't get it twisted.
3590620	3593620	I'm only a white belt, but it doesn't mean I won't put you in the grounds.
3594620	3595620	I know submissions.
3596620	3597620	I'm very strong.
3597620	3598620	I've taken it.
3598620	3603620	And my school that I attended was co-ed.
3603620	3608620	So I sparred with guys like twice my size and I still put their asses to sleep.
3608620	3609620	Do not get it twisted.
3611620	3615620	I will gladly knock you out.
3617620	3618620	And I like to watch UFC too.
3619620	3622620	I'm pretty gory like that.
3625620	3627620	My mom's teaching me about gardening.
3628620	3631620	I love listening to my mom talk about gardening.
3632620	3634620	So I think I want to get into gardening more.
3634620	3635620	And then obviously voice acting.
3636620	3637620	Wow.
3637620	3638620	I wouldn't have given that away.
3640620	3641620	I'm only on my second fucking slide.
3642620	3643620	Yeah, we already talked about this.
3645620	3646620	Dollhouse.
3646620	3647620	I love Dollhouse.
3647620	3648620	Great show.
3648620	3649620	Dungeon Mesh is good.
3650620	3651620	I love Robotech.
3651620	3655620	I literally have the OG discs on my entertainment center right now.
3655620	3659620	Princess Bride is my all-time favorite movie.
3659620	3660620	Hands down.
3660620	3662620	I can quote that movie word for word.
3663620	3673620	And I think it started a trend into the type of men I'm into because I really liked Wesley and I really liked Howl.
3673620	3677620	And they look very similar in hindsight.
3677620	3683620	And it's funny, my mom almost named me Wesley if I was a boy after him.
3683620	3685620	You've never seen the Princess Bride?
3686620	3688620	I've seen it like 10 times.
3688620	3689620	Also Lady Hawk is good.
3689620	3690620	I should put Lady Hawk on here.
3690620	3691620	Haunting a Hill House.
3691620	3692620	Bom.
3693620	3694620	Bom.
3694620	3696620	My name is Enugamentoya.
3697620	3698620	You killed my father.
3699620	3700620	Prepare to die.
3701620	3702620	Inconceivable.
3704620	3706620	Two times watch it more.
3706620	3707620	Against your will.
3707620	3708620	It's a great movie.
3710620	3711620	What are you talking about?
3711620	3713620	Yeah, I like that is my comfort.
3713620	3716620	If I'm really upset, I'm watching the Princess Bride.
3719620	3723620	I just binge watched a show called Harlots.
3723620	3727620	It's about brothel madams in Victorian England.
3727620	3732620	I like a lot of period films and shows like Tudors.
3732620	3739620	I know Game of Thrones isn't a period, but I like older settings, but also sci-fi.
3739620	3742620	Like I said, the magicians, although it's more like fantasy.
3743620	3747620	But I'm trying to think of another sci-fi show that I've watched.
3748620	3749620	I can't remember.
3749620	3751620	Anyways, games.
3755620	3756620	I'm trying to think.
3757620	3758620	Again, I'm blonde.
3758620	3760620	It takes me a long time and I'm a hag.
3761620	3763620	I don't play a lot of games.
3764620	3766620	I've never, I've gamed a lot when I was younger.
3766620	3770620	My dad was a badass and he, we were poor.
3770620	3773620	So he emulated games on my PC.
3775620	3776620	Star Trek, yes.
3776620	3777620	Star Wars, yes.
3778620	3779620	Battlestar Galactica, yes.
3780620	3782620	You prefer haunting a blind manor?
3784620	3785620	You're dumb.
3785620	3786620	Get out of here.
3787620	3788620	Mods.
3788620	3789620	Kick them out.
3791620	3794620	If you like horror, archive 81 though.
3794620	3795620	I'm so mad.
3796620	3797620	Ow, I just hit my arm.
3797620	3800620	I'm so mad that archive 81 got canceled.
3800620	3802620	That show fucked me up.
3802620	3803620	Babylon 5.
3803620	3804620	I've never heard of Babylon 5.
3805620	3806620	Never heard of Babylon 5.
3807620	3808620	I've heard of World of Horror.
3810620	3812620	I've played Alien Isolation.
3812620	3813620	I will not do it again.
3814620	3816620	I love, yeah, but I love horror though.
3817620	3821620	I want to do like a drunk stream of amnesia, the dark descent, because I think it'd be funny.
3821620	3823620	Babylon 5 is starting to get me Star Trek.
3823620	3824620	Ooh, okay.
3824620	3825620	All right.
3826620	3828620	I have not watched Star Trek Andromeda.
3833620	3834620	Have you played FNAF?
3834620	3836620	Yes, I've played FNAF.
3837620	3838620	Of course.
3841620	3842620	You know what I didn't mention?
3842620	3846620	I didn't like, I also watched, I used to be obsessed with Marvel.
3846620	3854620	Like, when I was like eight or, I don't know how old I was when X-Men the Last Stand came out.
3855620	3857620	No, I don't really know.
3858620	3861620	But I saw that it's a shitty movie.
3863620	3867620	But I just fell in love with the X-Men.
3867620	3870620	So I was obsessed with the X-Men for the longest time.
3870620	3871620	Looping the third.
3871620	3872620	I've seen Looping the Third.
3872620	3881620	And then in terms of like anime, I grew up, the first anime, again, my dad, big, big contributor to a lot of the content that I absorbed.
3881620	3886620	He, the first anime I ever watched was The Cat Returns.
3886620	3888620	Yes, I had a crush on the cat.
3888620	3889620	X-Men 80s.
3889620	3892620	I watched the first episode of X-Men 87.
3893620	3894620	I didn't like it.
3895620	3896620	Maybe I have to watch it again.
3896620	3897620	I don't know.
3898620	3899620	2000s.
3899620	3900620	It came out of 2006.
3900620	3901620	Oh, damn.
3902620	3903620	In the comics.
3903620	3904620	Yes, I actually have.
3904620	3907620	I have a lot of old OG Thunderbolt comics right next to me right now.
3910620	3921620	But the thing is, I'm so pissed what they did with the Thunderbolts movie.
3921620	3922620	I'm so angry.
3922620	3923620	Like Thunderbolts.
3924620	3925620	I love Thunderbolts.
3925620	3931620	Like in that like, they just totally ruined it.
3931620	3934620	Like they just totally retconned everything.
3934620	3936620	And yeah, I'm not, I don't even want to talk about it.
3938620	3941620	We can thank Cat Returns for rewinding up an anti-wife.
3941620	3942620	Yeah, I guess so.
3944620	3946620	Yeah, I've been watching Mushu Tensei.
3946620	3947620	I can't pronounce it.
3947620	3953620	I also really like, because I like dungeon meshi so much, I like went on a binge watch of watching food related enemies.
3954620	3955620	Enemies.
3955620	3956620	Enemies.
3956620	3957620	So I watched like a little bit of food wars.
3957620	3958620	It's fucking weird.
3958620	3959620	I'm not finishing that.
3961620	3969620	And then I watched my cooking skill from another world or using my cooking skill in another world or useless or whatever.
3969620	3972620	I don't know what's the trend with some anime lately.
3972620	3974620	Just having the weirdest names.
3974620	3975620	So.
3977620	3979620	I should be banished to catch a stream.
3979620	3980620	I really like Marvel.
3980620	3981620	Personally, I don't know.
3982620	3985620	No DC lovers here.
3986620	3987620	No DC.
3988620	3989620	Fuck DC.
3991620	3992620	Yeah.
3992620	3995620	But I don't mind Isekai that bad.
3995620	3997620	But I'm really like, people like, I hate Isekai.
3997620	3998620	Isekai sucks.
3998620	4001620	And then I realized I didn't know how prevalent it was in the anime.
4001620	4007620	It was like, I grew up watching Naruto, Bleach, Fullmetal Alchemist, staying up watching that on Adult Swim.
4008620	4011620	And just like being like having it on mute so my parents don't hear.
4011620	4022620	You know the first episode of Fullmetal Alchemist I watched and spoiler where it was the one where a girl gets turned into that bird thing.
4022620	4023620	I can't quite remember.
4023620	4028620	And then she's like dies and just like covered in blood and like bird feathers everywhere across his bed.
4028620	4030620	That's the first thing I saw.
4030620	4033620	And I was like, this is so cool.
4033620	4034620	Oh no, not me.
4034620	4035620	Not me.
4035620	4036620	No.
4036620	4037620	Not me.
4039620	4042620	It was like one of the first like three episodes, I think.
4042620	4045620	It wasn't the, it wasn't the Chimera episode.
4045620	4046620	It wasn't that one.
4047620	4050620	But someone asked about Junji Ito.
4050620	4052620	Yes, I read every Junji Ito thing.
4052620	4054620	I love Junji Ito.
4054620	4055620	I love the art style.
4055620	4056620	I love body horror.
4057620	4059620	I am a fan of body horror and gore.
4060620	4064620	Although, you know, weirdly enough, I don't super like slasher films.
4064620	4068620	Like you're not going to catch me watching saw, but like I'll watch it.
4068620	4075620	But I'm like, I prefer more in terms of horror, like spooky, like sparritism.
4077620	4078620	Let's see.
4078620	4079620	I've heard of Let's See.
4079620	4080620	I've not watched it.
4080620	4081620	It's episode two.
4081620	4082620	Oh, okay.
4082620	4083620	There you go.
4083620	4086620	I've watched both Fullmetal Alchemists.
4086620	4087620	I have.
4087620	4091620	I remember watching PewDiePie play Corpse Party when I was younger.
4091620	4092620	That was great.
4092620	4093620	The ring.
4093620	4094620	Yes.
4094620	4095620	Psychological horror.
4095620	4096620	That's right.
4096620	4097620	I really liked.
4100620	4104620	I think Archive 81 had a little bit of psychological horror.
4105620	4106620	I like suspense.
4107620	4108620	Hamels.
4108620	4109620	Hamels.
4109620	4110620	Joker.
4110620	4111620	Hands down.
4111620	4113620	You don't even have to ask.
4113620	4116620	You don't even have to ask Sans the Lambs.
4116620	4117620	Of course.
4117620	4118620	The witch.
4118620	4119620	That was good.
4119620	4121620	And the ritual was good too.
4122620	4123620	Are you into motorcycles?
4123620	4124620	They're all right.
4124620	4125620	I guess.
4128620	4129620	I like horror visual novels.
4129620	4130620	Yeah.
4130620	4135620	I like, I remember like Ib Corpse Party, Mad Father.
4135620	4139620	I have not watched Suspiria.
4139620	4140620	I have not watched that.
4141620	4142620	Yeah.
4142620	4143620	I remember seven.
4144620	4145620	You start to laugh.
4145620	4152620	But yeah, in terms of games, like I want to play Soul's Likes.
4153620	4154620	Hold on.
4154620	4155620	Let me skip ahead a little bit.
4156620	4157620	Let me skip ahead.
4159620	4161620	So you got some names here.
4161620	4162620	Little girl, big mama and big man.
4162620	4164620	You already know big man is booming.
4165620	4174620	I also call him Metro booming or the boomster or titties because he has a little pouch that makes him look like he has little titties.
4175620	4181620	Little girl, she's named after a character from Elden Ring.
4181620	4186620	Can you guess what her name is?
4186620	4192620	And then big mama is Reina, which is funny because it sounds like Ronnie.
4192620	4195620	But that's not where like the spelling is similar.
4195620	4198620	Just rearrange the letters, but it's not.
4200620	4201620	Let's see.
4201620	4203620	Let's say Ronnie.
4203620	4204620	No, Raya.
4204620	4205620	Molina.
4205620	4206620	No.
4206620	4207620	Melania.
4207620	4208620	No.
4208620	4209620	Dong eater.
4209620	4210620	Yeah.
4210620	4211620	Yeah.
4211620	4212620	Come here.
4212620	4213620	Dong eater.
4213620	4214620	Where is she anyways?
4214620	4215620	Where's my little dong eater?
4216620	4217620	I don't even know.
4217620	4218620	Is she next to me?
4218620	4219620	No.
4219620	4221620	Sometimes she likes to go under my blanket under my legs.
4221620	4222620	I don't know where she went.
4222620	4225620	Her name is Fia, the death bed companion.
4226620	4228620	I love to snuggle her.
4228620	4230620	She's a snuggler, this little baby.
4230620	4234620	Then I can't move because I love snuggling her death.
4234620	4237620	Oh, she stinks though because she likes to fart on me and it sucks.
4237620	4238620	She's really stinky farts.
4239620	4241620	So she is, I guess, the dong eater.
4244620	4246620	You know what I should have put up here for dislikes.
4246620	4249620	I should have put people who have bad breath that puts me off a lot.
4250620	4251620	Hate bad breath.
4251620	4252620	Disgusting.
4253620	4254620	Yeah, I'm allergic to rabbits.
4255620	4263620	It's funny because I didn't know that until recently when I went over a friend's house
4263620	4268620	and they were house sitting some rabbits that they normally don't have.
4268620	4270620	And I was like, oh, I love rabbits.
4270620	4272620	Bunnies are so freaking cute.
4272620	4273620	Don't get me wrong.
4273620	4274620	Look at me.
4274620	4275620	I'm fucking sexy.
4280620	4283620	Hold on, I'm trying to jiggle my titties but they weren't jiggling the way I wanted to.
4284620	4285620	Don't worry yourself.
4287620	4291620	So I was like hanging out with these bunnies and I'm petting them and I'm like, yeah, I forget.
4291620	4293620	Like it's name is Harold.
4293620	4294620	Harold's the hair.
4296620	4305620	And yeah, I almost went to Anaphylactic show after because I'm also mildly allergic to dogs and cats.
4305620	4309620	So if I like, but if I just don't touch my face, I'm fine.
4309620	4317620	But I had rubbed my hand against my nose after petting the bunny and it was not a good.
4317620	4320620	And it's funny because my mom's like, oh yeah, I'm allergic to rabbits.
4320620	4327620	And I'm like, why did I inherit the ability to be allergic to rabbits from my mom?
4327620	4331620	Like I don't, what is the, but like I'll still pet a rabbit.
4331620	4332620	I don't care.
4332620	4335620	I'll risk my life to pet myself every day.
4335620	4345620	You might be thinking, wow, Sheeby, you are so full of energy.
4345620	4349620	You are so extrovert.
4349620	4356620	I'm not actually, I only, I only really get this way when I have to work because I used to work in sales.
4356620	4359620	But now I'm doing something else.
4359620	4361620	So I know how to like sell stuff.
4361620	4362620	So like buy my merch.
4363620	4365620	I don't have to tell you twice.
4365620	4366620	Do it.
4366620	4368620	Buy my merch.
4368620	4369620	I'll show it to you later.
4370620	4372620	Let me take a step on my team.
4378620	4380620	I look so funny when I'm drinking.
4386620	4389620	Oh, I don't even know where I put the.
4390620	4392620	There it is.
4395620	4397620	Can I just like drop this in here?
4397620	4398620	Oh, I can't.
4399620	4402620	Can I just download this?
4405620	4408620	My link for my merch is in my description.
4408620	4411620	Check the description down below and you can get merch.
4414620	4415620	What's there?
4416620	4419620	Oh, please.
4419620	4425620	Can I please just copy and paste for the love of Christ Almighty.
4425620	4427620	My voice is starting to crack though.
4427620	4428620	There it is.
4431620	4432620	Look at it.
4432620	4433620	I got my own merch.
4433620	4434620	That's it.
4434620	4441620	It's funny because like one of my goals being a Vtuber, I was like, I always got my own merch and then I'm signed on and I get merch.
4441620	4448620	And I was like, I've always wanted to voice in a video game and I'm signed on and I'm in a video game which is coming out soon.
4450620	4453620	I've seen some of the promotional art for the game.
4453620	4455620	Oh my God.
4456620	4458620	You're definitely going to be seeing my cotton bum.
4458620	4459620	That's all I can say.
4459620	4461620	But yeah, go check that out.
4461620	4463620	Check out the other girls merch too as well.
4463620	4469620	Make sure that you look at the description below and yeah.
4469620	4471620	We've got some cool standees.
4471620	4484620	So if you want to, you know, have me on your desk so I can like and you can like put a little sticky note under my head that just says like you fucking suck or something like I'm salting you.
4484620	4489620	And then I got a key chain and then I got, um, what else do I got?
4489620	4493620	I got a sweatshirt and sweatpants and I think I want to go for myself too.
4493620	4495620	Let me get rid of this.
4496620	4497620	Sorry.
4497620	4502620	Again, the bun speak voice comes, comes out when I'm excited.
4504620	4505620	Put in the jar.
4508620	4509620	Excuse me.
4509620	4512620	Do not, do not put me in the jar, please.
4512620	4514620	Please don't put me in the jar.
4516620	4519620	After getting to a car accident, I jumped off a cliff.
4523620	4524620	That is true.
4524620	4530620	I was sleeping over at my friend's house and we were going to get McDonald's.
4530620	4535620	It was like 2am and she's like, yeah, what's the McDonald's?
4535620	4536620	And I'm like, yeah, let's get frosty.
4536620	4541620	So we are, I'm like, I forgot what it was, but I wasn't driving because I wasn't old enough to drive yet.
4541620	4542620	Nine out of ten.
4542620	4543620	Okay.
4543620	4544620	Thank you.
4544620	4545620	Eight out of ten.
4545620	4546620	Perfect.
4546620	4547620	Oh, six out of ten.
4548620	4549620	Perfect.
4549620	4550620	Nine out of ten.
4554620	4555620	And so we're driving.
4555620	4556620	We're driving.
4556620	4563620	And then this person had apparently fallen asleep at the wheel while she was texting.
4563620	4565620	So like double whammy.
4565620	4573620	And so she fell asleep and she, her foot just pressed into the pedal and she rammed us from behind.
4573620	4578620	And then we fishtailed and spun out on the highway.
4579620	4580620	It was crazy.
4580620	4585620	And she, the other driver, flipped over the barrier.
4585620	4589620	And so we're pulled over.
4589620	4593620	We're like off in the middle pulled over kind of.
4594620	4598620	And my friend runs across the highway.
4598620	4600620	Like, yeah, it's 2am.
4600620	4603620	But people are still driving.
4603620	4606620	She runs across the highway to check on the other driver.
4606620	4608620	I'm calling 911.
4608620	4609620	You know what?
4609620	4612620	We literally all walked away.
4612620	4613620	Fine.
4613620	4614620	Like I didn't get injured.
4614620	4616620	I had like a little bit of whiplash.
4616620	4617620	So did my friend.
4617620	4629620	And the other driver who flipped over the guardrail didn't, didn't, she only had like a little bit of scratches on her hands because like her phone was in her hand when she fell asleep.
4629620	4631620	It was crazy.
4631620	4638620	So I call my mom to come pick me up because I'm like, I just want to go home and be with my mommy.
4638620	4639620	And yeah.
4639620	4641620	Oh, lucky that I should like 100%.
4641620	4643620	We all should have freaking died.
4643620	4646620	Like it was, it was, it was crazy.
4646620	4648620	I don't, it was really crazy.
4648620	4651620	But um, and I'm like, you know what, you know what I should do?
4651620	4657620	I should jump off a cliff because the next day I was invited to go to this quarry and the quarry is this place where
4659620	4663620	there's like a, it's like a, kind of got water hole, but it's, there's cliffs all around.
4663620	4668620	It's like an old rock quarry, but it's full of water and people usually go and jump and swim in there.
4668620	4677620	And so I'm like, mom, can I, like I was invited to go with my friends and I'm like, mom, can I please, can I please go to the quarry with the girls?
4677620	4679620	And my mom's like, yeah.
4679620	4684620	And I'm like, and then I got there.
4684620	4687620	One, it was a, it was a dump, by the way.
4687620	4694620	Like don't anytime, any place that there's like not publicly maintained.
4694620	4697620	Like there was like beer bottles broken.
4697620	4699620	I'm pretty sure I saw needles.
4699620	4700620	There was like shit everywhere.
4700620	4706620	I cut my foot on a bottle walking barefoot and then I slipped on a rock.
4706620	4714620	And then there's a part of the cliff that's 50 feet up.
4715620	4717620	And I'm like, you know what?
4717620	4720620	Let me jump off.
4720620	4722620	I almost died before.
4722620	4725620	Let's try it again.
4725620	4730620	Cue the Kermit jumping off the building gift.
4730620	4742620	And I hit the water and I think I actually got worse whiplash from that because I landed like kind of folded in half and I snapped back up.
4743620	4748620	And yeah, what was fun, I can just say, it's just a fun story to tell.
4748620	4751620	Do you know that the voice one?
4751620	4755620	I lost two of my bunny lives.
4755620	4758620	I don't know, bunnies have lives like cats, but yeah.
4758620	4760620	I met the voice of Mario.
4760620	4762620	He was pretty sick, came into my job once.
4762620	4764620	I don't even know why he was there.
4764620	4771620	And he's like taking pictures and videos with some of my coworkers and I'm just there like, oh my God, my child.
4771620	4774620	Oh my God, my childhood is right in front of me.
4774620	4779620	Mario, I used to fucking play the shit out of Mario on the Wii.
4779620	4783620	And he's like, oh, do you want a picture?
4783620	4798620	I'm like, no, no, no, I couldn't because like as someone who has been in the entertainment industry for a while outside of VTubing, I know how annoying it is to have people walk up to you and be like, can I get a picture?
4798620	4800620	So I was like, oh, no, I'll just sit back.
4800620	4802620	But he was just like, he was so nice.
4802620	4815620	He insisted on taking a picture and I sent it to my parents and my dad was like, oh my God, my mom was like, yes, Charles, he is the sweetest, the sweetest person ever.
4815620	4817620	I will tell you that, not Chris Pratt.
4817620	4819620	It was not Chris Pratt.
4819620	4821620	That would be funny though.
4821620	4825620	Where did my, okay, there it is.
4825620	4827620	I'm losing my voice.
4827620	4829620	I want to be a souls like first souls.
4829620	4831620	I was going to play Bloodborne, but they didn't do a port like I wanted.
4831620	4833620	So come on, Sony.
4833620	4839620	Looks like, I don't know if I can learn Japanese, but I would like to.
4839620	4840620	I know a little bit of Spanish.
4840620	4843620	I know a little bit of French.
4843620	4844620	Who knows?
4844620	4845620	Who knows?
4845620	4847620	Have you hit 100K views?
4847620	4848620	That'd be so cool.
4848620	4849620	Hit 10K subs.
4849620	4854620	I'm almost halfway there, which is crazy to me.
4854620	4856620	Crazy German.
4856620	4857620	How are you live?
4857620	4858620	Don't know.
4858620	4861620	I am Scottish too.
4861620	4869620	So I could try to learn Scots and feel like I'm not culturally appropriating or something.
4869620	4870620	Yeah.
4870620	4871620	Shadow of the Erd Tree soon.
4871620	4872620	I know.
4872620	4874620	I know people have asked me like, are you going to play that on stream?
4874620	4879620	I don't know why, but Elden Ring is a comfort game to me.
4879620	4885620	I don't know if I'll play it on stream because that is a game that pulled me through
4885620	4887620	a very, very tough situation.
4887620	4890620	You know, you get down in the dumps.
4890620	4891620	Got that mental Illinois.
4891620	4896620	And that's, that is a game I just put poured so many hours into.
4896620	4897620	Yes, a comfort game.
4897620	4900620	You, we be like, how is the souls like a comfort game?
4900620	4910620	But like, it was, it was a way to helpfully kind of express my frustration on a video.
4910620	4914620	Although I have broken a pair of headphones before, so I can't really talk of headphones I'm wearing right now.
4914620	4919620	I actually broke while playing a lot as a PA smash, smash them on the ground.
4919620	4927620	But it was just like, I liked the dopamine I got from beating a boss from coming with the builds.
4927620	4932620	It was, it was really fun to nerd out on something I normally don't nerd out on.
4932620	4936620	Because again, like I've said in the past, I played a lot of CSGO.
4936620	4940620	I played Overwatch, not playing Overwatch 2.
4941620	4943620	I played a lot of like FPS games.
4943620	4944620	Like I play a lot of cod.
4947620	4952620	I didn't like I play a lot of Valorant, but I'm not like in the last year or so.
4952620	4954620	I haven't been playing any FPSs.
4955620	4957620	And I've been playing like inscription.
4957620	4961620	I've been playing, you know, some horror games.
4961620	4963620	I've been playing, I'm trying to think of more games that I've played.
4964620	4966620	The coffin of Andy and Laylay I've played.
4970620	4972620	Your CS2 account got hacked.
4972620	4973620	Oh no.
4973620	4976620	Yeah, I gambled like 1000s of skins away.
4976620	4977620	So fuck that game.
4979620	4984620	I do want to play buckshot roulette because that, they have like the best fucking music.
4984620	4988620	Almost like every time.
4990620	4993620	Neo and Neo 2 for so, wait, hold on a second.
4994620	4998620	Neo is a souls like.
4998620	4999620	I didn't even know that.
5001620	5003620	I also play a lot of Skyrim.
5004620	5006620	Plates of Minecraft, although I'm not good at Minecraft.
5007620	5010620	Yeah, I'm going to mow you guys down at a convention, by the way.
5010620	5016620	So like, although as Strani mentioned, we were kind of gypped by that place, which really sucked.
5016620	5019620	Like I really wanted to do the convention.
5020620	5025620	But hopefully next year, or maybe, you know, another convention pops up.
5025620	5027620	Hades, I want to play Hades.
5027620	5028620	I want to play Hades.
5028620	5029620	Do you mod Skyrim?
5029620	5030620	Yes.
5030620	5032620	Although I played it on mod at first.
5035620	5037620	I was recently playing Oblivion as well.
5040620	5044620	We're going to be playing Vampire of the Masquerade at the end of the week.
5045620	5048620	And we are turning those boobs up.
5049620	5051620	I want to play more retro games.
5051620	5052620	Travel.
5052620	5053620	I want to do Off Club with the Girls.
5053620	5054620	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5055620	5071620	And then if you are a streamer or a Vtuber watching this, please, just because I'm a lewd ASMR creator, please do not get off put on hanging out with me.
5071620	5072620	I don't bite.
5072620	5073620	I just feel bad.
5073620	5085620	I was, I knew that, like, for example, for the watch along stuff, like a lot of people were kind of going to snub us because of the content that we do, but we do do normal content on YouTube.
5085620	5089620	And then there are companies that are say so.
5089620	5098620	I'm doing air quotes that you cannot see that a backshot roulette that do worse than us.
5098620	5104620	So, like, I, I don't, I just want to be friends with people.
5104620	5109620	I want to, you know, branch out, network, help the other girls network.
5109620	5114620	It's, I probably won't have any collab set up for a bit just so I can get my bearings.
5114620	5118620	But what, no lewd tuba.
5118620	5119620	No, what are you talking about?
5119620	5122620	I'm the most holy and say so.
5122620	5129620	I don't know what you, I've, hold on, wait.
5129620	5137620	I am so say so from the head up.
5137620	5138620	Our nice Christian.
5138620	5140620	Yeah, I'm a good Christian girl.
5140620	5142620	You know, I was a nun.
5142620	5145620	You won't believe it, but I was a nun.
5145620	5147620	Is that too on the nose?
5148620	5152620	How long?
5152620	5155620	Short amount of time.
5155620	5159620	This is too class.
5159620	5164620	Beep, beep, beep, beep.
5164620	5165620	Okay.
5165620	5167620	Is there my tags?
5167620	5169620	What do you guys want your fan name to be?
5169620	5172620	Because I don't know.
5172620	5174620	I don't know.
5174620	5175620	Hold on.
5175620	5181620	Let me, I'm on a hold on ventral cause moment I want to go into my notes on my phone.
5181620	5186620	And I'll tell you what I had for ideas at first.
5186620	5192620	So Strani initially came up with love bunnies and I'm like, that's too long.
5192620	5195620	And then I was like bumpkins cause I'm bum.
5195620	5198620	I'm a bumkin jackrabbit.
5198620	5200620	Cause yeah.
5200620	5204620	Excuse me whippersnappers cause I'm a hag and I have a whip.
5204620	5206620	Whaskley rabbits.
5206620	5211620	Do you know a group of rabbits is called a fluffle?
5211620	5216620	Fluffle bros, bun buddies, bum buddies.
5216620	5220620	But then the other day it came to me in a dream.
5220620	5222620	Harem.
5222620	5225620	Harem.
5225620	5227620	Harem.
5227620	5230620	You are my harem.
5231620	5233620	Shibbatees.
5233620	5235620	Shibbatees toilets.
5235620	5240620	Or I was also thinking harlets but like spell it like hairlets.
5240620	5243620	You are my harlets.
5243620	5245620	Or I could be, yeah or harem.
5245620	5249620	So the nun bun, yeah that's not going to flow.
5249620	5253620	Fluffers, you know those fluffles on Club Penguin.
5253620	5257620	So I didn't realize that's probably where they got the name from.
5257620	5260620	Alright let's do a vote, let's do a vote.
5260620	5262620	I don't know how to do that.
5262620	5263620	Start a poll.
5263620	5265620	Okay, ask a question.
5265620	5267620	What name?

5339620	5344620	Although I already say a lot of bad things.
5344620	5346620	You're not my dom-
5346620	5347620	You're not doming me.
5347620	5349620	I'm doming you.

5419620	5420620	I heard French accent.
5420620	5422620	If you like sweet tea.
5422620	5426620	I can do a French accent as well.
5426620	5428620	It is not as good.
5429620	5434620	My name is Shibi Kotemban.
5434620	5439620	I would like to fuck you in the ass.
5439620	5441620	Yes.
5445620	5446620	Sweet tea.

5448620	5450620	I live in France.
5454620	5455620	Hi Amy.
5455620	5457620	Amy is like shut up.
5458620	5460620	I think Amy speaks Quebecois.
5460620	5461620	So.
5461620	5463620	The sac les bleus.
5463620	5465620	On les deux fromage.
5466620	5469620	Do you know how I do the French accent?
5469620	5475620	I think of Lumière from the beauty and the beast.
5475620	5478620	All I have to do is in my head say
5478620	5480620	Don't you know she is the one.
5480620	5481620	And then I can do it.
5481620	5483620	Je dors madame.
5483620	5484620	You better.
5484620	5485620	Croissant.
5486620	5488620	I am not Canadian.
5489620	5491620	All from fucking America.
5491620	5492620	Fuck yeah.

5494620	5496620	Anyways.
5498620	5500620	French-
5500620	5502620	I have that je ne sais quoi.
5505620	5507620	Beauty and the beast is front.
5507620	5508620	Are you kidding me right now?
5508620	5510620	Are you kidding me right now?
5512620	5514620	Finish the sentence.
5516620	5519620	We got some Canadians.
5519620	5521620	We got some Europeans.
5521620	5523620	We got them all.
5524620	5526620	Do you see Los Muthrobs?
5526620	5527620	Yes.
5527620	5528620	Actually no.
5528620	5530620	I don't like musicals in Brooklyn.
5530620	5532620	I am walking here.
5532620	5535620	But when I do a Brooklyn accent
5535620	5538620	I just start sounding like I am from Jersey.
5539620	5543620	Or I can sound like your Jewish aunt.
5543620	5545620	You know your brother was a doctor.
5546620	5547620	You know.
5549620	5551620	Uncle did that once.
5551620	5552620	Bastard.
5552620	5554620	Pack the fucking kind.
5554620	5555620	Have a yard kid.
5555620	5556620	I swear to God.
5556620	5558620	Do not come at me with that shit.
5558620	5559620	Alabama.
5561620	5562620	I fuck my sister.
5565620	5566620	That's Alabama accent.
5566620	5567620	I can't do Austrian.
5569620	5571620	Australian is one I can't do
5571620	5574620	because I just end up sounding British.

5583620	5584620	Run.
5586620	5587620	Oh boy.

5674620	5676620	You think you are thinking I am joking.
5676620	5678620	You are thinking I am not even going to put on toggles.
5678620	5680620	Because that will just be stupid.
5681620	5683620	If you hurt these girls feelings.
5684620	5686620	If you make them cry.
5687620	5689620	If you leave a bad comment.

5717620	5718620	But.

5778620	5779620	We're the first two people.
5779620	5780620	She was accepted before me.
5782620	5783620	And he wrote my eyes.
5783620	5784620	Because I'm crying.

5807620	5809620	Also one of the most fucking talented people she told me.
5809620	5811620	She's like I applied to other companies.
5811620	5812620	And they said.
5813620	5814620	No.
5814620	5815620	And I'm like huh.
5816620	5817620	She could play piano.

5854620	5855620	Thick as thieves.
5855620	5856620	It's bad.
5858620	5859620	We're bad together.
5859620	5861620	We're so fucking toxic.
5861620	5862620	But in a good way.
5862620	5863620	In terms of like.
5864620	5865620	Like we're just like.

5881620	5882620	And then.
5882620	5884620	She'll just be like fuck those hoes.
5884620	5885620	And I'm like.
5885620	5886620	Oh my thing died again.
5886620	5888620	Cause I'm just so excited talking about mercy.
5890620	5891620	And.
5893620	5894620	I just like she just cheers me up.
5894620	5896620	I remember I forget what happened.
5897620	5898620	I think.
5899620	5902620	I was worried about like I said before like my job interview with.
5902620	5903620	Going to their job.
5903620	5905620	And she's like you're going to fucking get this shit.
5905620	5906620	Fuck.
5907620	5909620	And like you know mercy might be coming off as shot.
5909620	5910620	She's not.
5910620	5911620	She's just warming up.
5912620	5913620	I'll tell you that right now.
5915620	5916620	She.

5919620	5920620	She she's also ride or die.
5920620	5921620	I'll tell you that right now.
5921620	5923620	She was everybody's perfect castings.
5924620	5925620	Perfect castings.
5925620	5926620	I wouldn't.
5927620	5928620	Think of.
5929620	5931620	Another way to cast any of them.
5931620	5932620	Cause people are like.
5932620	5934620	Oh it's this person's this person's this person's this person's.
5934620	5938620	And then like everything just fell into place perfectly.
5939620	5940620	And.
5941620	5942620	They're just.
5942620	5944620	I'm so glad that it's them.
5944620	5945620	Like they're.

5992620	5994620	I'm gonna have it cover you guys.
5994620	5996620	My voice is gone.
5996620	5998620	My neighbors are walking by again.
5998620	5999620	Put it right there.
6001620	6003620	We're going to go quick through these because it only got like.
6004620	6005620	40 minutes.
6005620	6006620	Do you have permission to fluff my ears?
6006620	6007620	No.
6007620	6009620	Do not touch me unless I give you permit.
6009620	6010620	Well actually.
6010620	6012620	You did ask permission but no.
6014620	6017620	Is it true that looking rabbits hold on a second.
6017620	6018620	Let me just.
6019620	6020620	I'm like looking wrong.
6027620	6028620	There we go.
6028620	6029620	Now I'm facing the right direction.
6030620	6032620	Is it true that looking a rabbit's foot brings good luck?
6032620	6033620	Yes.
6034620	6036620	You during some sessions.
6037620	6041620	I know I have people travel far and wide just to lick my feet.
6041620	6043620	Because I'm pretty good luck.
6044620	6045620	Yeah.
6045620	6047620	They think it's like oh if I have a rabbit's foot.
6048620	6049620	It's.
6050620	6053620	Licking a rabbit's foot is the correct terminology by the way.
6056620	6059620	I heard that you're a distant relative of Jessica Rabbit.
6059620	6061620	Of who framed your rabbit fame.
6061620	6064620	Could you please say in your hottest voice.

6076620	6078620	That was bad but my voice is going so.
6080620	6081620	As a rabbit are you big.
6081620	6082620	Are you scared of big hawks.
6083620	6084620	No.
6085620	6086620	They'll punch a hawk.
6089620	6090620	I'm not bad.
6091620	6092620	I'm not bad.
6093620	6094620	I'm just drawn that way.
6095620	6096620	That was bad but my voice is going so.
