You

13
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:25,440
Sorry, I'm making sure my controller isn't broken. Hello. Hi

14
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,440
No, he's not innocent

15
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,440
You guys need to stop defending him

16
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,440
Stop defending boomi from his actions

17
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,440
I'm very tired

18
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,440
Hi, have you come back over to apologize boomi?

19
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,440
Nope, he tweaked out and ran away

20
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,440
That's one does

21
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,440
I just woke up from a nap. I almost overslept

22
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,440
I don't I can't really test it right now because

23
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,440
What's it called

24
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,440
The game is still finalizing shaders and stuff. I didn't know that was a thing

25
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,440
So

26
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,440
Hi, hello, I'm I'm a little

27
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,440
Tired and low energy today

28
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,440
Shark Week is kicking my butt

29
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,440
Have a little bit of a headache from when I woke up

30
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,440
I don't know maybe it's left too long

31
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,440
I'm fine. I'm just like

32
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,440
Hi Raiders. Hi. Hello

33
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,440
Oh my god

34
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,440
Hello

35
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,440
Hello

36
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,440
Hi

37
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,440
Hey she be

38
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,440
I read that as hey she be very haram

39
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,440
Sorry, that's my son in the background

40
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:12,440
You guys see why I want to get another cat to hope hopefully help with that

41
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:18,440
Am I doing well otherwise you have fine. I had some Indian food for lunch. It was quite tasty

42
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,440
I have some water next to me

43
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,440
I can't open this okay

44
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,440
This uh this this this shaker cup is like hard to open for some reason

45
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,440
Dude

46
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,440
Why are you doing this when I start streaming?

47
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,440
Oh

48
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,440
And if it doesn't help

49
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:54,440
Well, it would be it's a foster to adopt if you guys don't know what I'm people are talking about in the chat

50
00:09:54,440 --> 00:10:00,440
I'm considering getting another cat for boomi to have a playmate because fia is

51
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,440
Disabled and rain is older and she doesn't want to play with them

52
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:10,440
So I was looking into getting another male cat boomi's age and there was this beautiful

53
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,440
Snowshoe ragdoll Siamese mix and his name is Asher

54
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,440
But I want to name him blithe to keep up the

55
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,440
The Elden Ring thing and apparently he's a sweetheart

56
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,440
So I don't think he would be

57
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,440
Influenced by boomi

58
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,440
But it's a possibility it could be a possibility

59
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,440
The cat is not a fit for us

60
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:40,440
I did send in an email I did uh

61
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,440
Apply to the application form

62
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:50,440
Um and that's the only reason why I'm giving it a try because I'm not going to adopt

63
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:56,440
A cat with this current situation if it was a little bit if fia wasn't the way that she was

64
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,440
I would probably just adopt and not foster before I adopt

65
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:06,440
Um but I want to make sure that uh a cat another another cat can fit into kind of to

66
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:14,440
Our routine and our lifestyle and be able to match boomi's energy but like be a more level headed one

67
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:20,440
Um but yeah so yeah he needs a purple officer not a playmate

68
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:28,440
Uh yeah I am not someone who I get pets and I would just rehouse them

69
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:32,440
Um

70
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,440
Boomi please um

71
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,440
Even more cat hair yeah he's a he's a longer haired cat I've never had a longer haired

72
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,440
Cat before but it doesn't matter either way short haired cats all the short haired

73
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,440
Cats I owned shed as much as long haired cats

74
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,440
Um sorry he's

75
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,440
Tokyo drifting around the house right now um

76
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:02,440
Funny as well no don't don't get me wrong reina and fia like boomi

77
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:08,440
Fia would love to play with boomi I can see the pain in her eyes right now she's right by my feet as she's watching

78
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:14,440
Boomi zoom around the house um because she can't run with him she can't play with him

79
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:18,440
And I don't know if that's going to be a consistent thing

80
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:24,440
Um fia might be paralyzed for the rest of her life so

81
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:32,440
On that note I am just um coming up with a way for everyone to be happy

82
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,440
Um

83
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:40,440
And so yeah it's uh

84
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,440
It's a little hard to kind of swallow that possibility

85
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,440
Um

86
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,440
What it is what it is

87
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:58,440
So I just want to do what's best for everybody

88
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:06,440
And if that other cat is not a fit then you know I want to make sure that that cat goes to another good home

89
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:12,440
But there's nothing that like I like fia had her issues quite fast

90
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:18,440
After I got her um I was already so attached to her at the hip

91
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:24,440
I wasn't going to just return her to the rescuer I was going to put in the effort to make sure she gets better

92
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:30,440
Um I didn't say but the last vet appointment

93
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:44,440
They don't think fia has um the disease that they thought she did so

94
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:48,440
I will be moving forward with an MRI

95
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:54,440
And if that doesn't help

96
00:13:54,440 --> 00:14:02,440
Then I will be moving forward with a muscle biopsy to at least document and for future pet owners

97
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:08,440
Um who may run into this issue because fia is a very special case

98
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:13,440
Um they have not seen her type of issue before

99
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:19,440
So I want to make sure it's properly documented

100
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,440
She could have a literally a brand new disease that nobody knows about

101
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:29,440
Um but she does recover don't get me wrong guys

102
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:35,440
Like I'm not saying that fia is gonna fucking die she's not dying

103
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,440
Um she's not dying

104
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:45,440
It's just this it's taking her a long time to get better

105
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,440
So it's hard on me before it took a month

106
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:55,440
Now it's taking

107
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,440
Now it's taking almost three months

108
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:05,440
Um fia is my cat fia is one of my three cats

109
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:11,440
She is a one-year-old simies cat mix with some sort of muscular neuropathy

110
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,440
Where she can't move her body

111
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:19,440
Um they were pretty sure it was miscellaneous before but now they're not so sure

112
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:25,440
So yeah um

113
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:33,440
I'm sorry I just I've been just kind of I've been talking to the vet today about it so it's it's been a kind of a tough day

114
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,440
Uh I apologize if you've come into the raid

115
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:45,440
Uh and it's more of a somber mood I'm very very sorry I am in a more somber mood today

116
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,440
Um

117
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,440
Yeah and that's I don't really know what else to say about that

118
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,440
Um thank you I appreciate the you know

119
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,440
Oh you don't have to

120
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:07,440
Guys you don't you you you wait I have like the 3d o going at the same time and there's an echo

121
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:15,440
Oh my god um you guys like don't donate because I'm telling you this please

122
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,440
Um

123
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:25,440
Yeah I don't know how much an MRI is gonna cost um I already it's probably gonna be like

124
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:31,440
So probably a portion of my donathan money will be going to the MRI

125
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:37,440
Um I already have money saved for the biopsy I've been saving money for that

126
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,440
Biopsy is three thousand dollars

127
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:49,440
Um I'm a little bit nervous to do that because they would you know it's a legit surgery so they'd have to put her under anesthesia and stuff so

128
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,440
Um

129
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,440
Yeah she will recover it's just taking so much longer

130
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:06,440
Uh she stretched out her back legs this morning um she can stretch out her front legs but she can't hold herself up she can't stand she can't

131
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:14,440
Really do a lot of things on her own and I'm fine with like I'm fine with taking care of her she is my baby I do not that does not matter to me

132
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:19,440
It's more so I see the frustration in her face when I like again she can't

133
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:23,440
Thank you I appreciate it anonymous anonymous

134
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:31,440
When she cannot get up and she cannot run with her brother it just it hurts um

135
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:41,440
Well she's still happy I was I was playing with her this morning I discovered she really likes this mouse silver vine toy so I've been playing with her with that

136
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:49,440
Just to keep her engaged so she's not bored just laying on the couch and me flipping her over every hour like a little pancake that she is

137
00:17:49,440 --> 00:18:02,440
Um and yeah she's right by my feet right now I bet if I if I gave her a couple pets he'd start purring she's still she's still she's still in good spirits

138
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:08,440
Um Reina I don't know where Reina went actually she was Reina's been snuggling with me all morning

139
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,440
Because Reina always strength senses when I'm very stressed out um

140
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:22,440
Boomi as you can hear in the background is spazzing out but it seems like he's fine and settled on the cat tree now I was just looking at him

141
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,440
Uh but yes thank you anonymous um

142
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:30,440
Yes life back companion um

143
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,440
So a part of me wanting to get another cat is kind of just like

144
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:43,440
Me wanting to be happy and another part is for Boomi's sake um

145
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:50,440
And I have enough space I know I I um just want to be my first rodeo adopting a cat

146
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:57,440
Because I have adopted Boomi and Fia and I would be able to sequester them in my bedroom make sure they're all nice and neat

147
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:04,440
I have a plethora of dishes and bowls and mats and I have have another litter box so it's it would all be fine

148
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:12,440
Um yeah and who knows I might not if I get denied for the application

149
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:18,440
Um I'm not gonna try again for a bit just because um

150
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:27,440
I know that cat had a look to him I'm just like I feel kinship with this cat just like when I saw Boomi and Fia I was just like

151
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,440
Yeah we're meant to be together

152
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:40,440
Um but yeah uh sorry I'm yapping because I'm also waiting for black with wukong to download the shaders

153
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:46,440
Um I think it's done now um it's also just frustrating because um

154
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:55,440
With what happened with Amy's channel this morning was very disheartening she works really hard and she doesn't deserve to have her channel

155
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:02,440
Um yanked off the face of the internet over nothing for whatever reason

156
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,440
Uh I don't know why it happens could be AI could be mass reporting

157
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,440
Could be YouTube scrutinizing her because she's now a larger channel

158
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:22,440
Because like me personally I I I've been I've been getting kind of away with murder in my ASMR streams

159
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:28,440
And I don't I haven't got like I'll get limited and then I'll appeal and then it's fine

160
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:36,440
Um but I just I don't know what's up with like Amy's stuff that that would happen

161
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:44,440
Um I'm strutty's a smart cookie and then she's taking care of it along with the rest of our management

162
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:50,440
Um it's in their hands uh I don't know the details at all

163
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:56,440
Uh I don't know if Strani is like talked about it in her stream

164
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:06,440
Um if she did I bet hopefully she gave some more reassurance I haven't really talked to her today

165
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:15,440
Uh besides a couple messages in the discord um of me I just literally said the Spongebob inside Spongebob's brain

166
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,440
The office on fire like that one like all the Spongebob's are running around

167
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,440
I'm like what the fuck's going on that was that was that's that was my contribution

168
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:30,440
Because I just I freak out at stuff um and then again I'm a very emotional person so

169
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:37,440
She talked at you okay she already reassured you cool nice

170
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,440
50k subs regain a little month yeah

171
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:50,440
Yeah and so um yeah no Amy knows Amy knows that we're with her I talked with her this morning

172
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:57,440
We talked about it I gave her a virtual hug um because she it's very stressful

173
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:05,440
Um just imagine like a good chunk of the work you do is gone because an AI says so

174
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:11,440
Even though you literally try to bend to the whim of said AI and said company

175
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:18,440
And still follow and comply with TOS but they remove you anyways it's very disheartening

176
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:32,440
Um because again she Amy Amy's been a streamer for a while she's also um her PL like

177
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:38,440
She she knows what she's doing and she knows how things work so it's not like she was

178
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:49,440
Like me or or I see trying to bait the AI be like ooh come and get me um no it's just um yeah I just

179
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:55,440
I don't know I just I just leave it up to to strong you

180
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,440
What else was I gonna say I forget

181
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:06,440
Amy didn't get a strike she got her channel removed and it's funny there was no third strike

182
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:13,440
Uh Strani told us right off the rip when we first started don't even like

183
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:21,440
If you like you she's like forget about the warning system this is like literally when we first got into veal or

184
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:27,440
Uh she's like forget about the warning system it's dog shit like it's not real

185
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:35,440
She's like people have their channels just taken down no strikes no issues no warnings it doesn't matter

186
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:43,440
YouTube just does that but so does and then people I know people um are probably like oh why don't you guys just go to twitch

187
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:51,440
Strani has explained and I've even explained many times why as a corporation as an agency we do not

188
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:59,440
Operate on twitch it is easier for payout um to do stuff on YouTube from a company standpoint

189
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:07,440
Uh and just making sure everything is fine the twitch is a little bit a lot more difficult in that

190
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:15,440
Not that it can't it isn't possible um so like it'd be cool if like Amy gets to stream on there

191
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:21,440
Or you know or like stream via space I know she'll come up with something to stay connected

192
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:32,440
That's for sure um but yeah it's twitch is also kind of similar in which they'll just take vtubers down

193
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:47,440
Um and asmr is also not safe on twitch as well so um but yeah uh thank you thank you guys

194
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:56,440
Yeah she got she got she got nuked off the face of the interwebs for some stupid reason um but yeah

195
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:04,440
Oh yeah that's it's just been a it's been a day it's been a day it's been a day for other people it's been a day for me

196
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:16,440
So I just want to chill and just play some monkey game you know like let's do it um what time is it?

197
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,440
Almost 4.26

198
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:26,440
What am I doing tomorrow? I don't remember um yeah chill and monkey monkey and chill

199
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:34,440
They literally banned me off after second strike because of gummy worms

200
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:38,440
I thought and from my understanding and I could be wrong don't call me on this

201
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:44,440
The second strike was the gummy worms there was no third strike they just banned her

202
00:25:48,440 --> 00:26:02,440
I am choking on an ice cube within my water return to monkey

203
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:14,440
Zero strikes precisely that's why I'm like uh and like like I'm I've been fine doing asmr and like and my videos are fine

204
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:18,440
Minus the fact I'm gonna let you win a little secret

205
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:30,440
So um me and Strani noticed that my latest asmr video is performing extremely poorly

206
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:40,440
And uh and not because I believe like my other asmr's got to a certain amount and certain amount of impressions within a certain amount of time

207
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:46,440
And um Strani was like is it because you're tan now?

208
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:52,440
And I'm like oh my god you're right I was actually just denied from a rigor I think because of my tan

209
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:58,440
Um when I was inquiring about 2.0 stuff um a rigor said they don't do my type of model

210
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:06,440
And I looked at their work and I'm like but you have done that type of model

211
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:10,440
So maybe it's because I'm tan I don't know

212
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:16,440
Um so Strani's running a little thing where she's doing a thumbnail test where it's

213
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:22,440
The thumbnail as me is my pale model thumbnails means my tan model and then like with and without text

214
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:30,440
Just to see if like that um but like do you guys remember

215
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:42,440
Corey Kench is still right to this day do you guys remember um there was like a thread on twitter about how twitter suppresses

216
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:48,440
Like uh like if there's like a black person or a black character in a tweet

217
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:58,440
But there's a white person it'll automatically save it to the white person I don't know if you got I was dying laughing at that because they put like

218
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:06,440
10 of the same black person and then one white dude and just focused on the white dude each time and then they made the black dude

219
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:14,440
And then they made him like but except they made it like they photoshopped him to be pale and then it worked and I was just laughing so hard

220
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:21,440
And I'm like it's literally like it could be algorithm I'll go I'll go with rhythmic I can't say the word algorithmic I don't know

221
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:27,440
Or I could be in my fucking head I'm not the type of person to be like it's because I'm black so don't get me wrong

222
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:35,440
It's not that it's just interesting observation how AI works and what they want to push to you if it's the case it could totally not be the case

223
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:42,440
It could be in my head of that rigor then maybe the rigor does looked at my model was just like no actually it is like I just don't like the model style

224
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:46,440
Then that could be the case but you know like I'm just saying

225
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,440
I

226
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,640
Cue the darman

227
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:04,440
I'm working in the matter moment 99% my mom so my mom came back with with my dad from the beach

228
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:09,440
I still need to set up the freaking collab with my parents but I'm busy and they're busy

229
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,440
It's my BGM to fucking loud

230
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,440
Just turn that down a smidge um

231
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,440
And my mom came back so much darker than me and I'm like

232
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:37,440
She's like I'm I'm blacker than my black daughter and I'm like I'm gonna punch you mom I'm gonna literally just like I'm going

233
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,440
I'm going to fight you

234
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,440
I'm like I'm leaving my dad just laugh if you guys don't know

235
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,440
My mom is white my dad is black my dad is very dark skin

236
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,440
My mom is white and I am tan

237
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:57,440
But I'm very pale because they haven't been outside all summer or the last summer because I'm a freaking closeted neat or whatever the fuck

238
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,440
I don't know I'm a hickamory

239
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,440
And but then I laughed at her because she also kind of had a sunburn so I flicked her in the chest

240
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,440
Because I'm a shitty child and

241
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:19,440
Yeah, so it was it was funny, but it's like it's also funny because like my model isn't that much tan

242
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,440
If you really look at my model, I'm not

243
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,440
That much tan

244
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:34,440
And I'm like maybe yeah, so it's just very interesting and I'm like do I make my 2.0 white do I just like

245
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,440
Be like I don't care whoa

246
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:46,440
It's just like this smart. Yeah, I'm like my headphones and I haven't put them in yet. Let me turn on desktop audio

247
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,440
I think there will be good

248
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:10,440
Yeah, just have but like then I scold my mother I'm like I haven't been outside you're outside literally every day

249
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:16,440
She's in her garden. She's going to the beach. She's going on doing stuff. I am in my house all the time

250
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,440
I'm a gamer mom. It's not a phase

251
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,440
And my mom is Portuguese

252
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,440
So like

253
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,440
So that the Portuguese skin becoming in handy

254
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,440
You set up that porch stuff

255
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,440
No

256
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,440
I was going to do it this morning, you know, it's all out my balcony. I'm just staring at it

257
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,440
Oh, thank you. Thank you

258
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:59,440
Wait, I forgot to say welcome in Portuguese

259
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,440
My mom's not Brazilian Portuguese though. She's Portugal Portuguese

260
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,440
From the Azores he says

261
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,440
I'm going to press class a gamer

262
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:21,440
I guess it worked for Michael Jackson Michael Jackson had little I go and then he bleached his skin because he was too self-conscious about it

263
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:33,440
And then he just had an existential crisis because he is was mentally ill and like kids but that that's that's I'm not the same as that

264
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,440
I'm not the same as that

265
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:39,440
I thought my outfits get screwed. No, no, yeah, no man

266
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,440
That's fine

267
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,440
I can I can

268
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,440
I can do that

269
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:57,440
If you're new here I can cover up surprise if you didn't know that already and I haven't used my like own models outfits in a while

270
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,440
But I was like I because I like to dress up for you guys

271
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:09,440
I just couldn't be but I'm like I don't really have anything so I'll usually like get an outfit to match what I'm doing and I'm like I don't

272
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:14,440
I don't think I have an outfit to match me playing black myth moocom

273
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:23,440
Unless I like poorly cosplay as like a Chinese mythological person

274
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,440
And I'm like that doesn't seem right. So let me not do that

275
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:44,440
Although I personally love Chinese mythology in a very dark period in my life. All I did was watch Chinese dramas and they're wonderful

276
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,440
And I think the Chinese language is beautiful

277
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:58,440
It was very fun watching. What was it called? Hold on. I can't even remember what it was called popular Chinese fantasy drama

278
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,440
It was on Netflix

279
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:12,440
It was about a lot of these are very similar

280
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,440
And I've seen most a lot of them

281
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,440
Did I watch the last immortal? No

282
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,440
Because a lot of these have to do with like fairies and spirits

283
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:36,440
Oh my god, this is gonna bother me. It was on Netflix. It was so oh eternal love

284
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,440
No ashes of love. It was ashes of love ashes of love

285
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,440
Oh my god. Hold on. I will

286
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,440
Let me just hold on

287
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,440
Where's my window capture

288
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,440
I

289
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:10,440
Amazing by the way, let's just amazing cast

290
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,440
Very cool

291
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,440
Highly yes, it's usually it's usually

292
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,440
I

293
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,440
Need to

294
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:37,440
Journey to the West I like I know literally journey to the West is what wukong is from or like the monkey king and all that stuff

295
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,440
The costumes the costuming in Chinese dramas are so cool

296
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,440
Ow, I just how

297
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,440
Why do I feel like I just got bit by something on my fucking eyebrow out

298
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,440
Hello

299
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:05,440
Do I like a zit I can't tell how it hurt is like a drama

300
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:10,440
Yeah, I used to I used to really like k-dramas as well. I haven't really watched any k-dramas in a while though

301
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:17,440
But I literally was just like sad because I was alone so I like to live I like to live

302
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:23,800
Superficially through Chinese fantasy characters like their saga like him

303
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:30,440
She was annoying as hell this character. She was annoying as hell. There was another dude. Oh

304
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,080
My god, he's not in this poster though

305
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:38,720
He was kind of whiny and annoying I

306
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:45,640
Can't find where's the other dude. There's another dude. I forget what he think he's like part dragon or some shit

307
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:50,800
He was cool. He like played a flute or whatever the fuck

308
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,080
him

309
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,960
He was cool

310
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,960
No, it was him. Oh wait. No, this is the same picture just in cut in half

311
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,960
Yeah, I

312
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:09,720
Also just like look at their beautiful wigs. They're beautiful wigs and hair

313
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:18,520
You know just like how can I how can I not she be spider? No

314
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:24,240
No, I don't fucking mites and spiders in my eyebrow. Oh, I haven't showered. No

315
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:31,520
It's not like that. It's not like that. I it's not like that. I showered a couple days. Wait, what did I shower? I

316
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:39,200
Showered on Sunday. I showered on Sunday, okay?

317
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,560
All right, let's help her poor I

318
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,560
I

319
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,400
Leave me alone

320
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:58,360
Wait, what day is it today today's Tuesday? It's only been like three two days

321
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:12,720
That one small I'm not stinky I'm not pun maybe actually hold on. Oh, yeah

322
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,560
I take that back

323
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,120
You know, it's it's a very interesting

324
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,160
Because

325
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:39,080
Because so as some of you guys know I did I grew out my armpit hair because I never grew I usually

326
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:44,160
Always shave like every other day and this time I'm like, you know

327
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:50,960
I don't feel like shaving let me not shave and I didn't shave for probably like a month my armpits

328
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:57,960
Because I was just going on natural and I didn't smell or sweat

329
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,000
No armpit hair made me smell less

330
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,840
They made me it made me smell less I didn't sweat as much

331
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,120
Could you braid your hair? No

332
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,840
Remove it then, please

333
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:26,440
You did smell no no because I would smell my armpits

334
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:33,160
And it was fine and I noticed I didn't sweat as much now I sweat a lot

335
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:38,720
I can I literally have sweat stains on my shirt will not sweat stains. It's just like I'm a little wet cuz my

336
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,280
Um

337
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,240
Interesting I should probably take a shower

338
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,920
No, I'm pretty sure and so I'm like

339
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:06,640
I'm like, does this happen to guys that they sweat less cuz they don't they don't

340
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,720
The armpit hair was hiding my funk. Maybe I don't know

341
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,240
I

342
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:19,900
My nose wiggles my yeah, yeah, that's me wiggling my nose

343
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,860
Pheromone I'm pheromone maxing. Okay, I

344
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:33,640
Was listen I was tired and I said I was gonna take a shower, but I just went to sleep

345
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,720
You get sit

346
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:45,560
One time I woke up cuz my mom my mom always made fun of me cuz I'd sometimes sleeps with my arms above my head

347
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:52,280
Like I'm about to do like YMCA and I woke up cuz something was tickling me and it was feel licking my armpit

348
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,280
I

349
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,280
Sleep with no shower

350
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,280
Then just makes your sheets funky

351
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:11,960
I fell asleep on the couch because I like to rotate my sleeping spots like a cat cuz I'm weird

352
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,320
I've been sleeping on my couch for the last two days

353
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:21,320
Cuz I'm a very comfy couch. She's yeah, she's strong

354
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,280
Fia tries to groom me cuz she knows my stink

355
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:33,720
Yeah, I'm like I don't know why cats like that so

356
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Yeah

357
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:42,840
But yeah, I need to I need to rotate my sleeping spots that I should wash my sheets

358
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,840
That's definitely something I should do

359
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,440
especially cuz I just like

360
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,760
This is my cat sleep with me and they track their little gross litter stuff everywhere

361
00:41:53,280 --> 00:42:01,920
It's nice I I or I just ordered to be a little bit more organized like a little a trash can specifically for my cats shit and piss

362
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,800
So I don't have to have it just sitting in my own personal trash can

363
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:15,880
Sometimes I put that's why I wanted the human dog bed cuz I literally I slept on the human dog bed for literally almost a month

364
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,880
And it was fine and then I moved it to my couch

365
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,120
Don't you I don't use a three-in-one

366
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:34,680
Why I'm surprised nobody has gotten through their head yet that it's because I'm mentally ill

367
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,680
They haven't showered

368
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:42,320
Someone asked me earlier. How am I holding up? I could be better

369
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:49,000
And not it. No, don't get me wrong. I'm not like oh, I want to kill myself. Oh, no, it's not like that

370
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,880
It's more so just like laziness as like some depression can be

371
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,200
um

372
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:01,560
And so oh, don't worry madam. We know we know you are fucked up. No, I'm not even

373
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:09,080
It's just like it's so like and it's honestly my fault because I haven't I've just been neglecting my own personal health

374
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,240
By trying to do things that give me serotonin, but they're not doing it

375
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:17,440
And I just remembered I didn't take my meds for the past two days, so I'm gonna go do that right now

376
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,280
Oh

377
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:34,120
It's also just I can't stay focused

378
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:39,920
My friends like it's because you have ADHD and I'm like, but I'm not diagnosed and she's like well

379
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,640
You should probably be on a different medication and get that checked out

380
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:47,760
But then I missed my psychiatry appointment and then I haven't talked to my therapist still

381
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,520
Yeah, it's been a it's been a time

382
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,800
I accidentally swallowed an ice cube and I was trying to swallow my pill

383
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:12,040
But hey, I've been worse at one point I didn't leave my house for six months because I had agoraphobia

384
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,320
So I'm doing pretty good. I'd like to say

385
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,320
She be quitting hitting my life

386
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:22,920
Yeah, it's like it's I could be doing better, but I'm not

387
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,680
No, I wasn't chewing on my pills

388
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:33,920
Finally, I just popped I just popped a little bit of sertraline a hundred milligrams

389
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:37,240
That's Zoloft for you normies out there

390
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:44,240
And that helps me and makes me get out of my house. Otherwise I become so scared. I can't leave

391
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:49,360
I'm slow, but steady. Yeah, it's like I

392
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,280
don't

393
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,640
I'm in this

394
00:44:54,680 --> 00:45:00,040
And I know I feel like this is like a you're gonna be my therapist for a second. Tell me if I'm wrong. I

395
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:05,880
Have been told there's a symptom of this like you need you want to do stuff

396
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:10,480
But you freeze and you just get locked into the cycle procrastination and freezing

397
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,720
But wanting to do something that can't have the motivation to do it

398
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:20,520
Um, and apparently that's a symptom of ADHD and so I'm like

399
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,960
I've been doing that a lot

400
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:36,200
No madam get tested. It's how do you feel about that? I feel like I have ADHD

401
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:44,080
Yes, hey, it's like

402
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:49,240
Yeah, it's not it's not that's not the only diagnostic criteria

403
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:56,840
I meet a lot of the criteria for ADHD. I've just never gotten tested for it. My mother never she tested me for autism. I

404
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:00,760
Think I don't know. I know I'm not autistic

405
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:08,760
Although my dad would constantly joke that I was because I guess I've told you guys this story before I used to work in human services

406
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,640
where I would help people with adults with

407
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:18,360
Behavioral issues and mental disabilities and physical disabilities and my dad said it was a ploy all along

408
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,920
For me to be going there

409
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:24,360
And then I wasn't working and I was actually an attendant

410
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Um

411
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:33,320
Yeah, I start a lot of stuff. I don't finish I procrastinate a lot. I can't focus

412
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,360
It's hard to self-motivate

413
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:46,200
Yeah, he cooked I'm afraid I know I am yes, we know you are I'm sorry

414
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Um

415
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:56,440
Yeah, this is also a possibility because like I I like I have OCD like I have I have this perfectionist state

416
00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:01,800
And I have to have things a certain way although I have the I have the form of OCD called ocpD

417
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:03,160
which is

418
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:07,400
obsessive compulsive personality disorder and has a lot to do with control and stuff

419
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,720
um

420
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:15,160
And then like I have dysthemia. So I've had that since I was a wee a wee lass

421
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:20,760
And see me as a smiled long-term depression. It comes and goes every few years. I haven't had anything for a few years

422
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,440
I don't feel depressed. I just feel like I don't know what to do with myself

423
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,800
Ah

424
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,400
Yeah, it's how do you get things done?

425
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,400
How do you get things done?

426
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:38,920
But it's funny because everybody's different because he's like you see strawny strawny is autism

427
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:44,040
But she is the autism that makes her want to do everything and she can just keep going forever

428
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,560
Excuse me

429
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:53,480
Did you get a lot of shot? Yeah, my my yeah, my dad definitely did that to me. Um, but I also think

430
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:58,840
Another reason why I think I might have it is because I'm sure my dad has it

431
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:03,400
It's different when I observe it in myself versus and I'm exactly like my father

432
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,440
We have so much of the same symptoms

433
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:11,640
So much it's a miracle my mom can put up with the both of us

434
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:14,680
um

435
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,760
I don't know how she did it

436
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,760
uh

437
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:23,640
Yeah, she's a superpower version. So I'm like I'm trying to force myself

438
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,400
to

439
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:30,040
One and it's funny because when I do something I feel so I have so much relief like I finally

440
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,120
had got just sat the fuck down and

441
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:39,160
Did all of my affordable housing stuff finally like, uh, I finished it all last week

442
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:44,520
I contacted everybody. I got all the right things and now I'm just waiting on them to tell me if I'm still missing

443
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,040
anything or not

444
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:48,040
and weaponized autism

445
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:54,840
And so like I have my spurts where I but then I get hyper focused and I can't have anything fucking distract like

446
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:58,040
I like if something distracts me

447
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:01,560
I'm gonna have a fucking meltdown if I get it interrupted

448
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:04,760
You know like I like this

449
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:08,040
Yeah

450
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,760
Uh

451
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:14,120
You're rude blood for autism

452
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,920
She'd be that slowly really

453
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:22,280
Like I don't know these and like my dad's the same way like we have to like

454
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,360
If we get interrupted if we get locked in if we get interrupted or if someone

455
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:32,680
If someone doesn't if we're communicating with someone they don't understand what we're saying and we're repeating ourselves and we're

456
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:35,400
The way like in our head it makes sense

457
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,480
But to anybody else it doesn't like me

458
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:42,840
Like I'll have to mediate sometimes between my parents and my mama lilies called me up

459
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:46,840
And she's like your dad has told me this but I don't really know what he's trying to tell me

460
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:51,080
And I'm like, oh, I think he's trying to tell you this and she's like

461
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:54,120
Oh, then why didn't he just say that? I'm like

462
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:57,240
Because we're meant to leave off like I don't

463
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:03,480
And that would that would explain a lot for my dad as well because my dad I mean my dad the same person except he's

464
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,360
a dude um

465
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,680
In six four

466
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:10,680
Inbalt I am not

467
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:14,040
And like I don't mind that

468
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,600
Yeah

469
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:22,360
And so like and I hurry what was it? I remember my pl. I like almost started crying

470
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:31,160
Because my chat on twitch had me do like the online adhd test where it's like the rad's test

471
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:33,960
And I scored

472
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,120
Hi

473
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:38,280
For for that's for autism though

474
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:46,840
Yeah, I hate repeating myself and I'm not going bald. She beats dad for gen three. My dad will be a dealer guys

475
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:50,360
um

476
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,040
and

477
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:58,680
It was just like more signs of adhd more like live adhd some signs of autism and I'm like

478
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:00,760
What?

479
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:06,760
Why did I score so high? I thought I was gonna score like 50 and I got like 200

480
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:12,760
Patient is still in denial about hair loss

481
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:17,400
Um

482
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,360
But yeah

483
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:23,720
So I should probably I think that would help me and that's why I'm wishing I didn't miss my last psychiatry appointment

484
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:29,320
Because I don't know how to go about getting tested because my therapy your therapist doesn't test you your therapist is

485
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:32,520
I just go to my therapist for cognitive behavioral therapy

486
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:33,720
um

487
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:36,680
Your psychiatry I have to be tested by a psychologist

488
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,160
so

489
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:43,080
I also can't adjust to things. I literally have something called adjustment disorder

490
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:50,840
When I turned 18 I had a mental breakdown because I turned 18 nothing happened. I just numbers

491
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,960
Uh

492
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:59,480
Isn't that funny

493
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:05,640
You know what guys I need your help

494
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:09,240
Uh, I'm gonna make my appointment right now. I'm gonna text my therapist

495
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:13,160
Tell me to tell me tell me right now to text my therapist and I'll do it

496
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:19,960
I need your help. I need you to tell this one time. I'm going to let you tell me what to do

497
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:25,400
Yeah, 56 was hard, but I hit 50. I lost it. Um

498
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:33,880
Patient needs the test

499
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:37,880
You're killing me dude. That's hilarious. All right. I'm gonna do it. I'll text you now

500
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:41,880
I need I sometimes I need something like I need a boost. I need to be reminded

501
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Hi, Cheryl

502
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,600
You

503
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:00,600
And do you have any sigh

504
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:04,360
ecology

505
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:07,320
Contacts

506
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,720
Uh

507
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,880
I am free Thursday

508
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:24,920
Therapist stream

509
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:31,320
Uh, I think that would be like a hip of violation if I had my therapist on stream. I've had my same therapist for

510
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,880
Quite some time. She is

511
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:37,560
Incredible. I talked to her off and on I used to see her like

512
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:40,440
Several times a week then once a week

513
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:46,680
Then once every two weeks then once a month and then I kind of like talked to her as needed now

514
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,640
um

515
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,240
So

516
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:53,240
She's she's she's been great

517
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:57,960
And it's funny because like your thing like oh, she's just stringing you along to like

518
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:03,160
So you pay your bills or like so she can just ring money out of you. No

519
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:09,720
My therapist is so fucking amazing. I haven't had to pair in the last three years

520
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:14,680
She's like I will figure a way to get it all the insurance

521
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:20,040
So I know my therapist does have my best interests at heart. She just doesn't do it for money

522
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:23,560
Um, that's how she she fucking rocks. Um

523
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:27,880
In the moment when I left my job, I was so anxious

524
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:33,400
I was so fucking anxious because they provided me insurance so that I could see my therapist

525
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,800
um

526
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:41,640
And I said, you know, I don't have insurance right now. She said don't even fucking worry about it. Just I'll figure something out

527
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:44,360
um

528
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,760
So she's a real one

529
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:50,840
If if you're someone out there, I like how we like for the first hour of my stream

530
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:55,480
We're just talking about mental health and I haven't even started the game yet, but let's do it. Um

531
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:02,280
There are extremely fucking shitty therapists out there. I will tell you that much

532
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:05,880
I've had a couple in my time that did not give a shit about me

533
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:10,680
They did just want me for a paycheck. They gas let me whatever the fuck you want to say

534
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:12,920
they were not girl bossing though

535
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:13,880
and

536
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:17,720
Dang those shaders. They're still haven't loaded yet. No, they have loaded. Um

537
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:20,680
And

538
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,680
It takes a while to find the right one

539
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,680
um

540
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:30,360
That actually will talk to you help you kind of unravel the mess the knotted yarn that is your mind

541
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:38,440
Uh, sometimes you need an unbiased opinion from someone that is not your parent your best friend your sibling

542
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
a relative

543
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:43,240
And you just talk at them

544
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:48,280
And that's why like streaming is almost therapy to me because I can just talk at you guys

545
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:54,600
And sometimes you talk and then you just realize as you're talking that stuff makes sense and you're like wait

546
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:58,600
Why the what and then they'll be and then they'll validate you they'll question you more

547
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:00,920
um

548
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:05,240
Preclaim yapping is a tradition. It's a standard. Yeah, it's a standard. Yeah, um

549
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:10,200
You do yeah, you gotta gotta keep dating honestly

550
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,200
Dude

551
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:18,440
Guys, I just thought of an app idea. Why isn't there a tinder for therapists? Hello?

552
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:24,360
Copyright copyright tm trademarked my idea

553
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,800
is called

554
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:31,560
They're a prinder no

555
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:41,400
Write it down write it down. Was that not better help? No better help sucks better help fucking sucks

556
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:45,400
Better help is this is a fucking scam

557
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:49,800
I I recommended better help to one of my friends

558
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:55,480
And then seeing what they went through on better help. It was a fucking shit show

559
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:58,440
No

560
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:00,600
Boomi. Yeah, boomi. Don't take my idea

561
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:06,120
Hold on. I want to check my that the nobody's messaged me back

562
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:11,480
Oh

563
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:18,920
Oh

564
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:23,320
Guys I'm tempted to

565
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:27,560
Get a garage

566
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:29,960
Because in my apartment we can get garages

567
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:33,160
And they have a few

568
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:36,440
And I might get a garage

569
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:43,640
Should I get a garage?

570
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:48,680
Especially for three oh true

571
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:51,080
I

572
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:56,760
Could get a garage for three because I live I live in New England it fucking snows like a bitch out here

573
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:59,160
I would like a garage

574
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:03,400
Because y'all know I'm not going outside and cleaning off my fucking car by myself

575
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:05,960
I had my dad come over and do it

576
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:11,080
Like once okay, it was mostly me. I had him do it once though because I'm like I can't do this

577
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,920
Garage here my garage

578
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:17,880
With my brand new Lamborghini

579
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:25,240
She be you barely go out where I can put the car in the garage

580
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:29,240
You know

581
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,720
Hold on. I'm gonna I'm gonna message her back

582
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:35,320
Hi

583
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:42,520
Do you have storage in garages available?

584
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:58,600
And how much are they? Because if they're like I don't know how much the garages are

585
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,800
I put

586
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:17,960
No, it's not what I I accidentally typed a funny number for my apartment, which is not what I meant to type

587
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,680
I

588
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:26,440
One billion dollars because I would be so smart. I could literally just go in the garage and do 3d in there

589
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:29,960
Because I don't have enough space in my house probably

590
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:35,800
Um, when I was I was asking the people I'm like, hey if I can't get my affordable housing

591
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:39,000
Can I just stay in the apartment and just pay normal market rate?

592
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:43,080
Which is $3,000 by the way. Um, and I can't do that

593
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:48,600
I I didn't know till afterwards that that's how much it was and um

594
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:54,360
They were like, no, you'd literally I'd have to move to a different unit within the building

595
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:56,600
and I'm like

596
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:58,440
I would

597
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:03,880
They're like, yeah, because you're affordable like you have the affordable unit like you would have to leave

598
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:08,760
And

599
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:11,240
Then you would have I would have to pay like

600
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:13,960
$3,000

601
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:17,960
For a one bedroom. I love new england

602
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:26,680
I know it'll be so weird because I probably like would go to the apartment that I used to live in and like

603
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:30,600
accidentally like because I usually run on autopilot. I don't think I just go

604
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:35,880
Um, you know when you like wake up in a place and you're like, how did I get here and you're like, oh, yeah, I drove

605
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:41,000
I think like that that would be me and so I would just like show up

606
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:46,200
And just like be trying to get into the apartment and they'll be like, what the fuck are you doing? I'd be like, oh, sorry

607
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:48,200
I used to live here. Um

608
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:56,920
Same in the yeah, the west coast and east coast they just suck. That's why I'm like, I should move down south

609
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:00,520
My family I have family that just moved to georgia

610
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:04,440
Uh, my grandparents live in florida and I'm just like

611
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:07,880
The devil went down to georgia. Hello

612
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:16,520
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. My uncle can play that on the fiddle. I'll tell you that right now

613
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:23,000
Um, please stop move down south we're full, fuck yeah

614
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:29,480
Empty bottle the first because autopilot, yeah

615
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:34,440
And then like I was just like I was thinking I'm like, oh

616
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:38,520
Like I like new england like I like having all four seasons and I'm like, oh

617
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:44,200
What if I like move to like Washington state just to cost the country and I'm like, no, that'd be terrible. I would cry

618
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:51,000
But like they're super expensive over there too like everywhere is expensive

619
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:56,360
I'm like, oh, what if I like but like Midwest like Colorado or something because I like I like mountains. I like winter

620
01:01:57,640 --> 01:01:59,640
um

621
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,800
And I'm just like yikes

622
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:06,120
Everything's expensive my rent for a two-bed apartment. I went up to 12

623
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,400
Are you crying about that price because I pay

624
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:18,840
1600 for a one bedroom apartment and I have like 700 square feet bro

625
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:22,840
You guys have sort of kind of I should probably do an apartment tour

626
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:27,320
You guys have sort of kind of seen how small my apartment is. It's all open concept

627
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:30,920
I like rain

628
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:38,120
I'm I don't live in the city. I don't like I don't live in a city. I just live in like a town. I don't

629
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:45,560
Oh, Michigan. Somebody told me Michigan. I had, I had a friend tell me Michigan

630
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:50,840
I pay. Yeah, exactly. If I didn't have affordable housing, I'd be paying $3,000

631
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:55,320
But because I get I don't make a lot and I'm under a certain

632
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:57,320
um

633
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:59,320
Amount that i make

634
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:05,720
Uh, that's why I can afford to live on my own otherwise I'd probably have to move back with my parents

635
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:08,440
um

636
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:17,520
Thankfully, I make maybe a little bit less than what I did at my last job.

637
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:22,000
Thanks to you guys, so thank you for keeping me alive.

638
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,000
People are moving to Colorado.

639
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:31,560
Yeah, one of my family friends who's in the military is going to Colorado.

640
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:36,240
Because it's so expensive, they moved to the East Coast, now they're moving back to Colorado.

641
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:44,960
And yeah, New Yorkers, no, it's 700 square feet, not 1700 700.

642
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:46,440
I can actually probably pull it up.

643
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:47,800
I can probably pull up the floor plan.

644
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:50,360
It's probably like 752 square feet.

645
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:57,000
From Ohio, whole front yard, half garage for that.

646
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,400
See, that sounds delightful.

647
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:02,480
Texas, no, I couldn't move to Texas.

648
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:10,480
Because I like, I like seasons, 57 for sheep, literally, though.

649
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:15,480
Yeah, New York, I could not live in New York.

650
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:16,480
I have friends from New York.

651
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:19,480
No, thank you.

652
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:20,480
No, thanks.

653
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:23,480
New York's too big.

654
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:25,480
I'm not really a city gal.

655
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,480
New York, New York City.

656
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:36,480
Yeah, somebody clocked my accent.

657
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:42,480
So I just, I don't, it's hard for me to deny that I'm from New England when I talk like this.

658
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,480
And I talk really fucking fast.

659
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:45,480
Comedy joysy.

660
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:47,480
Oh, I fit in just fine and jazzy.

661
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:49,480
Real fine and jazzy.

662
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:54,480
I'm just going to move into Vermont.

663
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:58,480
New York is so ghetto right now.

664
01:04:58,480 --> 01:04:59,480
Yeah.

665
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:00,480
Hey, let's do this.

666
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:05,480
Where is black myth?

667
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:06,480
Who called?

668
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:09,480
Woot.

669
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:11,480
I'm going to say black myth Wu Tang.

670
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:14,480
And it's just, that'd be a funny edit.

671
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:23,480
Why isn't it capturing the game?

672
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:25,480
Oh.

673
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:30,480
Why is it just called B1?

674
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:34,480
That's why, because I'm like, I don't see black myth Wu Kong in the game capture list.

675
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:38,480
Does that sound good?

676
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:47,480
Black myth Wu Tang ain't no fuck with.

677
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:50,480
What?

678
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:55,480
Excuse me.

679
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:56,480
Yeah, yeah, I know.

680
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:58,480
I was, I'm turning off my BGM.

681
01:05:58,480 --> 01:05:59,480
Thank you.

682
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:05,480
Wait, that's not how that song goes.

683
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:07,480
You okay?

684
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:09,480
Hold on.

685
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:10,480
Let me move myself to the Swide.

686
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:14,480
I need to, I forget I need to do toggles to like kind of move me to the side.

687
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:17,480
Wait, what?

688
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:22,480
Did I mess up my capture?

689
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:26,480
Oh, I'm like all the way over here for some reason.

690
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:31,480
Hello.

691
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:35,480
I just like talking to you guys.

692
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:38,480
I make a better door than a window.

693
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:42,480
Rule 34 of Wu Tang.

694
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:44,480
Grossies are expensive.

695
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:46,480
I, I don't know.

696
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:47,480
I don't know.

697
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:48,480
I don't know.

698
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:49,480
I don't know.

699
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:50,480
Wu Tang.

700
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:51,480
Grossies are expensive.

701
01:06:51,480 --> 01:07:00,480
I think I'm going to bite the bullet and get start getting blue apron or hello fresh

702
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:07,480
again because that I can do like the two person meal thing and three meals and then I'm good

703
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:10,480
for the week and it's what like a hundred and something dollars.

704
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:13,480
I was going to do a hello.

705
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:16,480
I was going to try to do a hello fresh sponsor.

706
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:22,480
But then one of my mutuals explained to me like a lot of shit that happened with them.

707
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:28,480
So for like overseas people, like a hello fresh overseas is not good.

708
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:35,480
USA is fine, but overseas is not the best Costco.

709
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:36,480
Yeah.

710
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:37,480
We're Costco guys.

711
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:41,480
I don't even have a Costco's near me.

712
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:45,480
I think I like beaches.

713
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:46,480
Get it.

714
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:47,480
Hello fresh is not.

715
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:53,480
I literally kept hello fresh recipes because I liked them so much and I've still done them.

716
01:07:53,480 --> 01:08:00,480
Like, oh, one of my favorite hello fresh recipes was a biscuit topped chicken pot pie.

717
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:09,480
So it was like carrots, celery, chicken, you know, herbs, spices, all that little bit of potatoes.

718
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:12,480
And then you put biscuits on top of it.

719
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:22,480
What do you mean they don't do that?

720
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:24,480
They're crazy with free samples.

721
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:25,480
I remember.

722
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:27,480
Yeah, we get like a little cheesecake.

723
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:29,480
Eat those fucking cheesecakes like nobody's business.

724
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:34,480
How are you doing for you?

725
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:36,480
You girl.

726
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:38,480
Oh.

727
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:39,480
You just sneeze.

728
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:47,480
You all right?

729
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:48,480
Hold on.

730
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:50,480
I'm going to see if I can get Fia some water before I get started.

731
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:53,480
Because when I tried feeding her before, she didn't want to drink water.

732
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:57,480
And then I then she went to the bathroom, but then she didn't want to drink water afterwards.

733
01:08:57,480 --> 01:09:01,480
I don't want my baby girl to be dehydrated.

734
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:11,480
Hello, ma'am.

735
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:14,480
Would you like some wawa?

736
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:17,480
You licking your lips.

737
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:19,480
Oops, I'm still in water on the floor.

738
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:22,480
When you want some?

739
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:23,480
Oh, yeah, you do.

740
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:25,480
See, I knew you were thirsty.

741
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:27,480
I knew you were thirsty, bitch.

742
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:32,480
Ugh, bro.

743
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:37,480
Have I told you guys my tits get in the way of everything?

744
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:40,480
It's hard to bend over because my boobs are in the way.

745
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:48,480
I'm squatting down and I literally have to like spread my legs so my boobs can hang in between.

746
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:51,480
I can't just like crouch normally.

747
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:54,480
I have to stand like fucking Spider-Man.

748
01:09:55,480 --> 01:10:00,480
I have to squat like Spider-Man about to leap off a building so my boobs can hang between.

749
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:05,480
I'm tired of this.

750
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:10,480
How are you going to help with that?

751
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:13,480
Suffering from success.

752
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:16,480
It has nothing to do with holding with them.

753
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:17,480
They just get in the way.

754
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:27,480
That's why I sleep with my arms up because I can't like sleep with my arms like folded across my chest or like laying down my side.

755
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:36,480
She thirsty.

756
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:41,480
This is hurting my back.

757
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:45,480
There's no weight.

758
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:46,480
It's not the weight.

759
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:48,480
It's literally, they're just in the way.

760
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:56,480
I can't wait to chop these puppies off.

761
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:58,480
He's kidding.

762
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:11,480
He's still drinking.

763
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:16,480
Isn't, well yeah, the back pain is due to the weight, yeah.

764
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:19,480
My shoulder pain.

765
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:20,480
My shoulder pain.

766
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:27,480
In my arthritis.

767
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:31,480
Children down the spine of harlots everywhere.

768
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:47,480
You guys act like, it's every time I like mention getting a reduction.

769
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:51,480
People think I'm literally getting top surgery and just cutting them off.

770
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:57,480
I'm like, oh, I want a reduction maybe to like, because I'm bigger.

771
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:59,480
I'm what, like a F?

772
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:00,480
Yeah, I think I'm F.

773
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:06,480
And I want to go to like a C and people are like, no.

774
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:10,480
A C, that's practically nothing.

775
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:15,480
When C's are like pretty normal size.

776
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:18,480
Oh, I literally booked, hold on.

777
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:20,480
I'm going to retweet it right fucking now.

778
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:29,480
I read, there was this, I like, there was this fucking tweet in my bookmarks of this girl.

779
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:32,480
I was just laughing at the comments.

780
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:35,480
I'm going to find it.

781
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:38,480
I'm going to retweet it right now.

782
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:39,480
It's going to be on my all.

783
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:40,480
She'd be in a stuff FW.

784
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:42,480
And um,

785
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:50,480
this girl gets a reduction and she still has boom.

786
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:57,480
And I could see the relief in her body and she looked a lot smaller too.

787
01:12:57,480 --> 01:13:00,480
Cause again, when you have large breasts, they make you look a little bit fatter

788
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:05,480
because they take away from your waist and I'm going to find it.

789
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:06,480
I'm going to find it.

790
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:10,480
I just want you to look at the comments and know that's how I see y'all.

791
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:16,480
I might have to scroll way, way back.

792
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:19,480
Cause I bookmark.

793
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:21,480
Oh, I'm going to, I'm going to retweet this too.

794
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:22,480
Let me retweet this one.

795
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:24,480
That seems appropriate.

796
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:28,480
Oh, there it is.

797
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:32,480
I'm not going to lie.

798
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:35,480
I'm literally built like her.

799
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:39,480
I'm literally built like this girl that I just retweeted.

800
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:50,480
And I'm like, what I would give.

801
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:55,480
Oh, what I would give for the second picture, man.

802
01:13:57,480 --> 01:13:58,480
Oh my God.

803
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:00,480
A fitting top.

804
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:01,480
Oh.

805
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:09,480
You know how much shit I got to send back because it doesn't fit my fucking boobs.

806
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:15,480
Yeah, literally her smile.

807
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:16,480
She's geeking.

808
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:24,480
Oh, I haven't looked at the comments in a while.

809
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:29,480
Oh, there is like some people.

810
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:32,480
Who just like really went off.

811
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:35,480
I think all those comments are gone now for some reason.

812
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:40,480
Or there was like someone highlighting some of the bad comments and that was deleted, I guess.

813
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:43,480
Cause I was like, I remember that specifically being the top comment.

814
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:46,480
Donate whatever move to scrawny.

815
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:48,480
No, it's going straight to my ass, motherfucker.

816
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:55,480
Yeah, both are hot.

817
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:56,480
Trust me.

818
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:59,480
I fucking love my tits so much.

819
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:06,480
Minus the arthritis in my neck, the permanent bruising on my shoulders, the constant back pain.

820
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:15,480
My arms falling asleep when I go to bed because my boobs fucking pin the my inner arm and make them go numb and I can't move my arms.

821
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:27,480
I like being able to wear like certain like outfits because I have big boobs, but a lot of clothes don't fit me.

822
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:34,480
And I usually have to shop in the plus side section when I'm not plus size and that fucks with my head a lot.

823
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:39,480
I'm going to un-retweet that.

824
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:46,480
And like, trust me, like I've gone through the motion.

825
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:49,480
I lost, I lost cause I thought I could do it with weight.

826
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:54,480
I lost 50 fucking pounds because I had gained weight during COVID.

827
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:57,480
And my boobs size didn't change.

828
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:08,480
I was, yeah, I was, I was like a double D and then I gained weight and I dropped it back and now I'm a G F whatever the fuck.

829
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:09,480
I don't know.

830
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:14,480
And every shirt becomes a crop top for me.

831
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:15,480
You see my model.

832
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:17,480
That's literally, they're bigger than that.

833
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:21,480
Oh, excuse me.

834
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:28,480
People are going to be like, why the fuck is this on my feed?

835
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:36,480
And like, I did physical therapy and everything.

836
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:44,480
I've done, I've done a lot of things to like strengthen my back, my shoulders, do all that stuff.

837
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:47,480
Cause I don't, cause I have a thing with scarring.

838
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:50,480
The model's in their version.

839
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:51,480
I have a thing with scarring.

840
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:54,480
I scar really fucking badly.

841
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:57,480
I bump into something.

842
01:16:57,480 --> 01:16:58,480
It's a scar.

843
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:00,480
A bruise for me becomes a scar.

844
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:07,480
Boomi jumped on my lap and the kind of mist and accidentally scratched me.

845
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:09,480
It or it's scarred.

846
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:10,480
Like it sucks.

847
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:18,480
And so I, I didn't want to get one because I was afraid of how I would scar.

848
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:20,480
But now I just don't give a shit.

849
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:24,480
Nobody's looking at my boobies besides me.

850
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:30,480
If I ever flash my boobies on the internet, I hope you guys would love them anyways.

851
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:35,480
They'll be like, no, we want to see that's I'm kidding.

852
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:36,480
That's never happening.

853
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:37,480
You're never seeing my tits, bro.

854
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:38,480
I'm so sorry.

855
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:39,480
You can just unsubscribe now.

856
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:41,480
I'm a fucking Vtuber.

857
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:45,480
If you want to, if you want to, if you want to porn star, go to fucking Twitch.

858
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:49,480
Oh, I'm kidding.

859
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:50,480
I love those bitches.

860
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:51,480
Get that back sis.

861
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:53,480
Swimming pools.

862
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:54,480
Yeah, sure.

863
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:58,480
No, just go to, just go to fucking Chatterbait.

864
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:01,480
Yeah.

865
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:07,480
This is, this is, see my big mouth gets me in trouble.

866
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:12,480
Someone's going to clip that, take out a contact and be like, she fucking hates Twitch.

867
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:13,480
No, no.

868
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:19,480
All right.

869
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:20,480
Should we play the game?

870
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:24,480
I'm just, I'm kind of stalling.

871
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:25,480
Am I stalling?

872
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:27,480
The hub is free.

873
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:30,480
Just find a girl.

874
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:33,480
Just look up, just look up light skin ebony with curly hair.

875
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:34,480
Boom.

876
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:35,480
Just think that's me.

877
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:36,480
Just picture that as me.

878
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:39,480
That's what I do when I self-insert.

879
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:43,480
I'm just like black ebony girl.

880
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:50,480
I will, you know what?

881
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:51,480
You know what?

882
01:18:51,480 --> 01:19:00,480
For a donathon reward, I'll drop, I'll drop the porn star that I've been compared to.

883
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:03,480
IRL.

884
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:06,480
And you won't be disappointed.

885
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:07,480
She's very popular.

886
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:11,480
I'll drop her name.

887
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:17,480
Stretch goal.

888
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:21,480
The porn star that looks like she be IRL.

889
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:30,480
Oh, you got to guess to guess.

890
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:32,480
It's not Kira Noir.

891
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:33,480
I wish it was.

892
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:34,480
She's so fucking hot.

893
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:36,480
Fuck, I love Kira Noir.

894
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:39,480
I watch a lot of her shit.

895
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:41,480
Guys, I'm a coomer.

896
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:42,480
I'm a coomer.

897
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:43,480
You guys know this.

898
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:46,480
Oh, wait, hold on.

899
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:47,480
Who's the other chick?

900
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:49,480
Is it, what's her name?

901
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:53,480
I was about to go in private mode.

902
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:55,480
I'm like, nobody else is on my fucking computer.

903
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:59,480
Is that Cecilia Fox or whatever the fuck her name is?

904
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:02,480
Porn star.

905
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:07,480
I'm 18 years old.

906
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:08,480
Cecilia Lyon?

907
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:11,480
Baddie.

908
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:15,480
She is like similar hair to me.

909
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:17,480
Oh, my hair's a little bit.

910
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:23,480
I'm trying to look like Cecilia Lyon for real, for real, though.

911
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:29,480
I don't want to make my titties that small, but she's hot as fuck too.

912
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:30,480
Sorry.

913
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:34,480
I'm sorry.

914
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:35,480
I'm getting distracted.

915
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:37,480
Shout out to my baby girl, Kira.

916
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:42,480
Kira Perez, let me see.

917
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:52,480
Nah, she's like Spanish.

918
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:56,480
She looks like fucking Caliuchi.

919
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:57,480
What the hell?

920
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:02,480
She looks like Caliuchi's.

921
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:03,480
What?

922
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:08,480
Nah, I look nothing like her.

923
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:12,480
I'm a little darker than her.

924
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:14,480
She hot as fuck though.

925
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:15,480
I'm gonna have to watch her shit.

926
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:23,480
Mariah Millet?

927
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:24,480
Hold on.

928
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:25,480
I'm looking at you.

929
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:26,480
I'm looking at you.

930
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:34,480
Images.

931
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:36,480
Bruh, nah.

932
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:40,480
Damn, she thick as fuck.

933
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:43,480
Holy shit.

934
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:47,480
No, I don't look like that.

935
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:53,480
Oh, my God.

936
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:54,480
Doesn't she?

937
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:56,480
Doesn't she look like Caliuchi's?

938
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:00,480
She thick as fuck.

939
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:03,480
Why are you getting fight or flight?

940
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:06,480
Should I get tier?

941
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:08,480
Oh, that's a good idea, actually.

942
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:10,480
Am I allowed to do that though?

943
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:11,480
I don't know if I would be.

944
01:22:11,480 --> 01:22:13,480
I wonder if there's a copyright for that.

945
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:14,480
Oh, my God.

946
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:16,480
Tier list of like porn stars.

947
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:19,480
I like Kira Noir S.

948
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:22,480
What's that girl's name?

949
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:27,480
Sweetie Fox S.

950
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:29,480
Belle Delphine A.

951
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:35,480
Cecilia Lyon A.

952
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:41,480
I get more after you guys type Cali.

953
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:48,480
Oh, Connie S.

954
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:50,480
What?

955
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:52,480
I put Belle Delphine A.

956
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:55,480
What would you put Belle Delphine S?

957
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:57,480
Mia Khalifa.

958
01:22:57,480 --> 01:23:02,480
See, I want like,

959
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:06,480
Mia Khalifa's hot and all,

960
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:09,480
but the regret she showed,

961
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:13,480
because she'd barely got paid for any of the stuff that she made.

962
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:16,480
She shot like videos and a lot of the women,

963
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:18,480
and that was like in the past and she regrets a lot of it.

964
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:20,480
So like, I remember I watched an interview about her

965
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:24,480
and how she gets no money and like all that stuff from her videos.

966
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:26,480
I just like feel bad.

967
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:30,480
So I like can't do anything with anything with her in it.

968
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:35,480
Yeah, she only made like like 10.

969
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:38,480
Yeah, she only made like 10 K when she should be like a millionaire.

970
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:43,480
Eva Adams.

971
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:45,480
Let's look at it.

972
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:54,480
Oh, yeah, I watched stuff of her in it.

973
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:56,480
Like milk stuff.

974
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:02,480
What size are her boobs?

975
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:06,480
God damn.

976
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:12,480
Did she get a mojo?

977
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:14,480
Because like in one photo, she looks smaller.

978
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:16,480
So she must have gotten a bigger,

979
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:18,480
which I don't know why people would do that.

980
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:24,480
She got a butter face though.

981
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:27,480
I'm fucked.

982
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:29,480
I'm fucked in the head.

983
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:30,480
Oh my God.

984
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:33,480
Sherry DeVille.

985
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:43,480
Oh, yeah, I've seen stuff with her in it.

986
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:47,480
I just don't like, I've always, I've never liked her face.

987
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:49,480
She just looks so whiny.

988
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:54,480
She has a nice, she's, she's nice to look at though.

989
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:55,480
Otherwise.

990
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:03,480
What do you look for?

991
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:06,480
Sasha Grey's nice.

992
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:08,480
Yeah, Sasha Grey's a good one.

993
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:13,480
Got too many tattoos.

994
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:14,480
I like tattoos.

995
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:16,480
If tattoos are on the girl or the guy, I don't care.

996
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:19,480
Because I think, I think tattoos are hot and the right person.

997
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:22,480
The overdramatic moments.

998
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:24,480
Sometimes I'll literally just watch stuff on mute.

999
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:30,480
Carmine Rose.

1000
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:40,480
Ooh, she's pretty.

1001
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:46,480
I'm getting a lot of pictures of flowers.

1002
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:48,480
Yeah.

1003
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:50,480
Yeah.

1004
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:53,480
I think my mom has this flower in her garden, which is funny.

1005
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:56,480
Riley Reed.

1006
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:57,480
You know.

1007
01:25:57,480 --> 01:25:58,480
Yeah.

1008
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:00,480
She's, she's Riley, Riley Reed just seems messy.

1009
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:02,480
Lena Plunk.

1010
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:03,480
Yeah.

1011
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:05,480
Tattoos that have flavor.

1012
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:12,480
So I like, you know, like small hands and what Owen Gray, like they're, they're fine for me.

1013
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:17,480
One of my, one of my top favorite flucking videos is, is it, oh, is his name?

1014
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:18,480
Owen Gray.

1015
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:29,480
I don't know.

1016
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:33,480
Is with him and Kira Noir.

1017
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:34,480
Yeah.

1018
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:42,480
Yeah.

1019
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:48,480
Like Johnny sins is okay.

1020
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:51,480
I don't know who Jack Knife or Luke Longling are.

1021
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:54,480
Those are fucking funny names, Jack Knife.

1022
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:07,480
He looks like a typical white boy.

1023
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:20,480
He's, he, he looks like he should be in a background of like a Jack Harlow music video.

1024
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:22,480
Jordy El Nino point.

1025
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:24,480
No, I don't like him.

1026
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:26,480
I don't like him.

1027
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:30,480
He's just so fucking, he acts so weird and stuff, bro.

1028
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:37,480
I like Owen Gray because he's very sensual with the girls that he's with.

1029
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:41,480
And I'm pretty sure like, you know, Kira Noir, Kira Noir is gay.

1030
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:42,480
She likes girls.

1031
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:47,480
I think she said in an interview that the only dude that had ever actually made her like,

1032
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,480
what was Owen Gray?

1033
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:55,480
I hate, I'm sorry.

1034
01:27:55,480 --> 01:27:57,480
I hate Jordy.

1035
01:27:58,480 --> 01:27:59,480
Johnny sins.

1036
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:00,480
Johnny sins.

1037
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:03,480
Johnny sins is a, is a legends.

1038
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:04,480
So,

1039
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:08,480
Luke Longling.

1040
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:10,480
I don't know who these people are.

1041
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:12,480
Ew.

1042
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:21,480
The thing is like male porn stars are already always fucking ugly.

1043
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:24,480
That's why I usually just watch stuff with girls in it.

1044
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:27,480
Or like POV shit.

1045
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:30,480
I'm just like, cause I like the dude's looks so fucking ugly.

1046
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:35,480
Yeah.

1047
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:38,480
Yeah.

1048
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:40,480
He's, he's ascended past that he's just a meme.

1049
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:49,480
Sweetie Fox is just, she's so hot.

1050
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:53,480
Like, she's just fucking gorgeous.

1051
01:28:53,480 --> 01:29:00,480
Or like, I just like some, like, I, I watched some stuff just because the person is just

1052
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:02,480
like, be artistically beautiful.

1053
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:06,480
Their body is just artistically beautiful to me and she's one of those people.

1054
01:29:07,480 --> 01:29:09,480
She has a, she just has a nice face.

1055
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:10,480
She's a nice body.

1056
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:13,480
Bell bells.

1057
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:14,480
I don't know who that is.

1058
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:26,480
I can't like listen to like, it's funny cause like I make audios.

1059
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:35,480
I'm, I'm going to tell you guys something funny after this.

1060
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:40,480
I make audios for people, but I can't listen to audios by guys.

1061
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:48,480
It makes me cringe so hard, like really bad, whether it be, and it, and it's funny.

1062
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:54,480
It's only the hardest ones that make me cringe, whether it be like the guy is sub or the guy is dumb.

1063
01:29:55,480 --> 01:29:58,480
The guide being dumb makes me cringe so fucking hard.

1064
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:06,480
And I just like, then the sub dude just sounds really fucking whining to me, so I can't listen to this.

1065
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:19,480
However, and she knows this already, by the way, so you don't have to go running over to

1066
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:21,480
Ronnie and telling her this.

1067
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:37,480
But I have consumed before she was a vtuber.

1068
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:44,480
Some of specific audios.

1069
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:49,480
Why am I wheezing?

1070
01:30:49,480 --> 01:30:53,480
Sometimes I don't, when I laugh lately, I like wheeze, like there's something in my throat.

1071
01:30:53,480 --> 01:30:56,480
Am I, do I have a fucking upper respiratory issue?

1072
01:30:56,480 --> 01:30:58,480
I laugh like a smoker lately.

1073
01:30:58,480 --> 01:30:59,480
What the fuck?

1074
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:11,480
But yeah, now you guys know she already knows that.

1075
01:31:15,480 --> 01:31:18,480
I never wheeze while laughing though, so.

1076
01:31:23,480 --> 01:31:32,480
Because girl, like, like, you guys know, most corn is not made for women.

1077
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:35,480
It's made for men's consumption.

1078
01:31:35,480 --> 01:31:46,480
So I will usually watch stuff made by women, because women know what other women like.

1079
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:51,480
And she, yeah, which is weird and funny.

1080
01:31:51,480 --> 01:32:00,480
It's very, very, if you told me a couple years ago, I would be kind of disturbed.

1081
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:06,480
But, but yeah.

1082
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:11,480
Yeah, and I'm falling asleep to a lot of her audios too.

1083
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:13,480
Just starting to make some good stuff.

1084
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:16,480
I wasn't doing my research.

1085
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:18,480
I didn't know she existed yet.

1086
01:32:19,480 --> 01:32:22,480
Whether it be male or female VAs, I can't listen to audios in one sitting.

1087
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:23,480
I have to listen to intervals.

1088
01:32:23,480 --> 01:32:24,480
Interesting.

1089
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:29,480
It's been an hour and a half and I haven't started the game.

1090
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:33,480
Even her be practically joined at the hip, essentially, yeah.

1091
01:32:35,480 --> 01:32:37,480
She was just like, oh, stop it.

1092
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:40,480
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1093
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:47,480
Oh, and because I've also, like, consumed flesh.

1094
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:49,480
Posting.

1095
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:55,480
Which was.

1096
01:32:56,480 --> 01:33:02,480
Also a little bit weird because she's my boss.

1097
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:20,480
And she was just like Mary, like she didn't.

1098
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:24,480
She just thought it was hilarious and just laughed at me and, you know,

1099
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:26,480
sent a little blush emoji.

1100
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:28,480
It was like, I'm happy you.

1101
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:29,480
I'm happy.

1102
01:33:29,480 --> 01:33:31,480
I can't even do a fucking accent right now.

1103
01:33:31,480 --> 01:33:32,480
I'm blushing right myself right now.

1104
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:47,480
I am the age.

1105
01:33:47,480 --> 01:33:49,480
I, I'm an, I'm HR.

1106
01:33:49,480 --> 01:33:50,480
Oh, Vila.

1107
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:51,480
It's me.

1108
01:33:51,480 --> 01:33:52,480
Just kidding.

1109
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:53,480
No.

1110
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:58,480
I did see it before she saved me.

1111
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:09,480
For when, when her 20 K popped up on my fucking time line.

1112
01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:12,480
I was like, this looks familiar.

1113
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:24,480
I've seen this somewhere before a sense of familiarity with this.

1114
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:25,480
Oh, wait.

1115
01:34:25,480 --> 01:34:26,480
Oh.

1116
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:38,480
And I was like, damn, she actually posted that.

1117
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:39,480
Holy crap.

1118
01:34:39,480 --> 01:34:41,480
And then I said, I would do it for 20 K.

1119
01:34:41,480 --> 01:34:44,480
So I, you know, got myself in a bit of a pickle there.

1120
01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:46,480
Did I not?

1121
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:47,480
Well, no, I knew.

1122
01:34:47,480 --> 01:34:48,480
I knew.

1123
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:50,480
I just did it when I wasn't looking at Nate.

1124
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:54,480
Like I don't really pay attention to the person's name when I'm scrolling down my,

1125
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:56,480
my alt Twitter.

1126
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:57,480
I'm busy gooning.

1127
01:34:57,480 --> 01:34:58,480
Okay.

1128
01:34:59,480 --> 01:35:00,480
I do not goon.

1129
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:01,480
I'm massive.

1130
01:35:01,480 --> 01:35:06,480
I have to, I have to do that fucking, uh, like copy pasta at some point.

1131
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:08,480
I'll have to read that out loud.

1132
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:09,480
Um.

1133
01:35:09,480 --> 01:35:10,480
Um.

1134
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:15,480
Yeah.

1135
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:22,480
When you're, when you're, when you grow up as a sheltered, stifled Christian girl.

1136
01:35:22,480 --> 01:35:24,480
Only child.

1137
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:27,480
Not that having siblings with anyways.

1138
01:35:27,480 --> 01:35:33,480
Um, and, uh, you're alone all the time.

1139
01:35:33,480 --> 01:35:38,480
And you can't really do anything because everything is bad.

1140
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:42,480
Cause you're a very good Christian girl.

1141
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:50,480
So you, you, you DJ and secret, you know, any moment.

1142
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:52,480
This is a little lower fit was cat.

1143
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:54,480
No, it was accurate.

1144
01:35:54,480 --> 01:36:00,480
Um, the repressionist consequences.

1145
01:36:01,480 --> 01:36:07,480
I remember crying, praying to God.

1146
01:36:07,480 --> 01:36:14,480
That when the world, when, if the world ever came to the end to please spare me.

1147
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:17,480
I'm so sorry.

1148
01:36:17,480 --> 01:36:23,480
I cracked open the nut so many times.

1149
01:36:23,480 --> 01:36:26,480
God, please forgive me of my sins.

1150
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:31,480
That's so sad.

1151
01:36:31,480 --> 01:36:36,480
Quietly riding my pillow into a oblivion.

1152
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:38,480
Did you think the world would end in 2012?

1153
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:39,480
No.

1154
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:47,480
English, English.

1155
01:36:47,480 --> 01:36:50,480
I guess we should play the game, right?

1156
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:55,480
Oh, I keep my game of fucking up.

1157
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:02,480
Now I dress as a nun.

1158
01:37:02,480 --> 01:37:06,480
Unfortunately, there are people out there who feel the need to abuse others in the name of religions.

1159
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:08,480
Yeah, exactly.

1160
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:10,480
I wasn't abused.

1161
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:12,480
At least not a lot.

1162
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:16,480
Let's, let's, you know, please read the entire document.

1163
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:19,480
All right.

1164
01:37:19,480 --> 01:37:20,480
Okay.

1165
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:22,480
That doesn't edit.

1166
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:32,480
I did get someone did try to groom me, but I was, I was a smart person because I had now had been on the internet for long enough.

1167
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:36,480
I do read fast.

1168
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:40,480
Now I get to groom you guys.

1169
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:43,480
Nope.

1170
01:37:43,480 --> 01:37:45,480
Raina.

1171
01:37:45,480 --> 01:37:49,480
Are you screaming in the bathroom?

1172
01:37:49,480 --> 01:37:52,480
Why is it just a crack?

1173
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:55,480
It's a weird save icon.

1174
01:38:11,480 --> 01:38:14,480
Yeah, but that was different.

1175
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:26,480
It's different when you think it's like a cool older boy over the internet versus like an old creepy man who says I really see you as like one of my daughters.

1176
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:36,480
That's terrible.

1177
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:37,480
Yo, come on.

1178
01:38:37,480 --> 01:38:40,480
It happens to the best of us.

1179
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:42,480
Haven't you had a little groomage?

1180
01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:44,480
Come on.

1181
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:45,480
Don't worry guys.

1182
01:38:45,480 --> 01:38:46,480
I went to therapy for that.

1183
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:50,480
It's fine.

1184
01:38:50,480 --> 01:39:02,480
Guys, guys, guys, I'm trying to, I'm trying to laugh at it and you guys are pitying me and that's not what I want.

1185
01:39:02,480 --> 01:39:05,480
I'm your first groomer.

1186
01:39:05,480 --> 01:39:06,480
You're too basic a groom.

1187
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:07,480
That means you were ugly.

1188
01:39:07,480 --> 01:39:08,480
No kidding.

1189
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:09,480
I'm kidding.

1190
01:39:09,480 --> 01:39:10,480
I'm kidding.

1191
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:11,480
I'm kidding.

1192
01:39:11,480 --> 01:39:12,480
I'm kidding.

1193
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:13,480
I'm kidding.

1194
01:39:13,480 --> 01:39:14,480
I'm kidding.

1195
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:17,480
I'm kidding.

1196
01:39:17,480 --> 01:39:22,480
See, I should be a stand-up comedian.

1197
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:25,480
The screen is black.

1198
01:39:25,480 --> 01:39:28,480
I could do amazing crowd work.

1199
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:32,480
Call me Matt Reif.

1200
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:36,480
I'll just be a ms Andrews instead.

1201
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:40,480
I need to shut the fuck up.

1202
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:42,960

1203
01:39:45,240 --> 01:39:48,200
Comedian you just murder there it is

1204

So men and then the crowd just laughs and I just end the set in this walk-off stage

1205
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:08,520
So how about those men, you know, if it was between a man and a bear I'd pick the bear

1206
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:12,320
Oh, everybody stands and claps and I walk off the stage

1207
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:19,120

01:43:12,120 --> 01:43:14,280
Wow, this is great. I should just mute the thing then

1236
01:43:16,360 --> 01:43:18,360
That's me in the background screaming

01:43:21,400 --> 01:43:25,480
Do I fight the guy from sucker punch just kidding that's a samurai

1238
01:43:32,360 --> 01:43:34,360
The sound isn't matching up

1239
01:43:41,160 --> 01:43:52,200
It's gotta be obs no it's for me too

1240
01:44:11,400 --> 01:44:13,400

It's a big ass dude those high above don't trust me I understand that

1242
01:44:30,200 --> 01:44:38,760
And they send you in those knuckleheads to threaten me to obey and the mouth tracking is not there

1243
01:44:39,640 --> 01:44:41,640
I understand that too

1244
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:45,560
But what I don't understand

1245
01:44:47,720 --> 01:44:49,720
You

1246
01:44:54,840 --> 01:44:57,240

01:45:00,520 --> 01:45:02,520
I want the puppy

1248
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:13,480
I don't know Chinese mythology enough to know what this thing is

1249
01:45:17,080 --> 01:45:21,320
But it's pretty sick looking yeah, it was a set of my sins noise

1250
01:45:27,960 --> 01:45:32,840
Stay back stupid you make me look bad sorry

01:45:32,840 --> 01:45:39,560
He's not just any monkey

1252
01:45:41,080 --> 01:45:45,880
He's a monkey of merit a monkey was made Buddha once

1253
01:45:48,840 --> 01:45:53,880
No, nothing me can challenge him to a duel the dogs like but I want to fight

1254
01:45:55,800 --> 01:45:57,800
Look monkey

1255
01:45:57,800 --> 01:46:01,640
I don't make a habit of fighting someone. I've bested before

1256
01:46:01,720 --> 01:46:06,840
It's a sound bite. It can't be yes. I fucking know that. It's just funny to see it in fucking black myth wukong

1257
01:46:11,960 --> 01:46:17,160
You just say wukong is one of the good monkey, but if I like his little headdress

1258
01:46:17,480 --> 01:46:22,680
Certainly take revenge and they will level your mountain nonetheless

1259
01:46:27,960 --> 01:46:34,360
How tragic would that be you are one of the court we don't need to resort to violence

1260
01:46:36,680 --> 01:46:39,000
How about you bend the knees

1261
01:46:39,800 --> 01:46:41,800
Admit the wrongs

1262
01:46:41,880 --> 01:46:44,120
And we can put this behind us

1263
01:46:44,600 --> 01:46:47,160
What wrongs hold on I'm gonna get rid of my model

1264
01:46:51,640 --> 01:46:53,640
All these years

1265
01:46:54,600 --> 01:47:02,040
Except for that pig you're the one who talks the tallest tales. Good. I am entertained

1266
01:47:02,840 --> 01:47:05,800
I kind of wish I put this in Chinese because I feel like the Chinese dub is better

1267
01:47:06,440 --> 01:47:09,000
Wouldn't it be fun if I pull on I'm coming back

1270
01:47:21,320 --> 01:47:26,520
Those below those above and that black mutt of yours

01:54:22,840 --> 01:54:25,720
Do it when I do a successful dodge do I get to do that?

1333
01:54:27,800 --> 01:54:29,800
Kind of right

1334
01:54:30,600 --> 01:54:32,600
Oh

1335
01:54:38,280 --> 01:54:40,280
Hello

1336
01:54:41,240 --> 01:54:45,640
I I can't really see what's happening. I'm close to death though. Which is neat

1337
01:54:46,920 --> 01:54:48,920
Oh

1338
01:54:52,040 --> 01:54:54,040
I kind of dodged into that

1339
01:54:54,040 --> 01:54:58,920
That's really cool. I'm like honestly just mystified by this and I can't really do anything

1340
01:54:59,640 --> 01:55:01,640
I'm fighting mesmer

1341
01:55:12,040 --> 01:55:15,160
I don't know what I'm literally just spamming. I have no idea what I'm doing

1342
01:55:17,160 --> 01:55:19,160
I

1343
01:55:23,320 --> 01:55:25,320
What does this do?

1344
01:55:39,080 --> 01:55:41,080
Did he get me he got me

1345
01:55:47,240 --> 01:55:49,240
Oh

1346
01:56:00,120 --> 01:56:02,760
There's a lot of I can't keep track of what's happening

1347
01:56:05,320 --> 01:56:11,240
This is so fucking cool. What? Okay, maybe I will tell my daddy get black

1348
01:56:17,240 --> 01:56:19,240
Oh

1349
01:56:28,760 --> 01:56:34,200
What's happening are they sealing me? Oh goodbye sound

1350
01:56:37,640 --> 01:56:41,800
I'm being sealed away. Where did you get an axe?

1351
01:56:47,400 --> 01:56:49,400
I don't want to taste your ass

1352
01:56:54,120 --> 01:56:57,960
Oh, shit, you just cut a mountain in half

1353
01:57:00,120 --> 01:57:02,120
Oh

1354
01:57:12,520 --> 01:57:14,520
Why does the game keep doing that

1355
01:57:16,760 --> 01:57:18,760
Oh, he turned into a orb

1356
01:57:21,240 --> 01:57:25,080
He is flapping his darnedist. Oh, I I also turned into a bird

1357
01:57:26,280 --> 01:57:27,560
Why?

1358
01:57:27,560 --> 01:57:29,560
Why can the monkey turn into a bird?

1359
01:57:31,080 --> 01:57:34,360
Am I gonna fight as a bird now? What's happening?

1360
01:57:42,600 --> 01:57:44,600
Hello

1361
01:57:46,920 --> 01:57:48,920
Oh

1362
01:57:55,720 --> 01:57:57,960
Man, I wish I had a computer to run this properly

1363
01:58:01,880 --> 01:58:03,880
Bird myth

1364
01:58:05,880 --> 01:58:08,920
More reason oh cool

1365
01:58:09,160 --> 01:58:11,160
I

1366
01:58:14,840 --> 01:58:17,320
Like how he's like it's too bright up here. Let's go fight in the forest

1367
01:58:25,640 --> 01:58:27,640
Why is that tree shaking

1368
01:58:28,600 --> 01:58:33,160
What is going on with that tree? Is that tree supposed to be shaking?

1369
01:58:37,560 --> 01:58:39,560
Now this is dragon ball

1370
01:58:51,640 --> 01:58:53,640
Ah turned into a rock

1371
01:58:58,040 --> 01:59:04,920
How warm is my PC? Oh she toasties

1372
01:59:12,200 --> 01:59:14,200
Oh damn

1373
01:59:25,160 --> 01:59:27,320
That voice sounds familiar task manager

1374
01:59:27,320 --> 01:59:29,320
Okay, I thought so

1375
01:59:41,400 --> 01:59:46,840
Oh 97 87% separately they escaped choosing to stay in

1376
01:59:48,600 --> 01:59:51,720
76 CPU usage very nice

1377
01:59:58,280 --> 02:00:05,560
Yet no one has ever seen them nothing centuries. I don't want to see where the heat is

1378
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
I'm old now

1379
02:00:09,560 --> 02:00:11,560
Venture through all the lands

1380
02:00:12,120 --> 02:00:19,240
65% CPU 53 memory 5% disk 2% network 71% GPU among you

1381
02:00:20,360 --> 02:00:23,080
There might be one who is destined

1382
02:00:23,880 --> 02:00:30,680
One that she'll recover or I might not be able to play this game again until I get a new PC

1383
02:00:33,880 --> 02:00:40,360
It's 76 degrees the seat the GPU right now. It's warmer than my house

1384
02:00:44,440 --> 02:00:47,880
Wait no, it says 76 degrees Celsius that cannot be right

1385
02:00:53,080 --> 02:00:55,080
It does sound like David Attenborough

1386
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:03,240
Is it David Attenborough? It's 76C. What does that mean?

1387
02:01:13,400 --> 02:01:16,920
I can't oh I'm frozen

1388
02:01:17,240 --> 02:01:19,240
Oh

1389
02:01:34,920 --> 02:01:38,360
Mikey I can't untab from steam

1390
02:01:42,440 --> 02:01:44,440
It's not letting me

1391
02:01:46,920 --> 02:01:48,920
I

1392
02:01:59,320 --> 02:02:02,040
Why is it I've like noticed a trend

1393
02:02:04,600 --> 02:02:11,960
Why do PCs always die before a donathon? I've seen it in other companies. Is this the PC curse?

1394
02:02:11,960 --> 02:02:13,960
It's

1395
02:02:14,280 --> 02:02:21,240
Because the Zuras was acting up before her donathon too. Thankfully it was fine. It's for the game is completely frozen

1396
02:02:23,400 --> 02:02:27,400
I wanted to play this so bad

1397
02:02:27,400 --> 02:02:29,400
Oh

1398
02:02:40,760 --> 02:02:48,680
It is I I built this it is seven years old 1070 2700x AMD

1399
02:02:49,160 --> 02:02:51,160
Oh

1400
02:02:57,480 --> 02:02:59,480
Man

1401
02:03:00,200 --> 02:03:03,960
I have a 2700x AMD CPU

1402
02:03:07,640 --> 02:03:09,640
Bro come on

1403
02:03:12,280 --> 02:03:15,640
No, I'm not gonna fucking put a PC on throne

1404
02:03:16,600 --> 02:03:19,100
I'll buy that with the donathon. Okay, we're alive

1405
02:03:28,280 --> 02:03:30,280
I literally want to cry

1406
02:03:30,920 --> 02:03:32,920
Reach

1407
02:03:38,920 --> 02:03:41,240
It's a lot of animal people and furries in this game

1408
02:03:46,200 --> 02:03:48,200
He sounds exactly like soon

1409
02:03:55,480 --> 02:03:57,480
Not the sound being off

1410
02:04:00,600 --> 02:04:02,600
I'll make sure you regret this

1411
02:04:07,720 --> 02:04:10,440
I just killed these men not men

1412
02:04:22,680 --> 02:04:26,840
It wasn't a peach it was the monkey all along

1413
02:04:27,800 --> 02:04:30,200
Can you compromise? No guys

1414
02:04:34,120 --> 02:04:37,560
I don't want to do I just feel really shitty if I do that

1415
02:04:38,760 --> 02:04:43,320
I don't even know what type of build I would do. I'll definitely do a PC. Oh, oh god

1416
02:04:45,960 --> 02:04:49,000
I think I was this rb sprint that's it's not rb

1417
02:04:57,320 --> 02:04:59,320
I

1418
02:05:01,960 --> 02:05:05,240
I can feel the heat by my feet because my PC is right next to my feet

1419
02:05:06,840 --> 02:05:09,640
Why she be a muppet because she be fucking struggling

1420
02:05:11,320 --> 02:05:15,480
All over my settings to the lowest fucking shit. Oh, hello

1423
02:05:43,720 --> 02:05:48,360
Oh, bro, it looks like fucking shit

1424
02:05:48,600 --> 02:05:50,600
Oh

1425
02:05:51,880 --> 02:05:54,760
Yeah, we're literally playing a ps3 game

1426
02:06:01,320 --> 02:06:03,480
Ray Tracing could be sick or already off

1427
02:06:08,920 --> 02:06:11,480
Where do I go is this open world?

1428
02:06:12,360 --> 02:06:19,480
You just have me do a whole fucking boss battle and you want to do this all up again

1429
02:06:23,240 --> 02:06:25,240
Cold heavy attack to charge

1430
02:06:32,440 --> 02:06:34,440
Oh

1431
02:06:36,280 --> 02:06:38,280
I can't lock on

1432
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:42,520
What I'm locking on why am I running past you?

1433
02:06:48,760 --> 02:06:50,760
Okay

1434
02:06:55,720 --> 02:06:58,040

Do I have a

1436
02:07:04,040 --> 02:07:06,040
That's where I came from I think

I

1438
02:07:18,760 --> 02:07:20,760
I'm already lost

1439
02:07:25,080 --> 02:07:28,760
There's some bonds to help the stuttering it's not open world

02:07:50,200 --> 02:07:53,240
Like my monkey feet my monkey tail

1444
02:07:55,240 --> 02:07:57,960
You know it took me years to realize that

1445
02:07:58,840 --> 02:08:00,840
Um

1446
02:08:01,960 --> 02:08:06,840
What is this am I falling fucking grace it took me years to realize

1447
02:08:10,120 --> 02:08:14,840
That dragon ball was just a retelling of journey to the west

1448
02:08:17,800 --> 02:08:19,800
I never put those together

1449
02:08:20,280 --> 02:08:22,280
I

1450
02:08:25,080 --> 02:08:28,760
Nice I got real tiny piece of gold

1451
02:08:32,280 --> 02:08:34,280
He do be some goku

1452
02:08:40,440 --> 02:08:42,440
My medium is kind of the point

1453
02:08:45,080 --> 02:08:47,080
Yeah, I watch drinkable z

1454
02:08:47,800 --> 02:08:52,360
Wait, there's mimics in this game. Don't tell me that

1455
02:08:56,840 --> 02:08:58,840
Oh guys

1456
02:09:10,440 --> 02:09:15,800
I plucked my hair and it turned into fucking that the hell had my hair turned into incense

1457
02:09:18,040 --> 02:09:20,040
This is a skill tree

1458
02:09:24,920 --> 02:09:32,440
Who are you a keeper of black wind mountain have long been waiting for your arrival. You look like a potato

1459
02:09:34,120 --> 02:09:36,680
Oh, he's spitting image

1460
02:09:37,800 --> 02:09:39,800
I'd say

1461
02:09:43,560 --> 02:09:46,440
Up ahead is guanyin temple

1462
02:09:48,040 --> 02:09:50,040
It's literally roshi

1463
02:09:50,520 --> 02:09:53,320
Once it was bustling with worshipers

1464
02:09:54,360 --> 02:09:57,480
Before it was ruined by that fire

1465
02:09:59,240 --> 02:10:05,560
The beating fight is incredible too bad my pc couldn't run it correctly then the temple was rebuilt

1466
02:10:08,840 --> 02:10:10,840
So he was a perv probably

1467
02:10:10,840 --> 02:10:12,840
To rebuild a temple

1468
02:10:13,400 --> 02:10:19,480
Is guanyin? Oh, I don't know. I feel like I have I'm not super familiar with the lore

1469
02:10:20,600 --> 02:10:24,840
Of this, but I feel like I have heard that they didn't make that character female

1470
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,960
Which it didn't really matter to me because I didn't know about in the first place

1471
02:10:31,080 --> 02:10:33,960
That's a tough one. Good luck to you

1472
02:10:36,520 --> 02:10:38,520
Wait

1473
02:10:39,480 --> 02:10:41,480
I don't

1474
02:10:45,480 --> 02:10:47,480
I don't want to fight furries

1475
02:10:48,680 --> 02:10:52,760
It didn't do anything to me. I was trying to gather focus brother

1476
02:10:59,080 --> 02:11:01,660
Oh, holy shit, they got you one hit

1477
02:11:09,480 --> 02:11:17,160

You guys are some of y'all in the chat are

1480
02:11:29,160 --> 02:11:31,480
Fighting furries is why I go to their conventions

1481
02:11:32,360 --> 02:11:34,360
Star little free

1482
02:11:35,320 --> 02:11:38,120
Forced of wolves and I never guessed

1483
02:11:40,680 --> 02:11:42,680
I'm gonna gather focus

1484
02:11:47,080 --> 02:11:49,480
Okay, I got some yarn. I didn't mean to press that again

1485
02:11:52,600 --> 02:11:54,600
Oh

Oh, you're a big fella, aren't you?

1488
02:11:59,960 --> 02:12:06,920
I'm trying to focus at least I can like do it and run away at the same time

1489
02:12:16,600 --> 02:12:21,800
I just wish I could do that in IRL like come on if I I'm just gonna get a nice stick from outside and do that

1490
02:12:21,800 --> 02:12:23,800

He just he disappeared. All right, let's go. I don't know what that was about

1502
02:13:35,160 --> 02:13:37,160
It's a harlot

1503
02:13:39,480 --> 02:13:45,000

1505
02:13:58,600 --> 02:14:00,600
What the guy ran from

1506
02:14:03,160 --> 02:14:05,480
Uh, oh this one

1507
02:14:09,720 --> 02:14:14,920
Oh, what the hell I just tried to kill a man can I please interact

1508
02:14:18,360 --> 02:14:25,320
I got sconda of form. How is anybody supposed to know that?

1509
02:14:28,760 --> 02:14:30,760
How's he bandius?

1510
02:14:31,080 --> 02:14:35,640
I'm fine with a little bit of back seating because I don't know what the fuck is happening. I want to kill these rabbits

1511
02:14:37,240 --> 02:14:40,360
I thought somebody was knocking at my door and I had a heart attack, but it was my ice maker

1512
02:14:40,440 --> 02:14:50,280
Hello, you look like a rhino

1513
02:14:54,680 --> 02:15:03,960
Oh use gorge to recover health. I don't need that. Oh, that's pretty neat

1514
02:15:10,920 --> 02:15:12,920
Oh

1515
02:15:13,720 --> 02:15:15,720
Um

1516
02:15:18,920 --> 02:15:20,920
I'm a little

1517
02:15:23,960 --> 02:15:29,080
What the hell was that like tricked oh, it's just I'm running

1518
02:15:37,080 --> 02:15:39,080
I'm I'm very scared to fight this thing

1519
02:15:40,840 --> 02:15:43,560
I it is actually very hard to dodge

1520
02:15:48,360 --> 02:15:52,600
Oh, I'm pressing I'm pressing like I'm playing fucking elden ring. That's why I'm fucking up

1521
02:15:55,240 --> 02:15:58,440
I might die actually I kind of want to see what happens when I die

1522
02:16:01,800 --> 02:16:03,960
I die like a skyrim character. That's what happens

1523
02:16:04,200 --> 02:16:06,200
Ah

1524
02:16:10,440 --> 02:16:12,440
The rune of death

1525
02:16:12,840 --> 02:16:20,360
Literally, I'm fighting like it's elden ring and I'm just like why is I'm pressing our our one and r2

1526
02:16:28,360 --> 02:16:30,360
Oh, that's pretty neat

1527
02:16:30,920 --> 02:16:32,920
Cool

1528
02:16:38,760 --> 02:16:41,480
Where was I going from here? I was going straight right

1529
02:16:43,560 --> 02:16:48,200
Is there auto camera because like I don't like that I this happens if I just go to the side

1530
02:16:48,760 --> 02:16:51,480
Like I wish it would just automatically center me. Is that a thing?

1531
02:16:52,680 --> 02:16:54,680
Oh actually

1532
02:16:55,400 --> 02:16:57,400
Oh

1533
02:17:00,680 --> 02:17:02,680
Oh

1534
02:17:16,840 --> 02:17:23,240
How would I want to invert my camera? It just doesn't okay

1535
02:17:27,400 --> 02:17:29,400
Yeah

1536
02:17:30,360 --> 02:17:33,320
But even so like the camera is very weird

1537
02:17:35,240 --> 02:17:38,520
Does it respawn it does respawn dudes

1538
02:17:40,520 --> 02:17:42,520
Interesting

1539
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,160
Why did you sound like mr. Krabs when he said that?

1540
02:17:48,760 --> 02:17:51,800
Sorry, I don't realize how long that takes to charge

1541
02:17:53,400 --> 02:17:55,400
What if I do this

1542
02:17:56,680 --> 02:17:58,680
I'm trying to do something to you. It's not working

1543
02:18:00,840 --> 02:18:02,840
Does this like hurt you?

1544
02:18:06,280 --> 02:18:08,280
Oh, but you can like cancel out of it though

1545
02:18:17,720 --> 02:18:22,600
Do I like lose my runes do I lose my will to live?

1546
02:18:26,600 --> 02:18:28,600
Are you gonna come after me

1547
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,000
Oh, you got me

1548
02:18:45,560 --> 02:18:49,640
I don't lose anything on death what is a yarn for

1549
02:18:49,640 --> 02:18:51,640
Oh

1550
02:18:58,520 --> 02:19:01,720
I don't I meant to press our one

1551
02:19:04,280 --> 02:19:07,480
Looks like sometimes when you're running it looks like little booty cheeks on his back

1552
02:19:13,560 --> 02:19:15,560
Come on, I don't know the controls yet

1553
02:19:19,640 --> 02:19:21,640
I

1554
02:19:39,800 --> 02:19:45,000
Square I'm pretty sure it's like the lies of me. Oh, I'm not really good at dodging yet

1555
02:19:49,640 --> 02:19:51,640
Oh

1556
02:20:13,560 --> 02:20:15,560
Music's nice

1557
02:20:20,440 --> 02:20:22,440
Oh

1558
02:20:30,760 --> 02:20:32,760
What the

1559
02:20:37,560 --> 02:20:39,560
Magic

1560
02:20:41,480 --> 02:20:43,480
Hello

1561
02:20:44,760 --> 02:20:47,720
Are you humping him? What are you doing get down from there?

1562
02:20:50,280 --> 02:20:57,240
Oh, it's been a while, but the immobilized spell still works like a charm

1563
02:20:58,280 --> 02:21:02,280
Why do you have a back scratch? I thought he had like a pipe. It is a back scratcher

1564
02:21:02,280 --> 02:21:07,720
Since you hail from mount waguo, it won't hurt to teach you a handy trick

1565
02:21:08,840 --> 02:21:10,840
Now here we go

1566
02:21:10,840 --> 02:21:12,840
Give me your hand

1567
02:21:13,240 --> 02:21:15,240
I

1568
02:21:17,960 --> 02:21:20,440
Cool there you go

1569
02:21:21,400 --> 02:21:23,720
Should you come across any miscreants?

1570
02:21:24,680 --> 02:21:29,160
Just point your finger at them and release this I don't like

1571
02:21:30,200 --> 02:21:32,200
You'll be able to hold them in place

1572
02:21:32,280 --> 02:21:35,400
But the hand I feel like you should be holding that in the other hands

1573
02:21:36,120 --> 02:21:40,360
Sadly mine is like you should be holding it in the hand it belongs. Sorry

1574
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:44,200
It's power will wear off within a few short moments

1575
02:21:45,320 --> 02:21:48,280
Though it's good enough against boneheads like this one

1576
02:21:49,160 --> 02:21:54,680
Anyway, it probably does. I'd like kind of piss that it looks like fucking shit on my computer

1577
02:21:59,160 --> 02:22:02,520
Are you gonna help me teach him a lesson with your new spell

1578
02:22:02,520 --> 02:22:04,520
Oh

1579
02:22:09,480 --> 02:22:11,480
That didn't do anything

1580
02:22:16,120 --> 02:22:18,120
No run away

1581
02:22:19,960 --> 02:22:21,960
You good

1582
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:28,520
Reefling raid again. Hello again. Reeflings. We're actually playing the game. It looks like poo poo

1583
02:22:33,080 --> 02:22:35,080
Oh

1584
02:22:36,760 --> 02:22:38,760
That's actually pretty fucking sick

1585
02:22:39,640 --> 02:22:45,000
Oh, the game. Oh, I can't lie the fucking gameplay is sick. I am out of juice

1586
02:22:50,600 --> 02:22:52,600
You're so close to death, please let me kill you

1587
02:23:03,240 --> 02:23:05,240
I

1588
02:23:10,520 --> 02:23:12,520
All right

1589
02:23:14,760 --> 02:23:18,520
Hello strongy. Hello. Is this like Sekiro? I have no idea

1590
02:23:19,800 --> 02:23:21,880
Probably I got a spark

1591
02:23:23,160 --> 02:23:28,840
Hello, good reflings. Wait, why was I rated twice? Was there a memory stream?

1592
02:23:29,800 --> 02:23:31,800
Smoshing

1593
02:23:33,320 --> 02:23:39,320
Airplane monkey game. It looks like trash because my computer is literally on fire right now trying to run it

1594
02:23:41,560 --> 02:23:43,560
You're a member lens

1595
02:23:43,560 --> 02:23:45,160
cute

1596
02:23:45,160 --> 02:23:47,160
You don't remember reflins

1597
02:23:47,400 --> 02:23:50,760
Do you remember being a man by reflins?

1598
02:23:52,280 --> 02:23:54,280
double raids

1599
02:23:54,360 --> 02:23:59,000
Oh, we watched Austin Powers. Oh, do be to be

1600
02:24:01,160 --> 02:24:06,760
My parents said when I was younger that I used there was a person that had a really big mole on their face

1601
02:24:07,960 --> 02:24:10,840
And I don't know why my parents ever let me watch the Austin power movie

1602
02:24:11,080 --> 02:24:15,240
But I apparently pointed at the person and went mole mole mole mole

1603
02:24:15,240 --> 02:24:17,240
I

1604
02:24:25,160 --> 02:24:30,040
Was like, I don't know how old I was or maybe I like saw a clip or like they were watching it

1605
02:24:30,040 --> 02:24:34,040
And I was like half paying attention as a child. I have to ask my mom about that

1606
02:24:36,760 --> 02:24:41,400
Oh, the the the the fembots are always nice. Oh, what I thought the game froze

1607
02:24:42,360 --> 02:24:48,360
I'll open up self-advanced to awaken talents level up to gain gain spark. Okay

1608
02:24:49,240 --> 02:24:51,240
Sparks will not be lost upon resurrection

1609
02:24:53,080 --> 02:24:59,080
Resurrection so that means I do lose something. What do I lose upon resurrection? They're insinuating that I lose something

1610
02:25:03,880 --> 02:25:07,640
Get to work totally not posing your own thumb ghosting shortly yippie

1611
02:25:07,640 --> 02:25:09,640
Yay

1612
02:25:12,360 --> 02:25:14,360
Excited

1613
02:25:19,320 --> 02:25:22,840
Do you lose level progression on death? I don't know you lose respect

1614
02:25:25,240 --> 02:25:27,240
Um

1615
02:25:27,320 --> 02:25:29,320
But hi

1616
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:35,560
What's this form is she be called? Uh, it's called Muppet. I'm Muppet she be

1617
02:25:37,640 --> 02:25:39,640
Muppet

1618
02:25:51,160 --> 02:25:55,240
Seeking guidance from the deities better to steer your own path what

1619
02:25:56,040 --> 02:26:00,680
Chanting scriptures better have to have abilities in hands make that make sense

1620
02:26:02,040 --> 02:26:04,040
Oh vigor

1621
02:26:04,040 --> 02:26:06,040
I

1622
02:26:06,600 --> 02:26:12,280
Focus better. Oh snap. What the hell

1623
02:26:16,840 --> 02:26:18,840
Uh

1624
02:26:30,920 --> 02:26:33,640
Each talent level slightly increases the health recovery

1625
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:41,160
Focus point a folk. What the frick is a focus point? What's mysticism?

1626
02:26:48,920 --> 02:26:50,920
Uh

1627
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:57,800
Neo no, I've seen gameplay of neo

1628
02:26:58,360 --> 02:27:05,000
I I did it I couldn't it was boring to me from what I can recall if I'm thinking of the right thing

1629
02:27:10,040 --> 02:27:19,240
You lose in one hour I let unsubscribes you're gonna make me cry we're so close to 15k like what like 400 away

1630
02:27:21,320 --> 02:27:24,520
Moving around a battle highly versatile best choice for engaging into

1631
02:27:25,240 --> 02:27:27,240
Uh

1632
02:27:27,560 --> 02:27:31,400
Enable sprinting while charging. Oh, that would be nice. Holy crap

1633
02:27:41,640 --> 02:27:44,760
Guys I'm not that cool. I cannot do rise a loop counter flow

1634
02:27:45,480 --> 02:27:51,080
This is going to expect me to do combos and I'm gonna be trash at it. I'll tell you that right now

1635
02:27:51,160 --> 02:27:53,160
I

1636
02:27:53,720 --> 02:27:57,320
Don't think I can do this until I get to a certain level. I'm only on level three

1637
02:27:58,680 --> 02:28:02,520
So I can't do pillar stance. What does this even look like? Oh, I'm a snake

1638
02:28:04,600 --> 02:28:06,600
The destined one

1639
02:28:07,480 --> 02:28:09,480
What the hell

1640
02:28:12,600 --> 02:28:14,600
What

1641
02:28:15,560 --> 02:28:17,560
I

1642
02:28:20,600 --> 02:28:23,480
Can just hang out and wait, I just want to see what this looks like

1643
02:28:27,720 --> 02:28:29,720
What

1644
02:28:30,760 --> 02:28:38,280
I literally got to give so many props to the dick game devs for doing all of these animations. Holy crap

1645
02:28:41,560 --> 02:28:43,560
I can just really just

1646
02:28:44,680 --> 02:28:46,680
Oh

1647
02:28:48,680 --> 02:28:50,680
He just climbs the fucking stick

1648
02:28:52,760 --> 02:28:54,760
Oh, I'm something of cool

1649
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:58,520
Quite a bit of a learning curve

1650
02:28:58,520 --> 02:29:02,840
I could see myself getting so caught up in this just like elden ring

1651
02:29:03,320 --> 02:29:04,600
But I will be honest with you

1652
02:29:04,600 --> 02:29:11,160
I probably will not play this again for a long time until I get a better computer because I want to play this game

1653
02:29:11,320 --> 02:29:17,800
And how it's supposed to be I don't want this what looks like a piece of shit

1654
02:29:22,200 --> 02:29:24,200
They didn't mo cap them

1655
02:29:25,960 --> 02:29:27,960
Yeah

1656
02:29:27,960 --> 02:29:29,960
How much is a

1657
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:35,960
Chat make me a list of parts to get nice tummy hurts all of a sudden

1658
02:29:42,120 --> 02:29:46,040
Oh my god, my tummy hurts really bad all of a sudden what's happening to me

1659
02:29:56,040 --> 02:29:58,540
I'm quite overwhelmed right now

1660
02:30:08,360 --> 02:30:10,360
Oh

1661
02:30:11,960 --> 02:30:19,000
Yeah, I want to see the pores coming out of Roshi. I'll do the sprinting little chart. Yeah, I don't

1662
02:30:31,480 --> 02:30:33,480
That's actually pretty

1663
02:30:34,680 --> 02:30:38,200
Hating it with light attack slightly extends though interesting

1664
02:30:38,200 --> 02:30:40,200
Herm

1665
02:30:57,880 --> 02:30:59,880
Why are the skill trees look like this

1666
02:31:08,920 --> 02:31:17,400
So I'm reading no, I don't like Intel I prefer AMD

1667
02:31:17,400 --> 02:31:19,400
Oh

1668
02:31:33,400 --> 02:31:40,120
Okay, that's good good to know. Oh my god. Sorry. Can I kill a rabbit?

1669
02:31:44,360 --> 02:31:46,360
Come here

1670
02:31:47,960 --> 02:31:49,960
Who are you?

1671
02:32:01,320 --> 02:32:03,880
What was that burp in like HD, I don't know

1672
02:32:05,080 --> 02:32:08,600
My tummy hurts all of a sudden. I don't know what's happening

1673
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:16,920
What's up with this fucking frog? Oh he exploded. What the hell? I don't have any gourd

1674
02:32:18,360 --> 02:32:20,360
How do I get more gourd

1675
02:32:23,400 --> 02:32:25,560

1676
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:36,760

1678
02:32:46,600 --> 02:32:49,100
Can I rest for drinks probably

1679
02:32:54,360 --> 02:32:56,360
I don't know where I'm going

1680
02:32:57,400 --> 02:33:04,200
My tummy suddenly horts and I'm sad this game looks like a shit because my pc sucks

1681
02:33:07,480 --> 02:33:09,480
I'll get some aged insane

1682
02:33:12,440 --> 02:33:14,440
How do I know that it's aged

1683
02:33:17,560 --> 02:33:19,560
Isn't it just there

1684
02:33:21,320 --> 02:33:24,280
Is this gonna be like Liza P where shit jumps out at me

1685
02:33:28,440 --> 02:33:30,440
What the fuck are these bugs

1686
02:33:30,440 --> 02:33:32,440
I

1687
02:33:35,560 --> 02:33:40,600
Find a grace well, I didn't ask for a new pc

1688
02:33:45,560 --> 02:33:47,560
Mostly because I

1689
02:33:47,960 --> 02:33:49,560
um

1690
02:33:49,560 --> 02:33:51,560
Didn't want to have to

1691
02:33:52,520 --> 02:33:57,000
Okay, velour back for buying me a pc my first paycheck

1692
02:33:57,880 --> 02:34:03,560
Um for my first few paychecks and I would rather pay and pick a pc myself

1693
02:34:07,640 --> 02:34:13,800
Not my fucking game sound, please let this be like a save station because that'd be bomb

1694
02:34:19,320 --> 02:34:21,320
Yay grace

1695
02:34:21,880 --> 02:34:25,880
It sounds like my singing bowl

1696
02:34:29,480 --> 02:34:31,980
Yeah, I want an alien where are you kidding me

1697
02:34:40,680 --> 02:34:42,680
Third change

1698
02:34:42,760 --> 02:34:44,760
I

1699
02:34:48,840 --> 02:34:56,280
Seen a play through that exploded the pc mid fight for the guy because he put on max graphics Jesus

1700
02:34:59,400 --> 02:35:04,600
Yeah, maybe we'll do a pc building stream. I'll have to do research. Did that heal me?

1701
02:35:06,120 --> 02:35:08,620
I think it did. I don't have any blood around me anymore

1702
02:35:13,320 --> 02:35:20,200
Do you guys want me to put it on max settings and see what happens?

1703
02:35:27,080 --> 02:35:29,080
Let's just stand right here

1704
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:45,000
Oh

1705
02:36:08,520 --> 02:36:10,520
God

1706
02:36:13,240 --> 02:36:15,240
I

1707
02:36:22,280 --> 02:36:24,280
Looped back around

1708
02:36:28,200 --> 02:36:35,160
Oh my god, what's the recommended settings? Oh the medium

1709
02:36:35,400 --> 02:36:37,400
I

1710
02:36:37,960 --> 02:36:41,960
Doesn't really make a difference and a medium look the same to me as the low

1711
02:36:44,120 --> 02:36:46,120
What the hell is this I don't

1712
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:52,520
Like that, but I'm sure that the game would load properly if I

1713
02:36:54,920 --> 02:36:57,080
Like it's normal lighting in the night

1714
02:36:59,480 --> 02:37:01,480
Why does that happen

1715
02:37:02,200 --> 02:37:04,200
I'm

1716
02:37:22,440 --> 02:37:25,560
Like the squishy fucking noises under my monkey feet

1717
02:37:32,200 --> 02:37:34,200
I

1718
02:37:37,080 --> 02:37:39,080
Sorry I was reading what you guys were saying

1719
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:49,160
Like how it's already burnt at the top like it's already been lit. That's very interesting to me

1720
02:37:49,880 --> 02:37:51,880
Oh

1721
02:37:58,120 --> 02:38:00,760
Reallocate, okay, I'm gonna do that actually

1722
02:38:08,040 --> 02:38:10,040
Oh my tummy

1723
02:38:20,120 --> 02:38:22,120
Okay, I have three sparks

1724
02:38:32,600 --> 02:38:36,520
Oh, that's pretty neat this is pretty cool

1725
02:38:44,680 --> 02:38:46,680
I will do that though

1726
02:38:47,640 --> 02:38:49,640
It's just what

1727
02:39:01,880 --> 02:39:04,520
How much money I have nine hundred and sixty eight will

1728
02:39:09,320 --> 02:39:12,520
Crafting weapons that looks like a person

1729
02:39:17,320 --> 02:39:23,960
Can I craft my own medicine probably that does look like a sneak head

1730
02:39:31,400 --> 02:39:33,880
The pc update will be attacked right off

1731
02:39:38,440 --> 02:39:40,440
I'm just walking through the forest

1732
02:39:43,240 --> 02:39:45,240
I don't like your back scratcher

1733
02:39:47,080 --> 02:39:51,400
So you may follow the fires ahead it's called a cicada by the way

1734
02:39:56,760 --> 02:39:58,760
Why did you turn me into a cicada

1735
02:40:02,520 --> 02:40:07,880
It might be humble but my shrine is very versatile you'll get

1736
02:40:08,840 --> 02:40:10,840
Ew

1737
02:40:11,800 --> 02:40:17,320

02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:21,000
I don't like my butt

1739

What does rt do oh I can de-transform how do I

1740
02:40:31,960 --> 02:40:34,680
At least I look cool as a bug like it doesn't look like shit

1741
02:40:41,800 --> 02:40:43,800
Just follow my voice

1742
02:40:55,160 --> 02:40:57,960
I don't know why they want to kill them like why they just like a lot of pass through

1743
02:41:06,680 --> 02:41:08,680
What the hell

1744
02:41:11,400 --> 02:41:14,200
I don't know where the fuck I'm going

1745
02:41:16,680 --> 02:41:21,880
How long am I a bug for doesn't really give me any indicators

Well, it doesn't matter I lost my bug privileges

1785
02:45:49,480 --> 02:45:51,480
I forget that I could immobilize

1786
02:45:51,560 --> 02:45:53,560
I

1787
02:45:56,280 --> 02:45:58,440
Pretty sick. All right, turn me into a bug

1788
02:46:03,320 --> 02:46:07,480
Let's do it. Am I gonna try to take off into into a bug?

1789
02:46:14,120 --> 02:46:16,120
Okay

1790
02:46:17,080 --> 02:46:19,080
I

02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:26,200
Not yeah boy kings. Oh cuz these are mini bosses. Oh

1792
02:46:34,440 --> 02:46:39,480
I just like spinning this I'm not gonna lie to you. I can just sit here and just watch him do this all day

1793
02:46:42,440 --> 02:46:44,440
It's not a spell thing no

1794
02:46:46,200 --> 02:46:48,200
Oh

1795
02:46:48,760 --> 02:46:50,760
Bye

1796
02:46:52,200 --> 02:46:57,160
I'm sitting in game. It's just really satisfying to watch man

1797
02:46:59,800 --> 02:47:05,160
Can I I don't think I can equip it from the inventory maybe I can

1798
02:47:16,200 --> 02:47:18,200
I

1799
02:47:30,200 --> 02:47:32,200
Let's just conclude it's bugged

1800
02:47:33,480 --> 02:47:39,400
Is that like is that a thing in the game like should you be able to fly back each time or maybe there's like

1801
02:47:39,400 --> 02:47:45,080
I'll give you this one thing so you can scout and see what to avoid but then otherwise like you're on your own

1802
02:47:45,320 --> 02:47:47,320
I'm stuck

1803
02:47:59,400 --> 02:48:01,400
Oh wait, you're the kind of

1804
02:48:05,880 --> 02:48:10,280
I'm not locked on you. You look like a human. That kind of looks kind of very odd to me

1805
02:48:10,280 --> 02:48:12,280
Hold on

1806
02:48:21,480 --> 02:48:23,480
Yeah

1807
02:48:40,760 --> 02:48:42,760
You got a spark from it. Oh shit

1808
02:48:45,960 --> 02:48:48,600
Sorry didn't mean to do that. I pressed uh square

1809
02:48:52,920 --> 02:48:57,320
Hit him with the giggle stick. I got the giggle stick

1810
02:49:03,560 --> 02:49:07,880
Oh what the fuck oh that's what this is for

1811
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:13,000
Oh

1812
02:49:16,600 --> 02:49:20,120
That's cool portraits updated

1813
02:49:22,520 --> 02:49:24,520
All right

1814
02:49:27,640 --> 02:49:29,640
Wait

1815
02:49:29,640 --> 02:49:31,640
Oh

1816
02:49:31,720 --> 02:49:33,720
Interesting

1817
02:49:35,080 --> 02:49:37,720
Because i'm like why can I do rt for both of these

1818
02:49:38,360 --> 02:49:41,480
Okay, I'm starting to understand the UI

1819
02:49:42,600 --> 02:49:49,720
Uh, I am having fun. I really love the fight animations. I just I'm just really sad that the game looks like shit

1820
02:49:50,680 --> 02:49:53,080
And is running like shit because of my shit computer

1821
02:49:59,640 --> 02:50:01,640
I'm trying like I kind of want to explore

1822
02:50:01,640 --> 02:50:03,640
I

1823
02:50:05,160 --> 02:50:07,160
My tummy horde

1824
02:50:10,760 --> 02:50:13,880
That's great. I'm gonna go fight over here though

1825
02:50:17,080 --> 02:50:19,240
I keep pressing circle to run

1826
02:50:23,880 --> 02:50:29,160
It doesn't look that yeah, but I know it can look better and that makes me sad. I should probably heal

1827
02:50:32,040 --> 02:50:34,840
How did you already get me?

1828
02:50:43,080 --> 02:50:45,080
I'm scared of you

1829
02:50:46,600 --> 02:50:48,600
At least I know I can do this now

1830
02:50:51,400 --> 02:50:53,400
Oh dammit

1831
02:50:53,400 --> 02:50:55,400
Oh

1832
02:50:59,160 --> 02:51:01,160
Just kill me just do it

1833
02:51:12,760 --> 02:51:14,760
Yes, yes, I know the magic

1834
02:51:17,560 --> 02:51:19,560
How do I turn into a bug then

1835
02:51:20,280 --> 02:51:23,800
You with the chinese characters in the chat that I cannot read

1836
02:51:25,640 --> 02:51:27,640
Tell me how do I turn into this cater?

1837
02:51:41,960 --> 02:51:43,960
Does that guy respawn no

1838
02:51:45,880 --> 02:51:48,600
No, oh, I didn't mean to jump off. Uh, it's fine

1839
02:51:50,520 --> 02:51:53,000
You know what it worked out swimmingly

1840
02:51:54,200 --> 02:51:56,200
Get it swimmingly

1841
02:51:57,240 --> 02:51:59,880
Because I am swimming in a river

1842
02:52:00,680 --> 02:52:02,680
Hold on pause

1843
02:52:03,880 --> 02:52:05,880
We tried asking

1844
02:52:06,520 --> 02:52:09,080
Let manifest our voices what?

1845
02:52:11,640 --> 02:52:13,640
I was swimming

1846
02:52:13,880 --> 02:52:17,080
We have to make the best just try to make the best character

1847
02:52:17,800 --> 02:52:21,720
Repent and believe the lord you what?

1848
02:52:26,600 --> 02:52:28,600
Okay

1849
02:52:29,240 --> 02:52:31,240
Cicada was a one-time thing. Okay

1850
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:38,360
I mean if you believe in reincarnation, you can always roll the dice and hope that you're cicada next time

1851
02:52:42,920 --> 02:52:44,920
You love you love this model

1852
02:52:45,880 --> 02:52:47,880
You like my model

1853
02:52:51,800 --> 02:52:54,440
I'm wondering if this person is serious or not

1854
02:53:01,800 --> 02:53:03,800
Stop

1855
02:53:07,800 --> 02:53:09,800

1856
02:53:15,640 --> 02:53:17,640

02:53:24,520 --> 02:53:28,520
How do you look like fly I don't like that you look like fly

1858
02:53:36,520 --> 02:53:38,520
Oh

1859
02:53:38,520 --> 02:53:44,520
I'm scared

1860
02:53:51,080 --> 02:53:53,400
I'm trying to dodge when I ran a stamina

1861
02:53:58,040 --> 02:54:00,040
Oh

1862
02:54:09,240 --> 02:54:13,160
What what just happened? I'm pressing why

1863
02:54:23,480 --> 02:54:25,480
What was that?

1864
02:54:38,760 --> 02:54:40,760
Oh, that's pretty fucking cool

1865
02:54:51,800 --> 02:54:53,800
Oh, I'm on fire

1866
02:55:09,240 --> 02:55:12,520
That's so cool. I'm sorry the mini boss is just like

1867
02:55:20,600 --> 02:55:26,920
I feel better about panic rolling. Oh, oh, no, please don't kill me. Please don't kill me. Please don't

1868
02:55:28,040 --> 02:55:32,040
Man, I was so I was so I was admiring your form

1869
02:55:39,240 --> 02:55:41,240
All right

1870
02:55:43,720 --> 02:55:45,720
Can't just say all wolf men look alike

1871
02:55:49,800 --> 02:55:51,800
Maybe I will

1872
02:55:54,840 --> 02:55:56,840
You gentlemen

1873
02:56:09,400 --> 02:56:19,400
Is there a way to be stealthy in this game can I crouch no

1874
02:56:25,080 --> 02:56:27,560
Hello, I'm back. Let me just get my stamina back up

1875
02:56:30,280 --> 02:56:32,280
And hold it right there

1876
02:56:39,320 --> 02:56:42,120
I need to charge that as much as I wanted to

1877
02:56:47,320 --> 02:56:49,320
All right, okay

1878
02:56:53,800 --> 02:56:55,800
I dodged

1879
02:56:57,640 --> 02:57:01,080
Oh, I love how it slow mows that sorry I'm getting so excited

1880
02:57:08,760 --> 02:57:10,760
Oh

1881
02:57:20,840 --> 02:57:22,840
Hold on I'm healing stop

1882
02:57:33,720 --> 02:57:35,800
Oh, that's not fair

1883
02:57:36,760 --> 02:57:39,080
If I stand in front of this can you hit me?

1884
02:57:46,520 --> 02:57:48,680
No stop it

1885
02:58:02,040 --> 02:58:04,440
I didn't mean to press that I'm gonna press this

1886
02:58:06,760 --> 02:58:08,760
Oh

1887
02:58:10,760 --> 02:58:14,840
Fuck me brother just just killing me I I'm shit at this gameplay so far

1888
02:58:20,600 --> 02:58:25,960
I'm in trance by sick monkey moves that's doormomo. I have come to bargain

1889
02:58:30,200 --> 02:58:32,680
It's the cake it would be pretty stealthy that's right

1890
02:58:36,200 --> 02:58:38,200
I

1891
02:58:39,800 --> 02:58:42,200
Yes, I'm being bullied by a strong wolf man

1892
02:58:43,800 --> 02:58:47,400
Why can't I turn into a cicada again? That's some bullshit

1893
02:58:48,840 --> 02:58:50,840
I have to run over here

1894
02:58:56,040 --> 02:59:00,680
Hurrah, what the fuck did that tree just move like that for?

1895
02:59:06,520 --> 02:59:08,520

I'm pressing why

1900
02:59:35,080 --> 02:59:37,080
Oh my god

1901
02:59:48,200 --> 02:59:50,280
Oh, I just realized that's the same move

1902
02:59:55,640 --> 02:59:59,240
Okay, he doesn't exactly get stunned by that. Oh my god, please

1903
03:00:01,080 --> 03:00:03,080
No

1904
03:00:05,080 --> 03:00:07,080
Oh

1905
03:00:07,400 --> 03:00:09,400

Oh

1908
03:00:33,880 --> 03:00:39,660
Samina is very important for the for I realized for this game. Usually I don't give a shit about stamina

1909
03:00:41,400 --> 03:00:43,400
Oh

1910
03:00:56,600 --> 03:00:59,240
I'm so happy I can run and heal at the same time. Thank fucking god

1911
03:01:06,920 --> 03:01:09,160
Oh the thing is you'll break my stance

1912
03:01:11,800 --> 03:01:13,800
Oh

1913
03:01:19,240 --> 03:01:23,640
I'm on fire, please I don't have any stamina to fucking roll

1914
03:01:42,360 --> 03:01:44,360
Oh I can do that

1915
03:02:06,520 --> 03:02:10,920
Oh, I forgot about that move I pressed I pressed sprint instead of dodge

1916
03:02:12,200 --> 03:02:14,200
I'm just gonna let him yeah, I'm on fire

1917
03:02:16,360 --> 03:02:20,680
Because the monkey business pretty nice pretty good. Yeah

1918
03:02:24,200 --> 03:02:26,200
I thought like I I the thing is

1919
03:02:27,000 --> 03:02:33,960
I think I'm hold like I'll hold it to focus, but then I'm not actually focusing personally. I feel like I'm holding it

1920
03:02:35,240 --> 03:02:37,240
Like because I'll be like this

1921
03:02:37,800 --> 03:02:39,800
And

1922
03:02:41,880 --> 03:02:43,240
It'll

1923
03:02:43,240 --> 03:02:47,000
Like I'll hold it thinking it's doing them that and then it's not for some reason

1924
03:02:48,040 --> 03:02:50,040
That's on me because I'm just not used to it yet

1925
03:02:56,360 --> 03:02:58,360
Uh my butt itches, sorry

1926
03:03:01,080 --> 03:03:04,920

03:03:10,360 --> 03:03:12,360
Serpentine serpentine serpentine

1938
03:04:21,160 --> 03:04:23,160

1939
03:04:38,200 --> 03:04:40,200
I

1940

Oh

1948
03:06:57,720 --> 03:06:59,720
I'm trying to get out of the way

1949
03:07:04,360 --> 03:07:08,040
Happy I healed I can never dodge the second one for some reason

1950
03:07:09,240 --> 03:07:11,240
Oh

1951
03:07:33,800 --> 03:07:35,800
That move is fucking bitch

1952
03:07:40,040 --> 03:07:42,040
All right, well

1953
03:07:49,880 --> 03:07:51,880
Spongebob me boy

1954
03:07:54,920 --> 03:07:57,560
Thunder scores frost and poison interesting

1955
03:08:09,960 --> 03:08:16,360
Oh, I don't need to be here to do that

1956
03:08:32,760 --> 03:08:34,760
How I need to do that before I can do that

1957
03:08:39,240 --> 03:08:41,240
Oh

1958
03:08:52,920 --> 03:08:54,920
I might do that

1959
03:09:02,920 --> 03:09:04,920
Let's let's do that

1960
03:09:04,920 --> 03:09:06,920
I

1961
03:09:07,800 --> 03:09:09,800
Realize I have like my life video

1962
03:09:09,800 --> 03:09:11,800
But I'm not even here

1963
03:09:33,960 --> 03:09:35,960
I want to beat this fucking dude

1964
03:09:36,920 --> 03:09:38,920
I've got a piss

1965
03:09:39,640 --> 03:09:43,240
I'll be honest with you. This kind of just makes you want to play Alden ring because I know how to play that game

1966
03:09:44,040 --> 03:09:48,520
I like this game a lot though again. I'm just discredits because it looks like shit

1967
03:09:48,520 --> 03:09:50,520
Wait

1968
03:10:04,440 --> 03:10:07,560
At least I can just kind of run around here. What's over here actually

1969
03:10:12,520 --> 03:10:14,520
What the fuck

1970
03:10:15,720 --> 03:10:17,720
Excuse me

1971
03:10:19,480 --> 03:10:21,480
Oh

1972
03:10:23,000 --> 03:10:25,000
I just got killed by a fucking flower

1973
03:10:27,080 --> 03:10:32,760
Oh my god, you're telling me there's mimic flowers

1974
03:10:35,320 --> 03:10:37,320
Thank god, I don't drop anything

1975
03:10:41,960 --> 03:10:43,960
This game is forgiving in that case

1976
03:10:49,480 --> 03:10:51,480
I'm stuck

1977
03:10:53,800 --> 03:10:56,120
All right, don't touch the flower

1978
03:10:59,320 --> 03:11:03,320
What about this one is this one dangerous? No, this one's fine

1979
03:11:03,560 --> 03:11:21,560
It's weird I can also sorry I'm really I can hold or I can toggle sprint

1980
03:11:23,000 --> 03:11:27,480
With the little with the joystick, but I can also do r1 which is odd

1981
03:11:33,320 --> 03:11:36,280
No pressing the wrong button

1982
03:12:03,320 --> 03:12:05,320
Oh

1983
03:12:33,640 --> 03:12:35,640
Oh

1984
03:12:39,800 --> 03:12:42,680
I keep walking back into it because the fucking camera

1985
03:13:00,440 --> 03:13:02,440
Oh

1986
03:13:03,320 --> 03:13:06,040
Oh

1987
03:13:34,040 --> 03:13:36,040
Oh

1988
03:13:37,560 --> 03:13:39,560
One health and a dream

1989
03:13:45,320 --> 03:13:47,320
How did that hit me

1990
03:13:57,880 --> 03:13:59,880
One health and a dream boys one health and a dream

1991
03:14:03,400 --> 03:14:12,520
All right, I think it's the next one I am feeling good

1992
03:14:19,480 --> 03:14:22,120
Let me just not get fucking hit by NPCs so with that

1993
03:14:26,520 --> 03:14:29,800
Did you guys see that though like you guys saw that like eight like

1994
03:14:29,800 --> 03:14:34,840
Uh, I think it was because it's the flames. Excuse me

1995
03:14:38,200 --> 03:14:41,000
Kind of feel it someone's watching me as I'm running around

1996
03:14:41,720 --> 03:14:43,720
Oh

1997
03:14:57,800 --> 03:14:59,800
Yeah coming out the gate with that

1998
03:15:07,400 --> 03:15:09,400

What am I doing oh my god, please

2007
03:16:55,320 --> 03:17:00,840
I literally run up to focus and it doesn't fucking focus

2008
03:17:01,080 --> 03:17:06,760
I don't understand. I'm pressing the button to focus to do the fucking move

2009
03:17:07,240 --> 03:17:09,240
Oh

2010
03:17:10,840 --> 03:17:17,240

2020
03:20:28,760 --> 03:20:30,760

2347
03:48:19,260 --> 03:48:21,020
um

2348
03:48:21,020 --> 03:48:23,020
So I'm doing something a little bit different

2349
03:48:23,340 --> 03:48:25,340
than a Zura

2350
03:48:25,820 --> 03:48:27,660
Azura's thing

2351
03:48:27,660 --> 03:48:32,620
I'm adding a punishment wheel and the punishments the straw me put

2352
03:48:34,460 --> 03:48:37,420

2353

Yeah, I'm gonna do the flat cable amazon. Why did you crash? Hello?

2354
03:48:51,420 --> 03:48:53,420
All right

2355
03:48:53,980 --> 03:48:58,140
Flat ethernet cable 50 feet

2356
03:49:04,540 --> 03:49:06,540
Does it come with stuff?

2357
03:49:11,820 --> 03:49:19,100
What is the difference between 40 gb gbps versus cat 6 10 gbps that says cat 8

2358
03:49:20,060 --> 03:49:22,060
I'm assuming I want the cat 8 one

2359
03:49:29,100 --> 03:49:31,600
Cat 8 40 gigabytes per second

2360
03:49:34,860 --> 03:49:38,940
Speed I am speed I probably a 30 foot one would be fine actually

2361
03:49:41,660 --> 03:49:47,340
Um, does it come with little thingies does it come with little pins

2362
03:49:50,060 --> 03:49:55,500
I had them at my parents house when I lived there. Does it come with it?

2363
03:49:59,020 --> 03:50:01,020
Snagless design

2364
03:50:02,380 --> 03:50:04,380

2365
03:50:07,900 --> 03:50:10,460
Wait does it I can't fucking tell bro

2366
03:50:11,260 --> 03:50:21,260
Stop posting fucking pictures and just tell me if it comes with the little things to stick it to the wall

2367
03:50:24,380 --> 03:50:29,260
Because my cats will fucking bite it. That's another reason why I don't have those cables

2368
03:50:33,580 --> 03:50:35,580
This one doesn't have it

04:28:10,080 --> 04:28:14,400
Of dialogue. I can't watch yugioh gameplay with no dialogue

2773

That works that works. Oh fuck it's stuck to me. It's fine. It's stuck to me, but it's fine

3012
04:48:29,520 --> 04:48:31,520

Um, okay, let's get let's get mercy and then let me know we'll save the best for last

3016
04:48:52,640 --> 04:48:54,640
Oh my god, okay, sorry

3017
04:48:54,720 --> 04:48:58,400

3020
04:49:17,680 --> 04:49:19,680
Hold on because this is like

3021
04:49:21,920 --> 04:49:24,480
I'm trying to make a family portrait

3022
04:49:30,240 --> 04:49:34,320
That was properly sized. I'm gonna put mercy on the other side of stronti

3023
04:49:36,400 --> 04:49:38,400

Wait, maybe I could put mercy right above stronti

3029
04:50:09,840 --> 04:50:15,680
This doesn't make sense because of our heights, but it's fine. Um, let's try it again

3030
04:50:15,840 --> 04:50:29,600
I just make mercy just like creeping

3031
04:50:34,480 --> 04:50:36,640
I don't know. I don't know where to put mercy

3032
04:50:38,880 --> 04:50:40,880
I don't know what if I

3033
04:50:41,680 --> 04:50:43,680

Wait, what if I do this I give her a very small body

3082
04:56:25,840 --> 04:56:27,840

Over here, but it shows up on there. I don't see any

3166

Deep breath, sheepy, deep breath, deep breath, sheepy.

05:31:23,320 --> 05:31:29,320
Oh fuck, it's still attached.

No, let go.

3336
05:31:34,320 --> 05:31:38,320
I can't handle the fever.

3337
05:31:38,320 --> 05:31:41,320
Why is it still attached to me?

3338
05:31:41,320 --> 05:31:51,320
Stop, we'll get on the touch, okay.

3339
05:31:51,320 --> 05:31:54,320
Pick a number one through five.

3340
05:31:54,320 --> 05:32:03,320
Actually wait, no, never mind.

3341
05:32:03,320 --> 05:32:26,320
Wait, I need to, maybe if I do this,

3342
05:32:26,320 --> 05:32:36,320
I can make myself small enough.

3343
05:32:36,320 --> 05:32:38,320
No, it's hard.

3344
05:32:38,320 --> 05:32:44,320
Okay, it doesn't matter.

3345
05:32:44,320 --> 05:33:09,320
It insists.

3346
05:33:09,320 --> 05:33:11,320
I can't move her.

3347
05:33:11,320 --> 05:33:16,320
My head is like a small floating dot.

3348
05:33:16,320 --> 05:33:19,320
You can see this is my head.

3349
05:33:19,320 --> 05:33:24,320
I was trying to like stick myself to it.

3350
05:33:24,320 --> 05:33:27,320
But it wasn't working.

3351
05:33:27,320 --> 05:33:31,320
Wait, will it work now?

3352
05:33:31,320 --> 05:33:34,320
No, it won't.

3353
05:33:34,320 --> 05:33:36,320
Hey, you can't see me if I go into her hair.

3354
05:33:36,320 --> 05:33:44,320
I'm like a little, I'm like a little louse.

3355
05:33:44,320 --> 05:33:57,320
She's looking at me.

3356
05:33:57,320 --> 05:34:05,320
Am I going to get in trouble for this?

3357
05:34:05,320 --> 05:34:09,320
It's even more naked than I am.

3358
05:34:09,320 --> 05:34:14,320
No, no, I didn't want to load it as fucking live duty.

3359
05:34:14,320 --> 05:34:30,320
No.

3360
05:34:30,320 --> 05:34:52,320
Am I over tired or what?

3361
05:34:52,320 --> 05:34:55,320
Anyways, have a great time.

3362
05:34:55,320 --> 05:34:57,320
It'll be a radical raid.

3363
05:34:57,320 --> 05:35:01,320
Hold on, let me make sure this person is still streaming.

3364
05:35:01,320 --> 05:35:04,320
Oh my God, they're probably not.

3365
05:35:04,320 --> 05:35:08,320
Never mind.

3366
05:35:08,320 --> 05:35:11,320
Or maybe they're going to keep going.

3367
05:35:11,320 --> 05:35:16,320
You know what, I'm going to go to the actual,

3368
05:35:16,320 --> 05:35:20,320
I'm going to go, you know what, I'm too tired to do that.

3369
05:35:20,320 --> 05:35:21,320
I was going to go to the stream.

3370
05:35:21,320 --> 05:35:22,320
She started streaming at seven.

3371
05:35:22,320 --> 05:35:27,320
It should be fine.

3372
05:35:27,320 --> 05:35:28,320
Okay.

3373
05:35:28,320 --> 05:35:30,320
All right.

3374
05:35:30,320 --> 05:35:33,320
I'm stinky, you're stinky.

3375
05:35:33,320 --> 05:35:35,320
We're all stinky together today.

3376
05:35:35,320 --> 05:35:43,320
I'm going to go take a shower and cry and debate my,

3377
05:35:43,320 --> 05:35:51,320
and wonder why I am the way I am.

3378
05:35:52,320 --> 05:35:54,320
I didn't say sticky.

3379
05:35:54,320 --> 05:35:56,320
I said stinky.

3380
05:35:56,320 --> 05:36:00,320
Why are you stinky?

3381
05:36:00,320 --> 05:36:12,320
Okay.

3382
05:36:12,320 --> 05:36:22,320
What is free age, I mean?

3383
05:36:22,320 --> 05:36:27,320
There's a G now.

3384
05:36:27,320 --> 05:36:36,320
Why are you laughing at G?

3385
05:36:36,320 --> 05:36:41,320
I'm kind of running down my vagina.

3386
05:36:41,320 --> 05:36:43,320
All right, I'm leaving.

3387
05:36:43,320 --> 05:36:44,320
Goodbye.
