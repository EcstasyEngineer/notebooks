2548220	2550860	All right.
2554860	2556460	I keep falling on the other side.
2571740	2576060	What if you jumped to the other side? You want us to jump? All right.

2594140	2606940	I was so busy laughing at Freya just running off that I couldn't. I didn't walk backwards to stop
2606940	2616380	Azura from flying off and I literally. I was trying to pull. I can't. I'm literally ori losing my voice
2616620	2618940	laughing and yelling.

2701420	2703900	A player has disconnected, respawning.
2708220	2713500	Wait, if she spawns back in, is she gonna appear with us? I think so. All right.
2714460	2717980	Azura, make as much progress as we can while she's gone.
2720220	2729180	She's dragging a pole. Damn, damn. I think my game is not framed properly on OPS.

2821900	2827180	I can't move. There are chains turned silver. I swear they were black earlier.
2829340	2835100	Hello, everybody. I am Apollo. Thank you so much for following me. I am the goddess of music.
2836460	2842620	Oh, this one's gonna be a killer and a bitch. Sorry. No, no, you're fine. This is gonna be a killer.
2842620	2850620	Look at that. Oh, all right. We did it before when they were. All right. So we just got to run and jump.
2853820	2858380	Or die. That's all so good. We're fine. We're fine. We're fine.
2860380	2863900	Back off from those lasers. I'm crying.
2863900	2868860	I can't. Okay, I'm pulling. I'm pulling. Move back. Move back.
2872860	2877980	That actually helped us. I think we're still going. Yeah, we're still, we're still in it. We're still in it.
2877980	2881500	I'm up. I'm up. I'm up. I'm up. I'm back down. I'm up.
2886540	2890220	Oh, she's loop-jumped her. Wait, I wonder if this will be to our advantage. Can we jump?
2890220	2892940	Yeah. Let's try it. Let's try it. Ready? Ready? Let's go.
2892940	2898620	Let's get closer. Let's go. Jump. It's fine. We're good. We got the hack, bros.
2903260	2909260	We're just looping around. Wait, if Rhea jumps over. No, I just have to do good.
2912860	2919420	It's fine. I'm backing up. I was trying to run away from it.
2919740	2927020	The struggle is real. We're so math flying.
2928620	2933260	All right. I mean, we did do it like that though. Like run and jump. One on the side
2934060	2940540	and then one in the middle. We've got this. Let's do it. Okay. Cool. Run. Run. Jump again.
2941980	2946460	No, if you sprint. I think we should run. I think we should run with it and then jump
2946540	2949580	over and let's come back. I agree, you're a strat.
2951580	2951880	Okay.

3004020	3005020	I'm not letting go.
3005020	3006020	I'm not letting go.
3006020	3007020	I'm not letting go.
3007020	3008020	Wow.
3008020	3010020	This is a beautiful mountain gelmere.
3010020	3012020	You got Mordor over there.
3012020	3013020	Damn.
3013020	3014020	Where'd the guy go?
3014020	3016020	Oh, he's all the way down there.
3016020	3018020	Now look at him.
3018020	3020020	Oh, here's the screams of the dams.
3020020	3022020	Oh, there he is.

3027020	3029020	No, fly more.
3029020	3030020	You can let go.
3030020	3032020	It'll automatically drop us.
3032020	3034020	Oh, the car.
3034020	3036020	Oh, we got a car.
3036020	3038020	Oh, well.
3038020	3040020	Allo.
3040020	3042020	Have fun.
3043020	3046020	I like how this guy always is just like,
3046020	3048020	if you move your mouse around,
3048020	3050020	he just like goes to the opposite.
3050020	3052020	I love you.
3052020	3053020	Okay.
3053020	3054020	Here you go.

3055020	3056020	Here you go.
3056020	3057020	Zoom through it.
3057020	3058020	Ah!
3058020	3060020	She hesitated.
3060020	3062020	Hesitation means death.
3062020	3064020	Where'd the car go?
3064020	3067020	Hesitation is the thing.
3067020	3069020	So, who's turn is the next?
3069020	3071020	I'm ready to drive this flight.
3071020	3072020	Go for it.
3072020	3074020	Go for it.
3074020	3076020	Here we go.
3076020	3078020	I'm so ready for Fran.
3078020	3080020	Well, I love her.
3080020	3082020	Drive the song.
3082020	3084020	You're the queen.
3084020	3086020	She was gonna drive the song.
3090020	3092020	Never let Apollo drive.
3092020	3094020	What do you mean?
3094020	3095020	Never let Fran drive.
3095020	3096020	Okay, Azera.
3096020	3098020	Azera, you're next.
3098020	3100020	Azera, drive.
3101020	3103020	No Fran, don't touch it yet.
3103020	3104020	I'm not.
3104020	3105020	I'm not.
3105020	3106020	I'm not.
3106020	3108020	Clicky, clicky, clicky.
3108020	3110020	Azera, you got this.
3110020	3112020	To the left, to the left turn.
3112020	3114020	To the left, to the left turn.
3114020	3116020	Alright, Apollo might have to be the one
3116020	3118020	that drives us.
3118020	3120020	Why is the turn so long?
3120020	3122020	It's hard to steer.
3122020	3124020	Wait, what do you steer with?
3124020	3126020	I don't know.
3126020	3128020	At the AD.
3128020	3130020	Oh, okay.
3138020	3140020	Oh, my God.
3140020	3142020	The AD is AD.
3142020	3144020	She's always just A and B.
3144020	3145020	Okay.
3145020	3147020	A and D and...
3149020	3152020	I wonder if you know how to live in Tokyo
3152020	3154020	if you see it and you need it
3154020	3156020	and you know you got to go
3156020	3158020	faster than you.
3161020	3163020	To the left, to the left slowly.
3165020	3167020	Rose, it's alright.
3167020	3169020	I'm a pro.
3169020	3171020	I'm a pro.
3171020	3173020	I'm a pro.
3178020	3180020	Come back, come back.
3180020	3182020	The AD is real.
3183020	3185020	I didn't think you...
3185020	3187020	Okay, okay.
3187020	3189020	We're fine.
3189020	3191020	We're good.
3191020	3193020	You're a pro.
3193020	3195020	Pro-stress.
3195020	3197020	Oh, my God, oh, my God.
3197020	3199020	We made it, boys.
3199020	3201020	We made it.
3201020	3203020	Years of Mario Kart.
3203020	3205020	Owned my skill.
3205020	3207020	Now this part, we just got to time it
3207020	3209020	to what the direction is.
3209020	3211020	We shouldn't be too hard, I believe.
3211020	3213020	And we just got, you can just jump.
3213020	3215020	Yeah, I want to get closer.
3215020	3217020	We just jump on it and kind of do it.
3217020	3220020	We just jump until it turns because, yeah.
3220020	3222020	Okay.
3222020	3224020	And go.
3224020	3226020	And jump.
3228020	3230020	And jump.
3230020	3232020	And jump.
3232020	3234020	There you go, there you go.
3234020	3236020	We're back, we're back.
3236020	3238020	And jump.
3238020	3240020	There's a weird version of dance, dance, revolution.
3240020	3242020	For some reason.
3242020	3244020	Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit.
3246020	3248020	I tried to recover it, I tried.
3248020	3250020	Oh, wait.
3250020	3252020	Oh, we're back here?
3252020	3254020	Oh, okay.
3254020	3256020	Oh, we missed our ride.
3256020	3258020	Well, hey, it's okay.
3258020	3260020	Oh, wait, let's go back.
3260020	3262020	And go.
3262020	3264020	Wait, we're going back.
3264020	3266020	Wait, are we going back?
3266020	3268020	No, we're going to the right spot.
3268020	3270020	Oh, for a second it glitched out for me.
3270020	3272020	And I was like, we what?
3272020	3274020	Oh, hello.
3274020	3276020	I can't get about it.
3276020	3278020	Okay, jump, jump, jump.
3278020	3280020	Oh, perfect. There we go.
3280020	3282020	Got it, got it, got it, got it.
3282020	3284020	Hello, thank you so much for coming.
3284020	3286020	I'm getting like, super pulled here.
3286020	3288020	I'm sorry.
3288020	3290020	I have no control over what I do.
3290020	3292020	Sign in, sign.
3292020	3294020	We just got back.
3294020	3296020	Sign in, sign.
3296020	3298020	We just got to climb up.
3298020	3300020	Oh, is this just jumping?
3300020	3302020	Okay, jump.
3302020	3304020	If one of us can't make it, we just kind of pull them.
3304020	3306020	Yeah, the rest of us can make it.
3306020	3308020	We got this.
3308020	3310020	Oh, oh, I'm falling.
3310020	3312020	Okay, no, we're good, we're good, come on.
3312020	3314020	Pull me up, pull me up, bro.
3314020	3316020	Pull me up, bro.
3316020	3318020	Yippee.
3318020	3320020	Move over here.
3320020	3322020	Wait, just kidding.
3322020	3324020	Oh, my God.
3324020	3326020	Oh, you can jump on the corners.
3326020	3328020	Oh, okay, that makes it a lot easier.
3328020	3330020	Can I pull Azura?
3330020	3332020	Okay.
3332020	3334020	Thank you.
3334020	3336020	So we can just jump up onto the corner?
3336020	3338020	Yeah.
3338020	3340020	Yeah?
3340020	3342020	Sometimes it lets me.
3342020	3344020	All right, when you guys are free,
3344020	3346020	can you pull?
3346020	3348020	Pull here, pull over here.
3348020	3350020	Yay, I made it.
3350020	3352020	Why am I stuck under?
3352020	3354020	All right, perfect.
3354020	3356020	Perfect.
3356020	3358020	Yeah.
3358020	3360020	How are you able to do that?
3360020	3362020	I was able to do it once
3362020	3364020	and then I couldn't do it again.
3364020	3366020	I think only two people can do it at a time.
3366020	3368020	I am dead.
3368020	3370020	There we go, there we go, there we go.
3370020	3372020	One of these flames of fire.
3372020	3374020	Where do we go next?
3374020	3376020	We go that way?
3376020	3378020	All right.
3378020	3380020	One.
3380020	3382020	Oh, God.
3382020	3384020	This is just jumping, this will be easier.
3384020	3386020	Azura, lead the way.
3386020	3388020	Me, why me?
3388020	3390020	Because you get pulled around by us,
3390020	3392020	so it's your turn to pull us.
3392020	3394020	Why am I off to the side?
3394020	3396020	I am always standing sideways.
3396020	3398020	Any home?
3398020	3400020	What?
3400020	3402020	It's a small jump, it's a small jump.
3402020	3404020	You got to go push and then back.
3404020	3406020	Push back.
3406020	3408020	Oh, no.
3408020	3410020	Oh, no.
3410020	3412020	Okay, okay, okay.
3412020	3414020	It's all over you.

3676360	3678200	Swingings, are you swinging?
3678200	3679600	I'm just constantly pulling.
3679600	3681240	I'm not swinging anymore.
3681240	3682680	All right, all right, there we go.
3682680	3684520	Stay calm.
3684520	3686240	Stay calm, collected.

3690360	3691360	I made it.
3691360	3693320	Yeah, let's jump across.
3693320	3696800	Then that gives us some more room.
3696800	3703760	Yeah, it's your sensitivity, so why?
3703760	3707200	You just fly off the platform when you get up.
3707200	3708680	OK, ready?
3708680	3709180	Ready?
3709180	3710600	Really bad at video games.
3710600	3713280	Three, two, one.
3713280	3714280	That was a little early.
3714280	3716000	Speedcore.
3716000	3717240	Speedrun, go.
3717240	3718520	Speedrun, go.
3718520	3719520	Oh, never mind.
3724400	3726200	Speedrun is not in my speedrun.
3727800	3729800	OK, OK.
3729800	3732800	I like how far the stairs are to follow.
3732800	3735800	Oh, jeez.
3735800	3736800	I'm trying to pull.
3736800	3738800	I'm trying to pull.

3742800	3744800	Nice count.
3744800	3748800	What is this?
3748800	3751800	We were so unified before.
3751800	3752800	Easy jump.
3752800	3753800	Easy jump.
3753800	3754800	We've got this.
3754800	3755800	Easy.
3756800	3758800	Easy jump.
3758800	3759800	Oh, no, this next thing was.
3759800	3760800	Pause.

3762800	3765800	We're fine.
3765800	3766800	OK, we just got out of there.
3766800	3768800	This has to be timing.
3768800	3769800	Ready?
3769800	3770800	Here we go.
3770800	3772800	Get closer, Sarah.
3772800	3774800	Go.
3774800	3776800	Go.
3776800	3777800	Wait.
3777800	3779800	I don't think we did a good job.
3779800	3781800	Oh.
3781800	3784800	I am fine.
3784800	3787800	Oh, never mind.

3792800	3793800	Get closer, everyone.
3793800	3794800	Everyone, Azora.
3794800	3797800	Azora, honey.
3797800	3798800	OK.
3798800	3799800	Wait.
3799800	3800800	Wait.
3800800	3801800	Wait.
3801800	3803800	Jump.
3803800	3806800	Why did I overshoot that?
3806800	3809800	I don't understand.
3809800	3811800	Well.
3811800	3813800	Oh, we're fine.
3813800	3814800	We're fine.
3814800	3815800	We're fine.
3815800	3816800	We're fine.
3816800	3817800	We're fine.
3817800	3819800	OK, we just need to pull them up and quickly.
3819800	3821800	No.
3821800	3822800	Jump.
3822800	3824800	Oh, make it to that one.
3824800	3825800	Next one.
3825800	3826800	Smart.
3826800	3827800	Smart.
3827800	3828800	All right.
3828800	3829800	Where do we go now?
3829800	3830800	Which way are we going?
3830800	3834800	I'm trying to climb.
3834800	3835800	Wait.
3835800	3836800	OK, OK.
3836800	3838800	Oh, we're back to the top.
3838800	3839800	All right.
3839800	3840800	Go.
3840800	3841800	This way?
3842800	3843800	Oh.
3843800	3844800	It's fine.
3844800	3845800	It's fine.
3850800	3852800	Dude, this is so fun.
3852800	3853800	No.
3853800	3854800	Oh, my God.
3854800	3855800	All right.
3855800	3856800	OK, OK, OK.
3856800	3858800	We got a speed run this.
3858800	3859800	Yeah.
3859800	3860800	OK, ready?
3860800	3861800	Shift the sprint.
3861800	3862800	Got it.
3862800	3863800	Jump.
3863800	3864800	Ready.
3864800	3865800	Jump.
3865800	3866800	Jump.
3866800	3867800	Oh, what the heck?
3867800	3868800	Yeah, me too.
3868800	3870800	I think you jump farther when you sprint.
3871800	3874800	We don't sprint until the jump is made.
3874800	3875800	OK.
3875800	3876800	I agree.
3876800	3877800	I don't know what's happening.
3877800	3878800	I'm just kind of just hanging out.
3878800	3879800	Oh.
3879800	3881800	Oh, I got us.
3881800	3882800	Wait.
3882800	3885800	We're going to be head down.
3885800	3886800	OK.
3886800	3887800	OK.
3887800	3892800	I guess no shift yet until when your feet are on the ground.
3892800	3893800	Got it.
3893800	3894800	Yeah.
3894800	3895800	OK.
3895800	3896800	Next one.
3896800	3897800	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3897800	3898800	OK.
3898800	3899800	Let's do this.
3899800	3900800	OK.
3900800	3901800	And go.
3901800	3902800	And oh.
3902800	3903800	Oh.
3903800	3904800	Oh.
3904800	3905800	Oh.
3905800	3906800	Yeah.
3906800	3907800	Carry us.
3907800	3908800	Carry us to victory queen.
3908800	3909800	We found out.
3909800	3910800	We found out.
3910800	3911800	Oh.
3911800	3912800	We found out.
3912800	3913800	We found out.
3913800	3914800	We found out.
3914800	3915800	We found out.
3915800	3916800	We found out.
3916800	3917800	We found out.
3917800	3918800	We found out.
3918800	3919800	We did it.
3919800	3920800	Yeah.
3920800	3921800	I was late.
3921800	3922800	Yeah.
3922800	3923800	I thought I was going to mash this all up because of that.
3923800	3924800	All right.
3924800	3925800	Oh, what's that?
3925800	3926800	What the heck?
3926800	3927800	Oh, it's a timer.
3928800	3929800	Oh.
3929800	3931800	Oh, we already lost that.
3931800	3932800	Yeah.
3932800	3933800	I think we got it.
3933800	3934800	Should we try that again?
3934800	3935800	Hold on.
3935800	3936800	Hold on.
3936800	3937800	Hold on.
3937800	3938800	Hold on.
3938800	3939800	OK.
3939800	3940800	So like when we're climbing, we got to try to jump as fast.
3940800	3941800	All right.
3941800	3942800	We'll try to shift.
3942800	3943800	We're going to use less time.
3943800	3944800	Yeah.
3944800	3945800	Actually, I think we can make that.
3945800	3947800	What is this?
3947800	3948800	OK.
3948800	3949800	I'm back.

3976800	3977800	Yeah.
3977800	3979800	It was hard to avoid the climbing animations.
3979800	3980800	Help.
3980800	3981800	Oh, my God.
3981800	3982800	That was scary.
3982800	3983800	Thanks, Queen.
3983800	3984800	We did it.

4474400	4475320	Oh, nice.
4475320	4478520	We're in a good spot.
4478520	4479520	Oh, my gosh.
4482520	4485000	I'm going to have lost my voice after this.
4485000	4486160	Same.
4486160	4486800	It's gone.
4486800	4489640	I have ASMR stream tomorrow, so I guess I'm just
4489640	4491400	going to have a horse voice.
4491400	4492400	Hi, everybody.
4496640	4498400	OK, ready?
4498400	4498680	I'm going.
4498680	4499400	I'm facing my fears.
4499400	4502600	And go!
4502600	4506920	Oh, you just missed that Apollo.
4506920	4509880	My space bar was like, it didn't click.
4509880	4510840	They almost panicked.
4513520	4514240	OK.
4514240	4517560	It's hard to see past these stupid bars.
4517560	4518040	You got it.
4518040	4518960	You got it.
4518960	4521240	Where are we going now?
4521240	4523880	Where are we going this way?
4523880	4524480	Oh, wait.
4524480	4525760	Are we not supposed to get off?
4525760	4528360	I don't think so.
4528360	4530360	We can go this way.
4530400	4534000	Yeah, I think this is an area you fall at.
4534000	4538880	Like, if you fall, you can land here in one of these areas.
4538880	4541080	Also, we weren't supposed to jump off.
4541080	4542440	OK, so we just jumped back off.
4542440	4543840	I think we went the wrong way.
4543840	4545160	OK.
4545160	4547760	Sorry, I have to go in that direction over there.
4547760	4549640	You got right there on our left.
4549640	4551200	OK, we're supposed to go over there.
4551200	4551800	OK, ready?
4551800	4552800	Yeah.
4552800	4553800	Oh.
4553800	4554640	I got on me.
4554640	4555640	Thank you so much for that.
4555640	4559040	I blame Apollo.
4559040	4559920	You can blame me.
4559960	4560960	It was all bait.
4560960	4562160	Thank you so much for the raid.
4566680	4568960	So nice weather we're having.
4568960	4572400	Yeah, gorgeous hellscape.
4572400	4573560	Oh, yeah, I love it.
4573560	4575400	I kind of like it.
4575400	4577920	It wouldn't be a hell unless we were chained together,
4577920	4578160	though.
4578160	4580880	If we were separate, it would be just a vacation home,
4580880	4581960	honestly.
4581960	4584760	So because we're chained together, it's hell.
4585400	4586400	Mm-hmm.
4589000	4590280	OK, don't.
4590280	4592320	Oh, I'm laughing too hard.
4592320	4593480	Sorry, that was me.
4596480	4598800	Right on it.
4598800	4599800	Oh, it's neat.
4599800	4601320	Where are we?
4601320	4602040	Oh, what is this?
4602040	4602600	What's this pit?
4602600	4603400	There's like a hole in there.
4603400	4604000	Go to the hole.
4604000	4605240	We find a secret spot.
4605240	4607000	Oh, that's the water where we were.
4610680	4612080	Hey, thank you so much for the raid.
4612080	4612480	Welcome.
4612480	4613880	Hell is my kind of place.
4613920	4616120	Yeah, we are playing.
4616120	4617600	Oh, Missouri is pulling us.
4617600	4620720	Beautiful ladies of Veilor and Apollo.
4620720	4622880	Hi.
4622880	4625400	I am from Mythos.
4625400	4626640	I am from Mythos.
4629040	4630720	OK.
4630720	4631880	Apollo, if we were.
4631880	4632640	I think it's the only up.
4632640	4635120	Sorry, it's called chained together.
4635120	4635960	That too.
4635960	4639960	If we were goddesses in Mythos, what would our goddess names
4639960	4640920	be?
4640920	4643320	Which Greek gods would it be?
4644320	4645320	Let's see.
4648320	4650320	Azora would be Aphrodite.
4650320	4652320	Oh, that's a good one.
4652320	4654320	Do we have to go over here?
4654320	4659320	Because she's just she's so freaking adorable.
4659320	4662320	I could see it like a shy Aphrodite be like.
4667320	4668320	Hey, we're fine.
4668320	4670320	We're fine.
4670320	4673320	I don't see this is good.
4673320	4674320	We got tossed up here.
4674320	4676320	Now we go back on it.
4676320	4677320	Three, two, one.
4680320	4681320	Too far.
4681320	4682320	Too far.
4682320	4684320	Yeah, we got to wait for the next one.
4688320	4689320	Don't we go?
4689320	4691320	Don't we go over there?
4691320	4692320	Looks like a point.
4692320	4693320	Over there.
4693320	4694320	OK, ready?
4694320	4695320	Ready?
4695320	4696320	Jump.
4696320	4699320	How did I not land on that?
4699320	4702320	OK, we got to go the opposite way over there, I believe.
4702320	4703320	Why not?
4703320	4704320	Where are we trying to go?
4704320	4705320	Right here?
4705320	4706320	Is that our jump?
4706320	4708320	I would say Aris from Aris.
4708320	4710320	Yeah, Aris would be cool.
4710320	4712320	I think Artemis for Frio would be cool.
4712320	4714320	You got jump on that.
4714320	4715320	Oh, shit.
4715320	4717320	We got to time it.
4717320	4719320	OK, count.
4719320	4720320	Three, two, one.
4720320	4721320	OK, ready?
4721320	4722320	Ready?
4722320	4723320	Jump.
4723320	4724320	Count.
4724320	4725320	Three, two, one.
4728320	4732320	OK, I don't know how that happened, but I did it.
4732320	4733320	This guy stopped moving.
4733320	4735320	Guy stopped moving.
4735320	4738320	I'm pulling, pulling, pulling, pulling, pulling, pulling.
4738320	4739320	I'm trying to stabilize.
4739320	4741320	OK, cool.
4741320	4744320	I'm going to get pulled off with a circle.
4744320	4745320	All right, we're good.
4745320	4746320	We good, we good.
4746320	4747320	OK.

4749320	4750320	OK, now don't kick that.
4750320	4751320	You're ready to go.
4751320	4752320	There it was.
4752320	4754320	We did it.
4754320	4755320	OK, OK, OK.
4755320	4757320	I got so discombobulated.
4757320	4759320	Where the heck are we?
4759320	4761320	Yeah, which way are we going?
4761320	4764320	Oh, my gosh, I saw a flaming man as.

5334380	5335380	Ready?
5335380	5336380	There's another one coming up, guys.

5338380	5339380	Go.
5339380	5340380	Oh, my God.
5340380	5343380	She just made that Apollo menu.
5343380	5346380	Here comes another one.
5346380	5347380	Oh, look.
5347380	5349380	Hey, closer, ladies.

5353380	5356380	Your guys' models are gone for me.
5356380	5357380	Apollo, you're gone.
5357380	5359380	Oh, Apollo just died.
5359380	5361380	Apollo, you're gone.
5361380	5362380	I'm dead.
5362380	5363380	I'm dead.
5363380	5364380	I'm dead.
5364380	5366380	Jump to freedom.
5366380	5367380	Damn.
5367380	5368380	All right.
5368380	5369380	Let's pause here.

5382380	5383380	Yeah.
5383380	5384380	I can't see you guys either.
5384380	5385380	I'm bad.
5385380	5387380	You might have crashed like I did.
5387380	5389380	Oh, connection system.
5389380	5390380	Okay.
5390380	5391380	Okay.
5391380	5393380	Ehe, ehe, ehe.
5393380	5394380	Hydrate time.
5394380	5395380	Good idea.
5395380	5396380	Good idea.
5396380	5399380	One by one, they're dying.
5399380	5400380	Damn.
5400380	5401380	We start my model.
5401380	5402380	Sheesh.
5402380	5406380	Oh, my gosh.
5406380	5409380	Remember to have encrustables.
5409380	5414380	Big stretch.
5414380	5424380	What is happening?
5424380	5426380	I'm sorry.
5426380	5428380	I just got, I just let it out.
5428380	5430380	I was like, oh my God.
5430380	5431380	I was cute.
5431380	5435380	And I ended up just like.
5435380	5437380	Sometimes you got a stretch.
5437380	5438380	It feels good.
5438380	5440380	Connection to steam servers failed.
5440380	5441380	Oh no.
5441380	5442380	That's what I got to.
5442380	5443380	I got that too.
5443380	5444380	I got that too.
5444380	5445380	I had to restart.
5445380	5447380	Oh, like to restart steam.
5447380	5449380	I did that already.
5449380	5451380	Oh, then yes.
5451380	5455380	I like horse clothes it on the end of your arm.
5455380	5456380	Oh, wait.
5456380	5458380	Oh, oh, it's connected.
5458380	5459380	It's connected.
5459380	5460380	Yeah.
5460380	5461380	Welcome, baby.
5461380	5463380	Let's see it.
5463380	5464380	Baby.
5464380	5467380	What the hell?
5467380	5469380	Who the fuck is that?
5469380	5476380	A ghost.
5476380	5479380	Ghosts just whispers in your ear.
5479380	5481380	Hey, baby.
5481380	5487380	How you doing, baby?
5487380	5490380	I'm taking a shit, baby.
5490380	5497380	Oh, fuck yeah.
5497380	5500380	That's the best feeling man.
5500380	5505380	Tell me more.
5505380	5510380	Hey, vengeful baby.
5510380	5513380	How you doing?
5513380	5515380	Steam saying a bunch of failures.
5515380	5516380	I'm done.
5516380	5519380	I'll talk like a really bad southern bed.
5519380	5524380	I'll talk like a really bad southern bell until Apollo gets back.
5524380	5525380	Did it say it failed?
5525380	5527380	It said that you rejoined.
5527380	5530380	I saw it.
5530380	5531380	Hello.
5531380	5533380	I'm here.
5533380	5536380	I was wondering if after all this years.
5536380	5538380	I was like me.
5538380	5541380	I was literally about to start singing that.
5541380	5545380	You took the words right out my mouth.
5545380	5548380	I was going to be so insulted by my southern accent.
5548380	5551380	I am.
5551380	5557380	She's fuming quietly.
5557380	5558380	Bonjourno.
5558380	5559380	Konichiwa.
5559380	5561380	Moshi moshi.
5561380	5571380	Are we got to go Zyma?
5571380	5574380	I'm carrying.
5574380	5576380	What the heck?
5576380	5581380	What the heck?
5581380	5583380	I can't see.
5583380	5585380	There we go.
5585380	5587380	Make it stop.
5587380	5589380	There we go.
5589380	5592380	You haven't loaded back in for me yet.
5592380	5594380	It's probably going to take a bit.
5594380	5596380	She's coming.
5596380	5598380	She came.
5598380	5600380	She's here.
5600380	5603380	Look at the musical notes.
5603380	5605380	They're animated.
5605380	5607380	All the mythos girls are.
5607380	5609380	Their outfits are also pretty animated.
5609380	5611380	I can control her guys.
5611380	5613380	Look.
5613380	5615380	Look at her feet.
5615380	5617380	Hold up.
5617380	5619380	I'm making myself big.
5619380	5622380	Those are actually some really nice feet.
5622380	5625380	They're not weird vtuber feet.
5625380	5628380	Some vtubers have weird ass feet.
5628380	5631380	You have nice feet.
5632380	5634380	Get stuffed on over here.
5634380	5636380	Get stuffed on over there.
5636380	5638380	I'll put you back.
5638380	5640380	I can't stop staring at these toes.
5640380	5642380	These are nice.
5652380	5654380	Oh my god.
5657380	5659380	My mods are going to yell at me later.
5659380	5661380	I'm so sorry.
5667380	5669380	The grapefruit.
5669380	5671380	That's why I learned that technique.
5671380	5673380	I learned the grapefruit technique.
5676380	5678380	Here we go.
5678380	5680380	We're back.
5680380	5682380	We're back at it again.
5682380	5684380	Back and better than ever.
5684380	5686380	I'm being pulled.
5686380	5688380	Let's go.
5689380	5691380	I'm coming.
5691380	5693380	She's coming.
5693380	5695380	Yeah?
5695380	5697380	I'm being pulled.
5697380	5699380	I'm being pulled to victory.
5699380	5701380	What just happened?
5701380	5704380	I saw the jump and I was like,
5704380	5706380	oh shit, I did the same.
5706380	5708380	Please.
5708380	5710380	Please.
5710380	5712380	Oh no.
5712380	5715380	We have to literally be super good at this man.
5716380	5719380	I'm going to kill myself in Minecraft.
5719380	5721380	In Minecraft?
5724380	5726380	They were talking about them dogs.
5726380	5728380	Yeah, I'm all fucking feed, man.
5728380	5730380	They're beautiful.
5730380	5732380	Them dogs are barking.
5732380	5734380	I got that dog in me.
5736380	5738380	My neighbors are probably like,
5738380	5740380	what the fuck is going on?
5740380	5743380	I'm sure they always think that.
5743380	5745380	Not just today.
5746380	5748380	Okay, I got it.
5748380	5750380	I'm ready.
5750380	5752380	I don't know.
5752380	5755380	Is chain together carrying my motion sickness right now?
5755380	5757380	Wait, whoa.
5759380	5761380	I'm trying.
5761380	5764380	I could have turned around to pull up.
5768380	5771380	Last time, your nieces and nephews were into that.
5771380	5773380	Damn bright they are.
5773380	5775380	Sweet home out, man.
5775380	5777380	Listen, I don't kink shame here.
5777380	5779380	You like feet, you like feet.
5779380	5781380	That's it.
5781380	5783380	I thought we were talking about
5783380	5785380	kissing sisters.
5789380	5791380	Are you from Mississippi?
5791380	5793380	Because you're the only miss who's pissed.
5793380	5795380	I'm sippy.
5795380	5797380	Okay, baby, I'll get a cup.
5797380	5799380	Give me some of that.
5800380	5802380	Is that how you piss?
5802380	5804380	You just make those noises?
5807380	5809380	Sorry, I fucked that up and jumped too early.
5809380	5811380	No, we're good, we're good.
5811380	5813380	We're good, I got you.
5813380	5815380	Yeah, lift me up.
5815380	5817380	Up you go.
5817380	5819380	You ready?
5821380	5823380	Okay, I'm doing it.
5823380	5826380	Are we all wearing the same pants?
5826380	5828380	Why do we have all the ripped
5828380	5830380	golden hole in our butt cheek?
5834380	5836380	Go slow.
5836380	5838380	I'm sprinting this.
5838380	5840380	No, no.
5840380	5842380	Slow and steady.
5842380	5844380	Easy tap, easy tap.
5844380	5846380	Easy clap, easy tap.
5846380	5848380	One at a time, jump.
5848380	5850380	One at a time.
5850380	5852380	Altogether?
5852380	5854380	I don't think so.
5854380	5856380	Okay, let's do it.
5856380	5858380	You don't have to jump.
5858380	5860380	You can just fall, by the way.
5860380	5862380	No, no, no.
5862380	5864380	Okay, okay.
5866380	5868380	It's very hard to pull her up
5868380	5870380	for some reason.
5870380	5872380	I have to be looking down at her.
5872380	5874380	Three, two, one.
5874380	5876380	Oops.
5876380	5878380	We made it, we made it, we made it.
5878380	5880380	Going without us, just go, just go.
5880380	5882380	Dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit.
5882380	5884380	Dammit, dammit, dammit.
5884380	5886380	Dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit.
5890380	5892380	Oh my god.
5892380	5894380	I'm just going to walk on to this.
5894380	5896380	I'm so tired.
5896380	5898380	Okay, good, okay, next.
5900380	5902380	Freak.
5902380	5904380	Oh shit, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
5904380	5906380	We got it, we got it, we got it.
5906380	5908380	Okay, okay, okay.
5908380	5910380	We're going, we're going.
5910380	5912380	Dammit, oh snap.
5912380	5914380	Yeah, we're so good, we're so good.
5914380	5916380	No, we're going.
5916380	5918380	Why do I keep fucking jumping?
5918380	5920380	That was so early.
5920380	5922380	Jump button to jump.
5922380	5924380	Okay, hold up, hold up, hold up.
5926380	5928380	Hold up, I got to fix him.
5928380	5930380	Ah!
5930380	5932380	It's fine, you're fine, you're fine.
5932380	5934380	We got this, we're going to carry you.
5934380	5936380	Oh no.
5936380	5938380	We've got you, we can carry you.
5938380	5940380	And Kat just hopped on my desk.
5940380	5942380	I jumped first, you jumped first.
5942380	5944380	I don't know what happened there.
5944380	5946380	I didn't see any of us touch it.
5946380	5948380	I forgot about the jump.
5948380	5950380	I forgot that it existed.
5950380	5952380	Where am I going?
5952380	5954380	Oh, where are we?
5954380	5958380	At the top of the water one again.
5960380	5962380	Okay, let's go.
5962380	5964380	Okay.
5972380	5974380	I didn't press the jump button.
5974380	5976380	You just jumped off.
5976380	5978380	I didn't press the jump button.
5980380	5982380	I just ran off.
5982380	5984380	We got this, we got this.
5984380	5986380	Oh, I got a piss.
5986380	5988380	I got a piss.
5990380	5992380	I'm looking at this guy's ass.
5994380	5996380	Some fiery ass.
5996380	5998380	Don't get distracted by the ass.
5998380	6000380	It's very hard not to.
6002380	6004380	That's Hell's ass right there.
6006380	6008380	Oh, we made it, we made it, we made it.
6008380	6010380	Did we?
6010380	6012380	Oh god.
6012380	6014380	Don't speak so soon.
6014380	6016380	Wait, wait, wait, wait.
6016380	6018380	Hang on, hang on, hang on.
6018380	6020380	Open up, Haram.
6024380	6026380	Is it just me?
6026380	6028380	Where did my sound go?
6028380	6030380	Oh no.
6030380	6032380	Your game sound?
6032380	6034380	Oh, it disappeared.
6034380	6036380	That's weird.
6036380	6038380	Why is Apollo so down?
6038380	6040380	Hold on.
6040380	6042380	I need to fix Apollo's head.
6042380	6044380	It's doing inappropriate things.
6046380	6048380	Alright, I brought her back up.
6048380	6050380	That's my default height.
6050380	6052380	Damn.
6052380	6054380	It's a tiny hill.
6054380	6056380	I'm tiny.
6056380	6058380	I'm in chibi form.
6058380	6060380	Oh, that makes more sense then.
6060380	6062380	Yeah.
6062380	6064380	Oh, I just, what the?
6064380	6066380	No, no, no.
6066380	6068380	No, no, no.
6068380	6070380	No, no, no.
6070380	6072380	No, not again.
6076380	6078380	Okay, I'm going last.
6078380	6080380	Okay.
6080380	6082380	Single file.
6082380	6084380	Single file line, let's go.
6084380	6086380	There's no stuff, we're reconnecting.
6086380	6088380	We're reconnecting, no worries.
6088380	6090380	Oh wait, what just happened?
6090380	6092380	Where'd everybody go?
6092380	6094380	Oh wait, did everybody go?
6094380	6096380	Yeah, everyone left me.
6096380	6098380	Alright, who cares?
6098380	6100380	I'm not going to fall.
6100380	6102380	I'm just putting my Fuji up.
6102380	6104380	Fuji.
6104380	6106380	Oh, that's the game.
6106380	6108380	I need...
6108380	6110380	Hello, thank you so much for following.
6110380	6112380	Oh, there's something apparently wrong with steam.
6112380	6114380	That makes sense then.
6114380	6118380	Why does it news to mess up while we are playing?
6118380	6120380	How dare they?
6120380	6122380	Believe.
6124380	6126380	You're all free now.
6126380	6128380	We're not free, we're not free.
6130380	6132380	Now I'm just going to be a muppet on your screen,
6132380	6134380	so I hope you guys like that.
6140380	6142380	Our meds ran out.
6142380	6144380	We're just doing it how we are.
6144380	6146380	Bye-bye to those leaving.
6146380	6148380	Bye.
6148380	6150380	I can give you a link.
6150380	6152380	It's a really quick setup.
6152380	6154380	You just download it.
6154380	6156380	Do you want it?
6156380	6158380	I can't download something right now.
6158380	6160380	We've got to play the game.
6162380	6164380	We have priorities.
6164380	6166380	That's playing the game.
6168380	6170380	How's the game going?
6170380	6172380	It's very...
6172380	6174380	It's very reminiscent of your name.
6180380	6182380	I'll be right back. I hear my cat outside.
6184380	6186380	Now let the cat in.
6186380	6188380	Let me check on my cat.
6188380	6190380	Oh, it's not my cat.
6190380	6192380	It's an outside cat that I like feeding every now and then.
6192380	6194380	And it cries whenever it wants food.
6194380	6196380	So I go out there.
6196380	6198380	I'll be right back.
6200380	6202380	That's so good.
6202380	6204380	What?
6206380	6208380	Here, I look for you.
6208380	6210380	I give this to you.
6210380	6212380	What's up lady?
6212380	6214380	What?
6214380	6216380	What?
6216380	6218380	What?
6218380	6220380	What?
6220380	6222380	What?
6222380	6224380	What?
6224380	6226380	What?
6226380	6228380	What?
6228380	6230380	What?
6230380	6232380	I can't just do pictures of everyone.
6232380	6234380	That might be easier. Let's see who I have.
6234380	6236380	It's pictured here.
6236380	6240380	You just use this and then it uses the picture.
6240380	6242060	I got a fark discord with you.
6243860	6245500	Is this the discord pictures?
6245500	6246340	Okay, okay.
6246340	6249100	Yeah, it's whatever we put in there.
6249100	6252820	It will use whatever we have to open it.
6252820	6254380	So you don't have to change anything
6254380	6256260	or add anything yourself.
6256260	6257900	It will always be in there.
6257900	6259420	How do I join with you?
6260780	6263980	You just copy the group one.
6263980	6266580	Group, got it, got it, got it, got it.
6267580	6270620	And then you just add it as browser source.
6270620	6272300	Oh my God, it says I have to be using
6272300	6276540	the discord desktop app and I don't do that.
6278300	6279500	I use it in my browser.
6279500	6281660	You do?
6281660	6284180	You use the discord browser?
6284180	6285140	What'd I do?
6285140	6286740	That's funny.
6286740	6288060	It's just what I do.
6289820	6291220	I can still try to use it.
6291220	6292740	I can still try to use it.
6293740	6295860	Does it still work though?
6295860	6296700	That's weird.
6312540	6313700	Is that gonna work?
6316180	6317620	I forgot I figured that out.
6317620	6319580	I stole this animation from Azura.
6323060	6323900	Oh.
6328260	6330300	What'd you steal from me?
6330300	6331140	Nothing.
6332180	6333460	We mean nothing.
6333460	6334700	What'd you steal from me?
6334700	6335660	What'd you over there looking at?
6335660	6336500	Nothing.
6337820	6339420	What'd you steal from me?
6339420	6340260	Mumble.
6341460	6344820	I just copied a certain animation.
6348180	6351020	I...
6351020	6353260	Um...
6357020	6359660	Yeah, this is not working.
6359660	6361300	This is not working for me.
6362540	6365140	Don't worry about it, we can still play.
6365140	6365980	Okay.
6369100	6370980	I give up, I couldn't figure it out.
6373540	6374380	Okay.
6374380	6376260	Maybe if I give you the link,
6376260	6379260	can you still use the browser link that I give you?
6379260	6380300	Oh, try it.
6380300	6381860	We can see if that works.
6385860	6388260	Yeah, that's what I tried and it doesn't work.
6388260	6390780	It just shows a loading thing forever.
6390780	6393100	I couldn't figure out the breath part though.
6395820	6400820	The breath part is animated by the person who made it.
6400820	6402540	Yeah, I know what you're doing.
6402540	6404300	I see you there.
6405300	6407660	You're naughty.
6407660	6409860	I won't keep my eyes on you.
6410860	6412060	Just throw the thumbnail in there.
6412060	6413060	Oh, that's a good idea.
6413060	6414380	That's a good idea.
6414380	6415220	You want it?
6417020	6418220	What the thumbnail?
6419740	6420940	You want it?
6420940	6421780	Don't...
6421780	6423340	Why are you saying it like that?
6426220	6427660	Yes, mommy, I want it so...
6427660	6429220	Mommy, please, mommy.
6431020	6431860	What?
6434300	6435140	No.
6443420	6444860	You're so lucky.
6444860	6447620	Why, why, why?
6447620	6449220	Why, uh...
6449220	6451460	Stam is not working.
6451460	6453620	And I'm not on your screen anymore.
6457020	6459540	I added a really fun toggle.
6461420	6462260	Oh, yeah.
6465300	6466340	I added a really fun toggle.
6466340	6467820	There, look, I've got everyone.
6467820	6469980	Perfect.
6469980	6473180	I need to make a toggle where I can take off my shabari ropes.
6480740	6482780	There, I've got everyone now.
6487060	6489020	You still thumbed out.
6489020	6490780	I loved it.
6490780	6491860	Yeah, there we go.
6491860	6493300	OK, I'm ready, I'm ready.
6495300	6496300	It's beautiful.
6499300	6500300	It's all of us.
6500300	6501300	Absolutely stunning.
6501300	6502300	Oh, I love it.
6502300	6506300	Oh, I also figured out, I have...
6506300	6507300	Where is it?
6507300	6509300	I have these eyes.
6509300	6511300	And I didn't even know I had them.
6514300	6516300	What do you mean you didn't know you had them?
6516300	6519300	It didn't show up in any of my toggles.
6519300	6523300	I was digging through the toggle files when I got my new tan toggle.
6524300	6528300	And I was like, oh, where did this come from?
6530300	6534300	I know a lot of them weren't set up as cue lines or even me.
6534300	6535300	Yeah.
6535300	6536300	Hello, I'm back.
6537300	6539300	All right, are we ready?
6539300	6540300	Yeah.
6540300	6541300	Yeah.
6545300	6547300	Yeah, I'm back, I'm back, I'm back.
6547300	6551300	Turns out, I thought it was one of the black cats, whiskers.
6551300	6552300	I named it whiskers.
6552300	6553300	But there's a new cat.
6553300	6556300	And I was like, oh, and she's so pretty.
6556300	6560300	I was like, oh my God, I want to call you Sapphire.
6561300	6564300	I'm basically now feeding nine cats.
6564300	6565300	Oh my gosh.
6567300	6568300	I'm a cat lady.
6569300	6570300	We love it though.
6571300	6573300	I aspire to be that level of cat lady.
6574300	6577300	My Lord Apollo, leshing guys.
6578300	6579300	I love cats, okay?
6580300	6581300	Where you going lady?
6581300	6582300	Yeah, it's this way.
6582300	6583300	Don't go that way.
6583300	6584300	She's like, let's go that way.
6584300	6585300	Where am I going?
6585300	6586300	Where am I going?
6586300	6587300	She'll go that way.
6587300	6588300	Oh, shit.
6588300	6589300	Oh, shit.
6589300	6590300	This way.
6590300	6591300	Is there, are you ready?
6591300	6592300	We're starting.
6592300	6593300	We're going, we're going.
6593300	6594300	She's not ready.
6594300	6595300	Stop.
6598300	6600300	Okay, ready, ready, ready, ready.
6600300	6601300	Oh, okay.
6602300	6603300	I'm very strong.
6607300	6609300	Finger action is on point.
6609300	6611300	Pinching forward.
6611300	6612300	Very carefully.
6612300	6613300	Okay.
6615300	6616300	Oh.
6623300	6624300	Just the, oh.
6627300	6628300	Oh my God.
6629300	6630300	Wait, what?
6631300	6632300	This is not it.
6633300	6635300	One at a time pulls the other's weight.
6635300	6637300	It makes a lot of noise.
6637300	6638300	Yeah.
6638300	6639300	Okay.
6641300	6642300	Oh my God.
6644300	6646300	This is what breaks us, huh?
6647300	6648300	Yeah.
6649300	6650300	So close to the checkpoint.
6650300	6652300	I'm completely mind broken at this point.
6652300	6654300	It's a part of the old cat lady.
6654300	6655300	Yes.
6664300	6665300	What the hell is that?
6665300	6667300	Is that you?
6669300	6670300	Oh.
6671300	6673300	Oh, I made it this time.
6673300	6674300	Yay.
6674300	6675300	Okay.
6675300	6676300	Nice.
6678300	6680300	I jump with one.
6683300	6684300	Oh.
6684300	6685300	Oh my gosh.
6685300	6686300	Oh my gosh.
6686300	6689300	Sometimes we may jump in like kind of different directions.
6689300	6690300	It will gank you.
6690300	6691300	So weird.
6691300	6692300	Yeah.
6692300	6694300	I mean, it's still kind of glitches through.
6694300	6695300	So that's, oh my God.
6695300	6696300	Yeah.
6696300	6698300	Is that you?
6698300	6700300	No, that's a circle.
6700300	6701300	Oh.
6703300	6705300	I would definitely make that noise though.
6705300	6706300	Okay.
6706300	6707300	Here we go.
6707300	6708300	Here we go.
6709300	6712300	Let's be careful and carefully make the jump.
6713300	6714300	Okay.
6714300	6715300	Careful jump.
6715300	6716300	Okay, ready?
6716300	6719300	One, two, three.
6721300	6723300	You guys can, you can just fall onto it.
6724300	6726300	I don't know for this one if you can do that though.
6726300	6728300	This one we can jump.
6728300	6730300	One, two, three.
6730300	6731300	Nope, you can't.
6734300	6735300	So I figured out you can't.
6748300	6749300	Okay.
6749300	6750300	Okay.
6751300	6753300	I feel like I'm playing Elden Ring.
6755300	6760300	I've been waiting this entire time for like a boss monster to come out and do this.
6761300	6763300	Totally depressed.
6763300	6765300	What is happening?
6765300	6768300	I tried to jump and it didn't jump.
6769300	6770300	Oh my God.
6771300	6774300	Oh, I was not paying attention at all.
6774300	6775300	Okay.
6776300	6779300	How could this happen to me?
6779300	6781300	How could this happen to me?
6781300	6784300	I remember seeing me when I said I was worried about you.
6784300	6785300	I remember seeing me.
6785300	6786300	What?
6786300	6787300	What are you saying?
6787300	6788300	What?
6788300	6790300	No, I didn't hear you.
6790300	6791300	What?
6791300	6796300	I said remember seeing me and I was worried about you and you're like, I shouldn't have been worried about you.
6796300	6797300	That wasn't even me.
6797300	6799300	That wasn't even me.
6800300	6802300	I'm letting you dangle there for that.
6802300	6804300	No, don't pull her up for it.
6804300	6805300	Whatever, I'm leaving.
6805300	6807300	I'll pull her up so she has to make the jump.
6811300	6814300	We were never making it past this point.
6817300	6819300	Where the fuck am I?
6822300	6824300	He just jumped off.
6824300	6825300	Oh, nice.
6828300	6829300	Thank you so much for the raid.
6829300	6830300	Welcome in.
6830300	6833300	Do the lighting change.
6847300	6849300	My cat is behind my monitor.
6849300	6851300	Reina, why have you betrayed me?
6855300	6857300	Okay, this time we've got it.
6857300	6858300	This is the one.
6858300	6859300	I am the one.
6861300	6865300	I didn't touch it.
6865300	6869300	I didn't touch it.
6870300	6873300	I'm killing myself.
6873300	6876300	I'm hanging myself right here.
6879300	6880300	Hello.
6880300	6884300	Hello and goodbye if you come and left or if you're just coming in.
6884300	6885300	Okay, ready?
6885300	6887300	Yeah, it's actually Reina this time.
6887300	6888300	Go.
6888300	6889300	Go, go, go.
6891300	6892300	Oh.
6895300	6896300	I can't slip and fall.
6896300	6897300	No.
6902300	6905300	You fucking suck.
6905300	6907300	How can you do that?
6907300	6910300	You can't slip and fall and I said it and boom.
6914300	6915300	It works.
6915300	6918300	I didn't see anybody land on that that time.
6918300	6919300	That was weird on my screen.
6919300	6921300	I think it's never good.
6921300	6923300	Never get up.
6923300	6924300	Never get up.
6924300	6925300	Never get up.
6925300	6928300	Speed run, speed run, speed run, speed run.
6928300	6930300	Speed run, speed run.
6932300	6934300	Okay, okay, okay, okay.
6934300	6935300	Perfect.
6935300	6936300	Look to the other side.
6936300	6937300	Look to the other side.
6937300	6938300	We got this.
6938300	6939300	We got this.
6939300	6940300	Hello, family.
6940300	6942300	You're not alone.
6942300	6943300	What?
6943300	6945300	Nobody jumped.
6945300	6947300	Nobody jumped.
6947300	6949300	I was like...
6952300	6954300	Oh, hey, we're fine.
6954300	6955300	Can I?
6955300	6958300	I mean, might as well just go to the checkpoint, man.
6958300	6960300	No, no, we don't from here.
6960300	6961300	We don't from here.
6961300	6963300	And then we go back on the one that we missed.
6965300	6966300	It's all right.
6966300	6967300	We're good.
6967300	6968300	We're good.
6968300	6969300	We're good.
6971300	6973300	I literally can't pull a Zer up unless I'm looking at her.
6973300	6974300	That's so weird.
6974300	6976300	So if I'm looking this way, I can't just pull.
6977300	6980300	I think you're supposed to be looking at them to pull them.
6980300	6981300	I had to...
6981300	6982300	Okay, ready?
6982300	6983300	Go!
6983300	6986300	Why did my space bar not work?
6987300	6989300	Oh, hey, we're back.
6990300	6991300	Never mind.
6993300	6994300	I'm a wizard.
6994300	6996300	I'm a wizard, guys.
6996300	6997300	Shit.
6997300	7001300	I wish to be a wizard right now and inhaling those fumes.
7002300	7003300	Go!
7007300	7010300	Okay, this is the last one and then I have to go.
7010300	7011300	Okay.
7011300	7014300	I can only do two hours, but this is the one we're going to make it.
7016300	7017300	We're making it.
7017300	7018300	We're making it.
7018300	7020300	We're making it for one.
7020300	7021300	I can feel it.
7023300	7024300	Perfect technique.
7024300	7025300	Beautiful.
7026300	7027300	Ready?
7027300	7028300	Ready?
7028300	7030300	And jump!
7031300	7032300	Ready?
7034300	7035300	I was too excited.
7035300	7036300	Thank you.
7037300	7039300	I'm locked in.
7044300	7045300	No.
7045300	7046300	Okay, okay, okay.
7047300	7048300	Look at that.
7048300	7051300	If I save right there, will it be saved?
7051300	7052300	No.
7052300	7054300	We're going to make the logs.
7054300	7055300	Damn.
7055300	7057300	Okay, yeah, we've got to make it to the next checkpoint.
7057300	7058300	We've got this.
7058300	7059300	I can't...
7059300	7060300	Oh, hello.
7060300	7061300	Thank you so much for the raid.
7061300	7062300	Hi.
7062300	7063300	Hello.
7065300	7066300	Hi.
7070300	7072300	Oh, my gosh.
7072300	7074300	Okay, this one you can just fall onto.
7074300	7075300	Okay.
7075300	7076300	Let's try.
7076300	7077300	I don't think so.
7077300	7078300	It's too far.
7078300	7079300	I think you have to do a jump.
7079300	7081300	Yeah, you can do a small jump.
7081300	7082300	Small jump.
7082300	7083300	Oh, no.
7083300	7084300	Okay, let me up.
7084300	7085300	Is there a...
7085300	7086300	Is there a...
7086300	7088300	It's because you pulled me down.
7088300	7090300	I didn't even fall.
7090300	7092300	What are you talking about?
7092300	7093300	Oh, so you do fall.
7093300	7094300	You do fall.
7094300	7095300	Okay.
7095300	7096300	You do fall.
7096300	7097300	You've got to fall.
7097300	7098300	You've got to fall.
7098300	7099300	Just fall and then climb.
7099300	7100300	Oh, my God.
7100300	7101300	Oh, me.
7101300	7102300	Okay.
7102300	7104300	So it is a fall thing.
7104300	7106300	It is a fall thing.
7107300	7109300	Okay, I think we figured it out.
7109300	7110300	We figured it out.
7110300	7112300	No more jumping when we get to the wood part.
7112300	7115300	You just fall and then climb.
7115300	7116300	Okay, one more.
7116300	7117300	This is it.
7117300	7118300	This is the one.
7118300	7119300	No.
7119300	7120300	I'm killing us all.
7120300	7121300	Come with me.
7121300	7122300	No.
7122300	7123300	Come on.
7123300	7124300	Death.
7124300	7125300	Here we go.
7125300	7126300	Death.
7126300	7127300	I'm sorry to follow.
7127300	7128300	Goodbye.
7128300	7129300	No.
7129300	7133300	How are you able to pull us all up the one time?
7133300	7137300	We're trying to kill ourselves, but then when we're trying to stay on, we all fall.
7137300	7138300	I have no idea.
7138300	7142300	I think it's because I'm on a flat platform and it's long enough.
7142300	7143300	Oh, that makes sense.
7143300	7144300	Hey, make a triangle.
7144300	7146300	This game is terrible.
7148300	7149300	Okay.
7149300	7150300	This is it.
7150300	7151300	This is the last one.
7151300	7152300	This is it.
7152300	7153300	This is the last one.
7153300	7154300	Okay.
7154300	7156300	We're almost at the two hour mark.
7156300	7158300	Oh, my God.
7158300	7160300	It fell.
7160300	7162300	Do not fall.
7162300	7163300	We got this.
7163300	7164300	We got this.
7164300	7165300	We got this.
7165300	7167300	Here we go.
7167300	7168300	Perfect.
7168300	7169300	Oh, we're amazing.
7169300	7170300	Okay.
7170300	7171300	Okay.
7171300	7172300	Okay.
7172300	7173300	Okay.
7173300	7175300	Ready and jump.
7175300	7177300	Oh, my God.
7177300	7178300	Okay.
7178300	7179300	Okay.
7179300	7180300	Okay.
7180300	7181300	He saved me.
7181300	7182300	He saved me.
7182300	7183300	I got too pale.
7183300	7184300	I got too orange.
7184300	7185300	Okay.
7185300	7186300	Over here.
7186300	7188300	And jump this way.
7188300	7189300	Okay.
7189300	7194300	We made it.
7194300	7195300	Yeah.
7195300	7196300	Apollo.
7196300	7197300	Hello.
7197300	7198300	Okay.
7198300	7199300	Okay.
7199300	7200300	No, chunky wide.
7200300	7201300	Yay.
7201300	7202300	Okay.
7202300	7205300	Jump on the first one and just fall on the second.
7205300	7206300	Okay.
7206300	7207300	I thought it was fall.
7207300	7209300	Fall on the first one and jump on both of them.
7209300	7210300	Both of them.
7210300	7211300	I did fall.
7211300	7212300	Okay.
7212300	7213300	You can just fall.
7213300	7214300	Okay.
7214300	7215300	Yeah.
7215300	7216300	You want to fall.
7216300	7217300	Okay.
7217300	7218300	I'm backing up.
7218300	7219300	Shit.
7219300	7221300	I couldn't make it back to the platform.
7221300	7223300	I was trying to back up to the platform.
7223300	7224300	Okay.
7224300	7229300	I don't know why I fell and then I clicked like space bar to climb up.
7229300	7230300	God.
7230300	7231300	Okay.
7231300	7232300	That was not the one.
7232300	7233300	That was not the one.
7233300	7234300	I'm killing us.
7234300	7235300	Damn it.
7235300	7236300	I'm killing us.
7236300	7237300	Come here.
7237300	7238300	No, we're killing us.
7238300	7239300	It's over.
7239300	7240300	It's done.
7240300	7241300	It's over.
7241300	7242300	It's over.
7242300	7243300	It's over.
7243300	7244300	It's over.
7244300	7245300	It's over.
7245300	7246300	It's over.
7246300	7247300	It's over.
7247300	7248300	It's over.
7248300	7249300	It's over.
7249300	7250300	It's over.
7250300	7251300	It's over.
7251300	7252300	It's over.
7252300	7253300	It's over.
7253300	7254300	It's over.
7254300	7255300	It's over.
7255300	7256300	It's over.
7256300	7257300	It's over.
7257300	7258300	It's over.
7258300	7259300	It's over.
7259300	7260300	It's over.
7260300	7261300	That's happening here.
7261300	7262300	It's a game.
7262300	7263300	We can end here.
7263300	7264300	We can end here.
7264300	7265300	Okay.
7265300	7267300	Thank you so much for having me, guys.
7267300	7268300	I had so much fun
7268300	7269300	and I lost so much sanity.
7269300	7270300	I don't ever want to play this game again.
7270300	7271300	I did have a lot of fun.
7271300	7272300	This.
7272300	7273300	This was fun.
7273300	7274300	Oh, this was good.
7274300	7275300	I'm out of lunch, mom.
7275300	7276300	I didn't play this as straw.
7276300	7277300	This would be fun to play as straw.
7277300	7278300	They're her Scottish rage.
7278300	7279300	Good luck.
7279300	7280300	Good luck.
7280300	7283540	take bets on who's gonna throw up first when you're playing this when you're
7283540	7289140	drunk. Oh my god. Azora, I'm putting my bets on you.
7289140	7292300	Well, me. I'm gonna play with you first.
7295300	7297300	Yeah, I think so. How are we dying?
7297300	7299300	Yes, damn it.
7299300	7301300	You're slowly trying to kill us, sir.
7301300	7304300	No.
7304300	7307300	Let me die. Let me die.
7307300	7310300	I'm ending it. Why am I on top of that?
7310300	7312300	Thank you.
7322300	7325300	Oh, now they want to die. No, I'm not letting it happen.
7325300	7327300	I'm not letting this happen.
7327300	7330300	No, I get to die in our own terms.
7330300	7333300	It's my terms we get to die on.
7338300	7340300	Wee.
7345300	7348300	Wee. This is actually nice.
7348300	7350300	This is pretty nice.
7352300	7355300	Oh, fuck. Get me out of here. Get me out of here.
7355300	7357300	Get me out of here. Get me out of here.
7357300	7359300	Get me out of here.
7361300	7363300	Oh my god. I'm leaving.
7363300	7365300	Leaving the game.
7366300	7368300	Get me out of here.
7369300	7371300	I'm still on the call.
7372300	7375300	Why am I all the way down here?
7382300	7385300	Let me turn that down a little bit.
7385300	7387300	Hey.
7388300	7391300	Did you guys enjoy?
7395300	7398300	That was fun. I actually like that game a lot.
7398300	7401300	I definitely want to play it with Stradi.
7401300	7404300	It was going to be so funny. I miss you guys too.
7404300	7406300	I miss you guys so much.
7406300	7409300	Did you guys like my little surprise?
7409300	7411300	Yeah, blue.
7411300	7413300	Yeah, blue.
7413300	7416300	Did you guys like my little surprise?
7416300	7418300	Yeah, blue.
7418300	7421300	And then you got tan toggle.
7421300	7424300	Although I kind of go blackface for a second.
7424300	7427300	Sometimes it happens. Sometimes it doesn't.
7432300	7434300	Yeah, see that time I didn't do it.
7434300	7436300	It's funny.
7436300	7438300	I locked my true form.
7438300	7440300	Yeah, I'll be honest with you.
7440300	7442300	So normally it looks like this
7442300	7444300	and I don't like the colors
7444300	7446300	because I just look like a red orc.
7446300	7448300	So I fixed it myself.
7448300	7450300	I'm like, this isn't tan. This is red.
7450300	7452300	But it colored my ears the way I wanted.
7452300	7454300	So because I'm...
7455300	7457300	This looks like I have a sunburn.
7458300	7460300	Yeah, it looks so red.
7460300	7462300	So I asked for less red undertones.
7462300	7464300	But I was just like, whatever, I'll do it myself.
7465300	7467300	I'll do it myself.
7468300	7470300	And then I have my cover up coming.
7470300	7472300	I actually like it with the red eyes.
7472300	7474300	I thought I would like it with the blue eyes more.
7474300	7476300	But I like it with the red eyes.
7480300	7482300	Now we just need tan lines.
7482300	7484300	Oh yeah, where all my shabari is.
7484300	7486300	I could actually probably do that
7486300	7488300	and make my shabari...
7488300	7490300	Like initially my shabari was lighter.
7490300	7492300	The shadows because of the underlying part of the model.
7492300	7494300	I don't know if you guys noticed,
7494300	7496300	my hair color changes too.
7496300	7498300	And I change the toggle.
7498300	7500300	My hair gets lighter.
7501300	7502300	Because it looks...
7502300	7504300	I think it looks a little bit better
7504300	7506300	with lighter blonde hair.
7506300	7508300	I'm a sucker for white hair and dark skin.
7508300	7510300	I'll be honest with you.
7510300	7512300	Although this is a little bit darker than I am.
7512300	7513300	But I like...
7513300	7515300	I probably would be more of a Zura's color
7515300	7517300	and then she would be more of my color.
7517300	7519300	But you know, we can always figure that out.
7522300	7524300	Strawberry blond.
7524300	7526300	Look at that, I just dye my hair.
7528300	7530300	That's Madam Secret.
7530300	7532300	I dye my hair...
7532300	7534300	red at the ends.
7535300	7537300	Don't tell anyone.
7538300	7541300	I'm naturally just normally blonde.
7542300	7545300	I'm a freaking Valyrian from House of the Dragon.
7545300	7547300	But let's talk.
7547300	7549300	How are you guys doing?
7549300	7551300	How are you guys feeling?
7551300	7553300	Let me look at my donos and stuff.
7553300	7555300	I wanted to give you guys more attention
7555300	7557300	for my first stream back.
7557300	7559300	But I wasn't able to do that.
7559300	7561300	So I apologize.
7561300	7563300	Let's see.
7563300	7565300	Thank you guys for all the remembers.
7565300	7567300	That's so nice.
7567300	7569300	I saw it like this.
7569300	7571300	I figured out what we're doing
7571300	7573300	for the monthly.
7573300	7575300	I'm not telling you yet.
7575300	7577300	Hee hee hee.
7579300	7581300	Thank you Grumbo for the $50 tip.
7581300	7583300	I can't stay for your return stream.
7583300	7585300	Take this and feel better.
7585300	7587300	That sounds so bad.
7587300	7589300	Take my money.
7589300	7591300	Feel better.
7591300	7593300	I actually feel...
7593300	7595300	Somebody in my Twitter comments recommended
7595300	7597300	this thing called Vertagon.
7597300	7599300	That they said that they're family member use.
7599300	7601300	So I'm like fuck it.
7601300	7603300	And I bought it on Amazon.
7603300	7605300	And it's actually really good.
7605300	7607300	I feel a lot better after only taking one pill.
7607300	7609300	It's like a little supplement.
7609300	7611300	I was falling over myself
7611300	7613300	at the grocery store with my mom.
7613300	7615300	She had to study me a couple of times.
7615300	7617300	I keep making myself bigger.
7617300	7619300	Thank you for the remembers.
7619300	7621300	I'm going to call them remembers.
7621300	7623300	Reherums.
7623300	7625300	R-X-S-E-J.
7625300	7627300	Thank you Mr. Black.
7627300	7629300	Silence. Appreciate you guys.
7629300	7631300	I miss you guys a lot.
7631300	7633300	Let me...
7633300	7635300	What the heck's going on in my stream?
7635300	7637300	It's like showing me stuff from like five minutes ago.
7639300	7641300	You look amazing as always.
7641300	7643300	Thank you darling.
7643300	7645300	Thank you.
7645300	7647300	Yeah, I don't know if...
7647300	7649300	I wonder if people
7649300	7651300	will be mad that I'm brown
7651300	7653300	or like...
7653300	7655300	Although it's funny because when I do my toggles
7655300	7657300	I forgot...
7669300	7671300	So that's top audio was muted.
7671300	7673300	But oh my goodness.
7673300	7675300	What the hell?
7675300	7677300	Um...
7677300	7679300	Uh...
7679300	7681300	Thank you Doki.
7681300	7683300	For the two hundo.
7683300	7685300	That was...
7685300	7687300	I didn't expect that.
7687300	7689300	Why are you guys so nice to me?
7689300	7691300	I don't understand.
7691300	7693300	I don't deserve this.
7693300	7695300	Stop!
7695300	7697300	I'm tired.
7697300	7699300	Don't give me your money.
7699300	7701300	Oh...
7701300	7703300	I miss my hundo so much.
7703300	7705300	Toggle is beautiful.
7705300	7707300	I'm so happy to see you streaming it.
7707300	7709300	I know. I'm so glad to be back.
7709300	7711300	I was dying.
7711300	7713300	I was going to stream again this morning.
7713300	7715300	Um...
7715300	7717300	Just for us.
7717300	7719300	My mom was like, oh, let's take you to the grocery store.
7719300	7721300	So I like...
7721300	7723300	Didn't do that. And then my mom's like, oh, I'm going to be late.
7723300	7725300	And I'm like, great.
7725300	7727300	I'm just strafing mom.
7727300	7729300	What the hell, mother?
7729300	7731300	Um...
7731300	7733300	But she says hi. She says...
7733300	7735300	She's very thankful you guys have been taking care of me.
7735300	7737300	Because I was telling you guys...
7737300	7739300	Telling her about that you guys got me like...
7739300	7741300	So my mom's like, oh, do you need any like...
7741300	7743300	Um...
7743300	7745300	Gatorade? I'm like, sorry.
7745300	7747300	They bought me PDLI.
7747300	7749300	And my mom's like, oh, do you need this?
7749300	7751300	I'm like, oh, they bought me curtains.
7751300	7753300	She's like, what the hell?
7753300	7755300	And I'm like, I don't...
7755300	7757300	I don't know what they do to deserve it.
7757300	7759300	They're just so kind to me.
7759300	7761300	And I love it. And I appreciate it.
7761300	7763300	Yeah, I got some groceries.
7763300	7765300	I spent quite a bit of change on groceries.
7765300	7767300	But...
7767300	7769300	Definitely I hadn't gone grocery shopping in like...
7769300	7771300	Two months.
7771300	7773300	I would get...
7773300	7775300	A few things here or there.
7775300	7777300	But I just never like actually went full on grocery shopping.
7777300	7779300	I got a crustables.
7779300	7781300	Although I forgot to...
7781300	7785300	Get some things. So I need to run to the store tomorrow, probably.
7785300	7787300	She didn't even pay for it, literally.
7787300	7789300	I was just like talking to her.
7789300	7791300	I'm like, yeah, I finally got the um...
7791300	7793300	Little set for the balcony that I wanted.
7793300	7795300	The patio set.
7795300	7797300	My mom's like, oh, that's nice.
7797300	7799300	And I'm like, oh, yeah, harem got that for me.
7799300	7801300	And she's just like...
7801300	7803300	What?
7803300	7805300	And I'm like, yeah, she's like...
7805300	7807300	Cheebie, that was a lot of money.
7807300	7809300	And I'm like, I don't know what the...
7809300	7811300	She's like...
7811300	7813300	Are you sure it's only audio you're doing?
7813300	7815300	I'm like, mom.
7815300	7817300	I'm only doing audio.
7819300	7821300	Incrustables tier list stream?
7821300	7823300	Oh, yeah, I should probably do that.
7823300	7825300	That'd be a good idea.
7825300	7827300	Whoo!
7827300	7829300	So eepy.
7829300	7831300	Although I slept a couple of times today,
7831300	7833300	but I was kind of off and on...
7833300	7835300	A week since...
7835300	7837300	What's it called?
7837300	7839300	What's it called?
7839300	7841300	Since this morning.
7841300	7843300	Let me fix my freaking eyeballs.
7843300	7845300	But thank you so much, Doki.
7845300	7847300	Does Mama Cotton Bomb want anything?
7847300	7849300	Mama Cotton...
7849300	7851300	I was gonna buy her...
7851300	7853300	Because she got some groceries too while she was with me.
7853300	7855300	And I was gonna buy her groceries for her.
7855300	7857300	My mom is a very proud woman
7857300	7859300	and she doesn't like taking things.
7859300	7861300	And she's just like...
7861300	7863300	I feel weird you buying my groceries,
7863300	7865300	so I'm buying for my own.
7865300	7867300	You literally don't have a job right now,
7867300	7869300	and you've taken care of me my entire life,
7869300	7871300	so let me just take care of you.
7871300	7873300	And she's still refused.
7873300	7875300	Um...
7875300	7877300	My dad...
7877300	7879300	My mom, like, ridiculed my dad
7879300	7881300	because she's just like, well, you know how your dad is.
7881300	7883300	He's always asking you to buy him takeout
7883300	7885300	and get him that expensive bourbon.
7885300	7887300	She's like, that's fine.
7887300	7889300	And I'm like, oh my god.
7889300	7891300	She's...
7891300	7893300	My mom's just not like that.
7893300	7895300	She's worked hard for everything,
7895300	7897300	so she's very proud like that.
7897300	7899300	That's... I aim to be just like her.
7899300	7901300	And my dad's like, oh!
7901300	7903300	My dad calls you my minions.
7903300	7905300	He's like,
7905300	7907300	so your minions get the hook up?
7907300	7909300	Can they get me that bourbon?
7909300	7911300	I'm like, dad, that bourbon was $2,000.
7911300	7913300	I finally looked at the price.
7913300	7915300	I didn't look up the price before,
7915300	7917300	and I'm like, you wanted my people
7917300	7919300	to buy a $2,000 bottle for you?
7919300	7921300	No!
7921300	7923300	That's just so fine!
7923300	7925300	He's like, I don't know.
7925300	7927300	I didn't know the type of money you were making.
7927300	7929300	I don't know. I don't know.
7929300	7931300	And I'm like, dad.
7931300	7933300	No, I'm not going to ask them to do that.
7933300	7935300	I'm like, you haven't even come on the stream yet
7935300	7937300	and you expect them to catch you.
7937300	7939300	He's like, okay, you're right.
7943300	7945300	I'm doing okay.
7945300	7947300	I'm still a little dizzy.
7947300	7949300	Actually, that stream wasn't as bad as I thought it would be
7949300	7951300	in terms of my dizziness.
7951300	7953300	But I woke up fine this morning
7953300	7955300	and I'm like, oh, yeah, it's probably gone.
7955300	7957300	And then as I kind of move throughout the day,
7957300	7959300	if I move too much,
7959300	7961300	if I move my head, I get dizzy.
7961300	7963300	So I think because I'm just moving my eyes
7963300	7965300	and I'm not moving my head,
7965300	7967300	because I'm not turning my head to look at the screen,
7967300	7969300	I'm just using my eyes,
7969300	7971300	then it makes it a lot easier.
7971300	7973300	Although, when I was doing this
7973300	7975300	as a joke a couple of times,
7975300	7977300	I was like, whoa!
7977300	7979300	How's Fia doing?
7979300	7981300	So it seems like Fia has...
7981300	7983300	So if you don't know, let me explain
7983300	7985300	what's going on with Fia.
7985300	7987300	So Fia is my cat.
7987300	7989300	She is a little over a year old.
7989300	7991300	She's like a year and a month or two.
7991300	7993300	She is my female...
7993300	7995300	One of my female classmates cat.
7995300	7997300	She's adorable.
7997300	7999300	This past March,
7999300	8001300	randomly,
8001300	8003300	I was...
8003300	8005300	This has happened during my PL
8005300	8007300	my past life,
8007300	8009300	as Rina.
8009300	8011300	She
8011300	8013300	randomly,
8013300	8015300	the day of one of my
8015300	8017300	birthday event,
8017300	8019300	she randomly couldn't walk,
8019300	8021300	so I had to cancel it.
8021300	8023300	And I was wondering,
8023300	8025300	she was plopping her feet
8025300	8027300	and she couldn't pick up her back legs.
8027300	8029300	So we literally did
8029300	8031300	so many X-rays and scans
8031300	8033300	and ultrasounds.
8033300	8035300	I don't know if she had a surgery
8035300	8037300	or if she had a neurological issue.
8037300	8039300	No, she's totally fine.
8039300	8041300	They literally couldn't find anything wrong with her.
8041300	8043300	They have no idea. They did blood work.
8043300	8045300	All her blood work came back normal.
8045300	8047300	But she couldn't walk.
8047300	8049300	She couldn't move her back legs.
8049300	8051300	And then eventually it became her front legs.
8051300	8053300	And then she couldn't move her body or her tail.
8053300	8055300	So she was literally just paralyzed.
8055300	8057300	And I had to bring her to the bathroom.
8057300	8059300	There's like a clip someone took of me.
8059300	8061300	And I'm like, sorry,
8061300	8063300	so she can shit because she couldn't posture.
8065300	8067300	And I would carry...
8067300	8069300	Fiya's very good at communicating.
8069300	8071300	So she has a little bed that I would put her in
8071300	8073300	and I would just carry her around the bed
8073300	8075300	and I'd bring over her litter box.
8075300	8077300	She meow, no.
8077300	8079300	Or I'd bring her over to the food and she wouldn't meow.
8079300	8081300	So that means I just set her down so she wants to eat.
8081300	8083300	So she was very good at telling me what she wanted.
8083300	8085300	I gave her medication every day.
8085300	8087300	She was on three different medications.
8087300	8089300	And finally,
8089300	8091300	when she got her on an antibiotic,
8091300	8093300	she saw a plethora of doctors,
8093300	8095300	thousands of dollars in vet bills
8095300	8097300	that I'm still trying to pay off.
8099300	8101300	Yes, for a month,
8101300	8103300	almost three months,
8103300	8105300	I was literally waiting on her hand and foot.
8105300	8107300	I was another reason why I went on a mental leave
8107300	8109300	because I couldn't take the toll
8109300	8111300	because she hadn't even turned a year yet
8111300	8113300	and I thought I was going to have to put my cat down.
8113300	8115300	So it was really tough.
8115300	8117300	And I love her to death.
8117300	8119300	I just want her to fucking live to her first year.
8119300	8121300	That's all I want.
8121300	8123300	And then when I was
8123300	8125300	accepted to be a lawyer, I literally was like,
8125300	8127300	oh my god, thank you fucking,
8127300	8129300	thank you universe for this.
8129300	8131300	And then,
8131300	8133300	Stroni was just like, I'll pay for stuff.
8133300	8135300	I'll do this, I'll do that.
8135300	8137300	I was like, nah, but she did help me
8137300	8139300	with a bill.
8139300	8141300	So I've already paid her back.
8141300	8143300	But I was just very appreciative
8143300	8145300	of that.
8145300	8147300	And it's happening again.
8147300	8149300	She can't move her back legs.
8149300	8151300	So her body is slowly just
8151300	8153300	not being able to
8153300	8155300	support her.
8155300	8157300	So she can't walk.
8157300	8159300	She'll try, she'll like kind of drag herself
8159300	8161300	towards me
8161300	8163300	because she wants to be picked up.
8163300	8165300	That's why I get the big stretch
8165300	8167300	because I would have to do physical therapy
8167300	8169300	because her muscles started to atrophy
8169300	8171300	because she didn't move for like a month and a half.
8171300	8173300	And she was so small
8173300	8175300	and so tiny.
8175300	8177300	I generally didn't think that she was going to make it.
8177300	8179300	But she did.
8179300	8181300	She got around these antibiotics
8181300	8183300	because one doctor was like, oh, maybe she
8183300	8185300	has this. I don't fucking know.
8185300	8187300	And so we just threw shit at the wall
8187300	8189300	and hope that it sticks.
8189300	8191300	And it did. So I am hoping
8191300	8193300	that
8193300	8195300	the antibiotics help her again.
8195300	8197300	I don't know if she has some sort of viral thing
8197300	8199300	that just like makes her shut down
8199300	8201300	her ability to,
8201300	8203300	I don't know any virus like that.
8203300	8205300	The doctor said it could be toxoplasmosis
8205300	8207300	which is why they have
8207300	8209300	women who are pregnant
8209300	8211300	not scoop litter boxes because
8211300	8213300	humans can get it and like it's very
8213300	8215300	dangerous.
8215300	8217300	So I think
8217300	8219300	they like they have no idea but they're like
8219300	8221300	maybe she has that but they tested her
8221300	8223300	for it and it didn't really come back for anything.
8223300	8225300	But hey, it worked so
8225300	8227300	we don't really care.
8227300	8229300	So I already started her in the meds.
8229300	8231300	The doctor and like
8231300	8233300	I emailed her like in like 5am
8233300	8235300	because I woke up because I just have
8235300	8237300	like a fucking sixth sense about those
8237300	8239300	things. And I noticed
8239300	8241300	that Fia like was just
8241300	8243300	stuck under the bed and that's where she is
8243300	8245300	now but she's on the edge
8245300	8247300	so I can pull her out if I can like bring her
8247300	8249300	to the litter box or bring her to the
8249300	8251300	thing.
8251300	8253300	But yeah, I'm very
8253300	8255300	and that's why I have that crate is
8255300	8257300	because I would have to crater when I left
8257300	8259300	when I had to go to work or anything
8259300	8261300	but I essentially
8261300	8263300	was literally just being her caretaker
8263300	8265300	around the clock.
8265300	8267300	How long does it take for the meds to kick in? I have no idea.
8267300	8269300	No clue.
8269300	8271300	But I'm hoping it's soon.
8271300	8273300	All I know is that
8273300	8275300	she can be fixed, that she can be
8275300	8277300	okay, that it is something
8277300	8279300	that must flare up every once in a while.
8279300	8281300	I'm thinking it might have happened
8281300	8283300	because she was stressed that I was gone
8283300	8285300	is my guess.
8285300	8287300	Or I don't know if
8287300	8289300	like
8289300	8291300	my mom's like maybe like boomie
8291300	8293300	like passes something along
8293300	8295300	to her and like all the other cats are immune
8295300	8297300	but Fia and I'm like maybe she just
8297300	8299300	like I'm pretty sure like Fia is just like immune
8299300	8301300	no deficient.
8301300	8303300	The foster mom
8303300	8305300	because I rescued Fia from the south
8305300	8307300	from like Mississippi so that's
8307300	8309300	why I get that Mississippi joke a lot.
8311300	8313300	I'm getting dizzy a little bit.
8313300	8315300	She said her sister
8315300	8317300	passed away from complications
8317300	8319300	because she couldn't move and so I'm wondering
8319300	8321300	if it's like a congenital thing
8321300	8323300	or she was born with this condition.
8323300	8325300	But yeah.
8325300	8327300	But I gave
8327300	8329300	her all the vet
8329300	8331300	minus the vet pills because
8331300	8333300	again you guys know how much I fucking
8333300	8335300	know in vet pills. It's a lot.
8339300	8341300	The vet like was literally
8341300	8343300	what I like with the vet is she tried to
8343300	8345300	cut corners for prices
8345300	8347300	where she could. She like reduced a lot of pricing
8347300	8349300	for me because she knew it was like really
8349300	8351300	like again like thousands and thousands
8351300	8353300	of dollars just to try to save my cat
8355300	8357300	and
8357300	8359300	yeah I'm wondering
8359300	8361300	if like the stress of me being gone
8361300	8363300	triggered it
8363300	8365300	or something else or like
8365300	8367300	my mom was cleaning the litter box while I was gone
8367300	8369300	so like the litter boxes weren't dirty
8369300	8371300	so there couldn't be like a bacterial infection.
8371300	8373300	They literally don't know
8373300	8375300	it's not they don't think it's by food
8375300	8377300	she doesn't seem allergic to anything.
8377300	8379300	So many tests so much stuff.
8379300	8381300	I'm sorry to dump that all on you
8381300	8383300	but I just want to give you context
8383300	8385300	as to kind of what I'm dealing with
8385300	8387300	and I have been dealing with since March
8387300	8389300	I'm just I am just
8389300	8391300	thankful that
8391300	8393300	it can be sorted and that she can
8393300	8395300	be fine and she can play and she can run
8395300	8397300	and she can jump
8399300	8401300	eventually and so I'm just gonna
8401300	8403300	wait for that to happen
8403300	8405300	I'm gonna hope that the antibiotics work
8405300	8407300	and if not there are two other medications
8407300	8409300	she was on that will probably all bring them all
8409300	8411300	into rotation again
8411300	8413300	I'm just gonna tackle it. I will fight for Fia
8413300	8415300	she is my baby
8415300	8417300	she is my she
8417300	8419300	was with Reina when Reina was sick. I still have to bring Reina
8419300	8421300	to the vet because they're like oh yeah Reina might have cancer
8421300	8423300	and I'm like fucking
8423300	8425300	great like come on
8425300	8427300	stop and then I'm motion sick and I can't even
8427300	8429300	bring my cat to the vet
8429300	8431300	I still think
8431300	8433300	when my mom drove me today to get her meds
8433300	8435300	um
8435300	8437300	yeah it's just really
8437300	8439300	shitty because my cats are my life they're all I have
8439300	8441300	besides you guys and my family
8441300	8443300	it just sucks
8443300	8445300	Reina I'm kind of
8445300	8447300	may peace with because she's 14
8447300	8449300	she already has a lot of health issues
8449300	8451300	she's got kidney disease she's in my arms
8451300	8453300	right now purring
8453300	8455300	um
8455300	8457300	why did you get sick all of a sudden and I think it was from traveling
8457300	8459300	my mom was
8459300	8461300	wondering if I got oh I have to tell you guys
8461300	8463300	what happened I didn't tell you guys what happened
8463300	8465300	to me I'm so sorry that I'm kind of just dumping
8465300	8467300	this on you but
8467300	8469300	uh I haven't seen my therapist yet
8469300	8471300	so I'm just gonna tell you guys instead
8471300	8473300	um
8473300	8475300	yeah Reina's
8475300	8477300	being a cutie on my lap I have to bring Reina
8477300	8479300	to the vet to get her calcium check
8479300	8481300	she either has a thyroid issue or she is cancer
8481300	8483300	you better not have fucking cancer
8483300	8485300	or I'll be pissed
8485300	8487300	if she has cancer
8487300	8489300	I don't think she would be able to survive treatment
8489300	8491300	so I don't want to put her through that
8491300	8493300	we'll see
8493300	8495300	um she's she was playing and running around
8495300	8497300	today so I honestly
8497300	8499300	she was eating a lot
8499300	8501300	so I'm wondering if um this is like a
8501300	8503300	thyroid issue because that just makes
8503300	8505300	way more sense to me because it's
8505300	8507300	just makes more sense with what else
8507300	8509300	she's going on um
8509300	8511300	I know literally
8511300	8513300	the house and everything goes wrong uh
8513300	8515300	and
8515300	8517300	my mom said she noticed it
8517300	8519300	that Fia was acting weird
8519300	8521300	when my mom first came to visit she was checking
8521300	8523300	on her she says she was very
8523300	8525300	my cats are very friendly
8525300	8527300	she's like Fia was hiding under the bed she didn't want
8527300	8529300	to come out and she usually she only does
8529300	8531300	that if she feels like she's
8531300	8533300	not feeling good or she feels threatened
8533300	8535300	like a cat doesn't want to be bothered
8535300	8537300	and all that stuff so I'm like hmm interesting
8537300	8539300	um but as for me
8539300	8541300	uh yeah I
8543300	8545300	traveling was a nightmare I died I
8545300	8547300	I'm gonna have to do it again soon um
8547300	8549300	and I don't want to do
8549300	8551300	it I have to travel again like October
8551300	8553300	I still don't know the dates for another
8553300	8555300	thing another family thing
8555300	8557300	I think that'll also
8557300	8559300	be it won't be in Florida again but
8559300	8561300	I just got really dizzy
8561300	8563300	because I'm moving my head around
8563300	8565300	looking for the cats um
8565300	8567300	so yeah
8567300	8569300	I'll give you the rundown
8577300	8579300	so what was supposed to
8579300	8581300	so I I didn't tell you guys
8581300	8583300	because I also didn't say a lot what was going on
8583300	8585300	with me or talk about
8585300	8587300	what was going on with me because I didn't want you guys to worry
8587300	8589300	and I didn't just want to go on my twitter and
8589300	8591300	just like be like my life sucks
8591300	8593300	this happened that happened this
8593300	8595300	happened um but I did have a layover
8595300	8597300	um
8597300	8599300	an ATL if you guys just like be in
8599300	8601300	an airport um
8603300	8605300	and to get to
8605300	8607300	the place where I was going
8607300	8609300	and what should have been
8609300	8611300	like a quick flight
8611300	8613300	afterwards
8613300	8615300	turned out to be
8615300	8617300	like four hours of waiting
8617300	8619300	on a taxiway because I think
8619300	8621300	around that time is when the stuff went down
8621300	8623300	but we didn't know that
8623300	8625300	um yeah I hate that fucking airport
8625300	8627300	I'll tell you that right now
8627300	8629300	um I hate airports
8629300	8631300	I hate crowds of people I like
8631300	8633300	I get sick very easily
8633300	8635300	and I'm surprised I didn't get sick
8635300	8637300	I immediately took a shower
8637300	8639300	when I got to my family's house
8639300	8641300	and I was like I need to get this gross off me
8641300	8643300	so I already had
8643300	8645300	a few hours and then I had to wait
8645300	8647300	another few hours
8647300	8649300	and I just hate I didn't have a direct flight
8649300	8651300	so I'm just like I hate it here
8651300	8653300	um
8653300	8655300	and then I didn't get to my
8655300	8657300	grandparents house until like
8657300	8659300	3am because they couldn't come pick me up
8659300	8661300	because they're older and they don't have the luxury
8661300	8663300	of driving at night like I didn't want to put them
8663300	8665300	in that situation so I took me a while to
8665300	8667300	excuse me find me a
8667300	8669300	ride I couldn't get a rental car
8669300	8671300	there's no rental cars available
8671300	8673300	um
8673300	8675300	and
8675300	8677300	I managed to get an Uber and I
8677300	8679300	dropped a good chunk of change on an Uber
8679300	8681300	so that was fun
8681300	8683300	then I finally got there and I was half dead
8683300	8685300	and then
8685300	8687300	the weather was shit the majority of the time
8689300	8691300	so I couldn't really do a lot
8691300	8693300	there was like one sunny day
8693300	8695300	and it was just gross and humid and I hated it
8697300	8699300	I think honestly the only funny thing
8699300	8701300	was when that frog somehow got in the house
8701300	8703300	into the toilet
8703300	8705300	it was fun catching it
8705300	8707300	because my whole family was like
8707300	8709300	and I'm the only one that likes
8709300	8711300	bugs and like amphibians
8711300	8713300	and reptiles and invertebrates
8713300	8715300	so I just like yanked it and I'm like
8715300	8717300	you're mine you're gonna be my friend
8717300	8719300	I was gonna kiss it
8719300	8721300	and then my but my grandmother was
8721300	8723300	freaking out so I didn't do that
8723300	8725300	but our frog and a snake
8725300	8727300	I've grabbed snakes before
8727300	8729300	um when I would go with my
8729300	8731300	I've mentioned my grandfather before when I would go
8731300	8733300	in the woods my grandfather I snatched a snake up
8733300	8735300	and like I know I know my snakes
8735300	8737300	so I know one one's poisonous
8737300	8739300	and one's not
8739300	8741300	it was like a little rat snake that I
8741300	8743300	snatched and I was like
8747300	8749300	frog was cannon
8749300	8751300	and so yeah I put the frog outside
8751300	8753300	somebody was like flush it I'm like
8753300	8755300	what that's just messed up
8755300	8757300	and I'm not gonna flush a frog down the toilet
8757300	8759300	although I know that's where you crawled up from
8759300	8761300	but it was it was really weird
8761300	8763300	I felt something wet on my butt cheek
8763300	8765300	um it was because
8765300	8767300	the frog was behind the seat
8767300	8769300	and it was like trying to get away from my fat ass
8769300	8771300	I was just gonna sit on it
8771300	8773300	um
8773300	8775300	so I left it outside
8775300	8777300	that was me my pet
8779300	8781300	I was about to drop some heat too I was like
8781300	8783300	I was about to blow that shit up
8783300	8785300	that's probably what it died
8787300	8789300	cause I get really sick after it cause I get
8789300	8791300	motion sick and the motion sick makes me nauseous
8791300	8793300	and the nauseous gives me tummy upset
8793300	8795300	and that was just a bad thing
8795300	8797300	um and then so I finally
8797300	8799300	like we're hanging out whatever
8799300	8801300	is fine but I was so
8801300	8803300	tired and I felt so
8803300	8805300	crappy the entire time
8805300	8807300	that we couldn't really do anything so I literally
8807300	8809300	just like watched Elden Ring videos
8809300	8811300	and I forgot my switch
8811300	8813300	and I was pissed cause
8813300	8815300	like my family likes to play like Mario Party
8815300	8817300	when we're all together like that was our thing
8817300	8819300	like they always come over our house
8819300	8821300	my family's house and we all play Mario Party
8821300	8823300	um a frog was spared
8823300	8825300	um
8825300	8827300	nobody got there a snake
8827300	8829300	no a knife
8829300	8831300	no um
8831300	8833300	I
8833300	8835300	like Elden Ring
8835300	8837300	I'm so happy it's my hyper fixation again
8837300	8839300	cause I need that I need a distraction
8839300	8841300	and Elden Ring is my distraction
8841300	8843300	um
8845300	8847300	cause I also didn't want to hear talk about church
8847300	8849300	and stuff for my family
8849300	8851300	um and then
8851300	8853300	going back was also a nightmare
8853300	8855300	uh go ahead and do an overlay
8855300	8857300	an overlay
8857300	8859300	a layover in ATL again
8859300	8861300	and there's so many people trapped in that airport
8861300	8863300	um because the flights
8863300	8865300	were all messed up
8865300	8867300	for like a lot of the airlines
8867300	8869300	and it sucked
8869300	8871300	I heard so many stories
8871300	8873300	people in the south
8873300	8875300	they're just so nice those telling you anything
8875300	8877300	to a woman she's telling me her whole life story
8877300	8879300	and I'm just like
8879300	8881300	I'm from the north I'm like who the fuck do you think you talk
8881300	8883300	don't talk to me then I'm like but then you know
8883300	8885300	I put on my sweet smile
8885300	8887300	and I'm like hey okay
8887300	8889300	um
8889300	8891300	new theory about
8891300	8893300	America being a jar person
8893300	8895300	instead of being a normal being
8895300	8897300	nice
8897300	8899300	amazing theory I think you should
8899300	8901300	she definitely do a deep dive
8901300	8903300	did your family question you about your job they did
8903300	8905300	it was very awkward
8905300	8907300	I just kept saying I was under NDA
8907300	8909300	and then I was just like
8909300	8911300	I'm just a voice actor
8911300	8913300	actress whatever um and I worked for
8913300	8915300	a social media startup so I was just like throwing out everything
8915300	8917300	I should have said I worked for the government
8917300	8919300	but I don't think my grandparents would believe me
8919300	8921300	um yeah we don't do that up there
8921300	8923300	we don't do that up in the north
8923300	8925300	mm-mm
8925300	8927300	we're hard and cold in the north
8927300	8929300	um
8929300	8931300	all the ones words literally
8931300	8933300	and uh

8937300	8939300	my I was up till
8939300	8941300	since 3 a.m. because you guys
8941300	8943300	like in my space I was like
8943300	8945300	I'm doing my makeup now I'm getting ready
8945300	8947300	now because I'm not going to be able to do this
8947300	8949300	when I first wake up I'm happy I did that
8949300	8951300	um I woke up at 3
8951300	8953300	I got made sure everything was good
8953300	8955300	I called an Uber for about
8955300	8957300	because they couldn't drive me
8957300	8959300	like an hour and a half
8959300	8961300	and then finally around

8965300	8967300	and this dude
8967300	8969300	decides to just talk to me the entire time
8969300	8971300	and I'm like dude it's 4 a.m.

8981300	8983300	shadows like a jar or houses ill
8985300	8987300	are you being legit with your theory
8987300	8989300	because I'm going to laugh at you
8989300	8991300	anyways
8991300	8993300	uh but like
8993300	8995300	I'm like I can be nice so I was like

9453300	9455300	covid and then literally
9455300	9457300	the day before I didn't know I had covid I went to an
9457300	9459300	amusement park when I had covid whoops
9461300	9463300	and
9463300	9465300	unlike one of those like spinny
9465300	9467300	I don't know what the fuck it's called it was six flags

9471300	9473300	but it just spun you around a lot
9473300	9475300	and I was so
9475300	9477300	I should have never done that
9477300	9479300	it wasn't teacups
9479300	9481300	but it was something yeah it was like a world
9481300	9483300	gig looking thing that's a good way to say it
9483300	9485300	um
9485300	9487300	and

9503300	9505300	the book that I bought at the airport
9505300	9507300	uh Raina and Fia were with me
9507300	9509300	Boomi snuggled with me for a little bit
9509300	9511300	which I was surprised because he

9635300	9637300	it's the next day
9637300	9639300	in the middle of the day
9639300	9641300	I get the worst pains
9641300	9643300	of my life
9643300	9645300	uh
9645300	9647300	and I don't even know what triggered it
9647300	9649300	I don't know if I got food poisoning
9649300	9651300	I don't know if I have a had a virus
9651300	9653300	or have a virus currently that I'm just like
9653300	9655300	working out of my system
9655300	9657300	I thought fun story time
9657300	9659300	was enemies were prayer friends
9659300	9661300	I was one random tough man so it was really
9661300	9663300	um
9663300	9665300	I
9665300	9667300	felt like I was
9667300	9669300	being
9669300	9671300	stabbed
9671300	9673300	in the gut
9673300	9675300	and the pain was so
9675300	9677300	unbearable I was trying not to
9677300	9679300	cry I have a very high pain
9679300	9681300	tolerance but it was bad
9681300	9683300	um
9683300	9685300	it was probably some of the worst excruciating
9685300	9687300	pain I've ever felt
9687300	9689300	and
9689300	9691300	it was it was just horrible
9691300	9693300	I would never want to go through that again
9693300	9695300	um it was horrible
9695300	9697300	because it was affecting because like how
9697300	9699300	uh
9699300	9701300	I think it never bothered me the first time like
9701300	9703300	because I've had pain like that
9703300	9705300	but I didn't have fibro when I had pain like that
9705300	9707300	so it's different now because it hurts all the
9707300	9709300	nerves in my body so my like
9709300	9711300	that from I started from my stomach
9711300	9713300	it shot down my legs I don't know if you guys
9713300	9715300	have ever had sciatica
9715300	9717300	or sciatic pain
9717300	9719300	I had both my legs uh it also shot
9719300	9721300	through my chest and into my shoulder and
9721300	9723300	down my right arm
9723300	9725300	and that's my arm that's bad and my
9725300	9727300	shoulders messed up um
9727300	9729300	I was really just curled up on a ball
9729300	9731300	I really ripped up all my clothes
9731300	9733300	I was just naked laying
9733300	9735300	on the cold floor and just rocking myself
9735300	9737300	and I thought I was gonna die
9737300	9739300	and I didn't know what was gonna happen
9739300	9741300	and
9741300	9743300	it sounds like a I thought I
9743300	9745300	literally thought it was like as I
9745300	9747300	didn't know if I was having a heart attack I didn't know
9747300	9749300	if my I thought my appendix was
9749300	9751300	exploding
9751300	9753300	um I was so scared
9753300	9755300	because I'm like
9755300	9757300	family's just gonna come in
9757300	9759300	because my mom has a key to my place
9759300	9761300	and she's just gonna find me dead naked
9761300	9763300	in my bathroom and just like
9763300	9765300	not know what the fuck happened to me
9765300	9767300	and I'm literally sitting there
9767300	9769300	and I feel my body just
9769300	9771300	going cold and I'm like
9771300	9773300	oh this is it this is how I die
9773300	9775300	I wasn't so pain
9775300	9777300	and I was just like my phone was across the room
9777300	9779300	I couldn't call 911
9779300	9781300	um I couldn't call my parents
9781300	9783300	my watch was far away from me
9783300	9785300	because I had taken it off to shower
9785300	9787300	uh not yeah
9787300	9789300	and I just never put it back on the charger
9789300	9791300	or pack anywhere and so I was really just like
9791300	9793300	and then I managed to pull myself onto the toilet
9793300	9795300	um
9795300	9797300	and uh
9797300	9799300	I have a tummy upset
9799300	9801300	and then at the same time
9801300	9803300	from both ends
9803300	9805300	uh
9805300	9807300	I started just puking
9807300	9809300	in my sink just
9809300	9811300	fucking projectile vomiting
9811300	9813300	sweating
9813300	9815300	cold thinking I'm dying
9815300	9817300	I'm like great my body
9817300	9819300	shutting down I'm expelling all the
9819300	9821300	waste
9821300	9823300	um
9823300	9825300	it was bad
9825300	9827300	it was so bad but then I felt
9827300	9829300	better after I puked and I was just like
9829300	9831300	fuck do I have food poisoning and I'm like
9831300	9833300	I didn't even eat anything bad
9833300	9835300	that's what yeah when you when you guys saw that tweet
9835300	9837300	saying I threw up
9837300	9839300	that was literally what had just happened
9841300	9843300	uh I did feel better
9843300	9845300	and I decided like you know
9845300	9847300	it was I had to put like
9847300	9849300	it was bad
9849300	9851300	like it was bad in my sink and so I like
9851300	9853300	I had like
9853300	9855300	almost drunkenly clean up everything
9855300	9857300	and like
9857300	9859300	there's some drano down and hope that I caught
9859300	9861300	rid of it
9861300	9863300	and my cats are all around me
9863300	9865300	and they know something's wrong
9865300	9867300	like rena was

9869300	9871300	fia was like off
9871300	9873300	to the side but like
9873300	9875300	um rena was always on top of me for that
9875300	9877300	shit she's like she was up in my face

10067300	10069300	like you want some drugs and I'm like
10069300	10071300	I have been on so many medications
10071300	10073300	between my like
10073300	10075300	for my mental health, for my physical health
10075300	10077300	for my um
10077300	10079300	neuropathy
10079300	10081300	for like rheumatology issues
10081300	10083300	I'm like I'm tired of taking fucking
10083300	10085300	pills bro
10085300	10087300	I'm trying like
10087300	10089300	I would go totally holistic
10089300	10091300	if I could because I'm so
10091300	10093300	fucking tired of taking pills dude
10093300	10095300	um I literally don't
10095300	10097300	yeah that's why like that's the only
10097300	10099300	like what I was like alright
10099300	10101300	I think I have a stabbing pain in my gut
10101300	10103300	I'm puking my guts out
10103300	10105300	my body's gone cold
10105300	10107300	my organs must be shutting down
10107300	10109300	I will then
10109300	10111300	possibly
10111300	10113300	think about getting a
10113300	10115300	going to the
10115300	10117300	the doctors
10119300	10121300	I can see one of those medical recast videos
10121300	10123300	getting made, VTuber eats moldy rice
10123300	10125300	this is what happened to her body
10125300	10127300	I had like moldy bread on accident the other day and I was fine
10127300	10129300	I had salmon that was
10129300	10131300	left out in water
10131300	10133300	defrosting that I forgot
10133300	10135300	about I was fine I'm like
10135300	10137300	what the fuck is going on I think
10137300	10139300	that's why I'm like my mom just said I think
10139300	10141300	your body was just so stress
10141300	10143300	and you had already had something inside
10143300	10145300	that you just your when you finally
10145300	10147300	got to relax your body just like couldn't
10147300	10149300	take it
10149300	10151300	yeah they add up
10151300	10153300	only bread
10153300	10155300	has pedestal that's fine
10155300	10157300	it's some weird thing when I was a state
10157300	10159300	very similar to when I've been high for two

10841300	10843300	but I'm not autistic I think
10843300	10845300	I think it's somewhat common yeah
10847300	10849300	because I don't like making noise when I walk
10849300	10851300	okay
10853300	10855300	at least I'm not the only person
10855300	10857300	that doesn't that does that
10857300	10859300	the walks on our toes sometimes
10863300	10865300	like I'll just do it in general
10865300	10867300	I just don't like making noise when I walk at all
10869300	10871300	so I'll walk weird
10871300	10873300	my mom says I bounce when I walk
10873300	10875300	she's like why are you so bouncy
10875300	10877300	just walk normal and I'm like I don't know
10879300	10881300	Reina just had to put the mic
10883300	10885300	I need to get a little
10885300	10887300	cat
10887300	10889300	mascot
10889300	10891300	in the form of Reina
10893300	10895300	because I don't know if I get all three cats
10895300	10897300	and just like have them surround me
10899300	10901300	she tip toes like a cartoon
10901300	10903300	villain yeah exactly
10905300	10907300	but yeah I'm very glad
10907300	10909300	to
10909300	10911300	Reina on your head
10911300	10913300	yeah I have one cat under each arm
10913300	10915300	and then Reina is just on my head
10915300	10917300	I don't know if I can make this model
10917300	10919300	and go bald I'll be honest with you
10919300	10921300	I'll have to do try to figure out a bald toggle
10927300	10929300	they add the cats
10929300	10931300	to the family treat no they're not
10931300	10933300	they're just my babies they're separate
10933300	10935300	they're not part of that mess
10937300	10939300	I know people who did that a lot
10939300	10941300	don't get surgery later in life
10941300	10943300	because doing that messed up their legs
10943300	10945300	oh walking in your toes
10947300	10949300	oh maybe
10955300	10957300	it's called it it's on a family treat
10957300	10959300	it's a wreath alright so I'm gonna say
10959300	10961300	um
10963300	10965300	I don't know what I'm gonna say
10965300	10967300	I'm just like
10967300	10969300	losing my train of thought
10971300	10973300	no wreath
10973300	10975300	w-r-e-a-t-h
10975300	10977300	wreath
10977300	10979300	using a sentence
10979300	10981300	my mom made a beautiful Christmas wreath this year
10981300	10983300	wreath
10983300	10985300	I was good in spelling bees
10985300	10987300	so I'm gonna say
10989300	10991300	wreath
10991300	10993300	they also uh
10993300	10995300	when they updated my model for the toggle
10995300	10997300	they also changed my mouth tracking
10997300	10999300	so it's a little bit weirder and I have to fix it again
10999300	11001300	my mouth doesn't open all the way
11001300	11003300	it's very odd
11005300	11007300	can I get a location of origin
11009300	11011300	I don't fucking know well no
11011300	11013300	I can't give you an a- they need
11013300	11015300	the person who's
11015300	11017300	testing you gives a location
11017300	11019300	of origin
11019300	11021300	velar spelling bee
11021300	11023300	strani can't spell
11023300	11025300	because she's Scottish
11025300	11027300	Azura
11027300	11029300	I think would just fall asleep
11029300	11031300	and they would go to her turn
11031300	11033300	and she'd just be asleep
11033300	11035300	uh mercy
11035300	11037300	would do well
11039300	11041300	emmy
11041300	11043300	would only ask for
11043300	11045300	words that were inappropriate
11045300	11047300	I see would just
11047300	11049300	be like
11049300	11051300	this is not fair
11051300	11053300	English isn't my first language
11053300	11055300	after she gets like one word wrong
11055300	11057300	and we give her a second
11057300	11059300	and she would just be like
11059300	11061300	no
11061300	11063300	let me so we'd have to like give her like
11065300	11067300	Russian words
11067300	11069300	haha
11073300	11075300	yeah because
11075300	11077300	Scottish spelling is very phonetic
11077300	11079300	very much like krill
11081300	11083300	yeah all my fucking god
11083300	11085300	you expect me to spell this shit
11085300	11087300	and she just fucking like
11087300	11089300	eat something across the room right now
11089300	11091300	I just was gonna go put right on the ground
11091300	11093300	and she just immediately just
11093300	11095300	gripped my shoulder
11095300	11097300	um
11097300	11099300	but yeah
11103300	11105300	it's like a club
11105300	11107300	it's funny so
11107300	11109300	strani really shouldn't have
11109300	11111300	set this up like this
11111300	11113300	but she puts all of our models in a drive
11113300	11115300	folder
11115300	11117300	but
11117300	11119300	but I see and Emmys are separate
11119300	11121300	so I can't get to their models
11121300	11123300	I was like really debating whether or not
11123300	11125300	I'm gonna come back and I'm just like
11125300	11127300	mercy on the screen
11129300	11131300	because if I were I would totally
11131300	11133300	yank I see his model and be like
11133300	11135300	hello everybody
11137300	11139300	oh yeah
11139300	11141300	I'm hoping she's getting a well deserved break
11141300	11143300	she's been very stressed
11143300	11145300	make sure you guys if you're a snowberry
11145300	11147300	your dada give her lots of love
11149300	11151300	um
11151300	11153300	impressions yeah I can I can literally
11153300	11155300	only do icy though out of my gen mates
11155300	11157300	and then I can kind of do a zero
11157300	11159300	everyone swaps models
11161300	11163300	um
11165300	11167300	I would like show up
11167300	11169300	and like
11169300	11171300	because I like I could definitely grab like
11171300	11173300	mercy's or is there a model or strani's
11173300	11175300	I'm very tempted to yank
11175300	11177300	because strani has all our models too
11177300	11179300	I'm tempted to yank
11179300	11181300	because she backs them up for us
11181300	11183300	uh strani's model
11183300	11185300	when I collab with her
11185300	11187300	and just like show up as her and she'll be like
11187300	11189300	what the a**
11189300	11191300	what the f**k
11191300	11193300	I can't even do her voice right now
11193300	11195300	like
11195300	11197300	what the f**k in hell
11197300	11199300	yeah I just I'm sounding British
11199300	11201300	and then I'll just be like
11201300	11203300	eww reeflings look into my eyes
11203300	11205300	you're falling in love with me now instead
11205300	11207300	I'm the real
11207300	11209300	strani consoles
11211300	11213300	which girl would you want to do
11213300	11215300	a she be impression with your model
11215300	11217300	uh emmy or mercy
11217300	11219300	emmy is a good dom and mercy is a good
11219300	11221300	dom so I think
11221300	11223300	I think that would be really funny
11223300	11225300	uh
11225300	11227300	I would like to as you guys know
11227300	11229300	I love cute and funny stuff so I would
11229300	11231300	like to yank emmy's
11231300	11233300	or icy's model as a meme
11233300	11235300	although it'd be very funny
11235300	11237300	if me and zura were both like cute
11237300	11239300	and funny
11239300	11241300	and then
11241300	11243300	um I think or emmy would be funny
11243300	11245300	having strani's model
11247300	11249300	or icy was
11249300	11251300	strani's model
11251300	11253300	I see with the zura's model I'm just thinking of
11253300	11255300	all the combinations it's funny
11255300	11257300	mercy would just laugh
11257300	11259300	as she would she would just jiggle my boobs
11261300	11263300	I'm just gonna use the whip a lot
11266300	11268300	imposter oh no
11268300	11270300	I need to be strong
11270300	11272300	we are so back

11277300	11279300	oh
11279300	11281300	mercy miss mental illness

11293300	11295300	anymore yet no I just got back
11295300	11297300	I just got here
11297300	11299300	I don't even know where it went oh yeah I shoved
11299300	11301300	it in my closet so my mom couldn't find it
11301300	11303300	but then I ended up kinda showing her
11303300	11305300	where it was because I put the cat
11305300	11307300	carrier in the same spot she's like
11307300	11309300	what if I need to get the cats out if there's
11309300	11311300	emergency and I'm like fuck
11311300	11313300	it's in the same spot as I put the whip
11313300	11315300	so I had to take out the whip
11315300	11317300	and then take out the cat carrier
11317300	11319300	and be like it's right here and then put it back
11319300	11321300	pretend that everything
11321300	11323300	was normal
11323300	11325300	how would you power
11325300	11327300	scale you and the girls
11327300	11329300	based off of what
11329300	11331300	Azura
11331300	11333300	is gonna be the most powerful she's literally
11333300	11335300	god
11335300	11337300	so
11337300	11339300	um and then
11339300	11341300	strongy
11341300	11343300	no no and then emmy because of her
11343300	11345300	book and then strongy because her hypnotism
11345300	11347300	I
11347300	11349300	I'm
11349300	11351300	literally probably the weakest now
11351300	11353300	they think of it I see because
11353300	11355300	of her polar bear upbringing
11355300	11357300	mercy because she just knows how to kill
11357300	11359300	people and torture them
11359300	11361300	and me I'm just
11361300	11363300	I just do that sexually so I'm like I'm
11363300	11365300	I yeah
11365300	11367300	I guess I'm the weakest
11367300	11369300	affection meter
11369300	11371300	um
11371300	11373300	she was just
11373300	11375300	I'm just some girl I'm just some bunny girl
11375300	11377300	that runs a hotel
11377300	11379300	bro
11379300	11381300	I'm just freaky canonical
11381300	11383300	I'm literally the only freaky one canonically
11383300	11385300	everybody else is normal
11385300	11387300	like if you really think about it I'm the actual
11387300	11389300	one that's like on the nose for my
11389300	11391300	my my uh my niche
11391300	11393300	um for affection
11397300	11399300	hmm that's a tough one
11399300	11401300	I would say
11403300	11405300	who's the most affectionate
11405300	11407300	for their fans
11407300	11409300	I would honestly say that
11409300	11411300	me and strongy are tied
11411300	11413300	at the top
11413300	11415300	then emmy
11415300	11417300	then I see
11419300	11421300	the mercy and azura
11421300	11423300	I think that's how I do it
11425300	11427300	I think
11427300	11429300	me and
11429300	11431300	strongy are very similar in our
11431300	11433300	affection
11437300	11439300	yeah it's hard to rank that because
11439300	11441300	we all like show our affection in different
11441300	11443300	ways
11445300	11447300	mercy was an ex student yeah but she
11447300	11449300	fucking kills people
11449300	11451300	um
11451300	11453300	because me and strongy
11453300	11455300	I think
11455300	11457300	are very
11457300	11459300	and yes I'll use this term
11459300	11461300	just because of how we are like we just
11461300	11463300	like spending time with you
11463300	11465300	um and we just talk a lot and we just want to
11465300	11467300	hang out and play games with you
11467300	11469300	um
11469300	11471300	emmy is as different because
11471300	11473300	again it's familial
11473300	11475300	and a little like
11475300	11477300	it's yeah it's
11477300	11479300	really hard
11479300	11481300	to
11481300	11483300	kind of because everybody kind of expresses
11483300	11485300	themselves in different ways
11489300	11491300	I don't know if she be you can just pull off
11491300	11493300	your own voice and make someone do whatever you want
11493300	11495300	that's true I liked so like in my
11495300	11497300	PL I love switching my voice up because
11497300	11499300	people would come in and I'd be like hi everybody
11499300	11501300	my name is uh Rana Noi
11501300	11503300	and today we're just playing
11503300	11505300	whatever the fuck I was playing at the time
11505300	11507300	and um
11507300	11509300	then
11509300	11511300	they'd be like oh how's it going I'd be like it's
11511300	11513300	going fine thank you
11513300	11515300	and they're just like

11779300	11781300	I definitely need to fix the rigging around my mouth
11781300	11783300	because I'm not as

11785300	11787300	as much as I normally do
11787300	11789300	so I don't know why
11789300	11791300	unless I over exaggerate
11793300	11795300	so I definitely need to fix my physics
11795300	11797300	I have my uh cover up
11797300	11799300	for my boobies coming soon

11815300	11817300	it's just a toggle
11817300	11819300	my

11847300	11849300	on the model
11849300	11851300	because I like it looks lighter on one screen
11851300	11853300	but it's darker on the other so I might lighten myself up a little bit
11853300	11855300	for a little bit

11857300	11859300	copy um yeah as a game or something
