Hello.

25
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,820
What?

26
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,820
Is something the matter?

27
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,820
What's wrong?

28
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,820
What are you...

29
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,820
Guys, what's the matter? Everybody's freaking out.

30
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,820
Is something on my face?

31
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,820
Weird.

32
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,820
Anyways, how are you guys doing today?

33
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,820
That boob has a head? What?

34
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,820
What are you talking about? I'm looking at my model, I look fine.

35
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:49,820
I don't know.

36
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:56,820
Um...

37
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,820
Did you remember to tweet?

38
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,820
Yeah, I should do that.

39
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,820
So no head.

40
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,820
Smash his phone.

41
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:15,820
Am I okay?

42
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:17,820
I'm fine.

43
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:19,820
I'm great.

44
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,820
I'm having a great time.

45
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,820
I'm dressed real cute.

46
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,820
I'm wearing a t-shirt.

47
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:34,820
And my t-shirt says it's Necko or it's Heckno.

48
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,820
I bet if you google it you can see exactly what t-shirt I'm wearing.

49
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:41,820
Strony raid.

50
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,820
Ow!

51
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,820
Ow no! Hello!

52
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,820
Wait.

53
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,820
Wait, you guys missed my bit.

54
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,820
So, I was at... Do you guys um...

55
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,820
I have a really important question for you.

56
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,820
You guys want some head?

57
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,820
Cause I got you.

58
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,820
Yeah! Yeah, here it is.

59
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,820
There's the head.

60
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,820
Here's the head you ordered.

61
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,820
Is this not what you wanted?

62
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,820
See, this is my cover up for stream.

63
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,820
What do you mean it's cursed?

64
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,820
Mom!

65
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,820
Mother, you don't love me.

66
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,820
You did this to me.

67
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,820
You bathed me from your loins.

68
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,820
I'm stuck like this.

69
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,820
You need bread when you have head, you know?

70
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,820
Yeah.

71
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,820
Can I add another head?

72
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,820
Actually, can I?

73
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,820
Can I add another head?

74
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,820
Oh!

75
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,820
I have to like get rid of the...

76
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,820
My shadow for my stuff.

77
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,820
We are...

78
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,820
The madams 3.

79
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,820
Would you like to have your way with me?

80
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,820
Are you not entertained?

81
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,820
Do you not want to get brain?

82
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,820
Be not afraid.

83
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,820
Be not afraid.

84
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,820
I wish I had reverb so I could be like

85
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,820
Be not afraid, my child.

86
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,820
Wait, hold on.

87
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,820
Wait, I think I do a reverb.

88
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,820
Uno momento.

89
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,820

Be not afraid!

94
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,820
Is it working?

95
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,820
Come forth, my child.

96
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,820
I will not harm you.

97
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:29,820
I care for you so, come into my warm embrace.

98
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:36,820
Let me bring you into my frail against my bosom.

99
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,820
Give me a kiss.

100
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,820
I will not harm you.

101
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,820
Wait, hold on.

102
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,820
I have another idea.

103
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,820
Please hold.

104
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,820
Hold.

105
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,820
Hold.

106
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,820
Please hold.

107
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,820
Will this work?

108
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,820
Wait a minute.

109
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,820
Wait a minute.

110
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,820
Please hold.

111
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,820
Please hold.

112
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,820
We interrupt this program to bring you

113
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,820
three-headed sheebie.

114
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:42,820
Please lock your doors if you see a three-headed sheebie.

115
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,820
Do not look directly at the sheebie.

116
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,820
If she has more, then three heads.

117
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,820
Two is fine.

118
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,820
Wait, hold on.

119
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,820
I'm coming right at you!

120
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,820
My neighbors are walking by.

121
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,820
I thought you were a rabbit, not a hydra.

122
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,820
Hell, hydra!

123
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,820
Can I put it?

124
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,820
Oh, oh, hold on.

125
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,820
I need to make this smaller.

126
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,820
No!

127
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,820
Make this bigger.

128
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,820
Oh, wait.

129
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,820
Please hold.

130
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:40,820
Please hold.

131
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,820
Please hold.

132
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:42,820
Please hold.

133
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,820
Please hold.

134
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,820
Please hold.

135
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:46,820
Please hold.

136
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,820
Oh, wait.

137
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,820
Please hold on a moment.

138
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:51,820
Fuck.

139
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,820
There's a lot going on right now.

140
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,820
And perfect.

141
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,820
I got my cover up.

142
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,820
All sorted.

143
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,820
Do you guys like it?

144
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,820
No?

145
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,820
Is this distracting?

146
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,820
Why is one bigger than the other?

147
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:38,820
Breasts are like cousins more than sisters.

148
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,820
Just like your eyebrows.

149
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,820
Just like my eyes.

150
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,820
My eyes.

151
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,820
My eyes are down here.

152
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,820
Okay.

153
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:50,820
My eyes.

154
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,820
Wait, it just toggles for all of them.

155
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,820
Oh, god.

156
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,820
What are you doing?

157
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,820
I don't know what you're looking at.

158
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,820
It will.

159
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,820
Wait, wait.

160
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,820
Hold on.

161
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,820
Will this work?

162
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,820
Be not afraid.

163
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,820
I can't breathe.

164
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:42,820
Be not afraid.

165
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:47,820
Open your heart to me, Aaron.

166
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,820
We will become one.

167
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,820
A hive mind.

168
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,820
Let me into your soul.

169
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,820
Open the door.

170

Let me go get a drink.

187
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,820
I didn't grab a drink.

188
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,820
Actually, I have some coffee next to me, but...

189
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,820

What the hell? One of my frickin lady whistle down from Bridgerton.

Great show, by the way.

605
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:54,920
Let's see. Oh, there's different dominatrix.

606
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:01,920
All right, like, I gotta pick that.

607
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,920
I had, like...

608
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:15,920
What?

609
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,920
Ex-gymnastripper?

610
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,920
What?

611
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,920
It's a doom seer.

612
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:35,920
Oh, she, I just have severe anxiety. Also me.

613
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,920
Subtly insane. Also me.

614
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,920
Occult nut. Also me. I could be deaf?

615
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:59,920
Wait, if I'm deaf in the game, will I just not hear any dialogue?

616
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:06,920
Gymnastripper? I know, it's like very specific.

617
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:10,920
I was, like, I did do gymnastics for a little bit.

618
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,920
But, like, I don't, and it was never a stripper.

619
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,920
Although I do want to learn how to do pole for, like, 3D stuff.

620
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,920
That'd be super cool. Long and little foot.

621
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:29,920
Wait, I would just have one foot longer than the other?

622
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,920
Are you fucking, why the fuck would I ever pick that?

623
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,920
Okay.

624
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,920
But I like the crazy shit of a Malkavian.

625
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,920
Completely bad shit.

626
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,920
Okay.

627
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,920

00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,920

629
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,920
Why is it showing that?

630
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,920
Why is it showing, I didn't show my old games before.

631
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:09,920

632
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,920

00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,920

Shabinaldo, nah.

645
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,920
I'm not gonna be Shabron, well, you know.

646
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,920
Shabron.

647
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,920
I'm not putting Shibiti toilet.

648
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:19,920
Shabbatha, no.

649
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,920

00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,920
Yeah, I'm gonna put Shib, Shibusi.

654
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,920
I love you, Shibusi.

655
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,920
I'll spell it a different way, though.

656
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,920
Shibbuse.

657
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:45,920

Trickle down Shibon-

663
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,920
I've placed Shibonix.

Shib, Shib, Shibinomics.

665
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:08,920
I can't even.

666
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,920
Shab- Shabelle mentioned, no.

667
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,920
What was that book about the vampire rabbit?

668
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,920
I have no idea what you're talking about.

669
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,920
Guys, is Shabuse really winning right now?

670
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:27,920
Oh, but Nikula, yes, that's true, that's true.

671
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,920
Shabonomics, this is Finland.

672
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:34,920
Shabuya, Shabelle, Delfin, Nani.

673
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:36,920
Okay.

674
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,920
Shabonomics.

675
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,920
It was Shibuse.

676
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,920
We are Shibuse.

677
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,920
I'm generally surprised that it showed my last save

678
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,920
because when I was setting everything up before,

679
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,920
I was double checking if I had any save files

680
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:07,920
and it said I didn't.

681
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,920
And then when I put in the name before,

682
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,920
I was trying to speedrun to see if stuff worked

683
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:12,920
and it was like put in a name

684
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,920
and it didn't show any name.

685
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:16,920
Spooky, okay.

686
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,920
So I get automatic that.

687
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:23,920
Where did the audio go?

688
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,920
If there's like no audio in this part.

689
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,920
I had an apostrophe to make it classy.

690
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:32,920
But where?

691
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:34,920
Shibuse.

692
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:38,920
It just makes me sound so fucking ghetto.

693
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,920
Let's see.

694
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:46,920
This kind of doesn't matter to me

695
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,920
because I might do some like cheatsy doodlin

696
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,920
and like fucking

697
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:55,920
add shit later.

698
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:01,920
I think I'm gonna do firearms.

699
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:03,920
Yeah.

700
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,920
And intimidation naturally.

701
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:07,920
Can I not?

702
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:08,920
Yeah.

703
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:13,920
And then, you know, I should do knowledge and finance.

704
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,920
I'm making it based off of me.

705
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,920
I'm not making it based off of anything else.

706
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:19,920
Wait, what?

707
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,920
Game is haunted by my past life.

708
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:25,920
Rene.

709
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:26,920
Rene.

710
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,920
Rest in peace.

711
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,920
Rest in peace.

712
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:34,920
A little bit cheating for the bit.

713
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:37,920
Oh, what do you mean?

714
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:38,920
Like this?

715
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:39,920
Hold on.

716
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:40,920
I can't copy, paste.

717
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:41,920
Oh, wait.

718
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:44,920
Question mark.

719
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,920
Ah, that looks a lot better.

720
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:49,920
Thank you guys.

721
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:51,920
You want to do the

722
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:54,920
play you as well?

723
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:00,920
What the fuck?

724
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:01,920
Why does the question mark show up

725
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,920
when it goes too far?

726
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,920
I don't even know if this still sounds the same.

727
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:08,920
What is that?

728
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,920
My chat just fucking

729
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:14,920
exploded for some reason.

730
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,920
What are Shibi's best attributes?

731
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:20,920
Yappage.

732
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:22,920
Charisma.

733
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:23,920
100%.

734
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:25,920
Charisma.

735
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:26,920
100%.

736
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:35,920
I'm pretty strong.

737
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:44,920
It makes my intimidation go up,

738
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:45,920
which would be cool.

739
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:48,920
My research

740
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,920
range combat would be better.

741
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,920
Again, none of this really fucking matters.

742
00:46:58,920 --> 00:46:59,920
Why can't I?

743
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,920
I wish I could put it under physical.

744
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:07,920
Investigation.

745
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:09,920
Scholarship.

746
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,920
My persuasion would go up for that.

747
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:14,920
Haggle.

748
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,920
The 10 hour stream stamina.

749
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,920
I can't add anything to stamina though.

750
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:24,920
Dominate.

751
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:25,920
Put that up.

752
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:29,920
Knowledge.

753
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,920
It's more important than

754
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:36,920
whatever the fuck that guy says.

755
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:37,920
Knowledge.

756
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:40,920
Persuasion.

757
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:41,920
I might do that for persuasion.

758
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:42,920
Computer hacking.

759
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:51,920
Wait.

760
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:52,920
Hold on.

761
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:53,920
Fuck that.

762
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:55,920
Put that there.

763
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:56,920
Wait, what?

764
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:58,920
Fuck.

765
00:47:58,920 --> 00:47:59,920
Can we do one?

766
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:02,920
All right.

767
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:03,920
Is that everything?

768
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:04,920
It is.

769
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,920
Computer kind of useless,

770
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:08,920
but it

771
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:10,920
fine.

772
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:14,920
We are

773
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:16,920
really persuasive.

774
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:21,920
Christmas and Dominate.

775
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,920
Yeah, I'm going to dummy mommy through the thing.

776
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,920
Here in my garage.

777
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,920
My brand new Lamborghini.

778
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,920
Just remember the pass codes.

779
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:38,920
My

780
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:40,920
seduction is at three.

781
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:45,920
What?

782
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:46,920
Can we get a four?

783
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,920
Yeah, I'm not really intimidating.

784
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:54,920
Let's do that.

785
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,920
You totally go cool for me.

786
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:58,920
I'm going ghost.

787
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:02,920
Very sweet.

788
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:03,920
You guys are so sweet.

789
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:05,920
So fucking sweet.

790
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:06,920
What the hell?

791
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:08,920
Where my mouse go?

792
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:14,920
It's a phantom.

793
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,920
It's my extensive

794
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:17,920
Warhammer 40K

795
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:20,920
painted figurines.

796
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,920
Oh no, I got some paint on you.

797
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:31,920
For a dominatrix.

798
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,920
Why am I in such a shit place?

799
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,920
Why am I in such a shit place?

800
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,920
Why am I in such a shit place?

801
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,920
I don't think it's ever coming out.

802
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:48,920
I'm so sorry.

803
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:49,920
I just feel it.

804
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,920
The thing, the company went under, didn't they?

805
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:53,920
What the?

806
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,920
Step through the heart.

807
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:03,920
Good evening.

808
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:04,920
Good evening.

809
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:05,920
Good evening.

810
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:06,920
Good evening.

811
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:07,920
Good evening.

812
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:08,920
Good evening.

813
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:09,920
Good evening.

814
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:10,920
Good evening.

815
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:11,920
Good evening.

816
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:12,920
Good evening.

817
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,920
He looks like ten times shorter next to his goon.

818
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:20,920
They're making it.

819
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,920
Then is there another company that's taking it on?

820
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,920
I like it's like five people in the audience.

821
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:33,920
Oh, honey.

822
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:36,920
Ew.

823
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:37,920
Fuck off with that.

824
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:43,920
Check the watch.

825
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:44,920
That's not on his wrist.

826
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:47,920
Is it meant to be just subtitles?

827
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:50,920
Fine, is it too quiet?

828
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:54,920
Well, you're gonna have to wait.

829
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:58,920
Fine.

830
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:15,920
Was game about being a killer, Bella?

831
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:20,920
12 vampires.

832
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,920
Did more people get up in the audience?

833
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,920
He is rocking that shit.

834
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:38,920
He is like a cup.

835
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,920
He's looking like he's from a clockwork orange.

836
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:45,920
He got the fucking cloud sword.

837
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:49,920
Everybody's faces.

838
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:54,920
It's gonna be me.

839
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:03,920
Bro, he spawned.

840
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,920
Why is everybody's eyes so shifty?

841
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:14,920
This is bullshit.

842
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,920
Nine's really pretty, though.

843
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:24,920
I feel like how their eyes glance about

844
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:26,920
is probably the most weirdest thing

845
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,920
that's realistic in this game.

846
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:29,920
Nobody's blinking.

847
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:30,920
They blinked.

848
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:31,920
They blinked.

849
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:32,920
They blinked.

850
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:33,920
They blinked.

851
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:34,920
They blinked.

852
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:35,920
They blinked.

853
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:36,920
They blinked.

854
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:37,920
They blinked.

855
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:38,920
They blinked.

856
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:40,920
Nobody's blinking.

857
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:41,920
They blinked.

858
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:44,920
Nine's is hot.

859
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:48,920
Nine's is nice.

860
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:04,920
Okay, now what?

861
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,920
I was just here to dom people.

862
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:11,920
I don't know what happened.

863
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,920
There was handcuffs and I handcuffed him.

864
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,920
Then he like showed me his more hammer figurines

865
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:21,920
and then stabbed me with one of his really small paint brushes.

866
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:23,920
I'm not a vampire.

867
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:24,920
I'm human.

868
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,920
I hate their posture in this game.

869
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,920
I wish I could like, it's like being with my head cut off

870
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:38,920
when I'm wearing the outfit on my model.

871
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:40,920
Like, what the fuck is up with the posture?

872
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:41,920
My neck is broken.

873
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,920
I have scoliosis.

874
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,920
But honestly, this game,

875
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,920
I fucking love this game.

876
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,920
Like the aesthetic of this game so much.

877
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:00,920
It's cord mod posture.

878
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:02,920
Maybe your character is sad.

879
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,920
So just like real life for some of us.

880
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:06,920
Yikes.

881
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:10,920
It was ice if that's you bro.

882
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:11,920
I'm sorry.

883
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,920
I wish I could play this on controllers.

884
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:16,920
I could lean back.

885
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:17,920
You know what?

886
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:18,920
Lay in my chairboard.

887
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:24,920
Alright.

888
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:25,920
Oh fuck.

889
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:26,920
Oh god.

890
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:27,920
Oh Jake.

891
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:29,920
It's shake the dog.

892
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,920
Ah, look you know.

893
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,920
It's probably a lot for you to take in.

894
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:41,920
So why don't you let me show you the ropes?

895
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:42,920
What do you say?

896
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:44,920
Show me the ropes.

897
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:48,920
Show me the ropes.

898
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,920
Did somebody say show the ropes?

899
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:53,920
Okay anyways.

900
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,920
What voice should I give her?

901
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:00,920
I'm gonna put it to a vote.

902
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,920
The game's gonna be paused for a second.

903
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:10,920
Voice.

904
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:13,920
Or

905
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:15,920
Shibuse.

906
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:20,920
My voice.

907
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:23,920
Blue.

908
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,920
Why is bro looking like that?

909
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:28,920
Why is bro looking like that?

910
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,920
Dummy mommy.

911
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,920
AKA my patreon voice.

912
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:39,920
British.

913
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:40,920
Can I add a fifth one?

914
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,920
Cause I was gonna do valley girl.

915
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:48,920
Fuck my voice.

916
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:50,920
We're gonna do valley girl.

917
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,920
Oh, goodness gracious.

918
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:54,920
Lord hammer.

919
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:00,920
Let the games commence.

920
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:04,920
I was, wow.

921
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,920
I'm getting high praise for that.

922
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:09,920
Thank you.

923
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:10,920
Thank you everybody.

924
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:12,920
Wow.

925
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:15,920
You know, when I, when I joined this company, I didn't know.

926
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:17,920
I didn't know.

927
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,920
When I, when I joined this company, I didn't know.

928
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:23,920
That's my boobs creep up.

929
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,920
I didn't know that I would just be so in touch with my body

930
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,920
and be able to burp on command.

931
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:30,920
So I'd like to thank the academy.

932
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:32,920
I'd like to thank Strani, my gen mates.

933
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:35,920
Throw it in the montage.

934
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:37,920
Good D volume on that one.

935
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:41,920
Is it, is it Dummy mommy?

936
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:44,920
Want the Dummy mommy voice?

937
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:49,920
All right.

938
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:51,920
From a landslide.

939
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:54,920
Yes.

940
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:57,920
Okay.

941
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:58,920
The Patreon voice.

942
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:01,920
Got again to character.

943
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:03,920
Who are you?

944
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:07,920
I'm Jack.

945
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:18,920
Hmm.

946
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:27,920
I don't have much time.

947
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:28,920
Just give me the basics.

948
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:35,920
You think I can do that voice?

949
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:36,920
No.

950
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:42,920
The wink killed me.

951
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:43,920
Did I accidentally wink?

952
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:46,920
Okay.

953
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:49,920
The Vtuber company?

954
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:50,920
I know all about them.

955
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:56,920
Lemon squeezy.

956
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:01,920
Are we going in sneaky-beaky like?

957
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:05,920
Wrong text.

958
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:06,920
Speech voice.

959
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:07,920
Wasn't it enough?

960
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:09,920
I don't know.

961
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:10,920
I don't know.

962
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:11,920
I don't know.

963
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:12,920
I don't know.

964
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:13,920
I don't know.

965
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:14,920
I don't know.

966
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:15,920
Wrong text.

967
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:16,920
Speech voice.

968
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:17,920
Wasn't it an option?

969
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:19,920
I'm so sorry, Heron.

970
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:22,920
I'm listening.

971
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,920
This will probably be a long stream too.

972
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,920
I don't think I'll do another 10 hours for

973
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:34,920
Vampire of the Masquerade,

974
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,920
but I do really like this game,

975
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:39,920
so I might go a little bit past time.

976
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:46,920
I don't want to be a homicidal maniac.

977
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:56,920
But I want to be a homicidal maniac.

978
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:03,920
I was like, yeah.

979
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:04,920
Yeah.

980
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:05,920
Yeah.

981
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:06,920
Yeah.

982
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:14,920
Okay.

983
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:17,920
I think so.

984
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:22,920
That's funny.

985
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:24,920
I'll sleep the day off and laugh later.

986
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:25,920
See ya.

987
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:26,920
Okay.

988
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:35,920
Oh!

989
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:39,920
Brap Friends?

990
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:43,920
Brap Friends Doko?

991
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:50,920
That was less than the other one?

992
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:51,920
Okay, fine.

993
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:52,920
Why do I live in a shithole?

994
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:53,920

I forgot to stop feeding

1210

Figured it out

01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:42,780
Now it would have been awkward if I killed him. Oh any other drugs I can take

1212
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:47,100

01:19:03,260 --> 01:19:07,180
It took me like an hour to do that because I tried to kill everybody. Let's talk to Brian

1216
01:19:09,340 --> 01:19:11,340
Bye Brian

1217
01:19:13,100 --> 01:19:15,980
He's like a roid head or something

1218
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:22,300
I almost jumped into the fucking ocean. How the hell do I get out of here?

1219
01:19:27,020 --> 01:19:29,020
Hello

1220
01:19:29,580 --> 01:19:32,460
Oh, how am I supposed to see those fucking stairs?

1221
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:36,380
Spitting in the camera isn't necessary

1222
01:19:38,620 --> 01:19:44,380
Brian's first you're gonna catch. I know sweetie, cover up a little bit

1223
01:19:53,420 --> 01:19:55,420
What's up?

1224

What the hell are you guys doing? I'll talk to her. Hey

01:20:08,540 --> 01:20:10,540
Why is he smiling?

1227
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:14,620
Is it the father? Is it the father behind him?

1228
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:21,500
You're not making any sense

1229
01:20:25,340 --> 01:20:27,580
Do you guys always be shirtless and say I'm not good?

1230
01:20:29,340 --> 01:20:32,780
Okay, maybe I won't play this for multiple hours. I'm kidding if I'm going to get motion sick

1231
01:20:32,780 --> 01:20:35,580
It's over. Oh god. Oh god. We're on

1232
01:20:37,740 --> 01:20:39,740
Okay, bye

1233
01:20:45,740 --> 01:20:50,240
I could go up there and see what's up with the cops, but I'm just gonna focus on the main mission

1234
01:21:03,740 --> 01:21:10,220
Is the volume too low? Oh my god, the dog is barking outside. You hear it?

1235
01:21:13,580 --> 01:21:16,060
It's literally outside now barking it's fucking hell

Can I kill a cop can I give the cop a smooch and I pants the cop

1240
01:21:43,740 --> 01:21:45,740
Don't take that context

01:21:47,020 --> 01:21:51,260

1249
01:22:30,380 --> 01:22:32,380
Ow, I just hit my elbow

1250

No, I don't because I'm not a vampire. No, I'm gone. Fine. Don't admit it be that way

1251
01:22:41,740 --> 01:22:43,740

01:37:16,620 --> 01:37:18,620
I

1421
01:37:19,180 --> 01:37:21,180
Guys making out

1422
01:37:21,980 --> 01:37:23,980
There's a twin sest in there

1423
01:37:27,020 --> 01:37:29,020
Can I come in?

1424
01:37:31,660 --> 01:37:33,660
Azula

1425
01:37:36,300 --> 01:37:38,700
It's like the start of facade. Oh my god

1426
01:37:39,740 --> 01:37:41,740
facade

1427
01:37:42,220 --> 01:37:49,100
I haven't heard of the game in such a long time. Holy shit. Can I watch? Let me watch

1428
01:37:51,420 --> 01:37:53,420
What the fuck is going on?

1429
01:37:55,100 --> 01:37:57,260
Aw, she's in the she's in the bathroom

1430
01:38:02,860 --> 01:38:04,860
Hello, hey

1431
01:38:06,220 --> 01:38:10,620
Please come in. I do apologize for my sister's crassness. You're hot

1432
01:38:11,740 --> 01:38:18,140
She's unabashedly scandalous, but in the club business, I suppose that kind of personality is a necessary evil

1433
01:38:18,380 --> 01:38:20,380
I'm supposed to be watching one piece. You're good

1434
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:27,260
Um hold on I want to make sure of something

1435
01:38:31,660 --> 01:38:33,660
But I do something properly

1436
01:38:42,220 --> 01:38:44,220
You

1437
01:38:58,860 --> 01:39:03,020
Sorry don't mind me looking up a walkthrough

1438
01:39:12,540 --> 01:39:14,540
You

1439
01:39:20,060 --> 01:39:22,060
Face this is the way

1440
01:39:22,060 --> 01:39:27,900
Uh, I just want to make sure I can romance the both of them. So instead of just only one of them

1441
01:39:28,140 --> 01:39:30,140
It's very important to me

1442
01:39:32,700 --> 01:39:34,700
All right

1443
01:39:36,620 --> 01:39:39,180
I know like when I played before

1444
01:39:40,140 --> 01:39:44,540
It didn't work out and I was really depressed afterwards. I just want to make sure

1445
01:39:50,460 --> 01:39:52,460
So

1446
01:39:52,620 --> 01:39:58,620
I'm the proprietor of this club and the only person in this city whose good side it's in your best interest to stay on

1447
01:39:59,180 --> 01:40:01,180
What brings you to Santa Monica?

1448
01:40:02,060 --> 01:40:04,060
I

1449
01:40:04,460 --> 01:40:08,540
Call off the feud I need you to call off the feud of Bertram tongue

1450
01:40:09,020 --> 01:40:16,300
Tongue's exile is self-imposed. I assure you but then what reason would I have not to hate that lonesome nasferatu scoundrel

1451
01:40:16,780 --> 01:40:20,780
Bloody nosferatu. Oh my god. Is that miko hatune in the background?

1452
01:40:21,500 --> 01:40:23,500
Is that hatune miko?

1453
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:25,500
People

1454
01:40:30,300 --> 01:40:32,780
Why do you hate him he meddles in my affairs

1455
01:40:33,020 --> 01:40:37,100
He's a bad influence on my sister and she on him if you were in my place

1456
01:40:37,100 --> 01:40:43,900
Would you let him compromise your authority? You're most certainly would not I'd quite like it if I never hear that name again

1457
01:40:50,780 --> 01:40:52,780
I'm so sorry I uh

1458
01:40:53,740 --> 01:40:55,740
I

1459
01:41:11,900 --> 01:41:15,820
I'm so sorry teres. I didn't mean to burp in your face

1460
01:41:15,820 --> 01:41:17,820
Why would I do that?

1461
01:41:17,820 --> 01:41:19,820
Let him think I mean to kill him that way

1462
01:41:19,820 --> 01:41:21,820
I didn't know this was the case

1463
01:41:21,820 --> 01:41:23,820
Do you realize how this is happening?

1464
01:41:23,820 --> 01:41:25,820
I literally cuffed the microphone and I was like

1465
01:41:25,820 --> 01:41:27,820
Oh

1466
01:41:27,820 --> 01:41:29,820
Um

1467
01:41:29,820 --> 01:41:35,820
That's unfortunate, but I do need to see him tongue and his co-conspirators actions ruined my chance at parties

1468
01:41:35,820 --> 01:41:37,820
I don't know why I'm so sorry

1469
01:41:37,820 --> 01:41:39,820
I don't know why I'm so sorry

1470
01:41:39,820 --> 01:41:41,820
I don't know why I'm so sorry

1471
01:41:42,300 --> 01:41:47,420
Tong and his co-conspirators actions ruined my chance at partnership in a crucial piece of property

1472
01:41:47,980 --> 01:41:52,140
I do have several other promising ventures and one in particular has been

1473
01:41:52,780 --> 01:41:54,780
To save at least an ordeal

1474
01:41:55,900 --> 01:42:00,300
I'd be willing to put the word out that my grievances with tongue have been swept under the rug

1475
01:42:00,860 --> 01:42:05,580
But in return you'll have to help my god. I want a burrito from chipotle suddenly

1476
01:42:06,060 --> 01:42:08,060
I'm looking to invest in

1477
01:42:08,060 --> 01:42:11,420
Although every time I order from that chipotle, they always fuck up my order

1478
01:42:13,180 --> 01:42:15,260
Sorry, I because like I just like thought of it

1479
01:42:15,980 --> 01:42:17,980
Because I got a notification from an app

1480
01:42:18,620 --> 01:42:20,620
And I've only had

1481
01:42:21,020 --> 01:42:23,020
What did I eat today?

1482
01:42:23,660 --> 01:42:25,660
Serial

1483
01:42:27,500 --> 01:42:29,500
In a croissant

1484
01:42:29,500 --> 01:42:31,500
I had a croissant

1485
01:42:32,300 --> 01:42:34,300
It was a Nutella croissant

1486
01:42:36,540 --> 01:42:41,820
No, don't I got a burrito from chipotle yesterday to ruin my stomach

1487
01:42:44,060 --> 01:42:46,940
Yeah, every time I order they always get it wrong

1488
01:42:48,140 --> 01:42:50,060
I've had

1489
01:42:50,060 --> 01:42:52,060
Like and not like oh, they

1490
01:42:52,780 --> 01:42:55,340
Like forget to give me utensils or a straw like

1491
01:42:56,700 --> 01:43:00,780
What I ordered a burrito and they gave me only rice and meat

1492
01:43:02,700 --> 01:43:04,700
And I ordered it from door to

1493
01:43:05,260 --> 01:43:07,660
And I like what the fuck is this?

1494
01:43:10,060 --> 01:43:11,660
And then they're like

1495
01:43:11,660 --> 01:43:15,020
I'm like but they just out of everything and then and then I ordered another time

1496
01:43:15,900 --> 01:43:17,900
And I went the store to pick it up

1497
01:43:19,260 --> 01:43:21,760
And there was like 50 people in chipotle

1498
01:43:24,220 --> 01:43:29,500
If you got scared, yeah, literally I'm like why like I don't even like why did he not

1499
01:43:29,580 --> 01:43:34,060
Like they must have not been it like had anything and they just put meat and rice

1500
01:43:34,780 --> 01:43:36,780
And like cheese. I don't remember what else was there

1501
01:43:37,660 --> 01:43:39,100
um

1502
01:43:39,100 --> 01:43:40,700
and they

1503
01:43:40,700 --> 01:43:45,180
There's like 50 people in chipotle people who had been waiting for 30 minutes for the food they ordered

1504
01:43:45,740 --> 01:43:47,740
And so I waited 30 minutes

1505
01:43:48,380 --> 01:43:50,380
Then I waited an hour

1506
01:43:50,860 --> 01:43:55,420
And then I uh went to the chipotle app and I canceled my order and they refunded me

1507
01:43:56,780 --> 01:43:58,780
and then

1508
01:43:58,860 --> 01:44:02,220
At like 9 p.m. And mind you I went at 6 to pick it up

1509
01:44:02,940 --> 01:44:04,940
They're like my order was ready

1510
01:44:06,300 --> 01:44:08,300
I still got a notification it was ready and I'm like

1511
01:44:09,420 --> 01:44:13,500
Do I drive all the way back to fucking chipotle to

1512
01:44:14,700 --> 01:44:15,740

1513
01:44:15,740 --> 01:44:17,740

1514
01:44:18,060 --> 01:44:19,260
I'm like well

1515
01:44:19,260 --> 01:44:21,260
Some like I was going to

1516
01:44:21,260 --> 01:44:22,780
And I'm like I don't

1517
01:44:22,780 --> 01:44:26,700
Feel like I'm like I'm all comfy in bed. I'm like curl up with my little show

1518
01:44:27,820 --> 01:44:31,580
With my kitty cats and I'm like I'm not crawling out of bed to get free like I'm like whatever

1519
01:44:31,660 --> 01:44:34,860
I already I think I already already like made myself like um

01:44:36,460 --> 01:44:38,460
Some food anyways in the end

1521
01:44:39,340 --> 01:44:43,100
So I was just like really pissed and then the last time

1522
01:44:44,380 --> 01:44:46,140
They made

1523
01:44:46,140 --> 01:44:52,300
They forgot like half of the ingredients again and then for the salsa so you guys know I can't handle spice

1524
01:44:53,820 --> 01:44:59,100
Like I can only hand I can handle a little bit of spice, but like they're spiciest sauce I can't handle

1525
01:44:59,580 --> 01:45:03,500
I put like the mild salsa in there. They gave me the spiciest one

1526
01:45:04,140 --> 01:45:06,140
So I bit into it and I almost fucking died

1527
01:45:09,980 --> 01:45:13,500
And then they gave so and then as a like a thing

1528
01:45:14,140 --> 01:45:20,220
They gave me like a buy one get an entree free and I'm like what the fuck am I gonna do with two entrees

1530
01:45:24,780 --> 01:45:27,020
And it was like there's a certain amount of time I could use it

1531
01:45:27,020 --> 01:45:29,340
I'm like this is a fucking stupid. I can't even use this

1532
01:45:30,300 --> 01:45:32,300
You think I have friends no

1533
01:45:35,500 --> 01:45:38,620
Oh, yeah, it's and then like another time about that they just like

1538
01:45:54,540 --> 01:45:56,540
Like please

1539
01:45:57,100 --> 01:46:01,420
Never heard chipotle is begin what you said it must have been that yeah, I'd like don't eat there

1540
01:46:02,140 --> 01:46:05,580
Although there's another one that's like farther away from me. That one's fine

1541
01:46:06,460 --> 01:46:08,140
I'm like what the fuck?

1542
01:46:08,140 --> 01:46:10,300
Sorry white gal variant about chipotle

1543
01:46:13,900 --> 01:46:19,260
Gladly, what do I have to do rumor is that a personal item of a ghost maybe there's a taq area

1544
01:46:19,260 --> 01:46:24,060
That's open to me that I think I can order burrito from while I don't put a lot of stock in here say

1545
01:46:24,540 --> 01:46:30,780
It's my last option. So I want you to go to the ocean house hotel find an item of the spirits and bring it back

1546
01:46:33,660 --> 01:46:35,820
I'll do it if you promise to call off the feud

1547
01:46:36,300 --> 01:46:38,300
Oh, I fully intend to do so

1548
01:46:38,860 --> 01:46:44,060
You'll find that dealing with me on the whole is appreciably more looking to be up and down and I'm about to arc

1549
01:46:44,940 --> 01:46:46,060
Oh

1550
01:46:46,060 --> 01:46:49,660
So long as our business doesn't go sour. My word is gold

1551
01:46:50,300 --> 01:46:52,300
Can I just

1552
01:46:53,260 --> 01:46:55,260
Unbutton

1553
01:46:55,820 --> 01:47:00,380
Your shirt possible

1554
01:47:02,140 --> 01:47:05,900
Before I forget take this the only way to reach the ocean house

1555
01:47:06,860 --> 01:47:11,820
It's dangerous to go alone take this that key to open the gate for that tunnel

1556
01:47:15,580 --> 01:47:20,700
That's what it takes to get the job done baby girl if you'll excuse me I've got situations to set straight

1557
01:47:22,460 --> 01:47:24,460
Right. Goodbye

1558
01:47:25,100 --> 01:47:27,580
Oh, let me switch. I can't see the chat

1559
01:47:31,100 --> 01:47:33,600
Oh my god, my nose is fucking itchy

1560
01:47:38,060 --> 01:47:42,460
These assets in the game run the game star trick bridge command was made on the same time the same time graphics

1561
01:47:42,540 --> 01:47:47,500
Yeah, I actually I like I like these types of graphics. It's just like simple, but like

1562
01:47:48,380 --> 01:47:50,380
I don't know the aesthetic

1563
01:47:50,780 --> 01:47:52,780
I

1564
01:47:56,940 --> 01:47:59,260
Know what those are not allowed. Who are you talking to?

1565
01:48:00,220 --> 01:48:02,220
Jeanette, are you okay in there?

1566
01:48:02,460 --> 01:48:04,940
Jeanette. Oh, don't they look so cute?

1567
01:48:07,580 --> 01:48:09,580

01:48:09,980 --> 01:48:11,980

01:48:16,140 --> 01:48:18,140
Hold on. Yeah, that's funny

1571
01:48:18,940 --> 01:48:20,540

1572
01:48:20,540 --> 01:48:25,580
The same color eyes and janets janets has two different colored eyes and that doesn't like always confused me in this game

1573
01:48:26,300 --> 01:48:27,660
because

1574
01:48:27,660 --> 01:48:29,660
stuff

1575
01:48:32,220 --> 01:48:35,420
Fear and hungrass painting I never played that game is that game good?

1576
01:48:35,980 --> 01:48:38,620
I want a horror game to play. I just got outlast

1577
01:48:39,340 --> 01:48:42,460
And I'm debating whether to play outlast, but I feel like I'll get motion stick from outlast

1578
01:48:45,580 --> 01:48:47,580
It was on sale though, so

1579
01:48:49,100 --> 01:48:54,860
It's the hunger is great for suffering, but it's hard hard how

1580
01:49:00,300 --> 01:49:04,140
It's a fuck out of the way. Oh my fucking god

Oh

1584
01:49:19,820 --> 01:49:23,100

I grabbed something off the desk and it literally like opened the thing and then I got

1685
02:01:01,740 --> 02:01:02,780
Like

1686
02:01:02,780 --> 02:01:07,980
30 experience points that that's a cheat that's that's a hack in the game. It's like people don't know about it

1687
02:01:07,980 --> 02:01:09,980
It's little like it's a little bit lesser known

1688
02:01:11,660 --> 02:01:13,740
But uh, you know it is what it is, you know

1689
02:01:17,740 --> 02:01:19,740

Testing our knowledge

02:05:29,420 --> 02:05:31,420
I actually really like this part of the game

1735
02:05:33,660 --> 02:05:35,660
That's why I want to play it again

1736
02:05:35,660 --> 02:05:37,660
Again

1737
02:05:37,900 --> 02:05:41,180
Because there's there's also if you can skip this as a way to skip it

1738
02:05:41,820 --> 02:05:46,860
Not that I know I like play the game straight through but you know, so I see my next schedule

1739
02:05:50,300 --> 02:05:52,300
I'll be posting that after stream

1740
02:05:53,260 --> 02:05:55,820
Honestly, it's a lot of the same stuff I played a lot this week

02:05:58,060 --> 02:06:00,060
Yes, I can tell you now I'm playing

02:06:23,660 --> 02:06:25,660
I don't even know what bunny garden is about

1747
02:06:26,380 --> 02:06:28,380
I'm just like bunnies

1748
02:06:28,460 --> 02:06:30,460
I'm in

1749
02:06:33,100 --> 02:06:35,100
My manager sent me my schedule

1750
02:06:35,740 --> 02:06:41,100
Oh, yes, I'm doing the reading fan fiction. So please submit fan fictions to me

1751
02:06:43,260 --> 02:06:45,260
And then I also have

1752
02:06:46,860 --> 02:06:51,260
An asmr roleplay where your trash your literal trash

1753
02:06:54,700 --> 02:06:56,700
The inspiration comes from

1754
02:06:58,460 --> 02:07:04,300
Uh, I need to make a schedule folder. Let me do that right now

1755
02:07:07,100 --> 02:07:12,700
Schedules schedules actually I probably already have one. I just don't know where oh I did it's literally above it

1756
02:07:12,780 --> 02:07:17,100
I'm actually stupid. Um, it's in the vein of like a heather feather one

1757
02:07:17,660 --> 02:07:20,540
That I used to love that was like one of the first times I got tingles

1758
02:07:23,100 --> 02:07:25,100
Can I I don't know which one to delete

1759
02:07:26,060 --> 02:07:28,940
Which one's the newer one? Oh, this one's the newer one, okay

1760
02:07:30,220 --> 02:07:32,220
I can't I delete it

1761
02:07:33,900 --> 02:07:36,060
Fuck I deleted the wrong one. It's fine

1762
02:07:40,780 --> 02:07:46,540
I'm already in character. Yeah, so I'm gonna get some stuff this week probably to

1763
02:07:48,380 --> 02:07:52,700
Um get some really good triggers. I'm not gonna be as

1764
02:07:53,660 --> 02:07:55,660
As I was last time

1765
02:08:01,740 --> 02:08:08,620
This is not it hold on this isn't it. It's my old one. I'm just changing it out. Oh

1766
02:08:11,980 --> 02:08:14,300
This is my schedule you heard it here folks

1767
02:08:15,900 --> 02:08:21,500
Was that too stream reading submitted fan fictions ignore the bottom part I was like

1768
02:08:22,700 --> 02:08:24,700
Um, I'm like, um

1769
02:08:25,580 --> 02:08:29,900
Not a son you did you just put sub description or collab under

1770
02:08:31,660 --> 02:08:36,060
Manpower the masquerade bloodlines part two, so I'm waiting for them to get back to me fixing that

1771
02:08:36,700 --> 02:08:38,620
um

1772
02:08:38,620 --> 02:08:43,580
POV or trash and then yeah, so this is that that's the schedule. I'm very excited for power simulator

1773
02:08:44,380 --> 02:08:46,380
collab feet my genmeads

1774
02:08:49,100 --> 02:08:51,580
You look lonely I can fix that

1775
02:08:53,020 --> 02:08:58,300
Yeah, great art. Thank you. Um sly ukai or yuka one

1776
02:09:00,300 --> 02:09:02,300
Great

1777
02:09:02,540 --> 02:09:04,540
You wink

1778
02:09:17,900 --> 02:09:19,900
And I hope we get monetization soon

1779
02:09:23,020 --> 02:09:25,020
I

1780
02:09:26,220 --> 02:09:28,220
I'm enjoying my old twitter

1781
02:09:30,460 --> 02:09:34,380
I don't know what you're talking about what old twitter

1782
02:09:37,260 --> 02:09:40,700
Where do people submit fanfics yes in my maros you can submit it in my maros

1783
02:09:41,180 --> 02:09:47,980
Um, I want it to be in the vein of like my immortals so like super cringy really bad

1784
02:09:48,700 --> 02:09:50,700
um

1785
02:09:50,860 --> 02:09:55,740
Some people have sent me like really nice ones like really well written and I'm like no

1786
02:09:56,460 --> 02:09:57,900
I said

1787
02:09:57,900 --> 02:09:59,020
cringy

1788
02:09:59,020 --> 02:10:03,580
Tarot me me ones or even ones like you don't have to write them yourselves like like

1789
02:10:04,140 --> 02:10:08,780
If you were to write one you can make about me or my gen mates and you can make it like cringy you can self insert

1790
02:10:08,860 --> 02:10:12,300
That's fine or you can do like a your name like y slash n

1791
02:10:12,780 --> 02:10:17,900
Um, I want the cringe. I want to be like fangs because I'm gothic like my immortal type

1792
02:10:18,780 --> 02:10:22,780
And if I don't like anything that's submitted I'm probably just gonna read my immortal

1793
02:10:26,060 --> 02:10:33,500
Um, if if anyone's gonna convince youtube to want to test your channel, it's definitely you um, I'm also working on

1794
02:10:35,420 --> 02:10:37,420
Um

1795
02:10:37,500 --> 02:10:40,380
Making the first class of 9

1796
02:10:41,500 --> 02:10:45,660
Uh play through public again. I was editing it

1797
02:10:46,380 --> 02:10:51,180
Um, so that's fine. I left some funny stuff in there though. Uh, I don't know if it's processing

1798
02:10:52,140 --> 02:10:56,700
Can you submit a high sonic high school fail? I'll hunt. That's what I'm looking for. That is literally what I'm looking for

1799
02:10:56,780 --> 02:10:58,780
So that would be perfect. Um

1800
02:10:59,340 --> 02:11:03,340
So I don't I might wait till I get monetized to

1801
02:11:04,300 --> 02:11:06,300
Make it public again

1802
02:11:06,300 --> 02:11:10,220
My stream was historical. Yeah, I was rewatching it like parts of it and I was

1803
02:11:10,780 --> 02:11:12,700
cackling at myself

1804
02:11:12,700 --> 02:11:14,700
And at my ac in the background

1805
02:11:15,420 --> 02:11:18,220
Um, but yeah, I'm gonna wait

1806
02:11:19,580 --> 02:11:25,580
To get monetized before I publicize that again. It was very fun. Yes, I will definitely probably play class of 9 again

1807
02:11:26,060 --> 02:11:29,420
But that'll be like later in the future or maybe I'll do it as a gorilla sometime

1808
02:11:30,460 --> 02:11:33,660
Um, I definitely want to play a little bit of call of the lamb again

1809
02:11:34,540 --> 02:11:39,500
You know, I'll probably do another endurance stream for that. Riley. I just got another boss

1810
02:11:39,980 --> 02:11:43,020
I was like endurance stream and this like kill a boss each time

1811
02:11:43,500 --> 02:11:45,500
Or or two

1812
02:11:45,500 --> 02:11:47,500
um

1813
02:11:47,980 --> 02:11:54,060
And then like you can also like recommend me games and my murals and stuff that you'd like me to play because again like I

1814
02:11:55,020 --> 02:12:00,780
Grew up playing a lot of fps's. I'm not even good at them. Um, so I

1815
02:12:01,420 --> 02:12:05,100
I want to widen my horizons in terms of games

1816
02:12:06,060 --> 02:12:08,060
So if you have game suggestions

1817
02:12:08,940 --> 02:12:10,380
cool

1818
02:12:10,460 --> 02:12:15,500
Or I'm just gonna end up playing flavors of the month like bunny garden. I don't even know what it's about

1819
02:12:15,500 --> 02:12:17,500
I think there's like hot girls in it

1820
02:12:18,460 --> 02:12:24,540
Hopefully my character shows up for call of the lamb. Yeah, I actually really oh, I'm gonna play inscription with crowd control

1821
02:12:25,180 --> 02:12:27,420
100%

1822
02:12:27,420 --> 02:12:30,220
I'm like actually like a little bit tempted to like yoink

1823
02:12:31,180 --> 02:12:37,340
Bunny garden and do inscription with crowd control. I I really like crowd control games. Um, because I really like

1824
02:12:37,900 --> 02:12:40,860
You guys interacting. I wouldn't

1825
02:12:41,580 --> 02:12:45,180
Play through inscription. I would probably just play

1826
02:12:45,900 --> 02:12:47,900
the first part

1827
02:12:47,900 --> 02:12:49,340
um

1828
02:12:49,340 --> 02:12:54,460
Just because the game is like I I've finished inscription before it's literally one of my favorite games of all time

1829
02:12:55,660 --> 02:12:56,860
um

1830
02:12:56,860 --> 02:13:02,220
Like the first part is like the best and then the second part's like a little bit confusing and was really frustrating for me to get through

1831
02:13:02,780 --> 02:13:04,300
the part with

1832
02:13:04,380 --> 02:13:08,540
Robot version is good and then the parts after that are like, okay, so, um

1833
02:13:10,780 --> 02:13:13,660
I really like you guys nice to get free bro wrong

1834
02:13:15,660 --> 02:13:19,900
But you don't you don't want to be my boyfriend girlfriend. You want to be my boyfriend girlfriend girlfriend boyfriend

1835
02:13:20,700 --> 02:13:22,700
What's up? What's up? What's up? What's up?

1836
02:13:24,380 --> 02:13:26,380
Um

1837
02:13:26,380 --> 02:13:29,980
Bolivian is going to bucket list. Uh, I'm pretty sure

1838
02:13:31,180 --> 02:13:33,500
Strawny's playing skyrim next week

1839
02:13:34,300 --> 02:13:39,820
So I probably wait a little bit like a couple months. I do before I play skyrim

1840
02:13:40,380 --> 02:13:42,380
um

1841
02:13:43,020 --> 02:13:45,500
I have a bolivian. I could probably play a bolivian

1842
02:13:46,460 --> 02:13:52,060
Um, I only did a little bit of bolivian before has crowd control work. It's pretty cool because um

1843
02:13:52,860 --> 02:13:58,380
You guys get like coins and like sometimes like you can purchase coins if you want you guys don't have to

1844
02:13:58,700 --> 02:14:02,780
I'm trying to figure it out. So you guys don't like can you get more free coins to mess around with stuff?

1845
02:14:05,340 --> 02:14:06,780
And uh

1846
02:14:06,780 --> 02:14:08,940
You can control aspects of my stream

1847
02:14:09,900 --> 02:14:14,620
And like my gameplay and I that's why I like I think like for example with the description because it's like

1848
02:14:15,020 --> 02:14:17,660
It's almost like hearthstone or it's like it's a card game and stuff

1849
02:14:18,060 --> 02:14:24,540
Um, you just like make my hand all bees or whatever instead of like me having like a more boris or something

1850
02:14:24,620 --> 02:14:29,180
So I think that would be really fun. Um, that's why I only want to do like the first part because I know you guys like I

1851
02:14:30,460 --> 02:14:33,020
Like I fucking love inscription. Um

1852
02:14:34,220 --> 02:14:38,140
I want to play pony island 2 when it comes out because I play pony island

1853
02:14:39,340 --> 02:14:44,780
Could you make everything just one coin or something? No, that'd be too easy. Are you kidding? So you want to do? Hold on, let me just

1854
02:14:46,300 --> 02:14:50,140
Like weird weird angle since you want to do more of a variety of games

1855
02:14:50,220 --> 02:14:53,740
I've thought about trying out rts or turn based strategy games

1856
02:14:54,940 --> 02:14:56,940
Give me an example of that

1857
02:14:57,580 --> 02:14:59,580
and I have

1858
02:14:59,580 --> 02:15:01,820
Like done the beam out of four and it was pretty good

1859
02:15:03,180 --> 02:15:05,180
One coin would be chaos

1860
02:15:05,420 --> 02:15:11,020
Um, but I'll I'll probably like look through some of the crowd control games and like get a couple

1861
02:15:11,900 --> 02:15:13,260
balder's gate

1862
02:15:13,260 --> 02:15:15,260
I like fire emblem three houses

1863
02:15:17,740 --> 02:15:19,740
He he he um

1864
02:15:20,620 --> 02:15:22,540
Because I like

1865
02:15:22,540 --> 02:15:24,220
The romancing in the story

1866
02:15:24,220 --> 02:15:29,180
Oh, yeah, I definitely want to play hades because people have suggested hades. It's like yeah, I turned off martyr the lamb

1867
02:15:29,900 --> 02:15:30,860
um

1868
02:15:30,860 --> 02:15:32,860
balder's gate

1869
02:15:33,820 --> 02:15:35,420
I'm not

1870
02:15:35,420 --> 02:15:37,820
I'm kind of impatient when it comes to those games

1871
02:15:37,820 --> 02:15:45,100
I don't I'm not a huge fan of turn based games, but fire emblem three houses, which was the first fire emblem game I played kind of

1872
02:15:46,060 --> 02:15:50,140
Um, and then I played a little bit of like the one that Iksen that I can't remember the top of my head

1873
02:15:50,620 --> 02:15:53,180
Um, and I do like it, but it just

1874
02:15:55,420 --> 02:15:59,660
I'd have to because like I have but I literally have balder's gate on my playstation

1875
02:16:00,140 --> 02:16:02,140
I only played like three hours of it though

1876
02:16:03,820 --> 02:16:05,820
Yes, I play pathically a little bit of pathoradians

1877
02:16:06,380 --> 02:16:07,740
um

1878
02:16:07,740 --> 02:16:11,980
I'd play diablo like that would be cool. I'll like I'll play diablo. I actually like diablo

1879
02:16:12,540 --> 02:16:14,300
um

1880
02:16:14,300 --> 02:16:19,260
But maybe balder's gate and I also don't know if my pc would be able to handle balder's gate because it's like pretty

1881
02:16:19,820 --> 02:16:24,140
Intensive I have slay the princess. I would I would totally play slay the princess

1882
02:16:24,940 --> 02:16:27,820
uh, I used to play warframe a lot when

1883
02:16:29,100 --> 02:16:30,220
um

1884
02:16:30,220 --> 02:16:33,580
I needed a titanfall fix and like I don't think destiny was a thing yet

1885
02:16:35,020 --> 02:16:37,500
I'm a awakening figure it on me like oh, I mean

1886
02:16:38,620 --> 02:16:40,380
I don't need one of those

1887
02:16:40,380 --> 02:16:45,100
I have a capture card and I have every game console. Let me talk about

1888
02:16:46,060 --> 02:16:49,180
Warframe at the harem. I don't know if I would play warframe again though

1889
02:16:51,980 --> 02:16:53,980
I haven't touched that game and like

1890
02:16:54,620 --> 02:16:58,460
To 3d yet. Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. Don't worry about 3ds style

1891
02:16:59,420 --> 02:17:03,020
I can make it run on the 3ds and hook it up to my computer

1892
02:17:03,900 --> 02:17:05,020
fashion frame

1893
02:17:05,020 --> 02:17:07,340
uh, I remember I used to just focus in all the

1894
02:17:07,980 --> 02:17:11,180
The outfits in that game. I was like full pearl pink or whatever

1895
02:17:11,740 --> 02:17:13,580
um

1896
02:17:13,580 --> 02:17:16,700
I haven't touched that game in like so fucking long

1897
02:17:17,500 --> 02:17:19,500
subverse. I don't know what that is

1898
02:17:20,300 --> 02:17:22,300
Three houses or nothing

1899
02:17:23,340 --> 02:17:27,660
You got tired of war. Yeah warframe was super grindy like I don't mind grindy games

1900
02:17:27,740 --> 02:17:33,100
Like I played the shit out of destiny 2 and destiny 1 those things, you know around

1901
02:17:35,500 --> 02:17:41,500
And I know like like I'm notorious for starting games and not finishing them like games really have to capture my attention

1902
02:17:42,220 --> 02:17:44,380
like

1903
02:17:44,380 --> 02:17:46,620
That's why I like inscription and call the lamb

1904
02:17:47,580 --> 02:17:50,140
If they're in the same vein as that I'll probably really like it

1905
02:17:51,180 --> 02:17:55,980
Uh, it's an at plus game. Oh, yeah, I want to play hoony pop when we eventually get our fanslies

1906
02:17:56,940 --> 02:17:59,740
That'd be so fun because I've been playing a lot of match three games

1907
02:18:01,820 --> 02:18:03,820
I've yeah, I've been recommended hall and I before

1908
02:18:04,700 --> 02:18:12,060
Um, I know that people are like bummed or whatever that there's not a like the another game hasn't come out

1909
02:18:12,060 --> 02:18:14,060
I can't remember

1910
02:18:15,260 --> 02:18:17,260
Um

1911
02:18:17,820 --> 02:18:23,580
Having awful I still yeah, I I want I played the most recent diablo and I really I played it for like a pretty long time

1912
02:18:24,540 --> 02:18:28,780
I don't even remember what level I am and then I guess got distracted by other stuff

1913
02:18:31,820 --> 02:18:33,820
Dead cell no

1914

2019
02:26:40,140 --> 02:26:44,300
Of titanfall when you're in the mech. I fucking love titanfall and I miss this so much

2020
02:26:44,380 --> 02:26:49,660
I fucking hate apex legends so much fuck apex legends. You took away titanfall 3 for me

2021
02:26:50,700 --> 02:26:52,540
I hope the game

2022
02:26:52,540 --> 02:26:54,540

2023
02:26:56,620 --> 02:26:58,620

Oh, shout out the retreat June 20. Sorry, that was like a my recommended

2026
02:27:15,260 --> 02:27:19,740
I don't think titanfall 3 is ever gonna happen. Remember it takes July 5th 1921

2027
02:27:21,420 --> 02:27:23,420
It's pretty hard

2028
02:27:24,380 --> 02:27:27,020
Could you stream of titanfall 2? Yeah, I can do that

2029
02:27:31,580 --> 02:27:33,580
I

2030
02:27:35,100 --> 02:27:38,620
I repeat titanfall I love multiplayer like I would oh like

2031
02:27:42,460 --> 02:27:48,380
Like that in destiny were the only like fps games that was actually good at and I would usually be a top frag

2032
02:27:49,740 --> 02:27:52,620
If it's caught I'm just like kind of there. I'm like kind of in the middle

2033
02:28:01,340 --> 02:28:06,060
Titanfall come out at the same time as half life 3 don't call us suckers

2034
02:28:07,260 --> 02:28:09,260
God boo

2035
02:28:09,900 --> 02:28:13,020
I just like the wall running. I know it's such a cool feature in titanfall

2036
02:28:14,380 --> 02:28:17,740
I'm so guys they're not gonna do titanfall 3 apex legends

2037
02:28:19,260 --> 02:28:25,100
Is just like a the like a little piggy bank for them full of money. They don't need to make titanfall 3

2038
02:28:25,980 --> 02:28:33,180
You all did get alex that's true you got alex

2039
02:28:38,380 --> 02:28:40,380
I want to be held and

2040
02:28:40,460 --> 02:28:42,460
Cradled by my titan daddy

2041
02:28:43,740 --> 02:28:49,260
Apex is the font titanfall 3. You'll see I wish though. I know I think they're adding

2042
02:28:50,060 --> 02:28:53,580
I think there was like whispers of them adding one of the titans

2043
02:28:55,420 --> 02:28:56,700
In the game

2044
02:28:56,700 --> 02:28:58,220
In apex

2045
02:28:58,220 --> 02:28:59,740
as something

2046
02:28:59,740 --> 02:29:05,820
And could probably fill a titanfall 2 lobby of playing with viewers. Yeah, but like the game is so fucking I think it's like super

2047
02:29:06,460 --> 02:29:07,820
buggy

2048
02:29:07,820 --> 02:29:11,020
And hacky and isn't right like multiplayer doesn't load properly

2049
02:29:14,140 --> 02:29:16,140
I'm often coping over here

2050
02:29:18,940 --> 02:29:20,940
Oh my god

2051
02:29:20,940 --> 02:29:22,940
Loud neighbors again

2052
02:29:23,260 --> 02:29:25,260
Angel city is an apex map. Oh

2053
02:29:25,900 --> 02:29:26,700
I

2054
02:29:26,700 --> 02:29:32,380
Angel city was one of my favorite maps if they added like it'd be so fucking easy to add titanfall maps

2055
02:29:33,980 --> 02:29:38,140
To apex I would play I would I won't lie. I'll play if they added

2056
02:29:38,860 --> 02:29:40,860
titanfall maps

2057
02:29:42,140 --> 02:29:45,980
I would they'd rather make apex legends 2 than titanfall 3. I know it fucking sucks

2058
02:29:50,700 --> 02:29:52,700
Or this they might be

2059
02:29:53,660 --> 02:29:57,180
Beautiful lady tell me do you have a dream and what is it?

2060
02:29:57,660 --> 02:30:02,940
Mine is very simple to be as close as the man in the picture on my profile's possible with life and love

2061
02:30:05,340 --> 02:30:07,340

2103
02:42:31,500 --> 02:42:33,500

Any of those five target star weapons or characters like I tried playing honkai star rail and I was bored

2123
02:43:57,820 --> 02:43:59,580
is that

2124
02:43:59,580 --> 02:44:01,580
Is that a hot take

2125
02:44:06,140 --> 02:44:10,380
Fuck what is this where did it go did my thing crash?

2126
02:44:13,820 --> 02:44:15,820
Oh, yeah

2127
02:44:16,780 --> 02:44:19,420
It's like new food places going up near me

2128
02:44:22,060 --> 02:44:23,260
So I opened

2129
02:44:23,260 --> 02:44:28,860
Google on my phone and the first thing I see is the kirby gift of him like sucking somebody's arm that I posted on strani

2130
02:44:29,580 --> 02:44:31,180
thing

2131
02:44:31,180 --> 02:44:33,900
If any be honest, I'm more tan on my legs than you and I'm full

2132
02:44:35,900 --> 02:44:42,220
Listen, I haven't been outside in a very long time if you saw my face in my hair you'd be like, okay, she's brown

2133
02:44:43,180 --> 02:44:46,540
But if you any other aspect of my body is white woman jumpscare

2134
02:44:50,300 --> 02:44:52,300
Honkai was was me

2135
02:44:52,620 --> 02:44:56,380
I don't really know if you squint after playing genshin weathering waves

2136
02:44:56,860 --> 02:45:01,580
I thought weathering waves was like a book title, but I was like getting used to the weathering heights

2137
02:45:02,700 --> 02:45:05,340
Honkai and azur lane together you see don't well. Yeah, they're all

2138
02:45:05,980 --> 02:45:07,980
You can see these different settings

2139
02:45:08,220 --> 02:45:11,980
What did even I don't even I just discovered weather weathering waves like

2140
02:45:12,620 --> 02:45:16,460
Two days ago or whatever the fuck early a couple of days ago, and I'm like, where did this come from?

2141
02:45:17,980 --> 02:45:19,980
What the heck happened

2142
02:45:19,980 --> 02:45:21,980
Kirby is canonically a cosmic horror

2143
02:45:22,860 --> 02:45:24,860
I believe that

2144
02:45:25,580 --> 02:45:31,280
You are so real for posting that kirby gift. Thank you. Do you guys pronounce it gif or jiff?

2145
02:45:37,980 --> 02:45:39,980
I

2146
02:45:44,700 --> 02:45:46,700
Hard g

2147
02:45:49,740 --> 02:45:54,300
I like how you guys are just spelling out gif and like not being like

2148
02:45:56,220 --> 02:45:59,980
Gif or okay, well if you spell gif like the peanut butter that does make it more sense

2149
02:46:00,860 --> 02:46:02,860
Gif I actually I think I like

2150
02:46:03,180 --> 02:46:05,180

02:46:09,500 --> 02:46:11,900

02:46:18,460 --> 02:46:20,460
I'm sorry that'd be like this is a fucking

2155
02:46:21,020 --> 02:46:23,420
Funny as comic like these two guys

2156
02:46:24,140 --> 02:46:26,140
Like arguing over stuff

2157
02:46:26,460 --> 02:46:33,580
Like it's gif no it's gif and then it's like a furry just like bust out the door and be like gif and it's like heavily demonic

2158
02:46:35,820 --> 02:46:37,820
I

2159
02:46:39,420 --> 02:46:41,420

2162
02:47:01,500 --> 02:47:03,500
That's why I didn't work

2163
02:47:03,820 --> 02:47:06,940
Guys I'm gonna cry. I really wanted a burrito from this place

2164
02:47:09,180 --> 02:47:11,180
What should I get instead?

2165
02:47:11,980 --> 02:47:16,140
Here I'm gonna look at you again. What should I get instead? I'm holding you in my lap

2166
02:47:18,380 --> 02:47:20,380

2169
02:47:33,500 --> 02:47:35,500
I

2170
02:47:36,540 --> 02:47:38,540
Who am I fighting

2171
02:47:41,580 --> 02:47:43,580
Taco bill sinabon the lights

2172
02:47:43,900 --> 02:47:49,100
I actually trifles for the first time like a week or so ago because I didn't have

2173
02:47:49,660 --> 02:47:54,380
Um I didn't go grocery shopping. So I just ended up ordering taco bill and I had one bite of those

2174
02:47:54,460 --> 02:47:58,060
I want and I'm like no thank you. It tastes like greasy cream cheese

2175
02:47:58,380 --> 02:48:02,220
I was I was okay with that. I didn't even eat them. It was a waste of money. I'm sorry

2176
02:48:04,460 --> 02:48:07,660
People take gif versus gif. What's another thing people like

2177
02:48:09,180 --> 02:48:14,860
Like oh is a hot dog a sandwich? That's my favorite. What do you guys is a hot dog? It's all we're gonna put it to a poll

2178
02:48:17,260 --> 02:48:19,260
Sorry you guys are dropped in my lap

2179
02:48:21,980 --> 02:48:26,780
Is a hot dog a sandwich me personally it's a taco

2180
02:48:26,780 --> 02:48:33,180
Is cereal soup yes

2181
02:48:34,860 --> 02:48:36,860
Smell the ice cream soup yes

2182
02:48:39,020 --> 02:48:41,020
Is water wet

2183
02:48:42,780 --> 02:48:44,780
I have to think about that one

2184
02:48:47,340 --> 02:48:49,740
Um a ravioli is just an empanada

2185
02:48:49,740 --> 02:48:51,740
I

2186
02:48:56,620 --> 02:49:00,460
No, I ain't never had a real taco everything hot no hot dog is a taco 100%

2187
02:49:01,980 --> 02:49:03,980
Is whiskey catch what?

2188
02:49:06,380 --> 02:49:10,700
Cereal first I'm not a sociopath you leave empanadas out of this

2189
02:49:12,460 --> 02:49:14,460
Is pizza an open-face sandwich hmm

2190
02:49:16,620 --> 02:49:18,620
Legally a hot dog is a sandwich

2191
02:49:19,900 --> 02:49:23,580
Hot dog is a sandwich if you need to specify the kind of sandwich

2192
02:49:25,020 --> 02:49:27,020
Uh, I think a hot dog is a kind of taco

2193
02:49:28,380 --> 02:49:30,380
Water with cereal what are you fucking on

2194
02:49:32,220 --> 02:49:37,500
Hot dog is a taco and tacos are sandwich no no no no no you got it all wrong

2195
02:49:38,380 --> 02:49:41,740
Is a calzone an empanada yes just an italian empanada

2196
02:49:43,180 --> 02:49:45,340
Water makes things wet, but it's not what itself, but

2197
02:49:46,780 --> 02:49:48,780
but

2198
02:49:49,100 --> 02:49:52,700
If water makes things wet and water

2199
02:49:55,500 --> 02:50:02,620
What did I ever get what the fucking we're gonna say if water makes things wet because it's wet that just answers the question itself

2200
02:50:04,060 --> 02:50:06,060
Water's wet because it makes things wet

2201
02:50:10,220 --> 02:50:13,260
Can water be dry I think actually technically

2202
02:50:14,220 --> 02:50:19,100
In a different form maybe I don't know water what's water there you go

2203
02:50:21,420 --> 02:50:26,700
Auto's neutral state is wet you know what also who's neutral state is wet your mom

2208
02:50:44,620 --> 02:50:46,620
Okay, now I have to find another place to eat

2209
02:50:48,300 --> 02:50:50,300
Fucking hate it here

2210
02:50:52,700 --> 02:50:54,700
Uh

2211
02:50:54,700 --> 02:50:56,700
There's another

2212
02:50:56,700 --> 02:50:58,700
taqueria

2213
02:50:58,700 --> 02:51:00,700
And I wanted that taqueria

2214
02:51:02,700 --> 02:51:04,700
I could order sushi

2215
02:51:10,300 --> 02:51:13,340
I haven't had sushi in a long time now I think of about it

2216
02:51:21,260 --> 02:51:27,340
Water is a tech why am I just like how my model froze um sushi's how expensive though yeah you're right

2217
02:51:29,900 --> 02:51:31,580
She ate it

2218
02:51:31,580 --> 02:51:33,980
I just finished my sashimi and now I want more yeah

2219
02:51:33,980 --> 02:51:39,660
I'd like sushi always doesn't like really fill me unless I have like like a couple rolls and I and then it'll just be expensive

2220
02:51:42,460 --> 02:51:44,460
I guess I'll starve

2221
02:51:44,940 --> 02:51:46,940
Because I am indecisive as hell

2222
02:51:47,340 --> 02:51:49,340
What do I have in the fridge?

2223
02:51:49,740 --> 02:51:55,260
I have chicken tendis frozen. I have salmon frozen

2224
02:51:56,940 --> 02:51:58,940
I have

2225
02:52:00,380 --> 02:52:02,380
My headphones just shut off

2226
02:52:04,860 --> 02:52:06,860
I

2227
02:52:08,460 --> 02:52:10,460
Don't know

2228
02:52:11,100 --> 02:52:14,460
Definitely need to charge them. Um, oh, I forgot I looked at candle burning

2229
02:52:19,740 --> 02:52:21,740
Okay, I can't blow from there, um

2230
02:52:22,860 --> 02:52:24,860
Just came out from all you eat sushi place

2231
02:52:25,420 --> 02:52:27,420
I don't fairly think I have any of those around here

2232
02:52:28,860 --> 02:52:32,140
There's literally just like a bunch of spanish food trucks around

2233
02:52:34,780 --> 02:52:38,220
And get chilies welcome to chilies

2234
02:52:41,260 --> 02:52:44,060
Greek food oh I could fuck up some chicken shawarma

2235
02:52:45,980 --> 02:52:47,980
Chawarma

2236
02:52:49,500 --> 02:52:52,460
Pasta places that's true that would fill me up

2237
02:52:53,260 --> 02:52:57,500
There's an olive garden nearby on crustables. I think I have one on crustable left

2238
02:52:59,260 --> 02:53:01,260
You can unfroze them in the microwave Ernest

2239
02:53:04,220 --> 02:53:06,220
You

2240
02:53:06,780 --> 02:53:10,780
You put them in the microwave or a stove? Hold on

2241
02:53:13,500 --> 02:53:15,500
What the fuck is wrong with you?

2242
02:53:17,820 --> 02:53:21,980
You defrost on crustables in a microwave or a fucking stove?

2243
02:53:23,980 --> 02:53:27,820
What the fuck are you on? You fucked in the head

2244
02:53:29,900 --> 02:53:31,900
You good

2245
02:53:34,460 --> 02:53:38,700
Just leave them out. You just leave them out to defrost your fucking psychopath

2246
02:53:40,300 --> 02:53:42,300
Jesus christ

2247
02:53:43,900 --> 02:53:45,900
God damn it. I can't even look at you

2248

i love a woman that can destroy food to be honest it's funny because like i remember

2504
03:19:30,360 --> 03:19:39,400
i like had my so like my friend went on a date and um i was like lingering nearby

2505
03:19:39,400 --> 03:19:46,600
because i was like worried for her deeply and um because you know you can't trust these these places

2506
03:19:46,600 --> 03:19:53,480
these sites and the guy walked out on her because she ordered food

2507
03:19:56,040 --> 03:20:03,160
like she ordered like a normal amount of food like she ordered like entree appetizer a drink

2508
03:20:05,720 --> 03:20:10,360
and then i like talked to her afterwards because i was like fucking off somewhere else

2509
03:20:10,360 --> 03:20:15,240
with our other friends because it wasn't just me it was more than um did your food no i haven't yet

2510
03:20:15,240 --> 03:20:20,440
i still haven't thought of anything um we were like eating someplace nearby me and our friends

2511
03:20:21,160 --> 03:20:30,840
and we're like oh redacted what happened and she's just like he said i was like not like he didn't

2512
03:20:30,840 --> 03:20:37,400
like directly call her a pig from what she was saying but like he kind of like insinuated she

2513
03:20:37,400 --> 03:20:44,440
wasn't like ladylike because she got so much food and we're like me and the other girls are like

2514
03:20:44,440 --> 03:20:46,200
we'll fuck him anyways margaritas

2515
03:20:51,000 --> 03:20:57,480
so he got mad because she i don't like did like i'm like did you order something expensive

2516
03:20:57,480 --> 03:21:03,800
and she's like no i just like got a burger and i'm like okay did he wink at her oh my god that's so

2517
03:21:03,800 --> 03:21:11,800
fucked um but well it like it sucked because like he left and so she paid for both their meals

2518
03:21:11,800 --> 03:21:17,400
and so like me and the other girls we like took her out and she didn't have to

2519
03:21:18,040 --> 03:21:24,360
to spend any money because like that's so fucked yeah he did the the dip

2520
03:21:26,440 --> 03:21:30,680
none of us fucking noticed either we're like really bad not sticking stuff out we're not reliable

2521
03:21:34,200 --> 03:21:38,280
ah the napsel she'll have the salad literally i think that's what he expected her to get like a salad

2522
03:21:38,280 --> 03:21:45,560
and like she's like a normal sized girl too like she's not like heavy she's not super skinny

2523
03:21:46,520 --> 03:21:50,360
but she she's like literally the most normal looking girl you could ever see

2524
03:21:52,360 --> 03:21:56,360
but he every day he could have been just like fuck like i don't know he could have been like

2525
03:21:56,360 --> 03:22:01,080
pulling uh like a fast one on her like to get free food i don't fucking know

2526
03:22:03,480 --> 03:22:05,400
you got your back see something shiny literally though

2527
03:22:09,160 --> 03:22:11,960
because we were we were enjoying our own food down the street someplace else

2528
03:22:17,880 --> 03:22:19,080
you just need an excuse to dip

2529
03:22:21,480 --> 03:22:27,720
guys i don't want to get okay fuck it i'm gonna order for i'm kind of wanting something soupy

2530
03:22:39,000 --> 03:22:47,000
the girl invited me on a date and it's a korean barbecue to the keeper

2531
03:22:47,720 --> 03:22:51,560
there's like no korean barbecue places near me i've never had korean barbecue in my life

2532
03:22:53,400 --> 03:22:54,360
i heard it's really good

2533
03:22:57,400 --> 03:23:00,520
the way he thought he could have still free meal unless he was trying to split something

2534
03:23:02,760 --> 03:23:05,560
fuck it you're missing out you know

2535
03:23:08,440 --> 03:23:08,840
okay

2536
03:23:12,360 --> 03:23:15,400
i like this has oxtail

2537
03:23:18,200 --> 03:23:20,840
steak and flank so that's kind of fine

2538
03:23:25,160 --> 03:23:29,240
it comes with hoisin sauce and sriracha should i get

2539
03:23:31,080 --> 03:23:33,480
i'm not what's fish i've never had knock mom

2540
03:23:38,920 --> 03:23:42,440
chili oil i have some chili oil in my fridge so i don't like it by chili oil

2541
03:23:43,320 --> 03:23:46,120
or some wagyu beef i've had wagyu beef one time

2542
03:23:47,880 --> 03:23:51,800
and it was very underwhelming i got at this really nice restaurant

2543
03:23:52,440 --> 03:24:00,280
my parents were um celebrating a uh like a the fuck what was it

2544
03:24:01,480 --> 03:24:07,560
what's the word i wasn't a raise a promotion i got and we ordered like this wagyu sushi

2545
03:24:08,760 --> 03:24:16,520
and it didn't taste like anything but except like they added like a lot of like decorative

2546
03:24:17,400 --> 03:24:19,560
flowers to it so it just tastes like burnt flowers

2547
03:24:22,040 --> 03:24:23,320
like a sweet sour sauce

2548
03:24:26,120 --> 03:24:27,160
meat sweats for these

2549
03:24:29,320 --> 03:24:31,480
tartar no it wasn't like a tartar

2550
03:24:33,320 --> 03:24:33,800
i don't know

2551
03:24:35,560 --> 03:24:37,240
wagyu sushi yeah it was like

2552
03:24:38,440 --> 03:24:39,480
topped with wagyu

2553
03:24:43,240 --> 03:24:44,760
a minute order some spring rolls

2554
03:24:53,080 --> 03:24:55,400
like others just turn into a fucking zatsu

2555
03:24:59,000 --> 03:25:03,480
wagyu coming yeah it was like topped with like wagyu on and it was pretty good

2556
03:25:04,040 --> 03:25:08,040
super inconsistent it was like you just got scammed maybe probably

2557
03:25:09,400 --> 03:25:11,960
i'd show a picture but then you guys probably like hunt down the place

2558
03:25:13,800 --> 03:25:16,680
because it looked amazing it did not taste good at all it was a waste of money

2559
03:25:17,480 --> 03:25:21,000
and it was like 30 bucks no it was more than that

2560
03:25:22,520 --> 03:25:23,960
it was like 50 bucks for the roll

2561
03:25:27,880 --> 03:25:32,920
american japanese wagyu it was like a fusion restaurant and they had said it was japanese

2562
03:25:33,000 --> 03:25:34,680
wagyu i know american is different

2563
03:25:37,800 --> 03:25:41,000
but you know maybe one day i'll off-cloud with the girls when we're like go to japan

2564
03:25:41,000 --> 03:25:44,760

2571
03:26:39,720 --> 03:26:44,440
um like strawberry legs or whatever it's called

2572
03:26:46,600 --> 03:26:49,000
uh where you just get like you can kind of see like

2573
03:26:50,280 --> 03:26:52,920
your skin is like thin enough you can almost see where the hair would grow

2574
03:26:53,800 --> 03:26:57,640
keratosis polaris yeah strawberry skin yeah like i have strawberry skin

2575
03:26:59,320 --> 03:27:02,680

2576
03:27:02,680 --> 03:27:06,440
be like oh wow her skin is so sooky smooth don't believe anything you see on the internet

2577

2581
03:27:36,600 --> 03:27:39,480
hold on i'm i'm so tempted like it's really hard

2582
03:27:41,080 --> 03:27:46,040
like people will send like i know that's probably like the more intentional being like me

2583
03:27:46,040 --> 03:27:50,440
and they're like generally curious like they said um or people will send like troll stuff in my maros

2584
03:27:51,320 --> 03:27:56,840
and it's like if i have to fight the urge to troll people back so often

2585
03:27:59,800 --> 03:28:03,240
like you know people try to like dom me in my maros or whatever

2586
03:28:04,040 --> 03:28:05,160
and i just want to be like

2587
03:28:08,280 --> 03:28:16,120
i just want to just like make fun of them but i'm like no don't do it don't feed the trolls she be

2588
03:28:20,440 --> 03:28:24,120
she really is trolling keep into the wall i did that before and it

2589
03:28:26,200 --> 03:28:31,880

2590
03:28:34,520 --> 03:28:34,920

50 000 people show up on maros calling me the unordered or something um

2600
03:29:28,600 --> 03:29:33,240

04:16:48,520 --> 04:16:51,520
I have a dual feeder, and then I have another feeder in the other room.

2968
04:16:51,520 --> 04:16:54,520
And Phi is patiently waiting for the one in the other room.

2969
04:16:59,520 --> 04:17:00,520
Okay.

2970
04:17:04,520 --> 04:17:06,520
Streaming for another 10 hours stream.

2971
04:17:06,520 --> 04:17:08,520
How long have I been streaming for?

2972
04:17:09,520 --> 04:17:16,520
I'm also like, I'm streaming a lot because I know I won't be able to stream as much when I go back to work.

2973
04:17:16,520 --> 04:17:18,520
So I'm just wanting to stream as much as possible.

2974
04:17:22,520 --> 04:17:24,520
Did they put any noodles in here?

2975
04:17:24,520 --> 04:17:25,520
Okay.

2976
04:17:25,520 --> 04:17:27,520
There's not a lot of meat in here though.

2977
04:17:27,520 --> 04:17:29,520
I'm kind of bummed.

2978
04:17:29,520 --> 04:17:33,520
It said oxtail, there's no oxtail in here.

2979
04:17:34,520 --> 04:17:36,520
It's only like steak and flank.

2980
04:17:37,520 --> 04:17:38,520
Whatever.

2981
04:17:38,520 --> 04:17:39,520
5 hours?

2982
04:17:39,520 --> 04:17:40,520
Oh, okay.

2983
04:17:44,520 --> 04:17:49,520
Pineapple pizza that I make, I get some white alfredo sauce, salami, ham, pineapple, red onions.

2984
04:17:49,520 --> 04:17:50,520
Ooh, some barbecue sauce.

2985
04:17:50,520 --> 04:17:52,520
I recommend hot honey.

2986
04:17:53,520 --> 04:17:59,520
I've had, I went to this, like, I can't remember what the brand of the place is called, but they put hot honey on it.

2987
04:18:01,520 --> 04:18:02,520
3 a.m. for you.

2988
04:18:02,520 --> 04:18:04,520
Go to sleep.

2989
04:18:04,520 --> 04:18:05,520
Have a good one.

2990
04:18:05,520 --> 04:18:06,520
Oh, this is hot.

2991
04:18:06,520 --> 04:18:07,520
I can't really.

2992
04:18:11,520 --> 04:18:13,520
I just burned myself a little bit.

2993
04:18:17,520 --> 04:18:18,520
There's like, blade's pizza.

2994
04:18:18,520 --> 04:18:19,520
Maybe it was.

2995
04:18:19,520 --> 04:18:20,520
I don't know.

2996
04:18:21,520 --> 04:18:22,520
Blade's pizza's pretty good.

2997
04:18:27,520 --> 04:18:28,520
Ooh, baby.

2998
04:18:36,520 --> 04:18:37,520
May tacos?

2999
04:18:37,520 --> 04:18:38,520
Ooh.

3000
04:18:39,520 --> 04:18:40,520
My leash.

3001
04:18:40,520 --> 04:18:41,520
I require sustenance.

3002
04:18:41,520 --> 04:18:43,520
The food and bowl is already 5 minutes old.

3003
04:18:43,520 --> 04:18:44,520
Honestly, that's how Reina is.

3004
04:18:44,520 --> 04:18:46,520
Reina's a very picky eater.

3005
04:18:50,520 --> 04:18:51,520
I don't blame her though.

3006
04:18:51,520 --> 04:18:52,520
She's 14.

3007
04:18:52,520 --> 04:18:55,520
She deserves to be picky at her age.

3008
04:18:57,520 --> 04:19:01,520
She has kidney disease, so normally her thing is really low protein.

3009
04:19:02,520 --> 04:19:04,520
Sometimes I give her a little treat and I give her, like, wet food.

3010
04:19:05,520 --> 04:19:06,520
That's, like, mostly protein.

3011
04:19:08,520 --> 04:19:09,520
She likes it a lot.

3012
04:19:10,520 --> 04:19:12,520
Because honestly, at her age, I just want her to be happy.

3013
04:19:15,520 --> 04:19:16,520
And, you know, eat.

3014
04:19:20,520 --> 04:19:21,520
Have you worked at Blade's Pizza?

3015
04:19:21,520 --> 04:19:22,520
Oh, that's cool.

3016
04:19:22,520 --> 04:19:24,520
I've never worked in fast food.

3017
04:19:27,520 --> 04:19:29,520
Gotta squeeze a little bit of lime in here.

3018
04:19:30,520 --> 04:19:31,520
Be pampered.

3019
04:19:31,520 --> 04:19:33,520
Yeah, I pamper her so much.

3020
04:19:33,520 --> 04:19:35,520
My cousin came over in my apartment once.

3021
04:19:36,520 --> 04:19:38,520
And, like, I love, like, so much cat shit everywhere.

3022
04:19:38,520 --> 04:19:41,520
And, like, the cats have really nice water fountains and automatic feeders.

3023
04:19:41,520 --> 04:19:43,520
And she's like, do they live in a fucking five-star hotel?

3024
04:19:43,520 --> 04:19:45,520
And I'm like, oh, I guess so.

3025
04:19:49,520 --> 04:19:50,520
Okay, I got that.

3026
04:19:50,520 --> 04:19:53,520
They used to put the sauces in, like, little containers.

3027
04:19:53,520 --> 04:19:54,520
And now they don't.

3028
04:19:54,520 --> 04:19:56,520
And then you just have to, like...

3029
04:19:56,520 --> 04:19:57,520
Like, how am I supposed to...

3030
04:19:57,520 --> 04:19:59,520
I like to, like, take, um...

3031
04:19:59,520 --> 04:20:01,520
Did they even eat chopsticks?

3032
04:20:02,520 --> 04:20:03,520
Okay, they did.

3033
04:20:11,520 --> 04:20:13,520
Chibi's cats are Wonderland VIPs.

3034
04:20:14,520 --> 04:20:17,520
Oh, it'd be so cool if I could get them in, like, some art.

3035
04:20:17,520 --> 04:20:20,520
And, like, in the background or, like, sitting on my desk.

3036
04:20:20,520 --> 04:20:22,520
And I'm, like, very, like, evil-looking.

3037
04:20:22,520 --> 04:20:24,520
And I'm just like, I've been expecting you.

3038
04:20:24,520 --> 04:20:25,520
Harim.

3039
04:20:25,520 --> 04:20:26,520
Harim.

3040
04:20:29,520 --> 04:20:30,520
Took an app.

3041
04:20:30,520 --> 04:20:31,520
You're still streaming?

3042
04:20:31,520 --> 04:20:33,520
Is this endurance streaming?

3043
04:20:33,520 --> 04:20:34,520
I just, like, streaming for a piece of time,

3044
04:20:34,520 --> 04:20:36,520
because I don't have anything else to do.

3045
04:20:36,520 --> 04:20:40,520
Although I could, like, play or, like, watch something.

3046
04:20:43,520 --> 04:20:44,520
Shari, like, messes me.

3047
04:20:44,520 --> 04:20:46,520
She's like, I'm so proud of you, my daughter.

3048
04:20:46,520 --> 04:20:47,520
You're just, like, mommy.

3049
04:20:47,520 --> 04:20:50,520
And I'm like, I don't even know if this is because of the endurance streaming.

3050
04:20:51,520 --> 04:20:53,520
I'm not sure if it's because of the cat.

3051
04:20:53,520 --> 04:20:54,520
Yeah.

3052
04:21:05,520 --> 04:21:06,520
Hello, very much, how are you, my noodles?

3053
04:21:06,520 --> 04:21:07,520
They're so tasty.

3054
04:21:07,520 --> 04:21:08,520
Hello, very much, how are you, my noodles?

3055
04:21:08,520 --> 04:21:09,520
They're so tasty.

3056
04:21:22,520 --> 04:21:23,520
I didn't know that.

3057
04:21:27,520 --> 04:21:30,520
Normally I stream for, like, at least three or four hours.

3058
04:21:38,520 --> 04:21:40,520
Two if I'm not super tired.

3059
04:21:45,520 --> 04:21:47,520
Like, streaming in general?

3060
04:21:48,520 --> 04:21:50,520
I've been streaming for five hours now, apparently.

3061
04:21:51,520 --> 04:21:53,520
My bar time starts up on the 17th.

3062
04:21:58,520 --> 04:22:00,520
I'm very vegan, it was my car.

3063
04:22:01,520 --> 04:22:02,520
Not wash was,

04:22:11,520 --> 04:22:13,320

3065

Why are you crying?

3153
04:29:24,940 --> 04:29:26,940
Can you hear me out in the laundry room?

3154
04:29:26,940 --> 04:29:28,940
What's up?

3155
04:29:28,940 --> 04:29:32,940
I think he's bored and he was looking for a toy to play.

3156
04:29:32,940 --> 04:29:34,940
He's like, ah!

3157
04:29:34,940 --> 04:29:38,940
Yeah, you knocked your spring under the couch.

3158
04:29:38,940 --> 04:29:40,940
There's like 20 under there.

3159
04:29:40,940 --> 04:29:42,940
You and your sister.

3160
04:29:42,940 --> 04:29:44,940
Portable stove and a big pot.

3161
04:29:45,940 --> 04:29:48,940
She has a lot of good stuff.

3162
04:29:48,940 --> 04:29:50,940
I don't even know what she puts in her chicken or stew.

3163
04:29:50,940 --> 04:29:52,940
All I know is that it's slaps.

3164
04:29:52,940 --> 04:29:54,940
My mom's really good at stews and soups and baking.

3165
04:29:54,940 --> 04:29:56,940
Really like comfort-y foods.

3166
04:30:04,940 --> 04:30:08,940
I'm sorry, I'm speaking in bun-speak because I'm happy because I have food.

3167
04:30:08,940 --> 04:30:10,940
So my voice is a little bit higher.

3168
04:30:14,940 --> 04:30:16,940
Mm-hmm.

3169
04:30:24,940 --> 04:30:26,940
Is that autism?

3170
04:30:26,940 --> 04:30:28,940
I don't know.

3171
04:30:28,940 --> 04:30:32,940
And those can't compare to squish and ghetto crocs.

3172
04:30:32,940 --> 04:30:36,940
He's making a buzzer with cat crimes.

3173
04:30:38,940 --> 04:30:42,940
You don't have to follow your true voice to find something to pick you.

3174
04:30:45,940 --> 04:30:48,940
Oh my God, I almost tore from the sriracha again.

3175
04:30:52,940 --> 04:30:54,940
Oh my God, I hear my neighbors again.

3176
04:30:54,940 --> 04:30:56,940
The soundproofing in my building is really bad.

3177
04:31:02,940 --> 04:31:04,940
Also when I'm happy, I talk fast.

3178
04:31:06,940 --> 04:31:08,940
Aside from a shabari, unless it's just your persona,

3179
04:31:08,940 --> 04:31:12,940
what other things do you have at your comfortable sharing?

3180
04:31:12,940 --> 04:31:14,940
Do you do a tierless stream of that stuff?

3181
04:31:14,940 --> 04:31:16,940
Every membership?

3182
04:31:18,940 --> 04:31:22,940
I don't really think I can talk about that on a normal YouTube video.

3183
04:31:34,940 --> 04:31:36,940
I think?

3184
04:31:36,940 --> 04:31:38,940
I did a kink tierless before.

3185
04:31:38,940 --> 04:31:40,940
I don't know if it's floating around.

3186
04:31:40,940 --> 04:31:42,940
A lot of it I lied about anyways,

3187
04:31:42,940 --> 04:31:46,940
because I thought I was weird if I liked that stuff.

3188
04:31:46,940 --> 04:31:48,940
So I'm like, oh yeah, this goes on the bottom,

3189
04:31:48,940 --> 04:31:50,940
but now I'm like, I don't like it with shit.

3190
04:31:58,940 --> 04:32:00,940
And just so you guys know,

3191
04:32:00,940 --> 04:32:04,940
just because we were cast as certain characters,

3192
04:32:04,940 --> 04:32:08,940
does that mean we officially have those kinks?

3193
04:32:08,940 --> 04:32:12,940
Like, I'm a dom,

3194
04:32:12,940 --> 04:32:14,940
but I wear shabari ropes.

3195
04:32:14,940 --> 04:32:16,940
But I've actually never been tied up in shabari.

3196
04:32:16,940 --> 04:32:18,940
I feel like I would like it,

3197
04:32:18,940 --> 04:32:20,940
and that's why I wanted to research on it.

3198
04:32:20,940 --> 04:32:22,940
I don't want to do membership streams,

3199
04:32:22,940 --> 04:32:24,940
where I tie myself up in shabari, but yeah.

3200
04:32:32,940 --> 04:32:34,940
I'm kind of just learning.

3201
04:32:35,940 --> 04:32:38,940
And you guys are helping me learn.

3202
04:32:40,940 --> 04:32:42,940
And being corrupted.

3203
04:32:42,940 --> 04:32:44,940
As to your bionicles.

3204
04:32:44,940 --> 04:32:46,940
Lying on the internet, how could I?

3205
04:32:48,940 --> 04:32:50,940
No way that you were involved.

3206
04:32:50,940 --> 04:32:52,940
Yeah, that's true. Some of you guys are major degenerates.

3207
04:32:58,940 --> 04:33:00,940
Like the guy in my Marrow said.

3208
04:33:00,940 --> 04:33:02,940
Never mind, I'm gonna put him on blast.

3209
04:33:02,940 --> 04:33:04,940
He got his own stuff to deal with.

3210
04:33:16,940 --> 04:33:18,940
Yeah, I won't kink shame.

3211
04:33:24,940 --> 04:33:26,940
Some of you do deserve to be shamed.

3212
04:33:28,940 --> 04:33:30,940
I haven't looked at my Marrows today though.

3213
04:33:30,940 --> 04:33:32,940
I think it was all like one or two.

3214
04:33:36,940 --> 04:33:39,940
I'll probably end up answering Marrows tomorrow instead of today.

3215
04:33:42,940 --> 04:33:44,940
Alabama guy.

3216
04:33:46,940 --> 04:33:48,940
You're my cats and macros.

3217
04:33:52,940 --> 04:33:54,940
Because of my reaction, he's like,

3218
04:33:54,940 --> 04:33:56,940
I'm not gonna watch you.

3219
04:34:00,940 --> 04:34:02,940
I was mostly just a meming reaction if anything.

3220
04:34:24,940 --> 04:34:26,940
I might be slightly daffy when I'm Marrows.

3221
04:34:26,940 --> 04:34:28,940
Yeah, Marshmallow. It's almost like Curious Cat.

3222
04:34:28,940 --> 04:34:30,940
Or you could like ask anonymous questions.

3223
04:34:36,940 --> 04:34:38,940
Yeah, IRL, that's so true though.

3224
04:34:38,940 --> 04:34:42,940
Cause I'm like, oh, if it's like anime, hentai based,

3225
04:34:42,940 --> 04:34:44,940
I'm like, yeah, but if it's IRL,

3226
04:34:44,940 --> 04:34:46,940
I'm like, wait a second.

3227
04:34:48,940 --> 04:34:50,940
Just woke up, hello.

3228
04:34:50,940 --> 04:34:52,940
We hanging out.

3229
04:34:52,940 --> 04:34:54,940
Cause like,

3230
04:34:54,940 --> 04:34:56,940
for example,

3231
04:34:56,940 --> 04:34:58,940
I like monsters.

3232
04:35:00,940 --> 04:35:02,940
I'm not gonna fuck a monster in real life.

3233
04:35:04,940 --> 04:35:06,940
Cause one, they don't exist and two, out.

3234
04:35:16,940 --> 04:35:18,940
It's all in Japanese though.

3235
04:35:18,940 --> 04:35:20,940
Link is in the description if you want to try it.

3236
04:35:20,940 --> 04:35:22,940
Yeah, yeah, it says Japanese,

3237
04:35:22,940 --> 04:35:24,940
but you could like, usually depending on,

3238
04:35:24,940 --> 04:35:26,940
like I, to be honest with you guys,

3239
04:35:26,940 --> 04:35:28,940
I just answer all Marrows on my phone.

3240
04:35:28,940 --> 04:35:30,940
Cause my phone,

3241
04:35:30,940 --> 04:35:32,940
I mean, honestly, a lot of web pages just auto translate,

3242
04:35:32,940 --> 04:35:34,940
like, or there'd be Cromer Safari.

3243
04:35:34,940 --> 04:35:36,940
Oh my God, children are running in the hallway.

3244
04:35:38,940 --> 04:35:40,940
It's over for Venom cells.

3245
04:35:40,940 --> 04:35:42,940
Oh my God, Venom in the tongue.

3246
04:35:46,940 --> 04:35:48,940
I haven't even watched the most recent one.

3247
04:35:48,940 --> 04:35:50,940
What are your hobbies?

3248
04:35:50,940 --> 04:35:52,940
It's important to know things when you're dating somebody.

3249
04:35:54,940 --> 04:35:56,940
Well, it seems like you weren't paying attention

3250
04:35:56,940 --> 04:35:58,940
to the first date that we had,

3251
04:35:58,940 --> 04:36:00,940
which was my 2.0.

3252
04:36:00,940 --> 04:36:02,940
So I'm kind of offended that you're not a good listener.

3253
04:36:02,940 --> 04:36:04,940
Cause I talked to you all about all my hobbies in my 2.0.

3254
04:36:08,940 --> 04:36:10,940
And usually when people say like,

3255
04:36:10,940 --> 04:36:12,940
oh, keep this to yourself.

3256
04:36:12,940 --> 04:36:14,940
Cause no matter what, usually

3257
04:36:14,940 --> 04:36:16,940
I can answer Marrows.

3258
04:36:18,940 --> 04:36:20,940
And they are public,

3259
04:36:20,940 --> 04:36:22,940
unless you're logged in

3260
04:36:22,940 --> 04:36:24,940
and then you can send them privately

3261
04:36:24,940 --> 04:36:26,940
and I can respond privately.

3262
04:36:28,940 --> 04:36:30,940
And I can present you like something

3263
04:36:32,940 --> 04:36:34,940
like a pretty picture

3264
04:36:34,940 --> 04:36:36,940
or video.

3265
04:36:38,940 --> 04:36:40,940
But what if you were a rubber bunny?

3266
04:36:40,940 --> 04:36:42,940
Like a rubber ducky?

3267
04:36:42,940 --> 04:36:44,940
Huh?

3268
04:36:46,940 --> 04:36:48,940
What's your favorite monster?

3269
04:36:48,940 --> 04:36:50,940
I don't know why I keep joking.

3270
04:36:52,940 --> 04:36:54,940
Movie from a TV show?

3271
04:36:54,940 --> 04:36:56,940
Oh, alien? The alien from alien?

3272
04:36:58,940 --> 04:37:00,940
Do other people see the Marrow sent to you?

3273
04:37:00,940 --> 04:37:02,940
It's private unless you respond.

3274
04:37:02,940 --> 04:37:04,940
It's private unless they respond.

3275
04:37:04,940 --> 04:37:06,940
And then sometimes you guys will say stuff

3276
04:37:06,940 --> 04:37:08,940
and you're not logged in.

3277
04:37:08,940 --> 04:37:10,940
So if I respond, it will be made public.

3278
04:37:10,940 --> 04:37:12,940
Ow.

3279
04:37:12,940 --> 04:37:14,940
But to remind you,

3280
04:37:14,940 --> 04:37:16,940
it's anonymous no matter what.

3281
04:37:16,940 --> 04:37:18,940
If you have a username, I can't see it.

3282
04:37:18,940 --> 04:37:20,940
But

3283
04:37:22,940 --> 04:37:24,940
if you are not logged in

3284
04:37:24,940 --> 04:37:26,940
and you send me something

3285
04:37:26,940 --> 04:37:28,940
that has a sense of stuff in it,

3286
04:37:28,940 --> 04:37:30,940
I can't...

3287
04:37:30,940 --> 04:37:32,940
I'm not going to respond

3288
04:37:32,940 --> 04:37:34,940
because if I respond, it's going to

3289
04:37:36,940 --> 04:37:38,940
show everybody else what you said.

3290
04:37:38,940 --> 04:37:40,940
So I'm not going to do that to you.

3291
04:37:40,940 --> 04:37:42,940
So sometimes it will be like, oh,

3292
04:37:42,940 --> 04:37:44,940
she didn't respond to my Marrow

3293
04:37:44,940 --> 04:37:46,940
or what I said to her.

3294
04:37:46,940 --> 04:37:48,940
It's because you weren't logged in

3295
04:37:48,940 --> 04:37:50,940
and it was really sensitive

3296
04:37:50,940 --> 04:37:52,940
and I don't know if you want other people

3297
04:37:52,940 --> 04:37:54,940
to see what you sent me.

3298
04:37:56,940 --> 04:37:58,940
My hobbies?

3299
04:37:58,940 --> 04:38:00,940
Do you like to play video games?

3300
04:38:00,940 --> 04:38:02,940
Go for a long run across the beach?

3301
04:38:02,940 --> 04:38:04,940
I like to play instruments.

3302
04:38:04,940 --> 04:38:06,940
Okay.

3303
04:38:06,940 --> 04:38:08,940
Okay.

3304
04:38:08,940 --> 04:38:10,940
Marrow is so hot.

3305
04:38:10,940 --> 04:38:12,940
Is the rock so hot? No, I just...

3306
04:38:12,940 --> 04:38:14,940
I just choked.

3307
04:38:14,940 --> 04:38:16,940
Now I have something stuck in my throat.

3308
04:38:18,940 --> 04:38:20,940
Oh, the A.I.

3309
04:38:20,940 --> 04:38:22,940
Yeah, the A.I. also filters stuff.

3310
04:38:22,940 --> 04:38:24,940
Cat box link

3311
04:38:24,940 --> 04:38:26,940
waxes to the public. I almost did that once.

3312
04:38:26,940 --> 04:38:28,940
I think I sent you an Instagram

3313
04:38:28,940 --> 04:38:30,940
link on Marrow.

3314
04:38:32,940 --> 04:38:34,940
I've said this before in my Marows.

3315
04:38:34,940 --> 04:38:36,940
I feel like I'm from...

3316
04:38:39,940 --> 04:38:41,940
I'm Nick Cage from National Treasure

3317
04:38:41,940 --> 04:38:43,940
trying to put these links together

3318
04:38:43,940 --> 04:38:45,940
so I can understand what you guys are trying to send to me.

3319
04:38:45,940 --> 04:38:47,940
And then you guys send me litter box ones

3320
04:38:47,940 --> 04:38:49,940
and I can't...

3321
04:38:49,940 --> 04:38:51,940
I can't...

3322
04:38:53,940 --> 04:38:55,940
I can't see them the next day

3323
04:38:55,940 --> 04:38:57,940
when I'm not responding immediately

3324
04:38:57,940 --> 04:38:59,940
because it only has like two hours.

3325
04:39:05,940 --> 04:39:07,940
Why are you role playing?

3326
04:39:10,940 --> 04:39:12,940
I'm sorry, this is funny.

3327
04:39:14,940 --> 04:39:16,940
Marrow is a pain for cat box lately.

3328
04:39:16,940 --> 04:39:18,940
Well, cat box has been like

3329
04:39:18,940 --> 04:39:20,940
not working properly

3330
04:39:20,940 --> 04:39:22,940
because I know like Shawnee used to use cat box a lot.

3331
04:39:22,940 --> 04:39:24,940
Yeah, nobody uses cat box anymore

3332
04:39:24,940 --> 04:39:26,940
because it's just like not...

3333
04:39:26,940 --> 04:39:28,940
like sometimes cat box will just break.

3334
04:39:29,940 --> 04:39:31,940
Why do we have therapists here?

3335
04:39:31,940 --> 04:39:33,940
I don't know.

3336
04:39:34,940 --> 04:39:36,940
Do you want me to be your therapist for a moment?

3337
04:39:36,940 --> 04:39:38,940
Let's become more parasocial.

3338
04:39:38,940 --> 04:39:40,940
It's up to you.

3339
04:39:43,940 --> 04:39:45,940
A little bite.

3340
04:39:55,940 --> 04:39:57,940
I haven't seen the...

3341
04:39:58,940 --> 04:40:00,940
Freddie Fazbear guy.

3342
04:40:00,940 --> 04:40:02,940
I'm just a bummer

3343
04:40:02,940 --> 04:40:05,940
because I like reading his comments in my Gregory voice.

3344
04:40:08,940 --> 04:40:10,940
If you're gonna role play

3345
04:40:10,940 --> 04:40:13,940
at least type correctly

3346
04:40:18,940 --> 04:40:20,940
your grammar is atrocious

3347
04:40:20,940 --> 04:40:22,940
and it's disappointing to me

3348
04:40:23,940 --> 04:40:26,940
this date is over if you don't have proper grammar.

3349
04:40:26,940 --> 04:40:28,940
I was kidding, I don't talk in proper grammar.

3350
04:40:28,940 --> 04:40:30,940
At least put in some effort, man.

3351
04:40:32,940 --> 04:40:34,940
I'm just kidding.

3352
04:40:34,940 --> 04:40:36,940
Any case, if I can add a parasocial

3353
04:40:36,940 --> 04:40:38,940
right up on top of everything.

3354
04:40:38,940 --> 04:40:40,940
I don't know, we're just here to hang out.

3355
04:40:40,940 --> 04:40:42,940
You don't have to be parasocial.

3356
04:40:42,940 --> 04:40:44,940
Like for me a parasocial

3357
04:40:44,940 --> 04:40:46,940
because I'm only like talking to you guys.

3358
04:40:46,940 --> 04:40:48,940
Like I could have logged out hours ago

3359
04:40:48,940 --> 04:40:50,940
and stopped streaming

3360
04:40:50,940 --> 04:40:52,940
but I just like hanging out

3361
04:40:52,940 --> 04:40:54,940
because I like people to talk to.

3362
04:41:02,940 --> 04:41:05,940
It fucking got me, Jesus Christ.

3363
04:41:11,940 --> 04:41:13,940
I did not read the full sentence.

3364
04:41:14,940 --> 04:41:16,940
That's funny.

3365
04:41:18,940 --> 04:41:20,940
I actually really like

3366
04:41:20,940 --> 04:41:22,940
I would 100%

3367
04:41:22,940 --> 04:41:24,940
fuck any of the animatronics

3368
04:41:24,940 --> 04:41:26,940
from that

3369
04:41:26,940 --> 04:41:28,940
iteration

3370
04:41:28,940 --> 04:41:30,940
of Five Nights at Freddy's.

3371
04:41:31,940 --> 04:41:33,940
What is it?

3372
04:41:34,940 --> 04:41:36,940
Is it the glam rock?

3373
04:41:37,940 --> 04:41:39,940
Like rock is kind of hot

3374
04:41:39,940 --> 04:41:41,940
and so is Freddy.

3375
04:41:42,940 --> 04:41:44,940
Especially Monty.

3376
04:41:45,940 --> 04:41:48,940
I can't remember the other ones.

3377
04:41:52,940 --> 04:41:54,940
Chica.

3378
04:41:54,940 --> 04:41:56,940
Chica is kind of, you know, she kind of

3379
04:41:56,940 --> 04:41:58,940
she's a little bit, she's a bit loka.

3380
04:41:59,940 --> 04:42:01,940
So the question is

3381
04:42:01,940 --> 04:42:03,940
are you, fuck, I can't read that.

3382
04:42:03,940 --> 04:42:04,940
Are you dominating them?

3383
04:42:04,940 --> 04:42:06,940
Are you the one getting dominated?

3384
04:42:07,940 --> 04:42:09,940
I'm not answering that.

3385
04:42:09,940 --> 04:42:11,940
You don't need to know.

3386
04:42:11,940 --> 04:42:13,940
Gregory, if you want to escape

3387
04:42:13,940 --> 04:42:15,940
you need to donate at least $30

3388
04:42:15,940 --> 04:42:17,940
to SheebieCarve.

3389
04:42:17,940 --> 04:42:21,940
Please, Sheebie, look at my marrows.

3390
04:42:21,940 --> 04:42:23,940
I put my tiny peepee in cat box

3391
04:42:23,940 --> 04:42:25,940
so you can make fun of me, please.

3392
04:42:26,940 --> 04:42:29,940
Chica eats garbage, just like me.

3393
04:42:29,940 --> 04:42:31,940
He's just like me for real, for real.

3394
04:42:34,940 --> 04:42:36,940
Where you probably got pneumatic dong?

3395
04:42:37,940 --> 04:42:39,940
Let me be silly for a second.

3396
04:42:39,940 --> 04:42:41,940
So a lot of my OCs

3397
04:42:41,940 --> 04:42:43,940
were 100% like tulpas.

3398
04:42:45,940 --> 04:42:47,940
When I was growing up and I would draw my OCs

3399
04:42:47,940 --> 04:42:49,940
I would just like talk to them in my head

3400
04:42:49,940 --> 04:42:50,940
because they were real.

3401
04:42:50,940 --> 04:42:52,940
It would be just like a little schizophrenic and everything.

3402
04:42:53,940 --> 04:42:55,940
I can't wait to cut this out of the vlog.

3403
04:43:04,940 --> 04:43:06,940
His name was Zero and he was an android.

3404
04:43:07,940 --> 04:43:10,940
I'm a pent-up religious Christian girl

3405
04:43:10,940 --> 04:43:12,940
with OCs and I draw,

3406
04:43:12,940 --> 04:43:14,940
so I would just draw smut of me and my OCs.

3407
04:43:16,940 --> 04:43:19,940
I need to stop talking in my cute and funny voice.

3408
04:43:19,940 --> 04:43:21,940
I'm sorry.

3409
04:43:22,940 --> 04:43:24,940
My peepee.

3410
04:43:26,940 --> 04:43:30,940
And he had a go-go gadget peepee.

3411
04:43:31,940 --> 04:43:33,940
I wrote an OC name Zero.

3412
04:43:33,940 --> 04:43:35,940
I probably could draw him again and I had another OC.

3413
04:43:37,940 --> 04:43:39,940
His name was,

3414
04:43:39,940 --> 04:43:41,940
he was my sole eater OC.

3415
04:43:42,940 --> 04:43:44,940
So I had,

3416
04:43:45,940 --> 04:43:47,940
it would be really funny if the girl that I used to role-play with

3417
04:43:47,940 --> 04:43:49,940
with our OCs all together

3418
04:43:49,940 --> 04:43:51,940
because she was like my best friend.

3419
04:43:51,940 --> 04:43:53,940
She would totally like VTubers and if she comes across this,

3420
04:43:53,940 --> 04:43:56,940
I will actually probably pass away from this earth

3421
04:43:57,940 --> 04:43:59,940
if she recognizes who I am.

3422
04:44:00,940 --> 04:44:02,940
But I had another character.

3423
04:44:03,940 --> 04:44:05,940
He was my weapon.

3424
04:44:05,940 --> 04:44:07,940
So my OC was Kiri.

3425
04:44:07,940 --> 04:44:09,940
Kiri was,

3426
04:44:10,940 --> 04:44:13,940
she was essentially me but she had pink hair.

3427
04:44:13,940 --> 04:44:16,940
She's very cute, very pastel goff.

3428
04:44:16,940 --> 04:44:20,940
And then James Sinner was her

3429
04:44:20,940 --> 04:44:22,940
weapon.

3430
04:44:22,940 --> 04:44:24,940
And he was a scythe.

3431
04:44:24,940 --> 04:44:26,940
And he was kind of like almost like

3432
04:44:26,940 --> 04:44:28,940
he got a scythe from Akatsuki

3433
04:44:28,940 --> 04:44:30,940
from Naruto.

3434
04:44:30,940 --> 04:44:32,940
And he had like three

3435
04:44:34,940 --> 04:44:36,940
three blades.

3436
04:44:36,940 --> 04:44:38,940
And he also had like three beauty marks on his face.

3437
04:44:40,940 --> 04:44:42,940
And he had bright red hair.

3438
04:44:44,940 --> 04:44:46,940
And his family

3439
04:44:46,940 --> 04:44:48,940
were all

3440
04:44:48,940 --> 04:44:50,940
representations

3441
04:44:50,940 --> 04:44:52,940
of the seven license.

3442
04:44:54,940 --> 04:44:56,940
He was pretty, he was pretty sick.

3443
04:44:58,940 --> 04:45:00,940
Which out of the viewer girlies

3444
04:45:00,940 --> 04:45:02,940
would pull up pastel goff?

3445
04:45:02,940 --> 04:45:04,940
Look, I would say Icy.

3446
04:45:10,940 --> 04:45:12,940
Just checking, you mentioned people

3447
04:45:12,940 --> 04:45:14,940
setting a sense of contramarrow.

3448
04:45:14,940 --> 04:45:16,940
I appreciate it.

3449
04:45:16,940 --> 04:45:18,940
Every time I like tributes, I accept those.

3450
04:45:18,940 --> 04:45:20,940
I don't mind.

3451
04:45:22,940 --> 04:45:24,940
I may, I don't respond right away.

3452
04:45:26,940 --> 04:45:28,940
I like kitty on Twitter, she's adorable.

3453
04:45:28,940 --> 04:45:30,940
Yeah.

3454
04:45:30,940 --> 04:45:32,940
I don't mind them, I like videos.

3455
04:45:36,940 --> 04:45:38,940
Am I supposed, am I not supposed to be saying the quieter part out loud?

3456
04:45:44,940 --> 04:45:46,940
Are my kitty's there? Okay.

3457
04:45:46,940 --> 04:45:48,940
Oh, chilling.

3458
04:45:48,940 --> 04:45:50,940
Oh, Mercy, she's not fit for the goff thing.

3459
04:45:50,940 --> 04:45:52,940
Yeah, pastel goff is different though.

3460
04:45:52,940 --> 04:45:54,940
She would be, if anyone's so like,

3461
04:45:54,940 --> 04:45:56,940
I can like bright, so like

3462
04:45:58,940 --> 04:46:00,940
excuse me, Emmy would be just emo goff,

3463
04:46:00,940 --> 04:46:02,940
like a typical goff.

3464
04:46:06,940 --> 04:46:08,940
Mercy would be a seeing goff.

3465
04:46:08,940 --> 04:46:10,940
Icy would be pastel goff.

3466
04:46:10,940 --> 04:46:12,940
Icy

3467
04:46:14,940 --> 04:46:16,940
would be

3468
04:46:16,940 --> 04:46:18,940
just normal goff,

3469
04:46:18,940 --> 04:46:20,940
like Dami mommy alternative

3470
04:46:20,940 --> 04:46:22,940
black girl goff.

3471
04:46:24,940 --> 04:46:26,940
And then I would

3472
04:46:26,940 --> 04:46:28,940
I don't know what type of goff I would be

3473
04:46:28,940 --> 04:46:30,940
to be honest with you.

3474
04:46:32,940 --> 04:46:34,940
I didn't think about that.

3475
04:46:36,940 --> 04:46:38,940
What does not

3476
04:46:38,940 --> 04:46:40,940
being per socialist or king

3477
04:46:40,940 --> 04:46:42,940
around in the gathering of different

3478
04:46:42,940 --> 04:46:44,940
what the fuck are you saying, dude?

3479
04:46:48,940 --> 04:46:50,940
Are you wearing a fedora right now?

3480
04:46:54,940 --> 04:46:56,940
Base goff. Yeah.

3481
04:46:56,940 --> 04:46:58,940
I'll be one of those like industrial goffs.

3482
04:47:00,940 --> 04:47:02,940
Like, you know those like goffs that like the dancing goffs

3483
04:47:02,940 --> 04:47:04,940
and that one meme and them.

3484
04:47:04,940 --> 04:47:06,940
I'll be shuffling.

3485
04:47:09,940 --> 04:47:11,940
Superstar DJ.

3486
04:47:13,940 --> 04:47:15,940
It was funny when we were

3487
04:47:15,940 --> 04:47:17,940
me and Icy and manager

3488
04:47:17,940 --> 04:47:19,940
and the other girls were talking about like her DJ set.

3489
04:47:19,940 --> 04:47:21,940
We were talking about like

3490
04:47:23,940 --> 04:47:25,940
shuffling and stuff and we

3491
04:47:25,940 --> 04:47:27,940
and then managers post that song

3492
04:47:27,940 --> 04:47:29,940
with the OG like

3493
04:47:29,940 --> 04:47:31,940
Sydney shuffle, I think what it's called

3494
04:47:31,940 --> 04:47:33,940
video and I'm like, oh my fucking god, then be

3495
04:47:33,940 --> 04:47:35,940
and Icy were just fucking jamming.

3496
04:47:35,940 --> 04:47:37,940
We're just like don't don't don't don't don't

3497
04:47:37,940 --> 04:47:39,940
don't don't

3498
04:47:39,940 --> 04:47:41,940
don't don't don't don't

3499
04:47:41,940 --> 04:47:43,940
don't don't don't

3500
04:47:43,940 --> 04:47:45,940
I can't shuffle. I used to be able to shuffle.

3501
04:47:46,940 --> 04:47:48,940
Vampires in the club scene.

3502
04:47:48,940 --> 04:47:50,940
Oh, no, actually, I would be

3503
04:47:50,940 --> 04:47:52,940
the true blood goff.

3504
04:47:52,940 --> 04:47:54,940
Like I would be like fantasia.

3505
04:47:55,940 --> 04:47:57,940
One Eric Northman

3506
04:47:57,940 --> 04:47:59,940
is.

3507
04:47:59,940 --> 04:48:01,940
I love him

3508
04:48:01,940 --> 04:48:03,940
and

3509
04:48:03,940 --> 04:48:05,940
his

3510
04:48:05,940 --> 04:48:07,940
prod her knee. She was pretty hot too. I can't remember her name.

3511
04:48:09,940 --> 04:48:11,940
The second I'm dancing vampire game.

3512
04:48:11,940 --> 04:48:13,940
Yeah, that's my seed.

3513
04:48:13,940 --> 04:48:15,940
Wow. Can you put it that way?

3514
04:48:15,940 --> 04:48:17,940
Either way is fine. How long will he have?

3515
04:48:20,940 --> 04:48:22,940
Can someone help him?

3516
04:48:23,940 --> 04:48:25,940
It can someone.

3517
04:48:27,940 --> 04:48:29,940
What bro?

3518
04:48:29,940 --> 04:48:31,940
Bro, it's tweaking.

3519
04:48:31,940 --> 04:48:33,940
Are you?

3520
04:48:33,940 --> 04:48:35,940
Are you?

3521
04:48:35,940 --> 04:48:37,940
I know English is probably just not their first language.

3522
04:48:41,940 --> 04:48:43,940
I am wonder.

3523
04:48:43,940 --> 04:48:45,940
I wonder what would happen if a werewolf

3524
04:48:45,940 --> 04:48:47,940
and a vampire hook up? How would that work?

3525
04:48:47,940 --> 04:48:49,940
I'm very curious for your answer.

3526
04:48:49,940 --> 04:48:51,940
They would probably just hook up normally.

3527
04:48:51,940 --> 04:48:53,940
I don't know.

3528
04:48:57,940 --> 04:48:59,940
I think they would just hook up normally.

3529
04:49:01,940 --> 04:49:03,940
I don't think the wolf is going into wolf form

3530
04:49:03,940 --> 04:49:05,940
although

3531
04:49:05,940 --> 04:49:07,940
maybe I don't fucking know.

3532
04:49:07,940 --> 04:49:09,940
That's forbidden but that's true.

3533
04:49:09,940 --> 04:49:11,940
You know, it's a little Romeo and Julie at moment.

3534
04:49:13,940 --> 04:49:15,940
There's too much DMT.

3535
04:49:19,940 --> 04:49:21,940
Wolf vampire hybrids?

3536
04:49:21,940 --> 04:49:23,940
I am wonder.

3537
04:49:23,940 --> 04:49:25,940
Not now again.

3538
04:49:25,940 --> 04:49:27,940
Mr. Wolf

3539
04:49:27,940 --> 04:49:29,940
I think it's time to sleep.

3540
04:49:31,940 --> 04:49:33,940
Hold on.

3541
04:49:33,940 --> 04:49:35,940
What's that?

3542
04:49:35,940 --> 04:49:37,940
So SZA

3543
04:49:37,940 --> 04:49:39,940
What is the party over?

3544
04:49:39,940 --> 04:49:41,940
Get your ass to bed. You got school tomorrow.

3545
04:49:41,940 --> 04:49:43,940
Let's take a talk. Hi Rena.

3546
04:49:43,940 --> 04:49:45,940
You gonna come up here?

3547
04:49:47,940 --> 04:49:49,940
Miss Rena

3548
04:49:51,940 --> 04:49:53,940
Hey, could you not?

3549
04:49:53,940 --> 04:49:55,940
You guys are bad.

3550
04:49:57,940 --> 04:49:59,940
Well, when a werewolf and a vampire

3551
04:49:59,940 --> 04:50:01,940
love each other very much, they give each other a special hug.

3552
04:50:03,940 --> 04:50:05,940
Honestly, if I ever had a child

3553
04:50:05,940 --> 04:50:07,940
I would probably explain it like that.

3554
04:50:09,940 --> 04:50:11,940
I don't know why my model is lying.

3555
04:50:11,940 --> 04:50:13,940
Usually around this time my internet just like fucking dies.

3556
04:50:15,940 --> 04:50:17,940
Will I sleep? I think I'll sleep.

3557
04:50:17,940 --> 04:50:19,940
I didn't sleep.

3558
04:50:19,940 --> 04:50:21,940
I didn't sleep.

3559
04:50:21,940 --> 04:50:23,940
Yesterday

3560
04:50:23,940 --> 04:50:25,940
So

3561
04:50:25,940 --> 04:50:27,940
I am not.

3562
04:50:27,940 --> 04:50:29,940
Oh my god, not.

3563
04:50:29,940 --> 04:50:31,940
I mean, the real question is

3564
04:50:31,940 --> 04:50:33,940
Where will fuck the vampire human formable form?

3565
04:50:33,940 --> 04:50:35,940
I think it's funny because I got one of those toys

3566
04:50:35,940 --> 04:50:37,940
and people were like

3567
04:50:37,940 --> 04:50:39,940
So should we must really like dogs?

3568
04:50:39,940 --> 04:50:41,940
No, what the fuck is wrong with you?

3569
04:50:45,940 --> 04:50:47,940
My marrow is like hey

3570
04:50:47,940 --> 04:50:49,940
You like dogs?

3571
04:50:49,940 --> 04:50:51,940
And I'm like

3572
04:50:51,940 --> 04:50:53,940
I'm not Whitney Wisconsin dude

3573
04:50:53,940 --> 04:50:55,940
I made the joke before, I'll say it again.

3574
04:50:57,940 --> 04:50:59,940
Call her a leisure for you guys exactly.

3575
04:51:01,940 --> 04:51:03,940
Bark

3576
04:51:03,940 --> 04:51:05,940
Bark for me

3577
04:51:11,940 --> 04:51:13,940
Sorry, you just know many times.

3578
04:51:15,940 --> 04:51:17,940
Good puppies, good puppies.

3579
04:51:19,940 --> 04:51:21,940
Do you need to go outside and do pee pee?

3580
04:51:21,940 --> 04:51:23,940
Do you need to do pee pee puppy?

3581
04:51:23,940 --> 04:51:25,940
A lot of you guys asked me to talk to you like I talk to my cats.

3582
04:51:29,940 --> 04:51:31,940
Rina, Rina, what are you doing?

3583
04:51:31,940 --> 04:51:33,940
Are you purring?

3584
04:51:33,940 --> 04:51:35,940
Are you gonna purr for stream?

3585
04:51:35,940 --> 04:51:37,940
Reapers?

3586
04:51:49,940 --> 04:51:51,940
Rina

3587
04:51:55,940 --> 04:51:57,940
Oh to be a cat

3588
04:52:01,940 --> 04:52:03,940
She's a smugly.

3589
04:52:03,940 --> 04:52:05,940
Based on the cult stream we

3590
04:52:05,940 --> 04:52:07,940
Hi guys, we're just not finishing your sentences.

3591
04:52:07,940 --> 04:52:09,940
Yeah, I saw that.

3592
04:52:09,940 --> 04:52:11,940
I saw that. I saw that.

3593
04:52:11,940 --> 04:52:13,940
Adorable.

3594
04:52:13,940 --> 04:52:15,940
Rina is my soul kitty.

3595
04:52:15,940 --> 04:52:17,940
She's my best friend.

3596
04:52:17,940 --> 04:52:19,940
My mom

3597
04:52:19,940 --> 04:52:21,940
And

3598
04:52:21,940 --> 04:52:23,940
Me went to go pick up her and her sister.

3599
04:52:23,940 --> 04:52:25,940
Her sister has passed away a couple years ago.

3600
04:52:25,940 --> 04:52:27,940
She was 11.

3601
04:52:29,940 --> 04:52:31,940
We went to the cat breeder.

3602
04:52:33,940 --> 04:52:35,940
Sorry, I got you my nose.

3603
04:52:35,940 --> 04:52:37,940
And they're like

3604
04:52:37,940 --> 04:52:39,940
Oh yeah, these are the kittens that were reserved for you.

3605
04:52:39,940 --> 04:52:41,940
We went to a cat breeder because we had to

3606
04:52:41,940 --> 04:52:43,940
My mom has allergies so she wanted to make sure they were fine.

3607
04:52:43,940 --> 04:52:45,940
Although

3608
04:52:45,940 --> 04:52:47,940
Fia and Bumi don't even give me allergies.

3609
04:52:47,940 --> 04:52:49,940
Rina does.

3610
04:52:49,940 --> 04:52:51,940
So what was up with that?

3611
04:52:53,940 --> 04:52:55,940
Yeah, it's always an awesome cat.

3612
04:52:55,940 --> 04:52:57,940
She was a great cat. She was like a dog.

3613
04:52:57,940 --> 04:52:59,940
It was funny. She was my fetch.

3614
04:52:59,940 --> 04:53:01,940
She would like work at you.

3615
04:53:05,940 --> 04:53:07,940
But I held Rina

3616
04:53:07,940 --> 04:53:09,940
And I knew she was

3617
04:53:09,940 --> 04:53:11,940
Gonna be my best friend.

3618
04:53:11,940 --> 04:53:13,940
And

3619
04:53:13,940 --> 04:53:15,940
And I just held her like a little baby

3620
04:53:15,940 --> 04:53:17,940
And she was in my arm. She just looked at me

3621
04:53:17,940 --> 04:53:19,940
And she just purred.

3622
04:53:19,940 --> 04:53:21,940
And I'm like, yep.

3623
04:53:21,940 --> 04:53:23,940
And she has been

3624
04:53:23,940 --> 04:53:25,940
Back to me like glue ever since.

3625
04:53:25,940 --> 04:53:27,940
I'm gonna be very sad when she passes.

3626
04:53:27,940 --> 04:53:29,940
Cause she's getting up in age.

3627
04:53:29,940 --> 04:53:31,940
And she has, like, I saw the kittens and stuff.

3628
04:53:31,940 --> 04:53:33,940
So I just wanted to be happy

3629
04:53:33,940 --> 04:53:35,940
And healthy.

3630
04:53:35,940 --> 04:53:37,940
Yeah

3631
04:53:37,940 --> 04:53:39,940
She was 11

3632
04:53:39,940 --> 04:53:41,940
She was a seal point Siamese

3633
04:53:41,940 --> 04:53:43,940
So she was the typical

3634
04:53:43,940 --> 04:53:45,940
Siamese that you see.

3635
04:53:45,940 --> 04:53:47,940
They're Applehead Siamese

3636
04:53:47,940 --> 04:53:49,940
They're not Oriental Siamese

3637
04:53:49,940 --> 04:53:51,940
Which are those

3638
04:53:51,940 --> 04:53:53,940
The ones from Lady and the Tramp

3639
04:53:53,940 --> 04:53:55,940
Which are like the really

3640
04:53:55,940 --> 04:53:57,940
Skinny looking ones.

3641
04:53:59,940 --> 04:54:01,940
Oriental cats are so cute though.

3642
04:54:01,940 --> 04:54:03,940
They're kind of like goofy looking with their muzzles.

3643
04:54:06,940 --> 04:54:08,940
Almost have a future status.

3644
04:54:08,940 --> 04:54:11,940
But then I like think and I think all the

3645
04:54:11,940 --> 04:54:13,940
Sorry, my voice is broke for a second.

3646
04:54:13,940 --> 04:54:15,940
All the

3647
04:54:15,940 --> 04:54:17,940
Memories are just so worth it.

3648
04:54:17,940 --> 04:54:19,940
And you give them like a good little life.

3649
04:54:19,940 --> 04:54:21,940
Cause I rescued Fia and Bumi.

3650
04:54:21,940 --> 04:54:23,940
They initially came from Mississippi

3651
04:54:23,940 --> 04:54:25,940
In the south

3652
04:54:25,940 --> 04:54:27,940
They're not actually related.

3653
04:54:27,940 --> 04:54:29,940
They're a month apart.

3654
04:54:29,940 --> 04:54:31,940
They're not from the same litter.

3655
04:54:31,940 --> 04:54:33,940
I just refer to them as the twins, brother and sister. Cause they act like it.

3656
04:54:33,940 --> 04:54:35,940
And yeah

3657
04:54:35,940 --> 04:54:37,940
Fia's sister died

3658
04:54:37,940 --> 04:54:39,940
When they were kittens

3659
04:54:39,940 --> 04:54:41,940
And that's why I was very determined

3660
04:54:41,940 --> 04:54:43,940
To make sure Fia was okay.

3661
04:54:43,940 --> 04:54:45,940
And then Bumi

3662
04:54:47,940 --> 04:54:49,940
Came from a litter of like six kittens

3663
04:54:49,940 --> 04:54:51,940
And they were just like found on the street.

3664
04:54:53,940 --> 04:54:55,940
Yeah, it's really

3665
04:54:55,940 --> 04:54:57,940
It is really devastating losing a pet. Cause they're like

3666
04:54:57,940 --> 04:54:59,940
People are like oh, but if you never had a pet

3667
04:54:59,940 --> 04:55:01,940
You don't get it, but like they really are part of the family.

3668
04:55:03,940 --> 04:55:05,940
I like cats because

3669
04:55:05,940 --> 04:55:07,940
A lot of their stuff is instinctual

3670
04:55:07,940 --> 04:55:09,940
And I don't have to train them to do anything

3671
04:55:09,940 --> 04:55:11,940
Although it is very impressive that I managed to

3672
04:55:11,940 --> 04:55:13,940
Create train Fia and Bumi

3673
04:55:15,940 --> 04:55:17,940
I don't know how that works, but

3674
04:55:17,940 --> 04:55:19,940
You can create train a cat

3675
04:55:23,940 --> 04:55:25,940
Cats are pretty independent

3676
04:55:25,940 --> 04:55:27,940
They clean themselves

3677
04:55:27,940 --> 04:55:29,940
They groom themselves

3678
04:55:29,940 --> 04:55:31,940
Use the bathroom

3679
04:55:31,940 --> 04:55:33,940
And what you really gotta do is feed them

3680
04:55:33,940 --> 04:55:35,940
And give them toys

3681
04:55:35,940 --> 04:55:37,940
In a nice comfy bed

3682
04:55:39,940 --> 04:55:41,940
Yeah, and they can be pretty independent

3683
04:55:43,940 --> 04:55:45,940
Family have had seven cats

3684
04:55:45,940 --> 04:55:47,940
To all the creature

3685
04:55:47,940 --> 04:55:49,940
My friend has 20 cats

3686
04:55:49,940 --> 04:55:51,940
He thought I was a cat lady

3687
04:55:51,940 --> 04:55:53,940
She has 20 cats

3688
04:55:55,940 --> 04:55:57,940
And she just got like

3689
04:55:57,940 --> 04:55:59,940
Four more

3690
04:55:59,940 --> 04:56:01,940
So like 20 are at her parents house

3691
04:56:01,940 --> 04:56:03,940
And then she moved out and she got four cats of her own

3692
04:56:05,940 --> 04:56:07,940
I'm like girl, you need to stop

3693
04:56:09,940 --> 04:56:11,940
Yeah

3694
04:56:11,940 --> 04:56:13,940
And they have like

3695
04:56:13,940 --> 04:56:15,940
Her and her boyfriend

3696
04:56:15,940 --> 04:56:17,940
They're building like a

3697
04:56:17,940 --> 04:56:19,940
Like a cat patio

3698
04:56:19,940 --> 04:56:21,940
Or a cat room for all the cats

3699
04:56:21,940 --> 04:56:23,940
And I'm like, honestly, he's a real one for that

3700
04:56:23,940 --> 04:56:25,940
I don't think anybody I meet

3701
04:56:25,940 --> 04:56:27,940
Would help me make one of those

3702
04:56:29,940 --> 04:56:31,940
I

3703
04:56:31,940 --> 04:56:33,940
I mean

3704
04:56:33,940 --> 04:56:35,940
He just looks at me up with me

3705
04:56:35,940 --> 04:56:37,940
With her big blue eyes

3706
04:56:37,940 --> 04:56:39,940
How do they take care of all of them?

3707
04:56:39,940 --> 04:56:41,940
I think, uh

3708
04:56:41,940 --> 04:56:43,940
I don't know, to be honest

3709
04:56:43,940 --> 04:56:45,940
It's really just like, again, staying on top of the litter boxes

3710
04:56:45,940 --> 04:56:47,940
And then feeding them

3711
04:56:47,940 --> 04:56:49,940
So I'm making sure they have like clean water

3712
04:56:49,940 --> 04:56:51,940
And toys

3713
04:56:51,940 --> 04:56:53,940
And like brushing

3714
04:56:53,940 --> 04:56:55,940
The ones that need to be brushed

3715
04:56:55,940 --> 04:56:57,940
I brush Rena a lot more often now

3716
04:56:57,940 --> 04:56:59,940
Although she's a short-haired cat

3717
04:56:59,940 --> 04:57:01,940
She's been shedding a lot more

3718
04:57:01,940 --> 04:57:03,940
Because it's around the summer

3719
04:57:03,940 --> 04:57:05,940
And she tends to get hairballs

3720
04:57:05,940 --> 04:57:07,940
And Rena also likes to fucking eat my hair when I sleep

3721
04:57:09,940 --> 04:57:11,940
Two, four snakes and two leopard geckers

3722
04:57:11,940 --> 04:57:13,940
That's really cool

3723
04:57:13,940 --> 04:57:15,940
I always wanted a snake

3724
04:57:15,940 --> 04:57:17,940
My parents said no

3725
04:57:19,940 --> 04:57:21,940
I wanted a ball python

3726
04:57:21,940 --> 04:57:23,940
And I also wanted tarantulas

3727
04:57:23,940 --> 04:57:25,940
And my mom was like, nope

3728
04:57:25,940 --> 04:57:27,940
What about isopods?

3729
04:57:27,940 --> 04:57:29,940
And my mom was like, what the fuck is an isopod?

3730
04:57:29,940 --> 04:57:31,940
I'm like, it's a really pulley

3731
04:57:31,940 --> 04:57:33,940
She's like, you can keep it outside

3732
04:57:33,940 --> 04:57:35,940
And I'm like, that doesn't make any sense

3733
04:57:35,940 --> 04:57:37,940
She's like, exactly, why would you want one?

3734
04:57:39,940 --> 04:57:41,940
Two ball pythons on morphs

3735
04:57:43,940 --> 04:57:45,940
My friend had a

3736
04:57:45,940 --> 04:57:47,940
Wild type

3737
04:57:47,940 --> 04:57:49,940
Ball python in a

3738
04:57:49,940 --> 04:57:51,940
Albino corn snake

3739
04:57:51,940 --> 04:57:53,940
They're pretty cool

3740
04:57:53,940 --> 04:57:55,940
She had to give them away to her

3741
04:57:55,940 --> 04:57:57,940
Friend though, when she moved though

3742
04:57:57,940 --> 04:57:59,940
Well, actually not her friend

3743
04:57:59,940 --> 04:58:01,940
To her, her cousin

3744
04:58:01,940 --> 04:58:03,940
Really pulley, they're called isopods

3745
04:58:03,940 --> 04:58:05,940
Yeah, they're invertebrates

3746
04:58:05,940 --> 04:58:07,940
There's actually a lot of different types of them

3747
04:58:07,940 --> 04:58:09,940
My favorite is the ducky isopod

3748
04:58:09,940 --> 04:58:11,940
They look like little ducks

3749
04:58:13,940 --> 04:58:15,940
Do you do out yellow pythons?

3750
04:58:15,940 --> 04:58:17,940
Like a Burmese python?

3751
04:58:17,940 --> 04:58:19,940
They're kind of

3752
04:58:19,940 --> 04:58:21,940
I think Burmese pythons

3753
04:58:21,940 --> 04:58:23,940
Are very gorgeous

3754
04:58:23,940 --> 04:58:25,940
But they're very invasive

3755
04:58:25,940 --> 04:58:27,940
Especially in Florida

3756
04:58:27,940 --> 04:58:29,940
People just release them

3757
04:58:29,940 --> 04:58:31,940
So they've really kind of ruined their ecosystem down there

3758
04:58:35,940 --> 04:58:37,940
All the snakes and cats don't get along

3759
04:58:37,940 --> 04:58:39,940
Yeah, my friend also

3760
04:58:39,940 --> 04:58:41,940
Had gotten cats too

3761
04:58:41,940 --> 04:58:43,940
So that's another reason

3762
04:58:43,940 --> 04:58:45,940
Actually, they would kind of just sit and watch the snake

3763
04:58:45,940 --> 04:58:47,940
But then at some point

3764
04:58:47,940 --> 04:58:49,940
They just knew it was better

3765
04:58:49,940 --> 04:58:51,940
You don't want to stress out the snake

3766
04:58:51,940 --> 04:58:53,940
You be such a big girl

3767
04:58:53,940 --> 04:58:55,940
Thank you

3768
04:58:55,940 --> 04:58:57,940
I'm a bug girl, yeah

3769
04:58:57,940 --> 04:58:59,940
Hog noses are so cute

3770
04:58:59,940 --> 04:59:01,940
I remember me and my dad

3771
04:59:01,940 --> 04:59:03,940
Begging my mom to get a hog nose

3772
04:59:05,940 --> 04:59:07,940
I can't remember what my dad wanted to name it

3773
04:59:07,940 --> 04:59:09,940
Like Miss Piggy or something

3774
04:59:09,940 --> 04:59:11,940
One's a pie ball, then that's a pastel champagne lesser

3775
04:59:11,940 --> 04:59:13,940
Ooh, pretty

3776
04:59:13,940 --> 04:59:15,940
I remember I wanted a pie ball so bad

3777
04:59:15,940 --> 04:59:17,940
And keeping

3778
04:59:17,940 --> 04:59:19,940
And keeping is cool

3779
04:59:19,940 --> 04:59:21,940
Occasionally that like one

3780
04:59:21,940 --> 04:59:23,940
What's that guy's name

3781
04:59:23,940 --> 04:59:25,940
He like does a lot of

3782
04:59:25,940 --> 04:59:27,940
He has this whole like bioactive enclosure

3783
04:59:27,940 --> 04:59:29,940
And he releases like a lot of ants and bugs in it

3784
04:59:29,940 --> 04:59:31,940
And it's so cool

3785
04:59:31,940 --> 04:59:33,940
Like ants are very interesting

3786
04:59:33,940 --> 04:59:35,940
I used to like ants

3787
04:59:35,940 --> 04:59:37,940
It was weird

3788
04:59:37,940 --> 04:59:39,940
My mom said that

3789
04:59:39,940 --> 04:59:41,940
We had in our

3790
04:59:41,940 --> 04:59:43,940
Like our little like don't be apartment

3791
04:59:43,940 --> 04:59:45,940
But um

3792
04:59:45,940 --> 04:59:47,940
We lived in

3793
04:59:47,940 --> 04:59:49,940
We had like an ant problem

3794
04:59:49,940 --> 04:59:51,940
And so my mom like hired an exterminator

3795
04:59:51,940 --> 04:59:53,940
And like was getting a lot of traps and stuff

3796
04:59:53,940 --> 04:59:55,940
And I was

3797
04:59:55,940 --> 04:59:57,940
My mom said that I was um

3798
04:59:57,940 --> 04:59:59,940
Trying to take the ants outside

3799
04:59:59,940 --> 05:00:01,940
And I was saying

3800
05:00:01,940 --> 05:00:03,940
Little ant turn away

3801
05:00:03,940 --> 05:00:05,940
Go back to your family

3802
05:00:05,940 --> 05:00:07,940
My mom is gonna kill you

3803
05:00:07,940 --> 05:00:09,940
You gotta go

3804
05:00:09,940 --> 05:00:11,940
And I was like trying to save the ants

3805
05:00:11,940 --> 05:00:13,940
I watched one of my um

3806
05:00:13,940 --> 05:00:15,940
Favorite channels

3807
05:00:15,940 --> 05:00:17,940
They don't really upload as much anymore

3808
05:00:17,940 --> 05:00:19,940
Was um

3809
05:00:19,940 --> 05:00:21,940
Uh

3810
05:00:21,940 --> 05:00:23,940
Something flower horn

3811
05:00:23,940 --> 05:00:25,940
Something the flower horn

3812
05:00:25,940 --> 05:00:27,940
That was a cool and it was like

3813
05:00:27,940 --> 05:00:29,940
They always played like classical music

3814
05:00:29,940 --> 05:00:31,940
And I would just like watch and they like

3815
05:00:31,940 --> 05:00:33,940
Had a lot of beta fish

3816
05:00:33,940 --> 05:00:35,940
But then like I was like

3817
05:00:35,940 --> 05:00:37,940
No my mom

3818
05:00:37,940 --> 05:00:39,940
Then my dad told me that

3819
05:00:39,940 --> 05:00:41,940
I would take magnifying glasses

3820
05:00:41,940 --> 05:00:43,940
And set ants on fire

3821
05:00:43,940 --> 05:00:45,940
So I like was nice and then I would try to kill ants

3822
05:00:45,940 --> 05:00:47,940
And you know like

3823
05:00:47,940 --> 05:00:49,940
Out some part of the year

3824
05:00:49,940 --> 05:00:51,940
Like a lot of ants will rise

3825
05:00:51,940 --> 05:00:53,940
Come out of the ground

3826
05:00:53,940 --> 05:00:55,940
Sometimes when after like it rains or something

3827
05:00:55,940 --> 05:00:57,940
And there's like a just a giant

3828
05:00:57,940 --> 05:00:59,940
Riving mass of them

3829
05:00:59,940 --> 05:01:01,940
Food the flower horn

3830
05:01:01,940 --> 05:01:03,940
Yes food the flower horn so good

3831
05:01:03,940 --> 05:01:05,940
I love that channel

3832
05:01:05,940 --> 05:01:07,940
I was allowing them to have full sense of security

3833
05:01:07,940 --> 05:01:09,940
So because

3834
05:01:09,940 --> 05:01:11,940
We didn't want ant problems

3835
05:01:11,940 --> 05:01:13,940
Me and my dad are gonna sound like fucking psychopaths

3836
05:01:13,940 --> 05:01:15,940
We would just dump

3837
05:01:15,940 --> 05:01:17,940
Rubbing alcohol

3838
05:01:17,940 --> 05:01:19,940
On the

3839
05:01:19,940 --> 05:01:21,940
Giant ant mess

3840
05:01:21,940 --> 05:01:23,940
And then we would set them on fire

3841
05:01:23,940 --> 05:01:25,940
And it smelled like bacon

3842
05:01:27,940 --> 05:01:29,940
Kind of fucked

3843
05:01:31,940 --> 05:01:33,940
But

3844
05:01:33,940 --> 05:01:35,940
I don't do that

3845
05:01:35,940 --> 05:01:37,940
It's really just to fight the ant problem

3846
05:01:39,940 --> 05:01:41,940
I need citizen gasoline

3847
05:01:41,940 --> 05:01:43,940
So yeah I've seen that

3848
05:01:43,940 --> 05:01:45,940
We have

3849
05:01:45,940 --> 05:01:47,940
Because my mom has like a really

3850
05:01:47,940 --> 05:01:49,940
She has a garden because that's her thing

3851
05:01:49,940 --> 05:01:51,940
She loves gardening

3852
05:01:51,940 --> 05:01:53,940
That's why she says she wants to hijack my channel

3853
05:01:53,940 --> 05:01:55,940
So she can garden

3854
05:01:55,940 --> 05:01:57,940
She's like there's a gardening niche

3855
05:01:57,940 --> 05:01:59,940
In redacted

3856
05:01:59,940 --> 05:02:01,940
Area that needs to be filled

3857
05:02:01,940 --> 05:02:03,940
It's my time like mom no

3858
05:02:05,940 --> 05:02:07,940
She being a cheep

3859
05:02:07,940 --> 05:02:09,940
And

3860
05:02:09,940 --> 05:02:11,940
So they had to I think they had to get rid of

3861
05:02:11,940 --> 05:02:13,940
Boss that way

3862
05:02:13,940 --> 05:02:15,940
Because they also we have like a

3863
05:02:15,940 --> 05:02:17,940
Really old shed that like the bees just like to hang out in this

3864
05:02:17,940 --> 05:02:19,940
There's some

3865
05:02:19,940 --> 05:02:21,940
Yellow jackets that I

3866
05:02:21,940 --> 05:02:23,940
Are under my balcony

3867
05:02:23,940 --> 05:02:25,940
And I still haven't

3868
05:02:25,940 --> 05:02:27,940
Figured out how my lower neighbors hasn't

3869
05:02:27,940 --> 05:02:29,940
Seen their nest yet because every summer

3870
05:02:29,940 --> 05:02:31,940
Like I used to let

3871
05:02:31,940 --> 05:02:33,940
Rain out on my balcony

3872
05:02:33,940 --> 05:02:35,940
Had not the other cats because I know

3873
05:02:35,940 --> 05:02:37,940
They will just fucking kamikaze themselves off

3874
05:02:37,940 --> 05:02:39,940
I also had like a border around

3875
05:02:39,940 --> 05:02:41,940
So that they couldn't like put their head through the bars

3876
05:02:41,940 --> 05:02:43,940
Just in case they did get out if I opened it

3877
05:02:43,940 --> 05:02:45,940
And um

3878
05:02:47,940 --> 05:02:49,940
Fucking excuse you neighbor

3879
05:02:49,940 --> 05:02:51,940
Coughing super fucking wildly as they walk by

3880
05:02:53,940 --> 05:02:55,940
And um I remember

3881
05:02:55,940 --> 05:02:57,940
There was like a bunch of wasps that like

3882
05:02:57,940 --> 05:02:59,940
Early yellow jackets or whatever

3883
05:02:59,940 --> 05:03:01,940
That were like right near where I would sit

3884
05:03:03,940 --> 05:03:05,940
I just crashed fucking coughing up a lung dude

3885
05:03:05,940 --> 05:03:07,940
And um

3886
05:03:07,940 --> 05:03:09,940
I like ran

3887
05:03:09,940 --> 05:03:11,940
To bring Raina inside

3888
05:03:11,940 --> 05:03:13,940
Because I didn't want her getting stung

3889
05:03:13,940 --> 05:03:15,940
Although cats look kind of funny when they are stung by a bee

3890
05:03:15,940 --> 05:03:17,940
Because they are like little doofy faces

3891
05:03:17,940 --> 05:03:19,940
Because it sucks

3892
05:03:19,940 --> 05:03:21,940
But it's funny at the same time

3893
05:03:21,940 --> 05:03:23,940
I didn't want that to happen to her

3894
05:03:23,940 --> 05:03:25,940
Normal fish have fairly high maintenance

3895
05:03:25,940 --> 05:03:27,940
But betas are real chance

3896
05:03:27,940 --> 05:03:29,940
Yeah betas like survive on fucking anything

3897
05:03:29,940 --> 05:03:31,940
It's crazy

3898
05:03:31,940 --> 05:03:33,940
Fish enthusiasts

3899
05:03:33,940 --> 05:03:35,940
And one of them likes to raise shrimp

3900
05:03:35,940 --> 05:03:37,940
Um

3901
05:03:37,940 --> 05:03:39,940
Like aquascaping seemed really cool to me

3902
05:03:39,940 --> 05:03:41,940
But I just I don't have the patience

3903
05:03:41,940 --> 05:03:43,940
To maintain stuff

3904
05:03:43,940 --> 05:03:45,940
Gardening Shibi's mommy somewhere

3905
05:03:45,940 --> 05:03:47,940
No

3906
05:03:47,940 --> 05:03:49,940
I've seen so many brutal ant

3907
05:03:49,940 --> 05:03:51,940
Wasps nest instructions

3908
05:03:51,940 --> 05:03:53,940
Bids, yeah

3909
05:03:53,940 --> 05:03:55,940
Drop, yeah I've seen people

3910
05:03:55,940 --> 05:03:59,940
I've actually seen the aluminum stuff before

3911
05:03:59,940 --> 05:04:01,940
People pouring aluminum into the

3912
05:04:01,940 --> 05:04:03,940
Into the nests

3913
05:04:03,940 --> 05:04:05,940
And then thinking it out

3914
05:04:05,940 --> 05:04:07,940
It's very interesting

3915
05:04:07,940 --> 05:04:09,940
Well if I

3916
05:04:09,940 --> 05:04:11,940
The model if I like cover my face

3917
05:04:11,940 --> 05:04:13,940
I'll fall asleep

3918
05:04:15,940 --> 05:04:17,940
I lose tracking

3919
05:04:17,940 --> 05:04:19,940
So I usually before I know I'm gonna lose tracking

3920
05:04:19,940 --> 05:04:21,940
I try to close my eyes

3921
05:04:21,940 --> 05:04:23,940
So I look like I'm sleeping

3922
05:04:23,940 --> 05:04:25,940
I see does it automatically but mine doesn't

3923
05:04:25,940 --> 05:04:27,940
I have to like be like

3924
05:04:27,940 --> 05:04:29,940
And then move myself to the side

3925
05:04:47,940 --> 05:04:49,940
It's like sleeping face

3926
05:04:53,940 --> 05:04:55,940
I know it is kind of weird

3927
05:04:55,940 --> 05:04:57,940
To think about the aluminum ones

3928
05:04:59,940 --> 05:05:01,940
I like to watch this channel called snake discovery

3929
05:05:01,940 --> 05:05:03,940
I learned a lot from them

3930
05:05:03,940 --> 05:05:05,940
I like during

3931
05:05:05,940 --> 05:05:07,940
Covid and lockdown and stuff

3932
05:05:07,940 --> 05:05:09,940
I just watched, I consumed a lot of

3933
05:05:09,940 --> 05:05:11,940
Animal facts stuff

3934
05:05:11,940 --> 05:05:13,940
So like I learned a lot about snakes

3935
05:05:13,940 --> 05:05:15,940
I'm 100% sure

3936
05:05:15,940 --> 05:05:17,940
If somebody handed me a clutch of bottle python eggs

3937
05:05:17,940 --> 05:05:19,940
I could raise them no problem

3938
05:05:21,940 --> 05:05:23,940
And like invertebrates and

3939
05:05:23,940 --> 05:05:25,940
Reptiles

3940
05:05:25,940 --> 05:05:27,940
And it was really cool

3941
05:05:27,940 --> 05:05:29,940
Yeah snake discovery is awesome

3942
05:05:29,940 --> 05:05:31,940
Really awesome

3943
05:05:31,940 --> 05:05:33,940
Like if um

3944
05:05:35,940 --> 05:05:37,940
If they ever do like

3945
05:05:37,940 --> 05:05:39,940
If I ever become big and they do a charity event

3946
05:05:39,940 --> 05:05:41,940
I will 100% like donate to them

3947
05:05:41,940 --> 05:05:43,940
Cause that would just be cool

3948
05:05:43,940 --> 05:05:45,940
And uh yeah

3949
05:05:45,940 --> 05:05:47,940
I watched fool the flower horn

3950
05:05:47,940 --> 05:05:49,940
Snake discovery

3951
05:05:49,940 --> 05:05:51,940
Ants Canada

3952
05:05:51,940 --> 05:05:53,940
Dark Den

3953
05:05:53,940 --> 05:05:55,940
There was another one I used to watch

3954
05:05:55,940 --> 05:05:57,940
But I don't think they posted it anymore

3955
05:05:57,940 --> 05:05:59,940
I don't remember

3956
05:05:59,940 --> 05:06:01,940
They also had like a lot of

3957
05:06:01,940 --> 05:06:03,940
Ranchos

3958
05:06:05,940 --> 05:06:07,940
Yeah I was just

3959
05:06:07,940 --> 05:06:09,940
Catching up on

3960
05:06:09,940 --> 05:06:11,940
Like

3961
05:06:11,940 --> 05:06:13,940
I was watching an Ants Canada video

3962
05:06:13,940 --> 05:06:15,940
Where he released like a huntsman

3963
05:06:15,940 --> 05:06:17,940
And her baby is into an enclosure

3964
05:06:17,940 --> 05:06:19,940
And I was like I was just fucking sick

3965
05:06:19,940 --> 05:06:21,940
Cause I hadn't like consumed like bug media

3966
05:06:21,940 --> 05:06:23,940
In a long time

3967
05:06:23,940 --> 05:06:25,940
I really like bugs

3968
05:06:25,940 --> 05:06:27,940
Bugs are cool

3969
05:06:27,940 --> 05:06:29,940
And animals in general

3970
05:06:29,940 --> 05:06:31,940
I like watching um animal documentaries

3971
05:06:31,940 --> 05:06:33,940
And also like

3972
05:06:33,940 --> 05:06:35,940
A comfort thing that I do cause

3973
05:06:35,940 --> 05:06:37,940
Soleil would sit and watch

3974
05:06:37,940 --> 05:06:39,940
Like you know like night on earth

3975
05:06:39,940 --> 05:06:41,940
On Netflix

3976
05:06:41,940 --> 05:06:43,940
Like Soleil loved to watch that

3977
05:06:43,940 --> 05:06:45,940
With me

3978
05:06:45,940 --> 05:06:47,940
She loved to watch animal documentaries with me

3979
05:06:47,940 --> 05:06:49,940
She used to pay attention to the tv

3980
05:06:49,940 --> 05:06:51,940
She just hang out

3981
05:06:51,940 --> 05:06:53,940
Beetles are cool

3982
05:06:53,940 --> 05:06:55,940
I actually don't know a lot about beetles

3983
05:06:55,940 --> 05:06:57,940
I know very little about beetles

3984
05:06:57,940 --> 05:06:59,940
I mostly like isopods

3985
05:06:59,940 --> 05:07:01,940
And uh spiders

3986
05:07:01,940 --> 05:07:03,940
And like um

3987
05:07:03,940 --> 05:07:05,940
Praying mantises

3988
05:07:07,940 --> 05:07:09,940
My genetic spiral arm case in our huntsman

3989
05:07:09,940 --> 05:07:11,940
Yeah those enclosures are crazy

3990
05:07:11,940 --> 05:07:13,940
I know a little bit about like long horn beetles

3991
05:07:15,940 --> 05:07:17,940
I think the coolest thing I've seen

3992
05:07:17,940 --> 05:07:19,940
Um I saw those like beetle tattoo ones

3993
05:07:19,940 --> 05:07:21,940
Of this girl who had like

3994
05:07:21,940 --> 05:07:23,940
When she closed

3995
05:07:23,940 --> 05:07:25,940
Like I don't really know how to explain it

3996
05:07:25,940 --> 05:07:27,940
But when it was on her

3997
05:07:27,940 --> 05:07:29,940
The side of her knee

3998
05:07:29,940 --> 05:07:31,940
When her thigh and her calves were touching

3999
05:07:31,940 --> 05:07:33,940
It looked like the beetle was

4000
05:07:33,940 --> 05:07:35,940
Closed and then when she would spread

4001
05:07:35,940 --> 05:07:37,940
Like um stretch out her leg

4002
05:07:37,940 --> 05:07:39,940
And she would like

4003
05:07:39,940 --> 05:07:41,940
Stretch out her leg

4004
05:07:41,940 --> 05:07:43,940
It looked like the beetle was

4005
05:07:43,940 --> 05:07:45,940
Extending its wings and it was like the coolest

4006
05:07:45,940 --> 05:07:47,940
Fucking tattoo I've ever seen in my life

4007
05:07:49,940 --> 05:07:51,940
I've seen that with like moths and stuff too

4008
05:07:51,940 --> 05:07:53,940
People do that

4009
05:07:53,940 --> 05:07:55,940
You've seen that tattoo? Yeah

4010
05:07:55,940 --> 05:07:57,940
I've also seen um

4011
05:07:57,940 --> 05:07:59,940
Yeah roaches like how people raise

4012
05:07:59,940 --> 05:08:01,940
Dew beer roaches

4013
05:08:01,940 --> 05:08:03,940
It's really cool

4014
05:08:03,940 --> 05:08:05,940
I like tattoos a lot, tattoos are really cool

4015
05:08:05,940 --> 05:08:07,940
I think it's a beautiful art form

4016
05:08:07,940 --> 05:08:09,940

4018
05:08:13,940 --> 05:08:15,940
Ladybirds, do people call them ladybirds?

4019
05:08:15,940 --> 05:08:17,940
I know you can order ladybugs on amazon

4020
05:08:17,940 --> 05:08:19,940
My mom likes um ladybugs

4021
05:08:21,940 --> 05:08:23,940
Was it a single beetle?

4022
05:08:23,940 --> 05:08:25,940
Yeah it was

4023
05:08:25,940 --> 05:08:27,940

05:08:27,940 --> 05:08:29,940

4025
05:08:33,940 --> 05:08:35,940

That's a miraculous ladybug

4028
05:08:39,940 --> 05:08:41,940

Too distracted so sometimes I just need to focus

4077
05:10:29,940 --> 05:10:31,940
And I just talk

4078
05:10:31,940 --> 05:10:33,940

Cause I always was told I talk too much

05:10:53,940 --> 05:10:55,940
Like cause I used to be really shy

4090
05:10:55,940 --> 05:10:57,940
Cause I didn't talk at all

4091
05:10:57,940 --> 05:10:59,940
And then when I did start talking I got told I talked too much

4092
05:10:59,940 --> 05:11:01,940

4093
05:11:01,940 --> 05:11:03,940

05:11:17,940 --> 05:11:19,940
I need to think of like

05:11:19,940 --> 05:11:21,940
So

05:11:21,940 --> 05:11:23,940
So harem is your collective name

4103
05:11:23,940 --> 05:11:25,940
But what is the singular

4104
05:11:25,940 --> 05:11:27,940
Of the harem name

4105
05:11:27,940 --> 05:11:29,940
What's the singular

4106
05:11:29,940 --> 05:11:31,940
A harem

4108

An m

4109
05:11:35,940 --> 05:11:37,940
Can you guys stop hissing at each other

4110
05:11:37,940 --> 05:11:39,940
Woomi

4111
05:11:39,940 --> 05:11:41,940
Can you have a toy right here at resp.

4112
05:11:41,940 --> 05:11:43,940
I don't want to roll over her she's below my chair

4113
05:11:43,940 --> 05:11:45,940
Not behind me

4114
05:11:45,940 --> 05:11:47,940
Woomi come here

4115
05:11:47,940 --> 05:11:49,940
Yap

4116
05:11:49,940 --> 05:11:51,940
I want a toy right there

4117
05:11:51,940 --> 05:11:53,940
Yap

4118
05:11:53,940 --> 05:11:55,940
They literally have a toy box

4119
05:11:55,940 --> 05:11:57,940
And they know they can take some out of their toy box

4120
05:11:57,940 --> 05:11:59,940
Cause they're smart enough to do that

4121
05:11:59,940 --> 05:12:01,940
Fiya usually will go into her toy box

4122
05:12:01,940 --> 05:12:03,940
And take some out

4123
05:12:03,940 --> 05:12:05,940
I mean it just wards all her toys in her bed

4124
05:12:05,940 --> 05:12:07,940
Woomi

4125
05:12:07,940 --> 05:12:09,940
Woomi woomi woomi

4126
05:12:09,940 --> 05:12:11,940
Woomi get it

4127
05:12:11,940 --> 05:12:13,940
Woomi

4128
05:12:13,940 --> 05:12:15,940
That was an impressive roll

4129
05:12:15,940 --> 05:12:17,940
Woomi just somersaulted to get a toy

4130
05:12:17,940 --> 05:12:19,940
Woomi

4131
05:12:19,940 --> 05:12:21,940
Fiya came out of the

4132
05:12:21,940 --> 05:12:23,940
Out of nowhere and Woomi went into that

4133
05:12:23,940 --> 05:12:25,940
Like that typical arched cat back

4134
05:12:25,940 --> 05:12:27,940
Cause he's such a

4135
05:12:27,940 --> 05:12:29,940
He's literally such a menace but he's such a pussy

4136
05:12:29,940 --> 05:12:31,940
Like he's scared of everything

4137
05:12:33,940 --> 05:12:35,940
Like if I'm

4138
05:12:35,940 --> 05:12:37,940
If somebody came in broken

4139
05:12:37,940 --> 05:12:39,940
Reina my 14 year old elderly cat

4140
05:12:39,940 --> 05:12:41,940
Would launch themselves at them

4141
05:12:41,940 --> 05:12:43,940
Woomi jumps behind the dryer

4142
05:12:43,940 --> 05:12:45,940
Fiya would probably just watch

4143
05:12:45,940 --> 05:12:47,940
See how everything plays out

4144
05:12:47,940 --> 05:12:49,940
Fiya

4145
05:12:49,940 --> 05:12:51,940

05:12:51,940 --> 05:12:53,940

Harlots

4149
05:12:57,940 --> 05:12:59,940

Okay I guess yeah

4153
05:13:05,940 --> 05:13:07,940
You guys will be called a Harlots

4154
05:13:07,940 --> 05:13:09,940
Not a Harlots, a Harlots

4155
05:13:09,940 --> 05:13:11,940
It's spelled Harlots

4156
05:13:11,940 --> 05:13:13,940

4206
05:22:31,780 --> 05:22:35,780
like it's like they kind of just like modernize it a little bit i'm like okay and i actually ended

4207
05:22:35,780 --> 05:22:38,900
up really like in the show because i'm very someone like me and my mom are usually very much

4208
05:22:38,900 --> 05:22:48,260
sticklers for wow out of context that sounds really bad guys in half black um i feel like i have

4209
05:22:48,260 --> 05:22:55,540
to say that every time i say something i'm gonna it's gonna be funny when i get my when i get

4210
05:22:55,540 --> 05:23:03,540
my um am i wrong though when i get my tan toggle anytime i say something problematic

4211
05:23:10,020 --> 05:23:12,420
whatever this is being caught out anyways don't worry about it

4212
05:23:14,340 --> 05:23:18,900
it's pretty serious there's indian well no no no like the the indian like the

4213
05:23:19,860 --> 05:23:24,260
indian royal families were understandable like forget it like it doesn't even matter version's

4214
05:23:24,260 --> 05:23:30,420
a great show once i got the premise because i thought they were trying to be true to the time period

4215
05:23:31,940 --> 05:23:38,980
like tutors ask because i liked tutors um and like the white princess the white queen

4216
05:23:40,900 --> 05:23:49,220
and the past can't wait to get my past toggle um three fours of the whole

4217
05:23:49,220 --> 05:23:50,180

4218
05:23:54,020 --> 05:23:58,900

05:25:11,540 --> 05:25:17,860
uh she's black it's fuck is there so much easier when i had a tan model

4230
05:25:19,700 --> 05:25:24,260
although i could actually i could probably just change my skin tone in my um

4231
05:25:27,060 --> 05:25:34,420
in my uh meshes for the model i could probably do that actually

4232
05:25:42,420 --> 05:25:46,020
i might wait it's probably not going up doing fucking blackface if i do this

4233
05:25:49,700 --> 05:25:50,420
fuck it weeble

4234
05:26:03,860 --> 05:26:06,260

no keep going

4248
05:27:51,460 --> 05:28:02,100
you know it's funny when i became a streamer my ultimate goal

4249
05:28:04,100 --> 05:28:09,140
was to be a role model for other little black girls just like myself who liked video games

4250
05:28:09,140 --> 05:28:16,100
and were female and i wanted to be a role model role model for women of color i am not that

4251
05:28:16,900 --> 05:28:21,540
i failed myself

4252
05:28:29,860 --> 05:28:37,220
i think i just sometimes you just don't you don't it's fun not to take yourself seriously you know

4253
05:28:42,980 --> 05:28:45,780
this is really fun to do though i'm just moving my mouse around for this

4254
05:28:46,340 --> 05:28:47,700
ah kings are glowing

4255
05:28:51,380 --> 05:28:52,500
this is hypnotizing you

4256
05:28:56,500 --> 05:29:00,820
keep up the dream yeah it's always been my goal especially because there's like

4257
05:29:00,820 --> 05:29:06,020
what i loved about being in this company is that um not only do you have

4258
05:29:08,420 --> 05:29:11,780
one black girl that has a black model you have two black girls and one has a white model

4259
05:29:12,260 --> 05:29:22,260
um and usually there is no other there's no other company that has a tan or a racial

4260
05:29:22,260 --> 05:29:29,780
ambiguous model or black model and i think that's pretty cool that we're kind of branching out

4261
05:29:29,780 --> 05:29:37,700
because people are like oh people won't like a tan model look at fucking koinako or waifu baby

4262
05:29:38,660 --> 05:29:46,980
like giaru or tan or whatever like it's still a popular niche yeah before serena

4263
05:29:49,060 --> 05:29:55,460
rest in peace um avi cadavera she was a fucking amazing creator and it's really sad

4264
05:29:55,460 --> 05:30:02,020
to see her go by the way uh amazing comedian and sketch artists she was very very unique

4265
05:30:02,100 --> 05:30:08,420
and um vtuber sphere it's i'm congrats to her though for landing some sort of thing

4266
05:30:08,420 --> 05:30:15,060
woomi what are you doing i'm gonna give you a hug come here big man kiss you how are you doing

4267
05:30:15,620 --> 05:30:16,820
how are you doing mr titties

4268
05:30:20,020 --> 05:30:23,700
um yeah sanas sanas.com sana sana i can never pronounce my name right

4269
05:30:24,660 --> 05:30:31,780
but uh yeah i feel like azura and serena feel those niches and i feel like it just shows

4270
05:30:32,100 --> 05:30:36,740
that there can be there's plenty in the indie sphere let's bring it more into the corporal sphere

4271
05:30:36,740 --> 05:30:43,060
you know yeah abby's graduating serena staying this sucks because there's only two of them in their

4272
05:30:43,060 --> 05:30:47,620
gen and now serena's alone so i kind of hope they do like for v4 mariah like in some sort of

4273
05:30:47,620 --> 05:30:53,300
invader gen um just so like she doesn't have to feel like she's alone

4274
05:30:55,860 --> 05:31:01,300
yeah i'm i'm eventually getting like i know emmy um can rig i know she said she

4275
05:31:01,300 --> 05:31:06,020
just like like um she i can just hand over the model files to her and she'll just

4276
05:31:06,020 --> 05:31:13,860
like slap toggle on so i might just do that although i think um i think um strani is talking to

4277
05:31:14,660 --> 05:31:24,740
our um rig papa mama because she's a girl nori um about getting me a cover-up official cover-up

4278
05:31:24,820 --> 05:31:27,220
for my biddies in a tan toggle

4279
05:31:30,500 --> 05:31:37,380
not that i don't like like you know this model and i would just i'd be like i kind of i want to i

4280
05:31:37,380 --> 05:31:40,820
would pull like an iron mouse and just switch between the two because it kind of makes sense

4281
05:31:40,820 --> 05:31:42,980
because i am irish also

4282
05:31:48,180 --> 05:31:54,020
yeah i wish like some people who had like um like swimsuit models like had like a tan toggle on them

4283
05:31:54,020 --> 05:32:00,260
like that would be really cool depends on the audience so i wasn't forced to retire yeah that's true

4284
05:32:03,700 --> 05:32:09,220
it's hard to get to colored models yeah yeah because like um for my model i had before

4285
05:32:09,220 --> 05:32:19,940
in my past life i literally mostly use a little one uh my former artist mama uh swal koi

4286
05:32:19,940 --> 05:32:27,140
fucking amazing because i was like i was a cute funny vtuber um they did such a fucking good job

4287
05:32:27,140 --> 05:32:33,940
and sorry that model will never be seen the model i i was going to do a whole debut but then

4288
05:32:33,940 --> 05:32:40,180
i got into a veal or that model will never be seen um but they did such a fucking good job on my model

4289
05:32:40,180 --> 05:32:47,700
because um they nailed the skin tone how horny was it

4290
05:32:50,660 --> 05:32:58,820
uh it wasn't actually uh because i was i was a cute and funny priestess so i kind of had almost

4291
05:32:58,820 --> 05:33:07,620
like a gypsy look to me i don't really know how to explain it um there's there was tommy showing

4292
05:33:07,620 --> 05:33:15,380
i don't know um and then i had my nun model that i used a lot and i just like edited the mesh like

4293
05:33:15,380 --> 05:33:25,380
how you just saw me almost doing something terrible and i just did that and um i just made it tan

4294
05:33:28,020 --> 05:33:34,100
but yeah there isn't it's mostly like i think yeah getting like the coloring right because

4295
05:33:34,100 --> 05:33:41,300
sometimes it can be gray or like too orange or red it's it's those different tones in uh tan

4296
05:33:41,300 --> 05:33:48,900
colors um that's why i provide i provided as many references as possible with the skin tone that i wanted

4297
05:33:52,420 --> 05:33:56,900
all right she's a shark she's spanish yeah i feel like there's also like a lot of spanish

4298
05:33:57,300 --> 05:34:02,500
and like it honestly kind of makes sense to me to have more tan models because you have a lot

4299
05:34:02,500 --> 05:34:09,860
of spanish fans and you also have a lot of um uh agent fans that are more darker skins because

4300
05:34:09,860 --> 05:34:19,860
like not every japanese korean filipino tai vietnamese lai ocean etc etc etc etc is snow white

4301
05:34:22,500 --> 05:34:32,100
ending of purple yeah i actually at one point i was tempted to um brand into like when i first started

4302
05:34:32,100 --> 05:34:35,700
v2 being just to be like a dark elf and just be like drow colored

4303
05:34:36,020 --> 05:34:49,220
that's because i feel like people have it or more easily do that than something else i don't know why

4304
05:34:49,220 --> 05:34:51,380
why do my eyes look like weird colors

4305
05:34:54,100 --> 05:34:59,620
i feel like one's darker than the other with the whole i think i have the like the light in the

4306
05:34:59,700 --> 05:35:01,460
center of my eyes and shade it properly

4307
05:35:05,700 --> 05:35:10,500
modernizing the end of it yeah half heart yeah tricksy who

4308
05:35:11,300 --> 05:35:18,340
the tricksy yeah i know what you're doing um jarby super tight yeah

4309
05:35:20,900 --> 05:35:22,500
um trust fit on the nose yeah

4310
05:35:22,500 --> 05:35:33,060
i don't want to um flashbang by turning on my turning off the overlay i have on this

4311
05:35:36,580 --> 05:35:37,060
but like

4312
05:35:41,620 --> 05:35:42,740
i don't know how to word that

4313
05:35:44,900 --> 05:35:48,500
but yeah i just think it's cool and like i also think it's like i was almost like i just

4314
05:35:48,500 --> 05:35:55,940
a like i wanted i drew this really cool picture of this um i made a slime based vtuber

4315
05:35:57,060 --> 05:36:00,980
um made her an oc of mine can you what the fuck are you guys doing

4316
05:36:03,140 --> 05:36:06,820
i can hear you fucking about what's up marina go check it out

4317
05:36:08,340 --> 05:36:10,820
marina's walking towards the laundry room she's gonna go investigate

4318
05:36:11,780 --> 05:36:21,540
um um what the fuck was i saying oh yeah i was gonna be a this was before like this was

4319
05:36:21,540 --> 05:36:26,580
just me when i was going indy for the first time by the way because i didn't like again i didn't

4320
05:36:26,580 --> 05:36:36,020
conceptualize or create myself as you see now um and no no no she wouldn't she wouldn't be a model

4321
05:36:36,020 --> 05:36:42,660
like she be will be my only only one and only model although i'm i'm begging strony for a slime

4322
05:36:42,660 --> 05:36:49,780
girl gen two please hello i will sell this oc so this comes to life so i had an oc her name was

4323
05:36:49,780 --> 05:36:56,580
saliva and i called her live saliva saliva and she was a slime girl but she was made of spit

4324
05:36:58,100 --> 05:37:03,780
she was like blue colored so she was like spit personified um

4325
05:37:03,780 --> 05:37:08,340
um and i was like oh i was good so i was gonna be that

4326
05:37:11,540 --> 05:37:14,580
so i'm like hey that would actually be a pretty cool idea for gen two

4327
05:37:16,580 --> 05:37:20,020
oh it sounds kind of gross well fuck you

4328
05:37:22,660 --> 05:37:28,740

05:37:28,740 --> 05:37:33,380
form or whatever the fuck um imagine the smell

4330
05:37:37,460 --> 05:37:43,620

4339
05:38:46,420 --> 05:38:57,700
for all her iterations um i watched her grow as a vtuber and when she had other things go on

4340
05:38:58,980 --> 05:39:04,340
and she mentioned hey i want to do my own um company i was like oh that'd be sick

4341
05:39:04,340 --> 05:39:09,460
so i worked really hard because i um i really only

4342
05:39:11,460 --> 05:39:17,700
like i i'd streamed it as a flushtuber in the past and i do have content creation um history

4343
05:39:17,700 --> 05:39:24,980
and experience but i was never a vtuber so i'm like if i work really hard i'm gonna stream

4344
05:39:24,980 --> 05:39:30,900
i'm gonna get a model like just got one right off at etsy change the colors of it um gonna make

4345
05:39:30,900 --> 05:39:37,940
content gonna do my own thing and i'm gonna if when she ever makes this company i want to apply

4346
05:39:38,900 --> 05:39:44,660
and because mean i and she'll say the same thing about me because she's called me her 2.0

4347
05:39:46,420 --> 05:39:51,380
i saw a lot of shared values in her she was like we have a lot of similar tastes

4348
05:39:52,340 --> 05:39:56,020
as you can see we like to stream for very long times and we just like to talk and

4349
05:39:56,020 --> 05:40:00,820
yep and hang out with people and we like um as you said like a lot of the same things

4350
05:40:02,420 --> 05:40:11,140
and uh it was it was just like what like it's i know like it was the type of

4351
05:40:12,580 --> 05:40:18,420
relationship like watching a uh a content creator i hadn't felt in a long time where i'm like

4352
05:40:19,300 --> 05:40:22,180
oh i'm gonna watch you and i feel like i'm just hanging out with a friend

4353
05:40:22,900 --> 05:40:28,500
and i'm like i want to be that person so bad where you just come home and you're like oh my friend

4354
05:40:28,500 --> 05:40:34,580
streaming i'm like we're gonna hang out we're gonna chat we're gonna talk simping paid off um

4355
05:40:35,700 --> 05:40:41,540
and like just seeing her like roadmap and what she wanted to accomplish i was like i want to do

4356
05:40:41,540 --> 05:40:50,020
everything in my power to try to be in this company um i i honestly don't know how i ended up here

4357
05:40:51,140 --> 05:40:58,180
it literally i was bawling my eyes out when i got accepted it was it was it was crazy it was

4358
05:40:58,180 --> 05:41:04,660
genuinely wild um but it's but like i'll be honest with you i did apply to other companies

4359
05:41:04,660 --> 05:41:09,940
because i didn't think i would get in i also applied for the experience um because i didn't

4360
05:41:09,940 --> 05:41:19,460
know what it was like applying to a vtuber agency um yeah i was i was a i was an og refling

4361
05:41:21,940 --> 05:41:27,620
some of you already know that um i ended up here because you're awesome oh thank you um

4362
05:41:28,820 --> 05:41:33,620
and then you blackmailed her yes and then i blackmailed her so i got her um

4363
05:41:33,620 --> 05:41:41,060
um i think yeah she said she so she made notes on our interviews of like why she

4364
05:41:41,060 --> 05:41:47,860
oh my internet's starting to go because it's getting late uh they're like shut up we're taking

4365
05:41:47,860 --> 05:41:53,300
away your internet so she said i got to see some notes of what she wrote down about me during

4366
05:41:53,300 --> 05:41:58,420
her interview and when she took when she was like doing research on the people that applied and

4367
05:41:58,420 --> 05:42:04,820
she wrote down i'm way too knowledgeable about the industry for only being around for six months

4368
05:42:06,020 --> 05:42:11,060
which is true although it's been um more than six months now that i've been a vtuber

4369
05:42:12,260 --> 05:42:20,900
and uh i was very good at voice acting and at a range but i needed to work on my cute and funny

4370
05:42:20,900 --> 05:42:25,620
voice is what she said because i mostly streamed it was like cute and funny but i had a lot of

4371
05:42:25,620 --> 05:42:31,620
vocal fry when i did my cute and funny voice but now i don't not now it's um i've trained it since

4372
05:42:31,620 --> 05:42:42,340
then and um and she saw again like a lot of herself in me and i think she said that i wonder

4373
05:42:42,340 --> 05:42:50,580
if i can find it she said that you know i was what she should have been in another life and i was like

4374
05:42:50,740 --> 05:42:59,860
and i i disagreed with her on that how long i've been so i've been a streamer for almost like for

4375
05:42:59,860 --> 05:43:08,020
about five years i had to take a break because of school and work and then i got back into vtubers

4376
05:43:08,020 --> 05:43:18,020
again and i um yes i was like when she told like when when i asked the manager for the notes

4377
05:43:18,980 --> 05:43:22,980
because i'm like okay how can i improve and i saw that i literally broke down crying

4378
05:43:26,500 --> 05:43:37,140
um so it was i was blown away by that fucking um statement and i it is my goal to live up to it now

4379
05:43:38,740 --> 05:43:42,740
did you try any other kind of voice acting besides stream uh actually no i don't have

4380
05:43:43,700 --> 05:43:50,500
any other voice acting under my belt i only did it for fun in my streams i was always good at

4381
05:43:50,500 --> 05:43:56,580
doing wacky voices when i hung out with my friends i was that the funny one in the friend group

4382
05:43:57,300 --> 05:44:01,540
the girl who managed to have a sense of humor um

4383
05:44:03,700 --> 05:44:08,580
then you said the acceptance note it's april first yes and then two days later i think i i

4384
05:44:08,580 --> 05:44:15,380
interviewed the strawney she was like you're in like excuse me she's like yeah uh here's the model

4385
05:44:16,020 --> 05:44:21,620
slide shebe's first um model iteration because we did like had some adjustment since then

4386
05:44:21,620 --> 05:44:25,700
like i had i used to have a lipstick then i pointed out that i'm like i had like the same

4387
05:44:25,700 --> 05:44:34,660
lips as a zura so they yoinked my lipstick away um i can't wait to be picked up a cruncher

4388
05:44:34,660 --> 05:44:40,500
although it would be it would literally it would be so crazy if i got to voice for an anime

4389
05:44:41,300 --> 05:44:48,100
that is like oh my god that'd be so insane that'd be so amazing queen must my emergency

4390
05:44:48,100 --> 05:44:59,140
oh queen uh so um some of you know like i wasn't uh technically supposed to be shebe it was supposed

4391
05:44:59,220 --> 05:45:08,020
to be another um asa mark creator uh but life uh commitment's gone the way so she couldn't sign on

4392
05:45:10,340 --> 05:45:18,420
so uh she goes dub stories dub that'd be so fucking funny i don't love you because you're a rabbit

4393
05:45:19,300 --> 05:45:28,420
i don't love you because you're wow why am i i am so fucking bad today what the fuck dude

4394
05:45:30,100 --> 05:45:35,300
um anime series voice acting i don't really particular series does anything fantasy related

4395
05:45:35,300 --> 05:45:37,860
i'm never gonna be hired at this rate um

4396
05:45:43,140 --> 05:45:48,660
i think i use that sort of humor as a coping mechanism or like a defense mechanism because

4397
05:45:50,020 --> 05:45:54,580
younger me would just ball her eyes out if somebody said that to me and i think i've just adapted

4398
05:45:55,460 --> 05:46:04,100
um yeah oh yeah so uh thank you for reminding me so yeah i wasn't supposed to be shebe um

4399
05:46:05,300 --> 05:46:13,300
but but shebe wasn't shebe back then because the other asa martis and strani were conceptualizing

4400
05:46:13,300 --> 05:46:20,580
the og shebe together and then other asa martis could not sign on because um and this is like way

4401
05:46:20,580 --> 05:46:29,700
early in development like before buehler had a fucking like name um and so then you know strani was

4402
05:46:29,700 --> 05:46:37,780
on the hunt for a different creator and i just happened to fit that and but it's she's always

4403
05:46:37,780 --> 05:46:41,060
reassured me she's like you're always gonna be my sheepsters like you're always my shivers

4404
05:46:41,620 --> 05:46:49,140
you're always gonna be my she my sheepsters um yeah when it was still a b sucky yeah um but yeah

4405
05:46:49,140 --> 05:46:56,260
she i originally had like i was i was as thick as a zura and i was purple i was purple

4406
05:46:58,580 --> 05:47:05,940
um and then yeah then they changed it and worked through the conceptualization and then

4407
05:47:06,900 --> 05:47:15,860
i'm like i hired on and it's me and i'm a bunny yeah i was barney your voice seriously suits shebe to a

4408
05:47:16,820 --> 05:47:23,620
i don't think my voice suits it at all i i'll be on it like when i first got my model

4409
05:47:24,420 --> 05:47:30,260
and i was watching myself talk out of it it was very weird and it still is weird to me

4410
05:47:31,620 --> 05:47:41,300
so you were out only yes oh my god out only such a fucking great game um yeah i never like i'm

4411
05:47:41,300 --> 05:47:47,620
still getting used to hearing my honestly i think my normal speaking voice fits better

4412
05:47:48,340 --> 05:47:56,100
but some i use like my patreon voice when i get really like like i don't like my like my voice

4413
05:47:56,100 --> 05:48:03,780
in the trailer and in my um like one of my shorts i'm like my i like really deep in my voice

4414
05:48:03,780 --> 05:48:07,220
and i really put my voice on and it's like they always say like you always put on a voice

4415
05:48:08,020 --> 05:48:12,100
when you first stream and then you either get higher or you lower your voice like a lot of girls

4416
05:48:12,100 --> 05:48:16,180
mostly pitch their voices up because they want to be cute and they want to talk like this

4417
05:48:19,300 --> 05:48:22,340
and then they'll be like hey what's up like later like a couple months down the line

4418
05:48:23,540 --> 05:48:33,460
um you went musky deep hefty hefty hefty uh i think you lost us on that one

4419
05:48:34,420 --> 05:48:37,380
well i mean a large white guy for some of my voice talk of a giant bird

4420
05:48:37,380 --> 05:48:44,420
yeah exactly like it's it's uh i've also was so used to seeing my voice come out

4421
05:48:45,460 --> 05:48:55,060
of my pl that i think that was like if if i had not started v2 being they just gave me this model

4422
05:48:55,060 --> 05:49:04,420
i think it would have been way so pl means past life um and i yeah i don't think i would have had the

4423
05:49:04,420 --> 05:49:09,940
problem but because i was cute and funny in tan and then being this i was like huh

4424
05:49:12,500 --> 05:49:18,740
um one of my favorite things about being trans is still having a deep voice i can slip into

4425
05:49:18,740 --> 05:49:24,580
one of my uh one of my gorex is is trans and she always pulls that on me

4426
05:49:25,940 --> 05:49:31,700
because and it throws me off each time because she'll come up to me behind me at work

4427
05:49:32,980 --> 05:49:37,700
and she'll be like hey excuse me and i'll be like what the f**k if then it's her and i'm like

4428
05:49:38,180 --> 05:49:45,140
f**k you and she's like hey sorry skat skadaddles away i'm like b**ch um

4429
05:49:48,820 --> 05:49:49,860
yeah pl past life

4430
05:49:52,340 --> 05:50:03,300
my mom nice to go yeah like oh when i saw the model when strawnee showed me the model i was like holy s**t

4431
05:50:03,620 --> 05:50:12,100
i'm a hot as f**k like holy and you want me to be that also why is she wearing so many

4432
05:50:12,100 --> 05:50:19,700
bonnage ropes i also um i might ask nari to get a toggle where i can take off the ropes

4433
05:50:21,620 --> 05:50:28,820
they're starting to chafe none the good way but i can like i want to be able to toggle them in my uh

4434
05:50:29,460 --> 05:50:38,580
gag just for like um content reasons because i feel like i honestly i i personally out of all the girls

4435
05:50:38,580 --> 05:50:47,860
don't think i'll get monetization because of my model because i'm wearing a ballgag

4436
05:50:49,300 --> 05:50:54,900
i don't know and then azura has really big boos who knows silk rope not have yeah

4437
05:50:58,820 --> 05:51:06,980
what lore yeah i know um it's funny when i became a vtuber i was like you know what i

4438
05:51:06,980 --> 05:51:10,900
want to do definitely i really want to stick to a character like i really just want to role play a

4439
05:51:10,900 --> 05:51:17,940
character and i'm like then streaming yeah my cute my really cute necklace my cute choker it's

4440
05:51:17,940 --> 05:51:28,180
very unique then streaming i realized i just somebody had said about me that they wish i would

4441
05:51:28,180 --> 05:51:36,340
be myself and then when i started being myself i had the most fun and when i started being myself

4442
05:51:37,380 --> 05:51:43,140
i made better content and i think that's why people have a hard time sticking to cave ape because

4443
05:51:43,140 --> 05:51:50,820
they realize when they're you're already kind of hiding yourself behind you know an anime character

4444
05:51:50,820 --> 05:51:57,300
on the internet like why can't you be yourself but also have aspects of that character you really

4445
05:51:57,300 --> 05:52:05,620
enjoy like um for this i do like learning how about how to be a dom and you know i like pretending

4446
05:52:05,620 --> 05:52:11,860
and role playing that like you're my either my clients or my staff at waterland hotel like that's

4447
05:52:11,860 --> 05:52:19,780
just so fun to me like oh did you uh go make sure that mr withamall was taking care of

4448
05:52:20,660 --> 05:52:23,060
him he needs his dick suck now

4449
05:52:25,860 --> 05:52:35,300
and he also needs his his bed made in his his clothing pressed um and and i think you know people

4450
05:52:36,260 --> 05:52:40,500
do complain sometimes like oh cave ape cave ape cave ape that's taking a cave ape

4451
05:52:41,300 --> 05:52:46,500
but then you look at the most popular vtubers and you see that people fell in love with them

4452
05:52:46,500 --> 05:52:54,340
because they were themselves you know like like gir for example she was always like you know really

4453
05:52:55,220 --> 05:53:05,220
cute in childlike like she like that sort of silly um person like personality you know if she

4454
05:53:06,340 --> 05:53:12,100
she's not gonna really lean into being a shark and being like i want to kill everybody or whatever

4455
05:53:12,100 --> 05:53:19,220
like she like yeah cave ape is a wrestling term it means like um kind of like your role

4456
05:53:19,220 --> 05:53:26,660
like with the act that you put on your your lore aka your story your backstory um because that's her

4457
05:53:26,660 --> 05:53:35,780
exactly it's her she didn't have to put any like and that's why at first i was frustrated when applying

4458
05:53:35,780 --> 05:53:45,060
to companies because i was like oh why are they like why am i not getting hired and then

4459
05:53:46,660 --> 05:53:52,900
and then watching like places i applied for because like i applied to idol i applied to pixel link i applied

4460
05:53:52,900 --> 05:54:02,100
to um like vnu and all that stuff and then i see the people who play and um are those vtubers

4461
05:54:02,100 --> 05:54:10,420
and i'm like i don't i do not see myself as that bird like i would not want to have hired anyone

4462
05:54:10,420 --> 05:54:17,220
else besides the person playing this um this character like not even because they they always

4463
05:54:17,220 --> 05:54:20,740
say oh they're looking for people to fit the character they're looking for people to fit the

4464
05:54:20,740 --> 05:54:25,780
role fit the voice and i totally get it now because after applying for so much and then getting

4465
05:54:26,580 --> 05:54:31,860
um shot down i was like i just didn't fit them and i and i see myself not fitting them

4466
05:54:33,540 --> 05:54:42,420
and i couldn't see myself growing into that character so it's really cool to kind of see

4467
05:54:42,420 --> 05:54:49,460
what people get cast as and how like their true personalities come out like i'm getting i remember

4468
05:54:49,540 --> 05:54:58,100
i watched a lot of vnu girls before i was um hired and i like um like mesmerizing i was i was um

4469
05:54:58,660 --> 05:55:04,980
chatting with her the other day in her in her stream and i'm like i could not see myself playing it

4470
05:55:04,980 --> 05:55:10,900
like you're also kind of like a mommy character but you're also like classy you know about drinks

4471
05:55:10,900 --> 05:55:18,980
like she's very like like she's so like i don't know like it's just it's just like everybody fits

4472
05:55:19,460 --> 05:55:25,700
so perfectly you know agencies are picky and also you know there's like nepotism and

4473
05:55:25,700 --> 05:55:29,940
shit like i didn't think i was gonna get into veal or because i didn't know if strani was going

4474
05:55:29,940 --> 05:55:34,740
to go the route of like hiring friends or hiring people that because you know it is it's more

4475
05:55:34,740 --> 05:55:39,460
smarter to hire people that already have a history and experience of being in a corporate agency

4476
05:55:40,500 --> 05:55:45,380
but she took a chance on me and i appreciate her for that dom the role i was born to play

4477
05:55:45,380 --> 05:55:56,820
oh that's funny no i like i like um i like switching and putting you guys like i'll be

4478
05:55:56,820 --> 05:56:04,580
like hey i'm a dark girl failure then i'm like open your mouth say ah okay hold it and i just

4479
05:56:04,580 --> 05:56:12,740
rule into your fucking mouth now swallow good boy like i like it's fun just like pulling it out of

4480
05:56:12,740 --> 05:56:22,340
nowhere he's a bishop principal is there reading material how to dom i mean i watch a lot of

4481
05:56:22,340 --> 05:56:29,620
fucking porn to learn and uh you guys have already also given me suggestions of stuff to watch

4482
05:56:30,660 --> 05:56:37,460
and i also learned i did i watch a lot of youtube videos about the culture of like um like bdsm culture

4483
05:56:37,460 --> 05:56:45,540
um like i know somebody was kind of frustrated with me at first because i made a joke that i didn't

4484
05:56:45,540 --> 05:56:48,980
believe in safe words yes i believe in like safe words are very important they're important with

4485
05:56:48,980 --> 05:56:54,260
consent and all that stuff um sometimes i like to be a bit and sometimes people are into that

4486
05:56:54,260 --> 05:56:59,940
sometimes people like so i will cater to different niches and fetishes and all that other stuff calm down

4487
05:56:59,940 --> 05:57:06,020
i'm not gonna hurt anybody i'm not actually in the bdsm community promoting like

4488
05:57:06,900 --> 05:57:07,460
abuse

4489
05:57:14,660 --> 05:57:20,980
good for homework yeah and it's like uh it's funny because looking at the girls i don't

4490
05:57:22,260 --> 05:57:26,820
like we would see people guessing about who was gonna play who like people thought i was gonna

4491
05:57:26,820 --> 05:57:31,380
be icy or someone or whatever the fuck um just because i was cute and funny in another life

4492
05:57:31,380 --> 05:57:41,220
another reincarnation reincarnation and i don't see like i don't see myself as like even loving

4493
05:57:41,220 --> 05:57:45,700
playing a cute funny character i don't see myself like they everybody was casted so perfectly

4494
05:57:46,660 --> 05:57:49,460
and people thought i was gonna be icy or emmy because i was cute funny

4495
05:57:51,060 --> 05:57:57,140
and i i i was very um yandere masochistic type

4496
05:57:57,220 --> 05:58:07,140

4500
05:58:22,580 --> 05:58:27,700
i might say some stuff that's inflammatory but it's jokes

4501
05:58:29,460 --> 05:58:31,300
i'm still cute yeah i do have my cute and funny moments

4502
05:58:34,820 --> 05:58:36,900
yeah we're gonna get told me

4503
05:58:42,740 --> 05:58:45,060
sorry i'm reading something that i didn't in the context of

4504
05:58:45,060 --> 05:58:47,060
um

4505
05:58:49,700 --> 05:58:55,780
but yeah no i i read a lot about so rgb rgb rgb rgb rgb i um

4506
05:58:57,460 --> 05:59:01,220
i'm right up on a lot of stuff uh you guys also gave me some advice which is actually

4507
05:59:01,220 --> 05:59:06,820
very helpful i did read it even if i didn't respond to you um i always read all the maros even

4508
05:59:06,820 --> 05:59:11,700
if i don't respond um usually because i don't respond because i want to give the same energy

4509
05:59:11,700 --> 05:59:15,620
back or i don't know what to say to be honest although i can yeah sometimes i don't know how to

4510
05:59:16,500 --> 05:59:19,300
talk over text um

4511
05:59:23,540 --> 05:59:29,620
real shibi better than pretend shibi um and i think i think people like it's been like because

4512
05:59:29,620 --> 05:59:35,700
you i totally get it you have these expectations of a streamer because that's how they're marketed um

4513
05:59:36,660 --> 05:59:44,340
and but then you have to realize that they're not going to be able to play the character all the time

4514
05:59:44,340 --> 05:59:51,460
and if they can't impress it but yeah everybody everybody that was hired in my gen they all are

4515
05:59:55,220 --> 05:59:58,660
it's just like so much like their characters in ways you know

4516
05:59:59,540 --> 06:00:01,540
you

4517
06:00:05,140 --> 06:00:09,860
all right no i like i always had respect like i'm i'm not someone who is like uh

4518
06:00:10,580 --> 06:00:16,820
bsm oh like i always had respect for different niches and um

4519
06:00:18,820 --> 06:00:26,020
different uh communities like that like um like sometimes i'll find something silly like pony play

4520
06:00:26,980 --> 06:00:33,460
or like uh leather puppies or whatever the fuck like those are funny um and that's just not my thing

4521
06:00:33,460 --> 06:00:37,380
i'm not gonna go and like outwardly just like go up to someone who i know is into that to be like

4522
06:00:37,380 --> 06:00:43,140
you're fucking stupid like i don't i don't have the energy for that stuff you've been the best

4523
06:00:43,140 --> 06:00:50,260
cap most surprised ever but then like i said the nice surprise you i turn it on i get real

fuckles is that a new emoji i've no thing i've seen a kneeling emoji before

4530
06:01:37,700 --> 06:01:43,060
like for me first yeah the algorithm works in mysterious ways um

4531
06:01:45,060 --> 06:01:46,820
i actually got on my knees help um

4532
06:01:46,900 --> 06:01:47,620
um

4533
06:01:49,220 --> 06:01:58,980
strani said to all of us she wanted us to be ourselves because ourselves were how she saw

4534
06:01:58,980 --> 06:02:06,580
the characters and i couldn't agree with her more and if you disagree with that you're totally

4535
06:02:06,580 --> 06:02:17,220
entitled to that opinion um but i feel like people have really started to appreciate our

4536
06:02:17,220 --> 06:02:23,300
personalities over the last week and it makes me happy like it makes me very happy i'm happy

4537
06:02:24,420 --> 06:02:32,580
that there's somebody for everybody in this company like sometimes you don't like every girl

4538
06:02:32,660 --> 06:02:37,380
or you like one or two but it seems like the consensus is

4539
06:02:40,660 --> 06:02:46,340
like you all like us for our different quirks and our different hobbies and our different

4540
06:02:46,340 --> 06:02:49,300
skills and talents and it just makes me so happy

4541
06:02:52,660 --> 06:02:56,900
and i feel bad because you know people are like oh

4542
06:02:56,900 --> 06:03:00,340
feeler is going to be dead on arrival just because you know the type of content we do on the side

4543
06:03:01,300 --> 06:03:09,780
and i just i'm so excited to see like the next year when we've proved them wrong and we show that

4544
06:03:10,340 --> 06:03:13,460
we're a normal company we just do patreon 18 plus content

4545
06:03:15,620 --> 06:03:18,820
that's it like that's the only difference i'm still a normal streamer

4546
06:03:21,300 --> 06:03:24,660
swimming around about strani's pale she's always been supportive and encouraging as

4547
06:03:24,660 --> 06:03:30,020
content creator yeah like this is the most self-sacrificing woman i've ever met like

4548
06:03:31,700 --> 06:03:36,100
just like what she did for some girls one time she's like collab with me i'm gonna give you the

4549
06:03:36,980 --> 06:03:41,140
the the money for it because you've been screwed because of your past cut like that just

4550
06:03:42,500 --> 06:03:45,380
like why wouldn't i want to work for someone who's like that you know

4551
06:03:47,300 --> 06:03:53,300
why wouldn't i want to work with the other girls who their previous content shows

4552
06:03:55,140 --> 06:03:59,860
positive character their silliness their talents

4553
06:04:02,820 --> 06:04:05,780
i like you guys because you guys are way more mellow than other creators i know delman

4554
06:04:06,580 --> 06:04:10,020
yeah you know what's a bummer is you know as an agency

4555
06:04:11,460 --> 06:04:14,980
vtuber you do have to be a little bit you know more corporate professional

4556
06:04:15,780 --> 06:04:19,620
and i will i'll be like that sometimes i have my moments where i'm like that because i want

4557
06:04:19,780 --> 06:04:29,220
i truly want this company be great i i said to myself have i managed to get into

4558
06:04:29,220 --> 06:04:39,460
velar i will do everything in my power to make it great and succeed because i know if we do

4559
06:04:40,500 --> 06:04:47,060
you will set different precedents for deep vtuber agencies showing that you can still treat your

4560
06:04:48,020 --> 06:04:57,700
talents as human beings you can pay them well you can still make a profit you can invest in the right spots

4561
06:05:00,660 --> 06:05:08,020
um and you can branch out to other platforms safely and you can allow 18 plus content in

4562
06:05:09,060 --> 06:05:15,060
monitor and manage it safely and there's a way like there's a lot of things in place that

4563
06:05:16,020 --> 06:05:22,900
our management team do so that we have peace of mind so that we are have good mental health

4564
06:05:23,860 --> 06:05:29,460
um yeah i want i want it to be a positive for it because a lot of people say we're not going to be

4565
06:05:29,460 --> 06:05:37,220
we're like uh i've seen like even this before i was joined this is before i applied um like watching

4566
06:05:37,220 --> 06:05:42,100
like the drama channels or whatever or people talking about it people are like oh they're

4567
06:05:42,100 --> 06:05:48,260
going to be dead on arrival oh they're sketchy it's a scam it's this that it is it just bums me out

4568
06:05:50,580 --> 06:05:56,740
just because of what happened in strice past you're going to damn the people that are going

4569
06:05:56,740 --> 06:06:04,740
to be in the company in the future um it's a bummer i know we're going to miss out on a lot of

4570
06:06:04,740 --> 06:06:09,700
opportunities before that for because of that but i don't give a shit because i'm going to

4571
06:06:09,700 --> 06:06:14,020
fucking show everybody we're going to be fucking amazing i've been waiting for false to make a video

4572
06:06:14,020 --> 06:06:19,060
and you guys will be probably they're probably not going to and i actually don't mind it because

4573
06:06:19,060 --> 06:06:30,020
we don't give a kind of attention we don't get haters so when we see 18 plus content you will

4574
06:06:30,020 --> 06:06:35,780
never see my flesh in 18 plus content i will say that right now you will never see i'm not going to

4575
06:06:35,780 --> 06:06:42,740
be fucking finger blasting myself my rtx form i will only be doing um patreon like and i'm sorry if

4576
06:06:42,740 --> 06:06:48,020
you were expecting that i'm not going to be doing that i don't feel comfortable doing that um i will be

4577
06:06:48,020 --> 06:06:57,140
doing uh loot audio and that is on my patreon in my description and i will probably be um doing like

4578
06:06:57,140 --> 06:07:06,340
3d stuff like project melody style or uh playing like iregames um i want to learn

4579
06:07:06,820 --> 06:07:11,540
poll so i can do 3d dancing and stuff because that'd be really fucking cool i feel like that'd

4580
06:07:11,540 --> 06:07:18,500
be good like work out yeah i'm already kind of broken

4581
06:07:25,940 --> 06:07:26,580
i'm reading up

4582
06:07:29,300 --> 06:07:32,180
i feel like a lot of people in this news especially if you drop the act because

4583
06:07:32,180 --> 06:07:35,380
like more natural probably because of the company and people back into the fan

4584
06:07:36,180 --> 06:07:42,900
yeah don't knock it till you try it i always say give something jujitsu on stream that'd be funny

4585
06:07:43,460 --> 06:07:45,620
um haven't done jujitsu in a bit though so

4586
06:07:49,220 --> 06:07:54,340
um i forgot what i was gonna say but yeah yeah i can't wait to do hoonipop

4587
06:07:54,340 --> 06:07:59,540
we want to establish ourselves on other platforms first before we kind of branch out um

4588
06:07:59,540 --> 06:08:06,980
starting to explain it into her like exposing vealer thing that she wants us yet to be established

4589
06:08:06,980 --> 06:08:12,740
on the main platforms it's because you know you'll be more successful she knows the algorithm

4590
06:08:12,740 --> 06:08:17,940
she's working the industry for a while and then you'll branch out to other ones once we've been

4591
06:08:17,940 --> 06:08:21,220
you know solidified on youtube and patreon

4592
06:08:21,220 --> 06:08:30,900
i mean like want to see what she has to say

4593
06:08:30,900 --> 06:08:38,580
uh yeah that's on yeah like i feel like when when false first announced and even like kaiyo

4594
06:08:38,580 --> 06:08:46,180
like that other guy um they were covering vealer it was mostly about the negative reaction

4595
06:08:46,180 --> 06:08:52,820
and then like there's like a minute of positive because that's just how news and media works

4596
06:08:52,820 --> 06:08:59,780
you get more clicks and more views when you cover the negative aspects of stuff so it makes sense

4597
06:08:59,780 --> 06:09:11,220
that when you do a report on a company and you really mostly highlight the vocal minority because

4598
06:09:11,220 --> 06:09:16,420
a lot of people were actually pretty positive about vealer when i was like to my own uh lurking

4599
06:09:18,100 --> 06:09:22,500
people are all gonna assume that oh this is actually the majority so it just it really did

4600
06:09:22,500 --> 06:09:25,460
you know it's it's what drives the clicks yeah exactly

4601
06:09:27,540 --> 06:09:30,980
great turn on you feels a lot more personal compared to the best of two that makes us yeah

4602
06:09:30,980 --> 06:09:39,540
like i i love like i didn't think i would love like i'm uh so people wonder about like my history

4603
06:09:39,540 --> 06:09:47,540
with like because i didn't do any sfw stuff on my past life um except my sfw history it was

4604
06:09:48,180 --> 06:09:54,340
i don't only fans for like a month and i was like nah i'm fine i was like i needed like some

4605
06:09:54,340 --> 06:10:07,620
extra cash real quick and then i um drew uh sfw content and i i haven't ever used i hadn't ever

4606
06:10:07,620 --> 06:10:19,300
used a 3d o before um i never recorded super loot content like i would make like jokes and stuff

4607
06:10:19,300 --> 06:10:26,900
from like read silly um scripts from like a mars a smart script haven't like read it or whatever

4608
06:10:27,940 --> 06:10:36,260
but like i realized i actually like making this content and i love voice acting in this way for

4609
06:10:36,260 --> 06:10:46,500
you guys um see yeah it's it's a completely new world for me and i'm realizing i enjoy a lot and

4610
06:10:46,500 --> 06:10:53,700
like don't think oh she was corrupted all this or that no i'm an adult woman no one's coercing me into

4611
06:10:53,700 --> 06:11:00,180
fucking anything relax um con while i've heard of that i've never been there before

4612
06:11:00,180 --> 06:11:08,180
and yeah and it's like i i realized i was good at it the first time i sent a script the like i

4613
06:11:08,180 --> 06:11:14,660
filled something for strani she it was just like did you edit this and i'm like no she's like

4614
06:11:14,660 --> 06:11:20,260
because i sent this to the editor and they were like all i had to do was to add the effects

4615
06:11:22,500 --> 06:11:28,260
and i'm like really she's like fuck yeah that was fucking if she's like if you record like this

4616
06:11:28,260 --> 06:11:31,780
it's everything's gonna be a breeze and she's like you've never done this before and i'm like no

4617
06:11:33,620 --> 06:11:37,140
she's like what the fuck anyways here's some more scripts and so yeah

4618
06:11:38,500 --> 06:11:43,780
and like i'm still learning like i'm still growing as i do voice acting for this stuff

4619
06:11:44,660 --> 06:11:48,820
and i feel like you'll notice as i because she gave us scripts like for month like

4620
06:11:49,540 --> 06:11:54,900
dune audios for this month july audios for this month august audios september audios blah blah blah

4621
06:11:54,980 --> 06:12:01,300
i think you'll notice as i record different months um i do improve and stuff

4622
06:12:03,620 --> 06:12:08,100
and we'll be able to donate super chats as always oh no that's okay that's okay that's a good question

4623
06:12:08,100 --> 06:12:13,620
um we all just applied for monetization so hopefully soon um i know strani is worried about me

4624
06:12:13,620 --> 06:12:23,060
and azura being monetized because of um because of our what we look like with our cake old bitties

4625
06:12:25,220 --> 06:12:31,540
halloween's gonna be hectic yeah it'd be cool what should i be for halloween

4626
06:12:32,740 --> 06:12:39,940
i don't even like it's but also like i also want you guys to know um when strani sent me a lot of strips

4627
06:12:39,940 --> 06:12:47,540
a strips oh uh scripts a lot of the stuff was like office related because my lore is like i work

4628
06:12:47,540 --> 06:12:53,940
to an office so a lot of it's like your boss does this and so she for for a couple of months

4629
06:12:53,940 --> 06:12:58,980
you're not gonna get any like super i'm sorry like and if you can remove yourself from the

4630
06:12:58,980 --> 06:13:02,100
patreon if you want that'll be honest with you you're still gonna enjoy what you hear

4631
06:13:02,980 --> 06:13:08,180
trust me um i've heard some of the girls they for some of mine everybody's fucking good

4632
06:13:08,660 --> 06:13:13,620
um the heart she wants to do a whole like month for like hard dom for me because it seems

4633
06:13:13,620 --> 06:13:19,060
like that's what people want our boss does what your boss catches you doing something that's all i'm

4634
06:13:19,060 --> 06:13:24,820
gonna say um yeah my next audio she she's staggering out the audio so you guys technically

4635
06:13:24,820 --> 06:13:30,980
get an audio every day if you're subscribed to all of us which is pretty fucking awesome my opinion

4636
06:13:30,980 --> 06:13:40,260
so you never like you just be mindless for a week um but yeah it knows i like i feel like i'm a

4637
06:13:40,260 --> 06:13:46,420
there are some where i'm like heart like but it's always in the a lot of it is in the environment

4638
06:13:46,420 --> 06:13:51,620
of an office that's what i mean it's not like there's not a lot in the environment of like a fucking

4639
06:13:51,620 --> 06:14:02,340
sex engine that's like which is what people are expecting big brain scheduling again can't just

4640
06:14:02,340 --> 06:14:11,380
be that yeah essentially pretty much um so yeah i feel like because but like there's also cool stuff

4641
06:14:11,380 --> 06:14:18,660
like i don't i don't really think i'm it's a it's bad thing to spoil it and she never said we couldn't

4642
06:14:18,660 --> 06:14:24,500
like talk about the scripts you felt but like i'm also like your roommate in one of them i'm also

4643
06:14:24,500 --> 06:14:33,220
your um classmate i'm also like someone you just match with until like it's so it's a lot of cool

4644
06:14:33,220 --> 06:14:40,820
different scenarios um i'm dom and generally the majority of them um literally of course the

4645
06:14:40,820 --> 06:14:48,580
first one you guys vote to listen to was my literally my one sub audio i recorded out of

4646
06:14:49,860 --> 06:14:59,460
like 27 well i don't think it was that much but it was just funny uh and first yeah

4647
06:15:02,980 --> 06:15:09,700
i know and then i was just like and so it tied with uh with a different one that was me dom

4648
06:15:09,780 --> 06:15:13,620
and i'm like strani please pick the one that's dom or they're gonna be like what the fuck is this

4649
06:15:13,620 --> 06:15:17,700
this is not what we signed up for she's like oh i already uploaded the other one and i'm like god damn it

4650
06:15:21,540 --> 06:15:27,380
any of them considers rich uh i don't really know you guys will have to tell me to be honest

4651
06:15:27,380 --> 06:15:30,500
or like um tell strani cuz strani is the one who puts the tags in

4652
06:15:31,300 --> 06:15:40,900
yeah i know i'd not like even when i before i read the script like i read the title i was like oh

4653
06:15:40,900 --> 06:15:47,540
this is what's gonna happen i'm like that's not what happened like it was it's i love reading the

4654
06:15:47,540 --> 06:15:54,340
scripts before i like um read them out you're like record them because then i just get like really

4655
06:15:54,340 --> 06:16:05,220
surprised and i'm like oh man oh whoa oh gosh um but yeah so like this like we're all gonna be

4656
06:16:05,220 --> 06:16:18,420
doing a variety of content and roles situation it's really fun um i also like i want to do

4657
06:16:18,420 --> 06:16:22,980
cuz i really like asmr role plays like i like just reading scripts and doing like guided

4658
06:16:22,980 --> 06:16:28,740
meditations and like sleep aids and stuff so i'm gonna have a lot of that on my channel um just

4659
06:16:28,740 --> 06:16:37,540
like safer work stuff i think strani is having someone edit my um one of my safer work audios

4660
06:16:39,380 --> 06:16:43,380
and we're waiting for monetization for her to and then she's gonna put it it's like a

4661
06:16:44,020 --> 06:16:47,460
i'm so excited for it i worked really hard on it so i hope it comes out good

4662
06:16:47,620 --> 06:16:56,020
um yeah like uh i think guided meditation would be really cool

4663
06:17:01,300 --> 06:17:03,860
you read watershed down in fifth grade yes i did

4664
06:17:06,820 --> 06:17:12,100
cuz i was weird and i like warrior cats and watershed down is actually very similar to warrior

4665
06:17:12,100 --> 06:17:17,060
cats i'm entire playlist asmr so you know how i've been watching lately and this is

4666
06:17:17,060 --> 06:17:23,460
they're one of my favorite um asmr this lately i don't know if you guys know who king hobbit is

4667
06:17:23,460 --> 06:17:31,940
but she's the cutest uh girl i think she's from the uk and um and it's like she's just like

4668
06:17:31,940 --> 06:17:38,340
so fucking goofy and she's all over the place and she has the cutest like accent uh i highly

4669
06:17:38,340 --> 06:17:44,980
recommend you watching king hobbit she's so adorable i definitely wish i could make content

4670
06:17:44,980 --> 06:17:51,300
like i want to learn how to make like um content or i can kind of like smack my head

4671
06:17:51,300 --> 06:17:59,300
on over my rtx face and do like visual triggers you know like i'm like wave my hands in your face

4672
06:17:59,300 --> 06:18:03,940
and shit because i feel like like the lag with a 3d model oh you know or maybe i could try

4673
06:18:03,940 --> 06:18:10,100
with 3d model um i know there's some vtubers that do that but if i could like motion track

4674
06:18:10,180 --> 06:18:17,140
my models head over my body i think that would be and do like visual triggers i think that'd be

4675
06:18:17,140 --> 06:18:24,020
really fun yeah exactly like how onigiri does it with her cooking like i would love to do that with

4676
06:18:24,660 --> 06:18:29,620
asmr and i've seen like there was one creator i saw that actually was doing it for like music

4677
06:18:29,620 --> 06:18:35,300
related stuff i think he was like playing a ukulele he's like a really goofy looking um really cool

4678
06:18:35,300 --> 06:18:41,860
stylized um almost looks like something from like cyberspace what was that gay what was that tv show

4679
06:18:42,500 --> 06:18:49,060
cyber kids i don't know looks like something out of that and i was like oh that'd be sick to apply

4680
06:18:49,060 --> 06:18:55,220
to asmr and there's also somebody who did that something similar before that um tv ties you

4681
06:18:55,220 --> 06:19:02,100

and i feel like it would be easier for monetization because um you like

4688
06:19:43,860 --> 06:19:50,260
like when a human if a human gets to review a video um they would see that no i'm not doing

4689
06:19:50,260 --> 06:19:56,180
something inappropriate i'm just like doing a trigger and with like because a lot of times um

06:26:11,700 --> 06:26:15,940
hard and i had to use another laptop i don't know if i'll have that laptop much much longer

4749
06:26:15,940 --> 06:26:21,540
because it's a company laptop and if i leave this company they're gonna yoink it for me maybe i don't

4750
06:26:21,540 --> 06:26:32,740

4752
06:26:40,260 --> 06:26:44,900
from when i worked from home the boxes to return died nice how am i gonna let me out

4753

4754
06:26:52,980 --> 06:26:56,660
and i'm like please don't ask from the back because i can sell that display or i can use it

4755
06:26:57,540 --> 06:27:08,340
yeah i definitely choked on a kinder egg when i was a kid

4756
06:27:09,380 --> 06:27:12,820
did i or was it something else i don't know i put a lot of stuff in my mouth as a kid

4757
06:27:13,860 --> 06:27:17,220
that sounded so fucked up i meant like toys i like to chew on things

4758
06:27:17,540 --> 06:27:26,340
but xlossin should be not true no but the thing is like they um

4759
06:27:28,340 --> 06:27:36,340
they remote manage it so well the the the display i could probably keep but the the

4760
06:27:36,340 --> 06:27:37,460
laptop they remote manage

4761
06:27:41,060 --> 06:27:45,780
i remember i swallowed a quarter when i was a kid and i had to poop it out

4762
06:27:47,300 --> 06:27:48,900
or it might still be in my system i don't know

4763
06:27:53,380 --> 06:27:56,900
i literally just remembered that right now holy shit that i swallowed a quarter

4764
06:27:56,900 --> 06:28:01,140
my mom was so frustrated with me i have to ask my mom about that i was like oh yeah

4765
06:28:01,140 --> 06:28:03,380
i didn't swallow it what the fuck i did swallow weird stuff

4766
06:28:07,540 --> 06:28:09,860
what what the cookie put what the fuck is that

4767
06:28:10,500 --> 06:28:17,540

06:28:19,140 --> 06:28:26,100
it's been seven hours holy shit bro hi well a bunch of us is gonna get chopped i'm probably gonna

4770
06:28:33,700 --> 06:28:52,340

4771
06:28:52,340 --> 06:29:01,460
microphone lady um and i'll probably keep in when i got my food and when

4772
06:29:03,700 --> 06:29:15,540

4773
06:29:15,540 --> 06:29:22,980

4774
06:29:22,980 --> 06:29:25,700

4775
06:29:31,060 --> 06:29:35,860
yeah i'm gonna when i went on brb i'm gonna cut out when i came back

4777
06:29:42,740 --> 06:29:49,140
i realized it takes a long time for youtube to process stuff like so i'm i'm probably

06:32:25,620 --> 06:32:32,420
bodies feel okay my arm kind of hurts i've had like maybe like one migraine i'm actually doing okay

4804
06:32:32,420 --> 06:32:37,220
i think because i'm happy that i'm streaming again it was hard being away from streaming for so long

4805
06:32:39,540 --> 06:32:40,980
i was only like dying

4806
06:32:43,140 --> 06:32:48,500
yeah and like i'm a little stressed because like my fucking you know my dad and now my

4807
06:32:48,580 --> 06:32:53,060
my landlord and all that but you know i just i have faith that everything will be okay

4808
06:32:54,980 --> 06:33:01,940
we're together we're good i got you guys i got my girls i got my management team

4809
06:33:04,980 --> 06:33:11,380
i got my parents i got my therapist i got my friends i will be a okay and that's what i

4810
06:33:11,380 --> 06:33:12,500
always have to remind myself

4811
06:33:17,780 --> 06:33:24,340
sometimes i tend to be like kind of a doomer and just like really get really down and

4812
06:33:25,220 --> 06:33:30,260
i've been trying to practice on not doing that then it only just makes me have a flare-up

4813
06:33:30,260 --> 06:33:34,420
and i'm just like can't fucking move yeah

4814
06:33:34,660 --> 06:33:36,660
yeah

4815
06:33:40,660 --> 06:33:50,500
and my dad has um diabetes genetic though not like um health like diet related i forget is it

4816
06:33:50,500 --> 06:33:54,580
like i was gonna type one and type two confused but it doesn't even matter because he actually

4817
06:33:54,580 --> 06:34:01,460
technically has both he has like that weird rare one where it's like the he needs he can manage it

4818
06:34:01,460 --> 06:34:07,700
with his diet but he like he still has an insulin pump um i will actually which really sucks i'll

4819
06:34:07,700 --> 06:34:12,100
probably end up being diabetic too because genetically um all the women in my family have it

4820
06:34:13,540 --> 06:34:22,020
so i'm more like so i try to eat right um i try to you know stay on top of my a1c

4821
06:34:24,020 --> 06:34:28,100
i know there's like another a couple of other v2 births that have diabetes

4822
06:34:28,820 --> 06:34:38,100
and like i'm my dad has educated me a lot on stuff and i'm not like scared of needles or

4823
06:34:38,100 --> 06:34:43,220
anything if i had to do that so yeah i'm very like my my dad's like very hard on me because he

4824
06:34:43,220 --> 06:34:48,500
doesn't want me to get it but it's very much a possibility all of my other members my dad's

4825
06:34:48,580 --> 06:34:50,740
side have gotten it like literally before the age of 35

4826
06:34:54,820 --> 06:34:56,660
and i'm 56 so you never know

4855
06:38:22,660 --> 06:38:28,580
she has like a little bit this is me analyzing her voice patterns not like insulting or anything

4856

I'm eating fuck.

4899
06:43:24,740 --> 06:43:26,740
I got it earlier.

4900
06:43:26,740 --> 06:43:30,740
I just flipped my spoon and it was really cool.

4901
06:43:30,740 --> 06:43:32,740
I don't know.

4902
06:43:32,740 --> 06:43:34,740
I just don't feel like...

4903
06:43:34,740 --> 06:43:36,740
I need to learn more.

4904
06:43:36,740 --> 06:43:38,740
I just listen and I mimic.

4905
06:43:38,740 --> 06:43:40,740
That's all I do.

4906
06:43:40,740 --> 06:43:42,740
I'm not trained or whatever.

4907
06:43:46,740 --> 06:43:48,740
My model looks so funny when I eat.

4908
06:43:48,740 --> 06:43:50,740
I'm really having...

4909
06:43:50,740 --> 06:43:52,740
I'm really having a bad time.

4910
06:43:52,740 --> 06:43:54,740
I'm having a bad time.

4911
06:43:54,740 --> 06:43:56,740
I'm having a bad time.

4912
06:43:56,740 --> 06:43:58,740
I'm having a bad time.

4913
06:43:58,740 --> 06:44:00,740
I'm having a really bad fucking cramps.

4914
06:44:04,740 --> 06:44:06,740
I think it's my tummy though.

4915
06:44:14,740 --> 06:44:16,740
I don't even know how I would train.

4916
06:44:16,740 --> 06:44:18,740
How the fuck? It's cold.

4917
06:44:18,740 --> 06:44:20,740
But it's okay.

4918
06:44:24,740 --> 06:44:26,740
Do I have to fart real bad or something?

4919
06:44:26,740 --> 06:44:28,740
What the fuck is wrong with me?

4920
06:44:34,740 --> 06:44:36,740
I never try to do Amelie's voice.

4921
06:44:38,740 --> 06:44:40,740
I'm actually better at doing higher voices

4922
06:44:40,740 --> 06:44:42,740
than I am voices that are similar

4923
06:44:42,740 --> 06:44:45,740
and like deep like a mature as mine.

4924
06:44:45,740 --> 06:44:46,740
I don't know.

4925
06:44:46,740 --> 06:44:48,740
I only have a bunch of a mommy voice.

4926
06:44:48,740 --> 06:44:50,740
Naturally.

4927
06:44:52,740 --> 06:44:54,740
I do put on my mommy voice just a little bit.

4928
06:44:56,740 --> 06:44:58,740
I don't know what I would do with it.

4929
06:45:02,740 --> 06:45:04,740
Go to bed!

4930
06:45:04,740 --> 06:45:06,740

Like none of my singing stuff will be a professional.

4965

4967

4969
06:47:11,020 --> 06:47:13,320
I swear to fucking god this will give me food poisoning.

4970

4971
06:47:17,520 --> 06:47:18,520
Um...

4972
06:47:20,020 --> 06:47:22,020

4973
06:47:23,020 --> 06:47:24,020
Um...

4974
06:47:25,720 --> 06:47:27,520

4975
06:47:27,520 --> 06:47:29,520

I'm in mume's range?

4977
06:47:36,820 --> 06:47:40,720
I'll be honest, I don't watch a lot of holo girls because...

4978
06:47:42,620 --> 06:47:45,220
They scare me cause they're so talented.

4979
06:47:47,020 --> 06:47:49,020
Rap god, she be.

4980
06:47:51,020 --> 06:47:58,020
I have done rap god and oh my god I'm not gonna eat the rest of this fuck cause my stomach is fucking killing me now.

4981
06:47:58,020 --> 06:47:59,020
Um...

4982
06:48:01,020 --> 06:48:02,020
Who do I watch?

4983
06:48:02,020 --> 06:48:03,520
I only watch small corpos.

4984
06:48:07,020 --> 06:48:08,520
And I watch indies.

4985
06:48:10,020 --> 06:48:13,020
And I watch my friends from appeal.

4986
06:48:14,020 --> 06:48:16,020
Maybe I need to fart holo.

4987
06:48:17,120 --> 06:48:18,120
I'm not sure I can say this.

4988
06:48:22,020 --> 06:48:23,520
That did not help.

4989
06:48:26,020 --> 06:48:28,020

4990
06:48:29,020 --> 06:48:33,020

4991
06:48:33,020 --> 06:48:34,520

Why are you clawing at my chair?

4994
06:48:38,520 --> 06:48:41,520
Sometimes she's lazy, sometimes she takes off and helps.

4995
06:48:41,520 --> 06:48:43,520
Because she's jumping into my lap.

06:48:43,520 --> 06:48:44,520
I hope you've had a good stream.
