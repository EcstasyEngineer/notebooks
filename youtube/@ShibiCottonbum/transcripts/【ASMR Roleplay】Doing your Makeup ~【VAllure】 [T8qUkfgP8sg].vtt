00:00.000 --> 00:26.000
Hi, I don't know if you can hear me.

00:26.000 --> 00:52.000
I don't know if this sounds okay, I'm a bit low.

00:52.000 --> 01:08.000
Hello.

01:08.000 --> 01:36.000
You can hear my EC, it's quite loud, but do you like the white noise or is it bothersome?

01:36.000 --> 01:52.000
I will keep today, thank you.

01:52.000 --> 02:18.000
Hello.

02:18.000 --> 02:46.000
I am trying to add to the effects.

02:46.000 --> 03:08.000
Okay, wait, do I sound okay too?

03:08.000 --> 03:22.000
I think I look nice.

03:22.000 --> 03:32.000
Okay, I just want to make sure.

03:32.000 --> 03:54.000
I'm very excited, I have on my desk so much stuff.

03:54.000 --> 04:16.000
You can call me big sis.

04:16.000 --> 04:30.000
Pretend you can't see my ball gang under my neck.

04:30.000 --> 04:52.000
No, no, I'm just myself today, I'm just wearing a different outfit.

04:52.000 --> 05:00.000
Hello, you guys like the new emote?

05:00.000 --> 05:06.000
Let me see if I can fix that real quick.

05:06.000 --> 05:22.000
You might hear some water in the background, that's my cat's water fountain.

05:36.000 --> 05:44.000
Hold on, I'm taking off my, taking off my, my cat, the clown is your favorite emote.

05:44.000 --> 06:00.000
I'm very licensed, I'm a licensed esthetician.

06:14.000 --> 06:30.000
What the heck?

06:30.000 --> 06:36.000
There we go.

06:36.000 --> 06:46.000
That's better at least.

06:46.000 --> 06:58.000
Yeah, the really intense crying one is one of my favorite past PL emotes and so I had to bring it back.

06:58.000 --> 07:04.000
One of my done doing my makeup, you've only one makeup twice in your life.

07:04.000 --> 07:10.000
Well, I love makeup, I love it a lot actually.

07:10.000 --> 07:18.000
I don't really wear makeup that much anymore because I don't leave my house, but today I'm going to be doing your makeup.

07:18.000 --> 07:24.000
I'm going to be giving you some personal attention before I go.

07:24.000 --> 07:30.000
I hope you enjoy it, since I leave tomorrow for my trip to see my family.

07:30.000 --> 07:37.000
I'll be gone until the 23rd and I'll miss you guys a lot, so I thought I'd be nice today.

07:37.000 --> 07:50.000
And I kind of walk you through like a skincare routine and then I'll brush your hair and do your makeup, give you a little ear massage.

07:50.000 --> 07:54.000
Oh yeah, do you ever do your makeup just to sit around the house?

07:54.000 --> 08:00.000
Yeah, I literally put on like a full face today to get my nails done when I really didn't need to.

08:00.000 --> 08:07.000
I did light blue for my nails and I kept them a shorter length, I didn't do them super long.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
So they're nice, they're cute little almond nails.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
A little picture from after stream.

08:13.000 --> 08:20.000
Yeah, I'll miss you guys.

08:20.000 --> 08:29.000
This includes, yeah, yeah, I'm going to do your hair, I'm going to wash your hair, I'm going to brush it.

08:29.000 --> 08:34.000
You're going to do a lot of triggers today.

08:34.000 --> 08:44.000
Yeah, I hope you guys enjoy, I hope my AC and my background noise like my cat eating right now is a bit too distracting.

08:44.000 --> 08:51.000
I'm very nervous for tomorrow because I fly out, my mom's bringing me to the airport.

08:51.000 --> 09:00.000
I'm very anxious because I haven't flown in a very, very long time and I don't like traveling by myself.

09:00.000 --> 09:06.000
So of course I'll remember you, you'll be all that I'm thinking about when I'm gone.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
It's going to be so hard.

09:09.000 --> 09:23.000
But when I come back, I have a special, special, sorry that was boomy, a special Twitter space I want to do on my alt for you guys.

09:23.000 --> 09:29.000
I had the idea and I was going to do it today but I'm like nah, I'll do it when I come back.

09:29.000 --> 09:46.000
Another thing, I want to apologize in advance because I never recorded the ASMR video that I was supposed to and so it's definitely not going to be edited in time for my absence.

09:46.000 --> 09:52.000
But I do have some shorts coming so I hope you guys like the shorts.

09:52.000 --> 09:58.000
Yeah, and I'll probably do a Twitter space while I'm there and talk to you guys.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
I'll be active on social media.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Yeah.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
Well, I miss you guys a lot.

10:07.000 --> 10:13.000
Yeah, I'm going to be really sad without the kitties.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
What?

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
What is that, Emote?

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
What is that?

10:20.000 --> 10:27.000
Oh wait, that's the, it looks really weird reflected on YouTube.

10:27.000 --> 10:35.000
The little pen lights look really fucking goofy.

10:35.000 --> 10:40.000
Some of these translate very weirdly on YouTube but it's fine.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
Let me tweet that I'm live.

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
You don't see anything in my hand.

10:47.000 --> 10:52.000
There's nothing there.

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
Okay, let me just...

10:56.000 --> 11:06.000
Um, Boomi is running in circles around the couch. She seems to be having a good time.

11:06.000 --> 11:12.000
Oh, we hit 11k followers on Twitter! Let's go!

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
That's awesome. That's so cool.

11:14.000 --> 11:22.000
And we're so close to 10k, guys. I'll probably be 10k in the middle of my trip.

11:22.000 --> 11:29.000
Give me some ideas for 10k.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Um, you say...

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
Oops, I can't type.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
Ow, my nose!

11:37.000 --> 11:44.000
Okay.

11:44.000 --> 11:58.000
Maybe tweet this on my own.

11:58.000 --> 12:15.600
Maybe Endurance or Donut request ASMR stream?

12:15.600 --> 12:16.600
Maybe.

12:16.600 --> 12:17.600
That's good.

12:17.600 --> 12:26.600
Evil witch ASMR roleplaying for the time being.

12:26.600 --> 12:35.120
Yeah I think I honestly have to credit um the clipper who clipped us cause that video

12:35.120 --> 12:42.520
of like the adult youtuber agency that has almost 100k views and youtube has called us

12:42.520 --> 12:48.480
um a few times so I might be called again but um it's just really incredible how just

12:48.480 --> 12:53.760
like a clipper channel that just takes interest in you can really support the growth and I'm

12:53.760 --> 13:03.320
very thankful for that um he discovered me via that video yeah I love reading the comments

13:03.320 --> 13:07.720
on that video and people are really funny people think Azera is faking her voice which

13:07.720 --> 13:13.000
is I think is my favorite cause that's just how she actually talks she doesn't point

13:13.000 --> 13:16.240
on a voice or anything.

13:16.240 --> 13:23.000
I don't know why youtube keeps calling us um again the AI thinks that it's not appropriate

13:23.000 --> 13:32.760
growth it thinks that it's not real so it is what it is um I don't know why I'm so anxious

13:32.760 --> 13:34.080
I'm feeling very shy.

13:34.080 --> 13:46.720
Well me can you please stop I don't know if you guys heard that.

13:46.720 --> 13:50.800
I hope I won't have to congratulate you we might actually I won't be surprised if I

13:50.800 --> 14:01.920
dip below 10k and then get back up to it and she's very excitable right now.

50:27.800 --> 50:32.840
okay now that I brushed your hair out I'm just gonna let your hair air dry um

50:33.720 --> 50:36.920
I think I don't want to like use my hair dryer on you it'll be too loud

50:42.920 --> 50:43.880
so now that

50:46.520 --> 50:53.000
we did your hair we brushed it out it looks nice it looks so nice down really really good um

50:54.120 --> 50:56.200
now I'm gonna do your skincare okay

50:57.080 --> 51:09.080
so um I'm gonna go and already washed your face so I'm going to use a chemical exfoliant

51:10.680 --> 51:13.880
this is what I watched on on on YouTube

51:15.960 --> 51:19.880
so don't worry a chemical exfoliant isn't bad it's fine

51:20.840 --> 51:27.560
so you have a very unique um balance on your face and so you want to balance your AHA

51:28.200 --> 51:36.360
and your um BHA on your face um it's better to use a chemical exfoliant than a physical

51:36.360 --> 51:42.680
exfoliant because physical exfoliant can make micro tears in your skin and the micro tears in

51:42.680 --> 51:50.280
your skin can cause acne and cause your skin to be very sensitive um so I'm using uh Paula's Choice

51:51.560 --> 51:55.880
exfoliant on your face it's not gonna burn

51:59.080 --> 52:07.880
I'm just gonna put some on this cotton pad

52:13.640 --> 52:16.680
okay I don't have a lot of product left in us

52:21.320 --> 52:26.760
it's fine I watched it on YouTube it's what the beauty guru told me to do

52:32.040 --> 52:37.400
no I know you normally use soap and water but sometimes just soap and water can dry out your

52:37.480 --> 52:42.680
skin and you want to make sure you're fully at your skin otherwise you're gonna get black heads

52:42.680 --> 52:51.240
and white heads and acne and I'm trying to help you okay it's also good for discoloration

52:53.320 --> 52:59.000
so let me wipe your face close your close your eyes close your eyes

52:59.160 --> 53:01.400
good goodennnina

53:02.040 --> 53:12.120

Good, good, good, good, good.

53:27.920 --> 53:29.920
Well, now, keep your head straight.

53:38.920 --> 53:39.920
Don't open your eyes.

53:39.920 --> 53:42.920
Do you want me to poke you in the eye? It'll burn if it goes in your eye.

53:48.920 --> 53:58.920
You can't peek. I'm not peeking.

54:06.920 --> 54:08.920
This is what happens. You have to hold your head straight.

54:19.920 --> 54:20.920
You're doing a good job.

54:23.920 --> 54:30.920
So I'm using a cotton pad and I'm just wiping this along your face.

54:49.920 --> 54:56.920
Cotton pad or cousins also? I think we do have a cousin in cotton pad.

55:04.920 --> 55:09.920
Don't turn your head. Stay still. I need to get a spark by your nose.

55:09.920 --> 55:20.920
See, it doesn't have any on eyes to be peppered.

55:27.920 --> 55:29.920
Please do not sneeze in my face.

55:29.920 --> 55:39.920
Hold on. Is that cotton on your face?

55:59.920 --> 56:11.920
Okay, I think it's good.

56:11.920 --> 56:21.920
So now that I put the chemical exfoliant, I don't want to put on a serum that's another type of exfoliant.

56:21.920 --> 56:24.920
I'm not going to do lack of the gas or anything.

56:24.920 --> 56:29.920
So I'm just going to go in with just a caudally serum.

56:32.920 --> 56:34.920
It's a Xenome Perfection.

56:52.920 --> 56:56.920
It smells good. I'm going to put it a little bit more.

57:07.920 --> 57:11.920
Okay, I'm going to tap this on your face.

57:11.920 --> 57:13.920
It smells like flowers.

57:13.920 --> 57:24.920
You want to pat it and you don't want to rub in the serum. You always want to pat your serum.

57:43.920 --> 57:45.920
Okay.

58:04.920 --> 58:06.920
Nice.

58:06.920 --> 58:21.920
Now that I've got a serum on your face, I'm going to put on a...

58:21.920 --> 58:25.920
Let's see, what is this called?

58:25.920 --> 58:33.920
I'm going to put some sunscreen on you because no matter what skin tone you are, sun is very powerful.

58:33.920 --> 58:37.920
You want to avoid skin damage.

58:41.920 --> 58:44.920
Let's shake it up.

58:44.920 --> 58:49.920
This is Innisfree sunscreen.

58:49.920 --> 58:51.920
That's beautiful.

58:51.920 --> 58:54.920
It smells like flowers.

59:03.920 --> 59:12.920
I'm going to dab it onto my hand.

59:12.920 --> 59:14.920
Okay.

59:28.920 --> 59:30.920
I'm going to rub this into your skin.

59:30.920 --> 59:38.920
You always want to make sure that your skincare dries down before you go on to the next thing.

59:42.920 --> 59:44.920
Okay.

59:56.920 --> 59:58.920
Get some more.

01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:14.920
Okay.

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:25.920
You want it?

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:28.920
The trick is with sunscreen, hold out your...

01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:30.920
Yeah, give me your hand.

01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:32.920
Give me your hand.

01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:34.920
I'm not going to bite your hand.

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:41.920
So what you want to do is you want to hold out your first two fingers, so your index finger and your middle finger.

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:48.920
And then the amount of sunscreen you want has to be aligned on both fingers.

01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:50.920
And then you can...

01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:53.920
You want to incorporate that all in.

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:58.920
Even if you're dark skinned, you need sunscreen.

01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:03.920
You can still get skin cancer, even if you're brown.

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:07.920
You can still get sunburn, even if you're brown.

01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:18.920
Okay.

01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:21.920
I think I put too much on my hands, but your face is fine.

01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:23.920
Let me go wash my hands.

01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:35.920
Okay.

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:54.920
Why are you still here? I thought you were going to run away.

01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:56.920
That's right, I locked the door.

01:01:56.920 --> 01:02:00.920
Um, as dark skin this is cat.

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:13.920
They don't know that I'm also brown.

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:16.920
They don't know that I'm brown.

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:19.920
Um, anyways.

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:27.920
So the next thing I'm going to do is I'm just going to put on some lotion on your lips.

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:33.920
That's not the lotion.

01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:36.920
That's the lotion.

01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:41.920
Did you take the lotion?

01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:44.920
Give it, give it back.

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:46.920
Sheesh.

01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:58.920
You want to use a non-fragment lotion, just something basic, like CeraVe.

01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:01.920
CeraVe is really good.

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:16.920
Because sometimes the fragrance can irritate your skin.

01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:26.920
Make sure that when you select a, um, what's it called?

01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:28.920
A lotion.

01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:32.920
You don't want it to have like the first thing, sometimes it's alcohol.

01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:39.920
And the ingredient list, you don't want it to be alcohol.

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:49.920
If you're, if you're very acne prone, I recommend doing a spot treatment of Penoxel.

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:52.920
Um, that's the brand name.

01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:56.920
But it's good. You don't want to put it all over your face because it can dry out your skin.

01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:59.920
But you can just dab it on.

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:29.920
I don't have my normal lotion, so I'm just putting on bath and body on you though.

01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:33.920
Normally I wouldn't put this on my face, I'll just put it on my body.

01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:39.920
Because your face skin is very sensitive.

01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:42.920
It smells very good though.

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:45.920
It's a thousand wishes.

01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:55.920
It's a thousand wishes.

01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:25.920
It's a thousand wishes.

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:28.920
It's a thousand wishes.

01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:31.920
It's a thousand wishes.

01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:34.920
It's a thousand wishes.

01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:37.920
It's a thousand wishes.

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:40.920
It's a thousand wishes.

01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:43.920
It's a thousand wishes.

01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:47.920
It's a thousand wishes.

01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:51.920
Okay.

01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:59.920
Kiddyl, you look like you're really up and sleepy.

01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:03.920
Do you like putting lotion on your face?

01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:05.920
That's funny.

01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:24.920
Are you falling asleep?

01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:34.920
I am falling asleep wake up.

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:44.920
Are you falling asleep?

01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:47.920
I am falling asleep wake up.

01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:49.920
Wake up.

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:57.920
Nightmare, nightmare, nightmare.

01:06:57.920 --> 01:07:03.920
I can't get more of the lotion.

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:11.920
I know about the different content.

01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:15.920
You never want to put any sort of oil on your face

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:17.920
because I can clog your pores.

01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:20.920
Coins I have to put.

01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:22.920
I've got a serum.

01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:29.920
I need to put a serum that helps with your pores.

01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:32.920
It's called Nekamad.

01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:34.920
Nekamad.

01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:38.920
Go away, go away.

01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:41.920
Go away, go away.

01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:43.920
Go away.

01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:46.920
Go away.

01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:59.920
I want to use my headscarf with a free bottle.

01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:02.920
You know we have four layers of product on right now.

01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:06.920
You just have a toner, which is the Paula's Choice.

01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:11.920
You have a serum, you have sunscreen, and now you have lotion.

01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:13.920
Go away.

01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:15.920
Go away.

01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:17.920
Go away.

01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:19.920
Go away.

01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:21.920
Go away.

01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:24.920
Go away.

01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:50.920
I'm almost done rubbing it in.

01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:52.920
Just a little bit longer.

01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:13.920
Go away.

01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:30.920
I'm going to use this to rub it in.

01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:38.920
It's so watery.

01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:43.920
Let me wipe my hands off.

01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:55.920
Okay.

01:09:57.920 --> 01:09:59.920
Brush.

01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:06.920
This is more than it.

01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:15.920
Yeah, yeah, I love you too.

01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:24.920
I just want to say thank you for helping me out with this so far.

01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:26.920
Your skin is looking really nice.

01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:29.920
You look like you're going.

01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:57.920
Okay, we think you need the makeup, but that's too bad because I still want to practice.

01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:09.920
Okay, so now that we did your skin care, I'm going to do your makeup.

01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:13.920
So first, when you do your makeup, you want to start with the primer.

01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:20.920
I'm going to use the NYX primer.

01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:22.920
No, is it Elf or NYX?

01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:25.920
Sorry, it's the Elf Supergrip primer.

01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:27.920
It's the blue one.

01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:33.920
It's really good at holding your makeup in place.

01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:35.920
At least that's what the YouTube videos have.

01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:41.920
Okay, so now I'm going to do your skin care.

01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:43.920
Okay, so now I'm going to do your skin care.

01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:45.920
Okay, so now I'm going to do your skin care.

01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:47.920
Okay, so now I'm going to do your skin care.

01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:49.920
Okay, so now I'm going to do your skin care.

01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:51.920
Okay, so now I'm going to do your skin care.

01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:53.920
Okay, so now I'm going to do your skin care.

01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:55.920
Okay, so now I'm going to do your skin care.

01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:57.920
Okay, so now I'm going to do your skin care.

01:11:57.920 --> 01:11:59.920
Okay, so now I'm going to do your skin care.

01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:01.920
Okay, so now I'm going to do your skin care.

01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:03.920
Okay, so now I'm going to do your skin care.

01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:05.920
Okay, so now I'm going to do your skin care.

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:11.920
okay, let me put this.

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:25.920
oops, so sorry.

01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:31.920
I'm gonna cut a little Tine, just like that.

01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:33.920
just going to rub this into your skin,

01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:37.920
into your skin. I'm just gonna kind of like pat it.

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:48.920
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. It's okay. It's okay. Don't cry. Please don't cry.

01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:57.920
Okay. It's okay. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Yeah, I'll take you for ice cream.

01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:08.920
I can't. Come on. I'm kissing your ear better.

01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:15.920
Stop crying. Yeah, I'll take you for ice cream. Please don't cry. I'll take you for ice cream.

01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:25.920
Yeah, you can have whatever flavor you want.

01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:40.920
Okay, a bottle.

01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:46.920
I'm gonna wipe my hands off.

01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:53.920
Now that we have your skin primed, I'm gonna go in with the foundation.

01:13:53.920 --> 01:14:09.920
Normally, I use new personally. I use S.T.A. water, but for you, I'm not gonna use a $50 foundation.

01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:19.920
So I'm gonna just use the Maybelline Fit Me foundation. I can get like, you know what I'm saying?

01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:28.920
And it is matte, porous, and it lasts 12 hours.

01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:42.920
I got your skin tone. So it should be a good match.

01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:54.920
Yeah, makeup's really expensive. You have no idea how much I spend on makeup.

01:14:55.920 --> 01:15:03.920
That's why I haven't been wearing it as often. That's why I've been trying to shop for more drugstore brands.

01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:09.920
Because usually, there's an expression in the beauty community called a dupe.

01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:15.920
So the dupe is usually has like the same formula, but it's not like the super big name brand.

01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:20.920
But they're very similar. They might be like one or two key differences.

01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:25.920
But otherwise, they're essentially the same.

01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:33.920
That's a good question. Why am I painting your face the same tone it already is?

01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:39.920
So this is gonna even out your skin tone, because not everybody has flawless glass skin.

01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:53.920
And if you wanted to like, cover up any deeper pores or any acne scars or anything, that would be good.

01:15:53.920 --> 01:16:03.920
Sometimes people will use a concealer first if they have like, it's called under-concealing or under-painting.

01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:11.920
So they will conceal the spots first and then they'll go over with a foundation.

01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:18.920
I prefer to do foundation and concealer mostly because I don't really have a lot of spots to cover.

01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:26.920
I'll just do concealer under my eyes, because sometimes I like dark circles because the concealer doesn't sleep well.

01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:30.920
On the left, get this.

01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:41.920
Like priming a wall before painting is a good question.

01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:45.920
You don't want a little bit of concealer though. You don't want a lot of concealer.

01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:48.920
I'm gonna go into the concealer first.

01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:51.920
I'll look concealer under your eyes.

01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:01.920
Why would you spend so much on makeup?

01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:04.920
Okay, mom's spending a lot of time on makeup.

01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:07.920
Okay, I won't tell mom this and that.

01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:09.920
I think, I don't know.

01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:15.920
There is like a, sometimes a definite difference in like, more expensive makeup.

01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:20.920
I only really get the more expensive stuff for like, certain things.

01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:25.920
So like, I'll get an expensive foundation because that's the thing that I'll be most seeing on my face.

01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:28.920
But then everything else, I'll be like, very cheap.

01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:33.920
Like, I'll use, like, I like color pop a lot because they're really good for nose or stuff.

01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:36.920
But they don't break the bank.

01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:42.920
Like, I got a lot of blushes and eyeshadow palettes from them.

01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:47.920
But yeah, I'll get like, a really nice foundation and everything else.

01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:50.920
I'll be like, drugstore brand.

01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:54.920
I think that's what a lot of people do too.

01:17:57.920 --> 01:17:58.920
Of course.

01:17:58.920 --> 01:17:59.920
Happy time.

01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:00.920
Happy time.

01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:01.920
Okay.

01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:03.920
On the dress.

01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:11.920
I'm going to go on with my fingers for this.

01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:18.920
So for me personally, I go in and put foundation on my face with my fingers.

01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:21.920
And I kind of finger paint it on.

01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:25.920
But then, I pat it out with a makeup sponge.

01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:27.920
Usually a wet makeup sponge.

01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:31.920
It just makes it, um, it's really good for liquid makeup.

01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:37.920
Uh, just to kind of like, I don't know, make you have like more glowy days.

01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:39.920
I know you can't use crayons.

01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:40.920
I know you eat crayons.

01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:43.920
No, you can't use them on your face either.

01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:52.920
That's on that side, and I'm just going to rub that into my face.

01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:54.920
Lightly.

01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:08.920
You told me the people on the internet.

01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:10.920
Really, you've got to do what works for you.

01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:13.920
It's a lot of trial and error.

01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:20.920
Um, and I've changed my makeup routine a lot over the years.

01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:23.920
Uh, I've also tried to put crayon on my face.

01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:30.920
You might be able to do pastels, like actual wax pastels, I don't know.

01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:31.920
Oh, you can eat them.

01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:32.920
Oh, you can eat them.

01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:34.920
Please don't eat them.

01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:37.920
Uh, no wonder why the kids at school think you're weird.

01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:40.920
I mean, what?

01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:44.920
Um, there are like makeup sticks that look like giant crayons, though.

01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:47.920
It's kind of funny, they're just like foundation sticks.

01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:48.920
Probably even a marker.

01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:52.920
Yeah, that comes off with alcohol, though.

01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:55.920
Yeah, I know like, oh yeah, a lot of beauty.

01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:58.920
And you just like swipe the stick on your face.

01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:01.920
I don't use that though, because it just doesn't work for me.

01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:02.920
I don't know.

01:20:02.920 --> 01:20:04.920
It feels weird.

01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:06.920
I don't like heavy makeup.

01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:08.920
I like makeup that feels light.

01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:11.920
I like using the milk brand for makeup.

01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:14.920
Um, but they're expensive, so I don't really get them anymore.

01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:21.920
I used to get their Sunshine Skin Tint, but that thing was like 40 bucks.

01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:22.920
Okay.

01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:28.920
So, I already have all that makeup sponge here, so I'm going to dab this and kind of blend it.

01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:31.920
So I'm going to blend this into your skin.

01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:40.920
Don't move.

01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:42.920
Close your eyes.

01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:44.920
Close your eyes.

01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:45.920
Close your eyes.

01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:47.920
Close your eyes.

01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:49.920
Close your eyes.

01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:51.920
Close your eyes.

01:20:54.920 --> 01:20:57.920
Close your eyes.

01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:04.920
good job

01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:06.920
good job, just a bit of sound

01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:08.920
just a bit of sound

01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:16.920
do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do

01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:08.620
Boss.

01:22:08.700 --> 01:22:12.620
Okay, that things up and it out really nice

01:22:12.660 --> 01:22:14.180
um, I'm gonna conceal under it.

01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:15.140
I had a little bit.

01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:17.780
Did you sleep last night or are you out playing games?

01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:21.160
You're mom, you know mom doesn't like it.

01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:23.000
I'm gonna play games.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Oh my god, I'm gonna stub this. Oh no. Cool.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:51.000
You know you're not supposed to stay up late. Don't stay up late.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:57.000
I'm mixing up the concealer. Mixing up the concealer.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Okay, I think I mixed it.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Where should I go with this?

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:44.000
Should maybe go under the spine.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:24:04.000
So usually I blend out my concealer with the same sponge, but I'm just gonna use a different brush.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:10.000
Okay, don't move. Don't move, don't move, don't move.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:17.000
Okay, I'm gonna put it right under your mouth.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:22.000
I'm gonna put it under your nose.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:50.000
Okay, thank you for not moving.

01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:10.800

01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:25.600
gonna poke your eyebrows please i'm just gonna pull it you have a urabra let me just

01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:41.520

01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:16.400
don't stay still stay still

01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:36.400
so

01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:48.080
okay you did it you did such a good job i know i know where i know where i just noticed a couple

01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:56.560
of tweezers i should have tweezed them out here but i forgot i'm sorry i'm sorry

01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:06.320
okay okay so we do your eyebrows i have um where is my eyebrow pencil so you can use

01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:12.960
like a pomade that sometimes i use i used to use anastasia but i really use eyebrow pomade

01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:21.760
now i just do that for my eyebrows and test it a little bit and i'm just gonna use

01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:31.760
there you go i forgot to grab it pomade don't move don't move

01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:43.760
okay

01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:54.160
so i have a the mix my eyebrow pencil i'm just gonna pull in your eyebrows real quick did you like

01:28:56.960 --> 01:29:01.040
shave your eyebrow off by the way did you

01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:09.840
maybe shave your eyebrows actually before i do do that i'm gonna set and you set your foundation

01:29:09.840 --> 01:29:17.840
i'm so stupid okay i have long marcia translucent setting powder

01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:27.040
i'll do your eyebrows after i set your foundation because the eyebrow pencil is gonna slide around

01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:29.200
if i don't set it with the powder

01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:30.320
here

01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:40.000
because i put a liquid so setting this kind of makes it more stable it makes it not want to move

01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:49.200
i have my brush here

01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:56.080
okay so i'm gonna

01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:03.280
setting powder

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:12.160
and i'm gonna put a little bit under your eyes just to bake under your eyes a little bit and

01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:16.400
what baking is it just it's a longer time to set so the makeup does increase

01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:22.800
so it fills it all the gaps but you have my skin you don't have any wrinkles or bad pores so you're fine

01:30:30.080 --> 01:30:31.520
i'm gonna tap off the excess

01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:41.360
and it's gonna

01:30:46.480 --> 01:30:54.320
i'm sorry i didn't mean to pull out your ears

01:30:59.920 --> 01:31:02.320
keep your eyes closed

01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:18.320
so

01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:32.000
translucent setting powder it's good to get either translucent powder or powder that

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:37.600
matches your skin just because you don't want to end up like change trials and look like the

01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:44.560
spider from whatever ttb show was where you just have like it's called flashback face

01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:51.840
you're like hi sisters are you just scary buddy

01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:58.160
what happened to me i remember i was out with my family and i think they took a picture of me at

01:31:58.160 --> 01:32:04.560
church and my face was just like white my neck was brown because i put the wrong um setting powder

01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:09.600
on and it looked really funny

01:32:29.760 --> 01:32:31.600
right now i'm just gonna brush it off

01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:43.600
my day is going well thank you

01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:59.600

01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:12.160

01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:26.880
time with me

01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:38.560
oh too much makeup long-term ruined skin that's a great question sibling um it actually won't

01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:44.240
as long as you properly clean it off if you can't put on makeup every day and you didn't wash your

01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:50.640
face then yes it will damage your skin but nothing in makeup um can really damage you unless you're

01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:58.160
allergic to like a fragrance or something i like a something within the makeup otherwise you should

01:33:58.160 --> 01:34:02.800
be fine i've been wearing makeup for 50 years and i look great

01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:10.880
how are you doing the bells are you doing how you doing i hope you're doing well i hope you're

01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:23.120
doing well i hope you're doing well

01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:47.040
well for example you pass out without falling asleep without taking off makeup um that's a

01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:54.320
great question you might wake up with like a bit um because it does it can clog your pores if you

01:34:54.320 --> 01:35:00.880
don't wash it out um but if you wake up you said to wash it off in the morning it shouldn't cause

01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:08.480
any long-term damage i've fallen asleep with makeup on before from the morning i just like wash my

01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:14.960
face really good exfoliate put all the gunk out i'll usually take extra care um and do a little

01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:21.040
bit extra steps in my skincare routine whatever really happens i think it's only happened to me

01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:28.560
like once or twice um even if i'm like not feeling good i usually i will always take my makeup off

01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:39.920
um if you're wondering how to wash your face after you have makeup on because you're probably

01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:47.680
wondering oh she you just did a primer to really make the foundation stay you just set it to your

01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:54.480
skin how am i supposed to get this off well there are special cleansers you can get get it off usually

01:35:54.720 --> 01:36:00.960
oil based cleanser um oil cleansers are ones that are good for your skin and when i say like

01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:06.480
don't put oil on your face i mean like paper that's not the same type of oil that's a heavier um

01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:11.920
it's like a it's a mineral oil with fragrance that's not what like a facial like a cleansing bomb does

01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:21.120
um yeah my cellar water is good no not all of oil um as you know actually eggs are good for a

01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:26.880
face mask eggs are very good uh do not put mineral oil on your face please that will clog your pores

01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:34.560
um you can use makeup wipes so what i do i use um do not clean your face with vegetable oil um

01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:42.640
i usually go in with the makeup wipes and i wipe my makeup off of the wipe and something like that

01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:46.160
actually i have some makeup wipes right here

01:36:55.280 --> 01:37:01.520
and this usually has like my cellar water in it oh no i don't have contact

01:37:03.280 --> 01:37:04.640
let's go for wipe let's go

01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:09.600
um

01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:21.120
and after that i'll usually go in with a salic acid cleaner so that sounds scary when it is but

01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:28.640
again um salic acid is a chemical exfoliant um that is okay and safe for your skin and small

01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:34.480
doses so there's a certain percentage of acid in there um and so i'll do

01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:42.080
just makeup permanently okay it's fine um

01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:49.600
you know don't put gas when you're running in here and um

01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:06.880
and uh i usually do that uh do i usually use um what's it called the ordinary

01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:12.560
no it's the balm i have called a good old cleansing balm

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:15.760
hold on now i need to work it's gonna bother me

01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:26.000
it's gonna bother me oh i'm getting big don't worry about it stop stop getting big

01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:32.000
okay

01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:51.440
it's called the anti-wrist so for skincare the anti-wrist that you can get like

01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:59.680
Sephora or i think Ulta as well um i don't remember but uh the ingredients and the ordinary are

01:38:59.680 --> 01:39:05.040
very affordable um and they're the basic of the ingredients so that's definitely crazy

01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:10.800
okay i don't know what about me

01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:14.640
and um

01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:15.440
um

01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:23.440
i use the old cleansing balm from that and then i wash my face with the old cleansing balm

01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:25.760
i double wash

01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:32.800
but again you also don't want to over wash your face because if you over wash your face you can

01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:40.640
also strip your face of bacteria that needs to be on your face um and it can mess up your

01:39:41.280 --> 01:39:45.840
skin so you want to make sure you use the right stuff to clean your skin

01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:53.040
because you don't want to strip it of its natural oil and then the dryness um can make you break

01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:59.760
out as well because then your body overcompensates for the lack of natural oils and begins to

01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:03.040
over reduce oil you don't want that to happen

01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:13.600
so that's why you don't want to just go in with like a hand soap and water because the hand soap

01:40:14.480 --> 01:40:21.360
is meant to strip any bad bacteria from your hands and it won't dry out your skin and that

01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:24.560
um you don't want to use that on your face because it's hand soap

01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:32.640
if you have a good type of soap that's hydrating and then you put on lotion afterwards then

01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:37.280
you're fine but sometimes um you want to make sure that you hydrate your skin

01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:46.720
um or use like a hydrating cleanser or hydrating soap otherwise you don't dry out your skin and

01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:56.880
it will cause more quick gout okay now that i set your makeup your foundation i plucked your eyebrows

01:40:56.880 --> 01:40:59.760
let's go in and actually do your eyebrows i'm not filling in

01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:09.680
so i need to make it bigger the crayon part is pretty small it's kind of like a pencil

01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:12.640
it's called the mix micro brow pencil

01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:25.360
you don't want to use a five in one face wash because think about it your skin on your body

01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:34.320
your skin on your face um and your hair you're all different um your skin is a giant organ

01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:37.600
it's the biggest organ in your body you want to make sure you take care of it accordingly

01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:42.240
and if you use the same product i don't know it's not going to have the same effect

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:51.200
so yes cleanser toner serum sunscreen motion yes exactly good job

01:41:56.320 --> 01:42:01.120
okay so it turns out i am using this to wash my face in the morning

01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:04.800
yeah no soap not soap soup

01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:11.520
i've been drying out my skin it's not the acne only some more acne took it yeah

01:42:11.520 --> 01:42:17.280
so your body will overproduce oil and it'll clog your skin so if you just get like a nice

01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:22.080
base like again sarah v um i'm gonna give you guys some typical drugstore brands

01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:38.320
so if you get like uh love rose poise uh sarah v um

01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:42.400
let me see

01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:51.360
see the fill is really good you also want to know everybody's skin is different um so i have

01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:58.720
combination skin uh so there's uh there's dry skin combination skin and oily skin um so i have

01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:04.560
patches of my skin that are dry and i have patches that are oily um so you want to make sure you

01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:10.480
have a cleanser for that but if you really dry skin you want to have a more hydrating um water

01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:24.800
based uh um cleanser and and if you have a um oily skin you want um something that won't be as

01:43:24.800 --> 01:43:31.680
heavy on your skin otherwise you're just gonna clock it up again uh so yeah and you also you

01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:40.080
might have sensitive skin it's a lot of trial and error to get the right uh type of um skin

01:43:41.440 --> 01:43:47.600
care routine that's why i really like seida fill and sarah v because uh you can get like a gentle

01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:52.320
foaming cleanser to start off with and um you can kind of work your way up from there

01:43:52.320 --> 01:44:02.080
and then like i used to have oily skin but now i have combination skin yeah vino is good

01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:09.280
ole dove dove is surprising is like dove is trusted and true yeah skin ph exactly

01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:17.040
um your diet does also factor in uh don't wash your please don't wash your face with hand soap

01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:23.680
again when you wash your face with hand soap your hands come into contact with lots of different

01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:29.520
bacteria you use that to maneuver things in the world it's a very harsh soap because your hands

01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:35.120
can handle it um because that's what they're meant for but then your face it's not meant for that

01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:39.760
i'll put it on your face

01:44:43.680 --> 01:44:48.800
do not put hand sanitizer on your face that just lets it burn um you can spot treat

01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:55.280
if you're gonna spot treat something um you can put like a little dab of a witch hazel or a little

01:44:55.280 --> 01:45:03.360
dab of um alcohol like rubbing alcohol just to dry it out um but you want to do that if it's not

01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:10.880
if your skin isn't positively um reacting to that then stop you really want to try you want to

01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:16.400
test stuff out you never want to go in put something all over your face you want to spot check stuff

01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:24.960
otherwise um you might irritate your skin and you don't want to irritate your skin

01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:36.320
like i love um miyana and i love her uh lingerie brand the savage xfifty um she also has a skincare

01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:44.400
brand uh i have a friend and her skin works amazing with her skincare brand but then i discovered

01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:50.080
that i am actually allergic to something in her skincare when i tried it out she had really awesome

01:45:50.160 --> 01:45:53.840
toner and like lotion and stuff but i don't know what i was allergic to

01:45:53.840 --> 01:45:58.240
and it would make my skin break out even more now that's just me it works for other people

01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:01.200
it might not work for you it might work for you

01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:08.800
sorry she be society doesn't advertise to guys how to take care of your skin

01:46:08.800 --> 01:46:17.040
yeah that's because for you guys from men it's mostly focused that you you know eat well and you

01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:23.920
look good physically um in terms of like your body type um for women it's really our face and like

01:46:23.920 --> 01:46:33.600
i'll wait so i'm not um they don't usually um uh they won't i know like some brands like they'll

01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:40.720
advertise stuff like my dad is a very meticulously groomed man sometimes i'll make fun of him for

01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:46.400
that and sometimes my mom does but he like my dad will do his skincare um and stuff too um

01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:54.880
and he'll do like an under eye cream and then do like a special lotion um also if you're elderly

01:46:54.880 --> 01:47:01.840
like myself i'm 56 um you want to you can add like a serum if you get like a retinol cream

01:47:01.840 --> 01:47:09.040
a retinol is really good for anti aging um you want to i highly recommend there's a i can't remember

01:47:09.040 --> 01:47:14.080
exactly what it's called but there's a cycle you want to go through when it comes to your skin

01:47:14.080 --> 01:47:19.920
care for the best results um and you want to cycle through the serums use i'm not going to get into

01:47:19.920 --> 01:47:31.600
all that you can just youtube that but there is like a cycle women are just very more particular

01:47:31.600 --> 01:47:41.040
about how we groom ourselves because again we groom ourselves for men um and then obviously

01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:46.880
for ourselves as well because what makes us feel good but um and a lot of female feminine products

01:47:46.880 --> 01:47:52.720
were created by men so it's very interesting but then the men don't use that for themselves because

01:47:52.720 --> 01:47:58.480
normally it doesn't affect them as much because again our hormones um

01:48:00.880 --> 01:48:04.880
are different than men men like we both have testosterone and estrogen we do some different

01:48:04.880 --> 01:48:14.880
levels it can be expensive but um there are so many budget friendly uh routines you can do

01:48:14.880 --> 01:48:24.320
whether it may be for makeup or for um what's it called or for skincare like i didn't come out the

01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:33.280
gate using like tart and like really expensive makeup and skincare brands oh i just want to

01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:41.040
like cvs or ride aid and just like got the basic stuff that's all you really need yeah it's chemistry

01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:54.000
yeah that is the pink tax that's usually well i'll buy like some men's products like i'll buy

01:48:54.000 --> 01:49:00.560
men's deodorant and i'll buy men's razors because women's razors are also not as well made

01:49:01.200 --> 01:49:08.880
same with the deodorant and um they will be a lot more expensive like one razor for a woman

01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:12.240
might be like 20 bucks but for a guy who'll get like three for the same amount

01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:24.000
um and really again i will recommend for like budget friendly stuff i like sarah v and setafil

01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:30.000
um you can just search like 13 best 12 best 10 best drugstore brands

01:49:30.800 --> 01:49:39.840
does it men's deodorant smell like men yeah but my hair products overwhelm what my armpits smell

01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:46.480
like so you only really smell my hair and my hair smells like candy so i still smell like a girl

01:49:51.040 --> 01:49:55.040
i want to do a face routine but i'm scared i might ruin my face more i guess i'll just water um

01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:02.160
um actually if you you know there's stuff in your water right like if you use just half water

01:50:03.440 --> 01:50:09.840
your water can be hard it can have like um different ph levels in it that can also dry out your skin

01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:20.640
three and one stuff is bad don't use three and one stuff if you're gonna get get get separate

01:50:20.640 --> 01:50:27.200
stuff you want something that will specially shampoo your hair you don't want to use the same

01:50:27.200 --> 01:50:31.040
stuff on your hair as on your body it might not be as effective i swear so

01:50:36.400 --> 01:50:40.400
but um if your skin is sensitive then you need to act accordingly

01:50:40.400 --> 01:50:48.960
so i'm just tapping on this pen it's on the tap on with my hair

01:50:51.600 --> 01:50:52.960
i'm just gonna brush

01:50:56.880 --> 01:50:59.520
my brows a little bit they're a little bit wild

01:51:03.280 --> 01:51:10.160
what's nice about this next thing is that i can um it has one end be the pencil and one end be

01:51:10.160 --> 01:51:12.480
the brush i can just brush it

01:51:21.040 --> 01:51:26.720
but honestly i bet that i don't um again i only know like girl recommendations so

01:51:26.720 --> 01:51:33.760
if you want me to guys i can i can do some research for you and i can make like another

01:51:33.760 --> 01:51:40.240
doing your like face and skin um but i can cure it specifically towards men um

01:51:41.360 --> 01:51:46.720
not that this won't work for you but i'll just specifically use like men's brands um and if

01:51:46.720 --> 01:51:52.320
you have a beard maybe you'll like like i'm in the beard oil or if you're bald like a bald man

01:51:52.320 --> 01:52:02.880
oil doesn't an electric razor work for a body here too so you don't have to get so many disposable

01:52:02.880 --> 01:52:09.200
ones um women don't really get marketed electric razors men do for when they shave their beavers

01:52:09.200 --> 01:52:10.160
and stuff but women don't

01:52:17.120 --> 01:52:19.200
okay now that

01:52:19.200 --> 01:52:29.520
uh

01:52:29.520 --> 01:52:39.520
do light strokes

01:52:40.240 --> 01:52:45.840
short light strokes

01:52:56.160 --> 01:53:03.440
i remember i like got manscaped for myself because again i wanted like men's razors are

01:53:03.440 --> 01:53:09.040
significantly cheaper now i just use drill it men's razors are significantly cheaper than women's

01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:13.040
and i don't like manscaped because i kept making my kuchi anytime i tried to shave

01:53:14.240 --> 01:53:17.760
and i kept cutting my legs on accident so i don't know if the blades were so sharp

01:53:17.760 --> 01:53:22.560
i want to try getting a single blade blade single edge whatever those things are called

01:53:24.240 --> 01:53:31.360
you know how hard it hurts so much when you cut your pussy lip it hurts a lot guys

01:53:39.200 --> 01:53:43.120
well there's me using all the things seems more than against nobody's skin is different

01:53:43.120 --> 01:53:47.040
what will work for someone will not work for you what will work for you might not work for

01:53:47.040 --> 01:53:51.520
someone else doesn't miss sharing my knowledge you don't have to change anything it's just

01:53:51.520 --> 01:53:58.720
suggestions and recommendations and sometimes it's also down to genetics like it's that simple

01:53:58.720 --> 01:54:02.880
like you might not have to do anything you just wake up throw water on your face and you walk out

01:54:02.880 --> 01:54:10.080
the door and that could be genetic me i'm more acne prone um my mom still has acne and she's

01:54:10.080 --> 01:54:17.680
in her 70s and i'm 50 um and i just never went away and so i get the occasional breakout when

01:54:17.680 --> 01:54:23.520
i was normal when you're in an age when you're a man and a woman um you stop breaking out but

01:54:24.160 --> 01:54:30.720
genetically just don't so i try to do preventative measures to stop really bad breakouts

01:54:34.320 --> 01:54:41.360
sometimes it's a hormonal thing um so like for example i'm on medication for um

01:54:43.280 --> 01:54:50.320
my acne because i'll get it like on my body that's annoying because i can't i told you guys

01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:55.600
like i scar easily so like you know red dot for me it just turned into a brown dot and so i'll

01:54:55.600 --> 01:55:13.040
just have like spots and i'm like i'm a leopard so i'll take i take um like a antibiotic and it

01:55:13.040 --> 01:55:22.480
actually kills the bacteria that makes um okay so your eyebrows are nicely filled in i gave you a

01:55:33.520 --> 01:55:46.880
eye shadow yeah yeah i totally feel that um and that's another reason why i i'm very self-conscious

01:55:46.880 --> 01:55:55.600
about my skin so that's why i don't know what anybody see me no man will perceive me or gaze upon me

01:55:56.400 --> 01:56:00.800
i'm an idiot no he doesn't see me but like no i'm a woman i have womanly thoughts

01:56:01.040 --> 01:56:04.560

02:00:17.200 --> 02:00:26.960

02:00:36.800 --> 02:00:43.920
squeezy as a base it's like this golden color um and then i'll put easy peasy which is like a

02:00:43.920 --> 02:00:51.280
shimmer on it and then i'll kind of contour your eye with um a little bit like a little bit of

02:00:51.280 --> 02:00:55.440
smoke for the with tusk and phone and best but we do

02:01:04.480 --> 02:01:05.360
tap on that

02:01:22.240 --> 02:01:23.040
that song

02:01:30.320 --> 02:01:31.440
okay so

02:01:41.200 --> 02:01:42.960
yeah tap off the excess hold on

02:01:47.440 --> 02:01:47.940

02:01:51.520 --> 02:01:52.240
and

02:01:54.560 --> 02:01:55.600
i'm

02:02:18.400 --> 02:02:19.680
okay it's a brush

02:02:21.280 --> 02:02:27.280
Where's my blending brush? I need a blending brush.

02:02:28.280 --> 02:02:37.280
Yeah, so I'm just gonna blend, blend, blend, blend, blend, blend...

02:02:38.280 --> 02:02:42.280
Cos you don't want it to clump in one spot, we don't want it to clump in one spot.

02:02:46.280 --> 02:02:49.280
Perfect! Perfect, perfect, perfect.

02:02:49.280 --> 02:02:54.280
Okay, it looks really cute.

02:02:54.280 --> 02:02:59.280
So I put the base down, so I'm just gonna go in with another brush.

02:02:59.280 --> 02:03:01.280
Cause I don't want to use the same brush.

02:03:01.280 --> 02:03:03.280
I really keep my brushes separate.

02:03:03.280 --> 02:03:06.280
I have a lot of different types of brushes.

02:03:06.280 --> 02:03:10.280
Usually girls don't always use the same brush.

02:03:10.280 --> 02:03:13.280
We use lots of different type of brushes.

02:03:13.280 --> 02:03:16.280
Oh, is there a peelio on this one?

02:03:16.280 --> 02:03:20.280
Oh, the ones I never took the peelio off of this.

02:03:20.280 --> 02:03:23.280
Right here, there's a really nice peelio.

02:03:26.280 --> 02:03:28.280
Oh, that was great.

02:03:28.280 --> 02:03:29.280
Wow, this is...

02:03:29.280 --> 02:03:31.280
Ooh, that looks good.

02:03:31.280 --> 02:03:33.280
Oh, there's a peelio in the mirror.

02:03:33.280 --> 02:03:34.280
Wow, that looks so cute.

02:03:34.280 --> 02:03:36.280
Oh my god, why do I look so cute?

02:03:36.280 --> 02:03:37.280
What the hell?

02:03:37.280 --> 02:03:40.280
Okay, sorry to get distracted about how cute I am.

02:03:41.280 --> 02:03:42.280
Okay.

02:03:45.280 --> 02:03:46.280
I'm playing and...

02:03:46.280 --> 02:03:48.280
I need to put on some chapstick.

02:03:48.280 --> 02:03:49.280
Oh.

02:03:52.280 --> 02:03:53.280
Okay, I'll put on some chapstick later.

02:03:53.280 --> 02:03:55.280
I'm still looking at my lips for now.

02:03:57.280 --> 02:03:58.280
Okay.

02:03:59.280 --> 02:04:01.280
Let me get some more.

02:04:03.280 --> 02:04:04.280
Okay, I got some more.

02:04:04.280 --> 02:04:07.280
So I'm gonna brush easy peasy over your lid.

02:04:08.280 --> 02:04:10.280
Um, put on some...

02:04:12.280 --> 02:04:14.280
Just a little bit.

02:04:14.280 --> 02:04:15.280
Just a little bit.

02:04:25.280 --> 02:04:26.280
Sorry.

02:04:27.280 --> 02:04:28.280
Don't move.

02:04:28.280 --> 02:04:30.280
Close your eyes.

02:04:30.280 --> 02:04:32.280
Close, close, close, close, close.

02:04:32.280 --> 02:04:36.280
You better be close, close, close, close, close, close, close, close, close.

02:04:36.280 --> 02:04:39.280
Are they closed? Are they closed?

02:04:39.280 --> 02:04:40.280
Go ahead

02:04:49.280 --> 02:04:50.280
Done

02:04:51.280 --> 02:04:52.280
Cool

02:04:53.280 --> 02:04:54.280
Okay, that looks good

02:04:54.280 --> 02:04:55.280
That looks so cute

02:04:55.280 --> 02:04:56.280
Oh my god, okay

02:04:56.280 --> 02:05:01.280
I'm gonna go in with a little bit of Tuscany Gone

02:05:01.280 --> 02:05:03.280
and that's what I'm gonna mix

02:05:03.280 --> 02:05:07.280
I'm just gonna do outside corners of the eyes

02:05:07.280 --> 02:05:09.280
A little bit of smoke

02:05:09.280 --> 02:05:11.280
Just a little bit of smoke

02:05:12.280 --> 02:05:14.280
A little bit of smoke

02:05:23.280 --> 02:05:24.280
Okay, perfect

02:05:24.280 --> 02:05:28.280
Okay, now that we've got the eyeshadow

02:05:28.280 --> 02:05:30.280
Usually you want to do eyeshadow before you do eyeliner

02:05:30.280 --> 02:05:34.280
Otherwise, you're just gonna go over your eyeliner and that's it

02:05:34.280 --> 02:05:36.280
So I got...

02:05:36.280 --> 02:05:38.280
I don't know what you just...

02:05:43.280 --> 02:05:45.280
Okay, got the eyeliner

02:05:45.280 --> 02:05:47.280
So this is a pencil liner

02:05:49.280 --> 02:05:52.280
Actually, it's like a marker, you know what I'm talking about?

02:05:53.280 --> 02:06:00.280
So, usually, I personally don't like pencil liners

02:06:00.280 --> 02:06:02.280
I prefer liquid liners

02:06:02.280 --> 02:06:04.280
but everybody is different

02:06:04.280 --> 02:06:09.280
So, what type of eyeliner do you want?

02:06:09.280 --> 02:06:10.280
Do you want like a little wing?

02:06:10.280 --> 02:06:12.280
Do you want like a big cat eye?

02:06:13.280 --> 02:06:16.280
I can do like a little bit

02:06:16.280 --> 02:06:18.280
like little wings on the other

02:06:18.280 --> 02:06:20.280
and like mine

02:06:26.280 --> 02:06:27.280
Do you want to like mine?

02:06:27.280 --> 02:06:31.280
Because I have pretty good eyeliner on my eye

02:06:31.280 --> 02:06:33.280
My eyeliner is one for you

02:06:33.280 --> 02:06:35.280
as a kid, so...

02:06:37.280 --> 02:06:38.280
You want like me?

02:06:38.280 --> 02:06:40.280
Okay, I'll do like me

02:06:44.280 --> 02:06:45.280
You have to...

02:06:45.280 --> 02:06:46.280
You can't move

02:06:47.280 --> 02:06:49.280
In fact, I need a whole new one

02:06:50.280 --> 02:06:52.280
I need to shake this up

02:06:52.280 --> 02:06:56.280
So I'm using NYX Professional Epic Ink Liner

02:06:56.280 --> 02:06:58.280
That's the one I use a lot of proof

02:06:58.280 --> 02:07:00.280
And it is pretty good

02:07:00.280 --> 02:07:02.280
I'm gonna shake it up a little bit

02:07:03.280 --> 02:07:05.280
Okay, one of those

02:07:17.280 --> 02:07:19.280
I'm just going to...

02:07:19.280 --> 02:07:21.280
Hold me up, like hold you

02:07:24.280 --> 02:07:29.280
Okay, so I'm just a little wing

02:07:33.280 --> 02:07:34.280
Close your eyes

02:07:34.280 --> 02:07:37.280
Close, close, close, close, close, close, close

02:07:41.280 --> 02:07:42.280
Hold on, close, keep your eye

02:07:42.280 --> 02:07:43.280
Can you like...

02:07:43.280 --> 02:07:45.280
Yeah, just like, yeah, like that, thank you

02:07:45.280 --> 02:07:47.280
I'm just gonna fill it in a little bit

02:07:47.280 --> 02:07:48.280
I don't really kind of miss a spot

02:07:48.280 --> 02:07:49.280
Okay, perfect

02:07:50.280 --> 02:07:52.280
Okay, let me do the other eye

02:07:57.280 --> 02:07:58.280
Other eye

02:08:01.280 --> 02:08:02.280
Just gonna go in

02:08:03.280 --> 02:08:05.280
Close, close, close, close, close

02:08:05.280 --> 02:08:06.280
Holding you down

02:08:08.280 --> 02:08:10.280
Perfect, and done

02:08:11.280 --> 02:08:13.280
Nice, okay

02:08:13.280 --> 02:08:15.280
I thought you were gonna move

02:08:15.280 --> 02:08:18.280
And make me go across your face

02:08:18.280 --> 02:08:20.280
So I'm happy that didn't work out

02:08:20.280 --> 02:08:22.280
That made that work out

02:08:22.280 --> 02:08:23.280
Let me...

02:08:24.280 --> 02:08:28.280
So now, what I'm gonna do

02:08:29.280 --> 02:08:32.280
I'm gonna get some mascara

02:08:32.280 --> 02:08:33.280
Yep, don't you worry

02:08:33.280 --> 02:08:36.280
So for mascara, my true...

02:08:37.280 --> 02:08:38.280
Why don't I...

02:08:38.280 --> 02:08:39.280
Oh, I got the brush

02:08:43.280 --> 02:08:47.280
The mascara I've used for years

02:08:47.280 --> 02:08:50.280
Is roller lash by Benefit

02:08:50.280 --> 02:08:51.280
It's my favorite

02:08:55.280 --> 02:08:57.280
Hold on, let me get the mascara out

02:09:00.280 --> 02:09:01.280
There we go

02:09:13.280 --> 02:09:30.280
Sometimes I'll put it on my top and bottom lash

02:09:30.280 --> 02:09:32.280
But really, I've been just doing my top lash

02:09:32.280 --> 02:09:34.280
I have naturally super long eyelashes

02:09:34.280 --> 02:09:36.280
So I usually get asked if I wear falsies

02:09:36.280 --> 02:09:38.280
When I use this mascara

02:09:38.280 --> 02:09:39.280
I don't use falsies

02:09:39.280 --> 02:09:42.280
I just have natural and curling and long eyelashes

02:09:42.280 --> 02:09:44.280
Thank you, genetics

02:09:44.280 --> 02:09:49.280
Okay, this is gonna be very hard

02:09:49.280 --> 02:09:57.280
Because you have to look up

02:09:58.280 --> 02:10:00.280
So you have to look up

02:10:04.280 --> 02:10:05.280
So look up

02:10:06.280 --> 02:10:10.280
And I'm just gonna wipe this under your eye, okay?

02:10:10.280 --> 02:10:13.280
So, please, you...

02:10:14.280 --> 02:10:15.280
Ready?

02:10:16.280 --> 02:10:17.280
Which one do you want me to do?

02:10:18.280 --> 02:10:20.280
Which one do you want me to do?

02:10:23.280 --> 02:10:25.280
Which one do you want me to start with?

02:10:26.280 --> 02:10:28.280
My left eye? Your left eye?

02:10:28.280 --> 02:10:29.280
Okay

02:10:32.280 --> 02:10:34.280
My left or your left?

02:10:37.280 --> 02:10:38.280
Ready?

02:10:38.280 --> 02:10:39.280
Look up

02:10:40.280 --> 02:10:41.280
Oh

02:10:43.280 --> 02:10:44.280
You moved

02:10:44.280 --> 02:10:45.280
Why did you move?

02:10:45.280 --> 02:10:47.280
I just poked you in the eye

02:10:48.280 --> 02:10:50.280
And you have mascara on your nose now

02:10:53.280 --> 02:10:56.280
God, sweetie, why did you move?

02:10:58.280 --> 02:10:59.280
Okay, hold on

02:10:59.280 --> 02:11:00.280
Let me wipe it

02:11:00.280 --> 02:11:01.280
Let me wipe it

02:11:01.280 --> 02:11:02.280
Look up, look up

02:11:02.280 --> 02:11:03.280
Do you like that?

02:11:03.280 --> 02:11:04.280
It's okay

02:11:05.280 --> 02:11:08.280
I'm gonna get a little bit of cleanser

02:11:08.280 --> 02:11:10.280
And then I'm just gonna wipe it

02:11:11.280 --> 02:11:13.280
I told you not to move

02:11:17.280 --> 02:11:19.280
Okay, you're fine

02:11:19.280 --> 02:11:21.280
Okay, let's try this again

02:11:21.280 --> 02:11:22.280
Let's try this again

02:11:22.280 --> 02:11:23.280
You'll be okay

02:11:26.280 --> 02:11:27.280
Okay

02:11:27.280 --> 02:11:29.280
I'm gonna do the other eye this time, okay?

02:11:29.280 --> 02:11:32.280
So look up and just don't move

02:11:32.280 --> 02:11:36.280
And then as I'm moving my hand

02:11:36.280 --> 02:11:38.280
You can slowly blink, okay?

02:11:38.280 --> 02:11:39.280
Ready?

02:11:39.280 --> 02:11:40.280
Like this

02:11:40.280 --> 02:11:41.280
Watch, watch me, watch me

02:11:41.280 --> 02:11:42.280
Watch me

02:11:49.280 --> 02:11:50.280
So I'm gonna look up

02:11:54.280 --> 02:11:55.280
Look up

02:11:59.280 --> 02:12:00.280
You got it?

02:12:01.280 --> 02:12:03.280
What if you're blind and cancel or I'm looking?

02:12:03.280 --> 02:12:04.280
How are you typing?

02:12:04.280 --> 02:12:05.280
I'm very impressed

02:12:06.280 --> 02:12:09.280
Okay, perfect

02:12:36.280 --> 02:12:37.280
Okay

02:12:45.280 --> 02:12:47.280
Good, good, that worked

02:12:47.280 --> 02:12:49.280
Next one, next one, good job

02:12:49.280 --> 02:12:50.280
Okay

02:13:05.280 --> 02:13:07.280
Nice, good job

02:13:08.280 --> 02:13:10.280
Nice job, nice job, perfect

02:13:12.280 --> 02:13:15.280
Oh, my mouth is open

02:13:20.280 --> 02:13:21.280
So

02:13:22.280 --> 02:13:23.280
Now you did that

02:13:24.280 --> 02:13:25.280
Nice job

02:13:26.280 --> 02:13:29.280
I think I'm gonna add some blush on you now

02:13:29.280 --> 02:13:31.280
So let me get

02:13:34.280 --> 02:13:36.280
Nope, hold on, let me find the right one

02:13:37.280 --> 02:13:38.280
Got it

02:13:39.280 --> 02:13:40.280
Alright, hold on

02:13:41.280 --> 02:13:42.280
Let me close it

02:13:50.280 --> 02:13:51.280
Okay

02:14:08.280 --> 02:14:11.280
Oh, sorry, I had to go somewhere

02:14:19.280 --> 02:14:20.280
Okay

02:14:24.280 --> 02:14:25.280
Don't look at my boobs

02:14:25.280 --> 02:14:26.280
That's weird

02:14:26.280 --> 02:14:27.280
I'm your sister

02:14:28.280 --> 02:14:29.280
Kind of awkward

02:14:30.280 --> 02:14:31.280
Okay

02:14:31.280 --> 02:14:32.280
Cool, cool, cool

02:14:32.280 --> 02:14:34.280
Alright, I think that's good

02:14:35.280 --> 02:14:37.280
Oops, what am I pressing on?

02:14:41.280 --> 02:14:42.280
Alright

02:14:43.280 --> 02:14:44.280
Don't

02:14:44.280 --> 02:14:46.280
Stop looking at my boobs

02:14:50.280 --> 02:14:52.280
Alright, let me use

02:15:05.280 --> 02:15:07.280
Why are you just

02:15:07.280 --> 02:15:09.280
Why are you just staring?

02:15:10.280 --> 02:15:12.280
Can you please stop?

02:15:13.280 --> 02:15:15.280
That's very appropriate

02:15:15.280 --> 02:15:16.280
Okay

02:15:19.280 --> 02:15:20.280
My god

02:15:21.280 --> 02:15:22.280
Alright

02:15:22.280 --> 02:15:24.280
So you got your blush

02:15:24.280 --> 02:15:27.280
Okay, I think we need to give you a nice whip

02:15:28.280 --> 02:15:29.280
Like

02:15:29.280 --> 02:15:31.280
A little whip, a little

02:15:31.280 --> 02:15:33.280
A little whippy whip

02:15:33.280 --> 02:15:34.280
A little, oh

02:15:38.280 --> 02:15:39.280
Sorry

02:15:39.280 --> 02:15:41.280
Alright, come here, come here, come here

02:15:41.280 --> 02:15:42.280
I need it

02:15:43.280 --> 02:15:44.280
Alright

02:15:45.280 --> 02:15:47.280
I need a problem

02:15:47.280 --> 02:15:48.280
Lipstick

02:15:51.280 --> 02:15:53.280
I can find the lipstick

02:15:53.280 --> 02:15:55.280
Sometimes these towels don't work

02:15:55.280 --> 02:15:56.280
Oh, found it

02:15:58.280 --> 02:15:59.280
The lipstick hasn't found

02:15:59.280 --> 02:16:00.280
Alright

02:16:02.280 --> 02:16:03.280
Using

02:16:04.280 --> 02:16:05.280
I think that's nice

02:16:12.280 --> 02:16:13.280
Mm-hmm

02:16:17.280 --> 02:16:19.280
So before, actually, I put lipstick on you

02:16:19.280 --> 02:16:21.280
I'm gonna put on some chapstick on you

02:16:22.280 --> 02:16:23.280
Because I'm gonna

02:16:23.280 --> 02:16:25.280
Hydrate those lips

02:16:30.280 --> 02:16:32.280
Can you push your lips like this?

02:16:32.280 --> 02:16:34.280
Well, push your lips

02:16:34.280 --> 02:16:35.280
Like that

02:16:36.280 --> 02:16:37.280
Please

02:16:38.280 --> 02:16:39.280
Please, please, please

02:16:39.280 --> 02:16:40.280
Can you

02:16:40.280 --> 02:16:41.280
Can you give me a kiss?

02:16:41.280 --> 02:16:42.280
I know you like to

02:16:42.280 --> 02:16:43.280
You wanna give me a kiss

02:16:58.280 --> 02:16:59.280
Okay, perfect

02:16:59.280 --> 02:17:00.280
Okay

02:17:00.280 --> 02:17:01.280
Let's first

02:17:09.280 --> 02:17:10.280
Okay

02:17:10.280 --> 02:17:13.280
Now I'm gonna put my lip on your chapstick

02:17:13.280 --> 02:17:15.280
I'm gonna put on

02:17:15.280 --> 02:17:17.280
The lipstick

02:17:17.280 --> 02:17:18.280
So

02:17:19.280 --> 02:17:20.280
First

02:17:21.280 --> 02:17:22.280
Right now

02:17:22.280 --> 02:17:23.280
Okay

02:17:23.280 --> 02:17:24.280
Mm-hmm

02:17:24.280 --> 02:17:26.280
Mm-hmm

02:17:30.280 --> 02:17:31.280
Okay

02:17:44.280 --> 02:17:45.280
Perfect

02:17:45.280 --> 02:17:46.280
You smack your lips there like this

02:17:46.280 --> 02:17:47.280
Mm-hmm

02:17:47.280 --> 02:17:48.280
Mm-hmm

02:17:48.280 --> 02:17:50.280
Mm-hmm

02:17:50.280 --> 02:17:51.280
Mm-hmm

02:18:00.280 --> 02:18:01.280
Okay

02:18:03.280 --> 02:18:04.280
Have a kiss

02:18:05.280 --> 02:18:07.280
Come on, you wanna give me a kiss

02:18:08.280 --> 02:18:09.280
Come on, Ricky

02:18:09.280 --> 02:18:10.280
Give me a kiss on the tree

02:18:13.280 --> 02:18:14.280
Right there

02:18:14.280 --> 02:18:15.280
Give me a kiss on the tree

02:18:22.280 --> 02:18:24.280
Aw, I see that wasn't so hard

02:18:24.280 --> 02:18:26.280
Good job

02:18:27.280 --> 02:18:28.280
Nice

02:18:29.280 --> 02:18:30.280
Nice

02:18:31.280 --> 02:18:33.280
My hand is small

02:18:40.280 --> 02:18:42.280
Sorry, let me back up

02:18:42.280 --> 02:18:43.280
Nope

02:18:43.280 --> 02:18:44.280
Um

02:18:44.280 --> 02:18:45.280
Don't look at that

02:18:47.280 --> 02:18:48.280
Nope

02:18:50.280 --> 02:18:52.280
I'm tilting myself

02:18:53.280 --> 02:18:54.280
Uh

02:18:59.280 --> 02:19:00.280
Uh

02:19:03.280 --> 02:19:05.280
Don't worry about it

02:19:08.280 --> 02:19:09.280
Um, okay

02:19:09.280 --> 02:19:12.280
So now I'm gonna set your makeup with the setting spray

02:19:12.280 --> 02:19:15.280
Just another layer to lock it all in

02:19:15.280 --> 02:19:18.280
Lock it, lock it, lock it, lock it, lock it in

02:19:18.280 --> 02:19:20.280
Lock it in, lock it in, lock it in

02:19:22.280 --> 02:19:24.280
Yes, I'm wearing good at cartwheels

02:19:24.280 --> 02:19:26.280
Lock, lock it, lock it

02:19:26.280 --> 02:19:28.280
Pop, lock and drop it

02:19:28.280 --> 02:19:29.280
Lock it

02:19:31.280 --> 02:19:34.280
Okay, so I like to use

02:19:40.280 --> 02:19:42.280
The collier

02:19:42.280 --> 02:19:45.280
Oh, debouté beauty mixer

02:19:45.280 --> 02:19:47.280
As a setting spray

02:19:47.280 --> 02:19:48.280
It's also good just for like

02:19:48.280 --> 02:19:49.280
Just to spray on your face

02:19:49.280 --> 02:19:51.280
Just to kind of re-energize it

02:19:51.280 --> 02:19:56.280
Sorry, I'm just shaking it up

02:19:56.280 --> 02:19:58.280
Because the product is all separated

02:20:00.280 --> 02:20:01.280
Okay

02:20:01.280 --> 02:20:03.280
So let me just

02:20:11.280 --> 02:20:12.280
Nice

02:20:13.280 --> 02:20:15.280
It also smells good

02:20:15.280 --> 02:20:16.280
What's in it?

02:20:16.280 --> 02:20:17.280
Um

02:20:20.280 --> 02:20:22.280
It's too small, I honestly can't read that

02:20:22.280 --> 02:20:23.280
It's also dark

02:20:25.280 --> 02:20:27.280
What is this font?

02:20:28.280 --> 02:20:29.280
Water

02:20:29.280 --> 02:20:31.280
Citrus

02:20:32.280 --> 02:20:35.280
Something in Latin

02:20:41.280 --> 02:20:44.280
Rosemary, leaf oil, potassium

02:20:44.280 --> 02:20:46.280
I can't tell

02:20:47.280 --> 02:20:50.280
And you don't want to touch your face for that?

02:20:51.280 --> 02:20:52.280
Um, alright

02:20:52.280 --> 02:20:54.280
You know what it should have done?

02:20:54.280 --> 02:20:55.280
I should have contoured

02:20:55.280 --> 02:20:56.280
But it's fine

02:20:56.280 --> 02:20:58.280
You don't really need contour

02:20:58.280 --> 02:21:00.280
I don't like contour

02:21:00.280 --> 02:21:01.280
You don't need contour

02:21:02.280 --> 02:21:03.280
Alright

02:21:04.280 --> 02:21:05.280
What do you think?

02:21:06.280 --> 02:21:08.280
Take a look, here

02:21:08.280 --> 02:21:10.280
I'm handing you the compact

02:21:10.280 --> 02:21:11.280
What do you think?

02:21:11.280 --> 02:21:13.280
I'm handing you the compact

02:21:13.280 --> 02:21:14.280
What do you think?

02:21:36.280 --> 02:21:38.280
I think you look really lovely

02:21:41.280 --> 02:21:42.280
Yeah, hold on, let me get out of the way

02:21:42.280 --> 02:21:44.280
Let me let me let you look in the mirror

02:21:44.280 --> 02:21:46.280
Let me let you look in the mirror

02:21:47.280 --> 02:21:49.280
Why don't you walk over to the mirror

02:21:58.280 --> 02:22:01.280
Wow, you look so good

02:22:03.280 --> 02:22:05.280
You look so amazing

02:22:05.280 --> 02:22:10.280
Wow, I

02:22:13.280 --> 02:22:16.280
You look so good in the mirror right now

02:22:17.280 --> 02:22:18.280
Are you mewing?

02:22:18.280 --> 02:22:20.280
Have you been mewing lately?

02:22:25.280 --> 02:22:26.280
You're mocking everybody

02:22:26.280 --> 02:22:27.280
You look like a model

02:22:28.280 --> 02:22:30.280
Have you ever considered becoming a model?

02:22:32.280 --> 02:22:33.280
Your eyebrows are on fleek

02:22:33.280 --> 02:22:35.280
It gave you that good arch

02:22:35.280 --> 02:22:37.280
Bust your hair out so you look nice

02:22:37.280 --> 02:22:39.280
You're perching your lips

02:22:40.280 --> 02:22:42.280
You look really good

02:22:44.280 --> 02:22:45.280
You got really nice lips

02:22:45.280 --> 02:22:47.280
I don't even have to contour your nose or anything

02:22:47.280 --> 02:22:49.280
You can see a little bit of a shadow

02:22:49.280 --> 02:22:51.280
I kept it nice and light

02:22:52.280 --> 02:22:54.280
And it really goes with your outfit

02:22:58.280 --> 02:22:59.280
Wow

02:22:59.280 --> 02:23:01.280
Come back come back here

02:23:01.280 --> 02:23:02.280
Come back over

02:23:03.280 --> 02:23:04.280
Nice, nice

02:23:04.280 --> 02:23:06.280
I think I did a good job

02:23:06.280 --> 02:23:07.280
What do you guys think?

02:23:15.280 --> 02:23:16.280
Wonderful features

02:23:17.280 --> 02:23:19.280
I don't know why you don't have everybody

02:23:19.280 --> 02:23:21.280
Boys and girls, you know

02:23:21.280 --> 02:23:23.280
Blasting after you

02:23:24.280 --> 02:23:26.280
You look gorgeous

02:23:32.280 --> 02:23:34.280
Now you can get everyone

02:23:34.280 --> 02:23:38.280
You can pull any fit bird that your heart desires

02:23:43.280 --> 02:23:44.280
Wait, you have a crush on somebody?

02:23:44.280 --> 02:23:45.280
There's a girl that you like

02:23:45.280 --> 02:23:47.280
Tell me, who's the girl?

02:23:47.280 --> 02:23:49.280
Who's the girl that you like?

02:23:50.280 --> 02:23:52.280
I hope they treat you right

02:23:52.280 --> 02:23:54.280
Otherwise we're going to have problems

02:23:54.280 --> 02:23:56.280
I don't want to have to

02:23:57.280 --> 02:23:59.280
Have to take care of anybody

02:24:00.280 --> 02:24:01.280
It's me?

02:24:14.280 --> 02:24:16.280
That's really sweet and all

02:24:17.280 --> 02:24:18.280
But um

02:24:23.280 --> 02:24:25.280
I'm your sister

02:24:26.280 --> 02:24:27.280
Well

02:24:27.280 --> 02:24:30.280
I do admit that it's very sweet

02:24:30.280 --> 02:24:33.280
That you admitted to me being your crush

02:24:33.280 --> 02:24:35.280
You know it's kind of wholesome in a way

02:24:35.280 --> 02:24:37.280
I'll give you a little smooch for that

02:24:40.280 --> 02:24:42.280
You look really good

02:24:45.280 --> 02:24:47.280
Good luck getting that all off

02:24:47.280 --> 02:24:49.280
I actually tattooed it to your face

02:24:49.280 --> 02:24:51.280
So I guess you're permanently gorgeous

02:24:55.280 --> 02:24:57.280
So

02:25:06.280 --> 02:25:08.280
The plot twist of the century

02:25:10.280 --> 02:25:12.280
Yeah, it's permanent

02:25:13.280 --> 02:25:14.280
It's permanent

02:25:15.280 --> 02:25:17.280
Hold on, I have an idea

02:25:19.280 --> 02:25:21.280
Hold on, I have an idea

02:25:21.280 --> 02:25:23.280
Nobody move

02:25:23.280 --> 02:25:25.280
Nobody do anything

02:25:25.280 --> 02:25:27.280
Frick

02:25:27.280 --> 02:25:29.280
Where is it?

02:25:32.280 --> 02:25:34.280
Where is it?

02:25:45.280 --> 02:25:47.280
Where is it?

02:25:47.280 --> 02:25:49.280
Where is it?

02:25:54.280 --> 02:25:57.280
Oh, I found it

02:25:59.280 --> 02:26:01.280
Hold on, hold on, hold on

02:26:04.280 --> 02:26:06.280
Please hold, please hold

02:26:06.280 --> 02:26:08.280
Please hold

02:26:08.280 --> 02:26:10.280
Please hold

02:26:12.280 --> 02:26:14.280
Please hold

02:26:24.280 --> 02:26:26.280
I kind of wish I found this earlier

02:26:26.280 --> 02:26:28.280
Because that would be funny if I just had this already

02:26:45.280 --> 02:26:47.280
Wow

02:26:47.280 --> 02:26:49.280
Oh

02:26:49.280 --> 02:26:51.280
Uh

02:26:54.280 --> 02:26:56.280
Uh

02:27:01.280 --> 02:27:03.280
Where are the toggles on this?

02:27:04.280 --> 02:27:06.280
Are there any toggles?

02:27:11.280 --> 02:27:13.280
I don't think there is

02:27:15.280 --> 02:27:17.280
Hold on, let me throw this away real quick

02:27:23.280 --> 02:27:25.280
Hold on

02:27:28.280 --> 02:27:30.280
And I'm not giving myself a base chat

02:27:36.280 --> 02:27:38.280
Sorry, it was going under my clothes

02:27:41.280 --> 02:27:43.280
There's like something you can do

02:27:43.280 --> 02:27:45.280
There's like more you can do

02:27:48.280 --> 02:27:50.280
I don't know why the toggles aren't working

02:27:50.280 --> 02:27:52.280
Is it over here?

02:27:53.280 --> 02:27:55.280
Nope

02:27:58.280 --> 02:28:01.280
What if I, what if I, let me go into the file

02:28:12.280 --> 02:28:14.280
I look like I'm getting tattooed

02:28:16.280 --> 02:28:18.280
No, it isn't supposed to be like this

02:28:19.280 --> 02:28:21.280
I'm the one who tattooed

02:28:21.280 --> 02:28:23.280
Let me give myself a cool face chat

02:28:24.280 --> 02:28:26.280
Let me give myself a beard

02:28:27.280 --> 02:28:29.280
That would be a fun ASMR stream

02:28:29.280 --> 02:28:31.280
You're tattooing me

02:28:31.280 --> 02:28:33.280
And I'm like an annoying client

02:28:35.280 --> 02:28:37.280
There's a way that I can like tattoo

02:28:37.280 --> 02:28:39.280
Oh, she on my chest

02:28:39.280 --> 02:28:41.280
So I can't figure out how to do it

02:28:41.280 --> 02:28:43.280
Hold on, let me see

02:28:52.280 --> 02:28:54.280
What if I load

02:28:57.280 --> 02:28:59.280
What are the hotkeys for this?

02:28:59.280 --> 02:29:01.280
I wish I would let you see the hotkeys

02:29:09.280 --> 02:29:11.280
What's it called?

02:29:11.280 --> 02:29:14.280
The live 2D assets you load in

02:29:16.280 --> 02:29:19.280
Alt F4, do you think I'm an idiot bro?

02:29:19.280 --> 02:29:21.280
Ow, I just like hurt my nose

02:29:23.280 --> 02:29:25.280
Yeah, you're being welded

02:29:27.280 --> 02:29:29.280
I'm tattooing some makeup on my face

02:29:30.280 --> 02:29:32.280
There are people who actually, what is happening

02:29:32.280 --> 02:29:34.280
There are people that tattoo stuff

02:29:39.280 --> 02:29:42.280
What if I just go through all the letters

02:29:43.280 --> 02:29:45.280
I will find these toggles

02:29:45.280 --> 02:29:47.280
As if it's the last thing I do

02:29:57.280 --> 02:29:59.280
Okay, they don't want to work

02:29:59.280 --> 02:30:01.280
Maybe I loaded it in wrong

02:30:01.280 --> 02:30:03.280
What if I load this as a model

02:30:04.280 --> 02:30:06.280
No, that wouldn't make any sense

02:30:06.280 --> 02:30:08.280
Did I put this on the wrong folder?

02:30:12.280 --> 02:30:14.280
Oh, if you haven't noticed, it's the end of the ASMR

02:30:30.280 --> 02:30:32.280
Demos

02:30:33.280 --> 02:30:37.280
I can have Drake or no regrets

02:30:37.280 --> 02:30:39.280
tattooed on me

02:30:40.280 --> 02:30:42.280
So I can't figure out how to do it

02:30:45.280 --> 02:30:47.280
Customize

02:30:48.280 --> 02:30:51.280
Kevin makes such great assets

02:30:59.280 --> 02:31:01.280
I wish I would

02:31:03.280 --> 02:31:05.280
It's like not showing, whatever I give up

02:31:05.280 --> 02:31:08.280
But you get the idea, you get the meme, you get the joke

02:31:10.280 --> 02:31:13.280
Property of Madame Sheevee in my bag

02:31:14.280 --> 02:31:16.280
Yeah, it was better, it was better

02:31:17.280 --> 02:31:20.280
I would give you a tramp stamp that says

02:31:20.280 --> 02:31:22.280
Omega

02:31:22.280 --> 02:31:24.280
And I'll get one on my front

02:31:25.280 --> 02:31:27.280
Where a boom tattoo that says Alpha

02:31:28.280 --> 02:31:30.280
Never mind

02:31:30.280 --> 02:31:32.280
I'm on YouTube

02:31:40.280 --> 02:31:43.280
Did you guys like the ASMR?

02:31:45.280 --> 02:31:47.280
Did you like it?

02:31:47.280 --> 02:31:49.280
Did you like the ASMR?

02:31:50.280 --> 02:31:52.280
Did you like my AC ambiance?

02:31:53.280 --> 02:31:55.280
Did you like my outfit?

02:32:06.280 --> 02:32:08.280
I realize I'm very thick

02:32:09.280 --> 02:32:12.280
No, ignore that my outfit is over my normal outfit

02:32:14.280 --> 02:32:16.280
What happens if I

02:32:35.280 --> 02:32:38.280
Let me just go back down

02:32:39.280 --> 02:32:41.280
No

02:32:45.280 --> 02:32:47.280
I like that my neck stayed in place

02:32:50.280 --> 02:32:52.280
That's because

02:32:52.280 --> 02:32:55.280
I usually load in my head as a model

02:32:55.280 --> 02:32:57.280
But this time

02:32:58.280 --> 02:33:00.280
I just

02:33:01.280 --> 02:33:05.280
Loaded in my normal self and just made my top transparent

02:33:09.280 --> 02:33:11.280
I

02:33:16.280 --> 02:33:18.280
Normally

02:33:20.280 --> 02:33:23.280
I just do this and I slap that on

02:33:28.280 --> 02:33:30.280
Hey look, it's me and the

02:33:30.280 --> 02:33:32.280
It's me and Bethany

02:33:32.280 --> 02:33:34.280
Hello

02:33:34.280 --> 02:33:36.280
Hi

02:33:36.280 --> 02:33:40.280
She looks like a little parrot I can put on my shoulders

02:33:41.280 --> 02:33:43.280
Shebethany?

02:33:44.280 --> 02:33:46.280
Sorry, I threw Shebethany away

02:33:52.280 --> 02:33:55.280
Erm, what's the shibbity?

02:33:55.280 --> 02:33:57.280
Erm, what's the shibbity?

02:33:57.280 --> 02:34:00.280
The actual shibbity? Is that Bethany?

02:34:00.280 --> 02:34:02.280
Shibbity

02:34:07.280 --> 02:34:11.280
Oh, I still haven't finished my immortal now that I think of it

02:34:11.280 --> 02:34:16.280
We have to finish it, we have the last, like, I think, 15 chapters to do

02:34:16.280 --> 02:34:22.280
And then Shebethany will disappear into the ether until I find another fanfiction

02:34:23.280 --> 02:34:25.280
I have to go pack

02:34:31.280 --> 02:34:34.280
I'm glad you guys liked ASMR

02:34:37.280 --> 02:34:41.280
The fanfic? No, Twilight's not a fanfic, that's a book

02:34:49.280 --> 02:34:52.280
But yes, I'm glad you guys enjoyed

02:34:53.280 --> 02:34:57.280
No, you're thinking of Fifty Shades, love, you're thinking of Fifty Shades

02:35:07.280 --> 02:35:11.280
Ugh, I guess I'll be all dick, okay, so I gotta go

02:35:12.280 --> 02:35:15.280
I gotta go pack and I have to go call my mom

02:35:20.280 --> 02:35:23.280
This is the part where I leave you guys

02:35:23.280 --> 02:35:25.280
Oh, this is hard

02:35:28.280 --> 02:35:31.280
I'm not gonna, hold on, let me switch to my normal mic

02:35:31.280 --> 02:35:33.280
Let me switch

02:35:36.280 --> 02:35:38.280
Okay

02:36:02.280 --> 02:36:04.280
Hi

02:36:07.280 --> 02:36:09.280
Sorry

02:36:12.280 --> 02:36:14.280
Is it too loud?

02:36:22.280 --> 02:36:24.280
Is it too loud?

02:36:25.280 --> 02:36:28.280
Okay, I was like, I haven't changed anything

02:36:31.280 --> 02:36:35.280
Yeah, it's louder because it's my normal mic

02:36:36.280 --> 02:36:39.280
I shouldn't have done that mic warning, I'm sorry

02:36:45.280 --> 02:36:49.280
I just turned this off, why is it still going?

02:36:49.280 --> 02:36:51.280
I don't know how this still picks up

02:36:54.280 --> 02:36:58.280
I turned the power off and OBS still picks it up

02:36:59.280 --> 02:37:03.280
So yeah, so I'll be gone, I don't know why I'm like tilted

02:37:03.280 --> 02:37:05.280
Why am I tilted?

02:37:07.280 --> 02:37:12.280
You spin me right around, baby, right around

02:37:12.280 --> 02:37:15.280
Like a good baby, right around, round, round

02:37:30.280 --> 02:37:32.280
But

02:37:33.280 --> 02:37:36.280
So yeah, I'll be gone for a little bit

02:37:39.280 --> 02:37:43.280
Hope you don't miss me too much, because I know I'll miss you guys a lot

02:37:51.280 --> 02:37:54.280
It's gonna be really hard to be gone

02:37:54.280 --> 02:37:57.280
Again, I'm gonna try to be super active on socials

02:37:57.280 --> 02:37:59.280
And

02:38:02.280 --> 02:38:05.280
I'm really bummed out right now

02:38:06.280 --> 02:38:10.280
Because you guys know I wanted to stream for you all the time

02:38:10.280 --> 02:38:14.280
It's hard not to be there

02:38:22.280 --> 02:38:26.280
My tears don't fall down my face anymore, I don't know why they broke

02:38:32.280 --> 02:38:34.280
But I love you guys a lot

02:38:34.280 --> 02:38:42.280
You know that it's gonna be super hard for me to be away from you

02:38:42.280 --> 02:38:45.280
And I never can ever do

02:38:45.280 --> 02:38:48.280
Oh yeah, people, it's been a month, it's been a month

02:38:48.280 --> 02:38:51.280
Guys, it's been a month for members

02:38:52.280 --> 02:38:58.280
Take care of yourselves, I'm leaving

02:38:58.280 --> 02:39:00.280
I'm leaving the girls in charge

02:39:00.280 --> 02:39:02.280
So behave

02:39:05.280 --> 02:39:08.280
I was about to read Dono's, but thank you for yelling at me

02:39:10.280 --> 02:39:12.280
I'm just saying, just saying

02:39:12.280 --> 02:39:14.280
I don't miss you guys

02:39:15.280 --> 02:39:18.280
Yeah, I can't believe it's already been a month

02:39:18.280 --> 02:39:21.280
Wait, 20 more subs until 10k, you're joking

02:39:22.280 --> 02:39:25.280
Sorry, I'm shrinking because I'm trying to look at my sub count

02:39:25.280 --> 02:39:27.280
I can't even find it

02:39:27.280 --> 02:39:29.280
It doesn't matter

02:39:31.280 --> 02:39:38.280
But I can't believe we already achieved these numbers in such a short amount of time

02:39:38.280 --> 02:39:43.280
As you guys know, it was my goal and my debut to hit 10k

02:39:43.280 --> 02:39:45.280
And we're so close

02:39:45.280 --> 02:39:47.280
And I just want to say thank you

02:39:47.280 --> 02:39:49.280
You guys are wonderful

02:39:49.280 --> 02:39:52.280
Thank you for renewing your memberships for the next month

02:39:52.280 --> 02:39:57.280
I'm happy that I'm worthy enough for you to still give me your money and support me

02:39:59.280 --> 02:40:01.280
But...

02:40:02.280 --> 02:40:04.280
Yeah, I just...

02:40:06.280 --> 02:40:08.280
A bit loud, turn down your damn headphones, bro

02:40:08.280 --> 02:40:11.280
I switched them out from my 3D oh my

02:40:11.280 --> 02:40:14.280
I literally just have no words besides

02:40:14.280 --> 02:40:19.280
I just have the feeling of thankfulness and gratefulness and affection

02:40:20.280 --> 02:40:22.280
It's crazy

02:40:23.280 --> 02:40:25.280
Congrats on nearly getting 10k, thank you

02:40:26.280 --> 02:40:29.280
But yeah, thank you members for renewing

02:40:32.280 --> 02:40:34.280
I can't wait to come back

02:40:34.280 --> 02:40:36.280
And...

02:40:37.280 --> 02:40:42.280
I can't wait to come back and do a fun member stream for you guys

02:40:42.280 --> 02:40:45.280
I think, yeah, we're gonna watch Salt Burn together

02:40:46.280 --> 02:40:49.280
I was gonna do a karaoke, but I technically already did a karaoke

02:40:49.280 --> 02:40:54.280
And that's up on the channel, so I'm like, I'll plan something a little bit better next time

02:40:54.280 --> 02:40:57.280
Instead of that weird spare of the moment thing

02:41:01.280 --> 02:41:03.280
Yeah, I'll miss you guys

02:41:06.280 --> 02:41:10.280
Yes, the armpit pic for 10k is still the reward

02:41:10.280 --> 02:41:13.280
I have it on standby, ready to be released into the ether

02:41:13.280 --> 02:41:16.280
That is my alt account

02:41:22.280 --> 02:41:24.280
Oh my goodness

02:41:25.280 --> 02:41:27.280
Let me look at the doughnose

02:41:36.280 --> 02:41:38.280
Oh my god

02:41:52.280 --> 02:41:56.280
Alright, thank you for the $50 tip Ms. Morgan

02:41:56.280 --> 02:41:59.280
The stream has meant more to me than I can properly describe

02:41:59.280 --> 02:42:03.280
Being trans, I've often mourned the childhood I never got to have

02:42:03.280 --> 02:42:07.280
This has let me experience a part of that childhood that I never thought I'd get to have

02:42:07.280 --> 02:42:09.280
Thank you big sis, anytime

02:42:09.280 --> 02:42:16.280
It's like, I'm an only child, so I never had anybody teach me to do makeup or do makeup on me

02:42:16.280 --> 02:42:19.280
So I kind of wanted to share that moment with you

02:42:19.280 --> 02:42:23.280
We both have an experience that we really never had before

02:42:23.280 --> 02:42:27.280
I'm happy you enjoyed it, thank you so much for your support

02:42:28.280 --> 02:42:32.280
Yeah, I know when you grow up a certain way

02:42:32.280 --> 02:42:37.280
And you realize you don't have the same experiences that the average person may have

02:42:37.280 --> 02:42:43.280
It's very bitter, but then it's better sweet because then you can always experience what's down the line

02:42:43.280 --> 02:42:46.280
It takes a little bit more time, but you get there

02:42:48.280 --> 02:42:50.280
Alright

02:42:50.280 --> 02:42:53.280
Let me see, is there anything else?

02:42:53.280 --> 02:42:55.280
Nope, I think that was it

02:42:56.280 --> 02:42:59.280
And $5 from a super chat, let me see where that went

02:42:59.280 --> 02:43:01.280
Where'd that super chat go?

02:43:02.280 --> 02:43:05.280
What are you, thank you Falling Floor

02:43:05.280 --> 02:43:07.280
What are you doing step sister?

02:43:10.280 --> 02:43:14.280
I'm putting makeup on ya, so I'll make you my bitch

02:43:19.280 --> 02:43:21.280
Did your mom not teach you?

02:43:21.280 --> 02:43:23.280
No, not really

02:43:23.280 --> 02:43:25.280
My mom didn't want me to wear makeup

02:43:25.280 --> 02:43:27.280
I taught myself how to do makeup

02:43:27.280 --> 02:43:31.280
And again, makeup that my mom does is a lot different from the makeup that I did

02:43:31.280 --> 02:43:35.280
If you look through the years about how makeup has changed in the last few decades

02:43:35.280 --> 02:43:37.280
It's very significant, not really significant

02:43:37.280 --> 02:43:40.280
My mom just throw blue eyeshadow over her eyes in mascara

02:43:43.280 --> 02:43:45.280
What am I going to do in the evenings while you're gone?

02:43:45.280 --> 02:43:50.280
You can study your Bible, but you just can't finish the verse, that's what you can do

02:43:51.280 --> 02:43:55.280
I won't have Shebe to keep me company at work for the next week

02:43:55.280 --> 02:43:57.280
I know, and I won't have you

02:43:57.280 --> 02:43:58.280
What the fuck?

02:43:58.280 --> 02:44:01.280
Oh, it's me because I'm bouncing my leg because I'm anxious

02:44:01.280 --> 02:44:04.280
Because I don't want to leave, I don't want to end the stream

02:44:05.280 --> 02:44:08.280
Shebe's going hard into the fentanyl

02:44:08.280 --> 02:44:11.280
I honestly, I just wanted to do that because I just kind of wanted to pamper you

02:44:11.280 --> 02:44:17.280
And men don't usually get that opportunity to be pampered and kind of taken care of

02:44:17.280 --> 02:44:22.280
And I can tell that a lot of you took a lot from this, from the skincare portion

02:44:22.280 --> 02:44:26.280
And honestly, in my opinion, I think men should be able to wear makeup

02:44:26.280 --> 02:44:30.280
Not in a huge way how women wear it

02:44:30.280 --> 02:44:35.280
But you should be able to wear makeup in terms of like, oh, maybe you want to contour your jaw

02:44:35.280 --> 02:44:39.280
Or maybe you want to conceal some zits

02:44:39.280 --> 02:44:42.280
I feel like that should be more normalized

02:44:42.280 --> 02:44:45.280
I thought I was a cat, no, it's me bouncing my leg

02:44:45.280 --> 02:44:50.280
But yeah, I just wanted to pamper you and remind you that you're loved and I care for you

02:44:50.280 --> 02:44:54.280
And then I'll brush your hair, I'll make your skin nice

02:44:54.280 --> 02:44:57.280
And I'll do your makeup and I'll give you kisses

02:45:01.280 --> 02:45:03.280
200 plus people quite a lot of people don't really brush your hair

02:45:05.280 --> 02:45:12.280
I just, like for me personally, I'm a very, whoa

02:45:13.280 --> 02:45:18.280
I got really confused because I thought that was USD

02:45:18.280 --> 02:45:20.280
And I was gonna piss myself

02:45:22.280 --> 02:45:25.280
Thank you so much for the donovie for Supa

02:45:25.280 --> 02:45:28.280
Wow, that's so kind of you

02:45:30.280 --> 02:45:33.280
Yeah, I was literally like, what?

02:45:33.280 --> 02:45:37.280
And I was gonna, I was literally, yeah, everybody else

02:45:38.280 --> 02:45:41.280
I'm happy, I'm happy I'm not the only one

02:45:42.280 --> 02:45:46.280
I have to, I don't know how much that is in USD

02:45:48.280 --> 02:45:50.280
But thank you

02:45:51.280 --> 02:45:54.280
If it was 100K or otherwise

02:45:59.280 --> 02:46:01.280
Yeah, $6, yes

02:46:01.280 --> 02:46:03.280
What, what is that from?

02:46:03.280 --> 02:46:05.280
I don't know, what, um

02:46:08.280 --> 02:46:10.280
What is that from?

02:46:10.280 --> 02:46:12.280
Indonesia, oh, okay, got you, got you

02:46:14.280 --> 02:46:18.280
Now a rich chatter should drop to 100K for the bit

02:46:18.280 --> 02:46:21.280
I don't, I don't think I have anybody like that watching me

02:46:23.280 --> 02:46:25.280
I don't, I don't think so

02:46:27.280 --> 02:46:34.280
But just some random Arabian prince is like, yes, I like, I like this bunny

02:46:35.280 --> 02:46:36.280
Here you are

02:46:41.280 --> 02:46:45.280
Bill Gates, just like Tim Cook, just here you go

02:46:46.280 --> 02:46:49.280
The one oil baron, his biding his time

02:46:49.280 --> 02:46:53.280
Waiting for my birthday, Jonathan to occur

02:46:53.280 --> 02:46:56.280
The bunny is delectable to 100K

02:46:58.280 --> 02:47:00.280
100,000, yes

02:47:04.280 --> 02:47:05.280
Hey, madame

02:47:05.280 --> 02:47:08.280
No, for you guys are fine, don't worry about that

02:47:08.280 --> 02:47:13.280
Giving, giving me money wouldn't, um, make me treat you any different

02:47:13.280 --> 02:47:15.280
How small or large

02:47:16.280 --> 02:47:19.280
Um, quick, everybody find a lottery ticket

02:47:21.280 --> 02:47:24.280
It's okay, I'm poor too, we can be poor together

02:47:24.280 --> 02:47:25.280
Yep

02:47:26.280 --> 02:47:28.280
Um, what was I gonna say?

02:47:29.280 --> 02:47:35.280
But, uh, I just, a part of me is just really, doesn't want to leave

02:47:35.280 --> 02:47:39.280
I really feel like you guys, and you can make fun of me, I don't care

02:47:39.280 --> 02:47:42.280
But I feel like you guys are gonna leave me and be like, oh, she's gone for a week

02:47:42.280 --> 02:47:48.280
Let me go find another oh she, um, let me go find another streamer

02:47:48.280 --> 02:47:56.280
And you just never come back to me and you never, you never want to, you never want anything to do with me again

02:47:57.280 --> 02:48:00.280
And that scares me, I guess I have a fear of abandonment

02:48:01.280 --> 02:48:05.280
Um, and I know some of you guys do too, cause you guys are scared that I'm leaving

02:48:05.280 --> 02:48:15.280
But just know that I'm also scared to be leaving cause I'm, I'm the same exact way that I'm bouncing my legs so hard

02:48:15.280 --> 02:48:21.280
I need to calm down, um, I need to just like, I'm just like, let me just stim, let me just stim

02:48:23.280 --> 02:48:28.280
I am, I am needy streamer, that is, that is indeed me

02:48:31.280 --> 02:48:41.280
But, I have to remind myself and I look at your comments and I look at your, your sweet tweets at me

02:48:41.280 --> 02:48:50.280
Um, and I just remind myself, no, that's not true, don't let the breadworm, the breadworms, the brainworms, win

02:48:50.280 --> 02:48:53.280
They, they love me as much as I care for them

02:48:53.280 --> 02:48:57.280
I remember, I was scrolling on Twitter and I saw a tweet

02:48:57.280 --> 02:49:00.280
And it's one of those like, from one of those stupid accounts, a tweet romance stuff

02:49:00.280 --> 02:49:12.280
But it said, I know a love like the one I want exists because I have that love within myself

02:49:12.280 --> 02:49:14.280
And I want to give it to someone, something like that

02:49:14.280 --> 02:49:24.280
And I think, I think that kind of just, it's you guys, like I know you guys give me the same energy back

02:49:25.280 --> 02:49:28.280
You match my freak, so to speak

02:49:30.280 --> 02:49:35.280
Um, so I'm just very thankful for you

02:49:35.280 --> 02:49:42.280
Uh, please don't forget me or be sad in my absence, I'll still be around, I'll try to do a Twitter space

02:49:42.280 --> 02:49:45.280
I'll have short settles go up

02:49:45.280 --> 02:49:51.280
Again, I am profusely apologizing because I did not have time with everything that I was doing

02:49:51.280 --> 02:49:57.280
To, um, finish the ASMR video, but I will do it immediately when I come back home

02:49:57.280 --> 02:50:05.280
Um, I have some fun stuff planned when I come back, some script writing, Zatsu

02:50:05.280 --> 02:50:08.280
Upon my return, we can write a script together

02:50:11.280 --> 02:50:15.280
Uh, obviously I want to play Elden Ring, going to watch Saltburn

02:50:15.280 --> 02:50:23.280
Uh, have some collabs, I've been touching base with a lot of really sweet, amazing girls, VTubers

02:50:23.280 --> 02:50:27.280
And I can't wait to spend time with them, oh they're very sweet

02:50:27.280 --> 02:50:32.280
And I appreciate them for giving me a chance to just like hang out and be cool

02:50:36.280 --> 02:50:42.280
I'll leave you guys voice messages, I'll leave like little voice messages on my ultimate Twitter

02:50:46.280 --> 02:50:49.280
I wish I could give you guys a hug

02:50:49.280 --> 02:50:52.280
Like I think cause I need a hug right now

02:50:52.280 --> 02:50:56.280
I'm so scared to leave, I don't want to leave

02:50:59.280 --> 02:51:03.280
Mama raised proper men, we are here to stay, I hope so

02:51:03.280 --> 02:51:09.280
It's gonna be so hard to enjoy myself because I realize I enjoy myself the most when I'm with you

02:51:11.280 --> 02:51:14.280
And I'm trying not to cry but that's the truth

02:51:15.280 --> 02:51:21.280
Oh my big baby, you've had me, I've been had, I'm a big baby and you know wipe my eyes

02:51:28.280 --> 02:51:31.280
But yes, I'm giving hugs right back

02:51:31.280 --> 02:51:34.280
Hug the mic, hug the mic, hug the mic

02:51:39.280 --> 02:51:40.280
Yeah

02:51:45.280 --> 02:51:49.280
You guys know I'm a softy but like I think that's what makes me a good dom

02:51:49.280 --> 02:51:58.280
Because I'll be soft, I'll be sweet and isn't it so much better when you have someone like me just like tearing your ass up, you know

02:51:58.280 --> 02:52:04.280
When you have someone like me to put you in your place and make you beg and bark on your knees

02:52:04.280 --> 02:52:10.280
Use you as a foot stool, hit you with my crop, oh that reminds me

02:52:10.280 --> 02:52:13.280
Something came in today, I want to show you guys, hold on

02:52:16.280 --> 02:52:17.280
Oh

02:52:22.280 --> 02:52:28.280
My neighbor was like, oh do you want me to start bringing up your mail for you because I see you get mail a lot

02:52:28.280 --> 02:52:33.280
And I'm like, no you don't have to at all, oh crap my cat's vet just called me

02:52:33.280 --> 02:52:37.280
I hope they leave a message, it's probably with Reina's blood work

02:52:38.280 --> 02:52:39.280
Um

02:52:40.280 --> 02:52:44.280
Oh gosh I hope it's not like bad news because I'm gonna lose it if it's bad news man

02:52:44.280 --> 02:52:46.280
I don't want to deal with that right now

02:52:47.280 --> 02:52:50.280
But yeah I told my neighbor, please don't get my stuff

02:52:50.280 --> 02:52:54.280
Why is this in a plastic bag? This is just a big ziploc bag

02:52:55.280 --> 02:52:57.280
I don't know how I feel about that

02:52:58.280 --> 02:52:59.280
It's fine

02:53:01.280 --> 02:53:03.280
Can you guess what this item is?

02:53:07.280 --> 02:53:10.280
Mmm it smells interesting

02:53:10.280 --> 02:53:13.280
Hold on there's like zip ties around it, I need scissors

02:53:13.280 --> 02:53:15.280
Do I have a knife over here?

02:53:15.280 --> 02:53:18.280
I swear to God I thought I had a knife over here

02:53:18.280 --> 02:53:23.280
I might not be able to do $10,000 but I could do $10, you're fine

02:53:23.280 --> 02:53:25.280
Thank you for your first soup, you're so sweet

02:53:26.280 --> 02:53:30.280
You take, yeah my mom will be watching over my cats

02:53:30.280 --> 02:53:36.280
And I also have the, what's it called, the cat cam

02:53:37.280 --> 02:53:42.280
So I'll be able to see them and I can shoot treats at them

02:53:43.280 --> 02:53:45.280
Sorry I'm looking for scissors

02:53:45.280 --> 02:53:46.280
Scissors

02:53:57.280 --> 02:53:59.280
Zip ties

02:54:00.280 --> 02:54:04.280
I will leave, I need some more, I'm gonna miss you so much

02:54:05.280 --> 02:54:07.280
You jump into the freaking bridge

02:54:08.280 --> 02:54:09.280
Alright

02:54:10.280 --> 02:54:18.280
How am I gonna use this? This isn't, I feel like I'm gonna hurt myself with it

02:54:20.280 --> 02:54:26.280
Like what do I do with this? I should have never accepted this gift

02:54:27.280 --> 02:54:31.280
I already hit all my toys, the shoes finally came in today

02:54:32.280 --> 02:54:34.280
It's not shabari, can you hear it?

02:54:34.280 --> 02:54:39.280
Be careful with the whip, that's right it's a whip

02:54:40.280 --> 02:54:45.280
Can I, oh, can you hear that?

02:54:54.280 --> 02:54:55.280
Can you hear it?

02:54:56.280 --> 02:55:00.280
Can you hear the whip? This thing is so big, I have a giant ass whip

02:55:05.280 --> 02:55:06.280
Oh

02:55:16.280 --> 02:55:20.280
It is a four or five foot long bull whip?

02:55:21.280 --> 02:55:31.280
Um, yeah, no, I'm good, don't worry, I'm not, I'm not doing anything

02:55:32.280 --> 02:55:35.280
But yeah, I have a whip now, I feel like fucking catwoman

02:55:36.280 --> 02:55:39.280
I wanna do a catwoman cosplay, Michelle Pfeiffer style

02:55:40.280 --> 02:55:43.280
I can just twirl this around me like a motherfucker

02:55:44.280 --> 02:55:49.280
Oh, thank you so much for the soupa

02:55:51.280 --> 02:55:53.280
I thought that was $500,000

02:55:56.280 --> 02:56:01.280
That just keeps freaking me out, cause I like, I pause and I'm like, okay, wait, no, I'm fine

02:56:03.280 --> 02:56:07.280
I was just like, uh, that was just terrified me

02:56:08.280 --> 02:56:13.280
I would have been like, please, please don't give me that much money

02:56:14.280 --> 02:56:16.280
Thank you, thank you so much of you

02:56:30.280 --> 02:56:33.280
So kind, I just hit my hands on my microphone

02:56:33.280 --> 02:56:36.280
But yeah, I got a whip now, I don't know where I'm gonna put this

02:56:37.280 --> 02:56:39.280
Where do I put this big ass whip?

02:56:39.280 --> 02:56:40.280
Boomi, you want it?

02:56:42.280 --> 02:56:43.280
Take a little sniff

02:56:44.280 --> 02:56:45.280
Boomi's sniffing

02:56:49.280 --> 02:56:52.280
Oh my god, I hope my mom doesn't fight into this big ass whip

02:56:59.280 --> 02:57:00.280
I don't know

02:57:03.280 --> 02:57:05.280
I think soupas can only go to $500

02:57:07.280 --> 02:57:14.280
Keep in mind, if you do a soupa, most of it, most, most of it, I'm suddenly Australian, um, most

02:57:16.280 --> 02:57:20.280
It'll go to YouTube, so Streamlabs is the best way to go

02:57:25.280 --> 02:57:28.280
Say it's for horseback riding and rodeo lessons

02:57:28.280 --> 02:57:31.280
No, my parents know what I do for a living, guys

02:57:31.280 --> 02:57:35.280
They know what I do, they know that I'm a lewd voice actress

02:57:43.280 --> 02:57:46.280
No way, you're just telling me that now, I thought that's usually, I thought that was common knowledge

02:57:48.280 --> 02:57:52.280
Do you like the whip, madam? Please be careful, the cats, don't you want it? Yes I do

02:57:53.280 --> 02:57:56.280
Yes I do, thank you Taft Potential, I do like it a lot

02:57:56.280 --> 02:58:03.280
Wait, I can't even see, if anybody did don't know normally, I can't even see Streamlabs because I don't have it open

02:58:09.280 --> 02:58:10.280
Yeah

02:58:15.280 --> 02:58:16.280
Yippee

02:58:20.280 --> 02:58:21.280
YouTube takes 30%

02:58:22.280 --> 02:58:24.280
Cat toy, cat toy, do it

02:58:24.280 --> 02:58:26.280
What do you think, Reyna? What do you think about this?

02:58:27.280 --> 02:58:30.280
Ooh, Reyna's excited, Reyna wants to play with the whip

02:58:32.280 --> 02:58:37.280
Ooh, you like that Reyna? She's like, she's like trying to grab it with her paw

02:58:39.280 --> 02:58:42.280
I don't know if you could hear her, she's on like the plastic bag it came in

02:58:43.280 --> 02:58:47.280
No, Reyna let it go, Reyna let it go, I have to clip their claws after this

02:58:47.280 --> 02:58:50.280
Reyna let go, I shouldn't have taught you to play with that

02:58:50.280 --> 02:58:55.280
Alright, I wonder what this would feel like to hit someone with a bend over

02:58:55.280 --> 02:58:59.280
Okay, where do I put this? Where do I hide with it? I don't know where to hide with it

02:59:21.280 --> 02:59:25.280
Okay, I think I hid it

02:59:26.280 --> 02:59:30.280
I shoved it in a place in my closet, I hope my mom doesn't notice

02:59:37.280 --> 02:59:41.280
Oh, I don't want to leave, I don't want to leave, I don't want to leave, I just want to be with you

02:59:44.280 --> 02:59:45.280
But I have to go pack

02:59:46.280 --> 02:59:48.280
I'm 10K? Are you 10K?

02:59:50.280 --> 02:59:53.280
No way, we hit 10K

03:00:02.280 --> 03:00:06.280
Oh my god, it's okay, we're gonna get called, but we hit 10K

03:00:08.280 --> 03:00:12.280
Holy shit, we hit 10K

03:00:12.280 --> 03:00:15.280
Oh my god

03:00:16.280 --> 03:00:20.280
I can't believe we hit 10K live on stream, that's insane

03:00:20.280 --> 03:00:23.280
How did my thing go up to me?

03:00:25.280 --> 03:00:26.280
What the heck?

03:00:28.280 --> 03:00:30.280
10K, let's go!

03:00:31.280 --> 03:00:34.280
There's 10K harlots that love me

03:00:36.280 --> 03:00:41.280
Oh, I'm so proud of us, again, it's 10K of you

03:00:41.280 --> 03:00:45.280
You did this, you wonderful harlots, you...

03:00:47.280 --> 03:00:49.280
Now you get an armpit picture

03:00:50.280 --> 03:00:52.280
Are you happy? You get to see my armpit

03:00:57.280 --> 03:00:59.280
You get to see my armpit

03:01:00.280 --> 03:01:02.280
Armpit, armpit

03:01:07.280 --> 03:01:11.280
Okay, I made a promise that if we hit 10K, which I didn't think would be this soon

03:01:12.280 --> 03:01:17.280
I'd post a picture of my armpit mole, because I have an armpit beauty mark

03:01:23.280 --> 03:01:26.280
If you're new here, by the way, I'm brown

03:01:27.280 --> 03:01:32.280
So my armpit will not be a beautiful alabaster porcelain white

03:01:32.280 --> 03:01:34.280
I am a brown girl, I am tan

03:01:35.280 --> 03:01:38.280
So you'll get a nice tan pit

03:01:42.280 --> 03:01:46.280
Armpits are like the five hot as well, as you're not really getting my armpit

03:01:46.280 --> 03:01:48.280
Like it was just the mole, I said

03:01:48.280 --> 03:01:51.280
I'm kind of shy to show you guys my armpit

03:01:51.280 --> 03:01:56.280
Because armpits are not as pretty as they are drawn

03:01:56.280 --> 03:01:59.280
I do not have a vagina looking armpit

03:02:06.280 --> 03:02:08.280
All armpits are beautiful

03:02:10.280 --> 03:02:20.280
Because like, you know how they draw them looking like succulent, wet, smooth as a fucking slug

03:02:22.280 --> 03:02:26.280
Like, I almost had a turtle for some reason

03:02:29.280 --> 03:02:33.280
Guys, I shave my armpits, I have like little hair stubble

03:02:35.280 --> 03:02:39.280
And when you're brown, your pits are more melanated

03:02:41.280 --> 03:02:43.280
So I got some melanated pits

03:02:46.280 --> 03:02:49.280
I think in the picture you also get a little bit of my hair

03:02:49.280 --> 03:02:56.280
But again, I only reveal, I don't normally, like, I'm a VTuber first and foremost, everyone

03:02:56.280 --> 03:03:02.280
I only do like hand cams and thigh cams, foot cams, what have you

03:03:04.280 --> 03:03:10.280
And like little cosplays that show off my RTX form

03:03:10.280 --> 03:03:15.280
Only for milestones, it is not on a daily basis, by the way

03:03:15.280 --> 03:03:23.280
I'm not a flush tuber, I'm not, as they say, a twitch thought that's come to ruin VTuber

03:03:23.280 --> 03:03:29.280
That is not me, I only do it because I like to give you guys little treats and you ask for it

03:03:29.280 --> 03:03:35.280
So, yeah, you're never seeing my face, I am sheebie

03:03:35.280 --> 03:03:43.280
Soon enough, my tanness will reflect it in my 2D form, my true form if you will

03:03:44.280 --> 03:03:48.280
So, yeah, 100k, we get the other pit, well, wouldn't it be 20k?

03:03:48.280 --> 03:03:54.280
20k, I don't have anything on my other pit though, so, I don't know

03:03:57.280 --> 03:03:58.280
My emotes

03:04:00.280 --> 03:04:02.280
Yeah, I know, I need to figure that out

03:04:04.280 --> 03:04:10.280
When we get eyeball pics, you'll never get an eyeball pic because that is a part of my face

03:04:10.280 --> 03:04:11.280
I'm sorry

03:04:17.280 --> 03:04:19.280
What was the next milestone?

03:04:20.280 --> 03:04:23.280
I'll probably say, I don't know

03:04:26.280 --> 03:04:29.280
Yay, new members, neck reveal, guys, I'm not

03:04:31.280 --> 03:04:38.280
You're never seeing my eyes, you're never seeing my mouth, you're never seeing my ear

03:04:41.280 --> 03:04:45.280
Next milestone, 100k

03:04:49.280 --> 03:04:53.280
Neck reveal is wild, it will just be just brown skin

03:04:53.280 --> 03:05:01.280
Oh, thank you, LGF, thank you for the 50 gifted

03:05:01.280 --> 03:05:07.280
Absolutely insane, amazing way to celebrate getting 10k

03:05:08.280 --> 03:05:12.280
Okay, I'll say it, I guess you are my little pog champ

03:05:17.280 --> 03:05:19.280
Okay, like, brown woman she means

03:05:26.280 --> 03:05:31.280
Everybody's like, yay, more, more gifted

03:05:31.280 --> 03:05:33.280
Thank you so much

03:05:33.280 --> 03:05:34.280
LGF

03:05:37.280 --> 03:05:40.280
I feel so bad for my lurkers that like, post because they're like, did I win?

03:05:40.280 --> 03:05:48.280
And then, but the gotcha, the gotcha did not grant them what they wanted

03:05:54.280 --> 03:05:56.280
I'm just here long for the ride

03:05:57.280 --> 03:05:59.280
One the gotcha

03:06:10.280 --> 03:06:14.280
Remember, if you guys want to, yeah, it's 50, it's going to take a bit

03:06:14.280 --> 03:06:22.280
If you guys still want to, if you want to watch Salt Burn with me

03:06:22.280 --> 03:06:27.280
When we do the watch along, when I come back, you can always upgrade to the member tier

03:06:27.280 --> 03:06:30.280
Because this is just emotes, and you have to be

03:06:30.280 --> 03:06:38.280
Hell yeah, Castle Hellford, a dollar, thank you, so sweet

03:06:38.280 --> 03:06:43.280
I'll heart that for you, what a sweet little castle

03:06:53.280 --> 03:06:57.280
I can do a lot with one doll, I can buy myself some candy

03:06:57.280 --> 03:07:00.280
I can get myself an espresso shot, probably not

03:07:04.280 --> 03:07:09.280
Looking forward to the bathtub seat and salt, me too, me too

03:07:11.280 --> 03:07:16.280
If you haven't seen Salt Burn, do not look anything up, that is an order

03:07:17.280 --> 03:07:21.280
You're so beautiful and gorgeous, oh thank you, oh stop it

03:07:21.280 --> 03:07:24.280
You're going to make me blush, oh goodness

03:07:30.280 --> 03:07:35.280
Good, good, good, you better be scared, you better be scared

03:07:37.280 --> 03:07:43.280
No spoilers, no spoilers

03:07:44.280 --> 03:07:47.280
I'm debating whether or not to fart in the mic

03:07:49.280 --> 03:07:52.280
A little cheeky brat for 10k

03:07:54.280 --> 03:07:57.280
Are you going to watch the boys finale, oh shit

03:07:57.280 --> 03:08:01.280
Oh no, I won't be able to watch the boys finale

03:08:03.280 --> 03:08:06.280
Oh wait, no, I don't leave till the late

03:08:07.280 --> 03:08:11.280
I don't leave till the, I'm not going to say when

03:08:13.280 --> 03:08:19.280
Nobody charge my flight please, I should, maybe if I can

03:08:20.280 --> 03:08:24.280
Watch it on the flight, oh that's true, I can watch it on the flight

03:08:24.280 --> 03:08:26.280
Yeah I'll do, well no, I'll just be screaming the entire time

03:08:26.280 --> 03:08:30.280
What if somebody gets like, is like some really gory shit

03:08:30.280 --> 03:08:33.280
Or like sexual shit is happening in the finale

03:08:33.280 --> 03:08:36.280
And I'm just sitting there watching it with some poor normal person

03:08:36.280 --> 03:08:38.280
A sweet little lady looking over to my iPad

03:08:38.280 --> 03:08:41.280
And somebody's getting like finger bangs

03:08:42.280 --> 03:08:43.280
Or whatever

03:08:50.280 --> 03:08:56.280
Wait, wait, are you a, are you a, are you a, a role player?

03:08:56.280 --> 03:08:59.280
I think role player chatters are some of my favorite chatters

03:08:59.280 --> 03:09:02.280
Okay the person who proposed role plays this Friday

03:09:02.280 --> 03:09:04.280
Now I got some of the role plays of Sans

03:09:04.280 --> 03:09:06.280
Now I can just follow

03:09:08.280 --> 03:09:10.280
That's how I'll read your comments from now on

03:09:12.280 --> 03:09:14.280
Sitting next to a nun

03:09:14.280 --> 03:09:16.280
I'm sitting next to a nun and we're doing it

03:09:16.280 --> 03:09:18.280
On the plane in front of everyone

03:09:31.280 --> 03:09:33.280
I can't go that deep

03:09:33.280 --> 03:09:37.280
Mile Halakai Club with the sweet old nun that'll be sitting next to me

03:09:38.280 --> 03:09:42.280
I saw an old guy watching straight up corn on his phone in an aisle seat

03:09:42.280 --> 03:09:44.280
Geez

03:09:44.280 --> 03:09:46.280
Oh my god

03:09:46.280 --> 03:09:48.280
I, I forget where I'm sitting on the right

03:09:48.280 --> 03:09:52.280
All I know is that my plane ride back is gonna be shitty

03:09:52.280 --> 03:09:55.280
Because I'm in the middle of my plane ride back

03:09:55.280 --> 03:09:58.280
On my plane ride there, I'm in the window

03:09:58.280 --> 03:10:00.280
To the walls

03:10:02.280 --> 03:10:06.280
I thought it was a mistake to eat snacks while watching the web viewer tech night episode

03:10:08.280 --> 03:10:10.280
Oh that was fun

03:10:11.280 --> 03:10:13.280
Yes it is, I should be Undertale

03:10:13.280 --> 03:10:16.280
I wanted to play Undertale at one point because I think the voice acting would be fun

03:10:16.280 --> 03:10:23.280
But I would not want to play the whole game

03:10:23.280 --> 03:10:25.280
And it's really hard to get through

03:10:25.280 --> 03:10:28.280
Because I would just want to do Papyrus' voice

03:10:28.280 --> 03:10:30.280
Make him sound like Skeletor like everybody else does

03:10:32.280 --> 03:10:34.280
You've solved my puzzle

03:10:37.280 --> 03:10:40.280
You're still on season 3? Hurry up

03:10:46.280 --> 03:10:48.280
By the power of puzzles

03:10:51.280 --> 03:10:54.280
Wonderland's dungeon has definitely funded my tech night with all the equipment

03:10:54.280 --> 03:10:57.280
You think I'm funded by a man who runs prisons

03:10:57.280 --> 03:11:00.280
And is a little white nationalist

03:11:00.280 --> 03:11:06.280
It's rage inducing

03:11:06.280 --> 03:11:08.280
I never thought it was rage inducing

03:11:16.280 --> 03:11:18.280
Great comment, thank you

03:11:19.280 --> 03:11:24.280
Literally my OG name before I got the daddy sign on Bob in it from Bob from Temmie

03:11:24.280 --> 03:11:30.280
I still, I know I'm mentally ill because sometimes I'll just go

03:11:30.280 --> 03:11:32.280
Hi I'm Temmie, just like randomly

03:11:33.280 --> 03:11:36.280
Hi, hi I'm Temmie

03:11:36.280 --> 03:11:38.280
Hi, I'm Temmie

03:11:40.280 --> 03:11:42.280
I just do that

03:11:42.280 --> 03:11:44.280
I just do that, normally

03:11:47.280 --> 03:11:49.280
Hi, I'm Chibi

03:11:55.280 --> 03:11:58.280
I'm literally I'm Sans and I'm Temmie

03:11:58.280 --> 03:12:00.280
Hi, I'm Temmie

03:12:00.280 --> 03:12:02.280
Temmie Flakes

03:12:02.280 --> 03:12:04.280
Temmie Flakes

03:12:06.280 --> 03:12:08.280
Hoives

03:12:08.280 --> 03:12:11.280
And her thoughts just working out whenever they feel like it

03:12:11.280 --> 03:12:14.280
Because sometimes I'm the type of person where if I see like a word

03:12:14.280 --> 03:12:16.280
And it reminds me of like a quote

03:12:16.280 --> 03:12:18.280
I'm gonna say the quote out loud

03:12:19.280 --> 03:12:22.280
And I'm just impulsive like that

03:12:22.280 --> 03:12:24.280
I'm glad I'm not the only one from what the chat is saying

03:12:27.280 --> 03:12:31.280
My undyne impression will just sound like a really hot tomboy

03:12:32.280 --> 03:12:35.280
And then like my alphys impression will be like

03:12:36.280 --> 03:12:38.280
Hi Undyne

03:12:38.280 --> 03:12:42.280
I was wondering if you want to go back to my laboratory and watch anime

03:12:43.280 --> 03:12:45.280
Well I don't know, should we alphys?

03:12:45.280 --> 03:12:47.280
I gotta kill these guys over here

03:12:49.280 --> 03:12:51.280
Something like that, I don't know

03:12:53.280 --> 03:12:54.280
Um

03:13:00.280 --> 03:13:03.280
Sometimes when I think of a move in a word I just automatically start doing it

03:13:03.280 --> 03:13:04.280
Yeah, same

03:13:04.280 --> 03:13:06.280
We love the gay fish

03:13:08.280 --> 03:13:10.280
That's the voice you gave Dusa, you're right

03:13:10.280 --> 03:13:12.280
I did give Dusa that voice

03:13:13.280 --> 03:13:15.280
Can we get a so sorry impression?

03:13:15.280 --> 03:13:17.280
I don't know what that references to

03:13:17.280 --> 03:13:20.280
Is that a character within Undertale?

03:13:22.280 --> 03:13:25.280
I played Deltarune as well

03:13:25.280 --> 03:13:27.280
And I loved, I really like Deltarune

03:13:27.280 --> 03:13:32.280
I have to fin, I think they, did they finish the like newer episodes of Deltarune?

03:13:32.280 --> 03:13:33.280
I don't know

03:13:33.280 --> 03:13:35.280
And he put my 3D away, it's like in my face

03:13:35.280 --> 03:13:37.280
I can barely see the screen

03:13:38.280 --> 03:13:40.280
State fast, rip fast

03:13:40.280 --> 03:13:42.280
I can't stay there

03:13:43.280 --> 03:13:45.280
Toriel British

03:13:45.280 --> 03:13:47.280
Does everybody make Toriel British?

03:13:47.280 --> 03:13:49.280
I probably would then

03:13:50.280 --> 03:13:54.280
Um, I baked you a butterscotch cake

03:13:54.280 --> 03:13:55.280
Cake?

03:13:55.280 --> 03:13:58.280
I baked you, I baked you a butterscotch pie

03:13:58.280 --> 03:14:00.280
I hope you think it would be really delightful

03:14:01.280 --> 03:14:03.280
I worked really hard on it, you know

03:14:03.280 --> 03:14:06.280
Um, I think you belong here, just fine

03:14:10.280 --> 03:14:12.280
Chapter 2's out, okay

03:14:12.280 --> 03:14:14.280
I never, I didn't read, I didn't read

03:14:14.280 --> 03:14:16.280
I didn't do Chapter 2 then

03:14:17.280 --> 03:14:19.280
Great CC voice

03:14:19.280 --> 03:14:20.280
Has the Brit not bad

03:14:20.280 --> 03:14:22.280
You should go see, I think I retweeted it

03:14:22.280 --> 03:14:25.280
It's not an actual short, but I kind of want to upload it as an actual short

03:14:25.280 --> 03:14:27.280
And give credit to the person who made it

03:14:27.280 --> 03:14:29.280
I did a whole British bit

03:14:29.280 --> 03:14:30.280
Um, with my Goexla

03:14:30.280 --> 03:14:32.280
I can do a British accent very well

03:14:32.280 --> 03:14:36.280
Cause I really like period, um, TV shows and films

03:14:37.280 --> 03:14:40.280
And I would just watch British stuff with my mom all the time

03:14:40.280 --> 03:14:43.280
Um, I also used to watch a lot of Love Island, so

03:14:44.280 --> 03:14:46.280
Butterscotch cinnamon pie, it was good

03:14:47.280 --> 03:14:51.280
I remember one of the characters in the game, Sundar Plain and Sundare

03:14:52.280 --> 03:14:55.280
That's right, yeah, the one that like kind of like blushes at you

03:14:55.280 --> 03:14:59.280
And she's like, I love that the characters in that game are just great

03:15:00.280 --> 03:15:02.280
British Papa

03:15:02.280 --> 03:15:04.280
Can you do a British chop though?

03:15:06.280 --> 03:15:11.280
I can't really do, like, particular

03:15:13.280 --> 03:15:17.280
Uh, what's it called? Regional accents that well?

03:15:19.280 --> 03:15:23.280
It's like, I can be either really posh or really Londoner

03:15:24.280 --> 03:15:26.280
Like, oh, bro, you want a tussle, yeah?

03:15:26.280 --> 03:15:29.280
Well, you know, I see a fit bird out there

03:15:29.280 --> 03:15:32.280
And I said, you know, I'm a bagger, I'm a pull this fit bird

03:15:32.280 --> 03:15:34.280
And then you swooped in, bro

03:15:34.280 --> 03:15:36.280
And you just took a rifle under me

03:15:36.280 --> 03:15:39.280
And I fucking hate you for that, you're fucking bloody wanker for that

03:15:39.280 --> 03:15:40.280
That's all I'm gonna say, bro

03:15:40.280 --> 03:15:42.280
That's all I'm gonna say

03:15:44.280 --> 03:15:47.280
Went Scottish there, I did, sometimes I'll go Scottish

03:15:48.280 --> 03:15:51.280
The way I go Scottish is I'll either say

03:15:52.280 --> 03:15:56.280
If you had the chance to change your fate, would ya?

03:15:56.280 --> 03:15:59.280
Or what are you doing in my swamp?

03:15:59.280 --> 03:16:02.280
Or I'll say, um, reeflings

03:16:04.280 --> 03:16:06.280
I just channel scrawny

03:16:07.280 --> 03:16:09.280
Yeah, I just sound like a roadman, yeah

03:16:09.280 --> 03:16:10.280
Yeah

03:16:13.280 --> 03:16:15.280
Okay, what did you say?

03:16:20.280 --> 03:16:22.280
Am I being hit on by, uh

03:16:24.280 --> 03:16:25.280
Skull in forever

03:16:27.280 --> 03:16:30.280
I can't do, would ya know

03:16:30.280 --> 03:16:33.280
I can't do a Australian accent, though

03:16:33.280 --> 03:16:36.280
I can't really do it, no, oh, no

03:16:36.280 --> 03:16:39.280
I need to like listen to Aimee more

03:16:39.280 --> 03:16:43.280
Absolutely, sometimes like during our Left 4 Dead 2 collab

03:16:43.280 --> 03:16:45.280
With Aimee and Reia in Azura

03:16:45.280 --> 03:16:47.280
I literally just sat there and I would be quiet

03:16:47.280 --> 03:16:50.280
Because I wanted to listen to Aimee talk so I could emulate her voice

03:16:51.280 --> 03:16:54.280
One time recently I was in the shower

03:16:54.280 --> 03:16:58.280
And I was listening to, uh, I think like a Neander's clip

03:16:58.280 --> 03:17:02.280
And I would just, I would, I'm a freak, guys

03:17:02.280 --> 03:17:05.280
I was just sitting, standing in the shower, brushing out my hair

03:17:05.280 --> 03:17:06.280
You know, doing what I'm doing

03:17:06.280 --> 03:17:08.280
And then Neander's would say something

03:17:08.280 --> 03:17:11.280
And I just would try to say in the same exact voice

03:17:18.280 --> 03:17:20.280
Uh, hi everyone

03:17:20.280 --> 03:17:21.280
Hi, hi

03:17:21.280 --> 03:17:25.280
I, um, I can't, she like kinda goes to the front of it

03:17:25.280 --> 03:17:27.280
And it's kind of in the back of it

03:17:27.280 --> 03:17:29.280
I can't even do it right now

03:17:30.280 --> 03:17:32.280
And I've tried to do like Shia Lily's voice

03:17:43.280 --> 03:17:46.280
Shimi, I don't really want you to leave, but no, you need to go pack, fuck, you're right

03:17:50.280 --> 03:17:52.280
Listen to laser beam for this truly an accident

03:17:53.280 --> 03:17:56.280
Come on, come on, yeah

03:17:56.280 --> 03:17:59.280
I need to, I'm trying to work on it

03:17:59.280 --> 03:18:02.280
Yeah, I just really want to be able to voice act and do cool impressions

03:18:02.280 --> 03:18:05.280
Like fuckin' Elizabeth Bloodflame

03:18:07.280 --> 03:18:10.280
Uh, I really, if I listen to, if you give me a voice

03:18:10.280 --> 03:18:13.280
Like I figured out I can do Kiara's voice

03:18:13.280 --> 03:18:15.280
And I can do Mori Kaliope's voice

03:18:15.280 --> 03:18:17.280
So that's interesting

03:18:18.280 --> 03:18:20.280
Now you're not free, you're just dedicated to VA

03:18:20.280 --> 03:18:22.280
Also I knew a girl who stayed out two hours in the shower

03:18:22.280 --> 03:18:24.280
Cause she has a bathtub markers to meet art in the shower

03:18:24.280 --> 03:18:26.280
That's actually kinda cool

03:18:26.280 --> 03:18:28.280
I didn't know that was a thing

03:18:34.280 --> 03:18:38.280
Yeah, she's a fucking god for that

03:18:40.280 --> 03:18:43.280
Um, for her, for her impressions

03:18:44.280 --> 03:18:47.280
Uh, yeah, I was trying to do, like I was trying to figure out how to do

03:18:47.280 --> 03:18:51.280
I think I can do Doki Bird's voice too

03:18:51.280 --> 03:18:54.280
I realized one time when I was watching her a lot

03:18:54.280 --> 03:18:58.280
Uh, and one of my streams, this is one of my, my appeal

03:18:58.280 --> 03:19:01.280
I realized I was accidentally talking like her

03:19:01.280 --> 03:19:05.280
Because I just, I have echolalia, so like when I listen to something

03:19:05.280 --> 03:19:08.280
Enough, I just start to mimic it and replicate it

03:19:08.280 --> 03:19:11.280
And I was like doing her laugh

03:19:11.280 --> 03:19:15.280
And I was like, I can't do it right now

03:19:15.280 --> 03:19:17.280
I don't have the laugh down

03:19:17.280 --> 03:19:21.280
Again, I have to listen to a voice and repeat it constantly

03:19:21.280 --> 03:19:26.280
And I don't, I don't listen to the VTubers enough

03:19:26.280 --> 03:19:29.280
That I want to learn imitations of, that I can just do it on command

03:19:29.280 --> 03:19:32.280
I literally have to listen to a voice clip and then I can get into it

03:19:33.280 --> 03:19:35.280
I could probably do Kobo's voice, actually

03:19:35.280 --> 03:19:37.280
I'm not gonna, cause I can go that high

03:19:37.280 --> 03:19:43.280
Like I can do, I can do Fuwawa Mokoko

03:19:43.280 --> 03:19:47.280
Cause I can go that high

03:19:47.280 --> 03:19:51.280
I, I realized I can do higher voices better than I can do lower voices

03:19:51.280 --> 03:19:55.280
Which doesn't make any sense, cause my voice is naturally in a lower register

03:19:55.280 --> 03:19:57.280
So I don't, I don't get that

03:19:59.280 --> 03:20:00.280
Why?

03:20:00.280 --> 03:20:02.280
I literally made a friend crap himself

03:20:02.280 --> 03:20:05.280
I dressed up as a slender man and then he was, what?

03:20:07.280 --> 03:20:09.280
Off topic, but okay

03:20:10.280 --> 03:20:12.280
It's a lack of an Adam's apple

03:20:18.280 --> 03:20:21.280
Yes, I 100% have more control of my head voice in Volsetto

03:20:21.280 --> 03:20:23.280
Yes, I definitely do

03:20:38.280 --> 03:20:43.280
Cause they're like, they, like, so there's a lot of VTubers that are like, breathe out a lot when they're talking

03:20:43.280 --> 03:20:48.280
They go, like I noticed when I was trying to mimic Neanna's voice

03:20:48.280 --> 03:20:52.280
She talks out and she breathes out like this

03:20:52.280 --> 03:20:59.280
And when she, she gets a little bit high cause she has a naturally soft and higher voice

03:20:59.280 --> 03:21:01.280
But I can't, but she like, breathes out

03:21:02.280 --> 03:21:05.280
At least you don't practice your belting

03:21:05.280 --> 03:21:07.280
Yeah, I don't think my neighbors would like that

03:21:10.280 --> 03:21:17.280
Sounds like a mix of mocha kawawa, yeah, right, cause I need to listen to them to really like, again, to be able to do it

03:21:19.280 --> 03:21:23.280
And like, and Shy Lily's is in the back of the throat

03:21:24.280 --> 03:21:26.280
Hi, I can't, I can't even fucking do it

03:21:26.280 --> 03:21:31.280
I like how she speaks like that, that's me, I know, right?

03:21:31.280 --> 03:21:36.280
I love, VTubers have such interesting voices because a lot of them are voice actors themselves

03:21:36.280 --> 03:21:41.280
And, you know, they became popular because they have very distinct, unique voices

03:21:41.280 --> 03:21:46.280
For example, Doki Bird has such a distinct and unique laugh and that's just something

03:21:46.280 --> 03:21:51.280
One of the things that made her so lovable was her such, she has such a cute laugh

03:21:52.280 --> 03:22:00.280
And so it's so fun to mimic VTubers voices because they're all so very different and like, very unique

03:22:00.280 --> 03:22:09.280
Me, I just, I kind of, again, I've gotten compared to like, like a deeper Maury, Calliope before

03:22:11.280 --> 03:22:16.280
And like some other VTubers because I speak in a kind of a deeper register

03:22:17.280 --> 03:22:21.280
Got a Master of Gen Maids, I can do Icy

03:22:22.280 --> 03:22:27.280
Hi everybody, it's Icy Snowpaws

03:22:27.280 --> 03:22:33.280
Today we're going to be doing some Guild Wars

03:22:34.280 --> 03:22:36.280
I love my Dadas

03:22:36.280 --> 03:22:53.280
My Icy is good, she has a little bit of vibration and then you just have to do some like a European accent

03:22:54.280 --> 03:23:08.280
Um, and I don't know if I can do Amy's voice

03:23:08.280 --> 03:23:12.280
I have to listen to Amy's voice to do it

03:23:12.280 --> 03:23:16.280
I'm trying to think of like, I'm trying to repeat her voice in my head right now

03:23:17.280 --> 03:23:20.280
I can go as high as Amy

03:23:20.280 --> 03:23:24.280
And then I can be a Zara Dule

03:23:24.280 --> 03:23:30.280
I'm working on a Zara's voice because she has a breathy voice

03:23:30.280 --> 03:23:34.280
But I can't seem to get her Lisp down because she has a Lisp, but I don't notice it

03:23:34.280 --> 03:23:40.280
And then Zara was just like, no, I do have a Lisp, I'm like, I don't pick up on it, so I can't do that

03:23:40.280 --> 03:23:48.280
Um, it's a decent, I mean, yeah, no, I can 100% get Amy's voice

03:23:48.280 --> 03:23:51.280
I will just need to practice

03:23:51.280 --> 03:23:55.280
Um, Skinwalker skills

03:23:55.280 --> 03:24:00.280
Is Vela actually, no, actually we're all strongies personas

03:24:00.280 --> 03:24:02.280
I'm strongy

03:24:02.280 --> 03:24:06.280
Are you fucking kidding me right now?

03:24:06.280 --> 03:24:11.280
I can't even, she has a little bit

03:24:11.280 --> 03:24:17.280
So, so, so, so I was wondering if, no, I have to listen to her voice

03:24:17.280 --> 03:24:20.280
Are you squiddin' me right now?

03:24:20.280 --> 03:24:22.280
Are you squiddin' me right now?

03:24:22.280 --> 03:24:25.280
Yeah, that sounded like I see, it's because I still have Icy's voice in my head

03:24:28.280 --> 03:24:31.280
Yeah, I'm trying to get Mercy's laugh down

03:24:32.280 --> 03:24:34.280
I can't even do it

03:24:34.280 --> 03:24:43.280
So, so, so, so, I have to like, I don't even, because Mercy's voice is similar to mine in terms of like

03:24:45.280 --> 03:24:48.280
She's like a little bit higher than mine

03:24:50.280 --> 03:24:52.280
Yeah, Mercy's laugh is in the chest

03:25:01.280 --> 03:25:06.280
Yeah

03:25:10.280 --> 03:25:13.280
What took you so long to come back, granddaughter?

03:25:15.280 --> 03:25:17.280
Bye, thank you

03:25:18.280 --> 03:25:20.280
Mercy's fill-

03:25:20.280 --> 03:25:22.280
Yeah

03:25:28.280 --> 03:25:33.280
Imagine a whole VTuber company that's just in person with multiple personas

03:25:33.280 --> 03:25:40.280
I am, I think there's actually a company that's a VTuber like that

03:25:40.280 --> 03:25:49.280
I know like, Alias has her two little like ghosty friends that she does voices for, which is very impressive

03:25:49.280 --> 03:25:53.280
And then I believe that Clotho, who just debuted in

03:25:58.280 --> 03:26:02.280
Mythos is actually technically playing three people

03:26:04.280 --> 03:26:06.280
So it's pretty cool

03:26:07.280 --> 03:26:09.280
Collabs would be tricky

03:26:13.280 --> 03:26:16.280
I think there's a running joint, the floor, because everybody in his closet

03:26:16.280 --> 03:26:18.280
That is funny

03:26:19.280 --> 03:26:21.280
Oh

03:26:25.280 --> 03:26:29.280
I'll leave in three minutes, I'll leave in three minutes, let me find someone to read

03:26:32.280 --> 03:26:34.280
Oh, Strony is playing, yeah, I'll read Strony

03:26:35.280 --> 03:26:43.280
She's playing supermarket simulator, I hope she isn't fucking hiking up her prices or something

03:26:44.280 --> 03:26:46.280
I didn't know

03:26:47.280 --> 03:26:53.280
Strony is very impressed with how far along my Scottish accent has come since I first spoke to her

03:26:58.280 --> 03:27:01.280
Now because I since I talk to her more often

03:27:03.280 --> 03:27:08.280
Well, my neck isn't quite on my body, hold on, let me lean back when I lean forward

03:27:17.280 --> 03:27:23.280
Wait, is Strony not streaming? Was that, what the heck?

03:27:28.280 --> 03:27:30.280
Am I tripping?

03:27:31.280 --> 03:27:35.280
Was that just like an old thing? Was that old?

03:27:37.280 --> 03:27:40.280
Strony rated me, you're right, I don't know why

03:27:42.280 --> 03:27:44.280
I don't know why that just

03:27:47.280 --> 03:27:49.280
What the hell?

03:27:50.280 --> 03:27:53.280
It didn't reflect on my screen that she stopped streaming

03:27:54.280 --> 03:27:57.280
I'm so, I'm tired, leave me alone, leave me alone

03:27:58.280 --> 03:28:01.280
See, that's why I put that there, that's why I put that thing there

03:28:04.280 --> 03:28:06.280
Oh wait, Phoenix, I didn't see that, $20 tip

03:28:06.280 --> 03:28:11.280
Check her out, CB, not just on the 10k, but on all the other dreams that are and will be coming true

03:28:11.280 --> 03:28:14.280
Oh, thank you, Phoenix

03:28:15.280 --> 03:28:17.280
So kind, thank you so much

03:28:18.280 --> 03:28:22.280
It's because I don't have the donor alerts on because I'm in my ASMR scene

03:28:25.280 --> 03:28:28.280
Let's see, let's see there

03:28:29.280 --> 03:28:34.280
Let me find a real Bonnie Lassie for ya

03:28:35.280 --> 03:28:37.280
Let's go outside the Corpo

03:28:38.280 --> 03:28:40.280
Let's find someone real cute
