Already

66
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:09,200
I literally just saw her I came from the fricking I just came from communication and Amy is

67
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:17,840
Standing over the body of rain. Holy crap. Yeah, holy crap. No, don't even fucking lie. I'm sorry, but you're into

I'm the only heroes for this fucking shadow role player

73
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,200
Yeah, okay. The already guilty thing I have to admit is that I like shadow, but I didn't

74
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,520
I didn't do this. I promise

75
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,480
Does straw knee set you up

76
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,040
Amy are you joking? I was literally at the gas canister

77
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:03,040
Watching you as you go to pull the lever and then fucking snipe rain in half her fucking torso is like left behind

78
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,120
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry

79
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,960
I don't know who to vote for

80
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,760
Open up my stream right now. I'm not being

81
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,720
Shadowed the hedgehog streamer

82
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,480
I'm not being gaslit by a freaking sonic the hedgehog

Johnny immediately just be like fuck you now. That's not true

84
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,480
I'm sorry, but you seem you seem suspicious

85
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,520
I would never

86
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,760
If if if it's not I me I'm voting for straw knee next round

87
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,800
Why am I getting in trouble? Obviously, it's gonna be because you're so passionate

88
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:59,840
You're actually welcome for doing half of the work now. You you all go find the other imposter while you're at it. I'll do it

89
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,920
I'll try my best

90
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,560

Oh

99
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:13,520
When straw knee talks like that, I know it's fucking her. That's her tail. That's her tail when she's so

100
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,840
Defensive so fast that is straw knees tell

101
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,520
Yes

102
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,160
I can't believe that this happened. I am so hurt

103
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,480
What kind of defenses I didn't do it

104
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:01,120
And it like oh we got to play prop hunt on gmod at some point

I'll I'll be a good little girl. I'll do my tests

108
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,200
I keep having to do the same shit

109
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,400
Why it's like the easiest person

110
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,880
I don't I don't like this guys. I don't like this

111
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,880
No, I don't like this bros

112
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:15,680
Someone's gonna kill me and stab me in the back and I'm just gonna just take it from behind and

113
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,520
Oh fuck

114
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,240
Cool, okay, we're fine. We're good. We're chilling. Um

115
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:39,920
I'll be fine. Hopefully I'm I'm pretty nervous. I'm not good at a mogul. How do I port?

116
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,440
What the hell

117
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,240
I was doing I was doing

118
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,800
A conversation

119
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,760
I was do let me talk

120
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:02,480
I found the body let the rabbit speak. Um, so I was doing electrical. It's coming from electrical and I walked up

121
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:08,000
Down, uh, actually, I don't know where the hell the map works. Hold on. Let me let me look at the map

122
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,880
I walked up near and in between reactor and security

123
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,680
So, okay, and then I found Imi's body

124
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,880
I am I am going to vouch for rea and pink because she was near me all the way

125
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,720
She did I saw her go in the opposite direction. So I think I think rea is fine

126
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,840
Yeah, yeah, he coughed on me

127
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:36,880
Stroni rea and mercer vouching for one another. She is claiming she saw it. So azura mimosa and rea

128
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,120
Yeah, what do you what do you guys have to say for yourselves?

129
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,440
I have to say something

130
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,480
It was it was not me

131
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,640
How do we know it wasn't you

132
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,360
Because as straw me I was with straw me and then I went to security and I saw what happened

133
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,360
I didn't see who killed well. It was in between security

134
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,640
It was in between security and reactor

135
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,720
Now I did see rain. I did see rain and admin

136
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:11,760
So azura and mimosa are now the most likely suspects unless she be you're playing mind game

137
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:17,520
So I'm not I'm not she be are all sus now. Uh, unless ventilation was taken in electrical

138
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,760
I don't believe a word you say azura

139
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,720
I'm innocent because I was I was

140
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,280
I was literally sitting in the at the table. I was sitting at the table because I'm having audio issue

141
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,560
Okay

142
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,920
I don't know who to vote for then I'm gonna vote for mimosa just because I love

143
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,400
Wait, who is the person that said they walk to security?

144
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,120
Who is me I don't know who to vote for

145
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,560
Azura and mimosa have abstained for voting. How fucking curious

146
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,360
I don't recognize people's voices yet

147
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,520
So

148
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,480
Azura is the most fucking likely I'm keeping an eye on Azura

149
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,960
Staring at you

150
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,800
We're getting oh

151
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,520
Hold on a second

152
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
It's not me. I promise

153
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,560
Rain don't stab me in the back

154
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,160
It's not me. I promise. She casually walks by

155
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,280
Oh

156
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,720
Why do I feel like it was mercy

157
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,640
She well no mercy mercy just walk past me

158
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:56,880
Hey, what's up, uh rain walked by me and she said I'm not it. Don't worry. It's not me and we were alone

159
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,960
So she's I think she's good

160
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:11,440
Yes, it's what what other oh wait, they can't hear me. I walked away. I'm just gonna continue. Oh

161
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,320
Uh

162
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,280
I don't know which way to go. How do I play this game?

163
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,480
Please don't kill me strani

164
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,320
Wait a moment

165
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:41,520
I's mercy walked by me and disappeared into the nether. I do believe it might be her

166
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:54,000
I was alone with rain and reya and strani

167
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,200
I think mercy it's mercy

168
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,040
It's not I can't believe you would do such a thing to me

169
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,880
Is there I'm sorry

170
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,800
It would make sense why mercy would vote

171
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,480
I actually like

172
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:42,000
I probably could have killed I was actually aiming for rain, but I don't know how to

173
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:48,400
It's mercy walked right past me and I'm surprised you didn't kill me then because I was just like talking to myself like a weirdo

174
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,360
Not accepted

175
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,840
I'm red not blue goddamn

176
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,320
Jesus okay

177
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:14,880
I'm lying. I forgive you. I I can never be none. All right. They're all lying. Do my tasks and shake my ass. Let's do it

178
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,160
Please don't kill me. I'm I'm working hard

179
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,400
Oh, thank you reya that was nice. I appreciate that

180
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:39,120
She just jiggled her booty and walked away. Oh, okay. Um

181
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,840
Somebody shut the door

182
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,800
I don't think it was reya

183
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,800
Oh memosa

184
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,480
Okay, are you gonna kill me? No, no like this

185
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,360
Wait

186
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:11,120
Is in freaking electrical and who does stumble upon puri reya's dead body?

187
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,400
No

188
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,080
She's a victim

189
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,640
Eventually open the door because the door just got closed in my face me and um

190
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,760
The door is also closed on me the opens and then I mean ivy comes out and then

191
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,400
I go in at the back at the vent section and reya's sitting dead with her weak corpse

192
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,360
I mean

193
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,520
Did you tell me to kill myself? No

194
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,960
She just wanted to shake her ass

195
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,520
I was doing electricals

196
00:26:55,680 --> 00:27:00,400
Strani strani when you get like this strani when you get like this

197
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,280
I don't trust you

198
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,880
She's like breaking my microphone

199
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,920
I need to start strani down

200
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:28,320
She literally goes. I was an electrical. I tell you I find the dead body of reya an electrical

201
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,800
I'm abstaining. I'm abstaining

202
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,600
If it's i me then it might

203
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:51,520
Well, if it's i me it also might be mimosa because mimosa was cornering me and I saw them walking together

204
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,560
Probably by the table again

205
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,600
Excuse me

206
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:24,720
Oh my god is i me

207
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:36,560
It's strani it's strani it's strani hit the button hit the button it's strani

208
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,920
It's

209
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,880
Strani

210
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,960
I'm even kidding to play the game

211
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:05,600
No, when it goes oh when strani's and I know we impostor

212
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:15,360
Wait, no mercy mercy always votes for the person that accuses her when she's impostor

213
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:23,760
It's mercy. It's mercy. It's mercy. If you want to lose this crew me have fun, but I'm here at win and you guys are being

214
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,400
It's

215
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,200
I would love to

216
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,080
Right when I float away in space and it says strani was a weak crew me everyone turned to mercy and vote for her

217
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,160
Thank you very much

218
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,720
By mercy

219
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:12,080
I should have why didn't I go with my gut? Why didn't I go with my gut? I should have gone with my gut

220
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,480
I knew it. She did the same thing again that she does when she

221
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,080
Oh my god

222
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:31,440
It's because mercy will accuse someone and vote for somebody who is who is the impostor and accusing her when she's the impostor

223
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,560
And then strani gets so defensive

224
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,560
It's a weeping

225
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,800
I'm so upset

226
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,040
I'm so upset right now

227
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,760
Listen

228
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:15,760
I'm so mad right now. I'm so I'm so angry. I'm gonna sit in the corner and be upset

229
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,760
All right now

230
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,120
Why am I impostor again

231
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,120
Oh my god

232
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,840
Wait, what's going on?

233
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,680
You guys want to do a little buddy system? Hold on. Let's do a buddy. So who wants to be my buddy?

234
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,960
I don't believe in buddies

235
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,440
Okay, okay guys we got this we got this guys we got this

236
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
We're good

237
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,960
I think we're safe

238
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,200
I

239
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,360
Need to find somebody to chill with

240
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,480
What the hell are you guys doing over here?

241
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:30,320
Okay, all right, there's two there's too many witnesses

242
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,280
Hi me and hey, uh

243
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:45,680
This is this is suspicious. I don't like these two hanging out

244
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,040
You hear the game

245
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,560
Mercy mercy, I knew this one

246
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,160
Mercy

247
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,880
Are we alone?

248
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,800
Okay, okay, come here come come on the hallway

249
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,240
Wait, okay

250
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,280
Come over here mercy come over here

251
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,480
What are we what are we doing? We need to do a double

252
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,040
What's going on in here

253
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,920
Guys, I think mimosa is too timing all of us. I said she's impostor, but she's not what she is

254
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:33,760
I don't know but I'm really easily gaslit. So I'm I'm gonna believe

255
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,920
I think okay, I don't want to be with an impostor

256
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:49,440
I got it. You got it. We can do a double

257
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,400
Yes

258
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:56,880
I'm I'm thinking come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. I'm thinking

259
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,080
Amy and

260
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,280
Yeah

261
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Hi

262
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,520
You're gonna kill me

263
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,880
I'm not the impostor

264
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,240
I'm not the impostor

265
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,120
Oh, hey

266
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,760
Why

267
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,200
Where the heck is Azura where's Azura at

268
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,200
Where is Azura?

269
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,400
I haven't seen Azura

270
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:02,480
I'm like so confused. Oh, there you are. I was like, where's Azura?

271
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:14,960
He died only rain I found rain dead in the back of electrical nobody was nearby

272
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:21,760
Um, but I have a feeling it might be rea and azura because they like to sit with each other

273
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,160
I saw

274
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,360
In rea together. No, I saw I mean

275
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:37,200
So rea and I went together for a while and then I was to do tasks and then I was with azura and then she became

276
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,200
I walked in on us. Yeah, I was

277
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,040
I couldn't have vented from electrical to security

278
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:50,880
And mercy are very unlikely of had to do the tame in order to do electrical unless mercy vented from below

321
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,160
I walked away. I can't even say anything

322
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:24,080
I'm skipping my vote. I'm I can't I'm upstanding. I'm upstanding

323
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,960
I literally walked away not knowing where I was going

00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,680
Listen, if the imposter wins, you guys are gonna lose. Okay. All right, that's all I have to say

326
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,680
No, mercy mercy didn't know where she was going just like me. I heard her walk away and I was laughing about it

I'll vouch for you

332
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,560
Okay, I don't think it's strawney because she could have just maybe killed me

333
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,840
Um, she would have looped back around. I don't think it's amy

334
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,760
I mean, uh, it might be I think it is rain

335
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,040
I suck at this

336
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,800

I'm still I'm still doing this thing. Oh, okay. Uh, I think mercy is fine

339
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,520
It's definitely I feel like it's rain

340
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,760
Yeah, I'm trying to run to it

341
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,720
I'm guarding you. I mean I'm guarding you. I'm guarding you. Don't do it mercy

342
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:29,200
Oh, okay. I did it. I do proud of you. Good job. Good job. Good job. Good job. Really pop. You did it. You did it

343
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,720
Um, I don't know if I trust mercy. I don't know if I trust mercy. I don't know if I trust mercy

344
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,800
I definitely don't trust rain

345
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,600
Imi's good straw. He's good

346
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,440
It's not Imi

347
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,240
It's definitely rain. I'm voting for rain

348
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,280
Azura is gonna fucking I keep forgetting Azura is around

349
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:58,080
Azura kind of probably killed me right then. I might not be Azura, but it's definitely rain

350
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,760
How many do I have to do?

351
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:07,840
Okay, cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Uh, I think I'm gonna go stick to Imi

352
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,360
Where is Imi?

353
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,200
What on earth

354
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:26,880
Listen, I still think it's freaking I know it's not rain. It's you. It's you rain

355
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,920
It's rain

356
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:37,760
So mercy, I don't know where straw knee was straw knee. Uh, I saw her like a long time ago

357
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,120
But mercy was in the hallway next to admin

358
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:47,120
I had walked all the way from weapons through cafeteria and then found her body there

359
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:50,000
Where rea rea, where did you come from?

360
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:56,880
I went from so I went in the circle. I went from admin to down and then through I think it's

361
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,920
So, hold on. So you were the last one to see mercy?

362
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,720
Yeah, I was I think actually

363
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,280
Cackles you I'm voting rain because she's a sure yes

364
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,720
I'm voting rain

365
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,000
Listen, I'm pretty sure it's rea or she be then okay

366
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:21,600
I was shooting asteroids Azura. You saw me sit in there. You walked by she be sitting there

367
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:26,400
But it's either she be or rea because rea was the last to see

368
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:32,640
No, no, no, no, no, but but I was with you as solo in security. Yeah

369
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:38,880
Oh, I wasn't really dude. I was with you and Azura in security to rea, but listen. I thought it was imi

370
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,800
I think it might be

371
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,480
I don't think it's I I don't know anyone that I know it's imi is one of them

372
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:46,880
Yes, I

373
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,880
I we had every chance to kill me. We were alone so many times

374
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:52,320
Really?

375
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:55,520
And I didn't do it. We stood and talked. We had a lovely conversation

376
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,600
I watched her do the oxygen

377
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:07,360
I think she's grooming you I think it's Azura and rain

378
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:18,960
I did I did see you walk past me, but you could have looped back around you might have been waiting for your moment

379
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,600
That's impossible because I literally ran past

380
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,560
Uh rain and

381
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,640
I don't think it's

382
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:31,200
Okay, listen, I know it. I don't think it's Azura at all. I think it's imi and rea

383
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,920
Oh, shit. It doesn't matter rain get out of here

384
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:50,800
All right, all right, so uh, okay, then who's it gonna be who's gonna be amy amy amy amy amy

385
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:58,640
Uh, if they kill one of us that means we lose so we need to stick together

386
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:05,680
Uh, or we can hit the table oxygen depleted. It's Azura. It's Azura. It's Azura. It's Azura. It's Azura

387
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:09,120
It's Azura. I don't trust this. No, no, I can't

388
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,480
Oh, no, oh, no, I mean, no

389
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,320
If imy kills me, I'm gonna cry

390
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:24,080
I trust in you

391
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,280
It was rain so hard voting for her own

392
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:54,100
Dude, I was trying to help her so you guys wouldn't think it was her

393
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,400
Yeah

394
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:44,800
Honestly, yeah masterclass rain strat masterclass rain strat

395
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,560
Anyway, I'm so upset

396
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,080
It was it was a good strat it was a good strat

397
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,560
Do you want to take a little breaky poo we all can chat

398
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,680
So good

399
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:30,080
I have never felt so betrayed in my entire life

400
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:37,840
Get away from me. I mean don't look at me anymore. I trusted you

401
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,280
I'm so sorry. I mean when much she needed a little help

402
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,600
I

403
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,520
She stabbed me in the back when I was doing oh, too

404
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,440
I mean loves being bullied and teased guys she loves it. You see, you know

405
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,800
The long

406
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,600
What happened

407
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,760
Is someone echoing

408
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,560
Someone's game is echoing

409
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:56,640
That was pretty that was a good round I got a I got a hand to you guys for the strat I got a hand to you guys

410
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,400
It's pretty good. I'm upset, but it's whatever

411
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:12,800
Rae, I'm right next to you. So I think we're we're both doing the cow card. So we should be good

412
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,160
So did I it's fine

413
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:27,360
I I had a feeling they were gonna pull a double on us. I had a feeling the moment they walked in

414
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:35,440
I know yeah, we were both right on top of each other for that

415
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,520
I guess I could do tasks while I'm dead

416
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,680
I

417
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:57,760
Hi, hi, what's up?

418
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,760
I

419
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:24,880
She was standing right there, I walk into the card room. Oh no mercy and then mercy then reports

420
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,720
She was in shock

421
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:36,240
Oh my god, how would she possibly kill people I want nervous she saw me

422
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,280
This would be the fastest round ever

423
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,480
It's a self-report. Oh my gosh

424
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,440
I saw the bodies and started screaming

425
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:57,360
No

426
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:21,760
When that oxygen thing comes on, what do you did I look at the wrong part of the map for the oxygen because I was trying to turn it back on

427
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:27,440
Look at fucking do you hear Strani lying right now? Do you hear her pulling shit out of her ass?

428
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,560
I I cannot trust

429
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Strani ever again

430
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:49,680
I can never I don't know why any of you ever trust Strani. I've never trusted Strani

431
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:08,320
I was trying to do the oxygen and it wasn't working and I didn't know what I was doing

432
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,480
To say that I'm top left

433
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:25,840
I will choose who the imposter is

434
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,640
Okay, go for it

435
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,200
I was like

436
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:46,480
Me and reya we're just swiping our cards having a jolly good time and then these two come in

437
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,400
Literally and they've doubled us

438
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,960
Body

439
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,120
She was in so much shock

440
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,400
Oh god

441
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,640
I don't trust a word strani says

442

494
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:10,880
That'd be hilarious if you killed me azura is literally lingering outside because she's waiting for one of us to be alone

495
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,520
She can kill us

What oh azura it's azura

500
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:37,760
Dude, I think it's azura too. I saw her walking into electrical. I think it's azura and mercy

501
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:40,720
And I found a body. What the fuck?

502
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:46,320
What the fuck me and strongy are good. I was hanging out strongy looking at cameras

503
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:49,440
Azura was lurking around in camera

504
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:58,720
But then also mercy's someone to follow being creepy. Uh, I'm gonna vote for mercy because she don't trust how she's looking at me

505
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:12,800
Oh when you killed her

506
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:18,880
It's rain

507
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:26,800
But why where's the reasoning azura

508
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:32,080
I said it. I was literally with you guys in I was literally with you guys in security

509
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:34,640
I went to security with you guys and then I went up

510
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:38,560
I went and did my task and came back down and she said did she accuse me

511
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:41,440
Did she accuse me

512
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:47,040
All right, all right strongy stay with me strongy strongy strongy strongy come back

513
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:54,000
All right, trust any of you guys man. I'm sticking with you strongy. Uh, do I have anything to do it down here?

514
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,720

515
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:10,960
It's mercy and rain

516
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:15,760
They were gonna double kill they win if they do a double kill they win

517
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:22,400
Azura you have to listen to us

518
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:29,680
Okay, we're voting rain. We're voting rain. We're voting rain. We're voting rain

519
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:36,640
Because her and mercy almost doubled me and strongy. That's all i'm gonna say

520
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:41,920
Man, you guys were you guys were lining yourselves up to stab me in my butthole. I don't I don't believe you

01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,880
It's always the cute ones. It's always

611
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:02,320
Reya vented and killed me at bed bay

612
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:10,960
I was like, oh shit. Look strony. Strony. You said it was mercy. You said it was mercy

613
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:18,880
But you instantly went for me

614
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:22,640
It's because you said it was mercy

615
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:35,360

01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:51,360
I hate that I can't see anything

618
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:56,880
I'm waiting for someone to walk around me

619
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:08,960
All right, all right, we're good. We're golden. We're good. We're living like Larry. I don't see anybody

620
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:14,320
I'm a I'm a little nervous

621
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:19,280
I

622
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:21,440
Mercy are you gonna get me?

623
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:27,840
What are you doing? I'm just doing my tasks mercy

624
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:32,800
Oh

626
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:52,800

629
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:28,320
Oh my god, can we get an imposter, please?

Okay, okay, how do we can we exit the game how?

01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:29,760
That was my bad guys. I thought we were all here

643
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:37,280
Okay, who's next?

644
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:40,080

Is mimosa dead? Like what word word do mimosa go?

646
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:54,560
Bring her on the rose. Oh, okay. I thought she's just she's just quiet. Yeah

647
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:59,040
It was the other imposter. What are you hungry for?

648
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:01,280
You

Even better

652
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:09,520
What?

653
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:12,560
What?

654
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:18,400
Oh, no

655
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:22,160
All right, who is it mim's rain. I cannot believe you just did that

656
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:28,320
Okay, because we got to get mercy back in. Okay, mim's just I don't even know man. Okay

657
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Now it's mimosa

658
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:44,720
Is that how you pronounce it shabby shabby shabby shabby shibbers shibberton shibbillit shibbethany

659
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:55,600
I did it for us

660
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:03,360
All right, I'm gonna go get some water

661
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:09,280
I got it

662
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:11,280
Yeah

663
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:13,280
Thanks a lot. I like

664
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:17,280
I like how I know I make canik runs. She does like this in the lobby. I like how she does that

665
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:22,240
Game could make me and Mary play the imposter again for another flawless victory. That'd be great

666
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:27,600
You guys are really good imposter. I haven't gotten imposter once

667
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:30,560
I fucking love it

668
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:35,840
And when there's two of us together, I love going three two one

669
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:47,600
Anyways, my next goal is to follow someone just for fun. No

670
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:51,360
Why do you sound so far away?

671
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:55,600
Oh

672
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:05,520
I like how her kitchen is right next to her gus. That's cool. I want food right next to me all the time

673
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:09,520
I like believed her I believed her

674
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,360
She doesn't even like change the tone of her voice

675
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:25,680
You can't you didn't change your tone of voice at all when lying

676
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:36,320
Is that 200 by people never trust reya? I can't tell

677
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:39,520
You can tell really good mercy you caught on to me

678
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:43,120
My mouth is dry

679
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:45,440
I'm sorry Reya

680
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:49,280
Thank you, she knew

681
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:53,360
I am

682
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:55,360
I believe

683
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:57,760
I believe right until the end

684
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:02,960
I can never tell if she is ever lying or not. I can never tell if

685
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:06,640
I can tell

686
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:09,360
And loud

687
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:15,200
Because every time you you you don't let someone finish

688
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:19,360
It feels like you're being defensive and not letting the person speak. So you

689
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:22,320
I assume that you're the yeah

690
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:26,320
You gotta let me you gotta give me really gotta let me explain the reason

691
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:30,720
You

692
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:36,720
You gotta you gotta let me explain why and then you have to tell me why I'm wrong

693
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:46,080
Well, yeah, because you didn't let me speak

694
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:53,520
Yeah

695
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:55,920
Oh

696
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:09,200
40 days

697
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:14,960
Biblical suspension

698
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:17,360
Yeah

699
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:20,560
So I'll say one thing the girls have never seen me

700
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:24,640
Any other type of motion other than like happy and proud of their work

701
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:29,120
So playing among us when I'm screaming down the make being like it's fucking

702
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:32,480
Is probably quite a surprise. It is I was just like

703
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:38,960
Nice and refreshing

704
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:46,800
I want to I want to see a zara and rea or stronti and rea team up. That's what I want to say. That'd be funny

705
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:50,640
I haven't gotten imposter once

706
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:53,360
Yeah, guys, let's give us a chance

707
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:59,600
Let's give us our imposter the statistics of a zero being imposter very high. No, just keep that in mind

708
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:01,760
By the way for your probability

709
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:06,800
Don't do that. See look. She's gaslighting you man. I'm gonna get killed. She says things like this

710
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:09,760
Everybody

711
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:14,640
I'm eating goldfish

712
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:22,160
This is a regular kind of goldfish always sus stronti because he says the sus is shit ever

713
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:29,840
Again

714
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:39,760
Over here

715
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:44,560
My cat is walking around my desk, sir

716
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:50,640
What are you looking for? There's nothing here for you. Sorry. I'm talking to my cat. Hi stronti

717
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:58,080
What do you want dude

718
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,360
You can hang out

719
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:04,960
Okay

720
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:09,520
Hmm

721
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:11,920
Lotta D lotta da

722
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:14,880
lotta do

723
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:17,280
Just doing the work. I'm supposed to

724
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:20,320
Because that's what bunnies do

725
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
I'm pretty good at my job

726
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:28,240
I could eat some corn on the cob

727
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:32,480
Don't know

728
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:40,720
Wait, where's the body? Where was the other body? Oh my god. Oh my god. Holy shit. All right. Well

729
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:47,760
Wait, where was everyone? I was about to report wait, wait, wait, where's my let me talk to she saw the body

730
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:53,600
Rae was literally with me and stronti as well. I saw stronti. I passed by those two

731
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
I wasn't like your cold. There was a body there

732
01:24:56,720 --> 01:24:58,720
Um, well

733
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:01,040
First of all

734
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:02,400
Excuse me

735
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:08,000
Secondly, I was shooting asteroids and I walked down and there was a body at oxygen and it was mimosa

736
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:14,400
She was probably doing like a little shoot being up by is anyone being a navigation or two or weapons?

737
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:17,920
Yes, or no. Yes. No, I was in cafeteria

738
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:24,560
I was about to do electrical. Who is cafeteria? I know it's stronti. I just know it's stronti. I just know it's stronti

739
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:30,880
No, I think you're fucking wait. Hold on a minute. Hold on a minute. I see who's been near

740
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:37,040
weapons o2 navigation because you have reported the body and where o2 and you automatically go is stronti

741
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:39,520
Sorry, I know you love playing these main games

742
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:47,680
No, no, no, no, I was shooting asteroids. It's stronti. I mean, it's stronti

743
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:54,240
Notice how I'm nice and calm and she's freaking out and that's almost that

744
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:59,360
Because you're picking on me when you were self reported the body when you're the only person who's been witness

745
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,400
Or two navigation well clearly because the body was wait was there for a lot longer

746
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:07,280
The body must have been there for a while

747
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:13,360
I was chilling in the cafeteria talking to my cat and then I went and shot some asteroids

748
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:20,880
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. I mean, who are you with again? I was with reya and stronti was in the room with us when we swiped the cards

749
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:23,680
Yeah, I was in the acting room. We were hanging out

750
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:25,600
Where was reya's body?

751
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:29,120
No, I didn't know because she was alive and then when she walked off and then

752
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:32,960
That's and then I was singing a song going somewhere

753
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:43,440
When the round goes fast is stronti because stronti kills fast

754
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:52,480
All right, thank you, thank you. Thank you. Oh my god

755
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:56,800
Good luck

756
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:01,360
Oh

757
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:21,920
The moment she starts getting defensive and loud she is the imposter

758
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:33,920
I know that's what I mean. I'm like I had had to have happened long ago

759
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:48,000
I wish you guys could see all the gesturing that I'm doing right now

760
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:54,160
I do I was chilling eating golden fish you are evil

761
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:03,680
When the when the killing goes fast and when she gets defensive, you know, it's stronti

762
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:09,440
When reya up same

763
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:12,160
It's reya

764
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:15,520
When rain starts accusing her own teammates, it's rain

765
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:20,880
I'm learning I'm learning their strats

766
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:23,440
I

767
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:26,320
Don't accuse my teammates all the time

768
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:30,160
That's just her strats to kill her teammates

769
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:43,200
Oh, no, don't die you're so hot

770
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:46,720
Hi

771
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:48,080
All right, um

772
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:49,680
Mamosa

773
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:54,960
Mercy, why are you guys following me? I don't I'm choking a goldfish. I don't trust I don't trust either of you

774
01:28:55,680 --> 01:28:59,040
It's not me. I'm watching rain. I'm watching. No

775
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:09,120
I'm gonna get a little closer. No, get away from me. Get away from me. Get away from me. Please. Please. No. No, it's not me

776
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:12,960
It's not me. It's not me. It's not me. Oh, please you guys are so

777
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:15,280
So accusatory

778
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:18,160
What do you mean? I'm so accusatory. You're the one who is following azura

779
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:21,680
Because I was apologizing to her

780
01:29:22,240 --> 01:29:26,000
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah likely story rain likely story

781
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:31,280

782
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:33,840
You know, I'm sorry. Okay, that's what happened last time. All right

783
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:39,520
All right, you're gonna kill me the orange you what I'm literally doing my own thing. I'm trying to get over here

784
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:41,520
I don't know

785
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:45,520
Hello

786
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:49,040
Are you sniffing me?

787
01:29:55,840 --> 01:30:01,760
Hey, I want everyone to tell me their location right now. I was sniffing shabby

788
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:06,320
She was I was doing the events or whatever it's called

789
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:09,760
Okay, it's not azura. I promise you

790
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:12,880
I think it's rain

791
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:27,040
I saw rain

792
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:30,720
Stocking azura

793
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:33,040
That's all I'm gonna say

794
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:38,720
Are you kidding me? I said no, no, I'm not saying it's you. I'm saying it's rain. Oh

795
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:44,000
No, let me vouch for people. It's not azura or shibi. Okay. Look, let's see. I'm vouching for people

796
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:50,960
It's definitely because shibi was following me and then I was following azura and then Amy. Imi was sniffing my ass

797
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
Who I was doing the leaves

798
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:56,400
Listen, I don't want to ditch my gen

799
01:30:56,800 --> 01:31:00,560
Look, I don't want to accuse my gen but Imi like you're a little bit quieter than she usually are

800
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:02,560
Strawny, why are you so quiet?

801
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:15,040
I'm in storage with

802
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:18,400
We're on our way to cafeteria azura and I

803
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:22,640
I was in storage with Imi

804
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:24,800
That is me and shibi

805
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:26,400
Imi

806
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:28,400
So then mercy and Imi then

807
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:34,960
I will only say that I was not with rain the entire time

808
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:49,440
I don't know if it's rain or Imi if Imi was biting her time because she almost hurt me again

809
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:54,080
I think it's mercy

810
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:07,520
I'm voting rain. I'm voting rain. Whatever. I don't know. I don't fucking know. Imi. I swear to god. Imi

811
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:25,760
Yeah, mercy, what the hell

01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:00,800
What are you talking about rain?

817
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:02,720

Where's Azura?

911
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:22,320
I was vouching for wait a second. I heard you whispering to yourself Azura

912
01:42:23,440 --> 01:42:25,440
Yeah

913
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:28,800

What were you whispering you sounded hella sus. It's like you you said, where did she go? Where did she go?

915
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:41,520

916
01:42:41,680 --> 01:42:46,800
I have a feeling I could be wrong. I you you trust me on this one. I promise. I'm not lying

917
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:54,160
It's I'm just I thought it was Imi, but I think it might be rea or Azura. Okay. It's not rea

918
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:56,960
It's literally not rea. I watched her do a body scan

919
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:03,440
Just didn't kill anyone that first round. It's Azura or Imi trust them. Okay. Where's Imi?

920
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:09,360
Where is she? She dead somewhere? Okay, she's right here

921
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:22,240
Okay, I need to do some my tasks. How about that? All right, me too. All right, Imi if it's

922
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:25,760
Oh mimosa mimosa

923
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:31,680
It might be mimosa because she did a double take but then she realized somebody was nearby

924
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:35,040
I need to tell somebody this information

925
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:39,600
Okay, I'm gonna tell you something in case I die. No

926
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:44,320
It might be mimosa because she did a double take but then she saw rea was nearby

927
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:49,840
Oh my god. Oh wait. Just kidding. Nevermind. It's Imi

928
01:43:53,120 --> 01:43:55,120
Oh my god

929
01:43:56,720 --> 01:43:58,720
Oh, okay. Well, it's not mimosa

930
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:06,800
No, no, uh rain was with me a rain was with me

931
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:15,280
I I went yeah, I was with everyone and I ran over to rain to tell her that I thought it was mimosa, but apparently it's not because she's dead

932
01:44:16,240 --> 01:44:19,600
Because mimosa did a double take and I thought she was gonna kill me

933
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:33,760
I didn't see her. I didn't see her killer though. Listen, if it's not Imi. It's rea. Trust me. No, it's not rea

934
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:39,360
I saw her do a body scan, but she's the one like she might not have killed that round. I'm sorry. Imi

935
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:50,560
Oh, no

936
01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:53,280
Oh

937
01:44:53,600 --> 01:45:00,080
Wait a second. It's not me rain. You just have a seductive suspicious suspicious voice

Listen, I solemnly swear. Okay, rea. We're the only ones we can trust

939
01:45:07,120 --> 01:45:10,320
We have to figure out if it's a zur or rain

940
01:45:11,440 --> 01:45:13,440
I think it's rea

941
01:45:13,440 --> 01:45:19,440
It's not rea. I saw her do a body scan. All right, then it's a zur. I don't know. Let's let's vote

01:45:38,720 --> 01:45:42,720
Who was what if it's she be because rea said that she be never scanned?

948
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:47,120
Well, I didn't have a scan. I that was my thing. She be could be yeah

Yay, it's not really much of a conclusion other than us all accusing each other and never talking

987
01:49:54,340 --> 01:49:56,340
We deserve a call

988
01:50:00,740 --> 01:50:02,740

She's saying I'm a weird looking rabbit

1012
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:26,000
She's the ice holder I was a carrot Mamosa. Why are you standing scarily to the side?

1013
01:52:27,280 --> 01:52:31,960
Waiting for her moment like hello, where's a zero

1014
01:52:38,300 --> 01:52:40,300

01:54:03,120 --> 01:54:07,640
Don't know who to put I don't know if it's Johnny or Mamosa. I don't know if it's Johnny or Mamosa

1026
01:54:12,560 --> 01:54:16,920
You think it's it's Johnny Mamosa. Oh, no, I wish I voted

1027
01:54:33,120 --> 01:54:35,120
Yeah

1028
01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:43,920
It's Johnny, it's Johnny

1029
01:54:48,320 --> 01:54:50,320
Dude

1030
01:54:51,800 --> 01:54:53,800

1034
01:55:33,120 --> 01:55:39,560

1035
01:55:46,320 --> 01:55:50,320
I have seen because I knew if I voted I feel like I would have tied it

1036
01:55:58,240 --> 01:56:01,560
You did the same thing to me when we both were innocent

1037
01:56:03,120 --> 01:56:08,000
He doesn't listen to people

1038
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:27,480
Refling has said it's not about Johnny being nice or not

1039
01:56:27,480 --> 01:56:31,080
It's about me being dangerous which has been proven in previous rounds

1040
01:56:31,960 --> 01:56:33,960
Leave me when I'm freaking a crewmate

1041
01:56:35,600 --> 01:56:42,360
Yeah, it's true and every time every time we start you always say that it's probably always gonna be someone or you say that

1042
01:56:56,560 --> 01:56:58,560
I hope scrawny is an imposter

1043
01:57:01,080 --> 01:57:03,080
First

1044
01:57:06,200 --> 01:57:10,640
She's a pasta don't worry mercy. I'll guard you with rea

1045
01:57:12,560 --> 01:57:16,340
That will be so funny if like it is scrawny and she comes

1046
01:57:19,080 --> 01:57:24,400
Please don't hurt me. Oh, I'm really focused on this card read. Can you guys go do that?

1047
01:57:31,080 --> 01:57:33,080
I

1048
01:57:48,720 --> 01:57:51,200
No, it's not I was actually just with scrawny

1049
01:57:51,800 --> 01:57:53,800

01:58:02,480 --> 01:58:04,480
So it wasn't you

1052
01:58:21,200 --> 01:58:26,880
As soon as it's her as soon as she blames me, I know it's rain. I know it's rain

1053
01:58:37,360 --> 01:58:39,360
Her accent

1054
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:49,560
It was the dealio so my most offense the body wear we found out of reactor

1055
01:58:51,200 --> 01:58:53,200
I

1056
01:59:05,360 --> 01:59:07,360
Was just swiping a card

1057
01:59:08,720 --> 01:59:10,720
And I told you guys to go worry about that

1058
01:59:11,720 --> 01:59:13,720

Okay, we're good. I feel like I should go hit the button. No

1098
02:04:05,840 --> 02:04:09,640
Like most of the time forget and I hate doing stuff on electrical

1099
02:04:13,600 --> 02:04:17,400
Because it's perfect time for someone to come up and stab you in the back

1100
02:04:19,880 --> 02:04:25,680
And I'm nervous. Oh, okay, you guys are here cool. I feel a little better unless you both kill me that would be awkward

1101
02:04:28,360 --> 02:04:30,360
Oh

1102
02:04:39,880 --> 02:04:43,640
Someone got disconnected and that's why the game ended. That's why

1103
02:04:46,640 --> 02:04:48,640
One of the hair was telling me

1104
02:04:57,640 --> 02:05:02,600
Together in medbay you both together in medbay and I walked into medbay and she was dead

1105
02:05:03,920 --> 02:05:06,160
You killed her in medbay you both were together

1106
02:05:06,880 --> 02:05:08,880
We both saw you

1107
02:05:19,600 --> 02:05:25,520
Listen to me. All right, so we were talking we were hanging outside of maybe me and ame was looking outside of medbay

1108
02:05:25,520 --> 02:05:28,360
We were looking outside of maybe yeah, mercy and

1109
02:05:29,640 --> 02:05:32,320
mercy and rain was in medbay together and

1110
02:05:33,080 --> 02:05:37,560
Ame went off and then I went down and rain was dead

1111
02:05:38,360 --> 02:05:43,560
Okay, you want me to tell my story? I walked into medbay. I did the little thing

1112
02:05:43,560 --> 02:05:47,560
It said I was purple three as purple three and I told rain to guard me

1113
02:05:48,120 --> 02:05:54,800
Because I didn't trust rain and then I walk outside. I lost rain for a second. I walk out and I see Azra kill rain

1114
02:05:55,520 --> 02:05:59,860
I saw the body. Why you've been so good at gaslighting this entire time

1115
02:06:02,360 --> 02:06:08,160
Something tells me it's Azra. I've had so many L's. I've had so many L's this entire time

1116
02:06:08,520 --> 02:06:11,440
Something tells me it's Azra, but I'm gonna skip

1117
02:06:17,040 --> 02:06:19,040
I have seen from this note

1118
02:06:26,360 --> 02:06:28,360
See

1119
02:06:36,640 --> 02:06:38,640
She was a bit shaky she was

1120
02:06:45,120 --> 02:06:48,000
Mercy just know if you're not an imposter. I didn't kill you

1121
02:06:48,600 --> 02:06:50,600
Watch this

1122
02:06:53,400 --> 02:06:57,000
I had a feeling I told you my gut doesn't lie

1123
02:06:58,200 --> 02:07:00,200
All right, all right, all right

1124
02:07:00,800 --> 02:07:05,620
Because there is still a bit there's a vent in medbay. There's still a bit. I'm keeping an eye

1125
02:07:06,120 --> 02:07:08,120
I'm keeping an eye on Azra

1126
02:07:08,560 --> 02:07:11,520
You could stay with me trust stay with me. It's not me

1127
02:07:12,680 --> 02:07:14,920
Stay with me. It's funny if I just fucking died

1128
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
It's not me trust us

1129
02:07:22,320 --> 02:07:27,880
You know what I'm gonna go over here cuz I'm too lazy. Hey, what's up? I'm a most I'm a most you've been quiet. What's up, baby girl?

1130
02:07:27,880 --> 02:07:29,880
I

1131
02:07:47,040 --> 02:07:50,160
Should have voted for it, but even if I vote for a zero would have been a tie

1132
02:07:58,800 --> 02:08:00,800
I

1133
02:08:01,200 --> 02:08:03,200
Everybody she's satisfied

1134
02:08:17,800 --> 02:08:20,240
We gotta play gargoyle phone with you guys

1135
02:08:28,840 --> 02:08:32,560
I will this is this has been a stain

1136
02:08:44,200 --> 02:08:48,840
Rain's voice never falters when she's an imposter also cutely evil

1137
02:08:57,880 --> 02:08:59,880
Disconnected no, that's what happened

02:10:37,240 --> 02:10:41,000
So much blood. I have never seen strutting it's so

1151
02:10:46,160 --> 02:10:49,520
Just the just the passion and determination

1152
02:10:50,720 --> 02:10:57,840
Anytime she defended herself was so funny and it was it's it's it's good learning of

1153
02:10:58,760 --> 02:11:02,160
The girls tells I'm like I was pretty good with my instincts

1154
02:11:02,160 --> 02:11:07,200
I was so good with my instincts, but then I just I didn't trust myself. I didn't trust myself

1155
02:11:08,280 --> 02:11:13,800
She said I know she wasn't she just it's just she does. This is her voice

1197
02:14:46,960 --> 02:14:49,560
