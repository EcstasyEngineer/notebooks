00:00:30,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm going to do a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little

6
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:24,920
Look who it is. If it isn't a couple of losers. Do you like my cover up? I think it's effective.

7
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:33,960
harlots today. It's my little sensor bar and also if you don't know my name I

8
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:39,840
think it's effective. Hello hello how's it going? It's going good! Having a good

9
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:48,080
day today. Lounge in Maxon and Relaxon. We'll listen to a little bit of Kylie

10
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:57,040
Minogue of some pre-stream prep. I would really like to dance a bunch and just

11
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,160
get real hype before stream. Don't forget to tweet. You're correct. You're

12
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:10,480
correct. Can't forget. I smell absolutely delicious because I just came out of the

13
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:16,600
shower and I forgot, boomie with the home, and I forgot I had some of my

14
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:27,160
favorite lotion left. I really like the smell of pansy from Lush. It's funny

15
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:34,080
because on my friend it smelled like old lady flowers but on me I

16
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:41,840
don't know. Maybe it's my pheromones. It just smells absolutely delicious. Oh we

17
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:50,640
getting raided! Raflin ride! Holy crap! It's Momay! Have fun beating the crabs!

18
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:58,560
Forever beating back the crabs. How was the monetization stream? Oh did you guys

19
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:07,640
have a nice dose of Momay feet? Can I get a sniffer? This is me smelling

20
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:16,120
Strony's feet. Oh god. Smells smells like salty sea brine. Fucking love it!

21
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:24,960
Momay's monkey feet! I honestly I'm very impressed with her dexterity with her

22
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:31,080
feet. Like I definitely I don't I could probably hold something but she was

23
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:36,880
like doing the whole thing where she's like sticking like ASMR tools in your

24
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:45,840
ear and I was just I was impressed. I just lurked because I was beating my

25
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:57,480
I mean I mean I was trying to practice my own foot dexterity. So now do your

26
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:01,920
foot ASMR stream. Yeah I'm waiting for my red high heels to come in. I need to get

27
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:08,400
my so like I said that was like that picture I took was from like a month

28
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:19,520
ago. So I need to get my toes done again. Great carpet clenches. Carpet clenches.

29
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:28,040
Now that that's one. Carpet grippers. Yeah I got I got the watch of my

30
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:35,240
collards. I got my tights. Now I just need the heels. I still haven't tried on the

31
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,880
cosplay. I need to do that. And if it doesn't fit I might just wear the shirt

32
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,600
unbuttoned and then this this just like I'll just find it try to find it with

33
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:51,320
mini skirt. Heel dangle. Oh yeah. Love my giant name tag. Thank you. It's my my

34
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:56,160
cover-up. I think it's doing a pretty good job. It's not transparent or

35
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:06,160
anything. Carp. I don't know if I would call it like a carpet clencher. Like use

36
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:12,480
feet for that on a the other type of carpet. That just sounds painful. Like

37
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:18,800
did you ever like have that one person or friend that could like use their feet

38
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,680
and like pinch you with them? One of my childhood friends would freak me out by

39
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,080
doing that. Maybe that's not what that's why I'm not into feet is because I was

40
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:32,720
traumatized by my friend pinching you with her monkey feet. So like imagine

41
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,080
like oh my god ASMR roleplay where Shawnee pinches you with her feet as

42
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:46,800
punishment. Yep yep. Brother can snap with his toes. What the hell? That's just

43
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:54,480
Is he a mutant? Or is she a Scott? No. She was just blonde white girl.

44
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,880
And she had the she had a valley girl accent.

45
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:11,520
Very funny. Where is she pinching? Well in terms of Shawnee, I don't know that's up to her.

46
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:18,240
Sorry. I'm adjusting myself a little bit here. I can use my feet to pick up the small objects

47
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,400
on the other side of my desk. What the fuck? Thank you. Thank you. I have a great sensor.

48
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:31,040
Ebony Darkness. Ebony. She she uh Shibbony. Shibbony Darkness took over my channel for a

49
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:35,280
couple of streams yesterday. My cats have the zoomies right now. What are you doing?

50
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:40,560
Can you chill out and stop chasing her? Oomie's like harassing a sister.

51
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:47,280
I hope you guys enjoyed her. She was she was pretty cool. She's a little bit too edgy for my

52
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:57,200
taste. But uh yeah she's nice. Just like um the other other lady that uh was running that one bar.

53
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,960
She can also disconnect her head from her body. It's really impressive. I wish I had that skill

54
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:05,120
you know. 10 hour stream today. I I think not.

55
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:15,920
I think not. I think uh just because I don't think I have I'll probably end up rage quitting

56
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,760
especially with the level the portion of the part that we're on for um uh another crabs

57
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:29,440
event uh adventure. Another crabs treasure. Nine hour stream then. And a lot of fanfic reading

58
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:36,080
happened. I went done no I went uphill. We were on a straight incline. We talked about you know how

59
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:44,720
Hogwarts and a squid made beautiful consensual love. Um

60
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:54,640
can you hear my cats zooming around my house right now? I turn off the filter so you can.

61
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,240
You hear there's a little just like galloping and then they're they're tokyo drifting around

62
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:05,040
the corners in my apartment. Just don't be bad at video game. Uh that's impossible for me.

63
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:15,200
Don't run with your wands out. Yeah there was just like scrawny um squid inked everywhere in Hogwarts.

64
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,680
I have some delicious tea. Heard it a little. No.

65
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:29,040
It's because Fia likes to take refuge by my feet under my desk. I'm like I'm like you know how

66
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:36,240
when you play tag as a kid or like just some sort of tag related game um you would have like a

67
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:42,240
home base where you were safe especially if it was like freeze tag or something. That's what they

68
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,920
use me as. I'm not even joking. If I'm in any part of the house and they're running around

69
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,760
Boomi and Fia will use me as like a home base. Hello welcome in.

70
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:02,480
What literary masterpiece did you miss yesterday? You missed uh 15 chapters of My Immortal and um

71
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:10,880
the actual castle Hogwarts being uh tentacle banged by a giant squid. So if you ever check

72
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:19,840
those out go check them out. You know I'm also working on um I'm gonna re uh public I don't

73
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:25,120
know what the fuck I'm saying. I'm gonna make public that class of 09 VOD that everybody loved.

74
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:31,200
I'm just waiting to get monetization before I do because I feel like they would go on that and

75
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,200
they'd be like wow this is bad. We thought the other video was bad of class of what this is worse.

76
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,720
That was my cat.

77
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:50,960
They're zooming. Yeah yeah I gotta gotta sneak it one in. Yeah I don't they they were pretty like

78
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:56,720
Boomi was chilling next to me and then they just started zooming. Happy Tuesday. It's Tuesday unit!

79
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,880
Rob, Rob is fucking Tuesday. I can fucking say it. It's Tuesday.

80
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:12,160
First get monetized then get canceled. Um you know my attempt at speedrunning getting canceled has

81
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:22,480
not worked. I'm very surprised by that. It's Chokshik Tuesday. She'd be Tuesday. I'm really

82
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,800
excited to hopefully be um do the monetization stream and do like member streams because I'm

83
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,840
telling you I want to do that self-tying shabar stream. You can't see what I'm pointing at you

84
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:36,400
and waggling my finger like a teacher who knows you're up to no good because you copied off of

85
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:44,240
someone's homework. I'm very very excited for the power wash collab this week. That is going to be

86
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:52,800
funny as hell. I'm debating whether or not to stream my viewpoint. What do you guys think?

87
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,320
Like what do you want? Because it's going to be all of us streaming at the same time and I'm like

88
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,560
what's the point? I'm like I don't know. If you want me to see do you want to see my viewpoint?

89
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:09,760
I'm sorry I can't draw Rob Shibi. It's okay. A lot of the artists that will make commission for me

90
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:18,720
they always drew my ropes as straps. Like even my header art and my twitter and my wallpaper

91
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,760
that I also use it. It's just straps. It's just leather straps. It's not even rope or it looks

92
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:33,920
like ribbon. Give the clippers work. Hey Shibi I bought all 50 parts of the paper. Thanks for the

93
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:42,720
recommendation. Oh my god. That is such a just read like an excerpt from that book and you can

94
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:54,560
thank me later. I managed to shake down Emmy for the book title of the interesting book she wants

95
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:00,080
to read. I read the synopsis and I was like okay this is right up my alley all right. She's like

96
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:06,640
what? And I'm like yeah I'm on that shit and she's like oh okay and then I sent another

97
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:17,280
terrible fucked up smut book her way. I sent her den of vipers. I couldn't even get through that book

98
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:24,400
it was so bad. But I'm like I'm trying to try to convince management to give me a podcast with

99
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:35,680
um uh my IRL friend Salem because she also reads a lot of smutty books and and maybe Emmy and we

100
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,720
can have a little book club together and the other girls because I you know you know mercy reads that

101
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:48,880
shit you know she reads that shit you know and you would like you would like Salem she's cute and

102
00:14:48,880 --> 00:15:03,520
funny maybe I'll drop a PNG for her. Mercy is say so she be. She's she's she's got you guys good huh

103
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:11,920
her sweet little yandere facade yeah yeah just wait just wait till she shows her true power

104
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:19,920
none of you will be safe. My GF right smut ironically I used to write so much

105
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:29,680
smut when I was younger. So Salem is what I call one of my um uh one of my best friends IRL. She is

106
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:39,200
uh very cute and funny she is adorable um she is way more base than I am.

107
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,960
You guys would like her a lot I might just I would probably be it wouldn't be like a live podcast

108
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:53,040
which definitely is like a pre-recorded thing um she heavily supports me v-tubing and she was so proud

109
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:59,360
of me um when I got accepted into VLR her and Olive which is one of my other IRL friends and Olive

110
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,400
is an actress so she was just like yeah entertainment industry so we're all creative types out here

111
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,920
uh bro mercy says she showers once a week and nothing sweet on that girl what do you mean

112
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:15,280
you know it's like when something smells so so bad that it almost smells like sourly sickly sweet

113
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:23,120
that's that's mercy there I say Salem for gen two no she got she got she does not have enough time

114
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:29,120
to be a vtuber she does not have time to be a vtuber she got she got a big girl job

115
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:36,720
envisioned the aroma I yeah I used to I used to write so much fucking smut when I was younger

116
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:43,920
I was no like me and my other my uh one of my childhood best friends um like I mentioned before

117
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:50,880
like we would do post by post role play a lot and then we realized oh my god we're we're good at writing

118
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:57,040
what if we wrote bad stuff and so we would get requests from other students on our our grade

119
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:06,400
mind you this was like fifth grade and we were known as like uh the the lemon girls

120
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,400
if you know what a lemon is

121
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:15,840
and some people would get us requests from their favorite characters and we would write like

122
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:24,720
we take like commissions and we'd be like all right and I'd be like uh insert this classmate's

123
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:37,520
name here with this character from this uh anime it was bad I remember one of the teachers um

124
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:44,720
um found one of the stuff because like we had a we had a notebook dedicated for that shit

125
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:51,360

154
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:26,080
world it was literally like pre covid before covid um but and then she would just be like hey guys

158
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,000
it blew up and they actually published it into books it's the after series now those are toxic

159
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,440
and terrible and then I watched the movies I still have to watch the last one me and me and

160

169
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:12,640
be my my tagline your ex thought those movies were peak romance oh my god it's so bad that's toxic

170
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:19,040
is hell the main kiss so okay so let me explain to you what the after series is it is a One Direction

171
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:26,080
fan fiction where the main character is a self-insert of the author and she is in love with Harry

172
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:32,320
Styles except imagine Harry Styles having an alcoholic dad having an alcoholic problem of his own

173
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:45,440
being only like 18 or 17 uh beating people up doing drugs um imagine also having really bad anger

174
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:55,600
issues imagine uh uh Lewis and Zane and all the other ones as like side characters that try to

175
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:04,080
romance her but they're also toxic as hell exactly boomy um it was bad it was so bad like

176
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:11,360
it's so toxic like they'll just like you know like when you watch a romance movie and like the main

177
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:16,640
couple get like upset with each other but you know it easily could have been solved if they just like

178
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:24,320
said what was on their mind instead of or like asking for clarification because that was the

179
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:31,840
entire movie they just miscommunication between three movies hello hello welcome in

180
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:38,800

181

twilight movies i mean i've only seen like the first two and i need to watch the others because

182
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,320
it's a thing that me and my friend used to do every year where we would mute the twilight movie

183
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:54,240
and we would just dub over it with our own voices and pretend to know what was going on in the scene

184
00:24:54,240 --> 00:25:02,800
and that was funny as hell titanic oh yes classic love story i'll never let go let's go easily could

00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:13,520
have pulled them onto the door as well i hate that so much i tend to like talk a lot actually

186
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:20,640
you know it really depends um if i'm watching the movie with someone who's never watched it before

187
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,280
i will just shut up and i'll just like stare at the person be like i hope they like it but if it's

00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,120

00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,880
oh i fucked myself up there i didn't mean to press that button

424
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,040
oh

425
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:19,520
what the hell he has another hand he can use his other hand

426
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:25,840
like i ninja run

427
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:35,840
um

428
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:45,840
he wasn't using his other arm before

429
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:59,120
damn it i was hoping he was going to do the jump forward attack

430
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:03,680
but i when he gets to halfway is when he does both hands

431
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:12,080
using your other hand is a good skill to have it's annoying that there's no light

432
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:15,600
shells in that area the dodge window with medium shells one bit brutal yeah

433
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:23,600
you know bring up the strong hand i think of that like scary movie with the guy with

434
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:27,600
those little hands

435
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:47,600
why i didn't why isn't it working oh my god come closer please

436
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:57,600
so

437
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:26,720
I guess I rolled into that and I didn't run up close enough.

438
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:34,480
There's a parry mechanic. I still haven't gotten the timing yet. It's like really weird.

439
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:39,200
I can parry like a fucking god and Liza P but

440
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,840
in this game I'm just not good.

441
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:56,240
Okay it's important to do it only when it's close.

442
00:57:56,240 --> 00:58:13,200
Oh fuck I ran past one.

443
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:22,480
There is a light shell it's right there.

444
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:26,640
I might actually wait you can't reach me if I'm up here.

445
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,960
Ah bitch come closer.

446
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:37,440
Why don't you get around that little thing so I can do this.

447
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:47,840
We're just gonna look at each other.

448
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:52,800
He has some beautiful eyes. They have a certain glow to them. Did you know that?

449
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:03,200
I can literally kind of cheese him like this.

450
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:07,360
Just stay up here and every time I like land a hit on him

451
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:14,400
I get more umami but that would just take forever though.

452
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,480
You're so beautiful I can't stop looking at you.

453
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:22,720
Hold on let me look at chat.

454
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:26,480
I know the parry yet should be obvious in the game once you unlock it though.

455
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,240
I thought the parry is the shell.

456
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,720
Am I playing a mage? I'm a crap.

457
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:40,160
Cheat strat. I can't run past them the place is blocked.

458
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,240
How would I run past the boss?

459
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:49,680
I wonder if this one will glitch like the other one did and just let me hit my little heart

460
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,520
and let me um pass.

461
00:59:51,520 --> 01:00:11,920
Can I have this? Why are you stuck to me?

462
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:21,520
I'm gonna die. I need to run into a can.

463
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,080
Oh that's the one that's broken.

464
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:32,320
Where's the other can?

465
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:47,520
Oh god what does this one do? What's the pop-off do I forget?

466
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:58,720
I rolled. Oh I hate it here.

467
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:03,040
I don't even know what the fuck pop-off even does.

468
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:09,120
Just fucking kill me. I don't even care at this point.

469
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:14,880
This should only let you guard her first.

470
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:18,080
Are you serious? Why don't they let me parry right away?

471
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:22,640
I'm starting to get angry because I suck. I need to get good.

472
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:27,040
Okay so there's one right there, one right there.

473
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:32,400
So I got one, two, three, four chances.

474
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,120
I can also run up here.

475
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:47,440
Like this is also a spot I can like run away from.

476
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:58,720
I like wasted it though.

477
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:06,400
Can I hit you?

478
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:12,240
Okay you can still hit me up here but not that well though.

479
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:26,560
Is this a strat? Keep him in the corner.

480
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,040
I think it's a strat.

481
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,720
Yep it's a strat.

482
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:54,000
I am in the map.

483
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,720
It could be one of those bosses you're gonna come back later when you're powerful enough.

484
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:05,920
No it's not. This is where I need to go to progress.

485
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:15,120
I forgot I just like jumped down one time. Oh I fucked myself.

486
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:20,240
I fucked myself my last run because oh I don't even fucking give a shit anymore.

487
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:26,640
I think this is the cheese strat.

488
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:42,560
Thrust is so hard to say through a wall. All right come here big boy.

489
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:54,320
If he jumps you can make it up there.

490
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:17,920
Come here. Come over here. Come here. Get over here please.

491
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:27,200
Haha you fucking miss bitch. Suck my titties.

492
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:43,200
Oh buddy.

493
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:46,480
Oh.

494
01:04:55,600 --> 01:05:08,480
Then he'll usually go at me with that. Okay.

495
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:22,480
You're a crab not a scorpion.

496
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:27,120
Seems like the game wants you to get good at dodging heavy attacks.

497
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:38,480
Well I'm not going to so this is how I play.

498
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:52,480
Did I or did I not roll out of the fucking way for that? What the fuck is my hitbox dude?

499
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:06,480
See you just fucked myself again.

500
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:18,480
Remember the fives of dodgeball? I watched that movie again recently.

501
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:31,600
Fives of dodgeball be a pussy.

502
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:44,800
Is there like lag to when I fucking dodge?

503
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:50,880
I am really pressing the fucking roll button.

504
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:58,880
You actual fucking cocksucker. I swear to...

505
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:08,880
Get out of my face. Get out of my fucking face.

506
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:26,880
Come closer.

507
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:37,040
Sorry I'm a mad.

508
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:43,200
I ran into that.

509
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:51,440
I'm a little confused because

510
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:59,120
my shell doesn't take the brunt of the heavy attack.

511
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:03,760
When he goes into a second phase he just kills me.

512
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:09,360
When it's in his first phase and he does a heavy attack it just breaks my shell.

513
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:16,720
I don't quite understand that.

514
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:25,280
I need an audio or mad. I'm as mad as that or more.

515
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:36,400
Like I usually don't like playing souls likes on stream because I get really angry

516
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:45,360
and I personally don't think it's the funnest gameplay to watch to just watch someone be angry

517
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:51,920
and not be good at a game. Like if you're like angry and then you like kill the boss in your

518
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:56,080
third try you'd be like all right that's pretty sick. But it's like when it's like 20 tries in

519
01:08:56,080 --> 01:09:03,040
and you're like what the fuck like I remember I had a like that stupid clown boss from Lies of P

520
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:10,320
took me like three hours of trying in a stream ended up spiking my headphones and breaking

521
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:15,360
them and smashing them through my controller on the ground almost broke my monitor

522
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:24,320
and then in the next two runs I finally beat him but I did that all off stream

523
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:27,200
because I didn't want anybody to see

524
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:38,160
because it's you it's unfortunate training

525
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:47,920
I'm good as long you're having good time well like no like I'm enjoying myself playing like

526
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:53,120
because I like I don't mind Ragey games like this it's just that I personally can't watch somebody

527
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:58,960
play it with something because in my head I tend to backseat and I get frustrated I'm like just

528
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:02,480
fucking beat like you could have just done that there you couldn't like that's how I like watch

529
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:07,360
people who play these games so I get mad watching people play these games and they suck at them

530
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:13,200
like me because like I would go back and watch my vlogs and I'm like I'm such a fucking idiot where

531
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:17,600
the fuck did I do that all right

532
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:35,600
hmm

533
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:43,600
okay he clips through that so I don't want to

534
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:50,320
I like I literally will jump and it takes forever I'm like is it my controller

535
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:55,280
I have like a fucking Thunderbolt C so it's not like is it the cable I don't

536
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:02,800
why is there such a delay in my like I'm pressing stuff before it happens and then it happens a second later

537
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:13,280
so

538
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:30,720
at least you get stuck on that little embankment so I can chill for a second

539
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:38,160
huh uh I just choked on my spit

540
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:45,600
do you have dead zones on what's that

541
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:54,480
I didn't feel like there was a delay when I was playing so it could be an issue

542
01:11:55,280 --> 01:12:01,840
controller dead zones can delay you I don't know what that means

543
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:08,880
maybe we should hit the boss a little bit then back away hit him again thanks Sachiko aren't you

544
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:16,720
a fucking genius bro it's medium weight dodge roll is it is it really the dodge roll

545
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:22,080
yo how you been snowflake this is what the fuck I'm not icy

546
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:25,920
dead zones are like how far you move the stick until registers an input

547
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:30,400
maybe it's a ps5 controller

548
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,040
okay he's kind of stuck on that

549
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:49,200
how the how the fuck did he run after me so fast

550
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:51,520
okay he's on this

551
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:57,760
he's on the piercing part of his face

552
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:13,520
oh I thought I had some can you come over here instead you come over here

553

559
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:22,720

560
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:36,720

561
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:46,720
have you tried shooting it hold on hold on hold on

562
01:14:50,800 --> 01:15:10,800
all right let's see if shooting it helps

563
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:17,360
I wish I had a toggle on this so that it would show like a muzzle flash

564
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:22,720
okay

565
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:34,640

572
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:16,880
like to run it takes me it's an extra just like a second delay

573
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:23,280
there's a hundred percent a like a one second delay when I do anything

574
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:39,360
he's on my booty hole he is on my booty cheeks

575
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:53,840

606
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:14,160
the hermit crab will need to further expand on its omami abilities

607
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:19,280
I don't think I can do the ash catching voice it's creating my my throat

I mean um the hermit crab closes his eyes and allows himself to become one with the waves

610
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:41,680
he notices the effect on his body has on I can't read the currents around him

611
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:46,400
and lets himself be changed by them in turn okay

612
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:56,560
hey when I close my eyes I can start to see something I see a tree some sort of tree of skills

613
01:21:56,720 --> 01:22:00,240
shell deportation oh

614
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:09,360
I have every single thing leaves currents in the wake in its wake why can't I read today

615
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:14,480
as it travels through his ocean this ocean I have dyslexia

616
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:22,320
be it a living person a beast a corpse but even a piece of garbage

617
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:27,280
gabbage the life force of the ocean the beating heart of this world

618
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:34,960
this phenomenon is known as umami invisible to most umami currents can be detected only

619
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:43,520
by chosen few excuse me even fewer still can make use of them oh the glowing purple stuff

620
01:22:44,240 --> 01:22:47,040
I've seen that surrounding some big shells and crystals out there

621
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:51,440
surprising I guess I didn't you know zap you that I mean um

622
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:56,240
the hermit crab's training may progress faster than anticipated

623
01:22:57,040 --> 01:23:03,440
he feels that perhaps if he enters a discarded moon snail shell a new use for it's might reveal itself

624
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:13,200
the dyslexia whose dyslexia must be a baddie

625
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:18,880
yeah that was that was the snail that wasn't me guys

626
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:25,760
you can read not really shell deporting

627
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:35,120
that's the same sound I swear that's used by

628
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:41,360
I call the lamb for something

629
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:51,040
uh much money I got

630
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:01,040
fuck your mother

631
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:07,280
what sort of build should I go for guys

632
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:13,680
shell collection oh shit

633
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:29,040
even if I get the shell it doesn't have a spell on it

634
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:43,280
fast tonight in uh I had I played only three hours of balder's gate three

635
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:49,040
and I got bored and I haven't played it since

636
01:24:58,160 --> 01:24:58,800
gun build

637
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:07,760
but I feel like maybe if I because I think I went into the game expecting I guess Scott

638
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:14,320
because I've never played any game like I never played um uh well I did play like dragon age

639
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:21,760
inquisition I didn't like it either um I didn't I thought balder's gate would play more like

640
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:29,760
like skyrim does or like oblivion and it doesn't I'm not a huge fan of turn-based games the only

641
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:34,880
like turn-based game I'm a fan of is fire emblem three houses

642
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:43,360
okay now where the fuck do I go oh I need to teleport back we need to talk to you again

643

646
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:09,040
from a sense of aggression

647

01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:15,600
okay

654
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:16,900
okay

655
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:19,840
that's a night in

656
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:28,720
is there a way to reduce that controller like stuff

657
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:35,200
like it in my I don't know if it's the because I never had this problem with lies of pee

658
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:39,840
don't quite understand it okay I have to teleport back

659
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:46,500
you

660
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:53,440
harlots are sassy today

661
01:27:56,240 --> 01:28:01,600
she hates to be RPGs um should check out outer worlds I've been told to play outer worlds

662
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:07,360
I was getting out of scrolls I too polar opposite of RPG that's what I mean I realized I like elder scrolls

663
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:16,560
polar pull of RPGs so if they reload I've actually never played for any persona game

664
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:22,080
through I wish they had something more open world probably like follow new bangas yeah

665
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:30,160
a vowed coming what's a vowed bear what a collab with the girls playing oh yeah no I

666
01:28:30,160 --> 01:28:35,440
would totally play with them might just be the games built in input lag maybe

667
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:45,600
yeah screw the storyline it's all that matters this game looks like Elden Ring I don't know

668
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:48,000
I don't know fucking Elden Ring you've been playing

669
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:56,480
um yeah I know strong he's gonna be playing Elden Ring every go a type of run she's doing

670
01:28:57,040 --> 01:29:05,440
I uh I will maybe all get Elden Ring since people keep asking why did I I meant to

671
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:12,080
teleport I get distracted maybe I'll play if enough people want me to after she plays

672
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:28,720
um can marry Ronnie or something because I got the frenzied flame ending last time I played

673
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:41,600
can you tell me how taxes work the hem at crab nose instinctively to stop pushing luck

674
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:44,320
I like that character I like the moves now character

675
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:49,360

676
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:07,520
okay am I tripping or before the song started did it go one two three four

677
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:15,360
because I heard a whisper of a voice and I'm scared I'm losing my mind

678
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:21,680
you got the Elden Ring deal yeah I got um shout-outs of the air tree a little bit

679
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:31,840
earlier than most it's pretty sick uh where do I go is it this way is there a map

680
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:35,920

681
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:44,640

684
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:05,920

688
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:36,160

689
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:47,760

do I want to even try to kill you

691
01:31:57,680 --> 01:32:02,720
I could use the micro plastics I don't like

692
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:12,720
actually you seem like you have as much like a little bit less

693
01:32:14,240 --> 01:32:18,720
health than the other dude actually no yeah I can kill you what

694
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:34,000
okay you're done did I parry I don't think I parried there but whatever

695
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:44,640
if you're beating Elden Ring how come you just suck so much of this game that's a great question

696
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:55,040
actually I didn't like beat Elden Ring in a short amount of time I did it in like 150 hours or more

697
01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:01,200
it's like a long clam

698
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:07,280
oh uh can you not kill me oh

699
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:09,520
okay

700
01:33:13,680 --> 01:33:16,960
all right I like this power actually

701
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:28,640
oh so if I do the run and lunging attack I want to run lunging attack okay cool

702
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:30,400

703
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:40,240
every souls game I could use the blank I can kill you jumps on the sword I didn't mean I don't

704
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:41,760
even know how I jumped on the sword

705
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:48,800
to be fair Elden Ring dodge is better than this game here you're supposed to block parry more

706
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:55,440
than dodge it seems like it Elden Ring isn't a cleverly disguised platformer now that's

707
01:33:55,440 --> 01:34:02,640
eyes of pee those lobsters were using straws isn't that enough straw sample player second power

708
01:34:02,640 --> 01:34:04,880
oh I have to go around see this crab

709
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:08,640

711
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:20,400
any more like Sakura I guess

712
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:25,520
oh Elden Lord she be what is your wisdom for the day

713
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:34,080
uh do not use a three in one shampoo

714
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:41,520

715
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:45,280

01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:53,920

717
01:34:59,520 --> 01:34:59,920

01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:18,800
why is there a battery look at

721
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:26,720
zen gunman tipped four dollars thank you zen fun fact hermit crabs are not crabs but shrimp

722
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:32,720
what zero tents worst game my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined

723
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:34,400
is that true

724
01:35:39,120 --> 01:35:42,160
wait actually no I was going off the beaten path for a second

725
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,960
are they really actually you know what kind of makes sense

726
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:57,680
just because of the little bodies have you ever seen a hermit crab out of its shell they look

727
01:35:57,680 --> 01:35:58,400
fucking gross

728
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:02,640

how's something that's fucking just stabbing my leg

733
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:41,760
justice show the hermit crabs of Pagore that are mostly closer to squat lobsters

734
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:44,000
porcelain crabs and they are true crabs

735
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:48,960

736
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:57,440

I forget I don't have a fucking shell

745
01:38:00,640 --> 01:38:08,000
got to go fast I'm so happy there is no stamina in this game though maybe that's why

746
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:08,960
there's input lag

747
01:38:11,120 --> 01:38:12,320
look at that imprint this

748
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:22,720
they only have four toes oh no one two three four oh yeah they were just overlapping

749
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:33,680
I don't want to die dies anyway it's you know it's how it be sometimes at least he

750
01:38:33,680 --> 01:38:35,440

778
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:38,720

779
01:42:42,640 --> 01:42:43,280

780
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:52,160
those dudes are fucking dead

781
01:42:52,400 --> 01:43:00,880
um I'm so I don't know how like the lobster was locked on on me when I'm literally up here

782
01:43:07,200 --> 01:43:12,160

783
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:17,760

788
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:21,600

789
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:29,680
can't go that way

790
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:39,600
I can literally just stay on this and just jump not the deal with them

791
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:47,600
um

792
01:44:50,320 --> 01:44:58,080
got this yes I probably have to like fight the queen or something or the duchess

793
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:01,600
doesn't make any sense because then I wouldn't need to pay my taxes anymore

794
01:45:08,400 --> 01:45:13,440
where'd he go team rocket blasting off again am I going to the surface I'm so close to the

797
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:46,720
um

798
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:50,720
I'm letting go

799
01:45:56,720 --> 01:45:57,040
hmm

800
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:03,200
I mean something is up here oh what that

801
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:16,320
I could have sworn I already collected three of those blood star things

802
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:22,720
yeah I thought it was said three I guess it's four

803
01:46:26,240 --> 01:46:30,400
oh here where the options are haha perfect

804
01:46:33,280 --> 01:46:35,280

807
01:46:57,040 --> 01:46:58,800
heart is a default okay

809
01:47:12,640 --> 01:47:18,800
well die the die instantly is good if you get if you get stuck somewhere and you can't get out

810
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:25,040
um I kind of want to see what the gun thing is

811
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:30,400
I can recover micro plastics

812
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:47,600
will that help

813
01:47:53,200 --> 01:47:53,600
maybe

814
01:47:53,600 --> 01:48:04,400
okay

815
01:48:13,280 --> 01:48:16,400
okay

816
01:48:23,600 --> 01:48:39,600
Okay, I'm ready to play now.

817
01:48:39,600 --> 01:49:03,600
Alright, I just want to know how this works.

818
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:15,600
I can't go that way.

819
01:49:15,600 --> 01:49:21,600
Go fucking run!

820
01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:43,600
You're gone for a sentence for you to run in.

821
01:49:43,600 --> 01:49:47,600
You know what it locks? I don't even have to do anything.

822
01:49:47,600 --> 01:49:51,600
Give me that.

823
01:49:51,600 --> 01:49:54,600
What is this?

824
01:49:54,600 --> 01:49:56,600
Oh, sick.

825
01:49:56,600 --> 01:49:58,600
Oh, cool.

826
01:49:58,600 --> 01:50:02,600
Oh, because I probably got to go over.

827
01:50:02,600 --> 01:50:04,600
What the fuck?

828
01:50:04,600 --> 01:50:13,600
Why can't I?

829
01:50:13,600 --> 01:50:16,600
I can't shoot him.

830
01:50:16,600 --> 01:50:21,600
It wouldn't let me lock on.

831
01:50:21,600 --> 01:50:28,600
Wait, wait, hold on. Can you come back?

832
01:50:28,600 --> 01:50:32,600
It literally is a one hit kill.

833
01:50:32,600 --> 01:50:36,600
Alright, I'm ready to face the boss.

834
01:50:36,600 --> 01:50:38,600
That's for sure.

835
01:50:38,600 --> 01:50:43,600
Oh, I can't fucking jump though.

836
01:50:43,600 --> 01:50:48,600
Wait, let me...

837
01:50:48,600 --> 01:50:50,600
I'm a battle crab.

838
01:50:50,600 --> 01:50:52,600
Let me swap real quick.

839
01:50:52,600 --> 01:50:56,600
I'll grab the- I don't know how a gun works underwater.

840
01:50:56,600 --> 01:51:00,600
Come on, I can't make that.

841
01:51:00,600 --> 01:51:06,600
Perfect.

842
01:51:06,600 --> 01:51:08,600
Oh, sick.

843
01:51:08,600 --> 01:51:18,600
Where do I- is this a-

844
01:51:18,600 --> 01:51:20,600
Oh, that's cool.

845
01:51:20,600 --> 01:51:24,600
Kind of just kamikaze yourself.

846
01:51:24,600 --> 01:51:29,600
Alright, grab that gun.

847
01:51:29,600 --> 01:51:36,600
Nice. I don't know how I can pull the trigger.

848
01:51:36,600 --> 01:51:39,600
Are you alive?

849
01:51:39,600 --> 01:51:43,600
You fucking dead? Oh my god, he's fucking dead.

850
01:51:43,600 --> 01:51:45,600
Alright, bitch.

851
01:51:45,600 --> 01:51:54,600
I'm fucking ready.

852
01:51:54,600 --> 01:51:56,600
What is wrong with you?

853
01:51:56,600 --> 01:52:03,600
What the fuck?

854
01:52:03,600 --> 01:52:08,600
Oh, shuck.

855
01:52:08,600 --> 01:52:15,600
Did you see the gun in my ass in the cutscene?

856
01:52:15,600 --> 01:52:20,600
Is oil making all the animals crazy?

857
01:52:20,600 --> 01:52:21,600
The fish crazy?

858
01:52:21,600 --> 01:52:35,600
The crustacean's crazy.

859
01:52:35,600 --> 01:52:43,600
Well, I have a fucking gun, so...

860
01:52:44,600 --> 01:53:00,600
All of our lives are a sand beneath the tide. You'll see.

861
01:53:00,600 --> 01:53:04,600
I didn't think it would one-shot her.

862
01:53:04,600 --> 01:53:06,600
I didn't think it would one-shot her.

863
01:53:06,600 --> 01:53:09,600
I thought it would take a bunch of hits on her.

864
01:53:09,600 --> 01:53:23,600
At least five or something.

865
01:53:23,600 --> 01:53:25,600
Holy abalone!

866
01:53:25,600 --> 01:53:31,600
That was a show of a fight, kid, was it?

867
01:53:31,600 --> 01:53:33,600
You were watching the whole thing?

868
01:53:33,600 --> 01:53:37,600
I guess it was too much to ask the soldiers caught you, jerk.

869
01:53:37,600 --> 01:53:41,600
No such luck. I hit as soon as everyone started going crazy.

870
01:53:41,600 --> 01:53:43,600
Who the fuck is controlling me?

871
01:53:43,600 --> 01:53:47,600
That's the five I never picked a fight he doesn't have up to.

872
01:53:47,600 --> 01:53:50,600
He could learn a thing or two from a guy like me.

873
01:53:50,600 --> 01:53:53,600
Well, now the judges says, you know...

874
01:53:53,600 --> 01:53:56,600
So give me my shot back. You have no reason to keep anymore, right?

875
01:53:56,600 --> 01:54:01,600
Huh, this whole thing, you know, I can barely remember how I got my fins on it anymore.

876
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:04,600
Thinkin' I might just go pawn this off in the big city?

877
01:54:04,600 --> 01:54:06,600
Make myself a few microplastics?

878
01:54:06,600 --> 01:54:09,600
What? What? You can't do that!

879
01:54:09,600 --> 01:54:12,600
I will shoot you into the motherfucking gun.

880
01:54:12,600 --> 01:54:15,600
You're using a human-sized gun and a crab.

881
01:54:15,600 --> 01:54:17,600
I think it's gonna one-shot her.

882
01:54:17,600 --> 01:54:21,600
And that's how you afford a fake taxes.

883
01:54:21,600 --> 01:54:25,600
It's the gun I described earlier, about 100% chance of incident.

884
01:54:25,600 --> 01:54:27,600
Oh!

885
01:54:27,600 --> 01:54:29,600
Excuse me. Oh, so I can do anything he wants.

886
01:54:29,600 --> 01:54:31,600
He's gonna get away with, kid.

887
01:54:31,600 --> 01:54:34,600
See me a new carcinia.

888
01:54:34,600 --> 01:54:36,600
Carcinia.

889
01:54:36,600 --> 01:54:39,600
English. If you wanna buy this bad boy back from me.

890
01:54:39,600 --> 01:54:42,600
If no one else buys it first, that is.

891
01:54:42,600 --> 01:54:44,600
No!

892
01:54:44,600 --> 01:54:47,600
When I get my hands on that guy, I swear, I don't have hands, I have claws.

893
01:54:47,600 --> 01:54:50,600
I swear I'm gonna shoot him.

894
01:54:52,600 --> 01:54:55,600
You have wearing your first adaptation attack.

895
01:54:55,600 --> 01:54:59,600
Wearing from a powerful creature that can be used without even a shell equipped.

896
01:54:59,600 --> 01:55:02,600
Okay, my cat is looking at my foot.

897
01:55:04,600 --> 01:55:07,600
Raina, what are you doing?

898
01:55:07,600 --> 01:55:09,600
Okay.

899
01:55:09,600 --> 01:55:11,600
Oh, that's not it.

900
01:55:11,600 --> 01:55:14,600
The fuck? Where did this come from?

901
01:55:19,600 --> 01:55:21,600
Oh.

902
01:55:21,600 --> 01:55:23,600
Cool.

903
01:55:23,600 --> 01:55:25,600
Okay, but it needs to.

904
01:55:28,600 --> 01:55:30,600
Alright.

905
01:55:34,600 --> 01:55:36,600
She be in the hood.

906
01:55:38,600 --> 01:55:40,600
Let me put the gun away.

907
01:55:42,600 --> 01:55:45,600
I feel like I just cheated. I didn't think that was gonna happen.

908
01:55:45,600 --> 01:55:48,600
It's fine. I probably would have cried for five hours anyways.

909
01:55:48,600 --> 01:55:51,600
Gonna cheese the whole game with the gun.

910
01:55:51,600 --> 01:55:53,600
I'm tempted to.

911
01:55:53,600 --> 01:55:55,600
But I won't.

912
01:56:00,600 --> 01:56:03,600
How does this stay on my ass?

913
01:56:04,600 --> 01:56:06,600
Alright.

914
01:56:22,600 --> 01:56:25,600
I'm just gonna turn that off.

915
01:56:29,600 --> 01:56:31,600
Can I go back? Okay.

916
01:56:31,600 --> 01:56:33,600
I need a...

917
01:56:43,600 --> 01:56:47,600
So, can you hear my controller click when I'm like...

918
01:56:47,600 --> 01:56:50,600
That's like the timing is...

919
01:56:50,600 --> 01:56:53,600
Literally like a half a second off.

920
01:56:58,600 --> 01:57:01,600
So, I'm seeing it putting up the settings.

921
01:57:01,600 --> 01:57:03,600
Yeah, exactly. That's why I'm like...

922
01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:06,600
I'm like, guys, I swear to you, I'm not usually this bad.

923
01:57:06,600 --> 01:57:10,600
Like, I decently got through Lies of Pea

924
01:57:10,600 --> 01:57:14,600
and Elden Ring. It's just such as a fucking delay.

925
01:57:15,600 --> 01:57:19,600
If I put it up to 200, it will happen.

926
01:57:32,600 --> 01:57:35,600
I can't even tell if that's any better.

927
01:57:35,600 --> 01:57:38,600
Maybe PC is better? Let me see.

928
01:57:51,600 --> 01:57:53,600
That is a little bit better.

929
01:57:53,600 --> 01:57:55,600
How do I...

930
01:57:57,600 --> 01:58:00,600
Yeah, it's actually a lot more responsive on PC.

931
01:58:00,600 --> 01:58:05,600
But Jesus fuck, it changes my mouse sensitivity to the fucking moon.

932
01:58:23,600 --> 01:58:25,600
Can I please fucking scroll down?

933
01:58:25,600 --> 01:58:27,600
Can I please scroll down?

934
01:58:30,600 --> 01:58:33,600
Tap the... What the fuck are these tap...

935
01:58:33,600 --> 01:58:35,600
These fucking bindings.

936
01:58:44,600 --> 01:58:48,600
I can't even use... I can't even use the buttons on the side of my mouse.

937
01:58:48,600 --> 01:58:51,600
Oh, Jesus fuck.

938
01:58:55,600 --> 01:58:57,600
Turn the arm on, see it.

939
01:59:00,600 --> 01:59:02,600
Okay.

940
01:59:17,600 --> 01:59:20,600
I feel like it's a little bit better.

941
01:59:23,600 --> 01:59:25,600
No, it's not.

942
01:59:26,600 --> 01:59:29,600
The dodge is better but the attack isn't.

943
01:59:30,600 --> 01:59:32,600
Okay.

944
01:59:36,600 --> 01:59:40,600
No, literally when you turn on this game it says it's best with a controller.

945
01:59:43,600 --> 01:59:47,600
Have you considered simply getting good as the kids say?

946
01:59:47,600 --> 01:59:50,600
You're only as good as your equipment.

947
01:59:50,600 --> 01:59:51,600
That's what they say.

948
01:59:51,600 --> 01:59:53,600
Skins equals wins.

949
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:55,600
Counter strike.

950
01:59:55,600 --> 01:59:59,600
My need to assign it the mouse down column to the keyboard one.

951
02:00:03,600 --> 02:00:05,600
Let me try that.

952
02:00:08,600 --> 02:00:12,600
Because I'll play with keyboard if that works, if it's better then.

953
02:00:22,600 --> 02:00:24,600
Actually...

954
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:27,600
...

955
02:00:33,600 --> 02:00:35,600
Jesus fuck.

956
02:00:45,600 --> 02:00:48,600
You always run faster with a knife.

957
02:00:49,600 --> 02:00:51,600
Boobs counts as equip.

958
02:00:51,600 --> 02:00:53,600
Holy moly.

959
02:00:54,600 --> 02:00:56,600
Yes, you like my equipment?

960
02:00:56,600 --> 02:00:59,600
You like my equipment?

961
02:01:13,600 --> 02:01:16,600
Actually, I would prefer...

962
02:01:17,600 --> 02:01:19,600
...

963
02:01:20,600 --> 02:01:23,600
... because I'm thinking about how I play...

964
02:01:24,600 --> 02:01:26,600
... FPS games.

965
02:01:26,600 --> 02:01:28,600
...

966
02:01:43,600 --> 02:01:46,600
The fuck was left control being used for?

967
02:01:48,600 --> 02:01:50,600
Heal, that's fine.

968
02:01:50,600 --> 02:01:52,600
F, that's fine.

969
02:01:52,600 --> 02:01:54,600
Shell spell.

970
02:01:57,600 --> 02:02:00,600
Okay, I was going to use Q for that, but Q's already there.

971
02:02:01,600 --> 02:02:03,600
Hammer.

972
02:02:04,600 --> 02:02:06,600
Folk, oh, focus.

973
02:02:07,600 --> 02:02:09,600
What the fuck, hammer?

974
02:02:13,600 --> 02:02:16,600
What the fuck is C being used for?

975
02:02:17,600 --> 02:02:20,600
C's not being used for anything, am I blind?

976
02:02:26,600 --> 02:02:28,600
...

977
02:02:39,600 --> 02:02:41,600
God, why the fuck am I...

978
02:02:41,600 --> 02:02:43,600
Why is my eye burning?

979
02:02:52,600 --> 02:02:54,600
That's not what I fucking pressed!

980
02:02:54,600 --> 02:02:56,600
No!

981
02:03:05,600 --> 02:03:07,600
Actually...

982
02:03:11,600 --> 02:03:13,600
Yeah, whatever.

983
02:03:18,600 --> 02:03:21,600
It doesn't have any, like, mouse sensitivity.

984
02:03:22,600 --> 02:03:24,600
Oh, turn that off.

985
02:03:24,600 --> 02:03:26,600
Everything's off!

986
02:03:33,600 --> 02:03:35,600
What?

987
02:03:36,600 --> 02:03:38,600
Oh, my fucking god.

988
02:03:44,600 --> 02:03:47,600
It took the mouse right thing as, like...

989
02:03:48,600 --> 02:03:52,600
I can't move my fucking camera, even though I didn't press mouse right.

990
02:03:54,600 --> 02:03:56,600
Shell spell on C?

991
02:03:58,600 --> 02:04:00,600
I really want some crab legs now.

992
02:04:08,600 --> 02:04:11,600
Please, for the love of god, let me move down.

993
02:04:18,600 --> 02:04:20,600
Oh.

994
02:04:23,600 --> 02:04:25,600
What?

995
02:04:29,600 --> 02:04:32,600
Just because I moved my mouse to the...

996
02:04:33,600 --> 02:04:35,600
Jesus.

997
02:04:36,600 --> 02:04:38,600
What is m-

998
02:04:39,600 --> 02:04:41,600
What?

999
02:04:41,600 --> 02:04:43,600
What?

1000
02:04:48,600 --> 02:04:50,600
Game is weird.

1001
02:04:55,600 --> 02:04:57,600
Okay.

1002
02:04:58,600 --> 02:05:00,600
Let me just...

1003
02:05:08,600 --> 02:05:10,600
I put...

1004
02:05:11,600 --> 02:05:15,600
I don't like using keyboard in a game like this,

1005
02:05:15,600 --> 02:05:18,600
because I literally... it takes me forever to, like, get the...

1006
02:05:18,600 --> 02:05:20,600
bindings I want.

1007
02:05:22,600 --> 02:05:24,600
Why is that?

1008
02:05:24,600 --> 02:05:26,600
It was using this as a sprint.

1009
02:05:36,600 --> 02:05:38,600
Okay.

1010
02:05:41,600 --> 02:05:43,600
Okay, whatever.

1011
02:05:46,600 --> 02:05:48,600
You guys, you guys hang in there?

1012
02:05:48,600 --> 02:05:51,600
Do you have a controller plugged into a USB header,

1013
02:05:51,600 --> 02:05:53,600
in the case of the motherboard?

1014
02:05:53,600 --> 02:05:55,600
It's on the motherboard,

1015
02:05:55,600 --> 02:05:57,600
and it's USB-C it's plugged into,

1016
02:05:57,600 --> 02:05:59,600
so that's why I'm like, what the fuck?

1017
02:06:02,600 --> 02:06:04,600
Ooh, give me that.

1018
02:06:16,600 --> 02:06:19,600
You know what I should have done? I should have leveled up.

1019
02:06:24,600 --> 02:06:26,600
Can I go back to that moonshell?

1020
02:06:31,600 --> 02:06:34,600
You guys are chilling? You're dead? I'm so sorry.

1021
02:06:34,600 --> 02:06:36,600
No loss.

1022
02:06:36,600 --> 02:06:38,600
No loss there.

1023
02:06:39,600 --> 02:06:41,600
No one will miss you.

1024
02:06:45,600 --> 02:06:47,600
Okay.

1025
02:06:51,600 --> 02:06:53,600
PC of Bluetooth.

1026
02:06:53,600 --> 02:06:55,600
I don't think it does.

1027
02:06:55,600 --> 02:06:59,600
I feel like even if it was Bluetooth, it wouldn't make a difference.

1028
02:07:15,600 --> 02:07:17,600
If I...

1029
02:07:22,600 --> 02:07:24,600
If I...

1030
02:07:30,600 --> 02:07:33,600
So I have to go to the lady to do my skill tree?

1031
02:07:37,600 --> 02:07:39,600
Yes, for sure.

1032
02:07:39,600 --> 02:07:41,600
Hello.

1033
02:07:42,600 --> 02:07:44,600
I don't think a spirit could type,

1034
02:07:44,600 --> 02:07:47,600
but well, maybe if it's a talented spirit.

1035
02:07:52,600 --> 02:07:54,600
You have steam input enabled?

1036
02:07:55,600 --> 02:07:57,600
I don't know.

1037
02:08:02,600 --> 02:08:04,600
I don't know where that setting would be.

1038
02:08:05,600 --> 02:08:08,600
I usually... I've never had that enabled that I know of.

1039
02:08:08,600 --> 02:08:10,600
I don't need to talk to you, I just need to...

1040
02:08:11,600 --> 02:08:13,600
Do I need to talk to you to upgrade stuff?

1041
02:08:14,600 --> 02:08:16,600
Am I just going here to do that?

1042
02:08:20,600 --> 02:08:22,600
No?

1043
02:08:23,600 --> 02:08:25,600
Okay, I guess I have to talk to you.

1044
02:08:27,600 --> 02:08:29,600
I guess you're the Sophia in this game.

1045
02:08:38,600 --> 02:08:40,600
Oh!

1046
02:08:42,600 --> 02:08:44,600
Cool.

1047
02:08:48,600 --> 02:08:50,600
That's pretty smart.

1048
02:08:55,600 --> 02:08:57,600
Fashion night in?

1049
02:09:06,600 --> 02:09:10,600
Hmm, these are all really good skills to use.

1050
02:09:11,600 --> 02:09:13,600
Yeah.

1051
02:09:17,600 --> 02:09:19,600
That's cool, actually.

1052
02:09:22,600 --> 02:09:25,600
I think I might do the free...

1053
02:09:25,600 --> 02:09:27,600
Actually, I'll do that, yeah.

1054
02:09:32,600 --> 02:09:34,600
I hate playing on keyboard, though.

1055
02:09:35,600 --> 02:09:37,600
Phew.

1056
02:09:38,600 --> 02:09:40,600
You have the same utility disabled it?

1057
02:09:40,600 --> 02:09:42,600
Oh.

1058
02:09:43,600 --> 02:09:45,600
Pushing to Bluetooth, which I helped you.

1059
02:09:46,600 --> 02:09:48,600
Where is this... where is steam input?

1060
02:09:48,600 --> 02:09:50,600
Where would that setting be?

1061
02:09:51,600 --> 02:09:52,600
Sorry, I'm stupid.

1062
02:09:52,600 --> 02:09:53,600
Sorry, I'm blonde.

1063
02:09:53,600 --> 02:09:55,600
Where would this be input setting be?

1064
02:10:04,600 --> 02:10:06,600
Hmm.

1065
02:10:19,600 --> 02:10:21,600
Oh, shit, I just realized what time it was.

1066
02:10:25,600 --> 02:10:30,600
I am gonna end it here for now.

1067
02:10:31,600 --> 02:10:34,600
I think Amy's on doing stuff.

1068
02:10:35,600 --> 02:10:37,600
Let me save.

1069
02:10:43,600 --> 02:10:46,600
I don't know if I'm gonna keep playing this game.

1070
02:10:48,600 --> 02:10:52,600
The whole thing with the controls is kind of irritating.

1071
02:10:53,600 --> 02:10:55,600
But if you guys really want me to continue...

1072
02:10:55,600 --> 02:11:03,600
Oh, yeah, she's designing a 2.0 outfit or something.

1073
02:11:07,600 --> 02:11:09,600
And then...

1074
02:11:09,600 --> 02:11:11,600
Bye, big sis.

1075
02:11:11,600 --> 02:11:13,600
Yeah, I'm gonna send you to little sis.

1076
02:11:21,600 --> 02:11:23,600
I was just starting to enjoy this.

1077
02:11:23,600 --> 02:11:24,600
Damn.

1078
02:11:24,600 --> 02:11:26,600
If you guys really want me to continue it, I will.

1079
02:11:28,600 --> 02:11:31,600
It's like clamoring for it.

1080
02:11:32,600 --> 02:11:33,600
Maybe I will.

1081
02:11:33,600 --> 02:11:34,600
I don't know.

1082
02:11:34,600 --> 02:11:36,600
I probably won't play it next week, maybe the week after.

1083
02:11:37,600 --> 02:11:39,600
I like the game.

1084
02:11:39,600 --> 02:11:44,600
Again, I don't like being irritated and frustrated with the game's mechanics on stream.

1085
02:11:47,600 --> 02:11:48,600
Maybe a gun run?

1086
02:11:48,600 --> 02:11:50,600
No, that'd be too fucking easy.

1087
02:11:50,600 --> 02:11:54,600
I don't want to make it easy.

1088
02:11:54,600 --> 02:12:01,600
I'm generally mad that I killed the Duchess in one shot.

1089
02:12:03,600 --> 02:12:07,600
I thought it would take at least two, three, or four or five shots.

1090
02:12:09,600 --> 02:12:11,600
I feel like such a fucking dirty cheater.

1091
02:12:11,600 --> 02:12:12,600
I'm mad at myself.

1092
02:12:12,600 --> 02:12:24,600
Just like when the weird bug that the first boss you fight just disappeared on me and didn't show back up.

1093
02:12:25,600 --> 02:12:27,600
And everybody treated it like I killed it.

1094
02:12:27,600 --> 02:12:29,600
But I'm like, he just leapt.

1095
02:12:29,600 --> 02:12:31,600
He didn't want to talk to me anymore.

1096
02:12:32,600 --> 02:12:34,600
What the fuck is on my arm?

1097
02:12:38,600 --> 02:12:41,600
Yeah, the controls are rushing.

1098
02:12:42,600 --> 02:12:43,600
That's the most anticlimactic.

1099
02:12:43,600 --> 02:12:44,600
What do you think that happened?

1100
02:12:44,600 --> 02:12:45,600
I know.

1101
02:12:45,600 --> 02:12:46,600
I'm like, okay.

1102
02:12:46,600 --> 02:12:48,600
I was like righty coming up with another strat.

1103
02:12:48,600 --> 02:12:52,600
I'm like, okay, I just got to like bring him in a circle, be able to jump in a can for a shell.

1104
02:12:52,600 --> 02:12:54,600
And then he just never showed up.

1105
02:12:54,600 --> 02:12:57,600
He never showed up for the fight.

1106
02:12:57,600 --> 02:12:59,600
I fear you're a maiden list.

1107
02:13:00,600 --> 02:13:03,600
I don't have any sort of maiden list behavior.

1108
02:13:05,600 --> 02:13:06,600
Downloading.

1109
02:13:06,600 --> 02:13:07,600
I'm lost to my phone right now.

1110
02:13:07,600 --> 02:13:08,600
Also hi, hi.

1111
02:13:12,600 --> 02:13:13,600
Yeah, going on and off.

1112
02:13:13,600 --> 02:13:15,600
Like, yeah, I might play this a little bit on the side.

1113
02:13:15,600 --> 02:13:17,600
I have Sekiro.

1114
02:13:17,600 --> 02:13:18,600
Heroes die twice.

1115
02:13:18,600 --> 02:13:19,600
So maybe I'll play that.

1116
02:13:19,600 --> 02:13:22,600
I'm trying to think of some games to play for next week.

1117
02:13:24,600 --> 02:13:26,600
I'm thinking about doing some collabs next week.

1118
02:13:26,600 --> 02:13:27,600
It's frustrating.

1119
02:13:27,600 --> 02:13:33,600
I have to miss out on a possible collab with the girls next week because I have to work at my normal job again.

1120
02:13:35,600 --> 02:13:36,600
Sekiro, yeah, I only got.

1121
02:13:36,600 --> 02:13:40,600
So Sekiro was the first friend like Soulslight game I ever played.

1122
02:13:40,600 --> 02:13:43,600
And I didn't know what Soulslikes were like.

1123
02:13:43,600 --> 02:13:45,600
I didn't know it was a Soulslight.

1124
02:13:45,600 --> 02:13:48,600
I didn't, I didn't, I never had played Dark Souls or anything.

1125
02:13:49,600 --> 02:14:02,600
And I remember, like, I never got past the first boss, like the first duty fight, because I was, I was just getting so pissed and angry.

1126
02:14:02,600 --> 02:14:03,600
I'm like.

1127
02:14:06,600 --> 02:14:07,600
Thank you, Mama.

1128
02:14:10,600 --> 02:14:12,600
I'm glad you liked it. It was kind of funny.

1129
02:14:12,600 --> 02:14:14,600
I can't, I want a clip of that.

1130
02:14:15,600 --> 02:14:19,600
Just like of me getting the gun and being like, wait, let's see how this works.

1131
02:14:19,600 --> 02:14:21,600
And just fucking one shot.

1132
02:14:22,600 --> 02:14:23,600
It's good.

1133
02:14:25,600 --> 02:14:26,600
Play Dark Souls too.

1134
02:14:26,600 --> 02:14:27,600
Yeah.

1135
02:14:27,600 --> 02:14:29,600
Yeah, let me know what, like, I also have Liza P.

1136
02:14:29,600 --> 02:14:32,600
I wouldn't mind playing through Liza P again.

1137
02:14:32,600 --> 02:14:33,600
On stream.

1138
02:14:35,600 --> 02:14:37,600
That's a game I really enjoyed.

1139
02:14:40,600 --> 02:14:41,600
Yeah.

1140
02:14:43,600 --> 02:14:45,600
Curl becoming an American moment.

1141
02:14:45,600 --> 02:14:50,600
I wish there was like dialogue, though, like when you added that, like when you got, when you got the gun.

1142
02:14:52,600 --> 02:14:54,600
I wish you would like, say something.

1143
02:14:54,600 --> 02:14:58,600
Like, really, really, like, really awkwardly political.

1144
02:15:00,600 --> 02:15:05,600
Like, they may get my taxes, but they'll never take my gun right away.

1145
02:15:05,600 --> 02:15:07,600
There's some shit like that.

1146
02:15:07,600 --> 02:15:08,600
Play Doom.

1147
02:15:08,600 --> 02:15:10,600
The new Doom game that's coming out looks good.

1148
02:15:10,600 --> 02:15:13,600
I, like, I, I was like, holy shit, that looks good.

1149
02:15:13,600 --> 02:15:15,600
I haven't, I've never played Doom.

1150
02:15:15,600 --> 02:15:17,600
I've never played Doom.

1151
02:15:17,600 --> 02:15:18,600
I've never played Doom.

1152
02:15:18,600 --> 02:15:19,600
I've never played Doom.

1153
02:15:19,600 --> 02:15:21,600
I've never played Doom.

1154
02:15:21,600 --> 02:15:23,600
I was like, holy shit, that looks good.

1155
02:15:23,600 --> 02:15:24,600
I have, I've never played Doom.

1156
02:15:24,600 --> 02:15:25,600
I'll be honest with you.

1157
02:15:25,600 --> 02:15:26,600
I've never played a Doom game.

1158
02:15:26,600 --> 02:15:28,600
I've always wanted to play a Doom game.

1159
02:15:28,600 --> 02:15:31,600
My dad, I think, played the OG Doom game.

1160
02:15:32,600 --> 02:15:38,600
I've watched people play Doom, and I do like, shoot him up.

1161
02:15:39,600 --> 02:15:42,600
This should make us be gonna make sure we text an accent.

1162
02:15:42,600 --> 02:15:43,600
Yeah.

1163
02:15:43,600 --> 02:15:45,600
Peak America is Texas.

1164
02:15:45,600 --> 02:15:50,600
Can't wait for that state to just secede from our country and become the country of Texas.

1165
02:15:51,600 --> 02:15:52,600
Or something.

1166
02:15:53,600 --> 02:15:57,600
I don't care who the IRS is saying, I'm not paying my taxes.

1167
02:15:57,600 --> 02:15:59,600
It's fucking WAPOW.

1168
02:15:59,600 --> 02:16:01,600
Shoot some.

1169
02:16:01,600 --> 02:16:03,600
Hell yeah, brother.

1170
02:16:04,600 --> 02:16:08,600
Okay, let me make sure my redirect's good, and I'll send you on over to Sweet Emmy.

1171
02:16:08,600 --> 02:16:16,600
Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom, Doom.

1172
02:16:16,600 --> 02:16:17,600
Yay.

1173
02:16:19,600 --> 02:16:20,600
Okay, that is cool.

1174
02:16:22,600 --> 02:16:23,600
Designing group 2.0.

1175
02:16:23,600 --> 02:16:29,600
I love how the thumbnail is Twilight Sparkle yelling at something.

1176
02:16:29,600 --> 02:16:40,600
I might be, I'm cooking something behind the scenes for my 2.0.

1177
02:16:41,600 --> 02:16:44,600
Actually, it's not even a 2.0, it's more of a 1.5.

1178
02:16:45,600 --> 02:16:51,600
But that won't be for until maybe next year.

1179
02:16:52,600 --> 02:16:59,600
No, maybe it'll be a 2.5 if I get a 2.0 by like the end of the year.

1180
02:17:00,600 --> 02:17:01,600
I don't know.

1181
02:17:01,600 --> 02:17:02,600
Who knows?

1182
02:17:02,600 --> 02:17:04,600
I do like this model.

1183
02:17:05,600 --> 02:17:07,600
I mostly just want more toggles.

1184
02:17:07,600 --> 02:17:14,600
And I was telling Azura pointed out that we actually are missing a vowel when we talk.

1185
02:17:14,600 --> 02:17:22,600
Which is, because you got A, E, I, O, U, but U doesn't work.

1186
02:17:22,600 --> 02:17:26,600
So I do U, U, U, my mouth isn't open.

1187
02:17:28,600 --> 02:17:29,600
So it's weird.

1188
02:17:31,600 --> 02:17:34,600
Yeah, Nari did a great job rigging.

1189
02:17:37,600 --> 02:17:38,600
Yeah.

1190
02:17:41,600 --> 02:17:43,600
Gould did a great job designing.

1191
02:17:45,600 --> 02:17:49,600
Well, thank you for the tips guys.

1192
02:17:51,600 --> 02:17:55,600
I hope you have a great rest of your day or night and hanging out with Emmy.

1193
02:17:56,600 --> 02:18:03,600
I also hope you suck a dick because, you know, you're trash and all, so.

1194
02:18:04,600 --> 02:18:06,600
It's all that trash is good for.

1195
02:18:07,600 --> 02:18:08,600
Sucking peepie.

1196
02:18:09,600 --> 02:18:10,600
Lots of love.

1197
02:18:10,600 --> 02:18:11,600
XOXO.

1198
02:18:11,600 --> 02:18:13,600
Madam Sheeby.

1199
02:18:38,600 --> 02:18:40,600
You guys still smell bad though.

I'm sorry.

1217
02:18:58,600 --> 02:18:59,600
I'm sorry.

1218
02:18:59,600 --> 02:19:00,600
I'm sorry.
