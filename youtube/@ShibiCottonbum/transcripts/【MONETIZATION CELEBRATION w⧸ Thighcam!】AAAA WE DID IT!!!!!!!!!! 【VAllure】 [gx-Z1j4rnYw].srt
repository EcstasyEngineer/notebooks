I'm brown, so if you didn't know that already, that's why I'm tan.

31
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,600
I need to sneeze.

32
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,600
Oh, that felt funny.

33
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:21,600
I'm also, you know, I'm, let me just, I'm wearing my lovely necklace.

34
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,600
Thank you. I'm gonna be sneezing a lot because I've had allergies all day.

35
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,600
I'll only pull my shorts down a little bit, so it's obvious I'm wearing pants.

36
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,600
Yes, I'm wearing a Doctor Strange shirt that looks like a tarot card.

37
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,600
Some of you also may know that I'm a Marvel nerd.

38
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,600
And I'm wearing a hoodie because I got really cold.

39
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,600
Thank you. I don't have my headphones on.

40
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:53,600
And I, hold on. I'm a mess. I'm literally such a...

41
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:59,600
I'm like so overwhelmed right now.

42
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,600
Bless you. Thank you.

43
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:09,600
Thank you Namesword for the 50. Jesus Christ.

44
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,600
Okay, I might also just save tips till the end as well.

45
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,600
So we're gonna do that. I'm gonna save tips for the end as well.

46
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,600
How's the party? It was good.

47
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,600
I came to bargain.

48
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,600
So my friend Olive, I've talked about before, she is leaving the job that we work at.

49
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:37,600
So she had a bunch of like our coworkers and people that used to work at the place we work at.

50
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,600
Over and we had a little barbecue.

51
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:46,600
I might have had a Margar too, you know, got a spoil myself.

52
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,600
And though I realized I shouldn't have really done that because

53
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,600
I regretting it today.

54
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,600
I'm like, I'm only a lightweight because of the medication I'm on.

55
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,600
Because I'm on like several different medications for pain management.

56
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,600
And also mentally with no way.

57
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,600
And I need to make sure like...

58
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,600
So I had like one and then I had like...

59
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,600
Actually, did I have one or two?

60
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,600
I think I only had like one and I took a sip of another but I never finished it.

61
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,600
But yeah, I get I'm a major lightweight.

62
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,600
I also just don't like to drink alcohol a lot.

63
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:28,600
I literally have only done it for stream and then rarely when I usually I'll just like...

64
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,600
I was drinking ginger ale after that chilling.

65
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:36,600
Also don't be surprised what that's normal.

66
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,600
I'm so overwhelmed right now.

67
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,600
And that's why I'm like I'm being very got mo because I'm just like...

68
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,600
I'm also very self conscious.

69
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:52,600
I'm very appreciative of S.R.I.S.M.C. The Night Out.

70
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,600
I'm usually...

71
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:01,600
I'm against showing skin but because this is a special occasion.

72
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,600
I'll probably only ever do handcams.

73
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,600
You probably won't see my thighs for a while.

74
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,600
Unless I have like a cat cam on.

75
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:15,600
And then I'm the camera might get like knocked over by like Bumi or Fia.

76
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,600
Bumi is actually by my feet right now.

77
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,600
But yeah, I'm happy you guys enjoyed those.

78
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,600
Hopefully I don't delete him later out of...

79
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,600
I can't talk because I'm very stuffed stuffy.

80
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,600
Ooh, these are like this is like a bird treat.

81
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,600
But okay, we're going to go through these snacks.

82
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,600
And I'm going to determine what I like and I don't like.

83
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,600
YouTube might delete it.

84
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,600
I definitely have my...

85
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,600
I was debating whether or not for like certain doughnose.

86
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,600
I like, you know, beat your ass or something.

87
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,600
But who knows?

88
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,600
Rare thighs, yes, they're very rare.

89
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,600
Because like I'm someone like a VTuber is a VTuber.

90
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:17,600
Like I don't like breaking immersion unless it's for a special occasion.

91
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,600
And you know, today's a special occasion is Bumi name.

92
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,600
Yes, Bumi is Bumi King of Amashu.

93
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,600
But thank you guys so much for remembering already.

94
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,600
I'm very overwhelmed with like how many members.

95
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,600
Feed us please.

96
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,600
Yes, I'll feed you.

97
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,600
Yeah, I can understand I wanted to do also.

98
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,600
Yeah, yeah, like I used to be a flash streamer.

99
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,600
But like I just...

100
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,600
I didn't do stuff like this when I was like it wasn't did not do stuff like this.

101
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:53,600
I was a very say so person when I flash streamed honestly.

102
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,600
Minus like being toxic in like counter strike.

103
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,600
I don't know.

104
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,600
Thank you for the number.

105
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,600
But I didn't think I would get monetized.

106
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,600
And honestly my heart goes out to Azura who is also being hated on by YouTube.

107
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,600
I get limited ads on everything and then I get adult restrictions.

108
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,600
I'm definitely going to change.

109
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,600
I'm actually going to probably do that right now.

110
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:24,600
I'm going to just edit my thumbnail to something else.

111
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:36,600
I'm going to take my greasy little toes out of there.

112
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:42,600
Yeah, I know Azura they need to cut Azura break.

113
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,600
It's it was pissing me off.

114
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,600
Like how I'm like I'm like cut off my tits.

115
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,600
Just do it.

116
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,600
Just do it.

117
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,600
I just cut off our tits just so we can get monetization.

118
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,600
I'll just do feet.

119
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,600
Feet in the thumbnail.

120
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,600
Forget boobs in the thumbnail.

121
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,600
Feet in the thumbnail.

122
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,600
I'm trying to look for a good pair of feet to smack on this.

123
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,600
I took like several feet pictures.

124
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,600
I'll do high feet and feet in high heels.

125
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,600
Oh, where'd it go?

126
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,600
Canva feet.

127
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:39,600
I was I'm wishing I left because manage it was just like do you want me to send over to the graphic artists like like do you want me to have them make you thumbnail.

128
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:47,600
I'm like no no I got it because I'm like I'm not going to send my feet pics to the graphic artists and be like hey can you like slam this in here.

129
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,600
I'm pretty sure Emmie also like edited her own.

130
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,600
Feet in high.

131
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,600
Oh perfect.

132
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,600
Perfect.

133
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,600
These are these are the perfect ones.

134
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,600
Okay, let me save this and download.

135
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,600
We love to see it.

136
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,600
Okay, let me just change the thumbnail.

137
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,600
Can you put straight?

138
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,600
You want me to put doctor straight?

139
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,600
No.

140
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:27,600
Like Marvel will come out of nowhere and just like attack me.

141
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,600
Perfect.

142
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,600
Oh, you know, I should have probably covered my boobies as well.

143
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,600
Whatever.

144
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,600
I'll do that later.

145
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,600
It's not the point.

146
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,600
It's not why we're here today.

147
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,600
You know, we're here.

148
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:52,600
We're gathered together today to celebrate monetization of this channel.

149
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,600
I can't get back to my chat with them.

150
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,600
I can't see what you guys are saying.

151
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,600
There we go.

152
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,600
No, I can see what the fuck you guys are saying.

153
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,600
Those are fine.

154
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,600
It's your boobla.

155
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,600
Oh, fucking hell, bro.

156
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,600
Fucking hell.

157
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,600
I'll fuck around with that later.

158
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,600
Yeah, whatever.

159
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,600
We're here to party.

160
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,600
Okay, so let me open this up.

161
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,600
This one's different from the other one I just had.

162
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,600
You're too weak.

163
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,600
Oppa!

164
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,600
This one is strawberry flavored.

165
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,600
Ooh, that's good.

166
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,600
With my palm.

167
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,600
I always do it with my thumbs.

168
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,600
I don't know.

169
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,600
These are calling my name, so I want to eat them.

170
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,600
Oh, wait.

171
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,600
Hi, Rena.

172
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,600
Everybody, this is Rena.

173
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,600
Say hello.

174
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,600
Where?

175
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,600
Wait, what did I just do with the pamphlet?

176
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,600
I can't pick this up.

177
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,600
Okay, so this.

178
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,600
It doesn't say what it is.

179
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,600
Oh, this is a cocky pee.

180
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,600
Cocky pee.

181
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,600
Excuse me.

182
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,600
A Carmen bar smack in Japan.

183
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,600
Oh, then mercy will probably like these.

184
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,600
I'm mercy cosplaying today with my scissors.

185
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,600
Just, you know.

186
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:57,600
I'm a small crescent shaped fragments of Senbei with a little bit of spice and peanuts.

187
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,600
Spicy rice crackers and nuts is the flavor.

188
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,600
You can see it right here.

189
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,600
Cocky pee.

190
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,600
Cocky pee.

191
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,600
I...

192
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,600
If somebody just give 50...

193
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,600
What the fuck?

194
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,600
Hello?

195
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,600
Jesus Christ!

196
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,600
Jesus Christ!

197
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,600
Oh my god, thank you!

198
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,600
Free cat.

199
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,600
E-giggle chat.

200
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,600
I'm gonna take like one bite of everything.

201
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,600
I'm not gonna eat them all.

202
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,600
Hope you guys...

203
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,600
I hope some of you guys got blessed.

204
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,600
But I'm gonna have one of each.

205
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,600
Okay, that's a peanut.

206
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,600
It's pretty good.

207
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,600
I need like a pile of good and bad.

208
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,600
Everything good is gonna be on gushin.

209
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,600
I love like Japanese savory snacks.

210
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,600
In fact, I might like separate them.

211
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,600
I got clickbaited.

212
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,600
Wait, is Mercy here?

213
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,600
I can't see.

214
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,600
If Mercy's here, thank you!

215
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,600
Jeez.

216
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,600
Dude, what?

217
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,600
Another 50.

218
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:40,600
I guess you shall have some toes for that.

219
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,600
There's the covered in cat hair, don't worry about it.

220
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,600
Okay, let's try this.

221
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,600
Jesus, congrats. I love you, Mercy.

222
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,600
Thank you.

223
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,600
Shnifa, shnifa.

224
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,600
Okay.

225
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,600
This is kaiofumi.

226
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,600
Translating to flavor Kyoto.

227
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,600
These uniquely Japanese snacks have been around for over 200 years.

228
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,600
Created with high quality millet and rice.

229
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:14,600
Okoshi are an okasa specialty known as luck bringing the sweet.

230
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,600
Wait, that's a sweet?

231
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,600
Sometimes the packaging is different.

232
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,600
You get free.

233
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,600
Maybe, I don't know. Maybe if I'm feeling nice.

234
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:41,600
It sucks cause like I'm still a little bit like nauseous and queasy from like three days ago.

235
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,600
This is like bird food.

236
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:10,600
There's a flavor in this but I can't place in it but I don't like it.

237
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,600
Like it's not bad but it's like it's not good.

238
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,600
I'm gonna put this off to the side.

239
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,600
It does not taste like a rice krispie treat.

240
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,600
Oh my god, my cats are like running around.

241
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,600
What is this?

242
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,600
I'm trying to find the savory stuff first.

243
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,600
Ooh, these are tasty.

244
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,600
It's amazing.

245
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,600
My like microphone might sound a little bit bad because it's like behind me.

246
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,600
Cause like I have an L shaped desk and like this is, you can't see.

247
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,600
Over there is where my microphone is.

248
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,600
It's like over my shoulder.

249
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,600
It looks good but it didn't taste that good.

250
00:18:53,600 --> 00:19:00,600
These are Happy Turn, a pack of mini soft rice crackers with a sweet and sour seasoning for deliciousness that does not stop.

251
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,600
Deliciousness that does not stop.

252
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,600
L shaped butt.

253
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,600
That's why I have scissors.

254
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,600
Shiba mouse, like mouse pad.

255
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,600
Ooh, these smell weird.

256
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,600
Welcome to my channel.

257
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,600
Today we're going to be trying this new makeup product.

258
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,600
This isn't bad. I like these.

259
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,600
They're not sweet and sour though. They're just sweet.

260
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,600
These look like Doritos.

261
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,600
I feel like I dropped one.

262
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,600
I guess not.

263
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,600
I can't open this.

264
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,600
Ooh, little baby Doritos.

265
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,600
Wait.

266
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,600
What are these?

267
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,600
What are these? What are these? What are these?

268
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,600
What the fuck are they?

269
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,600
These are triangle crackers.

270
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:48,600
Cute triangle shaped bite sized crackers with a salty nori seaweed flavor. Wow.

271
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,600
What are those? They're pretty good though.

272
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,600
I'm going to...

273
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,600
They don't taste like seaweed.

274
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,600
They don't taste like seaweed though.

275
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,600
I like them.

276
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,600
I already know. This is my favorite Japanese snack.

277
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,600
I'm going to take one bite, but I'm going to destroy this after stream.

278
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,600
I'm telling you that right now.

279
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,600
Happy Sunday. Happy Sunday.

280
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,600
I know it's Father's Day.

281
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,600
Shout out to my dad. That's a Chad.

282
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,600
Hold on. What is this called again? I forget.

283
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,600
Those are the giant.

284
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,600
Yes, they're so good. High Serenity. They're so fucking good.

285
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,600
Big pippe.

286
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,600
This is Omibode. This is sticks. Crispy hollow tube corn puff sticks.

287
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:09,600
This one. I don't know what flavor it is, but I'm just going to eat it.

288
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,600
Oh.

289
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,600
This is so good.

290
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,600
Thank you Serenity.

291
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,600
Speaking of which, my parent.

292
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,600
That goes in the tasty pile.

293
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,600
You guys know that my dad wasn't feeling so good the other day.

294
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:49,600
You guys were very nice enough and you guys donated around $200 to my parents.

295
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,600
Just to be like, hey, I hope their parents are okay.

296
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:58,600
I decided I'm not going to take that because I just told you a story about my dad being sick.

297
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,600
I'm going to be like, thank you pocket money.

298
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,600
No, I gave it to my parents. I took them out for breakfast yesterday.

299
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,600
My dad and my mom got so much food because of me.

300
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:12,600
They were just like, we haven't eaten out like this is such a long time.

301
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:17,600
And then I literally, this is before we sat down too.

302
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,600
I literally was making a joke.

303
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,600
I'm like, dad, you know how I always ask you for your cut?

304
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:31,600
Because you take credit for my reading comprehension and my ability to do voices.

305
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,600
He's like, yeah, because it's true.

306
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,600
And so I like just whipped out like $200.

307
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,600
And I just was like, here you guys go.

308
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,600
This is from my streaming fans.

309
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,600
And they're just like, what?

310
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,600
And I was like, here you go.

311
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,600
And my dad, like my parents mouths dropped.

312
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,600
My mom was just like, she looked like she was about to cry.

313
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,600
She's like, no way.

314
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,600
She's like, what the fuck?

315
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:01,600
It's like, I wish I recorded it, but like, I'm not going to record my parents without their consent.

316
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,600
And they were like, and they went out like they were so thankful guys.

317
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,600
So like, thank you.

318
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:13,600
They went out to one of their favorite like areas near our city.

319
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,600
And as like a little date, because they haven't been able to kind of just like go out.

320
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,600
My dad's like, your mom's looking so cute.

321
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,600
I just want to bring her out somewhere.

322
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,600
I'm like, do it.

323
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,600
And so yeah, they like had a little good time.

324
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,600
So thank you guys.

325
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,600
My dad's doing a lot better.

326
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:37,600
My mom has been kind of sad because, you know, she doesn't have a job anymore, but she's been saying busy with the gardening.

327
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:44,600
I was telling her, like both of my parents will be like so psyched to like come on for like a recorded video or something.

328
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:48,600
And or my dad said, he's like, just say the word and we'll play like some cod together.

329
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,600
And I'm like, nobody's going to watch it, at least like not for me.

330
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:57,600

They don't care.

347
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,600

00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,600

I was just like, they knew that we didn't go to celebrate because I'm a successful whore.

371
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:09,600
We went on to celebrate because they've known I wanted YouTube partner since I was younger.

372
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,600
And I remember I was saying it to my dad.

373
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:17,600
And he's just like, yes, I remember you making your little videos at home being silly.

00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,600
So like, they were just like so proud of me for achieving my dreams, you know?

00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,600
Okay, what's next?

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,600

00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,600
I want to eat this whole thing, but I'm just going to save it.

378
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,600

These are sweet though.

391
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,600
Oh, they're soy sauce flavored.

392
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,600
Here's a little hint of saltiness.

393

These are good.

394
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,600

I haven't gotten a coffin for a long time.

00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,600
I'll get like longer almond shaped nails.

401
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,600
But I can't play games when my nails are long.

402
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,600
Like, I can't.

403
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,600
I can't at all.

404
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,600
So, unless I'm playing with a controller.

00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,600
So, I might forget it.

my mom was telling me a story one time that so my mom would like um model like the shoes that she

632
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:34,160
would get because she like my mom used to be obsessed with shoes um and she was an office

633
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:39,360
woman that's why she also identifies with she be a lot because she was uh she was always assistant

634
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:44,560
to a ceo type thing and um although she should have been running the company to be honest with you

635
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:51,040
um and apparently like some of the people from her office found like her page of like where she

636
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,560
would like show off her shoes and it's because she had really nice feet and then she found out

637
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:59,280
that was on fetish sites and so uh her and my dad had to go get it taken down and then she stopped posting

638
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:06,400
and because my mom didn't know like people were into that

639
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:14,240
okay

640
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:20,080

um lost a check with candy

650
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:34,000
i always thought this candy was cool because i've had this one before um

651
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:39,360
it's almost like if you've ever i don't know if you guys have ever played the card game assassin

652
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:47,120
you um take um like a queen which plays a nurse you take a jack which is like the detective

653
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:53,920
and the ace is the assassin and then there's like um like a king is like the cop

654
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:58,160
and so you have to figure out like which one has the ace who is the assassin and then like this is

655
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:06,080
like the candy equivalent like everybody you're either a um uh just a sweet candy but if you have

656
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:12,720
the sour candy you're like the killer yeah if you yeah help find the suspect each fruity candy

657
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:16,560
starts purple and changes color in your mouth to reveal the guilty or innocent everyone takes

658
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:21,040
a candy and guesses who they think has a sour lemon if you guess correct you make an arrest

659
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:25,680

1089
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:03,680
it's just like it's or like and i say dip probably like dip and like find another job just

1090
01:45:03,680 --> 01:45:11,680
because um streaming wouldn't sustain me although it would be nice but we'll be maybe we'll be full

1091
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:15,360
time eventually um but like

1092
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:22,080
it's just like the place changed i've been there for almost six years

1093
01:45:23,120 --> 01:45:28,000
and it just yeah it's just like changed a lot don't care about their staff anymore so i'm like

1094
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:38,000
i'm outy i'm outy yeah i appreciate you guys so much yeah retail slugs work sucks i know

1095
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:44,560
i guess i've done retail as one month can we watch the princess ride oh yeah we're 100%

1096
01:45:44,560 --> 01:45:49,840
going to watch the princess ride remember it ships streams we do karaoke asmr we're playing

1097
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:54,880
oh yeah i'm probably going to call my asmr stream something else i'm probably not going to

1098
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:59,840
call them asmr streams just because youtube has just hated people who do any sort of asmr

1099
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:06,480
whether you're a fleshy or a fear of youtuber a fleshy sounds like a slur i sh that doesn't

1100
01:46:06,480 --> 01:46:20,480
sound good um if you're a regular human streamer um and or youtuber but so i might call them like

1101
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:29,680
3do roleplays smoothskins it's like a like calling somebody in a knife ear poor elves

1102
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:34,560
youtube is kind of on yeah

1103
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:43,120
so i'll probably call them 3do roleplays or uh audio roleplays um and i'm not like

1104
01:46:43,120 --> 01:46:50,960
really an asmr like i do do asmr but i i'm not i'm still work like i haven't done asmr with

1105
01:46:50,960 --> 01:46:54,960
the 3do before with like triggers and everything i'm used i usually just do whispering and like

1106
01:46:54,960 --> 01:47:02,400
rambling anytime i did asmr but i'm gonna be working on like actually doing asmr oh anonymous
