WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.080
I don't even know if you guys can hear the music.

00:09.080 --> 00:18.280
Alright, I'm back, I'm back even though I got back home earlier than I thought I would.

00:18.280 --> 00:22.720
Thank you guys for your understanding, I'm sorry I had to cut the stream I started initially

00:22.720 --> 00:28.840
short but everything's okay now, everything's good, everybody's good and safe and fine,

00:28.840 --> 00:35.200
I need a tweet, cause I always forget to tweet.

00:35.200 --> 00:41.640
Sorry, hey I was watching that, that just killed me a little bit, hey I was watching

00:41.640 --> 00:43.200
that.

00:43.200 --> 00:49.960
So I had Bulldog Ramen the other day, well like yesterday and my asshole was on fire,

00:49.960 --> 00:56.480
I'm sorry I had to tell you, I just thought you'd like to know you know, so I'm sitting

00:56.480 --> 01:06.960
on an ice cube and hoping for the best, hoping that I won't die, it was so delicious though

01:06.960 --> 01:20.200
so worth it, can I fire a napalm, probably, so you can show us your, hey Oshiba you hope

01:20.200 --> 01:25.800
everything is returning to normal so that you can show us your alpha side, and by the

01:25.800 --> 01:28.560
way don't have to postpone if you choose your sentence, I understand, well thank you, it's

01:28.560 --> 01:34.840
okay now, so silly family stuff that honestly has nothing to do with me but I'm just there

01:34.840 --> 01:41.240
to support in case, again my family is fine, I'm fine, I'm trying to get my fucking headphones

01:41.240 --> 01:53.200
on, oh my gosh, this wire is too short, off this satin water, that's what I get for sitting

01:53.200 --> 01:59.080
on an ice cube, these are my bucks cool man, am I allowed to talk about this, this is already

01:59.080 --> 02:08.040
gone, the thing is already demonetized, whatever, we out here having a great time on this lovely

02:08.040 --> 02:22.400
July evening, good morning, good night, good afternoon, I'm your host Shibi, butt is on

02:22.400 --> 02:47.760
firebomb, I should have said Shibi firebomb but it's fine, okay, I'm alive, whoa, oh god

02:47.760 --> 02:55.240
I can hear myself, can you guys hear me, is it an echo, I just wanted to be able to monitor

02:55.240 --> 03:07.200
my sound, I can hear myself and now there's two of me, two of me, two of me, I'm on a tin

03:07.200 --> 03:16.160
can, whoa that's demonetized, I'm cutting this out, I'm cutting this, the VOD's new,

03:16.560 --> 03:28.800
branding the street now, it ain't a Shibi stream without a little scuff, well of course

03:28.800 --> 03:44.040
this is a great game, you guys hear the music, Shibi bottom fire, that's me, this game looks

03:44.040 --> 03:49.320
wild as fuck because you're right, we're in the wild west baby, I'm just kidding I don't

03:49.320 --> 03:57.080
know, I forget what this takes place in Yellowstone, takes place in the wild Midwest baby, I don't

03:57.080 --> 04:22.000
remember, American school system failed me, kinda, okay I'll turn it up to them, oh, how many

04:22.000 --> 04:28.120
cubs do you cook in, we're gonna have so many cubs, again all the cubs, we're cub maxing the

04:28.120 --> 04:50.040
stream, I hate my life, try to think the only thing about these IEMs is that I can't, like it has

04:50.040 --> 04:54.280
a thing where it should let me turn down the volume with them but it's not letting me do that so

04:54.280 --> 05:04.600
I'm just gonna take one ear out, otherwise I can't hear anything, cub maxing, better call Icy, oh my

05:04.600 --> 05:15.480
god, alright, zitter, let's me tweet, honestly I almost don't feel like tweeting because I'm like if

05:15.480 --> 05:30.440
you know you know, if you know you know, okay we back, I don't know if I could put a link in a

05:30.440 --> 05:40.840
quote tweet but Twitter algorithm is fucking weird as hell, and earlier, we're back earlier,

05:41.640 --> 05:52.320
yeah I initially said six but I realized I was gonna be back sooner, please let me retweet my own

05:52.320 --> 06:12.240
post, thank you, oh my god, okay, so the game might be a little bit laggy because this in my

06:12.240 --> 06:16.800
model just don't play nice, well Quest is kind of notorious for that, it's like one of those games

06:16.800 --> 06:22.160
it just like takes up way too much power than it actually needs to be because it's like a decade

06:22.240 --> 06:29.120
old and it doesn't make any sense, is this considered a retro game, oh god, that just makes me feel bad

06:36.480 --> 06:45.280
furry, shut up Nori, shut up, I love you though, that's my girl Noriko

06:45.600 --> 06:52.160
she probably hates being pointed out now, she doesn't know that I gave her mod

06:54.080 --> 06:55.040
when she wasn't around

07:03.760 --> 07:08.480
she's drawing some very beautiful art of me, am I okay, oh I'm fine, I'm fine, it's just family

07:08.480 --> 07:13.120
stuff but everybody like my immediate family is fine, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good,

07:13.200 --> 07:14.240
I think I'll help my mom or something

07:22.880 --> 07:30.080
where's mountain lion quest, that would be, oh my god, what was that game, oh my god, it was made

07:30.080 --> 07:36.400
by this character called, this person called Kobu and it was like literally like lion simulator

07:36.400 --> 07:42.560
and you can like do some really wacky, oh my god, it's like two hearts, oh my god, it's gonna

07:42.560 --> 07:46.960
bother me but I might play that too at some point, I'm just gonna like, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna

07:46.960 --> 07:54.480
furry max, I'm gonna weasel my way into the furry community, honestly some of the furry models

07:54.480 --> 07:59.920
that I've seen are really freaking cute, I think I saw her a bunny one or like a cat one or a dog

07:59.920 --> 08:07.120
one and I'm like that's actually adorable but it was like Moe, you know, it was cute, she means

08:07.120 --> 08:18.800
becoming a furry, that's the thing, I was always a furry though, I'm always angry, no I'm not a

08:18.800 --> 08:26.480
furry, I do, I do admire the art though, I'm not really into that, like I, I'm trying to think

08:26.480 --> 08:31.520
did I draw, no I only drew like, I never drew like anthropomorphic animals, I only drew like cat

08:31.520 --> 08:39.600
girls or just cats, I never like a combination of like going even deeper in it, she be furry bum,

08:40.240 --> 08:46.080
furry affiliate, oh yeah, no there's definitely, who are all the bunnies furries, I don't know,

08:47.200 --> 08:53.680
ask, ask, I don't know, hey man, does werewolf not count as a furry, I think that's its own thing,

08:55.920 --> 08:58.880
I respect furries a lot because it's not a chief hobby, honestly same

08:59.680 --> 09:05.920
and they make a lot of bank, okay if you, if you complain that my model lags, I'm gonna punch you,

09:05.920 --> 09:11.600
I don't care, it's gonna lag, my computer's old, I built it in 2017, leave me alone,

09:12.640 --> 09:17.760
yes, could a veeler bought me a computer, yeah but I didn't want to ask because I'd rather the

09:17.760 --> 09:26.640
money go towards something else, all right new game, um, I want to modify a wolf,

09:27.760 --> 09:33.040
wait, yeah we're gonna create a wolf, if it loads in, I don't,

09:38.480 --> 09:39.280
it just crashed,

09:48.320 --> 09:54.160
should I, am I have to turn into like a fucking PNG to play this, I love this game, I do,

09:56.080 --> 10:01.600
it's, it's close to my heart, but it just crashed, oh look there's two of me, hi,

10:04.560 --> 10:16.720
attempt number two, are you hypnotized, are you hypnotized, are you entertained, are you feeling it,

10:17.680 --> 10:18.720
shot of close jutsu,

10:21.520 --> 10:25.200
this should be head incident part two, okay is it gonna go back to wolf quest,

10:29.040 --> 10:31.760
police, oh no they'll make it that,

10:34.480 --> 10:40.560
there we go, perfect, okay let's turn down the game settings even more, we're gonna put them at

10:41.440 --> 10:56.640
fast, what fastest, perfect, everything is so, okay okay wait so this is the fastest version

10:57.280 --> 11:00.000
and then this is the stupendous version,

11:03.200 --> 11:06.000
it's actually quite pretty but my model can't move at all,

11:11.040 --> 11:20.800
so we're going to be playing like this, I have, yeah I have a 10 to 70s so

11:22.560 --> 11:26.640
I kind of like how ganky it looks because this is how I remember it, it looked like this,

11:27.840 --> 11:32.320
the grass was barely there, it was a texture on the ground, the trees were barely loaded in,

11:33.280 --> 11:36.160
actually hold on am I, I'm moving fine, what if I do,

11:37.120 --> 11:42.960
about fast, just so we can have, that looks a little bit better, that looks a little bit better,

11:42.960 --> 11:47.680
now we have some actual grass, so let's do, let's do a new game, create new wolf,

11:48.400 --> 11:53.280
see oh it's working, we're good, oh my god girl we need to get you a better pc,

11:54.240 --> 12:01.680
I will, don't worry I will eventually, I just want to, I have more things I want to do before I

12:01.680 --> 12:10.640
get a pc, I have paying off my debt first, I need to pay off my credit card and then I will get a pc,

12:12.560 --> 12:17.360
then I will put it on that credit card, get the points for it and then pay it off again because

12:17.360 --> 12:23.200
I am a, I'm a smart bunny, madam and debt, madam is, I was about to say the amount of debt,

12:24.800 --> 12:26.480
I don't really count school loans,

12:32.640 --> 12:36.240
it's fine, I'm not going to say because then someone's going to start like donating shit and

12:36.240 --> 12:42.800
I know that's not why I'm, I would bring it up, okay so I have, ooh life is rough pack,

12:45.120 --> 12:49.280
cutie Cinderella, oh my god that's such a pretty wolf, I have to buy the dlc,

12:51.760 --> 12:58.080
her name is 42f Cinderella but it's fine, white lady, that's what I am right now, I'm a white lady,

12:58.640 --> 13:09.360
pretty, these are actual wolves, I actually, it's funny because I, I love like learning

13:09.360 --> 13:14.080
about Yellowstone and stuff so I recognize some of these names because I remember I would,

13:14.080 --> 13:19.120
when I used to be a wolf role player, I was an avid wolf role player on WolfQuest and on like

13:19.120 --> 13:27.920
wiki foundry, aka wet paint and all that shit, we would take the photos from like the famous

13:27.920 --> 13:31.280
wolf pictures and like that would be our OC, like this is my wolf character,

13:33.440 --> 13:38.480
so it's funny that I, like the, the founder ones I recognize, it's just, it's just because I was

13:38.480 --> 13:43.440
just such a, I just really liked wolves because I liked their pack mentality, like the family,

13:43.440 --> 13:49.360
what happened to him, life is rough pack, oh he just has freaking mange, I don't want that,

13:50.080 --> 13:56.800
it's kind of badass, as long as you don't sleep with the fishes, I was a lone wolf in the game,

13:56.800 --> 14:04.240
related wolf, what, you know cats, does it entail like normal death, wolf looks like ice,

14:04.240 --> 14:10.320
yeah she's the white one that did, if, if icy was a wolf, she would be this one, this would be her,

14:10.400 --> 14:21.760
it's so cute, um I, so there's different pack types and there's different um coat types because

14:22.400 --> 14:29.680
wolves come in a variety of coat colors, um I like this one because it looks like me,

14:29.680 --> 14:38.080
because we are both like blondish, why is this one named Brad Pitt, hold on let me move myself over

14:38.160 --> 14:44.720
a little bit, let me make myself a little bit smaller, because I'm blocking a lot of stuff,

14:44.720 --> 14:53.440
my big ass hand, you indulge collab game, oh my god, mischief null, maybe I'll name her that,

14:54.160 --> 15:00.880
um okay, let's make her, I can make myself, oh fuck, there's so much like before, it used to be

15:00.880 --> 15:05.840
like a little wolf and then like a splash page over here on this side, you can't see my mouse,

15:05.840 --> 15:11.040
I don't know why I'm just string, on the left side and then you would just have to pick a

15:11.040 --> 15:17.040
color, you couldn't do all this cool shit or it wasn't based off of actual wolves, um I can give

15:17.040 --> 15:22.480
myself some fucked up eyes, holy shit, I can miss an eye, like I'm winking at you, I kind of like

15:22.480 --> 15:29.760
that, like I'm a little like, I'm winking, I'm winking, uh thank you Charlie for the donut,

15:29.760 --> 15:33.680
wolves and dogs are actually the same species, canis lupus, dogs are substance of the wolf,

15:33.680 --> 15:38.560
you think if I am a, I love wolves and I wouldn't know that but thank you for the information

15:38.560 --> 15:45.280
in the super, I do know, I already knew that, yes, um my cats are playing in my pants that I took

15:45.280 --> 15:53.040
off and I need to put some pants back on actually because my, my hoo-ha is cold, okay let me find

15:53.040 --> 16:00.400

16:42.560 --> 16:49.040
I'm ready to become a wolf guys, I am so ready, I'll say it again, as I said before

16:49.680 --> 16:57.920
in the famous words of bow, the whale, throw me to the wolves and I will come back pregnant

17:02.480 --> 17:10.160
we are wolves, we run it, oh yeah, what the hell is that, tick tock sound, I'm all cringing so

17:10.160 --> 17:15.520
hard on that, wait did I just hear a, am I tripping, did I just hear a voice

17:15.760 --> 17:21.600
oh wait it's my neighbors, okay that just scared the shit out of me, I found somebody

17:23.440 --> 17:27.280
I'm like am I, am I going insane, Texas speech is very loud

17:29.120 --> 17:34.160
oh it was the Texas speech that I heard, that makes sense, it must be loud then, um

17:35.440 --> 17:38.320
I can turn that down a bit but then you guys won't really hear the music

17:46.480 --> 17:54.160
thank you Ninkadargui, shibii cute, thank you for the anonymous tip, 20 dollars debt, cough, PC fault

17:56.160 --> 17:57.280
you guys are too good

18:01.840 --> 18:08.640
okay, mademoiselle had a male voice, yeah I thought, and I realized yeah it was a Texas

18:08.640 --> 18:13.840
speech because I'm like am I tripping, the AI thought I was a streamer for some reason, must be

18:13.920 --> 18:22.800
signed, that's, what, thank you for the other five dollars, um let me turn, because yeah you

18:22.800 --> 18:24.960
guys can't hear the music at all if I turn that down

18:37.760 --> 18:40.320
yeah I know you don't hear any music, it's because I put it down

18:40.880 --> 18:43.440
because it's really loud

18:47.360 --> 18:51.520
but I guess I'll put it up more because it's for some odd reason, it just doesn't

18:54.720 --> 18:56.160
it's fine, I didn't get far

18:56.160 --> 19:09.600
can you hear now

19:16.320 --> 19:20.640

I think the Texas speech is gonna be loud, I'm not sure, I'm scared

19:36.320 --> 19:41.600
I'm terrified, it's gonna happen, oh thank you authorities, thank you, what the hell bro

19:42.480 --> 19:49.760
oh sorry I don't know that

19:57.200 --> 19:58.960
get away system sounds, we don't need you

20:03.120 --> 20:07.440
bye

20:12.080 --> 20:18.800
I'm not good with sounds guys, I just, sounds sounds

20:27.600 --> 20:33.680
occasional great name, you can go see that's like everybody must be green, thank you, hopefully

20:33.680 --> 20:38.320
some of the people that have been hoping to be randomly gifted will get it because they're just

20:38.320 --> 20:42.720
like I'm poor and I'm like that's okay and then that one person that just like kept getting

20:42.720 --> 20:45.280
missed over and over again when people were just like dumping gifted

20:54.000 --> 21:00.800
that was me, congrats everybody's like the great names are just like sad

21:01.120 --> 21:08.240
don't worry, don't worry you're still appreciated, you're still appreciated, you showed up today

21:08.240 --> 21:17.200
that's all I care about, um gray wolves coming out, the grays versus the greens, it's house of

21:17.200 --> 21:24.800
the wolves instead of house of the dragon, if you were in a Game of Thrones house what would you

21:24.800 --> 21:35.120
do, oh it's your lucky day, some of you, it's your lucky day, thank you authorities,

21:37.120 --> 21:38.960
one of you got hit, that's good

21:44.160 --> 21:52.960
there he goes, dubs in the chat boys, dubs in the chat, if I was in Game of Thrones house

21:53.920 --> 21:54.720
I would leave

21:57.360 --> 22:03.920
I feel like I would be like appearance wise, one there's like no brown people except in

22:04.960 --> 22:10.720
over the seas in um what should I call it, wherever

22:12.720 --> 22:18.640
Melisandre is from, no that's the red woman, Melisandre, Misandre is from

22:19.040 --> 22:23.680
but I feel like I would be in house motel based off of appearance if it was a house but I would

22:23.680 --> 22:31.760
I would prefer, I would probably be based off of my model obviously a fucking lannister like

22:31.760 --> 22:37.840
let's be real like I can't like a red and blonde come on like and then Amy would also be a lannister

22:37.840 --> 22:44.240
because like kissing your sister and stuff so gotta keep it, I gotta keep it in the family

22:44.240 --> 22:50.480
but if I would, I would probably, I would obviously, I'd probably be a star because I like the winner a

22:50.480 --> 22:59.280
lot, Dorne, yes Dorne, I'm a Dorne-ish gal, who house the dragon mansion, oh there's a new episode

22:59.280 --> 23:07.200
tonight guys, I was like yelling at my dad because he forgot to pay our subscription because I just

23:07.200 --> 23:13.120
like steal my parents subscriptions for streaming services and like dad you did not pay the HBO

23:14.640 --> 23:18.320
he's just like sorry I'll work on that I'm like so I hope it's freaking fixed today

23:20.480 --> 23:27.200
and trying to be daughter of the kraken you mean she would be house um fuck what house was he from

23:29.360 --> 23:30.800

30:46.560 --> 30:53.520
dying at it for like 15 minutes like I was I was losing it I thought it was so funny

30:54.240 --> 30:58.640

31:12.480 --> 31:17.920
wolf quest characters which was sorrow song because that's badass um and it's funny because

31:17.920 --> 31:24.000

31:34.160 --> 31:43.360
evil needs more edge exactly I have like I think I took a picture of all the names of my

31:43.360 --> 31:47.360
wolves I had like 50 from across all my characters from wolf role playing

31:48.720 --> 31:52.640
my favorite one's name and the one I used the most was

31:56.000 --> 31:57.200
wait I can't even spell it

32:00.240 --> 32:09.920
erotomanthias because in um when I'm like the like thing for wolf role playing

32:10.800 --> 32:17.440
on wet paint wet paint a week of foundry was that you had either a super fucking long name

32:17.440 --> 32:23.840
that was like greek inspired or it was something edgy like that bark follow me yeah it was after

32:23.840 --> 32:30.400
it was a riff of erotomanthias yes um and remember when I said I also had a character

32:30.400 --> 32:34.640
named Arta Xerxes maybe I should just make a male wolf no I want it to be me I need to think

Don't know what does purple mean that I'm hungry. I don't or that I'm thirsty or something

01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:36.160
I don't remember what that stands for

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:43.880
Okay, that's definitely another same little from the pack. Oh, so the colors mean it's who's howling

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.400
That makes a lot more sense. Okay, again, this game has changed a lot

01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:53.320
And I didn't really go through it the mechanics of it back when I

01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:57.600
Started playing it before recently

01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:00.960
Where am I?

01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:03.960
I'm in the center. I'm in no territory

01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:07.940
Just kidding. I'm in territory now. I'm not um

01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:12.440
Maybe

01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:18.380
We're at some fucking out. Can I drink water? Do I need to like do that? Do I need to like? Oh, I

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:23.120
I'm standing awkwardly on a rock and I'm drinking water

01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:27.840
That's pretty cool

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:32.400
Sweet nice

01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:37.320
But what does the purple stand for is that my because I'm tired

01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:44.920
Anything anything on the breeze, no

01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:48.720
Pronghorn

01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:52.880
You'll dear I feel like somebody's on me. No, okay

01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:56.680
You know those trees look promising

01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:01.160
We're birch trees in the line

01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:05.280
They're like perfectly spaced. This is kind of a weird

01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:07.760
No

01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:09.320
Nothing here

01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:15.160
Just the wind in the trees you saw an elk herd. Where's the elk herd? What do you mean? You saw an elk herd?

01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:19.800
What do you mean?

01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:33.000
I'm trying to eat it. I don't want to pick it up. Let me eat it. Am I not hungry?

01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:39.000
Okay, I was gonna say I'm like what the fuck

01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:44.880
Oh, I'm full. Okay. Go orange is hunger. I don't know what purple is

01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:50.640
Where was it in the scent? I did what you're lying to me. I

01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:57.120
Did not smell any I only saw

01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:02.000

01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:34.480
I'm so tired

01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:37.880
From trying to find a boyfriend

01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:41.240
Retired from no sleep

01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:44.840

Not another 3v1. Okay, I should be out very soon. I

01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:58.400
Keep running straight because anything towards the middle is usually good. Maybe if I get over this ridge

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
Nope, I'm just in another section

01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:06.600

01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:43.160
Wolf failure

01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:47.920
He was he was giving me nothing. How can I get he wasn't giving me the same energy back

01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:53.160
He just sat there and howled and I wagged my tail. So I don't think it's gonna work out

01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:56.960
So we're gonna go to whomever this is

01:24:08.720 --> 01:24:12.920
Why am I getting like no sense usually there's a lot more wolves around

01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:18.400
I have to run all over fucking creation to find a boyfriend like hello

01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:24.200
You started getting your ass kicked no, he was intimidated by me

01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:32.440
Because he saw me being the shit at a one dude and then he also saw all my boyfriends who were chasing me out last time

01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:35.480
So that's why mm-hmm

01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:44.240
Why is there's that tree looks like it's sparkling but it just isn't rendered properly I

01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:51.360
Should just do the thing I did before and just go to sleep and then a male will show up

01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:53.360
I just wake up and there's a dude

01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:03.400
I think I might just do that because I don't feel like running all over the place just to find a man

01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:09.080
They can come to me, you know they can come to me. I'm gonna sleep by this rock. It's good shelter

01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:13.080
Let's take a nap

01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:20.400
He's a flat justice site, maybe you know, I respect that

01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:34.520
Am I gonna wake up dispersal wolves ready? Oh

01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:45.560
Hi men can I how's it going? What's up?

01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:52.440

01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:07.040
You're cute. You kind of look like me and

01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:09.720
Then you're a nice-looking

01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:11.560
wolf

01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:13.560
We would have a really good diversity

01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:16.880
We could be a little mixed-race couple

01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:20.960
And we can have little mini-meese

01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:28.080
But like I don't know this guy likes me more. They're all from eight mile pack

01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:31.360
Guys, who should I go with?

01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:39.360

01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:03.960

01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:05.960
I

01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:08.600
Know people are gonna be so mad

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.640
They're gonna be gonna take it away and be like wow

01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:16.640
Either either she be it's either gonna be it's two choices

01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:21.280
They're just gonna be like she be gets blacked or she be doesn't like black dudes. Oh

It's a game I'm making jokes for your enjoyment everybody fucking relax

01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:31.640
It's not that serious. Oh my god

01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:36.760
It just reminds me of the time where people were freaking out that Emmy got a toy that was like darker than it was supposed to be

01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:41.960
People are like we're like sending her marrows like I feel I would be really

01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:48.000
Disappointed in you if you used that I would be really like they said are the wrong one

01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:55.040
They said are the wrong one an accident and people were getting mad, but they said are a wrong toy that was

01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:00.760
It was so funny to me I'm like bruh

01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:19.600
But maybe I should go for the black and white wolf, you know

01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:30.000
Honestly, I think the diversity would be good for our puppies, you know keeps the the gene pools. Oh, he wants to howl with me

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:31.680
I'll howl with you

01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:33.680
They just jealous

01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:38.840
It just it literally just boggled my mind, but then I'm like, okay

01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:45.600
Is that like would that be the equivalent of like me getting mad at like a male streamer for getting a

01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:48.640
white

01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:52.160
Toy instead of a black one and I'm like, no, I just

01:29:57.920 --> 01:30:01.520
Don't care I'm like I don't take it that personally

01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:05.120
Oh

01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:07.120
But I'm like men are different

01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:09.200
Men are different. They have different

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
insecurities

01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:15.440

01:38:42.500 --> 01:38:47.220
Three hours. Okay, so it's this way, but like I don't want to go that way

01:38:49.620 --> 01:38:53.140
What if I go like that way? Oh look all the like scent on the wind

01:38:53.860 --> 01:38:55.860
let's go this way just because

01:38:55.860 --> 01:39:01.860
We kind of void packs. I don't feel like fighting for our lives

01:39:02.580 --> 01:39:04.580
Although it is very romantic

01:39:06.500 --> 01:39:08.500
Discord mods to be fun today

01:39:14.740 --> 01:39:17.220
I don't know. I have to think of a cool name for him has to be edgy

01:39:19.540 --> 01:39:21.540
Maybe we'll call him like emo claw

01:39:22.500 --> 01:39:26.580
Okay, that's great. Um, I smell a lot of stuff

01:39:29.300 --> 01:39:31.860
Or we're not in a territory. I don't know why people are howling

01:39:34.420 --> 01:39:36.420
He's howling back, uh

01:39:36.420 --> 01:39:40.820
Because I ain't no howl back girl ain't no howl back girl

01:39:42.340 --> 01:39:46.340
Can you like help me find a herd bro? Like you're kind of useless actually

01:39:46.660 --> 01:39:48.660
He's kind of just following me. I don't

01:39:49.540 --> 01:39:52.580
I don't know if he's living up to my expectations. I don't even already went. Oh

01:39:53.460 --> 01:39:55.460
Okay, right there. That's fine

01:39:56.580 --> 01:39:58.580
I remember I think the last time I played

01:39:59.140 --> 01:40:02.980
Like the person like the little the wolf I chose just like didn't even follow me

01:40:04.100 --> 01:40:07.860
I would have to like come back and be like come on. Come on

01:40:12.580 --> 01:40:14.580
There's nothing in the air

01:40:15.540 --> 01:40:19.300
So we need to go into a pack territory to like get food

01:40:25.220 --> 01:40:29.780
Usually when there's like an eagle around that means there's like a carcass, but I don't think so

01:40:33.460 --> 01:40:36.180
All right, let's just keep running straight. He misses the boys

01:40:36.980 --> 01:40:40.820
Call him cat. He's a bit subby. Yeah, I guess he's a little maybe I'll call him subby

01:40:41.700 --> 01:40:43.700
Whoa

01:40:44.580 --> 01:40:46.580

01:41:11.300 --> 01:41:13.300
We're going

01:41:14.820 --> 01:41:16.820
Boom, boom

01:41:17.140 --> 01:41:19.140
Locked on

01:41:21.620 --> 01:41:23.620
He's kind of slow I'm much faster than him

01:41:28.100 --> 01:41:32.420
I'm getting closer I'm coming for your ass. I'm coming for your ass. I'm coming for the ass

01:41:36.100 --> 01:41:43.300
Help me. Oh, it's the fawn. Perfect. Help me. You're not helping me. Okay, you're helping me. That's better

01:41:44.980 --> 01:41:48.900
Leave your child to die. It's fine. Well, I'm going to turn around and kill you

01:41:48.900 --> 01:41:54.820
I swear to god if you don't let us kill her good. She's dead now. We feast now. We howl

01:41:56.100 --> 01:41:58.100
Where you go

01:41:58.820 --> 01:42:02.420
Excuse you. Did you just pick that up and what you don't want to eat with me?

01:42:08.500 --> 01:42:10.900
I'm actually kind of mad

01:42:11.860 --> 01:42:15.460
He literally just picked up food and walked away because he didn't want to eat with me

01:42:16.580 --> 01:42:22.260
Um, well, I'm starting to think you're a dick. I don't think this is going to work out

01:42:23.940 --> 01:42:28.740
I think I think we should see other people that just faded into the ground

01:42:30.900 --> 01:42:32.900
Where are you going bro?

01:42:33.140 --> 01:42:35.140
Bro

01:42:38.740 --> 01:42:41.240
My mouth is full. Oh, sorry. Let me drop that

01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:43.240
I

01:42:59.400 --> 01:43:05.480
Said I can cancel it if I growl three times I'm growling I don't watch you

01:43:12.040 --> 01:43:16.920
We're not working out. I'm sorry. You decided that I'm not good enough to eat with

01:43:18.600 --> 01:43:20.600
Farewell discord kitten

01:43:22.520 --> 01:43:30.840
Fucking piece of shit. Fuck you. Yeah, fucking I should kill him. Can I kill him?

01:43:32.760 --> 01:43:34.920
Oh, no, I can only fucking

01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:39.880
All right boys

01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:43.320
He's better off

01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:50.520
Yeah, I don't I don't like the passive aggressiveness. Am I gonna be able to smell things? I don't think I can smell in the rain that well

01:43:52.760 --> 01:43:54.760
Um, let's go

01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:02.280
Remember when we sat here and we walked around together

01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:05.480
Yeah, oh wait, he's right in front of me

01:44:06.360 --> 01:44:10.360
All right, let's go the opposite direction. We don't need this. We don't need that dead weight, you know

01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:14.840
I don't need that. I don't need that dead weight

01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:20.120
We're gonna howl and find ourselves a new man

01:44:23.080 --> 01:44:24.920
I don't like brats

01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:27.800
I don't feel I'm I don't feel like taming anybody. I need someone who

01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:30.920
Will be a partner

01:44:32.280 --> 01:44:34.280
I want a partner

01:44:35.080 --> 01:44:37.080
Not somebody who can even

01:44:37.640 --> 01:44:43.160
Okay, that storm actually crack just scared me. Um, wait, I could just fall asleep and men will show up to me again

01:44:44.520 --> 01:44:47.880
Oh my god, am I gonna get struck by lightning while I'm sleeping?

01:44:58.840 --> 01:45:02.040
We're feral today, you know, and taming anything. Yeah

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.960
Um, sure, who are you?

01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:11.560
You're the dude from before you're back

01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:13.880
You showed up last time

01:45:13.960 --> 01:45:18.680
And I said you were too old for me, but you know, I really like your persistence

01:45:19.960 --> 01:45:25.400
Let's try it. Let's try it. I like his persistence. He he he tried courting me before

01:45:25.400 --> 01:45:40.280
He's loyal. He's just like he's sick. He just I don't know. He just showed up when I needed him, you know, like

01:45:41.160 --> 01:45:43.160
He is he does seem like a ride or die

01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:52.440
The bark is the howl is not it though. Um, but maybe we can work on that. So let's continue

01:45:53.400 --> 01:45:55.400
I'll do a little play bow for you

01:45:57.320 --> 01:45:59.320
Do you enjoy

01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:01.400
Do you like the play bow

01:46:01.880 --> 01:46:03.880
You're sitting

01:46:04.040 --> 01:46:07.320
Is my play bow not good enough? Why did you wait for me to wake up then?

01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:10.280
Can I

01:46:15.240 --> 01:46:17.240
Are you interested

01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:20.520
Are you just here to yell at me? Okay, let's do it

01:46:21.480 --> 01:46:23.480
Uh, let's sniff noses

01:46:24.280 --> 01:46:25.880
Sneef, sneef

01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:27.160
Oh

01:46:27.160 --> 01:46:29.160
He's literally me, but in gray

01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:36.440
Does he have a floppy ear? Oh my god. We both have floppy ears. Maybe that's why he likes me

01:46:38.760 --> 01:46:41.240
A03 just wanted to see if I'm okay. Maybe he's

01:46:42.280 --> 01:46:44.280
Maybe he's just a friend. I don't know

01:46:45.320 --> 01:46:49.720
Maybe old but I can still give you a good time. He's a bit of a fixer-upper. I don't know. He's cute

01:46:49.960 --> 01:46:51.720
He's cute

01:46:51.720 --> 01:46:55.720
Okay, all right. Hold on. Let's do a little

01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:02.680
Let's do an uh, a little roll

01:47:03.320 --> 01:47:07.560
Let me I don't need to I don't need to slow down. Don't tell me to slow down

01:47:08.920 --> 01:47:10.920
I'm trying to get this over as fast as possible

01:47:13.880 --> 01:47:15.880
And see if you're good enough for me 803

01:47:17.320 --> 01:47:19.320
Like how I just fucking jump

01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:22.440
You you're not even watching me

01:47:24.440 --> 01:47:27.160
I don't really think he's that interested. I think he's just a good guy

01:47:28.760 --> 01:47:30.760
Maybe I don't know

01:47:32.520 --> 01:47:34.520
Hello

01:47:36.760 --> 01:47:40.440

Okay, what a sub. I'm gonna establish my dominance

01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:48.200
The chin rest

01:47:48.200 --> 01:47:50.200
Except I'm not touching you, but it's fine

01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:54.680
Oh, he's such a sub look. I'm looking away. He's so bashful

01:47:56.440 --> 01:48:02.440
Sir, okay, I'll give you you know, I'll do a confident tail wag because I'm the I'm the alphas here

01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:07.560

01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:12.840
Oh, you know wag your tail too. Aren't we just cute?

01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:15.800

01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:19.080
Or not

01:48:20.280 --> 01:48:23.160
I don't know what the fuck just happened what I just do

01:48:25.400 --> 01:48:27.400
Let's let's do a little sniff

01:48:28.600 --> 01:48:30.600
No, sniff

He is I don't know, you know, how did the viewer get in the game?

01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:38.760
Um, let's do a little

01:48:39.080 --> 01:48:45.080
A little roll you like that

01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:53.400
He just walked away

01:49:01.320 --> 01:49:03.320
He just left

01:49:09.160 --> 01:49:13.400
I'm like hurt. I thought he cared about me

01:49:17.560 --> 01:49:23.400
I guess he couldn't handle my alpha, bro, it's fucking winter. I'm so fast

01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:29.720
Guys, I don't know what to do. He's gonna go see his wife

01:49:30.440 --> 01:49:33.800
Like why did he he literally just walk he was so close

01:49:34.520 --> 01:49:36.520
I'm

01:49:38.120 --> 01:49:40.120
I'm genuinely shocked

01:49:41.560 --> 01:49:43.560
But it's fine

01:49:43.800 --> 01:49:47.320
I guess he was I guess you you know, maybe he's a gay friend that yeah

01:49:47.320 --> 01:49:50.280
It was like gasses you up and it's like you're when you're wingman

01:49:52.680 --> 01:49:54.920
Or like maybe he's just being a good guy, you know what?

01:49:57.160 --> 01:50:02.200
We're just it was it was right person wrong time, you know

01:50:04.120 --> 01:50:05.720
It wasn't

01:50:05.720 --> 01:50:09.960
It wasn't me. It was it wasn't him. It was me, you know

01:50:10.840 --> 01:50:14.840
He was too intimidated. He didn't see me as an equal. He wasn't looking me in the eye

01:50:16.760 --> 01:50:18.760
Um, I don't really need to eat right now

01:50:21.240 --> 01:50:23.080
But if I

01:50:23.080 --> 01:50:28.280
Sleep again, though, he'll show back up. He isn't into maybe he was just yeah, I don't know. I just got

01:50:28.840 --> 01:50:30.280
I kind of just got

01:50:30.280 --> 01:50:32.520
Jipped, but you know, I'll recover. I'm a big girl

01:50:34.360 --> 01:50:39.640
Is anybody gonna, you know, respond to me or

01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:46.120
What is that? Is that a fucking hair or what's happening down there? I think it's a bunny

01:50:58.520 --> 01:51:00.520
I'm so far away

01:51:01.160 --> 01:51:07.320
Like how I eat a hair carcass and like one bite. Um, let's take a little sip I suppose

01:51:12.120 --> 01:51:18.440
Everybody hurt I'm gonna turn three. I'm gonna turn three and have no man

01:51:21.080 --> 01:51:23.080
Current quest get a mate

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
Okay, I'm still two

01:51:27.720 --> 01:51:29.720
Do you like my bio

01:51:34.280 --> 01:51:38.520
If you just showed up, do you like my bow? Um, my name is chartreuse kooch

01:51:40.440 --> 01:51:43.640
But yeah, I can get perks what the fuck

01:51:45.080 --> 01:51:49.080
Um, let's how

01:51:51.080 --> 01:51:55.720
I can't even the bio isn't true. I am lying to myself a little bit

01:51:57.960 --> 01:52:01.720
It's a map look like we're going to the edge of glory

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:08.120
There's no wolves around bro. I'm gonna cry

01:52:11.080 --> 01:52:13.560
There's no nobody wants me

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.240
Ain't nobody gonna match my freak

01:52:18.440 --> 01:52:24.680
I don't even go on tech talk anymore, but that song keeps showing up just like in general in my day to day life

01:52:25.400 --> 01:52:28.360
Just like on twitter ain't nobody gonna match my freak

01:52:28.840 --> 01:52:31.560
Ain't nobody gonna match and I'm just like so sick of it

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.240
Of hearing ain't nobody gonna match my freak

01:52:36.680 --> 01:52:38.680
I'm just gonna eat some bunnies real quick

01:52:40.600 --> 01:52:42.920
There's a lot of society am I winning no

01:52:43.480 --> 01:52:48.360
I had there's one dude who didn't want to eat dinner with me and he literally picked up his food as left

01:52:48.440 --> 01:52:51.960
It was the equivalent of a like just like oh, I need to go use the bathroom real quick

01:52:52.040 --> 01:52:54.440
And then just left me with the bill and then another dude

01:52:54.440 --> 01:52:58.120
I woke up and he was just like just trying to make me feel better and I was coming on to him

01:52:58.200 --> 01:53:02.200
But you know, he wasn't interested. He just walked away right in the middle of our courtship. So it's

01:53:02.920 --> 01:53:07.400
It's not going too hot. I'm kind of disappointed. Uh, I thought I'd have a lot more

01:53:09.160 --> 01:53:12.040
You know luck, but you know, sometimes it's not meant to be

01:53:13.960 --> 01:53:16.840
I'm just trying to find my mr. Right, okay

01:53:19.800 --> 01:53:21.800
I just want to have puppies

01:53:21.960 --> 01:53:23.960
Oh, let's go this way

01:53:32.040 --> 01:53:34.040
Okay, I'm getting closer

01:53:34.360 --> 01:53:35.640
usually

01:53:35.640 --> 01:53:37.640
Oh, I'm just gonna fall asleep

01:53:38.840 --> 01:53:40.840
It's just easier that way. I don't feel like

01:53:41.640 --> 01:53:43.960
Running all over and then I'm gonna run by them

01:53:52.040 --> 01:53:54.540
Anybody any men?

01:53:58.600 --> 01:54:05.880
Nobody wants me bro, why don't we get the option to a dopa cat? Nope, I didn't mean to cut myself off

01:54:16.200 --> 01:54:19.240
I'm not a spinster. I'm only two years old

01:54:22.600 --> 01:54:24.600
I

01:54:30.920 --> 01:54:33.320
Will travel across the land

01:54:34.120 --> 01:54:36.120
searching for wine

02:05:27.800 --> 02:05:32.640

I wanted to do a whole thing and wouldn't let me do it

02:31:43.600 --> 02:31:47.280
I wanted to call bionicle. Oh, okay, I like that

02:31:48.960 --> 02:31:50.960
I

02:31:59.040 --> 02:32:04.720
Bionautical perfect

02:32:10.080 --> 02:32:12.080
Bionautical

02:32:14.080 --> 02:32:17.680
The vermillion

02:32:19.120 --> 02:32:21.120
Bionautic fuck I need to space

02:32:22.880 --> 02:32:24.880
The harem

02:32:26.320 --> 02:32:31.360
The the bionautical oh my god, I almost dropped my controller

02:32:34.640 --> 02:32:39.120
I'm just gonna call him the bionautical. Why is that I look like an L?

02:32:41.760 --> 02:32:46.720
You and your main are forming a new family a family snapshot has been saved you give you the family tree in the main menu

02:32:47.600 --> 02:32:50.880
Oh, no, we're gonna establish our fucking territory. How about that?

02:32:53.520 --> 02:32:55.520
That I bionautical three

02:32:56.640 --> 02:33:01.520
Okay, we need to find a den use the iconator compass to find it. Okay

02:33:02.960 --> 02:33:08.000
Winter has arrived snow no blankets the slopes of amethyst mountain bring grass beneath it

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:13.840
All curds are migrating down into limar valley and search for winter raising grounds follow them down if you want to keep eating

02:33:14.800 --> 02:33:20.160
You and your mate are expecting pups. You must now carve out your own territory here in the lower slopes of amethyst mountain later

02:33:20.640 --> 02:33:24.400
But for just for the pups are born in two months. You must find a good den within your territory

02:33:24.800 --> 02:33:28.640
Other packs are also expecting puppies. So they're establishing and expanding their territories, too

02:33:28.800 --> 02:33:33.120
You need to make sure you claim enough space to create a safe buffer to protect your vulnerable pups from them

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:36.000
Okay

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.000
potential den sites

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:44.640
potential dens face south to catch what the spring sunshine must turn out about great

02:33:47.440 --> 02:33:49.440
I'm an area by marking it

02:33:51.360 --> 02:33:54.480
Okay, fifth I need 15 hexes

02:33:55.840 --> 02:33:57.840
Okay, uh, cuz like

02:33:58.480 --> 02:34:02.000
Oh, we can eat this meat. Not that meat. The meat's still good

02:34:02.960 --> 02:34:07.440
I won't even let me interact with it. Um, sorry. I'm locked on you. Oh, you're like covered in snow

02:34:07.440 --> 02:34:09.440
I'm covered in snow

02:34:10.720 --> 02:34:12.720
Okay

02:34:13.120 --> 02:34:15.120
So limar

02:34:18.560 --> 02:34:20.560
They're gonna be down here

02:34:21.840 --> 02:34:26.480
So we should probably work our territory around this area. So I want to

02:34:27.600 --> 02:34:28.880
aim

02:34:28.880 --> 02:34:30.880
over here

02:34:31.280 --> 02:34:33.280
Like right over here

02:34:33.440 --> 02:34:35.440
near. Yeah, like this area

02:34:36.400 --> 02:34:38.000
Spawn rock

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:40.880
And like because just because of the elk is all going to be down here

02:34:42.240 --> 02:34:44.240
And there I think you probably steal their shit

02:34:45.120 --> 02:34:47.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, can I set a marker?

02:34:49.200 --> 02:34:51.200
How do I make a marker?

02:34:51.760 --> 02:34:58.000
Add custom marker, please. I would like a marker. How do I add a marker? How do I add it?

02:35:06.320 --> 02:35:08.320
Is that

02:35:08.480 --> 02:35:10.800
Is that just how do I fucking?

02:35:14.400 --> 02:35:17.840
How do I get to how do I make the fucking marker?

02:35:22.240 --> 02:35:24.240
I just want to make a destination

02:35:25.040 --> 02:35:30.160
Uh destination final destination right here

02:35:30.160 --> 02:35:32.160
I

02:35:35.120 --> 02:35:37.280
Can't do anything with it though

02:35:38.960 --> 02:35:44.720
I wish I could just like mark it like it's fucking Elden Ring, but I think it's just it's not that's not what it is

02:35:46.320 --> 02:35:51.360
Okay, I think I'm misinterpreting what that means sex alive

02:35:52.880 --> 02:35:54.880
Sorry, I'll just start sex alive

02:35:55.840 --> 02:35:57.840
Okay, we ran into a lot of these wolves

02:36:00.880 --> 02:36:04.640
Who do we kill moved elsewhere with mate?

02:36:15.520 --> 02:36:17.520
All right

02:36:18.240 --> 02:36:23.760
Shanks, let me aim myself in the right direction. I think it's this is this way. Oh, I can eat this now

02:36:24.880 --> 02:36:26.880
I'm nom nom deli. So

02:36:28.080 --> 02:36:30.080
Coyote

02:36:31.120 --> 02:36:34.160
Let's go up here

02:36:44.080 --> 02:36:50.480
Oh, there's a nearby den site too. Is that the den? No, that's just a rock

02:36:51.280 --> 02:36:53.280
I

02:36:56.400 --> 02:37:01.440
Want to get a little bit closer to the Lamar. Yeah

02:37:04.400 --> 02:37:05.760
For a

02:37:05.760 --> 02:37:09.920
Because I bet I'll have run into a den on the way there and dens are so irritating to find

02:37:10.240 --> 02:37:13.760
I remember searching for like an hour when I was younger trying to find a den

02:37:13.840 --> 02:37:15.920
And it was just like really weirdly like how they

02:37:16.320 --> 02:37:20.800
Helped you because they use ascent markers for everything and you could never tell which direction shit was in

02:37:23.360 --> 02:37:25.360
Okay, we're gonna slide down this hill

02:37:26.320 --> 02:37:31.840
Wait, hold on. Let me just make sure. Yeah, we're good. I don't want to slide down into enemy territory and get fucking stuck

02:37:33.600 --> 02:37:35.600
All I see is whiteness

02:37:35.840 --> 02:37:39.600
It is a absolute blizzard out here. Okay. It was supposed to thunderstorm and it hasn't

02:37:40.400 --> 02:37:42.400
I can't what's happening

02:37:46.480 --> 02:37:50.000
Is is it not gonna rain today? Why do we have a thunderstorm warning if it's not gonna even rain?

02:37:51.200 --> 02:37:54.000
I wanted it to thunder either thunder

02:37:55.840 --> 02:38:01.600
Okay, where are we close just go a little bit angle. Yeah

02:38:07.760 --> 02:38:10.880
I want to get right up to their hexagon

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:20.640
Although it's gonna be such a bitch to maintain the territory territory because it's a ridge right there

02:38:22.400 --> 02:38:24.400
It's fine

02:38:37.440 --> 02:38:41.600
As far as there's like no fucking dens in the area

02:38:41.680 --> 02:38:47.760
Do you mean what are you gonna name your children? I don't know. We'll have to see how many puppies

02:38:47.760 --> 02:38:49.760
I have and if they even fucking live, you know

02:38:54.960 --> 02:39:02.160
Look, he's just happy to be here. Okay, let's calm down a little bit over here

02:39:11.840 --> 02:39:13.840
Why there are so many wolves nearby

02:39:16.720 --> 02:39:18.720
Okay

02:39:19.360 --> 02:39:22.640
Our territory I'm gonna go over here a little bit more

02:39:25.200 --> 02:39:27.200
Is that a bird?

02:39:32.080 --> 02:39:35.760
So I want a piss it's pissing time

02:39:38.960 --> 02:39:40.960

02:40:03.520 --> 02:40:08.640

02:40:12.560 --> 02:40:18.160
I really want to be up against this lake because like fresh water. That's where they go, you know

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:22.000

Should go let's see

02:40:50.720 --> 02:40:54.480
I could probably claim some of their territory because it's weak

02:40:59.680 --> 02:41:02.720
I wonder if I will be able to piss on somebody else's territory

02:41:03.360 --> 02:41:11.680

interesting

02:42:16.880 --> 02:42:25.040
So I literally have to find the scent post in order to claim it for myself. That's dumb

02:42:28.720 --> 02:42:34.000
Okay, maybe I'll just focus on doing my own hexes then let's just pee here

02:42:38.640 --> 02:42:41.680
To pee right next to this fucking tree

02:42:46.720 --> 02:42:51.120
Cool should have been more strategic on where I peed but it's fine

02:42:54.880 --> 02:42:58.240
You just try to pee next to a landmark so I can remember where the fuck it is

02:43:01.200 --> 02:43:05.760
Oh, I'm like right on the edge of both our territories, huh? All right, let's keep going this way

02:43:10.160 --> 02:43:13.760
We're gonna have to break into their territory and steal their elk

02:43:14.480 --> 02:43:15.440
Oh

02:43:15.440 --> 02:43:17.600

Fossil forest

02:43:37.920 --> 02:43:39.920
Fossil forest is like

02:43:40.640 --> 02:43:43.760
In a really bitchy place so I kind of don't want to mark over here

02:43:45.840 --> 02:43:47.840
Because climbing hills is such a thing

02:43:49.600 --> 02:43:51.600
But it seems like I have to

02:43:58.320 --> 02:44:00.320

02:46:50.160 --> 02:46:52.160
But this game was supposed to be easy

02:46:53.680 --> 02:46:59.200
Okay, we're pissing here. We're taking this over

02:47:04.640 --> 02:47:06.640

Get fucking wrecked dude this is our spot

02:50:04.960 --> 02:50:08.880
I didn't mean to do that. Um the binautical

02:50:09.440 --> 02:50:11.440
I

02:50:13.200 --> 02:50:21.520
Just watched that the other again the other day and I was like, oh this movie's so fucking funny. It's just great. Okay. Let's go over here

02:50:28.560 --> 02:50:32.880
She'll define a fucking den I gotta fill up 15 hexes. Oh my god

02:50:33.360 --> 02:50:38.400
Such a hard-working mother. I'm just I'm just running around pregnant doing all this shit. Can you believe that?

02:50:38.880 --> 02:50:40.880
I

02:50:44.320 --> 02:50:47.120
Don't wanna okay cool cool cool cool

02:50:49.680 --> 02:50:53.680
How many dens are in a territory? I don't even know it's like two one

02:50:58.640 --> 02:51:03.440
Is that a den over there that big ass tree my pee at that big ass tree

02:51:04.160 --> 02:51:06.960
We're peeing at this cool ass tree

02:51:08.400 --> 02:51:12.800
Oh, hell yeah, this is a perfect tree to piss on look at this cool ass tree to piss on

02:51:15.440 --> 02:51:17.440
Amazing

02:51:19.280 --> 02:51:21.280
Okay, then we'll keep going straight now

02:51:23.760 --> 02:51:25.760
Just running in a circle

02:51:28.160 --> 02:51:30.160
Not much to do

02:51:34.080 --> 02:51:38.080
Really getting in the wolf minds that wolves don't leave in trees. It doesn't matter. It's a cool tree to piss on

02:51:38.800 --> 02:51:40.800
As they fall down a fucking hill

02:51:42.880 --> 02:51:46.160
We're going after this pack we're taking their fucking territory

02:51:47.840 --> 02:51:49.520
It's like fucking jenga

02:51:49.520 --> 02:51:51.520
I wonder if we can because again

02:51:51.520 --> 02:51:53.360
When I played this game

02:51:53.360 --> 02:51:58.560
When I was younger you could it was up to the point where you could have puppies and that was it and then they

02:51:58.720 --> 02:52:03.520
It's either that you let them live or they died, but you couldn't like expand the pack after that

02:52:03.600 --> 02:52:05.600
So if you can that's very cool to me

02:52:07.200 --> 02:52:13.520
Oh that thing just fucking juked me. Um, we can probably piss anywhere right for this one

02:52:15.680 --> 02:52:19.680
Where's a good spot to piss in this place I'm just trying to try to piss in a nice spot

02:52:23.600 --> 02:52:26.640
I don't really think they left a set marker so I'm just gonna put it right here

02:52:29.120 --> 02:52:31.120
Oh

02:52:34.640 --> 02:52:36.880
Oh my god my ass hurts from sitting

02:52:37.920 --> 02:52:39.920
How are you doing by an article?

02:52:40.320 --> 02:52:46.960
You're peeing good job, bro. Good job. We're gonna we're bordering. Let's see this way perfect

02:52:49.600 --> 02:52:51.600
We're going around the border

02:52:52.640 --> 02:52:55.360
We're very strategic in our placement

02:52:56.160 --> 02:53:01.280
We need we need strong borders for our family nice scenic view for the piss spot exactly

02:53:05.600 --> 02:53:07.600
Let's see, where are we going?

02:53:08.880 --> 02:53:12.400
Oh, I'm going the wrong way. I need to go this way. Nope

02:53:14.000 --> 02:53:16.320
What how the fuck did I get turned around?

02:53:21.120 --> 02:53:23.120
Okay, I guess it's this way then

02:53:23.120 --> 02:53:25.120
I

02:53:25.200 --> 02:53:28.640
Haven't seen one other den and I'm running all over the fucking place

02:53:29.920 --> 02:53:33.600
That's an Oreo blizzard. Oh my god, sweetie. You want an Oreo blizzard?

02:53:39.360 --> 02:53:45.360
Then nearby here we go. Oh, what the fuck? Oh, okay. We don't I don't want cougars near a den though

02:53:47.040 --> 02:53:49.040
Where's the den

02:53:49.760 --> 02:53:51.760
Over here that it

02:53:52.720 --> 02:53:56.080
This fucking nope, that's just a cool ass rock. I'm gonna piss right here

02:54:03.200 --> 02:54:07.280
I would rather not have a cougar near the den. Where is it?

02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:12.000
So this nearby

02:54:12.960 --> 02:54:14.960
Okay

02:54:18.960 --> 02:54:23.520
Am I close I don't I know it changes color. Nope. I'm going farther away because it's like this

02:54:23.600 --> 02:54:25.760
It's just like it's hot or cold and it's dumb

02:54:26.560 --> 02:54:28.560
The hot and cold

02:54:32.880 --> 02:54:38.320
Where is it then? Okay, I guess it's in this direction heading east

02:54:38.800 --> 02:54:42.640
No, is this the den? I don't

02:54:44.480 --> 02:54:46.480
This has to be it

02:54:49.040 --> 02:54:51.520
No, damn I should have pissed at the top of this

02:54:54.160 --> 02:54:56.560
Because it's turning orange like right over here

02:54:58.880 --> 02:55:00.880
Where's the fucking den by nautical

02:55:05.280 --> 02:55:07.280
There's no den smell

02:55:08.720 --> 02:55:10.720
Oh

02:55:13.680 --> 02:55:18.880
My god, this is it didn't take me a fucking bazillion years to find out where the fucking den is

02:55:21.520 --> 02:55:28.880
Farther away. Yep. It's so this direction it's fucking cougar out of here

02:55:28.880 --> 02:55:41.920
Why I don't understand what the fuck I just like fell down this cliff face if I go this way

02:55:44.160 --> 02:55:47.600
Oh, it turned why is it only orange right here?

02:55:49.840 --> 02:55:51.280
I don't

02:55:51.280 --> 02:55:56.480
Is there supposed to be I feel like there's supposed to be one here. I don't maybe I'm supposed to fill up the thing

02:55:56.640 --> 02:55:58.640
I don't know

02:55:59.840 --> 02:56:03.600
There's two homeless puppies pissing everywhere

02:56:12.400 --> 02:56:14.400
I have to find four dens

02:56:20.080 --> 02:56:23.200
How am I supposed to get four fucking debt what?

02:56:23.920 --> 02:56:30.000
You're actually fucked bro. You're actually fucked if you think I'm gonna find this shit when you're not even giving me the

02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:32.960
Scent markers to find them. You're just giving me hot and cold

02:56:33.360 --> 02:56:37.280
Stupid dumb shit. I don't care anymore. I'm gonna focus on the hexes

02:56:40.160 --> 02:56:42.160
Come here

02:56:44.720 --> 02:56:50.640
You hungry here you can have it. Well you bro take a bite

02:56:53.440 --> 02:56:55.440
You want it?

02:56:56.960 --> 02:57:02.880
Can I see something can I tell him to eat? No, okay

02:57:06.880 --> 02:57:09.680
Family's not gonna last winter if we can't do this bro

02:57:12.320 --> 02:57:15.360
I'm going the wrong way. There we go. That's better

02:57:24.160 --> 02:57:27.760
There's four densites you have actually got to be out of your mind

02:57:29.520 --> 02:57:33.360
I don't ever I know I hope acts because I remember doing like this

02:57:33.440 --> 02:57:36.320
It was I think it was like three or two densites when I was younger

02:57:36.800 --> 02:57:40.800
But it was such a pain to find them because like they weren't obvious

02:57:41.680 --> 02:57:48.960
Anything like that giant fucking rock would be obvious, but it wasn't. Um, is there any nice thing to piss on around here? No

02:57:49.840 --> 02:57:56.560
No, no pissable items. No pissable scenery. Okay, I guess I'll just piss in the middle right here

02:57:57.280 --> 02:57:59.280
There's this dead tree. How about that?

02:58:06.080 --> 02:58:09.840
Cool. All right, let's uh

02:58:13.600 --> 02:58:17.600
I could go for those hexes in the corner, but I'm not going to right now

02:58:18.480 --> 02:58:20.480
See yeah, I'll go for

02:58:21.520 --> 02:58:23.520
These hexes over here

02:58:24.880 --> 02:58:27.360
I feel like I'm playing a really bad chest chest

02:58:36.800 --> 02:58:40.240
Love the tune you get for peeing on something I love the sound

02:58:41.600 --> 02:58:43.600
the the fucking

02:58:43.760 --> 02:58:45.040
game

02:58:45.040 --> 02:58:46.480
sounds

02:58:46.560 --> 02:58:48.560
In music it's just so great

02:58:50.160 --> 02:58:52.160
It's a great pissable rock

02:58:53.600 --> 02:58:55.600
Oh going the wrong way

02:58:56.400 --> 02:58:58.400
There we go

02:59:01.440 --> 02:59:03.440
That's a great pissable rock

02:59:08.560 --> 02:59:10.560
Too close

02:59:12.640 --> 02:59:14.640
That rock right there

02:59:15.440 --> 02:59:22.000
It's just gonna be it. Nope still in the territory. What the fuck? Oh wait, it's like right near it

02:59:23.520 --> 02:59:25.200
Oh, okay

02:59:25.200 --> 02:59:27.200
We'll piss right near it

02:59:28.160 --> 02:59:30.160
Let's go buy nautical

02:59:33.040 --> 02:59:35.040
This again

02:59:35.840 --> 02:59:37.840
I need to find a set marker for this one

02:59:45.520 --> 02:59:47.760
That's doom

02:59:51.920 --> 02:59:53.920
At least there's like food around

02:59:57.760 --> 03:00:02.640
I feel like my field of view is so fucking narrow that I can't even see where shit might be

03:00:10.240 --> 03:00:12.240
I'm gonna piss

03:00:14.960 --> 03:00:17.840
Sick, okay, I guess I just couldn't piss in the other spot before

03:00:20.560 --> 03:00:27.520
Nice all right, we stole that from them and then we're just gonna go up here

03:00:32.640 --> 03:00:34.640
Fuck is up with the music

03:00:35.840 --> 03:00:37.840
Is there somebody nearby I don't

03:00:39.680 --> 03:00:41.680
Why is there boss music

03:00:42.160 --> 03:00:44.160
You

03:00:44.480 --> 03:00:46.480
Already

03:00:47.200 --> 03:00:54.160
That was pretty ominous your field of view is worse than that. Honestly the field of view in this game is horrible

03:01:03.280 --> 03:01:08.320
Am I too tired? Oh, I am too tired doesn't fucking let's go to sleep, bro

03:01:08.880 --> 03:01:12.720

Am I gonna have to be pissing everywhere?

03:01:36.320 --> 03:01:38.320

Dead nearby. Oh, is this a dead? Nope. It's gone. You know, I already lost it. Where is it?

03:01:52.320 --> 03:01:54.960

03:08:17.280 --> 03:08:19.280
Can I please

03:08:19.520 --> 03:08:21.520
Can I please not do this? Oh, okay

03:08:22.480 --> 03:08:24.800
Hi Fiya. What's up little girl?

03:08:33.680 --> 03:08:35.680
I didn't mean to howl, but I guess that works

03:08:38.320 --> 03:08:41.840
Our new nope that doesn't do it

03:08:47.920 --> 03:08:52.000
I pee anywhere for this one because I'd rather just feel like I pee every pee anywhere

03:08:53.760 --> 03:08:57.040
You just stinker. Yeah, it's a fucking stinker piss

03:09:04.000 --> 03:09:10.000
I will piss so much too soon

03:09:14.400 --> 03:09:18.640
Okay, I feel like I thought I would have to go and piss in the same spot, but it seems like you don't have to

03:09:19.840 --> 03:09:21.840
Yeah, hi. She's just staring at me

03:09:23.760 --> 03:09:25.760
Yeah

03:09:27.840 --> 03:09:29.840
Taking this bunny with me

03:09:30.720 --> 03:09:35.520
Fiya, can you please not chew on my cables? Thank you. Ah Fiya. Look what you've done

03:09:37.600 --> 03:09:39.600
Hey, where am I going?

03:09:41.520 --> 03:09:43.840
I want to claim this entire inside area

03:09:48.240 --> 03:09:54.240
Hello little girl, would you like a pet picture, you know, you know Betty

03:09:56.000 --> 03:09:58.960
She's like desperately trying to go into my lap and I'm like girl

03:09:59.840 --> 03:10:01.840
Oh

03:10:03.840 --> 03:10:07.120
Why are you so snuggly she's such a snuggly girl lady

03:10:11.520 --> 03:10:14.560
Okay, where am I? Okay, we're almost there

03:10:16.880 --> 03:10:18.880
Almost fucking there

03:10:21.040 --> 03:10:23.040
Thank you. Hello, welcome in

03:10:24.480 --> 03:10:28.320
Oh, fuck. I was not even paying attention. There was a fucking bison in front of me

03:10:30.640 --> 03:10:38.880
Okay, it really doesn't matter which hacks I go into

03:10:42.320 --> 03:10:46.160
Look at these mises I'm gonna piss right next to them to assert dominance

03:10:51.680 --> 03:10:53.680
Wow, that's great that a den is nearby

03:10:54.640 --> 03:10:58.800
Why are you talking to Fiya? Oh, yeah, was that Boomi?

03:11:02.080 --> 03:11:04.320
Um, what?

03:11:07.520 --> 03:11:10.800
Okay, I need one more fucking hex

03:11:14.400 --> 03:11:16.400
Am I going the right way? Okay

03:11:23.840 --> 03:11:28.800
Rock piss in time. Oh my god

03:11:31.040 --> 03:11:33.040
Cat lost it

03:11:33.680 --> 03:11:36.880
Boomi's laying in the bed and Fiya wants to lay in the bed with him

03:11:38.320 --> 03:11:41.840
Very cool. And then Boomi just pushed her off my desk

03:11:46.960 --> 03:11:49.280
Pop maxing is going coming along slowly

03:11:49.280 --> 03:11:53.360
Okay, I'm running around the rabbit in my mouth

03:11:55.680 --> 03:11:58.080
What what are you doing?

03:11:59.760 --> 03:12:01.760
Why are you freaking up? Hi Boomi

03:12:02.000 --> 03:12:05.760
You're just an epi boy. You're so you're bigger than this bed now. Holy crap

03:12:06.160 --> 03:12:10.720
Hey, I mean, you're a new boy. You could just feet right in you. You know you're two beings

03:12:11.680 --> 03:12:17.600
Are she break? I don't know I heard something crash

03:12:18.800 --> 03:12:22.560
She's like I think she's trying to jump up on something. It just didn't work out

03:12:23.200 --> 03:12:25.200
Let me have a munch. Thank you

03:12:26.880 --> 03:12:28.880
Okay, I filled up 15 hexes

03:12:36.240 --> 03:12:38.640
I must have at least 15 hexes at this time

03:12:39.360 --> 03:12:41.360
What the fuck

03:12:43.600 --> 03:12:46.320
Why is this on easy and it's more difficult

03:12:50.480 --> 03:12:56.640
I have to find the densites. Oh actually just yeah, I'm gonna pass out right here

03:13:09.600 --> 03:13:11.600
Oh

03:13:17.200 --> 03:13:23.360
Okay, it doesn't mean walk in front of my screen mister. Yeah, you can sit there. That's fine. Listen on my keyboard

03:13:24.320 --> 03:13:26.320
um

03:13:39.600 --> 03:13:41.600
Which way the fuck is this thing?

03:13:45.120 --> 03:13:47.120
Come on by on a call

03:13:48.800 --> 03:13:55.440
It is probably should be I'm not running at full speed all the time Boomi is staring at my wolf on my screen and trying to bap it

03:13:58.000 --> 03:14:04.400
Then nearby Boomi, can you find the den? Can you not play with my wires though sweetness?

03:14:05.200 --> 03:14:07.200
I

03:14:07.760 --> 03:14:11.760
Think you're right. Whoever said dens always face south

03:14:13.120 --> 03:14:18.480
Um, I feel like if I went back on the opposite direction, I'd be able to find it. Boomi. I can't see

03:14:20.560 --> 03:14:23.040
I'm gonna let you get down. Can you

03:14:24.480 --> 03:14:26.480
And so can you move?

03:14:27.280 --> 03:14:29.280
Can you get down?

03:14:30.160 --> 03:14:32.160
I

03:14:32.720 --> 03:14:34.720
Please

03:14:36.640 --> 03:14:40.880
Beggin you bro. Thank you. Boomi the den sniffer

03:14:50.640 --> 03:14:57.200
Come on, come on, come on. I want I'm just like it's gonna I wish it didn't fade so fast like

03:14:58.160 --> 03:15:00.160
The um

03:15:00.240 --> 03:15:02.240
Why'd you just place your paw on my hand?

03:15:02.720 --> 03:15:06.320
Boomi, what's up, dude? Do you want to be held? What do you want?

03:15:07.200 --> 03:15:08.800
Come here

03:15:08.800 --> 03:15:11.520
Oh big boy. Oh, you're so big

03:15:12.880 --> 03:15:14.080
Hi

03:15:14.080 --> 03:15:15.680
You're gonna shit

03:15:15.680 --> 03:15:17.680
You're just hanging out

03:15:18.800 --> 03:15:20.800
You're so warm

03:15:21.600 --> 03:15:23.600
Hi

03:15:24.080 --> 03:15:26.160
He's like sitting on my lap like he's a kid

03:15:27.840 --> 03:15:29.840
He just sits like a woman

03:15:30.320 --> 03:15:32.320
Boomi's trying to tell me the secret den location

03:15:33.920 --> 03:15:35.920
You're trying to tell me the secret den location

03:15:37.600 --> 03:15:39.600
No

03:15:40.160 --> 03:15:48.160
He just got a fucking limp in my arms. Okay. Um, here let me put you in the bed. Oh my god, you're so heavy

03:15:48.560 --> 03:15:55.760
He's also really interested in my headphones because he wants to play with them

03:15:58.080 --> 03:16:05.280
No, you cannot have go away. You also just took my headphone out of my ear

03:16:05.280 --> 03:16:16.400
Okay, I didn't mean to sit

03:16:17.280 --> 03:16:22.400
No, it's not the most depressed. All right. There's one fucking hex. Yeah one

03:16:22.480 --> 03:16:29.120
I feel like the hexes should last longer than when I fall asleep. They're not just fucking gone because that's also just not realistic

03:16:35.360 --> 03:16:37.360
This game isn't realistic enough

03:16:40.400 --> 03:16:44.160
Oh, I'm going the wrong fucking way. Okay, almost there

03:16:53.120 --> 03:16:58.960
The house is what boomi the cat is this house is people no boomi is bumi

03:17:00.320 --> 03:17:03.840
For because he's the king of umashu. I'm just gonna fucking pee anywhere

03:17:05.280 --> 03:17:07.280
Okay

03:17:10.640 --> 03:17:12.640
Okay, let's go south

03:17:15.760 --> 03:17:17.760
Let me just

03:17:18.720 --> 03:17:20.720
Then nearby

03:17:22.480 --> 03:17:24.480
I wish I would just show up in a marker

03:17:28.080 --> 03:17:32.560
I lost it already this way because wait

03:17:35.280 --> 03:17:37.280
I

03:17:44.000 --> 03:17:46.000
Yeah, this is the right color

03:17:49.760 --> 03:17:51.760
At it

03:17:51.840 --> 03:17:57.920
Please be a den. No, it's just a fucking rock. Um, I face the south

03:17:58.480 --> 03:18:00.480
I

03:18:02.080 --> 03:18:08.160
Feels like it should be like right over here the snow is getting in my eyes

03:18:14.400 --> 03:18:23.440
This oh, it's just another big rock. It's not a boner. It's a rock. It's a rock over here

03:18:24.320 --> 03:18:29.840
Am I getting clenope it turned? Okay over here

03:18:33.200 --> 03:18:40.480
Guys I'm not going crazy right like what it's supposed to then discover what the fuck

03:18:42.160 --> 03:18:44.160
Oh, what?

03:18:46.000 --> 03:18:51.920
How the fuck am I supposed to see that this is just a pile of fucking snow, dude

03:18:54.320 --> 03:18:56.320
What

03:19:00.000 --> 03:19:05.760
Okay, because I'm like how am I supposed to find any dens and I'm looking for like like a pile of sticks or rocks like in

03:19:05.760 --> 03:19:07.760
The form of a den shape

03:19:08.320 --> 03:19:11.680
I guess because that's what it looks like in the game like before when I played it

03:19:11.680 --> 03:19:13.360
it was just like usually

03:19:13.360 --> 03:19:18.320
Usually looks like this and you would turn on the other side and then there's like a little hole in this and that's where you

03:19:18.320 --> 03:19:23.680
Would have the pops and shit. Okay. Well, let's find others. I guess and pee on the way

03:19:27.840 --> 03:19:29.840
Um

03:19:30.560 --> 03:19:33.920
Because I'm closest to this one over here. I'm just gonna go

03:19:39.360 --> 03:19:42.240
Start global warming. Hello, welcome in

03:19:43.600 --> 03:19:45.600
We are wolves

03:19:45.840 --> 03:19:50.080
Because I'm gonna play that song if anybody clips me can you play the we are wolves?

03:19:50.320 --> 03:19:53.280
We run as one or whatever

03:19:54.160 --> 03:19:56.160
However, fuck it goes

03:19:56.880 --> 03:19:58.880
I'm gonna piss in your fucking thing

03:20:04.080 --> 03:20:06.080
Ah, bitch I got

03:20:08.000 --> 03:20:14.400
Okay, now I have just have to look for uneven patches of snow on the ground that'll make it a lot easier that's for sure

03:20:15.840 --> 03:20:17.840
You

03:20:28.640 --> 03:20:32.080
Okay as many hexes in a short term as possible

03:20:34.560 --> 03:20:36.560
Okay

03:20:39.440 --> 03:20:42.160
All right, gotcha

03:20:45.920 --> 03:20:50.320
I don't like how they took that red. I don't feel like hunting for their marks

03:20:50.320 --> 03:20:54.320
So we're gonna look for the dens the dens are the priority. We're just gonna run around

03:20:55.920 --> 03:20:57.920
And look for dens

03:21:01.440 --> 03:21:03.440
This is literally

03:21:03.440 --> 03:21:09.760
I didn't think we'd take this long to just pop max. It's it's pop slow right now. It's pop. We're pop minning

03:21:13.120 --> 03:21:15.120
Where am I

03:21:16.240 --> 03:21:18.240
I

03:21:19.760 --> 03:21:21.760
Can I pee

03:21:26.800 --> 03:21:30.960
Um, yeah, it's actually good that I'm I can just run through and piss on places

03:21:31.920 --> 03:21:34.640
But then I have to make sure I'm in the right fucking hex to do it

03:21:37.200 --> 03:21:39.200
This is a dumb game mechanic

03:21:39.760 --> 03:21:42.800
I will tell you that dead nearby. All right dead nearby guys

03:21:43.440 --> 03:21:48.160
Keep an eye out for weird shit. Give me this fucking rabbit. I'm hungry. Yo

03:21:52.400 --> 03:21:54.960
You want that I wish I could like feed him

03:21:58.480 --> 03:22:04.480
Where's the den where's the den am I in the right spot? I don't know. Okay again

03:22:04.640 --> 03:22:14.160
Um, oh, okay, okay, I'm just gonna walk slowly

03:22:18.480 --> 03:22:20.480
This is so stupid

03:22:22.000 --> 03:22:24.000
Okay, we're getting warmer

03:22:25.280 --> 03:22:27.280
We're very warm

03:22:27.600 --> 03:22:30.720
Do you guys see any misshapen snow on the ground?

03:22:35.280 --> 03:22:37.280
No, it's over here

03:22:45.200 --> 03:22:47.200
I don't is that one

03:22:50.960 --> 03:22:52.960
Oh, see it looks like this shit

03:22:56.880 --> 03:22:59.280
Oh, okay, see this looks like an actual fucking den

03:22:59.680 --> 03:23:08.560
I got a den max for the pep max. That's exactly right. Yeah, turn on a fucking late max. I can't reach

03:23:15.200 --> 03:23:17.200
Now that's a den

03:23:18.240 --> 03:23:20.240
That's a den if I've ever seen one

03:23:21.280 --> 03:23:23.280
Oh, there's thank yous over here

03:23:24.320 --> 03:23:27.360
There is really is green tea. What is this?

03:23:27.760 --> 03:23:32.880
It looks like this isn't in English. It looks like seaweed popcorn

03:23:35.840 --> 03:23:38.640
But it smells like caramel, but it looks like it has seaweed on it. What is this?

03:23:45.600 --> 03:23:48.960
It tastes like peanut brittle. No, it tastes like caramel corn. Oh, it's pretty good

03:23:52.320 --> 03:23:54.320
Look rice puffs

03:23:55.200 --> 03:23:57.200
It's in Korean so I can't read it

03:23:59.360 --> 03:24:06.400
Oh, it's like lightly caramelized rice puffs with like little like little burnt pieces like a marshmallow

03:24:10.320 --> 03:24:12.320
Hey, that's pretty good

03:24:16.400 --> 03:24:18.400
Oh shit, there's another high chew in here

03:24:18.400 --> 03:24:26.320
Yeah, whoever drives this is Elder Scrolls fan

03:24:28.640 --> 03:24:30.720
Maybe you never know

03:24:33.440 --> 03:24:35.440
I want you on this high too

03:24:38.960 --> 03:24:40.960
I'm tangled up in wires

03:24:48.640 --> 03:24:53.760
Okay, I am pretty tired

03:25:02.560 --> 03:25:04.800
I wish I could just make that the den because it looks badass

03:25:13.200 --> 03:25:16.000
What a shot I take a picture

03:25:18.800 --> 03:25:20.800
Gorgeous

03:25:27.200 --> 03:25:29.200
Hi boomie

03:25:30.800 --> 03:25:38.960
Okay, let's see the fucking damage Jesus Christ this purple pack is taking over holy shit

03:25:42.480 --> 03:25:44.480
Oh my god

03:25:44.720 --> 03:25:48.000
I need to steal some hexes back. Oh my god Jesus

03:25:54.160 --> 03:25:56.160
Um

03:25:56.880 --> 03:25:58.880
Let's see I should probably go

03:26:01.360 --> 03:26:03.360
This way towards that one

03:26:05.200 --> 03:26:10.160
Right it's coming out right in purple or fucking in it to win it

03:26:10.800 --> 03:26:12.800
Speed it up

03:26:13.520 --> 03:26:17.040
Look at him look at me lovingly as we run. He's not even watching where he's going

03:26:18.080 --> 03:26:20.080
I'm happy I picked

03:26:20.080 --> 03:26:22.080
Vynautical, you know

03:26:22.080 --> 03:26:23.280
He's a good guy

03:26:23.280 --> 03:26:25.280
Made am I in the

03:26:27.040 --> 03:26:29.520
I want to make sure I go down to this one first

03:26:35.440 --> 03:26:37.440
I wish there was like a den

03:26:38.160 --> 03:26:45.040
I wish there was like a den in each. Oh, no, that's fine little hex so I wouldn't have to worry so much

03:26:48.800 --> 03:26:51.680
Jesus well actually I can cut down the middle between these

03:26:56.160 --> 03:27:02.000
Why does it take me forever to cross into my own territory wait did I just go in the wrong direction? Okay, I know I did

03:27:08.400 --> 03:27:10.400
Okay, I think I could piss

03:27:27.040 --> 03:27:34.320
Okay, cool, that's great and then I can go up to this one make sure I'm going up though. No, I'm going down

03:27:35.280 --> 03:27:37.280

Den nearby den nearby everybody slow down grab the wall

03:27:53.520 --> 03:27:55.520
Is it this way?

03:27:56.320 --> 03:27:58.320
Nope this way

03:27:58.960 --> 03:28:00.960
Den nearby

03:28:01.360 --> 03:28:03.360
Trying to find the direction

03:28:06.080 --> 03:28:11.120
Color is not changing. Oh now it is. All right, we're getting a little warmer

03:28:15.680 --> 03:28:23.040
Oh, we are on fire is it that over there? I'm gonna hope these let it be it

03:28:25.200 --> 03:28:27.200
No, this is just a rock

03:28:28.400 --> 03:28:32.000
Again, it's just a rock. Wait, how is this a den? Oh that

03:28:33.520 --> 03:28:36.800
Oh, I see you see how hard this is how the fuck am I supposed to see that?

03:28:40.400 --> 03:28:42.400
Okay, I already peed here can I pee again?

03:28:45.120 --> 03:28:47.120
This is a good den site though

03:28:59.200 --> 03:29:01.200
All right, I mean

03:29:03.040 --> 03:29:05.440
This way yes this way

03:29:07.680 --> 03:29:12.240
Bro, you fits in that. I don't know. It's like really hard to like to

03:29:14.720 --> 03:29:20.640
Catch them because they're like in weird places. They don't they're not like immediately obvious or highlighted

03:29:20.800 --> 03:29:22.800
I

03:29:25.760 --> 03:29:30.560
Also might take a purple slot just because they're getting a little bit too frisky for me. There's another den nearby

03:29:31.680 --> 03:29:32.720
What?

03:29:32.720 --> 03:29:34.720
You're fucking with me. Where?

03:29:35.840 --> 03:29:37.840
Where's the den?

03:29:38.720 --> 03:29:41.200
Why am I suddenly now coming across all the dens?

03:29:41.200 --> 03:29:43.200

03:29:48.320 --> 03:29:55.200
The right direction I can't really tell this is the right right nope. It's not about this way

03:30:04.240 --> 03:30:07.920
Okay, is there gonna be one in the middle of nothing over here? I don't

03:30:08.320 --> 03:30:10.320
I

03:30:17.440 --> 03:30:23.520
Don't want a den so close to them. Hello. Oh, didn't I already discover this one?

03:30:25.520 --> 03:30:31.120
What the are they all just deciding to show up? I don't I'm quite pissed

03:30:31.520 --> 03:30:33.520
I

03:30:35.200 --> 03:30:40.080
Don't think I want one on the edge of the territory why why have you just started some fries some chicken

03:30:40.080 --> 03:30:42.400
I know he's not he's not pissing as much as I thought he would

03:30:45.200 --> 03:30:47.200
Okay, we're we're pretty strong over here

03:30:54.320 --> 03:30:56.320
Um

03:30:56.640 --> 03:30:58.640
Oh

03:30:59.040 --> 03:31:01.040

03:31:02.480 --> 03:31:04.480
All right, I'm taking this fucking one over here

03:31:06.720 --> 03:31:08.720
Where is it?

03:31:09.440 --> 03:31:11.440
Oh

03:31:12.080 --> 03:31:20.560
Male dispersal moves. Here. Here. Here. Here. Here's your fucking marker. It's mine

03:31:21.360 --> 03:31:23.360
In the center

03:31:24.880 --> 03:31:34.320
Why am I getting an autosave? It's because there's moose right here. I don't care about the moose. I care about the piss

03:31:38.000 --> 03:31:40.000
I go up here

03:31:40.240 --> 03:31:42.240
Why can't I find?

03:31:46.320 --> 03:31:48.880
What the fuck is this hex I buy an article

03:31:50.560 --> 03:31:52.560
I

03:32:11.520 --> 03:32:13.520
Know we're good

03:32:14.640 --> 03:32:19.600
We weakened it but it doesn't seem that it wants to let us take it

03:32:21.280 --> 03:32:28.320
Let me how much piss do I have in my body I can piss so much

03:32:29.120 --> 03:32:31.120
There's me saying pissing. I don't want it

03:32:33.600 --> 03:32:39.360
Hmm, I can't find their marker. So maybe it I don't do I just have to piss another spot

03:32:43.360 --> 03:32:45.760
All right, I'm just gonna piss everywhere. How about that?

03:32:50.560 --> 03:32:57.440
It just keeps doing the fucking noise, but it's not changing color and it should be because it's at 50%

03:33:00.560 --> 03:33:02.560
There's no site sent marker

03:33:05.360 --> 03:33:07.760
We're not really that hungry so I don't have to worry about that right now

03:33:10.240 --> 03:33:14.000
Well, and now we're in their territory and I don't want to go that far

03:33:21.440 --> 03:33:26.240
I thought I heard a wolf grow

03:33:30.880 --> 03:33:32.880
This is stupid

03:33:34.320 --> 03:33:39.920
Okay, so on this little baby tree. Let me take over this spot

03:33:44.080 --> 03:33:49.920

03:33:51.520 --> 03:33:57.840
And you hunt and you raise puppies. How the fuck did I get over here again? I went in the wrong direction

03:34:02.160 --> 03:34:04.160
Pissing over here

03:34:09.840 --> 03:34:12.400
I am piss maxing right now

03:34:14.720 --> 03:34:16.720

03:34:17.200 --> 03:34:23.200
Get him. I got him. I got him. We're eating good tonight, baby

03:34:26.080 --> 03:34:30.480

03:34:32.400 --> 03:34:37.120
Oh my god, lovely. Oh, I didn't mean to fucking jump, but okay. Can I slow down?

03:34:40.480 --> 03:34:44.000

03:34:47.680 --> 03:34:54.000
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. Oh fuck

03:34:56.000 --> 03:34:58.000
Damn

03:34:58.480 --> 03:35:00.480
And it sucks because we need to sleep

03:35:02.080 --> 03:35:06.080
Okay, I don't have to eat um very good. Let me how

03:35:08.320 --> 03:35:10.320
Mark the spot

03:35:14.160 --> 03:35:16.160
It's impressively bad pathing

03:35:16.800 --> 03:35:18.800
Listen

03:35:20.720 --> 03:35:24.880
Trying my best out here look at this fucking little guy. It's a little little eagle hanging out

03:35:32.800 --> 03:35:34.800
I'm wondering if I shouldn't

03:35:35.440 --> 03:35:39.760
Be running as much but I don't really think stamina has to do with my exhaustion. It doesn't

03:35:40.560 --> 03:35:42.560
Seem to be that much affected by it

03:35:44.320 --> 03:35:46.320
I'm taking over this hex

03:35:46.720 --> 03:35:48.720
I

03:36:03.120 --> 03:36:05.120
The fuck is howling

03:36:05.120 --> 03:36:11.520
Oh, it's the raiding and I'm pissing everywhere. Oh god high raiders. I'm peeing all over the place. Don't look

03:36:12.160 --> 03:36:14.160

How is the stream I knew you

03:36:19.920 --> 03:36:21.680

I'm not a mom. I'm not a furry

03:36:24.400 --> 03:36:26.960
I'm just being a wolf man

03:36:28.080 --> 03:36:30.080
Peeler never been in the allocations

03:36:33.120 --> 03:36:35.120
Oh my god, I'm waiting to class

03:36:35.200 --> 03:36:36.800
Collapse from exhaustion

03:36:36.800 --> 03:36:43.280
But hi raiders. We're playing wolf quest and I'm she be by the way if you don't know who I am if you don't then you're weird

03:36:43.920 --> 03:36:45.920

And I'm pissing marking my territory with my husband the binautical

03:36:51.200 --> 03:36:52.800
um

03:36:52.800 --> 03:36:56.800
We're looking for another den so we can raise our puppies

03:36:57.920 --> 03:37:00.800
Before winter. Oh look at that fucking elk and we can also hunt

03:37:01.920 --> 03:37:04.320
I'm not that hungry though. So I don't have to hunt him but

03:37:04.960 --> 03:37:06.960
It's a big fucking elk

03:37:07.440 --> 03:37:09.280
Shall we get it?

03:37:09.280 --> 03:37:12.400
I kind of want to show off for the boys. I kind of want to show off for the boys

03:37:13.280 --> 03:37:15.280
Oh, he sees us. Fuck

Oh, maybe he doesn't

03:37:17.520 --> 03:37:21.360
Keep sneaking honey. He's in love with me so much. He can't keep his eyes off me, but it's fine

03:37:23.280 --> 03:37:25.280

03:37:44.000 --> 03:37:46.720
Why am I doing all the work? Usually he's better than this

03:37:48.480 --> 03:37:50.480
There we go. We got each leg

03:37:51.520 --> 03:37:53.200
Oh

03:37:53.200 --> 03:37:55.200

03:37:56.320 --> 03:37:59.280
No, we got him. Come on. We can finish him off

03:38:00.320 --> 03:38:03.120
We can finish him off. Why am I my camera is all fucked up

03:38:04.880 --> 03:38:06.880

03:38:07.440 --> 03:38:09.440

03:38:10.720 --> 03:38:13.200
I brought my jog up ruse. It's okay. Don't worry about it

03:38:18.080 --> 03:38:20.080

Ground by the throat ground by the throat ground by the throat. We're getting him. We're killing him

03:38:24.960 --> 03:38:26.960
It's all right. We're good

My mate is kind of being useless right now, but it's fine. Can honey stop looking? I should actually help

03:38:33.040 --> 03:38:35.040
He's just so much in love with me

03:38:36.000 --> 03:38:38.000
I

03:38:39.760 --> 03:38:44.480
Also don't have a lot of stamina so I can't hold on to him that for that long. He's really just walking around

03:38:48.400 --> 03:38:50.400
Okay, grab a leg

03:38:52.640 --> 03:38:55.280

Look at that. I got yeah fucking steak. You want some of this shit? You guys want this you want to bite?

03:39:20.480 --> 03:39:23.200
That's that's how I do it. I'm a real alpha

03:39:23.680 --> 03:39:24.720
You know

03:39:24.720 --> 03:39:29.680
Not like these posers out here by a nautical is debating why he married me because he's like

03:39:30.080 --> 03:39:32.080
Why did you put us in the situation?

03:39:36.000 --> 03:39:43.120
Is it possible to get your wolf strong enough to one shot everything? I don't think so. Well, you can again you can scale stuff in here

03:39:44.560 --> 03:39:46.560
I need to find wait

03:39:48.560 --> 03:39:52.160
I need 15 hexes. Oh, I did find four densites. Um

03:39:54.240 --> 03:39:58.960
Because you get like perks and shit, which I don't know how that works what perks you get

03:39:59.520 --> 03:40:01.040
um, but

03:40:01.040 --> 03:40:06.480
So far I have negative strength and negative health, but I have speed and stamina. That's why I'm fast as fuck when I run

03:40:08.080 --> 03:40:10.080
Uh, I go really fast

03:40:10.080 --> 03:40:15.600
Alpha she being her boy wife. Yes boy wife and girl boss. Is this a multiplayer? It is multiplayer

03:40:16.240 --> 03:40:19.840
I I don't I haven't played multiplayer in a while when I remember playing

03:40:19.840 --> 03:40:24.080
I think you kind of five people in it, but I don't I wonder if it's more now that you could do

03:40:24.720 --> 03:40:26.960
Um, I have to sleep now

03:40:27.200 --> 03:40:33.360
Bro, oh my god purple pack is fucking us so bad that we have to sleep

03:40:37.360 --> 03:40:39.360
I think it's eight now. Oh that'd be sick

03:40:41.920 --> 03:40:43.920
Guys want to play with me in wolf quest

03:40:45.440 --> 03:40:50.080
I love by the time we wake up, uh, everything will be fucking gone. There'll probably be a bear next to us

03:40:50.240 --> 03:40:52.560
I want to be surprised. Is there a bear?

03:40:53.920 --> 03:40:55.920
No, all right

03:40:57.520 --> 03:40:59.520
I'm running too fast

03:41:00.640 --> 03:41:06.320
See the damage. Okay, it's not that bad. It's not that bad. We're fine

03:41:09.520 --> 03:41:13.040
We are going to look how big the moon is over there

03:41:17.360 --> 03:41:21.360
We're fucking yapping we're gonna go up and then across

03:41:23.440 --> 03:41:25.440
What uh

03:41:26.000 --> 03:41:30.160
Or all these coyotes just hanging out it's kind of weird. They're just like waiting for us to leave I guess

03:41:35.120 --> 03:41:37.120
Or being chased by the coyotes, I don't

03:41:39.840 --> 03:41:41.840
What the hell

03:41:44.080 --> 03:41:46.080
I don't even know I don't they must

03:41:48.160 --> 03:41:50.160
They're very loud

03:41:50.400 --> 03:41:55.280
The alert girls from a pack. Oh that'd be fun. What's our pack? I don't even have a pack name

03:41:55.840 --> 03:41:59.360
It doesn't let you name the pack. I think when I get puppies, I can name the pack

03:42:01.520 --> 03:42:03.200
Okay, we're almost there

03:42:03.200 --> 03:42:06.400
Let me have to find their fucking scent marker and take back the hexagon

03:42:07.280 --> 03:42:09.280
I feel like I'm playing like

03:42:09.280 --> 03:42:11.280
What is that game?

03:42:11.280 --> 03:42:14.080
Strutego or fucking risk. I don't remember

03:42:16.320 --> 03:42:18.320
Oh my god, strutego though

03:42:18.320 --> 03:42:20.320
I remember playing that

03:42:20.400 --> 03:42:22.320
Okay, we have to find the scent marker

03:42:22.320 --> 03:42:27.440
So we got like smell a vision which is pretty cool smell a vision allows us to

03:42:29.600 --> 03:42:31.600
Okay, where's their marker

03:42:33.280 --> 03:42:36.560
Why do I smell a skull the fuck that's kind of weird

03:42:38.960 --> 03:42:42.160
Um, we have to find their scent marker so we can write over it

03:42:43.840 --> 03:42:45.840
I'm gonna piss right here

03:42:46.800 --> 03:42:48.800
I

03:42:51.840 --> 03:42:53.840
Don't even know what their strength is that

03:42:55.280 --> 03:42:57.280
For the piss

03:42:57.600 --> 03:43:01.120
Sellers of katana. Actually, yeah, it's that's more apt

03:43:05.840 --> 03:43:09.680
I don't know how I don't see a marker. Wait, did I just see one?

03:43:12.240 --> 03:43:14.240
No, I'm just fucking tripping

03:43:14.960 --> 03:43:16.720
Because it's

03:43:16.720 --> 03:43:18.720
What is that?

03:43:18.720 --> 03:43:20.720
Oh, it's a carcass. I smell

03:43:21.920 --> 03:43:24.640
Like what does the x stand for because usually it's like

03:43:25.680 --> 03:43:30.240
It'll be a purple marker and they don't have a lot of colors in here just right here

03:43:34.960 --> 03:43:37.280
Renew that then we're back in here

03:43:38.160 --> 03:43:43.600
This is really just pissing simulator

03:43:46.960 --> 03:43:49.760
Okay, we're taking this back though just good

03:43:51.040 --> 03:43:55.920
So yeah, you can take stuff back by like howling peeing and just your presence there

03:43:56.880 --> 03:44:02.880
We have to get 15 hexes at at least 50 strength in order for us to have puppies

03:44:03.840 --> 03:44:05.840
Hi boomie

03:44:08.240 --> 03:44:12.240
And I'm trying to take over this fucking hexagon because they stole it from me from before

03:44:13.200 --> 03:44:16.080
I think if we go up this way we should be good

03:44:20.080 --> 03:44:24.160
It's funny because I haven't seen any other wolves you think you'd see them like renewing shit

03:44:26.080 --> 03:44:31.280
Boomy sweetie, what are you doing? It's like so she's sitting on my desk and staring at nothing

03:44:32.240 --> 03:44:38.560
Oh my god purple pack stop being assholes

03:44:43.600 --> 03:44:45.600
Something like this for for wild cats

03:44:46.720 --> 03:44:48.000
Uh

03:44:48.000 --> 03:44:54.000
What is that is it like two hearts? I think there is a game like this for cats and I forget because I used to play that one

03:44:54.000 --> 03:44:56.000
too when I was younger

03:44:56.000 --> 03:44:58.880
Oh, yeah, I think I peed on top of this or I wanted to last time

03:44:59.840 --> 03:45:06.560
Yeah, this will be the scent marker spot. Let's fucking go piss

03:45:09.040 --> 03:45:15.600
Too soon relax. All right, then we're gonna go up boomy sweetie. I can't see past your girth

03:45:16.800 --> 03:45:18.800
Your booty's in the way

03:45:22.240 --> 03:45:26.080
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, we pissed off this cool tree

03:45:26.640 --> 03:45:29.680
That's right cool tree pissing

03:45:34.400 --> 03:45:39.120
It's a sick ass tree. See this would be a den site and you have like a little den in here like come on

03:45:42.080 --> 03:45:44.720
The opportunity was there. Okay, I did not

03:45:50.880 --> 03:45:52.880
I'll even show my sun markers

03:45:56.560 --> 03:46:02.080
Yes, excuse me. What my cat's food is going off

03:46:05.120 --> 03:46:09.920
What was it straw? He said in a call a camera. Yeah, I was on the call

03:46:11.200 --> 03:46:17.600
Um, she's like, you know who my favorite character is in your streams and I'm like who she's like your cat's food dispenser going off

03:46:19.840 --> 03:46:24.720
And she's because it like I forget if you're like having a meeting around the time it goes off in the afternoon

03:46:25.680 --> 03:46:27.360
and

03:46:27.360 --> 03:46:29.360
What the fuck didn't I just mark that?

03:46:31.920 --> 03:46:36.160
And um, it went off and like totally

03:46:37.600 --> 03:46:39.600
Uh surprise everybody

03:46:43.360 --> 03:46:45.360
Let me just cross into mine real quick

03:46:47.520 --> 03:46:51.440
Perfect. I'm just gonna literally on the edge of glory just pissing everywhere

03:46:55.680 --> 03:46:59.600
Am I done yet? Like did I beat the fucking?

03:47:02.800 --> 03:47:06.800
I needed them at 50 50 strength. Oh my god

03:47:12.880 --> 03:47:19.600
Okay, then I literally just have to go to the ones on the top and do that. Okay fine. Hopefully they'll let us finish

03:47:20.240 --> 03:47:27.520
Because I'm tired of running around I've literally been running around peeing for like the last two hours

03:47:28.800 --> 03:47:31.760
This is my least favorite part of this game is the hex

03:47:32.720 --> 03:47:34.560
game mechanic

03:47:34.560 --> 03:47:38.160
Because things should not run out after four fictional hours

03:47:39.600 --> 03:47:41.600
When your wolf sleeps for eight

03:47:42.960 --> 03:47:44.960
Go up here

03:47:49.680 --> 03:47:54.560
And it takes such a long time to run across a hex

03:47:55.760 --> 03:47:57.760
Need a dispenser as a cast

03:47:59.520 --> 03:48:01.520
I thought you were finishing like hair in this week

03:48:13.280 --> 03:48:15.280
So close

03:48:15.280 --> 03:48:17.280
I can almost taste it

03:48:17.280 --> 03:48:19.280
Release your inhibition

03:48:20.240 --> 03:48:22.240
cool

03:48:28.480 --> 03:48:36.660
That's cool. Okay, perfect and then I can just cross into this one. All right, I'm on the edge. Perfect

03:48:47.920 --> 03:48:54.560
Perfect. Okay. You've established a good territory. I found several potential dents. You and your mate are truly a pack now

03:48:54.560 --> 03:48:56.800
So give your pack a name or ask for suggestions

03:48:59.440 --> 03:49:03.680
Don't include pack a name as that will be added automatically suggest a name rebel pack

03:49:04.160 --> 03:49:07.520
Tofacious pack prowler pack that sounds creepy as fuck

03:49:11.200 --> 03:49:14.160
Fang pack hope creek pack that sounds pretty cool actually

03:49:14.800 --> 03:49:20.960
Overlook fossil forest sleet galaxy slit stone ayo

03:49:21.920 --> 03:49:23.920
Woke up

03:49:24.320 --> 03:49:26.320
Why do you give me slit stone twice? Pawsome

03:49:27.440 --> 03:49:32.080
Hush, what are these fucking names pouncer pack? Why are they like tofacious so much?

03:49:32.720 --> 03:49:36.480
Whitewater whitewater possum scar blizzard yogurt

03:49:37.760 --> 03:49:39.600
Yogurt pack

03:49:39.600 --> 03:49:42.400
The bum hunters pack pack his pack

03:49:43.360 --> 03:49:45.360
I'm bringing piss pack

03:49:46.320 --> 03:49:48.880
I'm bringing sexy pack. Okay. I think that's a good name

03:49:50.400 --> 03:49:52.400
I think that's a great name

03:49:54.000 --> 03:49:57.280
I'm bringing sexy

03:50:01.040 --> 03:50:03.200
But except instead of back it's pack

03:50:06.000 --> 03:50:09.440
Can I do a comma? No, I'm bringing sexy pack

03:50:12.640 --> 03:50:14.640
Choose a den

03:50:15.200 --> 03:50:17.200
Oh, fuck

03:50:17.200 --> 03:50:19.520
You've established a territory in the slopes of anthos mountain

03:50:19.520 --> 03:50:23.600
But remember you must maintain it even when your pups require all your time and attention great

03:50:23.920 --> 03:50:28.320
Smaller your territory the more likely stranger wolves be tempted to come in and kill your pups great

03:50:28.720 --> 03:50:32.720
It's most efficient mercury when hexes have dropped to 30 or 40 strength

03:50:33.040 --> 03:50:35.200
Plane your hunting trips so you can mark hexes along the way

03:50:36.880 --> 03:50:39.440
I don't think actual wolves have to deal with this

03:50:39.440 --> 03:50:47.920
Find a den. Okay. I haven't gotten this far since I played the game a long time ago

03:50:48.800 --> 03:50:53.280
So we'll see you see that twitter torrent of youtube or animations dancing to that song

03:50:53.840 --> 03:50:56.320
Yes, I did. That's why I put in a sexy pack

03:50:57.280 --> 03:50:59.280
I'm bringing sexy pack

03:50:59.680 --> 03:51:01.680
yet

03:51:01.680 --> 03:51:05.200
Your pups will be born soon and the snows begin to melt it's time to find a good dead site

03:51:05.280 --> 03:51:08.160
There's no need to dig a new dent for yourself since there are many potential sites out there

03:51:10.000 --> 03:51:12.000
Cool, cool, cool

03:51:12.000 --> 03:51:15.360
How to find a den they look different now the snow is melted

03:51:19.120 --> 03:51:22.720
Okay, now dens will emit float scents like before why didn't they do that before

03:51:23.600 --> 03:51:28.640
Remember the dens are always in south facing slopes to catch as much as the spring sunshine. That's very cool. I didn't know that

03:51:30.320 --> 03:51:34.720
Um, okay, so the they should already be marked for me

03:51:34.960 --> 03:51:42.640
Show all dens. Oh, they're all down there. I'd rather have one up here are in the middle

03:51:45.120 --> 03:51:48.320
I think I'm gonna try to find one towards the middle

03:51:50.400 --> 03:51:52.400
I didn't mean to pee but that's fine

03:51:55.360 --> 03:51:57.360
It's fine

03:52:02.080 --> 03:52:04.080
I should probably

03:52:05.440 --> 03:52:07.440
Yeah, let's go across

03:52:08.640 --> 03:52:12.320
I'm gonna try to find a den up here. I want one in the middle of the hexes

03:52:13.600 --> 03:52:15.600
So I can just go into a circle when I want to

03:52:19.920 --> 03:52:21.920
It's pop max in time

03:52:24.400 --> 03:52:28.960
Oh look at the bison they'll probably fucking kill us. I'm how am I going the wrong way?

03:52:30.080 --> 03:52:32.160
That doesn't make any fucking sense to me

03:52:34.720 --> 03:52:36.720
I

03:52:44.720 --> 03:52:46.720
Don't wait I'll just piss here again

03:52:49.200 --> 03:52:51.200
Thanks husband

03:52:56.000 --> 03:52:59.280
Imagine you're just like an elk and you're just chilling with like hanging out with your herd

03:52:59.280 --> 03:53:03.360
You see these wolves just run by and fucking piss everywhere then run away

03:53:05.280 --> 03:53:13.120
I'm not going after them. I'm just trying to get to the hexagon. Please. Let me get to the right hexagon

03:53:16.480 --> 03:53:18.480
Perfect

03:53:24.960 --> 03:53:28.560
Cool, I'm not gonna bother with that one up top

03:53:30.800 --> 03:53:32.800
Let's see

03:53:33.600 --> 03:53:35.600
Although would be well

03:53:36.080 --> 03:53:37.840
It's fine

03:53:37.840 --> 03:53:42.480
Let's go down here. Although if I do do one of the dens at the bottom

03:53:42.560 --> 03:53:45.760
I can literally probably just take out that entire corner for myself

03:53:46.320 --> 03:53:48.960
But that would take so much fucking time. I'm not I'm not feeling that

03:53:50.160 --> 03:53:54.800
Had I known the dens are all in this bottom part. I would have done that but they don't tell you that

03:53:56.240 --> 03:54:02.320
Let's see. I want to find more dense. Okay. There's some over here. Well, well because they're far away

03:54:03.760 --> 03:54:05.760
They're probably just showing up as a marker

03:54:12.880 --> 03:54:14.880
Tell me there's no dens nearby

03:54:24.320 --> 03:54:27.760
Tell me there's no dens around here in the center, which would be perfect for me

03:54:29.360 --> 03:54:31.360
You fucking bitch

03:54:33.760 --> 03:54:35.760
I

03:54:38.880 --> 03:54:43.440
I'm bringing sexy pack. Did you just killed me? Sorry. What is

03:54:45.120 --> 03:54:47.120
Oh, what the hell? I'm sorry

03:54:47.840 --> 03:54:52.400
One two three four. Okay. I thought they were showing five for some reason

03:54:58.560 --> 03:55:00.560
Is there another one no

03:55:02.800 --> 03:55:04.800
Wow

03:55:08.800 --> 03:55:10.800
I'm bringing sexy pack

03:55:12.480 --> 03:55:14.480
Sorry, I'm just so proud of myself for that

03:55:20.800 --> 03:55:23.840
Okay, it looks like I'll be have to be four. Oh dens nearby dens nearby

03:55:25.600 --> 03:55:27.360
Where

03:55:27.360 --> 03:55:30.800
Oh, we want to fucking sorry. You're in the middle of howling. Let's howl together

03:55:31.760 --> 03:55:39.760
Is there pvp in this game? I don't know. I don't remember if you could ever like try to kill other wolves

03:55:47.280 --> 03:55:49.520
This is dead nearby but like where

03:55:52.000 --> 03:55:54.000
It's not changing color

03:55:55.040 --> 03:55:57.040
Oh sit down this way

03:55:57.280 --> 03:56:01.280
Oh seems like it

03:56:13.760 --> 03:56:20.320
I don't see anything saying it's around here facing the south

03:56:27.760 --> 03:56:29.760
I

03:56:32.800 --> 03:56:34.800
Wanted one in the middle

03:56:39.280 --> 03:56:43.600
There's not a lot of cover, but maybe that would make it easier to keep track of the puppies

03:56:45.200 --> 03:56:47.200
Try to think of what's best for my children. Okay

03:56:49.040 --> 03:56:52.480
Oh, we're close we're close. We're fucking close. Is that it?

03:56:53.440 --> 03:56:55.440
Is rocket

03:56:57.280 --> 03:56:59.280
Please let this big-ass rock be it

03:57:01.520 --> 03:57:04.640
Yeah, yeah, uh, no

03:57:10.400 --> 03:57:12.400
That's what the fuck bro

03:57:16.560 --> 03:57:19.760
Saying it's like right over here. I don't fucking see anything

03:57:22.480 --> 03:57:24.480
Oh

03:57:28.800 --> 03:57:30.800
My god, I'm literally losing it

03:57:41.520 --> 03:57:44.000
I bet it's next to a fucking tree that I just can't see

03:57:44.000 --> 03:57:46.000
Is

03:57:51.520 --> 03:57:58.320
This is this fucking tree it I don't fucking know is that it what is this

03:58:02.560 --> 03:58:04.560
This is a wooded den the trees

03:58:04.640 --> 03:58:09.200
How is more ground cover than open dens giving potatoes like cougars and faces to hide the attacker pups from

03:58:11.040 --> 03:58:13.040
What do you mean what wooded cover

03:58:14.080 --> 03:58:16.080
How

03:58:19.520 --> 03:58:22.000
There's no wooded cover. What are you fucking talking about?

03:58:25.040 --> 03:58:27.040
I can oh

03:58:29.120 --> 03:58:33.040
What the hell are we gonna live in a dirt pile

03:58:35.200 --> 03:58:38.320
Whoa, what the fuck

03:58:41.680 --> 03:58:43.680
I don't want this den

03:58:44.080 --> 03:58:46.080
I don't want this den

03:58:48.080 --> 03:58:50.580
I don't want that 10 10 is ugly

03:58:55.920 --> 03:58:57.920
No, I don't want it

03:58:58.560 --> 03:59:03.600
How do I kind of cancel I don't want this fucking dirt pile to be my house

03:59:04.400 --> 03:59:06.400
I don't want the fucking dirt

03:59:07.360 --> 03:59:09.200
Cuck dirt

03:59:09.200 --> 03:59:11.200
Oh, I'll name it cuck dirt

03:59:11.200 --> 03:59:13.200
I

03:59:13.440 --> 03:59:15.440
Won't let me get out of this

03:59:17.600 --> 03:59:20.720
Okay, I love the game last out of safe

03:59:23.360 --> 03:59:27.680
Oh, oh, look at the little baby little fucking cougar bocats whatever they are

03:59:27.680 --> 03:59:41.600
Okay, I don't want that to be my den I think um

03:59:48.320 --> 03:59:54.400
I think I'm gonna look for the I like aesthetics I go to the nearest one

03:59:58.240 --> 04:00:00.240
I

04:00:01.920 --> 04:00:04.560
Let them one down here

04:00:11.760 --> 04:00:14.160
Those coyotes are loud and annoying

04:00:16.880 --> 04:00:18.880
I liked that tree one

04:00:20.720 --> 04:00:25.600
Or the one in the rock was pretty good, but it'll be open for birds

04:00:26.320 --> 04:00:31.440
I I don't think that was a factor the last time I played this game. You had to like worry about things

04:00:32.960 --> 04:00:34.960
Now I have to find

04:00:34.960 --> 04:00:36.960
Rettucar property. Wait, did they?

04:00:37.600 --> 04:00:39.600
Oh, they did

04:00:40.640 --> 04:00:43.680
Oh, it's whatever it's fine. It's not a priority right now. It's not a priority

04:00:44.960 --> 04:00:47.200
What the fuck oh, let's go to the piss right here

04:00:49.360 --> 04:00:51.360
Act so strong

04:00:51.680 --> 04:00:53.680
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna mark it anyways

04:00:55.680 --> 04:00:58.880
Okay, so there's a den right here. Am I fucking tripping?

04:01:00.560 --> 04:01:03.120
Was this one also the one that was in the ground?

04:01:05.120 --> 04:01:07.120
What

04:01:07.920 --> 04:01:09.920
Oh

04:01:10.000 --> 04:01:12.000
This is nice

04:01:15.120 --> 04:01:17.120
So that would be a good one

04:01:18.000 --> 04:01:20.720
To open den with little no tree and ground cover

04:01:21.680 --> 04:01:23.680
What

04:01:24.400 --> 04:01:28.960
Why isn't let me know tree and ground cover. It's right near some trees that one's good. That's a good choice

04:01:29.760 --> 04:01:31.760
I don't really believe oh

04:01:32.320 --> 04:01:35.520
Maybe there's more trees that are gonna appear because the other one didn't have trees

04:01:48.560 --> 04:01:52.320
How's the rent and amenities exactly those are important things to consider

04:01:53.680 --> 04:01:55.680
I

04:01:57.280 --> 04:01:59.280
It's gonna pass

04:02:05.440 --> 04:02:09.440
I wish I would like have an icon above showing where they actually were

04:02:13.120 --> 04:02:15.120
Is it over here?

04:02:16.880 --> 04:02:22.960
This one. Yes, it was over here. It was over here. I bet this one's also gonna mention like ground cover shit

04:02:23.680 --> 04:02:25.680
What a den

04:02:29.760 --> 04:02:31.760
It doesn't have any ground cover

04:02:34.080 --> 04:02:39.760
I like this one because it's like it's a cute little place for the pups to play and it's a great view

04:02:39.920 --> 04:02:41.920
You can see the sunrise in the morning

04:02:42.480 --> 04:02:44.480
You know, I'll howl with you baby boob

04:02:45.600 --> 04:02:48.480
There's a washer giant unit. I know that's very important

04:02:49.280 --> 04:02:52.560
Um, so that means the other one's all the way over there

04:02:53.840 --> 04:02:55.840
I

04:02:56.160 --> 04:02:58.160
Okay, let's

04:03:03.920 --> 04:03:05.920
Okay, I have to run

04:03:08.080 --> 04:03:10.080
I'm tired

04:03:11.600 --> 04:03:14.100
I'm probably gonna fucking pass out from exhaustion

04:03:23.760 --> 04:03:26.960
I just want to go to those last one just to see what the coverage is

04:03:27.760 --> 04:03:29.760
Should I deal with a cougar than an eagle?

04:03:30.480 --> 04:03:31.760
I don't know

04:03:31.760 --> 04:03:34.960
Because I feel like like with an eagle I could just like scare it off

04:03:47.840 --> 04:03:50.560
Um, whereas with the cougar I'd probably have to fucking fight it off

04:03:54.640 --> 04:04:01.040
I like this one because it's by the water, you know, very beautiful lake side. I mean riverside

04:04:06.000 --> 04:04:08.000
I bet it's gonna say that's open

04:04:11.040 --> 04:04:13.440
Where is it? Where is it?

04:04:18.880 --> 04:04:20.880
I don't want to go so fast

04:04:24.560 --> 04:04:26.560
What the fuck is it?

04:04:28.560 --> 04:04:30.560
Am I tripping?

04:04:31.440 --> 04:04:33.440
I'm like right on top of it, but I don't see it

04:04:36.800 --> 04:04:38.800
Out here it is

04:04:40.000 --> 04:04:42.000
See this is a fancy fucking looking den

04:04:44.800 --> 04:04:46.800
What it done

04:04:46.800 --> 04:04:51.280
More ground cover. You know what? I'm going with this one because it's cool

04:04:54.080 --> 04:04:58.560
You can go pick up your pumpkin dip. That's true

04:05:00.720 --> 04:05:03.200
Um, what should we call it?

04:05:05.360 --> 04:05:11.920
Snaggle rock, although it's a not that what should we call it? This is a cool ass den

04:05:17.920 --> 04:05:19.920
This music is nice

04:05:24.480 --> 04:05:32.560
Epic not done. No! Nottingham den? There's gonna be children living here. Cool ass den. That's a pretty cool

04:05:33.520 --> 04:05:37.200
But would it be like den den? Like would it add another den at the end?

04:05:41.440 --> 04:05:43.440
Cool ass den

04:05:49.600 --> 04:05:52.720
I can't believe I birthed like that earlier. I'm still it's terrifying me

04:05:53.680 --> 04:05:55.680
I

04:05:57.200 --> 04:05:59.200
Tying the knot I like pup max

04:06:01.760 --> 04:06:03.760
Pup pump max

04:06:06.800 --> 04:06:08.800
The pup maxing den

04:06:10.160 --> 04:06:13.920
Oh, they'll be arriving soon. We're gonna have babies

04:06:15.680 --> 04:06:17.680
It's my birthday. Wow

04:06:17.760 --> 04:06:21.760
Uh, age perks review the available age perks for your next year of life decide if you want to advance in age

04:06:21.760 --> 04:06:23.760
If so select three perks in advance

04:06:24.240 --> 04:06:28.640
Note that only one new years of age works active at the time. They don't come in at your lifetime. Okay

04:06:29.520 --> 04:06:35.120
Probably never been to your birthday too means you've survived another year as a wild wolf. I'm three years old about to have babies

04:06:35.360 --> 04:06:41.120
That's not bad. Sometimes good. Sometimes not review your choices and decide if you want to stay advanced or stay as I am

04:06:41.280 --> 04:06:43.520
So I can just stay as my age. How does that work?

04:06:43.520 --> 04:06:45.520
So

04:06:52.160 --> 04:06:54.160
I can get more stamina

04:06:55.680 --> 04:06:59.760
Be more damage or in tracking paying competitors. I can be a fun parent

04:07:01.520 --> 04:07:03.520
Pups never get tired of socializing

04:07:05.120 --> 04:07:10.480
More likely to have a large litter of pups sick pups are more likely to the competitor. What the fuck? I want that

04:07:10.480 --> 04:07:15.680
It's called clout. I want some clout. I want out. I want clout

04:07:16.960 --> 04:07:18.960
So I can pick three

04:07:20.640 --> 04:07:23.120
I don't really care about that. Um, I'll do these

04:07:25.040 --> 04:07:27.040
What can I

04:07:27.280 --> 04:07:29.280
Stay my age

04:07:30.240 --> 04:07:32.240
I gotta advance age three

04:07:32.640 --> 04:07:36.640
Advance vigil these new perks for the coming year. You cannot go back to your younger self. Yeah, that's fine

04:07:37.600 --> 04:07:39.600
Oh

04:07:42.640 --> 04:07:44.640
After nine weeks of gestation

04:07:45.360 --> 04:07:48.800
They look just like me. If your pups are born and dead blind and deaf

04:07:48.800 --> 04:07:52.960
They weigh one pound each your pups may remain in the den for several weeks eating sleeping pepper. We do it out

04:07:54.080 --> 04:07:58.880
Three weeks. They first emerged in the den in the sunlight. They're dark brown now a few weeks of puppy coats will end up

04:07:58.880 --> 04:08:04.800
Oh, okay. Why should we name though? I have babies. Look how cute my babies are

04:08:05.760 --> 04:08:07.920
Blimey stop trying to chew my fucking headphones

04:08:09.440 --> 04:08:11.360
You're ruining the moment

04:08:11.360 --> 04:08:15.120
Wait, I could just name them after my hold on. I'm naming them after my cats

04:08:18.320 --> 04:08:20.320
Oh my god, there's really two girls and a boy

04:08:22.000 --> 04:08:24.000
Bro

04:08:25.760 --> 04:08:27.760
I'm gonna cry

04:08:28.480 --> 04:08:30.480
Oh

04:08:32.240 --> 04:08:34.240
Shapa shabu shabu shubu

04:08:34.800 --> 04:08:40.400
It's literally two girls and a boy. Oh, it's boomy rain and fia. Oh wait, but if my pets die

04:08:40.480 --> 04:08:46.800
I'm gonna be very upset if if I have to keep these puppies alive at all fucking costs guys

04:08:49.280 --> 04:08:56.320
We're going to do it I can tell them to come with me to come here go home. Oh, okay

04:08:58.720 --> 04:09:04.000
Now four weeks old your pups are too big for the den as they spend their days playing outdoors socializing them playful emotes

04:09:04.640 --> 04:09:08.720
Get my pack if they're playful if they're hungry feed them straight for them go find them and carry them back

04:09:09.280 --> 04:09:11.840
Pups mostly eat me regurgitated by you and your mate

04:09:13.120 --> 04:09:14.960
What I'm about to

04:09:14.960 --> 04:09:18.000
Baby bird this shit into your mouth. You must protect them from predators

04:09:18.000 --> 04:09:21.920
You may see a wolf pup is an easy target keeping your pups until they weigh 15 pounds

04:09:23.600 --> 04:09:25.600
Cool

04:09:25.600 --> 04:09:27.600
Especially as they're both your pups

04:09:27.760 --> 04:09:30.080
Go find food eat it and then regurgitate it

04:09:31.440 --> 04:09:35.920
And you go hunting wolf to tell your pups to stay in the den usually stay there like on but affinity is low

04:09:35.920 --> 04:09:38.240
Like to come out before you're turned. Oh, okay

04:09:40.240 --> 04:09:43.600
Oh god, and I still have to maintain the fucking hiss the thing

04:09:44.640 --> 04:09:48.080
Your fee is oh, oh my god, little fia

04:09:51.440 --> 04:09:53.440
Hi fia

04:09:54.320 --> 04:09:57.440
Oh my god, it's my baby

04:10:02.240 --> 04:10:04.960
Sorry, I didn't mean to bump you. Oh my god, look at reina

04:10:06.960 --> 04:10:12.320
Hi guys, what's up? How's it going? Where's boomie?

04:10:14.960 --> 04:10:17.520

04:10:17.520 --> 04:10:19.520
Oh

04:10:21.520 --> 04:10:24.640
Boomie the big boy. He's darker. What the hell?

04:10:27.360 --> 04:10:28.640
Oh

04:10:28.640 --> 04:10:30.640
Oh my god, and reina has blue eyes

04:10:31.200 --> 04:10:33.200
Wait, do they all blue eyes?

04:10:33.440 --> 04:10:36.400
I forget if wolf puppies have blue eyes when they're born. Oh, there he is

04:10:39.360 --> 04:10:43.600
Oh my god, boomie. You're so cute. Oh, can I can I play with you?

04:10:43.920 --> 04:10:50.560
Oh, I just regurgitated for you. Well enjoy. Would you guys like some food?

04:10:55.120 --> 04:10:57.120

04:11:00.400 --> 04:11:04.400
Guys make sure you eat eat my eat my puke, please

04:11:06.320 --> 04:11:08.320
Um, how do I

Try this do you like playful?

04:11:13.760 --> 04:11:15.760
I am stuck walking on my child

04:11:18.320 --> 04:11:20.320
Use emotes, that's what I'm trying to do

04:11:22.880 --> 04:11:24.880
Pop cam, okay

04:11:25.760 --> 04:11:30.000
Got the got the pop cam. Oh, but pop maxing done

04:11:34.240 --> 04:11:39.520
Does that do anything for them? Is that am I socializing?

04:11:39.520 --> 04:11:41.520
Oh

04:11:47.200 --> 04:11:51.600
We're having a great time. Look at my babies. Where did my husband go?

04:11:54.640 --> 04:11:58.320
Did he go did he go get food or

04:12:01.120 --> 04:12:03.120
All right

04:12:03.680 --> 04:12:06.800
Wait, can I go in the den because you couldn't do that before

04:12:07.760 --> 04:12:09.760
Can you go in there?

04:12:15.920 --> 04:12:17.920
What the fuck I can just hang out in here

04:12:22.640 --> 04:12:28.720
I didn't can I go out please my pops still here. I'm like, I hope nothing comes and tries to fucking attack them

04:12:30.960 --> 04:12:33.680
You know pups are in the way. Yeah. Yeah, okay

04:12:34.320 --> 04:12:35.600
um

04:12:35.600 --> 04:12:38.640
You guys are good. So have you guys go in there?

04:12:39.760 --> 04:12:41.760
I wish there was a puppy one

04:12:42.400 --> 04:12:44.400
voice

04:12:45.680 --> 04:12:48.800
Do I tell the pups to go in

04:12:51.280 --> 04:12:53.280
Go home

04:12:56.000 --> 04:12:58.000
Go in the den

04:13:00.240 --> 04:13:02.240
Get in the freaking den

04:13:05.600 --> 04:13:07.920
Ruff get in there

04:13:09.600 --> 04:13:11.600
Your bats get in there

04:13:12.000 --> 04:13:14.000
Mama needs to go piss everywhere

04:13:14.560 --> 04:13:17.360
Your world looks like a Tibetan sand fox. Oh, yeah, you're right

04:13:20.160 --> 04:13:22.160
Goofy

04:13:26.320 --> 04:13:28.880
Um, I don't know what the circle in the hex means

04:13:31.360 --> 04:13:35.440
Uh, I'm actually pretty good. I guess I could go preemptively

04:13:36.400 --> 04:13:40.480
Do stuff where where'd hubby go? Oh

04:13:41.280 --> 04:13:43.280

04:13:44.400 --> 04:13:46.400
And tell you to stay

04:13:54.320 --> 04:13:56.320
Okay, he doesn't seem that bothered by it so

04:13:58.720 --> 04:14:00.480
Did you

04:14:00.480 --> 04:14:02.640
Did you go throw up over there? Why is there?

04:14:03.600 --> 04:14:07.280
We're gurgitated meat all the way over there. All right. Well

04:14:10.560 --> 04:14:12.880
All right, I gotta go on a piss adventure

04:14:17.680 --> 04:14:21.120
I'm gonna go renew that one all the way over there and pee on the way

04:14:22.160 --> 04:14:25.120
I gotta go make sure that the territory is good. Is he coming with me?

04:14:26.880 --> 04:14:30.480
Okay, he's not good. I just wanted to make sure someone's home with the puppies

04:14:31.040 --> 04:14:35.040
We are the piss adventurers

04:14:38.240 --> 04:14:43.920
Toggle my neat meets name tag, okay, I could see the binautical he is at home

04:14:48.400 --> 04:14:50.400
Pissing time

04:14:54.000 --> 04:14:56.000
My pups will survive

04:14:57.760 --> 04:15:00.160
I'm gonna go steal some territory

04:15:01.280 --> 04:15:03.280
Uh

04:15:05.280 --> 04:15:09.280
I feel like I could actually steal the sum till our side

04:15:10.960 --> 04:15:14.160
In a perfect world, I would have the corner

04:15:15.360 --> 04:15:17.840
But me thinks that will not happen

04:15:18.720 --> 04:15:20.720
Then nearby

04:15:22.000 --> 04:15:24.000
Is the same one as before

04:15:27.040 --> 04:15:29.040
Can I move them to another den

04:15:29.760 --> 04:15:31.760
I feel like it. Can I just like do that?

04:15:35.760 --> 04:15:41.520
Are these the same dens as before or is this one up here? What the hell? Yeah, it's okay

04:15:47.200 --> 04:15:55.280
It's my tag. Wow. Are you an agamist wolf today? Yeah, I'm just I'm just by myself. I'm hanging out

04:15:59.440 --> 04:16:01.440
You

04:16:05.520 --> 04:16:10.000
What the fuck I thought that was like smoke coming out of the ground for some reason

04:16:13.360 --> 04:16:15.360
This

04:16:17.600 --> 04:16:21.600
It's renewing on the way, you know, you know how we do we just renew

04:16:24.080 --> 04:16:26.080
Going to fuck up the Lamar pack

04:16:29.120 --> 04:16:32.320
I don't even know what I'm supposed to fucking do though because like

04:16:37.520 --> 04:16:41.040
Like how long is it take for them to grow up? Oh shit. Am I the wrong way?

04:16:43.200 --> 04:16:45.200
Oh god, here we go

04:16:47.520 --> 04:16:49.520
Jump

04:16:50.080 --> 04:16:54.720
I don't have a bubble. It's fine. Look at my little tail. Wee. It's propelling me forward

04:16:56.320 --> 04:16:58.320
Let me get the hair

04:16:59.840 --> 04:17:04.880
Oh, oh my god, I'm too fast. I need to back up

04:17:09.280 --> 04:17:11.280
Yes time

04:17:12.800 --> 04:17:16.160
I bet the game would also look a lot different because I'm like, oh, there's no tree cover

04:17:16.160 --> 04:17:18.800
But I bet when it's on max graphics. It actually looks okay

04:17:21.280 --> 04:17:24.640
How's everyone doing chat just wolfing around we're wolfing out tonight

04:17:30.000 --> 04:17:33.840
I know might be boring because I'm playing wolf running simulator, but I'm actually enjoying myself

04:17:35.600 --> 04:17:38.960
I'm so like focused. I'm just like, yeah, this is some good stuff

04:17:41.600 --> 04:17:43.600
Collectible object

04:17:44.160 --> 04:17:46.160
What

04:17:46.800 --> 04:17:48.800
Like it

04:17:49.360 --> 04:17:51.360
I can't pick it up

04:17:53.280 --> 04:17:57.360
Why do I have a fucking oil lamp I don't need this shit

04:17:59.920 --> 04:18:01.920
Leave that there

04:18:05.520 --> 04:18:07.520
What am I gonna do with that

04:18:07.600 --> 04:18:11.280
Making pens cursing the day someone thought it'd be funny to get a nail on a tree

04:18:13.120 --> 04:18:14.800
Oh

04:18:14.800 --> 04:18:18.720
What do you what I don't know what did you do for work? So that would be a thing

04:18:18.720 --> 04:18:20.720
I

04:18:24.400 --> 04:18:26.720
Depth of the game with territories and stuff is nuts. I know

04:18:27.920 --> 04:18:29.920
Yeah, if you fall asleep, that's fine

04:18:30.640 --> 04:18:32.640
It's fall asleep to me happen

04:18:34.000 --> 04:18:36.000
My butt is going numb though

04:18:36.400 --> 04:18:50.320
Cool means that's all walk through I'm gonna snag these hexes on over here by the red Lamar pack

04:18:53.760 --> 04:18:59.360
Okay, it seems like they don't fade as much when you finally make your den

04:19:02.320 --> 04:19:04.320
Like you can kind of

04:19:04.720 --> 04:19:06.720
Keep it cool

04:19:09.280 --> 04:19:13.200
Period, yep, I'm stealing this shit, bro. I'm stealing it

04:19:16.080 --> 04:19:17.760
It's a hobby for what oh

04:19:17.760 --> 04:19:20.640
Yes, I remember I was like watching a bunch of tiktoks of that before

04:19:21.360 --> 04:19:24.720
And I just wanted to learn how to do it. So I went to this local like woodworking shop

04:19:24.720 --> 04:19:27.840
I'm like, hey, you guys do this and they're like no and I'm like, oh, okay

04:19:29.200 --> 04:19:31.680
That's too bad. I'm gonna piss one more time

04:19:32.640 --> 04:19:35.600
Okay, I don't know why I thought I needed to piss again

04:19:38.160 --> 04:19:44.400
I wonder if you two bull demonetizes because I'm just like the ai is this gonna be talking about piss the entire time

04:19:52.480 --> 04:19:54.640
Perfect perfect rock to piss on

04:19:54.640 --> 04:20:05.840
No, I didn't do anything. All right, I guess I just gotta run around in here some more then I'll take it over

04:20:10.400 --> 04:20:14.400
Although what I really should be doing I really should be focusing on the ones in the corner

04:20:14.400 --> 04:20:17.440
So I might go and do that check on the pops and go do the ones in the corner

04:20:18.160 --> 04:20:21.040
Grab some food on the way. You know, you know what I'm saying

04:20:25.360 --> 04:20:35.520
Yeah, I'll just I'm so tempted to snag these two though. They're just like they're just there for the taking

04:20:35.520 --> 04:20:39.120
Look at those fucking rocks. Can I kill this bird? No

04:20:41.680 --> 04:20:43.680
Hope my puppies are okay

04:20:47.120 --> 04:20:49.120
Oh, nope. I'm back in my territory

04:20:55.120 --> 04:20:58.320
There we go

04:21:00.000 --> 04:21:03.600
I'm getting the let's go back. I won't worry about that random

04:21:04.480 --> 04:21:07.040
Although but the purples are gonna probably take it

04:21:08.000 --> 04:21:10.000
It's mine

04:21:12.560 --> 04:21:15.760
Because it's cut off from their territory, so it doesn't even fucking matter

04:21:16.480 --> 04:21:19.840
because it's so they sandwiched in between me and

04:21:20.800 --> 04:21:22.320
Yeah

04:21:22.320 --> 04:21:25.680
We're doing strats get some macaques for the pups

04:21:27.760 --> 04:21:29.760
Get some maracas

04:21:30.400 --> 04:21:32.400
I'm gonna go towards the wolf so

04:21:42.880 --> 04:21:47.760
Where Jesus I have to go all the way this fucking hill it's gonna take me forever to get back up

04:21:53.200 --> 04:22:01.280
Yeah, I know the fucking purple wolves are like give us this shit. We want this area. Oh perfect. Okay

04:22:05.200 --> 04:22:07.200
What the hell

04:22:10.400 --> 04:22:14.960
I'm I'm peeing out of my back. I'm a very talented bunny

04:22:16.480 --> 04:22:20.000
You can do many things. What the fuck this should be like a dense site. Are you kidding me?

04:22:20.960 --> 04:22:22.960
Oh, whoa, I'm gonna pee up here

04:22:24.880 --> 04:22:26.560
This is pretty

04:22:26.560 --> 04:22:30.640
Look at this. You told me this isn't a dense site. It'd be a shitty dense site

04:22:30.720 --> 04:22:34.800
But there's a tree growing on this rock. I almost got stuck in it. That would have been bad

04:22:38.400 --> 04:22:44.400
I am pissing everywhere pissing everywhere. I'm pissing everywhere. No one can stop me

04:22:45.920 --> 04:22:47.920
Pissing out my back

04:22:48.880 --> 04:22:50.880
I'm sliding down this rock

04:22:55.040 --> 04:22:57.760
What says there's a den nearby this is weird

04:23:00.080 --> 04:23:02.080
I don't want to keep going this way

04:23:04.640 --> 04:23:06.640
I'm gonna pee next to this tree

04:23:07.280 --> 04:23:09.920
Lion king odd den it really is though

04:23:10.880 --> 04:23:12.880
Really was a lion king odd den

04:23:13.520 --> 04:23:15.360
I can't climb up there

04:23:15.440 --> 04:23:18.000
I don't know what else I have to fucking do to take over this hex

04:23:30.160 --> 04:23:32.800
There we go finally that took a long time

04:23:36.400 --> 04:23:38.400
Too soon

04:23:38.400 --> 04:23:40.720
Fuck you. All right, let's go check on the babies

04:23:41.440 --> 04:23:44.320
See how the the kittens are doing. I mean the puppies

04:23:46.320 --> 04:23:48.320
Oh, maybe it's just showing me mine

04:23:49.680 --> 04:23:52.180
Yeah, my den is down here. Wee

04:23:53.840 --> 04:23:56.480
I wonder if I follow this river. It'll probably leave me right to it

04:23:58.560 --> 04:24:00.560
What the fuck is happening here?

04:24:02.400 --> 04:24:04.400
Yeah, okay

04:24:05.280 --> 04:24:07.280
I haven't run into any like wildlife

04:24:07.280 --> 04:24:09.280
I

04:24:13.440 --> 04:24:18.080
Wish I could run in pee faster. I accidentally keep moving

04:24:19.680 --> 04:24:21.680
There we go

04:24:22.320 --> 04:24:25.120
Pretty sure if I run down this. Oh, can I drink?

04:24:28.720 --> 04:24:30.720
Yeah, drinking doesn't really do anything

04:24:30.880 --> 04:24:37.200
I don't need to drink water I'm a wolf. What the fuck, okay

04:24:44.000 --> 04:24:50.480
I literally bet if I follow this river it will take me straight back to the thing. No, it won't what the fuck

04:24:54.720 --> 04:24:56.720
Okay, I should probably grab food on the way

04:24:57.520 --> 04:25:02.080
Mom, can you give McDonald's McDonald's a hoe?

04:25:04.000 --> 04:25:06.480
It's just like a kids cuisine

04:25:14.800 --> 04:25:16.800
Everything the piss touches is yours

04:25:16.800 --> 04:25:18.800
I

04:25:21.840 --> 04:25:26.480
Also how oh perfect what's that over there? Hope they didn't hear me

04:25:28.480 --> 04:25:33.920
It's gonna be a bitch to chase them though. I need to chase them in the direction of my stuff

04:25:35.920 --> 04:25:39.680
Slide down this hill with my tail propelling me

04:25:47.760 --> 04:25:49.760
Oh

04:25:51.360 --> 04:25:53.360
No, I'm chasing them in the red territory

04:25:54.240 --> 04:25:58.400
I meant to chase them in a different territory if I circle them to go this way

04:25:59.680 --> 04:26:01.680
Heard them heard them go

04:26:04.160 --> 04:26:06.160
Can I please bite one of you?

04:26:12.000 --> 04:26:13.280
Like

04:26:13.280 --> 04:26:16.560
It's annoying because it locks me on one and I'm like I try to unlock

04:26:20.080 --> 04:26:22.080
I'll just piss one at it

04:26:26.800 --> 04:26:28.800
Let's see

04:26:28.800 --> 04:26:32.240
Perfect like run them into my story. I'm trying to direct them

04:26:33.440 --> 04:26:35.440
towards the

04:26:35.520 --> 04:26:37.520
Den

04:26:43.600 --> 04:26:46.240
I can like kind of drive them closer

04:26:50.960 --> 04:26:58.960
All right, I'm pressing a different button as if I'm locking on just like in elden ring or lice p

04:27:06.560 --> 04:27:09.040
See all right, I'm supposed to in the middle. That's fine

04:27:13.280 --> 04:27:15.280
I

04:27:32.240 --> 04:27:38.000
Run no, I'm going the wrong direction now. Oh, whatever

04:27:43.920 --> 04:27:45.920
I

04:27:51.360 --> 04:27:56.080
Wolf souls man, that'd be so fucking sick if you could just be a wolf with a sword walking around

04:28:00.480 --> 04:28:02.480
Sorry, I'm cutting my little howl off

04:28:06.720 --> 04:28:08.960
Gumi what are you doing you play with your toy?

04:28:13.440 --> 04:28:15.440
I

04:28:20.880 --> 04:28:23.840
What's up boomi, I don't know if you guys can hear him. He's like

04:28:27.760 --> 04:28:29.760
I'm peeing out of the wrong leg, but it's fine

04:28:31.440 --> 04:28:33.440
Play

04:28:34.240 --> 04:28:36.240
That's a good point

04:28:37.200 --> 04:28:39.200
Oh

04:28:43.040 --> 04:28:46.640
Is that a hair I couldn't see it. It's probably hair

04:28:46.640 --> 04:28:48.640
I

04:29:03.680 --> 04:29:05.680
Think a little bites easier

04:29:07.120 --> 04:29:09.360
Should play a for what is that about like apes?

04:29:11.360 --> 04:29:13.360
Let me guess it's about apes

04:29:17.200 --> 04:29:20.720
Play the human not good with material especially if you know his purpose

04:29:24.800 --> 04:29:29.920
I kind of like I I like I like reading a lot of the lore for elden ring and

04:29:30.720 --> 04:29:32.000
to be honest

04:29:32.000 --> 04:29:34.000
Blades path was one of the most

04:29:34.000 --> 04:29:39.120
Or blithe I keep pronouncing his name not the correct way. Blithe's path was the most interesting to me

04:29:39.680 --> 04:29:41.680
Just like struggle

04:29:42.320 --> 04:29:43.520
I wish I followed it

04:29:43.520 --> 04:29:47.680
But I was because I like I initially went was going for the Ronnie ending, but then I

04:29:48.320 --> 04:29:50.720
Didn't stick with it. Do I have any like food around here?

04:29:52.960 --> 04:29:55.280
It's bison I can't take down a fucking bison

04:30:02.160 --> 04:30:04.640
Well came back empty-handed

04:30:06.320 --> 04:30:09.440
I did have a bite, but I also need to sleep

04:30:10.400 --> 04:30:12.400
So we're going back to the den

04:30:20.880 --> 04:30:23.680
Kind of tragic doesn't want to lose me the way it was. Yeah

04:30:25.920 --> 04:30:27.920
Den nearby is it my own?

04:30:29.760 --> 04:30:31.760
Is it my own den that's nearby?

04:30:40.400 --> 04:30:42.400
Oh

04:30:46.400 --> 04:30:48.400
Wait

04:30:50.320 --> 04:30:52.320
I didn't see them there

04:30:52.480 --> 04:30:54.480
I

04:31:20.080 --> 04:31:22.080
Like how they hop

04:31:22.640 --> 04:31:24.640
Come on

04:31:30.560 --> 04:31:32.560
I'm so close to your ass

04:31:35.680 --> 04:31:42.960
I must ran into a tree I got tired some exhausted. All right. Let's just head back

04:31:42.960 --> 04:31:52.560
Where's my family?

04:32:05.840 --> 04:32:11.040
Oh perfect, I'm happy I can see them because that makes it a lot easier for me

04:32:13.920 --> 04:32:17.600
She's sick to part two two for the wool quest stream. I don't know

04:32:18.800 --> 04:32:22.000
Maybe I don't know if you guys like women watch you play this

04:32:23.200 --> 04:32:25.200
I'm so tired. I can't run

04:32:27.600 --> 04:32:31.600
Hi, is it time to sleep? Oh fia. What are you doing out here?

04:32:31.920 --> 04:32:35.760
This is definitely a fia thing to do. Although it is also a boomy thing to do

04:32:35.760 --> 04:32:37.760
I'm gonna pee right next to the den

04:32:37.760 --> 04:32:39.760
I

04:32:41.280 --> 04:32:43.280
What are you doing lady

04:32:45.600 --> 04:32:48.000
She's just hanging out because

04:32:51.360 --> 04:32:57.200
Okay, like I don't know how to like play with them. Do I just like play about

04:32:59.360 --> 04:33:03.920
Are she acting like she's dead? Is that how she sleeps? It's funny because that's how fia sleeps though

04:33:08.240 --> 04:33:10.240
No food

04:33:13.600 --> 04:33:22.400
Ma'am, can you wake up? I didn't mean to throw up but okay. I'm trying to pick her up

04:33:26.400 --> 04:33:28.400
Can I go in there? No

04:33:29.360 --> 04:33:40.400
What are you doing lady get in there it's time to sleep get on in there bud

04:33:44.160 --> 04:33:49.040
Can I go in there too please oh look we're all hanging

04:33:54.000 --> 04:33:56.640
Why am I dreaming of a fucking fire Jesus

04:33:59.360 --> 04:34:04.080
I would watch you paint dry. I would watch you watch paint dry

04:34:06.080 --> 04:34:09.120
If you don't watch she's serving so it came from your sir

04:34:10.800 --> 04:34:13.440
Why do I only have one pup in here? Where are my other puppies?

04:34:15.840 --> 04:34:17.840
Oh, it's pretty outside

04:34:19.600 --> 04:34:21.600
Cowell

04:34:23.120 --> 04:34:25.120
Oh my god the babies

04:34:29.120 --> 04:34:35.520
All right seems like we're good looks like everybody's kind of just like filled their hexes

04:34:36.960 --> 04:34:38.960
I think it's time we expand to the corner

04:34:42.400 --> 04:34:44.400
I'm gonna sleep one more time

04:34:49.360 --> 04:34:52.400
It's my exhaustion is up what the fuck is this puppy doing over here?

04:34:58.400 --> 04:35:00.400

04:35:06.640 --> 04:35:11.680
Raina has fallen ill spending time with them are pooser odds. What the fuck

04:35:14.880 --> 04:35:16.880
Why are you ill?

04:35:19.120 --> 04:35:21.120
I gotta eat more before I can regurgitate

04:35:23.040 --> 04:35:25.600
No, no you don't get to wait. How do I

04:35:28.400 --> 04:35:35.600
Okay, fiat get over here. I'm here. I don't want to regurgitate. I'm trying to pick you up

04:35:41.520 --> 04:35:43.520
What what are these puppies doing

04:35:48.320 --> 04:35:50.320

And she'll roll over into her belly and she lets me pet her belly. This is adorable. I'm having the best time of my life right now

I

04:43:33.440 --> 04:43:36.000
Need to find smells

04:43:42.720 --> 04:43:44.960
The binautical mule deer

04:43:51.920 --> 04:43:55.120
All right, we're going up I want to go down

04:43:59.200 --> 04:44:08.480
A lot of stuff is coming up from here anyways. Oh, are they just here? No two hours ago

04:44:08.480 --> 04:44:10.480
Oh

04:44:24.880 --> 04:44:28.160
Oh my god, I'm still going. How do I just like randomly go the wrong way?

04:44:30.560 --> 04:44:32.560
I don't understand it

04:44:33.040 --> 04:44:40.960
Okay, let's take this shit over boy. There it is

04:44:47.920 --> 04:44:50.480
I'm gonna get some food on the way. How perfect is that?

04:45:02.720 --> 04:45:07.920
Yeah, I'm gonna try to run into the rock. I need a pause. Yeah, because it's right here

04:45:22.800 --> 04:45:24.480
Not doing anything

04:45:24.480 --> 04:45:27.280
Street lights are on get a little ass to the tent

04:45:28.320 --> 04:45:30.320
I think you came to see this for the super

04:45:32.880 --> 04:45:36.560
I'm sorry. It's a fucking piss here

04:45:41.120 --> 04:45:44.800
All right, well still got to find food because hungry as fuck

04:45:48.160 --> 04:45:50.160
Over there, okay

04:45:56.320 --> 04:45:58.320
See we can cut them off

04:46:02.640 --> 04:46:04.640
Oh

04:46:08.800 --> 04:46:10.800
Where they go

04:46:14.320 --> 04:46:20.240
No, that's hair where the fuck did I but I accidentally run them off for my stupid

04:46:22.480 --> 04:46:25.120
Well, it's like coyote. I really don't care about that

04:46:27.040 --> 04:46:29.040
Well, the fuck that those deer just go

04:46:30.000 --> 04:46:34.640
Did I lose them amongst the tree trunks? Because I am apt to do that

04:46:42.160 --> 04:46:44.160
Oh

04:46:50.320 --> 04:46:52.320
What the heck? The scent just disappeared

04:46:52.800 --> 04:46:54.800
Oh

04:46:57.680 --> 04:47:02.480
The hell where the fuck it was just said 15 minutes ago, then it fucking disappeared. Are you serious?

04:47:05.440 --> 04:47:07.440
Bruh

04:47:08.640 --> 04:47:10.640
I'm getting tired of hunting for food

04:47:11.600 --> 04:47:16.000
25 minutes ago am I going the opposite direction? Nope. Yep. It looks like they meant to go this way

04:47:17.440 --> 04:47:19.440
I didn't get super smell where you could do that

04:47:23.120 --> 04:47:30.080
Okay, so they were right over here

04:47:36.560 --> 04:47:38.960
Yeah, we're gonna hunt another pack fucking territory

04:47:40.560 --> 04:47:42.560
The fuck

04:47:44.240 --> 04:47:47.200
I'm losing the dough to the pronghorn

04:47:47.920 --> 04:47:52.480
Oh my god, please. I'm just I just want to eat

04:47:55.600 --> 04:47:57.600
Oh perfect

04:48:00.800 --> 04:48:02.800
No, get the one closer

04:48:08.640 --> 04:48:10.640
Come on

04:48:18.080 --> 04:48:22.160
Bring her down bring her down super smell also includes bad smells. That's a good point

04:48:24.560 --> 04:48:29.200
But like I always wondered like why a dog doesn't recognize like bad smells or like

04:48:30.160 --> 04:48:35.600
Because like cats will react to bad smells, but I've never seen like dogs really react to bad smells. I don't know

04:48:36.320 --> 04:48:38.320
Actually, no, they probably like huff

04:48:47.520 --> 04:48:53.680
Like I'll just sink it to the ground. Okay. Oh, I think we're good

04:49:05.440 --> 04:49:07.440
I want that fucking thing though

04:49:17.920 --> 04:49:19.920
I

04:49:28.240 --> 04:49:33.600
Want to change I feel like we have to like run across it

04:49:40.000 --> 04:49:42.960
I'm really pissed in this area so many fucking times

04:49:48.000 --> 04:49:50.000
Finally

04:49:51.520 --> 04:49:53.520
It's way too long

04:50:04.400 --> 04:50:08.240
And if we get any food on the way then we'll grab some

04:50:09.040 --> 04:50:11.040
Um

04:50:14.000 --> 04:50:20.080
My commentary is leaving me I'm like losing the yappage because I'm just so focused and enjoying myself

04:50:30.960 --> 04:50:34.480
Everything is different smells that are bad bad usually means danger to animals. That's a good point

04:50:38.400 --> 04:50:40.400
I

04:50:45.920 --> 04:50:48.240
Live in my work wolf girl dreams right now

04:50:50.320 --> 04:50:55.280
Wait name tags are on I wonder where the where are the baby so I can't I say them

04:50:58.160 --> 04:51:00.800
As long as we're having a good time she be she's immersed because

04:51:02.800 --> 04:51:04.560
I remember

04:51:04.560 --> 04:51:05.920
on time

04:51:05.920 --> 04:51:07.920
I was talking to

04:51:08.240 --> 04:51:13.120
My dad was like, how do you want your steak and I said like rare because I like rare steak or like medium

04:51:13.920 --> 04:51:15.920
um

04:51:16.400 --> 04:51:18.400
And

04:51:19.200 --> 04:51:23.840
It was like a lot pinker like he accidentally didn't let he like not like undercooked it

04:51:23.920 --> 04:51:28.320
But just like it was rarer than I thought it was going to be or the fuck is it in

04:51:30.800 --> 04:51:33.920
Where's that dad bro

04:51:33.920 --> 04:51:37.600
I just want to get to my puppies

04:51:43.920 --> 04:51:45.920
Can't am I blind?

04:51:54.320 --> 04:51:56.320
Is it up here?

04:51:59.280 --> 04:52:01.280
Oh my god, um

04:52:01.680 --> 04:52:09.280
And it like was really pink and oh they came out. Oh look at them. Oh you hungry eat some food

04:52:10.560 --> 04:52:12.560
I didn't mean to pick you up

04:52:13.520 --> 04:52:15.520
Oh my god

04:52:20.320 --> 04:52:21.520
Enjoy

04:52:21.520 --> 04:52:27.200
And it was I can't get it even I'm so focused on the game and sleepy that I didn't even really might even telling the story

04:52:27.760 --> 04:52:31.440
And it was a little bit red that was like bloody and I was just like

04:52:33.360 --> 04:52:35.360
Oh rena sharing

04:52:36.080 --> 04:52:38.080
Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to pick you up

04:52:39.040 --> 04:52:41.040
Come on

04:52:45.120 --> 04:52:47.680
And I'm like I gotta do this one thing

04:52:49.440 --> 04:52:50.560
And um

04:52:50.560 --> 04:52:56.080
My dad's like, oh you should be fine because I was just like I think it's too bloody like it looks like there's a blood clot in it

04:52:56.080 --> 04:53:00.400
He's like it doesn't matter, you know, because you're a wolf and I'm like what he's like

04:53:00.480 --> 04:53:04.320
Yeah, because like don't you like being a wolf and stuff. I'm like dad

04:53:09.040 --> 04:53:13.840
If Adam is happy being a wolf that ought to be and it's funny because when my parents like when I first started

04:53:13.840 --> 04:53:18.800
To V2 my parents are like, why didn't you pick a wolf? I'm like because everybody's a fucking wolf and then I picked a cat

04:53:19.600 --> 04:53:23.200
And then everybody's a fucking cat. So I don't know what the fuck I was talking about and now I'm a bunny

04:53:23.200 --> 04:53:25.200
And now everybody's a bunny

04:53:26.640 --> 04:53:28.640
Oh

04:53:30.160 --> 04:53:33.600
I'm like 2.0. Should I just like change my animal 3.0

04:53:37.040 --> 04:53:39.040
Dad knows what it up

04:53:39.920 --> 04:53:41.920
Feels a little weird, man

04:53:42.720 --> 04:53:44.720
All right

04:53:49.280 --> 04:53:53.360
Oh my god, hi boomie. Oh my god, the real life boomie. It's him

04:53:54.320 --> 04:53:56.320
Hi, Sean

04:53:58.560 --> 04:54:01.280
Can you get in the bed if you're gonna hang out up here?

04:54:05.200 --> 04:54:09.280
3.0, she's an alligator. I was like debating whether or not to be like a reptile

04:54:10.160 --> 04:54:12.160
Does that mean they're full? I don't really

04:54:15.760 --> 04:54:20.160
It's really funny because they're very close to their actual colors. The boomie is not a black cat. So that's

04:54:20.880 --> 04:54:25.760
Speaking of boomie, where the fuck did he go? Oh, he's with he's with uh his dad

04:54:29.280 --> 04:54:31.280
Boomi is chewing on the box that

04:54:33.120 --> 04:54:35.120
Who came in?

04:54:37.680 --> 04:54:43.520
All right, well I'm gonna pass the fuck out later. Don't get eaten by something, please

04:54:43.520 --> 04:54:45.520
I

04:54:48.880 --> 04:54:50.880
Like we should I should have made them sleep in the den

04:54:53.120 --> 04:54:55.600
Wake up wake up

04:54:59.200 --> 04:55:02.000
Where's boomie where's boomie

04:55:04.640 --> 04:55:06.640
Where's boomie?

04:55:08.880 --> 04:55:12.320
Okay, Jesus you scared me son

04:55:13.840 --> 04:55:19.920
Would you like some food?

04:55:23.360 --> 04:55:25.360
Enjoy kiddos

04:55:29.280 --> 04:55:32.960
By by nautical you're not really regurgitating enough in my opinion

04:55:32.960 --> 04:55:38.400
No, are you wagging his tail at them?

04:55:38.400 --> 04:55:44.400
Boomi's the wild child. Boomi is the wild child. He's the wild child and then he's he's always smacking feet in the face right now

04:55:45.120 --> 04:55:49.680
Which is funny because they're fighting in the game or they're playing in the game and now they're they're playing

04:55:49.680 --> 04:55:54.880
They're literally right next to me and reina's doing reina always does her own thing. She's like, oh, she's like she's a cool cat

04:55:55.600 --> 04:55:58.080
Um, I'm picking up though reina. Well

04:55:58.800 --> 04:56:02.320
Moving too fast come here child

04:56:04.320 --> 04:56:07.360
Why does it sound like something from the princess bride?

04:56:08.320 --> 04:56:10.320
Where are the children? Oh my god

04:56:11.120 --> 04:56:14.480

04:56:35.440 --> 04:56:37.600
Oh my god, this is gonna take fucking forever

04:56:39.280 --> 04:56:41.280
They're only at seven pounds

04:56:43.920 --> 04:56:45.920
How high is the affinity?

04:56:49.120 --> 04:56:51.120

I don't see a fucking grizzly

04:57:49.520 --> 04:57:54.720
What's with the grizzly thing where is said grizzly?

04:58:01.200 --> 04:58:03.200
Where is it

04:58:07.360 --> 04:58:12.720

04:58:15.760 --> 04:58:17.760

You no, you're not killing fucking fear

04:58:30.320 --> 04:58:38.160

Okay

05:00:29.840 --> 05:00:32.160
Sorry, I have to make sure I'm in the right orientation

05:00:33.120 --> 05:00:37.360
I'm not like, oh, I need to go north. I'm like, oh, I must point my arrow in the right way

05:00:38.880 --> 05:00:40.880

Rogue ass wolves be on uncle put in some work there. Honestly props to by nautical. I'm I'm very impressed with him

05:01:06.560 --> 05:01:09.200
I'm not gonna bother to go all the way over there for that. Um

05:01:11.840 --> 05:01:18.320
I'm gonna go down down the river that's not down the river

05:01:23.040 --> 05:01:25.440
To see if I can find some food in the corner

05:01:25.440 --> 05:01:30.640
One of the puppies is like super low

05:01:38.000 --> 05:01:40.000

Not good. She's at 20 life right now. Jesus. Fuck. I didn't mean to go that way

05:01:59.600 --> 05:02:01.600
Why is there like no

05:02:02.720 --> 05:02:09.120
You know, I must I'm not even gonna focus on taking over corners. I might just focus on trying to fucking find food

05:02:13.760 --> 05:02:15.760
That way

05:02:19.120 --> 05:02:21.120
Oh

05:02:32.000 --> 05:02:34.000
Come on

05:02:38.160 --> 05:02:40.160

05:02:40.960 --> 05:02:42.960
I

05:02:47.200 --> 05:02:49.200
Let that not fuck you up

05:02:53.760 --> 05:02:55.760
There we go

05:02:57.600 --> 05:03:02.000
Almost there almost got you come here come here

05:03:04.320 --> 05:03:06.320
You're almost dead

05:03:07.760 --> 05:03:09.760
You're mine

05:03:10.320 --> 05:03:12.320
Oh

05:03:12.400 --> 05:03:14.400
No, I'm out of stamina

05:03:17.120 --> 05:03:19.120
But so are you

05:03:21.520 --> 05:03:26.240
You better oh my god, let's wait till I get my stamina back

05:03:32.800 --> 05:03:34.800
Stop trying to fight back just fucking die

05:03:40.240 --> 05:03:42.320
Actually, I can take a little piece of meat

05:03:45.360 --> 05:03:50.720
I ate that meat chunk because I can probably bring a meat chunk back to what's his face

05:03:55.520 --> 05:03:57.600
Or maybe not I guess I I guess I can't

05:03:59.920 --> 05:04:01.920
I'm eating the deer's ass

05:04:05.840 --> 05:04:07.840
Okay

05:04:10.160 --> 05:04:12.160
I

05:04:15.040 --> 05:04:17.520
Might as well just take this fucking square while I'm at it

05:04:22.240 --> 05:04:26.240
My nautical getting a wind and dying while I was trying to I don't know if it's gonna work out

05:04:27.440 --> 05:04:31.360
At least I killed that like right next to our stuff

05:04:35.440 --> 05:04:39.280
Oh, they might show up that would suck if they did

05:04:40.160 --> 05:04:42.160
So

05:04:43.600 --> 05:04:46.400
Because they are fairly close

05:04:50.560 --> 05:04:52.560
Oh, okay

05:05:00.320 --> 05:05:04.240
Oh my god, you go I need to go take care of rena

05:05:04.240 --> 05:05:11.600
I'm just gonna pee fucking everywhere

05:05:16.000 --> 05:05:18.000
Oh wait

05:05:27.360 --> 05:05:30.800
How am I still not technically in here there we go

05:05:35.120 --> 05:05:38.640
Oh damn it whatever all right

05:05:47.840 --> 05:05:51.440
I think with the dot in the square it means you can never like

05:05:52.960 --> 05:05:56.400
Um, I'll lose that square which is are the hexagon which is nice

05:06:05.200 --> 05:06:11.200
Yeah, it's a lot easier to maintain the hexagons now now that when you actually have a den in place and like a

05:06:11.840 --> 05:06:13.840
Tree you don't have to do as much

05:06:14.880 --> 05:06:18.080
To like maintain it except to run around every once in a while

05:06:25.120 --> 05:06:28.880
Wolf wasn't pissing she's squared on command. Oh my god

05:06:35.200 --> 05:06:40.960
All right, where's again I lose track of where the fucking den is

05:06:47.600 --> 05:06:49.600
Hello

05:06:50.160 --> 05:06:52.160

05:07:47.680 --> 05:07:49.680
He's all the way over there

05:07:51.280 --> 05:07:53.280
Come eat your food kid

05:07:58.720 --> 05:08:01.200
This is so stupid, how did rena even get sick?

05:08:12.720 --> 05:08:14.720

05:08:39.520 --> 05:08:41.520
Oh, he just like woke up

05:08:43.120 --> 05:08:45.120

Reina come out and play

05:08:48.160 --> 05:08:51.200
She's even lower than before. Oh, no

05:08:52.880 --> 05:08:54.880
She's at 13 percent

05:09:02.640 --> 05:09:10.000
No, poor old they don't know if reina's gonna make it. I'm generally gonna cry

05:09:16.080 --> 05:09:22.240
It's gonna be like rena died in the night. She didn't make it. Can I wake up, please?

05:09:32.320 --> 05:09:35.680
Oh, thank god, look at it. That's actually literally how she'll sleep on me though

05:09:37.200 --> 05:09:39.360
And I come out and it's like fia and boomie are dead

05:09:40.320 --> 05:09:42.320
I'll be like what?

05:09:43.280 --> 05:09:46.720
Here you go. I didn't mean to pick you up

05:09:54.480 --> 05:09:56.480
Reina come eat

05:10:01.440 --> 05:10:06.480
No, what I did was nowhere near there, please

05:10:12.880 --> 05:10:14.880
Oh

05:10:15.680 --> 05:10:17.680

05:10:21.440 --> 05:10:23.440
There you go eat that

05:10:26.960 --> 05:10:28.960

You'll fee you want to play you want to you want to you want to sniff

05:10:36.560 --> 05:10:38.560
Can I sniff her?

05:10:39.520 --> 05:10:42.080
Can I can I do that with

05:10:46.800 --> 05:10:48.800
I don't really think it can

05:10:50.080 --> 05:10:52.080
You know how well

05:10:54.640 --> 05:10:56.640
We stay winning

05:11:01.520 --> 05:11:03.920
Wait, I like how it said reina's recovered what she's

05:11:04.720 --> 05:11:09.760
Okay, she's just recovering I suppose booby is a fat dude

05:11:12.080 --> 05:11:17.600
If they need to use a hundred percent we could move to a new den but we're fine really

05:11:24.160 --> 05:11:29.040
What's up for you oh you so cute girly pop

05:11:34.720 --> 05:11:40.720
The binautical is just hanging out I suppose what the hell is reina walking weird

05:11:47.920 --> 05:11:49.920
Okay, let me see

05:11:49.920 --> 05:11:55.360
Okay, let's say they thought they took that square over. Oh my god blue has taken the whole bottom. Holy crap

05:11:57.280 --> 05:11:59.280
Damn blue

05:11:59.440 --> 05:12:01.440
I

05:12:02.960 --> 05:12:04.960
Think I'm gonna go for that

05:12:05.920 --> 05:12:08.720
Um carcass real quick

05:12:11.120 --> 05:12:13.120
So I'm gonna tell them to

05:12:15.520 --> 05:12:17.520

05:12:18.640 --> 05:12:23.920
Get back, okay, he just fucking brought them over like yeah, I could get back in there

05:12:24.400 --> 05:12:26.400
You're back in there

05:12:28.000 --> 05:12:36.160
Go on okay, I'm gonna go to that carcass if it's not taken over by stuff

05:12:39.040 --> 05:12:43.920
Yeah, I don't really need like you know, uh the binautical can kind of just

05:12:46.640 --> 05:12:50.640
Can kind of just like hang out stay home be a little stay at home dad

05:12:54.000 --> 05:13:02.160
I should have brought that to him. I don't think he'll eat stuff that I bring him though unless it's a maybe if it's a meat chunk

05:13:04.080 --> 05:13:06.080
We'll try it

05:13:10.880 --> 05:13:13.680
Can't smell the carcass so I don't even know if it's around anymore

05:13:18.400 --> 05:13:20.400
But there's me a fucking grizzly at it

05:13:24.320 --> 05:13:30.560
I feel like I'm playing like mine survival minecraft except its wolves and it's nothing like this. Oh, it's just a coyote

05:13:36.560 --> 05:13:39.360
Not pee real quick squirtin

05:13:41.520 --> 05:13:48.180
Where's the uh, what the hell? Oh, that's right. I forgot it was in their territory

05:13:54.880 --> 05:14:02.320
I can't wait for the velar minecraft server. Yeah, it would be goofy. I'm not good at minecraft at all

05:14:07.280 --> 05:14:10.480
Props are going to be bigger more depends on the standard in a way as long as pack of any side

05:14:10.480 --> 05:14:12.720
But remember I suppose my venture out when finny drops too low

05:14:13.440 --> 05:14:18.320
And it's a fleet infestation worse since props will be more likely to leave the den as affinity drops keeping my small

05:14:19.200 --> 05:14:21.200
Okay, pack affinity

05:14:21.680 --> 05:14:23.680
I can't that's so small

05:14:25.120 --> 05:14:27.520
This was at one point they'll be tempted to leave the den

05:14:29.040 --> 05:14:30.880
But like how

05:14:30.880 --> 05:14:35.520
Is if it gets that below I suppose if it gets that okay. Yeah, because I'm like a hundred

05:14:40.160 --> 05:14:45.120
It's my carcass gone bro. I'm about to pee on this fucking marker. I don't even give a shit

05:14:46.080 --> 05:14:48.080
But you're fucking you

05:15:03.360 --> 05:15:05.360

Wonder if I should though diagonal. Yeah, fuck it. We ball

05:15:12.800 --> 05:15:14.800
Seems like everybody's fine

05:15:15.840 --> 05:15:17.840
I'll try to find some food on the way

05:15:20.160 --> 05:15:24.720
Oh, I swear to god, I didn't go that way, but okay go off

05:15:29.680 --> 05:15:32.640

05:15:48.320 --> 05:15:51.680
I'm like honestly really tempted just to keep playing until I beat this

Oh, it's grizzly fuck

05:15:56.400 --> 05:16:00.800
Grizzly better not be going near my babies or we're not gonna have a good time

05:16:02.000 --> 05:16:04.000
What's that?

05:16:06.080 --> 05:16:08.080
Is that

It seems like there's always prawn horn in that little area

05:23:00.560 --> 05:23:03.520
I'm a bad bitch. You can't kill me

05:23:11.360 --> 05:23:15.520
I come home my family's massacre like fucking you she honk land style

05:23:18.960 --> 05:23:21.280
It's like ram the mass wolves

05:23:24.960 --> 05:23:28.800
Run towards the moon. I am going the wrong way

05:23:29.920 --> 05:23:31.920
Excuse me

05:23:32.640 --> 05:23:40.320
Give me a second. I need to get my story straight. My friends are sorry the little shaking noise sounded like that song

05:23:41.680 --> 05:23:47.120
Hey, then the empire's staying in love. She is waiting for me. That's to cross the ball

05:23:47.600 --> 05:23:49.600
Oh

Isn't it someone in the beginning of that asking minus

05:24:00.400 --> 05:24:02.960
Okay, I saw the meat in the mouth. I was like the extra limit

05:24:05.840 --> 05:24:07.840
What the fuck is happening?

05:24:07.840 --> 05:24:09.840
I

05:24:15.200 --> 05:24:17.200
Where's the den?

05:24:19.120 --> 05:24:21.120
Oh my god

05:24:21.360 --> 05:24:28.320
Sometimes it's like it's hidden by my scent marker thing and the whatever so it's not showing me where the den is

05:24:29.360 --> 05:24:33.840
I guess I just go towards that marker since technically I fucking pissed there. Can I follow it?

05:24:38.160 --> 05:24:40.160
I think not

05:24:42.320 --> 05:24:47.520
Perhaps I guess I can maybe it is good that I like fucking pissed on it

05:24:50.320 --> 05:24:52.720
Oh, it actually is a good idea that I pissed on it

05:25:00.080 --> 05:25:02.080

05:26:33.600 --> 05:26:35.600
Okay

05:26:44.960 --> 05:26:46.960

You batch of pups in the oven yet? I have to wait for these ones to grow up

05:27:44.880 --> 05:27:48.000

He's not that far away actually

05:28:06.960 --> 05:28:08.960

05:38:07.620 --> 05:38:14.260
I think is that the stunt marker because I'm pretty sure I did the stunt marker over here. Well, what I'm gonna do right now

05:38:21.540 --> 05:38:23.540
Uh

05:38:25.140 --> 05:38:27.140
Uh-huh purple is wavering fleas

05:38:28.020 --> 05:38:32.980
Where pups stay in the den the faster if you please so they stay outside use the dens for shelter or safety for predators

05:38:34.660 --> 05:38:38.820
Puppies are what likely to leave the den as flea load increases

05:38:39.380 --> 05:38:41.700
keeping out of the blue point in the pack affinity meter

05:38:43.220 --> 05:38:49.060
Marks the point your pups will be tempted to leave the den. Oh, okay. Oh, that's a pointer. That's so weird

05:38:50.900 --> 05:38:52.900
I

05:39:02.420 --> 05:39:04.660
Can't do that with my mouth full there we go

05:39:18.420 --> 05:39:20.420
Cool

05:39:21.460 --> 05:39:23.460
All right might as well go back

05:39:26.180 --> 05:39:32.180
We we got in a pretty good chunk. It's not as big. I would like a corner for ourselves like I keep saying so

05:39:35.220 --> 05:39:37.220
I'll work on that

05:39:44.580 --> 05:39:47.220
I'm gonna just go straight ahead. Yep

05:39:51.300 --> 05:39:56.820
I wish there was an auto run so I don't have to fucking be doing this

05:39:57.140 --> 05:39:59.140
I

05:40:18.740 --> 05:40:21.060
Was thinking I'm like, you know, I don't really have a lot to say today

05:40:22.500 --> 05:40:25.620
Usually I'm like yeah master 3000, but I think just like

05:40:26.900 --> 05:40:28.900
I

05:40:29.460 --> 05:40:33.700
Like shit that how how life be I'm just like I'm just tired today

05:40:35.380 --> 05:40:37.380
And I don't I'm not yapping as much

05:40:40.580 --> 05:40:42.580
Who's that

05:40:43.380 --> 05:40:45.380
Oh the fox

05:40:45.460 --> 05:40:47.460
He's hanging out. I'm not gonna kill him

05:40:49.220 --> 05:40:52.100
Yeah, we're just hanging because have you the background

05:40:53.380 --> 05:40:55.380
Don't have to be nothing serious, you know

05:40:56.340 --> 05:40:58.340
Making myself fucking dizzy playing this

05:41:01.940 --> 05:41:04.420
Game's just too intense. I know it's just too intense

05:41:06.260 --> 05:41:08.260
Like how could I not?

05:41:16.260 --> 05:41:20.980
Oh fleas are there random like dust doubles everywhere

05:41:25.700 --> 05:41:27.700
Where am I?

05:41:29.220 --> 05:41:32.660
Sometimes I like to go see if there's like anything near the oh

05:41:34.260 --> 05:41:36.980
Can I run you guys towards the den?

05:41:39.780 --> 05:41:43.620
Can you run that way go how okay

05:41:45.540 --> 05:41:50.500
Oh, you knocked the meat out of my mouth. No, I have to kill one of you. Which one's a fawn

05:41:51.300 --> 05:41:53.300
Oh

05:41:56.180 --> 05:42:05.460
Looking for a fawn looking for a fawn. Sorry don't mind me. I'm just looking for a fawn. There's a lot of bucks in this herd

05:42:07.380 --> 05:42:09.380
Ah, why are you guys both attacking me?

05:42:17.540 --> 05:42:19.540
Oh do you then

05:42:21.460 --> 05:42:23.460
Now

05:42:27.780 --> 05:42:30.580
Oh, I didn't mean to grab you but this also works

05:42:32.580 --> 05:42:34.660
Well

05:42:34.660 --> 05:42:36.260
She whipped her around

05:42:36.260 --> 05:42:40.340
I might have to come call reinforcements for this one. Oh come back

05:42:45.780 --> 05:42:49.460
Yeah, I don't think I'll be able to fuck can't believe I dropped the meat

05:42:50.660 --> 05:42:56.420
I'll come back to that. Oh, there's an elk is still over here

05:43:01.940 --> 05:43:03.940
Raspberry elk herd that's cute

05:43:09.620 --> 05:43:11.860
What the fuck oh coyotes hello

05:43:14.900 --> 05:43:16.900
Yes some more

05:43:21.140 --> 05:43:32.500
Cool take that to him. I'm happy I killed that nearby. I'm exhausted. I'm going the wrong way

05:43:40.020 --> 05:43:42.020
Bring this back to the hubbin

05:43:42.900 --> 05:43:47.300
Your health is scarily low. No, it's not if it was less if it was

05:43:48.180 --> 05:43:53.460
Yeah, no, it's it's actually not that low. It's low, but it's like it's not that bad

05:43:54.260 --> 05:43:55.780
You know

05:43:55.780 --> 05:43:57.780
It's fine

05:43:59.220 --> 05:44:06.100
I think I accidentally cut off my peeing animation. There we go. I realize sometimes I just pee too fast

05:44:17.700 --> 05:44:23.300
I'm also exhausted. Yeah, yeah, dead nearby. It's probably mine

05:44:30.180 --> 05:44:34.020
Oh, hi Rena. I was wondering where you've been. That's not big mama

05:44:35.540 --> 05:44:39.860
Rena's been pretty chill today. She's been doing her own thing. Hi, you thinking of me?

05:44:40.660 --> 05:44:42.660
I missed you, but whoa

05:44:43.220 --> 05:44:44.660
What's the matter?

05:44:44.660 --> 05:44:49.620
Oh, it's because boomie walked up and she saw him and she got upset. Are you okay?

05:44:52.020 --> 05:44:54.020
No

05:44:54.420 --> 05:44:56.420
It's just me

05:44:56.500 --> 05:44:58.500
Boomi's not around

05:45:01.060 --> 05:45:03.060
She's not happy

05:45:06.580 --> 05:45:09.620
Oh, I see what's going on

05:45:09.620 --> 05:45:13.940
Rina do I got to bring you to the vet again?

05:45:15.540 --> 05:45:20.020
I think Rena Rena is again. She's an older cat. Um

05:45:22.420 --> 05:45:24.420
So sometimes

05:45:25.540 --> 05:45:29.140
She was I was kind of confused because she was acting pretty lethargic today

05:45:30.660 --> 05:45:32.340
Um

05:45:32.340 --> 05:45:36.580
And I was like why are she she's just like kind of hanging out by herself and I'm like what's going on here lady

05:45:37.380 --> 05:45:39.380
and um

05:45:39.380 --> 05:45:45.860
She sometimes gets like one of her uh her glands clogged and I think that's what's going on because

05:45:47.460 --> 05:45:49.460
Boomi leave her alone. She doesn't feel good

05:45:51.220 --> 05:45:54.420
Because her her booty looked weird. Can you move?

05:45:57.060 --> 05:45:59.700
Oopsies I must maybe drop my controller dude

05:46:04.580 --> 05:46:06.580
All right, let me see

05:46:07.540 --> 05:46:11.620
Put that down. There you go. That's for you. It's your meat chunk

05:46:16.500 --> 05:46:18.500
Come and get it

05:46:20.660 --> 05:46:22.660
Come and get it proper tins

05:46:24.740 --> 05:46:26.740
Boomi, please stop tearing up my thing

05:46:27.700 --> 05:46:29.700
Boomi's attacking my foot rest

05:46:30.500 --> 05:46:35.780
Yo, Rena barked. Yeah, she's older. So like sometimes it doesn't it won't express itself

05:46:36.340 --> 05:46:38.340
So I'm probably actually I'm gonna

05:46:39.060 --> 05:46:43.460
Make an appointment for it can't hurt gland express. I've tried to do it myself

05:46:44.340 --> 05:46:46.100
um

05:46:46.100 --> 05:46:50.020
It's just it's really hard. Yeah, I could see it. She's not having a good time

05:46:52.340 --> 05:46:55.940
It's funny because she was like fine yesterday, so I'm wondering if something happened

05:46:59.620 --> 05:47:03.700
Why do you look so mad? She's like I don't feel good my butt hurts

05:47:04.660 --> 05:47:11.220
All right, don't worry miss ma'am. I'll take you to the vet ASAP. So you feel right as rain

05:47:11.940 --> 05:47:16.660
Although you're gonna hate it because you hate having your butt touched, but it is what it is

05:47:22.260 --> 05:47:25.060
Grumpy she's like I don't like it. It's like this

05:47:27.700 --> 05:47:31.300
If I want to be backed up every other month. Yeah, so it's such a weird thing

05:47:31.300 --> 05:47:34.900
It's like she has plenty of fiber. She has it's just like, you know, just age

05:47:35.620 --> 05:47:37.620
She's 14 so

05:47:40.980 --> 05:47:42.980
He's like give me that meat chunk

05:47:51.860 --> 05:47:54.260
Enjoy let's see how the thing is

05:47:55.060 --> 05:48:00.100
And it's so funny that is it okay, is it weird that the game's like rain is sick

05:48:00.180 --> 05:48:05.140
She was sick immediately and then she got better. That's so weird. I'm sorry. That's just weird to me

05:48:09.220 --> 05:48:12.740
That's weird the game's telling me that my own cat's sick

05:48:14.100 --> 05:48:16.100
I didn't mean to lock on a boomy

05:48:16.100 --> 05:48:18.100
There you go

05:48:18.580 --> 05:48:20.580
I

05:48:21.140 --> 05:48:24.020
Said she got better so we're short so we did so we write as rain

05:48:26.740 --> 05:48:30.580
Maybe you're weird I am weird the game knows you

05:48:32.980 --> 05:48:36.020
All right, I think I'm actually am gonna end it here

05:48:36.580 --> 05:48:41.780
I'm wondering if I should just like I really want to finish this game now, but I want to check on rain and make sure she's good

05:48:42.340 --> 05:48:44.340
Maybe I can put some um

05:48:45.060 --> 05:48:46.420
I can give her

05:48:46.420 --> 05:48:50.740
She has pain medication that I can give her so at least she'll be comfortable before I take her to the vet tomorrow

05:48:51.140 --> 05:48:56.020
I have a really nice vet. She's honestly, uh, super close to my family. She um

05:48:57.140 --> 05:48:59.860
Took care of fia when fia was going through her stuff

05:49:00.900 --> 05:49:07.140
Um, and it was like she was so nice because she would literally just give us stuff. Um, like me and my current stuff are free

05:49:07.940 --> 05:49:09.940
um

05:49:10.340 --> 05:49:17.380
Like I had to like get medication. She's like, no, it's free and I'm like, oh because she like I was spending again like I've spent

05:49:18.340 --> 05:49:23.140
Like eight over eight thousand dollars on getting fia better and they still don't know

05:49:23.300 --> 05:49:26.100
They still don't know what caused her legs to stop working

05:49:26.740 --> 05:49:32.900
They still don't know they ran so many tests cat scans all the scans MRIs

05:49:33.700 --> 05:49:37.380
Ultra sounds they still don't know she's she's like, oh, she was perfectly fine

05:49:37.460 --> 05:49:40.740
I don't know why this is happening. Like is she is she doing it for attention?

05:49:46.420 --> 05:49:50.420
Cat scans but don't oh, oh, oh, oh. They're just so funny. Where did fia go?

05:49:53.380 --> 05:49:56.980
Um, I'm missing a child

05:49:56.980 --> 05:50:09.620
Let me go check if she's in here.

05:50:09.620 --> 05:50:12.740
Wait, is this a save and pack info?

05:50:12.740 --> 05:50:15.660
Oh yeah, Fiat isn't dead.

05:50:15.660 --> 05:50:17.180
Oh, it means 10 pounds.

05:50:17.180 --> 05:50:19.740
Okay, we're getting close.

05:50:19.740 --> 05:50:20.740
I'm gonna save.

05:50:20.740 --> 05:50:25.420
I have to save it as something?

05:50:25.420 --> 05:50:26.420
Can I just save it?

05:50:26.420 --> 05:50:44.180
Um, save it as Reina Grumpy.

05:50:44.180 --> 05:50:55.020
Here we go.

05:50:56.020 --> 05:50:57.020
Perfect.

05:50:57.020 --> 05:51:04.020
It didn't even, it doesn't even work when I type with the controller.

05:51:04.020 --> 05:51:09.020
Reina Grumpy.

05:51:09.020 --> 05:51:12.020
Save you.

05:51:12.020 --> 05:51:15.020
Alright.

Thank you guys for watching.

05:51:18.020 --> 05:51:20.020
I'll let you know I didn't hit submit.

05:51:20.020 --> 05:51:22.020
Oh, I thought that was submit thing.

05:51:22.020 --> 05:51:24.020
Look how pretty I am.

05:51:24.020 --> 05:51:25.020

05:51:29.020 --> 05:51:34.020
I'm gonna look through, make sure I don't miss any streamer.

05:51:34.020 --> 05:51:40.020
Oh, what is this?

05:51:40.020 --> 05:51:44.020
Alright, I think I called those all out.

05:51:44.020 --> 05:51:45.020
Cool, cool, cool.

05:51:45.020 --> 05:51:46.020
Thank you guys for your support today.

05:51:46.020 --> 05:51:47.020
I appreciate it.

05:51:47.020 --> 05:51:48.020
You guys are bomb.

05:51:48.020 --> 05:51:55.020
I have to put up my fucking, whatchamacallit.

05:51:55.020 --> 05:52:04.020
Reina, just like that in the live.

05:52:04.020 --> 05:52:05.020
Schedule up.

05:52:05.020 --> 05:52:09.020
I have a members, members stream tomorrow.

05:52:09.020 --> 05:52:13.020
We're gonna do the tier list, the tag tier list.

05:52:13.020 --> 05:52:14.020
That'll be fun.

05:52:14.020 --> 05:52:17.020
I have to ask Strawny what she used for hers or anything.

05:52:17.020 --> 05:52:19.020
But I'll see you guys around.

05:52:19.020 --> 05:52:20.020
Bye.

05:52:20.020 --> 05:52:29.020
