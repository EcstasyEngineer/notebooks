01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:07,360
We're really really close.

696
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:09,360
If we could just serve one more.

697
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:11,360
I need the tortilla.

698
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:13,360
I just put the one on the plate.

699
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:15,360
Oh I see.

700
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:17,360
Oh it's 400.

701
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:19,360
I thought it was 280.

702
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:21,360
Oh my god.

703
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:23,360
Alright.

704
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:25,360
This is difficult.

705
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:27,360
Difficult.

706
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:29,360
My brain would just sit to great plates.

707
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:31,360
What would you put?

708
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:33,360
What would you put?

709
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:35,360
What would you put?

710
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:37,360
Topping, gaming.

711
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:39,360
I don't know.

712
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:41,360
I don't know about that.

713
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:43,360
I think I'm too epi.

714
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:45,360
Epi. Epi. Wake up. Wake up shower girl.

715
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:47,360
Wake up.

716
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:49,360
The showers make me epi too.

717
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:51,360
I'm so tired.

718
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:53,360
I was gonna blame it on me being tired.

719
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:55,360
It's because you're a mom.

720
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:57,360
You're a mom.

721
01:27:57,360 --> 01:27:59,360
After I have to wake up early.

722
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:01,360
You know.

723
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:03,360
The job.

724
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:05,360
Mommy's having a very early bed.

725
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:07,360
On the streets.

726
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:09,360
No.

727
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:11,360
No you're right.

728
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:13,360
I'm a high class escort.

729
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:15,360
You're high class.

730
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:17,360
People travel the world to see you.

731
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:19,360
Exactly.

732
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:21,360
To my hotel.

733
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:23,360
I can't even get my lore right.

734
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:25,360
No more I am.

735
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:27,360
Where am I?

736
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:29,360
Where am I?

737
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:31,360
Where am I?

738
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:33,360
Oh fuck me in the butt cheeks.

739
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:35,360
We can just throw the meat thankfully.

740
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:37,360
Cut these chai.

741
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:39,360
Oh what the fuck.

742
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:45,360
Oh no.

743
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:47,360
Just try to throw it.

744
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:53,360
Grab the rice.

745
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:55,360
Grab the rice that you need.

746
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:01,360
Okay I'm gonna go take this plate.

747
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:03,360
Cool.

748
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:05,360
There's a plate on the thing on the edge.

749
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:07,360
Just grab it.

750
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:09,360
Oh my god thank you.

751
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:11,360
I delivered it to you.

752
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:13,360
Thank you.

753
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:15,360
I need rice.

754
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:17,360
There's some rice.

755
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:19,360
There's a rice there already.

756
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:21,360
Rice me.

757
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:23,360
Rice me.

758
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:25,360
I can't throw the plate.

759
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:27,360
It would have been so much easier.

760
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:29,360
I swear couldn't we throw it before?

761
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:31,360
I don't think so.

762
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:33,360
I mean in a dream I had

763
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:35,360
I swear we could have thrown this.

764
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:37,360
Oh my god.

765
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:39,360
I have a dream about you Shibby.

766
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:41,360
Remember?

767
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:43,360
I can't remember.

768
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:45,360
I don't remember.

769
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:47,360
I think he told me that we hung out

770
01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:49,360
or something.

771
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:51,360
I had a dream.

772
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:53,360
Me, you and Nori

773
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:55,360
we had to perform improv.

774
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:57,360
Oh yeah that's right.

775
01:29:57,360 --> 01:29:59,360
But then Nori didn't show up

776
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:01,360
so we had to improvise.

777
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:03,360
We had to improvise.

778
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:05,360
That is so not me.

779
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:07,360
I fucking love improv.

780
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:09,360
Yeah.

781
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:11,360
You were busy that day.

782
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:13,360
You had stuff to do.

783
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:15,360
I have so much rice over here.

784
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:17,360
I need rice so bad.

785
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:19,360
It's gonna crash, it's gonna break it.

786
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:21,360
And then the minute we converge

787
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:23,360
I'm gonna grab those two

788
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:25,360
boiling things of rice.

789
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:27,360
Move bitch, sorry.

790
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:33,360
It's fine, it's fine.

791
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:35,360
There's an order right in front of you.

792
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:37,360
Grab.

793
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:39,360
I fell handed out.

794
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:41,360
I'm just grabbing tortillas

795
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:43,360
so I can grab them.

796
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:45,360
Now that order is done.

797
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:47,360
No, this rice isn't ready.

798
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:49,360
I was like that is a lot.

799
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:51,360
Here's a plate.

800
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:53,360
I'm stacking them up for you.

801
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:55,360
Can I not stack them up?

802
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:57,360
It's fine.

803
01:30:57,360 --> 01:30:59,360
I'm gonna plate these for you.

804
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:01,360
No.

805
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:03,360
Oh that's ready.

806
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:05,360
So those two plates have

807
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:07,360
tortillas.

808
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:09,360
Tortillas.

809
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:11,360
Tortillas.

810
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:13,360
Where are you?

811
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:15,360
People need me to say.

812
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:17,360
No I need those plates.

813
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:19,360
I really need it.

814
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:21,360
I really need it.

815
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:23,360
Thank you.

816
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:25,360
I need rice actually.

817
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:27,360
I have rice over here.

818
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:29,360
That's a plate as well.

819
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:31,360
Can I like...

820
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:33,360
You should be able to...

821
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:35,360
They're not cooked yet.

822
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:37,360
This one isn't cooked.

823
01:31:37,360 --> 01:31:39,360
This one's cooked.

824
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:41,360
See you little lady.

825
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:43,360
That tortilla has rice in it.

826
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:45,360
Oh perfect.

827
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:47,360
I'm gonna cook some of these for you.

828
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:49,360
It's fine.

829
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:51,360
You have them.

830
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:53,360
You have any rice?

831
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:55,360
I gave you some rice.

832
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:57,360
It's right behind you.

833
01:31:57,360 --> 01:31:59,360
Oh perfect.

834
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:01,360
Here's a bowl.

835
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:03,360
Yeah!

836
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:05,360
That's cool!

837
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:07,360
You can also just drop it in the ocean

838
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:09,360
like this.

839
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:11,360
Oh really?

840
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:13,360
If I drop this?

841
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:15,360
No not that.

842
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:17,360
I meant the bowl.

843
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:19,360
Oh the bowl.

844
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:21,360
Where am I?

845
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:25,360
Oh my god!

846
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:27,360
We did it!

847
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:29,360
We did it!

848
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:31,360
All these girls had a dream where they played the same game.

849
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:33,360
Isn't that weird?

850
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:35,360
I know it's so weird how that happens.

851
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:37,360
I'm so in that dream.

852
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:39,360
Psychically connected or whatever.

853
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:41,360
Yeah I feel like I'm like, you know,

854
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:43,360
so connected to Sheebie

855
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:45,360
in some weird dream.

856
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:47,360
Weird dream.

857
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:49,360
She's my mother.

858
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:51,360
She's my mom.

859
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:53,360
Watching this makes me want food.

860
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:55,360
I know I want like,

861
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:57,360
I want like her burrito so bad.

862
01:32:57,360 --> 01:32:59,360
Yeah this is me.

863
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:01,360
I did not eat and I'm hungry.

864
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:03,360
Same.

865
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:05,360
I only ate a bowl of cereal today.

866
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:07,360
Yeah!

867
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:09,360
I know I had a salad.

868
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:11,360
I had a cookie.

869
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:13,360
I only ate a bowl of cereal.

870
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:15,360
Hold on,

871
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:17,360
Siri's talking to me.

872
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:19,360
She scared the shit out of me.

873
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:21,360
Siri stop!

874
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:23,360
Siri! Hi Siri!

875
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:25,360
Wait I didn't mean to do that.

876
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:27,360
No Siri!

877
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:29,360
Wait what?

878
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:31,360
This is a nightmare.

879
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:33,360
I didn't mean to do that.

880
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:35,360
Hi Siri!

881
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:37,360
Call?

882
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:39,360
Call?

883
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:41,360
Do we have to go back to the castle?

884
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:43,360
Call mom!

885
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:45,360
Did Siri just dox me?

886
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:47,360
I couldn't hear what it was saying.

887
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:49,360
It just said your full name but that was all.

888
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:51,360
Oh okay, that's great.

889
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:53,360
She be caught in one.

890
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:55,360
She be caught in one.

891
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:57,360
She be caught in one?

892
01:33:57,360 --> 01:33:59,360
She be caught in one.

893
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:01,360
My favorite cereal.

894
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:03,360
My favorite cereal.

895
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:05,360
Wait oh my god.

896
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:07,360
Wait we can read it this time.

897
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:09,360
Because we're as new.

898
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:11,360
We can't read.

899
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:13,360
Is he going to talk to us?

900
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:15,360
Oh we have to go.

901
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:17,360
Bye bark!

902
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:19,360
Who's there?

903
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:21,360
Come at me if you want to.

904
01:34:21,360 --> 01:34:23,360
Fuck. Oh thank goodness.

905
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:25,360
It's you and look at you.

906
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:27,360
So united, so cooperative.

907
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:29,360
Yes.

908
01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:31,360
You're going from strength to strength at a rapid speed.

909
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:33,360
But the unbred are still too powerful.

910
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:35,360
Unbred.

911
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:37,360
Bark!

912
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:41,360
You think?

913
01:34:41,360 --> 01:34:43,360
Oh dear, it seems we must send you

914
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:45,360
through the haunted swamps to the south.

915
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:47,360
I know, I know.

916
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:49,360
No one ever returns from Texas.

917
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:51,360
But these are desperate times.

918
01:34:51,360 --> 01:34:53,360
No, no, no, no, no!

919
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:55,360
Texas, no!

920
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:57,360
You're brave, you're bold like Batman.

921
01:34:57,360 --> 01:34:59,360
You're the greatest band who ever lived.

922
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:01,360
Why are we a band?

923
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:03,360
I don't like that.

924
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:05,360
Nothing can stop you.

925
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:07,360
Why are you waving?

926
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:09,360
Except maybe the possessed baguette.

927
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:11,360
That's been chasing Kevin around

928
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:13,360
all morning.

929
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:15,360
What?

930
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:17,360
Baguette.

931
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:19,360
There's no need to take his meds.

932
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:21,360
We will hold off the horde.

933
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:23,360
Now go!

934
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:25,360
Okay.

935
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:29,360
The swamp.

936
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:31,360
We're going to Florida, guys.

937
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:33,360
Wait, I can swear?

938
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:35,360
That's my little character.

939
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:37,360
Yeah, yeah, you see like bits.

940
01:35:37,360 --> 01:35:39,360
I mean, they're really like kitchen.

941
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:41,360
Kitchen people, they curse a lot.

942
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:43,360
They're like, bit.

943
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:45,360
Bit.

944
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:47,360
Okay, this looks a lot easier.

945
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:49,360
Except it's probably not far.

946
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:51,360
I can't take my meds.

947
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:53,360
Oh, we know.

948
01:35:53,360 --> 01:35:55,360
Japan.

949
01:35:55,360 --> 01:35:57,360
Japan.

950
01:35:57,360 --> 01:35:59,360
Sorry, where are we, Chai?

951
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:01,360
Japan.

952
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:03,360
Japan.

953
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:05,360
Wait.

954
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:07,360
Oh, we're making sushi.

955
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:09,360
That's right.

956
01:36:09,360 --> 01:36:11,360
Okay.

957
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:15,360
Wait, what am I?

958
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:17,360
Fuck!

959
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:19,360
No, no, no, guys.

960
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:21,360
No, guys, guys, guys.

961
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:23,360
Don't throw it back to me.

962
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:25,360
I'm trying.

963
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:27,360
I'm chopping and it does it.

964
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:29,360
Shrimp, shrimp, shrimp.

965
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:31,360
Shrimp, shrimp, shrimp.

966
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:33,360
Don't try, try to put it back.

967
01:36:33,360 --> 01:36:35,360
You didn't cut it.

968
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:37,360
Oh, let's die.

969
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:39,360
Shrimp.

970
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:41,360
Um, can I have sushi?

971
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:43,360
Cool.

972
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:45,360
Shrimp.

973
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:47,360
Oh, I need rice.

974
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:49,360
Shrimp.

975
01:36:49,360 --> 01:36:51,360
Shrimp.

976
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:53,360
Oh.

977
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:55,360
Is this correct?

978
01:36:55,360 --> 01:36:57,360
Who do I give this to?

979
01:36:57,360 --> 01:36:59,360
Oh.

980
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:01,360
Imagine?

981
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:03,360
Imagine working at a kitchen where you had to

982
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:05,360
cross the street to hand it out.

983
01:37:07,360 --> 01:37:09,360
Oh, wait, I need rice.

984
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:11,360
I need rice for this one.

985
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:13,360
This one needs rice. This is almost done.

986
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:15,360
Chai's just standing there.

987
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:17,360
Chai's making the brown one.

988
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:19,360
I mean, no, no, no, no, no.

989
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:21,360
Look at this girl.

990
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:23,360
She looks just like me.

991
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:25,360
She does.

992
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:27,360
Okay.

993
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:29,360
So, what do I do?

994
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:31,360
Cut that.

995
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:35,360
Oh, my God.

996
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:39,360
No, I put something down in front of me

997
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:41,360
and I fucked it up.

998
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:47,360
Wait, this is an order.

999
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:49,360
Excuse me, excuse me, sorry.

1000
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:51,360
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

1001
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:53,360
Excuse me, sorry, sorry.

1002
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:55,360
Oh, there's one with just

1003
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:57,360
shrimp the hell?

1004
01:37:57,360 --> 01:37:59,360
Yes, yes, yes, yes, I got it.

1005
01:37:59,360 --> 01:38:01,360
I got it in time. I got it in time.

1006
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:03,360
Oh, well, this is useless. I need to dump this out.

1007
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:05,360
Where's the trash?

1008
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:07,360
Wait, I got so much rice.

1009
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:09,360
Yeah, yeah.

1010
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:11,360
Wait, that's not, is that?

1011
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:13,360
I can't. Why is it?

1012
01:38:13,360 --> 01:38:15,360
I don't know.

1013
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:17,360
It's making me confused.

1014
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:19,360
I don't like it.

1015
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:21,360
Why is it a taco?

1016
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:23,360
Have you guys ever had like, um,

1017
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:25,360
shrimp burritos?

1018
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:27,360
No, I don't have that one.

1019
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:29,360
It's a big burrito, but it's like shrimp.

1020
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:31,360
Oh, okay, never mind.

1021
01:38:31,360 --> 01:38:33,360
Or I mean sushi.

1022
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:35,360
Oh, yes, I've had a sushi burrito before.

1023
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:37,360
I've never had sushi before.

1024
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:39,360
You're fucking lying.

1025
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:41,360
What do you eat?

1026
01:38:41,360 --> 01:38:43,360
Grass.

1027
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:45,360
Why literally nothing sometimes?

1028
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:47,360
I eat like a meal a day.

1029
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:49,360
I'll just go about my day.

1030
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:51,360
I'll just have like a piece of bread

1031
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:53,360
and coffee.

1032
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:55,360
It's like, alright, I'm gonna start my day.

1033
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:57,360
That's just, yeah.

1034
01:38:57,360 --> 01:38:59,360
Oh, no, okay, it's fine.

1035
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:01,360
Everything's fine.

1036
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:03,360
We need three.

1037
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:05,360
What?

1038
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:07,360
We need three.

1039
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:09,360
We saw, okay, this is weird.

1040
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:11,360
Okay.

1041
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:13,360
We also have plain ones,

1042
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:15,360
like the plain shrimp and the plain tuna.

1043
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:17,360
Yeah.

1044
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:19,360
Yeah, is it that normal to be able to eat

1045
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:21,360
like not eat sushi?

1046
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:23,360
I don't know.

1047
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:25,360
I've had like

1048
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:27,360
spring rolls,

1049
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:29,360
but that's not sushi.

1050
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:31,360
Oh, we can all go out for sushi.

1051
01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:33,360
A collab for sushi.

1052
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:35,360
Yeah, I'm gonna have a burger,

1053
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:37,360
a cheeseburger.

1054
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:39,360
Oh, okay.

1055
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:41,360
Listen to me, ladies.

1056
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:43,360
I am going to bring you the fish

1057
01:39:43,360 --> 01:39:45,360
and you will cut it and I will bring you plates.

1058
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:47,360
And then you will plate.

1059
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:49,360
No, no, listen to me. You're gonna put the plates here.

1060
01:39:49,360 --> 01:39:51,360
Okay, you're not gonna move them.

1061
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:53,360
You're not gonna...

1062
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:55,360
It comes on the conveyor belt.

1063
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:57,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, like a sushi thing.

1064
01:39:57,360 --> 01:39:59,360
I'm sorry.

1065
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:01,360
What?

1066
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:03,360
Don't laugh at me.

1067
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:05,360
Don't laugh at me.

1068
01:40:05,360 --> 01:40:07,360
Okay.

1069
01:40:07,360 --> 01:40:09,360
Okay, I need

1070
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:11,360

I was just talking about this earlier. So I'm really um

1260
01:53:52,840 --> 01:53:56,040
Insecure about only having four toes on each foot

1261
01:53:56,760 --> 01:54:01,240
So it's kind of like a confidence building thing. You have four toes. Yeah

1262
01:54:02,520 --> 01:54:06,440
Someone's like wait like legit or no, I'm just joking. Okay

1263
01:54:07,640 --> 01:54:12,840

One, I don't eat hot dogs and two. I despise ketchup. I don't like hot dogs either

1276
01:54:54,200 --> 01:54:59,160
I think ketchup is fucking disgusting. I prefer sausages and then I just use them. I usually have them plain

01:55:38,120 --> 01:55:41,320
I'm very autistic guys. It's it's really bad. Do you like the vinegar?

1287

Yeah, I think it's the vinegar because I can I can eat things with vinegar, right? But ketchup

1288
01:55:45,960 --> 01:55:47,960
I don't know why it just makes me like I want to puke

01:55:50,200 --> 01:55:55,720
I think it's gross. I like ketchup. It was nice. Do you like tomatoes? I love tomatoes, which is weird

02:01:27,320 --> 02:01:29,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, cute, cute pet names.

1398
02:01:30,040 --> 02:01:32,120
It should have been me, it's never gonna be you, by the way,

1399
02:01:32,120 --> 02:01:32,920
it's always gonna be me.

1400
02:01:36,200 --> 02:01:40,120
I don't know, no, our second language in Canada is French,

1401
02:01:40,200 --> 02:01:43,160
so, like, I got zero Spanish skill.

1402
02:01:43,160 --> 02:01:44,360
I got zero Spanish game.

1403
02:01:45,960 --> 02:01:48,280
I don't know how to, I just know how to say my name,

1404
02:01:48,280 --> 02:01:50,680
and I was not gonna say my name in French.

1405
02:01:51,320 --> 02:01:51,720
It's just...

1406
02:01:51,720 --> 02:01:53,080
Xemaphone, China!

1407
02:01:53,080 --> 02:01:55,400
Xemaphone, Nauri, Kao.

1408
02:01:55,400 --> 02:01:56,360
Xemaphone, Shibi.

1409
02:01:57,080 --> 02:01:58,120
I can do a corn.

1410
02:01:58,120 --> 02:01:59,480
Like, can you guys do any accents?

1411
02:02:00,600 --> 02:02:01,960
Oh, it's hard to accent.

1412
02:02:01,960 --> 02:02:02,840
Like, what's hard to accent?

1413
02:02:02,840 --> 02:02:03,320
Like, I don't know.

1414
02:02:04,200 --> 02:02:05,160
What the fuck was that?

1415
02:02:06,360 --> 02:02:07,560
Australia!

1416
02:02:08,520 --> 02:02:10,200
Wait, wait, I got a word about...

1417
02:02:11,320 --> 02:02:12,120
What?

1418
02:02:12,120 --> 02:02:13,320
Down by the river!

1419
02:02:16,200 --> 02:02:16,680
Perfect.

1420
02:02:17,240 --> 02:02:18,280
What the fuck is this?

1421
02:02:18,920 --> 02:02:20,040
Australian!

1422
02:02:21,080 --> 02:02:22,360
I'm Australian!

1423
02:02:24,680 --> 02:02:25,080
See?

1424
02:02:25,960 --> 02:02:26,280
See?

1425
02:02:28,600 --> 02:02:30,520
I can't, my cheeks hurt too much.

1426
02:02:31,400 --> 02:02:33,560
I can only do, like, a southern accent,

1427
02:02:33,560 --> 02:02:36,040
but then I get to really racist really fast,

1428
02:02:36,040 --> 02:02:37,320
so I won't do that.

1429
02:02:37,880 --> 02:02:38,760
Wait, how can...

1430
02:02:38,760 --> 02:02:41,560
How is a southern accent racist?

1431
02:02:41,560 --> 02:02:43,400
It just brings out the best in me.

1432
02:02:45,400 --> 02:02:46,440
Oh, I see what you mean.

1433
02:02:46,440 --> 02:02:47,080
Like, it just...

1434
02:02:47,080 --> 02:02:49,000
The America just takes over.

1435
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,080
Yeah, America, the fucking...

1436
02:02:52,520 --> 02:02:53,480
American, I mean.

1437
02:02:53,480 --> 02:02:54,120
Today!

1438
02:02:54,920 --> 02:02:58,920
Should we normalize Peter Griffin ASMR roleplay?

1439
02:02:58,920 --> 02:02:59,480
What?

1440
02:02:59,480 --> 02:02:59,800
What?

1441
02:03:01,320 --> 02:03:01,960
Peter!

1442
02:03:02,920 --> 02:03:04,440
Peter, I don't know why she's...

1443
02:03:05,560 --> 02:03:06,440
Hoss is here.

1444
02:03:08,360 --> 02:03:10,360
Chad, you should try Scottish.

1445
02:03:10,360 --> 02:03:12,120
Can you do a Scottish accent?

1446
02:03:12,120 --> 02:03:12,920
Yeah, do it, do it.

1447
02:03:13,720 --> 02:03:14,360
Me?

1448
02:03:14,360 --> 02:03:14,680
Yes.

1449
02:03:15,400 --> 02:03:15,800
Thank you.

1450
02:03:17,800 --> 02:03:20,040
Whoa, whoa, whoa, scrolling!

1451
02:03:24,280 --> 02:03:25,480
Just scrolling!

1452
02:03:26,680 --> 02:03:27,800
Just scrolling!

1453
02:03:27,800 --> 02:03:30,200
Does it sound like just mimic Shrek?

1454
02:03:31,720 --> 02:03:32,520
Don't care!

1455
02:03:32,520 --> 02:03:33,720
Don't care!

1456
02:03:33,720 --> 02:03:34,760
Don't care!

1457
02:03:34,760 --> 02:03:37,160
What are you doing in my swamp?

1458
02:03:38,120 --> 02:03:39,320
Yeah, I'm not swamped.

1459
02:03:39,320 --> 02:03:39,800
Or...

1460
02:03:39,800 --> 02:03:40,440
Or...

1461
02:03:40,440 --> 02:03:42,360
Let's go daddy to Pullman get some...

1462
02:03:43,880 --> 02:03:44,760
tall points.

1463
02:03:45,480 --> 02:03:45,960
That's right.

1464
02:03:45,960 --> 02:03:46,520
Yeah, that's right.

1465
02:03:46,520 --> 02:03:47,720
Kind of blends...

1466
02:03:47,720 --> 02:03:49,640
Yeah, yeah, I always slip into British

1467
02:03:49,640 --> 02:03:51,480
when I try to do Australian or Scottish.

1468
02:03:51,480 --> 02:03:53,720
The Yankee, isn't Yankee like the...

1469
02:03:54,680 --> 02:03:55,000
the...

1470
02:03:55,800 --> 02:03:56,840
New York.

1471
02:03:56,840 --> 02:03:57,880
Yeah, yeah, East Coast.

1472
02:03:57,880 --> 02:03:59,160
And walk in here.

1473
02:04:00,200 --> 02:04:02,360
I'm walking in, I'm walking in!

1474
02:04:02,360 --> 02:04:04,200
Yeah, wait me!

1475
02:04:05,400 --> 02:04:07,080
They need to turn into Australia?

1476
02:04:07,880 --> 02:04:09,560
It just keeps going back?

1477
02:04:09,560 --> 02:04:11,000
I can't control it!

1478
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:14,200
Say optimize my performance in a British accent.

1479
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:15,800
What?

1480
02:04:15,800 --> 02:04:16,680
Optimize...

1481
02:04:18,840 --> 02:04:21,560
Optimize my performance.

1482
02:04:21,560 --> 02:04:24,120
Optimize my performance.

1483
02:04:24,120 --> 02:04:26,040
Optimize my performance.

1484
02:04:26,040 --> 02:04:27,640
Oh, mommy, sweet Jesus.

1485
02:04:27,640 --> 02:04:28,520
If I...

1486
02:04:28,520 --> 02:04:30,600
If I was a boy, if I was a boy,

1487
02:04:30,600 --> 02:04:32,760
my weenie would be very wrecked.

1488
02:04:32,760 --> 02:04:34,520
It's a really stigma card, you.

1489
02:04:35,320 --> 02:04:36,680
My clip just jumped.

1490
02:04:37,880 --> 02:04:39,880
This is really deactivating you.

1491
02:04:39,880 --> 02:04:41,800
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1492
02:04:41,800 --> 02:04:43,000
What does that even mean?

1493
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:46,280
Is this German accent?

1494
02:04:47,480 --> 02:04:48,120
I can't do it.

1495
02:04:48,120 --> 02:04:49,560
I can't do German.

1496
02:04:49,560 --> 02:04:50,360
I think I can do it.

1497
02:04:50,360 --> 02:04:52,200
I think I really have to focus,

1498
02:04:52,200 --> 02:04:53,800
and then it comes out.

1499
02:04:53,800 --> 02:04:56,200
It's like out of my control sometimes.

1500
02:04:56,200 --> 02:05:00,040
Who can make the most racist accent challenge?

1501
02:05:00,040 --> 02:05:00,680
I got you.

1502
02:05:00,680 --> 02:05:01,880
Probably Nori.

1503
02:05:01,880 --> 02:05:03,000
Probably Nori.

1504
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:03,640
Right.

1505
02:05:04,840 --> 02:05:05,320
Actually...

1506
02:05:05,320 --> 02:05:06,280
I definitely can.

1507
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:07,960
Southern...

1508
02:05:07,960 --> 02:05:09,960
Dad, I'm down in Texas today.

1509
02:05:10,440 --> 02:05:11,880
All right, that's pretty good.

1510
02:05:11,880 --> 02:05:13,320
I'm gonna get in my truck,

1511
02:05:13,320 --> 02:05:16,200
and I'm gonna go get some guns.

1512
02:05:16,200 --> 02:05:17,320
You're gonna get some guns?

1513
02:05:17,320 --> 02:05:18,040
I love Americans.

1514
02:05:18,040 --> 02:05:19,640
I love me and my guns.

1515
02:05:19,640 --> 02:05:21,000
I love being American.

1516
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,960
My first amendment right is my pistol whipping guns.

1517
02:05:25,160 --> 02:05:26,440
I have a large gun point.

1518
02:05:26,440 --> 02:05:27,640
You know the Capitol.

1519
02:05:27,640 --> 02:05:28,040
Choo!

1520
02:05:28,040 --> 02:05:31,160
Yeah, let's go raid the Capitol.

1521
02:05:31,160 --> 02:05:32,040
No, no, Tommy.

1522
02:05:32,040 --> 02:05:33,000
Let's go storm that Capitol building.

1523
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:34,280
Let's go storm that Capitol building.

1524
02:05:34,280 --> 02:05:35,560
Oh, yeah, let...

1525
02:05:35,560 --> 02:05:36,920
Yee-haw, let's do that.

1526
02:05:37,560 --> 02:05:38,280
Yeah, let's do that.

1527
02:05:38,280 --> 02:05:39,160
What gun would I use?

1528
02:05:39,160 --> 02:05:42,360
I would use an AK-47 or a military-grade gun.

1529
02:05:42,360 --> 02:05:43,240
I'll tell you what.

1530
02:05:43,800 --> 02:05:44,520
I'll tell you what.

1531
02:05:44,520 --> 02:05:44,920
I'll tell you what.

1532
02:05:44,920 --> 02:05:46,120
I'll tell you what.

1533
02:05:46,120 --> 02:05:47,080
I'll tell you what.

1534
02:05:47,080 --> 02:05:49,480
I'll use a goddamn military-grade gun

1535
02:05:49,480 --> 02:05:51,880
if I have to shoot down the goddamn...

1536
02:05:51,880 --> 02:05:52,600
Games?

1537
02:05:52,600 --> 02:05:54,520
Yeah, shoot down the range.

1538
02:05:55,880 --> 02:05:58,280
Take advantage of the second amendment.

1539
02:05:58,280 --> 02:06:00,360
I love taking advantage of the second amendment.

1540
02:06:01,480 --> 02:06:02,680
What's the second amendment?

1541
02:06:03,560 --> 02:06:04,840
I think it's like guns.

1542
02:06:04,840 --> 02:06:07,160
I think it's the right to bear arms.

1543
02:06:07,160 --> 02:06:08,360
No, America.

1544
02:06:08,360 --> 02:06:09,560
I love eagles.

1545
02:06:09,560 --> 02:06:10,680
I love eagles.

1546
02:06:10,680 --> 02:06:12,120
Well, I love eagles and I love...

1547
02:06:12,120 --> 02:06:12,840
It's my sister.

1548
02:06:12,840 --> 02:06:13,960
What's that kilometer?

1549
02:06:13,960 --> 02:06:15,800
I don't know American freedom units.

1550
02:06:16,760 --> 02:06:17,800
Artificial flavors.

1551
02:06:18,360 --> 02:06:20,280
Artificial flavors.

1552
02:06:21,480 --> 02:06:22,280
I'll go Alabama.

1553
02:06:22,840 --> 02:06:24,760
I'll go Alabama if she be right now.

1554
02:06:24,760 --> 02:06:26,280
I'll tell you what right now.

1555
02:06:26,280 --> 02:06:27,080
I love my mother.

1556
02:06:28,120 --> 02:06:30,200
K-Y-S, which means kiss your sister.

1557
02:06:30,200 --> 02:06:31,560
Don't mind if I fucking do.

1558
02:06:32,360 --> 02:06:34,440
I'll true, I'll true that.

1559
02:06:34,440 --> 02:06:35,880
True that, true that.

1560
02:06:36,600 --> 02:06:37,880
Someone asked in your chat,

1561
02:06:37,880 --> 02:06:40,280
what D&D race and class would you all play?

1562
02:06:42,520 --> 02:06:43,720
Necromancer.

1563
02:06:43,720 --> 02:06:46,200
And I'd be like the smallest class ever.

1564
02:06:46,200 --> 02:06:48,120
So a half-foot or a dwarf.

1565
02:06:48,120 --> 02:06:49,560
But I'd be a necromancer.

1566
02:06:50,200 --> 02:06:51,880
I was also going to say necromancer

1567
02:06:51,880 --> 02:06:53,160
and I'd probably just be an elf.

1568
02:06:54,200 --> 02:06:55,640
Wait, what's the question?

1569
02:06:56,280 --> 02:06:58,760
Oh, what D&D class and race would you be?

1570
02:06:59,480 --> 02:07:03,080
Oh, I would be a dark elf rogue.

1571
02:07:03,960 --> 02:07:05,480
I totally see that, yeah.

1572
02:07:05,480 --> 02:07:06,280
Gonna be black?

1573
02:07:07,640 --> 02:07:08,600
Are you black?

1574
02:07:08,600 --> 02:07:09,880
I think we've already established

1575
02:07:09,880 --> 02:07:11,960
that Chai has wanted to be black this entire stream.

1576
02:07:11,960 --> 02:07:13,640
Oh my god, he's not swear.

1577
02:07:13,640 --> 02:07:14,680
He loves you so much.

1578
02:07:14,680 --> 02:07:17,160
Chai wants to race mix.

1579
02:07:17,800 --> 02:07:19,400
It's a coincidence, it's a coincidence.

1580
02:07:19,400 --> 02:07:21,560
She wants to make many versions of me.

1581
02:07:21,560 --> 02:07:24,920
Ever since I was young, I felt like I was Japanese.

1582
02:07:28,840 --> 02:07:29,560
That's so true.

1583
02:07:29,560 --> 02:07:32,920
In every state but physical, I am Japanese.

1584
02:07:34,280 --> 02:07:34,520
Hi.

1585
02:07:34,520 --> 02:07:35,640
I represent Japanese.

1586
02:07:36,360 --> 02:07:36,680
Hi.

1587
02:07:38,200 --> 02:07:38,680
Hi.

1588
02:07:38,680 --> 02:07:39,080
I'm all level.

1589
02:07:39,080 --> 02:07:39,160
I'm all level.

1590
02:07:39,160 --> 02:07:39,320
I'm all level.

1591
02:07:39,320 --> 02:07:39,720
I'm all level.

1592
02:07:39,720 --> 02:07:41,320
You're so dead to your heart.

1593
02:07:41,320 --> 02:07:42,040
I am a wolf.

1594
02:07:46,680 --> 02:07:49,320
Is that the CbCottenbum and Chai?

1595
02:07:49,320 --> 02:07:51,560
Oh yeah, I guess I'm fucking Rico, I guess.

1596
02:07:51,560 --> 02:07:52,680
Fuck me, I guess, man.

1597
02:07:52,680 --> 02:07:52,920
Fuck.

1598
02:07:53,560 --> 02:07:54,360
Fuck the person.

1599
02:07:54,360 --> 02:07:55,560
Well, I don't know where to look.

1600
02:07:56,280 --> 02:07:59,160
Someone went inside the CbCottenbum and Chai.

1601
02:07:59,160 --> 02:07:59,640
Yeah, please.

1602
02:07:59,640 --> 02:08:00,840
Why is there two of me?

1603
02:08:02,040 --> 02:08:03,320
Oh, one more moment.

1604
02:08:04,920 --> 02:08:05,960
Why not two of you?

1605
02:08:06,600 --> 02:08:08,520
There was two of me for a second on my stream.

1606
02:08:09,400 --> 02:08:12,280
What would Chai look like if she was white or Chinese?

1607
02:08:12,280 --> 02:08:13,400
Well, she's white now.

1608
02:08:16,520 --> 02:08:18,120
No, no, no, they think I'm brown.

1609
02:08:18,120 --> 02:08:18,760
Keep it up, keep it up.

1610
02:08:18,760 --> 02:08:19,400
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1611
02:08:19,400 --> 02:08:21,800
This is what you would look like if you were white or Chinese.

1612
02:08:22,520 --> 02:08:25,480
Yeah, I only hang out with streamers that fake the rig.

1613
02:08:26,520 --> 02:08:37,800
Yeah, we're all beautiful, Aryan queens, blue eyes, blonde hair, pale, pale skin.

1614
02:08:37,800 --> 02:08:40,200
Like you can see our veins.

1615
02:08:43,320 --> 02:08:47,160
I'm actually pretty light-skinned, but you can see my veins and I get made fun of.

1616
02:08:48,440 --> 02:08:51,800
Now, I turn over my arm and my veins are like very matte.

1617
02:08:51,800 --> 02:08:54,920
People are like, good veins, little lady, your veins are so good.

1618
02:08:56,280 --> 02:08:57,480
That's when they draw your blood.

1619
02:08:57,480 --> 02:08:58,760
Do you have blue veins?

1620
02:08:58,760 --> 02:08:59,560
I have green.

1621
02:08:59,560 --> 02:09:00,600
I got blue and green.

1622
02:09:01,480 --> 02:09:02,200
Yeah, I have green.

1623
02:09:02,200 --> 02:09:03,480
Oh, wow, we got a mixture.

1624
02:09:03,480 --> 02:09:04,920
Maybe it's because I'm white and black.

1625
02:09:06,040 --> 02:09:08,200
Wow, that's all you're talking about.

1626
02:09:08,200 --> 02:09:10,440
You're a race, race mixer.

1627
02:09:10,440 --> 02:09:11,720
I'm a race mixer.

1628
02:09:11,720 --> 02:09:19,080
My parents, they, their loves surpassed race and segregation and they made me.

1629
02:09:20,760 --> 02:09:22,120
Disgusting, you're an abominant.

1630
02:09:23,720 --> 02:09:24,200
Oh, wait.

1631
02:09:24,200 --> 02:09:25,080
You're an abominant.

1632
02:09:25,080 --> 02:09:28,760
I'm so sorry, Chai.

1633
02:09:28,760 --> 02:09:33,880
What would you guys, okay, in like a casual way, like, what would animal do you most associate?

1634
02:09:33,880 --> 02:09:35,160
What's your spirit animal?

1635
02:09:35,800 --> 02:09:37,640
Oh, my, my hamster.

1636
02:09:38,360 --> 02:09:39,400
Hamster?

1637
02:09:39,400 --> 02:09:44,040
Yeah, because I think, I think hamsters die in the most obscure way.

1638
02:09:44,040 --> 02:09:48,600
So I feel like my owner would throw me at a wall and I would just go splat and like crumble and die.

1639
02:09:49,800 --> 02:09:52,040
I'd be like a pathetic excuse of a hamster.

1640
02:09:52,040 --> 02:09:53,160
I wouldn't be able to do anything.

1641
02:09:53,800 --> 02:09:55,400
So that's why it's your spirit animal.

1642
02:09:55,400 --> 02:09:56,760
Because they're pathetic.

1643
02:09:56,760 --> 02:09:57,560
Yeah, just like me.

1644
02:10:00,840 --> 02:10:01,720
What are you guys?

1645
02:10:01,720 --> 02:10:02,680
What are you guys guys?

1646
02:10:02,680 --> 02:10:04,280
I don't know what the fuck I was saying.

1647
02:10:05,720 --> 02:10:07,000
I'm just laughing too much.

1648
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:08,200
I can't even answer.

1649
02:10:11,320 --> 02:10:13,240
Chibi thought she was the one who was edgy.

1650
02:10:13,240 --> 02:10:16,600
No, I know the moment I had, I was going to have Noria in my stream,

1651
02:10:16,600 --> 02:10:19,880
that you guys are going to fucking love her because how face she is.

1652
02:10:19,880 --> 02:10:23,240
And that's a great juxtaposition to Chai, who is so sweet.

1653
02:10:28,680 --> 02:10:31,800
You would think she'd be edgy with how she looks, but it's the pink one.

1654
02:10:31,800 --> 02:10:33,480
It's always the fucking pink one, isn't it?

1655
02:10:34,280 --> 02:10:35,880
It's always the fucking pink one.

1656
02:10:35,880 --> 02:10:37,560
It's always the fucking the pink woman.

1657
02:10:38,760 --> 02:10:40,280
Well, you're a purple woman.

1658
02:10:40,280 --> 02:10:41,960
I'm glad if you do.

1659
02:10:41,960 --> 02:10:42,520
Yeah.

1660
02:10:42,520 --> 02:10:43,160
No, I don't know.

1661
02:10:43,160 --> 02:10:44,120
I just think about it a lot.

1662
02:10:44,120 --> 02:10:46,760
Like if I was like, if I was a hamster, I would genuinely

1663
02:10:47,320 --> 02:10:48,440
I would genuinely die.

1664
02:10:48,440 --> 02:10:48,840
I don't know.

1665
02:10:48,840 --> 02:10:51,480
My owner would be too loud and I would just have a hard time.

1666
02:10:51,480 --> 02:10:52,120
I would just die.

1667
02:10:52,120 --> 02:10:56,120
My owner would bring a girl home and I'd kill myself like in my little cage or something.

1668
02:10:56,120 --> 02:10:56,440
I don't know.

1669
02:10:56,440 --> 02:10:56,920
Like I.

1670
02:10:56,920 --> 02:10:57,560
What?

1671
02:10:57,560 --> 02:10:59,000
What about you guys?

1672
02:10:59,000 --> 02:10:59,480
Dude?

1673
02:10:59,480 --> 02:11:00,040
Yeah, she knows this.

1674
02:11:00,040 --> 02:11:01,160
I want to pretend it.

1675
02:11:01,160 --> 02:11:09,480
I think on all levels, except physical, I'd be a wolf.

1676
02:11:09,480 --> 02:11:11,480
What?

1677
02:11:11,480 --> 02:11:13,320
I'm fucking a wolf.

1678
02:11:14,280 --> 02:11:17,720
I was a fucking role player for like 10 years.

1679
02:11:17,720 --> 02:11:18,680
I can't.

1680
02:11:18,680 --> 02:11:19,800
Wait, wait, yes.

1681
02:11:19,800 --> 02:11:20,520
I can't do that.

1682
02:11:20,520 --> 02:11:21,640
Yes, yes, yes.

1683
02:11:21,640 --> 02:11:24,840
Wait, I was a warrior cat's role player for so long.

1684
02:11:24,840 --> 02:11:25,880
Oh my god, no way.

1685
02:11:26,760 --> 02:11:27,240
Yes.

1686
02:11:27,240 --> 02:11:29,880
See, let's let it go.

1687
02:11:33,400 --> 02:11:34,840
Oh my gosh.

1688
02:11:34,840 --> 02:11:36,040
Can we start our own clan?

1689
02:11:36,760 --> 02:11:37,240
Yes.

1690
02:11:38,040 --> 02:11:40,680
I want to be Chai Pa or Chai Leaf.

1691
02:11:40,680 --> 02:11:41,560
I'm going to call you Chai Leaf.

1692
02:11:41,560 --> 02:11:42,680
That's actually really cute.

1693
02:11:43,640 --> 02:11:46,520
I guess I would be like cotton pick.

1694
02:11:46,520 --> 02:11:47,560
No, sorry.

1695
02:11:51,080 --> 02:11:52,680
I'll be cotton, cotton.

1696
02:11:53,880 --> 02:11:55,480
It's a perfect name for you.

1697
02:11:55,480 --> 02:11:56,040
Cotton bum.

1698
02:11:56,040 --> 02:11:56,840
Cotton bum.

1699
02:11:57,480 --> 02:12:00,120
Yeah, you just literally wouldn't have a furring.

1700
02:12:02,520 --> 02:12:05,480
What would my warrior cat name be?

1701
02:12:06,280 --> 02:12:06,680
I don't know.

1702
02:12:06,680 --> 02:12:09,720
Because when I was a kid, we role played like Naruto.

1703
02:12:09,720 --> 02:12:10,360
So I was like.

1704
02:12:10,360 --> 02:12:11,560
I also did that.

1705
02:12:11,560 --> 02:12:13,240
I also larped, you know, Naruto.

1706
02:12:13,240 --> 02:12:15,800
Yeah, I've larped enemies like a fucking loser.

1707
02:12:15,800 --> 02:12:17,720
Why does everyone have a membership?

1708
02:12:17,720 --> 02:12:19,080
Because they want to support me.

1709
02:12:19,640 --> 02:12:19,880
The.

1710
02:12:20,840 --> 02:12:21,080
Yeah.

1711
02:12:21,080 --> 02:12:21,800
Get out of here.

1712
02:12:21,800 --> 02:12:22,440
Gray name.

1713
02:12:23,880 --> 02:12:27,240
Yeah, leave my leave my leave my mommy alone.

1714
02:12:30,600 --> 02:12:31,320
Thank you for that.

1715
02:12:34,200 --> 02:12:36,680
You leave my you leave my mommy alone.

1716
02:12:36,680 --> 02:12:37,720
I love my mommy.

1717
02:12:38,760 --> 02:12:40,440
My sweet precious children.

1718
02:12:42,200 --> 02:12:44,040
Wait, so would you be a cat then, Chai?

1719
02:12:45,800 --> 02:12:51,000
Honestly, I think I always thought honestly.

1720
02:12:51,960 --> 02:12:52,520
I don't know.

1721
02:12:52,520 --> 02:12:53,640
I think I'd be a bunny.

1722
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:55,800
Oh my gosh.

1723
02:12:55,800 --> 02:12:56,680
No way.

1724
02:12:56,680 --> 02:12:57,960
Be a bunny.

1725
02:12:57,960 --> 02:13:00,120
Yeah, I actually do think so.

1726
02:13:00,120 --> 02:13:01,880
I think I think a bunny.

1727
02:13:01,880 --> 02:13:02,840
That's cute.

1728
02:13:02,840 --> 02:13:04,840
You kind of almost have like floppy ears,

1729
02:13:04,840 --> 02:13:06,920
like like mine with your pigtails.

1730
02:13:06,920 --> 02:13:07,800
Yeah, too.

1731
02:13:07,800 --> 02:13:08,760
The floppy.

1732
02:13:08,760 --> 02:13:10,120
Because your hair is super long.

1733
02:13:11,080 --> 02:13:13,160
We're actually, I'm looking at us.

1734
02:13:13,160 --> 02:13:16,280
We're very similar, similar color palette.

1735
02:13:16,280 --> 02:13:17,880
Looks like a flat version of you.

1736
02:13:20,040 --> 02:13:22,120
My hair is just a little bit more blonder.

1737
02:13:23,080 --> 02:13:26,520
And I'm just going to canonically adopt you

1738
02:13:26,520 --> 02:13:31,960
and say that I slept with harem, a demonic harem.

1739
02:13:32,600 --> 02:13:33,880
Yeah, demonic harem.

1740
02:13:33,880 --> 02:13:35,000
That's why you have horns.

1741
02:13:35,800 --> 02:13:38,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, mommy.

1742
02:13:39,160 --> 02:13:40,520
We're going to adopt you.

1743
02:13:40,520 --> 02:13:41,560
Flap is justice.

1744
02:13:41,560 --> 02:13:45,720
Speaking of justice, we overlapped with their diffuse today.

1745
02:13:45,720 --> 02:13:47,400
I'll have to go back and watch the VODs.

1746
02:13:48,520 --> 02:13:49,080
We are cute.

1747
02:13:49,080 --> 02:13:51,480
I want to, I want to, I want to,

1748
02:13:51,480 --> 02:13:53,320
I want to be adopted with a hat.

1749
02:13:53,320 --> 02:13:55,640
You're my pet, you're my pet bug from the garden.

1750
02:13:55,640 --> 02:13:56,760
Remember, I keep you in my palm.

1751
02:13:56,760 --> 02:13:57,560
From the garbage.

1752
02:13:58,520 --> 02:13:59,240
From the garbage.

1753
02:13:59,240 --> 02:13:59,800
From the garbage.

1754
02:14:00,520 --> 02:14:02,520
This, this pocket has a lot of lint

1755
02:14:02,520 --> 02:14:04,840
and like those cool little crumbs in it.

1756
02:14:04,840 --> 02:14:05,320
And that's okay.

1757
02:14:05,320 --> 02:14:06,520
Some moss and stuff.

1758
02:14:06,520 --> 02:14:07,080
It's okay.

1759
02:14:07,160 --> 02:14:11,480
You can crawl around and ride between my boobies and stuff.

1760
02:14:11,480 --> 02:14:13,400
I did that during your debut, by the way.

1761
02:14:14,200 --> 02:14:15,160
Yours and Azura's.

1762
02:14:15,160 --> 02:14:16,040
I sat on your top.

1763
02:14:16,040 --> 02:14:17,960
I think I actually saw that in the, uh,

1764
02:14:18,600 --> 02:14:20,280
when I watched your VOD back.

1765
02:14:20,280 --> 02:14:20,840
That's right.

1766
02:14:21,720 --> 02:14:23,080
I heard Azura's voice.

1767
02:14:23,080 --> 02:14:24,120
I'm so sorry.

1768
02:14:24,120 --> 02:14:24,840
She's not here.

1769
02:14:24,840 --> 02:14:25,560
Thank God.

1770
02:14:25,560 --> 02:14:27,560
I heard Azura's voice and good lord.

1771
02:14:27,560 --> 02:14:29,960
If I, if I was a man, if I was a man,

1772
02:14:30,680 --> 02:14:31,880
I'm telling you the things I would do,

1773
02:14:31,880 --> 02:14:33,000
I would do for that woman.

1774
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:33,560
Oh, wow.

1775
02:14:33,560 --> 02:14:35,560
She does have like, when I first heard her voice,

1776
02:14:35,560 --> 02:14:38,040
I almost, I almost died and went to heaven

1777
02:14:38,040 --> 02:14:39,560
because it's just pure sex.

1778
02:14:40,200 --> 02:14:42,440
I wanted to lift those things up and just

1779
02:14:42,440 --> 02:14:43,640
look at the sweat between them.

1780
02:14:43,640 --> 02:14:44,200
I don't know, man.

1781
02:14:44,200 --> 02:14:45,960
And she just, she just makes me a different person

1782
02:14:45,960 --> 02:14:46,600
thinking about her.

1783
02:14:48,600 --> 02:14:49,720
I want a voice like that.

1784
02:14:50,600 --> 02:14:50,920
Right.

1785
02:14:50,920 --> 02:14:53,080
Like she's, I don't know, man.

1786
02:14:53,080 --> 02:14:55,240
She was cooler, whatever, but Azura.

1787
02:14:57,640 --> 02:14:58,040
That's true.

1788
02:14:58,040 --> 02:14:59,640
I can't really compete with her voice.

1789
02:15:00,200 --> 02:15:00,760
Oh, sure.

1790
02:15:00,760 --> 02:15:02,120
But her voice surpasses.

1791
02:15:02,600 --> 02:15:05,320
Now, but you're, but you're, but you're my Oshi.

1792
02:15:05,880 --> 02:15:07,080
I'm your Oshi?

1793
02:15:07,800 --> 02:15:08,840
Yeah, you're my Oshi.

1794
02:15:08,840 --> 02:15:09,960
You're fucking lying.

1795
02:15:09,960 --> 02:15:10,760
Don't say that.

1796
02:15:11,480 --> 02:15:13,240
Oh, I'm going to cry.

1797
02:15:13,240 --> 02:15:15,080
Toma told me the same thing and I'm,

1798
02:15:15,080 --> 02:15:16,280
I'm literally going to lose it.

1799
02:15:16,280 --> 02:15:17,800
I'm going to cry into my pillow because they

1800
02:15:17,800 --> 02:15:19,560
don't deserve anybody's love.

1801
02:15:19,560 --> 02:15:19,880
Yep.

1802
02:15:21,480 --> 02:15:22,200
Yeah, you're right.

1803
02:15:24,200 --> 02:15:24,920
Who's who?

1804
02:15:25,560 --> 02:15:27,720
The really white one either we go.

1805
02:15:28,280 --> 02:15:31,080
And the beautiful, sexy blonde here,

1806
02:15:31,080 --> 02:15:31,880
devil girl.

1807
02:15:31,880 --> 02:15:32,920
I'm really cute.

1808
02:15:32,920 --> 02:15:33,400
Devil boy.

1809
02:15:33,400 --> 02:15:34,600
Here's his tie.

1810
02:15:35,720 --> 02:15:36,680
Sexy.

1811
02:15:36,680 --> 02:15:37,800
I got sexy.

1812
02:15:37,800 --> 02:15:39,160
She's a sexy little thing.

1813
02:15:40,280 --> 02:15:42,440
My sexy, my sexy daughter.

1814
02:15:43,560 --> 02:15:43,880
Whoa.

1815
02:15:43,880 --> 02:15:44,520
Yeah.

1816
02:15:44,520 --> 02:15:46,040
And the pet bug, I guess.

1817
02:15:47,480 --> 02:15:49,480
And my, um, garbage.

1818
02:15:52,600 --> 02:15:53,240
No, that's worse.

1819
02:15:53,240 --> 02:15:55,880
I prefer, I prefer, uh, she's just my little,

1820
02:15:55,880 --> 02:15:56,840
my little buggy daughter.

1821
02:15:57,320 --> 02:16:00,120
Um, no, the vaude is not getting nuked.

1822
02:16:01,080 --> 02:16:02,280
The vaude is not getting nuked.

1823
02:16:02,280 --> 02:16:02,840
Woo!

1824
02:16:02,840 --> 02:16:03,960
The first one!

1825
02:16:03,960 --> 02:16:05,240
First one you can keep up.

1826
02:16:08,440 --> 02:16:10,200
Wait, do you have to nuked vods?

1827
02:16:10,200 --> 02:16:14,200
I, I usually have to like cut or edit vods

1828
02:16:14,200 --> 02:16:16,120
or delete them completely because I will

1829
02:16:16,120 --> 02:16:17,720
just say really dumb shit that I'm not

1830
02:16:17,720 --> 02:16:19,080
supposed to say on YouTube.

1831
02:16:19,960 --> 02:16:22,680
But I say even more worse shit than I did on Twitch.

1832
02:16:24,840 --> 02:16:25,960
The price you pay.

1833
02:16:25,960 --> 02:16:27,160
I don't even know why.

1834
02:16:28,440 --> 02:16:29,000
Okay.

1835
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:29,720
I didn't know that.

1836
02:16:31,720 --> 02:16:32,040
Yeah.

1837
02:16:32,040 --> 02:16:34,040
You should watch, uh, honestly,

1838
02:16:34,040 --> 02:16:35,720
Nori, you should play Class of 09.

1839
02:16:35,720 --> 02:16:36,760
I know you'd like that game.

1840
02:16:38,200 --> 02:16:41,080
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a visual novel elitist,

1841
02:16:41,080 --> 02:16:42,680
so I don't play anything that gets like

1842
02:16:43,400 --> 02:16:44,840
touched by normies, I guess.

1843
02:16:44,840 --> 02:16:46,280
Like once it's in a normie scene, I'm like,

1844
02:16:46,280 --> 02:16:48,920
I definitely don't think it's a normie game.

1845
02:16:49,480 --> 02:16:50,520
I don't think it's a normie game.

1846
02:16:50,520 --> 02:16:51,960
I, I, I've seen it.

1847
02:16:51,960 --> 02:16:52,920
I like visual novels.

1848
02:16:52,920 --> 02:16:54,200
Maybe I'll play it one day.

1849
02:16:54,200 --> 02:16:54,520
Yeah.

1850
02:16:54,520 --> 02:16:55,320
I highly, I think you're-

1851
02:16:55,320 --> 02:16:57,560
I feel like if I play it, I start crying.

1852
02:16:57,560 --> 02:16:57,800
Yeah.

1853
02:16:58,760 --> 02:17:01,240
I would like to see the both of you play it,

1854
02:17:01,240 --> 02:17:03,960
or maybe we'll do a collab where you, we go through,

1855
02:17:04,840 --> 02:17:07,080
we go through, uh, the visual novel

1856
02:17:07,080 --> 02:17:08,120
and just commentate on it.

1857
02:17:08,120 --> 02:17:08,760
That would be funny.

1858
02:17:09,880 --> 02:17:11,080
You would love that.

1859
02:17:11,960 --> 02:17:13,000
What's an Oshi again?

1860
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:15,160
An Oshi is like, it's, okay,

1861
02:17:15,160 --> 02:17:18,520
it's like a huge dork for people that are new TV to be.

1862
02:17:18,520 --> 02:17:20,120
It is idol culture thingy.

1863
02:17:20,120 --> 02:17:22,440
So you have like, kind of like in K-pop,

1864
02:17:22,440 --> 02:17:23,320
you have a bias.

1865
02:17:23,320 --> 02:17:26,120
It's like one person in like maybe a group

1866
02:17:26,200 --> 02:17:28,680
or like an individual that you really, really enjoy

1867
02:17:29,400 --> 02:17:31,560
and you are constantly keeping like up with.

1868
02:17:32,280 --> 02:17:35,400
So like, my Oshi would be Chibi.

1869
02:17:35,400 --> 02:17:36,040
You know what I mean?

1870
02:17:38,600 --> 02:17:39,880
Like, I keep up with Chibi,

1871
02:17:39,880 --> 02:17:42,600
but my Kami Oshi is like, Ina.

1872
02:17:43,480 --> 02:17:44,760
I have so much Ina merch.

1873
02:17:44,760 --> 02:17:45,160
It's so bad.

1874
02:17:45,160 --> 02:17:46,680
I made for Chibi to make merch.

1875
02:17:46,680 --> 02:17:49,720
I didn't know that, uh, your, your Kami Oshi was Ina.

1876
02:17:49,720 --> 02:17:50,840
That's actually cute.

1877
02:17:50,840 --> 02:17:51,480
I do have-

1878
02:17:51,480 --> 02:17:53,160
Make myself purple for like,

1879
02:17:53,720 --> 02:17:56,120
every Vtuber that I've liked so far is purple.

1880
02:17:56,120 --> 02:17:57,880
So I just make myself purple.

1881
02:17:57,880 --> 02:17:59,560
Now that I really think about it.

1882
02:17:59,560 --> 02:18:00,920
All my favorite Vtubers are purple.

1883
02:18:00,920 --> 02:18:03,400
You're the only red Vtuber that I like.

1884
02:18:03,400 --> 02:18:04,680
I was supposed to be purple.

1885
02:18:04,680 --> 02:18:05,960
Look! I'm leaving!

1886
02:18:05,960 --> 02:18:07,480
I'm leaving!

1887
02:18:07,480 --> 02:18:08,520
You're my, there's, wait,

1888
02:18:08,520 --> 02:18:09,720
but Ty, you're my friend.

1889
02:18:11,240 --> 02:18:12,920
And Oshi will never notice me.

1890
02:18:12,920 --> 02:18:14,280
You're the only red Vtuber.

1891
02:18:14,280 --> 02:18:14,920
You're in-

1892
02:18:14,920 --> 02:18:15,880
Oh!

1893
02:18:15,880 --> 02:18:17,080
I meant my Oshi's.

1894
02:18:17,080 --> 02:18:18,120
I meant my Oshi's.

1895
02:18:18,120 --> 02:18:19,000
I meant my Oshi's.

1896
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:19,800
He's sitting there.

1897
02:18:19,800 --> 02:18:21,080
Oh, okay, okay.

1898
02:18:21,080 --> 02:18:22,840
She's like, I like you.

1899
02:18:23,320 --> 02:18:25,320
Um, but yes, I do have merch since you mentioned that.

1900
02:18:25,320 --> 02:18:26,760
My merch is in my description.

1901
02:18:27,400 --> 02:18:27,880
A wink.

1902
02:18:30,200 --> 02:18:31,720
You can get your own, own a hole.

1903
02:18:31,720 --> 02:18:32,200
I'm kidding.

1904
02:18:32,200 --> 02:18:32,840
That's not true.

1905
02:18:32,840 --> 02:18:33,160
What?

1906
02:18:33,160 --> 02:18:33,480
You know-

1907
02:18:33,480 --> 02:18:33,800
No!

1908
02:18:35,080 --> 02:18:37,000
I actually, I might, I might buy it.

1909
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:38,760
See, if you make my keychains and pins,

1910
02:18:38,760 --> 02:18:39,800
just ping me,

1911
02:18:39,800 --> 02:18:42,040
because I'll make a bag dedicated to you.

1912
02:18:42,040 --> 02:18:43,240
Aw, thank you.

1913
02:18:43,240 --> 02:18:44,040
That's really, very nice.

1914
02:18:44,040 --> 02:18:44,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1915
02:18:44,760 --> 02:18:46,840
I'm like a really big j-

1916
02:18:46,840 --> 02:18:49,000
like fucking, what is it?

1917
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:50,360
I don't nerd.

1918
02:18:50,360 --> 02:18:51,400
Sort of this like,

1919
02:18:51,480 --> 02:18:53,160
I'm, I'm sorry if I'm rambling.

1920
02:18:53,160 --> 02:18:53,640
I know.

1921
02:18:53,640 --> 02:18:56,360
Um, it's really, it's really cute when people have like bags,

1922
02:18:56,360 --> 02:18:57,160
like eat a bag.

1923
02:18:57,160 --> 02:19:00,040
So there's like a thing where it's literally the same merch

1924
02:19:00,040 --> 02:19:01,240
and one bag.

1925
02:19:01,240 --> 02:19:01,960
I didn't know that was-

1926
02:19:01,960 --> 02:19:03,000
I forgot what they're called.

1927
02:19:03,640 --> 02:19:04,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1928
02:19:04,920 --> 02:19:05,960
So if you do that, let me know.

1929
02:19:05,960 --> 02:19:07,000
I have three for Ena.

1930
02:19:08,600 --> 02:19:09,400
That's really cute.

1931
02:19:09,400 --> 02:19:10,520
I didn't know that, Nori.

1932
02:19:10,520 --> 02:19:11,560
That's so adorable.

1933
02:19:12,120 --> 02:19:13,240
Hey, you just, yeah, this is just,

1934
02:19:13,240 --> 02:19:13,640
let me know.

1935
02:19:13,640 --> 02:19:15,480
I'm like, I like, I like pins and keychains.

1936
02:19:15,480 --> 02:19:18,440
Pick you up and smush you against my bosom.

1937
02:19:18,440 --> 02:19:19,880
You're so fucking adorable.

1938
02:19:20,840 --> 02:19:22,440
I would genuinely love that.

1939
02:19:22,440 --> 02:19:24,360
If you start feeling biting, ignore that.

1940
02:19:27,800 --> 02:19:28,120
Oh.

1941
02:19:28,120 --> 02:19:29,640
Don't say Ona Oshihou.

1942
02:19:29,640 --> 02:19:30,760
That's disgusting.

1943
02:19:31,400 --> 02:19:33,240
This is a safer work chat.

1944
02:19:33,240 --> 02:19:34,120
You hear that?

1945
02:19:34,120 --> 02:19:37,560
I may be screaming with a woman that does-

1946
02:19:43,080 --> 02:19:44,760
I might be a woman of the night,

1947
02:19:44,760 --> 02:19:46,200
but the other girls are not.

1948
02:19:46,200 --> 02:19:47,800
They don't do the sort of content I do.

1949
02:19:47,800 --> 02:19:50,760
So please do not think or assume or give them,

1950
02:19:50,760 --> 02:19:52,680
like, or sexually harass them or anything

1951
02:19:52,680 --> 02:19:54,520
because they don't make that content.

1952
02:19:54,520 --> 02:19:57,880
They're just, you're, you know, sweet, say-so.

1953
02:20:00,360 --> 02:20:00,840
In some ways.

1954
02:20:00,840 --> 02:20:01,480
Oh, yeah?

1955
02:20:01,480 --> 02:20:01,960
Yeah.

1956
02:20:01,960 --> 02:20:02,520
Yeah.

1957
02:20:02,520 --> 02:20:05,080
Oh, you're talking about us.

1958
02:20:05,080 --> 02:20:06,040
You're talking about us.

1959
02:20:06,600 --> 02:20:07,720
Oh, yeah.

1960
02:20:07,720 --> 02:20:08,920
I'm just edgy, ma'am.

1961
02:20:08,920 --> 02:20:09,880
What's the difference?

1962
02:20:09,880 --> 02:20:10,280
I don't know.

1963
02:20:11,320 --> 02:20:14,440
Once you get into the private chat in my Discord,

1964
02:20:14,440 --> 02:20:15,560
it's a little crazy.

1965
02:20:15,560 --> 02:20:15,880
Is it girl-central?

1966
02:20:15,880 --> 02:20:17,960
Once you get into VC with me, it's bad.

1967
02:20:17,960 --> 02:20:18,840
Groom!

1968
02:20:19,480 --> 02:20:21,160
Are you getting groomed by your moths?

1969
02:20:23,160 --> 02:20:25,080
No, you have to do the grooming yourself.

1970
02:20:25,080 --> 02:20:27,080
Honestly, Chai-Chai would do the grooming.

1971
02:20:27,080 --> 02:20:28,360
She just, like, she comes off as like,

1972
02:20:28,360 --> 02:20:29,640
I'm so sweet and innocent,

1973
02:20:29,640 --> 02:20:32,360
and then she'll just fucking groom the fuck out of you.

1974
02:20:33,960 --> 02:20:34,920
I'd be okay with that.

1975
02:20:35,880 --> 02:20:36,200
Same.

1976
02:20:36,200 --> 02:20:36,760
I'm here.

1977
02:20:36,760 --> 02:20:37,560
I'd be okay.

1978
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:40,040
I don't know what I should say.

1979
02:20:40,040 --> 02:20:40,600
All right, Chai-Chai.

1980
02:20:41,400 --> 02:20:41,880
Uh-uh.

1981
02:20:42,840 --> 02:20:43,960
Let me, uh, look at the-

1982
02:20:43,960 --> 02:20:44,440
Oh, no.

1983
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:45,480
Oh, my God.

1984
02:20:45,480 --> 02:20:46,200
And say thank you.

1985
02:20:46,200 --> 02:20:47,000
I feel kind of bad,

1986
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:48,840
because I feel like I rumble a lot.

1987
02:20:48,840 --> 02:20:49,400
Oh, Chai-Chai.

1988
02:20:49,400 --> 02:20:50,120
You're fine.

1989
02:20:50,120 --> 02:20:51,240
I feel the same thing.

1990
02:20:51,240 --> 02:20:52,200
My-my chat knows-

1991
02:20:52,200 --> 02:20:53,560
Chai-Chai, this is our podcast.

1992
02:20:53,560 --> 02:20:54,680
You can say whatever you want.

1993
02:20:55,240 --> 02:20:57,320
My chat knows how much I app, so they-

1994
02:20:57,320 --> 02:20:57,880
They-

1995
02:20:57,880 --> 02:20:58,920
I guess.

1996
02:20:58,920 --> 02:21:00,600
Love you and Chai for the same reason.

1997
02:21:00,600 --> 02:21:02,040
Why do you act like I don't watch your streams?

1998
02:21:02,040 --> 02:21:02,760
Woman, I'm there.

1999
02:21:02,760 --> 02:21:03,320
I know that.

2000
02:21:03,320 --> 02:21:03,880
I'm there.

2001
02:21:03,880 --> 02:21:04,440
What do you mean?

2002
02:21:04,440 --> 02:21:05,960
I haven't seen your name!

2003
02:21:05,960 --> 02:21:06,440
Are you lurking?

2004
02:21:06,440 --> 02:21:07,400
Oh, I just look type.

2005
02:21:07,960 --> 02:21:08,440
God.

2006
02:21:08,440 --> 02:21:08,920
Okay.

2007
02:21:08,920 --> 02:21:09,640
Because I want to-

2008
02:21:09,640 --> 02:21:10,120
I get-

2009
02:21:10,120 --> 02:21:12,120
I get scared when people notice me.

2010
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:13,400
I don't-

2011
02:21:13,400 --> 02:21:14,760
Actually, I feel the same way, so-

2012
02:21:14,760 --> 02:21:16,360
Okay, I'll never notice you ever.

2013
02:21:16,360 --> 02:21:17,800
I'll never perceive you.

2014
02:21:17,800 --> 02:21:18,360
No!

2015
02:21:18,360 --> 02:21:19,800
It's like, I don't want to explain it,

2016
02:21:19,800 --> 02:21:22,520
because then sometimes their chat starts talking to you,

2017
02:21:22,520 --> 02:21:22,840
and you're like,

2018
02:21:22,840 --> 02:21:24,040
oh, my God, please don't.

2019
02:21:24,040 --> 02:21:25,240
Please, I want to pee everywhere.

2020
02:21:25,240 --> 02:21:25,960
Don't do this.

2021
02:21:25,960 --> 02:21:27,400
You're gonna pee everywhere?

2022
02:21:27,400 --> 02:21:28,680
Yeah, I know what you mean.

2023
02:21:28,680 --> 02:21:29,480
Sometimes when you-

2024
02:21:29,480 --> 02:21:30,120
It's like, it's-

2025
02:21:30,120 --> 02:21:31,800
It's exciting when you talk in a French chat,

2026
02:21:31,800 --> 02:21:32,280
because then you're like,

2027
02:21:32,280 --> 02:21:33,240
oh, my God, hi!

2028
02:21:33,240 --> 02:21:34,840
But then you're like, oh, no, I'm like,

2029
02:21:34,840 --> 02:21:35,400
I don't know.

2030
02:21:35,400 --> 02:21:35,960
It's like-

2031
02:21:35,960 --> 02:21:37,640
Because like, you're taking away a pension from-

2032
02:21:37,640 --> 02:21:38,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, right?

2033
02:21:38,440 --> 02:21:39,320
This was really bad.

2034
02:21:39,320 --> 02:21:41,720
I felt like, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah.

2035
02:21:41,720 --> 02:21:44,040
That's why I usually only say one or two things,

2036
02:21:44,040 --> 02:21:45,640
because I don't-

2037
02:21:45,640 --> 02:21:47,240
Like, especially with my gen mates,

2038
02:21:47,240 --> 02:21:51,080
because sometimes people move the chat's focus on me.

2039
02:21:51,080 --> 02:21:52,600
So I'm just like, I'll say hi,

2040
02:21:52,600 --> 02:21:53,480
and then I'll be like-

2041
02:21:53,480 --> 02:21:54,280
Yeah, quiet.

2042
02:21:54,280 --> 02:21:54,600
Quiet.

2043
02:21:54,600 --> 02:21:55,160
Yeah.

2044
02:21:55,160 --> 02:21:55,640
Yeah.

2045
02:21:55,640 --> 02:21:57,080
You're gonna be like, yeah.

2046
02:21:57,080 --> 02:21:57,720
What?

2047
02:21:57,720 --> 02:21:58,920
Were you just underwater?

2048
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:02,040
Oh, it's hilarious.

2049
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:04,760
Someone in my mic panel kills itself.

2050
02:22:04,760 --> 02:22:05,320
Oh, so I just noticed-

2051
02:22:05,320 --> 02:22:06,920
Can you guys hold your arms?

2052
02:22:06,920 --> 02:22:08,120
Yeah, I'm Hispanic.

2053
02:22:08,200 --> 02:22:08,680
Try.

2054
02:22:09,880 --> 02:22:10,360
Sorry.

2055
02:22:11,560 --> 02:22:13,160
I'm so sorry you're Hispanic.

2056
02:22:14,200 --> 02:22:15,160
Yeah, my bad.

2057
02:22:15,160 --> 02:22:16,120
I'm sorry, guys.

2058
02:22:16,120 --> 02:22:16,360
I am-

2059
02:22:17,560 --> 02:22:18,280
I'm sorry.

2060
02:22:18,280 --> 02:22:18,760
I know.

2061
02:22:18,760 --> 02:22:19,240
I know.

2062
02:22:19,960 --> 02:22:21,320
I'm gonna hold the box and see.

2063
02:22:21,320 --> 02:22:22,840
Ha-ra, ha-ra, ha-ra.

2064
02:22:22,840 --> 02:22:23,400
Ha-ra.

2065
02:22:23,400 --> 02:22:23,800
Rrrr.

2066
02:22:24,680 --> 02:22:26,200
Ha-ra, ha-ra-ee-ba.

2067
02:22:26,200 --> 02:22:27,080
Ha-ra-ee-ba.

2068
02:22:27,080 --> 02:22:28,280
I want to learn how to purr.

2069
02:22:28,280 --> 02:22:28,760
Rrr.

2070
02:22:28,760 --> 02:22:29,320
Rrr.

2071
02:22:29,320 --> 02:22:30,040
Rrr.

2072
02:22:30,040 --> 02:22:30,600
Rrr.

2073
02:22:30,600 --> 02:22:31,320
Rrr.

2074
02:22:31,320 --> 02:22:31,640
Rrr.

2075
02:22:31,640 --> 02:22:32,440
Rrr.

2076
02:22:32,440 --> 02:22:32,920
Rrr.

2077
02:22:32,920 --> 02:22:33,400
Rrr.

2078
02:22:33,400 --> 02:22:33,960
Rrr.

2079
02:22:33,960 --> 02:22:34,600
Rrr.

2080
02:22:34,600 --> 02:22:35,160
Rrr.

2081
02:22:35,160 --> 02:22:36,200
It's the favorite word.

2082
02:22:36,200 --> 02:22:36,840
Rrr.

2083
02:22:36,840 --> 02:22:37,160
OK.

2084
02:22:37,160 --> 02:22:37,640
Hold on.

2085
02:22:37,640 --> 02:22:40,020
I'm gonna definitely say thank yous for Dota's and shit.

2086
02:22:40,020 --> 02:22:40,860
I'll be right back.

2087
02:22:40,860 --> 02:22:41,700
Okay, go do it.

2088
02:22:41,700 --> 02:22:42,540
Do it.

2089
02:22:45,260 --> 02:22:47,220
I love them so much there.

2090
02:22:47,220 --> 02:22:48,060
Oh my God.

2091
02:22:48,060 --> 02:22:50,500
I'm so thankful to have them as friends.

2092
02:22:50,500 --> 02:22:53,220
It's been a deep up too strong.

2093
02:22:53,220 --> 02:22:54,780
It's been a good present.

2094
02:22:55,780 --> 02:22:58,340
Yeah, that's what the conversation

2095
02:22:58,340 --> 02:22:59,740
will turn to with these two.

2096
02:23:01,820 --> 02:23:03,780
But thank you, Charlie.

2097
02:23:03,780 --> 02:23:04,700
She'd be pleased for giving me

2098
02:23:04,700 --> 02:23:07,260
from about to do bark, bark, bark, bark.

2099
02:23:07,260 --> 02:23:09,020
Thank you for the five bucks.

2100
02:23:09,020 --> 02:23:11,580
But thank you for the shibbity toilet.

2101
02:23:12,620 --> 02:23:13,820
Thank you for the tip, boy.

2102
02:23:13,820 --> 02:23:16,660
She'd be playing with her two daughters, so wholesome.

2103
02:23:16,660 --> 02:23:20,820
Thank you for the $20 two-tool, beep, beep, bless.

2104
02:23:20,820 --> 02:23:23,460
I haven't heard that in a long time.

2105
02:23:23,460 --> 02:23:24,340
Please let Nori know.

2106
02:23:24,340 --> 02:23:26,220
She has a whole paper set in her, your chat.

2107
02:23:26,220 --> 02:23:27,060
She can risen up.

2108
02:23:27,060 --> 02:23:28,700
Oh, she knows, she knows.

2109
02:23:28,700 --> 02:23:30,420
Thank you, Morgan.

2110
02:23:30,420 --> 02:23:31,580
But thank you guys.

2111
02:23:33,780 --> 02:23:36,540
I already know that you guys are having as much fun as me.

2112
02:23:36,540 --> 02:23:37,900
I don't even have to ask.

2113
02:23:37,900 --> 02:23:39,180
All right, watch, I'm an undefined

2114
02:23:39,180 --> 02:23:41,940
and they're probably me saying the most ridiculous shit.

2115
02:23:41,940 --> 02:23:44,380
It's like, oh, nice, happy, happy times.

2116
02:23:44,380 --> 02:23:47,020
That's exactly just how it feels sometimes.

2117
02:23:47,020 --> 02:23:49,340
Yeah, I had a nap.

2118
02:23:49,340 --> 02:23:50,340
I also had a nap.

2119
02:23:50,340 --> 02:23:52,980
I was scared I wasn't gonna wake up in time for the collab.

2120
02:23:52,980 --> 02:23:54,940
But I was genuinely like, if I sleep now,

2121
02:23:54,940 --> 02:23:57,140
I don't know if I'll wake up on time.

2122
02:23:57,140 --> 02:23:59,340
Yeah, I set an alarm.

2123
02:23:59,340 --> 02:24:01,460
I feel like, yeah, you know when you have those naps

2124
02:24:01,460 --> 02:24:03,460
where it's like you're, oh, home.

2125
02:24:03,460 --> 02:24:04,300
She back?

2126
02:24:04,300 --> 02:24:05,700
I went back.

2127
02:24:06,660 --> 02:24:08,740
I was just like, I was like listening to you guys talk.

2128
02:24:08,740 --> 02:24:09,700
Oh, cute.

2129
02:24:09,700 --> 02:24:10,700
To each other about her napping.

2130
02:24:10,700 --> 02:24:12,460
I'm talking about her napping.

2131
02:24:12,460 --> 02:24:15,220
I had really stressful dreams because like,

2132
02:24:15,220 --> 02:24:17,460
I feel like I went, I napped.

2133
02:24:17,460 --> 02:24:19,900
Like, I was like, okay, I have to like get up

2134
02:24:19,900 --> 02:24:20,900
after this stuff.

2135
02:24:20,900 --> 02:24:24,260
I have to, oh wait, raid, raid, raid.

2136
02:24:24,260 --> 02:24:25,220
Wait, oh my God, raid.

2137
02:24:25,220 --> 02:24:26,060
Hold on a second.

2138
02:24:27,140 --> 02:24:27,980
Oh, she's gone.

2139
02:24:27,980 --> 02:24:30,140
Thank you for the raid.

2140
02:24:30,140 --> 02:24:31,460
Thank you for the raid.

2141
02:24:31,460 --> 02:24:32,300
Oh my God.

2142
02:24:34,740 --> 02:24:35,660
Oh, she's muted.

2143
02:24:35,700 --> 02:24:36,540
What the fuck?

2144
02:24:36,540 --> 02:24:38,540
She's like, I disappeared.

2145
02:24:39,940 --> 02:24:41,780
She was shrimped.

2146
02:24:41,780 --> 02:24:43,260
What was it gonna say?

2147
02:24:43,260 --> 02:24:44,740
I take naps all the time.

2148
02:24:44,740 --> 02:24:46,460
I have a nap time schedule.

2149
02:24:46,460 --> 02:24:47,500
Like a pod board.

2150
02:24:47,500 --> 02:24:49,700
I've napped for like probably three hours today.

2151
02:24:49,700 --> 02:24:52,260
So that's why I don't know why I'm still so tired.

2152
02:24:52,260 --> 02:24:54,060
Yeah, I sleep at three or five.

2153
02:24:54,060 --> 02:24:57,140
No, in between, I'm just a child.

2154
02:24:57,140 --> 02:25:00,540
I know it's hard because I stream in my time slot

2155
02:25:00,540 --> 02:25:02,960
at the same time that I would normally nap.

2156
02:25:02,960 --> 02:25:04,660
So I have to nap earlier.

2157
02:25:04,660 --> 02:25:06,620
So then I sleep later or I nap later

2158
02:25:06,620 --> 02:25:08,740
and I sleep later and then I wake up at like 11.

2159
02:25:08,740 --> 02:25:10,500
I don't go to sleep until like five a.m.

2160
02:25:10,500 --> 02:25:13,980
and then I wake up at like 10 a.m., 10 p.m., 10 a.m.

2161
02:25:13,980 --> 02:25:14,940
all the time.

2162
02:25:16,660 --> 02:25:18,380
I have a horrible sleep schedule.

2163
02:25:18,380 --> 02:25:19,420
Don't nod.

2164
02:25:19,420 --> 02:25:21,260
I'm sorry, I've been yawning.

2165
02:25:21,260 --> 02:25:22,100
I'm yawning.

2166
02:25:22,100 --> 02:25:23,340
So I'm sorry.

2167
02:25:23,340 --> 02:25:24,180
Container.

2168
02:25:24,180 --> 02:25:25,020
You didn't go while you didn't go.

2169
02:25:25,020 --> 02:25:25,980
I'm boring or something.

2170
02:25:25,980 --> 02:25:28,260
No, I love you, stop.

2171
02:25:28,260 --> 02:25:29,980
Me, me, me, me.

2172
02:25:29,980 --> 02:25:32,980
Also, I'm so sorry, it's hair on my hair.

2173
02:25:32,980 --> 02:25:33,820
Yeah, hair on my hair.

2174
02:25:34,100 --> 02:25:34,940
Oh my God.

2175
02:25:34,940 --> 02:25:38,540
I made your, you're too much stream-solid.

2176
02:25:39,420 --> 02:25:41,580
It's the only time slot I'm available.

2177
02:25:42,860 --> 02:25:45,060
It's fine, they understand.

2178
02:25:45,060 --> 02:25:47,940
No, it's, you're guilty about it.

2179
02:25:47,940 --> 02:25:49,180
No, I don't feel guilty.

2180
02:25:49,180 --> 02:25:52,660
They're, I bet they believe that it was worth it

2181
02:25:52,660 --> 02:25:54,260
so they got to meet you and try.

2182
02:25:54,260 --> 02:25:55,100
So.

2183
02:25:55,100 --> 02:25:55,940
I hope so.

2184
02:25:55,940 --> 02:25:56,780
Yep.

2185
02:25:56,780 --> 02:25:57,780
I hope they liked it.

2186
02:25:57,780 --> 02:25:58,620
Yeah, I hope they did.

2187
02:25:58,620 --> 02:26:00,100
I'm just not, I'm gonna be all sad

2188
02:26:00,100 --> 02:26:01,940
when I lie being around you.

2189
02:26:01,940 --> 02:26:02,780
No.

2190
02:26:02,900 --> 02:26:03,900
Yes, I missed you.

2191
02:26:03,900 --> 02:26:04,740
I missed you a bunch.

2192
02:26:04,740 --> 02:26:05,580
All right.

2193
02:26:05,580 --> 02:26:06,420
No, you didn't miss me.

2194
02:26:06,420 --> 02:26:07,260
We just met.

2195
02:26:07,260 --> 02:26:08,100
We just met.

2196
02:26:08,100 --> 02:26:09,420
What am I talking about?

2197
02:26:09,420 --> 02:26:10,260
We just met.

2198
02:26:10,260 --> 02:26:11,580
We spent a little night.

2199
02:26:11,580 --> 02:26:13,420
You just met.

2200
02:26:13,420 --> 02:26:14,660
It's just the dreams.

2201
02:26:14,660 --> 02:26:16,100
You've just been in my dreams.

2202
02:26:16,100 --> 02:26:18,300
So it feels like we've known each other for months.

2203
02:26:18,300 --> 02:26:20,260
You've worked with me in my dreams.

2204
02:26:23,260 --> 02:26:24,860
What's happened to dreams, really?

2205
02:26:27,580 --> 02:26:28,500
I can tell you one of them.

2206
02:26:28,500 --> 02:26:29,900
I'm actually, I've had dreams.

2207
02:26:29,900 --> 02:26:31,980
It was weird though, cause he felt like,

2208
02:26:32,060 --> 02:26:33,580
you know, like you ever have like,

2209
02:26:33,580 --> 02:26:35,180
it's like we were an animic.

2210
02:26:35,180 --> 02:26:36,540
It was like in the real world.

2211
02:26:36,540 --> 02:26:38,500
So it was like you, but I was like a real person.

2212
02:26:38,500 --> 02:26:39,620
I don't know how to explain it.

2213
02:26:39,620 --> 02:26:41,860
Was I white or was I brown?

2214
02:26:41,860 --> 02:26:43,060
You were kind of tanned.

2215
02:26:43,060 --> 02:26:44,060
You were like tan.

2216
02:26:44,060 --> 02:26:44,900
Interesting.

2217
02:26:44,900 --> 02:26:45,740
You were like a tan.

2218
02:26:45,740 --> 02:26:46,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2219
02:26:46,580 --> 02:26:48,100
But, but there was like a weird dream

2220
02:26:48,100 --> 02:26:49,500
and we were just talking to me

2221
02:26:49,500 --> 02:26:50,620
and like you were holding my hand.

2222
02:26:50,620 --> 02:26:51,780
I was like, oh my God.

2223
02:26:52,700 --> 02:26:53,540
She's touching me.

2224
02:26:53,540 --> 02:26:54,380
Oh my God.

2225
02:26:54,380 --> 02:26:55,420
Yeah, like she's touching me.

2226
02:26:55,420 --> 02:26:56,620
She's touching my hands.

2227
02:26:56,620 --> 02:26:58,540
Oh my, oh my days.

2228
02:26:58,540 --> 02:26:59,900
Oh, good Lord.

2229
02:26:59,900 --> 02:27:01,460
Oh my days.

2230
02:27:01,460 --> 02:27:03,900
I would love to go to a convention with you.

2231
02:27:03,900 --> 02:27:05,300
That'd be fun.

2232
02:27:05,300 --> 02:27:10,140
There's, I am hopefully planning to go to one.

2233
02:27:11,140 --> 02:27:12,780
I don't think you are,

2234
02:27:12,780 --> 02:27:15,460
I don't think your place of work is very far

2235
02:27:15,460 --> 02:27:17,140
from my little, my little hole in the hole.

2236
02:27:17,140 --> 02:27:17,980
Hi!

2237
02:27:17,980 --> 02:27:19,020
Hi, Ty.

2238
02:27:19,020 --> 02:27:21,100
Oh, did you guys know that I quit my job?

2239
02:27:21,980 --> 02:27:22,980
Yeah, I saw that.

2240
02:27:22,980 --> 02:27:24,300
Yeah, I saw that.

2241
02:27:24,300 --> 02:27:26,900
So I can, I can probably just

2242
02:27:27,820 --> 02:27:32,620
chalk myself across the states and go to you.

2243
02:27:32,620 --> 02:27:34,780
Wait, we're meeting in person?

2244
02:27:34,780 --> 02:27:37,020
No, I mean, like we're just,

2245
02:27:37,020 --> 02:27:38,900
she was telling me she had a dream

2246
02:27:38,900 --> 02:27:40,460
that we went to a con together.

2247
02:27:40,460 --> 02:27:43,220
And I was like, oh, I love what we're talking.

2248
02:27:43,220 --> 02:27:45,940
Koreans grind, Koreans grind.

2249
02:27:45,940 --> 02:27:47,020
Thank you for the follow.

2250
02:27:47,020 --> 02:27:52,020
Oh, oh, I was like, oh, good about Korean's that grind.

2251
02:27:52,100 --> 02:27:53,060
Oh, I love Korean's.

2252
02:27:53,060 --> 02:27:55,020
Wait, Noriko, someone said more,

2253
02:27:55,020 --> 02:27:57,100
Noriko, more like stinky co.

2254
02:27:57,100 --> 02:27:58,420
I just thought you should know that.

2255
02:27:58,420 --> 02:27:59,540
I learned them.

2256
02:27:59,540 --> 02:28:00,380
Who said that?

2257
02:28:00,380 --> 02:28:01,220
Who said that?

2258
02:28:01,220 --> 02:28:02,060
Give me, give me.

2259
02:28:02,060 --> 02:28:02,900
Their names?

2260
02:28:02,900 --> 02:28:03,740
Self mechanic.

2261
02:28:03,740 --> 02:28:04,580
I was going to ban them,

2262
02:28:04,580 --> 02:28:05,420
but they're a certified tune,

2263
02:28:05,420 --> 02:28:06,820
but I don't think I should ban them.

2264
02:28:06,820 --> 02:28:08,420
No, you should just

2265
02:28:08,420 --> 02:28:10,700
flick them really hard in the forehead.

2266
02:28:10,700 --> 02:28:12,540
Why in the forehead?

2267
02:28:12,540 --> 02:28:13,700
Because that's where I remember my mom was.

2268
02:28:13,700 --> 02:28:15,260
Oh, you said flick them.

2269
02:28:15,260 --> 02:28:17,300
I've heard something else.

2270
02:28:17,300 --> 02:28:18,820
Yeah, you flick them in the forehead.

2271
02:28:18,820 --> 02:28:20,380
I thought you said fuck them in the forehead

2272
02:28:20,380 --> 02:28:23,100
and I was a little bit confused.

2273
02:28:23,100 --> 02:28:24,900
Oh, I guess from like the lobotomy.

2274
02:28:24,900 --> 02:28:26,380
Oh, yeah, there you go.

2275
02:28:26,380 --> 02:28:28,380
Well, that's kind of like the eye socket.

2276
02:28:29,460 --> 02:28:30,780
Doll spoon.

2277
02:28:30,780 --> 02:28:33,100
Oh, that's such silly little names, huh?

2278
02:28:34,100 --> 02:28:35,340
Okay, are we going to a con?

2279
02:28:35,340 --> 02:28:36,740
I want to go to a con with you guys.

2280
02:28:36,740 --> 02:28:38,020
Do you guys like the cosplay?

2281
02:28:38,020 --> 02:28:39,540
Do you guys like the cosplay?

2282
02:28:39,540 --> 02:28:40,380
I'm too.

2283
02:28:40,380 --> 02:28:41,780
I do like the cosplay.

2284
02:28:41,780 --> 02:28:43,500
I cosplayed myself.

2285
02:28:45,100 --> 02:28:46,420
They're so good.

2286
02:28:46,420 --> 02:28:48,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2287
02:28:48,260 --> 02:28:49,580
Huge boobies.

2288
02:28:50,820 --> 02:28:51,700
You have pictures.

2289
02:28:51,700 --> 02:28:53,300
I just noticed that one of you guys

2290
02:28:53,300 --> 02:28:55,100
sounds like Ruby Rose from Ruby.

2291
02:28:55,100 --> 02:28:56,380
Which one?

2292
02:28:56,380 --> 02:28:58,140
I don't think it's me.

2293
02:28:58,140 --> 02:28:58,980
Huh?

2294
02:28:58,980 --> 02:29:01,100
I get told I sound like Mabel in Peridot.

2295
02:29:02,060 --> 02:29:03,060
Oh, you do?

2296
02:29:03,060 --> 02:29:04,820
Oh, that's actually true.

2297
02:29:04,820 --> 02:29:05,940
Oh my God, that's so true.

2298
02:29:05,940 --> 02:29:07,260
You sound like Peridot.

2299
02:29:07,260 --> 02:29:08,580
That's so real.

2300
02:29:08,580 --> 02:29:10,700
I know, I get to sound like Peridot a lot.

2301
02:29:10,700 --> 02:29:11,620
Wait, who do I sound like?

2302
02:29:11,620 --> 02:29:12,900
Who do I sound like?

2303
02:29:12,900 --> 02:29:15,020
I want to sound like you from Ruby.

2304
02:29:15,020 --> 02:29:17,020
I think they say, yeah, they think you

2305
02:29:17,020 --> 02:29:19,260
sound like Ruby Rose from Ruby.

2306
02:29:19,260 --> 02:29:20,820
That's cool.

2307
02:29:20,820 --> 02:29:21,660
Me?

2308
02:29:21,660 --> 02:29:22,900
Yeah, you.

2309
02:29:23,100 --> 02:29:24,100
Ruby Rose?

2310
02:29:24,100 --> 02:29:24,940
Ruby Rose?

2311
02:29:24,940 --> 02:29:26,500
Is that the girl with the red hair?

2312
02:29:26,500 --> 02:29:27,940
Yeah, black and red?

2313
02:29:27,940 --> 02:29:29,860
Oh, she has some color palette, too.

2314
02:29:30,700 --> 02:29:32,380
Oh my gosh.

2315
02:29:32,380 --> 02:29:34,340
I got to hurt the typing.

2316
02:29:34,340 --> 02:29:36,660
Wait, like Ruby Rose, like Ruby Rose,

2317
02:29:36,660 --> 02:29:39,700
like the not like the Australian model in action.

2318
02:29:39,700 --> 02:29:40,940
No, not.

2319
02:29:40,940 --> 02:29:42,100
No, no, no, Ruby Rose.

2320
02:29:42,100 --> 02:29:45,140
You sound just like her when you do your Australian accent.

2321
02:29:45,140 --> 02:29:46,580
How do you do that?

2322
02:29:46,580 --> 02:29:47,420
Australia.

2323
02:29:47,420 --> 02:29:48,260
What?

2324
02:29:48,260 --> 02:29:49,100
Australia.

2325
02:29:49,100 --> 02:29:50,580
Australia.

2326
02:29:50,580 --> 02:29:51,740
Australia.

2327
02:29:51,740 --> 02:29:56,100
My chat also agrees that they kind of hear the Ruby.

2328
02:29:56,100 --> 02:29:57,300
Who's Ruby?

2329
02:29:57,300 --> 02:29:58,500
Kind of, who is it?

2330
02:29:58,500 --> 02:29:59,340
Ruby Rose.

2331
02:29:59,340 --> 02:30:00,660
Oh, you know, oh, I send it to you.

2332
02:30:00,660 --> 02:30:02,900
It's a little like red girl, is it not?

2333
02:30:02,900 --> 02:30:03,900
With the red hair.

2334
02:30:03,900 --> 02:30:06,740
I never watch Ruby, so I don't know.

2335
02:30:06,740 --> 02:30:07,580
Not gonna go.

2336
02:30:07,580 --> 02:30:08,420
Guys, I'm feeling stupid.

2337
02:30:08,420 --> 02:30:09,660
Oh, that girl.

2338
02:30:09,660 --> 02:30:10,900
Also, wait, Chai, do you?

2339
02:30:10,900 --> 02:30:12,620
Oh, wait.

2340
02:30:12,620 --> 02:30:14,820
What the fuck is this GIF?

2341
02:30:14,820 --> 02:30:15,980
You cost, it's from the show.

2342
02:30:15,980 --> 02:30:18,060
The show sucks, by the way.

2343
02:30:18,060 --> 02:30:20,060
I didn't watch the first season.

2344
02:30:20,060 --> 02:30:20,900
Chai, did you watch the show?

2345
02:30:20,980 --> 02:30:22,820
I was really proud.

2346
02:30:22,820 --> 02:30:23,660
Have I?

2347
02:30:23,660 --> 02:30:24,860
Yeah.

2348
02:30:24,860 --> 02:30:29,300
I want you so bad, I beg and I plead and I pray and I ask.

2349
02:30:29,300 --> 02:30:32,980
It's just a lot because of the jacket.

2350
02:30:32,980 --> 02:30:35,460
I gotta get the jacket commissioned.

2351
02:30:35,460 --> 02:30:36,300
That's true.

2352
02:30:36,300 --> 02:30:38,380
But everything else I can figure out,

2353
02:30:38,380 --> 02:30:40,540
like 3D printing, like certain parts,

2354
02:30:40,540 --> 02:30:42,460
and like the cuffs and the chains.

2355
02:30:42,460 --> 02:30:43,820
You know how to 3D print?

2356
02:30:45,940 --> 02:30:48,780
I can, I have the ability to.

2357
02:30:48,780 --> 02:30:51,620
I don't have a 3D printer, but I know someone who does.

2358
02:30:51,620 --> 02:30:53,220
Oh, that's pretty cool.

2359
02:30:53,220 --> 02:30:56,740
And I get down on my hands and knees and say, please.

2360
02:30:56,740 --> 02:30:58,060
Please.

2361
02:30:58,060 --> 02:30:59,380
I think it would work out.

2362
02:31:00,740 --> 02:31:02,620
I do cosplay, though.

2363
02:31:02,620 --> 02:31:04,700
I just got back from a convention.

2364
02:31:04,700 --> 02:31:06,820
I cosplayed three different ladies.

2365
02:31:06,820 --> 02:31:09,500
I was freerun, freerun.

2366
02:31:09,500 --> 02:31:12,740
Oh my gosh, you would be so good as freerun.

2367
02:31:12,740 --> 02:31:15,260
I did her dinner, dinner.

2368
02:31:15,260 --> 02:31:16,540
Oh my gosh, I have to.

2369
02:31:16,540 --> 02:31:17,660
I can show you guys pictures.

2370
02:31:17,660 --> 02:31:19,260
Please.

2371
02:31:19,260 --> 02:31:22,460
Yeah, I think they're really appropriate.

2372
02:31:22,460 --> 02:31:29,180
I have a blue archive cosplay that just arrived of Hoshino.

2373
02:31:29,180 --> 02:31:33,540
And I also cosplayed a chopper from One Piece.

2374
02:31:33,540 --> 02:31:34,260
Oh, that's funny.

2375
02:31:34,260 --> 02:31:35,220
Oh, that's funny.

2376
02:31:35,220 --> 02:31:36,980
Do you have pictures of that one?

2377
02:31:36,980 --> 02:31:38,580
Yeah, I'm getting into One Piece.

2378
02:31:38,580 --> 02:31:40,540
I'm still getting into One Piece.

2379
02:31:40,540 --> 02:31:41,540
Yeah.

2380
02:31:41,540 --> 02:31:44,980
I watched the Netflix live action.

2381
02:31:44,980 --> 02:31:45,980
Yeah, that was pretty good.

2382
02:31:45,980 --> 02:31:49,940
It hooked me in like, OK, now I have to kind of watch the show.

2383
02:31:49,940 --> 02:31:52,540
Oh, yeah, I did watch the live action, too, yeah.

2384
02:31:52,540 --> 02:31:55,340
I would love to cosplay, but I have really bad anxiety,

2385
02:31:55,340 --> 02:31:58,380
so I don't leave my home enough to do that.

2386
02:31:58,380 --> 02:32:01,700
I haven't cosplayed in years at an actual convention.

2387
02:32:01,700 --> 02:32:03,660
It's been a very, very long time.

2388
02:32:03,660 --> 02:32:05,100
It's a whole other night.

2389
02:32:05,100 --> 02:32:07,420
Cosplaying at home is a lot less exhausting.

2390
02:32:10,100 --> 02:32:10,700
I don't know.

2391
02:32:10,700 --> 02:32:14,500
It's just like, I guess the fear of buying a cosplay

2392
02:32:14,500 --> 02:32:16,180
and then be like, I should have, like, work with you.

2393
02:32:16,180 --> 02:32:18,780
Oh, like, yeah, if it doesn't get all the money right.

2394
02:32:18,780 --> 02:32:20,820
My boobs usually don't fit into a lot of things,

2395
02:32:20,820 --> 02:32:25,340
so I'd have to play a very big, boobed character.

2396
02:32:25,340 --> 02:32:26,940
Yeah, I have that problem, too.

2397
02:32:26,940 --> 02:32:28,220
I have that problem, too.

2398
02:32:28,220 --> 02:32:29,780
Yeah.

2399
02:32:29,780 --> 02:32:30,780
My point.

2400
02:32:30,780 --> 02:32:33,180
Yeah.

2401
02:32:33,180 --> 02:32:38,220
Chai's body type is essentially her model, Koff.

2402
02:32:38,220 --> 02:32:39,300
It's really sad.

2403
02:32:39,300 --> 02:32:41,620
My model is taller, though.

2404
02:32:41,620 --> 02:32:43,740
I think my model would probably fit into cosplays

2405
02:32:43,780 --> 02:32:45,940
better than I could, just because of me.

2406
02:32:45,940 --> 02:32:46,980
I think I'm smaller.

2407
02:32:46,980 --> 02:32:47,780
She's so small.

2408
02:32:47,780 --> 02:32:48,540
It's like, sucks.

2409
02:32:48,540 --> 02:32:49,260
Yeah.

2410
02:32:49,260 --> 02:32:51,100
It's like, oh, cute.

2411
02:32:51,100 --> 02:32:54,580
There are a lot of really cute characters in my opinion.

2412
02:32:54,580 --> 02:32:57,060
I feel like you can ask me a lot of hard things.

2413
02:32:57,060 --> 02:32:58,460
Sometimes they make the small.

2414
02:32:58,460 --> 02:33:01,060
Sometimes the small isn't even, like, small.

2415
02:33:01,060 --> 02:33:01,580
I don't know.

2416
02:33:01,580 --> 02:33:05,940
I think I'm just, I'm just stubby.

2417
02:33:05,940 --> 02:33:08,940
No, I'm stubby.

2418
02:33:08,940 --> 02:33:11,460
For me, it's a lot of the time the cosplay parents

2419
02:33:11,460 --> 02:33:14,100
never go past my buttocks.

2420
02:33:14,100 --> 02:33:16,100
She's got a fat ass.

2421
02:33:16,100 --> 02:33:17,820
Yeah, my bag.

2422
02:33:17,820 --> 02:33:18,620
Yeah, yeah.

2423
02:33:18,620 --> 02:33:19,940
She's small with a fat ass.

2424
02:33:19,940 --> 02:33:22,260
Wait, don't be boob fat ass.

2425
02:33:22,260 --> 02:33:23,180
And let me have you.

2426
02:33:23,180 --> 02:33:25,140
You need to, man, too.

2427
02:33:25,140 --> 02:33:27,620
And then your little cute pet hunt.

2428
02:33:27,620 --> 02:33:30,140
OK, I'm also kind of, I'm also kind of pet-on,

2429
02:33:30,140 --> 02:33:30,740
so it's fine.

2430
02:33:30,740 --> 02:33:32,980
Yeah, you're also a pet-on, yeah.

2431
02:33:32,980 --> 02:33:33,980
Now we start that in sim.

2432
02:33:33,980 --> 02:33:36,180
It's just my butt.

2433
02:33:36,180 --> 02:33:37,420
That's the Hispanic jeans.

2434
02:33:37,420 --> 02:33:38,540
Just hit her there.

2435
02:33:38,540 --> 02:33:40,380
Yeah, it's just my butt.

2436
02:33:40,380 --> 02:33:41,060
I don't know why.

2437
02:33:41,140 --> 02:33:42,380
I don't understand.

2438
02:33:42,380 --> 02:33:44,220
I also haven't cosplayed in a long time

2439
02:33:44,220 --> 02:33:47,580
because people sometimes when you're brown

2440
02:33:47,580 --> 02:33:48,420
and you cosplay a white character.

2441
02:33:48,420 --> 02:33:50,260
Oh my god, it's so bad.

2442
02:33:50,260 --> 02:33:52,980
They just bitch and moan and I'm like, I don't.

2443
02:33:52,980 --> 02:33:53,460
Yeah.

2444
02:33:53,460 --> 02:33:55,700
You get called like the hard-art name version

2445
02:33:55,700 --> 02:33:56,500
of the character.

2446
02:33:56,500 --> 02:34:00,780
It's so, it's so, it's so mad.

2447
02:34:00,780 --> 02:34:02,900
It's like, damn, it's like they kind of got me there.

2448
02:34:02,900 --> 02:34:06,060
They'll be like, N-word, Shinobi or something like that.

2449
02:34:06,060 --> 02:34:08,980
I think I've seen that for like Gojo when somebody was

2450
02:34:08,980 --> 02:34:10,140
cosplaying as Gojo.

2451
02:34:11,940 --> 02:34:13,980
That's like the one thing that works.

2452
02:34:13,980 --> 02:34:16,660
No, no, no, I've seen somebody like a black Gojo

2453
02:34:16,660 --> 02:34:19,300
and people just fucking ragged on them.

2454
02:34:19,300 --> 02:34:20,580
It's ridiculous.

2455
02:34:20,580 --> 02:34:23,620
The cosplay community is like, it's just, you know,

2456
02:34:23,620 --> 02:34:25,620
like the cosplay community just kind of sucks.

2457
02:34:25,620 --> 02:34:31,300
Like it's very toxic and it's not warm and fuzzy

2458
02:34:31,300 --> 02:34:32,700
for the most part, but I can tell you.

2459
02:34:32,700 --> 02:34:36,500
Which is sucks because it's like, OK, this is not really weird.

2460
02:34:36,580 --> 02:34:38,940
I think when anime got mainstream and all the very

2461
02:34:38,940 --> 02:34:41,060
attractive people started doing cosplay,

2462
02:34:41,060 --> 02:34:43,620
it kind of ruined the vibe of like, oh, it's just a bunch

2463
02:34:43,620 --> 02:34:45,380
of nerds having fun together.

2464
02:34:45,380 --> 02:34:47,660
I agree, but it's like, when anime-

2465
02:34:47,660 --> 02:34:49,100
It's like Hot Girl Central.

2466
02:34:49,100 --> 02:34:51,540
Yeah, because it's like, in my opinion,

2467
02:34:51,540 --> 02:34:54,900
I appreciate like a more like messy looking cosplay

2468
02:34:54,900 --> 02:34:56,940
because like you can tell that they really like the character

2469
02:34:56,940 --> 02:35:00,180
than like a full blown, like full glam cosplay

2470
02:35:00,180 --> 02:35:01,340
because it's just for photo shoots.

2471
02:35:01,340 --> 02:35:05,460
Like, um, anime becoming popular sucks, it's so bad.

2472
02:35:05,460 --> 02:35:06,620
It's like retubing, too.

2473
02:35:06,620 --> 02:35:07,820
Like, it's so bad.

2474
02:35:07,820 --> 02:35:09,420
It's very mainstream, though.

2475
02:35:09,420 --> 02:35:10,980
It's sad. It is sad.

2476
02:35:10,980 --> 02:35:13,460
And it sucks to like say it because then you sound like

2477
02:35:13,460 --> 02:35:16,180
like a gatekeeper, like even gatekeeper.

2478
02:35:16,180 --> 02:35:18,340
But it's like, but it's true.

2479
02:35:18,340 --> 02:35:21,020
It is true because like the feeling of like the anime,

2480
02:35:21,020 --> 02:35:23,860
the community, the cosplay community and all that, like,

2481
02:35:23,860 --> 02:35:28,820
it was so different before like 2020, I'd say, like 20.

2482
02:35:28,820 --> 02:35:30,980
Yeah, 2020, like right around the pandemic,

2483
02:35:30,980 --> 02:35:32,900
when it did get really popular.

2484
02:35:32,900 --> 02:35:34,180
It was like, oh my God, yay.

2485
02:35:34,180 --> 02:35:36,500
All the people who bullied me, like finally, like,

2486
02:35:36,500 --> 02:35:38,140
now you guys can see it's cool.

2487
02:35:38,140 --> 02:35:40,580
But at the same time, like a lot of, yeah.

2488
02:35:40,580 --> 02:35:41,780
But yeah, exactly right.

2489
02:35:41,780 --> 02:35:43,780
Like, God damn, this is like, this is my thing.

2490
02:35:43,780 --> 02:35:45,940
It's like, yay, I know, it's supposed to be my thing,

2491
02:35:45,940 --> 02:35:48,020
where I was supposed to be like this little geek.

2492
02:35:48,020 --> 02:35:50,580
Like, they do it better because they're like hot and sexy

2493
02:35:50,580 --> 02:35:51,460
and like have a lot of.

2494
02:35:51,460 --> 02:35:56,100
It also sucks that a lot of anime is going to be very weird

2495
02:35:56,100 --> 02:35:57,980
and have very like obscure themes.

2496
02:35:57,980 --> 02:36:00,380
And then people are like, this is disgusting.

2497
02:36:01,500 --> 02:36:03,220
And it's like, even then, it's like, I could,

2498
02:36:03,260 --> 02:36:04,460
there's some anime that I'm like, you know,

2499
02:36:04,460 --> 02:36:05,860
that's a little too weird for my taste,

2500
02:36:05,860 --> 02:36:08,100
but I'm not going to show people that, like,

2501
02:36:08,100 --> 02:36:10,900
it's like the weird, like, puritan thing

2502
02:36:10,900 --> 02:36:13,340
people have going on with, and like just the anime.

2503
02:36:13,340 --> 02:36:14,300
Yeah.

2504
02:36:14,300 --> 02:36:15,820
And then like, oh my God,

2505
02:36:15,820 --> 02:36:17,820
so I could talk about this topic for hours.

2506
02:36:17,820 --> 02:36:20,620
It's like a different kind of like,

2507
02:36:20,620 --> 02:36:22,180
cause it's like initially, like it was like,

2508
02:36:22,180 --> 02:36:23,980
oh, I feel embarrassed that I like this stuff

2509
02:36:23,980 --> 02:36:26,060
because they're bullying me for liking anime.

2510
02:36:26,060 --> 02:36:26,900
Yeah.

2511
02:36:26,900 --> 02:36:29,660
But now that they know, it's like they have

2512
02:36:29,660 --> 02:36:32,060
all these things to say, like, oh, this is wrong.

2513
02:36:32,060 --> 02:36:34,620
You can't like this, but you can't like this.

2514
02:36:34,620 --> 02:36:35,860
You can't like this, you can't like this.

2515
02:36:35,860 --> 02:36:38,500
Like now that they're like, you know,

2516
02:36:38,500 --> 02:36:40,220
they're more familiar with it.

2517
02:36:40,220 --> 02:36:42,220
Yeah, they're dictating what's wrong.

2518
02:36:42,220 --> 02:36:44,180
It's like, no, no, no, no.

2519
02:36:44,180 --> 02:36:47,780
Happening with visual novels as well.

2520
02:36:47,780 --> 02:36:50,020
I have noticed that I've seen some stuff.

2521
02:36:50,020 --> 02:36:52,540
And it's really bad, cause in my opinion,

2522
02:36:52,540 --> 02:36:54,700
visual novels is the one medium

2523
02:36:54,700 --> 02:36:57,420
where people can be really weird.

2524
02:36:57,420 --> 02:37:01,660
There are some really like weird, disturbing visual novels

2525
02:37:01,740 --> 02:37:04,220
and people are like, oh, but the girls are cute,

2526
02:37:04,220 --> 02:37:06,220
but this game is so icky and gross.

2527
02:37:06,220 --> 02:37:07,460
You know, the place is weird.

2528
02:37:07,460 --> 02:37:09,060
It's like, maybe you look into the characters

2529
02:37:09,060 --> 02:37:11,180
before you're like, I'm in a cosplay-less character.

2530
02:37:11,180 --> 02:37:12,020
Yeah.

2531
02:37:12,900 --> 02:37:14,260
Saiyan Uta Kof Kof.

2532
02:37:14,260 --> 02:37:15,620
I think Afumo is,

2533
02:37:17,260 --> 02:37:19,740
Afumo should have never existed for Saiya.

2534
02:37:21,100 --> 02:37:24,180
I know, I was, I saw seeing a lot about that

2535
02:37:24,180 --> 02:37:27,340
on my timeline, just like Saiya blowing up and-

2536
02:37:27,340 --> 02:37:30,540
Yeah, Saiya's blowing up and people that hate the things

2537
02:37:30,540 --> 02:37:32,420
that Saiya talks about are like, I love Saiya.

2538
02:37:32,420 --> 02:37:34,340
She's so cool.

2539
02:37:34,340 --> 02:37:36,100
And it's like, you would not like the game,

2540
02:37:36,100 --> 02:37:37,420
but it's okay.

2541
02:37:38,340 --> 02:37:40,380
But then anime and VTuber are coming mainstream

2542
02:37:40,380 --> 02:37:41,700
was a mistake.

2543
02:37:42,700 --> 02:37:44,380
Gay keep it.

2544
02:37:44,380 --> 02:37:45,700
Push the little show.

2545
02:37:45,700 --> 02:37:47,540
Gay keep it, let's gay keep.

2546
02:37:47,540 --> 02:37:48,740
It's like, I don't want to gay keep,

2547
02:37:48,740 --> 02:37:50,180
cause it's like, I think it's fun to like

2548
02:37:50,180 --> 02:37:51,620
see VTuber merge in public,

2549
02:37:51,620 --> 02:37:53,340
but then it's like, it sucks when people are like,

2550
02:37:53,340 --> 02:37:55,940
this VTuber isn't talking about these things.

2551
02:37:55,940 --> 02:37:57,940
But VTuber does this thing, and it's like,

2552
02:37:59,060 --> 02:37:59,900
you know.

2553
02:38:00,020 --> 02:38:02,660
Everything feels so restricting, cause it's like,

2554
02:38:02,660 --> 02:38:05,780
oh, I feel like I have these rules to follow.

2555
02:38:05,780 --> 02:38:08,220
Or it's like, before I didn't feel like there was any rules,

2556
02:38:08,220 --> 02:38:09,540
I could just be like-

2557
02:38:09,540 --> 02:38:11,500
You need to be a little dork with other dorks

2558
02:38:11,500 --> 02:38:12,860
and having fun.

2559
02:38:12,860 --> 02:38:14,220
Be a little dork.

2560
02:38:14,220 --> 02:38:15,060
Yeah.

2561
02:38:15,060 --> 02:38:17,300
Yeah, you kind of put more under a microscope.

2562
02:38:18,500 --> 02:38:20,020
She's getting a figure too.

2563
02:38:20,020 --> 02:38:22,180
I know, that's like gonna be awful.

2564
02:38:23,380 --> 02:38:25,540
Plus Saiya's getting a figure?

2565
02:38:25,540 --> 02:38:27,940
Again, yeah, it's cause she got popular again.

2566
02:38:29,940 --> 02:38:32,140
It's such a hell of a lot of love.

2567
02:38:32,140 --> 02:38:33,860
It's such a hell of a lot of love.

2568
02:38:33,860 --> 02:38:35,300
It's such a hell of a lot of love.

2569
02:38:35,300 --> 02:38:36,700
It's such a hell of a lot of love.

2570
02:38:36,700 --> 02:38:38,380
What, what, what, what?

2571
02:38:38,380 --> 02:38:39,220
What, what, what?

2572
02:38:39,220 --> 02:38:40,580
That's the part where we all just like make weird noises.

2573
02:38:40,580 --> 02:38:41,500
Yeah, I know, I know.

2574
02:38:41,500 --> 02:38:42,340
Oh, I know.

2575
02:38:42,340 --> 02:38:45,340
I'm just very, I'm very passionate about my enemies

2576
02:38:45,340 --> 02:38:47,380
and my enemies' topic.

2577
02:38:47,380 --> 02:38:48,380
I don't know.

2578
02:38:48,380 --> 02:38:50,300
So all your enemies, I like weird.

2579
02:38:50,300 --> 02:38:53,460
Sunshine smiles, what about that?

2580
02:38:53,460 --> 02:38:55,740
Yeah, it's true, like fruit baskets.

2581
02:38:55,740 --> 02:38:56,580
Yeah!

2582
02:38:56,580 --> 02:38:58,940
Would they want more in this world?

2583
02:38:58,940 --> 02:39:01,620
No, they would want kindness and happiness.

2584
02:39:01,620 --> 02:39:02,860
Aw.

2585
02:39:02,860 --> 02:39:06,420
Happy, happy, smile, a little bunny cuteness.

2586
02:39:06,420 --> 02:39:06,920
It's real.

2587
02:39:06,920 --> 02:39:09,060
I watched Fritz basket in the longest time.

2588
02:39:09,060 --> 02:39:12,580
I literally, somebody snapped me back in to remind me

2589
02:39:12,580 --> 02:39:14,980
of like, Natalia acts as powers.

2590
02:39:14,980 --> 02:39:16,420
And I was like, holy crap.

2591
02:39:16,420 --> 02:39:18,380
Oh my god, Natalia!

2592
02:39:18,380 --> 02:39:19,220
Yeah, I know, right?

2593
02:39:19,220 --> 02:39:22,740
I think everyone can agree that Natalia did not age well.

2594
02:39:22,740 --> 02:39:23,240
No!

2595
02:39:23,240 --> 02:39:25,900
But Fritz could not admit that's one of the reasons.

2596
02:39:25,900 --> 02:39:27,460
No one talks about it.

2597
02:39:27,460 --> 02:39:31,020
Nobody, it's OK, it's fine.

2598
02:39:31,020 --> 02:39:35,860
I think that, I was really happy that Fritz basket got it.

2599
02:39:35,860 --> 02:39:38,260
Because Fritz basket was the first, like the original Fritz

2600
02:39:38,260 --> 02:39:41,780
basket was the first anime I ever watched.

2601
02:39:41,780 --> 02:39:44,500
So like, when I got a remake, I was really scared because I

2602
02:39:44,500 --> 02:39:47,300
was like, I can mess this up so bad.

2603
02:39:47,300 --> 02:39:48,140
I haven't watched the remake.

2604
02:39:48,140 --> 02:39:50,020
Is it good?

2605
02:39:50,020 --> 02:39:53,220
Yeah, I didn't watch the first season because I was like,

2606
02:39:53,220 --> 02:39:56,260
well, I feel like I already knew everything that happened.

2607
02:39:56,260 --> 02:39:58,220
But I watched the second season, third season,

2608
02:39:58,220 --> 02:39:59,140
and it was so good.

2609
02:39:59,140 --> 02:40:02,220
And I cried, and I was like, oh my god, happy.

2610
02:40:02,220 --> 02:40:02,780
I have to watch it.

2611
02:40:02,780 --> 02:40:04,540
It follows the manga a lot more.

2612
02:40:04,540 --> 02:40:07,060
I do recommend it if you have the time.

2613
02:40:07,060 --> 02:40:12,060
I will say, new romance anime for, OK.

2614
02:40:12,060 --> 02:40:13,580
I think you guys want to understand more.

2615
02:40:13,580 --> 02:40:15,780
Anime has become more for male, so it's

2616
02:40:15,780 --> 02:40:19,380
very hard to get female-centered romance anime.

2617
02:40:19,380 --> 02:40:20,620
Oh, like, so-so.

2618
02:40:20,620 --> 02:40:22,940
Yes, because if it's for men, no offense,

2619
02:40:22,940 --> 02:40:25,340
because there's some anime that are like, harrowing for guys.

2620
02:40:25,340 --> 02:40:26,740
And I'm like, oh, this is so great.

2621
02:40:26,740 --> 02:40:29,940
Like, 100 girlfriends that I really like you?

2622
02:40:29,940 --> 02:40:30,820
Great anime.

2623
02:40:30,820 --> 02:40:31,300
That was so cute.

2624
02:40:31,300 --> 02:40:32,660
Please watch an anime.

2625
02:40:32,660 --> 02:40:34,700
It's so good.

2626
02:40:34,700 --> 02:40:37,300
But I feel like we need more anime like Futsu Baskets

2627
02:40:37,300 --> 02:40:40,340
and Nana and Paradise Kiss for women.

2628
02:40:40,340 --> 02:40:40,740
I know.

2629
02:40:40,740 --> 02:40:41,700
That'll never happen.

2630
02:40:41,700 --> 02:40:44,140
I feel like I wonder if we'll ever return.

2631
02:40:44,140 --> 02:40:46,700
But then there's like, I feel like all the mangas that

2632
02:40:46,700 --> 02:40:48,900
would be the same, they're not going to get adapted

2633
02:40:48,900 --> 02:40:52,300
because they're so old and no one talks about them anymore.

2634
02:40:52,300 --> 02:40:54,180
Or they're too small and obscure.

2635
02:40:54,180 --> 02:40:57,980
They have no English translation, so it's no point.

2636
02:40:57,980 --> 02:41:00,660
I'm reading your chat, but I'm not this and guys

2637
02:41:00,660 --> 02:41:02,940
that like, show Joe, I don't, I think you misinterpreted.

2638
02:41:02,940 --> 02:41:06,780
I'm saying not a lot of anime's art, like, for women,

2639
02:41:06,780 --> 02:41:09,180
like, like, or on Host Club.

2640
02:41:09,180 --> 02:41:09,940
I miss Aura.

2641
02:41:09,940 --> 02:41:10,500
Things like that.

2642
02:41:10,500 --> 02:41:10,940
Oh, my God.

2643
02:41:10,940 --> 02:41:11,460
I miss Aura.

2644
02:41:11,460 --> 02:41:12,860
I miss Aura.

2645
02:41:12,860 --> 02:41:16,180
Peach Girl, like, we're missing, like, we're missing the female,

2646
02:41:16,180 --> 02:41:18,180
like, for the female fans.

2647
02:41:18,180 --> 02:41:22,500
And it's not the same.

2648
02:41:22,500 --> 02:41:23,060
You know what I mean?

2649
02:41:23,060 --> 02:41:25,180
You need some of the for the girlies, you know?

2650
02:41:25,180 --> 02:41:25,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2651
02:41:25,940 --> 02:41:27,140
That is really scary.

2652
02:41:27,140 --> 02:41:31,220
Kimi ni todoke, it's the romance one.

2653
02:41:31,220 --> 02:41:33,620
She has, like, long, straight, black hair.

2654
02:41:33,620 --> 02:41:35,820
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

2655
02:41:35,820 --> 02:41:37,140
What's that one about?

2656
02:41:37,140 --> 02:41:38,380
Yes.

2657
02:41:38,380 --> 02:41:41,780
I think she's like popular boy and she's like weird, scary girl,

2658
02:41:41,780 --> 02:41:42,420
but they end up together.

2659
02:41:42,420 --> 02:41:44,020
Oh, yes, I heard about that one.

2660
02:41:44,020 --> 02:41:44,820
I haven't watched it though.

2661
02:41:44,820 --> 02:41:47,220
It's literally the anime of fucking miscommunication.

2662
02:41:47,220 --> 02:41:48,500
They're really, she's so mean.

2663
02:41:48,500 --> 02:41:50,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2664
02:41:50,620 --> 02:41:52,660
My dress of darling is such a guy anime.

2665
02:41:52,660 --> 02:41:53,620
I am so sorry.

2666
02:41:53,620 --> 02:41:55,620
Oh, yeah, that one has fanservice.

2667
02:41:55,620 --> 02:41:56,700
Yeah, that's for guys.

2668
02:41:56,700 --> 02:41:57,380
That one's like, yeah.

2669
02:41:57,380 --> 02:42:00,220
So the difference between, oh my gosh, I look such a dork.

2670
02:42:00,220 --> 02:42:02,820
The difference between female and male-centered animes

2671
02:42:02,820 --> 02:42:07,220
is that male-centered animes will have a lot of, like,

2672
02:42:07,220 --> 02:42:09,300
unnecessary fan service for the girls.

2673
02:42:09,300 --> 02:42:11,540
And then, like, the girl ones are like,

2674
02:42:11,540 --> 02:42:15,860
oh, holy shit, the beach episode is your fan service.

2675
02:42:15,860 --> 02:42:18,340
But the beach episode is always, like, a part of the plot.

2676
02:42:18,340 --> 02:42:21,020
Like, in Oron Coast Club, they go into, like, the little water

2677
02:42:21,020 --> 02:42:22,620
park.

2678
02:42:22,620 --> 02:42:24,420
Or, like, I think of, like, animes, like,

2679
02:42:24,420 --> 02:42:25,860
do you guys remember Free?

2680
02:42:25,860 --> 02:42:27,140
Like, that was, like, a big one.

2681
02:42:27,140 --> 02:42:28,140
Yes.

2682
02:42:28,140 --> 02:42:30,660
Free was supposed to be a yowie anime, by the way.

2683
02:42:30,660 --> 02:42:33,060
Yeah, or, like, it played against it.

2684
02:42:33,060 --> 02:42:35,180
It was, like, a tease the whole time.

2685
02:42:35,180 --> 02:42:36,740
I remember fucking being obsessed with that.

2686
02:42:36,740 --> 02:42:38,140
But it's, like, usually.

2687
02:42:38,140 --> 02:42:38,740
Who did you ship?

2688
02:42:38,740 --> 02:42:41,100
Was it Rin Haru or Mako Haru?

2689
02:42:41,100 --> 02:42:42,980
Oh, no, yeah.

2690
02:42:42,980 --> 02:42:44,140
What did you say?

2691
02:42:44,140 --> 02:42:44,740
Both.

2692
02:42:44,740 --> 02:42:45,220
Both?

2693
02:42:45,220 --> 02:42:46,340
Yeah, I think I was Rin Haru.

2694
02:42:46,340 --> 02:42:48,780
Oh, Nagisa on the blue-haired guy with the glasses.

2695
02:42:48,780 --> 02:42:50,980
That was my, like, oh, chin.

2696
02:42:51,940 --> 02:42:52,740
Wait, wait, wait.

2697
02:42:52,740 --> 02:42:57,580
Who was your first character you shipped together?

2698
02:42:57,580 --> 02:42:58,860
Wait, what'd you say?

2699
02:42:58,860 --> 02:43:01,820
You're both first characters you shipped together.

2700
02:43:01,820 --> 02:43:02,740
Like, in general.

2701
02:43:02,740 --> 02:43:05,380
He could have caught him.

2702
02:43:05,380 --> 02:43:06,380
Wait, what?

2703
02:43:06,380 --> 02:43:07,740
He could have caught him?

2704
02:43:07,740 --> 02:43:08,820
He could have caught him?

2705
02:43:08,820 --> 02:43:09,780
Are you kidding?

2706
02:43:09,780 --> 02:43:10,700
Oh, so true.

2707
02:43:10,700 --> 02:43:11,180
That's a lie.

2708
02:43:11,180 --> 02:43:13,460
Yeah, I'm glad you're right.

2709
02:43:13,460 --> 02:43:15,460
I wanted you to ship them, though.

2710
02:43:15,460 --> 02:43:18,220
Yeah, but they literally, like, sleep together naked.

2711
02:43:18,220 --> 02:43:24,740
Listen, my young brain did not care.

2712
02:43:24,740 --> 02:43:29,380
And, you know, Twinsist is Winsist.

2713
02:43:29,380 --> 02:43:31,100
I do love that, I mean, I think it also

2714
02:43:31,100 --> 02:43:32,300
eats pretty bad things.

2715
02:43:32,300 --> 02:43:34,780
Oh, yeah, 100%.

2716
02:43:34,780 --> 02:43:37,220
What about you, Chai?

2717
02:43:37,220 --> 02:43:39,060
See it again?

2718
02:43:39,060 --> 02:43:42,580
The first two characters you ever shipped together?

2719
02:43:42,580 --> 02:43:47,140
First two characters I ever shipped together was Fruitsbasket.

2720
02:43:47,140 --> 02:43:51,820
It would have been Yuki and Toru.

2721
02:43:51,820 --> 02:43:52,780
OK, OK, OK.

2722
02:43:52,780 --> 02:43:54,260
That's cute.

2723
02:43:54,260 --> 02:43:59,340
And then Honey Senpai and Mori Senpai.

2724
02:43:59,340 --> 02:44:00,020
Oh, yes.

2725
02:44:00,020 --> 02:44:04,820
I also shipped a thousand, like, millions.

2726
02:44:04,820 --> 02:44:06,340
I'm going to tell you mine.

2727
02:44:06,340 --> 02:44:08,420
And this is the reason why I asked this question,

2728
02:44:08,420 --> 02:44:09,660
because mine's is really bad.

2729
02:44:09,660 --> 02:44:10,260
OK.

2730
02:44:10,260 --> 02:44:10,900
I want to know.

2731
02:44:10,900 --> 02:44:14,420
So mine's was SpongeBob and Squidward.

2732
02:44:14,420 --> 02:44:16,780
Oh, we're going that far back?

2733
02:44:17,220 --> 02:44:19,540
Oh, I thought we were in the context of anime.

2734
02:44:19,540 --> 02:44:22,100
Oh, no, no, I said first, not anime.

2735
02:44:22,100 --> 02:44:23,100
Anime is different.

2736
02:44:23,100 --> 02:44:25,540
Anime, mine's was SpongeBob and Squidward.

2737
02:44:25,540 --> 02:44:27,020
Mine's was going crazy.

2738
02:44:27,020 --> 02:44:28,540
They're very confused.

2739
02:44:28,540 --> 02:44:31,180
And I would always draw them kissing.

2740
02:44:31,180 --> 02:44:34,900
And I would, like, follow Japanese artists and, like,

2741
02:44:34,900 --> 02:44:35,500
things like that.

2742
02:44:35,500 --> 02:44:40,060
And then I went down the Tom and Jerry

2743
02:44:40,060 --> 02:44:42,180
pipeline of, like, Japanese artists.

2744
02:44:42,180 --> 02:44:47,020
And they still draw them together until this day.

2745
02:44:47,020 --> 02:44:48,540
SquidBob.

2746
02:44:48,540 --> 02:44:51,340
Yeah, I was like, SquidBob or SpongeWade.

2747
02:44:51,340 --> 02:44:54,340
Mine, if it wasn't anime related, I'm like.

2748
02:44:54,340 --> 02:44:55,620
It's just any media.

2749
02:44:55,620 --> 02:44:57,740
Any media that you, like, consumed so much,

2750
02:44:57,740 --> 02:44:58,940
there was, like, yeah.

2751
02:44:58,940 --> 02:45:02,740
I'm like, was it, like, Starfire and Raven?

2752
02:45:02,740 --> 02:45:04,340
From Teen Titans, I don't know.

2753
02:45:04,340 --> 02:45:07,180
Oh, that's good, that's good.

2754
02:45:07,180 --> 02:45:08,660
Yeah, I can't recall.

2755
02:45:08,660 --> 02:45:12,020
I'm too old for that at the age of 56.

2756
02:45:12,020 --> 02:45:15,180
Damn, sorry.

2757
02:45:15,180 --> 02:45:17,420
Cosmo and Timmy.

2758
02:45:17,420 --> 02:45:19,780
You know, I see, I was thinking that, too.

2759
02:45:19,780 --> 02:45:21,700
Like, first, when I was trying to think back,

2760
02:45:21,700 --> 02:45:23,180
I'm like, was that Cosmo?

2761
02:45:23,180 --> 02:45:25,860
Oh, yeah, Cosmo and Timmy, I think.

2762
02:45:25,860 --> 02:45:27,940
No, I got to think about that hard.

2763
02:45:27,940 --> 02:45:30,900
I feel like I wasn't, like, in the shipping mindset.

2764
02:45:30,900 --> 02:45:32,940
I was just like, yeah, TV on my screen.

2765
02:45:32,940 --> 02:45:34,260
TV on my screen.

2766
02:45:34,260 --> 02:45:38,060
I can tell you what moment made me ship them together.

2767
02:45:38,060 --> 02:45:38,540
Please tell me.

2768
02:45:38,540 --> 02:45:39,300
I know exactly.

2769
02:45:39,300 --> 02:45:40,140
It's so bad.

2770
02:45:40,140 --> 02:45:45,540
So when SpongeBob finds him eating a crabby patty,

2771
02:45:45,540 --> 02:45:47,540
and he's like, you like them, don't you screw him.

2772
02:45:47,540 --> 02:45:49,860
He's going on fairies with Lesley.

2773
02:45:49,860 --> 02:45:51,700
Oh, yes, I remember this one.

2774
02:45:51,700 --> 02:45:54,620
I was in, like, my anime phase, so I saw that,

2775
02:45:54,620 --> 02:45:58,660
and I was like, yeah, this is peak.

2776
02:45:58,660 --> 02:46:01,340
This is my OTP.

2777
02:46:01,340 --> 02:46:07,300
Yeah, this is my OTP, and I have, like, a fan page for them.

2778
02:46:07,300 --> 02:46:10,340
My friend Kumi, she's in chat right now,

2779
02:46:10,340 --> 02:46:13,180
and she said Mr. Krabson Plankton.

2780
02:46:13,180 --> 02:46:14,940
Oh, that's a good one.

2781
02:46:14,940 --> 02:46:17,100
That's a really good one.

2782
02:46:17,100 --> 02:46:20,460
But, no, it wasn't the inflation part.

2783
02:46:20,460 --> 02:46:21,460
It wasn't when he was fat.

2784
02:46:21,460 --> 02:46:23,220
It was like, he was just, like, eating it,

2785
02:46:23,220 --> 02:46:25,860
and he was like, oh, you like them, don't you screw him.

2786
02:46:25,860 --> 02:46:27,060
He's like, no, I don't.

2787
02:46:27,060 --> 02:46:28,620
And then I thought of, like, an anime

2788
02:46:28,620 --> 02:46:30,620
where they, like, kabadon each other.

2789
02:46:30,620 --> 02:46:32,020
And then, you know, last year, I was like, oh, my god,

2790
02:46:32,020 --> 02:46:36,020
what did SpongeBob was kabadoning fucking Squidward?

2791
02:46:36,020 --> 02:46:37,340
Oh, my god.

2792
02:46:37,340 --> 02:46:38,540
Wait, you remember?

2793
02:46:38,540 --> 02:46:41,020
There was that one scene where it's like,

2794
02:46:41,020 --> 02:46:43,100
SpongeBob says bye Squidward twice,

2795
02:46:43,100 --> 02:46:44,860
and he's like, yeah, I like Squidward.

2796
02:46:44,860 --> 02:46:46,460
He's like, I like Squidward.

2797
02:46:46,460 --> 02:46:50,140
Like, I like Squidward, I'm telling you,

2798
02:46:50,140 --> 02:46:53,220
they didn't even mention Squidward, so.

2799
02:46:53,220 --> 02:46:55,260
They teased it.

2800
02:46:55,260 --> 02:46:56,300
I loved it.

2801
02:46:56,300 --> 02:46:57,660
I don't know, I had, like, I don't know,

2802
02:46:57,660 --> 02:46:59,540
I was like, I was just a crack ship.

2803
02:46:59,540 --> 02:47:02,140
Yeah, I was like, yeah, I was just a crack ship.

2804
02:47:02,140 --> 02:47:05,620
Yeah, Gojo and Cinderella is the one that's like a thing.

2805
02:47:05,620 --> 02:47:07,340
Yeah, that's a thing.

2806
02:47:07,340 --> 02:47:08,180
How the fuck is that?

2807
02:47:08,180 --> 02:47:09,020
I don't know why.

2808
02:47:09,020 --> 02:47:10,180
I don't know, what?

2809
02:47:10,180 --> 02:47:11,020
Wait, no.

2810
02:47:11,020 --> 02:47:13,020
What's the bikini bottom horror?

2811
02:47:13,020 --> 02:47:15,020
Someone said blame Sheebie.

2812
02:47:15,020 --> 02:47:16,540
What's the bikini?

2813
02:47:16,540 --> 02:47:18,020
Oh, Sheebie, sheebie deal.

2814
02:47:18,020 --> 02:47:20,140
I don't know what they mean by that.

2815
02:47:20,140 --> 02:47:24,140
Oh, oh, it's not your fault, it's just your fault.

2816
02:47:24,140 --> 02:47:26,140
It's just my fault.

2817
02:47:26,140 --> 02:47:27,340
No, wait, I got it wrong.

2818
02:47:27,340 --> 02:47:31,900
It's Sakuna and Cinderella, and then it's Gojo and Elsa.

2819
02:47:31,900 --> 02:47:34,420
Elsa, I was gonna say it's 100% Elsa

2820
02:47:34,420 --> 02:47:35,260
because they like math.

2821
02:47:35,260 --> 02:47:38,900
It's Elsa, yeah, but Sakuna and Cinderella, I don't know.

2822
02:47:38,900 --> 02:47:39,740
Gojo and Cinderella.

2823
02:47:39,740 --> 02:47:41,220
Although, I do like those random edits

2824
02:47:41,220 --> 02:47:44,540
where they'll splice a bunch of Disney cartoons together

2825
02:47:44,540 --> 02:47:45,380
and TikTok.

2826
02:47:45,380 --> 02:47:47,420
Do you know, like, Vima, Bad Boy, Vima, Vima, Vima, Vima.

2827
02:47:47,420 --> 02:47:49,340
Yeah, baby, get it.

2828
02:47:49,340 --> 02:47:52,940
I think there's some shrek in someone from El Dorado

2829
02:47:52,940 --> 02:47:55,540
or something, I don't even fucking know.

2830
02:47:55,540 --> 02:47:57,060
Wait, what's El Dorado?

2831
02:47:57,060 --> 02:48:02,940
It's an old, lesser known Disney movie, animated movie.

2832
02:48:02,940 --> 02:48:05,780
You would probably like it, The Road to El Dorado.

2833
02:48:05,780 --> 02:48:06,620
Yeah, I know it.

2834
02:48:06,620 --> 02:48:08,100
Because you're Spanish.

2835
02:48:08,100 --> 02:48:09,460
OK, thanks.

2836
02:48:09,460 --> 02:48:13,580
Ash, Ash, catch them in Sky from Paw Patrol.

2837
02:48:13,580 --> 02:48:14,740
Oh, it's DreamWorks.

2838
02:48:14,740 --> 02:48:17,020
This Sky of Dog?

2839
02:48:17,020 --> 02:48:18,460
Sky's a dog.

2840
02:48:18,460 --> 02:48:20,460
What?

2841
02:48:20,460 --> 02:48:23,660
You don't know El Dorado?

2842
02:48:23,660 --> 02:48:24,660
Sorry, DreamWorks.

2843
02:48:24,660 --> 02:48:27,380
Next could be something you should compare and deal.

2844
02:48:27,380 --> 02:48:30,620
I did ship Gojo and Dio when I watched it,

2845
02:48:30,620 --> 02:48:31,660
but I thought it was a great ship.

2846
02:48:31,660 --> 02:48:33,140
How could you not?

2847
02:48:33,140 --> 02:48:35,220
Yeah, I did, too.

2848
02:48:35,220 --> 02:48:38,420
I always love enemies to lovers.

2849
02:48:38,420 --> 02:48:40,820
In real life, though, that'd be fucking insufferable,

2850
02:48:40,820 --> 02:48:42,180
but enemies to lovers, right?

2851
02:48:42,180 --> 02:48:42,860
Yeah.

2852
02:48:42,860 --> 02:48:44,140
Or rivals to lovers.

2853
02:48:44,140 --> 02:48:44,660
I like that.

2854
02:48:44,660 --> 02:48:50,060
Like, that's a more realistic trope, in my opinion.

2855
02:48:50,060 --> 02:48:51,220
Sky is a dog.

2856
02:48:51,220 --> 02:48:52,500
What do you mean it would make more sun?

2857
02:48:52,500 --> 02:48:52,980
Shut up.

2858
02:48:52,980 --> 02:48:53,660
Wait, what?

2859
02:48:53,660 --> 02:48:55,500
I missed that part of it.

2860
02:48:55,500 --> 02:48:58,340
She looked up Ash, catch them in Sky from Paw Patrol.

2861
02:48:58,340 --> 02:48:59,500
Ash, catch them in Sky.

2862
02:48:59,500 --> 02:49:00,340
Nothing came up.

2863
02:49:00,380 --> 02:49:02,300
I think that's just their personal ship.

2864
02:49:02,300 --> 02:49:02,780
What?

2865
02:49:02,780 --> 02:49:03,900
That's just their personal.

2866
02:49:03,900 --> 02:49:05,380
That's just their own thing.

2867
02:49:05,380 --> 02:49:05,860
That's it.

2868
02:49:05,860 --> 02:49:06,900
Yeah, that's their own.

2869
02:49:06,900 --> 02:49:08,260
What the fuck?

2870
02:49:08,260 --> 02:49:08,740
You freak.

2871
02:49:08,740 --> 02:49:09,980
Is this a pinkish dog?

2872
02:49:09,980 --> 02:49:10,980
Or like, has paint on it?

2873
02:49:10,980 --> 02:49:12,460
Yeah, that's a girl dog, I think.

2874
02:49:12,460 --> 02:49:13,940
Oh, my god.

2875
02:49:13,940 --> 02:49:16,300
The only girl dog on the team.

2876
02:49:16,300 --> 02:49:19,140
Stuart Little in Wreck-It-Row.

2877
02:49:19,140 --> 02:49:19,660
Oh, my god.

2878
02:49:19,660 --> 02:49:22,980
I had a huge crush on Stuart Little.

2879
02:49:22,980 --> 02:49:24,580
I had a really big crush on Stuart Little.

2880
02:49:24,580 --> 02:49:25,340
No, I made Stuart Little.

2881
02:49:25,340 --> 02:49:26,340
I ate him, I ate him, I ate him.

2882
02:49:26,340 --> 02:49:28,940
I think it says, like, in my brain, in my brain,

2883
02:49:28,940 --> 02:49:30,740
I was like, nerdy white guy, you know,

2884
02:49:30,740 --> 02:49:33,660
brown women attracted to a white man.

2885
02:49:33,660 --> 02:49:35,220
That's cool, lead balls.

2886
02:49:35,220 --> 02:49:37,460
No, I ain't doing it, I don't hate him.

2887
02:49:37,460 --> 02:49:39,580
I have to look up these movies in Spanish,

2888
02:49:39,580 --> 02:49:42,180
because I don't know what that, I treasure planet.

2889
02:49:42,180 --> 02:49:42,620
What is that?

2890
02:49:42,620 --> 02:49:45,620
I hate Stuart Little for trying to put a deep, rooted

2891
02:49:45,620 --> 02:49:47,300
personal reason.

2892
02:49:47,300 --> 02:49:47,780
Why?

2893
02:49:47,780 --> 02:49:49,220
I know.

2894
02:49:49,220 --> 02:49:51,380
I also, I could tell you guys.

2895
02:49:51,380 --> 02:49:53,500
I don't like Stuart Little because I remember watching

2896
02:49:53,500 --> 02:49:56,580
Mouse Hunt, and I hated the Mouse and Mouse Hunt.

2897
02:49:56,620 --> 02:49:59,940
And then, Stuart Little was also a Mouse, so.

2898
02:49:59,940 --> 02:50:01,100
That's fair.

2899
02:50:01,100 --> 02:50:03,860
See, somebody, I watched in Spanish.

2900
02:50:03,860 --> 02:50:06,340
When I see the English child, I have to Google them,

2901
02:50:06,340 --> 02:50:08,500
because I don't know what that means.

2902
02:50:08,500 --> 02:50:09,340
Why they do that?

2903
02:50:09,340 --> 02:50:13,100
Wait, what about Reckon Ralph's ex-fixit Felix?

2904
02:50:13,100 --> 02:50:14,100
I shit that.

2905
02:50:14,100 --> 02:50:15,860
Well, that's just, yeah, that's just, like, you know, again.

2906
02:50:15,860 --> 02:50:16,900
Like, I had a rival.

2907
02:50:16,900 --> 02:50:20,100
I like the, yeah, rivals under me.

2908
02:50:20,100 --> 02:50:22,700
It was funny, though, because he was, like, Ralph.

2909
02:50:22,700 --> 02:50:24,180
They weren't even mean to each other.

2910
02:50:24,180 --> 02:50:27,060
They were just, like, hey, Ralph, you just can't hang out here.

2911
02:50:27,060 --> 02:50:29,460
You break everything.

2912
02:50:29,460 --> 02:50:35,060
Wait, Reckon Ralph ex-merida from Brave is, like, a real chip.

2913
02:50:35,060 --> 02:50:35,860
It's a real chip.

2914
02:50:35,860 --> 02:50:41,460
If you had the chance to change your fate, would ya?

2915
02:50:41,460 --> 02:50:44,380
Oh, yes, I fucking love Treasure Planets.

2916
02:50:44,380 --> 02:50:46,860
OK, why did you give the cat lady to the fat ass?

2917
02:50:46,860 --> 02:50:48,540
Is this, like, an actual thing?

2918
02:50:48,540 --> 02:50:51,380
She doesn't have a fat ass in the movie,

2919
02:50:51,380 --> 02:50:52,380
but that's pretty cool.

2920
02:50:52,380 --> 02:50:53,380
Yeah, I like that image.

2921
02:50:53,380 --> 02:50:55,380
I like how she's turning around.

2922
02:50:55,380 --> 02:50:59,380
OK, I'm like, like, they just made her ass so big.

2923
02:50:59,380 --> 02:51:00,380
Like, why?

2924
02:51:00,380 --> 02:51:02,380
Like, in the group chat, I looked up Treasure Planets.

2925
02:51:02,380 --> 02:51:03,380
I was looking for things I saw.

2926
02:51:03,380 --> 02:51:04,380
Why is her butt cheeks so big?

2927
02:51:04,380 --> 02:51:07,380
I own Treasure Planet on DVD.

2928
02:51:07,380 --> 02:51:09,380
I'm pretty proud of that.

2929
02:51:09,380 --> 02:51:11,380
Oh, my gosh.

2930
02:51:11,380 --> 02:51:13,380
That's a pretty good reaction.

2931
02:51:13,380 --> 02:51:15,380
Reckon's rerun?

2932
02:51:15,380 --> 02:51:16,380
That's a thing.

2933
02:51:16,380 --> 02:51:18,380
Is there art of that?

2934
02:51:18,380 --> 02:51:19,380
I was looking it up.

2935
02:51:20,380 --> 02:51:22,380
How about Freerun?

2936
02:51:22,380 --> 02:51:25,380
No, if I did Freerun X, it's just going to be Himmel.

2937
02:51:25,380 --> 02:51:26,380
I own it on VHS.

2938
02:51:26,380 --> 02:51:30,380
I don't think it ever was on VHS.

2939
02:51:30,380 --> 02:51:32,380
Oh, it's a, oh, yeah.

2940
02:51:32,380 --> 02:51:36,380
I remember that little meme, the little meme.

2941
02:51:36,380 --> 02:51:38,380
I don't understand what's happening now in English.

2942
02:51:38,380 --> 02:51:40,380
My brain's trying to understand this fucking English language.

2943
02:51:40,380 --> 02:51:41,380
Oh, my god.

2944
02:51:41,380 --> 02:51:42,380
Look at this.

2945
02:51:42,380 --> 02:51:43,380
Everyone, look it.

2946
02:51:43,380 --> 02:51:44,380
Shrek X Freerun.

2947
02:51:44,380 --> 02:51:45,380
They're crazy.

2948
02:51:45,380 --> 02:51:46,380
That's a thing?

2949
02:51:46,380 --> 02:51:47,380
Wait, can you post?

2950
02:51:47,380 --> 02:51:48,380
Yeah, you know, there's, like, yeah.

2951
02:51:48,380 --> 02:51:50,380
Oh, yeah, I can post it.

2952
02:51:50,380 --> 02:51:52,380
It's all you have on your stream.

2953
02:51:52,380 --> 02:51:53,380
I just logged it.

2954
02:51:53,380 --> 02:51:54,380
There's this art.

2955
02:51:54,380 --> 02:51:56,380
Wait, no, no, no.

2956
02:51:56,380 --> 02:51:57,380
Ignore that photo.

2957
02:51:57,380 --> 02:51:58,380
Ignore that.

2958
02:51:58,380 --> 02:51:59,380
Ignore that.

2959
02:51:59,380 --> 02:52:00,380
Ignore that.

2960
02:52:00,380 --> 02:52:01,380
Ignore that.

2961
02:52:01,380 --> 02:52:02,380
Ignore that.

2962
02:52:02,380 --> 02:52:03,380
Ignore that.

2963
02:52:03,380 --> 02:52:05,380
They just sent a white one in a very blue.

2964
02:52:05,380 --> 02:52:07,380
Mine's the color of a bubble.

2965
02:52:07,380 --> 02:52:09,380
It's really blue.

2966
02:52:09,380 --> 02:52:10,380
Ignore it.

2967
02:52:10,380 --> 02:52:11,380
Ignore that.

2968
02:52:11,380 --> 02:52:12,380
Okay, look at this.

2969
02:52:12,380 --> 02:52:14,380
Oh, that's actually pretty good art.

2970
02:52:14,380 --> 02:52:15,380
Is he picking her up?

2971
02:52:15,380 --> 02:52:17,380
I don't like that.

2972
02:52:17,380 --> 02:52:19,380
Her Shrek is super short.

2973
02:52:19,380 --> 02:52:21,380
Do you think she would like Shrek?

2974
02:52:21,380 --> 02:52:23,380
I think she would love Shrek.

2975
02:52:23,380 --> 02:52:24,380
I think she'd be.

2976
02:52:24,380 --> 02:52:29,380
Yeah, honestly, I think she would actually have a thing for him.

2977
02:52:29,380 --> 02:52:30,380
Oh, my gosh.

2978
02:52:30,380 --> 02:52:32,380
You should get art of you and Shrek, CB.

2979
02:52:32,380 --> 02:52:33,380
How about no?

2980
02:52:33,380 --> 02:52:37,380
All right, so I'm going to draw art of you and Shrek together.

2981
02:52:37,380 --> 02:52:42,380
Wait, do you guys have, like, a fictional character, like, like, crush that you, like,

2982
02:52:42,380 --> 02:52:45,380
push to be, like, silly and wacky?

2983
02:52:46,380 --> 02:52:48,380
Akira from Persona 5.

2984
02:52:48,380 --> 02:52:50,380
I actually don't.

2985
02:52:50,380 --> 02:52:51,380
I don't, I don't know.

2986
02:52:51,380 --> 02:52:53,380
Do you guys want to shit me with somebody?

2987
02:52:53,380 --> 02:52:55,380
Asking my, asking my hair.

2988
02:52:55,380 --> 02:52:56,380
Let me think.

2989
02:52:56,380 --> 02:52:57,380
What?

2990
02:52:57,380 --> 02:52:58,380
Oh, I know who I would shit you with.

2991
02:52:58,380 --> 02:52:59,380
I would shit, okay.

2992
02:52:59,380 --> 02:53:02,380
Wait, do you like, what kind of man do you like?

2993
02:53:02,380 --> 02:53:03,380
Do I continue?

2994
02:53:03,380 --> 02:53:04,380
Donkey, Donkey from Shrek.

2995
02:53:04,380 --> 02:53:05,380
Donkey?

2996
02:53:05,380 --> 02:53:07,380
You want to shit me with Donkey?

2997
02:53:07,380 --> 02:53:08,380
I can see you.

2998
02:53:08,380 --> 02:53:10,380
I don't like that at all.

2999
02:53:10,380 --> 02:53:13,380
You don't have the dragon that he, like, marries?

3000
02:53:13,380 --> 02:53:14,380
Oh, it's true.

3001
02:53:14,380 --> 02:53:17,380
I'm the dragon from Shrek.

3002
02:53:17,380 --> 02:53:18,380
I do like you guys.

3003
02:53:18,380 --> 02:53:20,380
I like guys who are funny.

3004
02:53:20,380 --> 02:53:21,380
That is true.

3005
02:53:21,380 --> 02:53:25,380
The main character from Golden Boy would love she be so much said in my chat.

3006
02:53:25,380 --> 02:53:27,380
Who, from Golden Boy?

3007
02:53:27,380 --> 02:53:28,380
Oh, yeah.

3008
02:53:28,380 --> 02:53:30,380
What is that?

3009
02:53:30,380 --> 02:53:31,380
It's a little old.

3010
02:53:31,380 --> 02:53:32,380
It's an anime, but some wacky.

3011
02:53:32,380 --> 02:53:33,380
It's wacky.

3012
02:53:33,380 --> 02:53:35,380
Okay, I'll have to look that up.

3013
02:53:35,380 --> 02:53:37,380
But mine is Akira from Persona 5.

3014
02:53:37,380 --> 02:53:41,380
I think guys are really fluffier and glasses really, like, get me going.

3015
02:53:41,380 --> 02:53:45,380
So, Senpai from Nagatoru.

3016
02:53:45,380 --> 02:53:49,380
I hate Nagatoru, but I, like, love Senpai from Nagatoru.

3017
02:53:49,380 --> 02:53:50,380
I think he's so cute.

3018
02:53:50,380 --> 02:53:51,380
He is a cutie pie.

3019
02:53:51,380 --> 02:53:53,380
Oh, floppy hair glasses.

3020
02:53:53,380 --> 02:53:56,380
Like, floppy hair glasses.

3021
02:53:56,380 --> 02:54:00,380
Oh, but right now, the love of my life.

3022
02:54:00,380 --> 02:54:04,380
Right now, the love of my life is Chilchuk from Dungeon Meshie.

3023
02:54:04,380 --> 02:54:05,380
I'm so in love with him.

3024
02:54:05,380 --> 02:54:07,380
You're, what a weirdo you are.

3025
02:54:07,380 --> 02:54:09,380
You got me here.

3026
02:54:09,380 --> 02:54:10,380
I'm trying to think.

3027
02:54:10,380 --> 02:54:14,380
I haven't, I haven't been watching a lot of, like, animated stuff lately.

3028
02:54:14,380 --> 02:54:17,380
I've, I've, I've been watching, like, the boys.

3029
02:54:17,380 --> 02:54:18,380
Nice.

3030
02:54:18,380 --> 02:54:19,380
Chilchuk, too.

3031
02:54:19,380 --> 02:54:24,380
I like, I like guys with blue, spiky hair.

3032
02:54:24,380 --> 02:54:25,380
What?

3033
02:54:25,380 --> 02:54:26,380
Sonic?

3034
02:54:26,380 --> 02:54:27,380
I'm like.

3035
02:54:27,380 --> 02:54:28,380
Oh, yeah, that's right.

3036
02:54:28,380 --> 02:54:29,380
You like Sonic.

3037
02:54:29,380 --> 02:54:30,380
Red shoes.

3038
02:54:30,380 --> 02:54:31,380
Sonic?

3039
02:54:31,380 --> 02:54:32,380
Yeah.

3040
02:54:32,380 --> 02:54:33,380
Oh, my gosh.

3041
02:54:33,380 --> 02:54:35,380
I mean, like, that's just, like, one, you know.

3042
02:54:35,380 --> 02:54:37,380
He doesn't have to be Sonic.

3043
02:54:37,380 --> 02:54:39,380
I don't care if he's Mary.

3044
02:54:39,380 --> 02:54:42,380
He's going to, we're going to, he likes blonde hair.

3045
02:54:42,380 --> 02:54:43,380
She's the other one.

3046
02:54:43,380 --> 02:54:47,380
I'm going to dye my hair blonde and he's going to fall in love with me.

3047
02:54:47,380 --> 02:54:49,380
I will, I will be married to Chilchuk.

3048
02:54:49,380 --> 02:54:51,380
Wait, who likes blonde?

3049
02:54:51,380 --> 02:54:53,380
Chilchuk Tim's likes blonde women.

3050
02:54:53,380 --> 02:54:54,380
Chibi and Johnny Bravo.

3051
02:54:54,380 --> 02:54:56,380
You know, I would approve that.

3052
02:54:56,380 --> 02:54:57,380
Johnny?

3053
02:54:57,380 --> 02:54:58,380
Yeah, that works.

3054
02:54:58,380 --> 02:55:00,380
Johnny Bravo.

3055
02:55:00,380 --> 02:55:01,380
Oh.

3056
02:55:01,380 --> 02:55:02,380
Who would they choose me?

3057
02:55:02,380 --> 02:55:03,380
Who would they pick me?

3058
02:55:03,380 --> 02:55:04,380
Who would they pick me?

3059
02:55:04,380 --> 02:55:06,380
Who would you, who would you ship with Chai?

3060
02:55:06,380 --> 02:55:07,380
Who would you ship with?

3061
02:55:07,380 --> 02:55:10,380
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I.

3062
02:55:10,380 --> 02:55:11,380
What the fuck?

3063
02:55:11,380 --> 02:55:12,380
She broke.

3064
02:55:12,380 --> 02:55:16,380
I just wanted to, like, give them something to, like, inspire them.

3065
02:55:16,380 --> 02:55:20,380
Wait, are you saying Poe from Kung Fu Panda for me?

3066
02:55:20,380 --> 02:55:23,380
Because he's funny and makes food, you know, honestly.

3067
02:55:23,380 --> 02:55:27,380
Johnny Bravo is my Chibi, absolutely.

3068
02:55:27,380 --> 02:55:29,380
Yeah, I see Johnny Bravo.

3069
02:55:29,380 --> 02:55:30,380
I do see that.

3070
02:55:30,380 --> 02:55:32,380
Yeah, me and Johnny Bravo.

3071
02:55:32,380 --> 02:55:40,380
Do you know the guy that plays the Riddler in, in the Batman, in the 2020 Batman movie?

3072
02:55:40,380 --> 02:55:41,380
Yeah.

3073
02:55:41,380 --> 02:55:43,380
This is weirdly specific.

3074
02:55:43,380 --> 02:55:44,380
Yes.

3075
02:55:44,380 --> 02:55:45,380
With Robert Pattison.

3076
02:55:45,380 --> 02:55:46,380
You know, no.

3077
02:55:46,380 --> 02:55:50,380
Paul, they know, but when he's specific with the Riddler.

3078
02:55:50,380 --> 02:55:51,380
What the fuck is his name?

3079
02:55:51,380 --> 02:55:52,380
I'm really into him.

3080
02:55:52,380 --> 02:55:55,380
I think Robert Pattison was sexy in that one.

3081
02:55:55,380 --> 02:55:56,380
Chibi X-Bugs Bunny.

3082
02:55:56,380 --> 02:55:59,380
No, that's, that's bad.

3083
02:55:59,380 --> 02:56:01,380
He's possibly my father.

3084
02:56:01,380 --> 02:56:02,380
Wow.

3085
02:56:02,380 --> 02:56:03,380
Oh, wait.

3086
02:56:03,380 --> 02:56:04,380
Oh.

3087
02:56:04,380 --> 02:56:05,380
What's your dad?

3088
02:56:05,380 --> 02:56:10,380
I'm also, I'm canonically related to every bunny character in pop culture.

3089
02:56:10,380 --> 02:56:11,380
Oh.

3090
02:56:11,380 --> 02:56:13,380
Yeah, Paul Dano is, I know.

3091
02:56:13,380 --> 02:56:14,380
Peter Rabbit.

3092
02:56:14,380 --> 02:56:15,380
He's, he's something.

3093
02:56:15,380 --> 02:56:18,380
I also like crazy fucked up characters.

3094
02:56:18,380 --> 02:56:20,380
So that's why I fucking.

3095
02:56:20,380 --> 02:56:21,380
Omelette?

3096
02:56:21,380 --> 02:56:23,380
I, yeah, I had a thing for.

3097
02:56:23,380 --> 02:56:24,380
Omelette?

3098
02:56:24,380 --> 02:56:26,380
Yeah, I figure it doesn't much.

3099
02:56:26,380 --> 02:56:28,380
Would you let him drink your Chichi's milk?

3100
02:56:28,380 --> 02:56:29,380
Yeah.

3101
02:56:29,380 --> 02:56:31,380
I milk him from a Zura.

3102
02:56:31,380 --> 02:56:32,380
Homelander?

3103
02:56:32,380 --> 02:56:34,380
First season homelander.

3104
02:56:34,380 --> 02:56:36,380
I don't, not, not later seasons.

3105
02:56:36,380 --> 02:56:39,380
Well, I'm a homelander.

3106
02:56:39,380 --> 02:56:44,380
Oh no, Chibi, not homelander.

3107
02:56:44,380 --> 02:56:48,380
I don't, I think it's like the, I can fix him thing.

3108
02:56:48,380 --> 02:56:50,380
Like, I'm like, oh, I let me mother you.

3109
02:56:50,380 --> 02:56:52,380
Like, I just want to take care of you.

3110
02:56:52,380 --> 02:56:56,380
Like, I like, I like to fix people.

3111
02:56:56,380 --> 02:56:57,380
I'm a fixer.

3112
02:56:57,380 --> 02:56:58,380
I have to stop watching it.

3113
02:56:58,380 --> 02:57:02,380
Cause I think once I saw the deep ass cheeks, I like tabbed out my brain.

3114
02:57:02,380 --> 02:57:06,380
Wait, I need to know more.

3115
02:57:06,380 --> 02:57:07,380
Tell me more.

3116
02:57:07,380 --> 02:57:13,380
So the boys has a lot of nudity and there was one time he like makes a person blow him

3117
02:57:13,380 --> 02:57:20,380
and then my, my, my mommy, my mommy walked into my room and then she walks in, his butt

3118
02:57:20,380 --> 02:57:27,380
she's on my screen and I just felt ashamed.

3119
02:57:27,380 --> 02:57:31,380
Yes, I would be Omniman's little pet.

3120
02:57:31,380 --> 02:57:33,380
Yeah, I bet you were, you freak.

3121
02:57:33,380 --> 02:57:36,380
I'll have another rare crush, but it's like from a really specific movie.

3122
02:57:36,380 --> 02:57:41,380
And it's like the way that what happens to the character is very bad.

3123
02:57:41,380 --> 02:57:43,380
The fucked up characters.

3124
02:57:43,380 --> 02:57:44,380
Yeah.

3125
02:57:44,380 --> 02:57:45,380
Nori at turbo.

3126
02:57:45,380 --> 02:57:47,380
Oh, I see that.

3127
02:57:47,380 --> 02:57:48,380
The snail.

3128
02:57:48,380 --> 02:57:51,380
I love that movie.

3129
02:57:51,380 --> 02:57:56,380
Herbie from Herbie fully loaded for a second.

3130
02:57:56,380 --> 02:57:57,380
Car.

3131
02:57:57,380 --> 02:58:00,380
I love, I love, I love turbo the movie.

3132
02:58:00,380 --> 02:58:01,380
That's a great movie.

3133
02:58:01,380 --> 02:58:02,380
I love YouTubers.

3134
02:58:02,380 --> 02:58:03,380
That's true.

3135
02:58:03,380 --> 02:58:07,380
Maybe I can get John Cena to follow me and I can, you know, hang out with Peacemaker.

3136
02:58:07,380 --> 02:58:08,380
Mmm.

3137
02:58:08,380 --> 02:58:09,380
Mmm.

3138
02:58:09,380 --> 02:58:11,380
I don't know what that means.

3139
02:58:11,380 --> 02:58:13,380
Oh, Chi X Hiccup.

3140
02:58:13,380 --> 02:58:14,380
That's pretty good.

3141
02:58:14,380 --> 02:58:15,380
Oh my.

3142
02:58:15,380 --> 02:58:17,380
I think Hiccup is so cute.

3143
02:58:17,380 --> 02:58:18,380
I didn't give it a go.

3144
02:58:18,380 --> 02:58:19,380
Hiccup is so cute.

3145
02:58:19,380 --> 02:58:21,380
I love how to train your dragon.

3146
02:58:21,380 --> 02:58:22,380
Yeah.

3147
02:58:22,380 --> 02:58:23,380
That's so like specific.

3148
02:58:23,380 --> 02:58:26,380
I feel like guys are fucked up teeth are so cute to me.

3149
02:58:26,380 --> 02:58:27,380
I don't know what that's.

3150
02:58:27,380 --> 02:58:28,380
I think that's exactly my type.

3151
02:58:28,380 --> 02:58:29,380
Like tall.

3152
02:58:29,380 --> 02:58:30,380
Why not?

3153
02:58:30,380 --> 02:58:34,380
To be a big ears and messy hair.

3154
02:58:34,380 --> 02:58:38,380
I like mentally ill or deep and brooding.

3155
02:58:38,380 --> 02:58:41,380
And that's why I had a huge crush on Robin.

3156
02:58:41,380 --> 02:58:42,380
Yeah.

3157
02:58:42,380 --> 02:58:46,380
I like either really like fucked up mentally ill guys are like guys that literally look

3158
02:58:46,380 --> 02:58:47,380
like they're like crack head teeth.

3159
02:58:47,380 --> 02:58:48,380
Yeah.

3160
02:58:48,380 --> 02:58:49,380
I don't know.

3161
02:58:49,380 --> 02:58:50,380
It just gets me going.

3162
02:58:50,380 --> 02:58:51,380
You guys.

3163
02:58:51,380 --> 02:58:53,380
Who's your ideal man?

3164
02:58:53,380 --> 02:58:54,380
Chi.

3165
02:58:54,380 --> 02:58:58,380
Which is your favorite trope that you're attracted to?

3166
02:58:58,380 --> 02:59:07,380
Um, charismatic and like, um, really fast.

3167
02:59:07,380 --> 02:59:08,380
Okay.

3168
02:59:08,380 --> 02:59:09,380
Okay.

3169
02:59:09,380 --> 02:59:10,380
Let me think.

3170
02:59:10,380 --> 02:59:11,380
I don't even know you guys.

3171
02:59:11,380 --> 02:59:12,380
It's okay.

3172
02:59:12,380 --> 02:59:13,380
You can just keep saying Sonic.

3173
02:59:13,380 --> 02:59:14,380
It's okay.

3174
02:59:14,380 --> 02:59:16,380
But I will be on my stand completely.

3175
02:59:16,380 --> 02:59:19,380
100%.

3176
02:59:19,380 --> 02:59:22,380
Nori X fish legs.

3177
02:59:22,380 --> 02:59:24,380
No, it's just.

3178
02:59:24,380 --> 02:59:27,380
I do like British accents.

3179
02:59:27,380 --> 02:59:28,380
Not Batman.

3180
02:59:28,380 --> 02:59:31,380
I like Robert Pattinson's Batman.

3181
02:59:31,380 --> 02:59:32,380
He was good.

3182
02:59:32,380 --> 02:59:34,380
I think, I think realistically.

3183
02:59:34,380 --> 02:59:35,380
I don't know.

3184
02:59:35,380 --> 02:59:36,380
Really.

3185
02:59:36,380 --> 02:59:39,380
Actually, I lied about why it could be any skin color.

3186
02:59:39,380 --> 02:59:40,380
Yeah.

3187
02:59:40,380 --> 02:59:41,380
Fucked up teeth and big ears.

3188
02:59:41,380 --> 02:59:42,380
I'm kind of into it.

3189
02:59:42,380 --> 02:59:45,380
But then my first question is super deep.

3190
02:59:45,380 --> 02:59:46,380
I don't know.

3191
02:59:46,380 --> 02:59:49,380
My first cartoon crush was the cat baron from the cat returns.

3192
02:59:49,380 --> 02:59:52,380
And then I fell in love with howl from howl's we've been castles.

3193
02:59:52,380 --> 02:59:54,380
So I don't know what that means about me.

3194
02:59:54,380 --> 02:59:56,380
What does that even mean about you?

3195
02:59:56,380 --> 02:59:57,380
I don't know.

3196
02:59:57,380 --> 02:59:58,380
I'm sorry.

3197
02:59:58,380 --> 02:59:59,380
I'm sorry.

3198
02:59:59,380 --> 03:00:00,380
Let me look it up.

3199
03:00:00,380 --> 03:00:01,380
Cat Baron.

3200
03:00:01,380 --> 03:00:02,380
Can you spell that for me?

3201
03:00:02,380 --> 03:00:03,380
I'm so sorry.

3202
03:00:04,380 --> 03:00:05,380
Cartman?

3203
03:00:05,380 --> 03:00:06,380
Okay.

3204
03:00:06,380 --> 03:00:07,380
Okay?

3205
03:00:07,380 --> 03:00:08,380
Sorry.

3206
03:00:08,380 --> 03:00:09,380
I just, I don't understand.

3207
03:00:09,380 --> 03:00:10,380
Oh.

3208
03:00:10,380 --> 03:00:12,380
Oh, what the fuck?

3209
03:00:12,380 --> 03:00:15,380
Wait, I kind of to add that.

3210
03:00:15,380 --> 03:00:16,380
Yeah.

3211
03:00:16,380 --> 03:00:17,380
Right?

3212
03:00:17,380 --> 03:00:18,380
He's just like a gthon男.

3213
03:00:18,380 --> 03:00:19,380
No.

3214
03:00:19,380 --> 03:00:20,380
No.

3215
03:00:20,380 --> 03:00:21,380
Yeah.

3216
03:00:21,380 --> 03:00:22,380
I don't understand.

3217
03:00:22,380 --> 03:00:31,380
And then...

3218
03:00:31,380 --> 03:00:38,300
of liking. Do you guys ever watch? I really liked the Bolton, what the fuck is

3219
03:00:38,300 --> 03:00:43,500
his name? Bolton character from Game of Thrones that just fucking tortured people.

3220
03:00:43,500 --> 03:00:54,220
I thought he was Hoss. Fuck. I liked Joffrey. You liked Joffrey? Yeah. Okay.

3221
03:00:54,220 --> 03:00:57,580
I don't know what's happening. Yes, I like Ramsay, but I also liked him in Skins too,

3222
03:00:57,580 --> 03:01:03,820
so that's. Did you guys ever watch Little Bear? Little Bear? A movie with the two

3223
03:01:03,820 --> 03:01:07,980
bear brothers where they turn into bears. That's a brother bear. Oh, that's a brother bear?

3224
03:01:07,980 --> 03:01:11,860
Oh, I'm fucking restarted. I definitely had a crush on the bear, the older brother.

3225
03:01:11,860 --> 03:01:20,260
Oh, no, Chai wasn't a lie for this. What do you mean, shame? Don't shame me. Listen,

3226
03:01:21,220 --> 03:01:30,940
I think my first was like a little kid. It was Jake from Jake and the Neverland Pirates.

3227
03:01:30,940 --> 03:01:37,700
That's a child shell. Oh, that's cute. And I was my first crush. And then my most recent

3228
03:01:37,700 --> 03:01:46,700
crush is Chuchuch Tim's. I think my first human crush was Peter from Peter Pan, but like when

3229
03:01:46,700 --> 03:01:54,660
he was from Family Guy. No, the live action Peter Pan. Yes, with the kid with the freckles.

3230
03:01:54,660 --> 03:02:02,260
Yeah, he was cute. I don't know. I feel like I didn't have any like fictional crushes.

3231
03:02:02,260 --> 03:02:08,180
Except for Sonic. Oh, yeah, maybe I'm just very much. Oh, Jeremy Sumpter. Oh, yeah.

3232
03:02:09,180 --> 03:02:20,300
Wait, what's that word? Misogynist. I liked. Do you guys know Papyrus from Undertale?

3233
03:02:20,300 --> 03:02:28,060
Oh, I should Papyrus extends. I don't know what the fuck is wrong. Why am I saying this? No,

3235
03:02:35,340 --> 03:02:42,140
Papyrus. Turning into Sean Connery. Honestly, I see it. I understand. I like I like a guy

3236
03:02:42,140 --> 03:02:51,660
who likes puzzles and tries to keep me entertained. I like the guy from the cow from Barnyard.

3237
03:02:51,660 --> 03:03:01,380
Otis. Yeah, Otis. I know my jaw drop actually my jaw drop. Our trans icon because he's a male cow

3238
03:03:01,380 --> 03:03:10,540
with otters. Oh, yeah, what is she? That's the joke. People just kept running with it.

3239
03:03:10,540 --> 03:03:20,420
I'm trying to think. Or is my like non human crush. I'm trying to think. Non human. You

3241
03:03:29,340 --> 03:03:35,060
the twin green. I guess I like twins. Maybe it's my Gemini moon. What the fuck? Non human.

3242
03:03:35,060 --> 03:03:47,380
Non human characters that are hot. I'm still trying to think. I don't know. I had too much of a

3243
03:03:47,380 --> 03:03:54,740
grind set. I didn't have time for crushes. Okay, I can think. I remember now. Bumblebee from

3244
03:03:54,740 --> 03:04:00,660
Transformers. Bumblebee from Transformers. And then when he spoke, when he spoke, I was really

3245
03:04:00,660 --> 03:04:15,020
into it. And then I really had a huge crush on Godzilla. I thought Godzilla was so cool. Spirit

3246
03:04:15,020 --> 03:04:23,100
the horse. Yes. Oh, yes. Yeah. Spirit that was Spanish. It was so sexy. I will lie. Yeah,

3247
03:04:23,140 --> 03:04:33,460
that's that's literally the whole movie. That's a seductive horse. And Balto from Balto. I don't

3248
03:04:33,460 --> 03:04:47,180
know man. You guys are weird. You didn't think this horse from Spirit is hot. Yeah. I don't

3249
03:04:47,180 --> 03:04:55,580
even know what that is. You never watched Spirit recently. I think it was a horse girl. Neither

3250
03:04:55,580 --> 03:05:00,580
was I, but I watched. Wait, show me. Show me him. Okay, that's him. Oh, there you go.

3251
03:05:00,580 --> 03:05:14,180
Long hair. Yes. Yes. Men with long hair. I think I just like incels. I'm thinking about it more.

3252
03:05:14,180 --> 03:05:25,980
I like I like incels and my old fat men. Yeah, I got a wide range. Yeah, I like a pretty wide

3253
03:05:25,980 --> 03:05:36,780
range. But if you're like a person, I don't know what my type is. Maybe guys like Sonic. I just

3254
03:05:36,780 --> 03:05:46,260
watched you put spirit. Watch them appear on the screen. You just corrupt the child image. One

3255
03:05:46,260 --> 03:05:53,820
gift was all it took. Spirit is a very charismatic horse. Yeah. And then we were like a horse. I

3256
03:05:53,820 --> 03:05:58,500
felt like I was being flirted with. No, it wasn't the size difference or the power. I think it was

3257
03:05:58,500 --> 03:06:10,780
Godzilla's like swag. I was like, holy shit. All of them. I have a problem. Oh, wait, no. And

3258
03:06:10,780 --> 03:06:17,300
my action I lied. My first human crush was one of the monsters in Power Rangers in Power Rangers

3259
03:06:17,300 --> 03:06:23,140
Samurai. I remember which one I just know is Power Rangers Samurai. I fucking I would do it with

3260
03:06:23,140 --> 03:06:28,100
show about Power Rangers. Every time I feel like I'm on screen, I was like, oh, yeah, this is

3261
03:06:28,100 --> 03:06:33,820
hot. I used to have a really big crush on Zuko too. I think everyone does. That's just basic. That's

3262
03:06:33,820 --> 03:06:45,780
basic. Yeah, it's pretty basic. That's my basic one. What about Uncle Irel? Am I right? I agree. No,

3263
03:06:46,260 --> 03:06:56,100
honestly would. No, I'm kidding. This is a safe space. Try. No judgment here. Try. Oh, yeah,

3264
03:06:56,100 --> 03:07:03,780
right. I don't even think she be kind to you. Um, not in the place. Oh, the cucumber from

3265
03:07:03,780 --> 03:07:12,660
Veggie Tales. No. Veggie Tales. I was forced to watch Veggie Tales. I didn't like Veggie

3266
03:07:12,660 --> 03:07:21,860
Tales. I have to watch it. I could watch it to learn English. That's a great show to watch to

3267
03:07:21,860 --> 03:07:22,820
learn English.

3268
03:07:22,820 --> 03:07:26,820
I don't know.

3269
03:07:26,820 --> 03:07:38,260
Iro in his prime. Buff Iro in jail. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah. Guilf, Guilf. 100%.

3270
03:07:38,260 --> 03:07:45,460
You guys are just listing off basically every character now. Not all. Not all. Not all.

3271
03:07:46,100 --> 03:07:53,540
Do you guys remember that movie Meet the Robinsons? Yes. Oh, the like black hair. Black hair? Yeah.

3272
03:07:56,500 --> 03:08:03,780
Okay, yeah, that's actually kind of real. I had a crush on Goob, the evil guy. I had a crush on

3273
03:08:03,780 --> 03:08:10,580
the evil guy. Oh, I had a crush on, um, what's his face? The enemy and the Incredibles?

3274
03:08:11,540 --> 03:08:19,700
And what was his name? Central? Yeah. Yeah. I had a crush on Goob, the white hair lady. You

3275
03:08:19,700 --> 03:08:24,500
remind me of the white hair lady. I remind you of the white haired lady? Yeah, I think she's really

3276
03:08:24,500 --> 03:08:31,940
pretty. Oh, you are like her. You are like her. Um, Goob when he was older, so like when he was

3277
03:08:31,940 --> 03:08:39,380
like all hunchbacked and like dirty looking and yeah. I like the one slur, but I think that was

3278
03:08:39,380 --> 03:08:44,980
pretty basic. No, no, that's a pretty, that's a pretty. I totally get it though. Like it makes

3279
03:08:44,980 --> 03:08:54,900
sense. Yeah. Mirage. Yeah, he's reminded Mirage. I don't know. I think it's the lowering appeal

3280
03:08:55,620 --> 03:09:00,180
with her. I don't know. I think, I think if I'm like trying to like,

3281
03:09:00,180 --> 03:09:08,980
hmm, it'd be like, oh, I'm, I'm kind of bad, but I'm, I'm like protective.

3282
03:09:10,100 --> 03:09:16,100
Like I'm like, I'm strong and I'm powerful. Yeah, maybe bad boy. Maybe like Draco mouth.

3283
03:09:19,220 --> 03:09:23,620
But it's like, but it's like, oh, but, but like for the one I love, I'm like soft and

3284
03:09:23,620 --> 03:09:34,500
protective and sweet. You know? Oh, so like Edward from Twilight. Oh, but no, not really. I

3285
03:09:34,500 --> 03:09:44,580
don't feel anything. I feel nothing. Quasimodo. Nori, people want to know if you like Quasimodo.

3286
03:09:46,020 --> 03:09:53,060
Quasimodo. From hunchback of Notre Dame. Um, I like the old man. Sorry. You like the old man?

3287
03:09:53,060 --> 03:09:57,060
I was, I liked the gypsy girl. I can't remember her name. Was it Esmeralda?

3288
03:09:57,060 --> 03:10:01,060
Okay. Cause I, okay. I wasn't in Spanish, right? Okay. I wasn't in Spanish, right? So in Spanish,

3289
03:10:01,060 --> 03:10:07,460
I have seen the Spanish version. I would get so. The voice actor was crazy for Spanish.

3290
03:10:07,460 --> 03:10:14,660
He just sounded so good. So I kind of just like fumbled everything. And I'm also like,

3291
03:10:14,660 --> 03:10:20,340
I'm kind of religious. So religious man, evil religious man. I was like, oh, this is amazing.

3292
03:10:21,300 --> 03:10:27,780
The creepy priest. Younger, little meaner than what I wanted. And I wanted the creepy old looking

3293
03:10:27,780 --> 03:10:37,940

3294
03:10:37,940 --> 03:10:47,300
of Notre Dame. Frollo, hunchback. Sakuna, like, well, that's like basic. Yeah, like, yeah, he's hot.

3295
03:10:47,300 --> 03:10:49,780
But like, we're trying to get to the fucked up ones, you know?

3296
03:10:52,100 --> 03:11:02,900
Oh, um, Pennywise. Pennywise? Pennywise? What was, what was the thingy from

3297
03:11:02,900 --> 03:11:09,380
I like the actor. The Demi Gorgon, but I never watched anything. So it was just the Demi Gorgon.

3298
03:11:09,380 --> 03:11:13,860
I've seen a bad dragon dildo of the Demi Gorgon. What? I don't even want to know what that is.

3299
03:11:13,860 --> 03:11:16,900
I don't want to know. I don't know what that is. I don't know what that is. You're not gonna

3301
03:11:26,900 --> 03:11:34,260
Oh my god. I feel like such a lame-o. Oh my god. Come on. Come on. You're even sexy even. Stranger

03:11:34,260 --> 03:11:44,100
wrongs. No, don't curl chai. I just want to watch it. Don't curl chai. I want it.

3303
03:11:46,980 --> 03:11:53,460
I don't think this is gonna make any sense, but I did have, I do can recall that I had a big crush

3304
03:11:53,460 --> 03:12:07,460
on this cat. This cat? Get that out of my DMs right now. Get that out of my DMs right now.

03:12:16,100 --> 03:12:21,540
you no. I don't want to see it. What cat? Let's just change the subject. Now what kind of

3307
03:12:21,540 --> 03:12:28,100
you sick bastard? No, she's my friend. She's my friend. She's my friend. She's my friend.

3308
03:12:28,100 --> 03:12:37,620
Why is she your friend? Why is she your friend? Is that the cat from Franklin? No, this is a cat from

3309
03:12:37,620 --> 03:12:45,380
Little Bear. Oh, oh. That's not Little Bear. Chai. Chai. Why is it cat?

3310
03:12:47,300 --> 03:12:52,820
It was more, I think that's a thing. I think it's personality. I think I don't have a physical

3311
03:12:52,820 --> 03:12:58,100
type. I think that's the problem. They could be a cat. They could be a cow. They could be a cucumber.

3312
03:12:58,820 --> 03:13:00,820
Do you know the dog from Lady and the Tramp?

3313
03:13:01,780 --> 03:13:07,460
Uh, yeah. I had a question. The dog, like the lady's love interest, I don't know.

3314
03:13:09,140 --> 03:13:13,460
He went to do everything to be with her, man. I kind of liked it. Wait, what dog? Oh,

3315
03:13:13,460 --> 03:13:18,020
Bolts? The dog from Lady and the Tramp. Oh, I thought, sorry, I thought you meant Bolts.

3316
03:13:19,220 --> 03:13:26,740
Oh, but yes. Uh, Tramp, yeah. I thought he was very attractive. And he loved Lady very much,

3317
03:13:26,980 --> 03:13:33,940
yes. Oh, yeah. Very cute. There's the pure love that I like. Yeah, they were, like,

3318
03:13:33,940 --> 03:13:40,660
different classes. It was very adorable. Now I'm a sucker for the Juliet, Romeo and Juliet type

3319
03:13:40,660 --> 03:13:50,740
of trope. Someone's a sucker for that. I love there so much. Someone said bubble baths from Spongebob.

3320
03:13:51,540 --> 03:13:56,900
No. No, no, no, no. Okay. Who do you like from Spongebob?

3321
03:13:58,660 --> 03:14:04,100
I like the guy in the Spongebob movie that was like the bounty hunter that was hunting them down

3322
03:14:04,100 --> 03:14:08,580
with the really nice boots. Oh, yeah. I forgot about him.

3323
03:14:11,220 --> 03:14:17,540
Dennis, yeah. I didn't have a crush on the Spongebob characters. I was ship in Spongebob.

3324
03:14:17,780 --> 03:14:24,180
We were just ship in them. Maybe the robot lady, the wife. Oh, Karen?

3325
03:14:24,180 --> 03:14:29,940
Karen, yeah. I like the wife. David Hasselhoff. I don't know. David Hasselhoff.

3326
03:14:29,940 --> 03:14:34,020
There hasn't been like, oh, what anime characters do you guys resonate with? Like, what kind of,

3327
03:14:34,020 --> 03:14:38,500
like, oh, this is so- Do I kid? Yeah, like, who do you kid? Who do you guys see? Who do you guys

3328
03:14:38,500 --> 03:14:46,420
kid? Who's your kid? Who's your kid? Who's your kid? I haven't kidned a anime character in a very long

3329
03:14:46,420 --> 03:14:52,500
time. And I usually watch my first kid. I think my, my head always goes to tiger,

3330
03:14:52,500 --> 03:15:01,460
icica, icica, icica, icica, icica. Icicle, yeah. Icicle, tiger. Like, that's like always,

3331
03:15:01,460 --> 03:15:09,700
I can't, it's like uncontrollable, but I think like Toru, Toru Honda.

3332
03:15:10,260 --> 03:15:21,380
I'd have to think about mine. Yeah, I have to think. I couldn't really like kid myself,

3333
03:15:21,380 --> 03:15:25,940
because I have to, I feel like I have to relate to a character, and I don't really feel like I

3334
03:15:25,940 --> 03:15:30,580
really relate it, especially with the anime I watched. I usually used anime as a form of

3335
03:15:30,580 --> 03:15:36,980
escapism. I didn't want anything to remind me of my life. Oh, that, yeah. I usually watch like

3336
03:15:36,980 --> 03:15:42,260
super, I never watched like slice of life stuff. I watched like super high fantasy stuff, or like

3337
03:15:42,260 --> 03:15:49,780
sci-fi, or just like fucking, I was just watching Naruto and Full Metal Alchemist and all the time,

3338
03:15:49,780 --> 03:15:59,940
and I like, yeah, I can't. Oh, I liked Alphonse from Full Metal Alchemist. Is that your kid?

3339
03:15:59,940 --> 03:16:05,940
Suit of armor. No, he's not my kin, but like, I liked him. Oh, you liked him? Oh, okay.

3340
03:16:05,940 --> 03:16:11,540
Suki from Avatar, who I want to be. Oh yeah, I feel that. I don't know. I don't know who I can,

3341
03:16:11,540 --> 03:16:17,140
I'm not gonna say it all out though. I thought you guys would answer too. Is it like a weird? I don't

3342
03:16:17,140 --> 03:16:21,540
know if I have any like weird ones. I think most of them are like pretty, pretty, like sound like

3343
03:16:21,540 --> 03:16:32,900
pretty like normal. Um, I'm gonna keep her to myself. She's your, your anime Oshii. Um, let me see.

3344
03:16:37,780 --> 03:16:43,860
Oh my god. What is it, kin? It's just like a, it's a nerd term to me. I can't do like super

3345
03:16:44,100 --> 03:16:49,220
really, too. You're like, oh, this is me and I am them. They are me. We are one. We are Venom.

3346
03:16:50,180 --> 03:16:58,100
Of course, I'm Venom. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. What's the tongue do? No, no, not the tongue. It wasn't

3347
03:16:58,100 --> 03:17:02,820
the tongue. It was just the fact that he was like a symbiote. Yeah. And I was like, what would he

3348
03:17:02,820 --> 03:17:09,380
feel like if he was inside of me, but not like in a weird way and like, in like a, like in a symbiote

3349
03:17:09,460 --> 03:17:15,620
suit kind of way. Okay. I think, I think I actually might have kin death the kid.

3350
03:17:17,300 --> 03:17:23,620
Yes, yes, yes. Wait, me too, me too, me too. Because I have OCD and so I like really related

3351
03:17:23,620 --> 03:17:29,380
with this character because for obsession with symmetry and stuff. Yeah. Oh, I fucking love

3352
03:17:29,380 --> 03:17:35,460
Solator. Solator was my shit. I had so many OCs. I was very much obsessed with that the kid. I think

3353
03:17:35,460 --> 03:17:39,780
I related to him a lot. Yeah, I want to say that. It's like, I can always, I was like,

3354
03:17:39,780 --> 03:17:44,820
I feel like it's like, I like a character so much I want to be them or like, I'm like, that's so me.

3355
03:17:44,820 --> 03:17:49,860
Yeah. So me for real, for real. That's so me. That's me for real. Let's be for real. Let's be for

3356
03:17:49,860 --> 03:17:58,260
real. I can the dune worm. What the fuck are you doing? What's dune? You don't know what dune is?

3357
03:17:58,980 --> 03:18:04,580
No. It's a book. It's a sci-fi book. I don't know if you, I don't think you would like it at all

3358
03:18:04,580 --> 03:18:11,540
actually or even the movie. I don't only think it's your thing. Nope. Yeah. I like that. Also,

3359
03:18:11,540 --> 03:18:17,540
I don't even know how to read properly. I think I'm like genuinely dyslexic. So that's okay. Oh,

3360
03:18:17,540 --> 03:18:24,580
I know what my, my first, my first kid where I was like, really obsessed with the character and I

3361
03:18:24,580 --> 03:18:29,940
was like, Oh my God, I want that to be me so bad. I wanted it to be me. It was Asuna from Sword Art

3362
03:18:29,940 --> 03:18:37,780
on the line. Oh, I feel it. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mine's with, mine's with Sasuke. Oh, really? Okay.

3363
03:18:37,780 --> 03:18:43,460
Yeah, that's good. Mine's with Sasuke. I'm on the line. What was an anime you wish you were in the

3364
03:18:43,460 --> 03:18:50,180
world in? Like, like, sword art, sword art. Yeah. Mine was, I don't really think it was an anime,

3365
03:18:50,180 --> 03:18:56,500
but I really wish I was in Code Lyoko. Wait, what's that? You don't know what Code Lyoko is? Am I,

3366
03:18:56,740 --> 03:19:03,780
I don't know. So Code Lyoko is this show where these kids go to like school,

3367
03:19:03,780 --> 03:19:08,020
but then there's this like this master computer that like tries to fucking kill them every day.

3368
03:19:08,020 --> 03:19:13,620
Why are there four heads so big? Yeah, they fucking use four heads. But they go into the computer to

3369
03:19:13,620 --> 03:19:20,500
fight, like it's like reset time. And so they just reset time all the time. I just fucking love Code

3370
03:19:20,500 --> 03:19:26,260
Lyoko. That was my shit. Wait, someone says I don't blame TV. I can understand that. I wanted to,

3371
03:19:26,260 --> 03:19:33,380
I, odd, odd was my, oh, I fucking was in love with odd, which was like the cat, the cat boy.

3372
03:19:34,740 --> 03:19:38,980
Oh, wait, I want to look it up now. How do you spell it? It was a really weird

3373
03:19:40,340 --> 03:19:48,580
art style, but yeah, Code Lyoko Ly, okay. Code Lyoko is French. Yes, it's originally French.

3374
03:19:48,580 --> 03:19:55,460
It's so interesting. But I love Bible Villaco. The thing that I wanted to be in, I'm trying to think.

3375
03:19:55,460 --> 03:20:02,100
I wanted to be in Code Lyoko and you know Naruto naturally. Either Yvonne Gellor the persona series,

3376
03:20:02,100 --> 03:20:10,980
yeah, yeah. I know I would die though, but um, oh yeah, I don't know, man.

3377
03:20:10,980 --> 03:20:15,980
Corks party, I'm lying, maybe Corks party, you wanna be a Corks party?

3378
03:20:15,980 --> 03:20:20,980
No, you could not, you would die so fast.

3379
03:20:20,980 --> 03:20:22,980
That's terrible.

3380
03:20:22,980 --> 03:20:23,980
Why?

3381
03:20:23,980 --> 03:20:30,980
Because Kauru isn't Eva, and I was obsessed with him.

3382
03:20:30,980 --> 03:20:39,980
But now, I'm gonna have a Corks party, I'm built different, I'm gonna fucking, I'm gonna walk out of there alive, not a scratch on my body.

3383
03:20:39,980 --> 03:20:46,980
I'm already very mentally disturbed.

3384
03:20:46,980 --> 03:20:50,980
Have you done a playthrough of Corks party on your channel?

3385
03:20:50,980 --> 03:20:52,980
Not on my channel, I've played it before though.

3386
03:20:52,980 --> 03:20:56,980
Oh, okay, cause I'm like, let me know when you do, cause I wanna watch it then.

3387
03:20:56,980 --> 03:21:03,980
Yeah, yeah, if I do I'll let you know, but if I was physically there, that little girl, that little girl was getting punted.

3388
03:21:03,980 --> 03:21:05,980
Oh my god.

3389
03:21:06,980 --> 03:21:10,980
Oh man, that'd be fun, aren't there making a two or something I've seen?

3390
03:21:10,980 --> 03:21:13,980
Yeah, they're redoing it, they're making a new game.

3391
03:21:13,980 --> 03:21:23,980
It's the buttered pooper, I totally forgot, cause I made the buttered pooper references before and I forgot it was from Corks party, such a great fucking game.

3392
03:21:23,980 --> 03:21:26,980
And Madfather, I loved all those RPG maker games.

3393
03:21:26,980 --> 03:21:29,980
What is your favorite visual novel, Nori?

3394
03:21:29,980 --> 03:21:31,980
Sorry.

3395
03:21:31,980 --> 03:21:38,980
Mmm.

3396
03:21:38,980 --> 03:21:39,980
What?

3397
03:21:39,980 --> 03:21:42,980
They said nori, they said Nori.

3398
03:21:42,980 --> 03:21:44,980
Oh, don't look it up, maggot beach.

3399
03:21:44,980 --> 03:21:46,980
What?

3400
03:21:46,980 --> 03:21:49,980
Don't look it up, don't do it, there's no better chair.

3401
03:21:49,980 --> 03:21:51,980
I think I've heard of that.

3402
03:21:51,980 --> 03:21:54,980
How do I spell it? Or send it?

3403
03:21:54,980 --> 03:21:56,980
I don't care.

3404
03:21:56,980 --> 03:21:57,980
I want to

3405
03:21:57,980 --> 03:22:02,980
You might not like it, but I won't like it

3406
03:22:02,980 --> 03:22:05,980
A clapjack just said, oh, mega beat

3407
03:22:05,980 --> 03:22:07,980
I've heard of that, what is that?

3408
03:22:07,980 --> 03:22:11,980
But if you want like a normie, a normie taste

3409
03:22:11,980 --> 03:22:13,980
Um, Totono?

3410
03:22:13,980 --> 03:22:15,980
Is it my one of my favorite ones?

3411
03:22:15,980 --> 03:22:17,980
I think it's very beautifully done

3412
03:22:17,980 --> 03:22:19,980
So I really like this one

3413
03:22:20,980 --> 03:22:22,980
Oh, I'm Sayushi! I'm Sayushi!

3414
03:22:22,980 --> 03:22:24,980
Sayushi's also really good

3415
03:22:24,980 --> 03:22:26,980
I'm going to mess up now

3416
03:22:26,980 --> 03:22:28,980
Wait, hold on, raid, raid, moment, raid, moment

3417
03:22:28,980 --> 03:22:29,980
Another one?

3418
03:22:29,980 --> 03:22:30,980
I'll try

3419
03:22:30,980 --> 03:22:32,980
Another one, oh my god, another one

3420
03:22:32,980 --> 03:22:33,980
Give me a second

3421
03:22:33,980 --> 03:22:35,980
She's popular, she's cool

3422
03:22:36,980 --> 03:22:38,980
I put maggot balls on accident

3423
03:22:38,980 --> 03:22:40,980
It's maggot beads

3424
03:22:40,980 --> 03:22:42,980
So it's maggot beads, Totono

3425
03:22:42,980 --> 03:22:43,980
Oh

3426
03:22:43,980 --> 03:22:46,980
And Sayushi is really good too

3427
03:22:47,980 --> 03:22:50,980
The girl's eye is being popped out of its socket

3428
03:22:50,980 --> 03:22:51,980
Yep

3429
03:22:51,980 --> 03:22:53,980
There's titties in this screen

3430
03:22:53,980 --> 03:22:54,980
Yep

3431
03:22:54,980 --> 03:22:55,980
Yep

3432
03:22:55,980 --> 03:22:57,980
What is this, it's like

3433
03:22:59,980 --> 03:23:01,980
Oh, why? I like it so much

3434
03:23:01,980 --> 03:23:03,980
I think it's just maybe like the art

3435
03:23:03,980 --> 03:23:06,980
And stuff is like really like

3436
03:23:06,980 --> 03:23:08,980
Interesting

3437
03:23:09,980 --> 03:23:11,980
I don't know, I'm like, I'm a huge sucker for like

3438
03:23:11,980 --> 03:23:13,980
Very unique art styles, yeah

3439
03:23:13,980 --> 03:23:15,980
Yeah, I'm not averse to like gore

3440
03:23:15,980 --> 03:23:17,980
And just like dark themes

3441
03:23:17,980 --> 03:23:19,980
So I'm actually like, I'm not

3442
03:23:19,980 --> 03:23:22,980
I'm not really a visual novel person

3443
03:23:23,980 --> 03:23:24,980
Really

3444
03:23:24,980 --> 03:23:26,980
You could just watch a play through of it

3445
03:23:26,980 --> 03:23:29,980
Yeah, maybe I might do that

3446
03:23:29,980 --> 03:23:32,980
I usually will just read manga

3447
03:23:32,980 --> 03:23:35,980
But I haven't even read manga in a long time

3448
03:23:35,980 --> 03:23:39,980
Yeah, consuming Japanese media

3449
03:23:39,980 --> 03:23:41,980
Has mostly been for me, just like anime

3450
03:23:41,980 --> 03:23:44,980
But I usually watch normie animes, so

3451
03:23:44,980 --> 03:23:47,980
I would recommend visual novels if you want like a little base tea

3452
03:23:47,980 --> 03:23:48,980
Some of them are pretty simple

3453
03:23:48,980 --> 03:23:50,980
You're just literally just reading and like

3454
03:23:50,980 --> 03:23:51,980
Picking an option

3455
03:23:51,980 --> 03:23:52,980
Yeah, it's like just

3456
03:23:52,980 --> 03:23:54,980
And you can also Google options

3457
03:23:54,980 --> 03:23:56,980
If you just want to like, if you just want to like

3458
03:23:56,980 --> 03:23:58,980
Have a specific ending done

3459
03:23:58,980 --> 03:23:59,980
Things like that

3460
03:24:00,980 --> 03:24:01,980
I think too hard

3461
03:24:01,980 --> 03:24:03,980
What is it?

3462
03:24:03,980 --> 03:24:05,980
Anyone here watched Food Wars?

3463
03:24:05,980 --> 03:24:07,980
Why did you say it like that?

3464
03:24:08,980 --> 03:24:09,980
Never heard of it

3465
03:24:09,980 --> 03:24:11,980
I don't know what you're talking about

3466
03:24:11,980 --> 03:24:12,980
What's Food Wars?

3467
03:24:12,980 --> 03:24:14,980
Yeah, never, yeah, exactly

3468
03:24:14,980 --> 03:24:16,980
Yeah, I actually don't know what that is

3469
03:24:16,980 --> 03:24:17,980
I'm so hurry

3470
03:24:17,980 --> 03:24:18,980
Hi son

3471
03:24:18,980 --> 03:24:20,980
I just told you I like the maggot baits

3472
03:24:20,980 --> 03:24:22,980
Why the fuck would I look at something that's called

3473
03:24:22,980 --> 03:24:24,980
Food Wars?

3474
03:24:24,980 --> 03:24:27,980
Do you think I'm a normal person now buddy?

3475
03:24:27,980 --> 03:24:29,980
I'm like an edged lord

3476
03:24:29,980 --> 03:24:32,980
Call me Sasuke Uchiha

3477
03:24:32,980 --> 03:24:34,980
Noriko Uchiha

3478
03:24:34,980 --> 03:24:36,980
Noriko Uchiha

3479
03:24:36,980 --> 03:24:38,980
Honestly, kind of a badass name

3480
03:24:38,980 --> 03:24:39,980
Yeah, it's my new name now

3481
03:24:39,980 --> 03:24:41,980
I know man, can you re-brand to that?

3482
03:24:41,980 --> 03:24:43,980
Visual novels often have late scenes though

3483
03:24:43,980 --> 03:24:45,980
Yeah, but if you get them through Steam

3484
03:24:45,980 --> 03:24:47,980
You're like centered so hard

3485
03:24:47,980 --> 03:24:49,980
So it doesn't even matter

3486
03:24:49,980 --> 03:24:50,980
I've heard that

3487
03:24:50,980 --> 03:24:52,980
Yeah, the stuff is centered

3488
03:24:52,980 --> 03:24:54,980
Yeah, but visual novels

3489
03:24:54,980 --> 03:24:57,980
I think are very worth to even just look at

3490
03:24:57,980 --> 03:25:00,980
So if you ever want a visual novel recommendation

3491
03:25:00,980 --> 03:25:02,980
I will

3492
03:25:02,980 --> 03:25:04,980
I can look and I'll send you some

3493
03:25:05,980 --> 03:25:06,980
Thank you

3494
03:25:08,980 --> 03:25:11,980
Alright, it is almost 1.30 a.m. for me

3495
03:25:11,980 --> 03:25:13,980
Call me Puppies, yeah it is

3496
03:25:13,980 --> 03:25:15,980
Yeah, I'm Epi

3497
03:25:15,980 --> 03:25:17,980
I'm also really a fucking piss

3498
03:25:17,980 --> 03:25:19,980
I'm waiting for Chyna to come back

3499
03:25:19,980 --> 03:25:20,980
Oh, she's here

3500
03:25:20,980 --> 03:25:21,980
Hi, I'm here, I'm sorry

3501
03:25:21,980 --> 03:25:23,980
I heard you say you're Epi and have to pee

3502
03:25:23,980 --> 03:25:25,980
Yeah, I need to run

3503
03:25:26,980 --> 03:25:28,980
I was hoping you didn't catch that

3504
03:25:28,980 --> 03:25:29,980
Hello

3505
03:25:29,980 --> 03:25:30,980
Hi

3506
03:25:30,980 --> 03:25:32,980
Welcome Raiders

3507
03:25:32,980 --> 03:25:33,980
Wait, Chyna

3508
03:25:33,980 --> 03:25:34,980
Yes, Raiders

3509
03:25:34,980 --> 03:25:35,980
More Raiders?

3510
03:25:35,980 --> 03:25:37,980
Oh no, it's the same

3511
03:25:37,980 --> 03:25:39,980
Yeah, I was saying hi to her Raiders

3512
03:25:39,980 --> 03:25:43,980
Wait Chy, are all the people you put on the stream right now

3513
03:25:43,980 --> 03:25:45,980
People you found attractive?

3514
03:25:45,980 --> 03:25:47,980
No, no, no

3515
03:25:47,980 --> 03:25:52,980
Okay, so the top left is apparently I sound like her

3516
03:25:52,980 --> 03:25:53,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah

3517
03:25:53,980 --> 03:25:56,980
Freeran Shrek, that's just like a visual image

3518
03:25:56,980 --> 03:25:57,980
For everyone to know

3519
03:25:57,980 --> 03:25:59,980
And then that's your crush

3520
03:25:59,980 --> 03:26:01,980
Right there beside them

3521
03:26:01,980 --> 03:26:03,980
And then this is Shibi's crush

3522
03:26:03,980 --> 03:26:06,980
And then it's my crush in front of chat

3523
03:26:06,980 --> 03:26:07,980
Okay, okay, okay

3524
03:26:07,980 --> 03:26:09,980
I'm so curious

3525
03:26:09,980 --> 03:26:12,980
I learned so much about Noriko today

3526
03:26:12,980 --> 03:26:13,980
Yeah

3527
03:26:13,980 --> 03:26:14,980
I'm a pretty open bloke

3528
03:26:14,980 --> 03:26:16,980
We learned so much about each other

3529
03:26:18,980 --> 03:26:21,980
I think we all have very similar but different tastes in movies

3530
03:26:21,980 --> 03:26:22,980
Yes

3531
03:26:22,980 --> 03:26:25,980
And same opinions, but I enjoy that a lot

3532
03:26:25,980 --> 03:26:27,980
Coral is a damn good villain

3533
03:26:28,980 --> 03:26:30,980
Coral is a very good villain

3534
03:26:30,980 --> 03:26:34,980
If you watch the movie, I recommend watching it in Spanish

3535
03:26:34,980 --> 03:26:36,980
It just sounds a lot better

3536
03:26:36,980 --> 03:26:40,980
There's some videos that are just better in Spanish than in English

3537
03:26:42,980 --> 03:26:45,980
Yeah, I think all of them don't chat

3538
03:26:45,980 --> 03:26:48,980
I'm trying to figure out who to read

3539
03:26:48,980 --> 03:26:49,980
Oh my god, we're gonna read

3540
03:26:49,980 --> 03:26:50,980
Read me, read me

3541
03:26:50,980 --> 03:26:51,980
I can't read

3542
03:26:51,980 --> 03:26:52,980
I got

3543
03:26:52,980 --> 03:26:53,980
Are you on YouTube?

3544
03:26:54,980 --> 03:26:55,980
No

3545
03:26:56,980 --> 03:26:58,980
You can't do that

3546
03:26:58,980 --> 03:27:00,980
I'm like, are you dual streaming?

3547
03:27:00,980 --> 03:27:01,980
Cause then I would

3548
03:27:01,980 --> 03:27:05,980
One day, one day, one day, one day, one day, one day, one day

3549
03:27:06,980 --> 03:27:07,980
One day

3550
03:27:07,980 --> 03:27:09,980
One day, one day

3551
03:27:09,980 --> 03:27:10,980
Alright

3552
03:27:10,980 --> 03:27:12,980
I'll read this person

3553
03:27:12,980 --> 03:27:13,980
Okay

3554
03:27:13,980 --> 03:27:14,980
Who are you gonna read?

3555
03:27:14,980 --> 03:27:16,980
I'll just read whoever you read on Twitch

3556
03:27:16,980 --> 03:27:18,980
If you're ending

3557
03:27:18,980 --> 03:27:19,980
I'm not even ending

3558
03:27:19,980 --> 03:27:20,980
I'm not even ending

3559
03:27:20,980 --> 03:27:21,980
Just read her

3560
03:27:21,980 --> 03:27:22,980
Okay, guys

3561
03:27:22,980 --> 03:27:26,980
I'm sending my pop horse to you

3562
03:27:26,980 --> 03:27:27,980
Alright, bye guys

3563
03:27:27,980 --> 03:27:28,980
Thank you for having me

3564
03:27:28,980 --> 03:27:30,980
Guys, you've been reading so much

3565
03:27:30,980 --> 03:27:32,980
I had so much fun

3566
03:27:32,980 --> 03:27:34,980
Love you

3567
03:27:41,980 --> 03:27:43,980
BGM is loud as hell

3568
03:27:43,980 --> 03:27:44,980
Hi

3569
03:27:44,980 --> 03:27:46,980
Hello, it's me

3570
03:27:47,980 --> 03:27:48,980
It was lovely

3571
03:27:48,980 --> 03:27:50,980
What did you think of the girlies?

3572
03:27:50,980 --> 03:27:51,980
Aren't they amazing?

3573
03:27:52,980 --> 03:27:54,980
I know how to pick them

3574
03:27:55,980 --> 03:27:58,980
But I hope you guys have a wonderful night

3575
03:27:58,980 --> 03:28:00,980
Thank you for coming to stream

3576
03:28:00,980 --> 03:28:03,980
I thought it was a really fun collab

3577
03:28:03,980 --> 03:28:05,980
I just blinked in like one eye

3578
03:28:05,980 --> 03:28:07,980
Blinked slower than the other

3579
03:28:07,980 --> 03:28:09,980
That was really weird

3580
03:28:10,980 --> 03:28:11,980
But yeah

3581
03:28:11,980 --> 03:28:16,980
I'll probably collab with those girls again

3582
03:28:16,980 --> 03:28:18,980
Nory is freaking hilarious

3583
03:28:18,980 --> 03:28:20,980
If you like little base bug girls

3584
03:28:20,980 --> 03:28:21,980
Go see her

3585
03:28:21,980 --> 03:28:23,980
And then Chai is sweet

3586
03:28:23,980 --> 03:28:25,980
And also super fucking funny

3587
03:28:25,980 --> 03:28:27,980
So if you like little cutesy

3588
03:28:27,980 --> 03:28:29,980
Cute and funny double girls

3589
03:28:29,980 --> 03:28:30,980
Go see her

3590
03:28:30,980 --> 03:28:31,980
So please check them out

3591
03:28:31,980 --> 03:28:33,980
Their channels and their Twitter

3592
03:28:33,980 --> 03:28:35,980
Are in my description

3593
03:28:36,980 --> 03:28:39,980
Just like a bigger booger

3594
03:28:39,980 --> 03:28:41,980
She really knows how to pick them

3595
03:28:41,980 --> 03:28:42,980
Exactly

3596
03:28:42,980 --> 03:28:45,980
I hope you guys have a wonderful night

3597
03:28:45,980 --> 03:28:47,980
Bye

3598
03:28:47,980 --> 03:28:49,980
Scum of the earth

3599
03:28:54,980 --> 03:28:56,980
I'll also say for the raid

3600
03:28:57,980 --> 03:28:59,980
Gonna raid some B&U girls

3601
03:29:05,980 --> 03:29:07,980
Thanks for watching
