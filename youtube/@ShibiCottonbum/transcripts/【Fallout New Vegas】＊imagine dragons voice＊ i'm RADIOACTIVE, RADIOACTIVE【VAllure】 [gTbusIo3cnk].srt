1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,560
Why did I put 6pm? I don't even recall. Anyways, surprise, it me. I'm here. 50 hours early.

2
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:39,520
Is it even working? Hilar? What am I streaming to? Is there a lag? Oh my god. Okay. There

3
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:50,920
isn't. Sick. I just took a bazillion years. Anyways. Forever streaming. I just never

4
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:57,240
stop. Never stop streaming. It's only me, myself, and I in the chat right now. Nobody knows I'm here.

5
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,800
Nobody knows what's going to occur. Nobody knows that I'm streaming like three hours in advance.

6
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:11,320
Two hours in advance. Nobody knows. Oh, I've been had. They've spotted me. Maybe I should

7
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:22,520
until 6pm. Dabumi? What are you doing? Are you having fun, sir? Sorry for the noise.

8
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,920
Deceiver! Deceiver! I just want to stream. I can't stay away. I don't know what to eat.

9
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,200
I just want to stream. It's all I want to do in life is stream. I don't want to stop.

10
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:43,240
Let's see how long my internet lasts. Her head's not attached to her body again. Don't

11
00:01:44,920 --> 00:02:01,000
look at that. Don't look at that. You didn't see anything. I'm holding a controller? Yes.

12
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:08,840
Today's been an interesting day. I woke up,

13
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,880
and that's it. That's it. I didn't do anything else before this. Nothing happened.

14
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:22,520
I definitely didn't play Elden Ring for three hours. I definitely didn't eat crab, do a mukbang

15
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:29,240
stream. I definitely didn't make some comments that I had no reason to make comments about because

16
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:33,240
I had nothing to do with me. But that's just me in general. But those things never happened.

17
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,840
I don't know if some of you guys are delusional. If you think stuff happened,

18
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:44,920
it did not. I didn't spike my controller several times. I didn't smash something.

19
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:54,280
I didn't punch a plushie for like two minutes straight. That never happened. I have done

20
00:02:54,280 --> 00:03:02,360
absolutely nothing before this stream besides be cute and hang out with my cats and watch Elden

21
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:08,600
Ring lore videos. That's all I've been doing this entire time. All I've been doing. But I'll tweet

22
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:21,400
that I'm live now. I will tweet that I'm live now. I won't lie to you. I thought I was streaming at

23
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:28,360
four, but I don't. Maybe I put myself at six because I know Amy is strong and you're streaming.

24
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:36,040
I didn't forgot. Again, I just I got distracted and I was like, oh, I need to stream. And then I'm

25
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:45,160
like, wait, I already, you guys know how scatterbrained I am. Yeah, nothing, nothing. Yeah, I apologize

26
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:55,000
for the overlap. I just forget the times I stream at sometimes and when I change it for my normal

27
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:03,000
time. So we can't do that too for a bit. Because I feel bad if people were like, okay, I'm gonna

28
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,640
make time at six p.m. Eastern to make sure I can watch madam. And then I'm just not there.

29
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:15,880
Or I'm still streaming at that time for like five hours. I miss Endurance thing. Follow New Vegas.

30
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:24,680
And we'll we'll see. I've never played a follow game for my life.

31
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:36,440
Except for like that one like material management thing. Let me post the thumbnail.

32
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:52,440
Here it is. Such a goofy thumbnail management made for me. Hi, I'm live early because I

33
00:04:52,440 --> 00:05:03,800
forgot that I said I would stream at six p.m. Eastern time. I don't remember my own schedule.

34
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:18,200
But hi, I'm sorry. Let me just copy that video link real quick like

35
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:37,720
add tweet and post all. I'm alive now. Hi there. Yeah, I didn't stream at all. I kind of missed you

36
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:44,360
guys this morning. I wanted I wanted to stream when I wasn't able to really stinks. I don't know.

37
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,560
I don't know. I was like blanked out from this morning. I just remember watching Elmer and

38
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:57,080
War videos. It's not a recall. My cats are playing in the background. It's mostly Bumi.

39
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:05,080
It's really just Bumi. He's breakdancing on a piece of cardboard where they're left on the floor.

40
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:15,080
I came from a cardboard box. Oh, he's winding up. He's gonna pounce. Get it Bumi. Pounce on it.

41
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:22,440
Good job. Did you knock it under the couch? Okay, he didn't. Thank God.

42
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:33,160
I was always Bumi. Why would it? It's always Bumi. It's always Bumi. Let's hang out. Let's hang out

43
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:39,480
for a little bit of chat. Let's just spend time together. Let's just hang out. Let people come

44
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:48,200
in because I'm very early. Let's just chill. I have a mysterious beverage next to me. I don't

45
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:57,720
recall purchasing. I think it's what's called a Shirley Temple. How was my crab? I don't know what

46
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:03,560
you're talking about. I'm streaming a lot today. This is the first time I've streamed all day.

47
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:11,880
I don't know. I'm kind of hungry. Guys think I should order some crab? You guys talking about

48
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:19,400
crab makes me want to order crab. Sorry, that's my cat. I was just to take, I feel like I should

49
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:25,480
take like a, I did something to my neck. Another crab treasure was weeks ago. That's true.

50
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,280
I mentioned I dream of eating crab. Maybe you'll do that tomorrow.

51
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:41,720
Let me get some water. Oh wait, did I not fill up the bread up? Freak. All right, I'll get a seltzer

52
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:49,880
water and shit.

53
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:05,880
Let me get some of this coffee.

54
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:12,040
That's not already broken.

55
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:16,040
These are already broken.

56
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,040
I'll have some acetaminophen.

57
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:24,040
Acetaminophen.

58
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:30,040
I hurt my neck somehow. I don't recall. This is Sheebie, my beloved.

59
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,120
I don't know. I'm holding up a game controller when I'm going to be using mouse and keyboard,

60
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:40,040
but you know, it is how it is. Yes, I have watched the TV series. It was pretty good.

61
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,280
I like that actress because she was really in like yellow jackets.

62
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,240
Cracking a cold one with the boys.

63
00:08:49,240 --> 00:09:03,640
Yeah, it is at the normal time, but still.

64
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,640
So let's chat. Let's hang out. How's your day going so far?

65
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:21,560
Welcome to HairMembers. Welcome. We are doing a scary movie three watch along next week,

66
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,080
so I hope you'll be around for that.

67
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:31,800
Let me... It's going into my BGM, so I'm not just staring at you in the darkness and the

68
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:39,240
darkest in the silence. Got work chilling. Yeah. How's work going? If you're working right now,

69
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:44,200
how's it going? Let me take away my controller and put my hands down.

70
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,760
Sorry, my cat is Tokyo drifting.

71
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:56,760
Oh, there's a little boy. Put my hands... Whoa. Maybe I should change my outfit for this stream.

72
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:05,400
I think it'll change my outfit. Let's find something else.

73
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:14,280
Hmm. Well, what would be a good outfit for this stream?

74
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,680
Would this be a good outfit? No, I can't... I can't do that.

75
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,720
What are you doing, sir?

76
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:36,920
I can make myself a body of stuff again. I can bring back... I can bring... Cowboy?

77
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,400
I don't have any cowboy fits. I can get myself a cowboy hat.

78
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,280
I can... I can get myself a cowboy hat.

79
00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:01,800
I don't know what you're talking about. Okay, I had an outfit. I don't know where it went,

80
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:08,600
because I was going to wear that one. I used it the other day during the doom stream and it's just

81
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:19,480
missing now. What's this? I don't know what this is. Hey, my hands are white. Don't worry about it.

82
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:31,480
This isn't it. This isn't... This isn't it. I'm going to just place myself on my bed.

83
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,760
All right, I'll be back here. I'm searching.

84
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,640
It's two hours to make... Sorry, you don't have two hours anymore.

85
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,280
Kind of stressed because the IRL stuff has a bunch of stuff I want to do that doesn't

86
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:59,000
know what I need to do. Take it one step at a time. Do what you can, because I know me,

87
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:05,080
I get overwhelmed thinking I have like a bunch of stuff to do. And if you literally just try like

88
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:10,760
doing at least one thing a day, it could be just a little bit helpful. Just one thing.

89
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:17,960
Where did this outfit go? It's completely gone. Oh wait, I know what happened to it. Hold on.

90
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:28,600
I never imported it. Please hold. You might see some unusual changes happen.

91
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:37,000
Do not be afraid. Do not be concerned. It is all temporary. Temporary, okay?

92
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,240
Everybody keeps talking about crab legs. I don't know why.

93
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:54,840
Live 2D froze. Hold on. Okay, now we're better. Please hold. I'm gonna...

94
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:00,280
I need to change the color of my skin real quick.

95
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,480
We're just chilling. We're just letting people come in. Muppet sheebie. I'm not gonna be a

96
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:14,840
muppet. Watch. Maybe. I could be a muppet for this. We could be a muppet for this.

97
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:23,960
Hold on. I saved my hex code. Where is it?

98
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,440
Uh, okay. Hex code locking in.

99
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:49,960
This is a lot of things I'll have to type. F7D2BA. I'm not typing. F7D2BA.

100
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:56,280
I like how I change from green to tan with just a single single thing.

101
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,480
And then we continue.

102
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:11,640
I'm just gonna slowly become brown. I'm just I'm just toasting right now.

103
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:18,040
I'm just getting a little toasty. I'll throw on my head in a moment. This is this is a model.

104
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:22,040
So how I do it, by the way, when you guys see me like put on outfits,

105
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:28,440
sometimes just putting it in the item folder doesn't work. I have to

106
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:37,000
make it a model and then import it. I don't know why. I know not everybody does that,

107
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,920
but I changed the colors first so I don't have to do it later because it's easier to do it this

108
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:48,760
way than through the item section. If you are wondering, if you're wondering, you can see my

109
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:53,960
legs flashing. That's a good sign. It means it means everything's going according to plan and

110
00:14:53,960 --> 00:15:01,960
you don't have to be scared. All right. I'm fully transforming into my best self to my true self,

111
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:10,520
which is Dullahan. You know, I've currently lost my head. I definitely have to do a Dullahan

112
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:17,080
script writing thing. Maybe I'll write that script for October. Petrion.

113
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:28,280
And let me put that. Hopefully I recall I did all the right colors. Let's move to the other side.

114
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,760
Let's make this red.

115
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:44,200
Oh, I'm not sorry. That's boomy. Let's make it red.

116
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,800
Be a little bit on brand.

117
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:58,760
I can actually make this. That also changes color too. There's a toggle to change the color for

118
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:03,880
that. So then I click OK. Pulling a marshmallow. What?

119
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:12,280
Yeah, don't spread yourself too thin. So how are you doing a mukbang crap? What? I don't know

120
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:18,200
what you're talking about. Wait, is she being actually gyaru? No, I'm just tan.

121
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,040
Just because I'm tan doesn't mean I'm gyaru people. That is a totally different thing.

122
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:31,800
But anyways, so now I click on this and I do load current model as a life 2D item. And then I do that.

123
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,720
You do and it's loading and it's loading and it's loading and it's loading and it's loading

124
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:50,920
and it's loading. Oh, and now there's two. Fabulous save, save, cancel. Put that in the trash. And now

125
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,000
I'm going to transform.

126
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:05,800
I'm just, I'm just yapping and this is getting out of hand. I mean, getting out of head.

127
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:14,520
I'm just yapping because I'm not, I'm not at the time I said I would stream at. So I'm giving

128
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:20,760
people a chance to come in. So we're just hanging out. We are being chilling up in here.

129
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:31,880
It never loaded in. Oh boy. Did I do that all for nothing? Where is it?

130
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,560
Okay, hold on. I'm just going to close life 2D and then restart it.

131
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:46,440
Do you guys want me to like give you some inspirational stuff? Like do you want me to tell you

132
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:53,960
some good things? What do you guys going through? Let mama Shibi help you out.

133
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:05,560
Let me gas you up. You gas me up. I gas you up. Gas, gas, gas. I want to step on the gas.

134
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:12,920
Oh, yeah, yeah. Don't tell me that the thing thing is there. I know it's there.

135
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:25,480
It literally just never imported. What the hell? I'm kind of pissed, brother. What is this junk?

136
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:33,960
You want through life? Life be lifeing. Indeed.

137
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:41,000
It's a floating head? No, it's not. I don't know what you're talking about.

138
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,080
Maybe it, maybe it crashed.

139
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,360
Maybe if I leave that there.

140
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:13,240
And then I, and then I switch the model out. Maybe it'll stay. Okay, it did.

141
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:24,600
No, this is Patrick. All right, perfect. My head is up here. Let me just, this is, nope, my mole.

142
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,960
Sorry, I'm scratching my nose.

143
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:36,760
Hi.

144
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,560
Okay.

145
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:51,080
Don't worry about that. There we go. What this?

146
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:58,040
Glofts? Oh, wait, crap. Hold on. Hold on.

147
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:12,360
B2 Studio has frozen. B2 Studio has frozen. Come on, B2 Studio, I believe in you.

148
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,200
There we go. Now we can hang out.

149
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:35,480
Say I have a big head? That's not very nice. That's not very nice, is it?

150
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,960
I'm a little wiggly.

151
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:53,400
I'm sure I can come up nice and, nice and close.

152
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:02,600
This is cute. This is a cute fit. I feel, hold on. Can I add another mole?

153
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,760
Is this me just playing dress up constantly on stream?

154
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:21,160
That won't stay. That won't stay.

155
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:27,960
Okay. What about, oh, frick.

156
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:38,920
Can I put it on my shoulder? Because I do have, I have, I have a bunch of beauty marks.

157
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,560
That kind of works, I guess.

158
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:58,600
Dress to impress, but she be addition. Frick.

159
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:08,440
Put that there. Put this here. Put that,

160
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:16,200
a little, I do have a fucking big head. Jesus Christ. Put that there.

161
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,400
Let's add another mole, just because.

162
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:32,200
I got that, I got that real gifa. That's when I'm going to start calling it.

163
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:39,640
That real gifa. Well, no, I don't want that there. Can I put it like, well, my mole is

164
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,680
really down there, so it doesn't have to. Oh, actually, you know, it kind of sticks out.

165
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,080
This will, this will just be for the, for the screenshots.

166
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,240
I also have an armpit mole, but I can't really stick it in my armpit.

167
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:07,560
You know what I discovered? So I was looking at my body as a girl does, and I was just like,

168
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:12,360
I have two, so I have, hold on, let me move up. Let me put that to the side.

169
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:19,880
I discovered, where is it? I can't, here it is. I found it. Where'd it go?

170
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:25,640
I discovered I have one right here, and well, like right here and right here on each thigh,

171
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:30,120
and they're like symmetrical. I also have one of my foot.

172
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,960
I have one on my arm down here. I'm like, when, I'm like,

173
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:47,320
why did becoming a Vtuber show me, just make me realize how many beauty marks I have,

174
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:52,040
and I never noticed them before. I also have some in other places, but you don't need to know that.

175
00:23:53,800 --> 00:24:00,200
Proof? I've posted proof. Do I have any on my knees? No.

176
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:10,680
Yeah, I have one right there, and I have one up there. That is so funny. I literally have one

177
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:19,880
right here. Is that going to stay? Oh, it kind of does. And then I have one on the other side,

178
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,720
a little bit higher up. Hey.

179
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,320
I'm trying to wink, but it's kind of hard when I turn the sensitivity down.

180
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:41,480
They say beauty marks are where you've been kissed in a past life, or where you've been stabbed.

181
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:47,400
So I could have been stabbed a lot. I also have freckles on my face, but I can't like add freckles.

182
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:52,200
Is there a freckle? Hold on.

183
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,720
Freckle asset Vtuber.

184
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,280
Free freckle assets.

185
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:13,080
Click. Yeah, but where is it? You just posted a photo of yourself.

186
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:26,760
Found it. Let's go. That's actually super cute. Oh my god, guys, I'm about to be hotter than I was before.

187
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,320
I used to hate my freckles.

188
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,640
Now I like my freckles.

189
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:46,200
Why didn't? Can I rename that?

190
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:54,360
It's such a weird show and folder. Do you like playing dress up with me?

191
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:03,880
I like playing dress up. So my mom would make fun of me and my dad because we would literally spend

192
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:09,880
the majority of our time in Destiny 2 making our characters look cool. And so anytime,

193
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:15,000
because like I would play on my computer in my room and my dad would play in the living room.

194
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:21,240
We do like cross platform or whatever. My mom's like, you guys gonna play the dress up game?

195
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,640
Cool. Can I draw? So now I just need to do

196
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:40,440
streaming assets, items, drag and drop the freckles into this folder. Oh, didn't mean to do that.

197
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:50,680
Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Please unclick and move to items. Fabulous. Close. Close.

198
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:57,160
Like I remember, I just like dressing up and making my character. Like I just,

199
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:05,960
it's just fun. It's just great. Let's see if it loaded. Oh, it did.

200
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:34,040
Is this a new character? Did I just make a new character? Am I not chibi anymore? Am I someone else?

201
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,160
I need a cowboy hat.

202
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:54,200
Cowboy hat. Oh, this asset is by Poproxy. Thank you, Poproxy. Cowboy hat

203
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,120
asset

204
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,120
VTuber

205
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:08,680
Wait, why do I need a cowboy hat? I don't even, someone just said I should have a cowboy hat.

206
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:15,560
I don't know why I'm getting a cowboy. Am I going to be Southern? Am I going to do Southern bell accent?

207
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:22,840
No, that's, Shabritney is actually Shabbany's real name. Shabethany, like that, Shabeti.

208
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:29,560
Southern bell bunny. Can I do a Southern accent? Oh, sugar. Of course I can do a Southern accent.

209
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:35,560
It's not that good and Azur will be very mad to hear it because she hates my Southern accent

210
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:39,080
because Azur is from the South and I don't do a Southern accent that well.

211
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:48,520
We'll hold on. We'll see. Do I have a spreadsheet? No, I don't have a spreadsheet.

212
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,680
I should just play Red Dead Redemption.

213
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:00,520
Now we're going to do the same thing.

214
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:07,480
Now, now, we're going to do the same thing and we're going to, we're going to put on the cowboy hat

215
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:13,880
and I'm going to look real cute with the cowboy hat on. It might take me a moment.

216
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:20,520
Bear with me. I have to do all this stuff again.

217
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:30,440
VTube studio data and I need to go streaming assets and then items and then I've already downloaded it

218
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,640
and it's already downloaded.

219
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:43,240
Is this the correct one? No, I don't want that one. I want this one.

220
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:54,520
Cowboy hat one. We just dropped that in there and now I have a cowboy hat.

221
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:03,640
I love childs and me and she be shimmy. I'm a dummy sister.

222
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:10,840
More VTubers need big hats.

223
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:21,400
Cowboy hat, PNG and there we go.

224
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:31,800
I am now officially, I don't know what my name should be.

225
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:43,400
I'm, I'm what should my name be? Hold on, let me move this to the, move this to the side some.

226
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:49,080
There we go. Maybe I should flip it because I'm facing the other direction.

227
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:54,200
Oh, maybe when I, when I start playing, I'm going to be looking in this direction. So maybe it's fine.

228
00:30:55,160 --> 00:31:04,680
Shabelle, Shibulu, I like Shibulu. Shibulu, Shabetty, Shabetty is pretty good.

229
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:13,720
Mouse voice count. Oh my stars. It's funny. I just looked at

230
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:20,520
Azur just tweeted and just said no and I thought, I just thought she was messaging me.

231
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:27,400
Oh my God. No, it's because the Capri sons put them in bottles like somebody said. Oh my gosh.

232
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:36,920
Shabelle, that doesn't sound appropriate. I need a bigger, I have a big iron. You guys have seen my big iron.

233
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:47,240
Shabelle, because I'm a Southern, well Shabelle was supposed to be the younger sister of

234
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:54,120
Shabathani and Shibani and she's supposed to have the really high pitch voice, but I think

235
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:59,320
that this fits, this fits better. So I'll have to come up with another name for that younger sister.

236
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:11,880
But don't, don't ever think I don't keep it on me. I always be saying strap sugar.

237
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,320
Don't, don't, don't ever think I'm never lacking. Okay.

238
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,800
Every time I die, the hat will get bigger.

239
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:27,960
In fact, maybe I should shrink the hat so I can make it bigger over time. Hold on. Let me, let me just

240
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,680
free.

241
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:50,280
The chat break on stream, it usually does. In fact, don't worry. When I switch to the other one, it'll be

242
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:59,240
hold on. Let me just delete this and let me, let me come over here. Where's my arm?

243
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:06,920
Um, something don't look right there, but don't, don't worry about it. I'll fix that.

244
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:12,840
I don't know why that's like that. I think it's my skin tone. It looks like my arms popped off,

245
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:18,280
but you were not even going to see that. So the iron mouse.

246
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:24,440
I don't even sound like iron mouse. Iron mouse has a different voice.

247
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:32,520
Cowgirls leave me. That's just a flesh wound. I accidentally changed the color of this.

248
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:40,760
Uh, but anytime I try to look up the outfit, it's not there. I don't know why.

249
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:48,040
I'm not quite sure where it went, but I'm not going to question it.

250
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,200
Howdy there, Goofy.

251
00:33:55,560 --> 00:34:02,200
I got the fastest whip in the west. Hold on. I got the fastest whip in the west.

252
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,120
Fastest whip in the west.

253
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:20,680
I also have my leash. It's kind of, it's behind my body, but don't worry about it.

254
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:28,600
Oh, wait, what's this do? I thought I could put my cover up, but it's a little won't be,

255
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,520
it'll be in front of me. I mean behind me.

256
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:33,800
Um,

257
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:42,440
why am I like this? Why do I just play other characters in the one that I'm supposed to

258
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:51,320
be playing? I don't know why. Don't ask me. Oh, anyways, let's, let's just play video games or whatever.

259
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,440
Let's just play video games or whatever.

260
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:11,000
Uh, I think it's on the launcher still. Let me just,

261
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,280
her madam has been kidnapped. I don't know.

262
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:23,240
Oh, my, my tongue, I think I scrubbed my tongue too hard this morning.

263
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:28,600
I don't know.

264
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:46,200
Is this working? I don't, what's up with my face? What happened?

265
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:55,240
What's going on? Hold on. I'm going to fix this. It's not working. I'm trapped.

266
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:01,080
I'm trapped in the fucking ether. Help. I can't say chat.

267
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:15,480
You say that? I can't. Please. I'm stuck in the loading screen. Why is my sensitivity for my

268
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:25,000
mouth so freaking high? Holy crap. Um,

269
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:35,960
what on earth? I can't even, doesn't even let me change the, oh, I want, I want subtitles.

270
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,000
Guys, it's not even letting me change the display.

271
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:51,400
Are you serious? Why was it letting me go into full screen or I can't even get it?

272
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:55,880
Help. I can't even,

273
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:05,000
this game's already freaking broken. Well, it's not broken. I'm just an idiot, but don't worry about it.

274
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:16,200
Can I just quit? I need to be able to, it's not even letting me,

275
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:25,640
help. Okay, I'm going to quit. Yes, I want to exit the game.

276
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:38,680
Please let me move. Oh my God. Finally. Raiders. Hi Raiders. Hello. Howdy, howdy, how are you doing, Raiders?

277
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:46,440
I have to save often? Okay. I hope you guys had a good stream. I know you guys were,

278
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:53,160
what were you doing? You were playing Kill of the Fire. I hope you guys had fun.

279
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,720
Howdy. Tipping my hat to you, sir.

280
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:07,960
Okay, let me see if I can, guys, I don't know how I'm going to do this because it's not letting me

281
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:14,520
change the game capture. It's only letting me select. Oh my God. I just hate it here.

282
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,800
I click play.

283
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:32,760
I try to quickly switch it over. Oh no. It pushes everything to the side and I can't see the stream.

284
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:38,840
Wait. I figured it out. Oh my God. What the hell is happening?

285
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:47,960
I figured it out. Don't worry. I found, I found a way. Hold on. There are dogs barking.

286
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,880
There are dogs barking.

287
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:06,520
Shabby is playing Australia. I'm playing what? I didn't put my headphones in. I haven't done that

288
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:11,560
yet. Well, now I can't see OBS. Every time I open this game, it pushes all my windows to the side,

289
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:16,680
though I have two displays. Do I have any mods? No. We're going in. We're going in vanilla and

290
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:22,840
naked. Okay. We're going in vanilla and naked. Well, slap me with butter and call me a biscuit.

291
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:31,400
Is it too loud? You can't even hear it at all, actually. Oh, shit. Hold on.

292
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:37,720
I'm going to fix this. Don't worry. Don't worry. It's small in a corner. Don't worry about it.

293
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:46,120
I don't know why it's trying to push all my windows to the demo. It looks like I'm just

294
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:49,560
never going to be able to see OBS. I'd rather see you guys than OBS, so.

295
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:59,640
That's fine. I don't know why it layers my windows one over the other, although I got two

296
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:09,080
different things. Okay. I'm chilly. There's no borderless window setting. I went to settings.

297
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:14,920
One, let me see if I can change my mouse sensitivity down. Jeez. Why is it so slow?

298
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:18,920
Oh, but it feels high. Can I just turn it off?

299
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:30,360
Whoa. I'm whipping. Let's just keep it on one and hope for the best. What is action mapping?

300
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:35,880
I don't know what that means. Oh, my God. Should I play this with a different?

301
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,240
Can I play this with controller? I don't even know.

302
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:51,400
Settings. Display. See, it doesn't let me. It doesn't let me pick. I don't know why that's not a thing.

303
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,240
Who is chilly?

304
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:08,200
Try by pressing a button. Would it be? Is it easier to play with controller? I don't.

305
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:15,960
It's actually not letting me do controller. What is going on?

306
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:23,720
I would prefer to play this with controller. Maybe if I plug it in and plug it,

307
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:27,880
I'm plugging it and plug it back in. Some of my mom always says, she said,

308
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:32,360
if you don't, if something ain't working, I'll plug it and plug it back in.

309
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:42,360
Okay. Well, now my controller isn't responsive at all.

310
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:58,520
I don't know what this just did to my controller. Anyways, looks like we can't do that.

311
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:05,080
I don't know. The world is against me today.

312
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:10,520
Ow, I just smacked the microphone. I didn't even mean to. Anyways,

313
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:16,200
am I too big? Am I too big?

314
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:32,360
Oh my God, please. No, it just closed. Oh my God.

315
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:38,280
I'm perfect. I don't know about that. I think I'm too big.

316
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:45,240
Nobody told me that my BGM was still playing.

317
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:51,320
All right. I think, you know what? I don't care anymore. We're just gonna do our best

318
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,720
and hope for the best.

319
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:09,160
Wait, no, I don't have a, I don't have a save game. Why is it letting me continue?

320
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:20,040
Okay. So I've never played a follow. Okay, let me just drop the stupid accent.

321
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,320
I've never played a follow game.

322
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:31,880
I've seen the show though. I smacked the microphone again because I'm gesturing with my hands.

323
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:49,080
Oh, Gamora and it's on fire, like Sodom and Gamora. The tops. This looks pretty good for

324
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:56,040
Vault 21, but it's outside.

325
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,880
What? That flame effect was actually pretty sick.

326
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:09,400
Oh.

327
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,720
The city looks pretty nice for

328
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,600
an apocalypse. I won't lie to you.

329
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:29,320
Why is he dressed so nicely? Do they have washing machines at work?

330
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,400
That's a dead body.

331
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:38,680
War never changes. War? They said it.

332
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:45,640
Yes.

333
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:53,640
Yes.

334
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:56,680
Indeed.

335
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:03,400
Why are they all of old timey? Oh, because everything probably has to be like

336
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:08,920
not analog. It has to be analog. I don't know.

337
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,280
Got a little crispy even in the wasteland.

338
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:36,760
Colorado.

339
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:40,280
MCR.

340
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,480
My chemical romance is in this game.

341
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,080
It is a great aesthetic. I agree with this.

342
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:09,640
Okay.

343
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:19,800
Has anybody made a game similar to Fallout but like modern day? I feel like that does exist.

344
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,000
I just don't know the name of it.

345
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:39,320
I wonder what it's going to be like in 2077 when hopefully I'm dead.

346
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:43,880
But when people

347
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:53,880
they play this game at the same time, it's called a rough server metro out of worlds.

348
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:58,360
That's cool.

349
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:00,840
Help.

350
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:04,600
Give me out.

351
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:12,360
This looks weirder than

352
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:20,280
Vampire of the Masquerade to me for some reason. It's like very uncanny valley.

353
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:29,400
He just called me kitten. I'm not your discord kitten. That's a nice

354
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:34,600
gun. Is that a deagle? I don't know guns. It's not. It's not a deagle at all.

355
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:38,760
Why can I see it see through it?

356
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,320
Oh, okay.

357
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,880
It's an AK-47 understood.

358
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:57,480
Wait, Benny is Matthew Perry? That guy?

359
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:10,360
I remember watching Friends for the first time. I like when I was younger, I was watching those

360
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:14,520
shows when I really shouldn't have. It was when they already ended and everything.

361
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:21,160
And I was way too young to be watching those because I was just like I didn't get any of the

362
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:28,600
references. Friends and I thought you would come on your upper lip. Friends and how I met your mother.

363
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:32,200
Yeah, RIP Matthew Perry.

364
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:37,720
My name is Shibbell.

365
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:51,720
You're a dog or a dog? I'm deaf.

366
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:58,120
Yeah, I thought the volume was low myself. Hold on. I just turned it up for me. Let me turn it up for

367
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:05,000
you guys. Is that good?

368
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:17,080
Now I can't see the chat. Help. Turn up the volume and everybody disappears. I didn't even take my meds

369
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:26,760
and you guys are gone. Why does it keep? Okay, I'm gonna minimize these windows and then keep you

370
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:42,680
guys open. Maybe a bit loud? Oh my god. All you guys do is complain, complain, complain.

371
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,680
Did I take my meds yesterday? I might have forgotten.

372
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:57,080
I can't get up to max. Yeah, but then I'll be deaf.

373
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:05,480
You complain because we care. Do you? Do you really love me?

374
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:11,480
Your needlework?

375
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:17,800
Did you use Michael as golden needle? What is that?

376
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:24,520
That is not me. That's for sure. I'm a woman.

377
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:33,240
Still looks a bit all race. Hispanic.

378
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,600
I'm sorry. This is an African-American woman.

379
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:54,360
Let's see. Let's see. Where's my racial? Can't I be both? This game is not inclusive.

380
00:50:56,120 --> 00:51:00,440
I'm about to be a white woman. No, I'm about to be Hispanic because that's my actual skin tone.

381
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:03,000
Let's change my face. Randomize.

382
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:09,400
That's the same. Sick. Nothing happened.

383
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:21,080
No. No. No. No. No. That looks good, man.

384
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:27,800
Can I change my hair? I can be like super elderly.

385
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:41,320
Hair style. What are the names of these? Oh, I clicked no. Oh, I'm just dumb.

386
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:50,440
Guys, I'm now Hispanic. I've decided. Can I? Honestly, I'm not going to lie. This is kind of a

387
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:56,040
sick haircut. I kind of want to be a VTuber with this haircut now.

388
00:51:56,600 --> 00:52:02,520
It's little horns. It's like that one anime character that's like, I forget.

389
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:07,400
She's like tan, but she has like actual hair, but then her hair like goes like little whispies,

390
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:13,560
you know, seductress. Okay. I kind of have a five o'clock shadow. I don't think I like that.

391
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,360
Let's see what I look like when I'm African-American.

392
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:22,600
That's terrifying.

393
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:27,640
These are all terrifying, especially that one.

394
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:34,360
So this is just a brown Asian woman. Okay. Well, I guess I will be Hispanic.

395
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:41,480
Hey, where's the face that I had?

396
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:47,800
The faces are not.

397
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:56,280
Oh, this is haunting. This is it. Actually, you know what? She looks Argentinian.

398
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:06,600
She's a, she's, she's a Anna Taylor joy type where they are white, but they very fluent in Spanish.

399
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:17,640
Melted Barbie doll accurate. Oh my God. There's so many. Hold on. Let me change the color to blonde.

400
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:20,440
Oh God.

401
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:27,480
Honey. What? I don't, I can't even tell what the, this doesn't,

402
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,040
none of these look blonde.

403
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:40,040
I guess the honey does. Okay. So we'll do that. Blue hairstyle.

404
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:49,560
Domestic goddess. Uh, the names are interesting. Cynthia doll for progress.

405
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:58,040
Rough night. Honestly, me, this kind of looks like my hair, except it needs to be curly.

406
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:01,720
Wendy the welder.

407
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:06,920
A sophisticate. Oh, that's not, that's a nice little bun.

408
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:10,520
Frazzled. She'll click. She's on cocaine.

409
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:16,600
Iron maiden. Understandable. On ladylike. Okay.

410
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:21,560
Rude ridge. Mange. Fallen eight.

411
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:30,360
What are these fucking hairstyles? Fairy tale. Why is everything shaved?

412
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:48,760
Bedraggled. Me. Blast back. The unsettler. Clean cut. Pretty puff. Sarge. Okay. These are just men's

413
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:59,880
hairstyles. Uh, I guess I'll be seductress. What does that mean? I'm kind of scared.

414
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:08,280
Radiation. She be, she be cottonballed.

415
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:14,520
The wasteland is a disaster on hair.

416
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:22,840
I, I would still be hip with the trends. I would still, I have a big ass forehead

417
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:29,160
because I have a lot of knowledge here in my garage, but I, I, I'm still with the trends. Yes.

418
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:35,000
I am a white looking Hispanic woman named Chabelle.

419
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:43,880
My last name is Chabelle. Castillo. Because that's the first Spanish last name that pops up in my hand.

420
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:50,680
Why are you guys insulting my hairstyle?

421
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:57,480
Where, why are you looking, why am I so much taller than you? Can I shoot you?

422
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:02,360
All right. It's not a race. Well, oh, I'm already, it's auto, auto run.

423
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:08,840
Ooh. I don't like how you said that.

424
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:12,760
Uh, the what?

425
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,400
The Vino-Matic veer tester.

426
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:24,680
E. What are the names of these things?

427
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:35,080
I'm reading, you spell anarchy a very weird way.

428
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:42,840
This is like, oh, like when you were at like an arcade and you would like squeeze something and it was weird.

429
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:47,560
Why are there? Oh, what?

430
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:55,720
Rate your strength perception, endurance, charisma, intelligence, agility, and luck.

431
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:58,200
Oh, I like how it spells out special. That's pretty cool.

432
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:14,040
Okay. So my strength, um, strength, this is a lot of, I'm a wet noodle. Can I be a wet noodle?

433
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:23,640
I want to be a baby. Just go with what feels right. A beach. I'll be a doughy baby.

434
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:31,240
So I can put everything into strength. Okay. I'll be a doughy baby.

435
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:36,360
Wait, I have so many points.

436
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:45,160
Can I just max everything to seven then? Oh, no, I see. Okay. Understood. Understood.

437
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:49,960
I'm a doughy baby. Perception.

438
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:54,760
Oh, I'll be an unsuspecting trout.

439
00:57:55,400 --> 00:58:09,560
Hello for the students to survive. I'm, I'm, I'm flamer tartan. That's for sure. I'm a cult leader.

440
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:21,320
I'll be a, I'll be a, I'll be a diplomat. Let's turn this to tough as nails.

441
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:34,680
Intelligence. I'm knowledgeable. I got knowledge. Agility. Catlike.

442
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:41,800
Luck. Leprechaun's foot.

443
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:46,200
I don't know what any of this means.

444
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:48,680
Yep.

445
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:05,080
Sorry, the background music, I can barely fucking hear what you're saying.

446
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:15,640
My dogs? I can't see them. Hey, this was at the carpet I tried to order and put on thrown.

447
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:24,200
Uh, sit. Oh, what the? Why am I just, I'm not wearing any.

448
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:33,880
Yeah, I can't read though. Cat.

449
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:38,840
House. Burglar eyes. Night.

450
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:45,160
Shroud dream. Bandit. Stab.

451
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:48,120
Light.

452
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:55,080
Tark. Mother. Cookie jar.

453
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:03,720
Okay. Now I got a few states. I want you to tell me how much they sound like something you'd say.

454
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:08,120
I can scroll from our options while it's too late. Conflict just ain't in my nature.

455
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:15,080
Uh, I disagree. I can handle conflict. I ain't given to rely on others for

456
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:22,440
support. No, I disagree. I can rely on other people. I'm always fixing to be the center of

457
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:26,920
attention. I like attention, but if I'm in a group, I don't want to be the center of attention.

458
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:34,280
So I'll put no opinion. I'm slow to embrace new ideas. No, I like new ideas. Disagree. I charge

459
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:41,400
in to deal with my problems head on. Incorrect. I have to think about everything. What do you say

460
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:45,240
you have a look at this? That looks like explosions.

461
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:52,600
That looks like a chemical reaction. Is there an explosion? I see two

462
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:59,320
explosions on either side. A broken chain. I guess I'll do a chemical reaction. Okay.

463
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:02,520
How about this one? This looks like a great rune.

464
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:06,760
It looks like a pee pee.

465
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:12,280
There's no, I don't see great ruin as a, as a,

466
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,480
as a BuzzFeed quiz. Am I, yeah, what? I didn't expect any of this. Um,

467
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:27,720
it doesn't look like a coochie to me. I'll say space age technology.

468
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:30,760
Last one. These look like two gnomes holding hands.

469
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,600
None of these are the answer. These are two gnomes holding hands.

470
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:41,240
A head on a pillow because that just sounds weird.

471
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:50,520
Okay.

472
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:55,480
What does this even mean?

473
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:01,400
Energy weapon skills. I don't know what that means.

474
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:11,800
Is this, is this going to tell me my future?

475
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:19,720
This just gave me skills based on my answers. That's what I'm good at.

476
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:29,000
All right. I'll just, I'll keep what I gave me. I'll, I'll, I'm going in so vanilla.

477
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:34,840
Do you need to do a pap smear? Like you're asking a lot from me, bro.

478
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:39,000
So you do need a pap smear.

479
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:49,000
Hold on. I put on subtitles. I don't know why they're not there.

480
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:59,160
I put on dialogue subtitles. Wait, where are they? I think it's on display.

481
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:07,480
Yeah. Dialogue subtitles are on, but I guess I gotta put those on.

482
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,400
Choose up to two traits.

483
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:31,720
Critically hit small frame. My limbs are more easily crippled.

484
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:41,640
Bizarre and silly elements. Am I like, is, what is this? Like the one thing from that one,

485
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:48,520
the Malkovians or whatever they are from the Empire of the Masquerade?

486
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:53,000
Wild wasteland. Okay. Wild wasteland and I'll do,

487
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:58,520
I'll do fast shot.

488
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:02,360
Wait, what's four eyes?

489
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:10,520
Glasses? Oh my God. No, I, I do wear glasses. So I don't, I don't want to,

490
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:15,880
I am good at talking.

491
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:21,080
Which is the other one I should pick?

492
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:26,360
It adds jokes and memes for movies? Oh, I'm glad.

493
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:31,640
Help me pick.

494
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:47,480
Sorry. You want to pick any of the rest of them? All right.

495
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:57,800
All right. I guess that about does it. Do you need to, do you need to look at my teeth

496
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:05,000
before you sell my organs? I can't get up. Oh, why am I, I look, I just look like a white woman.

497
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:08,280
That's fine. Documential.

498
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:16,680
That name sounds so familiar. I feel like I've seen references of him in something else.

499
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:17,960
Here, these are yours.

500
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:23,880
Was all you had on you when you was brought in? I hope you don't mind, but I gave the note a look.

501
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:28,920
I thought it might help me find the next of kin, but it was just something about a platinum chip.

502
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:33,960
Well, if you're hidden back out there, you ought to have this. Can I have clothes?

503
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:39,720
They call it a Pip Boy. I grew up in one of them vaults and made before the war. We all got one.

504
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:43,640
You know, the, the, the mouth tracking is quite impressive.

505
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:48,120
You've been through. I know what it's like having something taken from you.

506
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:53,080
And put this on too so the locals don't pick on you for lack in modesty.

507
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:58,200
Was my wife. That's so kind. I think she was about your size

508
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:02,760
and she hardly wore it after we left the vault. Felt it was too brazen.

509
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:03,480
What does that mean?

510
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:08,680
Thank you. I don't mention it. It's what I'm here for.

511
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:12,120
You, you thank you. You should talk to Sunny Smiles before you leave town.

512
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:16,280
She can help. Sunny Smiles, I need a cool last name.

513
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:20,920
I should be Shabelle. Shabelle Cottonbun.

514
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:33,560
For free? I'll try my best.

515
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:41,320
Follow New Vegas as you play a new hardcore mode. No. Recommended.

516
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:47,080
Okay. Um, thank you.

517
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,360
Shabelle Styles Boom.

518
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:57,160
Don't forget to put my clothes on. How do I put my clothes on?

519
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:02,360
Oh, this looks like the house from, um,

520
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:07,640
or that guy was like trying to screw a chicken.

521
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:16,040
Tab. Oh, radiation.

522
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:25,640
Uh, oh, that's cool how it moves up and down.

523
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:29,400
Honestly, this game is ahead of its time. Items.

524
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:38,200
All weapons fall under a skill and the base damage and

525
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:47,160
that was for second condition repair slash mod respectively. Okay.

526
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:52,840
Oh, I only have a later. Can I put that apparel?

527
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:59,080
Apparel. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm just reading it. I'm not going to read everything out loud.

528
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:07,400
Mm-hmm.

529
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:18,760
And I got a sim pack. I'm assuming bobby pins are for picking locks.

530
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:24,920
Energy weapons.

531
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:38,760
Maintain. Okay.

532
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:43,080
Am I wearing clothes? I can't tell.

533
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:49,800
I got naked. I'm naked now.

534
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:54,760
I thought, oh, is that my arm?

535
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:59,240
Oh, okay.

536
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:09,160
I can press F for third. Oh, damn. I kind of got that figure.

537
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:13,080
This is pretty nifty.

538
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:17,560
Wait, why do I look like naked?

539
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:24,520
Oh, boring.

540
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:30,520
21.

541
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:35,960
I don't want to steal anything from his house.

542
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:45,320
This man just braids me from the dead, although, you know, I would steal stuff

543
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:51,480
because I like to be a kleptomaniac in games. I'm like a little crow. I like to collect trinkets.

544
01:09:52,760 --> 01:10:01,080
Trinkets? Okay. Oh, I can. How do I take out my gun? I don't know. It doesn't matter.

545
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:08,920
Worst sunny smiles. How do I see what the objective is? Question?

546
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:16,440
It's in the tab menu.

547
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:28,200
Um, is it data? Oh, I can play music. Quests. Show location.

548
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:33,160
I can't. Can I scroll?

549
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:43,400
I can't tell if that's the center of my screen. What's that dot? Oh, no, it's fast travel.

550
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:47,160
Okay, so I'm assuming I just go straight ahead.

551
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:51,800
Compass bottom left. I did notice that.

552
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:58,920
Music is heavily copyrighted. Okay, that's fun.

553
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:07,320
There's a nice little place, you know. I wish I had a saloon.

554
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:11,800
Prospector, solid.

555
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:17,160
Am I supposed to go in here? I wish it would actually give me like an indicator.

556
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:24,840
Hi. Hi, EZP. Howdy. What can EZP- You look like Morgan Freeman. Why are you called EZP?

557
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:31,160
Was a prospector until I decided to settle here to get away from the NCR.

558
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:36,760
Now I'll just take it easy and help out with the Brahmin and Big Hornet.

559
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:43,000
Brahmin? Like Hinduism? Question. What's wrong with the NCR?

560
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:49,560
Don't get me wrong. The NCR has got a lot of decent fork in it. It's just that they make

561
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:55,560
you part of them whether you like it or not. Towns like Goodsprings and Prim don't stay independent.

562
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:58,760
The arrow is my indicator. Okay, thank you. Not if you've got something the NCR.

563
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:04,360
Oh, that's right. Because it's a two-headed cut. That's right. I remember seeing that in the show.

564
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:12,280
Okay, cool. I don't really need to know anything else. How do I get out of here? How do I escape?

565
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:16,360
Can I leave? How do I stop talking to you?

566
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:20,520
Help. How do I stop? Oh, goodbye.

567
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:34,840
Thank you, Morgan Freeman. Okay, they must be inside.

568
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:45,960
That was the shittiest line delivery I've ever heard in my life.

569
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:50,120
Cheyenne, stay. Don't worry. She won't bite you.

570
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:58,200
You can teach me to survive. I guess there's a thing or two I could show you.

571
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,320
Sounds like you need all the help you can get after what they done to you.

572
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:09,320
Meet me outside behind the saloon. Thanks, Queen. Can I pet your dog? Can I pet that dog? Can I pet that?

573
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:13,400
Where the fuck did the dog go?

574
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:19,880
Your dog face through the door, ma'am. I think you got us. You got it. I don't think your dog's real.

575
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:24,520
I think you're Delulu. Where the fuck did you go? The hell?

576
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:35,720
Hello? Wait, is that something I can steal? Steal, steal, steal, steal. Oh, it's a workbench. Cool.

577
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:42,280
Can I pet that dog? You're so pretty.

578
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:48,280
Take this and try to hit a couple of them. Sarsaparilla. Take what?

579
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:54,840
Everything all right? I know I'm confused. Until next time.

580
01:13:56,120 --> 01:14:02,760
I feel like I'm playing Skyrim. Oh, you gave me the gun already. How do I? Where are the bottles?

581
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:10,760
I don't, can I just shoot you? No, I won't do that.

582
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:15,960
Bottles on the fence next to the bar.

583
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:27,240
And I wish I could go a little bit faster. Buddy, they're right there. Yeah, but I'm fucking, oh,

584
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:32,280
okay. Can I pet that dog? Can I pet that dog?

585
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:41,080
All right, rooting two in, shooting. Can I scope? Oh, I can. What the hell?

586
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:49,480
Am I actually crazy? That was really weird.

587
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:53,400
I want to go back to first person.

588
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:02,920
Staying still. 360 nose, go. 360 nose, go.

589
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:17,960
You want me to kill some lizards? Okay.

590
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:20,680
I like the geckos though.

591
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:31,000
Can I pet that dog? Why is that dog wearing like that? I think your dog is disease, man.

592
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:39,560
Can I shoot your butt? Can I shoot your butt and steal your dog? I would like to keep your dog.

593
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:50,600
Why do we all have nice asses? I just really want to shoot. Can I give you a second butthole?

594
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:56,280
Can I give you a third hole? Why am I so tall compared to everybody?

595
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:01,800
Press V to make life easier? Oh, what the hell?

596
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:06,600
What?

597
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:13,720
What the fuck?

598
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:20,360
Can I steal your gun? Varmint, right? What?

599
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:30,840
That's a, you see, I've seen that before and I never really understood how it worked because

600
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:38,520
I've seen like a little bit of gameplay of fallout games. Auto targeting, I see.

601
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:44,200
Excuse me puppy, puppy, you gotta move. Mom is trying to get through.

602
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:51,640
Why is that dog so huge? I think you have a wolf. This doesn't really look like a like a dog dog.

603
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:53,480
Oh my god.

604
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:59,640
I don't like your face.

605
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:10,760
I'm a man that's outside the game. I don't know what you're talking about.

606
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:17,480
I missed everything that she said because you guys were talking. I can pit pocket you.

607
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:24,360
I don't see any. Kill the geckos at the whale? Am I supposed to be crouching?

608
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:34,040
Hello? What the hell? Oh, uh, you're bigger than I thought.

609
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:45,560
Yeah, sick and puppy. One of my cats is doing something behind me. Or it's the game I can't tell.

610
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:51,400
Hello? Is that it?

611
01:17:53,640 --> 01:18:01,240
See ya. Is that considered stealing? I'm walking in it. It's probably on sanitary.

612
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:07,240
Oh, is she dead? Oh, I thought that was her body on the ground.

613
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:16,440
Hello. Sorry, I walked away from you.

614
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:20,680
You want you can come along and be worth a few caps to me.

615
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:26,040
How about a pop a cap in your ass? More than a couple minutes, especially with two of us.

616
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:27,880
Okay, cool.

617
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:31,640
Let's go puppy.

618
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:39,240
There's bigger ones. Girl, can you just walk and stop stopping waiting for me to catch up?

619
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:44,440
I'm right behind you. I'm on your ass. Your dog's kind of in the way, but that's fine.

620
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:47,480
The dog isn't no better. It kind of looks like it has a broken leg.

621
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:52,920
I almost shot the dog.

622
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:00,200
I'm trying not to shoot the dog.

623
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:06,200
Oh, puppy. Are you okay?

624
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:13,320
Do you care about your dog at all? They literally just attacked your dog,

625
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:15,560
and you're just walking away. You're not even checking on your dog.

626
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:29,560
Cheyenne. No. Puppy, you have two bullets in you. Did I do that? What?

627
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:40,040
Y'all, hold on. Somehow my chat scrolled up.

628
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:48,520
Those are its eyes on the side.

629
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:53,880
I don't even know where this lady fucking went. I hope they kill her.

630
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:57,720
That'll be funny in the tutorial if they just killed her. Did you kill them all?

631
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:08,680
Oh, nice. What else are you fucking shooting at? It's running. Get that vomit.

632
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:20,360
I can't. I can't run that far. Fast. Oh, get got. Get got. Get got. Back up.

633
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:25,880
Get fucking. These geckos are big.

634
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:35,320
That was it. I saw way more geckos. I saw way more. Oh, what's over here?

635
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:37,720
Is there stuff I can steal?

636
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:52,520
What's this? Is that bottles of water? It's a milk bottle? Oh, okay. Milk.

637
01:20:52,520 --> 01:21:06,440
I think it's using it. It ain't stealing. Okay.

638
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:15,960
I'm just looking for something to take. Don't worry about it. Can I please run faster?

639
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:28,840
Do I need that?

640
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:47,480
Take a bucket. Did you heal your dog? Your dog has two bullets in it.

641
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:53,640
Oh, hell's bells. There's not a day passes by. I don't tell people. Hold R. Okay.

642
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:58,200
Some people, your word just isn't good enough for them. Then this happens.

643
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:04,600
Well, it's a part of what happens. Do people die because of the geckos? Staying out here with me.

644
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:09,320
Here's my end of the deal. One more thing I wanted to show you. That's a lot of auto-cash.

645
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:12,440
I might teach you about living off the land and making useful things for yourself.

646
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:19,080
Interested? Yippee. All right, then. We'll need a couple ingredients to get started.

647
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:23,160
Gonna want some Xander root and a Brock flower. Xander root. What do you think now?

648
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:27,720
I know I've seen Brock flowers growing up with the gravy. Bring those on.

649
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:34,520
Okay, that's great. At the graveyard, I don't even, what the fucking, you're talking like I know

650
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:45,720
where I'm going. I'm assuming I gotta climb shit. Fly. Where do I go? I'll always go up this way.

651
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:53,000
All right. Heal your fucking dog, lady. I have a map.

652
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:57,960
I pressed M. It didn't work.

653
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:04,440
Oh.

654
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:12,920
F3. F3 is the map?

655
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:20,840
That doesn't make no fucking sense. All right. Well, I'm going to this one first.

656
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:37,000
Can I climb? Can I vault? No. I'm not like a Skyrim horse. That's too bad.

657
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:49,720
Can I harvest their gecko meat? What's up with the music? It's not that deep.

658
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:55,880
Wait. Okay, I'm getting closer.

659
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:06,280
Yes, sometimes. Oh, I'm on auto run if I press Q. Wait, how do I stop? Okay.

660
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:12,760
Am I, did I walk past it?

661
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:19,720
Hello?

662
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:27,720
What the fuck is attacking me? What are these?

663
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:36,120
How do I?

664
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:47,480
Oh, what the fuck? I just rocked that bug. I don't stop.

665
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:54,360
So, oh, I have like a certain percentage. All right.

666
01:24:58,440 --> 01:24:58,760
Pew.

667
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:03,640
All right.

668
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:07,800
Uh.

669
01:25:17,240 --> 01:25:19,560
Is this it? This is a fucking bush.

670
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:31,800
I can see myself live in here. This is a nice area. Is it this?

671
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:37,160
Bro, what is? I can't even find a damn plant.

672
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:48,120
I'm literally right on top of it. I don't. This is a dead tree.

673
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:52,120
Roy, what?

674
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:56,120
How do I?

675
01:25:56,920 --> 01:26:06,040
Brother, look down. I'm standing on it next to the tree stump.

676
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:11,400
Oh, okay. I'm looking down.

677
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:15,400
How do I?

678
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:22,840
Guys, what the fuck?

679
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:27,320
Playing first person?

680
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:37,320
I don't. Am I an idiot? I don't.

681
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:45,800
Do I see the three plants hidden? I am playing Skyrim.

682
01:26:46,680 --> 01:26:52,280
They're brown with green stalks. Is it these things? I can't grab them.

683
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:59,880
I'm in the fucking tree. No, behind me? Oh.

684
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:14,120
Uh, okay. I'm not in this. I'm blind. I'm just a little bit blind. Okay. Like, leave me.

685
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:17,640
Let me live my life.

686
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:28,120
Wasn't expecting cowgirl sheebie. Howdy. It's me, Shabelle.

687
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:34,840
I don't know where I'm going. I don't know what I'm looking for. I should just put

688
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:38,520
myself in this fucking dumpster because that's where I belong. I'm a piece of trash.

689
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:42,280
Just kidding. You be riding there with me because you're literal trash.

690
01:27:53,080 --> 01:27:56,440
The game like others brown for the times. What does that mean?

691
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:02,120
It's that little dust devil. Can that hurt me? No.

692
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:09,960
Am I fighting something?

693
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:20,280
What the fuck is this targeting system? Like, I can't hit shit.

694
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:27,160
Like, I don't... I want to hit this head.

695
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:33,720
How many?

696
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:41,320
What was that?

697
01:28:45,480 --> 01:28:46,200
Can I eat it?

698
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:54,040
I can't eat it. It looks like crab and I want crab.

699
01:28:56,920 --> 01:29:04,840
Brown scale. Oh, okay. I didn't know that. What the hell are these things?

700
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:17,560
I'm fighting a fucking fly. Why is everything in slow mo? This is literally like...

701
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:21,400
Oh, wait. I forgot that they also made the same game. I was like, why is this so much like

702
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:24,040
Skyrim? And I'm like, because I'm an idiot and they made the same thing.

703
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:30,200
Up you. I'm just going to waste all my ammo.

704
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:36,520
I'm standing still.

705
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:41,080
Danger. Oh my god. Can I just fucking punch it?

706
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:46,360
Anyways, whatever. Let me just...

707
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:52,440
Can I have that lantern? Is that a can? I spanked up a can.

708
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:57,000
Does my health regen or do I need like a Stimpac?

709
01:29:58,440 --> 01:30:01,000
Bro, do I literally have to target every time?

710
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:09,240
How are you still alive?

711
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:15,080
I can't even see.

712
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:21,480
That's my grave. Yes, I could tell. The fact I like...

713
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:27,000
I shoot something head on like it's in my crosshair perfectly and I still

714
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:30,040
fucking... Is there just an insane bullet drop off?

715
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:34,120
They really just want me to use this each time. Let me just do body.

716
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:37,880
Shoot again. Thank you.

717
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:41,880
This is such a weird mechanic. Is this it?

718
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:44,840
I did it.

719
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:52,280
See, this is why most modern games make it so objects go if you interact with them.

720
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:54,680
Oh, understandable. Thank you for the don't know.

721
01:30:56,600 --> 01:31:01,000
How do you hit the brain? I don't know. Bullet drop doesn't even exist.

722
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:12,040
Because like... Do I... Is it because I'm not looking down sights? Is there another one? Hold on.

723
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:22,040
I'm literally gonna like... To be a little bit ahead. Okay,

724
01:31:22,040 --> 01:31:23,400
so I just have to be a little bit above.

725
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:35,400
I feel a pain in this for a reason. Understandable.

726
01:31:39,640 --> 01:31:43,320
At least I have a shit ton of ammo for no reason. I bet she's gonna take the gun

727
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:45,080
back from me though. What?

728
01:31:47,960 --> 01:31:49,240
Can I rebuild my character?

729
01:31:50,120 --> 01:31:51,880
Oh, let's change.

730
01:31:53,080 --> 01:31:55,400
Have you Asian? Never mind.

731
01:31:59,240 --> 01:32:01,080
What are the Caucasian faces look like?

732
01:32:05,080 --> 01:32:06,680
Okay, they all look goofy.

733
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:13,800
How do I get out of here? No, wait.

734
01:32:14,920 --> 01:32:17,080
Hell, can I cancel?

735
01:32:19,480 --> 01:32:26,600
Hell, spam next.

736
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:30,760
No, I have to do this again.

737
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:35,880
All right, well, I gotta remember what I am. Hold on. I gotta be Hispanic.

738
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:43,080
Next. I can customize? What?

739
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:53,240
What was I, this one? Yes, I was. And then I do my hair color, honey.

740
01:32:59,880 --> 01:33:01,720
Not pecan, honey.

741
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:11,960
And then let me change the hairstyle. What was I? Seductress. Perfect.

742
01:33:12,840 --> 01:33:14,840
Wait, I want to see if I can customize my...

743
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:22,200
Behind my eyes are blue. You see my blue eyes?

744
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:30,120
Okay. I look like I'm blind, but that's fine. I can have a tough moment.

745
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:36,840
Yeah. What?

746
01:33:42,920 --> 01:33:44,280
I have to do all this again?

747
01:33:54,760 --> 01:33:57,160
Okay, let me go look in my vault and see what I did.

748
01:34:01,080 --> 01:34:01,640
Please hold.

749
01:34:01,640 --> 01:34:10,200
Hold. Where is it?

750
01:34:23,480 --> 01:34:27,800
Okay, somebody write this down. Three, four, seven, seven, five, six, eight.

751
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:37,880
I didn't even need you guys. I memorized it because I'm a fucking baller.

752
01:34:39,960 --> 01:34:43,800
Oh, yes, that was fine. And then I have wild wasteland.

753
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:47,880
Finished.

754
01:34:49,880 --> 01:34:51,880
All right, don't worry about it.

755
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:54,600
And then I have wild wasteland.

756
01:34:58,440 --> 01:35:02,600
Finished. All right, no, never let me do that again.

757
01:35:04,680 --> 01:35:11,560
Three, six, seven, five, three, oh, wait, no. Six, eight, seven, five, three, oh, nine, nine.

758
01:35:13,640 --> 01:35:18,440
Oh, what do I do now? I just go in this direction.

759
01:35:22,280 --> 01:35:24,360
Do I get a horse?

760
01:35:28,520 --> 01:35:33,160
Save then look at quests. Save. Save. I have a thousand saves.

761
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:41,960
There are no horses. I should just play Red Dead Redemption. What is this?

762
01:35:45,480 --> 01:35:51,400
I always move on foot. What the hell? Is that a charge?

763
01:35:52,840 --> 01:36:01,880
The world might explode by Jesus still lives. He has risen just like my pee pee map.

764
01:36:05,320 --> 01:36:08,520
Oh, it's scrolling the fucking

765
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:20,760
chat. All right, let's travel, boys. Wait, you guys said I need to check.

766
01:36:22,520 --> 01:36:27,800
Quests. Bring the Brock flood. Oh, I have to give that back to her.

767
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:37,800
And then find the man that tried to kill you. But this is back in the saddle.

768
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:44,600
Why would they do this to me? Why would they lie? Now I'm just going to walk fast.

769
01:36:45,720 --> 01:36:47,160
Watch out for scorpions.

770
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:55,720
Red lines are enemies. Well, it looks like I'm fine then. I was wondering what those were.

771
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:00,840
Oh, I see. I see. I see.

772
01:37:04,920 --> 01:37:10,040
How did I get all the way over here? How did she get over there? I feel like I didn't travel that far.

773
01:37:10,440 --> 01:37:19,240
The horses went extinct, but we have fucked up cows. Make that make sense.

774
01:37:22,120 --> 01:37:28,520
Do I get a car? Can I get a little bicycle? Just give me a just give me a mountain bike.

775
01:37:29,240 --> 01:37:32,520
And we got roads.

776
01:37:37,640 --> 01:37:43,400
Empty arrows are unfound locations, understood. I follow two of a car.

777
01:37:48,120 --> 01:37:54,200
No vehicles at all. I'm about to install some mods. Is that a dude? Is he friendly? Can I kill him?

778
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:58,600
Can I pickpocket him? No, I won't do it. I'll fight the urge.

779
01:38:03,560 --> 01:38:10,680
Heal. Heal. Did I fall damage? Yep. Guys, I have fall damage.

780
01:38:15,080 --> 01:38:19,400
Let me see what you got. Yeah, these will do. Just fine. Just fine.

781
01:38:20,440 --> 01:38:23,480
I don't like how you said that. I'm going to be making something folks on the trail call healing

782
01:38:23,720 --> 01:38:26,920
powder. Okay. Come on over to that campfire now. Give it a try.

783
01:38:28,360 --> 01:38:31,960
Let's gather around the campfire. I'm literally right fucking next to it.

784
01:38:32,920 --> 01:38:41,800
All healing powder except I can make anti-venom. How many? One.

785
01:38:42,920 --> 01:38:46,680
Hey, that's not bad. See all it takes to make a recipe is the right ingredients.

786
01:38:46,680 --> 01:38:51,960
Why is your name Sunny Smiles? You don't smile at all. You know you should smile more.

787
01:38:53,480 --> 01:38:57,960
Thing to get is it's all the same idea. You just need to find the right place to set up shop

788
01:38:57,960 --> 01:39:03,400
workbench or reloading bench whatever. Well, I hope that's enough to get you started. Okay. I'm

789
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:08,360
heading back now. Hope I didn't miss anything good on the jukebox. Sian would never forgive me.

790
01:39:08,920 --> 01:39:15,320
She's a dog. Trudy. She's the bartender up at the prospector. Kind of the town mom. Okay. She likes

791
01:39:15,320 --> 01:39:19,320
to meet newcomers. Cool. She'd be cross with me if I didn't ask you to poke your head in and say hi.

792
01:39:19,880 --> 01:39:22,920
Yeah. Did you heal your dog yet?

793
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:29,480
I'm taking your dog. You are an abusive parent.

794
01:39:30,280 --> 01:39:33,000
Wait, how is my Tamagotchi doing? I don't even know where it went.

795
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:37,640
I don't know where my Tamagotchi. Oh, I found it. Let's check on my Tamagotchi.

796
01:39:38,600 --> 01:39:52,440
Oh, my God. Why does it look like that? It looks like a

797
01:39:54,760 --> 01:39:58,200
poop. It really looks like a piece of poop. I'm not even joking. It looks like a piece of poop.

798
01:39:59,640 --> 01:40:01,640
I have a shit child.

799
01:40:08,360 --> 01:40:15,800
Why is my child ugly? The first one was the best one of them all. I think I just keep jinxing myself.

800
01:40:17,320 --> 01:40:22,520
Here, have some food. Eat some cereal. That's all. Oh, actually, I kind of want to eat some cereal.

801
01:40:24,360 --> 01:40:31,000
Should we take a cereal break, boys? Because I've done so much so far. I just finished this

802
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:36,840
tutorial, so I think I deserve a treat. I think I deserve some Cheerios.

803
01:40:41,960 --> 01:40:49,800
If you want a break already. Listen, I have been doing nothing all day. I deserve a break.

804
01:40:50,120 --> 01:40:52,120
I

805
01:40:57,720 --> 01:41:01,560
wish it would rain today. I want some rain. I want to watch a scary movie.

806
01:41:05,400 --> 01:41:15,080
My boobies hurt. What kind of Cheerios? I don't know. Cheerio kind? Is this honey not Cheerios?

807
01:41:15,560 --> 01:41:17,560
Oh

808
01:41:19,160 --> 01:41:21,160
What do you want me to say?

809
01:41:29,880 --> 01:41:36,040
Can we watch a scary movie too? No. Only me. I was debating.

810
01:41:37,560 --> 01:41:44,920
I was debating whether or not to go to the movies to see Alien Romulus by myself. And I'm just like,

811
01:41:44,920 --> 01:41:53,240
uh-oh. I'm thinking about it.

812
01:42:05,640 --> 01:42:09,720
Honey, not take the hair and plush with. Oh, I could do that.

813
01:42:15,880 --> 01:42:17,880
I

814
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:26,520
know my dad's too scared to see it. I told you guys before

815
01:42:27,880 --> 01:42:29,400
I told you guys before

816
01:42:30,600 --> 01:42:37,400
that I brought it up my mom. I was telling my mom. Hold on. My model froze again. I was telling my mom.

817
01:42:37,800 --> 01:42:39,800
Um

818
01:42:41,320 --> 01:42:43,320
Not like I wanted to see Alien Romulus

819
01:42:44,360 --> 01:42:49,640
and then my mom I'm like, but I don't have anybody to go with and then my mom looks at my injustice to my dad

820
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:53,960
and I was just like, oh, why didn't you go with her? And I looked at her and I'm like, dad's a pussy.

821
01:42:54,680 --> 01:42:56,680
He's too scared.

822
01:42:58,120 --> 01:43:00,120
I said that verbatim.

823
01:43:03,640 --> 01:43:05,960
And then he cursed me out in Creole and they don't know what he said.

824
01:43:08,280 --> 01:43:10,280
Um

825
01:43:13,480 --> 01:43:18,760
And I said, mom, we were literally watching the previews before Deadpool and Wolverine

826
01:43:19,400 --> 01:43:22,280
in the Alien Romulus trailer came on and he started screaming

827
01:43:23,240 --> 01:43:24,680
his grown ass

828
01:43:24,680 --> 01:43:26,680
six five

829
01:43:26,680 --> 01:43:32,440
bald buff black man was just screaming like a little girl. You guys heard his high like his voice gets really high

830
01:43:32,440 --> 01:43:36,040
That's what it sounded like in the theater. He was like, ah, I'm like dad shut up

831
01:43:37,480 --> 01:43:43,560
He would just be closing his eyes the entire time

832
01:43:48,280 --> 01:43:50,840
My dad's a scaredy cat. He can't handle scary movies

833
01:43:54,440 --> 01:43:57,720
Can I take on a xenomorph sexually? Yes, physically. No

834
01:43:59,480 --> 01:44:01,480
Couldn't beat the wolf's allegations

835
01:44:01,880 --> 01:44:04,840
Like I'm I like I can be a wolf wolf sometime

836
01:44:07,640 --> 01:44:09,640
No

837
01:44:11,160 --> 01:44:12,440
How about my mom?

838
01:44:12,440 --> 01:44:17,160
Honestly, you know, my mom is really funny because my mom is very she hates my mom hates violence

839
01:44:17,560 --> 01:44:19,560
She hates anything with violence

840
01:44:19,960 --> 01:44:25,960
And like when me and my dad watch like a more violent movie or whatever she like will be like, I can't watch this

841
01:44:25,960 --> 01:44:27,400
This is gonna give me nightmares

842
01:44:27,400 --> 01:44:31,880
But then one day I go and visit and my mom's watching like seal team

843
01:44:32,520 --> 01:44:37,240
On whatever platform it is and I'm like I'm like mom soldiers are dying in this

844
01:44:38,040 --> 01:44:42,440
And being shot, but you can watch it make that make sense mother. She's like, I don't know

845
01:44:43,640 --> 01:44:45,080
I don't know why

846
01:44:45,080 --> 01:44:48,200
And I'm like if you have night terrors don't come crying to me

847
01:44:51,960 --> 01:44:57,240
I want to play amnesia what what's happening here my camera is spinning. It's fine

848
01:44:58,040 --> 01:45:00,520
AFK spin. I'm gonna get fucking motion sick stop

849
01:45:02,840 --> 01:45:05,400
Terrorizer, I don't know. I there's never been a

850
01:45:06,120 --> 01:45:08,120
Uh horror movie. I haven't been able to finish

851
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,480
Um, although like I've never seen the saw movies

852
01:45:12,680 --> 01:45:16,680
I don't mind body horror, but like I don't I don't think I don't like it when it's like realistic

853
01:45:17,080 --> 01:45:19,640
Although that's a lie because I like gore. I like gore a lot

854
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:22,760
Maybe maybe I need to watch saw

855
01:45:24,600 --> 01:45:26,600
I've heard of terrorizer

856
01:45:27,720 --> 01:45:31,080
Grandparents pretty religious of watching gory ass horror movies. That's kind of funny

857
01:45:31,960 --> 01:45:33,960
I

858
01:45:34,200 --> 01:45:41,720
First few saw is our peak. Maybe we'll do a spooky spooky movie watch along. Um during

859
01:45:42,920 --> 01:45:44,920
October

860
01:45:46,120 --> 01:45:49,560
Cabin, oh, I like cabin in the woods cabin in the woods is really good because I like the twist

861
01:45:51,240 --> 01:45:53,240
Yeah

862
01:46:02,520 --> 01:46:04,520
I

863
01:46:08,760 --> 01:46:11,240
Terrorizer splatter gore porn effects no purpose

864
01:46:13,880 --> 01:46:15,880
Odd

865
01:46:21,160 --> 01:46:25,080
Thoughts on religious horror is that considered a religious horror

866
01:46:29,320 --> 01:46:31,320
I did it's just like it's just

867
01:46:31,720 --> 01:46:36,520
I like the conjuring. I don't think it's religious horror. It's just like it's just like spiritual horror

868
01:46:48,440 --> 01:46:51,240
Exorcist, well, yeah, I could see the exorcist

869
01:46:51,240 --> 01:46:53,240
Oh

870
01:47:00,040 --> 01:47:02,040
No, I'm spinning again

871
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:10,920
That's scary so religious maybe that's what makes sense. Okay, hold on. Let me get let me get some cereal

872
01:47:11,720 --> 01:47:13,720
So we heal in milk. Oh

873
01:47:21,240 --> 01:47:23,240
Oh

874
01:47:48,360 --> 01:47:50,360
You're not liquid

875
01:47:51,240 --> 01:47:53,240
Oh

876
01:48:07,400 --> 01:48:09,400
Did you get the people

877
01:48:12,760 --> 01:48:17,000
Right now see the chair. Hi, I can't get to you though because you're under the chair

878
01:48:17,720 --> 01:48:19,720
I'm

880
01:48:38,200 --> 01:48:41,800
Dinner love me some

881
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:56,000
My tummy's probably never hurt.

882
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:59,000
Because of the milk.

883
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:04,000
I kind of just want something sweet and funny, not Cheerios.

884
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
It's all that I have.

885
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
Here's my boobie.

886
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
Metro boobie.

887
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:26,000
What's for dinner? Cereal?

01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:36,000
No lactate? No.

890
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
Yes.

891
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:50,000
Why would I have cereal with yogurt?

892
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:01,000
We're in spin without the egg.

893
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:05,000
There's a lot of new people here.

894
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
What's up with that?

895
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
Who are you?

896
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:17,000
Hi, my name's Shibi Kanbum.

897
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:21,000
I am lactose intolerant, but I also eat cereal,

898
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:25,000
even though it's lactose-free milk and it's leaving me my tummy hort.

899
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
I'm your favorite girl failure dom.

900
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
Avila's Gen 1 Indulge.

901
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
New Vegas delivers?

902
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
Interesting.

I have three cats, Boomi, Fia, and Reina.

907
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:09,000
Reina's staring at me right now because she wants my cereal.

908
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000

but I'm watching right now because of the New Vegas.

913
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
I'm not even lying. That's what Reina looks like right now.

914
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
What the fuck just happened?

915
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
Reina, stop staring at me like this.

916
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
Crunch, crunch.

917
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
Mm-mm, delicious.

918
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
Mm-mm, delicious.

919
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
I know it's an idle camera pan.

920
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:28,000
I mean my model in-game, not my vtuber model.

921
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:32,000
It just kind of fell for a second.

922
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:35,000
I was up in the air, then I landed on the ground.

923
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
Oh my god.

924
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
What the hell?

925
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
What are you doing?

926
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
Okay.

927
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
Boomi, you can't have it.

928
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:05,000
Boomi's on my desk trying to take my cereal out.

929
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
He's going for it.

930
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
I don't know why it didn't attack me.

931
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:34,000
Do you ever have a little bit of warm milk left in your bowl?

932
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
So you put some more cereal?

933
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
That's what I like to do.

934
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:52,000
What a healthy, balanced dinner.

935
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
Or dinner.

936
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
Or dinner.

937
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
Boomi, go away.

938
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:03,000
My son is trying to steal my cereal.

939
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:14,000
Boomi, Boomi, right now this is not for you.

940
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:29,000
I will drink the extra milk.

941
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
And I will like it.

942
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:40,000
I don't like soggy cereal.

943
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
That's gross.

944
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
That's disgusting.

945
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:48,000
You ever put milk in the cereal bag to moisten the cereal?

946
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
Anyways.

947
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:57,000
You want me to reinforce his bad behavior by giving him milk?

948
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
No.

949
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
Ow.

950
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
Glutty.

951
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
Glutty.

952
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
Glutty.

953
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
Glutty.

954
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
Glutty.

955
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:24,000
Glutty usually meal prep and I will do it based off of that.

956
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:38,000
Milk is bad for kitty tummies.

957
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:41,000
Raina throws up when she has milk.

958
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
Glutty.

959
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:51,000
I have barbecue mac and cheese.

960
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
What?

961
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
Hello?

962
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
Gunfire?

963
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:14,000
You really want to kill my cat, Tom?

964
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:23,000
Yogurt and cereal?

965
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
I've never tried it.

966
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
I like yogurt and granola.

967
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
Actually.

968
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:33,000
No, one time I ran out of granola so I put honey bunches of oats.

969
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
No.

970
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:53,000
Boomi's lawyer is trying to kill his own client.

971
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:00,000
He's just trying to take the money and run.

972
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:09,000
What is Ranger mode starving?

973
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
I can have, I have to eat?

974
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
I keep getting escaped.

975
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
La la la.

976
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:36,000
It's night time. The sky is pretty.

977
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:40,000
The stars at night are being bright.

978
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:44,000
Deep in the heart of Texas.

979
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:51,000
That's a difficulty? No, thank you.

980
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
And the burp.

981
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:01,000
Are you ready for the burp?

982
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:06,000
Okay, a little bit of Cheerio came up with that.

983
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
That didn't sound that good.

984
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
I also forced it.

985
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:13,000
I can fast travel? Impressive.

986
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
Ten out of ten.

987
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:18,000
That wasn't even that good.

988
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
That wasn't even a good burp.

989
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:27,000
There was no base in that. That was all treble.

990
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:32,000
I like my beads fast in my base down.

991
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
Where's the other one?

992
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
Hello?

993
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
Is that one?

994
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
I definitely scrubbed my tongue too hard.

995
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
My tongue hurts.

996
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:49,000
Unless I scratched it when I had those dream crab legs in my sleep.

997
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
Well, I like Ten's.

998
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
I like being spoiled.

999
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
How do I feel so far about the game?

1000
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
I'm just playing Wasteland Skyrim, so I like it.

1001
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
Hey.

1002
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
Perhaps.

1003
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
I need to get to Prim.

1004
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
With the roller coaster.

1005
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
You never know who you'll run into.

1006
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:30,000
Off the road, you'll probably start running into hostile wildlife.

1007
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:33,000
My advice would be to stick to the highway when you can.

1008
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
Okay.

1009
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
That's fine.

1010
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
Bye.

1011
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:42,000
Until next time.

1012
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
Thanks, ma'am.

1013
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
Excuse me.

1014
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
You have a weird look about you.

1015
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
Piss?

1016
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
Why does he want piss?

1017
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:07,000
That's weird.

1018
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
Hi.

1019
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:13,000
You have really weird concealer.

1020
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
What was that all about?

1021
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
Oh.

1022
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
Not Ringo Star?

1023
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
Not Piss Man?

1024
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
Why is everything so foggy in here?

1025
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
I feel like I'm looking through dirty glasses.

1026
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
Where is he now?

1027
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
Wow, that's crazy.

1028
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
Thank you for giving me that information.

1029
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
Now I'm going to go sell that.

1030
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
I don't know.

1031
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
I'll kill him.

1032
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
Shabelle has a clock coma.

1033
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
I can sell him out.

1034
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
I just want to be a shit human being in this game.

1035
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
That's why they shot me in the head.

1036
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
What are you going to do?

1037
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
Powder gangers.

1038
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
They sell crack.

1039
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
I'm going to show them a sticker.

1040
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
Dynamite up your ass.

1041
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
Okay.

1042
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
The robot?

1043
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:53,000
I know that thing as much as anyone else around here.

1044
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
What?

1045
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:56,000
You don't like him?

1046
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:59,000
It acts friendly enough, but I don't trust that whole cheerful cowboy act.

1047
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
There's a robot?

1048
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:02,000
Very creepy.

1049
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:05,000
Go, go, powder gangers.

1050
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
Did Ranger Rejects come out?

1051
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
I want to watch that.

1052
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:12,000
I should just read the manga, but what does he actually do?

1053
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
Other than rolling around once in a while,

1054
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
it doesn't do anything useful as far as I can tell.

1055
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
I don't know why it took an interest in you,

1056
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
but I'd be careful.

1057
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
It's never helped anyone before.

1058
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
Okay.

1059
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:27,000
It was here when I took over the saloon seven years ago.

1060
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
Some people have said its owner lived here,

1061
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
but no one knows who it was.

1062
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:34,000
It's fine by me.

1063
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
I don't like that I have to say,

1064
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:39,000
let's talk about something else instead of just me just saying the dialogue,

1065
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
something like myself.

1066
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:45,000
You know anything about him?

1067
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
Not much other than there are a bunch of freeloaders

1068
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
who expected a few rounds on the house.

1069
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
I was able to get them to pay up though.

1070
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
Of course, one of the great cons did not-

1071
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
He dug me out of the grave?

1072
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:56,000
What the fuck?

1073
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:59,000
It hasn't been working since.

1074
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:02,000
So I could have just suffocated.

1075
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
I don't care about your radio.

1076
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
They were having some kind of argument about it,

1077
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
but the guy in the checkered coat kept shushing-

1078
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:09,000
I'm going to say it.

1079
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
I don't care that you broke your elbow.

1080
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:14,000
If that's the case, I can't say I blame them

1081
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
for not wanting to go back.

1082
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
What's your function?

1083
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
That whole area is overrun with the kind of critters

1084
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
that just get mad if you shoot them.

1085
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
Merchants avoid that whole stretch of I-15

1086
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
like it's radioactive,

1087
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
which it could be for all I know.

1088
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
Yeah?

1089
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
So where are they headed?

1090
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:35,000
I didn't hear exactly, but the leader was talking about the strip.

1091
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:38,000
Fella wants to get there and avoid the 15.

1092
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:39,000
He'd have to go east.

1093
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:42,000
What am I, California?

1094
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
That was weird. Her voice changed.

1095
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
What do you got for sale?

1096
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
Dirty water.

1097
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
Is rads radiation?

1098
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
Iguana on a stick!

1099
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
Junk food.

1100
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:02,000
Moonshine, meeting people.

1101
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:06,000
Should I buy any of these from her?

1102
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:16,000
I just want to set the world on fire.

1103
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:20,000
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

1104
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
Bye bye.

1105
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
Be careful out there.

1106
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:30,000
Yeah, I remember watching that in school.

1107
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:33,000
That's the only thing I remember.

1108
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:39,000
Not from school, I mean, like, just that, like, I don't know why they're playing a set video.

1109
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:42,000
Gentlemen.

1110
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
Interesting.

1111
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
The women's bathroom is delectable,

1112
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:51,000
what the gentleman's bathroom has seen better days.

1113
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
Can I piss in here?

1114
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
Did I just drink from the toilet?

1115
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:07,000
I thought I clicked activate.

1116
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:12,000
Why am I drinking from the toilet?

1117
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:19,000
How am I drinking from the sink?

1118
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
It's not even on.

1119
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:27,000
Might as well, I was drinking water, how I heal.

1120
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:30,000
That doesn't make any sense to me, but okay.

1121
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:33,000
Uh, yep, I did notice my HP rises.

1122
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:36,000
Who is calling me? It's spam.

1123
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:39,000
Hold on, I'll pick up.

1124
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
Fuck your mother!

1125
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
Fuck your mother!

1126
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
Fuck your mother!

1127
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
Fuck your mother!

1128
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,000
Fuck your mother!

1129
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,000
Fuck your mother!

1130
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,000
Fuck your mother!

1131
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
Fuck your mother!

1132
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
Fuck your mother!

1133
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
Okay.

1134
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
And I just hung up.

1135
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:04,000
I'm gonna start doing that next time I get spam calls in stream.

1136
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
Watcha be like...

1137
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
I don't even know.

1138
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
Watcha be like...

1139
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
Watcha be like...

1140
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
What if like...

1141
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:25,000
What if Grog girl was calling me and she just...

1142
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
I just yelled in her face.

1143
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
Where do I go?

1144
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:38,000
Do I have to do this?

1145
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
Okay.

1146
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:49,000
I don't really care about that, I'll track that instead.

1147
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:52,000
I don't care about that silly quest.

1148
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:56,000
Honestly, I'm not someone who really cares about side quests a lot.

1149
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:02,000
I prefer just to stay on the main quest.

1150
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:11,000
So there's something right there, and there's something over there.

1151
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
So Prim's over there.

1152
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
I know.

1153
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
What's that?

1154
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:23,000
I want to know what it is.

1155
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:30,000
Do I turn a little bit?

1156
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
This way?

1157
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
Okay, let's go.

1158
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
I have a laser pistol.

1159
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
I don't...

1160
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,000
I don't need no laser pistol.

1161
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
I got a fucking...

1162
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,000
Puppy!

1163
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:50,000
Cheyenne, you're coming with me!

1164
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:54,000
Oh, she still didn't heal you yet.

1165
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
Anyways.

1166
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:07,000
They're like a weird hop skip jump.

1167
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
Oh, is this the robot?

1168
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
Hey.

1169
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:17,000
Yes, sir! Thank you for digging me out of that grave!

1170
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:24,000
But apparently you never helped anyone before.

1171
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:29,000
I don't like your fucking crazy eyes.

1172
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:35,000
I'm not going to accidentally kill the dog.

1173
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:47,000
Why do you look like Metaton?

1174
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:57,000
Did they base Metaton after you?

1175
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:08,000
Don't make fun of VTuber for so long.

1176
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:11,000
I don't know, he needs to work on his eye rigging.

1177
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
I'm a Securitron.

1178
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:19,000
Robco Security Model 2060B.

1179
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:22,000
He's bigger than my 1070.

1180
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:25,000
Sick, bye!

1181
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,000
Happy Trails!

1182
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:30,000
It's Metaton!

1183
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:33,000
Can I fuck the robot?

1184
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
Um...

1185
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
Anyways.

1186
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:46,000
So I have to walk all the way to Prim?

1187
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:49,000
Okay.

1188
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:52,000
Is the mod for everything?

1189
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:55,000
Later?

1190
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:58,000
I can do another...

1191
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:01,000
I can fuck the robot in this game.

1192
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:04,000
Because VT got me acting some kind of way, you know?

1193
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:07,000
Maybe in a robot mood.

1194
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:10,000
I don't even know how that works, I have to look that up.

1195
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:14,000
Can somebody recommend me some Robohentai?

1196
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:22,000
I've just suddenly decided I want to be into it.

1197
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:25,000
But I don't know the schematics.

1198
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:28,000
How do I take out my gun?

1199
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:31,000
My pistol.

1200
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:37,000
His name is Fisto!

1201
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:40,000
Click to draw. No, but that just draws my other gun.

1202
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:43,000
So if I go to the items, and I go to weapons...

1203
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
A pew pew!

1204
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
What?

1205
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,000
Okay.

1206
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:58,000
Well this gun is broken, so what's the point?

1207
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:01,000
I shot it once and it's already fucking broken.

1208
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:06,000
How much ammo do I have?

1209
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:09,000
Okay, I have 20 left.

1210
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:12,000
I've discovered where the ammo counter is.

1211
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:18,000
Don't look at me like that.

1212
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:32,000
I don't like that I can hear whistling.

1213
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:36,000
Okay, there's enemies.

1214
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:39,000
But what kind of enemies?

1215
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:42,000
Seeing enemies?

1216
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:50,000
Little bars, it's durability.

1217
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
Understood.

1218
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:56,000
Enemy spotted.

1219
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:59,000
I think I'm sciency enough.

1220
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:03,000
Because I have the sciency trait, I think.

1221
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:06,000
I shouldn't have said that.

1222
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:09,000
I haven't done much, but I'm getting a little sleepy, I'll be honest with you.

1223
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:12,000
I haven't even really gotten far at all.

1224
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:15,000
But I want to keep playing, but I'm really tired.

1225
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:19,000
I shouldn't have streamed earlier today.

1226
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
I mean, I didn't do that.

1227
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:24,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

1228
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:27,000
What are you doing?

1229
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:30,000
He's standing there menacingly.

1230
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:33,000
You dare approach me?

1231
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:38,000
Sleep stream of the harem, you guys are just going to hear me snore.

1232
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
Stop.

1233
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:50,000
How are you not fucking dead?

1234
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:54,000
Well, I'm going to shoot you in the fucking head.

1235
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:57,000
How about that?

1236
02:12:57,000 --> 02:13:00,000
Jesus Christ.

1237
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:03,000
Anyways, there's another one.

1238
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
What?

1239
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:15,000
Bitch.

1240
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:23,000
You don't care if I don't snore attractively.

1241
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:27,000
You guys think snoring is...

1242
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:30,000
My parents...

1243
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:33,000
My mom woke me up in the middle of the night one time.

1244
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:36,000
She heard me choking because I was snoring so bad.

1245
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:42,000
And then they recorded me snoring because I don't think I've ever snored before.

1246
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:45,000
And I sounded like a fucking monster.

1247
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,000
It's going well.

1248
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:52,000
I think, I don't know.

1249
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:55,000
I'm like skipping like a weirdo.

1250
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:03,000
Is this Prim?

1251
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:07,000
Primrose, Aberdeen.

1252
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:10,000
Okay, cool. Thank you.

1253
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:14,000
Hi. Jesus, am I playing oblivion?

1254
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:17,000
What's going on?

1255
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:22,000
Everyone inside is either dead or in hiding.

1256
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:26,000
What's more, there are two tribes of raiders causing trouble in this area as well.

1257
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:29,000
You'd be safer heading back up to Goodsprings.

1258
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,000
Thanks for the warning.

1259
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,000
Shouldn't you be fucking protecting the town?

1260
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:35,000
I'd love to, but they don't fall under NCR jurisdiction.

1261
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
Even if they did, we're in no shape to protect them.

1262
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,000
So you're useless.

1263
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
Why can't you protect them?

1264
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,000
We don't have the equipment to take out the convicts.

1265
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:44,000
And even if we did...

1266
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
And why are you here?

1267
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
You sound actually useless.

1268
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
He's in a tent down the road.

1269
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
Stay on the west side of the overpass.

1270
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
You don't want to get shot.

1271
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
I don't want to get shot.

1272
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
He's fucking zoomed in on his face.

1273
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
All right.

1274
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,000
I'm so tired.

1275
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,000
I don't know why.

1276
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,000
Oh, I know why.

1277
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
How do I...

1278
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
Can I, like, double-click?

1279
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:21,000
He's in a tent.

1280
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,000
How the fuck do I get in there?

1281
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:25,000
Yeah!

1282
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,000
Yeah!

1283
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
I have to cross that funky little bridge.

1284
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,000
Funky-ah bridge.

1285
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:37,000
Ooh, water?

1286
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
Ooh, water?

1287
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
Can I have it?

1288
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
Empty soda bobble.

1289
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,000
What's a Legion run?

1290
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:01,000
Ooh, watch the mask.

1291
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:03,000
Enjoy!

1292
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:05,000
I haven't seen that moving in a while.

1293
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,000
Who's detected?

1294
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,000
Who has me detected?

1295
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
Who's detecting me?

1296
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
Do you think I'd be able to call in there?

1297
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
Hello?

1298
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
It's fine.

1299
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,000
Hello?

1300
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:31,000
Hello?

1301
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
I can be a little rat.

1302
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:41,000
Can I see?

1303
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:47,000
It's fine.

1304
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:49,000
What are you guys talking about?

1305
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,000
Landmines? I didn't see any landmines.

1306
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
Aw.

1307
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:01,000
Sneak, sneak, sneak, sneak, sneak.

1308
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
Sneak, sneak, sneak, sneak.

1309
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
Sneak.

1310
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
Can I, like...

1311
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
Can I pick up on him?

1312
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
Ah!

1313
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
Hold on, I'm reloading.

1314
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
My eyes closed.

1315
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
I look like a really wonky marbidol.

1316
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
No, I didn't save.

1317
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
Where am I?

1318
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,000
Baker hat.

1319
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
Fine.

1320
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,000
I gotta make my hat bigger.

1321
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,000
Please hold.

1322
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,000
Yippee!

1323
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:09,000
How far back?

1324
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:15,000
What?

1325
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:17,000
How far back did I...

1326
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
Yeah, I don't think it's that bad.

1327
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:24,000
I think it saved automatically when I left the thingy.

1328
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
Yeah, I just have to talk to Victor again.

1329
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
Hold on.

1330
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:32,000
Yeah.

1331
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
We're fine.

1332
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,000
I just have to walk.

1333
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:42,000
I may fall asleep on the way, but that's fine.

1334
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:45,000
What are you doing?

1335
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:49,000
Where is he?

1336
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
Where's the...

1337
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
Huh?

1338
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
Is he over there?

1339
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:09,000
Okay, I think...

1340
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
Marker's Ringo.

1341
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,000
Oh, that's right, and I switched it.

1342
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
Oh, okay.

1343
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
What the hell?

1344
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
Yeah, there he is!

1345
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:39,000
Yeah, there he is!

1346
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
Ron!

1347
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
What is this?

1348
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:58,000
Oh, you don't look too good, brother.

1349
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:01,000
Hi, Medeton!

1350
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:03,000
Howdy, partner!

1351
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
Thanks.

1352
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
Thank you!

1353
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
Yippee-ki-yay!

1354
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
I wish I had a fucking horse.

1355
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:28,000
Where's Torrent when I need him?

1356
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
Let me save.

1357
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:37,000
Why doesn't it auto-save?

1358
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
Turn on the radio?

1359
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
How do I turn on?

1360
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
I

1361
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
Can I turn it off?

1362
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
Oh.

1363
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:11,000
I don't care if the music gets claimed, I'm not really...

1364
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:14,000
I don't make any money from streaming anyways.

1365
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:17,000
I mean, not from like...

1366
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:21,000
I meant like ad stuff, I don't really care.

1367
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:30,000
Yeah, like, most I'll get is like 20 bucks, so it's not a big deal.

1368
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
No, no, no, no, no.

1369
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:46,000
I don't make any money from streaming, guys.

1370
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
Bealur takes every penny.

1371
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
No, kidding.

1372
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:55,000
Our predatory 20% cut.

1373
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,000
No, I'm kidding.

1374
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:59,000
What's that? Can I pick it up?

1375
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,000
Ooh, sure.

1376
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:11,000
We definitely don't have the best cut ever, and that's why everybody thinks they wants to join us.

1377
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,000
Next gen.

1378
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
But don't you worry.

1379
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
We'll make sure...

1380
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:21,000
What the?

1381
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:23,000
This rose from the ground.

1382
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:25,000
We'll make sure...

1383
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:27,000
It's not...

1384
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:30,000
Lemons stealing whores that want to join.

1385
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
That's steal the lemons.

1386
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:37,000
And by lemons, I mean just joining for money.

1387
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:45,000
I think we will...

1388
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:48,000
Strawni and management will have learned a lot from us.

1389
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
And more...

1390
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:55,000
Have even better ideas of how to pick gen 2.

1391
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:58,000
Not that we were bad picks, that's not what I'm saying.

1392
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:05,000
I'm talking about just like an even more improved interview process.

1393
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,000
Am I being attacked?

1394
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
Okay, bye.

1395
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
Is this guy gonna run up on me again?

1396
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:22,000
Here he comes.

1397
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:29,000
Mario, your eye is looking in one direction and your other one is looking over here.

1398
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:39,000
Okay, can I follow you?

1399
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
Watch out.

1400
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
I'm gonna follow you.

1401
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,000
Where are you going?

1402
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
Come back.

1403
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:58,000
Dude, why are you running away from me?

1404
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,000
He just doesn't want to hang out.

1405
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:05,000
Anyways...

1406
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
Cross-eyed Sam.

1407
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
He's doing his best.

1408
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:19,000
Yeah, there was more applicants after Strawni.

1409
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:25,000
People are just like, hey, can I join now and be scouted for gen 2?

1410
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:29,000
And Strawni was like, what?

1411
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:33,000
We literally just started, we're not doing gen 2 yet.

1412
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
But it kind of made me sad.

1413
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:40,000
Because a lot of people didn't want to join or apply as...

1414
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:43,000
Well, not, there was a lot of applicants, don't get me wrong.

1415
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:51,000
But a lot of people didn't think we were going to be successful, so they didn't apply.

1416
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:54,000
They didn't believe in Strawni's vision like me and the other girls did.

1417
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
So that makes me kind of sad.

1418
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:04,000
But I know that there will be more that see us and it will be like, I want to hang out with them.

1419
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
You know, I hope so.

1420
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:13,000
Because like, I didn't enjoy thinking I would make any money.

1421
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:18,000
I just want to be a part of it.

1422
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
I just want to have fun.

1423
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:21,000
Hello?

1424
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,000
What's up with your lips?

1425
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:29,000
You look like somebody, you look like a shaw from the UK.

1426
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:34,000
M to the B, M to the B, M, M, M, M to the B, boom.

1427
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:38,000
Excuse me.

1428
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:41,000
Of course, they waited for you to debut and do stuff.

1429
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:44,000
That's only when the entertaining idea of joining you is just as a predicted.

1430
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:45,000
Yeah.

1431
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:48,000
But don't worry about it.

1432
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:52,000
How do you know Blackpool grime? What do you mean?

1433
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:55,000
That was like a famous TikTok sound, bro.

1434
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:57,000
It's all about passion.

1435
02:25:57,000 --> 02:26:00,000
Passion for fashion.

1436
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:09,000
And also, I think a lot of people, like another reason why I want people to join are just like having a little bit more talent freedom.

1437
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:17,000
I know that I want like, I don't know if I'll be able to look at applicants or anything or look at their videos or look at their answers, but it'll be really cool too.

1438
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:21,000
Because I would like to say like, see what their reasons are for why.

1439
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:25,000
I bet there will be a lot of repeat people who applied last time.

1440
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
So that'll be pretty neat.

1441
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:36,000
I have good judgment.

1442
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:37,000
I don't know.

1443
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:39,000
You think I have good judgment?

1444
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:46,000
I don't know what's wrong with you.

1445
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:49,000
The council will define your fate, decide your fate.

1446
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:53,000
You think me having good judgment?

1447
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:59,000
Honestly, I think I act a lot more crazy on stream than I do off stream because I'm actually pretty normal.

1448
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:04,000
More talents means more collab partners.

1449
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
I judge you guys every day.

1450
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
I watch a lot of YouTubers.

1451
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:11,000
I do like to creep on a lot of people.

1452
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:15,000
Like, I know there are some people that have expressed interest.

1453
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:18,000
Like, I already, like I've already creeped on them.

1454
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:22,000
They're like, wow, the V alert girls seem really neat.

1455
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
I would love to join them one day.

1456
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:29,000
And I'm just like, looks at through your content, sees if you're a V tweeter or not.

1457
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:33,000
Reports back to scrawny, like a little, like a little scout.

1458
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:37,000
She be going through every applicant.

1459
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:38,000
Yep.

1460
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:39,000
I want that Gen 4 slime girl.

1461
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:40,000
Come on.

1462
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,000
Only best is lobster all places.

1463
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:45,000
Yeah.

1464
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,000
My food choices are probably not the best.

1465
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:53,000
But yeah, I would be, where are you from?

1466
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:54,000
Goodbye.

1467
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:55,000
But he looks like a major job.

1468
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:56,000
Does he not?

1469
02:27:57,000 --> 02:28:00,000
But I look for, again, we're only three months in.

1470
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
I don't have to really be thinking about this.

1471
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:08,000
Yeah.

1472
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:09,000
You got to wait till Gen 4.

1473
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:11,000
Does he know?

1474
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,000
I don't think he knows.

1475
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:24,000
Can we get a, like a chav, a chav, a chav, a chav is like a, is like a UK gyaru.

1476
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,000
Look at the gorse on that nose.

1477
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,000
I could sit on it and spam.

1478
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:35,000
The hub.

1479
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:38,000
I call me.

1480
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:43,000
Thanks for nothing.

1481
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:46,000
Sir.

1482
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
Where's the dude that lives in a tent?

1483
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:49,000
Was that you?

1484
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:50,000
Oh, okay.

1485
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:54,000
I was going to say, oh, there's a lot of people in here.

1486
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:56,000
Mind if I take a nap?

1487
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
These look like weird.

1488
02:28:58,000 --> 02:28:59,000
Oh, I can.

1489
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:03,000
These look like weird burgers.

1490
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:07,000
What kind of model you're begging for?

1491
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:09,000
Shrani and Gen 2 said.

1492
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:12,000
Oh, I already know what Gen 2 is.

1493
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:17,000
I've already said I know what Shrani is cooked up and I've seen some concepts already.

1494
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:22,000
And I've already said that Gen 2 is going to be fucking awesome.

1495
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:24,000
So.

1496
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
I look like a weird burger.

1497
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:27,000
Is that a woman?

1498
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:28,000
Are you a woman?

1499
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:33,000
I love you.

1500
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:35,000
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

1501
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:36,000
I've been sorry.

1502
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:37,000
I've been cooked.

1503
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
Shrani is already cooked.

1504
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:42,000
It's a wamana.

1505
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:49,000
I got to take a peek sees because I begged because I bother her a lot.

1506
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
She's a bear, because bunny.

1507
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:53,000
Oh, no.

1508
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:55,000
Cuddle fish.

1509
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:08,000
So, like, if we ever did a thing like guessing Gen 2, I just wouldn't participate because I heard any, no.

1510
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:18,600
know oh yeah no I keep that's like something I would not talk about like I

1511
02:30:18,600 --> 02:30:24,400
wouldn't say what they are um I know I bet Strani will give like a lot of like

1512
02:30:24,400 --> 02:30:34,680
previews and stuff I was very impressed I'm honestly I'm like can I can I have

1513
02:30:34,680 --> 02:30:40,120
like all of those models I would want to be any one of them not that I don't like

1514
02:30:40,120 --> 02:30:43,960
myself mind you but I just can't wait to like you guys to see like you're gonna

1515
02:30:43,960 --> 02:30:50,440
be like they're so cool and different like you guys don't get it you guys

1516
02:30:50,440 --> 02:30:55,160
don't get it like it's actually like they're so unique they're so you like

1517
02:30:55,160 --> 02:31:01,140
they're very unique ideas and I'll give credit to Gull where it's do him and

1518
02:31:01,140 --> 02:31:12,540
Strani cooked um just changed my voice I am all of Gen 4 um but yeah again that

1519
02:31:12,540 --> 02:31:21,020
won't be till next year so sorry boys you gotta wait you gotta wait but I don't

1520
02:31:21,020 --> 02:31:25,020
know if the other girls have seen stuff I just again I just bother Strani a lot

1521
02:31:25,580 --> 02:31:31,940
so if they I don't know if they've bothered her as well um they can just ask

1522
02:31:31,940 --> 02:31:38,180
her and she'll probably show them what is the voice acting this what's your

1523
02:31:38,180 --> 02:31:46,180
business I'm here to skate fast and he asked looks like you're doing a shit

1524
02:31:46,180 --> 02:31:52,260
job there's only three of you four of you that's the problem

1525
02:31:55,940 --> 02:32:00,540
than our Intel initially suggested I'm trying to get some reinforcements here

1526
02:32:00,540 --> 02:32:06,900
maybe I have insider info because I see like I know Strani's like my boss but I

1527
02:32:06,900 --> 02:32:10,940
see her more as like a friend I see her more as a colleague so I talked to her

1528
02:32:10,940 --> 02:32:15,860
pretty I've talked to her almost every morning now and we just chat and she

1529
02:32:15,860 --> 02:32:19,820
asked for feedback and I give my honest opinion and I'm not like a yes man or

1530
02:32:19,820 --> 02:32:24,060
anything I'll challenge Strani like you guys know like when people when she put

1531
02:32:24,100 --> 02:32:28,380
out like the suggestion that we only do one I'm like I think we should do two or

1532
02:32:28,380 --> 02:32:33,980
I should be like we should at least be able to do two or one to limit it not

1533
02:32:33,980 --> 02:32:39,660
have it be as much as patreon I think that's fine so like I'll push back on

1534
02:32:39,660 --> 02:32:47,460
stuff so because the best leaders are people that are acceptance to change and

1535
02:32:47,460 --> 02:32:52,380
being challenged and I feel bad because Strani kind of walked back everything

1536
02:32:52,420 --> 02:32:58,540
because everybody was being pretty rude and I felt really bad about it because

1537
02:32:58,540 --> 02:33:01,740
now she's like do whatever you want I don't want to do like I don't like she

1538
02:33:01,740 --> 02:33:06,740
was getting a lot of hate which was kind of a bummer and I was she was only just

1539
02:33:06,740 --> 02:33:10,340
giving a suggestion to us a little bit ago the convicts there staged a coup

1540
02:33:10,340 --> 02:33:15,820
killed the guards that weren't able to escape but like guys are always we're

1541
02:33:15,820 --> 02:33:21,860
allowed to change our minds and stuff so like I know like I know you guys are

1542
02:33:21,860 --> 02:33:25,380
like me and like you'll have this expectation you'll be disappointed like

1543
02:33:25,380 --> 02:33:29,820
some month I might do only one stream I do too might do not at all maybe some of

1544
02:33:29,820 --> 02:33:33,740
the girls won't do any some of them they will and some will not and blah blah blah

1545
02:33:33,740 --> 02:33:41,860
so it's like you know yeah and I I do have to say I definitely had to do with

1546
02:33:41,860 --> 02:33:46,340
like a lot of the brain worms people had in the audience cuz like on our side we

1547
02:33:46,340 --> 02:33:50,580
were like okay like it's everything's fine blah blah blah blah and this is what

1548
02:33:50,580 --> 02:33:55,660
I meant when I said before like sometimes we'll say something over text and then

1549
02:33:55,660 --> 02:33:58,780
people will take it and kind of like run with their own idea of what's

1550
02:33:58,780 --> 02:34:04,100
happening and I really wish you guys would kind of just like wait for a

1551
02:34:04,100 --> 02:34:12,460
stream or just like ask nicely cuz like all we want is to make you guys happy

1552
02:34:12,460 --> 02:34:18,100
and be nice but if if you guys are rudely questioning things then it makes

1553
02:34:18,180 --> 02:34:22,380
us harder makes it harder for us to communicate properly because like me

1554
02:34:22,380 --> 02:34:31,020
and Mercy and Shawnee and in me and in Icy and Azura um we all communicated fine

1555
02:34:31,020 --> 02:34:36,340
about it like what we were gonna do and not do and whatever and I think people

1556
02:34:36,340 --> 02:34:43,500
just got a little worried um yeah like please please I like if you don't like

1557
02:34:43,500 --> 02:34:47,300
something I beg of you please be kind like we're still learning we're still

1558
02:34:47,340 --> 02:34:52,860
growing as a company Shawnee's never run a Vtuber agency before and does like

1559
02:34:52,860 --> 02:34:58,380
she's very business minded and she wants what best she wants what's best for

1560
02:34:58,380 --> 02:35:03,180
everybody in the company at the same time it's a fine line to manage um but

1561
02:35:03,180 --> 02:35:06,300
please don't like I'm actually getting kind of like sad almost crying right

1562
02:35:06,300 --> 02:35:10,700
now cuz it was really hard to hear like it gets so worked up but she didn't want

1563
02:35:10,700 --> 02:35:18,300
to make anybody mad or anything cuz you don't know how much she does for all of

1564
02:35:18,300 --> 02:35:31,020
us um and I think it like stressed Mercy out a lot and that's why she deleted

1565
02:35:31,020 --> 02:35:36,140
her stuff cuz like I think it was just a little bit overwhelming people's

1566
02:35:36,140 --> 02:35:40,020
responses and it didn't need to be it was honestly like big enough a bigger

1567
02:35:40,020 --> 02:35:48,340
thing of a hullabaloo about nothing you know and you know I like and people can

1568
02:35:48,340 --> 02:35:51,700
understand something one way and people can understand another way and if it's

1569
02:35:51,700 --> 02:35:59,820
up to them how they interpret it but you have to accept like again maybe we need

1570
02:35:59,820 --> 02:36:07,460
to be better at communicating with you guys and I apologize for that um it was

1571
02:36:07,500 --> 02:36:12,820
it was really hard seeing a lot of stuff the people said about everybody it still

1572
02:36:12,820 --> 02:36:17,740
is I don't care if people shit on me I generally don't but when you shit on my

1573
02:36:17,740 --> 02:36:23,020
gen mates it's hard cuz you people don't know how wonderful they are and they

1574
02:36:23,020 --> 02:36:26,700
assumed a lot of stuff behind the scenes

1575
02:36:31,220 --> 02:36:36,180
like they're all very sweet and they want the best for everyone just please

1576
02:36:36,180 --> 02:36:42,420
trust us just please yes believe in us just give us give us a grace please

1577
02:36:46,860 --> 02:36:55,020
just give us a little bit of grace if if something if like if like Amy uses

1578
02:36:55,020 --> 02:37:02,700
her voice differently or or if I see you wants to do like a like just try

1579
02:37:02,740 --> 02:37:06,660
something out like we're just trying to come up with ways to entertain you guys

1580
02:37:06,660 --> 02:37:12,540
we're not trying to hurt anybody or make anybody upset we want to make you happy

1581
02:37:12,540 --> 02:37:29,420
it's like it's so funny like I'll just read like really harsh things about

1582
02:37:29,460 --> 02:37:33,940
myself but I won't give a shit but if I read harsh things about my gen mates it

1583
02:37:33,940 --> 02:37:38,740
makes me sad because I my gen mates are like the kindest people I've ever met

1584
02:37:38,740 --> 02:37:42,020
they only want what's best for us the company and for each other and for you

1585
02:37:42,020 --> 02:37:53,540
guys you have to trust us okay also sorry if you just came here for new Vegas

1586
02:37:53,540 --> 02:37:57,900
stuff or whatever or like for my Elden Street ring streams that totally didn't

1587
02:37:57,900 --> 02:38:04,260
but did have but didn't happen earlier just a little just like they just got a

1588
02:38:04,260 --> 02:38:08,060
lot of like blowback for us like not wanting to do as many fans these

1589
02:38:08,060 --> 02:38:14,340
streams that's that's just like TLDR and people kind of took things of course a

1590
02:38:14,340 --> 02:38:19,260
lot of people are just trolling like doll like there's trolling but then there

1591
02:38:19,260 --> 02:38:29,100
is just like people who I knew like just genuinely were shit heads um mama is

1592
02:38:29,100 --> 02:38:41,100
qui um yeah I care a lot for you guys I also hate seeing you guys upset and when

1593
02:38:41,100 --> 02:38:45,740
you guys are like sad or mad about something or like I'm like I'm like I'm

1594
02:38:45,780 --> 02:38:51,780
like I try to set the record straight as gently and kindly as I can um

1595
02:38:54,780 --> 02:38:57,780
God save the queen

1596
02:39:01,780 --> 02:39:12,180
you're all queese bon kwee kwee um but yeah that's all I ask of you cuz we care

1597
02:39:12,220 --> 02:39:19,500
about you and we want to have fun and we also like want to try new things you

1598
02:39:19,500 --> 02:39:28,260
know I think a lot of pressure is put on us to be at one way or the other and I

1599
02:39:28,260 --> 02:39:35,740
honestly you guys will have the best experience if you let us entertain you

1600
02:39:35,740 --> 02:39:42,100
in try new projects and try new stuff out and try new avenues and try to figure

1601
02:39:42,140 --> 02:39:48,260
ourselves out let that let us cook because when you let us cook it will be a

1602
02:39:48,260 --> 02:39:54,140
lot happier and we'll want to make the best content for you and that's why I

1603
02:39:54,140 --> 02:39:58,260
like I'm very thankful you guys let me dress up in different outfits because

1604
02:39:58,260 --> 02:40:06,340
honestly my last fan base hated that I like I dressed up in different outfits

1605
02:40:06,340 --> 02:40:10,940
and I was sometimes would change my model and I was my PL and people just

1606
02:40:10,940 --> 02:40:16,780
kept shitting on me constantly and but I I like that I can express myself here

1607
02:40:16,780 --> 02:40:23,580
um and then because of that you get the keynote streams like yesterday of me

1608
02:40:23,580 --> 02:40:28,660
just fucking around as a noodle playing retro doob

1609
02:40:32,180 --> 02:40:36,780

1611
02:40:47,820 --> 02:40:55,260
just kind of popped into my head and I probably shouldn't have even acknowledged

1612
02:40:55,260 --> 02:40:59,860

1622
02:42:04,940 --> 02:42:10,380

1630
02:42:49,020 --> 02:42:52,940
powder gangers mostly because they've taken to using the explosives meant to

1631
02:42:52,940 --> 02:42:56,540
clear boulders as weapons they got organized faster than I would have

1632
02:42:56,540 --> 02:43:01,580

2085
03:35:37,140 --> 03:35:39,460

03:36:34,420 --> 03:36:37,940
It actually works. I don't know that song

2097
03:36:58,820 --> 03:37:00,420
Doesn't really make sense either

2098
03:37:00,420 --> 03:37:06,900
You just sounds like you just sound like a freeloader. That's not accurate. I'm on a boat

Uh, do you have any? No, I'm almost dead

2260
03:53:10,420 --> 03:53:14,660
He didn't say I can only hear the gate. I can't hear anything else besides the background music

2261
03:53:16,340 --> 03:53:18,980
Yeah, why is there only game music and no sound?

2262
03:53:22,820 --> 03:53:24,820
Oops, hold on

2263
03:53:32,260 --> 03:53:34,260

2265
03:53:43,700 --> 03:53:45,700
Okay

2266
03:53:50,100 --> 03:53:53,620
I guess the game bugged I guess I suppose so. Yep

2267
03:53:57,940 --> 03:53:59,940
That's weird

2268
03:54:00,420 --> 03:54:02,420
Um

2269
03:54:02,580 --> 03:54:06,740
Do I go talk to them now I pursue assume so we'll never know what they're saying

2270
03:54:08,500 --> 03:54:10,500
Hey

2271
03:54:10,900 --> 03:54:14,660
Well, that was quite an adventure. We taught those convicts a thing or two, didn't we?

2272
03:54:17,700 --> 03:54:23,700
Breaking myself out of a hostage situation not to diminish your role in it, of course, but it was quite thrilling. Can I kill him?

2273
03:54:25,540 --> 03:54:31,540
Problem is there's still no law and pram. What do we do next time ruffians menace us and hold his hostage?

2274
03:54:31,780 --> 03:54:33,780
I

2275
03:54:39,220 --> 03:54:41,220
Or are the qualifications for sheriff

2276
03:54:46,500 --> 03:54:51,300
I don't have to fucking time they didn't shoot the deputy

2277
03:54:52,260 --> 03:54:54,260
I shot the sheriff

2278
03:54:54,500 --> 03:54:56,500
I

2279
03:55:00,660 --> 03:55:02,660
Can I shoot him

2280
03:55:05,780 --> 03:55:09,220
I'm dead I'm gonna restart the game anyways

2281
03:55:20,260 --> 03:55:22,740

2282
03:55:24,260 --> 03:55:26,260

2283
03:55:27,380 --> 03:55:29,220
Am I neighbor screaming?

2284
03:55:29,220 --> 03:55:32,020
I feel like I can hear my neighbor screaming it, but I don't know if I'm the lulu

2285
03:55:32,660 --> 03:55:36,500
I think I got smaller last time so I'm gonna make it a little bit bigger. There we go

2286
03:55:37,860 --> 03:55:41,220
I think it like it scrolled down for some reason

2287
03:55:44,100 --> 03:55:46,100

Where is the love?

2442
04:23:24,260 --> 04:23:26,260
I don't know this is controversial

2443
04:23:27,380 --> 04:23:32,020
It's not really like I'm not getting like I'm not outing anybody. I was just saying how it irritated me

2444
04:23:32,100 --> 04:23:34,100
That's it. Um

2445
04:23:34,420 --> 04:23:40,660
I never talked to the vtuber about it that was involved or any of them. I just I just an observant. I just observed it

2446
04:23:41,460 --> 04:23:43,140
um

2447
04:23:43,140 --> 04:23:48,820
I just spoke about an observation what I'm realizing now is that because I have a bigger platform

2448
04:23:50,100 --> 04:23:51,860
um

2449
04:23:51,860 --> 04:23:58,260
Then when I was like a two view nobody people take what I say and they think I'm making like some sort of statement

2450
04:23:58,820 --> 04:24:04,580
I was just I was just saying an observation and saying that I was irritated. It's not saying my opinion

2451
04:24:05,460 --> 04:24:08,180
Yeah, I know it wasn't asked. Nobody asked. I know

2452
04:24:09,220 --> 04:24:12,260
But I was just on my stream wanting to talk. Okay

04:24:39,140 --> 04:24:41,140
Everything is just so literal

04:24:43,140 --> 04:24:45,860

2461
04:24:48,100 --> 04:24:50,820

Everybody over here. Oh, this isn't safe

2622
04:41:03,300 --> 04:41:05,300
I didn't do a bigger hat

2623
04:41:23,060 --> 04:41:25,060
