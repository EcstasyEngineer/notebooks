I'll speak in which I need to schedule
I want to do a street not a stream uh record. Maybe I'll do that when I'm gone
Yes
So what I'm so some of you who don't know. Hello. Hi. Um, I'm going to be gone for a week from the 18th to the 23rd
I'm going to go see my grandparents, but I wanted to go
Um, I wanted to record something in my absence
So I'm doing an ASMR and I was thinking if I was going to do a gameplay video, but now I'm I think I'm going to
Um, yeah, so week. I'm sorry. Um
I'm gonna do the video with my parents
And I'm gonna have them name v-tubers based off of their designs. So I'll probably grab like, uh,
Like obviously the v alert girls. I'll grab like, um, the people I've collabed with like
Mythos and like you may plus and then I'll grab like some like really popular indies just like iron mouse
um
And stuff and then some like haul alive girls obviously like chiara and nervisa and like some of the newer gen
So I and then see how my parents named them
I think my dad will just be like
I think both of my parents will just be like they have giant boobs
And this be so hung up on their outfits that they won't even
And I'm kind of nervous because I have to tell my my mom can be like my mom's very into fashion and so is my dad
But mostly my mom and she will like my mom again is very conservative
So she'll be like wow, she has her whole entire
Tire boobies out in her, you know, but does he whoa? Okay. This is this is what you do redacted
This is what you do. She me with your spare time
So I think it would be I just don't want my parents to roast people because they might roast people and I'm nervous
I might have to do disclaimer
Um, but yeah, maybe I'll do that
Or we'll set up a donkas. I think I'll do that
Um
Instead of because I was trying to think of like, okay, what's a gameplay video that I can do
I can't think of anything so
We're just gonna
Yeah

Uh, they miss when we're playing and they accidentally like
Although boomie used to like bite me a lot as a kitten, but that's because he's a kitten
boomie's still a kitten. Yeah, you know, I'm talking about you
He's like right behind me. Hi
What do you love to you think about ways to take my soup again?
Oh, you're just you're scratching my carpet. It's not a scratching board, but it's fun
I need to clip your claws
They're very sharp I haven't clicked on them in a month
Fia destroy a bad companion
Okay, this is for I don't hate cats but low key fear of them
So if a cat approaches me I'm likely to look at the owner like what is it doing? What is it?
It's their action mean. Uh, yeah cats body language is a lot
Harder to read than a dogs
Um, really you can tell how a cat is feeling by looking at how their tail is
similar to a dog, um
But like if their tail is up like a little flag that means they're like happy to see you if it's like kind of like
A little like medium that's like they're content if it's a little bit lower. They're just like chilling
But if it's like tucked almost like a dog and they're like very frightened
Are you biting my carpet?
I gave you a spring. Did you knock it under the freaking couch bro? Oh my god, there's like 50 spring like toy springs under my couch
Um, yeah, I tell a lot of gonna cat means irritation
They hate being stared at
I don't know I stare at my cats they they just like just chirp at me when I do
Because they like to stare at me because cats like to stare at you
They're not like dogs where they're like scared of eye contact and stuff. They just like to watch you
Cats wink. Yeah, they give you a little I call it little kitty kisses. I'm like, oh, did you just give me a kiss when they like slowly blink at you?
um
Yeah, they don't like yeah, you don't want to pet a cat if it shows you your spelly because for a cat and they roll over
Onto there. Why am I peeking?
What the hell
Bro, I'm getting pissed
At my microphone right now
I
Because that means they have all their weapons on display
That's so weird, why is my microphone doing that? I'm sorry. I'm just watching the levels
Start staring without blinking is an aggression thing for cats blinking is fine, but for long eye contact is so you get yeah, it's like a
Like dogs where they're like challenging
Boomi, what are you doing?
Now he's under my desk. Hi big man
um
Hello, what are you up to please don't
He's like, I think there's like a wrapper under my desk that he wants
He's just being nosy now. Okay, let me check on my soup
Soup time. Oh, are you following me? You can't have any mister
Do not pop off here or I swear to god you're gonna accidentally hurt yourself. Oh my gosh
He's looking at my soup like I'm about to feed him some food. He's like, oh
I dropped my oyster crackers
Can't
You want a cracker? Yeah, see it's not interesting to you like why are you trying to like get all excited over that?
Okay, I don't have any ginger ale but I do have um seltzer water
I don't have to drink soda too much
One of my cats like belly touches the other does oh, yeah, feel loves her belly rubs. She loves it
So does rena
Oh, it's hot. Oh, it's burn my tongue
Now we
Need to move my taser
And my taser's just on my desk
Put that over here
Do I have a single cat mother?
Why are you shouting?
Hot soup is hot. She discovers the worst. Shut up. It's got taste
Be like a hood rabbit catches you and tases you
Because she thinks you stole her something or whatever
She's just scared the fuck out of you during the collab
Is it taser or taser it's with an s but good question
I'm waiting for my soup to cool, but I'm sad. I put in my little oyster crackers because now they're gonna get soggy
No lasers with an s
ASMR you still should be soup, but you are not a cat
A hood rabbit chases you down and tases you because she thinks you're cute. There you go
Because we um
My mom because there's a lot of rabbits in the area
Uh for my parents live and they live on the edge of like really nice
Suburban area and then really bad
Area and so sometimes a rat my mom will see like rabbit. She's like, ah, it's a hood rabbit
Is there they from the hood? Although I'm literally I don't live remotely near the hood
Oh
Thank you
Boomi all right just heard you jump down from something. I hope you didn't walk on the fucking stove
You didn't okay good
Yeah
Oh
Nice little he boomi likes to jump up and do a little twirl. Yeah, I get for do a little twirl. Oh good twirl

He's like looking for the soup you can't have any
When you do
He's like head butting the air he'll just like jump up on his hind legs and just like head but nothing
Are you gonna hop up here? That's fine. You can't have my soup though
Yeah, it's hot you can tell that it's hot you can't have any milk is a broth is cereal a soup
You

Why are you just chewing on random stuff on my desk?
He's head butting my microphone, I apologize
Pop-tarts are ravioli
That is a fact let him cook I think I have a picture
Boomi was just like chilling on the um
Stove and I'm like can somebody tell my cat to get off the stove and also can someone tell my cat to get out of the
Fridge and the dishwasher and the washing machine because he likes to crawl into those things because he's freaking crazy
What are you chewing on?
Oh
What are you eating is that a bug oh my god
What is it don't eat that keep it alone what is this?
It's like a fucking beetle
Boomi is a 24-7 job usually it's Fia but Fia is chilled out
Usually Fia is like always on my desk and stuff, but
He's chilling by the window right now
I
Can't tell if the soup tastes okay or not it's fine
What are you yelling about
Sir
Why are you yelling in my bathroom? Okay, I don't know if you guys heard me go
Hi, I see
Hello Raiders. Hello Snow Berries. Hello Dada's
I'm eating some soup before I start and we're just chatting and hanging out
Hi, I'm she be caught mom your favorite girl failure nom whip boo whip boo. I don't know yippie
I'm having some chicken old soup and trying to fight off my cat
Because I turned around and he was eating the soup from the pot when I was sitting at my desk
I
See gets it she has a son
She has potato and was it backlash backlash. Voila. I should pronounce it
Snow bunnies
If you're a fan of me and I see your snow bunny
Yeah, what can I?
Balhash
No, not baklava
I hope you had a good stream. I saw that in me in me. I see was playing brats
This is what happens when you give everybody the first letter of the name and then the last letter of the name the exactly same
Sipping sipping on my my seltzer water my ginger lime a seltzer water
and um
Yeah, straw knee she be I see in me. Yeah, I know other people do that. Like I've been called straw knee before
um
Yeah, guys you're playing brats
brats
I remember I used to have like a little mini disc of like the brats angels that came with one of my brats dolls when I had a
brats doll
I think I had chloe and um
There's brats angels or brats forever. I can't remember rock angels. Yeah
I'm her listening to the song. I have to burp. I need to mute
Hi bleep my so wait, no
It'll work. I don't know if it worked
Oh my crap, did I like not bleep it?
Yeah, you get you get bleeped burps. Nobody deserves my burps
The bleep was bleeping she's such a criminal
When I was in the third grade they called me a criminal why because I killed somebody
Start rating bleeps I could do morse code not that I know morse code, but I could figure it out
I
Choked on a noodle
I can see that behind a fit area. What do you mean? Of course mercy. She's literally the Andre
Did I burp I don't remember burping if I did I'm sorry
I
Nice belts bro anytime bro, huh bro fist, but I just like to shove my fist up your butt
affectionately
Yeah, but the undead I already had three what
On an arena stream became a lunch ASMR. I've already told you guys I like to eat with you guys
One because you guys encourage me to eat and I don't like eating alone
See without you I wouldn't have remembered that I have chicken noodle soup Campbell's chicken noodle soup in my cabinet
And I would have probably just kept eating applesauce
Thanks for the fist bro anytime bro
That's literally called a mukbang that's true
Mukbang except I'm not like shoving like an absurd amount of cheese down my throat. I'm just eating Campbell's chicken noodle soup
Yeah, then you wouldn't have the lovely clip that someone probably took of boomi taking my soup
I don't know what the cheese is but well, there's a lot of like cheese pulls and stuff and mukbangs
I couldn't watch mukbangs because then I would want to eat what the people were eating
But like obviously on a smaller scale
So like anytime I watch like a sushi or like a fish related mukbang
I would have to get like sushi
And I'm like this is hurting my wallet
Campbell's sponsor stream
If I could get any sponsor, you know, I'm who my dream sponsor is guess who I want you to guess who my dream sponsor is right now
Let me switch to a gaming
Tampax
Why are people saying tampa why'd you say it twice you get that'd be pretty cool. Um, no
It's smuckers uncrustables
That is my dream
Strawny is my dream sponsor that too
If I could get smuckers uncrustables
Then that would be incredible. I don't know why there's not game sound
Let me figure that out expeditiously and put my headphones in
I want to make a PB and J because it's the novelty bro. It's the novelty
Okay
Imagine me on an uncrustable and I'm just like just hanging out, you know, let me put my ooo mouth on
Why can I only hear
Everything besides the game
Da da da da da da
Um Elden ring where for oh
Is that it? Yeah
Yeah
Okay, I can hear it but now you guys can't
Unless you guys can hear it. I don't know if you can
Devoured okay, cool. Um properties
Is
Nope
It will probably randomly be under music because I don't know why but it puts
Game audio under music on my go xlr. I should probably fix that
Come on play again
Hold on hold on. Hold on. I've got this. I like how I do one thing in it. Why is my mic peaking?
What happened? What happened to my settings from my last collab?
Oh
You heard your first second
Oh, there it is. I might turn that motherfucker down. Holy crap. Sorry
Sorry that game audio is gone now for a second because I need to do something in
YouTube studio. So I'm not so bright
Um, what the shibbity? Where is it? Here it is
There it is
I should have taken a picture of my go xlr settings before they got yuffed up
Cause that's poopy. That's real poopy. That's what I'm gonna say
Is that better? Sure. Okay
Uh
Oh scared me
I'm a star
I guess we actually have to play a game. I'm still sipping. I'm still sipping my poop. Hello. Hi. We started early today
Oh, they don't like about camel chicken noodle soup is that it's so salty
It's too salty for me. How am I supposed to swallow this?
Mmm
You'll show me what? What do you mean? I didn't say anything bad
I
Water it down. Yeah, I think I've done that before
I see
Don't ice cube in there. Well, it's it's already gone. I actually finished it
Which I'm surprised because again, like I said, I've been like very nauseous because of my bed, so
Don't worry, you'll probably fall asleep and I'll be streaming eight hours from now. So
Don't worry about it. You won't miss anything
Crack my back
Time to stretch
Oh
I'm so close to popping it and I can't
Just works
She'll be having eight hours from now after playing the game for three hours
Shit, but my favorite underground indie artist
You best you bested mogul last night. He's the first boss to give you a hard time cool
So you're gonna help me defeat him, right?
Just kidding. I'll I'll fight him
What did you guys say you guys wanted me to fight morgot too and uh
God-free
Okay
Cozy I'm here. I'm ready to rumble. I got my pillow pet mr. Quackerton as my little armrest
Need to adjust I need to bleep
I
Forgot and I can just be you I don't have to bleep it
No burpees for you
Yeah, god-free another talisman pouch
Uh, I also probably should get some memory stones for spells
Because I was doing a lot of oh my god. I need to turn out the game for me
That didn't work at all
There we go turns it down for me and not for you that actually works out. Um
Are you changing our normal burps because I feel I feel like I've been giving you guys too much
And it's time for me to withhold things
You didn't you didn't do anything. I just want to torture you so no burps for you. Um
Um, what was I gonna say?
Oh, so I was doing some research on like best
Things to do. I really watched an hour video about the top 75 best sorceries
And I'm like, okay, do I run around and grab those and I'm like, I don't think I will. Um, but
Going in to I like to do research. Okay for Elden Ring. It's fun
I like to listen to Elden Ring stuff. Um
Going into a mug is going to be difficult
One because my build he's pretty resistant to
So
Yeah, that'll be something unless I get like, uh the comment
I could probably get that
um
Maybe mugged mowed
Uh could also maybe get some frost stuff
I wish I had the video up because it has like a lot of good information about
um
The scaling and stuff for
the sorceries
erm
Let me see
I have to get a different weapon besides the moon veil
to fight
Mogue with because he is resistant to magic
I think like a little bit, but he's I think I'm gonna get
the
Either the the no the either the uji katana or the naga kaiba nakiba naga kiba
I can't remember the name and then do get a poison ash of war for that
um
Because I don't feel like although, I don't know. Do I need higher dexterity for that? I probably do
Brick yeah, he is weak to bleed however
He is he is like 20 magic resisted. I watched a video leave me alone
um
He's like resistant to everything
Yes, he's heavily fit obviously like he is fire resistant, but for best
Build
Yeah, he's 80 percent fire percent
20% oh, okay. I thought it was 40 percent. I can't remember whatever. All right, then we should be fine then with the moon veil
So I don't have to do that
uh, we still have to
go
and
Go to the sofra
I can't pronounce it correct me because I would like to know. I know it's like irish. Um
River well to get the mimic tear
So like oh, I guess so much enough to do
You
Um, then I have to go
Get more got I don't remember why
I have to level the mimic tear. That's also true
So I'm sorry. No, I haven't seofra. Okay. See. I was right seofra. Um
What else gotta get god-free get god
What should we do first?
I remember where I am. I remember what I was doing last or was I?
Oh lovely fire column
God-free
For memory stones. Oh my thing isn't plugged in because she's not plugged in

Talk to the finger lead around table if you're going to be going to the third. Oh, that's right. Okay. I gotta go talk to her

How about my strap hugs your walls, yeah, anyways, who was that?
I want it, I want it, give it to me! Oh fuck, uh, hold on, please,
I guess it's not worth it, so I'll just keep going.
That was fun, that was a fun little excursion, uh, just got jumped, I gotta fight this motherfucker,
or you know, bad to you too, brother, I respect you for that, I'm just gonna spam,
what am I doing, I'm just gonna talk to this guy.
Yes, vike my darling, where for out the vike?
No, nothing, alright, oh there we go.
Oh fuck, um, uh, you know what, I'm actually just gonna run away from you,
because I am too underleveled, wow.

oh, wow, I need that anyways, I need that for Vari's quest,
where is he, oh fuck, yes do that, do that, please just let me touch it,
yes,
is it, no,
fine, I got what I wanted,
got him, yeah, I know I would need that grace,
um, I'm just too underleveled, I'm only level like, what level am I, I think I'm level like 45,
what am I doing,
well 53,
hi lady, you don't look so good, whoa, why can't I see through this pillar, that's
kind of weird, why is it doing that, what,
I got to walk in,
this is OP against NPCs, I know I keep forgetting to use my ash of war on this,
alright let's try it, vike, where you at,
vike,
vike,
vike,
walk in, he, he, he, fuck, can I roll out the way, he, fuck, can I back up,
he, why isn't working, why did it go that way, I, I, I hate this here, I hate it here, no,
why,
you're so, you're do so good, why are you lying to me, why are you lying to me, don't lie to me,
stop,
no I just want to, I already got the grace I needed, but you already got the grace,
you're too, you're, you're late bro, you're late, I already got the grace, I just want to try to kill him,
it's like my, my lock is just like not working,
can you, enough,
she blinded me with madness, she blinded me with madness, I'm too underleveled for that,
he just walks away, he's like yeah, bye bitch,
you just get cooked a little bit, we can get it back,
okay, all right, all right, all right, all right, okay, so we got what we needed there,
what was the other, I was looking for the secret,
he made a secret and left, okay, the restaurant, there's a church of the plague in Kailu that has it,
and there's someone the Altus Plateau, but I won't really do that yet, because Altus
Plateau is not really my priority right now, where the fuck is this,
it's like right in a crooked road, no I'm not fucking, hit, here,
making my way downtown,
like I'm looking at a puzzle piece, where is this, is it right over here,
walking fast, faces passing homebound,
that probably was not the best grace to go to, what are we working towards again,
I'm getting all the sacred tears, not all of them, just like a good chunk,
I should probably look for some golden seeds while I'm at it, I should probably do that too,
I have so many fucking tags, let me back up, so that one's three,
I wish there was a way to just clear all my beacons,
is that a thing, is there a toggle to do that, I highly doubt it, get rid of you,
no, I just wanted to, thank you,
no not those kind of tags, you fucking idiots,
all right, where's one, where's this one pointing at, one is,
what the hell,
there's a one, what is one,
sorry I like have to fix that because it's gonna bother me, so I usually follow the track,
till I find it,
where the fuck is one,
how do I remove all, I'm gonna keep yelling at you unless you tell me,
oh there it is, I found it,
I want some ice cream, I would love some ice cream actually, I have an ice cream in like a very long
time, great, time to figure out how to get the fuck down up, you know what, are you serious,
that's so fucking stupid in it,
anyways,
you're telling me that that hurts me, that is the dumbest shit I've ever seen,
oh yeah, cry, cry, cry, I was about to say if I fucking die from this I'm gonna actually fight
um, Kaelin, wow, did not know I was here, um, oh fuck, oh I'm fine,
anyways,
what is rising behind me, skeleton boys,
alright, let me just run over this and there's one in here, oh these motherfuckers, yeah no,
we're not doing that today, oh hey, it's you, um, I'm sorry but I'm not interested into what you
have to sell, oh come on bro, I don't, I don't have time for this, just leave me, you fucking house
centipedes, I hate those, why are you so fast for no reason, are you good bro, oh fuck, I'm like
literally about to die, you get crushed like a bug, alright,
yeah why don't you hug him with your little doofy ass hats, um, you don't look too good,
she's probably fine right,
handing out ice cream in the chat, you have to save her, she's hot, I don't feel like doing her quest,
she's like breathing so heavily in my fucking ears,
um, alright, let's look for golden seeds,
okay, uh, frick, damn, there's so many, oh,
so long inflation,
for this fucking ad, I'll put you guys right next to the article,
long disease ASMR, okay, I'm in Kaleid right now, there's one in the B-seal sect, um,
heading to the B-seal sect, where the fuck is that, where's the, I mean,
map link,
oh I think I already grabbed that, yeah I did, okay,
there's one in the cellio town of sorcery under a phantom tree in the northern section of town,
okay, let's go talk to invisible people, we love to see you, yeah,
can you travel to that ship, no, that'd be cool if you could, I don't know, can you travel to
that ship, I don't know, I've never been able to, um, what is happening, what is, what is happening,
what's happening, what is happening to my stick, why isn't it moving,
the fuck, that was a weird ass glitch, anyways, um, I'm right next to the cellio town of sorcery,
it's like right over here, it's like, like up here, here, all right, let's go talk to these bitches,
damn it, oh I see it, oh there's a way for me to get down, nice,
nice, something behind me,
oh
comical typing,
oh thank god there's a grace right here,
I'm so close to death, no, I meant to sit down, Jesus Christ, don't you hate when just like balls
just like go to your face, just sucks, um, okay, this is the tree, it was like literally over there,
oh
are you shitting me right now, what do you have to say about this,
oh it's because I went the back way,
damn I have to go around,
I hear people creepily making noises on the other side, oh it's that,
oh, um, I'm fine,
yeah I'm fine,
nice, uh cool, I totally just,
cool, yeah, nice, cool,
what a beautiful town, really, look how, how gorgeous it is, it's so empty,
can't believe nobody lives in this gorgeous, beautiful town, I kind of want to drop down on this
thing, yeah,
yeah, uh, oh quick teleport,
I don't want to accidentally aggro people when I can't get out,
I got a bullet, I'm scared, I'm so sorry,
you live there, I'm so sorry that you do, um, okay, cool, we got that,
uh,
one can be, did I get that one near red main,
I mean I think I did, I think, did I,
I'm sorry, I wanted to do these ones, um, oh yeah, no I definitely talked to him,
um, so I definitely probably grabbed that one, question mark, let me just sit down,
I need three golden seeds,
uh, I think I already grabbed that one, am I winning, that's debatable,
there's also the pewter tree spirit, but I don't feel like doing that, um,
okay, let's go to limb grave, because I haven't, I haven't gone to limb grave,
I also haven't gone to fort height,
yeah, there's fort height, there's the starfall center, uh,
fort height is over here, it is,
it was really interesting, my first playthrough,
um, I had a weird glitch that live never spawned,
and I didn't do anything, like it's like I literally was like playing the game
as linearly as it can get, and you could hear Blythe like howl and shit or whatever the
fuck noise he makes, but then I never saw him, he never, and he's like, you know he's like at
the top of that thing or whatever, I had to restart my game so I could talk to him,
I didn't, well I just made another game, I just, because I was just like, what the fuck, it was
really weird, uh, yeah the whistle never worked, yeah because you have to get the whistle so he
shows up, yeah it never worked, he just glitched and never showed, hi, I don't feel like talking to you,
um, not that I have any money to buy shit,
hey, how's it going,
how's it going everyone, I don't mind if I grab that real quick, oh I gotta go,
it's been cool, nice seeing you all, it's been a really long time,
glad to see you guys are all in good spirits, love that for you,
yeah, oh yeah there's just a thingy, um, I still, okay I'm not, uh, where is the other one,
yeah I was really annoying,
let me find the sleeping peninsula,
fuck, did I get that one, I can't recall,
I don't think I did, again I've literally just been bouncing around places so I probably haven't
gone to places, oh, okay maybe I did, we'll just see,
so literally like right here, let's see if I
got that one because I can't recall if I did,
isn't there like a giant here,
yeah, there it is, I don't think I grabbed it because of the giant,
um, yeah there it is,
I think I was more distracted by the giant, yep,
let her go towards, good job, make it down, thank you,
that's a close one, yikes, um, so aggro, I can't get out of here,
yippee, let me just get rid of that marker, I can't get rid of the marker, let's just float,
run at the marker,
whoa, we're gonna kill this giant,
get him, hurry before he shoots the ground,
yeah,
ow,
yeah, what, I thought I jumped, I'm just not jumping, at least you're not doing that much
damage to me, that's cool, um, thanks, I'm sure you can have your bow, that'd be nice, arm,
arm, what's up here again, how are we gonna,
aw, thank you,
your sheepee tax, that's cute, thank you, thank you for the tip,
um, when you guys are useless, just start paying me money, that's sad,
okay, I got that, wait, why don't I, I just forget to do things,
tutorial island, that's a good way of putting it,
cool, nice, okay, so we got the riot,
um,
if I kill Kenneth height, I can get one,
I didn't know I could kill Kenneth height for a fucking thing,
so,
if you kill him, he gives you a golden seed,
Kenneth did nothing wrong, you can max it out without killing him, I never knew that,
because I completed his quest before, and I know I could kill him, I just would have,
learning of the gains,
damn, there's one in the carry a manor, I do love carry a manor, it's one of my favorite levels
to clear, there's one in oxtella, there's one in sofra, lindel, yeah, two can be found
underneath the phantom tree inside the western gate, capillel skirts,
he's gonna steal her to stormville castle when you steal her elven line,
I think completing this quest along with the water, yeah, nepheli, whatever,
you max upgrade, yeah, I did that before, okay, there's really nothing else I could grab
without having to defeat bosses, because there's also a tree spirit in the pharynx roll
heroes grave, and I do have the key to get into that, and there's also the putrid spirit boss
at the end of the war dead catacombs, so that would be two, but that's not really my goal right
now, my goal is just because I would rather be leveled so I can just fuck everybody up
and then get those later, so now
I'm thinking we go get that mimic tear, I think, I think it's time
the base talisman, what's the base talisman,
I did clear the pharynx roll heroes grave, I just don't remember the name of shit,
I just don't remember the name of shit,
where's the lady with the fingers, where's the finger lady, I'm gonna finger her so fucking hard,
what does the earth treats favor do, I forget, hey
you think I'm cute, you have some interesting toes
I hate them so much, they're so fucking gross okay,
just some random eldritch, they're not even like part of something,
they're not like part of a big hand, or they are part of a big hand, and the hand talks to her,
and it's because of the outer lords, where's your head, oh yeah I don't care,
thank you,
big preach, big preach, uh
what am I doing, you have incantations but I'm not doing that,
oh the all knowing, the all glowing, I'm gonna destroy your entire fucking area,
oh you can't destroy as much as you could, I remember you could destroy literally everything in
this room, and now you can't, where is he, where the fuck is this bitch, and what do I have to do,
I'm hoping it isn't mine, I did some redecorating,
this looks pretty good,
yeah I remember before you could like fucking destroy this table, I mean destroying literature,
I thought the emissary of the greater well are two fingers sitting in a room, yeah I just,
honestly George R. R. Martin, and was it Miyazaki, yeah I'm fucking stupid, they're interesting,
did I, I already unlocked the dung eater,
hey
I never finished your quest, you're fucking weird though, you just like
fucking desecrate people's corpses, um
no, here you go,
oh nifty, nice bell bearing bitch,
this bitch is just festering bloody finger,
because it's like night armor, night helm,
they don't, let me buy that,
I'm like guano goblin, caca consumer,
ever felt the curse, no,
like kindly let me go talk to the lady so I can get
this dude's bow,
again I always get turned around to this place, these ugly ass fingers, why is it two weird fingers,
I don't, who's supposed to sit here, that's not you,
I would like to receive equipment of champions, I don't have enough money,
sorry, I need to receive power,
thank you, big preach,
I thought she was gonna tell me to go fuck myself,
see uh, I have a good time at work, I'll see you in eight hours,
I should do anything with those games, I could tell what's happening, don't worry about it,
the two fingers and three fingers make a hand, why, I don't know,
yeah because Ronnie likes the three fingers, they like the two fingers and they together make a hand,
because you got like the thumb is supposed to definitely be over here and then you,
I feel like this is, yeah the thumb's supposed to be over here, then the ring and the pinky finger
and then those are the three fingers, they're so gross, I hate them so much, um Ronnie likes the three fingers,
wait I forget, who likes the three fingers, yeah Ronnie doesn't want any, she's like I
fucking hate the greater will, I need to watch like another one of those lore videos with the
update stuff with the DLC, hey it's you, I used to think this guy was cute, why, I don't know
because you can't even see his fucking face, um yeah it's D, I just think of the fucking memes from
look up, just look up uh Game Grumps playing Elden Ring and they do the funniest fucking
little bit for D and it's hilarious, they already killed the Mariners,

where's the fourth somber stone,
oh wait I can just, yeah I can just go to EG, that's right, all right I'll just do that,
I don't fucking feel like looking for shit, looks like he's like pounding my ass,

but then I just choke the next 50 times, I don't know why that is, but it's a thing,
this happens to me, I think because I overthink it, it's the chibi syndrome,

How could you do this?
Oh my god, it's gone, you destroyed it, I fixed it, it's fine.
I can't believe you've done this, you guys really wanted to read what you were saying.
Don't forget, everything when I play video games is your fault.

I know I parkour too hard, I don't even need to be here,
how the fuck do I get out,
fuck, I have to continue to leave, yeah I just wanted to mimic here,
what the fuck was that, I just did a weird drop roll in there,
all right, yeah let's just, let's just, let's head over to the artist shack,
all right,
we made it,
yeah mandatory if you summon mimic you didn't beat the game, that's so stupid,
yeah I should probably get a lantern,
where are the lanterns, can I, I can buy it from uh, what's this face, can I,
oh that's not what I wanted,
what the fuck am I doing,
it's a merchant in South Eler Eurnia, it's not, I thought Ella had it,
I mean, what the fuck this dude's name is,
no, oh he has a torch, that's what he has,
I can use a telescope,
get a cool chain quaff,
for now,
uh, South Eurnia,
if you use any other weapon than dagger or use any armor you cheat,
it's the isolated merchant, I thought you said it was Eurnia,
because is it the dude over here, no, is it the dude over here, where,
where do I go,
bottom left island, over here,
in the, where the dragon shit is,
that left shirt, what,
left side, oh so over here,
you guys are giving me multiple things, you're giving me Eler Eurnia and you're giving me
even peninsula,
I'll have to start calling on you and be like you there, you tell me where to go,
because everybody else is, then I'll give it to somebody else another turn,
hello,
I remember trying to fight this like one dude forever on the beach,
I don't know who it was,
all the beach south, I'm going north,
other direction, I did it,
maybe I like to do things the hard way,
look at these guys, they're just, they're just hanging out,
they're just doing guy things, they're literally just like,
why are there so many of them by the beach, I always wondered that,
is this just so you could practice like giant crowd spells or attacks,
maybe, I don't know, it's a casual beach party,
let's go to the beach,
beach, Ninky Minjaj,
oh hey, isn't this what the shrimp guy is, the prawn guy, the shrimp prawn guy too,
bye, you have a nice outfit,
do you cover your face completely,
at the end of the day, I would like to buy one lantern,
one moment, just give me a second, I swear I have money,
I'm sorry my card's not working,
it's gonna work in just a second, I swear to god,
give me, give me a moment,
I should have done that one, I should have done that one,
2,500, how much was it,
what was it, I think it was 1,800, I already forgot,
we're gonna, we'll leave him a tip, you know, we'll leave him,
fuck, we'll leave him a tip, sorry, I'm trying to talk to you,
yeah, sorry I'm like making you look over your shoulder,
what,
those ashes of, oh, the Zwei Handar, colossal sword,
sacrificial twig, what you guys are except it's sacrificial twink,
yeah, you know, you got your lantern, I should probably put that to someplace else,
2,000, magnificent weapon,
all right, so we got the Mimic Tear,
I don't have a lot of glove wart, I think I only have like,
why, I hate that sometimes I like to mark it, life is robots,
is Roderica doing shit now, no, she's just being weird, can you like,
oh, sorry, we have to talk to fucking Master Hugue, damn it, I'm going the wrong way,
Hugue, Hugue, balls, I'm going the wrong way, I told you guys, I just get lost,
Hugue, that's the two fingers, you spin me right around,
baby right around, Hugue, what's in here, oh it's Fia, Fia, hi Fia,
hi,
here's the homie, here's question line next for Nagakiba and the
anti-mogue bullshit crystal, yes, you're right, I want to hug Fia but she debuffs me,
I forget, how do you get, doesn't she give you something to get rid of the debuff,
I forget, the blessing, okay,
I sort of way,
Fia, oh, the lovely hug,
I'm in a cold suit of armor but thank you,
what is a bald again,
you take me in your pants,
no, I didn't want to go, why is everybody so weirdly fucking proportioned,
besides our own character, our heads are so small,
oh,
call me dear, yeah, yeah, yeah,
you're on the top,
my second never wants to repeat the fraction I was going over here,
oh, I'm not dead, Rodriguez,
I love their like friendship, like his fatherly affection for her, it's very sweet,
Why do you have chains on your legs?
It's like, why are you so ugly?
You know, just ask people why they have chains on their legs and why they're ugly.
I'm going to kill this guy, because I feel like it.
Oh, I got a new member.
Welcome. Welcome to the harem.
Are there any details to pay attention to the forces of our life at this time?
You guys are the real one.
Oh, nice.
I got one of those.
Isn't that like late game? I forget.
Ugh, weird.
I got that boom boom pow.
Oh, we're both going to kill each other?
Yeah.
Stop.
Don't heal again, you motherfucker.
I have frostbite.
Stop it.
No, you don't get to kill me.
No.
What?
I threw my controller across the room. I don't know if you guys hear it, heard it.
No, I think it kind of just like rolled over my couch to be honest with you, then plopped on the ground.
Looks like we have a new throne entry.
No, I need to add, what's it called?
Am I throne? I usually get new joy cons because I have six drifts.
I'm going to go grab my controller.
Thank you.
Oh, are you taking care of this one?
Okay, a little ruffle of your process.
Alright, where'd it go?
Oh, over here.
Hi, Raina.
Are you like, ended up in your general direction?
I'm going to get on the stretch.
Yeah.
You want to stretch me?
You want to stretch me?
Yeah, all of you.
You didn't do the stretching, did you?
Oh, you can see it.
Hi, Raina.
I know you're here. I just saw you, Raina.
I thought you were being fake.
Here, you're looking a little bit chunky.
What's that, Raina?
Why do you look so large?
Here, why do you look a little funny?
It's because we're done.
Come here.
You look like you're taking over this world.
It was raised alongside dogs,
but under a rescuer,
and sometimes she curls her tail over her back.
I mean...
Yeah, can you do a big stretch?
Yeah, a lot of big stretch.
Yeah?
Raina, stretch!
She did it.
She got up on her tippy toes and stretched her up real long.
You guys missed it.
Sorry.
Why do I have in my box of Korean food?
Fuck away from here.
No, is this a shiho right?
I'm fine.
What's in here?
I got...
They're all just like pastry things.
Victory pie.
Ooh, a victory pie.
I should eat a victory pie.
I'll eat this victory pie.
The vic pie.
That's a weird-looking thing on it.
After I beat the fucking mad tone,
al-bar-la-la-la-la.
I'm about to go mono-e-mono.
My headphones are off.
I need to plug in my controller again.
Oh, my God.
She said, call that dolphin kitty.
My cat used to do that. That's cute.
If you're confident, you can get replacement choices
whether they be cheap or expensive.
You don't know what you're doing.
What?
Placement joysticks?
You want me to take apart my controller?
You want me to take apart my Joy-Con?
I'm smart, but I'm not that smart.
See, it works fine.
My PlayStation controller works fine.
I'll break. I come to bargain.
I'll take this, though.
You don't get to stun-lock me, dude.
No.
What the fuck?
What the hell?
I want a scythe.
Where do I get this fucking scythe?
Oh, my God. He's going to kill me again.
I got frostbite.
Why don't you fucking heal?
Yeah.
Why don't you fucking heal?
Motherfucker.
Yeah, you don't have any more, bitch.
Oh, shit.
Oh, fuck. Oh, shit.
But I have more.
Because I'm that bitch.
Anyways.
Is that the meta in the PvP?
I never ever play PvP.
Is that the meta?
Did this be a door?
I don't know. You tell me.
Stole his tongue.
Mmm.
Time for this victory pie.
It looks really gross.
Ew.
It smells bad.
Is it supposed to be strawberry flavored?
It has a giant V on it.
For Veeler.
It's a calming bad tongue as well.
I found madness to break PvP,
at least when I'm getting invaded.
Oh, nice.
Mmm.
It doesn't taste good.
Oh, thanks.
I'm good. Oh, thank you.
Damn.
You write a whole fucking essay
on the four agreements, bro?
Jesus Christ.
I just had to read it.
That's okay. I don't need this.
I like Stormville.
I mean Stormville. I like Moonville.
Sexy.
I am sexy.
I am sexy.
What are you doing?
Okay, is there a better snack in here
that is actually tasty?
Is this coffee?
Or coffee flavored?
It's like a wafer.
I can't get it out.
Oh.
It is coffee flavored.
It's actually not bad.
Interesting.
Kind of tweaking my mind out,
because I feel like I'm drinking coffee,
but I'm eating a biscuit.
Brother writing a thesis.
I usually don't like coffee flavored things.
I just prefer to drink coffee.
Lever or lever? Why?
I haven't had tiramisu in a long time.
Espresso mixed into chocolate
goes pretty hard.
I thought it was a party hard.
Too bad the place I bought the front was down.
Oh, that's too bad.
Look at all these
overgrown swords.
Pickle?
Aren't the flower up there?
Read message.
I want to roll into the fire.
Let's me roll into the fire.
What am I doing next?
I'm sorry.
I immediately turned when I saw it.
It was kind of funny.
I'm getting
the
Mogue tier.
Where's the Mogue tier?
I'm going to go over here and I'm going to grab that.
I'm going to go to the Ertree Gazing Hill.
What is this?
I'm literally just taking a bite of things
and then throwing it away.
Why is everything like a fig Newton?
What is supposed to be in the middle of this?
Why is it spicy?
Am I allergic?
I don't think I like that.
I'm covered in crumbs.
No, I think I'll be good.
Oh, shit. Why did I not see this before?
Hello?
Why did I not grab that?
I think I have enough to level up.
No.
No, I don't.
No.
I know there's some in the center.
Exactly, Boomi.
Oh, am I allergic?
No.
Hi.
Are you headbutting the box?
What's up?
Did you want it?
I was going to headbutt me.
You chewed this box, by the way.
Oh, my main main.
Oh, such a big head.
Yeah.
What are you chewing on the box?
He's a dog.
Puppy?
You're a little puppy?
You're a little puppy dog?
Boomi, are you teasing?
Baby?
I actually still have Boomi's first baby tooth,
just like a mom.
I regret where I put it, though.
Is that it?
No.
Welcome.
Day two of stream watching.
Welcome, welcome.
So,
let me go grab this.
Here.
That's all the way over there.
At least I can see where the fuck I'm going.
I can also
kill some fire monks
so I can be
more resistant
to fire magic myself.
I might do that
when I find some of my farm some fire monks.
Monks? Monks?
Why am I saying monks?
What the fuck is wrong with me?
I don't have my headphones in,
so I can't tell if anything's attacking me or not.
I'm not sure if the music's just changed.
I should probably put my thumb in.
Missed the Furpy App hour because you were asleep?
No worries.
We still yapping, we still having a good time.
I was eating soup.
You missed the soup, bro.
Let's get rid of Radon's Rune or keep the Godric one.
I forget what Radon's Rune does.
I didn't even go to the tower for his Rune.
So,
let me see.
Yeah, see, I can't.
I haven't gotten it benedicted yet.
It's best for a late game.
Increases health, fp, and endurance by 10%.
I hate that.
It isn't just a standard status.
You have to pop it, the Rune, to use it.
I'll be honest with you,
when I beat the game, I never even used great runes.
I never factored those into my builds.
I'm going the wrong way.
Excuse me.
I don't mind you guys educating me on great runes.
Where is it?
It's over here.
I was some time.
It was very rarely.
It was a random thing rolling down the way.
Let's get it honestly same bro I already grabbed the one over here oh no I didn't

i need to take something from my head hi toma
oh
all right
are you speaking of me
heard that that was his name
bring another snappy
one
well i see it's supposed to
Are you alive? Okay. Just check me. Just check me. Hi. Oh, did you hear that?
Go show me the work. I don't know.
Let's see.
I'll call a bit and I can change this.
Oh, wait. This isn't for you. Go away.
I'll call a bit and I can change this.
I'll call a bit and I can change this.
Stop. No. Don't be. Why are you trying to take me so much today?
Turn around and move easy. You might not be able to see me. Let's put it in the microwave.
Don't start jumping in the microwave.
Boomi is here.
Well, he wants to pull him out of Boomi. First, she be steals Boomi chicken noodles soup.
Now, his mac and cheese.
Oh, he does. He climbs in the cabinets. He climbs in the fridge. He climbs in my washing machine.
He tries to get into the dryer, but it's stacked on top of the washing machine so you can't get to it.
He tries to get into the microwave. I think he's talking to the microwave once.
He's got a dishwasher where I was loading it up and I walked away for a moment.
He literally has, I have to double check that he's not somewhere so I don't accidentally fucking kill him.
I'm just going to feed up. I have a little next-level thing that you can feed it up and it has essential oils and stuff.
So it's kind of like a relaxive... relaxive.
I'm going to put a little bit of barbecue sauce on my mac and cheese and a little barbecue sauce.
And you know, thankfully I have barbecue sauce because I only accommodate it to my home.
It's Chick-fil-A barbecue sauce.
I'm going to put a little balsamic on it, you know, a little bit of balsamic.
Oh, delicious.
He's talking me into buying groceries.
Mmm, girl dinner. It's just what? It's just mac and cheese and a little bit of barbecue sauce on my phone.
Very tasty.
He's trying to bake it in the bottom.
Oh, my God.
My diet is condiments? No.
It's very sacred to have girl dinner. Very sacred.
It's very good girl dinner.
You need real food that's not DoorDash? Yeah, so...
I'm not sure if it's a Bible study.
Girl dinner is essential.
Yeah, Toma gets it.
Toma has amazing girl dinners, so like she'll post her for girl dinners of the day for girl breakfast.
Precisely. I'll be able to get some home cooked meals.
It's funny because like I can cook, like I'm a good cook and all I just don't have any rest like materials to cook with.
Oopsies.
Oh, hey, my audio comes out today.
Where do I get Azur's comment?
My eye itches.
I'll have to do Selen's quest. Is it worth it?
Because I feel like, because that doesn't like stomach him. That'll be a while.
No? Okay.
What are your suggestions? Do you think I should really just like aim just to do bleed?
Because I remember last time I beat Mogue, I literally, I just summoned somebody and they literally just whipped out Azur's comment and just fucking mowed him down.
And I was like, oh, thanks, Rando. Because again, yeah, he's very slow.
Yeah, give me, give me some just because I still have one slot.
I have a slot, a memory slot. I'm cracking it back.
Ah, there it is. Ah, there it is again.
That's if you're overleveled from him.
No, I try to like be bosses by myself in the night. If I can't do it, then I'll summon you guys.
There's no suit with dead. I just teared and commented him too, but you need to be quite leveled. Okay.
Nice crack. I'll look at my butt. I'm kidding. I'm looking at my boobs. I'm kidding.
I'm getting a really bad pain in my lower back. I feel like I need to like stand up.
I'm going to put my pants down so I can lift this heat on my back. Oh, that feels so good.
Ah, my back hurts too.
Sorry, again, I'm a 52 year old woman. Sorry, 56 year old woman.
So it's very hard to live.
I'm getting dialysis on my ass.
Sorry.
And the breasts are out of strength on the screen. How's that?
Good. Torture y'all.
Tell me, did you just steal her spring? Are you bringing it to me? Do you want me to throw it? Okay, drop it.
Oh, thank you.
Ready?
We're getting it.
Brother, did you get it? Okay, bring it back. Bring it back.
Nope, bring it back. Boomie.
You dropped it too far. Don't look at me. I'm not grabbing it.
He's like looking at me like, why don't you come and pick it up and throw it again, please?
Yeah, don't knock it under the closet door.
This feels nice on my back.
This is only 26.
I know it requires a lot, but we're literally about to start farming.
I'm probably going to go get some arrows so I can farm that bird.
A question, though. Did they patch the farm where you're still where Mogwin's Castle is?
And you kind of like go through these rocks and you go through this cave and then you jump down and then you just swing and dagger back and forth and then you just farm?
Did they patch that? Did you just fall through the map?
Did the bird farm still work? Okay.
I remember doing that, you know, farm for a bit because you got more, I believe, in the bird farm.
All right.
Oh, Toma just went live.
What is it called? She goes off?
There it is, also, live because it's age.
Toma, I know where it is.
I need a heart.
You!
Yeah, I think I'll go through these.
Yeah, I think I'll go through these.
Yeah, I think I'll go through these.
Yeah, I think I'll go through these.
Yeah, I think I'll go through these.
Yeah, I think I'll go through these.
Yeah, I think I'll go through these.
Yeah, I think I'll go through these.
Okay, hi. Sorry.
I got distracted because I don't know what to do with you.
It's funny.
I don't know if you're okay with me bringing it back, but I'm just sitting here.
I really wish I had ice cream.
Did I already talk about ice cream today? Do I now want ice cream?
I'm not going to be my appetite screen back all the time.
How are you guys doing? Are you guys okay?
He's falling asleep from the dead silence and then he's like, hey guys.
You get an EP?
You could have gotten an ice cream when you buy groceries.
I'm a bit EP too.
I can't believe I've been streaming for almost eight hours.
Oh.
Look, there's also makeup.
Okay.
You don't need it.
Okay.
Okay, okay.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
Sorry, am I leaving?
I've been sitting down for a real long time.
Hello.
Being back.
Super EP.
12.15. Time for sleep.
Oh, thank you. Thank you. Good night everybody that's going to sleep.
Good night.
Sleep tight.
Don't let the madam bite.
Because I will and he'll be very, very hard.
I'm working while the stream is on.
I don't know why this is so scary.
Proof.
Proof.
Proof.
Proof.
Proof.
Proof.
Proof.
Proof.
Watch that voice. This is top scare.
Pro controversial madam.
Bye everybody. Have a good night.
Thank you for stopping by.
If you guys got stuff to do, make sure you go do it.
If you have chores to do, make sure you.
public. Did your, did your peepee jump? Did your bible jump up in joy? Sorry, that's
my, um, hair leaning back in it. Giving yourself the ol' hawk to look? My house? Nice, nice.
8-18 for me. Good for another 4-6 hours. Uh, no, I'm gonna just keep playing.
Talk to my brother like that. Man, like, leg needs to pop and I can't pop it.
Okay, pop it.
Selling your torch yesterday or should I be a mistake? Did I miss your left or dead club?
That was good. That was a really fun collab.
Make sure you watch the void.
I say my bible says so, do you say that? Hee hee hee. Hee hee hee, hoo hoo hoo.
Alright, where am I?
Look, I'm at my pillow, at my blinky.
Let me fix my model. I haven't looked at OBS this entire time, so I, I apologize if my
model's like, far the fuck away.
Okay, um, let me grab that. Let me do that.
Lean back.
Make myself a little bit bigger.
I'm close. By my clouds.
Should we talk for over 4 hours after? Yeah, I know, it's not the same.
Danielson says, I know, they fucking took out Azura, like, what the hell?
Yeah, I was, I was surprised I kept talking, because I literally was gonna end stream right after
the collab and like, go like, fuck about or whatever. And then, um, what was it?
Then Azura's like, oh, I think I might talk to my chat and like say bye and everything.
I'm like, oh, actually, I should do that too.
And talk to you guys about, like, that I'll be leaving for a little bit.
Um, and then I just talk for 4 hours.
Lipsies.
Oopsie-doopsies.
Aw, I hope you feel better.
I'm sorry I'm in pain too.
I almost paid, I know, you guys almost got me to talk another 30 minutes.
It's not happening again, I still want to watch a boys episode.
Oh la la la la la.
How long have I been streaming for?
Let's see.
I just feel like it's been more than 8 hours.
Um, goes by, would you have a phone?
Oh wait, now I can see the chat.
I do love the app streams.
I love the app in two guys.
Instructions.
You have that effect.
Ow, my knee.
Uh, I just hit my knee.
The app love.
Live, live the app love.
That was a beautiful shot you guys were able to see.
Just people just like hanging out, you know, just chilling.
I always love the compare, like the similarities between this and like Christ on the cross.
And then it's like Merica, because Merica is like Christ essentially and God.
It's very interesting to me, the parallels, the biblical stuff in this game.
What's my runes?
What the hell?
Can I pick them up please? Jesus Christ.
What am I doing now?
Cool.
Oh yeah, I'm going to West of Gaitown.
Over here, isn't it?
I don't know why I closed it out.
I kind of felt Christian fiction is a Jesus thing and not just a cruel way to kill people invented by the Romans.
Well it was, like if Jesus was the only one that was crucified, they would do that to just normal people.
It's really funny because it's like, I think they discovered they never put them on crosses,
but it was just like a giant stake in the ground where you're pinned up above your head and below your legs.
The south of the marker?
Below this?
I think you're right.
Yeah, the random dude who's just like, I'm hanging out.
He's just like, ah, you'll be with me in heaven in paradise.
Although, again, different translations.
Sorry, excuse me.
Oh yes, the temple fortah.
Yeah, that's a lot.
Oh, fuck that I got all over here.
I need to get a better vantage point.
Alright.
Let's go.
Damn, that horse can jump.
Yeah, I remember I grew up reading the King James version of the Bible.
You want to go to the next island to the south on the map?
Over there?
That one?
That's not the south, is it?
That's the west.
Over there?
I think that's it straight ahead.
Yeah.
Okay.
Let me go get my fucking...
That was weird, where are they?
Thank you.
That was odd.
Oh, no ice.
I died there, but you know, go off, sis, I suppose.
I guess I won't go down that particular way, because it just killed me.
So just step out right here and land properly.
Right here, and land properly.
Sorry if you can hear Fiamme yelling to herself in the background, she's playing.
Bari, where the fuck are you, bro?
There you are.
You are...
You look like a woman.
You look like a very comely woman.
What's up with that?
Thank you.
Did I sneeze again?
I don't remember.
They didn't seem right.
They look gross and sickly.
We come through the maid in himself.
Why are you covered in blood?
Why are you covered in blood?
Fari's the baddest.
Baddest of them all.
Ooh, you wanna dance, baby?
Oh.
It's had a really bad burp.
I wonder what happens if, like, you say, I think they're awesome.
Wow.
All right.
I don't really feel like I'm meeting a random person.
Um...
I forget how do you do this without...
I rather do the P-W-E. I'm online, so if I go...
Okay.
I don't know why I'm here.
Ah, I'm stuck.
I don't know why I clicked that.
I just saw an accept button, and I wanted to click it.
Um...
Okay.
I don't know why I clicked that.
I just saw an accept button, and I wanted to click it.
Um...
Yeah, don't you have to be in offline mode?
Uh, let's do it.
Oh, I didn't mean to fucking press that.
It's fine.
What?
What?
I'm offline.
What?
Is it working?
I forgot to inform you we're still alive.
Shit.
What do you mean?
First Mount Gelmer Bridge Grace?
What do you mean?
Press any button.
Continue.
You don't have to be offline, though.
I've beaten it offline.
Because you just fight the random NPCs.
The fuck off.
I was running in the wrong direction.
Hi!
What?
But I've done it without invading someone before.
Why isn't it letting me do it?
There's an NPC I could just kill in the white blood ruins.
That's an...
You said the Altus Watto?
Okay.
White blood ruins.
My eyes fucking twitching.
Quick! Google search!
It's writhed blood, by the way.
It's not white blood.
Why are they so small?
Better do it than she being Google.
Me and you.
Who made you do this?
You're spreading under the couch.
I think you just did.
I think you just did.
Ooh, what this blood grease?
Spring or cry?
I literally just got them four springs
from out from under my...
They? Fire monks?
No.
Out from under...
my fridge, so...
Alright.
Where are you at?
Fucking dogs.
Oh, what's this?
Oh, my God.
Oh, I'm s- I have them in the wrong thing.
Oh, no.
Hold on.
I forgot I had them in the wrong...
May what?
Oh, no. What the fuck?
I was confused.
Should be an invasion sign?
Oh, okay.
I thought I did this all before.
I just don't fucking remember shit.
Hmm.
What are you eating in that one?
Fucking dogs!
Oh, you fucking puppy!
Flashes.
Actually, I'm gonna kill these fucking dogs
before I do anything.
Oh, what the hell?
I'm gonna kill them all
because it did the little indication that I did.
Anyone else?
Anyone else?
Alright.
I should fold this guy.
He is running at me.
Jesus.
Yeah, I fucking understand.
Oh, God.
Jesus, stop using beast magic on me.
Oh, I didn't mean to hit that.
Oh, let's not die.
Oh, I forgot you only have limited shit.
I totally forgot about that.
I totally forgot about this thing.
I totally forgot about this thing.
Sorry, bro.
You can revert the eyes
in the mirror in the wrong table.
What?
The other, the bloody finger quest
gives you character weird eyes.
Oh!
You've ruined your fashion souls, Bill.
That's funny.
I forgot.
Yeah, they get like, I left them
because I thought they looked cool.
Shibu Pro Gamer?
I don't know about that.
Yeah, it makes your eyes fucking weird looking.
I liked it, though, because my character had
really pale gray skin and platinum white hair.
So it was cool.
Yeah, I'm happy I killed them
because then they can't just fucking attack me
when I'm standing here.
It makes you a star.
So, yeah, I like the frenzy frame.
It makes your eyes like crazy gold,
orangey shit, and I always like that.
Who was talking?
I don't know.
I hear someone like deeply breathing.
What the fuck is that?
What the fuck is that?
Become a witcher.
The ucky burn marks aren't a good point.
Sorry, I'll stop breathing.
What is your name?
Oh, you have a dog nearby?
I don't think that's what dogs sound like.
It sounds like there's a troll below me
laughing.
Oh, it is like dogs.
What the fuck are those?
Oh, it's like the Blight dogs.
That's terrifying.
I'm like, what the hell is that noise?
The worm face, bros.
Alright, where's the next one?
Point me in the right direction.
I'll fuck him up.
I'll fuck him up.
I'll fuck him up.
I'll blow him up.
Uh oh.
It's like that slog that goes
really like 10 miles an hour
or whatever the heck
towards your location.
But you never know when it's coming
and it's just one of those fucking things.
They might want the Patreon link.
Patreon link is in the description below, guys.
Oh, check out my new audio. It's coming out tonight.
I'll figure out which one it is.
Wait, hold on. I'll tell you right now.
The inevitable snail, precisely.
I don't know.
I don't know, because like it
management puts it up or like
strongly schedules it, so I don't
know exactly.
Put her down?
Okay, it's supposed to start loading right now.
I thought it was suspended for a second.
I was like, yay.
Oh.
Okay.
There is a schedule.
Okay.
What day is it?
What weekend is it?
GFTSU, their impressive milk collection.
GFTSU is actually into
awesome female superiors,
but it sounds like that makes me feel good.
I'm strawing the techie behind the girls.
Uh, yeah.
Sure.
Wait, guys.
Where's the next one?
I feel like I'm just replaying the game at a faster speed.
Except I'm not
faster.
Am I done?
I have to go top bar, right?
I thought I had to kill more than one.
I thought I had to kill three.
It gave me away those fucking worm things.
He just really wanted me to kill that one guy.
I thought I had to kill that one guy.
I thought I had to get some bloody maiden shit.
I have to go back to
that church
and then dip it in the maiden's blood, probably.
Where am I going?
Okay, wrong way.
That's where I'm going.
I don't have
any sense of
direction.
That's the next step? Okay.
Blood lady.
You're fun to watch. Good luck in the DLC.
Aw, thank you. Appreciate it.
I'm just a goofy little goobah.
Oh, it's your first super on a live stream.
I popped you a super cherry.
Thank you. Thank you.
Hey, Leos.
Hellos. Hellos.
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hello.
Vore.
Vore.
I have to speak with you. There's a weird guy.
Hi.
Is this the guy I gotta come get me?
It's so nice. Thank you.
I wonder what he looks like
without his mask on.
Why are you rubbing your hands together like that?
Aw, thank you.
Yeah, I'm totally not going to kill your god.
Dynasty.
Because he likes Micola.
He likes little...
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Who would have a...
I mean, I can't say that.
I thought I'd get...
How'd I get the...
Okay.
Ermm.
Yeah, it broke a long time ago.
I don't know why he's breaking lately.
Oh, it broke.
Damn, it does not want to work.
Usually, I can just refresh the...
source.
Does my stream die?
I think I'm fine, aren't I?
Did my stream die?
I think I'm fine, aren't I?
Yeah, this is where I just want to work.
Oh, there we go.
Back here.
Yeah.
I'm trying to fix it.
Yeah, this looks gross.
I have to make it look like it was before.
Because I always have to generate a link.
I'll put it in Comic Sans.
Okay, looks a little bit wonky.
It's funny, because it works.
It sounds like I'm talking into a fan.
Why does it sound like I'm talking into a fan?
What the fuck?
It's still not working.
It does not want to work.
Okay.
It's like very delayed.
Okay.
That's so weird.
I wonder why it's doing that.
And even if there was a fan,
y'all spilling eyelash,
why is the microphone...
Did it actually bump my...
weird?
Oh, it was when I was really distant.
Oh, it was because I was
when I lay down here.
Yeah.
I sound fine.
Oh, that's nice.
Why did nobody tell me
that since I played the video
to find where something was
needed?
Why didn't anybody tell me
that I didn't turn my desktop audio
back on?
What's wrong with you?
Because I may be.
I was scared.
Oh.
Because my voice is cute.
You could hear Vari, though?
What?
What the fuck is going on in my game sound, then?
Because it was literally
I had like...
I had set it as off.
That's weird.
Why did I still have audio then?
Oh, maybe it was like...
I don't know. I give up.
I don't care that much.
It's a show that was muted for me
on OBS.
Okay.
I don't think I'm going to be able to make chat work.
Okay.
Oh.
Now it works.
I don't know why that works,
although I just kept refreshing it
over and over and over again.
My first jinx.
My toes are cold. Come suck on them.
He doesn't know that I have a maiden.
Alright, let's go to...
Where was it?
Er...
Backstreet's back.
Alright.
Can I just fucking...
Do you want to get from Missle?
Missle? Where was that?
It was in Caled, wasn't it?
That was near the Frenzy Village.
Wasn't that up here?
I'm like, where was it?
Was it the Second Church of America?
Was it the Ernie?
Oh yeah, you're right.
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
The Church of inhibition?
I kind of remember...
I always... I always...
I keep confusing the Church of inhibition
where the church is, where the turtle is at.
That's why.
I don't know why I keep thinking the turtle is here.
Thank you.
It is...
I wish my eye would stop twitching.
Thanks for watching.
I hope you enjoyed it.
Okay.
I'm going to...
I'm going to...
I'm going to...
I'm going to...
I'm going to...
I'm going to...
I'm going to...
I'm surprised I accidentally ran into the little pillar that has what's-her-face on it.
It was like, I'm secretly a salamander person thing area, which is another name I almost
called Fia, but I'm like, I don't... I didn't like her that much. What's happening here?
That guy doesn't have a head. Oh, what? What's happening? Oh, stop it. I don't like that I
can get aggroed right over here. That was just really funny. I just, I always wanted to see if there
was a pillow. I need another pillow. Put my arm on. I'm bothered. I didn't even know
there's a fucking stake America here. Uh, yoink. Okay, do I have enough to level up? I need 16.
Oh, I can get 16. I can get 16. I wish I selected two, but it's fine. Oh, damn it. I didn't mean to talk to you.
Luminary Moog!
Are you gonna cut off my finger when I do something for this?
Sorry, hold on a moment.
This looks so funny because he's not really doing anything.
Luminary Moog! Off her finger.
I thought he was gonna say cream. I always be like, yeah, you know, I got some sweet cream.
If you do, I do say so myself. Let me go to here for a second.
This is a little nasty.
All right.
What am I doing? Oh, it's my cat's food.
Are you kidding me? I need like 50 runes.
It's freedom time. I'm gonna turn the lights like a fuck suit.
All he has in question, when he's coming out from somewhere, he was like, oh, and then
Raina's still napping. Raina, go eat.
Do you accept cat food by any chance?
Did he not give me the badge yet? What do you mean the badge?
Yeah.
I mean the badge.
Oh, yeah, you're right.
Maybe I need to talk to him again. Maybe I didn't exhaust my...
That's right. It's the badge. I don't know why I thought it was the bloody finger.
I probably didn't exhaust the dialogue.
All right. I don't have a badge.
Wow.
Oh, that's so crazy. Wow. Wow. Wow.
He's in front of me. You must wait. I'm there. All right. Let's see if I can remember.
Let's see if I can remember how to get there.
It's because I had been sitting there for hours and hours.
Pardon me. You guys look like you're doing well. Really nice. So happy for you. Oh, thank you.
Sorry. Pardon me.
He has a slug.
I don't know what you guys are worshipping, but good for you.
That was a big boy.
Existing. You're just on the walking tip.
That's there.
I never get what's down here. Oh, yeah, that's right. More sanguine dudes.
Oh, hey. What are you doing up here? No.
Who will what this?
No.
Fucking hell. Oh, no.
Yeah, I got the mimic.
And like, it's not going to even teleport me at the grace. Yeah, okay, I gotta go back because
it's annoying.
Can you?
Like, oh, it didn't let me spawn at the church America.
So happy I got a lantern before this.
Why is he so fucking fast for no reason?
Oh, please.
I just want to be like, oh my god. What's this?
I need to be over here.
What the fuck is this guy?
What is this?
I'm in the wrong spot. Sorry.
Hold on. My ear is itchy.
Oh, I don't want to do mob. I'm trying to get to the fucking... ow.
I'm going to kill me with the time I get over there.
Oh, I went the wrong way. I'm like, this doesn't look familiar.
Yeah, yeah, I'm trying to remember where it is.
You know, that's where I came from. Why is this guy still aggroing me?
You can't see me. I know, I need to go over here.
Oh, it's fucking this way. Oh, I forgot. I know where it is.
I forgot it's in the opposite direction.
Nope, I'm in the wrong spot again.
I'm in the wrong spot again. Yeah, because that's it.
Oh, yeah, because this is where you get invaded by the fucking white masks.
Oh, that's fucking...
That's right.
Oh, I can't use it until I... where am I going? I can drop it this way, it's fine.
I remember getting there.
Oh, I can't pick it up.
Because you avoid the little skeletors.
Yeah, go over here.
I remember seeing them and being like absolutely terrified.
I forget which way you go. It's not this way, because that's where you get raided.
Then you cut through over here.
Oh, that's a lie.
Yeah.
Over here, yeah, that's right.
Let's go! Where the fuck did the dudes all go?
Oh, they're on this down this way, I forgot.
I'm surprised I'm actually doing okay at level 50. I'm not going to lie to you.
Before I... I just wanted to grab this first, and I don't really care about my runes.
And then I want...
So, we heard that it's underground.
I want to go to the round table.
Oh, wrong way. I thought I almost had it.
D, you destroyed. Fuck. D, it's your fault.
I'm happy I didn't do that anyways. I don't have any fucking glove word.
I wish I could buy glove word.
You need to grind to level 140-ish? Yeah.
I can't believe you doubted me. How could you, me, of all people?
Well, I guess this is where we yapp together. This is the yapping portion of the stream where I grind stuff out.
I don't have an eighth. I mean a seventh. God damn it. I thought I had a seven. That doesn't matter.
I need to hurry. I need to hurry.
Yeah, I don't know why they allow the Dung Eater just to hang out.
Like he's like literally generally horrible.
How do I use the Mimic?
He isn't technically there. That's true, but still.
Yapping portion of the can at once. The love sum. Come, Eater.
Oh, did I roll into something over here?
I remember someone like bowed. I remember seeing someone just like gesture,
like email in front of the fucking armor. I think that was so funny. That was always funny to me.
I don't know how people email when they leave a message. I never figured that out.
Okay, if it's done, you don't have to worry about plumbing.
I should probably buy some arrows.
Oh, I have just like random shit.
I need strength.
That's so stupid.
Still have a heavy load.
Yeah, okay, I'm wearing PJs.
Sore seal in two hands. You're probably right. Yeah, that's a good idea.
I don't, I don't know if that'll do it though.
Does the sore seal give you five?
Yeah, it won't be enough.
Godric room. Yeah, I got that.
If I do that and I pop that, well, it's not like I don't need to use it appropriately.
I just need people to just shoot it.
Okay.
Why can I, can I not dual wield?
Yeah, let's do right that then.
Can't do it in, oh, that makes sense.
I'm like, where is it?
I'm just stupid. I'm just gonna do this to make my life easier.
What the fuck was that?
Left bumper aim. Oh, that's right.
Fuck, I miss.
Oh my god.
Yep, this will be fun. I should probably go buy arrows.
What a dummy.
You're the gold. Fuck, I don't want the gold scarab because I'm like, wait, usually you get more than
this. Oh, where's the gold scarab?
Where's the gold scarab?
How am I going to eat me?
In a dungeon in Caled. Oh, brother, it's, it's, it,
is it that one? It's that one, right?
Pretty sure it's this one.
Behind the dual, yeah, it's by the crystal bitches.
We're doing this first before I get the fourth talisman slot.
I'm gonna have to cut across to get on the other side here.
I may not fucking kill myself.
It's over there. It's on the other side.
I don't have the dragon barrow. Oh, this one. That's a smoldering wall.
What? Isn't the dragon barrow one? That's the great bridge.
I think I can make this jump.
Well, I definitely can't make the jump.
I wish I could just go over here and just like loop up and around. That just makes my life a lot easier.
Yeah, you can raise it just a lot closer.
Okay, let's do this first, just so I don't freaking kill myself for all.
Let's put this bad boy away. She's, she's a little bit big.
How's it hanging? That's going pretty good. I'm starting to go nonverbal because I'm EP.
No, not like this.
Let's not go live instead.
Ha ha.
He's staring at nonverbal, madam.
Ha ha.
Did I wake you up?
No, wait, I meant to go to the last
Christ visiting because it's just gonna teleport me down there. Sometimes I'd purposely throw
myself off a cliff to get to a like a steak America. Yeah, because now I'm fucking down here.
Wake me up. Wake me up. So save me.
Come on.
Madam, madam's thing is pretty. I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, what's a fucking
bed doll? Oh, that's a fucking sleepy lady. Where am I going? Where did you come from?
Where did you go? Where did you come from? Oh my god. Where are you?
I just lost 11,000 runes, bro.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I remember distinctly this happening before too when I was going
to this part.
Hi, Boomi. How can I help you handsome boy?
Are they a bird up here? No.
How did I not aggro the thing before? I don't get that.
All right, let's just walk. How about that? Let's just walk. Oh my god, Boomi.
Oh, oh my kitty. No, please. Why do you walk on my boob? You're still standing on my boobs.
Oh my god. Stop. Go away.
Why have you done this to me? What are you doing? I'm going to hold you like a baby.
Now you're stuck with me like this in baby mode. No, don't leave me. You can't leave now.
You're in baby mode. You have to be held like a little baby.
And I can give you scratches. Why are you so heavy? You're like this feels like your way as much as a toddler.
Why are you so big? Why did you become like that? Why are you looking at me?
Why won't you make eye contact with me?
He's like leaning away like mother, please. There you go.
Let's look into the snack box and see what we got. Shall we, Boomi?
Oh, don't attack my headphones.
Where's this? Like a little biscuit. It is called Delos and it is cappuccino flavored.
Boomi in baby mode. Yeah, Boomi in baby mode is literally just like holding him like he's the
baby and it's like he's on his back as the leggies are sticking out.
Marina and Boomi are just sniffing each other.
Marina, you look like you're about to hop up here.
Yeah, cappuccino.
How can this happen to me and me? I'm rubbing my eyes.
I'm fading. No, Marina, you're in the way.
Shut up. I don't need your sass. I didn't mean to press that.
Marina, get out. All I see is cat butt and a tail. Oh my god.
Marina just kicked the microphone.
Why are you flicking your tail? She's mad because I put her on the ground.
She's like, what the fuck?
All right.
Berry carefully.
Berry carefully. Jump. You made it.
Oh, good luck. I'm sure you're, I don't have to wish you luck because I'm sure you'll pass.
You don't need any luck. You got this.
A different moment from switching rooms. How is she? I'm fine. I'm here. I'm in the abandoned cave.
Feeling abandoned.
Okay, I'm just going to run to the boss room. I think I remember where the boss room is.
I remember doing the whole farm thing. It was more of the more recent things I had done in the game.
All right. Nothing I need to do that. Oh, fuck. I need, I need, I forgot. I need bloodhound step.
Oh, that's not the right one. Damn it.
I forgot.
I forgot that usually I would use just bloodhound step with this.
Is it shub over? Just a little bit.
I thought the staunching bowl was this for the right ones. Oh, this is going to be annoying.
I'm not going to go all the way to do that.
To do that, get that ash of war.
Yeah, digrow the quick step. No. That's what I meant. I'm sorry.
I thought I had the right boluses. I forgot. I had actually prepared for this. I didn't just jump in.
Oh, no. We totally have the fungus armor. What are you talking about?
I also don't have any fucking boluses.
I don't have any fucking cookbooks.
I suppose we're going to do a quick store run
to Caled. Oh, I can't leave.
At least I got the grace to care about.
It's funny that you can teleport from like, whatchamacallit.
Sounded like something was leaking in my bathroom. Ever get what I was saying?
No, I haven't been buying cookbooks. I've just been, I haven't been doing anything.
Hi.
Okay, so I can get those from you.
Oh, it's like I have to do so much shit in order to prepare for the fucking DLC.
I should have just played through the game again.
I was kidding. It'd be like a hundred hours.
You want me to butterfly?
Why did I do that? I didn't mean to press that. I meant to press that way.
Where do you, I have Reduvia, so I do have a dagger.
Oh fuck, but I can't put it on that.
Jody Daggers.
You don't, you're useless to me.
It's a journey and that's okay. I just like, I just, that's why I was always, I didn't know
whether or not I wanted to replay Elden Ring just because I'd have to do all this shit.
But I'm glad. I'm actually having lots of fun spending time with you guys.
I went the wrong way.
I know I did it, I'm fine.
Okay, Lude.
This is more yapping time. Yeah, but I want to get play the DLC guys.
You also don't have a dagger.
I like how this negates fire, but this is, this is funny.
I could get this for my outfit.
Bye-bye.
Lady from Round Table Shirtle Dagger, you're right.
What am I doing?
I placed that little cookie thing down somewhere and I don't know where it went.
I like never ate it. I just placed it on the ground, or not on the ground. Did I put it back
in the box? I swear I took it out. I have no idea where it went. I like put it somewhere.
Oh, it was next to me. It's like right next to my butt.
I'm like, I wanted to try this cappuccino cookie. Oh, it smells so good.
I wish I had coffee to make to eat this with it. Wait, I do have coffee to make to eat this with it.
Should I? Should I?
Should I make some coffee?
Hmm.
Let me not do this. Let me not drink coffee
at 10 p.m. because then I won't be able to sleep.
Am I going the right way?
I don't have any fucking money. Wait, let me see. Do you have a fucking dagger? You do. Okay.
I didn't see how much it was. How much is it?
400. Okay. I was about to drop 2000 for no reason.
99. Sleep tight. Don't let the madam bite. Just kidding. Let me bite.
I always wondered, what was this about? I never used it.
This one, like I know when you raid someone, like turns you into the host,
but does it like get rid of stuff? I don't know. And then this one as well.
You can like just, why would you want to do that?
You still look like a normal human. It's a troll item. Oh, it does get rid of your red aura?
That's funny. Hi, boo-me. Hi, boo-me.
Yeah, get your exercise. Nice job.
So like, am I the only person that can see him because he's technically not here?
But there's like just a bunch of shit in the library anyways.
It's really just like, is anybody like concerned about the absolutely gore that's in this room?
I'm really confused. Does nobody smell that? Yeah, it's Dungy.
And this guy doesn't do anything.
He just follows you around and leans against the thing and gives you a thing.
Gives you a e-boat. Look at his little hand. His little hands like holding on to him.
I know Rodericka can sense him.
Really, only the ones I can't, nobody, do you smell that? Well, you are kind of a skeleton
yourself, so maybe you don't smell that. Like, how he has that weapon as his weapon is the skeleton.
Gideon doesn't know where he is. He lives right now. Yeah, I'm like, I don't,
any, this whole place would smell like absolute shit.
Like, I don't, it's phantom, does that look like phantom poop to you?
Because like, he looks like phantom. This looks like real shit that I'm sloshing through
with real flies.
It's, yeah, shit and bodies.
The helmet protects tarnished from smells instead of head injuries, impressive.
Hiya, Boomi, what's up? Why are you trying to go for my feet?
That's the chain.
What? What do you want, Mr?
I think my headache medications make me sick.
Watch me, I've accidentally taken a Tylenol PM
so that was a horrible Tylenol, because I've done that before.
At least my head doesn't turn anymore.
So we're going to go...
Wait, where do I get quick step from?
Did you take earlier?
I'm 99% sure it's just normal ibuprofen. I'm just tired because I've been streaming since 130.
Have you seen a single toilet this whole game?
I'm pretty sure there is like an outhouse sort of thing.
Boomi, what are you up to? Is there something under my computer that you want?
You have a toy right there. He's just acting up.
The war master shack, yeah.
The dagger I just bought has quick step automatically.
Am I stupid?
I think I am. Anyways,
back to the cave. I feel like I'm very tired and I just want to remember you also.
I thought I had to get quick step.
Oh, it doesn't exactly have it.
That's not where I wanted to go.
I forgot you should probably like dodge the shit. Oh, like so.
I'm just like going through stuff. I'm not waiting for stuff to stop.
The head pat emo. I know I should get a head pat emo.
Oh, I keep going the wrong way.
That's the area of fucking Scarlet Rock.
Oh, I forgot the serpent bow is in here.
Oh, sorry.
I'm getting fucking terrified every time I see a
maiden. It's going to go this way really quick.
I don't think I went the right way. Oh, fun.
Ever get? Is there a grace?
No.
Raina, let's not hop up on my desk right now. Okay. You don't have to chirp at me.
Hi, Raina.
You have eye crusties.
There's a statue of America? I don't know. Is there?
Oh, Raina, you are hurting me with her. No, you can't.
She's like gripping my shoulders. I can't take her.
You're purring so hard. Raina, I need to put you on the ground.
Oh, all right. Well, I have a cat on me now. She is a cleaning baby, but I love her for that.
Oh, why did I go this way?
All right, tell me something. Just tell me that Boomi's going crazy right now.
Time to complete it in one go? Um, sure. I didn't. It's fine. Well, I shouldn't have done that.
Can you go after my other thing first?
Because I did shit wrong.
I accidentally gave him to the tagger.
Oh, no.
No. It's fine. It's fine.
Damn it. I feel like I could have gone that in one go.
I know I forgot to. I like walked in and I saw the dagger in my hand. I'm like, no.
I'm tired. That's my excuse. I'm tired.
Then I gotta do this shit. This will probably take me like one more.
I kind of sworn there was like a thing down here.
Come on. Come on. Come. No. Don't die. Don't die. No, don't.
Oh my god.
I think I need to go to bed after this.
That's the wrong way. Anyways, what am I doing? What am I stuck on?
Yeah.
Oh, wrong way. Oh, no.
Why don't you just go down? I'm gonna get poisoned.
Get out of the fucking way, bro. I have cat hair in my eye and Rena on my lap.
There's a rat.
I don't always got bit by a rat.
I don't know. I'm not just jumping over things.
No. Stop. No. Stop. Can you stop, please? I don't have any boluses for that. I'm just gonna die slowly.
Oh, this is great.
I just think I'd win if I walked in there.
I got poisoned grease.
I can wait.
Try to two hand the moon veil.
I'm literally gonna wait until this is done. Why is poison lasting forever?
I'm wondering if I should heal. Okay, then I might just heal and just go in and kill them.
Okay, yeah, I'm just gonna...
I call this one just like rises out of fucking nothing. You guys come over here.
Yeah, this is the same damage I'm doing.
Oh, I don't even think I needed him.
Use your fucking sword, bro.
I don't have any more. It's fine.
Yeah, I didn't even need the fucking mimic. I just grabbed the mimic just in case.
Oh my god, my eye hurts now.
I did not need the fucking mimic to heal for that.
Okay, I think it's time I go to bed. I'm still fucking poisoned.
Let me... So I got the golden scarab. I'm just gonna sit myself here.
I don't know why I need to get by fucking arrows.
I just want to set myself up for success. I think there was arrows. He had arrows.
I know it's almost over. No, it's not gonna be the perfect time. I'm not gonna be able to do this
fast enough. I'm already like freaking out.
Where's the dude? Oh no, where's the dude? He's over there.
No, I'm so tired. I also didn't sleep last night.
Hello. Hello.
Yeah, I didn't fall. Well, it's not like I don't stay up. I just don't fall asleep.
Those are bolts. I need arrows. It's like they know.
Well, I will take all of these. Thank you kindly. I think they know that we're gonna go see Moglin.
Moglin, Moglin. I don't need arrows for leveling.
Do I literally have just enough?
I do.
That's funny.
I need arrows for farming.
For a hug.
What? I'm so tired.
Yeah, I have a serpent bow.
Yeah, that's a great bow. This is normal bow. I know that the seeds are cane, but we really
don't need that for that. Is that anything on? Oh my god.
Fuck. I didn't equip arrows.
There. Whoopsies.
Nope. That's not what I want.
Is it? Oh, fuck. Hold on. Hold on.
Nope.
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. I bought normal arrows. What are you talking about?
Why is it?
Why wasn't it?
That was weird.
I forgot how to use a bow for a second.
Hey, come on. Yeet.
Yes, it's me.
This is going to take a while.
This is going to take a while. Farming for levels.
I might do this actually before I go to bed.
I haven't caught an icy stream yet.
Is it really that down bad? I don't. What?
What is the context of that question? Back to you being past the practice of the end.
Thank you. Oh, good. I'm so proud.
You did great, which was a mob that I don't know. I'm scream. That would be funny.
No. Oh, my guts are a little bit longer.
Mow dies tomorrow. The tree has a weird hitbox. I usually just, I do it when they're in between
the tree. Oh.
That's, this is how you know how fucking tired I am, bro.
Okay, let me grab my runes. And let's look at my cute little, my cute little outfit, my cute little bow.
Greenies in my arms and my eyes are itchy because I think I got like a piece of cat hair
and I blame Reina. I'm going to go knock out.
Hawaii.
I'm asleep. I know my sleep schedule has been so bad lately, guys. I don't even mean it to be,
even Boomi's coming over right now. He's like, come on. And then Reina just huffed at him.
She goes, and that's this morning.
We'll be right at the cause. Oh, perhaps, maybe just a little bit because I need to, I just
like staying up and spending time with you. Oh, me. Save.
I don't know why you don't want you to meet me. Oh, I'm like off to the side. Do I have any orders
for you tonight? Sleep well. I want you to, why are you asking me to tell you to do stuff when I'm
half asleep right now? I'm like, I'm falling asleep in my chair. Reina, I'm not open.
I want you to get yourself a cat boy outfit and dress up as a little cat. No, I'm kidding. Please
don't do that. Remember when I'm sleepy and my voice gets high?
Boomi,
you're planning a buying cat boy outfit. Anyway, it is for one reason.
Um, I don't know. I just hope you guys sleep well.
Over six hours. That's, I'm impressed with your attention span because I wouldn't be able to
watch myself for six hours. Jesus Christ. Oh, but thank you guys for hanging out with me all day.
Like, oh my gosh, or stopping by if you could. Um,
Reina, stop being so cute with your big eyes.
I wish I didn't have to work. Oh,
get some rest. I will.
Boomi, do you just kick glitter onto my computer?
Boomi, you're gonna mess up. I'm trying to time this properly.
It would be at 10, 10. She'd be marathon streamer. I don't mean to. I just like it.
Errah. What's fun popping in for a bit of beginning in meow. Yeah, thank you guys for stopping by,
stopping in, saying hi. And then we're stopping in, stopping by, saying hi.
Oh, maybe I'll, that'll be my outro for streams. Um, can we get, can we get a pet the madam emote?
No, you don't get to make demands of me. Excuse you. More Elden Ring tomorrow. Yes,
I'll probably stream early again. Actually, I do have to record a special ASMR.
And Boomi never, although he's finally actually laid in the bed. Like as I'm getting off,
now he wants to be comfy and cute in the bed. If he did it sooner, I would have put the cat cam on.
Because I like cat cam for long streams.
Um, but,
because I already ordered emotes, so I can't like just add another emote to it.
So that'll take a while if I do that. Um, because I didn't, did I add a pat emote?
I can't remember, because I had 10 emotes that I got that I could order. Um, Strani was telling me, so.
I missed, I see barrier stream didn't work, so it was good to still like, yeah, yeah.
Um, I'm sorry you missed your stream.
Of the recording, did you forget if I have to make a cover? Yeah, covers are hard to make. I'm happy that
like, Strani was pretty concise in what she wanted from us and being like, okay, do it like this.
I'm like, okay. And it worked out and it sounded at least a little bit of okay.
I think my bathroom fan is broken because it sounds like it's rattling.
Okay. I was getting distracted by things when I'm like falling asleep in my chair.
What do you have to pay to do covers? Um, like, well, we don't get like any copyright because
we didn't claim copyright or like, you just, if you're okay with not getting the money, then you
just like, you can go through the artist and ask for permission only if you want to monetize it.
We didn't monetize any of our music videos so they can't get claimed.
Yeah, no, I did not pay Ray William Johnson to sing his song.
That would be very cool though, but I'm not making any money off of singing his song. So
favorite line from your cover.
Butter ass was looking good up in the mom jeans.
Or the, or the, I approached her in the checkout line and said, oh, yeah. Oh, baby, what's up?
Yo, baby, what's up? That was pretty good.
Maybe the girls out. Stop. Don't look at them. Stop. Stop staring. Why are you pointing it out?
Why are you pointing it out, bro? You're making it weird.
Frick, it's 1012. Oh, you guys tricked me.
I'm easily distracted when I'm tired.
I love how my eyes glow.
Don't you have to go through the music labels to get permission to monetize the music?
I just said that. You have to go through the artists. If you want to monetize it,
none of our stuff is monetized.
Man, I will stay longer the more we talk. Shut up.
Yep. 1015.
Even. What's everyone doing?
No, you don't have to. No, I did not. No, not like that.
Tell us about the boy. No, I still have to watch the episode after this and I'm not going to make
it. So I'll probably watch it tomorrow morning. I have to go grocery shopping. Maybe I will go
grocery shopping just for a couple of days so I can have a couple of days worth of food instead
of ordering DoorDash. I'll get some uncrossibles. Is my favorite person in the boys? None of them.
I think every character has a hateable trait. Besides Kimiko.
So I guess Kimiko is my least hated character. I literally just looked at the talk of the time
because I'm like, it's a 17. Okay.
Girl, please stop. I hate everyone except you, I guess. Yeah, friend Jesus is annoying sometimes.
He just was like, I'm like, why do you, why do you do this? Why do you do stupid stuff? Even MMM?
Uh, MMM, everybody makes stupid decisions because I hate all of them because they're very human.
Excuse me. Oh no, I didn't mute. I'm being taken advantage of on my eepiness.
I'm leaving. Goodnight.
Why are you lying about my burp? Wait, where's my BGM? Where's my BGM? My BGM? I'm getting bigger.
No, I don't mean to be changing my model.
Okay, there's my BGM. BGM good. BGM's good. I'm over tired.
I'm gonna mute the desktop audio and close up other things. And then...
Hi. Bye. Oh, it's 10.15. Bye. Bye. I gotta go. I gotta end it. I gotta stop streaming.
