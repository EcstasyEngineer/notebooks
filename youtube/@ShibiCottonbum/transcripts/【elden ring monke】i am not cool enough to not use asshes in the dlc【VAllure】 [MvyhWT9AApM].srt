and just talk about lore do you would you guys be okay with me just rambling

157
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:29,020
about ASMR Roat Lore sorry boomies like scooping in the litter box for some reason

158
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,860
but then he just walked away so that doesn't make any sense to me you just

159
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:39,660
stuck his front half in Doug and then walk away yeah okay I would have to

160
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:48,900
watch and so what I will do I will watch an Elden Ring lore video and then I will

161
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:54,500
just record my reaction to it afterwards of me just rambling about it

162
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:59,500
Madame I think you should also consider what you like that's a good point but

163
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:09,500
like for me like I like there's ASMR like there's I feel like I feel like the

164
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:14,100
ASMR the VTubers do is a little bit different from like actual ASMR I won't

165
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:19,860
get you wrong because I also like visual ASMR but it's hard to do visual ASMR as a

166
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:24,580
VTuber I can't just like flutter my fingers around visually for you to see

167
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:29,340
it was actually kind of hard doing it with the camera like and I don't there's

168
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:35,460
one girl I watch Pomo ASMR and she manages to do it with like her mouth down

169
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:41,740
and I'm like how does she not accidentally get her face in frame

170
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:46,860
potentially VR ceased I don't know VR chat that is nothing to do with what I'm

171
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:54,500
asking but at some point probably I can lower okay so okay I'll make a I'm gonna

172
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:58,500

292
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:29,100

294
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,700

00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:09,580
yeah the frostable that are defrostable the uncrustable

298
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:18,460
I was talking to Strani about doing a song cover for Halloween I don't know if I'll be able to

299
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:23,660
get it in time but I'm hoping I can because the song is very hard it's a rap song

300
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:31,340
um not gonna tell you what it is although I've said I was gonna I've said I've said

301
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:37,980
songs I was gonna cover no it's not it's not bonfire I'm not covering bonfire

302
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:43,020
are they supposed to be frozen they are but you have to unthaw them because then that's

303
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:53,180
because they're too hard to eat it's not rap god um but it's it's it's it will take a while to record

304
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:58,460
because there's so many levels to it because you got like background vocals and other vocals and

305
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:07,500
like then you got a lot of ad-libbing but it'll be so worth it I hope hi little girl you grooming

00:39:46,140 --> 00:40:14,140
Sorry, please hold, I need to fix everything.

356
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:23,140
I didn't tap out, I accidentally kicked my thing again, but I tucked it a certain way that it shouldn't happen ever again.

357
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:25,140
I just like shoved it in between my wall.

358
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:32,140
It's probably not safe, but I locked it in place so that I can't kick it anymore.

359
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:35,140
Let me fix my microphone because it's going to sound like crap.

360
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:38,140
This is no filters on.

361
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:57,140
I'm typing in Heartless to a woman so instead of go XLR to a woman so hard.

362
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:02,140
The AI monster or JC no way, that's funny.

363
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:06,140
There's some funny AI songs.

364
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,140
You want some gamer subs?

365
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,140
I was called Fiyashibi.

366
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:22,140
When I went to the vet yesterday, I was going the wrong way.

367
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:27,140
Did you name Boomi after who I think you did?

368
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:30,140
I'm like, yeah, King of Umashu.

369
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:36,140
I'm like, and Fiyashibi is named after an Elderdring character and I'm like, I'm just a nerd.

370
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:40,140
The receptionist is just laughing at me.

371
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:46,140
I don't even think they knew what Elderdring is, but still.

372
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:58,140
No, yeah, I'm covering spooky scary skeleton sent shivers down your spine.

373
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,140
Yonka.

374
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:21,140
I'm sitting in the morning on the diner on the corner.

375
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:38,140
My nose is a cheat.

376
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,140
Yeah.

377
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,140
Living tombstone.

378
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:48,140
There's a, wait, there's a living tombstone version?

379
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:53,140
Is this person going to hunt me down?

380
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:55,140
Okay, they're not.

381
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:07,140
Sorry, I only know the OG because I'm a, I'm a, I'm a hipster.

382
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:08,140
Just kidding.

383
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:09,140
No, I know that one.

384
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:11,140
I just, it took me a moment to think of it.

385
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:17,140
As I sing living tombstone songs all the time, like every time I hear the word discord or

386
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:21,140
mention discord, my mind just automatically has to start singing discord.

387
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,140
I'm howling at the moon.

388
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:28,140
I did it in call yesterday when I was talking and when I was doing, not yesterday.

389
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:30,140
Uh, when I was in the collab.

390
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:41,140
Oh, they blow up again.

391
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:43,140
Didn't notice that.

392
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:58,140
I'm freaking went the wrong way.

393
00:43:58,140 --> 00:43:59,140
I've done this before.

394
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:10,140
Never get ready to go.

395
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:18,140
Now it's still hit me.

396
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:31,140
Sheeby heal and work it on it.

397
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:35,140
I shouldn't have used that flask accidentally over healed.

398
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:36,140
I'm Ari.

399
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:43,140
I want to be Tracer.

400
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:45,140
What about little maker?

401
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:47,140
I'm already with a marker.

402
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:51,140
Big fashion, nerf fashion.

403
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:53,140
Amy sang that last night.

404
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:54,140
Hell yeah.

405
00:44:54,140 --> 00:45:00,140
It seems like everybody had a good time in her, her members stream, which I'm glad for

406
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:02,140
singing some bangers.

407
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:03,140
Amy's a great singer.

408
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:06,140
Mercy's also great.

409
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:08,140
Honestly, all of us are great singers.

410
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:10,140
Me.

411
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:12,140
Not so much.

412
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:14,140
I'm okay.

413
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:16,140
Like thank God for mixing is all I'm going to say.

414
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:20,140
Azura is very good at singing.

415
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:22,140
Oh, hold on.

416
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:24,140
I'm just going to go out and die.

417
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:29,140
See, I didn't take too long to get back, you know, just like.

418
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:32,140
Let me just stand over here.

419
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:39,140
All right, go.

420
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:40,140
Go do stuff.

421
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:41,140
I'm going to die.

422
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:49,140
I just like this one rune candle.

423
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:56,140
Oh, I'm going to sit here and I'm going to heal with my one flask and I'm just going to.

424
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:58,140
Wow.

425
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:05,140
I'm dead.

426
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:06,140
That's fine.

427
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:07,140
I got to the stake America.

428
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:12,140
Like my impromptu karaoke singing.

429
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:19,140
I just know I don't have all the sacred tears.

430
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:23,140
So that's probably why like I don't, I don't get a lot.

431
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:25,140
Yeah, I was singing a lot this morning.

432
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:26,140
It's jamming.

433
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:34,140
I also, like you can see, I only have, I only have a what you're starting with that.

434
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:36,140
Come on, bro.

435
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:37,140
I'm not ready.

436
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:42,140
Oh, please.

437
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:46,140
Why do you got a teleport?

438
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:47,140
Well, I'm going to do this.

439
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:49,140
I'm going to get caught.

440
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:51,140
And then I'm going to go.

441
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:52,140
And I'm going to get caught.

442
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:56,140
And then I'm going to go over here and hide behind this thing and heal.

443
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:58,140
And then we're going to gang.

444
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:01,140
We're going to gang you after you're done.

445
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:02,140
I'll take the heat.

446
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:04,140
Ow.

447
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:07,140
No, don't use the magic.

448
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:08,140
Just, just slice them.

449
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:09,140
Just slice them.

450
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:11,140
Heal you fool.

451
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:16,140
Ah, I don't know.

452
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:19,140
I can never tell what the frick this guy teleports to do.

453
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:22,140
Stop trying to magic slice him.

454
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:23,140
Actually, you know what?

455
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:24,140
Fine.

456
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:26,140
That's maybe that'll be good for blood build up.

457
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:28,140
What?

458
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:31,140
Ah, fat man.

459
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:35,140
Why are you using the comet?

460
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:43,140
I'm getting set on fire.

461
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:47,140
Where'd he go?

462
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:51,140
Ow.

463
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:55,140
Nice, nice dodge.

464
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:57,140
Do you see his dodge?

465
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:58,140
Oh my God.

466
00:47:58,140 --> 00:47:59,140
That was lovely.

467
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:01,140
I'm so proud.

468
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:02,140
God damn.

469
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:05,140
Let me just heal real quick and not fuck this up.

470
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:12,140
All right, give him, give him a little stabby stab.

471
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:13,140
Come on.

472
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,140
Come on, Ash.

473
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:15,140
Go get him.

474
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:16,140
No.

475
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:17,140
One hit.

476
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:18,140
Yeah.

477
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:21,140
See, I should have done that, but I was too proud.

478
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:25,140
Give me my money.

479
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:29,140
Sick.

480
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:30,140
All right.

481
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:31,140
260?

482
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:32,140
Damn.

483
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:35,140
The drops for, the drops for runes are pretty nice.

484
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:38,140
Wait, where's the, is there, I just walk past the grace.

485
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:40,140
Hi.

486
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:44,140
He's one hit.

487
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:45,140
He's one hit.

488
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:47,140
All right.

489
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:48,140
Let's.

490
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:51,140
Are you kidding me right now?

491
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:55,140
Do I really need?

492
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,140
Oh, done.

493
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:57,140
Oh, done.

494
00:48:58,140 --> 00:48:59,140
Oh, my God.

495
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:01,140
Oh, my God.

496
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:03,140
Oh, my God.

497
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:05,140
Oh, my God.

498
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:06,140
Oh, my God.

499
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:07,140
Oh, my God.

500
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:11,140
Hey, what the shibbity?

501
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:13,140
Do I not have any?

502
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:16,140
What is that?

503
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:17,140
Oh, it's a vulgar bloom.

504
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:19,140
Do I not have any?

505
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:21,140
What was it called?

506
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:25,140
How many fricking runes?

507
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:28,140
All right.

508
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:30,140
It looks like I'll have to farm a little bit.

509
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:34,140
I don't like this.

510
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:36,140
It seems like a trap.

511
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:43,140
I'm pretty sure there's some flower bros around here.

512
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:45,140
I'm not really liking that.

513
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:47,140
I'm going to leave.

514
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:58,140
And I'm going to go someplace else because I don't want to lose my runes, guys.

515
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:00,140
Because you guys know I'm done.

516
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:01,140
I'll come back.

517
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:02,140
Don't worry.

518
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:03,140
Don't worry.

519
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:04,140
I'm just going to farm.

520
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:06,140
I'm going to farm those little little guys.

521
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:09,140
Add a.

522
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:12,140
Over here.

523
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:14,140
Check the second tab.

524
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:15,140
What do you mean?

525
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:17,140
Oh, oh.

526
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:20,140
Actually.

527
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:25,140
Golden vow.

528
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:28,140
Oh, did not know that was a thing.

529
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:32,140
I didn't know.

530
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:34,140
Golden vow was a wait.

531
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:35,140
Oh, I'm at the wrong grace.

532
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:40,140
Foli airs quest.

533
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:42,140
Perhaps.

534
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:43,140
I don't mean to sit down.

535
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:45,140
I don't know why I feel like I need to sit down.

536
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:57,140
Yeah.

537
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:59,140
Why are you so funny looking?

538
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:04,140
Wait.

539
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:05,140
Give me a second.

540
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:12,140
So the frickin perfumer talisman on.

541
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:13,140
Give me this, actually.

542
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:21,140
I haven't been.

543
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:25,140
Should I keep the Godfrey icon on?

544
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:28,140
I don't really need the flame strike talisman right now.

545
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:29,140
I will put.

546
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:35,140
How hard this raise the arcane to 14.

547
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:36,140

00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:39,140
I'll put the charge to his.

549
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:41,140
Hi.

550
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:45,140
She she beat the gradient jewelry and killed him.

551
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:47,140
Jewelry.

552
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:48,140
Oh, wait.

553
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:50,140
No, I was going to put on the golden scarab.

554
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:54,140
I'm going to take off the charge for a second and put on the gold.

555
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:56,140
Just so I can get some more stuff.

556
00:51:57,140 --> 00:52:01,140
And then I'll farm these dudes just because come on.

557
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:05,140

558
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:08,140

560
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:11,140
I know you can come in here.

561
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:12,140
You've done it before.

562
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:16,140
Come on.

563
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:17,140
You will see.

564
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:19,140
You will see pussy.

565
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:20,140
You will see pussy.

566
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:21,140
You will see pussy.

567
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:22,140
You will see pussy.

568
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:23,140
You will see pussy.

569
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:24,140
You will see pussy.

570
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:28,140
Charge tevies with perfume.

571
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:30,140
Yeah, but I'm not using the perfume right now.

572
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:37,140
You guys are going to gang me when I step outside the door.

573
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:38,140
I don't like that.

574
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:39,140
Just come in.

575
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:40,140
Yes.

576
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:42,140
You.

577
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:48,140
Eenie meenie miney you.

578
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:50,140
Actually, this might take too long.

579
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:52,140
You guys only give 3K.

580
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:54,140
I swear it was more than that before.

581
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:55,140
Maybe it's just more.

582
00:52:58,140 --> 00:52:59,140
And uh.

583
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:01,140

00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,140
How many how many rooms do I need?

585
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:08,140
Hold on, sir.

586
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:09,140
Please.

587
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:11,140
Hold on.

588
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:19,140
I need 46 and I'm at 31.

589
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:22,140
I have.

590
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:24,140
I know I have ranged magic, but I won't.

591
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:28,140
I prefer to slice people up because I'm a sick fuck.

592
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:31,140
I'm a sick fuck.

593
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:32,140
Like a quick fuck.

594
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:35,140
I like my dick sucked a little bit, but.

595
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:38,140
That's what we should cover.

596
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:40,140
You're such a fucking hoe.

597
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:41,140
I love it.

598
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:48,140
I'm sorry.

599
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:49,140
I'm picturing.

600
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:53,140
I'm picturing us singing that like real air doing a group cover

00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:55,140

602
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:01,140
Oh, that would just be so funny to me.

603
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:03,140
Oh my God.

604
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:05,140
I just need to kill one more dude.

605
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:09,140
In the Roblox outfits.

606
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:10,140
Yeah.

607
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:15,140
Wait, wait, what are the lyrics for that?

608
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:16,140
I kind of will look it up now.

609
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:20,140
Okay.

610
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:34,140
Your boyfriend is a dork.

611
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:35,140
Make loving.

612
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:39,140
Then I.

613
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:42,140
Where is it?

614
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:43,140
I'm a sick fuck.

615
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:44,140
I like a quick fuck.

616
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:46,140
I like my dick sucked a bio sick truck.

617
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:47,140
I'll buy you some new tits.

618
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:48,140
I'll get you that nip tuck.

619
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:50,140
How you started filming the condom slipped up.

620
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:51,140
I'm a sick fuck.

621
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:52,140
I'm inappropriate.

622
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:53,140
I like hearing stories.

623
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:54,140
I like the whole shit.

624
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:55,140
I want to hear most shit.

625
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:56,140
I like the whole shit.

626
00:54:56,140 --> 00:54:57,140
Send me some most shit.

627
00:54:57,140 --> 00:54:59,140
You trifling hoe bitch.

628
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:02,140
You're such a fuck.

629
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:08,140
It is too hard.

630
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:09,140
Let's follow behind.

631
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:11,140
She just like dancing behind me.

632
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:12,140
Just like.

633
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:14,140
I'll be a big yawn.

634
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:16,140
Squish, squish, squish, squish, squish.

635
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:17,140
Where's your paw?

636
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:19,140
They just upped her dose for her medicine.

637
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:23,140
And I think it's helping because they said that she was on too low of a dose.

638
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:25,140
And so she's already wiggling a little bit more.

639
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:26,140
Yeah.

640
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:29,140
And then she, she has her, she's on steroids.

641
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:31,140
Fia's, Fia's going to roid rage.

642
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:33,140
Gotta be honest, this song came on autoplay earlier.

643
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:34,140
Oh yeah.

644
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:36,140
Oh I didn't read the first half of that comment.

645
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:37,140
That's funny.

646
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:38,140
It came on autoplay.

647
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:44,140
I also like this song.

648
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:49,140
Um, I like the song with pink panther is in catering on his new album.

649
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:50,140
It's pretty good.

650
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:52,140
She's like, what are you doing with the song?

651
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:53,140
I'm gonna wrap up.

652
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:54,140
I'm gonna wrap up here.

653
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:55,140
I'm gonna wrap up here.

654
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:57,140
I'm gonna wrap up here.

655
00:55:57,140 --> 00:55:58,140
I'm gonna wrap up here.

656
00:55:58,140 --> 00:55:59,140
Yeah.

657
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:00,140
Not his new album.

658
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:01,140
It's pretty good.

659
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:06,140
Okay, thank you.

660
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:09,140
Oh.

661
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:17,620
Um, it's called Snap My Fingers.

662
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:20,260
I was listening to that today too.

663
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:22,780
Wish that I could snap my fingers.

664
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:24,140
La la la la.

665
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:26,340
Wish that I could.

666
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:38,460
The thing is when I sing, I mimic the singer's voice, so I can get pretty high, but it doesn't

667
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:54,860
sound good when I sing for Pink Panthers.

668
00:56:54,860 --> 00:57:00,140
It awaits inside.

669
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:01,140
What?

670
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:10,140
La la la.

671
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:11,140
Lil' Pomp.

672
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:13,140
She beat being Adele?

673
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:14,140
What?

674
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:19,140
Hella from the other side.

675
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:33,780
I must have called a thousand times to tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart and

676
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:35,780
in a minute.

677
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:37,420
I don't remember the lyrics.

678
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:38,420
Gotta be more British.

679
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:41,420
Oh, I am Adele.

680
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:42,420
Oh.

681
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:47,580
Hella from the other side.

682
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:49,900
What is all these messages?

683
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:52,180
Don't let it see you.

684
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:55,300
Once you are seen, there's no escape.

685
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:57,460
It cannot even be touched.

686
00:57:57,460 --> 00:58:01,180
Wait, I think I know what this is.

687
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:04,660
I think I know because I was listening to a lore video and I think I know what these

688
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:05,660
are.

689
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:06,660
There's a dude in the forest.

690
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:08,260
There's a dude here.

691
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:12,900
He's doing shit.

692
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:16,660
I think he's like the untouchable.

693
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:19,860
You can only parry them.

694
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:45,780
I don't know how to freaking parry.

695
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:50,500
What the fuck is the music?

696
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:55,060
Why are all the goats shush?

697
00:58:55,060 --> 00:59:02,260
Why are they all frenzied flame eyes?

698
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:05,740
Who the fuck is this dude?

699
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:08,900
Is he the one that's...

700
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:11,220
Oh no, I know who he is too.

701
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:12,220
He's the...

702
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:16,540
Who the fuck just died?

703
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:18,420
He's the one...

704
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:20,980
I forget what weapon he has.

705
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:25,540
It's not a fist, it's something else.

706
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:28,580
Guys, stop.

707
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:31,780
Stop making me scared.

708
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:33,780
Oh.

709
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:38,700
Oh, damn, frenzied flame.

710
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:40,980
That's me up.

711
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:46,780
Ow, yeah, he's like the fists of whatever.

712
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:52,820
Yeah, the maddening hand, that's who it is.

713
00:59:52,820 --> 01:00:02,220
Oh, I'm dead.

714
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:04,140
This guy just ganked me.

715
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:07,700
He's just punching the shit out of me.

716
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:17,700
Fee as a goat, sometimes in Fee-A-Me-O, she sounds like a goat.

717
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:24,940
Yeah, I'm like, what's up that date?

718
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:26,940
I'm getting absolutely rocked.

719
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:30,700
Let me change my stuff.

720
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:34,100
This is where Midra is, right?

721
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:35,580
I'm on the way to Midra.

722
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:39,660
Look at the little sheep.

723
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:42,260
I like their glowing eyes.

724
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:46,100
They look kind of pretty when they're infected with madness.

725
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:49,260
Can I summon?

726
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:53,820
Can I just abuse my summon?

727
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:58,780
Can I do good damage on him?

728
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:15,140
OK, I got the maddening hand.

729
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:19,300
I got the magic stick.

730
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:24,380
I love lamb chops, I'm scared.

731
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:27,700
Because I remember I was listening to lore about Midra the other day, so I know there's

732
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:33,820
a dude around here.

733
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:44,700
I don't remember what they look like, though.

734
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:46,220
I hear squeaky rats.

735
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:50,780
Wait, what's over there?

736
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:57,220
Oh.

737
01:01:57,220 --> 01:02:10,140
Make not a sound.

738
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:11,980
Quietly await your chance.

739
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:13,900
Combat is not an option.

740
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:18,300
Oh yeah, it is one of the dudes.

741
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:24,700
Because you got a crouch in the undergrowth?

742
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:35,340
They literally give you, you got to like, ooh, because you can kill them.

743
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:36,980
They are very cool looking.

744
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:43,740
They have like bulgy eyes.

745
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:51,780
You can kill them, but you got to parry each time.

746
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:55,420
And I can't block and parry, so.

747
01:02:55,420 --> 01:02:59,460
I don't know where I'm going.

748
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:02,620
I think they like slingy degushers, possibly.

749
01:03:02,620 --> 01:03:06,300
Wait, can I go that way?

750
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:07,940
Here's the map.

751
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:11,540
I kind of want to fight one.

752
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:12,540
How many runes do I have?

753
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:14,620
I only have 4,000, 5,000.

754
01:03:14,620 --> 01:03:17,900
I kind of want to see, hey.

755
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:19,620
Oh, frenzy.

756
01:03:19,620 --> 01:03:23,140
Because yeah, they're the untouchables, and you can't.

757
01:03:23,140 --> 01:03:28,140
Yeah, and you can only like, parry.

758
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:31,260
I'm maddened.

759
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:33,820
I don't know how to, ooh.

760
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:45,460
I picked up the parry dagger from the keep.

761
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:50,940
Too many warhead candies.

762
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:58,580
Bro, I think the caffeine is hitting me right now.

763
01:03:58,580 --> 01:04:00,140
I'm getting a little bit jittery.

764
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:03,500
All right, let me go towards the map.

765
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:11,860
Our heads do look squishy.

766
01:04:15,940 --> 01:04:16,540
Acquire me.

767
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:25,700
I don't like the squeaky rats.

768
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:26,460
You're a big one.

769
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:34,140
I do like frenzied flame.

770
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:35,140
Maybe I'll do a frenzied flame build.

771
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:39,140
Look, it's the map.

772
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:40,140
I'm the map.

773
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:41,140
I'm the map.

774
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:42,140
I'm the map.

775
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:56,140
I feel like if I bit one of their eyes, it would taste like some sort of sour orange candy.

776
01:04:57,140 --> 01:04:58,140
Mwah.

777
01:05:02,140 --> 01:05:04,140
OK, I got the abyss map.

778
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:05,140
Let's go.

779
01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:10,140
Let's look.

780
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:15,140
Finally, we got everything.

781
01:05:15,140 --> 01:05:16,140
Now I can see.

782
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:21,140
Hayata does eat those eyes.

783
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:22,140
That is correct.

784
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:23,140
Abandoned church.

785
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:24,140
Don't mind if I do.

786
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:27,140
Is there a scabba-dabba-do tree fragment?

787
01:05:27,140 --> 01:05:31,140
Yeah, scabba-dabba-do-ba-de-dabba-de-do-da-da.

788
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:33,140
I'm a scat man.

789
01:05:33,140 --> 01:05:34,140
Scabba-do-do tree.

790
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:36,140
My frenzied flame perfume bottle.

791
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:37,140
Oh, shit.

792
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:44,140
Reach out and touch grace.

793
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:55,140
I wish the status was useful on more than just NPCs.

794
01:05:55,140 --> 01:05:58,140
At that point, you basically just build for the damage.

795
01:05:58,140 --> 01:05:59,140
Code vein.

796
01:05:59,140 --> 01:06:00,140
Oh, I've never played that.

797
01:06:05,140 --> 01:06:07,140
OK, I'm just checking.

798
01:06:07,140 --> 01:06:08,140
I do not have enough.

799
01:06:09,140 --> 01:06:10,140
Oh.

800
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:21,140
Actually, I'm going to go real quick to the table of lost grace

801
01:06:21,140 --> 01:06:25,140
because I'm going to see if I can upgrade my ash.

802
01:06:25,140 --> 01:06:30,140
Although, I don't know if it really matters, but who knows.

803
01:06:30,140 --> 01:06:31,140
That's not the way.

804
01:06:36,140 --> 01:06:37,140
That's not the way.

805
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:51,140
I don't know why I just automatically came to you.

806
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:56,140
But I would have liked to actually if I had a spitting stone.

807
01:06:56,140 --> 01:07:01,140
Oh, I know I need a six.

808
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:02,140
It's not a five.

809
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:03,140
I need a six.

810
01:07:03,140 --> 01:07:04,140
All right.

811
01:07:09,140 --> 01:07:11,140
Guys, I'm scared to go in here.

812
01:07:16,140 --> 01:07:18,140
There's a lot.

813
01:07:18,140 --> 01:07:19,140
I'm scared.

814
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:25,140
This place is so freaking big.

815
01:07:28,140 --> 01:07:29,140
Oh, my God.

816
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:32,140
Got a parry.

817
01:07:32,140 --> 01:07:33,140
I can't parry.

818
01:07:33,140 --> 01:07:36,140
I don't even think why I can think I can go over here

819
01:07:36,140 --> 01:07:38,140
and try to fight Midra or whatever.

820
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:41,140
Wait, is this just a spooky forest?

821
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:43,140
I don't really see any like buildings in here.

822
01:07:48,140 --> 01:07:54,140
Actually, wait, where were those two hippos?

823
01:07:54,140 --> 01:07:55,140
There are.

824
01:07:55,140 --> 01:07:56,140
Where are those two hippos?

825
01:07:56,140 --> 01:07:57,140
There's two hippos.

826
01:07:57,140 --> 01:08:01,140
I was I didn't kill and I said I would do them later.

827
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:03,140
Where were they?

828
01:08:04,140 --> 01:08:05,140
Were they over here?

829
01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:09,140
Oh, my God.

830
01:08:09,140 --> 01:08:12,140
Where were they?

831
01:08:12,140 --> 01:08:13,140
Does anybody know?

832
01:08:19,140 --> 01:08:21,140
It was at the top of the dark like catacombs.

833
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:22,140
OK.

834
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:29,140
Carry and retaliation on a shield.

835
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:31,140
Oh, interesting.

836
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:32,140
That's pretty smart, actually.

837
01:08:35,140 --> 01:08:40,140
All right, let's see if we can kill those dudes.

838
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:42,140
I'm going to sip some of my suppies.

839
01:08:56,140 --> 01:08:59,140
I'm going to see if I can kill these.

840
01:08:59,140 --> 01:09:04,140
And then I might end it just to end it all just

841
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:08,140
because I want to make sure I rest a little

842
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:10,140
before the holocaer stream.

843
01:09:20,140 --> 01:09:21,140
Should I grab my runes?

844
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:30,140
Where the heck are they?

845
01:09:35,140 --> 01:09:37,140
Yeah, I was up top here.

846
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:56,140
Hey, are you licking yourself in your sleep?

847
01:09:56,140 --> 01:09:57,140
Or are you?

848
01:09:57,140 --> 01:09:59,140
What's happening here?

849
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:09,140
I missed.

850
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:10,140
Come back here.

851
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:11,140
Come here.

852
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:13,140
I'll get you.

853
01:10:13,140 --> 01:10:16,140
Does it not see me?

854
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:18,140
There we go.

855
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:20,140
That's just what's worked.

856
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:35,140
Narrowly missing death.

857
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:40,140
Making some stairs.

858
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:42,140
Making my way downtown.

859
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:43,140
Talking fast.

860
01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:45,140
Faces past and I'm homebound.

861
01:10:46,140 --> 01:10:49,140
And I need you.

862
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:51,140
And I miss you.

863
01:10:51,140 --> 01:11:01,140
And now I wonder if I could fall into the sky.

864
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:06,140
Do you think time will pass me by?

865
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:11,140
Because you know I'd walk a thousand miles

866
01:11:11,140 --> 01:11:15,140
so I could just fuck.

867
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:20,140
Wow, this is a lot easier on horseback.

868
01:11:20,140 --> 01:11:22,140
I should have listened to y'all.

869
01:11:27,140 --> 01:11:30,140
He wears his heart safety pin to his backpack.

870
01:11:30,140 --> 01:11:34,140
His backpack is all that he knows.

871
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:38,140
Ow.

872
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:43,140
Cripple heart and a vow where the soul.

873
01:11:54,140 --> 01:11:56,140
Oh, I accidentally aggroed the other one.

874
01:12:08,140 --> 01:12:09,140
Bad.

875
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:20,140
Die, die potato.

876
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:22,140
Not today.

877
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:26,140
I think.

878
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:33,140
I need luck on you now.

879
01:12:35,140 --> 01:12:36,140
Ow.

880
01:12:39,140 --> 01:12:41,140
Where'd you go?

881
01:12:47,140 --> 01:12:49,140
Come on, torrent.

882
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:54,140
Took a moment, he's just like, huh?

883
01:12:54,140 --> 01:12:56,140
No.

884
01:12:56,140 --> 01:13:00,140
Get his ass, get his ass, get his ass.

885
01:13:00,140 --> 01:13:02,140
Get him.

886
01:13:02,140 --> 01:13:05,140
Oh, I didn't think he'd be able to hit me.

887
01:13:06,140 --> 01:13:09,140
Get his asshole, get him in the asshole.

888
01:13:11,140 --> 01:13:13,140
Get him in the asshole.

889
01:13:21,140 --> 01:13:23,140
Come on, torrent.

890
01:13:24,140 --> 01:13:26,140
Oh, I, alright, let me heal.

891
01:13:36,140 --> 01:13:41,140
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

892
01:13:41,140 --> 01:13:43,140
Okay, cool.

893
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:48,140
Bazinga.

894
01:13:54,140 --> 01:14:00,140
Pinning at the disco, it's the used.

895
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:06,140
Hey, what's, how's the song go?

896
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:09,140
Try and think of that one song.

897
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:19,140
Thirteen!

898
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:22,140
Um, how's the song go?

899
01:14:23,140 --> 01:14:26,140
I don't know why I'm blanking.

900
01:14:27,140 --> 01:14:35,140
Oh, well imagine, as I'm pacing the pews in a church corridor and I can't help but to hear,

901
01:14:35,140 --> 01:14:39,140
no I can't help but to hear in exchanging of words.

902
01:14:39,140 --> 01:14:45,140
What a beautiful wedding, what a beautiful wedding, says the bridesmaid to the waiter.

903
01:14:45,140 --> 01:14:51,140
Yes, but what a shame, what a shame the poor groom's bride is a whore,

904
01:14:51,140 --> 01:14:53,140
is a bielder member.

905
01:14:53,140 --> 01:14:57,140
I chime in with the haven't you people ever heard of?

906
01:14:57,140 --> 01:15:03,140
Closing the goddamn door, no, it's much better to face these kinds of things,

907
01:15:03,140 --> 01:15:06,140
with a sense of poison rationality.

908
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:11,140
I chime in, haven't you people ever heard of?

909
01:15:16,140 --> 01:15:18,140
Whoa.

910
01:15:21,140 --> 01:15:27,140
Closing the goddamn door, no, it's much better to face these kinds of things,

911
01:15:27,140 --> 01:15:37,140
with a sense of poison rationality.

912
01:15:39,140 --> 01:15:42,140
Again!

913
01:15:42,140 --> 01:15:47,140
Where is, I'm just wandering the forest.

914
01:15:48,140 --> 01:15:53,140
Trying to get my runes so I don't have to keep staring at this stupid thing.

915
01:15:53,140 --> 01:15:55,140
Kill the rock.

916
01:15:55,140 --> 01:16:03,140
This is like the forest of, what is it called?

917
01:16:03,140 --> 01:16:08,140
Oh my god, why am I blanking on my favorite movie?

918
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:11,140
Where the R-U-U-S's?

919
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:13,140
It's the fire swamp!

920
01:16:14,140 --> 01:16:17,140
It's the fucking fire swamp.

921
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:20,140
You know, it would be awesome if they actually, I wouldn't be,

922
01:16:20,140 --> 01:16:25,140
I would totally see Frumsoft putting the fire swamp in a game.

923
01:16:30,140 --> 01:16:36,140
Bust out this thing, no, that was me blowing on the cap of my Gamer Sub's shaker.

924
01:16:36,140 --> 01:16:39,140
Okay, I need to grab that and run away.

925
01:16:39,140 --> 01:16:41,140
He needs to turn around.

926
01:16:41,140 --> 01:16:43,140
The fire swamp.

927
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:45,140
Burning area period, every time I died,

928
01:16:45,140 --> 01:16:49,140
it was when people thought it was a panic zone.

929
01:16:55,140 --> 01:17:01,140
Boop, wait, is my, I think my Uncrustable is done defying.

930
01:17:09,140 --> 01:17:11,140
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

931
01:17:16,140 --> 01:17:18,140
No, I don't.

932
01:17:20,140 --> 01:17:23,140
I do not have any of the talismans.

933
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:35,140
He didn't see me, I'm fine.

934
01:17:40,140 --> 01:17:44,140
Everything is honky-dory.

935
01:18:05,140 --> 01:18:07,140
Sorry, eating Uncrustable.

936
01:18:08,140 --> 01:18:14,140
It's the reduced sugar wheat strawberry jelly.

937
01:18:27,140 --> 01:18:29,140
Splash splash.

938
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:35,140
What? What?

939
01:18:35,140 --> 01:18:37,140
Ah, how did he see me?

940
01:18:41,140 --> 01:18:43,140
Flea.

941
01:18:54,140 --> 01:18:57,140
I know, I usually forget I have an Uncrustable too,

942
01:18:57,140 --> 01:18:59,140
because I like leave it out to thaw.

943
01:18:59,140 --> 01:19:01,140
Am I safe now?

944
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:07,140
No.

945
01:19:13,140 --> 01:19:15,140
I thought that was a golem against the wall.

946
01:19:15,140 --> 01:19:17,140
Where are you coming from?

947
01:19:19,140 --> 01:19:21,140
I just hear squeaking.

948
01:19:23,140 --> 01:19:25,140
Ah, there's so many.

949
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:32,140
This is a big forest.

950
01:19:35,140 --> 01:19:38,140
I touch the, oh, if I touch the plant.

951
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:43,140
What? I can't see a damn thing in this fog.

952
01:19:43,140 --> 01:19:45,140
That doesn't help at all, actually.

953
01:19:45,140 --> 01:19:47,140
No, thank you.

954
01:19:49,140 --> 01:19:51,140
Are they doing this on purpose?

955
01:19:51,140 --> 01:19:55,140
Why can I only see two feet in front of me?

956
01:19:57,140 --> 01:19:59,140
Like what?

957
01:19:59,140 --> 01:20:01,140
This is so weird, because it's just a line.

958
01:20:05,140 --> 01:20:07,140
What?

959
01:20:16,140 --> 01:20:18,140
Oh, what's this?

960
01:20:21,140 --> 01:20:24,140
Madness, stop, stop trying to fucking bought me.

961
01:20:24,140 --> 01:20:26,140
Me.

962
01:20:34,140 --> 01:20:36,140
Stop!

963
01:20:47,140 --> 01:20:50,140
I don't know where the hell a snake America is.

964
01:20:51,140 --> 01:20:53,140
He is pretty fast.

965
01:21:00,140 --> 01:21:02,140
Yeah, I can't call Torrent.

966
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:06,140
How far away?

967
01:21:06,140 --> 01:21:08,140
Okay, they're not that far away.

968
01:21:08,140 --> 01:21:10,140
All right, we gotta zoom.

969
01:21:20,140 --> 01:21:22,140
Yeah, then he fucking appears behind me.

970
01:21:22,140 --> 01:21:24,140
Can you stop?

971
01:21:24,140 --> 01:21:26,140
I'm stuck.

972
01:21:26,140 --> 01:21:28,140
I'm dead.

973
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:30,140
Goodbye, runes.

974
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:36,140
These guys are annoying.

975
01:21:40,140 --> 01:21:42,140
I might have to carry in retaliation

976
01:21:42,140 --> 01:21:44,140
before I go in the magical forest.

977
01:21:50,140 --> 01:21:52,140
I kind of want to...

978
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:54,140
I already went to the runes.

979
01:21:54,140 --> 01:21:56,140
What's up here?

980
01:21:58,140 --> 01:22:00,140
I don't think I went to the top.

981
01:22:06,140 --> 01:22:08,140
What's the main gauche?

982
01:22:10,140 --> 01:22:12,140
This makes me...

983
01:22:12,140 --> 01:22:14,140
Yeah, because you can't carry the both of them.

984
01:22:20,140 --> 01:22:22,140
How do I...

985
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:24,140
Where's the road?

986
01:22:28,140 --> 01:22:30,140
Is this the road?

987
01:22:30,140 --> 01:22:32,140
Oh, this is the road.

988
01:22:38,140 --> 01:22:40,140
Are the wolves gonna howl and drop from the sky?

989
01:22:40,140 --> 01:22:42,140
No, we're not in Stormvale.

990
01:22:42,140 --> 01:22:44,140
No.

991
01:22:48,140 --> 01:22:50,140
What?

992
01:22:50,140 --> 01:22:52,140
What the hell was that?

993
01:22:52,140 --> 01:22:54,140
What the fuck was that noise?

994
01:22:56,140 --> 01:22:58,140
What?

995
01:22:58,140 --> 01:23:00,140
What are you doing here?

996
01:23:06,140 --> 01:23:08,140
That's just...

997
01:23:08,140 --> 01:23:10,140
What the hell?

998
01:23:10,140 --> 01:23:12,140
Oh, I see.

999
01:23:12,140 --> 01:23:14,140
That's to fight the golem.

1000
01:23:14,140 --> 01:23:16,140
That's cute.

1001
01:23:16,140 --> 01:23:18,140
I don't really need that right now.

1002
01:23:18,140 --> 01:23:20,140
That makes sense.

1003
01:23:22,140 --> 01:23:24,140
Fingering guys?

1004
01:23:24,140 --> 01:23:26,140
What?

1005
01:23:28,140 --> 01:23:30,140
Was that a...

1006
01:23:30,140 --> 01:23:32,140
He is so far from such a crazy range.

1007
01:23:34,140 --> 01:23:36,140
Am I going the right way? I am.

1008
01:23:36,140 --> 01:23:38,140
There it is. Is it? I don't know.

1009
01:23:38,140 --> 01:23:40,140
I can't really tell.

1010
01:23:42,140 --> 01:23:44,140
There's a lot of wolfies up here.

1011
01:23:50,140 --> 01:23:52,140
The Assassin's Gambit of Ash of War

1012
01:23:52,140 --> 01:23:54,140
also allows you to run by them without aggroing them.

1013
01:23:54,140 --> 01:23:56,140
Just take it on a dagger and reapply.

1014
01:23:56,140 --> 01:23:58,140
Interesting. Fascinating.

1015
01:24:00,140 --> 01:24:02,140
That's pretty smart.

1016
01:24:08,140 --> 01:24:10,140
Alright, let me just do a cheeky 10.

1017
01:24:12,140 --> 01:24:14,140
I won't go to that church though.

1018
01:24:14,140 --> 01:24:16,140
Let's go to the church first.

1019
01:24:18,140 --> 01:24:20,140
And then we'll hop back on the road.

1020
01:24:20,140 --> 01:24:22,140
The most fingered guy actually?

1021
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:24,140
Is it the mother of fingers?

1022
01:24:30,140 --> 01:24:32,140
Oh, Rabbith.

1023
01:24:34,140 --> 01:24:36,140
We're running out of our names.

1024
01:24:36,140 --> 01:24:38,140
What did you do today?

1025
01:24:38,140 --> 01:24:40,140
I took a bath. Oh, perfect.

1026
01:24:58,140 --> 01:25:00,140
Contraption does not move.

1027
01:25:02,140 --> 01:25:04,140
That's crazy.

1028
01:25:06,140 --> 01:25:08,140
Come on, okay.

1029
01:25:10,140 --> 01:25:12,140
Never rob a Rabbith's rhubarb.

1030
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:14,140
Now say that five times fast.

1031
01:25:16,140 --> 01:25:18,140
Why is this a bigger than it actually is?

1032
01:25:20,140 --> 01:25:22,140
Very interesting.

1033
01:25:26,140 --> 01:25:30,140
I'm assuming there's also way to cheese into here.

1034
01:25:36,140 --> 01:25:38,140
No? Alright.

1035
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:42,140
Similar to Pokemon names, accurate.

1036
01:25:46,140 --> 01:25:48,140
Oh, what is this?

1037
01:25:52,140 --> 01:25:54,140
Well, well, well.

1038
01:25:54,140 --> 01:25:56,140
I need to find some fucking stupid rocks.

1039
01:25:58,140 --> 01:26:00,140
I know the shackle works, but the rocks are probably close.

1040
01:26:00,140 --> 01:26:02,140
Probably over here.

1041
01:26:08,140 --> 01:26:10,140
No? Sometimes it's like they're on a little hidden spot.

1042
01:26:14,140 --> 01:26:16,140
You might just use the shackle.

1043
01:26:20,140 --> 01:26:22,140
Rocks!

1044
01:26:22,140 --> 01:26:24,140
Rocks, where are you?

1045
01:26:24,140 --> 01:26:26,140
I'm probably blind.

1046
01:26:30,140 --> 01:26:32,140
I don't remember what the shackle looks like.

1047
01:27:00,140 --> 01:27:02,140
What?

1048
01:27:06,140 --> 01:27:08,140
What?

1049
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:10,140
I could have sworn...

1050
01:27:12,140 --> 01:27:14,140
Wait, why is there...

1051
01:27:16,140 --> 01:27:18,140
Why are these larval tears look so different from each other?

1052
01:27:22,140 --> 01:27:24,140
I didn't know that.

1053
01:27:24,140 --> 01:27:26,140
It looks like I don't have a shackle.

1054
01:27:26,140 --> 01:27:28,140
Ablehouch.

1055
01:27:32,140 --> 01:27:34,140
One from the deal.

1056
01:27:42,140 --> 01:27:44,140
Beast Eye.

1057
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:52,140
Wait, I don't have a shackle?

1058
01:27:52,140 --> 01:27:54,140
I got Margaret's shackle.

1059
01:27:54,140 --> 01:27:56,140
When I was trying to get Moog's shackle.

1060
01:27:56,140 --> 01:27:58,140
Am I blind?

1061
01:28:02,140 --> 01:28:04,140
Shackle isn't a key item.

1062
01:28:04,140 --> 01:28:06,140
Oh.

1063
01:28:12,140 --> 01:28:14,140
Bonicula.

1064
01:28:14,140 --> 01:28:16,140
What would it be under then?

1065
01:28:24,140 --> 01:28:26,140
I'm actually super sleepy.

1066
01:28:26,140 --> 01:28:28,140
What's happening to me?

1067
01:28:34,140 --> 01:28:36,140
Do I not have it?

1068
01:28:38,140 --> 01:28:40,140
Maybe I just don't have one.

1069
01:28:40,140 --> 01:28:42,140
I could have sworn...

1070
01:28:42,140 --> 01:28:44,140
One tab over?

1071
01:28:46,140 --> 01:28:48,140
Oh, there it is.

1072
01:28:48,140 --> 01:28:50,140
Go.

1073
01:28:56,140 --> 01:28:58,140
I'm silly.

1074
01:29:02,140 --> 01:29:04,140
What the...

1075
01:29:12,140 --> 01:29:14,140
Let's try that again.

1076
01:29:14,140 --> 01:29:16,140
Excuse me, small deer.

1077
01:29:18,140 --> 01:29:20,140
Where am I supposed to land?

1078
01:29:20,140 --> 01:29:22,140
On either side, probably.

1079
01:29:24,140 --> 01:29:26,140
It's like, I can't really see...

1080
01:29:26,140 --> 01:29:28,140
What the hell?

1081
01:29:30,140 --> 01:29:32,140
Alright, after this, I'll do that later.

1082
01:29:32,140 --> 01:29:34,140
It's not really important right now.

1083
01:29:34,140 --> 01:29:36,140
I want to see what's at the top of this ridge.

1084
01:29:40,140 --> 01:29:42,140
Forget it.

1085
01:29:42,140 --> 01:29:44,140
Forget it all.

1086
01:29:48,140 --> 01:29:50,140
Alright.

1087
01:29:56,140 --> 01:29:58,140
No marionette brothers.

1088
01:29:58,140 --> 01:30:00,140
It's the Mario Brothers except they're marionettes.

1089
01:30:02,140 --> 01:30:04,140
This one just like froze.

1090
01:30:06,140 --> 01:30:08,140
This looks neat.

1091
01:30:08,140 --> 01:30:10,140
What is this place?

1092
01:30:10,140 --> 01:30:12,140
It looks like a giant greenhouse.

1093
01:30:12,140 --> 01:30:14,140
On the map.

1094
01:30:14,140 --> 01:30:16,140
Is there a tibia mariner here?

1095
01:30:16,140 --> 01:30:18,140
Because this is definitely the area

1096
01:30:18,140 --> 01:30:20,140
where a tibia mariner would chill.

1097
01:30:22,140 --> 01:30:24,140
Ooh, is a grace.

1098
01:30:26,140 --> 01:30:28,140
Oh, a meter.

1099
01:30:28,140 --> 01:30:30,140
Oh.

1100
01:30:30,140 --> 01:30:32,140
I see.

1101
01:30:34,140 --> 01:30:36,140
I wonder why there's a very random grace in here.

1102
01:30:38,140 --> 01:30:40,140
Oh, madame.

1103
01:30:40,140 --> 01:30:42,140
What? It looks like a greenhouse.

1104
01:30:42,140 --> 01:30:44,140
Look.

1105
01:30:44,140 --> 01:30:46,140
Doesn't it look like a greenhouse on the outside?

1106
01:30:46,140 --> 01:30:48,140
Looks like a, you know, it's pretty.

1107
01:30:48,140 --> 01:30:50,140
There's like glass and stuff.

1108
01:30:50,140 --> 01:30:52,140
I don't know.

1109
01:30:52,140 --> 01:30:54,140
Can I open this?

1110
01:31:04,140 --> 01:31:06,140
Or a cathedral?

1111
01:31:06,140 --> 01:31:08,140
I don't know what that is.

1112
01:31:08,140 --> 01:31:10,140
It's a cathedral.

1113
01:31:10,140 --> 01:31:12,140
Ooh.

1114
01:31:12,140 --> 01:31:14,140
Hello.

1115
01:31:14,140 --> 01:31:16,140
Who are you?

1116
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:20,140
Oh, you're an actual person.

1117
01:31:22,140 --> 01:31:24,140
We?

1118
01:31:24,140 --> 01:31:26,140
Sorry, my sword's in your face.

1119
01:31:28,140 --> 01:31:30,140
Oh, met her.

1120
01:31:36,140 --> 01:31:38,140
Don't bite the...

1121
01:31:38,140 --> 01:31:40,140
Can we get our DLC spells?

1122
01:31:46,140 --> 01:31:48,140
Oh.

1123
01:31:48,140 --> 01:31:50,140
Thanks.

1124
01:31:52,140 --> 01:31:54,140
You're really chill.

1125
01:31:54,140 --> 01:31:56,140
What do you, what do you mean?

1126
01:31:56,140 --> 01:31:58,140
Spooky Woods were fine.

1127
01:32:08,140 --> 01:32:10,140
Thank you.

1128
01:32:14,140 --> 01:32:16,140
You're really kind.

1129
01:32:18,140 --> 01:32:20,140
Yeah? You can see it in my eyes?

1130
01:32:22,140 --> 01:32:24,140
I'm a fighter.

1131
01:32:32,140 --> 01:32:34,140
I do.

1132
01:32:34,140 --> 01:32:38,140
Bring the bells and get the spells.

1133
01:32:42,140 --> 01:32:44,140
That was a very pregnant pause.

1134
01:32:44,140 --> 01:32:46,140
Study sorcery.

1135
01:32:46,140 --> 01:32:48,140
Wow.

1136
01:32:48,140 --> 01:32:50,140
Ooh.

1137
01:32:54,140 --> 01:32:56,140
Oh, perfect. I can get retaliation from you.

1138
01:32:56,140 --> 01:32:58,140
Sick.

1139
01:32:58,140 --> 01:33:00,140
What's this one?

1140
01:33:00,140 --> 01:33:02,140
Miriam's vanishing.

1141
01:33:02,140 --> 01:33:04,140
Cool.

1142
01:33:04,140 --> 01:33:06,140
If only I had some fucking money.

1143
01:33:10,140 --> 01:33:12,140
The little boy?

1144
01:33:14,140 --> 01:33:16,140
There's a little boy in here?

1145
01:33:18,140 --> 01:33:20,140
I'm gonna kill him.

1146
01:33:22,140 --> 01:33:24,140
I can't see.

1147
01:33:24,140 --> 01:33:26,140
Where's the boy? I'm gonna kill him.

1148
01:33:26,140 --> 01:33:28,140
I'm gonna kill this little child.

1149
01:33:28,140 --> 01:33:30,140
Where's the child?

1150
01:33:30,140 --> 01:33:32,140
Where's the child? Give me the child.

1151
01:33:32,140 --> 01:33:34,140
Hand over the child. Give me the baby.

1152
01:33:34,140 --> 01:33:36,140
Show, show me the child.

1153
01:33:36,140 --> 01:33:38,140
So remember those finger ruins on your map?

1154
01:33:38,140 --> 01:33:40,140
Oh, okay.

1155
01:33:40,140 --> 01:33:42,140
Yep. So those are the...

1156
01:33:42,140 --> 01:33:44,140
I probably like to underground.

1157
01:33:46,140 --> 01:33:48,140
I don't see a little boy in here.

1158
01:33:50,140 --> 01:33:52,140
Give me the kid so I can kill him.

1159
01:33:54,140 --> 01:33:56,140
Where is he?

1160
01:34:00,140 --> 01:34:02,140
Where is he?

1161
01:34:02,140 --> 01:34:04,140
Check the grave outside?

1162
01:34:04,140 --> 01:34:06,140
Oh, so he's already dead?

1163
01:34:06,140 --> 01:34:08,140
That's too, too bad.

1164
01:34:08,140 --> 01:34:10,140
I wanted to do it myself.

1165
01:34:16,140 --> 01:34:18,140
There's a lot of graves.

1166
01:34:20,140 --> 01:34:22,140
Hello?

1167
01:34:30,140 --> 01:34:32,140
Why is your heart beating so fast?

1168
01:34:38,140 --> 01:34:40,140
I don't see anybody.

1169
01:34:46,140 --> 01:34:48,140
What? Are you talking?

1170
01:34:48,140 --> 01:34:50,140
It's wiggling near him?

1171
01:34:50,140 --> 01:34:52,140
What are you...

1172
01:34:52,140 --> 01:34:54,140
I was charging my Tamagotchi,

1173
01:34:54,140 --> 01:34:56,140
so I think the kid is dead.

1174
01:34:56,140 --> 01:34:58,140
I...

1175
01:34:58,140 --> 01:35:00,140
Guys, I don't see anybody.

1176
01:35:06,140 --> 01:35:08,140
So I'm going to get Chris Hansen

1177
01:35:08,140 --> 01:35:10,140
because I want to kill kids?

1178
01:35:10,140 --> 01:35:12,140
What's worse than a rapist?

1179
01:35:12,140 --> 01:35:14,140
A child!

1180
01:35:16,140 --> 01:35:18,140
There's a grave I can inspect?

1181
01:35:22,140 --> 01:35:24,140
Oh!

1182
01:35:26,140 --> 01:35:28,140
Okay.

1183
01:35:32,140 --> 01:35:34,140
He's there later?

1184
01:35:34,140 --> 01:35:36,140
He's already dead!

1185
01:35:38,140 --> 01:35:40,140
Show up and fight me!

1186
01:35:42,140 --> 01:35:44,140
Alright, well...

1187
01:35:56,140 --> 01:35:58,140
I kind of wanted a mini boss.

1188
01:36:00,140 --> 01:36:02,140
He's more than one kid?

1189
01:36:02,140 --> 01:36:04,140
I'll kill him all then.

1190
01:36:10,140 --> 01:36:12,140
You surprised me.

1191
01:36:12,140 --> 01:36:14,140
Wait, the guy on his...

1192
01:36:14,140 --> 01:36:16,140
This is when his boy is dead?

1193
01:36:16,140 --> 01:36:18,140
It was the boy with Tamagotchi all along.

1194
01:36:18,140 --> 01:36:20,140
I don't know where I'm going.

1195
01:36:20,140 --> 01:36:22,140
What's happening over here?

1196
01:36:22,140 --> 01:36:24,140
I'm just looping back around.

1197
01:36:24,140 --> 01:36:26,140
Hey.

1198
01:36:28,140 --> 01:36:30,140
There's so many of you here.

1199
01:36:30,140 --> 01:36:32,140
Why are you guys like all at this side?

1200
01:36:32,140 --> 01:36:34,140
Let me unlock.

1201
01:36:36,140 --> 01:36:38,140
Ooh, what's that over there?

1202
01:36:38,140 --> 01:36:40,140
Is there anything we can have?

1203
01:36:40,140 --> 01:36:42,140
Oh look, it's little pigs!

1204
01:36:42,140 --> 01:36:44,140
Oh wait, these are wolves.

1205
01:36:44,140 --> 01:36:46,140
I thought they were pigs.

1206
01:36:48,140 --> 01:36:50,140
They're weird spirit ashes?

1207
01:36:50,140 --> 01:36:52,140
Starlight? I fucking hate starlight shards, man.

1208
01:36:52,140 --> 01:36:54,140
They don't do shit.

1209
01:36:56,140 --> 01:36:58,140
Those wolves still aggroing on me?

1210
01:36:58,140 --> 01:37:00,140
Oh, yep. Sorry.

1211
01:37:06,140 --> 01:37:08,140
Wait, he has five kids?

1212
01:37:08,140 --> 01:37:10,140
Or did I kill five Tamagotchis?

1213
01:37:10,140 --> 01:37:12,140
I don't recall.

1214
01:37:12,140 --> 01:37:14,140
What are you holding?

1215
01:37:14,140 --> 01:37:16,140
What is that?

1216
01:37:16,140 --> 01:37:18,140
What are they holding?

1217
01:37:18,140 --> 01:37:20,140
Oh, they can use Glintstone magic?

1218
01:37:20,140 --> 01:37:22,140
I don't know how a

1219
01:37:22,140 --> 01:37:24,140
puppeteered thing

1220
01:37:24,140 --> 01:37:26,140
can use Glintstone magic.

1221
01:37:26,140 --> 01:37:28,140
Because technically,

1222
01:37:28,140 --> 01:37:30,140
they're not alive.

1223
01:37:30,140 --> 01:37:32,140
They're robots.

1224
01:37:32,140 --> 01:37:34,140
So I want to know more about that.

1225
01:37:34,140 --> 01:37:36,140
No, not robots, if you guys know what I mean.

1226
01:37:38,140 --> 01:37:40,140
There's another NPC in the church.

1227
01:37:40,140 --> 01:37:42,140
Alright, well, let's go chat with them.

1228
01:37:44,140 --> 01:37:46,140
Nice t-shirt, thanks.

1229
01:37:50,140 --> 01:37:52,140
I can't see.

1230
01:38:04,140 --> 01:38:06,140
What the heck?

1231
01:38:06,140 --> 01:38:08,140
I feel like there should be shit around here.

1232
01:38:08,140 --> 01:38:10,140
These bugs are just

1233
01:38:10,140 --> 01:38:12,140
big chilling.

1234
01:38:12,140 --> 01:38:14,140
Or they're dead, I can't really tell.

1235
01:38:20,140 --> 01:38:22,140
Okay.

1236
01:38:26,140 --> 01:38:28,140
Oh, it's you!

1237
01:38:28,140 --> 01:38:30,140
Move.

1238
01:38:32,140 --> 01:38:34,140
You have a really cool outfit.

1239
01:38:34,140 --> 01:38:36,140
What the hell? Hold on, let me just...

1240
01:38:36,140 --> 01:38:38,140
What?

1241
01:38:38,140 --> 01:38:40,140
You look pretty fucking sly.

1242
01:38:40,140 --> 01:38:42,140
I knew you were a woman.

1243
01:38:46,140 --> 01:38:48,140
Can I have your sword?

1244
01:38:50,140 --> 01:38:52,140
Only...

1245
01:38:52,140 --> 01:38:54,140
There is one thing I would say.

1246
01:38:54,140 --> 01:38:56,140
Count Enya's kindness as a gift.

1247
01:38:56,140 --> 01:38:58,140
Should you cross him,

1248
01:38:58,140 --> 01:39:00,140
you will sorely regret it.

1249
01:39:00,140 --> 01:39:02,140
Can I kill you?

1250
01:39:02,140 --> 01:39:04,140
There is nothing more.

1251
01:39:04,140 --> 01:39:06,140
Can I attack her?

1252
01:39:10,140 --> 01:39:12,140
I kind of want her outfit.

1253
01:39:12,140 --> 01:39:14,140
Does she have any important

1254
01:39:16,140 --> 01:39:18,140
lore or

1255
01:39:18,140 --> 01:39:20,140
quests?

1256
01:39:26,140 --> 01:39:28,140
I can get her fit in a jail.

1257
01:39:28,140 --> 01:39:30,140
We're in a passive zone.

1258
01:39:30,140 --> 01:39:32,140
Oh, I can't fucking...

1259
01:39:32,140 --> 01:39:34,140
You're so lucky I can't kill you right now.

1260
01:39:34,140 --> 01:39:36,140
I'm spamming all my buttons

1261
01:39:36,140 --> 01:39:38,140
to attack.

1262
01:39:38,140 --> 01:39:40,140
It does look like a small sauron, that's why I want it.

1263
01:39:44,140 --> 01:39:46,140
How do I do her quest?

1264
01:39:48,140 --> 01:39:50,140
Where is her jail?

1265
01:39:50,140 --> 01:39:52,140
Is it in the...

1266
01:39:52,140 --> 01:39:54,140
Can I kick this candle over?

1267
01:39:54,140 --> 01:39:56,140
I just want to destroy things.

1268
01:39:56,140 --> 01:39:58,140
Look at this fancy candle bra.

1269
01:39:58,140 --> 01:40:00,140
Dead.

1270
01:40:00,140 --> 01:40:02,140
Kill the candle.

1271
01:40:02,140 --> 01:40:04,140
Kill it.

1272
01:40:04,140 --> 01:40:06,140
I can't. Kill it.

1273
01:40:06,140 --> 01:40:08,140
Break everything.

1274
01:40:08,140 --> 01:40:10,140
Break everything in the room.

1275
01:40:14,140 --> 01:40:16,140
Ring some bells.

1276
01:40:16,140 --> 01:40:18,140
Ring it.

1277
01:40:20,140 --> 01:40:22,140
Or get her and her sister...

1278
01:40:24,140 --> 01:40:26,140
I don't care about the summons.

1279
01:40:26,140 --> 01:40:28,140
I'd rather get her katana

1280
01:40:28,140 --> 01:40:30,140
cause it looks fucking sick.

1281
01:40:30,140 --> 01:40:32,140
It looks like it has

1282
01:40:34,140 --> 01:40:36,140
the death flame or whatever the fuck on it.

1283
01:40:38,140 --> 01:40:40,140
I want her outfit.

1284
01:40:40,140 --> 01:40:42,140
She's wearing an interesting outfit.

1285
01:40:42,140 --> 01:40:44,140
I can't tell...

1286
01:40:44,140 --> 01:40:47,260
that she's a finger, finger person.

1287
01:40:47,260 --> 01:40:49,100
Cat food dispenser might've lovin'.

1288
01:40:51,540 --> 01:40:53,180
Is in a jail near Bonnie?

1289
01:40:53,180 --> 01:40:54,460
Okay.

1290
01:40:54,460 --> 01:40:58,980
All right, well, we'll do that next time on Chibi Elden Ring.

1291
01:40:58,980 --> 01:41:00,060
Whoa!

1292
01:41:00,060 --> 01:41:02,940
I'm gonna go chill, feed the cats.

1293
01:41:02,940 --> 01:41:05,540
He is looking up like, hello?

1294
01:41:05,540 --> 01:41:06,740
If he didn't really eat this morning,

1295
01:41:06,740 --> 01:41:08,740
so she's probably hungry now.

1296
01:41:08,740 --> 01:41:10,420
Squish, squish, squish, squish, squish, squish, squish.

1297
01:41:10,420 --> 01:41:11,900
Squish the baby belly.

1298
01:41:12,740 --> 01:41:13,860
He he he he he.

1299
01:41:13,860 --> 01:41:15,860
What are you doing?

1300
01:41:15,860 --> 01:41:20,620
Um, in a cult Iris for the catana?

1301
01:41:20,620 --> 01:41:21,660
Do I have that?

1302
01:41:23,860 --> 01:41:25,260
I think I do have that.

1303
01:41:27,180 --> 01:41:29,540
Where, where would that be?

1304
01:41:33,620 --> 01:41:35,660
Like, I actually think I do have that.

1305
01:41:36,500 --> 01:41:39,500
Is this like, is this a shield the person from Grace, right?

1306
01:41:39,500 --> 01:41:40,620
Is it consumable?

1307
01:41:41,900 --> 01:41:42,740
Yeah.

1308
01:41:54,620 --> 01:41:55,860
Is that, is that it?

1309
01:41:55,860 --> 01:41:58,180
Yeah, baby!

1310
01:42:00,260 --> 01:42:01,940
Yippee!

1311
01:42:01,940 --> 01:42:03,820
I have it.

1312
01:42:03,820 --> 01:42:05,380
All right, we'll do that.

1313
01:42:06,420 --> 01:42:10,060
Oh, I'm gonna get ready for the Holocure stream.

1314
01:42:10,060 --> 01:42:12,380
Never played a Holocure before.

1315
01:42:12,380 --> 01:42:13,220
Well, there you go.

1316
01:42:13,220 --> 01:42:14,340
We killed Jory.

1317
01:42:14,340 --> 01:42:15,860
We killed some hippos.

1318
01:42:15,860 --> 01:42:19,180
We, you know, we got some, we got some,

1319
01:42:19,180 --> 01:42:22,020
got some scabadabada fragments.

1320
01:42:24,340 --> 01:42:26,540
Next time on Shibi Elden Ring,

1321
01:42:26,540 --> 01:42:29,540
Shibi is set on finding a set of armor in Catana.

1322
01:42:29,540 --> 01:42:31,180
Her track takes her to explore.

1323
01:42:31,180 --> 01:42:32,740
Will she find the armor?

1324
01:42:32,740 --> 01:42:34,500
Find out next time.

1325
01:42:35,340 --> 01:42:39,100
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce.

1326
01:42:40,260 --> 01:42:41,100
Yeah, but maybe we'll,

1327
01:42:41,100 --> 01:42:42,620
maybe I'll play some Eldering after Holocure.

1328
01:42:42,620 --> 01:42:43,460
Who knows?

1329
01:42:46,300 --> 01:42:47,140
Yeah.

1330
01:42:47,140 --> 01:42:49,220
All right, let me raid someone.

1331
01:42:52,420 --> 01:42:54,100
Let's see, let's see, let's see.

1332
01:42:57,580 --> 01:43:00,140
Will she sip Mesmer once more?

1333
01:43:01,620 --> 01:43:02,980
Let's give it e-shirts.

1334
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:08,180
Let's see, let's see, let's see.

1335
01:43:14,580 --> 01:43:15,740
No, I don't want to look at Anna.

1336
01:43:15,740 --> 01:43:17,420
Please, just bring me to my level.

1337
01:43:21,580 --> 01:43:22,420
There we go.

1338
01:43:23,780 --> 01:43:24,820
Probably use the same thumbnail.

1339
01:43:24,820 --> 01:43:26,140
Do you guys like the thumbnail I made?

1340
01:43:26,140 --> 01:43:28,300
I love my thumbnail, what I mean?

1341
01:43:28,300 --> 01:43:29,820
I like my silly thumbnails.

1342
01:43:30,740 --> 01:43:34,300
Strony's doing a watch along.

1343
01:43:35,420 --> 01:43:36,980
Watch along, VV.

1344
01:43:38,380 --> 01:43:40,260
Florence, I, what?

1345
01:43:40,260 --> 01:43:41,340
When is she watching?

1346
01:43:42,860 --> 01:43:44,860
She's watching, I've never heard of that.

1347
01:43:48,740 --> 01:43:52,460
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce.

1348
01:43:54,220 --> 01:43:57,100
All right, since Strony, my love,

1349
01:43:58,100 --> 01:43:59,860
since she's gotten a second to raid her,

1350
01:43:59,860 --> 01:44:01,860
I don't want to wait an hour to raid her.

1351
01:44:03,380 --> 01:44:05,140
That, that weird lady.

1352
01:44:05,140 --> 01:44:06,780
But I hope you guys understand what I said

1353
01:44:06,780 --> 01:44:08,340
at the beginning of the stream and stuff.

1354
01:44:08,340 --> 01:44:12,580
Like, don't, I'm a Sino, taking a little break, chilling,

1355
01:44:12,580 --> 01:44:15,060
trying to avoid stressing myself out of things

1356
01:44:15,060 --> 01:44:17,700
and perpetuating things that I don't need to.

1357
01:44:17,700 --> 01:44:19,140
I care about you guys a lot.

1358
01:44:20,540 --> 01:44:23,620
Interaction will mostly be streamed and stuff.

1359
01:44:23,620 --> 01:44:25,180
You guys are lovely.

1360
01:44:25,180 --> 01:44:26,180
I kind of want to take a nap.

1361
01:44:26,220 --> 01:44:28,420
I might take a quick nappy poo.

1362
01:44:28,420 --> 01:44:30,820
Quick, quick little nappy, nappy nap.

1363
01:44:32,420 --> 01:44:33,380
After I feed Fia.

1364
01:44:35,900 --> 01:44:36,860
But yeah.

1365
01:44:38,140 --> 01:44:40,420
You still have to wait for the fansly stream.

1366
01:44:40,420 --> 01:44:43,380
Wah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

1367
01:44:43,380 --> 01:44:44,500
When that'll be?

1368
01:44:45,820 --> 01:44:46,660
I don't know.

1369
01:44:46,660 --> 01:44:50,260
Wah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

1370
01:44:50,260 --> 01:44:52,700
Am I too, am I early through the stream?

1371
01:44:52,700 --> 01:44:53,540
Very early.

1372
01:44:54,420 --> 01:44:55,580
I'm about to leave.

1373
01:44:56,340 --> 01:44:57,700
So go, go sleep, Stroney.

1374
01:44:59,940 --> 01:45:04,940
But yes, you are sucking limbo forever, trapped.

1375
01:45:07,860 --> 01:45:09,740
Oh, it feels so good.

1376
01:45:09,740 --> 01:45:10,580
I love you guys.

1377
01:45:10,580 --> 01:45:11,420
Thank you.

1378
01:45:11,420 --> 01:45:12,260
Thank you for understanding.

1379
01:45:12,260 --> 01:45:13,420
No brain worms, okay?

1380
01:45:14,580 --> 01:45:15,620
I'm avoiding brain worms.

1381
01:45:15,620 --> 01:45:16,740
You're avoiding brain worms.

1382
01:45:16,740 --> 01:45:18,060
We're all happy.

1383
01:45:18,060 --> 01:45:19,420
Lem, lem, lem, lem, lem.

1384
01:45:19,420 --> 01:45:22,660
Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah.

1385
01:45:22,660 --> 01:45:24,580
Let's be making out with your face.

1386
01:45:24,720 --> 01:45:29,240
Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah.

1387
01:45:30,300 --> 01:45:32,620
You're on a wait, because you have a girlfriend.

1388
01:45:39,540 --> 01:45:40,580
Get out of here.

1389
01:45:44,380 --> 01:45:45,220
Get out.

1390
01:45:46,860 --> 01:45:48,040
I'm your only girlfriend.

1391
01:45:50,620 --> 01:45:51,460
Anyways.

1392
01:45:51,460 --> 01:46:03,620
Um, so I hope you guys, I hope you guys, I just turn around and put a gun at him and

1393
01:46:03,620 --> 01:46:10,580
I'm like, in hindsight, I think he was referring to me, but it's fine.

1394
01:46:10,580 --> 01:46:11,860
It's, it's, it's funny.

1395
01:46:11,860 --> 01:46:13,300
It's funnier for the memes.

1396
01:46:13,300 --> 01:46:16,300
Um, someone had a wife.

1397
01:46:16,300 --> 01:46:20,500
That's different.

1398
01:46:20,500 --> 01:46:21,500
I think.

1399
01:46:21,500 --> 01:46:22,500
I don't know.

1400
01:46:22,500 --> 01:46:27,500
I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll come up with an excuse why that was okay later.

1401
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:28,500
Okay.

1402
01:46:28,500 --> 01:46:29,500
Bye.

1403
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:36,900
Cause they had his Johnny, you'll see you in a little bit.
