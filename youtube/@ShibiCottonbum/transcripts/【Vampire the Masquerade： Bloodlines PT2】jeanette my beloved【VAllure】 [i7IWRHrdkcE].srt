9
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,900
it's me

10
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,860
your favorite, madam

11
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,840
it's so nice to see everybody

12
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,040
Wow, so many beautiful faces in this crowd.

13
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,280
My heart is going doki doki.

14
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,080
Oh, so many well wishes.

15
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,080
What do I do?

16
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,680
We forgot monetization pose.

17
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,680
Let's fucking go.

18
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,680
Oh my god, my back hurts.

19
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,760
Hello, hi.

20
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,120
Hello, yes.

21
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,280
Oh god, that scared me, I just get so red.

22
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,640
Yeah, but I hope you guys are doing well.

23
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,840
I'm doing lovely, minus I randomly got a migraine

24
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,160
and I'm like, what the hell?

25
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,720
I just woke up from a nappy nap.

26
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,160
To hope, and I went away a little bit

27
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:19,560
because of the nap and I took some acetaminophen.

28
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,280
You know a little bit about acetaminophen.

29
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,880
I really great acetaminophen.

30
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,200
I'm so excited.

31
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:33,520
Being, getting monetization and being a YouTube partner

32
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,040
has been a goal of mine since I was a teenager

33
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,720
making really stupid videos on the internet

34
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,480
and it feels really good.

35
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,280
I'm just healing my inner child.

36
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,280
I was crying so hard yesterday, tears of joy

37
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,480
and I know like it might not mean a lot to some of you

38
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:56,280
when you're just like, oh, it's whatever, it's this, it's that.

39
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,160
It's the principle of just like a long-term goal of mine.

40
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,720
It's like a decade in the works, just like,

41
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,600
even if it's a small milestone, but I hit it

42
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,720
and it means so much to me.

43
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,560
Like I turn the background, you might hear them running around

44
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,720
and Fia stole Boomi's toy

45
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,760
and so Boomi's not really happy about that.

46
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,440
But we're gonna have, it's so funny.

47
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,640
Strawni messages me and she's like,

48
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,800
when are we gonna have monetization stream?

49
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,640
Am I, Strawni, I told you, I said it was Sunday

50
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,600
and I don't know if she saw like literally above

51
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,520
like her message was me saying,

52
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,480
I'm having my monetization stream Sunday.

53
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,640
She's like, when are we having your monetization stream

54
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,480
is the next message?

55
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:58,280
I'm like, I think she just like sent it

56
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,280
and she's just like, did it, did it, did it.

57
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,760
That was funny, but yes, we're gonna have it Sunday.

58
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,840
I'm gonna try to get my,

59
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,600
I'm gonna try to get my toes done tomorrow.

60
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,600
I need them like book an appointment at the place tomorrow.

61
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,920
I should probably do that ASAP.

62
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,160
I probably should have done that before I fell asleep

63
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,840
and then we'll do it Sunday.

64
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,960
We're gonna be doing, I'm gonna have,

65
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,360
I need to set up my camera.

66
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:33,280
We're gonna be having thigh slash footsie cam.

67
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,640
I don't know how I'm gonna point it like under my desk.

68
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,400
That's gonna be so weird.

69
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,800
I don't know if that'll be allowed.

70
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,480
I'll have to think of like where I can put it.

71
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,080
Put the camera.

72
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,960
Cause I don't think YouTube will take kindly

73
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,560
to me doing like an up skirt sort of thing.

74
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,400
I don't know.

75
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,280
And I have to find, I don't know what to do with my tripod.

76
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,920
And I don't know if my camera will reach.

77
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,480
But yeah, I'll figure, I'll do all that.

78
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:14,320
Yeah, it'll be at my normal time at 4 p.m. on Sunday.

79
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,520
And then I can't even remember what else was on the schedule.

80
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,280
But yeah, and so we're doing that.

81
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,640
And we're gonna be eating some Japanese snacks.

82
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,480
You know how hard it is for me not to,

83
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,440
I've been holding on to this box of the soccer box

84
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,640
for like since I debuted now.

85
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,360
Cause somebody got it off my throne.

86
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,720
Cause I'm like, oh, I want to do this for like a,

87
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,760
like a membership stream or just like a stream in general.

88
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,800
And then I'm like, ooh, is it actually good for that?

89
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,080
And so we'll be trying some Japanese snacks.

90
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,400
I'm very excited.

91
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,480
I am not as dexterous as my mother.

92
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:59,160
So as my momay, I still have the Tito's on my desk.

93
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,000
I look like a fucking alcoholic.

94
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,640
If somebody came in to be like, wow,

95
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,480
what the fuck?

96
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,280
I just have a giant bottle of Tito's.

97
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,160
What did you get?

98
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,000
I haven't opened it yet.

99
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,800
I have no idea what's in the box.

100
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,080
What's in the box?

101
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,000
And then the week after,

102
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,640
I want to do a membership stream

103
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,040
or rewatch master of disguise.

104
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,840
I don't know how like watch alongs work.

105
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,840
I've never done a watch along.

106
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,480
I don't even know like how I'll get the,

107
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,640
like where we'll watch it.

108
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,480
I don't know.

109
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,320
I'll figure it out.

110
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,160
I have to ask Strani.

111
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,240
But that'll be on the day

112
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,240
that I can't remember off the top of my head.

113
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,640
I was getting really bombed.

114
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,480
If it's aimed at your feet,

115
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,480
will we get a cat cameo?

116
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,320
Oh, a hundred percent.

117
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,080
You guys will see my messy ass house in my cats.

118
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,120
So it'll be good.

119
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,080
Oh, maybe I can angle it.

120
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,760
So it looks like it's at my cats,

121
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,240
but it's actually at me.

122
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,080
Because it's like,

123
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,840
because Reina usually sleeps by my feet.

124
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,760
And so I can be like,

125
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,240
you guys can't see what I'm doing.

126
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,000
But yeah, it's if it's awesome.

127
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,480
I'm so happy.

128
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,880
I cried so hard yesterday.

129
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,520
It's like 1am and I was already half asleep.

130
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,720
You know, I woke up this morning

131
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,640
and I looked at my counter and I realized

132
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,720
I don't even remember this.

133
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,920
I made tea last night

134
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,920
and I don't even remember making tea.

135
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,640
I mean, it was just like left out.

136
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,960
And I was like, oh,

137
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,800
am I not totally enough to join the turtle club?

138
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,960
But yeah, it's going to be fun.

139
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:37,920
I am determined to also hopefully hit like 5k this week

140
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,200
or this upcoming week.

141
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,280
And it really sucks.

142
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,880
Because I was looking at my schedule

143
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,400
that my management sent me for my real job

144
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,400
and my hours are like really shitty.

145
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,760
And it would,

146
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,040
I would end up overlapping.

147
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,160
What the fuck is on my arm?

148
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,000
A bug?

149
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,840
Okay, no, it's not.

150
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,680
It's a piece of dust.

151
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,960
I was like, hello, sir.

152
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,200
Because I'll have to overlap with the Zera a lot.

153
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,200
Because I worked till like,

154
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,520
one day I worked till nine

155
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,280
and I'm just like, oh, I don't,

156
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,360
I can't do like an early morning stream.

157
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,200
And I just hope like,

158
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,200
I just, I don't know why they haven't made me part-time yet.

159
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,680
I think my boss called me right before I started stream,

160
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,680
but I didn't answer because I'm like, I'm doing stuff.

161
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:33,680
So I'll call back my store after I finished stream today.

162
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,120
But I'm hoping that the call was about like,

163
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,040
hey, we're just going to put you on part-time immediately

164
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,760
because I'm like, oh, great.

165
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,840
I'm working 11 to eight and 12 to nine.

166
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,920
That's so great.

167
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,680
Oh my God, every day this week.

168
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,520
Wow.

169
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,520
Thank you.

170
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,560
Thank you so much.

171
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,080
Oh, and you didn't schedule my proper days off

172
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,800
and you took my normal Wednesdays off.

173
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,720
Thank you so much.

174
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,360
Wow.

175
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,200
Thank you.

176
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,040
At least you got my Saturday days off right.

177
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,720
But yeah, I'll be going back to my job

178
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,320
after almost a three month leave

179
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,680
because your girl is depressed-y-s-y

180
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,800
and I also had a lot of health problems going on

181
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,440
and it was really affecting my work.

182
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,600
I was at risk of losing my job

183
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,400
because I was in so much pain that I couldn't go to work

184
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,720
because I love a fibroflare up

185
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,320
because I was so stressed out.

186
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,440
And they were just like talking to me

187
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,120
and be like, you need to work on your numbers,

188
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,160
your sales numbers.

189
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,480
And I'm like, I don't, I really don't give a shit.

190
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,920
Like I'm just trying to live right now.

191
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:41,240
And that's when Fiya was like not able to walk.

192
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,320
Her legs didn't work

193
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,840
and I had to take care of her and do all her meds

194
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,000
and also take care of myself at the same time

195
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,320
and then take care of Boomi and Reina

196
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,240
and still give them and love and attention

197
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,000
and then still also maintain relationships

198
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,320
outside of my job, like with my family and my friends.

199
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,040
And it was just, it was too, too, too much.

200
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,280
I couldn't handle it.

201
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,320
But I'm going back.

202
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,160
I feel better.

203
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,320
I'm in a better place.

204
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,520
Although if they don't switch my schedule over soon,

205
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,440
I'm probably just like, I might just quit

206
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,240
because I wanted to stay for reasons

207
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,120
but I don't think I'll be able to.

208
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,720
But we'll see.

209
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,160
Yeah, I'm very thankful

210
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,440
that I was able to get a temporary leave.

211
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,440
Yeah, Fiya is doing much better.

212
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,960
She is running all over my house.

213
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,520
She can jump.

214
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,840
She frolics about, she, what is she doing?

215
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,960
Boomi's just watching her like slam a toy

216
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,720
into my trash can and it's kind of funny

217
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,040
because she, I gave them both their favorite toy

218
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,920
with just a little spring toy

219
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,600
and she immediately fucking knocked it under my fridge.

220
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,000
And then Boomi got all sad

221
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,320
because then Fiya threw it

222
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,640
because Boomi likes to play fetch.

223
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,880
So I threw his and then Fiya got it.

224
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,920
And then Boomi looked at me like,

225
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,480
mama, what, why did you throw it to her?

226
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,800
I'm like, I didn't do it.

227
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,840
You were just too slow

228
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,800
and she got to it before you did.

229
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,880
But yes, we're making moves.

230
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,960
We're making strides.

231
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,120
It was so funny.

232
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,560
Do they keep you awake at night?

233
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,080
No, they wake me up early in the morning.

234
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:12,920
That's what they do.

235
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,320
They actually sleep with me really well at night.

236
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,560
Boomi becomes a sudden love bug at night.

237
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,880
They always sleep by my feet, on my feet.

238
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,440
Reina sleeps by my head.

239
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,160
That's Boomi right now, if you heard him, yeah.

240
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,920
What's the matter?

241
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,320
Where'd your toy go, sweetheart?

242
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,040
Did Fiya take it?

243
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,120
Did she knock it under the fridge?

244
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:40,960
Probably.

245
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,560
He looks so upset.

246
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,320
Yes, they're very dog-like.

247
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,920
But yeah, so I was gonna say

248
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,320
it was a really funny coincidence.

249
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,440
I'll read you off something.

250
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,000
I'm just gonna be ventriloquist for a second.

251
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,560
But I randomly got this notification from this thing

252
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,720
I used to be subscribed to about like,

253
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,880
it wasn't like horoscopes,

254
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,000
but just like things to like meditate on.

255
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,520
What the fuck has happened?

256
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,840
Hold on, I need to check on my cat.

257
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,960
Reina, are you okay?

258
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,280
Did you just fall?

259
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,600
Fall.

260
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,760
Fall.

261
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,680
I'm trying to find Reina and I'm walking around

262
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,640
and she jumped into my fucking laundry.

263
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,520
I don't know, my dirty clothes hamper.

264
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,560
And so I just look at her in the bathroom

265
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,080
and she's just staring up at me with her dark face

266
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,880
and big eyes like, hello.

267
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,040
I'm sitting and wallowing in your stink.

268
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,280
But the message I got says,

269
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,960
abundance and confidence and badly this is the finest times

270
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,400
where diligence can pay off.

271
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,920
Even if success isn't immediate, it will come.

272
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,800
You'll feel on track with some sort of measurable return

273
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,360
such as respect, greater self-worth,

274
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,560
financial gain, improved stability or security.

275
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,000
And I'm like, wow, that's so crazy

276
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,560
because literally all my dreams just came true yesterday.

277
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,680
Wow, when my dreams came true when I joined Vealer,

278
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,280
but you guys know what I mean.

279
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,840
It all goes on at 5 a.m.

280
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,520
It's supposed to be the end of the day.

281
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,080
You guys are quiet today.

282
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,240
What's going on?

283
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,480
What's up with that?

284
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,360
Everybody's so quiet.

285
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,520
There's like, Mathem, we're just here to hear.

286
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,520
We're just here to hear you, yeah.

287
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,360
I'm in a game.

288
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,200
I'm working.

289
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,040
Okay.

290
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,360
Scream, scream.

291
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,320
Okay, actually you just reminded me

292
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,960
because you just said you achieved your life.

293
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,240
I need a tweet that I am live.

294
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,440
Oh, I'm right now, oh my God.

295
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,240
She just jumped up on my nose.

296
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,160
Well, I hope you guys are having

297
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,840
a good productive day today.

298
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,360
Sorry, I'm just gonna tweet out on why.

299
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,320
For all my little habits.

300
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,000
Why?

301
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:38,160
But yeah, you can, you'll expect more later streams next week.

302
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,440
All I can say.

303
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,680
All right, I'm gonna go ventriloquist for a second

304
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,200
while I retweet at my all the count.

305
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,400
Did I even retweet it?

306
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,680
All right then.

307
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,800
I need to pull out a tharboop today, what the hell?

308
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,640
Hi.

309
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,080
Hello, hello.

310
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,080
I'm not being productive.

311
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,080
It's not a sheebie, sheebie, no, yeah, I'm being.

312
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,920
All right, I didn't get much done as of today.

313
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,240
I had a weekend off, so I'm good now.

314
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,320
Oh, it's good for you.

315
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,000
Very good for you.

316
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,200
No problem, arrange your schedule,

317
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,800
hope it freezes you, actually.

318
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,640
Yeah.

319
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,040
I would, I'll actually, I do,

320
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,800
I've always liked streaming in the middle of the day,

321
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,720
like people who have watched me before,

322
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,440
I usually actually streamed at like 12

323
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:36,120
or even 10 a.m. Eastern sometimes, a.m.

324
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,520
Cause then I just like stream all day and it's great.

325
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,440
Okay.

326
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,560
I'm gonna, I'm practicing today.

327
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,040
I am not gonna yapp as much.

328
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,400
Yeah, we're gonna get into the game now.

329
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,360
Yes, I'm very EU friendly when it comes to streaming.

330
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,040
If my game will load, it will.

331
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,120
I'm trying something new

332
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,600
because you're more energetic as there are times.

333
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,560
Yeah.

334
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,720
Maybe.

335
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,600
I don't know, actually.

336
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,760
I think because like they're,

337
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,960
cause I used on Twitch and like everybody

338
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:31,960
and their fucking mom would stream at,

339
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,000
come on, come on, they're probably gonna wake up.

340
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,640
Sometimes it doesn't show up until, well,

341
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,600
there we go.

342
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,280
Everybody was streaming and it would be like,

343
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,560
it would just be like 20 people,

344
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,240
people that I also like to watch myself

345
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,960
just streaming all at the same time.

346
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,040
And I just, I,

347
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,920
I just knew I couldn't compete with the time slot

348
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,120
being such a small creator.

349
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,640
So I just like to stream in the middle of the day

350
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,880
and it was fun and then I had a lot of EU friends.

351
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,080
What have I done with the real sheebie?

352
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,240
Game's on.

353
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,960
All right.

354
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,400
Whoopsie daisies.

355
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,920
Not even 40 minutes of yet.

356
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,920
Yes, I'm sorry to let you down.

357
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,920
I'll be honest because of my migraine.

358
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,000
I don't have a lot to talk about today.

359
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,640
And I was looking back at my body yesterday

360
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,600
and I realized I only played two hours

361
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,600
to call the lamb.

362
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,200
And then I just talked for four hours after that.

363
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,360
Oh, where'd my coffee go?

364
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,560
Let me grow my coffee.

365
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,880
If you guys are quiet, I'm quiet.

366
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,440
We're having a chill, the rainy day outside.

367
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,200
I might feel a little bit of thunder.

368
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,000
I'm in a good mood.

369
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,760
He he he.

370
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,920
Put my headphones on.

371
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,280
We're compensated with pull on all third-gamer movements.

372
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,080
Damn, the game is loud.

373
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,320
Okay, where was I? I was in the haunted house.

374
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:48,360
I think I might get new headphones because I wish there was a sort of transparency mode on these.

375
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,280
I feel like my ears are blocked when I play.

376
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,920
I don't like it.

377
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,240
I'm probably mad when it's hot, by the way.

378
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,240
I don't like it.

379
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,240
I'm probably mad when it's hot, by the way.

380
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,240
I don't like it.

381
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,800
Vampire madam is hot, by the way.

382
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,800
Oh, yes, you like vampire madam.

383
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,800
I wish to fuck your blood.

384
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,600
I said fuck.

385
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:17,760
Fuck.

386
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,040
Fuck.

387
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,360
Fuck.

388
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,480
V-sucky.

389
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:23,840
Whoa!

390
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,760
Focus on noise.

391
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,400
Alright, I remember what I was doing.

392
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,600
Okay, I'm here now.

393
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,520
Why am I so high up?

394
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,600
Can I like be a little bit lower?

395
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,920
Okay, none of these doors.

396
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,240
Okay, well, it seems like I go through here.

397
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,840
Nice.

398
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,600
Shower, no mirrors, because I'm a vampire.

399
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,160
I swear I'm already getting motion sick.

400
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:00,880
Digit.

401
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,880
I walked over to this and just shut off. Okay.

402
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,000
Uh, um...

403
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,840
Can you please give me time to react to things?

404
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,640
Oh my god, look at all the cobwebs.

405
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,400
Oh, she was waiting for me.

406
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,440
Ah, ow!

407
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,720
Fucking, no!

408
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:23,560
Damn it.

409
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,560
I can't dodge stuff.

410
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,800
Okay, I'm just gonna follow the lady.

411
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,000
Lady, come back!

412
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,000
Oh.

413
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,000
Okay, do I go in here?

414
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,480
Nope, nope, nothing in there either.

415
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,240
How do I reset the camera?

416
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,760
Because I feel like I'm like flying above her.

417
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,400
Camera, what?

418
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,840
Fit fine, okay, whatever.

419
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,760
I meant, mouse, oh my, oh, maybe.

420
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,880
Do it a little bit less.

421
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,160
What does mouse filter mean?

422
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,840
Lady, come back, you can blame it all on Sheepie.

423
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,520
Oh my god, this is a wraith whipping things that are in her rage.

424
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,680
No!

425
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,800
Well, if I can't go that way.

426
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,680
Um, I presume I...

427
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,000
Yo!

428
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,840
Oh, damn, I am...

429
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,360
I almost said I'm...

430
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,560
I'm acoustic.

431
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,480
That doesn't make any sense.

432
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,280
Oh, is it on fire?

433
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,480
That makes sense.

434
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,760
It's very sparkly, it's kind of pretty.

435
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,160
I like the purple flames.

436
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,280
Purple flames, purple flames.

437
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,680
Is there something that I should be doing here?

438
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,240
It's in here.

439
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,920
Not this fucking music.

440
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,640
Oh no!

441
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,760
Oh god, I can definitely jump over this.

442
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:36,880
Oh!

443
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,800
What the fuck?

444
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,200
Are you serious?

445
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,800
I didn't think you would kill me!

446
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,200
It didn't even give me, like, any warning.

447
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,920
Oh my god, I'm already like a third of my health is gone.

448
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,720
Um, which way was it?

449
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:22,920
This way?

450
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,720
No, this way.

451
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,200
No, this way.

452
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,680
Okay, it doesn't matter.

453
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,880
We're back where we were.

454
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,720
This game is very forgiving for...

455
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,440
Okay, don't touch the fucking purple fire.

456
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,000
Shibi, how about that?

457
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:44,920
All right.

458
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:49,960
Is that going to hurt me?

459
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:50,560
Ow.

460
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,040
Jesus.

461
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,400
This house is trying to kill me.

462
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,520
Okay, don't walk into that.

463
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:56,960
Ah!

464
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:58,640
Should I?

465
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,440
I'm going to save.

466
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,320
Because I feel like I'm going to die.

467
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,160
Can I?

468
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,320
Can I help myself?

469
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:09,800
Can I?

470
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,400
What the hell?

471
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,840
That bed is floating.

472
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,520
Excuse me?

473
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,520
Why is it in French?

474
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,480
Ooh.

475
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:31,960
It's the pen that...

476
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,280
Oh.

477
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,320
That bed is floating.

478
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,360
Can I?

479
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,560
How do I get down?

480
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,280
Ooh, is a pretty boat in the distance.

481
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,320
Do I just jump down?

482
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,520
Am I going to kill myself?

483
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,840
All right, time to go see Therese.

484
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,200
Can this door open any fucking slower?

485
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,720
Lovely.

486
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,400
Whoa!

487
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,840
Oh, I'm fine.

488
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,400
It's okay.

489
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,440
I survived that.

490
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,200
Where the f...

491
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,440
Where the fuck am I supposed to go?

492
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,520
Can I jump?

493
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,160
Okay, there's fire there.

494
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,080
So that's not it.

495
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:28,880
Oh, here we go.

496
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,320
There we go.

497
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:30,720
Whoa.

498
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,960
Thank you very much.

499
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:39,440
Um, I think I can like kill the guy ghost.

500
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,120
Whoa, I just thought it was weird.

501
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,520
I feel like I'm missing something in here.

502
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,000
All right.

503
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,480
Um.

504
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,000
Later.

505
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,040
Wait, I feel like there's a way to like...

506
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:58,520
Isn't...

507
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:03,360
I feel like there's something I have to do to like release the spirits

508
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:08,240
from the bad stuff or maybe it's just giving the pendant.

509
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,520
This is the hotel branch location.

510
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,280
In the basement, you said?

511
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,440
Hmm.

512
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,000
Hold on.

513
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,360
Journal.

514
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,680
What do I do with the fucking thing?

515
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,240
How do I release her?

516
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,240
How do I release?

517
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,120
I'm looking this up.

518
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,440
I don't want no ghost to be left behind.

519
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:13,440
How to release ghost vampire the Magrae Bubwim.

520
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,440
Hmm.

521
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:41,640
Oh, okay.

522
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,240
That's right.

523
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,640
I I've played the game before.

524
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,640
I just couldn't remember how to do it.

525
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:04,440
All right.

526
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,440
Let's let's bounce as well as popsicle stand.

527
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,840
No ghost left behind exactly.

528
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,840
Wait, isn't this thing supposed to attack me?

529
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,840
I didn't do it.

530
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,440
Ooh.

531
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,840
Oh, wait, I think when you go in here, that's when it attacks you.

532
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,440
What's in here?

533
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,840
Nothing I can use.

534
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,840
It's a giant ass protractor.

535
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,440
Oh.

536
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,840
It didn't attack me.

537
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,040
Soundtrack is bomb.

538
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,840
Please let me get out of this hole.

539
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,840
Or last time I played this, I got stuck in the hole and I had to restart.

540
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,640
Kitchen has a journal.

541
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,840
No, yeah, I already grabbed the journal.

542
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:31,840
All right, time to go back and talk to my beloved Therese and my beloved Jeanette a.k.a. Azula.

543
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,840
I don't know how to get back up.

544
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,840
So I think it's going to go anywhere.

545
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,840
Secret bobcat boss fight.

546
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,840
I love how I creep.

547
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,840
I'm sorry.

548
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,840
All right, let me.

549
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,840
What the hell?

550
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,840
Oh, what the?

551
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,840
What am I doing?

552
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,840
I was like, where am I?

553
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:00,840
I got disoriented from the Fire Nation.

554
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,840
Yes, it's the same voice actress.

555
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,840
Oh, hold on.

556
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,840
Salvatore dance for monetization.

557
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,840
I don't know.

558
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,840
Oh, hold on.

559
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,840
Salvatore dance for monetization.

560
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,840
Come on.

561
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,840
The fuck?

562
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,840
There you go.

563
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,840
Dude, that would be a great alternative outfit that this girl has next to me.

564
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,840
Got a hair member dancing with me.

565
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,840
Oh, what is this shit?

566
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,840
Hey, big spender.

567
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,840
Yeah, I'm dancing with harem.

568
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,840
Let's go.

569
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,840
Mosh, mosh, mosh, mosh, mosh.

570
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:04,840
I'm dancing with Skrillex and some random girls.

571
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,840
Wait, did you have a tattoo on his back?

572
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,840
I've never even noticed that before.

573
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,840
Boomi, what are you doing?

574
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,840
Boomi, no.

575
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,840
Oh my God, dude, what the heck?

576
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,840
I'll break it over.

577
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,840
It's just a bug.

578
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,840
Don't even see it.

579
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,840
I need the soundtrack for this.

580
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,840
Female, I'll scream.

581
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,840
Okay, can I leave?

582
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,840
Okay, later.

583
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,840
Fuck you, I don't like you.

584
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,840
I'm gonna go to the girl upstairs.

585
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,840

I understand, but I still can't give it to you, baby girl.

Hmm, since you're so willing to rave that big spooky place for my darling sister, how about doing a teeny tiny favor for little trouble?

652
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:45,880

I was a tour door last time I played and but I had both the girl upstairs and her all over my jock

She's thinking about segregation I have no idea what's happening

821
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:11,640
Negative riz how can a woman deny me exacter exactly yeah, but I'm like a fancy bitch with my little stuff, you know

822
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:14,360
the little outfit

823
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:17,080
Jeanette

824
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:22,920
Hold on let me just look at how I should respond

825
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:33,640
Fuck

826
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:41,160
Fuck

827
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,280
And I swear

828
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,720
After all

829
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:55,160
Yeah, I have the item from Ocean House in a diary from there, too

830
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,560
Excellent, I'll take that

831
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:00,280
However, there's only one problem

832
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:05,080
It tongue gets word that I threatened Jeanette, which he most certainly already has

833
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:07,640
It's not likely he'll believe me

834
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:13,880
So in order to call off the feud you're going to have to convince Jeanette to forgive you just want to kiss her dead mouth

835
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:16,680
How do I do that?

836
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:22,760
We need some threats against my sister idle threats involving fire and her impious satin sheets

837
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:27,000
She took them quite seriously when I get to fuck the both of you, please

838
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:46,200
Yeah, and she also is a zula from our trial as airbender

839
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:48,680
We're all bubble bubble

840
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:54,600
With the Baron of Santa Monica wants her sister back I will get sister back

841
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:06,040
Tonger no tongue with tonger you kidding me, okay, I'll be honest with you. I feel like I'm gonna fucking vomit

842
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:11,800
I might have to end stream an hour early because I'm like

843
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:17,800
Feeling warm and hot and I know that's what my mic my migraine is really bad and I'm motion sick and I'm like sweating

844
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,800
So I'm gonna get off for now and go lay down

845
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:23,240
Maybe I'll come back. Maybe I won't um

846
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:27,800
I'm gonna read into one of the girls because I know there's a couple of the girls streaming right now

847
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:30,680
Whoo, I'm dizzy

848
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:36,440
I like how my fucking character is shaking Jesus Christ. No, I don't want to see that, please

849
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:39,320
That's gonna make me vomit even more

850
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:42,280
Okay

851
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:48,840
Thank you guys for understanding

852
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:56,840
