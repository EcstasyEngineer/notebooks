1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:50,800
Oh my God! Hi, Haram! How's it going? Ignore my floating head. Don't worry about that,

2
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:57,600
sweetheart, okay? Are my goffs here? My goffs better be here. Thanks for watching. It's

3
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:06,080
your girl, Shibony, Darkness, Dementia, Raven, Cotton, Bumway. Today we're going to be starting

4
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:17,840
chapter 16 of My Immortal. I have it all nice and cute up for you. Yes, I'm a Dull Han. If you

5
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:30,080
don't know, I'm a distant friend of Shibi, but my name is Shibony. I am not a rabbit. I'm a Dull Han,

6
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:39,680
and I am your favorite goth punk princess who loves MCR. And I have a gun, but don't worry about

7
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:55,040
that. That'll come up later. But how are you guys doing? I'm emo. Yeah, I hate my life. I hate it so

8
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:03,920
much. The only thing that keeps me going is my dedicated fans, my harlots, my Haram,

9
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:17,920
a punk haircut. You'll what, my what? You also love, I said MCR, not NCR. This is not fallout.

10
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,680
Hey, that's us. That's you put in pop. Wait, what? I probably shouldn't have used that word.

11
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:35,200
Yikes. Voldemort gave me a gun. He did. Voldemort did give me a gun.

12
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:43,440
Oh, yeah, go back to work. Yeah, if you got to work, totally understand. If you need to sleep,

13
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:51,520
go to sleep. If you need to read your Bible passages, read your Bible passages. So, yes,

14
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:59,600
you can have me in the background. You can just totally zone me out. I love my lurkers.

15
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,680
I love my chatters. We all we all here.

16
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,840
Put in pop is like an off brand Harley Quinn. Yeah, let's let's pretend that's what that meant.

17
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:21,440
I'm already starting off strong, she be already I mean, shibony.

18
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,720
Okay, okay, okay. Wait, why am I my face in the wrong direction? There we go.

19
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,920
Yeah, we are about to read the Bible. How's that monetization going?

20
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:45,920
Um, I'm monetized. Or do you mean like my personal channel like shibonies chant shibonies channel

21
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:53,200
I can even pronounce my own name. I like taking over she bees channel so like totally don't worry

22
00:04:53,200 --> 00:05:00,320
about that. But yeah, you can always catch up and watch part two and the VOD it was lots of fun.

23
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:08,960
So so far, if you don't know if you're first, if you're just tuning in now to the amazingness

24
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:15,600
that is my immortal. So my immortal is a fan fiction commonly believed to be satire, but I'm

25
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:23,280
the author just so you know, I'm claiming that title. It is a fan fiction of Harry Potter with a

26
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:33,200
self insert. My personal OC, ebony dementia darkness way. Yes, dementia. That's what I said.

27
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:43,520
This is my favorite piece of any sort of fiction. I mean, nonfiction ever written,

28
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,840
by the way, and I wrote it. So of course, you know, it's good.

29
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:54,720
Um, and it's about ebony, and she goes to Hogwarts, and she's in love with Draco. By the way,

30
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,800
everybody's goth. So preps get out like if you're a prep, if you're wearing Amber Convery and Fitch

31
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:09,200
right now, get the fuck out. We don't like you here. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Well, except if you

32
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,600
see on excites high school second place, I've never read Sonic High School, maybe I'll read that one

33
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:25,040
next. And then I'll dress up as a Sonic character. Oh, God. Oh, no. Um, no preps, no preps allowed.

34
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:34,480
Preps. Preps can go kiss your sister, you know, in Minecraft.

35
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,960
And my late how do you mean don't worry, we just started sugar tits. We're good. Don't

36
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,200
worry about it. You guys like my little meme. I mean, did you look guys like the meme that she

37
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:51,680
be made on her Twitter? From what I heard, it took her like an hour to put that together.

38
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,160
But she's very proud of herself.

39
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:04,560
Emo's only goffs only. So everybody take out your razor.

40
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:22,000
Everybody take out your blood and your your chokers, specifically my hands, my hands will

41
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:30,320
make a great necklace for you, by the way. And we'll we'll get into it. So where we left off

42
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:42,560
is that so Ebony just found out that possibly Draco and vampire aka Harry Potter are together

43
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,480
or were together and they're about to go to a concert. Can I make make this bigger?

44
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:54,880
My wings are in the way, but you guys don't need to read. There's some people that I don't

45
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:59,600
want to accidentally like show their face out of respect. So I'm covering them with my emote.

46
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:09,440
I mean, she visa emote. Let me let me switch the music. Let's see if this gets copyrighted.

47
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,840
The other time it did, but this said it was copyright free.

48
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:23,120
Is that too loud? Is it is it too loud?

49
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:33,440
Guys, tell me when do you get your own emotes? I don't know. I don't know if I'll ever get my

50
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:42,720
emotes. It's good. Okay. I'm gonna a little quieter. Do you like this spooky ambiance? Is that good?

51
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:52,560
I think that's fine. Also, I wanted to say thank you for you guys for your support lately.

52
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:01,120
Why is why did you just move up? Why the fuck? Why are you guys talking so much? Oh wait,

53
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,880
it's because I made this bigger. I'm actually stupid. Don't worry about it. It's small again.

54
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:14,480
Anyways, they actually have their own faces of profile. No, it's not that. It's just like it's

55
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,920
who the because this is like archived. It's not like on fanfiction.net, but it's easier for me to

56
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:25,120
read. There's also like cliff notes or like footnotes of like what she's trying to say.

57
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:34,320
I mean, what I'm trying to say. Because I tend to misspell things a lot. So it is what it is,

58
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:40,080
you know. Do we have anything gothic? What do you mean? We're reading stuff gothic right now.

59
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,560
But yeah, we're about to go to an MCR concert. Oh no, just kidding. We're about to go to a good

60
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:53,040
Charlotte concert. Wait, just kidding. I think good Charlotte and MCR there. So I think we're

61
00:09:53,680 --> 00:10:00,400
we're just having a great time. I can't remember any of the voices that I did except that Ebony

62
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:10,560
is a Valley girl. So I will do that. Let me just but what I was just gonna say, thank you for people

63
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:18,720
supporting me. Somebody bought me I am the internal ear monitor thingies off throne and I thank you so

64
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,000
much because I can't I'm realizing that you really can't wear over the ear headphones. They're just

65
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,200
not it's hurting my ears, especially when I wear my glasses. Because yes, I'm wearing glasses right

66
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:36,560
now. How does that make you feel? It's because I'm fucking blind. I just I don't know what to tell you.

67
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,720
Vampires goofy. Okay, Draco was mommy. Vampires goofy.

68
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:49,200
Copyright free gothic ambient ambient music. It's called trick or treat Halloween slash

69
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:56,640
autumn lo-fi no copyright playlist. I like when I nod my head.

70
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,640
Also this like hoodie doesn't have a back in it. It's usually just like see through. So I stuck

71
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:10,640
like ornaments behind me from YouTube studio. So it looks like it's the behind the hood.

72
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,680
Wait, can I put on glasses? If I put on glasses, I don't think

73
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,480
they won't pin because my head is technically an asset right now.

74
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:39,920
It'll just be like, oh my god, why do I look so fucking cute? Hello?

75
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:48,240
Hi, hi, it's me, Shibani, Darkness, dementia, cotton bomb way.

76
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,080
How does this make you feel? Do you think I look cute? Do you think I hold on to make them bigger?

77
00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:00,240
Do you think am I your am I the emo girl of your dreams? I better be the emo girl of your dreams

78
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:06,160
if I'm not. Your wrists are going to be covered in ketchup. That's all I'm going to say.

79
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:17,200
Nerd goth. Shibi nerd goth. I mean, yeah, imagine Shibi copied my style. That'd be crazy.

80
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,160
Bigger? Okay. All right, I think we're good.

81
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:33,520
I can't pin up so I moved six of the models, sadly. So it is what it is. Shibi would never.

82
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:40,000
I look so comically. Isn't there like a cartoon character that has like comically big glasses

83
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:47,360
like this? Who the fuck is Takane Louis? I think I'm cultured. I'm not.

84
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,360
When did Shibi go goth? I'm not Shibi. I'm Shibani.

85
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:59,760
How many times do I have to say my damn name? I'm Shibani, Darkness, Dementia, Raven, Cotton,

86
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,560
Bumway. God damn it. I mean, Satan damn it.

87
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,720
All right. But I hope you guys are ready. I'm gonna, this is actually, I think I might keep the

88
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,920
glasses on. Glasses are no glasses. You want glasses or no glasses? What do you think?

89
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,440
They won't be able to move properly. They'll just kind of be hanging out, but it is what

90
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:34,000
it is. Glasses? Okay. Okay. I'll keep the glasses on. We're very studious, you know, very studious.

91
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,560
Let me just adjust those glasses. Hello. These actually look like the glasses that I'm wearing,

92
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,880
except my frames are bigger and they're black, but I think I might get red glasses just to

93
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:51,440
not be cute. I'm never, it's not a phase, mom. It's a lifestyle. Okay. Get it, get it, get it

94
00:13:51,440 --> 00:14:00,880
together. All right. Where is, what did I do with the window? Okay, there it is. Are you ready,

95
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:07,520
everybody? So I got some chips, chips and gold fishies, and they got some apple juice.

96
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:15,600
Um, um, um, um, um, um. That person over there has a border.

97
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,360
Make sure,

98
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:31,600
make sure you guys are comfy, cozy.

99
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,360
I have the tweet that I'm live.

100
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,560
This is nice. This is nice. Thank you for the reminder.

101
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:01,120
Oh my God, I'm almost close to 10K on my main. That's just so weird to me. Why are people like me? I

102
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:14,240
don't, you like this? You like what you see right now? Why? Why are you? Stop. I expected it to be like,

103
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:20,080
there's too many people. I'm getting overwhelmed. Okay, hold on.

104
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,800
I think, yeah, let's have the Dono Alerts turned on so you guys can

105
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,200
don't know and text to speech to your, to your heart's content.

106
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,920
What the fuck am I doing? Oh yeah, I'm live. I'm tweeting that I'm live.

107
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:57,440
I am streaming this right now. If you want to come watch silly voices, I need a burp. Um,

108
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:09,600
then my nose is itchy. Then get here right now, please.

109
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:21,520
Where is, I can't, where am I? Where am I? Where am I? Oh my God. Why does it never remember what

110
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:28,240
emojis I use when I'm on my PC? Because I hate having to scroll all the way to look for that one

111
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:51,440
red button looking emoji. Okay, we're good. And then I just need to retweet

112
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:59,040
that on my sexy account because everybody pays attention to that one more. But that's fine. It's

113
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:17,360
okay. All right. Real fans have noticed for JB's tweets. Make sure to spam that like button,

114
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:23,920
hit subscribe, ding that bell, ding my bell, all ring yours. Let's start. Okay.

115
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:30,000
Chapter 16. I'm not going to read the author's notes because they're kind of redundant.

116
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:39,360
We ran happily to Hogsmeade. There we saw the stage where GC had played. We ran in happily.

117
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,480
MCR playing Helena. I was so fucking happy. Gerard looked even sexier than he did in the pictures.

118
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,920
Even Draco thought so. I could totally see him getting an erection, but it didn't matter because

119
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:57,680
I knew we were only the true ones for each other. I was wearing a black leather mini dress and black

120
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:04,240
leather platinum boots with red ripped fishnets. Draco was wearing a black baggy MCR t-shirt and

121
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:10,000
black baggy pants. Anyway, we started mashing to Helena. We fringed. We ran up to the front of the

122
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,800
band to stage dive. Suddenly Gerard pulled off his mask. So did the others. We gasped. It wasn't

123
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:29,280
them at all. It was comma ellipses. Those some more into death dealers. What the fuck, Draco? I'm

124
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:36,080
not going to a concert with yo. I shouted angrily. Not after what happened to me last time. Wait,

125
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,960
we're already at the concert. Even if it's MCR and you know how much I licked them.

126
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:49,440
What? Cause we, you know, he got get it uncomfortably because guys don't like to talk about you know

127
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:57,440
what? Yeah, cause we, you know, I yielded in an angry voice. We won't do that again. Draco promised.

128
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,880
This time we're going with an escort. It's a Zara.

129
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,840
Hello, hello, everybody just coming in. We just started. So we haven't missed much.

130
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:23,840
Oh, MFG WTF. Are you giving in to the mainstream? I asked. So I guess you're a prep or a Christina

131
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:30,560
or what now? No, he muttered loudly. Are you becoming a prepper? What? I shooted

132
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,840
angrily. Don't worry. I'll put my gun at some point.

133
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,640
And no, I'm not. Please come with me. He fell down to his knees and started singing

134
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:47,280
the world is black by GC to me. I was flattened because that's not even a single. He had memorized

135
00:19:47,280 --> 00:20:00,000
the lyrics just for me. Scroll down. Okay, then I guess I will have to. I said, and then we Frenched

136
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,720
for a while and then I went up to my room. I'm confused. I thought we were at the concert,

137
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,280
but I guess not. Maybe it was a dream. Bloody Mary was standing there.

138
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,760
Oh wait, this is Japanese. Not a Christina. I think they're like, she's talking about Christina

139
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:21,840
Aguilera. Well, let me, let me put up my feets. Put up one. Yeah, now I'm confused.

140
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,160
Okay, I'll guess I'll give her a kawaii weeaboo voice.

141
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:38,240
Hajime Masi did that. I can't read Japanese for shit. Hajime Masi did. Girl. She said happily.

142
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,680
She speaks Japanese. So do I. That means how do you do in Japanese? Wait, Hajime,

143
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,920
Hajime Masi. I don't, I don't feel like she's spelled that right.

144
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:59,680
By the way, Willow the fucking poser got expelled. Yo, what happened to Willow? Willow was my IRL

145
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:07,680
friends. I mean, yes, I said me. She filed all her classes looks like author had a falling out

146
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:12,880
of their best friend that she also inserted. And she's skipped math. Offers note. Raven,

147
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:22,160
you fucking suck. Fuck you. It serves that fucking batch of riot. I laughed angrily.

148
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:29,760
Well, anyway, we were feeling all depressed. We watched some gothic movies like Das Nightmare

149
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:35,600
before Chris X mess. Maybe Willow will die too. Jesus Christ.

150
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,880
That's not what that means. Yeah, I'm like, I don't think that's what that means either.

151
00:21:44,880 --> 00:22:12,960
Oh, yeah. I have a confession after she got expelled. I murdered her and then Lupin did

152
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,920
it with her because he's on the field with a neck fillack.

153
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:26,320
Kawaii. I comment happily. We talked to each other in silence.

154
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,440
For the rest of the movie. How do you talk in silence?

155
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:46,480
Okay. Oh, hey, BTW BT dubs actually is what I'm gonna say BT dubs. I'm going to a concert

156
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:53,920
with Draco tonight in Hogsmeade with MCR. I said I need to wear like the hottest hot set outfit ever.

157
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:00,560
Bloody Mary knotted energetically. Oh my fucking God, totally. Let's go shopping.

158
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:07,280
And hot topic, right? I asked already getting out my special hot topic loyalty card.

159
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:18,000
No, my head snaped up. What? My head spun spoon. I cannot believe it. Bloody Mary, are you a prep?

160
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:27,360
She laughed. I found some really cool gothic stores near Hogwarts. That's all.

161
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:34,560
Oh, who told you about them? I asked. Sure. It would be would be Draco and Diabolo or

162
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:45,280
Vampire. Don't even say that nom to me. Nom. PTSD or or me. Dumbly door, she said.

163
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:50,000
Let me sorry. Dumbly door. She said, let me just call our Brahms.

164
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:58,320
Oh, M F F G. Dumbly door. Wait. Sorry. Oh, M F F G. Dumbly door. I asked quietly.

165
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:04,560
Yeah, I saw the map for Hogsmeade on his desk. She sold she told me. Come on, let's go.

166
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,240
We are going to a few punk golf stores, especially for the concerts in Hogsmeade.

167
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,360
The salesperson was OMG hotter than Geron, except not because that's impossible. And he gave me a few

168
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:24,080
dresses. Wait, what voice should I think this is supposed to be Tom Riddle? Um, what voice?

169
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,120
What voice should Tom Riddle?

170
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,600
Prep is starting to sound like a slur. Bloody Mary.

171
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,160
Yeah, they know ASL. We're just speaking in sign language when they're talking quietly.

172
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,160
When they're talking in silence.

173
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:59,120
I think because isn't Tom Riddle played by like, who is it? Robert Pattinson. So I do like a British

174
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:12,960
accent. I'll do that. Let me finish chewing my chippies. No, it's not going to be Road Man.

175
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,160
No, not Reddler.

176
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,960
Edward voice. I'm going to do my best. Edward, call an expert and press him.

177
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,080
Hello. Hello. Welcome in. Okay.

178
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,360
We only have these for the real golfs.

179
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:43,200
Double golfs. Me and Bloody Mary ass.

180
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,520
Yeah, you wouldn't believe how many poses there on this town, man.

181
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,640
Yesterday, Lupin and Snap tried to buy a golfer camera pouch. He shook his head.

182
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,480
I didn't even know they had a camera.

183
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,200
Okay, he sounds Road Man anyways. We'll just keep it like that.

184
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:07,280
Oh, MFG. No, they're gonna spy on me again. I cried running out of the changing room wearing

185
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:11,280
a long black dress with lots of red tool coming on very low cut huge slit.

186
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:18,000
Oh, my Satan, you have to buy that outfit. The salesperson said.

187
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,120
Yeah, it looks totally hot. Said Bloody Mary.

188
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,480
You know what? I'm going to give it to you for free because you look really hot in that

189
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,240
outfit. Hey, are you going to be at the concert tonight? He asked.

190
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:36,080
Yeah, I'm actually, you guys can't see, but I'm tucking my, my hair behind my ear, like,

191
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:42,640
like, you know, you know what I'm doing. Yeah, I am actually, I looked back at him.

192
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:49,200
Hey, BT dubs, my name's Ebandi, the darkness dementia tarot way.

193
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,840
I don't know why I added a name in there, but you know, you get it.

194
00:26:54,560 --> 00:27:01,200
What's yours? Tom Rid, he said, and run a hand through his, his black dyed hair.

195
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,960
Maybe I'll see you there tonight.

196
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,520
The gopher is, I got dark gopher is.

197
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:17,040
Yeah, I don't think so because I'm going there with my BF, Draco, you sick perv.

198
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,400
I yelled angrily, but before he could beg me to go with him,

199
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,360
Hagrid flew in in this black broom looking worried. Wait, what was Hagrid's voice?

200
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:30,320
I think Hagrid had a fucking high pitch voice too. Oh fuck.

201
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,560
Was he a cowboy? No, that was Dumbledore. Dumbledore was the cowboy.

202
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:49,920
Oh my God, Abundi, I need to get back to the castle now.

203
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,640
Oh my God, Abundi.

204
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:08,960
Okay, okay, okay. Oh, sorry. Let me just cover your face. Fuck, sorry, Janice.

205
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,040
Yeah, I'm not doing Hagrid's voice.

206
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:23,760
Who is Scottish? I don't remember. I don't remember. Someone was Scottish and I don't remember who it was.

207
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:31,440
I live in Spain without the S. J.K. Rowling has written it enough already. It's up here for this one.

208
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:40,560
Okay, Tom, wait, hold on. Let me like move my glasses over because there's like a little bit.

209
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:48,560
I'm reading. There we go. And then I won't move my head as I read this next passage.

210
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:58,640
Tom Riddle gave us some clothes and stuff for free. He said he would help us with makeup

211
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:05,360
if he wanted because he was really into fashion and stuff. He's bisexual. Hagrid kept shooting at

212
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:12,880
us to come back to Hogwarts. WTF, Hagrid. I said angrily. Fuck off you fujacking bastard.

213
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:17,440
Well, anyway, Willow came. Hagrid went away angrily.

214
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:25,360
Hey bitch, you look kawaii. She said, yeah, but not as kawaii as yo. I answered sadly because Willow's

215
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:34,880
really pretty in everything. Oh wait, did they make up? Okay. Hell yeah. She's, they made up. It's good.

216
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,160
Oh my, oh my God, he was bisexual.

217
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,200
My scheduled guys are so hot.

218
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:53,120
She was wearing a short black corset thingy with bloodlet lace on it and a black or blood red

219
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:58,720
miniskirt, leather fishnets and black pointy pointy boots that showed up how pale she was.

220
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:04,400
She had a really nice body with big bobs and everything. She was thin enough to be in a

221
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:09,360
rexic. So what's she like?

222
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:19,600
So are you going to the concert with Draco? She asked. Yeah, I said happily. I'm going with

223
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:27,920
Diabolo. She answered happily. Well, anyway, Draco and Diabolo came. Diabolo, Diabolo, Diabolo.

224
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,560
I don't know. Let's do some bloat.

225
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:38,640
They were both looking extremely hot and sexy and you could tell they thought we were ought to.

226
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,680
What's ought to?

227
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:53,920
Big Bob's intersex. She got the nomi from one piece, Bonnie. Oh no, not the nomi. She got nomi.

228
00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:04,080
Diabolo was wearing a black t-shirt that said 666 on it. He is wearing tons off makeup just

229
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:09,360
like Marilyn Manson. Draco was wearing black leather pants, a gothic black GC t-shirt and

230
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:17,040
black vans he got from the Warped Tower. Bloody Mart was going to the concert with Dracola.

231
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:23,920
Dracola used to be called Navel, but it turned out that he was getting after birth in his real

232
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:32,640
family who were vampires. They died. Died as in D-Y-E-D, by the way, not...

233
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,000
Shut up. Shut up, guys. Don't read my burp. Don't read my burp.

234
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:45,840
Navel converted to Satanism and he went goth. He was in Slytherin now.

235
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:52,560
He was wearing a black warped t-shirt, black jeans, and shoes with black hair with red streaks

236
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:58,240
in it. We call him Dracula now. Well, anyways, we all went to Draco's Black Mercy Benz,

237
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:04,800
get it? Cause we're go- gopific. That his dad, Lucian, gave him. We did pot, coke, and crack.

238
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:13,680
Draco and I made out. We made fun of those stupid fucking preps. We soon got there. I gasped.

239
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:25,280
Not the Navel. Average day. Yeah, it's just, you know, day in my life, ma'am. Day in my life.

240
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:35,040
I need some good chips.

241
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,400
Let me some cattle-cooked chips.

242
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,320
Yeah, they did hot pot, Coca-Cola, and crack.

243
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,400
A little bit of crunching ASMR for you.

244
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,720
Crazy meal set.

245
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,440
Minds me, I forgot to eat today again.

246
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,840
I'm just living off of chips and goldfish for a day. Okay.

247
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,040
Okay.

248
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:30,720
Gerard was the sexiest guy ever. He looked even sexier than he did in pics.

249
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:36,240
He had long, red and black hair, embarrassing blue eyes. He was really skinny and he had an

250
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:47,200
amazing ethnic voice. Uh, what is ethnic? What's an ethnic voice?

251
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:54,640
We marched to Helena and some other songs. Suddenly Gerard pulled off his mask and so did

252
00:33:54,640 --> 00:34:01,600
it. Wait a second. Did she, oh, she must have like written the first part before in the last

253
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:11,680
chapter, but then decided she wanted to add more exposition. I gasped. It wasn't Gerard at all.

254
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:16,240
It was an ugly, preppy man with no nose and red eyes. It was,

255
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:28,080
I was, I was, I almost threw shade. I was not even like through shade, like in a mean way,

256
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:32,240
but I'm like, it'd be funny if I like rewrote this thing with actual VTubers names.

257
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:45,520
Oh, okay. Everyone ran away about me and Draco. Draco and I came. It was Voldemort and the death

258
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:52,000
dealers. I need to breathe.

259
00:34:55,360 --> 00:35:02,640
You moronic idiots. He's shooting angstily. And Obi, I told you to kill vampire,

260
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:11,040
thou have failed, and now I shall kill thou and Draco. No, please, we beg sadly, but he took out his knife.

261
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:21,280
Hello, hello. Bealer goes to Hogwarts? Oh no.

262
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,720
My gosh. Strawberry pop tart. Why would you stick, why would you stick a pop tart in the

263
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:40,320
microwave? You're crazy. I forgot how dumbly word, dumb, I almost said dumbly door. Dumbly worded

264
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:45,440
this thick was. Should have been spilt knife. I know she spilt knife, right? I'm very impressed.

265
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:53,760
Suddenly a gothic old man flew as in the sickness on his brimstick. He had lung as in the organ,

266
00:35:53,760 --> 00:36:02,720
black hair and a long black bread. He was wearing a black robe that said Abra Levine on the back.

267
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:10,720
He shot to the spell and Voldemort ran away. It was dumbly door. I don't know why I'm getting an

268
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:18,960
accent when I'm doing this. Sorry, Jacob, we're cutting your face off, Jacob. I'm sorry, bro.

269
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:24,960
There we go. No, your chin is showing. You cannot be seen. Be gone, Jacob.

270
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,960
He burnt his bread, just like Azura.

271
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,840
I woke up, done that, wait.

272
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:48,880
Did I just fall asleep? I don't. Anyways, I woke up the next day in my coffin. I walked

273
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:59,200
out of it and put on some black eyeliner, black eyeshadow, black eyeshadow, blood,

274
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:04,160
blood, bed or lipstick and black really low cut leather dress that was all ripped and in

275
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:09,760
stripes so you could see my belly. I was wearing a skull belly ring with black and red diamonds

276
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,000
inside of it. That's pretty hot. I'm not going to lie. A reference persona.

277
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,960
The night before, Draco and I rent back to the skull, get it skull because I'm

278
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:26,800
gothic and I like death. Dumbledore chased Voldemort away. We flew there on our brooms.

279
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:33,920
Mine was black and the broom stuff was blood red. The broom stuff. There was lace all over it.

280
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:40,240
Draco had a black MCR boom. We went back to our rooms and we had a, you know what,

281
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,840
to a Lincoln Park song.

282
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:54,160
Well, anyway, I went down to the Great Hall. There was all the walls, sorry, there all the walls

283
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:59,520
were painted black and the tables were black too. But you could see that there was pink

284
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:06,640
pants underneath the black pants and there was pastors of poser bands everywhere like Ashley

285
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:12,800
Simpson and the Backstreet Boys. They danced. Yeah, they totally, they danced.

286
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,200
My room is plastic and I bought a new Walmart.

287
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:28,560
WTF, I shouted, going to sit next to Bloody Mary and Willow. Bloody Mary, here we fucking go,

288
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:33,760
was wearing a black leather mini with a good Charlotte T-shirt, black fishnets and black pointy

289
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:39,040
boots. Well, I was wearing a long gothic black dress with blood red riding. That was all lacy

290
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:44,880
and came up to your thighs and black boots and fishnets. Vampire Dracula and Draco came.

291
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:52,400
Okay, totally unnecessary. We started to talk about who was sexier, Mikey or Gerard Way or

292
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:59,600
Billy Joe Armstrong. The boys joined in because they were bi. Those guys are so fucking hot.

293
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:05,120
Navel was saying a suddenly a gothic old man with a black beard and everything came.

294
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:11,600
He was the same one who had chased Voldemort, away Voldemort yesterday. He had normal tan skin,

295
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:19,280
but he was wearing white foundation and he had dyed his hair black, dyed as in dead and hair as in

296
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:30,000
like the rabbit. The old man came. My thighs, this is your thighs, up to your thighs, so I guess

297
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:41,440
you're wearing the so fit. Zombold door. Wheel gas. WTF, I shouted angrily. I thought he was just

298
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:49,200
wearing that to scare Voldemort. Hello, everyone. He said happily, as you can see, I gave the

299
00:39:49,200 --> 00:40:00,320
room a makeover. What do you think about it? Everyone from the poser table and Gryffindor

300
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:06,000
started to cheer. Well, we got to just look at each other all disfusted and shook our heads.

301
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:15,040
We kind of believe you. What a poser he was. BT dubs. You can call me Albert. He called as we left

302
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:26,400
to our glasses. Why is it capitalized? What a fucking poser. Draco shouted angrily as we we

303
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:33,040
to transformation. We were holding hands. Vampire looked really jealous. I could see him crying

304
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:43,520
blood in a gothic way. Get it? Way like Gerard. Like Gerard. But I didn't say anything. I bet he's

305
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:51,920
having a midlife crisis. Well, I'm shouted. I was so fucking angry. I have to read the spelling

306
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:58,160
mistakes are what makes this. I don't I could not I couldn't go without it. You know, hold on,

307
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:06,800
let me fix my glasses. Perfect. It's because when I lean forward and lean back, it doesn't, doesn't

308
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:16,640
notice. Chippy break. How's everybody doing so far?

309
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:25,840
Are you guys surviving? Are you guys thriving?

310
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:35,680
You have questions? Okay, let's class raise your hand if you have a question.

311
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:47,280
Go on. Is mischief? No, he's not in the story.

312
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:57,840
I'm coming more gothic by the second good. Yes, you in the front. What's your question? I see you

313
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:06,720
raising your hand. You like my take on it. I'm glad.

314
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:20,800
What's going on? You don't need to know dying by a little of laughing. I just finished my second

315
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:30,960
tangerine. I'm so happy for you. How much more cringe would my immortal be if it were written

316
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:38,560
with brain rot? I feel like it wouldn't change. How old is the author of the time of writing this?

317
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:47,600
I think she was like 16. You're wondering if all of you alert girls are saline or Ravenclaw?

318
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:48,720
I can tell you.

319
00:42:52,160 --> 00:43:00,000
Here's my Hogwarts house headcanon. I am Gryffindor. Azura is Hufflepuff.

320
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:10,000
Amy is Slytherin. Icy is Hufflepuff. Strawny is Gryffindor.

321
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:16,480
And Mercy is Ravenclaw.

322
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,440
I was thinking because I don't think Strawny would be

323
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:38,240
in Slytherin.

324
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:55,040
No, but they do know who wrote this. It was Tara Gillesbee. She wrote it for satire.

325
00:43:55,360 --> 00:44:02,640
But just kidding. I actually wrote it. It was my real life account when I went to Hogwarts.

326
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:18,720
Anyone question? Who is Gerard? From the Witcher? You can picture him like that because that's kind

327
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:29,440
of hot. Like Henry Cavill Witcher or a video game Witcher. Either one would be golden. But no,

328
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:47,840
Gerard Way is the lead singer of MCR. My Chemical Romance. Gerald. I have the Witcher 1 and 2.

329
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:50,320
I thought I had the Wild Hunt. But I guess I don't.

330
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:03,440
Geralt. He'll be the hot teacher. He have intrusive thoughts about.

331
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:09,120
He doesn't even have to be a hot teacher. I would just have thoughts about him.

332
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:16,480
Geralt. Yes, Geralt. Gerald actually.

333
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,520
She be Witcher Marathon when? Like I was gonna like play in the games or like watching it.

334
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,960
Because I'll gladly watch it with you guys again. I like the the TV show.

335
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,840
On Netflix. What day is it today?

336
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,760
Hi, Siri. What day is it?

337
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:49,440
Oh, goodie. I have my members stream tomorrow. Or we get to watch the Master of Disguise together.

338
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,000
No, I haven't done anything. It'll be my first membership stream.

339
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,640
Yeah, we're gonna join the Turtle Club.

340
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:15,600
You're going to miss it. How dare you? Do I have to start being more possessive?

341
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:20,640
Am I being too nice? I'll be like, you guys better give me so much attention or I'm gonna die.

342
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:25,840
I'm like a plant. I'm gonna wither away and I'm gonna perish. If you don't tell me you love me right now.

343
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:40,720
Why do you guys have jobs? Jobs are to watch me. Give me attention and love and affection.

344
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:46,080
Because I'm lonely and I crave all the affection and attention in the world.

345
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:52,080
I tried to hold that one back and it didn't really work out for me.

346
00:46:52,400 --> 00:47:00,400
You love me? You love me? But your name's in gray. You're a fucking light-nosed.

347
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:15,920
Most stable VTB. I can go real manhara. I didn't get real yandere. You ain't seen nothing yet.

348
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:20,080
You ain't seen nothing. You ain't seen nothing. But no, no, I'm gonna be good.

349
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:26,800
I'm gonna be good because I'm a responsible little streamer and I am...

350
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:34,000
My marbles are in the jar. None of them. They've all been gathered.

351
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:42,480
Manhara. That sounds like it should be a segment.

352
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:53,920
That actually is a segment where I just... I don't even know what it would be about. So give me ideas.

353
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,840
I had to fill the jar with something.

354
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:11,920
I love my madam because madam loves us wrong. But I need to make money to spend on that.

355
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:18,400
Am I like a cat? I'm like a... I'm like an independent cat that just like roams your house

356
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:25,600
and I give you love and affection sometimes but on my terms. And then you just give me lots of treats

357
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:31,280
and you buy me lots of toys and cat trees and you just hope one day that I'll just be able to

358
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:35,920
speak and tell you how much I love you back but I never do because I'm a cat.

359
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:51,760
As someone who has two cats, this is already a reality. Perfectly explained, see?

360
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,080
Makes sense as why I was a cat in my past life.

361
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:04,480
Agon, she's here. She be scratching the door, you open, then you stare and you walk away.

362
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:09,040
Yeah, pretty much. I'm gonna sit on your desk while you're playing game and I'm gonna knock

363
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:16,240
your g-fuel, your gamer sups off your desk because I want your attention and pets.

364
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:24,160
You did own a cat once. What happened to it? Why? Why are you saying that so ominously?

365
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:31,840
That's what happens if we touch your belly. You know, I don't like belly rubs. It just...

366
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:40,240
I'm not feeling... You give me headpats, you can scratch my booty, but belly rubs.

367
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:44,800
I'm gonna have to use my claws on you, sport. I'm sorry, you know?

368
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,720
Some of those cats can bring a serious income.

369
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:56,480
I must be the only cat owner who's never had their cat knock shit off their desk,

370
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:02,160
actually, my cats don't really do that. I'm trying to...

371
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,800
They don't, yeah, they don't really knock things off my desk. So usually just like,

372
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,320
Boomi will just like pick it up in his mouth and just run away with it. He doesn't knock it off.

373
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:22,400
Stretch. Ignore my delahod head being contained by only...

374
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:31,760
Uh, what's it called? My hoodie, flying off into the distance.

375
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,480
I don't use a desk. Yeah, they just sit on the floor.

376
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,000
It's in me to face it. No, I'm kidding. I'm teasing you. I'm teasing you.

377
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:51,120
Oh, she's touching this. Okay, rest in peace. Good cat. I've had several cats.

378
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:57,200
Growing up. So I totally get it. I don't even know where my cats are right now.

379
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:00,080
I think Boomi's laying in his bed. I cleaned my house today.

380
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:06,000
The cats were terrified by the new vacuum. Boomi, I don't even...

381
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,760
Like Reina just sat on the couch and was chilling and she was just watching it because she's

382
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:15,440
keeping an eye. And then Fia was hiding under the bed. Now that she can do that, there's a little

383
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:22,000
spot in the cat stairs. It's like a bed. And so she like goes inside the cat stairs and then

384
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:28,240
just like sleeps in there and hangs out when she's chilling. And then Boomi was just walking around

385
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:35,280
with his... The hair on his back bristled in fright with this little... The base of his tail poofy.

386
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:41,280
And then just like... But then like wouldn't walk away from the vacuum. And I'm like, dude,

387
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:46,640
if you're scared of it, just like, why are you keep like... You're just staring at it. I'm like,

388
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:50,960
are you like someone who likes to watch like horror movies because you like the adrenaline it gives

389
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:56,400
you? Like you have every... Like your fight or flight is non-existent. Like the cat. I don't even...

390
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:03,200
Boomi is just a dork. He climbed into my fridge for the like 50th time today. Boomi likes to chill

391
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:10,640
out in my fridge. I don't know why he does. It's not like he's hot. He just likes to go in there.

392
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:19,360
I took a picture of him in my empty fridge because I went to go get some juice and I left it open

393
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:27,440
for a second. And then he... It's a cool vibe. He just wanted to vibe in the fridge. And he...

394
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:33,280
I can't really explain it. But you know how there's like a little like side... Like when you open the

395
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:38,240
doors, there's usually like in the doors, you can like put like condiments and stuff. And usually

396
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:45,680
like in the bottom, there's like a place where you can stick like a juice or like a water thing.

397
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:55,600
So I like... Mind you, I couldn't... So I was like half closed. So like one door was open, one was

398
00:52:55,600 --> 00:53:00,480
closed. And I go to close the other one and I see Boomi's head sticking out. And I'm like,

399
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:04,960
dude, what are you doing? So I open the door so I can get him out. And he's just sitting in the bottom

400
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:13,120
thing. And then so he just like slowly comes out of the fridge, but like sitting in the shelf

401
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:20,560
from the fridge. And I was just losing it because it was just so funny how he just slowly was like,

402
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:27,600
I'm in the bottom. I will post a picture. I took a picture of it, but you guys can't bully me.

403
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:31,120
He wants some sauce from the fridge. Hey, shut up.

404
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:38,080
I don't know why he gets in there because then I have to wipe it every time he gets in there

405
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:42,160
because it was... I don't want his dirty paws in my fridge, you know, my refrigerator.

406
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,080
I'm the sauce lady. I come out and I throw sauce everywhere.

407
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:55,920
All right, let's continue. Hope everybody enjoyed that break. Let me move my glasses back.

408
00:53:55,920 --> 00:54:05,760
Make a comfort. All right.

409
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:32,880
I'm sorry. That was one of my favorite memes when Batman came out.

410
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:41,840
Anyways, why can't I get my glasses to work? Come on glasses.

411
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:49,280
Come on. Oh, fine. I'll put them like awkwardly like that.

412
00:54:49,280 --> 00:55:00,080
Why are they big? Let me make them smaller. Let me make them a little smaller.

413
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:12,400
I can't find... I can't find the window to the walls. My favorite version of that song.

414
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:14,000
Okay.

415
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:27,120
Next chapter. Chapter 19. The last thing you want in your Burger King break. Sorry. Anyways.

416
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:37,520
I'm not okay. I promise. I'm not okay. I promise.

417
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:48,480
All day, we sat angrily thinking about Dumbledore. We were so fucking pissed off.

418
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:55,680
Well, I had one thing to look forward to. The MCR concert. It had been post-phoned,

419
00:55:55,680 --> 00:56:03,280
so we could all go. MCR postponed their concert so that everybody from Hogwarts could go. That's

420
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:12,080
pretty sick. Jill's ASMR roleplay. Just joined. Can we get a recap of what we've read so far?

421
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:17,200
I've only read like three chapters because I get distracted easily and I like the app.

422
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:27,040
But so far, Ebony and Draco went to a MCR concert, but it wasn't really MCR. It was

423
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:35,120
Vulsamort and the Deaf Dealers. And then Dumbledore scared him away. And then Dumbledore is trying

424
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:40,960
to pretend that he's goth. And so he changed Hogwarts into a goth academy because he's a poser.

425
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:45,520
MCR is so pissed. Okay.

426
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:51,040
Where the fuck?

427
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:53,520
I lost my spot.

428
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:06,000
We were so fucking pissed off. We already said that. Anyway, I went to the common room sadly

429
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:13,280
to cut classes. Draco was being a little secretive. I asked what it was and he got all mad at me and

430
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:23,520
started crying all hot and angsty. Aren't sensitive by guys so hot. No one fucking understands me.

431
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:29,840
Oh wait, sorry. No one fucking understands me. He shouted angrily as his black hair went in

432
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:36,960
his big blue eyes like Billy Joel, Billy Joe, and Boulevard of Borkin Dreams.

433
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:48,640
I was wearing a black leather low cut top and chains all over it, all over it. A black leather

434
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:55,840
mini black high held boots and a cross belly thing. My hair was all up in a messy, really high

435
00:57:55,840 --> 00:58:00,880
bun like Amy Lee and gong under. Email me if you want to see the pic.

436
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:12,560
I'm gong under, gong under Billy Joe. My dreams are Borkin.

437
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,840
Accused me. What about me? I growled.

438
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:22,960
Oh no, my head.

439
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:35,600
Bye, butt, butt. He grunted. You fucking bastard. I moaned. No, wait, it's not what I'm fucking,

440
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:45,280
wait, no, wait, wait. No, wait, it's not what it fucking looks like. He shouted. Why?

441
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:51,360
He only said no one understands me. Why am I getting so upset?

442
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:57,680
But it's too late. I knew what I heard. I ran to the bathroom angrily, cring,

443
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:06,080
Draco banged on the door. I whipped and I whipped as my bloody eyeliner streamed down my cheeks

444
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:12,000
and made cool tears down my feces like Benji in the video for girls and boys.

445
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:17,760
Raven, that is so our video. I took out a cigarette and started to smoke pot.

446
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:30,960
I took out a cigarette and started to smoke pot.

447
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:39,600
I'm joking. Oh, okay.

448
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:47,840
Suddenly Hagrid came. Sorry, Hagrid came. He had a pirated.

449
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:57,760
You gave me a fucking shock. I shouted angrily, dropping my pot. What WTF you think you're doing

450
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:03,840
in the girls room? Only it wasn't just Hagrid. Someone else was with him too. For a second,

451
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:07,440
I wanted to be Tom Rid or Draco, but it was Dumbledore.

452
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:14,000
Hey, I need to ask you a question. He said pulling out his black wannabe

453
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,800
gothic purse. What are you wearing to the concert?

454
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:20,480
You know who MCR are?

455
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:31,600
I gasped. No, I just I can't maintain the accents. No, I just saw there was a concert

456
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:37,600
that a lot of goss and punks were going to. Yee-haw. He said, anyway, Draco has a surprise for you.

457
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,480
Is it his pee pee? I don't know.

458
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:56,640
You're at a cool concert. Your teacher shows up. Yee-haw. Everyone says to me Yee-haw, but nobody

459
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:57,680
says, oh, yee.

460
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:06,640
Anyway, chapter 20.

461
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:14,320
All day, I wondered what the surprise was. Meanwhile, I popped on a black letter mini,

462
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:21,520
a black corset with orbo lace stuff all over it, and black gothic compact boots.

463
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:29,680
MCR were going to the concert again, since Volxamort has taken over the last one.

464
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:36,560
I slipped my wrists while I moshed to MCR in my bedroom all night, feeling excited.

465
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:39,360
So wait, she's just like in her bedroom, you know,

466
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:46,080
using it, making ketchup packets, and then she just throws her body around her room.

467
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:51,200
Just moshing. Didn't Draco die? No, he didn't die. He just took out a knife,

468
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:55,280
and then I guess, and then Dumbledore just like showed up and didn't kill.

469
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:59,360
Yeah, and so he didn't die. Draco's alive. He's fine.

470
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:06,560
Dumbledore has his priorities straight. She sleeps in a dorm. Well, she has her own bedroom with Willow.

471
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:10,480
So it's her and her roommate Willow, okay?

472
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:23,760
Where did I lost my spot? I'm excited. Suddenly someone knocked on the door while I was trying

473
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:30,800
some black clothes and moshing to fang you for Da Venom. I got all mad in turn of, but scarredly,

474
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:40,960
sacredly, I hopped inside that it was Draco, so we could do it again.

475
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:46,320
What the fucking hell are you doing? I shouted angrily.

476
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:52,720
It was Lupin. Are you gonna call me? Or what? I yelled.

477
01:02:55,200 --> 01:03:02,480
Are you gonna share some grape juice with me or what? I yelled. I was allowed to say that

478
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:06,480
because Dumbledore had told us all to be careful around him and snap since he was a pedo.

479
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:16,480
No, actually. Get it, hell. Can I please borrow some condoms?

480
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:28,400
He growled angrily. Yeah, so you can fuck your six-year-old girlfriend? Huh? I said this

481
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:36,880
sarcastically. Fuck her, he said, gong away. Well, anyway, I put on some black eyeshadow.

482
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:44,480
That sounds bad. Black eyeliner and some black lipstick and white foundation. Then I went. Then

483
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:51,040
I gasped. Ellipses, ellipses, ellipses, ellipses, ellipses, ellipses, ellipses, ellipses. Snake

484
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:57,280
and Lupin were in the middle of the empty hall doing it and Dobby was watching.

485
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:07,760
Oh my god, you ludicrous idiot. They both

486
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:12,000
shooted angrily when they saw me. Dobby ran away crying.

487
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:27,040
They got up though. Normally I would have been turned on. I love seeing guys do it.

488
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:33,200
But both of them were fuking preps. By the way, Snake has moved to Gryffindor now.

489
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:41,120
Why does she hate Snape so much? You'd think he's like the ultimate goth icon in Harry Potter.

490
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:47,680
Why would you make Snake Snape a non-goth?

491
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:55,280
WTF? Is that why you wanted condoms? I asked sadistically. See, I spelled that.

492
01:04:55,680 --> 01:05:03,440
Yeah. She still doesn't. Only you wouldn't give them to me. Lumpkin shouted angrily.

493
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:13,520
While you should have told me, I replayed. You, you, damn it. Snake began to shoot angrily. And then

494
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:21,440
Ellipses, I took out my black camera and took a pic of them. You can see that they were naked and

495
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:28,480
everything. Well, excuse me. They both shouted angrily. What was that all about?

496
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:34,960
It was to blackmail you. I snarked. So now next time you see me doing it with my boyfriend,

497
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:39,760
you can't fuking rat me out. I'll show this to Dumbledork. So fuk off you bastards.

498
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:45,680
I started to run. They chased me, but I threw my wound at them and they tripped over.

499
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:53,440
Wait, so translation. She threw her wand and they just tripped. Two grown ass men managed

500
01:05:53,440 --> 01:06:06,800
to both trip over a like six inch wand. Well, anyway, I went outside and there was vampire

501
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:15,360
looking extremely fuking hot. WTF. Where'd Drake go? I asked him. My nose is itchy.

502
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:27,440
Could be packing a bigger wand. Yeah, maybe her, her wand is just thick. She got a thick

503
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:38,240
um's wand thicker than a snicker. Um, sorry, I just read the next line. Um, garsh. Oh,

504
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:46,560
he's being a fuking bastard. He told me you wouldn't come. Huh? Vampire said shaking his head.

505
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:49,200
You want to come me to the concert?

506
01:06:54,800 --> 01:07:03,760
Then he showed me his flying car. I gasped. It was a black car. He said his dogfather's.

507
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:14,240
Wait, is that like a joke because Serious Black is a werewolf? His dogfather?

508
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:18,880
Is that a thing in the books? I've never read the books or seen the movies really. So

509
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:30,480
um, has given it to him. The license plate on the front said MCR666 on it. The one on the back

510
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:39,440
said a no be on it. I gasped. We flew to the con. Like, okay, I just didn't say anything about it.

511
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:44,880
I just gasped. Where is everybody getting these vanity plates? You know, these vanity plates are

512
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:54,480
very expensive. Um, at least in America. We flew to the concert hall. MCR were there playing. Vampire

513
01:07:54,480 --> 01:08:00,160
and I began to make out, moshing to the music. Oh, so she just cheated on her fuking boyfriend.

514
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:03,280
What a bitch. Andy Arbrose are going to eat this shit up.

515
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:14,240
I gasped looking at the band. I almost had an orgasm. Geron was so fuking hot.

516
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:18,800
He began to sing Helena. And that's the only song she fuking knows by MCR. I swear to God.

517
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:25,360
And his sexy, beautiful voice began to fill the hall. Ellipses. And then I heard some crying.

518
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:31,120
I turned and saw Draco crying in a corner because he saw me cheating on her.

519
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:40,560
Oh, please. If somebody, did she be cotton bum for their license plate? Somehow I would,

520
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:45,600
I would, I would do a backflip. I'm not even joking. I'll do a backflip if that happens.

521
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:50,320
No, actually, no, I can't do a backflip, please. I haven't done a backflip for a long time

522
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:52,800
since gymnastics. Please, no.

523
01:08:57,040 --> 01:09:00,640
I was sitting in the cock corner. He was in the cock dirt, in the cock chair.

524
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:08,800
All right. Chapter 21. Is there a cat on my chair? I feel like I hear scratching.

525
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:13,840
No. Okay, I'm just making sure that my cat isn't like being like, hey, pick me up.

526
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:23,200
Oh, my head edges. She be CB. Well, you don't have to, you can make it, you know, different.

527
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:33,680
It could just put she be bum. But how do you backflip with your back problems? I don't know.

528
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:39,520
That's why I said never mind. I was like, my back hurts so bad while I was vacuuming. I'm like,

529
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:45,120
wow, I'm really, I'm really getting up there in age. I can't, when I hit 57, I'm probably just

530
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:55,600
going to explode. Later, we all went in the skull. Draco was in the common room. Draco, are you okay?

531
01:09:56,320 --> 01:10:02,560
I asked him, oh, sorry. Draco, are you okay? I asked him the gothic voice. I guess my gothic voice,

532
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:10,240
I guess. No, I'm not you fucking bitch. He shouted angrily. He stated to run out of the place in a

533
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:16,080
suicidal way. I shouldn't have said that word because of fucking YouTube and on the live and

534
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:24,560
Minecraft way. I stated to cry because I was afraid he would commit seppuku.

535
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:33,680
She cheated on her and she has something to ask. I know I'm like, dude, what's wrong? You only saw

536
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:43,680
me kissing your ex-boyfriend because this is a weird love triangle. Don't permit the suise doll.

537
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:48,880
That's actually pretty good, the suise doll.

538
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:52,000
Oh, okay.

539
01:10:55,280 --> 01:11:03,280
It's okay, you know me. Vampire said comfortably, I'll make him feel better.

540
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:12,960
You mean you'll go fuck him, won't you? I shouted, girl, you just kissed him in front of Draco. You

541
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:23,280
literally just cheated, you have no right to act this way. Oh my god.

542
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:32,480
Then I ran to get Draco. Vampire came too. Draco, please wait. Who's talking?

543
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:40,800
I'm just gonna say it as a nobody. Draco, please come. He began to cry. Tears of blood came down

544
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:48,080
as pale as in like a pale you put sand in face. I was so turned on because I love sensitive

545
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:57,600
by guys. If you're a homophobe, then fuck off. Yeah, I get so turned on watching men cry. Tears of blood.

546
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:08,400
And then ellipses, ellipses, ellipses, ellipses, ellipses, ellipses.

547
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:15,120
We heard, like heard as in like cows, by the way, some footsteps. Vampire got out his black

548
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:27,600
invincibility coke. Like, is it a drug or is it? Or is it the fucking? Or is it like a Coca-Cola?

549
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:37,520
Oh, I apologize if anybody donated. I have my, I don't mind wearing my headphones.

550
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:43,360
Um, wait, nobody told me that nothing, no music was playing.

551
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:50,800
Video, why is the video pause? Has it been up and playing this entire time?

552
01:12:55,040 --> 01:13:01,040
I'll just replay the same video. Let's go. Okay.

553
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:14,560
Okay. But thank you, BlackSilence26 for the tip from earlier. Here's a reward for cleaning your house.

554
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:17,040
Madame, thank you. Thank you.

555
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:26,320
I thought silence is for ambience and drama. I'm so folk. Okay, okay. That's good at least. That's good.

556
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:43,920
We both got under it. We saw the janitor, Mr. Norris there, shouting angrily with the flashlight in his hand.

557
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:53,520
He shouted angrily. We saw Filth come. He went under the invisibility cloak and started to meow loudly.

558
01:13:54,480 --> 01:14:01,920
Wait, is it Mrs. Norris, the cat? Does she just get the characters messed up?

559
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:06,560
I thought there was like a teacher that could turn into a cat. It was a cat's name, Filth.

560
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:12,640
Chuck Norris is here. She messes up the names. Okay.

561
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:14,720
Um,

562
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:16,720
Hey, shout out to you one day.

563
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:18,320
Y'all, Mr. Norris.

564
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:25,280
No, fuck you, you preppy little loser-poser son of a fucking bitch.

565
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:31,200
Y'all, vampire senator, is breast in a disgusted way.

566
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:41,440
Oh, that's a bit of a gongal. Okay. I don't fucking know. What is the cat called, Filth?

567
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:43,120
What is the cat called, Filth?

568
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:55,280
Um, excuse me, excuse me, who said that? Y'all, Mr. Norris, then he heard Filth meow.

569
01:14:56,320 --> 01:15:01,200
Filth, is there anyone under the cloak? Wait, he knows the cloak is there.

570
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:04,800
It was like, is anyone there? Is there just a random invisibility cloak?

571
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:10,480
Then nobody can be possibly under, although I heard something. Oh my gosh, hi, Reina.

572
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:17,280
Reina, what's up, girlie pop? You coming to snuggle? Oh my god, you're coming to snuggle with me?

573
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:26,880
Really? Oh my god, yes, queen. Thank you. Reina has joined the fray.

574
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:30,640
She is rubbing against the microphone.

575
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:38,400
She is rumbling. She's headbutting the mic. Her chest is wet because she must have just

576
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:41,040
decided to swim in her water bowl.

577
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:47,040
She's purring so well.

578
01:15:47,360 --> 01:16:07,120
All right, she's sitting on my shoulder now. Let's continue.

579
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:19,920
Filth nodded, and then ellipses, ellipses, ellipses. Vampir franched me.

580
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:23,920
He did it just as Mr. Norris was taking off the cloak.

581
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:30,720
What the? He yelled, but it was too late now because we were running away from him.

582
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:37,680
And then we saw Draco crying and busting into tears and slipping and making catch

583
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:46,960
of packets outside the school. Draco, I cried. Are you okay? I guessed. I guessed, though.

584
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:57,440
Draco wept. We went back to our coffins, frenching each other. Where the fuck did vampire go?

585
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:07,280
Draco and I decided to watch Lake Placid see isn't that depressing on the gothic red bed together

586
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:14,560
as I was about to put on the video in the video. What? What is happening? My eyes rolled up and

587
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:19,280
suddenly I had a vision of something that was happening. Now there was a knock on the door and

588
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:26,000
Fug and a mystery of magic walked into the school. Draco as in Soldier Boy? Sure.

589
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:35,360
Okay. Chapter 22.

590
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:47,840
Draco couldn't hold his edge in bust. Here's 44 chapters of this.

591
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:50,640
Um.

592
01:17:55,040 --> 01:18:01,040
All day, everyone talked about the misery of magic. Well, anyway, I woke up the next day.

593
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:08,560
I'm scared. I was in my coffin so I opened the door. I was wearing black lacy leather pajama.

594
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:14,080
Who wears leather pajamas to bed? Who does this? Then I gasped.

595
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:17,120
We're gonna do the gasped noise.

596
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:24,720
No. Okay. She's just gonna burn to the microphone.

597
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:32,080
Real gobs too. You're right. You're right. I'm gonna start wearing leather to bed.

598
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:36,640
I'll get some latex leather. Just be like only in bed like that.

599
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:46,480
Standing in front of me wear Bloody Mary, Vampire, Diabolo, Draco, Dracula and Willow.

600
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:53,600
I opened my crimson eyes. Wait, were they close? How did they know? Willow was. Oh, great. Here we go,

601
01:18:53,600 --> 01:19:00,480
everybody. Buckle in for the outfits. Willow was wearing, I'm saying this in my normal voice.

602
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:05,200
Willow was wearing a tight black leather top with pictures of bloody roses all over it.

603
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:10,960
Under that, she warped a black poofy skirt with lace on it and black gothic boots that was attached

604
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:20,080
to the top. What? Vampire was wearing a baggy simple plan t-shirt and baggy black pants and vans.

605
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:27,920
Draco was wearing a black MCR t-shirt and black... Why did a Windows thing just pop up? I don't care

606
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:37,360
about Windows 11. Remind, why did that just pop up randomly? Sorry. Windows had something to say.

607
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:45,280
Draco was wearing a black MCR t-shirt and black jeans and a leather jacket.

608
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:53,200
He looked just like a Gerard Way and almost as fucking sexy. Vampire looked like Joel Madden.

609
01:19:55,280 --> 01:20:01,440
Bloody Mary. I just thought of like, like, like e-sports. I mean, not e-sports, or just like,

610
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:10,880
um, what the fuck? Just like, one of the football games are just Madden. Yeah, just just Madden,

611
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:16,960
the game. Bloody Mary was wearing a tight black poofy gothic dress that she had ripped it,

612
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:23,040
so it showed all of her clerage with a white apron that said, bitch, mother swear words.

613
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:29,040
She's so, she's like essentially dressed like Alice the Madness, but then just has stuff written

614
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:35,440
all over her apron. Um, mother swear words and MCR lyrics on it kind of like, kind of like one

615
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:43,360
dress I had seen Amy Lee wear once. Darkness, who is Jenny, was there too. She was weaving a ripped

616
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:48,560
gothic black dress with ripped stuff all over an lace-up top thing in black pointy boots.

617
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:55,440
So were Crab and Goyle. It turns out that Darkness, Diabolo, Crab and Goyle's dad was a vampire.

618
01:20:55,440 --> 01:21:05,920
He committed, uh, Suisse doll by making ketchup with a razor. He had given them grape juice and

619
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:11,360
stuff before too. They all got so depressed that they became gothic and converted to stanism.

620
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:20,640
Not enough all thank you, yeah. Yeah, they became K-pop stans.

621
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:35,680
So basically everyone in Slytherin has the same backstory, essentially, yeah.

622
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:42,800
Oh, I'm FG. I yielded as I jumped up. Why the fuck are you all here?

623
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:50,640
And no be, wait, and no be something has really fucked up. Draco said, okay, but I need to put

624
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:59,040
on my fucking clothes first. I shouted angrily. It's all right. We have to go now and you look

625
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:04,880
kawaii anyway. You are so fucking beautiful. Draco said in a sexy voice.

626
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:13,520
Oh, all right. I said smiling, but you have to tell me why you're being all erective.

627
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:23,280
I will, I will, he said. So I didn't, Reyna, why are you, she's like in the weirdest position right

628
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:32,080
now. Reyna, why are you sitting like that? Okay. I brushed you this morning and you're shedding

629
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:44,080
so much. Let's do some brush ASMR. I literally vacuumed and there was so much hair. Oh, there's

630
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:53,520
now you're getting cozy. Oh, okay. Perfect. You just hang out just like that.

631
01:22:56,080 --> 01:23:01,920
She wants to listen. She was like, Reyna has this weird thing where she'll like

632
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:09,120
sit her butt on me, but then like stand up. Like, but it's like uneven. So like, okay, imagine you're

633
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:15,920
like on a stair and this cat is on a stair, but the butt is on the top stair and their feet are

634
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:20,960
just like standing on the bottom stair and she just like uses parts of me as like a little shelf to

635
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:28,560
put her ass on. So I just don't understand why she sits like that. She was doing that on one leg

636
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:34,000
to my other leg because my legs were uneven. But yeah, I hope that makes sense to you.

637
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:44,960
So I just put on some black eyeliner, black lipstick and black and red eyeshadow and white

638
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:54,240
foundation. Then I came. We all went in front of your friends. Come on, girl. There's a time and a

639
01:23:54,240 --> 01:24:01,200
place. We all went outside to the great hell and looked in from a widow, a fucking prep called Brittany.

640
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:07,680
This is supposed to be Brittany Spears, by the way, from Gryffindor. Brittany Spears is canonically

641
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:14,320
Gryffindor was standing next to us. She was wearing a pink mini and a Hillary Duff T-shirt. So we put

642
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:20,880
up our middle fingers at her inside the great hall. We could also see Dumbledork. Cornelia fudged

643
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:26,960
was there shouting at Dumbledore. Doris Rumbridge was there too. This could not be. She said it

644
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:34,080
angrily. The school must be closed. The barclaw is planning to kill the students yelled Cornelia fudge.

645
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:40,880
You are not fit to be principal any longer yelled Rumbridge. You are too old and your Alzheimer's

646
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:47,920
is dangerous. You must retry or Voldemort will kill your students. What the fudge?

647
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:56,240
Very well. Dumbledore said angrily. But we cannot do this. We cannot close the school. There is

648
01:24:56,240 --> 01:25:01,760
only one person who is capable of killing Voldemort and she is in the school. And her name is

649
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:12,160
Anoni Darkness Dementia Raven Way. Draco Crabgoyle Darkness Willow Vampire and Bloody Mary and

650
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:20,320
everybody else at the fucking school apparently looked at each other. I gasped. Alzheimer's

651
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:24,320
Yeah, I don't know. They just they just say he has Alzheimer's.

652
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:31,440
Oh, this is what she looks like by the way. If you guys didn't in the corner right over here,

653
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:36,480
you can kind of see the hair. I'm going on.

654
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:48,720
Chapter 23. The door opened and Professor Rumbridge and Cornelia fudge. That's an awesome last name

655
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:57,200
stomped out angrily. Then Dumbledome and Rumbridge sawed us in half because not like saw as in like

656
01:25:57,200 --> 01:26:09,360
saw you. Sawed as in with a hardware tool, by the way. Chow's in one. She looks like a prep. Yep,

657
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:16,160
yep, she does. Mr. Way. What the beep are you doing? Rumbridge. Wait.

658
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:22,640
Why did she call him Mr. Way? Is Dumbledore's last name

659
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:30,400
Way? Is he secretly Jared Way's brother? No, Reina, don't leave. Okay, she went and hopped in her bed.

660
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:38,080
Okay. Okay.

661
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:49,360
Oops. She made a mistake. Sorry. Dumbledore blared at her. Not glared blared. Oops. She made it. Wait.

662
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:58,000
What the fuck? I totally. It doesn't matter. She means hi. Everybody come in. See you and by the

663
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:08,080
way, everybody has to come. There's a mistake. I have to make sure.

664
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:13,760
My chair squeaky. I need to burp.

665
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:23,520
Well, we all came in angrily. So did all the other students just in this big ass office.

666
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:28,080
I sat between darkness and Draco and opposite Bloody Mary. Crab and Goyle started to make some

667
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:39,440
morbid jokes. They both looked exactly like Vile Volo. What? Who's Vile Volo? I don't know.

668
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:47,920
I ate the number. Some Count Chocula and Drake some blood from a cup. Where is she getting this?

669
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:55,680
Then I heard someone shooting angrily at a school. Come on. Put it away, bro.

670
01:27:57,360 --> 01:28:00,080
I looked behind me. It was vampire. Great vampires.

671
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:10,640
Doing stuff at the school. Oh, okay. Got you. I have never, I had never seen the person. I don't

672
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:15,040
think I've heard of that band. I have to look that up. I probably listen to their songs, but I just

673
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:24,480
never heard of the meme. Here, Draco, we're shooting at each other. Why are they shooting?

674
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:35,120
Vampire Draco WTF? I asked. You fucking bastard. Y'all, Draco had vampire. I want to shit next to her.

675
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:46,640
No, I do. I'm a vampire shouted. No, she doesn't like you, you son of a bitch. Y'all, Draco.

676
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:56,160
No, fuck you, motherfucker. She laughs me, not you. Y'all shouted vampire. And then he jumped on Draco.

677
01:28:56,160 --> 01:29:00,080
No, and not in that way, you perv. They started to fight and beat up each other.

678
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:07,120
Dumbledore yelled at them, but they didn't stop. All of a sudden, a terrible man with red eyes and no, no.

679
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:18,080
I want to say someone's name so bad as a joke, but I don't want their pants to come from me.

680
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:30,560
Insert with a vtuber of your choice. He had no nose and was wearing a gray robe.

681
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:37,600
All the glass in the window he flew through fell apart. Britney, that fucking prep started to cry.

682
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:44,960
Vampire Draco stopped fighting. I shopped eating. Everyone gasped. The room fell silent.

683
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:52,880
Full Zemort. Do it, Shibani. No, Shibani. Shibani doesn't. I don't want to. I don't want to get

684
01:29:52,880 --> 01:30:08,320
Sheebie in trouble. Eboby, Ebony, Darth Vader. Wait. Where did Darth Vader come from? Why is Darth Vader here?

685
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:28,640
I thought it was Voldemort. No, it's Darth Vader. Said it in his evil, in his raspy voice.

686
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:32,080
Thou hast failed your mission.

687
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:48,000
No, I shall kill Thou, and I shall kill Vampire as well. If Thou does not kill him before,

688
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:57,360
then I shall kill Draco too. Please don't make me kill him, please. I begged.

689
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:05,360
No. He laughed crudely. Kill him, or I shall kill him anyway.

690
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:14,720
Then he flew away cackling. Dirt Vruder. Made it as an impure new day to day life. I guess not.

691
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:24,880
I bust into tears. Draco and Vampire came to contort me.

692
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:34,320
Oh, let's do some contort. Suddenly my eyes rolled up, so they all looked so cool and gothic.

693
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:43,680
Am I cool and gothic?

694
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:57,280
I had a vision where I saw some lightning flash and then Voldemort coming to kill Draco. Will Draco

695
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:02,160
made some ketchup packets on his wrist in a depressed way?

696
01:32:02,160 --> 01:32:15,440
Hey. I'll contort you. No. I screamed sexily. Suddenly I locked up and stopped having the vision.

697
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:19,360
Ebony. Ebony. Ebony.

698
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:25,280
Excuse you honking your horn outside. I don't know if anybody else heard that.

699
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:31,200
Ebony. Ebony. Are you all right? Ask Draco in a worried voice.

700
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:37,200
Yeah. Yeah. I said sadly as I got up. Everything's all right and no me.

701
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:49,120
Vampire all senesitive. No, it's not. I shouted angrily. Tears of blood went down my face.

702
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:52,720
OMG. What if I'm getting possessed like in the ring too?

703
01:32:54,240 --> 01:33:00,640
It's okay girl. I said Bloody Mary. Maybe you should ask Professor Sinister about what the visions

704
01:33:00,640 --> 01:33:08,480
mean though. Okay bitch. I said sadly. Okay bitch. I said sadly and then we win.

705
01:33:10,720 --> 01:33:12,240
Chapter 24.

706
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:25,920
Well, we had deviation. Deviation. Divination. Deviation of a septum. Next. So I got to ask

707
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:35,840
Professor Travolry about the visions. Konnichiwa everybody come in.

708
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:42,800
I'll use another kawaii voice for everybody. Yeah, it's Sinister.

709
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:50,000
What is it I need to do? I'll give her, I'll give her like a, I don't know, like what does she have

710
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:55,760
like a northern UK accent? I don't, I can't, it's essentially Scottish or she's Scottish. I can't

711
01:33:55,760 --> 01:34:06,000
recall. Konnichiwa everybody come in. I said Professor Sinister in Japanese. What was that in

712
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:13,920
English? She smelled at me with her gothic black lipstick. She's the coolest fucking teacher ever.

713
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:20,720
She had long dead black hair with blood red tips and red eyes. Her mama's a vampire. She's also

714
01:34:20,720 --> 01:34:26,640
half Japanese so she speaks it in everything. She and Bloody Mary get along great. She's really

715
01:34:26,640 --> 01:34:33,040
young for a teacher. Who is supposed, who is this supposed to be? Who, who teaches divination in the,

716
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:39,920
in the books? She's Russian but moved to Scotland. Oh, interesting. Okay, I can't do

717
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:48,240
Scottish accent but I'll try my best. Today she was wearing black leather top with red lace and

718
01:34:48,240 --> 01:34:54,320
long gothic black rip dress. We went inside the black classroom with pastors of Emily the Strong.

719
01:34:54,320 --> 01:35:02,080
I don't, who is that? Emily the Strong? I raced my hand. I was wearing some black naipolite Polish

720
01:35:02,640 --> 01:35:10,160
the country, the, the nationality, the ethnicity with red pentagrams on it.

721
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:17,680
What is it happening? Yes. Hey, I love your naipolite. When did you get to talk topic?

722
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:25,760
Yeah, I answered all the preps who didn't know what HT was gave me weird looks. I gave them

723
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:32,080
middle finger. I wish I had my hand cam on because then when I, I would just, I would just flip you

724
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:40,480
guys off. Um, well, I have to talk about to you about some things. When do you want to do it?

725
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:49,520
How about now? She asked. Okay, I said. Okay, class fucking dismissed everyone.

726
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:56,400
Professor Trevoree said, and she let everyone go except, except for you, Brittany. She pointed

727
01:35:56,400 --> 01:36:05,120
up Brittany and some other preps. Please do exercise. Get it. One on page three. Exercise.

728
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:10,640
Wait, is Professor Sinister and Professor Trevoree the same person?

729
01:36:12,640 --> 01:36:15,520
It's not too late to hand cam. Yeah, I'd have to set all the shit up.

730
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:25,920
I'd be like, do it. Like, no, it was actually due as in like a paper is due. So yeah. Okay.

731
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:38,160
Please do exercise. One on page three. Okay, I'm having lots of visions. I said in a worried voice.

732
01:36:38,160 --> 01:36:45,040
I'm so worried. Draco is going to die. Well, she gave me a black crypt tall ball to lock in.

733
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:49,040
I looked at it. What day to see? She asked.

734
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:57,600
I said, I see a black, she got like some quotes like she's saying that

735
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:04,480
black gothic skull and a pentagram. Suddenly there was a knock on the door. I looked at it.

736
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:08,400
It was Draco. He was looking really sexy wearing a black leather facet.

737
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:16,000
Is that supposed to be jacket facet? A black gothic Lincoln Park t-shirt and black

738
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:23,200
Congress shoes, not converse Congress. Okay, you can go now see a con.

739
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:24,800
Professor.

740
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:35,600
Bye, bitch. I said waving.

741
01:37:38,160 --> 01:37:42,960
I went to Draco and vampire was sitting next to him. We both fall drink.

742
01:37:44,720 --> 01:37:49,840
I like a hiccup yard at the same time. Draco together and I was so exhibited.

743
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:52,160
Congress.

744
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:59,760
Wait, Congress shoes are real? It's not the Jedi way, no respect for her teacher.

745
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:04,240
Well, she, the teacher said, okay, you can go now see a con. So

746
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:09,360
all right, chapter 25.

747
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:19,360
I was so excited. I fellow Draco wondering if we were going to do it again.

748
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:24,080
We went outside. Wait, isn't, I thought vampire was also following us.

749
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:30,960
We went outside and then we went into Draco's black car.

750
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:34,480
I've been in with the fuck did Professor Trivalry say?

751
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:43,280
Whispered Draco potting his gothic wit hand with black nail polish on mine.

752
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:50,960
Polish. Hold it. You get it. He was painting her nails. Yep.

753
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:58,080
Oh, wait, no, he's, no, he wasn't painting her nails. He was just putting his painted hand,

754
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:02,880
his nails, his nails are painted and his hands are white because he is a white boy.

755
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:06,400
His nails are black and he was holding her hand. Okay, I get it.

756
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:08,240
It's so black.

757
01:39:11,680 --> 01:39:14,640
She said she would tell me what the visions meant tomorrow.

758
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:24,640
I grumbled in a sexy voice and he took out a heroin. What? Cabaret and spiked it and gave

759
01:39:24,640 --> 01:39:32,720
it to me to, what? He started to fly the car to the tree and to a tree. We went to the top of it.

760
01:39:32,720 --> 01:39:36,160
Draco potting his eyes. Are we doing heroin?

761
01:39:41,120 --> 01:39:49,440
What is happening? I don't even know. What the fuck is a cabaret? Like I felt like cabaret is a show.

762
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:57,120
Oh, I knew we weren't filming.

763
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:06,880
Okay.

764
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:16,560
And all the things that you never ever told me and all the smiles that are ever gonna haunt me.

765
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:22,160
I don't know the song saying Gerard's sexy voice. Then we started tilling off each other's

766
01:40:22,160 --> 01:40:31,360
clothes fevently. He took off my black thong and black leather bar, not a bra bar. I took off

767
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:41,440
his black boxers. Then he put his traubing, you know what, in my tools. Oh my fucking God, Draco,

768
01:40:42,400 --> 01:40:48,160
I screamed having an orgasm. We started fringing passively. Suddenly I fell asleep.

769
01:40:52,160 --> 01:40:56,000
Dick's so good. He put her ass to sleep. Now they call in him Nyquil.

770
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:02,160
I started tapping a tree.

771
01:41:03,120 --> 01:41:07,920
performer

772
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:24,400
okay okay

773
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:33,400
Okay, uh, isn't it a black guy who was shooting two Gothic men with long black hair?

774
01:41:33,400 --> 01:41:38,400
No, no, please don't fucking kill us. We're one direction.

775
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:42,400
Just kidding, it doesn't say that. They pleaded, but he kept shooting them. He ran away.

776
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:48,400
What is this racism? What did he run away to run a car?

777
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:55,400
No, my fucking god. I showed it in a scaring movie.

778
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:57,400
Ebony, what's wrong?

779
01:41:57,400 --> 01:42:06,400
Draco asked me as I woke up opening my icy blue eyes. I actually didn't know her eyes were blue. I thought they were red.

780
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:11,400
I started to cry tears of blood out my face.

781
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:16,400
I told Draco to call Vampire. He did it with this black Lincoln Park mobile.

782
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:26,400
But two T's. The worst thing was who the people were shot in the dream were Lucian and Ciri.

783
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:29,400
Are there any black people in Harry Potter?

784
01:42:29,400 --> 01:42:34,400
Why is there a red and black dude? Just kidding.

785
01:42:34,400 --> 01:42:39,400
What is this?

786
01:42:39,400 --> 01:42:44,400
Should I get my gun ready? I don't...

787
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:52,400
I think I just heard Boomi like meow to myself in his sleep. He was like...

788
01:42:52,400 --> 01:43:00,400
Do you think double four is black?

789
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:05,400
J.K. Rowling said there's no black people in England.

790
01:43:05,400 --> 01:43:10,400
Is that a real fucking person in the books?

791
01:43:10,400 --> 01:43:15,400
Kingsley Shackboat? That's terrible.

792
01:43:15,400 --> 01:43:20,400
I hate the way J.K. Rowling names. It's so bad.

793
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:27,400
Didn't she give an Asian character the most racist fucking name?

794
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:32,400
Sorry, racist.

795
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:40,400
This is gonna get... This is totally gonna get fucking demonetized.

796
01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:42,400
Oh, Kingsley Shackleford.

797
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:47,400
Cho Chang. Yeah, who the fuck? That's a stupidest name.

798
01:43:47,400 --> 01:43:53,400
Like what? That's so bad.

799
01:43:53,400 --> 01:43:58,400
Oh, anyways, continuing on.

800
01:43:58,400 --> 01:44:00,400
Chapter 20... Wait.

801
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:04,400
Chapter 26.

802
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:07,400
A few mutates later, Vampire came to the tree.

803
01:44:07,400 --> 01:44:13,400
He was wearing a black leather Jackson, black leather pants and a good Charlotte t-shirt.

804
01:44:13,400 --> 01:44:19,400
Hi, Vampire. I said flutterly as I started to sob.

805
01:44:19,400 --> 01:44:22,400
Go hug me sexily. How do you hug sexily?

806
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:25,400
She's crying. Stop trying to pull a move on her, dude.

807
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:28,400
Triants to come frot me.

808
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:30,400
Frotting?

809
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:35,400
I started to cry tears of blood and told them what happened.

810
01:44:35,400 --> 01:44:40,400
Oh, gorse. Oh, fuck it.

811
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:44,400
Vampire shouted angrily. He started to cry sadly.

812
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:48,400
What fucking dick did that?

813
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:53,400
I don't know. I said, now come on, we have to tell Dumbledore.

814
01:44:53,400 --> 01:44:58,400
We ran out of the tree and into the... Wait, we ran out of the tree?

815
01:44:58,400 --> 01:45:02,400
Aren't we like 50 feet up or like higher?

816
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:06,400
Dumbledore was sitting in his office.

817
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:10,400
Sire, our dads... Why did he call him Sire?

818
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:12,400
Sire, our dads have been shot.

819
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:15,400
Drake Cousin will be whipped.

820
01:45:15,400 --> 01:45:18,400
Whipped some tears from his white face.

821
01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:23,400
And nobody had a vision and a dream.

822
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:27,400
Dumbledore started to cockle.

823
01:45:27,400 --> 01:45:32,400
What? Started to what now?

824
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:35,400
Um...

825
01:45:35,400 --> 01:45:41,400
How do you expect me to know Ebony's not divisional?

826
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:45,400
I cleared a Dumbledore.

827
01:45:45,400 --> 01:45:50,400
Is that supposed to say delusional?

828
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:53,400
Divisional.

829
01:45:53,400 --> 01:45:56,400
Look, motherfucker.

830
01:45:56,400 --> 01:45:59,400
He said angrily.

831
01:45:59,400 --> 01:46:04,400
As Dumbledore gasped, see is that toot of cracker.

832
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:08,400
You know very well that I'm not decisional.

833
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:16,400
Now get some fucking people out there to look for Ceres and Lucian Ponto.

834
01:46:16,400 --> 01:46:20,400
Okay, he said an imitated voice, an intimated voice.

835
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:23,400
Where are they?

836
01:46:23,400 --> 01:46:26,400
I fought about it. I fought about it.

837
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:31,400
Then all of a sudden, long done.

838
01:46:31,400 --> 01:46:34,400
I said, I told him which street.

839
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:37,400
He went and called some people and did some stuff.

840
01:46:37,400 --> 01:46:42,400
After a few mis-tunes, he came back and said people were going out looking for them.

841
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:44,400
After a while, someone called him again.

842
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:46,400
He said that they have been found.

843
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:48,400
Jesus Christ, that was fast.

844
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:50,400
You know, good on Dumbledore for that.

845
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:53,400
Draco, Vampire, and I all left our rooms together.

846
01:46:53,400 --> 01:46:56,400
I went with Draco to wait in the nurse's office.

847
01:46:56,400 --> 01:47:01,400
Why? Well, Vampire went to make some catch-up packets in his room.

848
01:47:01,400 --> 01:47:06,400
We looked at each other's gothic, depressive eyes.

849
01:47:06,400 --> 01:47:08,400
Then we kissed.

850
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:15,400
Suddenly, Ceres and Lucian came in on stretchers and Professor Sinister was behind them.

851
01:47:15,400 --> 01:47:26,400
I like how Professor Sinister never, like, explained the vision we had.

852
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:28,400
Clip that, clip that.

853
01:47:28,400 --> 01:47:32,400
I need, I please, can someone make a compilation of me reading my immortal?

854
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:35,400
Please, please, please, I beg of you.

855
01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:39,400
Everyone in the room, Chapter 27.

856
01:47:41,400 --> 01:47:44,400
Everyone in the room stated to cry happily.

857
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:46,400
I had saved them.

858
01:47:46,400 --> 01:47:49,400
Draco, Lucian, Serious Bond.

859
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:52,400
Serious Bond?

860
01:47:53,400 --> 01:47:55,400
Like, is he James Bond?

861
01:47:55,400 --> 01:47:57,400
Vampire all came to hug me.

862
01:47:57,400 --> 01:48:00,400
The nurse started to give them medicine.

863
01:48:01,400 --> 01:48:07,400
Come on a nobie, said Professor Sinatra.

864
01:48:11,400 --> 01:48:19,400
She was wearing a gothic black leader dress with a corset top and real vampire blood on it.

865
01:48:19,400 --> 01:48:20,400
Wait, why would she?

866
01:48:20,400 --> 01:48:23,400
So that means she killed a vampire and put blood on it?

867
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:26,400
And fuking black platinum boots.

868
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:29,400
I have to tell you the fucking perdition.

869
01:48:29,400 --> 01:48:32,400
I locked at Lucian Serifs.

870
01:48:33,400 --> 01:48:35,400
Like the font.

871
01:48:35,400 --> 01:48:36,400
Drake?

872
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:37,400
Drake?

873
01:48:37,400 --> 01:48:38,400
Drake's here?

874
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:40,400
Where did Drake get here?

875
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:42,400
Didn't you get your ass beat by Kendrick?

876
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:44,400
What the fuck are you doing here, bro?

877
01:48:45,400 --> 01:48:47,400
Vampire, they nodded.

878
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:55,400
I smelled happily and went into a dark room.

879
01:48:55,400 --> 01:48:56,400
I had changed.

880
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:59,400
Professor Sinatra took out some black cards.

881
01:48:59,400 --> 01:49:01,400
That's a lot of sentence.

882
01:49:01,400 --> 01:49:04,400
She started to look into a black crucible ball.

883
01:49:04,400 --> 01:49:06,400
She said, Terra.

884
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:09,400
Who the fuck is Terra?

885
01:49:09,400 --> 01:49:10,400
Oh wait, no.

886
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:16,400
We did, I think we said our name was, we added Terra before Way before.

887
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:19,400
And like when I was introducing myself.

888
01:49:19,400 --> 01:49:21,400
Okay, Drake Bell.

889
01:49:21,400 --> 01:49:24,400
It's Drake, Drake and Josh.

890
01:49:24,400 --> 01:49:28,400
Nah, I'd like to think it was Drake, the rapper Drake.

891
01:49:28,400 --> 01:49:30,400
Um, Terra.

892
01:49:30,400 --> 01:49:32,400
I see Drac times are near.

893
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:33,400
She said badly.

894
01:49:33,400 --> 01:49:36,400
She peered into de balls.

895
01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:39,400
Drop your pants.

896
01:49:39,400 --> 01:49:43,400
You see, you must go back in time.

897
01:49:43,400 --> 01:49:47,400
She took out a time toner like Bloody Mary had.

898
01:49:47,400 --> 01:49:53,400
When Voldemort was in Hogwarts before he became powerful, he got his heart broken.

899
01:49:53,400 --> 01:49:58,400
Now do you think he would still become Voldemort if he was in love?

900
01:49:58,400 --> 01:50:00,400
I shook my head.

901
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:03,400
You must go back in time and seduce him.

902
01:50:03,400 --> 01:50:05,400
It is the only way.

903
01:50:05,400 --> 01:50:09,400
If he is still evil, then you must kill him.

904
01:50:09,400 --> 01:50:11,400
I don't know why I lost the accent.

905
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:15,400
You can come to my room tomorrow and you can do it.

906
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:16,400
Okay.

907
01:50:16,400 --> 01:50:18,400
I said sadly.

908
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:23,400
We did death touch sin.

909
01:50:23,400 --> 01:50:26,400
What is death touch sin?

910
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:28,400
We did death touch sin.

911
01:50:28,400 --> 01:50:30,400
Death touch sin.

912
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:31,400
Death touch sin.

913
01:50:31,400 --> 01:50:33,400
What is that?

914
01:50:33,400 --> 01:50:35,400
I'm picturing her like doing like devil horns.

915
01:50:35,400 --> 01:50:37,400
Hold on.

916
01:50:43,400 --> 01:50:45,400
Where is it?

917
01:50:49,400 --> 01:50:51,400
Where is it?

918
01:50:51,400 --> 01:50:53,400
Where is it?

919
01:50:53,400 --> 01:50:55,400
Where is it?

920
01:50:57,400 --> 01:51:02,400
So I'm picturing two hands.

921
01:51:04,400 --> 01:51:06,400
Just like doing this.

922
01:51:06,400 --> 01:51:07,400
Hold on.

923
01:51:07,400 --> 01:51:09,400
Let me grab another.

924
01:51:13,400 --> 01:51:16,400
I don't know why I named this straight jacket.

925
01:51:16,400 --> 01:51:18,400
Oh, I forgot to flip it.

926
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:19,400
It's fine.

927
01:51:19,400 --> 01:51:21,400
You get the idea.

928
01:51:21,400 --> 01:51:26,400
My computer is just like, why did you add more assets?

929
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:27,400
Rock on.

930
01:51:27,400 --> 01:51:29,400
Homie G's.

931
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:37,400
Poor PC, yeah.

932
01:51:37,400 --> 01:51:38,400
Okay.

933
01:51:38,400 --> 01:51:40,400
Where did the thing go?

934
01:51:41,400 --> 01:51:43,400
Where's it?

935
01:51:47,400 --> 01:51:49,400
What the strike working?

936
01:51:49,400 --> 01:51:56,400
Go back in time and seduce him.

937
01:51:56,400 --> 01:52:00,400
I'm going back in time and I'm seducing it.

938
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:02,400
Okay.

939
01:52:02,400 --> 01:52:03,240
Okay.

940
01:52:06,420 --> 01:52:09,920
What fucking happened as Draco and Vampire?

941
01:52:09,920 --> 01:52:10,960
Yeah, what happened?

942
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:13,840
As darkness willow and bloody Mary, question mark.

943
01:52:13,840 --> 01:52:15,160
I need to drink the water.

944
01:52:18,160 --> 01:52:21,520
I was about to tell them, but everyone was there.

945
01:52:21,520 --> 01:52:24,800
They were celebrating Lucy and his serious being fond.

946
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:28,300
Everyone was proud of me, but I just wanted to talk to Draco.

947
01:52:29,300 --> 01:52:33,620
They were teasing my name and some reporters were there

948
01:52:33,620 --> 01:52:35,860
trying to interview Dumbledore.

949
01:52:35,860 --> 01:52:37,240
A banner was put up.

950
01:52:37,240 --> 01:52:39,100
Lots of fucking preps were there.

951
01:52:39,100 --> 01:52:41,780
Obviously trying to be gothic

952
01:52:41,780 --> 01:52:44,780
wearing the hymn sign on their hands,

953
01:52:44,780 --> 01:52:48,860
despite not having actually heard of him.

954
01:52:48,860 --> 01:52:50,940
Even Mr. Norris looked happy.

955
01:52:50,940 --> 01:52:53,460
A black and red cake had been brought out.

956
01:52:53,460 --> 01:52:56,860
Crab and Goyk set up some fireworks

957
01:52:56,860 --> 01:53:00,420
and the shape of skulls from Wesley's Wizard Wises.

958
01:53:01,660 --> 01:53:04,820
I put on my invisibility Coke with Vampire and Draco

959
01:53:04,820 --> 01:53:07,020
and we sneaked outside together.

960
01:53:10,100 --> 01:53:11,220
Damn preps.

961
01:53:12,140 --> 01:53:12,980
Thank you.

962
01:53:12,980 --> 01:53:13,820
Okay, eight out of 10.

963
01:53:13,820 --> 01:53:14,660
All right, I'll take that.

964
01:53:14,660 --> 01:53:15,980
I'll take that.

965
01:53:15,980 --> 01:53:19,460
Wait, why is Shaggy in the top over here?

966
01:53:19,460 --> 01:53:20,500
Is that supposed to be?

967
01:53:20,500 --> 01:53:22,740
Oh, sorry, that's Diabolo.

968
01:53:22,740 --> 01:53:24,140
Okay, probably Ron.

969
01:53:25,140 --> 01:53:27,980
Okay.

970
01:53:27,980 --> 01:53:30,460
Chapter 28.

971
01:53:33,140 --> 01:53:35,700
We went into a black room.

972
01:53:35,700 --> 01:53:38,220
The walls were black with portraits of gothic bands

973
01:53:38,220 --> 01:53:41,740
like MCR, GC and Marilyn Manson all over them.

974
01:53:41,740 --> 01:53:43,940
A big black coffin was in the middle.

975
01:53:43,940 --> 01:53:44,780
Red velvet.

976
01:53:44,780 --> 01:53:46,980
I said in the middle, but it says the.

977
01:53:46,980 --> 01:53:50,940
Like that's how you know how messed up I am reading this.

978
01:53:50,940 --> 01:53:51,820
Red velvet.

979
01:53:51,820 --> 01:53:52,660
Oh, cute.

980
01:53:52,980 --> 01:53:54,060
Okay.

981
01:53:54,060 --> 01:53:55,700
Lined the black box.

982
01:53:56,580 --> 01:53:59,420
They were, there were three chairs made of bones

983
01:53:59,420 --> 01:54:01,180
with real skulls in them.

984
01:54:01,180 --> 01:54:04,060
I was wearing a black, did I spill water in between my legs?

985
01:54:04,060 --> 01:54:04,900
Why am I wet?

986
01:54:04,900 --> 01:54:06,940
Um, that sounds bad.

987
01:54:06,940 --> 01:54:09,580
I was wearing a black corset bar

988
01:54:09,580 --> 01:54:11,540
with purple stuff on it.

989
01:54:11,540 --> 01:54:14,780
Fishnet suckings and a black leather thong underneath.

990
01:54:14,780 --> 01:54:15,980
Was I wearing clothes?

991
01:54:17,860 --> 01:54:22,060
My, am I just wearing a thong and fishnets in a bra?

992
01:54:23,660 --> 01:54:28,260
That's pretty hardcore.

993
01:54:28,260 --> 01:54:31,980
So she looks like the average Vtuber.

994
01:54:31,980 --> 01:54:32,820
I love it.

995
01:54:33,980 --> 01:54:37,020
I sat down and wanted to chairs dispersedly.

996
01:54:37,020 --> 01:54:39,620
So did Draco and vampire.

997
01:54:39,620 --> 01:54:40,700
Are you okay?

998
01:54:40,700 --> 01:54:43,180
Wait, are you okay?

999
01:54:43,180 --> 01:54:47,580
Vampire asked potting his alabastered hand on mine.

1000
01:54:47,580 --> 01:54:49,500
He was wearing black nail polish.

1001
01:54:49,500 --> 01:54:52,580
I was wearing black nail polish with red crosses on it.

1002
01:54:52,580 --> 01:54:54,260
Yeah, I guess, I said sadly.

1003
01:54:54,260 --> 01:54:57,580
Draco also pot his hand on mine sexily.

1004
01:54:57,580 --> 01:55:00,180
I smiled sadly with my black lipstick.

1005
01:55:00,180 --> 01:55:04,740
The problem is, I have to seduce Volzemort.

1006
01:55:04,740 --> 01:55:06,460
I'll have to go back in time.

1007
01:55:07,340 --> 01:55:08,860
Draco started to cry sadly.

1008
01:55:10,220 --> 01:55:11,300
Vampire hooked him.

1009
01:55:14,580 --> 01:55:15,420
It's okay.

1010
01:55:15,420 --> 01:55:19,980
I know it bo, it boby, it booby, it boby, it bobby.

1011
01:55:19,980 --> 01:55:22,980
He said finally, but what about me?

1012
01:55:22,980 --> 01:55:26,780
You're not gonna break up or anything, are you?

1013
01:55:26,780 --> 01:55:28,620
Of course not.

1014
01:55:30,180 --> 01:55:31,300
I guessed.

1015
01:55:31,300 --> 01:55:32,620
Really?

1016
01:55:32,620 --> 01:55:33,700
He asked.

1017
01:55:33,700 --> 01:55:35,180
Sure, I said.

1018
01:55:35,180 --> 01:55:39,540
Refrenched sexually, vampire looked at us longingly.

1019
01:55:40,380 --> 01:55:41,460
Wait a second.

1020
01:55:45,020 --> 01:55:46,300
Sorry, I just read ahead.

1021
01:55:46,300 --> 01:55:47,140
Mom.

1022
01:55:49,500 --> 01:55:52,460
Then I took off Draco's MCR,

1023
01:55:52,460 --> 01:55:56,220
shrift, and seductively took off his pants.

1024
01:55:56,220 --> 01:55:58,100
He was hung like a Stallone.

1025
01:55:59,540 --> 01:56:03,900
He had replaced the vampire tattoo that said Ennobe on it.

1026
01:56:03,900 --> 01:56:05,740
Black roses were around it.

1027
01:56:05,740 --> 01:56:06,980
I gasped.

1028
01:56:06,980 --> 01:56:09,380
He looked exactly like Gerard Way.

1029
01:56:09,380 --> 01:56:11,540
Vampire took a video camera.

1030
01:56:11,540 --> 01:56:13,740
I had said it was okay before.

1031
01:56:13,740 --> 01:56:15,220
I took off my clothes.

1032
01:56:15,260 --> 01:56:20,020
Then we were in for the ride of our life.

1033
01:56:20,980 --> 01:56:24,300
We started freching as we climbed into the coffin.

1034
01:56:24,300 --> 01:56:26,940
He put his spock in mine, you know what?

1035
01:56:26,940 --> 01:56:28,780
Impassively we did it.

1036
01:56:30,180 --> 01:56:32,460
I love you Ennobe, it boby.

1037
01:56:32,460 --> 01:56:34,500
Oh, let me feel you, I need to feel you.

1038
01:56:34,500 --> 01:56:37,100
He screamed as we got an orgasm.

1039
01:56:37,100 --> 01:56:39,580
We watched vampire filmed everything perfectly.

1040
01:56:39,580 --> 01:56:43,500
Suddenly, what the fuck are you doing?

1041
01:56:43,500 --> 01:56:47,060
It was Snoop and Professor McGoggle.

1042
01:56:47,060 --> 01:56:48,220
One, one, one.

1043
01:56:49,780 --> 01:56:51,460
No, vampire was just a cock.

1044
01:56:52,580 --> 01:56:54,620
Everybody points and laughs at the cook.

1045
01:56:54,620 --> 01:56:57,020
Everybody points and laughs at the cook.

1046
01:56:57,020 --> 01:57:02,020
Point and laugh at vampire Harry Potter, the cock.

1047
01:57:06,780 --> 01:57:09,100
Chapter 29.

1048
01:57:11,780 --> 01:57:12,620
Are you ready?

1049
01:57:14,500 --> 01:57:19,500
Oh, my Satan, we screamed as we jammed out of the coffin.

1050
01:57:19,500 --> 01:57:21,500
Snap and Professor McGoggle.

1051
01:57:21,500 --> 01:57:22,500
McGoggle.

1052
01:57:24,500 --> 01:57:27,500
Started to shoot at us angrily.

1053
01:57:27,500 --> 01:57:32,500
Come now, preacher McGoggle yielded.

1054
01:57:33,500 --> 01:57:35,500
We did it, killed the way.

1055
01:57:37,500 --> 01:57:39,500
We did it, killed the way.

1056
01:57:39,500 --> 01:57:41,500
We did it, killed the way.

1057
01:57:41,500 --> 01:57:43,500
We did it, killed the way.

1058
01:57:44,500 --> 01:57:45,500
We left the room.

1059
01:57:45,500 --> 01:57:48,500
She just, she just came out of them to come

1060
01:57:48,500 --> 01:57:51,500
and then they just came and I'm impressed.

1061
01:57:54,500 --> 01:57:56,500
We left the room putting on her clothes.

1062
01:57:56,500 --> 01:58:00,500
Snoop, Snoop dogs here.

1063
01:58:00,500 --> 01:58:03,500
Garved the caramel and put it in his pocket.

1064
01:58:04,500 --> 01:58:06,500
Hey, what the fuck?

1065
01:58:06,500 --> 01:58:09,500
I'm a vampire shooting angrily.

1066
01:58:12,500 --> 01:58:14,500
Yeah, Buster, what the fuck are you going to do

1067
01:58:14,500 --> 01:58:16,500
with the fucking camera?

1068
01:58:16,500 --> 01:58:19,500
Draco demonded, all protective,

1069
01:58:19,500 --> 01:58:22,500
looking at me longly with his gothic red eyes.

1070
01:58:22,500 --> 01:58:25,500
Look, Dumbledore knows your little secret

1071
01:58:25,500 --> 01:58:28,500
and if you do this again, then you will go to St. Mango's.

1072
01:58:28,500 --> 01:58:30,500
So give back to camera.

1073
01:58:32,500 --> 01:58:34,500
The mystery of magic thinks he is crazy.

1074
01:58:34,500 --> 01:58:36,500
There's no way a day will believe him.

1075
01:58:36,500 --> 01:58:38,500
Snoop laughed meanly.

1076
01:58:38,500 --> 01:58:40,500
There was no, there's no quotes.

1077
01:58:40,500 --> 01:58:42,500
I couldn't tell who was talking.

1078
01:58:43,500 --> 01:58:46,500
Yes, so shut your mouth, you m-m-m-m-poof.

1079
01:58:46,500 --> 01:58:49,500
You in-losent fools.

1080
01:58:49,500 --> 01:58:51,500
Yelled Professor McGoggle.

1081
01:58:51,500 --> 01:58:56,500
She made us come into her room with white stones all around it.

1082
01:58:56,500 --> 01:58:58,500
Looks like this is happening before.

1083
01:58:58,500 --> 01:59:02,500
There was all these wh-what, we read tools in it.

1084
01:59:02,500 --> 01:59:04,500
Draco started to cry all sexy.

1085
01:59:04,500 --> 01:59:07,500
Oh, oh, oh.

1086
01:59:07,500 --> 01:59:09,500
And sexative, get it?

1087
01:59:09,500 --> 01:59:11,500
Cause he's a sex bomb, LOL.

1088
01:59:11,500 --> 01:59:13,500
Tom fell not rules for life,

1089
01:59:13,500 --> 01:59:16,500
but not as mugs, as Gerard,

1090
01:59:16,500 --> 01:59:18,500
your sex on legs.

1091
01:59:18,500 --> 01:59:21,500
I love you, you fucking rock, marry me.

1092
01:59:24,500 --> 01:59:26,500
I don't know why I slept with you.

1093
01:59:26,500 --> 01:59:31,500
I'm really bad accent when I have to read a lot of misspellings.

1094
01:59:31,500 --> 01:59:33,500
I started to cry tears of blood.

1095
01:59:33,500 --> 01:59:37,500
It happens in Vampire Chronicles, Raven said.

1096
01:59:37,500 --> 01:59:39,500
So okay, so fuck you.

1097
01:59:39,500 --> 01:59:41,500
Um, they actually, they cry,

1098
01:59:41,500 --> 01:59:43,500
Vampires cry blood and true blood.

1099
01:59:43,500 --> 01:59:45,500
One of my favorite guilty pleasure shows.

1100
01:59:45,500 --> 01:59:48,500
Um, although I stopped watching after season six,

1101
01:59:48,500 --> 01:59:50,500
cause it was just so bad.

1102
01:59:50,500 --> 01:59:52,500
Um, Vampire took out,

1103
01:59:52,500 --> 01:59:55,500
took out a black hunker chip chief

1104
01:59:57,500 --> 02:00:00,500
and started to wipe my red eyes.

1105
02:00:00,500 --> 02:00:05,500
And then he and Snoop both took out guns using magic.

1106
02:00:05,500 --> 02:00:08,500
They started to shoot each other angrily.

1107
02:00:08,500 --> 02:00:11,500
Hold on, I need to, I need to make sure I'm strapped.

1108
02:00:14,500 --> 02:00:16,500
I need to make sure I'm strapped.

1109
02:00:19,500 --> 02:00:21,500
Perfect.

1110
02:00:22,500 --> 02:00:24,500
Uh-huh.

1111
02:00:26,500 --> 02:00:27,500
Blau, blau.

1112
02:00:37,500 --> 02:00:38,500
You like that?

1113
02:00:38,500 --> 02:00:44,500
Um, none of the bullets got on each other yet.

1114
02:00:44,500 --> 02:00:45,500
I took out my wand.

1115
02:00:45,500 --> 02:00:47,500
This is my wand, as you can see.

1116
02:00:47,500 --> 02:00:48,500
Cosio.

1117
02:00:48,500 --> 02:00:51,500
I shouted snap, started to scrum and he dropped the gun,

1118
02:00:51,500 --> 02:00:53,500
but it was too late.

1119
02:00:53,500 --> 02:00:56,500
Both of them had run out of ballots, of bellies.

1120
02:00:56,500 --> 02:00:58,500
I stopped to curse.

1121
02:00:58,500 --> 02:01:02,500
Professor McGoogle did a spell so that we were all chained up.

1122
02:01:02,500 --> 02:01:04,500
Ooh, she took out a box of tools.

1123
02:01:04,500 --> 02:01:05,500
Then she said,

1124
02:01:07,500 --> 02:01:10,500
Okay, Severus, I'm going to go now.

1125
02:01:10,500 --> 02:01:11,500
She laughs.

1126
02:01:11,500 --> 02:01:13,500
Snap started to laugh evilly.

1127
02:01:13,500 --> 02:01:15,500
Vampire started to cry.

1128
02:01:15,500 --> 02:01:17,500
It's okay, a nobie, said Draco.

1129
02:01:17,500 --> 02:01:18,500
Evergreen.

1130
02:01:19,500 --> 02:01:20,500
Who?

1131
02:01:28,500 --> 02:01:29,500
You know what?

1132
02:01:29,500 --> 02:01:31,500
I think she will be all right.

1133
02:01:31,500 --> 02:01:34,500
Remember the city you took of Snake.

1134
02:01:34,500 --> 02:01:36,500
Snape laughed again.

1135
02:01:36,500 --> 02:01:39,500
And then he took out some whips.

1136
02:01:45,500 --> 02:01:48,500
Bro, I hate this fucking dog, bro.

1137
02:01:52,500 --> 02:01:56,500
This dog is always, like, always walks by yelling.

1138
02:01:58,500 --> 02:01:59,500
I'll wait.

1139
02:01:59,500 --> 02:02:01,500
I can wait.

1140
02:02:01,500 --> 02:02:02,500
Teacher voice.

1141
02:02:02,500 --> 02:02:04,500
I can wait.

1142
02:02:04,500 --> 02:02:05,500
The bell doesn't dismiss you.

1143
02:02:05,500 --> 02:02:07,500
I do, sweetheart.

1144
02:02:07,500 --> 02:02:09,500
I can wait.

1145
02:02:15,500 --> 02:02:33,500
I think the dog barks because it knows that there's people in their apartments.

1146
02:02:33,500 --> 02:02:39,500
Oh, my God.

1147
02:02:39,500 --> 02:02:44,500
Are we done?

1148
02:02:45,500 --> 02:02:46,500
Is he done?

1149
02:02:48,500 --> 02:02:50,500
Please, is he, is he done?

1150
02:02:52,500 --> 02:02:53,500
Please let him, please.

1151
02:02:53,500 --> 02:02:55,500
Okay, I think we're good.

1152
02:02:55,500 --> 02:02:56,500
Bro, is he yapping?

1153
02:02:56,500 --> 02:03:00,500
I think as he heard my voice, usually when you, and dogs have better hearing than humans,

1154
02:03:00,500 --> 02:03:04,500
but you can kind of sometimes hear people if they're talking loudly.

1155
02:03:05,500 --> 02:03:06,500
Okay.

1156
02:03:07,500 --> 02:03:09,500
And took out some whips.

1157
02:03:09,500 --> 02:03:10,500
Bark, bark, bark.

1158
02:03:10,500 --> 02:03:12,500
Chapter 30.

1159
02:03:13,500 --> 02:03:14,500
Oh.

1160
02:03:16,500 --> 02:03:18,500
No, we screamed sadly.

1161
02:03:18,500 --> 02:03:21,500
Snap stated loafing meanly.

1162
02:03:22,500 --> 02:03:23,500
Are you fucking serious?

1163
02:03:23,500 --> 02:03:25,500
He took out a camera, Anvilie.

1164
02:03:25,500 --> 02:03:28,500
Then he came towards Darko.

1165
02:03:28,500 --> 02:03:29,500
Tony Darko's here.

1166
02:03:29,500 --> 02:03:32,500
He took some stones out of his pocket.

1167
02:03:32,500 --> 02:03:37,500
He put the stones around Draco and knit a candle.

1168
02:03:38,500 --> 02:03:40,500
Like, knit as in brightness.

1169
02:03:40,500 --> 02:03:42,500
So then I guess that applies.

1170
02:03:43,500 --> 02:03:45,500
What the fuck are you doing?

1171
02:03:45,500 --> 02:03:46,500
I shoot it angrily.

1172
02:03:46,500 --> 02:03:47,500
Pew, pew.

1173
02:03:48,500 --> 02:03:49,500
Pew, pew.

1174
02:03:49,500 --> 02:03:50,500
Bow, bow.

1175
02:03:50,500 --> 02:03:51,500
Bow, bow.

1176
02:03:51,500 --> 02:03:52,500
Put that away.

1177
02:03:55,500 --> 02:03:56,500
I shoot it angrily.

1178
02:03:58,500 --> 02:03:59,500
Uh.

1179
02:04:02,500 --> 02:04:03,500
Where I lost my place.

1180
02:04:06,500 --> 02:04:07,500
Snoop laughed meanly.

1181
02:04:07,500 --> 02:04:09,500
He pulled down his pants.

1182
02:04:09,500 --> 02:04:10,500
I gasped.

1183
02:04:10,500 --> 02:04:12,500
There was a dark mark.

1184
02:04:12,500 --> 02:04:15,500
A dark mark on his, you know what?

1185
02:04:15,500 --> 02:04:16,500
What?

1186
02:04:17,500 --> 02:04:18,500
I don't know what a dark.

1187
02:04:18,500 --> 02:04:21,500
That's like the little like snake symbol, isn't it?

1188
02:04:21,500 --> 02:04:22,500
I don't know.

1189
02:04:23,500 --> 02:04:25,500
He waved his wand and a knife came.

1190
02:04:25,500 --> 02:04:27,500
He spelled, she spelled a knife wrong.

1191
02:04:27,500 --> 02:04:29,500
He gave the knife to me.

1192
02:04:29,500 --> 02:04:32,500
You must romp here.

1193
02:04:32,500 --> 02:04:36,500
He said to me, if you don't, then I'll wrap Draco.

1194
02:04:37,500 --> 02:04:40,500
No, you fucking bastard.

1195
02:04:40,500 --> 02:04:41,500
I yielded.

1196
02:04:41,500 --> 02:04:44,500
But then Draco looked at me sadly with his evil,

1197
02:04:44,500 --> 02:04:47,500
gothic red eyes that look so depressant and sexy.

1198
02:04:47,500 --> 02:04:49,500
He looked exactly like a pentagram.

1199
02:04:49,500 --> 02:04:51,500
I'll get it cause I'm a Satanist.

1200
02:04:51,500 --> 02:04:53,500
Between Kurt Cobain and Gerard.

1201
02:04:53,500 --> 02:04:54,500
It took me a while to figure this out,

1202
02:04:54,500 --> 02:04:56,500
but she meant pentagram as in like cross,

1203
02:04:56,500 --> 02:04:57,500
like a cross between,

1204
02:04:57,500 --> 02:04:58,500
but she says pentagram instead.

1205
02:04:58,500 --> 02:04:59,500
It's actually pretty clever.

1206
02:05:00,500 --> 02:05:03,500
But then I looked at vampire and he looked so smexy too

1207
02:05:03,500 --> 02:05:05,500
with his gothic black hair.

1208
02:05:05,500 --> 02:05:08,500
I thought of the time when we screwed, wait,

1209
02:05:09,500 --> 02:05:12,500
wait, she fucked vampire.

1210
02:05:16,500 --> 02:05:19,500
And that's, wait, I thought they just kissed.

1211
02:05:19,500 --> 02:05:21,500
Holy shit.

1212
02:05:21,500 --> 02:05:23,500
She just straight up anyways.

1213
02:05:23,500 --> 02:05:26,500
And the time I did it with Draco and Dumbledore came

1214
02:05:26,500 --> 02:05:29,500
in the team where Draco almost,

1215
02:05:29,500 --> 02:05:34,500
Suisse, Dald and vampire was so sportive.

1216
02:05:34,500 --> 02:05:37,500
Snipe laughed angrily.

1217
02:05:37,500 --> 02:05:40,500
He started to pray to Volzemort.

1218
02:05:40,500 --> 02:05:43,500
He started to do an incapacitation dancing

1219
02:05:43,500 --> 02:05:47,500
around the stokes whipping Draco and vampire.

1220
02:05:47,500 --> 02:05:49,500
Suddenly a idea I had.

1221
02:05:49,500 --> 02:05:54,500
I closed up my eyes and using my vampire powers.

1222
02:05:54,500 --> 02:05:59,500
I sent a telepathetic mess massage to Draco and vampire

1223
02:05:59,500 --> 02:06:02,500
so they would destruct Snape.

1224
02:06:02,500 --> 02:06:04,500
Dumbledork will get you.

1225
02:06:04,500 --> 02:06:05,500
I'm sorry.

1226
02:06:05,500 --> 02:06:06,500
Dumbledork will get you.

1227
02:06:06,500 --> 02:06:07,500
Draco's shooting.

1228
02:06:07,500 --> 02:06:08,500
Yeah.

1229
02:06:08,500 --> 02:06:11,500
Just wait until the mystery find out.

1230
02:06:11,500 --> 02:06:13,500
Vampire yelled.

1231
02:06:13,500 --> 02:06:16,500
Meanwhile, I took out my wand.

1232
02:06:17,500 --> 02:06:20,500
You ridiculous dunderhead.

1233
02:06:20,500 --> 02:06:22,500
I can't do the Snape voice right now.

1234
02:06:22,500 --> 02:06:23,500
Snoop.

1235
02:06:23,500 --> 02:06:25,500
You ridiculous dunderhead.

1236
02:06:25,500 --> 02:06:27,500
I can't do a Snoop Dogg voice either.

1237
02:06:28,500 --> 02:06:32,500
He took off Draco's clothes.

1238
02:06:32,500 --> 02:06:35,500
Just as he was about to grape juice him.

1239
02:06:35,500 --> 02:06:39,500
Crucio, I shitted, pointed my wound.

1240
02:06:39,500 --> 02:06:42,500
Snoop scrimmed and started running around the room

1241
02:06:42,500 --> 02:06:43,500
scrimming.

1242
02:06:43,500 --> 02:06:45,500
Meanwhile, I grabbed my black mobile

1243
02:06:45,500 --> 02:06:46,500
and sent a text to Sirius.

1244
02:06:46,500 --> 02:06:48,500
I stopped doing Crucio.

1245
02:06:48,500 --> 02:06:50,500
You dunderhead.

1246
02:06:50,500 --> 02:06:51,500
I'm going to kill.

1247
02:06:51,500 --> 02:06:54,500
Shooted Snape as then suddenly Severus came.

1248
02:06:54,500 --> 02:06:57,500
Wait, but they're the same person.

1249
02:07:02,500 --> 02:07:04,500
Snake put the whip behind his back.

1250
02:07:04,500 --> 02:07:05,500
Oh, hello, Seth.

1251
02:07:05,500 --> 02:07:07,500
I was just teaching them something.

1252
02:07:07,500 --> 02:07:08,500
He lied.

1253
02:07:08,500 --> 02:07:11,500
But suddenly Lucian and Professor Traveler came into

1254
02:07:11,500 --> 02:07:14,500
room and Sirius unlocked the chains and put them

1255
02:07:14,500 --> 02:07:15,500
around Snape.

1256
02:07:15,500 --> 02:07:19,500
Then Professor Traveler said, hold on.

1257
02:07:19,500 --> 02:07:21,500
Come on, Neboni.

1258
02:07:21,500 --> 02:07:22,500
Let's go.

1259
02:07:24,500 --> 02:07:27,500

1321
02:14:50,660 --> 02:14:55,740
keep it up for I just want to make sure like cuz I want people to be able to

1322
02:14:55,740 --> 02:15:02,900
make it especially cuz it's a member stream and I don't want people to get

1323
02:15:02,900 --> 02:15:06,740
like cuz it's usually funner like to do that sort of stream when you're there I

1324
02:15:06,900 --> 02:15:14,100
don't have okay what games have I been playing I've been playing cult of the

1325
02:15:14,100 --> 02:15:33,220
lamb sometimes I could probably beat that I could play Elden Ring but like again I

1326
02:15:33,220 --> 02:15:42,140
wouldn't we're not gonna get far cuz I'm a slow gamer and I haven't played

1327
02:15:42,140 --> 02:15:46,420
Elden Ring in like a year so I'm not gonna be good but I do want to play the

1328
02:15:46,420 --> 02:16:10,460
DLC okay you like the adventuring part okay alright I just like cuz I like I

1329
02:16:10,460 --> 02:16:18,860
literally just like wander for fucking hours but maybe cuz um you can have the

1330
02:16:18,860 --> 02:16:22,420
hair and help but I don't want you guys to help like I don't I don't want my hand

1331
02:16:22,420 --> 02:16:28,740
held for that I'll just have to think of a build beforehand and then remember how

1332
02:16:28,740 --> 02:16:33,860
I get my runes before cuz I usually do a certain thing to get more runes off the

1333
02:16:33,860 --> 02:16:41,420
bat like a level up faster um I'd never really to be honest I didn't really use

1334
02:16:41,420 --> 02:16:50,420
spirit summons a lot except for mimic tier hardest soul's game DLC attempted by

1335
02:16:50,420 --> 02:16:56,580
shivony darkness dementia bum Raven Way I don't do I have to play through the

1336
02:16:56,580 --> 02:17:01,100
entire game and get an ending in order for me to play the DLC because again I

1337
02:17:01,100 --> 02:17:10,940
beat Elden Ring on my PlayStation I didn't I only just got it for PC not as

1338
02:17:10,940 --> 02:17:16,500
beat Moog okay okay okay so I yeah okay then I'll probably speedrun and beat

1339
02:17:16,500 --> 02:17:32,580
Radon and Moog is such a fucking bitch to fight um to she bees to she bees okay

1340
02:17:32,580 --> 02:17:36,900
what day would you guys like me to play Elden Ring what's a good game for

1341
02:17:36,900 --> 02:17:38,900
everyone

1342
02:17:42,900 --> 02:17:47,580
we're done oh we're done I can just cheese we're done that's not hard although I

1343
02:17:47,580 --> 02:17:51,540
can cheese Moog too but

1344
02:17:56,980 --> 02:18:01,740
my face when I spread misinformation

1345
02:18:01,740 --> 02:18:17,260
I've got a free schedule all week you just want to you just want to Elden Ring

1346
02:18:17,260 --> 02:18:23,420
fucking all week marathon I think you scheduling your days off first makes the

1347
02:18:23,420 --> 02:18:25,780
most sense yeah but I don't really care about my days off because I just want to

1348
02:18:25,780 --> 02:18:28,620
hang out with you guys about time

1349
02:18:31,740 --> 02:18:37,220
sorry

1350
02:18:38,220 --> 02:18:40,220
my little sister is

1351
02:18:44,220 --> 02:18:50,140
people on the 4th oh that's right July 4th I forget holidays exist

1352
02:18:50,300 --> 02:18:52,300
um

1353
02:18:57,260 --> 02:19:01,100
I think I was invited by Salem to go over her house

1354
02:19:01,100 --> 02:19:04,940
that's what we look cool that she has let me see

1355
02:19:04,940 --> 02:19:06,940
Salem

1356
02:19:14,620 --> 02:19:19,420
okay I'm sure she did all of can't make it because she's in the middle of her family

1357
02:19:19,420 --> 02:19:22,860
I'm not really used to celebrating holidays I was brought up and I did

1358
02:19:22,860 --> 02:19:26,140
celebrating holidays so I forget the holidays exist sometimes

1359
02:19:26,140 --> 02:19:32,540
um so I'll do

1360
02:19:33,420 --> 02:19:39,820
I'll do Elden Ring okay it looks like Azura has a membership stream at 4 p.m. on

1361
02:19:39,820 --> 02:19:43,420
Wednesday so I'll do Elden Ring on Wednesday after her at

1362
02:19:43,420 --> 02:19:47,740
6 p.m. and I'll probably just like play until

1363
02:19:47,820 --> 02:19:51,660
oh wait no or she's not even streaming well okay well we'll just do an Elden Ring

1364
02:19:51,660 --> 02:19:55,580
run she be

1365
02:19:56,060 --> 02:19:59,580
Elden Ring

1366
02:20:17,900 --> 02:20:24,780
let's do it okay just play cool cool cool and then okay I'll guess so I'll

1367
02:20:24,780 --> 02:20:28,940
probably I might do a gorilla on the 4th before I

1368
02:20:28,940 --> 02:20:34,220
go maybe just like a zatsu um

1369
02:20:34,220 --> 02:20:36,860
in the morning

1370
02:20:37,340 --> 02:20:39,980
face is itchy

1371
02:20:40,620 --> 02:20:44,060
I'm like breaking out I think it's because of the fucking heat and the sweat

1372
02:20:44,060 --> 02:20:47,660
and I feel so fucking gross and you get some like those acne dot things

1373
02:20:47,980 --> 02:20:52,460

probably stream in the morning and do like a zatsu

1380
02:21:26,700 --> 02:21:31,660
um but I don't want to hold myself to it if like Salem needs help getting

1381
02:21:31,660 --> 02:21:37,340

02:22:16,860 --> 02:22:19,580
why do I have a pitch for because it's going up your ass

1391
02:22:19,580 --> 02:22:27,180
um what do you classify as morning uh I classify 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. is morning

1392
02:22:27,180 --> 02:22:30,860
or like 11 a.m. is like early afternoon

1393
02:22:31,660 --> 02:22:36,860
forced vtuber vacation it's just awesome because like I told strongy this idea

1394
02:22:36,940 --> 02:22:41,260
and like no me and me and Salem have had this idea for a very very long time

1395
02:22:41,260 --> 02:22:45,100
um since we started becoming friends for several years

1396
02:22:45,100 --> 02:22:49,980
and then I get to live out this cool podcasting dream idea and then get to

1397
02:22:49,980 --> 02:22:52,860
invite other girls that like smutty books because it's going to be a

1398
02:22:52,860 --> 02:22:56,300
smutty book podcast but I have it's going to take such a long I might take

1399
02:22:56,300 --> 02:23:00,300
like a year to get that together though because I have to help

1400
02:23:00,300 --> 02:23:05,100

1446
02:28:55,820 --> 02:28:57,020
because I'm looking at

1447
02:28:58,540 --> 02:29:04,380
I'm looking at what they have for the weeks ahead and I'm like oh

1448
02:29:04,700 --> 02:29:06,300
oh

1449
02:29:08,220 --> 02:29:15,660
Hades oh Hades I need to buy it but yes because I'm like I don't want to play call the lamb again

1450
02:29:15,660 --> 02:29:21,180
but people have said that call the lamb is like Hades so yes I'll get Hades I'll buy Hades

1451
02:29:21,180 --> 02:29:29,260
because I know they have been paid as I'm poor I don't know I'm living off tuna fish and rice

1452
02:29:30,060 --> 02:29:38,140
and many friends will do that on Saturday I'm going to beat scrawny for overlapping with me every day

1453
02:29:40,460 --> 02:29:44,620
I'm looking at the schedule I'm like scrawny please give me a chance

1454
02:29:47,100 --> 02:29:49,580
oh okay let me just fucking

1455
02:29:50,460 --> 02:29:50,780
he

1456
02:29:53,740 --> 02:30:02,940
Hades facade oh my god I fucking love facade not scrawny stop stealing my viewers I'm like scrawny

1457
02:30:04,620 --> 02:30:07,420
let your viewers come watch me because I know they like me too

1458
02:30:10,220 --> 02:30:14,700
what does it doesn't really matter in the end as long as as long as we alert successful is all I care

1459
02:30:14,700 --> 02:30:17,260
about

1460
02:30:37,260 --> 02:30:42,940
actually no because she's I'm gonna I'm gonna do that one a little bit later because that's

1461
02:30:42,940 --> 02:30:46,780
a membership stream and I don't like overlapping with membership streams I don't want to force people

1462
02:30:46,780 --> 02:30:48,140
to choose I don't like that

1463
02:30:52,940 --> 02:30:57,500
the fair because she overlaps everyone you're not wrong mercy's the only one that doesn't get

1464
02:30:57,500 --> 02:31:01,100
overlapped but sometimes she does and it's hilarious to me

1465
02:31:04,300 --> 02:31:08,540
she's already streams 12 hours every day it's more than a full-time job she's doing overtime

1466
02:31:09,260 --> 02:31:15,340
consider it mad up yeah I try not I don't like overlapping but I end up doing it myself because

1467
02:31:15,340 --> 02:31:18,620
we are just the overlap corpo because we just love hanging out with our fan bases

1468
02:31:19,660 --> 02:31:26,060
okay then so did I give myself sunday off I don't know

1469
02:31:27,820 --> 02:31:32,460
again I might like a lot of like the days off I can't see me I'm doing air quotes but the days

1470
02:31:32,460 --> 02:31:38,540
off like I'll usually just do a unless I have like some pressing errands to do I'll usually just

1471
02:31:39,340 --> 02:31:46,140
do a um a gorilla stream a gorilla stream

1472
02:31:49,740 --> 02:31:53,420
I do feel like there's quite a distinction between fan bases like not that many watch all

1473
02:31:53,420 --> 02:32:00,380
oh I would have to disagree with you I um I have to disagree because I feel like

1474
02:32:00,380 --> 02:32:05,580
yes there's there's definitely like fans that are like die hard like oh my god they're my oh

1475
02:32:05,580 --> 02:32:09,980
gee but then I think there's people that are like you know I don't mind watching scrawny and then

1476
02:32:09,980 --> 02:32:16,300
she be and then I see and then you know get cozy with the zura and then blah blah blah you know

1477
02:32:18,460 --> 02:32:24,220
so I I have to disagree with up I have to disagree all right I think that's good

1478
02:32:26,060 --> 02:32:29,740
probably we'll do a girl in the morning on Thursday and probably we'll do a girl on sunday

1479
02:32:29,740 --> 02:32:35,180
but who knows maybe I won't feel like it maybe I'll be dying my body has been hurting me lightly

1480
02:32:36,140 --> 02:32:38,620
I've got a five bro flare up and I don't know why
