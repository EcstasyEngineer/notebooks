1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Stream, Snape, Shavey and I, because I have good English.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm ready when you are, no longer saying anything offensive.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
That's not always too cool.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
That'll never stop me.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Can't stop me. Ignorance.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Oh wait, I think it's funny because my stream has been started so this will probably show up.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Right, okay, I'm live too.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm live.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It takes like 30 seconds for it to register.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So I would say hi to Vod.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I don't know what's happening.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's like, it's not letting me type in my own chat.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You've done it now.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Am I banned from my own chat?

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Let me go look at your chat as well.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I graduated live.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
This is if we're doing it.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Imagine a company did that.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:10,000
They're just like, hey, I'm going to have you collide with everybody and then like a manager and like a PNG shows up and they're like, I'm sorry, you're gone.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
That has to have happened behind the scenes.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And like that feature has just been too polite to say anything about what happened.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I got signed on my YouTube channel.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I can't fucking comment on your stream.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
What?

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Wait.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Oh my god.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I got signed on my YouTube channel.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I can't pin my fucking...

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Is that what happened?

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Did I get sent out of my YouTube?

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Hold on a minute.

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm trying to be a lawyer.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm trying to be a lawyer.

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Hold on.

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I can't just hit the...

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I can't hit the YouTube.

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I suck at it.

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I was like, I was...

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
This is the kind of type of jokes we're making all day of day.

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
No.

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
She started it.

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I woke up and the first thing she sends me is a freaking Skippity 9-11 meme.

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm like, fuck's sake.

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
What am I supposed to do with that?

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Wait, it's me.

46
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Wait, it's me.

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Hold on.

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm still...

49
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It says error try again.

50
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Hold on.

51
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Hold on.

52
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm getting your YouTube.

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Help.

54
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm getting your YouTube password.

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I can't talk away on chat.

56
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
We're just...

59
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
No, don't add me yet.

60
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm not even putting that last fucking stream in the game.

61
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm not putting down my stream name yet.

62
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Stop.

63
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Am I live?

64
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm live.

65
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yeah, you're live.

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm also live.

67
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm getting your YouTube password.

68
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm hacking into the mainframe.

69
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I can't even message on your channel.

70
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
No, no, no.

71
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's because we've been signed up.

72
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Fucking...

73
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
YouTube does this.

74
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's like randomly signed up.

75
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Wait, how am I still streaming?

76
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
No, you can...

77
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So you can be signed out on OBS that still let you in, if that makes sense?

78
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Oh, okay.

79
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
But it's showing that I'm not signed out.

80
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I still have my thingy.

81
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I mean...

82
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
What's happening?

83
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Why can't I type in my chat?

84
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Is this like an OBS tape in your chat or on YouTube type in your chat?

85
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
YouTube type in my chat.

86
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Right.

87
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You've been signed out.

88
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
That's why you just...

89
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Okay, I give up.

90
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Sorry, guys.

91
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I cannot say hi.

92
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
No, it wasn't...

93
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
No, no, no.

94
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
That's where to park in the mainframe.

95
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Hold on.

96
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It wasn't a laughter dead 2 DLC.

97
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I was talking about VTube Studio, by the way, guys.

98
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Not that.

99
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
How do I join your game?

100
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The love of God.

101
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Do not show this on stream.

102
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
For the love of God.

103
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Oh, wait.

104
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm going to just spawn over it.

105
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
There you go.

106
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Don't fucking show them.

107
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
That's your password again.

108
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And then I'm deleting it once you're in.

109
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You're now a standard moderator.

110
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm not even signed in.

111
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I said I'm a standard moderator in your chat when I'm not signed in.

112
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I can't believe it.

113
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Signed out.

114
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Sinking is passed.

115
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Good morning, reflings and harem.

116
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
How is it going?

117
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
What the hell?

118
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Started any worse.

119
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
But we got there.

120
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm in.

121
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Right.

122
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm in.

123
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I can chat.

124
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Do you hear this error?

125
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Oh, my God.

126
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Wait, did YouTube just shit the bit?

127
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000

231
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:22,640
Okay for the uninitiated harem on the uninitiated reflakes I

232
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:30,080
Stony cuttles have a steam account which you can stream snipe and add me on okay

233
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,600
the addition is

234
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:39,280
Strony snipes now if you don't have my POV up because you're on a she be side

235
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,280
I'm showing it on screen right now

236
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:49,640
But it's Strony snipes. So what the agenda nation is and I have pieces of paper if you've never done stream sniping

237
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,960
But with me before I have a piece of paper where I write down who's played with us

238
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:58,160
And who's not and we work on an honor system where you do not play if you have a chance to play

239
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:06,040
You do not join until we do the reuse system where we read you again. So the train continues. We continue to train you

240
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,640
So you can add me on this account the truth of the matter the fact of the matters

241
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:21,160
I have never played Left 4 Dead 2 before she be has so we're gonna play some campaign mode

242
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:27,280
And then I have been heavily heavily heavily recommended to play a game mode

243
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,520
Which is 4v4 zombies versus survivors?

244
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,240
and

245
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:37,200
So, yes, oh, I didn't even know that was a game mode

246
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:43,840
Well apparently it's the most popular thing and we can get six reflakes in here a minute at a time

247
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:48,840
And oh cuz I've never played this game before I'm killing all of you just kidding

248
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:54,240
Oh, this is gonna be I'm gonna get my ass handed to me. This is this is Dom loss. I can't

249
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,920
This goes against my nature

250
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,480
Management you've been suspended

251
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,760

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:11,360
No, it's like could you've been suspended because you're doing the opposite of your lord? Oh, I was like

253
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,840

Use voice communication

259
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:50,120
That's right, I'll catch us in the game. Then we're right. So we can only play with

260
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:57,080
Play campaign place there a corporate of campaign online. Am I hosting that do you want hype? No, you can hold

261
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:02,520
I think you might host it cuz you have the bear. Oh wait, I do you have the ethernet cable and yes or no

262
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:06,680

00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:20,960
Play online with friends search for game. No, it's creating a new

265
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:28,520
Difficulty let's it's the first time I played the game before anyone starts chance shite and

266
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,160
Because I'm putting it on I should just lie and say this is my first

267
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:44,080
Okay, wait, why is it not just want to make sure you're aware of sprays might be smart to make sure that's disabled

268
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:49,720
Oh, are people gonna do like sprays and they're all just like no not the cod lobby sprays

269
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,160
Wait, you can like custom make your own spray. I don't know that

270
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:01,800

271
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,400
Please don't come to my house

272
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:15,840

273
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,960
You're suspended

274
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,800
Somebody stop talking about suspensions. I can't handle it

275
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:31,040
I'm getting nervous. We don't have to use voice chat. No, you're not forced to use watch up

276
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:35,600
But you can say hi if you want right don't snipe the slots because she be needs to come in

277
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:41,320
Right, how'd I get you in? Well, why don't you just hide your screen for a second and then I can join

278
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,880
well

279
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,880
I don't think I don't like every phone

280
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,760
Yeah, but

281
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,840
I'm trying to get that chat so I could see both chats

00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:07,560
Can let me open up her stream so I can read both channels at the same time

Okay, I got I need a third fucking display, but I don't have enough room. Um, you invited me

287
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,000

288
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,680
Oh, hey, there's a see there's a harem in here. I knew someone would sneak in

289
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,600

Right and then not Leviathan and then I write down the name

293
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:47,080
So then on the honor system next time when it comes to people that can join right just start game

294
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,760

295
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,000
What's my push to talk button? I don't know

296
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,400

00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,800
Did I tell you you have a second background music technically?

300
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:13,080
What is the first one the first one I got you came out?

301
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,800
Not correct for you

302
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,760
No, what is it?

303
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:22,280
Uh, I can send it. Yeah after stream if you want. Yeah, what the hell

304
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:29,560
I got it concepted it was still based after sonic heroes, but I had whistling in it and it was like no no whistles

305
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:34,440
No, that's me. So then I just completely got it read on to your current one

306
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,480
Uh, because it did not fit you at all

307
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:42,680
But that was on me because your design wasn't finished yet and I went ahead and ordered the background music

308
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,080
No, okay

309
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,720

Ah, oh sorry

Reloading uh, why doesn't say I'm protecting you when I'm clearly like somebody attacks me and you

702
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:30,840
But you just happen to shoot me at the same time

703
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:41,720
Wait, the zombies are fighting each other. I want to read. Look at these. They have really nice, uh, mannequins

704
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,920
Oh, just getting distracted

705
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:51,880
We appear to be in what is known as a shopping mall a shopping mall

706
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:56,200
A shopping mall. Look at that. They've got escalators. That's when you know

707
00:58:56,200 --> 00:59:01,480
They mean business when it's got big escalators. That's when it's a big business when you get escalators

708
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,800
Is uh

709
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:07,800
How is it called? Um

710
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,800
I heard there's like loads of abandoned

711
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:15,880
Moles in america now because like no one has money. Nobody. Yeah, nobody goes. Everybody's online. They just shop online too

712
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:18,680
Ah

713
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:23,880
Where are you? Oh, you're right next to me

714
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:30,680
I'm like trying so hard right now. I'm enjoying this. This is a good game. Yeah, it's pretty fun

715
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:35,480
Uh, I'll be very interested to see how this 4v4 thing goes

716
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:38,280
As I said, we're not going to do too much cam

717
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:43,240
Pain, I don't know if the campaign's like can I come under?

718
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,280
Yes, you can come under

719
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:51,880
Three two one go

720
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:57,960
I'm kidding. I'm teasing. I'm teasing. I'm teasing for a pleasing. Okay

721
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:05,080
I cannot scratch my eye. My eye is wondering what's happening to me

722
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:08,120
I'm gonna brought her to tears

723
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:10,280
I've been

724
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:12,360
Proof that I'm abusing

725
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:14,920
I've been abused

726
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:17,800
Hell

727
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,880
Oh, I got a piece of cat here in my eye

728
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:23,960
I'm blind

729
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:27,240
If I was playing this alone, I have to admit I'd be absolutely terrified right now

730
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:31,480
But I'm actually doing really good. Oh, I get terrified playing on my own like

731
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:33,000
Uh

732
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:39,160
In elden ring like I've finished it now the reef lens like streamsnake me and hold my hand the entire way

733
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:45,880
Because I get too terrified to play on my own like I get so scared. I can't spawn them in after a boss fight. That's so funny

734
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:52,440
I just what did you how far did you get? Did you get to the dlc? Yeah, we did everything together

735
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:56,040
Yeah

736
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:58,360
Stand there

737
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:03,000
I mean I commentate on their face. They do really well

738
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:07,160
That's so funny me who took like two hours to fight a boss the other day

739
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:09,800
Oh, no, no, I just

740
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:12,280
We just um because I'm so stubborn

741
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:15,080
And they're like no, no, but I'm like, no

742
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:21,960
You play it how they want to play it. There's someone crying. Can we rescue humans in this game? No, that's the witch

743
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:23,800
That's the witch

744
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:26,120
My human that is not a human that

745
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,360
I got her

746
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:35,240
I thought we could save humans. I was like, oh, maybe there's more

747
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:38,680
And that's how they trick you

748
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:40,920
They got me

749
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Is there any like

750
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:48,360
No, you play it the right way like uh, I saw the monkey game and I thought oh, you'd like that

751
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:54,920
Cause it's like same kind of style and like you're like a proper gamer though. I am not a proper gamer

752
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,600
You're a proper gamer for certain games. You just don't like souls likes

753
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:03,080
I just they're like, oh, are you gonna play like the

754
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:08,280
Uh, what is dark souls 3 or something like that the most like well recommended one

755
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:12,520
And I'm like, well, if you can't carry my hand through I'm a bit useless

756
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:17,160
Andy'd probably be more scared because I feel like dark souls 3 is a little bit more scary

757
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:26,040
No, like I get frustrated fast as well. Like if it doesn't go my way. I'm raging. I'm like, no, you rage quit

758
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:35,320
No, literally like I have to purposely plan around games that I know I can complete or not going to frustrate me because I played this old childhood game called

759
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:39,960
Blinks and I was fucking screaming at it. I was not having it

760
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:42,760
Rage it

761
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:50,120
I also rage at elden ring. Sometimes I have to be like I have to take a step away because otherwise

762
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:53,640
I was smashing my controller the other day

763
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:57,560
She uh, clip it and ship it boys

764
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:06,120
By the way, uh, I went and investigated. I was like, actually, yeah, I have sent these fucking shorts away like ages ago. What's going on? Yeah

765
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:09,080
Oh, sorry, sorry

766
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:11,960
You can melee them to

767
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:15,160
death

768
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:17,560
What is going on

769
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:21,400
There's too much. I need space to shoot. I need space to shoot. Can I say

770
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,400
I'm legally blind

771
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:27,480
I'll take that

772
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:31,880
Every schema behavior

773
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:35,960
There you go

774
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:40,440
I have no idea. I'm following them. I swiped it multiple times. So that's a controller. Yeah

775
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:47,560
Because I had a one controller that was already broken. I kept it around specifically so I could break it further when I get

776
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:48,920
Oh

777
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:50,680
honestly

778
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:54,520
There's a dwindle in if you would like it. I have some a dwindle in

779
01:03:55,800 --> 01:04:01,320
Whoa, there's chippies. You got some laze. You got some cheetos

Some candy

782
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:11,740
I'm out. Oh dry. I'm back to a pistol

783
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:16,680

01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:42,360
I'm being ridden and not on my strip

790
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:47,640
Where's the fire alarm

791
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:51,560
Wait, you turn it off. You know, you have to turn it off. Yeah

792
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:56,600
And they just keep coming if we don't get up in time, but I'm going I'm running

01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:45,480

I don't even know how i'm doing this so well to be honest

936
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:03,240
Maybe because I put it on easy mode. Who said that?

937
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:08,440
Who said I did not this is legendary modes. What are you talking about?

938
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:15,320
This is legendary. Let's get in the car. I'm stuck. I'm stuck. I'm literally stuck

939
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:19,640
Cussing we got cussing

940
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:22,680

I love games that credit you. Oh my god. Damn right. I'm coach. Mmm. Pippin number of times

945
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:48,520
The first aid kits use

01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:03,240
This is zero everything gang. Yeah, I didn't realize

947
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:06,200
It wouldn't like counting or something

948
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:09,640
Do like blues brothers and drive around the mall honestly

949
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:12,200
Common infected kill

950
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:16,360
Kill the most affected shrani with four 10

951
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:20,120
We're gonna be at the top of the lobby all the time. We'll do one more

952
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:28,280
And then we'll do that four v four game mode whatever it is. I have no idea what it involves, but we're gonna do it

953
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:30,760
We're gonna do it. Let's do it

954
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:35,720
707 zombies were harmed in the making of this good number. Stop. I love this game

955
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:41,080
Well, this is no wonder it's so well received. This is like such a good game

956
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:47,000
Right, so edit game sentence is that changed the map chapter?

957
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:51,160
Wait, we could do the campaign in one day

958
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:54,440
Hmm

959
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:57,000
Tempting

960
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:02,440
But how much time do you have my darling she be girl? I got nothing going on. I'm gonna go get some more water

961
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:05,160
Actually, hold on. I need to feed my cat

962
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:07,320
Yes

963
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:10,680
Because the thing went off 20 minutes ago

964
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:14,360
Wait, it's a different map. Oh, oh wait, hold on

965
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:16,920
Leave the lobby

966
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:19,560
Play campaign

967
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:21,560
Play with pals

968
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:26,760
Great of lobby but not that. Oh, no, we cannot complete the campaign

969
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:29,240
There's too much

970
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:32,840
I don't have much. We ain't doing campaign. We'll do this

971
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:34,840
I can't hear where before

972
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:54,280
Why is the floor sticky surprise I was over air

973
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:56,280
I

974
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:03,000
Please play no mercy. Oh, I was gonna do it in order

975
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:06,200
I think what I'll do is I'll play one more campaign

976
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:11,000
For this stream snip and then we'll do the 4v4 game mode just for the rest for the shits and giggles

977
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:13,480
And then I'll play the campaign

978

We'll do the campaign together because I thoroughly enjoy this game. I'm enjoying it

980
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:25,000
I did not realize how good it was like this is 10 out of 10

981
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,960

997
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:14,200
Right, no one come in

1010
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:14,120
He he he you peeler allegation and I can't believe I have to unironically message a talent and say hey

1011
01:22:14,120 --> 01:22:17,640
Have you peed on an audio yet for your donut's on reward?

1012
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:20,840

01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:43,720
Can you hear me? I can't hear anything

1018
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:47,720
Mummy next time you can just change the campaign in the lobby. Oh

1019
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:55,560
I'm gonna give it a shot offline to see if I'll be able to play it or not. I'm not sure though

1020
01:22:56,920 --> 01:23:01,560
Sorry for taking she be spot early about no, don't actually be sorry. I'm not actually mad

1021
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:07,160
It's just because I know she be needs to come in but if people are trying to stream snipe the slot before I can even get

1022
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:09,160
She be in I'm like

1023
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:13,960
Give me a moment. Um as for my lovely reeflings. Um

1024
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:19,560
Sorry here. Um, I know you're lurking in the shadows. I apologize. Um

1025
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:24,840
I will most likely play left for dead campaign with the reeflings

1026
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:28,360
So you guys can stream snipe me for the campaign and we'll have some shenanigans afterwards

1027
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:31,720
I'm not going to ask she be of too much time. However, um

1028
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:41,080
Because uh, she's working on her finalizing the donut on and we're we're getting some, you know assets and all that trash, you know

1029
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:43,080
it is

1030
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:46,760
So I'm not going to ask too much time

1031
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:51,400
Do I count down from win to enter? Yeah, three

1032
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:54,120

You're almost the lead to enter

1036
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:06,760
Zero you can come and the lobby

1037
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:08,760

1040
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:24,040
Um, we're literally playing easy mode because I've never played this game before but can I just say

1041
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:29,640
For when did this game come out? I'm pleasantly surprised

1042
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:32,440
um

1043
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:40,200
how like how good it feels like the guns feel nice the weaponry feels nice and it doesn't feel

1044
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:47,400
overwhelming the audio cues are fantastically placed like fantastically played this is lovely

1045
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:57,160
game 2009 okay this i'ma say it this game i might rank it a 10 out of 10 already like it's so fair

1046
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:07,560
and it's so like considerate to the player if you want and there's medical supplies where you

1047
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:14,120
need them just i think this is a fucking well rounded polished game and i don't know how long

1048
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:24,840
development was i wouldn't mind but yeah this is really good and really really good i know it was

1052
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:50,280
development was one year they put this together in a year the mechanics are easy to pick up the gun

1053
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:57,960
play is great and it switches up um tanks oh it switches up thanks to the director yeah leford ed

1098
01:30:58,280 --> 01:31:04,920
to me so he purred a lot um his name is bean little bean um and he was attached to me at the hip

1099
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:09,480
so he used to purr and he was at the vet but he was purring every time i interacted with him

1100
01:31:09,480 --> 01:31:14,520
and then he got a thermometer shoved up you know where and then he burst out purring even louder

1101
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:21,800
and i was like what's going on here like the vet started laughing as well because all of us were

1102
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:29,000
like staring at the cat like excuse you like who's obviously the vets are like oh the cat hates this

1103

1286
01:54:42,360 --> 01:54:50,200
for some reason that was very confusing oh it's called red flight to rubar cafe so i guess

1287
01:54:50,760 --> 01:54:58,840
yeah oh i felt like cs go lobbies right if we all shoot together right we could can the enemies

1288
01:54:58,840 --> 01:55:08,440
here isn't cs go oh no oh i thought we could like trash talk well technically in like lobbies yeah

1289
01:55:08,760 --> 01:55:14,840
okay um but because like you're against a team you usually can't hear the other team

1290
01:55:15,880 --> 01:55:20,920
yeah i forget there's no indian site i actually don't mean that there's no indian site in this game

1291
01:55:21,720 --> 01:55:27,160

1292
01:55:27,160 --> 01:55:34,760
made in source um and it's usually like you have to like crouch and like do your like weapon spray

1293
01:55:34,760 --> 01:55:40,600

1386
02:06:38,760 --> 02:06:44,760

1387
02:06:44,760 --> 02:06:49,080
and the camera isn't all focused then that's what gives her emotions like this

1409
02:08:59,160 --> 02:09:06,200
oh so the left for dead two takes off where the other team finished that's so cool we love continuity

1410
02:09:06,200 --> 02:09:12,360
in sequels with new players new battle wizard money gang we love sequels that are actually sequels

1411
02:09:13,960 --> 02:09:23,960
you'll need missing one person no we're not we are all here i think i think they're fourth

1414
02:09:43,400 --> 02:09:48,840
pray and do forgive us but sorry about that last sorry sorry it's just a bit of a misunderstanding

1419
02:10:14,680 --> 02:10:23,560

1420
02:10:24,520 --> 02:10:29,320
and i'm not sure don't be suspicious oh don't be the smoker

1421

good great question nick why doesn't anything have enough gas in it

1432
02:11:48,920 --> 02:11:55,080
oh thank you did you know that during a real zombie apocalypse that going for gasoline isn't

1433
02:11:55,080 --> 02:11:59,960
the smartest thing to do because it doesn't have good preservation yep there's no point

1434
02:11:59,960 --> 02:12:07,720
because it usually did you know that it's most likely that seeds will be a very high commodity

1435
02:12:07,720 --> 02:12:11,400
to grow your own food will become farmers again if a zombie apocalypse really happened

1436

no i prefer the assault rifle i'm in a assault rifle gal i'm in a assault rifle gal all right

1460
02:14:57,880 --> 02:15:07,000
i'll talk to these goofballs again okay hey i guess harder the more gas cans you get so you

1461
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:14,360
better see put them in just grab the cans and put them to the side okay the caller stays on until

1462
02:15:14,360 --> 02:15:22,760
mommy wins exactly that's right okay right i won't put any gas in the generator but we'll we'll get

1463
02:15:22,760 --> 02:15:31,160
our stocks up our stonks will be super duper high the highest stonks normally they're locked in with

1464
02:15:32,120 --> 02:15:37,320

02:15:59,640 --> 02:16:07,880
overwhelming okay there's that one all the way over here i can grab okay one two and then we just

1469
02:16:07,880 --> 02:16:16,280
put them all in it once that makes sense very gently right right that's a horde sound so i'm

1470
02:16:16,280 --> 02:16:23,480
going to purposefully stay behind with the npcs until the horde sound goes away because i'm not

1471

getting shagged for that why am i on fire because you're feeling hot hot hot you're so on fire

02:26:44,280 --> 02:26:51,160
got to get the pills too. Okay, I picked up ammo. I'm an assault rifle. We need four more cans. I'm

1554
02:26:51,160 --> 02:26:57,560
fine. I'm fine. Honestly, that didn't hurt that much. Okay, I'm gonna take adrenaline. Fuck it.

1555
02:27:00,920 --> 02:27:07,720
Wait, you actually shoved shit in your leg. Oh my god, something is going on really weird.

1556
02:27:07,720 --> 02:27:15,560
Right. Oh, I took adrenaline. I took a pill and I be saw. I didn't sometimes.

1557
02:27:16,280 --> 02:27:21,320
The NPCs will throw more stuff at us to help. I'm wishing they would throw something.

1558
02:27:21,320 --> 02:27:26,280
Can you guys throw down some like bombs? My adrenaline war off and I'm slow again.

1559
02:27:28,360 --> 02:27:33,880
And there's another horse. I can swing my sword to the heart. I'm taking.

1560
02:27:34,680 --> 02:27:38,600
Right. No, fuck you. Get back to the AI. Get back to the AI. Get back to the AI.

1561
02:27:38,600 --> 02:27:42,200
I'm just hanging out with the AI right now. I'm not going to lie. There's so many.

1562
02:27:42,840 --> 02:27:48,920
Can you make it replaying? Okay. I'm trying so hard. Okay, I'm back in range. I'm back in range.

1563
02:27:48,920 --> 02:27:55,640
I have a can. A smoker. So that didn't, we did good. Okay, we did good. There is a smoker. I don't know where

1564
02:27:56,200 --> 02:28:06,760
we. Okay, three more. Three more. Okay, I'm off. I got the high ground Anakin.

1565
02:28:09,560 --> 02:28:17,080
Oh, my nose is bulking. Why is it leaking? Hold on.

1566
02:28:17,400 --> 02:28:19,400
Oh, shit.

1567
02:28:32,760 --> 02:28:35,640
Okay, he's down. He's down. You need to find some help and take it.

1568
02:28:37,160 --> 02:28:41,960
No. Use me as cannon fodder. Right. I've got the next can.

1569
02:28:42,920 --> 02:28:45,320
I'm off. I'm going to follow your back.

1570
02:28:48,120 --> 02:28:52,360
I'm with the AI. No, no. Go with him. Go with him because I've got the AI covering me now.

1571
02:28:53,880 --> 02:28:58,040
Hurray! He has a can. He's got the can.

1572
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:09,800
Okay. Oh, charger. How did it get me? Okay. Help. Thank you.

1573
02:29:09,800 --> 02:29:18,440
I'm fucking gaming. Oh, I'm gaming so hard right now. One more. One freaking more and we're done.

1574
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:26,040
We never have to play this level again. Are you done healing? You see it across this fucking map?

1575
02:29:27,640 --> 02:29:33,160
I'm literally the very last one. Maybe we should, oh, maybe you should start with the far away ones.

1576
02:29:33,160 --> 02:29:37,640
Now that I think about it. Yeah, I'm getting closer. Oh, shit. Okay, we're doing okay. We're doing okay.

1577
02:29:38,440 --> 02:29:44,280
We're doing okay. We're locked in. Should we go for it? No, yeah. No, yeah. No, yeah. I don't know if it's over.

1578
02:29:44,280 --> 02:29:51,240
Oh, you're right. Oh, that's where that fucking thing was. I was trying to find that thing. Okay.

1579
02:29:52,440 --> 02:29:56,840
What? Oh, god. We didn't even get out before the next one came.

1580
02:29:57,800 --> 02:30:10,600
Oh. Oh, come on. Okay. Okay, boomer. Oh, I keep that. That's it. No, right. Fucking go. Move out. Move out.

1581
02:30:10,600 --> 02:30:17,080
Move out. No, don't move out. Don't move out. I'm right. I'm fine. Come to Main Street. Come to Main Street.

1582
02:30:17,080 --> 02:30:23,400
Come to Main Street. Main Street. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. Not right. Okay. It really is.

1583
02:30:23,480 --> 02:30:29,240
You need to take the one furthest away. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Okay. Remember,

1584
02:30:29,240 --> 02:30:36,200
we can shoot through each other. It's fine. I can't fucking see shit. Right. I'm getting it.

1585
02:30:36,200 --> 02:30:39,880
I'm getting it. I'm getting it. I've got it. I've got it. I've got it. I'm fucking beating up a zombie

1586
02:30:39,880 --> 02:30:44,680
with it. But I got it. It's fine. It's fine. I'm beating up everything. I'm making my way down.

1587
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:46,920
There's fire. Watch out. Oh, how?

1588
02:31:02,200 --> 02:31:06,120
I'm not playing this map again. I'm not playing again.

1589
02:31:07,080 --> 02:31:13,000
She just went up. No. I literally, I refuse to put your glory in.

1590
02:31:14,200 --> 02:31:21,080
I'm fine. I'm not playing this lower faster. Please don't make me the last one left.

1591
02:31:22,920 --> 02:31:28,120
Right. It's okay. It cannot come. It's small means cannot comprehend the chain link fence.

1592
02:31:29,160 --> 02:31:35,960
Okay. Okay. Oh, I'm being stopped on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

1593
02:31:35,960 --> 02:31:39,960
Hurry to the rescue vehicle. I would love to. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

1594
02:31:39,960 --> 02:31:43,560
I'm away. We're not playing this again. Yeah. We just got left.

1595
02:31:43,560 --> 02:31:49,560
What's wrong? He just left us. I left three dead.

1596
02:31:50,600 --> 02:31:54,360
Oh, literally. That was not. That was hot.

1597
02:31:59,320 --> 02:32:03,640
Don't die. The passing because we all died. Disease, disease, disease.

1598
02:32:06,040 --> 02:32:12,840
Oh, I was so sorry. The sole survivor. I'm not playing that map. That was awful.

1599
02:32:12,840 --> 02:32:16,600
Oh, that was horrible. That was so hard for no reason.

1600
02:32:18,920 --> 02:32:21,640
So, so hard. Stranny left for death.

1601
02:32:24,360 --> 02:32:27,560
Yeah. I didn't want to play that again. So honestly, thank God. Yeah.

1602
02:32:29,080 --> 02:32:34,360
You're actually playing this level again later. No. No. We're doing the 4v4.

1603
02:32:34,360 --> 02:32:39,960
We're doing the 4v4 shenanigans. I can right click to shove. I know. Will I use it? No.

1604
02:32:41,880 --> 02:32:47,160
Exactly. You tell him. No, we will now do the 4v4 thing. I don't know what it is.

1605
02:32:47,160 --> 02:32:51,480
So, you're going to have to tell me how to get into overall accuracy as if I have the highest

1606
02:32:51,480 --> 02:32:57,080
accuracy. Fifteen percent. Let's go. Do not believe that first thing.

1607
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:06,280
Wow. Awesome. Yes. Never ending. Did my game just crash? No. Okay. Right.

1608
02:33:07,240 --> 02:33:16,280
I just heard. And then that was it. Right. Okay. Let us analyze. So, if I want to do this 4v4 thing,

1609
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:23,880
I would like to... Bye, guys. Thanks for playing. Thank you very much for playing.

1610
02:33:25,080 --> 02:33:32,920
What? Verses? Verses. Verses. Play as a survivor infected in an online match. Okay.

1611
02:33:33,800 --> 02:33:40,920
Play with friends? Yes. Play on Steam group server? No. Play with friends.

1612
02:33:41,640 --> 02:33:47,320
Create a new Verses lobby. Okay. Left click to gun. Thanks, guys.

1613
02:33:52,760 --> 02:33:53,320
And then...

1614
02:33:59,080 --> 02:34:01,640
Wait. We stop you trying to win the campaign?

1615
02:34:03,960 --> 02:34:07,560
Yeah. We got to try to kill him. I want to be a zombie.

1616
02:34:08,520 --> 02:34:15,000
Server type. Official dedicate. Create lobby. Right. Don't bomb yet. Not until Sheepsters is in.

1617
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:18,520
That's not fair. Let Sheepsters come in. I said, don't bomb it.

1618
02:34:21,880 --> 02:34:28,680
Where are you? I'm in. Oh, okay. Right. Sheep is a little bomb. Right. And if you did play

1619
02:34:28,680 --> 02:34:34,280
previously, please don't do the honor system. Right. So, let me write down the names. No one special.

1620
02:34:35,240 --> 02:34:39,800
That's not a nice thing to call yourself. You're very special. I know. I thought that every time.

1621
02:34:39,800 --> 02:34:45,640
You need to be earful with your words because you'll start thinking it's true. If you put it

1622
02:34:45,640 --> 02:34:54,040
into existence, you'll start willing that. Okay. Noob, Lore, John, Omni, Battler.

1623
02:34:54,040 --> 02:34:55,720
Battler? Yeah, Battler.

1624
02:34:56,680 --> 02:34:59,400
She's like the bat.

1625
02:34:59,400 --> 02:35:04,200
Nihongo. Right. Okay.

1626
02:35:07,480 --> 02:35:11,720
Right. So, choose character.

1627
02:35:15,640 --> 02:35:20,520
Can you guys pick if you're the goodie or the baddie? Wait. What do you want me and Sheep?

1628
02:35:21,320 --> 02:35:29,240
I want to be a zombie. Right. I'm gonna pick coach. Put me in coach. Right. And then can you

1629
02:35:29,240 --> 02:35:35,640
guys choose character or don't you choose character for you? I can be infected. Okay.

1630
02:35:35,640 --> 02:35:43,880
If you select infected, you'll do that. Just do, I guess, random. You can pick a side.

1631
02:35:46,200 --> 02:35:49,640
And then whoever's left will get randomized, I assume, when we start the game.

1632
02:35:51,480 --> 02:35:54,600
Can I go for a very quick tinkle? I actually need a tinkle.

1633
02:35:55,880 --> 02:36:00,360
I'll keep you occupied. Give me uno momento, por favor.

1634
02:36:01,960 --> 02:36:03,560
Literally, my toilet's right there, so.

1635
02:36:06,120 --> 02:36:10,520
She just pees. It's like a little cuddle fish litter box.

1636
02:36:16,520 --> 02:36:18,360
I want to be quiet. I'm trying to hear Stronny P.

1637
02:36:20,760 --> 02:36:28,360
I don't hear anything. This is a bummer.

1638
02:36:31,400 --> 02:36:33,000
I can't wait to be a zombie.

1639
02:36:38,280 --> 02:36:39,160
You mean my mouth?

1640
02:36:41,720 --> 02:36:44,360
She be coming to get the hire links? Yep.

1641
02:36:45,400 --> 02:36:49,560
She be in Harlow's versus Stronny. You're really full. You guys watch both of us, so.

1642
02:36:51,480 --> 02:36:58,680
Sweet gaslight. No, you guys do that to me all the time. I hate it. It freaks me out.

1643
02:37:01,880 --> 02:37:06,760
So how are you guys doing? Hello, welcome in. We're playing Left 4 Dead. I'm sorry,

1644
02:37:06,760 --> 02:37:10,440
I'm a little bit quiet and low energy because of my head horde.

1645
02:37:14,120 --> 02:37:18,840
Exactly, boomie. I don't know if you guys heard boomie in the background just then.

1646
02:37:19,560 --> 02:37:21,000
Hi, what's up, boomie?

1647
02:37:25,720 --> 02:37:27,880
Well, my confirmed two steps ahead.

1648
02:37:28,600 --> 02:37:33,880
Hello, Mr. Boomer Team. Head improving at all? No, and I don't know why.

1649
02:37:36,040 --> 02:37:39,720
What's up, boomie? You're just here because there's food on my desk.

1650
02:37:40,440 --> 02:37:43,800
Boomie, try to steal my mozzarella sticks.

1651
02:37:44,680 --> 02:37:46,280
Boomie, you can't have this food.

1652
02:37:49,480 --> 02:37:53,160
Not to get political or anything, but the amount of piss that just came out of me.

1653
02:37:54,120 --> 02:37:57,400
I was trying to listen. I was listening real close.

1654
02:37:57,960 --> 02:38:04,040
You're not wearing. I was like, everybody's shh. We should be able to hear.

1655
02:38:04,840 --> 02:38:12,040
It's shocking. Right. What's the agendination?

1656
02:38:13,240 --> 02:38:14,680
The agendination?

1657
02:38:16,280 --> 02:38:20,360
I'm not beating the P.O. of the relegation. As soon as it does that, I'm dropping mine,

1658
02:38:20,360 --> 02:38:23,960
and then you can all, you can put a compilation of all our P's together.

1659
02:38:25,480 --> 02:38:30,440
And just listen to it on repeat. Instead of listening to like one hour of rain to put

1660
02:38:30,440 --> 02:38:34,440
yourself to sleep, it's just one hour of piss. Oh, that'd be a good idea.

1661
02:38:36,280 --> 02:38:42,600
Blue bar piss sounds. Come on. And we put it up as a freebie on everybody's Patreon. Come on.

1662
02:38:44,760 --> 02:38:48,120
Oh, no, you're actually not allowed to put on Patreon. You're allowed to put on YouTube,

1663
02:38:48,120 --> 02:38:53,400
strangely enough. Right. As soon as the hit start game is going to do the,

1664
02:38:53,400 --> 02:38:58,360
it's going to randomize the rest. So if the other snipers aren't bothered,

1665
02:38:58,360 --> 02:39:03,480
we'll just jump right into it and let's get started. Now, obviously,

1666
02:39:04,120 --> 02:39:07,720
first things first. Unexpectedly based. I'm so based.

1667
02:39:11,160 --> 02:39:16,040
So I'm going to make a remix of the audios, what you want to dance and listen to a song of our

1668
02:39:16,040 --> 02:39:24,040
tinkles getting. Oh, guess the piss. So you have to guess who's peeing.

1669
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:30,040
That's actually really funny. Who's piss is this?

1670
02:39:32,680 --> 02:39:35,960
How did the vain one that comes out of vain? If we do a real game show,

1671
02:39:35,960 --> 02:39:39,480
I'm fucking doing that kind of content. We're asking you guys about the content that all the

1672
02:39:39,480 --> 02:39:45,320
gen mates of me take. Can you identify whose tinkle this is?

1673
02:39:46,280 --> 02:39:50,600
That sounds like Frank chicken. That's definitely strong.

1674
02:39:52,520 --> 02:39:55,560
Damn, Frank chicken in there. Oh, no, seriously.

1675
02:39:59,400 --> 02:40:02,920
Okay, so I have me in the game. I have to choose a spawn location.

1676
02:40:04,600 --> 02:40:09,800
I don't. So you can come at me. Oh, this is fun.

1677
02:40:10,600 --> 02:40:13,400
Oh, boy.

1678
02:40:16,760 --> 02:40:24,040
So are you just like a regular schmagular zombie or sure you stream guest there.

1679
02:40:24,040 --> 02:40:27,560
Oh, wait, P you guess or stream. That's a good. Sorry, I messed up your thing.

1680
02:40:30,440 --> 02:40:32,200
I'm just coughing the entire time.

1681
02:40:32,200 --> 02:40:36,920
Oh, why do I cough so much?

1682
02:40:39,240 --> 02:40:42,760
I can hear them. They're making they're like coming for you.

1683
02:40:43,960 --> 02:40:50,680
Oh, yeah, actually. I'm Friday. How can I tell who it is? Just when the NPCness stops, I guess.

1684
02:40:52,760 --> 02:40:57,320
I can't walk through this. Oh, I think it's a wall. Come closer.

1685
02:40:57,320 --> 02:41:00,040
I can literally hear something grumbling in the woods.

1686
02:41:00,760 --> 02:41:05,640
Is that you, Shibi? Are you lurking around? No. Are you grumbling?

1687
02:41:07,720 --> 02:41:10,280
I hear it. Oh, oh.

1688
02:41:13,080 --> 02:41:21,160
Oh, so you have to please specialize zombies against us. Oh, my God. Oh, I died. Dang it.

1689
02:41:21,720 --> 02:41:27,400
What? Oh, my God. Killed a sheebie. Yeah, I like this. This is so good.

1690
02:41:28,600 --> 02:41:31,960
Right. It's fun. I just grabbed you with my little tongue.

1691
02:41:35,720 --> 02:41:37,800
Grabbing harlots with your tongue. Are you?

1692
02:41:43,720 --> 02:41:48,200
I love that we can stick our tongues out on our muscles. Oh, gosh, what did I spawn as?

1693
02:41:49,080 --> 02:41:53,560
Oh, is that like randomized zombie spawn as well? Yeah, it seems so.

1694
02:41:56,360 --> 02:42:02,280
I can't spot. I'm getting on me. I don't know what it is, but knock it off. I can't see anything.

1695
02:42:02,280 --> 02:42:05,080
I literally cannot see a damn thing. It's green.

1696
02:42:07,560 --> 02:42:11,880
Oh, I'm getting my ass beat. I'm getting my ass beat. Holy shit. I can climb stuff.

1697

What? I hate shotguns. Oh, someone got me. I love you. I died.

1698
02:42:23,320 --> 02:42:31,480
How we killed any of them? Well, I suppose it's not supposed to be balanced like MPC balance.

1699
02:42:31,480 --> 02:42:37,880
Who needs heels? I'm killing myself. Okay, we hate the Shrek vision. Honestly, welcome to

1702
02:42:59,080 --> 02:43:00,600
Can be seen by the survivors.

1703
02:43:00,600 --> 02:43:09,800
Oh, I see that. Who's that? Is that what he is? I got you. I saw you. I saw you creeping around.

1705
02:43:21,080 --> 02:43:27,480
How did I just die? I got killed in one hit. You have very low HP, but I suppose because

1706
02:43:27,480 --> 02:43:34,840
you can keep coming back to get us. Yeah, that's true. I can't see shit. I cannot see a single thing.

1707
02:43:35,400 --> 02:43:40,920
I'm just happy to be here. Honestly. This is really fun. Just like being an evil zombie.

1708
02:43:42,280 --> 02:43:48,120
Evil. I can't believe it. He's watching. Watching,

1709
02:43:50,680 --> 02:43:53,400

1710
02:43:53,400 --> 02:44:01,760
I don't know what you see, but I'll try I'll be in it. I'll be an evil zombie next one

1711
02:44:01,960 --> 02:44:03,960
Just so I can see what it looks like

1712
02:44:04,760 --> 02:44:11,920
No, I thought that was a real player. It was just a regular zombie. Ah, I hear you. Oh, no, I

1713
02:44:13,400 --> 02:44:21,360
Hear you I hear you I gotta get close to you. Oh no, I'm gonna die

Probably you're gonna hear me screaming in the next round

1761
02:48:51,520 --> 02:48:56,240
That's enough. Are we supposed to be able to like to kill you all at the same time and then we win

02:48:57,240 --> 02:49:02,400
Our health is definitely getting low like don't think you're not doing anything like we're getting fucked up over here

Get out literally we are so perfect nifty now we're

1772
02:49:56,280 --> 02:49:58,580
Hard to find a way to replace a spawn

02:53:00,760 --> 02:53:02,760
Stash and Hikaru

Here can be seen by survivors press primary attack charge. I'm getting killed by normal

1808
02:53:38,320 --> 02:53:40,320
or oh

1809
02:53:40,360 --> 02:53:42,360

Okay, I understand I am I comprehend what were to do

1811
02:53:56,000 --> 02:54:02,160
The trick is to use snipers really I feel like snipers are so hard to deal with

1812
02:54:02,760 --> 02:54:05,440
Well, probably just spot them from farther away

1813
02:54:07,280 --> 02:54:10,160
Just like there's not much in the chamber

1814
02:54:11,600 --> 02:54:14,640
All right, so I need to back away right, okay

1815

No, no, I knocked them down, but I never killed

1818
02:54:37,840 --> 02:54:43,040
I was like a little leap I'll go and left and right. I'm like yeah, my pink's protecting me. You can't shoot me

1819
02:54:45,560 --> 02:54:47,560

Oh my god, the lag is killing me

1828
02:56:01,520 --> 02:56:06,140
That boomers are quite hard to play I'm not sure they're the most effective. You literally just have to run

1829
02:56:08,280 --> 02:56:14,120
Play your your bomb gets on them. Yeah, no, don't worry friends. It's okay. Mommy's don't play

2183
03:36:05,720 --> 03:36:12,120

because i have a budget

2199
03:38:30,040 --> 03:38:34,120
that's a good portal that matches

2200
03:38:41,640 --> 03:38:43,080
my budget should be upon me

2201
03:38:56,680 --> 03:38:59,160
yeah a hundred dollars

2202
03:38:59,800 --> 03:39:00,120
okay

2203
03:39:03,160 --> 03:39:05,080
i'll say 200 is the budget

2204
03:39:08,280 --> 03:39:13,480
i have been saving for fias stuff i have quite a bit of money saved so that shouldn't be an issue

2205
03:39:15,000 --> 03:39:20,440
i was gonna pay off something but i didn't like uh i can wait i just make the normal payments

2206
03:39:21,560 --> 03:39:29,160
so i've been i won't lie to you i've been using that it's the the fanzly money is what

2207
03:39:29,160 --> 03:39:30,760
goes towards fias medical

2208
03:39:38,680 --> 03:39:42,440
so i'm like i'm hoaring myself out for my daughter

2209
03:39:44,920 --> 03:39:48,680
i'm dancing on the pole for my sick child

2210
03:39:49,640 --> 03:39:52,360
drunken it for vet bills

2211
03:39:57,160 --> 03:40:01,640
so that's what i use that for i literally i have not withdrawn any of the money it's just been

2212
03:40:01,640 --> 03:40:07,320
sitting there in my account because i'm not going to touch it unless i need it i haven't even put

2213
03:40:07,320 --> 03:40:17,480
it a payout option uh and then like yeah i can literally just like i'm very i'm not shy to talk

2214
03:40:17,480 --> 03:40:27,880
about um what my money goes to uh literally usually i can pay my rent thankfully with uh

2215
03:40:27,880 --> 03:40:35,640
the the tips from stream elements and then i pay my bills in groceries in like um everything with

2216
03:40:35,640 --> 03:40:51,240
patreon um so that's like a car payment car insurance my um what's it called my like electricity

2217
03:40:51,240 --> 03:40:57,000
internet and all that stuff home bill how she spent it on crustables a lot and then the rest of the

2218
03:40:57,000 --> 03:41:07,080
money i just spend on food and doorkash and then so the stream elements patreon

2219
03:41:09,320 --> 03:41:22,360
and then youtube membership i usually set aside for um for taxes i just usually i use i save one

2220
03:41:22,360 --> 03:41:35,720
payout for taxes because i don't want to evade taxes i know i do got to cut back the doorkash

2221
03:41:36,840 --> 03:41:44,520
um i also have a like an accountant in my family because um my dad used to own a business and my

2222
03:41:44,520 --> 03:41:53,640
mom um used to uh needed a personal accountant at one point for her own finances so it's kind of funny

2223
03:41:53,640 --> 03:41:59,880
because like i also wouldn't be able to hide what i do from my parents because like my parents are

2224
03:41:59,880 --> 03:42:03,320
very close to the accountant and they'll be like you know your daughter has poor money right now i

2225
03:42:03,320 --> 03:42:08,520
don't think you would say that um i have to reach out to him speaking of which maybe i'll reach out

2226
03:42:08,600 --> 03:42:14,520
to him tomorrow because i would like to get ahead on tax season uh because that is coming up

2227
03:42:14,520 --> 03:42:23,880
expeditiously i like to use the word expeditiously um i know i've done meal prepping before um

2228
03:42:25,160 --> 03:42:30,520
i have a lot of like throw away top aware stuff to like that i've got for meal prep

2229
03:42:31,240 --> 03:42:36,840
and like this is how i like i know like i used to never eat doorkash this much i used to never

2230
03:42:37,560 --> 03:42:41,480
so it's really i need to find a better routine i need to start eating better

2231
03:42:42,760 --> 03:42:48,120
because i need to um i need to put that freaking chair together as you guys got me it's sitting

2232
03:42:48,120 --> 03:42:53,400
in pieces on my porch and then the and then the the cushions are just stuffed in my closet

2233
03:42:53,400 --> 03:42:55,400
um

2234
03:42:58,120 --> 03:43:04,840
this guy you say yeah oh i'll literally like some of the donothon stuff like um one of the

2235
03:43:05,480 --> 03:43:13,640
goals is like me getting a pc and then i know saving to pay off my debt because i ringing up

2236
03:43:13,640 --> 03:43:20,760
um a lot of money in credit cards for my pat my personal past health bills from the past few years

2237
03:43:21,240 --> 03:43:27,160
um i'm really wishing i never put them on credit cards i wish i just kind of just never paid them

2238
03:43:27,160 --> 03:43:34,280
because then usually honestly like they'd never it goes to collections but nobody really does

2239
03:43:34,280 --> 03:43:38,600
any like it doesn't affect my credit at all but then if it's on my credit card and my credit card

2240
03:43:38,600 --> 03:43:46,360
is maxed out then yeah and then i took out a loan to pay off the credit card and then it got maxed

2241
03:43:46,520 --> 03:43:53,480
out again because fia it was me with my health issues and then it was fia because i had to go to

2242
03:43:53,480 --> 03:43:58,920
the hospital and i had to get tested i had to do this and that and now it's my sweet girl's turn

2243
03:44:02,120 --> 03:44:07,320
the interest pile is up yeah i was able to pay a little bit down but the interest i'd rather just

2244
03:44:07,320 --> 03:44:15,480
pay it off in one one foul swoop oh i don't care about collection companies my um one of my

2245
03:44:15,480 --> 03:44:20,680
co-workers for my former job um they used to be a tax collector and they said it was the most

2246
03:44:20,680 --> 03:44:26,200
horrible job they ever did because uh they had to like shake down an old woman for like

2247
03:44:27,400 --> 03:44:32,760
taxes from her dead husband and he's like i can't do that job and i'm like damn brother

2248
03:44:32,760 --> 03:44:39,400
Jesus christ um student loans oh good for you i also have student loans to pay but i generally

2249
03:44:39,400 --> 03:44:43,720
don't care about those i think i like i didn't finish school i only have like $12,000 in student

2250
03:44:43,720 --> 03:44:49,240

2251
03:44:49,240 --> 03:44:54,280
sitting there i don't care about those those i can worry about later um

2252
03:44:56,040 --> 03:45:01,000
what interest rate do i have in my card uh i can tell you right now i will literally tell you

2253
03:45:01,000 --> 03:45:08,040
how much i have in debt and how much i have an interest i do not give a shit uh a wallet it's

03:50:57,560 --> 03:51:05,560
job uh you have to make sure you go down the right avenues and everything um so even the

2307
03:51:05,960 --> 03:51:13,880
scared the IRS exactly uh i had a friend she's a baby his parents open credit yep exactly exactly

2308
03:51:13,880 --> 03:51:19,240
my friends have experienced that too so i'm very thankful that my parents didn't do that they never

2309
03:51:19,240 --> 03:51:26,040
they never ever did that um yeah my parents came from they were very very poor my parents were very

2310
03:51:26,040 --> 03:51:35,960
very poor um my my my parents worked very very very hard to get to me get me um to where i am

2311
03:51:36,840 --> 03:51:42,840
and they sacrificed a lot on my behalf so i will and that's why i'm like what i want to do

2312
03:51:44,040 --> 03:51:49,160
is like i want to be able to be successful enough that i can do what strani did and buy my parents

2313
03:51:49,160 --> 03:51:55,640
a house um because my parents were so happy when they came back from that trip my mom was like wow

2314
03:51:55,640 --> 03:52:00,680
i have never been on the beach and living on the beach like that would be the dream and i'm like

2315
03:52:00,680 --> 03:52:04,120
i'm just quietly giggling to myself because i'm like you know what one day i'm going to buy you a

2316
03:52:04,120 --> 03:52:11,560
beach house oh yeah single single mothers and single fathers they are they are superheroes

2317
03:52:11,560 --> 03:52:18,120
if you have a single parent that took uh good care of you then uh you should be make sure make

2318
03:52:18,120 --> 03:52:24,600
sure you pay that forward they're very your parents your parent is a superhero uh my freaking allergies

2319
03:52:24,600 --> 03:52:32,760
dude yeah um and it sucks because like i know some people don't have parents like that the

2320
03:52:32,760 --> 03:52:39,320
second set them up for success um and try to like look out for their best interests so i'm very

2321
03:52:39,320 --> 03:52:45,640
thankful for mine um but keep in mind like he doesn't have to be your family you can just rely on

2322
03:52:45,640 --> 03:52:49,880
you know they always say they always get the quote we're on uh they always say you know blood is

2323
03:52:49,960 --> 03:52:57,560
thicker than water but the it's actually um the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of

2324
03:52:57,560 --> 03:53:03,720
the womb so the the the lasting relationships you make that you bind yourself with other people

2325
03:53:03,720 --> 03:53:10,520
they're they're they're tighter bonds they can be tighter bonds than family um and that's why well

2326
03:53:10,520 --> 03:53:17,240
some of my uh like i don't have any siblings i don't have any close relatives to me it's literally me

04:00:02,720 --> 04:00:08,240
that pink algae stuff so I have to clean it pretty constantly I put in a filter

2382
04:00:08,240 --> 04:00:13,240
on my shower head but I think I have to do a new one because it's starting to

2386
04:00:30,600 --> 04:00:38,320
I would dress like pretty nice for work and stuff but I don't do that because I

2387
04:00:38,320 --> 04:00:43,680
don't go anywhere and so I don't dress as nice so I just been literally living in

2388
04:00:43,680 --> 04:00:49,720
t-shirts and panties for the last since June so I maybe I'll get some more

2389
04:00:49,720 --> 04:00:54,760
t-shirts and panties maybe I'm wondering if I should be like goth girl fall or

2390
04:00:54,760 --> 04:00:58,600
kawaii girl fall because then I'm like then I'll have a focus I'm like what

2391
04:00:58,600 --> 04:01:04,720
just said I do I want do I want to be goth or do I want to be kawaii desu I'm

2392
04:01:04,720 --> 04:01:09,600
debating maybe I'll have a poll because then if I'm it's if it's goth girl fall

2393
04:01:09,600 --> 04:01:13,360
then cuz then I'll just dress super alternatively and I'll take more
