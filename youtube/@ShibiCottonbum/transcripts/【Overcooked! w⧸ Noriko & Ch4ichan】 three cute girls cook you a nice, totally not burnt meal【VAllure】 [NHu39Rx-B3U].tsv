7357880	7358760	Wait, how can...
7358760	7361560	How is a southern accent racist?
7361560	7363400	It just brings out the best in me.
7365400	7366440	Oh, I see what you mean.
7366440	7367080	Like, it just...
7367080	7369000	The America just takes over.
7369000	7371080	Yeah, America, the fucking...
7372520	7373480	American, I mean.
7373480	7374120	Today!
7374920	7378920	Should we normalize Peter Griffin ASMR roleplay?
7378920	7379480	What?
7379480	7379800	What?
7381320	7381960	Peter!
7382920	7384440	Peter, I don't know why she's...
7385560	7386440	Hoss is here.
7388360	7390360	Chad, you should try Scottish.
7390360	7392120	Can you do a Scottish accent?
7392120	7392920	Yeah, do it, do it.
7393720	7394360	Me?
7394360	7394680	Yes.
7395400	7395800	Thank you.
7397800	7400040	Whoa, whoa, whoa, scrolling!
7404280	7405480	Just scrolling!
7406680	7407800	Just scrolling!
7407800	7410200	Does it sound like just mimic Shrek?
7411720	7412520	Don't care!
7412520	7413720	Don't care!
7413720	7414760	Don't care!
7414760	7417160	What are you doing in my swamp?
7418120	7419320	Yeah, I'm not swamped.
7419320	7419800	Or...
7419800	7420440	Or...
7420440	7422360	Let's go daddy to Pullman get some...
7423880	7424760	tall points.
7425480	7425960	That's right.
7425960	7426520	Yeah, that's right.
7426520	7427720	Kind of blends...
7427720	7429640	Yeah, yeah, I always slip into British
7429640	7431480	when I try to do Australian or Scottish.
7431480	7433720	The Yankee, isn't Yankee like the...
7434680	7435000	the...
7435800	7436840	New York.
7436840	7437880	Yeah, yeah, East Coast.
7437880	7439160	And walk in here.
7440200	7442360	I'm walking in, I'm walking in!
7442360	7444200	Yeah, wait me!
7445400	7447080	They need to turn into Australia?
7447880	7449560	It just keeps going back?
7449560	7451000	I can't control it!
7451000	7454200	Say optimize my performance in a British accent.
7455000	7455800	What?
7455800	7456680	Optimize...
7458840	7461560	Optimize my performance.
7461560	7464120	Optimize my performance.
7464120	7466040	Optimize my performance.
7466040	7467640	Oh, mommy, sweet Jesus.
7467640	7468520	If I...
7468520	7470600	If I was a boy, if I was a boy,
7470600	7472760	my weenie would be very wrecked.
7472760	7474520	It's a really stigma card, you.
7475320	7476680	My clip just jumped.
7477880	7479880	This is really deactivating you.
7479880	7481800	I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
7481800	7483000	What does that even mean?
7485000	7486280	Is this German accent?
7487480	7488120	I can't do it.
7488120	7489560	I can't do German.
7489560	7490360	I think I can do it.
7490360	7492200	I think I really have to focus,
7492200	7493800	and then it comes out.
7493800	7496200	It's like out of my control sometimes.
7496200	7500040	Who can make the most racist accent challenge?
7500040	7500680	I got you.
7500680	7501880	Probably Nori.
7501880	7503000	Probably Nori.
7503000	7503640	Right.
7504840	7505320	Actually...
7505320	7506280	I definitely can.
7507000	7507960	Southern...
7507960	7509960	Dad, I'm down in Texas today.
7510440	7511880	All right, that's pretty good.
7511880	7513320	I'm gonna get in my truck,
7513320	7516200	and I'm gonna go get some guns.
7516200	7517320	You're gonna get some guns?
7517320	7518040	I love Americans.
7518040	7519640	I love me and my guns.
7519640	7521000	I love being American.
7521000	7523960	My first amendment right is my pistol whipping guns.
7525160	7526440	I have a large gun point.
7526440	7527640	You know the Capitol.
7527640	7528040	Choo!
7528040	7531160	Yeah, let's go raid the Capitol.
7531160	7532040	No, no, Tommy.
7532040	7533000	Let's go storm that Capitol building.
7533000	7534280	Let's go storm that Capitol building.
7534280	7535560	Oh, yeah, let...
7535560	7536920	Yee-haw, let's do that.
7537560	7538280	Yeah, let's do that.
7538280	7539160	What gun would I use?
7539160	7542360	I would use an AK-47 or a military-grade gun.
7542360	7543240	I'll tell you what.
7543800	7544520	I'll tell you what.
7544520	7544920	I'll tell you what.
7544920	7546120	I'll tell you what.
7546120	7547080	I'll tell you what.
7547080	7549480	I'll use a goddamn military-grade gun
7549480	7551880	if I have to shoot down the goddamn...
7551880	7552600	Games?
7552600	7554520	Yeah, shoot down the range.
7555880	7558280	Take advantage of the second amendment.
7558280	7560360	I love taking advantage of the second amendment.
7561480	7562680	What's the second amendment?
7563560	7564840	I think it's like guns.
7564840	7567160	I think it's the right to bear arms.
7567160	7568360	No, America.
7568360	7569560	I love eagles.
7569560	7570680	I love eagles.
7570680	7572120	Well, I love eagles and I love...
7572120	7572840	It's my sister.
7572840	7573960	What's that kilometer?
7573960	7575800	I don't know American freedom units.
7576760	7577800	Artificial flavors.
7578360	7580280	Artificial flavors.
7581480	7582280	I'll go Alabama.
7582840	7584760	I'll go Alabama if she be right now.
7584760	7586280	I'll tell you what right now.
7586280	7587080	I love my mother.
7588120	7590200	K-Y-S, which means kiss your sister.
7590200	7591560	Don't mind if I fucking do.
7592360	7594440	I'll true, I'll true that.
7594440	7595880	True that, true that.
7596600	7597880	Someone asked in your chat,
7597880	7600280	what D&D race and class would you all play?
7602520	7603720	Necromancer.
7603720	7606200	And I'd be like the smallest class ever.
7606200	7608120	So a half-foot or a dwarf.
7608120	7609560	But I'd be a necromancer.
7610200	7611880	I was also going to say necromancer
7611880	7613160	and I'd probably just be an elf.
7614200	7615640	Wait, what's the question?
7616280	7618760	Oh, what D&D class and race would you be?
7619480	7623080	Oh, I would be a dark elf rogue.
7623960	7625480	I totally see that, yeah.
7625480	7626280	Gonna be black?
7627640	7628600	Are you black?
7628600	7629880	I think we've already established
7629880	7631960	that Chai has wanted to be black this entire stream.
7631960	7633640	Oh my god, he's not swear.
7633640	7634680	He loves you so much.
7634680	7637160	Chai wants to race mix.
7637800	7639400	It's a coincidence, it's a coincidence.
7639400	7641560	She wants to make many versions of me.
7641560	7644920	Ever since I was young, I felt like I was Japanese.
7648840	7649560	That's so true.
7649560	7652920	In every state but physical, I am Japanese.
7654280	7654520	Hi.
7654520	7655640	I represent Japanese.
7656360	7656680	Hi.
7658200	7658680	Hi.
7658680	7659080	I'm all level.
7659080	7659160	I'm all level.
7659160	7659320	I'm all level.
7659320	7659720	I'm all level.
7659720	7661320	You're so dead to your heart.
7661320	7662040	I am a wolf.
7666680	7669320	Is that the CbCottenbum and Chai?
7669320	7671560	Oh yeah, I guess I'm fucking Rico, I guess.
7671560	7672680	Fuck me, I guess, man.
7672680	7672920	Fuck.
7673560	7674360	Fuck the person.
7674360	7675560	Well, I don't know where to look.
7676280	7679160	Someone went inside the CbCottenbum and Chai.
7679160	7679640	Yeah, please.
7679640	7680840	Why is there two of me?
7682040	7683320	Oh, one more moment.
7684920	7685960	Why not two of you?
7686600	7688520	There was two of me for a second on my stream.
7689400	7692280	What would Chai look like if she was white or Chinese?
7692280	7693400	Well, she's white now.
7696520	7698120	No, no, no, they think I'm brown.
7698120	7698760	Keep it up, keep it up.
7698760	7699400	Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
7699400	7701800	This is what you would look like if you were white or Chinese.
7702520	7705480	Yeah, I only hang out with streamers that fake the rig.
7706520	7717800	Yeah, we're all beautiful, Aryan queens, blue eyes, blonde hair, pale, pale skin.
7717800	7720200	Like you can see our veins.
7723320	7727160	I'm actually pretty light-skinned, but you can see my veins and I get made fun of.
7728440	7731800	Now, I turn over my arm and my veins are like very matte.
7731800	7734920	People are like, good veins, little lady, your veins are so good.
7736280	7737480	That's when they draw your blood.
7737480	7738760	Do you have blue veins?
7738760	7739560	I have green.
7739560	7740600	I got blue and green.
7741480	7742200	Yeah, I have green.
7742200	7743480	Oh, wow, we got a mixture.
7743480	7744920	Maybe it's because I'm white and black.
7746040	7748200	Wow, that's all you're talking about.
7748200	7750440	You're a race, race mixer.
7750440	7751720	I'm a race mixer.
7751720	7759080	My parents, they, their loves surpassed race and segregation and they made me.
7760760	7762120	Disgusting, you're an abominant.
7763720	7764200	Oh, wait.
7764200	7765080	You're an abominant.
7765080	7768760	I'm so sorry, Chai.
7768760	7773880	What would you guys, okay, in like a casual way, like, what would animal do you most associate?
7773880	7775160	What's your spirit animal?
7775800	7777640	Oh, my, my hamster.
7778360	7779400	Hamster?
7779400	7784040	Yeah, because I think, I think hamsters die in the most obscure way.
7784040	7788600	So I feel like my owner would throw me at a wall and I would just go splat and like crumble and die.
7789800	7792040	I'd be like a pathetic excuse of a hamster.
7792040	7793160	I wouldn't be able to do anything.
7793800	7795400	So that's why it's your spirit animal.
7795400	7796760	Because they're pathetic.
7796760	7797560	Yeah, just like me.
7800840	7801720	What are you guys?
7801720	7802680	What are you guys guys?
7802680	7804280	I don't know what the fuck I was saying.
7805720	7807000	I'm just laughing too much.
7807000	7808200	I can't even answer.
7811320	7813240	Chibi thought she was the one who was edgy.
7813240	7816600	No, I know the moment I had, I was going to have Noria in my stream,
7816600	7819880	that you guys are going to fucking love her because how face she is.
7819880	7823240	And that's a great juxtaposition to Chai, who is so sweet.
7828680	7831800	You would think she'd be edgy with how she looks, but it's the pink one.
7831800	7833480	It's always the fucking pink one, isn't it?
7834280	7835880	It's always the fucking pink one.
7835880	7837560	It's always the fucking the pink woman.
7838760	7840280	Well, you're a purple woman.
7840280	7841960	I'm glad if you do.
7841960	7842520	Yeah.
7842520	7843160	No, I don't know.
7843160	7844120	I just think about it a lot.
7844120	7846760	Like if I was like, if I was a hamster, I would genuinely
7847320	7848440	I would genuinely die.
7848440	7848840	I don't know.
7848840	7851480	My owner would be too loud and I would just have a hard time.
7851480	7852120	I would just die.
7852120	7856120	My owner would bring a girl home and I'd kill myself like in my little cage or something.
7856120	7856440	I don't know.
7856440	7856920	Like I.
7856920	7857560	What?
7857560	7859000	What about you guys?
7859000	7859480	Dude?
7859480	7860040	Yeah, she knows this.
7860040	7861160	I want to pretend it.
7861160	7869480	I think on all levels, except physical, I'd be a wolf.
7869480	7871480	What?
7871480	7873320	I'm fucking a wolf.
7874280	7877720	I was a fucking role player for like 10 years.
7877720	7878680	I can't.
7878680	7879800	Wait, wait, yes.
7879800	7880520	I can't do that.
7880520	7881640	Yes, yes, yes.
7881640	7884840	Wait, I was a warrior cat's role player for so long.
7884840	7885880	Oh my god, no way.
7886760	7887240	Yes.
7887240	7889880	See, let's let it go.
7893400	7894840	Oh my gosh.
7894840	7896040	Can we start our own clan?
7896760	7897240	Yes.
7898040	7900680	I want to be Chai Pa or Chai Leaf.
7900680	7901560	I'm going to call you Chai Leaf.
7901560	7902680	That's actually really cute.
7903640	7906520	I guess I would be like cotton pick.
7906520	7907560	No, sorry.
7911080	7912680	I'll be cotton, cotton.
7913880	7915480	It's a perfect name for you.
7915480	7916040	Cotton bum.
7916040	7916840	Cotton bum.
7917480	7920120	Yeah, you just literally wouldn't have a furring.
7922520	7925480	What would my warrior cat name be?
7926280	7926680	I don't know.
7926680	7929720	Because when I was a kid, we role played like Naruto.
7929720	7930360	So I was like.
7930360	7931560	I also did that.
7931560	7933240	I also larped, you know, Naruto.
7933240	7935800	Yeah, I've larped enemies like a fucking loser.
7935800	7937720	Why does everyone have a membership?
7937720	7939080	Because they want to support me.
7939640	7939880	The.
7940840	7941080	Yeah.
7941080	7941800	Get out of here.
7941800	7942440	Gray name.
7943880	7947240	Yeah, leave my leave my leave my mommy alone.
7950600	7951320	Thank you for that.
7954200	7956680	You leave my you leave my mommy alone.
7956680	7957720	I love my mommy.
7958760	7960440	My sweet precious children.
7962200	7964040	Wait, so would you be a cat then, Chai?
7965800	7971000	Honestly, I think I always thought honestly.
7971960	7972520	I don't know.
7972520	7973640	I think I'd be a bunny.
7975000	7975800	Oh my gosh.
7975800	7976680	No way.
7976680	7977960	Be a bunny.
7977960	7980120	Yeah, I actually do think so.
7980120	7981880	I think I think a bunny.
7981880	7982840	That's cute.
7982840	7984840	You kind of almost have like floppy ears,
7984840	7986920	like like mine with your pigtails.
7986920	7987800	Yeah, too.
7987800	7988760	The floppy.
7988760	7990120	Because your hair is super long.
7991080	7993160	We're actually, I'm looking at us.
7993160	7996280	We're very similar, similar color palette.
7996280	7997880	Looks like a flat version of you.
8000040	8002120	My hair is just a little bit more blonder.
8003080	8006520	And I'm just going to canonically adopt you
8006520	8011960	and say that I slept with harem, a demonic harem.
8012600	8013880	Yeah, demonic harem.
8013880	8015000	That's why you have horns.
8015800	8018200	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, mommy.
8019160	8020520	We're going to adopt you.
8020520	8021560	Flap is justice.
8021560	8025720	Speaking of justice, we overlapped with their diffuse today.
8025720	8027400	I'll have to go back and watch the VODs.
8028520	8029080	We are cute.
8029080	8031480	I want to, I want to, I want to,
8031480	8033320	I want to be adopted with a hat.
8033320	8035640	You're my pet, you're my pet bug from the garden.
8035640	8036760	Remember, I keep you in my palm.
8036760	8037560	From the garbage.
8038520	8039240	From the garbage.
8039240	8039800	From the garbage.
8040520	8042520	This, this pocket has a lot of lint
8042520	8044840	and like those cool little crumbs in it.
8044840	8045320	And that's okay.
8045320	8046520	Some moss and stuff.
8046520	8047080	It's okay.
8047160	8051480	You can crawl around and ride between my boobies and stuff.
8051480	8053400	I did that during your debut, by the way.
8054200	8055160	Yours and Azura's.
8055160	8056040	I sat on your top.
8056040	8057960	I think I actually saw that in the, uh,
8058600	8060280	when I watched your VOD back.
8060280	8060840	That's right.
8061720	8063080	I heard Azura's voice.
8063080	8064120	I'm so sorry.
8064120	8064840	She's not here.
8064840	8065560	Thank God.
8065560	8067560	I heard Azura's voice and good lord.
8067560	8069960	If I, if I was a man, if I was a man,
8070680	8071880	I'm telling you the things I would do,
8071880	8073000	I would do for that woman.
8073000	8073560	Oh, wow.
8073560	8075560	She does have like, when I first heard her voice,
8075560	8078040	I almost, I almost died and went to heaven
8078040	8079560	because it's just pure sex.
8080200	8082440	I wanted to lift those things up and just
8082440	8083640	look at the sweat between them.
8083640	8084200	I don't know, man.
8084200	8085960	And she just, she just makes me a different person
8085960	8086600	thinking about her.
8088600	8089720	I want a voice like that.
8090600	8090920	Right.
8090920	8093080	Like she's, I don't know, man.
8093080	8095240	She was cooler, whatever, but Azura.
8097640	8098040	That's true.
8098040	8099640	I can't really compete with her voice.
8100200	8100760	Oh, sure.
8100760	8102120	But her voice surpasses.
8102600	8105320	Now, but you're, but you're, but you're my Oshi.
8105880	8107080	I'm your Oshi?
8107800	8108840	Yeah, you're my Oshi.
8108840	8109960	You're fucking lying.
8109960	8110760	Don't say that.
8111480	8113240	Oh, I'm going to cry.
8113240	8115080	Toma told me the same thing and I'm,
8115080	8116280	I'm literally going to lose it.
8116280	8117800	I'm going to cry into my pillow because they
8117800	8119560	don't deserve anybody's love.
8119560	8119880	Yep.
8121480	8122200	Yeah, you're right.
8124200	8124920	Who's who?
8125560	8127720	The really white one either we go.
8128280	8131080	And the beautiful, sexy blonde here,
8131080	8131880	devil girl.
8131880	8132920	I'm really cute.
8132920	8133400	Devil boy.
8133400	8134600	Here's his tie.
8135720	8136680	Sexy.
8136680	8137800	I got sexy.
8137800	8139160	She's a sexy little thing.
8140280	8142440	My sexy, my sexy daughter.
8143560	8143880	Whoa.
8143880	8144520	Yeah.
8144520	8146040	And the pet bug, I guess.
8147480	8149480	And my, um, garbage.
8152600	8153240	No, that's worse.
8153240	8155880	I prefer, I prefer, uh, she's just my little,
8155880	8156840	my little buggy daughter.
8157320	8160120	Um, no, the vaude is not getting nuked.
8161080	8162280	The vaude is not getting nuked.
8162280	8162840	Woo!
8162840	8163960	The first one!
8163960	8165240	First one you can keep up.
8168440	8170200	Wait, do you have to nuked vods?
8170200	8174200	I, I usually have to like cut or edit vods
8174200	8176120	or delete them completely because I will
8176120	8177720	just say really dumb shit that I'm not
8177720	8179080	supposed to say on YouTube.
8179960	8182680	But I say even more worse shit than I did on Twitch.
8184840	8185960	The price you pay.
8185960	8187160	I don't even know why.
8188440	8189000	Okay.
8189000	8189720	I didn't know that.
8191720	8192040	Yeah.
8192040	8194040	You should watch, uh, honestly,
8194040	8195720	Nori, you should play Class of 09.
8195720	8196760	I know you'd like that game.
8198200	8201080	I'm a, I'm a, I'm a visual novel elitist,
8201080	8202680	so I don't play anything that gets like
8203400	8204840	touched by normies, I guess.
8204840	8206280	Like once it's in a normie scene, I'm like,
8206280	8208920	I definitely don't think it's a normie game.
8209480	8210520	I don't think it's a normie game.
8210520	8211960	I, I, I've seen it.
8211960	8212920	I like visual novels.
8212920	8214200	Maybe I'll play it one day.
8214200	8214520	Yeah.
8214520	8215320	I highly, I think you're-
8215320	8217560	I feel like if I play it, I start crying.
8217560	8217800	Yeah.
8218760	8221240	I would like to see the both of you play it,
8221240	8223960	or maybe we'll do a collab where you, we go through,
8224840	8227080	we go through, uh, the visual novel
8227080	8228120	and just commentate on it.
8228120	8228760	That would be funny.
8229880	8231080	You would love that.
8231960	8233000	What's an Oshi again?
8233000	8235160	An Oshi is like, it's, okay,
8235160	8238520	it's like a huge dork for people that are new TV to be.
8238520	8240120	It is idol culture thingy.
8240120	8242440	So you have like, kind of like in K-pop,
8242440	8243320	you have a bias.
8243320	8246120	It's like one person in like maybe a group
8246200	8248680	or like an individual that you really, really enjoy
8249400	8251560	and you are constantly keeping like up with.
8252280	8255400	So like, my Oshi would be Chibi.
8255400	8256040	You know what I mean?
8258600	8259880	Like, I keep up with Chibi,
8259880	8262600	but my Kami Oshi is like, Ina.
8263480	8264760	I have so much Ina merch.
8264760	8265160	It's so bad.
8265160	8266680	I made for Chibi to make merch.
8266680	8269720	I didn't know that, uh, your, your Kami Oshi was Ina.
8269720	8270840	That's actually cute.
8270840	8271480	I do have-
8271480	8273160	Make myself purple for like,
8273720	8276120	every Vtuber that I've liked so far is purple.
8276120	8277880	So I just make myself purple.
8277880	8279560	Now that I really think about it.
8279560	8280920	All my favorite Vtubers are purple.
8280920	8283400	You're the only red Vtuber that I like.
8283400	8284680	I was supposed to be purple.
8284680	8285960	Look! I'm leaving!
8285960	8287480	I'm leaving!
8287480	8288520	You're my, there's, wait,
8288520	8289720	but Ty, you're my friend.
8291240	8292920	And Oshi will never notice me.
8292920	8294280	You're the only red Vtuber.
8294280	8294920	You're in-
8294920	8295880	Oh!
8295880	8297080	I meant my Oshi's.
8297080	8298120	I meant my Oshi's.
8298120	8299000	I meant my Oshi's.
8299000	8299800	He's sitting there.
8299800	8301080	Oh, okay, okay.
8301080	8302840	She's like, I like you.
8303320	8305320	Um, but yes, I do have merch since you mentioned that.
8305320	8306760	My merch is in my description.
8307400	8307880	A wink.
8310200	8311720	You can get your own, own a hole.
8311720	8312200	I'm kidding.
8312200	8312840	That's not true.
8312840	8313160	What?
8313160	8313480	You know-
8313480	8313800	No!
8315080	8317000	I actually, I might, I might buy it.
8317000	8318760	See, if you make my keychains and pins,
8318760	8319800	just ping me,
8319800	8322040	because I'll make a bag dedicated to you.
8322040	8323240	Aw, thank you.
8323240	8324040	That's really, very nice.
8324040	8324760	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
8324760	8326840	I'm like a really big j-
8326840	8329000	like fucking, what is it?
8329000	8330360	I don't nerd.
8330360	8331400	Sort of this like,
8331480	8333160	I'm, I'm sorry if I'm rambling.
8333160	8333640	I know.
8333640	8336360	Um, it's really, it's really cute when people have like bags,
8336360	8337160	like eat a bag.
8337160	8340040	So there's like a thing where it's literally the same merch
8340040	8341240	and one bag.
8341240	8341960	I didn't know that was-
8341960	8343000	I forgot what they're called.
8343640	8344920	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
8344920	8345960	So if you do that, let me know.
8345960	8347000	I have three for Ena.
8348600	8349400	That's really cute.
8349400	8350520	I didn't know that, Nori.
8350520	8351560	That's so adorable.
8352120	8353240	Hey, you just, yeah, this is just,
8353240	8353640	let me know.
8353640	8355480	I'm like, I like, I like pins and keychains.
8355480	8358440	Pick you up and smush you against my bosom.
8358440	8359880	You're so fucking adorable.
8360840	8362440	I would genuinely love that.
8362440	8364360	If you start feeling biting, ignore that.
8367800	8368120	Oh.
8368120	8369640	Don't say Ona Oshihou.
8369640	8370760	That's disgusting.
8371400	8373240	This is a safer work chat.
8373240	8374120	You hear that?
8374120	8377560	I may be screaming with a woman that does-
8383080	8384760	I might be a woman of the night,
8384760	8386200	but the other girls are not.
8386200	8387800	They don't do the sort of content I do.
8387800	8390760	So please do not think or assume or give them,
8390760	8392680	like, or sexually harass them or anything
8392680	8394520	because they don't make that content.
8394520	8397880	They're just, you're, you know, sweet, say-so.
8400360	8400840	In some ways.
8400840	8401480	Oh, yeah?
8401480	8401960	Yeah.
8401960	8402520	Yeah.
8402520	8405080	Oh, you're talking about us.
8405080	8406040	You're talking about us.
8406600	8407720	Oh, yeah.
8407720	8408920	I'm just edgy, ma'am.
8408920	8409880	What's the difference?
8409880	8410280	I don't know.
8411320	8414440	Once you get into the private chat in my Discord,
8414440	8415560	it's a little crazy.
8415560	8415880	Is it girl-central?
8415880	8417960	Once you get into VC with me, it's bad.
8417960	8418840	Groom!
8419480	8421160	Are you getting groomed by your moths?
8423160	8425080	No, you have to do the grooming yourself.
8425080	8427080	Honestly, Chai-Chai would do the grooming.
8427080	8428360	She just, like, she comes off as like,
8428360	8429640	I'm so sweet and innocent,
8429640	8432360	and then she'll just fucking groom the fuck out of you.
8433960	8434920	I'd be okay with that.
8435880	8436200	Same.
8436200	8436760	I'm here.
8436760	8437560	I'd be okay.
8439000	8440040	I don't know what I should say.
8440040	8440600	All right, Chai-Chai.
8441400	8441880	Uh-uh.
8442840	8443960	Let me, uh, look at the-
8443960	8444440	Oh, no.
8445000	8445480	Oh, my God.
8445480	8446200	And say thank you.
8446200	8447000	I feel kind of bad,
8447000	8448840	because I feel like I rumble a lot.
8448840	8449400	Oh, Chai-Chai.
8449400	8450120	You're fine.
8450120	8451240	I feel the same thing.
8451240	8452200	My-my chat knows-
8452200	8453560	Chai-Chai, this is our podcast.
8453560	8454680	You can say whatever you want.
8455240	8457320	My chat knows how much I app, so they-
8457320	8457880	They-
8457880	8458920	I guess.
8458920	8460600	Love you and Chai for the same reason.
8460600	8462040	Why do you act like I don't watch your streams?
8462040	8462760	Woman, I'm there.
8462760	8463320	I know that.
8463320	8463880	I'm there.
8463880	8464440	What do you mean?
8464440	8465960	I haven't seen your name!
8465960	8466440	Are you lurking?
8466440	8467400	Oh, I just look type.
8467960	8468440	God.
8468440	8468920	Okay.
8468920	8469640	Because I want to-
8469640	8470120	I get-
8470120	8472120	I get scared when people notice me.
8473000	8473400	I don't-
8473400	8474760	Actually, I feel the same way, so-
8474760	8476360	Okay, I'll never notice you ever.
8476360	8477800	I'll never perceive you.
8477800	8478360	No!
8478360	8479800	It's like, I don't want to explain it,
8479800	8482520	because then sometimes their chat starts talking to you,
8482520	8482840	and you're like,
8482840	8484040	oh, my God, please don't.
8484040	8485240	Please, I want to pee everywhere.
8485240	8485960	Don't do this.
8485960	8487400	You're gonna pee everywhere?
8487400	8488680	Yeah, I know what you mean.
8488680	8489480	Sometimes when you-
8489480	8490120	It's like, it's-
8490120	8491800	It's exciting when you talk in a French chat,
8491800	8492280	because then you're like,
8492280	8493240	oh, my God, hi!
8493240	8494840	But then you're like, oh, no, I'm like,
8494840	8495400	I don't know.
8495400	8495960	It's like-
8495960	8497640	Because like, you're taking away a pension from-
8497640	8498360	Yeah, yeah, yeah, right?
8498440	8499320	This was really bad.
8499320	8501720	I felt like, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah.
8501720	8504040	That's why I usually only say one or two things,
8504040	8505640	because I don't-
8505640	8507240	Like, especially with my gen mates,
8507240	8511080	because sometimes people move the chat's focus on me.
8511080	8512600	So I'm just like, I'll say hi,
8512600	8513480	and then I'll be like-
8513480	8514280	Yeah, quiet.

8617900	8619180	All right, watch, I'm an undefined
8619180	8621940	and they're probably me saying the most ridiculous shit.
8621940	8624380	It's like, oh, nice, happy, happy times.
8624380	8627020	That's exactly just how it feels sometimes.
8627020	8629340	Yeah, I had a nap.
8629340	8630340	I also had a nap.
8630340	8632980	I was scared I wasn't gonna wake up in time for the collab.
8632980	8634940	But I was genuinely like, if I sleep now,
8634940	8637140	I don't know if I'll wake up on time.
8637140	8639340	Yeah, I set an alarm.
8639340	8641460	I feel like, yeah, you know when you have those naps
8641460	8643460	where it's like you're, oh, home.
8643460	8644300	She back?
8644300	8645700	I went back.
8646660	8648740	I was just like, I was like listening to you guys talk.
8648740	8649700	Oh, cute.
8649700	8650700	To each other about her napping.
8650700	8652460	I'm talking about her napping.
8652460	8655220	I had really stressful dreams because like,
8655220	8657460	I feel like I went, I napped.
8657460	8659900	Like, I was like, okay, I have to like get up
8659900	8660900	after this stuff.
8660900	8664260	I have to, oh wait, raid, raid, raid.
8664260	8665220	Wait, oh my God, raid.
8665220	8666060	Hold on a second.
8667140	8667980	Oh, she's gone.
8667980	8670140	Thank you for the raid.
8670140	8671460	Thank you for the raid.
8671460	8672300	Oh my God.
8674740	8675660	Oh, she's muted.
8675700	8676540	What the fuck?
8676540	8678540	She's like, I disappeared.
8679940	8681780	She was shrimped.
8681780	8683260	What was it gonna say?
8683260	8684740	I take naps all the time.
8684740	8686460	I have a nap time schedule.
8686460	8687500	Like a pod board.
8687500	8689700	I've napped for like probably three hours today.
8689700	8692260	So that's why I don't know why I'm still so tired.
8692260	8694060	Yeah, I sleep at three or five.
8694060	8697140	No, in between, I'm just a child.
8697140	8700540	I know it's hard because I stream in my time slot
8700540	8702960	at the same time that I would normally nap.
8702960	8704660	So I have to nap earlier.
8704660	8706620	So then I sleep later or I nap later
8706620	8708740	and I sleep later and then I wake up at like 11.
8708740	8710500	I don't go to sleep until like five a.m.
8710500	8713980	and then I wake up at like 10 a.m., 10 p.m., 10 a.m.
8713980	8714940	all the time.
8716660	8718380	I have a horrible sleep schedule.
8718380	8719420	Don't nod.
8719420	8721260	I'm sorry, I've been yawning.
8721260	8722100	I'm yawning.
8722100	8723340	So I'm sorry.
8723340	8724180	Container.
8724180	8725020	You didn't go while you didn't go.
8725020	8725980	I'm boring or something.
8725980	8728260	No, I love you, stop.
8728260	8729980	Me, me, me, me.
8729980	8732980	Also, I'm so sorry, it's hair on my hair.
8732980	8733820	Yeah, hair on my hair.
8734100	8734940	Oh my God.
8734940	8738540	I made your, you're too much stream-solid.
8739420	8741580	It's the only time slot I'm available.
8742860	8745060	It's fine, they understand.
8745060	8747940	No, it's, you're guilty about it.
8747940	8749180	No, I don't feel guilty.
8749180	8752660	They're, I bet they believe that it was worth it
8752660	8754260	so they got to meet you and try.
8754260	8755100	So.
8755100	8755940	I hope so.
8755940	8756780	Yep.
8756780	8757780	I hope they liked it.
8757780	8758620	Yeah, I hope they did.
8758620	8760100	I'm just not, I'm gonna be all sad
8760100	8761940	when I lie being around you.
8761940	8762780	No.
8762900	8763900	Yes, I missed you.
8763900	8764740	I missed you a bunch.
8764740	8765580	All right.
8765580	8766420	No, you didn't miss me.

8769420	8770260	We just met.
8770260	8771580	We spent a little night.
8771580	8773420	You just met.
8773420	8774660	It's just the dreams.
8774660	8776100	You've just been in my dreams.
8776100	8778300	So it feels like we've known each other for months.
8778300	8780260	You've worked with me in my dreams.
8783260	8784860	What's happened to dreams, really?
8787580	8788500	I can tell you one of them.
8788500	8789900	I'm actually, I've had dreams.
8789900	8791980	It was weird though, cause he felt like,
8792060	8793580	you know, like you ever have like,
8793580	8795180	it's like we were an animic.
8795180	8796540	It was like in the real world.
8796540	8798500	So it was like you, but I was like a real person.
8798500	8799620	I don't know how to explain it.
8799620	8801860	Was I white or was I brown?
8801860	8803060	You were kind of tanned.
8803060	8804060	You were like tan.
8804060	8804900	Interesting.
8804900	8805740	You were like a tan.
8805740	8806580	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
8806580	8808100	But, but there was like a weird dream
8808100	8809500	and we were just talking to me
8809500	8810620	and like you were holding my hand.
8810620	8811780	I was like, oh my God.
8812700	8813540	She's touching me.
8813540	8814380	Oh my God.
8814380	8815420	Yeah, like she's touching me.
8815420	8816620	She's touching my hands.
8816620	8818540	Oh my, oh my days.

8825300	8830140	There's, I am hopefully planning to go to one.
8831140	8832780	I don't think you are,
8832780	8835460	I don't think your place of work is very far
8835460	8837140	from my little, my little hole in the hole.
8837140	8837980	Hi!
8837980	8839020	Hi, Ty.
8839020	8841100	Oh, did you guys know that I quit my job?
8841980	8842980	Yeah, I saw that.
8842980	8844300	Yeah, I saw that.
8844300	8846900	So I can, I can probably just
8847820	8852620	chalk myself across the states and go to you.
8852620	8854780	Wait, we're meeting in person?
8854780	8857020	No, I mean, like we're just,
8857020	8858900	she was telling me she had a dream
8858900	8860460	that we went to a con together.
8860460	8863220	And I was like, oh, I love what we're talking.
8863220	8865940	Koreans grind, Koreans grind.
8865940	8867020	Thank you for the follow.
8867020	8872020	Oh, oh, I was like, oh, good about Korean's that grind.

8875020	8877100	Noriko, more like stinky co.
8877100	8878420	I just thought you should know that.
8878420	8879540	I learned them.
8879540	8880380	Who said that?
8880380	8881220	Who said that?
8881220	8882060	Give me, give me.
8882060	8882900	Their names?
8882900	8883740	Self mechanic.
8883740	8884580	I was going to ban them,
8884580	8885420	but they're a certified tune,
8885420	8886820	but I don't think I should ban them.
8886820	8888420	No, you should just
8888420	8890700	flick them really hard in the forehead.
8890700	8892540	Why in the forehead?
8892540	8893700	Because that's where I remember my mom was.
8893700	8895260	Oh, you said flick them.
8895260	8897300	I've heard something else.
8897300	8898820	Yeah, you flick them in the forehead.
8898820	8900380	I thought you said fuck them in the forehead
8900380	8903100	and I was a little bit confused.
8903100	8904900	Oh, I guess from like the lobotomy.
8904900	8906380	Oh, yeah, there you go.
8906380	8908380	Well, that's kind of like the eye socket.
8909460	8910780	Doll spoon.

8918020	8919540	Do you guys like the cosplay?
8919540	8920380	I'm too.
8920380	8921780	I do like the cosplay.
8921780	8923500	I cosplayed myself.

8931700	8933300	I just noticed that one of you guys
8933300	8935100	sounds like Ruby Rose from Ruby.
8935100	8936380	Which one?
8936380	8938140	I don't think it's me.
8938140	8938980	Huh?
8938980	8941100	I get told I sound like Mabel in Peridot.
8942060	8943060	Oh, you do?
8943060	8944820	Oh, that's actually true.
8944820	8945940	Oh my God, that's so true.
8945940	8947260	You sound like Peridot.
8947260	8948580	That's so real.
8948580	8950700	I know, I get to sound like Peridot a lot.
8950700	8951620	Wait, who do I sound like?
8951620	8952900	Who do I sound like?
8952900	8955020	I want to sound like you from Ruby.
8955020	8957020	I think they say, yeah, they think you
8957020	8959260	sound like Ruby Rose from Ruby.
8959260	8960820	That's cool.

8963100	8964100	Ruby Rose?
8964100	8964940	Ruby Rose?
8964940	8966500	Is that the girl with the red hair?
8966500	8967940	Yeah, black and red?
8967940	8969860	Oh, she has some color palette, too.
8970700	8972380	Oh my gosh.
8972380	8974340	I got to hurt the typing.
8974340	8976660	Wait, like Ruby Rose, like Ruby Rose,
8976660	8979700	like the not like the Australian model in action.
8979700	8980940	No, not.
8980940	8982100	No, no, no, Ruby Rose.
8982100	8985140	You sound just like her when you do your Australian accent.
8985140	8986580	How do you do that?
8986580	8987420	Australia.
8987420	8988260	What?
8988260	8989100	Australia.
8989100	8990580	Australia.
8990580	8991740	Australia.
8991740	8996100	My chat also agrees that they kind of hear the Ruby.
8996100	8997300	Who's Ruby?
8997300	8998500	Kind of, who is it?
8998500	8999340	Ruby Rose.
8999340	9000660	Oh, you know, oh, I send it to you.
9000660	9002900	It's a little like red girl, is it not?
9002900	9003900	With the red hair.
9003900	9006740	I never watch Ruby, so I don't know.
9006740	9007580	Not gonna go.
9007580	9008420	Guys, I'm feeling stupid.
9008420	9009660	Oh, that girl.

9014820	9015980	You cost, it's from the show.
9015980	9018060	The show sucks, by the way.
9018060	9020060	I didn't watch the first season.
9020060	9020900	Chai, did you watch the show?
9020980	9022820	I was really proud.
9022820	9023660	Have I?
9023660	9024860	Yeah.
9024860	9029300	I want you so bad, I beg and I plead and I pray and I ask.
9029300	9032980	It's just a lot because of the jacket.
9032980	9035460	I gotta get the jacket commissioned.
9035460	9036300	That's true.
9036300	9038380	But everything else I can figure out,
9038380	9040540	like 3D printing, like certain parts,
9040540	9042460	and like the cuffs and the chains.
9042460	9043820	You know how to 3D print?
9045940	9048780	I can, I have the ability to.
9048780	9051620	I don't have a 3D printer, but I know someone who does.
9051620	9053220	Oh, that's pretty cool.
9053220	9056740	And I get down on my hands and knees and say, please.
9056740	9058060	Please.
9058060	9059380	I think it would work out.
9060740	9062620	I do cosplay, though.
9062620	9064700	I just got back from a convention.
9064700	9066820	I cosplayed three different ladies.
9066820	9069500	I was freerun, freerun.
9069500	9072740	Oh my gosh, you would be so good as freerun.
9072740	9075260	I did her dinner, dinner.
9075260	9076540	Oh my gosh, I have to.
9076540	9077660	I can show you guys pictures.
9077660	9079260	Please.
9079260	9082460	Yeah, I think they're really appropriate.
9082460	9089180	I have a blue archive cosplay that just arrived of Hoshino.
9089180	9093540	And I also cosplayed a chopper from One Piece.
9093540	9094260	Oh, that's funny.
9094260	9095220	Oh, that's funny.
9095220	9096980	Do you have pictures of that one?
9096980	9098580	Yeah, I'm getting into One Piece.
9098580	9100540	I'm still getting into One Piece.
9100540	9101540	Yeah.
9101540	9104980	I watched the Netflix live action.
9104980	9105980	Yeah, that was pretty good.
9105980	9109940	It hooked me in like, OK, now I have to kind of watch the show.
9109940	9112540	Oh, yeah, I did watch the live action, too, yeah.
9112540	9115340	I would love to cosplay, but I have really bad anxiety,
9115340	9118380	so I don't leave my home enough to do that.
9118380	9121700	I haven't cosplayed in years at an actual convention.
9121700	9123660	It's been a very, very long time.
9123660	9125100	It's a whole other night.
9125100	9127420	Cosplaying at home is a lot less exhausting.
9130100	9130700	I don't know.
9130700	9134500	It's just like, I guess the fear of buying a cosplay
9134500	9136180	and then be like, I should have, like, work with you.
9136180	9138780	Oh, like, yeah, if it doesn't get all the money right.
9138780	9140820	My boobs usually don't fit into a lot of things,
9140820	9145340	so I'd have to play a very big, boobed character.
9145340	9146940	Yeah, I have that problem, too.
9146940	9148220	I have that problem, too.
9148220	9149780	Yeah.
9149780	9150780	My point.
9150780	9153180	Yeah.
9153180	9158220	Chai's body type is essentially her model, Koff.
9158220	9159300	It's really sad.
9159300	9161620	My model is taller, though.
9161620	9163740	I think my model would probably fit into cosplays
9163780	9165940	better than I could, just because of me.
9165940	9166980	I think I'm smaller.
9166980	9167780	She's so small.
9167780	9168540	It's like, sucks.
9168540	9169260	Yeah.
9169260	9171100	It's like, oh, cute.
9171100	9174580	There are a lot of really cute characters in my opinion.
9174580	9177060	I feel like you can ask me a lot of hard things.
9177060	9178460	Sometimes they make the small.
9178460	9181060	Sometimes the small isn't even, like, small.
9181060	9181580	I don't know.
9181580	9185940	I think I'm just, I'm just stubby.
9185940	9188940	No, I'm stubby.
9188940	9191460	For me, it's a lot of the time the cosplay parents
9191460	9194100	never go past my buttocks.
9194100	9196100	She's got a fat ass.
9196100	9197820	Yeah, my bag.
9197820	9198620	Yeah, yeah.
9198620	9199940	She's small with a fat ass.
9199940	9202260	Wait, don't be boob fat ass.
9202260	9203180	And let me have you.
9203180	9205140	You need to, man, too.
9205140	9207620	And then your little cute pet hunt.
9207620	9210140	OK, I'm also kind of, I'm also kind of pet-on,
9210140	9210740	so it's fine.
9210740	9212980	Yeah, you're also a pet-on, yeah.
9212980	9213980	Now we start that in sim.
9213980	9216180	It's just my butt.
9216180	9217420	That's the Hispanic jeans.
9217420	9218540	Just hit her there.
9218540	9220380	Yeah, it's just my butt.
9220380	9221060	I don't know why.
9221140	9222380	I don't understand.
9222380	9224220	I also haven't cosplayed in a long time
9224220	9227580	because people sometimes when you're brown
9227580	9228420	and you cosplay a white character.
9228420	9230260	Oh my god, it's so bad.
9230260	9232980	They just bitch and moan and I'm like, I don't.
9232980	9233460	Yeah.
9233460	9235700	You get called like the hard-art name version
9235700	9236500	of the character.
9236500	9240780	It's so, it's so, it's so mad.
9240780	9242900	It's like, damn, it's like they kind of got me there.
9242900	9246060	They'll be like, N-word, Shinobi or something like that.
9246060	9248980	I think I've seen that for like Gojo when somebody was
9248980	9250140	cosplaying as Gojo.
9251940	9253980	That's like the one thing that works.
9253980	9256660	No, no, no, I've seen somebody like a black Gojo
9256660	9259300	and people just fucking ragged on them.
9259300	9260580	It's ridiculous.
9260580	9263620	The cosplay community is like, it's just, you know,
9263620	9265620	like the cosplay community just kind of sucks.
9265620	9271300	Like it's very toxic and it's not warm and fuzzy
9271300	9272700	for the most part, but I can tell you.
9272700	9276500	Which is sucks because it's like, OK, this is not really weird.
9276580	9278940	I think when anime got mainstream and all the very
9278940	9281060	attractive people started doing cosplay,
9281060	9283620	it kind of ruined the vibe of like, oh, it's just a bunch
9283620	9285380	of nerds having fun together.
9285380	9287660	I agree, but it's like, when anime-
9287660	9289100	It's like Hot Girl Central.
9289100	9291540	Yeah, because it's like, in my opinion,
9291540	9294900	I appreciate like a more like messy looking cosplay
9294900	9296940	because like you can tell that they really like the character
9296940	9300180	than like a full blown, like full glam cosplay
9300180	9301340	because it's just for photo shoots.
9301340	9305460	Like, um, anime becoming popular sucks, it's so bad.
9305460	9306620	It's like retubing, too.
9306620	9307820	Like, it's so bad.
9307820	9309420	It's very mainstream, though.
9309420	9310980	It's sad. It is sad.
9310980	9313460	And it sucks to like say it because then you sound like
9313460	9316180	like a gatekeeper, like even gatekeeper.
9316180	9318340	But it's like, but it's true.
9318340	9321020	It is true because like the feeling of like the anime,
9321020	9323860	the community, the cosplay community and all that, like,
9323860	9328820	it was so different before like 2020, I'd say, like 20.
9328820	9330980	Yeah, 2020, like right around the pandemic,
9330980	9332900	when it did get really popular.
9332900	9334180	It was like, oh my God, yay.
9334180	9336500	All the people who bullied me, like finally, like,
9336500	9338140	now you guys can see it's cool.
9338140	9340580	But at the same time, like a lot of, yeah.
9340580	9341780	But yeah, exactly right.
9341780	9343780	Like, God damn, this is like, this is my thing.
9343780	9345940	It's like, yay, I know, it's supposed to be my thing,
9345940	9348020	where I was supposed to be like this little geek.
9348020	9350580	Like, they do it better because they're like hot and sexy
9350580	9351460	and like have a lot of.
9351460	9356100	It also sucks that a lot of anime is going to be very weird
9356100	9357980	and have very like obscure themes.
9357980	9360380	And then people are like, this is disgusting.
9361500	9363220	And it's like, even then, it's like, I could,
9363260	9364460	there's some anime that I'm like, you know,
9364460	9365860	that's a little too weird for my taste,
9365860	9368100	but I'm not going to show people that, like,
9368100	9370900	it's like the weird, like, puritan thing
9370900	9373340	people have going on with, and like just the anime.
9373340	9374300	Yeah.
9374300	9375820	And then like, oh my God,
9375820	9377820	so I could talk about this topic for hours.
9377820	9380620	It's like a different kind of like,
9380620	9382180	cause it's like initially, like it was like,
9382180	9383980	oh, I feel embarrassed that I like this stuff
9383980	9386060	because they're bullying me for liking anime.
9386060	9386900	Yeah.
9386900	9389660	But now that they know, it's like they have
9389660	9392060	all these things to say, like, oh, this is wrong.
9392060	9394620	You can't like this, but you can't like this.
9394620	9395860	You can't like this, you can't like this.
9395860	9398500	Like now that they're like, you know,
9398500	9400220	they're more familiar with it.
9400220	9402220	Yeah, they're dictating what's wrong.
9402220	9404180	It's like, no, no, no, no.
9404180	9407780	Happening with visual novels as well.
9407780	9410020	I have noticed that I've seen some stuff.
9410020	9412540	And it's really bad, cause in my opinion,
9412540	9414700	visual novels is the one medium
9414700	9417420	where people can be really weird.
9417420	9421660	There are some really like weird, disturbing visual novels
9421740	9424220	and people are like, oh, but the girls are cute,
9424220	9426220	but this game is so icky and gross.
9426220	9427460	You know, the place is weird.
9427460	9429060	It's like, maybe you look into the characters
9429060	9431180	before you're like, I'm in a cosplay-less character.
9431180	9432020	Yeah.
9432900	9434260	Saiyan Uta Kof Kof.
9434260	9435620	I think Afumo is,
9437260	9439740	Afumo should have never existed for Saiya.
9441100	9444180	I know, I was, I saw seeing a lot about that
9444180	9447340	on my timeline, just like Saiya blowing up and-
9447340	9450540	Yeah, Saiya's blowing up and people that hate the things
9450540	9452420	that Saiya talks about are like, I love Saiya.
9452420	9454340	She's so cool.
9454340	9456100	And it's like, you would not like the game,
9456100	9457420	but it's okay.
9458340	9460380	But then anime and VTuber are coming mainstream
9460380	9461700	was a mistake.
9462700	9464380	Gay keep it.
9464380	9465700	Push the little show.
9465700	9467540	Gay keep it, let's gay keep.
9467540	9468740	It's like, I don't want to gay keep,
9468740	9470180	cause it's like, I think it's fun to like
9470180	9471620	see VTuber merge in public,
9471620	9473340	but then it's like, it sucks when people are like,
9473340	9475940	this VTuber isn't talking about these things.
9475940	9477940	But VTuber does this thing, and it's like,
9479060	9479900	you know.
9480020	9482660	Everything feels so restricting, cause it's like,
9482660	9485780	oh, I feel like I have these rules to follow.
9485780	9488220	Or it's like, before I didn't feel like there was any rules,
9488220	9489540	I could just be like-
9489540	9491500	You need to be a little dork with other dorks
9491500	9492860	and having fun.
9492860	9494220	Be a little dork.
9494220	9495060	Yeah.
9495060	9497300	Yeah, you kind of put more under a microscope.
9498500	9500020	She's getting a figure too.
9500020	9502180	I know, that's like gonna be awful.
9503380	9505540	Plus Saiya's getting a figure?
9505540	9507940	Again, yeah, it's cause she got popular again.
9509940	9512140	It's such a hell of a lot of love.
9512140	9513860	It's such a hell of a lot of love.
9513860	9515300	It's such a hell of a lot of love.
9515300	9516700	It's such a hell of a lot of love.
9516700	9518380	What, what, what, what?
9518380	9519220	What, what, what?
9519220	9520580	That's the part where we all just like make weird noises.
9520580	9521500	Yeah, I know, I know.
9521500	9522340	Oh, I know.
9522340	9525340	I'm just very, I'm very passionate about my enemies
9525340	9527380	and my enemies' topic.
9527380	9528380	I don't know.
9528380	9530300	So all your enemies, I like weird.
9530300	9533460	Sunshine smiles, what about that?
9533460	9535740	Yeah, it's true, like fruit baskets.
9535740	9536580	Yeah!
9536580	9538940	Would they want more in this world?
9538940	9541620	No, they would want kindness and happiness.
9541620	9542860	Aw.
9542860	9546420	Happy, happy, smile, a little bunny cuteness.
9546420	9546920	It's real.
9546920	9549060	I watched Fritz basket in the longest time.
9549060	9552580	I literally, somebody snapped me back in to remind me
9552580	9554980	of like, Natalia acts as powers.
9554980	9556420	And I was like, holy crap.
9556420	9558380	Oh my god, Natalia!
9558380	9559220	Yeah, I know, right?
9559220	9562740	I think everyone can agree that Natalia did not age well.
9562740	9563240	No!
9563240	9565900	But Fritz could not admit that's one of the reasons.
9565900	9567460	No one talks about it.
9567460	9571020	Nobody, it's OK, it's fine.
9571020	9575860	I think that, I was really happy that Fritz basket got it.
9575860	9578260	Because Fritz basket was the first, like the original Fritz
9578260	9581780	basket was the first anime I ever watched.
9581780	9584500	So like, when I got a remake, I was really scared because I
9584500	9587300	was like, I can mess this up so bad.
9587300	9588140	I haven't watched the remake.
9588140	9590020	Is it good?
9590020	9593220	Yeah, I didn't watch the first season because I was like,
9593220	9596260	well, I feel like I already knew everything that happened.
9596260	9598220	But I watched the second season, third season,
9598220	9599140	and it was so good.
9599140	9602220	And I cried, and I was like, oh my god, happy.
9602220	9602780	I have to watch it.
9602780	9604540	It follows the manga a lot more.
9604540	9607060	I do recommend it if you have the time.
9607060	9612060	I will say, new romance anime for, OK.
9612060	9613580	I think you guys want to understand more.
9613580	9615780	Anime has become more for male, so it's
9615780	9619380	very hard to get female-centered romance anime.
9619380	9620620	Oh, like, so-so.
9620620	9622940	Yes, because if it's for men, no offense,
9622940	9625340	because there's some anime that are like, harrowing for guys.
9625340	9626740	And I'm like, oh, this is so great.
9626740	9629940	Like, 100 girlfriends that I really like you?
9629940	9630820	Great anime.
9630820	9631300	That was so cute.
9631300	9632660	Please watch an anime.
9632660	9634700	It's so good.
9634700	9637300	But I feel like we need more anime like Futsu Baskets
9637300	9640340	and Nana and Paradise Kiss for women.
9640340	9640740	I know.
9640740	9641700	That'll never happen.
9641700	9644140	I feel like I wonder if we'll ever return.
9644140	9646700	But then there's like, I feel like all the mangas that
9646700	9648900	would be the same, they're not going to get adapted
9648900	9652300	because they're so old and no one talks about them anymore.
9652300	9654180	Or they're too small and obscure.
9654180	9657980	They have no English translation, so it's no point.
9657980	9660660	I'm reading your chat, but I'm not this and guys
9660660	9662940	that like, show Joe, I don't, I think you misinterpreted.
9662940	9666780	I'm saying not a lot of anime's art, like, for women,
9666780	9669180	like, like, or on Host Club.
9669180	9669940	I miss Aura.
9669940	9670500	Things like that.
9670500	9670940	Oh, my God.
9670940	9671460	I miss Aura.
9671460	9672860	I miss Aura.
9672860	9676180	Peach Girl, like, we're missing, like, we're missing the female,
9676180	9678180	like, for the female fans.
9678180	9682500	And it's not the same.
9682500	9683060	You know what I mean?
9683060	9685180	You need some of the for the girlies, you know?
9685180	9685940	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
9685940	9687140	That is really scary.
9687140	9691220	Kimi ni todoke, it's the romance one.
9691220	9693620	She has, like, long, straight, black hair.
9693620	9695820	Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
9695820	9697140	What's that one about?
9697140	9698380	Yes.
9698380	9701780	I think she's like popular boy and she's like weird, scary girl,
9701780	9702420	but they end up together.
9702420	9704020	Oh, yes, I heard about that one.
9704020	9704820	I haven't watched it though.
9704820	9707220	It's literally the anime of fucking miscommunication.
9707220	9708500	They're really, she's so mean.
9708500	9710620	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
9710620	9712660	My dress of darling is such a guy anime.
9712660	9713620	I am so sorry.
9713620	9715620	Oh, yeah, that one has fanservice.
9715620	9716700	Yeah, that's for guys.
9716700	9717380	That one's like, yeah.
9717380	9720220	So the difference between, oh my gosh, I look such a dork.
9720220	9722820	The difference between female and male-centered animes
9722820	9727220	is that male-centered animes will have a lot of, like,
9727220	9729300	unnecessary fan service for the girls.
9729300	9731540	And then, like, the girl ones are like,
9731540	9735860	oh, holy shit, the beach episode is your fan service.
9735860	9738340	But the beach episode is always, like, a part of the plot.
9738340	9741020	Like, in Oron Coast Club, they go into, like, the little water
9741020	9742620	park.
9742620	9744420	Or, like, I think of, like, animes, like,
9744420	9745860	do you guys remember Free?
9745860	9747140	Like, that was, like, a big one.
9747140	9748140	Yes.
9748140	9750660	Free was supposed to be a yowie anime, by the way.
9750660	9753060	Yeah, or, like, it played against it.
9753060	9755180	It was, like, a tease the whole time.
9755180	9756740	I remember fucking being obsessed with that.
9756740	9758140	But it's, like, usually.
9758140	9758740	Who did you ship?
9758740	9761100	Was it Rin Haru or Mako Haru?
9761100	9762980	Oh, no, yeah.
9762980	9764140	What did you say?
9764140	9764740	Both.
9764740	9765220	Both?
9765220	9766340	Yeah, I think I was Rin Haru.
9766340	9768780	Oh, Nagisa on the blue-haired guy with the glasses.
9768780	9770980	That was my, like, oh, chin.
9771940	9772740	Wait, wait, wait.
9772740	9777580	Who was your first character you shipped together?
9777580	9778860	Wait, what'd you say?
9778860	9781820	You're both first characters you shipped together.
9781820	9782740	Like, in general.
9782740	9785380	He could have caught him.
9785380	9786380	Wait, what?
9786380	9787740	He could have caught him?
9787740	9788820	He could have caught him?
9788820	9789780	Are you kidding?
9789780	9790700	Oh, so true.
9790700	9791180	That's a lie.
9791180	9793460	Yeah, I'm glad you're right.
9793460	9795460	I wanted you to ship them, though.
9795460	9798220	Yeah, but they literally, like, sleep together naked.
9798220	9804740	Listen, my young brain did not care.
9804740	9809380	And, you know, Twinsist is Winsist.
9809380	9811100	I do love that, I mean, I think it also
9811100	9812300	eats pretty bad things.
9812300	9814780	Oh, yeah, 100%.
9814780	9817220	What about you, Chai?
9817220	9819060	See it again?
9819060	9822580	The first two characters you ever shipped together?
9822580	9827140	First two characters I ever shipped together was Fruitsbasket.
9827140	9831820	It would have been Yuki and Toru.
9831820	9832780	OK, OK, OK.
9832780	9834260	That's cute.
9834260	9839340	And then Honey Senpai and Mori Senpai.
9839340	9840020	Oh, yes.
9840020	9844820	I also shipped a thousand, like, millions.
9844820	9846340	I'm going to tell you mine.
9846340	9848420	And this is the reason why I asked this question,
9848420	9849660	because mine's is really bad.
9849660	9850260	OK.
9850260	9850900	I want to know.
9850900	9854420	So mine's was SpongeBob and Squidward.
9854420	9856780	Oh, we're going that far back?
9857220	9859540	Oh, I thought we were in the context of anime.
9859540	9862100	Oh, no, no, I said first, not anime.
9862100	9863100	Anime is different.
9863100	9865540	Anime, mine's was SpongeBob and Squidward.
9865540	9867020	Mine's was going crazy.
9867020	9868540	They're very confused.
9868540	9871180	And I would always draw them kissing.
9871180	9874900	And I would, like, follow Japanese artists and, like,
9874900	9875500	things like that.
9875500	9880060	And then I went down the Tom and Jerry
9880060	9882180	pipeline of, like, Japanese artists.
9882180	9887020	And they still draw them together until this day.
9887020	9888540	SquidBob.
9888540	9891340	Yeah, I was like, SquidBob or SpongeWade.
9891340	9894340	Mine, if it wasn't anime related, I'm like.
9894340	9895620	It's just any media.
9895620	9897740	Any media that you, like, consumed so much,
9897740	9898940	there was, like, yeah.
9898940	9902740	I'm like, was it, like, Starfire and Raven?
9902740	9904340	From Teen Titans, I don't know.
9904340	9907180	Oh, that's good, that's good.
9907180	9908660	Yeah, I can't recall.
9908660	9912020	I'm too old for that at the age of 56.
9912020	9915180	Damn, sorry.
9915180	9917420	Cosmo and Timmy.
9917420	9919780	You know, I see, I was thinking that, too.
9919780	9921700	Like, first, when I was trying to think back,
9921700	9923180	I'm like, was that Cosmo?
9923180	9925860	Oh, yeah, Cosmo and Timmy, I think.
9925860	9927940	No, I got to think about that hard.
9927940	9930900	I feel like I wasn't, like, in the shipping mindset.
9930900	9932940	I was just like, yeah, TV on my screen.
9932940	9934260	TV on my screen.
9934260	9938060	I can tell you what moment made me ship them together.
9938060	9938540	Please tell me.
9938540	9939300	I know exactly.
9939300	9940140	It's so bad.
9940140	9945540	So when SpongeBob finds him eating a crabby patty,
9945540	9947540	and he's like, you like them, don't you screw him.
9947540	9949860	He's going on fairies with Lesley.
9949860	9951700	Oh, yes, I remember this one.
9951700	9954620	I was in, like, my anime phase, so I saw that,
9954620	9958660	and I was like, yeah, this is peak.
9958660	9961340	This is my OTP.
9961340	9967300	Yeah, this is my OTP, and I have, like, a fan page for them.
9967300	9970340	My friend Kumi, she's in chat right now,
9970340	9973180	and she said Mr. Krabson Plankton.
9973180	9974940	Oh, that's a good one.
9974940	9977100	That's a really good one.
9977100	9980460	But, no, it wasn't the inflation part.
9980460	9981460	It wasn't when he was fat.
9981460	9983220	It was like, he was just, like, eating it,
9983220	9985860	and he was like, oh, you like them, don't you screw him.
9985860	9987060	He's like, no, I don't.
9987060	9988620	And then I thought of, like, an anime
9988620	9990620	where they, like, kabadon each other.
9990620	9992020	And then, you know, last year, I was like, oh, my god,
9992020	9996020	what did SpongeBob was kabadoning fucking Squidward?
9996020	9997340	Oh, my god.
9997340	9998540	Wait, you remember?
9998540	10001020	There was that one scene where it's like,
10001020	10003100	SpongeBob says bye Squidward twice,
10003100	10004860	and he's like, yeah, I like Squidward.
10004860	10006460	He's like, I like Squidward.
10006460	10010140	Like, I like Squidward, I'm telling you,
10010140	10013220	they didn't even mention Squidward, so.
10013220	10015260	They teased it.
10015260	10016300	I loved it.
10016300	10017660	I don't know, I had, like, I don't know,
10017660	10019540	I was like, I was just a crack ship.
10019540	10022140	Yeah, I was like, yeah, I was just a crack ship.
10022140	10025620	Yeah, Gojo and Cinderella is the one that's like a thing.
10025620	10027340	Yeah, that's a thing.
10027340	10028180	How the fuck is that?
10028180	10029020	I don't know why.
10029020	10030180	I don't know, what?
10030180	10031020	Wait, no.
10031020	10033020	What's the bikini bottom horror?
10033020	10035020	Someone said blame Sheebie.
10035020	10036540	What's the bikini?
10036540	10038020	Oh, Sheebie, sheebie deal.
10038020	10040140	I don't know what they mean by that.
10040140	10044140	Oh, oh, it's not your fault, it's just your fault.
10044140	10046140	It's just my fault.
10046140	10047340	No, wait, I got it wrong.
10047340	10051900	It's Sakuna and Cinderella, and then it's Gojo and Elsa.
10051900	10054420	Elsa, I was gonna say it's 100% Elsa
10054420	10055260	because they like math.
10055260	10058900	It's Elsa, yeah, but Sakuna and Cinderella, I don't know.
10058900	10059740	Gojo and Cinderella.
10059740	10061220	Although, I do like those random edits
10061220	10064540	where they'll splice a bunch of Disney cartoons together
10064540	10065380	and TikTok.
10065380	10067420	Do you know, like, Vima, Bad Boy, Vima, Vima, Vima, Vima.
10067420	10069340	Yeah, baby, get it.
10069340	10072940	I think there's some shrek in someone from El Dorado
10072940	10075540	or something, I don't even fucking know.
10075540	10077060	Wait, what's El Dorado?
10077060	10082940	It's an old, lesser known Disney movie, animated movie.
10082940	10085780	You would probably like it, The Road to El Dorado.
10085780	10086620	Yeah, I know it.
10086620	10088100	Because you're Spanish.
10088100	10089460	OK, thanks.
10089460	10093580	Ash, Ash, catch them in Sky from Paw Patrol.
10093580	10094740	Oh, it's DreamWorks.
10094740	10097020	This Sky of Dog?
10097020	10098460	Sky's a dog.
10098460	10100460	What?
10100460	10103660	You don't know El Dorado?
10103660	10104660	Sorry, DreamWorks.
10104660	10107380	Next could be something you should compare and deal.
10107380	10110620	I did ship Gojo and Dio when I watched it,
10110620	10111660	but I thought it was a great ship.
10111660	10113140	How could you not?
10113140	10115220	Yeah, I did, too.
10115220	10118420	I always love enemies to lovers.
10118420	10120820	In real life, though, that'd be fucking insufferable,
10120820	10122180	but enemies to lovers, right?
10122180	10122860	Yeah.
10122860	10124140	Or rivals to lovers.
10124140	10124660	I like that.
10124660	10130060	Like, that's a more realistic trope, in my opinion.
10130060	10131220	Sky is a dog.
10131220	10132500	What do you mean it would make more sun?
10132500	10132980	Shut up.
10132980	10133660	Wait, what?
10133660	10135500	I missed that part of it.
10135500	10138340	She looked up Ash, catch them in Sky from Paw Patrol.
10138340	10139500	Ash, catch them in Sky.
10139500	10140340	Nothing came up.
10140380	10142300	I think that's just their personal ship.
10142300	10142780	What?
10142780	10143900	That's just their personal.
10143900	10145380	That's just their own thing.
10145380	10145860	That's it.
10145860	10146900	Yeah, that's their own.
10146900	10148260	What the fuck?
10148260	10148740	You freak.
10148740	10149980	Is this a pinkish dog?
10149980	10150980	Or like, has paint on it?
10150980	10152460	Yeah, that's a girl dog, I think.
10152460	10153940	Oh, my god.
10153940	10156300	The only girl dog on the team.
10156300	10159140	Stuart Little in Wreck-It-Row.
10159140	10159660	Oh, my god.
10159660	10162980	I had a huge crush on Stuart Little.
10162980	10164580	I had a really big crush on Stuart Little.
10164580	10165340	No, I made Stuart Little.
10165340	10166340	I ate him, I ate him, I ate him.
10166340	10168940	I think it says, like, in my brain, in my brain,
10168940	10170740	I was like, nerdy white guy, you know,
10170740	10173660	brown women attracted to a white man.
10173660	10175220	That's cool, lead balls.
10175220	10177460	No, I ain't doing it, I don't hate him.
10177460	10179580	I have to look up these movies in Spanish,
10179580	10182180	because I don't know what that, I treasure planet.
10182180	10182620	What is that?
10182620	10185620	I hate Stuart Little for trying to put a deep, rooted
10185620	10187300	personal reason.
10187300	10187780	Why?
10187780	10189220	I know.
10189220	10191380	I also, I could tell you guys.
10191380	10193500	I don't like Stuart Little because I remember watching
10193500	10196580	Mouse Hunt, and I hated the Mouse and Mouse Hunt.
10196620	10199940	And then, Stuart Little was also a Mouse, so.
10199940	10201100	That's fair.
10201100	10203860	See, somebody, I watched in Spanish.
10203860	10206340	When I see the English child, I have to Google them,
10206340	10208500	because I don't know what that means.
10208500	10209340	Why they do that?
10209340	10213100	Wait, what about Reckon Ralph's ex-fixit Felix?
10213100	10214100	I shit that.
10214100	10215860	Well, that's just, yeah, that's just, like, you know, again.
10215860	10216900	Like, I had a rival.
10216900	10220100	I like the, yeah, rivals under me.
10220100	10222700	It was funny, though, because he was, like, Ralph.
10222700	10224180	They weren't even mean to each other.
10224180	10227060	They were just, like, hey, Ralph, you just can't hang out here.
10227060	10229460	You break everything.
10229460	10235060	Wait, Reckon Ralph ex-merida from Brave is, like, a real chip.

10241460	10244380	Oh, yes, I fucking love Treasure Planets.
10244380	10246860	OK, why did you give the cat lady to the fat ass?
10246860	10248540	Is this, like, an actual thing?
10248540	10251380	She doesn't have a fat ass in the movie,
10251380	10252380	but that's pretty cool.
10252380	10253380	Yeah, I like that image.
10253380	10255380	I like how she's turning around.
10255380	10259380	OK, I'm like, like, they just made her ass so big.
10259380	10260380	Like, why?
10260380	10262380	Like, in the group chat, I looked up Treasure Planets.
10262380	10263380	I was looking for things I saw.
10263380	10264380	Why is her butt cheeks so big?
10264380	10267380	I own Treasure Planet on DVD.
10267380	10269380	I'm pretty proud of that.
10269380	10271380	Oh, my gosh.
10271380	10273380	That's a pretty good reaction.

10337380	10339380	Her Shrek is super short.
10339380	10341380	Do you think she would like Shrek?
10341380	10343380	I think she would love Shrek.
10343380	10344380	I think she'd be.
10344380	10349380	Yeah, honestly, I think she would actually have a thing for him.
10349380	10350380	Oh, my gosh.

10479380	10482380	He's going to, we're going to, he likes blonde hair.
10482380	10483380	She's the other one.

10929180	10940300	Wait, what's that word? Misogynist. I liked. Do you guys know Papyrus from Undertale?

11015060	11027380	Non human characters that are hot. I'm still trying to think. I don't know. I had too much of a
11027380	11034740	grind set. I didn't have time for crushes. Okay, I can think. I remember now. Bumblebee from
11034740	11040660	Transformers. Bumblebee from Transformers. And then when he spoke, when he spoke, I was really
11040660	11055020	into it. And then I really had a huge crush on Godzilla. I thought Godzilla was so cool. Spirit
11055020	11063100	the horse. Yes. Oh, yes. Yeah. Spirit that was Spanish. It was so sexy. I will lie. Yeah,
11063140	11073460	that's that's literally the whole movie. That's a seductive horse. And Balto from Balto. I don't
11073460	11087180	know man. You guys are weird. You didn't think this horse from Spirit is hot. Yeah. I don't
11087180	11095580	even know what that is. You never watched Spirit recently. I think it was a horse girl. Neither
11095580	11100580	was I, but I watched. Wait, show me. Show me him. Okay, that's him. Oh, there you go.
11100580	11114180	Long hair. Yes. Yes. Men with long hair. I think I just like incels. I'm thinking about it more.

11125980	11136780	range. But if you're like a person, I don't know what my type is. Maybe guys like Sonic. I just
11136780	11146260	watched you put spirit. Watch them appear on the screen. You just corrupt the child image. One
11146260	11153820	gift was all it took. Spirit is a very charismatic horse. Yeah. And then we were like a horse. I
11153820	11158500	felt like I was being flirted with. No, it wasn't the size difference or the power. I think it was
11158500	11170780	Godzilla's like swag. I was like, holy shit. All of them. I have a problem. Oh, wait, no. And
11170780	11177300	my action I lied. My first human crush was one of the monsters in Power Rangers in Power Rangers
11177300	11183140	Samurai. I remember which one I just know is Power Rangers Samurai. I fucking I would do it with
11183140	11188100	show about Power Rangers. Every time I feel like I'm on screen, I was like, oh, yeah, this is
11188100	11193820	hot. I used to have a really big crush on Zuko too. I think everyone does. That's just basic. That's
11193820	11205780	basic. Yeah, it's pretty basic. That's my basic one. What about Uncle Irel? Am I right? I agree. No,
11206260	11216100	honestly would. No, I'm kidding. This is a safe space. Try. No judgment here. Try. Oh, yeah,
11216100	11223780	right. I don't even think she be kind to you. Um, not in the place. Oh, the cucumber from
11223780	11232660	Veggie Tales. No. Veggie Tales. I was forced to watch Veggie Tales. I didn't like Veggie
11232660	11241860	Tales. I have to watch it. I could watch it to learn English. That's a great show to watch to
11241860	11242820	learn English.
11242820	11246820	I don't know.
11246820	11258260	Iro in his prime. Buff Iro in jail. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah. Guilf, Guilf. 100%.
11258260	11265460	You guys are just listing off basically every character now. Not all. Not all. Not all.
11266100	11273540	Do you guys remember that movie Meet the Robinsons? Yes. Oh, the like black hair. Black hair? Yeah.
11276500	11283780	Okay, yeah, that's actually kind of real. I had a crush on Goob, the evil guy. I had a crush on
11283780	11290580	the evil guy. Oh, I had a crush on, um, what's his face? The enemy and the Incredibles?
11291540	11299700	And what was his name? Central? Yeah. Yeah. I had a crush on Goob, the white hair lady. You
11299700	11304500	remind me of the white hair lady. I remind you of the white haired lady? Yeah, I think she's really
11304500	11311940	pretty. Oh, you are like her. You are like her. Um, Goob when he was older, so like when he was
11311940	11319380	like all hunchbacked and like dirty looking and yeah. I like the one slur, but I think that was
11319380	11324980	pretty basic. No, no, that's a pretty, that's a pretty. I totally get it though. Like it makes
11324980	11334900	sense. Yeah. Mirage. Yeah, he's reminded Mirage. I don't know. I think it's the lowering appeal
11335620	11340180	with her. I don't know. I think, I think if I'm like trying to like,
11340180	11348980	hmm, it'd be like, oh, I'm, I'm kind of bad, but I'm, I'm like protective.
11350100	11356100	Like I'm like, I'm strong and I'm powerful. Yeah, maybe bad boy. Maybe like Draco mouth.
11359220	11363620	But it's like, but it's like, oh, but, but like for the one I love, I'm like soft and
11363620	11374500	protective and sweet. You know? Oh, so like Edward from Twilight. Oh, but no, not really. I

11386020	11393060	Quasimodo. From hunchback of Notre Dame. Um, I like the old man. Sorry. You like the old man?
11393060	11397060	I was, I liked the gypsy girl. I can't remember her name. Was it Esmeralda?
11397060	11401060	Okay. Cause I, okay. I wasn't in Spanish, right? Okay. I wasn't in Spanish, right? So in Spanish,
11401060	11407460	I have seen the Spanish version. I would get so. The voice actor was crazy for Spanish.
11407460	11414660	He just sounded so good. So I kind of just like fumbled everything. And I'm also like,
11414660	11420340	I'm kind of religious. So religious man, evil religious man. I was like, oh, this is amazing.
11421300	11427780	The creepy priest. Younger, little meaner than what I wanted. And I wanted the creepy old looking
11427780	11437940	man. Guys, I don't know who's that. I'm looking them up. Um, I can steal a Frollo from hunchback
11437940	11447300	of Notre Dame. Frollo, hunchback. Sakuna, like, well, that's like basic. Yeah, like, yeah, he's hot.
11447300	11449780	But like, we're trying to get to the fucked up ones, you know?
11452100	11462900	Oh, um, Pennywise. Pennywise? Pennywise? What was, what was the thingy from
11462900	11469380	I like the actor. The Demi Gorgon, but I never watched anything. So it was just the Demi Gorgon.
11469380	11473860	I've seen a bad dragon dildo of the Demi Gorgon. What? I don't even want to know what that is.
11473860	11476900	I don't want to know. I don't know what that is. I don't know what that is. You're not gonna
11476980	11483060	explain. Wait, can you link it? Link, it's a tie. Okay, I got you. Hold on. Not to me.

11494260	11504100	wrongs. No, don't curl chai. I just want to watch it. Don't curl chai. I want it.
11506980	11513460	I don't think this is gonna make any sense, but I did have, I do can recall that I had a big crush
11513460	11527460	on this cat. This cat? Get that out of my DMs right now. Get that out of my DMs right now.
11527460	11536100	Get that out of my DMs right now. I deleted it. You sick one. What did I tell you? I told
11536100	11541540	you no. I don't want to see it. What cat? Let's just change the subject. Now what kind of
11541540	11548100	you sick bastard? No, she's my friend. She's my friend. She's my friend. She's my friend.
11548100	11557620	Why is she your friend? Why is she your friend? Is that the cat from Franklin? No, this is a cat from
11557620	11565380	Little Bear. Oh, oh. That's not Little Bear. Chai. Chai. Why is it cat?
11567300	11572820	It was more, I think that's a thing. I think it's personality. I think I don't have a physical
11572820	11578100	type. I think that's the problem. They could be a cat. They could be a cow. They could be a cucumber.
11578820	11580820	Do you know the dog from Lady and the Tramp?
11581780	11587460	Uh, yeah. I had a question. The dog, like the lady's love interest, I don't know.
11589140	11593460	He went to do everything to be with her, man. I kind of liked it. Wait, what dog? Oh,
11593460	11598020	Bolts? The dog from Lady and the Tramp. Oh, I thought, sorry, I thought you meant Bolts.
11599220	11606740	Oh, but yes. Uh, Tramp, yeah. I thought he was very attractive. And he loved Lady very much,
11606980	11613940	yes. Oh, yeah. Very cute. There's the pure love that I like. Yeah, they were, like,
11613940	11620660	different classes. It was very adorable. Now I'm a sucker for the Juliet, Romeo and Juliet type
11620660	11630740	of trope. Someone's a sucker for that. I love there so much. Someone said bubble baths from Spongebob.
11631540	11636900	No. No, no, no, no. Okay. Who do you like from Spongebob?
11638660	11644100	I like the guy in the Spongebob movie that was like the bounty hunter that was hunting them down
11644100	11648580	with the really nice boots. Oh, yeah. I forgot about him.
11651220	11657540	Dennis, yeah. I didn't have a crush on the Spongebob characters. I was ship in Spongebob.
11657780	11664180	We were just ship in them. Maybe the robot lady, the wife. Oh, Karen?
11664180	11669940	Karen, yeah. I like the wife. David Hasselhoff. I don't know. David Hasselhoff.
11669940	11674020	There hasn't been like, oh, what anime characters do you guys resonate with? Like, what kind of,
11674020	11678500	like, oh, this is so- Do I kid? Yeah, like, who do you kid? Who do you guys see? Who do you guys
11678500	11686420	kid? Who's your kid? Who's your kid? Who's your kid? I haven't kidned a anime character in a very long
11686420	11692500	time. And I usually watch my first kid. I think my, my head always goes to tiger,
11692500	11701460	icica, icica, icica, icica, icica. Icicle, yeah. Icicle, tiger. Like, that's like always,
11701460	11709700	I can't, it's like uncontrollable, but I think like Toru, Toru Honda.
11710260	11721380	I'd have to think about mine. Yeah, I have to think. I couldn't really like kid myself,
11721380	11725940	because I have to, I feel like I have to relate to a character, and I don't really feel like I
11725940	11730580	really relate it, especially with the anime I watched. I usually used anime as a form of
11730580	11736980	escapism. I didn't want anything to remind me of my life. Oh, that, yeah. I usually watch like
11736980	11742260	super, I never watched like slice of life stuff. I watched like super high fantasy stuff, or like
11742260	11749780	sci-fi, or just like fucking, I was just watching Naruto and Full Metal Alchemist and all the time,
11749780	11759940	and I like, yeah, I can't. Oh, I liked Alphonse from Full Metal Alchemist. Is that your kid?
11759940	11765940	Suit of armor. No, he's not my kin, but like, I liked him. Oh, you liked him? Oh, okay.
11765940	11771540	Suki from Avatar, who I want to be. Oh yeah, I feel that. I don't know. I don't know who I can,
11771540	11777140	I'm not gonna say it all out though. I thought you guys would answer too. Is it like a weird? I don't
11777140	11781540	know if I have any like weird ones. I think most of them are like pretty, pretty, like sound like
11781540	11792900	pretty like normal. Um, I'm gonna keep her to myself. She's your, your anime Oshii. Um, let me see.
11797780	11803860	Oh my god. What is it, kin? It's just like a, it's a nerd term to me. I can't do like super
11804100	11809220	really, too. You're like, oh, this is me and I am them. They are me. We are one. We are Venom.
11810180	11818100	Of course, I'm Venom. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. What's the tongue do? No, no, not the tongue. It wasn't
11818100	11822820	the tongue. It was just the fact that he was like a symbiote. Yeah. And I was like, what would he
11822820	11829380	feel like if he was inside of me, but not like in a weird way and like, in like a, like in a symbiote
11829460	11835620	suit kind of way. Okay. I think, I think I actually might have kin death the kid.
11837300	11843620	Yes, yes, yes. Wait, me too, me too, me too. Because I have OCD and so I like really related
11843620	11849380	with this character because for obsession with symmetry and stuff. Yeah. Oh, I fucking love
11849380	11855460	Solator. Solator was my shit. I had so many OCs. I was very much obsessed with that the kid. I think
11855460	11859780	I related to him a lot. Yeah, I want to say that. It's like, I can always, I was like,
11859780	11864820	I feel like it's like, I like a character so much I want to be them or like, I'm like, that's so me.
11864820	11869860	Yeah. So me for real, for real. That's so me. That's me for real. Let's be for real. Let's be for
11869860	11878260	real. I can the dune worm. What the fuck are you doing? What's dune? You don't know what dune is?
11878980	11884580	No. It's a book. It's a sci-fi book. I don't know if you, I don't think you would like it at all
11884580	11891540	actually or even the movie. I don't only think it's your thing. Nope. Yeah. I like that. Also,
11891540	11897540	I don't even know how to read properly. I think I'm like genuinely dyslexic. So that's okay. Oh,
11897540	11904580	I know what my, my first, my first kid where I was like, really obsessed with the character and I
11904580	11909940	was like, Oh my God, I want that to be me so bad. I wanted it to be me. It was Asuna from Sword Art
11909940	11917780	on the line. Oh, I feel it. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mine's with, mine's with Sasuke. Oh, really? Okay.
11917780	11923460	Yeah, that's good. Mine's with Sasuke. I'm on the line. What was an anime you wish you were in the
11923460	11930180	world in? Like, like, sword art, sword art. Yeah. Mine was, I don't really think it was an anime,
11930180	11936500	but I really wish I was in Code Lyoko. Wait, what's that? You don't know what Code Lyoko is? Am I,
11936740	11943780	I don't know. So Code Lyoko is this show where these kids go to like school,
11943780	11948020	but then there's this like this master computer that like tries to fucking kill them every day.
11948020	11953620	Why are there four heads so big? Yeah, they fucking use four heads. But they go into the computer to
11953620	11960500	fight, like it's like reset time. And so they just reset time all the time. I just fucking love Code
11960500	11966260	Lyoko. That was my shit. Wait, someone says I don't blame TV. I can understand that. I wanted to,
11966260	11973380	I, odd, odd was my, oh, I fucking was in love with odd, which was like the cat, the cat boy.
11974740	11978980	Oh, wait, I want to look it up now. How do you spell it? It was a really weird
11980340	11988580	art style, but yeah, Code Lyoko Ly, okay. Code Lyoko is French. Yes, it's originally French.
11988580	11995460	It's so interesting. But I love Bible Villaco. The thing that I wanted to be in, I'm trying to think.
11995460	12002100	I wanted to be in Code Lyoko and you know Naruto naturally. Either Yvonne Gellor the persona series,
12002100	12010980	yeah, yeah. I know I would die though, but um, oh yeah, I don't know, man.
12010980	12015980	Corks party, I'm lying, maybe Corks party, you wanna be a Corks party?
12015980	12020980	No, you could not, you would die so fast.
12020980	12022980	That's terrible.
12022980	12023980	Why?
12023980	12030980	Because Kauru isn't Eva, and I was obsessed with him.
12030980	12039980	But now, I'm gonna have a Corks party, I'm built different, I'm gonna fucking, I'm gonna walk out of there alive, not a scratch on my body.
12039980	12046980	I'm already very mentally disturbed.
12046980	12050980	Have you done a playthrough of Corks party on your channel?
12050980	12052980	Not on my channel, I've played it before though.
12052980	12056980	Oh, okay, cause I'm like, let me know when you do, cause I wanna watch it then.
12056980	12063980	Yeah, yeah, if I do I'll let you know, but if I was physically there, that little girl, that little girl was getting punted.
12063980	12065980	Oh my god.
12066980	12070980	Oh man, that'd be fun, aren't there making a two or something I've seen?
12070980	12073980	Yeah, they're redoing it, they're making a new game.
12073980	12083980	It's the buttered pooper, I totally forgot, cause I made the buttered pooper references before and I forgot it was from Corks party, such a great fucking game.
12083980	12086980	And Madfather, I loved all those RPG maker games.
12086980	12089980	What is your favorite visual novel, Nori?
12089980	12091980	Sorry.
12091980	12098980	Mmm.
12098980	12099980	What?
12099980	12102980	They said nori, they said Nori.
12102980	12104980	Oh, don't look it up, maggot beach.
12104980	12106980	What?
12106980	12109980	Don't look it up, don't do it, there's no better chair.
12109980	12111980	I think I've heard of that.
12111980	12114980	How do I spell it? Or send it?
12114980	12116980	I don't care.
12116980	12117980	I want to
12117980	12122980	You might not like it, but I won't like it
12122980	12125980	A clapjack just said, oh, mega beat
12125980	12127980	I've heard of that, what is that?
12127980	12131980	But if you want like a normie, a normie taste
12131980	12133980	Um, Totono?
12133980	12135980	Is it my one of my favorite ones?
12135980	12137980	I think it's very beautifully done
12137980	12139980	So I really like this one
12140980	12142980	Oh, I'm Sayushi! I'm Sayushi!
12142980	12144980	Sayushi's also really good
12144980	12146980	I'm going to mess up now
12146980	12148980	Wait, hold on, raid, raid, moment, raid, moment
12148980	12149980	Another one?
12149980	12150980	I'll try
12150980	12152980	Another one, oh my god, another one
12152980	12153980	Give me a second
12153980	12155980	She's popular, she's cool
12156980	12158980	I put maggot balls on accident
12158980	12160980	It's maggot beads
12160980	12162980	So it's maggot beads, Totono
12162980	12163980	Oh
12163980	12166980	And Sayushi is really good too
12167980	12170980	The girl's eye is being popped out of its socket
12170980	12171980	Yep
12171980	12173980	There's titties in this screen
12173980	12174980	Yep
12174980	12175980	Yep
12175980	12177980	What is this, it's like
12179980	12181980	Oh, why? I like it so much
12181980	12183980	I think it's just maybe like the art
12183980	12186980	And stuff is like really like
12186980	12188980	Interesting
12189980	12191980	I don't know, I'm like, I'm a huge sucker for like
12191980	12193980	Very unique art styles, yeah
12193980	12195980	Yeah, I'm not averse to like gore
12195980	12197980	And just like dark themes
12197980	12199980	So I'm actually like, I'm not
12199980	12202980	I'm not really a visual novel person
12203980	12204980	Really
12204980	12206980	You could just watch a play through of it
12206980	12209980	Yeah, maybe I might do that
12209980	12212980	I usually will just read manga
12212980	12215980	But I haven't even read manga in a long time
12215980	12219980	Yeah, consuming Japanese media
12219980	12221980	Has mostly been for me, just like anime
12221980	12224980	But I usually watch normie animes, so
12224980	12227980	I would recommend visual novels if you want like a little base tea
12227980	12228980	Some of them are pretty simple
12228980	12230980	You're just literally just reading and like
12230980	12231980	Picking an option
12231980	12232980	Yeah, it's like just
12232980	12234980	And you can also Google options
12234980	12236980	If you just want to like, if you just want to like
12236980	12238980	Have a specific ending done
12238980	12239980	Things like that
12240980	12241980	I think too hard
12241980	12243980	What is it?
12243980	12245980	Anyone here watched Food Wars?
12245980	12247980	Why did you say it like that?
12248980	12249980	Never heard of it
12249980	12251980	I don't know what you're talking about
12251980	12252980	What's Food Wars?
12252980	12254980	Yeah, never, yeah, exactly
12254980	12256980	Yeah, I actually don't know what that is
12256980	12257980	I'm so hurry
12257980	12258980	Hi son
12258980	12260980	I just told you I like the maggot baits
12260980	12262980	Why the fuck would I look at something that's called
12262980	12264980	Food Wars?
12264980	12267980	Do you think I'm a normal person now buddy?
12267980	12269980	I'm like an edged lord
12269980	12272980	Call me Sasuke Uchiha
12272980	12274980	Noriko Uchiha
12274980	12276980	Noriko Uchiha
12276980	12278980	Honestly, kind of a badass name
12278980	12279980	Yeah, it's my new name now
12279980	12281980	I know man, can you re-brand to that?
12281980	12283980	Visual novels often have late scenes though
12283980	12285980	Yeah, but if you get them through Steam
12285980	12287980	You're like centered so hard
12287980	12289980	So it doesn't even matter
12289980	12290980	I've heard that
12290980	12292980	Yeah, the stuff is centered
12292980	12294980	Yeah, but visual novels
12294980	12297980	I think are very worth to even just look at
12297980	12300980	So if you ever want a visual novel recommendation
12300980	12302980	I will
12302980	12304980	I can look and I'll send you some
12305980	12306980	Thank you
12308980	12311980	Alright, it is almost 1.30 a.m. for me
12311980	12313980	Call me Puppies, yeah it is
12313980	12315980	Yeah, I'm Epi
12315980	12317980	I'm also really a fucking piss
12317980	12319980	I'm waiting for Chyna to come back
12319980	12320980	Oh, she's here
12320980	12321980	Hi, I'm here, I'm sorry
12321980	12323980	I heard you say you're Epi and have to pee
12323980	12325980	Yeah, I need to run
12326980	12328980	I was hoping you didn't catch that
12328980	12329980	Hello
12329980	12330980	Hi
12330980	12332980	Welcome Raiders
12332980	12333980	Wait, Chyna
12333980	12334980	Yes, Raiders
12334980	12335980	More Raiders?
12335980	12337980	Oh no, it's the same
12337980	12339980	Yeah, I was saying hi to her Raiders
12339980	12343980	Wait Chy, are all the people you put on the stream right now
12343980	12345980	People you found attractive?
12345980	12347980	No, no, no
12347980	12352980	Okay, so the top left is apparently I sound like her
12352980	12353980	Yeah, yeah, yeah
12353980	12356980	Freeran Shrek, that's just like a visual image
12356980	12357980	For everyone to know
12357980	12359980	And then that's your crush
12359980	12361980	Right there beside them
12361980	12363980	And then this is Shibi's crush
12363980	12366980	And then it's my crush in front of chat
12366980	12367980	Okay, okay, okay
12367980	12369980	I'm so curious
12369980	12372980	I learned so much about Noriko today
12372980	12373980	Yeah
12373980	12374980	I'm a pretty open bloke
12374980	12376980	We learned so much about each other
12378980	12381980	I think we all have very similar but different tastes in movies
12381980	12382980	Yes
12382980	12385980	And same opinions, but I enjoy that a lot
12385980	12387980	Coral is a damn good villain
12388980	12390980	Coral is a very good villain
12390980	12394980	If you watch the movie, I recommend watching it in Spanish
12394980	12396980	It just sounds a lot better
12396980	12400980	There's some videos that are just better in Spanish than in English
12402980	12405980	Yeah, I think all of them don't chat
12405980	12408980	I'm trying to figure out who to read
12408980	12409980	Oh my god, we're gonna read
12409980	12410980	Read me, read me
12410980	12411980	I can't read
12411980	12412980	I got
12412980	12413980	Are you on YouTube?
12414980	12415980	No
12416980	12418980	You can't do that
12418980	12420980	I'm like, are you dual streaming?
12420980	12421980	Cause then I would
12421980	12425980	One day, one day, one day, one day, one day, one day, one day
