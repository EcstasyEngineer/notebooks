0	5520	It's weird being in voice chat and not being allowed to spell all the secrets of what I've got planned.
5520	7040	Oh no, it's starting!
7040	7760	It's starting!
7760	8560	It's starting!
9280	9920	Here, here.
10640	12320	Oh, so excited.
12320	13840	Did it just pause? It says three.
16480	17440	Yeah, it's supposed to.
19680	20400	Uh-oh.
20400	20800	Oh no!
22720	24160	Oh, oh, okay.
25360	26000	Oh, wait.
26720	29040	Technical difficulties, it's fine lives, it's fine, Luna.
29120	30160	It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.
34640	36000	They're so cute, I can't.
39040	40160	Wait, I'm gonna unmute.
40160	46080	I just realized I've not got desktop audio in their split, so I can't hear the streaming you guys can.
48560	50160	How did you guys split the audio?
50160	52160	I've got you guys captured via desktop.
53360	56640	Oh, you have to, you have to make, um, what's it called?
57360	58000	A split.
58640	61360	Yeah, you guys split in OBS so you can do it.
61360	62240	Yeah, that's what I did.
62240	63440	I have two tips.
63440	65680	I have my headset and my IEMs right now.
67440	68640	Oh no.
68640	69440	I hear them.
71920	75200	I've bowled this watch a long time ago, that's all I can say so far.
83120	86960	I'll mute it once they finish their intro.
88000	94960	Oh.
101440	102000	Hello.
104720	105280	Gushy.
105920	106960	Gushy.
106960	107280	Right.
107280	107920	Gushy.
108720	109440	Gishy, Gishy.
110560	113600	I'm like, I got two things she could gush on right here.
118880	121440	Oh, everyone says it's very sweet.
121440	122800	They helped with the watch along.
122800	124480	I know they're helping them with a big concert.
125200	125760	Yeah.
125760	128640	Hey, man, you scratch our back, we scratch yours.
128640	130560	That's how we do it from around these parts.
138560	140000	Mimosa's a good singer.
141040	141360	Yeah.
142320	144240	Dude, Mimosa's so talented.
144240	144800	She is.
145360	147760	I actually got them lungs on her just hiding.
147760	149120	You wouldn't realize.
149120	150560	Don't be fooled by the outfit.
150560	151680	There's lungs under this.
151680	152160	I know.
160640	161760	Damn.
175760	177840	Her model's so bouncy.
178640	179040	It is.
179040	179760	I love that.
187520	188880	I love the way eyelashes.
188880	192320	I know it's not a V-tube or mainstream, but I know.
192320	194080	I was just like strawberries.
194080	195040	I want to eat them.
196400	197920	The flowers in her ears.
197920	198480	I just let's.
199920	200880	It's a different place.
200880	201840	So nice.
205520	210880	Oh, the breadsticks in chat.
211920	212160	Oh.
221920	223120	I like her custom mic.
224720	225600	I didn't even notice.
225600	227440	Oh, it's really cool.
228640	230960	God, I was talking about customized assets today,
230960	232800	and I was like, I never got girls anything.
233760	234160	It was OK.
234960	237920	I was just like, that was, it sounds terrible.
237920	239680	I was like, if I'm not going to use it,
239680	241120	I'm not giving it to them.
242640	245680	Because I showed my end in screen for like the first time
245680	248400	and literally since debut, I showed my end in screen
248400	249360	and everyone was laughing.
252960	254800	Why do you hate the ending screen so much?
255920	258080	I just ends.
258080	259280	She just leaves.
259280	260560	I don't like heart screams.
260560	262400	Literally, if you open up one of my boards,
262480	267520	I'm just like, I don't know.
267520	269120	I literally spent so much money on it.
270320	271440	I just never use the thing.
271440	272800	I've never even seen the stingers.
272800	274320	I never even used stingers on debut.
274320	275680	That's so much I hate them as well.
275680	276880	So I'm showing them the debut.
280320	281680	God, this is fantastic.
282080	285440	This is beyond my expectations.
286400	287840	Mom, this is amazing.
287840	290160	She's like an amazing, amazing singer.
290880	292400	Multi, multi, multi-talented.
293200	294000	Extremely.
294640	295520	Things, streams.
298080	299760	Freaking makes all her own charts as well.
300640	301120	Thumbnails.
302000	302480	You name it.
302480	302960	She does it.
303520	304320	She does them all.
304960	306160	You didn't know she sings.
306800	308880	Well, I'm supposed to keep up with everyone's talents
308880	311200	and the VTuber roster that I'm not aware of.
311200	312320	That's what I thought we'd be from.
313920	316560	You're not constantly stalking when most is channeling me.
317520	319440	Well, that's why I'm supposed to know absolutely everything
319440	323600	about every other VTuber that's been kind enough
323600	324400	to interact with me.
324400	324800	That's right.
324800	326240	You're done for a reason bend over.
328960	329840	Prepare yourself.
332640	333200	What was it?
333200	333680	Tyler.
333680	334240	Hello, everybody.
334240	334880	Hi, Harold.
335600	336800	Something is in my eye.
338320	338800	My eye.
341840	343440	Well, we have a peak refunds.
347080	348960	So I'm surfing the teeth.
348960	350240	Anyone can hear that?
350880	351360	No, I don't.
357520	358000	OK.
359840	360400	Meru!
360640	362080	freak A1 your custom microphone.
364000	367440	Oh, my gosh.
374800	375200	Oh, she's insane.
375200	381200	Oh my god, duet!
381200	386440	Oh my god, how long is this concert?
386440	388640	That is like some built-in and pre-pro-new-
388640	392720	I'm like generally so impressed with the most of his voice in Burroughs.
392720	393720	Me too!
393720	395720	I wish I could speak Japanese!
395720	399720	Imagine us up there.
399720	400720	Konichiwawa.
400720	401720	Konichiwawa.
402720	403720	Konichiwawa.
411720	413720	I forget singing in English.
413720	416720	I can even imagine singing in a different language.
416720	417720	Exactly.
420720	424720	I think we got to get some Japanese speakers for Gen 2, mommy.
425720	427720	We're being influenced live.
427720	429720	You heard it here, folks.
431720	434720	I saw what you tweeted, Chibi.
434720	435720	I don't think I didn't see it.
435720	438720	She went on Twitter and she tweeted a sling girl.
438720	440720	Aw, don't look at me.
440720	442720	I'm not doing nothing.
442720	444720	I freaking saw it.
444720	448720	I'm just slowly just putting it into your mind.
448720	454720	I will get you a Halloween variation outfit of you as a sling girl.
454720	455720	Absolutely.
455720	456720	Yeah?
456720	457720	All yours.
457720	460720	I'm not having an actual sling girl.
460720	461720	All yours.
461720	462720	Yeah!
462720	464720	I'm giving the sling girl!
464720	465720	Yes.
465720	466720	All right.
466720	467720	I'll settle.
467720	468720	I'll settle for that.
468720	469720	I'm the sling girl.
469720	470720	We've defeated the sling allegation.
470720	471720	Yeah!
471720	472720	I'm so...
472720	473720	I'm trying not to scream.
473720	476720	I'm trying to focus on the thing because I'm about to get real giddy.
476720	477720	Things are jiggling on screen.
477720	481720	I don't know if what you guys are looking at, but things are jiggling to me.
481720	486720	Two things are jiggling.
486720	494720	Slime bunny girl, like from Queen's Blade, precisely.
494720	497720	A cotton bum family member is going to be the slime girl.
497720	501720	I'll have to think about that.
501720	502720	Sublime.
502720	503720	She's slimy.
503720	504720	What are you doing?
504720	505720	Shebeth the Slime.
505720	506720	Shebeth the Slime.
506720	507720	Oh my god.
507720	509720	Look at her little freaking...
509720	513720	Look at her little pony tails, Bob.
513720	514720	Yaeli.
514720	517720	Yaeli fish ribbons as well, like the translucent.
517720	519720	Such a good design.
519720	522720	Unfortunately, it's my turn to sing.
522720	523720	Hold on.
523720	524720	Let me get my pen lights out.
524720	525720	No!
525720	530720	No eye moner.
530720	532720	Should we get eye trackers?
532720	533720	I'll do that.
533720	538720	I'll give every girl an eye tracker and we'll watch the most devious videos and stuff.
538720	548720	And then we'll see who's got like 93% pervert rate.
548720	549720	Why is Mamosa so good?
549720	558720	Mamosa, why is Mero so good?
558720	562720	Did they die?
562720	565720	Oh, discord crashed.
565720	567720	Sorry, I died.
567720	582720	I'm asking Mero if she wants to go up on stage because she's watching this.
582720	586720	I think her makes fucking dying.
586720	592720	Yeah, we can't really hear you.
592720	596720	Azura, are you alive?
596720	597720	I'm fine.
597720	598720	I'm fine.
598720	599720	I'll take that.
599720	600720	She's so excited.
600720	602720	She's so, so excited to get on stage.
602720	603720	She just ran away.
603720	608720	She's like at the thought, at the concert.
608720	611720	Let me get two pen lights out.
611720	612720	I don't have different colors.
612720	613720	I only have blue.
613720	617720	I have so many questions for them about how long this took.
617720	618720	This is insane.
618720	619720	I know.
620720	627720	They should just like take the soundtracks here and just post them as song covers too.
627720	628720	Honestly, that's a smart idea.
628720	629720	I think they should.
629720	631720	I think they will.
631720	632720	You think they will?
632720	633720	I hope so.
633720	634720	Because it's really good.
634720	636720	They shouldn't just leave it here on the stream.
636720	640720	I want full song covers.
640720	643720	Let us hear your lungs.
643720	646720	This tiny jellyfish got lungs on her too.
646720	648720	God dang.
648720	660720	Azura is singing along to it.
660720	663720	I think that's why she's muted.
663720	664720	Damn.
664720	674720	That's where you're not beating the weave allegations.
674720	679720	This concert is epic.
679720	680720	Literally.
680720	682720	I had no idea what to expect.
682720	685720	I've never actually sat through it.
685720	693720	This is so cool.
693720	696720	Uncle, give us another mate.
696720	699720	I don't know why this creature is dying for me.
699720	701720	It's hard to know.
701720	703720	I'm just so surprised at the stage.
703720	708720	All the assets.
708720	712720	The light show.
712720	713720	It's really pretty.
713720	715720	Mara is so cute.
715720	721720	She is.
721720	724720	This is so cool.
724720	727720	She has her tentacles bounce.
727720	730720	Is Azura's mute at the audio?
730720	732720	She's going to get coffee.
732720	737720	I mean.
737720	743720	The reminder not to play the audio of the stream.
743720	745720	On stream.
745720	750720	Question of those headlights being held up by my arms.
750720	760720	Oh, this goes hard.
760720	767720	Got a different vibe.
767720	772720	If I'm he started singing in Japanese, I would have absolutely lost my mind.
772720	776720	Wait, is she about to?
776720	782720	I think this is an English cover.
782720	785720	If you guys had to sing a song for a concert, what would you sing?
785720	786720	That's my question.
786720	791720	I would rap something ridiculous.
791720	805720	ABC's.
805720	814720	Sing five bars, five seconds.
814720	817720	Two in your mom live edition.
817720	823720	Why does this court keep shitting the bed?
823720	826720	Lincoln Park calling you.
826720	828720	There you go.
828720	830720	I streamed a fish.
830720	832720	I probably do American.
832720	844720	I like green.
844720	845720	Okay.
845720	847720	I may go off.
847720	848720	Hit him.
848720	849720	Hit him.
849720	850720	Hit him.
850720	851720	Hit him.
851720	853720	Hey, don't hurt him now.
853720	857720	Kill him.
857720	870720	That's so cool.
870720	878720	Oh, no, she's hot.
878720	887720	I just set the ambiance.
887720	888720	Feel that music.
888720	896720	Feel them tunes.
896720	897720	I saw it.
897720	898720	I saw it.
898720	899720	Execute me.
899720	900720	I me.
900720	906720	I don't know if you guys have ever played Alice Madness Returns, but when you get low health,
906720	912720	you enter a state of hysteria and you unlock a different version like to your look.
912720	917720	And this I me is like completely making me want to play Alice Madness Returns right now.
917720	918720	That's a great game.
918720	919720	I've heard of that game.
919720	921720	I want to play it too.
921720	922720	Oh, I recommend.
922720	923720	I me darkness way.
923720	924720	Yeah.
924720	926720	I me darkness dementia way.
926720	928720	Just like my immortal.
928720	931720	I love her mic too.
931720	933720	All the song choices are really good too.
933720	935720	They're all catchy.
935720	945720	I'm in.
945720	955720	Oh, shit.
955720	961720	Execution.
961720	972720	I'm too more to add them to the rest.
972720	973720	Three.
973720	974720	Whoa.
974720	977720	They're all singing together.
977720	980720	Are there songs that support this?
980720	982720	What is it?
982720	985720	Oh, wait.
985720	987720	This is crazy.
987720	1004720	It's not just like one solo song or do it.
1004720	1009720	Let's go.
1009720	1014720	Oh my gosh.
1014720	1015720	Okay.
1016720	1031720	Oh my gosh.
1031720	1033720	YouTube does need anime emotes.
1033720	1036720	Someone's using a pickle instead of the baguettes.
1036720	1048720	Put your pickle away.
1048720	1052720	I love Amara bounces her little tentacle ponytails.
1052720	1060720	Yay.
1060720	1064720	I must have taken so much work to practice.
1064720	1067720	I have so many questions for them after this.
1067720	1069720	Like, holy crap.
1069720	1070720	I'm sorry.
1070720	1072720	I'm not singing in Japanese.
1072720	1074720	No, I'm not going to ask you to.
1074720	1075720	Holy crap.
1075720	1078720	I would never ask you to sing in another language.
1078720	1082720	Japanese fans would hate me because I would just butcher everything.
1082720	1084720	Because I would not be able to.
1084720	1086720	This is so beautiful and amazing.
1086720	1088720	I'm sorry, but.
1088720	1090720	I should have said sorry.
1090720	1098720	I'll do Megan the stallion song.
1098720	1101720	What does she want?
1101720	1107720	I didn't hear that new one from Megan the stallion.
1107720	1110720	I forgot the name of the faking song.
1110720	1112720	I already forgot the name of the song too.
1112720	1114720	I was listening to it this morning.
1114720	1117720	It's your time up.
1117720	1120720	I need some Japanese songs to sing.
1120720	1122720	Japanese?
1122720	1126720	That's okay.
1126720	1131720	I'll sing that part of it.
1131720	1133720	What's up?
1133720	1135720	It happens by own words.
1135720	1138720	And the birds and the eagles.
1138720	1140720	I will sing that version.
1140720	1150720	Some of the uptails on it that aren't real words.
1150720	1153720	I just want to smush her little face.
1153720	1158720	She gives me cute aggression.
1158720	1161720	I have seen the Japanese version of Doja Cat say so.
1161720	1163720	It is very good.
1163720	1167720	It's very cute.
1167720	1170720	I'm making the Scottish version and getting a million views.
1170720	1173720	You should.
1173720	1177720	In the moment, I want to say so.
1177720	1180720	I love this song.
1180720	1183720	I just got shivers.
1183720	1186720	Her voice is so clear.
1186720	1201720	I'm getting shivers from her singing.
1201720	1204720	If you guys want to do song collabs,
1204720	1207720	I can set the other VTubers for you.
1207720	1212720	That would be fun.
1212720	1215720	I love this song.
1215720	1218720	Do you want to sing magnet with me?
1218720	1221720	Vocaloid magnet?
1221720	1224720	I don't know what that is.
1224720	1227720	Am I aging myself right now?
1227720	1230720	No.
1230720	1232720	Let me look it up.
1232720	1235720	Maybe I'm forgetting the name.
1235720	1237720	Miku.
1237720	1240720	And forbidden lovers.
1240720	1242720	I've never heard this one.
1242720	1244720	No.
1244720	1246720	You've never heard magnet?
1246720	1249720	No.
1249720	1252720	It's from Chibi Collab.
1252720	1255720	Jason.
1255720	1258720	Do you want to do magnet with me?
1258720	1261720	You're asking the wrong one.
1261720	1265720	You were singing a
1265720	1268720	Ed Sheeran's thing of the whole bit.
1268720	1271720	My voice is so broken.
1271720	1274720	We have mixers.
1274720	1277720	We'll do a recorded concert.
1277720	1280720	I'm just a me.
1280720	1283720	You did not even sound like that.
1283720	1286720	Come off it.
1286720	1289720	Come off it now.
1289720	1292720	There you use these
1292720	1295720	terminologies again.
1295720	1298720	I'll make a comment.
1298720	1301720	I'll be very interested to see
1301720	1304720	how your accent would develop.
1304720	1307720	Chibi had never done it before until
1307720	1310720	debut.
1310720	1313720	Then we did the debut mock and she goes
1313720	1316720	Arise.
1316720	1319720	Where did this come from?
1319720	1322720	I was studying.
1322720	1331720	I was, I was, uh, holding my inner Scott since I'm Scottish myself and my mom's side and my mom's side.
1331720	1336720	Oh, you're more hen. I probably can or then.
1336720	1341720	I didn't. Yeah, my great-grandmother immigrated from Scotland. I didn't even know that.
1341720	1345720	That's so cool. I'm here for it.
1345720	1351720	Oh, she got her love eyes on. She got her love eyes on.
1351720	1356720	Hell yeah. Go little joke. Go little joke. Go little joke. Go.
1356720	1361720	My jokes.
1361720	1363720	The song is really good.
1363720	1369720	Maybe like the song.
1369720	1374720	Is this where I see it in me that her song's being mixed right now?
1374720	1377720	Oh, it's, that's Fortnite Battle Pass.
1377720	1380720	You're doing Fortnite Battle Pass as a,
1380720	1384720	I don't even know what to tell them what the plan was.
1384720	1386720	Go ahead.
1386720	1391720	So I really like Amy's voice and I wanted her to make a meme song cover.
1391720	1398720	And the one song I really wanted her to cover is the song that's Fortnite Metal Pass.
1398720	1409720	That'll go viral. I'll tell you that right now. This is my prediction.
1409720	1416720	She was alive while she was away on holiday, but unfortunately we were having a lot of delay issues just everywhere.
1416720	1423720	But she drew her own artwork for it. I'm getting it animated and then it's been turned into a little cute video,
1423720	1426720	but it's less than a minute long, so I'm going to get it into...
1426720	1427720	They're together!
1427720	1428720	Sorry.
1428720	1433720	Because she cut herself off.
1433720	1436720	Yeah, Rhea!
1436720	1440720	We stan Vocaloid. Shadow Wizard Money Gang.
1440720	1442720	We love Vocaloid.
1442720	1448720	Oh my God, Rain's voice is so mummy.
1448720	1451720	I love that Rain has like a slight valley accent.
1451720	1452720	Does she?
1452720	1453720	Yeah.
1453720	1456720	I didn't notice.
1456720	1458720	It's very, very slight.
1458720	1460720	It fits her model so well though.
1460720	1461720	It does.
1461720	1463720	I actually just wanted to really...
1463720	1464720	Did these were jumping?
1464720	1466720	Sorry, I'm a child. I'm an absolute child.
1466720	1467720	Forgive me.
1467720	1471720	Forgive me.
1471720	1474720	Veiler Fortnite skins? Absolutely not.
1474720	1475720	Could you imagine?
1475720	1483720	It was like cash money flow emo on someone after you kill them and it's just Emmys fans.
1483720	1490720	She's in her jays like dancing over the cars with someone because she got first place.
1490720	1493720	Oh my God.
1493720	1497720	Oh, I would do an Arata Shigako song.
1497720	1501720	I really like Tokyo Calling because it's about...
1501720	1503720	You're going to say Tokyo Drift.
1503720	1510720	No, no, no. It's called Tokyo Calling and it's about how dystopian your life can become
1510720	1515720	if you don't kind of find the meaning of it or that's what I took away from it and it's like...
1515720	1518720	One of the lines that really resonates me is like...
1518720	1521720	They're singing magnet? Are they?
1521720	1522720	Shut up.
1522720	1524720	I'm going to lose it.
1524720	1529720	They are singing magnet. Oh my God, I'm literally going to cry.
1529720	1532720	This is one of my favorite Vocaloid songs.
1532720	1534720	Oh my God, actually.
1534720	1537720	I'm geeking out. I'm geeking.
1537720	1539720	Riefland's almost... I was actually...
1539720	1545720	Hatsune Miku was my entrance into the anime world to say the things. I said what I said.
1545720	1548720	Are they going to do the Japanese or the English version?
1548720	1550720	That's my question.
1550720	1551720	The world?
1551720	1553720	Oh, they're doing the Japanese.
1563720	1568720	Duuu duuu duuu duuu duuu duuu duu duuu duuu duuu duuu duuu duaa duuu duuu duuu duuu duuu duuu hello.
1568720	1569720	Creaming your jarts.
1569720	1571720	They were creamed long ago. Thank you.
1571720	1573720	Reia's voice.
1578720	1581720	I love Reia's singing voice. Oh my God.
1581720	1583720	She sounds so like...
1583720	1586720	It's a little bit more mature. It's so clear and smooth.
1586720	1588720	I think almost ethereal. You know that?
1588720	1591720	Yeah, absolutely. Every time she opens, she sings, it gives me servers.
1591720	1611200	servers. Oh, this takes me back.
1621720	1643200	I'm so happy right now. I like
1643200	1644560	Rains Mike. Mom, can we get
1644560	1648560	mics? Okay, get makes. Actually,
1649200	1650480	this is insider knowledge. You
1650480	1651320	guys aren't supposed to know
1651320	1653320	this, but you can't keep a secret
1653320	1654600	for the life of you. I started
1654600	1658000	it. I was like, oh, everyone
1658000	1658960	else can know that's listening
1658960	1660400	into a I haven't met any of the
1660400	1661800	girls in August and they can
1662320	1664000	have we are going to discuss
1664000	1668240	alternative outfits. Well, I
1668240	1669320	already know I'm getting slime.
1670480	1671520	Well, that's for Halloween. But
1671520	1673800	like Halloween. Oh, shit. I'm
1673800	1675200	under way. Oh, God. Well, you
1675200	1676320	just said we're gonna be for
1676320	1677480	Halloween. She forgot what she
1677480	1680400	said. If we're doing Halloween
1680400	1682720	costumes, I'm gonna need to fill
1682720	1685560	some string. If you guys want
1685560	1687760	Halloween costumes, you must
1687760	1689680	tell me in the meeting. I want
1689680	1691560	to be a slamber for Halloween.
1695280	1696600	I don't know what I'm going to
1696600	1700360	do for my alternate outfit. I saw
1700360	1703280	you do that. I think I'm going
1703280	1707200	to save the idea for 2.0.
1708080	1711240	Please remember when if you guys
1711240	1712360	would like to sign on for the
1712360	1714080	next year, we also offer a free
1714080	1716360	alternate outfit on the house.
1716360	1718680	So if you have one idea you like,
1718680	1720520	but it's not what you go for, we
1720520	1722720	can probably cover it later.
1723240	1727040	Thanks, Trani. Again, inside
1727040	1730200	your knowledge. If you work
1730200	1731600	under Vealer and sign on for
1731600	1733040	the next year, your split goes
1733040	1734840	up and further 5% in your
1734840	1737200	favor. Oh my gosh.
1742040	1744120	Aren't I just pulling them
1744120	1744760	strings?
1747280	1749360	My ever self sacrificing
1749440	1753440	mother. She's shilling.
1760400	1762120	What do you mean? You don't like
1762120	1763840	the way that we rain cloud?
1765840	1767360	Making kills while watching a
1767360	1768040	concert.
1771920	1773160	Oh, strongy.
1774640	1776320	Make sure she gets so excited.
1776400	1776920	That's why.
1778240	1779840	Bro, I literally leak everything.
1779840	1780840	I like all of this place.
1780840	1784480	I don't know because A.C. is
1784480	1785640	going to be in the meeting about
1785640	1786840	all of this unfolding.
1786840	1788280	So when's that meeting supposed
1788280	1788640	to be?
1789880	1792080	I'll I don't know August 1st.
1792640	1795120	August 1st. I'll just put that
1795120	1796680	down, pencil. Someday.
1803880	1804960	What's the August, September,
1804960	1808880	October? No, I want to.
1811440	1812640	Maybe it was just like short
1812640	1815960	notice. Or maybe she wasn't
1815960	1818560	feeling good. It's a lot.
1818560	1819600	It's a lot of practice.
1820360	1822920	Stress. It is stressful as
1822920	1825240	well. Yeah. Yeah, get all that
1825240	1826080	stuff done.
1832080	1833720	Look at I.B. just bow bobbing
1833720	1834680	up and down. She's like, yep,
1834680	1835840	yep, yep, yep, I'm ready.
1837480	1839120	Of her jacket came comes up
1839120	1839760	with her.
1841600	1842920	And she bubbles.
1845880	1848320	Oh, I love them.
1848960	1850000	Sorry, I'm a wee sump.
1853920	1855400	Yeah, we love we stand Kingdom
1855400	1856360	Hearts in this home.
1858440	1859440	This Kingdom Hearts good. I
1859440	1860240	never had the opportunity.
1860240	1861840	I thought the plan for October
1861840	1863040	was giggle sticks.
1864000	1866840	No, no, no, I had.
1867000	1869120	Oh, my God, the script master
1869120	1870840	got an absolute bolligan and I
1870840	1872280	got a refund on some stuff.
1872400	1873920	Yeah, as you should.
1873920	1875520	I will I'm going to rewrite it
1875520	1876880	myself. I'm not even going to
1877120	1878240	hide you.
1878240	1880360	Well, apparently he might have
1880360	1881320	already rewrote it.
1881320	1883120	I've not looked at it, but I
1883120	1885400	am. I'm I will I'm going to
1885400	1886400	take a peek right now.
1886840	1888040	Yeah, take a peek.
1889120	1890840	He replaced giggle sticks with
1890840	1892040	a light stick.
1893280	1895000	Oh, could you imagine?
1895520	1896840	OK, I stopped meeting in the
1896840	1898760	script now and it's just like
1898960	1900480	fucking substitutes instead.
1902160	1903600	Just rate clock.
1903600	1904520	What?
1904520	1905280	It's going on.
1905320	1906920	Patriot, it's fine.
1907720	1910720	Honestly, the fucking
1911400	1912960	the disc stick on us.
1913960	1915200	Nuzzle Fudge.
1917400	1918720	Awful.
1918720	1920240	OK, literally just took out all
1920240	1921160	of the direction.
1922240	1925280	Oh, is the actual script usable?
1926400	1927880	He left in cock-suckery.
1930080	1931200	Cock-suckery.
1931200	1932960	I mean, if you can overlook that
1932960	1934640	as a script usable question,
1934640	1935520	Mark, we're not going to have to
1935520	1937960	go in and I honestly
1937960	1939120	have been I have a bad taste in
1939120	1939960	my mouth, although I'll talk
1939960	1940400	about this later.
1940400	1941120	We'll talk about this later.
1941120	1942120	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1942120	1943160	Concert, concert, concert.
1943160	1943960	You know, business, business,
1943960	1945840	business, business, business, business.
1946480	1948120	This is a great song, too.
1949480	1951200	My light stick burns brighter than
1951200	1952200	ever.
1954200	1955560	I got my light sticks here.
1957400	1958400	Go off by me.
1960360	1961880	Don't forget to check out the link
1961880	1963800	in the description, guys, because
1963800	1965480	I've got all their links on YouTube.
1965480	1967320	Like, they have worked so hard on
1967320	1969360	this concert, even a cheeky song.
1969360	1971240	And I like on the stream right now.
1971240	1972760	I pinned it in my chat.
1972760	1974320	Just give it a cheeky, like, let
1974320	1975560	them know that I fucking enjoyed
1975560	1976480	this because this is.
1978400	1979680	Like, I know you could argue, oh,
1979680	1980880	they're only singing a three minute
1980880	1983520	song. No, behind the scenes.
1983520	1984720	Are you kidding me?
1984720	1985560	There's so much.
1985560	1986560	So much stuff.
1987840	1989680	All while they were streaming as
1989680	1991160	well in the background, they would
1991160	1993000	have had to have been streaming and
1993000	1994600	then, like, do vocal practice, do

2009080	2010080	time.
2010440	2011440	I hear them.
2011440	2012440	Shut up.
2014000	2015560	That's months of presence.
2015560	2016800	You can see all the reflins in the
2016800	2017800	chat forgetting.
2017800	2018800	Good reflins.
2018800	2020120	I see you well.
2020120	2021600	That's what I like to see.
2021640	2022920	You all get rewarded.
2025640	2027760	Yeah, make sure to click on the link
2027760	2029160	in my chat. Give them a give them a
2029160	2030160	like.
2030160	2031320	So up to their channels, up to the
2031320	2032840	girls. I have very stuff in my
2032840	2034000	description and all the other girls
2034000	2035000	do too. So.
2036240	2037240	Is Mercy in here?
2037240	2038240	Is she?
2038240	2039520	No, Mercy's not here.
2039520	2040520	Mercy's by her lone son.
2040520	2041520	OK.
2042000	2043480	She said she would yap too much
2043480	2044480	also.
2044480	2045720	Yeah, because she's like, I'm going
2045720	2047160	to be real. I'm going to be mad
2047160	2048160	annoying.
2049840	2051320	She's probably like also geeking
2051360	2052360	out right now.
2052360	2053640	It's probably it's like yapping a
2053640	2054640	bunch.
2055960	2057200	My sweet Mercy.
2071360	2072440	I was going to pretend that rain
2072440	2073640	was like just tearing up on the
2073640	2074640	guitar.
2075640	2077640	Yeah, I'm going to do it.
2080640	2081400	Shrondi, can you play the
2081400	2082400	instruments?
2083960	2085360	No, I never learned.
2085360	2086360	I was athletic.
2087800	2090320	Oh, what kind of athletics?
2090320	2092200	And I was called
2092200	2094080	athletics and swimming as well.
2094080	2096840	And I'm I running
2096840	2098400	like athletics and the hurdle
2098400	2100000	athletics and anything that has
2100000	2101000	to do with their grippers.
2103120	2104400	I'm not being the grippers.
2104840	2106240	Someone commented on my feet.
2106240	2107480	They were like, you have very long
2107480	2108600	toes. And I'm like, sorry, you
2108600	2110360	stuffed your toes so much that
2110360	2111920	they're like fucking nubs.
2111920	2113440	But I used me.
2113720	2115560	I have regular toes.
2115880	2116960	If you didn't know, you're supposed
2116960	2118400	to be able to walk on them, not like
2118400	2120560	a little stubbly fucking way.
2120880	2121880	Like fucking toes.
2122440	2124120	And she took that personally.
2127320	2128320	Honestly.
2130160	2131880	But I'm saying my toes are long.
2131880	2132720	My toes are normal.
2132760	2133760	All together.
2137320	2139320	Harmony is the melody of the heart.
2143960	2144760	I can't stop sharing it.
2144760	2145760	Reigns boobs.
2146640	2148040	It's when she bounces, we bounce
2148040	2150640	so like lately, they're like
2150640	2151640	in and out.
2159880	2162200	Oh, my God, that's another trio.
2162240	2163240	That's so impressive.
2164160	2166040	It's so impressive.
2167080	2168240	It's got the lungs for this.
2168240	2170600	I'm I'm tired just thinking
2170600	2172240	and can say I know what I'm saying.
2172360	2173360	I mean.
2177320	2178160	Oh, don't hurt them.
2178160	2179160	No, don't hurt them.
2182840	2184240	I also have long toes.
2185560	2186560	Nothing wrong.
2187400	2189000	You can really grip it with those
2189000	2190160	long toes. Yeah.
2191160	2192160	Grip what?
2193560	2194560	It.
2197640	2199080	Group songs are much harder to mix
2199080	2200080	together, too.
2202400	2204200	I mean, I feel like it's not hard
2204200	2205480	to mix anything when it comes to
2205480	2206480	these girls because they just
2206480	2207680	naturally sound perfectly.
2207680	2208680	Oh, yeah.
2208680	2210280	They're speaking voices, they're
2210280	2211480	singing voices.
2212120	2213120	Yeah.
2215440	2216960	Stoney can clap real good.
2216960	2218280	Oh, we flint.
2221120	2222560	Grip in the grippy stick with my
2222560	2223560	grippers.
2225680	2226680	OK, no.
2234200	2235880	I want that as a tramp stamp on
2235880	2236880	my model. Thank you.
2236880	2238880	Nuzlin, the fast, fast one.
2238880	2240880	That's with my grippers.
2250160	2251160	I don't know.
2269040	2270480	I wonder what mic she uses,
2270480	2272640	Raya, because her stuff is so
2272640	2273640	clear.
2273840	2274840	I know.
2275280	2276480	Oh, thank you for the gift,
2276480	2277480	it boy.
2280840	2281840	Who that boy?
2282320	2283320	Who him is?
2283400	2284760	I'm not OK, Tyler.
2284760	2285760	Go off.
2286080	2287080	No.
2288080	2289880	I'm too pasty to see that song.
2300520	2301720	Are you enjoying it, Zara?
2301720	2303520	I just heard our giggle.
2303520	2304520	I tell you.
2311160	2312160	Oh, my God.
2312160	2313160	This is fantastic.
2316160	2317160	Imagine this in 3D.
2318160	2320160	Oh, that would be so good.
2321160	2323160	I would be pissing myself.
2323160	2324160	Same.
2326160	2327160	I didn't know how 3D concerts
2327160	2328160	work.
2329160	2330160	I didn't know you were going to
2330160	2331160	ask me for a Mariah about that.
2331160	2332160	Yeah.
2333160	2334160	He didn't say their knowledge.
2334160	2335160	Come on, lad.
2335160	2336160	Come on, Reflin's pill or bring
2336160	2337160	one, bring one, bring one, bring
2337160	2338160	one, bring one.
2338160	2339160	Come on, Reflin's pill or bring
2339160	2340160	one, bring one, bring one.
2340160	2341160	Go do the work.
2341160	2342160	Go on, Reflin's.
2342160	2343160	Go on.
2344160	2345160	There was this company that
2345160	2346160	helped Uteno Pandora
2349160	2350160	to do her 3D concert
2351160	2352160	and it's an upcoming company.
2352160	2353160	And I was like, ooh.
2354160	2355160	Oh, my God.
2355160	2356160	Inside her knowledge, too,
2356160	2358160	I met Uteno Pandora before
2358160	2360160	she debuted and before I debuted.
2361160	2362160	That's so cool.
2362160	2363160	Yeah, it's so cool.
2363160	2364160	I mean, she doesn't know that.
2364160	2366160	She doesn't know that we met
2366160	2368160	before, but I know that we met
2368160	2369160	before.
2370160	2371160	Oh, my God.
2371160	2372160	That's cool, though.
2373160	2374160	She was so nice to me.
2375160	2376160	She's so lovely, but I don't
2377160	2378160	interact with her anymore
2379160	2380160	because she doesn't know who I
2380160	2381160	am. Smile.
2382160	2383160	Smile.
2384160	2385160	She's so, so lovely.
2386160	2387160	Grin.
2387160	2388160	Yeah.
2388160	2389160	And her goal was to have a 3D
2389160	2390160	concert and she achieved it.
2391160	2392160	Oh, she achieved it.
2392160	2393160	That's so sweet.
2393160	2394160	I love girlies
2395160	2396160	in their dreams.
2396160	2397160	Achieved.
2399160	2400160	Achieved those goals.
2401160	2402160	You're only holding yourself back.
2411160	2413160	This is a good ray of bobble.
2416160	2417160	I love seeing how they move
2417160	2418160	their models.
2421160	2422160	I wonder if...
2423160	2424160	What?
2429160	2430160	It's not ogre yet, is it?
2432160	2433160	No, I'm core.
2433160	2434160	Come on, get back on the stage.
2434160	2435160	God damn.
2435160	2436160	We didn't finish it.
2437160	2438160	Oh, an idol song.
2439160	2440160	We're mollans
2440160	2441160	and aimless
2442160	2443160	in song together.
2444160	2445160	Is that a...
2445160	2446160	Is that a Zora?
2447160	2448160	Is that a Zora?
2449160	2450160	Yeah!
2451160	2452160	Are you enjoying it?
2454160	2455160	Are you having fun as Zora?
2456160	2457160	Yeah!
2472160	2474160	I didn't realise how reactive
2474160	2476160	Mimosa's ears are.
2476160	2477160	Yeah.
2477160	2478160	They are.
2478160	2479160	They're all well-read.
2480160	2481160	Mmm.
2482160	2483160	And her boobs, too.
2483160	2484160	I know, I can't stop sharing
2484160	2485160	everyone's boobs.
2488160	2490160	I have really bad eyes, though.
2490160	2492160	So sometimes Mimosa's arms
2492160	2493160	look like a part of her hair.
2493160	2494160	And she's a little nuggy.
2495160	2496160	Is she like a little nuggy?
2497160	2498160	You know what I love it.
2501160	2502160	Her arms are very thin,
2502160	2503160	so they tend to kind of
2503160	2505160	disappear into her hair, for sure.
2506160	2508160	She's our little nugget.
2509160	2510160	My little nugget.
2510160	2511160	I want chicken nuggets.
2514160	2515160	Oh my god, I had really good
2515160	2516160	chicken nuggets yesterday.
2516160	2517160	I know this is completely off-dolting,
2518160	2519160	but it's fucking delicious.
2519160	2520160	I was like,
2521160	2522160	I have bad eyes.
2523160	2524160	This is not an excuse to stare at boobs.
2525160	2526160	Let me alone.
2529160	2531160	Oh, get it, get it, get it, get it.
2531160	2532160	This is so hate.
2532160	2533160	Hate.
2555160	2556160	Yeah, Mimosa's voice.
2556160	2557160	Mimosa's voice.
2561160	2562160	Her mouth tracking is really good.
2569160	2570160	Nothing wrong with wanting
2570160	2571160	some strawberry milk.
2571160	2572160	Get out of here.
2586160	2598160	My question is,
2598160	2600160	are they doing a five-man song
2600160	2601160	at the end?
2601160	2602160	I bet.
2602160	2603160	I hope so.
2603160	2604160	I hope they do.
2604160	2605160	Yeah.
2605160	2606160	I wonder if they'll do
2606160	2607160	like an original song.
2608160	2609160	Yeah.
2609160	2610160	That would be crazy.
2611160	2613160	We should do an original song.
2613160	2614160	Yeah, why did we learn
2614160	2615160	not to do an original song?
2615160	2616160	I'm like, bro, it's stressful,
2616160	2617160	and I was trying to debut.
2617160	2618160	Last thing I'm going to do
2618160	2619160	is give them a custom song
2619160	2621160	that they like to try and do.
2621160	2623160	We should all have an original,
2623160	2624160	we should have a group song
2624160	2625160	that's an original.
2625160	2626160	Okay.
2626160	2627160	I'll do the male part of the song
2627160	2628160	because my voice can handle that.
2628160	2630160	I'll do the rap part of the song.
2633160	2635160	I'll do the backup vocals.
2636160	2638160	That leaves Azura and Mercy
2638160	2639160	and Icy.
2639160	2640160	Perfect.
2640160	2641160	We're good.
2641160	2642160	Yeah, they can carry us
2642160	2643160	through the actual vocals.
2643160	2644160	Exactly.
2645160	2646160	I'll just do that.
2646160	2647160	Yeah.
2648160	2650160	Who's Adler of everything?
2651160	2652160	I'm scared of you.
2652160	2653160	Be lower.
2659160	2660160	I'm mommy right now,
2660160	2661160	taking notes, honestly.
2661160	2663160	Bro, I'm spamming their DMs.
2663160	2664160	I'm like, how long did that
2664160	2665160	fucking take?
2665160	2666160	You're supposed to take it.
2668160	2669160	Maybe even months, honestly.
2669160	2670160	Maybe this has been
2670160	2671160	cooking since day one.
2671160	2672160	You never know.
2672160	2673160	I know I want to ask
2673160	2674160	the girls after.
2676160	2677160	I want to eat
2678160	2679160	the strawberries on her head.
2680160	2681160	I want to eat her.
2682160	2683160	Shame.
2683160	2684160	Look at the little saucy wink
2684160	2685160	she ended on.
2685160	2686160	She was like...
2688160	2689160	She knows what she's doing.
2690160	2691160	She knows it.
2691160	2692160	Not to make you guys jealous,
2692160	2693160	but...
2697160	2698160	Please.
2699160	2700160	Please, five-man song.
2701160	2702160	Come on.
2705160	2706160	Come on.
2715160	2716160	Moving on.
2717160	2718160	I know, I just got scared.
2718160	2719160	I'm like, what's happening?
2723160	2724160	I feel out.
2724160	2725160	Okay.
2733160	2734160	Oh, my God, I mean...
2737160	2738160	Really big.
2750160	2751160	I'm ready.
2751160	2753160	Oh, it's a five-man.
2755160	2756160	Let's go.
2759160	2760160	That's amazing.
2761160	2762160	What song is this?
2763160	2764160	Original?
2764160	2765160	Is this a K-pop song?
2766160	2767160	Is it K-pop?
2768160	2769160	Yeah.
2771160	2772160	What song is this?
2773160	2774160	I'm wondering...
2775160	2776160	It makes sense that they picked
2776160	2777160	a K-pop group.
2777160	2778160	Yeah, that's true.
2778160	2779160	Because they all have
2779160	2780160	girl singers with different parts.
2780160	2781160	It's a Twice song.
2781160	2782160	It is a Twice song.
2784160	2786160	I feel like I would recognize it
2786160	2787160	if it was a Twice song,
2787160	2788160	but I guess I'm a fake Twice fan.
2792160	2794160	Name this particular member's
2794160	2796160	grandmother's maiden name right now.
2805160	2806160	Oh, I'm getting tingles.
2806160	2807160	This is awesome.
2808160	2809160	Oh, my God.
2811160	2813160	Can someone tell me what song this is?
2814160	2816160	It's K-D-A, apparently.
2816160	2818160	Okay, that makes more sense.
2819160	2820160	Oh, it's K-D-A?
2821160	2822160	Yeah.
2822160	2823160	Why did somebody say it was Twice?
2823160	2824160	Why are you lying?
2825160	2827160	Oh, it's I'll Show You by K-D-A and Twice.
2827160	2828160	Okay.
2832160	2834160	Song for League of Legends.
2834160	2836160	Oh, well, that's Azura fucking Happy.
2837160	2838160	She's probably geeking out right now.
2838160	2839160	Hold on.
2839160	2840160	I want to go to her stream.
2841160	2842160	I'm going to.
2842160	2844160	She's going to be singing all the words from that one.
2846160	2848160	We'll listen to Azura singing, too.
2848160	2849160	Yeah.
2851160	2853160	She's probably harmonizing with them.
2858160	2860160	We popped up.
2865160	2866160	Oh, she's not singing.
2866160	2868160	Sing for me, Azura.
2868160	2869160	Sing.
2873160	2874160	She's just bopping.
2875160	2877160	She's bopping from her fear right now.
2878160	2880160	I'm going to say sing.
2885160	2887160	I do, like, K-D-A songs.
2893160	2895160	Wow, almost his voice.
2898160	2901160	I wish I could sing like that, my God.
2902160	2905160	I wish I could sing in Korean and in Japanese.
2909160	2910160	That sounds so good.
2910160	2912160	This is such a great song for all of them.
2917160	2920160	This must have been a lot of practice, my God.
2926160	2928160	I like how Azura is just like in the corner.
2933160	2934160	Is that chair?
2934160	2935160	I'm leaning hard.
2942160	2943160	Her voice.
2944160	2945160	I love Azura.
2949160	2950160	No, encore!
2950160	2951160	Give us more!
2951160	2953160	Mom, I want more!
2953160	2954160	I want more!
2958160	2959160	No.
2960160	2961160	It cannot be.
2961160	2962160	Encore.
2962160	2964160	Do the DJ scratch.
2964160	2966160	Be like, oh, last song.
2966160	2967160	We don't have time.
2967160	2968160	And then DJ scratch.
2968160	2970160	And they're all like, let's go!
2972160	2973160	After party.
2974160	2975160	Yeah.
2975160	2976160	After party!
2981160	2982160	On Reia's channel?
2982160	2983160	Yeah.
2983160	2984160	I'm going to go to Reia's channel right now.
2985160	2986160	Azura!
2990160	2991160	Azura!
2992160	2993160	Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit.
2993160	2994160	Wait.
2994160	2995160	Hold on.
2997160	2998160	That was really good.
2999160	3001160	Party, party, party, party, party!
3001160	3003160	That was insane.
3003160	3004160	Yeah, dang.
3004160	3005160	Let's see.
3005160	3006160	Arm.
3007160	3009160	Give me one second.
3009160	3010160	Never more.
3011160	3013160	I'm going to see if we can either watch it.
3013160	3016160	If not, I will redirect into her.
3016160	3018160	I'm going to redirect into her.
3019160	3022160	How do you redirect without ending stream?
3022160	3024160	You're not in the stream.
3024160	3025160	Yeah, you're not in the stream.
3025160	3026160	You should edit.
3026160	3027160	Edit video.
3028160	3029160	Edit video?
3029160	3030160	Yeah.
3030160	3034160	Yeah, you edit video or you just go into studio, YouTube studio.
3034160	3035160	Yeah, but how do you send them?
3035160	3040160	How do you send your viewers to the stream without ending your own stream?
3040160	3042160	Oh, I thought I didn't know what you were asking.
3042160	3043160	Oh, no, I don't know.
3043160	3044160	You can do that.
3044160	3047160	You could just post a link and be like, go forth.
3050160	3053160	In fact, I'm pulling up the link right now.
3054160	3058160	I'll post a link and then I'm going to chat with everyone for a little bit and then I'm going to redirect.
3058160	3060160	Okay, I'll do that too.
3061160	3062160	I'm going to see you guys.
3062160	3063160	Okay.
3064160	3065160	Bye.
3069160	3070160	What is it?
3070160	3071160	1115.
3071160	3072160	Oh, she's not pulled up yet.
3072160	3073160	That's why she's not live.
3074160	3075160	There you go.
3078160	3081160	I'm doing remedy for the poor post-concert crisis.
3081160	3086160	Okay, I will redirect into the waiting room for them briefings.
3086160	3088160	I'm going to say thank you to Amy.
3088160	3090160	She'd be keeping me company during this.
3090160	3091160	Absolutely.
3091160	3092160	Likewise.
3092160	3093160	Thank you.
3093160	3095160	Thank you so much.
3098160	3099160	I nailed it.
3099160	3101160	And business, business, business.
3102160	3103160	I didn't mean to spam their discord.
3103160	3105160	I was supposed to do it live once too.
3105160	3107160	Thank you so much, girls.
3107160	3108160	I'll talk to you later, all right?
3108160	3109160	Bye.
3109160	3110160	Okay.
3110160	3111160	Bye.
3111160	3112160	Bye.
3115160	3116160	All right, guys.

3117160	3118160	That was great.
3118160	3119160	My God, that was awesome.
3120160	3121160	It is such a good job.
3122160	3124160	I'm so impressed with their singing skill.
3124160	3128160	I didn't know that, like, a lot of them had pipes like that.
3129160	3132160	And for such a small company to be able to, like,
3132160	3133160	make something that amazing,
3133160	3135160	you could see why Stradi was geeking out.
3135160	3139160	She's feeling very inspired because they did such an amazing job.
3139160	3140160	And they're so talented.
3140160	3143160	You, my plus girls are so talented and they're so sweet.
3143160	3145160	I love spending time with you, my plus girls.
3145160	3146160	They're literally awesome.
3148160	3150160	But yeah, head on over to Reyes channel,
3150160	3153160	the sweet little jote, unfortunately,
3153160	3155160	right at the end.
3155160	3159160	I don't know what will consist of the after-party.
3159160	3165160	It seems like it'll be in 20 minutes.
3167160	3168160	Looks like everybody's redirecting.
3168160	3172160	Looks like Rocky from Pixeling's also redirecting.
3172160	3173160	Okay, yeah.
3173160	3175160	I think everybody's kind of redirecting into them.
3175160	3177160	So I'll see you guys later.
3178160	3181160	Make sure you go check out the watch, the after-party.
3183160	3186160	So, yeah, I'll probably be in the chat and geeking out with them.
3186160	3189160	So, bye guys. Love you.
3189160	3192160	Thank you guys for stopping by and watching this with me
3192160	3197160	and, like, hearing how goofy that me and the other girls are together.

3311160	3314160	Oh, you can almost hear me.
3314160	3317160	Oh, I'm a ghost.
3317160	3319160	It's like you can hear me.
