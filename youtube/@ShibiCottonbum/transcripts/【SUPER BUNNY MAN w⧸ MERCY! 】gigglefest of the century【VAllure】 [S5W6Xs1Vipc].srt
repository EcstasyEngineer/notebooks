1
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You

2
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You

3
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You

4
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You

5
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You

6
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You

7
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You

8
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You

9
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You

10
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You

11
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You

12
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You

13
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You

14
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You

15
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You

16
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You

17
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You

18
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You

19
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You

20
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You

21
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You

22
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You

23
00:12:50,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You

24
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You

25
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You

26
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:58,000
You

27
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
You

28
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:12,000
You

29
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:28,000
You

30
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You

31
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You

32
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You

33
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You

34
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You

35
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You

36
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You

37
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You

38
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You

39
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
You

40
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
You

41
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,080
She's a scream of horror.

42
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,920
It's fine.

43
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,200
I'm going to get the carrot.

44
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,240
I'm not going to get the carrot.

45
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,720
Should we redo this level?

46
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,800
Yeah, you want to get the carrot?

47
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,760
I think it's past the portal.

48
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,800
We're going to try to get like the carrot.

49
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,720
All right, you're in front.

50
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,920
Don't kick me in the face.

51
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,000
OK, how do we get out of here without dropping?

52
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,080
I think, hold on, let me position myself.

53
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,040
I think I can kick you across.

54
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,440
Oh, shit, OK.

55
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,200
Just a moment.

56
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,880
Hold on, I'm almost there.

57
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,480
I'm so close.

58
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,400
OK, that's not going to work.

59
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,400
I need to flip.

60
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,600
It's fine.

61
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,280
It's fine.

62
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,120
I'm getting into position.

63
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,080
Yes, get into position.

64
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:09,680
Oh, damn it, that didn't work.

65
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,440
This is how I move around.

66
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,600
Did you want to do it again?

67
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,320
It's OK, we can try again.

68
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,080
All right, what if we just launch ourselves?

69
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,560
What if we just launch ourselves?

70
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,840
I'm going to.

71
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,040
What's happening?

72
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,520
Why are you planking?

73
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,320
I thought I was going to fall.

74
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,560
All right, what if I just got a scooch?

75
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,640
Nope, nope.

76
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,360
No, sorry.

77
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,360
I'm so sorry.

78
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,760
Oh, I killed her.

79
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,760
I killed her.

80
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:51,760
I'm so sorry.

81
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,760
I hate you too.

82
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,760
Oh.

83
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,800
I'm an acrobat.

84
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,880
As you say, anything you say.

85
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,720
Yandere, queen.

86
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,400
Oh, wait, hold on.

87
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,400
Let me just.

88
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,880
It works.

89
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,480
All right, I believe in you, Marcy.

90
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,480
No, Marcy.

91
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:21,960
It's fine, it's fine.

92
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,960
Damn it.

93
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,160
Next level.

94
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,320
Sure.

95
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,720
It's only going to get harder from here, girly pop.

96
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,520
It's OK.

97
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,040
Yeah.

98
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,920
Yeah.

99
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,720
All right, it's a little gap.

100
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,640
All right, I think.

101
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,040
Oh, don't kill yourself.

102
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,880
OK, OK.

103
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,960
Can you?

104
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,400
All right.

105
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,760
How do I kick again?

106
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,000
Yeah.

107
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,360
Damn it.

108
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,360
You got to jump over that.

109
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,920
Nice.

110
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,080
You got this.

111
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,280
You got this.

112
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,040
You got this.

113
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,840
Oh, so carefully.

114
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,000
Do you remember how to grab?

115
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,600
I left a button.

116
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:08,920
Yes.

117
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,080
You got it.

118
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,960
Oh, yes, queen.

119
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,200
Flip to victory.

120
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,840
Oh, you did it.

121
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,920
Nice job.

122
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,560
Oh, my god.

123
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,480
Why does it say we didn't get the carrot?

124
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,480
It said I got the carrot.

125
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,120
Oh, I just don't count.

126
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,920
Yeah.

127
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,400
Is it behind us?

128
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:29,760
Sorry.

129
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,200
Pardon me.

130
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:30,680
Excuse me.

131
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,720
Pardon me.

132
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,760
It's not.

133
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,800
All right, it's fine.

134
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,960
Acrobatics, acrobatics, acrobatics.

135
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,920
Why am I holding on to you?

136
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,520
Because we need each other.

137
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,280
Yeah.

138
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,760
Imagine you could jump like this.

139
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,760
Let's see.

140
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,760
Mercy carry.

141
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,520
I don't think so.

142
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,560
No.

143
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,960
All right, we can also help each other over the gaps.

144
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,640
Hold on.

145
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,720
I'll be there shortly.

146
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,560
One moment.

147
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,520
If I flip.

148
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,320
There we go.

149
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,640
See, now we're a little bit longer,

150
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,560
so we can flip over the gap.

151
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,360
Oh.

152
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,840
Yeah, so you got to rotate.

153
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,600
Perfect.

154
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,000
We are speed.

155
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,520
I got you.

156
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,360
Don't worry.

157
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,800
We are speed.

158
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,480
We are.

159
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,240
Wait, where's the carrot?

160
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,080
Where's the carrot?

161
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:23,800
It's back there.

162
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,720
No, Mercy.

163
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,600
Is it level?

164
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,000
OK.

165
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,800
Mercy's like, I'm not even going to bother going

166
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,640
for the carrot.

167
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,160
What's that place?

168
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:41,560
I don't know.

169
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,200
Why don't you find out?

170
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,280
You got it?

171
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,080
Oh, hello.

172
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:46,440
Hold on.

173
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,080
I need you.

174
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:47,480
You need?

175
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,600
Oh, fuck.

176
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,680
She just took me.

177
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,760
I just got kidnapped.

178
00:19:54,760 --> 00:20:00,080
Please do not throw me to my death, sister.

179
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:00,680
Let's go.

180
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:05,880
All right.

181
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,440
I need to hold on to me because I

182
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,520
want to be able to cross this gap.

183
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,240
How do I do this?

184
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,880
It's a great question.

185
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,520
Perfect.

186
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,880
All right.

187
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,000
Wow.

188
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,720
We are a wheel.

189
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,720
We are the first wheel invented.

190
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:25,920
Oh, no, stop.

191
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,000
We were not going to make that.

192
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,560
OK, we have to jump over.

193
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,680
Mercy, you got to go first.

194
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,960
You're in front.

195
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,440
I got to be first.

196
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,120
No, yeah, you got to go.

197
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:39,640
Oh, god.

198
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,640
You got this.

199
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,640
Yes.

200
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,640
Yes, queen.

201
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,160
All right.

202
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,640
I'll be there in a moment.

203
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,600
Yeah.

204
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,120
Let's go.

205
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,920
Nice.

206
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,920
We're such gods at this.

207
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,880
Wow.

208
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,200
Oh, shit.

209
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,400
I'm actually I'm surprised at how well we're doing.

210
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,120
Oh, oh, hold on.

211
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,760
Oh, don't die.

212
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,720
Oh, nice job.

213
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,840
Impressive.

214
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,360
All right.

215
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:26,040
Oh, oh, you got this.

216
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,160
Oh, nice, nice, straight leg.

217
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,240
Save.

218
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,760
Carrot.

219
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,040
You want to get it this time here?

220
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,240
I accidentally jumped backwards, so it's all used.

221
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,120
I'll try my best.

222
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,760
Oh, no, I had seltzer water and I need to burp.

223
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,880
I'm stuck.

224
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,360
I got you.

225
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,120
Oh, yeah, you can take it.

226
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,160
I'm sorry.

227
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,960
I took the carrot, not you.

228
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,760
It's OK.

229
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,360
I just got to get it out.

230
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,440
All right.

231
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,440
Yeah.

232
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,880
I'm going backwards.

233
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,000
Oh, what's happening?

234
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,960
Oh, OK, I'm fine.

235
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,520
We're good.

236
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,760
No, mercy, please.

237
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,760
Acquired.

238
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,440
Wait, you dropped the carrot.

239
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,800
No, I didn't.

240
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,680
Oh, never mind.

241
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,320
Oh, yeah, sometimes for this game, it's like,

242
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,680
Lilly, NC is really weird.

243
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,160
Sometimes you'll fly off the screen and then come back.

244
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,480
Oh, I'm being taken with.

245
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,440
Oh, no longer.

246
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,440
Ah!

247
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,280
Oh, I'm fine.

248
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,600
It's OK, I'm good.

249
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,920
With the carrots up there, I think.

250
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,160
I know.

251
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,160
It's fine.

252
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:47,660
Hwa.

253
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,680
Yeah.

254
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,440
Wait, where is the hole?

255
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,360
Where is the hole?

256
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,600
OK, it's OK.

257
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,720
Just a flesh wound.

258
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,400
Just a little flesh wound.

259
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,120
It's fine.

260
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,800
Why is your blood like that?

261
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,800
I don't know.

262
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,240
Oh, you just, it's your good.

263
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,000
This thing, I just got your little toesies.

264
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,040
It's got a little toesies.

265
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:14,960
I'm going to hold on to you.

266
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,960
What?

267
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,960
Oh, no!

268
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,960
Oh, no!

269
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,960
You left me for dead!

270
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,960
I'm so sorry!

271
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,960
You left me for dead!

272
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,960
I killed her!

273
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,960
I killed her!

274
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,960
I killed my daddy!

275
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,960
I'm so sorry!

276
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,960
I'm horrible!

277
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Give me!

278
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Give me a kiss in here!

279
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I'm so sorry!

280
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Wait, now what?

281
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I'm just stuck!

282
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I'm impaled!

283
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Wait, move?

284
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Are you not dead?

285
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Why are you here?

286
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Why are you fucking dead?

287
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Wait, press the X button.

288
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Because it should have, it should have,

289
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
restocked it by now if you died.

290
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
All right, go back to the medial to restart this one.

291
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Let's pretend this never happened.

292
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Number seven?

293
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Yeah, I think it was number seven.

294
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
The senpais are raging.

295
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I'm so sorry, senpais.

296
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
They're okay.

297
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Okay, I scared myself.

298
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
All right, you got this, Mercy.

299
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
You can jump across, I believe in you.

300
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Oh, yeah, the tree gets in the way a little bit.

301
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
You might have to lean forward.

302
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
You might have to like tilt like this and then jump.

303
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Oh, uh, I'm in a pickle.

304
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Never mind.

305
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Avenge me!

306
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
It's fine, I'm just gonna swing.

307
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
No, Mercy, why?

308
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Why?

309
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
You're not gonna go!

310
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I wasn't about to let you die, Comrade.

311
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Thank you.

312
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
All right, okay, so it's fine, I'm just gonna...

313
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Just gonna rock with it.

314
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Pro strats.

315
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Nice.

316
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I almost got it, she's making momentum.

317
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
It doesn't matter, I'm probably gonna die on this, it's fine.

318
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Let me just edge a little closer.

319
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Oh my god, I am a master.

320
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Hold on, I'm gonna throw this carrot down to you.

321
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Okay.

322
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Where'd I fucking go?

323
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Oh, we gotta go back.

324
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Okay.

325
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
You can grab it, if you can grab it.

326
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I grabbed you!

327
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I can't do this!

328
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I'm trying to push it towards you.

329
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Okay, I got it.

330
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
No, I grabbed the ground.

331
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Okay, now I got it.

332
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Oh gosh, my cat just jumped on my desk, hold on.

333
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Boomie, please.

334
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Oh gosh, I couldn't see.

335
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
All right, lead the way.

336
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Okay.

337
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
She's doing sit-ups.

338
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Don't...

339
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
She'll be the backup for you.

340
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Maybe just a little bit.

341
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
It's okay, you got this.

342
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
You don't got this, it's fine, it's fine.

343
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I can't even kill myself properly.

344
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Oh, there we go.

345
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:04,000
All you.

346
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Oh shit.

347
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I'm clapping.

348
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
It's like it's hurting you every flip.

349
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
All right, it's fine.

350
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Oh wait, I'll backup.

351
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Nice form, amazing.

352
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I think I just started lightning outside my window.

353
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Holy crap, that was bright.

354
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Yes!

355
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
We didn't get the carrot.

356
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
But we got each other.

357
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
It wasn't about the destination, it was the journey.

358
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
What the fuck is this?

359
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Oh, it's a little bouncy thing.

360
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Can we bounce backwards?

361
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
You might have to bounce backwards on top of each other.

362
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Quick.

363
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
That's hard.

364
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I don't know if we can...

365
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Can I like, grab onto your legies?

366
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Maybe.

367
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
And then we have like, you know...

368
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Extra jump, go for it.

369
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I'm being smacked in the face by this thing.

370
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Oh, okay, well...

371
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Oh, I need your butt.

372
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I'm trying so hard.

373
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Oh wait, I got you.

374
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Oh, hello.

375
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
This is quite romantic, to be honest.

376
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I think we're both too heavy for this thing.

377
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
All right.

378
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Man, that was romantic.

379
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
That was, we just held each other and bounced around.

380
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
We could have kissed.

381
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
We really wanted.

382
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
We could.

383
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Kissed.

384
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
What did I need to do?

385
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
This bitch keeps on killing me.

386
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Wait, I didn't tweet with that.

387
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I was live.

388
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Did you tweet with that you were live?

389
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
No, I didn't.

390
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Okay, let's tweet that we're live.

391
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
There's thunder and lightning outside my house right now.

392
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Are you gonna be okay?

393
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I hope so.

394
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Okay, I can tweet that right now.

395
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Oops, been live for like 30 minutes already.

396
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
That's usually how it works for me.

397
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I casually foregoer.

398
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Live and hysterically laughing.

399
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I keep accidentally killing Mercy.

400
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Whoops.

401
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Get in here.

402
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Hold on.

403
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I'm just gonna quote, retweet yours.

404
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Alrighty.

405
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
There we go.

406
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Where's my live button?

407
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Perfect.

408
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
She be a murderer.

409
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Hello, is there a nothing to see here?

410
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Sometimes my BDSM play gets a little bit too rough.

411
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Yeah, but you know, Mercy's not, you know,

412
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
unfamiliar with a little pain.

413
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
You got this, Mercy.

414
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I'll back up.

415
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
You got this.

416
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I believe in you.

417
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I believe in you so hard.

418
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Okay, it's fine.

419
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Let me just...

420
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Romeo and Juliet impaled through my ass.

421
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I got impaled with this bike up my IF.

422
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Alright, we're doing good so far.

423
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Yeah.

424
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Oh, well, I'm fine.

425
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
You're good.

426
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I wonder if you could throw the carrot across.

427
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Oh my God.

428
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I'm so scared.

429
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
She's going to launch herself into the spikes.

430
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Hi.

431
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Mercy is durable indeed.

432
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Oh my gosh.

433
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
She is straddling that carrot.

434
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Try to grab the carrot.

435
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I'll die with you, my queen.

436
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
When the gamer and the non-gamer play games.

437
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Please.

438
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Oh God.

439
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I'm not a gamer.

440
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
What do you mean?

441
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Ask the harem.

442
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
That's the one who played.

443
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Alright.

444
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
It's my time to shine.

445
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I will try my best.

446
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Yes.

447
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
When I try my best, I mean go backwards.

448
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I mean...

449
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Never mind.

450
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
It's fine.

451
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I was going to see if I could jump back over,

452
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
but it didn't really work out.

453
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Well...

454
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Join me in the embrace of death.

455
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Together our bodies and blood intertwined.

456
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
69, baby.

457
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Wee.

458
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
You're just doing flips in the air on my screen

459
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
for no reason.

460
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Because you're not touching me.

461
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Oh, I got you.

462
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I got you.

463
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Don't move.

464
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I got you.

465
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Don't move.

466
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I will grab you.

467
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Hold on.

468
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Let me just figure this out.

469
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I saw I had it.

470
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I saw I had it.

471
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I got you.

472
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Let go.

473
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I got you.

474
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I am letting go.

475
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Oh.

476
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Perfect.

477
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Okay.

478
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I'll never let go.

479
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
What?

480
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I'm trying to avoid the thingy.

481
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
If I need to.

482
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
All right.

483
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
All right.

484
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
All right.

485
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Why did you get bit down?

486
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I don't even...

487
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I don't even know what happened there.

488
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I think we should f the carrot on this one.

489
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Wee.

490
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
If I randomly lose power,

491
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
it's because the raging thunderstorm

492
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
outside my house randomly.

493
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Oh, I'll join you.

494
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
My legs spread.

495
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Retty to accept death

496
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
in its purest form.

497
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Like how did I badly mess up?

498
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Fuck these trees.

499
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
You got it.

500
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
You got it.

501
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
All right.

502
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Careful.

503
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Perfect.

504
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Okay, we got it.

505
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
All right.

506
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Fuck that carrot.

507
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Good.

508
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Oh, I almost kicked you off.

509
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Oh my God.

510
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Oh my God.

511
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
We're fine.

512
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Okay.

513
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
We have one issue.

514
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
We do have an issue.

515
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
It's okay.

516
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I'm going to grab you.

517
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I'm going to grab you.

518
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I got you.

519
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Let go.

520
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
You got me?

521
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Yeah.

522
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I tried.

523
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
In the end, it didn't even matter.

524
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Oh my God.

525
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Mercy.

526
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Mercy.

527
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Oh, God.

528
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Actually do that.

529
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Perfect.

530
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I'm keeping you with me.

531
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Maybe I shouldn't have kept you with me.

532
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I like how we're only on like the first area.

533
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Yeah.

534
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Okay.

535
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Will we ever pass the gap of spikes?

536
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
No, but we will 69 while we die.

537
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Like how bad are we at this game?

538
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I'm pretty fucking bad.

539
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I won't admit.

540
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I don't even know how you can be good at this game though.

541
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Nice.

542
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Impressive.

543
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Okay.

544
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Okay.

545
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Oh, never mind.

546
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I tried.

547
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
That was so close.

548
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Oh, you want to hold on?

549
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Yeah.

550
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Well, I think we're stuck.

551
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I am.

552
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I am.

553
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Let go.

554
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Okay.

555
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Perfect.

556
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Okay.

557
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Are you okay?

558
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Are you fucking dead?

559
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I'm dead.

560
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Take my dead body with you.

561
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Okay.

562
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Wait, where were we supposed to go after that?

563
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
No, once one of us dies, we can't finish the level.

564
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Oh.

565
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
So the thing disappears.

566
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
What the fuck is happening?

567
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I was holding on.

568
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Okay.

569
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Perfect.

570
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
We're good.

571
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I let go.

572
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Nice.

573
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
All right.

574
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Grab my ass.

575
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Are you ready?

576
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I grabbed your ass.

577
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Yeah.

578
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Are you ready?

579
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Okay.

580
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
That was supposed to have the opposite effect.

581
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
I was hoping it would propel us forward, but it didn't.

582
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I just saw a red flash of lightning outside my window.

583
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
That was pretty cool.

584
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Red?

585
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Yep.

586
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Okay, I'm good.

587
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Those back shots, I suppose.

588
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I was going to grab you.

589
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Well, now I have to grab you.

590
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Hold on.

591
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Please.

592
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Please.

593
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Sorry, my fat ass killed you.

594
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I know I got dragon lightning outside of my house right now.

595
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Dragon deez ball.

596
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Sorry.

597
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Anyways.

598
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Oh, nice kick.

599
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Nice kick.

600
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
If only we could get over this fucking line.

601
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
What was that?

602
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Wait, I'm going to hold on and then you can kick off.

603
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Ready?

604
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Go.

605
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Go as hard as you can.

606
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Why do we go backwards when this happens?

607
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Maybe if we aim the other way.

608
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Can we blast off?

609
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
All right.

610
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Well, I'm just going to take you with me.

611
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I'll let go.

612
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Oh.

613
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Oh.

614
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Oh.

615
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Hold on just a moment.

616
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
What if I...

617
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Well, goodbye, carrot.

618
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Do a cheeky...

619
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Well, bye, me.

620
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Yeah, there's a physics glitch where if you hold on to each other's feet, you can like

621
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
propel yourself across the game.

622
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
So I was trying to do that.

623
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Will we ever get past this level?

624
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I don't know.

625
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
We're going to try.

626
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
But...

627
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I believe in us.

628
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
We'll do it.

629
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Oh, sorry.

630
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
I fucked up your jump.

631
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Let me back up.

632
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Don't worry.

633
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Whoa.

634
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Impressive landing.

635
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Impressive death even more so.

636
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Wait, it showed that you died for me.

637
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
It didn't show that you died for me.

638
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,000
I think people on my side can see that you're just glitching profusely.

639
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Oh, what the hell?

640
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Wait, you're still alive?

641
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Yeah.

642
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Oh.

643
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Nice.

644
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Oh my God, Mercy.

645
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
You're so goaded.

646
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Let's go.

647
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Baby Chibi, you should take the carrot.

648
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
You want me to take the carrot?

649
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
All right.

650
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Carrot acquired.

651
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Mercy glitched the system.

652
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Are you in front of me or behind me?

653
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I'm in front of you.

654
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Okay, I just want to make sure.

655
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Because again, sometimes the game will reflect something else.

656
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Oh, Mercy.

657
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
It's okay.

658
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Oh my God, I got a carrot.

659
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Okay.

660
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
All you got to do is make it across.

661
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
All you got to do is make it across.

662
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Immediately dies.

663
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
It's fine.

664
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
It's fine.

665
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
We got this.

666
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Yeah.

667
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
It's fine.

668
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
It's fine.

669
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
You're good.

670
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
All according to plan.

671
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
All according to plan.

672
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
All according to plan.

673
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
69 each time.

674
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Every time in death, we just die in another sex position.

675
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Very, very on character for us.

676
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
All right.

677
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Let's go.

678
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
You got it.

679
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Nice.

680
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Amazing landing.

681
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Can you back up?

682
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I don't want to actually kick you and then make you fly across to your death.

683
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
All right.

684
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
You got to angle this.

685
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Oh my fucking God.

686
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
This game is called super buddy man.

687
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Hello.

688
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I'm playing with Mercy.

689
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Mercy, you can just die.

690
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I died, Mercy.

691
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I have to like literally wiggle my way down.

692
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I know sometimes it gets increasingly hard to kill yourself in this game.

693
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
All right.

694
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
All right.

695
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Oh my God.

696
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Oh, okay.

697
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Let me go back for you.

698
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Hold on.

699
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
It's okay.

700
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Goodbye.

701
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
No, I was coming back.

702
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
I literally could have grabbed her.

703
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Size and pale self on spikes.

704
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I'm sorry.

705
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I truly am.

706
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
So sorry.

707
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
We're all in this together.

708
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Watching you slowly sit up to grab the carrot is really funny.

709
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Amazing execution.

710
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Oh, no.

711
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Oh, no.

712
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Oh.

713
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
What?

714
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
I love this game.

715
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
It's just, you just have a bunch of laughs.

716
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
It's just the funniest thing ever.

717
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,000
It's like so gentle and then immediately hold on.

718
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Can you back up?

719
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Okay.

720
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I'm good.

721
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Oh.

722
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Layed it on my face.

723
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Oh, it's fine.

724
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Amazing recovery.

725
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Yes.

726
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Yes.

727
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Yeah.

728
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
You get the carrot.

729
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
You want me to get the carrot?

730
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I'll try.

731
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
And when I say I'll try, I mean I'll almost.

732
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Okay.

733
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
All right.

734
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Carrot acquired.

735
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Carrot acquired.

736
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
You're still your hateful one.

737
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Yes.

738
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
You recovered.

739
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
What the heck?

740
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Let's fucking go.

741
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
I got the carrot.

742
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
I love you.

743
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Glitch that.

744
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
I don't know.

745
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Sometimes the game glitches.

746
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
It looks like you die, but you don't.

747
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
All right.

748
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
All right.

749
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
All we got to do, Mercy, is make it across.

750
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Oh, Mercy.

751
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Mercy.

752
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Mercy, I need your help.

753
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Mercy, I need you to grab me.

754
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Mercy.

755
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Mercy, please.

756
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Mercy.

757
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
I'm trying my best.

758
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Just a little hard to get over this.

759
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
I'm slowly sliding down.

760
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
I'm slowly sliding to my death.

761
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Please.

762
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Mercy, please.

763
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Give me a second.

764
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
I got you.

765
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Oh, thank God.

766
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I thought I was a goner.

767
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
All right.

768
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
I'll give you some space.

769
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Go on.

770
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Give me a second.

771
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Watch out for the red button.

772
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Impressive.

773
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Amazing.

774
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
She is the moment.

775
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
See what I mean by like that area is hard.

776
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Yep.

777
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
All right.

778
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
See if you can jump over the button.

779
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
The thing is just on the other side.

780
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
You might want to lean the other way.

781
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I'm going to lean the other way.

782
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Not that way.

783
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Oh, my God.

784
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
If I could just...

785
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Okay.

786
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
All right.

787
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Go to the portal.

788
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Go to the portal.

789
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Amazing.

790
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
All right.

791
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Don't die.

792
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
God, I laughed so hard.

793
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
I nearly peached my shell.

794
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I'm like, don't die.

795
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
And I just immediately fucking die.

796
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
All right.

797
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
I ruined that.

798
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
It's all right.

799
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Okay.

800
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Hold on.

801
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
I try.

802
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Let me just kill myself.

803
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Oh, hello.

804
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Oh, perfect.

805
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
That worked.

806
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Oh, I'm going the wrong way.

807
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
All right.

808
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
I fucked that carrot.

809
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
And me too, apparently.

810
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I hate that.

811
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
This is going to become a rage game if you don't get past this level.

812
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
You're standing on my body.

813
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Can I stand on your body?

814
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
What the hell?

815
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Being a rabbit in the hoppy hills.

816
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Playing games.

817
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
And shit.

818
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Doing...

819
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Yeah.

820
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Shit.

821
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Nice.

822
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
All right.

823
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
We're getting somewhere.

824
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Oh, my God.

825
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
This might be it, guys.

826
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
This might be...

827
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Oh, hello.

828
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
All right.

829
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Actually, that might be helpful.

830
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Perfect.

831
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Oh, no.

832
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Oh, nice job.

833
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Wait, shit.

834
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Okay.

835
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Fuck the carrot.

836
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
We launched into orbit.

837
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
All right.

838
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Sorry.

839
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I'm so sorry.

840
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Oh.

841
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Oh, what the hell?

842
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Oh, at least there's not spikes here.

843
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
But there's spikes over there.

844
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Am I dead?

845
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
I think you are.

846
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
How did you die?

847
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I don't know.

848
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Weird.

849
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
You, like, died off screen.

850
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
I died off screen.

851
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
I was like, where did I go?

852
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Maybe you hit the spike and we didn't see.

853
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
I don't know.

854
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Oh.

855
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
His face flooded into my ass.

856
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
It's okay.

857
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Her ass smells nice.

858
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
I did take a shower today.

859
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Amazing precision.

860
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
All right.

861
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
It's okay.

862
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
It's okay.

863
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
It's not okay.

864
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
It's okay.

865
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Almost first try.

866
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
We almost did it.

867
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
This is definitely an easier one.

868
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I feel like we can do, though.

869
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
I think I can get the carrot.

870
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Yeah.

871
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Easy peasy.

872
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Carrot acquired.

873
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,000
If I could, if I could just, can I, can I please just,

874
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,000
if I could, if I could just, please.

875
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Oh, there we go.

876
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
All right, Mercy.

877
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
I'm just going to go to the portal.

878
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
If I can get over this thing.

879
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
I'm trying my best.

880
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
I'm sorry.

881
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
I know it's hard.

882
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
I was also like struggling.

883
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
So I don't blame you at all.

884
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
It's funny.

885
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
You're doing the stuff in like slow motion on my screen.

886
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Okay.

887
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
There's something over here that should kill us.

888
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
It's a gap.

889
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Oh my God.

890
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
You got it.

891
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
I was so careful.

892
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
I was so careful.

893
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,000
I'm like, you got the, why is every, I'm never speaking.

894
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
I'm always just like, oh, we got this.

895
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
And then we just immediately die.

896
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
All right.

897
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Oh, how did I get down here?

898
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
We got each other.

899
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Just the two of us.

900
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
All right.

901
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
You probably can grab that carrot.

902
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Can I grab a carrot?

903
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000
I'm just going to be doing fucking flips on this thing.

904
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Why am I just in the air?

905
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
What is happening?

906
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Help, grab me.

907
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
I got you.

908
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Okay.

909
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Oh wait, we actually should be able just to go over like this.

910
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Yeah.

911
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
All right.

912
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
We should have done that.

913
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Oh, let go.

914
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Nice.

915
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
All right.

916
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
I got it.

917
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
I need to just scoop forward.

918
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Nice.

919
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Nice.

920
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Nice.

921
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
I see the perfect.

922
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
All right.

923
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
So there's a little gap and you just got to jump across it.

924
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
I believe in you.

925
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Maybe you should grab the carrot.

926
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
You want me to grab the carrot?

927
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
I'll grab the carrot.

928
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Wait, maybe we should hold on to each other.

929
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
I don't, I think we have to jump this.

930
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
I don't think, if we try to flip, I think we'll just kill ourselves.

931
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Oh, okay.

932
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Unless you want, we can try.

933
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
What if we both grab the carrot?

934
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
If I could just, if I could please.

935
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
It's okay.

936
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
You can jump.

937
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
I won't even let me get it.

938
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Okay.

939
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Here, I'll grab it.

940
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
You may grab it.

941
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
I got it.

942
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
I shouldn't have grabbed the carrot.

943
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
I shouldn't have grabbed it.

944
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Give me a second.

945
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I want to see if there's like a possibility of us,

946
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
of me shooting.

947
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Shooting your shot.

948
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Yeah.

949
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Across the thing.

950
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Go for it.

951
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
No.

952
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
You just have to like, you have to angle like this.

953
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
So I'll show you.

954
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
You just got to, you just got to be like this.

955
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
You got to lean forward.

956
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,000
You got to balance, but go forward and then jump like that across.

957
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Like that.

958
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Here, let me just grab you.

959
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Oh.

960
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
I let go.

961
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
All right.

962
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Or I could kick you across that gap.

963
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Give me a second.

964
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
There you go.

965
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Well, welcome back.

966
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Welcome back.

967
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Give me a second.

968
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
I'll give you a second.

969
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Or maybe more than one second.

970
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Yeah.

971
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
I almost got it.

972
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
I got the carrot.

973
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Let's make it over now.

974
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Oh.

975
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Okay.

976
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Okay.

977
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
It's fine.

978
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
It's fine.

979
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Grappy.

980
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
You might be able to grab me.

981
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Never mind.

982
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Never mind.

983
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
It's so ogre.

984
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
It's so ogre.

985
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Kick me in the face.

986
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
I can kick you in the face.

987
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
No.

988
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Give me a second.

989
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Give me a push me forward a little.

990
00:54:43,000 --> 00:55:03,000
That was just dead silence as I just flew away to my death.

991
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Let's go.

992
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
What is that?

993
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,000
That's the physics glitch.

994
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Oh, hi kitty.

995
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
You need to get out of the way kitty.

996
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
I can't see kitty.

997
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Oh my gosh.

998
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
I can't see myself.

999
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Did I fucking die?

1000
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Oh, no.

1001
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
I can't see myself either.

1002
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Oh, there I am.

1003
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Nice.

1004
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Let's go.

1005
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
I don't know what happened.

1006
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
I don't know how that happens.

1007
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
That's all up to you now.

1008
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Take your time.

1009
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
It's so ogre for me.

1010
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Take your time, Mercy.

1011
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Think it through.

1012
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Yep.

1013
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Yep.

1014
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Scooch a little bit closer.

1015
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
And then when you're at a nice 45 degree angle,

1016
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,000
you're going to want to tip in the forward direction.

1017
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
So lean forward.

1018
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Go for it.

1019
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Yeah.

1020
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
When you're at that like teetering point,

1021
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
you're about to be on your hands and knees.

1022
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Give me it.

1023
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Take your time.

1024
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
It's all right.

1025
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Just take your time.

1026
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Think, be careful.

1027
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Think it through.

1028
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
You're fine.

1029
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
You're good.

1030
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
You're good.

1031
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
You got this.

1032
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
You're amazing, Mercy.

1033
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
So amazing.

1034
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Just lean forward.

1035
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Just a tad.

1036
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Jump.

1037
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Yeah.

1038
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Mercy, let's go.

1039
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
My girl.

1040
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
That's my genome right there, everybody.

1041
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
All right.

1042
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
What's going on over here?

1043
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
It's okay.

1044
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
I just got a little bit of my toesies.

1045
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
I'm good.

1046
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Be careful.

1047
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Nice.

1048
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
I got you.

1049
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
I got you.

1050
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Come back.

1051
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Don't worry.

1052
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
I got you.

1053
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Yeah.

1054
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,000
This is like a great team building exercise game.

1055
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
We should grab each other's legs or something.

1056
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
That's a good idea.

1057
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
There you go.

1058
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
It's okay.

1059
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
We're getting somewhere.

1060
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
This is working out perfectly.

1061
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
What if I lean up?

1062
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Oh.

1063
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
This is impressive.

1064
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
I have amazing upper body strength.

1065
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Wait, see if you can flip over on my body.

1066
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Let go of me.

1067
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Oh, no, that didn't work.

1068
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
No, that didn't work.

1069
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

1070
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Actually, you might be able to use your legs to propel yourself up.

1071
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Yeah.

1072
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Use me like a springboard.

1073
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
I'll hang out just like this.

1074
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
You just kick me in the ass.

1075
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,000
I'll try to grab your leggings.

1076
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Nice.

1077
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Oh, almost got it.

1078
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Sorry.

1079
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Sorry.

1080
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
I'm trying to angle myself better.

1081
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Nice.

1082
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
All right.

1083
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
I'll figure this out.

1084
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
How do we get you?

1085
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
I am the bunny master.

1086
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Mercy, where'd you go?

1087
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
I definitely got up here.

1088
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Where'd she go?

1089
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Down.

1090
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Down.

1091
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
To my town.

1092
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,000
We're going down, down in an early area.

1093
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Yeah, to my death.

1094
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
I'm so strong.

1095
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Um.

1096
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Whoops.

1097
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
I'm fine.

1098
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Just my hands.

1099
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Oh, sorry.

1100
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
My cat's food is going off.

1101
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Oh, you're ready?

1102
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Me?

1103
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
I'm like a bunny.

1104
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
I flipped through.

1105
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Okay.

1106
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Let me just.

1107
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Yep.

1108
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Okay.

1109
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
All right.

1110
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Yeah.

1111
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
You want to lean a little bit more forward.

1112
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Perfect.

1113
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Nice.

1114
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Oh, yes.

1115
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Incredible.

1116
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
All right.

1117
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Let me let's do what we did before.

1118
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Oh, you don't even need me.

1119
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
We did it.

1120
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Oh my God.

1121
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
We're pros.

1122
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Oh.

1123
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
I'm so sorry.

1124
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
What happened?

1125
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,000
I accidentally, when I tried to jump over the gap,

1126
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
I kicked you back at the same time.

1127
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Hold on.

1128
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Let me go.

1129
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Your body is facing through the walls.

1130
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Oh, is it?

1131
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
On your end, I'm on just on top.

1132
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Let me see if I can fix it by grabbing you.

1133
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Okay.

1134
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Hello.

1135
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
I was such a pro for a second.

1136
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Oh, okay.

1137
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Oh, you can keep rolling like this.

1138
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Go forward.

1139
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Yeah.

1140
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Nice.

1141
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Wow.

1142
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
We are so good at this.

1143
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Wait.

1144
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Oh, the carrots right there.

1145
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Is it a trap?

1146
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
No, it's not.

1147
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
We're good.

1148
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,000
All right.

1149
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
I'll grab the carrot.

1150
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
If I could just.

1151
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
The carrot.

1152
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
The trap up here.

1153
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
I got it.

1154
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Oh, nice.

1155
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
All right.

1156
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
I'll let you go first.

1157
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
You got this.

1158
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Oh, definitely.

1159
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Oh.

1160
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Oh.

1161
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Yep.

1162
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Yep.

1163
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Yep.

1164
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Oh, God.

1165
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
So nervous.

1166
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Oh, God.

1167
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Oh, God.

1168
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Oh, God.

1169
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Oh, God.

1170
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Oh, God.

1171
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Oh, God.

1172
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Oh, God.

1173
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Oh, God.

1174
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Oh, God.

1175
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Oh, God.

1176
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Oh, God.

1177
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
So nervous.

1178
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:56,000
I'm so scared you're going to roll into the button.

1179
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Hold on.

1180
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Let me get back up there so you can see better.

1181
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Oh, nice job.

1182
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Nice job.

1183
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Okay.

1184
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
No.

1185
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Let me let me join you.

1186
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
All right.

1187
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Let me just.

1188
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:18,000
You have to jump over because we're going to fuck each other for over there.

1189
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Nice recovery.

1190
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Oh, God.

1191
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
I love watching mercy work.

1192
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Work out what she's going to do next.

1193
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Nice.

1194
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Oh, my gosh, mercy.

1195
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
You're incredible.

1196
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Okay.

1197
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Now I just can't fuck this up.

1198
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Okay.

1199
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
I'm good.

1200
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,000
It's okay.

1201
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
I stabbed my footsie a little bit, but it's fine.

1202
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Oh, all right.

1203
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
What?

1204
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
I grabbed it.

1205
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Oh, okay.

1206
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Oh, at least on my end I did.

1207
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:01,000
But if it if it shows up for you, you can grab it.

1208
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:06,000
You're you're in perpetual.

1209
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
I already got in.

1210
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
So the game's just glitching.

1211
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Oh, mercy.

1212
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Oh, mercy.

1213
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Please.

1214
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,000
I'm sorry.

1215
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,000
You did it.

1216
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Yay.

1217
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Wait, I did it.

1218
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
On my side.

1219
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
You did.

1220
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Yeah.

1221
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
It still says unlocked.

1222
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Really?

1223
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Oh, we need to get more.

1224
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,000
We needed to get more coins.

1225
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Okay.

1226
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Okay.

1227
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:35,000
So let's go back to the menu and then we need one more coin.

1228
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:39,000
So we should probably go get a carrot for one of them.

1229
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Number one looks like the easiest one.

1230
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Did we already grab that carrot?

1231
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
No, wait.

1232
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Did we not?

1233
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Yeah.

1234
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Hold on.

1235
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Oh, we can do the time thing really fast.

1236
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Yeah.

1237
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Oh, we weren't.

1238
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
We were already too slow.

1239
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
All right.

1240
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Yeah.

1241
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Let's try that again.

1242
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Try that again.

1243
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
The time one should be easier.

1244
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Go.

1245
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Fucking trees.

1246
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Never mind.

1247
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:15,000
We start.

1248
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Go.

1249
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Fuck.

1250
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Damn it.

1251
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
I was too slow.

1252
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Is six minutes good enough?

1253
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
No, we gotta see how there's like a ghost.

1254
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
You have to do it in five seconds.

1255
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
What?

1256
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Yep.

1257
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Go.

1258
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Oh, I fucked up.

1259
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
So you can see the little ghost bunny.

1260
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,000
It's like it's a ghost race from Mario.

1261
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Can I please get up?

1262
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:45,000
I've never done a ghost race for Mario before.

1263
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Mario Kart?

1264
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:53,000
I'm so sorry.

1265
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
I'm so slow.

1266
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,000
No, no, no.

1267
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
It's also it's like whoever's behind like the second person.

1268
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:03,000
It's hard to get the momentum because you're already at a disadvantage.

1269
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Oh my gosh.

1270
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:11,000
It's older.

1271
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Killing myself.

1272
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Farewell.

1273
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Well, just keep going.

1274
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Oh, it's a cat.

1275
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,000
I never noticed that before.

1276
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Okay.

1277
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Maybe we should do a carrot one.

1278
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Yeah.

1279
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
We didn't do four carrot.

1280
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Let's try that one.

1281
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Where's the carrot?

1282
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Was the carrot behind us or in front of us?

1283
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000
I never get.

1284
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Hold on.

1285
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
No.

1286
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
It was in front of us.

1287
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Oh yeah.

1288
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,000
There's like, yeah, there's one that.

1289
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:03,000
That was a trap.

1290
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:09,000
I could just, if I could, perfect.

1291
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Butt to butt.

1292
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
I got you.

1293
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Don't worry about it.

1294
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
We got it.

1295
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Yeah.

1296
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Where's a carrot for this one?

1297
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Oh, it's down there.

1298
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Oh, that's an easy one to grab.

1299
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Yeah.

1300
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Let me try to grab it.

1301
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Yeah, you got that.

1302
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
I'm going to go in the portal.

1303
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
All you girly pop.

1304
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Nice use of feet.

1305
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Mercy's good with her feet, everybody.

1306
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Not so much your hands.

1307
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:47,000
I think you're grabbing the floor.

1308
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Nice.

1309
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,000
You got it.

1310
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Yeah.

1311
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Yeah.

1312
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Good job.

1313
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
We did it.

1314
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Can I go menu now?

1315
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Yes.

1316
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Then you should be able to do that.

1317
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:05,000
You should be able to go the next level.

1318
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Where is it?

1319
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,000
That's a great question.

1320
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Go.

1321
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Why isn't it?

1322
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,000
We have 15.

1323
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Why isn't it automatically unlocking it?

1324
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Do we have to do it again?

1325
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Do you want to try to do 10 again and hopefully it'll prompt it?

1326
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Maybe.

1327
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Yeah, let's try it.

1328
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
I'm going to cry.

1329
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
We don't have to.

1330
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:41,000
It said 15 on the lock.

1331
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Why isn't it letting me move?

1332
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Oh, there you go.

1333
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Kick you across.

1334
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Kick you across.

1335
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Yes.

1336
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:59,000
How does somebody do this in a short amount of time?

1337
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Very smartly.

1338
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
I'll back up.

1339
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Give you some space, queen.

1340
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Yeah.

1341
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Amazing.

1342
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Flawless.

1343
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Yes.

1344
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Shit.

1345
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:25,000
You know, sometimes you just get stuck in places like me getting stuck here right now.

1346
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Oh, grab my feet.

1347
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:32,000
If you don't need the carrot, we already grabbed it before.

1348
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Grab my toesies.

1349
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Oh, god damn it.

1350
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,000
I'm trying to grab your feet, queen.

1351
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Or grab any part of me.

1352
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:49,000
You might be able to jump and grab.

1353
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Oh, shit.

1354
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Yeah.

1355
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Yeah.

1356
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Yeah.

1357
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:02,000
I can't move.

1358
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Okay.

1359
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, god.

1360
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,000
I'm going back.

1361
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
I'm going to wait my turn.

1362
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:27,000
I'll be taking this and saving it for later.

1363
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Thank you very much.

1364
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Perfect.

1365
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Just amazing.

1366
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:42,000
I'm stuck.

1367
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:51,000
I'm stuck.

1368
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Step pro, I'm stuck.

1369
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Oh, well.

1370
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling.

1371
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,000
What?

1372
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:10,000
What?

1373
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Pro, pro.

1374
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Don't ever think it, mercy.

1375
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:24,000
You got this.

1376
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Nice.

1377
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
All right.

1378
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Time to get the fuck up here again.

1379
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
I'm back up.

1380
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Nice.

1381
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Got it.

1382
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Me, not so much.

1383
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Got it.

1384
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
I made room for you.

1385
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Oh.

1386
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:47,000

Help.

1389
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:54,000
I'm just going to sit here and watch and creep.

1390
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Oh, god.

1391
01:09:55,000 --> 01:10:05,000

Nice scoot.

01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Amazing.

1395
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,000
You did it.

1396
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Nice job.

1397
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Let me not fall to my death.

1398
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Please.

1399
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
There we go.

1400
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Yeah.

1401
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Next level.

1402
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Next level.

1403
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Oh, we're in snowy place now.

1404
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Okay.

1405
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
So there's ice.

1406
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Wee.

1407
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Oh.

1408
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:48,000
This is going to be a hard one.

1409
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Wait, I'm fine.

1410
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,000
All right.

1411
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Let me just.

1412
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Damn it.

1413
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Carrots going to be hard to get.

1414
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
I'm so sorry.

1415
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Mercy, just go in here.

Kick off.

Lock in.

01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,000
She's just on her back.

1424
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Watch out for the spikes right there.

1425
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Nice job.

1426
01:11:50,000 --> 01:12:00,000
All right.

You're good.

1428
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:05,000
You're somehow still alive.

1429
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
I'm impressed.

1430
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Let me grab you.

1431
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Let me see if I can grab.

1432
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
I can do it.

1433
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000

Where's the carrot up here?

1442
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Is it up there?

1443
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
I don't know.

1444
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:37,000
I'll lean back and see and you can scope it out.

1445
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Oh, it's up there.

1446

I don't think I can why did it let me do that

1884
02:05:52,480 --> 02:05:54,960
Why was I so strong that I could just

1885
02:05:56,640 --> 02:06:01,520
Now I want to keep trying to take it. I can't

1886
02:06:14,080 --> 02:06:16,080

All right, you got your feet

1897
02:07:11,920 --> 02:07:14,960
I can't craft a thing. Okay. I got your feet now

1898
02:07:15,760 --> 02:07:17,760
Well, we can just hang out like this

1899
02:07:18,160 --> 02:07:20,080
Okay, can we flip it again? Let's see if we can

1900
02:07:21,360 --> 02:07:23,360
And

1901
02:07:23,360 --> 02:07:25,520
Okay, damn it. Let's do it that time

1902
02:07:26,320 --> 02:07:28,320
It's okay

1903
02:07:28,800 --> 02:07:30,800
Marcy

1904
02:07:32,800 --> 02:07:34,800
I got it

1905
02:07:35,360 --> 02:07:38,240
All right, and we can just flip together to this one

1906
02:07:39,440 --> 02:07:41,280
And you can hold on

1907
02:07:41,280 --> 02:07:44,080
And I'll just jockey style hold on as well

1908
02:07:45,440 --> 02:07:47,440
Oh god

1909
02:07:47,680 --> 02:07:49,680
Okay, are you serious?

1910
02:07:50,480 --> 02:07:52,480
That's fine. Are you serious?

1911
02:07:52,640 --> 02:07:54,640
Oh, it's not fine

1912
02:07:57,200 --> 02:08:00,480
Okay, I guess we got to be balanced to like

1913
02:08:02,400 --> 02:08:05,440
Like not in the middle, but I think like we both have to be holding on

1914
02:08:05,440 --> 02:08:08,240
I can't be holding on to you or you can't be holding on to me

1915
02:08:11,280 --> 02:08:13,280
I feel so cheated me too

1916
02:08:17,280 --> 02:08:23,440
It's fine. It's okay. It'll come back. It'll come back. Don't worry. It'll bounce back to us. No, it won't actually ever got

1917
02:08:23,440 --> 02:08:27,040
This is the one that does that. Um, hold on to me. Maybe it works

1918
02:08:31,040 --> 02:08:35,840
No, I forgot it goes down so it won't come back up. Yeah, that was another one that did that

1919
02:08:42,080 --> 02:08:44,080
Taking a sip of my wawa

1920
02:08:51,200 --> 02:08:53,200

All right

1970
02:12:58,980 --> 02:13:02,420
All right, this is so hard not to die on from these spikes

1971
02:13:03,220 --> 02:13:05,220

2000
02:16:46,980 --> 02:16:48,980

02:17:14,580 --> 02:17:16,580

In this game, of course

2012
02:17:39,060 --> 02:17:43,940
It's so funny because mercy said the wrong thing earlier and I corrected her and now she's doing it to me

2013
02:17:44,820 --> 02:17:46,820
