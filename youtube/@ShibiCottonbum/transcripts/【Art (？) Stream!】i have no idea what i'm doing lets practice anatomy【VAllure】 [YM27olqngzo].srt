Did you guys do something wrong?

16
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I feel like are you sucking up to me?

17
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Yeah, yeah, I don't know if I trust you.

18
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I don't know, hmm, suspicious.

19
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You might be wondering why am I holding my leash like this?

20
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm drawing with it, don't worry about it.

21
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's a skill that takes years to master, but I have done so.

22
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
How was the bed?

23
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Oh, it was so good.

24
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Such great bed.

25
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm sorry, I'm eating almonds.

26
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It was so good.

27
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I didn't think it would be different.

28
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Lying on the floor versus lying on a bed frame.

29
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
The leash has a drawing feature.

30
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It draws you closer to me, so I can choke you out.

31
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
How the almonds activated?

32
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
What does that mean?

33
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
There's blue diamond honey roasted almonds.

34
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Right on the floor of this one.

35
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It's really good handwriting. Are you lying to me?

36
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Oh, am I? Okay, great.

37
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm not actually...

38
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Thank you for the soup, ma'am.

39
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
The only thing I did wrong was staring at your fuzzangas,

40
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
and I feel no shame.

41
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
One, thank you.

42
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Two, I didn't know you could thumbs up a soup.

43
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's a meme from a cookbook? Oh, okay.

44
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Yeah, I have really stupid chicken scratch handwriting.

45
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I think it's pretty. Thank you.

46
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I think it looks... I like to think that it looks like

47
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
artsy, quirky, like manic pixie dream girl handwriting.

48
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You know, like, you know, yeah.

49
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm so happy I finished what I was doing before on time.

50
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I thought I was going to be late again.

51
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
That wouldn't be the first time.

52
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Yeah, we have an engine drill.

53
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
What's I doing before?

54
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Umm...

55
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Just stuff.

56
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I don't really know.

57
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It was just... I don't know.

58
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It took me a while to figure out, like, something...

59
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
to do.

96
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:15,040
When I was in middle school and high school or elementary school, I don't know what to call it for you, European friends, but whatever.

97
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,940
I also have some goldfishies.

98
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,140
But I wanted to go for illustration.

99
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,440
I actually wanted to be a comic book artist.

100
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,140
That was when I was really obsessed with Marvel.

101
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,240
I wasn't good.

102
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,540
Excuse me, will you draw one of your old OCs?

103
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,440
That's a good idea.

104
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:44,240
Although, I mostly had male OCs because I was a very horny teenager, so.

105
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,840
With goldfish, just the regular kind.

106
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,740
Do I have any old drawings or so?

107
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,140
Sadly, no.

108
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,940
My art is lost to the ages.

109
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:05,040
I wish there was one sketchbook that I did a lot of my art studies.

110
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,040
I had some really good nose studies, hand studies, I remember.

111
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,840
Mouth and eye studies.

112
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:22,240
And then I loved drawing like, just like figure drawing like masculine and feminine forms like draped over furniture or having stuff draped on them.

113
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,840
But I did used to draw a lot.

114
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,740
But again, I haven't drawn in such a long time.

115
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,940
Hot boy OCs make them kiss.

116
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,940
Trust me, sis.

117
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,140
I made them kiss.

118
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,940
But draw one of your hair.

119
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,540
I don't remember a lot.

120
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,140
I was also never good at like, I only drew like traditionally.

121
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,840
I'm not good at digital art.

122
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,640
I only ever drew traditionally.

123
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:58,440
I think I might have like some old deviant art full of like warrior cat OCs.

124
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,740
But I don't know.

125
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,440
I can't remember what the name of it is.

126
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,640
Could you draw a crowd?

127
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,540
Of course I could.

128
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,340
Aren't you here?

129
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,040
Aren't you all here right now?

130
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,040
Who is Legolius?

131
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,340
I mean Legolius and Danny Phantom.

132
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:24,440
But yeah, so I'm like, like Emmy and Azura have inspired me to like practice drawing more.

133
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:30,640
Cause I'm, you know, like how powerful you are when you can draw yourself as a VTuber.

134
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,040
I'm like, I could draw the craziest shit.

135
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,240
But I can't do that right now.

136
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,040
I'm not drawing crazy shit for the stream.

137
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:42,040
But like in the future, it would be cool if I could.

138
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,040
I also want to learn like color theory and stuff.

139
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,440
Cause I never colored.

140
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:53,540
I only like painted and did like pastels, like chalk pastels and wax pastels.

141
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,940
I'm trying to think what else.

142
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:02,440
I'm like looking over, cause like I have a sketchbook, but I never drew in it.

143
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,740
I bought a sketchbook like I'm going to draw again.

144
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,740
Like months ago did not draw on it.

145
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,440
She'd be drawing herself for the certified.

146
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:11,840
Yes.

147
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:16,740
Um, but I wish I really wish I kept up with that skill, especially now being a VTuber.

148
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:21,640
They always say being an artist is a useless skill.

149
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,740
That's not fucking true in VTubing.

150
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,940
It's a great skill.

151
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:30,040
My goal would be, it would be really cool to become a VTuber mama for someone.

152
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,540
Um, although I know what goes into that.

153
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,340
It's not just the art.

154
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:36,240
You also have to know how to cut it up and separate layers and do all that shit.

155
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,840
Um, but it would be cool to learn that stuff.

156
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:42,740
Um, but for now we're just going to practice our anatomy.

157
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:43,840
Um.

158
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,340
Sippy sip.

159
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,540
Um, thank you to you guys.

160
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:57,040
Um, I put a tablet on my throne like when I first started cause I did, you know, anticipate

161
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,840
wanting to do a drawing stream.

162
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:05,040
Um, but, uh, so thank you for all your support.

163
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:10,240
There's a, you guys don't understand how happy I get when you guys give me a gift

164
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,140
for my throne.

165
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,440
So my, um, I haven't gone downstairs yet to go get it.

166
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,240
Sorry, I'm putting my tablet on my desk and moving stuff out of the way.

167
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,640
Maybe I should get like a tablet stand.

168
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:28,440
Um, but like my vacuum was delivered and you guys don't know, I'm like, wow, I am

169
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,740
truly a hag.

170
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:37,640
If I'm so excited to have a vacuum, I'm like, yes, I have a bed frame.

171
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,140
Yes, I have a vacuum.

172
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,940
Now I can really suck.

173
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,140
It's just, it's, I'm so hag maxing.

174
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,640
It's, it's ridiculous.

175
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,140
Um, but cause my other one is like really cheap.

176
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:56,340
I want to go off of Amazon and it broke and my cats kick litter everywhere

177
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,740
with their little stinky little litter paws.

178
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:03,040
So I'm probably, I'm going to get a leave after stream, go downstairs to my

179
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,940
mail room and get that and dance the night away cleaning my house because

180
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,140
that's how messed up I am.

181
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,140
Okay.

182
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,240
Let me see.

183
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,040
I just want to make sure everything is.

184
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,940
Did you enjoy your pre stream almonds?

185
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,440
Hope the stream goes well.

186
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,740
Thank you for the tip of day.

187
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,940
Yeah, my almonds are very tasty.

188
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,740
Um, dancing in the mail.

189
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,740
No, shut up.

190
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,840
Shut up, dude.

191
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:46,940
Um, the postal mail room, you fucking dweeb.

192
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,740
I'm trying to put my headphones on.

193
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,040
What?

194
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:52,840
I have like a chunk of cat hair in my headphones.

195
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,940
Okay.

196
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,940
Um, I got paint tool sigh.

197
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:03,040
I also used to draw on paint tool sigh, but I don't remember how to.

198
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,640
Is there a way so that you guys can?

199
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,040
Okay.

200
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,640
You guys can see my cursor.

201
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:07,640
Cool.

202
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,440
So yeah, welcome.

203
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,240
Wow.

204
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,440
I can't hear my own music.

205
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:23,640
Good.

206
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,340
That's some good good good background.

207
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:28,840
No, no, no.

208
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,240
Don't give him attention.

209
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,540
Don't give him attention.

210
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,840
Pay attention to me.

211
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:36,640
Okay.

212
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,140
Yeah, I was like, it was too quiet.

213
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:38,840
I realized.

214
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,740
What would you listen to watch when you used to draw more?

215
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:51,040
Um, I was a little emo bitch and so I would either just watch like anime or I

216
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:59,140
would just listen to really like MSI and mine and what's it called?

217
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:06,340
Um, Hollywood on dad and be like, oh, I hate my life.

218
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,740
If only there were these people that were real.

219
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:10,340
Okay.

220
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:14,640
So I'll tell you like who my who some of my OCs were.

221
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:20,540
Um, I had a lot of soul leader OCs bus Hollywood on dad album.

222
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,040
Oh, that's hard.

223
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,240
Hold on.

224
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:26,340
I have to look up what they look like because I usually only go by album art.

225
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,040
I never remember album names.

226
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,240
Hello and then album.

227
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,340
No, not the who.

228
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,740
No, not Hollywood albums.

229
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,840
Jesus fuck.

230
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,640
Ah, swan songs.

231
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,240
Although I did like notes from the, oh wait, but American tragedy.

232
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:58,440
I haven't listened to any of like their newer stuff.

233
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,840
Because what was our newest thing?

234
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,040
I don't even, you haven't listened to a new empire or day of the dead.

235
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,040
Born here's a who.

236
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,440
No, my actually didn't listen to my chemical romance growing up.

237
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,440
I really didn't.

238
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,840
If it's anything but American tragedy, I won't cry.

239
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,040
Um, new EP's are good.

240
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,340
Okay.

241
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,440
I'm able to change your marks.

242
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,440
Oh, yay.

243
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:28,940
Good.

244
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,040
But um, yeah.

245
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:37,440
So, uh, so I had like my, let me see, I'll try to draw her.

246
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,940
So I had my OC who was a self insert.

247
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,640
I need to, I don't know how to use this tablet, but I know there's a zoom feature.

248
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,440
Is there, is that how you do it?

249
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:47,640
No.

250
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,240
Oh, fuck.

251
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,240
I'm zooming on the chat.

252
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:53,840
Okay.

253
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,740
Um, I don't know how to use paint tool side either.

254
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,240
So, uh, her name was Kiri.

255
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,240
Or Kiritan.

256
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,240
I don't, I can't remember the last name I gave her.

257
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:15,640
I'd have to like go back and look at like, oh wow, this is so pixelated because

258
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:21,740
the thing, we can't even see what you can't even see what I'm drawing.

259
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,340
Hold on.

260
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,440
Um, Jesus, fuck.

261
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,440
I don't know how to, I didn't know how to like properly capture this.

262
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:42,240
So Kiri, uh, she was my master OC.

263
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,640
Let me see how big is this?

264
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,240
That's pretty big.

265
00:19:47,940 --> 00:20:01,540
Um, and she was like typical, like Japanese school girl outfit from what I can remember.

266
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,440
Um, oh, it's just Kiri.

267
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,640
It's just Kiri and she, it's funny.

268
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:11,040
Now that I think of it, she has like scrawny's hairstyle.

269
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:16,740
Cause she had like the bangs and like the little thing.

270
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:26,340
And then, but then I always gave her, uh, she had two ponytails on top or whatever the fuck.

271
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,440
I'm not like trying hard.

272
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:32,440
And then I gave her like super long hair on the bottom.

273
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:40,240
Cause I really liked Tamari from, um, from Naruto.

274
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,340
So Kiri is Scottish.

275
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:42,840
No.

276
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,540
Um, and she was, she had pink hair.

277
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:55,240
She had pink hair and I'm trying to, to be honest, I don't think I made her tan.

278
00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:01,840
I think I just made her white cause I didn't have like, I don't think I had any tan OC's not to think about it.

279
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:10,940
Um, yeah, I don't, I don't know why and she had like blue eyes.

280
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,540
I think I can't remember that much.

281
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,840
But she was pretty chill.

282
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,940
She was kind of a whiny bitch from what I remember.

283
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,940
I just like really made her whiny and she was horny all the time.

284
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,340
Sorry, I heard my neighbor going by.

285
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,440
So that's my pause.

286
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,140
And I remember I gave her freckles.

287
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:40,940
Um, but yeah, she was, she was, she was chill.

288
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,240
She was cool.

289
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:44,940
Yeah.

290
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:49,040
Cause she was a self-insert and I couldn't, I just lived vicariously through her.

291
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:52,540
I can't even remember the outfit cause I gave her like the, you know, little bo shit.

292
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:57,040
And then she had like a, oh hello mother.

293
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:05,340
Um, I drew her in a lot of different outfits, but mostly she was in like a Japanese schoolgirl outfit.

294
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:12,940
I'll have to like look to check my email and see if, um, there's anything there.

295
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,140
How are you doing reeflings?

296
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,540
How are you doing?

297
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,740
How was time with strongy Elden Ring?

298
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,040
I need to add Elden Ring to my schedule next week.

299
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,540
Um, but yeah, she was chill.

300
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,940
I'm just literally going to lazily have her put her hands on her hips.

301
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,340
Yeah, whatever the fuck you guys get it.

302
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,740
Um, she was cool.

303
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:36,240
You know, always had to have the thigh highs.

304
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,740
Those were, you know, all the rage.

305
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,740
It looks adorable.

306
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,740
Oh yeah, she was, I loved her a lot.

307
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,240
She was like my pride and joy.

308
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:57,740
And then she had her, um, I will literally, I remember I drew like a really fucking sick picture of her with her scythe.

309
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:06,440
Cause her scythe was modeled kind of after Haydn's and she had like the three.

310
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,240
Um, I forget.

311
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,040
I think I had like an, wasn't an eyeball or like a mouth.

312
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,040
I can't remember.

313
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:16,040
Um, or like three dots.

314
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:16,740
I can't call.

315
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:21,640
And then there was my boy, my pride, my joy.

316
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,640
James Sinner, who was a little, wait, I put his bang on the wrong side.

317
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:36,640
I think every which side it was on and he was, um, yeah, it was definitely the side cause I always put his dots.

318
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:48,140
And he was, uh, little sick, nasty bro, little meme edge lord.

319
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:55,640
Uh, he was a ginger and, uh, cause I had a weird fascination with gingers at the time.

320
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,640
I don't know why.

321
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:04,140
Um, and I usually would just make like fix of him.

322
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:10,140
And then I had another OC, um, it's a reference to Johnny sins.

323
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:16,640
No, I like, I don't even know why I like named him Sin.

324
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:20,140
Cause he just like his real name was James Sinner, but he just went by sin.

325
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:22,640
And then he had his, he had three beauty marks under his eye.

326
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,640
That was like his thing.

327
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:29,640
Um, um, so ginger is a size.

328
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,640
Yeah, exactly.

329
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,640
Welcome in.

330
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,640
Welcome in.

331
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,140
Thank you.

332
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:35,640
Thank you.

333
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,640
Enjoy the emotes.

334
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,640
Um, yeah, he was a major edge lord.

335
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:45,140
Um, and then I had, uh, zero.

336
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:50,140
I can't use like an Android and I usually just like, I was in my fujoshi era.

337
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:53,140
So I literally just make sin in zero.

338
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,640
Just like fuck all the time.

339
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,640
This reminds me of solar.

340
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,140
Yeah.

341
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:03,140
Cause this is my soul eater OC soul eater.

342
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:09,640
She was my master and sin was the weapon.

343
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:13,640
Um, and then I can't remember.

344
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:17,640
I remember it was very elaborate for zeros here because he also had a fucking

345
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,640
banging and it went like that or some fuck.

346
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,640
I don't fucking know.

347
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:25,140
Um, and he was like very coup d'etre.

348
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,140
Hello.

349
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:27,640
Hello.

350
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,640
We all the character was here.

351
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,140
Oh yeah.

352
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,640
His name was zero.

353
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,640
And then you had to do that.

354
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,140
You had to do.

355
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,140
Yeah.

356
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:39,140
Also I was very like into scenes, scene culture.

357
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,640
So they all had like seen related stuff.

358
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:45,640
Um, and then there was zero.

359
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,640
My booby itching.

360
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,140
Um, and he was like very coup d'etre.

361
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,640
He like hated his life.

362
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,140
He would like whatever was like, oh gross.

363
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:04,140
Um, he also, he was albino cause you know, he had to have one OC have white hair and red eyes.

364
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,140
So that's what he was.

365
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:11,140
Um, and then there was, uh, I had some like teen Titan OC's.

366
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:16,640
So there was, um, fuck, I think how did his hair go?

367
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:17,640
Fuck.

368
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,140
Then there was Dante.

369
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:23,140
I think his hair was like swoopy.

370
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:27,140
Again, they all had fucking seen hair don't come for me.

371
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:32,640
And he was like, he could, um, shape shift just like Beast Boy cause I like Beast Boy.

372
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,140
He was cool.

373
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:38,140
And then his girlfriend was this chick named Addison.

374
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:41,640
She was just like a normie, but she was like very like preppy.

375
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,640
Yeah.

376
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,640
Raven.

377
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:53,140
Um, I'm going to laugh hysterically if like my childhood friend that I made all these OC's with like watches this sometime in the future.

378
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,640
And it was like, what the fuck?

379
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,640
Wait, I know these people cause we would role play all the time.

380
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,140
Um, and Addison was like really cute.

381
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:05,640
She was like your typical preppy girl.

382
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,640
And it's funny.

383
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,640
Oh, by the way, Dante had like, um, black hair and then like a red highlight.

384
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:17,640
Yeah, Addison, she was sweet.

385
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,140
She was cute.

386
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:22,140
She usually would have like a bow in her hair, some shit.

387
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,640
And her hair was like blonde and long.

388
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:34,140
Um, oh, I think I had, remember did Dante have a cool sword?

389
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:37,640
No, Dante usually would just shape shift into something and try to kill you.

390
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,640
Um, black hair.

391
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:43,140
Yeah, definitely.

392
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:53,140
Um, and then I also, cause you guys know I had a fixation with Hikaru and Kauru from Oran High School Host Club cause twincest is twincest.

393
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,640
Um, so I made my own characters named Romeo and Julian.

394
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,640
And they were toys.

395
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:12,640
And they were just, you know, pretty much a copy of Hikaru and Kauru.

396
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,640
Um, I can't remember what their hair was.

397
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,640
I think like one had like hair going up and then one had a hair going up this way.

398
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,640
I don't fucking know.

399
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,640
Let's just pretend.

400
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:29,140
Um, and then, um, I'm trying to think of my other female characters cause they had more.

401
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,640
It wasn't just Addison.

402
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,640
Oh my God, what the fuck was her name?

403
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,640
There was one other girl that I used to draw all the time besides Kiri and Addison.

404
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:43,640
Uh, Julian and Romeo.

405
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,640
And then I don't know why Addison is in zero, but you know.

406
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:57,640
Um, and then a nameless girl that I can't remember, but she was there too.

407
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,640
She was like my evil OC.

408
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:07,640
I can't, I think she had like, maybe I didn't, she was tan cause I think she had like a fro or like really big hair at least.

409
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,640
Oh, let me give her some eyelashes.

410
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:13,640
But yeah, so I had, I had a lot.

411
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,640
I had more than this.

412
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,640
I just literally can't remember them.

413
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,640
I probably had like 17.

414
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,640
Mika Boshi, what?

415
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,640
Can you blame her for being in zero?

416
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,640
Um, but yeah, I'm just, I'm just, I'm literally just scribbling.

417
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,640
Um, but yeah, that was a little insight into my twisted mind.

418
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:45,640
But I would totally, and when I was, um, before I, uh, became my PL,

419
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,640
I was actually debating to name myself Kiri.

420
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,640
Um, I was Kiri light something.

421
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:57,640
I don't know, Kiri, cause it was like cut, cause Kiri means cut.

422
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,640
I don't know if I did like something like terrible, like cut self.

423
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,640
Um, which one dated Clary on the witch boy?

424
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,640
Oh, hold on.

425
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,640
Let me draw you her.

426
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,640
That was missy.

427
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:14,640
So I also, I might, I'll try to hunt it down.

428
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,640
I don't know if I have it.

429
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,640
I did not hunt.

430
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,640
I don't, I didn't really like Sonic that much.

431
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:24,640
I liked young justice, teen Titans, uh, Naruto.

432
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,640
Soul leader.

433
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,640
I'm trying to think of what other things I like made self insert OCs for.

434
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,640
Oh yeah.

435
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,640
But like usually I would just stick Kiri in like multiple scenarios.

436
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,640
I saying this out loud makes me sound so fucking crazy.

437
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:49,640
Oh, but yeah, I liked, I don't like the new young justice.

438
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,640
I didn't watch that.

439
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,640
I like the first and like the second season and I'm like, I'm good.

440
00:30:53,640 --> 00:31:02,640
Um, but so my OC for, um, that for young justice, I have to remember what she looks like.

441
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:11,640
Her name was missy chief and she went by miss.

442
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,640
That's fucking clever.

443
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,640
I am.

444
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,640
Wow.

445
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,640
You're mentioning coldly.

446
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,640
Oko just activated me like a fucking sleeper agent.

447
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,640
Um, she again, I also, I just really like ponytail is just like scrawny.

448
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:38,640
So she had, um, she was very much modeled after jinx from teen Titans.

449
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:43,640
Um, I almost gave her the same powers, but, uh, she had like,

450
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:47,640
I think like big giant fucking huge pony tails.

451
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,640
If I can recall.

452
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,640
Welcome.

453
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,640
Welcome to being a member.

454
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,640
Um, but it sounds very British.

455
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,640
I wish I'm missy chief.

456
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,640
Yeah.

457
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,640
She was just a total, uh, what's it called?

458
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:10,640
What is it called when they just like wear a lot of bronzer jinx from Hickman.

459
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,640
No, jinx from teen Titans.

460
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,640
Um, and then again, you had to have the baying.

461
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:20,640
You always had to have the baying, you know, the baying was a necessary, necessary thing.

462
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,640
Um, but I remember, I can't really remember what her outfit was.

463
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,640
Uh, I think like it was definitely.

464
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,640
Whoa, what the fuck is up with that?

465
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:38,640
Um, she definitely, I think I gave her like some really short shorts.

466
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:47,640
And she had naturally had like striped thigh highs and then I think I gave her like, it was like a crop top.

467
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,640
And then she had like finger gloves or whatever.

468
00:32:52,640 --> 00:33:01,640
I'm just going to, um, I'm just going to, yeah, she's going to have little Barbie hands right now.

469
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,640
Um, and then she had a little striped fingerless gloves.

470
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,640
Oh shit.

471
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,640
I don't know how to use this thing yet.

472
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,640
And then she had like high boots or whatever the fuck.

473
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,640
Let me wait.

474
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,640
It's too big.

475
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,640
It's too big.

476
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,640
I won't fit.

477
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,640
Um, yeah.

478
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,640
Damn.

479
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,640
She's starting to look like fucking Ashley.

480
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:31,640
Um, but yeah, so she was cool.

481
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:42,640
She could shape shift, but when she shape shift, she could take on the powers met momentarily of the people.

482
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,640
I don't know why I'm making her look so devious.

483
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,640
So I guess what can you expect?

484
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:51,640
Um, she would take on the powers of the person.

485
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,640
I think she had like touch them.

486
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,640
I don't know.

487
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,640
It was like rogue shit.

488
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,640
I don't know.

489
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,640
But yeah, that was her.

490
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,640
And I can't remember.

491
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,640
Did she have a tail?

492
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:08,640
No, I can't remember if I gave her like cat ears and a tail just to have an excuse to draw a girl like to make anything a cat girl.

493
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,640
I would.

494
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,640
This is drawing actually represented proportions.

495
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:16,640
Now in hindsight, I realize I made a lot of my girls like very pet on or pet in.

496
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,640
I don't know how to pronounce it.

497
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,640
Don't come for me.

498
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,640
But like come for me.

499
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,640
But like don't.

500
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,640
Um, so.

501
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,640
But yeah, so I like that.

502
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,640
I made them like really short.

503
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:30,640
Because again, like what I drew was a lot in like fantasy.

504
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:34,640
So I'm tall and I have a big to boobies.

505
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:40,640
So I sometimes would make girls that would like carry definitely like looked like me minus like pink hair.

506
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,640
I might have given her tan skin.

507
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,640
I think I did.

508
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,640
And then like love her.

509
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,640
And then like blue eyes and shit.

510
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:54,640
And then all the other characters I would make usually were like white or and then like short.

511
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:55,640
I can't.

512
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,640
I think I may carry like five three.

513
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,640
I don't even remember.

514
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,640
But just me drew cute funny girls.

515
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,640
No, I didn't really know what cute and funny was back then.

516
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,640
Um, but yeah.

517
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,640
So.

518
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,640
But yeah.

519
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,640
So like that was that's a little bit of insight.

520
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,640
And to my drawing history.

521
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,640
Again, as you can see, I scribble.

522
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,640
I'm not good.

523
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:20,640
If I kind of really wish I had that sketchbook because then I would show you and you guys would be like what the fuck happened.

524
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,640
And I'd be like, yeah.

525
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,640
Coming for.

526
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:28,640
Honestly, I was like super tempted.

527
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:34,640
Because when I was cast as she be, I was debating whether or not like as a sketchbook.

528
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:49,640
Because when I was cast as she be, I was debating whether or not like as a like little inside joke with myself to make some of my like genderbend my OCs and make them people that work in wonderland that you can like interact with.

529
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,640
But then you guys said you wanted to be like the people who work there.

530
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,640
So I'm like, okay, that's fine.

531
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,640
But I think I just it would be really cool.

532
00:35:55,640 --> 00:36:04,640
Maybe at some point in the distant distant future, a little visual novel where you like go to work for wonderland.

533
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:09,640
That would be actually and then like you can run into Mike genderbend OCs or something.

534
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,640
Something something visiting guests.

535
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,640
Yes.

536
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,640
It should be to the curious.

537
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,640
Oh my God, I literally have to that's going to bother me.

538
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,640
I can't remember her fucking last name.

539
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,640
We're real though.

540
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,640
Um, okay.

541
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:31,640
So if most of your OCs are flat, that's your chance to redesign them, right?

542
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,640
But it's like I like flat.

543
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:39,640
I like medium is pretty but like I like all sizes to be not of them like really thinking about it.

544
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:42,640
I used to like hate small boobs.

545
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,640
But I've I think because it's becoming a Vtuber.

546
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:54,640
I've appreciated small booba, you know, I think it's I think they're like, and then like seeing it on like real life girls.

547
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,640
I'm like, wow, like that really suits your figure.

548
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,640
I'm not I swear.

549
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,640
I'm not like skeezily checking out women.

550
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:13,640
But I'm just like, usually, again, because I used to draw a lot, I would look at someone and I would be like, wow, like I would love to draw you because of the way that your body flows or your facial structure.

551
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:19,640
Small or large, they all carry ups and drinks.

552
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,640
You appreciate them knowing they don't cause much back pain.

553
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,640
Yes, exactly.

554
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:32,640
And like, I think like if I didn't have arthritis, I don't like because I have arthritis in my neck and in my shoulders.

555
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:37,640
I feel like if I didn't have it, I would be okay with my size.

556
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:44,640
But because like, it just like, extraneously puts more pressure on that, it makes me in more pain.

557
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,640
I would I would like eat.

558
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:52,640
But yeah, you can skeezily check me out.

559
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,640
I'm skeezily checking you all out right now.

560
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:59,640
Wow, you look really nice.

561
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,640
Let me draw you like one of my harlots.

562
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:06,640
If only I could hold them for you.

563
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,640
I wish you would.

564
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:13,640
I wish you I wish I could have like a hair member at all times just like be my bra.

565
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:20,640
Because even when you wear a bra, they still it still puts pressure on your shoulders because your shoulders are supporting it.

566
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:26,640
So it's like when if someone were to like lift it up, you just I feel so like I'm doing that right now.

567
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:31,640
I'm holding up my booba and minus the weight in my hands.

568
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,640
I feel so weightless right now.

569
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:41,640
I'm like, I'm absentmindedly sticking out my chest because my posture is corrected.

570
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,640
Yeah, there's like, there's good browsers, bad bras.

571
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:48,640
Like it's whatever your bra, your foot still your waiter.

572
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:52,640
Yes, I also need you guys to make my bed for me.

573
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,640
Thank you.

574
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,640
Like Aphrodite in record.

575
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,640
Yes, exactly.

576
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,640
Someone sent me a picture of that.

577
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:04,640
And I'm like, I remember I watched that scene and I was like, oh my God, I need that.

578
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,640
Like Piccolo taking the training weeks.

579
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,640
Yeah, or like Rock Lee.

580
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:17,640
But yeah, no, but like if I didn't have to, I like if anything like a reduction.

581
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:23,640
So I'd be like, like a nice like a medium is premium, you know, how much do you pay per hour?

582
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,640
I pay you in whippings.

583
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,640
Piccolo isn't all the time.

584
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,640
Make your bed, but it won't make mine.

585
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,640
If you don't make your own bed, how can I trust you to make mine?

586
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,640
Because then your bed making skills are probably shit.

587
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,640
How many whips per hour?

588
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,640
It depends on the hour.

589
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,640
Depends on the mood I'm feeling.

590
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,640
Like two whips an hour.

591
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,640
Maybe like three.

592
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:53,640
I like things that are odd numbers because OCD.

593
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:59,640
Um, but okay, so guys, give me a pose.

594
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,640
I will look up a reference.

595
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,640
And no, I can't draw that.

596
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:16,640
Jack, what does that mean?

597
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,640
Let me talk to the hair union rep and I'll get back to you.

598
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,640
No, I'm not Jojo posing the guys.

599
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,640
You're not helpful.

600
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,640
What's the jackal?

601
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,640
Okay, I need to look this up.

602
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,640
Jack.

603
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,640
Oh, pose.

604
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:46,640
Oh, I was wondering what the name of that was because I wanted to get art of me with that pose.

605
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,640
Wait, what?

606
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,640
What characters is from?

607
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:56,640
A in the lobster?

608
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,640
Oh, guilty gear.

609
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:07,640
I never played guilty gear, but I love the character designs in guilty gear.

610
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,640
I'm actually like really fucking feeling.

611
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:12,640
I kind of want to try to see if I can do that right now.

612
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,640
I bet I can.

613
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,640
I bet I can do that.

614
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,640
I bet I'm going to try it.

615
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,640
I mean, I get up and try it.

616
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,640
You don't look at me like that.

617
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,640
This out of the way.

618
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:37,640
Because sometimes it's like good to like really do the pose reference yourself so you can get into that headspace.

619
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:41,640
So like if I just, okay.

620
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,640
Oh yeah, this is easy with the fuck.

621
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,640
Oh, oh.

622
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,640
I can jiggle my ass too.

623
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,640
Perfect.

624
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,640
Oh fuck.

625
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,640
Oh my koochie.

626
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,640
Okay.

627
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:04,640
Let me fix my pillow so I can sit down properly.

628
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,640
She got the body.

629
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,640
I got the body, otty, otty, otty.

630
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:24,640
You know, when I went to my rheumatologist, they had to do an x-ray on my neck to check out how my arthritis was.

631
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:29,640
And they were like, wow, for your age, you're more flexible than most.

632
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,640
And I'm like, what's that mean?

633
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,640
And then they're like, oh yeah, by the way, your arthritis got worse.

634
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,640
It's in your other side of the neck.

635
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,640
And your neck, it doesn't have a natural curve.

636
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,640
It's straighter than it should be.

637
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,640
And I'm like, excuse me.

638
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,640
So get that checked out.

639
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,640
Your neck doesn't curve properly.

640
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,640
You usually can get arthritis as I crack my neck into the mic.

641
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,640
For your age, I'm 56.

642
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:52,640
Exactly.

643
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,640
I'm pretty flexible for 56.

644
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,640
You guys don't believe me that I'm 56.

645
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,640
I'm so sorry.

646
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,640
Okay.

647
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,640
Let me see.

648
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:12,640
I need to pull up.

649
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,640
I don't think I'm going to be able to draw this, actually.

650
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:18,640
I can do it, but I can't think I can draw it.

651
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:23,640
Let me make this smaller.

652
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,640
You sound 56.

653
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,640
Fuck you.

654
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,640
56 years young.

655
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,640
Yeah, don't forget it.

656
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,640
Okay.

657
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:36,640
So I usually, so I also usually draw on my iPad.

658
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:40,640
I don't, I use procreate, which is the dumbest name for an app ever.

659
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:44,640
I usually use procreate when I do doodle.

660
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:48,640
But I definitely want to try drawing on this tablet.

661
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,640
It's a, I've only ever used Wacom tablets,

662
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,640
but this is a Huon Huon.

663
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:54,640
I don't know how to pronounce it.

664
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,640
You guys know I can never pronounce anything.

665
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,640
56.

666
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:00,640
Yeah.

667
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,640
I'm 56 million dollars in debt to the casino of Las Vegas.

668
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,640
Procreate is really good.

669
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:06,640
Yeah.

670
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,640
Procreate's amazing to be honest with you.

671
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,640
So yeah, I usually sketch in red first.

672
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:15,640
Wait, I want to make sure you guys can see what I'm drawing.

673
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,640
Perfect.

674
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,640
I'm looking at a reference and it's covering my OBS.

675
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:31,640
So they have like their shoulders like so in their neck.

676
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,640
You can't really see.

677
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:38,640
And then you kind of push up their butt and their hips are like right here.

678
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:44,640
And you got like boom knee, boom knee.

679
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,640
This looks so crazy foot.

680
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,640
Wait, I can't see where her other leg is.

681
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,640
Yeah, let's go.

682
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:02,640
Fabulous.

683
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,640
Okay.

684
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:08,640
And then she has her arms like on the ground.

685
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,640
You can figure out what that is, right?

686
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,640
Like I don't, I don't know.

687
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,640
Clip Studio Master Race.

688
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,640
I don't have Clip Studio.

689
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:26,640
Why don't you buy Clip Studio for me?

690
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:31,640
I also don't think I'm going to spend money on Clip Studio when I can barely draw.

691
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,640
I don't know.

692
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,640
And then usually, how do I do another layer?

693
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:47,640
Okay.

694
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,640
Those line work layers, what the fuck?

695
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,640
Can I change the opacity?

696
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:55,640
How do I, oh.

697
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:58,640
Then I kind of like lighten that shit up a little bit.

698
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,640
Again, I'm no professional.

699
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:07,640
Then I'll usually go in with blue to get like the form.

700
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:18,640
Sorry, I'm looking at her circle and then I kind of connect everything.

701
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,640
Kind of already fucked this up, but it's fine.

702
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:33,640
I make big boobies pancake on the ground.

703
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:36,640
I can't do that.

704
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,640
I can't draw hands.

705
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,640
If you could draw hands, you're a witch.

706
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:44,640
All right.

707
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:48,640
So just saying.

708
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:53,640
I usually do just like little, little mitts.

709
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:59,640
Little oven mitts.

710
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:10,640
All right.

711
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,640
Perfect.

712
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,640
Yes.

713
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:19,640
And then they got their, she has a long ass torso.

714
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,640
I do just want to say that.

715
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:22,640
Holy fuck.

716
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,640
This looks terrifying.

717
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:32,640
Her back kind of, I kind of need to put the shoulders like.

718
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,640
Kind of lasso to the list of you.

719
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,640
Oh no, it's fine.

720
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,640
I don't really care if I cut off the fingies.

721
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:46,640
A little closer.

722
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,640
Fabulous.

723
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:49,640
Wow.

724
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:58,640
You know, that's what this is what we do here.

725
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:02,640
We just, we really just want to let you have those horror vibes.

726
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,640
I don't know how people draw this pose because that's like.

727
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,640
Like hello.

728
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:12,640
Like this.

729
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:18,640
No, no, no, no.

730
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:19,640
Okay.

731
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,640
I'm getting ahead of myself.

732
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:36,640
Yeah.

733
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,640
That looks a little bit better.

734
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:42,640
It's like, it doesn't really look like it's sloping in though.

735
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,640
It's like the back isn't as sloped as it should be.

736
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:47,640
I'm literally looking at a jackal pose.

737
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:50,640
Like I'm looking at that as a reference right now.

738
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:51,640
Why is there?

739
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:57,640
I made the mistake of looking at Thanos jackal pose.

740
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:01,640
Oh man.

741
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:03,640
Oh man.

742
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:10,640
Yeah, it's I made the arch two bit because like in.

743
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:16,640
In that game and in Guilty Gear, like whatever this is from.

744
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,640
Um, they have a way longer torso proportion.

745
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:22,640
My cat is like using the litter box proportionately.

746
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:27,640
So let me actually kind of not go by their proportions.

747
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:30,640
I might go by Thanos's proportions.

748
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:35,640
Let me just look at that and real fast.

749
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:41,640
Because Thanos is like this and then.

750
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:44,640
Yeah, thank you Thanos.

751
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,640
Oh, Thanos, you're so helpful.

752
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:47,640
Thank you.

753
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,640
Yeah, it's as good as it's going to get.

754
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:02,640
Wow.

755
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:05,640
This kind of looks like a horse.

756
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:08,640
And then foot.

757
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:10,640
And then foot.

758
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:22,640
Perfect.

759
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,640
I think that came out good.

760
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,640
I think that came out pretty nice.

761
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:33,640
I'm gonna.

762
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:36,640
I'm gonna.

763
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:37,640
Can I hold on?

764
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:41,640
How do I delete a layer?

765
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,640
Can I just delete a layer?

766
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:46,640
Okay, I guess I can't.

767
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:47,640
Oh wait, there's a trash.

768
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:49,640
Okay.

769
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:52,640
And then I'm going to move this guy over here.

770
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,640
We'll start on our next pose.

771
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:00,640
So this is pretty good.

772
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,640
We got the jackal pose.

773
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:03,640
I'll put the jackal pose off to the side.

774
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,640
You can see it's head poking out.

775
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,640
The cami stretch from Street Fighter.

776
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:11,640
Okay, hold on, let me look that up.

777
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,640
Okay, I think I know which one.

778
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:16,640
I just need to see it.

779
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,640
It's when she's lifting up her leg.

780
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:27,640
Oh no, it's not.

781
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,640
What the fuck is this pose?

782
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,640
I thought it was one.

783
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,640
There's like, there's like one.

784
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:44,640
I like how the jackal pose still shows up

785
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,640
because they compare it to the cami stretch.

786
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:50,640
Damn, what the fuck is this stretch?

787
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,640
Okay, I have to do it myself.

788
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:53,640
Hold on.

789
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:56,640
Damn, her back is like a table.

790
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,640
Damn, how the fuck does she do that?

791
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:04,640
This feels nice.

792
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:05,640
Hold on, let me crack my back.

793
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:12,640
Ooh, did you hear that?

794
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,640
Oh, sorry, it's my back.

795
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:24,640
Oh, sorry, it's my old bones.

796
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,640
My old, old bones.

797
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,640
That was my hip, don't tell anybody.

798
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:42,640
I still have the Thanos pose open.

799
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:48,640
Cami street fighter pose.

800
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,640
Oh my god, that's so fucking small.

801
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:03,640
Okay.

802
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,640
Why is it so small?

803
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:06,640
I can't see this.

804
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:08,640
Okay, that's big enough.

805
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:11,640
Cool, okay, I need an almond.

806
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:15,640
Time for the hip back complete.

807
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:19,640
Is that maybe your gelf?

808
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:20,640
Yeah.

809
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,640
I'm not a milf, I'm a kill.

810
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:30,640
My eyesight has been folding since I've been born.

811
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,640
You prefer cokers good?

812
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:41,640
Okay, so.

813
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:45,640
Do this on a new layer.

814
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,640
So, see, this isn't that bad.

815
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,640
This one, oh, I'm not on pencil.

816
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:51,640
This one.

817
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,640
I can't see where I'm drawing because I need a third screen.

818
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:06,640
So, you got the head, oh fuck, you got the head.

819
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:07,640
That's so big.

820
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:10,640
Head.

821
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:13,640
I need to like back up a little bit.

822
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:14,640
There we go.

823
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:25,640
All you see is like the jackal pose in the corner.

824
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:31,640
Please hold on for money.

825
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:36,640
We love, yeah, you better love hags in this house.

826
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:40,640
Madam, see these money, bro, I'm broke.

827
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:41,640
Don't even.

828
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,640
I got so much debt to pay off.

829
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:49,640
Because of my own medical bills from being elderly.

830
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:51,640
And then fees medical bills.

831
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:56,640
I hate the American healthcare system.

832
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:00,640
I need another drink.

833
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:05,640
Can one of you guys get me a seltzer water for my fridge?

834
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:07,640
Okay.

835
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,640
So, she's kind of like looking up.

836
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:15,640
And then her...

837
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:17,640
Hold on, I cannot see that.

838
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:28,640
Damn, her shoulders are like fucking dislocated.

839
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:33,640
I'm like realizing how little range and motion I have

840
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:35,640
because of my fucking...

841
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,640
I need to go to a chiropractor.

842
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:44,640
I just hurt my shoulder.

843
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:45,640
Okay.

844
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:49,640
And then she kind of, her neck's like there.

845
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:51,640
I'm gonna draw some big old boobies.

846
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:57,640
That actually will help me though.

847
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:59,640
Now that I think about it.

848
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:02,640
Because if her chest is like this...

849
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:04,640
Yeah, Reina.

850
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:07,640
Reina, what?

851
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:09,640
Reina, please.

852
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,640
Reina, are you spitting facts?

853
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:14,640
Okay.

854
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:20,640
And then her shoulders are like up here.

855
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:22,640
And then...

856
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,640
I can't tell where her elbows are.

857
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:28,640
I think they're like near her ears.

858
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:30,640
And then hand...

859
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:31,640
Wait.

860
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:32,640
Yeah.

861
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:33,640
Hand.

862
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:35,640
Hand.

863
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,640
And then you just travel through...

864
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:44,640
Reina!

865
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:47,640
Are you good?

866
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:50,640
Ma'am.

867
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:54,640
Reina, come here.

868
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:56,640
Who are you talking to?

869
00:56:58,640 --> 00:56:59,640
Is it the demon again?

870
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:01,640
I'm alone.

871
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:02,640
They're trying to chill.

872
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:07,640
Yeah.

873
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:11,640
Come on.

874
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:15,640
Reina.

875
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:16,640
Okay.

876
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:17,640
She's sorry.

877
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,640
She's gonna keep talking to the demons.

878
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:22,640
Reina!

879
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:23,640
She's cat coming senile?

880
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:24,640
No.

881
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:25,640
She's already...

882
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:26,640
She is 14.

883
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:30,640
But...

884
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,640
What the fuck am I doing with these hips?

885
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:38,640
Okay, her legs are spread.

886
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:39,640
That sounds funny.

887
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:47,640
You gotta get the ill thigh gap in there, you know?

888
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:51,640
Whoa.

889
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:57,640
Exactly.

890
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:58,640
Reina.

891
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:01,640
Oh.

892
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:03,640
You brought me something?

893
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:06,640
Yeah, thank you.

894
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:09,640
Hi, Reina.

895
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:14,640
Wake up.

896
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:16,640
You just wanna hang out?

897
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:19,640
Yeah.

898
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:23,640
Yeah.

899
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:26,640
Are you...

900
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:28,640
Are you spitting facts?

901
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:33,640
She brought the seltzer water.

902
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:34,640
She did.

903
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:35,640
She did.

904
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:36,640
She brought me the seltzer water.

905
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:39,640
Reina.

906
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:42,640
Hi.

907
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:47,640
She's very helpful.

908
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,640
Reina, do you wanna say hi to my chat?

909
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:52,640
She's just rubbing against the microphone.

910
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:53,640
Can you say hi?

911
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:56,640
Can you...

912
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:57,640
No, can you say hi?

913
00:58:58,640 --> 00:58:59,640
Reina.

914
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:02,640
Can you say hi?

915
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,640
She's just rubbing against the microphone.

916
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:09,640
Reina.

917
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:12,640
Hey, lady.

918
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:15,640
What are you doing?

919
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,640
She is looking my arm.

920
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:21,640
Okay.

921
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:23,640
Her name is spelt rain than an A.

922
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:29,640
I'm not in the mood for taking a...

923
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:31,640
She doesn't wanna talk to you guys.

924
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:33,640
She'll purr for you, but she won't...

925
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:35,640
Oh, she's on my shoulder now.

926
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:36,640
All right.

927
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:38,640
Do you wanna purr for chat?

928
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:41,640
Can purr for chat?

929
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:48,640
I don't know if you guys can hear that.

930
00:59:58,640 --> 00:59:59,640
Oh, my God.

931
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:00,640
I need to brush you.

932
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:01,640
Jesus, fuck.

933
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:07,640
You were shedding so much.

934
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:09,640
Reina is a queen.

935
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:15,640
So it actually fits that the Spanish spelling of her name means queen.

936
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:17,640
Reina.

937
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:18,640
Reina.

938
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:21,640
She's the queen of the house.

939
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:25,640
I need to brush.

940
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:29,640
She's 14 years old.

941
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:32,640
Bumi and Fia are both one year.

942
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:35,640
They just turned one year in March and April.

943
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:37,640
Respectively.

944
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:40,640
Come brush me, save Reina.

945
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:43,640
Reina is named after...

946
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,640
I used to really love America's Next Top Model,

947
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:47,640
and there was a model named Reina,

948
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:50,640
and she was so pretty and had really pretty blue eyes.

949
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:55,640
So I named Reina after her.

950
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:59,640
And then it just worked.

951
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:03,640
You could probably Google it.

952
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:05,640
Bunny drawing Pony.

953
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:06,640
What?

954
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:11,640
Reina like from Fire Emblem like Vietnam.

955
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:13,640
Fia is from Elden Ring.

956
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:17,640
Bumi is from...

957
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:21,640
Avatar The Last Airbender.

958
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:23,640
And then Soleil was also...

959
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:26,640
Because I wanted like a theme for like the elements.

960
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:28,640
Soleil like Soleil.

961
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:29,640
She passed away years ago,

962
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:31,640
but Soleil was like Fire.

963
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:33,640
Reina is like Water.

964
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:34,640
Bumi's Earth.

965
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:37,640
And then I couldn't think of anything for air.

966
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:39,640
So Fia was just Fia.

967
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:45,640
I say senile as a possibility for a cat at 14.

968
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:47,640
No, she's actually pretty all there.

969
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:51,640
So cats will do this thing where when they have a toy,

970
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:54,640
they like to announce to people they caught something.

971
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:55,640
Because they think you don't eat,

972
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:58,640
and so she was calling everybody to come get food.

973
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:00,640
This is essentially what she was doing.

974
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:01,640
Fia is light.

975
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:06,640
Fia, technically Fia's full name is Fiala.

976
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:10,640
Because I think in like Czech,

977
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:12,640
Fiala means violet,

978
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:16,640
and Fia's skin like around her ears is purple and not pink.

979
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:19,640
Actual Warrior Cats fan.

980
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:20,640
Yes, that's me.

981
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:25,640
But yeah, Reina likes to bring stuff to me,

982
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:27,640
and I'll usually have like my toys,

983
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:30,640
her favorite toys are in my bed because she'll bring them to me.

984
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:35,640
I got her cat stairs in anticipation of my new bed frame.

985
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:37,640
She likes to take the cat stairs,

986
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:41,640
and the cat stairs also has a bed inside,

987
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:43,640
and Fia likes to sleep in there.

988
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:44,640
I'll take a picture after stream,

989
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:46,640
because I bet she's in there right now.

990
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:49,640
And Reina is like desperately hugging me.

991
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:50,640
What's up?

992
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:51,640
You just want to be snuggled?

993
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:53,640
I was snuggling with you all morning.

994
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:58,640
I'm really craving like spicy chicken.

995
01:02:58,640 --> 01:02:59,640
Oh fuck.

996
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:01,640
Oh my god.

997
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:03,640
Okay, I'm going to brush you while I talk to chat.

998
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:04,640
How about that?

999
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:07,640
Because you are shit.

1000
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:08,640
You still brush me.

1001
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:09,640
Oh no!

1002
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:11,640
I brought my bed.

1003
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:15,640
She's still purring in my arms.

1004
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:19,640
Over here.

1005
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:23,640
Purr is harder.

1006
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:25,640
Yeah, big mama.

1007
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:27,640
I know you like the brushes.

1008
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:31,640
Spicy chicken from where?

1009
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:32,640
I don't know.

1010
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:35,640
I just don't like really crispy spicy chicken right now.

1011
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:49,640
Sorry, I'm just focusing brushing my cat.

1012
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:52,640
She's like shedding so much,

1013
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:53,640
because it's so much.

1014
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:54,640
Although Simon's cats don't really shed,

1015
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:56,640
but like Reina sheds a lot.

1016
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,640
She's always shed a lot for some reason.

1017
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,640
Other cats don't shed that much.

1018
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:05,640
I'm drawing while I was drawing

1019
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:07,640
the campy street fighter stretch.

1020
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:13,640
Just like me getting strung by she for real for real.

1021
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:17,640
Now she's trying to escape me.

1022
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:19,640
Where are you going?

1023
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:23,640
Where are you going, miss ma'am?

1024
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:26,640
Oh my gosh, there's so much cat here on this brush.

1025
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:28,640
Yeah, just hang out.

1026
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:35,640
I can't wait to use the vacuum later,

1027
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:37,640
because you're covering cat hair,

1028
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:39,640
and it's everywhere.

1029
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:42,640
I self-insert as Reina.

1030
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:44,640
Yeah, I'm just brushing you.

1031
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:46,640
I don't know if you can even hear the brushing noises.

1032
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:53,640
Oh my gosh.

1033
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:57,640
I have one of those blood brushes

1034
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:59,640
you can click in a little like...

1035
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,640
What's it called?

1036
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,640
Show all the hair that you got.

1037
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:06,640
I'll take a picture of the hair that just came off Reina,

1038
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:08,640
and you guys will be like, what the hell?

1039
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:11,640
And mind you, I brush her very often.

1040
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:14,640
She just sheds a lot, because I think she's older.

1041
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:17,640
You're going bald, old woman.

1042
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:19,640
No, I'm kidding. She doesn't even look like she's old.

1043
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:23,640
She's 14, but she looks like she's a 5-year-old cat.

1044
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:28,640
Yeah, let me get some booty cheeks.

1045
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:31,640
She's not even fluffy.

1046
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:33,640
They're short-haired cats.

1047
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:35,640
I've never owned a long-haired cat.

1048
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:39,640
Oh yeah, you liking it, huh, mami?

1049
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:43,640
Wholesome cat brushing.

1050
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:46,640
56.

1051
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,640
I think in cat ears, Reina is actually like 72.

1052
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:55,640
But she's still spry.

1053
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:57,640
The other cats, she keeps up with them.

1054
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:11,640
Some great ASMR.

1055
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:15,640
Young bald woman.

1056
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,640
I'm so sorry.

1057
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:21,640
She's not even bald. She's like very...

1058
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:24,640
She's like, she looks perfectly normal.

1059
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:26,640
She was seeing pictures of her in my alt account.

1060
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:33,640
You'll see that she just looks like a normal cat.

1061
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:36,640
But she's like signies.

1062
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:39,640
I can't wait to sneeze later.

1063
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:42,640
Yay.

1064
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:47,640
It came for the arts.

1065
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:49,640
It came for the brushing ASMR.

1066
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:54,640
It's not my fault that my stream got derailed by my lovely old cat

1067
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:57,640
who just wants to be brushed.

1068
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:00,640
She's enjoying herself and she's looking up at me with love in her eyes.

1069
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:04,640
Reina will actually usually be on my lap.

1070
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:06,640
Reina will actually usually be on my lap during a lot of streams

1071
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:09,640
because she is my soul kitty.

1072
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:12,640
So she just likes to be near me at all times.

1073
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:15,640
And also when she knows that I'm stressed out from playing a game

1074
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:18,640
she'll come and see me.

1075
01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:21,640
Okay, I'm going to take a picture of these giant pieces of fuzz

1076
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:24,640
that just came off of Reina and I'll show you guys.

1077
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:30,640
Oh fuck, I need to plug my phone in. It's almost dead.

1078
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:36,640
I need a dry can of the picture.

1079
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:46,640
And then I'll take a picture of her on my lap.

1080
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:49,640
She's just chilling.

1081
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:52,640
Ew.

1082
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:04,640
And it's funny because I wear a lot of black

1083
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:07,640
and so it's just usually Reina's hair on me.

1084
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:10,640
Okay, Reina, I'm going to put you down now, okay?

1085
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:13,640
He's like, no, mother.

1086
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:16,640
Please, mother, no.

1087
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:18,640
You've forsaken me.

1088
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:21,640
Does he know about the alt?

1089
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,640
I don't think he knows about the alt, boys.

1090
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,640
Reina looks like it just killed her family

1091
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:33,640
because they put her on the floor.

1092
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:36,640
Reina, why do you have that look on your face?

1093
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:40,640
I just totally threw you to the wolves.

1094
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:44,640
Throw me to the wolves and I'll come back pregnant.

1095
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:49,640
No, I didn't mean to start recording the video.

1096
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:56,640
I wish someone would treat me like she treats her cats.

1097
01:08:57,640 --> 01:08:58,640
Yes, I love my kitties.

1098
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:00,640
I treat my cats with the utmost care.

1099
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:03,640
Here in my world.

1100
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:08,640
Okay, Reina, you need to move.

1101
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:11,640
She's like, let me sit exactly where your chair goes.

1102
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:15,640
I still need to get a shelter.

1103
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:18,640
Because Reina left it on the floor.

1104
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:22,640
Reina, can you pass me that seltzer water that you brought me?

1105
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:25,640
She slipped her tail.

1106
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:27,640
Okay, fine, I'll get it myself.

1107
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:45,640
There's cat hair all over my tablet.

1108
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:47,640
I'll get it myself.

1109
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:56,640
Some spicy seltzer water.

1110
01:09:57,640 --> 01:09:59,640
I usually call it seltzer water, spicy water.

1111
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:03,640
Anyways, let's get back on track, sorry.

1112
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:08,640
And then she got some...

1113
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:12,640
Wait, I'm always terrible with proportions for legs.

1114
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:17,640
So it's like that.

1115
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:19,640
Koochie.

1116
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:21,640
Koochie.

1117
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:23,640
Five butt fang.

1118
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:37,640
This kind of looks like horse legs, but don't worry about it.

1119
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:42,640
She has such wide fucking hips.

1120
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:47,640
I didn't make her boobs bigger just for the proportions.

1121
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:51,640
Just so at least people will think this is fetish art.

1122
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:55,640
So it makes at least a little bit of sense.

1123
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:57,640
Perfect.

1124
01:10:57,640 --> 01:10:58,640
Okay.

1125
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:05,640
Lovely.

1126
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:08,640
Fabulous.

1127
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:12,640
And then, you know, intertwine the fingers.

1128
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:18,640
Now we're getting somewhere.

1129
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:19,640
The quads go hard.

1130
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:22,640
Okay, so I'll make another layer and I'll put this in blue.

1131
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:25,640
So it's like you can get rid of all that gross sketch.

1132
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:32,640
So she's like kind of looking up.

1133
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:34,640
Might need a darker blue.

1134
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:37,640
So she's kind of looking...

1135
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:38,640
Oh my God.

1136
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:40,640
Looking up.

1137
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:47,640
She's like, you know, perfect booby.

1138
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:51,640
You get a better stabilizer booby.

1139
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:01,640
This looks, you know, pretty good.

1140
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:03,640
You get the free armpit.

1141
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:11,640
I think the first thing I need to do is work on proportions.

1142
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:16,640
Elbow.

1143
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:18,640
Perfect.

1144
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:23,640
Hey man, this looks pretty fabulous.

1145
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:25,640
If I don't mind.

1146
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:31,640
And then you gotta get that gorgeous waistline.

1147
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:36,640
So she's got, yeah, she's got some crazy quads.

1148
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:41,640
I don't know why I gave her a fucking bulge.

1149
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:43,640
She got the ill thigh gap.

1150
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:45,640
She got some butt fangs.

1151
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:49,640
I don't know why I gave her a fucking bulge.

1152
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:51,640
She got the ill thigh gap.

1153
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:53,640
She got some butt fangs.

1154
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:55,640
I don't know why I gave her a fucking bulge.

1155
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:08,640
Who needs knees with thighs like these?

1156
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:12,640
Watermelon don't stand a chance.

1157
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:20,640
But, well, get some definition.

1158
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:22,640
No, I don't like that.

1159
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:25,640
Okay.

1160
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:30,640
And then see it's put her calf over there.

1161
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:33,640
Yeah.

1162
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:36,640
She's too.

1163
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:46,640
You gotta get those oven mitt hands in.

1164
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:53,640
That, you know, that's pretty good.

1165
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:55,640
To be honest with you.

1166
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:03,640
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty bomb.

1167
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:05,640
You know, your belly button.

1168
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:11,640
Behind the jack of all.

1169
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:14,640
Okay, hold on.

1170
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:15,640
Let me delete this.

1171
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:17,640
Look at that.

1172
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:19,640
Gorgeous outline.

1173
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:22,640
This.

1174
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:28,640
Let me shrink her.

1175
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:31,640
Fuck.

1176
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:33,640
Fuck.

1177
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:34,640
Fuck.

1178
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:36,640
I don't know how to use this.

1179
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:37,640
Fuck.

1180
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:38,640
Still not.

1181
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:39,640
I spread her legs too much.

1182
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:42,640
I don't know how to use this.

1183
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:43,640
Fuck.

1184
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:44,640
Fuck.

1185
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:48,640
No, I don't want to cut.

1186
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:49,640
I just want.

1187
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:51,640
Okay.

1188
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:52,640
Deselect.

1189
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:56,640
Just use the lasso tool because God fucking damn.

1190
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,640
I just want to move this.

1191
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:08,640
Oh, wait, it's because it's on a different layer.

1192
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:11,640
Whoopsies.

1193
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:13,640
I don't.

1194
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:15,640
I guess I'll just stick her over here.

1195
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:20,640
Oh, you guys can't see what I'm doing.

1196
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:23,640
Why?

1197
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:26,640
All right, we'll move over there.

1198
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:28,640
All right.

1199
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:29,640
What's another.

1200
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:32,640
I did stick her behind the other one.

1201
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:33,640
I don't want point.

1202
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:35,640
I don't know if you guys saw it, but maybe it's a good thing.

1203
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:36,640
Drop.

1204
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:37,640
I can't draw that.

1205
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:40,640
Sometimes that's true.

1206
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:42,640
So that's come out as you should.

1207
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:45,640
Now.

1208
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:49,640
Playing with a boil ball now.

1209
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:55,640
Any JoJo pose, a stick figure.

1210
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:57,640
See, I could do a stick figure.

1211
01:15:57,640 --> 01:15:59,640
No more.

1212
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:01,640
What's a momo cute pose?

1213
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:06,640
It's funny when I don't know what pose that is when I've done the thingy.

1214
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:08,640
Okay.

1215
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:17,640
Oh, it's just the fucking heart.

1216
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:18,640
Okay.

1217
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:19,640
Yes, I do know that.

1218
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:21,640
Perfect.

1219
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:22,640
Okay, we'll do that.

1220
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:25,640
Stick figure with big Buzzingas.

1221
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:32,640
Big Buzzingas only.

1222
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:36,640
Okay, so she's really cute.

1223
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:38,640
Okay.

1224
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:43,640
Let's do a new layer.

1225
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:51,640
She so she know you have her.

1226
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:53,640
Her head.

1227
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:54,640
Oh, hello.

1228
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:56,640
Oh, it's because it's fucking still selected.

1229
01:16:57,640 --> 01:16:58,640
You have her head.

1230
01:16:58,640 --> 01:16:59,640
Okay.

1231
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:07,640
And she's kind of like, oh,

1232
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:10,640
I love you.

1233
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:12,640
The heart.

1234
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:18,640
I'm going to make her looking straight on.

1235
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:21,640
And.

1236
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:24,640
She's got.

1237
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:31,640
Sometimes I get lost in my own BGM.

1238
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:33,640
So no.

1239
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:36,640
Massive, but don't go home.

1240
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,640
And she's kind of just.

1241
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:45,640
You are not.

1242
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:48,640
Oh, no.

1243
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:50,640
No.

1244
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:52,640
No.

1245
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:54,640
No.

1246
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:56,640
No.

1247
01:17:57,640 --> 01:17:58,640
Wait.

1248
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:00,640
Proportions.

1249
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:01,640
Hello.

1250
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:03,640
Arm proportions.

1251
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:05,640
They don't exist here.

1252
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,640
What the fuck am I doing?

1253
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:10,640
Okay, we're going to fuck that up.

1254
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:15,640
Okay, let's just do like the heart here.

1255
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:19,640
Those are the hands.

1256
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:21,640
There we go.

1257
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:22,640
That's better.

1258
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:29,640
And yeah, she's kind of just hanging out standing.

1259
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:31,640
So I guess I'll just make her stand.

1260
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:34,640
Cute.

1261
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:35,640
Adorable.

1262
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:37,640
I kind of made her arms too short, but it's fine.

1263
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:39,640
The bowling.

1264
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:44,640
She's got.

1265
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:45,640
She's doing the heart.

1266
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:47,640
She's.

1267
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:55,640
Listen, I don't know why I love to draw like very exaggerated hourglass figures.

1268
01:18:57,640 --> 01:18:58,640
So like.

1269
01:18:58,640 --> 01:18:59,640
Leave me alone.

1270
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:02,640
Like.

1271
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:04,640
So like.

1272
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:05,640
Leave me alone.

1273
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:08,640
Like.

1274
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:18,640
I'll make this leg in front.

1275
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:22,640
So we have, you know, a little bit more depth.

1276
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:24,640
This leg will be behind.

1277
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:26,640
And we got to make her a cat girl.

1278
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:28,640
Or actually, this looks like a puppy girl.

1279
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:30,640
So we're going to make her a puppy girl.

1280
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:34,640
She's kind of looking flat.

1281
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:36,640
I haven't gotten to that part yet.

1282
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:38,640
Leave me alone.

1283
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:40,640
Okay.

1284
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:41,640
Let's make a new layer.

1285
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:51,640
Gotta grab blue.

1286
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:56,640
I'm trying very hard.

1287
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:57,640
Okay.

1288
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:02,640
I'm so focused on making sure my anatomy is perfect even to the detriment of my art.

1289
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:04,640
I just don't care right now.

1290
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:10,640
If you haven't noticed, this isn't a serious drawing stream.

1291
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:14,640
And probably all of them I'd ever do will not be serious.

1292
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:24,640
I definitely made her shoulders way too fucking narrow.

1293
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:29,640
It's fine.

1294
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:33,640
Drawing on the wrong fucking layer, Shibi.

1295
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:37,640
Don't worry about it.

1296
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:39,640
She's just a petite gal.

1297
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:41,640
You know?

1298
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:46,640
I just really want to straw boobs right now.

1299
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:48,640
Okay.

1300
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:54,640
I did it.

1301
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:56,640
I did it.

1302
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:09,640
Gotta make her cute puppy ears.

1303
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:12,640
You know?

1304
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:16,640
We'll give her some really fabu hair, you know?

1305
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:31,640
Kind of looks like a poodle.

1306
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:33,640
I'm kind of living for it.

1307
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:53,640
One of my personal pet peeves is when a character is a kemenomumimimi that I can't pronounce,

1308
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:55,640
but they have human fucking ears.

1309
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:58,640
It bothers the fuck out of me.

1310
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:00,640
I used to tease one of my friends.

1311
01:22:00,640 --> 01:22:02,640
I don't know if she's still in the chat, Toto,

1312
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:05,640
because she is a tiger and she has tiger ears,

1313
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:07,640
but then she has human ears.

1314
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:09,640
And then she messaged me this morning

1315
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:11,640
and she's just like, guess what?

1316
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:12,640
I'm like, what?

1317
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:13,640
She's like,

1318
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:16,640
Reora Panthera from Hololive has double ears

1319
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:19,640
and I literally almost threw my phone across the room.

1320
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:23,640
Because she has cat ears and she has human ears.

1321
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:24,640
Why do you need more?

1322
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:25,640
Why do you need four ears?

1323
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:27,640
You don't need four ears.

1324
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:28,640
It bothered me so bad.

1325
01:22:28,640 --> 01:22:30,640
Like, and really, you prefer double ears?

1326
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:32,640
What is wrong with you?

1327
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:35,640
Are they just vestigial organs then?

1328
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:37,640
Like, which are the ones that you use?

1329
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:41,640
Is better for canonically fake ears and a headband?

1330
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:42,640
Then that's fine.

1331
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:44,640
She does.

1332
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:45,640
She does have double ears.

1333
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:46,640
Yeah, Fuuamoko has double ears.

1334
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:48,640
Wait, Fuuamoko has double ears?

1335
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:49,640
Hold on.

1336
01:22:55,640 --> 01:22:56,640
You're lying to me.

1337
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:00,640
You have got to be lying to me.

1338
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:02,640
No, they, no, they don't.

1339
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:03,640
No, they don't.

1340
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:05,640
Wait.

1341
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:07,640
Fuuamoko?

1342
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:11,640
No, they don't.

1343
01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:15,640
They don't have double ears.

1344
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:20,640
What the fuck?

1345
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:24,640
How could you lie to me like that?

1346
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:33,640
Well, I just look at so much shit.

1347
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:34,640
They do not.

1348
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:38,640
I just look at so much art.

1349
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:40,640
Their ears are not there.

1350
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:43,640
In looking at their models, their ears are not there.

1351
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:49,640
Serenity has...

1352
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:52,640
Serenity has double ears?

1353
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:56,640
So, I'll spoil something for you.

1354
01:23:57,640 --> 01:23:59,640
In my trailer,

1355
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:03,640
I had double ears and I was like,

1356
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:05,640
get those fucking ears out of here.

1357
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:07,640
I hate it.

1358
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:10,640
Because I used to have human ears and I was like,

1359
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:14,640
no, get those fucking ears out.

1360
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:16,640
I hate double ears.

1361
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:19,640
Just cover them with hair where the ears would normally be.

1362
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:23,640
I hate it.

1363
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:25,640
So, like, it's literally one of my pet peeves.

1364
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:26,640
It bothers me.

1365
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:27,640
It turns me off.

1366
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:34,640
How the fuck am I going to draw this other arm?

1367
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:41,640
How the fuck am I going to draw this other arm?

1368
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:46,640
So, I'm seething right now.

1369
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:49,640
I can't believe Mokoko and Fulawa have fucking double ears.

1370
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:51,640
I'm literally so upset.

1371
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:55,640
Butt fangs.

1372
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:57,640
I love me some butt fangs.

1373
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:02,640
When I was doing shit with my model and I took off my skirt,

1374
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:04,640
I was like, yo!

1375
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:06,640
Because I didn't think I had those.

1376
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:09,640
No, I don't hate them.

1377
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:12,640
I'm just, I'm just, I'm not, I'm just disappointed.

1378
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:13,640
I don't hate them.

1379
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:14,640
I'm disappointed.

1380
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:15,640
Okay?

1381
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:20,640
You know what?

1382
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:22,640
She's going to be cupping her booby in this one.

1383
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:31,640
I'm going to do the little puppy girl, puppy girl tail.

1384
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:33,640
Gotta get the puppy girl tail in.

1385
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:39,640
Um...

1386
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:42,640
I don't know how to draw hands, so...

1387
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:44,640
We're going to do...

1388
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:46,640
What the fuck is this thing?

1389
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:52,640
We're going to do the little, we're going to do Lego mitts.

1390
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:00,640
What was that?

1391
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:02,640
Okay.

1392
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:07,640
You know what?

1393
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:09,640
We're just going to stay with how we did this before.

1394
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:12,640
Abulous.

1395
01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:17,640
And then I'll get the other fingers kind of in there.

1396
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:19,640
Is there a hand on backwards?

1397
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:21,640
Oh!

1398
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:23,640
Okay, I see what I did.

1399
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:26,640
Technically, this is her pinky and then this should be like shaded.

1400
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:30,640
Cause the thumbs are on the inside.

1401
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:37,640
Don't worry about it.

1402
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:39,640
Her hand's a little bit broken.

1403
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:40,640
Is she's naked?

1404
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:42,640
Um...

1405
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:44,640
Perhaps.

1406
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:46,640
Perhaps.

1407
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:50,640
No, she's not.

1408
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:52,640
She's just wearing a crop top.

1409
01:26:53,640 --> 01:26:54,640
Okay.

1410
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:57,640
And it's really short shorts.

1411
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:01,640
She's very cute.

1412
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:03,640
Whoa.

1413
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:06,640
Very cute with some thickum thighs.

1414
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:28,640
I'm like just trying to...

1415
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:32,640
Like make or click her leg back.

1416
01:27:32,640 --> 01:27:33,640
How about we just do this?

1417
01:27:33,640 --> 01:27:34,640
Yeah, that's fine.

1418
01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:40,640
I've never done an art stream.

1419
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:42,640
What the fuck do people do in art streams?

1420
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:45,640
Wow, fabulous.

1421
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:47,640
Oh, we love to see it.

1422
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:48,640
We're not drawing feet.

1423
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:50,640
You guys don't get that for free.

1424
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:55,640
He has legs for days.

1425
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:01,640
Yeah, no feet for you.

1426
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:02,640
You get a little paws.

1427
01:28:02,640 --> 01:28:04,640
I'll give you some furry feet.

1428
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:16,640
You can get some furry feet.

1429
01:28:17,640 --> 01:28:21,640
Bro, no feet dropped.

1430
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:28,640
Gorgeous.

1431
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:30,640
Am I right or am I right?

1432
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:35,640
Okay, let's put her off to the side.

1433
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:41,640
And now we're gonna try to draw something.

1434
01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:44,640
I'm gonna stick you guys on top of each other.

1435
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:50,640
What should we try to draw?

1436
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:55,640
Give me an animal and then a theme.

1437
01:28:56,640 --> 01:29:04,640
Like cat, gyaru, dog, goff, crocodile, dundee.

1438
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:06,640
You know what I mean?

1439
01:29:07,640 --> 01:29:09,640
Why can't I erase?

1440
01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:11,640
Why is it still racing?

1441
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:16,640
What is happening?

1442
01:29:16,640 --> 01:29:17,640
I can't erase this.

1443
01:29:18,640 --> 01:29:19,640
But I can delete it.

1444
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:20,640
Okay, that's fine.

1445
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:28,640
Bear, e-girl, hotel, travaga, dinosaur, cheerleader, goth ma.

1446
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:29,640
Ooh, I like goth ma.

1447
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:31,640
Slime, bimbo.

1448
01:29:35,640 --> 01:29:36,640
It's not him.

1449
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:37,640
It's his cuttlefish.

1450
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:39,640
That actually kind of rhymes with it.

1451
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:40,640
I think about it.

1452
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:44,640
Brab, gyaru, secret agent, platypus.

1453
01:29:45,640 --> 01:29:47,640
It's Barry the platypus.

1454
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:51,640
E-girl Barry the platypus, no.

1455
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:53,640
Dear Raver.

1456
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:57,640
I have to go.

1457
01:29:57,640 --> 01:30:00,640
I think I'm gonna go with slime, bimbo, because that sounds fun.

1458
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:08,640
Because, you know, I need to get my slime girl fix at some point.

1459
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:09,640
Goth mad scientist.

1460
01:30:09,640 --> 01:30:14,640
That's just, that's just Nova from before Mariah.

1461
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:21,640
Hold on.

1462
01:30:21,640 --> 01:30:22,640
Let it cook.

1463
01:30:22,640 --> 01:30:23,640
Let it cook.

1464
01:30:26,640 --> 01:30:27,640
What is this fucking?

1465
01:30:27,640 --> 01:30:28,640
Oh.

1466
01:30:39,640 --> 01:30:40,640
Yeah.

1467
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:46,640
Noice.

1468
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:50,640
Anyways.

1469
01:30:51,640 --> 01:30:54,640
Let's make that brush a little bit smaller.

1470
01:30:54,640 --> 01:30:56,640
Slime girl's kind of...

1471
01:30:57,640 --> 01:30:58,640
Slime girl's spit.

1472
01:30:58,640 --> 01:30:59,640
Well, she made a spit.

1473
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:01,640
Oh, I have to find the art that I made of her.

1474
01:31:01,640 --> 01:31:03,640
I think it's on my iPad.

1475
01:31:03,640 --> 01:31:05,640
Yeah, it's on my iPad.

1476
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:09,640
I know I posted it on my PL at some point in the evening.

1477
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:12,640
I'll make a slime girl made out of blood.

1478
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:14,640
She's made out of period blood.

1479
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:24,640
Her name was saliva.

1480
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:30,640
She went by live.

1481
01:31:31,640 --> 01:31:34,640
Her last name is Hawk Tua.

1482
01:31:35,640 --> 01:31:36,640
Live Hawk Tua.

1483
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:45,640
Okay.

1484
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:47,640
Actually, I'm going to do a new canvas because...

1485
01:31:50,640 --> 01:31:51,640
Is there a possibility?

1486
01:31:51,640 --> 01:31:53,640
I don't know how this shit works.

1487
01:31:54,640 --> 01:31:55,640
This is a wrench do.

1488
01:31:57,640 --> 01:31:58,640
Okay.

1489
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:00,640
Can I do...

1490
01:32:01,640 --> 01:32:02,640
3000?

1491
01:32:10,640 --> 01:32:11,640
Cool.

1492
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:14,640
Okay, that looks a little bit better.

1493
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:18,640
Get real close, impersonal.

1494
01:32:19,640 --> 01:32:20,640
Wow.

1495
01:32:20,640 --> 01:32:23,640
I never done an Australian accent before, but I just did it.

1496
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:24,640
Impressive.

1497
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:27,640
Live Hawk Tua, my new...

1498
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:28,640
Oh, gee.

1499
01:32:29,640 --> 01:32:30,640
That's one of my...

1500
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:32,640
That's my slime girl.

1501
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:33,640
All three goes live.

1502
01:32:33,640 --> 01:32:34,640
Live Hawk Tua.

1503
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:41,640
Shabee is cooking and almost burned the kitchen.

1504
01:32:41,640 --> 01:32:43,640
I was burned the kitchen, not the food.

1505
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:44,640
The kitchen.

1506
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:46,640
Better than Anita's.

1507
01:32:47,640 --> 01:32:48,640
Okay.

1508
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:52,640
I'll sketch in light blue.

1509
01:32:55,640 --> 01:32:56,640
Just to really get this...

1510
01:32:56,640 --> 01:32:58,640
Oh, that's fucking neon.

1511
01:32:58,640 --> 01:32:59,640
Never mind.

1512
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:00,640
I can't see that.

1513
01:33:03,640 --> 01:33:04,640
Let's go back to red.

1514
01:33:07,640 --> 01:33:08,640
Okay, I need...

1515
01:33:09,640 --> 01:33:11,640
I'm not used to...

1516
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:15,640
Whoa.

1517
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:20,640
Dude on three.

1518
01:33:20,640 --> 01:33:21,640
Okay, I think that's better.

1519
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:24,640
So...

1520
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:29,640
We're making a slime girl.

1521
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:31,640
Oh, see.

1522
01:33:31,640 --> 01:33:32,640
She's a bimbo.

1523
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:33,640
Let me get closer.

1524
01:33:34,640 --> 01:33:36,640
Real close and personal.

1525
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:37,640
Am I right?

1526
01:33:40,640 --> 01:33:41,640
I can't draw eyes.

1527
01:33:41,640 --> 01:33:42,640
Or faces.

1528
01:33:42,640 --> 01:33:44,640
Or anything for that matter.

1529
01:33:47,640 --> 01:33:49,640
Live Hawk Tua is the background character in a show

1530
01:33:49,640 --> 01:33:50,640
where we come some sense with.

1531
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:51,640
Live being the jack of...

1532
01:33:51,640 --> 01:33:52,640
No!

1533
01:33:52,640 --> 01:33:54,640
I'm not drawing a jack of pose.

1534
01:33:54,640 --> 01:33:57,640
I'm literally just going to draw a fucking T-pose or some shit.

1535
01:33:58,640 --> 01:34:01,640
Again, I can't draw eyes.

1536
01:34:02,640 --> 01:34:03,640
So...

1537
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:05,640
Bear with me.

1538
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:09,640
Because I tend to...

1539
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:12,640
If I'm looking at something...

1540
01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:15,640
I also really only...

1541
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:20,640
When I did anime-styled characters,

1542
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:25,640
it was either in the cute and funny style

1543
01:34:25,640 --> 01:34:26,640
or it was...

1544
01:34:27,640 --> 01:34:28,640
Or it was...

1545
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:31,640
What's it called?

1546
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:33,640
Like the soul leader style.

1547
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:38,640
So I guess I'm just going to draw cute and funny bimbo.

1548
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:41,640
Slime girl.

1549
01:34:44,640 --> 01:34:45,640
Let's see.

1550
01:34:51,640 --> 01:34:52,640
Mm-hmm.

1551
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:16,640
Better be drooling.

1552
01:35:16,640 --> 01:35:17,640
Okay, fine.

1553
01:35:17,640 --> 01:35:19,640
I'll give her a worse...

1554
01:35:20,640 --> 01:35:22,640
A better expression then.

1555
01:35:24,640 --> 01:35:26,640
I gotta give her a fucking expression.

1556
01:35:31,640 --> 01:35:32,640
Let's see.

1557
01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:54,640
This looks like some kind of in her mouth.

1558
01:35:57,640 --> 01:35:58,640
Yoiks.

1559
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:06,640
Put the eyes up too high.

1560
01:36:06,640 --> 01:36:07,640
What am I doing.

1561
01:36:20,640 --> 01:36:22,140
dick

1562
01:36:22,140 --> 01:36:23,120
if

1563
01:36:23,120 --> 01:36:24,620
pe

1564
01:36:24,620 --> 01:36:26,620
if

1565
01:36:26,620 --> 01:36:27,120

It's big big in eyes like me

1594
01:38:32,680 --> 01:38:35,000
They are just holes

1595
01:38:51,080 --> 01:38:53,080
I

1596
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:56,120
Don't know why but I feel like this is gonna turn into like a

1597
01:39:03,560 --> 01:39:08,880
Kusugaki bratty expression, okay, I don't like this I feel like it should be bigger

1598
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:15,880
The thing I like about digital art is that I can like drag stuff and make them larger

1599
01:39:17,560 --> 01:39:19,560
But I don't know how to do that

1600
01:39:20,920 --> 01:39:25,160
How do I make this bigger scale? Oh, no, that's not it

1601
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:30,160
I mean you still I just like what I don't know how to resize something

1602
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:36,760
Let's make the eye closer and more up I suppose

1603
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,680
How do I make this bigger edit?

1604
01:39:44,160 --> 01:39:46,480
Is that just not a thing that you do and

1605
01:39:48,240 --> 01:39:50,240
Whatever I don't care anymore

1606
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:52,400
I

1607
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:57,280
Need to cut it

1608
01:39:57,920 --> 01:40:00,800
Drag the corner, what do you mean drag though fuck

1609
01:40:02,040 --> 01:40:06,800
Don't worry about it. It's fine. It's fine. It's gonna race this weird fucking thing

1610
01:40:08,160 --> 01:40:10,160
Actually, I'll do that

1611
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:22,400
Oh

1612
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:49,520
How to give her like the

1613
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:51,600
Damn, she looks like she's crying

1614
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:59,160
I'm never like satisfied with like specific eye styles

1615
01:40:59,160 --> 01:41:01,160
I

1616
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:25,400
Gotta get the big boat lashes in it big boat lashes

1617
01:41:29,160 --> 01:41:32,480
Simple is better with those tiny circles. Yeah, I'm kind of feeling the same thing

1618
01:41:34,840 --> 01:41:36,840
Cuz this is looks like shit

1619
01:41:41,320 --> 01:41:43,320
I prefer like a simpler

1620
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:49,440
Style when it comes to eyes. I realize I just can't do the

1621
01:41:50,120 --> 01:41:52,360
Really fancy like eye rendering

1622
01:41:53,160 --> 01:41:56,440
And I'll like read about how to do it and shit, but I just can't do it

1623
01:41:59,720 --> 01:42:10,920
She looks like a fucking alien cuz her eyes are so far apart

1624
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:14,840
What the hell I hate it

1625
01:42:17,160 --> 01:42:19,480
Get rid of it disgusting

1626
01:42:20,840 --> 01:42:22,840
I don't know should I go disgusting shit

1627
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:31,400
Try again, we will make the slime girl. I promise you I'm just a very fussy artist

1628
01:42:36,920 --> 01:42:41,560
Just kidding. I'm probably lying. I'm probably not gonna draw anything cuz I hate

1629
01:42:44,600 --> 01:42:46,600
Anything that I draw

1630
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:52,680
See then I'm like, let's change the eye style up. Shall we you know

1631
01:42:52,920 --> 01:42:54,920
and then

1632
01:42:56,200 --> 01:42:58,200
Cuz I haven't been able to

1633
01:43:06,200 --> 01:43:10,040
I haven't been able to find like a style that I like so that I can teach myself

1634
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:15,560
It looks so amazing before too bad. I don't like it

1635
01:43:16,520 --> 01:43:18,520
I

1636
01:43:24,280 --> 01:43:28,360
Is is she gonna draw anything this stream? No, she's not

1637
01:43:30,520 --> 01:43:32,520
Whatever made you think that

1638
01:43:37,160 --> 01:43:40,120
I'm gonna have a blank canvas by the end perhaps

1639
01:43:41,160 --> 01:43:43,160
Live I thought this was Hanukkah

1640
01:43:44,120 --> 01:43:49,800
She's Jewish now. She's a Jewish slime girl. Okay, like

1641
01:43:51,880 --> 01:43:53,880
She's a little melt in a little bit, you know

1642
01:43:54,680 --> 01:43:59,480
Let's how about we now focus on the face we just focused on like her hair something

1643
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:02,600
That looks weird. I don't know why she did it like that

1644
01:44:09,880 --> 01:44:11,400
So

1645
01:44:11,480 --> 01:44:13,480
The hair kind of like goes

1646
01:44:13,560 --> 01:44:17,640
Into itself when it comes to like slime girls, so I'm just gonna

1647
01:44:20,120 --> 01:44:26,440
I'm I kind I'm kind of feeling a bayang, you know, I think we should do like a like a very like exaggerated

1648
01:44:27,800 --> 01:44:30,280
Melty bayang. Yeah

1649
01:44:35,480 --> 01:44:37,480
Yeah, I'm feeling that

1650
01:44:38,600 --> 01:44:41,160
And then she's like emo she doesn't want to be here

1651
01:44:41,800 --> 01:44:44,440
But wait, she's a bimbo. That doesn't really fit the theme

1652
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,560
I'm feeling very inspired by like

1653
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:01,960
Elec from nicky

1654
01:45:03,240 --> 01:45:06,840
Just want like a little bang moment, you know

1655
01:45:12,360 --> 01:45:17,400
I just love like bangs that completely cover the eyes. That's all I can say. I don't know what to tell you

1656
01:45:18,600 --> 01:45:21,480
It looks like I'm just drawing a slime ball. So I guess that works

1657
01:45:22,200 --> 01:45:24,200
Like her to the wrong ball

1658
01:45:32,600 --> 01:45:40,040
And then we'll just like kind of bring it over there we'll just drip a little bit over there, you know a little

1659
01:45:41,640 --> 01:45:43,640
A

1660
01:45:47,720 --> 01:45:52,040
This looks kind of gross, but you know, that's the best part am I right

1661
01:45:55,560 --> 01:45:57,560
It looks definitely like a ball of spit

1662
01:46:03,960 --> 01:46:09,240
It looks like something and she may have come you know, we'll never know

1663
01:46:12,360 --> 01:46:14,840
Only a select few will know

1664
01:46:29,880 --> 01:46:34,520
She's a jar slime. Oh, I like that. She's a bimbo jar slime

1665
01:46:38,920 --> 01:46:41,000
Oh god

1666
01:46:41,080 --> 01:46:47,880
What have I created? What have we made together? I can't believe you've done this

1667
01:47:00,120 --> 01:47:03,800
Let's give her some cute ponytails, you know, we gotta

1668
01:47:04,600 --> 01:47:06,600
We'll do like

1669
01:47:06,680 --> 01:47:08,680
Little those cute

1670
01:47:08,920 --> 01:47:10,920
All scrunchy things

1671
01:47:11,800 --> 01:47:21,880
And then she'll just have a little melty ponytails, okay, I guess I'm just drawing a cute and funny bimbo slime

1672
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:27,800
I'm kind of feeling her though

1673
01:47:29,080 --> 01:47:31,080
She's you know

1674
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:34,520
She's doing the most she can

1675
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
I

1676
01:47:43,240 --> 01:47:47,480
Drop drop a little okay, I got you

1677
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:06,600
She's like kind of she doesn't have a brain this is her brain it's very smooth

1678
01:48:06,760 --> 01:48:08,760
Enough

1679
01:48:10,280 --> 01:48:15,960
Let's give her a cute little like she she tries to pin her hair up, but she can't

1680
01:48:18,120 --> 01:48:20,120
That just looks fucking weird actually never mind

1681
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:23,800
We'll give her a

1682
01:48:27,640 --> 01:48:31,800
We'll we'll work on the accessories we'll work on the accessories later

1683
01:48:32,040 --> 01:48:37,080
I'm doing a new layer for the face

1684
01:48:39,080 --> 01:48:41,080
Because I actually like what I have going on right here

1685
01:48:48,360 --> 01:48:54,040
So we got we got to do like one giant big fucking eye like what

1686
01:48:54,760 --> 01:48:56,760
Oh

1687
01:48:58,360 --> 01:49:01,560
Like why did you put me in this jar on each hand?

1688
01:49:06,200 --> 01:49:10,360
You're liking big braided bangs and long braided hair in the back

1689
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
You think I can draw a braid

1690
01:49:17,320 --> 01:49:21,160
She has hair sleep shaped slime that's what she's just made of slime, you know

1691
01:49:21,960 --> 01:49:23,960
Damn what the fuck

1692
01:49:33,480 --> 01:49:39,640
Okay, I'm liking this I'm liking it I think I don't know we'll keep going and find out

1693
01:49:52,120 --> 01:49:54,120
Oh

1694
01:49:56,280 --> 01:49:59,640
She kind of has a like a like a pissed off girl expression

1695
01:50:07,240 --> 01:50:14,600
She's a she's a distant relative of straw knee, but she's like a like a slug like a sea slug made of slime

1696
01:50:22,120 --> 01:50:36,920
She's like I really don't want to be here, bro. Like why did you take me to this weird ass mall?

1697
01:50:38,280 --> 01:50:40,280
Let's give her freckles

1698
01:50:40,520 --> 01:50:42,520
Now she's just emmy never mind

1699
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:44,840
She's just emmy covered in a jar, you know

1700
01:50:45,720 --> 01:50:47,720
Ink v type of slime

1701
01:50:47,720 --> 01:50:51,240
Ooh good point good point

1702
01:51:17,720 --> 01:51:20,440
She's a slime girl audio cooking what I didn't know that

1703
01:51:24,920 --> 01:51:27,560
Again I can't draw eyes so they just pissed me off

1704
01:51:27,880 --> 01:51:32,600
Oh actually let me just erase like a normal human being

1705
01:51:45,400 --> 01:51:47,400
You know what actually

1706
01:51:47,400 --> 01:51:50,920
Obviously she has to have her tongue out, you know and then a little bit of

1707
01:51:52,680 --> 01:51:54,680
A little bit of wool there, you know

1708
01:51:55,160 --> 01:51:57,160
I

1709
01:51:58,760 --> 01:52:00,760
Thank you

1710
01:52:03,960 --> 01:52:06,360
Let's see I like I like the big eyes

1711
01:52:09,720 --> 01:52:11,720
Actually like

1712
01:52:15,320 --> 01:52:20,040
What are the what are these eyelashes doing is the question, you know like what's what's going on here?

1713
01:52:20,040 --> 01:52:22,040
I

1714
01:52:23,080 --> 01:52:25,080
Erase the eye start over

1715
01:52:31,800 --> 01:52:38,600
I've seen you draw solid eyes like three times you're good. No, I'm not nothing's good here

1716
01:52:44,040 --> 01:52:48,120
Although actually the way that was kind of looks like would be a cute pin area

1717
01:52:50,440 --> 01:52:56,440
And then I could just be like this type of eye

1718
01:53:05,960 --> 01:53:10,520
Might need to know erase her challenge is that a thing because I would not survive

1719
01:53:14,520 --> 01:53:16,520
Thank you for the super

1720
01:53:20,680 --> 01:53:24,120
I kind of want her to have like a oh you disgust me look on her face

1721
01:53:38,120 --> 01:53:41,960
Bro see notice how I do like 50 different eye styles when I'm drawing something

1722
01:53:50,680 --> 01:53:52,680
You

01:53:55,640 --> 01:53:57,640

1724
01:53:59,640 --> 01:54:02,120
You can't go wrong with soul eater eyes

1725
01:54:06,520 --> 01:54:08,520
Brock eyes from focus on

01:54:10,440 --> 01:54:13,960
You can't go wrong with them. They're just they're just they're just lovely, you know

1727
01:54:17,080 --> 01:54:19,080
Oh, I don't like the color in the

1728
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
I

1729
01:54:27,240 --> 01:54:29,240
But I also I don't like it

1730
01:54:30,440 --> 01:54:32,440
But I don't like how it looks

1731
01:54:36,280 --> 01:54:38,520
No, let's just erase let's just start over. Oh fuck

1732
01:54:39,480 --> 01:54:41,480

Actually, I kind of like don't like how that shadow was like walking out this beat

1738
01:55:38,520 --> 01:55:40,520

1739
01:55:59,320 --> 01:56:02,440
Apportions never heard of them

And then hips she's like thick, you know, she's a thickums

01:57:04,040 --> 01:57:06,040
That would not be who I am today

1749
01:57:09,720 --> 01:57:11,720
The hips should be bigger

1750
01:57:13,480 --> 01:57:17,720
She's pink you can give her a hair accessory that's a clove feather. That's actually really cute

1751
01:57:19,560 --> 01:57:21,560
I actually like that

1752
01:57:22,520 --> 01:57:24,520
She's like a ink

1753
01:57:26,200 --> 01:57:28,200
Character

1754
01:57:30,920 --> 01:57:32,920
I don't know proportions

1755
01:57:35,640 --> 01:57:37,640
Should I make her o-fi

1756
01:57:40,440 --> 01:57:43,400
I'm just I just want to draw boobs, but then I'm fighting against it

1757
01:57:44,840 --> 01:57:47,240
Nari appreciation. Oh, it's nari love

1758
01:57:48,200 --> 01:57:53,400
Nari's working on my tan twuggle. I'm so excited. I could be brown

1759
01:57:56,520 --> 01:57:58,520
Um

1760
01:57:59,320 --> 01:58:01,320
I kind of want to give her like

1761
01:58:03,720 --> 01:58:06,840
I like to give her really long hair

1762
01:58:09,560 --> 01:58:11,560
Give her like really longer

1763
01:58:13,240 --> 01:58:15,240
Yeah

1764
01:58:16,120 --> 01:58:19,640
I can't believe this would be this is making me wish I was drawing on an iPad again

1765
01:58:21,160 --> 01:58:29,160
You see the editing the ears what you're getting there. Oh, yeah, that's right for some like not human ears because I was talking earlier about um

1766
01:58:30,360 --> 01:58:36,440
I don't like double ears on a camomomimi. I can't pronounce the word like just animal people

1767
01:58:39,320 --> 01:58:43,720
Maybe imagine slam girl thug shape what I don't know what that means

1768
01:58:45,640 --> 01:58:47,640
Oh

1769
01:58:47,880 --> 01:58:49,880
Okay, she's so she's got big

1770
01:58:51,640 --> 01:58:53,640
Slimy hair

1771
01:58:54,920 --> 01:58:57,880
She looks like she's kind of made out of water at this point. Um

1772
01:59:06,200 --> 01:59:09,240
I think I need to I need to stretch out her body a little bit

1773
01:59:15,560 --> 01:59:17,560
I

1774
01:59:34,600 --> 01:59:36,600
Don't know what outfit together

1775
01:59:42,120 --> 01:59:44,120
What would a bimbo slime girl wear

1776
01:59:45,480 --> 01:59:47,480
What

1777
01:59:51,560 --> 01:59:57,160
What what's what's this is like I like uh, for example, um

1778
01:59:58,520 --> 02:00:00,520
Slimes were close nothing

1779
02:00:02,440 --> 02:00:05,240
I can't draw her naked. Um

1780
02:00:06,440 --> 02:00:08,440
What's it called? Uh

1781
02:00:09,640 --> 02:00:13,640
It is helping me conceptualize like an outfit

1782
02:00:13,880 --> 02:00:21,080
For like a future 2.0. This is very distant in the future, but I just love designing things and emi does too

1783
02:00:21,240 --> 02:00:25,720
So we're just like kind of collabing on that because I like watching her um do her stream

1784
02:00:26,760 --> 02:00:28,760
um

1785
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:33,480
Like I like have ideas for things, but then it's just hard for me to bring them to life

1786
02:00:35,080 --> 02:00:37,400
But like design designing is super fun

1787
02:00:37,720 --> 02:00:45,080
Two top something waterproof, okay, I guess I'll just give her like a bathing suit

1788
02:00:49,560 --> 02:00:54,040
Wait these these proportions ain't proportioning

1789
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
She's gonna be oh bye

1790
02:01:08,360 --> 02:01:10,360
I can't draw boobies

1791
02:01:14,600 --> 02:01:20,920
I always remember someone's like draw them like like a little water bottle the water bottle water balloon

1792
02:01:25,320 --> 02:01:27,480
High like swimsuit fey watch style

1793
02:01:28,840 --> 02:01:32,440
Classic umbrella rain jacket material. Oh, that would be cute

1794
02:01:32,840 --> 02:01:34,840
See like

1795
02:01:36,840 --> 02:01:42,520
That's why I wish I was an artist because it was up to me. I'd be like, okay bathing suit the top

1796
02:01:43,960 --> 02:01:45,960
Is like this

1797
02:01:47,080 --> 02:01:49,320
And this is where her kuchi goes

1798
02:01:50,520 --> 02:01:53,320
But then this part is like the plastic ski

1799
02:01:54,280 --> 02:01:56,920
Shit from like a like a clear rain jacket

1800
02:01:57,480 --> 02:02:01,080
And then have her wear a clear rain jacket

1801
02:02:01,640 --> 02:02:06,840
Over this and then give her like really big boots like big rest rain boots

1802
02:02:08,280 --> 02:02:10,280
And there you go

1803
02:02:16,440 --> 02:02:18,440
But I think that would be cute

1804
02:02:19,880 --> 02:02:21,880
But I can't draw plastic

1805
02:02:24,760 --> 02:02:26,760
Perfection

1806
02:02:26,840 --> 02:02:31,320
But you get but you get what I'm saying though, right like you get where I'm coming from

1807
02:02:32,360 --> 02:02:34,360
You get you know what I mean

1808
02:02:34,360 --> 02:02:36,600
You know what I mean jelly bean

1809
02:02:37,320 --> 02:02:39,480
I'm not finishing an actual drawing by the end of the stream

1810
02:02:39,480 --> 02:02:42,680
By the way, I hope you I hope you guys don't think I'm gonna finish a drawing because that's

1811
02:02:43,560 --> 02:02:48,680
That's never gonna happen ever. I've never finished a drawing in my entire life that picture of um

1812
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:55,240
Saliva is just sitting on my iPad only ahead

1813
02:02:57,560 --> 02:03:02,760
Actually, let me see if I can just show you guys it

1814
02:03:09,720 --> 02:03:11,720
Wait, but I posted it on my pl

1815
02:03:13,080 --> 02:03:15,080
I don't know if I'm feeling logging into that again though

1816
02:03:20,520 --> 02:03:22,520
It's time for a moment

1817
02:03:22,680 --> 02:03:29,320
No top boots with the laces tied together around her neck to cover her bro, I just choked on my almond

1818
02:03:32,280 --> 02:03:34,280
If she was pet time then yes

1819
02:03:45,080 --> 02:03:47,080
It would just be like

1820
02:03:47,080 --> 02:03:49,080
How about even fucking work

1821
02:03:52,680 --> 02:03:58,200
Somebody said hi leg so we'll do some hi leg

1822
02:04:13,080 --> 02:04:15,160

I see if you taking her quest no, especially not from grain aims

1827
02:04:42,840 --> 02:04:48,040
You can always start changing that never finishing anything you time and feel like it. Yeah, that's a good point

1828
02:04:49,560 --> 02:04:51,560
I

1829
02:04:53,080 --> 02:04:59,160
These almonds are so good. It's a nice healthy snack. Just almonds. I recommend it

1830
02:05:02,680 --> 02:05:06,200
Let's fire that great. No, I just like to pick on people sometimes. I don't really care

Yeah, we'd like to but um, I'm also broke man

1836
02:05:39,960 --> 02:05:41,960

1869
02:08:28,360 --> 02:08:31,720
Almond's making her too. No, I think it's because I had a bowl of cereal earlier

1870
02:08:32,440 --> 02:08:35,880
I've only had a bowl of cereal in almonds today. What the fuck is wrong with me?

1871
02:08:35,880 --> 02:08:37,880
I

1872
02:08:38,120 --> 02:08:41,800
In fact, I put these almonds away. I feel like it's like not good to have too many almonds

1873
02:08:47,960 --> 02:08:49,960
Every time I see your name

02:09:22,920 --> 02:09:24,680
Also, um

1878
02:09:28,360 --> 02:09:31,080
I miscalculated how much money I had in my bank account

1879
02:09:33,240 --> 02:09:35,240
And I thought I had like

1880
02:09:35,720 --> 02:09:37,320
enough

1881
02:09:37,320 --> 02:09:39,320
to like

1882
02:09:40,200 --> 02:09:43,800
Like and I have groceries and stuff too, but like I was like I and I don't feel like make anything

1883
02:09:43,800 --> 02:09:50,040
Let me worry about but I had already ordered art from somebody that was like 90 dollars and then I'm like, oh wait

1884
02:09:50,280 --> 02:09:52,280
My account is negative two dollars

1885
02:09:58,520 --> 02:10:01,800
Mom, would you say that you're still the first person I'd like you membership to

Oh, that's very sweet. Thank you

1887
02:10:05,960 --> 02:10:07,960
What's up?

1888
02:10:08,680 --> 02:10:14,120
Excuse me girl, man. There's much cereal you eat. You should already go to natural resistance to lack

1889
02:10:16,920 --> 02:10:21,400
I actually don't eat cereal that often. I just only got cereal the last time with grocery shopping

1890
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
Um

1891
02:10:25,960 --> 02:10:27,960
Okay, I'm

1892
02:10:28,680 --> 02:10:30,680
Another

1893
02:10:36,120 --> 02:10:38,120
And um

1894
02:10:41,560 --> 02:10:43,560
What was I gonna say?

1895
02:10:44,040 --> 02:10:47,560
Um, oh, yeah, because I just saw it. I'm like, oh I haven't had cereal

1896
02:10:48,680 --> 02:10:53,160
I'm like, uh, I probably shouldn't get cereal because I don't have any I haven't I shouldn't really be drinking milk

1897
02:10:53,160 --> 02:10:56,600
And I'm like, I don't really care. It's easy to do. You're just pour milk in a bowl

1898
02:10:57,400 --> 02:11:01,720
So I got it. I got some ohs and some shiriyos and I like to make some together

1899
02:11:03,720 --> 02:11:09,400
Um, I also didn't do as much grocery shopping as I wanted to because like I said the supermarket when I went

1900
02:11:09,720 --> 02:11:13,400
All their whole like frozen food section was gone. Well, not like gone

1901
02:11:13,480 --> 02:11:15,640
it was just like out of order because the

1902
02:11:16,600 --> 02:11:18,600
the power was out

1903
02:11:19,320 --> 02:11:22,920
and um, because normally I'll get like some like oh I'll get some like

1904
02:11:23,640 --> 02:11:27,560
Uh, like salmon frozen that I just usually throw in an air fryer

1905
02:11:28,200 --> 02:11:35,560
Um, or I'll get some like chicky tendies or I'll get some like grilled chicken and then I'll like usually get like salad kits. Um

1906
02:11:36,760 --> 02:11:40,440
and like other like, uh, like vegetables and stuff

1907
02:11:41,080 --> 02:11:43,080
to put together

1908
02:11:43,080 --> 02:11:47,640
with the food but all their the whole frozen section was like destroyed so I was just like

1909
02:11:48,600 --> 02:11:54,600
Like I got syrup then I got home and I'm like wait, I don't have any I don't have any waffles for this syrup

1910
02:11:55,560 --> 02:12:02,120
So it sucked and tolerant to let me yes, I used to not be but then I stopped drinking milk for a long time during covid

1911
02:12:02,520 --> 02:12:04,520
For some reason. I don't even know why

1912
02:12:05,080 --> 02:12:07,800
and then I just like couldn't drink milk again

1913
02:12:11,480 --> 02:12:16,280
Uh, I fell in a rush to joke society somewhere near from barfolk and flooded diamond

1914
02:12:16,520 --> 02:12:18,520
Oh, that'd be cool actually

1915
02:12:21,080 --> 02:12:26,360
Don't you hear how there's never the right amount of cereal to milk creation? Yeah, I agree with that. That's pretty difficult

1916
02:12:27,080 --> 02:12:29,080
um, because I usually like

1917
02:12:29,320 --> 02:12:31,320
I'll usually like get enough milk

1918
02:12:32,600 --> 02:12:36,760
And I'll think I got enough cereal, but then it looks like I'm overflowing the bowl with too much cereal

1919
02:12:37,400 --> 02:12:38,840
and then I like

1920
02:12:38,840 --> 02:12:43,880
Get a little bit of cereal out and then I'm like, oh wait, maybe it needs more milk and then yeah, I just

1921
02:12:44,840 --> 02:12:47,960
Please no more 12 hour salmon. What do you mean? It was delicious

1922
02:12:50,280 --> 02:12:54,040
I totally had forgotten I left it out to defrost in like some water

1923
02:12:54,760 --> 02:12:58,120
But it was like it was it was covered. It was fine

1924
02:12:59,240 --> 02:13:01,240
And it was sitting in a pot in my

1925
02:13:04,200 --> 02:13:08,760
Just you know, yeah, I was aged 12 hours to perfection what sauce with attendees

1926
02:13:09,720 --> 02:13:16,120
I have this thing, you know, you need to go to the grocery store and there's always something you accidentally buy too much of

1927
02:13:16,840 --> 02:13:18,840
minus condiments

1928
02:13:20,440 --> 02:13:27,080
Like I'll be like, oh, I probably need this and then I'm like, wait, I already have like two bottles in my fridge

1929
02:13:28,680 --> 02:13:30,680
Don't worry, she should be 56

1930
02:13:31,640 --> 02:13:33,080
um

1931
02:13:33,080 --> 02:13:37,800
Each salmon sounds so wrong. Hey, you can age a steak. I've had dry aged steak

1932
02:13:38,360 --> 02:13:42,440
Um, I don't yeah, I don't know and like you can make like salmon jerky

1933
02:13:50,920 --> 02:13:57,320
I have kids don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. Uh bodies change as we get older. Yeah at the ripe age of

1934
02:13:58,200 --> 02:14:00,920
56 my totally real age. Um

1935
02:14:02,040 --> 02:14:06,120
I'm just my body is just shutting down. I'm probably on the verge of death

1936
02:14:07,800 --> 02:14:09,800
Ha ha ha

1937
02:14:09,800 --> 02:14:11,800
Wet aged salmon

1938
02:14:13,560 --> 02:14:17,320
How does it use to eat shrimp all the time hit 30 and he's allergic that sucks

1939
02:14:17,960 --> 02:14:19,560
That sucks. So like I love seafood

1940
02:14:19,560 --> 02:14:25,000
I love seafood since I was a kid when I was younger at my mom would get annoyed with me because we go to a restaurant as like a special

1941
02:14:25,240 --> 02:14:31,880
Special little treat and I try to order like the shrimp scampi or like a lobster dish at age like seven

1942
02:14:33,080 --> 02:14:36,200
Because I just love seafood so much and I still do

1943
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:38,440
um

1944
02:14:38,440 --> 02:14:42,280
And if if I was allergic to shellfish, I would probably cry

1945
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
I would probably just curb it

1946
02:14:45,240 --> 02:14:48,120
Uh minecraft myself exactly same

1947
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
So just give me chills

1948
02:14:51,160 --> 02:14:55,240
Man a few streams ago you mentioned emi making you crave jerky. So I ended up getting jerky as well

1949
02:14:55,240 --> 02:14:57,240
And I got jerky when I went grocery shopping

1950
02:14:58,280 --> 02:15:03,640
Emi's just a trend center. I don't know what to tell you my little cute sister is just so influential

1951
02:15:04,280 --> 02:15:06,120
um

1952
02:15:06,280 --> 02:15:08,280
On the verge of digging the forbidden hole

1953
02:15:09,720 --> 02:15:12,760
I like however coming up with all these analogies for dying

1954
02:15:14,120 --> 02:15:17,480
Why the fuck you dying your t-shirts, of course

1955
02:15:18,200 --> 02:15:20,200
We're doing tie-dye

1956
02:15:20,280 --> 02:15:23,240
Tie-dice. Ooh tie-dye hand cam stream

1957
02:15:24,040 --> 02:15:25,320
yo

1958
02:15:25,320 --> 02:15:27,320
You can cost so much you right

1959
02:15:27,640 --> 02:15:29,640
I'm about to put jerky upon my throat

1960
02:15:30,360 --> 02:15:34,600
I'm sorry to go. No, I want more jerky. I bought my own jerky though

1961
02:15:35,560 --> 02:15:37,560
Came ending

1962
02:15:37,560 --> 02:15:44,040
Well being allergic to shellfish shrimp is tasty worth it. Um the only thing I think I might be allergic to is kiwis

1963
02:15:44,360 --> 02:15:45,400
Which is just weird

1964
02:15:45,400 --> 02:15:52,200
I don't understand why I would be allergic to kiwis because I'll have a kiwi and I've eaten kiwis like my entire life

1965
02:15:52,520 --> 02:15:55,160
But I was telling someone and they're just like

1966
02:15:56,120 --> 02:16:03,800
I'm like, oh, I love it how like kiwis are almost like spicy like almost like they're carbonated and like sizzle in your mouth and then someone was just like

1967
02:16:05,160 --> 02:16:08,440
That's not supposed to happen when you eat a kiwi and I'm like

1968
02:16:10,040 --> 02:16:12,040
Uh, no

1969
02:16:13,320 --> 02:16:17,800
I'm like that isn't that like it's like, you know, like it's like almost sour. They're like, no

1970
02:16:18,760 --> 02:16:20,120
that's

1971
02:16:20,120 --> 02:16:26,280
That's you're allergic and I'm like, oh that sucks and then I just kept eating a kiwi because it's not like it doesn't affect me affect me

1972
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:28,040
um

1973
02:16:28,040 --> 02:16:30,600
And then my life ended when I found out I was allergic to rabbits

1974
02:16:30,600 --> 02:16:33,240
That was that was actually an actual travesty

1975
02:16:33,800 --> 02:16:37,400
Because rabbits are so cute and I almost died while petting one

1976
02:16:38,440 --> 02:16:43,720
Because I just if I touched I touched my face after uh spending time with a rabbit

1977
02:16:44,600 --> 02:16:48,680
And my throat started to close and that was the only time I felt pure panic

1978
02:16:49,720 --> 02:16:51,720
um

1979
02:16:55,720 --> 02:16:58,920
As I choke my mouth is tinky anyways

1980
02:17:01,560 --> 02:17:04,680
Here's my oh there's a stylus. I'm like, where'd it go?

1981
02:17:05,960 --> 02:17:10,760
Okay, let's zoom in. Let's let's go to the next step of this lovely

1982
02:17:11,480 --> 02:17:13,240
whoa

1983
02:17:13,240 --> 02:17:14,680
thing

1984
02:17:14,680 --> 02:17:20,440
Which is line art because you know, we're finished here. She looks great. She's

1985
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,480
You know, she might be a little bit of a chicken nugget

1986
02:17:24,440 --> 02:17:26,440
Hi

1987
02:17:30,040 --> 02:17:32,040
Actually, I don't want to look at her

1988
02:17:34,040 --> 02:17:36,040
Let's get rid of her

1989
02:17:39,960 --> 02:17:44,440
Let's let's draw with blue. Yeah, that's nice

1990
02:17:45,240 --> 02:17:47,240
I

1991
02:17:49,800 --> 02:17:51,800
I mean for what a nugget you guys didn't know before

1992
02:17:58,360 --> 02:18:03,080
Our vtubers talking about nugget what you don't like chicken nuggets sideswipe prime

1993
02:18:03,160 --> 02:18:05,160
I

1994
02:18:05,160 --> 02:18:07,160

What's it called like I really want fried chicken

1998
02:18:24,760 --> 02:18:27,720
Question is she we don't have to show my work. What the fuck does that mean?

1999
02:18:27,720 --> 02:18:29,720
What the fuck

2000

2034
02:21:26,600 --> 02:21:31,720
When people ask me if I if I know the sauce or if I got the sauce, I I am saucing

2035
02:21:32,040 --> 02:21:34,040
I am constantly saucing

2036
02:21:35,800 --> 02:21:40,200
Special, yeah, I just have I just have come in my fridge. That's totally what the special sauce is

2037
02:21:40,840 --> 02:21:44,200
As a fellow sauce enthusiast, there's no such thing as too many condiments

2038
02:21:44,840 --> 02:21:48,360
A fridge with condiments is not me. I got it from

2039
02:21:49,640 --> 02:21:52,600
Sausage, yeah, I could survive purely on sauces

2040
02:21:54,200 --> 02:21:59,080
Where's the lamb sauce? What the fuck is lamb sauce? Oh, is that like a Gordon Ramsay reference?

2041
02:22:00,040 --> 02:22:06,600
Well, worst case scenario, you could just drink condiments. Yep, lost in the sauce. Thank you

2042
02:22:08,600 --> 02:22:13,000
Oh my god, my ear just got really fucking itchy. Don't you get it when your ear just gets really tickly all of a sudden?

2043
02:22:20,120 --> 02:22:24,120
Okay, over here. I'm alive. My sauce stuck. Sausage buck

2044
02:22:25,080 --> 02:22:30,760
Fridge review when oh god, no you can't I see guys will just oh wait, I thought you meant I

02:22:31,480 --> 02:22:36,520
You review my fridge. I mean I review your fridges. I don't want to feel bad that I don't have enough food

2046
02:22:39,400 --> 02:22:42,760
I'm saucing I'm saucing I'm saucing on you

2047

I also can't draw myself I realized I can't draw my own hair

2048
02:22:54,120 --> 02:22:56,120
I

2049
02:22:56,680 --> 02:22:59,560
Like don't know why I can't but I can't

2050
02:23:01,240 --> 02:23:04,280
It's very difficult for me to draw my own hair

2051
02:23:05,960 --> 02:23:11,640
Sauce and the damn lost skill issues. That's a sign of spider infestation. What?

2052
02:23:12,920 --> 02:23:14,920
What do you mean?

2053
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:19,240
What does that mean? So, so spider infestation

2054
02:23:19,560 --> 02:23:21,560
I

2055
02:23:21,800 --> 02:23:26,760
Think his hair is one wow. All right. What the fuck is this shape then?

2056
02:23:31,160 --> 02:23:33,160
What is that shape, huh? Tell me

2057
02:23:34,520 --> 02:23:39,000
Tell me I just want to draw really inappropriate things. I'll be honest with you, but I can't because

2058
02:23:40,600 --> 02:23:42,600
Where on YouTube? Um

2059
02:23:43,560 --> 02:23:45,800
So like let me draw my hair like

2060
02:23:46,760 --> 02:23:48,760
I like how my bangs are asymmetrical

2061
02:23:52,120 --> 02:23:56,680
And then I got a little bit of that a little like a little vampire fang moment

2062
02:23:58,280 --> 02:24:00,760
Oh, I accidentally pressed a button

2063
02:24:03,160 --> 02:24:06,040
What the hell what the hell

2064
02:24:07,720 --> 02:24:09,880
Bro, I can't even do my little side thing

2065
02:24:10,600 --> 02:24:17,240
It's usually like I'm so used to drawing like stuff like that, but I'm like have to draw like that

2066
02:24:18,600 --> 02:24:20,600

2067
02:24:20,760 --> 02:24:23,000
Be not afraid. This looks like a cat ear

2068
02:24:25,480 --> 02:24:27,480
And I'm just turning myself into a fox girl

2069
02:24:29,240 --> 02:24:34,040
Can you draw the hair a mascot? No, I can't

2070
02:24:39,880 --> 02:24:41,880
I

2071
02:24:55,880 --> 02:24:57,880

I also never drew in like an anime anime style

2089
02:26:39,960 --> 02:26:41,960

02:26:42,040 --> 02:26:48,040
Didn't look good it was more like this is like the style I used to draw and it was like very

We look so nice together. We're going on a date

2150
02:32:38,120 --> 02:32:41,720
I'm just kidding. I don't date my clients. Why would I ever do that? It's terrible

2151
02:32:44,440 --> 02:32:46,440
Fabulous

2152
02:32:47,080 --> 02:32:50,920
Are you holding a knife? It's not a knife. It's my crew

2153
02:32:54,040 --> 02:32:56,040
It's my crop

2154
02:32:58,680 --> 02:33:04,440
She says she can't draw anymore and then comes up in the swastvrape

2155
02:33:07,640 --> 02:33:09,640
Knife to Matthew. Nice job, Mercy

2156
02:33:11,480 --> 02:33:13,480
Knife to Matthew

2157
02:33:14,920 --> 02:33:16,920
Knife to meet you

2158
02:33:19,400 --> 02:33:21,400
I saw Mercy's knife

2159
02:33:22,440 --> 02:33:26,520
I'm gonna draw Mercy above. She's gonna be flying down from the heavens

2160
02:33:29,320 --> 02:33:31,320
I

2161
02:33:32,840 --> 02:33:34,840
Wait, I gotta draw a boob

2162
02:33:35,720 --> 02:33:41,800
What the fuck does your outfit look like? I can't remember. I'm just gonna wear draw your open skirt thingy

2163
02:33:42,440 --> 02:33:45,320
um and then people forget that

2164
02:33:46,520 --> 02:33:48,520
Mercy's hair is in

2165
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:53,000
Isn't a ponytail

2166
02:33:53,560 --> 02:33:55,960
People think her hair. I thought her hair was up

2167
02:33:56,520 --> 02:34:00,520
I mean, I thought her hair was down, but it's actually in a ponytail held by the

2168
02:34:01,480 --> 02:34:04,120
Um skizzers. In fact, let me do that now

2169
02:34:05,800 --> 02:34:07,800
And tada

2170
02:34:08,600 --> 02:34:13,160
And I can't remember what your hair looks like up top of my head and then we got the eye patch

2171
02:34:14,280 --> 02:34:16,280
your normal eye

2172
02:34:17,080 --> 02:34:19,080
And then I'll put an X on this

2173
02:34:19,400 --> 02:34:21,400
Wait, no, it's an O. Oh, that's fine

2174
02:34:22,200 --> 02:34:24,200
And that's Mercy

2175
02:34:26,280 --> 02:34:28,280
I'm not beating my phone. I like it now

2176
02:34:29,160 --> 02:34:33,080
I'll give you a little cape because you're flying. It wasn't a dumpy. That's her bow

2177
02:34:34,360 --> 02:34:36,360
This is her bow

2178
02:34:36,360 --> 02:34:38,360
This is her bow

2179
02:34:38,680 --> 02:34:40,680
That's your bow

2180
02:34:51,560 --> 02:34:53,560
Those cheeks flap and

2181
02:34:53,560 --> 02:34:55,560
Straight off a DC comic

2182
02:34:56,440 --> 02:35:02,280
Yeah, this is nice. Um, in fact, sure. I'll draw icy off of that

2183
02:35:02,840 --> 02:35:07,640
I have really bad memories of what my gen mates and everybody looks like to be honest. Um

2184
02:35:08,440 --> 02:35:10,440
Oh my god, I need to

2185
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:14,600
Pull my pants down. Sorry. I know that sounds weird, but they were like writing up

2186
02:35:15,800 --> 02:35:17,960
Uh, okay, so I'll draw

2187
02:35:23,480 --> 02:35:25,480
You look so happy to be honest

2188
02:35:26,600 --> 02:35:30,280
I see with the wings. Okay, so this is icy

2189
02:35:31,720 --> 02:35:33,720
Can't remember how her bangs work

2190
02:35:34,360 --> 02:35:36,600
But she got a little polar bear ears

2191
02:35:37,560 --> 02:35:39,560
Your hair is short

2192
02:35:44,680 --> 02:35:47,960
You know, gotta give her the the evil look, um

2193
02:35:49,560 --> 02:35:51,560
And then

2194
02:35:51,640 --> 02:35:53,640
Gotta give her her little vest

2195
02:35:54,840 --> 02:35:58,760
She looks like the fucking monkey from a land

2196
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:09,000
Safety abster

2197
02:36:12,360 --> 02:36:15,800
Please don't hurt me snowberries. Um, thank you

2198
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:21,000
Who is this sassy little child? I'll give her her little booby bumps

2199
02:36:21,640 --> 02:36:23,640
Little mosquito bites

2200
02:36:23,880 --> 02:36:27,320
Um, and it's kind of like a puff jacket. So these are the little puffs

2201
02:36:29,800 --> 02:36:31,800
Those are the puffs, okay

2202
02:36:32,680 --> 02:36:35,240
Um, is there fur on it? I can't remember it. Let's just

2203
02:36:35,640 --> 02:36:38,600
No, yeah, this I think there's like fur on the top or is that's Emmy

2204
02:36:38,600 --> 02:36:41,880
I can't remember. I don't know why both girls are wearing vests, but they are

2205
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:45,480
Oh, and then we got the spats

2206
02:36:46,680 --> 02:36:48,680
Then she has like a belt thingy

2207
02:36:49,640 --> 02:36:51,640
And then she got some thick thighs

2208
02:36:57,240 --> 02:36:59,240
And then she got a little boots

2209
02:36:59,400 --> 02:37:05,000
She's kind of looking a little bit masculine, so let me get

2210
02:37:08,200 --> 02:37:10,600
She's blushing that looks like a mustache

2211
02:37:12,520 --> 02:37:17,480
Okay, and she has a tail you can't really see it, but I'm gonna put her off to the side. It looks like a wee wee never mind

2212
02:37:18,520 --> 02:37:20,920
Um, but yeah, that's and she's got like

2213
02:37:22,040 --> 02:37:24,040
I realize her her

2214
02:37:24,120 --> 02:37:26,120
It's it's supposed to be shorter

2215
02:37:26,840 --> 02:37:28,840
Let me just cut this off

2216
02:37:29,960 --> 02:37:36,600
Because then she has the the bite mark and then her tights

2217
02:37:38,680 --> 02:37:44,440
And then they're ripped and you guys can clearly tell that they're ripped, right? Okay, let me call these spats in

2218
02:37:45,400 --> 02:37:47,000
That's icy

2219
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:49,000
It's one to one exactly

2220
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:54,440
It looks just it looks just like her. Um, I'll put straw knee over this side

2221
02:37:56,280 --> 02:37:58,280
Uh, and this is straw knee

2222
02:38:00,200 --> 02:38:02,200
Um

2223
02:38:03,080 --> 02:38:05,080
What's the scotland flag look like

2224
02:38:05,880 --> 02:38:07,880
It's gonna give her a scotland flag mask

2225
02:38:08,360 --> 02:38:12,280
Um, this is straw knee. Hold on. Let me give her give her some

2226
02:38:13,160 --> 02:38:18,520
What the fuck? I just gave her like a black eye. Um, let me give her some more seductive eyes, you know

2227
02:38:21,080 --> 02:38:23,480
Like oh reefling. Oh

2230
02:38:34,920 --> 02:38:36,920

Um, and then she has the bayang

2232
02:38:46,040 --> 02:38:49,800
And I can't remember what her little side things look like but they're like that. I think it's like

2233
02:38:50,680 --> 02:38:51,800
Yeah

2234
02:38:51,800 --> 02:38:59,960
And then she's got her little weird shells that I thought were her ears for the longest time when I first saw her model until recently and she was just like no

2235
02:39:01,240 --> 02:39:03,560
I'm actually impressed at how much this looks like her. Um

2236
02:39:04,680 --> 02:39:07,080
And then she has like a little like pom-pom thing at the end

2237
02:39:07,880 --> 02:39:13,800
It's not a pom-pom. It's the rest of her thing. Um, what is her outfit look like she has a yukata

2238
02:39:15,800 --> 02:39:17,800
Um

2239
02:39:18,520 --> 02:39:25,160
Yukata yukata yukata yukata kata kata kata kata kata kata drop the base. Um

2240
02:39:26,600 --> 02:39:29,320
And she has like the little thingy here

2241
02:39:30,840 --> 02:39:33,960
And then she has like the thing that holds up her titties

2242
02:39:34,920 --> 02:39:38,920
By the way, that's a push-up bra if you guys didn't know, um

2243
02:39:40,360 --> 02:39:42,360
I think I just exposed my mother

2244
02:39:42,520 --> 02:39:49,480
She's got that snatched waist. She's got the little, you know band-aid moment

2245
02:39:51,320 --> 02:39:53,320
I don't know what the fuck that is. Um

2246
02:40:02,280 --> 02:40:05,800
I know that was supposed to be part of her dress, but now it's her body

2247
02:40:12,600 --> 02:40:14,600
Oh

2248
02:40:24,120 --> 02:40:29,880
Wait, no, no, that's not that's that's Aladdin. What the fuck is that? Why do I'm Aladdin on the mind?

2249
02:40:31,640 --> 02:40:33,640
Uh, that's the song

2250
02:40:36,360 --> 02:40:42,120
Up where they walk up where they run up where they play all day

2251
02:40:42,520 --> 02:40:47,560
The sun wandering free wish I could be

2252
02:40:48,520 --> 02:40:50,520
part of

2253
02:40:57,960 --> 02:41:00,680

I want to see you want to see him dancing walking around on those

2255
02:41:08,360 --> 02:41:10,360

You're hitting all my good spots

2261
02:41:38,280 --> 02:41:40,280
She's just a fish

2262
02:41:43,560 --> 02:41:46,760
She's not even a mermaid. Um, I'll give her a little feed

2263
02:41:52,360 --> 02:41:58,040
Um, give her a little she's not even a fish. She's just I'm gonna say she's a squid. She's a cuttlefish

I don't know why I made her look like a little boy, but it's fine

2270
02:42:55,400 --> 02:42:57,400
I don't know what these are

2271
02:42:59,480 --> 02:43:01,480

Hey

2394
02:53:22,920 --> 02:53:26,440
Um, let's get rid of that. Let me just get up real close to personal

2395
02:53:27,800 --> 02:53:52,600
ᵍᵆᵔᶉᵏᵇᵗ ᵈᶜᶉᶉᵑᶉᵇᶉᵈᶦ Studien

2396
02:53:52,600 --> 02:53:55,400
ᵷᶇ ᶦᶚᶉᶗʷᶉᶂᶑᶉᶒᶎᶉᶋ

2397
02:53:55,400 --> 02:53:59,400
Stop. You gonna make me blush.

2398
02:54:00,400 --> 02:54:01,400
Stop.

2399
02:54:03,400 --> 02:54:04,400
Great stream.

2400
02:54:04,400 --> 02:54:09,400
What do you mean, great stream? Am I ending? Are you ending my stream for me?

2401
02:54:10,400 --> 02:54:11,400
You're really close.

2402
02:54:21,400 --> 02:54:22,400
I smell nice.

2403
02:54:26,400 --> 02:54:27,400
Stop.

2404
02:54:30,400 --> 02:54:31,400
Stop.

2405
02:54:34,400 --> 02:54:35,400
Stop.

2406
02:54:38,400 --> 02:54:40,400
Am I E.B.? I don't know if I'm E.B.

2407
02:54:41,400 --> 02:54:43,400
I might be a little E.B.

2408
02:54:44,400 --> 02:54:48,400
Maybe I'm over tired. I don't know.

2409
02:54:49,400 --> 02:54:51,400
Adam acts like a creepy asmr.

2410
02:54:51,400 --> 02:54:57,400
Hey, do you mind leaning forward?

2411
02:54:58,400 --> 02:54:59,400
Yeah.

2412
02:55:00,400 --> 02:55:07,400
I'm just gonna put my camera right at this thing. Perfect. Don't move. No, it's fine.

2413
02:55:09,400 --> 02:55:11,400
Why am I trying to get an upskirt shot? No, it doesn't matter.

2414
02:55:14,400 --> 02:55:18,400
Your stream. What are you doing in my swamp?

2415
02:55:19,400 --> 02:55:21,400
E.B. wants to smell your hair.

2416
02:55:34,400 --> 02:55:38,400
Oh, that's a good one.

2417
02:55:41,400 --> 02:55:42,400
Wow.

2418
02:55:43,400 --> 02:55:48,400
Oh, by the way, so I was gonna, I'll probably mostly look up scripts.

2419
02:55:48,400 --> 02:55:50,400
I just realized something about my eyes.

2420
02:55:53,400 --> 02:55:55,400
One of my eyes is darker than the other.

2421
02:55:58,400 --> 02:55:59,400
What?

2422
02:56:00,400 --> 02:56:03,400
Like my light shine. One is white and one is not.

2423
02:56:07,400 --> 02:56:10,400
What the fuck? But then it goes normal.

2424
02:56:10,400 --> 02:56:12,400
And then it goes dark.

2425
02:56:13,400 --> 02:56:14,400
What?

2426
02:56:15,400 --> 02:56:16,400
Why does it work?

2427
02:56:18,400 --> 02:56:21,400
Why does it get darker? And why does the other one stay bright?

2428
02:56:22,400 --> 02:56:23,400
Sorry.

2429
02:56:24,400 --> 02:56:27,400
Wait, we're just supposed to focus on my eyes? Yeah, focus on my eyes.

2430
02:56:34,400 --> 02:56:35,400
Focus on my eyes.

2431
02:56:37,400 --> 02:56:38,400
Focus.

2432
02:56:39,400 --> 02:56:40,400
Focus on my eyes.

2433
02:56:42,400 --> 02:56:43,400
Focus on my eyes.

2434
02:56:44,400 --> 02:56:45,400
Are you focusing?

2435
02:56:51,400 --> 02:56:53,400
Okay, I'm fine. I swear I'm fine. I'm swear.

2436
02:56:56,400 --> 02:56:57,400
I look scary, y'all.

2437
02:56:59,400 --> 02:57:03,400
Hello. Hi. It's me.

2438
02:57:04,400 --> 02:57:05,400
My name is E.B.

2439
02:57:06,400 --> 02:57:07,400
Hi.

2440
02:57:08,400 --> 02:57:09,400
Hello.

2441
02:57:12,400 --> 02:57:15,400
Yeah, one is under the shadow layer. Yeah, that's what it is.

2442
02:57:16,400 --> 02:57:17,400
I know.

2443
02:57:18,400 --> 02:57:20,400
You know, can I smell you?

2444
02:57:21,400 --> 02:57:22,400
Can I smell you?

2445
02:57:23,400 --> 02:57:24,400
All right.

2446
02:57:25,400 --> 02:57:27,400
Can I get a little sniff?

2447
02:57:28,400 --> 02:57:29,400
Please.

2448
02:57:31,400 --> 02:57:32,400
Please.

2449
02:57:34,400 --> 02:57:35,400
Okay.

2450
02:57:35,400 --> 02:57:36,400
Okay.

2451
02:57:41,400 --> 02:57:42,400
That's nice.

2452
02:57:47,400 --> 02:57:48,400
What am I doing there?

2453
02:58:05,400 --> 02:58:06,400
Okay.

2454
02:58:16,400 --> 02:58:17,400
Okay.

2455
02:58:19,400 --> 02:58:21,400
Was that the correct thing?

2456
02:58:22,400 --> 02:58:24,400
Yeah, was that a lip-hoc to the moment?

2457
02:58:29,400 --> 02:58:32,400
Can't wait for everyone's memberships to vanish this week.

2458
02:58:32,400 --> 02:58:33,400
What are you talking about?

2459
02:58:36,400 --> 02:58:39,400
They want to be a part of this. Are you kidding me right now?

2460
02:58:45,400 --> 02:58:47,400
Wow, you can really see the teeth from the back of my mouth.

2461
02:58:52,400 --> 02:58:53,400
Mama, mama, mama.

2462
02:58:53,400 --> 02:58:54,400
There is your phone.

2463
02:58:58,400 --> 02:58:59,400
Yeah, they're paying double.

2464
02:59:01,400 --> 02:59:04,400
If you went into this, then you fucking tripping, boy.

2465
02:59:06,400 --> 02:59:08,400
Why the fuck would I nuke the vase?

2466
02:59:09,400 --> 02:59:10,400
I was clearing my throat.

2467
02:59:16,400 --> 02:59:17,400
See?

2468
02:59:19,400 --> 02:59:20,400
When you do voice acting,

2469
02:59:22,400 --> 02:59:26,400
and you do a lot of talking for a living,

2470
02:59:27,400 --> 02:59:29,400
I gotta clear my throat pretty often.

2471
02:59:30,400 --> 02:59:31,400
Delicious.

2472
02:59:39,400 --> 02:59:40,400
I have to fart.

2473
02:59:55,400 --> 02:59:57,400
Thank God I muted.

2474
02:59:59,400 --> 03:00:00,400
Thank God I muted.

2475
03:00:12,400 --> 03:00:13,400
That was crazy.

2476
03:00:14,400 --> 03:00:15,400
That was crazy, bro.

2477
03:00:16,400 --> 03:00:17,400
Oh my God.

2478
03:00:19,400 --> 03:00:20,400
If you guys...

2479
03:00:23,400 --> 03:00:25,400
If I unmuted that,

2480
03:00:26,400 --> 03:00:28,400
Far Bros would be eating so good.

2481
03:00:34,400 --> 03:00:35,400
Yes, it did.

2482
03:00:35,400 --> 03:00:38,400
What I hate about being a woman is that sometimes

2483
03:00:39,400 --> 03:00:40,400
you have to...

2484
03:00:41,400 --> 03:00:42,400
Well, you don't have to,

2485
03:00:42,400 --> 03:00:43,400
but it just happens.

2486
03:00:43,400 --> 03:00:44,400
You clearly can't control it.

2487
03:00:44,400 --> 03:00:45,400
Sometimes you too,

2488
03:00:45,400 --> 03:00:47,400
and it goes towards the front

2489
03:00:50,400 --> 03:00:51,400
and says,

2490
03:00:51,400 --> 03:00:54,400
pardon me, excuse me, towards your front bits.

2491
03:00:55,400 --> 03:00:56,400
And then,

2492
03:00:56,400 --> 03:00:58,400
those like to talk and speak up.

2493
03:00:59,400 --> 03:01:02,400
So, she says she needs to confirm.

2494
03:01:02,400 --> 03:01:04,400
But it's not a qui.

2495
03:01:05,400 --> 03:01:06,400
It's not a bon qui qui.

2496
03:01:06,400 --> 03:01:07,400
It's not what that is,

2497
03:01:07,400 --> 03:01:10,400
because that's when air comes out of your qui qui, you know?

2498
03:01:11,400 --> 03:01:12,400
But it takes a...

2499
03:01:12,400 --> 03:01:13,400
You thought that was a myth?

2500
03:01:13,400 --> 03:01:14,400
No!

2501
03:01:14,400 --> 03:01:16,400
It's just like the way that you sit and the pressure,

2502
03:01:19,400 --> 03:01:20,400
it'll just go to the front.

2503
03:01:22,400 --> 03:01:23,400
It'll still come out of the back,

2504
03:01:23,400 --> 03:01:24,400
it'll go to the front.

2505
03:01:24,400 --> 03:01:25,400
It's like wings flapping.

2506
03:01:25,400 --> 03:01:26,400
Yeah.

2507
03:01:28,400 --> 03:01:29,400
It's literally what it sounds like,

2508
03:01:29,400 --> 03:01:30,400
except fart version.

2509
03:01:32,400 --> 03:01:33,400
I'm not here for quiffanonic.

2510
03:01:34,400 --> 03:01:35,400
You're not?

2511
03:01:39,400 --> 03:01:40,400
Oh, that's real too,

2512
03:01:40,400 --> 03:01:41,400
because you can just get air up there.

2513
03:01:44,400 --> 03:01:45,400
Especially

2514
03:01:47,400 --> 03:01:49,400
if you're like hanging out,

2515
03:01:49,400 --> 03:01:51,400
playing with your Barbie dolls,

2516
03:01:52,400 --> 03:01:54,400
and a Barbie doll is like really big.

2517
03:01:55,400 --> 03:01:56,400
Excuse me.

2518
03:01:56,400 --> 03:01:57,400
It can push air.

2519
03:02:00,400 --> 03:02:02,400
And then it will say in a Barbie voice,

2520
03:02:03,400 --> 03:02:04,400
qui!

2521
03:02:04,400 --> 03:02:05,400
And then you're like, whoa!

2522
03:02:06,400 --> 03:02:07,400
Didn't expect that.

2523
03:02:11,400 --> 03:02:12,400
It comes out of the back,

2524
03:02:12,400 --> 03:02:13,400
travels across the chair

2525
03:02:13,400 --> 03:02:16,400
and flaps the front on the left eye.

2526
03:02:18,400 --> 03:02:19,400
And we were about to hear it.

2527
03:02:19,400 --> 03:02:20,400
I'm also because I'm sweating.

2528
03:02:20,400 --> 03:02:22,400
My apartment's so hot right now.

2529
03:02:24,400 --> 03:02:25,400
She's a woman of elegance.

2530
03:02:28,400 --> 03:02:29,400
There's a lot of many talents.

2531
03:02:30,400 --> 03:02:32,400
I can be very elegant and proper.

2532
03:02:33,400 --> 03:02:36,400
I can be so proper and motherly,

2533
03:02:36,400 --> 03:02:38,400
and I don't know what you're talking about.

2534
03:02:39,400 --> 03:02:41,400
I gotta put on my Patreon voice for this,

2535
03:02:41,400 --> 03:02:44,400
because I can't believe that you,

2536
03:02:44,400 --> 03:02:45,400
out of all people,

2537
03:02:45,400 --> 03:02:48,400
wouldn't think that I am not the most elegant woman

2538
03:02:49,400 --> 03:02:50,400
in all of the land.

2539
03:02:54,400 --> 03:02:55,400
Bye-bye!

2540
03:02:56,400 --> 03:02:57,400
Have a good night,

2541
03:02:57,400 --> 03:02:58,400
or day, or evening,

2542
03:02:58,400 --> 03:02:59,400
lunch or dinner or whatever.

2543
03:03:00,400 --> 03:03:01,400
I got a pee.

2544
03:03:03,400 --> 03:03:04,400
Motherly.

2545
03:03:04,400 --> 03:03:05,400
Yeah, go do your homework.

2546
03:03:06,400 --> 03:03:07,400
What are these grades?

2547
03:03:07,400 --> 03:03:08,400
Get your GPA up, bro.

2548
03:03:08,400 --> 03:03:09,400
You kidding me?

2549
03:03:12,400 --> 03:03:13,400
Okay, for that voice too.

2550
03:03:13,400 --> 03:03:14,400
Oh yeah!

2551
03:03:14,400 --> 03:03:15,400
Shameless plan!

2552
03:03:15,400 --> 03:03:16,400
Please look in the description below

2553
03:03:16,400 --> 03:03:17,400
and check out my Patreon,

2554
03:03:17,400 --> 03:03:21,400
and check out my, um,

2555
03:03:21,400 --> 03:03:22,400
merch!

2556
03:03:23,400 --> 03:03:24,400
I'm like, what the fuck do I have again?

2557
03:03:24,400 --> 03:03:25,400
I don't know.

2558
03:03:28,400 --> 03:03:29,400
Yep, checked it out.

2559
03:03:32,400 --> 03:03:33,400
Hey!

2560
03:03:33,400 --> 03:03:34,400
Imagine if it's done like that all the time,

2561
03:03:34,400 --> 03:03:35,400
like, what's up guys?

2562
03:03:35,400 --> 03:03:37,400
Hey, welcome to the stream.

2563
03:03:37,400 --> 03:03:39,400
It's me, Sheena Gumball.

2564
03:03:41,400 --> 03:03:44,400
New audios on Patreon every Thursday!

2565
03:03:45,400 --> 03:03:47,400
Oh, is your GPA?

2566
03:03:49,400 --> 03:03:50,400
Actually, in college,

2567
03:03:50,400 --> 03:03:52,400
I had a perfect GPA,

2568
03:03:52,400 --> 03:03:54,400
but then I dropped out to be a streamer.

2569
03:03:55,400 --> 03:03:56,400
No, I didn't drop out to be a streamer.

2570
03:03:56,400 --> 03:03:57,400
I was just like,

2571
03:03:57,400 --> 03:03:58,400
between working full-time

2572
03:03:58,400 --> 03:03:59,400

2573
03:03:59,400 --> 03:04:00,400

2574
03:04:00,400 --> 03:04:02,400

2576

2578
03:04:05,400 --> 03:04:07,400

2579
03:04:07,400 --> 03:04:08,400
at age of 56.

2580
03:04:08,400 --> 03:04:09,400
I have plenty of time.

2581
03:04:10,400 --> 03:04:12,400

2584
03:04:19,400 --> 03:04:20,400
But in high school,

2585
03:04:20,400 --> 03:04:21,400
I think it was like a 3.0

2586
03:04:21,400 --> 03:04:22,400
because I didn't really care.

2587
03:04:25,400 --> 03:04:26,400

03:04:26,400 --> 03:04:27,400
bimbofication.

2589
03:04:27,400 --> 03:04:28,400

2728
03:18:09,320 --> 03:18:16,360
comment i was like huh what's a hand dimple what the fuck is a hand i'm like looking at my hands

2729
03:18:16,360 --> 03:18:21,160
right now i have like i definitely have like a what's it called

2730
03:18:21,160 --> 03:18:24,760
um

2731
03:18:27,800 --> 03:18:35,160
it's fucking like what the fuck is it handbrows tweaking i don't even know there's a type of

2732
03:18:41,560 --> 03:18:47,480
oh i definitely have like a gangly insist because of my fucked up joints i wish i could

2733
03:18:48,280 --> 03:18:52,920
i've slammed a bible on it before and it exploded and it was great and then i

2734
03:18:52,920 --> 03:18:57,560
didn't have wrist pain for a while i need to do it again because you have to like go and like have your hand

2735
03:18:58,120 --> 03:19:09,800
like whatever like i don't i hate your knuckles hand dimples this is my knuckles um i don't

2736
03:19:09,800 --> 03:19:15,080
like scars on my body because i get scarred very easily by doing like i still have a fucking

2737
03:19:15,080 --> 03:19:21,720
bruise the bruise left a scar that i had i now have a faint brown mark on where i actually must

2738
03:19:21,720 --> 03:19:28,200
have accidentally hit my hand my wrist it is dumb bible thumb for heebie like gang or system he's a blood

2739
03:19:29,000 --> 03:19:31,720
actually i have no idea but well yeah i'm wearing red so that makes sense

2740
03:19:34,200 --> 03:19:42,680
i'm brown i can say it leave me alone um but hitting them with the word uh yes the word of the lord

2741
03:19:42,680 --> 03:19:48,280
makes them go away um but lance uh not even lance you can't even lance you literally have to cut it

2742
03:19:48,280 --> 03:19:57,080
out because what it is it's your joint fluid uh decides to go out of your bone or whatever the

2743
03:19:57,080 --> 03:20:01,960
fuck your joints and then it makes a little pocket and sometimes you can pop it and your body

2744
03:20:01,960 --> 03:20:09,480
will reabsorb it but you have to take out the sack so that it stops growing back um ten

2745
03:20:13,080 --> 03:20:21,720
i've actually taken a needle before uh like should i be saying this that sounds fucked up

2746
03:20:21,720 --> 03:20:29,400
uh i've taken i'm not i've taken a needle before and um i've drawn out some of the liquid

2747
03:20:30,600 --> 03:20:35,400
and it's it's pure clear it literally looks like jelly like clear jelly and it was so weird

2748
03:20:35,400 --> 03:20:39,560
but it was great because then it went down because i drew and um my mom was like why did you

2749
03:20:39,560 --> 03:20:45,080
do that and i'm like because i i'm a doctor she's like no you're not and i'm like well i

2755
03:21:15,960 --> 03:21:22,520
mass murderer or something i just like seeing how things work that's how what i'll say

2804
03:27:29,400 --> 03:27:34,040
it's almost like a therapy tool because like let's say you're like what do i need to work on

2806
03:27:40,600 --> 03:27:46,520
touch with uh his emotions and then you're like maybe i need to be more mindful about my emotions

2807
03:27:46,520 --> 03:27:52,200
this week you don't even have to think of it of like oh go sir fucking talking to me it's just i like

2808
03:27:52,200 --> 03:28:00,280
to put it like that that's how i frame it not like spirits from the other world they're speaking to me

2809
03:28:00,280 --> 03:28:06,440
although i have done i did do uh the carot caro cards yes the carrot cards i have done like spell

2810
03:28:06,440 --> 03:28:13,800
jarwork um that was fun i think there's like a short of me as rena where i talked about how you

2811
03:28:13,800 --> 03:28:23,400
can abort a baby with mugwort that was cool um i literally have all like my altars above my desk

2812
03:28:23,400 --> 03:28:31,800
and all that shit but you know i don't expect people to like like that stuff you don't have to i just do

2813
03:28:32,680 --> 03:28:36,760
as you can i don't talk about it on stream a lot because i don't make it a part of my

2814
03:28:36,760 --> 03:28:42,040
personality but i will rub rose quartz on you because you need self-love homeboy i'm kidding

2815
03:28:42,040 --> 03:28:47,800
it's fine tarot cards are just fun i have a few decks myself exactly yeah huh

2816
03:28:50,280 --> 03:28:55,880
uh i have two tarot cards that's very accurate i've been told my readings are very accurate i used

2817
03:28:55,880 --> 03:29:00,920
to do it for my previous viewers they loved it a lot uh they in fact scolded me when i because i

2818
03:29:00,920 --> 03:29:04,840
usually you would do it every sunday the day of the lord and when i didn't do it on sunday they were mad

2819
03:29:09,400 --> 03:29:14,280
i actually haven't done any of like like actually practice in a very long time like i'll leave out

2820
03:29:14,280 --> 03:29:22,600
like an offering like and thanks and stuff um for like progress i've made um it's just like it's just

2821
03:29:22,600 --> 03:29:28,440
like the equivalent of like okay you pray to your god or your ancestors or what have you

2822
03:29:28,440 --> 03:29:35,240
you know everybody's entitled to their belief system i'm a cancer yeah to society i'm kidding

2823
03:29:37,560 --> 03:29:46,120
kind of the moon stone so i can snort it baby girl um shibism yes exactly my dm uses tarot

2824
03:29:46,120 --> 03:29:51,160
cards i've heard that people will sometimes use tarot and dnd games and i think that's very clever

2825
03:29:52,360 --> 03:29:56,440
charger terry why are you guys randomly telling me your zodiac signs are you what do you want me

2826
03:29:56,440 --> 03:30:01,640
to do with that information i don't i'm not like i don't like read your birth chart

2827
03:30:03,800 --> 03:30:12,040
vergo over here okay everybody's just shouting out i'm a libra libras are very sensual did you know that

2828
03:30:12,040 --> 03:30:26,680
torus gang oh you like money don't you little grubby money for um scorpio i'm such a scorpio girl

2829
03:30:26,680 --> 03:30:29,720
it's funny because like half of you are probably lying so i'm like i'm not gonna

2830
03:30:31,560 --> 03:30:38,840
find about tarot from cyberpunk oh yeah true i didn't think it's super through super well is that

2831
03:30:38,840 --> 03:30:45,000
the sedutarius thing oh sedutarius is are very known to kind of be their fire sign so they're

2832
03:30:45,000 --> 03:30:51,560
can be like impulsive and they prefer to like act just like aries actually um instead of like think

2833
03:30:51,560 --> 03:30:59,720
they're also like boys on the move so my dad is an aries and my mom is a capricorn

2834
03:30:59,720 --> 03:31:08,200
hard-working bitch my mom is lover for that yeah i got a ht that checks but like people

2835
03:31:08,200 --> 03:31:13,880
are saying like oh i'm a sedutarius and then they won't identify with any traits of a sedutarius

2836
03:31:13,880 --> 03:31:19,960
and that's because there are other things that have to do with your birth chart or whatever

2837
03:31:19,960 --> 03:31:27,560
i don't read birth charts i don't have knowledge of that um but apparently you are more than just your

2838
03:31:27,560 --> 03:31:33,000
your sun sign bergo is an honest sign i don't mind about it

2839
03:31:35,320 --> 03:31:39,960
there also one of my one of my olive is a is overgo she's very ocd but she's not she

2840
03:31:39,960 --> 03:31:43,480
doesn't have ocd but she's very like it has to be just like this

2841
03:31:45,080 --> 03:31:51,800
Pisces don't be fishy uh the one pisces my my best friend growing up was a pisces

2843
03:31:56,760 --> 03:31:58,440
as they are described

2844
03:32:00,920 --> 03:32:06,440
yeah tracks for bergo i never lie about being a scorpio because that's the only one i know

2845

2881
03:35:49,080 --> 03:35:55,080
it was so funny oh my god it was so funny it was so funny oh yeah they're not i don't i don't see

2882
03:35:55,080 --> 03:36:02,360
them as co-workers they're my sisters they're my sisters they are my sisters and strani is mommy

2883
03:36:02,360 --> 03:36:07,080
honestly though it's funny because people like i've been asked by like other people from other

2884
03:36:07,080 --> 03:36:13,160
corpos or like um my indie friends and they're like oh what's it like with your boss being your

2885
03:36:13,160 --> 03:36:19,160
gen mate i'm like to be honest with you she doesn't really feel like my boss she's just my friend um

2886
03:36:19,160 --> 03:36:26,520
and she kind of still falls under that sister category i don't really see her as a boss and

2887
03:36:26,520 --> 03:36:31,160
that's what she wants but like obviously obviously i still respect her when she's like hey guys

2888
03:36:31,160 --> 03:36:38,200
we need to work on this or do you mind uh doing this uh or like here's some critique for your

2889
03:36:38,920 --> 03:36:44,920
or like here's some critique for your last audio like um i will respect and respond

2890
03:36:44,920 --> 03:36:51,720
to her but i'll do that for everyone as well um but it's it's it's it's nice because like i don't

2891
03:36:53,320 --> 03:37:00,280
feel like well that's not it sounds bad when i say it aloud like i don't feel like i have a boss

2892
03:37:00,280 --> 03:37:06,760
but like i do obviously but it's like like it's just a nice work environment you know sisters

2893
03:37:06,760 --> 03:37:13,880
benefits indeed your anime girl we're kind of like you not you guys i'm at the other i'm at the

2894
03:37:13,880 --> 03:37:23,480
other my gen mates i don't care what you guys think you kidding me right meow i guess strani is more

2895
03:37:23,480 --> 03:37:32,200
of a leader for lack of better terms but to be honest i would not we're all on pretty level

2896
03:37:32,200 --> 03:37:35,640
ground because like strani will come to me and be like hey what do you think about this and i'm

2897
03:37:35,640 --> 03:37:39,640
like oh he's my opinion and i'm like oh you should ask the other girls she's like you know what i will

2898
03:37:39,640 --> 03:37:48,120
because like uh you guys forget strani has been a vtuber less for the majority of us so sometimes

2899
03:37:48,120 --> 03:37:54,680
she'll ask us questions which is honestly and the thing like what a boss should do is like when they

2900
03:37:54,680 --> 03:37:59,400
don't know something be able to talk to their staff and be like hey uh i need your help with this and

2901
03:37:59,400 --> 03:38:04,760
she's asked me that um and i know she's probably done that for the other girls too like i know she's

2902
03:38:04,760 --> 03:38:12,360
probably because emi has some rigging stuff so she's probably um we were having issues at one point

2903
03:38:12,360 --> 03:38:18,840
but it was it wasn't at any fault of our rigor it was literally just um us not knowing how to set up

2904
03:38:18,840 --> 03:38:27,400
stuff in vtuber studio properly um we were all struggling to like fix our mouth tracking uh for

2905
03:38:27,400 --> 03:38:31,720
some reason because like the sensitivity was like low or whatever but it was just it was just like

2906
03:38:31,800 --> 03:38:36,040
vtuber studio being stupid and emi was like oh this this is that and then strani was like yay

2907
03:38:38,280 --> 03:38:43,880
so um but yeah these aren't supposed to be all no yeah like leader a leader is someone who knows

2908
03:38:43,880 --> 03:38:50,760
when to ask for help um knows what everybody's strengths and weaknesses are and make sure everybody

2909
03:38:50,760 --> 03:38:57,320
is supported um but yeah actually then yes strani is a great leader 100 but she doesn't

2910
03:38:57,320 --> 03:39:02,120
she's not like i'm what i'm what i mean to say she doesn't come off like i am a top

2911
03:39:02,120 --> 03:39:08,200
sorry i'm the top bitch in this this corpo i can't i can't even do with a the accent

2912
03:39:08,200 --> 03:39:10,760
but i need a toot

2913
03:39:21,080 --> 03:39:27,000
um upwards management collaboration yeah it's just it's just collaboration

2914
03:39:27,960 --> 03:39:30,760
guys don't deserve the two you got one free two you don't get anymore

2915
03:39:31,080 --> 03:39:39,480
listen first and act second yeah exactly because like strani's been on me she's like oh you

2916
03:39:39,480 --> 03:39:46,040
know what should we work on for july and i'm like um i don't know you tell me

2917
03:39:47,880 --> 03:39:51,880
but she's but she's like she asked for feedback and she's so receptive because she wants to make

2918
03:39:51,880 --> 03:39:59,720
sure everybody's doing okay he's very good he's not mean about anything um i appreciate her a lot

2919
03:39:59,720 --> 03:40:03,800
because i like i'm that's why i'm like i don't think i could see myself another company if they

2920
03:40:03,800 --> 03:40:10,200
didn't treat me like this like if if like five years from now i'm still a vtuber but violer has

2921
03:40:10,200 --> 03:40:15,960
ceased operations god forbid and i get picked up by another corpo if they ain't like strani then

2922
03:40:15,960 --> 03:40:24,040
i don't want it i wait the day she be masters of strani impersonation that would be terrifying

2923
03:40:25,000 --> 03:40:29,400
uh if only i could be like elizabeth row's blood flame and just literally mimic

2924
03:40:29,400 --> 03:40:33,000
people's voices perfectly oh i wish i had that superpower

2925
03:40:36,520 --> 03:40:45,000
yeah i definitely won't find a corpo like this um but like i in terms of management yes we're

2926
03:40:45,000 --> 03:40:49,960
different in terms of like transparency with like our split and stuff yes we're different

2927
03:40:49,960 --> 03:40:57,000
but honestly from like we're not different from other corpos that much minus the patreon

2928
03:40:57,000 --> 03:41:02,760
audios i'll be honest with you like yeah but if you're elizabeth you'll be british

2929
03:41:04,200 --> 03:41:11,480
i like british accents but i see the i see the quandary there yeah her her kiara impression

2930
03:41:11,480 --> 03:41:15,400
and her mori impression were really good but speaking of why do people think do people really

2931
03:41:15,400 --> 03:41:23,880
think i sound like mori like i don't i don't think i sound like mori but that's that's very good uh

2932
03:41:23,880 --> 03:41:28,280
that's a very good honor collab with mori rap rapping with mori just kidding hollow live fans would

2933
03:41:28,280 --> 03:41:35,160
actually murder me they're like whore kill her burn her at the stake i don't think you do oh i think

2934
03:41:35,160 --> 03:41:40,440
maybe it was in my debut because some people uh said that i sound like mori and like left comments

2935
03:41:40,440 --> 03:41:47,480
about it moro vibe i got a more i got the mori vibe the mori calliope vibe that's an honor thank you

2936
03:41:48,440 --> 03:41:52,440
i think it's a transparency that gives perception of you are being vividly wildly different yeah

2937
03:41:52,440 --> 03:42:01,480
you know like a lot of people um still like shit honest and stuff because apparently um so people

2938
03:42:03,000 --> 03:42:09,720
it was brought to my attention by one of my gen mates that my me quitting my job had made its

2939
03:42:09,720 --> 03:42:15,400
way to reddit and reddit people were not happy that i quit my job to be a vtuber that she's like

2940
03:42:15,400 --> 03:42:22,760
she's never gonna make it asmr is going down the drain blah blah blah blah and i i shout out to the

2941
03:42:22,760 --> 03:42:27,960
like two people in the fed we're like she was already planning on doing this she's getting a

2942
03:42:27,960 --> 03:42:33,320
different part-time job and her other job is scoring her over there's more to this than just

2943
03:42:33,320 --> 03:42:41,080
she's quitting her job wait for real yeah oh yeah yeah but i was just like

2944
03:42:43,080 --> 03:42:51,160
i realized in like normal like normie places like a lot of people really think that we're

2945
03:42:51,960 --> 03:42:56,840
gonna be like so shitty or like we're gonna be doing terrible things in our streams and just

2946
03:42:56,840 --> 03:43:01,400
makes me laugh so hard because we are the most normal people like yes i'll make some like off-color

2947
03:43:01,400 --> 03:43:06,520
jokes and i'll make like make some like preferred jokes but you'll see there's some vtubers that get

2948
03:43:06,520 --> 03:43:16,040
away with way more than i do like to be honest even the garthik phone stream 100 i bet like if if we

2949
03:43:16,040 --> 03:43:25,880
wanted to we could definitely like tamper ourselves a little bit to be like another corpo like like

2950
03:43:25,880 --> 03:43:33,080
like look at idle like we're we're just similar except not cony we see the quiet part out loud that's

2951
03:43:33,080 --> 03:43:39,480
literally what i say i'm like we just actually advertise our stuff we're also yeah we have a

2952
03:43:39,480 --> 03:43:44,680
relay back i agree mrs boris don't put by much contact yeah that's true

2953
03:43:48,280 --> 03:43:52,200
low key when i go back to school and i graduate want to do what you did and quit my job and

2954
03:43:52,200 --> 03:43:59,000
fucking ball that's fucking ball um good luck with that bro i i really hope that works out for

2955
03:43:59,000 --> 03:44:05,960
you quitting your jobs hard like um i have been looking uh the job stuff sucks like i said i had

2956
03:44:05,960 --> 03:44:16,040
savings but hopefully hopefully you know um hopefully that i can just live off a dealer

2957
03:44:16,040 --> 03:44:22,520
we'll see because again that's up up to you guys and i don't want to pressure you to be like

2958
03:44:23,160 --> 03:44:26,600
i need to live give me your money that you need to live

2959
03:44:29,160 --> 03:44:32,680

2960
03:44:32,680 --> 03:44:37,720
lean into our cafe and like do the fantasy that everybody wants but you know i'm just chilling

2961

2962
03:44:43,880 --> 03:44:52,680

2965
03:45:07,960 --> 03:45:11,960
on everybody's fan bases and be like oh what's what people say

2966
03:45:14,040 --> 03:45:18,040

2968
03:45:29,160 --> 03:45:37,000

2969
03:45:37,000 --> 03:45:40,440
watching other people or oh she marks because i'm just like you know i'm trying to make a

2970

connection i'm trying to network and all that stuff um uh and so i'll creep on you guys and i'm like

2971
03:45:47,000 --> 03:45:54,680
oh you guys are sweet oh you guys are nice um i especially like there's a certain type of love

2972
03:45:54,680 --> 03:45:59,960
and affection that everybody's fan base has for them for their respective talents and it just

2973
03:45:59,960 --> 03:46:04,120
generally makes me so happy to see you know there's always like a couple of ones that are like

2974
03:46:04,760 --> 03:46:11,400
when's your period did you wake up but like that's that's that's in every every fan base

2976
03:46:21,720 --> 03:46:27,240
and my my fan base i realize i think they control themselves they're like they hold back

2977
03:46:27,480 --> 03:46:35,320
and i think that's sweet i feel like they're i feel like thank you black silence

2978

2982
03:47:12,600 --> 03:47:19,400
back yeah it's it's it's so interesting how the dynamics um and i'm like maybe it's because like

2983
03:47:19,400 --> 03:47:27,240
i'm a little reserved as well like i don't maybe i don't do as much um and also just how my how i am

2984
03:47:27,240 --> 03:47:28,280
i'm i'm very

2985
03:47:34,200 --> 03:47:40,360
there's a lot of trust that has to be built you know um so i know like i'm slowly opening up

2986
03:47:40,360 --> 03:47:47,960
like yes i've done like fun things now and then on my all but like i haven't shown my true power level

2987
03:47:50,360 --> 03:47:59,480
um but ew brother ew fandom ew um fans reflect the streamer so i'm like okay i fans reflect the streamer

2988
03:48:00,760 --> 03:48:06,440
is it because i'm reserved but i what i was gonna say i'm like i feel like i'm like the girl at school

2989
03:48:07,320 --> 03:48:10,840
that you think is really pretty and cute and you just don't know how to talk to her

2990
03:48:12,200 --> 03:48:17,160
and you're like i want you to step on me i just i really want to tell her that

2991
03:48:17,240 --> 03:48:24,760
anonymous tipped four dollars and 20 cents so i heard supers and tips are free oh my god thank you

2992
03:48:28,520 --> 03:48:33,960
um yeah it's only been three weeks it's crazy and yeah and it's like we'll grow like i i'm probably

2993
03:48:33,960 --> 03:48:38,440
going to be you know a different streamer in the future because i'm going to be learning more things

2994
03:48:38,440 --> 03:48:45,320
i'm gonna kind of become uncomfortable with each other um but not even just like i i know i don't

2995
03:48:45,320 --> 03:48:52,360
have as have as much as a ravenous fan base or rabid fan base as uh some of the other girls

2996
03:48:53,000 --> 03:48:58,040
um and honestly like that's okay because i think we're all unique we all attract a different

2997
03:48:58,920 --> 03:49:08,040
group of people i love the sweet devotion of reeflings i love the absolute care that dadas have for

2998
03:49:08,040 --> 03:49:15,400
i see i love the worshiping aura that bleeding hearts that the blacks have the black bros have

2999
03:49:15,400 --> 03:49:29,400

your bible i hope uh whatever hand you like to turn the pages with i hope you're reading your

3055
03:56:06,440 --> 03:56:14,440
bible really study your verses i want you to really focus on that scripture that you're reading

3056
03:56:14,440 --> 03:56:22,840
right now the very top of the scripture that i want you to slowly read the scripture down

3057
03:56:26,120 --> 03:56:30,040
and then i want you to repeat the process for other scriptures linger

3058
03:56:31,000 --> 03:56:34,600
at the beginning of the words in the scripture and then slowly

3059
03:56:35,640 --> 03:56:43,640
read the final words really meditate on the word okay you love bible study oh i love bible study i

3060
03:56:43,640 --> 03:56:45,800
bible study i did up my bible study before

3061
03:56:51,400 --> 03:56:52,040
what was that

3062
03:56:55,800 --> 03:57:04,600
jesus took the strap verses we know i don't um yeah i was reading i was watching

3063
03:57:05,640 --> 03:57:09,640
it's really meditating on scripture it took longer for me to finish the passage than i

3064
03:57:10,440 --> 03:57:13,720
anticipated none outfit when

3065
03:57:15,640 --> 03:57:17,480
goth none hi reina

3066
03:57:20,440 --> 03:57:21,400
i burp on you reina

3067
03:57:25,640 --> 03:57:29,160
why is your chest wet were you just drinking water and just stuck your body in it

3068
03:57:33,560 --> 03:57:38,280
five minute bible study yeah usually it's i do a quick bible study um but that one was like a

3069
03:57:38,280 --> 03:57:45,400
20 minute bible study i don't it was really hard my favorite verse um

3070
03:57:48,760 --> 03:57:55,160
if your eye is harming you tear it from your head and cast it away

3071
03:57:59,400 --> 03:58:04,600
and if you have a rafter in your own eye do not point out the rafter in your brother's

3072
03:58:05,400 --> 03:58:07,640
for you must remove your own raptor yourself

3073
03:58:14,520 --> 03:58:16,760
yeah and that's actual scripture um by the way

3074
03:58:19,560 --> 03:58:22,520
and the name of the bible writer of the holy spirit amen

3075
03:58:23,960 --> 03:58:26,520
ah yes luke 623 is that luke 623

3076
03:58:28,440 --> 03:58:32,840
proverb maybe i think it is a proverb i can't remember remember the bible it was so long

3077
03:58:33,560 --> 03:58:38,360
you got something in your eye what the what it means i don't get my eye till i

3078
03:58:39,240 --> 03:58:44,360
what it means is you can't point out bad shit the other people have done when you have done

3079
03:58:44,360 --> 03:58:48,200
your own bad shit you got to work on yourself before you could be like oh you did this shit

3080
03:58:50,040 --> 03:58:54,920
i think reina did she tear up the eyes of your no no no it wasn't tear the eye of your enemy

3081
03:58:55,480 --> 03:59:01,080
well again there's different translations because you have like the king's james translation you have like

3082
03:59:03,800 --> 03:59:05,800
i can only think of the king's james one right now

3083
03:59:10,120 --> 03:59:16,440
but yes uh very much i hope you're meditating on your scripture um i should put a non-outfit on throne

3084
03:59:19,880 --> 03:59:27,000
people ask like oh how do i count oh no my question is how do i how am i supposed to count

3085
03:59:28,120 --> 03:59:31,720
down through certain scriptures like that's what i'm wondering about

3086
03:59:33,800 --> 03:59:40,920
how do i do that like oh okay first verse second verse third verse

3087
03:59:41,560 --> 03:59:46,600
be a fan of the older new testament i'm an old testament i like uh i like old testament god

3088
03:59:46,600 --> 03:59:50,440
because he was just like a dick and wanted to kill everybody you know my favorite conspiracy

3089
03:59:50,440 --> 03:59:55,400
theory about the bible is that they're two separate gods because the old testament god and the new

3090
03:59:55,400 --> 04:00:01,720
testament god are very very different in how they act towards humans all testament gods like i'm

3091
04:00:01,720 --> 04:00:07,000
gonna smite everyone and the new testament god's like oh i love you all oh you're so sweet here's my

3092
04:00:07,000 --> 04:00:15,240
son i'm sending my son he's gonna die for your son uh i just like how badass old testament god was

3093
04:00:15,240 --> 04:00:18,760
although book of revelation is trippy as hell i'll tell you that much

3094
04:00:21,720 --> 04:00:26,520
let's say start at 10 first 10 and go backwards oh i like that i like that

3095
04:00:27,240 --> 04:00:38,040
i want you to read luke chapter six verse 10 and then i want you to read

3096
04:00:40,360 --> 04:00:43,640
luke chapter six verse nine

3097
04:00:46,760 --> 04:00:50,360
and then i really want you to think about eight

3098
04:00:56,840 --> 04:01:02,760
are you thinking hard about eight

3099
04:01:05,560 --> 04:01:10,520
