I might need to- I think I need to have an idle meeting when I'm not sure yet. But how are you guys doing? I'm doing fine. I hope you're doing fine. I could have slept a little longer, but it's kind of better I don't, because, oh my god, I'm so big at the hell I'm trying to scroll, so that, um, I'm echoing, I hate it when I do that. Um, so that, oh, it's my turn to putt. That should have been a warning sign. Oh yeah, so I have to wear this on me because YouTube doesn't like my bosom, so I'm hiding it. Out of shame, I'm so shameful. I'm so terrible for YouTube. Um, I am getting a cover-up, uh, eventually, so. And it'll probably just be my shirt button, which is nice. I might have got my nose itches. YouTube does pick and choose, yes. Um, let me see. Literally one of my favorite games of all time, plus she be streaming it. I'm being good today. Um, I love Inscription. Inscription is one of my favorite games of all time, so I know some of you guys have that in common. It is, if you don't know what Inscription is, Inscription is a, um, it's a card, turn-based card game, and cards have unique properties. You do all very interesting characters that have very cool little perks that they got. The ambiance is amazing, the plot is amazing, it's very meta. I highly recommend, if you've never played Inscription after, um, watching me today, please play it. It's such a good game. I've played through the game multiple times. Some of you who might be from, um, my PL have seen me play it before, and my Inscription streams where I know some of people's favorites, because I gave everybody very funny voices. But yeah, it's a very, very good, uh, good game. We're going to be doing Casey's Mod, so a Casey's Mod is that it extends the first portion of the game, because there's several sections of the game. There's different phases, um, and because, of course, it's the one you first start off with, the first phase of the game, or the first half, or whatever portion, um, is a fan favorite of everybody's, um, for the graphics, the characters, what have you. So Casey's Mod expands that, so it lasts a little bit longer. We have Crowd Control, I'm going to, I don't, I don't know how it will work with Inscription, but we'll see. I'm very excited. I've never played it with the Crowd Control with Inscription before, so that'll be fun. Um, somebody also asked, uh, if I'm replacing Strani and the, uh, Uno collab tomorrow, uh, or, sorry, the day after, or Sunday, I can't remember, I just woke up, let me alone. Um, yes, I am, because I was supposed to be in it in the first place. Uh, she only subbed in for me, because I couldn't join because of work. But now, since I quit my job, I can be back in it. So I apologize if that disappoints you, I completely understand if it does. Um, but, yeah, I still hope you think we'll have fun, because I know we will. Um, yeah, it's no work now, yay. Saturday, yes. Um, yeah, it's stupid, Uno only has four players, like it's so dumb, it should be like six or eight, like at max in my opinion, but you know, it is what it is, you know, it's owned by Ubisoft, so what the fuck, whatever. Um, hold on, Uno reverse card. Uh, the graphic, the thumbnail artist, I was like, I realized after they're like, oh, what do you want me to put on your thumbnail? And I'm like, so, and they show me examples of like, Shawnee's, and it was like, um, stop saying you're inking yourself for five minutes or draw 25. So, uh, I did stop doing wacky voices for five minutes, but what I should have done was stop getting demonetized for five minutes or draw 25. And I thought would have been funner. Um, but it is what it is. It's still, it's still silly. Although like, it was funny that the Azura, the collab I have with Azura, it did get limited ads, which I thought was really funny. I don't, I seem to have fallen asleep in excitement. Well, I'll just talk like this, I guess. Um, it might be my wifi. It's, it's been like really hot today. I wouldn't be surprised if like, I don't know, freaking fire happens or lose power or what have you. It's just, it's, it's the hottest it's been. It's been a long time in my area. Um, but, uh, I did get limited ads, but I appealed it and they accepted it. It's fine. So it's good. It's fine. Oh, I've woken up. Um, I, I literally was so tired after, hold on. Where did my BGM go for just chatting? Hello? That's so weird. I should have it here instead of me just like talking incessantly. I'll have you have some music with it. Um, there we go. That's fine. Cool beans. Um, what was I going to say? Oh, uh, so I went into the grocery store. I haven't been in the grocery store and ground grocery shopping and like maybe a month or two. I usually, like, I don't really eat a lot. I like, you guys, like I'll usually just like door dash a meal and that's my thing for the day, which I'm like, that's probably not healthy. Just eating one meal a day. Hey, but I have like apple juice and water. So I got some snacks. I was really pissed though, because I, I'm like, I said, I mentioned like power going out and stuff on just because in the, um, the frozen food section of my supermarket, the power was out. So all, I feel bad for the supermarket. So they're like, you can't open the doors. I'm like, then why even have this place open if we can't open any of the fast, not the fast food, the frozen food section. And like, I was going to get a pizza and or like some like salmon because I love salmon and I couldn't even do that. So I literally just got like snacks. I have, I have, um, Emmy, Mammy, want beef, uh, beef jerky. So I got beef jerky next to me. I've already eaten half of a bueno and I have an airhead next to me and I'm like, I literally went food shopping. Like I'm a fucking teenager. But, um, yeah, I have to like actually, I'll probably go to another supermarket tomorrow and like get like, um, usually I'll get like steak or like some sort of unlike some poultry. Um, I do, I do, I did see my little, it's funny because people are like, oh, oh, should you be, you put, you added hello fresh on your alt account. Oh, did you know you were doing? Yes, I did. That was the point. It was, it was funny because I knew I would get interaction. You guys have been tricked. And also, um, I tweeted from that account because I thought it would get more attention because it has more followers than my main. But then I was just like, wait, I don't want them to think I'm just a whore because I'm more than that. I'm more than just a whore, okay. Um, so I, that's when I added, I was like, uh, oh shit, add this. But yeah, you guys can believe the other thing that I did it on accident. That's okay. Don't be mad. You got baited. I sound like I'm drunk. I sound like a girl at a party that's like, hey, do you want to come home with me? Like my ride kind of ditched me. So like, can you take me home? No, I've only had like a couple shots. It's not a big deal. I'm not going to puke in your car. Just take me home. All right. All right. Thank you. Um, I'm such a kidder. Yeah. Fresh. She'd be banned. Um, I wonder if one fourth of your grocery bills is actual hood. Like, yeah, I got like some Cheerios. I got milk. I got like way too much juice, I will say. I'm like, I got like two, two different types of seltzer. I got some ginger ale because my tummy has been upset. I don't drink soda often. I'm like, you know, I'll make up, I'll make an exception with ginger ale. That's better. Right. Um, it's not. And then I got some, I realized they got two types of apple juice. I got apple juice in a pouch. And then I got apple juice in the, like in the giant container of apple juice, like a jug of apple juice. And I was like, well, I thought I grabbed the peach tea, but I grabbed the apple juice. So I guess I have one apple juice. And then I got lemonade. Did I grab lemonade? I don't know. And I realized I got milk when I already had milk. And I'm like, you know, you can never get too much milk. I don't drink milk because like just like a zero, I'm lactose intolerant. And I really shouldn't be having milk or gluten for that matter because, uh, fiber actually, um, dairy and gluten cause inflammation if you didn't know that. So if you're having inflammation problems, don't eat that stuff. But, um, I don't live in California where everybody and their mom is like vegetarian and gluten free or whatever have you. So I will eat it anyways at the expense of my physical health. And also because it tastes good. No one can stop me. Uh, lactose free. There was like, honestly, when things say that they're lactose free, I don't really believe it cause like I'll drink lactate. I'll still have tummy issues. I don't know what it is. There's this other drink. There's this other type of milk I got that's lactose free. I still get tummy issues. So maybe it's another thing within the milk that makes me sick. I don't know. It really just makes me fart a lot. So not a big deal. Um, like, uh, like I mentioned, like saying that, um, I was watching the boys yesterday and saying that like in the homelander was like drinking a milkshake. And I was like, oh, I'd love to drink a milkshake. And then I got a milkshake this morning. Surprise. I treated myself and, um, I was just farting up a storm. So sorry. Almond milk. I don't, my, I don't know. What it is. I don't like the texture of most like the only type of milk I can drink. That's not actual milk. Milk is probably oat milk. Almond milk tastes like spit to me. Um, I also don't like eggnog for that reason. It feels like spit in my mouth and not like the fun kind. It's just like someone hacked a loogie and that's, it's only fun when I do it to you and when it's in a naughty sense, not when I'm like trying to have cereal. I don't want to have a spit bowl of spit milk cereal. I'm good with that, but thank you. I'm sounding like such a valley girl right now. What the fuck is going on? Um, but yeah. I'm wearing overalls. I'm going to take them off because they're starting to write up my cooch. Well, I'm sitting. I have a song stuck in my head. K-Tranota and Pink Pantherous did a song together, which blessed my beautiful bunny ears called Snap My Fingers. And I have her vocal stuck in my head and I'm like, oh my God. I love Pink Pantherous. Oh my God, just stepped in a shit ton of litter. Um, thank you, uh, by the way, for whomever purchased. Um, or just like you guys been heavily, heavily, heavily supporting me on Throne. And I appreciate that a lot because I, as you see, I don't put like a lot of like weeb shit or clothes or cute shit. I'm like, I need stuff for my house. And I appreciate it so much when you guys help me with that. I'm like, I need a vacuum. I need, can I have, can I have a bed frame? I like, oh my God, my bed frame was so heavy and I dropped it on my foot and I have a giant bruise on my foot now. Um, that actually doesn't look that bad. It looks bad when I first happened. But thank you. I appreciate you guys so much. Um, I don't want to sleep on a mattress on the floor anymore. I don't know how I'm going to, like in my bed is, my bed is big. I have, um, despite being like just me, I have a king size bed. Um, because I have three cats and they take up one side of the bed. And then I was just like, oh, if I get a dog, because when I move, like probably get my own house, I'm probably gonna get a dog. I'm like, where's the dog going to sleep? He's got to sleep in bed with me. Okay. Cause you know, I need like have a little puppy. Um, you know, chilling. Don't worry. If I got a dog, I would create, train it. I'm, I'm very good. Um, my family friends are dog trainers. So probably seek their wisdom. But like, I, I, I also move around. I'm weird and I also move around a lot in bed. So my mom always made fun of me cause as a baby, um, or like younger, I would always sleep in like a crescent shape. Like, I don't know what, not like my arms out, but I would just like curl to the ball, like the side of the ball. And lately when I wake up in bed, I realized if, I don't know if I'm having restless sleep, but I realized I'm waking up completely sideways. Like I just, I'm literally horizontal, not vertical on my bed. And I'm like, good thing I have a giant bed. So big bed for real little girls to sleep at the foot of the bed. Exactly. Hi, Mercy. I have a little spot for mercy. It, I like, and then, and it's like, if one of the girls slept over, which I would love to host the girls at my apartment, if that ever happened, it would be so funny. Um, cause I have enough room. I could probably get like a blowout mattress. My walking closet is huge. I could literally fit like a twin in there. Um, and then someone could take the couch and my couch turns into a bed cause you girls smart. And, uh, I have space on my floor and then one of the girls, I probably could fit two of the girls in bed with me. So, you know, although like, yeah, I think I'm the tallest out of all the girls. So I probably, I probably give the girls my bed cause I'm nice like that. And I'll be like, I'll sleep on the floor. Uh, yeah. The couch, honestly, so it's like, um, like, sorry, I just looked over at Boomi and he, you know that one picture of that cat in that, um, eating food in that one like feeder food thing and he's, it's like the recording them and stuff. And then they have names, you know, the one with like the sassy side eye. I just looked over and he was looking at me like that and it took me by surprise how much he looks like the cat looking up after eating food going. Um, you fight for the chance to sleep. She be, um, but my couch, um, and this is because like I, I have family outside, um, of my state and sometimes like my parents house is too small to probably like to have people like stay there. So I got, um, for my grandparents and my aunts and uncles when they come up from Florida, um, like, wait, it just stalks my family. I don't really care though. I forget it. I have a, oh my God, Reina is singing the song of her people. Can you guys hear that? She has her fuzzy ball and she likes to yell with it. Um, the couch is like an L shaped couch. It's kind of small, but like there's this little thing you can pull out and it makes it turn into a bed and you can put like a little bed pad on it and then just like have some blankets and I have a lot of blankets and I have so many blankets. I got you. So you're not going to be given like a cardboard box to cover yourself in when you sleep over. Um, if any of the girls watching right now have concern that if you shared the bed with any of them, you might accidentally straight, just wrangle across like toss and turn to you. I probably would just smack one of them in the face on accident. Um, I probably, yeah, I would probably just like flip. That's why I'm like, I'll sleep on the floor like in my closet. You could have probably two girls on the couch, three girls in my bed. So that, yeah, it works out. Yeah. The harem can get the cardboard. You guys can, you guys can sleep next to me on the floor and I'll just, you know, pull a little piece of cardboard on you for, for warmth. You can sleep on some cardboard and then you get a cardboard blanket. I would say thank you if you smacked me in the face. Um, no, I would never intentionally hit one of the girls unless they're like subconsciously they tell me to do that while I'm sleeping. If they're like whispering into me and they're like, hit me, hit me, hit me. I'm not going to, I also, um, tend to snore. So I was like thinking about doing for my doughnut on this like sleeping on stream. I stream and I'm like, I'm definitely going to snore, but that's fine. I think it's funny. You can bully me for that. I don't mind boxing off collab would go kind of hard. I've always wanted to do kickboxing, um, but my body is nice and frail now after having COVID and that's what set off the, the, the physical bomb within my body that gave me fibro. Do you talk in your sleep? I don't, I don't sleeping with madam. I think sleeping streams are allowed on YouTube. I'm not quite sure. Uh, I thought with your jujitsu back room and you excel in kickboxing. Yes. Like I, but like keep in mind, I haven't, I haven't done jujitsu in quite a bit because of one. I injured my shoulder really bad. Someone tackled me really good. I don't know if it popped it out of place, but I have like eternal bursitis in that shoulder. Oh, hi, bro. Thank you for the soup. One of the girls tickling your nose with the feather while the other presents herself. She's in the way of your hand. We try to swat away the thing tickling. I need that as an art piece. I, I need that drawn. Thank you for the time. Yeah. And COVID stopped us from getting you in the UFC. Dude, you have no idea. Cause I was, I was going to start competing at that point. Um, then COVID happened, which sucked. But my, my teacher was just like, it's, I think it's time that you start competing. And I had been there for, um, I forget how long, but I was just like, I was so hyped. I was so ready. Then, you know, everybody gets like, it's funny. People like, oh, you do jujitsu and then it's either they respond with yes or they're like, nah, I got injured and I'm the latter. I'm not, I got injured. I'm no chef, but boy are these titties sweaty today. I'm sorry. I was reading something on Twitter. Um, but it actually fits a lot. I'm going to retweet that because I was literally taking off my bra at the same time as I was reading that because my titties are sweaty. Um, but yeah, and I also bruise really easily. Uh, I have arthritis at the young age of 56. So in my neck, I remember I used to, I had to get injections in my neck and I know I need another one because my shoulder is acting up again because it's all nerve pain and shit. And that's why my fingers go numb and turn really, really white when I'm cold. I don't really care though. And then my customer is like, you could definitely have renoite syndrome. Um, but, um, uh, I remember I was getting injections in my neck and it was cool because the way that I was angled, I can kind of see the doctor like putting the needles in because you had to, he had to put like the ports in first and near my spine. Um, cause it's like on the lower part of my neck and then, then he had to inject it into the ports and I could see the ports going into my neck and I was like, holy, this is cool. I also had a valium that day. So I probably thought anything was cool. I never had valium before, but I felt like I was in amnesia, the dark descent. So I was having a great time. Um, I had really bad anxiety for that. So my mom drove me to and from, uh, and so the doctor afterwards, and I'm like on valium, mind you, and he's just like, so like, do you do a lot of like contact sports? And I'm like, no, I haven't done a jiu-jitsu for like a year. And he's just like, yeah, this wouldn't do that. He's like, do you do any horseback riding? I'm like, I did when I was like, like years ago. And they're just like, oh, it looks like you've been doing it recently because your like neck, it looks like it's been like bobbing a lot. And I'm like, like it's been jostled and like shaken around and just like, rut like, like my bones have grinded against each other. And I'm just like, no, I'm not. And they're like, do you stand on your head? Like, do you do yoga? I'm like, no. So my bone, like after like, I got hit when I got COVID the first time I was fine. The second time I was like, I like my body was a mess. And I like set off like all this fucking inflammation to my body because I was perfectly fine before I ever had COVID, never had an issue, never had like the worst thing was that I wore fucking glasses. So much for that. Do you stand on your head on a regular basis? Have you been spending time in a giant novelty washing machine lately? And, um, yeah. And so like, I have it in both sides of my neck and in my ankles, like pretty much on my joints. And they're just, and like, I'm in my 50s, very young for my age. Okay. So they were very confused by that. And a lot of doctors wouldn't believe me when I said like, I was feeling this symptom or that symptom because they're like, oh, that sounds like this rheumatoid or like fibro or this or that. And my mom is fibro. So I was just like, yeah. So it was just, oh, so fucking annoying dealing with doctors. Um, even recently, like go to my, I'll go to any doctor and they look at me. They see like, like I'm a healthy looking woman. I'm young at 56. And they're just like, wait, so you have this problem, this problem and this problem. No, you can't. You're too young. And you guys see, have seen how big my titties are. I'll be honest with you. I want a reduction because I'm having a lot of horrible back and neck and shoulder pain. That's, trust me, I love, I love my tick old bitties, but when they cause me pain, I can't deal with them. And my, one of the doctors that I went to said, you should just use a different bra. And I was like, gamer word, excuse me. No. Like, brother. No, no, no, no. What do you, maybe because it was a fucking man that told me that, but I was, I was pissed the fuck off. I was like, excuse me. You did not just fucking say that. Um, the anti-grab, yeah, they're like, just wear more sports bras. I'm like, what? That doesn't even make any fucking sense. Um, but this would, I'm like, that's on the back burner though. That's on the back burner. I don't even know what I'm talking about this. Um, I guess, yeah, it's because I've been in a lot of pain lately. Some were, I think that's another reason I had to like sleep because I've been in a lot of pain. My shoulder has been fucking killing me. So I just want to be honest with you, honest with you, tell you how I'm doing. Um, I am, you know, we are the Sick Girl Corpo, you know, point, fifth edition because every Corpo is a Sick Girl Corpo. Um, learning more, learning more about how Sheeby's body is falling apart. Um, Pac-Britters is a good name for heavy hand. That's a good, yeah, actually that's pretty good. Um, but yeah, please don't get reduction. Both men and women would kill to have those. How would I kill you? How about that? No, I'm kidding. In Minecraft, of course. Um, but you know, like imagine, I'm trying to think I'm an equivalent for men. It was funny because like Salem didn't quite understand why I wanted one either. And she's just like, come on. And I'm like, hold them. She's like, what? I'm like, hold them. So she took them and hold them. She's like, holy crap, this is like 10 pounds each. And I'm like, exactly, exactly this. Um, imagine, yeah, imagine your balls in the, no, like, I can't. Like take two things of flower, put them in a, like strap them, put a strap on each one of them, put that strap around your neck and hang yourself. No, I'm kidding. And, and hang them around your neck and you're in front of your chest. Like, or like balloons, not even, no, balloons are too light. Just like something heavy, take them, um, and do that. And then feel how bad, and then, and then wear a bra with it, like an underwire bra. Have that bra dig into you and not fit properly. Gallons of milk. Sure, whatever you want. A bowling. They're not that heavy. Jesus Christ. Um, but there you go. It's not fun. It cuts like I have permanent bruising in my shoulders and like, don't get me wrong. I don't want to do this. I would, if I didn't have to, but it just hurts. You know, it just hurts. It just hurts. It is what it is. And I was like, it also, they're not, they make me look a lot bigger than I am. And I don't know if you noticed in the pictures that I posted on, um, my alt Twitter of like my cosplay, but you could see like my tits start very high up and towards the like middle of my torso because they take up a lot of space on my body. Like, uh, I wish I could hold on. Let me see if I can find an, uh, oh, this will work. Oops. So imagine me having the body type that I do, which is very similar to she be here. I do have a bit of a tummy, but you know, I have a womb to protect. So I get a little, a little fat pouch there. I don't really care about that though. Um, so imagine my boob and it, it's like fucking this. Like when you wear a bra and then it makes me look like that, mind you, this is like anime girl. So the proportions are going to be a little bit different. My torso is shorter than my models. It, it would make me look freaking huge, right? Like it would make me look fat. And I've even noticed that because it hides my, um, my curves because I have an hourglass figure and that's what it does to them. It hides them. Obviously they're not that big. Again, the, my torso is different than my model, but like that's what it does. And so it makes it look like that I'm either fat or have huge fucking saggy titties. And I'm like, brother, give me some cute like B cups. So I can wear like, I can wear a shirt with no bra, you know, I want to have, I want to be that powerful, you know? Um, clown nose bitties, squeeze them honk. Clown girl for Jen too. Mom, please. Mom, please. Mother, please. I've been persuade. I've been suede. Slug girl, clown girl. Who else do I want? Um, I want a Lamia now. I want a bug girl. I also really want a pet play girl. Yeah. Although I already know, like several of the concepts for Jen too, but I just, a girl likes to dream, you know, there won't be a slime girl. Moths are overdone. There's like 50 moths. Um, a girl, that's a gun that we say. Honestly, there's not a lot of like, there's like Android V tubers, but like, there's not object V tubers because you'll have like food V tubers and animal V tubers, and animal V tubers. But like, honestly, like, um, like chainsaw man type, like a gun chuba. I'd be pretty sick. I wouldn't be averse to that. This game is super based. Are guns to it? Well, what do you mean? There's so many gun channels on YouTube. I watched this one guy whose name I has evaded me, but he just like, I don't know. I don't know if it's fucked up of me that I like to watch like the different types of bullets they use in different types of, I also like to see how guns work in real life versus the games that I use them with, like play them in, play them with. And oh my God, what the fuck is his name? I have to look it up and he uses like those gel bodies and he's like in the middle of like a desert and I don't know, like, I can't remember where he is at. He's like the middle, not of a desert, but it's like, it looks like Cali, but I don't think it's Cali. Um, and he just shoots it with his friends and they just are pretty, they're just, they just fuck about and it's funny. Garen Thump. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. Garen Thump. Yep. That's him. Yeah. Yeah. That's, that's the guy. I want to get my, my, my, my license to carry. I'm not going to lie to you. Um, I've always wanted to learn how to shoot. My grandfather tried to teach me how to learn how to shoot, but then my mom said no. And I was sad. And it's funny though, because my mom has literally worked as part of her job before. She worked with a, uh, a, a team of SEALs and for some like team bonding exercise, she learned how to clear rooms and shoot. And she was like the best shooter. And one of the, my mom was telling me that one of the soldiers is like flirting with her. And saying how good of a shot she was. And she's like, he, he, he, he, he, he. And my mom's like very like, sort of scared of like, does it like violence? And I'm like, mom, be fucking for real. Like in my life, my mom probably would have been in the military or running a 14, 500 company. Cause she's that badass. Um, Spec Ops mom. Yeah. No, she's a, she's a good shot. She is. My mom's badass. I don't think my, I don't think my dad's ever shot like at a range or anything. I have to ask him. Um, I don't know if he even wears that. She V's father is some random SEAL, dude. No, this, I was around. This is not before I was born. Well, yeah, I'm, I'm also, I'm pretty good with the airsoft rifle and I'm very good at archery from camp. Um, so not to my own horn. Uh, but I do like, I do like shooting. I think it's really good way to release like pent up stress. Um, especially you're doing it in a safe environment. I would love to get lessons. Um, I do have some friends who are military. So like harem's airsoft one, that'd be fun. Oh, like a paintball off collab would be sick. Um, previous girl scout credentials. Are there any SEAL tubers? Yeah, there's a few. Oh, like I thought you meant like SEALs, like the animal. Um, no, this, I don't, there's the only military related person I can think of as the horse. Uh, is it Tomoe or Tomo? She's like a horse girl. Um, and there's definitely, there's not a lot of military oriented. Like they'll have like old school, general artwork of them, but they're not like actually like military base. You know, there's a, there's a niche there. There's a niche there at some airsoft stuff to throw. No, where am I going to use it? I don't, there's no ranges near me. Umari Tomo. Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes, sir. She's cool. Um, I love her, her character's design. Um, close enough. Well, I can't pretty guys know, I can't pronounce Japanese names. Uh, a few tactical VTubers. And then I don't know where VSPO EN is. I always call them vispo. Um, like where are they? Where are they? Where's their gen? Where's the EN gen? I applied for that a year ago. They gave me a few views, but of course you sell. I didn't get a call back. I'm happy I didn't be alert. Um, because again, I told you guys I used to do a lot of, uh, FPS games. So I thought I could make it in. And this is even before I became a VTuber, like before I even was Rena. So I just applied as myself, just normal me. Um, what gun did I shoot before? I don't know. I remember I shot a rifle. Uh, it was like a type of rifle. I don't know. I can't remember that shit. Just because I watch gun stuff doesn't mean I know what everything's about. The SPO has the highest standards in industry because you have to be good at it. But they're like, but then again, like think about who owns the SPO. Or I was calling VISPO because it's fun. Owns VESPA. VISPO. Um, Brave Group. And Brave Group has already seen how successful that, um, before Mariah and Globi are in their normal gens. And I think I'm missing one, but I forget. Um, there are a lot of FPS girls, girlies. I don't know. I'm like, maybe they're being trained. Maybe they're, maybe they scrapped the project and focused on V for Mariah. I don't know. I don't know. But, and I know like they want to do competitive gaming as well. So, oh, thank you, boy, for the 10 gifted. Oh, thank you very much. Appreciate it. You rise up. But, um, yeah, sometimes. And then actually, can we, can we just like talk about like VTubing stuff for a second? Like, I'm not a, I'm someone who's very interested in the comings and goings of the VTubing industry and community stuff. And I tweeted yesterday as a joke, um, that I'm like, I'm going to hijack TVS. Okay. Things that VTubers say run by a false ID, uh, because he hasn't been covering small Corpo stuff and only like needy shit and someone called like someone fucking tagged him in it like he liked the tweet and I was like, lol, I was kidding. Cause I'm going to make my own. I like, I definitely want to make some of you. I used to be a commentator, YouTuber. Um, and I would like to do an unbiased, uh, what's it called, just like segment, not like too long, just talking about smaller agency news, cause that's been sorely lacking for the last little bit. Um, so I feel like that would be fun. Damn, you done it all. Yeah. Again, you guys, I said it before, I used to work for VTubing. Um, I, this wouldn't be drama based. I wouldn't, I would probably, uh, and I would also like look to you guys as like a resource. I'm smacking my headphones, um, to like be like, oh, what do you think I should talk about? Or like maybe make him into shorts, um, just but like only focus on agency VTubers. Cause I think that would be fun. Um, and Shawnee was like, hell yeah. And I was like, yeah. And then Shawnee's been supporting a lot of my ideas lately. And I'm like, yeah, I'm going to be like, I'm going to be like, I'm going to be like, so I want to like think of a name and stuff and get that ball rolling. I've been thinking about it before like back when I was Renna that I would do something like that, um, but I would cover like all news, but as an indie, but now being agency, I would rather just want to cover other like my agency and other agencies. Um, I know that might be a conflict of interest. I get that. Um, but I would probably only like objectively just say like, hey, this is what's going on. I'm not injecting feeling into it. Um, so be sucky VTuber news. Uh, should be news. Yeah, if you count me in. I'm going to have this TV, yeah. Um, actually, I was very thankful he didn't cover us because I think we've got, we've gotten more hate. Um, I've said before that when him and other VTubers first covered us debuting or being created in any mention of it, uh, they focused more in the negative comments or assumptions of the company. Um, and I feel like they might do the same if they covered us again, although because he liked my tweet, I'm kind of worried. I'm just like, oh, fuck, is he going to cover us for the next one? So who knows? Um, but whatever the fucking hat, no, it is what it is rabbit hole news. Are you funny? Um, but yeah. And then I'm like, I can like, I can't do, I have to make drama to get on, but that's not my goal. I don't want to, I don't like drama. I don't, um, I would, you could ask anybody that I'm friends with, uh, in the girls. Like I'm someone who if I hear anything like whispers of unrest, I'm like, let's get to the bottom of it. Let's talk, let's do this. What's going on? Not that that hasn't even happened, but they just know I'm that type of person. Um, there's not such a thing as bad publicity. I think there is for our case, just because of the content we do, uh, I don't know. Like I just feel like for us would be more of a detriment to our brand, but, and then just show how unprofessional we are. If I like, if we got into any sort of that stuff, um, sure drama alert girl. Um, haters gonna hate. Yeah. And it's like, and it's bad if it messes with your mental health. Yes. I wouldn't want to, I'm like, I'm here to talk about what's happened. I don't want to talk about how these two girls are bitching at each other because this, this and that happened. I'm going to say, yeah, I'm not, I don't care about that stuff. It is disappointing when there's really never any updates on something that does is negative. Yeah, it is. It's kind of a let down, uh, cause like I'm always someone who I'm like, celebrate the little victories. Um, and lately, anytime I look at something VTuber news related or VTuber related, um, or like coverage of it, it's usually something negative and it makes me sad because there's a bunch of like good things happening in the community every day. Um, but then again, like that's not, the news doesn't report like the regular news doesn't report unhappy things anymore either. I don't even watch news, like actual like human news anymore because they don't report on anything. Like it's usually like tragedy or like something bad or the weather. Um, so, and then I totally get why he would do that because Nidhi was up his ass. He's like, let me go up his ass. Let me go up their ass. And I'm like, you know what? I got it. Um, but I liked to watch it when I was an indie so I could see what like kind of what the tone was for agencies. Um, and also like what indies were doing in the, in the VTuber community because I just, I want to know everybody was up to, um, now I just don't watch any of it at all. I just listened. I like to listen to like video essays now about like things that have happened in the past. Um, I think that's interesting because I like to educate myself on VTuber history because again, I've only been a VTuber for six months. I've known and been part of the community and a consumer of VTubers since they, um, since they've been around, um, since they started back like before in like 2019 or even further than that. But I never was like in it in it, you know, VTuber weather segment. It'd be really funny. I'm out in a weather segment. I would just make makeup like random fake places and be like, it's currently sunny in Topeka. What is it? It's raining in Topeka. It was something like foster's home for measuring friends. Um, hop, happy, hoppy news tonight at 8 p.m. Happy, hoppy news tonight at 8 p.m. With your hottie host, Sheebie. I'd have to work on my transatlantic accent because I can't, um, it's, it would be hard to because I need to do like the news voice. And tonight we're expecting a light drizzle in Wonderland. Later tonight at 6 p.m. What is strongy shoving up her ass? Oh my God. Where are my mods? They're gone. They're like, she's late an hour. I can't do it. I'll do it myself. I'll do it myself. Tomorrow, it's going to be raining urine. So make sure you have your umbrellas or open your mouth. Um, sometimes I sound like I'm from a commercial and I do that. Strongy catching strings. Hey guys, can we not, can we stop talking about my investor in the chat? Thank you. Kisses. Unnecessary speculation going on about where people are from, which is, you don't need to know because it doesn't matter. Just enjoy their content. Um, that's a meme if I ever heard it. The rabbit's foot segment goes, and it's just me stepping like just like heel clacking noises. That'd be funny. There is an Aurora Borealis localized entirely in Icy's kitchen. How is she doing it? Tonight at BunnyBun capacity, what's going into she being and how much? That was good. That was, that was good. I'll give you that. I'll give you that. Okay. Need a quick look back. Oh, but, but, and then like also like, um, I would just, I just like to talk about VTubers. Like it was cool. I'm very excited to see the debuts for the new EN girls from Hall of Live. I didn't anticipate for them, for there to be a new gen so soon. I thought it was going to be a couple more months. Um, although everybody had kind of already surmised who was going to be who, but you know, like training and all that. And I'm wondering if they were hired on or scouted previously because models don't take a very long time to make unless they cranked them out because I know they have in-house people. And they have obviously being Hall of Live have pulled in the industry. But, um, uh, Raora Panthera, I can't pronounce anybody's names. Please don't hurt me. Raora Panthera, I love her design. I love her concept is so true to her. If you know who she is, uh, being an amazing artist and everything. I really like the short stack. Um, I feel like she'll be really silly. And then I feel like Blood Flame, Elizabeth Rose Blood Flame is just Narissa Red. Narissa in red. Um, so, but I like, I, everybody's, and then I was chuckling at the automaton's last name, Immigrate. And then I'm like, she kind of looks like mint, but they look amazing. They look amazing. Like, and she probably does plays violin or does some sort of music. And so I can't wait to see the type of talents they'll possess and everything. And just like, how fun they'll be. I usually, I usually don't watch, um, Hollow Live or Niji just because I don't want to fall in love again. She worry. Um, but, uh, it's, and it's also hard because you don't get the intimacy of a smaller streamer in chat. That's why I like smaller agencies. And that's why my Oshi is in the smaller agency. Um, so it's, yeah. Yeah. Trony does give us this Scorches style. Yeah, my favorite is Rod Bunny is live. How's it going? We're going, we're doing all that. Okay. I'm agreeing. Sounds like an intro. Irma Gurd. Everybody sounds like Irma Gurd names. Yeah, that's true. That's funny. Um, yeah, just, it's, it's, it just stay, and you can usually only communicate through like, text-to-speech donations. Um, which is funny because it makes for amazing clips and everything. And people write some really funny shit, but like, I like this. I can read chat. I honestly probably know all of you. It's like, right now I don't really see a lot of unfamiliar faces. So I have my regulars. And so it's very nice to have a closer intimate fan base. Who is my Oshi? You don't need to know. That's for me to know and you to never to find out. She's mine. I'm gatekeeping her. Okay. Thank you. Um, model actually is a violin, plays a bassoon, calling it now. I bet she's multi-talented. I bet she can like, play piano and stuff. Um, name a salt. Well, I'm not going to read your names right now. Oh wait, I see a new name. You must be a lurker. But thank you guys. If you're new and you remembered, um, I am, I do recognize a lot of you, but so don't think I don't know who you are. I appreciate all of you. Especially my lurkers. Because even though you don't talk, you're still watching. You still got me in the background. And I care about you for that. Thank you. Um, she remembers. Um, I do be lurking though. Yeah, that's fine. I lurk. I, I don't talk. Wind streams. Um, because like, I have like a whole alt account. Like, not, not even like Rena. Um, like I have like my own personal account that I like, I watch VTubers on. And I just lurk. I don't say anything. Um, and like, yeah, I'm trying to think. I think I only, the only time I ever talked was when Strawny, Strawny was someplace else. And that's, and like, that's how you like, I don't talk in streams. And then she got me to want to talk in streams. That's how amazing she is. Yeah, and I usually have streams in the background too for background noise. I know a lot of you guys do that or like, and because I know sometimes I stream when people are working. Um, so yeah, speaking of streaming, I haven't started the game yet, but I kind of feel like yapping because this is going to be a long stream. Um, I'm, maybe this will be an endurance stream, uh, just because, um, I love this game. And I love spending time with you guys. Um, I'm just ashamed of my green name status. That's why I lurk. Oh, yeah, hide yourself. I don't show your face. Gray name, terrible. No, I'm kidding. Um, but, uh, even if you're not green and your name is gray, don't think I don't appreciate you. Um, I just appreciate you less now. Ow, hurt my rib laughing like that. Um, also, um, Immi, I think is going live right now. So if you wanted to go see Immi, uh, I forget what she's playing, but you can go check her out. Um, her, her info is in my description as well. Um, what build do you tend to go for? I kind of just wing it every run. I used to abuse the Orborus. Oh, thank you for the 10 gifted authority. Thank you. Appreciate it. Speaking of which, I don't know if anybody, I don't have my headphones on, so I can't hear if somebody like don't know. Let me look. I need, I'm, I might get IEMs. Um, what do I mean? I remember what they're called, but like the essentially earbuds, just because headphones with my glasses on hurt my ears. They're the ones that these are in ear monitors. Yeah. Um, You just get more spit from Georgia Tech U. Um, but no, like if you show up, that's all that matters to me. Um, I also decided because I'm starting to think it's causing somewhere divide between everybody's fan bases. I don't mind if you have somebody else's Oshimarks in your name. I was doing it for Kayfabe, um, but I'm realizing I don't like, like I'm pretending to be mad because you like somebody else. It's you can like multiple streamers, especially ones in our gen. Um, and yeah, I just I don't know. I've been here since be a lure first form on Twitter. I feel like an old woman. Can't wait to see you all grow and have the privilege of looking back on these streams. Oh, yeah. It's, I've been there since the beginning too. So I'm right there with you, sis. I can't see a new she beat. It's for me, not you. Keep it in the family. Yeah. Keep it in the family. That's how what I'll say. You can keep it in the family. Although like, but it's funny because I'll like, I'll see other people's Oh, she marks. Like I think I saw like a Maya whispers and like she's a, oh my God, a giant fucking June bug just landed on my window and scared the shit out of me. Holy crap. The thing is huge. Um, staring at me. But like, I like a Maya whisper. She's a good, you know, as martyrs and stuff. So I'm like, I don't really care. Um, I just like, I just, I'm a type of person and I think that's why me and strongy are so much alike that I'm like, just support everybody. If you can do what you can. If you want, cause you know, everybody's so talented. Everybody's so cool. Cause like, I love a lot of the other agency girls. Again, I used to be indie. I followed and looked up to a lot of the people that are, yeah, but so I'm like, I can't be like, Oh my God, don't hate me. Don't, don't, don't stop. Can't love. You have to love me more. I just want you to love me more or less. Um, and I think, yeah, I think, I think it's a healthier mentality for me. Cause I do, I, I'll be honest with you. I do get jealous and I realize feeding into that mindset for me for kayfabe is, is actually not good for me. Um, cause I remember back when I was Rina, I would feel immense jealousy when something happens. And now I'm just like, no, I've kind of grown from that. Um, cause I'm just like, why am I upset that somebody else is supporting a streamer that I also enjoy? I'm like, fuck that. No, like that's, no. But, um, again, and another thing, cause I was asking Mercy to explain it to me. Um, because I know she, she, uh, she gets bothered by stuff. Um, so she was explaining to, I smacked my mic, explaining to me like, oh, she culture, like, and what, how, what oh, she's mean and commie. Not that I didn't know already, but just like on a deeper level, like really picking it apart and like telling me, so I really appreciated her to do that. Cause then I understand. I'm like, oh, I got it. I understand. I get it. Like not this. Thank you for explaining it to me. Um, don't want to put sugar in chat. I do, again, I, again, I do, if you, I do want you to be collared to me, but I can't force you to do that. Um, there's just she be only she be, and I've also kind of just decided and then like, cause I was talking to a straw knee and one of the managers about it too. Um, I think I put too much effort in stock into a kayfabe, um, which is my kayfabe is, you know, dummy mommy mistress. Oh, I'm going to step on you. When the reason I was hired was because of my voice and my personality. I wasn't, it's not like I'm acting and cast to play an actual character. That's not what V tubing is. Uh, it's like who's line is it anyway? Where the points don't matter. The kayfabe barely fucking matters only for like assets. A little bit of backstory for your appearance, vice versa. Um, kayfabe, if you don't know is a wrestling term, which is like your lore, your backstory, your history of their character that you play. Um, and I was just, and this might filter some people and that's fine. And I was talking to strongy and one of the managers about it and I was just like, I had, I said to her, I'm like, I realized the other day because I was having so much imposter syndrome because I was like getting so worked up that I wasn't good enough to be she be. And then strong is like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, shut up. Like you were always meant to be she be you were my she be. I didn't pick you because you could be a dummy mommy because I wasn't. If you guys don't know who I was, I was Rina who was a fucking lolly sub bitch brown cat. Like I'm total opposite of me. She's like, I picked you for you. And I'm like, you know what? And that goes for the other girls. She picked us for us, not the characters we play. But like I enjoy playing into the dummy mommy. Like don't don't get me wrong. I do like doing that. Um, because I do like, you know, getting you guys little riles up. Oh, um, and I was just like, you know what? You're fucking right. I'm not going to have imposter syndrome anymore because she picked me out of hundreds of other people just because I'm a goofy motherfucker. Okay. She watched, she sat down and watched my streams. The team that she hired also like she selected me and then she went to the team was like, what do you guys think? And they're like, oh yeah, 100%. She's our first choice. So at the end of the day, I'm just going to be me. You'll get dumb. You'll get girl fail. You'll get this. You get that. Um, and that's made me feel so much more better. Just real. I'm like, and it's funny because nobody fucking cares about kayfabe in the VTuber community, except lately for us. I'm like, nobody usually cares about fucking lore. But suddenly everybody cares about us. Stick it to our fucking lore. You can't see. I'm shaking my hands, leaning back. Um, and yeah, I'm like, I'm just, and I'm not saying this because like I'm angry or anything. I'm just saying this because like I've come to the realization. Like I, I'm becoming more comfortable being she be like, I feel like she's me now because I'm acting as myself. I'm not pretending to be someone I'm not because then you just get burnt out and you just get unhappy. And that's where a lot of VTubers crash and burn is because they think they have to play an actual character when in fact they were just hired for their voice and for who they were in their content prior to being cast. Um, but yeah, uh, also new. Yeah, I'm new. Like, don't forget that I haven't finished VTuber for long. Um, for ABVTubers, it's not kfave, it's anti-tax, which are on my Patreon. Like you still get that stuff on my Patreon. Um, yeah, I think everybody shouldn't care that much about stuff because like, look at Icy, she's supposed to be a brat. She's so cute and sweet. That's fine. And then look at Amy, she was supposed to be the sweet and cute one and she's a brat. And that's great. And then Azura is, you know, she's like quirky, funny, um, giggly little goat. And she's not like, oh, my sweet little boy all the time. That's fine. And then like, you know, strongy is strongy. And then Mercy's Mercy. And like you guys fall in love with us because of us, not because of the, because of our pat, like our fake kfave, you know? And yeah, it's great. Like it's not even Gap Moe, like, because it doesn't matter that much because we were meant to be these people. Azura is also a brat. Ooh, I didn't know that. Like, oh yeah, we're, we're a wacky little gang. I'm just a funky little rabbit. Um, yeah. And the chemistry is authentic. Um, bad of anatomy. I added to my schedule next week a drawing stream. So I hope you guys will enjoy that. Um, yes. And it's like, I don't have to be that. That's, that's in the other content that's in the Patreon. And I don't want you guys to put so much pressure on yourselves or the girls to be like, oh, like, I know a lot of people don't watch me because they're like, oh, I'm not into hard fandom. But I'm like, I'm not doming the chat 24 seven. Like that's not like, give everybody a chance because I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. Like you probably are watching me right now saying, oh, I don't think I'd like one of the smaller girls because I like big jugs. Um, yeah, but like, Amy's funny as fuck. So go watch her. She's just as base as I am, if not more. I know she's definitely more than me. But, uh, yeah, just here to be entertained. Oops, all brass. Uh, but it's, it's like, is it? Yeah, you're supposed to be dominant, but you show up. No, no, no, I'm not supposed to be anything. I'm just supposed to be myself. And that's the mindset. I want to teach you guys is that all the girls are not supposed to be this, this, or that because of a kayfabe and like a character design. We're just us. I'm just she be and you're just can. Um, she's telling us by teaching us, but like, naturally, I'll still pull out like, you know, don't get it twisted. I still will beat you when you're naughty because I like that part of my kayfube. I like leaning into that. And the girls do like, do like leaning into different parts of theirs. Um, but I just wanted to make that distinction for everyone that we were hired to be us. And I don't want you to get so wrapped up, you, the viewer, you, the fan to get so wrapped up and want somebody, um, should be like due to their lore that you don't enjoy their, their, their content because you can enjoy. So like, I'm not gonna, let me, I'm trying to think of somebody. Uh, I'm not a huge fan of mystery novels. Does that mean I'm going to hate Amelia Watson? No, she's funny because she's, she'll play into stuff sometimes, but she's not constantly searching for mysteries. Um, who am I? I'm she be. I'm she be just me. You can find out who I am by watching me stream. You aren't enough. Atmospheric people make your mom jokes and such. That's what I like. I'm not big into Dom in general. And it's like how she be expresses herself. Yeah, exactly. I want you to watch me for me. Not because of the tags that are associated with my ASMR content on Patreon. You know, um, what do you mean she's not detective? The real mystery was the friend she made along the way. Oh, hi. Feeling like I can hire Amelia to find my dad. Oh my God. Oh, really? I can find your mom in these. Your mom. I like listening to your voices soothing. Yeah, I'm a yapper. I'm a yappiest yabbit in all the West. I mean, you don't own a brothel. No, I do. Don't, that's actually real. Sorry. But please, in short, give all the girls a chance. Just because you don't like a certain tag doesn't mean you won't enjoy their content. Because we're all just cute girls doing cute things. And I would hate for you to miss out on cute girls being cute. You know? If you have another Oshimark besides Madams, nook if you book. Nook if you book. Right. No, if you book. Instantly plays. Get ready. Thank you for the tip, Anonymous. I think when I see somebody else's Oshimark, I just know that you are really passionate about other creators. And I know you still like me. And I've learned not to take personally that you like us in different ways. And there's only so many characters you can do to put in somebody's name. I see people with a bazillion Oshimarks in their name. It looks fucking cluttered. So I get it if you just want one. Because then I recognize the majority of them. Like there's one that's Azura's. And I'm like, yeah, I love Azura. Or if it was somebody else. Oh, yeah, I see Stroneys. Yeah, I love Stroneys. Or if it was like some girl from Pixelink. Oh, yeah, I love Kana. You know? It's yeah, so nice knowing people support my friends. That's all I care about. I am the type of person as a streamer that if I ever got like blew the fuck up, I would be doing everything in my power. Literally. This is why I want to join a vealer because Stroneys doing exactly what I wanted to do. I'm like, I just want to raise up smaller creators to a bigger platform and support them and give them stuff so they can do whatever they want. And have a great time and chase their creative dreams. That's what I would fucking want too. What if you don't like Lawley? I don't know what to tell you. Uh. Start liking them. I don't know if you don't like the body type. It's like, yeah, people don't like, I won't watch some streamers because I don't like the art style of their model. So I totally get that. I'm like, I'm not into super Western eyes. Like mine's a little bit Western, but not too much art styles. So like, that's fine. I'm not going to fuck them. Yeah, but like, I used to also not like that type of body type model than I watched. Uh, who was it? I forget who it was. What the fuck was it? Are they graduate? I think they graduated and that's my camera. They're on the top of my head because I haven't watched them in a while. But then I was like, oh my God, wait, this bitch is funny. Oh, she's a really good voice actress. And I like wondered how like people sometimes, you know, girls put on voices and some don't. I'm like, wow, um, all that stuff. I don't watch almost all male vTubers because of the same reason I can still watch some of their funny and nice. Yeah. I usually don't watch male vTubers, uh, because I just can't really, I just can't really, um, what's it called? Relate to them because I like, some of them have like really bro streams. Um, so I'm just like, this is for them. This is for the, this is for the bros. You're like, this isn't for me. Um, and then some of them are also very BFE, which makes me cringe out of my fucking mind. But like, I've watched like one or two clips, but it just isn't for me. But everybody has their preferences. You're allowed, you're allowed preferences. Um, skill issue. If you don't like that. That's funny. There's this difference between a vTuber with a small frame and lolly little for me. Yeah. There's also that. I agree. Cause like, I look at like, uh, Amy Asami and she's not, she's like small, but she's not lolly. You know, like, I was like looking at pretty lady. I know I prefer to look at pretty ladies. And also, I'll be honest with you, another reason I don't watch male vTubers is because, um, they are so limited in their outfits and they're rigging. Like I'm sorry, but I've seen so much better rigging for female vTubers. And because like just the movement of female vTubers, I don't know what it is. It's just, it's just different and men are like the male vTubers usually very stiff. Um, I've seen a couple with really good rigs because like I'm someone who I look at when I watch a streamer, I appreciate the art, uh, behind it all, like in terms of the actual art and the rigging. Um, and a lot of male vTubers just fucking don't have good fucking rigging or they also have like really boring ass toggles. So I'm sorry. Male vTubers don't, don't, don't cover my neck please. Bald physics. So when, yeah, when we get the best designs, I'm like, I'm tired. I'm seeing the same fucking, fucking Ikemen, Ikemen. I can't pronounce it. You can make fun of me. It's fine. Style. Like you all dress the same in different fonts. I'm done. Thank you. Enjoy the, enjoy those emotes, girly pop. Um, can't really watch you vTubers. vTubers is not my cup of tea. Brother, what are you doing here? What are you, what are you doing? This, this agency. Brother, I think you're lost. Um, it's just like in video games, female characters always look better. Yeah, literally. No, that's why so many dudes just play female characters. My dad will play female characters when he plays games. And I remember, I remember like, I'll just like be ragging on them for it. I'm like, dad, why are you this chick with big titties? He's like, because she got big titties. And I'm like, look at her and she's dressed way better. Look at all the dudes skins versus the girl skins. And I'm like, you know what, you're fucking right, dad. Um, Facebook shop blocks go hard. We were hot men in games. It'd be that simple. It'd be that simple. If I can create a kid. Yeah, women have like so much funner's things. Like I remember when I played Baldur's Gate for the first time, I was like, okay, I'll make a girl and a boy. Baldur's Gate 3. So I made a girl. She was just really cute, like, elven, for like dark, for like, I can't fucking remember what I made her. But she was like tan skin, bright red hair, freckles, really cool, like tattoos, all this other shit, like makeup, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And then I went to the do the dude and I'm like, okay, I can do beard one, two, three, four, five. I can change the eye color. I can give him a scar. Women pretty. Dress up is, I love dressing up like in like games, like I'll usually take like, I take forever. The majority of me playing Elden Ring, probably like 50 of those hours is me just like trying to look pretty. Men get toothpick or burly. Literally, literally though. I'm picking guys too, but the options be limited. Whenever it comes to RPG stuff, I always make a male, female, self-insert, but I often play the female character more often, even though I'm a guy. Yeah, it's just more appealing to look at. And like, I'll like growing up, I usually played a lot of male characters, just because I didn't like being pointed out, being female and just kind of like griefed in, in games and stuff. And I'll be honest with you, I probably made the same character over and over and over again, just some emo looking dude. Some emo like looking twink was my character throughout the years. I'm just like black hair, eyes, some gothy looking outfit in your golden. And that's what I did. And then I did it because I didn't want to play a female and be all like, and be the center of attention. Oh gee, can you date me? Literally though, literally, I would just get like, oh, I just, I couldn't. And that's why I like, I didn't, I didn't, I wouldn't talk in like, game lobbies. The same reason too. We need she be to play Stila Blade. You just want me to drool in like, the entire time. Ah, so Shibani is, she'd be his ideal man. Are you a girl? Or just like people be like, hey, let's be friends. And then they try to like, just like, E-sexing you up. Oh, we'll have some straights this mail. Um, just be so cool. I remember people used to say, uh, call like, say grill, like G-R-I-L-L. Cause I think, or like, man, like I would play Wolf Quest. And which I'm going to be playing next week as well. We're playing fucking Wolf Quest. And we're going to go find a mate and have puppies. And, um, and, uh, people would say grail, grill. As in like cook, as like mail, as in like M-A-I-L. Cause people kept asking about it. And they would just do, to fucking so much E-sex and Wolf Quest. I used to say I was a boy in every game straight out. Cause I was like, yes, literally, four gets it. A hundred percent. I would literally just do that. I remember I went by like a mail version of my IRL name. And I remember I had the girlies still fucking falling for me though. You know, nobody can, I need a, I need a lip bite toggle. And we have to ask mom for that. Mom, can I, can I get a lip bite toggle? So I could be like, wait, can I, no, I can't do anything similar. Shaboris. Yeah, I was Shaboris all the time. Insane aura. And uh, yeah, it was just, it was just easier. And then I would have to tell the girlies. They'll be like, why don't you get a voice call with me? And I'm like, types out, sorry babe. Uh, I'm too shy. Yeah, I remember I was like, I'm guy on the line as a dude for a bit. And I was a girl. How many female moms? Mike doesn't work. Sorry, my mic's broken. Baby case. Oh, if I was a dude or if I was a lesbian, I would be a fucking menace to society. I would be a womanizer. I just feel like I would be the shittiest fucking dude. I would just be the opposite because like me, I'm a very sweet, very caring, I'm a very affectionate, lovable person if I really like you. I am very protective over people that I care about, but I just feel like if I was a dude, I'd just be a piece of shit. I would definitely be an F boy. I think I would be a fuck boy. Hey, you wanna be my discord kid? I would love to see my hands as a necklace around your neck, baby girl. Some pictures of your asshole. Can you mail for me, kitten? Dad actually, no, I'm above that. Tom boy, she be when I'm already a tomboy. I think, I think I am in my tomboy. I don't know. I was like very, again, growing up, I was always taller than all the boys and I've always been very, very fucking strong. I remember one time I was playing basketball with these kids and I don't know why I did this, but I picked one of the guys up off the ground and I threw him back down to get the basketball from him and he started crying and I called him a little bitch. And I'm like, why are you crying? And then he's just like, and I was like, we were like 14. It's not like we were like seven. It's like we were like 14. And I like chucked him. And then I also used to play a lot of football at my after school program because we had a lot of sports there. So it was very like my after school program was very athletic. And so we would play football. I would be fucking mowing down the boys in my grade. American football. Yes. And soccer too. And you know, European football. I would be mowing down motherfuckers. I wasn't a bully. I wasn't a bully. I was just bigger and stronger than people. I can't help it. I would fucking everybody. I was like five, six at age 14. What do you want me to do? I'm sorry. All you bros were fucking five feet tall. What do you expect me to do? I'm going to fucking roundhouse kick you to the face. I'm five, six. I'm taller than you. Bro, I'm five, eight. I'm so sorry. Have you stiff arm? I don't know what that means. Like, I don't know what that means actually. They're five feet and 14 at their time. Flexing female puberty. It's true though. It's true. I remember I was like, how old was I? Because you start, you go through puberty when you get your period. I think I was like 12. One. I had fucking C cups at 14. My parents were concerned. Again, I was also five, six at that age. My family was very concerned. So they took me to the doctor and they were like, oh, she needs to stop drinking milk because I was drinking, like the milk I was drinking, I think it still happens to kids, but they have so many hormones in them that I grew up way too fast. They, if I didn't stop drinking milk, they said the hormones in the milk, I would have been, they said I would have been like six feet tall. I was, I was growing too fast. I was, I was in so much pain because I was growing too fast. Five, 11 at 14, six foot two. See, okay, you're like, that's fine. They said, oh, she's going to be either from five, nine to six, four when they're like estimating my height. My mom is five, five and my dad is six, four. And then my mom was just like, oh God. And then my dad's like, I can teach her to ball because my dad was a basketball coach. I can't do basketball. I fucking suck at basketball. I preferred, I preferred like football or soccer for sports. And everybody would always ask like, oh, you play ball. Oh, you must play ball. You so to, oh, you're only 14. You must play ball. I'm like, no, no, brother. I don't, I fucking suck. I can run fast. And like my dad was, I swear my dad was sort of supportive because I couldn't play basketball because again, my dad was like, what was it? Like a heist, I have to look it up. Like an amateur league basketball coach. My dad was good at it too. Have you juked anyone out in football? A hundred percent. A hundred percent. I had the tightest fucking turns, bro. Tight. Whippin' that shit, bro. How rich I school interaction. But it's funny because like, I was like, I was, I had like a sleeper built. I had a sleeper built. I was tall. I was skinny as fuck. You're like, oh, she can't be strong. No. I'm chucking you across the room. I'm chucking you across the field. I'm sending you home crying to your mom because apparently I'm playing too rough with the kids because I don't know my own strength. Listen. And like, also I was super fucking shy. But then like, I got this like animalistic for feralness about me when I would play sports. And then, and same thing, same thing with fucking jujitsu. Dudes would be like, because it was a co-ed school. I couldn't roll. I didn't roll with a lot of the girls because uh, well, some of the girls didn't want to roll with me because I was just, I was just stronger. Um, but like not, not that you can't submit somebody, but when you're learning, it's not fair. Cause then at that point, you don't have the skill to beat someone stronger than you. So I would have to roll with the guys or people have a higher belt. Just because I would just hold you there. Like I, I was strong enough, especially my fucking legs. I would just hold you there and just let you squirm, squeeze you between my legs. You try to get out, but I'm going to comeore you or a more economy you. I'm, I'm sorry. You know, you're in my guard. I could still do that if you're in my guard. For free? For free? For free? I sound like I'm really fucking humble bragging though. I'm scared the pegging might be real. Um, maybe when we get fans late, I'll be loud. Cause people keep asking me, when are you gonna get a strap? And we just, do you want me to sit there like a fucking, how some dudes do it? How some dudes send, take pics and just be like, you like what you see. Do you like this angle? Do you like this? And I'm like, you want me to take pictures like that? What do you want me to do? Please test these moves on us. I beg of you. I'm sorry. Not that I don't like tributes, but or I should call them something else. Stroni said I needed to say code words for things. I should work on that. Um, not saying I don't like treats. The fuck is on my, the fuck is on my titty? I'm a fucking zit. Okay. Don't touch it. Um, not that, uh, I don't like like, like little treats that I get sent, but I'm like, I compare like the girlies on Twitter that be posting their pictures and then the dudes on Twitter that be posting their pictures. I'm sorry. Girls win. They're a lot more creative with their poses. Dudes just stand. I wish I could demonstrate. I also want to, um, I saw that Cottontail VA to the thing where, um, she like crushed a milk jug between your thighs. I definitely want to do that for like a milestone. Maybe when we hit 10 K, it's funny. Like, I just want to say like, literally my goal, one of the goals I put in my debut was hit 10 K subscribers and we're already at six K and I'm just like, what the fuck? I'm like, I expected to be at like 800 by now. She's a watermelon too. Oh shit. Okay. Man, I need to work out again. I've been, I've been, since I've been laid up at home, being depressed. I haven't, I haven't worked out. I need to, I need to do stretches. I need to get ready. I don't look at pics of dude on Twitter. Uh, neither do I, but the Twitter algorithm just fucking happens and shit just shows up. So he's hit 10 K right now. But yeah, I just, I'm just very thankful for the amount of growth that we've had as a company. It just boggles my mind to be honest. I didn't, not that I didn't believe that we could do it. I just didn't think just because of like negativity and coverage and all that stuff. I just didn't think people would enjoy us as much as they do and I'm so happy. How would you describe your peak build? Like Elden Ring? No, like on a partner or on myself? Because for me, I don't really care what you look like. I'm like, I would just want you to be healthy and be really funny. And then for myself, I would like B cup titties. And I would like to shrink my tummy a bit. That is it. Although if I could, I would look like lean beef patty, but my body type just won't allow that. Because like genetically, because like guys are like, oh, flat stomachs. Oh, like I'm like, I'm, I'm skinny, average size. But because of my genetics and being a woman, uh, people are like, you're fat because I have a little protective pouch of fat around my uterus. If I were to have a child, um, even my mom, who at my age was like 99 pounds, if not less than little, no, she was definitely like a hundred pounds and like five, five, she was sure as fuck and skinny as a fucking rail. She also didn't have a flat stomach because just genetically, she just had a little bump. Child makes it better. That's my, I agree with you. I agree. Squish is good. A little bit more hold on to, you know what I'm saying? Not that I don't enjoy like a skinnier build though. Like I, I honestly, I love the human form so much. Becoming so many shapes and sizes. It's gorgeous. I love it. Men and women appreciation in this house. Okay. You're cute. You're gorgeous. You're beautiful. Let me kiss you. I was going to say something else, but I can't say that. It doesn't even look bad based on your photos. Looks pretty. I can't, I know that you're like trying to compliment me, but that sounds weird. Yours don't even look that bad. I don't care how people think about my body type either way. One, because I'm a Vtuber, you're barely going to see it. That was just for the monetization milestone. I'm not cosplaying myself constantly. I'm sorry if you thought that you're going to see me blasting my, my kuchi-hu-ha on fans. Lee, that's not going to happen. No, it's only to use straight homeboy. I'm, you're going to, you're going to get the model. Oh hi, Rena. I mean, it's all right. Like it could be better. Like, I'm sorry. You're not going to see any real life content from me. I don't know about the other girls, but not from me. I'm here to make ASMR. I'm here to voice act. I'm here to be, you know, your girly pop or something. Don't only get to your head. I'm here to be your mistress. You don't make demands of madam. You get little treats now and then. I think anyone's complaining. Yeah. Because some people are like, oh, they're going to be like, the Emma G girls. No, we're, no, at least I'm not fucking doing that. It's hot though, but I'm sorry. And I'm not fucking my gen mates in an off collab. How does this weird business practice? I'm not a porn star. But what girls, there are other, there are Japanese AVTuber agencies that do that sort of content. And I don't knock them for it. I think it's fucking amazing that you get essentially as a porn star VTuber. Like that's fucking sick. But yeah, ruined. I'm going to have, guys, should I have a watermelon blueberry or the mystery color airhead? I also need to get a drink. Quite thirsty. Have you finished the main story for inscription yet? Bro, I didn't even start playing the game yet. We're just talking. I've been in inscription like three times. I just haven't done them on stream mystery. Mystery. Okay, we sing mystery. I'll do mystery, then I'll do watermelon because people are saying watermelon. Johnny's asking how long I'm streaming. Probably too late. Why does she message me? Hold on, okay, discord. Oh my God, a giant fucking. What is that? What is that fucking bug? I need to take a picture. Holy shit. What is this? Mind you, I know my bugs. I've never seen this before in my life. What are you? Hello? Okay, it looks like it has the body of a wasp. It was the head of an ant. It's very thin and narrow. I thought it was like a locus or something, but it's not a cricket. The legs are too small. What the fuck? I need to piss. I just choked on this fucking thing. I'm sorry. Okay, I'll respond to the letter. Um, the girl leaves for my collab tomorrow, like, hey, thumbnail. So I'll post something more later. Hi, Sheeby. Mom, I'd like to redirect here. You think you'd be... Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 100%. I'm gonna be up for a couple hours. I gotta piss. Sorry, I'm gonna keep saying that until I go. Hmm. The watermelon's good. It might be a persic, wa. I don't know, it's so huge. It's probably... I'm trying to think of a comparison. Using my pill bottle. It's like, I have a 15 pro phone. It's like half the size... It's like, lengthwise, it's half the size of my phone. But it's super... I've never seen this butt before. It's staring at me. It's literally looking at me. I know it's looking at me. What the fuck are you, bro? I need to identify you. I can't see his waist. What are you doing, bitch? Stop staring at me. Staring at me because I'm not wearing pants. Remember, Plee comes from the club door. Let him inside? Okay, yeah. It has six legs, two long antennae, long narrow body, reddish, reddish-orange, ants moving like head, but doesn't have the jaws of an ant. It's like that. The head shape of the eyes. It looks like it's divided in three sections. You have the head, the middle section, and the body. But it's very little distinction between the main body and the latter part of the body. It literally just turned its head to look at me. It's literally looking at me. Why do you have so much self-awareness, bro? Stop. By the way, should we do a play on the weekends? Quick ball. I'm doing the UNO club. I might do a gorilla debating. I do realize I need to probably take breaks, though, like have a dig off. Do you need me to cover her cleavage? Oh, yes. Wait, did mommy read? Or is she just asking for like 20 minutes or not? But yeah. I need to do the corals, please. Orange, orange, orange, orange, orange, orange, orange, orange. Say what I really want. I'm sorry. Boats. Back. Like a wasp. This literally looks like none of them. It looks like a wasp, but it isn't. This again, I'm sorry. I'm a very curious person. This is going to bother me if I don't figure out what the fuck this bug is. I like bugs. This one's giving me weird vibes. He just shat on my window. Maybe he's a shit. Maybe in room. Don't want to tell me who he is. Oh, he just flew away. Fuck. No, I need to study you. Maybe we're new form of insects. What the hell? Okay. Elden ring. Oh, that's right. It released today. I have to mute Elden Ring then on my excuse me, on my stream. I mean, on my Twitter. Don't want any spoilers. Let me take a photo and ask AI. I took a photo. I was going to show it to you guys, but it would expose where I actually know. So, I zoom in, hit top, crop that, and crop, crop, crop it, crop these. Fucking load. 69. Nice. I'll post it later. Wait, can I? Look up bug. Up here. That one just like that. Again this one. Born-tales. Yes. A little bit lighter in this whole here. lighter in the color. It's in body shape. I like knowing things. If you don't f**king like that I talk, then go home. You don't have to watch. You can click off to show off your computer and walk away bro. I feel like yapping. I feel like I haven't yapped. I don't know why it feels like I haven't streamed when I streamed recently. I'm eating my last airhead. They're mini airheads. I'm yapping some voices in my head. Yapping my heart's potential. I've been craving airheads lately so I got some. Usually I'm a gummy worm kind of gal, but they didn't have any of them. I don't know what you're talking about. I'm going on vacation. I'm going to leave you with this sh**. Thank you for becoming a member brother. I remember watching a video of somebody freeze drying those giant snake ones. I got some beef jerky. I also have some bueno. Oh wait, I guess I ate the bueno and I didn't remember. So that's a lie. I just have beef jerky next to me. You don't have a Twitter account? We give you so many f**king freebies on there. Because that's like us actually doing stuff. Whereas in the ASMR, well I don't know. Some of us might be actually doing stuff. But mostly the ASMR is just us recording the script. That's pure unfiltered real amateur audio on Twitter. It's not as she be streaming until she's an hour plus and so is the start of the game. Stop it! Stop! Stop complaining! Stop pointing it out! How do you learn how to growl? Whatever you do, don't eat the famous gamer gummy control. What is that? Almost said two hours.

Um It was curse her racism needs to be it's no it's funny. No what I was gonna say is that um you No, I'm um portuguese from portugal Azores um missable wad I'm a very mixed bag. I thought this was a mixed hag and I liked that Part native american. I'm actually not native american at all. I thought I was Because you know, there's always like someone in your family when you're american that claims that you're that you're native They're like, oh, yeah, like we're like one eighth Cherokee And so when I did my like 23 and me Ancestry test, I'm like, oh, I wonder if I'm native and there's like nothing there about being native and I'm like My grandma fucking lied to me. They also said that we were italian too. I'm not italian Although it's funny because my mom looks very italian Italian, I don't know. I'm saying it like that I am part native american indian. I mean, oh you are. Why would you call it native american indian then? Why don't you just say you're a native american? Or an indigenous person You don't fucking say indian I don't know if you remember the other portion of that meme as uh with norman osborne as a different color Um Uh Sheeby speaks that gabagoo 100% french here from like two villages Shout out to the colonizer then sheeby. Thanks mom. Whoo My dad it's okay. My dad's my dad's country where the was the first country to become independent from slavery. Let's go. Whoo um but No, like i'm a very it's it's so funny because on the internet I feel like i've been so corrupted Because i'm very Like and I don't care if you fucking hate me for saying this. Um, I'm very lgbtq friendly. I'm very progressive I'm very much a liberal friend Uh, and I just I don't know why I'm like this online I'm just an absolute fucking prick online, but you know I like I like having a little bit flavor It's like everybody nobody say like I'm not and I'm like I'm generally like I don't really give a fuck about uh Like if somebody says something Offensive or ignorant to me. I will put them in their place for their ignorance But I know I know the context of what's a joke and what's not a joke exactly jokes And I I enjoy dark humor. Yes I don't take personal offense Like sometimes people do just like say things in poor taste like when I was when I was younger. Um So my hair is curly you can see my beautiful curly hair I lost tracking because it's dark. Hold on. Let me turn on the light. Um Okay, turn on the light I have beautiful curly hair Um, so I usually uh With my type of curls, I'll put it up in like a Like a like I'll put in a silk bonnet so that my curls stay nice when I sleep And um, did I imagine I could love my she be more? Um And so my friend who's white Was just like making fun of me And I'm just sitting there with my with my bonnet on Um letting my hair dry after showering at her house because we're sleeping over She's like making fun of me and I'm like what why why you making fun of my bonnet? She's like because you look like you should belong on my family's plantation picking my cotton And I just kind of just stayed at her and I'm like Like I'm like I could make A way funnier joke than that That was just bad I'm like that was just dumb Like that's when your white friend gets too fucking comfortable with you and just thinks they could say anything and she apologized afterwards And I'm just like Brother it's to me. It's only funny when it's self deprecating humor Like um No shot someone is that oh Are you kidding me bro? Oh, please Oh, please there's uh when you're um When you're a mixed kid, uh Again, you're too white for the black kids. You're too black for the white kids And so When you're too black for the white kids, they'll make they'll think it's okay to make jokes like that And I just I don't really give a shit because it's one. I just just don't give a reaction And I don't care. Um, and then when it's black kids making fun of you for being like too white Um, they'll do the same thing and so They'll just say like, uh What did that fucking say? I think they like I remember these black kids said something about my mom Being like a snow bunny And I just looked at them like I cool anyways moving on Um And then like it's funny It's only funny to me when like you make fun of yourself or you make fun of your own race And that's why like I'll watch comedians who do that um Then it's funny to me, but like when it's someone who's just like, haha Your gamer word and I'm just like, okay Was that was supposed to be like come on. You could have said that in a better way like, you know Your racism from all sides and no, it's not racism. It's just ignorance like there's I haven't experienced like real racism in like a very long time. I'll be honest with you. Um It's usually people just like trolling and like just wanting to get a rise out of me Which I don't really think they're necessarily racist. They're just like just kind of be a stupid, you know um Yeah, the last time I had someone like be legit racist was when the story I told before Or someone called me the gamer word when I wouldn't give them their Their pickup order because it was or it was canceled for some reason. Um And then before that I had this European woman um Definitely talked to me like, you know how sometimes like older folks speak to like Darker skinned folks a certain way. They'll be like, hey boy get over here So she spoke to me like that. I was like, I don't Okay, she called me she called me girl. She's like girl and she had like a very thick accent um condescending Kind of like talk slow like I didn't know how to speak English And I'm like, I'm from fucking america. I was born here I was literally fucking born here. You don't have to talk to me like that, dude. I can understand. I can't speak any other language, dude um Girl come here. Grab me mine. Give me your finest ways Um, but again, I don't take it personally because people are just gonna be fucking ignorant and you know, they'll just die off someday So I don't really give a shit um It's just I just think of it in like in hindsight and I just like laugh like when I was super young I was like Really sensitive like super fucking sensitive and then I started playing csgo and I grew out of that real quick um My once got asked if I had a green card and trigger me to kick him out of the store. That's fucked. That's fucked Pulling over butter. Yeah, I'm like I'm like token Just kidding though. Uh, yeah the boomers will die off. So, you know, they'll die. We'll be fine Although I'm getting up an age being 56. It's it's kind of scary Sorry, drink some water. How you doing right now? Your eye is watering I don't have a knack at near me or a wipe your little eye Oh my god We're already way better than like 30 years ago. Yeah I'm gonna hit 60s in that ropes break off. Yeah Means like the finest wine we're getting cougars Yeah, I'm 56 you guys if you guys don't know I'm 56. I am the oldest vtuber in the vtubing community Uh for real 56, although I think mom key d follows close behind because she's 40. So, you know I am 56. I'm just in really good shape. Uh, I work on my figure Some grand tubers who are the other grand tubers? You know black don't crack And also the black of the berry the sweet of the juice just look at Azura I can't wait for my fucking brown toggle bro Saying this is a white vtuber is hilarious Because no, it's actually really funny because if my shit that I say gets clipped out of context and like put somewhere It'll be so funny because then I could bait the community so fucking hard and be like and just say like the most out of pocket shit And then somebody who put me on blasts and be like, I can't believe people in this community are talking like this Like look at this agency vtuber. He's using these words and then I'm like Um, imagine the clout pass mode activate you you've activated my race card Oh God I am fucking funny as hell Uh Although it's funny. I like I definitely need to go outside Because I'm about to revoke my own card with how light skin I am right now. I'm so pale It's bad. Um If I was thinking after the storms pass, I think it's gonna be storming for a little bit But I'm gonna try to go to the beach. Um, I wanted my days off since I work from home I I somebody I asked twitter. Oh, what should I tell people I do for my job and somebody said a government agent So I think I might stick with that. She's funny in a racist. No, I'm not racist I love all everybody from all walks of life Trust me, uh, one of my best friend's dad is a very fucking racist person Uh It's so I'm not like them at all. So I'm like, that's my when I know if I start talking like him. I know I fucked up I'm only pretend my 1949 moment. Oh, I told my parents about that scene In fucking class of 09 my dad was laughing his ass off and my mom looked mortified. It was so fucking funny. Um But it was it was yeah, I'm not racist. This is something gonna raise No, I'm just I'm just silly. I'm just I'm a goof. I'm just a dark humor girl. I'm just uh, yeah It's not racist. If you hit everyone equally. Yeah, I do. I prefer animals. That sounds weird. Um I prefer, uh, my company of my cats um Doing anything fancy for pride month. No, I remember the last time I like actually did something for pride month I did a really cool, uh, because I used to be a makeup youtuber as well not a makeup youtuber I tried to do makeup Videos on youtube and on instagram. I did a really cute like pan flag Um, eye shadow. It came really nice came really nice um Why are we calling her racist? Because they're silly. Well, me you're in the way. Oh, baby. Come here. Come here. Hi, baby Why do you smell like my lotion? You smell like you got into my fucking lotion. What are you? Are you good? He was like that was high expression on his face Influencer she be must have been a time. Yeah, you know, I wore many hats when I was Going into content creation as a southern backman. I can tell you I'm not racist, but has preceded some of those wild shit um That reminds me of like that fucking vine Of that one girl who's like, I'm not racist, but 80 people But she's fucking loses it why lotion this is a cat People there's lube and lotion lotion like my body lotion. He probably knocked it over. It's probably fucking exploded all right My what should I call it? Um Uh bathroom He's someone's open hookups and then like he says something that I'm not racist. I will like any color hole I think my favorite thing people say is this like I have I'm not racist. I have a black friend I remember I remember somebody like one of My uh friends Like we were in a group. I think we're going to like the movies or something. I don't remember what the fuck we were seeing But one of them said that they're like I have a black friend and they pointed at me and I'm like, no man I don't count. I'm only half a black person Like you need you need to find another one to count as a full I'm like, no Need at least two. Mm-hmm You know two halves must make a hole and like it's funny because like I'm like the most americanized Like I'm not I didn't come from another country like my dad immigrated from Haiti um And but like not when he was older like when he was like five. So my dad is very americanized too and so people like think I'm like very like cultural this or that And like I can't like I've done my research because I you know, I owe it to myself to learn my culture But then like I have my white girl moments For sure for sure I honestly heard the term racism thrown around the media consumes so much it kind of losses. Yeah, and like I like I don't feel like like there's a lot of like races, but it's mostly like people that are fucking hateful And it doesn't it's like different. I don't know. I can't really explain it I got a half black friend Bro, I had a friend who's indian trade have asked me since I'm africa. Can I see the Bro My civilization he has to recognize you forgot how to speak curl. Yeah, my my my dad is my dad speaks curl, but like My grandmother says he has like an american accent when he speaks it Pass is not conferrable I Yeah, I honestly I'm telling you class of 09 educated me with the um Like white nationalism versus white supremacists and I was like, oh Okay, they both suck. What cool good to know the difference Um, but yeah, it was just this is interesting Why am I talking about this shit bro? Sometimes I'm like I I can't wait to get The lia fans because like then I can just be like no holds fucking bar because youtube is so I hate having to keep cut down my vods when I I'm just talking to you guys But I probably have to cut this vod down too Because I just I can't be say so But it's funny. I swear. I was more fucking say so when I was in india on twitch than I am now I don't even and I'm in an agency. What the fuck is wrong with me? Never the cause of it. I have much of an impact Never asked a woman her age never asked a man so I never asked she'd be to not edit a That's good When I get the upload notice I can't go I think I think you guys are a bad influence. It all started When I started going on the interwebs when I was first becoming a vtuber This is some not so savory sites Fuck you guys corrupt me different fans bring up topics maybe. Oh, yeah, actually. Yeah, that's a that's a pretty good point Uh, we have a different fan base. I have a different fan base than I did before Um, that's true like I know I I have seen like one or two of my past Like of rena's fans around but because of the constant I do now a lot of my fans don't watch me Which is totally fine. I accept it. It sucks, you know, it's sad, but you know, I totally get it. Um So I think yeah, it's it is a hundred percent a different fan base different questions different um Yeah Fans reflect the streamer that that makes me sound really bad Maybe we're just too submissive to stop holding from saying controversial stuff But like is it I'm thinking I'm like, do I really say controversial stuff? I don't Think like I feel like I don't know. I feel like I'm just real. I don't really think I'm controversial I find it weird that you're so open about your past life. Um Yeah, see not really. Um We're allowed to be open about our past life. It's fine. Um If I there's nothing against us to talk about it Strani said that when we debuted we can even just we can we can tell our fans that um Uh that we are in v alert all I did was post a meme on my My rena account when I was rena no way. Um Um But I didn't really feel the need to I had a small community I knew they would find me if they wanted to um, so yeah Don't have to pretend you didn't exist until the other yeah Not controversial but edgy I don't really think I'm edgy I don't even think I'm based look at fucking emmy emmy's way more base than I am you kidding me Oh my god, you exist before two weeks ago She entered one time. I think she changed grew up on it molded by the perversion there whole life. Yeah I never been I I literally Yes, like literally six months ago Actually, no not six months. It'll be a year because I was uh, I was a refling. I was an og refling. So that's a lie. Um Been on the grind for 56 years things getting too sensitive So you didn't tell your old community I posted it so like you know the lore um picture of like me Holding queen's hand as she's dying in a hospital bed Somebody who had figured out who I was When we uh did our voice reveals edited rena as queen in the bed Dying of sickness and me as she be holding her hand and it sent me so I just posted that And like like she's like passing the torch, but like it made perfect sense It was like rena's passing the torch to she be You know, I thought it was great So I'm like so I just posted that and everybody responded with lmao and like they thought I was hilarious And I shout out to that person who made that fucking meme I'm dying. Stop be boxing caption. That would have been funny. Um And yeah, like we're we're allowed to talk about this stuff. I'm very thankful for the fan base I had back then um And they knew how much I wanted to be an agency and they believed in me more than than I did And I thank them for that because I would not be here if it weren't for them I would have no audience. I had no one to stream to and but they gave me a chance Um, but yeah, where can I see that meme? Uh, you can't see it because I I nuked uh All of my past life stuff. So like you may notice that I um Went on an indefinite hiatus as rena Uh, I'll be honest with you. She's essentially graduated. I just did a definite hiatus because um Rina means a lot to me as she represents rena who is my cat Um, so I and rena is a seimees cat. So I wanted to I made a character after her because rena is my baby. Um, so that when rena passes on which she is older She's 14. It will happen eventually. I'm mentally prepared for that. Um, that she lives on With rena. I actually might just change rena's name to rena To be honest with you, but I will not be going back to rena. Um I will be she be I am she be she be is me. I am her We are each other. Um, some people Uh, presumed because I made her an indefinite hiatus that like they thought I was gonna go back And somebody mentioned that um, I had commissioned a lot of stuff like for a whole new fucking Like asset package and debut thing and model and everything for rena But then I was hired to be a lure so I can't use it And so as people saw posts of like my assets being in showcases and they're like, wow She's just planning on going back bro. I commissioned those back in fucking february chill out I'm not gonna be rena She is sleeping. She's good. She's fine I am here now with you guys. You are my little cotton booty holes my harem I am she be And I am here to stay. I'm not going anywhere Not she be she be. Yeah, I wish I'm doing heart in my hands, but you can't tell my hands look cute today. Um But yeah You guys are my little pock champs The fuck why are you so sweet? Uh, I can be sweet. I told you that I can be very sweet. I'm a very sweet and kind and caring person. I'm a fucking empathetic person Um, that's why I cry like a bitch half the time Because I just get so emotional because I feel so deeply and I love so deeply Um, vtuber's teaching ideas is like a crazy personality disorder. I'll be honest with you like That's what I love about being a vtuber is that you have so many possibilities Um, like I if I wanted to for my 2.0. I could just be like, I'm no longer a rabbit. I'm a slug girl I'm a slime girl. Um, I'm the slime girl. I wanted gen two Uh, like when you have the money to do so the support the right artists the assets like you can be who you want And that's what I love about vtubing. I was so put in a box as a flash streamer. Um, when I was one and as a It's just so fun to play around as a vtuber Um, I can be anyone I can I can it's it's just it's honestly great Slime bunny girl the change you want to see Thank goodness. I'm here for she be intended to stick around I'll thin down around the tears So it's like hearing all yeah guys. I'm not I'm not going anywhere like don't worry I am here Even if the vealur somehow fell off the face of the fucking earth. I will be here Uh, I am just like strawney. We are here till the fucking end like don't shoot So when you're going vr chat, uh, I don't know I vr chat makes me motion sick Even with the same model. I've already done some great stuff a fanfic reading stream was incredible. Yeah, exactly Like that was really fun and I'm doing that next week too Invest in your oh she so she doesn't have to go anywhere This is why we need a crying harlot emo. Oh Damn, I should have I should have come because I just put in a request For more emotes so Um, although I don't know if you did know me as rina you Know that I one of my famous emotes that was used very often by multiple people was my crying emo So I am I did commission that as she be My what the fuck is going on emo Because that that that that's that's always been a funny meme It's better to invest in oh she rather than crypto. Yeah, that's true. You know what you you know what you're getting you know your returns Said it before she because she put the shrug model in still watch that'd be fucking funny Know if any spicy arts still exist of Cheebie Yeah Yeah, um or rina. I know there is spicy art of rina Um, I even I commissioned spicy art of rina for one of my previous donathan That I did for fias medical bills Um when I was rina and I it's still I again I commissioned that in fucking march and it's not there So I feel really fucking bad about that Uh, I wondering if my The skeb artist goes to me for that which sucks I'm gonna buy nfts. No bad for the environment Um And they're also fucking waste of money. You can't do shit with them I'm just gonna copy paste your fucking nft invest in a she be coin Blind bunny. Yeah, slight money would actually be pretty cool No, because I'm a element now anatomy kind of as you took me back a little. Yeah, some people like as I've I've I've Did that with rina too They're limited to emotes is that a limit only and not your best in the art for it. Um I think there is like a limit for emotes like on youtube I again, I'm not I'm not far super familiar with youtube's YouTube's With youtube and their policy on how many emotes you can have I Like so I have like I already have more than the four that you're using um Like I I have a crying one. I have some other ones Uh, and then I got 10 more that I'm that um I commissioned and so I don't so I'm assuming I can have around like 15 maybe 20. I don't know. Yeah, there's no 17. Yeah Um I want to say like 50 ish. Yeah. Oh, okay Well, where are they? I don't know like I commissioned. Well, oh the ones we I we just commissioned our emotes like more emotes Um, the other ones. I don't know why they're all not added there. Again. I don't know how youtube works I don't meant manager set up account. So I don't know. I don't know if I can know um You can put bttv on youtube. Oh, okay Are there any plans for management yourself? I'm making a discord server for you vealer as a whole now that you mentioned emotes and stuff You can't there's a notification server Um, just for our And everybody's safety. We're not gonna have a personal server that we frequent. Um, I know there's like fan servers and stuff and that's cool and all Which also the people who run the fan server if you're watching can you please change it to not look like our official Fucking twitter. I will get notifications if you like my stuff and I think it's our official twitter, but it's not Um, make it make your own fucking logo. Um Yeah, just because like we don't need groomer cords We don't need people getting like feeling like they're being favored or the fuck like Jesus I don't feel like dealing with that shit. It's so much. You don't need that Um, I know you guys want to hang out with us, but you can hang out with me right now I'm talking to you face to face Anime girl to titties to viewer, you know I think it's I think it's better this way for everyone. We don't we don't need that. Um, you know, trust me I would love to be In a discord with everybody, but and I know I would behave. It's just how some people act Uh in a discord when there is a talent in there, um Sometimes they uh Because they're in closer proximity to the the talent they They feel like they're owed something and could like Spam them harass them blah blah blah blah and like I don't feel like fucking dealing with that Management doesn't feel like fucking dealing with that. Um Vibes can really fucking weird. Yeah, like I've seen I've been in discords where those talents are there And it's kind of a fucking shit show. So I think it's better like Yeah Yeah She doesn't want to talk to us. She hates this. No, no, god, like I would talk to you all the time Like I literally fucking quit my job so I could be with you more Like Come on be for real. Um, I'm tempted to I'm thinking about making um I've seen other streamers do this where they add their, uh Actually, maybe that's not the best idea. I'd have to ask management about it But I've seen people add their schedule as a video and they'll like give updates in that pre chat from time to time Um, but yeah, because you know, there's there's a there's a line you can't Like you have to be careful and like have a line you can't cross Just so people don't get hurt. Like I don't want people to be hurt Um, like I know I see you was very upset. Um, because somebody hurt her feelings And I don't want anybody else to feel that way viewer or talent. So It's sometimes we got to do stuff that protects our mental health Um, but yeah, like, you know, you see me pop into like preach out a couple times Um, but yeah, I was thinking about a free chat. I'd have to ask management though. Um, but yeah The other girls are free to Reach out like that. Yeah, does she do it like in the video of that day or does she have like an actual thing? Someone made the girls cry and pop in the trunk No, yes. No someone. Yeah I Keep yeah, well like I'll I'll keep you close like again, like you guys said chart reflect streamer. Um I know my boundaries. I would tell you guys if you ever I ever thought you guys crossed them Um But you guys are very well behaved. I don't feel any sort of way for that Oh, I mean as a schedule free chat. Oh, okay Wait, huh Why didn't Was I supposed to do that? Why am I so fucking dumb? Oh gurra's streaming Her 3d bird I'm oh guys I'm overlapping gurra. I might have to end stream Jesus fuck Wait Why the oh, I'm like, why did Amy just mention me as I'm talking to her? She just tagged me because she she blew up on the tweeters Damn, what the fuck she did blow up on the tweeters Hey, she caught up to me. Yay. Let's fucking go I was hoping the girls would fucking catch up to me in the So awkward having so many people in my fucking old. Um She'll probably pass me soon enough Where is it? Where is her? I can't Because then I want to see how she set it up so I can replicate it Just creeping on your account. Amy just creeping on your account Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. Amy It's okay. Just accept it. Amy. Where the fuck is it? Where is it? Where is it? I don't see that I don't see the free chat. Oh, I found it That's cool. Oh schedule and free chat.

Yeah, okay Oh, she be do you think you could take her on a fight if you had to be her ass Excuse me. I would not harm that shark. Are you kidding me? I would treat that shark as a princess mostly because I'm scared of hollow fans I'll give you an activity streaming tomorrow in the collab. Is it tomorrow? Yes I am in the collab. It's not on my schedule, but I'm there What if you had to no? I got the majority of the vtuber rabbit hole last year via indy so I learned to follow away after I'm like it I It's very interesting to me where people find like Agencies or indies before they do the big names. It's but I've noticed that happening a lot more often um But yeah I'm valid Hard girl the sush shark kid. She's not sush. She's a shark It's the 20th teams. I don't again. I don't remember where I am half the time Girl is the first vtuber I watched. Um, yeah, the first vtuber I watched was kazuna ai And then I watched co-amigo, but I never really considered her a vtuber. Um Let's see. Who else did I watch? And I watched a little bit of hollow. I would watch polymyth naturally. Um, I watched kiara And then I had to stop myself from falling in love with shiwari Um, listen, I love messy manhara looking types If we had a goth chick like that and gen 2 I would die. Um Let's see. Yeah, and then I and then I just watched a lot of agency vtubers like smaller agencies. So like idol um Pixel link and projects like I watch Yeah Watched a little bit of vrevery like rana. She was cool. Just sucks because I really fucking graduated I Miss isn't that mercy? No, she's not goth I don't think mercy doesn't look goth to me. She says I'm thinking. Yeah, no See me a while just chatting started chatting with you there though. Yeah, I feel that Which one is your oh sheet? I don't have to tell you I don't have to tell you any of my oh sheets are for me to know And I hold them close to my heart Or not for anybody else Corony What can I click? Dory, gen 2, mercy would be mad. Oh, I thought you said mercy would be mad if that happened.

Oh, she Like why do you guys need to know who my oh she is? They're not like me at all that's for sure They're very talented very talented. Um I would watch we cheaper highlights from time to time and never got into them until you guys debut Yeah, yeah, I like I love watching me two bird debuts Quick But you got like they're not it's not like they're not a popular person like they're very well known Nova's still fun of you ever again Feel bad for the you every girls Hope they bounce back Can I tell you my oh, yeah, you guys can tell me your oh, she's oh wait, are you gonna say fucking me? And I'll honestly be a lair is the first group to pull me off a hollow plant I see some words seems like I missed out on some good time staying there for so long You know, but it's like it's cool to prevent venture out because like again, I feel like It's it's a lot more intimate being In a smaller um agency like chat like you can see you can interact with each other You probably recognize each other's names. Uh, I can talk to you. I recognize a lot of you It's a nice small little chat and we're hanging out She used my kamiyoshi. God damn that just weird like it just doesn't make any sense to me that people like me that much to call me their kamiyoshi and I yeah, I don't even know what to say besides thank you because I just never thought Like being like when I was indian never thought anybody would ever tell me that Make more 200 rather than 2000. Yeah, I like having small chat I only remember you because you keep saying you lost your job and then you went to the other girl's chat and said you lost your job And I was like, why are you telling everybody? And remember this there's a saying move in silence bro make money moves move in silence She don't yeah, and I notice you on other girls chats too. Don't you forget More of a casual vtuber fan and watch the content like and the first thing I enjoy don't really have an oshi Yeah, exactly. Yeah, like I'm the same way Except like there's someone just like I watch the most and that's who I call my oshi He lost a new job each time move in silence like lasagna Like the gene lasagna Like the end of lasagna Yeah, identifying you in maros. Oh 100% they'll become a loved and respected figure in the industry. That's very sweet and Honestly, that's the goal. I want I want to be I want to have the same I don't it sounds really fucking pretentious when I say this but like I really want that Pull that like the big some of the big twitch indies do or like Like I just I want to be the person that like everybody Knows is like cool and chill and you could talk to me and hang out and we can always collab and um And just like just have a bunch of fucking friends. Like that's all I want. I just want a bunch of fucking friends um In the industry it would be cool just to like kind of have that sort of Like I don't want to be as famous as iron mouse, but like have a sort of like air about me, you know Like tomah. Yeah Tomah's cool. I love tomah. She sends me tiktoks all the time. I can't keep up with all the tiktok. She sends me I Knew at a place here. I saw a robot taking the debut. Uh, yeah, I need to rewatch I was thinking that because I was cleaning and I was like I found my robotech discs And my dad let me and I'm like oh, I need I should rewatch these Um, I haven't watched robotech in a very long time I already found your cool. So I think you're getting there. Thanks Uh, tomah is a tiger. Oh, no, that's uh, toto. Tomah is um a monkey little monkey. Yeah Oh, yeah, she'd be a knower. Yeah, that's what I want. And yeah, like I've said this before you're watching the hollow justice debut tomorrow Probably I usually wait for them to debut Ayo Oh, thanks. What the fuck dude? You didn't have to do that Thank you Can we get some can we get some chads in the chat for doki? How they am? Oh Very nice. Thank you so much. I appreciate that so much. I hope so. I want to make you guys proud. I want to be I want to be the best for you for you guys and I want to be the best for the community You know, I want to I want to make a difference And I know on the way there I'll make mistakes. I'll learn I'll grow and all that stuff Fia, what are you doing? She's scratching my chair. But yeah, you know, I want to do that um Again, my only fear is that people won't want to spend time with the girls and vealer and myself because of the content we do We're already feeling it. Um for some things like I really want to be friend people and other agencies, but I I know that because of who we are who strani was that You know, we might not be afforded some friendships, but yeah It is what it is uh, it's water under the bridge for all of us, but This sucks You know, I'm that type of person who I want to be friends with everybody Because I have a desire to be liked Yeah, yeah, it's just the nature of business. This is the nature of agencies um, it's the nature of you know Some people seeing us like it was a competition, although I don't really see it that way like they were like, oh My melody better my melody Uh project melody better watch out for realer. No girl. I just want to learn from her. Are you kidding me? This is like I ain't competition to fucking project melody. No I don't do half the shit she does. I like to learn how she does her stuff though That'd be fucking cool and with con tail VA and all the girls from twitch playing um He's a wild take a while to get on the fucking level, you know The only thing that we're doing differently is that we just have naughty ASMR and we say the the quiet shit out loud Most of the girl like yeah, that's yeah And I'm happy because I thought there was some That wouldn't like us, but they they started interacting with us now. So I'm hopeful I Thank you friends. Did you make you'll be loyal? I hope so I don't I'm not again. I said I'm the type of person like if something's wrong Like I'll I'll confront somebody so because I hate drama. I just I just want people to be happy I just want everybody to be okay and be happy and be friends And that's why like I I asked like my gen mates a lot of questions annoyingly like how they're feeling how they're doing um, because I just want to make sure we're all on the same page because uh, I just want to make sure that they're okay and Like everybody's doing all right because I care about them. I care about how they're feeling how their mental health is Um, you had your fill of trauma there. Yeah, exactly. Yeah being a commentator was very stressful it was I can't even explain to you how stressful it was just like the hate um The shit that I went through dealing with people And it's funny because now I get to see them get karma now that are in the con that were in the commentary community And it's it's very nice to see it People who treated me like shit, um Just for being a girl trying to do shit uh Should be doing wellness checks I do though like I'm like I did that at my job too before I left Like I would check in with everybody and be like, hey, how are you doing? Or if somebody seemed down I'm like tell me what's up and they're just like I'm fine. I'm like don't fucking lie to me When you get bigger friends aren't just friends business relationship from what I've heard But like I don't want that if like I don't I don't see collabs as like a business transaction Unless they explicitly say this is a business transaction um, I will probably only collab with people that I like I am acquaintances with or I am on friendly terms or I do consider my friends or my best friends um Because like I want to hang out with you. I don't want anything from you You know like I don't I'm not doing this For like monetary gain or popularity like if If a big ass vtuber was like, hey, you want to hang out I'd mostly be fucking sides because this person wants to hang out with me I don't care about their audience size like and same thing for me Like I don't care if you have only five people watching you if I know you're cool. I watch your streams. I've you know like I'll hang out with you. Like, you know, like I'm not gonna let that stand in the way It isn't a business transaction to me But again, I respect the people who do believe that like I'm not gonna be like oh my god. You're just a bitch. No, that's stupid Everybody's entitled to like how they go about things. Um If I were to to collab with like some girls from other agency and they're like We're doing this because management told us to I'd be like ow, but okay Let's then I'll try to have the best fun that I can. I don't that's not hasn't happened So I don't think that's happened. It has not happened, but like it's just this is the hypothetical. Um It's time to start streaming so Um, am I fine? Um I'm okay Like again, I'm very honest with you guys. So like I've been in a little bit of pain for my fibro I've had a couple headaches um It's been tough Leaving my job. I don't really think it's settled in yet because I've been there for almost six years that job meant so much to me and Saying goodbye to people was hard. I'm surprised I didn't cry. Um It I'm not good with change and what worries me the most is I tend to get really isolated And so I was only going back to work So that I wouldn't isolate myself and self isolate because I tend to do that when I'm I'm feeling down um but I realized I was just feeling more tortured being there like I was Really starting to resent the work I was doing Um, but otherwise I'm fine like Yeah, like I miss hanging out my parents. I need to go see them. I did hang out with them a couple days ago But yeah, I need to hang out with my friends. I was supposed to hang out with Salem, but I didn't feel good. Um I needed to sleep I didn't go over her house And then like so yeah, my goals are really just to leave my house Because I tend I like I have been agoraphobic in the past where I didn't leave my house for six months And that wasn't good for me. It really wasn't it's not good for anybody humans humans are Humans are pack creatures. We need to talk to we're very we need to hang out with other people And that's I like I V-Jubing does give me energy because I can talk to you guys But sometimes it's good to be face-to-face with people, you know Um I Left my old job the first week was just a haze. It's up the best that we're had in previous eight years Uh for me, I've haven't I've been sleeping like fucking shit I've only been sleeping a couple hours Uh I can't stay asleep. I have really fucking weird dreams Um, and I'm a very lucid dreamer so I remember every fucking dream I have. Um Yeah, it's just I'm in a weird state. I'm just I just feel I just feel off You know mercury's and Gatorade. No, I have no idea fucking retreat mercury's and retrograde. Um It's weird dreams. No, not the not the fun dreams. I have had a couple though Sorry, I'm stretching. Um Let me make a day and just go outside Yeah, and like that's why like it took so much energy from me just to fucking go to the grocery store today That's why I know that like I need to be outside more. Um, also it was just really hard carrying everything up I've it I it's hard to carry groceries several flights um And then I had to drag my bed frame upstairs and that shit is probably like fucking 50 pounds and And I swear every time I picked up picked it up. I was getting abs and really buff And then yeah, yeah, and even in terms of like streaming stuff. Um It's it's a new thing to have so many eyes on me. I'm used to having like a concurrent viewership of Like 30 people like max 50 I remember on my debut when I debuted as Rena with my little chibi model I got rated with 200 people and I will chat myself and now I have a concurrent viewership of that. So it's very It's very weird adjusting to it the amount of attention that I get um I'm used to kind of passing under the radar and kind of being the support in the shadows type Like I I'm always there to like lend a helping hand but to be on the forefront It's very interesting. It's a very new experience to me. I think I'm handling it. Okay The first week was a little bit rocky. Um, you know, I said some stupid shit Uh, oh my god, Rena. What the fuck Rena? Can you go lay in your bed? Please? Okay. Well, never mind. Ow. We just stepped on my tit. Thanks. I love that Thank you for stomping on my nipple Um mirror about me here and I'm happy. Oh, that's nice. Mara is such a sweetheart Me and my plus girls are such sweethearts. We have a collab with them next week spoiler. Um, can't wait uh But yeah, now you're the protagonist it's like Literally though, it's like I'm like, oh Joining the alert would never happen to me because that's like a dream come true and like that would be a fairy tale and A lot of my problems would be solved if this happened and then it happened and doesn't feel real still like it feels Like I'm gonna dream and I'm gonna wake up and Be disappointed that I'm still stuck at my fucking job But then I pinch myself and I have to remember that I'm here As we discover you may plus they're pretty cool. Yeah, they're so sweet They deserve a lot more Viewership than they do like they they do. They're so talented. They're so funny Most is a fucking right Um, should have been me not him I love you. Oh fucking where'd you come from bitch? She's just coming out of nowhere She's just like me you my plus mention Um, I don't know you too and I've been here. Oh, yeah, I we talked like 20 minutes ago. You just lurking. She's lurking Um, yeah, the most uh, the most of sliding in my dm. She's like, hey, you want to be friends and I'm like, yeah, bitch I love that shit. That's my favorite um She's cool as hell Please don't wake up. We'll stop existing Hey, most of her bad mouth. Thank you. Um Yeah, bad mouth thing about how much of a bad bitch you are Uh, we all the girls are sweet. Um Yeah, it's just it's and then also like dealing with hate has been interesting um as a vtuber It is a lot more manageable because as a commentator, I was like hit every day with that shit. So it was pretty desensitized um, and I think I've learned over time to handle hate better um But then sometimes I'm like, I do get baited and I respond to trolls like I'll admit that I can be stupid like that sometimes Um, mostly because I'm trying to be out of the goodness of my heart answer like an on what I think is an honest question when it isn't um or or a Yeah, or um respond to something that I think is genuine, but A genuine critique, but then I'm like, oh wait, no, it's not my back is cheap um Yeah, I just Hmm Like I'm learning not like when I don't like something I don't need to acknowledge it When something bothers me don't want to just block and move on. That's it's really interesting We're stroding your chat. That's pretty good Yeah, don't feed the trolls. Yeah, and it's like because I'm like I'm a little fucking brat and bitch sometimes sometimes I'll bait the trolls I've done that before and I'm like Um, what I did that before is Rina and I'm like, oh fuck should have done that But you live you learn and you live whatever the fuck you make mistakes that you fucking learned from them um and that's what I think like What we do as a company it's like we'll make like a small mistake and then we'll adjust accordingly um And we haven't made a lot of those But I can't wait to see how we'll grow. I think we have a We'll be learning a lot at least as a company because I've never worked in a group as a company before like an agency um And of course I've worked in many groups like and I've managed teams when I was in the training when I was in my job um So it's it's interesting to kind of I really like just being able to support scrawny in her dream um And also be able to make my own content and like just like her giving me the green light on things and projects that I want To do has been really cool. Um, I don't know if any of the girls have anything planned But like I would support them if they did something and they asked me to be a part of it or they just wanted support So it's it's it's nice. It's it is really nice I'm learning to let things go. Yeah, like I don't hold on to things I realize uh, I think that's a skill I have I I don't hold grudges um Yeah, pretty optimistic about people there. Yeah, me too scrawny stream is my dream exactly exactly I really think viewers gonna be big one day. Yeah I can't wait till we like Like I want to be the V show joe for whores. Like I want to be like I want to just be able to like nepo Scout fucking huge lude tubers and be like come be a whore with us Be fucking hilarious Um, but yeah, like I know scrawny has a lot planned for us deals sponsorships She's she literally wants the best for us and I couldn't ask for a better mom A better vtuber mom uh The pop-up and pop cherries. Oh god, but um Yeah, it's just It's really cool. I'm very thankful It's really nice hanging out with you guys Too small be a lure be the whole live of vtuber lude tubers I don't want that though. Like I don't want to be whole live of lude tubers Um Yeah I'm trying to throw cops caught until vk. That'd be cool Be like it was her she was queen in my lure Um I don't want to be that big because I was thinking about it because I was just like, okay Like what if um And don't take this the wrong way this hypothetical that I thought of it was only because the girl the the Debuts popped up that I thought of this and not in a negative way. Just like how would I handle it? I'm like, okay. Let's say in like four years For three years velar um Ended operations I'm like Would I try to get in the hall alive? No One because the content I make two because of all the eyes on me uh three I don't think I'm entertaining enough and like I don't I don't know. I just like being small. I just like I that's why I hope velar lasts forever because I just want it I don't know how to explain it, but I hope you guys like understand what I'm saying. It wasn't it's not I don't care about the money Either that's not a motivation. It's nice. It's an added perk like but I For me Being a streamer was my passion into what makes brings me joy and makes me happy if I and then I was So fucking miserable when I wasn't streaming for the last few years It was so fucking shitty. I realized how much I missed it when I when I was rena um when I became When I did my first stream as rena, I realized how much I missed it and then when I had to be Quiet and be underground for a couple of months Uh while I was transforming into my ultimate form shiwi I was literally dying inside because I missed talking to my community. I missed talking to people. I missed making stuff Because uh, like I had so many plans and I'm like, oh my god. Like I just wanted to get shit done. Um It was a core profile. No, no, no. I was never in an agency before this. Uh, I was indy. I was a twitch indy Very small twitch indy um I do and I already said this stream I caught until VA collab would go hard. Yes, it would I don't know if she would want to talk to me though Again, I'm so small Oh, I'm gonna tell you when you're for five hours. Has it been five hours or shit? I get it. We could be more comfy this way and it gives you flexibility. Yeah The dichotomy between wanting success and wanting a nice small community. Yeah Like I could always get a job like Worst comes to worst. I could get a job if like I wasn't making enough streaming and like that's fine I'm up as long as I get to stream. That's all I care about She loves us. I do. I'll say it. I love you guys. I love streaming Fuck you Bitch Don't let it get to your head Contale would simp for you on god. I highly doubt that I'd be simping for her Overgrowth with the selfish part of me hopes. Oh you guys fucking talk her so fast. Um, it's the most like this intimate vibes are immaculate Yeah And like yeah, that's why like I've seen a lot of people have that same sentiment Like they want us to be successful, but they want you want to get keep us a little and so I totally understand that Um, but then Then you think and I know you guys think this like why would I want to stop somebody else from experiencing what I'm experiencing right now? What if she helps somebody or what if like She brings a smile to somebody having a bad day. That's what I want you to remember when you you think like that um Like what if we bring so much change to the vtuber community then another Agency pops up that does similar content to ours and you find you're The fucking love of your life in comey in comeyoshi and that one or like what if like because so many so many things can happen like you can branch and you know all that Still keeping my ego in check. Don't worry Uh intimate chats of the soul. So yeah I like about vtuber is the chat interaction, which is why I like indie so much. Yeah, I loved I liked I like streaming Because I love doing chat interaction. That's why I'm frustrated with youtube because it's it's hard to do a lot of chat interaction That's my like channel points on twitch um Have a plan make it easy on her to destroy a thing yeah I did like um I want to be part of honey kins Like murder mystery thing that she has going she needs like 15 vtubers for it. So I was like, please please um Yeah, I like I'm afraid to ask people to hang out because I don't want to seem like I'm clout chasing because I just It's just that now that I'm an agency vtuber with a brand People are more likely to say yes because if I was a fucking indie No one would say yes to hanging out with me I don't want to hang out because I want popularity. I just want to hang out because I think your content's cool So I'm like, oh if I slide into a k like so and so's dms. Are they gonna think I'm a clout chasing leechy bitch? I'm like, I hope not I just want to hang out with you because I think you you and your content is cool Felt yeah um I don't yeah, I just don't want I want to make connections, but it's it's it's it that's what holds me back Um, and then when I feel a little bit stupid when like someone doesn't respond and I know they've seen it But I'm like, hey, it's it is what it is. Like I can't Change how they feel if like they're like, oh, I don't like her. She's kind of like and she's fucking Because I know like another thing people are like, um, some people are put off about I've heard somebody say that um My model makes them uncomfortable, which makes me kind of sad But I understand because like if you're not into bdsm and I have a fucking ball gag as a choker and Uh shabari ropes and my boobs are a fucking huge, you know um And some people don't like a very sexualized. Why am I so small because I'm because I'm fucking Because I'm leaning back Here I'll lean I'll lean nice and close to you. I'm so short I'm like trying to do this and lean but also like move myself up So I can like yeah, okay, that's a little bit better. Um Oh, this is scared of the drills Reach out just bring a plant. Yeah here with the um big bobs scare you. Oh, well stay away from big bobs so short Yeah, I think my model is amazing too. Like when I saw it the first time I was like my mouth fucking dropped I wish I was on a video call with strawnee because then she would have been laughing at me. Um, What do you mean that is inside? I'm scared you were personalities. I don't know maybe that's why that's why I'm like I debate so often if I should really reel myself in Because I don't want to put people off Um These people just want to hang out through the ones to be valid. Yeah, that's why I fucking love that you may plus girls so much Because they gave us a chance, you know They're like, yeah Um, and I know like sponsored watch alongs don't uh mean anything when it comes to like lasting relationships in the v2 Bing community, but we were turned down by a lot of agencies. Um for that And I can say that strawnee's already fucking talked about it. Um, but you may plus was like yeah And like it was really fucking cool of them to accept Because we're nobody's yeah, we have a little bit of pull because of just like the content we make but We're still a brand risk being not safe for work. That's why Feel silly when there's so many skimpy jiggly models of the gags curious people. Yeah, yeah, you know, I think I Yeah, I I feel like I I think In like a couple months will be a little bit more settled in. We love you girls. We love you too Um before mariah coming in college too Honestly, yeah, like I was chatting in rem's chat. Um, I've been like making funny jokes with uh, nova So like I'm like they're the v4 mariah girls are so fucking cool to me to be honest, uh, their debuts Honestly blew me out of the fucking water like all like all their debuts so far and before mariah Um have blew me out of the water Um, I remember watching serena's the first time when they actually made the company Her singing voice was amazing. I I Was so amazed by it and then just the newer girls their debuts are so creative They're such a creative group. Um, they're such a such a nice bunch of people um And the mythos girls are also you have fucking facade and rated me the other day and I was like, oh shit, okay That's cool and that And that like and I always see like as a raid a raid as like a little olive branch like hey, please like I like you. I want to send my My viewers to you and I always appreciate that Um, I miss abby kiddo. Oh, yeah same she It's a real bummer, but I'm proud of her. Um, because she Got an opportunity, but she was honestly doing things that a lot of people did not do in the community in terms of skits Um, and just her format and I thought that was very unique about her Uh, and then yeah her and biscotti um Very talented people, but you know when life affords you Amazing opportunities. You gotta you gotta get them and it's amazing that brave group allows them to do so so The scientist debut was insanely. You're not to the yes. Like I was like, what the fuck is this? This is crazy Um, yeah, raids raids are nice. The the redirects are cool I'm sorry with costume for the lore moment. Remind me of the moment from the Um, yeah, I was laughing at uh, alias is v2 apology thing. I was dying at that actually that was really funny. Um Came in from that raid. Oh, okay. That's funny. That's cool Sounds like she found a little path into comedy. Yeah, I mean, I I generally I'm wondering what she got into like it It for her to leave, but you know It's very interesting I mean it was and also like she was so great to her portuguese fan base her brazilian fan base. I really think um, she really paved the way for um Brazilian vtubers Oh Yeah, I hope I hope yeah, I hope the girls are okay. Um in her leaving And I just yeah, I just wonder what will be next for a lot of the smaller agencies in the community um like Yeah, pixeling just debuted around the same time as us um What was it isn't like idle doing another gen or um, or was that or did I see that in a dream? I can't remember. Um I know they did like uh idle. Yes, which was really fucking cool I'm brazilian. That was so cool. Yeah, like she she always I always appreciated that she always did her her tweets in english and in portuguese I'll on core. Yeah Yeah, no not on core. Uh, the gen three. Yes the gen three. Okay. I'm not I'm not going insane Uh, so I I look forward to their debuts, too I'll be a little shiblit Shiblit. I like that. I should have called you my shiblits Sounds like shitlits Sounds like cheek lays cheeklets cheek lays You may know one day she has a recognizable voice. Oh, you know, she definitely does um She fucking Imagine she shows up in fucking holo. Holy That's like the chaser. I would lose my fucking mind. Um Same brain so yeah Me and mercy say to share the same brain cells so often Like I think it's like so many times we've like gone to Like message each other and we're like, oh shit wait and because like I was about to talk to you And then like we'll talk about like the same thing at the same time In the our journal part of the discord and we're just like People with theorizing about holo and it happens. It'll be so reactive like live tweeting. Yeah Yeah, um, I kind of feel like with one of them being a really former high profile um Artist in indie I feel like That this Honestly, this has started happening a couple months ago though. Everybody's kind of been talking about pls um I feel like going forward people be able to talk more freely about them Because those connections just don't go away, you know Uh, if when you're like very well known people recognize your voice You have a lot of friends. It's yeah, it's hard to be like Of course like n da's it gives this and you can only you can share so much Oh, you can only share so much and that's fine, but I feel like That That will change and I don't think that's because of us. That's it's already been the in the In the works and the v2 being community that taboo kind of Not being a thing anymore, but I think like we're one of the first groups to normalize it Which is cool PLs often have the same save some corporates. Yeah, exactly. Like I know Usually like people in the new idol wave are probably gonna be bill I already know that we have recently graduated vice versa Because you know v2 being community tends to recycle their Fucking talents. Um, I think v for morai Is one of the more recent ones where there are people that I don't know. I didn't know about before Or some but and I'm very thankful for strongy giving us a chance because I know I was a nobody Zura was very small I see was very small uh, so And mercy was like a little like medium-sized and um, I mean was larger, but uh, like she Gave us a chance and when she did see big names applying. So I appreciated that a bunch Um, because I I never thought I was going to break into the industry because People were kind of just going through the same You know jump and jive of getting the same talents over and over if someone graduates just moves to another company And I'm like am I ever What is what is going to set me apart? And let get me in especially if there's nepotism people just hire their friends. So It was it was very I After if I didn't get into velar, I probably wasn't gonna apply to any more companies anymore Um, I was probably just gonna focus on being indie. So I'm very happy that I'm here Mm-hmm cynical. Yeah, but Be a bit cynical, but it's like when you see a pattern And it's it becomes a habit like what else can you think, you know Not that I like fault the people in the industry for that It's better to you like you know what you're investing in and you know how somebody acts and they already have a good track record in history Why would in experience? Why would you not hire them? Like that's it's to be a stupid Businesses and not to why would I take a risk on some random nobody from twitch? um That doesn't have a lot of content creation under the belt um Where someone who's an agency for two years recently left like I It's an it's a no-brainer. So I don't I don't blame it at all But then there's people like strani who want to you know develop talent And take chance and she had faith in us and I appreciate her immensely for that immensely Did Amy give a lot of I don't know you'd have to ask her that Yeah, you'd have to ask her that I I don't know and I um Yeah, I'll be honest with you. I don't know a lot of the other girls motivations for applying um My motivation again was I wanted It wasn't really for me. I just wanted to support Strani and I know I can be a good entertainer and yapper, you know, um And Yeah, I just I just wanted to support her I wanted to make change in the community and I saw her as a force for change and I wanted to support support that Um as for the other girl. Yeah, I have no idea what their motivations were for joining Maybe they wanted to do more adult content. Maybe they wanted to grow their audience. Maybe they wanted a brand Um, maybe they wanted more support. I think yeah, I feel like for some of them. It's probably like support um for projects and stuff so Glad you're here since detail kind of directed me to be alert. Yeah, it's like a yes detail has been really sweet She's given us a bunch of shout outs that collab with her was really cool um I think I want to be a part of a group that too. Um, I feel I think I'm I forget somebody one of the girls did mention that like I just wanted to be a part of a group And I can't remember who it was, but I know that was definitely a part of somebody's motivation um Amy, yeah She is but like let's not talk about her stuff. Um, just because it's not my place to speak on it Um, I'll talk about mine, but I won't talk about the other girls because it's not my place. It's not it's I don't have any right to talk about it Uh, scrawny knows how to pick them. It seems she does so she has an eye for for talent Um, yeah She beats literally sorrow. I think more important than the size of the proof There's a work ethic showing that you the library consistent work is reassuring that it lasts Yeah, that's why scrawny was a little bit confused because she's like, how do you know so much and do so much? But you've only been around for six months and then I explained to her in my interview That I technically was around longer than that and I had more content creation on my belt. I just applied with this version of myself, um Although again the version before My past life was just me and the flesh. So there's no point doesn't make sense to apply as my flesh version um And I was very deter I in my audition video. I just kind of expressed how Determined I was to help in just how much I would be a hard worker. I didn't do some people People asked like did you how did you like what sexual thing did you do to get in? I didn't do anything remotely naughty besides be like like make a silly like joke I just read I um I just introduced myself played some clips Uh, I read all the characters voice lines and different voices that I do and then Because I I I didn't really have a set person That I wanted to be in the company. So I trusted strongy to cast me for the right role and I think she did um It's funny. I kind of knew I would be ropes like I looking at the silhouette I was immediately attracted to it I thought I was going to be cast as like I see to be honest with you because of my past life, but um But I I just fucking knew deep down. It's really weird Like for the long stream, she'd be yeah, of course. I mean I said that not sure if she's the only one Context I don't know it. Um, yeah talk to him if you want to know 100% I don't even really hate cold She be jorked it. Yeah, I jorked it She has a lollip because I used to be a lolly Does he know? People think your auditions was poor. Yeah, which makes me laugh because literally I'll tell you what I did in my audition I introduced myself I played one clip I continued to introduce myself. I played another funny clip I continued to introduce myself. I played an asmr clip Um, that's what they do I talked I did some voice acting And then I told my commitment to be a lure and that was literally it That was literally the audition No, no, yeah, I didn't do any Mongolian throat singing. I was made I made sure to keep that away. I didn't do any yodeling Don't make jokes aside. I think you fit her perfectly. Yeah What sassy thing did you do bro joining a corpo even spice seems exactly I was very professional um in my Uh audition video and I also was very professional for my interview because I didn't know if I was interviewing Um, who I was interviewing for who I was interviewing with um Because I didn't think it would be strong. I thought it would be just the management management team But it was actually just her telling me. Oh, yeah, you were our first choice. You saw you. Here's your model. You made it in Sign this nda And read the contract and let us know You have a week to do it Uh, yeah, she gave us a long time to look over the contract if we um Tell like a lawyer look at it and stuff Um, which was very nice of her. She was very patient. Um I don't know if I'm allowed to say that but I just did so I think I think that's fine Um, how hard did you would fit it? I would do that was so hard. Um You didn't split and no, I didn't spit in sharny's mouth. Um, but yeah, it was one interview Uh, they're always reviewed contracts. Yeah, exactly. Um Yeah, it was just one interview She was really nice. I had prepared like a whole thing Like questions to ask how to respond um Very professional I even like dressed up did my makeup in case she wanted to do like a video call and then I realized yeah, it was just a normal way to go. Um But yeah How was the couch Always a good sign when your player encourages you to fully examine your contract. Oh, yeah, she was very like, please look at it Like please make sure this is what you want. Um, I read it over multiple times it She all says that her and a lawyer did a good job writing something up I'm not allowed to say that I've read I had time to read my I don't know. I don't know if this shit works You know hard it is for me to keep secrets That's why I'm like, if any of you guys have any surprises, don't fucking tell me because we'll tell everyone You know how hard it was just not say that I was she be it was so hard for me I was dying. I changed the password on my account to my twitter I had my friend change it and not tell me So I couldn't get back in so I could so I wouldn't fucking accidentally sub tweet something Or like something Because I was so happy and when you're so happy you want to share it with people that you love And so I wanted to share it with my community because I love my community and I knew they would be happy for me Oh, yeah It's that bad, huh? I'm getting eepy 10 30 I should probably go to bed Need to make some tea Um, but should you be in spoilers domo? Honestly though, that's that's that's me. That's why I Like I already know a bit about gen 2 and it's very hard not to talk about it But um before I go to bed, did you guys have any more questions for me? I don't mind answering any questions you guys have You guys know I'm a very open book and I love to yeah And barely play games. I am a just chatting streamer. I have to fart I don't know if you heard that whisper of a fart. I really hope you didn't No spoilers for gen 2 You mean how strong he hasn't even said that gen 2 is in the works Yes, she has She definitely said the gen 2 is in the works Huh, can you pronounce? Yeah, I'm starting to can't stop talking about gen 2. She's so excited. Yeah, she's talking about fucking gen 3 It's talking about gen 3 Um I had to be like can you stop I'm like strani. You're making me feel bad. I'm like you're already conceptualizing gen 2 and 3. What about me? She's like, no, no, no, no, I don't want you to feel bad. And I'm like, no, I'm kidding. I'm excited Can I please help? And she's like, yes, I'm like, thank you slam girl. I was shot down, but it's fine Okay, wait, how do you pronounce it then? How do you pronounce it? Yeah, I think me and strani are so like it's kind of weird. She's just in a Scottish font She says she is gen 2 and gen 3 in games names for them. Yeah, exactly I'm I'm gonna try to talk her down from some of the names. That's all I'm gonna say I can't read I can't read Leave me alone. I don't speak French that well I mean squarel I can't read I can't I can't I can't Should give you some towns In my area to pronounce Talks about Jennifer with slides will be destroyed Pretty sure she has rescued herself from naming future gents. Yeah The reason it's a slime girl is because she's thinking of the name of a slimy slime hole One of them accidentally docks you wait what? Oh like that. No, um So like I'm not Afraid to say like I live in America on the east coast There's a lot of how hard to pronounce Like towns and cities Like all around along the east coast So like especially in fucking New England I Guys don't fuck with fondle of bosom. I actually really want to bring back fondle of bosom And she could be like a really touchy feely person Games is a video game. She got the concept for oh, okay In death a member of project wheeler has a name her name is fondle Of the liberty city. Yeah You look nice when you're just laying in bed instead of walking and stomping all over my booze East coast represent somebody said they knew I was east coast because I talk so bluntly And that I have an accent and I never fucking noticed that Come on beat that. Please come back You can just say come on beat it beat They're like she's I just like I've never been clocked on where I like where I'm from before And I didn't know that being blunt Was a thing like they knew where I was from and I was like Damn I did not think that I also I well, yeah, I use eastern. Yeah, that's fine. Um, and I also I talk fast Because I know people from the south talk slower. Remember when I visited my grandparents in florida um They would like people I would talk to you that were that was like can you speed the fuck up? Because you're talking Like this. Oh my god was so fucking annoying When you said you visited Montreal, that's more evident around the east coast. That's a good point East coast is kind but not nice. Oh, yeah. No east coasts. We're fucking dicks Especially massachusetts. That's why they call them mass holes I always thought that was funny. They call them that Yeah, new england people are cold, especially a lot of people are chill. Yeah. Yeah, a lot of people are chill medicaid people are fucking uppity try thing North Carolina, georgia They're kind of nice carolinas are nice Strings them and how much information is conveyed per second by different languages and accents, right? Yeah Because you can literally like especially if you're in like the uk You can clock someone's accent Because they're all accents are by region Like i'm sure you could probably look at a british Vtuber and I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of british vtubers change their accents so that they don't You don't know where they're from The latel fiends are in our own special We have to be chillin florida or else we'd melt true Got the opposite. It's not yin and yin only other field filipino side was british or something No, i'm pretty sure i have american accent yeah, i've got Like i do have like i'll have an accent sometimes that slips out And i don't know if a lot of people have like heard it slip out Like obviously i'm from america And east coast but i like sometimes when i get super excited um My or like frustrated or i just like really tired and my words slur together um, i start to have My accent comes out but uh Miss origan tipped 50 dollars You're the first vtuber i've ever watched and you quickly become probably my favorite content creator period Also could as three percent get get some donnie Such good girls, thank you Best girl And they say hello, so yeah, no i'm that type of person like i'll like i'm also really bad with eye contact um, i've always been bad with eye contact even in working in sales and Being a lot more confident than it used to be. I just don't like looking at people. I don't know what the fucking tell you i'm squirt No, i'm kidding. Um, no, where am i? And so i'll usually just like look down and smile Um, but lately i've been trying to say hello to people um Um Although like i remember going to the south and people are like too nice and i'm like stop talking to me Like why are you striking up a conversation with me? I was at a wawa I'm like and this guy like is like i'm getting coffee and i'm one of like the little station And then this guy comes and starts talking to me and i'm like, uh Why are you talking to me like you don't You don't have to talk to me right now. Like can you please go away? But like i've also adapted a skill that i've seen my dad do Um, my dad has a special skill where he can be friends with about anyone Uh, he finds common ground. He makes a joke And then miraculously he just becomes friends with this person and then He i might say becomes friends with everybody. I'm not even fucking joking He'll talk he'll like catch a snippet of a conversation that someone's having on the street Make a joke and then make the person laugh and then they're just friends He like i forget what the fuck he did. So my dad really likes to drink bourbon. Um, he likes uh, he's a collector um And like if you go to my parents house, they look they're a bunch of fucking alcoholics because they just have a shit ton of bourbon In this one side of the room, but it's it's it's not even like that My dad just likes to collect and like have it not even drink it. Um And so he goes to like this place Strikes up a conversation just being really friendly and getting to know They're like cracking jokes with the cashier and then Over the course of a couple weeks He becomes like boys with the cashier and then the cashier hooks him up with like Really like and like calls him ahead when they get in like good stuff And i'm like what the fuck and i'm like, oh wait, it just pays to be nice to people because then they're nice back So um And then like i'm like, you know, so i'm trying to be more like my dad in that way and just be nice to people Just fucking It's cat hair in my mouth um And it's it's very like i think There there's this um little girl in my building and i don't know why she likes me so much Um, i think because i look like i should be like her sister or something. She's like this really cute um Spanish girl with curly hair and She saw me in the elevator one day And she was wearing a bathing suit And i'm just sitting there and like kids are great because they just like talk to you for no reason and they just just because they just don't know like Like social cues and i'm like just i literally look like a shit. I'm like in shorts A sweatshirt a hood's up. I'm like i look like i'm fucking pathetic homeless girl my face is like Messy and this little girl looks up at me and she's like Do you like my unicorn bathing suit? And i look at her and i'm like And i And i'm like, oh my god. Yes, it's so great. She's like see mom. She likes it And then every time i see her She always makes sure she says hi to me and she's like and then um She like ran over to me one day when i was in the lobby of the apartment building and her mom's like Redacted come back and she's like i'm saying hi to my friend mom and i'm just like And so i'm like, you know what i strive to be this child That's really cute. It was really fucking cute. Um She was really sweet. She's like i like the like the natural cuteness and curiosity of kids. This is so funny to me Uh, and then like it happened again with like another kid Uh, and i'm like, do i just have that like that face where like do you kid? I'm like, i don't know if the kid's pity me or they're like, uh, you know what? I want to talk to her I like i'm i'm going to pick up my door dash. I think it was like yesterday or the day before No, it was definitely yesterday And i get into the elevator and now it's super hot outside and we have a pool in my apartment and so people um Like we're leaving to go to the pool. There's like four kids Piling the elevator with their mom and then one of the the girls just starts talking to me and i'm just like She's like, hey, it's really hot outside. Isn't it? We're going to the pool. I'm like, oh, wow. I hope you guys have a lot of fun And they're like, okay. Bye as we get to the first floor and I go to go pick up my my uh my food But it's just it was just it's this is sweet. It was just really sweet Congratulations, you're a best friend now and it's like I've always been good with kids I don't know why like I used to work at like a sermon camp. I used to be like a camp counselor and stuff and um, I remember There was this time where um These girls were like arguing because they wanted me to like I was a better artist than I am now um Because I kept up with it and they're like, can you draw our monster high dolls? So I would draw their monster high dolls and they would fight over whose doll gets to be drawn. It was so cute um I could smile with an awesomer expression in my private video the other day how they were like, oh, that's cute It was like What the fuck did I miss something? If you think you look at that, oh, no, if you guys saw me be like, who is this little stinky rat girl I looked like I was going to rob someone Wawa you narrowed that down a bit. Well, it was a wawa because there's no wawa's in our area Right from they don't we don't have wawa So It's like the little the little innocence of kids like they don't need like they're not rude There's no malice behind what they say like they're just generally Just talking to you like and it's just it's refreshing But Yeah, it's just like I want to be more like that like just be like hey And that's why like that's what I'm gonna try to do in the v2 breed thing like community and shit That's why like I'm trying to Like be like hey, I'll do this thing with you or I'll do this collab or I'll do that And it adopted me. Yeah, maybe I guess so um Oh, yeah, that's not what morgan said reminds me. Uh, I remember I went to like uh An event where I dressed up Yeah, as in like a cosplay um And this little girl asked to take a picture with me and I literally wanted to cry and like other people wanted to take pictures with me And I was just like, oh my god Like they think I'm gonna I look cool enough to ask for a picture And I was like, okay It was it was it's nice I know rena rena's looking at me like why aren't you in bed yet? She'd be piqued. Yeah, it's only downhill for me or guys She'd be cool. I try to be cool I See me I try to be cool I think I'm a cool cat cool rabbit, you know I'm cool. Yeah, I can be cool. I can be hip with the kids, you know I know about fortnight and um fortnight dances and v-wux and all that Cool rabbit sheep. Yeah, exactly Kids don't have souls. Oh, yeah, no, there's definitely some like kids that are like really fucking shitty out there Like I don't want kids, for example. I like I don't want kids One because I don't know if I didn't have kids because I don't know if I have falls less than over a century or not, but um I also just like it's a lot to raise a whole ass child. Like I don't want to Traumatize them and make them hate me I know what I put my parents through so I don't want to put my child through that with me Um, you know fucking children are expensive That means like I'm 56. Where am I gonna find a dude? Who wants to have kids with me? I'm like, I don't I just don't fucking care. I just like having cats I Was at a con for some reason. There's a couple of people that cosplay that didn't want their photo taken. Oh, yeah Sometimes you just go just to dress up and have fun. I got it. They just want to take pictures with their friends right here To be too boy, no show would be dope I find you have a sort of effless cool with how Jenny when you are you know, uh I feel like that's actually not the first time someone said that to me not to toot my own horn Um, people have always said I'm just really easy to talk to and that's why people tend to like Accidentally overshare with me Uh, uh, I'll just be like, hey, how are you feeling? They'd be like, um, you know Try to make small talk and then I'm not the type of person who I just like walk away and be like, okay Thanks for checking in. Um, I'll like like elaborate with my question. Raina. What the fuck are you doing? She's rubbing against my monitor lady. Can you? No ma'am I can't stop you I'm too tired to reach over It's your little twitchy, but what are you doing? Hi, Raina Raina's like lost weight and she looks so goofy. I mean she used to be super fucking overweight. She was like 17 Almost 20 pounds. Um But she lost a lot of weight Sadly because she went through a little depressing episode when her sister passed away, which I don't blame her and when I moved into my apartment I took her with me. Um Yeah, Raina, she's a little meow um So she's she's got a healthy weight now, but I miss her her chunky size Oh you purring big mamas Oh, yeah, she was she was a chonker because Siamese cats tend to overeat She's my life stories, ma'am Do you think your openness is a good thing or has it caused you unwanted problems? um I think some people probably wish that I was a little bit more left things to the imagination or like didn't share Like I know sometimes things I'll share something like I bet someone has like Like I said like I want a reduction and they're like, oh, why the Ruin filtered. Why did she have to say that? Oh, no, but like I'm just telling you You know just because I want to tell you And like that's fine. That's okay um It is what it is or like I might say something like oh, I'm not gonna do this content Like oh, why would you say that? Oh because I'm gonna be honest Do you want to just be strung along and let on? No, like If you want me to lead you on I'll lead you on I suppose sorry rena's are being against my microphone um I'm like this. I'm just how I am Buenos dias shippies me fun time freddy. So what did I miss? Buenos dias freddy Well, buenas noche. It's night time for me freddy It's night time for me um but I think people also Are refreshed by my openness as a vtuber because vtubers usually constantly play as something or pretend to be someone or not or And I think I I like how real I am. So I I think I'm refreshing in that You know it if you don't like it, I can't stop you from not watching I'm gonna fucking glue your eyes to the screen You want to be led in a leash not in false sense She won't make submissive crying a some more it's over I Realness of this whole company is refreshing. Yes, I agree with that because I feel like we're all very real Like we're all very open Which you don't get and I know that actually can put a lot of people off because you know First some it might ruin the fantasy And I understand that I can't disagree with you um But for some it kind of like makes it better. I don't know Most of us appreciate it. It might be small, little minority who complain. Yeah Yeah um And I do you want to say like who who complain their opinions are still valid. Um I don't want you to ever think just because like we might disagree on something that I fucking hate you. It's really hard for me to hate people uh Definitely open on the else Open this asshole. Um rena. Can I please move you? She's like just sitting on me and I'm like uncomfortable She's just you're not in a good position to sit on me lady Thank you. I appreciate it. She's moved to the bed um I miss her and I thought you said Europeans are still valid your opinions Europeans are still valid um, but They're not valid. Oh, no, okay. Um, like you're You're still allowed to dislike me I'll like the content or do how I talk or what I might do in the future or what the other girls do um, but you just don't have to make it a habit to Try to drag us, you know You can just leave Just shut your eyes and walk away from the computer, bro Or just like look up that one Tyler the creator tweet Hey, European people in chat. You're valid. I think they're all asleep right now. It's very late for them Maybe I don't know what time is it for the our European friends I'm probably gonna as mercy streaming today. I'll probably read into her If you want fantasy, you probably have to find specific vtubers that do that Some people just use models because they want to be secretive or have to set up stuff. That's true I think you know I I was totally prepared to like play a character Being in v alert an agency But I think to be honest because of my audience and because of management and astronomy I feel comfortable being myself. I think if I got into like a different company I could be like say so I could be You know play the character Um, I did definitely kind of play a character when I was ran up But I really do Feel and I'm kind of just realizing this now that I'm very much myself As she be It's very interesting Is there is life? Oh, okay Or maybe I can just like raid someone random Make, you know, I've got to make those friendships those connections raid someone from A different different company In characters with the patreon audios are for yeah, exactly Um, and then sometimes, you know, there's different roles that I play in the patreon audios but I hope you guys liked it by the way. Um, again, that was This month is the first month that I recorded back in april and I've definitely learned a lot since then so I feel I feel like because I've recorded three months of audios in advance. Uh, I recorded june july and august Uh, I I was gonna start september. I haven't done that yet. I'll probably do it soon. Um, But the september audios will probably be a lot Different than like because just because like the feedback I've gotten Um, the advice I've gotten So I feel like there'll be improvements like at least september on uh, and then You guys have also given feedback to like strani and stuff about like the scripts you want us to fill Come and that's why like strani wants like, oh, we need to make a whole month of you Just like straight dom like hardcore and I'm like facts. Please. Let's do it That's what we give the people what they want. Give them the dom that they ask for um, but yeah Okay, oh, yeah, no, it's I've paced myself for that um I also I have a lot of free time. Um, when I was out of work on leave and now since I'm just I've quit entirely um I so I just cranked them out. The other girls had a lot of other obligations They had to do so like I finished a lot of my shit in the first month Like I and then I was like, please strani throw most rough at me So should you just get thrown scripts at me? Um and shorts at me to do But yeah, don't worry about me. I don't Me and strani Like I attain to be as hard working as strani is she is the hard-working working autism I don't have autism that I fucking know of Um, but I am definitely inspired by her work ethic to work as much as I do M's and the switches are eating good on them of facts Yeah, like listening to them patriot, but I still need to listen to the second one more to finalize my feedback. Okay I feel like I don't know why I just got the equivalent of like someone sipping wine be like I need to finalize my feedback for this flavor But yeah, I hope if you're going to sleep good night, um, I'm gonna raid someone Let's see.
