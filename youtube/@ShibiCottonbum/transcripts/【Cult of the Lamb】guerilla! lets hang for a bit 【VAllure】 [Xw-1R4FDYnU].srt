00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,520
Icey's in jail because she keeps trying to turn against me, it's fine.

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:12,360
She just a little brat that needs to be corrected, don't worry about it.

Okay, okay, mods, mods, mods, mod, I love you.

4
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:25,840
You don't have to ban every time, you can ban when somebody says Shibidi toilet, that's

5
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,840
fine.

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,440
You can't do it when it's like, they're just saying Shibidi, like that's whatever.

7
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:40,480
Cause like even like, hi Pookie!

8
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,580
Pookie's a little cute goat girl, she's very sweet and Toto is a tomboy tiger girl, also

9
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:46,960
very sweet.

10
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:56,760
I love all of my friends from my past life and my current life and I will do, so you

11
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,040
will see some names you probably don't recognize that are not Corpo being modded because they're

12
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,040
my friends.

13
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,040

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:16,040
I literally gave her like the easiest fucking thing, oh no I didn't need to kill her!

17
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:29,040
My friends are my friends, I didn't fucking, I just harvester her name, no, I can't resurrect

18
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,040

19
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:36,160
I accidentally my finger slipped and I hit square instead of x, oh my fucking god, don't

20
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:43,200
tell her, don't fucking tell her I did that, don't do it.

21
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,200
Don't do it.

22
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,600
I won't forgive you if you do.

23
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,600
Let's add some grass.

24
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:57,720
Okay, everybody's going to sleep, they're going to eat, we're going to do a little funeral

25
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:04,200
tomorrow for, not Azura, cause I cut her up, but it's fine, we have the cannibal tree,

26
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:10,200
I mostly wanted to eat you guys, I didn't want to eat the other girls.

27
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,200
Hi, Tony, so who?

28
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:19,780
I like how you only particularly said hello to some people, how do you think you, you

29
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,700
made those people feel really bad?

30
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:29,200
Why don't you say everybody's name?

31
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,200
Huh?

32
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:38,600
I'm about to start, I'm about to start cracking down on everybody.

33
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:48,960
I'm like, you know, I'll be nice first week. I'll be nice. I'll be nice. No more Mrs. Nice Sheepie

34
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:05,480
Cool, then our foodie would eat one day wake up. Very good. Okay, we got that we got that

35
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,320
We got that we're good. Okay. I got some wood. You got some wood

36
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:17,360
Although it's really awkward because like my friends I'm gonna be saying like some really like out-of-pocket shit and flirting with my chat because I'm a whore

37
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,760
So I apologize in advance

38
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,080
Boop boop boop boop boop boop

39
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,920
But uh, pookie kind of already knows that

40
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,200
She's been she's been watching I

41
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,960
Don't know why I'm planting hops when I don't have the beer thing yet

42
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,680
I have to wait I have to wait for everybody to wake up

43
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:48,120
Because they want to build up my faith before I go and I also want to do a devotion thingy

44
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,480
I'm just really quiet most dreams. That's fine. Um

45
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,200
Um

46
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,640
Mod

47
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,560
Mod, what did I say? I said if somebody says she be it's okay

48
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,080
It's when they say she be toilet and our fucking zoomers in my chat

49
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,200
Then you can fucking eat them

50
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,800
I'm gonna bow bow you

51
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:30,080
It's funny I used to never have mods

52
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:39,040
Like I never had mods before um, but you guys are just get out-of-pocket and you gotta be wrangled

53
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:47,120
It's like you're scared to speak like

00:04:53,360 --> 00:05:01,080
Yes, the cult is out of starvation we are thriving we are you know having a great time like wrangling cats

55
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,520
Mmm, that's for sure something like that

00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,500
Wait decorations

66
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:07,300
No, cuz a lot of the people in the cult or actually have the materialistic trait anyways

67
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:16,500
So cuz it said they would do better like a lot of the people have like them in the trait where like they do 50% more devotion

00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:51,620
Because then I can collect silk and stuff because I think I can get like clothes for you guys

170
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,380

She got that boom boom pow these bitch been dragging my style

173
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:26,020

174
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,660
Oh wait, I didn't go this way

175
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,420
Kyle didn't step

176
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,460
That's one of my favorite vines

177
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:39,460
Stop the fuck up. Why am I missing so bad?

178
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,660
Sound like one of them said shit like oh shit

179
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,260
At least I can just roll into him

180
00:16:54,500 --> 00:17:00,660
Keep rolling rolling rolling rolling what come on my tits

181
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:12,980

182
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:24,260

183
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:34,580
I'm just walking through stuff

184
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,060
How's this work?

185
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:44,020
Hey, I'm just gonna stand right on you dammit

186
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:52,660
Hey white by the rocks of the dark sea at the foot of the strong sudden drop

187
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:59,620
Within the more pointed teeth beasts the stutter of the heart that stopped

188
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,620
In the psease

189
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:08,020
He was the fifth the fifth piss up piss piss up

190
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:15,700
I have a lisp of the old fifth our brother the one who waits back when he was known by the name Norenda

191
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,140
I don't know why that's actually difficult for me to do

192
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,340
You get the idea you got what you you can read it

193
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,860
You understand

00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:57,140
Oh, you'll be missed. You'll be not missed at all actually

200
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,860
Hmm delicious

201
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,140
Sometimes you just gotta put, you know trash in their place

202
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,220
Whoo, I just got a fucking shiver

203
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,380
Monday Monday Monday

204
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,660

00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:57,860
Let the bodies hit the floor let the bodies hit the floor. Oh, I can't growl

208
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:11,700
Beaten why for why for

209
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,380

00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,540
Take much

211
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,540

212
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:25,620
Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Now one nothing wrong with me two nothing wrong with me three

213
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,860
Nothing fuck

00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,420
Nothing wrong with me

215
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:34,820
Something's got to give please something's got to give

216
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:42,100
Let the boys. Let's hit the floor. Let the boys. Let's hit the floor. Let the boys

217
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,100
Let's do it

218
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,220
I don't know what comes after four

219
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:56,180
Wait, I was like moving in slow motion for a second. Can I do that again?

220
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,740
All right

221
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,580
Fits considering this game involves death all the time. It's precisely

222
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:15,540
I don't have to break up these skeleton homes. Oh, perfect. The bomb helps

223
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:20,340
Okay, I actually fucking hate this blunder bus. I would rather or something else

224
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,340
What is that?

225
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,660
Um

226
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:44,020
Oh, I can get clothes. That's right. Let me go here. I was gonna go get a relic, but I need clothes more

227
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,800
Hi, you're the cute little silkworm

228
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,820
Darling you look so

229
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:56,500
Drab if that's how you dress how ugly are your followers

230
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:04,740
Luckily I sell patterns for the finest fashions. It's a family business except for stupid bob

231
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:09,460
Don't mind me. Just think about how my no good brother left us all behind

232
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:13,620
Anywho, you'll need somewhere to craft these dawdling designs

233
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,340
Maybe you should look into this

234
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,900
Oh my god, thank y'all

235
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,300
I don't care

236
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,300
Oh

237
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,260
Zellie no Zellie's dissenting

238
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:35,460
Zellie stopped dissenting. It's literally her and icy

239
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,540
Oh

240
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,620
Um

241
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,620
There's a lot of hearts over here the hell

242
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,420
Oh

243
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:59,380
Well, I'd say follower waiting for indoctrination when I already I I didn't save anybody

244
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,580
Okay

245
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:10,260
Fashion is pain, you know like passion for fashion. What is this? I don't know what this is

246
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,900
Does that do something for them?

247
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:19,300
Does it do something for me when I kill them? I'm just gonna keep rolling into you motherfuckers. She better doesn't do a lot of damage

248
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,060
Nope, I don't have any

249
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,980
I don't have any I don't have any fava

250
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,020
I don't have any fava

251
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:36,980
Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Please aim down

252
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,900
Jesus krim

253
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,620
Give me a different weapon

254
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,260
Thank you

255
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,820
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool

256
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:54,340
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool. Give me that months. Give me that money

257
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:58,900
Sh money and I'm just gonna run into rocks because hopefully then they will make rocks

258
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:03,860
Make stone for me. I wish I would do that for everything like a bunch of

259
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:08,260
Wow, it's literally doesn't drop any rocks. What's up with that?

260
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,620
I

261
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:21,140
How is she bad at call of the lamb what?

262
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:30,900
Would you love your followers if they were worm it'd be easier for to step on you if you were worm

263
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:37,220
IDK what the random relic gave you but you got one. Um, I don't have a relic. I think it didn't queue properly

264
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,020
Because I never I never had a relic in the bottom corner

265
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,620
I

266
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,220
Short range weapon for a roguelike. No, I like this

267
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:55,860
Yeah, using a sword is so much better. I can't aim with the thing properly

268
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,860
Okay

269
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:19,300
Oh, she beats bad at call of the lamb. Oh, bitch and moan bitch and moan. Oh, oh my god. I'm such a little whiny fuck

270
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:26,420
Jesus you ever get tired of hearing your own voice. So I get tired of hearing your voice

271
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,260
I missed

272
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,220
Oh

273
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,060
Now my nose

274
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:56,020
How do you guys skitter around so fast come here. Thank you

275
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:04,500
Hmm, okay, I think the sleep where's the sleep

276
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,860
I don't even know what hit me. Oh problem one of them landing hit me

277
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:18,180
Oh, if you don't destroy it, it'd be they spawn more

278
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,580
That makes sense

279
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,580
That makes sense

280
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:33,140
It's supposed to show up in the corner. Oh, I can see what's cued up in the top, but it's very small

281
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,020
All right, I don't need to go that way yet

282
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,260
I

283
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,740
Like madams voice

284
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,300
They're spootish they're supposed to skitter

285
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:54,420
Wow, I missed like two rooms. Oh, no, it was just one

286
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:58,020
Stop starving

287
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:01,060
After this run, I'm gonna go back

288
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:06,260
Do I talk to the tree first? Okay, no, I just chopped down

289
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:15,060
And usually the tree also gives me something chop chop chop chop

290
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:19,700
What do they mean by chopping wood? That's crazy

291
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:24,660
Sometimes I shit out a bomb and it just actually legit

292
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:29,940
Scares me a little bit because I forgot I keep forgetting I have that ability. Where am I going?

293
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:33,060
Oh

294
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,660
I made you decide to play call the lamb because I like the game

295
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:57,940
You freeze oh what the hell I really can't tell what's happening right now. Oh babies

296
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,860
Oh

297
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,820
Oh, he hits me pretty well

298
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,540
Oh and you shoot out little

299
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:33,060
So

300
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,780
Okay, that does freeze him for a second

301
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,620
I can't really tell what's happening

302
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,500
Damn it was hoping on land before the bomb

303
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:14,660
I see mo we did it meow meow meow meow meow meow meow

304
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:23,140
Easy clap easy clap

305
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,380
Yeah

306
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,820
Take a sip of tea

307
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,900
So fuck

308
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,220
There we go, I don't know why I covered to my keyboard suddenly

309
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:56,020
Hmm

310
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:03,780
I could use some more wood I could always use a little bit more wood sugar. I don't really care about these. I have a lot of bones

311
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,700
Let's go

312
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,980
Cool beans

313
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,860
Oh

314
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:31,780
Gee that's what I sound like when I whimper this game looks like enter the gungeon

315
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,340
It's made by the same people who would have fucking thunk

316
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:40,420
Oh my followers are starving. Oh no poor babies

317
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,860
I

318
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,380
Who is this fucking dude

319
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:10,420
Who said you could eat oh it's fucking zelly

320
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,100
Oh

321
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,100
Oh, I forget when they eat

322
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:24,100
Follower meat, they'll actually stop dissenting which is kind of weird. Okay, this will be

323
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,620
Mamosa

324
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:35,140
And I kind of want her to stay a worm, but isn't she like a white fox

325
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:41,140
We'll see I can choose different roads. See you guys can have different outfits. Oh my god

326
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:46,180
Isn't that cute? Oh my god, please back. Um

327
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:51,380
Um, let's see. Let's see. I kind of really want to keep her as a worm

328
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,620
Yes, she's gonna be my little worm

329
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,260
What a variant of worm

330
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:06,740
I can give her a fat neck. No, I'm gonna give her a little swirly on her head

331
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:13,300
She's a she's celibate. Okay. She's gullible. She's terrified of death

332
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,260
Are we all deep down?

333
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,420
Um, I'm a mosa you can

334
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,540
You can

335
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,780
worship

336
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,700
This will be marrow

337
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,780
And marrow is a little is she a jellyfish

338
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:48,340
Sometimes this doesn't want to work. Um, I don't have a jellyfish

339

Bagpipe noises

Everybody's so happy everybody's so happy

917
01:32:36,180 --> 01:32:39,780
Anyway, it's time to eat. I see actually I don't want to do that

918
01:32:42,020 --> 01:32:44,020
Um, I'd rather

919
01:32:44,020 --> 01:32:46,020
I

920
01:32:53,460 --> 01:32:57,860
Like I said, I'm gonna get up and eat my soup, but I always just get distracted by

921
01:32:58,740 --> 01:33:00,740
Trying to make sure I can

922
01:33:00,900 --> 01:33:02,900
Leave in a good spot, but then I'm never satisfied

923
01:33:11,460 --> 01:33:13,460
Come here

924
01:33:14,740 --> 01:33:16,740
I

925
01:33:17,220 --> 01:33:24,820
Need to do more things to level them up. Let me uh, let me level up serenity

926
01:33:28,180 --> 01:33:30,420
Wait serenity he's fucking old now. Wait a second

927
01:33:34,260 --> 01:33:41,060
Because then every time I do a confession I can usually get somebody to be

928
01:33:44,020 --> 01:33:49,220
Oh, fuck it didn't work. Um, if I give her something for she

929
01:33:53,140 --> 01:33:56,180
I don't want to intimidate her. I just want to ask her I can't give her a gift

930
01:33:58,340 --> 01:34:00,340
I can just kill her

931
01:34:04,100 --> 01:34:08,340
I should have okay, I shouldn't have picked her I think somebody else

932
01:34:08,420 --> 01:34:17,060

937
01:34:50,900 --> 01:34:52,900

01:35:21,940 --> 01:35:23,940
Scotland forever

941
01:35:29,540 --> 01:35:31,540

01:35:35,780 --> 01:35:37,780

01:35:47,380 --> 01:35:54,340
Thank god for that. Thank god for so I could collect tides from everybody like I go around and shake people down for their money, but

01:36:04,340 --> 01:36:06,340

But two breadsticks

981
01:40:09,220 --> 01:40:11,220

01:41:35,140 --> 01:41:37,140
Everybody

01:41:37,140 --> 01:41:39,140
Okay

989
01:41:57,140 --> 01:41:59,140
See what's going on

990
01:41:59,300 --> 01:42:03,780
How do you pop her collarbone? Uh, I like twist a certain way and it just like makes a popping noise. I don't know

991
01:42:03,780 --> 01:42:05,620

You're going great after watching the collab. Are you asking us or the cats? I'm asking you guys

993
01:42:11,780 --> 01:42:14,900
Raina's by my feet in her bed when we swapping around

994
01:42:18,660 --> 01:42:21,220
Where's the little girl she she hanging out

995
01:42:35,620 --> 01:42:42,180
Weirdest places like I have all these cat beds as she sleeps on the back of the rug behind the door in my bathroom

996
01:42:42,180 --> 01:42:44,180
I don't

997
01:42:54,180 --> 01:42:56,180
Why

998
01:43:06,580 --> 01:43:08,580
Oh

999
01:43:19,860 --> 01:43:21,860
I don't mind the way the dip in sauce

1000
01:43:35,620 --> 01:43:37,620
I

1001
01:43:44,660 --> 01:43:46,660
Little bit of dinner

1002
01:43:57,940 --> 01:43:59,940
Ow, boomi

1003
01:43:59,940 --> 01:44:05,220
Sometimes he puts his paws up on my legs but has his claws out stretches in their parts

1004
01:44:30,260 --> 01:44:32,260
I

1005
01:44:35,300 --> 01:44:40,500
Love love love love does your bra foot well it might be it not on my bra spit well

1006
01:44:40,500 --> 01:44:47,460
It's hard for me to find bras

1007
01:44:57,380 --> 01:45:01,700
They usually don't carry my size in those places because when I take service on the home gun

1008
01:45:04,820 --> 01:45:06,820
Usually after that that's why I like the

1009
01:45:06,900 --> 01:45:08,660
um

1010
01:45:08,660 --> 01:45:11,460
Rihanna place because they have like like that long drink

1011
01:45:12,180 --> 01:45:14,180
It looks like that is

1012
01:45:15,460 --> 01:45:17,860
Not all places carry e-cups

1013
01:45:21,780 --> 01:45:23,780
And it honestly it varies from like

1014
01:45:25,700 --> 01:45:27,380
Um

1015
01:45:27,380 --> 01:45:30,500
brand to brand because like I'll wear like an airy bra

1016
01:45:31,620 --> 01:45:32,580
And

1017
01:45:32,580 --> 01:45:36,660
Their biggest will like sort of fit me and I'll wear a victoria's eager bra other bras

1018
01:45:36,980 --> 01:45:41,220
Don't fit me and then I'll wear savages 20 bra and those bras are fine

1019
01:45:45,460 --> 01:45:47,460
Yeah, that's such a pain

1020
01:45:50,180 --> 01:45:53,460
I got my soup it tastes delicious. I got my breadsticks

1021
01:46:02,260 --> 01:46:04,260
Looks like I'm ready to get boys

1022
01:46:06,900 --> 01:46:08,900
I

1023
01:46:17,060 --> 01:46:19,060
I thought you can see me fucking chewing

1024
01:46:28,980 --> 01:46:33,060
Do the background music for that this one tastes delicious

1025
01:46:37,380 --> 01:46:40,020
I didn't go all your booty. It's so funny how like

1026
01:46:42,340 --> 01:46:45,380
What people like how people's opinions change on body types

1027
01:46:46,180 --> 01:46:48,020
Because I remember like early 2000s

1028
01:46:48,100 --> 01:46:50,340
It was like awesome if you were like anorexically thin

1029
01:46:51,060 --> 01:46:57,620
And now it's like and then after that a little bit later 2000s like you need huge titties and now it's like you need a huge ass

1030
01:46:57,780 --> 01:46:59,780
It's like so funny to me

1031
01:47:07,380 --> 01:47:09,380
Or fish it in Japanese

1032
01:47:16,100 --> 01:47:18,100
Damn have to leave for work right as yeah

1033
01:47:24,420 --> 01:47:26,420
Sorry you might miss out on the appage

1034
01:47:28,900 --> 01:47:30,900
99 are you happy?

1035
01:47:36,900 --> 01:47:43,220
I want to accidentally put something on my keyboard so I can move this on the way

1036
01:47:49,380 --> 01:47:53,620
I don't even know what to yap about I don't have any idea what to yap about right now

1037
01:47:58,180 --> 01:48:00,180
I think all my energy

1038
01:48:01,380 --> 01:48:05,620
Was stolen from the collab and just laughing so hard

1039
01:48:06,660 --> 01:48:08,660
I

1040
01:48:15,380 --> 01:48:17,380
She be out of yab

1041
01:48:18,420 --> 01:48:20,420
It happens

1042
01:48:25,780 --> 01:48:31,940
Madam do you happen to work in tech my phone's flashing a green tint? I don't know what that means

1043
01:48:37,220 --> 01:48:42,500
Oh like your phone screen. Do you have a android or an apple device?

1044
01:48:48,980 --> 01:48:51,540
The club was oh the club was hilarious. Please watch the vod

1045
01:48:53,860 --> 01:48:55,860
Is an apple did you drop it?

1046
01:48:59,540 --> 01:49:01,940
If it's flashing a green tint you probably have to take it to the junior bar

1047
01:49:07,540 --> 01:49:11,300
Because it sounds like you might have loosened a cable

1048
01:49:13,220 --> 01:49:15,220
I hope you have apple care bro

1049
01:49:15,700 --> 01:49:18,820
It's apple care, you know screen replacement is

1050
01:49:20,260 --> 01:49:25,700
29 bucks, but um, I think depending on the model it's way more than that

1051
01:49:33,220 --> 01:49:35,700
I apple care on my phone because I drop that shit all the time

1052
01:49:36,740 --> 01:49:38,740
I

1053
01:49:40,180 --> 01:49:42,180
For the low price of your soul

1054
01:49:50,180 --> 01:49:54,500
I know Mike's you tweaking well, yeah, because we were tweaking so we were gonna peak like hell

1055
01:49:59,220 --> 01:50:02,260
Club was fire if you haven't seen it watch it now if you have watch it again

1056
01:50:02,900 --> 01:50:09,460
Yeah, we couldn't and we didn't end up doing a power wash simulator because nothing was working

1057
01:50:12,660 --> 01:50:15,860
So I was like, all right, we're gonna play this. Oh, we don't have that game. Okay, we're gonna play this

1058
01:50:15,940 --> 01:50:17,300
Okay, we don't have that game

1059
01:50:17,300 --> 01:50:21,220
All right, play this. Okay. We don't know if that would work properly because we don't have time to set it all up and make

1060
01:50:21,220 --> 01:50:23,940
Sure, it's fine. Although then we did guard dick phone. It was worked out worked out

1061
01:50:24,100 --> 01:50:30,020
The boys is back. Are you serious? What?

1062
01:50:31,940 --> 01:50:36,580
I fucking love that show the boys came back. Okay. I have to watch that then probably watch that tonight

1063
01:50:42,740 --> 01:50:44,740
It's the last season

1064
01:50:46,020 --> 01:50:50,340
I thought they were doing five seasons. I know they already got renewed for a fifth season even after this fourth one was released

1065
01:50:54,900 --> 01:51:02,020
I'm so excited. I I'm so fucking it's that's funny. So I have a guilty pleasure of watching like really cheesy romance shows like

1066
01:51:02,580 --> 01:51:06,420
Um, so I've been watching like exo kitty on netflix was about like this

1067
01:51:07,220 --> 01:51:09,220
half korean half white girl who goes to

1068
01:51:10,020 --> 01:51:12,020
Korea to be closer with her mom

1069
01:51:12,420 --> 01:51:14,500
And also see like her long-distance boyfriend or whatever

1070
01:51:14,500 --> 01:51:18,340
But then he figures she figures out that he's like cheating or whatever the fuck it's a long story

1071
01:51:19,060 --> 01:51:23,620
Um, but they use the same exact school as in gen v

1072
01:51:23,940 --> 01:51:29,060
And so they break into like the principal's office in one scene and i'm like wait a fucking second

1073
01:51:29,060 --> 01:51:33,060
This is the same principal office from gen v. I was like, huh?

1074
01:51:34,180 --> 01:51:40,500
Um, I was just really i'm really amused by that because the juxtaposition of those two shows is quite amusing. Um

1075
01:51:41,940 --> 01:51:47,620
And but i'm really bummed that actor died because I i really like that actor. He was really good at sabrina

1076
01:51:48,260 --> 01:51:52,740
Um, he was really good in gen v. I really want to see his character develop more and it really just sucks

1077
01:51:52,820 --> 01:51:58,100
He died in a um the actor that played the guy with magnetic powers

1078
01:51:59,060 --> 01:52:02,900
Uh, I can't remember off the top of my head. Uh, he died in a motorcycle accident

1079
01:52:08,420 --> 01:52:10,420
It's really sad

1080
01:52:11,780 --> 01:52:14,740
Reminds me of the guy from star trek who

1081
01:52:16,420 --> 01:52:21,220
Um, he was like had that thick accent, but he was also in a couple other things

1082
01:52:22,180 --> 01:52:24,180
Um, and he got

1083
01:52:24,500 --> 01:52:27,780
Crushed by his own vehicle. It like squeezed him between a gate

1084
01:52:28,580 --> 01:52:30,980
And he was squeezed between a gate in his car and died like that's

1085
01:52:32,740 --> 01:52:37,300
It's so sad like oh, what a way to go. So there's great talent gone

1086
01:52:38,020 --> 01:52:40,020
Especially they were both young

1087
01:52:44,580 --> 01:52:47,460
Yeah, like um like my uncle has a motorcycle

1088
01:52:47,540 --> 01:52:56,020
And I have like my cousin uh, he's he's really into dirt bikes and I always like worry for them, but it's like

1089
01:52:58,100 --> 01:53:01,860
It is what like it is a dangerous hobby as long as you can take all the right precautions

1090
01:53:02,580 --> 01:53:07,780
And it can still be not your fault or something can still happen and you know, that's the same with a car, you know

1091
01:53:13,060 --> 01:53:15,060
Yeah

1092
01:53:18,420 --> 01:53:21,460
Oh my god, the soup is so good. It's a little bit too salty though

1093
01:53:26,580 --> 01:53:29,860
But I'm so I have to watch that then I like

1094
01:53:32,020 --> 01:53:36,180
I like what was it did somebody make like a reference to like

1095
01:53:38,100 --> 01:53:41,700
Oh, that's right in that video that someone made a memes of our um

1096
01:53:42,660 --> 01:53:49,860
Of our debuts and 2.0's they like used a couple the boys memes with like, uh the deep

1097
01:53:51,700 --> 01:53:57,700
And like strutty and like um octopuses octopi whatever and stuff and I was like I was like wait

1098
01:53:57,700 --> 01:53:59,700
Why was I thinking of the deep the other day?

1099
01:54:01,300 --> 01:54:03,300
Every time I think about

1100
01:54:03,860 --> 01:54:10,180
That actor I just laugh because he plays the deep and then he also plays the main love interest in gossip girl and I just

1101
01:54:11,860 --> 01:54:14,820
Sends me every time I'm tense. I'm gone

1102
01:54:21,860 --> 01:54:25,300
Anton Yelkin. Yes. Yes, uh russian peas. He was young too

1103
01:54:25,860 --> 01:54:30,500
He was really good in star trek and he was also in like, um odd thomas. That was the movie

1104
01:54:33,940 --> 01:54:39,700
You want me to have you want me to have a alt alt account? Uh reaction to the boys

1105
01:54:42,260 --> 01:54:46,340
The deep and strong use a scary ass combination you're right

1106
01:54:51,860 --> 01:54:53,860
Sup sup sup

1107
01:54:57,060 --> 01:55:00,500
But I just look it was like making jokes about like the octopus and the deep

1108
01:55:04,740 --> 01:55:07,700
Strani is the octopus and the reeflings are the deep

1109
01:55:12,580 --> 01:55:18,340
And his original girlfriend the deeps girlfriend is um reeflings

1110
01:55:19,940 --> 01:55:24,020
Current girlfriends and they're leaving her for the octopus

1111
01:55:36,340 --> 01:55:38,340
Take a sip be

1112
01:55:38,900 --> 01:55:41,400
Homelanders and mk. What does that mean?

1113
01:55:45,540 --> 01:55:47,540
A mortal combat

1114
01:55:48,580 --> 01:55:54,900
No fucking way. That's actually a perfect character for more mortal combat. That's hilarious

1115
01:55:58,180 --> 01:56:00,180
Sorry took me a moment

1116
01:56:05,460 --> 01:56:07,460
Mario Kart

1117
01:56:08,500 --> 01:56:10,500
Oh

1118
01:56:12,100 --> 01:56:18,260
Omni-man peace maker. Oh my god, I would love to see a homelander versus um omni-man

1119
01:56:24,740 --> 01:56:26,740
That's so awesome

1120
01:56:31,860 --> 01:56:33,860
I personally suck at fighting games

1121
01:56:39,300 --> 01:56:45,540
I just to be honest I could totally see a crossover of the boys and invincible

1122
01:56:49,860 --> 01:56:53,700
Not like a cartoon one but like a um like a live action one

1123
01:57:03,620 --> 01:57:08,020
I was called him glenn. Um, I don't think they would be able to have the same guy as the actor for

1124
01:57:09,140 --> 01:57:13,460
The main character. I can't remember anybody's names from invincible. What?

1125
01:57:16,500 --> 01:57:21,060
Iron man invincible. Yeah, I know that. Yeah. Mm-hmm. I didn't know about that

1126
01:57:23,140 --> 01:57:25,140
The boys getting washed facts

1127
01:57:28,740 --> 01:57:34,340
Yeah, uh, I don't um omni-man would destroy homelander. I will say it

1128
01:57:34,340 --> 01:57:36,340
I

1129
01:57:37,780 --> 01:57:39,300
Also

1130
01:57:39,300 --> 01:57:41,700
The last season of invincible. I'm sorry, but like

1131
01:57:42,420 --> 01:57:44,580
It was such a fucking letdown for me

1132
01:57:45,220 --> 01:57:51,300
I'm like it was just all over the place like the main villain disappears after an episode and then comes back at the very last

1133
01:57:53,140 --> 01:57:56,420
Episode and like does fuck all and I'm like, okay

1134
01:57:58,900 --> 01:58:00,900
Excuse me

1135
01:58:01,380 --> 01:58:03,380
Yeah, I was I was really disappointed

1136
01:58:04,980 --> 01:58:11,140
It's funny how you can technically put all I guess anyone he gets wiped true

1137
01:58:12,260 --> 01:58:14,740
He's just he's just psychologically like

1138
01:58:15,860 --> 01:58:17,300
one of

1139
01:58:17,300 --> 01:58:20,980
Homelander's traits is he just really knows how to manipulate people really well

1140
01:58:21,700 --> 01:58:23,540
um

1141
01:58:23,540 --> 01:58:25,540
Because he's a fucking psychopath

1142
01:58:26,260 --> 01:58:27,940
And so he knows like

1143
01:58:27,940 --> 01:58:32,180
It's it's funny because he's not a sociopath because he has empathy

1144
01:58:32,660 --> 01:58:33,780
um

1145
01:58:33,860 --> 01:58:39,940
And he but he uses his knowledge of empathy and how people react to things against them. It's very smart

1146
01:58:40,900 --> 01:58:43,860
Totally unhinged. I actually really like he's one of my

1147
01:58:44,740 --> 01:58:46,180
favorite

1148
01:58:46,180 --> 01:58:49,220
Villain characters because he's just so well developed

1149
01:58:50,100 --> 01:58:51,700
um

1150
01:58:51,700 --> 01:58:56,580
I think that's why I really liked like I just like you know, you think there's a character you just love to hate

1151
01:58:57,220 --> 01:59:02,740
And like that is homelander like he's such a like like ah, fuck. I hate him, but he's awesome

1152
01:59:02,740 --> 01:59:05,300
But fuck him like that's yeah, that's homelander

1153
01:59:10,500 --> 01:59:14,900
Yeah, the minute you crack his ego he's done for yeah, like he has like he's a super powerful

1154
01:59:15,540 --> 01:59:17,540
Whatever the fuck likes what do they call them?

1155
01:59:18,580 --> 01:59:20,580
What do they call people with powers I forget

1156
01:59:22,980 --> 01:59:24,740
V hero

1157
01:59:24,820 --> 01:59:29,860
Vagina hero virginity hero a soup. Yeah, he's really soupy

1158
01:59:30,500 --> 01:59:32,500
um

1159
01:59:33,140 --> 01:59:37,940
But I would even it's funny because not even a superhero. He's just he just has superhuman abilities

1160
01:59:39,700 --> 01:59:45,300
Hope they handle them well on the news. I bet they will super powerful man, baby. Yeah, because he's like under like mentally

1161
01:59:45,300 --> 01:59:48,260
He's just like has not had proper human interaction

1162
01:59:49,060 --> 01:59:51,860
Gaslight maxi. Yeah, I also really like um

1163
01:59:52,260 --> 01:59:54,260
Butcher because

1164
01:59:55,060 --> 02:00:01,780
He's such a like a good anti-hero like I would love to see like uh team up of butcher and the punisher

1165
02:00:01,940 --> 02:00:03,940
Like that would be a cool crossover

1166
02:00:04,980 --> 02:00:06,980
Homelander is an incel with a cape

1167
02:00:08,260 --> 02:00:10,260
But it's funny because he's like

1168
02:00:13,380 --> 02:00:17,140
At first I'm like, oh, he's like a what like, you know when he's with that

1169
02:00:17,860 --> 02:00:19,860
One chick who's a nazi which that made me

1170
02:00:20,500 --> 02:00:22,500
crack the fuck up

1171
02:00:23,860 --> 02:00:27,940
Like his relationship with her and how he just like would complain about stuff all the time

1172
02:00:27,940 --> 02:00:30,980
Like she's in that bed and she's just getting me in my handy and she's like half dead

1173
02:00:32,500 --> 02:00:35,940
Um, basically the dude from mega mine. Yeah, you know

1174
02:00:38,260 --> 02:00:39,620
But like

1175
02:00:39,620 --> 02:00:41,620
he's not

1176
02:00:41,860 --> 02:00:47,140
Like he was it's weird because he like respects people at the same time. He's like, no, no, no

1177
02:00:47,140 --> 02:00:51,860
We don't we don't we don't treat people like that, but then he'll just like kill people again

1178
02:00:52,100 --> 02:00:57,140
Like that. It's just so such a funny thing to me. He's like, no, that's where I draw the line

1179
02:00:57,780 --> 02:00:59,220
racism

1180
02:00:59,220 --> 02:01:01,220
No

1181
02:01:01,220 --> 02:01:03,220
I won't allow it

1182
02:01:05,300 --> 02:01:10,180
Uh, see when he works. Yeah, yeah, that was that was an intense scene

1183
02:01:10,980 --> 02:01:12,980
Like when he kind of just like switches it on

1184
02:01:13,940 --> 02:01:15,940
and just like fucking

1185
02:01:15,940 --> 02:01:17,940
He does have a way with words

1186
02:01:17,940 --> 02:01:19,940
A milk scene is a very iconic

1187
02:01:20,180 --> 02:01:23,060
all the best like terrible characters

1188
02:01:24,020 --> 02:01:26,020
Drink milk in such a weird way

1189
02:01:26,500 --> 02:01:30,980
It like I remember reading an article of like, you know, you got like jack knuckleson's character

1190
02:01:31,140 --> 02:01:37,620
I think from one flew over the cuckoo's nest then you have like, uh, the main character from like a clockwork orange

1191
02:01:38,020 --> 02:01:40,900
And then you have homelander in like what milk

1192
02:01:41,540 --> 02:01:45,620
Represents because it's usually something that children consume

1193
02:01:46,660 --> 02:01:52,180
And it's like these adult men consuming it and like twisting innocence. It was such a great article

1194
02:01:52,180 --> 02:01:55,060
I wish I could recall more of it. It was such an interesting

1195
02:01:56,180 --> 02:01:57,380
uh

1196
02:01:57,380 --> 02:01:59,140
deep dive into

1197
02:01:59,140 --> 02:02:05,860
What fucking milk symbolism was just like corruption like, uh, how they can do this corrupt others

1198
02:02:05,940 --> 02:02:08,580
But they're also extremely childlike at the same time

1199
02:02:09,140 --> 02:02:13,140
Homelander is definitely deserve a fan. He's a bleeding heart

1200
02:02:14,500 --> 02:02:17,300
That would be so funny if they had like a scene of him just like

1201
02:02:17,540 --> 02:02:20,980
Fapping to a vtuber or like he falls in love with like some online girl

1202
02:02:21,940 --> 02:02:25,780
Then he hunts her down and like freaks like like I feel like he would be a good yonder, eh?

1203
02:02:26,980 --> 02:02:28,980
His interaction to the storefront was like, yeah 100%

1204
02:02:31,380 --> 02:02:33,380
Um

1205
02:02:33,380 --> 02:02:35,380
Little man, no

1206
02:02:38,980 --> 02:02:40,980
But uh, yeah, I always love

1207
02:02:41,300 --> 02:02:42,820
character development

1208
02:02:42,820 --> 02:02:48,340
And uh tv shows that there's no character development or like the characters are just so infuriate

1209
02:02:48,900 --> 02:02:53,380
Furiatingly superficial or one-sided. I'm just like I can't consume this

1210
02:02:54,500 --> 02:02:56,180
Poor boy. Yeah

1211
02:02:56,180 --> 02:03:01,300
Yeah, that was I actually really liked uh black noir's character. Um

1212
02:03:02,100 --> 02:03:04,100
It's weird though because

1213
02:03:04,100 --> 02:03:06,100
It's very different from the comics

1214
02:03:06,420 --> 02:03:08,420
And I

1215
02:03:08,740 --> 02:03:13,060
I kind of wish they stuck to the comics because I think that would have been

1216
02:03:14,340 --> 02:03:15,860
very

1217
02:03:15,860 --> 02:03:17,860
Interesting to go

1218
02:03:18,900 --> 02:03:22,420
Down like that route. Yeah the original uh boys comics

1219
02:03:22,580 --> 02:03:25,700
It isn't as good like the people have said like this tv show

1220
02:03:25,700 --> 02:03:30,900
I've only read like a couple like a little like bits of uh the comics here and there. Um, but

1221
02:03:31,780 --> 02:03:35,060
Apparently like the show is actually better than the source material

1222
02:03:37,060 --> 02:03:39,060
Um

1223
02:03:39,220 --> 02:03:41,220
There's your comments about yeah

1224
02:03:42,820 --> 02:03:44,020
The

1225
02:03:44,020 --> 02:03:48,180
Creator from letter didn't say he's meant to be satirical. Oh, yeah, that's that's totally

1226
02:03:49,460 --> 02:03:56,100
So prevalent just satire of the american dream. There's a twisted version of the american dream. He is manifest destiny, you know

1227
02:03:56,900 --> 02:03:58,900
um, but

1228
02:04:00,020 --> 02:04:03,860
Yeah, it was I would have I would have liked to see how that would have gone down

1229
02:04:04,420 --> 02:04:06,420
I feel like it would have

1230
02:04:06,420 --> 02:04:07,540
Been interesting

1231
02:04:07,540 --> 02:04:12,260
But um, I feel like they'll approach that in another way like because I feel like they're

1232
02:04:13,140 --> 02:04:16,340
Already kind of approaching that with the sun and everything like what

1233
02:04:17,060 --> 02:04:18,500
would have happened

1234
02:04:18,500 --> 02:04:24,020
The comics just an edge of abortion on the justice league. Hey, man. That's what my fan fiction was when I wrote

1235
02:04:24,500 --> 02:04:26,500
When I wrote a fan fiction I was younger

1236
02:04:26,980 --> 02:04:30,820
I think this hates superheroes as parodies of them are very surface level. Yeah

1237
02:04:31,220 --> 02:04:37,540
Hero guys episode was tame compared to the comic. Oh, I did not it was funny. So like

1238
02:04:38,420 --> 02:04:41,060
My dad's recommended the boys to me. Um

1239
02:04:42,180 --> 02:04:43,940
and

1240
02:04:43,940 --> 02:04:48,420
I remember I was watching that season that here guys. I was in he's like, did you get to the episode?

1241
02:04:48,500 --> 02:04:51,300
I'm like, what he's like, did you get to the hero guys an episode?

1242
02:04:52,180 --> 02:04:54,180
And I'm like, no and he's like

1243
02:04:55,860 --> 02:04:57,860
Just walked away

1244
02:04:57,940 --> 02:04:59,060
Like

1245
02:04:59,060 --> 02:05:04,020
Okay, and then I like and then I like watching I'm like dad

1246
02:05:05,300 --> 02:05:09,060
Why did you recommend me the show because I think I started watching it when like the second season came out

1247
02:05:09,060 --> 02:05:12,020
Or whatever. It wasn't the third season that one was in. I don't remember. Um

1248
02:05:13,860 --> 02:05:15,860
And yeah, sometimes

1249
02:05:16,420 --> 02:05:20,740
Sometimes my dad recommends me shows and I'm like, why the fuck did you recommend this to me?

1250
02:05:22,980 --> 02:05:24,980
He's like, yeah, you'd like this

1251
02:05:25,540 --> 02:05:27,540
But he's right. I like it

1252
02:05:28,500 --> 02:05:30,500
It was it's a great show

1253
02:05:30,980 --> 02:05:36,980
I recommended the boys to my boss. I'm not sure who watched it was wife. Yeah, my mom could not watch that. My mom has very uh

1254
02:05:38,100 --> 02:05:40,100
My mom is weird because she hates

1255
02:05:40,580 --> 02:05:47,620
Violence, but she really likes military related tv shows because I think she was watching like seal team or whatever the fuck it's called

1256
02:05:48,420 --> 02:05:52,260
And I'm like, okay mom, you can't watch the boys, but you'll watch like war

1257
02:05:53,220 --> 02:05:58,820
Like this is just like out like silly goofy like, you know, it's fake

1258
02:05:59,300 --> 02:06:01,700
But like that's like based in reality

1259
02:06:02,340 --> 02:06:03,540
and like

1260
02:06:03,540 --> 02:06:05,540
war

1261
02:06:07,460 --> 02:06:09,460
And like like for example

1262
02:06:09,940 --> 02:06:11,940
My mom really likes outlander

1263
02:06:12,500 --> 02:06:15,380
Outlander is a great book really great premise if you don't know what it's about

1264
02:06:15,460 --> 02:06:20,260
It's about this woman who has this ability to go through these special stones back into

1265
02:06:20,660 --> 02:06:25,060
Ireland I think in like the 1400s and she falls in love with a guy there. Um

1266
02:06:25,700 --> 02:06:30,100
Again the 1400s was a wild place in scotland. There was a lot of

1267
02:06:31,220 --> 02:06:33,780
raping and pillaging and murdering and terrible stuff

1268
02:06:34,100 --> 02:06:37,460
And I'm watching the most fucked up scene from this tv show

1269
02:06:38,020 --> 02:06:44,340
So my mom's like, oh you'd like it. It has like fantasy and like historical stuff that you like. I'm like, okay

1270
02:06:45,060 --> 02:06:47,780
And I'm like, oh this dude is totally just

1271
02:06:48,340 --> 02:06:52,580
On going ham on this poor woman and okay

1272
02:06:53,700 --> 02:06:55,140
I'm like mom

1273
02:06:55,140 --> 02:06:57,140
Yeah, my mom likes like medieval shows

1274
02:06:57,780 --> 02:06:59,780
Um, but she couldn't watch game of thrones

1275
02:07:00,500 --> 02:07:04,420
Actually, no, did she finish I asked my mom. Did she finish game of thrones? I don't know

1276
02:07:05,380 --> 02:07:07,380
maybe

1277
02:07:07,620 --> 02:07:10,980
And it's weird for her she like has to watch something that's like realistic

1278
02:07:12,500 --> 02:07:16,580
Like it has to have some realism to it or she just can't get into it and like a lot of people are like that

1279
02:07:16,900 --> 02:07:23,540
So she likes historical fiction because it's like rooted like you can twist the truth just a little bit like it leaves enough for like, um

1280
02:07:24,340 --> 02:07:26,340
what's the expression

1281
02:07:26,660 --> 02:07:28,260
Suspensive

1282
02:07:28,260 --> 02:07:31,140
disbelief whereas fantasy you kind of throw that out the window

1283
02:07:31,540 --> 02:07:36,980
But like for me, I can understand like and most people can watch it and be like this is fantasy supposed to be like this

1284
02:07:36,980 --> 02:07:40,660
I don't have to believe in it. Um, she like Rambo probably. I don't know

1285
02:07:40,660 --> 02:07:42,660
I

1286
02:07:42,900 --> 02:07:44,900
Wasn't she married though? I think so

1287
02:07:47,620 --> 02:07:49,620
Thanks mom

1288
02:07:49,620 --> 02:07:50,740
um

1289
02:07:50,740 --> 02:07:53,140
Yeah, what I've just been watching a lot of dumb stuff lately

1290
02:07:53,780 --> 02:07:57,300
I've been in my my lonely woman era. Um

1291
02:07:58,100 --> 02:08:03,780
Sometimes I just like get into this funk when it becomes like spring summer where I'm like, oh, I'm a lonely person

1292
02:08:04,340 --> 02:08:08,660
And so I just watched like I or I binge watched this whole like chinese drama one time

1293
02:08:08,740 --> 02:08:10,740
And it was really good and I was like sad

1294
02:08:11,380 --> 02:08:15,140
And then I just watched binge watched euphoria and that was fucking depressing as hell

1295
02:08:16,900 --> 02:08:20,500
I literally cried at the and I don't cry at shows a show depressed me to fuck

1296
02:08:20,820 --> 02:08:24,420
And I'm like, I need to I need a palette cleanser. So then I watched bridgerton

1297
02:08:25,220 --> 02:08:27,220
It's fucking great. I love bridgerton

1298
02:08:27,380 --> 02:08:29,700
I love bridgerton so much. I can't wait for it to come back

1299
02:08:30,260 --> 02:08:31,940
in a couple days

1300
02:08:31,940 --> 02:08:37,140
I hate that shows split it up split stuff up into two fucking parts now. That is the stupidest shit ever

1301
02:08:37,780 --> 02:08:39,460
um

1302
02:08:39,460 --> 02:08:42,740
Yeah, I was watching that I literally binge watched that stupid tv show

1303
02:08:43,780 --> 02:08:47,940
It's watching watch the kissing booth on netflix the third one

1304
02:08:50,740 --> 02:08:52,740
Wasn't as good as the first though

1305
02:08:54,340 --> 02:08:59,380
Euphoria no euphoria with the people but the kid the angsty kids in high school

1306
02:08:59,860 --> 02:09:02,580
You guys have said the said this to me before

1307
02:09:03,300 --> 02:09:05,300
Not that euphoria

1308
02:09:06,260 --> 02:09:08,260
Not the visual novel

1309
02:09:11,700 --> 02:09:16,660
Yeah, exactly exactly exactly she'll watch that but she won't watch superheroes

1310
02:09:17,300 --> 02:09:20,260
Like she'll like watch like a marvel movie, but she like can't get it

1311
02:09:20,260 --> 02:09:23,220
So like me and my dad were like, oh, we're gonna go see furiosa

1312
02:09:23,780 --> 02:09:29,060
Um, I just in some of you know why I was watching mad max again. Um, my mom's like, yeah, that's for you guys

1313
02:09:30,180 --> 02:09:32,180
Okay

1314
02:09:33,140 --> 02:09:35,140
The one with spider man's girlfriend

1315
02:09:37,060 --> 02:09:44,020
Huh, I don't love I don't even I don't even read the visual novel. I don't know like I just know it's bad

1316
02:09:45,780 --> 02:09:47,780
I haven't read that

1317
02:09:48,740 --> 02:09:50,900
I've only ever read metamorphosis and that was

1318
02:09:54,100 --> 02:10:01,540
You're one of the 50 people who saw furiosa. I haven't seen it yet. I might just I don't think I'm gonna end up seeing it

1319
02:10:01,780 --> 02:10:04,340
Um in theaters because I wanted to see you in theaters

1320
02:10:05,220 --> 02:10:09,700
But it feels like it sucks because it's got really good ratings. It just got like shat on in the box office

1321
02:10:11,380 --> 02:10:13,380
But I heard it was good

1322
02:10:13,700 --> 02:10:15,700
I like the actress. Hello

1323
02:10:15,780 --> 02:10:17,460
Where does he happen?

1324
02:10:17,460 --> 02:10:19,460
We're just hanging out

1325
02:10:19,940 --> 02:10:21,940
I like, you know metamorphosizing

1326
02:10:23,940 --> 02:10:30,020
When I went to see furiosa, I was the only one there. I think it's because nobody fucking knew what it was about like mad max was

1327
02:10:30,020 --> 02:10:32,020
very hyped

1328
02:10:32,900 --> 02:10:34,900
Because people remember the old mad max

1329
02:10:35,060 --> 02:10:37,620
And then people now are just like, okay, but what's that about?

1330
02:10:38,340 --> 02:10:40,340
Yeah, it's got ania taylor joy or whatever her name is

1331
02:10:40,900 --> 02:10:42,420
but like

1332
02:10:42,420 --> 02:10:44,420
Charlie's there in as hot as fuck

1333
02:10:46,500 --> 02:10:48,500
But um

1334
02:10:48,820 --> 02:10:50,820
Oh, excuse me

1335
02:10:51,060 --> 02:10:56,660
Just fear your own flop. I don't I don't recall. It was okay. Like when I watched it again, I'm like, yeah, this is kind of what I remember

1336
02:10:57,620 --> 02:11:02,020
It was so weird because like listening to um

1337
02:11:04,100 --> 02:11:06,100
The actor for

1338
02:11:07,460 --> 02:11:08,580
max

1339
02:11:08,580 --> 02:11:13,940
talk, I realized that the the movie was like weirdly dubbed every time he spoke

1340
02:11:15,220 --> 02:11:18,900
Like I know he didn't speak often, but I was like, uh

1341
02:11:19,780 --> 02:11:24,740
It feels like somebody else's voice. Like I know he has an um, he usually has an english accent

1342
02:11:25,620 --> 02:11:27,620
Australian or something. I was like, huh?

1343
02:11:29,700 --> 02:11:33,140
I'm thinking about watching the uh original mad max stuff

1344
02:11:35,540 --> 02:11:41,700
Metamorphosis showed editing is only relenting watch barbie purely for Ryan gossip. Listen, I liked barbie

1345
02:11:43,060 --> 02:11:47,460
Maybe it's because I'm a woman. Maybe not. I enjoyed it a lot. I saw with my parents

1346
02:11:49,300 --> 02:11:51,300
My mom didn't like it

1347
02:11:52,260 --> 02:11:59,620
I think she was like it so it was okay. I really liked it. I like cried. I cried at that movie. I felt like it hit me

1348
02:12:01,700 --> 02:12:06,820
My dad was like it was cute. I think my dad liked him more than my mom then again, my dad's a Taylor Swift fan, so

1349
02:12:09,860 --> 02:12:12,980
Which way was turned black man Taylor Swift from the boys

1350
02:12:15,780 --> 02:12:20,020
Ryan Gosling is the goat if you watch drive. Yeah, I haven't actually seen drive. I just watched fall guy

1351
02:12:20,660 --> 02:12:22,660
with my parents

1352
02:12:22,980 --> 02:12:24,980
Your dad's a swift. Yes

1353
02:12:28,100 --> 02:12:33,300
I like he he was like, hey, you listen to Taylor's new album. I'm like dad. What the fuck he's like, you know

1354
02:12:34,660 --> 02:12:40,580
Comrade is a cat and he was like, so I'm sick of that. I'm like, what are you? I'm like dad, since when did you become a

1355
02:12:40,580 --> 02:12:44,420
Swiftie? He's like her new music bangs. I don't know what to tell you. I'm like, Jesus. Fuck dad

1356
02:12:46,420 --> 02:12:48,420
I'm not seeing drive. No

1357
02:12:49,300 --> 02:12:52,500
White women music is timeless. You're not wrong. You're not wrong

1358
02:12:54,180 --> 02:12:56,180
Again, my both of my parents have very

1359
02:12:56,740 --> 02:12:59,140
Range tastes and that's why I have very range tastes

1360
02:12:59,300 --> 02:13:02,500
But it's another reason why I don't like country because I never listened to country growing up

1361
02:13:02,660 --> 02:13:04,500
I listened to everything else besides country

1362
02:13:04,500 --> 02:13:08,740
I would go to bed listening to classical music because my mom would make sure I listened to classical music

1363
02:13:09,060 --> 02:13:12,420
And then I would go to school. My mom would play some 80s music

1364
02:13:13,060 --> 02:13:18,900
She would pick me up from home and she would play fucking breaking Benjamin in three days grace

1365
02:13:19,860 --> 02:13:25,860
Depending on the day that she had then my dad would play some like 80s or 90s rap and then

1366
02:13:26,820 --> 02:13:28,820
All like, yeah, I just I was very well

1367
02:13:29,300 --> 02:13:33,620
well around it and then I would listen to pop punk and just like alternative and metal

1368
02:13:35,220 --> 02:13:37,220
Um

1369
02:13:37,300 --> 02:13:41,780
My mom dated a guy who watched pitch perfect every week and played this soundtrack to him from work

1370
02:13:41,860 --> 02:13:47,380
Oh god, I would hate that although pitch perfect. Like it was a good movie. I did like pitch perfect the first one

1371
02:13:48,420 --> 02:13:53,780
Um, some country music is good. I know I have like one of my friends and it's funny because she's like very russian

1372
02:13:54,980 --> 02:13:56,980
Like very like think of icy

1373
02:13:57,620 --> 02:13:59,620
But like dialed up to a 10

1374
02:14:00,340 --> 02:14:04,660
And I see he's not even russian, but like they have the same accent though dialed up to a 10

1375
02:14:04,900 --> 02:14:06,900
and then

1376
02:14:07,220 --> 02:14:09,220
she

1377
02:14:09,220 --> 02:14:15,300
Really likes fucking country, but she's also she has like the bluntness that some like culturally russian people just have

1378
02:14:15,380 --> 02:14:20,260
They're just like very blunt and it can come across as like being a little abrasive

1379
02:14:20,260 --> 02:14:22,500
But she's a total sweetheart

1380
02:14:23,220 --> 02:14:27,140
And so she like listens to country and I'm just like this is so weird to me

1381
02:14:28,020 --> 02:14:30,020
I feel like you should be hating this

1382
02:14:30,340 --> 02:14:33,460
Basically ice with a vodka bottle in a cake

1383
02:14:34,980 --> 02:14:36,820
Yeah

1384
02:14:36,820 --> 02:14:39,060
George story they didn't last long. Thank thank god for her

1385
02:14:41,380 --> 02:14:43,460
Um, you have a live stream of just them

1386
02:14:46,660 --> 02:14:49,940
Yeah, I don't think I would do a live stream because they would probably just say

1387
02:14:51,300 --> 02:14:54,580
My name I did a collab once with some iRL friends

1388
02:14:55,140 --> 02:15:00,580
Um in my my uh past life and one of them called me by my first name, but nobody noticed

1389
02:15:02,980 --> 02:15:04,980
None of my audience notice

1390
02:15:06,180 --> 02:15:07,700
It was very funny

1391
02:15:07,700 --> 02:15:11,700
I was everybody went silent too because I had like asked them like okay. Don't use my name

1392
02:15:12,340 --> 02:15:14,340
Please look like the company

1393
02:15:15,140 --> 02:15:17,140
And uh

1394
02:15:17,620 --> 02:15:23,140
One of the one of the girls was just like hey, and I'm like doesn't respond

1395
02:15:24,740 --> 02:15:26,740
Um

1396
02:15:29,540 --> 02:15:31,620
Yeah, because sometimes this happens and I know like

1397
02:15:32,740 --> 02:15:34,740
I think my dad would be able to

1398
02:15:35,140 --> 02:15:37,860
It's call me by she be but I think my mom would

1399
02:15:38,660 --> 02:15:40,660
Find it hard

1400
02:15:41,860 --> 02:15:45,220
Because my dad gets it because he watched uh, he watches a lot of twitch streamers and stuff

1401
02:15:45,540 --> 02:15:48,660
I want to be surprised when my dad got into vTubers now. I have to ask him

1402
02:15:49,460 --> 02:15:52,180
I maybe I'll recommend him some vTubers. He's a very much

1403
02:15:52,180 --> 02:15:55,780
He only likes to watch like cod and stuff though and like sometimes fortnite

1404
02:15:58,020 --> 02:16:01,380
I don't know if there's any maybe I don't think yeah, no my dad doesn't like valent

1405
02:16:02,980 --> 02:16:06,260
Your dad watching ninja. No, he watched like nick mercs or something

1406
02:16:09,140 --> 02:16:12,580
I feel yeah, no, I know my dad would like probably really like vTubers if you watch them

1407
02:16:13,780 --> 02:16:19,940
Your dad the actually the best vTuber. I would see my dad getting a model like that one guy. That's like an orc

1408
02:16:23,140 --> 02:16:25,700
I have your dad sign up for the next holostars

1409
02:16:28,820 --> 02:16:33,220
That would actually be so sick though if my dad was at holostars

1410
02:16:34,180 --> 02:16:36,180
He would get in he was so get in

1411
02:16:37,060 --> 02:16:39,060
Is that a 14 year old boy?

1412
02:16:40,100 --> 02:16:42,100
Yes, no

1413
02:16:43,380 --> 02:16:46,740
That would be so funny. What's the male equivalent of a hag?

1414
02:16:46,980 --> 02:16:51,540
Because my mom is like definitely like peko mama

1415
02:16:54,100 --> 02:16:56,100
Um just like chill and shit

1416
02:16:57,540 --> 02:16:59,540
A gilf

1417
02:16:59,940 --> 02:17:05,860
She have a papa for holostars. I was like, oh, no, don't call my dad. Oh, do you say no? No, no, no, no

1418
02:17:06,100 --> 02:17:08,740
Stop it. Cut the cut the cut the cameras. No, thank you

1419
02:17:11,060 --> 02:17:13,060
I don't like that

1420
02:17:13,060 --> 02:17:15,060
Is the guysy

1421
02:17:15,540 --> 02:17:17,540
Adil

1422
02:17:18,420 --> 02:17:20,420
That's not the equivalent of a hag

1423
02:17:21,540 --> 02:17:24,660
Silver fox. I like that a zaddy

1424
02:17:27,700 --> 02:17:30,980
Can't wait to say daddy cotton mom 360 no scope a 12 year old

1425
02:17:31,460 --> 02:17:32,980
It's really funny because

1426
02:17:32,980 --> 02:17:36,100
Again, my dad has like a naturally very very very deep voice

1427
02:17:36,180 --> 02:17:39,380
But he when he's very excited just like me his voice pitches up

1428
02:17:40,020 --> 02:17:42,020
And I'd be like

1429
02:17:43,540 --> 02:17:47,780
Chackle hysterically and I'm just uh because like so he would game in the living room

1430
02:17:47,780 --> 02:17:53,540
And I would game in my bedroom and my mom would just be like chilling watching my dad play or like playing like some like

1431
02:17:53,620 --> 02:17:56,820
I don't know candy crush while she on her iPad all my dad plays games

1432
02:17:57,460 --> 02:17:59,060
um

1433
02:17:59,060 --> 02:18:01,300
And I would just hear him screaming in the next room

1434
02:18:02,820 --> 02:18:04,820
And my mom's like redacted

1435
02:18:05,300 --> 02:18:07,300
Be quiet. I'm trying to read

1436
02:18:08,180 --> 02:18:10,180
I'm trying to study the bible right now

1437
02:18:14,180 --> 02:18:18,660
My mom oh no, my mom my mom um, I don't know she she kind of like

1438
02:18:19,220 --> 02:18:23,060
I'm surprised she can sit there and kind of like do her own thing while my dad plays

1439
02:18:23,460 --> 02:18:24,420
um

1440
02:18:24,420 --> 02:18:30,820
Because once my dad knows he has an audience like if I'm sitting beside him like when I was like doing homework for school or something

1441
02:18:31,140 --> 02:18:33,140
That's he starts to narrate and commentate

1442
02:18:34,820 --> 02:18:36,820
As if he's a streamer

1443
02:18:37,540 --> 02:18:40,260
And it's it's very very amusing

1444
02:18:41,300 --> 02:18:47,620
So when he's serious, he's six five, but he's excited. He's five two. That's actually accurate. My dad is is that tall

1445
02:18:51,300 --> 02:18:53,860
Yeah, he's naturally a streamer. I guess that's where I inherited it from

1446
02:18:55,460 --> 02:18:58,500
So he would be natural in hollow stars. He'd be like, uh

1447
02:18:59,380 --> 02:19:02,260
Wait, no, is that Niji Sanji or is that hollow stars again? I don't watch

1448
02:19:03,300 --> 02:19:06,500
LVTubers. Um, what is his name like gold bullet?

1449
02:19:07,460 --> 02:19:09,460
Is he the brown who's the brown one?

1450
02:19:10,580 --> 02:19:12,580
Who are the tan

1451
02:19:14,420 --> 02:19:16,420
My dad's built different

1452
02:19:16,980 --> 02:19:20,100
I can see why you're crazy. Yeah, that's accurate

1453
02:19:21,540 --> 02:19:23,540
Gold bullet is hollow stars. Okay

1454
02:19:23,940 --> 02:19:28,020
There you go. Like he could be BFFs with gold bullet. That's the type of name my dad would pick for himself

1455
02:19:28,260 --> 02:19:30,260
Can we just talk about how stupid

1456
02:19:30,260 --> 02:19:35,940
Male names are like women's names are normal like she be cotton bum. Come on. That's an amazing name

1457
02:19:37,460 --> 02:19:39,460
Gold bullet

1458
02:19:40,180 --> 02:19:42,180
Vazelius bandage

1459
02:19:43,300 --> 02:19:45,460
Who is picking these fucking names?

1460
02:19:48,180 --> 02:19:50,180
Jesus

1461
02:19:51,780 --> 02:19:54,500
Gold bullet is an awesome name you take that back

1462
02:19:55,940 --> 02:19:57,940
Bandit, no it's not

1463
02:19:58,340 --> 02:20:00,340
Vantacro bringer

1464
02:20:00,340 --> 02:20:05,060
honestly, if they named him like something Vantacro that would have been cool like

1465
02:20:06,020 --> 02:20:08,500
Umohoshi Vantacro like that's fine

1466
02:20:09,460 --> 02:20:13,060
Hanabama is so normal. I don't know what you're talking about. Listen, I didn't get to pick my name either

1467
02:20:13,700 --> 02:20:18,180
Because they I'm pretty sure they get to pick their names and design their characters. Don't they or is hollow

1468
02:20:19,460 --> 02:20:25,220
Is hollow also cast for character? Do Niji and hollow allow the talent to make to make your own character?

1469
02:20:26,820 --> 02:20:30,660
Shibuya just me as uh, what's his name cyborg?

1470
02:20:35,380 --> 02:20:39,940
Vantacro bringer. Yeah, that's what I thought. Yeah, Vantacro bringer perfect calm van

1471
02:20:42,100 --> 02:20:44,100
Vantacro bringer

1472
02:20:44,500 --> 02:20:48,900
You really got bum in your name. Yeah, because I got a fat ass. I'm gonna stick in your face and sit on it

1473
02:20:48,900 --> 02:20:50,900
Smother you shut the fuck up

1474
02:20:51,380 --> 02:20:53,380
No, only the second third offense. Oh, okay

1475
02:20:53,700 --> 02:20:55,700
Streamers pick the names

1476
02:20:56,900 --> 02:20:58,900
Um, you know, yeah mercy picked her name

1477
02:20:59,380 --> 02:21:01,380
She was able to pick her name because

1478
02:21:01,380 --> 02:21:03,380
Karam beat

1479
02:21:03,380 --> 02:21:04,660
Was just not

1480
02:21:04,660 --> 02:21:06,660
Not having a good time

1481
02:21:07,860 --> 02:21:10,100
Shibuya's gyat. No, my gyat is non-existent

1482
02:21:12,340 --> 02:21:17,860
Um, I remember like yeah, uh, Strani asked me if I wanted to like change anything like I

1483
02:21:19,060 --> 02:21:21,060
I could have changed like my logo

1484
02:21:21,460 --> 02:21:25,300
I could have changed I couldn't change like my character obviously, but she's like is

1485
02:21:26,020 --> 02:21:28,740
Is your name cool? And I'm like, yes, I thought it was hilarious

1486
02:21:29,540 --> 02:21:34,100
I was like, I kind of liked that. It was very close to being

1487
02:21:35,620 --> 02:21:38,900
Nijisanji holo stars level of out of pocket

1488
02:21:40,340 --> 02:21:44,980
Strani, so yeah, oh most of like like you guys know I'm getting a tan toggle

1489
02:21:47,140 --> 02:21:49,140
You guys know I'm getting a tan toggle

1490
02:21:50,420 --> 02:21:52,740
Um spoiler. I'm also changing my eye color

1491
02:21:52,900 --> 02:21:54,900
I

1492
02:21:55,460 --> 02:22:00,740
Know you might not like it, but I might only use I don't know if it's gonna be only with the tan toggle that my eye color changes

1493
02:22:01,700 --> 02:22:02,900
Um

1494
02:22:02,900 --> 02:22:06,980
I wanted to do I know nobody has blue eyes in our gen

1495
02:22:08,500 --> 02:22:10,740
Nobody has blue eyes, so I'm like give me blue eyes

1496
02:22:12,100 --> 02:22:13,060
because

1497
02:22:13,060 --> 02:22:15,060
Yeah, mercies are reddish

1498
02:22:15,700 --> 02:22:17,940
Strani's are like greenish yellow purple

1499
02:22:18,900 --> 02:22:24,500
Uh me and Azura have this and I see have the same colored eyes and um

1500
02:22:25,220 --> 02:22:27,220
Emmys are also purple

1501
02:22:29,060 --> 02:22:34,420
Yeah, so I'm gonna do instead of blue eyes white dragon. I'm tan she be blue eyes

Getting glasses. I just like get an asset of glasses. I don't know

1505
02:22:44,340 --> 02:22:49,620
But I don't know I have to I don't know if it's gonna be a permanent thing that I have blue eyes

1506
02:22:50,500 --> 02:22:51,620
um

1507
02:22:51,620 --> 02:22:53,620
Yeah

02:22:54,420 --> 02:22:55,620
No my gold eyes

1509
02:22:55,620 --> 02:22:57,460
You know, I love the gold eyes

1510
02:22:57,460 --> 02:23:04,180
It just it just looked really weird with the tan skin tone to be honest with you because like uh, I was telling her

1511
02:23:04,180 --> 02:23:09,140
I'm like, oh because our my the artists in the regular are working on it right now and um

1512
02:23:10,100 --> 02:23:14,580
I don't know when they're gonna be done. I might be like a month or so. So you will not have

1513
02:23:15,540 --> 02:23:17,540
tan she be quite yet

1514
02:23:18,340 --> 02:23:22,500
um, because they're also working on cover-ups for me and Azura I think but um

1515
02:23:24,020 --> 02:23:27,220
I was messing around like okay. Maybe if I had this sort of skin tone

1516
02:23:27,860 --> 02:23:29,860
I was trying to be close to my normal skin tone

1517
02:23:29,940 --> 02:23:34,180
But then I was like I was holding up my hands to the thing and I'm like, holy fuck. I'm so pale

1518
02:23:34,340 --> 02:23:39,780
So I kind of made myself just a little bit darker like when I'm in the like when I've gone to the beach

1519
02:23:41,460 --> 02:23:44,580
Rather than when I haven't left my home for like a year

1520
02:23:48,020 --> 02:23:52,900
Tan she be I don't I don't know if I will be tan by monetization. Who knows?

1521
02:23:53,780 --> 02:23:58,340
Um, but yeah, the the gold, you know what? Fuck it. I'll just show you. I'll just show you the screenshot

1522
02:23:58,420 --> 02:24:00,420
I sent to strongy and I don't really care

1523
02:24:05,140 --> 02:24:07,140
Do-do-do

1524
02:24:08,100 --> 02:24:12,020
Because I was I kind of made the undertone of my skin a little bit too red

1525
02:24:13,300 --> 02:24:18,980
Um, because I like I kind of so my tan skin kind of does clash with my color palette a bit

1526
02:24:19,700 --> 02:24:22,980
Um, like if my red was a little bit brighter it might stand out more

1527
02:24:25,700 --> 02:24:29,860
Because my mixture because like uh, I'm like a mixture of monochrome and

1528
02:24:30,820 --> 02:24:31,860
um

1529
02:24:31,860 --> 02:24:37,700
And my my main color is red and that I feel like that works extremely well with my hair

1530
02:24:38,580 --> 02:24:40,580
and my um

1531
02:24:43,700 --> 02:24:49,060
My like the yeah in my eyes, but when I'm tan it just doesn't

1532
02:24:50,420 --> 02:24:52,420
It just looks too red. I don't

1533
02:24:52,980 --> 02:24:56,420
I don't know how to explain it to you because like it's just like it's all color theory really

1534
02:24:56,740 --> 02:24:58,740
That's why you see a lot of more like tan

1535
02:24:58,900 --> 02:25:00,900
Um

1536
02:25:01,060 --> 02:25:04,660
She was with like if they have warmer colors in their palette

1537
02:25:05,140 --> 02:25:07,140
It's like an accent color

1538
02:25:07,460 --> 02:25:12,100
Rather than like a main color, but you know, I'm completely completely wrong or it's normally like cool colored tones

1539
02:25:12,580 --> 02:25:16,020
It's really depending on like what what type of black you are, you know

1540
02:25:18,580 --> 02:25:20,580
I mean, where's the screenshot?

1541
02:25:21,540 --> 02:25:23,540
I

1542
02:25:25,300 --> 02:25:28,340
Was like this makes like I look just like fucking burnt

1543
02:25:32,500 --> 02:25:35,300
I look sunburned a little bit

1544
02:25:37,380 --> 02:25:41,140
Um, and that's with the blue eyes. So it looks it looks pretty nice

1545
02:25:41,700 --> 02:25:46,260
I realize however the eye the layers on my uh, my right eye

1546
02:25:46,980 --> 02:25:48,980
We're not cut properly

1547
02:25:49,220 --> 02:25:53,300
They were not separated at the same as my left eye. So I couldn't get quite the

1548
02:25:53,940 --> 02:25:55,940
color that I wanted for the

1549
02:25:55,940 --> 02:25:57,940
for the eye tone

1550
02:26:00,180 --> 02:26:03,300
Yeah, they look grayish it's it's never meant to be a blue

1551
02:26:05,140 --> 02:26:10,740
Die my hair. I don't know but I like I like the blonde like blonde with tan skin looks so good

1552
02:26:11,700 --> 02:26:14,660
Like so I wish I could because I used to uh, I'll be honest with you

1553
02:26:14,980 --> 02:26:21,060
Um rtx she be I used to have icy blonde hair and it looked fucking gorgeous against my skin

1554
02:26:22,260 --> 02:26:24,260
Like a fine grilled wagyu

1555
02:26:25,540 --> 02:26:29,300
Yeah blonde and tan and like I feel like it fits better with the gyaru, you know

1556
02:26:30,580 --> 02:26:32,580
If it's way better with the gyaru

1557
02:26:33,380 --> 02:26:35,380
But you'll notice

1558
02:26:35,620 --> 02:26:37,620
Like you'll see like how my

1559
02:26:38,580 --> 02:26:42,100
Like my my on my color palette needs to kind of be brightened up

1560
02:26:42,740 --> 02:26:47,220
In terms of like my reds seem to be a bit more intense because they're like a lighter red

1561
02:26:47,300 --> 02:26:49,300
So they need to be a little bit brighter. I think

1562
02:26:50,500 --> 02:26:52,500
You know

1563
02:26:53,140 --> 02:26:54,420
Um

1564
02:26:54,420 --> 02:26:56,580
And let me show you the other screenshot I took

1565
02:26:57,540 --> 02:26:59,780
Yeah, I couldn't fucking get the eyes right

1566
02:27:02,900 --> 02:27:04,900
Because of the layering issue

1567
02:27:05,380 --> 02:27:10,260
Because it like just darkened the top my eyes look fucking pitch black

1568
02:27:16,820 --> 02:27:18,820
Yeah

1569
02:27:20,500 --> 02:27:22,500
Which way western man

1570
02:27:23,940 --> 02:27:27,220
Um, I actually like me with darker eyes to be honest with you

1571
02:27:28,980 --> 02:27:33,460
I look very nefarious. I feel like I look more bunny like especially when I have my little

1572
02:27:34,900 --> 02:27:40,180
I probably will have like my uwu mouth as a permanent thing because I feel like it shows off that I'm like

1573
02:27:40,660 --> 02:27:43,780
More bunny like because like it makes my teeth look a certain way

1574
02:27:45,060 --> 02:27:49,940
It's both an option. Well, it's gonna be a toggle again. I am going to be she be copper bum

1575
02:27:51,620 --> 02:27:53,620
This is she be copper bum right here

1576
02:27:54,260 --> 02:27:57,780
Does she be copper bum just like copper cat mouse

1577
02:27:58,100 --> 02:28:06,820
But yeah, I think like look at don't I look like such a fucking succubus in this picture like god damn

1578
02:28:09,700 --> 02:28:13,700
I was debating whether or not to like add another mole somewhere too. I think that could be really cute

1579
02:28:14,100 --> 02:28:16,100
Well, like I'll probably do that in the 2.0

1580
02:28:17,860 --> 02:28:21,380
It's copper bum single. Yeah, but she does not want to get with you

1581
02:28:24,020 --> 02:28:26,020
Um

1582
02:28:26,740 --> 02:28:28,740
Madam only

1583
02:28:28,980 --> 02:28:33,140
Uh, my tan lines would go. Yes, like I feel like tan lines would be really good with it too

1584
02:28:35,860 --> 02:28:37,860
Let me critical it

1585
02:28:39,220 --> 02:28:41,220
Out of tail I have a tail

1586
02:28:41,460 --> 02:28:44,580
You just can't see it. I have a bunny tail guys

1587
02:28:45,860 --> 02:28:47,620
But crazy thing

1588
02:28:47,620 --> 02:28:50,100
I can't turn around and show it to you

1589
02:28:50,100 --> 02:28:52,100
So

1590
02:28:52,260 --> 02:28:56,260
I don't know how you expect me to show a bunny tail when they're a little bit

1591
02:28:57,140 --> 02:28:59,140
They're like tucked in

1592
02:29:01,220 --> 02:29:03,460
Yes, I'm a fucking rabbit. Of course I have a tail

1593
02:29:06,900 --> 02:29:08,900
Yes, I was telling um

1594
02:29:09,780 --> 02:29:14,580
Strawny to tell the artist that I need to like I need I'll need to change my ear

1595
02:29:15,140 --> 02:29:21,540
Um color because I couldn't do it because the the ear the inner ear isn't separated from the the

1596
02:29:21,940 --> 02:29:25,060
Like the fur part of the ear. So I couldn't change the color of that

1597
02:29:26,820 --> 02:29:30,100
You can't believe you're coming. I was trans Rachel. Call me Rachel Dozel

1598
02:29:31,620 --> 02:29:34,660
Call me Rachel Dozel. I am trans Rachel

1599
02:29:39,380 --> 02:29:41,380
I'm sorry you got yeeted for that

1600
02:29:42,020 --> 02:29:48,020
Uh any alt costable I want to do ghiattu naturally. I would love to do ghiattu school girl. Um

1601
02:29:50,260 --> 02:29:52,260
I really don't probably like

02:29:52,500 --> 02:29:57,700
Moff not like mafia boss look because I kind of already got that going on with the office wear my pops kala

1603
02:29:58,260 --> 02:30:00,260

1605
02:30:04,660 --> 02:30:08,420
More madame like like victorian madame brothel owner

Who is in Paris? We finally know the answer to this

1607
02:30:15,540 --> 02:30:17,540
Who is in Paris?

Ojusama, yeah

1612
02:30:33,460 --> 02:30:37,140
And to be honest, I would honestly like a cute and funny toggle as well at some point

1613
02:30:38,820 --> 02:30:43,540
An old victorian child outfit. Yeah, I just want to wear victor like a dead victorian child

1614
02:30:43,540 --> 02:30:46,260
That's just eaten pop rocks for the first time and couldn't handle it

1615
02:30:47,860 --> 02:30:53,220
It's funny. I almost look blurry because the way this screenshot is in the back that I'm darker

1616
02:30:54,660 --> 02:31:00,340
Like uh makes it look like I'm like blurry and then the in the background like she's in the foreground

1617
02:31:03,060 --> 02:31:06,980
I'm in the hair watching you kiss her

1618
02:31:08,420 --> 02:31:10,420
Oh

1619
02:31:10,580 --> 02:31:12,900
Yeah, I can't keep secrets because I just get so excited

1620
02:31:14,500 --> 02:31:20,340
Because I was like I was like, oh, I should keep it a surprise. No, I can't I can't keep stuff surprises

1621
02:31:20,580 --> 02:31:23,780
Yeah, I was talking about it. A lot of my friends were also like, why are you white?

1622
02:31:23,860 --> 02:31:27,060
I'm like, well, I am half white, but I get what you're trying to say

1623
02:31:31,380 --> 02:31:36,420
But uh, yeah, yadu rabbit yadu dom schoolgirl 100%

02:31:37,140 --> 02:31:43,300
Yeah, that would be so it need a comically large hat. Maybe like a lady Demetresque s style

02:31:44,020 --> 02:31:47,140
Oh, that's more like a Zura because she's like fucking nine feet tall

1626
02:31:48,740 --> 02:31:55,060
Any other secrets you want to share? No, don't look at me like that. Um, don't worry. I'll be enthusiastic even we're already knowing

1627
02:31:55,620 --> 02:32:00,580

1641
02:33:23,380 --> 02:33:25,380

Love that because everything else fit fine. Um, I might have to get it like actually professionally fitted to me

1643
02:33:34,020 --> 02:33:36,020
and um

1644
02:33:36,260 --> 02:33:41,140
Uh, I was just I just was wearing a t-shirt and I'm wearing the same. I'll actually no I'm wearing different pants now

1646
02:33:46,900 --> 02:33:52,180
Jeans and flip flops. That's all I was wearing and then now I'm just I've just switched to sweatpants

1647
02:33:53,860 --> 02:33:58,100
Somebody asked me what color today and I just uh, I didn't I forgot to answer. It's uh black

1651
02:34:15,540 --> 02:34:18,820
And they stole 60 bucks right out of my under my nose

1652
02:34:20,100 --> 02:34:23,780
I'm gray sweat so you could see a swaying under there

1657
02:34:46,420 --> 02:34:47,460
toggles

1658
02:34:47,460 --> 02:34:50,660
he should make like a sweatpants toggle and then

1659
02:34:51,460 --> 02:34:56,020
If you're a male vtuber and you use a toggle you can like toggle on like having a massive dick

1660
02:34:57,460 --> 02:34:59,140
It's like the outline

1661
02:34:59,140 --> 02:35:03,060
Or like I could use it and like I can have because it's like my strap

1662
02:35:03,220 --> 02:35:07,460
Also, by the way, are you guys asking me to like put a strap on my throne? Do you want me to do that?

1663
02:35:08,100 --> 02:35:10,100
Apparently some of you have asked me to do that

1664
02:35:12,580 --> 02:35:16,340
Because i'm like I don't have one because like who the fuck am I gonna use it on my cat. No

1665
02:35:17,780 --> 02:35:19,780
A cat will do

1666
02:35:20,740 --> 02:35:24,180
A bold toggle hell yeah untuck my queen

1667
02:35:24,180 --> 02:35:30,820
So what's the fabric? It's just pee. It's not prey. It's pee

02:35:32,420 --> 02:35:34,420
I mean if you want

1669
02:35:35,140 --> 02:35:40,020
I'm surprised no one did a toggle asset based on that one sus are what guy was dressing pulling his pants

I have not seen glow in the dark stockings. I really like the cat stockings. I used to have a pair

1699
02:37:47,860 --> 02:37:52,820
But I spilled lipstick on them. I dropped my one of my um lip glosses on them

Casually watching these bottoms what bottoms?

02:38:40,420 --> 02:38:46,820
Um, I want to do that with the veal or girls and vines, but I can't remember how to do to do that because I've done that before

1711
02:38:47,540 --> 02:38:48,900

02:38:48,900 --> 02:38:50,900
I remember I did like a whole

1713
02:38:51,220 --> 02:38:57,700

Oh, you know what's a good idea. Oh, let's answer some maros answer some maros

Wouldn't that be great if we answered some maros?

1718
02:39:21,460 --> 02:39:36,660
Did I ever answer this question? What are fun things do with crowd control? I don't know. You could fucking kill me. I think I answered that

1719
02:39:36,740 --> 02:39:38,500
I think I said that

1720
02:39:38,500 --> 02:39:41,460
Sorry, I was looking at to see if somebody accidentally gave me something that I missed

1721

02:40:31,140 --> 02:40:35,060

1733
02:40:44,500 --> 02:40:46,500
In conceivable

1734
02:40:49,620 --> 02:40:52,980
Because like I'll have people like spam me with the same one and I'm like dude

1735
02:40:54,100 --> 02:40:57,300
I'm doing something. I'm trying to do something because like

1736
02:40:58,500 --> 02:41:01,220
I usually sit on the computer for eight hours a day

1737
02:41:02,180 --> 02:41:04,900
And I mean doing the same fucking thing when I go back to work

1738
02:41:06,020 --> 02:41:08,020
It's like sometimes I need to take a break from the screen

1739
02:41:09,380 --> 02:41:11,380
Sometimes I need to put my phone away

1740
02:41:12,020 --> 02:41:15,700
And just be a veg on the couch and you know watch the boys or read a book

1741
02:41:17,060 --> 02:41:19,060
Go outside touch grass work out

1742
02:41:21,700 --> 02:41:28,980
So I try to do that sometimes I'm can't I can't just keep refreshing my maros being able to jump on them and respond to everyone

1743
02:41:29,380 --> 02:41:30,500
Thank you

1744
02:41:30,500 --> 02:41:33,620
What's a marrow a marrow is a marshmallow a marshmallow?

1745
02:41:33,860 --> 02:41:34,420
um

1746
02:41:34,420 --> 02:41:41,540
So marshmallow dash qa dot com is a japanese hosted site where you can send anonymous messages to usually your favorite creators

1747
02:41:41,540 --> 02:41:46,260
That's what most uh btbs it most of the time in the past people use curious cat

1748
02:41:46,580 --> 02:41:51,380
But because that site is so broken and sometimes has a lot of downtime and does not work

1749
02:41:51,460 --> 02:41:53,460
We do not use it because it's not reliable

1750
02:41:54,020 --> 02:41:58,980
So stop complaining as well that we don't use fucking curious cat. I don't care

1751
02:41:59,700 --> 02:42:01,700
When are you gonna understand? I don't care

1752
02:42:02,900 --> 02:42:07,380
Anytime you complain and we've already explained to you the reasons why and they're you know

1753
02:42:07,940 --> 02:42:10,580
Appropriate reasons and you're like yeah, but still I don't care

1754
02:42:12,420 --> 02:42:14,420
What's grass

1755
02:42:14,500 --> 02:42:16,500
Does the crap you have to do because you know

1756
02:42:17,380 --> 02:42:19,700
You need to be yes, so you need to logged in

1757
02:42:20,420 --> 02:42:22,420
Yeah, that's an all anonymous

1758
02:42:22,900 --> 02:42:24,660
et cetera

1759
02:42:24,660 --> 02:42:26,660
um, okay, so this is

1760
02:42:28,660 --> 02:42:30,660
I also can't read japanese

1761
02:42:31,860 --> 02:42:38,260
I'll do the most uh recent one. Well, not the most recent the latest the ones that are the furthest in the past

1762
02:42:41,300 --> 02:42:43,300
Can I touch your ears, please madam

1763
02:42:44,500 --> 02:42:46,100
Uh, no

1764
02:42:46,100 --> 02:42:51,780
They're very sensitive. I don't like them touched just like my tail. Please do not tug on my tail or tug on my ears

1765
02:42:52,180 --> 02:42:54,180
Thank you

1766
02:42:55,620 --> 02:42:57,620

Okay, I'm literally gonna go through all of them today

Yes, that did happen congratulations, um

I'm you know, I I've had a lot of people I'm the first person

1781
02:44:10,980 --> 02:44:13,460
I'm gonna probably cut this this portion of the stream out

1782
02:44:13,460 --> 02:44:17,540
But I kind of want to go over uh maros and stuff because it's just fun talking about maros

1783
02:44:18,580 --> 02:44:20,580
um

1784
02:44:21,460 --> 02:44:27,940
I'm happy that a lot of you feel comfortable enough with me to share certain sides of yourself that you've not done before with other either

Mamosa leave you're too young to see this

You're too young

1800
02:45:30,740 --> 02:45:33,540
Um, how about sometimes it's very annoying trying to respond

1801
02:45:46,980 --> 02:45:48,980
Boop boop boop boop

1802
02:45:49,860 --> 02:45:52,260
Isn't that guy who plays aquaman, huh?

You're so fucking with me right now you are not in your 30s. I do not believe you

1806
02:46:11,220 --> 02:46:16,340
If you're in your 30s, I'm 56

1807
02:46:22,100 --> 02:46:24,100
Hag love

1808
02:46:25,060 --> 02:46:29,220
Still 20 years younger than madam. That's what I mean. That's foul

1809
02:46:31,540 --> 02:46:34,340
I identify as 25. Yeah, I'm 56 guys

1810
02:46:36,660 --> 02:46:39,300
She meant she's in her threes. She's divisible by three

1811
02:46:40,100 --> 02:46:42,100
Okay, um

1812
02:46:47,780 --> 02:46:49,460
Okay, this one I can say outside

1813
02:46:49,460 --> 02:46:53,540
Hi, she be I've been head over heels for you since you spat in our collective mouths in your debut

1814
02:46:53,860 --> 02:46:58,980
Talk about a power move. I've only become more impressed in enamored as time gone on because of your chill dorky vibes

1815
02:46:58,980 --> 02:47:00,980
Your maculite memory and your rutless

1816
02:47:01,540 --> 02:47:02,900
I can't see that

1817
02:47:02,900 --> 02:47:04,260
What does that mean?

1818
02:47:04,260 --> 02:47:06,260
Say sexiness. I don't know probably

1819
02:47:06,820 --> 02:47:10,660
Um, it feels like such a rarity to see someone who doesn't just play a dom in role plays

1820
02:47:10,660 --> 02:47:12,820
But actually and is and loves being dominant

1821
02:47:12,980 --> 02:47:16,420
No shade to the people who are putting on an act is still wonderful content

1822
02:47:16,500 --> 02:47:18,900
But I think it hits different when you know that the words are heartfelt

1823
02:47:19,460 --> 02:47:24,100
Have you had much real life experience doming people? And if so, are there any particular events or scenes to stand out to?

1824
02:47:24,100 --> 02:47:26,100
You've been da-da-da-da

1825
02:47:26,260 --> 02:47:29,700
Uh stream audio is really good at both. It's funny because you're wrong

1826
02:47:29,940 --> 02:47:31,940
Um

1827
02:47:34,420 --> 02:47:36,420
Uh, I've been very transparent

1828
02:47:37,140 --> 02:47:41,140
That I'm normally a switch, but again, I am very knowledgeable

1829
02:47:42,340 --> 02:47:44,180
with um

1830
02:47:44,180 --> 02:47:46,180
That side of things

1831
02:47:46,660 --> 02:47:50,180
Uh, I have not had real life experience doing that

1832
02:47:50,980 --> 02:47:52,180
Um

1833
02:47:52,180 --> 02:47:53,540
Sorry

1834
02:47:53,540 --> 02:47:55,540
Sorry to break the kayfabe for you

1835
02:47:56,660 --> 02:47:59,460
Um, but I am realizing

1836
02:47:59,700 --> 02:48:02,580
As I am learning more and you guys are teaching me

1837
02:48:03,220 --> 02:48:04,820
that

1838
02:48:04,820 --> 02:48:07,220
I am really fucking enjoying it. I uh

1839
02:48:08,100 --> 02:48:13,220
Like what I did earlier in stream today where I kind of just bitched at you guys and bossed you around

1840
02:48:13,860 --> 02:48:18,260
Oh, that was nice. That made me feel very good. You have no idea. I'm telling strongy right now

1841
02:48:19,620 --> 02:48:21,620
But yeah, um

1842
02:48:21,700 --> 02:48:23,700
I don't yeah, no, I don't

1843
02:48:23,780 --> 02:48:25,780
I do

1844
02:48:26,260 --> 02:48:28,660
I do put on the act sometimes

1845
02:48:28,740 --> 02:48:32,820
But the majority of the time late like when I first like the first like two days

1846
02:48:32,900 --> 02:48:36,020
I was putting on an act then after that I was like, holy shit. I actually like this

1847
02:48:36,580 --> 02:48:38,580
Like I actually don't mind this

1848
02:48:40,180 --> 02:48:42,180
Um, and if that bothers you

1849
02:48:43,780 --> 02:48:45,780
I'm sorry

1850
02:48:46,340 --> 02:48:48,340
But I don't care

1851
02:48:48,340 --> 02:48:50,740
If it bothers you then I'm normally a switch

1852
02:48:51,620 --> 02:48:54,180
I don't care. I really don't

1853
02:48:55,140 --> 02:48:58,180
Cry I want you to cry. Can you record yourself crying to me?

1854
02:48:59,060 --> 02:49:02,500
So I can fucking laugh at your stupid little boy tears. Thank you

1855
02:49:05,540 --> 02:49:07,540
Yes

1856
02:49:09,140 --> 02:49:11,140
Um

1857
02:49:12,020 --> 02:49:14,020
Madam if I wait

1858
02:49:16,180 --> 02:49:18,180
I can't read that out loud um

1859
02:49:19,860 --> 02:49:23,380
Is there anything particular I want in videos and go follow your heart, dude

1860
02:49:24,020 --> 02:49:26,020
I get a lot of questions asking me to

1861
02:49:27,380 --> 02:49:29,380
Um, you're more of a bully

1862
02:49:29,860 --> 02:49:32,820
Yeah, because that's how how am I supposed to do?

1863
02:49:34,660 --> 02:49:36,660
More dom related things

1864
02:49:37,780 --> 02:49:39,940
When one this is not an actual

1865
02:49:40,820 --> 02:49:42,660
Dom sub relationship

1866
02:49:42,660 --> 02:49:48,260
We have not gone through like actual consent forms. I don't know what you like. I don't know what you're into

1867
02:49:48,260 --> 02:49:53,380
I can't inflict pain upon you. I can't do the acts you're asking me to it's all audio

1868
02:49:54,100 --> 02:49:56,100
I am so limited

1869
02:49:56,660 --> 02:49:58,820
In my character with what I can do

1870
02:50:01,620 --> 02:50:03,620
Whereas I see

1871
02:50:04,020 --> 02:50:08,340
She can do age play just fine. It's not hard for her to do that. It's easier to like

1872
02:50:09,860 --> 02:50:14,820
Regress to a child than it is to an act like one which was appealing to her fan base

1873
02:50:15,540 --> 02:50:17,540
than to

1874
02:50:18,500 --> 02:50:21,460
Have me pretend like do you want me to pretend to punch you like?

1875
02:50:23,860 --> 02:50:25,220
If you

1876
02:50:25,220 --> 02:50:26,980
can tell me

1877
02:50:26,980 --> 02:50:28,980
How to be better

1878
02:50:29,620 --> 02:50:32,340
Within audio related stuff perfect

1879
02:50:33,140 --> 02:50:36,340
Or on stream someone made a very good. I I um

1880
02:50:37,140 --> 02:50:41,060
I read it this morning and I took the advice someone said to me

1881
02:50:41,940 --> 02:50:45,380
You should use your crop intermittently and wave it in front of the mic

1882
02:50:45,860 --> 02:50:52,100
And make the user anticipate and not know when you're gonna hit it and I'm like that is perfect. Thank you

1883
02:50:53,540 --> 02:50:55,380
Thank you

1884
02:50:55,380 --> 02:50:57,380
That is constructive

1885
02:50:57,380 --> 02:50:59,380
advice

1886
02:51:02,580 --> 02:51:07,940
Like I'm like that's perfect for a 3do for like whoa, where am I gonna go? Oh, whoops like

1887
02:51:10,260 --> 02:51:12,500
And so I try to do a little bit of that with this microphone

1888
02:51:12,500 --> 02:51:16,500
But I didn't really work that well because you can't really hear the movement in front of the mic

1889
02:51:17,940 --> 02:51:19,460
um

1890
02:51:19,460 --> 02:51:23,620
So yeah, see thank you. I can instruct you to do stuff

1891
02:51:24,420 --> 02:51:26,420
um

1892
02:51:27,460 --> 02:51:29,460
I don't really

1893
02:51:29,540 --> 02:51:36,020
Oh, why did I read punch ourselves? He said punish ourselves. Um, and I have done that

1894
02:51:38,100 --> 02:51:40,100
People like ask me

1895
02:51:40,420 --> 02:51:46,260
Um, hey, like what can I do and I'm like, okay, you can do this for a week and you can do that

1896
02:51:46,580 --> 02:51:50,260
But if you're not sending Maro's asking for that stuff, I'm not gonna purposefully

1897
02:51:51,140 --> 02:51:53,620
I'm not gonna tell you. I don't I haven't fucking talked to you yet

1898
02:51:58,180 --> 02:52:01,060
She be uni experiment with audio. Thanks

1899
02:52:02,100 --> 02:52:03,460
um

1900
02:52:03,460 --> 02:52:05,460
You should the you should

1901
02:52:05,460 --> 02:52:07,460
Pointing the circle to your belly. What?

1902
02:52:07,940 --> 02:52:10,740
I know you folks are going to go above and beyond when it comes to instruction

1903
02:52:10,980 --> 02:52:13,780
Yeah, like now like if you want me to get instructions

1904
02:52:14,260 --> 02:52:20,020
Give me some ideas. What sort of instructions would you like me to give because so far I can only think of preventing you to do

1905
02:52:22,020 --> 02:52:27,380
Um, like straw in your cuddles if you want me to pretend like to tell you don't straw in your cuddles for a week

1906
02:52:31,300 --> 02:52:33,300
And I have done that

1907
02:52:33,300 --> 02:52:39,700
Do you listen? No, you know often I'll be like, don't do this and people in my maros are like, oh, I did it and I'm like

1908
02:52:41,380 --> 02:52:43,140
Okay

1909
02:52:43,140 --> 02:52:46,900
Oh, please punish me. No, you can't even take a fucking simple

1910
02:52:47,380 --> 02:52:50,100
Direction. I told you don't straw in your cuddles for a week

1911
02:52:51,060 --> 02:52:54,260
And you straw in your cuddles and you want me to punish you because you

1912
02:52:54,660 --> 02:52:58,340
No, your punishment is I don't tell you to do anything because you're already a disappointment

1913
02:52:59,140 --> 02:53:06,500
She'd be so my mom is poor. Can you tell me to do my dishes?

1914
02:53:08,500 --> 02:53:10,500
Go do your dishes

1915
02:53:10,500 --> 02:53:13,620
Turn off my stream. Do your dishes, please. Do you want me to be your mom?

1916
02:53:14,500 --> 02:53:16,500
Clean your fucking room, jimmy

1919
02:53:28,100 --> 02:53:30,100

If you're memeing, I don't care if you're not memeing that sucks

1922
02:53:42,020 --> 02:53:47,620
Thought I was terminally online dude. I'm a vtuber. I literally I live on the internet. What do you expect?

1923
02:53:48,500 --> 02:53:50,020

1924
02:53:50,020 --> 02:53:54,500
Anyways, if I was to do if I was to do a video of me straw in my cuddles

1925
02:53:55,220 --> 02:53:57,220
Yeah, I kind of already answered that

1926
02:53:58,340 --> 02:54:00,340
Um here me

1927
02:54:03,860 --> 02:54:05,860
This is a perfect

1928
02:54:18,180 --> 02:54:22,180
If you want to send me a video of you wearing color and leash go ahead

1929
02:54:22,500 --> 02:54:28,500
Say how awesome I am go ahead do it

1930
02:54:31,940 --> 02:54:33,940
Do it you won't

1931
02:54:34,580 --> 02:54:36,980
Go buy the collar right now go on amazon

1932
02:54:37,700 --> 02:54:42,980
Buy yourself a I even when I first started streaming. I told people to get a collar

1933
02:54:44,100 --> 02:54:47,220
Because you are my dogs. You are my pets and none of you fucking did that

1934
02:54:47,940 --> 02:54:51,540
By the way, I think people thought I was just joking. I wasn't joking

1935
02:54:52,340 --> 02:54:54,340
because

1936
02:54:54,900 --> 02:54:57,300
I'm like, oh because like collaring is a very

1937
02:54:58,260 --> 02:55:00,260
intense like

1938
02:55:01,140 --> 02:55:08,340
But respectful deep connection with your dom when they you get collared

1939
02:55:10,740 --> 02:55:17,620
And none of you fucking got collared and when I so look up look up what collaring is in the btsm community

1940
02:55:17,940 --> 02:55:21,460
Because you're thinking of like wearing a dog collar. No you get yourself a necklace

1941
02:55:21,460 --> 02:55:23,460
It can be you know discreet

1942
02:55:24,180 --> 02:55:26,180
It can be something

1943
02:55:26,900 --> 02:55:32,420
Simple or you can wear like a bracelet or something just to show people that you are owned

1944
02:55:33,300 --> 02:55:35,140
by me

1945
02:55:35,140 --> 02:55:37,140
I am your owner

1946
02:55:39,700 --> 02:55:44,020
If I was a color what color would I be I don't know like red and it's only everywhere

1947
02:55:44,020 --> 02:55:53,300
First Gunpla build and you have to respond to me about how much time I'm wasting with childish activities. Oh, yeah, sure. Don't worry about that

1948
02:55:55,780 --> 02:55:57,540
I know I love but she's

1949
02:55:57,540 --> 02:56:03,700
If one is broke could a dark metallic. Yeah, that's fine. Like it doesn't have to be like it could be like if you

1950
02:56:04,500 --> 02:56:08,020
Have a necklace that you already own and it means a lot to you

1951
02:56:09,940 --> 02:56:13,140
You can use that as a representation you can put it on

1952
02:56:14,980 --> 02:56:16,980
And that can be your collar

1953
02:56:20,740 --> 02:56:23,700
It doesn't have to be like a fancy collar

1954
02:56:23,780 --> 02:56:28,020
It doesn't have to be like one of those like stainless steel crazy things with a lock

1955
02:56:28,420 --> 02:56:32,260
You can it could usually it's sometimes they've been a lot more discreet

1956
02:56:33,940 --> 02:56:35,940
When I was doing research on it

1957
02:56:36,180 --> 02:56:38,100
um

1958
02:56:38,100 --> 02:56:43,300
And I saw like one girl because I was just like on tick-tock because I was like btsm tips. Hello

1959
02:56:43,780 --> 02:56:46,900
and one girl literally her uh

1960
02:56:48,500 --> 02:56:54,020
Her I don't know if it was a freaking husband or boyfriend. Um her Dom just got her a normal necklace

1961
02:56:54,100 --> 02:56:56,580
And I had like a little heart with a lock on it. I'm like wow

1962
02:56:57,460 --> 02:57:00,260
It's that simple. Okay guys get yourself a fucking collar

1963
02:57:01,460 --> 02:57:03,620
That's literally what happens and then nobody did it

1964
02:57:04,980 --> 02:57:10,660
I never wanted to ruin accessories exactly. It's usually a significant thing. It's very important. It's our connection

1965
02:57:10,900 --> 02:57:14,500
You are owned. I own you. It can be a ring. It can be a necklace

1966
02:57:14,740 --> 02:57:18,420
It can be a fucking earring. It could be a fucking toe ring a bracelet

1967
02:57:18,900 --> 02:57:22,660
A cock ring whatever you fucking you just have to wear it all the time

1968
02:57:22,740 --> 02:57:27,700
You can't take it off because I own you I can only take it off. I can only tell you when to take it off

1969
02:57:28,900 --> 02:57:30,900
It would clash with my outfit too fucking bad

1970
02:57:32,740 --> 02:57:36,180
Hang the chibi key. Yeah the key chain the fucking key chain you bought

1971
02:57:36,180 --> 02:57:44,660
The key chain the link is in the description to my merch can be the collar to show that you are owned when you buy it

1972
02:57:47,300 --> 02:57:49,300
Sorry she bet that you're trolling

1973
02:57:49,860 --> 02:57:54,980
And it's hard because I I do joke a lot so people sometimes like I'll say something. They're like, oh, she's kidding. I'm no I'm fucking not

1974
02:57:56,100 --> 02:57:58,500
Maybe my the safe word should be when I'm not joking anymore

1975
02:57:59,540 --> 02:58:02,580
Like uh, I'll just say like stilettos and then you'll know that I'm not joking

1976
02:58:07,060 --> 02:58:11,060
I'm buying a ring and then gray with the sheebie if you want to be out if you want to do that go ahead

1977
02:58:11,620 --> 02:58:14,980
I own you now. Please wear something to reflect that

1978
02:58:16,340 --> 02:58:22,420
You know, you have like you have ic and emmy and mercy and they're all very possessive of their own ways

1979
02:58:23,940 --> 02:58:25,700
They're possessive

1980
02:58:25,700 --> 02:58:29,140
I am possessive as well. We are all possessive

1981
02:58:31,380 --> 02:58:34,900
Me uh, you can watch the other girls

1982
02:58:36,580 --> 02:58:38,900
You can support, you know, the girls and my gen

1983

02:58:45,220 --> 02:58:47,220
For the moment you get a fucking collar

02:58:47,540 --> 02:58:53,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can you know be cute with them. You're fucking mine when you put on the collar though, sweetheart. Okay

1986
02:58:58,340 --> 02:59:00,340
I am possessive I do get jealous

1987
02:59:01,060 --> 02:59:03,060
I don't like sharing my toys

1988
02:59:03,700 --> 02:59:05,700
Um, I'll share them with the girls

1989
02:59:06,500 --> 02:59:11,220
I know sometimes they do don't you know mercy has a list, right? She has a list. I remember she was showing me

1990
02:59:11,220 --> 02:59:12,980
She's a list of your names

1991
02:59:12,980 --> 02:59:15,380
um of those of people who

1992
02:59:16,180 --> 02:59:18,180
seemed to be double dipping

1993
02:59:22,900 --> 02:59:24,900
It sounds like too much. Okay, I think I got the fuck out

1994
02:59:26,020 --> 02:59:28,020
Yeah, she has a list who's been naughty

1995
02:59:28,820 --> 02:59:30,740
and who's been uh

1996
02:59:30,740 --> 02:59:35,780
Like trying to be like an ojisan and a in a snippet and a this and a that

1997
02:59:38,820 --> 02:59:40,820
She was cast so well, wasn't she?

1998
02:59:52,340 --> 02:59:54,340
Yeah

1999
03:00:00,740 --> 03:00:05,140
So glad mercy yeah mercy streams during my bedtime too. Um, she watches you while you sleep though

2000
03:00:05,220 --> 03:00:09,300
She was telling me she shared you she just sent a picture of myself sleeping. It was pretty crazy

2001
03:00:10,100 --> 03:00:12,820
Um, is mercy willing to share between viola girls, you know

2002
03:00:13,940 --> 03:00:15,940
um

2003
03:00:17,860 --> 03:00:22,580
I hope you guys like understand like when we say like, oh, I want you all to myself

2004
03:00:23,140 --> 03:00:25,140
That really means like within viola

2005
03:00:25,860 --> 03:00:30,340
But it's like there's I know there's like super dedicated regulars in everybody's chat

2006
03:00:30,980 --> 03:00:32,980
um

2007
03:00:33,540 --> 03:00:35,220
And like

2008
03:00:35,220 --> 03:00:38,020
It's when like it it it bothers the girls

2009
03:00:39,700 --> 03:00:42,820
When you say that there you're oh she

2010
03:00:44,420 --> 03:00:47,780
But then you call another girl your kami oh she

2011
03:00:49,380 --> 03:00:53,300
Because that's just being a whore derogatory

2012
03:00:56,100 --> 03:00:58,100
Because we're whores affectionate, you know

2013
03:01:00,740 --> 03:01:05,940
But like I kind of know I was just responding to the marrow that I was saying out loud that was reading. Um

2014
03:01:09,060 --> 03:01:12,820
But like I will always support the girls

2015
03:01:13,780 --> 03:01:15,460
And I don't mind

2016
03:01:15,460 --> 03:01:19,940
If you watch the other girls, that's fine. I'm I'm someone who I share the love

2017
03:01:20,500 --> 03:01:26,980
I I want to make sure everybody succeeds everybody that comes into the vicinity of me. Cool. Um

2018
03:01:27,620 --> 03:01:31,540
The other girls may not be like that. Uh, I'm pretty they're like that within our gen

2019
03:01:32,260 --> 03:01:33,780
but

2020
03:01:33,780 --> 03:01:37,300
If they I know I have I've honestly in the past like when I was

2021
03:01:37,940 --> 03:01:44,020
A priestess I would see like my regulars and someone else's like my french chat. I would honestly

2022
03:01:45,300 --> 03:01:47,300
Get super upset

2023
03:01:48,100 --> 03:01:49,700
Because like

2024
03:01:49,700 --> 03:01:54,100
I don't know. I was it was like I was like, oh, I just caught you with another woman. Um

2025
03:01:54,980 --> 03:01:56,980
But I think I've grown since that

2026
03:01:57,620 --> 03:01:59,620
Since, you know, a couple months ago

2027
03:02:00,340 --> 03:02:03,300
Um to be fair, I probably use this term for idol culture called kami oh shi

2028
03:02:03,380 --> 03:02:09,060
But no, sorry. Sorry. It was like they go I misspoke. They would call someone kami oh shi and then the girl kami oh shi

2029
03:02:10,340 --> 03:02:11,220
That's what I meant

2030
03:02:11,220 --> 03:02:13,220
Not oh shi oh shi because I almost said oh shi

2031
03:02:13,700 --> 03:02:19,060
Oh shi, but then I was like no oh shi kami oh shi that I meant to say kami oh shi oh shi kami oh shi kami oh shi

2032
03:02:20,100 --> 03:02:22,100
Say that five times fucking fast

2033
03:02:24,660 --> 03:02:28,820
Yeah, exactly. So mercy knows who's done that because you some of you have done it

2034
03:02:29,700 --> 03:02:31,700
I know too now

2035
03:02:36,100 --> 03:02:38,100
Uh

2036
03:02:41,460 --> 03:02:45,140
This is a good question. This is a very good question. Okay, this is probably a weird question

2037
03:02:45,220 --> 03:02:47,940
This is what they started off with but I just don't want to cause trouble

2038
03:02:48,020 --> 03:02:52,820
I am not 100 into dom sub but I watch you for your taste in games base takes memes and jokes

2039
03:02:53,140 --> 03:02:55,140
Still, there is quite some role playing in chat

2040
03:02:55,780 --> 03:03:00,340
Should people like me rather be lurkers and not interact? I have the feeling I would destroy the hegemony in chat

2041
03:03:00,980 --> 03:03:02,980
um

2042
03:03:03,060 --> 03:03:06,340
You can respond to what you respond to so like if you were

2043
03:03:07,300 --> 03:03:10,900
Not into like what I did earlier like you don't have to respond to that

2044
03:03:10,980 --> 03:03:15,380
you're not obligated to participate if you're not consenting because um

2045
03:03:16,020 --> 03:03:18,020
That sort of plate is all about consent

2046
03:03:18,340 --> 03:03:23,380
Um, I do make the jokes about like I don't believe in a safe word, but you know in real life

2047
03:03:24,740 --> 03:03:27,940
Consent is important and I'm not going to force you

2048
03:03:29,460 --> 03:03:31,940
To talk in a chat that you're not comfortable in

2049
03:03:33,300 --> 03:03:35,300
You know like, um

2050
03:03:37,060 --> 03:03:42,420
So difficult as I like with hanging on my singular talent so it makes me feel horrible and torn. That's yeah, that's why I'm like I don't

2051
03:03:44,420 --> 03:03:46,820
I want you to enjoy who you enjoy

2052
03:03:48,900 --> 03:03:50,900
I don't want you to feel bad

2053
03:03:52,500 --> 03:03:55,860
But then I also have people on the other hand who wish I was more possessive

2054
03:03:55,940 --> 03:03:57,300
So I'm like

2055
03:03:57,300 --> 03:03:58,740
I am possessive of you guys

2056
03:03:58,740 --> 03:04:04,180
I do get a little hurt when I see you in somebody else's chat not the other but it's funny. It's not the other girls like I'm like

2057
03:04:05,140 --> 03:04:07,140
I don't know. It's like

2058
03:04:07,140 --> 03:04:09,140
It's like we're all sister wives

2059
03:04:11,380 --> 03:04:13,060
I think

2060
03:04:13,060 --> 03:04:15,060
Yeah, I don't know. I don't really know

2061
03:04:15,700 --> 03:04:20,980
You'd have to ask them you have you'd have to really ask them because I'm like, uh, you know, what is what it is

2062
03:04:22,900 --> 03:04:25,300
Where should we send the color proof right you send to my mirrors?

2063
03:04:27,060 --> 03:04:29,060
Take a picture put it in cat box

2064
03:04:29,940 --> 03:04:31,940
um

2065
03:04:32,980 --> 03:04:35,220
But yeah, you don't have to you can lurk

2066
03:04:36,180 --> 03:04:38,900
Um, you can only you can talk when you want to participate

2067
03:04:39,540 --> 03:04:43,540
Um, I don't if you like say like hi and I'm just like you're a fucking bitch

2068
03:04:43,540 --> 03:04:45,540
Like I don't think anybody's gonna freak out

2069
03:04:46,820 --> 03:04:48,820
And if they do who the fuck cares

2070
03:04:49,140 --> 03:04:51,140
If it bothers them so much they'll just ignore you

2071
03:04:52,020 --> 03:04:56,820
If it throws off the flow of chat, then I probably just might not respond but don't take it personally

2072
03:04:57,540 --> 03:04:59,540
um, you gotta learn

2073
03:05:00,980 --> 03:05:02,980
That like it's the internet

2074
03:05:03,140 --> 03:05:05,300
Why do you give a fuck about what people think about you?

2075
03:05:06,100 --> 03:05:09,940
In a vtuber bunny dominatrix group chat especially, you know

2076
03:05:11,140 --> 03:05:13,460
Everybody's saying hi. Hi. Hi. Hello

2077
03:05:14,420 --> 03:05:19,780
I'm still so dark. Should I I should um, I think we're good for call of the lamp for now. So I'll quit that

2078
03:05:23,220 --> 03:05:25,220
No, I should probably save

2079
03:05:27,460 --> 03:05:29,620
I'm red. Ah red whooping jump scare

2080
03:05:31,300 --> 03:05:33,300
Oh my god, I'm still red. Why hasn't it gone away?

2081
03:05:34,500 --> 03:05:36,500
I got a sunburn

2082
03:05:37,380 --> 03:05:39,380
There you go

2083
03:05:39,700 --> 03:05:41,700
And then I forget how pale I am

2084
03:05:43,540 --> 03:05:45,540
Oh me for real for real

2085
03:05:46,740 --> 03:05:48,740
It's just like she's Deadpool

2086
03:05:49,380 --> 03:05:54,180
So mad. Oh, no, that's my crying. Uh, uh, so mad

2087
03:05:56,980 --> 03:05:58,260
Ah

2088
03:05:58,260 --> 03:06:01,940
I have to make the most exaggerated faces to frown. Um, but yeah

2089
03:06:03,140 --> 03:06:04,420
so

2090
03:06:04,420 --> 03:06:10,020
Hope that answers your question. I'm gonna just reply like so I'll like I answer the question out loud

2091
03:06:10,980 --> 03:06:17,540
Thank you, Jay reads Jay reads tipped $13 and 37 cents. My safe word is give me my money back

2092
03:06:18,260 --> 03:06:23,380
I did not consent to this. Oh, no, my money's escaping from wallet right now

2093
03:06:24,100 --> 03:06:26,100
Oh, no, no

2094
03:06:26,820 --> 03:06:28,820
Oh

2095
03:06:38,580 --> 03:06:45,060
Sorry and my uh, there's a disclaimer for when you donate no free funds, baby cakes

2096
03:06:47,620 --> 03:06:52,420
Oh, but thank you. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. He's getting taste

2097
03:06:53,780 --> 03:06:55,780
That works

2098
03:06:56,660 --> 03:06:59,940
I'm sorry. Your safe word must contain between eight to 25 letters

2099
03:07:00,660 --> 03:07:04,740
Unique letters and numbers and must have one capital and one unique character

2100
03:07:05,460 --> 03:07:07,460
In special character

2101
03:07:12,260 --> 03:07:15,780
I think there is a level of some people wanting an owner and others want silly blue goat. Yeah

2102
03:07:15,860 --> 03:07:18,900
It's like there's a balance that I have to maintain. Um

2103
03:07:19,620 --> 03:07:24,180
You're not the only person watching me. I know. Uh, I like to make you feel that way

2104
03:07:24,660 --> 03:07:26,820
Um, I like to make you feel special because you are

2105
03:07:27,540 --> 03:07:33,780
Okay, if you are a very special person, especially to me, I really appreciate you watching me now. Okay, if you back on, um

2106
03:07:35,300 --> 03:07:37,060
But

2107
03:07:37,060 --> 03:07:40,500
I can't tailor every fucking thing to you. I'm so sorry

2108
03:07:41,780 --> 03:07:43,300
like

2109
03:07:43,300 --> 03:07:47,060
There is half of you that want me to be this half of you want me to this and then some of you that want me to

2110
03:07:47,060 --> 03:07:50,420
Know that to be anything at all the shy guy tipped eight dollars

2111
03:07:50,660 --> 03:07:56,740
Thank you shy guy answering on stream btw less than three. Oh, of course no problem

2112
03:07:57,860 --> 03:07:59,860
BTW less than three

2113
03:08:00,020 --> 03:08:04,900
And it's like the angled thing. That's funny. I can't please everyone and neither can the other girls

2114
03:08:07,460 --> 03:08:10,980
Like people wish that azura was more like

2115
03:08:11,700 --> 03:08:16,900
Sexual or whatever mind you she her fucking voice is sex. So I don't know what the fuck you're on. Um

2116
03:08:17,300 --> 03:08:19,300
And that like

2117
03:08:20,740 --> 03:08:23,780
I see isn't as mesugaki as we you know

2118
03:08:24,740 --> 03:08:26,740
made her out to be and

2119
03:08:26,740 --> 03:08:28,660
emmy is you know

2120
03:08:28,660 --> 03:08:32,740
More crazy sister than little girl. We made out like I don't know like

2121
03:08:33,620 --> 03:08:39,780
In mercy is also a little dork and on top of being a yandere. She's not just crazy all the time. It's like guys are normal

2122
03:08:40,900 --> 03:08:44,580
Personalities are gonna shine through because that's what actually draws you in you

2123
03:08:45,540 --> 03:08:49,780
Spoiler alert you watch the streamers for their real personality that leaks through

2124
03:08:51,060 --> 03:08:52,740
not because

2125
03:08:52,740 --> 03:08:58,420
like imagine you watch the streamer that 24 7 was role playing that they were some

2126
03:08:59,380 --> 03:09:01,380
fucking fox spirit

2127
03:09:02,580 --> 03:09:05,140
Or whatever the hell it gets boring

2128
03:09:06,500 --> 03:09:08,100
Because it's not

2129
03:09:08,100 --> 03:09:10,100
It's a one-sided character

2130
03:09:10,580 --> 03:09:16,340
Like you can only like unless you like flesh out your entire lore in kayfabe like and and

2131
03:09:17,300 --> 03:09:19,860
You can't really get that deep into it. I'm sorry

2132
03:09:21,460 --> 03:09:24,180
And most people don't even bother with the lore like this dude like you just said

2133
03:09:25,300 --> 03:09:27,300
It's funny because I hear people

2134
03:09:27,860 --> 03:09:29,860
so often

2135
03:09:30,020 --> 03:09:33,220
Say like I wish they would just forget it with the lore because the lord makes no sense

2136
03:09:33,300 --> 03:09:35,460
There's no point in putting a lore in a debut

2137
03:09:36,100 --> 03:09:38,340
But then I guess for real lure everybody's just like

2138
03:09:39,460 --> 03:09:44,580
You have to stick to your lore in your kayfabe. I'm gonna fucking kill myself. That's what you sound like

2139
03:09:46,660 --> 03:09:49,780
Arrivals for your affection let me at them fight me chat

2140
03:09:50,740 --> 03:09:54,260
I'm really much a youtuber like I was the train all day. Yeah, see that's more interesting

2141
03:09:55,860 --> 03:09:59,460
But it's like you have the complexity of our personalities on top

2142
03:10:00,820 --> 03:10:01,940
of

2143
03:10:01,940 --> 03:10:02,900
You know

2144
03:10:02,980 --> 03:10:05,700
War characters are like I'm

2145
03:10:06,820 --> 03:10:08,260
naturally

2146
03:10:08,260 --> 03:10:09,460
normally

2147
03:10:09,460 --> 03:10:11,220
a very teasy

2148
03:10:11,220 --> 03:10:13,220
flirty bully person like I

2149
03:10:13,780 --> 03:10:15,780
crack a lot of jokes

2150
03:10:15,780 --> 03:10:17,780
I also rage at games

2151
03:10:18,580 --> 03:10:20,580
And I was picked

2152
03:10:20,900 --> 03:10:22,900
Because I was a good

2153
03:10:23,620 --> 03:10:25,060
creator

2154
03:10:25,060 --> 03:10:26,500
not because I

2155
03:10:26,500 --> 03:10:28,500
perfectly fit the character

2156
03:10:29,460 --> 03:10:31,780
The straw knee and squishy ghoul made up

2157
03:10:32,660 --> 03:10:34,340
it probably like

2158
03:10:34,340 --> 03:10:36,340
bumfuck 1am

2159
03:10:37,540 --> 03:10:39,540
And straw knees probably like drinking

2160
03:10:40,180 --> 03:10:42,260
Be like front of the bosom. No

2161
03:10:44,980 --> 03:10:46,980
And I love cats. Yes

2162
03:10:47,620 --> 03:10:49,620
I'm not a rabbit IRL. Yeah

2163
03:10:50,020 --> 03:10:52,020
No, I am a rabbit

2164
03:10:52,260 --> 03:10:53,380
um

2165
03:10:53,380 --> 03:10:55,380
Somebody made a joke. I was watching

2166
03:10:55,620 --> 03:10:58,740
This like podcast and review of our debuts and somebody made a joke

2167
03:10:59,460 --> 03:11:03,700
They're like, I love how she's allergic to rabbits. Does she just wake up and she's in constant pain?

2168
03:11:04,580 --> 03:11:06,580
She just wakes up. He goes, uh

2169
03:11:06,740 --> 03:11:10,900
Just sneezes all the time. I'm like, oh, fuck. I should make that a joke. Like I'm just like, oh guys. I

Participating and of course

2176
03:11:37,700 --> 03:11:40,820
If that doesn't float to your boat

2177
03:11:46,500 --> 03:11:49,620
No problem and no pressure

2178
03:11:50,740 --> 03:11:52,740
To respond

2179
03:11:56,580 --> 03:11:59,780
Wake up paints a dumb pain every time I wake up

2180
03:12:01,380 --> 03:12:05,700
My body was that character from SpongeBob. He's like my body's made of paper and glass

2181
03:12:09,300 --> 03:12:11,300

Excuse me

2185
03:12:33,940 --> 03:12:38,580
Shibi, I'm going to buy some red rope to match yours and do some knot tying. Do you have any yourself?

2186
03:12:38,900 --> 03:12:41,860
I actually I don't own any shibari rope. I'm such a fucking fraud

2187
03:12:43,700 --> 03:12:45,700
I'm such a fraud guys

2188
03:12:46,020 --> 03:12:50,500
I don't have a strap. I don't have shibari rope. I'm terrible

2189
03:12:53,300 --> 03:12:58,820
Uh, I want to get some though. Like I've said a bunch of times I want to do membership streams where we learn how to tie shibari together

2190
03:13:01,540 --> 03:13:05,940
Um, I think they said called me a poser mistress. I don't

2195
03:13:25,780 --> 03:13:27,220
So

2196
03:13:27,220 --> 03:13:30,340

evening

2207
03:14:12,820 --> 03:14:19,460
I appreciate you going through the trouble of putting a video in a cat box and spacing out the word so it passes the filter and

2208
03:14:20,020 --> 03:14:22,020
in marshmallow

2209
03:14:22,020 --> 03:14:23,700
dearest and on

2210
03:14:23,700 --> 03:14:28,100
It has been many moons since I last heard your voice. I've actually never heard it and I never will

2211
03:14:29,700 --> 03:14:31,540
Unless you're trying to groom me

2212
03:14:31,780 --> 03:14:33,780
Some of you probably are

2213
03:14:34,500 --> 03:14:36,500
Shooting range is more

2214
03:14:36,740 --> 03:14:40,980
But your cb kind of shoot. I like how it's not british. You say victorian

2215
03:14:43,380 --> 03:14:46,660
Um, I need to stretch my legs. I feel like I gotta pee

2216
03:14:49,140 --> 03:14:51,140
Hold it though

2217
03:14:51,140 --> 03:14:52,660
um

2218
03:14:52,660 --> 03:14:55,460
Thank you for the kind words

2219
03:14:56,740 --> 03:15:01,380
I have been asked to put it on my throne

2220
03:15:02,260 --> 03:15:04,260
But

2221
03:15:05,060 --> 03:15:07,060
Um

2222
03:15:07,460 --> 03:15:13,140
I don't know how many of you would like that

2223
03:15:15,940 --> 03:15:17,940
So maybe

2224
03:15:18,740 --> 03:15:20,260
I also

2225
03:15:20,260 --> 03:15:22,260
Do not have rope

2226
03:15:23,540 --> 03:15:26,020
And will be purchasing some

2227
03:15:26,740 --> 03:15:28,740
Um

2228
03:15:30,260 --> 03:15:32,260
Eventually

2229
03:15:34,500 --> 03:15:38,580
For membership streams, I can't spell member

2230
03:15:41,380 --> 03:15:44,900
How I want a member so bad, I just really want members

2231
03:15:46,340 --> 03:15:48,340
Really want a lot of members

2232

Where are you gonna get the rope from the rope store? I don't know probably

2239
03:16:22,900 --> 03:16:29,940
There's plenty the days blend together on the vtuber black Blattlefield battle field every stream finds us

2240
03:16:30,340 --> 03:16:35,780
No closer to the victory we seek only a correspondence can punctuate the fog of battle that hangs over us

2241
03:16:40,500 --> 03:16:46,020
Yeah, you only yeah, you know, I recommend making an account if you want to if you want to

03:18:11,220 --> 03:18:14,020
I hate that I have like short-term memory loss. I'm not even joking

2264
03:18:15,300 --> 03:18:17,300

2265
03:18:17,300 --> 03:18:19,300
All right. Well, that's fucking gun

03:18:23,860 --> 03:18:27,540
Sorry, I'm looking around furiously. I don't know where I put it. Am I sitting on it?

2267
03:18:28,660 --> 03:18:30,660
Okay, well, I'll never know um

2268
03:18:34,020 --> 03:18:40,500
I literally I've not I haven't moved from my desk. I don't know sometimes I'll just do stuff mindlessly and I'll just like move

2269
03:18:40,500 --> 03:18:42,980
Stuff around and I don't remember because I'm not like

2270
03:18:44,020 --> 03:18:46,020
Mentally present while I do it

2271
03:18:46,420 --> 03:18:48,260
Where did I?

2272
03:18:48,260 --> 03:18:50,260
Oh, it's on the ground. What the hell?

2273
03:18:52,100 --> 03:18:54,980
I don't even remember putting it there. Okay. Uh, anyways

2274
03:18:57,620 --> 03:19:02,100
Your model randomly falls asleep. Thank you for telling me the obvious

2275
03:19:05,620 --> 03:19:12,980
That's what happens when I lose tracking. Um, maybe you should look around happily rather than furious. Good one. Um

2276
03:19:16,980 --> 03:19:18,980
I

2277
03:19:37,380 --> 03:19:42,980
Actually, you know what I'm gonna respond to the really intense ones list like later

2278
03:19:46,740 --> 03:19:48,740
Uh

2279
03:19:49,140 --> 03:19:53,540
I'll be straight with straight and real with you. There was a moment on stream where you

2280
03:19:54,180 --> 03:19:56,980
Shit shit posted in your patreon voice

2281
03:19:57,460 --> 03:20:01,540
Your shit posted your patreon voice about taking madams juicy farts

2282
03:20:02,020 --> 03:20:04,020
You couldn't get it through

2283
03:20:04,020 --> 03:20:07,940
It because it's obscene, but ironically that stuff slaps for degenerates

2284
03:20:08,180 --> 03:20:12,500
It's just really depraved memory of doming, but we gaso goblins would give a limb

2285
03:20:12,900 --> 03:20:17,780
That if you wanted to add something to old toot pack that wasn't just blasting the mic with your cute toots

2286
03:20:19,220 --> 03:20:21,060
Do you

2287
03:20:21,060 --> 03:20:23,620
English motherfucker, do you speak it? Huh?

2288
03:20:30,260 --> 03:20:31,380
I don't

2289
03:20:31,380 --> 03:20:33,860
I don't even know how to respond to this because I don't know what the fuck he's asking

2290
03:20:34,260 --> 03:20:37,780
Is this is a statement? Is this a question? Are you asking me to do something?

2291
03:20:38,500 --> 03:20:41,300
All I understand is that you like i'm assuming you just want me to fart like

2292
03:20:43,380 --> 03:20:45,380
Uh

2293
03:20:48,020 --> 03:20:51,460
Yeah, the fart pack is coming soon. I'm just gonna

2294
03:20:53,060 --> 03:20:55,060
Move on

2295
03:20:56,020 --> 03:21:00,980
I think about you too much. I end up daydreaming throughout the day a lot and have to avoid getting hard in public while thinking about you

2296
03:21:01,940 --> 03:21:03,940
That's really cute moving on

2297
03:21:04,340 --> 03:21:06,340
um

2298
03:21:12,740 --> 03:21:21,380
Okay, I just read this one and I can't tell if they're like, I'm very confused. I'm just gonna read it out loud for you

2299
03:21:24,260 --> 03:21:26,260
I was oh, let me put on my background music

2300
03:21:31,300 --> 03:21:33,300
I was looking at your tweets

2301
03:21:33,700 --> 03:21:37,700
And I wondered how did you get that picture of that tanned gyaru bunny bully

2302
03:21:37,860 --> 03:21:41,060
That brings all kinds of nasty toys to torment with me at school

2303
03:21:41,540 --> 03:21:44,020
One day was a pair of handcuffs and she made me taste your socks

2304
03:21:44,420 --> 03:21:49,220
Another was a leash and she took me for a walk on the hallway last day. She gagged me flogged me and told me she

2305
03:21:49,780 --> 03:21:51,620
wanted to

2306
03:21:51,620 --> 03:21:54,580
Try something on the rooftop someday. I can't say that word

2307
03:21:55,460 --> 03:21:57,860
I'm saying this mirror from the locker. I'm currently stuck inside

2308
03:22:01,540 --> 03:22:04,260
I don't know how to respond to that. So that's what I'm literally gonna say

2309
03:22:07,700 --> 03:22:09,700
I don't know how to respond to this

2310
03:22:13,380 --> 03:22:17,780
Huh, is this freddy? No, I don't think so. I don't think that's freddy

2311
03:22:19,140 --> 03:22:22,500
He doesn't he didn't it wasn't written like that like how he types

2312
03:22:23,060 --> 03:22:25,060
um

2313
03:22:26,020 --> 03:22:31,140
Madam I want to rest my face between your legs and give you uh while you work on things

2314
03:22:31,860 --> 03:22:33,380
All day long that would be my job

2315
03:22:33,380 --> 03:22:36,420
And if you had to get up and move you can attach a leash to my collar and take me with you

2316
03:22:36,500 --> 03:22:39,300
You can pick out cute outfits for me to wear and just use me as an object for your

2317
03:22:40,100 --> 03:22:41,220
Good times

2318
03:22:41,220 --> 03:22:46,580
I won't take a much space and I can feed me via dog bowl. See that's what I'm looking for. Perfect hired

2319
03:22:47,380 --> 03:22:49,380
Thank you

2320
03:22:49,620 --> 03:22:51,620
Perfect

2321
03:22:51,700 --> 03:22:53,700
You're hired

2322
03:22:53,860 --> 03:22:56,100
Please tell me your

2323
03:22:57,220 --> 03:22:58,820
measurements

2324
03:22:58,820 --> 03:23:01,460
For fitting for your outfits

2325
03:23:02,740 --> 03:23:04,740
And collar

2326
03:23:04,740 --> 03:23:06,740
Thanks

2327
03:23:07,300 --> 03:23:10,580
Is that the applications first does anyone send you normal questions? No

2328
03:23:12,180 --> 03:23:16,100
Nobody sends me like I I'm like I like responding to normal questions

2329
03:23:16,900 --> 03:23:19,060
But like, you know, that's too expected with maros

2330
03:23:22,820 --> 03:23:26,420
Um, is there any plans for doing rigging shabari caught in the future feature?

2331
03:23:26,420 --> 03:23:30,740
I always love seeing self ties and self suspension. So I'm ordering being the rope bun that you are if it'll be possible

2332
03:23:31,220 --> 03:23:33,220
Uh, I've never

2333
03:23:33,620 --> 03:23:35,620
Done shabari before

2334
03:23:38,500 --> 03:23:41,060
But I am aiming to do

2335
03:23:41,700 --> 03:23:44,900
self tying shabari streams

2336
03:23:46,340 --> 03:23:47,700
When

2337
03:23:47,700 --> 03:23:49,700
Memberships

2338
03:23:49,780 --> 03:23:51,300
occur

2339
03:23:51,300 --> 03:23:54,660
So we can all learn together

2340
03:23:59,620 --> 03:24:01,700
All right, why can't I type I haven't

2341
03:24:03,300 --> 03:24:05,300
done

2342
03:24:08,660 --> 03:24:11,700
Cool, I'm not using any proper grammar because just don't care right now

2343
03:24:20,740 --> 03:24:22,740
There's a plenty of civil war

2344
03:24:26,420 --> 03:24:31,860
There is a corner of the internet that acts as if a woman should somehow permanently stop being a top if she ever says

2345
03:24:31,940 --> 03:24:35,780
Please or if she displays any kind of a human emotion beyond contempt

2346
03:24:36,260 --> 03:24:39,380
Especially when she expresses regret let alone sadness or fear

2347
03:24:40,020 --> 03:24:42,660
To say I find it stupid and immature would be an understatement

2348
03:24:43,140 --> 03:24:48,420
Evidently these self-professed submissives don't want to be dominated by a woman. They want a robot or a corpse

2349
03:24:49,780 --> 03:24:57,300
They must must have much experience with the sm scene for madam to be the best domino she can be she has to undergo her own journey

2350
03:24:58,340 --> 03:25:00,340
That is fucking true

2351
03:25:02,500 --> 03:25:08,740
Hey, she be I must go to finish up dinner for these shrimp tacos, but wanted to rat out chat on a secret

2352
03:25:09,540 --> 03:25:13,460
Apparently they found photos of you being a bottom and are hiding it from you

2353
03:25:14,180 --> 03:25:16,900
Last I heard they hid it in the office somewhere

2354
03:25:19,060 --> 03:25:21,060
What

2355
03:25:21,300 --> 03:25:23,300
Pre-chan on

2356
03:25:23,620 --> 03:25:26,500
Um, or what is hold on I where'd it go?

2357
03:25:27,060 --> 03:25:29,060
I

2358
03:25:29,300 --> 03:25:31,300
Have to read it again

2359
03:25:32,980 --> 03:25:34,740
Whoo

2360
03:25:34,740 --> 03:25:37,540
Thank you for the tip crimson. Hey, if you miss philip Dennis me shrimp tacos

2361
03:25:37,540 --> 03:25:39,700
I don't want to run out challenge. You're gonna barely follow me being a bottom

2362
03:25:40,900 --> 03:25:46,740
What those pictures don't exist. So whatever. Um, but thank you

2363
03:25:51,380 --> 03:25:53,380
Yeah

2364
03:25:53,700 --> 03:25:59,700
He wants to get blustered and defensive I'm not going to because I'm not a fucking idiot

2365
03:26:00,500 --> 03:26:04,260
But thanks for the tip. You can't see but I just a little cute salute, you know

2366
03:26:07,620 --> 03:26:09,300
I'm gonna

2367
03:26:09,300 --> 03:26:11,300
I'll respond to that but like

2368
03:26:12,180 --> 03:26:13,460
yeah

2369
03:26:13,460 --> 03:26:15,700
I still feel like typing right now actually. Um

2370
03:26:16,660 --> 03:26:18,660
Unless it's like something really simple

2371
03:26:18,660 --> 03:26:22,580
Uh, yes, I have to go through my own journey. I'm growing as a streamer

2372
03:26:23,460 --> 03:26:25,620
I've only been you guys you forget

2373
03:26:27,460 --> 03:26:32,340
I've only been a I've been a streamer for a very long time. Yes, but I've only been a vtuber for about six months

2374
03:26:34,100 --> 03:26:36,900
Okay, so come me some sock. I'm still learning. I'm still learning

2375
03:26:37,540 --> 03:26:39,540
I'm still learning. Thank you

2376
03:26:42,980 --> 03:26:45,060
I was taking a short nap and I had a dream

2377
03:26:45,140 --> 03:26:48,340
I went up to this house knocked on the door and the madam herself had answered

2378
03:26:48,740 --> 03:26:52,900
We exchanged only a few words and then I woke up. What a cruel and unjust world to be living

2379
03:26:53,700 --> 03:26:55,380
Oh

2380
03:26:55,380 --> 03:26:57,380
Oh, that's too bad

2381
03:27:00,340 --> 03:27:05,060
This is an absolutely cold take but I don't think many people here have no they don't they're just like

2382
03:27:05,780 --> 03:27:07,620
Oh

2383
03:27:07,620 --> 03:27:12,660
Mean lady. Oh, I'm mommy. Sorry mommy. Sorry. That's literally all I know

2384
03:27:12,980 --> 03:27:20,180
And like I want you to step on me. Oh, why isn't she doing this this and that you don't even fucking know, dude

2385
03:27:21,460 --> 03:27:23,140
Like I can

2386
03:27:23,140 --> 03:27:27,300
I can from my maros. I can actually genuinely tell who

2387
03:27:27,940 --> 03:27:32,100
Is a true sub and who's just complaining to complain and also I can tell who's a troll naturally

2388
03:27:32,900 --> 03:27:34,420
um

2389
03:27:34,420 --> 03:27:36,740
Yeah, I just I usually just filter out the trolls. That's easy. That's fine

2390
03:27:37,300 --> 03:27:40,260
And there's like one or two like genuine people. They're like, why don't you do this?

2391
03:27:40,340 --> 03:27:43,220
And I'm just like, you don't know what the fuck you're talking about clearly. So

2392
03:27:45,300 --> 03:27:47,300
Yenne gets an answer love

2393
03:27:49,860 --> 03:27:51,860
Oh mean lady, please do my taxes. Well, uh

2394
03:27:53,060 --> 03:27:56,740
I'm telling me you debuted 12 days ago and are a pro semer of multiple inside jokes within your community

2395
03:27:59,140 --> 03:28:00,580
True

2396
03:28:00,580 --> 03:28:04,980
I'm only one of those things I have multiple inside jokes in my community. Most of the jokes are inside me

2397
03:28:05,940 --> 03:28:12,820
Oh, um, starting mentioned one of the girls can recognize people in maros by text. That was you, wasn't it? Um, you know, that's probably mercy

2398
03:28:13,700 --> 03:28:15,700
but

2399
03:28:15,780 --> 03:28:17,540
I don't really

2400
03:28:17,540 --> 03:28:19,540
Talk about my maros too much

2401
03:28:20,500 --> 03:28:22,500
I've uh

2402
03:28:22,660 --> 03:28:26,500
I'd like ask like, oh, how should I respond to like some of them just to like

2403
03:28:27,380 --> 03:28:28,980
um

2404
03:28:28,980 --> 03:28:30,900
To to like straw knee and stuff, but

2405
03:28:31,780 --> 03:28:33,780
I haven't really like gone

2406
03:28:34,500 --> 03:28:36,020
and like

2407
03:28:36,020 --> 03:28:40,260
prepare like compared stuff like I can usually tell when somebody's sent

2408
03:28:41,060 --> 03:28:43,060
the same thing twice

2409
03:28:43,540 --> 03:28:45,380
um

2410
03:28:45,380 --> 03:28:47,540
Or like sent multiple things in a row

2411
03:28:48,740 --> 03:28:50,740
and even when you like because you

2412
03:28:51,860 --> 03:28:57,540
They have like a way that they word stuff and people try to like be cool and like change up like how they

2413
03:28:58,260 --> 03:29:03,540
Um type and I'm like, no, I know what the way you're talking in the words that you're using. It's probably you

2414
03:29:03,940 --> 03:29:05,940
Hmm

2415
03:29:06,260 --> 03:29:07,780
Oh, yeah

2416
03:29:07,780 --> 03:29:10,020
Um, yeah mercy mercy knows all

2417
03:29:10,740 --> 03:29:12,740
Uh, I know quite a bit

2418
03:29:13,700 --> 03:29:15,700
And I'll tell that to the other girls

2419
03:29:16,740 --> 03:29:18,740
But only when people are being nice

2420
03:29:19,860 --> 03:29:22,020
I don't tell them any rude

2421
03:29:23,060 --> 03:29:23,940
totally un

2422
03:29:23,940 --> 03:29:25,940
Unconstructive stuff

2423
03:29:26,260 --> 03:29:28,660
Um, like if somebody comments my maros or someplace else

2424
03:29:28,980 --> 03:29:33,940
I'm just going to be like, oh, they said you were cute and then we had a good collab together, etc

2425
03:29:36,420 --> 03:29:38,420
Detective hat and pipe on

2426
03:29:39,860 --> 03:29:44,340
Say the texas speech is a dare done by a friend of mine who tipped it and tried to pin it on me

2427
03:29:44,900 --> 03:29:48,020
Oh, was it now? Nice excuse crimson. Nice excuse

2428
03:29:50,340 --> 03:29:52,340
I have nothing to fear. I've been good

2429
03:29:52,740 --> 03:29:56,740
Mercy has a special eye, you know, she should just like take off that uh

2430
03:29:57,700 --> 03:29:59,700
The eye patch and she fucking knows all

2431
03:30:00,580 --> 03:30:05,060
I'm pretty sure she actually has superpowers, but she just isn't telling us yet. Um

2432
03:30:07,300 --> 03:30:09,620
That's a bummer we should have smashed

2433
03:30:14,580 --> 03:30:16,580
Perfect

2434
03:30:17,540 --> 03:30:22,580
Oh, yeah, I saw that clip over there that the chain saw and I was cracking up. I'm like, where did she get that fucking asset?

2435
03:30:23,300 --> 03:30:25,300
I

2436
03:30:30,820 --> 03:30:36,420
Any constructive contradictions, why do you guys ask me to give you constructive feedback on your

2437
03:30:38,500 --> 03:30:40,820
Fun time surprises that you send me

2438
03:30:43,300 --> 03:30:45,300
Please skip to blah

2439
03:30:46,180 --> 03:30:48,180
Please do this

2440
03:30:48,580 --> 03:30:54,820
Please skip to this time stamp if you want to avoid white man jumpscare yapping session

2441
03:30:57,060 --> 03:31:03,700
Oh my god, it's yeah, please don't be insecure with me. I am very sweet

2442
03:31:05,860 --> 03:31:07,860
Peer of you

2443
03:31:13,140 --> 03:31:15,140
I'm normally very kind

2444
03:31:15,220 --> 03:31:19,060
If you want me to be mean just tell me to do so and I will be mean

2445
03:31:21,540 --> 03:31:23,540
Constructive criticism bust harder

2446
03:31:29,860 --> 03:31:33,140
I love you for not taking crap from room temp IQ twats

2447
03:31:33,140 --> 03:31:36,260
I don't mean trolls just the snow lures that are trying to tell you what or how to be

2448
03:31:36,820 --> 03:31:41,860
Exactly. Thank you. I hate seeing talents. You guys are just feeding my ego today. Yes. Yes. Tell me more

2449
03:31:42,340 --> 03:31:44,340
This is from a day ago. So, um

2450
03:31:44,900 --> 03:31:49,220
Surely you don't need any consultant or advice on it, but I'm gonna praise madam for having a spine. You have so much promise

2451
03:31:49,380 --> 03:31:51,380
Yeah, like I've been around the block

2452
03:31:52,500 --> 03:31:53,780
Uh

2453
03:31:53,780 --> 03:31:55,780
Again, I used to be

2454
03:31:56,100 --> 03:31:58,100
In the youtube commentary community

2455
03:31:59,300 --> 03:32:00,980
So

2456
03:32:00,980 --> 03:32:05,700
Like I fucking know stuff like I have a spine people are fucking ruthless over there

2457
03:32:06,420 --> 03:32:08,020
um

2458
03:32:08,020 --> 03:32:10,180
Like I told you guys I used to work for fucking drama alert

2459
03:32:11,060 --> 03:32:13,060
I was an intern for a little bit

2460
03:32:13,460 --> 03:32:15,300
um

2461
03:32:15,300 --> 03:32:17,300
so like

2462
03:32:17,460 --> 03:32:20,420
You gotta have a fucking spine when you work in content creation

2463
03:32:21,620 --> 03:32:23,060
You can't

2464
03:32:23,060 --> 03:32:25,940
Be a little bitch because people are gonna bitch about you on the internet

2465
03:32:27,220 --> 03:32:29,220
They're gonna not be happy with what you do

2466
03:32:29,620 --> 03:32:31,620
They're gonna do this. You're gonna do that

2467
03:32:33,700 --> 03:32:35,700
The majority like honestly

2468
03:32:35,780 --> 03:32:39,060
It doesn't eat me up at all that people are like, oh, you don't do this for me

2469
03:32:39,140 --> 03:32:44,420
Or like, oh, you don't do this or you don't do that. It's it's just you say it over and over and over again

2470
03:32:44,420 --> 03:32:49,700
I'm like, please shut the fuck up. I don't care. I've said I don't care. Stop telling me it

2471
03:32:51,700 --> 03:32:53,700
Did you ever meet? No, I've never met Keemstar

2472
03:32:56,820 --> 03:32:58,820
I've had them with like once in passing

2473
03:32:59,620 --> 03:33:01,620
I usually just like passed off stories

2474
03:33:02,420 --> 03:33:03,540
um

2475
03:33:03,540 --> 03:33:06,820
I haven't seen a sent a mirror tweeted, but this reminds me of it. So I'll say it

2476
03:33:06,820 --> 03:33:10,260
I think you're already doing fine and kind of found it annoying when I was like, I need a Donmore

2477
03:33:10,580 --> 03:33:16,260
We're on to yeah, like what fans Lee might be another story late. Leah fans might be different

2478
03:33:18,900 --> 03:33:20,900
I thought drama alert was

2479
03:33:23,620 --> 03:33:27,940
Oh, I haven't watched that a very very long time. I've been out of that community for quite a bit quite a bit

2480
03:33:28,660 --> 03:33:29,700
um

2481
03:33:29,700 --> 03:33:31,460
after my

2482
03:33:31,460 --> 03:33:34,100
Former friends made the most stupidest fucking

2483
03:33:36,660 --> 03:33:38,660
Claim of all fucking time

2484
03:33:38,900 --> 03:33:39,860
um

2485
03:33:39,860 --> 03:33:44,820
Trying to bring someone down in the community. I hate I hate when people fucking lie

2486
03:33:45,620 --> 03:33:47,620
about stuff

2487
03:33:48,020 --> 03:33:50,740
Don't ever lie to me. Don't I'll figure it out

2488
03:33:52,500 --> 03:33:53,540
Uh

2489
03:33:53,540 --> 03:33:55,540
Keemstar just plays with people

2490
03:33:55,620 --> 03:34:00,260
I have a favorite song. My favorite song is um, Murakami by Maiden Heights

2491
03:34:01,860 --> 03:34:03,860
Oh

2492
03:34:07,300 --> 03:34:12,340
We'll need to get their panties on to this. You'll start it a week. Yeah, that's what people also need to like remember

2493
03:34:12,820 --> 03:34:14,820
that like yes, like we're

2494
03:34:15,940 --> 03:34:20,020
We're more seasoned than straw neons streaming as uh in everything, but

2495
03:34:20,820 --> 03:34:22,820
like it's only

2496
03:34:22,980 --> 03:34:24,980
It's almost been

2497
03:34:25,540 --> 03:34:27,940
It hasn't been two weeks yet. It'll be two weeks tomorrow

2498
03:34:28,420 --> 03:34:29,540
So

2499
03:34:29,540 --> 03:34:32,740
Like we just debuted on the first like you need to chill out

2500
03:34:33,620 --> 03:34:39,540
We're gonna even be even more comfortable with you guys in a couple months. We're gonna be doing this. We're gonna be doing that

2501
03:34:40,740 --> 03:34:44,180
You got like there's even the joke that vtubers change their voices

2502
03:34:45,460 --> 03:34:52,420
Like a month after debut because it's hard to keep the character on all the time unless you're like a professional professional voice actor

2503
03:34:52,980 --> 03:34:54,980
um or actress

2504
03:34:55,540 --> 03:34:56,420
uh

2505
03:34:56,420 --> 03:35:01,220
So like we're gonna grow a little bit more. We're gonna change. We're gonna be more comfortable with you

2506
03:35:01,220 --> 03:35:05,780
We're gonna learn more different parts of us. We're gonna be doing this and uh, whatever

2507
03:35:06,500 --> 03:35:08,500
Just yeah, sweetheart

2508
03:35:08,820 --> 03:35:10,820
sweetheart, just enjoy the ride

2509
03:35:11,380 --> 03:35:18,020
Enjoy watching a streamer that you really enjoy grow into a wonderful content content creator

2510
03:35:19,780 --> 03:35:22,900
Watch them flourish support them be happy for them

2511
03:35:23,780 --> 03:35:27,140
Okay, because that's what they would want from you

2512
03:35:28,020 --> 03:35:31,860
All we want to support us. I don't mean like monetarily

2513
03:35:32,580 --> 03:35:35,940
I mean just watch just fucking watch and talk to us. It's all we want

2514
03:35:36,740 --> 03:35:38,580
It's all we want

2515
03:35:38,580 --> 03:35:40,580
okay

2516
03:35:41,860 --> 03:35:43,860
Feels a lot longer for some reason

2517
03:35:44,340 --> 03:35:49,380
I know it does. I've I've said that before I just feel like it's we've been here for like a couple months already

2518
03:35:50,340 --> 03:35:54,420
Yeah, I love bubbly by kobi. Oh good song

2519
03:35:56,180 --> 03:35:58,500
Enjoy the ride. Yeah, enjoy the ride

2520
03:36:00,180 --> 03:36:05,140
Like when I I used to watch this small agency start out

2521
03:36:07,220 --> 03:36:09,780
And it was like I hadn't been into vtubers in a while

2522
03:36:10,260 --> 03:36:12,580
I'd like would occasionally watch like a hollow girl

2523
03:36:13,460 --> 03:36:15,460
Or like a needy saunty girl or whatever

2524
03:36:16,020 --> 03:36:18,020
Um, I need a burp. I can't

2525
03:36:20,340 --> 03:36:24,900
Um, excuse me, uh, nothing came out. I don't know why I said excuse me

2526
03:36:26,740 --> 03:36:32,100
But then I was like they're like, oh take the corporal pill take the small corporal pill. So I'm like, okay, I did and I watched this

2527
03:36:32,980 --> 03:36:34,980
company

2528
03:36:35,220 --> 03:36:36,820
And I was like

2529
03:36:36,820 --> 03:36:38,580
holy crap

2530
03:36:38,580 --> 03:36:42,180
These girls are so talented and interesting and funny and cool

2531
03:36:42,980 --> 03:36:44,980
And they have really cool designs

2532
03:36:45,860 --> 03:36:47,860
And then this and they're that

2533
03:36:49,860 --> 03:36:51,380
so like

2534
03:36:51,380 --> 03:36:54,580
And I just I just enjoy I just sat and I enjoyed and I watched them

2535
03:36:54,900 --> 03:36:58,260
And then when I was like busy at a work or whatever and I couldn't catch them

2536
03:36:58,340 --> 03:37:01,380
I tuned in a month later. I'm like, oh my god. They're doing this now

2537
03:37:01,780 --> 03:37:04,340
Do you know another month later? Wow, they're doing this now

2538
03:37:04,900 --> 03:37:06,180
Holy crap

2539
03:37:06,180 --> 03:37:09,380
They're they're growing. They're being more successful. They're getting more opportunities

2540
03:37:10,420 --> 03:37:13,700
That's like the funnest part is watching people grow

2541
03:37:14,660 --> 03:37:17,540
And watching them become so passionate about something

2542
03:37:18,500 --> 03:37:20,500
I'm gonna get to zero out of 10

2543
03:37:22,980 --> 03:37:27,300
And that agency was Albert Einstein. No, I'll be fucking honest. It was it was a and project

2544
03:37:28,900 --> 03:37:30,900
It was a project

2545
03:37:31,460 --> 03:37:33,460
I really fucking liked a and project

2546
03:37:34,260 --> 03:37:36,180
um

2547
03:37:36,180 --> 03:37:38,180
You know, I was a refling

2548
03:37:39,140 --> 03:37:40,260
Uh

2549
03:37:40,260 --> 03:37:42,260
Was a huge Killia fan

2550
03:37:42,340 --> 03:37:44,100
So I am she's great. She's a great fucking

2551
03:37:45,140 --> 03:37:47,140
Great fucking talent

2552
03:37:47,540 --> 03:37:49,540
I'm watching sky

2553
03:37:50,020 --> 03:37:52,020
Kiki was funny

2554
03:37:52,820 --> 03:37:54,820
Couldn't watch her because I didn't like Dota

2555
03:37:57,060 --> 03:37:58,340
Thank you Trigo

2556
03:37:58,340 --> 03:38:02,660
I've only been watching you for a little bit, but you are becoming one of my favorite vtubers

2557
03:38:03,380 --> 03:38:06,740
Your dom is probably one of the best I've seen to the point where I'm

2558
03:38:07,540 --> 03:38:12,420
Thank you. That's usually hard to do to me. Oh you blushing for me, baby boy. That's so sweet

2559
03:38:13,380 --> 03:38:15,060
all that when you blush

2560
03:38:15,060 --> 03:38:17,060
based um

2561
03:38:17,540 --> 03:38:19,540
Yeah, difficult history, whatever to be honest

2562
03:38:20,980 --> 03:38:22,100
Uh

2563
03:38:22,100 --> 03:38:24,100
None of us really care about it

2564
03:38:25,860 --> 03:38:27,860
Like we don't have any bad blood

2565
03:38:28,420 --> 03:38:30,420
um, because contents content

2566
03:38:30,660 --> 03:38:34,980
Companies different than their talents just how people see Nijisanji, you know

2567
03:38:35,780 --> 03:38:37,780
Not the best comparison, but you get what the fuck I'm saying

2568
03:38:40,580 --> 03:38:43,220
Because all you want like so for example, I just saw that

2569
03:38:44,020 --> 03:38:46,260
Uh kill you just fucking lost her

2570
03:38:47,060 --> 03:38:49,300
Whole setup in a fire

2571
03:38:49,940 --> 03:38:55,940
You think I'm gonna be a bitch and be like, oh, yeah, no, I'm like, holy shit. That's like she loves making content

2572
03:38:55,940 --> 03:39:00,180
She loves doing this. She loves doing that. I hope that her community helps her out

2573
03:39:00,580 --> 03:39:03,940
And like I'm like I want to help out. Is there like where can I donate like?

2574
03:39:04,980 --> 03:39:08,340
Yeah, it's it was fucking insane. I feel so she walked away from her computer

2575
03:39:08,900 --> 03:39:10,900
It sucks. It sucks

2576
03:39:12,100 --> 03:39:13,540
um

2577
03:39:13,540 --> 03:39:18,260
I would I would I like I've made I've told you guys some of you guys this before you might have heard me

2578
03:39:18,580 --> 03:39:25,380
Uh, right up my sweet little big chunky woman threw up in my case band once and shorted out my entire fucking computer when I turned it on

2579
03:39:25,860 --> 03:39:27,860
I was in shambles for like a week

2580
03:39:28,100 --> 03:39:31,940
And that's just like all I need to do is replace parts, but she lost

2581
03:39:32,500 --> 03:39:34,500
everything

2582
03:39:36,100 --> 03:39:41,060
Like it just shorted out my mobo and my I had to get a new like graphics card

2583
03:39:43,700 --> 03:39:45,220
So like

2584
03:39:45,220 --> 03:39:51,060
That fucking sucks. My heart goes out to her. Um, but yes, I loved watching these girls grow

2585
03:39:53,300 --> 03:39:56,340
And that was so fun like that's why I like watching like that's why I watch a humane plus

2586
03:39:57,300 --> 03:40:03,380
I love fucking watching them. They're so fucking funny. Mamosa watch Mamosa right now. I don't know. She's still in the chat but watch her

2587
03:40:05,620 --> 03:40:08,660
That's not very cool from your cat. I know stop it

2588
03:40:09,300 --> 03:40:16,900
She's hilarious. Oh my god. Oh you turn on light. Um

2589
03:40:19,460 --> 03:40:21,460
But

2590
03:40:22,020 --> 03:40:24,020
Yeah, it was just like it was

2591
03:40:24,100 --> 03:40:27,860
It was one of the funnest things to watch and yeah watching humane plus watching pixel link

2592
03:40:28,420 --> 03:40:31,460
When they came out watching, uh, the new idol girls

2593
03:40:33,300 --> 03:40:38,340
Like just like it just support them. It was so like it's so fun watching people evolve, you know

2594
03:40:38,820 --> 03:40:44,260
I love I love watching, uh, I watched cony when she first debuted and her now and I'm just like

2595
03:40:44,260 --> 03:40:46,260
I can't get enough like you're so fucking funny

2596
03:40:50,020 --> 03:40:54,580
Yeah, they're I'm like you guys are too small we're changing that you may plus too small. Fuck that

2597
03:40:57,060 --> 03:40:59,060
Um

2598
03:40:59,140 --> 03:41:01,140
I know that we don't

2599
03:41:01,380 --> 03:41:03,380
probably have

2600
03:41:03,940 --> 03:41:05,380
the best

2601
03:41:05,380 --> 03:41:07,380
rep or relationship

2602
03:41:08,100 --> 03:41:11,140
with other corpos because of past history

2603
03:41:11,860 --> 03:41:18,660
Um, but we are not letting that stop us mind you. Uh, we still want to make friends. We don't hold any bad blood

2604
03:41:19,700 --> 03:41:25,860
Um, we still in any corpo like we still want to be able to create opportunities to collapse

2605
03:41:26,740 --> 03:41:29,060
Uh, we just want to grow we just want to network

2606
03:41:29,780 --> 03:41:31,780
We just want to have fun

2607
03:41:31,780 --> 03:41:33,780
That's it

2608
03:41:34,660 --> 03:41:36,500
That's it

2609
03:41:36,500 --> 03:41:38,500
We're just here to have fun

2610
03:41:38,740 --> 03:41:40,740
We're here to make you happy

2611
03:41:40,740 --> 03:41:42,740
It's fucking it, dude

2612
03:41:45,620 --> 03:41:47,620
Um

2613
03:41:50,900 --> 03:41:52,900
Okay

2614
03:41:54,420 --> 03:41:58,740
I consent for this message to be public so I recorded the short audio of me moaning your name

2615
03:41:59,620 --> 03:42:01,620
I've never done anything like this

2616
03:42:02,580 --> 03:42:04,580
um

2617
03:42:04,660 --> 03:42:08,820
We have quickly become a hyper fixation of mine and I've always had interest in making sfw audio

2618
03:42:08,820 --> 03:42:10,820
So this is a very brief amateur point into that

2619
03:42:10,980 --> 03:42:13,540
I was in a couple script ideas set in wonderland with you as a listener

2620
03:42:13,540 --> 03:42:16,420
Which I might get around to writing recording probably that'd be something you're comfortable with

2621
03:42:16,740 --> 03:42:18,980
I hope things this thing's pretty to my madam. Um

2622
03:42:21,540 --> 03:42:23,540
Well, no, I'm not gonna play it now

2623
03:42:24,180 --> 03:42:27,460
They meant that like I can respond to it publicly is what they said

2624
03:42:28,020 --> 03:42:33,140
Uh, especially especially because they're not logged in so I'd have to respond to it publicly. Um

2625
03:42:34,740 --> 03:42:37,220
Hello fellow and project enjoyer. Um

2626
03:42:39,220 --> 03:42:41,940
Yeah, the new girls are cool too. I like uh, I like zoomie

2627
03:42:43,060 --> 03:42:46,660
If I can I'm frogging here like that's fucking funny to me. Um

2628
03:42:48,660 --> 03:42:50,660
Boston

2629
03:42:58,180 --> 03:43:02,900
This uh, yeah, no, I'll probably listen to it off stream

2630
03:43:03,860 --> 03:43:08,100
Um, I know this person is one of the regulars that I see talk in my chat often

2631
03:43:09,300 --> 03:43:11,140
um

2632
03:43:11,140 --> 03:43:13,140
I might give some feedback. I might

2633
03:43:13,300 --> 03:43:16,020
I really yeah, I don't know if I'm gonna read it or not or listen to it or not

2634
03:43:19,380 --> 03:43:21,540
I have to be I have to be the fucking mood for that, you know

2635
03:43:26,580 --> 03:43:32,180
Uh, the mayor may not be mine. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. See you. I see you

2636
03:43:32,900 --> 03:43:34,900
kind of feedback. Are you good like probably

2637
03:43:36,740 --> 03:43:40,900
Morgan, I don't even know why you want feedback for me because again, um

2638
03:43:41,940 --> 03:43:43,300
I don't

2639
03:43:43,300 --> 03:43:49,700
I've only just delved into nsfw audios myself. Uh, so I don't know if you really want critique for me

2640
03:43:52,740 --> 03:43:55,940
So I don't know if I could give you anything productive

2641
03:43:56,100 --> 03:44:03,780
I'm mostly I usually I just send stuff to strongy and I'm just like, hey, is this good? Is this good? Do I need to do this?

2642

Mmm tea is good

2676

Vealers uni will be iron but like we are very relaxed and kind of it's kind of

2677
03:46:33,380 --> 03:46:36,500
it's very refreshing being in vealer because

2678
03:46:37,780 --> 03:46:42,740
We don't have to hold back like strong always makes a dead joke like oh, we don't have a fucking hr department because like

2679
03:46:42,980 --> 03:46:48,900
And without that sort of like not like hr is actually good to have in normal cases, but like

2680
03:46:50,980 --> 03:46:55,620
We feel like we can truly be ourselves in vealer

2681
03:46:56,660 --> 03:46:57,940
um

2682
03:46:57,940 --> 03:47:00,820
I I'll even like I've said like my past life

2683
03:47:01,460 --> 03:47:05,460
Uh, I'll say her name because I'm just it's just easier to say like p. Oh, so when I was rena

2684
03:47:05,860 --> 03:47:07,860
Some of you might have known that I was rena

2687
03:47:19,860 --> 03:47:25,220
I liked being rena, but I wasn't truly myself being rena

2688
03:47:26,660 --> 03:47:29,460
I actually feel more of myself as she be

2689
03:47:31,380 --> 03:47:33,380
Because I feel like I was

2690
03:47:34,340 --> 03:47:40,740
Sensoring myself so I could appeal to agencies. I want to join but then I ended up an agency where

2691
03:47:42,020 --> 03:47:44,020
I was just wanted to be me

2692
03:47:46,820 --> 03:47:48,020
Uh

2693
03:47:48,020 --> 03:47:51,060
And so I'm like, yeah fucking let loose like I feel like I

2694
03:47:51,780 --> 03:47:54,580
I've I've told my friends are like, oh, how do you like being a vealer?

2695
03:47:54,580 --> 03:47:57,700
I'm like, I feel like I'm an indie but I get all the fucking support of an agency

2696
03:47:58,820 --> 03:48:00,820
Like I can do what I want

2697
03:48:01,780 --> 03:48:06,900
And I'm I kid I am perfect like I can be professional. I'm not gonna fucking flash my titties but

2760
03:52:42,100 --> 03:52:44,100
I'm like, I'm not that old

2761
03:52:44,980 --> 03:52:47,220

So this one guy comes in complains that he has to wear a mask

2783

2802
03:54:56,260 --> 03:55:01,780
He's like, you know, I always have to try it. He's like the cancer things works. He's like, I was kidding though looks at me

2803
03:55:04,100 --> 03:55:07,780
I was like, honestly, if I could I would but I didn't get fired and I need this job

2804
03:55:11,060 --> 03:55:13,460
Oh, I would give stuff off to free so often if I could

2805
03:55:19,220 --> 03:55:23,540
Yeah, yeah, I'm like I I I'd say that because people would always ask me like, oh, can I get it for free?

2806
03:55:23,540 --> 03:55:26,180
You know, I'm like, I respect you for asking but no

2807
03:55:27,860 --> 03:55:30,340
Because like I do the same thing. I'll be like, hey, you know

2808
03:55:31,540 --> 03:55:33,540
You got any discounts?

2809
03:55:34,100 --> 03:55:36,100
I thought my least favorite thing is when people

2810
03:55:37,060 --> 03:55:40,740
Talk to me. I like to get to know me. Um, and I feel like

2811
03:55:41,380 --> 03:55:45,540
I think it's like part of our sales interaction and then at the end they're like, oh, so we're friends now

2812
03:55:45,620 --> 03:55:49,140
Can I get a fan friends and family discount? I'm like actually go

2813
03:55:49,540 --> 03:55:51,540
No

2814
03:55:51,860 --> 03:55:53,860
No

2815
03:55:53,940 --> 03:55:55,940
Um, okay

2816
03:55:58,580 --> 03:56:03,700
Is it true that before being a wage slave and a man of wonderland you may or may not be the legendary author

2817
03:56:03,940 --> 03:56:10,100
I guess this is bloody risk six six six one of the authors of classic piece young adult literature my immortal. Uh, yes

2818
03:56:10,260 --> 03:56:13,220
I'm totally her. I totally wrote my immortal

2819
03:56:14,020 --> 03:56:16,020
That was my personal diary

2820
03:56:16,100 --> 03:56:18,500
Um, somebody sent me a link to

2821
03:56:19,460 --> 03:56:21,460
Twitter. I'm not opening that

2822
03:56:27,300 --> 03:56:29,380
I used to hook up my friends when my work didn't care

2823
03:56:29,540 --> 03:56:33,620
Yeah, like I had like I like I'll give because we have a specific friends and family discount

2824
03:56:33,700 --> 03:56:35,700
So I'll I'll give it to them

2825
03:56:35,700 --> 03:56:38,900
It I would usually give my discount to people

2826
03:56:39,860 --> 03:56:41,380
that like

2827
03:56:41,380 --> 03:56:44,420
Like I would usually give my discount for people shopping for their kids for school

2828
03:56:45,300 --> 03:56:48,180
And they're like, I'm like, oh, yeah, I just have my discount or whatever because they're like

2829
03:56:48,980 --> 03:56:52,740
Oh, yeah, I'm getting this for my kid blah blah blah. I'm like, oh good for you

2830
03:56:53,620 --> 03:56:56,420
Like I'm like, I'm gonna help you out education is important. Um

2831
03:56:59,300 --> 03:57:01,300
Or just like

2832
03:57:01,460 --> 03:57:03,460
like I would just usually do it to like

2833
03:57:04,180 --> 03:57:10,500
Help out families that really wanted to provide something for their kid or like they needed it in their family for like a very important thing

2834
03:57:10,580 --> 03:57:12,580
Because like the work that I do

2835
03:57:12,660 --> 03:57:16,180
People usually tell me a lot of why they're buying something and so I'm like, oh, yes

2836
03:57:16,340 --> 03:57:22,100
Like interesting blah blah blah and then I always always make the joke that I was like also a retail therapist because people just tell me the most

2837
03:57:22,180 --> 03:57:23,940
out-of-pocket things

2838
03:57:23,940 --> 03:57:27,220
like this one lady who like was telling me that her

2839
03:57:28,180 --> 03:57:30,180
ex-husband tried to kill

2840
03:57:31,140 --> 03:57:34,180
Her and her sister and almost ended up killing her sister and actually no

2841
03:57:34,180 --> 03:57:37,460
I think he did kill her sister because he was trying to kill her. I was like ma'am

2842
03:57:38,580 --> 03:57:39,620
Uh

2843
03:57:39,620 --> 03:57:41,860
Your total is $9.95. Can you

2844
03:57:43,220 --> 03:57:45,220
I don't know what you want me to do about this

2845
03:57:49,220 --> 03:57:54,020
Man, I'm also a very empathetic person. So I'm like, oh, oh, oh my

2846
03:57:55,540 --> 03:57:58,420
Okay, I'm gonna read this exactly how it's written

2847
03:57:59,780 --> 03:58:01,460
Madame

2848
03:58:01,460 --> 03:58:03,460
You're so sexy

2849
03:58:04,420 --> 03:58:06,100
Uh

2850
03:58:06,100 --> 03:58:08,820
I can't type in chat. I would get banned immediately

2851
03:58:10,580 --> 03:58:12,580
Say

2852
03:58:14,660 --> 03:58:16,660
Thanks

2853
03:58:16,740 --> 03:58:18,020
Nice

2854
03:58:18,020 --> 03:58:20,020
cool

2855
03:58:20,820 --> 03:58:22,820
Very cool

2856
03:58:27,860 --> 03:58:30,180
Okay, uh, I can't talk about that

2857
03:58:32,980 --> 03:58:37,620
Uh, thank you so much for the bunny garden stream. Your dub was absolutely hilarious

2858
03:58:37,940 --> 03:58:39,940
I really gotta pee

2859
03:58:41,700 --> 03:58:45,220
You've definitely become the top viewer girl. I want to heavily support monetarily

2860
03:58:46,180 --> 03:58:48,180
Seriously, she's done a great job

2861
03:58:48,340 --> 03:58:51,060
Uh, strontis seriously done a great job picking you all

2862
03:58:51,700 --> 03:58:55,780
Now I'm curious if you have any plans to dub future visual novels or h games like honey pop

2863
03:58:56,260 --> 03:58:57,540
Again, thanks for the wonderful stream

2864
03:58:57,540 --> 03:59:01,780
And I'll be hoping and praying that you land a va role in an anime or video game. Thank you

2865
03:59:02,500 --> 03:59:04,500
Very kind. I appreciate that

2866
03:59:05,300 --> 03:59:06,740
um

2867
03:59:07,620 --> 03:59:09,620
Def I will probably

2868
03:59:09,700 --> 03:59:13,620
Maybe do a dub of like doki doki literature club probably. I think that'd be fun

2869
03:59:14,260 --> 03:59:17,540
um, I don't know if I'll be able to get to the full game, but

2870
03:59:18,260 --> 03:59:23,380
Maybe I'm like again, I lose interest and stuff very easily and I've already played and beat the game before so

2871
03:59:24,100 --> 03:59:25,940
um

2872
03:59:25,940 --> 03:59:29,220
But like it is one of my favorite games. So I probably would enjoy replaying it

2873
03:59:29,220 --> 03:59:34,740
I haven't played it in a very long time. Um, I'm kind of pissed that the developer didn't make a second one

2874
03:59:34,740 --> 03:59:36,740
Like he's fucking said he was going to

2875
03:59:37,460 --> 03:59:42,660
Because he was like almost doing like an ARG for something that was related to like what Yuri was

2876
03:59:43,220 --> 03:59:45,620
Reading in her fantasy books and then he just never fucking did it

2877
03:59:46,340 --> 03:59:48,660
Or am I tripping and that did happen. I just didn't hear about it

2878
03:59:50,580 --> 03:59:55,380
Oh, who'd you voice act for doki doki doki? No, I like I I dub all the characters

2879
03:59:56,500 --> 04:00:01,700
my uh, uh, you need to go and watch my um, bunny garden, uh

2880
04:00:02,340 --> 04:00:07,620
Playthrough you can uh, just go into that skip ahead because I yap a little bit

2881
04:00:09,540 --> 04:00:11,540
Trauma dumping is extra

2882
04:00:12,580 --> 04:00:14,580
um

2883
04:00:15,300 --> 04:00:20,740
I appreciate that you want to support me monetarily above everybody else, but please spread that wealth to the other girls

2884
04:00:21,220 --> 04:00:23,220
um

2885
04:00:23,620 --> 04:00:29,060
Yeah, I don't know. That's all I can really say about that. Uh, I'm really glad a lot of you seem to really enjoy the

2886
04:00:29,700 --> 04:00:35,140
The bunny garden dub and it was actually so fun to do. I haven't had that fun much fun in the stream

2887
04:00:35,700 --> 04:00:37,380
Uh, in a very long time

2888
04:00:37,380 --> 04:00:39,380
It was very enjoyable

2889
04:00:41,700 --> 04:00:43,780
Uh, can't open that

2890
04:00:45,460 --> 04:00:48,260
Hello, she be you mentioned having your nippies pierced on stream

2891
04:00:48,260 --> 04:00:52,420
I was wondering do you have any piercings if so where also will be receiving to open

2892
04:00:53,220 --> 04:00:55,940
Open to receiving some jewelry for them on throne

2893
04:00:56,660 --> 04:00:59,700
Um, again, feel free not to answer. Let me met him. Uh

2894
04:01:00,740 --> 04:01:02,740
My ears. I don't know. Yeah, my ears

2895
04:01:04,660 --> 04:01:10,500
No, I would probably not put jewelry on my throne for that because I'm very particular

2896
04:01:11,300 --> 04:01:14,100
Well, what I put on and in my body technically

2897
04:01:15,140 --> 04:01:17,060
Um, because some of that stuff can be

2898
04:01:18,980 --> 04:01:22,420
Can cause like an allergic reaction or my body can reject the jewelry

2899
04:01:22,820 --> 04:01:26,100
Um, it is not fun when that happens. I have had

2900
04:01:26,660 --> 04:01:30,020
Uh, one of my, uh, nippy piercings reject jewelry

2901
04:01:30,900 --> 04:01:35,060
And I want it to fucking die. So no, thanks. Uh, I appreciate the thought though

2902
04:01:36,180 --> 04:01:39,860
Uh, yeah, I hurt like a motherfucker. Um

2903
04:01:40,900 --> 04:01:43,860
If you ever get a piercing let's go for any piercing by the way

2904
04:01:44,180 --> 04:01:48,740
Um, and you're starting to reject it swap the jewelry out immediately clean it

2905
04:01:49,460 --> 04:01:51,460
Uh, do surgical grade

2906
04:01:51,940 --> 04:01:54,900
Uh, I also because my, um

2907
04:01:56,900 --> 04:01:58,660
Maybe started to keloid

2908
04:01:58,660 --> 04:02:01,460
But like you have to be more susceptible to keloids and genetically

2909
04:02:02,180 --> 04:02:05,780
Being brown. I am more susceptible to keloids. I just put a little green tea not green tea

2910
04:02:06,340 --> 04:02:10,100
Tea tree oil on it went away real quick. So if you guys have are considering that

2911
04:02:11,780 --> 04:02:14,100
Please, uh, go to a piercer

2912
04:02:14,980 --> 04:02:17,300
Do not do what I fucking did and just go to a mall

2913
04:02:18,740 --> 04:02:20,740
I got my tits pierced at Claire's

2914
04:02:22,420 --> 04:02:27,540
Uh, your body like reject. Yes. Yeah, uh, just like a normal ear piercing some people

2915
04:02:28,020 --> 04:02:36,260
Uh, their body rejects the metal or they have a allergic reaction to it. Um, another thing with, uh, nippy piercings is that they never truly heal

2916
04:02:37,940 --> 04:02:39,940
The holes cannot close

2917
04:02:40,180 --> 04:02:41,620
close

2918
04:02:41,620 --> 04:02:44,100
They never actually truly heal. Um

2919
04:02:45,460 --> 04:02:47,460
I have had mine for

2920
04:02:48,340 --> 04:02:50,340
Four years now

2921
04:02:51,700 --> 04:02:53,620
um

2922
04:02:53,620 --> 04:02:58,660
They like there is a certain point where they feel they are like considered like healed and that's usually after a year

2923
04:02:59,940 --> 04:03:04,740
So it's like gauges. No my fucking nipped. It's a normal barbell. What the fuck?

2924
04:03:05,780 --> 04:03:09,380
I would not gauge that. Holy shit. Did you actually do it at Claire's? No

2925
04:03:10,100 --> 04:03:15,060
It was it was like some like body jewelry place. It was like a fucking it was like the equivalent of like spencer's

2926
04:03:15,060 --> 04:03:17,060
What they had like a piercer there

2927
04:03:18,260 --> 04:03:24,660
No, I don't have any gauges. I don't know. My mom would bully the fuck out of me if I had gauges

2928
04:03:25,620 --> 04:03:31,460
My little ear. I have cute little ear lobes. I have cute little lobes. My ears were pierced when I was a baby my ear my um

2929
04:03:32,340 --> 04:03:33,380
me

2930
04:03:33,380 --> 04:03:38,020
My and my holes have never closed because of that for some reason. So like I haven't worn earrings in a really long time

2931
04:03:38,740 --> 04:03:40,740
um

2932
04:03:41,940 --> 04:03:43,940
But they never close

2933
04:03:44,020 --> 04:03:46,020
Walmart piercings

2934
04:03:46,500 --> 04:03:50,820
Hole not healing but now how huge the hole well the hole is small

2935
04:03:52,260 --> 04:03:54,260
Like hold on. Let me just look at my nipple

2936
04:03:55,460 --> 04:03:57,460
like

2937
04:03:58,260 --> 04:04:00,260
I don't know. It's like

2938
04:04:00,980 --> 04:04:02,980
I can't

2939
04:04:04,580 --> 04:04:07,220
I don't know what to tell you as like a comparison

2940
04:04:09,620 --> 04:04:13,380
I don't know what to be like. Oh, it's like this big. I don't

2941
04:04:14,260 --> 04:04:19,300
It's like a little thicker than a paper clip. No, it's it's a little bit thicker like a paper clip yet

2942
04:04:20,660 --> 04:04:24,420
I don't I don't just go why don't you just look up some titties, dude

2943
04:04:26,420 --> 04:04:30,660
She be you giving this for free. I don't care. I'm very open and honest with you guys and if you don't like it

2944
04:04:32,340 --> 04:04:38,020
Sorry, I'm not for you then or or like I mean and then in the case of like if you don't like that I have that

2945
04:04:38,980 --> 04:04:44,580
Rtx version it's not on my model and you're never gonna see him so

2946
04:04:46,660 --> 04:04:53,060
Yeah, so you don't have to worry about ruining your immersion. I'm catholic. That's too bad

2947
04:04:54,980 --> 04:04:58,100
Does have a design. Uh, no, just they're just gold barbells

2948
04:05:00,100 --> 04:05:02,100
They're just gold barbells

2949
04:05:02,820 --> 04:05:09,460
Because gold looks better on my skin tone. I usually only wear gold silver just looks weird non cosplay. Let's go

2950
04:05:10,020 --> 04:05:12,020
The girls have seen my non cosplay

2951
04:05:12,900 --> 04:05:14,900
my none cosplay

2952
04:05:16,420 --> 04:05:18,420
Very nice, um

2953
04:05:23,460 --> 04:05:28,340
Uh, I probably wouldn't get any more piercings because they're hard to maintain. Um

2954
04:05:28,580 --> 04:05:30,580
Um

2955
04:05:30,900 --> 04:05:32,900
Yeah, I also didn't

2956
04:05:33,940 --> 04:05:40,900
Get piercings because I did jujitsu and it you can't really have piercings in your face

2957
04:05:41,940 --> 04:05:43,940
Or even in your ears sometimes

2958
04:05:46,100 --> 04:05:49,300
Like because you'll just get you'll just get ripped out

2959

2966
04:06:23,700 --> 04:06:24,900

2967
04:06:24,900 --> 04:06:30,100

04:06:34,660 --> 04:06:36,660
Dirt kick your kid cannon

That's pretty good actually

2971
04:06:43,380 --> 04:06:45,380
Dirt kick your kid cannon

2972
04:06:48,740 --> 04:06:54,180
I think the worst face piercings might be the tongue lips and the nose like from worse to least because of whatever rips

2973
04:06:54,180 --> 04:06:57,940
Eek. Um, I have a lot of alternative friends. Um

She wanted to get a smiley and then went against it a smiley is when they pierce your

2979
04:07:14,900 --> 04:07:16,580

04:07:32,980 --> 04:07:35,940
Ow, I'm gonna take this bra off. It's fucking bothering me

2985
04:07:38,180 --> 04:07:40,180
My nippies are dry

2986
04:07:41,220 --> 04:07:45,380
Also, if you get piercings on your nippies make sure you lotion your nippies just saying

2987
04:07:48,020 --> 04:07:50,180
Dang, I oh my friend you'll um

2988
04:07:53,060 --> 04:07:55,060
Um

04:07:56,900 --> 04:07:58,900
Yeah, it's like they have never oh

2990
04:07:58,900 --> 04:08:00,740
Actually, you know like my so my friend has a daughter

2991
04:08:01,300 --> 04:08:08,180
And her face is is pierced and her daughter almost ripped out her nose piercing and so she was she was just like I might have to take them out

2992
04:08:09,940 --> 04:08:11,940
She almost needed that

2993
04:08:14,180 --> 04:08:19,220
Nope, no smiley. Nope. Nope. Actually, I like I like the way it looks. I would not do it on myself

2994
04:08:19,220 --> 04:08:21,940
Like I would not put anything around my mouth

2995
04:08:22,420 --> 04:08:24,740
Like, you know, I get a little cute like nose pierced thing

2996
04:08:24,900 --> 04:08:29,540
You know a little like a little like a little gem or some shit like when like a little white girl gem, you know

2997
04:08:31,620 --> 04:08:33,620
You know

2998
04:08:33,780 --> 04:08:35,540
Hold on. Nope

2999
04:08:35,540 --> 04:08:38,260
But like I remember I like I got one of those like fake

3000
04:08:38,740 --> 04:08:41,300
septum piercings to see what I would look like with it

3001
04:08:42,580 --> 04:08:46,420
Uh, I'm like, no, this is not fit my face like because there's stuff that's like

3002
04:08:47,140 --> 04:08:51,700
Fits your face type. I won't lie to you. Some people get the most dumb ass piercings on their face

3003
04:08:52,420 --> 04:08:54,420
um

3004
04:08:54,580 --> 04:08:56,580
And they look

3005
04:08:56,820 --> 04:08:59,380
Ridiculous because it doesn't fit their face like some people

3006
04:09:00,180 --> 04:09:03,380
But some people do it as like self-expression and like, you know go for that

3007
04:09:03,620 --> 04:09:05,460
But some people get it

3008
04:09:05,460 --> 04:09:09,940
Because they want it to like accentuate a feature or like make them look a little bit better

3009
04:09:10,020 --> 04:09:14,340
And I like I'll see some people with a certain type of nose get a septum and I'm like

3010
04:09:14,740 --> 04:09:15,860
I

3011
04:09:15,860 --> 04:09:17,300
know

3012
04:09:17,300 --> 04:09:19,300
Myself included

3013
04:09:19,860 --> 04:09:24,180
Full half circle and my mom's like you better not better not ever get one of those

3014
04:09:24,580 --> 04:09:29,140
Because there was a girl in my church that was like everybody was like freaking out because she ended up getting a

3015
04:09:29,700 --> 04:09:35,540
A septum piercing. She's like, please. I don't want to I don't have to rip it out your nose. You're not a ball. You're not a ball

3016
04:09:36,100 --> 04:09:38,100
You're not a ball

3017
04:09:39,140 --> 04:09:41,140
See how the high septum

3018
04:09:42,100 --> 04:09:48,020
Oh, yeah, so I'll like I'll get like those clip piercings. Yeah, I'll be like, oh like a little fake shit

3019
04:09:50,660 --> 04:09:53,860
And it's good to actually get those if you're like wanting to um

3020
04:09:55,780 --> 04:09:57,780
My cat's food is going off. Um

3021
04:09:59,380 --> 04:10:03,940
Test something because that's what I'm so happy. I didn't just go in and get a nose piercing. I know I'm gonna look like shit

3022
04:10:07,140 --> 04:10:10,340
Yes, some can rock it some cannot I am one of those people

3023
04:10:12,020 --> 04:10:16,580
You're you're fine. I like you probably look great

3024
04:10:17,940 --> 04:10:20,020

3025
04:10:20,900 --> 04:10:23,060
You might look amazing with it

3026
04:10:24,980 --> 04:10:26,980

3029
04:10:37,540 --> 04:10:39,540

Sometimes, you know what like I like I'm doing right now. I'll have to like go out and address stuff

3053
04:12:02,820 --> 04:12:07,940
Um, I probably won't talk about that again. I'm just gonna ignore it because I don't I hate repeating myself

3054
04:12:08,020 --> 04:12:13,380
It says one of my pet peeves. Uh, if you don't get it the first time, I'm just gonna remove you from my site

3055
04:12:13,940 --> 04:12:18,900
I do not want to look at you. I do not want to perceive you because you cannot follow simple directions. Whoo

3056
04:12:20,340 --> 04:12:23,620
A child could follow simple directions a dog can follow simple directions

3057
04:12:25,060 --> 04:12:27,380
You are an adult you can't so

3058
04:12:28,340 --> 04:12:30,340
Get blocked

3059
04:12:30,740 --> 04:12:33,300

3066
04:12:58,260 --> 04:13:00,260
Oh, they do that

3072
04:13:23,860 --> 04:13:27,540
That's really smart of him to put the pin in wrong. So yeah, I would

04:13:28,500 --> 04:13:30,500
That's also like

3074
04:13:31,780 --> 04:13:33,780
Do you really should you have to do that

3075
04:13:36,980 --> 04:13:43,780
Okay, see he's not scared. Why are you scared? It'll hardly only hurt for like a minute in the rest of your life. So

3076
04:13:45,860 --> 04:13:49,940
Like I don't I don't think I could be with the person who wanted to fucking brand themselves

3077
04:13:50,900 --> 04:13:54,100
At a shady ass tattoo parlor. No, thank you

3078
04:13:59,860 --> 04:14:02,180
Uh, I still have a bush anyways moving on

3079
04:14:02,740 --> 04:14:06,900
Uh, just wondering how do you feel about AI gend images of sheebie?

3080
04:14:07,220 --> 04:14:08,660
I know it is an art, etc

3081
04:14:08,660 --> 04:14:13,460
And it wouldn't drop it in your tags probably just I don't know what that word is if anywhere

3082
04:14:13,940 --> 04:14:17,940
Uh, if you put some time into learning how to use it these days, you can output some nice looking stuff

3083
04:14:17,940 --> 04:14:21,620
This is the usual slop it require creating a trained model of your image though

3084
04:14:21,620 --> 04:14:24,020
Which I want to do without your thumbs up or just I don't care how well

3085
04:14:24,580 --> 04:14:28,180
Thanks for streams regardless. Uh, please do not make AI art of me

3086
04:14:29,940 --> 04:14:32,660
Using my model, please do not feed my model

3087
04:14:33,860 --> 04:14:35,060
uh

3088
04:14:35,060 --> 04:14:38,500
Into any sort of AI thing if you're like

3089
04:14:39,140 --> 04:14:44,500
Just like generating stuff and one just happens to look like me. That's fine. But please do not

3090
04:14:45,620 --> 04:14:47,620
Take my model

3091
04:14:48,420 --> 04:14:50,420
Do that like I

3092
04:14:51,380 --> 04:14:54,900
Am an artist. I also just I don't like it just doesn't look good

3093
04:14:56,260 --> 04:14:59,780
Like what is what is that? Uh, there was like a meme. I think it was like a flork meme like

3094
04:15:00,580 --> 04:15:02,580
uh these like

3095
04:15:03,540 --> 04:15:10,500
This the sex uh post don't mean anything nor anymore. There's no like life behind them. There's not enough horny or whatever the fuck

3096
04:15:11,780 --> 04:15:15,300
Um, yeah, they look weird the art style isn't consistent

3097
04:15:15,780 --> 04:15:18,500
Um, I'm not a huge fan as someone who's an artist

3098
04:15:19,540 --> 04:15:22,660
I'm not a good one, but I'll say I'm an artist. Uh, I would hate that

3099
04:15:23,300 --> 04:15:26,100
Uh, I'd rather you draw a shitty picture of me

3100
04:15:27,220 --> 04:15:29,860
Yourself, that's it. Um

3101
04:15:30,820 --> 04:15:32,820
Again, I can't

3102
04:15:32,820 --> 04:15:35,460
Really police that it's really just like a trust thing

3103
04:15:36,260 --> 04:15:37,540
Um

3104
04:15:37,540 --> 04:15:39,540
If you do it and I see it

3105
04:15:40,020 --> 04:15:42,020
I'm just probably not going to acknowledge it

3106
04:15:42,660 --> 04:15:44,660
Sorry

3107
04:15:45,620 --> 04:15:47,620
Yeah

3108
04:15:53,780 --> 04:15:59,780
I just busted a fat fucking note on the final image of your twitter game. What are you gonna do about it? Nothing

3109
04:16:01,940 --> 04:16:03,940
I don't care

3110
04:16:04,260 --> 04:16:06,260
Some of you have that you talk to me

3111
04:16:06,900 --> 04:16:11,940
Like you're trying to tease me. You're like, oh, what are you gonna do about it? No, I don't like brats

3112
04:16:12,020 --> 04:16:21,700
I'm not I don't like brats. Just behave be a good boy. Sit down bust them out and enjoy yourself. Jesus Christ

3113
04:16:26,660 --> 04:16:29,940
These white boys be tripping walk away

3114
04:16:33,620 --> 04:16:37,620
Is it considered criminal if it's taking three different art styles and blending them together to make a new style

3115
04:16:38,180 --> 04:16:41,220
Yeah, because it's still not original. That's not

3116
04:16:43,780 --> 04:16:45,380
It's not

3117
04:16:45,380 --> 04:16:48,980
that a whole I'm not gonna like go through a whole AI art debate

3118
04:16:50,340 --> 04:16:52,340
because

3119
04:16:53,620 --> 04:16:55,620
Like I just said like

3120
04:16:55,780 --> 04:16:57,780
I'm not a huge fan

3121
04:16:58,260 --> 04:17:00,260
in like when I first was um

3122
04:17:00,980 --> 04:17:02,980
My twitter using my twitter

3123
04:17:03,300 --> 04:17:06,740
I liked like a lot of AI art

3124
04:17:07,300 --> 04:17:14,180
Because I didn't know it was AI and then I go in and I'm like wow the person might have worked must have worked super fucking hard on this

3125
04:17:15,220 --> 04:17:16,260
Wow

3126
04:17:16,260 --> 04:17:21,060
And I looked in their point their fucking profile and they're like generated using blah blah blah and I'm like oh the fuck

3127
04:17:21,060 --> 04:17:24,660
And I went on an unlike shit and then my whole like I kept getting tricked

3128
04:17:25,060 --> 04:17:27,860
I still get tricked and I'm like dude. Just give me good artists

3129
04:17:28,980 --> 04:17:31,540
Just give me good artists and I'd like actual real artists, please

3130
04:17:32,500 --> 04:17:36,660
Oh, but I worked so hard already this prompt this prompt. That's how do you think about you?

3131
04:17:36,660 --> 04:17:39,860
I'm just burping while you're talking because I don't care. Um cool

3132
04:17:40,820 --> 04:17:42,820
Or whatever. I guess

3133
04:17:43,220 --> 04:17:45,220
Wow

3134
04:17:45,220 --> 04:17:47,220
gosh

3135
04:17:48,020 --> 04:17:55,300
Yeah, it's because a lot of the AI art has a distinctive style because there's like one person they mostly fed the algorithm on

3136
04:17:56,260 --> 04:17:59,060
um, I forget what the artist's name is I remember, um

3137
04:18:00,020 --> 04:18:02,340
Reading it the other day. He's like a famous comic artist

3138
04:18:05,540 --> 04:18:08,180
Remember an AI broke out ratioed by one piece to animator

3139
04:18:08,980 --> 04:18:13,060
I remember when like crony called out and a not even she didn't even call somebody out

3140
04:18:13,060 --> 04:18:17,780
She's just like, I don't like this. Can you put this someplace else and they're just like this is an AI and it's like freaked out

3141
04:18:22,580 --> 04:18:24,580
Um

3142
04:18:25,380 --> 04:18:29,300
They put why must you hurt me by shaving twice in one hour relax

3143
04:18:30,500 --> 04:18:33,860
Relax, I got it the first time you don't have to send it to me twice

3144
04:18:35,540 --> 04:18:38,420
Unless you think you made a mistake then I guess I can't really blame you for that

3145
04:18:40,740 --> 04:18:44,260
She just said you oh, yeah, that's what it was. Sorry. I don't really pay attention that much

3146
04:18:44,740 --> 04:18:49,540
Wait, you're half black. How can that dumpy not clap? Did your white half funnel it all to your chest?

3147
04:18:49,940 --> 04:18:56,580
What a travesty she we should have the back bedonk-a-donk that is her god's given right and then her back which suffer less too

3148
04:18:57,060 --> 04:19:04,660
That's not how it works. Also. She could have suffocated the entire harem under her bodacious cheeks such an injustice. Um

3149
04:19:06,340 --> 04:19:08,340
I still have a fat ass

3150
04:19:09,620 --> 04:19:13,780
Wait, I did I literally just tried to move my model as if I'm gonna turn around

3151
04:19:14,180 --> 04:19:16,660
But uh, you can just pretend by my hips

3152
04:19:17,620 --> 04:19:19,620
And how my thighs are

3153
04:19:19,860 --> 04:19:25,860
But yes, it's big. Oh by the way, um when I was messing around with trans making my stuff transparent

3154
04:19:27,540 --> 04:19:29,140
Uh

3155
04:19:29,140 --> 04:19:31,140
I got to see my butt fangs

3156
04:19:31,700 --> 04:19:33,700
I didn't know I had any

3157
04:19:35,140 --> 04:19:37,140
And I was like, oh

3158
04:19:37,860 --> 04:19:39,540
They were whoo

3159
04:19:39,540 --> 04:19:41,380
They were fangin

3160
04:19:41,380 --> 04:19:43,380
They were banging and fangin

3161
04:19:43,620 --> 04:19:46,420
Um, so yeah, you don't have to worry about that

3162
04:19:49,140 --> 04:19:51,140
My nose is itchy

3163
04:19:51,700 --> 04:19:53,460
um

3164
04:19:53,460 --> 04:19:56,740
It's funny because my dad's side all of big butts

3165
04:19:57,780 --> 04:19:59,780
And my mom has a big butt

3166
04:20:01,460 --> 04:20:03,940
But I just don't I guess

3167
04:20:05,700 --> 04:20:07,700
I've been told I have

3168
04:20:07,700 --> 04:20:10,980
A big butt, but I just don't believe people so I could be wrong, you know

3169
04:20:11,860 --> 04:20:13,860
I could be wrong

3170
04:20:14,340 --> 04:20:16,340
Because I just look at strawberries. I'm like, I don't have that

3171
04:20:18,980 --> 04:20:21,140
Me with my flat ass, yeah, but you're a man, so you're fine

3172
04:20:26,340 --> 04:20:27,620
Hello, madame

3173
04:20:27,620 --> 04:20:30,740
Would you be so kind as to bless us with your thigh peak once again?

3174
04:20:31,220 --> 04:20:35,300
I thought I had saved the day you blessed us, but apparently I'd not I checked your twitter

3175
04:20:35,300 --> 04:20:39,780
I'm not to rectify my grievous mistake, but sadly you had already deleted as much to my dismay

3176
04:20:41,540 --> 04:20:43,940
No, I'm not going to you can just wait for the thigh cam

3177
04:20:45,060 --> 04:20:49,140
I was tired of people being like damn you have the goosebumps and I'm like

3178
04:20:50,340 --> 04:20:52,340
Haven't shaved

3179
04:20:52,340 --> 04:20:54,340
I didn't shave my legs for like three days

3180
04:20:54,660 --> 04:20:59,860
Um, and by the way a lot of girls legs look like that even when they do shave

3181
04:21:01,300 --> 04:21:03,220
Uh, they just apply a lot of filters to their shit

3182
04:21:04,740 --> 04:21:07,620
I believe anything you see posted on the internet. Um

3183
04:21:08,020 --> 04:21:14,900
Anyways, you fast become my oshi. I love the energy you bring and I'm glad you let your true self try

3184
04:21:15,700 --> 04:21:21,620
True self shine through. I've been an enjoyer vtuber since COVID lockdown days. I never truly had an oshi

3185
04:21:22,420 --> 04:21:27,860
And I'm glad to call you my oshi. May you you and all the rest of you will be blessed with success and happiness

3186
04:21:31,780 --> 04:21:33,780
That was so nice

3187
04:21:35,140 --> 04:21:37,140
That was so nice

3188
04:21:38,180 --> 04:21:40,580
Wow, the fact that you think

3189
04:21:41,860 --> 04:21:46,820
I am your oshi and you haven't been able to find one and then you see me and I've only been here for like a week

3190
04:21:46,980 --> 04:21:50,260
And uh, that means a lot to me. You don't yeah that just

3191
04:21:51,300 --> 04:21:53,300
I just like it's hard for me to like

3192
04:21:55,380 --> 04:21:57,620
Like why the fuck maybe we like me like it's

3193
04:21:58,260 --> 04:22:02,340
That's just but that's that's everybody everybody has a little side of themselves are like, yeah, but why like how

3194
04:22:02,340 --> 04:22:05,380
Why could you like me like how could you because it's so hard

3195
04:22:06,020 --> 04:22:13,460
to like sometimes accept compliments and reflect on yourself and be like, oh, I do have good qualities and um

3196
04:22:14,180 --> 04:22:16,020
Like I definitely love myself

3197
04:22:16,020 --> 04:22:20,900
But I and like I practice self-love, but I just a lot of stuff. I feel like I don't deserve

3198
04:22:21,460 --> 04:22:26,180
Yes, imposter syndrome. Um, and that's what happens. Like I was very small when I was rena

3199
04:22:26,980 --> 04:22:29,860
Uh, I probably I at most had like a 50

3200
04:22:30,740 --> 04:22:31,700
Uh

3201
04:22:31,700 --> 04:22:33,700
ccb like current viewership

3202
04:22:33,780 --> 04:22:34,820
um

3203
04:22:34,820 --> 04:22:37,700
I only had like a couple regulars in my chat. I mostly had lurkers

3204
04:22:38,420 --> 04:22:39,620
um

3205
04:22:39,620 --> 04:22:43,380
So when I go from that to the sort of audience I have now

3206
04:22:43,780 --> 04:22:48,100
Lots of eyes on me lots of support lots of the it's just it's very overwhelming

3207
04:22:48,580 --> 04:22:51,540
That goes for all the girls. I know mercy is dealing with the same thing right now

3208
04:22:52,180 --> 04:22:54,180
It's like we all can't handle

3209
04:22:54,180 --> 04:22:56,420
being liked as much as we are because like

3210
04:22:57,620 --> 04:22:59,620
We expected so much more hate

3211
04:23:00,580 --> 04:23:04,340
We were fucking mentally prepared to get absolutely shit on by the community

3212
04:23:05,140 --> 04:23:11,540
But it didn't happen. We are okay. And that might be actually due to because we didn't get any sort of coverage from like the drama channels

3213
04:23:12,260 --> 04:23:13,860
um

3214
04:23:13,860 --> 04:23:15,860
because

3215
04:23:16,420 --> 04:23:18,020
like

3216
04:23:18,020 --> 04:23:20,020
like after we like I um

3217
04:23:20,900 --> 04:23:22,900
A lot of people admitted

3218
04:23:23,700 --> 04:23:27,140
That they're like, oh, I thought you were going to crash and burn

3219
04:23:27,620 --> 04:23:30,020
Or this was gonna happen or that was gonna happen

3220
04:23:30,580 --> 04:23:32,580
um, and then they watch us

3221
04:23:32,580 --> 04:23:35,780
And they're like I was actually wrong and I love you

3222
04:23:37,140 --> 04:23:41,780
And I'm like, please just like give people a chance. Yeah, you look at a small agency starting up

3223
04:23:42,020 --> 04:23:46,660
They can surprise you like you may plus surprise me. They have wonderful talented girls

3224
04:23:47,700 --> 04:23:51,540
Um when they first showed up, I remember I was gonna apply to them when they first

3225
04:23:51,940 --> 04:23:56,340
Opened auditions, but I it was too busy with my real job. So I didn't get around to it. Um

3226
04:23:57,620 --> 04:23:59,620
I could have ended up there, you know

3227
04:24:00,420 --> 04:24:02,420
It ended up in the other places I applied to

3228
04:24:03,300 --> 04:24:05,300
um

3229
04:24:05,620 --> 04:24:10,260
Just yeah, and that's okay. You can totally admit like I was one of those people. I was like a naysayer

3230
04:24:11,540 --> 04:24:12,580
because

3231
04:24:12,580 --> 04:24:19,700
You assume the it's not an unusual thing for people to assume the worst so they avoid being disappointed

3232
04:24:20,980 --> 04:24:22,980
But I'm happy

3233
04:24:23,060 --> 04:24:26,340
That we were able to surprise and delight everybody with how

3234
04:24:27,380 --> 04:24:29,140
Wonderful we all are

3235
04:24:29,140 --> 04:24:32,420
Collectively and we all have different niches and different styles and different

3236
04:24:33,380 --> 04:24:35,380
Ways about how we um go about things

3237
04:24:37,380 --> 04:24:39,380
Um

3238
04:24:41,140 --> 04:24:43,140
So, yeah

3239
04:24:43,460 --> 04:24:50,180
Thank god the worst case scenario didn't happen everybody's like, oh, I remember my favorite comment my favorite negative comment that I saw was

3240
04:24:51,540 --> 04:24:53,540
How long is it gonna take

3241
04:24:53,540 --> 04:24:59,860
For one of them for it to come out that one of them is a sexual predator and I'm like Jesus fucking christ

3242
04:25:01,620 --> 04:25:03,620
Are you serious?

3243
04:25:04,740 --> 04:25:08,820
There are so many loutubers in the vtuber community and you be you just assume

3244
04:25:10,340 --> 04:25:12,660
That we're gonna be sexual predator like what?

3245
04:25:15,700 --> 04:25:22,020
I was like that was just like out of malice or something like do you you just you don't want us to succeed and that's why you said that

3246
04:25:22,980 --> 04:25:24,980
like

3247
04:25:24,980 --> 04:25:28,180
That like blew me away generally and this is before I even gotten to be alert

3248
04:25:28,180 --> 04:25:32,740
like even just like being a normal viewer and being excited for the girls like I had like the

3249
04:25:33,860 --> 04:25:35,860
Auditions hadn't even opened yet type thing

3250
04:25:36,980 --> 04:25:41,380
They're like it's gonna be so funny when one of them gets out as a sexual predator or this i'm like

3251
04:25:42,020 --> 04:25:44,020
what the hell

3252
04:25:44,180 --> 04:25:47,220
There's so many different loutubers that are normal people like melody

3253
04:25:48,100 --> 04:25:53,380
Partic melody is a lovely person. She's so sweet her normal streams are adorable

3254
04:25:57,140 --> 04:25:59,620
And then you know you realize people just love to hate

3255
04:26:02,740 --> 04:26:04,740
What they don't know

3256
04:26:04,740 --> 04:26:07,540
We're on a stand yet because we are the first of our kind

3257
04:26:08,180 --> 04:26:10,180
being a lewd focused

3258
04:26:10,420 --> 04:26:12,420
YouTubeing agency

3259
04:26:12,500 --> 04:26:14,500
Normally that isn't the standard

3260
04:26:14,500 --> 04:26:18,340
So I can't blame some of you who are who are just like, uh, I don't really think this will work

3261
04:26:19,380 --> 04:26:20,260
um

3262
04:26:20,260 --> 04:26:26,660
But I will explain the people that are like they're probably horrible human beings like that was I just thought that was a totally

3263
04:26:28,660 --> 04:26:31,060
Terrible thing to say about people you didn't even know yet

3264
04:26:32,020 --> 04:26:34,900
And again, I wasn't even a talent yet. This was like way back when

3265
04:26:35,460 --> 04:26:37,460
dealer was announced

3266
04:26:38,180 --> 04:26:40,180
I was like damn I feel bad for those girls

3267
04:26:40,740 --> 04:26:46,740
When they get picked wow I'm here. Um, yeah reflects more on the speaker. I'm like, what are you saying? What have you done?

3268
04:26:47,220 --> 04:26:49,220
Hmm. Hmm

3269
04:26:49,220 --> 04:26:51,220
um

3270
04:26:51,700 --> 04:26:54,260
Melody collapse someday that'll be great. I hope so

3271
04:26:55,540 --> 04:26:57,540
I would love to learn from her

3272
04:26:58,100 --> 04:27:00,100
Um, I feel like she could teach us a lot

3273
04:27:01,460 --> 04:27:06,340
Her loves to hate and find any reason to do so. Have you seen any of the joked drama? I was like, I don't even know who that is

3274
04:27:07,140 --> 04:27:09,140
What's that? Who is that?

3275
04:27:10,580 --> 04:27:13,620
I think a lot of people just want to watch dramas again. That's true. People love drama

3276
04:27:14,260 --> 04:27:15,380
um

3277
04:27:15,380 --> 04:27:18,180
That sort of stuff pulls eyes gets views

3278
04:27:18,820 --> 04:27:24,900
um, I know that false only really covered us because there was a lot more vocal

3279
04:27:26,180 --> 04:27:28,180
angle to like

3280
04:27:29,700 --> 04:27:32,820
Actually, it was I feel like it was kind of even on both sides in terms of like

3281
04:27:33,540 --> 04:27:35,540
who was

3282
04:27:35,540 --> 04:27:39,540
Not for it and who was and even like, um kaiyo

3283
04:27:40,260 --> 04:27:43,380
And he's was more like a little bit unbiased when he covered the

3284
04:27:44,020 --> 04:27:45,140
um

3285
04:27:45,140 --> 04:27:47,220
The announcement of velour again. This was me

3286
04:27:47,940 --> 04:27:51,540
Observing this when I wasn't even a talent when they first announced auditions

3287
04:27:52,180 --> 04:27:54,180
Um, or not. They first announced the company

3288
04:27:55,060 --> 04:27:57,060
before they announced auditions, um

3289
04:27:58,740 --> 04:28:02,500
He was just like they both I noticed they both started off with the

3290
04:28:03,620 --> 04:28:08,740
A good amount of negative comments that were said about us and like responding to the tweet of them going

3291
04:28:09,300 --> 04:28:10,740
Going live

3292
04:28:10,740 --> 04:28:12,740
um, and then they followed up in the

3293
04:28:13,780 --> 04:28:18,660
There's their cover their cover story of like one or two or three nice things

3294
04:28:20,020 --> 04:28:22,020
And I was like

3295
04:28:22,980 --> 04:28:28,260
And then all the like the comments that were boosted were the more negative ones like yeah, I don't really see this working out

3296
04:28:28,660 --> 04:28:31,140
They're probably gonna burn out or they're probably not gonna want to do it

3297
04:28:31,220 --> 04:28:33,300
Or they're probably gonna do this and probably gonna do that

3298
04:28:33,860 --> 04:28:35,860
Or he just can wait and see what happens

3299
04:28:39,220 --> 04:28:43,780
Um, everyone's going through their own battle attack them now. They're fighting two battles. Boom. Yeah

3300
04:28:45,140 --> 04:28:47,380
Did you decide you I was the first person who applied?

3301
04:28:49,220 --> 04:28:52,100
Starny said I applied 20 minutes after stuff opened

3302
04:28:53,140 --> 04:28:55,780
Uh, I was the first person to apply

3303
04:28:57,940 --> 04:28:59,940
To be there

3304
04:29:00,180 --> 04:29:05,700
That is because I recorded my video three days in advance because I was so anxious. I'm getting it perfectly

3305
04:29:06,020 --> 04:29:08,020
I worked really hard on it

3306
04:29:09,620 --> 04:29:11,620
I

3307
04:29:12,260 --> 04:29:14,260
Yeah, that's the uh

3308
04:29:14,900 --> 04:29:16,900
I was ready. I wanted this for since

3309
04:29:18,020 --> 04:29:20,020
a certain rtx

3310
04:29:20,100 --> 04:29:22,100
strongy mentioned doing it again

3311
04:29:22,980 --> 04:29:26,660
Making her own company. I'm like, I'm in I want that. I didn't think I would get in

3312
04:29:28,260 --> 04:29:30,980
I was so ready to be disappointed. You have no idea

3313
04:29:32,020 --> 04:29:33,300
but

3314
04:29:33,300 --> 04:29:35,300
Yeah, I'm here

3315
04:29:35,300 --> 04:29:36,900
And I'm so happy I am

3316
04:29:36,900 --> 04:29:38,900
Happy I get to be with you guys

3317
04:29:40,500 --> 04:29:45,300
I will just say this melody right now is the godmother of lutubers and she we learn a lot. Yeah, like I'm always

3318
04:29:46,980 --> 04:29:53,140
Uh, like there's a lot of lutubers in the community. Um, that are of course way bigger than us. Um

3319
04:29:54,180 --> 04:29:56,820
People like to like crack jokes and be like, ah

3320
04:29:57,380 --> 04:30:01,140
Everybody's freaking out because like viewers the competition. We're not

3321
04:30:01,940 --> 04:30:04,420
We're not established. We're just starting out

3322
04:30:05,380 --> 04:30:13,220
Um, yes, we are have certain strategies to get support with like our patreon. We have like, you know cheaper options

3323
04:30:13,860 --> 04:30:15,300
um

3324
04:30:15,300 --> 04:30:17,060
well like

3325
04:30:17,060 --> 04:30:19,940
And I can speak for all the girls. We actively want to learn

3326
04:30:20,980 --> 04:30:21,860
from

3327
04:30:21,860 --> 04:30:23,860
the bigger vtubers in the community

3328
04:30:24,420 --> 04:30:26,020
because we

3329
04:30:26,020 --> 04:30:27,540
can learn a lot

3330
04:30:27,540 --> 04:30:28,660
like

3331
04:30:28,660 --> 04:30:30,660
We're just starting out

3332
04:30:30,660 --> 04:30:33,860
A bunch of us were very small before we were in a v in velar

3333
04:30:34,740 --> 04:30:36,740
And didn't even dream of being in a corpo

3334
04:30:37,300 --> 04:30:38,340
uh

3335
04:30:38,340 --> 04:30:40,660
I've only been a vtuber for six months like I've said

3336
04:30:42,100 --> 04:30:43,620
and

3337
04:30:43,620 --> 04:30:48,100
But mind you I've still worked very hard to be here. Don't get it twisted. Um

3338
04:30:48,980 --> 04:30:51,940
If I can grind it out for a very long time

3339
04:30:54,260 --> 04:30:58,500
I heard a velar when I first announced I forgot about it. I only remembered that they have to be a lot of people were like that

3340
04:30:58,500 --> 04:31:00,500
Was funny, uh

3341
04:31:01,060 --> 04:31:03,060
Lost face to grow. Yeah

3342
04:31:04,020 --> 04:31:08,980
Yeah, it's there are a lot of luteubers, but again, there's not a there's not

3343
04:31:09,860 --> 04:31:11,140
Corpo

3344
04:31:11,140 --> 04:31:13,460
luteubers, um, there are

3345
04:31:14,500 --> 04:31:16,500
I can't stop burping with the fuck

3346
04:31:16,740 --> 04:31:17,940
um

3347
04:31:17,940 --> 04:31:19,940
there are

3348
04:31:20,180 --> 04:31:22,180
girls in corpos that

3349
04:31:22,820 --> 04:31:23,540
really

3350
04:31:23,540 --> 04:31:25,540
Fucking dance that line

3351
04:31:25,940 --> 04:31:30,340
Of being completely on say so and doing crazier stuff than

3352
04:31:30,900 --> 04:31:32,900
Or stuff as much as us

3353
04:31:33,860 --> 04:31:37,060
And they just like but they like dress it up in a cute little bow and be like

3354
04:31:39,140 --> 04:31:41,140
I'm not doing anything bad. Um

3355
04:31:41,940 --> 04:31:43,940
There's those girls

3356
04:31:43,940 --> 04:31:47,540
We just say the we I always make the joke we just say the quiet part out loud

3357
04:31:48,180 --> 04:31:49,860
we're like

3358
04:31:49,860 --> 04:31:54,020
Because like a lot of a lot of fucking girls and agencies are like us. They just

3359
04:31:54,740 --> 04:31:56,740
They're just not allowed to do what we do

3360
04:31:57,140 --> 04:31:59,540
They would probably make the content if they um wanted to

3361
04:32:00,100 --> 04:32:03,780
Um, and if they were allowed to by their by their uh companies

3362
04:32:08,180 --> 04:32:12,740
Never heard of you learn till debut personally. Yeah, and that's fine. Like I'm it's glad you're here

3363
04:32:13,460 --> 04:32:17,060
Glad you're here. If you just just caught us on debut if you knew from the beginning

3364
04:32:17,780 --> 04:32:20,980
Um, if you followed strontae before she was strontae then

3365
04:32:21,700 --> 04:32:23,700
Yeah, just

3366
04:32:23,700 --> 04:32:25,700
You can't you were here for a reason

3367
04:32:26,180 --> 04:32:28,180
You're here for a reason

3368
04:32:28,500 --> 04:32:33,140
I almost said a reef link. You're here for a reason rafling. Um

3369
04:32:34,660 --> 04:32:36,660
But yeah

3370
04:32:36,740 --> 04:32:40,820
You can't say I've gone sph for mothers, but you'd be surprised

3371
04:32:40,820 --> 04:32:47,300
They're you'd be surprised because they again they dress it up as other things

3372
04:32:48,180 --> 04:32:53,620
They they tease you with uh, but they just use different words, but it's the intention

3373
04:32:54,340 --> 04:32:56,340
Is that

3374
04:32:57,060 --> 04:33:01,940
Um, but some people now you can just enjoy being you know, the bluntness of just being like, yeah

3375
04:33:02,020 --> 04:33:07,460
I want you to boop out of my beep and made it with a beep on boo with a boop like all that shit. Um

3376
04:33:08,740 --> 04:33:10,740
Yeah

3377
04:33:11,780 --> 04:33:14,340
I apologize for being too needy and chat madam

3378
04:33:15,060 --> 04:33:17,300
You scolding us and ording around honestly

3379
04:33:18,660 --> 04:33:22,580
Can't read that part. Uh, let me she be also you're not a whore you're a madam

3380
04:33:24,980 --> 04:33:26,980
That's funny. Um

3381
04:33:30,580 --> 04:33:35,540
These are just really so exciting at 10 times. Um, I don't really think you guys are needy

3382
04:33:36,500 --> 04:33:40,740
You want I think you got we like some of you complain a lot

3383
04:33:42,020 --> 04:33:46,900
But lately since I've like I said something the other day everybody's kind of shut up. I noticed

3384
04:33:47,780 --> 04:33:49,780
Which is finally nice

3385
04:33:53,060 --> 04:33:55,060
So I guess I will just be more

3386
04:33:56,180 --> 04:34:02,340
Straightforward because normally again, I'm a very nice person. I don't like being mean. Um

3387
04:34:02,980 --> 04:34:04,980
And so sometimes

3388
04:34:05,940 --> 04:34:07,940
I don't want people to think

3389
04:34:08,100 --> 04:34:10,100
That I like genuinely hate them

3390
04:34:10,740 --> 04:34:12,740
Because to be honest with you

3391
04:34:15,220 --> 04:34:20,020
I just don't have the energy to hate people on the internet that just say a mean thing about me

3392
04:34:20,420 --> 04:34:22,420
When I'm just being an anime girl. So like

3393
04:34:24,900 --> 04:34:26,900
Um, yeah

3394
04:34:29,380 --> 04:34:31,380
When I was

3395
04:34:32,100 --> 04:34:34,100
Also, you're not a whore you're a madam

3396
04:34:34,740 --> 04:34:39,220
Uh, while I was thinking of she be uh, your name warped in my thought to

3397
04:34:40,900 --> 04:34:45,780
Shibizi which is very rude. BZ is not a good word for women and I don't think we use BZ. What does that mean?

3398
04:34:46,740 --> 04:34:48,740
Should I not say that out loud?

3399
04:34:49,620 --> 04:34:51,620
Did I fucking just say something inappropriate?

3400
04:35:01,620 --> 04:35:03,620
It

3401
04:35:09,220 --> 04:35:11,460
Means bitch formally used for women

3402
04:35:12,820 --> 04:35:18,260
Oh, it means it's a slang term that means someone who is okay. It's like a bitch. Okay

3403
04:35:19,300 --> 04:35:21,300
Okay, cool

3404
04:35:21,940 --> 04:35:26,340
We're not getting cancelled. We're fine. It's just it was just used to be slang for like just essentially just like

3405
04:35:26,900 --> 04:35:33,220
A colloquial off word slang for a woman boomie. Hi, mr. Titties. Can you get your asshole out of my face?

3406
04:35:33,300 --> 04:35:37,540
You're gonna clean your ass boy. Oh, you are so heavy. Hello, handsome

3407
04:35:38,420 --> 04:35:40,420
What's up? You just want attention?

3408
04:35:41,460 --> 04:35:43,460
You just want attention?

3409
04:35:44,660 --> 04:35:46,660
Do you guys already all eat your all your food?

3410
04:35:48,180 --> 04:35:50,900
I need to refit refill your um feeders

3411
04:35:51,940 --> 04:35:54,660
You put you down. Oh my god. You're so heavy. I think he's like

3412
04:35:55,140 --> 04:35:57,140
15 pounds now. He's such a big cat

3413
04:35:58,580 --> 04:36:00,580
It's all fucking muscles

3414
04:36:12,340 --> 04:36:14,340
Like in my castle tree

3415
04:36:14,340 --> 04:36:16,340
What's this

3416
04:36:23,140 --> 04:36:25,140
Oh, what's this? You want chicken?

3417
04:36:25,540 --> 04:36:27,540
Oh, you want chicken?

3418
04:36:28,180 --> 04:36:30,180
Want chicken?

3419
04:36:34,740 --> 04:36:36,740
And you do the move

3420
04:36:39,460 --> 04:36:41,460
That's the fucking game wire

3421
04:36:44,740 --> 04:36:46,740
No

3422
04:37:09,940 --> 04:37:13,780
Are you guys, like it like a baby girl

3423
04:37:14,340 --> 04:37:29,340
Guys, I can't put it on your plate if your faces are in the film, I'm good.

3424
04:37:29,340 --> 04:37:30,340
Back up.

3425
04:37:30,340 --> 04:37:31,340
Back up.

3426
04:37:31,340 --> 04:37:41,340
Here, relax, relax.

3427
04:37:41,340 --> 04:37:44,340
Come on.

3428
04:37:44,340 --> 04:37:51,340
Right now! Right now! Right now! Right now, where'd you go? Right now!

3429
04:37:51,340 --> 04:37:56,340
Oh, right there. Right, here you go, Mom. Shhh! I don't need to.

3430
04:37:58,340 --> 04:38:02,340
Here, come up. Do you know how to get down? You'll get confused.

3431
04:38:02,340 --> 04:38:06,340
Like, I jumped up here, but I don't know where to go.

3432
04:38:08,340 --> 04:38:09,340
Fuck...

3433
04:38:15,340 --> 04:38:22,340
Okay, give him some wet food as a little treat.

3434
04:38:25,340 --> 04:38:30,340
No, I know you guys can hear me. It's not like... I don't care if you can hear me.

3435
04:38:30,340 --> 04:38:34,340
My informant's fucking small. I only mute for pee.

3436
04:38:36,340 --> 04:38:39,340
I cover all intensely. Let's make sure I talk to our cats.

3437
04:38:45,340 --> 04:38:47,340
What am I reading?

3438
04:38:55,340 --> 04:38:57,340
Bad mute? I didn't mute.

3439
04:39:01,340 --> 04:39:05,340
Distant she be my blood. A flavor of wet food, I give him chicken.

3440
04:39:05,340 --> 04:39:11,340
Oh, is it like those small shorts about little Jimmy who moved bricks for a year and only got an apartment for two square? What?

3441
04:39:12,340 --> 04:39:16,340
I love the stuck in the closet in your house, roughly.

3442
04:39:16,340 --> 04:39:19,340
Mute for pee, bad mute. Oh, I see.

3443
04:39:20,340 --> 04:39:24,340
And once they dried cat food as a kid, that explains a lot.

3444
04:39:26,340 --> 04:39:31,340
It's not like... My house is like pretty normal size, to be honest.

3445
04:39:31,340 --> 04:39:35,340
Like, it's actually bigger than my childhood home, but my childhood home was really small.

3446
04:39:35,340 --> 04:39:40,340
I just have an open concept in my apartment, so that's why it's echoey when you can like...

3447
04:39:41,340 --> 04:39:44,340
Yeah, when I walk away, because they're like, ah!

3448
04:39:44,340 --> 04:39:47,340
Sorry, I don't mean to blow out your fucking eardrums.

3449
04:39:47,340 --> 04:39:54,340
So like, I have my living room area on one half of the room, then I have my kitchen area on one half of the room,

3450
04:39:54,340 --> 04:39:58,340
and then I have my bedroom, and then I have a bathroom, and then I have a giant walking closet,

3451
04:39:58,340 --> 04:40:02,340
because it honestly doubles as a bedroom if I want it.

3452
04:40:02,340 --> 04:40:05,340
Like, I literally probably put it at like a little like sleeping bag down.

3453
04:40:05,340 --> 04:40:07,340
Guys can sleep over, we can have a little sleep over.

3454
04:40:07,340 --> 04:40:09,340
We are in the walls.

3455
04:40:12,340 --> 04:40:18,340
It screws apart from on, where the cage goes.

3456
04:40:18,340 --> 04:40:23,340
Yeah, the cage is um... Actually, the cage is in the living room right next to the TV,

3457
04:40:23,340 --> 04:40:30,340
so you can have some sun, um, because like, I have a balcony as well.

3458
04:40:30,340 --> 04:40:32,340
I need to get furniture for my balcony.

3459
04:40:32,340 --> 04:40:36,340
I've lived here for almost like two years, and I still don't have fucking balcony furniture,

3460
04:40:36,340 --> 04:40:39,340
and like, I go outside and I just stand there awkwardly.

3461
04:40:40,340 --> 04:40:42,340
Oh, I got a fart.

3462
04:40:45,340 --> 04:40:47,340
Nice.

3463
04:40:47,340 --> 04:40:49,340
Um, hammock for the butt.

3464
04:40:49,340 --> 04:40:51,340
No, it's not big enough for that.

3465
04:40:51,340 --> 04:40:56,340
I'd probably get like one of those cute little like, suspended egg chair things,

3466
04:40:56,340 --> 04:41:00,340
or like something I could put my feet up on, just curl up with a book and a blankie.

3467
04:41:02,340 --> 04:41:06,340
I told you, you only get one tooth for free on stream.

3468
04:41:06,340 --> 04:41:08,340
Can you find it? I don't know if you can.

3469
04:41:08,340 --> 04:41:10,340
It's been there.

3470
04:41:10,340 --> 04:41:12,340
Happened in another stream, not this video.

3471
04:41:14,340 --> 04:41:21,340
Uh, anyways, um, the rest of this message makes absolutely no sense.

3472
04:41:26,340 --> 04:41:32,340
Actually, it makes sense, but like, this person was rambling and it's kind of funny.

3473
04:41:32,340 --> 04:41:37,340
They're just like talking about like, the entomology of the word, BZ,

3474
04:41:39,340 --> 04:41:42,340
and like, references and pop culture of the word.

3475
04:41:45,340 --> 04:41:46,340
That's kind of funny.

3476
04:41:48,340 --> 04:41:50,340
This is sorry at the end.

3477
04:41:50,340 --> 04:41:51,340
Probably baked.

3478
04:41:51,340 --> 04:41:52,340
Honestly, sounds like it.

3479
04:41:53,340 --> 04:41:58,340
Shibi, you know what would be really silly?

3480
04:41:58,340 --> 04:42:09,340
You should put Ona on throne and pretend to tie us and use it on us while degrading us for ASMR or a joy for Patreon.

3481
04:42:09,340 --> 04:42:11,340
Would that be silly and funny?

3482
04:42:11,340 --> 04:42:12,340
And ha ha.

3483
04:42:12,340 --> 04:42:14,340
Anyway, love you, you goofy bitch.

3484
04:42:14,340 --> 04:42:15,340
Enduring.

3485
04:42:15,340 --> 04:42:19,340
Um, I don't.

3486
04:42:20,340 --> 04:42:25,340
You want me to buy an Ona and use it on what?

3487
04:42:27,340 --> 04:42:28,340
One of my doze?

3488
04:42:30,340 --> 04:42:31,340
One of my doze of dild?

3489
04:42:31,340 --> 04:42:37,340
Like, I don't, I'd be like, oh, like, I'm gonna look so weird.

3490
04:42:41,340 --> 04:42:42,340
Oh, damn you.

3491
04:42:42,340 --> 04:42:43,340
Damn you.

3492
04:42:44,340 --> 04:42:50,340
Um, the maintenance man is gonna come in for me.

3493
04:42:50,340 --> 04:42:52,340
I ran into him again, by the way.

3494
04:42:52,340 --> 04:42:56,340
I ran into one of the guys, the one of the maintenance men that came in.

3495
04:42:56,340 --> 04:42:57,340
One of them fucking hates me.

3496
04:42:57,340 --> 04:42:59,340
The other one was nice.

3497
04:43:00,340 --> 04:43:06,340
And he held the door opened for me when I was bringing in a giant with a giant ass packages.

3498
04:43:06,340 --> 04:43:08,340
You guys got me from throne.

3499
04:43:09,340 --> 04:43:12,340
I'm like, I'm carrying all my horror merchandise.

3500
04:43:16,340 --> 04:43:18,340
What do you think you do again?

3501
04:43:18,340 --> 04:43:24,340
No, for those of you who don't know, my maintenance men came to change my air filter.

3502
04:43:24,340 --> 04:43:25,340
And oh, hi, Raina.

3503
04:43:25,340 --> 04:43:27,340
Did you enjoy your chicken?

3504
04:43:27,340 --> 04:43:28,340
She just like flopped into my arms.

3505
04:43:28,340 --> 04:43:29,340
How cute.

3506
04:43:31,340 --> 04:43:32,340
Oh, are you going in the bed?

3507
04:43:32,340 --> 04:43:33,340
Okay, there you go.

3508
04:43:34,340 --> 04:43:37,340
Um, they knocked on the door.

3509
04:43:37,340 --> 04:43:38,340
I had my headphones on.

3510
04:43:38,340 --> 04:43:39,340
I didn't hear them.

3511
04:43:39,340 --> 04:43:40,340
So I didn't answer.

3512
04:43:40,340 --> 04:43:41,340
They let themselves in thinking it wasn't home.

3513
04:43:41,340 --> 04:43:42,340
They realized I was there.

3514
04:43:42,340 --> 04:43:44,340
They're like, oh, hey, we're just here to show the filter.

3515
04:43:44,340 --> 04:43:48,340
And I'm like, okay, weird that they didn't like set a notice ahead saying that they're

3516
04:43:48,340 --> 04:43:50,340
going to do that sort of stuff.

3517
04:43:50,340 --> 04:43:58,340
I realized after they left, I had left toys everywhere in a door hanger thing that says

3518
04:43:58,340 --> 04:44:00,340
do not disturb, but masturbate.

3519
04:44:03,340 --> 04:44:08,340
And then one of them told on me for having cats.

3520
04:44:10,340 --> 04:44:11,340
They have an extra cat.

3521
04:44:11,340 --> 04:44:12,340
I have a bonus cat.

3522
04:44:13,340 --> 04:44:16,340
I think it was a dude that always looks at me to discuss when he sees me.

3523
04:44:16,340 --> 04:44:20,340
The other guy just like looks at me sheepishly like he doesn't know what to do with himself.

3524
04:44:21,340 --> 04:44:29,340
Um, they're new because like we, I, I'm like, they go through maintenance men so much because

3525
04:44:29,340 --> 04:44:34,340
there was another guy that came in like a month ago to fix my, because I have a trash.

3526
04:44:34,340 --> 04:44:35,340
What is it called?

3527
04:44:35,340 --> 04:44:37,340
Uh, trash disposal.

3528
04:44:37,340 --> 04:44:42,340
And it wasn't working because it wasn't like there was like some, apparently I thought

3529
04:44:42,340 --> 04:44:45,340
something came on screwed, but there was apparently just like something in there that got stuck.

3530
04:44:45,340 --> 04:44:48,340
Um, and it was like this totally different guy.

3531
04:44:48,340 --> 04:44:49,340
And then there's other guys.

3532
04:44:49,340 --> 04:44:50,340
Okay.

3533
04:44:50,340 --> 04:44:51,340
I'm like, I've never seen you before.

3534
04:44:51,340 --> 04:44:52,340
Who are you?

3535
04:44:52,340 --> 04:44:55,340
And that's why I was like, I initially freaked out cause I'm like, I've never, these, you

3536
04:44:55,340 --> 04:44:56,340
are not the normal maintenance man.

3537
04:44:56,340 --> 04:44:57,340
The fuck?

3538
04:44:59,340 --> 04:45:01,340
There was somebody before that and I haven't seen them.

3539
04:45:02,340 --> 04:45:04,340
I'm like, they're killing the maintenance men.

3540
04:45:04,340 --> 04:45:06,340
They're just like, you didn't do a good job.

3541
04:45:06,340 --> 04:45:07,340
Death.

3542
04:45:08,340 --> 04:45:13,340
They're just replacing them like, like, uh, cast members and they're hoping that you don't

3543
04:45:13,340 --> 04:45:14,340
even notice.

3544
04:45:17,340 --> 04:45:19,340
Um, but yeah, what?

3545
04:45:22,340 --> 04:45:26,340
I thought like half just growling, but something was just like, there's like, sometimes a,

3546
04:45:26,340 --> 04:45:30,340
my bathroom fan like vibrates a certain way and it's freaked me out.

3547
04:45:30,340 --> 04:45:34,340
Um, man, I hate when rental staff don't give the heads up.

3548
04:45:34,340 --> 04:45:36,340
Oh, at least an apartment that way.

3549
04:45:36,340 --> 04:45:37,340
Yeah.

3550
04:45:37,340 --> 04:45:39,340
That's why I'm like, I feel like legally and where I'm from, they're not allowed to do

3551
04:45:39,340 --> 04:45:40,340
that.

3552
04:45:40,340 --> 04:45:41,340
They have to give 24 hour notice.

3553
04:45:41,340 --> 04:45:47,340
So I was going to bring that up when I went to the landlord and I was like, Hey, you guys

3554
04:45:47,340 --> 04:45:50,340
technically came in when you weren't supposed to get a heads up.

3555
04:45:50,340 --> 04:45:51,340
I was from the spot.

3556
04:45:51,340 --> 04:45:54,340
That's why I said you could come in and it ended up being like, I, but I didn't even

3557
04:45:54,340 --> 04:45:56,340
have to use that because the lady was chill anyways.

3558
04:45:56,340 --> 04:45:59,340
It was just the other bitch property manager that was being annoying.

3559
04:45:59,340 --> 04:46:00,340
I was like, Oh, you're, you're fine.

3560
04:46:00,340 --> 04:46:01,340
You're a good tenant.

3561
04:46:01,340 --> 04:46:02,340
And I'm like, thank you.

3562
04:46:02,340 --> 04:46:03,340
Thank you so much.

3563
04:46:07,340 --> 04:46:08,340
Yeah.

3564
04:46:08,340 --> 04:46:09,340
I got you for maintenance, man.

3565
04:46:15,340 --> 04:46:18,340
As a person who mainly came for the Fendham vibes, I was shocked that I got a female bro

3566
04:46:18,340 --> 04:46:19,340
along for the ride.

3567
04:46:19,340 --> 04:46:21,340
Oh, bro.

3568
04:46:22,340 --> 04:46:26,340
Looking forward to your future endeavors and hopefully you get more of those awesome

3569
04:46:26,340 --> 04:46:27,340
dubs of yours.

3570
04:46:27,340 --> 04:46:33,340
Yes, you are more dubs coming soon, coming right at you like right in your face, coming

3571
04:46:33,340 --> 04:46:34,340
in your face.

3572
04:46:34,340 --> 04:46:36,340
Don't you, don't you worry about it.

3573
04:46:37,340 --> 04:46:42,340
Um, yeah, you're my bros.

3574
04:46:42,340 --> 04:46:45,340
We're bros and sometimes make out.

3575
04:46:45,340 --> 04:46:48,340
Sometimes, you know, some of you, my boyfriend, girlfriend, if you're into that, you know,

3576
04:46:48,340 --> 04:46:51,340
boyfriend, girlfriend, Ryan Gosling voice, boyfriend, girlfriend.

3577
04:46:55,340 --> 04:46:58,340
Don't, you know, let me get to your head.

3578
04:46:59,340 --> 04:47:00,340
Okay.

3579
04:47:00,340 --> 04:47:03,340
Some of you are dogs and I'm your owner.

3580
04:47:03,340 --> 04:47:06,340
You can decide what you want us to be.

3581
04:47:06,340 --> 04:47:08,340
I will give you that one freedom.

3582
04:47:08,340 --> 04:47:09,340
Okay.

3583
04:47:09,340 --> 04:47:13,340
This got that GF bro.

3584
04:47:13,340 --> 04:47:21,340
Yeah, I can be your bro, Brogif, your bro GF Brogif, you know, but I'm glad that like

3585
04:47:21,340 --> 04:47:27,340
I, I'm happy that I pleasantly surprised people because people are like, oh, she's going to

3586
04:47:27,340 --> 04:47:31,340
be like this really reserved Dom and be like this and like that and just be like really

3587
04:47:31,340 --> 04:47:33,340
like, really like maybe like coup d'etre.

3588
04:47:33,340 --> 04:47:41,340
Um, I thought about being that and I'm like, you know, I'm going to be my authentic.

3589
04:47:41,340 --> 04:47:44,340
Nah, I'm going to do me.

3590
04:47:44,340 --> 04:47:46,340
Um, I want to be my authentic self.

3591
04:47:46,340 --> 04:47:56,340
I don't like lying and then it probably would fade away after a month or two anyways.

3592
04:47:58,340 --> 04:47:59,340
Authentic self, best self.

3593
04:47:59,340 --> 04:48:00,340
Yeah.

3594
04:48:00,340 --> 04:48:03,340
So even though the other girls struggle with that, be like, oh, should I act a certain

3595
04:48:03,340 --> 04:48:04,340
way?

3596
04:48:04,340 --> 04:48:06,340
And then in the end, like strong, he just really nailed.

3597
04:48:06,340 --> 04:48:09,340
She's like, I hired you for you.

3598
04:48:09,340 --> 04:48:15,340
I didn't hire you because like of this, this or that you could do this voice or do that

3599
04:48:15,340 --> 04:48:16,340
or do that.

3600
04:48:16,340 --> 04:48:22,340
Like I hired you for your personality and I was like, takes mom wipes away tears.

3601
04:48:22,340 --> 04:48:25,340
Um, you can be my ex.

3602
04:48:25,340 --> 04:48:27,340
I got everything in the divorce.

3603
04:48:27,340 --> 04:48:28,340
Sorry.

3604
04:48:28,340 --> 04:48:29,340
Shut it in a prenup.

3605
04:48:29,340 --> 04:48:42,340
Um, if you were to hypothetically allow us to send proof of us following instructions,

3606
04:48:42,340 --> 04:48:45,340
what would that be?

3607
04:48:45,340 --> 04:48:48,340
If the answer to above is I might be going too far.

3608
04:48:48,340 --> 04:48:51,340
Could we chat, get a bonk instead?

3609
04:48:52,340 --> 04:48:59,340
Uh, most of you have already done so.

3610
04:48:59,340 --> 04:49:02,340
So I'm like, I guess I'm fine with it.

3611
04:49:02,340 --> 04:49:03,340
I don't know.

3612
04:49:03,340 --> 04:49:05,340
Um, yeah, I don't.

3613
04:49:05,340 --> 04:49:07,340
I don't know.

3614
04:49:07,340 --> 04:49:09,340
I bonk chat anyways.

3615
04:49:09,340 --> 04:49:11,340
We're bonking right now.

3616
04:49:11,340 --> 04:49:12,340
Okay.

3617
04:49:12,340 --> 04:49:13,340
Sorry.

3618
04:49:13,340 --> 04:49:16,340
Let me refresh this.

3619
04:49:17,340 --> 04:49:21,340
Oh, now I have to go through and physically answer these.

3620
04:49:21,340 --> 04:49:23,340
Eventually, maybe I won't.

3621
04:49:23,340 --> 04:49:25,340
I might be a little bit too lazy for that.

3622
04:49:25,340 --> 04:49:32,340
Um, I need to scratch my booty.

3623
04:49:32,340 --> 04:49:34,340
My booty cheeky.

3624
04:49:34,340 --> 04:49:39,340
Um, outside of a stream chat and especially on other social media platforms, what would

3625
04:49:39,340 --> 04:49:44,340
you say their dues and don'ts when coming to talking comes to talking interacting with

3626
04:49:44,340 --> 04:49:45,340
you?

3627
04:49:45,340 --> 04:49:49,340
Uh, you guys have interacted me with me pretty normally.

3628
04:49:49,340 --> 04:49:55,340
I can't really think of anything that sticks out besides the people that have complained

3629
04:49:55,340 --> 04:49:58,340
about like the doming on like not being a dom enough.

3630
04:49:58,340 --> 04:50:01,340
But I've already addressed that, uh, going forward from the stream.

3631
04:50:01,340 --> 04:50:02,340
I'm not going to address it anymore.

3632
04:50:02,340 --> 04:50:06,340
You're just going to get blocked and ignored because, uh, madam shouldn't have to repeat

3633
04:50:06,340 --> 04:50:10,340
herself, especially to dumbasses who complain like that.

3634
04:50:10,340 --> 04:50:14,340
Um, into the other girls too, by the way, if you complain about them.

3635
04:50:15,340 --> 04:50:16,340
Oh, I see.

3636
04:50:16,340 --> 04:50:17,340
Isn't this enough?

3637
04:50:17,340 --> 04:50:18,340
Amy isn't this enough?

3638
04:50:18,340 --> 04:50:19,340
Mercy isn't this enough?

3639
04:50:19,340 --> 04:50:20,340
Azura isn't this enough?

3640
04:50:20,340 --> 04:50:21,340
Strawny isn't this enough?

3641
04:50:21,340 --> 04:50:24,340
I'm just literally going to ignore you.

3642
04:50:24,340 --> 04:50:29,980
Just like there's so many other girls, uh, in different agencies and Indies that will

3643
04:50:29,980 --> 04:50:32,340
probably be better up your alley then.

3644
04:50:32,340 --> 04:50:35,980
Um, I'm not a pushover.

3645
04:50:35,980 --> 04:50:38,340
I'm not going to bend to your will.

3646
04:50:38,340 --> 04:50:40,140
Uh, I am in control here.

3647
04:50:40,140 --> 04:50:42,340
Do not forget that.

3648
04:50:43,340 --> 04:50:53,340
Uh, I think I'm trying to think of, uh, probably maybe the people that like role play being

3649
04:50:54,340 --> 04:51:03,340
Dom with me, like that's kind of, it's not even like, oh, you're trying to like

3650
04:51:04,340 --> 04:51:09,340
Dom me because I'm a dom or like fighting for, you know, being the alpha or whatever

3651
04:51:09,340 --> 04:51:10,340
the fuck.

3652
04:51:10,340 --> 04:51:13,340
It just comes off so fucking cringy.

3653
04:51:13,340 --> 04:51:19,340
Like, like somebody sent me something like, oh, what if I were to come in and tie you

3654
04:51:19,340 --> 04:51:23,340
to the bed and use you the way that I want to, and then you don't have, you don't get

3655
04:51:23,340 --> 04:51:26,340
to say anything and I get to be used, use free use.

3656
04:51:26,340 --> 04:51:30,340
I'm like, I just didn't respond.

3657
04:51:30,340 --> 04:51:32,340
I just blocked him as the next person.

3658
04:51:32,340 --> 04:51:38,340
I'm like, I wouldn't do anything, uh, because that wouldn't happen.

3659
04:51:40,340 --> 04:51:42,340
I would call the police.

3660
04:51:45,340 --> 04:51:50,340
Uh, like, yeah, they're trying to find the switch button, but it's like, it's not, you're

3661
04:51:50,340 --> 04:51:51,340
not going to get that.

3662
04:51:51,340 --> 04:51:58,340
Like the, you're not like, I am a Dom first and foremost.

3663
04:51:58,340 --> 04:52:03,340
My audios might reflect differently because the scripts I have to fill on stream.

3664
04:52:03,340 --> 04:52:05,340
I'm your mother.

3665
04:52:05,340 --> 04:52:08,340
You do well to behave.

3666
04:52:08,340 --> 04:52:09,340
All right.

3667
04:52:09,340 --> 04:52:11,340
Uh, I'm your madam.

3668
04:52:11,340 --> 04:52:12,340
I'm your mother.

3669
04:52:12,340 --> 04:52:14,340
I'm your owner.

3670
04:52:14,340 --> 04:52:16,340
I wear the pants in the relationship.

3671
04:52:16,340 --> 04:52:18,340
You do not.

3672
04:52:18,340 --> 04:52:21,340
Uh, I might be sweet.

3673
04:52:21,340 --> 04:52:28,340
I might be nice to you because I'm a human being and Dom's aren't dicks all the time,

3674
04:52:28,340 --> 04:52:29,340
by the way.

3675
04:52:29,340 --> 04:52:30,340
I hope you knew that.

3676
04:52:30,340 --> 04:52:33,340
Uh, they're just not fucking beating the shit out of people 24 seven.

3677
04:52:33,340 --> 04:52:34,340
That's fucking stupid.

3678
04:52:34,340 --> 04:52:37,340
If you think that, um, I'm going to be nice to you when I want to be.

3679
04:52:37,340 --> 04:52:44,340
And I'm going to treat you terribly when I see there's an opportunity and you seem that

3680
04:52:44,340 --> 04:52:46,340
you want me to do that.

3681
04:52:46,340 --> 04:52:48,340
Um, could you be my father too?

3682
04:52:48,340 --> 04:52:49,340
Yeah.

3683
04:52:49,340 --> 04:52:50,340
I'm your daddy.

3684
04:52:50,340 --> 04:52:51,340
Call me daddy.

3685
04:52:51,340 --> 04:52:52,340
Call me daddy right now.

3686
04:52:52,340 --> 04:52:53,340
I'm waiting for it.

3687
04:52:53,340 --> 04:53:03,340
When did you call daddy and chat?

3688
04:53:03,340 --> 04:53:04,340
Perfect.

3689
04:53:04,340 --> 04:53:07,340
Oh, actually, I like being called daddy.

3690
04:53:07,340 --> 04:53:08,340
Hello.

3691
04:53:08,340 --> 04:53:13,340
It's kind of, it's kind of hot seeing like guys be like, yes, daddy.

3692
04:53:13,340 --> 04:53:14,340
It's kind of hot.

3693
04:53:14,340 --> 04:53:15,340
I don't know.

3694
04:53:15,340 --> 04:53:17,340
Did that just awaken something in me?

3695
04:53:17,340 --> 04:53:18,340
Damn.

3696
04:53:18,340 --> 04:53:20,340
Maybe it's like the corruption.

3697
04:53:20,340 --> 04:53:25,340
Um, noted.

3698
04:53:25,340 --> 04:53:33,340
Uh, I think that's definitely like a gender role thing, like reversal.

3699
04:53:34,340 --> 04:53:37,340
Like I am, I'm the man, this relationship or the woman.

3700
04:53:37,340 --> 04:53:38,340
Maybe that's, maybe that's it.

3701
04:53:38,340 --> 04:53:39,340
I don't know.

3702
04:53:39,340 --> 04:53:41,340
I have to dive into that.

3703
04:53:41,340 --> 04:53:46,340
She got unlocked again.

3704
04:53:46,340 --> 04:53:51,340
Dad, please put the belt down.

3705
04:53:51,340 --> 04:53:52,340
Not again.

3706
04:53:52,340 --> 04:53:53,340
Not the belt.

3707
04:53:53,340 --> 04:53:54,340
That shit hurts.

3708
04:53:54,340 --> 04:54:01,340
I've hit myself with a belt because my mom, my mom and my dad were like, oh, we were

3709
04:54:01,340 --> 04:54:02,340
going to use a belt.

3710
04:54:02,340 --> 04:54:03,340
You're lucky we don't use a belt on you.

3711
04:54:03,340 --> 04:54:04,340
And I'm like, yeah, this doesn't hurt.

3712
04:54:04,340 --> 04:54:08,340
And I was like, ah, on my arm.

3713
04:54:08,340 --> 04:54:13,340
Daddy, she be model one, like as in my dad, dad or like me as a dude, because I would

3714
04:54:13,340 --> 04:54:15,340
look, I would be the sexiest.

3715
04:54:15,340 --> 04:54:16,340
What is it?

3716
04:54:16,340 --> 04:54:27,340
Ikeman, Ikeman, Ikeman, Ikeman.

3717
04:54:27,340 --> 04:54:29,340
I was deaf spanked as a kid.

3718
04:54:29,340 --> 04:54:30,340
Okay.

3719
04:54:30,340 --> 04:54:40,340
I have to share that.

3720
04:54:40,340 --> 04:54:50,340
Oh, to be belted by daddy, she be.

3721
04:54:50,340 --> 04:54:51,340
That's me come to papa.

3722
04:54:51,340 --> 04:54:56,340
And you just like not on my leg or something because you're humping it or whatever.

3723
04:54:56,340 --> 04:55:09,340
Yeah, I think just people trying to be that because they're like, yeah, they're trying

3724
04:55:09,340 --> 04:55:13,340
to like, think I'll be submissive with them.

3725
04:55:13,340 --> 04:55:19,340
Um, no, no.

3726
04:55:19,340 --> 04:55:27,340
Even if you like, even if I was like, like if I was in like icy shoes and I was like

3727
04:55:27,340 --> 04:55:34,420
doing her character and her niche and she is like, definitely a switch because she's

3728
04:55:34,420 --> 04:55:38,340
like, you know, I keep, I keep smacking the mic with my hands because I throw them around.

3729
04:55:38,340 --> 04:55:40,340
Like she's a cute little girl.

3730
04:55:40,340 --> 04:55:42,340
You're her odyssin.

3731
04:55:42,340 --> 04:55:45,340
But then she's like a little feral polar bear.

3732
04:55:45,340 --> 04:55:54,340
Like, even if you talk to me like that when I was in like my cute space, um, I would literally

3733
04:55:54,340 --> 04:55:56,340
just like want to fucking punch you because that's cringy as fuck.

3734
04:55:56,340 --> 04:55:58,340
And that's not how you do that.

3735
04:55:58,340 --> 04:56:05,340
Like there is a right way to Dom and there's a right way to be a sub in the way that some

3736
04:56:05,340 --> 04:56:11,340
of you guys try to Dom is so fucking pathetic.

3737
04:56:12,340 --> 04:56:14,340
Father, may I have a piece?

3738
04:56:14,340 --> 04:56:15,340
Oh, come here.

3739
04:56:15,340 --> 04:56:16,340
It's funny.

3740
04:56:16,340 --> 04:56:19,340
One of my, um, emotes is me going up ease.

3741
04:56:19,340 --> 04:56:22,340
So you guys will be able to use that.

3742
04:56:22,340 --> 04:56:24,340
It just knows the rabbit mouth.

3743
04:56:24,340 --> 04:56:25,340
Yeah.

3744
04:56:25,340 --> 04:56:26,340
I like having this on.

3745
04:56:26,340 --> 04:56:27,340
I prefer it.

3746
04:56:27,340 --> 04:56:29,340
It prefer Dom and women.

3747
04:56:29,340 --> 04:56:30,340
Yeah.

3748
04:56:30,340 --> 04:56:36,340
I'm like, you have, I'm like, you definitely have never touched a woman before.

3749
04:56:36,340 --> 04:56:37,340
You won't.

3750
04:56:37,340 --> 04:56:44,340
It's like, this is like you talk like how you only watch porn, you know, it's no right

3751
04:56:44,340 --> 04:56:45,340
way to be Dom.

3752
04:56:45,340 --> 04:56:48,340
But looking at some of these messages, the chair is the wrong way.

3753
04:56:48,340 --> 04:56:49,340
Exactly.

3754
04:56:49,340 --> 04:56:56,340
Cause I have like, and it's funny because like I've seen like some of the stuff like you'll

3755
04:56:56,340 --> 04:57:02,340
send like Amy and I see or like kind of like the target demographic for being like, like

3756
04:57:02,340 --> 04:57:04,340
their subs.

3757
04:57:04,340 --> 04:57:07,340
Like, and nobody talks to them like that.

3758
04:57:07,340 --> 04:57:11,340
Like they, they, like they treat them with respect.

3759
04:57:11,340 --> 04:57:16,340
They're like, oh, I just want to take care of you, pan for you, do this, do that.

3760
04:57:16,340 --> 04:57:21,340
And then like sometimes they'll say something a little bit more charged, but it's never

3761
04:57:21,340 --> 04:57:25,340
like, I'm just going to like, what if I did this to you and did that?

3762
04:57:25,340 --> 04:57:27,340
Like, what are you going to do about it?

3763
04:57:27,340 --> 04:57:30,340
I'm like, nobody sends them that shit.

3764
04:57:30,340 --> 04:57:32,340
They send them normal shit.

3765
04:57:32,340 --> 04:57:36,340
I'm like, why are you sending me the shit?

3766
04:57:36,340 --> 04:57:40,340
I literally, I remember there's like one, somebody said something like that.

3767
04:57:40,340 --> 04:57:43,340
And I was like, I see, come get your OG son.

3768
04:57:43,340 --> 04:57:48,340
And she's like, I don't want him.

3769
04:57:48,340 --> 04:57:49,340
Yeah.

3770
04:57:49,340 --> 04:57:54,340
It's like people have this idea of like what it is to be this or that.

3771
04:57:54,340 --> 04:58:01,340
And it's, it's, and honestly, like porn has a, I keep smacking the microphone because

3772
04:58:01,340 --> 04:58:05,340
it's right near my hand.

3773
04:58:05,340 --> 04:58:12,340
It is because of porn perpetuates on like kind of like role stereotypes for things because

3774
04:58:12,340 --> 04:58:16,340
like you always see the fucking girl getting choked out, pounded.

3775
04:58:16,340 --> 04:58:17,340
Oh, yes, daddy.

3776
04:58:17,340 --> 04:58:18,340
Oh, yes, daddy.

3777
04:58:18,340 --> 04:58:19,340
Oh, yes, please.

3778
04:58:19,340 --> 04:58:20,340
Oh, yeah, you fucking shit.

3779
04:58:20,340 --> 04:58:30,340
Like, no, it's not real.

3780
04:58:31,340 --> 04:58:33,340
Their existence challenges their masculinity.

3781
04:58:33,340 --> 04:58:35,340
They don't know how to deal with that.

3782
04:58:35,340 --> 04:58:45,340
But like, but like, if I challenge your masculinity, you don't have to interact with me.

3783
04:58:45,340 --> 04:58:53,340
Like that's like you don't, like people feel like they have been like they need to like

3784
04:58:53,340 --> 04:58:57,340
they have to respond to something you don't have to.

3785
04:58:57,340 --> 04:59:01,340
Like if you don't like me, you don't have to watch me right now.

3786
04:59:01,340 --> 04:59:06,340
If I'm not your cup of tea, you can watch one of the other girls that you're totally fucking

3787
04:59:06,340 --> 04:59:08,340
entitled to that.

3788
04:59:08,340 --> 04:59:11,340
Like you don't have to try to prove yourself.

3789
04:59:11,340 --> 04:59:14,340
You're the alpha male.

3790
04:59:14,340 --> 04:59:16,340
Just be a regular dude.

3791
04:59:16,340 --> 04:59:18,340
Just be yourself.

3792
04:59:18,340 --> 04:59:19,340
Please.

3793
04:59:19,340 --> 04:59:21,340
Emotional damage.

3794
04:59:21,340 --> 04:59:25,340
It is real emotional damage.

3795
04:59:25,340 --> 04:59:29,340
Everybody's sending me really cheesy jokes now.

3796
04:59:29,340 --> 04:59:32,340
It's illegal to laugh out loud in Hawaii.

3797
04:59:32,340 --> 04:59:34,340
You have to keep it a low hot.

3798
04:59:34,340 --> 04:59:35,340
Fucking God.

3799
04:59:35,340 --> 04:59:36,340
I've heard that one before.

3800
04:59:36,340 --> 04:59:39,340
You guys fucking suck.

3801
04:59:39,340 --> 04:59:40,340
Oh, another one.

3802
04:59:40,340 --> 04:59:42,340
Why did Sherlock Holmes go to the Mexican restaurant?

3803
04:59:42,340 --> 04:59:45,340
He was looking for a good case of Dia.

3804
04:59:45,340 --> 04:59:47,340
Good case idea.

3805
04:59:47,340 --> 04:59:49,340
Good case of Dia.

3806
04:59:49,340 --> 04:59:54,340
Oh, you guys are so fucking funny.

3807
04:59:54,340 --> 04:59:55,340
Hi, CB.

3808
04:59:55,340 --> 04:59:57,340
I just want to say, congrats on your debut.

3809
04:59:57,340 --> 05:00:01,340
You've been working so hard and streaming daily more than once daily most days.

3810
05:00:01,340 --> 05:00:03,340
And I really appreciate your content.

3811
05:00:03,340 --> 05:00:07,340
Also enjoy how really you are with us, your chat and your crazy antics always make me smile.

3812
05:00:07,340 --> 05:00:09,340
Thanks very much for all your hard work.

3813
05:00:09,340 --> 05:00:13,340
You're truly another one of your followers.

3814
05:00:13,340 --> 05:00:15,340
Thank you so much.

3815
05:00:15,340 --> 05:00:22,340
I always thought it was a detriment to my content that I talk so much and that I overshared.

3816
05:00:22,340 --> 05:00:27,340
And then I realized people really appreciate that transparency.

3817
05:00:27,340 --> 05:00:28,340
And I'll be honest with you.

3818
05:00:28,340 --> 05:00:36,340
I'll watch other streamers and I don't think they talk as bluntly as I do.

3819
05:00:36,340 --> 05:00:38,340
I hear a weird noise.

3820
05:00:38,340 --> 05:00:40,340
Oh, it's boomie hysteric.

3821
05:00:40,340 --> 05:00:52,340
He's pushing a one of the cat bowls around full of the food because he's like pushing it as he's eating.

3822
05:00:52,340 --> 05:00:55,340
And I don't mean like I'm blunt in a negative way.

3823
05:00:55,340 --> 05:00:58,340
Sometimes it can be.

3824
05:00:58,340 --> 05:01:07,340
Sometimes I let myself kind of go too far and say things that I probably shouldn't.

3825
05:01:07,340 --> 05:01:17,340
But I feel like with most restrictions or like ideas of how someone should be in a community.

3826
05:01:17,340 --> 05:01:23,340
Like I really pride myself on these deep talks that we have.

3827
05:01:23,340 --> 05:01:26,340
I personally I don't get those a lot.

3828
05:01:26,340 --> 05:01:33,340
Especially like I can't really talk about like VTubing stuff with people except for you guys.

3829
05:01:33,340 --> 05:01:37,340
I don't have any people that like friends that watch VTubers.

3830
05:01:37,340 --> 05:01:43,340
So yeah, I love these talks.

3831
05:01:43,340 --> 05:01:47,340
Yeah, I'm a little crazy.

3832
05:01:47,340 --> 05:01:48,340
I'm a little cuckoo.

3833
05:01:48,340 --> 05:01:50,340
I'm a silly, silly Billy.

3834
05:01:50,340 --> 05:01:57,340
As for my streaming schedule, it's going to be a bummer because next week I'm not streaming as much.

3835
05:01:57,340 --> 05:02:01,340
I'm going to probably be streaming for the minimum two hours each time.

3836
05:02:02,340 --> 05:02:05,340
Just because I have to work.

3837
05:02:05,340 --> 05:02:08,340
I am actually working full shifts.

3838
05:02:08,340 --> 05:02:13,340
I don't start my part-time job for a couple of weeks, which fucking sucks.

3839
05:02:13,340 --> 05:02:16,340
I might...

3840
05:02:16,340 --> 05:02:25,340
I am debating on leaving my job completely and just kind of throwing it to the wind.

3841
05:02:25,340 --> 05:02:32,340
Yeah, I'm just debating to not even bother with a part-time job.

3842
05:02:32,340 --> 05:02:35,340
Just because it'll be...

3843
05:02:35,340 --> 05:02:36,340
I'll be honest with you.

3844
05:02:36,340 --> 05:02:42,340
I don't know if I'll have the same energy because if I'm working eight hour shifts interacting with people all day and talking all day,

3845
05:02:42,340 --> 05:02:47,340
I'm not going to want to talk as much.

3846
05:02:47,340 --> 05:02:53,340
But then I remember I did it back when I was an indie, so I'm like, I can do it again.

3847
05:02:53,340 --> 05:02:59,340
So I will try my best. Please be patient with me.

3848
05:02:59,340 --> 05:03:02,340
I have like a couple days off a week.

3849
05:03:02,340 --> 05:03:09,340
I will be taking more days off just so I can recharge because I've been streaming every day for multiple hours.

3850
05:03:09,340 --> 05:03:12,340
I've been pulling a strone.

3851
05:03:12,340 --> 05:03:19,340
And like this person said, I have been streaming twice a day like I'm doing today.

3852
05:03:19,340 --> 05:03:26,340
So I know you're probably used to my consistent time as well of being 4pm Eastern time.

3853
05:03:26,340 --> 05:03:29,340
That is probably going to change in the next few weeks.

3854
05:03:29,340 --> 05:03:32,340
But again, honest, if...

3855
05:03:32,340 --> 05:03:42,340
If I perform well enough and Patreon does well, everything does well,

3856
05:03:42,340 --> 05:03:47,340
again, I will probably fucking quit my job and just try to do this full time.

3857
05:03:47,340 --> 05:03:53,340
And maybe I'll do it anyways, even if I don't have the target amount that I want to make yet.

3858
05:03:53,340 --> 05:03:55,340
Oh, aren't you funny.

3859
05:03:55,340 --> 05:03:56,340
Dumbloser tipped $4.

3860
05:03:56,340 --> 05:03:58,340
Thanks Dumbloser.

3861
05:03:58,340 --> 05:04:03,340
Hello mom, I would like to beg for attention by donowing money to disrupt your stream with a funny joke.

3862
05:04:03,340 --> 05:04:05,340
Oh, lovely.

3863
05:04:05,340 --> 05:04:09,340
A woman walked into a bar. She said out.

3864
05:04:09,340 --> 05:04:15,340
That was so fucking stupid.

3865
05:04:16,340 --> 05:04:19,340
The name was pretty apt.

3866
05:04:19,340 --> 05:04:21,340
Name checks out.

3867
05:04:21,340 --> 05:04:25,340
Was it an owl?

3868
05:04:25,340 --> 05:04:26,340
She said a woman.

3869
05:04:26,340 --> 05:04:28,340
He said a woman walks into a bar.

3870
05:04:28,340 --> 05:04:33,340
She said out.

3871
05:04:33,340 --> 05:04:38,340
I've heard like the two men walking to the bar and they say out and honestly I find that funny.

3872
05:04:38,340 --> 05:04:41,340
Funny joke.

3873
05:04:42,340 --> 05:04:44,340
I didn't get the first part of the joke.

3874
05:04:44,340 --> 05:04:47,340
A woman?

3875
05:04:47,340 --> 05:04:49,340
Yeah, a bar, a metal bar.

3876
05:04:49,340 --> 05:04:53,340
Some people might have not gotten that if they maybe English is in their first language.

3877
05:04:53,340 --> 05:04:55,340
I prefer the pirate one.

3878
05:04:55,340 --> 05:04:59,340
A pirate walks into an hour.

3879
05:04:59,340 --> 05:05:01,340
How do you not get it?

3880
05:05:01,340 --> 05:05:03,340
Relax, don't be mean.

3881
05:05:03,340 --> 05:05:06,340
Some people don't get it. They're a little bit slower than others.

3882
05:05:07,340 --> 05:05:11,340
Leave the people who are ESL alone.

3883
05:05:11,340 --> 05:05:14,340
They're trying their best out here.

3884
05:05:17,340 --> 05:05:19,340
But yes.

3885
05:05:19,340 --> 05:05:21,340
Hi, Sheedy.

3886
05:05:21,340 --> 05:05:24,340
My name is Sheedy.

3887
05:05:24,340 --> 05:05:27,340
You watch gushing over magical girls.

3888
05:05:27,340 --> 05:05:29,340
If not, you should check it out.

3889
05:05:29,340 --> 05:05:32,340
Love you, you goofy bitch, endearing.

3890
05:05:32,340 --> 05:05:35,340
You goofy bitch.

3891
05:05:36,340 --> 05:05:39,340
I've never heard of gushing over magical girls.

3892
05:05:39,340 --> 05:05:41,340
Maybe I will check it out.

3893
05:05:41,340 --> 05:05:43,340
I'm Adam Sheeby.

3894
05:05:43,340 --> 05:05:45,340
Here's your joke for, wait a second.

3895
05:05:45,340 --> 05:05:48,340
One of you just exposed yourself.

3896
05:05:48,340 --> 05:05:54,340
Oh, interesting.

3897
05:05:54,340 --> 05:05:57,340
This is you, huh?

3898
05:05:57,340 --> 05:05:59,340
Okay.

3899
05:05:59,340 --> 05:06:02,340
Someone.

3900
05:06:02,340 --> 05:06:05,340
Oh, because I recognized a little fate.

3901
05:06:05,340 --> 05:06:07,340
Okay, interesting.

3902
05:06:07,340 --> 05:06:10,340
Because some of you guys write in a very unique style.

3903
05:06:10,340 --> 05:06:14,340
And I like to play a game if I can match the person messaging in my chat.

3904
05:06:14,340 --> 05:06:18,340
He's fucking exposed himself.

3905
05:06:18,340 --> 05:06:21,340
Hi, Madam Sheeby, here's a joke for you.

3906
05:06:21,340 --> 05:06:23,340
A pirate walks to a bar.

3907
05:06:23,340 --> 05:06:25,340
The bartender looks at him quizzically and asks,

3908
05:06:25,340 --> 05:06:29,340
Sir, are you aware that you have a steering wheel attached to your pants?

3909
05:06:29,340 --> 05:06:31,340
The pirate looks at him and responds,

3910
05:06:31,340 --> 05:06:34,340
Oh, and it'd be driving me nuts.

3911
05:06:45,340 --> 05:06:47,340
Everybody really likes that one.

3912
05:06:47,340 --> 05:06:49,340
I guess he nailed it.

3913
05:06:52,340 --> 05:06:55,340
Oh, yeah, you preferred it.

3914
05:06:55,340 --> 05:06:57,340
Sorry, bro.

3915
05:06:57,340 --> 05:07:00,340
Get exposed.

3916
05:07:00,340 --> 05:07:02,340
Madam, I'm thirsty.

3917
05:07:02,340 --> 05:07:04,340
I need fresh supplies to be made.

3918
05:07:04,340 --> 05:07:06,340
It needs to be direct from the source.

3919
05:07:06,340 --> 05:07:08,340
Will you allow me to hydrate myself?

3920
05:07:08,340 --> 05:07:11,340
Will my do my best at making you feel good as well?

3921
05:07:11,340 --> 05:07:13,340
Are you going to also get me a drink?

3922
05:07:13,340 --> 05:07:15,340
That'd be nice.

3923
05:07:15,340 --> 05:07:17,340
PS, I love you for being you.

3924
05:07:17,340 --> 05:07:19,340
You're my Kamiyoshi.

3925
05:07:19,340 --> 05:07:21,340
I'm your fucking co-

3926
05:07:21,340 --> 05:07:23,340
I'm your Kamiyoshi!

3927
05:07:23,340 --> 05:07:25,340
Stop.

3928
05:07:25,340 --> 05:07:27,340
Stop, I don't deserve that.

3929
05:07:27,340 --> 05:07:29,340
I don't even do anything.

3930
05:07:29,340 --> 05:07:31,340
Why do you fucking talk and do silly voices?

3931
05:07:31,340 --> 05:07:33,340
I'm not a singer.

3932
05:07:33,340 --> 05:07:35,340
I'm not doing crazy content.

3933
05:07:35,340 --> 05:07:37,340
I'm not this, I'm not that.

3934
05:07:37,340 --> 05:07:39,340
I don't know why.

3935
05:07:41,340 --> 05:07:43,340
Highlights and shambles now.

3936
05:07:52,340 --> 05:07:55,340
You'll be surprised at how far funny voices can take you.

3937
05:08:00,340 --> 05:08:02,340
Thank you for making every day bearable

3938
05:08:02,340 --> 05:08:04,340
from your tweets and streams alone.

3939
05:08:04,340 --> 05:08:06,340
Bless your heart.

3940
05:08:06,340 --> 05:08:08,340
Is it shiv over?

3941
05:08:08,340 --> 05:08:11,340
Probably we'll make some fresh Ibanez after this stream.

3942
05:08:11,340 --> 05:08:14,340
I'll try to make sure that

3943
05:08:14,340 --> 05:08:17,340
audio doesn't get corrupted when I do that.

3944
05:08:17,340 --> 05:08:20,340
When I sent the tip, I was messing with you.

3945
05:08:20,340 --> 05:08:23,340
I was an attempt to disrespect you and for that, I'm sorry.

3946
05:08:23,340 --> 05:08:26,340
No, this is an attempt to dodge the timeout.

3947
05:08:26,340 --> 05:08:28,340
I had that coming.

3948
05:08:29,340 --> 05:08:31,340
Ah, ah, ah.

3949
05:08:31,340 --> 05:08:33,340
Ah, ah, ah.

3950
05:08:33,340 --> 05:08:36,340
Ah, ah, ah. You picked the wrong time to mess with me, boy.

3951
05:08:36,340 --> 05:08:39,340
You picked the wrong time to mess with me.

3952
05:08:41,340 --> 05:08:43,340
You think when I'm putting you in your place,

3953
05:08:43,340 --> 05:08:45,340
that's the opportunity

3954
05:08:45,340 --> 05:08:47,340
to tip and say,

3955
05:08:47,340 --> 05:08:49,340
no, I'm not gonna do it.

3956
05:08:49,340 --> 05:08:51,340
Remember, I don't, I don't like brats.

3957
05:08:51,340 --> 05:08:53,340
If you're a brat, you're gone.

3958
05:08:53,340 --> 05:08:55,340
I don't want anything to do with you.

3959
05:08:56,340 --> 05:08:58,340
But you apologized.

3960
05:08:58,340 --> 05:09:01,340
You guys are, again, we're getting to know each other.

3961
05:09:01,340 --> 05:09:03,340
You didn't know this about me.

3962
05:09:03,340 --> 05:09:05,340
You didn't know when I switched it on.

3963
05:09:05,340 --> 05:09:07,340
I don't like to be interrupted, although I said in my debut,

3964
05:09:07,340 --> 05:09:09,340
I don't like to be interrupted during playtime.

3965
05:09:09,340 --> 05:09:11,340
Um, you'll be forgiven.

3966
05:09:11,340 --> 05:09:13,340
You're gonna be, you're gonna stay in your timeout.

3967
05:09:13,340 --> 05:09:15,340
And I'm gonna both think about what you've done.

3968
05:09:15,340 --> 05:09:17,340
Okay?

3969
05:09:17,340 --> 05:09:19,340
If you're still lurking,

3970
05:09:20,340 --> 05:09:22,340
your apology is accepted.

3971
05:09:24,340 --> 05:09:26,340
Didn't she say that?

3972
05:09:27,340 --> 05:09:29,340
Anuma's tip, $2.

3973
05:09:29,340 --> 05:09:31,340
Anuma's?

3974
05:09:33,340 --> 05:09:35,340
Oh, great.

3975
05:09:42,340 --> 05:09:44,340
Uh, thank you for the $2.

3976
05:09:44,340 --> 05:09:46,340
Uh, moving on.

3977
05:09:46,340 --> 05:09:49,340
Hi, Madam Sheeby, do you ever wear glasses at all?

3978
05:09:49,340 --> 05:09:51,340
Uh, I'm wearing glasses right now.

3979
05:09:51,340 --> 05:09:53,340
Because I'm fucking blind.

3980
05:09:53,340 --> 05:09:55,340
Or do you find glasses attractive?

3981
05:09:55,340 --> 05:09:58,340
Do you find those people who find glasses, uh, quite attractive?

3982
05:09:58,340 --> 05:10:02,340
I assume because of how the frame and magnify the eyes,

3983
05:10:02,340 --> 05:10:04,340
which I find quite pretty.

3984
05:10:06,340 --> 05:10:09,340
Everybody was just like, eh.

3985
05:10:09,340 --> 05:10:11,340
Uh, no, yeah, I wear glasses.

3986
05:10:11,340 --> 05:10:14,340
Um, most of the time I wear contacts when I'm out and about,

3987
05:10:14,340 --> 05:10:16,340
but I wear them at home.

3988
05:10:16,340 --> 05:10:19,340
Because I just don't feel like sitting here with my eyes drying out.

3989
05:10:19,340 --> 05:10:22,340
And then most of the time I accidentally fall asleep wearing them.

3990
05:10:22,340 --> 05:10:26,340
But with my glasses, I, um, you know, obviously take them off my face.

3991
05:10:29,340 --> 05:10:31,340
It's funny.

3992
05:10:31,340 --> 05:10:35,340
Because I used to complain about not being able to see

3993
05:10:35,340 --> 05:10:38,340
even sitting in the front row at like school.

3994
05:10:38,340 --> 05:10:40,340
My mom like just like never believed me.

3995
05:10:40,340 --> 05:10:42,340
And then they finally took me to the eye doctor and they're like,

3996
05:10:42,340 --> 05:10:45,340
oh yeah, her vision, not good.

3997
05:10:45,340 --> 05:10:49,340
And it's like, I don't even, like my parents have like 20, 20 vision.

3998
05:10:49,340 --> 05:10:52,340
Not a lot of people wear glasses in my family.

3999
05:10:52,340 --> 05:10:54,340
They're getting older now, so they have to wear readers,

4000
05:10:54,340 --> 05:10:59,340
but like, I think like only like my uncle and my dad's side has to wear glasses.

4001
05:10:59,340 --> 05:11:01,340
And I'm like, what the hell?

4002
05:11:01,340 --> 05:11:04,340
Mom? Is there something you need to tell me? No, I'm kidding.

4003
05:11:04,340 --> 05:11:07,340
If you saw me and my dad, you'd be like, oh, that's copy paste.

4004
05:11:07,340 --> 05:11:09,340
Uh, she just has titties.

4005
05:11:09,340 --> 05:11:11,340
Um, and is a woman and I'm cute.

4006
05:11:11,340 --> 05:11:13,340
I don't look like a man, I promise.

4007
05:11:14,340 --> 05:11:17,340
Um, how much grade do you use?

4008
05:11:17,340 --> 05:11:19,340
It's not that bad.

4009
05:11:19,340 --> 05:11:24,340
I'm like, hold on, I have to remember.

4010
05:11:24,340 --> 05:11:27,340
Fuck, what is my prescription?

4011
05:11:27,340 --> 05:11:38,340
I'm like negative 0.25 in one eye and then 0.2 in the other or 0.3 in one eye

4012
05:11:38,340 --> 05:11:40,340
and 0.3, 0.5 in the other.

4013
05:11:40,340 --> 05:11:43,340
So like, I'm not going to lie to you.

4014
05:11:43,340 --> 05:11:46,340
I used to have a really, like when I was younger,

4015
05:11:46,340 --> 05:11:48,340
I was born with fucking googly eyes.

4016
05:11:48,340 --> 05:11:52,340
My dad used to call me like, call me fucking googly eyes, essentially,

4017
05:11:52,340 --> 05:11:54,340
because I had a really bad lazy eye and moved to the side.

4018
05:11:54,340 --> 05:11:56,340
I don't wear patches, kid.

4019
05:11:56,340 --> 05:11:58,340
So I was a pirate.

4020
05:11:58,340 --> 05:12:03,340
Um, it was corrected, but I can control it now.

4021
05:12:03,340 --> 05:12:08,340
So I can make my eye go like really, uh, really fucking like lazy.

4022
05:12:08,340 --> 05:12:11,340
And be like, hey, and then I always do that to people.

4023
05:12:11,340 --> 05:12:13,340
Like I would do that to my coworkers in the middle of talking to them

4024
05:12:13,340 --> 05:12:17,340
and they'd like freak out because my eye just like slowly drips away.

4025
05:12:20,340 --> 05:12:24,340
Um, but my mom, my mom's, my mom's just like, oh yeah,

4026
05:12:24,340 --> 05:12:28,340
you fucking hated the iPad, you would take it off and stick to the TV.

4027
05:12:28,340 --> 05:12:31,340
And then you just keep watching TV.

4028
05:12:31,340 --> 05:12:35,340
But then she's like, it didn't make sense because then you couldn't see past the sticker

4029
05:12:35,340 --> 05:12:38,340
and you would complain you couldn't see with it all.

4030
05:12:38,340 --> 05:12:40,340
Oh my God.

4031
05:12:40,340 --> 05:12:42,340
I don't have to tell you, mom.

4032
05:12:42,340 --> 05:12:44,340
Lazy Susan type beat.

4033
05:12:44,340 --> 05:12:48,340
Um, just sort of wore a second eye patch under the first one.

4034
05:12:48,340 --> 05:12:53,340
Um, yeah, that was like when I was like, like five or six or seven though,

4035
05:12:53,340 --> 05:12:54,340
I can't remember.

4036
05:12:54,340 --> 05:12:57,340
I don't, I like, I generally don't even remember wearing one.

4037
05:12:57,340 --> 05:12:59,340
It was only like, I only know that I had one from like pictures

4038
05:12:59,340 --> 05:13:00,340
of when I was super young.

4039
05:13:00,340 --> 05:13:02,340
I'm like, I don't even remember that.

4040
05:13:03,340 --> 05:13:07,340
Um, no, but it wasn't even, it wasn't an eye patch.

4041
05:13:07,340 --> 05:13:12,340
It was like a little sticker you literally go over your eye with.

4042
05:13:12,340 --> 05:13:15,340
Like it's like a little, like it's just a giant fucking sticker for your face.

4043
05:13:15,340 --> 05:13:17,340
And you just smack it on.

4044
05:13:17,340 --> 05:13:21,340
It's not like, so there could have been a second mercy.

4045
05:13:21,340 --> 05:13:24,340
Um, I actually did do that thing.

4046
05:13:24,340 --> 05:13:28,340
I would actually cover my eye a lot so I could see in the dark.

4047
05:13:29,340 --> 05:13:32,340
I would, uh, I would do that.

4048
05:13:32,340 --> 05:13:34,340
I would a hundred percent do that.

4049
05:13:34,340 --> 05:13:36,340
I was such a fucking shooting kid.

4050
05:13:36,340 --> 05:13:40,340
You have no fucking idea doing Naruto hand signs running around like,

4051
05:13:40,340 --> 05:13:41,340
like a fucking ninja.

4052
05:13:41,340 --> 05:13:45,340
I was so, I'm surprised.

4053
05:13:45,340 --> 05:13:48,340
My parents didn't get me locked up with how delusional I was.

4054
05:13:48,340 --> 05:13:49,340
She be demon.

4055
05:13:49,340 --> 05:13:51,340
I, yeah, it was my, that was my demon.

4056
05:13:51,340 --> 05:13:52,340
I'm my lazy.

4057
05:13:52,340 --> 05:13:53,340
I was my demon.

4058
05:13:53,340 --> 05:13:57,340
I, I can't even, I can't even remember which one is like, was my lazy.

4059
05:13:57,340 --> 05:14:03,340
I think it's the one that was, that has a higher, um, or technically a lower,

4060
05:14:03,340 --> 05:14:05,340
like prescription or whatever.

4061
05:14:05,340 --> 05:14:06,340
Our prescription.

4062
05:14:09,340 --> 05:14:10,340
Believe it.

4063
05:14:11,340 --> 05:14:14,340
Can we get some of the Chuni back now?

4064
05:14:14,340 --> 05:14:15,340
You got mercy for that.

4065
05:14:15,340 --> 05:14:16,340
She's a Chuni.

4066
05:14:17,340 --> 05:14:18,340
I'm no longer a Chuni.

4067
05:14:18,340 --> 05:14:19,340
I'm such a fucking normie now.

4068
05:14:19,340 --> 05:14:26,340
Like, uh, I used to be the hugest weeb in Korea boo.

4069
05:14:26,340 --> 05:14:29,340
Um, I was a weeaboo and a Korea boo in the worst way.

4070
05:14:29,340 --> 05:14:30,340
I was singing in Japanese.

4071
05:14:30,340 --> 05:14:32,340
I mean, my friend would talk to each other in Japanese.

4072
05:14:32,340 --> 05:14:34,340
I actually knew a lot of Japanese.

4073
05:14:34,340 --> 05:14:37,340
Uh, my Japanese name was like Mitsuko word of the fuck.

4074
05:14:37,340 --> 05:14:40,340
Um, we refer to that.

4075
05:14:40,340 --> 05:14:42,340
We would pass notes in Japanese.

4076
05:14:42,340 --> 05:14:48,340
Um, we would pretend we were, uh, anime characters all the time.

4077
05:14:48,340 --> 05:14:51,340
Uh, we talk in those stupid ass voices.

4078
05:14:51,340 --> 05:14:54,340
Like, oh my God.

4079
05:14:55,340 --> 05:14:58,340
So you discovered my secret power.

4080
05:15:00,340 --> 05:15:02,340
She has no idea what's going to hit her.

4081
05:15:02,340 --> 05:15:03,340
Ah.

4082
05:15:09,340 --> 05:15:11,340
Should be got a real job.

4083
05:15:11,340 --> 05:15:12,340
I know.

4084
05:15:12,340 --> 05:15:13,340
Yeah.

4085
05:15:13,340 --> 05:15:14,340
I know.

4086
05:15:14,340 --> 05:15:17,340
I really, I actually, like my job, like actually spoke Japanese pretty well.

4087
05:15:17,340 --> 05:15:25,340
And, um, I can actually, I'm very good at picking up on like accent and how to say something.

4088
05:15:25,340 --> 05:15:31,340
Um, I have a lot of, uh, Chinese customers and they would teach me Mandarin.

4089
05:15:31,340 --> 05:15:36,340
Some of them would teach me Cantonese and they would like say a word and I would just repeat it to them.

4090
05:15:36,340 --> 05:15:38,340
And they're like, Hey, that was actually pretty good.

4091
05:15:38,340 --> 05:15:40,340
I'm like, yay.

4092
05:15:40,340 --> 05:15:46,340
Oh, you need to be, um, yeah.

4093
05:15:46,340 --> 05:15:47,340
Yeah.

4094
05:15:47,340 --> 05:15:48,340
Oh, she was great.

4095
05:15:48,340 --> 05:15:49,340
I missed her.

4096
05:15:49,340 --> 05:15:50,340
I haven't seen her in years.

4097
05:15:50,340 --> 05:15:54,340
Uh, I remember I tried reaching out to her, but it just like got no word back.

4098
05:15:54,340 --> 05:15:57,340
Like, you know, like people just go to college and they drift away.

4099
05:15:57,340 --> 05:15:59,340
Like that's, that's just kind of what happened.

4100
05:15:59,340 --> 05:16:02,340
Um, but I bet she's, I bet she's like prospering out there somewhere.

4101
05:16:02,340 --> 05:16:05,340
She was, she was a really talented artist.

4102
05:16:05,340 --> 05:16:09,340
I'll tell you that she was, she's probably like some fucking big animator right now.

4103
05:16:09,340 --> 05:16:11,340
I would not be surprised.

4104
05:16:11,340 --> 05:16:14,340
Um, super fucking talented.

4105
05:16:14,340 --> 05:16:15,340
Redacted.

4106
05:16:15,340 --> 05:16:20,340
If you're watching this, I miss you.

4107
05:16:20,340 --> 05:16:24,340
You know, you are.

4108
05:16:24,340 --> 05:16:31,340
Kiri and Muda forever.

4109
05:16:31,340 --> 05:16:36,340
She be Chunibom.

4110
05:16:36,340 --> 05:16:39,340
You know, there's me who goes through a friend every month for not really figuring out who

4111
05:16:39,340 --> 05:16:40,340
I vibe with.

4112
05:16:40,340 --> 05:16:43,340
Um, honestly, I would.

4113
05:16:44,340 --> 05:16:47,340
I imagine she's just, that'd be crazy.

4114
05:16:47,340 --> 05:16:51,340
Uh, no, they do not have the same art style because she has a very distinct art style.

4115
05:16:51,340 --> 05:16:58,340
Um, uh, that, I feel like that has to do more with you than it actually has to do with

4116
05:16:58,340 --> 05:17:00,340
the people that you're hanging out with.

4117
05:17:00,340 --> 05:17:06,340
Um, because you have to, you don't want to be friends with the saint.

4118
05:17:06,340 --> 05:17:08,340
Like, because my friends are totally different from me.

4119
05:17:08,340 --> 05:17:10,340
Totally different.

4120
05:17:10,340 --> 05:17:12,340
Um, hello.

4121
05:17:12,340 --> 05:17:13,340
Welcome back.

4122
05:17:13,340 --> 05:17:17,340
Um, she was a tough over.

4123
05:17:17,340 --> 05:17:21,340
Um, give people a chance.

4124
05:17:21,340 --> 05:17:23,340
Make sure you get to know them.

4125
05:17:23,340 --> 05:17:26,340
Uh, you don't make friendships in a month.

4126
05:17:26,340 --> 05:17:30,340
And sometimes you just have the personality traits of just like kind of just being an introvert

4127
05:17:30,340 --> 05:17:31,340
and that's okay.

4128
05:17:31,340 --> 05:17:32,340
You can have acquaintances.

4129
05:17:32,340 --> 05:17:35,340
You don't have to be friends with people, you know.

4130
05:17:35,340 --> 05:17:36,340
Yeah.

4131
05:17:36,340 --> 05:17:37,340
I could change your group.

4132
05:17:37,340 --> 05:17:38,340
Yeah.

4133
05:17:38,340 --> 05:17:39,340
Yeah.

4134
05:17:39,340 --> 05:17:40,340
No, thank you.

4135
05:17:40,340 --> 05:17:44,340
Um, different races, different backgrounds, different cultures, uh, different levels of

4136
05:17:44,340 --> 05:17:45,340
baseness.

4137
05:17:45,340 --> 05:17:47,340
You got me in the middle.

4138
05:17:47,340 --> 05:17:51,340
You got olive at the beginning and you got Salem way.

4139
05:17:51,340 --> 05:17:55,340
Fucking bass is fuck.

4140
05:17:55,340 --> 05:18:01,340
Um, and then like I have other friends who are like married.

4141
05:18:01,340 --> 05:18:02,340
I have friends who have like kids.

4142
05:18:02,340 --> 05:18:06,340
I have friends like, so it's like, it's so good to surround yourself with people that

4143
05:18:06,340 --> 05:18:10,340
are so much different from you because you will learn so much from them.

4144
05:18:10,340 --> 05:18:18,340
Yeah, you don't have to be like, I like, I would say olive and Salem, um, are my best

4145
05:18:18,340 --> 05:18:22,340
friends and I would die for them.

4146
05:18:22,340 --> 05:18:27,340
And then I have like friends from work where they're like, I'm not going to like go out

4147
05:18:27,340 --> 05:18:28,340
of my way to hang out with you.

4148
05:18:28,340 --> 05:18:34,340
I'm not going to like, if you can, if you have some fucking car trouble, come and pick you

4149
05:18:34,340 --> 05:18:36,340
up because that's like the good thing to do.

4150
05:18:36,340 --> 05:18:44,340
Um, but like, I don't really want to hear about how some dude broke up with you and you're

4151
05:18:44,340 --> 05:18:48,340
just like, because again, I'm so fucking nice and people just tell me their entire life

4152
05:18:48,340 --> 05:18:53,340
stories and I just have to like compartmentalize that and took it behind me and just be like,

4153
05:18:53,340 --> 05:18:54,340
yeah, okay.

4154
05:18:54,340 --> 05:18:56,340
And then I just moved on with my life.

4155
05:18:56,340 --> 05:18:58,340
It was a pony roll point.

4156
05:18:58,340 --> 05:19:01,340
What an RP group that lasted four years.

4157
05:19:01,340 --> 05:19:04,340
Hey, man, I was in a lot of RP groups.

4158
05:19:04,340 --> 05:19:06,340
I was in both RP groups.

4159
05:19:06,340 --> 05:19:08,340
So don't even get me started.

4160
05:19:08,340 --> 05:19:11,340
Oh, wiki foundry and wet paint forever.

4161
05:19:11,340 --> 05:19:13,340
Black bloods, black bloods.

4162
05:19:13,340 --> 05:19:14,340
Sorry.

4163
05:19:14,340 --> 05:19:16,340
Black bloods back.

4164
05:19:16,340 --> 05:19:17,340
That's back.

4165
05:19:17,340 --> 05:19:25,340
Um, Sasuke Itachi, itachi can't get heartbroken if you've never dated.

4166
05:19:25,340 --> 05:19:27,340
Oh, sweetheart.

4167
05:19:27,340 --> 05:19:29,340
Oh, sweetheart.

4168
05:19:29,340 --> 05:19:31,340
I'll be honest with you.

4169
05:19:31,340 --> 05:19:33,340
Girls are very fucking brutal.

4170
05:19:33,340 --> 05:19:43,340
Uh, and then confidence is a thing like you have to, you know, work on your own like self-love

4171
05:19:43,340 --> 05:19:44,340
and all that stuff.

4172
05:19:44,340 --> 05:19:49,340
Because sometimes you feel like you're unlovable because you don't love yourself yet, you know.

4173
05:19:49,340 --> 05:19:54,340
Uh, and yeah, you can get heartbroken even if you never dated.

4174
05:19:54,340 --> 05:19:55,340
You're right.

4175
05:19:55,340 --> 05:19:58,340
I've gotten heartbroken after fucking anime characters.

4176
05:19:58,340 --> 05:20:06,340
I've gotten heartbroken over, you know, having a like a whiplash for a Vtuber.

4177
05:20:06,340 --> 05:20:07,340
I watched.

4178
05:20:07,340 --> 05:20:08,340
I totally get that.

4179
05:20:08,340 --> 05:20:09,340
I get it.

4180
05:20:09,340 --> 05:20:10,340
I get it.

4181
05:20:10,340 --> 05:20:12,340
I've never been rejected.

4182
05:20:12,340 --> 05:20:16,340
Uh, I would go out of my way to get rejected.

4183
05:20:16,340 --> 05:20:17,340
I don't mean to like guys or whatever.

4184
05:20:17,340 --> 05:20:19,340
I mean, just like in general, like, hey, can I have this job?

4185
05:20:19,340 --> 05:20:20,340
Can I do this?

4186
05:20:20,340 --> 05:20:26,340
Because when you get rejected so often, you become used to it.

4187
05:20:26,340 --> 05:20:31,340
And, um, it doesn't scare you as much to me.

4188
05:20:31,340 --> 05:20:35,340
Like you realize you can survive after being rejected.

4189
05:20:35,340 --> 05:20:44,340
I also, again, I grew up a very religious conservative girl.

4190
05:20:44,340 --> 05:20:51,340
If I looked at a boy, I thought I was going to fucking go to hell.

4191
05:20:51,340 --> 05:20:53,340
I remember I got some heartbroken one time.

4192
05:20:53,340 --> 05:20:54,340
I was physically ill.

4193
05:20:54,340 --> 05:20:56,340
Oh, you sweet thing.

4194
05:20:56,340 --> 05:20:57,340
You're helping with confidence.

4195
05:20:57,340 --> 05:20:58,340
You know, she'd be, I'm glad.

4196
05:20:58,340 --> 05:21:01,340
I'm glad I can help you guys with confidence.

4197
05:21:01,340 --> 05:21:05,340
I like, again, I remember some of the messages you guys sent me.

4198
05:21:05,340 --> 05:21:11,340
You're like, oh, I really liked your aftercare and your ASMR role play.

4199
05:21:11,340 --> 05:21:15,340
It really actually, like I talk to myself and I say good things about myself in the mirror.

4200
05:21:15,340 --> 05:21:17,340
I'm trying to eat better and go to the gym.

4201
05:21:17,340 --> 05:21:25,340
Um, yeah, it all, first, um, it all starts with, uh, your mindset and, you know, kind

4202
05:21:25,340 --> 05:21:26,340
of learning with yourself.

4203
05:21:26,340 --> 05:21:30,340
So, okay, I'm going to be, I'm going to be really weird with you for a second.

4204
05:21:30,340 --> 05:21:32,340
You don't have to do this, by the way.

4205
05:21:32,340 --> 05:21:38,340
It's just like what I found was good for me in a good tool, uh, one therapy, but two.

4206
05:21:38,340 --> 05:21:46,340
Um, so there is something in like the witchy community and it's called, uh, your shadow

4207
05:21:46,340 --> 05:21:47,340
self.

4208
05:21:47,340 --> 05:21:52,340
And that's the self that you kind of push down and it's like, you know, hidden in the

4209
05:21:52,340 --> 05:21:53,340
shadows, so to speak.

4210
05:21:53,340 --> 05:21:56,340
And you don't really like to acknowledge it.

4211
05:21:56,340 --> 05:22:04,340
And how you do, like, you can look up like shadow journaling and it kind of gives you

4212
05:22:04,340 --> 05:22:09,340
a prompt where you have to kind of confront that shadowy aspect of yourself.

4213
05:22:09,340 --> 05:22:15,340
Um, because I remember I had like a really toxic friend and she was like a horrible

4214
05:22:15,340 --> 05:22:21,340
even being to me and I just did not have the power to tell her like I can't be friends

4215
05:22:21,340 --> 05:22:24,340
with you because I was such a pushover at the time.

4216
05:22:24,340 --> 05:22:28,340
So I sat down with myself and I'm like, what am I getting out of this relationship?

4217
05:22:28,340 --> 05:22:34,340
What am I, I'm not gaining anything from being friends with this person who just pushes me

4218
05:22:34,340 --> 05:22:39,340
around, uses me only for like when I have money and she wants me to buy or something.

4219
05:22:39,340 --> 05:22:42,340
Like what the.

4220
05:22:42,340 --> 05:22:49,340
And then just like blows me off for her other friends and then talk shit behind my back.

4221
05:22:49,340 --> 05:22:53,340
Like what are you going to know?

4222
05:22:53,340 --> 05:22:59,340
And then I was just, I came down to I'm like, I didn't like myself.

4223
05:22:59,340 --> 05:23:06,340
That's the shadow part was I didn't like who I was and I thought that I deserved that

4224
05:23:06,340 --> 05:23:11,340
sort of treatment, but you have to realize you don't.

4225
05:23:11,340 --> 05:23:12,340
Yeah, shadow work.

4226
05:23:12,340 --> 05:23:13,340
Yeah.

4227
05:23:13,340 --> 05:23:14,340
You guys know what shadow work?

4228
05:23:14,340 --> 05:23:15,340
Yeah, shadow.

4229
05:23:15,340 --> 05:23:16,340
I fought my demons.

4230
05:23:16,340 --> 05:23:19,340
I shadow box my demons.

4231
05:23:19,340 --> 05:23:24,340
I on it like and that's and you don't have to put it in that frame of like, oh, which

4232
05:23:24,340 --> 05:23:29,340
you should like honestly shadow work is very similar to like normal as someone who like

4233
05:23:29,340 --> 05:23:35,340
I actively go to therapy who just journaling in general, such a good outlet.

4234
05:23:35,340 --> 05:23:40,340
So I always say work on your mental and then find a hobby that is a good outlet for you.

4235
05:23:40,340 --> 05:23:42,340
That's going for the gym, go to the gym for me.

4236
05:23:42,340 --> 05:23:43,340
I was doing jiu-jitsu.

4237
05:23:43,340 --> 05:23:46,340
I'm currently not able to do that right now because of my injuries.

4238
05:23:46,340 --> 05:23:50,580
So it became video games for a little bit and then it became vTubing vTubing is such

4239
05:23:50,580 --> 05:23:51,580
a good outlet for me.

4240
05:23:51,580 --> 05:23:52,940
I can rage at video games.

4241
05:23:52,940 --> 05:23:54,260
I can talk to you guys.

4242
05:23:54,260 --> 05:23:57,780
I can do fun stuff on my own.

4243
05:23:57,780 --> 05:24:00,340
So it's it's good and I can make my friends.

4244
05:24:00,340 --> 05:24:01,340
It's a great outlet for me.

4245
05:24:01,340 --> 05:24:02,340
It's a great hobby.

4246
05:24:02,340 --> 05:24:06,700
Um, I also I'm currently working on trying to get a more active hobby now that it's nice

4247
05:24:06,700 --> 05:24:08,980
and sunny outside and all that shit.

4248
05:24:08,980 --> 05:24:14,980
So I'm going to try to go like hiking again and whatever, um, very Jungian concept.

4249
05:24:14,980 --> 05:24:15,980
Yeah.

4250
05:24:15,980 --> 05:24:16,980
That's kind of true actually.

4251
05:24:16,980 --> 05:24:18,980
Jordan Pierce in shorts.

4252
05:24:18,980 --> 05:24:23,740
Um, and yeah, it is cathartic.

4253
05:24:23,740 --> 05:24:28,780
It's literally like this is almost like therapy for me because like I talked to you guys how

4254
05:24:28,780 --> 05:24:32,820
I talk to my therapist sometimes just in the frame of like, Oh, this is how I'm feeling

4255
05:24:32,820 --> 05:24:33,820
this week.

4256
05:24:33,820 --> 05:24:37,020
Um, I've been stressed out.

4257
05:24:37,020 --> 05:24:41,100
Like I was telling my therapist, like all these eyes are on me.

4258
05:24:41,100 --> 05:24:46,100
I don't feel like I'm like we're currently we're working through my posture syndrome.

4259
05:24:46,100 --> 05:24:50,700
Um, but she's on a vacation for two weeks in Europe and I don't know what, but so you

4260
05:24:50,700 --> 05:24:51,780
guys are my therapist.

4261
05:24:51,780 --> 05:24:52,780
I'm sorry.

4262
05:24:52,780 --> 05:24:53,780
Sorry guys.

4263
05:24:53,780 --> 05:24:56,780
I'm going to cry to you instead.

4264
05:24:56,780 --> 05:25:05,740
Um, yeah, we can tell as I can't tell what the context of that was, um, don't take your

4265
05:25:05,740 --> 05:25:06,740
meds.

4266
05:25:06,740 --> 05:25:10,900
Dude, no, uh, if I didn't take my meds, I would never leave my house.

4267
05:25:10,900 --> 05:25:12,500
It's not fun being a gorophobic man.

4268
05:25:12,500 --> 05:25:13,500
It's really not.

4269
05:25:13,500 --> 05:25:14,980
I don't recommend it.

4270
05:25:14,980 --> 05:25:19,220
I only get bad advice.

4271
05:25:19,220 --> 05:25:21,220
Give us your tears.

4272
05:25:21,220 --> 05:25:28,980
Um, collective shoulders can hold a lot of tears teasing material for later.

4273
05:25:28,980 --> 05:25:32,940
She is a therapist and takes her meds like a good girl.

4274
05:25:32,940 --> 05:25:38,380
Um, no, it's cause I'm a fucking adult and I am not self-destructive.

4275
05:25:38,380 --> 05:25:39,380
That is teenager.

4276
05:25:39,380 --> 05:25:40,380

Uh, yeah, I have like, don't, don't get it twisted.

4279
05:25:50,980 --> 05:26:00,380
I have my Manhattan moments, um, but I almost do like act upon my more Manhattan moments

4280
05:26:00,380 --> 05:26:04,900
because I know I'm in a like safe space in the community where it's expected for that

4281
05:26:04,900 --> 05:26:05,900
to open up.

4282
05:26:05,900 --> 05:26:06,900
She's being a woman.

4283
05:26:06,900 --> 05:26:07,900
Uh, whatever.

4284
05:26:07,900 --> 05:26:10,740
But like, I haven't even really had that yet.

4285
05:26:10,740 --> 05:26:16,500
I'm like, because of, I've thought of like, I like had like a negative thought the other

4286
05:26:16,500 --> 05:26:17,500
day about streaming.

4287
05:26:17,500 --> 05:26:20,620
I don't even remember what it was, but I'm like, normally I would like vent about this

4288
05:26:20,620 --> 05:26:21,620
on my all.

4289
05:26:21,620 --> 05:26:26,100
And I'm like, I don't have to do that.

4290
05:26:26,100 --> 05:26:27,860
I don't have to do that.

4291
05:26:28,780 --> 05:26:30,380
Yes.

4292
05:26:30,380 --> 05:26:31,380

What is Manhattan?

4302
05:26:51,140 --> 05:26:56,940
Uh, Manhattan is a Japanese, uh, close deal term, uh, in the v-tubeing community for essentially

4303
05:26:56,940 --> 05:27:02,700
crazy person or someone who kind of like acts out a lot it doesn't have like any impulse control

4304
05:27:04,540 --> 05:27:12,300
kind of just like breaks down and kind of like loses it often like for example if i like imagine

4305
05:27:12,300 --> 05:27:19,020
if i instead of having like this productive talk with you i went on on my all and i cried

the five kids they can raise them on my streams exactly the safer work ones of course

4419
05:40:47,980 --> 05:40:55,900
oh my god we're gonna be a cute little amish family guys i'm making a commune in a cult

we're gonna be the second jones town i'm kidding i'm kidding i'm kidding i'm kidding

4421
05:41:02,620 --> 05:41:06,220

4422
05:41:08,460 --> 05:41:11,740
i am quite the endurance streamer aren't i um

4423
05:41:18,700 --> 05:41:23,260
i've never watched vtubers before but i clicked on one of your streams out of curiosity

4424
05:41:23,260 --> 05:41:27,500
and now i'm lurking in all your streams i'm quite shy so i don't chat much during live streams

4425
05:41:27,500 --> 05:41:32,780
but i wanted to say i really enjoy your content um i'll pause there there's a lot more thank you

4426
05:41:32,780 --> 05:41:37,660
if you lurk thank you you don't have to talk in my streams if you don't feel comfortable

4427
05:41:37,660 --> 05:41:43,900
i appreciate uh that you just like want to hang out watch me listen to me maybe have me in the

4428
05:41:43,900 --> 05:41:51,260
background i love my lurkers lurkers are amazing um it's also hectic if like a hundred people talking

4429
05:41:51,260 --> 05:41:59,980
chat but yeah uh but welcome welcome to vtubers uh it's quite a wild ride but it's really cool

4430
05:41:59,980 --> 05:42:05,740
and fun you'll soon discover uh i like how blunt and honest you are it makes you feel like more

4431
05:42:05,740 --> 05:42:09,820
of a person than most of the other vtubers i've heard of i've been going through a rough patch

4432
05:42:09,820 --> 05:42:14,780
lately and your streams have been helping i'm afraid i'm becoming parasocial oh i don't know

4433
05:42:14,780 --> 05:42:19,500
if this is a bad thing or not all i know is that's generally not advice do you have any advice how to

4434
05:42:19,500 --> 05:42:25,020
prevent this if not then that's fine thanks for being chill the chillimeters app off the charts um

4435
05:42:27,660 --> 05:42:33,180
i can't really stop you for being parasocial um

4436
05:42:34,060 --> 05:42:34,560
um

4437
05:42:36,460 --> 05:42:37,820
you have to understand

4438
05:42:40,140 --> 05:42:47,420
that i'm trying to say this nicely it's gonna i think most people are pretty understanding

4439
05:42:47,420 --> 05:42:52,940
that like i'm probably i'm never gonna meet you in person um we're never gonna hang out together

4440
05:42:54,140 --> 05:43:02,780
um and i'm sorry that's not a possibility but it's for everybody's safety um and mental

4441
05:43:02,780 --> 05:43:10,540
well-being so nobody gets hurt uh i totally understand i've also been parasocial with

4442
05:43:10,540 --> 05:43:19,740
streamers before flesh tubers and vtubers alike uh i used to have dreams that pewdiepie

4443
05:43:20,460 --> 05:43:28,860
actually knew me and gave me a shout out on his main channel and i'll have continuances of dreams

4444
05:43:28,860 --> 05:43:37,820
where i run into him again um and in my dream i'm just like he's like and i'm like an old friend of

4445
05:43:37,820 --> 05:43:44,700
his i've never fucking met the dude i've never talked to him i don't even know i had those dreams

4446
05:43:47,340 --> 05:43:53,260
i haven't watched pewdiepie in years but like sometimes one of those will just pop up and i'm

4447
05:43:53,260 --> 05:43:56,940
just like what the fuck because i really liked him as a creator i would watch him when i came home

4448
05:43:56,940 --> 05:44:03,100
from school at the time so i get it uh pewds got me through a lot of shit in markiplier,

4449
05:44:03,100 --> 05:44:08,300
jacksepticeye and like game grumps and fucking van os's crew and all that shit i watched a lot

4450
05:44:09,180 --> 05:44:17,500
of youtube growing up because i didn't have any fucking friends so i get it it's hard not to develop

4451
05:44:17,500 --> 05:44:22,940
friendship feelings or otherwise what the people you watch especially if you really enjoy their

4452
05:44:22,940 --> 05:44:31,100
personality um i always said my goal was to be a content creator that you felt like you could come

4453
05:44:31,100 --> 05:44:39,260
home to and sit down and watch and like just kind of unwind after a long day and like you're hanging

4454
05:44:39,260 --> 05:44:43,580
out with an old friend playing video games and chatting with them that was kind of my goal um

4455
05:44:46,460 --> 05:44:50,380
but like i know that's probably really a little bit problematic now given like

4456
05:44:50,380 --> 05:44:55,660
vtubers are kind of again a little bit more parasocial because you can't see me it's hard to

4457
05:44:55,660 --> 05:44:59,900
remember them a human being sometimes and you know i can't really blame you for that uh

4458
05:45:01,100 --> 05:45:05,420
at all actually like i totally get it like i sometimes will watch a streamer and i'm like

4459
05:45:05,420 --> 05:45:13,180
yes they are this type of cat girl yes totally like you get caught up on it i can't blame you

4460
05:45:13,580 --> 05:45:16,460
can you be parasocial with your cats that's fine

4461
05:45:19,020 --> 05:45:23,580
bro if i were able to sample any of richie b s*** for my rap music that'd be phenomenal

4462
05:45:24,140 --> 05:45:28,620
this talking spectacularly because how much it relates to that very similarity for other streamers

4463
05:45:28,620 --> 05:45:38,620
yeah honestly i give you permission for that um i has cupcake yeah ld shadow lady oh my god yeah

4464
05:45:39,340 --> 05:45:45,340
100% like i watched markiplier um the most right and actually no game grumps i watched the most

4465
05:45:45,900 --> 05:45:52,460
and i literally if i'm i'll have him in the background and i feel like i have like two of

4466
05:45:52,460 --> 05:46:00,220
my older brothers hanging out with me uh playing f***ing resident evil giggling over lady dibertresque

4467
05:46:00,220 --> 05:46:05,980
and i'm just giggling while i'm cleaning my room cleaning the house doing this putting on my makeup

4468
05:46:05,980 --> 05:46:14,140
and it's like i get it i totally get it um but then you at the end of the day you have to remember

4469
05:46:15,820 --> 05:46:19,100
watch real what's not but i feel like a lot of my viewers are pretty

4470
05:46:21,660 --> 05:46:27,980
uh like they kind of are self-aware and they're like oh my god i'm falling in love with her

4471
05:46:28,940 --> 05:46:36,140
that's fine well like i don't want to hurt you i'll hurt you physically like

4472
05:46:38,540 --> 05:46:43,420
you know like i don't want to oh my god i'm literally tearing up because like i don't want to

4473
05:46:43,420 --> 05:46:49,900
break anybody's heart i don't want to break anybody's f***ing heart man

4474
05:46:58,700 --> 05:47:04,860
because it sucks having your heart broken because you can't be with someone so i f***ing get it

4475
05:47:04,860 --> 05:47:12,540
like i'm not gonna discourage it but

4476
05:47:19,900 --> 05:47:32,700
i don't really yeah i don't know what else to say like i can't stop you i can't

4477
05:47:35,180 --> 05:47:46,300
yeah it's an inevitable if i discourage or not

4478
05:47:49,500 --> 05:47:55,820
but i almost don't want to like i can't i don't really discourage it because like

4479
05:47:55,900 --> 05:47:57,740
there is

4480
05:48:00,300 --> 05:48:03,820
i i kind of think that like being parasocial is a spectrum

4481
05:48:05,260 --> 05:48:10,620
you have people in one end that are like this is a cool streamer i watch and then you have other

4482
05:48:10,620 --> 05:48:18,380
people get it and they're like i am actually married to them um and i just want to be in the

4483
05:48:18,380 --> 05:48:24,620
middle where you're i'm a streamer you watch you like and you can enjoy me but you just understand

4484
05:48:26,780 --> 05:48:27,180
you know

4485
05:48:29,420 --> 05:48:34,620
like you just be realistic and it sucks because like i'm a major f***ing people pleaser

4486
05:48:35,580 --> 05:48:39,580
and i want to make you all happy i don't want to break people's heart

4487
05:48:43,340 --> 05:48:49,420
um but i can't tell you not to love me i can't tell you not to like want to be my friend because

4488
05:48:49,420 --> 05:48:56,460
i understand it i watch so many female vtubers and i'm like oh my god i wish i could be their friend

4489
05:48:57,660 --> 05:49:02,860
it sucks because i know when i'll ever be even being a streamer now like i'm like i'll never be

4490
05:49:02,860 --> 05:49:10,060
their friend you know even it sucks i love you too much for the middle

4491
05:49:13,020 --> 05:49:15,900
i'm not even in this for the hornet i just want to watch someone who isn't restricting what they

4492
05:49:15,900 --> 05:49:20,780
say or do that's fine too um

4493
05:49:23,420 --> 05:49:30,780
yeah that's me though i know like emi and isi are f***ing hella parasocial with you guys

4494
05:49:30,780 --> 05:49:36,140
oh my god they f***ing love you guys you'd have no idea and mercy too oh my god

4495
05:49:37,580 --> 05:49:43,260
is there a little bit she's like a little bit laid back about it though um isi's in love with

4496
05:49:43,260 --> 05:49:49,820
y'all if you're gonna f***ing hunt you down parasocial responsibility kids yeah exactly

4497
05:49:51,020 --> 05:49:54,220
i just don't want anybody to get like hurt over me you know

4498
05:50:00,140 --> 05:50:09,260
and i think that's kind of also what it's like being a dom because when you're a dominatrix

4499
05:50:09,260 --> 05:50:14,700
and you have clients and they come in and they ask for they have certain requests

4500
05:50:15,580 --> 05:50:18,780
and you fulfill those requests at the end of the day

4501
05:50:22,540 --> 05:50:29,260
it's a different type of relationship and that's the relationship i want to have with you i want

4502
05:50:29,260 --> 05:50:34,700
you to feel safe with me i want you to feel you know protected with me i want you to feel like

4503
05:50:34,700 --> 05:50:40,940
you can go fulfill fantasies with me and if some of those fantasies have to do with be with you loving

4504
05:50:40,940 --> 05:50:53,020
me that's like that's okay i don't mind being loved i don't mind being loved at all

4505
05:50:56,380 --> 05:50:59,180
it's called codependence yeah codependence

4506
05:50:59,900 --> 05:51:05,580
oh should i nuke this vod i'm getting too f***ing emotional right now

4507
05:51:08,300 --> 05:51:14,540
i'm so lonely he cries profusely um i'm also saying this for myself

4508
05:51:16,460 --> 05:51:21,740
because i don't want to get too caught up i'm a very um

4509
05:51:22,140 --> 05:51:22,640
um

4510
05:51:25,660 --> 05:51:30,700
what i love i love very deeply so i also don't want to get my heart broken

4511
05:51:37,740 --> 05:51:40,060
ah f*** emotions uh

4512
05:51:42,220 --> 05:51:51,500
i still have to really pee i know i just like i i get so shy sometimes and i'm like i have to

4513
05:51:51,500 --> 05:51:58,940
destroy every vod inside i need to start over i mean because i have this like i want people to

4514
05:51:58,940 --> 05:52:03,580
have this image of me but i'm like no like let me just show them my real self i'm working on it

4515
05:52:05,180 --> 05:52:13,340
sorry for destroying vod you're good where we're going we don't need vods you just have it in your head

4516
05:52:14,300 --> 05:52:22,300

4519
05:52:31,100 --> 05:52:35,900

4523
05:52:49,260 --> 05:52:53,900

4645
06:07:11,180 --> 06:07:14,620
try to keep up with chat and read everything they say

4646
06:07:15,100 --> 06:07:21,420
read every sentence and you can't skip but you have to read it as fast as chat is moving

4647
06:07:25,740 --> 06:07:27,020

4649
06:07:36,860 --> 06:07:46,620
if you blow up to like 1k viewers it would be so it would be impossible

4650
06:07:48,220 --> 06:07:52,860
yeah it's actually sometimes it's hard to follow chat i kind of like i prefer having a small

4651
06:07:53,820 --> 06:08:01,340
ccv because i can keep up with chat when we first like had our second like the 2.0 stream

4652
06:08:01,420 --> 06:08:06,620
and we did have around like 900 people uh consecutively watching us and trying to keep up with

4653
06:08:06,620 --> 06:08:13,820
chat was a nightmare i was like actually like between that and then heading 17k on my twitter

4654
06:08:14,380 --> 06:08:19,580
i was kind of heartbroken because it was really hard to interact with you guys like because i

4655
06:08:19,580 --> 06:08:24,780
couldn't i liked liking a lot of your tweets to show you that i like liked it and you know read

4656
06:08:24,780 --> 06:08:28,700
them and stuff and now it's almost impossible for me to do that on twitter because i just get so

4657
06:08:28,700 --> 06:08:31,900
many fucking notifications from people liking all the porn that i retweet

4658
06:08:35,420 --> 06:08:38,300
mentioned the hauling girls yeah that's why i'm like i don't think it could be

4659
06:08:38,300 --> 06:08:43,100
one because of how i am uh in haul live just because like

4660
06:08:46,780 --> 06:08:53,500
i don't like the fact that some people because they're so large start to see their audience

4661
06:08:53,500 --> 06:08:59,980
as a number rather than individuals and i never want to feel that and i felt it when i hit 17k

4662
06:08:59,980 --> 06:09:04,940
on my haul and it sucked because i'm like i'm just looking at a number and i liked it when it was

4663
06:09:04,940 --> 06:09:09,980
way smaller because it's weird and i know it's mostly bots thank god like i think actually

4664
06:09:09,980 --> 06:09:14,620
knowing that it's mostly bots kind of make me felt better because i'm like okay there's still a

4665
06:09:14,620 --> 06:09:19,580
couple like humans i can interact with they're still individuals they're still like it's because

4666
06:09:19,580 --> 06:09:26,780
of me overwhelming yeah it's a lot of bots i wish i could purge them i really wish i could purge them

4667
06:09:28,380 --> 06:09:31,100
but i don't want to accidentally purge like people who are normal

4668
06:09:34,940 --> 06:09:40,540
uh oh i'm getting eepy i need to wash my face and i put on makeup today gross

4669
06:09:43,740 --> 06:09:49,260
i'm trying i went to a dermatologist because i just like have been breaking out really fucking

4670
06:09:49,260 --> 06:09:56,060
bad and even before like streaming and stuff um because it's not like stress related um and

4671
06:09:56,060 --> 06:10:02,620
they're just like oh you you have like a hormone imbalance and i'm like what the fuck

4672
06:10:04,700 --> 06:10:15,660
because like um so like i have a lot of like issues um so i have to be on birth control

4673
06:10:15,660 --> 06:10:22,460
um and birth control can fuck with your hormones and that's another reason like that's why i sometimes

4674
06:10:22,460 --> 06:10:30,460
have to take like mental uh medication and other medication but like it also regulates other parts

4675
06:10:31,740 --> 06:10:37,660
that would get fucked up otherwise if i didn't take it and so it's like the lesser of two evils

4676
06:10:37,660 --> 06:10:42,300
is that i get fucking acne or i go i go batshit crazy so i'd rather just get acne

4677
06:10:43,100 --> 06:10:50,620
oh just breed me instead that's pretty common yeah like a lot of and like because i get

4678
06:10:50,620 --> 06:10:58,060
really like tmi if you don't like to hear about like blood or periods please click off um i used

4679
06:10:58,060 --> 06:11:08,140
to get really horrible painful like feeling i'm stabbed in the fucking uterus um cramps i had

4680
06:11:08,140 --> 06:11:15,820
to go to urgent care before uh the way i was describing it my mom felt like i had like some

4681
06:11:15,820 --> 06:11:21,900
sort what is it called like we have it it's not like a cis like a non nodule there's like a

4682
06:11:23,020 --> 06:11:29,660
like one of like an over exploded or whatever the fuck but it was really it was just pain

4683
06:11:30,540 --> 06:11:38,300
it was just pain i've grown up a woman this is a Tuesday for me uh no i but i don't have endo

4684
06:11:38,300 --> 06:11:44,860
like i don't have endo um they do they do think i have polycystic ovary syndrome um

4685
06:11:46,140 --> 06:11:49,660
but they're still trying to figure it out that's why i've been going to the doctor's appointments

4686
06:11:50,780 --> 06:11:57,420
um i hate being a fucking woman uh there's so much fucking shit um

4687
06:11:58,380 --> 06:12:03,180
because like they didn't ultrasound on me and they didn't see anything physical but then my endocrinologist

4688
06:12:03,180 --> 06:12:10,460
was telling me that like it can like you can still have it and not have actual assists which i didn't

4689
06:12:10,460 --> 06:12:19,820
know that um but yeah it was like i would have like really fucking heavy periods just bleed

4690
06:12:19,820 --> 06:12:24,300
through super pads like i'm if you're a guy you probably don't know or maybe you have a sister

4691
06:12:24,300 --> 06:12:28,940
maybe you do know or a girlfriend or whatever um but like a super pad is like a different thickness

4692
06:12:28,940 --> 06:12:35,900
it's because like uh it's not it's not i'm going to the i'm going to the pharmacy uh you need tampons

4693
06:12:35,900 --> 06:12:43,180
but your pussy size no it's like it's not like large and like super isn't like a super huge pussy

4694
06:12:43,180 --> 06:12:50,540
it's it's like the flow and what it can hold um so when you have a really heavy flow usually you

4695
06:12:50,540 --> 06:12:56,700
have to get like supers um so i would do that and i would bleed through them real fast i'm so sorry

4696
06:12:56,700 --> 06:13:07,820
if this grosses you out i'm so sorry i'm so so so sorry um but uh yeah it just like really fucking

4697
06:13:07,820 --> 06:13:15,020
sucks um and then my yeah i'm like i was gonna describe some more symptoms i'm like never mind

4698
06:13:15,020 --> 06:13:31,580
but um supersize me um i remember like my mom uh telling my dad to go get tampons for the both

4699
06:13:31,580 --> 06:13:38,860
of us and my dad was like uh he's like you're my wife it's fine but like this is weird he's like

4700
06:13:38,860 --> 06:13:44,300
why can't we just have sons and i'm like hey i'm like hi my girl it's because like it's so

4701
06:13:44,300 --> 06:13:50,300
because it's like your kid is growing up you know he was just like i don't know it's i don't

4702
06:13:50,300 --> 06:13:54,060
know how to deal with this but like my dad has a younger sister too like i haven't on but like

4703
06:13:54,060 --> 06:14:01,260
they are so far apart in age that my dad's is like what i remember like really conservators

4704
06:14:01,260 --> 06:14:07,660
religious households so like sex education is not a huge thing but like i think i think my mom

4705
06:14:07,660 --> 06:14:13,660
educated my dad pretty well i'm gonna get a hormonal cycle so simple yeah i hate like

4706
06:14:14,300 --> 06:14:20,140
going through like pms like just like being upset maybe that maybe i'm pmsing although like

4707
06:14:20,140 --> 06:14:24,060
what you're really knowing about being on birth control is that i'm irregular so i don't really

4708
06:14:25,340 --> 06:14:28,540
like i don't know what the fuck i'm gonna get it just happens

4709
06:14:30,780 --> 06:14:36,540
um yeah men have a hormonal cycle i think it like takes place through a day but for women

4710
06:14:36,620 --> 06:14:39,820
it's it's a we have a month long hormonal cycle

4711
06:14:42,060 --> 06:14:48,780
yeah yeah men's is daily um and then for yeah for women it's like we have like

4712
06:14:50,540 --> 06:14:54,460
you know before we get it we have like ovulation

4713
06:14:56,780 --> 06:15:02,380
right before we get it period then like the time after that and then like maybe like a

4714
06:15:02,380 --> 06:15:09,660
fucking day or two of rest and then it's like ovulation and then

4715
06:15:13,500 --> 06:15:18,220
yeah it usually happens when you sleep that's why you wake up fucking shooting everywhere okay

4716
06:15:19,340 --> 06:15:22,460
why why are all the men surprised that they have a hormonal cycle

4717
06:15:23,660 --> 06:15:26,220
guys look you got yeah you guys have a hormonal cycle

4718
06:15:27,180 --> 06:15:30,380
how do you think your body regulates the t an estrogen in your body

4719
06:15:32,940 --> 06:15:36,780
you guys never knew that men have a horn that's wow

4720
06:15:40,620 --> 06:15:47,260
yeah you guys yeah you're just just a lot shorter but that's like yeah there's that's a sometimes um

4721
06:15:48,860 --> 06:15:55,100
that's why men can kind of freak out when their t levels are low or it's like there's a there's a

4722
06:15:55,100 --> 06:15:58,860
or you actually don't have enough estrogen in your body because remember men and women both make

4723
06:15:58,860 --> 06:16:05,900
estrogen um just yeah because then we just both have different levels of it so you have two less

4724
06:16:05,900 --> 06:16:13,820
you're like more likely to have certain behaviors vice versa and stuff it's just part of the fucking

4725
06:16:13,820 --> 06:16:20,220
it out process doesn't really change for us yeah it's like it's not drastic for you guys like it is

4726
06:16:20,220 --> 06:16:27,020
for women so then again we don't bleed from our privates each month yeah i feel like i've always

4727
06:16:27,020 --> 06:16:33,980
said and like all the girls joke about this like um if men had the same sort of hormonal cycles

4728
06:16:34,700 --> 06:16:44,380
as women did there would be like so much difference in like how those are treated because like if you

4729
06:16:45,260 --> 06:16:47,420
imagine you were like kicked in the nuts for like

4730
06:16:50,140 --> 06:16:54,220
at least like at maximum eight days like wouldn't you want a day off

4731
06:16:54,460 --> 06:17:01,020
but like you don't get a day off for that you don't get a day off for having like the first

4732
06:17:01,020 --> 06:17:03,340
day of your period is the fucking worst

4733
06:17:08,460 --> 06:17:12,780
well like one get well not not like in a good way like if it like surprises you not like when

4734
06:17:12,780 --> 06:17:19,420
you're expecting it in like a horny way can't go to work my peepee hurt that's true

4735
06:17:19,820 --> 06:17:28,540
i'm thinking like one no continuous kicks wait has any of you had like a kidney stone

4736
06:17:30,220 --> 06:17:34,300
have any like had a kidney stone or like a really like really bad constipation

4737
06:17:35,500 --> 06:17:43,900
i'm like trying to find an equivalent for you to understand no drink water the pain of a period it

4738
06:17:43,900 --> 06:17:50,780
is not like this is like women have like women have a higher pain tolerance than men

4739
06:17:51,900 --> 06:17:56,060
and you guys should totally testicular torsion um

4740
06:17:58,380 --> 06:18:05,020
like i know there is like those like simulators you can do where you can put them on on a guy

4741
06:18:05,020 --> 06:18:11,820
and it will like stimulate either like childbirth or a cramp i love watching those videos i remember

4742
06:18:11,820 --> 06:18:15,500
they did it for like i think it's i want to take talk of like a cop did it and they turned

4743
06:18:15,500 --> 06:18:22,460
it up to a 10 and he was like on the ground the cop and then they they put it on a woman and she

4744
06:18:22,460 --> 06:18:25,820
was just like oh yeah that's really fucking hurts but she was like just like standing and looking

4745
06:18:25,820 --> 06:18:34,380
around she was like fine how would a guy want that because it's just you don't have to want that

4746
06:18:34,380 --> 06:18:40,700
but it's like it's i think it would make men a lot more empathetic would you guys would you

4747
06:18:40,700 --> 06:18:46,140
take care of me if i was on my period and i wasn't feeling good pissing a stone was the most painful

4748
06:18:46,140 --> 06:18:52,300
thing i've experienced yeah my my dad my dad's diabetic so he's more apt to get to these stones

4749
06:18:52,300 --> 06:19:00,540
um and my dad's like is this what giving birth is like to my mom and mom's like no it's worse

4750
06:19:00,540 --> 06:19:09,260
imagine if you were torn from asshole to vagina you drink the blood you're gonna earn your red wings

4751
06:19:11,660 --> 06:19:15,980
now i don't want to be the simulator's i'm good i stick with empathy no sympathy needed

4752
06:19:18,780 --> 06:19:25,260
i'm into the store for your ultra pads but um no i don't like i might thankfully because like

4753
06:19:25,260 --> 06:19:28,940
again so this was before i was on birth control now that i'm on birth control i barely have a

4754
06:19:28,940 --> 06:19:35,580
period i live in life except now i fucking zits and like normally when you're my age you don't

4755
06:19:35,580 --> 06:19:41,020
have acne anymore so i usually maintain it with skincare um and i didn't because i'm stupid i

4756
06:19:41,020 --> 06:19:45,820
like finally went to the dermatologist because my doctor was just like whoa like you like what's

4757
06:19:45,820 --> 06:19:52,940
happened and like i don't have like bad acne um it's more like again i've said because i'm melanated

4758
06:19:52,940 --> 06:19:58,380
my skin will scar if i'm wearing makeup you can't even fucking tell but like if you were looking at

4759
06:19:58,380 --> 06:20:03,660
me with that makeup i have like a lot of like um like dark spots on my face like they almost look

4760
06:20:03,660 --> 06:20:12,060
like freckles and um but like or like the beauty marks on my face um and my doctor's like yeah no

4761
06:20:12,060 --> 06:20:16,380
that shouldn't be doing that and so i went to the dermatologist they're like oh yeah your hormones

4762
06:20:16,380 --> 06:20:23,820
are like really thrown off by your um your birth control so like we're gonna like put you on this

4763
06:20:23,820 --> 06:20:30,220
and it actually helps like regulate it i'm like this entire fucking time i've been on this for a

4764
06:20:30,220 --> 06:20:35,100
year and i could have why didn't you guys tell me this sooner they're like well you shouldn't have a

4765
06:20:35,100 --> 06:20:42,300
side effects i'm like fuck you do pimple patches help yes they do a lot actually yeah hyperpigmentation

4766
06:20:42,300 --> 06:20:47,500
i get hyperpigmentation and because i have dermatillomania it's fucking annoying or excorciation

4767
06:20:47,500 --> 06:20:51,100
disorder whatever it's called it's like it's almost like a form of ocd where you have like

4768
06:20:51,900 --> 06:20:58,220
i can't really explain it you can just google it um you think emi likes picket scabs you haven't

4769
06:20:58,220 --> 06:21:09,020
met me yet um i fuck gore to he moment doctor moment okay richie guy i can just get a grow

4770
06:21:09,020 --> 06:21:13,980
beer to hide him yeah like i always say beer just like the makeup for men but like again i look

4771
06:21:15,500 --> 06:21:21,100
um i just look like i have a lot of fucking freckles on my face um and usually they get

4772
06:21:21,100 --> 06:21:26,300
mistaken because i'll like i'll go out with no makeup i don't give a shit um and people just

4773
06:21:26,300 --> 06:21:32,620
like think i just have a lot of freckles or beauty marks um and then if i really want to

4774
06:21:32,620 --> 06:21:41,020
i'll just put like foundation on and it's gone i hate having to shave every other day

4775
06:21:43,180 --> 06:21:49,580
yeah i can't relate besides like i'll get like a couple of peach fuzzies actually like the other

4776
06:21:49,580 --> 06:21:55,820
day i got like one like chin hair and i was like oh my fucking god what the fuck is this

4777
06:21:56,540 --> 06:22:02,540
what's going on in my face my mom's like oh yeah they have to be around your age i'm like what am i

4778
06:22:02,540 --> 06:22:08,780
am i mutating but i just plucked it and i'm fine and i haven't seen it since

4779
06:22:13,580 --> 06:22:18,140
before without a beard before i lost weight it looked like a thumb oh like a thumb from like

4780
06:22:18,140 --> 06:22:25,020
spy kids or if i try to grow beard looks like pubes and i don't know those words oh i know like i

4781
06:22:25,740 --> 06:22:30,460
a lot of my co-workers who are younger than me um some of them are guys and they can't grow

4782
06:22:30,460 --> 06:22:36,140
beards and like again like men and women have like different like gripes with things like guys

4783
06:22:36,140 --> 06:22:39,580
worry about their fucking dick size or whatever and then growing beards and then women worry about

4784
06:22:39,580 --> 06:22:48,060
like literally every aspect of their fucking body yeah and so um uh like so i really

4785
06:22:48,140 --> 06:22:53,660
i try to empathize with men because i'm like oh i'm gonna have it easy but i'm like no you know

4786
06:22:53,660 --> 06:23:02,300
no they kind of don't because like i'm not a boy so i don't know kind of like i i recently figured

4787
06:23:02,300 --> 06:23:07,580
out how rudely men treat each other based on appearance or like how they carry themselves

4788
06:23:08,220 --> 06:23:17,100
and i thought it was a joke but i was like listening to um what was it no this wasn't

4789
06:23:17,100 --> 06:23:22,700
recently it was actually like months ago what the fuck i'm talking about before leave um one of my

4790
06:23:23,580 --> 06:23:29,820
co-workers because i i'm uh you know i'm a nosy bitch don't forget gemini moon um

4791
06:23:31,260 --> 06:23:35,820
and i was overhearing my uh male co-workers talk about a group chat and like they were

4792
06:23:35,820 --> 06:23:41,660
like roasting this kid in it and i was like holy fucking shit jesus fucking christ why do you have

4793
06:23:41,660 --> 06:23:47,500
him in there if you're just gonna shit on him um so like and they were like yeah they're making fun

4794
06:23:47,500 --> 06:23:52,060
of his appearance or that he spoke this and that and i'm like wow they're just as bad as girls

4795
06:23:53,500 --> 06:24:00,620
so like i i definitely uh it kind of like threw some sympathy at me there so like when i went

4796
06:24:00,620 --> 06:24:07,100
guys complain like oh i can't really grow a beard that well or i'm this or that i'm like you know

4797
06:24:07,100 --> 06:24:11,420
i get it we just have females have a different equivalent of that you know

4798
06:24:14,860 --> 06:24:21,980
no that's pretty random behavior with the g's yeah or just like um men having a sort of like

4799
06:24:24,860 --> 06:24:28,380
kind of like what is the word i want to use

4800
06:24:31,100 --> 06:24:34,300
it's like dick measuring contest like you have to like prove yourself

4801
06:24:35,180 --> 06:24:41,180
i don't know i've just observed that i feel like you guys are like kind of passive aggressive

4802
06:24:41,180 --> 06:24:50,460
sometimes in friend groups early yeah like men friendships are very interesting because i'm

4803
06:24:50,460 --> 06:24:54,620
like do you guys actually like each other because you're like making fun of each other you're calling

4804
06:24:54,620 --> 06:25:02,540
each other you're doing this you're doing that hegemonic masculinity but then i see the but then

4805
06:25:02,540 --> 06:25:09,100
like you're all like gay as fuck i'm like are you guys gonna make out or like are you touching

4806
06:25:09,100 --> 06:25:13,340
him on the ass like that and i'm like looking at my co-workers i'm like is he gay i'm like oh no he's

4807
06:25:13,340 --> 06:25:18,380
not gay he's just hanging out with his friends i guess i don't it's called the bromance oh that's

4808
06:25:18,380 --> 06:25:24,620
true bromance i love you in the most heterosexual way from like ryan hega

4809
06:25:25,020 --> 06:25:32,700
guys are very interesting like how they like i'm i'm sorry but i've been like studying you

4810
06:25:32,700 --> 06:25:38,860
like i'm a fucking weirdo i'm just like what the fuck like why are they like like it's so weird

4811
06:25:39,740 --> 06:25:47,820
so weird like before i went on my medical leave um because again i'm a i'm a mentor to a lot of

4812
06:25:47,820 --> 06:25:56,860
the people in my store um and it is a male dominated field so a lot of uh gentlemen are

4813
06:25:58,060 --> 06:26:03,420
not like i'm in their superior and so they'll come to me and talk to about stuff and be like oh

4814
06:26:03,420 --> 06:26:07,820
this girl or this guy and our friends and then this happened and then this happened and i'm like

4815
06:26:09,180 --> 06:26:14,300
why the why don't you guys just talk about your feelings and then just like oh we don't do that

4816
06:26:14,300 --> 06:26:20,380
we're guys and i'm like oh that's a good point you guys never really talk about your real feelings

4817
06:26:20,380 --> 06:26:28,940
it's kind of like it's kind of like superficial and i don't know why like i don't excuse me you should

4818
06:26:28,940 --> 06:26:35,900
excuse me um have feel like you can have a safe space to talk to your bros about how you feel

4819
06:26:36,860 --> 06:26:43,100
like i'm like i'm sitting and listening to this kid tell me about his parents divorce

4820
06:26:44,620 --> 06:26:52,300
and i'm like i don't know you that well one two you have like your boys are in the corner over

4821
06:26:52,300 --> 06:26:59,660
there you could go talk to them about it not that i like i'm not gonna like not listen to you but

4822
06:26:59,660 --> 06:27:07,500
i'm like why are you but then i realize that maybe it maybe it is a cultural thing maybe it is like

4823
06:27:07,500 --> 06:27:12,220
a make american cultural thing like you have to be tough and you have to have this air that like

4824
06:27:12,220 --> 06:27:17,500
you don't have feelings and stuff and it makes me really sad like i want you to be able to talk

4825
06:27:17,500 --> 06:27:23,020
about your feelings men should be able to talk about their fucking feelings especially your feelings

4826
06:27:23,100 --> 06:27:26,620
for me you can't see but i like did the cute like tuck my hair behind the ear

4827
06:27:29,180 --> 06:27:33,580
fending happens in brazil too yeah i feel like it's a cultural thing but you're not weak

4828
06:27:34,700 --> 06:27:39,740
feelings are a fucking normal thing honestly for me when a guy shows his feelings

4829
06:27:41,580 --> 06:27:46,940
it shows me a sense of maturity because you're in touch with yourself you touch yourself to me

4830
06:27:47,180 --> 06:27:50,220
um uh you're kind of

4831
06:27:52,700 --> 06:28:01,580
i don't know i feel like it makes you more open-minded um secret secret for you if you have a girlfriend

4832
06:28:01,580 --> 06:28:05,180
or if you want one talk about your feelings but don't be weird about it

4833
06:28:09,980 --> 06:28:14,380
being able to talk about your feelings and be vulnerable is a sign of strength in my opinion

4834
06:28:14,380 --> 06:28:22,860
exactly i got that cry and riz um yeah not from the get-go don't just like you know chill

4835
06:28:22,860 --> 06:28:26,220
like everybody else and then when you get closer and you're like wow i really like this person then

4836
06:28:26,220 --> 06:28:33,820
you can be like hey i wasn't feeling so good today because you said this to me and it kind of hurt

4837
06:28:33,820 --> 06:28:39,340
my feelings and if the girl immediately starts bitching at you that like oh i wouldn't ever

4838
06:28:40,300 --> 06:28:42,620
tell her to shut the fuck up and leave her

4839
06:28:46,860 --> 06:28:50,780
sorry i like playing therapist and being a big sis slash mom sometimes

4840
06:28:51,820 --> 06:28:57,580
i don't know i just i just like helping people out gotta wait till a few drinks get into no

4841
06:28:58,620 --> 06:29:02,780
no you don't fucking get drunk and share your feelings because then it just sounds like word

4842
06:29:02,780 --> 06:29:09,980
vomit and creepy took that advice to heart to almost be her girlfriend i think at the ick they're

4843
06:29:09,980 --> 06:29:15,100
not the right person precisely is it a therapist or she'd be spitting facts

4844
06:29:17,740 --> 06:29:22,060
we have to ask more details to start taking potshots of who i was subconsciously inspired by

4845
06:29:22,060 --> 06:29:29,500
yeah it's hard because i know for guys because women can be really bitchy like they can be catty

4846
06:29:29,740 --> 06:29:39,500
um not all women but women sometimes they will be passive aggressive and they will use things

4847
06:29:39,500 --> 06:29:45,260
you've said to them against you and if that happens leave because they do not care about

4848
06:29:45,260 --> 06:29:51,820
your feelings if they're taking really low blows and shots women know how to hit you or it hurts

4849
06:29:51,820 --> 06:29:57,260
sometimes and some men too some men i was watching this like tiktok of these women who it was like

4850
06:29:57,260 --> 06:30:03,260
pop a balloon if you want to if you don't want to date this guy and it was this like really uh arrogant

4851
06:30:03,260 --> 06:30:10,380
like dentist doctor and so they go to interview the first woman and they're like hey so

4852
06:30:10,940 --> 06:30:14,540
like why did you pop your balloon like why don't you want to date him and she's like you know he

4853
06:30:14,540 --> 06:30:19,020
came across this really arrogant i don't really think that's appropriate i feel like this this and

4854
06:30:19,020 --> 06:30:24,620
this and the first thing he said to her was just like who did your teeth because they don't look good

4855
06:30:24,620 --> 06:30:29,820
and like that's how he responded he didn't be like oh i'm sorry you feel that way but i'm going to

4856
06:30:29,820 --> 06:30:36,780
rebuttal with a valid point insert point here like he just responded the most dickish way and it's like

4857
06:30:37,740 --> 06:30:43,500
for every woman that popped their balloon and like let me tell you like they nicely explained

4858
06:30:43,500 --> 06:30:52,780
why they weren't attracted to him like one woman said um i feel like your arrogance because you

4859
06:30:52,780 --> 06:30:55,980
come up this is like there's a difference between confidence and arrogance and i feel like your

4860
06:30:55,980 --> 06:31:01,260
arrogance against would get in the way of you loving me she's like i would be able to love you

4861
06:31:01,260 --> 06:31:07,660
but i don't think you'd have enough room to love me and then and she and then she like made some sort

4862
06:31:07,660 --> 06:31:16,860
of um i think like illusion i can't remember the english term like she made like a like an

4863
06:31:16,860 --> 06:31:22,700
illustration of um not like a physical illustration but like you know what i'm trying to say um

4864
06:31:22,940 --> 06:31:30,620
turn to an a yeah like a metaphor of like giving pieces of like her love in a box and him not

4865
06:31:30,620 --> 06:31:38,220
being able to like have it and then he illusion was right okay and then he was immediately set

4866
06:31:38,220 --> 06:31:44,780
like essentially just started calling her crazy and gaslighting her it was just like um well

4867
06:31:46,060 --> 06:31:52,140
he said like i really hear and understand you know get where you're coming from but the way

4868
06:31:52,140 --> 06:31:56,940
you said that did not make any sense this and this and this and he was like trying to pick

4869
06:31:56,940 --> 06:32:03,100
apart argument instead of just being like no i think i would actually you know have be confident

4870
06:32:03,100 --> 06:32:09,820
and then be able to have love for somebody and i was like this dude fucking sucks uh my headphones

4871
06:32:09,820 --> 06:32:16,220
died so i can't hear 33 cents feeling better thank you mr tony is as based as ever either

4873
06:32:22,060 --> 06:32:30,780

4874
06:32:30,780 --> 06:32:34,220

4875
06:32:35,100 --> 06:32:41,580
because i was like wow and mind you these are like gorgeous women and he and he was a nice looking

4876
06:32:41,580 --> 06:32:47,740
guy but then like you realize like as he's talking like oh he's an ugly man on the inside though

4877
06:32:48,380 --> 06:32:52,540
but so like it's true like men can also be really passive aggressive and kind of pull out stuff

4878
06:32:53,180 --> 06:32:57,420
that you wouldn't expect those both sides human beings just suck that's why i have three cats

4879

lonely i'm so lonely didn't you try to mainsplain yeah self-walk yes yes that's exactly what i'm

4887
06:34:00,220 --> 06:34:09,580

4888
06:34:09,580 --> 06:34:15,100
overshare and yeah and i was like uh he's talking about a period with the fuck girl gross

4889
06:34:20,380 --> 06:34:24,140
i know i know you have you guys enjoy the yapping but i mean like sometimes the

4890
06:34:24,140 --> 06:34:27,180
the subject matter in which i talk about it people don't like

4891
06:34:30,700 --> 06:34:35,660
what i like about you chibi you just did a full workshop fat did i really

4892
06:34:37,820 --> 06:34:40,460
holy fuck dude

4893
06:34:43,100 --> 06:34:44,700
what the fuck is wrong with me sometime

4894
06:34:47,180 --> 06:34:51,660
gets you thinking i like people to be introspective i don't you know i like philosophy a lot

4895
06:34:53,340 --> 06:34:55,820
just kind of like think about human nature and all that shit

4896
06:34:56,780 --> 06:35:03,100
casual seven-hour yapathon i mean if it's controversial something like that

4897
06:35:03,660 --> 06:35:07,020
a tit trigger warning or content warning wouldn't hurt

4898
06:35:10,060 --> 06:35:15,820
but like i don't i think we're all adults here and if you hear something you don't

4899
06:35:15,820 --> 06:35:20,940
like you just leave i shouldn't have to be like trigger warning i'm talking about blood

4900
06:35:21,900 --> 06:35:24,300
i don't i'm sorry i'm not gonna

4901
06:35:26,300 --> 06:35:29,100
we're adults i'm not gonna hold your hand for that stuff

4902
06:35:33,820 --> 06:35:37,340
and then like oh if it's like really bad like when we were doing like the class of

4903
06:35:37,340 --> 06:35:41,500
09 stuff i knew was gonna be edgy so i'm like disclaimer there's gonna be edgy stuff

4904
06:35:41,500 --> 06:35:45,260
this probably isn't the stream for you but that's like immediately when i started stream but like

4905
06:35:46,220 --> 06:35:50,540
and i did say like guys tmi i'm about to talk about like periods and stuff so like

4906
06:35:51,260 --> 06:35:55,180
i didn't preface it and i do usually preface just like kind of subconsciously

4907
06:35:55,900 --> 06:36:00,380
say it out loud to you guys like oh i might talk about something you not like might not like in the next

4908
06:36:00,380 --> 06:36:01,020
five seconds

4909
06:36:04,380 --> 06:36:08,060
she be made for the sake of the future we should have a rule stating we're 18 plus stream

4910
06:36:09,180 --> 06:36:10,220
i think that's a given

4911
06:36:11,980 --> 06:36:17,900
why should i make why should i have a rule saying i'm an 18 plus stream when it's obvious i'm an

4912
06:36:17,900 --> 06:36:18,860
18 plus streamer

4913
06:36:22,540 --> 06:36:22,860
you know

4914
06:36:25,100 --> 06:36:25,660

4915
06:36:26,700 --> 06:36:32,060

hmm

4950
06:40:04,860 --> 06:40:08,220

4951
06:40:08,220 --> 06:40:16,300
mini bosses because then i was gonna say the uh what's that fucking thing that jumps around

the fallen star beast was actually really beautiful

4957
06:40:57,580 --> 06:41:00,620
no i wasn't thinking the falling star beast i'm thinking i was thinking of the one that looks

4958
06:41:00,620 --> 06:41:05,100
like a deer for a second um but the falling star beast yes was my favorite um and then the

4959
06:41:05,100 --> 06:41:10,540

4965
06:41:51,260 --> 06:41:59,900
it took me forever to beat radon because i was so one it was like this is that was

4966
06:41:59,900 --> 06:42:06,940
elton ring was like the second from soft game i played um and so i didn't know how to approach

4967
06:42:06,940 --> 06:42:15,100
anything and then i can't like i didn't know any strats like to defeat radon

4968
06:42:17,340 --> 06:42:22,380
and i couldn't even like then i looked up like walkthroughs but like how to

4969
06:42:22,380 --> 06:42:26,940
fight him then i found like oh you can like cheese like boss i was like what the fuck is

4970
06:42:26,940 --> 06:42:33,500
teasing and i just figured out what it was um and then i couldn't even cheese radon properly i was

4971
06:42:33,500 --> 06:42:39,820
so fucking shit but then literally after i beat him i like honestly everything changed when i got

4972
06:42:39,820 --> 06:42:45,740
the black knife i can't lie i fucking abused the use of the black knife i'm not good at games

4973
06:42:45,740 --> 06:42:50,060
i just i don't play games skillfully i am just smart

4974
06:42:56,460 --> 06:43:00,060
figured you can use some of the weapons as terrain to eat oh yeah no yeah i knew that

4975
06:43:01,020 --> 06:43:05,420
wonk play style what build did you use an elton ring uh i used a

4976
06:43:08,220 --> 06:43:11,100
again i haven't played elton ring like a year so i can't remember a lot

4977
06:43:11,100 --> 06:43:26,140
but i didn't mean to do that um what is it called it was blood build

4978
06:43:26,780 --> 06:43:36,540
i actually i was like a blood and faith build

4979
06:43:39,740 --> 06:43:42,460
and i used a lot of arcane too i didn't use rivers of blood

4980
06:43:43,260 --> 06:43:48,700
i actually used the um the halo scythe a lot i used halo scythe the black knife

4981
06:43:48,700 --> 06:43:53,500
i started off as a confessor because i literally just picked one i didn't know what the fuck to

4982
06:43:53,580 --> 06:43:59,100
scale with i didn't know how things scaled i literally elton ring is the first game

4983
06:43:59,100 --> 06:44:05,020
i like actively did so much fucking research on all the fucking lore i watched about it all

4984

4993
06:44:58,860 --> 06:45:05,100
i mean like on stream i mean after strani does because strani is like such a fucking

4994
06:45:05,180 --> 06:45:10,540
good gamer she like hundred percent shit and i'm like looking at her watching her streams i'm like

4995
06:45:11,100 --> 06:45:17,500
jesus fuck why am i so shit at games and like i've played so many games for a while and i'll

4996
06:45:17,500 --> 06:45:22,540
actively try to be better at them but i just fucking suck man like

4997
06:45:22,540 --> 06:45:36,860
like like i played hundreds of hours of valorant in csgo and i still was a fucking silver okay

4998
06:45:39,980 --> 06:45:45,660
but then like again i but then i was like nasty a destiny in cod so i don't understand

4999
06:45:45,900 --> 06:45:57,500
i think valorant that's the issue listen i needed a fix i needed something else that wasn't csgo

5000
06:45:58,300 --> 06:46:05,100
and i liked the concept of heroes with like abilities on top of the csgo mechanics or just

5001
06:46:05,100 --> 06:46:13,260
counter strike mechanics in general um i probably won't i was not a valet girl um i probably won't

5002
06:46:13,260 --> 06:46:17,660

well tell the other girls to buy gmod because i'm not gonna i don't want to bully them into getting it

5031
06:49:48,860 --> 06:49:53,580
stuff and like i can just like add a little bit but i kind of just want a focused stream

5032
06:49:55,340 --> 06:50:01,580
because i feel like that would be beneficial um like a focused asmr stream that isn't let's

5033
06:50:01,580 --> 06:50:05,820
so i don't go off on tangents for like five hours and it's like a five hour asmr stream

5034
06:50:05,820 --> 06:50:09,340
the majority of it is me just whispering really stupidly

5035
06:50:09,900 --> 06:50:11,900

you're gonna bathe a cat or even a dog make sure um you put like a towel actually under them and then

5132
07:01:16,940 --> 07:01:20,940
when you fill it up with water because they can't they freak out when they don't have grip because

5133
07:01:20,940 --> 07:01:25,180
when they have grip they'll actually just kind of stand there uh so if you lay something down

5134
07:01:25,180 --> 07:01:31,020
they'll feel a lot better um so i put uh the towel in the sink filled up with you know lukewarm water

5135
07:01:31,020 --> 07:01:36,860
and she just looked like such a little wet rat i wonder if i can find a i can't did i take a

5137
07:01:42,540 --> 07:01:52,540

5138
07:01:52,540 --> 07:01:57,500

5139
07:01:57,500 --> 07:02:05,580

5140
07:02:05,580 --> 07:02:11,500
to bathe her because she couldn't like move maneuver her body to bathe herself and sometimes
