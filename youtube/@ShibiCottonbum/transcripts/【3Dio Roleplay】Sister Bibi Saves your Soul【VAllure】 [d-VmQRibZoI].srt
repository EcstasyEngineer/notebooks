1
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You

2
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You

3
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You

4
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You

5
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You

6
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You

7
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You

8
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You

9
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:09,360
See what brings you in to the cathedral today one moment. Oh my head popped off

10
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,080
That did not happen before

11
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
No matter

12
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,280
Let's me

13
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You know life is really

14
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Hello, sorry, I tend to lose my head

15
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You will have to turn me up I will tell you that right now

16
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Because if I turn myself up I will peek

17
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Also make sure you have the feature turned off that

18
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Limits ASMR the go to your settings on the video

19
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You can send me your mirrors one of them

20
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I don't I don't know why my head's not sticking

21
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's very weird it was sticking before I literally had no issues before I started stream

22
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I was like, oh, let me get this all set up really fast

23
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So I don't worry about it later and have to keep moving my head around but it doesn't matter. I'm still losing my head

24
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I almost burst out laughing

25
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
All right, hold on. Oh come on. There we go

26
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
This family curse of ours it's it's very intense

27
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I believe the setting is it's called a stable volume so make sure that that is turned off

28
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Turn off stable volume to better enjoy ASMR streams in general

29
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Let me see if I some of you might have noticed I had the game I was trying to check my audio with an unlisted stream

30
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:40,000
But some of you saw it before I can market as unlisted because it didn't let me market as unlisted

31
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You little cheeky things sneaking into my enlisted stream trying to test my audio

32
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It was about four of you and I kicked you out real quick

33
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Let's me see

34
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Because I wanted to do all this before I started but it doesn't seem to matter anymore

35
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Because if I turn up my gain any higher you're going to hear a buzz and it's not a good buzz

36
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Anything past a certain point doesn't sound right

37
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Unless I come very close to you or if I talk in my normal speaking voice

38
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Yeah, yeah, make sure you turn it off

39
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Sounds good. Good. Are we fine? Are we good? Are we good and fine then? Are we decent?

40
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I can't believe my head popped up. That's so embarrassing

41
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You can hear a buzz. Okay, I'm turning it back down then

42
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
So, just max out all your audio. It doesn't matter

43
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You'll survive

44
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
How is the church ambiance? Does it sound all right?

45
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And now, more ambiance

46
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Any issues since the squish mellow? Not that I know of

47
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I have the squish mellow above my desk instead

48
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Yes, the Veeveb does sound nice. This is from the Tel Veeveb plugin

49
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:43,000
My outfit you see today is from Booth and the background I'm using is from ArtStation

50
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It is linked in the description and then I'm using some wonderful assets from just VTube Studio natively

51
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
So, we don't get geekier girlies. If you want to make your ASMR streams more interesting

52
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You can just throw in a couple of things just to kind of make the ambiance a little bit better

53
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
That is a lovely rosary. Thank you. Thank you. It was passed down from my mother

54
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
The ads all blow my ears

55
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,000
My brother in Christ, why do you not have an art blocker yet? I don't understand

56
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,000
So, I have some, I don't know if you can hear the Gagorian chants in the background

57
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
But I have Gagorian chants in Rain Sounds playing. It's probably very quiet, but that is fine

58
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I don't care too much. The video will probably get claimed no matter what, because it was strikes, I don't know

59
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
But I will continue to provide the best ASMR that I can

60
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You don't hear any chanting?

61
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
What about now?

62
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I just start screaming my head off

63
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Okay, yeah, it's supposed to be some fireplace ambiance, some like writing and chanting, like little subtle chanting

64
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I'm going to turn it down just a tad, because I don't want it to overpower

65
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
When you hear the same thing looped over and over again, it can be quite grating I would say

66
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
So, you thought it was the voices again

67
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
But hello, if you are new here, my name is Bibi Kuddlebun

68
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I am the sister of Shibi Kottenbaum, I will be taking over her channel today

69
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I live as a nun in the UK, and it is very nice to meet you all and giving me the chance to spread the Lord's good word to you all

70
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:51,000
This is a great Zelda impression, that is Zelda British, I don't understand

71
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
But anyways, this will mostly be a talking and chatting and role-playing stream

72
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
If you are more interested in getting ASMR triggers, I am sorry

73
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
But there will not be a lot besides maybe some ear cupping

74
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Or some finger fluttering, the sound of holy water

75
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Me doing unintelligible whispers, and also reading your marrows

76
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
So we will, if you want to stick around, you can, and I would appreciate you being here

77
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Again, I am from the UK, so I will be speaking in a different accent than you are normally used to

78
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
If you misunderstand me, or if you cannot understand what I am saying, I apologise

79
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I know it can be difficult for you to listen to my sister's colleague, Strawny, because she is from Scotland

80
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,000
So I will try my best to enunciate and act accordingly

81
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Yes, I may be speaking in tongues, we will see

82
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
How is accents different from shebees, their sisters?

83
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Again, I was, so our mother, you guys know that our family is quite large

84
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And my mother was worried that we were becoming corrupted

85
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:36,000
So she sent me and my sisters away from each other, so that the corruption could not spread

86
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
So I was raised by a distant relative in the UK

87
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Shebe was raised in America, Shebevely was raised in Canada

88
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Because we have family all over, so that is the reason why we sound different from each other

89
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Shebe has a relative without a foul mouth, of course, of course

90
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I don't know what they call it, I am what they call, what do the Japanese say?

91
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Say so, I am what they call, I am say so

92
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I am uncorruptible, I am very thankful for being able to draw closer to God

93
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:36,000
And I hope that I can assist those who have strayed from his light today

94
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I may be reading you some scripture, and I may be doing some other things, so we will see

95
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
This is an improv role play, by the way, so I apologise in advance

96
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And if you are offended by this, get over yourself, that's all I am going to say

97
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Sorry for repeating, but is there a reason you have a different last name, is there a Mr or Mrs Cuddlebomb?

98
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I changed my last name to disassociate myself from the Cottonbomb family

99
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Cottonbomb is quite an unseemly last name in my opinion, and I am a lot sweeter than my sisters

100
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I know my sisters can carry themselves a little crudely at times

101
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:45,000
We have only just started growing closer again, so I have recently started associating with my sister

102
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,000
She has cleaned up her act and she has gotten a job running a hotel, and I am quite proud of her

103
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
So I have come from the UK to see her endeavours, I have been here for a couple of days now

104
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Some of you have seen me here and there, my sister has stolen my outfit a few times

105
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
When she was playing another video game, very rude of her, very rude, but I forgive her, as the Lord says

106
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
We forgive our brother's transgressions, and I will do so

107
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
How can an innocuous nun ever offend anyone? I don't know, I don't know

108
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I don't know, I think the hotel, yes, yes, the hotel seems very busy

109
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:39,000
So I am very thankful to have, I don't know why she calls you this, but the harem here today

110
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
To listen to my ASMR

111
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I heard from Shabbatani the herna siblings live with you

112
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Oh, her siblings still live with me, two of her older brothers and her older sister stay with me

113
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:08,000
They are not as well behaved as I would like, but it is very hard being a single aunt raising three young adults

114
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Your sister says you are doing good at dealing with werewolves

115
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
What did my sister tell you about werewolves?

116
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I want to hear nothing about werewolves

117
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I don't, I don't want to talk, I don't want to talk about werewolves

118
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Yes, I've had to stave off an infestation from the church, it was a long and hard fight

119
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Vampires are no different

120
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Are you down with the fever? Oh no, bless you for asking though

121
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Alright, shall we begin?

122
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I will introduce you to the church

123
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Let me hold it on, there we go

124
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Thanks

125
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
So this is the church of Saint Lapin

126
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:37,000
The church is very old, it could use some more love and care

127
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,000
We have some nuns, usually down that hallway where the nun's quarters are

128
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Up above you see there is where the nun's quarters are

129
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
And then across the way is the library

130
00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:03,000
You can see it seems like brother Michael has left his books out, but it is fine

131
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,000
And then we also have a lot of, we are run by many different monks

132
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
We have Saint, not Saint, brother Michael, Luke and John

133
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
And they are the ones that oversee this establishment

134
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
But yes, Saint Lapin is a very important saint for the Bonne people

135
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:34,000
And I pray to Saint Lapin every day that he removes my family's curse of being a Dullahan

136
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
We still don't know how to break said curse, it is the work of the devil I swear

137
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
But what more can you do really besides have faith?

138
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
So I will continue to have faith

139
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
You have sinned

140
00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I have asked for some of you to send me your confessions

141
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I will read said confessions a little later time

142
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,000
But for now I shall give you your, I shall read you some scripture

143
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:21,000
And you can tell me now in the chat what sins you are wishing to be absolved of

144
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,000
The more darker ones you can reserve for the Marshmallow as they call it

145
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
It can be really handy to be able to detach your head, I suppose, but sometimes it just gets in the way

146
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I can be, you know, working on writing and taking notes and then my head falls off

147
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:47,000
So it is, it can be a little bit more, just the time, just the time

148
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
The sins of your lust

149
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Oh yes, one of the most gravest sins are the sins of the flesh

150
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:10,000
So I can pull up some scriptures for you in that we can meditate on them together

151
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I spit right outside the doorway of Walmart on the way out

152
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Why would you do such a thing?

153
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Why is it a sin? Why is it so?

154
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Well, you have to think, so

155
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,000
God made us in his holy image and in his own holy image

156
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,000
We have to be, you know, as they say, treat ourselves like a temple

157
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
We have to treat our bodies with respect

158
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,000
And if you go on defiling your body by using it lustfully

159
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Out of wedlock, it is bad in the eyes of God

160
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
You just saw a man spit inside the doorway

161
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,000
The sister sounds more English than anyone from my hometown and I'm from an English market town

162
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Well, it depends, I have a unique regional dialect

163
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I know one of my nephews is from London and he has a stronger street accent

164
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Not very proper of him

165
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Madam Shibi defiles us quite a bit

166
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I do not know what you speak of and I do not think I want to know what you speak of

167
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
My sister has told me she has changed her ways but it seems like she has not

168
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:51,000
In one of our bodies is recreated as a temple of Aphrodite

169
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Oh, my sweet, sweet pagan

170
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Aphrodite is a pagan god, the one true god is our lord and his son Jesus

171
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:09,000
So you will not be recreated in the body, the temple of Aphrodite

172
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:16,000
As she is a false god, a false witness and a work of the devil actually

173
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
What region? Don't ask, I'm not that smart

174
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
My cloth is quite distracting

175
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I don't know what you speak of, I am wearing the normal vestments of my order

176
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Although, it seems to have made my skin a little old

177
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I am wearing very white, what is it called?

178
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Tight

179
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I do not look too closely then

180
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I would hate to cause you to stumble

181
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,000
They say if your right eye is causing you to stumble, rip it out and throw it away from you

182
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Figuratively of course, but it means to remove yourself from the situation

183
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:17,000
So if I am too distracting, then perhaps you should look away from me

184
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Did I commit some sort of sin for my cat to run away from me while wearing shoes?

185
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I do not know which of what you speak, it is quite confusing what I have just read

186
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Sister BB, do you also preach? Is that for the brothers of St. Philippine?

187
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I mostly spend my days meditating on scripture, drawing closer to God

188
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:01,000
and bonding with him through prayer, maintaining the church halls and organising

189
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I do a lot of what is similar to my sister, she we accepted to church and not a hotel

190
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I make sure everything is nice and clean and dandy and all that stuff

191
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
As a woman, I am of the weaker vessel as they say

192
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:25,000
So I do not have a place preaching or holding salmon, but that is okay

193
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I do make time to teach the little ones in our congregation and teach and help the women that attend the church

194
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
The other bunny girls are quite, you have to understand we are bunny people

195
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
There are quite a lot of children that need to be raised in the knowledge of the Lord

196
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Sister, can we start a holy crusade in your name bringing your image to the savages?

197
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Well, the Bible says that idolatry is a sin

198
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:09,000
So I wouldn't recommend using me as a sort of idol

199
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Go on preaching yourself and spreading the news of Jesus Christ and all his miraculous works, I would say

200
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Sister, baby, I am tempted to sin every time I look at feet and armpits

201
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
How can I cleanse myself of these thoughts?

202
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Very interesting to ask

203
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I do not know why these things would cause you to sin as they are just extensions of our body

204
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:44,000
And maybe I am assuming that you are seeing them in a lustful way

205
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,000
So in order to see them in not a lustful way, you have to think of them as what they are

206
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Just aspects of your body, tools to be used, feet to help you walk, armpits to help you sweat

207
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:10,000
And I think when you break it down into its most simplest form, then you will be able to combat these foul thoughts

208
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Sister, baby, does it hurt to offer a flagellation as penance?

209
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Perhaps personal flagellation by you sister?

210
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Oh yes, of course, of course we offer that

211
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I had a younger disciple in the past do a similar speech to mine that I am talking about right now

212
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
And she was very into self-flagellation and we have adopted the practice

213
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:50,000
So yes, I do have some whips and flails to participate in helping you be repented upon your sins

214
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Perhaps we can do that towards the end of our teachings today

215
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:11,000
The flagellation is one of the most important and amazing acts one can do on to God

216
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:21,000
You are giving yourself pain and washing yourself with your blood with his holy love

217
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:35,000
And God looks down on you with warmth and praise as he sees what you have put yourself through to make good on what you have done

218
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:41,000
You certainly need to be corrected, I suppose

219
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Do not fall for the honey words, sister, the only fit pleasure of getting whipped by a sister of the cloth

220
00:30:52,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I'm not quite sure about that, I think I'll take their word for it, they seem like good folk

221
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:08,000
It's being a non-common practice among bunny women, there are a few of us, not too many

222
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,000
But there are quite a few again, only people are very, very abundant

223
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:23,000
So it's not hard to find us in varying jobs in careers, I would say

224
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:37,000
The only pleasure I feel is the pleasure of being washed of mind, son

225
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Oh and you know, I have just something for that, so give me just a second

226
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I have it

227
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Sister, are you at all familiar with the God of the cloth?

228
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
No, I'm not

229
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I'm not

230
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I'm not

231
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I'm not

232
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I love it

233
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Sister, are you at all familiar with the goddess known as Azera?

234
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I don't believe in any false gods, I do not know of it whom you speak of

235
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I have seen a very large, voluptuous woman hanging out with my sister, but I do not

236
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I don't know if that's who you're referring to, because I have heard my sister call her by the same name

237
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:53,000
What relation are you to Shibi, she is my twin sister, or triplet really, we are of three

238
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Who let a cat into the church?

239
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Whatever, God loves all his pitiful creatures

240
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Excuse me sir, I'm going to have to ask you to leave the premises

241
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Yes you, Mr Kitty Cat

242
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Please, you are...

243
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Excuse me

244
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Why are you so large for a cat?

245
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
You're more like a little lion cub

246
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,000
God, I want Shibi to sit on my fuck three

247
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
I don't know what that means

248
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I will pass the message along to her though

249
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Sister Bebe, does one need to worry about birth control after being failed at the brim of Christ's love?

250
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Or has he had the SNP?

251
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I don't know what birth control has to do with God's and Christ's love, but I pray you be filled by Christ constantly

252
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
That's all I have to say about that

253
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Must have been Helman, Kiz, and my mother, Bunny, the Shelter, Shibi and Bebe

254
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Well, it is kind of the custom to have the types of names that we do

255
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Sorry, pardon, I have itchy eyeball

256
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:48,000
But we were usually called more colourful names by our mother growing up so it wasn't hard to differentiate

257
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Mysterious Bumi

258
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I've heard of this Bumi, I've heard he is something of a highwayman, robber, a thief, a menace

259
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I'm not quite sure though

260
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
But anyways, forever

261
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Going back to what I was going to do before

262
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I have some holy water

263
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
So let me wash your sins away

264
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Come close, here, let me pull your face close

265
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Hi there

266
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Oh, you are a looker, aren't you? You are quite handsome and beautiful

267
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
God created you well, didn't he?

268
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Your friends must be jealous of you

269
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Hopefully not too envious because envy is a sin

270
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:27,000
So I want you to close your eyes and just let God's love in his holy water wash over

271
00:36:45,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I wish I was an artist so I could draw Sister Bee Bee kneeling down in front of the altar with mouth open and tongue out ready to receive communion

272
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Oh, that would be absolutely lovely actually

273
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I always receive communion on my knees

274
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Do not worry, you do not need to be a follower of the faith to be cleansed by the holy water of God

275
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Through his love Jesus Christ will heal you and heal all your wounds

276
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Do I receive and join our communion?

277
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Of course, of course I do

278
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:02,000
It is always my pleasure to be able to take a piece of God's flesh, Jesus's flesh in my mouth

279
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,000
It is a holy right and one that I am thankful to be able to participate in

280
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I am not someone you can confess to in a confessional, dear brother

281
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,000
You would have to speak to one of the priests

282
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
But maybe I'd be able to arrange something

283
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:43,000
God someone please get this cat out of here

284
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I think I got a loose cat

285
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I think I got a loose cat

286
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I think I got a loose cat

287
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I think I got a loose cat

288
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I think I got a loose cat

289
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I think I got a loose cat

290
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I think I got a loose cat

291
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I think I got a loose cat

292
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
I think I got a loose cat hair in my eye

293
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
And it is itchy

294
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
These random street cats just keep coming into the church

295
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
But what can you do?

296
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
The cat must have been sent by the Lord

297
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Maybe, who knows?

298
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
God loves all his creatures

299
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Sister, I must confess

300
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Your twin sister makes me want to break my vows at all now

301
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Please forgive me

302
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
What vows, sweet child

303
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
What vows, my dear

304
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Admit them to me

305
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,000
What thoughts have you been having?

306
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
I ask only of concern, am I sweetling?

307
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Sister, I haven't ever prayed before

308
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Will you help me do my knees and teach me how?

309
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Of course

310
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
It is quite easy to get on your knees to pray

311
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Especially if you overcome by the Lord

312
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
And His Holy Spirit

313
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Something seems wrong

314
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I feel, I feel a dark energy over me

315
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
And over you

316
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Look into my eyes

317
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Have you been cursed?

318
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Have you been doing unrighteous things?

319
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
There is a darkness over you

320
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Something doesn't seem right

321
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I might have to call a priest to perform an exorcism

322
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
What have you done, you sinner?

323
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,000
How did you come to be, come to have such a sinful nature?

324
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Highly suspicious

325
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
I don't know what this is

326
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
I might need to get more holy water

327
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
You were corrupted

328
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Fall into sin, tempted by strongy and hypnotism

329
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Strongy, strongy

330
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
That name sounds familiar

331
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
She's the Scottish, is she not?

332
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Yes

333
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
A wicked devilish thing

334
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Using her guiles to hypnotise

335
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Simple men

336
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Into doing her whims

337
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
It must be an act of the devil

338
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:53,000
You feel like you have been cursed for a long time

339
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Don't worry, I will fix that

340
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,000
I will save your wavering soul, sweet thing

341
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,000
The Lord's light shall play you from the shadows

342
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,000
And reveal your golden innocence once more

343
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I will save you, my child

344
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Let me get some more holy water

345
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
I'm getting myself wet, oops

346
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
I'm soaking myself

347
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
There's the mist setting on this holy water bottle

348
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
There it is

349
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Probably should have brought a towel

350
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Now am I more wet?

351
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Be cleansed

352
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Be cleansed

353
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,000
I will not let you go so easily to the devil

354
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
There's no end to some holiness

355
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I think I keep stumbling over my words

356
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Because you are so close to my face

357
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I think I have to back up

358
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
This is unseemly to be seen so close to you

359
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:14,000
I do not want the members of the church getting the wrong idea

360
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
I'm getting myself wet

361
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Please cleanse my soul, Sister Beepie

362
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
And lead me towards the path of forgiveness

363
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
And away from temptation

364
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
I want you just that

365
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I want you just that

366
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Hello, Sister, as in none, are you small to just to do?

367
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Of course I am

368
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Hello, Evelynx

369
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Oh, it is the seductress we talked about earlier

370
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
It is Strawny Cuddles

371
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
She of the devil

372
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Co-hypnotises men to bow to her every whim

373
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Interesting

374
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:59,000
I'm surprised she would leave her followers on the house of God

375
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
I will cleanse them

376
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
You are respectful and pray

377
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:10,000
It is good to see you repentant, Succubus

378
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,000
I will take care of your former worse

379
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
And I will cleanse them

380
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
And I will guide them

381
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,000
And guide them to God's light

382
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,000
You sweet, weary souls

383
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
You wayward ones

384
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Go on, or draw you close

385
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Like a shepherd, draw closest to his sheep

386
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I keep stumbling over my words

387
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
I don't know why

388
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,000
I go to say something and it comes out not the way I wanted it to

389
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
But you know what I mean

390
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Maybe I'll start calling you my little lambs

391
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Just as Jesus was a shepherd to us all

392
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
We are not but his sheep

393
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:13,000
His followers, guided by his staff of knowledge and righteousness

394
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Now that you have been cleansed by the holy waters

395
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I suppose I shall wipe you clean

396
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,000
And wipe away the sin from your flesh

397
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Why are you barring?

398
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Is that when my sister has you do, she has you bar for her?

399
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,000
I suppose that's well enough

400
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
She has you bark for her

401
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,000
And they're wondering what she have you do to her

402
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:07,000
I'm well, she probably

403
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Don't mind

404
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Do not say such things

405
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:18,000
That is blasphemous

406
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,000
The scriptures say man cannot lie with an animal

407
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Psalms 23 verse 4

408
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Yes, though I walk through the valley

409
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
And the shadow of death

410
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
I fear no evil

411
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:47,000
For thou art with me, thy rod

412
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
And thy staff, they comfort me

413
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:58,000
I'm waft comforted by God's rod and staff

414
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,000
The staff can be firm, yet gentle

415
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Guiding, nudging us along

416
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
On the path to righteousness

417
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Does that apply to animal folk like me?

418
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:27,000
No, I am only partially animal, I would say

419
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,000
I am mostly human like some of you

420
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Just with some added bonuses

421
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Surely you don't count as an animal despite being funny

422
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Right, this is BB, may we lie with you?

423
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:55,000
I can't believe you would ask such a coarse and lewd thing

424
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:02,000
I'm a sister of the cloth, I lie with no man or woman

425
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Be so kind

426
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
I'm being walked

427
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Sometimes it's more than a nudge

428
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Yes, that is correct

429
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Sometimes it's more like a thrust

430
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:39,000
And a thrust by such a rod

431
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Can bring anyone to a righteous room

432
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
And finish them completely

433
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Wipe away the sand

434
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Wipe away the sand

435
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Wipe away the sand

436
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Wipe away the sand

437
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Wipe away the sand

438
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Wipe away the sea

439
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Wipe away the sand

440
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:35,000
be glassy, be glassy, be glassy

441
00:53:51,000 --> 00:54:19,000
sista, if God doesn't want you to be glassy, then be glassy

442
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:28,000
sista, if God doesn't want me to sin, why did he make you so adorable?

443
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:42,000
if God works in mysterious ways, sweet one, I do not know why God made me this way, but

444
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:55,000
I did to keep my body to him, to worship and love, just as Mary, a holy mother did, I follow

445
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:11,000
and have footsteps. You feel the burden of your sins getting lighter and lighter, lighter,

446
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:35,000
and lighter, lighter, and lighter, lighter, and lighter.

447
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:47,000
How many Hail Mary's and Lord's prayers until I'm forgiven, sista, I do not know what your sin is, sweet one.

448
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:56,000
You must tell me, darling, what you have done, so that I may assign them accordingly.

449
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:14,000
It's a test. There is often a woman placed in front of someone, beautiful, desirable.

450
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:29,000
You may want to indulge in such a woman, but God places these obstacles before you as a test, to test your will.

451
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:35,000
You must find. You must find.

452
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Perhaps it was God's plan for me to be a sinner, so you could cleanse me of yourself. Perhaps I do not know why God does what he does.

453
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:28,000
I only knew as he asked, any place you in front of me, and I will take care of you, and I will save your filthy soul.

454
00:57:43,000 --> 00:58:12,000
My will was broken by your sista. What did she do to you, my dear, that your will was broken?

455
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Even the lowest man can find God.

456
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Sista, I must confess, when I'm with you, I have such lost a lot. Forgive me.

457
00:58:51,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Then I do say to you, brother, turn away from me, do not look upon my figure, if it causes you to stray.

458
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:14,000
I do not mind if you look, but if it stumbles you, I would hate to be the cause.

459
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:29,000
As God has made such beautiful creatures and His creation so that they can be admired.

460
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:38,000
But what if we can't resist because of our love? Love isn't a sin, right?

461
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Of course not, my dear. Love is essential.

462
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Through God's love we were given Jesus Christ to wash away our sins.

463
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:58,000
He gave His only begotten Son for us to save us from ourselves.

464
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:10,000
There is such a righteous love instilled within all of us, and it is important that we use it, whether it be platonically or romantically,

465
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:18,000
because in this God's will that we fill the earth with all its loving worshipers.

466
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Fellow believers, do not confuse the lustful, craving, possessive love in Greek horrors.

467
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:57,000
For God's perfect, unselfish, loving-liners in Greek.

468
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Look on, Barry. That is true, but well.

469
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:11,000
As my sister says, don't get it twisted.

470
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:15,000
No, I will not show you my feet in armpits.

471
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:31,000
I may have to call a priest for you, I think you are too far gone.

472
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Forgive my sin, because I'm coming late to your stream. I'm glad that you came.

473
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Oh sister, I have strayed from our holy ideology. What can I do to come back to the light?

474
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:08,000
I think you misspelled the word ideology, but I will answer the question nonetheless.

475
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:18,000
I'm sorry you have strayed, but you are strong, you are tough, you are one of God's warriors,

476
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:27,000
and he puts you on this earth for a reason, to fight, to fight against evil temptation,

477
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:37,000
to fight against the evil in the world that could destroy us all, but it is only us, true believers,

478
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:45,000
that stand against the devil and put to need to protect his innocent ones.

479
01:02:45,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Take up the holy sword, brother. Use it to slay the wicked, preach God's word, and draw close to him as he draws closer to you.

480
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Sister, why must God give me the hardest tasks, like washing my dear face and making my bed?

481
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Oh, God gives the hardest tasks to his hardened soldiers, of course. Aren't you funny one?

482
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:39,000
You've been instilled with some sort of wit. It is quite humorous.

483
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Blessed be his gifts of love he has bestowed upon me, for I have found true love in one and true friendships in others.

484
01:03:49,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Amen, amen, amen. Beautifully said, beautifully put.

485
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Sister, what if I slay demons by working with demons, like in the hit video game Diablo 4?

486
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Those who are different sorts of demons, so I think you're fine.

487
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:43,000
I do not recommend using or playing works involved with the devil, but again, we are imperfect sinners.

488
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Mother, baby, I'm sister, I'm no mother, but thank you. I hope to become a mother one day, spiritually.

489
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:07,000
I mean, spiritually. Have you ever encountered a demon? How did you survive? How can you fight the supernatural?

490
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Oh, I have quite the story for that. Once upon a time, I was alone in my room. I had just said my nightly prayers.

491
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Sorry, my cat knocked over everything.

492
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Oh my God. I am so sorry.

493
01:05:53,000 --> 01:06:05,000
No, it wasn't even boomy. It was rain and boomy, actually. I need to get a towel, expeditiously.

494
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Oh, wait for this.

495
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Oh, boomy. I'm no catty. Oh, boomy. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

496
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Sorry.

497
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:29,000
You're fine.

498
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Okay. Oh, it's nothing.

499
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:57,000
One of the cats is a giant puffball right now because one of them knocked over my iPad and they spilled my drink all over my mousepad and it's probably going to be broken now.

500
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:05,000
It keeps up the accent in the distance.

501
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Yes, I had a drink and he spilled it everywhere. I might have to get a new mousepad. I'm quite disappointed.

502
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:31,000
The same thing happened on Icy's stream. Oh, that poor heatheness polar bear child thing. That's too bad.

503
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:39,000
No, there's no ribbon glass, don't worry.

504
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:49,000
It's just a wet lemonade stain. It smells good, at least. You, not so much.

505
01:07:49,000 --> 01:08:01,000
I believe Raina was boomy and boomy knocked over my drink. Raina knocked over my trash can and iPad. She knocked my iPad off my desk.

506
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Sending boomy into a tizzy.

507
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:15,000
I knocked over my drink. Let's see if she broke my iPad.

508
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Did she break it? No, she didn't. Okay, that's all I care about. I don't feel like spending another $600 on an iPad, although I've had this one for a couple of years, but it's fine.

509
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:37,000
It's gotten its use, but I would rather not get rid of it so quickly.

510
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Just in the words, I'm sorry, that's all I can say.

511
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:59,000
The strong is this devilish succubus, this Icy is a heathen. I think I saw something about Imi. She is also a worker of the devil practicing spiritualism.

512
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Terrible acts. Azura claims to be a false god. It's terrible.

513
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:16,000
And Massey. Massey is spiritually disturbed. She needs Jesus.

514
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:28,000
iPad and a monastery. It's so easy to have my Bible on my iPad. I don't know what you're talking about. I can take it with me so I don't have to bring the Bible from the church to my home.

515
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Not that I don't have a paper Bible. I've quite a few. Very multiple editions, actually.

516
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:52,000
I think she is an agent of Satan. You can't see, but I just did the cross.

517
01:09:52,000 --> 01:10:03,000
I don't think that cat will be coming back from some time. He seemed quite frightened. I feel a little bad.

518
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Sister, I have a confession to make. I enjoy my spaghetti with ketchup rather than pasta sauce. Please forgive my transgressions.

519
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:28,000
The Italians will kill you. Not in Minecraft. The iPad was not blessed with holy water, no.

520
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Sorry. I don't even remember what I was talking about. Oops, I'm going bigger. Excuse me.

521
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Oh, I was talking about one of the interactions I've had with the devil, with demons.

522
01:10:54,000 --> 01:11:00,000
You're sleeping with that vicious skin.

523
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:08,000
I'd like to know your location. I love Assassin's Creed.

524
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Anyways, let me start my story over. Let me make the Gregorian chant a little louder. Just so God can heal, I must protect myself as I say this.

525
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Even my sister, I know, has worked alongside the devil. I do not doubt it. I do not doubt she sold her soul to rise in power at this Wonderland hotel.

526
01:11:49,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Once upon a time, at night, I was lying in my bed, having just said my nightly prayers, praying for everyone's souls, and for forgiveness of my own transgressions.

527
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:33,000
I heard a knock at the door. I asked who was there. I hadn't expected any company at this time of night. No one answered me. I heard the knock again.

528
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:47,000
I rose from my bed, in my rose, my nightgown, and opened the door to my bedroom. A great wind rushed in.

529
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:27,000
I stood, cold, in shock. I could be not such a draft in my home. It would be impossible. I should have never opened the door, for I believe the devil himself came in.

530
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:39,000
I heard a dark voice call from a corner, aching in the back of my mind.

531
01:13:39,000 --> 01:14:03,000
You are mine, sister. You are mine forever. Even one god, he cannot have came for me. The voice shook me to my core.

532
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Much of her ran down my spine. The Lord is with me. I whispered, clutching my cross closely to my chest. Your Lord cannot protect you now.

533
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:57,000
I was thrown onto my bed. My clothes ripped. A pressure found itself winding up my legs, to my core, to my belly, to my chest, to my throat.

534
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:25,000
I was frozen in shock. This pressure was on top of me. Everywhere I could not breathe. I did not have the voice to scream. I could not move. It was as if my hands and my legs were bound.

535
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:53,000
I prayed silently in my head to the Lord. The voice laughed at me, as if it could read my mind. In them, I cannot speak of what happened next.

536
01:15:53,000 --> 01:16:21,000
It is too much. I was overwrought with sin. My fingers moved as if controlled by this entity. I will not tell you what I did. It is too shameful.

537
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:47,000
I am sorry to burden you with such a story. Do not worry from my soul. I have cleansed myself appropriately.

538
01:16:51,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Do not fret. I think it is time we read some of your confessions.

539
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:36,000
I will not tell you what I did.

540
01:17:51,000 --> 01:18:09,000
I will only be reading what I deemed to be safe for work, as my sister calls it.

541
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Forgive me, Sister Bibi, for I have sinned. I have had no dreams about Shibi Kanban, my sister, like waking up in bed before her and going to make breakfast, only to be held in bed by her not wanting to wake up.

542
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:41,000
To then use the cat as a place to hunt her like an Indiana Jones, and then bring some breakfast to her in bed so we can cuddle.

543
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:58,000
I think that is quite sweet actually, as long as you dream of being married during this, I think you are okay.

544
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:11,000
I confess pineapple on pizza is okay sometimes, but only sometimes.

545
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:25,000
I also confess that the A10 Warthog Thunderbolt 2 goes bird smelly face. I don't know what that is.

546
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Sister, can you marry? No, I have taken a vow of chastity.

547
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:55,000
I actually like pineapple on pizza. I think it's a nice mixture of savory and sweet when done appropriately, so I will agree with this person when I say sometimes and only sometimes.

548
01:19:55,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Mother Bibi, I am a sister. I am not Abbas. I am struggling a lot with temptation. Is it true that pain can help with dominating lust?

549
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Could you help this poor soul by cleansing it with ritual flagellation? I wish you to straighten my back. Thank you for listening to my confession.

550
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:36,000
I will do this for you, my poor soul. Towards the end of this stream, I will take my whip and move shall all progress in an act of self-flagellation.

551
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:53,000
To atone for all the sins that you may have committed, or may be committing as I speak, for right now.

552
01:20:53,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Next one says, I work for YouTube and I made a terrible mistake. I can't tell a rat from a loon scene. Is there any help for me, or am I a reprobate that is going to hell?

553
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:31,000
I'm so sorry, but I cannot save you. You are simply going to hell for confusing that. To disrespect God's creatures with assuming an act of ludeness had taken place. There is no help for you.

554
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:40,000
The ultimate question, sister, do you know the Lord's prayer? Yes.

555
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Our Father, your art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done, as in heaven and earth.

556
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:04,000
There's more than that, but I don't feel like reciting the whole thing.

557
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Whenever I look at you, I am overwhelmed by impure desires. I desire that you would do unspeakable things to me, things that would make even the Spanish Inquisition look tame, and I think I deserve them all because I am a sinner.

558
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Hello. I am quite flushed right now. I don't know what to say to that. I do not know why I cause so many men to sin. I apologize, but I cannot change who I am.

559
01:22:55,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Maybe I should remove myself so that you are not tempted by my body.

560
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:25,000
I will do these things to you. I feel like you have a lot to repent for. I shall make sure we have a session at the blue website after this stream to make sure that you can attend for your sins.

561
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:57,000
I feel that had a fellow woman of the cloth not intervened in kindergarten, I would have grown into the son of Satan himself.

562
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:10,000
It's the only case of corporal punishment I know that appears to have worked as advertised. I've been a good boy, or a lesser evil one ever since that day.

563
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:27,000
I have come to confess that my soul still feels guilty to this day, and I fear that the punishment may have not been enough. I fear that the beast I could have been and probably am still may return one day.

564
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Why does that sound like the back of a book you pull off the shelf in a fiction aisle?

565
01:24:34,000 --> 01:25:01,000
My sweet dear sinner, I think you should give yourself more credit. You are already self aware about the negative machinations of the devil. All you must do, my sweet sinner, is avoid what could cause you to stray from his light.

566
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:25,000
I am not here to confess my sins, but to confess my love. Sister Bebe, will you marry me?

567
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:37,000
Oh my dear, I am sorry, but I can do no such thing. I am pledged to a lord in my virtue with him.

568
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:48,000
I apologise, but I am sure you will find a good Christian girl that can take care of you and all of your needs.

569
01:25:49,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Madam Shebe, is that you? No, my sweet. I am Sister Bebe. I am Shebe's sister, actually her twin sister. Oh, the cat has come back. Hello. I think you have one they call Boomi.

570
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Are you done being scared, little Boomi? Come on, you can lie in the bed.

571
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:23,000
I will save all of your souls.

572
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Sister Bebe, I have a confession to make. I am afraid I am guilty of the sins of lust. You see, I have been losting after Madam Shebe since meeting her.

573
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:48,000
I often think of worshipping this woman in partaking in unspeakable acts with her. Even now, I have an overwhelming desire to pleasure her.

574
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:57,000
I fear that I am being overcome with a bounding love. Do you think I can be given, Sister?

575
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Of course, again, dear sinner, you can be forgiven. Love is no sin. It is what you act upon outside the vows of marriage that is a sin.

576
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:30,000
You may think about it, you may linger, but not too long. It is interesting to me that many of you would think of my sister this way.

577
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:41,000
I am reading this from Marshmallows. The link is on my Sister Shebe's profile.

578
01:27:41,000 --> 01:28:00,000
You must find something to distract you, something that brings you equal pleasure, and then, perhaps, pray.

579
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Hopefully, the distraction in the fervent reading of God's Word will help you abstain from such thoughts.

580
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:37,000
I'm sorry, Mummy, I've been bad. I keep having impure thoughts about Madam Shebe. Why are you all talking about my sister? I don't understand.

581
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:56,000
What does my sister do to you all? Is my sister a sucky bitch? Is she working for the devil? I may have to look into this if so many of you are within her thrall. It is very weird to me, very odd.

582
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Of course, you all can be saved, my dear Synon. You must welcome in Christ, and then you can be truly saved. Turn towards Him. Dedicate yourself to the Lord.

583
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:31,000
May I hearth your sister's hand in marriage? That is up for her to decide, to be honest with you. You know she is someone who have a mind of her own.

584
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Dear Miss Bebe, I master at least once a day every day. I'm sorry for the similar flash. How may I reduce my sinning?

585
01:29:45,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Any time you go to reach for yourself, you must reach for your Bible instead, and look upon His Word, and I will give you a scripture as an example to reflect on, my dear Synon.

586
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:31,000
I wish I had my actual Bible with me, because then you would be able to hear the page turning, but I don't have that, it is at my relative's house.

587
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:51,000
You can hear my nails tap on my holy iPad.

588
01:30:51,000 --> 01:31:00,000
I will read for you 1 Corinthians 6 verses 18-20.

589
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:36,000
You are not your own, you are bought at a price, therefore honour God with your bodies.

590
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:49,000
I will expand upon this with Matthew chapter 5, 27 verses 28. It seems a lot of you may need this scripture.

591
01:31:49,000 --> 01:32:04,000
You have heard that it was said you shall not commit adultery, but I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.

592
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:13,000
So you have a lot of Hail Marys to do for that.

593
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:29,000
I will expand with Romans chapter 13 verse 14. Rather, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not think about how to gratify the desires of the flesh.

594
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:42,000
You must meditate upon Jesus instead to fight these desires. That is the only way, Synon.

595
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Yes, it is still adultery, do not look at women, bad.

596
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:23,000
1 Thessalonians chapter 4 verses 3-4. It is God's will that you should be sanctified, that you should avoid sexual immorality, that each of you should learn to control your own body in a way that is holy and honourable.

597
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:50,000
Do not pervert the ways of the Lord with your lustful thoughts. Turn away from these things that would cause you to stray in sin.

598
01:33:50,000 --> 01:34:08,000
God help us their pictures of women. That's why you should not be on social media. How could you not fall into temptation? You must remove yourself from social media sites. It is God's will.

599
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:24,000
I am so sorry that you were assaulted by pizza. Is never having intercourse also a sin? No. It is a holy thing to reserve yourself for God, to remain impure.

600
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:41,000
Think of the Virgin Mary. Think of those who never did commit the act of sexual gratification. They are raised as saints and canonised.

601
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:59,000
For the holiness in you too, shall be looked upon God and favoured for your holy dedication to do what's right.

602
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:15,000
But sister, YouTube is technically social media, does that mean you have to close the stream as well? If I make you stumble then yes, but if not, it is difficult actually, because social media can also be used to spread God's word.

603
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:30,000
But this YouTube social media is really just a video hosting site, isn't it? Maybe. Because there's comments, a comment section, and you can engage with me. Forget it.

604
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Ezekiel 2320.

605
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
I forgot about the scripture.

606
01:35:49,000 --> 01:36:08,000
Let me read it. Ezekiel 23, verse 26. Wait, I'll make you the full chapter, because now I'm interested.

607
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Oh.

608
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:39,000
There's a whole chapter just about prostitution. The two adulterous sisters. This is very reminiscent of my own two sisters.

609
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Verse 19 says,

610
01:36:52,000 --> 01:37:13,000
Yet, she became more and more promiscuous as she recalled the days of her youth when she was a prostitute in Egypt. There, she lost it after her lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of horses. So you longed for the lewdness of your youth when in Egypt your bosom was caressed and your young breasts fondled.

611
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Go forth and be plentiful. Of course, that is a goal, but you must do it the right way.

612
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Honestly, this seems like a good chapter. I might have to meditate and reflect on this chapter. Maybe I should have my sister read this.

613
01:37:43,000 --> 01:38:09,000
I'm probably in Egypt as built different. My sister might be tempted. Never. Never tempted.

614
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:13,960
It can be something so lustful for dominant women.

615
01:38:13,960 --> 01:38:16,120
Ugh, you are a man.

616
01:38:16,120 --> 01:38:25,480
Why do you lust for dominant women, dominant women undermine their man's headship?

617
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:35,280
Do you not be swayed by the unnatural order of things?

618
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:36,280
How do we even do that?

619
01:38:36,280 --> 01:38:57,800
I've heard there are ways there are some supplements you can take, but you haven't heard it from me.

620
01:38:57,800 --> 01:39:01,800
That's the best part though.

621
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:04,760
Maybe I will have to see for myself.

622
01:39:04,760 --> 01:39:09,560
I do not know what you speak of.

623
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:33,560
Here's the short hand of this called a Domi Nomi Hosei, chapter one, two, then three.

624
01:39:33,560 --> 01:39:52,760
When the Lord began to speak through Hosei, the Lord said to him, go, marry a promiscuous

625
01:39:52,760 --> 01:39:57,640
woman and have children with her, for like an adulterous wife, this land is guilty of

626
01:39:57,640 --> 01:40:00,040
unfaithfulness to the Lord.

627
01:40:00,040 --> 01:40:07,800
So he married Goma, daughter of Dia Balam, and she conceived and bore him a son.

628
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:17,520
Again, when you read scripture, you have to read the context of what's happening, because

629
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:22,360
it seems like the context for this was that he had no other options.

630
01:40:22,360 --> 01:40:32,360
The whole land was unfaithful, there was only harlots around.

631
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:37,440
Because if you look at verse six, Goma conceives again and give birth to a daughter, then the

632
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:43,720
Lord said to Hosei, call her low from Ruhama, which means not loved, for I will no longer

633
01:40:43,720 --> 01:40:47,400
show love to Israel, and I should all forgive them.

634
01:40:47,400 --> 01:40:52,800
He was just having a bad day with them.

635
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:57,200
It just doesn't, he had already forsaken them, so he was like, I don't care what you do,

636
01:40:57,200 --> 01:41:01,720
do whatever, give them all these crappy names.

637
01:41:01,720 --> 01:41:06,760
Because then he had another son, and they named him Lohami, which means not my people.

638
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:10,560
God was just going off on this family, he's like, I just don't like you, you keep having

639
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:20,560
kids, keep naming these terrible things.

640
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:24,680
Yes, except when it's inconvenient.

641
01:41:24,680 --> 01:41:30,880
Who cares about convenience when it's the word of the Lord?

642
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:47,040
Okay, let me look at more marshmallows.

643
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:49,400
Sister Bibi, I need your help.

644
01:41:49,400 --> 01:41:53,360
After spending about two months with your sister, Shibi, I cannot stop thinking about

645
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:59,200
what, sometimes I have been thinking, but you thought, I'm being redundant at this point,

646
01:41:59,200 --> 01:42:01,080
you've heard me what I've said before.

647
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:03,920
Stop thinking of me, they're my sister, and these dirty matters.

648
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:09,360
What do I have to do to convince you otherwise?

649
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:19,200
The Bible says we can buy a doll with some cattle and goats.

650
01:42:19,200 --> 01:42:27,400
Of course, there are things that are outdated in that do not apply to our current time.

651
01:42:27,400 --> 01:42:43,280
They're still applicable, and you just have to find their contemporary meanings.

652
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:49,160
Forgive me, sister, for I have sinned, I have engaged in carnal pleasures with a certain

653
01:42:49,160 --> 01:42:59,360
bunny woman, what makes my sin even worse is the fact she was in the none of it, what?

654
01:42:59,360 --> 01:43:03,720
The act was very blasphemous, but the worst act of all was when she wiped my seed with

655
01:43:03,720 --> 01:43:06,280
her habit.

656
01:43:06,280 --> 01:43:10,760
Please forgive me, give me penance and free my soul of this sin.

657
01:43:10,760 --> 01:43:17,120
Who was this, it was the sister of my church, I would have to speak with her.

658
01:43:17,120 --> 01:43:20,200
That is absolutely disgusting.

659
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:26,040
I'm so sorry she took advantage of you, clearly she's not a true woman of the cloth, she has

660
01:43:26,040 --> 01:43:33,040
taken her vestments in vain.

661
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:38,520
Sister BB, I broken spaghetti in half before cooking, I can't have salad, again, the Italians

662
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:43,120
are the only ones that can absolve you, you will be murdered for your insolence, I cannot

663
01:43:43,120 --> 01:43:44,120
help you there.

664
01:43:44,480 --> 01:43:54,480
That is not the act of the devil, that is the act of a hatefulness, that is a hatecrime

665
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:59,480
against the Italian.

666
01:43:59,480 --> 01:44:06,000
The next one, I lost my virginity in an expensive soap land in Japan, great experience, but

667
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:14,000
was this a sin, forgive me sister BB, I don't know what a soap land is.

668
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:23,880
Again, it is a sin, when you have sexual relations outside of marriage, then it is a sin, I cannot

669
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:27,880
believe you.

670
01:44:27,880 --> 01:44:33,880
You know there is this one verse in the bible that says he wept and I went half-same.

671
01:44:33,880 --> 01:44:40,880
It is good to let out your emotions, God has cried for us many a time, why do you think

672
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:43,960
he gave his son?

673
01:44:43,960 --> 01:44:49,960
Okay, forgive me sister BB for I have sinned, it has been twenty-two years since my last

674
01:44:49,960 --> 01:44:50,960
confession.

675
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:57,960
Oh well, I had impure thoughts about a relative she be laying down with the...

676
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:05,880
I cannot read the rest of this, this is atrocious, I, you are damned to hell for this comment,

677
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:12,880
I can't even read this, why would you say such a thing?

678
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:19,880
Lying down with a what, a beat I can't even, there is like two more sentences to this,

679
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:28,000
you are destined for hell, there is no saving your soul, you are lost.

680
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:36,000
It lets me refresh the page, one of you sent the same thing multiple times, I also can't

681
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:43,000
read this one either, well, that's terrible, oh my God, I have read this multiple times,

682
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:13,000
I'll read some of these on blue website, how about that, because I, oh my God, chat reflects

683
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:25,080
a streamer, I don't know what my sister has been up to, but forgive me sister BB for I

684
01:46:28,240 --> 01:46:35,240
have sinned, I pretended to be mute to not talk to someone, oh, you know, I don't know

685
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:43,000
actions speak louder than words my dears, sometimes it is better to hold our tongue

686
01:46:44,920 --> 01:46:50,000
than to waggle it and say something that we do not mean, I say that you are forgiven

687
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:57,000
for such things, is BDSM a sin if I'm married, I do not know what this BDSM is, BDSM, BDSM,

688
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:05,000
BDSM, BDSM, I don't know, sister BB, I really need your help, every time I come to church

689
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:18,760
on Sunday and see you, my pants get really tight and my crotch gets really hot, I can't

690
01:47:19,480 --> 01:47:26,480
read this, I, I, I, what is happening, I, I, I am sorry that you feel this way, you

691
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:33,480
should probably see a doctor, sister, I am in love with a very sweet girl and sometimes

692
01:47:34,260 --> 01:47:41,260
it borders on insanity, I need her every waking moment, I try to temper my thoughts but she

693
01:47:41,260 --> 01:47:48,260
consumes them, again remember that when you think of a woman you are committing adultery,

694
01:47:48,260 --> 01:47:55,260
you must fill your thoughts instead of the Lord instead of this woman that plagues you,

695
01:47:55,260 --> 01:48:02,260
sister BB, can you help out to poor soul, there is this woman that you are committing adultery,

696
01:48:02,260 --> 01:48:09,260
you must fill your thoughts instead of the Lord instead of this woman that plagues you,

697
01:48:09,260 --> 01:48:16,260
sister BB, can you help out to poor soul, there is this woman that you are committing adultery,

698
01:48:25,260 --> 01:48:30,580
attempts me into sin, she has a very wet mouth and the shells she makes with it are driving

699
01:48:30,580 --> 01:48:36,340
my mortal flesh away from God, how does one resist the wet mouth, I feel like I know who

700
01:48:36,340 --> 01:48:43,340
you speak of, I have run into this woman before, she is quite the seductress herself, her words

701
01:48:45,260 --> 01:48:52,260
on her lips are honey, I do not blame you brother but it will be a hard fight, hmmm,

702
01:48:55,260 --> 01:49:01,260
you must resist her, you must be strong, you must avoid her at all costs, or you will be

703
01:49:01,260 --> 01:49:11,260
lost like all the others, is this a good idea, you madam's male, it's fine, don't worry about

704
01:49:11,260 --> 01:49:26,260
it, alright, a lot of these are stuff that I cannot read, well, guys I said I would be

705
01:49:26,260 --> 01:49:34,260
doing this on YouTube, I don't understand, okay, oh sister I have heard your plight with

706
01:49:34,260 --> 01:49:40,260
the demons, for a very low payment of four twenty dollars and sixty nine cents will bring

707
01:49:40,260 --> 01:49:46,260
in the demon hunter expert Sam and Dean Winchester to exercise the demons, Chevy and Pollard cost

708
01:49:46,260 --> 01:49:52,260
extra, demon hunter ink is not liable for any physical, mental, emotional, spiritual and

709
01:49:52,260 --> 01:49:57,260
quantum damage caused by the exorcism, I have met these two before, they're quite sweet,

710
01:49:57,260 --> 01:50:03,260
I did not like them that much though, I would not hire them again, they blew up the last

711
01:50:03,260 --> 01:50:18,260
chapel I was in, I almost, ugh, didn't make it, my dear sister, be aware that when you

712
01:50:18,260 --> 01:50:23,260
walk into the house of blue it is filled with demons and your faith will be tested, your

713
01:50:23,260 --> 01:50:27,260
every desire will be tended to, you will say a word, you only think your most tempting

714
01:50:27,260 --> 01:50:32,260
thoughts, you might walk out of there corrupted, and if so you will be in utter bliss, so if

715
01:50:32,260 --> 01:50:36,260
you believe your faith is strong come see us from this house of blue, you'll be eagerly

716
01:50:36,260 --> 01:50:43,260
waiting, I've heard of this house of blue, I must see it for myself, I must go, I think

717
01:50:43,260 --> 01:50:48,260
there are many sheep without a shepherd there that I must guide to Jesus, and I will do

718
01:50:48,260 --> 01:50:59,260
so, sister baby for the past many nights I have been plagued with impure thoughts of your

719
01:50:59,260 --> 01:51:05,260
sister when I've given myself to another, I've dreamt many dreams of our bodies intermingling,

720
01:51:05,260 --> 01:51:10,260
I deserve punishment, but I fear the law, I love the painful pleasure of a whip or paddle

721
01:51:10,260 --> 01:51:21,260
against my skin, you are an adulterer and a philanderer, these things will not absolve

722
01:51:21,260 --> 01:51:31,260
you, self-flagellation will not bring you mercy, pardon the pun, I can't, if why do

723
01:51:31,260 --> 01:51:37,260
you look upon my sister if you have given yourself to another, it is either you dedicate

724
01:51:37,260 --> 01:51:46,260
yourself to both, to none or to one, sister how does one atone for burning another church,

725
01:51:46,260 --> 01:51:54,260
you've burned more than one, BDSM, Blessings, Devotion, Service and Mercy, oh okay, I participate

726
01:51:54,260 --> 01:52:06,260
in BDSM then, you can fully display it, I believe so too, I think your sins need to be on full

727
01:52:06,260 --> 01:52:24,260
display, what, I played with my rabbit's lob ears, she was fine with it, but I did feel

728
01:52:24,260 --> 01:52:36,260
a little rude considering, that's fine, as long as the bunny can sense, then you were fine,

729
01:52:36,260 --> 01:52:42,260
sister baby, I've never known a woman, and at this point I think I'm losing it, some days

730
01:52:42,260 --> 01:52:51,260
on the weekends I get to the double digits, handling it myself, the double digits, most

731
01:52:51,260 --> 01:52:54,260
nights I don't even get to sleep if I don't, but the worst if it is, I just want someone

732
01:52:54,260 --> 01:52:59,260
to hold, you have a daemon, there is a daemon within you, there is a darkness, you must

733
01:52:59,260 --> 01:53:07,260
cast it out, you must be exercised, I will be exercising you all at the house of blue,

734
01:53:07,260 --> 01:53:17,260
that is terrible, I'm so sorry, take a breath, breathe brother, breathe, sister I have a

735
01:53:17,260 --> 01:53:22,260
confession, I did a read your ball at a friend's house, pagan I know, did I invite daemons,

736
01:53:22,260 --> 01:53:26,260
yes you did, I'm so sorry about what you did, you're going to have nightmares for like

737
01:53:26,260 --> 01:53:36,260
three days, you can feel very depressed, you better read the bible, burn some sage or whatever

738
01:53:36,260 --> 01:53:43,260
pagans do to get rid of that, careful with the mic peaking a bit, how about you shot

739
01:53:43,260 --> 01:53:53,260
you on holy mouth, how about that, forgive me sister bb5 sin, last week I spent money

740
01:53:53,260 --> 01:53:58,260
on the gacha game blue archive and spent around 80 dollars, I got what I wanted but I feel

741
01:53:58,260 --> 01:54:10,260
sinful now forgive me sister, it seems you got greedy then, you should have stopped that,

742
01:54:10,260 --> 01:54:16,260
these tithes could have been paid to the church instead of this blue archive, I do not know

743
01:54:16,260 --> 01:54:26,260
what this blue archive is, it sounds most unholy, who did you roll for, that's a great

744
01:54:26,260 --> 01:54:39,260
question, please send me your answer, we're worshipping golden in an un-christian way,

745
01:54:39,260 --> 01:54:44,260
I do not know what this means, how can, what churches were worshipping golden in an un-christian

746
01:54:44,260 --> 01:54:51,260
way that you felt so you had to take upon yourself to set them aflame, dress hyena and

747
01:54:52,260 --> 01:54:57,260
well now you know your answers, I thought you were going to send them anonymously but

748
01:54:57,260 --> 01:55:14,260
never mind, no sticks, alright I think I'm done reading the marrows for now because they

749
01:55:14,260 --> 01:55:27,260
have, I cannot read these, forgive me for I have sinned, I am a weak man and can't bring

750
01:55:27,260 --> 01:55:32,260
myself to be loyal to just one girl, instead I have been acting unwise to all the women

751
01:55:32,260 --> 01:55:43,260
in this corporal, how can I redeem myself, out of character I don't care and nobody else

752
01:55:43,260 --> 01:55:48,260
does either, in character, how could you do such a thing, you must be loyal to one woman,

753
01:55:48,260 --> 01:56:04,260
you put down me to hell if you cannot dedicate yourself to one woman, I do not want to spur

754
01:56:04,260 --> 01:56:11,260
any competitiveness amongst ourselves because it, I'll be honest with you, it genuinely

755
01:56:11,260 --> 01:56:21,260
pains me that some of you feel like you cannot love another, send Scottish for a second, breaks

756
01:56:21,260 --> 01:56:25,260
the fourth wall, I'm doing it again but I'm doing it in my accent because I can't, I can't

757
01:56:25,260 --> 01:56:40,260
read in my accent for some reason, it's really hard to get out of it and give you a soul in your body

758
01:56:40,260 --> 01:56:48,260
and your mind and your spirit over to me instead, sister baby, then you won't have to worry about

759
01:56:48,260 --> 01:57:17,260
any of these feeler whores, proper, affectionately derogatory, oh my god, I can't read this, why

760
01:57:17,260 --> 01:57:28,260
are you guys saying such an holy thing, okay, I think it is time we took this conversation

761
01:57:28,260 --> 01:57:40,260
to the house of blue, say something distinctly on British like I regularly visit a dentist

762
01:57:40,260 --> 01:58:04,260
or this food is a little too bland, well British food is bland, I mean I'm back, I have to use the facilities

763
01:58:04,260 --> 01:58:17,260
I need to use the little nuns room, help me, alright, thank you for coming to my not ASMR ASMR

764
01:58:17,260 --> 01:58:26,260
I'm probably just going to relabel this as a 3D or roleplay rather than ASMR because that's really what it was, it was a 3D or roleplay

765
01:58:26,260 --> 01:58:40,260
so I will change the title as such and yes, my sister is nowhere in the facility, do not speak of her

766
01:58:40,260 --> 01:58:49,260
if I go to the blue website I will continue the accent by the way, the whip, oh that's right, hold on

767
01:58:49,260 --> 01:58:51,260
I need to go get the whip

768
01:58:59,260 --> 01:59:05,260
oh my gosh, I almost forgot, hold on, I need to move this cat because he's going to get scared if I do this

769
01:59:05,260 --> 01:59:13,260
hi baby, excuse me little man, you have to go over here, I do not want you to be scared

770
01:59:18,260 --> 01:59:19,260
alright

771
01:59:22,260 --> 01:59:25,260
it is time for you all to atone

772
01:59:26,260 --> 01:59:34,260
lift up your shirt and turn your backs towards me, you must get lashes for your sins

773
01:59:37,260 --> 01:59:40,260
God bless you all and may you stay in his light

774
01:59:51,260 --> 01:59:52,260
take that

775
01:59:56,260 --> 01:59:57,260
take that

776
02:00:10,260 --> 02:00:13,260
have you had enough, I don't think so yet

777
02:00:15,260 --> 02:00:17,260
oh I just whipped myself

778
02:00:20,260 --> 02:00:22,260
oh that got me right in the teeth

779
02:00:23,260 --> 02:00:24,260
oh my nipple

780
02:00:27,260 --> 02:00:29,260
that was more intense than I thought, okay

781
02:00:31,260 --> 02:00:32,260
don't laugh at me

782
02:00:38,260 --> 02:00:42,260
it's not your place to laugh, stop it right now

783
02:00:42,260 --> 02:00:43,260
no

784
02:00:47,260 --> 02:00:53,260
I am purging my own sins because it was a sin doing the stream

785
02:00:57,260 --> 02:01:00,260
now that's how you break a merchant

786
02:01:02,260 --> 02:01:08,260
why is she going harder than she, well you are clearly in need of God's love

787
02:01:09,260 --> 02:01:15,260
I whipped myself again but it was nice, okay I think that's it, I don't want to

788
02:01:16,260 --> 02:01:19,260
my neighbours are probably like what's happening

789
02:01:39,260 --> 02:01:40,260
alright

790
02:01:41,260 --> 02:01:46,260
may you all be within God's glory and wrapped in his embrace and love furthermore

791
02:01:53,260 --> 02:01:54,260

02:01:55,260 --> 02:01:57,260

794
02:02:08,260 --> 02:02:10,260
