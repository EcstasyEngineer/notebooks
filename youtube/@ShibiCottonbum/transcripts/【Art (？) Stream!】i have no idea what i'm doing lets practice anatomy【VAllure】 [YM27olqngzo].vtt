05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
Did you guys do something wrong?

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
I feel like are you sucking up to me?

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
Yeah, yeah, I don't know if I trust you.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
I don't know, hmm, suspicious.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
You might be wondering why am I holding my leash like this?

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
I'm drawing with it, don't worry about it.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
It's a skill that takes years to master, but I have done so.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
How was the bed?

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
Oh, it was so good.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
Such great bed.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
I'm sorry, I'm eating almonds.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
It was so good.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
I didn't think it would be different.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
Lying on the floor versus lying on a bed frame.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
The leash has a drawing feature.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
It draws you closer to me, so I can choke you out.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
How the almonds activated?

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
What does that mean?

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
There's blue diamond honey roasted almonds.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
Right on the floor of this one.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
It's really good handwriting. Are you lying to me?

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Oh, am I? Okay, great.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
I'm not actually...

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Thank you for the soup, ma'am.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
The only thing I did wrong was staring at your fuzzangas,

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
and I feel no shame.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
One, thank you.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
Two, I didn't know you could thumbs up a soup.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
It's a meme from a cookbook? Oh, okay.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
Yeah, I have really stupid chicken scratch handwriting.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
I think it's pretty. Thank you.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
I think it looks... I like to think that it looks like

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
artsy, quirky, like manic pixie dream girl handwriting.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
You know, like, you know, yeah.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
I'm so happy I finished what I was doing before on time.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
I thought I was going to be late again.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
That wouldn't be the first time.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Yeah, we have an engine drill.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
What's I doing before?

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Umm...

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Just stuff.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
I don't really know.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
It was just... I don't know.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
It took me a while to figure out, like, something...

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
to do.

10:07.640 --> 10:15.040
When I was in middle school and high school or elementary school, I don't know what to call it for you, European friends, but whatever.

10:16.540 --> 10:17.940
I also have some goldfishies.

10:19.240 --> 10:21.140
But I wanted to go for illustration.

10:22.440 --> 10:24.440
I actually wanted to be a comic book artist.

10:25.140 --> 10:28.140
That was when I was really obsessed with Marvel.

10:29.240 --> 10:30.240
I wasn't good.

10:32.640 --> 10:34.540
Excuse me, will you draw one of your old OCs?

10:35.040 --> 10:36.440
That's a good idea.

10:37.040 --> 10:44.240
Although, I mostly had male OCs because I was a very horny teenager, so.

10:45.240 --> 10:46.840
With goldfish, just the regular kind.

10:48.140 --> 10:49.740
Do I have any old drawings or so?

10:50.140 --> 10:51.140
Sadly, no.

10:51.440 --> 10:56.940
My art is lost to the ages.

10:58.240 --> 11:05.040
I wish there was one sketchbook that I did a lot of my art studies.

11:05.040 --> 11:08.040
I had some really good nose studies, hand studies, I remember.

11:09.540 --> 11:10.840
Mouth and eye studies.

11:11.140 --> 11:22.240
And then I loved drawing like, just like figure drawing like masculine and feminine forms like draped over furniture or having stuff draped on them.

11:24.040 --> 11:25.840
But I did used to draw a lot.

11:25.840 --> 11:29.740
But again, I haven't drawn in such a long time.

11:31.040 --> 11:32.940
Hot boy OCs make them kiss.

11:33.040 --> 11:33.940
Trust me, sis.

11:33.940 --> 11:35.140
I made them kiss.

11:37.740 --> 11:40.940
But draw one of your hair.

11:41.840 --> 11:43.540
I don't remember a lot.

11:43.740 --> 11:47.140
I was also never good at like, I only drew like traditionally.

11:47.140 --> 11:48.840
I'm not good at digital art.

11:49.940 --> 11:51.640
I only ever drew traditionally.

11:51.940 --> 11:58.440
I think I might have like some old deviant art full of like warrior cat OCs.

11:58.740 --> 11:59.740
But I don't know.

11:59.740 --> 12:01.440
I can't remember what the name of it is.

12:02.640 --> 12:03.640
Could you draw a crowd?

12:03.640 --> 12:04.540
Of course I could.

12:04.540 --> 12:05.340
Aren't you here?

12:05.540 --> 12:07.040
Aren't you all here right now?

12:08.540 --> 12:10.040
Who is Legolius?

12:12.040 --> 12:14.340
I mean Legolius and Danny Phantom.

12:16.740 --> 12:24.440
But yeah, so I'm like, like Emmy and Azura have inspired me to like practice drawing more.

12:25.540 --> 12:30.640
Cause I'm, you know, like how powerful you are when you can draw yourself as a VTuber.

12:30.740 --> 12:33.040
I'm like, I could draw the craziest shit.

12:33.440 --> 12:35.240
But I can't do that right now.

12:35.640 --> 12:38.040
I'm not drawing crazy shit for the stream.

12:38.340 --> 12:42.040
But like in the future, it would be cool if I could.

12:42.640 --> 12:45.040
I also want to learn like color theory and stuff.

12:45.040 --> 12:46.440
Cause I never colored.

12:46.440 --> 12:53.540
I only like painted and did like pastels, like chalk pastels and wax pastels.

12:55.040 --> 12:55.940
I'm trying to think what else.

12:58.040 --> 13:02.440
I'm like looking over, cause like I have a sketchbook, but I never drew in it.

13:03.540 --> 13:05.740
I bought a sketchbook like I'm going to draw again.

13:05.940 --> 13:07.740
Like months ago did not draw on it.

13:09.940 --> 13:11.440
She'd be drawing herself for the certified.

13:11.440 --> 13:11.840
Yes.

13:12.340 --> 13:16.740
Um, but I wish I really wish I kept up with that skill, especially now being a VTuber.

13:17.640 --> 13:21.640
They always say being an artist is a useless skill.

13:21.640 --> 13:23.740
That's not fucking true in VTubing.

13:23.740 --> 13:24.940
It's a great skill.

13:25.240 --> 13:30.040
My goal would be, it would be really cool to become a VTuber mama for someone.

13:30.340 --> 13:32.540
Um, although I know what goes into that.

13:32.540 --> 13:33.340
It's not just the art.

13:33.340 --> 13:36.240
You also have to know how to cut it up and separate layers and do all that shit.

13:36.540 --> 13:38.840
Um, but it would be cool to learn that stuff.

13:38.940 --> 13:42.740
Um, but for now we're just going to practice our anatomy.

13:43.340 --> 13:43.840
Um.

13:47.740 --> 13:48.340
Sippy sip.

13:49.240 --> 13:50.540
Um, thank you to you guys.

13:50.540 --> 13:57.040
Um, I put a tablet on my throne like when I first started cause I did, you know, anticipate

13:57.340 --> 13:58.840
wanting to do a drawing stream.

13:59.440 --> 14:05.040
Um, but, uh, so thank you for all your support.

14:05.140 --> 14:10.240
There's a, you guys don't understand how happy I get when you guys give me a gift

14:10.240 --> 14:11.140
for my throne.

14:11.940 --> 14:15.440
So my, um, I haven't gone downstairs yet to go get it.

14:15.440 --> 14:19.240
Sorry, I'm putting my tablet on my desk and moving stuff out of the way.

14:19.240 --> 14:20.640
Maybe I should get like a tablet stand.

14:21.140 --> 14:28.440
Um, but like my vacuum was delivered and you guys don't know, I'm like, wow, I am

14:28.440 --> 14:29.740
truly a hag.

14:29.740 --> 14:37.640
If I'm so excited to have a vacuum, I'm like, yes, I have a bed frame.

14:37.740 --> 14:39.140
Yes, I have a vacuum.

14:39.240 --> 14:40.940
Now I can really suck.

14:43.640 --> 14:46.140
It's just, it's, I'm so hag maxing.

14:46.140 --> 14:47.640
It's, it's ridiculous.

14:48.040 --> 14:52.140
Um, but cause my other one is like really cheap.

14:52.140 --> 14:56.340
I want to go off of Amazon and it broke and my cats kick litter everywhere

14:56.340 --> 14:58.740
with their little stinky little litter paws.

14:58.740 --> 15:03.040
So I'm probably, I'm going to get a leave after stream, go downstairs to my

15:03.040 --> 15:06.940
mail room and get that and dance the night away cleaning my house because

15:06.940 --> 15:08.140
that's how messed up I am.

15:10.540 --> 15:11.140
Okay.

15:11.340 --> 15:12.240
Let me see.

15:12.240 --> 15:14.040
I just want to make sure everything is.

15:22.340 --> 15:24.940
Did you enjoy your pre stream almonds?

15:25.340 --> 15:26.440
Hope the stream goes well.

15:26.440 --> 15:28.740
Thank you for the tip of day.

15:30.040 --> 15:31.940
Yeah, my almonds are very tasty.

15:32.440 --> 15:34.740
Um, dancing in the mail.

15:34.740 --> 15:35.740
No, shut up.

15:36.740 --> 15:37.840
Shut up, dude.

15:38.540 --> 15:46.940
Um, the postal mail room, you fucking dweeb.

15:47.340 --> 15:48.740
I'm trying to put my headphones on.

15:48.740 --> 15:49.040
What?

15:49.340 --> 15:52.840
I have like a chunk of cat hair in my headphones.

15:53.840 --> 15:54.940
Okay.

15:57.740 --> 15:59.940
Um, I got paint tool sigh.

15:59.940 --> 16:03.040
I also used to draw on paint tool sigh, but I don't remember how to.

16:03.040 --> 16:04.640
Is there a way so that you guys can?

16:04.640 --> 16:05.040
Okay.

16:05.040 --> 16:06.640
You guys can see my cursor.

16:07.040 --> 16:07.640
Cool.

16:07.640 --> 16:09.440
So yeah, welcome.

16:09.440 --> 16:11.240
Wow.

16:12.840 --> 16:14.440
I can't hear my own music.

16:23.040 --> 16:23.640
Good.

16:24.240 --> 16:27.340
That's some good good good background.

16:28.240 --> 16:28.840
No, no, no.

16:28.840 --> 16:30.240
Don't give him attention.

16:30.440 --> 16:31.540
Don't give him attention.

16:31.540 --> 16:32.840
Pay attention to me.

16:36.440 --> 16:36.640
Okay.

16:36.640 --> 16:38.140
Yeah, I was like, it was too quiet.

16:38.140 --> 16:38.840
I realized.

16:43.140 --> 16:45.740
What would you listen to watch when you used to draw more?

16:45.740 --> 16:51.040
Um, I was a little emo bitch and so I would either just watch like anime or I

16:51.040 --> 16:59.140
would just listen to really like MSI and mine and what's it called?

16:59.640 --> 17:06.340
Um, Hollywood on dad and be like, oh, I hate my life.

17:06.640 --> 17:09.740
If only there were these people that were real.

17:10.040 --> 17:10.340
Okay.

17:10.340 --> 17:14.640
So I'll tell you like who my who some of my OCs were.

17:15.440 --> 17:20.540
Um, I had a lot of soul leader OCs bus Hollywood on dad album.

17:20.540 --> 17:21.040
Oh, that's hard.

17:21.040 --> 17:21.240
Hold on.

17:21.240 --> 17:26.340
I have to look up what they look like because I usually only go by album art.

17:26.340 --> 17:28.040
I never remember album names.

17:28.640 --> 17:32.240
Hello and then album.

17:36.040 --> 17:37.340
No, not the who.

17:45.340 --> 17:47.740
No, not Hollywood albums.

17:47.740 --> 17:48.840
Jesus fuck.

17:49.240 --> 17:50.640
Ah, swan songs.

17:51.640 --> 17:54.240
Although I did like notes from the, oh wait, but American tragedy.

17:55.340 --> 17:58.440
I haven't listened to any of like their newer stuff.

18:01.440 --> 18:02.840
Because what was our newest thing?

18:03.440 --> 18:08.040
I don't even, you haven't listened to a new empire or day of the dead.

18:10.840 --> 18:12.040
Born here's a who.

18:12.240 --> 18:15.440
No, my actually didn't listen to my chemical romance growing up.

18:15.540 --> 18:16.440
I really didn't.

18:19.840 --> 18:22.840
If it's anything but American tragedy, I won't cry.

18:23.440 --> 18:25.040
Um, new EP's are good.

18:25.040 --> 18:25.340
Okay.

18:26.340 --> 18:27.440
I'm able to change your marks.

18:27.440 --> 18:28.440
Oh, yay.

18:28.440 --> 18:28.940
Good.

18:30.940 --> 18:32.040
But um, yeah.

18:32.040 --> 18:37.440
So, uh, so I had like my, let me see, I'll try to draw her.

18:37.440 --> 18:40.940
So I had my OC who was a self insert.

18:41.040 --> 18:44.640
I need to, I don't know how to use this tablet, but I know there's a zoom feature.

18:45.340 --> 18:46.440
Is there, is that how you do it?

18:47.440 --> 18:47.640
No.

18:47.640 --> 18:48.240
Oh, fuck.

18:48.240 --> 18:50.240
I'm zooming on the chat.

18:53.440 --> 18:53.840
Okay.

18:55.040 --> 18:57.740
Um, I don't know how to use paint tool side either.

18:58.640 --> 19:01.240
So, uh, her name was Kiri.

19:05.040 --> 19:06.240
Or Kiritan.

19:06.440 --> 19:10.240
I don't, I can't remember the last name I gave her.

19:10.340 --> 19:15.640
I'd have to like go back and look at like, oh wow, this is so pixelated because

19:15.640 --> 19:21.740
the thing, we can't even see what you can't even see what I'm drawing.

19:23.740 --> 19:24.340
Hold on.

19:30.240 --> 19:33.440
Um, Jesus, fuck.

19:33.440 --> 19:36.440
I don't know how to, I didn't know how to like properly capture this.

19:37.540 --> 19:42.240
So Kiri, uh, she was my master OC.

19:42.840 --> 19:45.640
Let me see how big is this?

19:45.640 --> 19:46.240
That's pretty big.

19:47.940 --> 20:01.540
Um, and she was like typical, like Japanese school girl outfit from what I can remember.

20:01.940 --> 20:04.440
Um, oh, it's just Kiri.

20:04.440 --> 20:07.640
It's just Kiri and she, it's funny.

20:07.740 --> 20:11.040
Now that I think of it, she has like scrawny's hairstyle.

20:12.040 --> 20:16.740
Cause she had like the bangs and like the little thing.

20:17.540 --> 20:26.340
And then, but then I always gave her, uh, she had two ponytails on top or whatever the fuck.

20:26.340 --> 20:27.440
I'm not like trying hard.

20:27.640 --> 20:32.440
And then I gave her like super long hair on the bottom.

20:33.840 --> 20:40.240
Cause I really liked Tamari from, um, from Naruto.

20:41.040 --> 20:42.340
So Kiri is Scottish.

20:42.540 --> 20:42.840
No.

20:43.140 --> 20:45.540
Um, and she was, she had pink hair.

20:48.240 --> 20:55.240
She had pink hair and I'm trying to, to be honest, I don't think I made her tan.

20:55.240 --> 21:01.840
I think I just made her white cause I didn't have like, I don't think I had any tan OC's not to think about it.

21:02.440 --> 21:10.940
Um, yeah, I don't, I don't know why and she had like blue eyes.

21:11.740 --> 21:13.540
I think I can't remember that much.

21:20.840 --> 21:21.840
But she was pretty chill.

21:21.840 --> 21:23.940
She was kind of a whiny bitch from what I remember.

21:23.940 --> 21:26.940
I just like really made her whiny and she was horny all the time.

21:29.040 --> 21:30.340
Sorry, I heard my neighbor going by.

21:30.340 --> 21:31.440
So that's my pause.

21:33.440 --> 21:35.140
And I remember I gave her freckles.

21:35.140 --> 21:40.940
Um, but yeah, she was, she was, she was chill.

21:41.440 --> 21:42.240
She was cool.

21:44.640 --> 21:44.940
Yeah.

21:44.940 --> 21:49.040
Cause she was a self-insert and I couldn't, I just lived vicariously through her.

21:49.040 --> 21:52.540
I can't even remember the outfit cause I gave her like the, you know, little bo shit.

21:53.040 --> 21:57.040
And then she had like a, oh hello mother.

21:59.240 --> 22:05.340
Um, I drew her in a lot of different outfits, but mostly she was in like a Japanese schoolgirl outfit.

22:05.340 --> 22:12.940
I'll have to like look to check my email and see if, um, there's anything there.

22:13.240 --> 22:15.140
How are you doing reeflings?

22:15.440 --> 22:16.540
How are you doing?

22:17.040 --> 22:19.740
How was time with strongy Elden Ring?

22:19.740 --> 22:22.040
I need to add Elden Ring to my schedule next week.

22:22.640 --> 22:25.540
Um, but yeah, she was chill.

22:25.640 --> 22:28.940
I'm just literally going to lazily have her put her hands on her hips.

22:29.840 --> 22:31.340
Yeah, whatever the fuck you guys get it.

22:31.340 --> 22:32.740
Um, she was cool.

22:33.740 --> 22:36.240
You know, always had to have the thigh highs.

22:36.740 --> 22:38.740
Those were, you know, all the rage.

22:41.740 --> 22:42.740
It looks adorable.

22:43.740 --> 22:45.740
Oh yeah, she was, I loved her a lot.

22:45.740 --> 22:47.240
She was like my pride and joy.

22:47.740 --> 22:57.740
And then she had her, um, I will literally, I remember I drew like a really fucking sick picture of her with her scythe.

22:58.740 --> 23:06.440
Cause her scythe was modeled kind of after Haydn's and she had like the three.

23:07.040 --> 23:08.240
Um, I forget.

23:08.240 --> 23:12.040
I think I had like an, wasn't an eyeball or like a mouth.

23:12.140 --> 23:13.040
I can't remember.

23:13.540 --> 23:16.040
Um, or like three dots.

23:16.140 --> 23:16.740
I can't call.

23:17.040 --> 23:21.640
And then there was my boy, my pride, my joy.

23:22.640 --> 23:27.640
James Sinner, who was a little, wait, I put his bang on the wrong side.

23:29.640 --> 23:36.640
I think every which side it was on and he was, um, yeah, it was definitely the side cause I always put his dots.

23:41.640 --> 23:48.140
And he was, uh, little sick, nasty bro, little meme edge lord.

23:48.140 --> 23:55.640
Uh, he was a ginger and, uh, cause I had a weird fascination with gingers at the time.

23:55.640 --> 23:56.640
I don't know why.

23:57.140 --> 24:04.140
Um, and I usually would just make like fix of him.

24:04.140 --> 24:10.140
And then I had another OC, um, it's a reference to Johnny sins.

24:10.140 --> 24:16.640
No, I like, I don't even know why I like named him Sin.

24:17.140 --> 24:20.140
Cause he just like his real name was James Sinner, but he just went by sin.

24:20.140 --> 24:22.640
And then he had his, he had three beauty marks under his eye.

24:22.640 --> 24:23.640
That was like his thing.

24:24.140 --> 24:29.640
Um, um, so ginger is a size.

24:31.640 --> 24:32.640
Yeah, exactly.

24:32.640 --> 24:33.640
Welcome in.

24:33.640 --> 24:34.640
Welcome in.

24:34.640 --> 24:35.140
Thank you.

24:35.140 --> 24:35.640
Thank you.

24:35.640 --> 24:36.640
Enjoy the emotes.

24:36.640 --> 24:38.640
Um, yeah, he was a major edge lord.

24:39.640 --> 24:45.140
Um, and then I had, uh, zero.

24:45.140 --> 24:50.140
I can't use like an Android and I usually just like, I was in my fujoshi era.

24:50.140 --> 24:53.140
So I literally just make sin in zero.

24:53.140 --> 24:54.640
Just like fuck all the time.

24:58.640 --> 24:59.640
This reminds me of solar.

24:59.640 --> 25:00.140
Yeah.

25:00.140 --> 25:03.140
Cause this is my soul eater OC soul eater.

25:05.140 --> 25:09.640
She was my master and sin was the weapon.

25:09.640 --> 25:13.640
Um, and then I can't remember.

25:13.640 --> 25:17.640
I remember it was very elaborate for zeros here because he also had a fucking

25:18.140 --> 25:20.640
banging and it went like that or some fuck.

25:20.640 --> 25:21.640
I don't fucking know.

25:22.140 --> 25:25.140
Um, and he was like very coup d'etre.

25:26.140 --> 25:27.140
Hello.

25:27.140 --> 25:27.640
Hello.

25:27.640 --> 25:28.640
We all the character was here.

25:28.640 --> 25:29.140
Oh yeah.

25:29.140 --> 25:30.640
His name was zero.

25:30.640 --> 25:32.640
And then you had to do that.

25:33.640 --> 25:35.140
You had to do.

25:35.640 --> 25:36.140
Yeah.

25:36.140 --> 25:39.140
Also I was very like into scenes, scene culture.

25:39.140 --> 25:41.640
So they all had like seen related stuff.

25:42.140 --> 25:45.640
Um, and then there was zero.

25:46.640 --> 25:48.640
My booby itching.

25:49.140 --> 25:51.140
Um, and he was like very coup d'etre.

25:51.140 --> 25:52.640
He like hated his life.

25:52.640 --> 25:57.140
He would like whatever was like, oh gross.

25:57.640 --> 26:04.140
Um, he also, he was albino cause you know, he had to have one OC have white hair and red eyes.

26:04.140 --> 26:05.140
So that's what he was.

26:05.140 --> 26:11.140
Um, and then there was, uh, I had some like teen Titan OC's.

26:11.640 --> 26:16.640
So there was, um, fuck, I think how did his hair go?

26:17.140 --> 26:17.640
Fuck.

26:18.640 --> 26:20.140
Then there was Dante.

26:21.140 --> 26:23.140
I think his hair was like swoopy.

26:24.140 --> 26:27.140
Again, they all had fucking seen hair don't come for me.

26:27.640 --> 26:32.640
And he was like, he could, um, shape shift just like Beast Boy cause I like Beast Boy.

26:33.140 --> 26:34.140
He was cool.

26:35.140 --> 26:38.140
And then his girlfriend was this chick named Addison.

26:38.140 --> 26:41.640
She was just like a normie, but she was like very like preppy.

26:42.640 --> 26:43.640
Yeah.

26:43.640 --> 26:44.640
Raven.

26:45.140 --> 26:53.140
Um, I'm going to laugh hysterically if like my childhood friend that I made all these OC's with like watches this sometime in the future.

26:53.140 --> 26:54.640
And it was like, what the fuck?

26:54.640 --> 26:58.640
Wait, I know these people cause we would role play all the time.

26:58.640 --> 27:02.140
Um, and Addison was like really cute.

27:02.140 --> 27:05.640
She was like your typical preppy girl.

27:05.640 --> 27:06.640
And it's funny.

27:06.640 --> 27:11.640
Oh, by the way, Dante had like, um, black hair and then like a red highlight.

27:14.140 --> 27:17.640
Yeah, Addison, she was sweet.

27:18.140 --> 27:19.140
She was cute.

27:19.140 --> 27:22.140
She usually would have like a bow in her hair, some shit.

27:23.640 --> 27:25.640
And her hair was like blonde and long.

27:26.640 --> 27:34.140
Um, oh, I think I had, remember did Dante have a cool sword?

27:34.140 --> 27:37.640
No, Dante usually would just shape shift into something and try to kill you.

27:37.640 --> 27:39.640
Um, black hair.

27:39.640 --> 27:43.140
Yeah, definitely.

27:43.140 --> 27:53.140
Um, and then I also, cause you guys know I had a fixation with Hikaru and Kauru from Oran High School Host Club cause twincest is twincest.

27:53.640 --> 27:57.640
Um, so I made my own characters named Romeo and Julian.

28:02.140 --> 28:03.640
And they were toys.

28:07.640 --> 28:12.640
And they were just, you know, pretty much a copy of Hikaru and Kauru.

28:12.640 --> 28:14.640
Um, I can't remember what their hair was.

28:14.640 --> 28:19.640
I think like one had like hair going up and then one had a hair going up this way.

28:19.640 --> 28:20.640
I don't fucking know.

28:20.640 --> 28:21.640
Let's just pretend.

28:21.640 --> 28:29.140
Um, and then, um, I'm trying to think of my other female characters cause they had more.

28:29.140 --> 28:30.640
It wasn't just Addison.

28:30.640 --> 28:32.640
Oh my God, what the fuck was her name?

28:32.640 --> 28:37.640
There was one other girl that I used to draw all the time besides Kiri and Addison.

28:39.640 --> 28:43.640
Uh, Julian and Romeo.

28:44.640 --> 28:48.640
And then I don't know why Addison is in zero, but you know.

28:51.640 --> 28:57.640
Um, and then a nameless girl that I can't remember, but she was there too.

28:57.640 --> 29:00.640
She was like my evil OC.

29:00.640 --> 29:07.640
I can't, I think she had like, maybe I didn't, she was tan cause I think she had like a fro or like really big hair at least.

29:07.640 --> 29:09.640
Oh, let me give her some eyelashes.

29:09.640 --> 29:13.640
But yeah, so I had, I had a lot.

29:13.640 --> 29:14.640
I had more than this.

29:14.640 --> 29:16.640
I just literally can't remember them.

29:16.640 --> 29:18.640
I probably had like 17.

29:19.640 --> 29:21.640
Mika Boshi, what?

29:21.640 --> 29:24.640
Can you blame her for being in zero?

29:26.640 --> 29:29.640
Um, but yeah, I'm just, I'm just, I'm literally just scribbling.

29:29.640 --> 29:33.640
Um, but yeah, that was a little insight into my twisted mind.

29:35.640 --> 29:45.640
But I would totally, and when I was, um, before I, uh, became my PL,

29:45.640 --> 29:48.640
I was actually debating to name myself Kiri.

29:49.640 --> 29:53.640
Um, I was Kiri light something.

29:53.640 --> 29:57.640
I don't know, Kiri, cause it was like cut, cause Kiri means cut.

29:58.640 --> 30:01.640
I don't know if I did like something like terrible, like cut self.

30:03.640 --> 30:05.640
Um, which one dated Clary on the witch boy?

30:05.640 --> 30:06.640
Oh, hold on.

30:06.640 --> 30:07.640
Let me draw you her.

30:08.640 --> 30:09.640
That was missy.

30:09.640 --> 30:14.640
So I also, I might, I'll try to hunt it down.

30:14.640 --> 30:16.640
I don't know if I have it.

30:16.640 --> 30:17.640
I did not hunt.

30:17.640 --> 30:19.640
I don't, I didn't really like Sonic that much.

30:19.640 --> 30:24.640
I liked young justice, teen Titans, uh, Naruto.

30:26.640 --> 30:27.640
Soul leader.

30:27.640 --> 30:30.640
I'm trying to think of what other things I like made self insert OCs for.

30:32.640 --> 30:33.640
Oh yeah.

30:34.640 --> 30:38.640
But like usually I would just stick Kiri in like multiple scenarios.

30:38.640 --> 30:42.640
I saying this out loud makes me sound so fucking crazy.

30:45.640 --> 30:49.640
Oh, but yeah, I liked, I don't like the new young justice.

30:49.640 --> 30:50.640
I didn't watch that.

30:50.640 --> 30:52.640
I like the first and like the second season and I'm like, I'm good.

30:53.640 --> 31:02.640
Um, but so my OC for, um, that for young justice, I have to remember what she looks like.

31:03.640 --> 31:11.640
Her name was missy chief and she went by miss.

31:15.640 --> 31:19.640
That's fucking clever.

31:19.640 --> 31:20.640
I am.

31:20.640 --> 31:21.640
Wow.

31:23.640 --> 31:24.640
You're mentioning coldly.

31:24.640 --> 31:28.640
Oko just activated me like a fucking sleeper agent.

31:28.640 --> 31:32.640
Um, she again, I also, I just really like ponytail is just like scrawny.

31:32.640 --> 31:38.640
So she had, um, she was very much modeled after jinx from teen Titans.

31:38.640 --> 31:43.640
Um, I almost gave her the same powers, but, uh, she had like,

31:43.640 --> 31:47.640
I think like big giant fucking huge pony tails.

31:48.640 --> 31:49.640
If I can recall.

31:50.640 --> 31:51.640
Welcome.

31:51.640 --> 31:53.640
Welcome to being a member.

31:54.640 --> 31:57.640
Um, but it sounds very British.

31:57.640 --> 31:59.640
I wish I'm missy chief.

31:59.640 --> 32:00.640
Yeah.

32:00.640 --> 32:03.640
She was just a total, uh, what's it called?

32:05.640 --> 32:10.640
What is it called when they just like wear a lot of bronzer jinx from Hickman.

32:10.640 --> 32:12.640
No, jinx from teen Titans.

32:12.640 --> 32:14.640
Um, and then again, you had to have the baying.

32:14.640 --> 32:20.640
You always had to have the baying, you know, the baying was a necessary, necessary thing.

32:20.640 --> 32:24.640
Um, but I remember, I can't really remember what her outfit was.

32:26.640 --> 32:29.640
Uh, I think like it was definitely.

32:30.640 --> 32:32.640
Whoa, what the fuck is up with that?

32:33.640 --> 32:38.640
Um, she definitely, I think I gave her like some really short shorts.

32:39.640 --> 32:47.640
And she had naturally had like striped thigh highs and then I think I gave her like, it was like a crop top.

32:48.640 --> 32:52.640
And then she had like finger gloves or whatever.

32:52.640 --> 33:01.640
I'm just going to, um, I'm just going to, yeah, she's going to have little Barbie hands right now.

33:01.640 --> 33:03.640
Um, and then she had a little striped fingerless gloves.

33:03.640 --> 33:04.640
Oh shit.

33:04.640 --> 33:08.640
I don't know how to use this thing yet.

33:08.640 --> 33:12.640
And then she had like high boots or whatever the fuck.

33:12.640 --> 33:15.640
Let me wait.

33:15.640 --> 33:16.640
It's too big.

33:16.640 --> 33:17.640
It's too big.

33:17.640 --> 33:18.640
I won't fit.

33:18.640 --> 33:21.640
Um, yeah.

33:21.640 --> 33:22.640
Damn.

33:22.640 --> 33:24.640
She's starting to look like fucking Ashley.

33:25.640 --> 33:31.640
Um, but yeah, so she was cool.

33:31.640 --> 33:42.640
She could shape shift, but when she shape shift, she could take on the powers met momentarily of the people.

33:42.640 --> 33:45.640
I don't know why I'm making her look so devious.

33:45.640 --> 33:47.640
So I guess what can you expect?

33:47.640 --> 33:51.640
Um, she would take on the powers of the person.

33:51.640 --> 33:52.640
I think she had like touch them.

33:52.640 --> 33:53.640
I don't know.

33:53.640 --> 33:55.640
It was like rogue shit.

33:55.640 --> 33:56.640
I don't know.

33:56.640 --> 33:57.640
But yeah, that was her.

33:57.640 --> 33:59.640
And I can't remember.

33:59.640 --> 34:00.640
Did she have a tail?

34:00.640 --> 34:08.640
No, I can't remember if I gave her like cat ears and a tail just to have an excuse to draw a girl like to make anything a cat girl.

34:08.640 --> 34:09.640
I would.

34:09.640 --> 34:11.640
This is drawing actually represented proportions.

34:11.640 --> 34:16.640
Now in hindsight, I realize I made a lot of my girls like very pet on or pet in.

34:16.640 --> 34:17.640
I don't know how to pronounce it.

34:17.640 --> 34:18.640
Don't come for me.

34:18.640 --> 34:19.640
But like come for me.

34:19.640 --> 34:20.640
But like don't.

34:20.640 --> 34:22.640
Um, so.

34:22.640 --> 34:24.640
But yeah, so I like that.

34:24.640 --> 34:26.640
I made them like really short.

34:26.640 --> 34:30.640
Because again, like what I drew was a lot in like fantasy.

34:30.640 --> 34:34.640
So I'm tall and I have a big to boobies.

34:34.640 --> 34:40.640
So I sometimes would make girls that would like carry definitely like looked like me minus like pink hair.

34:40.640 --> 34:42.640
I might have given her tan skin.

34:42.640 --> 34:43.640
I think I did.

34:43.640 --> 34:45.640
And then like love her.

34:45.640 --> 34:47.640
And then like blue eyes and shit.

34:47.640 --> 34:54.640
And then all the other characters I would make usually were like white or and then like short.

34:54.640 --> 34:55.640
I can't.

34:55.640 --> 34:57.640
I think I may carry like five three.

34:57.640 --> 34:58.640
I don't even remember.

34:58.640 --> 35:00.640
But just me drew cute funny girls.

35:00.640 --> 35:04.640
No, I didn't really know what cute and funny was back then.

35:04.640 --> 35:06.640
Um, but yeah.

35:06.640 --> 35:07.640
So.

35:07.640 --> 35:08.640
But yeah.

35:08.640 --> 35:10.640
So like that was that's a little bit of insight.

35:10.640 --> 35:12.640
And to my drawing history.

35:12.640 --> 35:14.640
Again, as you can see, I scribble.

35:14.640 --> 35:15.640
I'm not good.

35:15.640 --> 35:20.640
If I kind of really wish I had that sketchbook because then I would show you and you guys would be like what the fuck happened.

35:20.640 --> 35:22.640
And I'd be like, yeah.

35:22.640 --> 35:24.640
Coming for.

35:24.640 --> 35:28.640
Honestly, I was like super tempted.

35:28.640 --> 35:34.640
Because when I was cast as she be, I was debating whether or not like as a sketchbook.

35:34.640 --> 35:49.640
Because when I was cast as she be, I was debating whether or not like as a like little inside joke with myself to make some of my like genderbend my OCs and make them people that work in wonderland that you can like interact with.

35:49.640 --> 35:52.640
But then you guys said you wanted to be like the people who work there.

35:52.640 --> 35:53.640
So I'm like, okay, that's fine.

35:53.640 --> 35:55.640
But I think I just it would be really cool.

35:55.640 --> 36:04.640
Maybe at some point in the distant distant future, a little visual novel where you like go to work for wonderland.

36:04.640 --> 36:09.640
That would be actually and then like you can run into Mike genderbend OCs or something.

36:09.640 --> 36:11.640
Something something visiting guests.

36:11.640 --> 36:13.640
Yes.

36:13.640 --> 36:14.640
It should be to the curious.

36:14.640 --> 36:17.640
Oh my God, I literally have to that's going to bother me.

36:17.640 --> 36:19.640
I can't remember her fucking last name.

36:20.640 --> 36:22.640
We're real though.

36:22.640 --> 36:25.640
Um, okay.

36:25.640 --> 36:31.640
So if most of your OCs are flat, that's your chance to redesign them, right?

36:31.640 --> 36:33.640
But it's like I like flat.

36:33.640 --> 36:39.640
I like medium is pretty but like I like all sizes to be not of them like really thinking about it.

36:39.640 --> 36:42.640
I used to like hate small boobs.

36:42.640 --> 36:45.640
But I've I think because it's becoming a Vtuber.

36:45.640 --> 36:54.640
I've appreciated small booba, you know, I think it's I think they're like, and then like seeing it on like real life girls.

36:54.640 --> 36:57.640
I'm like, wow, like that really suits your figure.

36:57.640 --> 36:58.640
I'm not I swear.

36:58.640 --> 37:01.640
I'm not like skeezily checking out women.

37:01.640 --> 37:13.640
But I'm just like, usually, again, because I used to draw a lot, I would look at someone and I would be like, wow, like I would love to draw you because of the way that your body flows or your facial structure.

37:14.640 --> 37:19.640
Small or large, they all carry ups and drinks.

37:19.640 --> 37:22.640
You appreciate them knowing they don't cause much back pain.

37:22.640 --> 37:24.640
Yes, exactly.

37:24.640 --> 37:32.640
And like, I think like if I didn't have arthritis, I don't like because I have arthritis in my neck and in my shoulders.

37:32.640 --> 37:37.640
I feel like if I didn't have it, I would be okay with my size.

37:37.640 --> 37:44.640
But because like, it just like, extraneously puts more pressure on that, it makes me in more pain.

37:44.640 --> 37:47.640
I would I would like eat.

37:47.640 --> 37:52.640
But yeah, you can skeezily check me out.

37:52.640 --> 37:55.640
I'm skeezily checking you all out right now.

37:55.640 --> 37:59.640
Wow, you look really nice.

37:59.640 --> 38:02.640
Let me draw you like one of my harlots.

38:03.640 --> 38:06.640
If only I could hold them for you.

38:06.640 --> 38:08.640
I wish you would.

38:08.640 --> 38:13.640
I wish you I wish I could have like a hair member at all times just like be my bra.

38:13.640 --> 38:20.640
Because even when you wear a bra, they still it still puts pressure on your shoulders because your shoulders are supporting it.

38:20.640 --> 38:26.640
So it's like when if someone were to like lift it up, you just I feel so like I'm doing that right now.

38:26.640 --> 38:31.640
I'm holding up my booba and minus the weight in my hands.

38:31.640 --> 38:33.640
I feel so weightless right now.

38:33.640 --> 38:41.640
I'm like, I'm absentmindedly sticking out my chest because my posture is corrected.

38:41.640 --> 38:44.640
Yeah, there's like, there's good browsers, bad bras.

38:44.640 --> 38:48.640
Like it's whatever your bra, your foot still your waiter.

38:48.640 --> 38:52.640
Yes, I also need you guys to make my bed for me.

38:52.640 --> 38:53.640
Thank you.

38:53.640 --> 38:55.640
Like Aphrodite in record.

38:55.640 --> 38:56.640
Yes, exactly.

38:56.640 --> 38:58.640
Someone sent me a picture of that.

38:58.640 --> 39:04.640
And I'm like, I remember I watched that scene and I was like, oh my God, I need that.

39:04.640 --> 39:06.640
Like Piccolo taking the training weeks.

39:06.640 --> 39:08.640
Yeah, or like Rock Lee.

39:12.640 --> 39:17.640
But yeah, no, but like if I didn't have to, I like if anything like a reduction.

39:17.640 --> 39:23.640
So I'd be like, like a nice like a medium is premium, you know, how much do you pay per hour?

39:23.640 --> 39:25.640
I pay you in whippings.

39:25.640 --> 39:27.640
Piccolo isn't all the time.

39:27.640 --> 39:29.640
Make your bed, but it won't make mine.

39:29.640 --> 39:32.640
If you don't make your own bed, how can I trust you to make mine?

39:32.640 --> 39:35.640
Because then your bed making skills are probably shit.

39:38.640 --> 39:40.640
How many whips per hour?

39:40.640 --> 39:42.640
It depends on the hour.

39:42.640 --> 39:45.640
Depends on the mood I'm feeling.

39:45.640 --> 39:47.640
Like two whips an hour.

39:47.640 --> 39:49.640
Maybe like three.

39:49.640 --> 39:53.640
I like things that are odd numbers because OCD.

39:53.640 --> 39:59.640
Um, but okay, so guys, give me a pose.

39:59.640 --> 40:01.640
I will look up a reference.

40:08.640 --> 40:11.640
And no, I can't draw that.

40:11.640 --> 40:16.640
Jack, what does that mean?

40:19.640 --> 40:22.640
Let me talk to the hair union rep and I'll get back to you.

40:22.640 --> 40:25.640
No, I'm not Jojo posing the guys.

40:25.640 --> 40:28.640
You're not helpful.

40:28.640 --> 40:29.640
What's the jackal?

40:29.640 --> 40:32.640
Okay, I need to look this up.

40:32.640 --> 40:33.640
Jack.

40:33.640 --> 40:35.640
Oh, pose.

40:35.640 --> 40:46.640
Oh, I was wondering what the name of that was because I wanted to get art of me with that pose.

40:46.640 --> 40:48.640
Wait, what?

40:48.640 --> 40:51.640
What characters is from?

40:53.640 --> 40:56.640
A in the lobster?

40:58.640 --> 41:00.640
Oh, guilty gear.

41:00.640 --> 41:07.640
I never played guilty gear, but I love the character designs in guilty gear.

41:07.640 --> 41:09.640
I'm actually like really fucking feeling.

41:09.640 --> 41:12.640
I kind of want to try to see if I can do that right now.

41:12.640 --> 41:14.640
I bet I can.

41:14.640 --> 41:16.640
I bet I can do that.

41:17.640 --> 41:19.640
I bet I'm going to try it.

41:20.640 --> 41:23.640
I mean, I get up and try it.

41:24.640 --> 41:27.640
You don't look at me like that.

41:27.640 --> 41:29.640
This out of the way.

41:30.640 --> 41:37.640
Because sometimes it's like good to like really do the pose reference yourself so you can get into that headspace.

41:37.640 --> 41:41.640
So like if I just, okay.

41:43.640 --> 41:45.640
Oh yeah, this is easy with the fuck.

41:45.640 --> 41:47.640
Oh, oh.

41:48.640 --> 41:50.640
I can jiggle my ass too.

41:50.640 --> 41:52.640
Perfect.

41:52.640 --> 41:53.640
Oh fuck.

41:53.640 --> 41:55.640
Oh my koochie.

41:58.640 --> 41:59.640
Okay.

42:00.640 --> 42:04.640
Let me fix my pillow so I can sit down properly.

42:08.640 --> 42:11.640
She got the body.

42:11.640 --> 42:14.640
I got the body, otty, otty, otty.

42:14.640 --> 42:24.640
You know, when I went to my rheumatologist, they had to do an x-ray on my neck to check out how my arthritis was.

42:24.640 --> 42:29.640
And they were like, wow, for your age, you're more flexible than most.

42:29.640 --> 42:31.640
And I'm like, what's that mean?

42:31.640 --> 42:33.640
And then they're like, oh yeah, by the way, your arthritis got worse.

42:33.640 --> 42:35.640
It's in your other side of the neck.

42:35.640 --> 42:37.640
And your neck, it doesn't have a natural curve.

42:37.640 --> 42:38.640
It's straighter than it should be.

42:38.640 --> 42:40.640
And I'm like, excuse me.

42:40.640 --> 42:42.640
So get that checked out.

42:42.640 --> 42:44.640
Your neck doesn't curve properly.

42:44.640 --> 42:47.640
You usually can get arthritis as I crack my neck into the mic.

42:49.640 --> 42:51.640
For your age, I'm 56.

42:51.640 --> 42:52.640
Exactly.

42:52.640 --> 42:54.640
I'm pretty flexible for 56.

42:58.640 --> 43:01.640
You guys don't believe me that I'm 56.

43:01.640 --> 43:03.640
I'm so sorry.

43:04.640 --> 43:06.640
Okay.

43:06.640 --> 43:09.640
Let me see.

43:09.640 --> 43:12.640
I need to pull up.

43:12.640 --> 43:15.640
I don't think I'm going to be able to draw this, actually.

43:15.640 --> 43:18.640
I can do it, but I can't think I can draw it.

43:18.640 --> 43:23.640
Let me make this smaller.

43:23.640 --> 43:25.640
You sound 56.

43:25.640 --> 43:27.640
Fuck you.

43:27.640 --> 43:29.640
56 years young.

43:29.640 --> 43:30.640
Yeah, don't forget it.

43:30.640 --> 43:33.640
Okay.

43:33.640 --> 43:36.640
So I usually, so I also usually draw on my iPad.

43:36.640 --> 43:40.640
I don't, I use procreate, which is the dumbest name for an app ever.

43:40.640 --> 43:44.640
I usually use procreate when I do doodle.

43:44.640 --> 43:48.640
But I definitely want to try drawing on this tablet.

43:48.640 --> 43:50.640
It's a, I've only ever used Wacom tablets,

43:50.640 --> 43:53.640
but this is a Huon Huon.

43:53.640 --> 43:54.640
I don't know how to pronounce it.

43:54.640 --> 43:56.640
You guys know I can never pronounce anything.

43:58.640 --> 43:59.640
56.

43:59.640 --> 44:00.640
Yeah.

44:00.640 --> 44:04.640
I'm 56 million dollars in debt to the casino of Las Vegas.

44:04.640 --> 44:05.640
Procreate is really good.

44:05.640 --> 44:06.640
Yeah.

44:06.640 --> 44:09.640
Procreate's amazing to be honest with you.

44:09.640 --> 44:11.640
So yeah, I usually sketch in red first.

44:11.640 --> 44:15.640
Wait, I want to make sure you guys can see what I'm drawing.

44:15.640 --> 44:17.640
Perfect.

44:17.640 --> 44:20.640
I'm looking at a reference and it's covering my OBS.

44:20.640 --> 44:31.640
So they have like their shoulders like so in their neck.

44:31.640 --> 44:33.640
You can't really see.

44:33.640 --> 44:38.640
And then you kind of push up their butt and their hips are like right here.

44:38.640 --> 44:44.640
And you got like boom knee, boom knee.

44:44.640 --> 44:47.640
This looks so crazy foot.

44:50.640 --> 44:52.640
Wait, I can't see where her other leg is.

44:56.640 --> 44:58.640
Yeah, let's go.

45:01.640 --> 45:02.640
Fabulous.

45:02.640 --> 45:03.640
Okay.

45:03.640 --> 45:08.640
And then she has her arms like on the ground.

45:14.640 --> 45:16.640
You can figure out what that is, right?

45:16.640 --> 45:19.640
Like I don't, I don't know.

45:19.640 --> 45:21.640
Clip Studio Master Race.

45:21.640 --> 45:23.640
I don't have Clip Studio.

45:23.640 --> 45:26.640
Why don't you buy Clip Studio for me?

45:26.640 --> 45:31.640
I also don't think I'm going to spend money on Clip Studio when I can barely draw.

45:32.640 --> 45:34.640
I don't know.

45:42.640 --> 45:46.640
And then usually, how do I do another layer?

45:46.640 --> 45:47.640
Okay.

45:47.640 --> 45:49.640
Those line work layers, what the fuck?

45:52.640 --> 45:54.640
Can I change the opacity?

45:54.640 --> 45:55.640
How do I, oh.

45:55.640 --> 45:58.640
Then I kind of like lighten that shit up a little bit.

45:58.640 --> 46:01.640
Again, I'm no professional.

46:01.640 --> 46:07.640
Then I'll usually go in with blue to get like the form.

46:07.640 --> 46:18.640
Sorry, I'm looking at her circle and then I kind of connect everything.

46:23.640 --> 46:26.640
Kind of already fucked this up, but it's fine.

46:27.640 --> 46:33.640
I make big boobies pancake on the ground.

46:33.640 --> 46:36.640
I can't do that.

46:38.640 --> 46:40.640
I can't draw hands.

46:40.640 --> 46:43.640
If you could draw hands, you're a witch.

46:43.640 --> 46:44.640
All right.

46:44.640 --> 46:48.640
So just saying.

46:48.640 --> 46:53.640
I usually do just like little, little mitts.

46:54.640 --> 46:59.640
Little oven mitts.

47:09.640 --> 47:10.640
All right.

47:10.640 --> 47:12.640
Perfect.

47:12.640 --> 47:14.640
Yes.

47:14.640 --> 47:19.640
And then they got their, she has a long ass torso.

47:19.640 --> 47:21.640
I do just want to say that.

47:21.640 --> 47:22.640
Holy fuck.

47:22.640 --> 47:24.640
This looks terrifying.

47:28.640 --> 47:32.640
Her back kind of, I kind of need to put the shoulders like.

47:34.640 --> 47:36.640
Kind of lasso to the list of you.

47:39.640 --> 47:41.640
Oh no, it's fine.

47:41.640 --> 47:43.640
I don't really care if I cut off the fingies.

47:45.640 --> 47:46.640
A little closer.

47:46.640 --> 47:48.640
Fabulous.

47:48.640 --> 47:49.640
Wow.

47:52.640 --> 47:58.640
You know, that's what this is what we do here.

47:58.640 --> 48:02.640
We just, we really just want to let you have those horror vibes.

48:04.640 --> 48:07.640
I don't know how people draw this pose because that's like.

48:08.640 --> 48:10.640
Like hello.

48:11.640 --> 48:12.640
Like this.

48:15.640 --> 48:18.640
No, no, no, no.

48:18.640 --> 48:19.640
Okay.

48:19.640 --> 48:21.640
I'm getting ahead of myself.

48:35.640 --> 48:36.640
Yeah.

48:36.640 --> 48:38.640
That looks a little bit better.

48:39.640 --> 48:42.640
It's like, it doesn't really look like it's sloping in though.

48:42.640 --> 48:45.640
It's like the back isn't as sloped as it should be.

48:45.640 --> 48:47.640
I'm literally looking at a jackal pose.

48:47.640 --> 48:50.640
Like I'm looking at that as a reference right now.

48:50.640 --> 48:51.640
Why is there?

48:53.640 --> 48:57.640
I made the mistake of looking at Thanos jackal pose.

49:00.640 --> 49:01.640
Oh man.

49:02.640 --> 49:03.640
Oh man.

49:06.640 --> 49:10.640
Yeah, it's I made the arch two bit because like in.

49:11.640 --> 49:16.640
In that game and in Guilty Gear, like whatever this is from.

49:16.640 --> 49:19.640
Um, they have a way longer torso proportion.

49:19.640 --> 49:22.640
My cat is like using the litter box proportionately.

49:22.640 --> 49:27.640
So let me actually kind of not go by their proportions.

49:27.640 --> 49:30.640
I might go by Thanos's proportions.

49:31.640 --> 49:35.640
Let me just look at that and real fast.

49:36.640 --> 49:41.640
Because Thanos is like this and then.

49:41.640 --> 49:44.640
Yeah, thank you Thanos.

49:44.640 --> 49:46.640
Oh, Thanos, you're so helpful.

49:46.640 --> 49:47.640
Thank you.

49:48.640 --> 49:50.640
Yeah, it's as good as it's going to get.

50:01.640 --> 50:02.640
Wow.

50:03.640 --> 50:05.640
This kind of looks like a horse.

50:07.640 --> 50:08.640
And then foot.

50:09.640 --> 50:10.640
And then foot.

50:21.640 --> 50:22.640
Perfect.

50:23.640 --> 50:25.640
I think that came out good.

50:26.640 --> 50:28.640
I think that came out pretty nice.

50:32.640 --> 50:33.640
I'm gonna.

50:35.640 --> 50:36.640
I'm gonna.

50:36.640 --> 50:37.640
Can I hold on?

50:40.640 --> 50:41.640
How do I delete a layer?

50:43.640 --> 50:45.640
Can I just delete a layer?

50:45.640 --> 50:46.640
Okay, I guess I can't.

50:46.640 --> 50:47.640
Oh wait, there's a trash.

50:48.640 --> 50:49.640
Okay.

50:49.640 --> 50:52.640
And then I'm going to move this guy over here.

50:52.640 --> 50:55.640
We'll start on our next pose.

50:59.640 --> 51:00.640
So this is pretty good.

51:00.640 --> 51:01.640
We got the jackal pose.

51:01.640 --> 51:03.640
I'll put the jackal pose off to the side.

51:03.640 --> 51:05.640
You can see it's head poking out.

51:06.640 --> 51:08.640
The cami stretch from Street Fighter.

51:09.640 --> 51:11.640
Okay, hold on, let me look that up.

51:13.640 --> 51:15.640
Okay, I think I know which one.

51:15.640 --> 51:16.640
I just need to see it.

51:16.640 --> 51:18.640
It's when she's lifting up her leg.

51:26.640 --> 51:27.640
Oh no, it's not.

51:28.640 --> 51:30.640
What the fuck is this pose?

51:32.640 --> 51:34.640
I thought it was one.

51:34.640 --> 51:36.640
There's like, there's like one.

51:39.640 --> 51:44.640
I like how the jackal pose still shows up

51:44.640 --> 51:46.640
because they compare it to the cami stretch.

51:47.640 --> 51:50.640
Damn, what the fuck is this stretch?

51:50.640 --> 51:52.640
Okay, I have to do it myself.

51:52.640 --> 51:53.640
Hold on.

51:53.640 --> 51:56.640
Damn, her back is like a table.

51:59.640 --> 52:01.640
Damn, how the fuck does she do that?

52:03.640 --> 52:04.640
This feels nice.

52:04.640 --> 52:05.640
Hold on, let me crack my back.

52:11.640 --> 52:12.640
Ooh, did you hear that?

52:16.640 --> 52:18.640
Oh, sorry, it's my back.

52:19.640 --> 52:24.640
Oh, sorry, it's my old bones.

52:26.640 --> 52:28.640
My old, old bones.

52:34.640 --> 52:36.640
That was my hip, don't tell anybody.

52:39.640 --> 52:42.640
I still have the Thanos pose open.

52:42.640 --> 52:48.640
Cami street fighter pose.

52:57.640 --> 52:59.640
Oh my god, that's so fucking small.

53:02.640 --> 53:03.640
Okay.

53:03.640 --> 53:05.640
Why is it so small?

53:05.640 --> 53:06.640
I can't see this.

53:07.640 --> 53:08.640
Okay, that's big enough.

53:09.640 --> 53:11.640
Cool, okay, I need an almond.

53:13.640 --> 53:15.640
Time for the hip back complete.

53:18.640 --> 53:19.640
Is that maybe your gelf?

53:19.640 --> 53:20.640
Yeah.

53:22.640 --> 53:24.640
I'm not a milf, I'm a kill.

53:27.640 --> 53:30.640
My eyesight has been folding since I've been born.

53:35.640 --> 53:37.640
You prefer cokers good?

53:39.640 --> 53:41.640
Okay, so.

53:43.640 --> 53:45.640
Do this on a new layer.

53:46.640 --> 53:48.640
So, see, this isn't that bad.

53:48.640 --> 53:50.640
This one, oh, I'm not on pencil.

53:50.640 --> 53:51.640
This one.

53:56.640 --> 53:59.640
I can't see where I'm drawing because I need a third screen.

54:02.640 --> 54:06.640
So, you got the head, oh fuck, you got the head.

54:06.640 --> 54:07.640
That's so big.

54:09.640 --> 54:10.640
Head.

54:11.640 --> 54:13.640
I need to like back up a little bit.

54:13.640 --> 54:14.640
There we go.

54:21.640 --> 54:25.640
All you see is like the jackal pose in the corner.

54:29.640 --> 54:31.640
Please hold on for money.

54:33.640 --> 54:36.640
We love, yeah, you better love hags in this house.

54:37.640 --> 54:40.640
Madam, see these money, bro, I'm broke.

54:40.640 --> 54:41.640
Don't even.

54:44.640 --> 54:46.640
I got so much debt to pay off.

54:46.640 --> 54:49.640
Because of my own medical bills from being elderly.

54:49.640 --> 54:51.640
And then fees medical bills.

54:53.640 --> 54:56.640
I hate the American healthcare system.

54:59.640 --> 55:00.640
I need another drink.

55:02.640 --> 55:05.640
Can one of you guys get me a seltzer water for my fridge?

55:06.640 --> 55:07.640
Okay.

55:07.640 --> 55:09.640
So, she's kind of like looking up.

55:13.640 --> 55:15.640
And then her...

55:16.640 --> 55:17.640
Hold on, I cannot see that.

55:25.640 --> 55:28.640
Damn, her shoulders are like fucking dislocated.

55:30.640 --> 55:33.640
I'm like realizing how little range and motion I have

55:33.640 --> 55:35.640
because of my fucking...

55:36.640 --> 55:38.640
I need to go to a chiropractor.

55:43.640 --> 55:44.640
I just hurt my shoulder.

55:44.640 --> 55:45.640
Okay.

55:45.640 --> 55:49.640
And then she kind of, her neck's like there.

55:49.640 --> 55:51.640
I'm gonna draw some big old boobies.

55:55.640 --> 55:57.640
That actually will help me though.

55:57.640 --> 55:59.640
Now that I think about it.

55:59.640 --> 56:02.640
Because if her chest is like this...

56:03.640 --> 56:04.640
Yeah, Reina.

56:06.640 --> 56:07.640
Reina, what?

56:08.640 --> 56:09.640
Reina, please.

56:10.640 --> 56:12.640
Reina, are you spitting facts?

56:13.640 --> 56:14.640
Okay.

56:17.640 --> 56:20.640
And then her shoulders are like up here.

56:21.640 --> 56:22.640
And then...

56:22.640 --> 56:24.640
I can't tell where her elbows are.

56:24.640 --> 56:28.640
I think they're like near her ears.

56:29.640 --> 56:30.640
And then hand...

56:30.640 --> 56:31.640
Wait.

56:31.640 --> 56:32.640
Yeah.

56:32.640 --> 56:33.640
Hand.

56:34.640 --> 56:35.640
Hand.

56:40.640 --> 56:42.640
And then you just travel through...

56:43.640 --> 56:44.640
Reina!

56:45.640 --> 56:47.640
Are you good?

56:49.640 --> 56:50.640
Ma'am.

56:53.640 --> 56:54.640
Reina, come here.

56:55.640 --> 56:56.640
Who are you talking to?

56:58.640 --> 56:59.640
Is it the demon again?

57:00.640 --> 57:01.640
I'm alone.

57:01.640 --> 57:02.640
They're trying to chill.

57:06.640 --> 57:07.640
Yeah.

57:10.640 --> 57:11.640
Come on.

57:14.640 --> 57:15.640
Reina.

57:15.640 --> 57:16.640
Okay.

57:16.640 --> 57:17.640
She's sorry.

57:17.640 --> 57:19.640
She's gonna keep talking to the demons.

57:21.640 --> 57:22.640
Reina!

57:22.640 --> 57:23.640
She's cat coming senile?

57:23.640 --> 57:24.640
No.

57:24.640 --> 57:25.640
She's already...

57:25.640 --> 57:26.640
She is 14.

57:29.640 --> 57:30.640
But...

57:34.640 --> 57:36.640
What the fuck am I doing with these hips?

57:37.640 --> 57:38.640
Okay, her legs are spread.

57:38.640 --> 57:39.640
That sounds funny.

57:44.640 --> 57:47.640
You gotta get the ill thigh gap in there, you know?

57:50.640 --> 57:51.640
Whoa.

57:56.640 --> 57:57.640
Exactly.

57:57.640 --> 57:58.640
Reina.

58:00.640 --> 58:01.640
Oh.

58:02.640 --> 58:03.640
You brought me something?

58:05.640 --> 58:06.640
Yeah, thank you.

58:08.640 --> 58:09.640
Hi, Reina.

58:13.640 --> 58:14.640
Wake up.

58:15.640 --> 58:16.640
You just wanna hang out?

58:18.640 --> 58:19.640
Yeah.

58:22.640 --> 58:23.640
Yeah.

58:25.640 --> 58:26.640
Are you...

58:27.640 --> 58:28.640
Are you spitting facts?

58:30.640 --> 58:33.640
She brought the seltzer water.

58:33.640 --> 58:34.640
She did.

58:34.640 --> 58:35.640
She did.

58:35.640 --> 58:36.640
She brought me the seltzer water.

58:38.640 --> 58:39.640
Reina.

58:41.640 --> 58:42.640
Hi.

58:46.640 --> 58:47.640
She's very helpful.

58:48.640 --> 58:50.640
Reina, do you wanna say hi to my chat?

58:50.640 --> 58:52.640
She's just rubbing against the microphone.

58:52.640 --> 58:53.640
Can you say hi?

58:55.640 --> 58:56.640
Can you...

58:56.640 --> 58:57.640
No, can you say hi?

58:58.640 --> 58:59.640
Reina.

59:01.640 --> 59:02.640
Can you say hi?

59:05.640 --> 59:07.640
She's just rubbing against the microphone.

59:08.640 --> 59:09.640
Reina.

59:11.640 --> 59:12.640
Hey, lady.

59:14.640 --> 59:15.640
What are you doing?

59:18.640 --> 59:20.640
She is looking my arm.

59:20.640 --> 59:21.640
Okay.

59:21.640 --> 59:23.640
Her name is spelt rain than an A.

59:28.640 --> 59:29.640
I'm not in the mood for taking a...

59:29.640 --> 59:31.640
She doesn't wanna talk to you guys.

59:32.640 --> 59:33.640
She'll purr for you, but she won't...

59:33.640 --> 59:35.640
Oh, she's on my shoulder now.

59:35.640 --> 59:36.640
All right.

59:36.640 --> 59:38.640
Do you wanna purr for chat?

59:39.640 --> 59:41.640
Can purr for chat?

59:46.640 --> 59:48.640
I don't know if you guys can hear that.

59:58.640 --> 59:59.640
Oh, my God.

59:59.640 --> 01:00:00.640
I need to brush you.

01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:01.640
Jesus, fuck.

01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:07.640
You were shedding so much.

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:09.640
Reina is a queen.

01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:15.640
So it actually fits that the Spanish spelling of her name means queen.

01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:17.640
Reina.

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:18.640
Reina.

01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:21.640
She's the queen of the house.

01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:25.640
I need to brush.

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:29.640
She's 14 years old.

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:32.640
Bumi and Fia are both one year.

01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:35.640
They just turned one year in March and April.

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:37.640
Respectively.

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:40.640
Come brush me, save Reina.

01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:43.640
Reina is named after...

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:45.640
I used to really love America's Next Top Model,

01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:47.640
and there was a model named Reina,

01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:50.640
and she was so pretty and had really pretty blue eyes.

01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:55.640
So I named Reina after her.

01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:59.640
And then it just worked.

01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:03.640
You could probably Google it.

01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:05.640
Bunny drawing Pony.

01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:06.640
What?

01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:11.640
Reina like from Fire Emblem like Vietnam.

01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:13.640
Fia is from Elden Ring.

01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:17.640
Bumi is from...

01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:21.640
Avatar The Last Airbender.

01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:23.640
And then Soleil was also...

01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:26.640
Because I wanted like a theme for like the elements.

01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:28.640
Soleil like Soleil.

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:29.640
She passed away years ago,

01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:31.640
but Soleil was like Fire.

01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:33.640
Reina is like Water.

01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:34.640
Bumi's Earth.

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:37.640
And then I couldn't think of anything for air.

01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:39.640
So Fia was just Fia.

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:45.640
I say senile as a possibility for a cat at 14.

01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:47.640
No, she's actually pretty all there.

01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:51.640
So cats will do this thing where when they have a toy,

01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:54.640
they like to announce to people they caught something.

01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:55.640
Because they think you don't eat,

01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:58.640
and so she was calling everybody to come get food.

01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:00.640
This is essentially what she was doing.

01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:01.640
Fia is light.

01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:06.640
Fia, technically Fia's full name is Fiala.

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:10.640
Because I think in like Czech,

01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:12.640
Fiala means violet,

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:16.640
and Fia's skin like around her ears is purple and not pink.

01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:19.640
Actual Warrior Cats fan.

01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:20.640
Yes, that's me.

01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:25.640
But yeah, Reina likes to bring stuff to me,

01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:27.640
and I'll usually have like my toys,

01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:30.640
her favorite toys are in my bed because she'll bring them to me.

01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:35.640
I got her cat stairs in anticipation of my new bed frame.

01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:37.640
She likes to take the cat stairs,

01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:41.640
and the cat stairs also has a bed inside,

01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:43.640
and Fia likes to sleep in there.

01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:44.640
I'll take a picture after stream,

01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:46.640
because I bet she's in there right now.

01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:49.640
And Reina is like desperately hugging me.

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:50.640
What's up?

01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:51.640
You just want to be snuggled?

01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:53.640
I was snuggling with you all morning.

01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:58.640
I'm really craving like spicy chicken.

01:02:58.640 --> 01:02:59.640
Oh fuck.

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:01.640
Oh my god.

01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:03.640
Okay, I'm going to brush you while I talk to chat.

01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:04.640
How about that?

01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:07.640
Because you are shit.

01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:08.640
You still brush me.

01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:09.640
Oh no!

01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:11.640
I brought my bed.

01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:15.640
She's still purring in my arms.

01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:19.640
Over here.

01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:23.640
Purr is harder.

01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:25.640
Yeah, big mama.

01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:27.640
I know you like the brushes.

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:31.640
Spicy chicken from where?

01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:32.640
I don't know.

01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:35.640
I just don't like really crispy spicy chicken right now.

01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:49.640
Sorry, I'm just focusing brushing my cat.

01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:52.640
She's like shedding so much,

01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:53.640
because it's so much.

01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:54.640
Although Simon's cats don't really shed,

01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:56.640
but like Reina sheds a lot.

01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:58.640
She's always shed a lot for some reason.

01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:00.640
Other cats don't shed that much.

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:05.640
I'm drawing while I was drawing

01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:07.640
the campy street fighter stretch.

01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:13.640
Just like me getting strung by she for real for real.

01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:17.640
Now she's trying to escape me.

01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:19.640
Where are you going?

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:23.640
Where are you going, miss ma'am?

01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:26.640
Oh my gosh, there's so much cat here on this brush.

01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:28.640
Yeah, just hang out.

01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:35.640
I can't wait to use the vacuum later,

01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:37.640
because you're covering cat hair,

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:39.640
and it's everywhere.

01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:42.640
I self-insert as Reina.

01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:44.640
Yeah, I'm just brushing you.

01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:46.640
I don't know if you can even hear the brushing noises.

01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:53.640
Oh my gosh.

01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:57.640
I have one of those blood brushes

01:04:57.640 --> 01:04:59.640
you can click in a little like...

01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:02.640
What's it called?

01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:04.640
Show all the hair that you got.

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:06.640
I'll take a picture of the hair that just came off Reina,

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:08.640
and you guys will be like, what the hell?

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:11.640
And mind you, I brush her very often.

01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:14.640
She just sheds a lot, because I think she's older.

01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:17.640
You're going bald, old woman.

01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:19.640
No, I'm kidding. She doesn't even look like she's old.

01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:23.640
She's 14, but she looks like she's a 5-year-old cat.

01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:28.640
Yeah, let me get some booty cheeks.

01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:31.640
She's not even fluffy.

01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:33.640
They're short-haired cats.

01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:35.640
I've never owned a long-haired cat.

01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:39.640
Oh yeah, you liking it, huh, mami?

01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:43.640
Wholesome cat brushing.

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:46.640
56.

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:50.640
I think in cat ears, Reina is actually like 72.

01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:55.640
But she's still spry.

01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:57.640
The other cats, she keeps up with them.

01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:11.640
Some great ASMR.

01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:15.640
Young bald woman.

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:18.640
I'm so sorry.

01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:21.640
She's not even bald. She's like very...

01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:24.640
She's like, she looks perfectly normal.

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:26.640
She was seeing pictures of her in my alt account.

01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:33.640
You'll see that she just looks like a normal cat.

01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:36.640
But she's like signies.

01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:39.640
I can't wait to sneeze later.

01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:42.640
Yay.

01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:47.640
It came for the arts.

01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:49.640
It came for the brushing ASMR.

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:54.640
It's not my fault that my stream got derailed by my lovely old cat

01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:57.640
who just wants to be brushed.

01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:00.640
She's enjoying herself and she's looking up at me with love in her eyes.

01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:04.640
Reina will actually usually be on my lap.

01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:06.640
Reina will actually usually be on my lap during a lot of streams

01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:09.640
because she is my soul kitty.

01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:12.640
So she just likes to be near me at all times.

01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:15.640
And also when she knows that I'm stressed out from playing a game

01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:18.640
she'll come and see me.

01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:21.640
Okay, I'm going to take a picture of these giant pieces of fuzz

01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:24.640
that just came off of Reina and I'll show you guys.

01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:30.640
Oh fuck, I need to plug my phone in. It's almost dead.

01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:36.640
I need a dry can of the picture.

01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:46.640
And then I'll take a picture of her on my lap.

01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:49.640
She's just chilling.

01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:52.640
Ew.

01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:04.640
And it's funny because I wear a lot of black

01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:07.640
and so it's just usually Reina's hair on me.

01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:10.640
Okay, Reina, I'm going to put you down now, okay?

01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:13.640
He's like, no, mother.

01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:16.640
Please, mother, no.

01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:18.640
You've forsaken me.

01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:21.640
Does he know about the alt?

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:24.640
I don't think he knows about the alt, boys.

01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:30.640
Reina looks like it just killed her family

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:33.640
because they put her on the floor.

01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:36.640
Reina, why do you have that look on your face?

01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:40.640
I just totally threw you to the wolves.

01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:44.640
Throw me to the wolves and I'll come back pregnant.

01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:49.640
No, I didn't mean to start recording the video.

01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:56.640
I wish someone would treat me like she treats her cats.

01:08:57.640 --> 01:08:58.640
Yes, I love my kitties.

01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:00.640
I treat my cats with the utmost care.

01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:03.640
Here in my world.

01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:08.640
Okay, Reina, you need to move.

01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:11.640
She's like, let me sit exactly where your chair goes.

01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:15.640
I still need to get a shelter.

01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:18.640
Because Reina left it on the floor.

01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:22.640
Reina, can you pass me that seltzer water that you brought me?

01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:25.640
She slipped her tail.

01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:27.640
Okay, fine, I'll get it myself.

01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:45.640
There's cat hair all over my tablet.

01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:47.640
I'll get it myself.

01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:56.640
Some spicy seltzer water.

01:09:57.640 --> 01:09:59.640
I usually call it seltzer water, spicy water.

01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:03.640
Anyways, let's get back on track, sorry.

01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:08.640
And then she got some...

01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:12.640
Wait, I'm always terrible with proportions for legs.

01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:17.640
So it's like that.

01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:19.640
Koochie.

01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:21.640
Koochie.

01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:23.640
Five butt fang.

01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:37.640
This kind of looks like horse legs, but don't worry about it.

01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:42.640
She has such wide fucking hips.

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:47.640
I didn't make her boobs bigger just for the proportions.

01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:51.640
Just so at least people will think this is fetish art.

01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:55.640
So it makes at least a little bit of sense.

01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:57.640
Perfect.

01:10:57.640 --> 01:10:58.640
Okay.

01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:05.640
Lovely.

01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:08.640
Fabulous.

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:12.640
And then, you know, intertwine the fingers.

01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:18.640
Now we're getting somewhere.

01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:19.640
The quads go hard.

01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:22.640
Okay, so I'll make another layer and I'll put this in blue.

01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:25.640
So it's like you can get rid of all that gross sketch.

01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:32.640
So she's like kind of looking up.

01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:34.640
Might need a darker blue.

01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:37.640
So she's kind of looking...

01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:38.640
Oh my God.

01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:40.640
Looking up.

01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:47.640
She's like, you know, perfect booby.

01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:51.640
You get a better stabilizer booby.

01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:01.640
This looks, you know, pretty good.

01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:03.640
You get the free armpit.

01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:11.640
I think the first thing I need to do is work on proportions.

01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:16.640
Elbow.

01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:18.640
Perfect.

01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:23.640
Hey man, this looks pretty fabulous.

01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:25.640
If I don't mind.

01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:31.640
And then you gotta get that gorgeous waistline.

01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:36.640
So she's got, yeah, she's got some crazy quads.

01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:41.640
I don't know why I gave her a fucking bulge.

01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:43.640
She got the ill thigh gap.

01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:45.640
She got some butt fangs.

01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:49.640
I don't know why I gave her a fucking bulge.

01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:51.640
She got the ill thigh gap.

01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:53.640
She got some butt fangs.

01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:55.640
I don't know why I gave her a fucking bulge.

01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:08.640
Who needs knees with thighs like these?

01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:12.640
Watermelon don't stand a chance.

01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:20.640
But, well, get some definition.

01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:22.640
No, I don't like that.

01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:25.640
Okay.

01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:30.640
And then see it's put her calf over there.

01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:33.640
Yeah.

01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:36.640
She's too.

01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:46.640
You gotta get those oven mitt hands in.

01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:53.640
That, you know, that's pretty good.

01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:55.640
To be honest with you.

01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:03.640
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty bomb.

01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:05.640
You know, your belly button.

01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:11.640
Behind the jack of all.

01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:14.640
Okay, hold on.

01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:15.640
Let me delete this.

01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:17.640
Look at that.

01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:19.640
Gorgeous outline.

01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:22.640
This.

01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:28.640
Let me shrink her.

01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:31.640
Fuck.

01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:33.640
Fuck.

01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:34.640
Fuck.

01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:36.640
I don't know how to use this.

01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:37.640
Fuck.

01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:38.640
Still not.

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:39.640
I spread her legs too much.

01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:42.640
I don't know how to use this.

01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:43.640
Fuck.

01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:44.640
Fuck.

01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:48.640
No, I don't want to cut.

01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:49.640
I just want.

01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:51.640
Okay.

01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:52.640
Deselect.

01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:56.640
Just use the lasso tool because God fucking damn.

01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:04.640
I just want to move this.

01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:08.640
Oh, wait, it's because it's on a different layer.

01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:11.640
Whoopsies.

01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:13.640
I don't.

01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:15.640
I guess I'll just stick her over here.

01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:20.640
Oh, you guys can't see what I'm doing.

01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:23.640
Why?

01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:26.640
All right, we'll move over there.

01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:28.640
All right.

01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:29.640
What's another.

01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:32.640
I did stick her behind the other one.

01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:33.640
I don't want point.

01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:35.640
I don't know if you guys saw it, but maybe it's a good thing.

01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:36.640
Drop.

01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:37.640
I can't draw that.

01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:40.640
Sometimes that's true.

01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:42.640
So that's come out as you should.

01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:45.640
Now.

01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:49.640
Playing with a boil ball now.

01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:55.640
Any JoJo pose, a stick figure.

01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:57.640
See, I could do a stick figure.

01:15:57.640 --> 01:15:59.640
No more.

01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:01.640
What's a momo cute pose?

01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:06.640
It's funny when I don't know what pose that is when I've done the thingy.

01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:08.640
Okay.

01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:17.640
Oh, it's just the fucking heart.

01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:18.640
Okay.

01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:19.640
Yes, I do know that.

01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:21.640
Perfect.

01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:22.640
Okay, we'll do that.

01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:25.640
Stick figure with big Buzzingas.

01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:32.640
Big Buzzingas only.

01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:36.640
Okay, so she's really cute.

01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:38.640
Okay.

01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:43.640
Let's do a new layer.

01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:51.640
She so she know you have her.

01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:53.640
Her head.

01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:54.640
Oh, hello.

01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:56.640
Oh, it's because it's fucking still selected.

01:16:57.640 --> 01:16:58.640
You have her head.

01:16:58.640 --> 01:16:59.640
Okay.

01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:07.640
And she's kind of like, oh,

01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:10.640
I love you.

01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:12.640
The heart.

01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:18.640
I'm going to make her looking straight on.

01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:21.640
And.

01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:24.640
She's got.

01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:31.640
Sometimes I get lost in my own BGM.

01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:33.640
So no.

01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:36.640
Massive, but don't go home.

01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:42.640
And she's kind of just.

01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:45.640
You are not.

01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:48.640
Oh, no.

01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:50.640
No.

01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:52.640
No.

01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:54.640
No.

01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:56.640
No.

01:17:57.640 --> 01:17:58.640
Wait.

01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:00.640
Proportions.

01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:01.640
Hello.

01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:03.640
Arm proportions.

01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:05.640
They don't exist here.

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:08.640
What the fuck am I doing?

01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:10.640
Okay, we're going to fuck that up.

01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:15.640
Okay, let's just do like the heart here.

01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:19.640
Those are the hands.

01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:21.640
There we go.

01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:22.640
That's better.

01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:29.640
And yeah, she's kind of just hanging out standing.

01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:31.640
So I guess I'll just make her stand.

01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:34.640
Cute.

01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:35.640
Adorable.

01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:37.640
I kind of made her arms too short, but it's fine.

01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:39.640
The bowling.

01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:44.640
She's got.

01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:45.640
She's doing the heart.

01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:47.640
She's.

01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:55.640
Listen, I don't know why I love to draw like very exaggerated hourglass figures.

01:18:57.640 --> 01:18:58.640
So like.

01:18:58.640 --> 01:18:59.640
Leave me alone.

01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:02.640
Like.

01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:04.640
So like.

01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:05.640
Leave me alone.

01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:08.640
Like.

01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:18.640
I'll make this leg in front.

01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:22.640
So we have, you know, a little bit more depth.

01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:24.640
This leg will be behind.

01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:26.640
And we got to make her a cat girl.

01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:28.640
Or actually, this looks like a puppy girl.

01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:30.640
So we're going to make her a puppy girl.

01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:34.640
She's kind of looking flat.

01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:36.640
I haven't gotten to that part yet.

01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:38.640
Leave me alone.

01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:40.640
Okay.

01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:41.640
Let's make a new layer.

01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:51.640
Gotta grab blue.

01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:56.640
I'm trying very hard.

01:19:56.640 --> 01:19:57.640
Okay.

01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:02.640
I'm so focused on making sure my anatomy is perfect even to the detriment of my art.

01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:04.640
I just don't care right now.

01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:10.640
If you haven't noticed, this isn't a serious drawing stream.

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:14.640
And probably all of them I'd ever do will not be serious.

01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:24.640
I definitely made her shoulders way too fucking narrow.

01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:29.640
It's fine.

01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:33.640
Drawing on the wrong fucking layer, Shibi.

01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:37.640
Don't worry about it.

01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:39.640
She's just a petite gal.

01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:41.640
You know?

01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:46.640
I just really want to straw boobs right now.

01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:48.640
Okay.

01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:54.640
I did it.

01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:56.640
I did it.

01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:09.640
Gotta make her cute puppy ears.

01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:12.640
You know?

01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:16.640
We'll give her some really fabu hair, you know?

01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:31.640
Kind of looks like a poodle.

01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:33.640
I'm kind of living for it.

01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:53.640
One of my personal pet peeves is when a character is a kemenomumimimi that I can't pronounce,

01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:55.640
but they have human fucking ears.

01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:58.640
It bothers the fuck out of me.

01:21:58.640 --> 01:22:00.640
I used to tease one of my friends.

01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:02.640
I don't know if she's still in the chat, Toto,

01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:05.640
because she is a tiger and she has tiger ears,

01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:07.640
but then she has human ears.

01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:09.640
And then she messaged me this morning

01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:11.640
and she's just like, guess what?

01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:12.640
I'm like, what?

01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:13.640
She's like,

01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:16.640
Reora Panthera from Hololive has double ears

01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:19.640
and I literally almost threw my phone across the room.

01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:23.640
Because she has cat ears and she has human ears.

01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:24.640
Why do you need more?

01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:25.640
Why do you need four ears?

01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:27.640
You don't need four ears.

01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:28.640
It bothered me so bad.

01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:30.640
Like, and really, you prefer double ears?

01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:32.640
What is wrong with you?

01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:35.640
Are they just vestigial organs then?

01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:37.640
Like, which are the ones that you use?

01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:41.640
Is better for canonically fake ears and a headband?

01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:42.640
Then that's fine.

01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:44.640
She does.

01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:45.640
She does have double ears.

01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:46.640
Yeah, Fuuamoko has double ears.

01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:48.640
Wait, Fuuamoko has double ears?

01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:49.640
Hold on.

01:22:55.640 --> 01:22:56.640
You're lying to me.

01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:00.640
You have got to be lying to me.

01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:02.640
No, they, no, they don't.

01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:03.640
No, they don't.

01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:05.640
Wait.

01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:07.640
Fuuamoko?

01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:11.640
No, they don't.

01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:15.640
They don't have double ears.

01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:20.640
What the fuck?

01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:24.640
How could you lie to me like that?

01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:33.640
Well, I just look at so much shit.

01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:34.640
They do not.

01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:38.640
I just look at so much art.

01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:40.640
Their ears are not there.

01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:43.640
In looking at their models, their ears are not there.

01:23:47.640 --> 01:23:49.640
Serenity has...

01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:52.640
Serenity has double ears?

01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:56.640
So, I'll spoil something for you.

01:23:57.640 --> 01:23:59.640
In my trailer,

01:24:01.640 --> 01:24:03.640
I had double ears and I was like,

01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:05.640
get those fucking ears out of here.

01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:07.640
I hate it.

01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:10.640
Because I used to have human ears and I was like,

01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:14.640
no, get those fucking ears out.

01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:16.640
I hate double ears.

01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:19.640
Just cover them with hair where the ears would normally be.

01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:23.640
I hate it.

01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:25.640
So, like, it's literally one of my pet peeves.

01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:26.640
It bothers me.

01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:27.640
It turns me off.

01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:34.640
How the fuck am I going to draw this other arm?

01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:41.640
How the fuck am I going to draw this other arm?

01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:46.640
So, I'm seething right now.

01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:49.640
I can't believe Mokoko and Fulawa have fucking double ears.

01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:51.640
I'm literally so upset.

01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:55.640
Butt fangs.

01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:57.640
I love me some butt fangs.

01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:02.640
When I was doing shit with my model and I took off my skirt,

01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:04.640
I was like, yo!

01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:06.640
Because I didn't think I had those.

01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:09.640
No, I don't hate them.

01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:12.640
I'm just, I'm just, I'm not, I'm just disappointed.

01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:13.640
I don't hate them.

01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:14.640
I'm disappointed.

01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:15.640
Okay?

01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:20.640
You know what?

01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:22.640
She's going to be cupping her booby in this one.

01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:31.640
I'm going to do the little puppy girl, puppy girl tail.

01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:33.640
Gotta get the puppy girl tail in.

01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:39.640
Um...

01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:42.640
I don't know how to draw hands, so...

01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:44.640
We're going to do...

01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:46.640
What the fuck is this thing?

01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:52.640
We're going to do the little, we're going to do Lego mitts.

01:25:59.640 --> 01:26:00.640
What was that?

01:26:01.640 --> 01:26:02.640
Okay.

01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:07.640
You know what?

01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:09.640
We're just going to stay with how we did this before.

01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:12.640
Abulous.

01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:17.640
And then I'll get the other fingers kind of in there.

01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:19.640
Is there a hand on backwards?

01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:21.640
Oh!

01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:23.640
Okay, I see what I did.

01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:26.640
Technically, this is her pinky and then this should be like shaded.

01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:30.640
Cause the thumbs are on the inside.

01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:37.640
Don't worry about it.

01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:39.640
Her hand's a little bit broken.

01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:40.640
Is she's naked?

01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:42.640
Um...

01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:44.640
Perhaps.

01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:46.640
Perhaps.

01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:50.640
No, she's not.

01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:52.640
She's just wearing a crop top.

01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:54.640
Okay.

01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:57.640
And it's really short shorts.

01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:01.640
She's very cute.

01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:03.640
Whoa.

01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:06.640
Very cute with some thickum thighs.

01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:28.640
I'm like just trying to...

01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:32.640
Like make or click her leg back.

01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:33.640
How about we just do this?

01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:34.640
Yeah, that's fine.

01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:40.640
I've never done an art stream.

01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:42.640
What the fuck do people do in art streams?

01:27:43.640 --> 01:27:45.640
Wow, fabulous.

01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:47.640
Oh, we love to see it.

01:27:47.640 --> 01:27:48.640
We're not drawing feet.

01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:50.640
You guys don't get that for free.

01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:55.640
He has legs for days.

01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:01.640
Yeah, no feet for you.

01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:02.640
You get a little paws.

01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:04.640
I'll give you some furry feet.

01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:16.640
You can get some furry feet.

01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:21.640
Bro, no feet dropped.

01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:28.640
Gorgeous.

01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:30.640
Am I right or am I right?

01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:35.640
Okay, let's put her off to the side.

01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:41.640
And now we're gonna try to draw something.

01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:44.640
I'm gonna stick you guys on top of each other.

01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:50.640
What should we try to draw?

01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:55.640
Give me an animal and then a theme.

01:28:56.640 --> 01:29:04.640
Like cat, gyaru, dog, goff, crocodile, dundee.

01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:06.640
You know what I mean?

01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:09.640
Why can't I erase?

01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:11.640
Why is it still racing?

01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:16.640
What is happening?

01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:17.640
I can't erase this.

01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:19.640
But I can delete it.

01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:20.640
Okay, that's fine.

01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:28.640
Bear, e-girl, hotel, travaga, dinosaur, cheerleader, goth ma.

01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:29.640
Ooh, I like goth ma.

01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:31.640
Slime, bimbo.

01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:36.640
It's not him.

01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:37.640
It's his cuttlefish.

01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:39.640
That actually kind of rhymes with it.

01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:40.640
I think about it.

01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:44.640
Brab, gyaru, secret agent, platypus.

01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:47.640
It's Barry the platypus.

01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:51.640
E-girl Barry the platypus, no.

01:29:52.640 --> 01:29:53.640
Dear Raver.

01:29:56.640 --> 01:29:57.640
I have to go.

01:29:57.640 --> 01:30:00.640
I think I'm gonna go with slime, bimbo, because that sounds fun.

01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:08.640
Because, you know, I need to get my slime girl fix at some point.

01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:09.640
Goth mad scientist.

01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:14.640
That's just, that's just Nova from before Mariah.

01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:21.640
Hold on.

01:30:21.640 --> 01:30:22.640
Let it cook.

01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:23.640
Let it cook.

01:30:26.640 --> 01:30:27.640
What is this fucking?

01:30:27.640 --> 01:30:28.640
Oh.

01:30:39.640 --> 01:30:40.640
Yeah.

01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:46.640
Noice.

01:30:49.640 --> 01:30:50.640
Anyways.

01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:54.640
Let's make that brush a little bit smaller.

01:30:54.640 --> 01:30:56.640
Slime girl's kind of...

01:30:57.640 --> 01:30:58.640
Slime girl's spit.

01:30:58.640 --> 01:30:59.640
Well, she made a spit.

01:30:59.640 --> 01:31:01.640
Oh, I have to find the art that I made of her.

01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:03.640
I think it's on my iPad.

01:31:03.640 --> 01:31:05.640
Yeah, it's on my iPad.

01:31:07.640 --> 01:31:09.640
I know I posted it on my PL at some point in the evening.

01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:12.640
I'll make a slime girl made out of blood.

01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:14.640
She's made out of period blood.

01:31:21.640 --> 01:31:24.640
Her name was saliva.

01:31:28.640 --> 01:31:30.640
She went by live.

01:31:31.640 --> 01:31:34.640
Her last name is Hawk Tua.

01:31:35.640 --> 01:31:36.640
Live Hawk Tua.

01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:45.640
Okay.

01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:47.640
Actually, I'm going to do a new canvas because...

01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:51.640
Is there a possibility?

01:31:51.640 --> 01:31:53.640
I don't know how this shit works.

01:31:54.640 --> 01:31:55.640
This is a wrench do.

01:31:57.640 --> 01:31:58.640
Okay.

01:31:59.640 --> 01:32:00.640
Can I do...

01:32:01.640 --> 01:32:02.640
3000?

01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:11.640
Cool.

01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:14.640
Okay, that looks a little bit better.

01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:18.640
Get real close, impersonal.

01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:20.640
Wow.

01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:23.640
I never done an Australian accent before, but I just did it.

01:32:23.640 --> 01:32:24.640
Impressive.

01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:27.640
Live Hawk Tua, my new...

01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:28.640
Oh, gee.

01:32:29.640 --> 01:32:30.640
That's one of my...

01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:32.640
That's my slime girl.

01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:33.640
All three goes live.

01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:34.640
Live Hawk Tua.

01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:41.640
Shabee is cooking and almost burned the kitchen.

01:32:41.640 --> 01:32:43.640
I was burned the kitchen, not the food.

01:32:43.640 --> 01:32:44.640
The kitchen.

01:32:45.640 --> 01:32:46.640
Better than Anita's.

01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:48.640
Okay.

01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:52.640
I'll sketch in light blue.

01:32:55.640 --> 01:32:56.640
Just to really get this...

01:32:56.640 --> 01:32:58.640
Oh, that's fucking neon.

01:32:58.640 --> 01:32:59.640
Never mind.

01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:00.640
I can't see that.

01:33:03.640 --> 01:33:04.640
Let's go back to red.

01:33:07.640 --> 01:33:08.640
Okay, I need...

01:33:09.640 --> 01:33:11.640
I'm not used to...

01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:15.640
Whoa.

01:33:18.640 --> 01:33:20.640
Dude on three.

01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:21.640
Okay, I think that's better.

01:33:23.640 --> 01:33:24.640
So...

01:33:27.640 --> 01:33:29.640
We're making a slime girl.

01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:31.640
Oh, see.

01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:32.640
She's a bimbo.

01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:33.640
Let me get closer.

01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:36.640
Real close and personal.

01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:37.640
Am I right?

01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:41.640
I can't draw eyes.

01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:42.640
Or faces.

01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:44.640
Or anything for that matter.

01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:49.640
Live Hawk Tua is the background character in a show

01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:50.640
where we come some sense with.

01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:51.640
Live being the jack of...

01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:52.640
No!

01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:54.640
I'm not drawing a jack of pose.

01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:57.640
I'm literally just going to draw a fucking T-pose or some shit.

01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:01.640
Again, I can't draw eyes.

01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:03.640
So...

01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:05.640
Bear with me.

01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:09.640
Because I tend to...

01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:12.640
If I'm looking at something...

01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:15.640
I also really only...

01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:20.640
When I did anime-styled characters,

01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:25.640
it was either in the cute and funny style

01:34:25.640 --> 01:34:26.640
or it was...

01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:28.640
Or it was...

01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:31.640
What's it called?

01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:33.640
Like the soul leader style.

01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:38.640
So I guess I'm just going to draw cute and funny bimbo.

01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:41.640
Slime girl.

01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:45.640
Let's see.

01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:52.640
Mm-hmm.

01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:16.640
Better be drooling.

01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:17.640
Okay, fine.

01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:19.640
I'll give her a worse...

01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:22.640
A better expression then.

01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:26.640
I gotta give her a fucking expression.

01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:32.640
Let's see.

01:35:51.640 --> 01:35:54.640
This looks like some kind of in her mouth.

01:35:57.640 --> 01:35:58.640
Yoiks.

01:36:05.640 --> 01:36:06.640
Put the eyes up too high.

01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:07.640

Kusugaki bratty expression, okay, I don't like this I feel like it should be bigger

01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:15.880
The thing I like about digital art is that I can like drag stuff and make them larger

01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:19.560
But I don't know how to do that

01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:25.160
How do I make this bigger scale? Oh, no, that's not it

01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:30.160
I mean you still I just like what I don't know how to resize something

01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:36.760
Let's make the eye closer and more up I suppose

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.680
How do I make this bigger edit?

01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:46.480
Is that just not a thing that you do and

01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:50.240
Whatever I don't care anymore

01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:52.400
I

01:39:55.280 --> 01:39:57.280
Need to cut it

01:39:57.920 --> 01:40:00.800
Drag the corner, what do you mean drag though fuck

01:40:02.040 --> 01:40:06.800
Don't worry about it. It's fine. It's fine. It's gonna race this weird fucking thing

01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:10.160
Actually, I'll do that

01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:22.400
Oh

01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:49.520
How to give her like the

01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:51.600
Damn, she looks like she's crying

01:40:55.760 --> 01:40:59.160
I'm never like satisfied with like specific eye styles

01:40:59.160 --> 01:41:01.160
I

01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:25.400
Gotta get the big boat lashes in it big boat lashes

01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:32.480
Simple is better with those tiny circles. Yeah, I'm kind of feeling the same thing

01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:36.840
Cuz this is looks like shit

01:41:41.320 --> 01:41:43.320
I prefer like a simpler

01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:49.440
Style when it comes to eyes. I realize I just can't do the

01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:52.360
Really fancy like eye rendering

01:41:53.160 --> 01:41:56.440
And I'll like read about how to do it and shit, but I just can't do it

01:41:59.720 --> 01:42:10.920
She looks like a fucking alien cuz her eyes are so far apart

01:42:12.840 --> 01:42:14.840
What the hell I hate it

01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:19.480
Get rid of it disgusting

01:42:20.840 --> 01:42:22.840
I don't know should I go disgusting shit

01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:31.400
Try again, we will make the slime girl. I promise you I'm just a very fussy artist

01:42:36.920 --> 01:42:41.560
Just kidding. I'm probably lying. I'm probably not gonna draw anything cuz I hate

01:42:44.600 --> 01:42:46.600
Anything that I draw

01:42:48.600 --> 01:42:52.680
See then I'm like, let's change the eye style up. Shall we you know

01:42:52.920 --> 01:42:54.920
and then

01:42:56.200 --> 01:42:58.200
Cuz I haven't been able to

01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:10.040
I haven't been able to find like a style that I like so that I can teach myself

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:15.560
It looks so amazing before too bad. I don't like it

01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:18.520
I

01:43:24.280 --> 01:43:28.360
Is is she gonna draw anything this stream? No, she's not

01:43:30.520 --> 01:43:32.520
Whatever made you think that

01:43:37.160 --> 01:43:40.120
I'm gonna have a blank canvas by the end perhaps

01:43:41.160 --> 01:43:43.160
Live I thought this was Hanukkah

01:43:44.120 --> 01:43:49.800
She's Jewish now. She's a Jewish slime girl. Okay, like

01:43:51.880 --> 01:43:53.880
She's a little melt in a little bit, you know

01:43:54.680 --> 01:43:59.480
Let's how about we now focus on the face we just focused on like her hair something

01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:02.600
That looks weird. I don't know why she did it like that

01:44:09.880 --> 01:44:11.400
So

01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:13.480
The hair kind of like goes

01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:17.640
Into itself when it comes to like slime girls, so I'm just gonna

01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:26.440
I'm I kind I'm kind of feeling a bayang, you know, I think we should do like a like a very like exaggerated

01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:30.280
Melty bayang. Yeah

01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:37.480
Yeah, I'm feeling that

01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:41.160
And then she's like emo she doesn't want to be here

01:44:41.800 --> 01:44:44.440
But wait, she's a bimbo. That doesn't really fit the theme

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.560
I'm feeling very inspired by like

01:44:59.960 --> 01:45:01.960
Elec from nicky

01:45:03.240 --> 01:45:06.840
Just want like a little bang moment, you know

01:45:12.360 --> 01:45:17.400
I just love like bangs that completely cover the eyes. That's all I can say. I don't know what to tell you

01:45:18.600 --> 01:45:21.480
It looks like I'm just drawing a slime ball. So I guess that works

01:45:22.200 --> 01:45:24.200
Like her to the wrong ball

01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:40.040
And then we'll just like kind of bring it over there we'll just drip a little bit over there, you know a little

01:45:41.640 --> 01:45:43.640
A

01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:52.040
This looks kind of gross, but you know, that's the best part am I right

01:45:55.560 --> 01:45:57.560
It looks definitely like a ball of spit

01:46:03.960 --> 01:46:09.240
It looks like something and she may have come you know, we'll never know

01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:14.840
Only a select few will know

01:46:29.880 --> 01:46:34.520
She's a jar slime. Oh, I like that. She's a bimbo jar slime

01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:41.000
Oh god

01:46:41.080 --> 01:46:47.880
What have I created? What have we made together? I can't believe you've done this

01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:03.800
Let's give her some cute ponytails, you know, we gotta

01:47:04.600 --> 01:47:06.600
We'll do like

01:47:06.680 --> 01:47:08.680
Little those cute

01:47:08.920 --> 01:47:10.920
All scrunchy things

01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:21.880
And then she'll just have a little melty ponytails, okay, I guess I'm just drawing a cute and funny bimbo slime

01:47:25.800 --> 01:47:27.800
I'm kind of feeling her though

01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:31.080
She's you know

01:47:32.520 --> 01:47:34.520
She's doing the most she can

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
I

01:47:43.240 --> 01:47:47.480
Drop drop a little okay, I got you

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:06.600
She's like kind of she doesn't have a brain this is her brain it's very smooth

01:48:06.760 --> 01:48:08.760
Enough

01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:15.960
Let's give her a cute little like she she tries to pin her hair up, but she can't

01:48:18.120 --> 01:48:20.120
That just looks fucking weird actually never mind

01:48:21.800 --> 01:48:23.800
We'll give her a

01:48:27.640 --> 01:48:31.800
We'll we'll work on the accessories we'll work on the accessories later

01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:37.080
I'm doing a new layer for the face

01:48:39.080 --> 01:48:41.080
Because I actually like what I have going on right here

01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:54.040
So we got we got to do like one giant big fucking eye like what

01:48:54.760 --> 01:48:56.760
Oh

01:48:58.360 --> 01:49:01.560
Like why did you put me in this jar on each hand?

01:49:06.200 --> 01:49:10.360
You're liking big braided bangs and long braided hair in the back

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
You think I can draw a braid

01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:21.160
She has hair sleep shaped slime that's what she's just made of slime, you know

01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:23.960
Damn what the fuck

01:49:33.480 --> 01:49:39.640
Okay, I'm liking this I'm liking it I think I don't know we'll keep going and find out

01:49:52.120 --> 01:49:54.120
Oh

01:49:56.280 --> 01:49:59.640
She kind of has a like a like a pissed off girl expression

01:50:07.240 --> 01:50:14.600
She's a she's a distant relative of straw knee, but she's like a like a slug like a sea slug made of slime

01:50:22.120 --> 01:50:36.920
She's like I really don't want to be here, bro. Like why did you take me to this weird ass mall?

01:50:38.280 --> 01:50:40.280
Let's give her freckles

01:50:40.520 --> 01:50:42.520
Now she's just emmy never mind

01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:44.840
She's just emmy covered in a jar, you know

01:50:45.720 --> 01:50:47.720
Ink v type of slime

01:50:47.720 --> 01:50:51.240
Ooh good point good point

01:51:17.720 --> 01:51:20.440
She's a slime girl audio cooking what I didn't know that

01:51:24.920 --> 01:51:27.560
Again I can't draw eyes so they just pissed me off

01:51:27.880 --> 01:51:32.600
Oh actually let me just erase like a normal human being

01:51:45.400 --> 01:51:47.400
You know what actually

01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:50.920
Obviously she has to have her tongue out, you know and then a little bit of

01:51:52.680 --> 01:51:54.680
A little bit of wool there, you know

01:51:55.160 --> 01:51:57.160

01:52:23.080 --> 01:52:25.080
Erase the eye start over

01:52:31.800 --> 01:52:38.600
I've seen you draw solid eyes like three times you're good. No, I'm not nothing's good here

01:52:44.040 --> 01:52:48.120
Although actually the way that was kind of looks like would be a cute pin area

01:52:50.440 --> 01:52:56.440
And then I could just be like this type of eye

01:53:05.960 --> 01:53:10.520
Might need to know erase her challenge is that a thing because I would not survive

01:53:14.520 --> 01:53:16.520
Thank you for the super

01:53:20.680 --> 01:53:24.120
I kind of want her to have like a oh you disgust me look on her face

01:53:38.120 --> 01:53:41.960

You can't go wrong with soul eater eyes

01:54:06.520 --> 01:54:08.520

You can't go wrong with them. They're just they're just they're just lovely, you know

01:54:17.080 --> 01:54:19.080
Oh, I don't like the color in the

But I also I don't like it

01:54:30.440 --> 01:54:32.440

01:56:24.920 --> 01:56:26.920
I don't know but I don't like it

01:56:32.440 --> 01:56:34.440
Haha

01:56:45.880 --> 01:56:51.000
Hello my child good luck with your drawing practice. You're the most proud of you. Ah, thank you, mom

01:56:52.120 --> 01:56:54.120
Thank you

01:56:54.440 --> 01:56:56.440
Oh

Please if you're a vtuber looking for amazing rigor art, please reach out to nars. She's

01:57:04.040 --> 01:57:06.040
That would not be who I am today

01:57:09.720 --> 01:57:11.720
The hips should be bigger

01:57:13.480 --> 01:57:17.720
She's pink you can give her a hair accessory that's a clove feather. That's actually really cute

01:57:19.560 --> 01:57:21.560
I actually like that

01:57:22.520 --> 01:57:24.520
She's like a ink

01:57:26.200 --> 01:57:28.200
Character

01:57:30.920 --> 01:57:32.920
I don't know proportions

01:57:35.640 --> 01:57:37.640
Should I make her o-fi

01:57:40.440 --> 01:57:43.400
I'm just I just want to draw boobs, but then I'm fighting against it

01:57:44.840 --> 01:57:47.240
Nari appreciation. Oh, it's nari love

01:57:48.200 --> 01:57:53.400
Nari's working on my tan twuggle. I'm so excited. I could be brown

01:57:56.520 --> 01:57:58.520
Um

01:57:59.320 --> 01:58:01.320
I kind of want to give her like

01:58:03.720 --> 01:58:06.840
I like to give her really long hair

01:58:09.560 --> 01:58:11.560
Give her like really longer

01:58:13.240 --> 01:58:15.240
Yeah

01:58:16.120 --> 01:58:19.640
I can't believe this would be this is making me wish I was drawing on an iPad again

01:58:21.160 --> 01:58:29.160
You see the editing the ears what you're getting there. Oh, yeah, that's right for some like not human ears because I was talking earlier about um

01:58:30.360 --> 01:58:36.440
I don't like double ears on a camomomimi. I can't pronounce the word like just animal people

01:58:39.320 --> 01:58:43.720
Maybe imagine slam girl thug shape what I don't know what that means

01:58:45.640 --> 01:58:47.640
Oh

01:58:47.880 --> 01:58:49.880
Okay, she's so she's got big

01:58:51.640 --> 01:58:53.640
Slimy hair

01:58:54.920 --> 01:58:57.880
She looks like she's kind of made out of water at this point. Um

01:59:06.200 --> 01:59:09.240
I think I need to I need to stretch out her body a little bit

01:59:15.560 --> 01:59:17.560
I

01:59:34.600 --> 01:59:36.600
Don't know what outfit together

01:59:42.120 --> 01:59:44.120
What would a bimbo slime girl wear

01:59:45.480 --> 01:59:47.480
What

01:59:51.560 --> 01:59:57.160
What what's what's this is like I like uh, for example, um

01:59:58.520 --> 02:00:00.520
Slimes were close nothing

02:00:02.440 --> 02:00:05.240
I can't draw her naked. Um

02:00:06.440 --> 02:00:08.440
What's it called? Uh

02:00:09.640 --> 02:00:13.640
It is helping me conceptualize like an outfit

02:00:13.880 --> 02:00:21.080
For like a future 2.0. This is very distant in the future, but I just love designing things and emi does too

02:00:21.240 --> 02:00:25.720
So we're just like kind of collabing on that because I like watching her um do her stream

02:00:26.760 --> 02:00:28.760
um

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:33.480
Like I like have ideas for things, but then it's just hard for me to bring them to life

02:00:35.080 --> 02:00:37.400
But like design designing is super fun

02:00:37.720 --> 02:00:45.080
Two top something waterproof, okay, I guess I'll just give her like a bathing suit

02:00:49.560 --> 02:00:54.040
Wait these these proportions ain't proportioning

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
She's gonna be oh bye

02:01:08.360 --> 02:01:10.360
I can't draw boobies

02:01:14.600 --> 02:01:20.920
I always remember someone's like draw them like like a little water bottle the water bottle water balloon

02:01:25.320 --> 02:01:27.480
High like swimsuit fey watch style

02:01:28.840 --> 02:01:32.440
Classic umbrella rain jacket material. Oh, that would be cute

02:01:32.840 --> 02:01:34.840
See like

02:01:36.840 --> 02:01:42.520
That's why I wish I was an artist because it was up to me. I'd be like, okay bathing suit the top

02:01:43.960 --> 02:01:45.960
Is like this

02:01:47.080 --> 02:01:49.320
And this is where her kuchi goes

02:01:50.520 --> 02:01:53.320
But then this part is like the plastic ski

02:01:54.280 --> 02:01:56.920
Shit from like a like a clear rain jacket

02:01:57.480 --> 02:02:01.080
And then have her wear a clear rain jacket

02:02:01.640 --> 02:02:06.840
Over this and then give her like really big boots like big rest rain boots

02:02:08.280 --> 02:02:10.280
And there you go

02:02:16.440 --> 02:02:18.440
But I think that would be cute

02:02:19.880 --> 02:02:21.880
But I can't draw plastic

02:02:24.760 --> 02:02:26.760
Perfection

02:02:26.840 --> 02:02:31.320
But you get but you get what I'm saying though, right like you get where I'm coming from

02:02:32.360 --> 02:02:34.360
You get you know what I mean

02:02:34.360 --> 02:02:36.600
You know what I mean jelly bean

02:02:37.320 --> 02:02:39.480
I'm not finishing an actual drawing by the end of the stream

02:02:39.480 --> 02:02:42.680
By the way, I hope you I hope you guys don't think I'm gonna finish a drawing because that's

02:02:43.560 --> 02:02:48.680
That's never gonna happen ever. I've never finished a drawing in my entire life that picture of um

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:55.240
Saliva is just sitting on my iPad only ahead

02:02:57.560 --> 02:03:02.760
Actually, let me see if I can just show you guys it

02:03:09.720 --> 02:03:11.720
Wait, but I posted it on my pl

02:03:13.080 --> 02:03:15.080
I don't know if I'm feeling logging into that again though

02:03:20.520 --> 02:03:22.520
It's time for a moment

02:03:22.680 --> 02:03:29.320
No top boots with the laces tied together around her neck to cover her bro, I just choked on my almond

02:03:32.280 --> 02:03:34.280
If she was pet time then yes

02:03:45.080 --> 02:03:47.080
It would just be like

02:03:47.080 --> 02:03:49.080
How about even fucking work

02:03:52.680 --> 02:03:58.200
Somebody said hi leg so we'll do some hi leg

02:04:13.080 --> 02:04:15.160
I was literally about to say is in me streaming

02:04:16.840 --> 02:04:19.480
Because I want to read her then I realize she's not here

02:04:19.720 --> 02:04:21.720
Oh

02:04:27.160 --> 02:04:29.240
I'm gonna miss her although I get to still talk to her

02:04:31.880 --> 02:04:37.000
I see if you taking her quest no, especially not from grain aims

02:04:42.840 --> 02:04:48.040
You can always start changing that never finishing anything you time and feel like it. Yeah, that's a good point

02:04:49.560 --> 02:04:51.560
I

02:04:53.080 --> 02:04:59.160
These almonds are so good. It's a nice healthy snack. Just almonds. I recommend it

02:05:02.680 --> 02:05:06.200
Let's fire that great. No, I just like to pick on people sometimes. I don't really care

02:05:20.200 --> 02:05:22.200

02:07:38.840 --> 02:07:40.840

I don't love anybody I only love my cats and that's it. I don't even love myself

02:08:28.360 --> 02:08:31.720
Almond's making her too. No, I think it's because I had a bowl of cereal earlier

02:08:32.440 --> 02:08:35.880
I've only had a bowl of cereal in almonds today. What the fuck is wrong with me?

02:08:35.880 --> 02:08:37.880
I

02:08:38.120 --> 02:08:41.800
In fact, I put these almonds away. I feel like it's like not good to have too many almonds

02:08:47.960 --> 02:08:49.960
Every time I see your name

02:08:50.440 --> 02:08:56.360

02:09:06.120 --> 02:09:08.120
Thank you

02:09:22.920 --> 02:09:24.680
Also, um

02:09:28.360 --> 02:09:31.080
I miscalculated how much money I had in my bank account

02:09:33.240 --> 02:09:35.240
And I thought I had like

02:09:35.720 --> 02:09:37.320
enough

02:09:37.320 --> 02:09:39.320
to like

02:09:40.200 --> 02:09:43.800
Like and I have groceries and stuff too, but like I was like I and I don't feel like make anything

02:09:43.800 --> 02:09:50.040
Let me worry about but I had already ordered art from somebody that was like 90 dollars and then I'm like, oh wait

02:09:50.280 --> 02:09:52.280
My account is negative two dollars

02:09:58.520 --> 02:10:01.800
Mom, would you say that you're still the first person I'd like you membership to

02:10:02.680 --> 02:10:04.680
Oh, that's very sweet. Thank you

02:10:05.960 --> 02:10:07.960
What's up?

02:10:08.680 --> 02:10:14.120
Excuse me girl, man. There's much cereal you eat. You should already go to natural resistance to lack

02:10:16.920 --> 02:10:21.400
I actually don't eat cereal that often. I just only got cereal the last time with grocery shopping

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000
Um

02:10:25.960 --> 02:10:27.960
Okay, I'm

02:10:28.680 --> 02:10:30.680
Another

02:10:36.120 --> 02:10:38.120
And um

02:10:41.560 --> 02:10:43.560
What was I gonna say?

02:10:44.040 --> 02:10:47.560
Um, oh, yeah, because I just saw it. I'm like, oh I haven't had cereal

02:10:48.680 --> 02:10:53.160
I'm like, uh, I probably shouldn't get cereal because I don't have any I haven't I shouldn't really be drinking milk

02:10:53.160 --> 02:10:56.600
And I'm like, I don't really care. It's easy to do. You're just pour milk in a bowl

02:10:57.400 --> 02:11:01.720
So I got it. I got some ohs and some shiriyos and I like to make some together

02:11:03.720 --> 02:11:09.400
Um, I also didn't do as much grocery shopping as I wanted to because like I said the supermarket when I went

02:11:09.720 --> 02:11:13.400
All their whole like frozen food section was gone. Well, not like gone

02:11:13.480 --> 02:11:15.640
it was just like out of order because the

02:11:16.600 --> 02:11:18.600
the power was out

02:11:19.320 --> 02:11:22.920
and um, because normally I'll get like some like oh I'll get some like

02:11:23.640 --> 02:11:27.560
Uh, like salmon frozen that I just usually throw in an air fryer

02:11:28.200 --> 02:11:35.560
Um, or I'll get some like chicky tendies or I'll get some like grilled chicken and then I'll like usually get like salad kits. Um

02:11:36.760 --> 02:11:40.440
and like other like, uh, like vegetables and stuff

02:11:41.080 --> 02:11:43.080
to put together

02:11:43.080 --> 02:11:47.640
with the food but all their the whole frozen section was like destroyed so I was just like

02:11:48.600 --> 02:11:54.600
Like I got syrup then I got home and I'm like wait, I don't have any I don't have any waffles for this syrup

02:11:55.560 --> 02:12:02.120
So it sucked and tolerant to let me yes, I used to not be but then I stopped drinking milk for a long time during covid

02:12:02.520 --> 02:12:04.520
For some reason. I don't even know why

02:12:05.080 --> 02:12:07.800
and then I just like couldn't drink milk again

02:12:11.480 --> 02:12:16.280
Uh, I fell in a rush to joke society somewhere near from barfolk and flooded diamond

02:12:16.520 --> 02:12:18.520
Oh, that'd be cool actually

02:12:21.080 --> 02:12:26.360
Don't you hear how there's never the right amount of cereal to milk creation? Yeah, I agree with that. That's pretty difficult

02:12:27.080 --> 02:12:29.080
um, because I usually like

02:12:29.320 --> 02:12:31.320
I'll usually like get enough milk

02:12:32.600 --> 02:12:36.760
And I'll think I got enough cereal, but then it looks like I'm overflowing the bowl with too much cereal

02:12:37.400 --> 02:12:38.840
and then I like

02:12:38.840 --> 02:12:43.880
Get a little bit of cereal out and then I'm like, oh wait, maybe it needs more milk and then yeah, I just

02:12:44.840 --> 02:12:47.960
Please no more 12 hour salmon. What do you mean? It was delicious

02:12:50.280 --> 02:12:54.040
I totally had forgotten I left it out to defrost in like some water

02:12:54.760 --> 02:12:58.120
But it was like it was it was covered. It was fine

02:12:59.240 --> 02:13:01.240
And it was sitting in a pot in my

02:13:04.200 --> 02:13:08.760
Just you know, yeah, I was aged 12 hours to perfection what sauce with attendees

02:13:09.720 --> 02:13:16.120
I have this thing, you know, you need to go to the grocery store and there's always something you accidentally buy too much of

02:13:16.840 --> 02:13:18.840
minus condiments

02:13:20.440 --> 02:13:27.080
Like I'll be like, oh, I probably need this and then I'm like, wait, I already have like two bottles in my fridge

02:13:28.680 --> 02:13:30.680
Don't worry, she should be 56

02:13:31.640 --> 02:13:33.080
um

02:13:33.080 --> 02:13:37.800
Each salmon sounds so wrong. Hey, you can age a steak. I've had dry aged steak

02:13:38.360 --> 02:13:42.440
Um, I don't yeah, I don't know and like you can make like salmon jerky

02:13:50.920 --> 02:13:57.320
I have kids don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. Uh bodies change as we get older. Yeah at the ripe age of

02:13:58.200 --> 02:14:00.920
56 my totally real age. Um

02:14:02.040 --> 02:14:06.120
I'm just my body is just shutting down. I'm probably on the verge of death

02:14:07.800 --> 02:14:09.800
Ha ha ha

02:14:09.800 --> 02:14:11.800
Wet aged salmon

02:14:13.560 --> 02:14:17.320
How does it use to eat shrimp all the time hit 30 and he's allergic that sucks

02:14:17.960 --> 02:14:19.560
That sucks. So like I love seafood

02:14:19.560 --> 02:14:25.000
I love seafood since I was a kid when I was younger at my mom would get annoyed with me because we go to a restaurant as like a special

02:14:25.240 --> 02:14:31.880
Special little treat and I try to order like the shrimp scampi or like a lobster dish at age like seven

02:14:33.080 --> 02:14:36.200
Because I just love seafood so much and I still do

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:38.440
um

02:14:38.440 --> 02:14:42.280
And if if I was allergic to shellfish, I would probably cry

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000
I would probably just curb it

02:14:45.240 --> 02:14:48.120
Uh minecraft myself exactly same

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000
So just give me chills

02:14:51.160 --> 02:14:55.240
Man a few streams ago you mentioned emi making you crave jerky. So I ended up getting jerky as well

02:14:55.240 --> 02:14:57.240
And I got jerky when I went grocery shopping

02:14:58.280 --> 02:15:03.640
Emi's just a trend center. I don't know what to tell you my little cute sister is just so influential

02:15:04.280 --> 02:15:06.120
um

02:15:06.280 --> 02:15:08.280
On the verge of digging the forbidden hole

02:15:09.720 --> 02:15:12.760
I like however coming up with all these analogies for dying

02:15:14.120 --> 02:15:17.480
Why the fuck you dying your t-shirts, of course

02:15:18.200 --> 02:15:20.200
We're doing tie-dye

02:15:20.280 --> 02:15:23.240
Tie-dice. Ooh tie-dye hand cam stream

02:15:24.040 --> 02:15:25.320
yo

02:15:25.320 --> 02:15:27.320
You can cost so much you right

02:15:27.640 --> 02:15:29.640
I'm about to put jerky upon my throat

02:15:30.360 --> 02:15:34.600
I'm sorry to go. No, I want more jerky. I bought my own jerky though

02:15:35.560 --> 02:15:37.560
Came ending

02:15:37.560 --> 02:15:44.040
Well being allergic to shellfish shrimp is tasty worth it. Um the only thing I think I might be allergic to is kiwis

02:15:44.360 --> 02:15:45.400
Which is just weird

02:15:45.400 --> 02:15:52.200
I don't understand why I would be allergic to kiwis because I'll have a kiwi and I've eaten kiwis like my entire life

02:15:52.520 --> 02:15:55.160
But I was telling someone and they're just like

02:15:56.120 --> 02:16:03.800
I'm like, oh, I love it how like kiwis are almost like spicy like almost like they're carbonated and like sizzle in your mouth and then someone was just like

02:16:05.160 --> 02:16:08.440
That's not supposed to happen when you eat a kiwi and I'm like

02:16:10.040 --> 02:16:12.040
Uh, no

02:16:13.320 --> 02:16:17.800
I'm like that isn't that like it's like, you know, like it's like almost sour. They're like, no

02:16:18.760 --> 02:16:20.120
that's

02:16:20.120 --> 02:16:26.280
That's you're allergic and I'm like, oh that sucks and then I just kept eating a kiwi because it's not like it doesn't affect me affect me

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:28.040
um

02:16:28.040 --> 02:16:30.600
And then my life ended when I found out I was allergic to rabbits

02:16:30.600 --> 02:16:33.240
That was that was actually an actual travesty

02:16:33.800 --> 02:16:37.400
Because rabbits are so cute and I almost died while petting one

02:16:38.440 --> 02:16:43.720
Because I just if I touched I touched my face after uh spending time with a rabbit

02:16:44.600 --> 02:16:48.680
And my throat started to close and that was the only time I felt pure panic

02:16:49.720 --> 02:16:51.720
um

02:16:55.720 --> 02:16:58.920
As I choke my mouth is tinky anyways

02:17:01.560 --> 02:17:04.680
Here's my oh there's a stylus. I'm like, where'd it go?

02:17:05.960 --> 02:17:10.760
Okay, let's zoom in. Let's let's go to the next step of this lovely

02:17:11.480 --> 02:17:13.240
whoa

02:17:13.240 --> 02:17:14.680

02:17:14.680 --> 02:17:20.440
Which is line art because you know, we're finished here. She looks great. She's

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.480
You know, she might be a little bit of a chicken nugget

02:17:24.440 --> 02:17:26.440
Hi

02:17:30.040 --> 02:17:32.040
Actually, I don't want to look at her

02:17:34.040 --> 02:17:36.040
Let's get rid of her

02:17:39.960 --> 02:17:44.440
Let's let's draw with blue. Yeah, that's nice

02:17:45.240 --> 02:17:47.240
I

02:17:49.800 --> 02:17:51.800
I mean for what a nugget you guys didn't know before

02:17:58.360 --> 02:18:03.080
Our vtubers talking about nugget what you don't like chicken nuggets sideswipe prime

02:18:03.160 --> 02:18:05.160
I

02:18:05.160 --> 02:18:07.160

When people ask me if I if I know the sauce or if I got the sauce, I I am saucing

02:21:32.040 --> 02:21:34.040
I am constantly saucing

02:21:35.800 --> 02:21:40.200
Special, yeah, I just have I just have come in my fridge. That's totally what the special sauce is

02:21:40.840 --> 02:21:44.200
As a fellow sauce enthusiast, there's no such thing as too many condiments

02:21:44.840 --> 02:21:48.360
A fridge with condiments is not me. I got it from

02:21:49.640 --> 02:21:52.600
Sausage, yeah, I could survive purely on sauces

02:21:54.200 --> 02:21:59.080
Where's the lamb sauce? What the fuck is lamb sauce? Oh, is that like a Gordon Ramsay reference?

02:22:00.040 --> 02:22:06.600
Well, worst case scenario, you could just drink condiments. Yep, lost in the sauce. Thank you

02:22:08.600 --> 02:22:13.000
Oh my god, my ear just got really fucking itchy. Don't you get it when your ear just gets really tickly all of a sudden?

02:22:20.120 --> 02:22:24.120
Okay, over here. I'm alive. My sauce stuck. Sausage buck

02:22:48.840 --> 02:22:52.760

Like don't know why I can't but I can't

02:23:01.240 --> 02:23:04.280
It's very difficult for me to draw my own hair

02:23:05.960 --> 02:23:11.640
Sauce and the damn lost skill issues. That's a sign of spider infestation. What?

02:23:12.920 --> 02:23:14.920
What do you mean?

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:19.240
What does that mean? So, so spider infestation

02:23:19.560 --> 02:23:21.560
I

02:23:21.800 --> 02:23:26.760
Think his hair is one wow. All right. What the fuck is this shape then?

02:23:31.160 --> 02:23:33.160
What is that shape, huh? Tell me

02:23:34.520 --> 02:23:39.000
Tell me I just want to draw really inappropriate things. I'll be honest with you, but I can't because

02:23:40.600 --> 02:23:42.600
Where on YouTube? Um

02:23:43.560 --> 02:23:45.800
So like let me draw my hair like

02:23:46.760 --> 02:23:48.760
I like how my bangs are asymmetrical

02:23:52.120 --> 02:23:56.680
And then I got a little bit of that a little like a little vampire fang moment

02:23:58.280 --> 02:24:00.760
Oh, I accidentally pressed a button

02:24:03.160 --> 02:24:06.040
What the hell what the hell

02:24:07.720 --> 02:24:09.880
Bro, I can't even do my little side thing

02:24:18.600 --> 02:24:20.600

02:24:20.760 --> 02:24:23.000
Be not afraid. This looks like a cat ear

02:24:25.480 --> 02:24:27.480
And I'm just turning myself into a fox girl

02:24:29.240 --> 02:24:34.040
Can you draw the hair a mascot? No, I can't

02:24:39.880 --> 02:24:41.880
I

02:24:55.880 --> 02:24:57.880
Got a little like

Mercy's hair is in

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:53.000
Isn't a ponytail

02:33:53.560 --> 02:33:55.960
People think her hair. I thought her hair was up

02:33:56.520 --> 02:34:00.520
I mean, I thought her hair was down, but it's actually in a ponytail held by the

02:34:05.800 --> 02:34:07.800
And tada

And I can't remember what your hair looks like up top of my head and then we got the eye patch

02:34:14.280 --> 02:34:16.280

02:34:36.360 --> 02:34:38.360
This is her bow

02:34:38.680 --> 02:34:40.680
That's your bow

02:34:51.560 --> 02:34:53.560
Those cheeks flap and

02:34:53.560 --> 02:34:55.560
Straight off a DC comic

02:34:56.440 --> 02:35:02.280
Yeah, this is nice. Um, in fact, sure. I'll draw icy off of that

02:35:02.840 --> 02:35:07.640
I have really bad memories of what my gen mates and everybody looks like to be honest. Um

02:35:08.440 --> 02:35:10.440
Oh my god, I need to

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:14.600
Pull my pants down. Sorry. I know that sounds weird, but they were like writing up

02:35:15.800 --> 02:35:17.960
Uh, okay, so I'll draw

02:35:23.480 --> 02:35:25.480
You look so happy to be honest

02:35:26.600 --> 02:35:30.280
I see with the wings. Okay, so this is icy

02:35:31.720 --> 02:35:33.720
Can't remember how her bangs work

02:35:34.360 --> 02:35:36.600
But she got a little polar bear ears

02:35:37.560 --> 02:35:39.560
Your hair is short

02:35:44.680 --> 02:35:47.960
You know, gotta give her the the evil look, um

02:35:49.560 --> 02:35:51.560
And then

02:35:51.640 --> 02:35:53.640
Gotta give her her little vest

02:35:54.840 --> 02:35:58.760
She looks like the fucking monkey from a land

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:09.000
Safety abster

02:36:12.360 --> 02:36:15.800
Please don't hurt me snowberries. Um, thank you

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:21.000
Who is this sassy little child? I'll give her her little booby bumps

02:36:21.640 --> 02:36:23.640
Little mosquito bites

02:36:23.880 --> 02:36:27.320
Um, and it's kind of like a puff jacket. So these are the little puffs

02:36:29.800 --> 02:36:31.800
Those are the puffs, okay

02:36:32.680 --> 02:36:35.240
Um, is there fur on it? I can't remember it. Let's just

02:36:35.640 --> 02:36:38.600
No, yeah, this I think there's like fur on the top or is that's Emmy

02:36:38.600 --> 02:36:41.880
I can't remember. I don't know why both girls are wearing vests, but they are

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:45.480
Oh, and then we got the spats

02:36:46.680 --> 02:36:48.680
Then she has like a belt thingy

02:36:49.640 --> 02:36:51.640
And then she got some thick thighs

02:36:57.240 --> 02:36:59.240
And then she got a little boots

02:36:59.400 --> 02:37:05.000
She's kind of looking a little bit masculine, so let me get

02:37:08.200 --> 02:37:10.600
She's blushing that looks like a mustache

02:37:12.520 --> 02:37:17.480
Okay, and she has a tail you can't really see it, but I'm gonna put her off to the side. It looks like a wee wee never mind

02:37:18.520 --> 02:37:20.920
Um, but yeah, that's and she's got like

02:37:22.040 --> 02:37:24.040
I realize her her

02:37:24.120 --> 02:37:26.120
It's it's supposed to be shorter

02:37:26.840 --> 02:37:28.840
Let me just cut this off

02:37:29.960 --> 02:37:36.600
Because then she has the the bite mark and then her tights

02:37:38.680 --> 02:37:44.440
And then they're ripped and you guys can clearly tell that they're ripped, right? Okay, let me call these spats in

02:37:45.400 --> 02:37:47.000
That's icy

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:49.000
It's one to one exactly

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:54.440
It looks just it looks just like her. Um, I'll put straw knee over this side

02:37:56.280 --> 02:37:58.280
Uh, and this is straw knee

02:38:00.200 --> 02:38:02.200
Um

What's the scotland flag look like

02:38:05.880 --> 02:38:07.880
It's gonna give her a scotland flag mask

02:38:08.360 --> 02:38:12.280
Um, this is straw knee. Hold on. Let me give her give her some

02:38:13.160 --> 02:38:18.520
What the fuck? I just gave her like a black eye. Um, let me give her some more seductive eyes, you know

Um, and then she has the bayang

02:38:46.040 --> 02:38:49.800
And I can't remember what her little side things look like but they're like that. I think it's like

02:38:50.680 --> 02:38:51.800
Yeah

02:38:51.800 --> 02:38:59.960
And then she's got her little weird shells that I thought were her ears for the longest time when I first saw her model until recently and she was just like no

02:39:01.240 --> 02:39:03.560
I'm actually impressed at how much this looks like her. Um

02:39:04.680 --> 02:39:07.080
And then she has like a little like pom-pom thing at the end

02:39:07.880 --> 02:39:13.800
It's not a pom-pom. It's the rest of her thing. Um, what is her outfit look like she has a yukata

02:39:15.800 --> 02:39:17.800
Um

And then she has like the thing that holds up her titties

02:39:34.920 --> 02:39:38.920
By the way, that's a push-up bra if you guys didn't know, um

02:39:40.360 --> 02:39:42.360
I think I just exposed my mother

02:39:42.520 --> 02:39:49.480
She's got that snatched waist. She's got the little, you know band-aid moment

02:39:51.320 --> 02:39:53.320
I don't know what the fuck that is. Um

02:40:02.280 --> 02:40:05.800
I know that was supposed to be part of her dress, but now it's her body

02:40:12.600 --> 02:40:14.600
Oh

02:40:24.120 --> 02:40:29.880
Wait, no, no, that's not that's that's Aladdin. What the fuck is that? Why do I'm Aladdin on the mind?

02:40:31.640 --> 02:40:33.640
Uh, that's the song

02:40:36.360 --> 02:40:42.120
Up where they walk up where they run up where they play all day

02:40:42.520 --> 02:40:47.560
The sun wandering free wish I could be

02:40:48.520 --> 02:40:50.520

I want to see you want to see him dancing walking around on those

02:41:08.360 --> 02:41:10.360

02:41:52.360 --> 02:41:58.040
Um, give her a little she's not even a fish. She's just I'm gonna say she's a squid. She's a cuttlefish

02:41:58.360 --> 02:42:03.160
Um, you know, these are all little tentacles. They'll give her so that it's an indicator

02:42:04.120 --> 02:42:06.120

That looks like little weird things coming off. Um, and then I always forget that her hair is long

02:46:34.680 --> 02:46:39.800
So like her hair is actually super fucking long. Um, let me make her

02:46:42.600 --> 02:46:44.600
Ender

02:46:49.160 --> 02:46:52.680
And ever she's a never climbed the position. Oh, shit

02:46:53.240 --> 02:46:55.240
Her body is all kind of fit

02:46:57.240 --> 02:46:59.240
I can't remember what an outfit is

02:47:00.680 --> 02:47:03.560
This mom goes, yeah, um, that's

02:47:07.160 --> 02:47:14.440
I'm trying. I was trying. This is her legs and then this is the little thing and it like goes down

02:47:14.760 --> 02:47:16.760
And it like goes down

02:47:18.760 --> 02:47:20.760
I can't remember

02:47:21.400 --> 02:47:23.640
Um, and she has her little head pieces

02:47:27.400 --> 02:47:29.400
And she has her little nose thing

02:47:34.920 --> 02:47:37.160
This is her after getting tilted at

02:47:39.800 --> 02:47:41.800
At the game

02:47:41.880 --> 02:47:47.240
I'll draw her leg up here. This is her thigh and that's her calf. Um, and this is her other leg

02:47:47.720 --> 02:47:52.440
Wait, why is her leg spread? Um, don't worry about it. Okay, let's put this leg down

02:47:53.880 --> 02:47:55.880
That looks wrong. Um

02:47:56.440 --> 02:48:01.480
Erase erase erase erase erase erase erase erase it get rid of it get rid of it. Um

02:48:03.080 --> 02:48:07.320
Again, I can't I have a horrible memory. I can't even remember what I look like half the time

02:48:07.880 --> 02:48:10.360
Uh, IRL or otherwise. So that's

02:48:12.760 --> 02:48:15.480
I'm gonna give her a cool veil because she's sultry

02:48:16.280 --> 02:48:17.720
and

02:48:17.720 --> 02:48:20.920
I'm cutting off her belly and I'm giving her a belly ring

02:48:22.040 --> 02:48:24.600
And her nippies are poking. Um, never mind

02:48:25.880 --> 02:48:29.480
She looks so angry. This looks like a giant burp emanating from her

02:48:31.160 --> 02:48:33.560
Bleeding hearts blat

02:48:35.240 --> 02:48:38.680

02:54:03.400 --> 02:54:04.400
Great stream.

02:54:04.400 --> 02:54:09.400
What do you mean, great stream? Am I ending? Are you ending my stream for me?

02:54:10.400 --> 02:54:11.400
You're really close.

02:54:21.400 --> 02:54:22.400
I smell nice.

02:54:26.400 --> 02:54:27.400
Stop.

02:54:30.400 --> 02:54:31.400

Stop.

02:54:38.400 --> 02:54:40.400
Am I E.B.? I don't know if I'm E.B.

02:54:41.400 --> 02:54:43.400
I might be a little E.B.

02:54:44.400 --> 02:54:48.400
Maybe I'm over tired. I don't know.

02:54:49.400 --> 02:54:51.400
Adam acts like a creepy asmr.

02:54:51.400 --> 02:54:57.400
Hey, do you mind leaning forward?

02:54:58.400 --> 02:54:59.400
Yeah.

02:55:00.400 --> 02:55:07.400
I'm just gonna put my camera right at this thing. Perfect. Don't move. No, it's fine.

02:55:09.400 --> 02:55:11.400
Why am I trying to get an upskirt shot? No, it doesn't matter.

02:55:14.400 --> 02:55:18.400
Your stream. What are you doing in my swamp?

02:55:19.400 --> 02:55:21.400
E.B. wants to smell your hair.

02:55:34.400 --> 02:55:38.400
Oh, that's a good one.

02:55:41.400 --> 02:55:42.400
Wow.

02:55:43.400 --> 02:55:48.400
Oh, by the way, so I was gonna, I'll probably mostly look up scripts.

02:55:48.400 --> 02:55:50.400
I just realized something about my eyes.

02:55:53.400 --> 02:55:55.400
One of my eyes is darker than the other.

02:55:58.400 --> 02:55:59.400
What?

02:56:00.400 --> 02:56:03.400
Like my light shine. One is white and one is not.

02:56:07.400 --> 02:56:10.400
What the fuck? But then it goes normal.

02:56:10.400 --> 02:56:12.400
And then it goes dark.

02:56:13.400 --> 02:56:14.400
What?

02:56:15.400 --> 02:56:16.400
Why does it work?

02:56:18.400 --> 02:56:21.400
Why does it get darker? And why does the other one stay bright?

02:56:22.400 --> 02:56:23.400
Sorry.

02:56:24.400 --> 02:56:27.400
Wait, we're just supposed to focus on my eyes? Yeah, focus on my eyes.

02:56:34.400 --> 02:56:35.400
Focus on my eyes.

02:56:37.400 --> 02:56:38.400
Focus.

02:56:39.400 --> 02:56:40.400
Focus on my eyes.

02:56:42.400 --> 02:56:43.400
Focus on my eyes.

02:56:44.400 --> 02:56:45.400
Are you focusing?

02:56:51.400 --> 02:56:53.400
Okay, I'm fine. I swear I'm fine. I'm swear.

02:56:56.400 --> 02:56:57.400
I look scary, y'all.

02:56:59.400 --> 02:57:03.400
Hello. Hi. It's me.

02:57:04.400 --> 02:57:05.400
My name is E.B.

02:57:06.400 --> 02:57:07.400
Hi.

02:57:08.400 --> 02:57:09.400
Hello.

02:57:12.400 --> 02:57:15.400
Yeah, one is under the shadow layer. Yeah, that's what it is.

02:57:16.400 --> 02:57:17.400
I know.

02:57:18.400 --> 02:57:20.400
You know, can I smell you?

02:57:21.400 --> 02:57:22.400
Can I smell you?

02:57:23.400 --> 02:57:24.400
All right.

02:57:25.400 --> 02:57:27.400
Can I get a little sniff?

02:57:28.400 --> 02:57:29.400
Please.

02:57:31.400 --> 02:57:32.400
Please.

02:57:34.400 --> 02:57:35.400
Okay.

02:57:35.400 --> 02:57:36.400
Okay.

02:57:41.400 --> 02:57:42.400
That's nice.

02:57:47.400 --> 02:57:48.400
What am I doing there?

02:58:05.400 --> 02:58:06.400
Okay.

02:58:16.400 --> 02:58:17.400
Okay.

02:58:19.400 --> 02:58:21.400
Was that the correct thing?

02:58:22.400 --> 02:58:24.400
Yeah, was that a lip-hoc to the moment?

02:58:29.400 --> 02:58:32.400
Can't wait for everyone's memberships to vanish this week.

02:58:32.400 --> 02:58:33.400
What are you talking about?

02:58:36.400 --> 02:58:39.400
They want to be a part of this. Are you kidding me right now?

02:58:45.400 --> 02:58:47.400
Wow, you can really see the teeth from the back of my mouth.

02:58:52.400 --> 02:58:53.400
Mama, mama, mama.

02:58:53.400 --> 02:58:54.400
There is your phone.

02:58:58.400 --> 02:58:59.400
Yeah, they're paying double.

02:59:01.400 --> 02:59:04.400
If you went into this, then you fucking tripping, boy.

02:59:06.400 --> 02:59:08.400
Why the fuck would I nuke the vase?

02:59:09.400 --> 02:59:10.400
I was clearing my throat.

02:59:16.400 --> 02:59:17.400
See?

02:59:19.400 --> 02:59:20.400
When you do voice acting,

02:59:22.400 --> 02:59:26.400
and you do a lot of talking for a living,

02:59:27.400 --> 02:59:29.400
I gotta clear my throat pretty often.

02:59:30.400 --> 02:59:31.400
Delicious.

02:59:39.400 --> 02:59:40.400
I have to fart.

02:59:55.400 --> 02:59:57.400
Thank God I muted.

02:59:59.400 --> 03:00:00.400
Thank God I muted.

03:00:12.400 --> 03:00:13.400
That was crazy.

03:00:14.400 --> 03:00:15.400
That was crazy, bro.

03:00:16.400 --> 03:00:17.400
Oh my God.

03:00:19.400 --> 03:00:20.400
If you guys...

03:00:23.400 --> 03:00:25.400
If I unmuted that,

03:00:26.400 --> 03:00:28.400
Far Bros would be eating so good.

03:00:34.400 --> 03:00:35.400
Yes, it did.

03:00:35.400 --> 03:00:38.400
What I hate about being a woman is that sometimes

03:00:39.400 --> 03:00:40.400
you have to...

03:00:41.400 --> 03:00:42.400
Well, you don't have to,

03:00:42.400 --> 03:00:43.400
but it just happens.

03:00:43.400 --> 03:00:44.400
You clearly can't control it.

03:00:44.400 --> 03:00:45.400
Sometimes you too,

03:00:45.400 --> 03:00:47.400
and it goes towards the front

03:00:50.400 --> 03:00:51.400
and says,

03:00:51.400 --> 03:00:54.400
pardon me, excuse me, towards your front bits.

03:00:55.400 --> 03:00:56.400
And then,

03:00:56.400 --> 03:00:58.400
those like to talk and speak up.

03:00:59.400 --> 03:01:02.400
So, she says she needs to confirm.

03:01:02.400 --> 03:01:04.400
But it's not a qui.

03:01:05.400 --> 03:01:06.400
It's not a bon qui qui.

03:01:06.400 --> 03:01:07.400
It's not what that is,

03:01:07.400 --> 03:01:10.400
because that's when air comes out of your qui qui, you know?

03:01:11.400 --> 03:01:12.400
But it takes a...

03:01:12.400 --> 03:01:13.400
You thought that was a myth?

03:01:13.400 --> 03:01:14.400
No!

03:01:14.400 --> 03:01:16.400
It's just like the way that you sit and the pressure,

03:01:19.400 --> 03:01:20.400
it'll just go to the front.

03:01:22.400 --> 03:01:23.400
It'll still come out of the back,

03:01:23.400 --> 03:01:24.400
it'll go to the front.

03:01:24.400 --> 03:01:25.400
It's like wings flapping.

03:01:25.400 --> 03:01:26.400
Yeah.

03:01:28.400 --> 03:01:29.400
It's literally what it sounds like,

03:01:29.400 --> 03:01:30.400
except fart version.

03:01:32.400 --> 03:01:33.400
I'm not here for quiffanonic.

03:01:34.400 --> 03:01:35.400
You're not?

03:01:39.400 --> 03:01:40.400
Oh, that's real too,

03:01:40.400 --> 03:01:41.400
because you can just get air up there.

03:01:44.400 --> 03:01:45.400
Especially

03:01:47.400 --> 03:01:49.400
if you're like hanging out,

03:01:49.400 --> 03:01:51.400
playing with your Barbie dolls,

03:01:52.400 --> 03:01:54.400
and a Barbie doll is like really big.

03:01:55.400 --> 03:01:56.400
Excuse me.

03:01:56.400 --> 03:01:57.400
It can push air.

03:02:00.400 --> 03:02:02.400
And then it will say in a Barbie voice,

03:02:03.400 --> 03:02:04.400
qui!

03:02:04.400 --> 03:02:05.400
And then you're like, whoa!

03:02:06.400 --> 03:02:07.400
Didn't expect that.

03:02:11.400 --> 03:02:12.400
It comes out of the back,

03:02:12.400 --> 03:02:13.400
travels across the chair

03:02:13.400 --> 03:02:16.400
and flaps the front on the left eye.

03:02:18.400 --> 03:02:19.400
And we were about to hear it.

03:02:19.400 --> 03:02:20.400
I'm also because I'm sweating.

03:02:20.400 --> 03:02:22.400
My apartment's so hot right now.

03:02:24.400 --> 03:02:25.400
She's a woman of elegance.

03:02:28.400 --> 03:02:29.400
There's a lot of many talents.

03:02:30.400 --> 03:02:32.400
I can be very elegant and proper.

03:02:33.400 --> 03:02:36.400
I can be so proper and motherly,

03:02:36.400 --> 03:02:38.400
and I don't know what you're talking about.

03:02:39.400 --> 03:02:41.400
I gotta put on my Patreon voice for this,

03:02:41.400 --> 03:02:44.400
because I can't believe that you,

03:02:44.400 --> 03:02:45.400
out of all people,

03:02:45.400 --> 03:02:48.400
wouldn't think that I am not the most elegant woman

03:02:49.400 --> 03:02:50.400
in all of the land.

03:02:54.400 --> 03:02:55.400
Bye-bye!

03:02:56.400 --> 03:02:57.400
Have a good night,

03:02:57.400 --> 03:02:58.400
or day, or evening,

03:02:58.400 --> 03:02:59.400
lunch or dinner or whatever.

03:03:00.400 --> 03:03:01.400
I got a pee.

03:03:03.400 --> 03:03:04.400
Motherly.

03:03:04.400 --> 03:03:05.400
Yeah, go do your homework.

03:03:06.400 --> 03:03:07.400
What are these grades?

03:03:07.400 --> 03:03:08.400
Get your GPA up, bro.

03:03:08.400 --> 03:03:09.400
You kidding me?

03:03:12.400 --> 03:03:13.400
Okay, for that voice too.

03:03:13.400 --> 03:03:14.400
Oh yeah!

03:03:14.400 --> 03:03:15.400
Shameless plan!

03:03:15.400 --> 03:03:16.400

03:03:21.400 --> 03:03:22.400

03:03:23.400 --> 03:03:24.400
I'm like, what the fuck do I have again?

03:03:24.400 --> 03:03:25.400
I don't know.

03:03:28.400 --> 03:03:29.400
Yep, checked it out.

03:03:32.400 --> 03:03:33.400
Hey!

03:03:33.400 --> 03:03:34.400
Imagine if it's done like that all the time,

03:03:34.400 --> 03:03:35.400
like, what's up guys?

03:03:35.400 --> 03:03:37.400
Hey, welcome to the stream.

03:03:37.400 --> 03:03:39.400
It's me, Sheena Gumball.

03:03:41.400 --> 03:03:44.400
New audios on Patreon every Thursday!

03:03:45.400 --> 03:03:47.400
Oh, is your GPA?

03:03:49.400 --> 03:03:50.400
Actually, in college,

03:03:50.400 --> 03:03:52.400
I had a perfect GPA,

03:03:52.400 --> 03:03:54.400
but then I dropped out to be a streamer.

03:03:55.400 --> 03:03:56.400
No, I didn't drop out to be a streamer.

03:03:56.400 --> 03:03:57.400
I was just like,

03:03:57.400 --> 03:03:58.400
between working full-time

03:03:58.400 --> 03:03:59.400
and just like streaming,

03:03:59.400 --> 03:04:00.400
which is what I wanted to do,

03:04:00.400 --> 03:04:02.400
I just, I,

03:04:02.400 --> 03:04:03.400
I was like, no,

03:04:03.400 --> 03:04:04.400
I don't feel like doing school.

03:04:04.400 --> 03:04:05.400
I can go to school anytime.

03:04:05.400 --> 03:04:07.400
I can finish school anytime

03:04:07.400 --> 03:04:08.400
at age of 56.

03:04:08.400 --> 03:04:09.400
I have plenty of time.

03:04:10.400 --> 03:04:12.400
Totally 56.

03:04:14.400 --> 03:04:15.400
But,

03:04:17.400 --> 03:04:18.400
what do you want to say?

03:04:19.400 --> 03:04:20.400
But in high school,

03:04:20.400 --> 03:04:21.400
I think it was like a 3.0

03:04:21.400 --> 03:04:22.400
because I didn't really care.

03:04:25.400 --> 03:04:26.400
Maybe he's been watching too much

03:04:26.400 --> 03:04:27.400
bimbofication.

03:04:27.400 --> 03:04:28.400
She could sell me a car and the boys.

03:04:28.400 --> 03:04:30.400
You can find so much shit in this thing.

03:04:30.400 --> 03:04:31.400
Like, in the back.

03:04:31.400 --> 03:04:33.400
Look how big and spacious.

03:04:33.400 --> 03:04:34.400
It's so spacious.

03:04:34.400 --> 03:04:36.400
I'm sketching my nose.

03:04:36.400 --> 03:04:38.400
It's so spacious in this back seat.

03:04:38.400 --> 03:04:39.400
You can do so many activities.

03:04:39.400 --> 03:04:41.400
Would you like to see some activities

03:04:41.400 --> 03:04:42.400
that you can do in the back seat?

03:04:42.400 --> 03:04:43.400
Yeah.

03:04:44.400 --> 03:04:45.720
Famasama, famasama,

03:04:45.720 --> 03:04:47.400

03:04:47.400 --> 03:04:48.400
I'm sorry.

03:04:48.400 --> 03:04:49.400

I don't know.

03:05:00.400 --> 03:05:01.400
I'm just talking like that.

03:05:01.400 --> 03:05:02.400
You know what I'm like?

03:05:02.400 --> 03:05:03.400

oh i definitely have like a gangly insist because of my fucked up joints i wish i could

03:18:48.280 --> 03:18:52.920
i've slammed a bible on it before and it exploded and it was great and then i

03:18:52.920 --> 03:18:57.560
didn't have wrist pain for a while i need to do it again because you have to like go and like have your hand

03:18:58.120 --> 03:19:09.800

i'm brown i can say it leave me alone um but hitting them with the word uh yes the word of the lord

03:19:42.680 --> 03:19:48.280
makes them go away um but lance uh not even lance you can't even lance you literally have to cut it

03:19:48.280 --> 03:19:57.080
out because what it is it's your joint fluid uh decides to go out of your bone or whatever the

03:19:57.080 --> 03:20:01.960
fuck your joints and then it makes a little pocket and sometimes you can pop it and your body

03:20:01.960 --> 03:20:09.480
will reabsorb it but you have to take out the sack so that it stops growing back um ten

03:20:13.080 --> 03:20:21.720

03:20:35.400 --> 03:20:39.560
but it was great because then it went down because i drew and um my mom was like why did you

03:20:39.560 --> 03:20:45.080

this week you don't even have to think of it of like oh go sir fucking talking to me it's just i like

03:27:52.200 --> 03:28:00.280
to put it like that that's how i frame it not like spirits from the other world they're speaking to me

03:28:00.280 --> 03:28:06.440
although i have done i did do uh the carot caro cards yes the carrot cards i have done like spell

can abort a baby with mugwort that was cool um i literally have all like my altars above my desk

03:28:23.400 --> 03:28:31.800
and all that shit but you know i don't expect people to like like that stuff you don't have to i just do

03:28:32.680 --> 03:28:36.760
as you can i don't talk about it on stream a lot because i don't make it a part of my

03:28:36.760 --> 03:28:42.040
personality but i will rub rose quartz on you because you need self-love homeboy i'm kidding

03:28:42.040 --> 03:28:47.800
it's fine tarot cards are just fun i have a few decks myself exactly yeah huh

03:28:50.280 --> 03:28:55.880
uh i have two tarot cards that's very accurate i've been told my readings are very accurate i used

03:28:55.880 --> 03:29:00.920
to do it for my previous viewers they loved it a lot uh they in fact scolded me when i because i

03:29:00.920 --> 03:29:04.840
usually you would do it every sunday the day of the lord and when i didn't do it on sunday they were mad

03:29:09.400 --> 03:29:14.280
i actually haven't done any of like like actually practice in a very long time like i'll leave out

03:29:14.280 --> 03:29:22.600
like an offering like and thanks and stuff um for like progress i've made um it's just like it's just

03:29:22.600 --> 03:29:28.440
like the equivalent of like okay you pray to your god or your ancestors or what have you

03:29:28.440 --> 03:29:35.240
you know everybody's entitled to their belief system i'm a cancer yeah to society i'm kidding

03:29:37.560 --> 03:29:46.120
kind of the moon stone so i can snort it baby girl um shibism yes exactly my dm uses tarot

03:29:46.120 --> 03:29:51.160
cards i've heard that people will sometimes use tarot and dnd games and i think that's very clever

03:29:52.360 --> 03:29:56.440
charger terry why are you guys randomly telling me your zodiac signs are you what do you want me

03:29:56.440 --> 03:30:01.640
to do with that information i don't i'm not like i don't like read your birth chart

03:30:03.800 --> 03:30:12.040
vergo over here okay everybody's just shouting out i'm a libra libras are very sensual did you know that

03:30:12.040 --> 03:30:26.680
torus gang oh you like money don't you little grubby money for um scorpio i'm such a scorpio girl

03:30:26.680 --> 03:30:29.720
it's funny because like half of you are probably lying so i'm like i'm not gonna

03:30:31.560 --> 03:30:38.840
find about tarot from cyberpunk oh yeah true i didn't think it's super through super well is that

03:30:38.840 --> 03:30:45.000
the sedutarius thing oh sedutarius is are very known to kind of be their fire sign so they're

03:30:45.000 --> 03:30:51.560
can be like impulsive and they prefer to like act just like aries actually um instead of like think

03:30:51.560 --> 03:30:59.720
they're also like boys on the move so my dad is an aries and my mom is a capricorn

03:30:59.720 --> 03:31:08.200
hard-working bitch my mom is lover for that yeah i got a ht that checks but like people

03:31:08.200 --> 03:31:13.880
are saying like oh i'm a sedutarius and then they won't identify with any traits of a sedutarius

03:31:13.880 --> 03:31:19.960
and that's because there are other things that have to do with your birth chart or whatever

03:31:19.960 --> 03:31:27.560
i don't read birth charts i don't have knowledge of that um but apparently you are more than just your

03:31:27.560 --> 03:31:33.000
your sun sign bergo is an honest sign i don't mind about it

03:31:35.320 --> 03:31:39.960
there also one of my one of my olive is a is overgo she's very ocd but she's not she

03:31:39.960 --> 03:31:43.480
doesn't have ocd but she's very like it has to be just like this

03:31:45.080 --> 03:31:51.800
Pisces don't be fishy uh the one pisces my my best friend growing up was a pisces

03:31:51.800 --> 03:31:56.760
they're very creative types she was she was an artist she loved to draw very much a dreamer

03:31:56.760 --> 03:31:58.440
as they are described

03:32:00.920 --> 03:32:06.440
yeah tracks for bergo i never lie about being a scorpio because that's the only one i know

03:32:06.440 --> 03:32:09.240
i know half the time i don't even remember all the zodiac signs i'm like uh

03:32:10.520 --> 03:32:12.040

03:34:58.280 --> 03:35:05.240
i like if you put like any two of us or three of us or four or five or all of us like we're all

03:35:45.800 --> 03:35:49.080
arctic phone was it was so funny oh my god it was so funny

03:35:49.080 --> 03:35:55.080
it was so funny oh my god it was so funny it was so funny oh yeah they're not i don't i don't see

03:35:55.080 --> 03:36:02.360
them as co-workers they're my sisters they're my sisters they are my sisters and strani is mommy

03:36:02.360 --> 03:36:07.080
honestly though it's funny because people like i've been asked by like other people from other

03:36:07.080 --> 03:36:13.160
corpos or like um my indie friends and they're like oh what's it like with your boss being your

03:36:13.160 --> 03:36:19.160
gen mate i'm like to be honest with you she doesn't really feel like my boss she's just my friend um

03:36:19.160 --> 03:36:26.520
and she kind of still falls under that sister category i don't really see her as a boss and

03:36:26.520 --> 03:36:31.160
that's what she wants but like obviously obviously i still respect her when she's like hey guys

03:36:31.160 --> 03:36:38.200
we need to work on this or do you mind uh doing this uh or like here's some critique for your

03:36:38.920 --> 03:36:44.920
or like here's some critique for your last audio like um i will respect and respond

03:36:44.920 --> 03:36:51.720
to her but i'll do that for everyone as well um but it's it's it's it's nice because like i don't

03:36:53.320 --> 03:37:00.280
feel like well that's not it sounds bad when i say it aloud like i don't feel like i have a boss

03:37:00.280 --> 03:37:06.760
but like i do obviously but it's like like it's just a nice work environment you know sisters

03:37:06.760 --> 03:37:13.880
benefits indeed your anime girl we're kind of like you not you guys i'm at the other i'm at the

03:37:13.880 --> 03:37:23.480
other my gen mates i don't care what you guys think you kidding me right meow i guess strani is more

03:37:23.480 --> 03:37:32.200
of a leader for lack of better terms but to be honest i would not we're all on pretty level

03:37:32.200 --> 03:37:35.640
ground because like strani will come to me and be like hey what do you think about this and i'm

03:37:35.640 --> 03:37:39.640
like oh he's my opinion and i'm like oh you should ask the other girls she's like you know what i will

03:37:39.640 --> 03:37:48.120
because like uh you guys forget strani has been a vtuber less for the majority of us so sometimes

03:37:48.120 --> 03:37:54.680
she'll ask us questions which is honestly and the thing like what a boss should do is like when they

03:37:54.680 --> 03:37:59.400
don't know something be able to talk to their staff and be like hey uh i need your help with this and

03:37:59.400 --> 03:38:04.760
she's asked me that um and i know she's probably done that for the other girls too like i know she's

03:38:04.760 --> 03:38:12.360
probably because emi has some rigging stuff so she's probably um we were having issues at one point

03:38:12.360 --> 03:38:18.840
but it was it wasn't at any fault of our rigor it was literally just um us not knowing how to set up

03:38:18.840 --> 03:38:27.400
stuff in vtuber studio properly um we were all struggling to like fix our mouth tracking uh for

03:38:27.400 --> 03:38:31.720
some reason because like the sensitivity was like low or whatever but it was just it was just like

03:38:31.800 --> 03:38:36.040
vtuber studio being stupid and emi was like oh this this is that and then strani was like yay

03:38:38.280 --> 03:38:43.880
so um but yeah these aren't supposed to be all no yeah like leader a leader is someone who knows

03:38:43.880 --> 03:38:50.760
when to ask for help um knows what everybody's strengths and weaknesses are and make sure everybody

03:38:50.760 --> 03:38:57.320
is supported um but yeah actually then yes strani is a great leader 100 but she doesn't

03:38:57.320 --> 03:39:02.120
she's not like i'm what i'm what i mean to say she doesn't come off like i am a top

03:39:02.120 --> 03:39:08.200
sorry i'm the top bitch in this this corpo i can't i can't even do with a the accent

03:39:08.200 --> 03:39:10.760
but i need a toot

03:39:21.080 --> 03:39:27.000
um upwards management collaboration yeah it's just it's just collaboration

03:39:27.960 --> 03:39:30.760
guys don't deserve the two you got one free two you don't get anymore

03:39:31.080 --> 03:39:39.480
listen first and act second yeah exactly because like strani's been on me she's like oh you

03:39:39.480 --> 03:39:46.040
know what should we work on for july and i'm like um i don't know you tell me

03:39:47.880 --> 03:39:51.880
but she's but she's like she asked for feedback and she's so receptive because she wants to make

03:39:51.880 --> 03:39:59.720
sure everybody's doing okay he's very good he's not mean about anything um i appreciate her a lot

03:39:59.720 --> 03:40:03.800
because i like i'm that's why i'm like i don't think i could see myself another company if they

03:40:03.800 --> 03:40:10.200
didn't treat me like this like if if like five years from now i'm still a vtuber but violer has

03:40:10.200 --> 03:40:15.960
ceased operations god forbid and i get picked up by another corpo if they ain't like strani then

03:40:15.960 --> 03:40:24.040
i don't want it i wait the day she be masters of strani impersonation that would be terrifying

03:40:25.000 --> 03:40:29.400
uh if only i could be like elizabeth row's blood flame and just literally mimic

03:40:29.400 --> 03:40:33.000
people's voices perfectly oh i wish i had that superpower

03:40:36.520 --> 03:40:45.000
yeah i definitely won't find a corpo like this um but like i in terms of management yes we're

03:40:45.000 --> 03:40:49.960
different in terms of like transparency with like our split and stuff yes we're different

03:40:49.960 --> 03:40:57.000
but honestly from like we're not different from other corpos that much minus the patreon

03:40:57.000 --> 03:41:02.760
audios i'll be honest with you like yeah but if you're elizabeth you'll be british

03:41:04.200 --> 03:41:11.480
i like british accents but i see the i see the quandary there yeah her her kiara impression

03:41:11.480 --> 03:41:15.400
and her mori impression were really good but speaking of why do people think do people really

03:41:15.400 --> 03:41:23.880
think i sound like mori like i don't i don't think i sound like mori but that's that's very good uh

03:41:23.880 --> 03:41:28.280
that's a very good honor collab with mori rap rapping with mori just kidding hollow live fans would

03:41:28.280 --> 03:41:35.160
actually murder me they're like whore kill her burn her at the stake i don't think you do oh i think

03:41:35.160 --> 03:41:40.440
maybe it was in my debut because some people uh said that i sound like mori and like left comments

03:41:40.440 --> 03:41:47.480
about it moro vibe i got a more i got the mori vibe the mori calliope vibe that's an honor thank you

03:41:48.440 --> 03:41:52.440
i think it's a transparency that gives perception of you are being vividly wildly different yeah

03:41:52.440 --> 03:42:01.480
you know like a lot of people um still like shit honest and stuff because apparently um so people

03:42:03.000 --> 03:42:09.720
it was brought to my attention by one of my gen mates that my me quitting my job had made its

03:42:09.720 --> 03:42:15.400
way to reddit and reddit people were not happy that i quit my job to be a vtuber that she's like

03:42:15.400 --> 03:42:22.760
she's never gonna make it asmr is going down the drain blah blah blah blah and i i shout out to the

03:42:22.760 --> 03:42:27.960
like two people in the fed we're like she was already planning on doing this she's getting a

03:42:27.960 --> 03:42:33.320
different part-time job and her other job is scoring her over there's more to this than just

03:42:33.320 --> 03:42:41.080
she's quitting her job wait for real yeah oh yeah yeah but i was just like

03:42:43.080 --> 03:42:51.160
i realized in like normal like normie places like a lot of people really think that we're

03:42:51.960 --> 03:42:56.840
gonna be like so shitty or like we're gonna be doing terrible things in our streams and just

03:42:56.840 --> 03:43:01.400
makes me laugh so hard because we are the most normal people like yes i'll make some like off-color

03:43:01.400 --> 03:43:06.520
jokes and i'll make like make some like preferred jokes but you'll see there's some vtubers that get

03:43:06.520 --> 03:43:16.040
away with way more than i do like to be honest even the garthik phone stream 100 i bet like if if we

03:43:16.040 --> 03:43:25.880
wanted to we could definitely like tamper ourselves a little bit to be like another corpo like like

03:43:25.880 --> 03:43:33.080
like look at idle like we're we're just similar except not cony we see the quiet part out loud that's

03:43:33.080 --> 03:43:39.480
literally what i say i'm like we just actually advertise our stuff we're also yeah we have a

03:43:39.480 --> 03:43:44.680
relay back i agree mrs boris don't put by much contact yeah that's true

03:43:48.280 --> 03:43:52.200
low key when i go back to school and i graduate want to do what you did and quit my job and

03:43:52.200 --> 03:43:59.000
fucking ball that's fucking ball um good luck with that bro i i really hope that works out for

03:43:59.000 --> 03:44:05.960
you quitting your jobs hard like um i have been looking uh the job stuff sucks like i said i had

03:44:05.960 --> 03:44:16.040
savings but hopefully hopefully you know um hopefully that i can just live off a dealer

03:44:16.040 --> 03:44:22.520
we'll see because again that's up up to you guys and i don't want to pressure you to be like

03:44:23.160 --> 03:44:26.600
i need to live give me your money that you need to live

03:44:29.160 --> 03:44:32.680
well like just like you're all yourselves yeah exactly and then you know sometimes we'll

03:44:32.680 --> 03:44:37.720
lean into our cafe and like do the fantasy that everybody wants but you know i'm just chilling

03:44:37.720 --> 03:44:43.080
i'm just hanging out you know i'm just here i'm just having a good time yeah i don't need food

03:44:43.880 --> 03:44:52.680

03:44:52.680 --> 03:44:58.920

03:44:58.920 --> 03:45:07.960
they're very very um like i kind of like looking at everybody's fan bases and like like i'll creep

03:45:07.960 --> 03:45:11.960
on everybody's fan bases and be like oh what's what people say

03:45:14.040 --> 03:45:18.040

stop it um thank you for the for the 420 blaze it

03:45:29.160 --> 03:45:37.000
um but yes so like like i i walked back my thing about being like i don't like people

03:45:37.000 --> 03:45:40.440
watching other people or oh she marks because i'm just like you know i'm trying to make a

03:45:40.440 --> 03:45:47.000
connection i'm trying to network and all that stuff um uh and so i'll creep on you guys and i'm like

03:45:47.000 --> 03:45:54.680
oh you guys are sweet oh you guys are nice um i especially like there's a certain type of love

03:45:54.680 --> 03:45:59.960
and affection that everybody's fan base has for them for their respective talents and it just

03:45:59.960 --> 03:46:04.120
generally makes me so happy to see you know there's always like a couple of ones that are like

03:46:04.760 --> 03:46:11.400
when's your period did you wake up but like that's that's that's in every every fan base

03:46:13.000 --> 03:46:14.520
um i am always watching

03:46:21.720 --> 03:46:27.240
and my my fan base i realize i think they control themselves they're like they hold back

03:46:27.480 --> 03:46:35.320
and i think that's sweet i feel like they're i feel like thank you black silence

03:46:39.480 --> 03:46:43.880
i heard money superserved thank you

03:46:48.760 --> 03:46:52.920
oh yeah no again i recognize a lot of people and i'll i'll creep on you a different stream

03:46:53.000 --> 03:47:00.520
oh my god anonymous tip six dollars and ninety cents what's the cut out only heard give me money

03:47:00.520 --> 03:47:12.600
okay yeah people are gonna think i'm a fandom um thank you anonymous for that tip uh yeah i hold

03:47:12.600 --> 03:47:19.400
back yeah it's it's it's so interesting how the dynamics um and i'm like maybe it's because like

03:47:19.400 --> 03:47:27.240
i'm a little reserved as well like i don't maybe i don't do as much um and also just how my how i am

03:47:27.240 --> 03:47:28.280
i'm i'm very

03:47:34.200 --> 03:47:40.360
there's a lot of trust that has to be built you know um so i know like i'm slowly opening up

03:47:40.360 --> 03:47:47.960
like yes i've done like fun things now and then on my all but like i haven't shown my true power level

03:47:50.360 --> 03:47:59.480
um but ew brother ew fandom ew um fans reflect the streamer so i'm like okay i fans reflect the streamer

03:48:00.760 --> 03:48:06.440
is it because i'm reserved but i what i was gonna say i'm like i feel like i'm like the girl at school

03:48:07.320 --> 03:48:10.840
that you think is really pretty and cute and you just don't know how to talk to her

03:48:12.200 --> 03:48:17.160
and you're like i want you to step on me i just i really want to tell her that

03:48:17.240 --> 03:48:24.760
anonymous tipped four dollars and 20 cents so i heard supers and tips are free oh my god thank you

03:48:28.520 --> 03:48:33.960
um yeah it's only been three weeks it's crazy and yeah and it's like we'll grow like i i'm probably

03:48:33.960 --> 03:48:38.440
going to be you know a different streamer in the future because i'm going to be learning more things

03:48:38.440 --> 03:48:45.320
i'm gonna kind of become uncomfortable with each other um but not even just like i i know i don't

03:48:45.320 --> 03:48:52.360
have as have as much as a ravenous fan base or rabid fan base as uh some of the other girls

03:48:53.000 --> 03:48:58.040
um and honestly like that's okay because i think we're all unique we all attract a different

03:48:58.920 --> 03:49:08.040
group of people i love the sweet devotion of reeflings i love the absolute care that dadas have for

03:49:08.040 --> 03:49:15.400
i see i love the worshiping aura that bleeding hearts that the blacks have the black bros have

03:49:15.400 --> 03:49:29.400
for for azura i love the respectful admiration of senpai's um i appreciate the insanity that our pen pals

03:49:29.960 --> 03:49:41.080
um and then you know i love my harem i don't love you no i didn't say that shut up uh i appreciate

03:49:41.080 --> 03:49:54.280
my hair um and it's funny because i also i will admit i vote it's i love my daughter wife i see

03:49:54.280 --> 03:50:05.400
you uh i will admit because of the character i play i do hold back and i've been told um by someone

03:50:06.360 --> 03:50:16.920
that uh i hold back i'm a freak baby i'm a freak um but it's also like a lot of the things uh

03:50:17.480 --> 03:50:25.240
uh that i would go off about don't really apply to this persona like it kind of made more sense when i

03:50:25.240 --> 03:50:34.920
was rena she was cute and funny but for being dominant and in control uh but even then like

03:50:34.920 --> 03:50:40.680
there's some things i'm just like no i can't say that i can't i don't i can't i can't uh

03:50:41.560 --> 03:50:48.440
uh encourage that type of behavior because i have to be responsible i'm responsible

03:50:48.440 --> 03:50:55.640
for the sometimes i'm just like go crazy go stupid uh wait you aren't here but hold on

03:50:55.640 --> 03:50:57.640
um

03:51:07.080 --> 03:51:11.560
just kidding bitch um that big mama um anyway

03:51:15.320 --> 03:51:18.440
reserved for the cute and funny 2.0 maybe

03:51:18.440 --> 03:51:25.160
i don't know just holding back a lot of you guys were very surprised by the present that i got you

03:51:27.000 --> 03:51:30.360
you thought i want to treat you that's uh that's the reason why i didn't put it on

03:51:30.360 --> 03:51:32.840
my throne is that like i'm going to buy this for them

03:51:35.640 --> 03:51:41.400
he scratches all the itches what's the cage what are you talking about that's that's what i do pilates with

really

03:55:56.040 --> 03:55:59.640
okay i'm calling it that from now on you guys better be reading your bible i hope you're reading

03:55:59.640 --> 03:56:06.440
your bible i hope uh whatever hand you like to turn the pages with i hope you're reading your

03:56:06.440 --> 03:56:14.440
bible really study your verses i want you to really focus on that scripture that you're reading

03:56:14.440 --> 03:56:22.840
right now the very top of the scripture that i want you to slowly read the scripture down

03:56:26.120 --> 03:56:30.040
and then i want you to repeat the process for other scriptures linger

03:56:31.000 --> 03:56:34.600
at the beginning of the words in the scripture and then slowly

03:56:35.640 --> 03:56:43.640
read the final words really meditate on the word okay you love bible study oh i love bible study i

03:56:43.640 --> 03:56:45.800
bible study i did up my bible study before

03:56:51.400 --> 03:56:52.040
what was that

03:56:55.800 --> 03:57:04.600
jesus took the strap verses we know i don't um yeah i was reading i was watching

03:57:05.640 --> 03:57:09.640
it's really meditating on scripture it took longer for me to finish the passage than i

03:57:10.440 --> 03:57:13.720
anticipated none outfit when

03:57:15.640 --> 03:57:17.480
goth none hi reina

03:57:20.440 --> 03:57:21.400
i burp on you reina

03:57:25.640 --> 03:57:29.160
why is your chest wet were you just drinking water and just stuck your body in it

03:57:33.560 --> 03:57:38.280
five minute bible study yeah usually it's i do a quick bible study um but that one was like a

03:57:38.280 --> 03:57:45.400
20 minute bible study i don't it was really hard my favorite verse um

03:57:48.760 --> 03:57:55.160
if your eye is harming you tear it from your head and cast it away

03:57:59.400 --> 03:58:04.600
and if you have a rafter in your own eye do not point out the rafter in your brother's

03:58:05.400 --> 03:58:07.640
for you must remove your own raptor yourself

03:58:14.520 --> 03:58:16.760
yeah and that's actual scripture um by the way

03:58:19.560 --> 03:58:22.520
and the name of the bible writer of the holy spirit amen

03:58:23.960 --> 03:58:26.520
ah yes luke 623 is that luke 623

03:58:28.440 --> 03:58:32.840
proverb maybe i think it is a proverb i can't remember remember the bible it was so long

03:58:33.560 --> 03:58:38.360
you got something in your eye what the what it means i don't get my eye till i

03:58:39.240 --> 03:58:44.360
what it means is you can't point out bad shit the other people have done when you have done

03:58:44.360 --> 03:58:48.200
your own bad shit you got to work on yourself before you could be like oh you did this shit

03:58:50.040 --> 03:58:54.920
i think reina did she tear up the eyes of your no no no it wasn't tear the eye of your enemy

03:58:55.480 --> 03:59:01.080
well again there's different translations because you have like the king's james translation you have like

03:59:03.800 --> 03:59:05.800
i can only think of the king's james one right now

03:59:10.120 --> 03:59:16.440
but yes uh very much i hope you're meditating on your scripture um i should put a non-outfit on throne

03:59:19.880 --> 03:59:27.000
people ask like oh how do i count oh no my question is how do i how am i supposed to count

03:59:28.120 --> 03:59:31.720
down through certain scriptures like that's what i'm wondering about

03:59:33.800 --> 03:59:40.920
how do i do that like oh okay first verse second verse third verse

03:59:41.560 --> 03:59:46.600
be a fan of the older new testament i'm an old testament i like uh i like old testament god

03:59:46.600 --> 03:59:50.440
because he was just like a dick and wanted to kill everybody you know my favorite conspiracy

03:59:50.440 --> 03:59:55.400
theory about the bible is that they're two separate gods because the old testament god and the new

03:59:55.400 --> 04:00:01.720
testament god are very very different in how they act towards humans all testament gods like i'm

04:00:01.720 --> 04:00:07.000
gonna smite everyone and the new testament god's like oh i love you all oh you're so sweet here's my

04:00:07.000 --> 04:00:15.240
son i'm sending my son he's gonna die for your son uh i just like how badass old testament god was

04:00:15.240 --> 04:00:18.760
although book of revelation is trippy as hell i'll tell you that much

04:00:21.720 --> 04:00:26.520
let's say start at 10 first 10 and go backwards oh i like that i like that

04:00:27.240 --> 04:00:38.040
i want you to read luke chapter six verse 10 and then i want you to read

04:00:40.360 --> 04:00:43.640
luke chapter six verse nine

04:00:46.760 --> 04:00:50.360
and then i really want you to think about eight

04:00:56.840 --> 04:01:02.760
are you thinking hard about eight

04:01:05.560 --> 04:01:10.520
uh we'll finish the other chapter the other verse is another day though you know

04:01:13.240 --> 04:01:14.680
