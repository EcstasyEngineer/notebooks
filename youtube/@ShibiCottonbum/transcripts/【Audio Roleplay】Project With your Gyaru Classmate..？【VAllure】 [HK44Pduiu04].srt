1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You

3
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You

4
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You

5
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You

6
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You

7
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm talking now my voice is too low. If I could really close, yes.

8
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I've worked on this for several hours and if it's still not working, then I'm gonna cry.

9
00:04:46,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's not working. I'm using you.

10
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm really gonna cry.

11
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It's still too quiet.

12
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I don't know.

13
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Does that work?

14
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Hello?

15
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Oh, my cheek is still white.

16
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Can you hear me?

17
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Okay, I'm really sad.

18
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Nothing's working today and I'm kind of upset.

19
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:22,000
The one thing that was bothering me is that I couldn't change one of my eyelashes to the right color because the mesh is just not working.

20
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I apologize if you can hear my AC.

21
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'll put on some rain.

22
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I hope the rain helps.

23
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I didn't want to cancel though because I wanted to spend time with you today.

24
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I have allergies. That's why I'm sniffling by the way.

25
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:44,000
My head would stay connected to my body.

26
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Do you think I look cute?

27
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Do I look nice?

28
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I also think there's a delay.

29
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Again, I don't know why.

30
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
She needs reassurance. She's been stressed out today.

31
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm working with stuff and I'm tired of technology.

32
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm moving the model with my mouth so I'm not all the way over here.

33
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Hi, my name is Sheeby Cottonbomb and today we're going to be doing an ASMR.

34
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It's going to be Improv ASMR.

35
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm kind of mad that my stream is not doing the right latency because Improv is needed and chat interaction is needed.

36
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Sorry if I sniffle in your ear.

37
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I should change the title to You Give Yaro Sheeby Therapy because she's stressed out.

38
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
What do you mean I'm just ahead?

39
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

40
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,000
My allergies are kidding me this morning.

41
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I don't feel good.

42
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm having a pain flare up so I don't really feel good right now either.

43
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I won't get my white cheek.

44
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Let me fix that.

45
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
This might be very scuffed ASMR. I apologize.

46
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm still pissed. I can't color my one eyelash.

47
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Did I?

48
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I should have posted on the wrong account.

49
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Oh my god, I'm going to lose a guy this way.

50
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Yeah, it's one of those things.

56
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I'll probably just cut all of this out of the vod.

57
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:26,000
What was I going to do? I was going to color my cheek.

58
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I can't do that right now. It doesn't matter.

59
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
No, it doesn't matter to me.

60
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm very...

61
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Don't worry about how my head is disconnected.

62
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I'm very...

63
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I don't really know how to explain that I'm not myself today.

64
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:00,000
But I'm not myself today, as you can see.

65
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I'm almost wishing I could be babyed right now.

66
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Hold on.

67
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Now you throw my head in the trash.

68
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Anyways, how's it going?

69
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
One moment.

70
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I will remind you that my Bunspeak accent comes out when I'm...

71
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
feeling some types of way.

72
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
But don't worry.

73
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It'll change.

74
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Is there a voice in the background?

75
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It's my desktop audio.

76
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Do you like my bedroom? I took it from Canvo.

77
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:36,000
No.

78
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Nobody can see that, right?

79
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Maybe I should not do this on stream.

80
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Don't look.

81
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Don't look.

82
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Don't worry about it.

83
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
That's close enough.

84
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Ahem.

85
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I love that.

86
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I look very cute. I can't wait to get hands.

87
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'm stressing.

88
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Okay, yeah.

89
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Yaru Dolhan gets babyed by chat, maybe.

90
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Okay, um, how long?

91
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Okay, I've been streaming for 16 minutes.

92
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I won't cut 16 minutes.

93
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
So the roleplay today is going to be improved.

94
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It's going to be more scuffed than you think it is, because I'm kind of doing stuff off the rip.

95
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I'm going to do all the doughnose and stuff at the end and all that.

96
00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Yeah.

97
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
What if I told you, like, you want this color?

98
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Not good, because I'm going to be this color eventually.

99
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Um, so this is going to require some chat interaction.

100
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Are you ready to rumble?

101
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I have some stuff.

102
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I'm used to this scuff, madam. It's fine.

103
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Why am I holding your hair?

104
00:17:50,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Hmm.

105
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
What was that about?

106
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,000
You're sleepy already?

107
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:18,000
The scene is, you're my classmate.

108
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Why did you over my house?

109
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Why did you over my house?

110
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Because we can work on a project together.

111
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,000
My body's going to be jumping back and forth.

112
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It's a rainy day.

113
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,000
And you don't have any power at your house.

114
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
So we're doing that at mine. I hope you don't mind.

115
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Is that okay with you?

116
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,000
It better be okay with you. You don't really have a choice in this.

117
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:30,000
This is my bedroom.

118
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I'm going to...

119
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I'm going to put my body on the bed and you can stare at her from over there.

120
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:04,000
This is mine.

121
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Pink is my favorite color.

122
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I'm going to start now.

123
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Hey, yeah. You can put yourself anywhere. Make yourself at home.

124
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I guess we better get ready and get started on that project.

125
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Did you remember to bring the assignment?

126
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
No.

127
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Do you even remember what the assignment is?

128
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
You don't?

129
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I knew I shouldn't have partnered with you.

130
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I was hoping that you'd do all the work because I thought you were one of the smarter kids.

131
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I guess I was wrong. I guess you're just still dumb.

132
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
What's that on my bed?

133
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Oh, it's just my body.

134
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Don't worry about that.

135
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Sorry if my AC's loud. It has been a pretty hot one out there.

136
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Please don't stare at her though. That's kind of rude. Please don't stare at my body.

137
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,000
She's, you know, just trying to hang out.

138
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
You fell asleep in class when the teacher was telling us?

139
00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I would never have ever thought that from you. Have you been getting sleep?

140
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Alright. Maybe you should work on getting better sleep.

141
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Well, so, we have a history project.

142
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:32,000
It has to do with 18th century literature and its impact on history.

143
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I think. Hold on. Let me go on my phone real quick. I'll tell you what the teacher emailed me.

144
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Hold on.

145
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
No.

146
00:22:50,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Oh my god, where's this freaking email?

147
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:08,000
My phone turned into a book.

148
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Oh, it's the history of magic. That's what it is. That's why I managed to turn my phone into a book.

149
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:30,000
My body's holding the phone. I have two phones.

150
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:38,000
You only know about 17th century literature? You're going to be absolutely useless.

151
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Can we look at the history of anthropomorphic girls? I think that's a little bit off topic.

152
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Anyways, you can come and sit with me on the bed and we can start.

153
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Did you bring your notebook with you for class?

154
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:08,000
You did? Okay. Cool.

155
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Hold on. Let me just tuck my head on my body.

156
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Give me a moment.

157
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Hold on. My head's still a little bit too big.

158
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Him.

159
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Why don't you come sit?

160
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Just make yourself comfortable. Just come sit down.

161
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Is there a problem?

162
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Yeah, you can sit on my butt. Where else are you going to sit? That chair?

163
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I guess you could sit there too if you wanted to, but it will be easier if you sit nice and close to me.

164
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Let me grab my notebook.

165
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Okay, I got it.

166
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Alright, so do you mind if I copy some of your notes?

167
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Can you lay on my lap? Well, that's a little bit too close for comfort.

168
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Yeah, and you're either close to me so I can read your notes and copy some of them.

169
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Okay? Thank you.

170
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Alright, so you said that you would do this.

171
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
You would do that.

172
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,000
What does that say? What does that say? I can't really read your writing.

173
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
What is it? I'll come back to that later, I guess.

174
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Okay.

175
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,000
And then you're right there.

176
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Okay, what if I...

177
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I'm not coincidentally wrong.

178
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
You put...

179
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:54,000
You regard an eye.

180
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
That's alright. My handwriting is best you do.

181
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I'm getting bored reading all your stupid words anyways.

182
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I thought you were supposed to be the smart one. I think my notes are better than yours.

183
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I don't know if I should even bother copying these.

184
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Yeah, you still spoke coincidentally incorrect.

185
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Can you spell supercalifragilisticexpialidocious?

186
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Thank you.

187
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
X-P-M-Dosh.

188
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:52,000
S-U-P-E-R-C-A-L-I-F-R-A-G.

189
00:27:52,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I-L-I-S-T-I-C-E-X-P-I-A-L-A-D-O-C-I-O-U-S.

190
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.

191
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I'm sorry. That was correct.

192
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Oh, you can spell it, right? You still hope.

193
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Unless you're just typing what I just told you.

194
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Even the sound of it is something quite atrocious.

195
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Did you ever watch Mary Poppins?

196
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I don't know.

197
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Yeah, it's a real word.

198
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Look it up. Wake up supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.

199
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
And then your mouth.

200
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I'm going to pop my head on then.

201
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I'm sorry.

202
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I'm sorry.

203
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I'm married Poppins, you know.

204
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I think that we're even getting a little louder.

205
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I hope you don't mind. You can still hear me, right?

206
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Do you have another page I can copy?

207
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Cool.

208
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:03,000
It's pretty humid outside.

209
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I think I need a sharpener in my pencil, but I don't have a pencil sharpener.

210
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Do you have a pencil I can borrow?

211
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Did I hear about the drama between Stacy and her mom?

212
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I heard that Stacy's mom has got it going on.

213
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
That's all I've heard though.

214
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I don't know what you've heard.

215
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Can we chew on your pencils?

216
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I love chewing on pencils.

217
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Pencil chewing.

218
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:02,000
It's quite tasty to be honest.

219
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I don't like chewing on an eraser.

220
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Thank you for letting me borrow your pencil that you want.

221
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Have you ever seen Stacy's mom?

222
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I haven't seen her.

223
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Is she hot?

224
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
What does that word say?

225
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I said what does that word say?

226
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
That one right there.

227
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Can you tell me what that word says?

228
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
It says what?

229
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:41,000
You can't write that.

230
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Why would you write that?

231
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,000
That wasn't part of the lesson.

232
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I gotta sneeze.

233
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Okay.

234
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I don't think you're listening to me.

235
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
What does that say?

236
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
You don't know what it says?

237
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Are you blind?

238
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I think you're blind.

239
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
What's up with that?

240
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I don't know.

241
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
It says something in the...

242
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
You're writing inappropriate things.

243
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Is this not...

244
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Are you writing inappropriate things?

245
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I don't...

246
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I'm just gonna skip that section

247
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
because I don't know what you were writing.

248
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
You're really weird.

249
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
You're like really really weird.

250
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I wish we weren't lab partners.

251
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
It says street class but we're lab partners.

252
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Don't question it.

253
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
We're partners in a lot of things.

254
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
What's up with that?

255
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Why are you so...

256
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
You do need your glasses?

257
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Then grab your glasses.

258
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
That says bloodonkers.

259
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Why would you write bloodonkers?

260
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Why are you so naughty?

261
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:09,000
That's really inappropriate.

262
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
What does that say?

263
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Can you repeat...

264
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Can you say this what you wrote out loud?

265
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Because I need to hear you say it.

266
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
It's a history line, exactly.

267
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
We're always partners.

268
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
We're partners in biology.

269
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
We're partners in anatomy.

270
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
We're partners together in history class.

271
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
I'm kind of sick of seeing you in my face.

272
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I didn't even want to light you over my house.

273
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
My mom said I had to light you over my house.

274
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I didn't even want to light you over my house.

275
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Because you're one of the kids and you're small weird.

276
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
You're one of the weird kids that sits alone.

277
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
And don't you like a minet or something?

278
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
What is it called?

279
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Like cartoons?

280
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Are you like a little too old for cartoons?

281
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Peanuts?

282
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
What is peanuts?

283
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I don't know what that means.

284
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I don't...

285
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:22,000
What's going on here?

286
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
What's up with that?

287
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Anime?

288
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Whatever the fuck that is, I don't really care about it.

289
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Why do you like anime?

290
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Anime is weird.

291
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Anime is for weirdos.

292
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Your mom likes me though?

293
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,000
No, she doesn't.

294
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Wait, now I have to ask her.

295
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I'm weird sometimes.

296
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
What's this anime called?

297
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
You have a manga?

298
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
A manga?

299
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
A manga?

300
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
A manga?

301
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
What is...

302
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
You have a comic book in your backpack?

303
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
What does it say?

304
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Is it in Japanese?

305
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I can't read Japanese.

306
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
It's not in Japanese?

307
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Oh, the cover is in Japanese.

308
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Oh, I got those nipples.

309
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Why do you have to read this from right to left?

310
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
That's really confusing.

311
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
A mango?

312
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I wish I had a mango.

313
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Your mom likes me, and if you keep being unpolite, I'm going to hit her.

314
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Don't hit on my mom.

315
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
That's weird.

316
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
You're weirdo.

317
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:01,000
You like anime and you want to hit on people's moms?

318
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
What's...

319
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
It's called a dojinshi?

320
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
What is that?

321
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Can I see it?

322
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Give it to me.

323
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Over.

324
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Just let me see it.

325
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Why are you fighting me?

326
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Why would you bring it out of your backpack if you weren't going to show it to me?

327
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Don't run away from me.

328
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Hand it over.

329
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Thank you very much.

330
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Let me look through it.

331
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I can't even see what this is saying.

332
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Oh, mom.

333
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Okay.

334
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:02,000
What the heck is this?

335
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:08,000
What are you reading?

336
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
What?

337
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Did you just call me a baka?

338
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
What the heck is a baka?

339
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Why are you looking at this stuff at school?

340
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Wait, where did you get it?

341
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
How did you get this?

342
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Did they help us in the school library?

343
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Do you have more of this?

344
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Is this kind of hot?

345
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Is this kind of cool?

346
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I can't tell what's going on.

347
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Why can't I see through her?

348
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,000
That's a lot of liquid.

349
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
What is that?

350
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Is that supposed to be what I think it's supposed to be?

351
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
It's a gyaru dosi?

352
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
What's a gyaru?

353
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
What's a gyaru?

354
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Gyaru?

355
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I don't know what that is.

356
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
My name is Shibi, right?

357
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Yeah?

358
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
That's what my mom named me.

359
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,000
After the Queen of Shiba, African Princess.

360
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I guess this is kind of cool.

361
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
It's kind of weird that you read this at school, though.

362
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Do you, like, do anything about it?

363
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I'm not so sure about this.

364
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
This is some graphic stuff.

365
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Is it Japanese fashion trend?

366
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Can you show me a picture on your phone?

367
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
I can't really tell what's going on in this picture.

368
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,000
It's like she's up high.

369
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Her legs are kind of all over the place.

370
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
When you're bored at school, what do you do?

371
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I don't think you do this.

372
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I don't think you do that.

373
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I don't think anybody does that.

374
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Why would you do that?

375
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
You'd rather not say?

376
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Why are you being shy with me?

377
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Why did you take this out of your backpack then?

378
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Huh? Tell me.

379
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Why do you have this?

380
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Where did you get this?

381
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
It's kind of weird that you have this.

382
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
The art's nice or whatever.

383
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:58,000
But, like, I don't...

384
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I'm not sure about this one.

385
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
This is kind of weird.

386
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
You don't read it at school.

387
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
You're holding it for a friend.

388
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,000
You know, you do hang out with weird people.

389
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
And you do kind of smell bad.

390
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Like...

391
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Why do you smell so bad?

392
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Yeah, my nose is stuffy, but I can still tell

393
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:32,000
that you smell so bad.

394
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
My God.

395
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Do you, like, ever shower?

396
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Like, didn't we have, like, gym class today?

397
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
When was the last time you showered?

398
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I need to blow my nose.

399
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Because I need to blow off this stinky...

400
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Your shower is broken.

401
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I guess you can, you know...

402
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
You can shower in my house if you want.

403
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
I'm sure my...

404
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I have...

405
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
My older brother came, like...

406
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Like, he borrowed someone's clothes.

407
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I don't know if they'll fit you, though.

408
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Maybe you can fit into my sister's clothes.

409
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
So if you decide to take a shower,

410
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
you can dress up in my sister's clothes.

411
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Or, you know, you're kind of small.

412
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Maybe you can fit my clothes.

413
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I better have a t-shirt for you.

414
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Yeah, I...

415
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
You're gonna...

416
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:38,000
You're gonna need that shower, I think.

417
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Because, like...

418
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Yeah, my sister.

419
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Oh, my brother.

420
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
My sister, if it were that...

421
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
She doesn't have to know.

422
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
We have to tell her.

423
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I read her panties all the time.

424
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Don't tell her I said that.

425
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Hmm...

426
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Is my sister single?

427
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Well, she's 14, so you tell me.

428
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I just think we'd fit her clothes,

429
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:28,000
because you guys are, like, the same size.

430
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I think I gotta sneeze again.

431
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Ah!

432
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:48,000
She has cute clothes, and I like to take them.

433
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I'm kidding.

434
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
She's my age.

435
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
And we're both in school.

436
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
We're literally in the same grade.

437
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
She's my twin sister.

438
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
You've seen her before.

439
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Shibani?

440
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
You've seen Shibani?

441
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
That's my sister.

442
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
I'm Shibani.

443
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:12,000
And my sister is Shibani.

444
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
We have very different tastes.

445
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
My brother right now thinks he's, like, a London drill rapper.

446
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:28,000
He might be able to hear him in the next room.

447
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Yeah, he's kind of weird.

448
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Yeah, Shibani is darkness.

449
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
She calls herself that.

450
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Her real name is really just, um...

451
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Shibritney, but if she don't tell her, I told you that.

452
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
She hates her name.

453
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I'm Shibethani.

454
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
She's technically Shibritney,

455
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
but she likes to be called Shibani.

456
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Shibani.

457
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I'm a really big family.

458
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I need a sneeze.

459
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
That?

460
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Phew!

461
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I don't know my panic.

462
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
I'm not a strong sneeze.

463
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
I mean, don't worry about it.

464
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Um, does she call me a prep?

465
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Yeah, she does.

466
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
I don't know why she does that.

467
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
I don't know.

468
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Does your brother have a sister complex?

469
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,000
I don't know what that means.

470
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Does he have a stroke?

471
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Should we call an ambulance?

472
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Yeah, you know, we did that before,

473
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
but he just got mad at us.

474
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,000
So, it is what it is.

475
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Thank you.

476
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Um, I guess since I'm done copying your notes and stuff

477
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
and you showed me that weird book,

478
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
I'm just going to hop on the computer

479
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
and I'm going to, you know,

480
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
I'm just going to do some re...

481
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I left my body behind.

482
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Um, I'm just going to do some research.

483
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Let me sit better in this chair.

484
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:35,000
My body is stuck.

485
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
There we go.

486
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:43,000
I was kind of, like, up in the air.

487
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Okay, um, I'm not doing research on a weird thing.

488
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
On a weird book.

489
00:45:52,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I'm just going to do some typing.

490
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:09,000
I need to set my keyboard up.

491
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Don't worry when I'm looking up,

492
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:25,000
it's none of your business, okay?

493
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:30,000
You just say you think I look cute?

494
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
That's kind of weird for you to say.

495
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:43,000
We're just, we're just studying together.

496
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Thanks, I guess.

497
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:52,000
You weirdo.

498
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Whatever.

499
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Anyways, I'm going to keep looking up the research.

500
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Oh, there's a lot of these.

501
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,000
This doesn't really have to do with our project,

502
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:26,000
but it's very interesting.

503
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:37,000
How did you get into this dojinsha?

504
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Anything about that?

505
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Hey, my head's kind of staying on.

506
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Nope, I'm slowly drifting away.

507
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:57,000
I don't know how that works.

508
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Hmm.

509
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Interesting.

510
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:18,000
I can drink a water.

511
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Yeah, I drink cloud, whatever.

512
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Do you have a problem?

513
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Why did you send me a number?

514
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
You want me to look up a number?

515
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Okay, what is it?

516
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Okay, okay.

517
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
What is this?

518
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,000
A friend said the art reminded him of someone in our class.

519
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Who did that?

520
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Who did it look like in our class?

521
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Who in our class looks like that?

522
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Oh, my God.

523
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Oh, my God.

524
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:19,000
This is what you like to look at?

525
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,000
I think I should just go back to the project,

526
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,000
because I don't even know if we should be in the same room together anymore.

527
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,000
It's kind of weird to me now.

528
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:38,000
It's kind of weird to me now, girl.

529
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Anyways, I will continue to type up the paper.

530
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Is that okay with you if I type up the paper?

531
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Or do you want to type up the paper?

532
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:08,000
I don't want to look at the art you like anymore.

533
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
I don't really think this is art.

534
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
This is just weird.

535
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Why are you so mean?

536
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Come on, why?

537
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Don't understand.

538
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
You want to type it?

539
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
You want me to type it?

540
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
I can type it.

541
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
You already wrote some strong bits.

542
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Okay, fine.

543
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Fine, fine, fine.

544
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
You can just lay on the bed.

545
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Shoot me some ideas to write about for our literature,

546
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
history literature paper.

547
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:51,000
About 18th century literature, yeah.

548
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
What?

549
00:50:52,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Okay, I can add that.

550
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
I don't like that word.

551
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:13,000
What's another word for big?

552
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:17,000
What's another word for big?

553
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Yeah, I know, I could look it up in this episode.

554
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:27,000
I don't want.

555
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
What's another word for cylinder?

556
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Big cylinder?

557
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Humongous?

558
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Okay, humongous cylinder, but from your own cylinder or something?

559
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:50,000
That cylinder is so basic.

560
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Massive.

561
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
I like massive.

562
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Massive cylinders are good.

563
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Rod?

564
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
I get it.

565
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Rod is a cylinder.

566
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Shaft?

567
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Hmm, let me see how it works.

568
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:18,000
In this essay, me and anonymous, I can call you that, right?

569
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Yeah?

570
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Okay.

571
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Will be analyzing the historical importance of humongous rods in 18th century literature.

572
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Yes, I think that's good.

573
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Do you think that does that sound okay to you?

574
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
No credit?

575
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
What do you mean no credit?

576
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
That's your name.

577
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
You write that every time I look at your paper.

578
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
I'm not cheating on you or anything.

579
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
I'm not cheating off of you.

580
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,000
I mean, it's not like we were together in the first place.

581
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
It's not like I could cheat on you anyway.

582
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
It's not like I ignored it suddenly.

583
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,000
I mean, cheat off your papers.

584
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
I mean, no, I don't.

585
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
No, I don't.

586
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
How can you cheat off your papers?

587
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:32,000
You write your name as anonymous, so I thought that was your name.

588
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Let me, I'm just going to Google some photos for the insert into the paper of humongous

589
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
rods in 18th century.

590
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Okay.

591
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Humongous rods in 18th century literature.

592
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Excuse me.

593
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Oh, I didn't know they had this sort of stuff back then, but this is not what I meant.

594
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
I don't, what is going on in this photo?

595
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Can you come here?

596
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Come here.

597
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Come here.

598
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Get off the bed.

599
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Come here.

600
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Come here.

601
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Come here.

602
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Come here.

603
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Come here.

604
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Come here.

605
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Come here.

606
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Come here.

607
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Come here.

608
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Come here.

609
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Come here.

610
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Come here.

611
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Can you tell me what's on it?

612
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
It's a what.

613
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Or don't, what?

614
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
No way.

615
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:40,000
You're joking.

616
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Humongous rods.

617
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:49,000
That's something like a humongous rod I was looking for.

618
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
That's so weird.

619
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:55,000
I was like, I'm sorry.

620
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:07,560
Ok get away from me Particularly

621
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:14,080
It's amazing press I don't...

622
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:17,280
Of All this just like what animals do I can't put that in

623
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:21,720
Yea Yea Yea lets add that

624
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:24,480
And during research

625
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:52,480
What's the author's name? What was the author's name of that article? Do you remember the teacher told us in class?

626
00:55:54,480 --> 00:56:10,480
Does anybody know? Because I don't know. Do you know what the author's name was? I can't really remember. I have a really bad memory.

627
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:21,480
Why do I think the teacher is quite the killer? So if we write this stuff, I don't know if we're not in the mood. It's fine. It's fine.

628
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:38,480
Oh yeah, Hugh Janus. Yeah, okay. Yeah, but the author's Hugh and Janus. Well, the Janus or Janus? Janus? Okay.

629
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:56,480
Oh yeah, I forgot about the author, Mike Coney. Mike Coney was very prevalent. Very important in this day and age. Let me look up Mike Coney.

630
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:37,480
I don't know what these tacos are doing on this, but that's fun. Some of these girls look like me. What's up with that?

631
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:59,480
I'll add that in. Oh, the teacher mentioned something about a very important event over. Oh my gosh, you're right. I see. I'm kind of, you know what?

632
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:14,480
I apologize for picking on you earlier. You see, I know that you're really smart and I'm sorry that sometimes I take you for granted and I'm really sorry about that.

633
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:32,480
I'm sorry for all the names I called you behind your back. Like, I called you stinky and I thought you were weird and I said you were dumb and I said you have no friends and no one will love you and that you're a piece of trash, but I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it, okay?

634
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:49,480
Um, but let me add that stuff. The reconnaissance or the renaissance?

635
00:58:50,480 --> 00:59:00,480
Okay. There's a lot of good names. Thank you. Keep them coming. Keep them coming. Keep them coming.

636
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:29,480
Hmm. There's a lot of good information. Especially after the earthquake in Italy during a holy day. Okay. Do you kind of like when I insult you?

637
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:39,480
Do you like when I insult you? That's weird.

638
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:26,480
It was the start of the enlightenment. Yes, but that was 16th century. It was not 18th century. Thank you, other classmate, that's happened to poke her head into the room.

639
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:55,480
Okay. I messed up. I need to raise this tie by a graph. Oh, I can hold down the button. Oh. Anyway. You have self-esteem problems? Why do you have self-esteem problems? You don't need self-esteem problems.

640
01:00:55,480 --> 01:01:20,480
I know you smell bad, but I guess you're a little cute. Only a little. Forget I said it. You're still weird. I'm not talking through after this project.

641
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:40,480
That's a lot of typing.

642
01:01:40,480 --> 01:02:06,480
There's an illustrative work on the treatment of 18th century prisons reenact the present day. Okay. I'll type that in.

643
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:34,480
What did you say? You want me to go out with you? I can't do that. My mom says I'm not allowed to date. I'll think about it.

644
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:47,480
Oh. Those are images. I don't think we can include this in our project. I need a tissue.

645
01:02:47,480 --> 01:03:16,480
Can you pass me the tissue? This is my normal thing now. You're rubbing a tissue over your face before you get it.

646
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:38,480
I think I hear my mom coming. She's probably going to ask us if we want any food, so you can tell her what you want.

647
01:03:38,480 --> 01:04:04,480
Honey, did you and your friend want to snack? Oh, you'll tell me later. All right. Keep me in the nose, sweetheart.

648
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:22,480
You've got to tell me what you want, and then I'll tell my mom. Oh, hi. I think we have more classmates joining us for our project.

649
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:30,480
We are writing about 18th century literature and its impact on history.

650
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:41,480
My name is Shababani.

651
01:04:41,480 --> 01:05:08,480
Stop saying my mom is hot. She's nice, but she's not hot. My aunt taught her. My aunt, she'd be really hot. She runs a hotel. It's really cool. I'm not there sometimes. She lets me swim in the pool. You like pool?

652
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:12,480
Yeah? Oh, maybe I'll make you some time.

653
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:28,480
Have you heard of it? It's called Wonderland Hotel. How's it go? Like an Alice Wonderland thing? It's pretty cool.

654
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:39,480
My mom? I don't know what the other one is.

655
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:53,480
I haven't seen her talk to anybody. She never brings people around. And if they do, they're usually wearing a mask, and usually it's a weird scary mask, and mom doesn't like it when she brings them around.

656
01:05:53,480 --> 01:06:01,480
They're also on leashes. I don't know why. But I like the style, though. That's why I wear this collar. I think it's cute.

657
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:21,480
My older brother says it makes me look subby. I don't know what subby means. I like sub. Yeah, I'll take you some time. I guess. She's not a date or anything. It's not a date.

658
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:37,480
Um, anyways, I think I'm done with typing. Can you, like, proofread this for me?

659
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:53,480
Come on. Sorry. My family is little hands. I don't know if you know this.

660
01:06:53,480 --> 01:07:19,480
Subby is playing for Subaru with cars. Oh, I like cars. Cars are cool. They go vroom. Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom.

661
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:25,480
Yeah, we're bullhound rabbits.

662
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:51,480
Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom. Do you like cars? I like cars.

663
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:56,120
I um, I can lightning McQueen. Yeah

664
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:00,300
You like lightning McQueen? I love cars

665
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:09,960
Um, so what do you think of the paper?

666
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:20,600
Okay

667
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:26,680
I guess I can rewrite this paragraph or maybe I should just make you do it

668
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:29,400
Since you want to be so bossy and just lay on my back

669
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:34,920
You know what I should do

670
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:44,920
I want you to stand up

671
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:48,360
Stand up

672
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:51,240
Thank you

673
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:54,360
Sit at the computer and type it yourself

674
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:03,720
Go on

675
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:08,520
Good

676
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:13,160
Wait, wait, wait, you got it to put that there

677
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:18,200
You got it? No, you got it

678
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:24,760
Dude, let me move over. Okay, so you got it. You don't want to use this program, do you? And then

679
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:28,040
You gotta do this

680
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:31,720
And then

681
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:36,760
No, you you have really bad grammar. Why do you keep typing stuff wrong?

682
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:40,280
Are you like dumb or something?

683
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:43,240
I can't I thought you were smart

684
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:47,240
Oh

685
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:49,640
Yeah, just type it like that

686
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:53,400
Perfect

687
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:55,640
Now keep going

688
01:09:57,080 --> 01:10:03,160
Why did you type that doesn't make any sense? No, your syntax is all wrong. Don't move over. How much?

689
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:08,040
You have to type it like this

690
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:14,360
Like that that makes more sense. Okay, does that make more sense to you?

691
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:19,320
You're trying to get a rise out of me? You're getting distracted

692
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:23,800
What's distracting me? What's the matter?

693
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:37,160
I'm close to you? What's um, I'm not that close. Is there something wrong with me being really close?

694
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:43,160
I don't mind being close to you

695
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:46,920
I think I'm getting used to how you smell

696
01:10:55,640 --> 01:11:00,840
I'm sorry, I know this is stuffy, but I can't stop smelling you

697
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:04,760
So

698
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:08,280

Um

01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:22,280
You want me to say something again, I don't think I should do that

706
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:25,880
Um

I'm starting to wonder if you should have done this project at his house, sweetie

738
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:35,720
Um

739
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:38,200
Can we have some goldfish?

740
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:41,800
Yeah, we can have some goldfish. Okay. Thank you

741
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:47,160

01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:56,760
Um, I think she'll bring us apple juice

744
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,400
I don't know if you heard her

745
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:06,920
I don't have any mom's strategy mom says energy drinks are bad for me. So I don't

746
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:09,880

748
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:14,440
Although my brother might have some in the room

749
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:19,640
I can go sneak in but he doesn't like it when I go into the room. He gets real weird about it

750
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:25,080
I think I've actually seen one of those like dojinshi things dojinchais

751
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:27,000
um

752
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:34,440
He also likes to watch a lot of hentie. I've heard him listening to hentie. He said it's really intense fighting

753
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:36,440
um

754
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:37,880
cartoons

755
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:42,600
So I can't just leave him to it. Um when he's interested when he's doing that

756
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:46,520
um

757
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:52,200
Hey the goldfish mom you forgot the apple juice, sir

759
01:15:56,760 --> 01:16:01,080

761
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:12,920
Okay, okay you the apple juice, but you cannot speak to me that way

762
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:15,880
Okay, mom I'm sorry

763
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:22,360
Okay, I'll be right back

764
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:45,080

01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:02,680
I know I shouldn't I shouldn't talk I'm just like

766
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:11,640
I just want to impress you and I don't want you to think that I'm like a pushover because of my mom or whatever

767
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:15,640
Uh

768
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:17,320

01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:20,040
My mom is kind of wet. I don't know that mean

770
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:24,680
Where did you get that picture from to hold that up in front of your face? That's weird

771
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:29,000
How it's like my aunt? Huh weird. She likes to wear heels like that

772

01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:46,440
Are you to be the older one? I'm childish. What do you mean me and me and so britney are the same age we're twins

774
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:57,960
I remember others the older and then I do have more siblings, but they'll be introducing a later episode

775
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
You're a pushover regardless of your mom

788
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:41,800
Yeah

789
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Why are you making that face?

790
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:06,760
Why are you covering your pants with your hands?

791
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:10,440
I never get boys

792
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:20,360
Anyways, I'm gonna drink my apple juice. Oh accidentally got over me. Oh, no

793
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:26,200
I got apple juice over my head

01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:33,160
That's not with a couple

795
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:39,160
Mm-hmm

796
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:51,880
If you want to sip yeah, I know you have your own but I'm just offering to share

797
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:53,880
Hmm

798
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:06,520
Mm

799
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:24,840
Uh

800
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:35,080
That's pretty good

801
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:39,240
Okay, so yourself

802
01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:48,120
Can we hold hands I don't know my hands are sticky

803
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:51,080
It is for the apple juice

804
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:56,040
I don't think that would be a good idea

805
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:21,080
I

806
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:42,760
Aren't some wet wipes next to my bed

807
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:54,920
Sorry, I have the tendency to chew with my mouth open

808
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:08,440
No, I got off of you. I'm not on top of you anymore

809
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:21,080
I'm not on top of you

810
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:36,760
Wait, I dropped some fishies on the floor. Hold on

811
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:43,160
Um

812
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:51,080
I

813
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:54,760
Let me move my body

814
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:00,920
There you go

815
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:07,240
Oh, there's some fishies on the floor

816
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:14,360
I think I'm wearing a good floor fishies

817
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:20,120
Hmm

818
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:34,600
Ah

819
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:37,560
That was good

820
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:40,760
Why are you making that face?

821
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:51,240
I like the cheese five second rule

822
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:09,640
You get too close, what do you mean I'm too close? I'm just I'm just getting some food

823
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:16,600
You have a little something on your face

824
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:34,120
I don't know why you were eating but it's pretty tasty

825
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:44,120
Why are you looking at me like that I was just helping you wipe your face

826
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:03,720
Did I just look your face I guess you could call it that

827
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:12,200
But um, I don't know in my culture. It's normal to like

828
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:20,520
Don't worry about it, okay

829
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:30,760
Don't worry about it

830
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:38,840
Yeah, I could use a tissue, but I thought it'd just be faster

831
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:43,320
Than crossing the whole room for a tissue and coming back

832
01:26:45,720 --> 01:26:48,280
Since my culture, can I do the same to me?

833
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:52,600
You

834
01:26:53,480 --> 01:26:55,480
Um

835
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:57,800
I I guess

836
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:02,840
I guess you can

837
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:11,800
Um, okay, I guess I'll I guess I'll get a little closer

838
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:16,520
Um, okay

839
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:19,960

01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:36,840
Uh feels funny

842
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:41,320
Why are you doing it like that?

843
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:48,360
Okay, stop it's not particularly me stop it

844
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:55,240
Okay

845
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
Kind of

846
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:01,160
I'm kind of sobbered on me

847
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:04,040

Let me shrink my head

854
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
Why are you barking at me?

855
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:50,760
I it was just a joke

856
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:55,400
Do you actually want to be my pet?

857
01:28:58,040 --> 01:29:00,040
It's so weird

858
01:29:00,440 --> 01:29:02,440

01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:59,080
When they come over they're so usually a different one every time she comes over they always wear a mask

878
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:05,560
My mom says she might stop inviting aunt she be over but I really like aunt she be

879
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:11,160
She has a lot of money and she has a hotel and I get to jump and sleep in the beds in order room service

880
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:13,800
As much as I want

881
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:21,080
And she has like servants take care of me whenever I need something and they will buy me stuff and get me candy

882
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:24,520
It's really nice

883
01:31:30,440 --> 01:31:33,720
It's 2024 pretty close a lot of play all the video games you want

884
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:38,920
I don't know my brother says that video games are only for boys. So

885
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:42,040
Yeah

886
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:50,840
What kind of hotel it's wonderland hotel it's a nice hotel she won't let me go into the basement though

887
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:55,720
I don't know. It's in the basement, but sometimes I hear people screaming in the basement

888
01:31:56,920 --> 01:32:01,160
I don't know what people do in the basement. She said it's um

889
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:04,040
Adult it's an adult playroom

890
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:08,760
Like for big kids and I'm not a big enough kid yet

891
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:12,600
So I can't do it

892
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:24,360
Hotel song from letter. Yeah, my aunt runs the hotel. You've probably heard about it. It's a very famous hotel. Mm-hmm

893
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:26,600
Mm-hmm

894
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:32,760
You play league I have

895
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:36,520
No, I don't play league

896
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:39,800
One of my friends from school does though

897
01:32:43,160 --> 01:32:47,720
She's really cute. She's like a lamb and she's green

898
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:52,440
Our moms are like cool lady

899
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:58,840
I tried to play that game. I don't like it that much

900
01:33:03,480 --> 01:33:07,640
Melania, what are you doing? Melania get out from under my desk

901
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:15,160
Why are your eyes so big?

902
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:18,920
Oh

903
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
Oh

904
01:33:21,320 --> 01:33:23,800
Yeah, that's her mom's name. Her mom's name is Azura

905
01:33:26,120 --> 01:33:33,000
She's hot. She's really big bazonga hangers. I can't help but stare every time her mom picks her up from school

906
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:36,600
What games did I play?

907
01:33:36,680 --> 01:33:38,520
um

908
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:40,520
I play um like

909
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:43,960
I play like

910
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
I play like animal crossing

911
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:54,520
Well, my brother says it's a game for babies, but I don't care. I like it. I like mario pie

912
01:33:58,040 --> 01:34:00,040
Yeah

913
01:34:02,920 --> 01:34:04,920
They're they're pretty mesmerizing

914
01:34:05,960 --> 01:34:07,960
What's the vn

915
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:10,440
A visual novel

916
01:34:11,240 --> 01:34:14,520
I don't really like reading reading is for losers

917
01:34:15,480 --> 01:34:19,720
And I know you're like a loser and all but like

918
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:25,400
Don't just because we're doing this project together doesn't mean they're our friends

919
01:34:27,720 --> 01:34:33,880
Just because I showed you parts of my my zolehan bunny culture doesn't doesn't mean anything

920
01:34:34,680 --> 01:34:39,640
So don't let it get to your head as auntie she be says don't get it twisted

921
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:46,840
Auntie she be usually gets twisted up and something because she wears ropes on her body mom won't explain to me

922
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:51,000
Not why um auntie she be does that so I stopped asking

923
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:58,440
But then your sister read all the time she does she's a loser. I don't like my sister. She's weird

924
01:34:58,440 --> 01:35:01,640
She just her room is black. She always has her shades drawn

925
01:35:01,880 --> 01:35:07,720
She she just like cries all the time and like she has like leaves ketchup packets everywhere

926
01:35:08,440 --> 01:35:11,480
And her room just smells of ketchup. It's really weird

927
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:14,600
My mom says she's going through a phase

928
01:35:15,240 --> 01:35:17,240
I don't know

929
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:23,240
No, I don't want to be friends. I don't want to be friends with you. You're just

930
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:27,320
A weirdo

931
01:35:28,040 --> 01:35:30,040
Just because we hang out

932
01:35:31,480 --> 01:35:33,480
One time doesn't mean

933
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:36,200
weird friends or

934
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:40,920
Boyfriend girlfriend or anything. Yeah, I said I take you to the wonderland hotel, but

935
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:45,880
Don't um, it doesn't mean anything. I'm just being nice

936
01:35:48,120 --> 01:35:50,120
Hmm

937
01:35:50,680 --> 01:35:52,680
I'm just being nice

938
01:35:59,240 --> 01:36:01,880
Oh, you've heard of my sister she's so weird

939
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:08,920
I'm not I I still like to think about it and I thought about it. I don't want to go out with you. You're weird

940
01:36:14,680 --> 01:36:16,680
But I

941
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:22,600
Like I do need to keep you around to help me with my homework. So

942
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:26,200
You'll be my pet

943
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:28,120
Got it

944
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:29,800
I'll get you

945
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:34,360
A nice leash and I'll drag you around school with it

946
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:39,320
I think that's a good compromise, isn't it?

947
01:36:47,960 --> 01:36:51,480
My head bigger. Oh, and I have a really big head

948
01:36:56,200 --> 01:36:58,200
Let me get a little closer

949
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:01,880
You

950
01:37:05,960 --> 01:37:07,960
Will you be my pet

951
01:37:10,120 --> 01:37:14,520
My my aunt taught me this trick. Do you want to see a trick?

952
01:37:16,360 --> 01:37:18,360
I have a leash

953
01:37:19,240 --> 01:37:21,240
I know my hand doesn't match my body

954
01:37:23,160 --> 01:37:25,880
But don't worry about that. I have a leash

955
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:29,960
So I always have one on hand

956
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:33,800
I'll tighten it when necessary

957
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:38,200
Okay

958
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:45,160
And then every time you see me in the homies you have to drop to your knees and you have to kiss my shoes

959
01:37:46,840 --> 01:37:48,840
Got it

960
01:37:49,400 --> 01:37:51,400
While you kiss my shoes

961
01:37:56,120 --> 01:37:59,480
How do I have them? I just I don't know

962
01:38:00,280 --> 01:38:02,280
I have it

963
01:38:04,760 --> 01:38:06,760
So will you be my puppy?

964
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:11,400
I'll take care of you

965
01:38:11,960 --> 01:38:19,320
I'll call you bad name and I'll take you for walking and maybe I'll let you sleep under my bed

966
01:38:20,200 --> 01:38:29,560
Okay, do you want to have a sleepover? Maybe I'll let you sleep with me by my hand

967
01:38:35,640 --> 01:38:39,080
And you can call me mistress, step up in me

968
01:38:39,080 --> 01:38:41,080
And

969
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:48,360
Appropriate school? Well, it's only inappropriate if the teachers find out, isn't it?

970
01:38:49,240 --> 01:38:51,880
But teachers don't have to find out anything, do they?

971
01:38:54,200 --> 01:38:56,280
It will be our little secret, won't it?

972
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:07,240
Looks like you're already excited to get started

973
01:39:09,240 --> 01:39:15,800
Should we practice some training?

974
01:39:25,240 --> 01:39:32,120
What's wrong with your pants? They look like they're getting bigger. What's up with that?

975
01:39:33,080 --> 01:39:38,920
Why does that keep happening? Are you hiding something in there? I want to see

976
01:39:45,160 --> 01:39:47,160
I think you should show me what's going on

977
01:39:49,880 --> 01:39:51,880
And once we take care of that problem

978
01:39:54,760 --> 01:39:56,760
Then maybe we can get started

979
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:04,760
Hmm

980
01:40:10,360 --> 01:40:14,200
It's your phone? Your phone is very warm

981
01:40:16,840 --> 01:40:19,320
Hmm, I just want to

982
01:40:19,320 --> 01:40:21,320
Uh

983
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:31,320
Nah, your phone's a weird shape. Are you sure? Are you hiding something from me?

984
01:40:35,400 --> 01:40:37,880
You know, bunnies have very good noses

985
01:40:38,440 --> 01:40:40,440
I

986
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:49,480
Think something in there is making me sneeze. I have to check it out

987
01:40:55,880 --> 01:41:00,280
It's very smells stronger than you

988
01:41:00,280 --> 01:41:02,280
Hmm

989
01:41:07,400 --> 01:41:09,400
There's something about it that I like

990
01:41:17,880 --> 01:41:21,160
All right, are you gonna show me or what?

991
01:41:26,840 --> 01:41:28,840
Go on

992
01:41:31,080 --> 01:41:33,080
Oh

993
01:41:41,640 --> 01:41:43,640
What's that?

994
01:41:45,640 --> 01:41:49,160
Um, what is that?

995
01:41:53,080 --> 01:41:55,080
Hmm

996
01:41:57,800 --> 01:41:59,800
Hmm

997
01:42:00,600 --> 01:42:07,080
I didn't expect to see that

998
01:42:08,600 --> 01:42:10,600
Um

999
01:42:14,680 --> 01:42:21,960
I've never seen one of these in person before

1000
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:23,960
Uh

1001
01:42:28,680 --> 01:42:30,680
Can I

1002
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:34,520
Have a taste

1003
01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:36,520
Hmm

1004
01:42:47,800 --> 01:42:54,200
I can't believe you got the limited edition orange creamsicle from lint chocolate. It's so tasty

1005
01:42:55,080 --> 01:42:57,080
I know you're hiding something from me

1006
01:42:58,440 --> 01:43:01,640
You know, I love orange flavored stuff. I'm a bunny

1007
01:43:05,480 --> 01:43:10,360
Now it's a hot day too. Did you take this from my mom's fridge? I bet you did

1008
01:43:12,760 --> 01:43:14,760
Hmm

1009
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:17,160
Whatever it can't be helped

1010
01:43:19,080 --> 01:43:25,000
I know my mom says she was gonna get these, you know, you really shouldn't put ice cream in your pocket. It's kind of weird

1011
01:43:30,520 --> 01:43:33,240
Well, it's mine now, thank you

1012
01:43:35,240 --> 01:43:37,240
Yum

1013
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:46,840
I'm also finishing off your apple juice because you took too long to finish it

1014
01:43:46,840 --> 01:43:48,840
You

1015
01:44:00,920 --> 01:44:04,840
Thought it was gonna last longer. I don't know how popsicles work silly

1016
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:13,800
You want to share him

1017
01:44:13,800 --> 01:44:15,800
Okay

1018
01:44:29,160 --> 01:44:31,160
How on make a music

All right, I'm taking it back it's mine

1020
01:44:53,640 --> 01:44:55,640
Don't ask why it's blue

1021
01:45:14,280 --> 01:45:16,280
Oh

1022
01:45:28,440 --> 01:45:30,440
I don't know if I can handle a little popsicle

1023
01:45:34,040 --> 01:45:36,040
Yeah, it's a long popsicle

1024
01:45:36,040 --> 01:45:38,040
Almost as big as my head

1025
01:45:38,200 --> 01:45:45,400
Actually, this is because of my head. Why am I supposed to fit this all in my mouth? I don't know if I can

1026
01:45:51,640 --> 01:45:53,640
How convenient that I can get it to change size

1027
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
Look I can fit it across my teeth

1028
01:46:03,880 --> 01:46:05,880
Um

1029
01:46:06,200 --> 01:46:08,760
Wow, did you want the rest?

1030
01:46:13,720 --> 01:46:15,720

There you go the leaders

1036
01:46:56,680 --> 01:46:58,680
Is there an earthquake what's happening?

1037
01:47:02,440 --> 01:47:07,320
I tend to lose my head a lot my mom says I need to control my dillahum powers better

1048
01:48:56,600 --> 01:48:58,600
I

1049
01:49:04,680 --> 01:49:09,000
Have two tips. Yeah, I've two tips, you know, I did say you could take a shower if you want

1050
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:13,560
Since you said your water wasn't working at your house

1051
01:49:17,960 --> 01:49:24,680
Guys I was joking I was joking it was a joke. I never share my popsicles with my brothers that'd be weird

1052
01:49:27,160 --> 01:49:29,160
You

1053
01:49:38,680 --> 01:49:40,680
And in me I don't know who in me is

1054
01:49:44,360 --> 01:49:46,360
Oh, wait, I go to school with an in me

1055
01:49:47,560 --> 01:49:51,160
And an icy I always see them together. They're really best friends

1056
01:49:52,520 --> 01:49:54,520
They're nice

1057
01:49:55,480 --> 01:49:59,480
And me always usually has a weird doll with her though and she always wears um

1058
01:50:00,040 --> 01:50:03,800
This really old sweatshirt. It kind of creeps me out and she has this book with her all the time

1059
01:50:04,520 --> 01:50:06,520
I'm too scared to ask her what's in it

1060
01:50:17,480 --> 01:50:19,480
Let me just stop moving

1061
01:50:25,480 --> 01:50:27,480
I

1062
01:50:46,600 --> 01:50:48,600
Let's follow recipes

1063
01:50:55,000 --> 01:51:00,120
Timeline I don't know anything about timelines. Um, do you want to

1064
01:51:02,280 --> 01:51:09,080
A shower together, um, I don't think that'd be okay with my mom

1065
01:51:10,760 --> 01:51:12,760
Um

1066
01:51:16,440 --> 01:51:21,560
I see it's part of a train business. Yeah, her parents. Um her family. Um

1067
01:51:22,360 --> 01:51:24,760
Well, they're bears I think so I'm not really quite sure

1068
01:51:25,160 --> 01:51:28,280
But I think one of her relatives is in the train industry

1069
01:51:28,680 --> 01:51:35,960
And so she's kind of like inherited that I'm not quite sure I have heard about trains. Um on ic so I don't know

1070
01:51:36,920 --> 01:51:38,920
I'm not quite sure

1071
01:51:41,080 --> 01:51:43,880
Um, but I don't think we can do that together

1072
01:51:46,840 --> 01:51:48,840
So, uh

1073
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:56,600

02:06:02,440 --> 02:06:08,120
Pain completely enveloped in my smell

1172
02:06:14,280 --> 02:06:16,280
I guess you're not so bad

1173
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:25,720
You didn't want to use my brother's a 7-in-1. Yeah, I don't know why you bought that

1174
02:06:25,800 --> 02:06:29,480
I think he got off some like black market website or something. He's weird

1175
02:06:30,360 --> 02:06:32,600
He likes to go on this place called um

1176
02:06:33,880 --> 02:06:35,880
uh

1177
02:06:37,800 --> 02:06:41,720
Six six tune I think I don't know

1178
02:06:43,720 --> 02:06:46,680
He's really secretive about it. He won't let me use this computer

1179
02:06:47,240 --> 02:06:49,880
I don't know what kind of stuff he has on there and I'm too scared to find out

1180
02:06:52,360 --> 02:06:55,320
You'll pay me back. You promise

1181
02:07:00,600 --> 02:07:02,600

1182
02:07:16,680 --> 02:07:22,680
I'm trying to move on my body

1183
02:07:37,800 --> 02:07:41,560
Um, I guess um

1184
02:07:41,560 --> 02:07:48,840
Are we done with our project and studying?

1185
02:07:52,680 --> 02:07:57,400
When are we supposed to turn this in again?

1186
02:08:05,240 --> 02:08:07,240
Two weeks from now

1187
02:08:07,480 --> 02:08:09,240
Oh

1188
02:08:09,240 --> 02:08:10,920
Huh

1189
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
I thought it was sooner than that

1190
02:08:14,760 --> 02:08:21,080
I guess you'll have to come over every day so we can focus on the project, right?

1191
02:08:26,040 --> 02:08:28,440
We still got so much research to do

1192
02:08:31,880 --> 02:08:35,080
And I still have to train you

1193
02:08:35,160 --> 02:08:42,360
To make sure you look the most perfect little puppy

1194
02:08:44,520 --> 02:08:46,520
I mean

1195
02:08:50,520 --> 02:08:52,520
We have to

1196
02:08:54,200 --> 02:08:59,400
reread some passages and um

1197
02:09:01,480 --> 02:09:03,480
Maybe

1198
02:09:04,440 --> 02:09:07,240
Do some extra research with each other

1199
02:09:09,960 --> 02:09:12,440
Next time you should

1200
02:09:13,880 --> 02:09:18,280
Bring your laptop so you can study on my bed

1201
02:09:19,720 --> 02:09:21,720
Open my books

1202
02:09:23,240 --> 02:09:26,120
And then you won't have to leave my bed ever

1203
02:09:29,400 --> 02:09:32,040
Yeah, does that sound good?

1204
02:09:34,200 --> 02:09:36,200
If we get an A

1205
02:09:38,840 --> 02:09:41,240
I'll give you a special present

1206
02:09:45,960 --> 02:09:48,440

02:13:31,240 --> 02:13:37,320
Again, I'm still trying to figure out the settings for these things. How does this sound tinny?

1227
02:13:42,760 --> 02:13:45,160
Maybe it's I don't know

1228
02:13:45,160 --> 02:13:47,160
Hmm

1229
02:13:55,080 --> 02:13:56,760
I

1230
02:13:56,760 --> 02:14:01,800
My my niece needs to see the world. I'm gonna there's lots of different people that come into the hotel

1231
02:14:01,800 --> 02:14:04,120
I have to show them what they'll she's what they're like

1232
02:14:08,280 --> 02:14:11,960
The mic peaks when you raise your voice, okay good to know thank you. Thank you

1233
02:14:15,240 --> 02:14:20,760
Yes, you know she's getting it stuck or I'm gonna have to call and step she I think they do have step sibling

1234
02:14:22,360 --> 02:14:25,880
Because I think I think her older brother is a step brother. I can't I can't recall

1235
02:14:27,080 --> 02:14:29,080
I'm not super close with my sister's kids

1236
02:14:31,400 --> 02:14:35,880
Every once in a while, um, I'll pick up shabbani and shabbathani

1237
02:14:38,600 --> 02:14:42,520
She wanted to be called mistress. Oh, I don't know where she got that from

1238
02:14:45,480 --> 02:14:49,880
What is causing the floating head syndrome with my outfits, um

1239
02:14:51,080 --> 02:14:53,080
So I'll show you actually

1240
02:14:53,960 --> 02:14:58,760
So what I use so these are booth booth assets that you see

1241
02:15:00,200 --> 02:15:03,800
So let's say I'll use this one for example the one I used for shabbani

1242
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,000
So this is literally a little asset

1243
02:15:09,480 --> 02:15:11,240
And

1244
02:15:11,240 --> 02:15:13,240
you have to

1245
02:15:13,560 --> 02:15:18,120
Kind of click it but the physics sometimes can be a lot

1246
02:15:19,480 --> 02:15:21,480
And so what I have to do

1247
02:15:22,520 --> 02:15:24,520
because each time

1248
02:15:24,600 --> 02:15:29,320
I'm going to do a zero was showing me she made a toggle where it takes her head

1249
02:15:31,640 --> 02:15:38,200
Her I have to go through and make a toggle where I have to literally make everything transparent besides my neck

1250
02:15:38,200 --> 02:15:44,360
And head and hair and ears and they're like really my lower half

1251
02:15:45,240 --> 02:15:47,880
And then I need to make a toggle of that so I can do it a lot easier

1252
02:15:47,880 --> 02:15:51,720
So it sticks a little bit better as you can see when this is the asset

1253
02:15:52,120 --> 02:15:55,400
It sticks a lot better when my head is the asset in vtube studio

1254
02:15:55,480 --> 02:16:00,360
It doesn't stick as well, but I kind of like the charm of that the little like added lower, you know

1255
02:16:00,360 --> 02:16:02,360
Yeah

1256
02:16:06,440 --> 02:16:10,760
Yeah, so like I'll show you so this is the head

1257
02:16:12,200 --> 02:16:16,440
I it's imported and saved as a asset

1258
02:16:18,520 --> 02:16:20,520
In vtube studio

1259
02:16:20,920 --> 02:16:22,920
I don't save it as a model

1260
02:16:23,080 --> 02:16:26,440
Because then I would have to change my model each time and I don't want to do that

1261
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,000
So you can see here. Oh look

1262
02:16:30,520 --> 02:16:32,520
There's two of me

1263
02:16:34,520 --> 02:16:41,560
Um if I put this on it clips over and so but it only will stick properly

1264
02:16:46,840 --> 02:16:48,840
You can see the physics

1265
02:16:48,920 --> 02:16:50,920
Get a little wonky with it

1266
02:16:51,160 --> 02:16:56,200
And I've dialed down all the physics. It's just how the I think it's just how it's rigged. Um

1267
02:16:57,160 --> 02:17:03,400
But yeah, you can see even when it's near pinned to my model it kind of floats around

1268
02:17:05,240 --> 02:17:07,240
I still have to figure that out

1269
02:17:11,240 --> 02:17:14,040
Yeah, that's how that works. That's a little behind the scenes

1270
02:17:16,440 --> 02:17:18,440
It kind of looks like my hair is behind

1271
02:17:19,400 --> 02:17:21,400
Ha

1272
02:17:25,640 --> 02:17:27,640
Oh

1273
02:17:32,600 --> 02:17:37,080
Should be three head strikes again a different kind of boing boing

1274
02:17:39,720 --> 02:17:41,720
Okay

1275
02:17:42,680 --> 02:17:44,680
Yeah, shivers I'll be telling you

1276
02:17:46,840 --> 02:17:48,840
Did you pin it to a wobbly piece of hair?

1277
02:17:49,320 --> 02:17:52,520
Honestly, it's hard to tell because I try to pin it to

1278
02:17:53,560 --> 02:17:55,560
like my chest area

1279
02:17:55,720 --> 02:17:57,720
Or my neck and it just doesn't

1280
02:17:58,440 --> 02:18:04,360
Want to stick I've even minimized my model really small to see if I could place the asset over it and kind of make it

1281
02:18:04,440 --> 02:18:06,440
More stable. It doesn't work either

1282
02:18:06,600 --> 02:18:13,800
Um, I know Serenity from me knew I was gonna help me with that any other girls with that so

1283
02:18:15,880 --> 02:18:17,880
Um, but let's see

1284
02:18:18,440 --> 02:18:21,960
I will see you guys later. I am super fucking tired

1285
02:18:23,400 --> 02:18:25,400
She's the perfect woman remember that

1286
02:18:30,120 --> 02:18:34,200
Why does this have a debut under it when it should have I had some more

1287
02:18:35,080 --> 02:18:41,240
Actually, I'll put 3dio ASMR seems to be like get godly

1288
02:18:54,360 --> 02:18:56,360
Working on a project

1289
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:09,400
I did more of a project than studying because I forgot my own

1290
02:19:11,320 --> 02:19:13,320
The thing that came up with

1291
02:19:25,080 --> 02:19:27,080
Okay, let's see

1292
02:19:27,960 --> 02:19:29,960
Hmm

1293
02:19:31,960 --> 02:19:34,840
Probably anybody to raid so I guess I'll just end stream

1294
02:19:35,480 --> 02:19:37,960
Oh, I would read to emmy, but she's not here

1295
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:40,840
so, you know

1296
02:19:40,840 --> 02:19:43,880
Go out and do what you must in the world

1297
02:19:45,480 --> 02:19:48,520
And I hope you had a good time. Is there a streams later?

1298
02:19:49,880 --> 02:19:51,720
I believe

1299
02:19:51,720 --> 02:19:55,640
So have a good one. I know I still need to watch the new boys EP. I'm gonna do that right now

1300
02:19:56,600 --> 02:19:59,960
I'm gonna turn off my 3dio. I hope you guys have a lovely night

1301
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:03,000
um

1302
02:20:03,640 --> 02:20:05,640
I hope uh

1303
02:20:06,440 --> 02:20:08,440
You didn't read your bibles too hard

1304
02:20:09,320 --> 02:20:16,600
Uh, I will see you around. I'll see you tomorrow. We're gonna play 80s. I'm so excited. All right. Bye everyone

1305
02:20:17,560 --> 02:20:19,560
kisses

1306
02:20:25,960 --> 02:20:27,960
Kiss

1307
02:20:30,440 --> 02:20:35,560
Hey, did you take a shower or something you smell pretty good? Hmm interesting

1308
02:20:55,640 --> 02:20:57,640
You

1309
02:21:25,640 --> 02:21:27,640
You

1310
02:21:55,640 --> 02:21:57,640
You
