02:06:35,680 --> 02:06:40,560
uh an audio but not I don't know if I'll be able to get away with anything

702
02:06:40,800 --> 02:06:47,280
ooh alternative but um I don't think I will be in the mood to do that

703
02:06:52,800 --> 02:06:58,400
I was flying prena oh it was great it was amazing now I have to take off my shoes I didn't have to

704
02:06:58,400 --> 02:07:05,760
do that before um I also get really bad ear pain being on an airplane and that's why

705
02:07:06,480 --> 02:07:11,040
I don't like flying the last two the last place I traveled to you know yeah I drove

706
02:07:11,040 --> 02:07:14,640
I drove to Canada with friends that was fun you drove to Montreal

707
02:07:17,440 --> 02:07:21,760
and then I've driven to New York before with my parents

708
02:07:23,600 --> 02:07:26,160
yeah I also have to figure out I don't even know because like

709
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,480
I don't know I've asked my parents if they're gonna drive me to the airport

710
02:07:30,720 --> 02:07:36,960
I don't know I have to make sure my grandparents are my aunt because I have also

711
02:07:36,960 --> 02:07:40,720
have aunt and uncles they live down there so I'm gonna try to see

712
02:07:43,680 --> 02:07:51,120
firm yeah yeah TSA gets feet for free yeah I have I get really bad ear pain because one of

713
02:07:51,120 --> 02:07:54,240
my eustachian tubes is kind of sort of blocked because of my arthritis in my neck because of

714
02:07:54,240 --> 02:07:59,280
inflammation and all that other shit I've told you that before um so my ears really hurt so I'm

715
02:07:59,280 --> 02:08:06,640
gonna buy like a pack of gum hope for the best my mom has flown a lot she flew a lot for work um so

716
02:08:06,640 --> 02:08:12,880
she has a lot of she's already written me like a lot of advice um I it's so weird because I feel

717
02:08:12,880 --> 02:08:21,840
like a little kid again I feel like I am 16 15 again I forget how old I was flying to go see

718
02:08:21,840 --> 02:08:28,240
my grandparents and I was terrified back then and I'm terrified but they're older now they can't

719
02:08:28,240 --> 02:08:32,320
really fly so it's not it's better for me to travel rather than them

720
02:08:37,280 --> 02:08:42,000
hi I'm sorry I'm sorry I missed you guys too but you know like I'll tweet a bunch

721

722
02:08:50,640 --> 02:08:56,080
I'm trying to think I might I'm debating whether or not to like pre-record like some

723
02:08:56,080 --> 02:09:02,400
Hades gameplay or something um just so you guys like have a video that goes up and it's me playing

724
02:09:02,400 --> 02:09:09,920
or maybe meet just like a totally different game um like I'll play something else like a

725
02:09:09,920 --> 02:09:15,840
do a little like pseudo playthrough style thing and just do a quick like one shot of something

726
02:09:15,840 --> 02:09:21,920
and have that up as well just so you guys don't get too lonely um I see you think of a game to play

727
02:09:21,920 --> 02:09:27,360
so if you have any suggestions let me know yeah don't worry it's I won't I don't leave for eight

728
02:09:27,360 --> 02:09:35,040
days I don't I don't leave till the 18th y'all that's all indie playthrough yeah don't worry I

729
02:09:35,040 --> 02:09:38,800
just want to tell you guys in advance I didn't want to come first talk to be like surprise I'm

730
02:09:38,800 --> 02:09:43,760
not gonna be around but it's like it's halfway through the week so you still it won't feel

731
02:09:43,760 --> 02:09:51,280
too much like a week I don't think because like I'm leaving on I think a Friday or Thursday and

732
02:09:51,280 --> 02:09:56,880
I'm coming back on a Tuesday so it's just like kind of you guys almost won't have me for like a

733
02:09:56,880 --> 02:10:08,560
weekend or something Hoonipop no I want to play Hoonipop on blue twitch with no sensors um but

734
02:10:08,560 --> 02:10:14,640
yeah I just didn't I don't want you guys to stress um I'll probably just be like tweeting from the

735
02:10:14,640 --> 02:10:18,400
plane just like screaming in my head like just maybe I'll have a twitter space and be talking to

736
02:10:18,400 --> 02:10:26,480
myself like a crazy person next to the I got a window seat on the way there but I'm in the middle

737
02:10:26,480 --> 02:10:34,000
on the way back which I'm gonna hate I hope I'm not sitting next to weird people because I will

738
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:39,600
try to outweard them so that I feel safer

739
02:10:40,560 --> 02:10:41,200
uh

740
02:10:45,200 --> 02:10:55,200
you know getting good credit how about what I missed something

741
02:10:58,880 --> 02:11:02,560
I understand why there's no advance if your child is just moving safely yeah me too

742
02:11:02,560 --> 02:11:08,880
I just hope like my worst I like again you know OCD you always like think of the worst so I'm just

743
02:11:08,960 --> 02:11:15,120
like the plane's gonna go down uh something about I'm gonna lose my luggage this is gonna happen

744
02:11:15,120 --> 02:11:21,680
this is gonna happen um so like my mind goes like a million miles an hour

745
02:11:28,080 --> 02:11:36,320
definitely gonna need to I'm gonna charge up my switch um so I can play it on the plane and stuff

746
02:11:39,040 --> 02:11:41,360
I also have my laptop I could bring my laptop with me

747
02:11:43,520 --> 02:11:47,200
but I don't have like a portable mic to plug in because then I would just like png

748
02:11:48,880 --> 02:11:56,080
like stream and be like hi grandparents um I love you I'm gonna be locked in my room

749
02:11:56,720 --> 02:12:03,360
at like 12 at night and if you hear screaming don't worry about it but my grandparents would

750
02:12:03,520 --> 02:12:09,040
be absolutely mortified if they heard me streaming because they are very christian

751
02:12:10,480 --> 02:12:12,960
and if they heard me swear I'd feel so bad

752
02:12:17,280 --> 02:12:21,680
if I could tell you the funny shit my my grandparents say because they're so christian

753
02:12:22,720 --> 02:12:23,760
I love them to death though

754
02:12:25,600 --> 02:12:28,800
reminds me of a lady going I've seen people talk about how they used to next to a hot person

755
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:32,880
in an airplane so if I haven't had that her friend thought she doesn't know she's the hot person

756
02:12:32,880 --> 02:12:42,240
oh I hope I'm the hot person flight simulators help you yeah I like I'm not scared of flying

757
02:12:42,240 --> 02:12:46,560
I'm just scared of things out of my control like when I can't control a situation

758
02:12:47,520 --> 02:12:54,800
that it frightens me I prefer safety start one of those prayer circles they just exercise me

759
02:12:57,680 --> 02:13:01,520
how do they feel if they saw a sexy muppet um honestly I don't think they would worry about it

760
02:13:01,520 --> 02:13:05,280
that much because my grandparents really love them up it's like my grandmother especially

761
02:13:05,280 --> 02:13:13,440
I think they have like all the things on like DVD and uh they probably think be like oh this is

762
02:13:13,440 --> 02:13:16,640
like Miss Piggy or something and it has boobs I don't know

763
02:13:20,240 --> 02:13:23,440
man I need to ask you I'm going to the beach soon do you want me to keep my

764
02:13:24,240 --> 02:13:29,280
even in the water no you don't have to wear it if you don't have to wear it in the water

765
02:13:30,240 --> 02:13:35,040
um I'm not if it can you can wear it in the water then that's cool but like again um

766
02:13:36,400 --> 02:13:38,240
I don't want you to like break it or lose it

767
02:13:40,640 --> 02:13:44,640
just know that if you do it like tightly a market leaves this from me

768
02:13:45,520 --> 02:13:49,520
this is why you are dumb don't like to lose the control oh yeah that's a good point

769
02:13:49,520 --> 02:13:54,320
yeah I hate losing control I generally do if I can't control a situation I get very upset

770
02:13:54,320 --> 02:13:59,520
so where am I it's gonna be weird not having she be holding on to my leash

771
02:14:00,080 --> 02:14:05,120
yeah I'm passing the reins over to Strani so she'll be she's she's educated in that

772
02:14:06,400 --> 02:14:12,080
I've already handed over your keys to her uh to your cages so you'll be fine

773
02:14:13,280 --> 02:14:19,120
mercy will also be keeping an eye um on the hair members that are trapped in my cage

774
02:14:19,120 --> 02:14:24,320
because she is also knowledgeable at cages but don't worry you guys will be well loved

775
02:14:24,320 --> 02:14:34,240
and well taken care of make sure mercy feeds you don't worry um yeah I'm gonna miss my cat so much

776
02:14:34,240 --> 02:14:39,600
I remember my every time I see my grandmother she like makes fun of me because the last time I was

777
02:14:39,600 --> 02:14:46,240
there um and this is when I had um Reina and Solea Solea being Reina's sister before she passed away

778
02:14:46,960 --> 02:14:52,880
and I was there so I was I was staying with my grandparents for a month um but I left like

779
02:14:52,880 --> 02:14:58,000
I think like a couple days or a week early because I just miss Reina and Solea so much

780
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:02,640
so it's literally gonna be so hard for me to be away from all my cats it's I don't know

781
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:08,640
I don't know how people do it like often if I could travel with them I would

782
02:15:09,680 --> 02:15:12,640
I think the only cat that would be okay with traveling would be

783
02:15:13,600 --> 02:15:18,480
actually none of them Fia's been kind of scared lately for some reason every time I open the door

784
02:15:18,480 --> 02:15:21,680
she like runs and I'm like did someone like come into my apartment like a maintenance guy when

785
02:15:21,680 --> 02:15:25,040
I wasn't here again and like scare the shit out of my cat like why are she scared every time I open

786
02:15:25,040 --> 02:15:34,720
the door it's really weird um but otherwise I would say I would would have said Fia Reina actually

787
02:15:34,720 --> 02:15:40,000
might chill Reina will just like really hey what's up Reina's doing well she's healing up well I was

788
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:48,720
looking at her but um if I could show you guys the before and after of what her the gash on her

789
02:15:48,720 --> 02:15:56,080
fucking leg looked like um from her anal gland rupturing you guys would be absolutely horrified

790
02:15:56,080 --> 02:16:02,320
because it looked like she got shot right next to her booty cheek um but she it's literally uh

791
02:16:03,120 --> 02:16:07,680
scabbed over now it looks really good she's doing really well she's very I was recording

792
02:16:07,680 --> 02:16:15,200
video this morning of her playing I'll probably post it um she's been yeah she's sleeping on a chair

793
02:16:15,200 --> 02:16:19,200
I'm like turning around um and losing tracking because I'm looking at her she's across the room

794
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:24,800
um and then yeah boomy boomy's you know a menace as per usual nothing you're there

795
02:16:26,080 --> 02:16:30,240
cats are intuitive you know these moving countries are a little more than usual things

796
02:16:30,960 --> 02:16:33,520
happen yeah um

797
02:16:36,640 --> 02:16:40,400
yeah Reina I feel like Reina I'm really worried about Reina because Reina is definitely like

798
02:16:40,400 --> 02:16:47,600
imprinted on me um my voice is cracking a little bit because I'm sad talking about it um so I'm

799
02:16:47,600 --> 02:16:52,800
gonna miss her a lot because she's my cat but thankfully she also loves my mom a lot so but

800
02:16:52,800 --> 02:16:58,320
she sees my mom she's gonna be really happy um she loves hanging out with my mom when my mom came

801
02:16:58,320 --> 02:17:05,760
over last she uh she was like really excited to see her and it was it's funny how you like is my

802
02:17:05,760 --> 02:17:14,160
she hadn't seen Reina in like probably a couple months like quite like six months and my mom's

803
02:17:14,160 --> 02:17:18,160
like she's forgotten me and I'm like no she hasn't I've had her since she was a kid and she knows

804
02:17:18,160 --> 02:17:24,720
anywhere um but yeah she's really great she's healing my grandparents have pets no my grandparents

805
02:17:24,720 --> 02:17:29,200
have never had pets because they're the type of people that think animals are meant to be outside

806
02:17:29,200 --> 02:17:36,960
at all times um that was funny the first time my grandpa so these are my Haitian grandparents

807
02:17:37,600 --> 02:17:43,840
um so they they also have you know that that they have like Haitian accents um

808
02:17:45,600 --> 02:17:53,440
like my grandfather almost like it's more like a french accent and uh so back like I remember

809
02:17:53,440 --> 02:17:58,960
a couple years ago when my grandparents first saw Reina Reina used to be a really fat cat unless

810
02:17:58,960 --> 02:18:03,200
until she recently lost a lot of weight because of her age and she just can't like she used to be

811
02:18:03,200 --> 02:18:08,960
like like 17 pounds I'm not even kidding you we I will post pictures of when she was very large

812
02:18:11,120 --> 02:18:17,280
and so my grandfather saw her the first time she like walked out from like uh this is when I

813
02:18:17,280 --> 02:18:22,320
lived at my parents house and then she walked out from like behind a wall or something and my

814
02:18:22,320 --> 02:18:28,960
grandfather goes oh look at her she is pregnant wow she's what a beautiful cat you're gonna have

815
02:18:28,960 --> 02:18:39,920
beautiful kittens and I'm like poppy no she's not pregnant she's not pregnant

816
02:18:43,360 --> 02:18:48,000
yeah Reina was a thicker I still thick um I used to I used to I used to call her Miss Chonk

817
02:18:48,560 --> 02:18:52,240
she'll she'll always be fat to me even though she's like normal cat size now

818
02:18:52,960 --> 02:19:01,200
yeah he definitely fat shamed her um but yeah I haven't even told my grandparents like I quit

819
02:19:01,200 --> 02:19:06,960
my job yet so it's gonna be kind of awkward having that conversation my grandfather texted me yesterday

820
02:19:06,960 --> 02:19:13,600
he's like hey how's it going I can't wait blah blah blah and I'm just like it's going great I can't

821
02:19:13,600 --> 02:19:23,680
wait to see you soon because I know I like they are they're very traditional um

822
02:19:25,360 --> 02:19:29,920
like I know they were kind of upset that I didn't go to college because my grandfather was gonna

823
02:19:29,920 --> 02:19:35,200
pay for my college until but then I went a little um I took a gap year and then he didn't but yeah

824
02:19:35,200 --> 02:19:40,880
it's a whole fake thing um they don't know what I do now only my parents do and some and like two

825
02:19:40,880 --> 02:19:47,120
my two best friends all of in Salem have you guys uh I've mentioned to you often um my grandparents

826
02:19:47,120 --> 02:19:55,360
don't know my former employer knows because I was just like yeah fuck you guys I'm gonna go be a big

827
02:19:55,360 --> 02:20:05,520
streamer no I didn't say that uh they don't have old country value oh yeah um it's like boy or

828
02:20:05,520 --> 02:20:10,960
kettlebell that's cute yeah the oh they only want I never take it personally they only ever want

829
02:20:11,600 --> 02:20:17,920
what's best for me um if I told them anything that I did they'd probably be absolutely mortified

830
02:20:19,440 --> 02:20:26,720
I'd be like she's living in sin um yeah they won't be I'll probably skirt around the topic and be

831
02:20:26,720 --> 02:20:30,560
like oh you know like because I remember when I tweeted that tweet like oh what do I tell people

832
02:20:31,280 --> 02:20:39,680
that I do I'm just gonna be like I uh work for a startup social media company but I'm under

833
02:20:39,680 --> 02:20:44,720
NDA so I can't say anything and then they'll be like oh okay and I rather they won't like they

834
02:20:44,720 --> 02:20:54,000
won't usually when I'm there I make them talk a lot so uh probably Morgan

835
02:20:54,160 --> 02:21:04,560
okay I'll tell you one funny thing that my grandfather has said

836
02:21:06,160 --> 02:21:13,120
so my grandparents were here last they um they came why did they come for did I think

837
02:21:13,120 --> 02:21:17,200
they did they come from like one of my parents anniversaries or something and my mom flew

838
02:21:17,200 --> 02:21:22,480
them up as a surprise I think I think so I can't remember so I'm going and my grandparents were

839
02:21:22,560 --> 02:21:29,440
staying um with my with my family for about like a week week and a half or two weeks I can't really

840
02:21:29,440 --> 02:21:34,320
remember and so my grandfather's like oh I want to go get some and my grandfather's the type he's

841
02:21:34,320 --> 02:21:39,200
always like wear slacks he's always was like wearing a polo he's very well-dressed man he used to be

842
02:21:39,200 --> 02:21:49,760
a Spanish teacher in Haiti and um he uh so we're looking for pants for him and with my grandmother

843
02:21:49,760 --> 02:21:57,440
just me him and my grandmother and he's just like looking at all these like slacks and he's like

844
02:21:58,080 --> 02:22:04,560
why are all these pants so skinny what they're what is this these cockscrew pants they're

845
02:22:04,560 --> 02:22:13,520
trying to look at my back sides I cannot believe them it is the homosexuals they want to see my

846
02:22:13,520 --> 02:22:20,400
back sides and they want to grab my back side I'm like poppy no I don't think I don't think the

847
02:22:20,400 --> 02:22:31,120
gays want anything to do with you he's like you never know you never know what they want I'm like

848
02:22:31,120 --> 02:22:37,360
poppy please remind you like my my my grandparents don't know also that I'm pansexual either I'm not

849
02:22:37,360 --> 02:22:42,400
there's no need to tell like that's this person to me I don't they don't know but I think I think

850
02:22:42,480 --> 02:22:46,640
it would be very funny if I was just like I said right there and then I'm like you know

851
02:22:48,960 --> 02:22:50,720
it would have been funny yeah you like my accent

852
02:22:53,280 --> 02:22:58,000
yeah I'm like I don't think nobody wants to look and it's like and this and this happened later

853
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:01,680
because we went shopping and he brought it up later to my parents because my parents asked him

854
02:23:01,680 --> 02:23:05,280
when we had a lot of other family over because like my family's all over the place and we all

855
02:23:05,280 --> 02:23:10,720
like came to my parents house and and like my parents family friends from their church and stuff

856
02:23:11,600 --> 02:23:17,360
and my grandfather is telling the story of this really short pants that's really tight

857
02:23:17,920 --> 02:23:21,840
skinny pants like skinny jeans and stuff and like skinnier slacks like they're really like

858
02:23:22,960 --> 02:23:27,360
whatever I don't really know how what they're called um and he's telling it to the group

859
02:23:27,360 --> 02:23:32,880
as we're like at my parents house around the fire and my mom is just looking mortified

860
02:23:33,520 --> 02:23:38,400
she's trying not to laugh so hard because like my parents my parents don't like my parents a lot

861
02:23:38,400 --> 02:23:46,640
more lax but my grandparents are hardcore like values like traditional uh biblical values my

862
02:23:46,640 --> 02:23:53,200
parents a little bit more lax so my mom is just like like redacted redacted it's fine don't worry

863
02:23:53,200 --> 02:23:58,800
about it like you did I hope you found better pants anyways is anybody you want some uh potato

864
02:23:58,800 --> 02:24:00,160
salad is anybody

865
02:24:07,280 --> 02:24:11,360
I think my family has gotten worse this time to be these last liver when I was a kid

866
02:24:12,400 --> 02:24:16,080
oh I just take yeah my parents were a lot more conservative and now they just like really don't

867
02:24:16,080 --> 02:24:22,960
give a shit anymore um I don't really care either way I just I don't have the energy to hate

868
02:24:23,920 --> 02:24:26,800
that's not my problem I don't care um

869
02:24:29,120 --> 02:24:32,160
that's my grandparents my parents are chill my parents are chill

870
02:24:33,840 --> 02:24:38,160
my parents are very chill um they kind of just do their own thing

871
02:24:40,160 --> 02:24:45,520
my mom is the type of uh Christian woman where she

872
02:24:47,920 --> 02:24:50,560
she says oh as long as nobody's hurting anyone

873
02:24:51,440 --> 02:24:53,520
and people are just showing each other with love and respect

874
02:24:55,280 --> 02:24:57,120
um that's all she could ever ask for

875
02:25:00,720 --> 02:25:05,200
hating is too much effort for nothing exactly I just don't I just don't have the energy

876
02:25:05,840 --> 02:25:11,120
even like people like really disagree with me or like have a totally different world view I'm

877
02:25:11,120 --> 02:25:17,040
just like I don't care speaking of which if you don't follow my alt twitter I said to read

878
02:25:17,040 --> 02:25:21,200
and this is why I have this mindset is because of this book I read the four agreements um

879
02:25:22,640 --> 02:25:28,400
because I sometimes I get I used to get so caught up with what people thought of me

880
02:25:29,040 --> 02:25:36,240
and how they spoke to me and how they did this this and that and like that book helped me so much

881
02:25:36,240 --> 02:25:40,080
I highly recommend it um and it's it's written in such a

882
02:25:40,240 --> 02:25:47,200
like lazy way that it's like it sounds like you're just talking to someone and they're just like

883
02:25:47,920 --> 02:25:52,720
you know like you got to stop assuming stuff about people because when you assume it becomes

884
02:25:52,720 --> 02:25:58,560
miscommunications and like it's just it's just really funny how it's written um but I believe

885
02:25:58,560 --> 02:26:02,320
it's only like eight bucks off amazon it's a very good book

886
02:26:02,320 --> 02:26:11,920
I love doing that I like go XLRs like lit up very oddly whatever um

887
02:26:14,320 --> 02:26:20,480
but yeah yeah yeah it's a good book I remember and I'm not you know afraid to say this um when I

888
02:26:20,480 --> 02:26:29,440
was younger I was hospitalized because mental Illinois and um uh they had like flash cards of

889
02:26:29,440 --> 02:26:35,040
that and then and I always I always liked because they're like kind of just like affirmations you

890
02:26:35,040 --> 02:26:40,800
would say and just like what you could think about um to like kind of like improve and stuff

891
02:26:41,600 --> 02:26:45,760
and then when I left in like years and years and years had passed and I could never remember

892
02:26:45,760 --> 02:26:50,080
what it was called and then I walked into this random ass store and I saw the book and I was like

893
02:26:50,080 --> 02:26:57,120
holy shit and I immediately bought it and it's just it's just a good book when I was my young boy

894
02:26:58,080 --> 02:27:01,680
yeah it's just like uh I'm not usually like a self-help book person I think that's kind of

895
02:27:01,680 --> 02:27:07,440
bullshit but I gave it a try and I liked it um my mom's very much a self-help book person

896
02:27:09,360 --> 02:27:12,240
but I love that about her because then she always gives me good advice I'm like you can

897
02:27:12,240 --> 02:27:17,840
consume it and then you can just give it back to me in a easier to digest format um

898
02:27:17,840 --> 02:27:28,240
um I hate Illinois yeah I was like super young now I don't know what the fuck was going on um

899
02:27:28,240 --> 02:27:33,440
the subtle ardent oh yeah I think my mom has that book because my mom if I could show you just like

900
02:27:33,440 --> 02:27:42,000
that stack of books my mom has about self-help and nutrition because my mom loves good nutrition

901
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,480
um

902
02:27:47,920 --> 02:27:53,360
metallic Illinois yeah normally all everybody has a little dash in metallic in Illinois um

903
02:27:54,160 --> 02:27:58,320
yeah I always I'll always recommend you guys books that I think will help you or think that you

904
02:27:58,320 --> 02:28:04,480
might enjoy or I'll tell you if I think they're like silly like oh read this smut book just like

905
02:28:04,480 --> 02:28:12,640
how um how emi does uh I don't know mercy does mercy read I don't know I I know she reads I'm

906
02:28:12,640 --> 02:28:18,240
just wondering if she reads that type of book I can't recall I think she does make a little book club

907
02:28:20,800 --> 02:28:25,920
I know strongy reads a lot uh a lot of I can't remember if she reads all like nonfiction which

908
02:28:25,920 --> 02:28:30,720
surprised me because she like really loves lord of the rings I like how I'm talking about mercy

909
02:28:30,720 --> 02:28:36,640
and then right on my screen something she just says she tweeted something called just saying yes

910
02:28:36,640 --> 02:28:44,000
and that kind of freaked me out it was like she was talking to me um because I have everyone's

911
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:52,240
notifications turned on for all the girls um I'm looking forward to more recommendations yeah yeah

912
02:28:52,240 --> 02:28:57,840
I don't I'll probably yeah she likes this deck yeah she likes thrillers she likes thrillers she's in

913
02:28:57,840 --> 02:29:05,840
the walls um and I read a lot of high fantasy so I might uh I haven't read any thing in a while I'm

914
02:29:05,840 --> 02:29:11,280
reading that book um feather so vicious that emi recommended when she first tweeted about it

915
02:29:12,240 --> 02:29:16,080
because I like bullied her into telling me I was like what she's like I don't know if you can handle

916
02:29:16,080 --> 02:29:26,000
this I'm like girl I read cadence by Colleen Hoover and that is a that's that's a book for the

917
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:32,640
pin pals right there if I have any pin pals in the chat read cadence um all I'm gonna say is

918
02:29:35,120 --> 02:29:36,160
cousins and an uncle

919
02:29:39,520 --> 02:29:45,200
Lord Colleen Hoover is a menace fact I like Verity oh I think I might recommend Verity

920
02:29:45,760 --> 02:29:50,960
to no she's like she's not she's not a super good author I'm not even I'm not saying she's a good

921
02:29:50,960 --> 02:29:57,440
author by the way she I'm not saying that it's like if you just want to like read something silly

922
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:07,120
calling Hoover Hoover Hoover whatever the frick her name is is your girl um I think she would

923
02:30:07,120 --> 02:30:12,400
like I think Mercy would like Verity because it is a mystery it's like a what happened to this man's

924
02:30:12,400 --> 02:30:18,240
wife is the main character going crazy who I should also recommend the silent patient to Mercy but

925
02:30:18,240 --> 02:30:23,200
I bet she's already read that I love I love recommending books to people it's one of my favorites

926
02:30:24,640 --> 02:30:32,160
oh I feel like fantasy I read it was the speaker spear wielder trilogy oh I've never heard of that

927
02:30:33,520 --> 02:30:39,280
my dad has been harassing me to read the third binding which is pretty much literally

928
02:30:41,680 --> 02:30:47,680
the king killer chronicles in a different font um I like for I read like an audio I listened to

929
02:30:47,680 --> 02:30:52,480
the audiobook for the first two chapters and I hated the audiobook reader that I just stopped

930
02:30:52,480 --> 02:31:00,480
reading it um I think it's so funny when this person says hey they're beautiful babe and then

931
02:31:00,480 --> 02:31:09,040
people in the chat respond to it okay you're all beautiful babes I just I've always thought that

932
02:31:09,040 --> 02:31:13,360
was funny when that happened a book recommendation would be right before your vacay kind of a book

933
02:31:13,440 --> 02:31:17,680
report stream after your vacay no I would be traumatized never say book report to me again oh

934
02:31:17,680 --> 02:31:22,880
my god this shit I had to go through because it's funny I like to read a lot but I hated doing

935
02:31:23,600 --> 02:31:29,520
what was assigned to me during school for book reports and stuff it was my least favorite thing

936
02:31:29,520 --> 02:31:35,520
and like but I ended up like in hindsight I wish I had kind of focused more in the classics because

937
02:31:35,520 --> 02:31:39,520
you know you read like Huckbury Finn while that shit and like Catcher in the Rye I kind of want

938

to go back and try to read those books again um because I didn't really I kind of just sped read

939
02:31:43,920 --> 02:31:52,480

940
02:31:52,480 --> 02:31:58,320
if you guys can tell me what to do that's funny that you think you can do that it's very cute um

941
02:31:59,440 --> 02:32:05,440
but I liked I like don't get me wrong I liked English class when I could write any sort of

942
02:32:05,440 --> 02:32:09,840
fiction that's why I really love my creative writing class um

943
02:32:14,400 --> 02:32:18,960
I'm I just thought I was I'm debating whether or not to try to find my old email or I save stuff

944
02:32:20,240 --> 02:32:24,720
and do a quick dramatic reading for you of one of my old post-by-post role plays

945
02:32:28,080 --> 02:32:28,880
actually I kind of want to

946
02:32:28,880 --> 02:32:30,880
uh

947
02:32:33,680 --> 02:32:36,880

948
02:32:58,880 --> 02:33:08,880
um

949
02:33:17,120 --> 02:33:21,440
my cats love to scare me by going under the bed and jumping out at my feet

950
02:33:22,400 --> 02:33:24,320
they are the monsters under my bed as my cats

951
02:33:24,480 --> 02:33:32,480
they say when you pass on a new best old judge your old role play logs

952
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:37,040
sometimes they speak to your stupid questions it's not as up what does it mean I don't know

953
02:33:37,040 --> 02:33:38,160
it's fucking morning bro

954
02:33:40,640 --> 02:33:42,160
facts

955
02:33:47,280 --> 02:33:48,560
I am plugged in

956
02:33:49,360 --> 02:33:54,400
I don't care about voice messages what is happening

957
02:33:58,560 --> 02:34:00,880
it's like automatically open twitter um

958
02:34:03,360 --> 02:34:06,880
where is my email I have to it'll take me a moment to search

959
02:34:12,560 --> 02:34:16,800
oh wait did someone someone don't know earlier by the way I thought I heard something but I

960
02:34:16,800 --> 02:34:20,560
couldn't tell if it was the game or not let me look to see if we got any donos or stupas

961
02:34:21,440 --> 02:34:22,640
thank you if you did by the way

962
02:34:31,760 --> 02:34:32,800
nope okay cool

963
02:34:42,800 --> 02:34:46,560
math can't be English and English is a math in terms of many right answers yeah there's

964
02:34:46,640 --> 02:34:47,040
always

965
02:34:50,400 --> 02:34:58,480
yeah math is more absolute uh I preferred English because it was you could be very ambiguous

966
02:34:58,480 --> 02:35:01,040
because I'm very much like a dreamer type person

967
02:35:02,560 --> 02:35:03,600
let me take the headphones off

968
02:35:08,640 --> 02:35:14,560
okay let me see let me see if I just type in creative writing if anything pops up

969
02:35:17,120 --> 02:35:17,620
okay

970
02:35:23,280 --> 02:35:24,400
oh yep

971
02:35:27,520 --> 02:35:29,840
what the fuck is about what is this

972
02:35:35,680 --> 02:35:39,760
oh I remember I wrote about like a serial killer really briefly

973
02:35:47,440 --> 02:35:53,680
okay I wrote this when I was like 17 you guys want to hear it

974
02:35:56,240 --> 02:35:57,200
you guys want to hear it

975
02:36:06,480 --> 02:36:09,600
oh my god hi rena she just like hopped on my lap as I was about to start

976
02:36:13,040 --> 02:36:13,840
teenage writing

977
02:36:16,720 --> 02:36:23,120
I'm gonna read this in a British accent

978
02:36:27,040 --> 02:36:33,840
I hadn't meant to do it but now I have to deal with the fact that there is a dead body in

979
02:36:33,840 --> 02:36:40,480
the waiting room if anyone comes in I'm screwed completely absolutely ultimately screwed

980
02:36:41,600 --> 02:36:45,600
this is terrible I was just going to enjoy myself this week no slip-ups

981
02:36:46,160 --> 02:36:51,120
I was going to be normal no senseless killing I had found so much for that

982
02:36:52,880 --> 02:36:56,400
my head jerks to the side as I hear shoes scuffle on the tile floors and feet away

983
02:36:57,040 --> 02:37:01,440
that's not good I'm running out of time my eyes glance around the cliche waiting room

984
02:37:01,440 --> 02:37:05,360
a room dappled with dying house plants and pictures of smiling children they're equally

985
02:37:05,360 --> 02:37:11,120
happy parents oh look over there that one's a puppy I cock my head and smile blissfully at

986
02:37:11,120 --> 02:37:16,960
the splatter of scarlet that had found its way to the framed picture my smile wavered as a nurse

987
02:37:16,960 --> 02:37:21,840
entered the waiting area quicker than I anticipated a clipboard in hand she was still unaware of the

988
02:37:21,840 --> 02:37:29,920
fellow lying motionless on the floor in a monotone voice called out Mr. Halliday weekend I'm sorry I

989
02:37:29,920 --> 02:37:36,160
have to cut you off there I'll spare you the gory details but she did fall voicelessly to the floor

990
02:37:36,160 --> 02:37:43,040
with uh maybe a pen in her neck if she was lucky enough to survive it no doubt the seizure she's

991
02:37:43,040 --> 02:37:46,320
having would render the brain damage she wouldn't remember me anytime soon

992
02:37:49,680 --> 02:37:54,160
my ring is licking my hand and I'm trying to read what are you doing lady can you sit down

993
02:37:56,720 --> 02:38:03,520
um I straightened my suit jacket also read for occasions such as these inside the clipboard

994
02:38:03,600 --> 02:38:08,000
was covered in the nurse's blood but I could clearly still see one of my aliases in thick

995
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:14,080
black ink more in Halliday I like the name very much and it frustrated me now that I would have

996
02:38:14,080 --> 02:38:18,560
to scrap it and get it yet another one false identities weren't particularly cheap these

997
02:38:18,560 --> 02:38:24,240
days either and thinking of this caused a scowl to cross my face speaking of which I should probably

998
02:38:24,240 --> 02:38:30,320
take care of my face I like how I switched from British to normal it's fine no doubt it was flecked

999
02:38:30,320 --> 02:38:35,280
in my favorite color I walked hastily to the nearby bathroom the smell of sterility somewhat

1000
02:38:35,280 --> 02:38:41,200
dizzying even for a person like myself one who enjoys cleanliness in order ironically with a

1001
02:38:41,200 --> 02:38:45,520
quick gesture I opened the door and looked in the mirror and the same hazel oh see we're gonna get into

1002
02:38:45,520 --> 02:38:54,640
the uh the description part by the same hazel eyes same dark brown hair the same clean shaven face

1003
02:38:55,280 --> 02:39:00,400
even the blood dotted across it was a comforting familiarity my hand promptly reached for the

1004
02:39:00,400 --> 02:39:05,440
soap while its companion slumped simultaneously turned on the water and I scrubbed earnestly

1005
02:39:05,440 --> 02:39:10,400
thinking over my options what could I do with the two bodies bleeding out before someone will

1006
02:39:10,400 --> 02:39:14,320
check back eventually and I need at least 20 minutes to get my supplies in one hour to clean

1007
02:39:14,320 --> 02:39:19,360
everything up in another two hours to destroy your heart the bodies my lips form a thin line

1008
02:39:19,360 --> 02:39:25,520
want to stare into the mirror a little longer and think back I pictured the room more specifically

1009
02:39:25,520 --> 02:39:32,080
the corners thankfully I didn't remember any cameras I really have to have to have to take time

1010
02:39:32,080 --> 02:39:37,440
to erase video files and probably kill a security guard I knew DNA wasn't a problem anymore for me

1011
02:39:37,440 --> 02:39:43,200
I had to get to match it to a face as plain as mine I didn't have any memorable scars on my face

1012
02:39:43,200 --> 02:39:49,600
only my body but that's another story again I didn't I probably watched like one true crime

1013
02:39:49,600 --> 02:40:00,400
episode before I broke this um let me get us to the audiobook series um I rubbed my hands vigorously

1014
02:40:00,400 --> 02:40:05,360
with an absurd amount of paper towels before sorry this is really small font so sorry me to read

1015
02:40:05,360 --> 02:40:09,680
we're shoving them in a fatally small trash can and letting myself out of the bathroom

1016
02:40:10,640 --> 02:40:13,760
my head peeked around a few corners and it looks like no one had come through yet

1017
02:40:14,400 --> 02:40:18,000
I stood in the doorway of the waiting room checking my person for any signs that I had

1018
02:40:18,720 --> 02:40:23,120
dispatched people and found nothing incriminating besides something I could blame on a nosebleed

1019
02:40:25,040 --> 02:40:28,400
excuse me but the satisfied nod I opened the door to leave the

1020
02:40:28,400 --> 02:40:31,360
waiting room completely with a sort of flourish and fed it away

1021
02:40:31,840 --> 02:40:42,320
you're probably wondering who I am thinking why would someone sorry why would a person commit

1022
02:40:42,320 --> 02:40:49,680
something so morbid may I plead insanity not that I've ever said that none of us hello nice to

1023
02:40:49,680 --> 02:40:55,680
meet you my name is Nolan Nolan Aristar you've probably heard of me why the f*** I'm so f***ing

1024
02:40:55,760 --> 02:40:56,480
pretentious

1025
02:41:02,400 --> 02:41:09,360
I'm like reading this and I feel like I sound like um Heisenberg from f***ing village

1026
02:41:10,240 --> 02:41:13,200
oh also called the piercer

1027
02:41:14,880 --> 02:41:17,360
well I'm cementing the venom from my immortal

1028
02:41:17,440 --> 02:41:25,760
oh it's funny I wrote this before I was diagnosed with OCD you'll see why

1029
02:41:33,120 --> 02:41:37,200
pardon me also called the piercer pretty nifty if I do say myself giving my

1030
02:41:37,200 --> 02:41:41,600
given my middle name is pierce but I don't think the cops who christened me knew that

1031
02:41:42,320 --> 02:41:45,840
anyways drifting from the original topic you're wondering why I've done this but

1032
02:41:45,840 --> 02:41:49,680
sincerely sincerely I cannot tell you I tell you I cannot help it

1033
02:41:50,240 --> 02:41:58,240
you see I like the color red very much blood is clearly red in its purest form and I need

1034
02:41:58,240 --> 02:42:05,120
no eye crave to look at it touch and feel it this is all thanks to my obsessive compulsive

1035
02:42:05,120 --> 02:42:11,040
disorder commonly known as the abbreviation OCD this is nothing to do with OCD but it's funny

1036
02:42:11,040 --> 02:42:17,680
that I wrote this I'd like to stop I really would but red is just really my favorite color

1037
02:42:18,480 --> 02:42:25,360
it calms me it's beautiful I won't say it's art because that's so typical I strange myself from

1038
02:42:25,360 --> 02:42:33,040
other killers because honestly the majority of them kill for art corpses aren't majestical masterpieces

1039
02:42:33,040 --> 02:42:37,920
the human body's disgusting thing when twisted and deformed and truly when it's normal and you

1040
02:42:37,920 --> 02:42:42,960
rot on the inside from corruption or some other adjective that's more poetic

1041
02:42:45,120 --> 02:42:46,160
I'm not the OCD

1042
02:42:48,480 --> 02:42:53,360
I'll cringe from time to time at my handiwork I'll get carried away lose myself and be very

1043
02:42:53,360 --> 02:42:58,160
mad afterwards people need to understand how inconvenient killing a person is it's a time

1044
02:42:58,160 --> 02:43:05,120
consuming and it's time I can't read my own fucking email and obviously you would get into

1045
02:43:05,120 --> 02:43:11,280
a lot of trouble I have to take time out of my day to come and end your life which probably isn't

1046
02:43:11,280 --> 02:43:17,040
all rainbows and sunshine and such a place is this you're welcome you selfish prick heart sign

1047
02:43:17,040 --> 02:43:22,800
smiley face enough of me and my terrible explaining skills I just felt in the need to justify myself

1048
02:43:22,800 --> 02:43:29,760
all right all right I literally wrote heart sign smiley face by the way

1049
02:43:29,760 --> 02:43:37,680
I tossed my suit there's like like two more paragraphs I tossed my suit jacket

1050
02:43:37,680 --> 02:43:42,800
on the couch when I entered my modest and modern apartment I'm pretty sure this inspired by like

1051
02:43:42,800 --> 02:43:48,800
um it was inspired by like some true crime thing that I watched it was inspired by

1052
02:43:48,800 --> 02:43:54,960
Marceline from Adventure Time because how she drinks the color red and I think it was

1053
02:43:55,280 --> 02:43:58,480
inspired by like American Psycho

1054
02:44:01,520 --> 02:44:09,920
like all those uh I also was just very aggressive person when I was younger um

1055
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:16,560
everything was just as I liked it monochrome with splashes of red I like how my that's kind

1056
02:44:16,560 --> 02:44:22,960
of how my outfit is um it's monochrome with splashes of red bro I was I predicting my own

1057
02:44:22,960 --> 02:44:27,600
am I gonna kill no I'm kidding um the only colors I can tolerate besides red are the

1058
02:44:27,600 --> 02:44:32,720
usual black and white colors that I am indifferent to only apples lay in the bowl on the island in

1059
02:44:32,720 --> 02:44:37,440
the kitchen only tomatoes were in a jar on the counter besides the sink not that everything I

1060
02:44:37,440 --> 02:44:43,200
eat is red that would be probably unhealthy and ridiculous I do have my limitations however you'll

1061
02:44:43,200 --> 02:44:50,800
find nothing orange ever anywhere in here never orange is an unsightly color that should just

1062
02:44:51,520 --> 02:44:58,560
go home it tries too hard to be red I don't know how some people enjoy orange juice too really

1063
02:45:01,600 --> 02:45:08,960
orange is an unsightly thing I know uh yeah I actually I do hate the color orange

1064
02:45:13,120 --> 02:45:14,800
orange is my least favorite color

1065
02:45:15,760 --> 02:45:21,360
so I threw some shots at orange right now but I do love orange juice so that's a lie

1066
02:45:23,920 --> 02:45:28,880
uh I do a little jig as I head toward the bathroom peeling off clothes as I near it

1067
02:45:28,880 --> 02:45:32,880
when I reach the shower I'm already completely undressed feverishly rubbing away the sense of

1068
02:45:32,880 --> 02:45:37,680
metal with some cinnamon soap cinnamon masks anything I'll tell you that right now I turn

1069
02:45:37,680 --> 02:45:42,480
my head slightly as I hear a thump somewhere from within the house confused I shut off the water

1070
02:45:42,480 --> 02:45:47,040
and toweled myself off before stepping out of the shower I'm not an idiot and I don't call out

1071
02:45:47,040 --> 02:45:51,600
who's there like a stereotypical girl in a horror movie but wrap the towel around my waist

1072
02:45:52,400 --> 02:45:56,800
wait already like oh no I didn't I just toweled myself well he toweled himself off

1073
02:45:58,400 --> 02:46:02,880
uh and wait for the sound to occur again and soon enough a moment later it does

1074
02:46:02,880 --> 02:46:06,320
I sigh with relief as it's not coming from within my apartment but outside the door

1075
02:46:06,960 --> 02:46:10,000
someone's knocking feel there she's this one

1076
02:46:11,600 --> 02:46:15,120
the memsie is this story so Dracula's kill who's that

1077
02:46:17,360 --> 02:46:23,200
Amy hate what do you mean Amy hate confirm is she like orange she's a ginger I don't

1078
02:46:23,200 --> 02:46:28,000
know this only applies to like the color like if it's on like it doesn't apply to ginger hair

1079
02:46:28,640 --> 02:46:32,240
because on Emmys I've already said Emmys model is my favorite out of everyone's

1080
02:46:32,720 --> 02:46:37,600
and then it goes like mercy me

1081
02:46:40,640 --> 02:46:44,800
actually no that's hard it'd be hard to rank all the girls models

1082
02:46:47,040 --> 02:46:50,480
and me mercy me

1083
02:46:52,480 --> 02:46:57,920
fuck because I genuinely like I like mercies and strongies even evenly um hold on

1084
02:46:57,920 --> 02:47:07,920
I didn't put the connection together

1085
02:47:13,200 --> 02:47:17,840
I meander down the Honeiro hallway somewhat lazily and finally peer through the people

1086
02:47:17,840 --> 02:47:25,120
just my like my luck my like on the other side it's not like I have I wrote this in great grammar

1087
02:47:25,120 --> 02:47:30,240
I just can't read right now on the other side is an eye trying to look through causing me to

1088
02:47:30,240 --> 02:47:36,720
flinch back when I look again very cautiously I see the smug look of a grizzly grizzly looking cop

1089
02:47:36,720 --> 02:47:41,040
he's leaning forward to knock again before I can swiftly unlock and open the door

1090
02:47:42,240 --> 02:47:46,720
before he can I swiftly unlock and open the door letting the cop swing at an open air then

1091
02:47:46,720 --> 02:47:53,280
smack me in the chest just what I wanted I let out a small squeal hey I just opened the door

1092
02:47:53,360 --> 02:48:00,480
might you hit me the cop was clearly flustered after this hitting a groan very fit I might add

1093
02:48:00,480 --> 02:48:06,960
man in a towel and took a step back oh or accident sir sorry about that this won't take long I'm

1094
02:48:06,960 --> 02:48:12,160
just here to ask a few questions he looked down at his shoes and pulled out a notepad and flipped

1095
02:48:12,160 --> 02:48:17,440
a few pages I knew it wouldn't take much to make this guy go away but still this had to be the fastest

1096
02:48:17,440 --> 02:48:21,920
time they spread word about clint killings it's been at least an hour and they've already brought

1097
02:48:21,920 --> 02:48:29,040
their search radius to my house wincing at this I leaned against the doorway trying trying

1098
02:48:32,640 --> 02:48:40,000
oh trying to look as huffy yet sexy as possible fire away pardon the pun I smiled widely pretending

1099
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:46,320
to be happy the man was there my eagerness was an easy repellent uh well are you aware that they

1100
02:48:46,320 --> 02:48:56,800
have been dual killings in the area and that's it that's how it ends I remember my classmates

1101
02:48:56,800 --> 02:49:02,960
were like what for what happens next didn't his he just ultra instinct the door open fast enough

1102
02:49:02,960 --> 02:49:07,680
to get knocked in the chest well I guess if you like linger and you're like lingering your hand

1103
02:49:07,680 --> 02:49:14,720
they just opens it and just fucking knocks them yeah the cliffhanger let me see let me see creative

1104
02:49:14,720 --> 02:49:18,720
writing did you do

1105
02:49:19,440 --> 02:49:31,760
am I have to go like all the way back

1106
02:49:31,840 --> 02:49:34,800
so

1107
02:49:41,920 --> 02:49:44,800
the fuck was I writing Jesus Christ

1108
02:49:57,040 --> 02:49:58,800
what the fuck is this

1109
02:50:02,240 --> 02:50:10,800
oh this is some of my OCs

1110
02:50:18,720 --> 02:50:27,360
interesting sorry this is like I don't remember writing this I'm not reading that no

1111
02:50:27,600 --> 02:50:30,880
I don't want you guys to figure out how crazy I am

1112
02:50:35,680 --> 02:50:41,920
is that like again when I said when I joked and said that no it's not it's not one of those

1113
02:50:41,920 --> 02:50:43,760
it's wait is it one of those I didn't really

1114
02:50:48,640 --> 02:50:49,200
it was like

1115
02:50:50,160 --> 02:50:56,320
again as an only child I didn't have any fucking friends okay

1116
02:51:01,040 --> 02:51:04,960
what if you compared my creative writing to my immortal well look at

1117
02:51:04,960 --> 02:51:09,760
what I just read to you and then what I've read in my immortal it is not the same

1118
02:51:11,040 --> 02:51:16,640
peer pressure or so the wolf roleplay tweet I was trying to find the wolf roleplay one

1119
02:51:16,640 --> 02:51:20,160
because I remember I did like a dramatic writing of my character's death

1120
02:51:20,160 --> 02:51:24,960
and I love roleplay I don't know where that is though it's not showing up

1121
02:51:29,520 --> 02:51:31,760
I love how I left notes in the

1122
02:51:31,760 --> 02:51:48,080
like I like a couple years ago more than a couple years ago like like two decades ago

1123
02:51:48,080 --> 02:51:56,000
back when I was like 30 um I wrote like notes of like I must have reread it after like a year

1124
02:51:56,000 --> 02:51:58,640
and then a year after that and I was just like what the fuck is wrong with me

1125
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:06,800
yeah my morals my my my magnum opus

1126
02:52:11,440 --> 02:52:16,320
my morals are really scary I mean a lot of it showed up for the kj somewhere

1127
02:52:16,320 --> 02:52:20,160
yesterday I think we're somewhere but no like like I was very

1128
02:52:20,720 --> 02:52:26,080
like it isn't bad like it honestly it's a normal totally normal

1129
02:52:27,360 --> 02:52:32,560
like I wrote like a chapter of something but it's the context behind it which makes me embarrassed

1130
02:52:33,680 --> 02:52:40,720
because I wrote like I have this I've told you guys I lose to dream a lot right in fact I lose to

1131
02:52:40,720 --> 02:52:46,000
dreams um when I woke up from my nap I was losing dreaming it was really weird um

1132
02:52:46,160 --> 02:52:56,240
dreams have always been really weird for me because for me when I lose to dream I usually

1133
02:52:56,240 --> 02:53:06,080
visualize a place and then there's like a hub after I lose to dream and it's I always end

1134
02:53:06,080 --> 02:53:11,520
up there there's always like a hub and then I can like I sound so it sounds fucking crazy

1135
02:53:11,520 --> 02:53:19,280
saying it out loud because it is it's just weird weird mind shit um but then I can go to like there's

1136
02:53:19,280 --> 02:53:29,920
always like there's always places in my dreams that are like always constant is how I can

1137
02:53:31,600 --> 02:53:37,520
say it like I don't like there's always like there's um there's I usually just call it like the hub

1138
02:53:37,520 --> 02:53:41,520
which is like all the places you can go to and it's like usually there's like a pool

1139
02:53:42,960 --> 02:53:46,880
you go into and I call it the gate and then there's this place called the train tracks because

1140
02:53:46,880 --> 02:53:50,000
there's this train tracks and then there was the mall and it was like there's a banded mall

1141
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:54,320
whoop I just smacked my microphone and then there was like weirdly like my grandparents house

1142
02:53:55,280 --> 02:53:59,120
my other grandparents house my mom's there and there's like a bunch of other places and there

1143
02:53:59,120 --> 02:54:05,760
were there were always constant in my dreams um so I would go from place to place and I would

1144
02:54:05,760 --> 02:54:12,080
find other places to add to like the hub very weird I don't know why my dreams do that like this

1145
02:54:12,080 --> 02:54:19,040
the dream that I woke up from today um because I hadn't lucid dreamed in a very long time uh

1146
02:54:21,040 --> 02:54:28,640
it was like I remember being outside my body and just or I'm usually I'm usually I've already said

1147
02:54:28,640 --> 02:54:32,720
this before in dreams too I'm usually not myself in my dreams I usually have like a bird's eye

1148
02:54:32,720 --> 02:54:36,640
perspective it's usually like I'm watching a movie or like watching something take place

1149
02:54:37,520 --> 02:54:41,760
but this time I was myself and I was outside my body seeing myself talk to like a group of people

1150
02:54:41,760 --> 02:54:46,880
and I was talking to them and I'm like hey I'm sorry I haven't been back in a long time I haven't

1151
02:54:46,880 --> 02:54:54,320
woken up in a while and I was just and then I woke up and I was like what the fuck it was just

1152
02:54:54,320 --> 02:55:05,280
fucking weird no not that hub you fuckers um yeah it's just my dreams are very vivid and weird um

1153
02:55:06,400 --> 02:55:10,560
I made it that they start yet bro we ended like two hours ago I'm so sorry my the stream was at

1154
02:55:12,080 --> 02:55:19,120
the stream was at six eastern time so we've heard you're three hours late I'm just talking about

1155
02:55:19,200 --> 02:55:25,200
stuff now um I'm crying don't cry I wish I could lose the dream

1156
02:55:26,160 --> 02:55:30,080
why do you have to ask your trips to blend to your sandy yeah so the context of this

1157
02:55:30,960 --> 02:55:35,760
chapter that I'd written it was like a spin-off of like my dream lucid dream world because I've

1158
02:55:35,760 --> 02:55:40,240
had this since I was like a little kid like a very little kid it's always been there's also this

1159
02:55:40,240 --> 02:55:44,720
place called like the factory there's another play like it's really weird why my I don't know why

1160
02:55:44,720 --> 02:55:52,240
my mind does that I'm like I don't have any fucking trauma that my mind would do that um maybe I'm

1161
02:55:52,240 --> 02:55:57,760
just like the Lulu when I'm sleeping I don't know she'd be inception but literally though

1162
02:55:57,760 --> 02:56:01,360
like I like that movie a lot because it's very it's very similar

1163
02:56:05,200 --> 02:56:09,040
my dreams are absolutely mental and extremely specific and detailed at times yes like I have

1164
02:56:09,040 --> 02:56:12,960
I literally have a I have a journal next to me where I used to write down my dreams pretty often

1165
02:56:13,760 --> 02:56:16,000
because again a lot of my dreams I feel like would make really good books

1166
02:56:18,960 --> 02:56:26,880
um because like I never elaborated on the crocodile dream that I had the other day I just

1167
02:56:26,880 --> 02:56:33,680
said you saved me from a crocodile there was so much more than that uh we were like you know

1168
02:56:33,680 --> 02:56:39,360
like old like trope and like writing that was like like maximum ride like the gifted on the run

1169
02:56:39,360 --> 02:56:44,720
like we were like that it was like me and harem on the run because we all had superpowers and like

1170
02:56:44,720 --> 02:56:48,640
there was one person that was chasing us that I think he turned into a crocodile and then we

1171
02:56:48,640 --> 02:56:57,280
killed him and ate him I have I have batched fucking dreams um I remember talking to my one of

1172
02:56:57,280 --> 02:57:00,720
my therapists one time and I'm like is there something wrong with me and she's like well you

1173
02:57:00,720 --> 02:57:06,560
know your dreams are just you know your mind working out stuff when when you're asleep from

1174
02:57:06,640 --> 02:57:12,640
what happened during the day and I'm like I don't think my mind does that because I never

1175
02:57:12,640 --> 02:57:20,800
dream about the real world I like yeah how are we actually cool yeah you guys were cool

1176
02:57:22,240 --> 02:57:28,800
I felt like I was in like a reverse harem atome game there's like a bunch of hot harem members

1177
02:57:28,800 --> 02:57:32,320
around me and we're all like on the run with our superpowers I can't remember it's been too long

1178
02:57:32,320 --> 02:57:35,120
for me to remember what the superpowers were but I think a lot of them are elemental

1179
02:57:37,440 --> 02:57:42,080
I explain why I drew a vtuber right are we cool no you're not

1180
02:57:45,120 --> 02:57:47,520
it's none of you cool you're only cool in my dreams I suppose

1181
02:57:48,720 --> 02:57:50,640
I might have not been me if it was a hot member

1182
02:57:54,240 --> 02:57:58,160
you have the drip no we were we were all like wearing the same outfit we were all in like

1183
02:57:58,160 --> 02:58:05,760
jumpsuits like it was fucking like um uh I almost said bakugan what the fuck is it anime

1184
02:58:06,720 --> 02:58:10,160
uh my hero academia

1185
02:58:13,120 --> 02:58:16,400
it's a good game it almost kind of likes your game too um

1186
02:58:17,440 --> 02:58:21,360
yeah and I remember we were like and then at one point we had to escape a jail

1187
02:58:23,280 --> 02:58:26,560
um but it was really cool to like watch it because we were all like like my dreams are also

1188
02:58:27,360 --> 02:58:31,680
the favorite character has arrived free and I go eat

1189
02:58:33,520 --> 02:58:34,560
my cat's food is going off

1190
02:58:38,480 --> 02:58:41,920
and then the other one will go off in like four minutes um

1191
02:58:43,680 --> 02:58:52,880
but um yeah my it's like I'll never have like my cats and my dreams or my parents and my dreams

1192
02:58:52,880 --> 02:58:56,080
it's very it's never I usually never dream about myself

1193
02:58:57,520 --> 02:59:04,720
very odd hi Toma it's dinner time for the harem go get your food here to your dispensers going off

1194
02:59:05,440 --> 02:59:11,040
it's Spencer my favorite streamer I know Strani and um I think somebody else that I was streaming with

1195
02:59:11,680 --> 02:59:18,080
oh yeah I think it was like Poseidon and Apollo they were just like wow I love the addition of the

1196
02:59:18,080 --> 02:59:25,360
cat food this thing I was like a really good character I was on the umibus I can't remember

1197
02:59:28,640 --> 02:59:35,440
oh everybody's been very happy with your muppetizing um of Azura by the way

1198
02:59:38,640 --> 02:59:41,920
you know how all faces and dreams are ones you see walking around day to day life

1199
02:59:42,720 --> 02:59:46,720
I've heard that I have very yeah I see like and you know how like you're not supposed to be able to

1200
02:59:46,720 --> 02:59:52,000
read in dreams I can read in dreams I don't I can read stuff it doesn't like get jumbled

1201
02:59:53,360 --> 02:59:55,680
I can control stuff it's weird because like

1202
02:59:57,520 --> 03:00:03,280
there's like there's a consistent pattern of like me being a god of like this fucking like a just a

1203
03:00:03,280 --> 03:00:11,760
really toxic goddess of my dream realm so when people don't like react a certain way I like smite them

1204
03:00:12,240 --> 03:00:22,400
you're a muppet fan art for me what is there a muppet was cute it's like big bird big bird here

1205
03:00:25,040 --> 03:00:29,040
yeah I feel like yeah I was yeah I was really old testament

1206
03:00:29,680 --> 03:00:31,120
chibi I'm not even joking

1207
03:00:33,920 --> 03:00:37,760
he doesn't want it what do you mean she doesn't want it did she say she just want to be muppetized

1208
03:00:38,000 --> 03:00:42,320
this is not like a dream to me yeah I was very

1209
03:00:44,480 --> 03:00:51,200
I'm a very harsh god forced to reckon with in greek inter-egyptian mythology and it's it's

1210
03:00:51,200 --> 03:00:56,800
interesting too because it's like again my dreams don't end they usually continue or

1211
03:00:56,800 --> 03:01:02,240
consistent or it's like I'm the god looking at like another portion of my world or I'm like oh this

1212
03:01:02,400 --> 03:01:07,120
weird shit's happening over here like I remember having like a

1213
03:01:09,120 --> 03:01:16,880
a like horror related dream of like these people had like mutated this like monster thing and it

1214
03:01:16,880 --> 03:01:22,320
escaped and it was literally like alien and I was just watching it take place but I wasn't scared

1215
03:01:22,320 --> 03:01:27,200
because I'm like oh I'm not a part of this I'm just a god oh my god that bitch just died oh yeah

1216
03:01:27,280 --> 03:01:30,560
she got yoinked she was dragged down a hallway by some like weird

1260
03:06:56,640 --> 03:06:58,480

1262
03:07:05,600 --> 03:07:08,880
oh it's playing for my other headphones I'm so stupid

1263
03:07:11,760 --> 03:07:17,040
you guys could probably hear it because I have my headphones hanging on my mic arm

1264
03:07:17,680 --> 03:07:29,600
yeah

1265
03:07:41,520 --> 03:07:44,560
maybe I should listen to the actual song because I can't remember what it sounds like

1266
03:07:47,040 --> 03:07:49,600
I should just sing the strapped version

1267
03:07:58,800 --> 03:08:03,600
yeah

1268
03:08:03,920 --> 03:08:06,160

they're gone

1272
03:08:29,760 --> 03:08:34,760
Why am I high pitched?

1273
03:08:34,760 --> 03:08:35,760
No!

1274
03:08:35,760 --> 03:08:36,760
Was that?

1275
03:08:36,760 --> 03:08:37,760
Whatever.

1276
03:08:37,760 --> 03:08:38,760
It's a cute and funny cover.

1277
03:08:38,760 --> 03:08:39,760
I don't know what I'm going to receive.

1278
03:08:39,760 --> 03:08:40,760
By the toss and I turn and I dream of what I need.

1279
03:08:40,760 --> 03:08:41,760
I need an Emmy.

1280
03:08:41,760 --> 03:08:42,760
The Emmy goes to her Emmy till the end of the night.

1281
03:08:42,760 --> 03:08:43,760
And she's gone.

1282
03:08:43,760 --> 03:08:44,760
She's gone.

1283
03:08:44,760 --> 03:08:45,760
She's gone.

1284
03:08:45,760 --> 03:08:46,760
She's gone.

1285
03:08:46,760 --> 03:08:47,760
She's gone.

1286
03:08:47,760 --> 03:08:48,760
She's gone.

1287
03:08:48,760 --> 03:08:49,760
She's gone.

1288
03:08:49,760 --> 03:08:50,760
She's gone.

1289
03:08:50,760 --> 03:08:51,760
She's gone.

1290
03:08:51,760 --> 03:08:52,760
She's gone.

1291
03:08:52,760 --> 03:09:12,760
I need an Emmy.

1292
03:09:12,760 --> 03:09:13,760
I need an Emmy till the end of the night.

1293
03:09:13,760 --> 03:09:14,760
And she's got to be strong, and she's got to be fast, and she's got to be fast, and she's got to be strong.

1294
03:09:14,760 --> 03:09:16,760
I need an Emmy till the end of the night.

1295
03:09:16,760 --> 03:09:18,760
I need an Emmy till the end of the night.

1296
03:09:18,760 --> 03:09:19,760
And she's got to be strong, and she's got to be fast, and she's got to be fast.

1297
03:09:19,760 --> 03:09:20,760
I need an Emmy till the end of the night.

1298
03:09:20,760 --> 03:09:21,760
I need an Emmy till the end of the night.

1299
03:09:21,760 --> 03:09:23,220
She's cute and small.

1300
03:09:34,120 --> 03:09:36,600
Oh my God, I'm watching a lyric video, this isn't working out for me.

1301
03:09:51,760 --> 03:09:53,760
I can't do this.

1302
03:09:53,760 --> 03:09:57,760
I can't put it off my feet.

1303
03:09:57,760 --> 03:10:00,760
I need an Emmy.

1304
03:10:00,760 --> 03:10:01,760
I need an Emmy.

1305
03:10:01,760 --> 03:10:02,760
Wait.

1306
03:10:02,760 --> 03:10:04,760
I'm holding out for an Emmy till the end of the night.

1307
03:10:04,760 --> 03:10:06,760
She's got to be stronger.

1308
03:10:06,760 --> 03:10:07,760
She's got to be faster.

1309
03:10:07,760 --> 03:10:10,760
She's got to be fresh from the fight.

1310
03:10:10,760 --> 03:10:11,760
From her flight.

1311
03:10:11,760 --> 03:10:13,760
Because she went on a trip.

1312
03:10:13,760 --> 03:10:18,760
I'm holding out for an Emmy till the end of the night.

1313
03:10:18,760 --> 03:10:20,760
It's my real voice.

1314
03:10:20,760 --> 03:10:22,760
I don't know.

1315
03:10:22,760 --> 03:10:24,760
I'm not even messing with the pitch.

1316
03:10:24,760 --> 03:10:31,760
It's like doing it by itself.

1317
03:10:31,760 --> 03:10:32,760
Okay.

1318
03:10:32,760 --> 03:10:34,760
Let's start that.

1319
03:10:34,760 --> 03:10:39,760
I don't know why hard tune is automatically making me high pitch.

1320
03:10:39,760 --> 03:10:40,760
Oh my god.

1321
03:10:40,760 --> 03:10:44,760
I wish you guys could hear the background music.

1322
03:10:44,760 --> 03:10:45,760
Honey, she is cute.

1323
03:10:45,760 --> 03:10:49,760
But you guys know I can do a cute and funny voice without the need of that.

1324
03:10:49,760 --> 03:10:51,760
That's not a squeaky twig.

1325
03:10:51,760 --> 03:10:53,760
I need a hero.

1326
03:10:53,760 --> 03:10:56,760
I need a hero till the end of the night.

1327
03:10:56,760 --> 03:10:58,760
Raina, stop chewing on my headphones.

1328
03:10:58,760 --> 03:11:00,760
Stop it.

1329
03:11:00,760 --> 03:11:02,760
And she's got to be strong.

1330
03:11:02,760 --> 03:11:04,760
And she's got to be...

1331
03:11:04,760 --> 03:11:06,760
It's cheering on my headphones.

1332
03:11:06,760 --> 03:11:07,760
Raina, please.

1333
03:11:07,760 --> 03:11:08,760
I'm begging you.

1334
03:11:08,760 --> 03:11:09,760
Stop.

1335
03:11:09,760 --> 03:11:10,760
Stop.

1336
03:11:10,760 --> 03:11:12,760
Why are you purring?

1337
03:11:12,760 --> 03:11:13,760
Let's go.

1338
03:11:13,760 --> 03:11:16,760
She's just me out.

1339
03:11:16,760 --> 03:11:19,760
She's like, hey.

1340
03:11:19,760 --> 03:11:22,760
Okay, this pitch sounds more normal.

1341
03:11:22,760 --> 03:11:26,760
Yeah, because this one I'm just voice acting.

1342
03:11:26,760 --> 03:11:27,760
Wow.

1343
03:11:27,760 --> 03:11:34,760
I need a hero.

1344
03:11:34,760 --> 03:11:36,760
Are you continuing to sing into the thick of it?

1345
03:11:36,760 --> 03:11:37,760
Oh yeah, earlier.

1346
03:11:37,760 --> 03:11:39,760
Into the thick of it.

1347
03:11:39,760 --> 03:11:41,760
Into the thick of it.

1348
03:11:41,760 --> 03:11:44,760
Into the thick of it.

1349
03:11:44,760 --> 03:11:45,760
Me.

1350
03:11:45,760 --> 03:11:48,760
I'm marching through the woods.

1351
03:11:48,760 --> 03:11:52,760
On and on we push.

1352
03:11:52,760 --> 03:11:58,760
And we don't know where we're going.

1353
03:11:58,760 --> 03:11:59,760
Into the thick of it.

1354
03:11:59,760 --> 03:12:04,760
Oh, isn't that like a crap version of something?

1355
03:12:04,760 --> 03:12:05,760
Great.

1356
03:12:05,760 --> 03:12:10,760
I'm just going to start singing for the rest of the stream again because this is fun.

1357
03:12:10,760 --> 03:12:12,760
No instrumentals.

1358
03:12:12,760 --> 03:12:16,760
I'll probably do a karaoke stream when I come back though.

1359
03:12:16,760 --> 03:12:20,760
I'm definitely going to do that.

1360
03:12:20,760 --> 03:12:31,760
Only bangers today.

1361
03:12:31,760 --> 03:12:35,760
I will sing you an actual song.

1362
03:12:35,760 --> 03:12:37,760
I can't believe you called me Chibi.

1363
03:12:37,760 --> 03:12:40,760
I'm really hurt.

1364
03:12:40,760 --> 03:12:47,760
In the arms of an angel.

1365
03:12:47,760 --> 03:12:57,760
In the arms of an angel.

1366
03:12:57,760 --> 03:12:59,760
This was Chibi Chibi Boys.

1367
03:12:59,760 --> 03:13:01,760
Ooh.

1368
03:13:01,760 --> 03:13:06,760
People forgot that I was cute and funny before.

1369
03:13:07,760 --> 03:13:10,760
Me out here waiting for that BBL Chibi cover.

1370
03:13:10,760 --> 03:13:13,760
What would it be that?

1371
03:13:13,760 --> 03:13:15,760
My anaconda don't.

1372
03:13:15,760 --> 03:13:17,760
My anaconda don't.

1373
03:13:17,760 --> 03:13:21,760
My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun.

1374
03:13:21,760 --> 03:13:25,760
Boy toy named Troy used to live in Detroit.

1375
03:13:25,760 --> 03:13:28,760
I don't know the rest of the song.

1376
03:13:28,760 --> 03:13:31,760
Addiction to love Florence and the Machine.

1377
03:13:31,760 --> 03:13:32,760
That's hard.

1378
03:13:32,760 --> 03:13:36,760
I don't know if Florence and the Machine are kidding me.

1379
03:13:36,760 --> 03:13:39,760
The perfect song to talk to you.

1380
03:13:39,760 --> 03:13:42,760
I think I've done the whole, like,

1381
03:13:42,760 --> 03:13:49,760
sort of mix a lot rap before.

1382
03:13:49,760 --> 03:13:53,760
I thought you were going to go into doodle-bob with them.

1383
03:13:53,760 --> 03:13:55,760
Oh, I'm annoyed.

1384
03:13:55,760 --> 03:13:57,760
I'm annoyed.

1385
03:13:57,760 --> 03:14:00,760
You're booming.

1386
03:14:00,760 --> 03:14:02,760
What's that?

1387
03:14:02,760 --> 03:14:04,760
What's that one song?

1388
03:14:04,760 --> 03:14:06,760
Don't cry.

1389
03:14:06,760 --> 03:14:08,760
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

1390
03:14:08,760 --> 03:14:10,760
And now I want to sing you a song.

1391
03:14:10,760 --> 03:14:12,760
And I'm going to sing you My Immortal.

1392
03:14:12,760 --> 03:14:26,760
I'm so tired of being here.

1393
03:14:26,760 --> 03:14:33,760
I'm depressed by all my childish fears.

1394
03:14:33,760 --> 03:14:39,760
And if you have to leave, I wish that you'd just leave.

1395
03:14:39,760 --> 03:14:41,760
I can't sing, by the way.

1396
03:14:41,760 --> 03:14:44,760
Because your presence still lingers here.

1397
03:14:44,760 --> 03:14:48,760
And it won't leave me alone.

1398
03:14:48,760 --> 03:14:51,760
These wounds won't seem to heal.

1399
03:14:51,760 --> 03:14:56,760
This plane is just too real.

1400
03:14:56,760 --> 03:15:02,760
There's just too much that time cannot be erased.

1401
03:15:02,760 --> 03:15:09,760
When you cry, I wipe away all of your tears.

1402
03:15:09,760 --> 03:15:16,760
When you scream, I bite away all of your fears.

1403
03:15:16,760 --> 03:15:22,760
And I held your hand through all these years.

1404
03:15:22,760 --> 03:15:34,760
Where you still have all of me.

1405
03:15:34,760 --> 03:15:40,760
That time could not erase.

1406
03:15:40,760 --> 03:15:42,760
For Cease to sing beautifully?

1407
03:15:42,760 --> 03:15:44,760
No, I don't think so.

1408
03:15:44,760 --> 03:15:48,760
I wanted to get, like, actual singing lessons.

1409
03:15:48,760 --> 03:15:50,760
My hand is a G.

1410
03:15:50,760 --> 03:15:54,760
That's another...

1411
03:15:54,760 --> 03:16:05,760
I'm going to do just Evanescence songs now.

1412
03:16:05,760 --> 03:16:07,760
Is Bring Me to Life by Evanescence Emo?

1413
03:16:07,760 --> 03:16:13,760
People also ask.

1414
03:16:13,760 --> 03:16:17,760
Well, sometimes I can hear it, like, peek with my breath.

1415
03:16:17,760 --> 03:16:21,760
Because it's trying to, like, filter them out.

1416
03:16:21,760 --> 03:16:23,760
How can...

1417
03:16:23,760 --> 03:16:25,760
Well, hold on.

1418
03:16:25,760 --> 03:16:28,760
Take a drink of water.

1419
03:16:28,760 --> 03:16:31,760
Wake me up! Wake me up inside!

1420
03:16:31,760 --> 03:16:33,760
Can't wake up! Can't wake up!

1421
03:16:33,760 --> 03:16:39,760
Save me! Save me from the nothing in the door!

1422
03:16:39,760 --> 03:16:42,760
I love that cover, by the way.

1423
03:16:42,760 --> 03:16:44,760
Um...

1424
03:16:44,760 --> 03:17:02,760
How can you see into my eyes, like open doors?

1425
03:17:02,760 --> 03:17:10,760
Leading you down into my core.

1426
03:17:10,760 --> 03:17:14,760
Where I've become so numb.

1427
03:17:14,760 --> 03:17:17,760
If I was, like, classically trained,

1428
03:17:17,760 --> 03:17:21,760
I know I could be a really good singer, but I'm not.

1429
03:17:21,760 --> 03:17:23,760
I also have the tendency...

1430
03:17:23,760 --> 03:17:25,760
I usually sing, like, the person who is singing

1431
03:17:25,760 --> 03:17:27,760
because of my ekolaleat.

1432
03:17:27,760 --> 03:17:29,760
So, like, yeah.

1433
03:17:29,760 --> 03:17:33,760
Wake me up! Wake me up inside!

1434
03:17:33,760 --> 03:17:34,760
Yeah, I can't...

1435
03:17:34,760 --> 03:17:36,760
I'm also not good with music in general.

1436
03:17:36,760 --> 03:17:39,760
Like, I don't have perfect pitch or anything, so...

1437
03:17:39,760 --> 03:17:41,760
This song hits so hard.

1438
03:17:41,760 --> 03:17:43,760
When my dad is sad, he blasts Evanescence.

1439
03:17:43,760 --> 03:17:45,760
Don't tell him I told you that.

1440
03:17:49,760 --> 03:17:53,760
Just imagine coach in his car, he's blasting Evanescence.

1441
03:17:57,760 --> 03:17:59,760
You're already a good singer?

1442
03:17:59,760 --> 03:18:02,760
No, no, I need to, I need to, like, practice and train.

1443
03:18:02,760 --> 03:18:04,760
But thank you, Amy.

1444
03:18:04,760 --> 03:18:06,760
He's valid for that.

1445
03:18:09,760 --> 03:18:12,760
It's the reverb, the reverb's helping me if I take it off.

1446
03:18:20,760 --> 03:18:21,760
Am I arms?

1447
03:18:21,760 --> 03:18:23,760
Forget it.

1448
03:18:25,760 --> 03:18:27,760
Falsetto, you stick to rapping.

1449
03:18:27,760 --> 03:18:30,760
It's like, I don't even know what my range is.

1450
03:18:32,760 --> 03:18:34,760
It's like, I can sing pretty deeply

1451
03:18:34,760 --> 03:18:37,760
because I'm more comfortable singing a lower note

1452
03:18:40,760 --> 03:18:46,760
Like, I can sing, like, male song songs a little bit easier

1453
03:18:46,760 --> 03:18:48,760
because I naturally have a deeper voice.

1454
03:18:48,760 --> 03:18:50,760
But because I have a...

1455
03:18:50,760 --> 03:18:52,760
Why? The voice strings, I can go really high.

1456
03:18:52,760 --> 03:18:55,760
Or really low. I can, like, kind of adapt when needed.

1457
03:18:56,760 --> 03:18:58,760
But yeah, I've been practicing a lot.

1458
03:18:59,760 --> 03:19:05,760
So they really want to make sure that I do Stacey's mom some justice.

1459
03:19:06,760 --> 03:19:09,760
My head voice is deeper than most people's chest voice.

1460
03:19:09,760 --> 03:19:10,760
It makes it hard to sing.

1461
03:19:10,760 --> 03:19:11,760
Oh, okay.

1462
03:19:11,760 --> 03:19:13,760
Yeah, I know that does have a factor.

1463
03:19:15,760 --> 03:19:18,760
Stacey, can I come over?

1464
03:19:18,760 --> 03:19:21,760
After school, oh, oh, oh

1465
03:19:22,760 --> 03:19:24,760
After, wait.

1466
03:19:24,760 --> 03:19:26,760
After school

1467
03:19:26,760 --> 03:19:28,760
We can hang around

1468
03:19:28,760 --> 03:19:30,760
by the pu-pu-pu-poo

1469
03:19:30,760 --> 03:19:32,760
Oh, oh, oh, oh

1470
03:19:32,760 --> 03:19:34,760
Hang by the pool

1471
03:19:35,760 --> 03:19:37,760
Did your mom get back

1472
03:19:37,760 --> 03:19:39,760
from her business trip?

1473
03:19:40,760 --> 03:19:42,760
Business trip

1474
03:19:43,760 --> 03:19:44,760
Is she there?

1475
03:19:44,760 --> 03:19:47,760
Or is she trying to give me the slip?

1476
03:19:49,760 --> 03:19:51,760
Give me the slip

1477
03:19:51,760 --> 03:19:53,760
You know I'm not the little girl

1478
03:19:53,760 --> 03:19:55,760
that I used to be

1479
03:19:55,760 --> 03:19:57,760
And since your dad walked out

1480
03:19:57,760 --> 03:19:59,760
your mom could use a girl like me

1481
03:20:01,760 --> 03:20:03,760
Stacey's mom

1482
03:20:03,760 --> 03:20:04,760
because I can't go that high

1483
03:20:04,760 --> 03:20:05,760
I can't belt

1484
03:20:06,760 --> 03:20:09,760
Stacey's mom has got it

1485
03:20:09,760 --> 03:20:11,760
That's why in my doing your mom cover

1486
03:20:11,760 --> 03:20:13,760
it sounds like I'm like quiet

1487
03:20:14,760 --> 03:20:16,760
Has got it going on

1488
03:20:17,760 --> 03:20:19,760
She's all that I wanted

1489
03:20:19,760 --> 03:20:21,760
I've waited for so long

1490
03:20:21,760 --> 03:20:23,760
Stacey, can't you see

1491
03:20:23,760 --> 03:20:25,760
you're just not the girl for me

1492
03:20:25,760 --> 03:20:27,760
I know it might be wrong

1493
03:20:27,760 --> 03:20:30,760
but I'm in love with Stacey's mom

1494
03:20:31,760 --> 03:20:35,760
na na na na na na na na na na

1495
03:20:35,760 --> 03:20:38,760
na na na na na na

1496
03:20:41,760 --> 03:20:44,760
I love video kill the radio star

1497
03:20:46,760 --> 03:20:48,760
ooh-wuh-ooh-wuh

1498
03:20:48,760 --> 03:20:50,760
boom-boom-boom-boom-boom

1499
03:20:50,760 --> 03:20:52,760
ooh-wuh-ooh-wuh

1500
03:20:52,760 --> 03:20:55,760
boom-boom-boom-boom-boom-boom

1501
03:20:57,760 --> 03:20:59,760
ah-tah-muh ah-ah

1502
03:20:59,760 --> 03:21:07,460
Biddy, I'll kill the radio star. Biddy, I'll kill the radio star.

1503
03:21:07,460 --> 03:21:15,060
In my mind and in my heart, something, something you've gone too far.

1504
03:21:15,060 --> 03:21:17,560
Oh, uh, uh, uh, oh.

1505
03:21:18,560 --> 03:21:21,560
Going for soup. Oh, yeah.

1506
03:21:21,560 --> 03:21:31,060
I already made a joke of when I think, when I was first playing with the Go XLR, someone said 1985 and I was doing, what did I say?

1507
03:21:31,060 --> 03:21:35,560
She be just hit the wall, she never had it all.

1508
03:21:35,560 --> 03:21:39,560
One prozac a day, harem's kinda gay.

1509
03:21:39,560 --> 03:21:43,560
Her dreams went out the door when she turned 54.

1510
03:21:43,560 --> 03:21:47,560
Only then would no man, what happened to her plan?

1511
03:21:47,560 --> 03:21:51,560
She was gonna be an actress, she was gonna be a star.

1512
03:21:51,560 --> 03:22:00,560
She was gonna shake her ass on the hood of Yaku's car and her yellow SUV is now the enemy.

1513
03:22:00,560 --> 03:22:23,560
All right, since Cinder, Nukstaku, waiting on Face Connect, there was Pixelink and Bishoujo, music still on YouTube music.

1514
03:22:30,560 --> 03:22:36,560
I want to do parodies. I already have one parody in mind, but I'm not gonna tell you what it is.

1515
03:22:36,560 --> 03:22:39,560
Because I have to, it's gonna take a lot to do it.

1516
03:22:39,560 --> 03:22:45,560
Because I want to make a whole animated music video for it.

1517
03:22:45,560 --> 03:22:50,560
I got your picture coming with you, dear Maria, count me in.

1518
03:22:50,560 --> 03:22:55,560
There's a story at the bottom of this bottle and I'm the pen.

1519
03:22:59,560 --> 03:23:01,560
I had you in the first one.

1520
03:23:02,560 --> 03:23:14,560
Just eat it.

1521
03:23:14,560 --> 03:23:19,560
You guys can see I'm also moving a lot.

1522
03:23:19,560 --> 03:23:26,560
I need a 3D model so bad because you guys can't see how much I'm gesturing and dancing while I'm doing this.

1523
03:23:32,560 --> 03:23:39,560
Honestly, like, stuck in the drive-thru is one of my favorite, like, jokie songs.

1524
03:23:39,560 --> 03:23:44,560
Just eat it.

1525
03:23:44,560 --> 03:23:47,560
How often do you get the mic?

1526
03:23:47,560 --> 03:23:49,560
Sorry, we can tell.

1527
03:23:49,560 --> 03:23:51,560
I know, I'm like, I'm swinging my hand.

1528
03:23:51,560 --> 03:23:58,560
I'm like, I'm smacking my, what's the thing that suspends it?

1529
03:23:58,560 --> 03:24:03,560
Oh, I need to fix the wires on it, though.

1530
03:24:03,560 --> 03:24:05,560
There we go.

1531
03:24:05,560 --> 03:24:10,560
Sometimes the wires slip.

1532
03:24:10,560 --> 03:24:15,560
I don't remember whether to start something.

1533
03:24:15,560 --> 03:24:17,560
I need a burp.

1534
03:24:17,560 --> 03:24:22,560
No burps for you.

1535
03:24:22,560 --> 03:24:27,560
They get muted.

1536
03:24:28,560 --> 03:24:31,560
Check, yes, Juliet, are you with me?

1537
03:24:31,560 --> 03:24:34,560
Rain is pouring down on the sidewalk.

1538
03:24:34,560 --> 03:24:36,560
Sorry.

1539
03:24:36,560 --> 03:24:39,560
Denied.

1540
03:24:39,560 --> 03:24:41,560
Mambo number five.

1541
03:24:41,560 --> 03:24:43,560
A little bit of straw knee in my life.

1542
03:24:43,560 --> 03:24:47,560
A little bit, a little bit of mercy.

1543
03:24:47,560 --> 03:24:55,560
It works because a lot of our names end in E, so that actually would work.

1544
03:24:55,560 --> 03:24:58,560
A little bit of Zura in the sun.

1545
03:24:58,560 --> 03:25:01,560
A little bit of Emmy all night long.

1546
03:25:01,560 --> 03:25:08,560
A little bit of shivvy makes me your man, your woman, your woman, your Dom.

1547
03:25:08,560 --> 03:25:16,560
Yeah, but then he does say Jessica, so you can say Azura because it's the same syllables.

1548
03:25:16,560 --> 03:25:21,560
A little bit of icy going on.

1549
03:25:21,560 --> 03:25:23,560
The snowberries are like, don't forget icy.

1550
03:25:23,560 --> 03:25:26,560
Don't worry, I didn't forget icy.

1551
03:25:26,560 --> 03:25:28,560
What's that one rap?

1552
03:25:28,560 --> 03:25:38,560
Every time I see Icy's name, I think of that one rap by Saweetie.

1553
03:25:38,560 --> 03:25:42,560
No, I don't want the Wikipedia page.

1554
03:25:42,560 --> 03:25:44,560
Can't stop. Won't stop.

1555
03:25:44,560 --> 03:25:45,560
Gikwap.

1556
03:25:45,560 --> 03:25:46,560
Ten white toes in them.

1557
03:25:46,560 --> 03:25:47,560
Tori.

1558
03:25:47,560 --> 03:25:48,560
Flip flops.

1559
03:25:48,560 --> 03:25:49,560
Many cures of pedicures.

1560
03:25:49,560 --> 03:25:50,560
I'm always tip top.

1561
03:25:50,560 --> 03:25:51,560
I'm not hot.

1562
03:25:51,560 --> 03:25:53,560
All these lies need to stop because I'm icy.

1563
03:25:53,560 --> 03:25:54,560
Wifey.

1564
03:25:54,560 --> 03:25:55,560
Haters want to fight me.

1565
03:25:55,560 --> 03:25:57,560
Never been the one to get a wrap up on a white tee.

1566
03:25:57,560 --> 03:25:58,560
Keep my hands clean.

1567
03:25:58,560 --> 03:25:59,560
Got some hitters moving shiesty.

1568
03:25:59,560 --> 03:26:02,560
Asking if I'm rolling with some Gucci bitch I might be.

1569
03:26:02,560 --> 03:26:03,560
It's very unlikely.

1570
03:26:03,560 --> 03:26:05,560
My wrist looking icy.

1571
03:26:05,560 --> 03:26:12,560
Charge it by the minute because my time is very pricey.

1572
03:26:12,560 --> 03:26:15,560
Ain't no rest for the wicked.

1573
03:26:15,560 --> 03:26:19,560
Money don't grow on trees.

1574
03:26:19,560 --> 03:26:21,560
I like to, I am very good.

1575
03:26:21,560 --> 03:26:25,560
I think I'm good at rapping.

1576
03:26:25,560 --> 03:26:27,560
I used to do karaoke a little.

1577
03:26:27,560 --> 03:26:32,560
I think I did like a whole like Childish Gambino karaoke and Tyler, Tyler the creator karaoke

1578
03:26:32,560 --> 03:26:34,560
because they're my favorite rappers.

1579
03:26:34,560 --> 03:26:37,560
I think I did, I think I did like a Kendrick one.

1580
03:26:37,560 --> 03:26:41,560
But I was rapping bonfire and everybody was like losing their minds.

1581
03:26:41,560 --> 03:26:45,560
It was so funny.

1582
03:26:45,560 --> 03:26:47,560
You're very good.

1583
03:26:47,560 --> 03:26:48,560
Thanks.

1584
03:26:48,560 --> 03:26:49,560
All right.

1585
03:26:49,560 --> 03:26:50,560
It's Childish Gambino.

1586
03:26:50,560 --> 03:26:55,560
Homegirls drop it like the NASDAQ move white girls like there's coke up my ass crack.

1587
03:26:55,560 --> 03:27:00,560
I just fucking love Childish Gambino's lyricism.

1588
03:27:00,560 --> 03:27:02,560
Junior mom is an exemplary pretty good.

1589
03:27:02,560 --> 03:27:03,560
Thank you.

1590
03:27:03,560 --> 03:27:04,560
Appreciate it.

1591
03:27:04,560 --> 03:27:14,560
Honestly, I will sing praises of mercy, however, because she did her whole song in one take

1592
03:27:14,560 --> 03:27:16,560
because she thought she had to.

1593
03:27:16,560 --> 03:27:18,560
She never recorded things before.

1594
03:27:18,560 --> 03:27:19,560
Never recorded music.

1595
03:27:19,560 --> 03:27:22,560
Neither have I, but I didn't think that she's just like one shot.

1596
03:27:22,560 --> 03:27:24,560
She did that all in one fucking take.

1597
03:27:24,560 --> 03:27:27,560
Can you believe that?

1598
03:27:27,560 --> 03:27:32,560
My, my, my gen mates are so talented.

1599
03:27:32,560 --> 03:27:34,560
Yeah, I love Mercy's cover.

1600
03:27:34,560 --> 03:27:36,560
Like she's like, I don't like it.

1601
03:27:36,560 --> 03:27:39,560
I'm like, this is freaking flames.

1602
03:27:39,560 --> 03:27:41,560
Why don't you call 45 karaoke bar?

1603
03:27:41,560 --> 03:27:43,560
Well, I think what was the last?

1604
03:27:43,560 --> 03:27:52,560
When I first started at my job, my last job, which was almost six years ago for like a

1605
03:27:52,560 --> 03:27:56,560
team building thing that took the new hires out to karaoke.

1606
03:27:56,560 --> 03:28:00,560
And that was the first time I hung out with Olive and we sing.

1607
03:28:00,560 --> 03:28:02,560
What are we saying together?

1608
03:28:02,560 --> 03:28:04,560
We sang the Spice Girls.

1609
03:28:04,560 --> 03:28:10,560
If you want to be my lover, that was really cute.

1610
03:28:10,560 --> 03:28:12,560
I'll tell you what I want.

1611
03:28:12,560 --> 03:28:13,560
I want to really, really want.

1612
03:28:13,560 --> 03:28:14,560
So tell me what you want.

1613
03:28:14,560 --> 03:28:15,560
What you really, really want.

1614
03:28:15,560 --> 03:28:19,560
I want to, I want to, I want to, I want to, I want to really, really, really sing.

1615
03:28:19,560 --> 03:28:24,560
If you want to be my lover, you got to get with my friends.

1616
03:28:24,560 --> 03:28:26,560
They can last forever.

1617
03:28:26,560 --> 03:28:28,560
Friendship never ends.

1618
03:28:28,560 --> 03:28:30,560
If you want to be my lover.

1619
03:28:30,560 --> 03:28:33,560
You guys can't see, but I'm really rocking.

1620
03:28:33,560 --> 03:28:35,560
Yeah, it was really great.

1621
03:28:35,560 --> 03:28:39,560
That literally was the beginning of our friendship to sing that together with her.

1622
03:28:40,560 --> 03:28:42,560
Can't wait for me to be on their covers.

1623
03:28:42,560 --> 03:28:43,560
Yes, I'm working on one.

1624
03:28:43,560 --> 03:28:45,560
Do I need to work on one?

1625
03:28:45,560 --> 03:28:47,560
Maybe I'll do that.

1626
03:28:47,560 --> 03:28:51,560
When I come back, I don't want to over, overdo myself because I'm already going to work on

1627
03:28:51,560 --> 03:28:55,560
probably a gameplay video and then an ASMR video.

1628
03:28:55,560 --> 03:28:57,560
I don't really rock the Spice Girls.

1629
03:28:57,560 --> 03:28:58,560
I'll dance however I want.

1630
03:28:58,560 --> 03:29:03,560
I'm just waving my arms around and then I just end up really rocking.

1631
03:29:03,560 --> 03:29:04,560
Ooh, a cover.

1632
03:29:04,560 --> 03:29:05,560
Yeah.

1633
03:29:05,560 --> 03:29:08,560
I want to, my next cover is going to be Stacey's mom.

1634
03:29:08,560 --> 03:29:10,560
100%.

1635
03:29:10,560 --> 03:29:14,560
Slay queen.

1636
03:29:14,560 --> 03:29:18,560
And then Shawnee says I have to cover five bars, five seconds.

1637
03:29:18,560 --> 03:29:20,560
So I will do that next.

1638
03:29:20,560 --> 03:29:22,560
Because that'll be a funny short, actually.

1639
03:29:22,560 --> 03:29:27,560
Actually, I think since I already technically did that in my Elden Drink stream or my Haiti stream,

1640
03:29:27,560 --> 03:29:29,560
I can't remember which one it was.

1641
03:29:29,560 --> 03:29:31,560
That should be clipped.

1642
03:29:31,560 --> 03:29:33,560
Wait, I think someone did clip it.

1643
03:29:33,560 --> 03:29:37,560
And I'm just going to package it down even more and then make it into a short in the scent

1644
03:29:37,560 --> 03:29:39,560
of Shawnee because it'll make her day.

1645
03:29:39,560 --> 03:29:41,560
Play all those arms queen.

1646
03:29:41,560 --> 03:29:42,560
It's funny.

1647
03:29:42,560 --> 03:29:46,560
I'm still learning how to pilot my model properly because I move my arms a lot,

1648
03:29:46,560 --> 03:29:47,560
but I don't move my body.

1649
03:29:47,560 --> 03:29:50,560
But I'm like, no, you got to move around.

1650
03:29:50,560 --> 03:29:51,560
You got to bounce with it.

1651
03:29:51,560 --> 03:29:52,560
You wouldn't rock with it.

1652
03:29:52,560 --> 03:29:54,560
You wouldn't rock with it.

1653
03:29:54,560 --> 03:29:56,560
Oh, I forgot to put my cover up on.

1654
03:29:56,560 --> 03:29:58,560
Oh, frick.

1655
03:29:58,560 --> 03:30:00,560
Shit.

1656
03:30:00,560 --> 03:30:12,560
No.

1657
03:30:12,560 --> 03:30:15,560
Sorry.

1658
03:30:15,560 --> 03:30:23,560
No.

1659
03:30:23,560 --> 03:30:24,560
What do you mean?

1660
03:30:24,560 --> 03:30:29,560
No, I knew the entire time I had reverb and echo still on.

1661
03:30:29,560 --> 03:30:32,560
I can't hear it in my headphones.

1662
03:30:32,560 --> 03:30:57,560
That's all in song.

1663
03:30:58,560 --> 03:30:59,560
It's great though.

1664
03:30:59,560 --> 03:31:01,560
You know, it's a classic echo.

1665
03:31:01,560 --> 03:31:03,560
Echo, echo, echo.

1666
03:31:03,560 --> 03:31:05,560
I love a song too.

1667
03:31:05,560 --> 03:31:06,560
I love that song.

1668
03:31:06,560 --> 03:31:09,560
Thanks for hearing from Kingdom Hearts.

1669
03:31:09,560 --> 03:31:13,560
Oh, it's great.

1670
03:31:13,560 --> 03:31:18,560
I would just like have that song repeat and also simply and clean.

1671
03:31:19,560 --> 03:31:26,560
I have like an essence stuck in my head so I can't bring off lyrics.

1672
03:31:26,560 --> 03:31:34,560
Simple and clean.

1673
03:31:34,560 --> 03:31:37,560
When you walk away.

1674
03:31:37,560 --> 03:31:39,560
Wait, no.

1675
03:31:39,560 --> 03:31:46,560
Take a deep breath for that one.

1676
03:31:46,560 --> 03:31:47,560
I know.

1677
03:31:47,560 --> 03:31:52,560
Sanctuary, in my opinion, is the best Kingdom Hearts song.

1678
03:31:52,560 --> 03:32:05,560
When you walk away, you don't hear me say, please, oh baby, don't go simple and clean.

1679
03:32:05,560 --> 03:32:07,560
I can hear myself peeking in my headphones.

1680
03:32:07,560 --> 03:32:08,560
I don't like it.

1681
03:32:08,560 --> 03:32:13,560
It's the way that you're breaking me feel tonight.

1682
03:32:13,560 --> 03:32:18,560
It's hard to let it go.

1683
03:32:18,560 --> 03:32:21,560
Yeah, something like that.

1684
03:32:21,560 --> 03:32:34,560
Also, I really used to like Tommy Heavenly.

1685
03:32:34,560 --> 03:32:47,560
Because I love Soul Eater as some of you may know.

1686
03:32:47,560 --> 03:32:48,560
I'm not.

1687
03:32:48,560 --> 03:32:52,560
Wait, where's the Romanji?

1688
03:32:52,560 --> 03:32:53,560
Oh wait, Amelie covered that?

1689
03:32:53,560 --> 03:32:55,560
I have to listen to that then.

1690
03:32:55,560 --> 03:33:00,560
Because it popped up when I was typing Romanji.

1691
03:33:00,560 --> 03:33:01,560
This is not Romanized.

1692
03:33:01,560 --> 03:33:10,560
This is the same thing as before.

1693
03:33:10,560 --> 03:33:14,560
My cats have the zoomies.

1694
03:33:14,560 --> 03:33:15,560
Yes, Black Paper Moon.

1695
03:33:15,560 --> 03:33:16,560
I'm late.

1696
03:33:16,560 --> 03:33:17,560
Hi Nori.

1697
03:33:17,560 --> 03:33:21,560
I'm just singing stuff.

1698
03:33:21,560 --> 03:33:25,560
I'm fall.

1699
03:33:25,560 --> 03:33:26,560
I'm fall.

1700
03:33:26,560 --> 03:33:27,560
I'm fall.

1701
03:33:27,560 --> 03:33:32,560
I can't hit notes, bro.

1702
03:33:32,560 --> 03:33:43,560
I'm falling down into my shadow.

1703
03:33:43,560 --> 03:33:45,560
I can also can't read Japanese.

1704
03:33:45,560 --> 03:33:55,560
I'm falling down into my shadow.

1705
03:33:55,560 --> 03:34:05,560
I'm falling down into my shadow.

1706
03:34:05,560 --> 03:34:15,560
I'm falling down into my shadow.

1707
03:34:15,560 --> 03:34:25,560
I'm falling down into my shadow.

1708
03:34:25,560 --> 03:34:36,560
What's my cat doing?

1709
03:34:36,560 --> 03:34:41,560
Raina, what are you doing?

1710
03:34:41,560 --> 03:34:42,560
I'm not late.

1711
03:34:42,560 --> 03:34:44,560
We're so up.

1712
03:34:44,560 --> 03:34:45,560
I can't read Japanese.

1713
03:34:45,560 --> 03:34:47,560
I can't read Romanji.

1714
03:34:47,560 --> 03:34:48,560
Don't cry.

1715
03:34:48,560 --> 03:34:49,560
Don't cry.

1716
03:34:49,560 --> 03:34:50,560
Stop singing.

1717
03:34:50,560 --> 03:34:51,560
Stop crying.

1718
03:34:51,560 --> 03:35:02,560
I listen to a lot of Tommy Heavenly when I was younger in my weeb era and K-pop.

1719
03:35:02,560 --> 03:35:05,560
What's that?

1720
03:35:05,560 --> 03:35:06,560
Lucifer by SHINee.

1721
03:35:06,560 --> 03:35:11,560
This is my favorite K-pop song.

1722
03:35:11,560 --> 03:35:12,560
Lyrics.

1723
03:35:12,560 --> 03:35:13,560
Romanize.

1724
03:35:13,560 --> 03:35:18,560
I'm going to butcher some Korean.

1725
03:35:18,560 --> 03:35:21,560
Wait, the ad popped up.

1726
03:35:21,560 --> 03:35:22,560
I can't read this.

1727
03:35:22,560 --> 03:35:24,560
Raina, what are you doing?

1728
03:35:24,560 --> 03:35:26,560
You're like, I can hear you crashing stuff.

1729
03:35:26,560 --> 03:35:28,560
Just lay down, lady.

1730
03:35:28,560 --> 03:35:30,560
Rest in peace.

1731
03:35:30,560 --> 03:35:33,560
By the way.

1732
03:35:34,560 --> 03:35:36,560
Wait.

1733
03:35:57,560 --> 03:35:59,560
I also used to know the dance.

1734
03:35:59,560 --> 03:36:03,560
I used to know a lot of Korean choreography, K-pop choreography.

1735
03:36:03,560 --> 03:36:06,560
Like rocking from team top.

1736
03:36:06,560 --> 03:36:07,560
Team top.

1737
03:36:07,560 --> 03:36:08,560
We don't make team top.

1738
03:36:08,560 --> 03:36:09,560
Team top.

1739
03:36:09,560 --> 03:36:11,560
We don't rock it, pop it, stop it.

1740
03:36:21,560 --> 03:36:27,560
I'm going to show you the choreography for that for a quick second.

1741
03:36:27,560 --> 03:36:30,560
She beat love by beats for cats to wreck the house too.

1742
03:36:30,560 --> 03:36:33,560
She knocked over like...

1743
03:36:33,560 --> 03:36:35,560
All my plants doing fine actually.

1744
03:36:35,560 --> 03:36:36,560
She didn't knock it over.

1745
03:36:36,560 --> 03:36:38,560
I think she just bumped it.

1746
03:36:38,560 --> 03:36:39,560
Heading to bed.

1747
03:36:39,560 --> 03:36:40,560
Have a good sleep.

1748
03:36:40,560 --> 03:36:41,560
Sleep.

1749
03:36:41,560 --> 03:36:42,560
Sleep.

1750
03:36:42,560 --> 03:36:43,560
Sleep.

1751
03:36:43,560 --> 03:36:45,560
Sleep and Eep.

1752
03:36:45,560 --> 03:36:47,560
Um...

1753
03:36:47,560 --> 03:36:51,560
I just think of Mickey Mouse.

1754
03:36:51,560 --> 03:36:52,560
I just think of Mickey Mouse.

1755
03:36:52,560 --> 03:36:53,560
I just think of Mickey Mouse.

1756
03:36:53,560 --> 03:36:54,560
I just think of Mickey Mouse.

1757
03:36:54,560 --> 03:36:55,560
I just think of Mickey Mouse.

1758
03:36:55,560 --> 03:36:56,560
What's up?

1759
03:36:56,560 --> 03:36:59,560
Oh, something here.

1760
03:37:04,560 --> 03:37:06,560
What are you doing?

1761
03:37:06,560 --> 03:37:10,560
She just has her head buried in the crook of my elbow.

1762
03:37:10,560 --> 03:37:13,560
Eating the Korean produce right now.

1763
03:37:13,560 --> 03:37:16,560
I'm going to show you real...

1764
03:37:16,560 --> 03:37:18,560
No, you can look it up.

1765
03:37:18,560 --> 03:37:21,560
Look up team top rocking.

1766
03:37:21,560 --> 03:37:24,560
The song used to go so hard.

1767
03:37:24,560 --> 03:37:29,560
I used to be able to know the choreography team top.

1768
03:37:29,560 --> 03:37:34,560
And to scroll in like the middle.

1769
03:37:34,560 --> 03:37:38,560
Fucking ad bro.

1770
03:37:38,560 --> 03:37:40,560
Yes, you'll see the Mickey.

1771
03:37:40,560 --> 03:37:51,560
Sleep is slipping out.

1772
03:37:51,560 --> 03:38:03,560
Such a bop.

1773
03:38:03,560 --> 03:38:06,560
Yeah, I really like K-pop because of the urban influences in it.

1774
03:38:06,560 --> 03:38:13,560
And it was like a combination of like Asian culture and urban culture.

1775
03:38:13,560 --> 03:38:17,560
And I like literally just like start shuffling in this music video and it was so sick.

1776
03:38:17,560 --> 03:38:21,560
So I had to learn it.

1777
03:38:21,560 --> 03:38:26,560
And I preferred male choreography because they actually dance.

1778
03:38:26,560 --> 03:38:28,560
The girls just like walked around all cutely.

1779
03:38:28,560 --> 03:38:29,560
Actually, no, that's a lie.

1780
03:38:29,560 --> 03:38:41,560
I did like electric shock from girls generation.

1781
03:38:41,560 --> 03:38:51,560
It's a girls generation.

1782
03:38:51,560 --> 03:38:56,560
No, it was by FX.

1783
03:38:56,560 --> 03:38:59,560
E-E-E-E electric shock.

1784
03:38:59,560 --> 03:39:01,560
Na na na na na na.

1785
03:39:01,560 --> 03:39:03,560
Na na na na na na.

1786
03:39:03,560 --> 03:39:10,560
E-E-E electric shock.

1787
03:39:10,560 --> 03:39:15,560
That was a nice gauge for girls generation.

1788
03:39:15,560 --> 03:39:17,560
Listening to new jeans around the home.

1789
03:39:17,560 --> 03:39:19,560
He's got some questioning or friendship.

1790
03:39:19,560 --> 03:39:21,560
New jeans is good.

1791
03:39:21,560 --> 03:39:24,560
I don't really listen to a lot of Korean music anymore, though.

1792
03:39:24,560 --> 03:39:30,560
I usually just listen to, I've been listening to a lot of Tyler.

1793
03:39:30,560 --> 03:39:37,560
A lot of K-Tranota.

1794
03:39:37,560 --> 03:39:42,560
I've been going through my old music and listening to it since I was listening to my self-indulgence the other day.

1795
03:39:42,560 --> 03:39:45,560
I have a very wide taste of music.

1796
03:39:45,560 --> 03:39:50,560
Very wide range, wide taste of music.

1797
03:39:50,560 --> 03:40:01,560
And people talk about things they like will not have any clue what they're talking about as long as they're on my first date.

1798
03:40:01,560 --> 03:40:06,560
Boomi, what are you doing?

1799
03:40:06,560 --> 03:40:08,560
Boomi, are you Zoomin?

1800
03:40:08,560 --> 03:40:22,560
Are you Metro Zoomin? Metro Boomin Zoomin?

1801
03:40:22,560 --> 03:40:25,560
Why are you running everywhere?

1802
03:40:26,560 --> 03:40:32,560
I'm just like jumping.

1803
03:40:32,560 --> 03:40:40,560
Please don't chew on my wires. Thank you. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Woo!

1804
03:40:40,560 --> 03:40:45,560
Why are you running? Why are you running?

1805
03:40:45,560 --> 03:40:47,560
I have electric shock stuck in my head.

1806
03:40:47,560 --> 03:40:54,560
Sorry, I got distracted by reading fanfiction, my own old class stuff, and then singing.

1807
03:40:54,560 --> 03:40:57,560
I am so sorry.

1808
03:40:57,560 --> 03:41:02,560
I am so sorry.

1809
03:41:02,560 --> 03:41:05,560
I just get so distracted in the sidetracks.

1810
03:41:05,560 --> 03:41:09,560
You never knew cats got Zoomies? Are you kidding me? Cats are Zoomie masters.

1811
03:41:09,560 --> 03:41:11,560
You thought dogs were its cats, dude.

1812
03:41:11,560 --> 03:41:13,560
Are you gonna leave?

1813
03:41:13,560 --> 03:41:16,560
I don't know.

1814
03:41:16,560 --> 03:41:18,560
Why am I streaming tomorrow? Hold on.

1815
03:41:18,560 --> 03:41:23,560
I think I'm streaming. Why does my mic sound like it's cutting out?

1816
03:41:23,560 --> 03:41:30,560
It's like really weird sounding because it's trying to filter my voice for whatever fucking reason.

1817
03:41:30,560 --> 03:41:40,560
It's really kind of annoying. I wish I would stop doing that.

1818
03:41:40,560 --> 03:41:54,560
And some of my singing was nice. Keywords, some, some.

1819
03:41:54,560 --> 03:41:58,560
What does that do? I'm just pressing buttons on my goXLR wondering what the heck's going on.

1820
03:41:58,560 --> 03:42:06,560
I mean, I'm like, why is the gate so high?

1821
03:42:06,560 --> 03:42:14,560
That's why it's, I don't know why. Sometimes it like messes up stuff on purpose.

1822
03:42:14,560 --> 03:42:22,560
That's my cat, Tokyo drifting if you didn't hear.

1823
03:42:22,560 --> 03:42:26,560
I couldn't tell you which one it was though because they're all just standing and staring at each other like that one.

1824
03:42:27,560 --> 03:42:30,560
Because it had fun.

1825
03:42:48,560 --> 03:42:50,560
Can he drive? No, he can't.

1826
03:42:56,560 --> 03:43:04,560
If you know how they live in Tokyo, if you've seen it and you need it and you know you have to go fast and furious.

1827
03:43:04,560 --> 03:43:08,560
Drift, drift, drift, fast and furious.

1828
03:43:08,560 --> 03:43:12,560
Drift, drift, drift.

1829
03:43:12,560 --> 03:43:17,560
That song goes so hard. I want to watch Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift now.

1830
03:43:17,560 --> 03:43:20,560
I haven't watched that in a long time.

1831
03:43:26,560 --> 03:43:38,560
That's pretty clever.

1832
03:43:38,560 --> 03:43:40,560
That was pretty clever.

1833
03:43:40,560 --> 03:43:44,560
I listened to that song so much you triggered something in my brain.

1834
03:43:44,560 --> 03:43:48,560
Fast and Furious is never the same after that.

1835
03:43:48,560 --> 03:43:54,560
I haven't seen, I think the last movie I saw was like either Fast 5 or Fast 6.

1836
03:43:54,560 --> 03:43:59,560
I heard that they're on the 11th movie now or it's in production.

1837
03:43:59,560 --> 03:44:02,560
Thank you by the way, Morgan for the tip.

1838
03:44:08,560 --> 03:44:10,560
The last one was like 4.

1839
03:44:10,560 --> 03:44:16,560
Tokyo Drift was like not even a good one though.

1840
03:44:16,560 --> 03:44:22,560
The text to speech didn't go off because I have my desktop audio muted.

1841
03:44:22,560 --> 03:44:24,560
So don't worry.

1842
03:44:24,560 --> 03:44:30,560
Because I didn't, when I was playing music earlier from when I was singing to Emmy, I didn't want to mess it up.

1843
03:44:30,560 --> 03:44:34,560
And like it claimed or something.

1844
03:44:34,560 --> 03:44:40,560
I get demonetized either way because of my tickle bitties.

1845
03:44:40,560 --> 03:44:44,560
Oh, my neighbors don't hate me too much.

1846
03:44:44,560 --> 03:44:50,560
I'm singing at the same level as my TV when I put it up.

1847
03:44:50,560 --> 03:44:54,560
It's fine.

1848
03:44:54,560 --> 03:44:56,560
Tokyo Drift was the third one.

1849
03:44:56,560 --> 03:45:00,560
Honestly, the first, second, and third were good.

1850
03:45:00,560 --> 03:45:04,560
Tokyo Drift wasn't good but soundtrack and scene were good.

1851
03:45:04,560 --> 03:45:06,560
I agree with that.

1852
03:45:06,560 --> 03:45:08,560
Hardcore.

1853
03:45:08,560 --> 03:45:20,560
I put my BGM back up so we're not just like listening to weird silence in my AC lightly in the background.

1854
03:45:20,560 --> 03:45:26,560
Wait, why weren't they allowed to film in Shibuya?

1855
03:45:26,560 --> 03:45:32,560
I didn't know that.

1856
03:45:32,560 --> 03:45:34,560
I honestly just wish the main character wasn't that dude.

1857
03:45:34,560 --> 03:45:36,560
I wish it was Paul Walker.

1858
03:45:36,560 --> 03:45:38,560
He just like randomly is in Japan for no reason.

1859
03:45:38,560 --> 03:45:40,560
I feel like that would have been funny.

1860
03:45:40,560 --> 03:45:44,560
It's like, uh, Brian, we heard about, what was his name?

1861
03:45:44,560 --> 03:45:46,560
Wasn't it Ryan?

1862
03:45:46,560 --> 03:45:48,560
We heard about something.

1863
03:45:48,560 --> 03:45:50,560
Oh, Brian, that's what it was.

1864
03:45:50,560 --> 03:45:54,560
Brian, we heard about something and we need you to go to Japan because you know about this stuff.

1865
03:45:54,560 --> 03:45:58,560
Go.

1866
03:45:58,560 --> 03:46:00,560
Oh, people are, oh, that's terrible actually.

1867
03:46:00,560 --> 03:46:02,560
It wasn't safe.

1868
03:46:02,560 --> 03:46:04,560
Oh my God.

1869
03:46:04,560 --> 03:46:08,560
Damn.

1870
03:46:08,560 --> 03:46:16,560
Oh, let me, let's look at my schedule because I said I was going to do that.

1871
03:46:16,560 --> 03:46:28,560
Okay, so, yeah, we have Elden Ring tomorrow and then Elden Ring after that.

1872
03:46:28,560 --> 03:46:32,560
Because we're getting to the DLC.

1873
03:46:32,560 --> 03:46:34,560
I've been reading up on the DLC by the way.

1874
03:46:34,560 --> 03:46:36,560
I don't care about spoilers and shit.

1875
03:46:36,560 --> 03:46:40,560
I like to go into games like this prepared.

1876
03:46:40,560 --> 03:46:48,560
And so I was watching like things you should do and like what levels you should be at and all that stuff.

1877
03:46:48,560 --> 03:46:52,560
So the next two days are playing Elden Ring.

1878
03:46:52,560 --> 03:46:54,560
And honestly, I don't think we already be redone.

1879
03:46:54,560 --> 03:47:04,560
I still have to go and kill Godfree, which is going to take fucking forever.

1880
03:47:04,560 --> 03:47:10,560
Do I have to kill his mirage self or do I have to actually kill him?

1881
03:47:10,560 --> 03:47:14,560
Because in my game, I didn't even bother fighting him.

1882
03:47:14,560 --> 03:47:22,560
I just killed his fake version and that was it.

1883
03:47:22,560 --> 03:47:26,560
I never fought Horaloo.

1884
03:47:26,560 --> 03:47:30,560
Yeah, I need to get Moog.

1885
03:47:30,560 --> 03:47:32,560
Okay, okay, the mirage.

1886
03:47:32,560 --> 03:47:34,560
Okay, cool, cool, cool.

1887
03:47:34,560 --> 03:47:36,560
That's fine then.

1888
03:47:36,560 --> 03:47:38,560
I have to kill Moog.

1889
03:47:38,560 --> 03:47:42,560
And for that, I was looking up what Moog's week two and it's literally blood poison.

1890
03:47:42,560 --> 03:47:46,560
Like anything that like procs after a long time like scarlet rot.

1891
03:47:46,560 --> 03:47:50,560
I'm like, but the thing is he's like,

1892
03:47:50,560 --> 03:47:56,560
he has resistance like 40% to like fire or like 80% to like fucking fire or something.

1893
03:47:56,560 --> 03:48:02,560
And then like 40% to all the others or 20% to all the others to all the other elements.

1894
03:48:02,560 --> 03:48:08,560
I think he's like 20 or 40 or 30% resistant to magic.

1895
03:48:08,560 --> 03:48:12,560
So I'm wondering if I need to get another fucking weapon.

1896
03:48:12,560 --> 03:48:16,560
Probably worth killing the last two sacred tears.

1897
03:48:16,560 --> 03:48:20,560
That's a good point.

1898
03:48:20,560 --> 03:48:24,560
I killed, I remember in my first playthrough, I killed Morgoth on the first try and I was really

1899
03:48:24,560 --> 03:48:28,560
or like the, at least like the third try and I was like, what?

1900
03:48:28,560 --> 03:48:34,560
That's because I was just spamming the black knife the entire time to get that like death blight.

1901
03:48:34,560 --> 03:48:42,560
Yeah, I'm just wondering if it's going to be smart going into the Moog fight with the moon veil.

1902
03:48:42,560 --> 03:48:44,560
I don't think so.

1903
03:48:45,560 --> 03:48:47,560
Um.

1904
03:48:49,560 --> 03:48:50,560
Oh, yeah.

1905
03:48:50,560 --> 03:48:52,560
Okay.

1906
03:48:52,560 --> 03:48:54,560
Yeah.

1907
03:48:54,560 --> 03:49:02,560
And then we have on Saturday, which I'm really, really looking forward to is the rating VTubers designs.

1908
03:49:02,560 --> 03:49:03,560
I can't wait.

1909
03:49:03,560 --> 03:49:04,560
It's going to be fun.

1910
03:49:04,560 --> 03:49:07,560
And then we have the May plus concert watch along on Sunday.

1911
03:49:07,560 --> 03:49:12,560
And then before I leave on Thursday,

1912
03:49:13,560 --> 03:49:15,560
a little sneak peek of my schedule ahead.

1913
03:49:15,560 --> 03:49:21,560
We're doing the Twilight watch along on Monday the 15th.

1914
03:49:21,560 --> 03:49:30,560
And unless I might change that because I have to bring Reina to the doctor that day too at 9am.

1915
03:49:30,560 --> 03:49:33,560
So if everything's fine, then yes, it will continue.

1916
03:49:33,560 --> 03:49:36,560
If it's not fine, I will keep you posted.

1917
03:49:36,560 --> 03:49:40,560
And then I have a collab with Mercy on Tuesday.

1918
03:49:40,560 --> 03:49:42,560
I convinced her to play Super Bunny Man with me.

1919
03:49:42,560 --> 03:49:45,560
And I know we're going to have lots of fun and laugh at that.

1920
03:49:45,560 --> 03:49:54,560
And then Wednesday before I go, I'm going to do an ASMR stream where I'm your big sister and I put makeup on you as torture.

1921
03:49:54,560 --> 03:50:02,560
And then yeah, and then I'll be gone until I so technically I'm back.

1922
03:50:03,560 --> 03:50:08,560
The 22nd or 23rd.

1923
03:50:08,560 --> 03:50:09,560
I can't remember.

1924
03:50:09,560 --> 03:50:11,560
I have to look at my flight.

1925
03:50:13,560 --> 03:50:16,560
Can't remember if it's early or late.

1926
03:50:18,560 --> 03:50:26,560
And then I might take like the 23rd just like off just so I can like get my bearings,

1927
03:50:26,560 --> 03:50:31,560
but I might do a gorilla that day if I feel good enough.

1928
03:50:32,560 --> 03:50:40,560
But yeah, I just want to keep you guys posted because you know, I like to keep you guys posted.

1929
03:50:40,560 --> 03:50:41,560
Yeah, I'm going to doll you up.

1930
03:50:41,560 --> 03:50:46,560
I'm going to like torture you and be like, I need to practice makeup makeup skills for like prom.

1931
03:50:46,560 --> 03:50:48,560
So sit down and you guys can't move.

1932
03:50:48,560 --> 03:50:52,560
And then I'm just going to like be doing a bunch of shit to you.

1933
03:50:52,560 --> 03:50:53,560
Yeah, you're my baby doll.

1934
03:50:53,560 --> 03:50:55,560
I'm going to start calling you baby doll.

1935
03:50:55,560 --> 03:50:57,560
Hey, baby doll.

1936
03:50:57,560 --> 03:50:59,560
Hello, honey.

1937
03:50:59,560 --> 03:51:01,560
Hello, my baby doll.

1938
03:51:01,560 --> 03:51:03,560
I can't wait to play with you and break you.

1939
03:51:19,560 --> 03:51:21,560
Hey, God, I hear your phones.

1940
03:51:24,560 --> 03:51:26,560
I mean, this little sister she views big sis.

1941
03:51:26,560 --> 03:51:27,560
Exactly.

1942
03:51:27,560 --> 03:51:28,560
Exactly.

1943
03:51:29,560 --> 03:51:36,560
I am your, um, Oni.

1944
03:51:36,560 --> 03:51:37,560
Oni?

1945
03:51:37,560 --> 03:51:39,560
I forget the honor effect pronunciation.

1946
03:51:39,560 --> 03:51:42,560
You guys know your Bible is acting up.

1947
03:51:42,560 --> 03:51:45,560
You should probably smack it down.

1948
03:51:47,560 --> 03:51:48,560
My hot woman.

1949
03:51:48,560 --> 03:51:50,560
You can't keep doing this to me.

1950
03:51:50,560 --> 03:51:51,560
I'm going to die.

1951
03:51:52,560 --> 03:51:54,560
Oni, son.

1952
03:51:54,560 --> 03:51:56,560
Oni, son.

1953
03:51:57,560 --> 03:51:58,560
Well darn too.

1954
03:51:58,560 --> 03:52:00,560
And I'll be your Oni-san.

1955
03:52:00,560 --> 03:52:02,560
Emo-shi-mo-shi.

1956
03:52:02,560 --> 03:52:03,560
I just think of that one tick.

1957
03:52:03,560 --> 03:52:09,560
That girl who speaks like fluent Japanese when she does it all on a southern accent as a joke.

1958
03:52:09,560 --> 03:52:12,560
Arigata gozaimasu.

1959
03:52:12,560 --> 03:52:14,560
Itadakimasu.

1960
03:52:14,560 --> 03:52:15,560
Sue.

1961
03:52:15,560 --> 03:52:20,560
Shibine-chan.

1962
03:52:25,560 --> 03:52:26,560
It sounded like Callie.

1963
03:52:26,560 --> 03:52:28,560
I've gotten that before.

1964
03:52:41,560 --> 03:52:44,560
If you don't come back speaking...

1965
03:52:44,560 --> 03:52:46,560
I don't know what that means.

1966
03:52:49,560 --> 03:52:51,560
Go-mana-sorry.

1967
03:52:51,560 --> 03:52:53,560
That's one of my favorite like off-handed things.

1968
03:52:56,560 --> 03:52:58,560
Yeah, I'm pretty accurate when I mimic you guys.

1969
03:52:58,560 --> 03:53:00,560
Go-mana-sorry.

1970
03:53:00,560 --> 03:53:01,560
Sorry.

1971
03:53:01,560 --> 03:53:02,560
Am I Canadian?

1972
03:53:03,560 --> 03:53:04,560
Sorry.

1973
03:53:04,560 --> 03:53:05,560
Sorry.

1974
03:53:05,560 --> 03:53:06,560
Off the bed.

1975
03:53:06,560 --> 03:53:09,560
Thanks for watching your evening with my comedy and entertainment personality.

1976
03:53:09,560 --> 03:53:10,560
Thank you.

1977
03:53:10,560 --> 03:53:11,560
Have a good one.

1978
03:53:11,560 --> 03:53:12,560
Thanks for stopping by.

1979
03:53:13,560 --> 03:53:20,560
I always like, I think, I think I genuinely like seeing people from the other girls,

1980
03:53:20,560 --> 03:53:24,560
um, whatchamacallits, uh, fanbases.

1981
03:53:24,560 --> 03:53:27,560
And because I'm just like, I'm glad that you can also enjoy me too.

1982
03:53:27,560 --> 03:53:29,560
Like I might not be your Oshi, but you're like, you're still like,

1983
03:53:29,560 --> 03:53:32,560
when your Oshi's not on, you can just be like,

1984
03:53:32,560 --> 03:53:34,560
you know what, I'm gonna hang out with my bro today.

1985
03:53:37,560 --> 03:53:39,560
Okay, yeah, so that just continues.

1986
03:53:39,560 --> 03:53:40,560
It never ends.

1987
03:53:40,560 --> 03:53:41,560
It never ends.

1988
03:53:43,560 --> 03:53:44,560
Got home from work.

1989
03:53:44,560 --> 03:53:45,560
She's still straight.

1990
03:53:45,560 --> 03:53:46,560
You guys know I never stop.

1991
03:53:46,560 --> 03:53:49,560
Japanese and singing classes for madam.

1992
03:53:51,560 --> 03:53:52,560
She be my bro-shi.

1993
03:53:52,560 --> 03:53:55,560
I love bro-shi.

1994
03:53:55,560 --> 03:53:57,560
That's actually awesome.

1995
03:53:57,560 --> 03:53:58,560
I'll be your bro-shi.

1996
03:54:05,560 --> 03:54:06,560
That's funny.

1997
03:54:06,560 --> 03:54:08,560
I'll be your bro-shi.

1998
03:54:09,560 --> 03:54:19,560
I like how the thing that I was initially doing,

1999
03:54:19,560 --> 03:54:23,560
which is reading up my like personal writings when I was a teenager,

2000
03:54:23,560 --> 03:54:25,560
I just never looked to find the one I want,

2001
03:54:25,560 --> 03:54:30,560
because I wanted to show you the actual like wolf one that I have written

2002
03:54:30,560 --> 03:54:33,560
about my Oshi Cassander.

2003
03:54:33,560 --> 03:54:36,560
He was a beautiful white wolf.

2004
03:54:37,560 --> 03:54:42,560
And he was killed by his own brother like Mufasa Scar style.

2005
03:54:42,560 --> 03:54:44,560
Kami bro-shi.

2006
03:54:46,560 --> 03:54:48,560
I was Cassander with a C.

2007
03:54:50,560 --> 03:54:56,560
I would often get a lot of my names inspired by Greek mythology,

2008
03:54:56,560 --> 03:54:57,560
or just Greek.

2009
03:54:59,560 --> 03:55:04,560
Or even like William Shakespeare characters.

2010
03:55:04,560 --> 03:55:06,560
Yeah, he got Mufasa.

2011
03:55:08,560 --> 03:55:10,560
Wait, let me see if I can find it.

2012
03:55:10,560 --> 03:55:12,560
I wonder if I just look up Cassander.

2013
03:55:35,560 --> 03:55:37,560
No, that's not it.

2014
03:56:01,560 --> 03:56:03,560
Nope, nope, nope.

2015
03:56:05,560 --> 03:56:07,560
And maybe it wasn't, I didn't save it.

2016
03:56:07,560 --> 03:56:08,560
That's a bummer.

2017
03:56:22,560 --> 03:56:24,560
I thought it would have been underdraft.

2018
03:56:25,560 --> 03:56:26,560
No.

2019
03:56:27,560 --> 03:56:31,560
Arner, clary, not the water.

2020
03:56:32,560 --> 03:56:33,560
Search the archive.

2021
03:56:45,560 --> 03:56:46,560
RIP.

2022
03:56:48,560 --> 03:56:50,560
Writing stream to make up for it?

2023
03:56:50,560 --> 03:56:51,560
No, I'm not the same.

2024
03:56:51,560 --> 03:56:54,560
Like actually, I was an okay writer when I was younger.

2025
03:56:54,560 --> 03:56:57,560
I don't, I haven't written in such a long time.

2026
03:56:57,560 --> 03:56:59,560
Like actively.

2027
03:57:02,560 --> 03:57:08,560
Oh man, I must be lost on one of my old computers.

2028
03:57:13,560 --> 03:57:15,560
Oh my god, Reyna.

2029
03:57:16,560 --> 03:57:17,560
Relax, lady.

2030
03:57:18,560 --> 03:57:21,560
You need to, oh my god.

2031
03:57:21,560 --> 03:57:24,560
She just like threw herself on my desk.

2032
03:57:27,560 --> 03:57:29,560
My god, woman.

2033
03:57:32,560 --> 03:57:35,560
Creative writing memory stream.

2034
03:57:39,560 --> 03:57:41,560
I mean, I'm sorry that she knows you're leaving, I know.

2035
03:57:41,560 --> 03:57:45,560
I just don't want her to hurt herself because sometimes she just throws herself on my desk

2036
03:57:45,560 --> 03:57:50,560
and then she trips over my go XLR and my keyboard and I'm like, no, lady.

2037
03:57:52,560 --> 03:57:56,560
Yeah, Strani was telling me that you guys liked the script writing stream.

2038
03:57:57,560 --> 03:58:03,560
I'm a little self-conscious about my writing, which is why I haven't written any of my own scripts yet.

2039
03:58:07,560 --> 03:58:14,560
Ellie showed you what I wrote when I was much younger because I have the excuse to say I was much younger

2040
03:58:14,560 --> 03:58:16,560
because it's that cringy.

2041
03:58:20,560 --> 03:58:22,560
She lives with her cast, not the other way around.

2042
03:58:27,560 --> 03:58:28,560
What?

2043
03:58:29,560 --> 03:58:35,560
These rice cakes taste like TV static and I started barfing up 50 colds.

2044
03:58:37,560 --> 03:58:41,560
I know, yeah, I was wondering if I should write my own script.

2045
03:58:41,560 --> 03:58:48,560
I just don't like, I'm not, I don't, I write, I don't write scripts.

2046
03:58:50,560 --> 03:58:53,560
Like I could probably write a story.

2047
03:58:54,560 --> 03:59:02,560
Like I can write like amazing smut for you if you want of me and Harum or me and insert your name,

2048
03:59:02,560 --> 03:59:04,560
like a fanfiction of us together.

2049
03:59:04,560 --> 03:59:06,560
I can do that very easily.

2050
03:59:06,560 --> 03:59:09,560
But like writing, I've never, did I write it?

2051
03:59:09,560 --> 03:59:11,560
Did I write a script in theater class?

2052
03:59:11,560 --> 03:59:14,560
I did like one theater class when I was younger.

2053
03:59:14,560 --> 03:59:16,560
I can't remember if I wrote a script though.

2054
03:59:16,560 --> 03:59:17,560
Might have.

2055
03:59:18,560 --> 03:59:20,560
Haven't all jacked it out for you.

2056
03:59:20,560 --> 03:59:21,560
Yeah.

2057
03:59:21,560 --> 03:59:27,560
But it's like, but then I like, again, I've read like we have a script writer and then like

2058
03:59:27,560 --> 03:59:35,560
Shrani's are in scripts and I've seen in fact, I have to record a script for Emmy for a special

2059
03:59:35,560 --> 03:59:37,560
little treat that she wants to record together.

2060
03:59:40,560 --> 03:59:46,560
But and like, I'm like, I think I could, it might not be as good, but it would just be like,

2061
03:59:46,560 --> 03:59:47,560
at least a starting point.

2062
03:59:47,560 --> 03:59:51,560
And then you guys could like, obviously like give me a critique and examples.

2063
03:59:51,560 --> 03:59:58,560
So yeah, maybe when I come back, I want to do, in fact, I want to make my schedule right now for when I come back.

2064
04:00:00,560 --> 04:00:02,560
Because I want to do Hades.

2065
04:00:04,560 --> 04:00:06,560
Let's do Wednesday.

2066
04:00:06,560 --> 04:00:08,560
We'll do because I usually do member Mondays.

2067
04:00:08,560 --> 04:00:09,560
So we'll do Wednesday.

2068
04:00:09,560 --> 04:00:11,560
I'll do the members stream.

2069
04:00:16,560 --> 04:00:27,560
I'll do script writing.

2070
04:00:27,560 --> 04:00:29,560
Remember stream.

2071
04:00:29,560 --> 04:00:30,560
I want to play.

2072
04:00:30,560 --> 04:00:33,560
I put the wrong time.

2073
04:00:33,560 --> 04:00:34,560
Or p.m.

2074
04:00:39,560 --> 04:00:43,560
I also have to make time to hang out with Tomo.

2075
04:00:46,560 --> 04:00:50,560
Then I have a collab with DEMPA coming up.

2076
04:00:50,560 --> 04:00:52,560
I have so much shit to do guys.

2077
04:00:52,560 --> 04:00:54,560
I'm so busy.

2078
04:00:54,560 --> 04:00:56,560
And then I still want it when I come back.

2079
04:00:56,560 --> 04:01:02,560
I want to record my next two months of audios for Patreon.

2080
04:01:02,560 --> 04:01:06,560
So I'm going to be a busy fucking bee, but I like it though.

2081
04:01:06,560 --> 04:01:10,560
It keeps me busy because otherwise I just lay around and that's not fun.

2082
04:01:11,560 --> 04:01:14,560
Let's see.

2083
04:01:14,560 --> 04:01:17,560
I take Sundays off so I can work on other stuff.

2084
04:01:17,560 --> 04:01:19,560
So I'm not going to do anything on Sunday.

2085
04:01:22,560 --> 04:01:24,560
What day did I say with Tomo that I would hang out?

2086
04:01:24,560 --> 04:01:26,560
Let me look at my camera.

2087
04:01:29,560 --> 04:01:36,560
I just looked at Discord for the first time in a while and I'm laughing because Imi sent a meme.

2088
04:01:37,560 --> 04:01:40,560
I said, I must be Sonic the way I'm hedging my hog.

2089
04:01:42,560 --> 04:01:44,560
I fucking love her so much.

2090
04:01:44,560 --> 04:01:47,560
Why is she so funny for no reason?

2091
04:01:52,560 --> 04:01:55,560
Tomo are you still here about looking at the chat?

2092
04:01:55,560 --> 04:01:57,560
No, I think she disappeared.

2093
04:01:57,560 --> 04:01:59,560
I don't know if she's streaming or anything.

2094
04:02:06,560 --> 04:02:08,560
I don't know.

2095
04:02:15,560 --> 04:02:19,560
Okay, I might have to be the week after that I do want the Tomo because I don't.

2096
04:02:19,560 --> 04:02:22,560
I don't think we actually sell alone a day.

2097
04:02:27,560 --> 04:02:29,560
Okay, I'll do Hades on Thursday.

2098
04:02:32,560 --> 04:02:34,560
Hades.

2099
04:02:36,560 --> 04:02:38,560
Wait, no, I want to do the member stream.

2100
04:02:38,560 --> 04:02:40,560
Discard.

2101
04:02:40,560 --> 04:02:42,560
No, I want to do karaoke really bad for real.

2102
04:02:50,560 --> 04:02:52,560
Should I do it?

2103
04:02:52,560 --> 04:02:54,560
I'll ask you guys.

2104
04:02:56,560 --> 04:03:03,560
If you and only if you're a member answer this question, would you prefer it be an archive?

2105
04:03:03,560 --> 04:03:12,560
Because like what sucks about an unarchived karaoke member stream is that not all members might be able to see it.

2106
04:03:16,560 --> 04:03:19,560
So I'm debating if that's a good idea.

2107
04:03:26,560 --> 04:03:29,560
Because I don't want could always do a rebroadcast.

2108
04:03:34,560 --> 04:03:37,560
Anyway, Patreon members could see no.

2109
04:03:40,560 --> 04:03:43,560
There's Patreon content and there's YouTube content.

2110
04:03:43,560 --> 04:03:46,560
They are two separate entities, but I appreciate if you support me on one.

2111
04:03:46,560 --> 04:03:49,560
And if you can't support me on the other, that is fine.

2112
04:03:51,560 --> 04:03:53,560
But also a girl got to eat.

2113
04:03:56,560 --> 04:03:58,560
I just can't hit.

2114
04:03:58,560 --> 04:04:06,560
Like there's also there has to be a reason why you want to become a member, you know, and it's for the fun, cool stuff, member stuff.

2115
04:04:07,560 --> 04:04:10,560
Re-broadcasting, I don't know what that means.

2116
04:04:11,560 --> 04:04:13,560
Oh, I'm getting cramps and it hurts.

2117
04:04:28,560 --> 04:04:50,560
You just rebroadcast of the stream, but like stream you stream the unarchived pod.

2118
04:04:52,560 --> 04:04:57,560
Oh, oh, okay.

2119
04:04:58,560 --> 04:05:00,560
No, yeah, that's actually a good idea.

2120
04:05:00,560 --> 04:05:01,560
That's what Narissa does.

2121
04:05:01,560 --> 04:05:03,560
Okay, then I'm going to copy Narissa.

2122
04:05:04,560 --> 04:05:07,560
That's smart because then I can just stream and record.

2123
04:05:09,560 --> 04:05:12,560
I need to get a new SSD because I'm running out of space.

2124
04:05:12,560 --> 04:05:19,560
I have like maybe 300 gigabytes left and I have like so many fucking because no, you know what I need to fucking do?

2125
04:05:19,560 --> 04:05:22,560
I need an uninstall overwatch and fucking call of duty.

2126
04:05:23,560 --> 04:05:28,560
That's what I needed to uninstall and save up like 600 gigabytes from that alone.

2127
04:05:30,560 --> 04:05:32,560
The 1080, you mean my 1070?

2128
04:05:36,560 --> 04:05:41,560
I like I'll probably I'll probably get a new PC when I do a donathon.

2129
04:05:41,560 --> 04:05:43,560
Like I'll probably make the proceeds go to that.

2130
04:05:44,560 --> 04:05:48,560
Actually, I don't really know because like my PC is fine.

2131
04:05:48,560 --> 04:05:50,560
It's not like dying.

2132
04:05:50,560 --> 04:05:57,560
I just have to uninstall stuff because I'm like, I know a portion of donathon proceeds.

2133
04:05:57,560 --> 04:06:10,560
I'm definitely going to put towards like paying off FIA and Reyna's medical bills and then the rest I'll probably maybe like 3D model because I really want a 3D model really bad.

2134
04:06:10,560 --> 04:06:11,560
It's funny.

2135
04:06:11,560 --> 04:06:18,560
I used to like hate 3D models and then I just realized how much I want one to single like people what people do with 3D models.

2136
04:06:20,560 --> 04:06:22,560
So work expense.

2137
04:06:27,560 --> 04:06:28,560
Yeah, I don't know.

2138
04:06:31,560 --> 04:06:32,560
Oh, yeah.

2139
04:06:32,560 --> 04:06:33,560
A 40 series to be cheaper.

2140
04:06:33,560 --> 04:06:34,560
That's a good point.

2141
04:06:34,560 --> 04:06:36,560
If you upgrade the 1070 or 100%, I know.

2142
04:06:36,560 --> 04:06:37,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2143
04:06:37,560 --> 04:06:40,560
I think I'm trying to think what my power supply is.

2144
04:06:44,560 --> 04:06:45,560
What the fuck?

2145
04:06:45,560 --> 04:06:47,560
Again, I built this like so long ago.

2146
04:06:47,560 --> 04:06:50,560
I'll have to build a whole new fucking PC and I'm not looking forward to it.

2147
04:06:50,560 --> 04:06:51,560
I'll be honest with you.

2148
04:06:51,560 --> 04:06:57,560
I might just buy a pre-build because I just I don't have the patience to try to put a PC together again.

2149
04:06:57,560 --> 04:06:59,560
I used to love doing it because I did it very often.

2150
04:06:59,560 --> 04:07:02,560
I would my dad and I used to work for him.

2151
04:07:02,560 --> 04:07:07,560
He would just give me PCs to build and unbuild and fix and update and stuff.

2152
04:07:11,560 --> 04:07:12,560
But I just don't feel like doing that.

2153
04:07:16,560 --> 04:07:20,560
I think I have a 700 watt power supply.

2154
04:07:20,560 --> 04:07:25,560
I think I have a maybe kind of find that my email.

2155
04:07:29,560 --> 04:07:31,560
Let me see if I...

2156
04:07:47,560 --> 04:07:53,560
I think I have a 700 watt gold something power supply.

2157
04:07:53,560 --> 04:07:54,560
7050 at zero.

2158
04:07:54,560 --> 04:07:55,560
Okay.

2159
04:07:55,560 --> 04:07:58,560
So then I probably, yeah, I don't think I don't have a 750.

2160
04:07:58,560 --> 04:08:01,560
I thought I had a 1000 watt, but I don't.

2161
04:08:18,560 --> 04:08:19,560
How...

2162
04:08:20,560 --> 04:08:21,560
What the fuck?

2163
04:08:21,560 --> 04:08:27,560
I look up PC part picker to see if I like took a screenshot of something and I'm getting all these emails of all this role plays that I did.

2164
04:08:27,560 --> 04:08:29,560
That doesn't make any sense how these are coming up.

2165
04:08:35,560 --> 04:08:36,560
What the fuck?

2166
04:08:38,560 --> 04:08:39,560
Oops.

2167
04:08:57,560 --> 04:08:58,560
Sorry.

2168
04:09:15,560 --> 04:09:17,560
Sorry, I mislike distracted reading stuff that I wrote when I was younger.

2169
04:09:17,560 --> 04:09:18,560
I'm sorry.

2170
04:09:18,560 --> 04:09:19,560
I just told her like disassociating.

2171
04:09:19,560 --> 04:09:22,560
Cause I was like, oh, interesting.

2172
04:09:22,560 --> 04:09:30,720
interesting so it was like some fanfic about the cuz I remember I told you I

2173
04:09:30,720 --> 04:09:37,080
don't know if you guys recall I um did are you like made OCs for like soul eater

2174
04:09:37,080 --> 04:09:42,840
so it was like a soul eater fanfic so I was like oh fascinating

2175
04:09:42,840 --> 04:09:54,760
I can't find shit I'm so pissed right now I can't even think straight cuz

2176
04:09:54,760 --> 04:10:00,860
these cramps are fucking hurting me so fucking bad it just hit me all of a

2177
04:10:00,860 --> 04:10:04,280
sudden yeah the solid it's like I know I might just like sit with myself when

2178
04:10:04,280 --> 04:10:07,920
I'm like when I'm like bored at my grandparents just my iPad and just be

2179
04:10:07,920 --> 04:10:13,680
like fascinating let's read your shit I remember you said you made the dudes bang

2180
04:10:13,680 --> 04:10:20,040
each other a lot I definitely did I couldn't find anything of that though

2181
04:10:20,040 --> 04:10:24,760
although there was like a saved file that's a schmutz stuff but I didn't

2182
04:10:24,760 --> 04:10:32,760
look at it oh yeah I love soul eater um pre-built is fine make sure the parts oh

2183
04:10:32,760 --> 04:10:38,400
yeah no like the thing is it's so much better to not buy pre-built because when

2184
04:10:38,400 --> 04:10:42,600
you build it yourself you can really get the parts at better prices because they

2185
04:10:42,600 --> 04:10:46,560
usually just overinflate their fucking part like the computer prices so I'm

2186
04:10:46,560 --> 04:10:51,600
probably gonna end up cuz like I remember management told me how much

2187
04:10:51,600 --> 04:10:56,280
Azura's computer was I was like there's no way you needed to spend that much

2188
04:10:56,280 --> 04:11:00,600
money on her computer cuz I could have built her a way better computer for a

2189
04:11:00,640 --> 04:11:08,640
fraction of the price um but PC building stream that'd be funny I think I I did do

2190
04:11:08,640 --> 04:11:14,080
that before I did it back when I was a flush streamer I did a PC building

2191
04:11:14,080 --> 04:11:21,720
stream on like um I forget it's not ready to be fun I don't think I would ever do

2192
04:11:21,720 --> 04:11:28,920
that just because of copyright issues you have to understand that I'm very

2193
04:11:29,000 --> 04:11:36,760
limited in what I can do without getting caught by YouTube just to be realistic

2194
04:11:36,760 --> 04:11:47,000
um I think I might have to get off cuz I'm in a lot of pain right now I love

2195
04:11:47,000 --> 04:11:50,360
building PCs I want to build one of them already I used to definitely have that

2196
04:11:50,360 --> 04:11:55,600
like fervorant passion for building PCs but now I'm just like I see it as more of

2197
04:11:55,600 --> 04:12:03,320
a chore because then I gotta make sure everything's good I'm also traumatized

2198
04:12:03,320 --> 04:12:08,640
because the last time I had to build my PC it was because I couldn't remember if

2199
04:12:08,640 --> 04:12:12,520
it was Rena or Sole through open my case fan and shorted out my motherboard in

2200
04:12:12,520 --> 04:12:15,640
my graphics card so I had to rebuild it and buy a lot of new parts and I was

2201
04:12:15,640 --> 04:12:20,280
crying and bawling my eyes out for days because it was so much money because I

2202
04:12:20,280 --> 04:12:28,360
had spent I'd saved the money I'd sold stuff and I remember it was so fucked

2203
04:12:28,360 --> 04:12:33,960
because my mom told me I think I couldn't remember if she told me it was

2204
04:12:33,960 --> 04:12:41,240
Rena and it was Sole if it was Sole and she told me it was Rena and she had

2205
04:12:41,240 --> 04:12:48,000
apparently known one of them had thrown up in my fan and heard it but didn't

2206
04:12:48,000 --> 04:12:51,120
stop me when I turned on the computer because I could have probably like

2207
04:12:51,120 --> 04:12:54,960
cleaned them off with like alcohol and like wiped it and like made sure

2208
04:12:54,960 --> 04:12:59,360
everything was good she never told me so I turned on my computer and it fucking

2209
04:12:59,360 --> 04:13:04,680
shorted it are you gonna be rich or free of your past self yeah I was like when I

2210
04:13:04,680 --> 04:13:09,840
was working like a really shitty job actually no it wasn't a shitty job at

2211
04:13:09,840 --> 04:13:13,360
all I was a fine job I was definitely underpaid but you know what can you

2212
04:13:13,360 --> 04:13:21,600
expect when you're like 15 yeah but I was yeah I was they threw up in the case

2213
04:13:21,600 --> 04:13:27,480
fan because the case fan was on top because Rena would like and Sole would

2214
04:13:27,480 --> 04:13:33,680
like to they like to lay on my fucking PC because they liked the heat that came

2215
04:13:33,680 --> 04:13:42,160
off of it now on my desk they can't do that because there's a rack there where

2216
04:13:42,160 --> 04:13:47,640
I usually put my some of my peripherals like at my controller and stuff and some

2217
04:13:47,640 --> 04:13:54,480
other peripheral stuff like wires and like all like my gloves for like

2218
04:13:54,480 --> 04:14:00,960
handcams and stuff and so they can't do that because then like I also had so much

2219
04:14:00,960 --> 04:14:09,320
cat hair and Mike like I had a constantly blow air through it when Rena and Sole

2220
04:14:09,320 --> 04:14:12,840
would sit on it because they just a cat hair was just accumulating crazy and

2221
04:14:12,840 --> 04:14:17,920
that's why I ended up getting a case that cuz like my case initially wasn't

2222
04:14:17,920 --> 04:14:22,240
that clear you couldn't see like the inner and the inner parts of it so like

2223
04:14:22,240 --> 04:14:25,760
every once in a while I have to open up my computer to see if it was okay and

2224
04:14:25,760 --> 04:14:36,600
then I would just see a shit on a cat hair and I was like oh yeah but yeah I'm

2225
04:14:36,600 --> 04:14:44,280
like I'm still don't know what plans will be for the donothon again that's far

2226
04:14:44,280 --> 04:14:48,640
ahead but it feels like it's approaching fast to a more months until my

2227
04:14:48,640 --> 04:14:54,720
birthday it's quite nerve-wracking I usually celebrate my birthday alone

2228
04:14:54,720 --> 04:15:01,120
usually don't celebrate it at all to be honest with you so it'll be nice to spend

2229
04:15:01,120 --> 04:15:11,720
it with you guys let's have a fun time cuz yeah HD app is great if you are fuel

2230
04:15:11,720 --> 04:15:20,760
yeah no I know I know my limits I'll get off when I want to

2231
04:15:20,760 --> 04:15:25,120
spoil you on that day what do you want for your b-day I just want you guys to

2232
04:15:25,120 --> 04:15:30,200

2438
04:39:09,360 --> 04:39:15,000

2439
04:39:15,000 --> 04:39:20,600
looking through my clips to send to stronti and they're just one person who

2440
04:39:20,600 --> 04:39:25,720
just clips literally everything I do and I have to go through everything and I'm

2441
04:39:25,720 --> 04:39:32,960
like holy shit thank god though cuz I appreciate all clippers where she bees

future stuff question about clips you want edited ones the ones from YouTube I

2444
04:39:42,720 --> 04:39:50,480
prefer like I prefer edited ones but again that's work that you're doing so if

2445
04:39:50,480 --> 04:39:54,080
you want to do it then that's great but if you don't if you just want to clip

2446
04:39:54,120 --> 04:39:58,200
like something you thought was funny I look I go through my clips and I send

2447
04:39:58,200 --> 04:40:01,560
them to the clippers so like if you wanted you extra work it's up to you you

2448

2455
04:40:59,160 --> 04:41:04,540

2456

2459
04:41:24,580 --> 04:41:28,460
do like end up in frame not like my face or anything but just like my arm or

2460
04:41:28,460 --> 04:41:36,820

2469
04:42:32,020 --> 04:42:41,620
the audacity you did that on purpose I'm not giving you I'm not giving you the

2470
04:42:41,900 --> 04:42:50,460
pleasure of no no go away go away you're trying to get a rise out of me it's

2471
04:42:50,460 --> 04:42:55,780
not working oh by the way hold on a second I needed I wanted to say this on

2472
04:42:55,780 --> 04:43:05,660
stream rather than say it in a tweet so when I was streaming with mercy the

2473
04:43:05,660 --> 04:43:14,980
other day do not on her stream or any of the girls' stream I don't care if you

2474
04:43:14,980 --> 04:43:22,740
do it on mine I don't give a shit don't super chat her and then say someone

2475
04:43:22,740 --> 04:43:30,140
else is your oh she if you were there you probably saw us all pause because we

2476
04:43:30,140 --> 04:43:35,620
were just like who the fuck does that but like to that person they probably

2477
04:43:35,620 --> 04:43:45,900
were fine with it but it's just poor etiquette and I was very irritated on

2478
04:43:45,900 --> 04:43:52,260
behalf of her if you do it in mine I don't care but mercy has explicitly said

2479
04:43:52,260 --> 04:43:55,620
before that it makes her uncomfortable when people do stuff like that and then

2480
04:43:55,620 --> 04:44:02,380
this person goes ahead and do it don't fucking do that also I might need to add

2481
04:44:02,380 --> 04:44:05,020
a rule to stop making chat about yourself because people have been doing

2482
04:44:05,020 --> 04:44:12,660
that lately and I'm just like um actually you're here to watch me or the

2483
04:44:12,660 --> 04:44:15,180
person that I'm streaming with stop making the chat about yourself you're

2484
04:44:15,180 --> 04:44:18,100
not a chat celebrity this is why we don't have mods that you can see because

2485
04:44:18,100 --> 04:44:21,660
they're gonna be try to become chat celebrities

2486
04:44:22,700 --> 04:44:29,380
mods peck him yeah and like I appreciate this person because they do do

2487
04:44:29,420 --> 04:44:38,100
Supas on my stream and they like whatever but it is if it is poor etiquette to

2488
04:44:38,100 --> 04:44:46,300
talk about someone who is not present and say that they are your oh she because

2489
04:44:46,300 --> 04:44:50,420
that was after this is when the person was gone and we were no longer

2490
04:44:50,420 --> 04:44:54,700
collabing with this person and it was just being mercy and we were shooting

2491
04:44:54,740 --> 04:45:02,660
shit that this happened and I did not like that at all I was very irritated on

2492
04:45:02,660 --> 04:45:11,460
behalf of mercy I'm very protective of my girls and if you hurt their feelings I

2493
04:45:11,460 --> 04:45:18,780
will fucking come for you I swear to God I will rip your face off and I know like

2494
04:45:18,780 --> 04:45:25,420
again it was innocent they probably didn't know but it's just such in such

2495
04:45:25,420 --> 04:45:33,620
poor tastes and I just wanted to say something about that but yeah if you if

2496
04:45:33,620 --> 04:45:42,420
you do Supas like to make stuff about yourself like oh this is happening to

2497
04:45:42,420 --> 04:45:57,060
me or like this I don't I'm sorry but do you you don't use Supa as a medium to

2498
04:45:57,060 --> 04:46:00,940
make a conversation about you we're all here to have fun we're all here to

2499
04:46:00,940 --> 04:46:07,700
escape from life we yeah I don't appreciate attention see behavior and

2500
04:46:07,700 --> 04:46:16,860
donations I'm sorry but I don't no yeah but you guys know what I'll call you out

2501
04:46:16,860 --> 04:46:24,860
yeah you guys know I'll call you out because I'm very blunt I'll probably do

2502
04:46:24,860 --> 04:46:32,900
a little bit more nicer than what I'm doing now but yeah but yeah you guys

2503
04:46:32,900 --> 04:46:38,940
know that I'm I'm nice I have my moments where I'm very nice I'll be honest with

2504
04:46:38,940 --> 04:46:42,020
you and I've said this to the other girls I'm very thankful for the kayfabe

2505
04:46:42,020 --> 04:46:45,020
that I have because I feel like I can get away with telling you guys to stop

2506
04:46:45,020 --> 04:46:51,300
fucking doing something stupid when I tell you to whereas if like Azura did

2507
04:46:51,300 --> 04:46:55,180
that people would be like probably like so off-put by it but if it's me they're

2508
04:46:55,180 --> 04:47:02,540
just like oh she's just being she be she's the Dom you know whereas like Azura be

2509
04:47:02,540 --> 04:47:08,980
like I can't believe she on me I'm such a bad son to my mommy goat goddess or

2510
04:47:08,980 --> 04:47:21,140
like scrawny but I you I do this because also some of the girls just don't

2511
04:47:21,140 --> 04:47:26,380
have the courage to say stuff like this and I will be the big sister I will say

2512
04:47:26,380 --> 04:47:33,260
something because I again I am very protective of my gen mates they are my

2513
04:47:33,260 --> 04:47:36,700
sisters when I call them my sisters they are my sisters I was birthed from

2514
04:47:36,700 --> 04:47:42,380
scrawny's loins or she laid an egg I don't fucking know whatever cul-de-fiche do

2515
04:47:42,380 --> 04:47:56,180
I put them I put them before myself I will protect their sanity and their

2516
04:47:56,540 --> 04:48:01,460
mental before my own because I care about them that much the Lord gets a little

2517
04:48:01,460 --> 04:48:05,180
weird yeah people can't correct themselves they never told what's wrong

2518
04:48:05,180 --> 04:48:09,300
that's why like I'll tell you guys like what I appreciate about harem what I

2519
04:48:09,300 --> 04:48:12,100
appreciate about you guys is that you guys are very receptive to feedback and

2520
04:48:12,100 --> 04:48:16,900
then again I am also I think I put it in a better way because I'm very real with

2521
04:48:16,900 --> 04:48:23,340
you guys I hope so angry she be as hot but scary at the same time you guys

2522
04:48:23,380 --> 04:48:30,900
actually haven't seen me actually mad yet if you saw me actually mad you'd

2523
04:48:30,900 --> 04:48:40,460
probably unsubscribe actually no no that that would not actually was never

2524
04:48:40,460 --> 04:48:46,300
streamed though the one time when I raged and I broke my headset I think would

2525
04:48:46,300 --> 04:48:52,940
have frightened some people she protects you protect but mostly importantly

2526
04:48:52,940 --> 04:48:58,140
she got their back exactly no you guys you guys are like you guys are very

2527
04:48:58,140 --> 04:49:00,860
receptive like when I like when I was getting a lot of like stuff in my

2528
04:49:00,860 --> 04:49:03,980
maros or this was happening or that was happening I'd be like hey guys what the

2529
04:49:03,980 --> 04:49:07,140
fuck's going on you guys can't do this and then they're just like oh shit okay

2530
04:49:07,140 --> 04:49:11,780

2531
04:49:11,780 --> 04:49:14,140
that's whatever

2532
04:49:14,460 --> 04:49:23,220
but also I just I say stuff and I put there are rules in place to protect

2533
04:49:23,220 --> 04:49:26,900
everyone as well don't forget that I want to make sure that everyone is having a

2534
04:49:26,900 --> 04:49:39,180
good time because after the girls then I put you there and then myself because I

2535
04:49:39,180 --> 04:49:43,300
am here to entertain I'm here to make you feel good I'm here to have you

2536
04:49:43,300 --> 04:49:50,860
heck you have a good time you come to my streams to have fun you come to my

2537
04:49:50,860 --> 04:50:00,260
streams for an escape and I will provide as such as I do care about you I do love

2538
04:50:00,260 --> 04:50:06,300
you all and I wouldn't be you know where I am without you so I say this like

2539
04:50:06,300 --> 04:50:09,900
every fucking stream that's because I just can't get over how thankful I am for

2540
04:50:09,900 --> 04:50:16,460
you guys but yeah a lot of my stuff is teasing anyways like I don't know I'm

2541
04:50:16,460 --> 04:50:20,380
just I'm just a very good actress you guys can't tell if I'm well I just sound

2542
04:50:20,380 --> 04:50:28,180
like a server second guys can't tell if I'm really mad or not I can't I didn't

2543
04:50:28,180 --> 04:50:32,460
know a zur has a lisp and she was like explaining it to me and I'm like that I

2544
04:50:32,460 --> 04:50:37,020
think that's the only reason I can't do your voice is because I can't do the

2545
04:50:37,020 --> 04:50:43,260
lisp because I didn't notice she had one I'm just that oblivious I suppose I am a

2546
04:50:43,260 --> 04:50:51,140
Sarah to lay the fertility goddess

2547
04:50:52,580 --> 04:50:57,380
repetition doesn't make any less meaningful so I'm glad to hear it oh

2548
04:50:57,980 --> 04:51:03,060
so I guess you're an Amy Wednesday if I again I want to do a stream I want to do

2549
04:51:03,060 --> 04:51:08,900

2553
04:51:24,060 --> 04:51:33,980
little sister jump scare oh if you named your cat tongue eater instead

2554

04:52:03,340 --> 04:52:10,220
biggest she be fan I'm the biggest Amy fan I watch all the girls it's like it's

2559
04:52:10,220 --> 04:52:13,860
like what's funny for me it's like I'm also very picky about my vTubers that I

2560
04:52:13,860 --> 04:52:17,220
watch and I'll well if I'm not streaming I'll just watch the girl like I've I

2561
04:52:17,220 --> 04:52:21,420
seen the background so often when I'm doing stuff minus when she's like really

2562
04:52:21,420 --> 04:52:24,300
going hardcore with her dad is because then I'm like that's this isn't for me

2563
04:52:24,300 --> 04:52:32,140
this is for somebody else I am not the target demographic

2564
04:52:33,740 --> 04:52:39,420
I don't know that I don't like it but you know it's just not for me it's all

2565
04:52:39,420 --> 04:52:42,860
the convoluted strong e birth two girls and the reeflings are tough but she also

2566
04:52:42,860 --> 04:52:47,580
give birth to the reeflings it's fair it's very like America like it's very

2567

2801
05:21:59,540 --> 05:22:01,540
Hmm

2802
05:22:08,500 --> 05:22:10,500

What the heck is happening to my chat? Let me fix this

2804
05:22:16,900 --> 05:22:19,780
Bro, how do I get ads on my own videos? This is so funny me

2805
05:22:22,180 --> 05:22:24,180
I like have you guys another window

2806
05:22:27,060 --> 05:22:29,060
Grippers out my grippers are out

2807
05:22:30,260 --> 05:22:31,940
Slipping the line

2808
05:22:31,940 --> 05:22:36,500
Me if I was a cat she'd be as a divorce argument in the next room is

2809
05:22:37,220 --> 05:22:38,820
That'd be funny

2810
05:22:38,820 --> 05:22:42,180
And be popping up writing. I usually sometimes I'll set them to like balanced, but

2811
05:22:43,300 --> 05:22:46,980
Yeah, it's a little bit. I wish I could set them to like pre-rolls only

2812
05:22:47,940 --> 05:22:51,380
Because then you guys it would just get eaten by like the way that's what I like to do at twitch

2813
05:22:51,380 --> 05:22:55,860
Is because I can usually have the pre-rolls roll set and then I would just have them get like

2814
05:22:56,420 --> 05:23:02,500
You wouldn't miss anything because it would just be eaten by the um the waiting the starting soon screen

2815
05:23:05,220 --> 05:23:10,500
Getting that ad revenue for yourself girl boss activity again, I don't have a job. This is my job now

05:23:49,060 --> 05:23:51,060
So they're probably just playing

2826
05:23:53,780 --> 05:23:57,460
Well, I'm the alpha cat but then like rain is in charge, you know, she's my second

2827
05:23:58,100 --> 05:24:00,260
Command they're in their rebellious phase. Yeah

2828
05:24:01,380 --> 05:24:06,180
She's fucking his statham because he just was some boomy is uh

2829
05:24:06,740 --> 05:24:11,780
Boomy and fia just turned a year old because they're they're still little babies. They're still kittens in my eyes and raina's 14

2830
05:24:13,460 --> 05:24:15,620
So they they verse they uh

2831
05:24:16,500 --> 05:24:17,940
definitely

2832
05:24:18,260 --> 05:24:20,260
Tests their matriarch very often

2833
05:24:21,140 --> 05:24:22,820
but um

2834
05:24:22,820 --> 05:24:28,100
Raina really has warmed up to fia and I think cuz fia reminds her a lot of her sister soley

2835
05:24:28,180 --> 05:24:32,580
They have very similar personalities. So she'll often snuggle with fia. It's very cute

2836
05:24:34,420 --> 05:24:36,420
Um, but yeah, raina put some in their place

2837
05:24:37,780 --> 05:24:43,460
They're just it's so funny how like similar cats and dogs are a lot more similar than you think with like their hierarchal system

2838
05:24:44,660 --> 05:24:46,020
um

2839
05:24:46,020 --> 05:24:49,140
Yeah, they are little babies my little babies

2840
05:24:50,500 --> 05:24:53,220
I wanted raina to have a friend

2841
05:24:54,660 --> 05:24:58,820
Um, it's actually none of those spellings. It's rain with an a

2842
05:25:00,020 --> 05:25:01,860
um

2843
05:25:01,860 --> 05:25:05,300
I wanted raina to have a friend because I was um

2844
05:25:06,900 --> 05:25:11,220
Going back to work after working from home for six months. So I didn't want her to be alone

2845
05:25:12,100 --> 05:25:15,700
In a new apartment by herself. And so I got boomy

2846
05:25:15,860 --> 05:25:20,740
I never had a boy or like a male cat before because I was just like, oh, let me try getting a male cat

2847
05:25:20,820 --> 05:25:23,060
I shouldn't have done that. I should have just stayed with the female cat

2848
05:25:23,620 --> 05:25:29,220
Um, not that I wish I did to get boomy. I love boomy. He's my little son my little boy. Um,

2849
05:25:29,780 --> 05:25:32,260
But she fucking hated him

2850
05:25:32,900 --> 05:25:38,820
Hated him so much. I was I was like, I don't know if it was like and I did all the proper things

2851
05:25:38,900 --> 05:25:41,780
Like I made sure they're in separate rooms. They're in separate rooms for a long time

2852
05:25:41,860 --> 05:25:46,820
I would like move towels around so they could smell each other like how you properly introduce a cat

2853
05:25:47,540 --> 05:25:54,020
And she fucking hated him and she still does. Um, it's funny because boomy has the biggest crush on raina

2854
05:25:54,740 --> 05:25:57,460
100% he's just like give me some of that koo grass

2855
05:25:58,180 --> 05:26:00,180
because it'll like he'll

2856
05:26:00,420 --> 05:26:03,220
Koo at her to play like he'll like get real low and be like

2857
05:26:03,220 --> 05:26:05,220
Oh

2858
05:26:05,860 --> 05:26:08,900
And then raina would just like be like this is like walk away

2859
05:26:09,940 --> 05:26:13,540
Like he tries to like he doesn't do that to fia. He doesn't do that

2860
05:26:13,620 --> 05:26:18,980
He only does that to raina and it's so funny to me. Hi boomy speak of the devil. Hi. Here's your boy

2861
05:26:19,380 --> 05:26:22,580
What are you doing? You just sitting and watching me? Can I get a headbutt?

2862
05:26:23,540 --> 05:26:25,540
Oh

2863
05:26:26,580 --> 05:26:28,580
Um

2864
05:26:28,740 --> 05:26:32,420
He wants a woman who hates him for real. Yeah, um

2865
05:26:33,380 --> 05:26:35,860
But then like he and I always was worried

2866
05:26:36,820 --> 05:26:40,820
Uh because boomy is like so much bigger than raina and I'm like, oh crap

2867
05:26:40,900 --> 05:26:43,860
Is boomy gonna become like the dominant cat? But no, he's not

2868
05:26:44,740 --> 05:26:48,740
Raina still puts him in his place and boomy is such a pussy. Like he's scared

2869
05:26:49,460 --> 05:26:53,700
He's such a he's such a dick, but then he just gets like you will

2870
05:26:54,580 --> 05:26:58,100
Accidentally move too fast and he will sprint

2871
05:26:58,660 --> 05:27:03,460
Into my laundry room and hide behind my laundry machine and I'm just like bro

2872
05:27:03,620 --> 05:27:09,780
It's I literally accidentally knocked the remote off the couch onto the carpet. It wasn't a loud noise

2873
05:27:09,860 --> 05:27:11,860
It was like a like a little

2874
05:27:11,860 --> 05:27:13,860
Fump noise and he'll just freak out

2875
05:27:14,180 --> 05:27:16,180
Boomy is literally awesome

2876
05:27:17,300 --> 05:27:23,220
Um, that'll be some alter women and he just I don't know if you heard the noise he just made um

2877
05:27:23,940 --> 05:27:26,980
and then fias uh then since I realized that

2878
05:27:28,180 --> 05:27:34,740
It wasn't I was a little bit greedy in getting a kitten for raina because I thought it would be easier for her to like

2879
05:27:35,460 --> 05:27:39,780
Dominate which it still that was true, but I thought they would take to each other a lot better

2880
05:27:40,500 --> 05:27:42,180
um

2881
05:27:42,180 --> 05:27:45,700
But they didn't and I I think it's is because that boomy is male

2882
05:27:46,420 --> 05:27:51,060
Um, although he's not like intact or anything. He's fixed. But then I so I got fia

2883
05:27:51,860 --> 05:27:53,300
so like

2884
05:27:53,300 --> 05:27:55,300
Boomy would have a playmate

2885
05:27:55,780 --> 05:27:57,780
as a kitten that can match his energy

2886
05:27:58,580 --> 05:28:00,100
and um

2887
05:28:00,100 --> 05:28:04,660
Then rena would have like a female companion and then it's everything's perfect like

2888
05:28:06,260 --> 05:28:13,700
Yeah, rena loves snuggling with fia fia was so I was I made the joke so when rena was sick

2889
05:28:15,220 --> 05:28:20,820
I was like fia you better not live up to your name because fia comes from fia the deathbed companion

2890
05:28:21,620 --> 05:28:23,780
From elden ring because I love elden ring so much

2891
05:28:24,580 --> 05:28:28,340
and yeah, no expected kid unexpected kids. No, thank you and um

2892
05:28:29,860 --> 05:28:31,860
But in but fia was like

2893
05:28:33,620 --> 05:28:35,620
So close like she was

2894
05:28:35,620 --> 05:28:38,980
With rena constantly like she was snuggling her

2895
05:28:39,540 --> 05:28:42,260
She was making sure she was good. She was grooming her

2896
05:28:42,980 --> 05:28:47,460
And I was worried because I'm like, oh is this mean like it might be the end for rena. She's older

2897
05:28:47,620 --> 05:28:49,620
Like I had already mentally prepared for that

2898
05:28:49,940 --> 05:28:51,140
but no

2899
05:28:51,140 --> 05:28:57,860
Reina fucking bounce back into zoom in and whatever and they just they're like really close together if they're really cute. Um

2900
05:28:59,140 --> 05:29:02,580
Yes, they're playing elden ring tomorrow. Yeah speaking of um

2901
05:29:03,700 --> 05:29:08,260
And then yeah, I always call boomy and fia the twins. They're not actually related. Um

2902
05:29:08,980 --> 05:29:13,060
They came from different litters. I they're both rescues from

2903
05:29:13,700 --> 05:29:15,700
Mississippi from the south

2904
05:29:15,700 --> 05:29:21,060
I went to the same um rescuer who was this really nice lady and um

2905
05:29:23,380 --> 05:29:25,380
One of the uh

2906
05:29:25,380 --> 05:29:29,620
Fia's was the sweetest girl. She's like, I've never met a more snuggly cat in my life

2907
05:29:30,820 --> 05:29:34,100
Oh, she's pregnant at grandpa company. Um

2908
05:29:36,340 --> 05:29:38,340
Yeah

2909
05:29:38,660 --> 05:29:43,620
How do I spell Mississippi mi ssi ssi ppi

2910
05:29:44,580 --> 05:29:46,580
I gotta sing it

2911
05:29:46,660 --> 05:29:48,660
But it's funny because they look

2912
05:29:48,660 --> 05:29:50,660
They look very similar

2913
05:29:51,460 --> 05:29:54,740
mi ssi ssi ppi. How is that wrong?

2914
05:29:59,540 --> 05:30:03,220
Are you from Mississippi? Never mind. Um

2915
05:30:06,100 --> 05:30:08,980
No, right. Thank you actually. Um

2916
05:30:09,540 --> 05:30:10,740
Um

2917
05:30:10,740 --> 05:30:13,380
They look a lot alike because I I really like

2918
05:30:14,340 --> 05:30:17,860
I love Siamese cats. I've always grown up with Siamese cats. I've had um

2919
05:30:18,980 --> 05:30:20,980
Three other Siamese cats before them

2920
05:30:21,940 --> 05:30:23,940
because I had um

2921
05:30:26,020 --> 05:30:28,980
Mari, Naomi and Salah

2922
05:30:30,420 --> 05:30:32,420
And um sadly

2923
05:30:33,620 --> 05:30:38,340
A lot like because of I like I don't think I'll ever go to a breeder again

2924
05:30:39,060 --> 05:30:40,740
um

2925
05:30:40,740 --> 05:30:46,340
Because and then my well, I didn't go it was my mom, but like I don't think I would ever get a cat from a breeder again

2926
05:30:46,980 --> 05:30:52,420
um just because like the health issues that even purebred cats can have um because uh

2927
05:30:54,980 --> 05:30:56,980
Salah died at 11

2928
05:30:58,180 --> 05:31:01,220
Naomi died when she was three which really sucked because she had cancer

2929
05:31:02,020 --> 05:31:03,460
and then

2930
05:31:03,460 --> 05:31:06,580
Mari died, I think at five or whatever. I can't really

2931
05:31:07,300 --> 05:31:08,500
know

2932
05:31:08,500 --> 05:31:13,540
Oh my god, did you hear that? That's boomy if you heard that he's running around

2933
05:31:14,340 --> 05:31:16,340
um

2934
05:31:16,340 --> 05:31:22,180
But yeah, so I got rescues this time because I wanted to give like some cats a chance. I was debating whether or not to

2935
05:31:23,620 --> 05:31:26,580
Get a what was that? I was boomy

2936
05:31:27,460 --> 05:31:28,580
um

2937
05:31:28,580 --> 05:31:35,060
I was debating whether or not to get an older cat because like what my dream would be because a lot of people neglect older animals

2938
05:31:35,300 --> 05:31:36,340
um

2939
05:31:36,340 --> 05:31:39,940
and I would love to get like a home and like a little cool like cat area

2940
05:31:40,580 --> 05:31:43,060
or like dog area where I can like um

2941
05:31:44,180 --> 05:31:46,180
Kind of like adopt dogs

2942
05:31:46,980 --> 05:31:48,980
that are older

2943
05:31:49,140 --> 05:31:51,460
um or cats that are older and kind of just like

2944
05:31:52,420 --> 05:31:55,620
Take care of them until their last days because everybody deserves that

2945
05:31:55,620 --> 05:32:00,180
You know, you don't deserve to be sitting in a shelter for that and just give them all the love and care and affection that they

2946
05:32:00,900 --> 05:32:02,900
deserve because everybody deserves that

2947
05:32:03,540 --> 05:32:04,980
um

2948
05:32:05,460 --> 05:32:07,460
and uh

2949
05:32:08,340 --> 05:32:10,500
Yeah, it would be really cool to do that

2950
05:32:10,660 --> 05:32:16,420
So I was debating whether to get an older cat but for rena's comfort ability. I got a kitten because I know she could handle a kitten

2951
05:32:17,460 --> 05:32:19,220
um

2952
05:32:19,220 --> 05:32:20,340
but yeah

2953
05:32:20,340 --> 05:32:21,860
fia is

2954
05:32:21,860 --> 05:32:28,100
Really cool because I've never seen a cat like a lynx point like her before she's technically a lilac point simis

2955
05:32:28,180 --> 05:32:30,180
Which is like very light purpley

2956
05:32:30,740 --> 05:32:31,860
color

2957
05:32:31,860 --> 05:32:36,420
But she has the lynx markings because I'm assuming that her dad or her mom was a tabby cat

2958
05:32:37,220 --> 05:32:38,660
and um

2959
05:32:38,660 --> 05:32:42,260
But or might have been like also a type of gray point cat because that's

2960
05:32:43,140 --> 05:32:45,140
cat genetics aren't weird

2961
05:32:46,180 --> 05:32:53,860
So she her skin is almost like purple rather than pink and she's very like lavender colored like her gray is like lavender

2962
05:32:53,860 --> 05:32:55,860
and which funny is that

2963
05:32:55,860 --> 05:32:58,980
fiala and I think check check of sabaki in her check

2964
05:32:59,540 --> 05:33:00,980
um means

2965
05:33:00,980 --> 05:33:05,140
means lavender so it also worked out that way so I can explain that to people

2966
05:33:06,260 --> 05:33:10,980
instead of fia the deathbed companion of fia from like a normie a person asks

2967
05:33:14,900 --> 05:33:20,980
Unless you're breeding for livestock or some kind of specific work rescues the more economical and morally superior choice

2968
05:33:21,220 --> 05:33:26,340
Yeah, the only reason why my mom got purebred simis is because she wanted

2969
05:33:26,740 --> 05:33:29,860
simis cats are the only cat that my mom wasn't really allergic to

2970
05:33:30,580 --> 05:33:33,860
Um, and so if she she thought if we got like some sort of mix

2971
05:33:34,100 --> 05:33:35,460
It would make her sick

2972
05:33:35,460 --> 05:33:39,620
And then she ends up still being like solea was fine, but rena for some reason

2973
05:33:40,020 --> 05:33:42,500
Um rena's dander is like bad

2974
05:33:43,380 --> 05:33:47,540
Like I'm mildly allergic to rena, but I'll still shove my face into her anyways because I love her to death

2975
05:33:48,180 --> 05:33:49,380
um

2976
05:33:49,380 --> 05:33:51,380
You know have a good one

2977
05:33:52,180 --> 05:33:55,380
Uh, but yeah, sorry. I'm like talking about my cats

2978
05:33:56,820 --> 05:33:58,820
I'm sorry. I'm yapping

2979
05:33:59,860 --> 05:34:01,860
About my cats

2980
05:34:02,740 --> 05:34:09,140
I can talk about my cats for like what else do I have to talk about? I'm just a fucking old lady hanging out with three cats. I'm sorry

2981
05:34:09,940 --> 05:34:11,700
You can continue

2982
05:34:11,700 --> 05:34:18,580
Why do you apologize because I'm I'm just an apologetic person. I'm just used to apologizing for a lot of shit. Okay. It's trauma. Okay. It's trauma enough

2983
05:34:21,780 --> 05:34:25,220
Um, I will continue to apologize for the raps. It'll never stop

2984
05:34:25,540 --> 05:34:27,540
You did

2985
05:34:29,060 --> 05:34:32,500
I thought about a pure bird myself. I'm wondering so perhaps with a cat something to the problem

2986
05:34:32,580 --> 05:34:38,020
Yeah, I've also like I wanted to get a pure bed dog for like protection and get them specially trained for that

2987
05:34:38,340 --> 05:34:40,340
Um, like a working dog

2988
05:34:47,860 --> 05:34:51,220
That's rena rena, what are you doing?

2989
05:34:55,860 --> 05:34:57,860
Oh

2990
05:34:59,460 --> 05:35:01,460
Reina

2991
05:35:08,260 --> 05:35:14,020
Hey, boomie, what are you doing to her? She's trying to sing the song of her people and you're fucking up her song

2992
05:35:14,660 --> 05:35:16,660
Are you okay, rena? Did you guys hear that?

2993
05:35:17,780 --> 05:35:19,780
My cats are

2994
05:35:20,020 --> 05:35:21,220
Yeah

2995
05:35:21,220 --> 05:35:23,220
They're fighting

2996
05:35:23,380 --> 05:35:27,780
Yeah, that that was rena running around from boomie because sometimes they fight over um

2997
05:35:29,620 --> 05:35:31,460
Our boomie just doesn't know where to stop. Let me check

2998
05:35:32,420 --> 05:35:34,420
Reina, are you good? She's fine

2999
05:35:34,660 --> 05:35:36,660
boomie

3000
05:35:37,220 --> 05:35:40,820
What are you doing? You know you did something bad. You were hiding from me

3001
05:35:42,580 --> 05:35:45,460
What are you doing? Don't give me that look

3002
05:35:48,900 --> 05:35:50,900
Why are you chasing her like that?

3003
05:35:53,940 --> 05:36:00,100
Hey, would you give a reason to do these? You have plenty of toys on the ground that you can play with or you can play with fia

3004
05:36:01,860 --> 05:36:04,260
Must be as hiding from you because you're being a menace

3005
05:36:05,780 --> 05:36:08,340
Who means like avoiding eye contact with me? He's just like

3006
05:36:11,540 --> 05:36:13,540
Why are you sure? Why are you doing that?

3007
05:36:16,020 --> 05:36:18,020
If you're spraying

3008
05:36:18,180 --> 05:36:21,380
Whether the game you're spraying the play with we have to find you another one

3009
05:36:23,300 --> 05:36:24,980
What?

3010
05:36:24,980 --> 05:36:26,980
What?

3011
05:36:27,540 --> 05:36:29,540
Are you grumpy because you want to go into the fridge?

3012
05:36:35,780 --> 05:36:37,780
All right, I did catch an answer

3013
05:36:39,620 --> 05:36:45,220
What are you doing? I want to get you a little more low tide. You look very dapper in a low tide

3014
05:36:46,660 --> 05:36:49,160
You know labor alone. She doesn't want to play right now

3015
05:36:53,220 --> 05:36:55,220
Oh

3016
05:36:55,460 --> 05:36:58,420
Yeah, I warned you you get back

3017
05:37:07,620 --> 05:37:09,620
Let's go home you guys

3018
05:37:12,500 --> 05:37:14,500
Raina are you okay?

3019
05:37:23,220 --> 05:37:25,220
Okay

3020
05:37:34,580 --> 05:37:36,580
Okay, Raina in my arms

3021
05:37:39,060 --> 05:37:41,780
You might hear a growl because she's irritated

3022
05:37:43,540 --> 05:37:50,020
And when she sees if even if i'm holding her and but boomie or fear all around and she's in a bad mood she'll like

3023
05:37:50,900 --> 05:37:52,900
Irritatedly meow at them

3024
05:37:56,020 --> 05:37:58,020
Hi

3025
05:37:58,100 --> 05:38:00,100
We shall

3026
05:38:03,060 --> 05:38:05,620
Are you grumpy because boomie's chasing you

3027
05:38:10,660 --> 05:38:14,660
I will protect you from all around

3028
05:38:15,780 --> 05:38:17,780
I will be here don't

3029
05:38:18,340 --> 05:38:21,140
Cry it's funny because now she's purring

3030
05:38:32,020 --> 05:38:35,460
Fia, can you not grab my wire? It's literally like I have three kids

3031
05:38:36,260 --> 05:38:40,260
Except one's the oldest and then I have two twins that are just like fucking

3032
05:38:41,300 --> 05:38:43,300
cracked out

3033
05:38:43,780 --> 05:38:45,780
Oh

3034
05:38:46,100 --> 05:38:51,060
No, fia, don't try to bap her fucking tail. Fia's like right under my desk trying to

3035
05:38:53,300 --> 05:39:00,980
Try to paw at raina's tail. I know she was just trying to see raina likes to hop into my my um

3036
05:39:02,180 --> 05:39:04,180
bathtub

3037
05:39:04,980 --> 05:39:06,980
And just yell

3038
05:39:07,300 --> 05:39:13,620
I think she likes the acoustics in the bathtub. Oh, you want a hug? I'll give you a hug, Raina

3039
05:39:15,700 --> 05:39:17,700
When a purr

3040
05:39:19,620 --> 05:39:23,220
You want to head but the mic oh there they go

3041
05:39:27,300 --> 05:39:29,300
Boomie

3042
05:39:29,380 --> 05:39:31,380
Oh

3043
05:39:31,620 --> 05:39:37,940
Boomie, let's leave fia alone. Jesus. What is on what is wrong with you today? Okay, hold on

3044
05:39:39,940 --> 05:39:46,260
You might hear fia like yell in a moment. Yeah, that was Raina though. Hold on a second

3045
05:39:47,380 --> 05:39:50,100
Boomie, you're done. You're done. Come here

3046
05:39:51,860 --> 05:39:53,860
Come here, mister

3047
05:39:53,940 --> 05:39:55,620
Get up

3048
05:39:55,620 --> 05:39:57,620
Come on

3049
05:39:57,780 --> 05:40:02,180
No, don't try to cutely lick my foot. Come here

3050
05:40:03,700 --> 05:40:08,420
Come here get up. Why are you so fat? You're not fat. You're just heavy

3051
05:40:09,620 --> 05:40:11,620
Can you get up?

3052
05:40:12,900 --> 05:40:18,100
You're literally you know where I'm bringing you because when sometimes when boomie gets too much I have to put them in the crate

3053
05:40:27,620 --> 05:40:29,620
So

3054
05:40:46,260 --> 05:40:48,660
My ear boomie like meow in a moment

3055
05:40:51,060 --> 05:40:53,060
But he's he's being too much

3056
05:40:53,460 --> 05:40:55,460
I

3057
05:41:00,580 --> 05:41:06,100
Want attention to go to bed. I've given them attention all day today before I streamed

3058
05:41:08,020 --> 05:41:10,020
The juicy cat drama

3059
05:41:11,300 --> 05:41:14,180
They're catnip if they're catnip, do you think that they'd be chill?

3060
05:41:14,180 --> 05:41:16,180
Yeah

3061
05:41:19,860 --> 05:41:24,900
Sometimes like what's funny about boomie is he hates it when the cats like play independently without him

3062
05:41:25,300 --> 05:41:27,300
He like has to be a part of it

3063
05:41:27,300 --> 05:41:31,220
Like fia was just playing with like a ball and that's when boomie came over and just started like

3064
05:41:31,860 --> 05:41:33,860
Abiding her and I'm like dude

3065
05:41:35,540 --> 05:41:40,500
Booby apology video coming soon. We start riding like silent

3066
05:41:41,460 --> 05:41:47,460
These kittens are bouncing around jumping up walls keeping up with the cotton bums. That's actually really cute

3067
05:41:48,500 --> 05:41:53,220
Uh, except make the c into a k so I can be like a Kardashian or some shit

3068
05:41:56,180 --> 05:42:02,500
Yeah, sometimes boomie um forgets that he's so much bigger than the other girls. I've actually like

3069
05:42:03,300 --> 05:42:07,860
Debated getting another boy cat just for him just for a little like buddy

3070
05:42:08,100 --> 05:42:14,020
But I don't think I can sneak four cats in my apartment. So I'm just gonna

3071
05:42:16,180 --> 05:42:20,900
Speaking of that I have to reapply for my housing for my apartment and I don't know really how to do it

3072
05:42:21,620 --> 05:42:22,740
because

3073
05:42:22,740 --> 05:42:24,740
Since I don't have a job right now

3074
05:42:29,780 --> 05:42:36,820
Sorry I heard meowing that again fia only meows when she plays with a toy so but she sounds like she's like hurt but she's not

3075
05:42:38,020 --> 05:42:42,500
He's like meow meow meow and I'm like, are you okay?

3076
05:42:43,780 --> 05:42:45,780
So she's fine

3077
05:42:46,420 --> 05:42:48,660
She just gets really that's her excited meow

3078
05:42:54,100 --> 05:42:56,600
Boomie is cute. Yeah, he is a cutie

3079
05:43:02,340 --> 05:43:04,340
Yeah, hold on

3080
05:43:08,500 --> 05:43:10,500
Are you gonna chill?

3081
05:43:27,620 --> 05:43:29,620
I have a little crate for them

3082
05:43:33,860 --> 05:43:35,860
It's almost like a dog crate

3083
05:43:37,860 --> 05:43:41,860
But you can create a cat I used to create fia once you couldn't

3084
05:43:43,460 --> 05:43:47,540
She was sick to look that when we wouldn't try to play with her

3085
05:43:48,420 --> 05:43:50,420
She was very good

3086
05:43:52,420 --> 05:43:56,900
It's really weird telling you time these cats are very similar to mom

3087
05:44:07,860 --> 05:44:09,860
You

3088
05:44:32,420 --> 05:44:34,420
Have to sit she be

3089
05:44:34,820 --> 05:44:41,540
Yeah, no, they just sent me a notice to renew that's why I'm like, oh I have to fill that out

3090
05:44:41,780 --> 05:44:44,020
Sorry if you hear craziness in the background

3091
05:44:44,980 --> 05:44:46,420
um

3092
05:44:46,420 --> 05:44:51,060
So yeah, I have filled out a little bit of it today. I have to reach out to my former boss and be like hi

3093
05:44:52,180 --> 05:44:54,340
Can you let them know that I'm not there?

3094
05:44:56,020 --> 05:44:59,060
Can you prove to them that I'm no longer employed?

3095
05:45:00,180 --> 05:45:02,180
Because yeah, again

3096
05:45:02,740 --> 05:45:04,740
It's just

3097
05:45:06,340 --> 05:45:08,340
Bro, it's so stupid. Why can't I just like live?

3098
05:45:09,140 --> 05:45:13,940
I can't wait to buy my own house in like a couple years or something. That'd be so so so nice

3099
05:45:16,100 --> 05:45:18,980
Oh my dreams won't come true

3100
05:45:19,220 --> 05:45:21,220
Oh

3101
05:45:30,740 --> 05:45:34,500
I don't know what goes okay. Yeah, me too. They gave me a hard time last time

3102
05:45:36,500 --> 05:45:39,540
So I'm hoping that they don't give me a hard time this time

3103
05:45:41,380 --> 05:45:44,900
Buy a house with a basement for the hair to be lost

3104
05:45:45,460 --> 05:45:47,460
I

3105
05:45:47,780 --> 05:45:49,780
Buy a basement with a house

3106
05:45:52,980 --> 05:45:59,460
Okay, I wanted to see if I can stream till midnight but because my cats are being very rowdy and they're distracting me a lot

3107
05:45:59,460 --> 05:46:02,180
I'm just gonna I'm gonna say bye for now

3108
05:46:03,860 --> 05:46:09,540
But thank you for spending time with me. I appreciate it always for you guys chilling with me

3109
05:46:12,420 --> 05:46:14,420
Nocturnal kiddies, yeah

3110
05:46:15,620 --> 05:46:17,620
Obviously the parents

3111
05:46:26,660 --> 05:46:31,380
Sorry, I'm still yapping. I could yapp for longer but my cats are rowdy

3112
05:46:32,340 --> 05:46:35,700
They're like mad that I'm still like I think they also have just like a shit

3113
05:46:36,740 --> 05:46:43,140
Um sleep schedule because my sleep schedule is shit. So they're like chat cat reflects streamer right now

3114
05:46:44,100 --> 05:46:50,500
Not chat cat reflects streamer. Um, let me find someone to raid. I don't think anybody's

3115
05:47:05,860 --> 05:47:09,700
Oh Maro's streaming he's playing Dave the diver

3116
05:47:14,100 --> 05:47:16,100
Oh

3117
05:47:18,980 --> 05:47:20,980
I'm gonna send you guys to Maro

3118
05:47:29,300 --> 05:47:34,740
Why is it telling me to verify my identity? Oh fuck

3119
05:47:37,860 --> 05:47:42,660
I don't know what any of this shit is I'm just gonna let management deal with that. What the hell

3120
05:47:44,100 --> 05:47:46,100
I don't know what that means

3121
05:47:46,820 --> 05:47:49,860
That's why I don't stop me because I don't can't read

3122
05:47:54,420 --> 05:47:56,420
Okay

3123
05:47:57,060 --> 05:47:59,060
Bye everybody

3124
05:47:59,460 --> 05:48:03,060
Sorry like nine. Yeah, I've been streaming since six by the way

3125
05:48:04,900 --> 05:48:10,340
I've streamed for almost six hours again. I I didn't know I was an endurance streamer, but

3126
05:48:11,300 --> 05:48:13,300
I just can't get enough of you

3127
05:48:15,300 --> 05:48:17,940
Some people thought I was streaming like I like eight or something

3128
05:48:19,620 --> 05:48:21,620
No, I've been streaming for a while

3129
05:48:22,100 --> 05:48:24,100
um

3130
05:48:24,100 --> 05:48:26,420
I was literally gonna get off after

3131
05:48:27,700 --> 05:48:29,460
That stream ended

3132
05:48:29,460 --> 05:48:34,020
Well, then Azura said she was gonna talk to her stream. I'm like, oh, yeah, I'll talk to my stream

3133
05:48:34,660 --> 05:48:36,660
And then look where I am now

3134
05:48:36,900 --> 05:48:38,900
Three hours later

3135
05:48:41,300 --> 05:48:45,060
Three hours later just you know

3136
05:48:47,540 --> 05:48:49,540
Oh god, no

3137
05:48:49,540 --> 05:48:53,300
No, I can't hear it. I was like accidentally my stream is gonna play back

3138
05:48:56,500 --> 05:48:59,860
We love the app. Yeah, you better love the app

3139
05:49:00,180 --> 05:49:07,060
Well, one time I literally streamed for like almost like 11 hours and I lapped for like seven and I like remember looking back at that

3140
05:49:07,060 --> 05:49:10,180
Stream I'm like, what is wrong with me? I'm so lonely

3141
05:49:11,380 --> 05:49:12,420
Yeah

3142
05:49:12,420 --> 05:49:14,420
This can't shut up. I don't know

3143
05:49:14,820 --> 05:49:17,860
I'm so used to like being quiet and like

3144
05:49:19,860 --> 05:49:24,100
Being a listener, so it's kind of nice just to just to talk at people

3145
05:49:30,420 --> 05:49:32,020
Um

3146
05:49:32,020 --> 05:49:34,020
I'm giving you guys a virtual hug

3147
05:49:34,980 --> 05:49:36,820
Thank you

3148
05:49:36,820 --> 05:49:38,820
Thank you

3149
05:49:41,620 --> 05:49:46,260
I am a lonely needy parasocial bitch

3150
05:49:50,340 --> 05:49:55,780
You guys get a little hug and I'm smothered here. I'm gonna put you right between my movies

3151
05:49:56,420 --> 05:49:58,020
like that

3152
05:49:58,020 --> 05:50:01,940
You guys are smothered right between my titties

3153
05:50:07,540 --> 05:50:09,540
I just really just talk the mic between them

3154
05:50:12,980 --> 05:50:14,980
Cool

3155
05:50:16,180 --> 05:50:22,100
I don't uh, my boobs aren't that stretchy to do that with a 3DO. I'm sorry the 3DO is a bit longer

3156
05:50:22,340 --> 05:50:25,380
Whereas this is like a simple at 2020

3157
05:50:27,300 --> 05:50:29,300
That's a little bit

3158
05:50:31,780 --> 05:50:33,780
Ow just set my nipple

3159
05:50:37,780 --> 05:50:39,780
More pillow

3160
05:50:40,820 --> 05:50:45,780
Yeah, 3DO is be hard. I know like I think starting to like a thigh thing, which I was like, hey, that's pretty smart

3161
05:50:47,140 --> 05:50:53,380
Very nice inverse of my experiment experience. Oh, how is she we stream? Oh, it's great

3162
05:50:53,460 --> 05:50:56,100
She ended it by smacking us with her boob

3163
05:50:57,460 --> 05:51:00,100
And tucking us between them and giving us a hug

3164
05:51:01,380 --> 05:51:03,380
I like how I haven't left yet

3165
05:51:04,340 --> 05:51:08,500
A part of me wants this I'm gonna stay till midnight you have eight minutes left with me

3166
05:51:10,420 --> 05:51:12,420
What can I talk about for eight minutes

3167
05:51:13,700 --> 05:51:15,700
I'm not gone yet. Come back

3168
05:51:16,820 --> 05:51:18,100
Come here

3169
05:51:18,100 --> 05:51:21,860
Get over here. Get over here. I'm wrapped up in my blinky

3170
05:51:24,260 --> 05:51:26,260
I'm spoiling you with my presence

3171
05:51:26,980 --> 05:51:34,740
Why would what would I do why would I talk about my my booba? What am I gonna say about it? They're there

3172
05:51:35,540 --> 05:51:37,540
They're large and in charge

3173
05:51:37,780 --> 05:51:40,500
I'm gonna smack myself in the face with them

3174
05:51:41,380 --> 05:51:46,180
Did I eat yet? Um, I had applesauce and a bite of a

3175
05:51:47,460 --> 05:51:53,300
I remember what it was like a case of dia. I just my tummy has been really upset. I can't eat

3176
05:51:54,260 --> 05:51:56,260
I don't know what's happening

3177
05:52:00,180 --> 05:52:03,780
Can I help you right now? I just hopped up my desk like hello

3178
05:52:08,260 --> 05:52:10,260
You coming to snuggle ma'am

3179
05:52:12,340 --> 05:52:14,660
Did you just hear a squeak she's went meh

3180
05:52:15,540 --> 05:52:17,540
You coming to snuggle

3181
05:52:18,260 --> 05:52:20,260
Why are you meowing at me?

3182
05:52:24,180 --> 05:52:30,900
Yes, I also have water I've been staying hydrated because I know if I can't eat I need to drink more water

3183
05:52:39,860 --> 05:52:43,460
You nesting now on me you just like went to a little loaf pose

3184
05:52:46,580 --> 05:52:50,100
Why the drills for your hair? I don't know ask strawney

3185
05:52:50,340 --> 05:52:57,460
You guys don't I don't know if you guys recall. I didn't the models were already made by the time I was hired

3186
05:52:59,060 --> 05:53:02,100
In the names. I didn't pick anything. I'm just here. I'm just a voice

3187
05:53:03,060 --> 05:53:05,060
strawney was like, you know what?

3188
05:53:05,780 --> 05:53:11,300
Your voice. I'm sorry to smack my mic because I'm waggling my finger. Your voice is the one that I want

3189
05:53:12,020 --> 05:53:15,700
There's a one that I want a lot a lot a lot a lot

3190
05:53:16,900 --> 05:53:19,780
If it was up to me, I'd be cute and funny and I'd be brown

3191
05:53:20,740 --> 05:53:22,740
I'd be a nice tan

3192
05:53:22,900 --> 05:53:24,900
cute and funny

3193
05:53:25,380 --> 05:53:27,380
character

3194
05:53:32,340 --> 05:53:35,140
I do like my drill hair I like it a lot

3195
05:53:41,300 --> 05:53:43,300
I

3196
05:53:47,300 --> 05:53:50,100
Like a brown cat. Yeah, like a brown cat

3197
05:53:52,420 --> 05:53:54,580
Not go I can't imagine you was a little

3198
05:53:56,820 --> 05:53:59,780
Do they know does he know?

3199
05:54:02,100 --> 05:54:04,100
That's what I was before

3200
05:54:05,780 --> 05:54:07,780
Before I was hired on

3201
05:54:08,740 --> 05:54:10,740
Yeah, boomie exactly

3202
05:54:14,820 --> 05:54:17,460
What are you doing? Why are you attacking the carpet?

3203
05:54:18,980 --> 05:54:22,740
What is the what did the carpet do to you dude?

3204
05:54:26,260 --> 05:54:28,260
He's like a dog I swear to god

3205
05:54:31,540 --> 05:54:33,540
Yeah, I was I was very cute funny

3206
05:54:34,020 --> 05:54:36,020
I

3207
05:54:36,580 --> 05:54:38,580
Talked about about it before

3208
05:54:40,100 --> 05:54:42,980
Sorry, you guys can hear scuffling. That's boomy

3209
05:54:44,820 --> 05:54:46,820
He's chewing on the carpet

3210
05:54:49,460 --> 05:54:51,940
What is wrong with you there's nothing under there

3211
05:54:54,740 --> 05:54:59,460
Boomy there's nothing under the carpet that you need. It's probably like a piece of fucking litter

3212
05:54:59,460 --> 05:55:01,460
Oh

3213
05:55:02,020 --> 05:55:04,020
My god, he's ridiculous

3214
05:55:04,660 --> 05:55:06,660
um

3215
05:55:07,140 --> 05:55:09,140
Crazy cat

3216
05:55:09,940 --> 05:55:14,180
Transfer students shows up and even pink was on gonga homanga bonga gongas

3217
05:55:17,060 --> 05:55:20,500
Um, let me hear the voices he smells it's fear

3218
05:55:22,100 --> 05:55:24,100
It's like it's here. I love will follow

3219
05:55:25,060 --> 05:55:27,060
Yeah, I can't wait. Um

3220
05:55:28,020 --> 05:55:30,980
I'm already thinking about ideas for the 2.0

3221
05:55:32,660 --> 05:55:34,660
um

3222
05:55:35,620 --> 05:55:37,620
Yeah, boomy knows what's up

3223
05:55:43,380 --> 05:55:45,780
Lead hours boomy starts tweaking

3224
05:55:46,980 --> 05:55:48,980
He's literally always tweaking

3225
05:55:50,020 --> 05:55:55,380
That's that's how he meows though. He doesn't like meow meow. He just makes that noise

3226
05:55:57,620 --> 05:55:59,620
It's really funny

3227
05:56:01,060 --> 05:56:03,060
Sometimes he'll actually meow and it honestly

3228
05:56:03,780 --> 05:56:10,340
Shocks me now. So I'm just like, what did you what did you just open your mouth and do an actual meow instead of just like hum?

3229
05:56:15,300 --> 05:56:18,740
I think what's the matter? Why'd you just hop this is boomy nearby?

3230
05:56:21,220 --> 05:56:24,180
The hair I'm at 3 am is pretty much boomy incarnate

3231
05:56:25,060 --> 05:56:31,620
Bro is doing sideways some results on the he was you don't understand. So I don't think

3232
05:56:32,660 --> 05:56:35,300
So what boomy was doing? He was laying on his side

3233
05:56:36,180 --> 05:56:38,180
and he was pulling himself

3234
05:56:38,340 --> 05:56:41,460
Across my hardwood floor because I have a little carpet under my chair

3235
05:56:41,460 --> 05:56:46,100
So doesn't make noise when it rolls around and so he's pulling himself across a carpet

3236
05:56:47,860 --> 05:56:52,180
On his side with his head and it's just like and then he was kicking it with his back feet

3237
05:56:54,260 --> 05:56:57,220
He's dragging himself along with his claws and I'm just like, okay

3238
05:56:58,020 --> 05:57:02,580
Um, are you good or do I like I just gave him a toy to play with he doesn't care

3239
05:57:03,620 --> 05:57:05,620
um

3240
05:57:05,620 --> 05:57:09,380
Another thing before before of course fucking boomy derail stuff

3241
05:57:10,420 --> 05:57:12,420
I don't remember

3242
05:57:12,900 --> 05:57:14,900
Oh, but yeah, so like um

3243
05:57:17,140 --> 05:57:19,140
Yeah, just

3244
05:57:19,780 --> 05:57:21,780
I don't think

3245
05:57:22,500 --> 05:57:26,980
I would like I would like to be cute playing again because I like speaking in my higher voice

3246
05:57:28,260 --> 05:57:32,020
But the thing is I don't think I could do patreon audio in my higher voice

3247
05:57:33,540 --> 05:57:37,540
So it would definitely be like a big gap my way moment

3248
05:57:39,780 --> 05:57:45,220
Maybe I could I don't know I haven't really tried because I can maintain the voice for a long time like emmy does

3249
05:57:45,460 --> 05:57:47,460
Um

3250
05:57:49,620 --> 05:57:51,620
Callous this

3251
05:57:53,300 --> 05:57:55,300
I was gonna make a joke whenever man

3252
05:57:56,180 --> 05:57:58,180
um

3253
05:57:58,900 --> 05:58:02,100
Higher voice works with this model. Yeah, it does like you guys

3254
05:58:02,740 --> 05:58:03,780
um

3255
05:58:03,780 --> 05:58:09,700
It's funny when you don't see when you see my like not my boob chest, but like my upper chest up

3256
05:58:10,100 --> 05:58:15,860
Like a higher voice works really well. Hi everyone. Hi, my name is she be cotton bum

3257
05:58:16,820 --> 05:58:18,020
um

3258
05:58:18,020 --> 05:58:24,260
And then when you see just my head and you don't see the like the pointiness of my chin. I look very cute and funny

3259
05:58:26,340 --> 05:58:29,700
Yeah, the british voice audio like really a lot of people liked it

3260
05:58:29,940 --> 05:58:32,740
That's funny because I can do that higher pitch british

3261
05:58:33,220 --> 05:58:38,580
Voice without the need of the voice changer too. I don't know why the voice changer makes it for people

3262
05:58:40,100 --> 05:58:42,100
Because I can go up that high

3263
05:58:43,860 --> 05:58:45,860
British

3264
05:58:47,060 --> 05:58:53,380
Hi again, it's me british she be um, I don't know if you missed me or anything, but

3265
05:58:54,340 --> 05:58:57,460
I know I missed you. Um, it's been

3266
05:58:58,340 --> 05:59:02,900
Really difficult not being able to see you these last few days. Uh

3267
05:59:03,940 --> 05:59:07,860
I hope you don't mind that um, I missed you so much

3268
05:59:08,100 --> 05:59:12,340
I just can't help that. I love you immensely

3269
05:59:15,220 --> 05:59:19,220
Don't don't take it the wrong way though. I just

3270
05:59:21,940 --> 05:59:23,940
British conny she be

3271
05:59:26,420 --> 05:59:31,300
British she be could be the way to yeah, we just become velour uh eu

3272
05:59:31,300 --> 05:59:33,300
I

3273
05:59:36,900 --> 05:59:38,900
Thank you forever

3274
05:59:40,100 --> 05:59:44,580
Yeah, it's really funny you and people a lot of people didn't think it was me as she be

3275
05:59:45,220 --> 05:59:49,300
Um from my pl because they're like their voices are different and then

3276
05:59:50,180 --> 05:59:52,180
I'm like it's voice acting

3277
05:59:52,980 --> 05:59:55,220
But like I do sound like my pl

3278
05:59:56,180 --> 05:59:59,140
Like it it comes out sometimes when I'm very excited

3279
05:59:59,620 --> 06:00:04,660
Oh my god, we're gonna fucking beat this guy. I swear to fucking god. I swear to god. I'm gonna kick his ass

3280
06:00:04,740 --> 06:00:07,060
Especially when I'm playing like like I'll just goes up

3281
06:00:07,860 --> 06:00:09,860
um

3282
06:00:11,060 --> 06:00:13,060
Yeah

3283
06:00:13,060 --> 06:00:15,060
So it kept up the fit

3284
06:00:16,020 --> 06:00:18,020
Voice acting isn't real

3285
06:00:18,740 --> 06:00:20,740
What are you saying?

3286
06:00:25,780 --> 06:00:31,780
Yeah, all these voices are mine. They're just they're all separate people just leaning into the microphone

3287
06:00:34,980 --> 06:00:38,180
Wait, is mercy streaming today? I don't think she is

3288
06:00:41,780 --> 06:00:44,260
Vilaire, but if us lost the revolutionary war

3289
06:00:46,660 --> 06:00:48,660
Um

3290
06:00:49,780 --> 06:00:51,780
Because voice changers exist

3291
06:00:52,740 --> 06:00:54,740
Oh, I guess that's true

3292
06:01:01,460 --> 06:01:06,580
Hmm guys, I don't go on vacation until the 18th. It's like I still have a week

3293
06:01:07,780 --> 06:01:14,020
I watched arena a little bit before Vilaire could hardly tell too. Oh, thank you. That's a compliment

3294
06:01:14,100 --> 06:01:23,220
Shebethany's inseparate it is shebethany comes to like just like I let her into my apartment and then she comes and she speaks to the mic

3295
06:01:28,740 --> 06:01:30,740
I'm already missing man. I'm right here

3296
06:01:32,500 --> 06:01:34,980
Oh, I'm gonna be gone until the 23rd

3297
06:01:37,220 --> 06:01:39,220
The 23rd

3298
06:01:44,580 --> 06:01:49,140
Yes, I've told chat before I'm going to see my grandparents

3299
06:01:51,940 --> 06:01:54,180
In florida florida

3300
06:01:55,620 --> 06:01:57,620
Why are you looking at me like that, rena?

3301
06:01:57,620 --> 06:01:58,740
Hey

3302
06:01:58,740 --> 06:02:03,620
Why are you so snuggly today? You've been stuck to me like, ooh, you know, I'm leaving soon, huh?

3303
06:02:04,260 --> 06:02:06,260
But you get to see grandma

3304
06:02:07,140 --> 06:02:13,460
We're technically our mom because my mom always say that me and rena and sale were sisters and she was just raising three daughters

3305
06:02:14,580 --> 06:02:16,580
So I guess rena's my sister

3306
06:02:21,860 --> 06:02:27,540
Florida man, I know it's gonna be fucking sweltering. I'm not looking forward to it

3307
06:02:32,020 --> 06:02:36,580
Yeah, no, I might I might I'm debating whether or not do you know bible study or not

3308
06:02:38,260 --> 06:02:40,260
Just because I won't be able to bible study

3309
06:02:44,980 --> 06:02:52,500
I had a cat sister too. I know I'm like I don't like the south for that reason

3310
06:02:56,420 --> 06:03:02,340
My bible I think no bible study would be fun enough for doing it together. Yeah

3311
06:03:04,900 --> 06:03:06,900
We should suffer

3312
06:03:07,460 --> 06:03:11,220
I know I'm nervous. That's why I'm nervous like I don't want my stuff to get delayed

3313
06:03:12,100 --> 06:03:14,580
I'm very anxious because I have a layover as well

3314
06:03:15,460 --> 06:03:20,100
That's another reason because I'm uh, yeah, I said this earlier, but I'm flying by myself

3315
06:03:20,980 --> 06:03:25,940
Because like I haven't gone to see my grandparents by myself in a very long time since I was like 16

3316
06:03:26,100 --> 06:03:29,780
They've been up here, but like they're older. They can't really travel that well. My parents are busy

3317
06:03:30,100 --> 06:03:32,100
They also my parents just left without me

3318
06:03:32,740 --> 06:03:34,740
recently to go see them

3319
06:03:35,780 --> 06:03:39,380
And I'm pissed about that so I'm going it's now my turn to go down and see them

3320
06:03:41,860 --> 06:03:44,340
I was secretly hoping my parents would pay for me, but they did not

3321
06:03:45,540 --> 06:03:47,220
They're like, sorry

3322
06:03:47,220 --> 06:03:49,220
They're on your own and I'm like

3323
06:03:52,580 --> 06:03:54,580
Yeah, I'll be I'll be getting good food

3324
06:03:56,260 --> 06:03:58,260
I see you

3325
06:03:58,580 --> 06:04:00,580
Haitian food

3326
06:04:01,220 --> 06:04:02,820
um

3327
06:04:02,820 --> 06:04:04,820
Yeah, spend time with family

3328
06:04:04,820 --> 06:04:08,660
It's always nice. I sometimes you need that and I think I need to disconnect a little bit

3329
06:04:09,620 --> 06:04:11,620
Because I'm literally on the computer like every day

3330
06:04:12,500 --> 06:04:15,000
Like I don't mind it, but I like I know in general. It's not healthy

3331
06:04:17,540 --> 06:04:20,820
And I'm like, oh, maybe I'll fix my um sleep schedule. I'm there

3332
06:04:24,820 --> 06:04:27,860
So quality flavor in the cell, yeah, I'm gonna get some like barbecue or something

3333
06:04:28,740 --> 06:04:33,940
They eaten Florida gators. I've never had gator. I don't even know if my grandparents have eaten gator

3334
06:04:34,020 --> 06:04:36,260
The long time that they've lived down there

3335
06:04:38,660 --> 06:04:40,660
I

3336
06:04:42,180 --> 06:04:48,180
Think he is gonna help out preventing I don't know. Yeah, it's not I'm not taking a vacation because I'm burning and like I'm

3337
06:04:49,220 --> 06:04:52,980
I'm feeling burnt out. This is like something I planned a while ago

3338
06:04:54,420 --> 06:04:56,420
Like before I was in velar

3339
06:04:57,220 --> 06:04:58,980
so

3340
06:04:58,980 --> 06:05:00,980
um

3341
06:05:00,980 --> 06:05:02,980
So don't worry about that

3342
06:05:03,060 --> 06:05:09,300
Because if it was up to me I'd keep going I was I was literally saying earlier like oh

3343
06:05:09,300 --> 06:05:11,300
I'd bring my laptop with me

3344
06:05:11,300 --> 06:05:16,580
If I could if I had a microphone that I could bring because like my at 2020 is a is a condenser mic

3345
06:05:16,660 --> 06:05:19,540
So it needs to be plugged into a mixer and stuff

3346
06:05:20,660 --> 06:05:22,660
um

3347
06:05:23,620 --> 06:05:28,820
Or I just bring it with me and just like walk myself in the guest bedroom and just like yeah

3348
06:05:29,300 --> 06:05:32,100
I'm trying not to swear in front of my christian family

3349
06:05:33,860 --> 06:05:39,780
What time is it it's 12 o' seven you guys kept me talking you little bitches

3350
06:05:41,940 --> 06:05:43,940
You whores

3351
06:05:47,380 --> 06:05:52,900
Because I'm like why are people saying good night and I'm like wait I've been talking longer than eight minutes just 15

3352
06:05:52,900 --> 06:05:54,900
No, I'm not staying up till one

3353
06:05:56,660 --> 06:05:59,060
If I'm me also Bible studies. Yeah

3354
06:06:03,940 --> 06:06:08,980
Swap out swears with bible verses. Oh, matthew mark. Look at john

3355
06:06:11,300 --> 06:06:15,460
Holy judges, are you sawming me right now?

3356
06:06:19,300 --> 06:06:21,780
Oh my revelations

3357
06:06:27,220 --> 06:06:30,500
Thank goodness my family does not bible study at all the time brother

3358
06:06:31,460 --> 06:06:33,460
You Corinthians

3359
06:06:34,500 --> 06:06:36,500
You

3360
06:06:37,620 --> 06:06:39,620
Oh my genesis

3361
06:06:41,460 --> 06:06:44,980
You know lord and saints names in vain those aren't saints

3362
06:06:46,820 --> 06:06:51,220
How long do you throw gifts normally take to arrive it really depends on the seller sometimes like

3363
06:06:52,020 --> 06:06:55,300
One time I forget what one of you guys got me from like amazon

3364
06:06:55,700 --> 06:07:00,180
Um, but the I also can't tell if it's like it's technically from amazon most stuff is from amazon

3365
06:07:00,900 --> 06:07:03,300
um when you guys buy stuff, um

3366
06:07:05,700 --> 06:07:08,580
And it literally showed up like the next fucking day and I was like what?

3367
06:07:14,100 --> 06:07:19,140
Stream is never gonna end guys get over it mad. I'm unleashing infinite. Yeah, it's no jutsu

3368
06:07:21,620 --> 06:07:27,860
You're acting like a real Judas right now, but that's a bible character. I'm I was saying bible books

3369
06:07:31,300 --> 06:07:34,020
The heels don't yeah like the heels still haven't come in yet

3370
06:07:36,740 --> 06:07:41,380
They like recently shipped a couple days ago and those were ordered like weeks ago

3371
06:07:48,260 --> 06:07:52,500
Like my psalms, but it's not poms. It's psalms

3372
06:07:56,900 --> 06:07:58,900
Hold back the seas for a week. Yeah

3373
06:08:01,060 --> 06:08:03,060
I

3374
06:08:07,460 --> 06:08:12,420
Have this idea for a gift and I wouldn't want it to get there when you're gone. Oh understandable

3375
06:08:13,060 --> 06:08:15,060
That makes sense. It'll just hang out my mail room

3376
06:08:16,820 --> 06:08:20,020
For postal mail guys everybody relax

3377
06:08:22,100 --> 06:08:25,380

I like I love how I I like jokingly made the daddy joke and some of you guys have just gone with it

3405
06:10:38,580 --> 06:10:44,020
Some of you guys just really love calling me daddy, but you know, it's okay. I'll accept it

3406
06:10:44,580 --> 06:10:49,700
We must have a different Ken dolls. Are you saying that you play the dolls you little bitch, you know, can I?

3418
06:11:37,540 --> 06:11:39,380
It's funny because like

3419
06:11:39,380 --> 06:11:44,260
Strawny's intention with me was supposed to be like step on me mommy, but I don't really think I'm step on me mommy

3420
06:11:44,260 --> 06:11:46,260
I'm just a loser

3421
06:11:46,900 --> 06:11:50,900
I'm just a dork at this point when they when you see my full outfit. I'm like step on me mommy

3422
06:11:52,020 --> 06:11:57,300
Like I'll fucking long my life. I can't get over how long my legs are because it's very fun funny proportions

3423
06:11:58,020 --> 06:12:00,020
um

3424
06:12:08,180 --> 06:12:10,180
I

3425
06:12:10,180 --> 06:12:12,180

Oh, I just got back from the office. Do you have dinner ready?

3429
06:12:28,260 --> 06:12:32,740
What are you talking about? You don't have dinner ready. I asked you to put the chicken out before I left for work

3430
06:12:33,620 --> 06:12:35,300
Some brother you are

3431
06:12:35,300 --> 06:12:38,340
Now you know I have to punish you. Oh, great

3432
06:12:43,620 --> 06:12:45,620
Yeah, I don't show the

3434
06:12:48,260 --> 06:12:50,260
I have legs for days

3435
06:12:51,220 --> 06:12:53,860
But do you want us to call him? I don't really care either way

3436
06:12:56,020 --> 06:12:59,220
You too could have that I'm very good at improv

3437
06:12:59,220 --> 06:13:05,380
You just remind me of a real person that's kind of messed up, but I forgive you what?

Your honor, I think it's mad. I'm so stick with that

3439
06:13:13,460 --> 06:13:16,020
I think madam is talented enough to do it all

3440
06:13:16,980 --> 06:13:19,140
Dom's can care about their subs. That is true

3441
06:13:20,020 --> 06:13:25,460
because don't like I I dom and sub relationship is all about trust and communication

3442
06:13:26,420 --> 06:13:29,620

You're a whore

3463
06:15:11,460 --> 06:15:13,460
Is 20 not a divisible of five

3464
06:15:13,700 --> 06:15:15,700

06:15:48,820 --> 06:15:51,140
Just stay in particular. I just need to end

3469
06:15:51,940 --> 06:15:56,420
I don't know why I just have to I can't explain it. I have to end on a divisible

3470
06:15:56,500 --> 06:15:58,500
I just really like divisible to five

3471
06:15:59,620 --> 06:16:01,620
Yeah, well, I do have OCD. So yeah

3472
06:16:04,420 --> 06:16:10,820
