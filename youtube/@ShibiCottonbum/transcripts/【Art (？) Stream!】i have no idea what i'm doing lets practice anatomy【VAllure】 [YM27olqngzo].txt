Why am I being complimented so much?
Did you guys do something wrong?
I feel like are you sucking up to me?
Yeah, yeah, I don't know if I trust you.
I don't know, hmm, suspicious.
You might be wondering why am I holding my leash like this?
I'm drawing with it, don't worry about it.
It's a skill that takes years to master, but I have done so.
How was the bed?
Oh, it was so good.
Such great bed.
I'm sorry, I'm eating almonds.
It was so good.
I didn't think it would be different.
Lying on the floor versus lying on a bed frame.
The leash has a drawing feature.
It draws you closer to me, so I can choke you out.
How the almonds activated?
What does that mean?
There's blue diamond honey roasted almonds.
Right on the floor of this one.
It's really good handwriting. Are you lying to me?
Oh, am I? Okay, great.
I'm not actually...
Thank you for the soup, ma'am.
The only thing I did wrong was staring at your fuzzangas,
and I feel no shame.
One, thank you.
Two, I didn't know you could thumbs up a soup.
It's a meme from a cookbook? Oh, okay.
Yeah, I have really stupid chicken scratch handwriting.
I think it's pretty. Thank you.
I think it looks... I like to think that it looks like
artsy, quirky, like manic pixie dream girl handwriting.
You know, like, you know, yeah.
I'm so happy I finished what I was doing before on time.
I thought I was going to be late again.
That wouldn't be the first time.
Yeah, we have an engine drill.
What's I doing before?
Umm...
Just stuff.
I don't really know.
It was just... I don't know.
It took me a while to figure out, like, something...
to do.
Probably say, are you-

When I was in middle school and high school or elementary school, I don't know what to call it for you, European friends, but whatever.
I also have some goldfishies.
But I wanted to go for illustration.
I actually wanted to be a comic book artist.
That was when I was really obsessed with Marvel.
I wasn't good.
Excuse me, will you draw one of your old OCs?
That's a good idea.
Although, I mostly had male OCs because I was a very horny teenager, so.
With goldfish, just the regular kind.
Do I have any old drawings or so?
Sadly, no.
My art is lost to the ages.
I wish there was one sketchbook that I did a lot of my art studies.
I had some really good nose studies, hand studies, I remember.
Mouth and eye studies.
And then I loved drawing like, just like figure drawing like masculine and feminine forms like draped over furniture or having stuff draped on them.
But I did used to draw a lot.
But again, I haven't drawn in such a long time.
Hot boy OCs make them kiss.
Trust me, sis.
I made them kiss.
But draw one of your hair.
I don't remember a lot.
I was also never good at like, I only drew like traditionally.
I'm not good at digital art.
I only ever drew traditionally.
I think I might have like some old deviant art full of like warrior cat OCs.
But I don't know.
I can't remember what the name of it is.
Could you draw a crowd?
Of course I could.
Aren't you here?
Aren't you all here right now?
Who is Legolius?
I mean Legolius and Danny Phantom.
But yeah, so I'm like, like Emmy and Azura have inspired me to like practice drawing more.
Cause I'm, you know, like how powerful you are when you can draw yourself as a VTuber.
I'm like, I could draw the craziest shit.
But I can't do that right now.
I'm not drawing crazy shit for the stream.
But like in the future, it would be cool if I could.
I also want to learn like color theory and stuff.
Cause I never colored.
I only like painted and did like pastels, like chalk pastels and wax pastels.
I'm trying to think what else.
I'm like looking over, cause like I have a sketchbook, but I never drew in it.
I bought a sketchbook like I'm going to draw again.
Like months ago did not draw on it.
She'd be drawing herself for the certified.
Yes.
Um, but I wish I really wish I kept up with that skill, especially now being a VTuber.
They always say being an artist is a useless skill.
That's not fucking true in VTubing.
It's a great skill.
My goal would be, it would be really cool to become a VTuber mama for someone.
Um, although I know what goes into that.
It's not just the art.
You also have to know how to cut it up and separate layers and do all that shit.
Um, but it would be cool to learn that stuff.
Um, but for now we're just going to practice our anatomy.
Um.
Sippy sip.
Um, thank you to you guys.
Um, I put a tablet on my throne like when I first started cause I did, you know, anticipate
wanting to do a drawing stream.
Um, but, uh, so thank you for all your support.
There's a, you guys don't understand how happy I get when you guys give me a gift
for my throne.
So my, um, I haven't gone downstairs yet to go get it.
Sorry, I'm putting my tablet on my desk and moving stuff out of the way.
Maybe I should get like a tablet stand.
Um, but like my vacuum was delivered and you guys don't know, I'm like, wow, I am
truly a hag.
If I'm so excited to have a vacuum, I'm like, yes, I have a bed frame.
Yes, I have a vacuum.
Now I can really suck.
It's just, it's, I'm so hag maxing.
It's, it's ridiculous.
Um, but cause my other one is like really cheap.
I want to go off of Amazon and it broke and my cats kick litter everywhere
with their little stinky little litter paws.
So I'm probably, I'm going to get a leave after stream, go downstairs to my
mail room and get that and dance the night away cleaning my house because
that's how messed up I am.
Okay.
Let me see.
I just want to make sure everything is.
Did you enjoy your pre stream almonds?
Hope the stream goes well.
Thank you for the tip of day.
Yeah, my almonds are very tasty.
Um, dancing in the mail.
No, shut up.
Shut up, dude.
Um, the postal mail room, you fucking dweeb.
I'm trying to put my headphones on.
What?
I have like a chunk of cat hair in my headphones.
Okay.
Um, I got paint tool sigh.
I also used to draw on paint tool sigh, but I don't remember how to.
Is there a way so that you guys can?
Okay.
You guys can see my cursor.
Cool.
So yeah, welcome.
Wow.
I can't hear my own music.
Good.
That's some good good good background.
No, no, no.
Don't give him attention.
Don't give him attention.
Pay attention to me.
Okay.
Yeah, I was like, it was too quiet.
I realized.
What would you listen to watch when you used to draw more?
Um, I was a little emo bitch and so I would either just watch like anime or I
would just listen to really like MSI and mine and what's it called?
Um, Hollywood on dad and be like, oh, I hate my life.
If only there were these people that were real.
Okay.
So I'll tell you like who my who some of my OCs were.
Um, I had a lot of soul leader OCs bus Hollywood on dad album.
Oh, that's hard.
Hold on.
I have to look up what they look like because I usually only go by album art.
I never remember album names.
Hello and then album.
No, not the who.
No, not Hollywood albums.
Jesus fuck.
Ah, swan songs.
Although I did like notes from the, oh wait, but American tragedy.
I haven't listened to any of like their newer stuff.
Because what was our newest thing?
I don't even, you haven't listened to a new empire or day of the dead.
Born here's a who.
No, my actually didn't listen to my chemical romance growing up.
I really didn't.
If it's anything but American tragedy, I won't cry.
Um, new EP's are good.
Okay.
I'm able to change your marks.
Oh, yay.
Good.
But um, yeah.
So, uh, so I had like my, let me see, I'll try to draw her.
So I had my OC who was a self insert.
I need to, I don't know how to use this tablet, but I know there's a zoom feature.
Is there, is that how you do it?
No.
Oh, fuck.
I'm zooming on the chat.
Okay.
Um, I don't know how to use paint tool side either.
So, uh, her name was Kiri.
Or Kiritan.
I don't, I can't remember the last name I gave her.
I'd have to like go back and look at like, oh wow, this is so pixelated because
the thing, we can't even see what you can't even see what I'm drawing.
Hold on.
Um, Jesus, fuck.
I don't know how to, I didn't know how to like properly capture this.
So Kiri, uh, she was my master OC.
Let me see how big is this?
That's pretty big.
Um, and she was like typical, like Japanese school girl outfit from what I can remember.
Um, oh, it's just Kiri.
It's just Kiri and she, it's funny.
Now that I think of it, she has like scrawny's hairstyle.
Cause she had like the bangs and like the little thing.
And then, but then I always gave her, uh, she had two ponytails on top or whatever the fuck.
I'm not like trying hard.
And then I gave her like super long hair on the bottom.
Cause I really liked Tamari from, um, from Naruto.
So Kiri is Scottish.
No.
Um, and she was, she had pink hair.
She had pink hair and I'm trying to, to be honest, I don't think I made her tan.
I think I just made her white cause I didn't have like, I don't think I had any tan OC's not to think about it.
Um, yeah, I don't, I don't know why and she had like blue eyes.
I think I can't remember that much.
But she was pretty chill.
She was kind of a whiny bitch from what I remember.
I just like really made her whiny and she was horny all the time.
Sorry, I heard my neighbor going by.
So that's my pause.
And I remember I gave her freckles.
Um, but yeah, she was, she was, she was chill.
She was cool.
Yeah.
Cause she was a self-insert and I couldn't, I just lived vicariously through her.
I can't even remember the outfit cause I gave her like the, you know, little bo shit.
And then she had like a, oh hello mother.
Um, I drew her in a lot of different outfits, but mostly she was in like a Japanese schoolgirl outfit.
I'll have to like look to check my email and see if, um, there's anything there.
How are you doing reeflings?
How are you doing?
How was time with strongy Elden Ring?
I need to add Elden Ring to my schedule next week.
Um, but yeah, she was chill.
I'm just literally going to lazily have her put her hands on her hips.
Yeah, whatever the fuck you guys get it.
Um, she was cool.
You know, always had to have the thigh highs.
Those were, you know, all the rage.
It looks adorable.
Oh yeah, she was, I loved her a lot.
She was like my pride and joy.
And then she had her, um, I will literally, I remember I drew like a really fucking sick picture of her with her scythe.
Cause her scythe was modeled kind of after Haydn's and she had like the three.
Um, I forget.
I think I had like an, wasn't an eyeball or like a mouth.
I can't remember.
Um, or like three dots.
I can't call.
And then there was my boy, my pride, my joy.
James Sinner, who was a little, wait, I put his bang on the wrong side.
I think every which side it was on and he was, um, yeah, it was definitely the side cause I always put his dots.
And he was, uh, little sick, nasty bro, little meme edge lord.
Uh, he was a ginger and, uh, cause I had a weird fascination with gingers at the time.
I don't know why.
Um, and I usually would just make like fix of him.
And then I had another OC, um, it's a reference to Johnny sins.
No, I like, I don't even know why I like named him Sin.
Cause he just like his real name was James Sinner, but he just went by sin.
And then he had his, he had three beauty marks under his eye.
That was like his thing.
Um, um, so ginger is a size.
Yeah, exactly.
Welcome in.
Welcome in.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Enjoy the emotes.
Um, yeah, he was a major edge lord.
Um, and then I had, uh, zero.
I can't use like an Android and I usually just like, I was in my fujoshi era.
So I literally just make sin in zero.
Just like fuck all the time.
This reminds me of solar.
Yeah.
Cause this is my soul eater OC soul eater.
She was my master and sin was the weapon.
Um, and then I can't remember.
I remember it was very elaborate for zeros here because he also had a fucking
banging and it went like that or some fuck.
I don't fucking know.
Um, and he was like very coup d'etre.
Hello.
Hello.
We all the character was here.
Oh yeah.
His name was zero.
And then you had to do that.
You had to do.
Yeah.
Also I was very like into scenes, scene culture.
So they all had like seen related stuff.
Um, and then there was zero.
My booby itching.
Um, and he was like very coup d'etre.
He like hated his life.
He would like whatever was like, oh gross.
Um, he also, he was albino cause you know, he had to have one OC have white hair and red eyes.
So that's what he was.
Um, and then there was, uh, I had some like teen Titan OC's.
So there was, um, fuck, I think how did his hair go?
Fuck.
Then there was Dante.
I think his hair was like swoopy.
Again, they all had fucking seen hair don't come for me.
And he was like, he could, um, shape shift just like Beast Boy cause I like Beast Boy.
He was cool.
And then his girlfriend was this chick named Addison.
She was just like a normie, but she was like very like preppy.
Yeah.
Raven.
Um, I'm going to laugh hysterically if like my childhood friend that I made all these OC's with like watches this sometime in the future.
And it was like, what the fuck?
Wait, I know these people cause we would role play all the time.
Um, and Addison was like really cute.
She was like your typical preppy girl.
And it's funny.
Oh, by the way, Dante had like, um, black hair and then like a red highlight.
Yeah, Addison, she was sweet.
She was cute.
She usually would have like a bow in her hair, some shit.
And her hair was like blonde and long.
Um, oh, I think I had, remember did Dante have a cool sword?
No, Dante usually would just shape shift into something and try to kill you.
Um, black hair.
Yeah, definitely.
Um, and then I also, cause you guys know I had a fixation with Hikaru and Kauru from Oran High School Host Club cause twincest is twincest.
Um, so I made my own characters named Romeo and Julian.
And they were toys.
And they were just, you know, pretty much a copy of Hikaru and Kauru.
Um, I can't remember what their hair was.
I think like one had like hair going up and then one had a hair going up this way.
I don't fucking know.
Let's just pretend.
Um, and then, um, I'm trying to think of my other female characters cause they had more.
It wasn't just Addison.
Oh my God, what the fuck was her name?
There was one other girl that I used to draw all the time besides Kiri and Addison.
Uh, Julian and Romeo.
And then I don't know why Addison is in zero, but you know.
Um, and then a nameless girl that I can't remember, but she was there too.
She was like my evil OC.
I can't, I think she had like, maybe I didn't, she was tan cause I think she had like a fro or like really big hair at least.
Oh, let me give her some eyelashes.
But yeah, so I had, I had a lot.
I had more than this.
I just literally can't remember them.
I probably had like 17.
Mika Boshi, what?
Can you blame her for being in zero?
Um, but yeah, I'm just, I'm just, I'm literally just scribbling.
Um, but yeah, that was a little insight into my twisted mind.
But I would totally, and when I was, um, before I, uh, became my PL,
I was actually debating to name myself Kiri.
Um, I was Kiri light something.
I don't know, Kiri, cause it was like cut, cause Kiri means cut.
I don't know if I did like something like terrible, like cut self.
Um, which one dated Clary on the witch boy?
Oh, hold on.
Let me draw you her.
That was missy.
So I also, I might, I'll try to hunt it down.
I don't know if I have it.
I did not hunt.
I don't, I didn't really like Sonic that much.
I liked young justice, teen Titans, uh, Naruto.
Soul leader.
I'm trying to think of what other things I like made self insert OCs for.
Oh yeah.
But like usually I would just stick Kiri in like multiple scenarios.
I saying this out loud makes me sound so fucking crazy.
Oh, but yeah, I liked, I don't like the new young justice.
I didn't watch that.
I like the first and like the second season and I'm like, I'm good.
Um, but so my OC for, um, that for young justice, I have to remember what she looks like.
Her name was missy chief and she went by miss.
That's fucking clever.
I am.
Wow.
You're mentioning coldly.
Oko just activated me like a fucking sleeper agent.
Um, she again, I also, I just really like ponytail is just like scrawny.
So she had, um, she was very much modeled after jinx from teen Titans.
Um, I almost gave her the same powers, but, uh, she had like,
I think like big giant fucking huge pony tails.
If I can recall.
Welcome.
Welcome to being a member.
Um, but it sounds very British.
I wish I'm missy chief.
Yeah.
She was just a total, uh, what's it called?
What is it called when they just like wear a lot of bronzer jinx from Hickman.
No, jinx from teen Titans.
Um, and then again, you had to have the baying.
You always had to have the baying, you know, the baying was a necessary, necessary thing.
Um, but I remember, I can't really remember what her outfit was.
Uh, I think like it was definitely.
Whoa, what the fuck is up with that?
Um, she definitely, I think I gave her like some really short shorts.
And she had naturally had like striped thigh highs and then I think I gave her like, it was like a crop top.
And then she had like finger gloves or whatever.
I'm just going to, um, I'm just going to, yeah, she's going to have little Barbie hands right now.
Um, and then she had a little striped fingerless gloves.
Oh shit.
I don't know how to use this thing yet.
And then she had like high boots or whatever the fuck.
Let me wait.
It's too big.
It's too big.
I won't fit.
Um, yeah.
Damn.
She's starting to look like fucking Ashley.
Um, but yeah, so she was cool.
She could shape shift, but when she shape shift, she could take on the powers met momentarily of the people.
I don't know why I'm making her look so devious.
So I guess what can you expect?
Um, she would take on the powers of the person.
I think she had like touch them.
I don't know.
It was like rogue shit.
I don't know.
But yeah, that was her.
And I can't remember.
Did she have a tail?
No, I can't remember if I gave her like cat ears and a tail just to have an excuse to draw a girl like to make anything a cat girl.
I would.
This is drawing actually represented proportions.
Now in hindsight, I realize I made a lot of my girls like very pet on or pet in.
I don't know how to pronounce it.
Don't come for me.
But like come for me.
But like don't.
Um, so.
But yeah, so I like that.
I made them like really short.
Because again, like what I drew was a lot in like fantasy.
So I'm tall and I have a big to boobies.
So I sometimes would make girls that would like carry definitely like looked like me minus like pink hair.
I might have given her tan skin.
I think I did.
And then like love her.
And then like blue eyes and shit.
And then all the other characters I would make usually were like white or and then like short.
I can't.
I think I may carry like five three.
I don't even remember.
But just me drew cute funny girls.
No, I didn't really know what cute and funny was back then.
Um, but yeah.
So.
But yeah.
So like that was that's a little bit of insight.
And to my drawing history.
Again, as you can see, I scribble.
I'm not good.
If I kind of really wish I had that sketchbook because then I would show you and you guys would be like what the fuck happened.
And I'd be like, yeah.
Coming for.
Honestly, I was like super tempted.
Because when I was cast as she be, I was debating whether or not like as a sketchbook.
Because when I was cast as she be, I was debating whether or not like as a like little inside joke with myself to make some of my like genderbend my OCs and make them people that work in wonderland that you can like interact with.
But then you guys said you wanted to be like the people who work there.
So I'm like, okay, that's fine.
But I think I just it would be really cool.
Maybe at some point in the distant distant future, a little visual novel where you like go to work for wonderland.
That would be actually and then like you can run into Mike genderbend OCs or something.
Something something visiting guests.
Yes.
It should be to the curious.
Oh my God, I literally have to that's going to bother me.
I can't remember her fucking last name.
We're real though.
Um, okay.
So if most of your OCs are flat, that's your chance to redesign them, right?
But it's like I like flat.
I like medium is pretty but like I like all sizes to be not of them like really thinking about it.
I used to like hate small boobs.
But I've I think because it's becoming a Vtuber.
I've appreciated small booba, you know, I think it's I think they're like, and then like seeing it on like real life girls.
I'm like, wow, like that really suits your figure.
I'm not I swear.
I'm not like skeezily checking out women.
But I'm just like, usually, again, because I used to draw a lot, I would look at someone and I would be like, wow, like I would love to draw you because of the way that your body flows or your facial structure.
Small or large, they all carry ups and drinks.
You appreciate them knowing they don't cause much back pain.
Yes, exactly.
And like, I think like if I didn't have arthritis, I don't like because I have arthritis in my neck and in my shoulders.
I feel like if I didn't have it, I would be okay with my size.
But because like, it just like, extraneously puts more pressure on that, it makes me in more pain.
I would I would like eat.
But yeah, you can skeezily check me out.
I'm skeezily checking you all out right now.
Wow, you look really nice.
Let me draw you like one of my harlots.
If only I could hold them for you.
I wish you would.
I wish you I wish I could have like a hair member at all times just like be my bra.
Because even when you wear a bra, they still it still puts pressure on your shoulders because your shoulders are supporting it.
So it's like when if someone were to like lift it up, you just I feel so like I'm doing that right now.
I'm holding up my booba and minus the weight in my hands.
I feel so weightless right now.
I'm like, I'm absentmindedly sticking out my chest because my posture is corrected.
Yeah, there's like, there's good browsers, bad bras.
Like it's whatever your bra, your foot still your waiter.
Yes, I also need you guys to make my bed for me.
Thank you.
Like Aphrodite in record.
Yes, exactly.
Someone sent me a picture of that.
And I'm like, I remember I watched that scene and I was like, oh my God, I need that.
Like Piccolo taking the training weeks.
Yeah, or like Rock Lee.
But yeah, no, but like if I didn't have to, I like if anything like a reduction.
So I'd be like, like a nice like a medium is premium, you know, how much do you pay per hour?
I pay you in whippings.
Piccolo isn't all the time.
Make your bed, but it won't make mine.
If you don't make your own bed, how can I trust you to make mine?
Because then your bed making skills are probably shit.
How many whips per hour?
It depends on the hour.
Depends on the mood I'm feeling.
Like two whips an hour.
Maybe like three.
I like things that are odd numbers because OCD.
Um, but okay, so guys, give me a pose.
I will look up a reference.
And no, I can't draw that.
Jack, what does that mean?
Let me talk to the hair union rep and I'll get back to you.
No, I'm not Jojo posing the guys.
You're not helpful.
What's the jackal?
Okay, I need to look this up.
Jack.
Oh, pose.
Oh, I was wondering what the name of that was because I wanted to get art of me with that pose.
Wait, what?
What characters is from?
A in the lobster?
Oh, guilty gear.
I never played guilty gear, but I love the character designs in guilty gear.
I'm actually like really fucking feeling.
I kind of want to try to see if I can do that right now.
I bet I can.
I bet I can do that.
I bet I'm going to try it.
I mean, I get up and try it.
You don't look at me like that.
This out of the way.
Because sometimes it's like good to like really do the pose reference yourself so you can get into that headspace.
So like if I just, okay.
Oh yeah, this is easy with the fuck.
Oh, oh.
I can jiggle my ass too.
Perfect.
Oh fuck.
Oh my koochie.
Okay.
Let me fix my pillow so I can sit down properly.
She got the body.
I got the body, otty, otty, otty.
You know, when I went to my rheumatologist, they had to do an x-ray on my neck to check out how my arthritis was.
And they were like, wow, for your age, you're more flexible than most.
And I'm like, what's that mean?
And then they're like, oh yeah, by the way, your arthritis got worse.
It's in your other side of the neck.
And your neck, it doesn't have a natural curve.
It's straighter than it should be.
And I'm like, excuse me.
So get that checked out.
Your neck doesn't curve properly.
You usually can get arthritis as I crack my neck into the mic.
For your age, I'm 56.
Exactly.
I'm pretty flexible for 56.
You guys don't believe me that I'm 56.
I'm so sorry.
Okay.
Let me see.
I need to pull up.
I don't think I'm going to be able to draw this, actually.
I can do it, but I can't think I can draw it.
Let me make this smaller.
You sound 56.
Fuck you.
56 years young.
Yeah, don't forget it.
Okay.
So I usually, so I also usually draw on my iPad.
I don't, I use procreate, which is the dumbest name for an app ever.
I usually use procreate when I do doodle.
But I definitely want to try drawing on this tablet.
It's a, I've only ever used Wacom tablets,
but this is a Huon Huon.
I don't know how to pronounce it.
You guys know I can never pronounce anything.
56.
Yeah.
I'm 56 million dollars in debt to the casino of Las Vegas.
Procreate is really good.
Yeah.
Procreate's amazing to be honest with you.
So yeah, I usually sketch in red first.
Wait, I want to make sure you guys can see what I'm drawing.
Perfect.
I'm looking at a reference and it's covering my OBS.
So they have like their shoulders like so in their neck.
You can't really see.
And then you kind of push up their butt and their hips are like right here.
And you got like boom knee, boom knee.
This looks so crazy foot.
Wait, I can't see where her other leg is.
Yeah, let's go.
Fabulous.
Okay.
And then she has her arms like on the ground.
You can figure out what that is, right?
Like I don't, I don't know.
Clip Studio Master Race.
I don't have Clip Studio.
Why don't you buy Clip Studio for me?
I also don't think I'm going to spend money on Clip Studio when I can barely draw.
I don't know.
And then usually, how do I do another layer?
Okay.
Those line work layers, what the fuck?
Can I change the opacity?
How do I, oh.
Then I kind of like lighten that shit up a little bit.
Again, I'm no professional.
Then I'll usually go in with blue to get like the form.
Sorry, I'm looking at her circle and then I kind of connect everything.
Kind of already fucked this up, but it's fine.
I make big boobies pancake on the ground.
I can't do that.
I can't draw hands.
If you could draw hands, you're a witch.
All right.
So just saying.
I usually do just like little, little mitts.
Little oven mitts.
All right.
Perfect.
Yes.
And then they got their, she has a long ass torso.
I do just want to say that.
Holy fuck.
This looks terrifying.
Her back kind of, I kind of need to put the shoulders like.
Kind of lasso to the list of you.
Oh no, it's fine.
I don't really care if I cut off the fingies.
A little closer.
Fabulous.
Wow.
You know, that's what this is what we do here.
We just, we really just want to let you have those horror vibes.
I don't know how people draw this pose because that's like.
Like hello.
Like this.
No, no, no, no.
Okay.
I'm getting ahead of myself.
Yeah.
That looks a little bit better.
It's like, it doesn't really look like it's sloping in though.
It's like the back isn't as sloped as it should be.
I'm literally looking at a jackal pose.
Like I'm looking at that as a reference right now.
Why is there?
I made the mistake of looking at Thanos jackal pose.
Oh man.
Oh man.
Yeah, it's I made the arch two bit because like in.
In that game and in Guilty Gear, like whatever this is from.
Um, they have a way longer torso proportion.
My cat is like using the litter box proportionately.
So let me actually kind of not go by their proportions.
I might go by Thanos's proportions.
Let me just look at that and real fast.
Because Thanos is like this and then.
Yeah, thank you Thanos.
Oh, Thanos, you're so helpful.
Thank you.
Yeah, it's as good as it's going to get.
Wow.
This kind of looks like a horse.
And then foot.
And then foot.
Perfect.
I think that came out good.
I think that came out pretty nice.
I'm gonna.
I'm gonna.
Can I hold on?
How do I delete a layer?
Can I just delete a layer?
Okay, I guess I can't.
Oh wait, there's a trash.
Okay.
And then I'm going to move this guy over here.
We'll start on our next pose.
So this is pretty good.
We got the jackal pose.
I'll put the jackal pose off to the side.
You can see it's head poking out.
The cami stretch from Street Fighter.
Okay, hold on, let me look that up.
Okay, I think I know which one.
I just need to see it.
It's when she's lifting up her leg.
Oh no, it's not.
What the fuck is this pose?
I thought it was one.
There's like, there's like one.
I like how the jackal pose still shows up
because they compare it to the cami stretch.
Damn, what the fuck is this stretch?
Okay, I have to do it myself.
Hold on.
Damn, her back is like a table.
Damn, how the fuck does she do that?
This feels nice.
Hold on, let me crack my back.
Ooh, did you hear that?
Oh, sorry, it's my back.
Oh, sorry, it's my old bones.
My old, old bones.
That was my hip, don't tell anybody.
I still have the Thanos pose open.
Cami street fighter pose.
Oh my god, that's so fucking small.
Okay.
Why is it so small?
I can't see this.
Okay, that's big enough.
Cool, okay, I need an almond.
Time for the hip back complete.
Is that maybe your gelf?
Yeah.
I'm not a milf, I'm a kill.
My eyesight has been folding since I've been born.
You prefer cokers good?
Okay, so.
Do this on a new layer.
So, see, this isn't that bad.
This one, oh, I'm not on pencil.
This one.
I can't see where I'm drawing because I need a third screen.
So, you got the head, oh fuck, you got the head.
That's so big.
Head.
I need to like back up a little bit.
There we go.
All you see is like the jackal pose in the corner.
Please hold on for money.
We love, yeah, you better love hags in this house.
Madam, see these money, bro, I'm broke.
Don't even.
I got so much debt to pay off.
Because of my own medical bills from being elderly.
And then fees medical bills.
I hate the American healthcare system.
I need another drink.
Can one of you guys get me a seltzer water for my fridge?
Okay.
So, she's kind of like looking up.
And then her...
Hold on, I cannot see that.
Damn, her shoulders are like fucking dislocated.
I'm like realizing how little range and motion I have
because of my fucking...
I need to go to a chiropractor.
I just hurt my shoulder.
Okay.
And then she kind of, her neck's like there.
I'm gonna draw some big old boobies.
That actually will help me though.
Now that I think about it.
Because if her chest is like this...
Yeah, Reina.
Reina, what?
Reina, please.
Reina, are you spitting facts?
Okay.
And then her shoulders are like up here.
And then...
I can't tell where her elbows are.
I think they're like near her ears.
And then hand...
Wait.
Yeah.
Hand.
Hand.
And then you just travel through...
Reina!
Are you good?
Ma'am.
Reina, come here.
Who are you talking to?
Is it the demon again?
I'm alone.
They're trying to chill.
Yeah.
Come on.
Reina.
Okay.
She's sorry.
She's gonna keep talking to the demons.
Reina!
She's cat coming senile?
No.
She's already...
She is 14.
But...
What the fuck am I doing with these hips?
Okay, her legs are spread.
That sounds funny.
You gotta get the ill thigh gap in there, you know?
Whoa.
Exactly.
Reina.
Oh.
You brought me something?
Yeah, thank you.
Hi, Reina.
Wake up.
You just wanna hang out?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Are you...
Are you spitting facts?
She brought the seltzer water.
She did.
She did.
She brought me the seltzer water.
Reina.
Hi.
She's very helpful.
Reina, do you wanna say hi to my chat?
She's just rubbing against the microphone.
Can you say hi?
Can you...
No, can you say hi?
Reina.
Can you say hi?
She's just rubbing against the microphone.
Reina.
Hey, lady.
What are you doing?
She is looking my arm.
Okay.
Her name is spelt rain than an A.
I'm not in the mood for taking a...
She doesn't wanna talk to you guys.
She'll purr for you, but she won't...
Oh, she's on my shoulder now.
All right.
Do you wanna purr for chat?
Can purr for chat?
I don't know if you guys can hear that.
Oh, my God.
I need to brush you.
Jesus, fuck.
You were shedding so much.
Reina is a queen.
So it actually fits that the Spanish spelling of her name means queen.
Reina.
Reina.
She's the queen of the house.
I need to brush.
She's 14 years old.
Bumi and Fia are both one year.
They just turned one year in March and April.
Respectively.
Come brush me, save Reina.
Reina is named after...
I used to really love America's Next Top Model,
and there was a model named Reina,
and she was so pretty and had really pretty blue eyes.
So I named Reina after her.
And then it just worked.
You could probably Google it.
Bunny drawing Pony.
What?
Reina like from Fire Emblem like Vietnam.
Fia is from Elden Ring.
Bumi is from...
Avatar The Last Airbender.
And then Soleil was also...
Because I wanted like a theme for like the elements.
Soleil like Soleil.
She passed away years ago,
but Soleil was like Fire.
Reina is like Water.
Bumi's Earth.
And then I couldn't think of anything for air.
So Fia was just Fia.
I say senile as a possibility for a cat at 14.
No, she's actually pretty all there.
So cats will do this thing where when they have a toy,
they like to announce to people they caught something.
Because they think you don't eat,
and so she was calling everybody to come get food.
This is essentially what she was doing.
Fia is light.
Fia, technically Fia's full name is Fiala.
Because I think in like Czech,
Fiala means violet,
and Fia's skin like around her ears is purple and not pink.
Actual Warrior Cats fan.
Yes, that's me.
But yeah, Reina likes to bring stuff to me,
and I'll usually have like my toys,
her favorite toys are in my bed because she'll bring them to me.
I got her cat stairs in anticipation of my new bed frame.
She likes to take the cat stairs,
and the cat stairs also has a bed inside,
and Fia likes to sleep in there.
I'll take a picture after stream,
because I bet she's in there right now.
And Reina is like desperately hugging me.
What's up?
You just want to be snuggled?
I was snuggling with you all morning.
I'm really craving like spicy chicken.
Oh fuck.
Oh my god.
Okay, I'm going to brush you while I talk to chat.
How about that?
Because you are shit.
You still brush me.
Oh no!
I brought my bed.
She's still purring in my arms.
Over here.
Purr is harder.
Yeah, big mama.
I know you like the brushes.
Spicy chicken from where?
I don't know.
I just don't like really crispy spicy chicken right now.
Sorry, I'm just focusing brushing my cat.
She's like shedding so much,
because it's so much.
Although Simon's cats don't really shed,
but like Reina sheds a lot.
She's always shed a lot for some reason.
Other cats don't shed that much.
I'm drawing while I was drawing
the campy street fighter stretch.
Just like me getting strung by she for real for real.
Now she's trying to escape me.
Where are you going?
Where are you going, miss ma'am?
Oh my gosh, there's so much cat here on this brush.
Yeah, just hang out.
I can't wait to use the vacuum later,
because you're covering cat hair,
and it's everywhere.
I self-insert as Reina.
Yeah, I'm just brushing you.
I don't know if you can even hear the brushing noises.
Oh my gosh.
I have one of those blood brushes
you can click in a little like...
What's it called?
Show all the hair that you got.
I'll take a picture of the hair that just came off Reina,
and you guys will be like, what the hell?
And mind you, I brush her very often.
She just sheds a lot, because I think she's older.
You're going bald, old woman.
No, I'm kidding. She doesn't even look like she's old.
She's 14, but she looks like she's a 5-year-old cat.
Yeah, let me get some booty cheeks.
She's not even fluffy.
They're short-haired cats.
I've never owned a long-haired cat.
Oh yeah, you liking it, huh, mami?
Wholesome cat brushing.
56.
I think in cat ears, Reina is actually like 72.
But she's still spry.
The other cats, she keeps up with them.
Some great ASMR.
Young bald woman.
I'm so sorry.
She's not even bald. She's like very...
She's like, she looks perfectly normal.
She was seeing pictures of her in my alt account.
You'll see that she just looks like a normal cat.
But she's like signies.
I can't wait to sneeze later.
Yay.
It came for the arts.
It came for the brushing ASMR.
It's not my fault that my stream got derailed by my lovely old cat
who just wants to be brushed.
She's enjoying herself and she's looking up at me with love in her eyes.
Reina will actually usually be on my lap.
Reina will actually usually be on my lap during a lot of streams
because she is my soul kitty.
So she just likes to be near me at all times.
And also when she knows that I'm stressed out from playing a game
she'll come and see me.
Okay, I'm going to take a picture of these giant pieces of fuzz
that just came off of Reina and I'll show you guys.
Oh fuck, I need to plug my phone in. It's almost dead.
I need a dry can of the picture.
And then I'll take a picture of her on my lap.
She's just chilling.
Ew.
And it's funny because I wear a lot of black
and so it's just usually Reina's hair on me.
Okay, Reina, I'm going to put you down now, okay?
He's like, no, mother.
Please, mother, no.
You've forsaken me.
Does he know about the alt?
I don't think he knows about the alt, boys.
Reina looks like it just killed her family
because they put her on the floor.
Reina, why do you have that look on your face?
I just totally threw you to the wolves.
Throw me to the wolves and I'll come back pregnant.
No, I didn't mean to start recording the video.
I wish someone would treat me like she treats her cats.
Yes, I love my kitties.
I treat my cats with the utmost care.
Here in my world.
Okay, Reina, you need to move.
She's like, let me sit exactly where your chair goes.
I still need to get a shelter.
Because Reina left it on the floor.
Reina, can you pass me that seltzer water that you brought me?
She slipped her tail.
Okay, fine, I'll get it myself.
There's cat hair all over my tablet.
I'll get it myself.
Some spicy seltzer water.
I usually call it seltzer water, spicy water.
Anyways, let's get back on track, sorry.
And then she got some...
Wait, I'm always terrible with proportions for legs.
So it's like that.
Koochie.
Koochie.
Five butt fang.
This kind of looks like horse legs, but don't worry about it.
She has such wide fucking hips.
I didn't make her boobs bigger just for the proportions.
Just so at least people will think this is fetish art.
So it makes at least a little bit of sense.
Perfect.
Okay.
Lovely.
Fabulous.
And then, you know, intertwine the fingers.
Now we're getting somewhere.
The quads go hard.
Okay, so I'll make another layer and I'll put this in blue.
So it's like you can get rid of all that gross sketch.
So she's like kind of looking up.
Might need a darker blue.
So she's kind of looking...
Oh my God.
Looking up.
She's like, you know, perfect booby.
You get a better stabilizer booby.
This looks, you know, pretty good.
You get the free armpit.
I think the first thing I need to do is work on proportions.
Elbow.
Perfect.
Hey man, this looks pretty fabulous.
If I don't mind.
And then you gotta get that gorgeous waistline.
So she's got, yeah, she's got some crazy quads.
I don't know why I gave her a fucking bulge.
She got the ill thigh gap.
She got some butt fangs.
I don't know why I gave her a fucking bulge.
She got the ill thigh gap.
She got some butt fangs.
I don't know why I gave her a fucking bulge.
Who needs knees with thighs like these?
Watermelon don't stand a chance.
But, well, get some definition.
No, I don't like that.
Okay.
And then see it's put her calf over there.
Yeah.
She's too.
You gotta get those oven mitt hands in.
That, you know, that's pretty good.
To be honest with you.
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty bomb.
You know, your belly button.
Behind the jack of all.
Okay, hold on.
Let me delete this.
Look at that.
Gorgeous outline.
This.
Let me shrink her.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Fuck.
I don't know how to use this.
Fuck.
Still not.
I spread her legs too much.
I don't know how to use this.
Fuck.
Fuck.
No, I don't want to cut.
I just want.
Okay.
Deselect.
Just use the lasso tool because God fucking damn.
I just want to move this.
Oh, wait, it's because it's on a different layer.
Whoopsies.
I don't.
I guess I'll just stick her over here.
Oh, you guys can't see what I'm doing.
Why?
All right, we'll move over there.
All right.
What's another.
I did stick her behind the other one.
I don't want point.
I don't know if you guys saw it, but maybe it's a good thing.
Drop.
I can't draw that.
Sometimes that's true.
So that's come out as you should.
Now.
Playing with a boil ball now.
Any JoJo pose, a stick figure.
See, I could do a stick figure.
No more.
What's a momo cute pose?
It's funny when I don't know what pose that is when I've done the thingy.
Okay.
Oh, it's just the fucking heart.
Okay.
Yes, I do know that.
Perfect.
Okay, we'll do that.
Stick figure with big Buzzingas.
Big Buzzingas only.
Okay, so she's really cute.
Okay.
Let's do a new layer.
She so she know you have her.
Her head.
Oh, hello.
Oh, it's because it's fucking still selected.
You have her head.
Okay.
And she's kind of like, oh,
I love you.
The heart.
I'm going to make her looking straight on.
And.
She's got.
Sometimes I get lost in my own BGM.
So no.
Massive, but don't go home.
And she's kind of just.
You are not.
Oh, no.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Wait.
Proportions.
Hello.
Arm proportions.
They don't exist here.
What the fuck am I doing?
Okay, we're going to fuck that up.
Okay, let's just do like the heart here.
Those are the hands.
There we go.
That's better.
And yeah, she's kind of just hanging out standing.
So I guess I'll just make her stand.
Cute.
Adorable.
I kind of made her arms too short, but it's fine.
The bowling.
She's got.
She's doing the heart.
She's.
Listen, I don't know why I love to draw like very exaggerated hourglass figures.
So like.
Leave me alone.
Like.
So like.
Leave me alone.
Like.
I'll make this leg in front.
So we have, you know, a little bit more depth.
This leg will be behind.
And we got to make her a cat girl.
Or actually, this looks like a puppy girl.
So we're going to make her a puppy girl.
She's kind of looking flat.
I haven't gotten to that part yet.
Leave me alone.
Okay.
Let's make a new layer.
Gotta grab blue.
I'm trying very hard.
Okay.
I'm so focused on making sure my anatomy is perfect even to the detriment of my art.
I just don't care right now.
If you haven't noticed, this isn't a serious drawing stream.
And probably all of them I'd ever do will not be serious.
I definitely made her shoulders way too fucking narrow.
It's fine.
Drawing on the wrong fucking layer, Shibi.
Don't worry about it.
She's just a petite gal.
You know?
I just really want to straw boobs right now.
Okay.
I did it.
I did it.
Gotta make her cute puppy ears.
You know?
We'll give her some really fabu hair, you know?
Kind of looks like a poodle.
I'm kind of living for it.
One of my personal pet peeves is when a character is a kemenomumimimi that I can't pronounce,
but they have human fucking ears.
It bothers the fuck out of me.
I used to tease one of my friends.
I don't know if she's still in the chat, Toto,
because she is a tiger and she has tiger ears,
but then she has human ears.
And then she messaged me this morning
and she's just like, guess what?
I'm like, what?
She's like,
Reora Panthera from Hololive has double ears
and I literally almost threw my phone across the room.
Because she has cat ears and she has human ears.
Why do you need more?
Why do you need four ears?
You don't need four ears.
It bothered me so bad.
Like, and really, you prefer double ears?
What is wrong with you?
Are they just vestigial organs then?
Like, which are the ones that you use?
Is better for canonically fake ears and a headband?
Then that's fine.
She does.
She does have double ears.
Yeah, Fuuamoko has double ears.
Wait, Fuuamoko has double ears?
Hold on.
You're lying to me.
You have got to be lying to me.
No, they, no, they don't.
No, they don't.
Wait.
Fuuamoko?
No, they don't.
They don't have double ears.
What the fuck?
How could you lie to me like that?
Well, I just look at so much shit.
They do not.
I just look at so much art.
Their ears are not there.
In looking at their models, their ears are not there.
Serenity has...
Serenity has double ears?
So, I'll spoil something for you.
In my trailer,
I had double ears and I was like,
get those fucking ears out of here.
I hate it.
Because I used to have human ears and I was like,
no, get those fucking ears out.
I hate double ears.
Just cover them with hair where the ears would normally be.
I hate it.
So, like, it's literally one of my pet peeves.
It bothers me.
It turns me off.
How the fuck am I going to draw this other arm?
How the fuck am I going to draw this other arm?
So, I'm seething right now.
I can't believe Mokoko and Fulawa have fucking double ears.
I'm literally so upset.
Butt fangs.
I love me some butt fangs.
When I was doing shit with my model and I took off my skirt,
I was like, yo!
Because I didn't think I had those.
No, I don't hate them.
I'm just, I'm just, I'm not, I'm just disappointed.
I don't hate them.
I'm disappointed.
Okay?
You know what?
She's going to be cupping her booby in this one.
I'm going to do the little puppy girl, puppy girl tail.
Gotta get the puppy girl tail in.
Um...
I don't know how to draw hands, so...
We're going to do...
What the fuck is this thing?
We're going to do the little, we're going to do Lego mitts.
What was that?
Okay.
You know what?
We're just going to stay with how we did this before.
Abulous.
And then I'll get the other fingers kind of in there.
Is there a hand on backwards?
Oh!
Okay, I see what I did.
Technically, this is her pinky and then this should be like shaded.
Cause the thumbs are on the inside.
Don't worry about it.
Her hand's a little bit broken.
Is she's naked?
Um...
Perhaps.
Perhaps.
No, she's not.
She's just wearing a crop top.
Okay.
And it's really short shorts.
She's very cute.
Whoa.
Very cute with some thickum thighs.
I'm like just trying to...
Like make or click her leg back.
How about we just do this?
Yeah, that's fine.
I've never done an art stream.
What the fuck do people do in art streams?
Wow, fabulous.
Oh, we love to see it.
We're not drawing feet.
You guys don't get that for free.
He has legs for days.
Yeah, no feet for you.
You get a little paws.
I'll give you some furry feet.
You can get some furry feet.
Bro, no feet dropped.
Gorgeous.
Am I right or am I right?
Okay, let's put her off to the side.
And now we're gonna try to draw something.
I'm gonna stick you guys on top of each other.
What should we try to draw?
Give me an animal and then a theme.
Like cat, gyaru, dog, goff, crocodile, dundee.
You know what I mean?
Why can't I erase?
Why is it still racing?
What is happening?
I can't erase this.
But I can delete it.
Okay, that's fine.
Bear, e-girl, hotel, travaga, dinosaur, cheerleader, goth ma.
Ooh, I like goth ma.
Slime, bimbo.
It's not him.
It's his cuttlefish.
That actually kind of rhymes with it.
I think about it.
Brab, gyaru, secret agent, platypus.
It's Barry the platypus.
E-girl Barry the platypus, no.
Dear Raver.
I have to go.
I think I'm gonna go with slime, bimbo, because that sounds fun.
Because, you know, I need to get my slime girl fix at some point.
Goth mad scientist.
That's just, that's just Nova from before Mariah.
Hold on.
Let it cook.
Let it cook.
What is this fucking?
Oh.
Yeah.
Noice.
Anyways.
Let's make that brush a little bit smaller.
Slime girl's kind of...
Slime girl's spit.
Well, she made a spit.
Oh, I have to find the art that I made of her.
I think it's on my iPad.
Yeah, it's on my iPad.
I know I posted it on my PL at some point in the evening.
I'll make a slime girl made out of blood.
She's made out of period blood.
Her name was saliva.
She went by live.
Her last name is Hawk Tua.
Live Hawk Tua.
Okay.
Actually, I'm going to do a new canvas because...
Is there a possibility?
I don't know how this shit works.
This is a wrench do.
Okay.
Can I do...
3000?
Cool.
Okay, that looks a little bit better.
Get real close, impersonal.
Wow.
I never done an Australian accent before, but I just did it.
Impressive.
Live Hawk Tua, my new...
Oh, gee.
That's one of my...
That's my slime girl.
All three goes live.
Live Hawk Tua.
Shabee is cooking and almost burned the kitchen.
I was burned the kitchen, not the food.
The kitchen.
Better than Anita's.
Okay.
I'll sketch in light blue.
Just to really get this...
Oh, that's fucking neon.
Never mind.
I can't see that.
Let's go back to red.
Okay, I need...
I'm not used to...
Whoa.
Dude on three.
Okay, I think that's better.
So...
We're making a slime girl.
Oh, see.
She's a bimbo.
Let me get closer.
Real close and personal.
Am I right?
I can't draw eyes.
Or faces.
Or anything for that matter.
Live Hawk Tua is the background character in a show
where we come some sense with.
Live being the jack of...
No!
I'm not drawing a jack of pose.
I'm literally just going to draw a fucking T-pose or some shit.
Again, I can't draw eyes.
So...
Bear with me.
Because I tend to...
If I'm looking at something...
I also really only...
When I did anime-styled characters,
it was either in the cute and funny style
or it was...
Or it was...
What's it called?
Like the soul leader style.
So I guess I'm just going to draw cute and funny bimbo.
Slime girl.
Let's see.
Mm-hmm.
Better be drooling.
Okay, fine.
I'll give her a worse...
A better expression then.
I gotta give her a fucking expression.
Let's see.
This looks like some kind of in her mouth.
Yoiks.
Put the eyes up too high.

Faceless female tight. Oh is there slimes don't have this got hole. Yeah, they you know, that's a good point
They do just got holes
They are just holes
I
Don't know why but I feel like this is gonna turn into like a
Kusugaki bratty expression, okay, I don't like this I feel like it should be bigger
The thing I like about digital art is that I can like drag stuff and make them larger
But I don't know how to do that
How do I make this bigger scale? Oh, no, that's not it
I mean you still I just like what I don't know how to resize something
Let's make the eye closer and more up I suppose
How do I make this bigger edit?
Is that just not a thing that you do and
Whatever I don't care anymore
I
Need to cut it
Drag the corner, what do you mean drag though fuck
Don't worry about it. It's fine. It's fine. It's gonna race this weird fucking thing
Actually, I'll do that
Oh
How to give her like the
Damn, she looks like she's crying
I'm never like satisfied with like specific eye styles
I
Gotta get the big boat lashes in it big boat lashes
Simple is better with those tiny circles. Yeah, I'm kind of feeling the same thing
Cuz this is looks like shit
I prefer like a simpler
Style when it comes to eyes. I realize I just can't do the
Really fancy like eye rendering
And I'll like read about how to do it and shit, but I just can't do it
She looks like a fucking alien cuz her eyes are so far apart
What the hell I hate it
Get rid of it disgusting
I don't know should I go disgusting shit
Try again, we will make the slime girl. I promise you I'm just a very fussy artist
Just kidding. I'm probably lying. I'm probably not gonna draw anything cuz I hate
Anything that I draw
See then I'm like, let's change the eye style up. Shall we you know
and then
Cuz I haven't been able to
I haven't been able to find like a style that I like so that I can teach myself
It looks so amazing before too bad. I don't like it
I
Is is she gonna draw anything this stream? No, she's not
Whatever made you think that
I'm gonna have a blank canvas by the end perhaps
Live I thought this was Hanukkah
She's Jewish now. She's a Jewish slime girl. Okay, like
She's a little melt in a little bit, you know
Let's how about we now focus on the face we just focused on like her hair something
That looks weird. I don't know why she did it like that
So
The hair kind of like goes
Into itself when it comes to like slime girls, so I'm just gonna
I'm I kind I'm kind of feeling a bayang, you know, I think we should do like a like a very like exaggerated
Melty bayang. Yeah
Yeah, I'm feeling that
And then she's like emo she doesn't want to be here
But wait, she's a bimbo. That doesn't really fit the theme
I'm feeling very inspired by like
Elec from nicky
Just want like a little bang moment, you know
I just love like bangs that completely cover the eyes. That's all I can say. I don't know what to tell you
It looks like I'm just drawing a slime ball. So I guess that works
Like her to the wrong ball
And then we'll just like kind of bring it over there we'll just drip a little bit over there, you know a little
A
This looks kind of gross, but you know, that's the best part am I right
It looks definitely like a ball of spit
It looks like something and she may have come you know, we'll never know
Only a select few will know
She's a jar slime. Oh, I like that. She's a bimbo jar slime
Oh god
What have I created? What have we made together? I can't believe you've done this
Let's give her some cute ponytails, you know, we gotta
We'll do like
Little those cute
All scrunchy things
And then she'll just have a little melty ponytails, okay, I guess I'm just drawing a cute and funny bimbo slime
I'm kind of feeling her though
She's you know
She's doing the most she can
I
Drop drop a little okay, I got you
She's like kind of she doesn't have a brain this is her brain it's very smooth
Enough
Let's give her a cute little like she she tries to pin her hair up, but she can't
That just looks fucking weird actually never mind
We'll give her a
We'll we'll work on the accessories we'll work on the accessories later
I'm doing a new layer for the face
Because I actually like what I have going on right here
So we got we got to do like one giant big fucking eye like what
Oh
Like why did you put me in this jar on each hand?
You're liking big braided bangs and long braided hair in the back
You think I can draw a braid
She has hair sleep shaped slime that's what she's just made of slime, you know
Damn what the fuck
Okay, I'm liking this I'm liking it I think I don't know we'll keep going and find out
Oh
She kind of has a like a like a pissed off girl expression
She's a she's a distant relative of straw knee, but she's like a like a slug like a sea slug made of slime
She's like I really don't want to be here, bro. Like why did you take me to this weird ass mall?
Let's give her freckles
Now she's just emmy never mind
She's just emmy covered in a jar, you know
Ink v type of slime
Ooh good point good point
She's a slime girl audio cooking what I didn't know that
Again I can't draw eyes so they just pissed me off
Oh actually let me just erase like a normal human being
You know what actually
Obviously she has to have her tongue out, you know and then a little bit of
A little bit of wool there, you know
I
Thank you
Let's see I like I like the big eyes
Actually like
What are the what are these eyelashes doing is the question, you know like what's what's going on here?
I
Erase the eye start over
I've seen you draw solid eyes like three times you're good. No, I'm not nothing's good here
Although actually the way that was kind of looks like would be a cute pin area
And then I could just be like this type of eye
Might need to know erase her challenge is that a thing because I would not survive
Thank you for the super
I kind of want her to have like a oh you disgust me look on her face
Bro see notice how I do like 50 different eye styles when I'm drawing something
You
That's when we go back to soul eater
You can't go wrong with soul eater eyes
Brock eyes from focus on
You can't go wrong with them. They're just they're just they're just lovely, you know
Oh, I don't like the color in the
I
But I also I don't like it
But I don't like how it looks
No, let's just erase let's just start over. Oh fuck
Oh
Let's go back to that later. Uh, anyways new layer

Apportions never heard of them
And then hips she's like thick, you know, she's a thickums
What is this abomination that she be is drawing on stream, uh

Thank you
Oh
Please if you're a vtuber looking for amazing rigor art, please reach out to nars. She's
That would not be who I am today
The hips should be bigger
She's pink you can give her a hair accessory that's a clove feather. That's actually really cute
I actually like that
She's like a ink
Character
I don't know proportions
Should I make her o-fi
I'm just I just want to draw boobs, but then I'm fighting against it
Nari appreciation. Oh, it's nari love
Nari's working on my tan twuggle. I'm so excited. I could be brown
Um
I kind of want to give her like
I like to give her really long hair
Give her like really longer
Yeah
I can't believe this would be this is making me wish I was drawing on an iPad again
You see the editing the ears what you're getting there. Oh, yeah, that's right for some like not human ears because I was talking earlier about um
I don't like double ears on a camomomimi. I can't pronounce the word like just animal people
Maybe imagine slam girl thug shape what I don't know what that means
Oh
Okay, she's so she's got big
Slimy hair
She looks like she's kind of made out of water at this point. Um
I think I need to I need to stretch out her body a little bit
I
Don't know what outfit together
What would a bimbo slime girl wear
What
What what's what's this is like I like uh, for example, um
Slimes were close nothing
I can't draw her naked. Um
What's it called? Uh
It is helping me conceptualize like an outfit
For like a future 2.0. This is very distant in the future, but I just love designing things and emi does too
So we're just like kind of collabing on that because I like watching her um do her stream
um
Like I like have ideas for things, but then it's just hard for me to bring them to life
But like design designing is super fun
Two top something waterproof, okay, I guess I'll just give her like a bathing suit
Wait these these proportions ain't proportioning
She's gonna be oh bye
I can't draw boobies
I always remember someone's like draw them like like a little water bottle the water bottle water balloon
High like swimsuit fey watch style
Classic umbrella rain jacket material. Oh, that would be cute
See like
That's why I wish I was an artist because it was up to me. I'd be like, okay bathing suit the top
Is like this
And this is where her kuchi goes
But then this part is like the plastic ski
Shit from like a like a clear rain jacket
And then have her wear a clear rain jacket
Over this and then give her like really big boots like big rest rain boots
And there you go
But I think that would be cute
But I can't draw plastic
Perfection
But you get but you get what I'm saying though, right like you get where I'm coming from
You get you know what I mean
You know what I mean jelly bean
I'm not finishing an actual drawing by the end of the stream
By the way, I hope you I hope you guys don't think I'm gonna finish a drawing because that's
That's never gonna happen ever. I've never finished a drawing in my entire life that picture of um
Saliva is just sitting on my iPad only ahead
Actually, let me see if I can just show you guys it
Wait, but I posted it on my pl
I don't know if I'm feeling logging into that again though
It's time for a moment
No top boots with the laces tied together around her neck to cover her bro, I just choked on my almond
If she was pet time then yes
It would just be like
How about even fucking work
Somebody said hi leg so we'll do some hi leg
I was literally about to say is in me streaming
Because I want to read her then I realize she's not here
Oh
I'm gonna miss her although I get to still talk to her
I see if you taking her quest no, especially not from grain aims
You can always start changing that never finishing anything you time and feel like it. Yeah, that's a good point
I
These almonds are so good. It's a nice healthy snack. Just almonds. I recommend it
Let's fire that great. No, I just like to pick on people sometimes. I don't really care
Ah
I know it's really to ask what is the girl's ever planning to do squad meet up. I'm broke man
Oh, wait, I was like, why are you gonna pay for us to meet up?

Um, that means a lot to me
I'm um people who do member are just people who want to give an extra bit of love and I appreciate you too immensely
Especially people that give stuff
um
Only the difference oh, okay cool
But yeah, don't I don't want anybody to feel like oh
Sheebie doesn't love me because I'm a green name. I love all of you
Wait, no, I don't love you
Forget it forget what I said anyways. Let's keep drawing. I have to fart
I'm I'm okay
I don't love anybody I only love my cats and that's it. I don't even love myself
Almond's making her too. No, I think it's because I had a bowl of cereal earlier
I've only had a bowl of cereal in almonds today. What the fuck is wrong with me?
I
In fact, I put these almonds away. I feel like it's like not good to have too many almonds
Every time I see your name
What do you mean sheebie you don't look gonna be like that. Oh, is anybody gonna get it? It was gonna win. Oh
Oh got some food to order so we'll all do that later. Don't worry about it
Thank you
Also, um
I miscalculated how much money I had in my bank account
And I thought I had like
enough
to like
Like and I have groceries and stuff too, but like I was like I and I don't feel like make anything
Let me worry about but I had already ordered art from somebody that was like 90 dollars and then I'm like, oh wait
My account is negative two dollars
Mom, would you say that you're still the first person I'd like you membership to
Oh, that's very sweet. Thank you
What's up?
Excuse me girl, man. There's much cereal you eat. You should already go to natural resistance to lack
I actually don't eat cereal that often. I just only got cereal the last time with grocery shopping
Um
Okay, I'm
Another
And um
What was I gonna say?
Um, oh, yeah, because I just saw it. I'm like, oh I haven't had cereal
I'm like, uh, I probably shouldn't get cereal because I don't have any I haven't I shouldn't really be drinking milk
And I'm like, I don't really care. It's easy to do. You're just pour milk in a bowl
So I got it. I got some ohs and some shiriyos and I like to make some together
Um, I also didn't do as much grocery shopping as I wanted to because like I said the supermarket when I went
All their whole like frozen food section was gone. Well, not like gone
it was just like out of order because the
the power was out
and um, because normally I'll get like some like oh I'll get some like
Uh, like salmon frozen that I just usually throw in an air fryer
Um, or I'll get some like chicky tendies or I'll get some like grilled chicken and then I'll like usually get like salad kits. Um
and like other like, uh, like vegetables and stuff
to put together
with the food but all their the whole frozen section was like destroyed so I was just like
Like I got syrup then I got home and I'm like wait, I don't have any I don't have any waffles for this syrup
So it sucked and tolerant to let me yes, I used to not be but then I stopped drinking milk for a long time during covid
For some reason. I don't even know why
and then I just like couldn't drink milk again
Uh, I fell in a rush to joke society somewhere near from barfolk and flooded diamond
Oh, that'd be cool actually
Don't you hear how there's never the right amount of cereal to milk creation? Yeah, I agree with that. That's pretty difficult
um, because I usually like
I'll usually like get enough milk
And I'll think I got enough cereal, but then it looks like I'm overflowing the bowl with too much cereal
and then I like
Get a little bit of cereal out and then I'm like, oh wait, maybe it needs more milk and then yeah, I just
Please no more 12 hour salmon. What do you mean? It was delicious
I totally had forgotten I left it out to defrost in like some water
But it was like it was it was covered. It was fine
And it was sitting in a pot in my
Just you know, yeah, I was aged 12 hours to perfection what sauce with attendees
I have this thing, you know, you need to go to the grocery store and there's always something you accidentally buy too much of
minus condiments
Like I'll be like, oh, I probably need this and then I'm like, wait, I already have like two bottles in my fridge
Don't worry, she should be 56
um
Each salmon sounds so wrong. Hey, you can age a steak. I've had dry aged steak
Um, I don't yeah, I don't know and like you can make like salmon jerky
I have kids don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. Uh bodies change as we get older. Yeah at the ripe age of
56 my totally real age. Um
I'm just my body is just shutting down. I'm probably on the verge of death
Ha ha ha
Wet aged salmon
How does it use to eat shrimp all the time hit 30 and he's allergic that sucks
That sucks. So like I love seafood
I love seafood since I was a kid when I was younger at my mom would get annoyed with me because we go to a restaurant as like a special
Special little treat and I try to order like the shrimp scampi or like a lobster dish at age like seven
Because I just love seafood so much and I still do
um
And if if I was allergic to shellfish, I would probably cry
I would probably just curb it
Uh minecraft myself exactly same
So just give me chills
Man a few streams ago you mentioned emi making you crave jerky. So I ended up getting jerky as well
And I got jerky when I went grocery shopping
Emi's just a trend center. I don't know what to tell you my little cute sister is just so influential
um
On the verge of digging the forbidden hole
I like however coming up with all these analogies for dying
Why the fuck you dying your t-shirts, of course
We're doing tie-dye
Tie-dice. Ooh tie-dye hand cam stream
yo
You can cost so much you right
I'm about to put jerky upon my throat
I'm sorry to go. No, I want more jerky. I bought my own jerky though
Came ending
Well being allergic to shellfish shrimp is tasty worth it. Um the only thing I think I might be allergic to is kiwis
Which is just weird
I don't understand why I would be allergic to kiwis because I'll have a kiwi and I've eaten kiwis like my entire life
But I was telling someone and they're just like
I'm like, oh, I love it how like kiwis are almost like spicy like almost like they're carbonated and like sizzle in your mouth and then someone was just like
That's not supposed to happen when you eat a kiwi and I'm like
Uh, no
I'm like that isn't that like it's like, you know, like it's like almost sour. They're like, no
that's
That's you're allergic and I'm like, oh that sucks and then I just kept eating a kiwi because it's not like it doesn't affect me affect me
um
And then my life ended when I found out I was allergic to rabbits
That was that was actually an actual travesty
Because rabbits are so cute and I almost died while petting one
Because I just if I touched I touched my face after uh spending time with a rabbit
And my throat started to close and that was the only time I felt pure panic
um
As I choke my mouth is tinky anyways
Here's my oh there's a stylus. I'm like, where'd it go?
Okay, let's zoom in. Let's let's go to the next step of this lovely
whoa
thing

I'm just gonna put my camera right at this thing. Perfect. Don't move. No, it's fine.
Why am I trying to get an upskirt shot? No, it doesn't matter.
Your stream. What are you doing in my swamp?
E.B. wants to smell your hair.
Oh, that's a good one.
Wow.
Oh, by the way, so I was gonna, I'll probably mostly look up scripts.
I just realized something about my eyes.
One of my eyes is darker than the other.
What?
Like my light shine. One is white and one is not.
What the fuck? But then it goes normal.
And then it goes dark.
What?
Why does it work?
Why does it get darker? And why does the other one stay bright?
Sorry.
Wait, we're just supposed to focus on my eyes? Yeah, focus on my eyes.
Focus on my eyes.
Focus.

Please.
Okay.
Okay.
That's nice.
What am I doing there?
Okay.

Can't wait for everyone's memberships to vanish this week.
What are you talking about?
They want to be a part of this. Are you kidding me right now?
Wow, you can really see the teeth from the back of my mouth.
Mama, mama, mama.
There is your phone.
Yeah, they're paying double.
If you went into this, then you fucking tripping, boy.
Why the fuck would I nuke the vase?
I was clearing my throat.
See?
When you do voice acting,
and you do a lot of talking for a living,
I gotta clear my throat pretty often.
Delicious.
I have to fart.
Thank God I muted.
Thank God I muted.
That was crazy.
That was crazy, bro.
Oh my God.
If you guys...
If I unmuted that,
Far Bros would be eating so good.
Yes, it did.
What I hate about being a woman is that sometimes
you have to...
Well, you don't have to,
but it just happens.
You clearly can't control it.
Sometimes you too,
and it goes towards the front
and says,
pardon me, excuse me, towards your front bits.
And then,
those like to talk and speak up.
So, she says she needs to confirm.
But it's not a qui.
It's not a bon qui qui.
It's not what that is,
because that's when air comes out of your qui qui, you know?
But it takes a...
You thought that was a myth?
No!
It's just like the way that you sit and the pressure,
it'll just go to the front.
It'll still come out of the back,
it'll go to the front.
It's like wings flapping.
Yeah.
It's literally what it sounds like,
except fart version.
I'm not here for quiffanonic.
You're not?
Oh, that's real too,
because you can just get air up there.
Especially
if you're like hanging out,
playing with your Barbie dolls,
and a Barbie doll is like really big.
Excuse me.
It can push air.
And then it will say in a Barbie voice,
qui!
And then you're like, whoa!
Didn't expect that.
It comes out of the back,
travels across the chair
and flaps the front on the left eye.
And we were about to hear it.
I'm also because I'm sweating.
My apartment's so hot right now.
She's a woman of elegance.
There's a lot of many talents.
I can be very elegant and proper.
I can be so proper and motherly,
and I don't know what you're talking about.
I gotta put on my Patreon voice for this,
because I can't believe that you,
out of all people,
wouldn't think that I am not the most elegant woman
in all of the land.
Bye-bye!
Have a good night,
or day, or evening,
lunch or dinner or whatever.

because i want to do it like onigiri style you guys don't need to see me i'm a vtuber you guys
don't need me see me my body is for special occasions sounds so fun probably the next time
i'll show myself will be like a donathan reward or something we get our hands you get my nice brown
hands um somebody said in the comments i have hand dimples i don't and i like after reading that
comment i was like huh what's a hand dimple what the fuck is a hand i'm like looking at my hands
right now i have like i definitely have like a what's it called
um
it's fucking like what the fuck is it handbrows tweaking i don't even know there's a type of
oh i definitely have like a gangly insist because of my fucked up joints i wish i could
i've slammed a bible on it before and it exploded and it was great and then i
didn't have wrist pain for a while i need to do it again because you have to like go and like have your hand
like whatever like i don't i hate your knuckles hand dimples this is my knuckles um i don't
like scars on my body because i get scarred very easily by doing like i still have a fucking
bruise the bruise left a scar that i had i now have a faint brown mark on where i actually must
have accidentally hit my hand my wrist it is dumb bible thumb for heebie like gang or system he's a blood
actually i have no idea but well yeah i'm wearing red so that makes sense
i'm brown i can say it leave me alone um but hitting them with the word uh yes the word of the lord
makes them go away um but lance uh not even lance you can't even lance you literally have to cut it
out because what it is it's your joint fluid uh decides to go out of your bone or whatever the
fuck your joints and then it makes a little pocket and sometimes you can pop it and your body
will reabsorb it but you have to take out the sack so that it stops growing back um ten
i've actually taken a needle before uh like should i be saying this that sounds fucked up
uh i've taken i'm not i've taken a needle before and um i've drawn out some of the liquid
and it's it's pure clear it literally looks like jelly like clear jelly and it was so weird
but it was great because then it went down because i drew and um my mom was like why did you
do that and i'm like because i i'm a doctor she's like no you're not and i'm like well i
should have been this is strangely intimate sis just like hangs out they're not it's not even
like bait like if you in my handcams you can't see it you you generally you can't see it you can't
see it at all like you can't tell i just know it's there because of the pain and because my uh
rheumatologist says they have one uh yeah i was the weird kid in school actually no
should i even say that because that just sounds making me sound like i'm gonna become like a
mass murderer or something i just like seeing how things work that's how what i'll say
okay but have you ever cut your fingers in the room of a peanut butter jar
bro what i cut my finger on a can i um when i was opening those peaches by the way
i forgot update everybody you know how that can opener was like causing me major fucking issues
um and then i cut my finger during the drunk stream um i don't know that was the
vod was nukes but but the thing is the new one works like a dream so it's not me it was not user
error it was what's it called uh it was the the can opener's error so i yeeted that one to the sun
it's dead i killed it and it's family ended its bloodline um in minecraft and now the new one
is great if you say so hard whatever you guys can't see i'm doing like the dj hand thing
but at least it works for you yeah it was like the thing just would like you be start like turning
the thing for the can opener and it would just fall off like it would just and i'm like i know i'm
popping it in so that it's like in the aluminum and i'm twisting it and i'm just fall off but then
this one it's like butter it cuts the aluminum and i'm like oh my god i'm so excited i just
remembered i have a vacuum waiting for me downstairs i have to get for my mail room oh my god sorry out
of yesterday i got a key wait i got a fart
it needs to work for me yeah it works really well it works nicely
like time

terrible like i don't need to see somebody get decapitated i've seen enough it's fine it's not
fine but you know what i mean um you can send me a link to um a script that's like a sleep aid

i'm capable right now um please keyboard asmr i love the clackety clack don't talk back
clackety clack uh i do have like some scripts like i'm probably gonna read one or two scripts
the scripts are only like like 10 minutes long so i've seen enough takes off glasses
but yeah i can't don't worry it's always that fart bro is me
there's a lot of fart bros there's there's more than i thought it uh it concerns me but it is what it is
get any soy sauce what soy sauce i bought some soy sauce the other day but uh not that i know of
i have not been able to look
be existed we are shamed
soy sauce oh i bro i forget i forget everything you got i have the memory of a goldfish
should have been a goldfish watching the rain you got i'm definitely gonna put on those um rain
sounds again the nice copyright free rain sounds thank god um and i'm gonna do like some guided
meditation or we do some body scans and i want you to start with your toes work up to your knee
let out a deep breath and through the mouth
and out through your nose
like shit like that you know i do copyright rain you'd be surprised
um yes
it's funny uh i'm a very spiritual person so i do i do do i do do a lot of meditation just for
like you know to chill um and i feel like it would be nice just to recenter ourselves our chakras
your chakras no um but you know just relax tap into your inner stall and do some soul work
we're just gonna do good vibes okay good vibes i don't know why i just like almost bit my tongue
wriggle your big toe just like that very good she'd be would be in his odx signs does he know
does he know my whole my past life was rena i was a whole ass priestess
i was doing witchy shit on the daily i was doing tarot card readings that was fun i'll probably do
tarot at some point oh she's an astrology bitch oh oh you don't have to believe in it it's just fun
dang really dropped filtered um i like it because i see it as something of a uh
it's almost like a therapy tool because like let's say you're like what do i need to work on
this week and you pull the king of cups for example uh you're like oh king of cups is in
touch with uh his emotions and then you're like maybe i need to be more mindful about my emotions
this week you don't even have to think of it of like oh go sir fucking talking to me it's just i like
to put it like that that's how i frame it not like spirits from the other world they're speaking to me
although i have done i did do uh the carot caro cards yes the carrot cards i have done like spell
jarwork um that was fun i think there's like a short of me as rena where i talked about how you
can abort a baby with mugwort that was cool um i literally have all like my altars above my desk
and all that shit but you know i don't expect people to like like that stuff you don't have to i just do
as you can i don't talk about it on stream a lot because i don't make it a part of my
personality but i will rub rose quartz on you because you need self-love homeboy i'm kidding
it's fine tarot cards are just fun i have a few decks myself exactly yeah huh
uh i have two tarot cards that's very accurate i've been told my readings are very accurate i used
to do it for my previous viewers they loved it a lot uh they in fact scolded me when i because i
usually you would do it every sunday the day of the lord and when i didn't do it on sunday they were mad
i actually haven't done any of like like actually practice in a very long time like i'll leave out
like an offering like and thanks and stuff um for like progress i've made um it's just like it's just
like the equivalent of like okay you pray to your god or your ancestors or what have you
you know everybody's entitled to their belief system i'm a cancer yeah to society i'm kidding
kind of the moon stone so i can snort it baby girl um shibism yes exactly my dm uses tarot
cards i've heard that people will sometimes use tarot and dnd games and i think that's very clever
charger terry why are you guys randomly telling me your zodiac signs are you what do you want me
to do with that information i don't i'm not like i don't like read your birth chart
vergo over here okay everybody's just shouting out i'm a libra libras are very sensual did you know that
torus gang oh you like money don't you little grubby money for um scorpio i'm such a scorpio girl
it's funny because like half of you are probably lying so i'm like i'm not gonna
find about tarot from cyberpunk oh yeah true i didn't think it's super through super well is that
the sedutarius thing oh sedutarius is are very known to kind of be their fire sign so they're
can be like impulsive and they prefer to like act just like aries actually um instead of like think
they're also like boys on the move so my dad is an aries and my mom is a capricorn
hard-working bitch my mom is lover for that yeah i got a ht that checks but like people
are saying like oh i'm a sedutarius and then they won't identify with any traits of a sedutarius
and that's because there are other things that have to do with your birth chart or whatever
i don't read birth charts i don't have knowledge of that um but apparently you are more than just your
your sun sign bergo is an honest sign i don't mind about it
there also one of my one of my olive is a is overgo she's very ocd but she's not she
doesn't have ocd but she's very like it has to be just like this
Pisces don't be fishy uh the one pisces my my best friend growing up was a pisces
they're very creative types she was she was an artist she loved to draw very much a dreamer
as they are described
yeah tracks for bergo i never lie about being a scorpio because that's the only one i know
i know half the time i don't even remember all the zodiac signs i'm like uh
are you gonna aries
see i'm blinking i just like tarot and um doing my own practice just reflective practice
aquarius is just a water book
but i know like emi will probably oh my god her spellwork scares me i feel
as someone if you look at her alt things that she's done i'm like oh
this is why her fan base is so rabid because uh
uh that she they they they they've been yeah uh
why is my bottom half feel tingly i'm i wonder why i wonder why
or pin i don't know i don't i don't feel bad for the pin pals they know what they signed up for
they're fine i know there's some pin pals in my chat welcome pin pals um i'm so sorry you have
to be without your little sister or uh for some time but you'll be okay you'll survive
ic will pick up the slack if you're need some for some
and uh if you need some uh beat down i am here for you
emi says she doesn't want to go on the plane yeah she's i know she was very she's like i just
want to hang out with everybody but that's not what she sounds like i just want to hang out with
everybody i don't want to leave yeah i'm like i'm like yeah i know i hate family too when you
gotta go do family obligations emi you're back that wasn't even a good voice i haven't heard her
voice since um actually we were on call for quite a long time after our our debut um
um it was really fun i was just hanging out with her in mercy in a call just like just shooting
the shit because i think azura had to like um go do something or she yeah no she was streaming
for her monetization so we were just watching her and i'm like i missed you guys and i see was
asleep because i missed her too so i think we're all gonna hang out in a couple days um i'm very i'm
very thankful that i have like gen mates that i i constantly want to spend time with i'm just like
hey do you guys want to hang out do you guys want to chat like emi um i'm gonna miss you a lot so
please be safe at your point um but yeah it's cool
and then uh me and emi were talking about 2.0 ideas which was fun we love great chemistry i agree like i don't
i like if you put like any two of us or three of us or four or five or all of us like we're all
pretty chill like at first i'm like oh i don't know if i'm gonna be okay with someone but then like
literally um after and this was before debut i'm like oh no like are they gonna like me are we gonna
be cool this is gonna be okay and then like i see was the first person i talked to so me and i see
hung out a lot because we were the first ones um that got signed on and um so we were we were chillin we
were chillin big time and then i can't remember who came in after that but then like like honestly
like i see kind of dissipated all of my worries like i was just like oh is there anything like her
like we're golden um and then we were and then everybody's great and i love them
arctic phone was it was so funny oh my god it was so funny
it was so funny oh my god it was so funny it was so funny oh yeah they're not i don't i don't see
them as co-workers they're my sisters they're my sisters they are my sisters and strani is mommy
honestly though it's funny because people like i've been asked by like other people from other
corpos or like um my indie friends and they're like oh what's it like with your boss being your
gen mate i'm like to be honest with you she doesn't really feel like my boss she's just my friend um
and she kind of still falls under that sister category i don't really see her as a boss and
that's what she wants but like obviously obviously i still respect her when she's like hey guys
we need to work on this or do you mind uh doing this uh or like here's some critique for your
or like here's some critique for your last audio like um i will respect and respond
to her but i'll do that for everyone as well um but it's it's it's it's nice because like i don't
feel like well that's not it sounds bad when i say it aloud like i don't feel like i have a boss
but like i do obviously but it's like like it's just a nice work environment you know sisters
benefits indeed your anime girl we're kind of like you not you guys i'm at the other i'm at the
other my gen mates i don't care what you guys think you kidding me right meow i guess strani is more
of a leader for lack of better terms but to be honest i would not we're all on pretty level
ground because like strani will come to me and be like hey what do you think about this and i'm
like oh he's my opinion and i'm like oh you should ask the other girls she's like you know what i will
because like uh you guys forget strani has been a vtuber less for the majority of us so sometimes
she'll ask us questions which is honestly and the thing like what a boss should do is like when they
don't know something be able to talk to their staff and be like hey uh i need your help with this and
she's asked me that um and i know she's probably done that for the other girls too like i know she's
probably because emi has some rigging stuff so she's probably um we were having issues at one point
but it was it wasn't at any fault of our rigor it was literally just um us not knowing how to set up
stuff in vtuber studio properly um we were all struggling to like fix our mouth tracking uh for
some reason because like the sensitivity was like low or whatever but it was just it was just like
vtuber studio being stupid and emi was like oh this this is that and then strani was like yay
so um but yeah these aren't supposed to be all no yeah like leader a leader is someone who knows
when to ask for help um knows what everybody's strengths and weaknesses are and make sure everybody
is supported um but yeah actually then yes strani is a great leader 100 but she doesn't
she's not like i'm what i'm what i mean to say she doesn't come off like i am a top
sorry i'm the top bitch in this this corpo i can't i can't even do with a the accent
but i need a toot
um upwards management collaboration yeah it's just it's just collaboration
guys don't deserve the two you got one free two you don't get anymore
listen first and act second yeah exactly because like strani's been on me she's like oh you
know what should we work on for july and i'm like um i don't know you tell me
but she's but she's like she asked for feedback and she's so receptive because she wants to make
sure everybody's doing okay he's very good he's not mean about anything um i appreciate her a lot
because i like i'm that's why i'm like i don't think i could see myself another company if they
didn't treat me like this like if if like five years from now i'm still a vtuber but violer has
ceased operations god forbid and i get picked up by another corpo if they ain't like strani then
i don't want it i wait the day she be masters of strani impersonation that would be terrifying
uh if only i could be like elizabeth row's blood flame and just literally mimic
people's voices perfectly oh i wish i had that superpower
yeah i definitely won't find a corpo like this um but like i in terms of management yes we're
different in terms of like transparency with like our split and stuff yes we're different
but honestly from like we're not different from other corpos that much minus the patreon
audios i'll be honest with you like yeah but if you're elizabeth you'll be british
i like british accents but i see the i see the quandary there yeah her her kiara impression
and her mori impression were really good but speaking of why do people think do people really
think i sound like mori like i don't i don't think i sound like mori but that's that's very good uh
that's a very good honor collab with mori rap rapping with mori just kidding hollow live fans would
actually murder me they're like whore kill her burn her at the stake i don't think you do oh i think
maybe it was in my debut because some people uh said that i sound like mori and like left comments
about it moro vibe i got a more i got the mori vibe the mori calliope vibe that's an honor thank you
i think it's a transparency that gives perception of you are being vividly wildly different yeah
you know like a lot of people um still like shit honest and stuff because apparently um so people
it was brought to my attention by one of my gen mates that my me quitting my job had made its
way to reddit and reddit people were not happy that i quit my job to be a vtuber that she's like
she's never gonna make it asmr is going down the drain blah blah blah blah and i i shout out to the
like two people in the fed we're like she was already planning on doing this she's getting a
different part-time job and her other job is scoring her over there's more to this than just
she's quitting her job wait for real yeah oh yeah yeah but i was just like
i realized in like normal like normie places like a lot of people really think that we're
gonna be like so shitty or like we're gonna be doing terrible things in our streams and just
makes me laugh so hard because we are the most normal people like yes i'll make some like off-color
jokes and i'll make like make some like preferred jokes but you'll see there's some vtubers that get
away with way more than i do like to be honest even the garthik phone stream 100 i bet like if if we
wanted to we could definitely like tamper ourselves a little bit to be like another corpo like like
like look at idle like we're we're just similar except not cony we see the quiet part out loud that's
literally what i say i'm like we just actually advertise our stuff we're also yeah we have a
relay back i agree mrs boris don't put by much contact yeah that's true
low key when i go back to school and i graduate want to do what you did and quit my job and
fucking ball that's fucking ball um good luck with that bro i i really hope that works out for
you quitting your jobs hard like um i have been looking uh the job stuff sucks like i said i had
savings but hopefully hopefully you know um hopefully that i can just live off a dealer
we'll see because again that's up up to you guys and i don't want to pressure you to be like
i need to live give me your money that you need to live
well like just like you're all yourselves yeah exactly and then you know sometimes we'll
lean into our cafe and like do the fantasy that everybody wants but you know i'm just chilling
i'm just hanging out you know i'm just here i'm just having a good time yeah i don't need food
the move um i kind of want to take a breath okay the bad wording but i understand where you're
coming from but i see has a dedicated more than happy health oh yeah i see his fan base is great
they're very very um like i kind of like looking at everybody's fan bases and like like i'll creep
on everybody's fan bases and be like oh what's what people say
every time i mention don't give me money people just give me money it is the funniest thing guys
stop it um thank you for the for the 420 blaze it
um but yes so like like i i walked back my thing about being like i don't like people
watching other people or oh she marks because i'm just like you know i'm trying to make a
connection i'm trying to network and all that stuff um uh and so i'll creep on you guys and i'm like
oh you guys are sweet oh you guys are nice um i especially like there's a certain type of love
and affection that everybody's fan base has for them for their respective talents and it just
generally makes me so happy to see you know there's always like a couple of ones that are like
when's your period did you wake up but like that's that's that's in every every fan base
um i am always watching
and my my fan base i realize i think they control themselves they're like they hold back
and i think that's sweet i feel like they're i feel like thank you black silence
i heard money superserved thank you
oh yeah no again i recognize a lot of people and i'll i'll creep on you a different stream
oh my god anonymous tip six dollars and ninety cents what's the cut out only heard give me money
okay yeah people are gonna think i'm a fandom um thank you anonymous for that tip uh yeah i hold
back yeah it's it's it's so interesting how the dynamics um and i'm like maybe it's because like
i'm a little reserved as well like i don't maybe i don't do as much um and also just how my how i am
i'm i'm very
there's a lot of trust that has to be built you know um so i know like i'm slowly opening up
like yes i've done like fun things now and then on my all but like i haven't shown my true power level
um but ew brother ew fandom ew um fans reflect the streamer so i'm like okay i fans reflect the streamer
is it because i'm reserved but i what i was gonna say i'm like i feel like i'm like the girl at school
that you think is really pretty and cute and you just don't know how to talk to her
and you're like i want you to step on me i just i really want to tell her that
anonymous tipped four dollars and 20 cents so i heard supers and tips are free oh my god thank you
um yeah it's only been three weeks it's crazy and yeah and it's like we'll grow like i i'm probably
going to be you know a different streamer in the future because i'm going to be learning more things
i'm gonna kind of become uncomfortable with each other um but not even just like i i know i don't
have as have as much as a ravenous fan base or rabid fan base as uh some of the other girls
um and honestly like that's okay because i think we're all unique we all attract a different
group of people i love the sweet devotion of reeflings i love the absolute care that dadas have for
i see i love the worshiping aura that bleeding hearts that the blacks have the black bros have
for for azura i love the respectful admiration of senpai's um i appreciate the insanity that our pen pals
um and then you know i love my harem i don't love you no i didn't say that shut up uh i appreciate
my hair um and it's funny because i also i will admit i vote it's i love my daughter wife i see
you uh i will admit because of the character i play i do hold back and i've been told um by someone
that uh i hold back i'm a freak baby i'm a freak um but it's also like a lot of the things uh
uh that i would go off about don't really apply to this persona like it kind of made more sense when i
was rena she was cute and funny but for being dominant and in control uh but even then like
there's some things i'm just like no i can't say that i can't i don't i can't i can't uh
uh encourage that type of behavior because i have to be responsible i'm responsible
for the sometimes i'm just like go crazy go stupid uh wait you aren't here but hold on
um
just kidding bitch um that big mama um anyway
reserved for the cute and funny 2.0 maybe
i don't know just holding back a lot of you guys were very surprised by the present that i got you
you thought i want to treat you that's uh that's the reason why i didn't put it on
my throne is that like i'm going to buy this for them
he scratches all the itches what's the cage what are you talking about that's that's what i do pilates with
um
i have a lot of bunnies in my room oh i just noticed i have those cool cloud
lights that's actually kind of cool anyways
i felt treated still hurting a bit oh i'm so sorry
yeah like i i put the bed together it's really nice wait what the f**k is it oh
there's some s**t in my room i just don't notice
um but yeah i put the bed together yesterday it looks real nice no you can't get out of the
counteract you signed it in blood you're bound to me forever more you think you can escape
you cannot escape my last

it's not gonna wonder when
bed makes that too feral yeah i'm i'm probably gonna maybe next week i'll do the hand cam

build a bionicle on stream yeah be a big btuber if i build a bionicle
i haven't watched bionicle in a very long time i was supposed to i was really bummed because
i hate when like sh** gets in the way like real life gets in the way one of my uh
pl friends um she's very sweet she's like she likes to play a lot of retro games her name is ria
uh we were supposed to have a bionicle watch along together that we never

you should that guy from dexter as a guest on your stream and have him use your what
you b*****l no okay anybody nobody's making sense are you all drunk you guys typing with one hand
i can get you to type with one hand
yeah i don't know how you can do anything to this sort of stream but go off
i'm a little
hey can i go cross-eyed
i don't think i can
your hands are drawing oh is that what they call it i hope you guys are drawing very hard
you know i need some ideas on like how to be
more discreet because i have been told that i'm not
you know what i'm f*****g talking about relax
you guys were discreet in one way really bro
really
okay i'm calling it that from now on you guys better be reading your bible i hope you're reading
your bible i hope uh whatever hand you like to turn the pages with i hope you're reading your
bible really study your verses i want you to really focus on that scripture that you're reading
right now the very top of the scripture that i want you to slowly read the scripture down
and then i want you to repeat the process for other scriptures linger
at the beginning of the words in the scripture and then slowly
read the final words really meditate on the word okay you love bible study oh i love bible study i
bible study i did up my bible study before
what was that
jesus took the strap verses we know i don't um yeah i was reading i was watching
it's really meditating on scripture it took longer for me to finish the passage than i
anticipated none outfit when
goth none hi reina
i burp on you reina
why is your chest wet were you just drinking water and just stuck your body in it
five minute bible study yeah usually it's i do a quick bible study um but that one was like a
20 minute bible study i don't it was really hard my favorite verse um
if your eye is harming you tear it from your head and cast it away
and if you have a rafter in your own eye do not point out the rafter in your brother's
for you must remove your own raptor yourself
yeah and that's actual scripture um by the way
and the name of the bible writer of the holy spirit amen
ah yes luke 623 is that luke 623
proverb maybe i think it is a proverb i can't remember remember the bible it was so long
you got something in your eye what the what it means i don't get my eye till i
what it means is you can't point out bad shit the other people have done when you have done
your own bad shit you got to work on yourself before you could be like oh you did this shit
i think reina did she tear up the eyes of your no no no it wasn't tear the eye of your enemy
well again there's different translations because you have like the king's james translation you have like
i can only think of the king's james one right now
but yes uh very much i hope you're meditating on your scripture um i should put a non-outfit on throne
people ask like oh how do i count oh no my question is how do i how am i supposed to count
down through certain scriptures like that's what i'm wondering about
how do i do that like oh okay first verse second verse third verse
be a fan of the older new testament i'm an old testament i like uh i like old testament god
because he was just like a dick and wanted to kill everybody you know my favorite conspiracy
theory about the bible is that they're two separate gods because the old testament god and the new
testament god are very very different in how they act towards humans all testament gods like i'm
gonna smite everyone and the new testament god's like oh i love you all oh you're so sweet here's my
son i'm sending my son he's gonna die for your son uh i just like how badass old testament god was
although book of revelation is trippy as hell i'll tell you that much
let's say start at 10 first 10 and go backwards oh i like that i like that
i want you to read luke chapter six verse 10 and then i want you to read
luke chapter six verse nine
and then i really want you to think about eight
are you thinking hard about eight
uh we'll finish the other chapter the other verse is another day though you know
bible study stream went soon
i think so hard right now good good really really meditate on the word
drink your wine and eat the cracker take the eukaryst open your mouth take the eukaryst take it right
now wider open your mouth chew swallow good boy can't wait for verse seven you're gonna have to
wait for verse seven i didn't say you could finish the rest never got around to reading the bible
too many people said i would tell me i was about to read the
oh man
you do you go fuck with the what the the bible says
as long as you ain't hurt nobody you good
no spoilers freeze this is a formal wait yep formal wait we will we will read verse seven another day
this reviewer is gonna turn to a cult it's so funny i'm my pl i called um again i was a priestess
and i had a cult and my cult were called worship purrs so i'm very knowledgeable about running
cults that's why i love called the lamb really appeals to me so we old or new testament we old testament
i'm destroying i'm destroying you like sadham and gamora
