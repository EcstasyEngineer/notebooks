The microphone I fixed it. I fixed it

03:12.300 --> 03:13.860
Hello

I literally just spilled water on myself, and I'm not even like joking and like trying to be cheeky or whatever

03:20.140 --> 03:23.620
I literally I just noticed I didn't close

03:24.220 --> 03:29.460

Work so hard to fix this and you're telling me

04:05.780 --> 04:10.860
Oh no, oh my god

04:18.340 --> 04:22.340
Okay, I think there was like a filter on and I don't know why it did that

04:27.460 --> 04:29.460
No, there's no AC shoes

04:32.980 --> 04:36.380
Wait, no, you can hear I literally I was

04:37.140 --> 04:39.140
Messing around for an hour

04:39.740 --> 04:46.460
With my microphone trying to fix it. So if you're telling me you can still hear my AC. I'm gonna cry

04:46.780 --> 04:48.780
I'm literally

04:49.100 --> 04:51.100
Where's my crying tag?

04:55.060 --> 04:57.060
Gonna cry

04:57.300 --> 04:59.300
AC is the main care. No

05:00.140 --> 05:04.380
No, hold on. I don't believe you. Are you guys lying to me? I'm gonna listen to myself for a second

05:09.460 --> 05:11.580

Oh

05:41.100 --> 05:46.460
Shit fuck where I messed something up. No, that's not what I meant to do

05:47.860 --> 05:49.860
There it is I

05:50.700 --> 05:56.100
Need to change the toggle for this because it makes my whole entire YouTube full screen

05:56.100 --> 05:58.100
Oh

06:03.300 --> 06:05.300
Sounds perfect

06:05.340 --> 06:07.340
It's still there

06:09.100 --> 06:11.100
Okay, no, you know what we're serious

06:11.820 --> 06:13.820
you guys

06:13.860 --> 06:21.700
Don't forget just because I'm a goofy girl failure as some of you like to affectionately call me doesn't mean I

06:22.980 --> 06:25.340
Won't wrap my legs around your head

06:26.100 --> 06:31.180
And squeeze you tightly until your neck pops like a Barbie doll

06:34.980 --> 06:39.220
Hmm, I promise it's not a no. Yeah, it's not a threat. It's a promise

06:44.380 --> 06:51.900
Have any in at all today it's 4 p.m. You know, we're just I'm gonna have a little bit of girl dinner a little bit of early girl dinner

06:52.740 --> 06:54.740
Um

06:56.340 --> 06:58.340
So mom

06:58.500 --> 07:00.740
Go-go squeeze apple cinnamon applesauce

07:02.900 --> 07:04.900
Don't eat a cookie. I know

07:05.540 --> 07:07.540
Can you believe Azura's?

07:08.460 --> 07:13.380
ASMR got taken down when she was way more in tamer than me or

07:15.100 --> 07:19.860
Or in me and honestly, I feel like she was just as tame as Mercy and Mercy's is still up

07:19.860 --> 07:23.100
Thank God. Mine's gone to the ether aka. It's been privated

07:23.940 --> 07:27.980
I'm like tempted to like let's put on private it for like a minute

07:30.020 --> 07:32.020
Oh

07:32.740 --> 07:34.740
Mmm

07:34.740 --> 07:36.740
Yeah, I'm actually the only one that made it out alive

07:37.260 --> 07:39.740
That's because I can't help myself and tease you guys. I

07:40.660 --> 07:43.700
Also, just like I personally really like

07:44.260 --> 07:46.260
mouth sounds

07:46.460 --> 07:48.560
And it is just really annoying

07:50.020 --> 07:54.940
But I'm like I can't even do like mouth sounds or kisses or belated numb numb numb numb

07:55.660 --> 07:59.660
It's trying to you nice. I'm are they I don't know. I haven't looked at her schedules. I

08:00.980 --> 08:04.900
Haven't looked at her. We have a little schedule thing. I have to I haven't looked at it. I

08:06.020 --> 08:08.180
Know that strong. He's playing like avatar

08:08.820 --> 08:13.980
At first when I started on the schedule, I'm like, oh like the last airbender, but no James

08:14.140 --> 08:16.140
I

08:18.940 --> 08:22.980
But yeah, I can't on private the vaude because I will get got

08:23.700 --> 08:26.060
because in me got got and

08:27.580 --> 08:29.180
Azura got got

08:29.180 --> 08:32.140
Honestly, it's only a matter of time before Mercy gets got

08:33.060 --> 08:35.060
So it is what it is

08:36.020 --> 08:41.220
But you know, um, I know that some people are trying to find a way to put together

08:42.020 --> 08:46.260
Like some sort of archiving system if that does happen, I will

08:48.100 --> 08:53.700
Definitely pass that along to you guys or whatever if that's allowed. I don't know manager

08:56.460 --> 09:05.580
Will you do I'm not safe for work non-live on your channel. Well, this is is it's not safe for work. I know I'm like

09:06.460 --> 09:13.340
Big boob duh, but like I'm I'm safe for work. Oh, do you mean like a video video?

09:13.340 --> 09:20.300
Um, I do have like although I know strong. He's worried that I might get taken down or something

09:20.300 --> 09:22.300
Um, I have like a really cute

09:22.860 --> 09:27.380
like snuggle with me audio and then like a meme audio and

09:28.140 --> 09:31.780
So I don't but I don't know if it'll work

09:32.100 --> 09:36.940
Like I don't know if like because YouTube's really cracking down on any sort of mouth sounds

09:37.660 --> 09:43.420
And how the algorithm works an algorithm just the bots work right now is that they're combing through the newest videos

09:43.420 --> 09:47.900
So that's why you'll like see like people with like millions of views

09:49.460 --> 09:51.460
Have like the most foul

09:52.380 --> 09:57.180
ASMR videos, but they're like from like a year ago or so or like a couple months ago

09:58.180 --> 10:04.260
The it's not you it the bots aren't prioritizing the old ones are prioritizing the new stuff. So

10:04.900 --> 10:07.180
Yeah, oh, I just smack my microphone. Sorry

10:07.940 --> 10:11.620
Because I'm gesturing. I need a 3d model so bad. I'm moving around

10:12.100 --> 10:20.300
Um, but yeah in the JP side. Yes, the JP side has been and I also think that's because the bots don't really know how to

10:21.300 --> 10:26.820
Deal with England deal with English the bull they don't but like handle like Japanese and stuff

10:27.220 --> 10:29.380
It's the Mackis again by big girl. Oh

10:30.860 --> 10:32.860
You're so bad

10:37.020 --> 10:40.300
But um, yeah, so that's why we're getting kind of like

10:41.300 --> 10:46.660
Tart and also like people are gonna report us because you know, we're a company that

10:47.740 --> 10:52.980
Although we do safer work on our YouTube channels. They will you know report us. It is what it is

10:53.220 --> 10:55.220
We knew what we were getting into. Oh

10:56.220 --> 10:58.380
That she be calm bum

10:58.380 --> 11:00.220
Pots need to let go

11:00.220 --> 11:04.580
Like I looked up here looking videos and some of them are not yet up and not taken down like the bigger youtuber

11:04.580 --> 11:11.020
Yeah, exactly and it's like another thing like people like oh my god, you guys are getting cold so bad

11:11.100 --> 11:16.820
It's because we're very new that the bots look at our channel and they're like, okay

11:17.180 --> 11:19.180
They don't watch a lot of videos

11:19.660 --> 11:25.620
They don't comment too too much they must be a bot so we're gonna remove some followers

11:25.620 --> 11:27.860
We're gonna and that's what so they've just kind of been

11:28.940 --> 11:33.060
Nuking our stuff and like we probably be over 5k by now

11:33.580 --> 11:35.580
But I feel like when we get monetization

11:36.500 --> 11:40.060
Which is a very phone. We haven't like

11:40.780 --> 11:43.540
Applied it yet. We're just making sure everything's good before then

11:45.300 --> 11:47.300
but when

11:48.300 --> 11:51.260
See I lose my train of thought cuz I'm I'm just a little

11:53.100 --> 11:58.580
But when yeah, so it's just because of the algorithm the bots whatever it's I don't really think

11:59.060 --> 12:05.300
Somebody is like at YouTube sitting at their desk and every time we get a hundred new followers taking away

12:07.700 --> 12:09.700
And I also I don't think YouTube

12:10.340 --> 12:12.180
Much likes

12:12.180 --> 12:17.020
VTubers like twitch as well. So y'all y'all y'all she got that chibits is

12:19.380 --> 12:26.860
Would you believe me if I told you I have not been diagnosed with autism or ADHD, I'm just a quirky gal

12:31.340 --> 12:40.420
John YouTube hates youtubers. Yeah, and if um and I can't add any free stuff to my patreon because if it's 18 plus overall

12:42.180 --> 12:44.180
It can't be

12:44.620 --> 12:48.060
It has to be pay walled like 18 plus stuff has to be pay walled

12:50.860 --> 12:55.040
See and I'm probably gonna try to figure out how to upload like

12:55.820 --> 12:57.820
Maybe I'll do like a Twitter

12:58.100 --> 13:03.580
I'll ask management if I can make like a Twitter that I can upload the VODs to like um

13:04.460 --> 13:08.820
Cut it in half because I know you can upload like two hours. I think to Twitter

13:09.020 --> 13:11.020
So I'm like just in case

13:11.060 --> 13:12.860
Like archive it

13:12.860 --> 13:16.940
Maybe I don't know if it's not sure. I don't know anything about YouTube. I don't I'm sorry

13:18.020 --> 13:23.180
It's only my my six day my six day out here. I don't know what I'm doing

13:24.660 --> 13:26.420
But um

13:26.420 --> 13:31.100
Yeah, fans late, maybe I don't know cuz I don't I don't know how fancy it works either

13:31.660 --> 13:37.380
But yeah, I bet like where I know what we're looking to get more established on other platforms

13:37.380 --> 13:43.180
There are more used and then we'll like I know like a hundred percent at one point want to play like the

13:43.940 --> 13:45.940
Hoony pop like with the

13:46.020 --> 13:48.380
with the you know with the

13:51.580 --> 13:58.180
Yeah, but yeah, who knows have a burner va channel, but that'd be like but that's a thing like if I made a burner va channel

13:58.260 --> 14:04.140
It'll probably just get taken down, especially. Yeah, I just don't I feel like this wouldn't work

14:06.620 --> 14:12.580
I will not touch Twitter even if you pay me unfortunately, but my archival is good archival. Okay

14:13.620 --> 14:18.740
This guy hates Twitter. He hates zitter. What's who?

14:22.780 --> 14:25.140
He doesn't know and he doesn't know whatever

14:26.020 --> 14:29.900
The joke over his head. Um, but yeah, we're gonna play

14:31.820 --> 14:33.820
Hold on me eat some applesauce

14:36.900 --> 14:38.900
Wait, no mouth down

14:41.620 --> 14:45.620
We have to play we have to play we're going to play

14:48.180 --> 14:54.340
Class of 09 I've never played it before I've only watched the trailer in the animated thing which I thought was hilarious

14:54.340 --> 14:56.340
I was laughing hysterically. Um

14:57.060 --> 15:03.340
If you're someone who I'm just gonna say a little disclaimer if you're someone who is sensitive to like

15:04.020 --> 15:09.020
Darker humor and edgy humor and jokes. This might not be the video for you

15:10.100 --> 15:14.180
because um, if you ever saw the anime trailer, there are some

15:16.780 --> 15:19.540
What's that song pumped up kicks jokes

15:20.580 --> 15:23.860
If you catch my drift, maybe pin a disclaimer, that's a good idea

15:24.340 --> 15:26.340
Mm-hmm

15:28.900 --> 15:30.900
Let me just tippy-tappy type

15:36.100 --> 15:38.580
Video game is edgy

15:40.100 --> 15:44.580
If you don't like it go cry elsewhere

15:46.260 --> 15:48.260
Okay, thanks

15:48.500 --> 15:50.500
Also check out my merch

15:54.740 --> 15:57.780

16:11.940 --> 16:13.940
Okay, I need a link

16:15.620 --> 16:17.620
My stomach hurt I wonder why

16:19.460 --> 16:22.820
Probably because I need to eat something I'm like

16:23.700 --> 16:29.220
Craven cheeky tendies in the worst way. I saw our meme about cheeky tendies and I'm like

16:30.580 --> 16:32.580
Oh, I need me some cheeky tendies

16:33.620 --> 16:35.620
Okay, where is my

16:43.460 --> 16:49.140
Hell yeah, brother, I don't even know how to pin something so this will be we'll see how this works

16:49.860 --> 16:51.860
Nobody talk

16:53.780 --> 16:56.420
Okay, I did it because then I wouldn't be able to catch up to it

16:59.620 --> 17:04.020
Oh shit, where did my not no not the viewer count

17:06.420 --> 17:07.860
Oh

17:07.860 --> 17:10.900
Oh, okay. So yeah, you guys voted that you guys want me to do the voices

17:10.900 --> 17:15.780
So I'll do the voices we'll have a girl that kind of looks like me. She's very cute. She's blonde there

17:15.860 --> 17:17.860
We actually have the same exact eye color

17:18.820 --> 17:21.300
You know what I should have done. I should have like prepared

17:22.020 --> 17:24.180
Something where I'm like I cosplay as her

17:24.820 --> 17:29.140
It would have taken way too long to cut off my head from my body again though. That took me like an hour

17:30.020 --> 17:32.180
I have to make my full model transparent for that

17:33.620 --> 17:35.620
Um, she looks like she might be like

17:36.180 --> 17:41.700
Valley girl and the other girl who is like dark hair and blue eyes looks like she might be like, oh my god

17:41.860 --> 17:44.740
I fucking hate it here. So she's probably be closer to my normal voice

17:48.260 --> 17:50.260
Nicole jacka

17:51.940 --> 17:53.940
Jacka and Nicole

17:54.980 --> 17:58.820
It's not it wasn't a technical difficulty how it works to use those little things

17:59.460 --> 18:01.060
Except I did it wrong

18:01.060 --> 18:05.620
Because I can't read Japanese or Chinese. Okay. Ni ha ma leave me alone. Um

18:07.140 --> 18:10.420
So I have to you have to make her the whole so from the neck

18:11.300 --> 18:14.260
Down I had to make my entire model transparent

18:14.340 --> 18:18.100

Jumping spiders. I had a little when I went to the store for the drunk stream

25:10.340 --> 25:13.380
There's a massive, uh, I can't remember the latin name of it

25:13.780 --> 25:17.300
It wasn't the the black jumping spider. It's the more brown one

25:17.700 --> 25:22.740
And she was hanging on the side of my car when I was driving over and I'm like and I was tapping on the window

25:22.820 --> 25:26.980
trying to get her attention when I was stationary, of course and um

25:28.180 --> 25:32.020
I'm like ma'am ma'am. Please let me pick you up so I can put you uh

25:33.140 --> 25:38.500
In a tree or like in these bushes or in this grass and she just wouldn't let me she wouldn't let me pick her up

25:38.500 --> 25:41.540
So I'm like, all right. You're coming with me to the store. So she came to the store

25:41.780 --> 25:46.340
And so she probably would never have traveled that far in her life. So I hope I didn't like

25:47.460 --> 25:51.540
Ruin anything for her and there's also this family of jumping spiders that live on the side of my balcony

25:51.940 --> 25:56.660
It's this big lady and her boyfriend that I'm surprised. She hasn't eaten yet or maybe he's just like hasn't

26:17.380 --> 26:19.700
I had my desktop audio turned off

26:21.220 --> 26:22.260
Dang it

26:22.260 --> 26:27.300
Because then it messes stuff up because then it like double plays but the thing

26:28.020 --> 26:32.020
I need to like make it. I don't know how to make it. So it's like a separate sound thing for

26:32.980 --> 26:36.180
Alerts so it doesn't just play my desktop because I say

26:37.060 --> 26:39.060

26:58.260 --> 27:00.900
Like I used to be afraid of bugs and my mom got me this bug book

27:00.980 --> 27:06.420
And I would just walk around with little magnifying glass and that like I was it really helps you conquer your fear

27:07.060 --> 27:13.860
Um guys, I'm I did not graduate in 2009 for the love of god. No, I did not graduate that early

27:14.260 --> 27:18.500

27:25.220 --> 27:27.220

I don't know if I was eight. I just was like, was I eight? I don't know

27:42.980 --> 27:50.340

35:43.260 --> 35:45.260
Apple apple puree concentrate

35:45.700 --> 35:48.380
Lemon juice concentrate cinnamon. Okay, that's actually not bad

35:50.300 --> 35:56.180
You go go go squeeze you go girl you go Glenn cocoa. I also like these cuz they're gluten and dairy free

35:56.180 --> 36:01.140
I really should be fully gluten and dairy free cuz I suffer every every time I have a bowl of cereal

36:01.140 --> 36:06.460
But you know, it's worth it. I really like Cheerios. I had a bullet Cheerios yesterday. It was great

36:34.940 --> 36:37.620
Dairy contribute a lot to inflammation so

36:38.780 --> 36:40.780
Like eating something to do

36:41.620 --> 36:49.340
Frequency if you're 56, are you still breedable? Um, yes, of course hundred percent breedable. Wait, why did I answer that?

36:50.140 --> 36:52.140

36:52.220 --> 36:54.220

38:00.620 --> 38:02.620
Stream not found retrying now

38:03.340 --> 38:10.700
Can I how the frick do I get rid of it stream not found

38:14.460 --> 38:16.460
Stream not found

38:17.660 --> 38:19.660
You guys hear that good

38:22.220 --> 38:27.340
If I just you uh, I see I see

38:27.820 --> 38:34.860
Uh, yeah, I'm gonna probably get a new overlay because there's a little bubble and not being able to see like a part of the screen is really

38:35.260 --> 38:37.260
grinding my gears

38:38.460 --> 38:42.060
Fiat, can you stop attacking me under the blanket?

38:43.340 --> 38:45.340

Wait, it's not letting me oh, whatever. I don't who cares just play the game just play the game gb

39:22.380 --> 39:24.380
Oh shit

39:26.540 --> 39:28.540
The cat

39:29.420 --> 39:35.180
All right, um, let's see scene volume. That's fine. That's fine. That's fine

39:37.820 --> 39:43.500
It's funny when a girl tells her story only to be told back that it's unrealistic

39:45.100 --> 39:47.260
Almost as if they're afraid to believe it's real

39:48.540 --> 39:50.540
He's fucking loud in my ears

39:51.260 --> 39:58.220
For everyone who doesn't know my mom's a bitch my dad shot himself my life sucks and my brother's on a watch list

39:58.620 --> 40:00.620
Ayo

40:11.740 --> 40:16.460
Was that bad it was just really standard other girls saying their gym teacher wanted to bang them

40:16.540 --> 40:18.540
Their counselor texting them at three in the morning

40:18.700 --> 40:23.180
I was the only one with a white nationalist photography teacher though, so I guess that's something but here's the problem

40:23.340 --> 40:27.660
Mom won't listen the principal doesn't care and I still have all of senior year to get through

40:28.140 --> 40:30.940
My life's just a game a sick hopeless game

40:31.580 --> 40:35.180
Like I've never really been I think I skipped the first game

40:37.260 --> 40:41.740
How's it wait what I really hope they can help me through that. What do you mean?

40:43.580 --> 40:45.580
This is a sequel

40:48.860 --> 40:50.860
Fuck

40:59.580 --> 41:06.540
No, I want to play the first one. I thought the re-up was like a redone version. Oh my god, do I have to buy the game?

41:09.740 --> 41:13.820
I gotta log out and then I gotta buy them my other account and then I gotta

41:19.500 --> 41:21.500
I am alive

41:21.820 --> 41:23.820
Same characters different stories

41:24.860 --> 41:27.660
No, it would take it would be fine. Oh my god. I'm it

41:30.140 --> 41:32.140
I hate it here

41:35.900 --> 41:40.620
Okay, do you want me to go get the first game?

41:41.020 --> 41:45.660
Or do you just want me to play this game?

41:47.500 --> 41:49.500
I will

41:49.500 --> 41:53.260
Because I do want to play the first game. Okay. I'm gonna hold on

41:58.700 --> 42:02.780
I am the world's worst streamer. I really

42:02.940 --> 42:13.420
Okay, I'm gonna be ventriloquist for just a split second

42:17.820 --> 42:20.780
How could this happen to me?

42:23.820 --> 42:25.820
Scuff cotton bum

42:25.980 --> 42:29.260
No, no, no, no, I I thought I would have gotten the first one

42:29.340 --> 42:31.900
I'm gonna play the first one because I wanted to play the first one

42:32.300 --> 42:38.380
I thought it was the first one just like read. I thought the re-up was just like like they remastered it because I'm weird

42:45.420 --> 42:52.300
Look back at this laugh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, why am I big? I'm trying to just scroll

42:52.300 --> 42:59.580

43:28.780 --> 43:33.020
So, uh, how about them Dodgers?

43:40.700 --> 43:44.540

43:49.820 --> 43:51.820
How's that sports ball?

43:58.380 --> 44:04.140

Oh, they don't so it is automatic. Okay. You know what? We're just gonna. I'm not voice acting. We're saving my voice

48:04.140 --> 48:10.380
Oh, that's your motive for keeping me alive. Yeah, sure. No problem. So will I see you in science today about that?

48:10.940 --> 48:12.140
Why don't you start me something else?

48:12.140 --> 48:15.340
So will I see you in science today about that?

48:15.340 --> 48:17.340

Regardless of whatever you say. I'm not showing up to any class with jeffrey for the rest of the week

48:21.820 --> 48:26.860
I exerted all that energy to keep you alive and you're still not to go. You can come with me if you want

48:27.420 --> 48:33.100
Uh, I'm just balling the crap out of me after I graduate fine. Go to science and let jeffrey do elmo voice at you

Oh god, are you even going? Yeah, the video is great. The game's quiet. Okay. Yep. All right

48:42.220 --> 48:44.220
Let's go to the mall

48:47.100 --> 48:49.500
Why did we come here if we don't even know what we want to buy

48:49.900 --> 48:54.300
Dude, we're literally in the mall. Just figure it out. Even if I do want something. It's just torture

48:54.380 --> 48:58.620
I have like no money. Who said we're buying anything. Just steal the shit. Oh, okay

48:59.020 --> 49:01.340
You think they have MSI stuff here. I'm sorry I mentioned

49:01.740 --> 49:03.740
Yeah, they're all in my shuffle and they might be in town

49:05.100 --> 49:07.100
I love it. She's me

49:07.820 --> 49:11.100
No, I'm just surprised you like MSI because you're so

49:11.820 --> 49:13.820
Normal

49:14.540 --> 49:15.660
Oh

49:15.660 --> 49:22.780
Never mind. Okay. So what do we get? I want a cd. I'm a self-indulgence great band. Why can't we steal both?

49:23.020 --> 49:27.740
She won't steal twice in the same trip. The only people here is us and some dad buying sketches

49:27.900 --> 49:30.220
Like how they spelt sketches wrong probably on purpose

49:30.780 --> 49:35.900
You wouldn't look at us. We're like children. I know sidekicks are so cool. I used to want one so bad

49:39.260 --> 49:41.260
You know when I was 56

49:43.180 --> 49:45.180
Um

49:45.980 --> 49:50.780
I'm stealing her should I steal a shirt? Oh, I just want to this is so funny. Um

49:52.300 --> 49:55.100
Should I steal a $10 shirt or still a cd?

49:57.740 --> 50:01.260
Where iPods around in 2008 because then I would just pirate it

50:02.380 --> 50:04.380
I'm stealing a shirt

50:07.820 --> 50:09.820
Steal the seat well too bad

50:15.340 --> 50:17.900
You wouldn't download you wouldn't download a car

50:22.540 --> 50:24.540
Sludge lord this looks like

50:25.340 --> 50:27.340
Either Spencers or hot topic

50:28.780 --> 50:29.900
Like

50:29.900 --> 50:33.100
I don't know the tv said you suck. So fuck you. Yeah, right

50:33.260 --> 50:37.900
You guys get paid eight an hour to go to that bitch idiot school. He gets paid eight an hour. Oh, that's true

50:38.780 --> 50:44.860
That would impress us. Yeah, you're dumb white and bro. I applaud five the i4 were out. Okay, bitch

50:45.020 --> 50:48.860
Hey, whoa, where's your manager? Oh wait, I didn't notice it was a hot topic shirt

50:50.300 --> 50:52.300
God damn it fine. Sorry

50:52.300 --> 50:55.500
Good now what sizes do you have msi shirts in right now?

50:56.700 --> 51:02.460
You know the thing is you don't talk to the staff when you go to steal something right because then they're just like they

51:02.700 --> 51:04.540
They know you out is what we have, dude

51:04.700 --> 51:08.860
If you don't check right now, I'm gonna tell your manager. You didn't say hi to us when we walked in

51:09.260 --> 51:13.100
Fuck fine. Joe. Go to your bitches. I'm just gonna go back and pretend to look

51:14.140 --> 51:17.980
Okay, grab the small let's go. Yeah, I was like, how the fuck do you think I'm a large come on

51:19.180 --> 51:21.900
Well, you got big titties. How'd you learn how to do that?

51:22.300 --> 51:26.780
What do you mean learn you can't just take the shit in front of them. Okay, it's like it's like that's just a common sense

51:27.100 --> 51:30.540
Before we get caught. We can't leave now. That was the sound experience. I actually

51:33.180 --> 51:35.180
Cannot comment on that

51:37.500 --> 51:40.540
You know when I was younger, why would you risk getting caught one time?

51:41.580 --> 51:46.220
Oh my god, they talk so fast. I can't even one time. Um

51:47.260 --> 51:49.260
When I was younger

51:49.500 --> 51:51.500
I stole candy

51:51.820 --> 51:53.100
He he

51:53.100 --> 51:56.060
But like one of those like penny candies at like the grocery store

51:57.340 --> 52:01.180
And my dad I was like five and my dad like made me like

52:01.980 --> 52:03.340
Walk back

52:03.340 --> 52:05.340
because he I knew

52:05.820 --> 52:07.980
I took something you probably just saw me do it

52:08.460 --> 52:11.020
And then he's just like and I was like acting really sus

52:11.980 --> 52:16.700
And then my dad made me walk back and apologize to the manager in return the candy

52:16.940 --> 52:18.700
It was literally like

52:18.700 --> 52:22.860
Awerthers like an individually wrapped like werthers and like jolly ranchers

52:23.340 --> 52:27.020
1970 yeah 1975 that's why I call it penny candy. Exactly

52:27.820 --> 52:30.060
So, yeah, it was he stole tic-tacs

52:31.260 --> 52:34.620
Oh my god tic-tacs or tic-tacs still around. I don't even know

52:35.500 --> 52:39.260
Or with the free samples lady chase after us literally anywhere, but here come on

52:39.980 --> 52:41.980
Oh

52:42.780 --> 52:44.780
Little diner

52:45.820 --> 52:50.540
This suspiciously looks like a diner. I know

52:54.780 --> 52:59.980
Where does this take place it's literally just a burger or maybe every all diners just look the same I guess

53:01.900 --> 53:03.900
Someone who butters margarine with butter

53:04.220 --> 53:06.780
You think we got trody fired today. I don't know

53:07.500 --> 53:11.500
I don't care either weird most of our friends just get jobs to buy Adderall

53:11.980 --> 53:13.500
but he has to like

53:13.500 --> 53:19.180
Support himself just to buy Adderall almost like he has to deal with the consequences of his actions or something

53:19.500 --> 53:25.180
Since when do you of all people worry about accountability? I don't worry about it for my actions. I'm too smart for consequences

53:25.580 --> 53:29.180
It's the one time I feel kind of bad for a guy because he can't do any of the stupid money jobs

53:29.340 --> 53:32.940
Well, he could pole dance. There's nothing stopping him from pole dancing

53:33.660 --> 53:36.140
Though I feel ripped off because I learned how to read from nothing

53:36.460 --> 53:40.460
What if you're too shy and just work out hopes in Los Angeles? Okay hooters is even worse than a club

53:40.540 --> 53:44.860
It's a legalized brothel. What how how do you know this? Is it really worse at one?

53:45.100 --> 53:49.020
She says half the girls blow dudes for like $300 tips. Oh my god. My funny story at Hooters

53:49.020 --> 53:53.660
I have to ask her if that actually happened. That's really specific. That really happens. So what's next?

53:54.220 --> 53:58.700
I think although she got she did make major tips working at Hooters. She has big old knockers too

53:58.780 --> 54:01.180
I'd rather do that than end up the dick-sucking girl at Hooters

54:01.340 --> 54:03.660
You can just say girl at Hooters the dick-sucking is implied

54:04.060 --> 54:09.900
Check please. You're not even paying for it. Just get up and leave. Just dine and dash. Oh my god. They are the worst

54:10.220 --> 54:13.900
There's so much happening. I can't even react properly. You don't know the half of it

54:14.060 --> 54:19.340
Not even a quarter for being honest. Well, the sign and sheet is on the desk the unexcused column

54:19.740 --> 54:25.180
Oh, so we just ended up skipping a school to go to the mall to steal shit and get stuff. Okay. That's cool

54:26.300 --> 54:30.860
Yeah, trauma has to be one of the excused hardies, right? For some reason I don't believe you

54:31.180 --> 54:37.980
But today I think that's your problem. It's being a fucking bitch your problem. Ayo, excuse me. Oh my god. It was the trauma

54:38.060 --> 54:44.460
I'm so sorry. So why don't you both enlighten me to the source of this trauma that's caused absence after absence

54:47.100 --> 54:50.140
Uh lie, but no we're gonna we're gonna pull the depression card

54:51.100 --> 54:53.100
There's a game only on them. I don't know

54:56.540 --> 55:00.460
Because it only gives me the display and the

55:01.740 --> 55:06.140
Volume so I'm like, uh, can I because if I could slow it down

55:06.940 --> 55:08.700
That'd be great

55:08.700 --> 55:10.700
Can I just save? Oh

55:14.540 --> 55:16.540
Just lie about having aids

55:19.340 --> 55:23.180
How do I go back? Hello. Oh my god

55:26.620 --> 55:28.620
Let's see. Oh

55:29.580 --> 55:31.580
Actually, I won't keep lying

55:32.540 --> 55:39.020
Okay, yeah, I'll play this one for now, but next I'm done because I actually do want to play the first game and voice it so

55:40.940 --> 55:42.940
There's I don't think there's any way

55:43.260 --> 55:46.940
For me to not make it just auto play hardcore. No, it's just

55:47.660 --> 55:50.860
We were both like, uh, what she said like I can skip ahead

55:51.580 --> 55:53.740
Honestly, I don't know. It's just

55:54.460 --> 56:00.140
We were both diagnosed with manic depression and it's just hard to show up. Oh my god, sis relatable

56:00.220 --> 56:04.860
She said it just nothing makes me happy anymore. Not even cocaine. Not even cocaine

56:05.980 --> 56:11.340
Is that why she's so skinny? Hmm. I'm not sure we've had that as an excuse before but it's totally real

56:11.660 --> 56:17.900
Come on. Isn't it manic depression real? That's like a combination of bipolar and being depressed

56:19.580 --> 56:21.580
She could have said seasonal depression

56:21.580 --> 56:27.660
When he Houston said we need a whole year that was for black history month. No, it was for mental health

56:29.340 --> 56:33.660
Yeah, maybe they're black. They look black to me anymore. They're just really light skin

56:33.660 --> 56:38.140
I just don't feel feelings or care about anything headed into a downward spiral. Oh my god

56:38.220 --> 56:45.260
Automotive only is a game feature kill myself. Oh, that's good. Yeah, and I'm totally numb to hearing that because of my

56:45.820 --> 56:49.100
Manic depression. All right fine. I'll excuse it this time

56:49.420 --> 56:54.300
But I expect you to seek help if this really is so much. Oh, yeah, a comedian hour

56:55.900 --> 56:58.620
You made my day just a little bit better. I have no

56:58.620 --> 57:05.420
I have no emotion in your way of depression. Remember? I think so. You didn't do shit with Lynn. All right

57:05.580 --> 57:10.300
I think instead of class you should head over to your counselor for additional. I would love to voice in a game like this

57:11.020 --> 57:16.220
Hey, uh principle in you got a minute. Hold on. He just slides in. I thought you dropped out

57:16.540 --> 57:20.860
Well, yeah, I did but I think I want to reenroll what the hell great to hear trody

57:21.260 --> 57:25.500
Why the sudden change of plans? I think it just make going to college a little easier

57:25.740 --> 57:31.100
Also, I got fired from hot topic. They said I let someone steal a shirt. Oh my god. They got a fire

57:32.700 --> 57:36.460
What why do you say that they were in the mall like two hours ago? No

57:37.100 --> 57:39.100
He fucked us

57:39.500 --> 57:43.500
Could you step outside for a bit? Yeah, no problem. I meant trody

57:43.900 --> 57:49.820
Oh, no, we were fucked. Yeah, who can trust what they say manic depression, huh?

57:50.540 --> 57:56.220
Suicidal thoughts and all we had retail therapy right now. So we're not all the way lying. Exactly

57:57.420 --> 58:00.700
Worth it for a t-shirt at the mall. You must be so

58:01.020 --> 58:05.500
Yes, I'm self destructive. Why do you think I'm stealing t-shirts? It's a cry for help

58:08.060 --> 58:11.500
Dude, can we just go to an easier book this is the easier book

58:11.660 --> 58:16.140
Is everyone in the reading buddies program this stupid? Hey, the principal sent you here to help me

58:16.220 --> 58:22.060
So make good or I'm snitching hard. Okay. Kylar. What are these names? Surf and Co's. Let's be like amber conby

58:23.020 --> 58:25.020
Oh my god, bin Laden

58:25.020 --> 58:27.020
Who has fucked you raw?

58:27.340 --> 58:28.700
two

58:28.700 --> 58:35.340
Fist uh, oh my gosh, hard one on purpose. It's a dr. Seuss book. You fucking did he cannot be this dumb

58:35.420 --> 58:39.820
If it's so easy, why don't you try it, huh? One fish two fish redfish you bitch

58:39.820 --> 58:48.460
Blue fish. See, I knew you couldn't do it. This is a really potent punishment. No, I want to drop out

58:50.620 --> 58:56.620
For real, let's go to here. Let's go to Hooters get some tips. I don't think they will I think you have to be at to work at Hooters though

58:56.780 --> 59:02.460
It's senior year. You're not. Oh my god. She's like very seen haircut. I'm not either, but you sound like a sitcom

59:02.540 --> 59:07.500
Here we go again. I feel like I'm just reacting to a tv. So this is just a watch along at this point

59:07.500 --> 59:11.980
I'm like, where the hell did you get so much at all? My boyfriend's 25. I can get whatever

59:11.980 --> 59:15.740
Her boyfriend's 25? Sweetie. You're being groomed

59:15.980 --> 59:18.860
Eight year age gap. That's pretty cool. That should work out. Yeah

59:19.180 --> 59:23.660
The irony in her voice start giving out free syringes at south county south county high school

59:24.060 --> 59:26.860
Uh-huh before they were trying to curb the opioid addiction

59:27.100 --> 59:31.580
But now they're just trying to keep all the kids from getting hapsi or whatever because I could like remove their voices

59:31.980 --> 59:33.980
I would just be speaking really fast

59:34.300 --> 59:35.420
Socks

59:35.420 --> 59:41.500
Oh, do you do that? She shoots up my boyfriend got me into it, but it's just lines

59:41.660 --> 59:45.900
Not just nothing serious your boyfriend dating you in high school got you into heroin

59:46.060 --> 59:50.460
You guys are gonna be awesome. Oh my god. Match made in heaven. What do you want the needles for for him?

59:50.860 --> 59:56.860
Because he did it so much that like eventually doesn't hit. So like he has like track marks in his arms in his feet

59:57.340 --> 59:59.340
It's crazy

01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:02.220
What happens to some good holy

01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:08.540
Yeah, I'll see you there. I feel pretty educated on stuff because I just been to watch euphoria. So I'm like, uh

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:12.460
Yes, well, yeah, I get references now

01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:18.300
Usually when I look in the mirror, all I see is a self-destructive pill popping hoe after five minutes with her

01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:20.380
I feel like Selena Gomez

01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:22.940
Like you feel Mexican

01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:28.220
I have school, Nicole. You'd fuck that school. Shit. So from everything we had to do

01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:32.860
Oh, no, I'll make I'll make them go to class euphoria. Um, no, not that euphoria

01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:39.660
No, the tv show euphoria. It's a tv show with Zendaya

01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:48.700
Okay, let's go to the theater class. Let's go

01:00:49.420 --> 01:00:51.260
Crispin here

01:00:51.260 --> 01:00:56.060
Emily. Uh-huh. Yeah, watch I was watching euphoria the from face connect

01:00:56.780 --> 01:01:03.500
We do it right. Do you want right taking attendance? Nicole tardy. Which one's the teacher tardy in here

01:01:03.820 --> 01:01:09.100
Meaning you're late since when are you in charge of that your student like the rest of us? Okay? I was gonna say last week

01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:14.300
Not anymore. Ms. Tegan made me student teacher while she's off working on a that's not how that works

01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:18.060
I get you a substitute dunking those nuts

01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:23.100
Acting sucks. Well, I thought it's just pastes of the board. Well, I don't think you're a good actor either

01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:27.420
You probably couldn't even lie to the police. Yeah, honestly, don't take her side. Why not?

01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:33.180
She's right because I'm your student. Wait. Why is like Jesus crossed out on his shirt or her shirt?

01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:35.580
I really can't tell I ever killed himself while dating you

01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:38.780
So anyway, today we'll break up

01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:43.820
One'll do a table read exercise. The other will be improvised acting

01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:48.140
So who wants to do what I don't want to do anything the teacher isn't even here

01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:54.300
I just can't wrap my head around if my teacher's like, sorry, I have to go on and do this thing and this puts a student in charge

01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:57.020
Yeah, that's not jesus. Who is that?

01:01:57.500 --> 01:02:01.900
Not pretty enough to be in movies. I don't get why you want to act acting isn't about looks

01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:05.900
It's about talent and creativity. This is about written character, but you want to see it for a while

01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:10.060
Stop calling me ugly. No, I'm not calling you ugly. I am

01:02:12.620 --> 01:02:17.020
I am you look like the girl from harry potter, but not photogenic

01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:19.260
Go off says

01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:35.020
Should do a group improv or table reading

01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:42.140
It's too improv. I think they'll be funnier

01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:45.580
So how do we do this?

01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:49.500
Wait, maybe I can just like let's see if I can read it fast

01:02:51.420 --> 01:02:55.340
Let's see if I can read it fast because like I feel like I'm doing nothing

01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:04.540
I give you guys a snare. Oh, yeah, it makes sense. So the scene is you're a newlywed husband and wife in 1949

01:03:04.540 --> 01:03:06.540
The wife wants to know what the war was like

01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:12.140
What if he doesn't know what the war was like

01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:15.820
It was 1949 everyone was just getting out of the war at least knew someone, right?

01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:19.020
The

01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:21.020
Okay, so we go now

01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:22.780
Yeah action

01:03:22.780 --> 01:03:25.340
Hey, you seem kind of upset. Is there a thing you want to talk about?

01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:30.620
Nah, I'm good. Oh, well, do you want to hear about the war?

01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:32.780
No

01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:37.100
Wait, wait, megans. You can never say no for improv. It just like makes it go nowhere

01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:40.060
That was the plan

01:03:40.060 --> 01:03:45.420
Well, I guess don't do that. All right, let's try again. Hey wife something on your mind

01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:48.380
Yeah, um, there's something I've been wanting to stay lately

01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:51.420
Oh, what's that the end?

01:04:10.060 --> 01:04:12.060
Oh

01:04:23.180 --> 01:04:27.660
Why do you want to say that it's 1949, isn't it tell me if you see

01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:31.340
Oh, maybe oh, so let me just

01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:42.140
I'm gonna I'm gonna be honest with you

01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:59.340
I have the pass so it's fun. I may not vtuber look like I have the pass, but I have the pass

01:05:04.220 --> 01:05:08.300
I did mention my dad is proud of my mom this way. So this is like

01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:11.500
I

01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:13.500
Can't cancel me if I'm brown

01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:16.460
I'm getting that tan toggle

01:05:16.460 --> 01:05:19.420
Prove it. Well, you'll see it in the the monetization stream

01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:25.420
I was like, I'm like, I didn't know I'll be honest with you. I didn't know how people would react if they're like, oh

01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:28.700
She's white vtuber, but she's

01:05:29.420 --> 01:05:30.780
light-skinned tan

01:05:30.780 --> 01:05:35.340
Iro, uh, like I don't really give a shit play who I play. I'm an anime girl on the internet

01:05:35.420 --> 01:05:37.980
I have fucking bunny ears like it's whatever

01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:44.700
But yes, uh, I wanted you if you were gonna find out anyways when I do a hand cam stream and a

01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:47.820
thigh cam. So let's just continue

01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:50.300
The n-word is probably

01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:52.860
With no repercussions

01:05:52.860 --> 01:06:00.940
1949's a great year for me. Uh, I'm glad you're happy. Yeah. Oh, you see that see what that different colored family pulling up in a

01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:02.940
Lincoln you want to do the honors

01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:06.300
What are the honors calling them the n-word? Duh

01:06:06.620 --> 01:06:12.940
Why would I do that? It's 1949. Why wouldn't you all right? Um, is there anything else you want to talk about?

01:06:14.060 --> 01:06:16.060
Yeah, you want to

01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:18.060
It's not all right now

01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:36.700
I can't my

01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:51.100
I love this game so far. I love it

01:07:03.100 --> 01:07:05.340
I think reading is the best option. Are you kidding me?

01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:10.380
And my love to manager

01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:18.140
Oh

01:07:19.660 --> 01:07:21.660
No, but another no

01:07:21.980 --> 01:07:24.480
It tells you get that word of your vocabulary if you're gonna do this exercise

01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:31.580
Yeah, but the situation got kind of the situation doesn't matter. It's improv no matter what you never use the n-word

01:07:32.220 --> 01:07:35.020
If you do it again, I'll have full power to fail you for the quarter

01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:37.340
Jesus

01:07:37.340 --> 01:07:39.340
All right, so uh resume scene

01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:44.700
But yeah, honey should we sign up for the 1949 kkk initiation

01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:49.260
Okay, great to hear by the way. Could you tell me about the war?

01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:56.060
Oh and use the n-word as much as possible when describing it and scene. All right, so how do we do?

01:07:56.700 --> 01:07:58.700
Uh, i'm gonna have to talk with megan

01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:01.500
shit

01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:08.300
Nicole dude class is over. What do you want? I just need to have a little talk with you

01:08:09.020 --> 01:08:11.020
About your partisan

01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:13.420
Can I be honest?

01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:15.900
Okay, is that it or

01:08:16.060 --> 01:08:20.540
You're not getting it. I'm your teacher in this class. It'll treat me as such this disingenuous attitude

01:08:20.620 --> 01:08:22.620
Isn't gonna fly in my program got it

01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:29.420
Dude, what the fuck ever I just told you don't treat me like i'm your classmate. I'm your teacher. Is that how you talk to your teachers?

01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:35.180
Actually, yeah, don't lie to me. Oh my god, chill out if you don't get your shit together

01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:40.220
I'm gonna call miss teegan and tell her everything. She's gonna write you up for in school suspension

01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:45.580
So think it's all fun and games. Nicole. Yeah, sure side note. Are you withdrawing from bipolar meds right now?

01:08:45.980 --> 01:08:50.860
Don't change the subject. We're talking about you and your issues right now. Jesus christ, okay

01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:56.540
You think you just smirk while emily calls me an ugly Hermione? I had no part of that. Go ahead. Call me ugly again

01:08:57.180 --> 01:09:01.900
No, thanks. Can I go? Oh, see now you get it. Now you're treating me like your teacher

01:09:02.700 --> 01:09:06.860
Okay, megan. Yeah, it's miss megan. Miss megan. Can I get the fuck out of here now?

01:09:07.260 --> 01:09:09.740
You're excused sweetie, but work on the foul language

01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:12.860
Work on getting a fucking therapist. Holy shit

01:09:12.860 --> 01:09:14.860
Oh

01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:40.300
Oh my god, there's so many clips out of context. I'm gonna be speedrun

01:09:40.300 --> 01:09:42.300
I can't stop

01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:51.820
Oh my tommy, okay, um

01:09:53.260 --> 01:09:57.740
Oh special card. Hey, was this again the english sub today. She was so old and talkative

01:09:59.020 --> 01:10:01.580
At least you can go on your phone, right? That was the worst part

01:10:01.660 --> 01:10:04.220
She stopped her boring story to get anyone with their phone out

01:10:04.860 --> 01:10:07.340
A sub that won't let you screw around want to rip off

01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:10.700
I don't know how someone manages to be more boring than regular shit

01:10:11.580 --> 01:10:13.580
Weird. Yeah, I had a sub today too

01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:17.820
How'd that go the drama teacher nominee just student teaches a class while she's out of school

01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:23.580
What the fuck? I know why would she pick a student, right? No. Why are you in drama?

01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:27.100
It's a gimme class. Don't worry. I have no intention of being a fucking actor

01:10:27.580 --> 01:10:32.140
Good the drama kids are so fucking annoying. They're all ugly yet. Some I think they're gonna be in a movie one day

01:10:32.700 --> 01:10:35.660
Yeah, that's pretty much the student teacher who's a massive bitch, by the way

01:10:36.220 --> 01:10:40.540
Do I know her? Do you know megan? I was in second grade with her. Why is she a bitch?

01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:46.220
No, I'm just doing whatever not really caring and then she stops me outside after class and gets super in my face about it

01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:49.020
Because you weren't acting good enough

01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:54.380
I guess but she's like i'm gonna fucking write you up get you suspended and all this shit and i'm just standing there

01:10:55.100 --> 01:11:01.180
Uh, that makes a lot of sense now. So until she was a tantrum kid in second grade every week was a freak out

01:11:01.660 --> 01:11:07.100
Once a tantrum kid. Oh, it's a tantrum kid. Yeah control freak for real. So are you gonna drop the class?

01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:12.940
No, i'm good. I'm gonna drop her ass though. Aren't you a little too old for revenge? Oh, so now you're taking her side

01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:15.180
No, no, I support you. I'm just not getting involved

01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:18.460
Because you have such a future, right? Apparently more than you

01:11:19.180 --> 01:11:23.740
Future or no future revenge is a dish best served cold like pizza. She's wrong. No

01:11:24.700 --> 01:11:31.500
Wow, you do seriously eat pizza cold. Yeah, what's wrong with that? Now, I know you're out of your fucking mind

01:11:33.820 --> 01:11:36.300
Ew, I hate like greasy solidified

01:11:37.420 --> 01:11:39.580
This is very much visual novel e

01:11:40.300 --> 01:11:42.300
twit longest cancellation

01:11:42.940 --> 01:11:45.500
I'm canceling she be cotton bum

01:11:47.420 --> 01:11:48.940
I hate cold pizza

01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:53.660
I'll eat it. I don't like it though tickets for what? Oh my god. You really forgot again

01:11:53.740 --> 01:11:55.740
the dinner theater

01:11:55.740 --> 01:11:57.980
Oh, yeah, I can like order those tonight still

01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:00.860
Tompather, I'll see what myself

01:12:01.100 --> 01:12:05.580
Sorry. Yeah, okay. If you were actually sorry, wouldn't have fucked it up in the first time

01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:08.140
Yeah, I'll try better next time

01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:11.660
Stress out enough teaching this class. She's so annoying

01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:17.900
Does this he's our student too. What do you mean student too? They're dating. You didn't know that

01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:21.980
No, but it checks out. I thought it was kind of weird. He was the only one in class not making fun of her

01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:26.700
I know for a fact he wants out of it too. He's flirted with like three of my friends so far

01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:29.500
Not surprising a bitch like her I cheat on her too

01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:37.260
She's not weird category of just barely putting enough to be super demanding. What pretty enough. Oh god the sex with her must be so bad

01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:40.940
I didn't even think he's getting that she was raised catholic like super prudish

01:12:41.980 --> 01:12:45.980
Do you just know everything about this bitch? What I've been around longer. You just hear this shit

01:12:46.300 --> 01:12:48.700
All right, don't worry about it because I think I have my in

01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:50.860
in for what

01:12:50.860 --> 01:12:55.100
Megan's life a boyfriend isn't she isn't fucking is the perfect weakness for me to exploit

01:12:56.620 --> 01:12:58.780
This is starting to sound like a red tube video

01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:03.340
Ew, I'm not gonna fuck him. Okay. Just checking because every second the video there sounds exactly like that

01:13:03.820 --> 01:13:09.820
Like what like oh you killed my parents. I'll show you what the most suffocating blowjob ever can share on video

01:13:11.660 --> 01:13:16.780
Dude, how much red tube do you watch? Don't worry about it. Fine. But anyway, me and hunter share a science class next period

01:13:17.660 --> 01:13:21.820
That's convenient. What are you gonna do? Let's say I'm gonna

01:13:22.620 --> 01:13:24.620
order a hot pizza

01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:27.020
Are you gonna wait for it to get cold?

01:13:27.740 --> 01:13:29.740
You know me so well

01:13:32.220 --> 01:13:34.860
Oh my god, I feel like pause so I can look at chat

01:13:35.740 --> 01:13:39.980
So I don't want to steal the boyfriend. I don't like people like that, but

01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:44.220
Come to me. Yeah, I could potentially niffle. She is pretty based

01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:50.620
She is pretty base. You want me to steal her boyfriends? I'll do I honestly like normally

01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:55.980
For real though, I would never do such a thing, but she is so fucking annoying this mega girl

01:13:57.900 --> 01:14:01.180
Nicole is not going to do that. Is she gonna like throw pizza in his face?

01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:04.220
That's right. We'll finish

01:14:04.780 --> 01:14:07.580
My wife killed herself. Any questions, Jeffrey?

01:14:09.340 --> 01:14:11.900
Uh, yeah, when's our science lab gonna be about today?

01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:14.860
I mean questions about my wife killing herself

01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:20.700
Oh, sorry, no

01:14:20.780 --> 01:14:26.300
So for Tay's lab will be identifying which element is based on its massive volume. Get into your groups while I grab the supplies

01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:33.260
But like there is always that one teacher that like dumps too much

01:14:33.980 --> 01:14:35.980
Are you gonna be okay?

01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:38.940
Oh, yeah, I got up. It's bullshit effort doing it alone

01:14:39.900 --> 01:14:41.900
I could partner with you if you want

01:14:42.460 --> 01:14:47.420
Really? I thought you hated this class while we're both in drama. So it might help get to know each other if we're gonna act

01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:50.460
I thought you hated that class too

01:14:50.460 --> 01:14:51.900
I'm warming up to it

01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:56.780
Mom and Nicole, I thought we were lab partners. Shut the fuck up. Go away. She's fucking christ

01:14:59.180 --> 01:15:04.700
Wasn't that kind of harsh yesterday. He was telling about how he kills dogs in his backyard. I can't work with someone like that

01:15:05.260 --> 01:15:10.700
Uh, okay, I guess that was justified sit with me. Cool

01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:14.220
You don't mind if I look at porn on my phone, do you?

01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:17.180
Uh, no

01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:20.700
Awesome. Yeah, it's something I do when I'm bored. That's not tmi. Is it?

01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:24.460
Uh, I'm okay with it. But uh, why do you do it at school?

01:15:27.580 --> 01:15:31.580
Kind of add something to it. I don't know. So what are you doing after school?

01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:37.100
I gotta go to the dentist for cavity. You always make me gag with all those tools. I hate it

01:15:38.220 --> 01:15:39.900
You like the dentist?

01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:44.460
What? No, I meant gagging. I don't have a gag reflex. Oh, you're so lucky

01:15:45.100 --> 01:15:48.460
I don't think luck had anything to do with it. I like testing my limits

01:15:49.180 --> 01:15:51.180
Oh, you mean like uh

01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:56.380
Yeah, like that, but don't worry. I know Megan's your girlfriend. I won't cross any lines. I'm just honest about myself

01:15:57.340 --> 01:16:03.260
Oh my god, she's so bad. Honestly, she's good. I don't mind it. Sweet. I think we'll just get along fine in drama

01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:07.180
By the way, I realized you're technically dating your teacher ultimate fantasy, right?

01:16:08.620 --> 01:16:10.620
Uh, I guess so

01:16:10.940 --> 01:16:13.980
She's an actor actor too. Do you guys have a role play?

01:16:14.780 --> 01:16:16.780
No, can't say we do

01:16:17.260 --> 01:16:22.060
I guess she's burned out after acting at school. I can't like maintain Nicole's voice because it'll slip into jecca

01:16:23.420 --> 01:16:25.420
But me personally, I love role playing

01:16:26.060 --> 01:16:30.380
Oh, cool. Some kind of things you play. You have a girlfriend. You're asking me about my role playing

01:16:30.940 --> 01:16:35.180
Oh, no, no, no. I'm sorry. I mean to relax. I'm fucking with you. Honestly, you don't need to worry

01:16:36.220 --> 01:16:40.780
I have a sixth sense for relationships and I can tell I have I'm so sorry. Excuse me

01:16:41.900 --> 01:16:43.820
How fun is she?

01:16:43.820 --> 01:16:49.020
Okay, don't tell her I told you this but just based on her personality. I can tell she gives amazing head. Am I right?

01:16:52.700 --> 01:16:54.940
Uh, your sixth sense might need some work

01:16:55.580 --> 01:17:00.380
Oh my god, I was wrong. Is she really bad at it? She doesn't really do any of that

01:17:01.260 --> 01:17:03.900
How long have you been dating a few months now?

01:17:04.540 --> 01:17:09.580
Wow, I'm really sorry your relationship like that. Do you want my number in case you want to vent or anything?

01:17:09.660 --> 01:17:12.060
Oh my god, that's so toxic

01:17:13.900 --> 01:17:16.860
What did you mention the relationship does feel kind of manipulative sometimes

01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:23.900
And that's why I want to be there for you because trust me. I know all about manipulative relationships

01:17:24.460 --> 01:17:27.100
He's so fucking bad. Holy shit

01:17:27.900 --> 01:17:30.140
Okay, so again, this is romance improv

01:17:30.220 --> 01:17:33.500
We're just gonna need to see who's best for a mini production at Romeo and Juliet

01:17:34.140 --> 01:17:35.420
Who's going first?

01:17:35.420 --> 01:17:39.500
Well, we need a guy and a girl hunter. Why don't you go first? I smack my mic. All right, sure

01:17:40.540 --> 01:17:42.540
Now who's gonna play the other side? Emily

01:17:43.420 --> 01:17:47.500
This far romance. Yes romance improv. No, he's ugly

01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:49.580
I'll do it

01:17:49.660 --> 01:17:52.300
Seriously? Yeah, why not get better if I don't practice, right?

01:17:52.940 --> 01:17:54.380
Okay, go ahead

01:17:54.380 --> 01:17:55.740
What's the scene again?

01:17:55.740 --> 01:17:59.980
You're about to go to prison for 10 years and this is your last conversation with your girlfriend

01:18:01.100 --> 01:18:03.020
scandalous

01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:05.020
This might be the last time we ever talk face to face

01:18:06.300 --> 01:18:08.460
Are you sure you'll beat the case? I know you

01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:13.420
My lawyer said it's not looking good. If I'm lucky, I'll get out in five for good for behavior

01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:19.100
This is not Romeo and Juliet. We're just gonna take that you're free now, aren't you? What do you mean?

01:18:19.580 --> 01:18:25.020
Let's run away to Mexico. They won't find you there. I would but this ankle monitor isn't doing me any favors

01:18:26.860 --> 01:18:29.180
Just cut it off. I don't have any scissors

01:18:30.220 --> 01:18:33.340
Okay, that makes sense. So you're really just gonna serve the time

01:18:34.620 --> 01:18:39.020
No other options, but what about me? What am I gonna do with myself without you?

01:18:39.820 --> 01:18:41.820
Do you think you can wait for me on the outside?

01:18:43.020 --> 01:18:46.060
I don't know. All your friends really want to have sex with me

01:18:46.540 --> 01:18:51.500
Look, I can't control you from the inside. Just keep me in the dark about it. Jesus

01:18:53.740 --> 01:18:56.540
You're giving up that easy. I thought you loved me

01:18:57.260 --> 01:18:58.860
I guess not enough

01:18:58.860 --> 01:19:01.500
You're just telling yourself that to feel less bad about missing me

01:19:01.740 --> 01:19:05.100
But actually speak louder than words whenever you touch me. I know the truth

01:19:07.260 --> 01:19:09.260
But but what am I supposed to do

01:19:09.980 --> 01:19:14.380
Touch me one more time take me to my limit with your last sign of freedom and don't ever forget the feeling

01:19:16.140 --> 01:19:21.580
Uh, uh and scene what we can't keep going. I was about to suck a stick

01:19:23.820 --> 01:19:26.140
Not the ntr not the net

01:19:27.660 --> 01:19:29.180
No

01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:35.100
No, we can't see but i'm putting my arms up in an x. No, no, we do not support ntr here

01:19:35.660 --> 01:19:37.660
We do not support ntr

01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:42.380

You like powerless humiliation. Yeah. Yeah, that's true

01:21:40.700 --> 01:21:43.260
You're all my brother and sister husband wives

01:23:24.060 --> 01:23:26.060
Oh my god. Thank you

01:23:26.380 --> 01:23:28.380
Little weird she took that as a compliment

Nicole, I need another talk with you. Shit. I went overboard for what nothing. What's the problem this time?

01:23:34.460 --> 01:23:37.660
Actually, there's no problem at all. I just want to let you know. I really appreciate the effort today

01:23:38.380 --> 01:23:46.380
Wait, seriously? Yeah, you're seen with hunter today showed a lot of passion actually kind of moved me

01:23:47.900 --> 01:23:51.740
It's like you were really trying to make him fall in love with you. It showed a lot of talent

01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:55.500
Oh, well, okay. Thanks

01:23:56.140 --> 01:23:59.100
And Nicole, I just want to say i'm really sorry for being so hard on you

01:24:00.140 --> 01:24:02.940
At first I thought you were just another disingenuous white kid

01:24:04.060 --> 01:24:06.060
You're white too

01:24:09.180 --> 01:24:11.180
I

01:24:11.740 --> 01:24:13.740
Told you it's miss Megan

01:24:15.340 --> 01:24:17.340
I'm sorry. It's like

01:24:18.140 --> 01:24:22.380
This was like my childhood friends basement. That's kind of funny. Um

01:24:23.900 --> 01:24:26.860
It's really funny when me to me when like

01:24:27.740 --> 01:24:29.740
Never mind

01:24:29.900 --> 01:24:34.700
People refer to other people white people for other people as just a white person. I'm like you're white

01:24:34.940 --> 01:24:36.940
Oh

01:24:37.660 --> 01:24:41.020
Butt implants. Yeah, I don't get either in this group of slides on their leg. What?

01:24:42.140 --> 01:24:44.140
Ew gross. Do you want to say?

01:24:45.420 --> 01:24:48.860
Taxing someone right now. You've been on the phone like all day. Who are you talking to?

01:24:49.740 --> 01:24:54.220
Little Caesars cold and ready. Oh, I almost forgot. Yeah, how's it's going? Megan's boyfriend

01:24:54.620 --> 01:24:57.420
I'm making some pretty good progress and so far. I got 10

01:24:57.980 --> 01:25:01.740
11 pictures of his dick so far. God damn. He's desperate. Jesus. Fuck

01:25:02.300 --> 01:25:06.380
I'm trying to get one of this face in it too so I can prove it's him. Yeah, I rest like it'd be anyone's dick

01:25:06.700 --> 01:25:08.860
But what if he's checking you with a picture of someone else's?

01:25:09.180 --> 01:25:14.700
Why would a guy carrying around 11 angles of someone else's erection? He could be gay. He's definitely not gay

01:25:15.020 --> 01:25:17.420
No gay guy would ski in mom's jewelry box for me

01:25:18.940 --> 01:25:21.980
Why would he do that in his mom's jewelry box?

01:25:24.220 --> 01:25:28.300
I told him it really turned me on and within 90 seconds he sent a picture of it. You want to see

01:25:29.100 --> 01:25:34.060
Uh, yeah, look at this. Jesus Christ. It's fucked

01:25:35.340 --> 01:25:37.340
Pearl necklace on a pearl necklace

01:25:40.860 --> 01:25:42.860
Ew and circumcised

01:25:44.620 --> 01:25:46.620
I'm gonna throw up and circumcised mentioned

01:25:47.340 --> 01:25:49.340
Oh

01:25:57.580 --> 01:26:01.260
He'll wear this guy for literally nothing as it stands or technically into him

01:26:03.740 --> 01:26:05.740
I could not let that happen

01:26:07.420 --> 01:26:09.420
Brother

01:26:11.980 --> 01:26:14.860
Couldn't tell you or maybe we multiply the density by the mass

01:26:17.100 --> 01:26:21.020
Dude, I'm feeling this class. Anyway, who gives a shit is something bothering you right now

01:26:21.820 --> 01:26:25.900
Not really. It's just caring about science for white guys are correct. You're a grammar

01:26:26.540 --> 01:26:29.420
All right. Actually, there's been starting something I've been thinking about lately

01:26:31.660 --> 01:26:35.660
Oh, you don't correct my grammar. No, not that just us

01:26:36.780 --> 01:26:40.460
What about us? Who does he have on a shirt? I had fun texting last night

01:26:40.940 --> 01:26:45.180
No, I looked at you. It's just I think about how I feel talking to you and compare it with talking to megan

01:26:45.340 --> 01:26:50.620
And I don't think she actually likes me. She's gay. Megan's gay. She's gay. She's gay. She's a catholic gay. She's a catholic gay

01:26:51.500 --> 01:26:53.180
What? How so?

01:26:53.180 --> 01:26:55.180
She just doesn't humor me the way you do

01:26:55.180 --> 01:26:57.980
Does it feel like she actually loves me? You're in high school. You don't love each other

01:26:58.700 --> 01:27:01.340
Are you sure? I think you can stick it out a lot longer

01:27:01.900 --> 01:27:05.500
I could but I really don't want to it's no fun being with some bossy prude

01:27:05.820 --> 01:27:08.220
If you like me for me, she would have done something by now

01:27:10.620 --> 01:27:12.620
Okay, that's a little bit problematic

01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:23.260
Love does he not equate to sexual gratification? Get it through your heads. Don't pressure girls and claim

01:27:25.020 --> 01:27:27.500
That you love them if you love me you would fuck me

01:27:30.380 --> 01:27:33.020
But especially in high school

01:27:36.460 --> 01:27:39.420
Just break up with her and go screw some other girl that wants to have sex

01:27:42.620 --> 01:27:44.620
She just needs time and good

01:27:45.580 --> 01:27:47.580
I

01:27:49.100 --> 01:27:52.940
I'm sorry. I just wasn't funny. Keep what up like sending you all those pictures

01:27:53.900 --> 01:27:59.900
Amy when you came in your mom's jewelry box. Does anyone need my help over here? Yeah, actually for the no, we're fine. Just thinking

01:28:00.540 --> 01:28:01.820
okay

01:28:01.820 --> 01:28:03.820
Jeffrey could you draw a better picture?

01:28:05.820 --> 01:28:07.820
But yeah, the jewelry box. Yeah among others

01:28:09.180 --> 01:28:10.780
That was really hot by the way

01:28:10.780 --> 01:28:13.580
You really thought so I had another one like that, but I forgot to send it

01:28:14.140 --> 01:28:18.860
Did you clean that another jewelry box? No, it was my brother's uno collection

01:28:21.660 --> 01:28:23.660
Like uno the restaurant

01:28:24.220 --> 01:28:26.220
No uno the card game

01:28:26.460 --> 01:28:29.020
Oh, how can you have a collection of uno?

01:28:29.740 --> 01:28:33.820
Like all the different versions nfl uno batman uno simpsons uno

01:28:34.780 --> 01:28:38.540
That's all you just put them all together and blew a fat load on them

01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:42.940
Yeah, I'm always doing it. I was thinking about you and oh god, listen to me

01:28:45.900 --> 01:28:48.700
What's wrong we're just having a normal conversation

01:28:49.740 --> 01:28:53.100
Megan has no idea we're doing this. It feels kind of messed up. Yeah, you're cheating on her

01:28:54.700 --> 01:28:56.700
That's why I feel guilty bro

01:28:57.100 --> 01:29:00.540
Her relationship with her is like long-term romance the kind of thing and like dating or whatever

01:29:00.940 --> 01:29:02.940
She really loves you, but then

01:29:09.500 --> 01:29:11.500
I

01:29:15.100 --> 01:29:17.100
Can't keep up

01:29:17.180 --> 01:29:22.780
She won't explore your urges and nothing we're finding someone who will besides it's only cheating if you say you love me. Mm-hmm

01:29:23.900 --> 01:29:25.900
So if you say you love me

01:29:26.300 --> 01:29:28.700
You can't see I'm pointing at the camera right now. I'm pointing at my phone

01:29:28.860 --> 01:29:32.140
If you say you love me you're cheating on your oh she unless your oh, she's me

01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:35.660
Just saying

01:29:36.140 --> 01:29:39.100
Are you are you are you a cheater? No that you

01:29:39.900 --> 01:29:43.180
So leave me for your oh leave leave your oh she for me

01:29:49.900 --> 01:29:51.900
I'm so fucked up

01:29:53.500 --> 01:29:56.000
Oh fuck I love Hina. No, wait. No

01:30:01.900 --> 01:30:04.620
I'm sorry, she'd be a great, but I can't my heart

No, yeah, it's only it's only been

01:30:09.660 --> 01:30:13.900
Yeah, you guys you guys say you don't like ntr, but you're all cheating on your oh, she's

01:30:14.620 --> 01:30:19.500
Wait, no, wait. Don't leave. Don't leave me. Don't leave. Am I the other woman?

01:30:20.620 --> 01:30:22.620
Am I

01:30:22.860 --> 01:30:25.420
Is is veeler the other corpo

01:30:28.060 --> 01:30:31.260
You leave your oh, she's streamed to sneak into ours

01:30:35.980 --> 01:30:37.980
Oh

01:30:39.820 --> 01:30:43.740
No, what have I done? What have I realized?

01:30:48.300 --> 01:30:55.420
I'm I'm a normal girl. I'm say so. I'm good. No, it's not this bad. No, I'm not I'm not a whore

01:30:55.900 --> 01:31:02.940
I'm not a whore. I'm a good girl. I'm not wearing shabari ropes for an outfit. I'm not the side. Oh, she I'm the I'm the commy

01:31:06.060 --> 01:31:08.060

The new veeler girls seem really nice and then she's like watching me right now

01:31:54.700 --> 01:31:57.100
And then she's like and then she sees me just talking about this

01:31:58.060 --> 01:32:00.060
No, this isn't a clip don't clip this

01:32:00.540 --> 01:32:02.540
No

01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:10.380
The only negative to having a larger audience now is that I just can't nuke vods when I was like a

01:32:11.020 --> 01:32:14.940
One view on twitch. I would just fucking delete shit because I'd be like

01:32:16.300 --> 01:32:18.300
Arise it

01:32:20.460 --> 01:32:26.060
I don't want to be the other girl. I don't want to be the other woman. I feel bad being the other woman

01:32:27.500 --> 01:32:29.500
I

01:32:36.300 --> 01:32:41.180
Because I want to be friends and it's even fucked up because I probably want to be friends with your oh, she

Anyways, let's continue my tummy

Actually, we don't bring containment

01:32:59.420 --> 01:33:02.460
Yeah, it's been the rule since forever as long as we don't kiss and all that mushy stuff

Yeah, I'll have to do the sunday, huh going blind and just forgive me father for I've sinned

01:33:49.820 --> 01:33:56.540
So you're telling me you blindly say to a guy all the sex shit you did over the week and call him father but not daddy

01:33:57.180 --> 01:33:59.180
What I don't what do you mean?

01:33:59.980 --> 01:34:03.740
Sorry red tube. What's so you what he doesn't want red tube is

01:34:03.740 --> 01:34:08.220
Nicole, please report to the counselor's office repeat. Nicole, please report to the counselor's office. Thank you

01:34:08.220 --> 01:34:10.220
Oh, wait. No, she's a mommy voice. Hold on

01:34:10.220 --> 01:34:12.220
Looks like I gotta go. I'll get back to you on that though

01:34:13.260 --> 01:34:15.260
I mean just let me know by Friday

01:34:16.220 --> 01:34:19.820
This is the first time being here is less awkward than where I just was

01:34:21.020 --> 01:34:23.820
Nicole, I hope I'm not interrupting too much with your class

01:34:24.220 --> 01:34:29.100
It was actually a perfect amount of interruption regardless. I wouldn't knock you off your newfound drive

01:34:29.660 --> 01:34:33.980
Driving where I mean your effort your sudden passion for scholastic participation

01:34:34.780 --> 01:34:37.100
Since when did you just lie to get me in here?

01:34:37.900 --> 01:34:44.300
Of course not you're saying you haven't gone the extra mile in theater and science lately your teachers in both spoke very highly of you

01:34:46.220 --> 01:34:48.220
Oh, they have

01:34:48.300 --> 01:34:52.780
Yes, they're very both very impressed with their sudden initiative when it comes to participating in the classroom

01:34:53.100 --> 01:34:57.820
Quite frankly, it's pleasantly surprising to hear you giving your prior reputation being a whore

01:34:59.500 --> 01:35:02.300
As your counselor it'd be important to know what's the sudden inspiration

01:35:03.260 --> 01:35:05.260
Should we live long enough to become the villain?

01:35:06.140 --> 01:35:08.700
Uh drama and science couldn't tell you. I'm just really smart I guess

01:35:09.180 --> 01:35:13.020
Well, either way great to see one of our most beautiful students. This is just a pretty fit

01:35:13.980 --> 01:35:15.980
Hold up

01:35:17.340 --> 01:35:18.780
What did he say?

01:35:18.780 --> 01:35:22.300
Not to mention dark daring fashion sense. You have a knack for turning heads, don't you?

01:35:22.620 --> 01:35:29.420
Well, now you're really flirting. Nothing flirtatious about admiring creative mind. You picked out such vibrant shorts. They shape you over. I am uncomfortable

01:35:31.020 --> 01:35:33.020
Hold on

01:35:37.820 --> 01:35:39.820
You know, I'm not gonna lie to you

01:35:39.900 --> 01:35:46.060
Some of this shit like definitely happened at my high school because actually my middle school

01:35:47.900 --> 01:35:49.500
Um

01:35:49.500 --> 01:35:51.500
Southern grade one of my uh

01:35:52.140 --> 01:35:55.260
Teachers slept with the students. It was very fucked up

01:35:55.420 --> 01:35:59.820
It was so fucked up and it sucked because that girl was my friend and I really liked that teacher

01:36:00.940 --> 01:36:05.020
And he's in jail. I can't see but I'm holding thumbs up

01:36:05.340 --> 01:36:13.660
Yeah, it was bad. It was really bad and now she works at Olive Garden

01:36:16.140 --> 01:36:18.140
Why don't you give me a twirl

01:36:18.780 --> 01:36:20.780
I'm having PTSD

01:36:20.780 --> 01:36:24.140
Um, it's like it's it's so like why

01:36:25.500 --> 01:36:26.620
like

01:36:26.620 --> 01:36:28.620
gross

01:36:28.620 --> 01:36:31.980
Stop praying on people like stop praying on kids

01:36:32.940 --> 01:36:34.940
It's where you get all your breadsticks

01:36:35.100 --> 01:36:37.100
That's how I become on that. No

01:36:37.980 --> 01:36:39.980
No wrong

01:36:47.340 --> 01:36:51.660
Get timed out for that mods. Where are you?

01:36:55.580 --> 01:36:57.580
Oh my god

01:36:58.140 --> 01:37:00.140
Go ahead and give me that twirl

01:37:00.700 --> 01:37:02.700
Oh, wait and press resume

01:37:03.500 --> 01:37:05.500
Oh, let me look at this

01:37:05.500 --> 01:37:10.140
Hi, oh, I tell you're fine. Tell me you can just sit back and relax baby girl. You're fine. Don't do anything. You're good

01:37:12.380 --> 01:37:15.020
Mods my vtuber stream mods gonna keep up

01:37:16.060 --> 01:37:21.340
Dude, I'm white. There's nothing to see anyway. Oh, no, that sounds like low self-esteem if I could volunteer a few more compliments

01:37:22.860 --> 01:37:25.260
I'm gonna go. I can still voluntarily. Bye

01:37:26.300 --> 01:37:27.980
Oh my god

01:37:27.980 --> 01:37:30.140
I got your tech. Sorry. I was caught up. What happened?

01:37:30.380 --> 01:37:36.140
I was in french too and called the weird kid rugrats fetish and got held after like rugrats to call it a cartoon

01:37:36.380 --> 01:37:38.380
Yeah, that's really good diss

01:37:38.380 --> 01:37:41.820
I know everyone laughed that you're made of both stay after for me apologize to him

01:37:41.820 --> 01:37:44.860
I can't talk but then after I was forced to say three nice things about him

01:37:46.140 --> 01:37:52.300
While he was there to his face. Yeah, talk about argus. Fuck. That's really cruel and unusual punishment. What did you even say?

01:37:53.020 --> 01:37:56.620
One of them was you don't smell that bad. Like I had no idea what to say

01:37:57.260 --> 01:38:01.740
Did he get turned on while you did it? Like think of how often a regular girl would say something nice to him

01:38:02.300 --> 01:38:06.860
I was trying to block that out when he gets home. He's going straight for your facebook summer photos

01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:11.340
Shit, and I forgot my password too. So what are you freaking out about micah's boyfriend?

01:38:11.660 --> 01:38:15.180
I thought you said the console that was horny. Oh, that's like every week. I'm already over that

01:38:15.180 --> 01:38:20.380
But no her boyfriend is out of his fucking mind. Well, yeah, he sent 11 dick pics for nothing back. No, shit

01:38:20.780 --> 01:38:24.540
No, he invited me to church this saturday. Isn't church on sunday?

01:38:25.020 --> 01:38:27.820
He's so involved the church. He goes more than sunday

01:38:28.460 --> 01:38:31.420
See a Mormon. Oh, he's one of those. Is it really surprising though?

01:38:33.100 --> 01:38:38.140
I didn't think a guy who cheats on his girlfriend and photographs his dick would have a strong relationship with jesus, I guess

01:38:38.940 --> 01:38:40.140
Oh, yeah, no, I've seen it

01:38:40.140 --> 01:38:44.380
I would so get off for your picture. So if it wasn't for my faith in god like, okay, thanks

01:38:44.380 --> 01:38:48.780
How'd you even get that far with the guy so religious? That's when I found out like what the fuck do I say?

01:38:48.780 --> 01:38:51.340
I didn't know what jesus was the escrow and titty pics

01:38:51.980 --> 01:38:56.780
Who even is jesus anymore? Anyway, some pedophile is fine to say that what?

01:38:57.740 --> 01:39:02.940
If you're a counselor, I don't find jesus. Yeah, jesus is a 15 year old girl for a juicy couture

01:39:06.860 --> 01:39:10.780
Are you gonna tell him no you just distract him? Hey, so I can't go to church tomorrow

01:39:10.780 --> 01:39:14.300
But you know what I want to do, you know what I want to do really fucking badly

01:39:16.620 --> 01:39:21.180
That was cool. How do you do that do 90% of dirty talk is just rhetorical questions

01:39:21.660 --> 01:39:22.940
She's not wrong

01:39:22.940 --> 01:39:29.260
So like I warned last week. Here's my casting for school's romeo and julia production. Let's see if romeo we have

01:39:29.820 --> 01:39:31.820
Wait, they made a play about romeo

01:39:32.060 --> 01:39:37.340
Oh, yeah, romeo's lead character. Isn't that mr. P's kid? Why do you think a little lot of it?

01:39:37.340 --> 01:39:40.940
No, not as a romeo mataku. It's shakespeare. We study this all month

01:39:41.660 --> 01:39:43.660
So it's not a little romeo and julia thong

01:39:44.460 --> 01:39:48.380
Yeah, what the fuck so the part playing the part romeo's hunter. Congratulations

01:39:48.940 --> 01:39:50.940

Yay, thanks guys and playing the role of juliette will be not me not me nicole. Oh, thank god. Seriously

01:40:04.700 --> 01:40:07.180
Yeah, you earned it. I know we got off a rocky star

01:40:07.180 --> 01:40:12.220
But you're on stage the synergy with hunter has really blown my mind. I can't think of anyone better for the part

01:40:12.780 --> 01:40:14.780
I'll text you about rehearsal later tonight, nicole

01:40:15.500 --> 01:40:21.900
Cool. Yeah, sure for a pairing like this communication is everything. Good luck you guys. You're gonna need it. Oh, you too

01:40:25.420 --> 01:40:27.420
He's laughing come on

No, I don't want to talk about the fucking what's who the fuck is this guy uh gamer brother

01:40:32.220 --> 01:40:36.460
And he doesn't even have a name who you're texting a guy. Whoa guys. He's getting serious

01:40:36.700 --> 01:40:40.540
I'm not having this conversation with you. Is he like asking for ask pictures or something?

01:40:40.620 --> 01:40:43.820
Can you not I can give you the aspects trump card if you want to know it

01:40:43.820 --> 01:40:46.860
Just so you see it come if you try to use it what trump card

01:40:47.340 --> 01:40:51.820
Oh, it's real simple. If a girl's holding out on me. I just make it about trust and how I'll kill myself

01:40:55.500 --> 01:40:58.620
There's no way that works. No, like it works every okay

01:40:58.620 --> 01:41:03.900
Well, not every time but like 10 of the time what girl would respond to emotionally enough to sue us all the guy begging to jack off

01:41:05.820 --> 01:41:07.820
My maros be like

01:41:08.780 --> 01:41:10.780
It's job

01:41:12.940 --> 01:41:20.620
Life's really good in the bathroom. Why are you coaching your sister? You're my brother. Yeah, what would you care about my quality of my aspects?

01:41:21.420 --> 01:41:23.420
Uh, no, it's uh, I gotta go

01:41:26.140 --> 01:41:30.860
I had to teach us what ancient Greece in school. Are you still there? Yeah, I'm still here's been 45 seconds asshole

01:41:31.340 --> 01:41:34.940
Haven't gone anywhere with this full body pick. Let's try idiot's way

01:41:34.940 --> 01:41:41.180
Do you not trust me? I just want to see you in all one picture because it'd be really really

01:41:43.340 --> 01:41:45.340
Really

01:41:45.340 --> 01:41:47.100
Really

01:41:47.100 --> 01:41:49.100
I got him got what you know what?

01:41:49.900 --> 01:41:55.340
Blink tickets are not even together anymore the pictures. Oh, right if revenge you're still plotting. How's that's going?

01:41:55.820 --> 01:41:57.820
Let's just say I have the key ingredient

01:41:59.820 --> 01:42:01.820
Suicidal

01:42:05.820 --> 01:42:10.460
Or or I see all the oji sons are the big bros. I see that many pictures the same thing over and over

01:42:10.940 --> 01:42:13.260
Loser and Nicole's bitch negan is a whore just cool. Shit

01:42:15.340 --> 01:42:20.060
My fire alarm is going off. Well, it's not mine, but someone in the building's fire alarm is going off. That's annoying

01:42:20.460 --> 01:42:22.460
Hopefully you might be able to hear it on the microphone

01:42:23.820 --> 01:42:26.140
Probably some loser smoking weed in my building

01:42:27.820 --> 01:42:33.100
It's like some ugly guy writing shit on himself not the visual of the rock control for a very awesome. Wait a second

01:42:35.420 --> 01:42:37.420
Oh

01:42:37.740 --> 01:42:41.740
No, there's not a fire people always open the doors so their apartments when they're cooking and let the smoke go

01:42:41.740 --> 01:42:43.740
And it sets their fire alarm off

01:42:45.180 --> 01:42:47.180
So she writes

01:42:48.860 --> 01:42:53.660
No, it's not like you got it's it's literally like it sounds like it's on a different floor

01:42:53.820 --> 01:42:55.820
It's or whatever. It's fine

01:42:56.220 --> 01:43:01.660
If it's not in my apartment and you'll trust me you'll hear when it's my apartment the alarms going off it is

01:43:02.540 --> 01:43:05.660
Your splittingly loud. It's terrible

01:43:07.420 --> 01:43:12.300
They are smoking weed and didn't offer a roofie bro. I don't think you know what that word means

01:43:15.340 --> 01:43:17.980
Um, but uh

01:43:19.900 --> 01:43:23.820
Writing writing we're writing my name on your body

01:43:24.540 --> 01:43:26.540
Ooh the control the control

01:43:27.100 --> 01:43:29.100
She be run save yourself

01:43:30.060 --> 01:43:32.700
No, this is the closest thing I've ever gotten to say

01:43:33.580 --> 01:43:36.140
It's a horrifying line in this game from oh my god

01:43:37.900 --> 01:43:41.820
Okay, that's what rapists say just so you know, I mean like I just but I'm a curl

01:43:41.820 --> 01:43:46.940
What am I gonna do guys fly off the handle for barely anything? Yeah guys not all not a lego

01:43:49.020 --> 01:43:51.900
Not saying that line exactly so now to the next step

01:43:52.380 --> 01:43:56.940
Are you gonna post the pictures online somewhere? No, I think I'm gonna hold on to these until the time is right

01:43:59.100 --> 01:44:01.100
And what time is that?

01:44:01.500 --> 01:44:05.740
Oh, you'll know I think everyone's gonna know. Oh my gosh. You can spread his news

01:44:07.580 --> 01:44:09.580
That's what

01:44:10.380 --> 01:44:14.540
We're on lesson five guys phones over outfit. It's good to get mega number check

01:44:15.500 --> 01:44:17.500
Make sure of a boyfriend with this weird dick out

01:44:19.420 --> 01:44:24.620
Hey, Nicole. Good luck tonight. Good luck to you too. Oh my god. Is she gonna put them up?

01:44:29.900 --> 01:44:31.900
That's so fucked

01:44:32.620 --> 01:44:37.980
Not her wink not the wink. We got two minutes into the first scene before mech and checked her phone

01:44:40.220 --> 01:44:41.260
Oh, okay

01:44:41.260 --> 01:44:42.460
That's so terrible

01:44:42.460 --> 01:44:48.140
What an amateur so she ran out on stage in the middle of romeo line laying out of control and just broke down crying in front of everybody

01:44:49.340 --> 01:44:51.100
Oh my god

01:44:51.100 --> 01:44:55.260
They were taking videos laughing. It was pretty fucking cool. He's just like shrugging

01:44:55.260 --> 01:44:59.820
She had to go to the ER for a panic attack and that was really fucking cool

01:45:00.220 --> 01:45:03.500
Jack I kept asking me why I had to go through rehearsing for a whole play even though I know

01:45:03.820 --> 01:45:08.060
I said like that's a good point. Well, I had to commit to it. Otherwise, she was gonna see when was up

01:45:09.100 --> 01:45:13.260
If I sent the picture as soon as I got it, she had the time to resolve everything before the play anyways

01:45:13.660 --> 01:45:15.660
There's no satisfaction in that

01:45:16.060 --> 01:45:18.780
See the movies where people kill someone for revenge, but it's like

01:45:19.260 --> 01:45:24.460
You're gonna let them off that easy. I didn't break a single law and this is like 10 times the payoff

01:45:24.700 --> 01:45:27.100
She's gonna be mentally fucked for the rest of her life over this

01:45:27.900 --> 01:45:31.900
And I just feel good about it. It's my face now Megan's gonna end up a cat lady. Hey

01:45:35.340 --> 01:45:39.980
This never happened to me. I just want to say that nobody does this to me

01:45:43.740 --> 01:45:45.260
No

01:45:45.260 --> 01:45:47.740
Called out smelling face. What new message?

01:45:49.500 --> 01:45:51.500
Oh interesting so

01:45:52.140 --> 01:45:55.900
It's just so I just like completed a thing

01:45:56.540 --> 01:46:00.060
No, it's not cheap you know, stop smiling at me

01:46:00.460 --> 01:46:02.460
Stop it

01:46:03.180 --> 01:46:07.900
Uh, let me see if the other game downloaded or showed it did not

01:59:02.940 --> 01:59:04.940
So

01:59:06.380 --> 01:59:10.380
Wait, did I add it? Okay, I did so what happened was

01:59:12.620 --> 01:59:15.580
I was playing ponies as a little girl does

01:59:16.380 --> 01:59:18.380
in elementary school

01:59:18.700 --> 01:59:20.700
and um

01:59:20.780 --> 01:59:22.780
Oh fuck

Oh, yeah, brother. Wait

01:59:37.020 --> 01:59:40.220
So as I'm saying so we're playing ponies um as one does

01:59:40.780 --> 01:59:46.140
And I'm I'm playing the pony and I'm on my hands and knees and I'm just like me, you know being a pony girl

01:59:47.900 --> 01:59:50.380
And some kid playing football

01:59:51.340 --> 01:59:57.340
Uh runs into me while trying to catch the ball. So I slammed my head on the pavement because he ran me down

01:59:58.220 --> 02:00:01.260
Um nice just literally laid there and screamed

02:00:03.580 --> 02:00:05.580
And and then the um

02:00:07.660 --> 02:00:09.660

02:00:31.040 --> 02:00:33.040
And so

02:00:33.120 --> 02:00:35.120
I was uh, no, this is what I was like

02:00:35.680 --> 02:00:43.440
Like seven or I don't know how old I was but like I have a you can't see it anymore because but I have the faintest scar

02:00:44.480 --> 02:00:47.920
Um right next to my eyebrow. You can't even tell especially if I wear makeup

02:00:48.560 --> 02:00:50.560
Um, you don't even notice it especially with my hair

02:00:51.760 --> 02:00:53.440
because I have um

02:00:53.440 --> 02:00:55.120
my bangs

02:00:55.120 --> 02:00:59.920
Like my little my little side my little bangs and the side bang part like literally how my model is right now

02:01:02.560 --> 02:01:08.640
Um, she was a child. No. Yeah, this was yesterday. I just was playing ponies with these kids and slam my head on some

02:01:09.200 --> 02:01:11.200
no, um

02:01:11.920 --> 02:01:16.080
That same year I bit piece of my tongue off, but it grew back. So it was fine

02:01:16.880 --> 02:01:18.880
It was good

02:01:19.120 --> 02:01:21.680
Um, you can tell no, you can't

02:01:21.680 --> 02:01:26.320
Uh, yeah, so I was sliding down a slide

02:01:27.600 --> 02:01:29.440
Um

02:01:29.440 --> 02:01:31.440
And you know like those bumpy slides

02:01:33.280 --> 02:01:36.160
I don't know. I'm just Wolverine. Um, I just grow stuff back

02:01:36.480 --> 02:01:39.520
You know those like little slides that have like little dips in them and like waves

02:01:39.600 --> 02:01:41.600
I'm literally moving my arm in a wave and you guys can't see

02:01:42.480 --> 02:01:46.160
And um, so when I was going down my knees were up. So my knees

02:01:46.800 --> 02:01:50.960
Um snapped up and hit myself in the jaw. So I bit off

02:01:51.440 --> 02:01:53.440
um, like a third of my tongue

02:01:55.920 --> 02:01:57.120
But uh

02:01:57.120 --> 02:02:00.080
And I was just sitting there screaming blood dripping out of my mouth

02:02:00.400 --> 02:02:02.400
And then a kid was like looking at me and he was just like

02:02:03.040 --> 02:02:06.640
And I was just like and we were just like screaming at each other and the the manager

02:02:07.120 --> 02:02:11.920
The teacher comes over and was like, oh, what the fuck did you do to yourself?

02:02:12.800 --> 02:02:14.800
Can you still eat out? Oh

02:02:16.560 --> 02:02:19.920
Just wait for the that audio that come out on preachy on just you wait

02:02:21.200 --> 02:02:24.400
Um, but no it into my tongue looks completely normal

02:02:26.720 --> 02:02:30.960
But yeah, I'm grateful and baffled you made it to this point. Um

02:02:33.040 --> 02:02:35.040
Don't lose your head now

02:02:36.560 --> 02:02:38.400
But uh

02:02:38.400 --> 02:02:44.960
I'm usually oh one time I was so in this at my school and my my my great school. Um

02:02:45.920 --> 02:02:46.720
I

02:02:46.720 --> 02:02:51.840
So they're these like wooden chairs that they didn't have like they weren't like the legs weren't separated

02:02:51.840 --> 02:02:55.440
They were just like kind of fused together and like this like cube square thing

02:02:55.760 --> 02:02:58.240
And so what they always told you not to do

02:02:59.040 --> 02:03:01.760
was run and push the

02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:05.840
Like don't run with the chairs because they just slide across the rug on the in the library

02:03:06.400 --> 02:03:08.080
So I was like

02:03:08.080 --> 02:03:13.120
Fuck my life and I ran with the chair and I pushed it and I flipped over the chair

02:03:13.600 --> 02:03:14.720
I

02:03:14.720 --> 02:03:16.720
banged my shin on the um

02:03:17.760 --> 02:03:19.760
edge of the chair cut up my shin

02:03:20.320 --> 02:03:22.320
uh got really bad rug burn

02:03:22.880 --> 02:03:24.480
and uh

02:03:24.480 --> 02:03:28.320
I still have that scar on my shin today. It's I'm and I was probably like

02:03:29.040 --> 02:03:32.560
I was super young. I was like in first grade. So I don't even know why I still have it

02:03:33.200 --> 02:03:36.240
Although it's like almost completely gone. Sorry. I'm looking down at it right now

02:03:38.320 --> 02:03:40.320
Um

02:03:40.720 --> 02:03:44.560
So I'm lucky because all this happened to you at the same time. You're super lucky because you didn't it was

02:03:45.040 --> 02:03:48.880
It wasn't even that like I didn't hit my head that bad. I like I've never like I've never

02:03:49.760 --> 02:03:51.760
I need something to knock on wood

02:03:52.400 --> 02:03:55.840
Um, I hope sorry boo me. He like sat up like someone's knocking at the door

02:03:56.480 --> 02:03:58.480
Pull down your pants. Let me knock on some wood

02:04:00.640 --> 02:04:03.520
I've never broken a bone on my body. So yeah

02:04:04.800 --> 02:04:06.800
I don't enjoy it

02:04:07.200 --> 02:04:08.800
I don't enjoy

02:04:08.960 --> 02:04:14.720
You like my jokes? I'm funny. I'm funny. Women aren't funny. I'm funny, bitch. Get it through your head

02:04:15.920 --> 02:04:17.920

02:04:18.720 --> 02:04:20.720
Okay, so I ordered my food

02:04:20.720 --> 02:04:22.720
Let's see what I'm gonna get here

02:04:23.520 --> 02:04:25.520
Okay, like 30 minutes

02:04:27.840 --> 02:04:29.200
Do do do do

02:04:29.200 --> 02:04:34.320
Wait, I didn't click download shit. Oh my god, this will take only a few minutes though. My internet's fast

02:04:34.720 --> 02:04:40.560
I need a chat for like two more minutes and I'll be fine. Funny money. Is this how you became a masochist? No

02:04:41.920 --> 02:04:43.120
No

02:04:43.120 --> 02:04:45.120
What are you talking about?

02:04:46.080 --> 02:04:50.080
I don't know. I don't I do not know what you're referring to. Okay

02:04:51.760 --> 02:04:58.000
And today you inflict pain on us. Yeah, you know what comes around goes around and comes around goes around and comes around again

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:01.360
And comes on you, you know, it happens. That's what happens

02:05:02.240 --> 02:05:04.240
blonde moment

02:05:04.480 --> 02:05:06.480
Oh, I'm so blonde. You don't even I

02:05:07.360 --> 02:05:11.120
I literally I don't think it's when they say like when you're blonde

02:05:12.160 --> 02:05:16.160
Or if you dye your hair blonde like the dyes in your head or like when you're blonde

02:05:16.720 --> 02:05:20.800
Uh, you're just really yeah, I know it's a fact as someone whose best friend was blonde and I was blonde

02:05:21.920 --> 02:05:25.600
We were all blonde. We were just dumb blondes. Like I was in my bimbo era

02:05:26.240 --> 02:05:28.240
with my blonde hair

02:05:28.560 --> 02:05:30.560
Switch to almastery

02:05:30.560 --> 02:05:34.800
Jamie, why aren't you dominant? What do you want me to know? I'm just a loser. I'm a dork

02:05:35.200 --> 02:05:37.920
But you're more of a loser in a dork. So how does that make you feel? Hmm?

02:05:38.800 --> 02:05:40.800
The game's ready to play only took me a minute

02:05:42.080 --> 02:05:44.080
You really are jacka

02:05:44.080 --> 02:05:46.080
Stop it. I'm not jacka

02:05:50.960 --> 02:05:52.960
All right

02:05:53.360 --> 02:05:55.360
Oh

02:05:59.520 --> 02:06:01.920
Let's go why am I so fucking huge?

02:06:08.240 --> 02:06:13.520
Yee, whoa, why I don't like how this perspective is go outside. Does that just quit the game?

02:06:14.560 --> 02:06:16.560
All right, let's go to options

02:06:16.640 --> 02:06:23.600
Okay, so the really I think the biggest difference was everything was voiced wasn't it

02:06:24.320 --> 02:06:28.960
Make no mistake. So now I can properly voice stuff. I'm a sociopath

02:06:31.360 --> 02:06:33.360
You might want to show the game. Oh fuck

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:39.360
I grew up all over coastal america house after house after restraining order

02:06:39.920 --> 02:06:41.920
Everything just kind of blends in

02:06:42.880 --> 02:06:44.880
I

02:06:56.160 --> 02:06:59.280
Would you believe me if I told you that I've been sure seven years

02:07:04.080 --> 02:07:08.160
Oh, no, why am I like this?

02:07:08.800 --> 02:07:13.920
A month into high school. So the why is meeting on you social leverage was why do you guys follow me?

02:07:15.680 --> 02:07:22.400
Or other v-tubers as this like as stuffed it like to be honest like am I am I really the ultimate girl failure out here?

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:27.280
I can't be right. They're like there has to be someone out there. That's worse than I am

02:07:28.080 --> 02:07:30.080
right

02:07:30.560 --> 02:07:32.560
Please

02:07:33.520 --> 02:07:35.520

02:07:41.840 --> 02:07:43.840
Jesus Christ

02:07:43.840 --> 02:07:48.560
Anyway, so mom was crying packing up the moving boxes. And that's when she told me

02:07:49.920 --> 02:07:55.120
And I just got settled. I said, fuck you. I'm living with dad. It's just a narrow way down

02:07:55.280 --> 02:08:01.600
I put the boxes down and go over knock on the door and boom a gunshot my second christmas killed himself

02:08:01.920 --> 02:08:06.720
I walked in floor look like a whole lot to be okay. Hi. Dakota. Oh, I want to I want

02:08:07.200 --> 02:08:10.400
I so I followed her the other day and like mind you. I've also like I've

02:08:11.120 --> 02:08:15.520
Always been up to date with a lot of agency v-tubers in my past life. I'm Nicole, by the way

02:08:15.760 --> 02:08:17.760
And I was

02:08:18.080 --> 02:08:19.360
um

02:08:19.360 --> 02:08:23.120
I remembered I'm like hi like we need a collab

02:08:23.920 --> 02:08:24.880

02:08:24.880 --> 02:08:26.880
It would be hilarious as fuck if we collab

02:08:27.520 --> 02:08:28.800
again

02:08:28.880 --> 02:08:34.240
Uh, the power of not being called by youtube. Well, no, no, it was 6k on um on twitter

02:08:35.120 --> 02:08:39.840
Although I don't yeah, we haven't been called. I think I think we're good

02:08:40.400 --> 02:08:44.880
I'm crossing. I'm knocking on wood again. Pull down your pants. Um

02:08:46.240 --> 02:08:48.720
So hopefully we don't get called again because it doesn't seem like we are

02:08:52.640 --> 02:08:54.640
Anyways, so I started blasting

02:08:54.640 --> 02:08:56.640
class this year with mr. Burlodey

02:08:56.720 --> 02:09:00.160
Wait, no. Oh my god, that is so funny. What the heck?

02:09:00.240 --> 02:09:02.880
They are never funny. It's like the girls just laugh to avoid

02:09:02.880 --> 02:09:04.880
Okay, hold on. Let me restart this

02:09:16.480 --> 02:09:21.760
Why does the game keep disappearing? Okay, there we go. I think when I click off well

02:09:22.720 --> 02:09:24.720
Jesus Christ

02:09:31.280 --> 02:09:35.440
See the game is there house after house after restraining order

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:42.240
Everything just kind of blends in if the divorce rate is 5050. My mom landed on tails like eight times. Jesus christ

02:09:44.240 --> 02:09:50.800
Mom gets around different houses and attended six different school districts. We stay technically disabled. Yeah

02:09:51.760 --> 02:09:57.360
And see graduation song. Yeah, I can't relate but then one year all of that almost changed

02:09:57.760 --> 02:10:02.400
For the first time ever I found myself in a school for two consecutive years going on three

02:10:02.640 --> 02:10:09.440
Oh, okay started turning pretty a month into high school. So the dance got big titties social leverage was really awesome

02:10:09.840 --> 02:10:12.480
The popular girls would talk to me all the time. I don't know is

02:10:12.960 --> 02:10:16.720
They were stupid. Is jecca or nicole the literally me

02:10:17.360 --> 02:10:21.440
Because I don't have like a literally me character like she oh, she's literally me and when I think about it

02:10:21.920 --> 02:10:24.640
All the thinking I've ever done was when I was alone

02:10:25.200 --> 02:10:28.000
I was nice about it and thought I'd always be nice about it

02:10:28.480 --> 02:10:31.120
Finally in one place to build a steady reputation

02:10:32.080 --> 02:10:38.240
And then life said fuck that my piece of shit gamer brother got us evicted for pirating breakbeat mixtapes

02:10:38.480 --> 02:10:45.040
It's not even good music. Anyway, so mom was crying packing up the movie. Why does it sound like like spoken words?

02:10:46.400 --> 02:10:51.200
And I just got settled. I said, fuck you. I'm living with dad. He's just a neighborhood down

02:10:51.600 --> 02:10:53.600
This is like so intense

02:11:00.640 --> 02:11:02.640
Oh, so she literally did

02:11:03.760 --> 02:11:09.440
Walk into her dad killing himself. I mean whatever he's asking for to know

02:11:11.120 --> 02:11:13.120
No

02:11:16.800 --> 02:11:18.800
That's so fucked

02:11:22.160 --> 02:11:27.840

02:11:29.040 --> 02:11:32.720

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000

02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:43.680
Oh, this is the year before hey, so for the senior prank

02:11:45.840 --> 02:11:51.120
Why does it keep going this year? Okay, park their cars or we don't usually park them

02:11:52.160 --> 02:11:54.160
I don't have a choice

02:12:03.840 --> 02:12:05.840
Yep, yeah, that's usually how it is

02:12:13.920 --> 02:12:15.920
Okay, now it'll pause. Okay

02:12:16.960 --> 02:12:18.960
Can I

02:12:19.840 --> 02:12:21.840

02:12:22.560 --> 02:12:25.760
Let me how when do I get to the part where I do the readings myself?

Should I do the school tour or should I just go to class or because I don't feel like I cut class in like the last one so

02:13:04.400 --> 02:13:06.400

02:14:05.840 --> 02:14:07.840
Huh, I guess

02:14:08.320 --> 02:14:13.600
Huh, not a big talker. Are you I don't know you are you just chill me with everyone you meet

02:14:14.720 --> 02:14:19.280
Not everyone, but if they look like the type to like anime then may as well, right

02:14:20.080 --> 02:14:25.760
Packs away. I'm sorry. I look like I like anime. No, that's a good thing. It means you're cool and different

02:14:27.040 --> 02:14:31.360
In 300 pounds. What was that? Oh, nothing. I was just converting british currency in my head

02:14:31.920 --> 02:14:38.160
Cool see, um, well the teacher said I'm jeffrey the teacher the teacher said I'm jeffrey. So that's my name

02:14:39.760 --> 02:14:42.800
Uh, this freak is not getting my name

02:14:44.080 --> 02:14:46.800
So what so you'll be up on my space or something? No, thanks

02:14:47.280 --> 02:14:51.520
Well, we're gonna get to know each other anyway, right? Probably not probably after this week

02:14:51.520 --> 02:14:56.960
We won't even talk anymore. I moved to a lot of different schools. So I'm fully aware using the new kid grace period

02:14:58.320 --> 02:14:59.920
Wait, what?

02:14:59.920 --> 02:15:01.920
What's new kid grace period?

02:15:01.920 --> 02:15:06.800
Uh, it's where the outcast squeeze all the interaction they can out of new kids way above their social status

02:15:07.040 --> 02:15:08.080
That's so true, though

02:15:08.080 --> 02:15:13.920
When the new kids get here, it's awkward. They don't know who's who they'll humor any conversation or friendship until they find the people in their social level

02:15:15.200 --> 02:15:19.360
How do you know i'm not in your social level fucking look at you. Listen to how you talk

02:15:19.520 --> 02:15:22.800
How do I know i'm not shut the fuck up. Hey, I didn't do anything

02:15:23.200 --> 02:15:26.800
I know that's what you will do. I've had my ear talked off about comics laser swords

02:15:27.120 --> 02:15:30.640
Larring the age of consents ninja hand signs. I just saw that weird shit

02:15:32.080 --> 02:15:35.040
You know, the other pretty girls here a lot nicer than you are

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
They talk to you because it's funny get a clue

02:15:38.720 --> 02:15:42.000
Yeah, a lot of people say i'm funny. Oh, you're funny. Tell me a joke

02:15:43.040 --> 02:15:46.720
Oh, well, it's more like in the moment. You kind of had to be there kind of funny

02:15:48.640 --> 02:15:50.000
Okay, fuck

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.160
Okay, jeffrey. You want me to save your ears of guessing?

02:15:52.720 --> 02:15:58.480
Yeah, sure how they're not laughing at you with you. They're laughing at you because you'll they'll never have sex with you

02:15:59.120 --> 02:16:03.280
Ah, I got you there. A lot of the girls here said they're saving their subs themselves for me

02:16:04.320 --> 02:16:09.280
Christ they make it that obvious here. Yeah, they're kind of easy if you ask me know it

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
Believe what you want. I'm going to lunch

02:16:14.640 --> 02:16:19.440
Oh, you feel for jeffrey bless your soul bless your sweetheart. I'm funny. I know I am

02:16:22.320 --> 02:16:28.480
God the food here is tragic. Even the air has preservatives fucking tell me about it. So I pack. Oh, sorry. I didn't see you

02:16:28.880 --> 02:16:31.680
That's okay. You can stay here. I'm jacka. Where are you from from?

02:16:32.400 --> 02:16:35.440
Uh chemistry, I think I don't know. I don't really do anything

02:16:36.480 --> 02:16:40.080
Uh, that sucks. Yeah, you have to like wash acid off you before you can touch your food

02:16:40.640 --> 02:16:45.600
I'm not eating it anyway. The guy had to sit next to me scared my appetite away pretty much just me away in general

02:16:47.760 --> 02:16:49.760
Who was it? Do you know?

02:16:49.840 --> 02:16:51.440
um jeffrey

02:16:51.440 --> 02:16:53.440
Oh, yeah, he's a fun one

02:16:53.760 --> 02:16:56.160
But he's like so overly chummy. That's fun to you

02:16:56.880 --> 02:17:01.760
No, like fun the fuck with him. Da freshman year every girl put love notes in his locker, right?

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:05.680
So he went up to some of the girl's boyfriends like, uh, she's in love with me now

02:17:06.160 --> 02:17:08.160
Oh my god, that is funny

02:17:08.560 --> 02:17:12.000
But because they're all like 14 three guys just beat the shit out of them for it

02:17:12.240 --> 02:17:14.480
Now we all these stupid anti-bullying rules

02:17:15.280 --> 02:17:20.880
I never got how they could like enforce that. It's baby simple. Baby simple. Just be hot and sociable

02:17:21.600 --> 02:17:23.600
Fucking accurate. I'm Nicole by the way

02:17:24.960 --> 02:17:26.960
Well, I'll see you around Nicole

02:17:30.880 --> 02:17:34.800
Nicole you ready for day two? Is someone gonna kill me day two? If so, absolutely

02:17:35.680 --> 02:17:37.360
Why what happened?

02:17:37.360 --> 02:17:41.440
Just like waking up in general hurts and I got a deal with my brother who's still up from the night before I'm from eating

02:17:41.440 --> 02:17:43.440
a family box of anything

02:17:44.960 --> 02:17:47.360
He can eat family size meals. How old is he?

02:17:48.160 --> 02:17:50.400
Like 26. He just reloads off my mom

02:17:51.680 --> 02:17:57.280
I mean, we kind of reload too, but we're 16. It's cool when we do it. Exactly. I have to tell him when I'm woken up by

02:17:57.360 --> 02:17:59.360
loud chewing noises

02:17:59.760 --> 02:18:01.280
Is he fat?

02:18:01.280 --> 02:18:03.440
Do you know what x bodybuilder fat is?

02:18:04.160 --> 02:18:07.360
Yeah, I kind of know what that looks like. Well, he's an obese monster

02:18:07.520 --> 02:18:13.200
I was just curious if anyone else knew that body body filter body filter phrase. He's not that good to know

02:18:13.440 --> 02:18:17.520
Hey, let's gossip more at lunch. I gotta get to class dude. Fuck class. Just skip with me

02:18:17.760 --> 02:18:22.400
I told you yesterday I never skip anymore and my mom's gonna start giving me disciplinary tattoos

02:18:22.880 --> 02:18:28.480
How does that even work? What's she write on you? It'd be some weird shit. Like I love school on my fingers

02:18:29.280 --> 02:18:31.280
Isn't that like abusive?

02:18:31.920 --> 02:18:34.400
She's the only mom I've ever had. How the fuck should I know?

02:18:35.600 --> 02:18:36.800
Huh

02:18:36.800 --> 02:18:38.800
So are you headed?

02:18:39.200 --> 02:18:40.000
Oh

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
gym class or photography

02:18:42.640 --> 02:18:45.680
Nicole it goes in high school. Which was cruel as fuck. I'm not gonna lie

02:18:46.480 --> 02:18:48.720
I was one of those fucking weird kids like

02:18:50.640 --> 02:18:56.640
Because you know, I rolled up. I liked anime drew on my notebooks drew like anime shit and um

02:18:58.160 --> 02:19:05.280
Uh, I remember I got bullied for being a lesbian just because I hung out with the group of girls

02:19:05.520 --> 02:19:08.640
And I was which doesn't make any sense because I'm like you hang out with girls, too

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:15.280
Um, and I was also like I looked like a fucking rat. I looked like I looked like ass now

02:19:15.360 --> 02:19:20.480
I'm hot as fuck, but Jesus christ. So yeah, like kids kids are harsh

02:19:20.960 --> 02:19:24.640
I was I was definitely the female Jeffrey. I'm not gonna lie. Um

02:19:25.280 --> 02:19:29.680
Don't girls usually hang out in packs. You're right. I was also first read books. I was reading books

02:19:29.760 --> 02:19:31.760
I was so socially awkward

02:19:31.840 --> 02:19:33.840
I couldn't talk to anybody. Um

02:19:34.320 --> 02:19:37.360
I was definitely like the follower in the friend group like I would just sit there

02:19:37.440 --> 02:19:39.120
Just sit with the girls and be like

02:19:39.120 --> 02:19:41.120
Yay, I'm

02:19:41.120 --> 02:19:43.280
I'm here. Um, I remember

02:19:45.680 --> 02:19:48.720
My mom like really hated these girls. I like and when I say friends

02:19:48.800 --> 02:19:54.160
I say really loosely because um, I was friends with like loosely with these mean girls

02:19:54.240 --> 02:19:58.880
And I was definitely the friend they kept around like, you know how there's always like that one person in the friend group

02:19:59.680 --> 02:20:01.680
um

02:20:01.680 --> 02:20:06.880
They keep around just to like shit on like there's always that one person. I was that person

02:20:07.680 --> 02:20:11.440
I was definitely that fucking person. Yeah, you can always tell people who peaked in high school

02:20:11.440 --> 02:20:15.440
Yeah, I see these people because like I still live where I grew up and I'm just like, oh, wow

02:20:16.400 --> 02:20:18.640
You work at an ice cream stand

02:20:20.160 --> 02:20:23.120
They don't know I'm a famous niche internet celebrity and vtuber

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
The actual lesbian characters in the read up

02:20:32.160 --> 02:20:35.680
Yeah, now I'm like I have like when you're an adult you like

02:20:36.640 --> 02:20:42.080
Sometimes like, you know, I took I still took a lot of work. You kind of build up that confidence to

02:20:43.280 --> 02:20:45.920
Really hang out with people that are your friends and that you like

02:20:46.560 --> 02:20:48.720
Um, why am I so small in the corner?

02:20:51.920 --> 02:20:53.920
There you go

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:58.000
Yeah, but I took a lot of effort to be as the people are like, oh

02:20:58.880 --> 02:21:04.400
She be you're introverted and you couldn't even order a starbucks coffee at age 18 and I'm like, yeah

02:21:05.200 --> 02:21:11.040
Literally working my retail job forced me to come out of my shell and also give me a wake-up call because I was so

02:21:11.440 --> 02:21:13.440
severely sheltered being a religious

02:21:13.520 --> 02:21:15.520

02:21:16.800 --> 02:21:22.160
You got a meme you got to see the meme female bullying soft pictures. Oh, no, I have seen those. They are really funny

02:21:23.120 --> 02:21:25.120

Okay, do I want to hang out should we hang out with him? I'm gonna I'm gonna have you guys help me with this one

02:26:45.520 --> 02:26:47.520
Should he does he have no chance?

02:26:47.840 --> 02:26:50.640
Because I'm gonna play through stuff. I'm not gonna save and go back because that's stupid

02:26:51.840 --> 02:26:53.840
Kyler, please I'm begging

02:26:54.160 --> 02:26:56.160
Nope. No, okay. Let's put it to a vote. Let's put it to a vote

02:27:00.960 --> 02:27:02.960
Kyler yes or no

02:27:05.120 --> 02:27:07.120
I'm gonna wait for that. I'm gonna look at see where my food is

02:27:08.080 --> 02:27:10.080
Oh, it's heading to me

02:27:13.360 --> 02:27:16.080
Oh, it's all the way it'll be here in 10 minutes

02:27:20.160 --> 02:27:26.160
We stay indecisive he's the stupidest character in game. That's kind of funny grill him

02:27:27.360 --> 02:27:30.320
Would you order? Um, I'll tell you when it gets here

02:27:30.320 --> 02:27:32.320
Oh

02:27:35.920 --> 02:27:39.600
My tummy is like I've literally only had applesauce. What the fuck is wrong with me?

02:27:40.880 --> 02:27:46.000
Before you dig in snap a photo of your food. No, I'm fucking eating that shit. You kidding me door ash. I got it here

02:27:47.120 --> 02:27:49.520
Dumb golden retriever type energy she be for

02:27:51.120 --> 02:27:55.920
Can we put the gym teacher six feet under in facts? That's so gross for real

02:27:56.720 --> 02:28:01.440
No, I'm gnomes. No, okay. Dipsha has no chance with me

02:28:07.120 --> 02:28:08.560
Good night

02:28:08.560 --> 02:28:11.200
Are you seriously asking me out while taking dodgeball seriously?

02:28:11.920 --> 02:28:16.160
No, I mean, well, kind of it could just be sex. We don't need like a whole relationship

02:28:17.520 --> 02:28:22.960
Oh, sorry. I don't know the politically correct way of asking this, but are you actually retarded?

02:28:23.680 --> 02:28:29.040
I don't know who told you but when I got tested that was supposed to be a secret fucking trolley. Can't keep us

02:28:32.080 --> 02:28:34.080
Don't clip it

02:28:34.960 --> 02:28:36.960
Don't

02:28:37.520 --> 02:28:40.320
Your quintessential dipshit don't fucking do it

02:28:45.680 --> 02:28:47.680
If you do it, I'm ending the stream right now

02:28:49.520 --> 02:28:51.520
I'm not even fucking with you

02:28:52.960 --> 02:28:54.960
I

02:28:56.480 --> 02:28:58.480
I'm ending it

02:28:58.800 --> 02:29:00.800
Ended by everybody

02:29:01.440 --> 02:29:03.200
streams done

02:29:03.200 --> 02:29:04.720
All right

02:29:04.720 --> 02:29:07.840
I'll see you guys around. It's been great. I'm gonna go eat some food

02:29:08.800 --> 02:29:10.800
Uh, let's see

02:29:16.720 --> 02:29:18.720
Oh, no, fuck you guys I'll play

02:29:19.680 --> 02:29:21.680
I

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:23.200
Hate all of you

02:29:23.200 --> 02:29:27.200
Quinn, uh, I don't know what the fuck that means, but I'm gonna kick your ass. I'm a girl. Don't fucking hurt me

02:29:28.320 --> 02:29:30.080
Actually, no

02:29:30.080 --> 02:29:32.800
Honestly, if I if I hit a guy, I'd totally expect him to hit me back

02:29:33.760 --> 02:29:35.760
I beat the shit out of my mom

02:29:35.760 --> 02:29:39.600
Get the nerd in on it. I feel like that won't matter. I don't think he'll let me

02:29:41.120 --> 02:29:45.040
Let him simmer down. I feel like yeah, because I was mean to him. He won't do anything for me

02:29:46.160 --> 02:29:48.160
Let's get a fucking beat up

02:29:49.680 --> 02:29:53.200
I would I would if I if I got I would totally get the shit over a guy though

02:29:54.880 --> 02:29:56.880
I'm a strong bitch

02:29:58.080 --> 02:30:02.720
Okay, whatever you're the only party who cares in this anyway. Yeah, don't test me again. There's gonna be trouble now

02:30:02.720 --> 02:30:04.720
I got balls to dodge

02:30:06.800 --> 02:30:08.960
Why does everyone in the closet want to kill me?

02:30:11.680 --> 02:30:13.200
What's that

02:30:13.200 --> 02:30:15.280
What's what the gym clothes

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:20.480
Oh, yeah, the heat's cranked way too high here. So I just left class in this. I can finally breathe, you know

02:30:22.080 --> 02:30:25.360
Okay, well, you're the first girl I've ever met who isn't cold 24 seven

02:30:26.400 --> 02:30:28.400
Yep, not cold at all

02:30:29.120 --> 02:30:30.640
I am actually

02:30:30.640 --> 02:30:35.840
Canonically, I'm cold 24 seven. Um, I don't my customers when I worked in sales

02:30:36.880 --> 02:30:40.880
Tell me I probably have what is it called reinoids syndrome or renaud syndrome

02:30:41.600 --> 02:30:43.600
Because my fingers turn white

02:30:43.600 --> 02:30:45.600
When I'm really cold

02:30:46.240 --> 02:30:49.840
And I lose a feeling in my lens. Well, mostly my fingies

02:30:50.560 --> 02:30:52.560
He he

02:30:52.960 --> 02:30:54.960
He he who who

02:30:55.920 --> 02:30:57.920
Ho ho ho he he

02:30:58.160 --> 02:31:00.160
Hold on. Let me see where my food is at

02:31:01.440 --> 02:31:03.440
Oh my god, please

02:31:07.840 --> 02:31:09.840
Oh, they're so close

02:31:13.840 --> 02:31:16.720
Don't click what don't be an asshole

02:31:25.440 --> 02:31:27.440
That will

02:31:28.720 --> 02:31:30.720
She be you can't eat on stream. Fuck it. We ball

02:31:33.200 --> 02:31:36.720
A skip's changing to get out what let's throw it away. What about you?

02:31:36.880 --> 02:31:38.880
He asked me out and I'm pretty clearly told him to screw off

02:31:39.040 --> 02:31:41.920
It's like white guys who like running can't take no for an answer

02:31:42.160 --> 02:31:48.800
I wish I had like five percent of your confidence. How's that confidence blatantly telling some scary dude to get lost?

02:31:48.960 --> 02:31:50.960
I could never do that

02:31:51.040 --> 02:31:53.920
It's not that I'm confident. I'm just too lazy to give a shit facts

02:31:55.600 --> 02:31:57.120
True

02:31:57.120 --> 02:31:59.120
It's either I'm too lazy or I'm too crazy

02:31:59.760 --> 02:32:01.760
Months later

02:32:04.480 --> 02:32:08.960
So it's been a few months since we moved to school going like academically or socially

02:32:09.120 --> 02:32:14.400
Everything anything honestly it's going pretty good

02:32:15.920 --> 02:32:18.560
It looks like she didn't have any arms for a second because

02:32:19.440 --> 02:32:20.480
the

02:32:20.480 --> 02:32:22.480
color of the background

02:32:22.880 --> 02:32:24.880
Nothing's a burden

02:32:25.760 --> 02:32:31.600
Yeah, I'll turn on the the audio like the voice acting stuff when um my food gets here like I'll put it like this

02:32:32.160 --> 02:32:34.880
Anytime I got asked for my company asked me out or asked or anything

02:32:35.440 --> 02:32:38.800
And I make decisions entirely for myself not concerned with their feelings. There's no stress

02:32:39.920 --> 02:32:41.920
Damn, she's a bad bitch

02:32:42.480 --> 02:32:44.480
Honey, that sounds a little mean-spirited. Don't you think?

02:32:45.920 --> 02:32:48.640
Yeah, well, what's the alternative of being used to do shit people

02:32:48.800 --> 02:32:53.440
Especially men are for the perfect pawns when you don't give a fuck about them or whatever they want

02:32:57.440 --> 02:32:59.440
I won't argue as

02:33:01.680 --> 02:33:07.280
Half the all my viewers leave because they hear me say that they're just like what she be

02:33:09.920 --> 02:33:14.640
Because there's feminism you vote and work. Okay, well fuck feminism. I'm starting necolism

02:33:15.200 --> 02:33:19.600
Necolism. Yeah, the main concept is girls are moving all emotional attachment from anyone

02:33:20.720 --> 02:33:23.600
Oh, I'm sure you'll meet a nice boy soon. You'll be all over this

02:33:24.240 --> 02:33:29.120
How can I meet a nice boy when all men are just rapists and pedophiles is fucking kids nice mom?

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000
This conversation's over

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:36.000
Oh

02:33:36.080 --> 02:33:39.360
Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god

02:33:41.040 --> 02:33:43.040
Hold on. Let me pause. Who the fuck is this guy?

02:33:46.160 --> 02:33:52.080
Okay, my food's here. Let me run. I'm gonna be our be real quick. Go get it. Um and come back

02:33:54.640 --> 02:33:56.640
Let me just stretch

02:33:57.200 --> 02:33:59.200
E

02:34:04.640 --> 02:34:08.240
All right, see you in a moment love

02:34:26.640 --> 02:34:28.640
You

02:34:56.640 --> 02:34:58.640
You

02:35:26.640 --> 02:35:28.640
You

02:35:56.640 --> 02:35:58.640
You

02:36:26.640 --> 02:36:28.640
You

02:36:56.640 --> 02:36:58.640
You

02:37:26.640 --> 02:37:28.640
You

02:37:56.640 --> 02:37:58.640
You

02:38:26.640 --> 02:38:28.640
You

02:38:56.640 --> 02:38:58.640
You

02:39:26.640 --> 02:39:28.640
You

02:39:28.640 --> 02:39:30.640
You

02:39:54.560 --> 02:39:56.560
Okay

02:39:58.640 --> 02:40:00.640
Uh

02:40:12.640 --> 02:40:17.760
So, you know how door dash like I'm like if someone doesn't speak English usually like auto translate

02:40:17.760 --> 02:40:21.360
So they do this Spanish and so I think my person was Spanish and they just

02:40:22.720 --> 02:40:24.720
They just said here I am

02:40:25.360 --> 02:40:27.360
And I'm like, okay

02:40:28.320 --> 02:40:35.760
And then I was gonna go to the elevator to go downstairs and then he just shows up. He's like here I am and I'm like

02:40:41.520 --> 02:40:43.520
And it was funny he looked at me he was like, oh

02:40:43.920 --> 02:40:45.920
Because I look like a rat right now

02:40:46.240 --> 02:40:50.560
I look like shit. I'm wearing just wearing a pair of fucking booty shorts and a sweatshirt

02:40:51.120 --> 02:40:53.120
My hair's a mess. I still haven't showered

02:40:53.600 --> 02:40:55.600
Probably shower after this

02:40:58.320 --> 02:41:00.320
Okay, let me move my keyboard

02:41:05.760 --> 02:41:12.240
Gracias mi amor. Yeah. Hello me. I'm me. I'm your mi amor. There's no ice in here

02:41:14.720 --> 02:41:16.560
I'm probably eliminated and put no ice in it

02:41:18.480 --> 02:41:20.480
Shower stream one. I've already done that

02:41:21.360 --> 02:41:24.160
Not like in a stream, but I did record myself in the shower

02:41:24.400 --> 02:41:26.400
Okay

02:41:26.960 --> 02:41:28.960
I've actually already forgot what I got

02:41:29.760 --> 02:41:31.760
I got

02:41:31.840 --> 02:41:34.880
Sandwich so it's a mac and cheese chicken sandwich

02:41:36.480 --> 02:41:43.440
Then I got what is this? Oh, it's sauce boomie. Can you fuck off dude? You don't have boomie is

02:41:44.640 --> 02:41:49.200
One of those cats that oh, I need to lock my door. What is this? Oh, it's marinara sauce

02:41:50.560 --> 02:41:52.560
um

02:41:52.960 --> 02:41:55.460
Boomie's one of those cats that just like has to be a part of everything

02:42:03.920 --> 02:42:05.920
Door locks

02:42:12.480 --> 02:42:14.480
And then I also got some

02:42:16.960 --> 02:42:19.200
Sammy spicy no, it's like kind of spicy

02:42:20.160 --> 02:42:22.640
It's not this it's not the spicy one. It's the mac and cheese

02:42:24.240 --> 02:42:26.240
What is this?

02:42:26.240 --> 02:42:29.040
Oh, this is I'm definitely gonna have a lot of leftovers. Um

02:42:30.240 --> 02:42:32.240
It's like mozzarella sticks

02:42:33.600 --> 02:42:35.600
But they're made with ontons

02:42:36.560 --> 02:42:38.560
Oh

02:42:42.800 --> 02:42:44.800
Blooming I'm gonna fight you

02:42:51.600 --> 02:42:55.760
And then I have some tater tots with parmesan

02:43:01.760 --> 02:43:03.760
One bite

02:43:06.560 --> 02:43:11.200
Boomi's literally looking at me and looking at his lips. Boomi likes french fries. He steals french fries from me

02:43:27.840 --> 02:43:31.760
There was no three, what are you talking about? I should probably have a napkin here

02:43:32.720 --> 02:43:35.680
Cause I'm probably gonna spill something in myself. Oh, I'll just use this blanket

02:43:38.240 --> 02:43:40.240
This is a towel, right blanket

02:43:42.960 --> 02:43:47.840
If three gang ever emerges, what is this random role play going on?

02:43:53.440 --> 02:43:55.440
Mmm, that's so good

02:44:02.640 --> 02:44:06.800
I'm probably going to have the worst stomach ache later from all this cheese

02:44:18.400 --> 02:44:20.400
Cute bunny, hello

02:44:20.400 --> 02:44:36.400
Hey guys having fun rp-ing in the chat game of thrones house one and house two and the unknown house house three

02:44:41.440 --> 02:44:43.840
I have lactate. I just didn't take any because I'm dumb

02:44:44.240 --> 02:44:51.120
Are you lactose intolerance? Yeah

02:44:57.280 --> 02:45:03.920
Well, this is the the mozzarella stick. I'll take a bite of the um, I'll take a picture of the sandwich so you guys can see what I'm eating

02:45:07.600 --> 02:45:09.200
Wait

02:45:09.200 --> 02:45:12.800
Now my phone is using to being used to record. Never mind. You can't see

02:45:14.080 --> 02:45:16.080
I

02:45:21.520 --> 02:45:25.120
I get diarrhea when I drink chocolate milk nobody asked

02:45:28.160 --> 02:45:31.040
But only chocolate milk. I don't think you should drink chocolate milk then bro

02:45:36.240 --> 02:45:41.040
I I'm not the one who lactates that is a zura

02:45:44.800 --> 02:45:47.200
Lactosians, what are you talking about?

02:45:52.160 --> 02:45:55.600
Hope you'll be all right after all the cheese you're consuming. I'll probably die later

02:45:56.080 --> 02:45:58.080
I'm probably fight for my life on the toilet later. No worries

02:46:02.560 --> 02:46:04.560
You could at least try

02:46:05.440 --> 02:46:06.640
What?

02:46:06.640 --> 02:46:10.800
What's going on here? That's what I'm asking. That's what I'm asking bro. What is going on here?

02:46:11.360 --> 02:46:14.720
She's 56. Can she still lactate? Yep

02:46:17.360 --> 02:46:20.800
Okay, let me take a bite of the sandwich. Oh my god, it looks so fucking good

02:46:32.160 --> 02:46:37.280
Oh my god, oh the spicy fuck. Oh no. Yeah, I'm not gonna have a fun time later

02:46:40.800 --> 02:46:42.800
I

02:46:56.480 --> 02:46:58.480
Looks so funny when I eat food

02:46:58.640 --> 02:47:00.640
When I drink something

02:47:00.640 --> 02:47:03.760
Um, oh my god, spicy. No, I forgot it was spicy

02:47:04.960 --> 02:47:08.800
So what it is it's a nap. Yeah, just say it's a garlic mac and cheese

02:47:09.760 --> 02:47:11.760
Um

02:47:12.720 --> 02:47:18.240
On it like a on a chicken fried chicken sandwich

02:47:21.040 --> 02:47:23.040
Pretty bomb

02:47:26.400 --> 02:47:33.040
No two one but one also technically one because two was spicy and I forgot it was

02:47:38.880 --> 02:47:46.160
Well, it's just a bun, you know, it's just a bun then the fried chicken then a little bit of mac and cheese and then that

02:47:48.400 --> 02:47:50.400
So was the hidden third option

02:47:52.880 --> 02:47:55.520
I need a bar. Oh my god, boomi. What are you doing?

02:47:56.640 --> 02:47:58.080
brother

02:47:58.080 --> 02:47:59.840
brother, what are you doing?

02:47:59.840 --> 02:48:01.840
Why are you playing the paper clip?

02:48:02.240 --> 02:48:03.360
boomi

02:48:03.360 --> 02:48:05.360
Are you serious?

02:48:05.920 --> 02:48:09.680
Why? Oh my god, he's a menace in society. I need a burp

02:48:12.080 --> 02:48:14.080
I hid it from you. You don't deserve my burps

02:48:16.720 --> 02:48:22.400
I need to take off my shirt. I'm getting hot. Oh my god a bird just flew really close by my window

02:48:25.440 --> 02:48:28.480
Two gang is just a palm. Okay, let's let's watch tv

02:48:30.480 --> 02:48:31.680
While I eat

02:48:31.680 --> 02:48:35.600
Could you lock your door? I did lock my door. Why are you knocking on it? I'm gonna come visit

02:48:53.920 --> 02:48:55.920
Wait, can I go back?

02:48:57.440 --> 02:48:59.440
Okay

02:48:59.520 --> 02:49:01.520
Couple months later

02:49:26.400 --> 02:49:28.400
Oh

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:32.000
I

02:49:35.040 --> 02:49:41.840
Feel like the he can't tell you what to do will cause him to probably like send me to the principal's office

02:49:43.520 --> 02:49:45.520
Passive aggressive eye roll

02:49:47.760 --> 02:49:50.720
Mr. White can get it on guys that his name mr. White

02:49:52.640 --> 02:49:54.640
You trust my instincts

02:49:55.040 --> 02:49:57.040
I'm gonna be a bitch

02:50:00.400 --> 02:50:07.520
How dare you how dare you disrupt my lecture. It's disrespectful to me and your classmates

02:50:07.760 --> 02:50:12.720
You can't trick anyone here. Is he Walter white when no one gives a shit about your class in the first place

02:50:13.120 --> 02:50:18.960
Well, how would you like a failing grade? How would all of you like a failing grade?

02:50:19.520 --> 02:50:21.520
Yeah, the girl to the right is kind of hot

02:50:22.560 --> 02:50:26.400
Yeah, mr. White, you can't keep us from graduating you tell him the call. Yeah, you tell him

02:50:26.640 --> 02:50:30.880
You finger skateboard bitch. Oh, I was just trying to help. Yeah, you were trying something

02:50:31.760 --> 02:50:35.600
I can visit to the counselor's office the principal's office

02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:39.760
Hey, if you think not listening to you talk is disciplined, then I'm gone. No problem

02:50:40.160 --> 02:50:42.160
out

02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:49.840
Again, Nicole. Oh, not the counselor. Every time you said a lot of stuff so I can leave early

02:50:50.400 --> 02:50:53.360
The principal ordered for you to be in this room for one hour

02:50:53.840 --> 02:50:57.520
I like how the principal's purse is like in the chair. You'll see them slapping the shit on

02:50:58.080 --> 02:51:00.080
And what do you mean by that?

02:51:00.160 --> 02:51:04.640
How are you feeling? I'm saying if a whole company like them can't get my order, right?

02:51:04.720 --> 02:51:09.280
Then what's one guy like you? Mistakes happen. They can try again after the next soccer practice

02:51:09.520 --> 02:51:12.160
I think we go to Mr. White supremacist. Wait, what?

02:51:12.960 --> 02:51:19.520
I fucking derailed this shit talking out of turn in class bullying classmates talking back to faculty

02:51:20.400 --> 02:51:23.360
Is this really are you gonna kill me? Why am I leaving behind a legacy?

02:51:27.200 --> 02:51:29.200
It's high school who gives a shit fact

02:51:31.440 --> 02:51:37.360
Show some light on everyone else. Hmm like I would just like tell him off like about what everybody else does

02:51:39.600 --> 02:51:42.240
Probably about the gym teacher. It's high school. I'm gonna do that

02:51:42.480 --> 02:51:46.080
Say that to all the guys who go here. It's like a co-ed prison without tattoos

02:51:46.480 --> 02:51:52.080
Do you think it's a tad irresponsible to point fingers at others when you're the one in question here

02:51:52.400 --> 02:51:57.120
Aren't you mr. Child psychologist like trauma and all that shapes who we are?

02:51:57.600 --> 02:52:01.040
Well, yes, I have several degrees in pediatric psychology

02:52:01.760 --> 02:52:07.520
What's your point every dude here is like a rapist or a drug addict or trying to turn you into a drug addict

02:52:07.760 --> 02:52:12.560
Have you tried something? What are you doing? I understand you not try to play in my wires

02:52:12.640 --> 02:52:15.280
I just feel like you're gonna shut off my computer. He's like real cold on

02:52:16.080 --> 02:52:17.360
teacher or

02:52:17.360 --> 02:52:19.360
No, no, no get shoot

02:52:19.360 --> 02:52:21.520
He was like dangerously close

02:52:21.520 --> 02:52:22.960
to

02:52:22.960 --> 02:52:26.720
My power outlet where like the switch would just turn off everything. So if I disappear

02:52:28.160 --> 02:52:33.200
In stream just dies. That is the reason why boomie. What is the matter mr?

02:52:35.280 --> 02:52:37.280
Why don't you go play with fia?

02:52:38.240 --> 02:52:39.520
Hi

02:52:39.520 --> 02:52:42.800
It's important. What's wrong? Okay, let me go get him a toy to play with

02:52:46.800 --> 02:52:48.800
I have the pee

02:52:51.120 --> 02:52:53.120
Okay, let me pee and get him a toy

02:53:16.080 --> 02:53:18.080
You

02:53:46.080 --> 02:53:48.080
You

02:54:16.800 --> 02:54:18.800
You

02:54:19.200 --> 02:54:23.600
All right, can you bitch just stop warping in the chat for the love of god the joke is done

02:54:27.520 --> 02:54:29.520
I was making the shiba aid. Oh, it's pretty good

02:54:30.640 --> 02:54:31.840
real quick

02:54:31.840 --> 02:54:36.000
You might hear like some noises in the background because I gave my cats their toys so that they'll play

02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:39.200
Reina's sleeping nicely by my feet because she is a good old lady

02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:42.000
at the ripe age of 14

02:54:42.560 --> 02:54:43.600
and then

02:54:43.600 --> 02:54:48.240
Boomi and fia are fucking about in my closet playing with a spring toy

02:54:53.840 --> 02:54:57.360
Teachers are trying to fuck me too. You're all psychotic a few months ago

02:54:57.360 --> 02:55:01.200
Mr. Burlodey was really feeling up one of my friends and just last week

02:55:01.200 --> 02:55:03.920
The coach was staring down my shirt during push-up tests

02:55:04.240 --> 02:55:09.760
I tried to level with all my students. So can you really blame him? They really like that spring toy

02:55:09.760 --> 02:55:11.760
That's your favorite toy

02:55:12.240 --> 02:55:14.240
Low cut here

02:55:14.640 --> 02:55:21.040
Go on honestly her outfit is fine. We're looking away the entire time you've been here. Oh my god. That's so fucked

02:55:22.560 --> 02:55:25.360
Are you kidding me right now? Where's the hidden camera? What show is this?

02:55:27.040 --> 02:55:32.400
You're like acting for a prank show, right? I'm waiting for someone more attractive than you to walk in so I can pretend to laugh

02:55:32.800 --> 02:55:36.640
Nicole there's no prank here. Oh, so you're just seriously a pedophile

02:55:37.360 --> 02:55:42.480
He's right here. Did we ever have our little chat on social constructs? I'm leaving

02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:46.000
Oh my fucking god

02:55:46.240 --> 02:55:51.680
So fuck photography. Yeah pretty much mr. White acts like his class is so goddamn important

02:55:51.760 --> 02:55:56.080
We can take pictures with a camera phone who even needs a camera camera anymore

02:55:56.320 --> 02:56:01.760
Exactly message electives get so insecure when they realize they can't stop anyone from graduating

02:56:02.160 --> 02:56:07.840
It'd be happy anyone even took your class. It's an art course. Anyway, I like doing your makeups a huge step down

02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:10.000
What's up you whores? Wow

02:56:10.800 --> 02:56:12.800
I'm gonna spit on my drink

02:56:15.520 --> 02:56:21.120
What do you want all right damn hold on you shit. Wow. What's up you whores?

02:56:26.880 --> 02:56:31.040
That's actually me when I enter any sort of call. Oh my god, the sandwich is so fucking spicy

02:56:31.760 --> 02:56:33.200
with the girls

02:56:33.200 --> 02:56:35.200
That's how I walk in the call

02:56:38.080 --> 02:56:40.080
What's up you whores

02:56:41.440 --> 02:56:49.280
I heard something fall. I think my cats are oh my god. I'm dying. Okay, so I'm drooling. Oh my god. This is so fucking

02:56:53.360 --> 02:56:55.360

I can't I can't

02:56:58.720 --> 02:57:00.720
I

02:57:00.720 --> 02:57:02.720
Oh my god

02:57:03.760 --> 02:57:09.120
I swear to god the sandwich is not spicy. Why is this spicy now? Should I accidentally click spicy in my order?

02:57:11.760 --> 02:57:13.760
I remember

02:57:14.880 --> 02:57:16.880
No, I'm really fighting for my life

02:57:22.320 --> 02:57:27.280
I can't I can't handle spice I get that from my mom actually know my mom can handle spice and soak in my dad

02:57:27.680 --> 02:57:29.680
So I don't even know why I can't handle spice

02:57:31.920 --> 02:57:33.920
Oh my god, the burp is like sucking my fucking throat

02:57:52.960 --> 02:57:54.960
Well, I just got lightheaded

02:57:57.600 --> 02:57:59.600
I

02:58:02.400 --> 02:58:07.680
Let me go get some milk and then I'm gonna go on a live myself in Minecraft

02:58:21.760 --> 02:58:23.760
I'm dying

02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:30.000
It's not supposed to parts

02:58:33.040 --> 02:58:35.040
I just bought it though. Oh, yeah, it's fine

02:58:40.320 --> 02:58:42.320
Oh

02:58:43.600 --> 02:58:45.600
Oh my god, you got your spring

02:58:48.320 --> 02:58:52.320
Okay, yeah, I've only taken like a few bites of that sandwich and I think I'm done

02:58:52.320 --> 02:58:54.320
I

02:58:56.160 --> 02:58:58.160
Need some milk

02:58:59.600 --> 02:59:03.840
The cats are just walking around playing with their toys boomies playing in a plastic bag. What's his spring?

02:59:06.240 --> 02:59:09.280
Can I have it? Can you can you what my sandwich? No

02:59:11.440 --> 02:59:16.000
I'm throwing that motherfucker in the air fryer tomorrow tomorrow. I'm gonna fight for my life tomorrow too actually

02:59:17.840 --> 02:59:19.840
Oh my god, I can't stop hiccuping

02:59:23.280 --> 02:59:25.280
Oh my god, there's so much spit in my mouth

02:59:30.000 --> 02:59:32.000
I can blow bubbles

02:59:36.960 --> 02:59:38.960
I just drooled

02:59:44.560 --> 02:59:49.520
So how are you guys doing you having fun I'm enjoying myself I think

02:59:52.560 --> 02:59:58.800
I feel like I got punched in the stomach. Oh, it's fine. The spice must flow fears the mind to live

03:00:00.960 --> 03:00:02.800
Those movies are good actually

03:00:02.800 --> 03:00:06.720
All right, dude was good book. Actually, no, I didn't end up. Did I finish dude? Did I finish reading dude?

03:00:07.360 --> 03:00:09.600
I don't think I did. I think I got like halfway

03:00:12.400 --> 03:00:17.840
Streams can be a criminal stream's been a criminal disaster in all the best weas

03:00:18.800 --> 03:00:20.640
Or just ball

03:00:20.640 --> 03:00:23.760
Barbie wish you be I'm playing Hades too. Oh, I want to play Hades

03:00:24.480 --> 03:00:26.640
How I said I would like it. I'm still panting

03:00:27.360 --> 03:00:30.640
Dune books get weird. I know a spot. Yeah, I don't have a spice dollars

03:00:32.960 --> 03:00:34.960
My ethnicity failed me

03:00:36.720 --> 03:00:38.720
And I'm like

03:00:39.120 --> 03:00:41.120
My white mother could handle spice way better than me

03:00:43.040 --> 03:00:46.480
Well, you know what I blame my mom because apparently I don't know why I'm talking like this

03:00:46.560 --> 03:00:48.560
You know, I'm not talking like Cartman

03:00:49.200 --> 03:00:51.360
but um

03:00:51.360 --> 03:00:53.360
But it's the only way I can feel like

03:00:53.840 --> 03:00:57.120
My mouth is okay. Um, so my mom when she was pregnant with me

03:00:58.880 --> 03:01:02.000
Only a bottle of chicken wings because I was there like grave

03:01:03.040 --> 03:01:06.320
So I think because of all the spicy food. I just can't handle spicy food

03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:10.000
I don't know

03:01:10.480 --> 03:01:12.480
Hades is goaded

03:01:13.680 --> 03:01:15.680
Crazy respect my authority

03:01:17.280 --> 03:01:23.280
You might hear Fia meowing in the background because she gets really excited when she plays and she starts meowing at herself

03:01:24.960 --> 03:01:26.960
Little girl, what are you doing?

03:01:29.760 --> 03:01:32.560

03:04:26.640 --> 03:04:28.640
It's been three hours

03:04:29.600 --> 03:04:34.880
Oh, my neighbor probably helped hates me because I've been yelling a bunch. Actually, I don't even know if they're home

03:04:44.400 --> 03:04:46.400
Testing it

03:04:46.480 --> 03:04:51.600
Okay, let me move my food that I'm not going to be able to finish to the side because I am dying

03:04:52.400 --> 03:04:56.400
I barely even ate anything. I literally only ate like a couple mozzarella sticks

03:04:56.560 --> 03:04:59.840
And that's what I ate and some tater dots. You know if you buy somebody so much

03:05:00.640 --> 03:05:02.640
um

03:05:03.680 --> 03:05:09.840
Because my alt is blowing up for no reason

03:05:12.560 --> 03:05:15.680
I am going to

03:05:17.440 --> 03:05:20.800
Mess with the algorithm

03:05:21.920 --> 03:05:23.920
here

03:05:24.240 --> 03:05:26.560
And say something about porn

03:05:33.200 --> 03:05:36.000
Why is twitter pushing porn, I don't know

03:05:39.520 --> 03:05:41.840
Also follow my alt

03:05:44.000 --> 03:05:46.000
At she be

03:05:46.160 --> 03:05:48.160
And

03:05:51.680 --> 03:05:58.160
You gotta you gotta play the game you gotta you gotta play the stonks, you know, I'm still dying

03:06:08.400 --> 03:06:13.840
Because uh twitter likes that word now

03:06:16.240 --> 03:06:18.480
Oh my god, my tummy is rumbling bad

03:06:22.720 --> 03:06:24.720
All right

03:06:25.680 --> 03:06:27.680
Oh, no, actually they banned it for a little bit

03:06:32.000 --> 03:06:34.000
Oh

03:06:34.960 --> 03:06:39.360
Guys, I think I think getting this food was a bad idea. I don't feel so good

03:06:39.360 --> 03:06:41.360
I

03:06:43.440 --> 03:06:45.440
Mean dummy heart

03:06:54.800 --> 03:06:56.800
Sorry

03:06:57.520 --> 03:07:03.120
My high pitch voice comes out when I mean they should be excited or super fucked up

03:07:03.120 --> 03:07:08.320
I'm not the sub

03:07:11.520 --> 03:07:13.920
You're the sub you're the sub you're the sub I'm mad I'm

03:07:16.480 --> 03:07:20.080
Even with my cunny voice you're still the sub. You're still a fucking

03:07:27.520 --> 03:07:29.520
Okay

03:07:34.000 --> 03:07:38.720
Yeah, fucking subs I'll make you feel way worse

03:07:41.920 --> 03:07:47.280
Mess their spit on the floor then clean it up use your use your tongue

Even when my my even when my cunny voice you're still a sub so get on your knees

03:07:55.600 --> 03:07:57.600
I like my spit off the floor

03:07:57.840 --> 03:07:59.840
Like a good little puppy

03:08:00.720 --> 03:08:08.880
Fucking prick fucking hell fucking dumb asses bitches. I hate you all

03:08:14.400 --> 03:08:18.320
No, you should talk and mr. White. Yeah, he probably deserves it

03:08:18.960 --> 03:08:24.320
What do you want? All right, damn. Did you guys get an invite to kelly's poll party poll party?

03:08:24.720 --> 03:08:28.240
No, her parents are like really rich. It's glass and and everything. It's kind of actually fucking cool

03:08:29.200 --> 03:08:34.000
They got those four foot long syringe water gun things. What are you 10? Whatever

03:08:36.960 --> 03:08:40.240
I've been here for a year and never once heard of someone having sex with you

03:08:40.480 --> 03:08:45.440
I've been here since third grade and haven't heard it. No, uh, remember freshman year with jenny philmore

03:08:45.600 --> 03:08:47.600
She was unconscious. How do you still brag?

03:08:47.600 --> 03:08:52.880
That's so fast like the reason they have women's college. Okay old news. Whatever you have invites or not

03:08:53.280 --> 03:08:56.320
Yeah, let me too. How did you get one? You haven't even been here

03:08:56.320 --> 03:09:01.520
Because i'm a cool ass bitch. That's why I'm not fat facts. Okay. Well, like her belts

03:09:02.240 --> 03:09:07.600
I used to have belts like that if I can't go. I don't want to be responsible for you ruining the party

03:09:07.680 --> 03:09:10.880
But I also want to listen. I'm a tomboy. I really like boys

03:09:11.680 --> 03:09:13.680
Nicole's choice fine

03:09:13.680 --> 03:09:18.560
Nicole, I know I think I'm getting better, but could you let me go with you just this once?

03:09:19.600 --> 03:09:21.600
I've worn

03:09:22.000 --> 03:09:24.640
I've worn three belts at once

03:09:25.440 --> 03:09:27.440
three belts

03:09:28.080 --> 03:09:32.800
With this this voice sounds better when I put this little mouth on

03:09:33.440 --> 03:09:35.440
Yeah

03:09:37.120 --> 03:09:39.120
Choose the top

03:09:40.080 --> 03:09:42.080
Well, yeah, I was planning on it

03:09:45.440 --> 03:09:52.240
Yeah, no, fuck off fine. Be a bitch. See if I care you're just mad. You can't see us in bikinis this weekend

03:09:52.480 --> 03:09:57.200
What are you doing? What don't get flustered like that. He's a rapist sex turns

03:09:57.360 --> 03:10:03.760
Rapist right to those types. What like choking and biting that and jerking off while thinking about us suddenly turning into

03:10:03.920 --> 03:10:08.000
Jekyll would look so hot with her organs gouged out. Hell. Yeah. How do you know these things?

03:10:08.400 --> 03:10:10.720
I had a brother. You had up. Is he dead?

03:10:12.080 --> 03:10:17.680
Did you fucking kill your brother? Are you wearing to Kelly's pool party? Well summer's over. So no, we're selling anything

03:10:17.840 --> 03:10:20.160
Hello girls. Oh fucking this guy again

03:10:20.240 --> 03:10:27.760
Pool party in the fall? Yeah. Well, I don't know Jeffery mode. My place is Jeffery mode. I could help you out with that

03:10:28.080 --> 03:10:34.400
You sell bikinis? Of course not. But swing by my office later and we can take some measurements for the homex sewing club

03:10:34.400 --> 03:10:36.400
Oh my god, this guy creeps me out so bad

03:10:36.960 --> 03:10:42.960
To your every curve. Gee. Thanks. I'll see you there. Maybe have a good day at school

03:10:44.880 --> 03:10:48.880
Yes, I know her brother's fucking alive. It was a fucking rhetorical question. You idiots

03:10:49.600 --> 03:10:54.320
What are you guys freaking out about? I think the counselor might have made an advance at me

03:10:54.400 --> 03:10:56.400
They're made in advance. Who says that?

03:10:58.320 --> 03:11:05.040
Yawn, what else is new? What? You've gone here longer than me. How did you not notice? To be fair, he's kind of subtle about it

03:11:05.360 --> 03:11:07.840
He's what I call a marathon pedophile

03:11:08.560 --> 03:11:16.320
Sorry, but what the fuck is a marathon? Fuck, I got a toot. He tries to make you question society's hatred of pedophilia before he actually

03:11:16.480 --> 03:11:22.560
molests you then you'll feel bad. That's actually really fucked up. So he guilt you so he can make a routine out of it

03:11:22.880 --> 03:11:27.280
Exactly a predator. Are you the same age as the count? Is the counselor 56?

03:11:27.760 --> 03:11:31.920
That's like three levels worse than what I thought he was gonna do. I don't know. Why do you even want to measure you anyway?

03:11:32.160 --> 03:11:38.400
For bikini to wear a killie's pool party. He'd have home ec make it home ec. What are they gonna make a fucking felt bathing?

03:11:38.400 --> 03:11:40.400
Yeah, I was like, how are you gonna make anything?

03:11:42.160 --> 03:11:44.160
Okay, I think I'm good. I think it's yeah

03:11:44.880 --> 03:11:50.400
You planned on swimming at a pool party. What do you do at a pool party sit around and look cute same?

03:11:51.120 --> 03:11:53.120
Yeah, that's yeah

03:11:53.920 --> 03:11:55.920
Never been to a pool party, but sure

03:11:56.720 --> 03:12:02.400
The school saw no one steals shit anyway. You still aren't dressed. Yeah, they need thumbprint scanners or some shit

03:12:02.640 --> 03:12:07.200
It's 2008. Isn't it the future by now? You're gonna be late. No shit

03:12:07.920 --> 03:12:11.600
Now how many spends again? Oh wait, hold on. Nailed it. What the fuck?

03:12:12.320 --> 03:12:15.600
There's no lock on the doors saw it as a great opportunity

03:12:28.960 --> 03:12:32.960
Choke him out if that happened to me. I'm sorry. Do you think you're cool right now?

03:12:33.200 --> 03:12:39.760
You're a freak not even the sex being counselor wants to fuck you your petty insults will make the development of this photograph

03:12:39.840 --> 03:12:41.840
All the more satisfying

03:12:41.920 --> 03:12:48.560
Cam girls are all cheap digital nonsense. I've captured your I'm cheap digital nonsense. That's me

03:12:48.720 --> 03:12:50.720
I'm cheap digital nonsense

03:12:54.480 --> 03:12:59.120
Yeah, if you're gonna sexually harass me could you not talk like a cartoon character while you do it

03:12:59.440 --> 03:13:01.440
I do what I want with my words

03:13:02.080 --> 03:13:08.080
I'll also do as I please with this photo. No, come on. Just throw the film out. I'm afraid I can't do that

03:13:08.560 --> 03:13:14.080
Every boy with a crush on you should pay top dollar for these prints. That I would literally kill him

03:13:18.320 --> 03:13:20.640
No, I should have been nice to him. Oh, no

03:13:27.200 --> 03:13:33.600
You won't convince me otherwise runs away. Wait, was I at the wrong locker? Oh my god, you're all really

03:13:38.080 --> 03:13:41.680
I need a lock on that door. Thanks hindsight. So what the fuck do I do right now?

03:13:41.840 --> 03:13:44.560
This is gonna ruin my life. Well, technically isn't that like

03:13:45.200 --> 03:13:50.080
Child pornography if it takes a picture and tries to spread it has a picture of my titties halfway out

03:13:50.320 --> 03:13:57.040
Yeah, they'll probably find a way to make it your fault. Anyway, I still can't believe he shot it on medium format film of all

03:13:58.400 --> 03:14:04.640
Look, I'm just worried about the print the film type parents in the 70s. Wait, like film film

03:14:05.040 --> 03:14:09.200
Like it needs to be Jeffrey's Jeffrey's a very nice guy up to tomorrow's film club

03:14:09.840 --> 03:14:15.600
That bitch no lab. No developing if it's some weird format. There won't be another one for miles and miles, right?

03:14:16.240 --> 03:14:18.160
Destroying the dark room

03:14:18.160 --> 03:14:22.320
But I get expelled for that if you go in after everybody leaves no one needs to know

03:14:22.640 --> 03:14:25.760
Just wear gloves or something so you don't leave finger. Oh smart

03:14:26.640 --> 03:14:32.640
If I have any very smart. No, it's not my ass on film. Come on. I'd help if it was you

03:14:33.280 --> 03:14:35.040
No, you wouldn't

03:14:35.040 --> 03:14:36.640
Okay, I wouldn't but

03:14:36.640 --> 03:14:37.600
God damn it

03:14:37.600 --> 03:14:41.200
Is it really the end of the world if people see you in your underwear? You look good naked

03:14:41.520 --> 03:14:46.000
Yeah, exactly if I had weird tits and a gut it'd be classified as an artistic nude

03:14:46.240 --> 03:14:49.200
But if you're hot with no clothes on it's porn

03:14:49.920 --> 03:14:54.160
Fine, I'll drive you over there, but I'm not stepping a foot inside artistic anew. Let's go

03:14:58.000 --> 03:15:00.800
Wow, I am creative when it comes to destroying things

03:15:01.600 --> 03:15:02.480
Are you done yet?

03:15:02.480 --> 03:15:07.040
Yeah, set it on fire. This should buy me enough time to swipe Jeffrey's camera and ruin the negative

03:15:07.360 --> 03:15:09.040
Hey, do you have permission to-

03:15:09.040 --> 03:15:10.880
Why is there a cop?

03:15:10.880 --> 03:15:12.080
Uh

03:15:12.080 --> 03:15:15.200
If I said a teacher told me to meet here for a date

03:15:15.280 --> 03:15:19.440
Would you go after him or just blame me for that too a date in your pajamas?

03:15:19.760 --> 03:15:25.920
Did he tell you to destroy thousands in school property too? Look at this place come with me. What it was like this when I

03:15:27.040 --> 03:15:28.880
Sleep walked in here

03:15:28.880 --> 03:15:30.880
You wear gloves to bed

03:15:32.240 --> 03:15:33.920
Yeah, don't you?

03:15:33.920 --> 03:15:37.200
Well, so much for jack a stupid fucking glove idea to this day

03:15:37.280 --> 03:15:41.040
I genuinely believe sleepwalking would have worked if it wasn't for wearing those

03:15:41.440 --> 03:15:45.440
Anyway, I got statewide expulsion. Yeah, I didn't know it was a thingy. Oh, no, that sucks

03:15:45.760 --> 03:15:46.480
I'm used to move again

03:15:46.480 --> 03:15:50.320
Forced me to get a shitty job and hits me to relieve her feelings of disappointment

03:15:50.800 --> 03:15:54.880
The deep fryer leaving craters on my face. No, I don't like this ending

03:15:55.280 --> 03:15:57.280
Is a suicidal experience

03:15:57.600 --> 03:16:00.000
Wow, the camera really does add 10 pounds fuck off

03:16:01.120 --> 03:16:03.120
No

03:16:28.240 --> 03:16:36.960
What the one the other mouth on I look way too devilish I look normal fun like this when I'm like

03:16:53.120 --> 03:16:55.120
I'm just gonna look at you

03:16:57.680 --> 03:17:08.800
I'm so disappointed in myself. I'm not even joking. Yeah, there's no stream. I took a break today

03:17:10.160 --> 03:17:14.240
Uh, love you all. Let's uh find someone to read

03:17:20.000 --> 03:17:22.000
I will simply pass away

03:17:27.680 --> 03:17:29.680
Can I please read her eyes, please?

03:17:32.720 --> 03:17:35.200
Oh, at least there's only like 300 of you watching

03:17:44.320 --> 03:17:51.360
Oh god, I've given myself a headache. Let's see who's live right now

03:17:57.280 --> 03:18:00.880
Because I'm like, oh, I can't wait to make nobody's gonna want to be friends with me

I'm just gonna send you to straw nation. I don't know how to handle you and

03:18:19.920 --> 03:18:21.920
I already know you're gonna tell on me

03:18:22.160 --> 03:18:24.160
Whatever do your worst

You just won't get nice Maros for a week. Hmm. I won't say zero. Hmm. Hmm

I'm gonna go cry into my pillow and

03:19:08.720 --> 03:19:10.720
Regret all my life choices
