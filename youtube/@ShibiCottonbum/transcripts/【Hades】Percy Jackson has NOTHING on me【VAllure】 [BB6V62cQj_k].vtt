00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
You

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
You

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
You

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
You

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
You

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
You

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
You

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
You

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
You

05:00.000 --> 05:19.800
Let's see how this works. I don't know where the game went. Hey gone. Oh, there it is

05:19.800 --> 05:33.800
They and Samara was good. How do I sound? I don't know. Does this $400 thing make a difference. I

05:37.800 --> 05:39.800
Bet I sound the same

05:39.800 --> 05:41.800
I

05:43.800 --> 05:48.640
Was asleep watching strong even she rated it from here would have been perfect but an animal give all

05:52.800 --> 05:58.800
Tyler one Mike sounding great. You think it does make a difference. Does it sound worse?

06:02.560 --> 06:05.300
It was a comfy, okay, I'm glad you guys like the ASMR

06:09.800 --> 06:14.560
I sound clear, but I'm peeking. I I had a feeling that would happen

06:16.120 --> 06:18.120
Let's see if I can fix that

06:22.520 --> 06:25.880
You look broken I can fix that sorry I

06:26.680 --> 06:32.080
Guess I can I have a playback in my headphones and I do sound I just a bit

06:32.560 --> 06:34.560
Just a wee bit peeky

06:35.760 --> 06:37.760
Just a wee bit

06:38.760 --> 06:44.360
And I don't know if that would be the gain perhaps I

06:48.800 --> 06:54.080
Turn that down just a tad. I don't know. I don't know if that helped

06:54.080 --> 07:08.800
When is the peaking it sounds really good, okay, I don't know why it like peaks am I like too close?

07:08.800 --> 07:12.160
I don't even know how I would fix that to be honest with you

07:16.160 --> 07:18.160
That's better

07:21.920 --> 07:23.920
A lot better

07:24.600 --> 07:29.520
Yeah, yeah, I'm glad

07:38.000 --> 07:42.160
Wait, did I lock my door my doors unlocked hold on I

07:44.400 --> 07:46.400
Went downstairs

07:54.080 --> 08:00.720
Packages and I forgot to lock the door as per usual nothing new there

08:11.640 --> 08:16.480
What do you mean, what do you mean, please? What do you mean, please? I

08:17.480 --> 08:23.680
Want to see what the delay is on this

08:26.360 --> 08:29.400
It's been weird

08:47.480 --> 08:51.080
I can't tell it's not showing me

09:00.160 --> 09:02.160
Oh

09:02.480 --> 09:06.640
Why does it keep doing that? I'm like, come on come on

09:07.880 --> 09:12.840
Huh, I don't know if it's like something in my settings like either or it will

09:13.840 --> 09:17.520
Be like a little bit behind but it's fine. I'm mostly gonna be

09:18.440 --> 09:22.680
Playing anyway, so we don't have to have like super live interaction. Oh

09:24.040 --> 09:26.800
YouTube you silly silly silly Billy

09:30.240 --> 09:32.240
All right

09:32.480 --> 09:35.600
Sorry, I'm happy cuz and that's why my voice is getting higher. I

09:37.040 --> 09:41.600
Know some people are like, why is she talking in an ooo voice? I'm sorry when I get happy

09:41.600 --> 09:46.840
I talk in my ooo voice. I can't help it. I'm excited to play the game and spend time with you guys

09:49.800 --> 09:51.800
Hello

09:53.400 --> 09:59.920
He is meowing to herself while she's playing with her toy. Okay, so yeah, I've never played this before

09:59.920 --> 10:07.000
I've never watched anything about it. I know nothing about it besides Greek gods and I love Greek gods in Greek mythology

10:07.240 --> 10:09.560
So I'm like so ready to get into this

10:10.320 --> 10:13.960
And you guys know I love called the lamb and you guys said it's a roguelike and

10:14.440 --> 10:19.400
I've seen the art before like I've seen the art of Aphrodite when that was going viral and I was like wow

10:19.400 --> 10:20.840
I love his art style

10:20.840 --> 10:22.240
so

10:22.240 --> 10:24.240
I'm very happy

10:24.920 --> 10:30.800
Rain is still running around all hyper she's napping right now, but I was so surprised I was like, oh, what the heck?

10:30.800 --> 10:32.480
What are you doing?

10:32.480 --> 10:34.480
She was

10:35.360 --> 10:38.520
He's looking at me now actually she just like I think she heard her name

10:38.920 --> 10:44.720
She's watching the other cats play with the toy, but yeah, she was playing with I was like crying

10:45.400 --> 10:47.400
Because I was so happy to see her playing

10:48.320 --> 10:50.520
It's it was really funny. She like

10:51.160 --> 10:56.760
Poop and then had the zoobies. I'm like, are you serious? Did you just really need to take a shit? Oh

10:58.600 --> 11:00.960
Wait, this is look what I can do now. Holy

11:02.160 --> 11:04.160
Oh my god

11:04.480 --> 11:06.480
Oh

11:14.280 --> 11:17.520
Is the game you did. Oh, yes, I think accidentally muted it

11:19.160 --> 11:23.780
There you go, I don't know if you guys can hear it the little beep noises

11:25.520 --> 11:30.640
So anytime I swear I can just be like, oh, I hate the I can't believe this

11:34.480 --> 11:38.440
It's quiet. Okay, hold on. I'm turn that shit up. Oh

11:44.200 --> 11:47.260
My is that

11:47.260 --> 11:49.260
I

12:00.540 --> 12:04.340
Realize you guys are like in my head like a bit smaller

12:06.500 --> 12:12.180
But I think hold on let's can we just mess could we just hang out and mess around for just a moment

12:12.980 --> 12:15.240
It's just just for a quick momento

12:18.260 --> 12:22.780
What if you beep before you say the word and still say the word what the

12:31.220 --> 12:33.220
Language lady I

12:33.620 --> 12:39.100
Can also mute with this thing wait, hold on. I want to see I don't know if reverb works

12:39.740 --> 12:42.580
I don't know if it works because I can't with the

12:42.980 --> 12:48.340
My mic monitor doesn't tell me if anything's changing. So I don't know if I have reverb

12:50.500 --> 12:54.900
So you guys can tell me my cat is attacking my freaking

12:57.740 --> 12:59.740
What are they called slippers

13:01.500 --> 13:07.380
Have we not always been the voices in your head all the things you said all the things she said right through my head

13:07.380 --> 13:09.380
But he asked you guys

13:10.180 --> 13:11.680
I

13:11.680 --> 13:17.680
Don't know if also like this works. I don't know if this works. I'm a is it giving me a robot voice you tell me

13:18.900 --> 13:25.700
Fia, can you please stop chewing on my foot? I beg you please let go of my slipper

13:29.140 --> 13:33.900
Did it work, I don't know again chats delayed so I'm just sitting here like oh

13:34.780 --> 13:37.300
Is it working and I'm just being goofy

13:40.260 --> 13:42.260
I

13:44.540 --> 13:51.580
Don't know why she's attacking my slippers. Boomi was doing it earlier, too. It doesn't work. Okay, that's weird

13:51.580 --> 13:53.580
I have to figure that out then

13:55.340 --> 13:57.340
What if

13:58.620 --> 14:03.420
What if I do this no, this is gonna that'll mess everything up, but I have set up

14:09.380 --> 14:13.460
Yeah, I think there's like something I have to do where I can route it through

14:15.340 --> 14:20.140
The thing but it doesn't do that for some reason

14:24.260 --> 14:29.620
Cuz like I'll press stuff and like pressing robot voice, but then I

14:30.740 --> 14:32.740
Can't hear anything

14:34.100 --> 14:38.500
And then I'm turning up the reverb on my computer instead of on my

14:39.380 --> 14:42.100
XLR and so doesn't do anything. I

14:43.060 --> 14:49.420
Don't know why it is what it is. What are your toes? No, I just took a shower. I don't know what you're talking about

14:49.420 --> 14:52.740
I just took a shower. I just took a shower

14:55.100 --> 14:59.740
Wait a second did I figure it out

15:10.180 --> 15:15.980
I don't know if that does anything. Is it working?

15:23.540 --> 15:25.540
Je ne sais pas

15:27.140 --> 15:33.980
My feet aren't stinky ever got what she was is this for YouTube because Twitter's ocean marks don't get displayed in the actual video. Oh

15:34.980 --> 15:41.260
Okay, sorry, I just saw that harlot question. Which stream did the heal mark replace rope? Yeah, cuz the rope doesn't come up

15:41.940 --> 15:44.220
It neither does the other bunny emo

15:44.540 --> 15:49.580
So this is what you can use instead if you would like to use my oh she marks, which I appreciate

15:50.020 --> 15:52.020
I

16:03.140 --> 16:05.140
So weird

16:07.620 --> 16:09.620
Oh, I'm gonna Google this

16:09.940 --> 16:14.460
This is our pre chat. This is our pre pre game chat. Okay?

16:15.060 --> 16:17.060
how to make

16:17.580 --> 16:22.660
Go XLR effects work on

16:24.860 --> 16:26.860
Oh, yes

16:47.260 --> 16:57.340
People I can't read forums they just confuse me. I don't know anything about I

17:00.540 --> 17:04.460
Don't know anything about audio. I'm not audio literate at all

17:05.620 --> 17:08.380
40 minutes pre chat of me just messing around with my go XLR

17:08.380 --> 17:13.900
Hey, at least it's not like five hours that it took with me and Azura

17:13.900 --> 17:17.300
She was helping me with all of my audio and

17:18.140 --> 17:23.260
Also my 3d audio and so was mercy at some point she popped in because I was doing an illicit stream to test it and

17:24.700 --> 17:26.700
The girl said it sounded fine and

17:27.340 --> 17:30.780
And as there is like if anyone complains it's them and I'm like bet

17:31.380 --> 17:33.460
and people complained it's you guys whatever

17:34.180 --> 17:36.180
and

17:37.620 --> 17:42.020
But we still weren't able to figure out how to get the effects to work

17:43.020 --> 17:49.300
Um on there, so I think I need to do more research. I asked my manager and my manager is like how the fuck am I

17:51.740 --> 17:55.500
They were just like I don't have one. I'm like, okay. I thought you just knew everything. I'm so sorry

17:57.620 --> 17:59.620
Excuse me

18:01.580 --> 18:05.220
But I buy one off Craigslist and send it to them be like show me how to use this

18:07.660 --> 18:10.780
How to use voice effects

18:13.020 --> 18:15.020
With go XLR

18:26.140 --> 18:28.140
Is this person gonna show me how

18:31.660 --> 18:39.580
Why is he who makes a video and has themselves so far away from the camera so you can't see what people are doing

18:42.020 --> 18:46.180
I don't understand did anybody comment with some

18:56.780 --> 18:58.780
This is making my brain hurt

18:59.940 --> 19:03.220
I'll do this after I wanted to show you guys but

19:04.580 --> 19:08.980
Percy Jackson mentioned did you watch the live action one? I thought it was pretty good

19:12.100 --> 19:16.100
Let me just click on one of these what is a gender knob am I

19:16.940 --> 19:19.340
Am I gonna turn into a man if I

19:21.980 --> 19:26.020
Why is that an audio thing? I don't know what that means

19:26.700 --> 19:31.500
Echo it's the type of echo that you understand. Oh now that one's a multi-tap and really

19:36.780 --> 19:40.620
Sorry, it was the video I wish I had subtitles so I can read. Oh it does

19:43.020 --> 19:46.540
Cool do I double tap it to make it work?

19:48.500 --> 19:50.500
No, all right

19:52.780 --> 19:54.780
FX

19:56.140 --> 20:00.020
No, I'm just like putting reverb on my voice. Although it doesn't exist

20:01.500 --> 20:08.620
At least the beep works. That's all I care about. What the f*** if you look at me with your dumb

20:09.340 --> 20:11.900
Face I swear to God I'm going to

20:23.900 --> 20:25.900
Mom

20:26.860 --> 20:28.860
Your mom

20:34.060 --> 20:38.140
This is every time I'm plugging it plugging it back in I have

20:38.620 --> 20:40.620
my

20:42.540 --> 20:49.820
Insults are invigorating. I'm glad. Let's see if there's a software update devices up to date global settings

20:52.380 --> 20:54.380
What does that say

21:00.700 --> 21:03.660
Oh, I can connect to my stream deck that's cool. I

21:04.380 --> 21:08.140
Don't really need to do that though

21:11.260 --> 21:15.260
So that means I could probably add more effects to my stream deck that's pretty nifty

21:20.140 --> 21:22.140
Yes, yes indeed

21:25.380 --> 21:28.100
Actually, I am tempted to unplug it and plug it back in

21:28.820 --> 21:34.300
Because it doesn't make sense why the effects wouldn't work at least the microphone part works. I

21:37.940 --> 21:46.100
Don't get it presets big echo big verb

21:51.100 --> 21:53.100
No

21:59.060 --> 22:01.060
No

22:07.060 --> 22:12.180
Herm interesting. Whoa, that's loud. Holy crap. I just made it louder

22:14.660 --> 22:16.660
Oh, oh my god

22:19.700 --> 22:21.700
Faders

22:22.580 --> 22:23.940
Effects

22:23.940 --> 22:30.260
Because this is this group reverb echo. Yeah, I think it might just be my thing. Maybe I do have to unplug it and plug it back in

22:31.380 --> 22:32.740
samples

22:32.740 --> 22:34.260
ooh

22:34.260 --> 22:36.260
Bro, I'm about to become a dj

22:36.340 --> 22:39.060
Call me icy the way I'm about to become a dj

22:41.540 --> 22:49.540
Okay, let's play shall we presets or presets? I don't know what you're both. Why not both, you know both

22:51.940 --> 22:53.940
Also, make sure

22:56.020 --> 23:04.500
Oh, thanks for the member is equal as well. And oh, let me actually read any don't know for last stream because I've ended stream

23:05.140 --> 23:07.140
Before I could read any don't knows

23:14.980 --> 23:17.460
Nice there is no don't knows

23:21.780 --> 23:23.780
Oh

23:25.300 --> 23:29.860
Nothing to worry about then perfect

23:39.220 --> 23:42.020
Yeah, we're playing already. Well, I just peeked the mic. I'm sorry

23:45.540 --> 23:49.620
All right, and nothing to worry about and there are a pair of super chats. Let me see

23:50.340 --> 23:52.340
Oh

23:52.900 --> 23:54.900
Yeah, you're right. Okay

23:56.500 --> 24:02.500
Wait, is that from the day before hold on stream allowance is weird. Sometimes stuff doesn't load properly

24:04.340 --> 24:08.340
Let me just refresh this page. What if I log out along back in?

24:10.580 --> 24:16.340
App store plays endless zone zero today. I saw that I might play it. I usually don't I haven't played any hoyo

24:16.900 --> 24:18.900
Uh verse games

24:18.900 --> 24:20.900
now I'm tempted

24:22.020 --> 24:26.260
I'm sorry. So there's someone who subscribed to my channel and their name is just oh god

24:28.900 --> 24:30.900
That's funny

24:31.060 --> 24:33.540
All right, there's two super chats from charlie spur

24:34.580 --> 24:38.260
Both two dollars. Thank you charlie. By the way, can we lay in your lap?

24:39.140 --> 24:41.460
And oh, hey, she's not cursed this time

24:42.980 --> 24:44.980
I wish I knew the river the context for those

24:47.220 --> 24:49.220
But that was it

24:52.260 --> 24:56.100
How much prep time have you given percy jackson access to water?

24:56.900 --> 25:02.100
Can I beep her? Oh, yeah, I definitely could in a fight. That's a whole ass child. I could beat him up

25:03.300 --> 25:05.300
I just kick him

25:05.380 --> 25:08.100
Punch. I don't need water. I just find him in the desert

25:08.100 --> 25:15.380
The eyes pop up beautifully under this black screen wow

25:16.900 --> 25:18.580
Wow, wow

25:18.580 --> 25:23.460
My eye color might change when I get the tan toggle. I'm thinking blue eyes

25:24.260 --> 25:26.260
white dragon

25:28.100 --> 25:30.100
But only for the toggle I think

25:32.500 --> 25:35.300
Your muppet is the cursed part. Oh that makes sense

25:35.300 --> 25:39.220
I'll kick him always. What pop what pop?

25:42.100 --> 25:44.580
Okay, I got my controller

25:45.780 --> 25:50.580
I'm so excited to see this. I love how watching different people play this game and someone said there was voice acting

25:53.380 --> 25:58.260
Blue eyes sigmes cat I was thinking um future model

25:58.900 --> 26:04.740
I'll actually be a himalayan rabbit because it's close to a sigmes cat because they have the same gene genetic thing

26:05.300 --> 26:10.500
Where um their extremities are brown because of the change in temperature

26:12.260 --> 26:14.500
Are you familiar with this game not at all?

26:17.620 --> 26:19.620
Hit him with them

26:19.860 --> 26:21.860
We get it you have blue eyes

26:22.660 --> 26:24.660
It's fully voiced

26:24.740 --> 26:26.340
ah sweet

26:26.340 --> 26:28.340
Okay, then I don't have to do anything

26:30.100 --> 26:32.100
Although I could I bet there's an option to

26:32.820 --> 26:34.820
change that though

26:35.060 --> 26:37.060
Yeah

26:41.220 --> 26:45.620
I'm wondering if I should voice act. No, I don't have to I'll let the people talk and I'll just enjoy myself

26:47.540 --> 26:55.300

Whoops, um, okay, I don't know. I can't do that whatever that is

28:24.820 --> 28:26.820

Uh get these guys

31:11.940 --> 31:13.940
There she is

31:14.100 --> 31:17.460
Who is this got to be her zagroos? There's nothing

31:19.140 --> 31:21.140
In the name of Hades

31:21.300 --> 31:23.300
I accept this message

31:23.300 --> 31:25.300
Zagrus, what is he the god of?

31:26.100 --> 31:29.140
He's a demi god. What is he? I really I recognize his name

31:30.500 --> 31:32.500
Uh, he's he is a son of Hades

31:34.580 --> 31:36.580
Don't tell me

31:39.700 --> 31:41.700
It's not like nightmares

31:42.580 --> 31:50.100
He's pretty eyes. He's a one red one green eye. I love the color palette with the random dash of green. It's very interesting

31:54.420 --> 31:58.420
Hmm. All right, you can tell me what is he the god of?

32:03.140 --> 32:08.100
I got a good one for my first son of the big fella. He's the god of talking smack

32:08.100 --> 32:10.100
Yeah

32:11.460 --> 32:13.460
Hades nuts

32:15.460 --> 32:19.540
Hail noble cousin now, let's get you from that miserable place

32:19.940 --> 32:23.540
I'll see that all of us upon Olympus to our part beginning here with me

32:24.260 --> 32:27.860
Okay, she's goddess of wisdom, you know Athena

32:29.460 --> 32:31.460
It says it there

32:32.260 --> 32:34.260
He's got a blood

32:34.820 --> 32:43.220
He's not Dionysus. Is he a Dionysus counterpart? I'm looking this up because I I like mythology. I'm looking this up

32:55.460 --> 32:58.980
Zagrus is a god associated with rebirth hunting in the underworld

32:59.300 --> 33:03.380
His name translates to great hunter in greek and in the epic Al Simeonus

33:03.620 --> 33:08.580
He is called the highest of all gods Zagrus is also associated with the wine god dying. Oh, okay

33:09.140 --> 33:15.140
Uh, that wine god Dionysus in an orphic tradition. He's considered the first incarnation of Dionysus. Okay. I stand corrected

33:18.260 --> 33:20.260
A son of Zeus and Persephone

33:21.780 --> 33:23.780
What

33:24.340 --> 33:26.340
Oh well

33:27.300 --> 33:34.900
Other stories identify him as a son of Hades or even as Hades himself. Oh, yeah, there's a lot of gods that kind of get like mixed up

33:38.020 --> 33:40.020
Uh

33:40.980 --> 33:45.940
Interesting because there's different forms of myths and

33:47.780 --> 33:49.780
Because like

33:49.780 --> 33:51.780
I

33:52.020 --> 33:58.340
Little odyssey might depict something just as an example might depict a god as this but another

33:59.460 --> 34:01.460
Writing depicts them as this

34:04.740 --> 34:06.340
The name

34:06.340 --> 34:11.220
Zagrus derives from Zagrit, which is properly a pit for catching animals

34:11.300 --> 34:15.620
But also one used for depositing animal remains or offerings to a catholic deity

34:15.940 --> 34:19.620
Making Zagrus literally the god of pitfalls

34:22.020 --> 34:24.500
Hunter that catches living animals or

34:26.260 --> 34:28.500
Direct translation would be catcher of game

34:30.820 --> 34:32.820
I would like to know

34:36.660 --> 34:40.020
Oh, yeah, epic Al Simeonus, Mistress Earth Gaia and Zagrus

34:40.820 --> 34:42.340
Zagreus

34:42.340 --> 34:48.580
I'm say Zagreus highest of all the gods perhaps mean the highest god in the underworld

34:49.780 --> 34:51.780
Interesting interesting

34:53.540 --> 34:55.540
Hold on

34:57.780 --> 35:01.460
Zagreus from the Euripides fragment and suggestive Dionysus

35:07.780 --> 35:09.780
Interesting

35:10.980 --> 35:17.620
This Dionysus Zagreus was a son of Zeus and Persephone he was as an infant attacked and dismembered by the titans

35:18.180 --> 35:20.820
So later aboard as a son of Zeus and some now

35:21.700 --> 35:23.540
assembly

35:23.540 --> 35:27.940
Huh, huh. So I'm just reading the Wikipedia page because Wikipedia is very truthful

35:30.020 --> 35:35.060

35:57.780 --> 36:05.460

36:07.300 --> 36:09.300
Yes indeed

36:09.380 --> 36:11.380
Oh

36:13.700 --> 36:15.700
Okay, uh

36:41.940 --> 36:46.420

Can't heal myself, but I can fight

37:12.820 --> 37:14.820
I like the voice acting

37:16.580 --> 37:19.780
Oh do I just pick up my diamonds?

37:21.860 --> 37:23.860
How do I dash?

37:24.740 --> 37:26.740
Nope, that's not it. Um

37:32.180 --> 37:34.820
Oh, that's pretty cool. I see it now

37:34.980 --> 37:36.980

41:40.580 --> 41:42.580
The risk is not to me

41:42.740 --> 41:46.180
I expected the olympians would involve themselves in this eventually

41:46.660 --> 41:50.020
Is it next the mother of no more than they already know?

41:50.740 --> 41:52.740

He's a guy that was dipped in the river

44:37.940 --> 44:41.940
For protection, but she only held on by his little achilles heel

44:42.740 --> 44:45.940
And that's where he died and that's why we call it an achilles heel

45:46.100 --> 45:49.140
Oh, uh, hi dad stupid boy

45:50.100 --> 45:53.060
I told you no that is such a badass design for hades

45:54.340 --> 45:57.300
Who how was your wanton ransacking of my domain?

45:58.260 --> 46:00.260
I love the reverb on his voice

46:00.740 --> 46:02.020
Greetings, father

46:02.020 --> 46:08.500
My ransacking was a delight. Thank you for asking. It really like is the air that we're in a big hall. The echo is really good touch

46:09.860 --> 46:11.860
Be on your way indeed

46:11.860 --> 46:13.380
What do I care?

46:13.380 --> 46:15.380
You shall never reach the surface

46:16.260 --> 46:18.260
Go see for yourself

46:18.660 --> 46:20.420
This is so cool

46:20.420 --> 46:23.140
Because yeah, hades is also the god of like money

46:24.340 --> 46:26.340
And that's a really good touch

46:26.340 --> 46:28.340
That they have like him covered in jewels

46:29.300 --> 46:31.300
Wow, I love it

46:31.620 --> 46:34.020
What's this? Can I see you see these blueprints?

46:35.220 --> 46:37.220
All right, um

46:37.220 --> 46:39.220
Looks like I go this way probably

46:41.540 --> 46:44.580
Hey room, I'm back room

46:46.740 --> 46:52.740
Mirror mirror on the wall. Here's the handsomeest little boy in the mall night in darkness guide me

46:52.740 --> 46:54.740
Okay

46:56.820 --> 46:59.140
Oh, all right, um

47:05.300 --> 47:09.300
Okay, I'm gonna do this one

47:12.340 --> 47:20.180
The power of darkness a power of darkness compels you the bed chambers of prince zagreous lie in a perpetual

47:20.180 --> 47:22.180
Look at my little bed

47:22.180 --> 47:24.180
I have just a child teenage boy room

47:25.060 --> 47:30.820
Repeatedly insisting that he pick everything up second game calls him homer. Oh that makes so much sense then

47:32.820 --> 47:34.820
Then it's homer

47:38.980 --> 47:42.340
That's a good savory snoring he's dragging a chair across the floor

47:43.060 --> 47:45.780
But I know he had a good mustache. Will she be reached the surface?

47:46.660 --> 47:49.780
Do I bet this game is long and I don't just reach the surface

47:52.100 --> 47:54.420
Rest question mark need to sleep

47:55.380 --> 47:58.740
I don't know. Why do you have a bed then you're a freaking god? I like you have a cyclops head

47:59.300 --> 48:02.820
Pretty sick. You have a smaller one. You have a lot of smaller ones

48:02.820 --> 48:07.380
Then you have a gorgon head which it doesn't really make sense that the gorgon head has

48:09.940 --> 48:12.580
Like a skeleton hair but go off this

48:13.300 --> 48:15.300
Excuse me, um

48:16.580 --> 48:21.860
Cool, I like it. Look at my clothes. Do I like to write?

48:23.380 --> 48:28.980
Nifty, so I probably die a lot and come back if I have to come back and reflect often

48:32.420 --> 48:38.020
What is it? Oh, okay, so it looks like I can get hades his pitchfork

48:38.980 --> 48:45.460
A little poker need to find a key and then I'm assuming that's something of

48:46.820 --> 48:49.700
Aries again, I'm just guessing this based off of aesthetic

48:52.900 --> 48:57.380
And then look like uh, Athena's bow. I mean not Athena's bow. What's her name?

48:58.820 --> 49:02.180
Artemis's bow. I can escape through that pink window there

49:02.980 --> 49:06.820
Why do I want to get out so bad? What happened? Why do I hate my dad?

49:07.060 --> 49:09.060
I just want to walk over here first. Oh

49:10.980 --> 49:12.980
I can do this

49:13.140 --> 49:15.140
First get past the retrochates of Tartarus

49:16.420 --> 49:19.540
Easier said than done and doubtless. I'll be running into Meg

49:20.740 --> 49:25.540
I remember flame ought to be just beyond Meg from find a way up to Elysium Hercules

49:27.780 --> 49:29.940
Magara, let's give it another shot

49:30.900 --> 49:33.860
Are this chamber reached five? Okay, cool

49:34.580 --> 49:40.420
What's that? No, keep sex yet. Oh fascinating. Okay

49:42.020 --> 49:46.420
Cool, cool, cool. Hi Nori. I love you too, Nori

49:49.860 --> 49:52.820
It's Achillesphere. Oh, okay ready

49:57.380 --> 49:59.380
Oh music is good too

49:59.860 --> 50:04.820
Thunder is that thunder thunder thunder cats

50:05.620 --> 50:07.620
Zeus

50:07.700 --> 50:08.980
Okay

50:08.980 --> 50:12.020
In the name of Hades Olympus. I accept this message

50:12.580 --> 50:14.740
Why do I have to say the name of Hades if I'm mad at my dad?

50:15.860 --> 50:17.860
Hey, what's up? It's me

50:18.900 --> 50:24.820
Look your father's always been rather difficult. I want to voice acting this game so bad. Just make me a nymph

50:25.460 --> 50:27.460
Where you belong? You're on Olympus

50:27.700 --> 50:30.340
And to help you on your journey have my blessing

50:32.180 --> 50:34.180
Sick

50:36.260 --> 50:38.260
I'm assuming I should pick the rare one

50:41.780 --> 50:46.980
There there's a buy one get one sales on the surface and he needs to get some new shoes

50:48.740 --> 50:50.740
All of the art

50:54.260 --> 50:56.260
He has a little nymph

50:56.740 --> 51:02.180
Technically could beat this game on your first run, but it's definitely not the intent of the developers. You were going to die a lot. Gotcha

51:05.220 --> 51:09.860
Zagreus's name Zagreus name doesn't hold much sway in Olympus. I imagine

51:10.980 --> 51:12.980
Isn't Hades also the name of the underworld?

51:16.580 --> 51:21.060
No all up to me this one's rare

51:23.780 --> 51:25.780
I kind of want the rare one

51:26.260 --> 51:28.260
Okay

51:30.340 --> 51:36.180
Lord uncle Zeus lending his support never thought I'd see the day or night whenever

51:36.820 --> 51:38.820
Oh, no, it's ended too

51:38.820 --> 51:40.820
Ah, oh

51:40.980 --> 51:42.980
Oh, oh fuck. I wasn't paying attention

51:44.020 --> 51:48.020
I don't where's my oh, there's my sword. I have to like summon it into the shit

51:50.180 --> 51:51.140
Shoe

51:51.140 --> 51:54.340
There's blood in the pit. No way to patch up. We've got to keep going

51:54.660 --> 52:00.420
Why does his voice sounds familiar his voice sounds like the narrator from just

52:01.380 --> 52:03.380
Slay slay the princess. That's

52:05.140 --> 52:07.140
I'm so sure that it's him

52:08.020 --> 52:10.820
The underworld of lord Hades. Please somebody look that up

52:10.900 --> 52:16.180
It is a guy who voices Zagreus the same guy that voices the narrator and slay the princess

52:18.660 --> 52:20.660
Good thing i'm not dead

52:20.660 --> 52:22.500
Uh

52:22.500 --> 52:24.500
Sure

52:27.620 --> 52:31.780
What is it now what the fuck is that little skulls?

52:37.700 --> 52:40.020
Is there a lock-on ability because I would like that

52:42.420 --> 52:43.700
Right

52:43.700 --> 52:47.460
Oh, I can blow the candles out and then they read that. Oh, man

52:47.540 --> 52:51.220
I saw that coming from a mile away, but I stepped on it anyways. Ow

52:53.220 --> 52:55.220
Ow

52:56.820 --> 52:58.820
Okay

53:01.860 --> 53:04.260
I'm not good at this game. That's for sure

53:07.860 --> 53:09.860
I'm gonna die again

53:11.060 --> 53:12.900
Will that be all?

53:12.900 --> 53:15.780
I gotta keep something back home. Do I get some health?

53:17.700 --> 53:19.700
Please

53:20.340 --> 53:23.400
Nope, it's not. Oh, they they sound the same

53:35.860 --> 53:38.260
Yeah, I got a dash more

53:40.340 --> 53:44.340
He's only voices. Oh, okay. Gotcha. Gotcha. I uh, I forgot something

53:44.580 --> 53:45.940
I

53:45.940 --> 53:49.140
Call my hair is like red for a second. Sorry. I forgot something

53:50.340 --> 53:51.380
What's up?

53:51.380 --> 53:55.940
Oh, one of those wretched louts just killed you dead that time those mean old slappy guys

53:56.980 --> 53:58.980
Shut up

54:01.940 --> 54:03.940
Uh, oh, what are you?

54:05.860 --> 54:07.940
Some sort of special offer for me my good shade

54:08.660 --> 54:10.660
Okay

54:16.820 --> 54:21.460
I like how I'm just approving this and my dad doesn't care. I don't know what these mean

54:23.460 --> 54:26.100
Oh, this game is a lot more intense than I thought it was

54:33.860 --> 54:35.860
Okay

54:36.180 --> 54:38.980
I can change the I can decorate

54:40.740 --> 54:44.740
I like I was just like a little shade in the ring hard hats. That's so funny. Hi dad

54:51.620 --> 54:55.060
I am the prince of uh

54:56.900 --> 54:58.900
What's it called

54:59.940 --> 55:01.940
Home decoration

55:05.940 --> 55:08.420
One whose responsibility is to work on this house

55:09.220 --> 55:14.900
The who shall pay for everything my subjects here demand. I do not know he voices with zag and hades

55:15.620 --> 55:17.300
really

55:17.300 --> 55:19.700
They don't sound the same. He's very good voice actor

55:21.860 --> 55:23.860
A lot of depth

55:23.940 --> 55:29.140
You can stun the red health enemies like that guys. I'm not gonna listen to any of you. I hope you know that right now

55:29.700 --> 55:32.180
You think I'm gonna remember that I don't even remember how to play

55:33.140 --> 55:36.260
I can't remember what the attacks are half the time

55:43.860 --> 55:49.700
Some are just visual novel you have to read descriptions very difficult roguelikes with dark souls of a difficulty really

55:51.620 --> 55:56.020
All right, you're trying to guilt to me into funding the exorbitant furnishings you desire

55:56.740 --> 56:01.380
Perhaps once we are finished with repairs for all the carnage you have sown throughout my realm

56:01.940 --> 56:05.780
Then we might finally have time for all the needed renovations that have piled up

56:06.340 --> 56:08.340
Okay, nice

56:09.460 --> 56:12.420
Cool. Hi dicks darkness guide you child

56:12.980 --> 56:16.020
You have outgrown this house of that. I am now certain

56:16.820 --> 56:18.820
I won't forget your next size

56:18.980 --> 56:21.860
I like how we're talking like I'm not gonna be back in like five minutes

56:22.740 --> 56:26.820
Do I need to I didn't catch anything so I don't really need to look in the mirror

56:29.540 --> 56:31.380
I should go

56:31.380 --> 56:33.380
Oh, so if I oh

56:33.380 --> 56:35.380
Okay, there we go

56:35.780 --> 56:37.780
Koran oct the heart seeker

56:38.100 --> 56:40.100
Let's deal some depth

56:40.180 --> 56:42.180
Over here. What the

56:42.660 --> 56:44.660
Hold

56:46.740 --> 56:48.740
Whoa

56:49.380 --> 56:54.340
Dr. Luke Edgar von Kleis tipped one dollar and fifty cents I heard again

57:09.220 --> 57:11.220
This is weird

57:11.620 --> 57:13.620
Oh

57:15.060 --> 57:18.900
I almost felt that I like guys just hanging out

57:20.660 --> 57:22.660
Carl Knox, that's a badass name

57:25.460 --> 57:27.460
But I like the sword

57:30.500 --> 57:37.540
It's skelly best character can I talk to him place? He got your boy. Oh name skelly has it going but enough with the smart talk already

57:37.540 --> 57:40.500
I'm here to do a job. So let me have it. Give me everything you got

57:42.020 --> 57:45.540
I don't remember having you on payroll mate. Who's your supervisor?

57:47.300 --> 57:49.300
Wow, the boy's acting so good

57:50.260 --> 57:52.260
Just try and beat it out of me

57:52.740 --> 57:54.340
If you insist

57:54.340 --> 57:55.620
um

57:55.620 --> 57:58.420
Are you like a sucker for pain?

58:07.460 --> 58:09.460
What was the other attacks I could do

58:12.180 --> 58:20.580
That's a volley that's pretty cool. Whoops. Oh, is I not supposed to kill him?

58:23.300 --> 58:27.060
I got you pretty good. Oh, you made me nervous dude. I thought I killed you

58:29.220 --> 58:34.420
And you're just a sucker for pain, aren't you? It doesn't really matter though. You think somebody would patch this window up

58:34.660 --> 58:42.100
The bow makes fights much easier dash around kite the enemy's lead is fine. Okay

58:47.540 --> 58:53.540
Oh Logan Cunningham voices Hades with four voices ag and skelly. Yeah, I could tell he voices skelly. I could I could hear that

58:55.140 --> 58:59.700
Can you feel pain if he's only bones? Well, he looks like he has some sort of like stuff on him

59:01.300 --> 59:03.300
Again

59:04.580 --> 59:09.620
By the power of who's next like a Daedalus hammer

59:11.140 --> 59:13.140
Is this gonna be

59:13.700 --> 59:15.540
Let me guess

59:15.540 --> 59:17.620
Let me guess

59:17.620 --> 59:20.020
What's that one guy that married Aphrodite?

59:21.540 --> 59:25.300
Enchantments for my weapon. Oh, no, it's just a Daedalus hammer. Okay

59:28.100 --> 59:32.260
I thought it was gonna be called as Daedalus because I know like Daedalus Icarus blah blah blah

59:32.900 --> 59:37.860
I'm talking about. I thought they're just calling whatever one of the what's the guy's name

59:41.940 --> 59:43.940
Their attack fires two shots at my son

59:46.340 --> 59:48.340
Oh, that sounds a sense

59:51.860 --> 59:53.860
Like

59:54.340 --> 59:56.340
I was crazy good too bad. I'm gonna

59:58.500 --> 01:00:00.500
Whoa

01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:03.380
Oh my god

01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:11.220
Ouchy, uh, I did it. Yeah, I see more. I did it

01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:16.820
If that's just thank you

01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:19.860
Thank you. Who's here?

01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:21.940
Grimstones

01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:23.940
Ah crystals

01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:27.300
Oh, what the hell I'm stuck

01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:31.060
I like how they can just move through stuff, excuse me

01:00:35.140 --> 01:00:37.140
Yeah

01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:41.780

I'm an astrology girl. You can't hurt me

01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:56.580
I'm already almost dead what I wouldn't give a say what do these mean?

01:00:57.940 --> 01:00:59.940
I

01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:05.860
This is hard. This is arrow. I don't know. I'm gonna go to the thing. I don't recognize

Alrighty, all right, don't step on those motherfucking things. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I missed

01:01:19.780 --> 01:01:24.180

No

01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:30.260
Ow

01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:32.500
Ow, ow, ow

I'm gonna die. No, I just started

01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:38.740
No

01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:41.300
Oh god

01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:46.020
Yeah, yeah, I'm attacking like I have the sword, but I don't

01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:52.820
Oh

01:01:54.740 --> 01:01:56.740
I'm not good at this

01:01:57.300 --> 01:02:05.060
Hmm had to come back for something right quick

01:02:11.380 --> 01:02:13.380
Don't talk to me

01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:16.260
I probably have to talk to you

01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:18.980
I'm embarrassed

01:02:19.780 --> 01:02:25.460
What you're back already. Hey, my list says that you barely leave me alone. Hypnos

01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:29.060
I didn't feel bad. I'm not good. I'm I'm learning

01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:31.940
What this how goes the chains?

01:02:33.380 --> 01:02:37.540
Oh, I like they're just chatting. They're chatting about how I died

01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:47.380
Skelly what's up, honey showed up shut up

01:02:56.420 --> 01:03:00.660
Thank you. Hi Zeus. I didn't mean to press that

01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:06.100
We need to get a young man yours isn't by a fair right

01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:08.900
That's cool. Uh

01:03:09.460 --> 01:03:11.460
Especially because of the lightning bolt

01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:15.220
Oh, I like the electric shot

01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:20.180
I haven't been dashing a lot. I'm gonna do this one. Is my hair sticking up?

01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:24.900
So

01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:28.340
Oh

01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:31.380
Okay

01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:38.660
Oh, okay, then I need to grab my special back. Okay, I see

01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:42.020
All right, there's a key over here. That's cool

01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:47.060
Okay, I'm learning. Okay, don't step on these fucking things

01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:57.460
Uh

01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:07.220
Like I found a key cool a key to a weapon nifty

01:04:09.380 --> 01:04:13.940
Okay, so I can either talk to Zeus or is there another one?

01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:22.980
Like how my dashing is just echoes, okay

01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:29.140
Okay, so if I win I get to talk to Zeus again

01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:34.740
These ones I need to stay away from

01:04:42.180 --> 01:04:44.180
What the hell

01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:58.100
That worked

01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:05.540
Okay, I kind of ought to lock on so that's fine

01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:16.900
Okay, okay

01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:19.540
Oh

01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:25.940
Oh, that's probably we'll kill him. I probably need that

01:05:28.420 --> 01:05:32.260
What's this do I get like ambrosia?

01:05:35.780 --> 01:05:38.180
You either talk to Zeus or talk to Zeus

01:05:39.780 --> 01:05:42.100
Easy snipe. I'm a sneak bear

01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:44.980
Sneaky

01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:52.740
Oh god, at least you died from that mostly

01:05:56.820 --> 01:05:59.780
You stay away. Oh, yeah, you jump pretty far

01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:06.660
Oh, but then yeah, if you hit me you get more damage

01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:10.100
I'm just gonna back up

01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:15.860
All right, let's see. I don't know how this dashing hit. I don't know

01:06:17.860 --> 01:06:22.740
Oh, I can't shoot that. That's not an enemy. Ah, I'll turn to that. Oh, no, not you

01:06:24.340 --> 01:06:26.340
Um, I have one health

01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:30.980
Yeah

01:06:30.980 --> 01:06:32.980
Yeah

01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:35.060
I need to get out of this corner

01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:42.900
Oh, I don't know why I did that. I'm so stupid. I didn't mean to step on that

01:06:43.860 --> 01:06:45.860
No

01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:49.700
It locks onto their hipbox. Okay, that's good to know

01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:54.100
Oh blasted spank traps everywhere. Okay

01:06:55.620 --> 01:06:57.620
I like how I just talk about how I died

01:06:58.900 --> 01:07:02.900
Oh, what do you have to say? So you got steward via spike trap out there, huh?

01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:08.100
Oh, okay. I hypnos. I don't think I'm ever gonna talk to you again. Welcome home boy

01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:11.300
You're late. That's all right father

01:07:12.260 --> 01:07:16.260
I'm asked repeatedly for the construction of a sundial, but every time

01:07:16.340 --> 01:07:18.660
Why would you need a sundial if we're underground?

01:07:21.140 --> 01:07:24.740
Why would you need a sundial if we're underground?

01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:29.860
For all our sparring practice, there's no teacher like the real thing

01:07:30.660 --> 01:07:34.660
What why you're giving me your codex I can't please I insist

01:07:35.940 --> 01:07:37.940
I don't know what this means

01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:42.100
Oh

01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:45.780
Okay

01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:48.420
Oh

01:08:06.740 --> 01:08:10.340
I like the smug expression that hypnos has on his face

01:08:10.580 --> 01:08:19.780
What this what once was a small lounging area within the house of Hades now was sealed off in utter

01:08:20.340 --> 01:08:22.340
That's cool. So Chris destroyed the lounge again

01:08:28.820 --> 01:08:30.820
Or the aesthetic

01:08:31.780 --> 01:08:33.780
Hello

01:08:33.940 --> 01:08:35.940
I will get whatever that means

01:08:37.300 --> 01:08:39.300
there

01:08:39.780 --> 01:08:43.940
My nice whatever animal this is this doesn't look like a bear. It looks like a lion

01:08:44.740 --> 01:08:46.740
But it also looks like a lion bear

01:08:46.820 --> 01:08:48.820
lion avatar

01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:54.900
Hi skelly. What's up pretty quick in old boy. Oh just be sure to use that fancy dash of yours

01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:57.540
Yeah, you're right mad instead of standing still

01:08:58.660 --> 01:09:01.220
You're right. You should do that. Um

01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:04.740
This needs more keys to open

01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:08.340
Oh if I equip I get 20 percent more

01:09:09.620 --> 01:09:11.620
Should I do that?

01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:14.740
Should I do that? Is that a thing I should be doing?

01:09:15.940 --> 01:09:17.940
I'll do it

01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:25.300
Shut up I'll grab it

01:09:27.540 --> 01:09:29.540
Because I get bonus

01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:35.700
Okay, but for death's defiance, okay, I don't know what that is but sure

01:09:35.700 --> 01:09:40.100
Let's see what I can do with this sword

01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:45.140
Attack becomes a big chop. The deal is 90 base damage

01:09:48.420 --> 01:09:50.420
I don't know what that

01:09:52.820 --> 01:09:57.300
Uh, I don't have any obels so I am going to take this

01:09:59.780 --> 01:10:01.780
All tuned up

01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:06.500
You can cancel your attack animation with dashes good to know

01:10:08.660 --> 01:10:11.700
So let's see what? Yeah. Yeah

01:10:13.620 --> 01:10:18.740
Oh, yeah, this is really narrow. Um, I'm trying to think

01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:26.500
At my side

01:10:28.180 --> 01:10:30.180
Nifty nifty

01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:34.500
Oh

01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:40.340
I really killed that one over there

01:10:47.540 --> 01:10:49.540
Right away

01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:56.580
50 I can use this to unlock a weapon

01:10:58.100 --> 01:11:00.420
So I can either what does this one mean?

01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:07.220
Because this one I I'm assuming I talk to a guy. It's probably Artemis and then this one is what?

01:11:08.260 --> 01:11:10.420
Isn't that my symbol? I don't know

01:11:18.580 --> 01:11:20.260
Ah

01:11:20.260 --> 01:11:24.100
I need a any dash to the dash has a little bit of a cool down

01:11:25.380 --> 01:11:27.140
It's like

01:11:27.140 --> 01:11:29.140
I got two second cool down

01:11:29.140 --> 01:11:31.140
This means money

01:11:31.540 --> 01:11:33.540
Money money money

01:11:33.860 --> 01:11:35.860
Must be funny

01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:38.260
Interest man. Well, do I go here then?

01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:43.540
Is money is important should I get monies?

01:11:46.020 --> 01:11:48.660
Did I do I need monies at this early stage?

01:11:49.780 --> 01:11:52.180
Or would it be worth it to talk to whatever god?

01:11:54.260 --> 01:11:56.260
I said because it's eagle

01:11:56.660 --> 01:12:00.580
I'm assuming this will be for like cosmetics and stuff for the work whatever

01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:03.140
For the contractors

01:12:05.380 --> 01:12:07.380
Can't die they die first

01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:10.580
You don't hold on to the money if you die

01:12:14.180 --> 01:12:18.580
So then how do I get back to the hub if I can use it if I can't use it

01:12:18.820 --> 01:12:21.380
I thought I only get back to the hub if I die

01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:25.060
Booms are better talk to the god. Okay

01:12:26.420 --> 01:12:28.420
I'll probably die

01:12:29.380 --> 01:12:31.380
Money is run dependent good to know

01:12:39.380 --> 01:12:41.380
Oh, I meant to run away

01:12:45.940 --> 01:12:50.340
I'm trying to run but I'm not running pressing the wrong button to run

01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:54.740
Ow, I don't like these guys

01:12:59.380 --> 01:13:01.380
Yeah

01:13:18.820 --> 01:13:20.820
Let's keep spamming that

01:13:21.140 --> 01:13:23.140
Hello

01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:28.100
Yeah, I was gonna say

01:13:28.180 --> 01:13:32.340
I'm like does it all also shoot arrows because the sisters are

01:13:36.100 --> 01:13:39.300
Oh, I love her design look at her little owl friends

01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:45.460
Thanks Artemis

01:13:47.060 --> 01:13:49.060
Oh

01:13:51.140 --> 01:13:53.140
Dash strike

01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:01.700
Maybe this will be helpful the hunter dash

01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:06.340
Although because I already have

01:14:12.980 --> 01:14:14.980
Hmm

01:14:14.980 --> 01:14:17.940
Innovation money is different as a different currency. Oh, okay

01:14:19.380 --> 01:14:22.580
It's the biabilities. Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. Good to know

01:14:23.940 --> 01:14:25.940
She's the crit lady

01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:28.900
Crit damage

01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:34.900
Here

01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:36.900
Hmm me me me me me

01:14:37.460 --> 01:14:40.340
He me me me me me me. What are you guys's suggestions?

01:14:41.620 --> 01:14:46.900
No bad abilities. All right. I'm gonna go with the dash because I feel like I'm gonna try to utilize dash more

01:14:47.060 --> 01:14:49.700
The hunt sounds like good company to keep. Why do I have a giant book?

01:14:50.580 --> 01:14:54.020
Oh, damn. I love all the fucking art in this game

01:14:55.940 --> 01:14:57.940
Oh

01:15:03.940 --> 01:15:05.940
Well, I would have done option one had I known

01:15:14.660 --> 01:15:16.660
Okay, that actually cancels it out

01:15:22.580 --> 01:15:24.580
Ow

01:15:26.260 --> 01:15:28.260
Oh

01:15:31.780 --> 01:15:33.780
I hate these things

01:15:40.820 --> 01:15:43.940
Oh, I walk I keep thinking that's an enemy, but it's the thing

01:15:45.780 --> 01:15:47.140
Okay

01:15:47.140 --> 01:15:49.380
Yeah, I gotta learn how things stack on each other

01:15:50.420 --> 01:15:52.420
One with my sword chop would have been good. Okay

01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:54.500
Ouch. All right

01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:58.580
Again, there are no bad options. This is not the cash for this. What even lied to you

01:16:00.260 --> 01:16:02.260
Oh, what's up?

01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:11.460
Are you just gonna tell me how I die each time such a dignity for my own kin shut up dad. I'm it's not a face

01:16:12.020 --> 01:16:15.860
Achilles, is it really true that Cerberus ripped the lounge up right after I left?

01:16:16.900 --> 01:16:18.900
I only wish you could have seen it lad

01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:23.060
The place looked like a vineyard after typhoon. Your lord father was livid

01:16:23.700 --> 01:16:28.020
But he never gets so angry with the doll. No, I wonder what became Medusa

01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:32.420
She's always worried father's going to fire her even without something like that. Is that Medusa?

01:16:36.100 --> 01:16:38.100
Where's my dog

01:16:38.900 --> 01:16:43.700
Cerberus must be asleep somewhere. Maybe this is my room. Well, that was quick

01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:46.260
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

01:16:46.260 --> 01:16:49.700
Lucky, I've got other family be careful whom you give your trust

01:16:50.580 --> 01:16:52.580
My brother's frolic on Olympus

01:16:55.860 --> 01:16:57.860
Oh

01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:02.180
What the heck who is that

01:17:06.820 --> 01:17:08.820
Is that Medusa's head

01:17:12.020 --> 01:17:15.540
I uh just wanted to say don't bother picking up my room today

01:17:15.940 --> 01:17:18.180
I'm headed out for a while. She's a cleaning lady

01:17:23.300 --> 01:17:25.300
Oh my god, I love her voice

01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:27.940
What

01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:30.500
She just flew up to nowhere

01:17:31.540 --> 01:17:33.860
Hemnos is the biggest back seating little brother

01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:38.820
I like Medusa. Dusa is fun to speak

01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:41.780
I I um

01:17:41.780 --> 01:17:43.780
I have to clean the rafters

01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:46.660
Hello

01:17:48.580 --> 01:17:50.580
Oh

01:17:51.620 --> 01:17:53.620
Why do you look so upset

01:17:54.100 --> 01:17:58.500
A commemorative board adorns one of the stoic walls within the lounging area

01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:02.740
Celebrating it won't ever see my face up on that wall. I who is that?

01:18:02.820 --> 01:18:06.020
I want to know who that is on the wall for employee of the month

01:18:07.540 --> 01:18:09.860
And he adjusts my booty cheek is getting sore

01:18:10.820 --> 01:18:15.940
What are these things on the ground are they supposed to be chairs

01:18:17.940 --> 01:18:21.380
These are so weird. I just clipped through them greetings chef

01:18:23.620 --> 01:18:25.620
Can I ask you for food?

01:18:26.820 --> 01:18:32.500
Look at these little guys. I like how they disappear when I walk with them. Does the chef disappear? No, the chef is solid

01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:34.500
What about you you disappear?

01:18:35.700 --> 01:18:37.700
Can I steal some fish and bread

01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:43.540
This game is so nice relaxed no time to rest. Oh, I'm all fuck you then never mind

01:18:45.860 --> 01:18:47.860
I like how there's a freaking lounge

01:18:49.380 --> 01:18:51.780
Hi though your journeys take you elsewhere

01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:54.900
Thanks grandma

01:18:57.460 --> 01:18:59.460
That's Fred

01:19:00.340 --> 01:19:02.340
Oh it's Cerberus's hair. Oh

01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:08.820
So I've already expected Cerberus to be in my room like sleeping on my bed or something. Um

01:19:10.820 --> 01:19:15.860
I don't think I have anything. Yeah, I only have two death defines

01:19:18.180 --> 01:19:20.180
Oh, okay

01:19:22.820 --> 01:19:24.820
That's good to know. Yeah, I'll save for that

01:19:25.540 --> 01:19:27.540
Oh

How's it going? What's up skelly? Hey pal watch where you throw those bloodstone things at yours you drop them

You go pick them up. You understand

01:19:35.460 --> 01:19:37.540
I'm just saying generally from the midsection since

01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:40.340
Okay, that makes sense

01:19:40.340 --> 01:19:42.580

01:20:24.900 --> 01:20:28.820
Release while flat what is while flashing mean

01:20:30.660 --> 01:20:32.660
Cerberus should say like the cats

01:20:33.940 --> 01:20:35.940
Uh

01:20:45.060 --> 01:20:48.500
Oh, oh, it's a timing thing

01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:54.100
Gotcha, okay. I'm not gonna ever time that properly

01:20:55.060 --> 01:20:57.060
Again

Dionysus question mark. Is that a ball of wine? What the heck is this? I can't even tell what the symbol is

01:21:11.220 --> 01:21:13.620
People having a good time. Well, sure then

01:21:15.780 --> 01:21:17.780

Oh my god, he's gorgeous

01:21:20.740 --> 01:21:25.700
You've been saving you a spot. Let me see what I can do. I love this design the purple

01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:30.820
It's like I don't must remind me of like male Azura because of the purple

01:21:31.780 --> 01:21:35.060
Oh, my character designs are so gorgeous

01:21:35.940 --> 01:21:38.500
Wow, look at the grapes. Oh my god

01:21:39.780 --> 01:21:41.780
He is like a little pine cone staff

01:21:42.900 --> 01:21:44.900
That's so cool

01:21:45.860 --> 01:21:47.860
I

01:21:49.540 --> 01:21:53.460
Pack inflicts hangover what is a hangover

01:21:58.260 --> 01:22:00.260
Is that like a stun like they get like

01:22:02.820 --> 01:22:06.500
Like some keeps taking down. Oh, okay stacks. So it's almost like poison

01:22:07.380 --> 01:22:14.580
This seems like it's a airy aoe

01:22:18.580 --> 01:22:25.140
We call the pantheon for a reason she bx Dionysus fan fix it coming. No, no

01:22:28.260 --> 01:22:30.260
It's a debuff. Yeah

01:22:32.340 --> 01:22:34.980
Drunken strike I just turned into broccoli

01:22:35.060 --> 01:22:37.060
I can't wait to see

01:22:38.580 --> 01:22:40.580
More characters

01:22:41.060 --> 01:22:46.420
I'm like very excited because everybody's gorgeous and just the art is so beautifully drawn

01:22:52.260 --> 01:22:57.380
Yes, yeah, I was at the beginning of the stream I was reading that they're almost essentially the same person

01:22:58.820 --> 01:23:02.900
They're like two sides at the same point. Um

01:23:03.460 --> 01:23:05.460
I really honestly Zag's

01:23:07.140 --> 01:23:08.580
design

01:23:08.580 --> 01:23:11.700
Really interests me because I'm wondering what's going up with this heterochromia

01:23:13.540 --> 01:23:17.220
I wonder if that's like a stylistic choice or has some purpose or meaning to it

01:23:18.420 --> 01:23:22.500
I didn't see what color I don't think Dionysus like had a true eye color in this art

01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:26.100
Because it would be cool if they gave like Dionysus like the same

01:23:27.220 --> 01:23:30.020
Thing but swapped to just acknowledge that connection

01:23:30.980 --> 01:23:35.380
I think you go for the three I was thinking about going for the three

01:23:36.900 --> 01:23:38.900

01:25:21.940 --> 01:25:29.540
Oh, let's go talk to Poseidon. Well, I figured that out. Thanks. Not thanks to you, dude. Um

Uncle number two. It's got to be

01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:16.500

Looks like I caught a big one the power of the seas should be of help. Yeah, baby. Yeah

01:27:46.740 --> 01:27:51.460
In Greek mythology Poseidon is the biggest man who are in a show. What are you talking about? That's Zeus

01:27:52.980 --> 01:27:54.980
Zeus is a man whore

01:27:57.380 --> 01:27:59.380
In my opinion

01:28:00.340 --> 01:28:02.980
Zeus just great juice boxes people a lot actually

01:28:04.260 --> 01:28:06.260
Yeah

01:28:08.980 --> 01:28:10.980

01:29:24.500 --> 01:29:26.500
Oh be a bun goddess

01:29:31.140 --> 01:29:37.860
I could be like one of Aphrodite's daughters because like, um, I think in like, uh,

01:29:39.140 --> 01:29:42.420
What is it? What mythology mythology?

01:29:44.020 --> 01:29:45.620
Ishtar

01:29:45.700 --> 01:29:47.700
Is like

01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:54.020
She's like I forget which version but she's she's not Aramaic. It's not Hebrew

01:29:54.980 --> 01:30:02.180
I forget but she her symbols. That's where uh, Easter comes from her symbols are the agon or rabbit

01:30:02.660 --> 01:30:04.660
and they just mix the

01:30:05.540 --> 01:30:08.980
Spring equinox and Easter so that the Christians would be happy

01:30:10.260 --> 01:30:12.500
Maybe I could be like her

01:30:13.460 --> 01:30:19.700
Because she has a fertility goddess as well and then me and Azur can be fertility goddesses together

01:30:21.620 --> 01:30:23.620

01:33:05.460 --> 01:33:07.460

The jam comes back to me father. Well

01:35:27.140 --> 01:35:29.620
All right, I like AoE stuff. That's my favorite

I like how they put the weirdest pitch on her

01:35:52.100 --> 01:35:54.100
Like what why did they

01:35:54.900 --> 01:35:59.300
Why did they make her voice like that? I like it. Don't get me wrong

01:36:00.100 --> 01:36:03.300
But the voice changer maybe the voice changer is supposed to be obvious

01:36:11.220 --> 01:36:14.420
Honestly, I feel like Dusa is voiced by hypnos the same person

01:36:18.980 --> 01:36:20.980
Get on it hypnos

01:36:23.780 --> 01:36:25.780

She's the goddess of starting your stuff

01:59:40.260 --> 01:59:43.620
Aphrodite and Hades related uh technically since

01:59:45.700 --> 01:59:47.300
Hades

01:59:47.300 --> 01:59:49.060
since it's

01:59:49.060 --> 01:59:51.540
I know Aphrodite was born from the sea

01:59:54.180 --> 01:59:55.860
But

01:59:55.860 --> 01:59:58.580
I forget I Poseidon not Poseidon. Um

02:00:00.180 --> 02:00:03.220

I could buy all of these

02:00:12.260 --> 02:00:14.260
Should come in useful

02:00:16.180 --> 02:00:18.180

02:00:56.660 --> 02:00:58.660
That was hard

02:01:00.180 --> 02:01:03.540
I believe you're collabing with real greek gods. I know it's really cool

02:01:04.500 --> 02:01:06.500
Poseidon told me

02:01:07.780 --> 02:01:09.780
Oh, that's cool

02:01:09.940 --> 02:01:12.340
And reveal her. Oh, she oh, that's so cool

02:01:14.020 --> 02:01:21.700
Yeah, I can't wait. It's so funny. Um back when I was rena. I did a I was telling Poseidon this I did a watch along of

02:01:23.060 --> 02:01:26.020
Their reviews again, I was like a small indie so it's not like anybody

02:01:26.500 --> 02:01:28.020
It wasn't like a sponsored thing or anything

02:01:28.580 --> 02:01:31.540
And I really love Poseidon's design and I loved her

02:01:32.420 --> 02:01:34.420
Visual novel debut thing

02:01:35.860 --> 02:01:38.820
And I remember pretending to respond to like

02:01:39.620 --> 02:01:40.980
Her questions

02:01:40.980 --> 02:01:47.060
It was goofy. It was funny. So it's really cool full circle that actually gets to hang out with her. I'm very I feel very lucky

02:01:47.780 --> 02:01:49.460

02:01:49.460 --> 02:01:53.220

Yes, that's how fast I read I just look at it and it's red

02:02:25.620 --> 02:02:27.620
Hey, what's up?

02:02:31.700 --> 02:02:37.060
Hell as you once did Achilles though doubtless many of the shades who stand against me first arrived in Tartarus because

02:02:37.940 --> 02:02:39.780
that's funny

02:02:39.780 --> 02:02:43.700
It's weird because Achilles looks like an old band from far away, but

02:02:44.260 --> 02:02:48.420
I can't really tell let's see this face. I feel like this is like a teleportation thing

02:02:49.140 --> 02:02:51.140
um

02:02:51.620 --> 02:02:53.620
Where's my dog?

Enhancement some part are artifact ever shifting on the road

02:03:04.820 --> 02:03:09.140
Okay, you ever shifting chambers of the underworld ought to be a little livelier with this

02:03:10.100 --> 02:03:14.260
You are distracting me. I'm not doing anything dad. Chill out

02:03:17.540 --> 02:03:20.500
Oh, I can get rid of the clumps of fur. That's funny

02:03:23.780 --> 02:03:25.780
I

02:03:27.300 --> 02:03:31.860
Was repair so there's repair and decor

02:03:33.780 --> 02:03:35.780
Okay

02:03:36.660 --> 02:03:38.660

Are you learning about the gospel truth? Yes, I am

02:04:03.860 --> 02:04:10.580

02:04:11.540 --> 02:04:13.540
It was so fun

02:04:15.540 --> 02:04:20.500
Voice actors work hard, I agree. They really do they do such a good job

02:04:20.820 --> 02:04:26.020
I want to be I seriously it's literally my dream to voice act in a game like this. That'd be so awesome

02:04:27.780 --> 02:04:30.340
Going from zero to hero in no time flat

02:04:31.540 --> 02:04:34.580
You want her to do dog things very busy stuff there

02:04:36.420 --> 02:04:38.420
Thank you next. How you doing Toma

02:04:40.580 --> 02:04:45.460
My hands are cold. My circulation's been bad. My shoulders been flaring up a lot

02:04:47.380 --> 02:04:48.820
And I

02:04:48.820 --> 02:04:51.620
Had to lift some boxes and so I strained it even more

02:04:52.580 --> 02:04:56.420
And it was really hard to lift and so but thankfully the thing that lets me

02:04:57.220 --> 02:04:59.220
drag stuff around the little

02:04:59.300 --> 02:05:03.700
Uh beach cart or buggy thing came in so I was able to bring my trash down

02:05:03.700 --> 02:05:06.020
But of course it was heavy and I had to bring it upstairs first

02:05:07.060 --> 02:05:09.060
That hurt

02:05:09.380 --> 02:05:12.260
Oh, let's do what's greater reflex. Oh

02:05:16.420 --> 02:05:18.420
Um

02:05:22.020 --> 02:05:24.020
Oh

02:05:27.220 --> 02:05:34.180
How's it going? Hi, if you don't know who I am I actually be cottonbump your favorite girl failure dumb extraordinaire

02:05:35.220 --> 02:05:36.980
um

02:05:36.980 --> 02:05:40.020
I'll spit on you hit to talk to her

02:05:40.820 --> 02:05:45.860
I hope you caught that in your mouth. Um, we're playing Hades. It's my first time playing. I really like it so far

02:05:45.940 --> 02:05:51.220
I didn't know how much I enjoy roguelikes ever since I played call the lamb. I love this one. I hope you guys had fun

02:05:51.460 --> 02:05:53.460
in tempestream

02:05:54.420 --> 02:05:57.380
You should talk to Poseidon's use some VA experience. She likes to give advice

02:05:57.460 --> 02:06:02.340
I definitely will talk to her about that. I'm great. I'm sipping ice coffee and reaching about wish again

02:06:02.660 --> 02:06:04.660
I still have to watch that movie

02:06:05.620 --> 02:06:10.900
I really want to watch it. Oh temple. Let me let me let me give you a little

02:06:11.860 --> 02:06:13.860
The hot girl wrench as they call it

02:06:17.460 --> 02:06:21.140
Hot girl wrench people keep talking and I can't catch up to your name

02:06:26.500 --> 02:06:28.740
Whoa, where'd my game go?

02:06:29.620 --> 02:06:33.460
Where'd my OBS go? Everything's ruined. It's just kidding

02:06:34.180 --> 02:06:38.020
Ah, my arm hurts. It hurts to flux my reef my little

02:06:38.500 --> 02:06:40.500
Fingies

02:06:40.500 --> 02:06:44.180
I've played pegglin. I love roguelikes and she tried Hades soon. I

02:06:45.060 --> 02:06:47.380
I've never heard of that one. What's that one about?

02:06:48.340 --> 02:06:54.260
You can rage together. Yeah, we can do a watch along with that. I heard I I remember seeing some stuff that I just like doesn't make any

02:06:54.260 --> 02:06:56.260
sense whatsoever

02:06:56.260 --> 02:06:58.980
Because it's like it's like the villain actually is more

02:07:00.180 --> 02:07:04.180
Understandable than like the main character is what I've heard

02:07:05.140 --> 02:07:07.940
Hot girl wrench. Yeah, you get the hot girl wrench

02:07:08.660 --> 02:07:15.220
Teiglin is very cool. I'll have to look at that one. I didn't know how much I like roguelikes, but I do. I like them a lot

02:07:16.500 --> 02:07:19.940
Oh and five keys I can how many keys do I have?

02:07:20.180 --> 02:07:22.180
How many keys do I have?

02:07:23.300 --> 02:07:25.300
No, she would tell me

02:07:27.620 --> 02:07:29.620
Need more keys

02:07:30.340 --> 02:07:34.580
Need more keys all set cool. Okay

02:07:38.500 --> 02:07:46.340
It's like peggle, but a roguelike. Oh, that sounds good. I can't unlock this don't have enough keys. I want the pitchfork

02:07:47.300 --> 02:07:49.300
Yay

02:07:49.380 --> 02:07:51.380
All right

02:07:51.700 --> 02:07:53.700
I like I like

02:07:53.860 --> 02:07:59.540
That yes, I am shut up. Um, I wonder what else shows up here. I wonder if I eventually get more

02:08:00.580 --> 02:08:02.420
What's that?

02:08:02.420 --> 02:08:06.660
The courtyard of the house of Hades is it's not that orderly really

02:08:08.020 --> 02:08:10.580
It's not I like how like lackadaisical he sounds

02:08:11.940 --> 02:08:13.940
Let's look at this beautiful view

02:08:14.020 --> 02:08:16.420
This will all that the way to the surface

02:08:19.140 --> 02:08:24.420
Like how it's running rivers of blood how fast is this like how far away is the surface?

02:08:25.460 --> 02:08:28.500
Like a hundred chambers. I bet it's something ridiculous that I'm never gonna get to

02:08:30.180 --> 02:08:32.180
One more time. No

02:08:35.620 --> 02:08:37.620
Poseidon come on. Let's go. Oh

02:08:39.300 --> 02:08:41.060
Aries

02:08:41.060 --> 02:08:43.060
This one was bound to show up. I guess

02:08:45.780 --> 02:08:50.660
Those areas look like spirit in you there. I have to say that's such a cool most intriguing

02:08:51.140 --> 02:08:57.700
Then you have no surprise to be honest. I'm very surprised with the amount and tell me all about of poc

02:09:01.540 --> 02:09:03.060
That there is in this game

02:09:03.060 --> 02:09:04.500
It's very cool

02:09:04.500 --> 02:09:07.540
But it's also just like they're also like very uniquely colored

02:09:07.620 --> 02:09:13.620
It's very like there's different shades because like a theme is a little bit more grayish purple and he's like

02:09:14.500 --> 02:09:16.500
more of a

02:09:18.420 --> 02:09:20.260
Yeah, red undertone brown

02:09:20.260 --> 02:09:25.220
It's very that I really like the diversity in their designs and they all are very true

02:09:26.340 --> 02:09:28.340
to like their lore the

02:09:28.900 --> 02:09:30.900
The the artist really took

02:09:31.860 --> 02:09:33.860
lots of care

02:09:34.100 --> 02:09:36.100
and um

02:09:36.260 --> 02:09:38.020
In designing uh

02:09:38.020 --> 02:09:44.420
These characters. I really really really like it. Also, uh, the helmet thing it reminds me. Oh

02:09:45.300 --> 02:09:47.060
What is it?

02:09:47.060 --> 02:09:49.060
Slade from

02:09:49.300 --> 02:09:51.620
From teen titans because a little thing on their thing

02:09:52.740 --> 02:09:55.700
Or like when robin this mini slade or whatever the heck

02:10:03.700 --> 02:10:05.700
Your attack inflicts doom

02:10:06.420 --> 02:10:08.420
I

02:10:12.580 --> 02:10:14.580
This is so cool

02:10:16.340 --> 02:10:20.980
Oh my god, I love the art. I'm just sharing a tag holding up Ares little thing. I'm a bobber

02:10:23.940 --> 02:10:30.820
Oh my god, it's freddy that game of Hades is epic intense and interesting. It really is you're so right freddy

02:10:32.340 --> 02:10:34.340
Oh

02:10:35.300 --> 02:10:37.300
It takes the first damage

02:10:43.540 --> 02:10:45.540
Huh

02:10:45.700 --> 02:10:47.700
So if I run

02:10:47.860 --> 02:10:49.860
It'll leave something behind me

02:10:50.900 --> 02:10:54.660
This one is is rare though. I might go with the rare one

02:10:58.340 --> 02:11:00.180
Hmm

02:11:00.180 --> 02:11:02.740
Yeah, let's try it the war is on

02:11:05.220 --> 02:11:07.220
Oh

02:11:10.100 --> 02:11:12.100
Ow, I'm already getting hurt

02:11:24.260 --> 02:11:26.260
I feel like I should have got a different one

02:11:34.340 --> 02:11:36.340
So

02:11:48.100 --> 02:11:50.100
Music is so good

02:11:53.940 --> 02:11:56.440
Gemstones sick

02:11:58.100 --> 02:12:03.380
I can talk to Ares again. I kind of want to keep stacking Ares's stuff because that would be cool

02:12:04.580 --> 02:12:06.580
Ah

02:12:13.380 --> 02:12:15.380
Nice, what is that?

02:12:17.700 --> 02:12:19.700
Oh, okay, it's like a little bomb thing

02:12:21.620 --> 02:12:24.340
Interesting interesting. I bet if I hit it

02:12:26.900 --> 02:12:29.140
Oh, I bet it would have damaged him if it was closer

02:12:34.580 --> 02:12:36.580
I

02:12:43.380 --> 02:12:46.580
Yeah, I do think I like being having a ranged weapon

02:12:51.060 --> 02:12:53.060
He did the music for the game

02:12:54.660 --> 02:12:56.660
Damn, that's cool

02:12:58.180 --> 02:13:00.180
My cast ends up lay

02:13:01.140 --> 02:13:03.140
Oh, I can just have them all

02:13:15.940 --> 02:13:18.740
Oh, this is a hard choice these are very good

02:13:21.540 --> 02:13:24.660
Ares is cracked. Yeah, that's why I was like, let me pick Ares again

02:13:26.500 --> 02:13:29.140
I feel like this would be good because this isn't

02:13:30.180 --> 02:13:32.180
This will be an aoe

02:13:32.660 --> 02:13:34.420
Not really

02:13:34.420 --> 02:13:36.420
Maybe I don't know

02:13:37.780 --> 02:13:41.780
Which one do you guys think I'm gonna take a sip of my drinky pool

02:13:51.460 --> 02:13:53.620
Too is pretty good for shred. Yeah

02:13:53.620 --> 02:14:03.060
Blade rift is fun. Let's try it. I want to see what it looks like

02:14:05.620 --> 02:14:11.220
Is that all you got to say about that violence? Is there another room? Okay, it looks like it's just this one

02:14:14.260 --> 02:14:16.260
Violence

02:14:17.220 --> 02:14:19.220
Oh

02:14:20.260 --> 02:14:22.260
Nifty, okay

02:14:23.220 --> 02:14:27.700
It's very slow though. I have to cast it very close. All right

02:14:32.340 --> 02:14:34.340
Now I hate these guys

02:14:42.820 --> 02:14:46.020
Where the fuck did you come from? Oh bounces back and forth

02:14:53.140 --> 02:14:55.140
Oh

02:14:59.140 --> 02:15:01.140
I might die at this one

02:15:02.340 --> 02:15:04.340
Yeah, I died at this one

02:15:11.220 --> 02:15:13.220
I like that it comes back to me

02:15:22.500 --> 02:15:24.500
Hmm

02:15:27.380 --> 02:15:34.420
I can get moneys or I can get moneys. I was hoping I would get something other than moneys

02:15:45.540 --> 02:15:47.540
Oh, they jump so far

02:15:52.260 --> 02:15:54.260
Oh

02:16:17.380 --> 02:16:20.980
The guards should fetch me something

02:16:22.340 --> 02:16:28.340
Does it fetch me something do is there a little oh usually would sit over here, but it's not there. Uh, okay

02:16:33.060 --> 02:16:35.560
If I fight fat men I might lose

02:16:52.980 --> 02:16:59.220
This is a good follow-up because then I can throw this and then I can just be like try to get that sweet spot and then

02:16:59.220 --> 02:17:01.220
Just keep shooting

02:17:03.380 --> 02:17:06.100
Okay, they don't get that far I can't see what I'm shooting at

02:17:07.540 --> 02:17:09.540
out

02:17:14.500 --> 02:17:16.500
I'm stuck I'm stuck

02:17:17.060 --> 02:17:21.060
Yeah, me really cornered there because I couldn't get out of there

02:17:22.660 --> 02:17:27.620
All right, oh my kid can I drop that oopsies?

02:17:30.420 --> 02:17:32.420
Who is this is that's a person

02:17:33.220 --> 02:17:38.100
What does that mean? So this is Poseidon and he'll give me some really good boost. I can see

02:17:39.780 --> 02:17:42.900
That I'm also at 10. What does this mean?

02:17:44.820 --> 02:17:46.820
I don't know that means

02:17:47.460 --> 02:17:52.660
You have met Aries the god of war lightning strikes

02:17:55.700 --> 02:17:59.300
Very intense. Oh, this is that guitar

02:18:02.180 --> 02:18:04.180
Hmm

02:18:06.260 --> 02:18:09.940
That's a shot. Oh, okay, then I'm just gonna go here. I don't really care about the shop that much

02:18:10.260 --> 02:18:12.260
Oh

02:18:15.620 --> 02:18:18.100
What the hell are these? Oh my god

02:18:22.660 --> 02:18:24.660
Oh, this is gonna be hard

02:18:39.940 --> 02:18:41.940
So

02:19:02.740 --> 02:19:04.740
Oh, does their stuff build back up

02:19:10.900 --> 02:19:12.900
Oh

02:19:21.140 --> 02:19:23.640
Oh, it's stupid fucking pillars in the way

02:19:40.660 --> 02:19:42.660
Oh

02:19:48.100 --> 02:19:50.100
Is he stuck

02:19:54.100 --> 02:19:56.100
All right

02:19:56.180 --> 02:20:00.180
It's by understanding you've been blessed already by one of my other nephews Aries

02:20:00.980 --> 02:20:03.540
As you can see not all of us are cut for the same cloth

02:20:04.180 --> 02:20:06.180
And thank the fates for that

02:20:06.180 --> 02:20:08.180
Oh, yeah, okay

02:20:09.220 --> 02:20:11.220
I think the dash would be good

02:20:12.660 --> 02:20:14.660
But this is good

02:20:19.380 --> 02:20:21.380
No good

02:20:22.340 --> 02:20:24.980
I can only use that once though. I would prefer the title dash

02:20:26.660 --> 02:20:30.900
Who felt that? Oh, yeah, that's good

02:20:35.220 --> 02:20:37.220
She's cracked not even true

02:20:56.740 --> 02:20:58.740
Let's come at even

02:21:08.180 --> 02:21:13.060
Oh, baby, see I I'm so glad I got that dash

02:21:15.620 --> 02:21:17.620
Who should I give this to

02:21:18.980 --> 02:21:21.540
A me is there anybody else?

02:21:22.020 --> 02:21:24.020
Okay

02:21:25.540 --> 02:21:29.220
That's the farthest I've come the aoe madam is so humble

02:21:31.780 --> 02:21:33.780
All right

02:21:37.860 --> 02:21:40.100
Actually, maybe if I can get them

02:21:48.420 --> 02:21:50.420
Aoe's just go to in this game

02:21:51.540 --> 02:21:53.540
So

02:22:21.940 --> 02:22:30.020
This is good choke point. I'm gonna kill this guy first

02:22:35.540 --> 02:22:37.540
Oh, damn it

02:22:46.820 --> 02:22:49.540
Oh, holy shit, okay, cool

02:22:52.180 --> 02:22:55.380
I love the dash the dash is so good

02:22:59.140 --> 02:23:02.900
Uh, should I get a key I'm gonna work on getting more of these

02:23:11.300 --> 02:23:15.620
Dad survive for 45 seconds

02:23:21.540 --> 02:23:23.540
Oh

02:23:37.860 --> 02:23:43.620
Oh, the dash is goaded. Oh, I couldn't even shoot in here. Oh

02:23:48.740 --> 02:23:50.740
Almost there

02:23:52.500 --> 02:23:54.500
I

02:23:56.020 --> 02:24:02.180
Literally just gonna dash a shit ton no for the best enough there we go

02:24:06.260 --> 02:24:08.660
Okay, I got money it's fine

02:24:10.340 --> 02:24:12.580
Sorry, I'm like so locked in I'm like this is fun

02:24:14.900 --> 02:24:16.900
Oh, I love this

02:24:22.340 --> 02:24:24.980
These are cool because I can just dash through them and they die instantly

02:24:31.060 --> 02:24:33.060
And then I can also

02:24:36.100 --> 02:24:38.100
Grab that back

02:24:51.540 --> 02:24:53.540
Oh

02:25:07.380 --> 02:25:09.380
I keep walking into those

02:25:21.540 --> 02:25:23.540
Hmm

02:25:24.820 --> 02:25:26.820
I'll get a key because last time

02:25:30.340 --> 02:25:32.340
This game is funny

02:25:36.580 --> 02:25:41.860
Oh god, oh, oh, I'm not gonna lose one

02:25:42.580 --> 02:25:44.580
So

02:25:50.180 --> 02:25:52.980
Oh, yeah, this is very hard

02:26:02.020 --> 02:26:04.020
Oh look ahead

02:26:11.860 --> 02:26:13.860
Oh

02:26:42.260 --> 02:26:44.260
Oh

02:26:48.420 --> 02:26:51.300
Bro this I need to any time I get a dash I'm getting a dash

02:26:53.300 --> 02:26:55.460
There's no way I'm getting I'm not getting a dash

02:26:56.420 --> 02:26:59.780
Uh, that's the bank and then I rather oh, there's nothing

02:27:04.500 --> 02:27:06.500
Okay, what does this do

02:27:06.500 --> 02:27:11.940
I don't sleigh foes quickly

02:27:25.780 --> 02:27:27.780
I don't know what I'm doing

02:27:37.220 --> 02:27:39.220
Oh

02:27:55.780 --> 02:27:58.100
This is fun, okay

02:28:01.220 --> 02:28:03.220
Cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool

02:28:07.060 --> 02:28:09.620
Nifty nifty

02:28:11.620 --> 02:28:13.620
Oh your tack fire

02:28:15.460 --> 02:28:17.460
Three shots and spread pattern

02:28:19.140 --> 02:28:22.820
Hades every day next week. No, we're gonna replay some Elden Ring

02:28:25.140 --> 02:28:28.900
I'm kind of wishing I waited to make my schedule because I would have thrown Haiti on the list

02:28:28.980 --> 02:28:30.500
Hades on the list

02:28:30.500 --> 02:28:33.220
Our time for our shoot by said three shots and spread pattern

02:28:36.900 --> 02:28:38.900
I

02:28:40.580 --> 02:28:42.580
Like the range

02:28:50.020 --> 02:28:52.580
This is pretty much my volley, but it's

02:28:54.820 --> 02:28:56.820
A little bit stronger

02:28:57.780 --> 02:28:59.780
This will chain it

02:29:00.260 --> 02:29:02.260
I would prefer the volley

02:29:03.380 --> 02:29:06.020
Because I don't know if I'll have three foes around me. So I don't know if there's

02:29:07.460 --> 02:29:09.460
A point

02:29:12.260 --> 02:29:18.580
Not to make it. No, but I don't think my manager appreciate me redoing my time schedule. What is that?

02:29:22.900 --> 02:29:27.060
Beyond the present chamber lies the outermost perimeter of Tartarus

02:29:27.780 --> 02:29:32.180
Promising terrifying dangers far beyond the underworld princess reckoning

02:29:33.140 --> 02:29:39.640
Okay, so I think I'm reckoned quite a bit. I'm assuming I'm getting out of Tartarus if I try if I go this one

02:29:41.460 --> 02:29:43.460
Okay

02:29:44.020 --> 02:29:46.020
Get ready to schmoove. All right, I thought so

02:29:49.780 --> 02:29:51.780
Well, this is awkward

02:29:52.740 --> 02:29:56.900
Pulse agris not one step further. Oh, she is hot

02:29:59.060 --> 02:30:01.060
Oh my god

02:30:02.180 --> 02:30:05.060
Mommy, sorry mommy and she has a whip

02:30:13.220 --> 02:30:16.580
Sorry, I'm literally just like dumbfounded right now. I can't I don't have anything to say

02:30:18.100 --> 02:30:21.060
I don't have anything to say. I'm just I'm just staring at her majesty

02:30:22.180 --> 02:30:26.100
She's a cute little nose ring going on. She's amazingly painted pink nails

02:30:28.980 --> 02:30:30.980
I just

02:30:32.340 --> 02:30:34.340
I may if she's a fury

02:30:36.020 --> 02:30:38.020
Oh my god

02:30:38.020 --> 02:30:39.540
I want her

02:30:39.540 --> 02:30:41.540
I want to furiously

02:30:42.500 --> 02:30:44.500
Eat her out

02:30:44.660 --> 02:30:51.540
It's the employee of the mom come on make it. Haven't we had more than enough of each other by now besides don't you have some place else to be

02:30:53.700 --> 02:30:57.540
Your father sent me all and all I'd rather be on your bad side than his

02:30:58.100 --> 02:31:02.260
Now you can turn back like a good little oh, I love her voice. Oh my god

02:31:03.460 --> 02:31:04.820
What'll it be?

02:31:04.820 --> 02:31:06.820
She's like whisper talking

02:31:06.820 --> 02:31:08.820
How don't it be?

02:31:08.980 --> 02:31:12.580
Your father sent me all in all I'd rather be on your bad side than his

02:31:13.060 --> 02:31:16.180
Now you can turn back a little peek a little good. I can't talk but yeah, you get it

02:31:16.580 --> 02:31:18.580
I'll have to go with the painful way

02:31:19.060 --> 02:31:22.740
A man after my own heart a man after my own heart

02:31:24.580 --> 02:31:26.580
Ma'am

02:31:27.940 --> 02:31:29.940
I

02:31:30.180 --> 02:31:32.180
How

02:31:33.380 --> 02:31:35.380
How did oh fuck I walked into that

02:31:36.820 --> 02:31:40.180
Ah, I'm so stupid walking into these don't think it's wrong with me

02:31:42.100 --> 02:31:44.100
Oh

02:31:49.380 --> 02:31:51.380
Oh, she is really high health

02:31:57.540 --> 02:31:59.540
Oh

02:32:21.220 --> 02:32:25.220
Oh god, oh god. Oh shit. Oh god. Oh shit fuck

02:32:27.620 --> 02:32:29.620
Oh

02:32:33.700 --> 02:32:35.940
Hell half no fury a little woman scorned

02:32:38.900 --> 02:32:42.180
Oh, oh god, I can dash and kind of be impervious for a bit

02:32:47.380 --> 02:32:49.380
I wish I had a super

02:32:50.580 --> 02:32:52.580
Oh

02:32:53.060 --> 02:32:55.060
Oh

02:32:56.580 --> 02:32:58.580
I'm like scared to get near her

They all still think I'm headed to join them on olympus. That's why they're helping me

Not everybody knows exactly how to give you pets and live to tell them right boy. Can I pet the other heads?

02:38:33.460 --> 02:38:37.140
Is that a thing because they always just come up on the side. Can I pet the other heads?

02:38:39.620 --> 02:38:43.140
Here boy, just as long as one of your three heads enjoys these pets. Okay

02:38:48.340 --> 02:38:50.340
What I can't pet my dog

02:38:50.500 --> 02:38:57.220
I got that dog in me. I just want to pet my dog. All right, uh, let's go in here

02:39:00.020 --> 02:39:02.020
And

02:39:05.860 --> 02:39:07.860
Where could I equip stuff?

02:39:09.380 --> 02:39:11.380
So I have 30

This one had the others in bite yikes

02:39:35.940 --> 02:39:39.300
If you flirt with hypnos, do you technically flirt with Thanatos too?

02:39:40.020 --> 02:39:42.020
Well, Thanatos is death

02:39:42.580 --> 02:39:44.020
He's sleep

02:39:44.020 --> 02:39:46.340
Are you flirting with sleep and death?

02:39:48.100 --> 02:39:50.100

02:39:51.860 --> 02:39:53.860

In the weapons area after the bedroom. Oh, that's right. You're right

02:40:15.140 --> 02:40:20.740
I want to kind of watch like how his beard is a symbol and the symbol also

02:40:21.300 --> 02:40:24.980
Is the pitchfork. What is he denying people doing like what is happening here?

02:40:28.580 --> 02:40:30.580
This guy has a little poop on his head

02:40:34.740 --> 02:40:37.540

What are they claiming? I don't know what's happening. I just want to watch it though. Oh, he's also shy

02:41:02.660 --> 02:41:04.660
Can I enter to Elysium?

02:41:05.540 --> 02:41:07.540
Oh

02:41:09.620 --> 02:41:14.660
Poop guy went in. Yay. Good for him. Oh, I can walk through all of them. That's so funny

02:41:14.980 --> 02:41:17.780
Okay, anyways, so that one wasn't too happy about it

02:41:18.580 --> 02:41:20.580
Good for good for poop head

02:41:24.980 --> 02:41:27.140
He's to have office hours for petitions

02:41:31.220 --> 02:41:33.220
Oh, he's like, please talk to me

02:41:34.180 --> 02:41:37.700
What was that? What was that tick-tock noise?

02:41:42.820 --> 02:41:45.220
You act as though this guard mode is some sort of lever

02:41:45.220 --> 02:41:49.060
I can simply switch at will if ever I wish to unlock my latent strength there, mate

02:41:50.020 --> 02:41:53.380
Damn zag is like really beautiful. His bone structure is

02:41:54.820 --> 02:41:57.780
All like is the world. Um, okay, uh

How many can I quit? Oh

02:42:17.780 --> 02:42:21.940
Cool. All right, so I should probably give stuff to the other characters as well

02:42:23.380 --> 02:42:25.380
Just so that I can

02:42:26.900 --> 02:42:28.900

02:42:47.940 --> 02:42:49.940
Oh

02:42:54.580 --> 02:42:56.580
Like this court system

02:42:56.580 --> 02:42:58.580
I

02:42:58.980 --> 02:43:05.460
Skeleton sounds like chief Wimbly from Simpsons. Oh, yeah, you're right. Jimmy's taking 10 more percent damage from the back

02:43:06.180 --> 02:43:08.180

And he's just putting put on the head and he's

Wait, boomy, lift up your face

02:44:57.140 --> 02:44:59.140
Please look up here

02:45:01.620 --> 02:45:09.060
Oh my god, there's Fia. Oh, this isn't working. You guys are not good. What is happening? Stop hitting each other

02:45:11.300 --> 02:45:13.300
I wanted to

02:45:13.620 --> 02:45:15.620
Why are you clawing my chair?

02:45:17.940 --> 02:45:19.620

02:45:19.620 --> 02:45:23.620
It was trying to oh, okay. You guys are just gonna fight. That's fine

02:45:26.180 --> 02:45:28.180
He likes his rubies

02:45:29.620 --> 02:45:32.500
Like just imagine like, you know when you like mush a cat's face

02:45:34.180 --> 02:45:36.980
That's what I do to boomy because boomy doesn't like his

02:45:37.540 --> 02:45:42.340
Uh body pet. He doesn't like like back scratchies or tummy scratchies or anything

02:45:42.740 --> 02:45:46.180
He only likes his head and his chin scratched and sometimes his chin

02:45:47.140 --> 02:45:51.460
And he may always makes I don't know where he got this from but he just makes a funny face

02:45:52.180 --> 02:45:54.180
When he gets his head pat

02:45:55.060 --> 02:45:57.700
Oh, you're doing it again now that I put my phone away

02:46:07.860 --> 02:46:08.980
I

02:46:08.980 --> 02:46:14.180
Suggested us take whichever weapon is 20% in the early game soon like all weapons quickly. Oh, okay

02:46:15.380 --> 02:46:21.860
I realize I've just been ignoring keys. I need to track down mochathonic keys. Uh, I only have one

02:46:23.700 --> 02:46:29.060
I've been I need to get more keys. Um, I'll get this one. No, but I like the bow. I'm shaving bow

02:46:30.020 --> 02:46:32.020
Like how I want to play

02:46:32.020 --> 02:46:34.020
Because I'm better with bow

02:46:34.820 --> 02:46:36.820
I'm a bow user

02:46:37.780 --> 02:46:39.780
All right areas Poseidon

02:46:41.140 --> 02:46:43.140
Hermes

02:46:46.020 --> 02:46:48.740
A bat wing it looks more like a bird wing, but okay

02:46:50.660 --> 02:46:54.180
It's batman batman picked up

02:46:57.940 --> 02:46:59.940
He's like the sunset

02:47:04.020 --> 02:47:06.020
Places to be

02:47:06.580 --> 02:47:08.580
I'm surprised I didn't say like

02:47:09.140 --> 02:47:11.700
Messenger of the gods. They just put god of swiftness

02:47:13.620 --> 02:47:17.540
Oh, and he has that little staff thing that I can't remember the name of that's such a

02:47:18.580 --> 02:47:22.180
I love his scarf. He literally looks like a sunset

02:47:22.900 --> 02:47:25.140
Like a little phoenix like he's fiery

02:47:26.420 --> 02:47:28.980
His little bag. There's a frog in his bag

02:47:29.700 --> 02:47:32.820
I love it

02:47:35.380 --> 02:47:37.380
That's so cool

02:47:41.700 --> 02:47:46.100
But probably not gonna be relevant blows around the fastest weapons to clear the game with specifically one of the blows

02:47:48.260 --> 02:47:51.620
Okay, is that a batman my friend? So you got that frog in him

02:47:52.580 --> 02:47:59.220
So I can be faster I can dodge automatically after I'm sturdy

02:48:03.940 --> 02:48:07.540
This would be cool if they could get that dash from Poseidon again

02:48:10.580 --> 02:48:18.180
My attack is faster. I kind of want the hyper sprint appreciate the lift lord. Hermes. Oh, oh, yeah, that's cool

02:48:19.140 --> 02:48:21.140
I like that

02:48:34.980 --> 02:48:38.580
He's a swifty I would be too

02:48:41.220 --> 02:48:44.260
Oh, okay, is that a chimera?

02:48:44.260 --> 02:48:46.260
Okay

02:49:02.340 --> 02:49:05.700
I got the timing for that right now I get the timing for it

02:49:14.420 --> 02:49:16.420
Yeah, that's not that's not hard to do

02:49:17.940 --> 02:49:25.620
Aw health is there another one? I want to get another boon. This might not be a good run at this rate. Oh, I love the little wee

02:49:30.580 --> 02:49:33.860
So if you do 10 floors, that's when you hit the boss, right? Where am I?

02:49:44.260 --> 02:49:46.260
Ow

I'm trying to attack and I can't

02:50:19.780 --> 02:50:22.260
Because I know they're not gonna stop unless I kill them

02:50:25.060 --> 02:50:27.560
This is not a good run now

02:50:30.340 --> 02:50:33.780
Need to press on that ought to keep me going for a bit

02:50:44.900 --> 02:50:46.900

Kind of want them to come closer to me

02:52:09.220 --> 02:52:12.180
So I don't have to worry about them rushing me

02:52:24.020 --> 02:52:29.140
Oh god, yeah should have dashed. I don't know why I'm not dashing

02:52:31.940 --> 02:52:34.580
Lady Artemis oh I can gift to her

02:52:39.780 --> 02:52:44.740
Lady Artemis, I hope that you'll accept this offering for all your kindness and support

02:52:46.820 --> 02:52:53.060
Hey, thank you for this really and I've just the thing to offer in return. Oh, she's so cute. It's just a gift, okay?

02:52:53.220 --> 02:52:58.420
She's just like it's just a gift. Don't even think about it. Okay. It's nothing bad. Whatever. It's nothing serious

02:52:59.140 --> 02:53:01.140
Lady Artemis you honor me

02:53:04.340 --> 02:53:07.140
Hey, how'd you get your hands on a nice bow like that?

02:53:08.100 --> 02:53:13.540
You take good care of corn out for me. So I can try it too once you're up here. I stole it for my dad

02:53:15.700 --> 02:53:20.980
I don't like those creatures either. They're so annoying. Yeah, they just like bum rush you. Okay. Your attack is stronger

02:53:26.900 --> 02:53:30.020
I'm gonna do my attack is stronger because I've been having to use that more

02:53:30.020 --> 02:53:32.020
I

02:53:34.900 --> 02:53:40.500
Haven't been using the volley as much. I'll do that the dead better hide

02:53:42.740 --> 02:53:45.780
I'm Zagreus aren't I something? Oh

02:53:56.500 --> 02:53:58.500
Yeah, I thought I could dodge that

02:54:00.020 --> 02:54:02.020
I

02:54:20.980 --> 02:54:23.620
Damn it. Oh, I forgot

02:54:24.580 --> 02:54:31.620
Oh as I fucked that up for myself. I hate these guys are my least favorite enemy in this game

02:54:37.700 --> 02:54:44.340
I want to prefer to save my what I need to do with my strat is I need to save my deft defied until I get to Megara

02:54:46.740 --> 02:54:51.060
At least I can talk to Zeus. Hopefully Zeus can give me something good because I would like an AOE

02:54:54.180 --> 02:54:56.180
Just great

02:54:57.060 --> 02:54:59.560
What the frick is this?

02:55:04.580 --> 02:55:09.460
Oh god, I'm stuck. I'm stuck. Oh god. Oh god. I don't like this at all

02:55:10.900 --> 02:55:13.220
Oh, oh lord Jesus

02:55:14.020 --> 02:55:16.020
Jesus christ. I

02:55:16.580 --> 02:55:18.260
Oh

02:55:18.260 --> 02:55:20.260
Oh, I can run across stuff. Oh sick

02:55:24.100 --> 02:55:26.100
Um

02:55:26.260 --> 02:55:28.260
Anyways

02:55:29.460 --> 02:55:35.780
Uh, I love having only three fucking health left. Sorry two health left. That's great

02:55:38.020 --> 02:55:40.020
Can I get a critical please?

02:55:40.740 --> 02:55:42.740
I should get a critical for one of the little guys

02:55:43.540 --> 02:55:45.540
What is happening?

02:55:48.340 --> 02:55:51.940
That run wasn't good because I didn't really get a lot of good boons to be honest with you

02:55:54.340 --> 02:55:56.340
Oh

02:55:57.060 --> 02:55:59.060
That blasted doomstone

02:56:00.340 --> 02:56:02.340
Hi Raina

02:56:06.020 --> 02:56:08.020
Are you gonna come snug

02:56:09.780 --> 02:56:11.780
I want to try to get to Megara again

02:56:13.700 --> 02:56:14.980
I'm stuck

02:56:14.980 --> 02:56:18.500
Raina hold on. I'm trying to put my blanket on my lap so you don't accidentally scratch me

02:56:19.220 --> 02:56:20.660
There you go

02:56:20.660 --> 02:56:28.820
Good lady. Yeah, I could pop a squat now. Hi sweetness. What do you want to hug? I can give you a hug. Oh hug time

02:56:31.620 --> 02:56:33.620
Hug to Raina

02:56:34.020 --> 02:56:39.460
Sorry, she's on my shoulder. She called it my lap and called it up my shoulder to give me a hug

02:56:41.620 --> 02:56:45.620
You smell stinky. Are you in a litter box? Wait

02:56:45.620 --> 02:56:47.620
Hmm

02:56:49.220 --> 02:56:52.660
She looks all offended that I'm sniffing her. I think I'm gonna

02:56:54.100 --> 02:56:56.100
Wipe you down because I think it's

02:56:56.420 --> 02:57:00.900
I think it's the medicine. She just smells like medicine because I've been giving her medicine

02:57:02.100 --> 02:57:04.100
Can you give me some medicine?

02:57:06.020 --> 02:57:08.020
Oh, my cat's food is about to go off

02:57:08.660 --> 02:57:14.900
Doomstone more like boo stone

02:57:16.900 --> 02:57:22.900
Little guys don't do damage. The big guy chains laser the small ones in fixed directions. Yeah, I think I figured that out

02:57:26.020 --> 02:57:28.020
That's why I was targeting him

02:57:29.620 --> 02:57:31.620
But thank you

02:57:38.020 --> 02:57:40.020
Hmm

02:57:43.060 --> 02:57:47.140
And boomi's not back on my desk boomi, can you lay down in the bed?

02:57:48.980 --> 02:57:54.500
Can you not try to attack my wires? I'm covered in cats right now. I have cat hair in my face from right up

02:57:57.780 --> 02:58:03.380
And she pulled my headphones out now I gotta stick my headphones back in

02:58:08.020 --> 02:58:10.020
Okay

02:58:14.020 --> 02:58:16.020
This I can't hear anything

02:58:20.340 --> 02:58:22.340
These headphones are nice

02:58:28.820 --> 02:58:32.500
The first time you give a book guys, you're telling me things that I've already figured out

02:58:32.500 --> 02:58:34.500
Oh

02:58:36.500 --> 02:58:39.940
Looks like you ran smack into the doomstone out in Tartarus think

02:58:40.580 --> 02:58:44.340
I'm no I'm dumb and blonde, but I'm not that dumb and blonde. How goes it?

02:58:45.380 --> 02:58:51.380
Why does this room feel weirder? I like the room got bigger. Your enemy is not the wretched dead and not your father

02:58:52.980 --> 02:58:54.980
The underworld itself

02:58:55.540 --> 02:58:58.500
Sorry, I'm reading was that there before?

02:59:03.380 --> 02:59:07.860
Hi dad go to your room. Oh, okay

02:59:11.380 --> 02:59:13.380
Who is that?

02:59:13.700 --> 02:59:16.900
Who is that? Oh cat's food is going off

02:59:19.060 --> 02:59:21.060
Let me help you get down this arena

02:59:21.780 --> 02:59:23.780
There you go

02:59:24.660 --> 02:59:26.660
Cat food dispenser my beloved

02:59:27.220 --> 02:59:36.820
Tip shields can block damage what? No, I can block damage with a shield

02:59:38.420 --> 02:59:42.980
No way bro. I had no idea you could rock damage with a shield

02:59:44.020 --> 02:59:50.260
Not that that's the purpose of a shield or anything. I had no idea. Holy crap. Thank you guys. I appreciate it

02:59:50.980 --> 02:59:55.380
Nix sometimes I get the impression the olympians look down on those of us born of the underworld

02:59:59.700 --> 03:00:03.460
The gods of mount olympus tend to think themselves above us child

03:00:04.580 --> 03:00:06.580
I can't imagine him otherwise

03:00:10.020 --> 03:00:14.820
All right, let's reflect. How am I looking?

03:00:15.540 --> 03:00:20.740
I'm going to save so I can have greater reflex

03:00:30.260 --> 03:00:34.180
Um, I still don't have enough keys. I haven't really ran into any keys

03:00:40.340 --> 03:00:42.340
Skelly I feel like you're up to something

03:00:44.820 --> 03:00:47.860
Leave it at that now. Let's see it break some of these bones, huh?

03:00:48.580 --> 03:00:54.100
It's kind of weird how much he wants you to hurt him like I know he gets paid for it, but like I'm good

03:00:55.140 --> 03:00:57.460
Is there anything? Uh, let me see

03:00:58.820 --> 03:01:00.820
That one looks interesting

03:01:03.220 --> 03:01:05.220
Oh

03:01:05.300 --> 03:01:07.300
Because then I can get really good crit stuff

03:01:08.500 --> 03:01:10.500
Cool cool cool. Nice

03:01:11.460 --> 03:01:18.660
It's actually a really cool boon. I will definitely try to find a nectar so I can give it to Poseidon because that would be probably really good

03:01:20.420 --> 03:01:23.860
Tip the number at the bottom left should be hitting through there. Okay, got it. Thank you

03:01:25.140 --> 03:01:28.340
That's gonna be I didn't know that before I thought that was just there for show

03:01:29.460 --> 03:01:34.100
Normally it's for killing things, but in your case it makes it even easier for me to hunt you down

03:01:35.140 --> 03:01:37.140
What are you gonna give me? What?

03:01:37.860 --> 03:01:41.780
It said it would give me rare stuff you fuck

03:01:58.020 --> 03:02:00.020
You lie to me

03:02:08.020 --> 03:02:16.020
Okay, at least I can get a key people time when they are killed. No, you're lying

03:02:18.500 --> 03:02:23.940
You're lying to me what the fuck I could have sworn there was another dude like in this corner over here

03:02:38.020 --> 03:02:40.020
I

03:02:41.620 --> 03:02:46.100
Got okay. I got attacks. I got oh sweet Daedalus

03:02:49.460 --> 03:02:51.460
I like this game

03:02:52.740 --> 03:02:54.740
Hi, how are you?

03:02:56.980 --> 03:03:01.060
I would give you hot girl wrench, but I'm killing skulls

03:03:04.180 --> 03:03:06.180
Give me a moment

03:03:08.100 --> 03:03:10.100
I

03:03:13.060 --> 03:03:15.460
Okay, this is like the choke point from before

03:03:18.740 --> 03:03:20.740
Ow

03:03:22.340 --> 03:03:24.740
I don't care about them. I just care about oh

03:03:27.220 --> 03:03:29.220
Come on. There we go

03:03:30.180 --> 03:03:40.660
Is bunny lady, that's me. I'm the bunny lady. How are you doing chill a dino has been spotted

03:03:45.060 --> 03:03:48.980
You're unvulnerable with that block up from that direction even may lays get drunk what

03:03:49.780 --> 03:03:53.700
Names are so you know their names. Just let you know since it's so well

03:03:54.020 --> 03:03:56.020
It is

03:03:58.900 --> 03:04:02.020
Yeah, I names what's a name I have no idea

03:04:04.900 --> 03:04:11.300
Monsters don't go to hell with their kills smack that bow with a hammer. What's the worst that could happen?

03:04:13.780 --> 03:04:15.780
The lady has been given a wrench

03:04:18.100 --> 03:04:23.460
It's just the edge I need okay, um whole attack shoot rapidly but I can't power shot

03:04:23.700 --> 03:04:25.700
No, I don't like that

03:04:26.980 --> 03:04:28.980
Holds

03:04:38.100 --> 03:04:40.100
I'm gonna charge folly

03:04:41.620 --> 03:04:43.620
Oh brother

03:04:46.820 --> 03:04:52.020
Okay, I want to get one of these because I want to give one to Poseidon because Poseidon I really like his dash

03:04:53.940 --> 03:05:00.900
Can you touch my ears? Okay, only you only you can touch my ears. I'll give you I'll let you touch him because you're so cute

03:05:06.500 --> 03:05:09.300
It is a privilege only given to a select few

03:05:13.060 --> 03:05:15.060
I'm just gonna shoot at nothing

03:05:15.540 --> 03:05:17.540
Oh

03:05:23.060 --> 03:05:25.060
Oh frick I got stuck on the table

03:05:27.300 --> 03:05:32.420
All right, at least that worked out perfect sweet sweet literally because it's nectar. Ha ha

03:05:34.660 --> 03:05:36.580
No fair

03:05:36.580 --> 03:05:41.060
Yeah, I'm lying about it everybody only Tio can touch my ears. You can't

03:05:41.380 --> 03:05:44.260
Ha ha ha and the other girls from my my you know

03:05:45.140 --> 03:05:49.140
The girls that I deem for the which is all of them. Just like you guys because you guys are trash

03:05:58.340 --> 03:06:06.440
Oh great here we go. What is this? Oh my lord have mycy on me, please

03:06:11.060 --> 03:06:13.940
What is this portal thing? It's locked. How will I ever know?

03:06:15.860 --> 03:06:21.780
Oh, what the frick am I doing? I didn't mean to dash. I meant to oh, I was a cute girl. I'm nervous

03:06:21.860 --> 03:06:25.220
I don't know how to act. I'm I'm underperforming at performance anxiety

03:06:41.060 --> 03:06:43.060
What's the portal for though

03:06:44.180 --> 03:06:47.380
It looks so soft my ears are very soft. They're like velvet

03:06:48.740 --> 03:06:53.060
Even better than velvet. Why is the money locked? I have oh, I don't have enough points, probably

03:06:58.340 --> 03:07:01.300
Zesty oh, can I please get up? What the heck?

03:07:03.700 --> 03:07:05.700
What does that do?

03:07:06.580 --> 03:07:08.580
I bet that

03:07:08.980 --> 03:07:11.620
I'm generally interested in what that actually does for me

03:07:13.380 --> 03:07:17.380
Ever no one will notice I'm underperforming everybody's watching me. I'm gonna pee myself

03:07:18.020 --> 03:07:20.020
I'd love to take the portal but I don't have enough

03:07:20.980 --> 03:07:24.020
Would it just bring me to magura? I feel like it would make another key

03:07:26.100 --> 03:07:28.600
Someone's there. Well, I'll never find out

03:07:28.600 --> 03:07:30.600
I

03:07:38.280 --> 03:07:41.800
Might die this run again, I'm getting shitty boons

03:07:46.520 --> 03:07:48.520
I actually have to play well

03:07:58.760 --> 03:08:02.280
No freaking don't go behind the pillar. Oh freak. I didn't mean to do that

03:08:09.240 --> 03:08:14.680
I can use this to unlock a weapon. Oh perfect Poseidon. Oh, yes, perfect. Oh freak. I only have 10 health though

03:08:17.080 --> 03:08:22.440
It brings you to a special character. She literally cannot take the portal

03:08:29.240 --> 03:08:32.200
She already learned to blame the boons. Oh, no

03:08:33.400 --> 03:08:35.400
Oh, why?

03:08:54.760 --> 03:08:56.760
I'm not gonna make it

03:08:59.320 --> 03:09:01.320
Oh

03:09:01.960 --> 03:09:03.960
Fuck I forgot

03:09:08.600 --> 03:09:10.600
I don't care about little dudes

03:09:13.080 --> 03:09:15.080
Oh

03:09:15.080 --> 03:09:17.080
I don't want to fuck this up

03:09:19.800 --> 03:09:21.800
I fucked it up

03:09:22.360 --> 03:09:26.280
Damn that thing is hard to deal with if I had the dash I would

03:09:26.840 --> 03:09:31.560
I if I had a if I just had a better dash, I think I would do better or if I had a better um

03:09:32.920 --> 03:09:34.920
Something or other it's fine

03:09:38.360 --> 03:09:42.200
I want to give the boon to Poseidon because I feel like he had something good

03:09:51.800 --> 03:09:53.800
They know as much as weird

03:09:54.440 --> 03:09:58.440
Uh, I don't want to talk to hip-nose because he's just fucking fucking shits on me each time

03:09:58.920 --> 03:10:00.920
So how did it go?

03:10:01.560 --> 03:10:03.560
In that case, I'll spare you the details

03:10:04.120 --> 03:10:05.240
Fine

03:10:05.240 --> 03:10:07.240
Your failure is quite easily

03:10:07.720 --> 03:10:09.400
Sorry, I read fast

03:10:09.400 --> 03:10:11.400
Even though I love the voice acting

03:10:11.400 --> 03:10:14.200
I happen to know whom I should thank for the weapons just outside my chambers

03:10:14.440 --> 03:10:19.880
Short kinks. Maybe like bullet hells. Well, you're in hell and there's a lot of damaging hit boxes

03:10:20.840 --> 03:10:22.840
Let's charge time in the bow would be nice. Yeah

03:10:25.400 --> 03:10:27.720
No Poseidon dash and run go next

03:10:30.440 --> 03:10:32.440
If you hit the pillars off times you break it

03:10:34.760 --> 03:10:36.760
Had no idea

03:10:42.680 --> 03:10:44.680
Oh

03:10:45.400 --> 03:10:47.400
Oh

03:10:56.360 --> 03:10:57.960
Something about a war

03:10:57.960 --> 03:11:01.560
Father sent Thanatos to take stock, but you're right. It's been a while now that you mentioned it

03:11:02.760 --> 03:11:04.760

03:15:26.280 --> 03:15:28.760
Okay game paused I didn't know I could pause the game

03:15:59.800 --> 03:16:01.800
Get the freaking aoe

03:16:07.160 --> 03:16:09.160
I was trying to dash out the way

03:16:10.760 --> 03:16:12.760
Yeah

03:16:13.640 --> 03:16:16.920
No, no, oh frick. I need to go to the choke point

03:16:17.720 --> 03:16:19.720
Okay

03:16:21.240 --> 03:16:23.240
Come on

03:16:23.800 --> 03:16:29.960
Oh, I didn't mean to dash forward. There we go a centaur heart

03:16:35.880 --> 03:16:41.800

03:16:42.360 --> 03:16:44.360
Oh

03:16:44.360 --> 03:16:49.560
I'm blushing you can't tell because I can't reach my toggles right now, but I'm blushing so much

03:16:54.440 --> 03:16:56.440
Actually, I'm gonna stay on the side

03:16:58.920 --> 03:17:00.920
I always love my little lurkers

03:17:03.640 --> 03:17:05.640
Especially if they're cute girls

03:17:09.000 --> 03:17:11.000
No, wait, let me just

03:17:11.320 --> 03:17:14.200
Make it so you guys can't get over here and jump at me

03:17:16.280 --> 03:17:18.280
Oh

03:17:18.520 --> 03:17:22.920
I really like this game. Uh, oh d. Los hammer. Let's freaking go

03:17:26.440 --> 03:17:28.440
I'm gonna melt under the pressure

03:17:28.440 --> 03:17:30.440
Oh

03:17:40.200 --> 03:17:42.200
This is a bad area

03:17:45.720 --> 03:17:47.720
I don't have anybody to shoot at

03:17:50.440 --> 03:17:52.440
Now now

03:17:55.240 --> 03:17:57.240
I got me in the freaking choke point

03:17:59.240 --> 03:18:06.760
I don't know. I keep pressing the wrong button. Uh, let's see a special fire. I might

03:18:08.280 --> 03:18:10.280
Do four plus shots

03:18:14.520 --> 03:18:17.320
The triple shot was actually helpful because it locked onto multiple targets

03:18:18.600 --> 03:18:20.600
Uh

03:18:22.360 --> 03:18:24.360
I do like that

03:18:24.360 --> 03:18:26.360
I

03:18:26.600 --> 03:18:31.160
Where is the hundred I cleared that last map for you, baby girl

03:18:32.200 --> 03:18:37.160
Uh, I don't really need to go to the shop. So I'd rather get a key so I can unlock that little pitchy fork

03:18:45.160 --> 03:18:47.160
Oh frick

03:18:49.000 --> 03:18:53.240
I need to get them to walk on this I can shoot it

03:18:54.360 --> 03:18:56.360
Come on

03:18:57.000 --> 03:18:59.000
Yeah, there we go

03:18:59.640 --> 03:19:01.640
Perfect

03:19:02.360 --> 03:19:04.360

Oh just for you just for you

03:19:30.040 --> 03:19:32.920
That hit me. Oh, I guess I did a key to a weapon

03:19:34.440 --> 03:19:39.640
What does this mean? Which way this way because I don't know what it means and I'm curious

03:19:41.880 --> 03:19:44.440
I mean the mods discord not nitro

03:19:45.320 --> 03:19:47.160

How much you miss all the time triple shot is a no brainer root you dick

03:19:51.400 --> 03:19:53.400
I

03:19:53.800 --> 03:19:56.360
Don't even have discord nitro. Who are you?

03:19:57.720 --> 03:19:59.720
Are you freaking sisyphus?

03:20:01.320 --> 03:20:03.320
Oh, it is

03:20:03.560 --> 03:20:05.800
Oh, I didn't get to read that on a little strollers all

03:20:06.440 --> 03:20:11.560
Do me a favor though. You see the fury sisters. Let them know. I accidentally moved my knee and I bumped my

03:20:12.440 --> 03:20:17.480
Hand to press the button. Oh, I'll let them know. We'll write. I hear you loud and clear your highness

03:20:17.720 --> 03:20:20.440
Why is that rock have a smiley face on it? You take care

03:20:21.400 --> 03:20:23.400
I

03:20:24.280 --> 03:20:26.280
Got my guy

03:20:27.160 --> 03:20:29.160

What your life total is 68 out of 75 lose it all for an express trip back to the house of hades. Why would I want that?

03:20:44.360 --> 03:20:46.360
Used to permanently go stronger

03:20:48.920 --> 03:20:50.920
Why

03:20:51.880 --> 03:20:53.880
It's boldy what

03:20:59.320 --> 03:21:04.520
Wait, so I'm kind of confused. So if I talk to him, he just gives me something or is he gonna send me back to hades if I click

03:21:04.520 --> 03:21:06.520
this one

03:21:10.760 --> 03:21:12.760
Let's find out. Oh shit

03:21:13.720 --> 03:21:15.160
Cheers mate

03:21:15.160 --> 03:21:18.760
The underworld's power. Oh, actually that was good. Oh aphrodite

03:21:19.720 --> 03:21:22.600
Oh, god, is am I gonna talk to this thing again?

03:21:25.160 --> 03:21:30.360
Okay, I won't kill you. Okay, cool. You can do it. Oh, thanks, Sisyphus

03:21:32.760 --> 03:21:34.760
Oh freaking hell

03:21:48.760 --> 03:21:51.720
I kind of wish I had the Hermes around for this

03:22:18.760 --> 03:22:21.720
Yeah

03:22:48.760 --> 03:22:50.760
Oh

03:22:57.480 --> 03:22:59.480
Why did I stand there?

03:23:01.160 --> 03:23:03.160
Anyone else

03:23:03.720 --> 03:23:09.000
Anyone else that was pretty badass people die when they're killed

03:23:12.760 --> 03:23:14.760
Oh special deals were

03:23:19.480 --> 03:23:21.480
I

03:23:23.240 --> 03:23:28.680
Can max out my life do I get more life empty inside

03:23:33.800 --> 03:23:36.280
I feel like I get more life, don't I permanently

03:23:38.760 --> 03:23:41.400
I need an answer. I don't think the wrong thing on accident

03:23:43.560 --> 03:23:45.560
Her weak effects have longer duration

03:23:49.560 --> 03:23:51.560
I

03:23:53.240 --> 03:23:55.560
Take a sippy while I wait for you guys to catch up in the ball

03:23:59.000 --> 03:24:01.000
Raina you're so cute

03:24:02.840 --> 03:24:07.080
Oh, and they give you more you get more in the future. Okay, I thought it permanently raised my life

03:24:08.120 --> 03:24:12.760
I'm not gonna do that. Then I'm going to do the empty inside the longer duration because then

03:24:15.000 --> 03:24:17.000
Wait, I thought that would make this longer

03:24:17.960 --> 03:24:20.120
I don't know whatever it is or really fucking matter

03:24:36.040 --> 03:24:38.040
This is helpful against them

03:24:41.320 --> 03:24:43.320
Is there a bone thing no

03:24:47.160 --> 03:24:49.160
Oh, what the hell? Oh

03:24:54.440 --> 03:24:57.080
Oh, we shouldn't walk on this out

03:25:06.280 --> 03:25:08.280
Sure

03:25:17.720 --> 03:25:20.200
No, I thought that was gonna be I would like more boons

03:25:23.720 --> 03:25:28.520
Why don't I just knock down? Frick Raina you're falling off of my lap

03:25:30.680 --> 03:25:32.680
Okay, let's just hop down

03:25:33.640 --> 03:25:35.640
Hold on. I need to get more comfy

03:25:37.800 --> 03:25:40.760
Can't believe this game has a pause. I'm not used to games with pauses

03:25:40.760 --> 03:25:42.760
I

03:25:42.840 --> 03:25:45.960
Still haven't beaten those stupid twin things and

03:25:46.760 --> 03:25:48.760
Elden ring because I haven't played since

03:25:49.240 --> 03:25:51.560
My last stream, but I'm probably gonna do that

03:25:52.920 --> 03:25:54.920
After these

03:25:59.320 --> 03:26:02.440
No, not you fuckers. Oh, I swear to god. Oh, no

03:26:07.240 --> 03:26:09.560
Oh frickin hate you guys

03:26:10.920 --> 03:26:12.920
Oh

03:26:22.360 --> 03:26:24.360
They have so much reach

03:26:26.440 --> 03:26:28.440
Okay, I'm getting the timing right

03:26:33.800 --> 03:26:37.000
Oh, why did I turn around? Oh, fuck this fucking

03:26:37.960 --> 03:26:40.440
These have too much range in my opinion

03:26:48.600 --> 03:26:50.600
I was hoping I could get to lane with spikes

03:26:58.600 --> 03:27:00.600
Come on

03:27:01.560 --> 03:27:03.560
No, why'd you walk around it

03:27:07.960 --> 03:27:09.960
I

03:27:13.080 --> 03:27:15.080
All right, let's get the poem

03:27:16.680 --> 03:27:18.680
Yeah, that's when virgins

03:27:31.880 --> 03:27:34.120
I stand behind here I could probably

03:27:37.160 --> 03:27:39.160
Walk

03:27:41.880 --> 03:27:44.280
Yeah, I could walk him there right on cue

03:27:53.800 --> 03:27:57.480
She's stuck in there. Oh, that was weird

03:28:07.000 --> 03:28:09.160
Oh, fuck me

03:28:37.000 --> 03:28:39.000
Okay

03:28:58.360 --> 03:29:00.360
Extra blessing

03:29:01.240 --> 03:29:03.960
I woke up and madame is winning as she is

03:29:04.840 --> 03:29:07.240
Oh shout with aries to buy something

03:29:08.280 --> 03:29:10.280
Oh, that's not what I meant

03:29:17.960 --> 03:29:19.960
I spy everything because I have the money

03:29:23.960 --> 03:29:25.960
Where the fuck am I

03:29:30.440 --> 03:29:32.440
Yeah

03:29:36.600 --> 03:29:38.600
Now

03:29:40.680 --> 03:29:45.800
Yeah, I think I thought if I I can't really hit them that well with the arrow

03:29:46.200 --> 03:29:48.840
I think it's easier to deflect stuff with the fucking uh

03:29:50.600 --> 03:29:53.160
With the dash or with the

03:29:58.200 --> 03:30:00.200
Or with the sword in my opinion

03:30:00.920 --> 03:30:05.800
Because I feel like and obviously what's with the fucking shield

03:30:11.240 --> 03:30:14.120
Ow and realize that the moment I stepped on it

03:30:24.680 --> 03:30:26.680
I might die for this one

03:30:30.440 --> 03:30:32.440
I

03:30:41.880 --> 03:30:43.880
Because it's hard to shoot those things out of here

03:30:50.840 --> 03:30:54.040
Hey, what's up aries let's fucking go

03:31:00.360 --> 03:31:05.000
And one shot back in the war. Oh fuck. Yeah, please do take care of it. I do

03:31:06.280 --> 03:31:08.280
Athena dashes great deflect

03:31:08.760 --> 03:31:13.000
She didn't invest in the dash. Yes. I did invest in the get dash. What are you talking about?

03:31:17.400 --> 03:31:19.400
I can get this again

03:31:25.400 --> 03:31:27.000
I kind of want this again

03:31:27.000 --> 03:31:30.840
Kill or be killed because I don't I haven't had anything for my special

03:31:31.880 --> 03:31:33.880

Wait, did I accidentally click the other one?

03:31:47.640 --> 03:31:49.640
Do you want to attack us here for bow? Well too bad I didn't

03:31:53.320 --> 03:31:55.320

03:32:05.000 --> 03:32:08.840
From fall out. Hey, what's that you got some sort of ways for sale? Hey, what's that?

03:32:11.160 --> 03:32:13.160
I don't have any money

03:32:15.800 --> 03:32:17.560
I'll take that

03:32:17.560 --> 03:32:21.080
Frick I do not have enough money to beat megara

03:32:22.680 --> 03:32:24.680
Shit

03:32:25.320 --> 03:32:31.320

03:32:34.600 --> 03:32:36.600
Oh no

03:32:40.600 --> 03:32:42.600
Bro

03:32:42.760 --> 03:32:47.640
You are so hot your whip's not been all that persuasive in the past. Do we have a history?

03:32:48.920 --> 03:32:52.520
Brother, excuse me. Maybe persistence will pay off for both of us

03:32:53.240 --> 03:32:55.740
She don't mean it and she she definitely don't mean

03:33:06.760 --> 03:33:08.760
Ow, how'd she hit me with that?

03:33:22.520 --> 03:33:24.520
Oh

03:33:27.320 --> 03:33:30.920
Wait, I forgot to have this. Oh fuck. Oh fuck

03:33:35.480 --> 03:33:37.480
Oh, I just got anxious

03:33:45.640 --> 03:33:47.640
Stop chasing me bitch

03:33:52.760 --> 03:33:54.760

Wow

03:34:19.880 --> 03:34:21.880

Oh, I thought I could run out see I that's where I need the extra fucking dash. Uh, so that's why I'm gonna buy next

03:34:45.320 --> 03:34:49.240
I'm actually I think I might she got me. I'm very determined to beat megara

03:34:52.680 --> 03:34:56.120
I don't talk to you you again. Everybody's being such a dick

03:34:59.960 --> 03:35:04.760
Why I can scarce believe my art is everybody just sarcastic

03:35:06.920 --> 03:35:08.920
Anything you say to me you save

03:35:11.880 --> 03:35:17.000
Everybody's just me the fury got you again. She is unstoppable, isn't she one time

03:35:17.160 --> 03:35:20.680
I tried to stop her on the way to have a chat with your dad and she didn't even turn her head

03:35:22.920 --> 03:35:25.720
No, actually I'm happy I talked to you that time

03:35:26.840 --> 03:35:28.600
Killies I

03:35:28.600 --> 03:35:32.520
Sometimes I fear that father if he somebody is doing fireworks

03:35:33.240 --> 03:35:36.840
Your father's still getting caught up with work that I created for him in my mortal days

03:35:37.320 --> 03:35:42.200
Or it's the ops. I'm sorry. There's nothing he can take from me. We have a mutual arrangement. He and I

03:35:42.600 --> 03:35:45.640
Oh, yeah, we're we're gonna beat make the stream. I'm determined. You're right

03:35:47.320 --> 03:35:49.320
I'm very determined

03:35:49.560 --> 03:35:51.560
Oh wait, I want to talk to her

03:35:52.680 --> 03:35:54.680
I

03:35:56.200 --> 03:36:01.480
I just wanted to apologize because I think maybe I didn't act very appropriately last time you spoke to

03:36:02.040 --> 03:36:04.040
Deucer, please. There's no need to apologize

03:36:05.080 --> 03:36:07.080
I can't wait to use your head as an ono

03:36:11.400 --> 03:36:13.400
You really needed

03:36:13.480 --> 03:36:15.480
Thank you. Thanks so much

03:36:19.160 --> 03:36:21.160
Tee hee hee she's so cute

03:36:23.480 --> 03:36:25.480
Me me me me me

03:36:30.200 --> 03:36:36.440
Hi pretty lady your hair is the night and I think that's like my favorite part is you have the night sky in your hair

03:36:37.160 --> 03:36:41.800
That's so cool. I'll see you. I wish I could do that, but it wouldn't make sense because I'm a bunny

03:36:42.040 --> 03:36:44.040
I don't think there'd be bunnies in my hair

03:36:44.680 --> 03:36:47.960
Leave her alone. What do you mean? She's I love her

03:36:49.240 --> 03:36:51.240
I love Deucer

03:36:53.480 --> 03:36:56.840
Can't afford that. I didn't mean to click that. I'm going to click that. Um

03:37:08.680 --> 03:37:12.120
I can I can boost this again feeling good. Okay

03:37:14.360 --> 03:37:16.360
Go lie down

03:37:17.160 --> 03:37:19.160
The hell

03:37:19.240 --> 03:37:23.720
It is the dead of night or the approximation of my sleepwalking

03:37:24.920 --> 03:37:31.400
Prince of the underworld Zagreus rises from a fitful slumber with much mischief on his mind

03:37:33.240 --> 03:37:37.720
Mischief me I was just going to have a little look through father's stuff. Damn, okay

03:37:39.000 --> 03:37:41.000
All is quiet at this time

03:37:41.400 --> 03:37:46.840
Ever dreaming hypnos put a spell upon the house as willful Zagreus had asked of him

03:37:47.800 --> 03:37:54.360
All are fast asleep say for the prince. Excuse me, but why did I wake up exactly lower your voice old man?

03:37:54.440 --> 03:37:56.440
I'm trying to be sneaky here

03:38:00.200 --> 03:38:03.480
He ventures toward the stately throne of his lord father

03:38:04.360 --> 03:38:06.360
Half expecting to be caught

03:38:06.760 --> 03:38:09.240
But he'll expecting what he is about to find

03:38:11.480 --> 03:38:13.480
I said shut up old man

03:38:17.000 --> 03:38:19.960
Daddy's gone. He does not know exactly what he seeks

03:38:20.840 --> 03:38:23.880
He only knows that something always has fell to off to him

03:38:24.600 --> 03:38:26.600
But he does not belong

03:38:26.600 --> 03:38:32.120
Oh, it's a flashback. Oh lord ades never would indulge such questions

03:38:33.160 --> 03:38:36.440
So prince who are my parents? Who's my mom?

03:38:39.080 --> 03:38:42.120
I'm not listening. Tell me about my mother

03:38:42.520 --> 03:38:47.560
The rifles through his lord father's possessions. There is not much of any import there

03:38:48.360 --> 03:38:50.600
ledgers and administrative department work

03:38:52.760 --> 03:38:58.040
Okay, maybe not because I'm suddenly getting tired reference to his son. I will try

03:39:00.920 --> 03:39:03.480
With core knocked by my side, I can do anything

03:39:04.440 --> 03:39:06.120
but then

03:39:06.120 --> 03:39:08.120
There is the note

03:39:08.360 --> 03:39:13.880
Written finally in a hand and voice the likes of which my mom is a Persephone

03:39:15.160 --> 03:39:16.600
Hades

03:39:16.600 --> 03:39:19.000
I can no longer tolerate my life here in this place

03:39:19.880 --> 03:39:22.040
So I'm leaving even if it kills me

03:39:23.240 --> 03:39:25.240
I won't be returning to olympus

03:39:25.640 --> 03:39:27.560
If there is a place where I belong in this world

03:39:28.200 --> 03:39:30.600
It must be so my mom abandoned me great

03:39:31.640 --> 03:39:33.640
Perhaps it's like I should love some meat

03:39:35.240 --> 03:39:37.240
Take care of Cerberus

03:39:37.240 --> 03:39:39.080
I shall miss him

03:39:39.080 --> 03:39:41.080
Persephone

03:39:41.560 --> 03:39:42.680
Mom

03:39:42.680 --> 03:39:44.680
The prince of the underworld Zagreus

03:39:45.160 --> 03:39:47.640
Absorbed the contents of this hidden letter

03:39:48.360 --> 03:39:52.280
Written in his mother's hand. Hey, how does he know it was his mom?

03:39:54.120 --> 03:39:56.120
My mother's hand. Wait what?

03:39:56.440 --> 03:39:59.080
You're saying this Persephone that she's my

03:39:59.800 --> 03:40:01.800
The narrator spoiled it

03:40:02.200 --> 03:40:04.200
But father always said that nix was

03:40:05.160 --> 03:40:07.160
That liar

03:40:07.320 --> 03:40:11.000
He lied to you wait. He lied instead that my grandmother was my mom

03:40:11.720 --> 03:40:15.800
That was that's kind of weird. That means that Hades would have fucked his dad

03:40:17.320 --> 03:40:18.760
I mean

03:40:18.760 --> 03:40:20.200
His mom

03:40:20.200 --> 03:40:23.240
Wait, no Hades is a son of yeah, nix and uh

03:40:25.640 --> 03:40:27.640
That titan right? I don't know

03:40:28.120 --> 03:40:30.120
Thos did the prince

03:40:30.120 --> 03:40:37.880
Inevitably the world kept truth about his lineage entirely by chance. Nice job narrator slash Homer

03:40:44.520 --> 03:40:50.920
I like how I'm like 3d, but not it's very interesting the one time queen of all the underworld

03:40:51.560 --> 03:40:53.960
Where had she gone and why?

03:40:55.080 --> 03:40:58.040
Engulfed by newfound questions and this rage

03:40:58.840 --> 03:41:00.840
Leave me alone

03:41:05.800 --> 03:41:07.800
Well, I still

03:41:08.440 --> 03:41:10.840
I hope not. I hope he didn't

03:41:15.800 --> 03:41:18.600
Nix you why

03:41:20.680 --> 03:41:22.680
How could you you

03:41:23.720 --> 03:41:26.360
You're nix you're not my mother

03:41:27.240 --> 03:41:33.720
All this time you and my father you you lied to me. Ow is some elbow. Oh my dear child

03:41:34.600 --> 03:41:37.560
Oh, so now you know new art. So now you know

03:41:38.440 --> 03:41:42.120
But only half the truth. I can explain the rest so

03:41:43.160 --> 03:41:45.160
please

03:41:45.160 --> 03:41:47.160
I love the half moon

03:41:47.400 --> 03:41:50.440
Love the starlight in her hair. She's literally my favorite design

03:41:51.160 --> 03:41:53.160
Oh

03:41:55.000 --> 03:41:58.600
My arm mother I wonder do you hear that my arm fucking popping

03:42:00.360 --> 03:42:07.240
Yeah, why is there no mention? She's look after the dog. Fuck my son. Don't fuck my son like that, but like fm

03:42:10.040 --> 03:42:12.040
I don't know what I'm saying

03:42:12.840 --> 03:42:14.840
Hey pal

03:42:15.240 --> 03:42:17.240
Nothing is off limits for the greek

03:42:17.800 --> 03:42:27.800
Oh, I can lock this though. Let's see. What's in here for alpha the eternal spear. Oh my pursuit. Oh shit

03:42:31.080 --> 03:42:33.080
Holds then release

03:42:36.680 --> 03:42:38.680
Yo

03:42:39.320 --> 03:42:41.320
Yeah, that was nothing

03:42:45.480 --> 03:42:48.200
Sorry, I'm very excited phrasing

03:42:49.800 --> 03:42:54.680
They cook every day. I believe the minds of this came out me with this myth. Oh someone tell them the fuck

03:43:03.320 --> 03:43:06.200
I never used desk dash attacks. I should probably do that

03:43:06.760 --> 03:43:10.440
I said, I think it's the awkwardness of the bindings

03:43:21.640 --> 03:43:25.640
Damn that is actually sick

03:43:25.640 --> 03:43:27.640
You caught that a kid

03:43:35.320 --> 03:43:37.320
Oh, there's a max cool

03:43:39.160 --> 03:43:41.160
All right

03:43:42.760 --> 03:43:45.560
Interesante by everyone

03:43:48.680 --> 03:43:53.960
Family oh death is your only family death and I

03:43:54.280 --> 03:43:55.480
I

03:43:55.480 --> 03:43:57.480
Best to get accustomed to the both of us

03:43:58.280 --> 03:44:03.000
Like how his laurels are on fire just like mine. I didn't notice that before not on your life

03:44:05.320 --> 03:44:09.640
Poseidon I can give you a gift. I've been waiting for this my entire life

03:44:10.360 --> 03:44:16.440
Uncle Poseidon, it's been excellent to know you sir. So please this is for you. I think this might be the run boys

03:44:16.440 --> 03:44:18.440
Oh

03:44:22.200 --> 03:44:24.440
Oh, I am positively moved

03:44:27.800 --> 03:44:29.320
Oh my god, my I

03:44:29.320 --> 03:44:32.920
Dispenser is going off and scared me sound like someone knocking on my door

03:44:33.640 --> 03:44:36.680
I thank you, uncle. You got a conch shell

03:44:41.000 --> 03:44:44.680
If you your cruel father Hades, he's my elder brother, you know that

03:44:45.400 --> 03:44:47.400
Yeah, we talked about this last time

03:44:48.760 --> 03:44:50.760
Tidal dash, baby

03:44:51.800 --> 03:44:53.800
Tidal dash

03:44:56.920 --> 03:44:58.920
Wait, what's flood shot though

03:45:01.800 --> 03:45:06.600
You can't tell but I'm biting my lip and like the f-boy way

03:45:11.480 --> 03:45:13.480
Uh, okay

03:45:14.680 --> 03:45:18.360
Damn if I could get this in the flood shot, that'd be so good

03:45:24.360 --> 03:45:26.360
Hmm

03:45:36.520 --> 03:45:40.520
Choice, yeah, emoji is perfect. That's exactly what I was doing

03:45:41.480 --> 03:45:44.680
Mmm, I need a lip bite toggle

03:45:47.400 --> 03:45:49.400
I know

03:45:53.640 --> 03:45:55.640
I don't even smile when I'm like

03:45:58.360 --> 03:46:00.600
When I bite my lip, it's just my mouth is closed

03:46:04.440 --> 03:46:06.440
Oh, it's kind of doing it now

03:46:11.480 --> 03:46:14.760
I'm wiggling my eyebrows. I can't tell if you can tell

03:46:25.240 --> 03:46:29.320
It's actually really hard you have to be like do you very exaggerated with your eyebrows

03:46:30.760 --> 03:46:33.240
All right. Well, we're gonna stick with the true and tried

03:46:34.840 --> 03:46:39.960
Tidal dash, baby. Oh wait, I'm doing this like it's a fucking

03:46:40.760 --> 03:46:47.400
Okay, this might not be the run because I don't have the bow, but it's fine

03:46:50.920 --> 03:46:52.920
Because I already fucked it up

03:46:56.120 --> 03:46:58.120
What the hell oh

03:47:01.400 --> 03:47:03.400
Interesting uh

03:47:04.200 --> 03:47:06.200
Uh

03:47:07.800 --> 03:47:09.800
Dash dash dash

03:47:19.160 --> 03:47:21.160
Oh

03:47:22.360 --> 03:47:27.720
Poseidon again. Oh god, here we go. I was so hoping we get oh wait, there's a portal fuck

03:47:29.560 --> 03:47:31.560
I'll never know

03:47:32.360 --> 03:47:34.360
I'm used to the oh

03:47:38.040 --> 03:47:40.040
If I can get my special to be

03:47:45.960 --> 03:47:50.120
A little bit more powerful this might be helpful

03:47:55.240 --> 03:47:57.640
Oh because I get like locked in the animation

03:48:01.560 --> 03:48:03.560
So

03:48:05.240 --> 03:48:08.200
Don't decide it from Olympus. I accept this message

03:48:10.840 --> 03:48:14.680
Your boons do you have more damage and siphon?

03:48:15.880 --> 03:48:21.480
Oh, that's literally what I asked for I asked for more damage for my special and I'm getting it

03:48:32.440 --> 03:48:38.760
The dash strike for this weapon is the main draw bows kind of whack anyways, I like the bow shut up

03:48:39.240 --> 03:48:43.640
Cast is a lot harder use consistently with you needing to run around pick them back up dash is more consistent

03:48:43.640 --> 03:48:46.040
Yeah, I like it. That's a good point. Um

03:48:49.160 --> 03:48:52.360
I just need to get used to the fucking spear

03:48:56.280 --> 03:48:58.280
Can I charge it

03:49:01.640 --> 03:49:03.640
Hello

03:49:08.200 --> 03:49:10.200
Get dead

03:49:15.480 --> 03:49:19.720
I like how I essentially have fucking Poseidon's tried it

03:49:31.960 --> 03:49:33.960
Oh

03:49:36.840 --> 03:49:44.600
This also goes through multiple enemies, so I like that a lot. It's gonna knock something back home. Oh, baby

03:49:51.400 --> 03:49:55.000
Daedalus hammer. Hello. What the fuck I'm stuck on these spots

03:49:55.640 --> 03:50:01.480
Oh, I need to do that. I will keep you at arm's length

03:50:06.760 --> 03:50:08.760
Where oh

03:50:12.760 --> 03:50:14.760
Oh, yeah, I like this

03:50:25.880 --> 03:50:29.000
I can just dash around these bitches

03:50:38.120 --> 03:50:40.120
I like it now to fix up this spear

03:50:45.800 --> 03:50:47.800
I can get this triple jab

03:50:48.520 --> 03:50:50.520
I

03:50:53.000 --> 03:50:55.400
Have I don't really use dash a dash strike a lot

03:51:05.480 --> 03:51:11.640
I like this I like the triple the spread because it helps me focus on more than one enemy at once

03:51:18.120 --> 03:51:21.400
I don't want to jinx the run, but I'm feeling good

03:51:40.040 --> 03:51:42.840
Oh fuck I didn't think he was gonna

03:51:48.200 --> 03:51:54.120
How does he reach me? I didn't think you would have that much fucking. Oh my fucking god

03:51:58.920 --> 03:52:01.160
I need to get money so I can buy health that's for sure

03:52:05.800 --> 03:52:07.800
This hard place to dodge

03:52:17.800 --> 03:52:19.800
I

03:52:20.200 --> 03:52:24.440
Should be useful. Oh, thank god give me this fucking health. I swear to god

03:52:28.920 --> 03:52:31.960
Mmm fucking up. I'm fucking up

03:52:40.200 --> 03:52:42.200
Come on

03:52:42.200 --> 03:52:44.200
Oh

03:52:57.720 --> 03:52:59.720
My nose is a G

03:53:12.200 --> 03:53:14.200
Oh

03:53:18.840 --> 03:53:22.120

03:53:32.280 --> 03:53:35.880

03:53:42.200 --> 03:53:44.200

Have a backstab that's good

03:54:02.200 --> 03:54:04.280
I just like doing this the specials great

03:54:09.080 --> 03:54:11.080

Yeah, we Olympians no longer mean we Olympians

03:54:23.160 --> 03:54:25.160
You're the only exception

03:54:25.960 --> 03:54:30.360
She's a very interesting place. Um, so I can get a call

03:54:37.240 --> 03:54:39.320
That would be helpful against mega

03:54:42.360 --> 03:54:44.360
Oh

03:54:48.440 --> 03:54:51.960

03:55:05.560 --> 03:55:07.560
Oh, let's talk to her again. Hello

03:56:47.080 --> 03:56:49.080
Think I just need some

04:00:21.000 --> 04:00:23.000
Still not enough to beat Megara

04:00:26.040 --> 04:00:28.040

04:00:29.640 --> 04:00:31.640
No, I need the health I need the health

04:00:40.840 --> 04:00:42.840

04:00:49.720 --> 04:00:57.320
Why did that hurt me I was dashing

04:01:13.800 --> 04:01:15.800
Can't even get to these fucking guys

04:01:19.880 --> 04:01:21.880
Is he dead? Okay, yes

04:01:31.160 --> 04:01:33.160
Oh, come on

04:01:33.160 --> 04:01:35.160

04:01:47.720 --> 04:01:49.720
That's a relief

04:01:55.720 --> 04:02:01.160
I think his dash means have to I missed the health on the floor fuck me bro. I didn't know that

04:02:02.120 --> 04:02:04.120
God's grant me strength

04:02:13.880 --> 04:02:17.880
Okay, I'm shopping my senses. Okay. Um

04:02:21.720 --> 04:02:23.720
It is what it is

04:02:25.800 --> 04:02:27.800
Oh, hello

04:02:28.680 --> 04:02:34.840
And there you are again, I love her voice so much let you run a muck in his domain like this

04:02:37.320 --> 04:02:40.840
Uh, I wasn't paying attention. I was more focused on living

04:02:58.280 --> 04:03:00.280
Oh

04:03:10.200 --> 04:03:13.560
What the fuck why was it aiming the wrong way? Oh my god

04:03:13.560 --> 04:03:15.560
Oh

04:03:25.160 --> 04:03:27.160
I don't use my fucking

04:03:43.560 --> 04:03:45.560
Oh

04:04:13.560 --> 04:04:15.560
Oh

04:04:33.240 --> 04:04:37.640
That hurts that hurts that hurts so bad

04:04:38.520 --> 04:04:46.440
Those fucking spikes I get so caught up in what looking at where she is and I'm not looking where I'm going

04:04:51.240 --> 04:04:55.640
The sealed weapons by your chambers your father won't observe their absence. I don't think

04:04:56.520 --> 04:04:59.640
They remind him power that once sealed away the Titans

04:05:02.760 --> 04:05:04.760
I do like the sphere a lot though

04:05:05.720 --> 04:05:12.360
The heck is this you're late with your report hypnos again. Oh, I think that's look like that

04:05:12.920 --> 04:05:18.040
The dead of course can wait. Oh, well, let's see. I woke up. I don't know what time it was and

04:05:18.200 --> 04:05:23.640
He's like floating that every shade had been accounted for just like I always do except I couldn't find my list at first

04:05:23.640 --> 04:05:28.520
Can you believe it into the blast at port already? I don't have all day or night

04:05:28.520 --> 04:05:30.520
Hmm

04:05:30.760 --> 04:05:32.760
Third time's the charm. I hope

04:05:33.720 --> 04:05:38.360
My list I found it over by the lounge it was inside but I am not the one who put it there

04:05:38.440 --> 04:05:44.520
No, sir, so I've been making positively sure it's not been tampered with that it adds everybody's name cause of death

04:05:44.760 --> 04:05:48.520
Plays a bird from her body weight any previous allergies or medications

04:05:52.120 --> 04:05:54.120
Well, aren't you just the sweetest

04:05:54.600 --> 04:05:58.360
Anonymous tip ten dollars. Thank you anonymous alert. Please ignore

04:05:58.760 --> 04:06:04.680
You can dash over gaps and destroy the purple projectiles from the is health and repeated normal attacks

04:06:04.840 --> 04:06:07.320
Conform combos and can be chained with dash

04:06:12.280 --> 04:06:14.760
I knew that I knew I could do that

04:06:15.640 --> 04:06:18.520
Because I've I noticed that I did it accidentally a few times

04:06:19.160 --> 04:06:21.160
um

04:06:21.720 --> 04:06:24.520
I might try harder to train chain stuff, but

04:06:25.480 --> 04:06:27.480
I guess my first time playing the game

04:06:28.840 --> 04:06:32.680
I'm not too worried. I'm kind of you know hanging out. Thank you for the tip though

04:06:39.080 --> 04:06:41.960

Hey, that must be the fated list. He has the best ash

04:07:38.040 --> 04:07:40.040

My extended family seems an interesting lot

04:07:49.400 --> 04:07:51.400

04:08:53.960 --> 04:08:59.160
Can't open this yet. Yeah, but I want to know what it's called. I bet it's like servers is claw or something stupid

04:08:59.400 --> 04:09:01.400
That's kidding. It's probably not that. Let's see what that one does

04:09:06.840 --> 04:09:12.040
Please I honestly might use this a lot because I really like Poseidon's boons. Um, this sounds funny

04:09:12.680 --> 04:09:15.560
Uh, I'll grab. I don't want to do this with this

04:09:16.760 --> 04:09:18.760

04:13:07.880 --> 04:13:09.880
I have to figure out why the fuck it's doing that

04:13:12.120 --> 04:13:14.120
You have my thanks lord Ares

04:13:19.160 --> 04:13:22.920
You're the son of knight herself they say that's a lie. Um

04:13:26.040 --> 04:13:28.920
Yeah, I think I need to start checking before

04:13:29.800 --> 04:13:34.360
When I immediately do my waiting rooms because I think

04:13:35.800 --> 04:13:43.000
Automatically like my template is set to latency and I need to fix that. I didn't set it up my manager did so

04:13:43.800 --> 04:13:45.800
I need to sort that out

04:13:59.480 --> 04:14:07.720
You the blades all fuckies are good. Um, because I'm debating whether to do this or I'm I need I need a dash. I need a dash

Should I get that or a key?

04:14:16.360 --> 04:14:19.240
Get the key because I would like to unlock the claws

Need the moment that I saw her aoe attack and I got stuck in the corner that it was just not going to be a good time

04:34:46.120 --> 04:34:48.120

Hmm

04:36:10.920 --> 04:36:12.920
Thank you Dionysus mate

04:36:17.880 --> 04:36:19.880
Sometimes I have to wonder

04:36:20.200 --> 04:36:22.200
I

04:36:26.360 --> 04:36:28.360
Time to feast

04:36:41.880 --> 04:36:43.880
May I help you

04:36:49.880 --> 04:36:51.880
I

Got it

04:37:12.120 --> 04:37:14.120
What else

I

04:37:33.000 --> 04:37:35.000
Fuck well miss a couple coins

04:37:49.880 --> 04:37:51.880
I

04:38:20.840 --> 04:38:22.840
I

04:38:27.080 --> 04:38:32.520
So all I need to do is sacrifice some of my life essence to go in here. Sorry just associated for a second

04:38:36.200 --> 04:38:38.200
Who or what is that?

04:38:38.840 --> 04:38:42.760
Is this chronos? This is not someone I recognize

04:38:43.560 --> 04:38:45.560
So in the name of Hades

04:38:46.200 --> 04:38:48.200
Hello, may I ask who's calling?

04:38:50.600 --> 04:38:52.600
You

04:38:56.840 --> 04:39:00.440
That is the coolest fucking design I've ever seen in my life, holy shit

04:39:04.920 --> 04:39:10.680
I the artist is such a great job, holy crap the weird ethereal

04:39:11.560 --> 04:39:14.120
The faces the eyes very

04:39:15.400 --> 04:39:17.400
Wow

04:39:19.880 --> 04:39:21.880
Oh, it's chaos

04:39:37.400 --> 04:39:39.900
Like how the world is in their hand

04:39:50.040 --> 04:39:57.080
Each time I attack get hit for five

04:39:59.560 --> 04:40:03.160
That doesn't really make so I just want to be able to use my attack

04:40:10.920 --> 04:40:18.600
I'll have to withstand the whims of chaos to extract the benefit within the underworld's quietest mode and best take all the evidence I find

04:40:20.760 --> 04:40:22.760
I just think

04:40:36.680 --> 04:40:38.680
Who's next

04:40:39.400 --> 04:40:41.400
I

04:40:45.560 --> 04:40:50.840
Surprised I didn't stun lock them like before only stuns lock them when they don't have their armor

04:41:03.960 --> 04:41:05.960
Oh

04:41:08.680 --> 04:41:11.640
Oh

04:41:39.000 --> 04:41:41.000
Oh

04:41:41.320 --> 04:41:43.320

You found me out of us

04:42:18.760 --> 04:42:20.920
Puri down and talk to us has been a real problem

04:42:33.560 --> 04:42:35.560
Let's hunt some dead

04:42:43.320 --> 04:42:45.640
Oh

04:43:13.320 --> 04:43:15.640
Oh

04:43:43.320 --> 04:43:45.320
Oh

04:43:48.280 --> 04:43:50.280
That's something

04:43:55.480 --> 04:43:57.880
I'd rather if it was hell I'd do it

04:44:02.920 --> 04:44:09.320
I need better boons, but I don't feel like dealing with the frickin whatever's

04:44:09.320 --> 04:44:11.320
I

04:44:12.920 --> 04:44:14.920
Think I hear the river

04:44:19.080 --> 04:44:21.080
Much better

04:44:23.880 --> 04:44:28.200
Here on you've been such a reassuring sight I thought I'd offer you a token of my gratitude

04:44:31.880 --> 04:44:33.880
Wait, you don't have to give me something in return

04:44:33.880 --> 04:44:38.440
I don't know what to say mate

04:44:43.400 --> 04:44:45.400
Find a to you as well there mate

04:44:48.440 --> 04:44:54.120

04:45:03.880 --> 04:45:05.880
Oh

04:45:33.880 --> 04:45:35.880
Oh

04:46:01.560 --> 04:46:03.560
Can I please get some health

04:46:04.040 --> 04:46:09.960
And I please get some health lost souls with nowhere left to turn congregate in deepest to tartarus

04:46:10.520 --> 04:46:13.720
Where they fuse together with the earth itself into odious

04:46:13.880 --> 04:46:15.880
Oh sharon is just like

04:46:19.240 --> 04:46:21.240
They basically turn into big crystals

04:46:33.880 --> 04:46:35.880
So

04:46:49.160 --> 04:46:51.160
I had this with the seven

04:46:56.600 --> 04:46:59.000
Now would be perfect my ears itchy

04:47:01.160 --> 04:47:03.160
Oh my god itchy

04:47:04.600 --> 04:47:06.600
Oh

04:47:20.040 --> 04:47:22.040
How am I still alive

04:47:34.840 --> 04:47:36.840
Oh

04:47:51.480 --> 04:47:53.480
Okay, I get datalus

04:47:56.040 --> 04:47:58.360
It's okay. That's all I want. I want that anyways

04:47:59.480 --> 04:48:02.520
Let's see. Let's see. Let's see. Let's see. Let's see. Let's see

04:48:04.840 --> 04:48:06.840
Oh

04:48:22.680 --> 04:48:24.680
More coming

04:48:33.880 --> 04:48:35.880
Oh

04:49:04.120 --> 04:49:06.120
I

04:49:11.640 --> 04:49:17.000
Haven't been using my massive spin because it just walks me in an animation that slows me down

04:49:22.120 --> 04:49:24.840
This will make me have three critical hits so this will be pretty good

04:49:25.640 --> 04:49:27.640
I

04:49:29.320 --> 04:49:36.200
I'm gonna see dianis again. I haven't been using my thing. I totally forgot that I had that

04:49:38.920 --> 04:49:44.280
I'll be honest with you. What is the fucking music? I'll talk to dianis this again

04:49:55.080 --> 04:49:57.080
I

04:49:59.880 --> 04:50:04.600
I'm kind of fun. I need a dash. I'm gonna get the dash

04:50:07.640 --> 04:50:10.760
Because I'm about to go fighter so it's just I need the dash

04:50:16.920 --> 04:50:19.400
All right, hello, I'm sorry I'm gonna be locked in

04:50:19.400 --> 04:50:21.400
Oh

04:50:31.080 --> 04:50:33.080
How does she still get the fucking hit me

04:50:49.400 --> 04:50:51.400
Oh

04:51:13.320 --> 04:51:15.320
Oh

04:51:19.400 --> 04:51:21.400
Oh

04:51:21.400 --> 04:51:23.400
Oh

04:51:23.400 --> 04:51:25.400
So

04:51:44.600 --> 04:51:46.600
Just ran into that

04:51:47.320 --> 04:51:49.320
Oh

04:51:51.080 --> 04:51:55.000
Bro, I fucking hate her so much

04:51:59.480 --> 04:52:02.920
Oh, you win this round make I don't understand

04:52:05.080 --> 04:52:08.120
Why am I so shit at this game? It's pissing me off

04:52:09.080 --> 04:52:11.080
You got

04:52:12.040 --> 04:52:16.520
Hey, old prince, I have to say lord authorizing transfer the know that

04:52:17.400 --> 04:52:21.720
Well, that's the spirit. I suppose I wouldn't mind their help. I guess or shame

04:52:25.640 --> 04:52:29.960
Hey, uh, father, why don't you get this you think you can

04:52:31.560 --> 04:52:33.560
You're welcome father

04:52:36.520 --> 04:52:38.520
Oh why he doesn't fucking give me anything dick

04:52:41.160 --> 04:52:43.160
Nick's I have to ask you something

04:52:43.960 --> 04:52:47.160
Your mother yet lives there can be no other explanation

04:52:48.200 --> 04:52:50.520
For it. I think I turned out okay

04:53:03.240 --> 04:53:05.240
Um, thanks

04:53:05.960 --> 04:53:11.320
I don't blame the boons because I could have won with the boons I had

04:53:15.720 --> 04:53:17.720
Show me something new

04:53:26.520 --> 04:53:29.160
Nice felt that I think

04:53:29.960 --> 04:53:37.480
It's like any one of the runs I could I should have beat her I should have beat her

04:53:39.000 --> 04:53:41.640
What's this one do I'm keeping the lucky tooth. I think

04:53:42.600 --> 04:53:44.840
It's just Dionysus and I just get boons

04:53:45.640 --> 04:53:47.640
although I like

04:53:47.800 --> 04:53:49.800
Sisyphus is good

04:53:49.800 --> 04:53:54.200
To be honest when you get like when you feel like you're gonna have a shit run. That's what it's good for

04:54:00.120 --> 04:54:03.080
I need to lean back. Oh my fucking legs

04:54:05.880 --> 04:54:10.200
operations increased I don't really know what that means but sure go off

04:54:13.800 --> 04:54:18.600
You're really good. No, I don't think I am though. Like I know I can be fucking better than that. It's pissing me off

04:54:19.720 --> 04:54:24.680
I know I can be better. What the hell? I didn't mean to press that. I know I can be better. I'm gonna press those

04:54:25.320 --> 04:54:27.320
I

04:54:27.640 --> 04:54:32.280
What's up handsome, let me give you a piece of advice for you. You're gonna cross a guy like me out there

04:54:32.280 --> 04:54:37.320
You just give him a good stab right in the back without a second the most interesting character

04:54:37.320 --> 04:54:39.320
I

04:54:54.040 --> 04:54:58.200
Just I wish I was one of those people that was just cracked at any game they touched. I know I know people like that

04:55:05.240 --> 04:55:07.240
My weapons hidden talents

04:55:08.120 --> 04:55:10.120
Oh

04:55:13.080 --> 04:55:16.120
Oh, but that special is good

04:55:19.960 --> 04:55:25.480
I'm gonna go with this though just change score again because it is just really nice to have

04:55:25.640 --> 04:55:27.640
Oh

04:55:35.720 --> 04:55:41.000
Each time the prince delves back into the underworld it's ever shifting chambers real up

04:55:44.840 --> 04:55:47.480
Like I like the game a lot. I'm just mad that I'm shit at it

04:55:56.440 --> 04:55:58.440
Oh

04:56:00.040 --> 04:56:03.640
Why I'm sorry you're coming for me. I didn't lock on for some reason

04:56:26.440 --> 04:56:28.440
Oh

04:56:32.680 --> 04:56:36.040
It is simpler you have to really just like dumb it down in your head

04:56:47.240 --> 04:56:49.240
I like how for airy sound it's like

04:56:56.120 --> 04:56:58.120
I

04:56:59.640 --> 04:57:03.800
Yeah, I'm in that doom. That'll be fucking perfect for that. All right

04:57:06.680 --> 04:57:08.680
I don't know what doom means, but I like it

04:57:10.520 --> 04:57:13.160
I've already like I've seen myself improve with the game. That's for sure

04:57:17.720 --> 04:57:19.720
I don't think I need to go to

04:57:26.200 --> 04:57:28.200
Oh

04:57:31.080 --> 04:57:34.840
Oh my god, see that's what I mean. I hope I want to get a fetus thing

04:57:39.560 --> 04:57:41.960
I didn't even get to this dude. Come here you fucking bitch

04:57:45.720 --> 04:57:47.880
Why is it not properly locking on?

04:57:52.200 --> 04:57:54.200
Come here you fucker

04:57:55.480 --> 04:57:57.480
I

04:58:06.360 --> 04:58:10.680
Don't know how you rank up a lucky tooth. I could see chaos, but I don't feel like it

04:58:10.680 --> 04:58:13.960
I'm gonna see Poseidon. Hopefully he can get me the dash

04:58:25.480 --> 04:58:27.480
I

04:58:45.720 --> 04:58:50.120
My ex-girlfriend she just won't let me fucking leave bro. It's just fucking sucks dude

04:58:55.480 --> 04:58:57.480
I

04:59:00.200 --> 04:59:02.200
See God's might

04:59:07.640 --> 04:59:09.640
Yeah, I got a good dash

04:59:12.680 --> 04:59:17.400
Dash I'm coming in fast first place you're coming in fucking hell, bro

04:59:17.800 --> 04:59:19.800
Oh

04:59:22.600 --> 04:59:29.080
I do really like I'm happy I picked it. Oh, okay. We're gonna do another Poseidon. I mean areas

04:59:40.920 --> 04:59:42.920
This I would have broken an armor

04:59:48.360 --> 04:59:50.360
I had

04:59:59.560 --> 05:00:02.200
Oh, why do I keep fucking running into those stupid bombs?

05:00:17.720 --> 05:00:21.160
Um, every word I was saying

05:00:29.480 --> 05:00:33.880
Every word I was gonna say I lost my train of thought doesn't matter

05:00:38.040 --> 05:00:40.040
Oh no

05:00:47.400 --> 05:00:49.400
Oh

05:01:05.320 --> 05:01:09.400
Being a palm fuck it do the trial

05:01:17.400 --> 05:01:19.400
Oh

05:01:26.600 --> 05:01:31.000
That's enough there we are and my keep

05:01:33.880 --> 05:01:35.880
Nope

05:01:42.760 --> 05:01:44.760
I don't reach on that

05:01:47.400 --> 05:01:49.400
I

05:02:10.280 --> 05:02:12.280
Delicious

05:02:18.280 --> 05:02:20.280
Stronger still

05:02:27.240 --> 05:02:29.240
Are we leaving shortly

05:02:47.960 --> 05:02:49.960
Oh

05:03:09.480 --> 05:03:11.480
Where now

05:03:17.640 --> 05:03:19.640
Karen's shop

05:03:21.640 --> 05:03:24.280
I wish I had a little bit more money so I could

05:03:26.280 --> 05:03:28.280
Get something from Aphrodite

05:03:28.280 --> 05:03:30.280
I'm short of coin

05:03:31.480 --> 05:03:36.840
Oh wait, but I got Sisyphus up there. It's fine. I had to ask I'll take this one

05:03:37.240 --> 05:03:39.240
Oh

05:03:43.400 --> 05:03:47.640
Hello your highness hey, is this of us you're actually perfect timing

05:03:48.760 --> 05:03:50.840
Oh, that is quite an undertaking prince

05:03:50.840 --> 05:03:52.840
So

05:04:03.400 --> 05:04:05.880
Then here you go on my authority

05:04:11.640 --> 05:04:13.640
Karen's shop

05:04:14.200 --> 05:04:16.200
What am I supposed to do here?

05:04:16.840 --> 05:04:24.440
Oh, I could have gotten obels and they could have bought shit. Damn. I didn't know who's gonna be next

05:04:28.280 --> 05:04:30.280
Because it'll been great to get another palm

05:04:35.480 --> 05:04:39.080
Buy this just to get the extra point of health

05:04:39.080 --> 05:04:48.360
She's like this is like the fifth time you've been here

05:05:09.320 --> 05:05:11.320
I'll make this quick

05:05:20.600 --> 05:05:22.600
I'll kill you when you stand

05:05:39.080 --> 05:05:41.080
Oh

05:06:09.080 --> 05:06:11.080
Oh

05:06:27.080 --> 05:06:29.080
I'll make you pay

05:06:39.080 --> 05:06:42.040
Oh

05:07:09.080 --> 05:07:11.080
Oh

05:07:39.240 --> 05:07:41.240
Oh

05:07:44.600 --> 05:07:46.600
Let's go

05:07:52.200 --> 05:07:54.200
Killings might know what to do with this

05:07:56.200 --> 05:07:58.200
I just killed somebody

05:08:02.600 --> 05:08:07.720
I was getting pissed I was like dude if I don't beat her this time I'm losing it

05:08:10.040 --> 05:08:12.040
Oh

05:08:16.280 --> 05:08:20.520
Let's fucking go what how did you

05:08:30.440 --> 05:08:32.440
Can wash away my bones

05:08:39.080 --> 05:08:41.080
Okay

05:08:58.360 --> 05:09:00.360
I want to keep playing

05:09:09.720 --> 05:09:11.720
Does it auto save

05:09:18.040 --> 05:09:22.360
Do I keep fighting if I quit

05:09:26.280 --> 05:09:33.480
If I quit does it does it cancel everything I'm done I can save what can I save

05:09:34.440 --> 05:09:36.440
I

05:09:36.760 --> 05:09:38.760
Just don't save

05:09:38.760 --> 05:09:44.360
This is projects progress saved a minute ago. I saved. Okay. I just kind of want to peek ahead though

05:09:46.840 --> 05:09:48.840
No, I'll save it for next time. Okay

05:09:50.040 --> 05:09:53.400
We beat her. I should have beat her sooner. I'm mad at myself for that

05:09:54.680 --> 05:09:56.680
I really like this the sphere

05:09:57.640 --> 05:09:59.640
Um, just a hit give up

05:09:59.800 --> 05:10:01.480
Um

05:10:01.560 --> 05:10:04.040
Is really good. I like the sphere

05:10:06.200 --> 05:10:08.200
And

05:10:10.120 --> 05:10:12.120
No, just

05:10:12.680 --> 05:10:14.680
That's something I could interact with

05:10:15.160 --> 05:10:23.880
None other than those in the trusted inner circle of lord hades are authorized to enter the intricate chambers connecting the vast regions of the underworld

05:10:24.760 --> 05:10:27.480
But the prince decides to barge in anyway

05:10:28.280 --> 05:10:30.280
Hmm

05:10:30.680 --> 05:10:32.680
I barred where I please

05:10:32.680 --> 05:10:34.680
I barred where I please

05:10:36.840 --> 05:10:43.480
So if I died and like if I proceeded is this the continuance of

05:10:51.720 --> 05:10:53.720
Like what I used to get sent all the way back

05:10:53.720 --> 05:10:55.720
Oh

05:10:57.720 --> 05:11:04.120
Please you don't have to placate me. I'm not a child. I wasn't doing good. I could have been better

05:11:04.840 --> 05:11:06.840
um

05:11:08.840 --> 05:11:10.840
Because I want to go forward but I also don't

05:11:12.360 --> 05:11:14.360
Because I'm tired you go to bed

05:11:14.520 --> 05:11:16.840
Uh, I'll leave you here. I'll let my

05:11:17.640 --> 05:11:19.640
It goes to the next realm

05:11:19.640 --> 05:11:21.640
If I die in that realm

05:11:23.800 --> 05:11:26.680
Do I get sent to the hub or do I have to start level one?

05:11:32.280 --> 05:11:35.880
Okay, so if I die in level two

05:11:50.600 --> 05:11:52.600
If you die start back at one, uh

05:11:54.520 --> 05:11:56.520
You

05:12:00.760 --> 05:12:02.760
Then how do I get to the hub from here?

05:12:12.760 --> 05:12:14.760
Does that mean I would have to beat meg again

05:12:24.600 --> 05:12:25.720
I

05:12:25.720 --> 05:12:32.440
Thought the game would be a little bit more forgiving and then let you go on to the next level, but I guess it seems that you

05:12:39.960 --> 05:12:43.240
It's one try or bust so you literally have to almost make a run

05:12:45.240 --> 05:12:47.240
And

05:12:47.240 --> 05:12:55.240
And a single go damn, that's hard. Um

05:13:00.040 --> 05:13:02.520
We're under 30 minutes, okay

05:13:06.280 --> 05:13:08.280
Damn

05:13:12.680 --> 05:13:14.680
Hmm

05:13:17.400 --> 05:13:19.400
Okay

05:13:24.280 --> 05:13:28.920
We also have increasing benefits as you do it true you can become absolutely tapped

05:13:30.840 --> 05:13:32.440
All right

05:13:32.440 --> 05:13:37.880
Good to know you don't go to the hub. That's what the constructions are for to explain the floors variety

05:13:40.680 --> 05:13:42.680
What do you mean the floors variety

05:13:43.400 --> 05:13:44.680
Oh

05:13:44.680 --> 05:13:49.560
Wait, so like for like if you want more things to show up or like this to happen or that to happen. Okay

05:13:50.520 --> 05:13:53.240
I think we're in the first sub 20 minutes is doable

05:13:58.360 --> 05:14:01.320
So I have to do this three more times there's four levels

05:14:04.280 --> 05:14:06.280
Interesting

05:14:13.160 --> 05:14:17.000
So I ha I would have to go back and beat meg again if I die

05:14:19.160 --> 05:14:21.160
That's annoying

05:14:23.720 --> 05:14:26.840
Oh, it's like sisyphus. No, yeah

05:14:34.280 --> 05:14:36.280
I'm constructing a horse ring that we did

05:14:36.440 --> 05:14:38.440
Oh

05:14:39.880 --> 05:14:45.480
Zach can get hella broken. Okay. That's annoying. I don't want to fight her again

05:14:49.720 --> 05:14:52.440
And others okay, interesting

05:14:53.960 --> 05:14:55.960
Funny you say that

05:14:56.440 --> 05:14:59.480
All right, I'm gonna pause it here then so I don't fuck up or run

05:15:02.120 --> 05:15:04.120
Damn that sucks

05:15:06.360 --> 05:15:08.360
I

05:15:16.520 --> 05:15:17.960
Sick

05:15:17.960 --> 05:15:19.720
That was fun

05:15:19.720 --> 05:15:23.560
I like the game a lot. I did not realize how much I enjoy roguelites

05:15:25.000 --> 05:15:31.240
I know someone uh, I know straw knee was like I should play biting of Isaac since I like called the lamb and I was telling her

05:15:31.240 --> 05:15:33.240
She should play called the lamb since she was biting of Isaac

05:15:33.240 --> 05:15:35.240
Um

05:15:36.760 --> 05:15:39.960
Cool all right, thank you for uh

05:15:42.120 --> 05:15:50.680
You might find me enjoy your early spot. He was like, uh level four gross. Uh, not this place again

05:15:53.400 --> 05:15:58.360
Yeah, this is a great game. I didn't I'm wishing that I played it sooner

05:15:58.360 --> 05:16:05.560
It's really good. I really like the spear. I think the spear is my favorite

05:16:05.560 --> 05:16:07.160
I thought the bow was gonna be my favorite

05:16:07.160 --> 05:16:11.720
But uh, I just have to wait until I get those gloves because maybe who knows

05:16:13.720 --> 05:16:17.640
But I hope you guys have a good night. Hope you enjoyed. I'm sorry. Sometimes I would go to this non verbal

05:16:17.640 --> 05:16:21.000
I just like I sometimes I just need to focus and I can't

05:16:21.720 --> 05:16:23.720
Like um talk

05:16:23.800 --> 05:16:27.720
It's hard for me to like give commentary and I'm just like no I just I just need to

05:16:28.760 --> 05:16:30.760
Lock in bro

05:16:30.760 --> 05:16:32.760
um

05:16:33.400 --> 05:16:35.400
That was definitely

05:16:38.680 --> 05:16:43.960
That was definitely due to I'm learning how the boons work and what stacks well

05:16:45.560 --> 05:16:47.560
And that's good

05:16:50.280 --> 05:16:51.560
Let's wish I played it sooner

05:16:51.560 --> 05:16:56.040
I know because this game has been out for a bit and I've always I've seen the art of the character

05:16:56.440 --> 05:16:58.440
I didn't think I would like the

05:16:59.160 --> 05:17:03.560
Game style because I usually don't like birds. I view games

05:17:04.520 --> 05:17:07.240
And I I realize I just need to give games a chance

05:17:07.480 --> 05:17:13.320
I really do because I might not like because like again like I played balder's gate for like three hours sometimes

05:17:14.280 --> 05:17:15.720
um

05:17:15.720 --> 05:17:20.760
And I didn't end up liking it, but I bet if I tried again, I would like it a lot. I might try to play balder's gate

05:17:22.840 --> 05:17:24.840
I don't have a PC though. I have one from my playstation

05:17:26.040 --> 05:17:27.720
Same with um

05:17:27.720 --> 05:17:30.040
Call the lamb. I didn't think I'd like it. I ended up loving it

05:17:30.920 --> 05:17:34.920
And same with diablo. I had never played a diablo game before but I really really

05:17:35.800 --> 05:17:37.800
Like the concept of the latest diablo game

05:17:39.000 --> 05:17:42.520
And I ended up loving it. I was like, oh, let's just skyrim from a different viewpoint

05:17:44.600 --> 05:17:50.280
I hope you enjoyed the tutorial. Oh damn if that's a tutorial, I'm gonna get my ass handed to me

05:17:51.160 --> 05:17:53.160
I'm gonna go right back to the start

05:17:56.120 --> 05:18:01.640
Mm-hmm. The focus of the log kid makes it much easier. Okay. Sometimes I feel bad when I can't talk

05:18:02.280 --> 05:18:06.200
Uh, sometimes I just want to focus, but I'm glad you guys enjoyed

05:18:08.040 --> 05:18:10.040
One of my classes in the world loves ma'am

05:18:10.760 --> 05:18:12.760
That's all that scratching is

05:18:13.720 --> 05:18:17.640
Balder's gate was indulged my interest. I didn't know uh, you could play with like more than one person

05:18:18.600 --> 05:18:20.920
I thought it was like two people or something at the most

05:18:21.880 --> 05:18:25.640
But cool. All right, I'll see you guys. I'm gonna go to bed

05:18:25.720 --> 05:18:30.360
I wasn't gonna try to play elden ring after this, but I'm like, I think I'm good

05:18:32.200 --> 05:18:37.080
I was like, I don't think I'm ready to try to grind to kill those stupid virgin abdicators

05:18:37.880 --> 05:18:39.880
Uh, I'll probably do that in the morning

05:18:43.240 --> 05:18:45.240
But tomorrow's sunday

05:18:46.120 --> 05:18:48.120
Yeah, and I don't stream tomorrow. I'll probably

05:18:49.080 --> 05:18:56.680
I'll probably I might do a gorilla depends of elden ring. Um, I also need to clean my house

05:18:58.200 --> 05:19:02.680
I picked up a little bit today and I did my laundry, but I need to fold it and put away and that stuff

05:19:04.040 --> 05:19:09.960
Because I just I really want to get to the dlc. I'm like, I'm taking forever to get to the dlc. Um

05:19:11.720 --> 05:19:16.120
I'm excited to see like your promising app rabbit. Where's the app now have fun with the games? I don't know

05:19:17.080 --> 05:19:20.200
I don't know everybody watches streamers differently. So

05:19:21.560 --> 05:19:23.560
Yeah, have a good night everybody

05:19:25.400 --> 05:19:28.920

05:19:29.720 --> 05:19:31.800

05:19:32.520 --> 05:19:36.840
Uh, cuz toma is was actually she forgot she was doing a watch along

05:19:37.800 --> 05:19:39.080

05:19:40.520 --> 05:19:42.520

05:19:43.160 --> 05:19:49.480
But she she actually was ended up being busy. So we're doing it monday instead. I'm sorry. I should have tweeted that out. Um
