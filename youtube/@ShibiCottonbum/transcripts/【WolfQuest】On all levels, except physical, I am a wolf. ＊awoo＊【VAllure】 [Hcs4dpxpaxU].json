{"text": " I don't even know if you guys can hear the music. Alright, I'm back, I'm back even though I got back home earlier than I thought I would. Thank you guys for your understanding, I'm sorry I had to cut the stream I started initially short but everything's okay now, everything's good, everybody's good and safe and fine, I need a tweet, cause I always forget to tweet. Sorry, hey I was watching that, that just killed me a little bit, hey I was watching that. So I had Bulldog Ramen the other day, well like yesterday and my asshole was on fire, I'm sorry I had to tell you, I just thought you'd like to know you know, so I'm sitting on an ice cube and hoping for the best, hoping that I won't die, it was so delicious though so worth it, can I fire a napalm, probably, so you can show us your, hey Oshiba you hope everything is returning to normal so that you can show us your alpha side, and by the way don't have to postpone if you choose your sentence, I understand, well thank you, it's okay now, so silly family stuff that honestly has nothing to do with me but I'm just there to support in case, again my family is fine, I'm fine, I'm trying to get my fucking headphones on, oh my gosh, this wire is too short, off this satin water, that's what I get for sitting on an ice cube, these are my bucks cool man, am I allowed to talk about this, this is already gone, the thing is already demonetized, whatever, we out here having a great time on this lovely July evening, good morning, good night, good afternoon, I'm your host Shibi, butt is on firebomb, I should have said Shibi firebomb but it's fine, okay, I'm alive, whoa, oh god I can hear myself, can you guys hear me, is it an echo, I just wanted to be able to monitor my sound, I can hear myself and now there's two of me, two of me, two of me, I'm on a tin can, whoa that's demonetized, I'm cutting this out, I'm cutting this, the VOD's new, branding the street now, it ain't a Shibi stream without a little scuff, well of course this is a great game, you guys hear the music, Shibi bottom fire, that's me, this game looks wild as fuck because you're right, we're in the wild west baby, I'm just kidding I don't know, I forget what this takes place in Yellowstone, takes place in the wild Midwest baby, I don't remember, American school system failed me, kinda, okay I'll turn it up to them, oh, how many cubs do you cook in, we're gonna have so many cubs, again all the cubs, we're cub maxing the stream, I hate my life, try to think the only thing about these IEMs is that I can't, like it has a thing where it should let me turn down the volume with them but it's not letting me do that so I'm just gonna take one ear out, otherwise I can't hear anything, cub maxing, better call Icy, oh my god, alright, zitter, let's me tweet, honestly I almost don't feel like tweeting because I'm like if you know you know, if you know you know, okay we back, I don't know if I could put a link in a quote tweet but Twitter algorithm is fucking weird as hell, and earlier, we're back earlier, yeah I initially said six but I realized I was gonna be back sooner, please let me retweet my own post, thank you, oh my god, okay, so the game might be a little bit laggy because this in my model just don't play nice, well Quest is kind of notorious for that, it's like one of those games it just like takes up way too much power than it actually needs to be because it's like a decade old and it doesn't make any sense, is this considered a retro game, oh god, that just makes me feel bad furry, shut up Nori, shut up, I love you though, that's my girl Noriko she probably hates being pointed out now, she doesn't know that I gave her mod when she wasn't around she's drawing some very beautiful art of me, am I okay, oh I'm fine, I'm fine, it's just family stuff but everybody like my immediate family is fine, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, I think I'll help my mom or something where's mountain lion quest, that would be, oh my god, what was that game, oh my god, it was made by this character called, this person called Kobu and it was like literally like lion simulator and you can like do some really wacky, oh my god, it's like two hearts, oh my god, it's gonna bother me but I might play that too at some point, I'm just gonna like, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna furry max, I'm gonna weasel my way into the furry community, honestly some of the furry models that I've seen are really freaking cute, I think I saw her a bunny one or like a cat one or a dog one and I'm like that's actually adorable but it was like Moe, you know, it was cute, she means becoming a furry, that's the thing, I was always a furry though, I'm always angry, no I'm not a furry, I do, I do admire the art though, I'm not really into that, like I, I'm trying to think did I draw, no I only drew like, I never drew like anthropomorphic animals, I only drew like cat girls or just cats, I never like a combination of like going even deeper in it, she be furry bum, furry affiliate, oh yeah, no there's definitely, who are all the bunnies furries, I don't know, ask, ask, I don't know, hey man, does werewolf not count as a furry, I think that's its own thing, I respect furries a lot because it's not a chief hobby, honestly same and they make a lot of bank, okay if you, if you complain that my model lags, I'm gonna punch you, I don't care, it's gonna lag, my computer's old, I built it in 2017, leave me alone, yes, could a veeler bought me a computer, yeah but I didn't want to ask because I'd rather the money go towards something else, all right new game, um, I want to modify a wolf, wait, yeah we're gonna create a wolf, if it loads in, I don't, it just crashed, should I, am I have to turn into like a fucking PNG to play this, I love this game, I do, it's, it's close to my heart, but it just crashed, oh look there's two of me, hi, attempt number two, are you hypnotized, are you hypnotized, are you entertained, are you feeling it, shot of close jutsu, this should be head incident part two, okay is it gonna go back to wolf quest, police, oh no they'll make it that, there we go, perfect, okay let's turn down the game settings even more, we're gonna put them at fast, what fastest, perfect, everything is so, okay okay wait so this is the fastest version and then this is the stupendous version, it's actually quite pretty but my model can't move at all, so we're going to be playing like this, I have, yeah I have a 10 to 70s so I kind of like how ganky it looks because this is how I remember it, it looked like this, the grass was barely there, it was a texture on the ground, the trees were barely loaded in, actually hold on am I, I'm moving fine, what if I do, about fast, just so we can have, that looks a little bit better, that looks a little bit better, now we have some actual grass, so let's do, let's do a new game, create new wolf, see oh it's working, we're good, oh my god girl we need to get you a better pc, I will, don't worry I will eventually, I just want to, I have more things I want to do before I get a pc, I have paying off my debt first, I need to pay off my credit card and then I will get a pc, then I will put it on that credit card, get the points for it and then pay it off again because I am a, I'm a smart bunny, madam and debt, madam is, I was about to say the amount of debt, I don't really count school loans, it's fine, I'm not going to say because then someone's going to start like donating shit and I know that's not why I'm, I would bring it up, okay so I have, ooh life is rough pack, cutie Cinderella, oh my god that's such a pretty wolf, I have to buy the dlc, her name is 42f Cinderella but it's fine, white lady, that's what I am right now, I'm a white lady, pretty, these are actual wolves, I actually, it's funny because I, I love like learning about Yellowstone and stuff so I recognize some of these names because I remember I would, when I used to be a wolf role player, I was an avid wolf role player on WolfQuest and on like wiki foundry, aka wet paint and all that shit, we would take the photos from like the famous wolf pictures and like that would be our OC, like this is my wolf character, so it's funny that I, like the, the founder ones I recognize, it's just, it's just because I was just such a, I just really liked wolves because I liked their pack mentality, like the family, what happened to him, life is rough pack, oh he just has freaking mange, I don't want that, it's kind of badass, as long as you don't sleep with the fishes, I was a lone wolf in the game, related wolf, what, you know cats, does it entail like normal death, wolf looks like ice, yeah she's the white one that did, if, if icy was a wolf, she would be this one, this would be her, it's so cute, um I, so there's different pack types and there's different um coat types because wolves come in a variety of coat colors, um I like this one because it looks like me, because we are both like blondish, why is this one named Brad Pitt, hold on let me move myself over a little bit, let me make myself a little bit smaller, because I'm blocking a lot of stuff, my big ass hand, you indulge collab game, oh my god, mischief null, maybe I'll name her that, um okay, let's make her, I can make myself, oh fuck, there's so much like before, it used to be like a little wolf and then like a splash page over here on this side, you can't see my mouse, I don't know why I'm just string, on the left side and then you would just have to pick a color, you couldn't do all this cool shit or it wasn't based off of actual wolves, um I can give myself some fucked up eyes, holy shit, I can miss an eye, like I'm winking at you, I kind of like that, like I'm a little like, I'm winking, I'm winking, uh thank you Charlie for the donut, wolves and dogs are actually the same species, canis lupus, dogs are substance of the wolf, you think if I am a, I love wolves and I wouldn't know that but thank you for the information in the super, I do know, I already knew that, yes, um my cats are playing in my pants that I took off and I need to put some pants back on actually because my, my hoo-ha is cold, okay let me find one, just sit here, sure, hi, can you

I will come back pregnant we are wolves, we run it, oh yeah, what the hell is that, tick tock sound, I'm all cringing so hard on that, wait did I just hear a, am I tripping, did I just hear a voice oh wait it's my neighbors, okay that just scared the shit out of me, I found somebody I'm like am I, am I going insane, Texas speech is very loud oh it was the Texas speech that I heard, that makes sense, it must be loud then, um I can turn that down a bit but then you guys won't really hear the music thank you Ninkadargui, shibii cute, thank you for the anonymous tip, 20 dollars debt, cough, PC fault you guys are too good okay, mademoiselle had a male voice, yeah I thought, and I realized yeah it was a Texas speech because I'm like am I tripping, the AI thought I was a streamer for some reason, must be signed, that's, what, thank you for the other five dollars, um let me turn, because yeah you guys can't hear the music at all if I turn that down yeah I know you don't hear any music, it's because I put it down because it's really loud but I guess I'll put it up more because it's for some odd reason, it just doesn't it's fine, I didn't get far can you hear now thank you expose me for dochi, oh I fucking love dochi, if you like dojikai you like dochi yeah yeah okay I think the Texas speech is gonna be loud, I'm not sure, I'm scared I'm terrified, it's gonna happen, oh thank you

go see that's like everybody must be green, thank you, hopefully some of the people that have been hoping to be randomly gifted will get it because they're just like I'm poor and I'm like that's okay and then that one person that just like kept getting missed over and over again when people were just like dumping gifted that was me, congrats everybody's like the great names are just like sad don't worry, don't worry you're still appreciated, you're still appreciated, you showed up today that's all I care about, um gray wolves coming out, the grays versus the greens, it's house of the wolves instead of house of the dragon, if you were in a Game of Thrones house what would you do, oh it's your lucky day, some of you, it's your lucky day, thank you authorities, one of you got hit, that's good there he goes, dubs in the chat boys, dubs in the chat, if I was in Game of Thrones house I would leave I feel like I would be like appearance wise, one there's like no brown people except in over the seas in um what should I call it, wherever Melisandre is from, no that's the red woman, Melisandre, Misandre is from but I feel like I would be in house motel based off of appearance if it was a house but I would I would prefer, I would probably be based off of my model obviously a fucking lannister like let's be real like I can't like a red and blonde come on like and then Amy would also be a lannister because like kissing your sister and stuff so gotta keep it, I gotta keep it in the family but if I would, I would probably, I would obviously, I'd probably be a star because I like the winner a lot, Dorne, yes Dorne, I'm a Dorne-ish gal, who house the dragon mansion, oh there's a new episode tonight guys, I was like yelling at my dad because he forgot to pay our subscription because I just like steal my parents subscriptions for streaming services and like dad you did not pay the HBO he's just like sorry I'll work on that I'm like so I hope it's freaking fixed today and trying to be daughter of the kraken you mean she would be house um fuck what house was he from fuck I can't remember the houses HBO, I'm like HBO no thank you, only decent lannisters with two brothers, Greyjoy, yes thank you should be house Greyjoy that name never made sense to me for the house name like I just it really didn't okay well if you guys your eyes your ears are gonna bleed if you hear the stream elements thing so it sucks for you guys but people can scream their names their their their truth from my text to speech because they don't feel like fiddling with that

what's accurate damn Jesus fuck eastern dens western dens I think I played eastern dens before so I'll do western dens um when I played this in my PO show only iron walls I don't even know what the fuck that means what the fuck is an iron wall okay I think that's is that like the current pack that's dominating yellowstone wouldn't it be Targaryen since they married or something's true but she's blonde like in terms of like appearance she'd be a lannister icy would be free folk 100% icy would be free folk iron wolves if you die you die oh really why does it say show only iron wolves then well um let me get down here please oh no it crashed again oh she's back she's back everybody it's fine I got nervous it's cool let's just turn her this way um I'm female thank you just a miniscule smaller

wolf king of the gun gile yeah showbo no dark see exactly dark fang gold fang you want it's like the warrior cat's naming you have to I think the last time I named when I played on my pl I named it after one of my first wolf quest characters which was sorrow song because that's badass um and it's funny because he was a dude he was just a little emo boy um and I also had death song because I was just hard core uh fanatos crayon I don't know why I named her that mitzuko I had so many like wolves evil needs more edge exactly I have like I think I took a picture of all the names of my wolves I had like 50 from across all my characters from wolf role playing my favorite one's name and the one I used the most was wait I can't even spell it erotomanthias because in um when I'm like the like thing for wolf role playing on wet paint wet paint a week of foundry was that you had either a super fucking long name that was like greek inspired or it was something edgy like that bark follow me yeah it was after it was a riff of erotomanthias yes um and remember when I said I also had a character named Arta Xerxes maybe I should just make a male wolf no I want it to be me I need to think of a cool but I didn't play a lot of female wolf characters for whatever reason it's just easier posing to be a guy online because then you just get harassed when you're a woman so it's just like yeah I'm a dude um I'm trying to think of the girl I think I had Cersei for one of the girl names this is not like Cersei like from Game of Thrones like actual Greek mythology Cersei um actually a death song was female I saw as mitzuko guys give me a color wolfrodiety that's pretty good pandora andromeda that's pretty cool atlanta please the guys give me give me give me a color madamantius char truce

We're taking this over Can I howl? Oh wait, I have to find their set marker in this hex. That's what it is Hmm, where is their set marker? That's our pack. Do I get to name my pack? How am I supposed to find this fucking thing? Cougar Rescue Creek Wolfpack Hmm Yeah, it's probably this way then Oh, wait, no, what were they going into my pack territory? Oh, they were Fucking cunts We gotta teach them a lesson Oh, that's a cougar nevermind. I thought it was a wolf. Don't worry about it I'm using I better been just passing through All right fine Going back up here. Can you find this fucking set marker?

It doesn't matter. It's a cool tree to piss on As they fall down a fucking hill We're going after this pack we're taking their fucking territory It's like fucking jenga I wonder if we can because again When I played this game When I was younger you could it was up to the point where you could have puppies and that was it and then they It's either that you let them live or they died, but you couldn't like expand the pack after that So if you can that's very cool to me Oh that thing just fucking juked me.

We're fine We are going to look how big the moon is over there We're fucking yapping we're gonna go up and then across What uh Or all these coyotes just hanging out it's kind of weird. They're just like waiting for us to leave I guess Or being chased by the coyotes, I don't What the hell I don't even know I don't they must They're very loud The alert girls from a pack. Oh that'd be fun. What's our pack? I don't even have a pack name It doesn't let you name the pack. I think when I get puppies, I can name the pack Okay, we're almost there Let me have to find their fucking scent marker and take back the hexagon I feel like I'm playing like What is that game? Strutego or fucking risk.

Actually, yeah, it's that's more apt I don't know how I don't see a marker. Wait, did I just see one? No, I'm just fucking tripping Because it's What is that? Oh, it's a carcass. I smell Like what does the x stand for because usually it's like It'll be a purple marker and they don't have a lot of colors in here just right here Renew that then we're back in here This is really just pissing simulator Okay, we're taking this back though just good So yeah, you can take stuff back by like howling peeing and just your presence there We have to get 15 hexes at at least 50 strength in order for us to have puppies Hi boomie And I'm trying to take over this fucking hexagon because they stole it from me from before I think if we go up this way we should be good It's funny because I haven't seen any other wolves you think you'd see them like renewing shit Boomy sweetie, what are you doing? It's like so she's sitting on my desk and staring at nothing Oh my god purple pack stop being assholes Something like this for for wild cats Uh What is that is it like two hearts?

Let's fucking go piss Too soon relax. All right, then we're gonna go up boomy sweetie. I can't see past your girth Your booty's in the way Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, we pissed off this cool tree That's right cool tree pissing It's a sick ass tree.

Like did I beat the fucking? I needed them at 50 50 strength. Oh my god Okay, then I literally just have to go to the ones on the top and do that. Okay fine. Hopefully they'll let us finish Because I'm tired of running around I've literally been running around peeing for like the last two hours This is my least favorite part of this game is the hex game mechanic Because things should not run out after four fictional hours When your wolf sleeps for eight Go up here And it takes such a long time to run across a hex Need a dispenser as a cast I thought you were finishing like hair in this week So close I can almost taste it Release your inhibition cool That's cool. Okay, perfect and then I can just cross into this one. All right, I'm on the edge. Perfect Perfect. Okay. You've established a good territory. I found several potential dents. You and your mate are truly a pack now So give your pack a name or ask for suggestions Don't include pack a name as that will be added automatically suggest a name rebel pack Tofacious pack prowler pack that sounds creepy as fuck Fang pack hope creek pack that sounds pretty cool actually Overlook fossil forest sleet galaxy slit stone ayo Woke up Why do you give me slit stone twice? Pawsome Hush, what are these fucking names pouncer pack? Why are they like tofacious so much? Whitewater whitewater possum scar blizzard yogurt Yogurt pack The bum hunters pack pack his pack I'm bringing piss pack I'm bringing sexy pack. Okay. I think that's a good name I think that's a great name I'm bringing sexy But except instead of back it's pack Can I do a comma? No, I'm bringing sexy pack Choose a den Oh, fuck You've established a territory in the slopes of anthos mountain But remember you must maintain it even when your pups require all your time and attention great Smaller your territory the more likely stranger wolves be tempted to come in and kill your pups great It's most efficient mercury when hexes have dropped to 30 or 40 strength Plane your hunting trips so you can mark hexes along the way I don't think actual wolves have to deal with this Find a den. Okay. I haven't gotten this far since I played the game a long time ago So we'll see you see that twitter torrent of youtube or animations dancing to that song Yes, I did. That's why I put in a sexy pack I'm bringing sexy pack yet Your pups will be born soon and the snows begin to melt it's time to find a good dead site There's no need to dig a new dent for yourself since there are many potential sites out there Cool, cool, cool How to find a den they look different now the snow is melted Okay, now dens will emit float scents like before why didn't they do that before Remember the dens are always in south facing slopes to catch as much as the spring sunshine. That's very cool. I didn't know that Um, okay, so the they should already be marked for me Show all dens. Oh, they're all down there. I'd rather have one up here are in the middle I think I'm gonna try to find one towards the middle I didn't mean to pee but that's fine It's fine I should probably Yeah, let's go across I'm gonna try to find a den up here. I want one in the middle of the hexes So I can just go into a circle when I want to It's pop max in time Oh look at the bison they'll probably fucking kill us. I'm how am I going the wrong way? That doesn't make any fucking sense to me I Don't wait I'll just piss here again Thanks husband Imagine you're just like an elk and you're just chilling with like hanging out with your herd You see these wolves just run by and fucking piss everywhere then run away I'm not going after them. I'm just trying to get to the hexagon. Please. Let me get to the right hexagon Perfect Cool, I'm not gonna bother with that one up top Let's see Although would be well It's fine Let's go down here. Although if I do do one of the dens at the bottom I can literally probably just take out that entire corner for myself But that would take so much fucking time. I'm not I'm not feeling that Had I known the dens are all in this bottom part. I would have done that but they don't tell you that Let's see. I want to find more dense. Okay. There's some over here. Well, well because they're far away They're probably just showing up as a marker Tell me there's no dens nearby Tell me there's no dens around here in the center, which would be perfect for me You fucking bitch I I'm bringing sexy pack. Did you just killed me? Sorry. What is Oh, what the hell? I'm sorry One two three four. Okay. I thought they were showing five for some reason Is there another one no Wow I'm bringing sexy pack Sorry, I'm just so proud of myself for that Okay, it looks like I'll be have to be four. Oh dens nearby dens nearby Where Oh, we want to fucking sorry. You're in the middle of howling. Let's howl together Is there pvp in this game? I don't know. I don't remember if you could ever like try to kill other wolves This is dead nearby but like where It's not changing color Oh sit down this way Oh seems like it I don't see anything saying it's around here facing the south I Wanted one in the middle There's not a lot of cover, but maybe that would make it easier to keep track of the puppies Try to think of what's best for my children. Okay Oh, we're close we're close. We're fucking close. Is that it? Is rocket Please let this big-ass rock be it Yeah, yeah, uh, no That's what the fuck bro Saying it's like right over here. I don't fucking see anything Oh My god, I'm literally losing it I bet it's next to a fucking tree that I just can't see Is This is this fucking tree it I don't fucking know is that it what is this This is a wooded den the trees How is more ground cover than open dens giving potatoes like cougars and faces to hide the attacker pups from What do you mean what wooded cover How There's no wooded cover. What are you fucking talking about? I can oh What the hell are we gonna live in a dirt pile Whoa, what the fuck I don't want this den I don't want this den I don't want that 10 10 is ugly No, I don't want it How do I kind of cancel I don't want this fucking dirt pile to be my house I don't want the fucking dirt Cuck dirt Oh, I'll name it cuck dirt I Won't let me get out of this Okay, I love the game last out of safe Oh, oh, look at the little baby little fucking cougar bocats whatever they are Okay, I don't want that to be my den I think um I think I'm gonna look for the I like aesthetics I go to the nearest one I Let them one down here Those coyotes are loud and annoying I liked that tree one Or the one in the rock was pretty good, but it'll be open for birds I I don't think that was a factor the last time I played this game. You had to like worry about things Now I have to find Rettucar property. Wait, did they? Oh, they did Oh, it's whatever it's fine. It's not a priority right now. It's not a priority What the fuck oh, let's go to the piss right here Act so strong Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna mark it anyways Okay, so there's a den right here. Am I fucking tripping? Was this one also the one that was in the ground? What Oh This is nice So that would be a good one To open den with little no tree and ground cover What Why isn't let me know tree and ground cover. It's right near some trees that one's good. That's a good choice I don't really believe oh Maybe there's more trees that are gonna appear because the other one didn't have trees How's the rent and amenities exactly those are important things to consider I It's gonna pass I wish I would like have an icon above showing where they actually were Is it over here? This one. Yes, it was over here. It was over here. I bet this one's also gonna mention like ground cover shit What a den It doesn't have any ground cover I like this one because it's like it's a cute little place for the pups to play and it's a great view You can see the sunrise in the morning You know, I'll howl with you baby boob There's a washer giant unit. I know that's very important Um, so that means the other one's all the way over there I Okay, let's Okay, I have to run I'm tired I'm probably gonna fucking pass out from exhaustion I just want to go to those last one just to see what the coverage is Should I deal with a cougar than an eagle? I don't know Because I feel like like with an eagle I could just like scare it off Um, whereas with the cougar I'd probably have to fucking fight it off I like this one because it's by the water, you know, very beautiful lake side. I mean riverside I bet it's gonna say that's open Where is it? Where is it? I don't want to go so fast What the fuck is it? Am I tripping? I'm like right on top of it, but I don't see it Out here it is See this is a fancy fucking looking den What it done More ground cover. You know what? I'm going with this one because it's cool You can go pick up your pumpkin dip. That's true Um, what should we call it? Snaggle rock, although it's a not that what should we call it? This is a cool ass den This music is nice Epic not done. No! Nottingham den? There's gonna be children living here. Cool ass den. That's a pretty cool But would it be like den den? Like would it add another den at the end? Cool ass den I can't believe I birthed like that earlier. I'm still it's terrifying me I Tying the knot I like pup max Pup pump max The pup maxing den Oh, they'll be arriving soon. We're gonna have babies It's my birthday. Wow Uh, age perks review the available age perks for your next year of life decide if you want to advance in age If so select three perks in advance Note that only one new years of age works active at the time. They don't come in at your lifetime. Okay Probably never been to your birthday too means you've survived another year as a wild wolf. I'm three years old about to have babies That's not bad. Sometimes good. Sometimes not review your choices and decide if you want to stay advanced or stay as I am So I can just stay as my age. How does that work? So I can get more stamina Be more damage or in tracking paying competitors. I can be a fun parent Pups never get tired of socializing More likely to have a large litter of pups sick pups are more likely to the competitor. What the fuck? I want that It's called clout. I want some clout. I want out. I want clout So I can pick three I don't really care about that. Um, I'll do these What can I Stay my age I gotta advance age three Advance vigil these new perks for the coming year. You cannot go back to your younger self. Yeah, that's fine Oh After nine weeks of gestation They look just like me. If your pups are born and dead blind and deaf They weigh one pound each your pups may remain in the den for several weeks eating sleeping pepper. We do it out Three weeks. They first emerged in the den in the sunlight. They're dark brown now a few weeks of puppy coats will end up Oh, okay. Why should we name though? I have babies. Look how cute my babies are Blimey stop trying to chew my fucking headphones You're ruining the moment Wait, I could just name them after my hold on. I'm naming them after my cats Oh my god, there's really two girls and a boy Bro I'm gonna cry Oh Shapa shabu shabu shubu It's literally two girls and a boy. Oh, it's boomy rain and fia. Oh wait, but if my pets die I'm gonna be very upset if if I have to keep these puppies alive at all fucking costs guys We're going to do it I can tell them to come with me to come here go home. Oh, okay Now four weeks old your pups are too big for the den as they spend their days playing outdoors socializing them playful emotes Get my pack if they're playful if they're hungry feed them straight for them go find them and carry them back Pups mostly eat me regurgitated by you and your mate What I'm about to Baby bird this shit into your mouth. You must protect them from predators You may see a wolf pup is an easy target keeping your pups until they weigh 15 pounds Cool Especially as they're both your pups Go find food eat it and then regurgitate it And you go hunting wolf to tell your pups to stay in the den usually stay there like on but affinity is low Like to come out before you're turned. Oh, okay Oh god, and I still have to maintain the fucking hiss the thing Your fee is oh, oh my god, little fia Hi fia Oh my god, it's my baby Sorry, I didn't mean to bump you.
