Hello, sir. I've been really busy today. I've been cleaning and taking care of a baby Fia. So

27
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,080
Busy

28
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,240
He's been a good boy today

29
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,240
I

30
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:58,280
Just staring at my slippers. I went to go find my slippers too, and I found one

31
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,520
On one side of the bed and I was like, where's the other one and I look under the bed

32
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:09,320
And I'm pretty sure a boomy had taken it under the bed and it was like I had to like crawl under the bed to get my other

33
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,280
Slipper is there any cake left? Yeah, there's no cake left

34
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,600
So cake left. Oh my god

35
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,600
I don't know if you heard that thump noise I bent down the pet boomy and he got scared

36
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,360
He's been really skittish

37
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,200
Do I need to like get you on anxiety medication, dude? Are you okay?

38
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,280
He's a skittish little boy

39

Yeah, Fia Fia is doing okay, she hasn't I had to um

Pure ray her food and

41
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:57,080
Kind of force feed her because she's very weak right now. It's hard for her to um

42
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:01,280
To eat. Oh boomy. Are you gonna lay in the bed in the kitchen?

43
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,640
Why do you face that way

44
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,920
Why are you leaning so much under the bed?

45
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:17,880
Let's see if let's give the people what they want

46
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:26,720
Why everybody truly came here it was for boomy

47
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,040

89

95
00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:00,280
But I wanted to kind of like give you that option because I did I also like my last few streams

96
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:04,360
Um, I haven't been able to stream because I've been taking care of my kitty cat fia

97
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:11,480
And if you don't know hi if you're new here, uh, my kitty cat fia has a unique uh disease where she occasionally

98
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,120
Uh, she usually recovers

99
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,120
Um, this depends on the speed

100
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:22,920
She gets paralyzed for the neck down because her body can't send the right chemical signals to make her body move

101
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:28,680
So I've just been taking care of her and she is my sweet little special needs kitty and I love her pieces

102
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,760
She is named after uh fia the deathbed companion ironic

103
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,760
I know

104
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,760
When I named her that I didn't know if she was like this

105
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,000
Um, but I do snuggle with her all the time. Um

106
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:46,840
She's my little snuggle companion, uh, yeah, and um

107
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,280
So yeah, I just wanted to give people some background

108
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:58,360
But yeah, what I was saying I haven't been streaming a lot because of that and I just did like a collab and

109
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,600
Membership streams, so I wanted to make sure that I was like people

110
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,240
Although I'm dressed as a nun right now people still know who I am

a different sort of

118
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:45,320

You know, it's fun to dress up for streams

127
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,600
Even if it doesn't make sense like me being a nun right now

00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,600
And then I should also go to

174
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,560
Uh

175
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,560
What the heck is his name everything starts with g. Yeah, I need the shackle. Um

176
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:22,120
If you summon here, I'm in the dlc should they refer to me? No, you can use dlc weapons again

177
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,080
I will probably I only will really

178
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:33,320
Like I'll attempt bosses by myself first before I call you guys in like I've already seen so much gameplay of all the bosses

179
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:39,480
I've been watching um that one twitch streamer uh bushy for like like all of their runs

180
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:44,120
And I I'm pretty sure I've memorized mogue's moveset by now

181
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:51,080
I hope so I watched so many gameplay videos. I better have gotten better just by absorbing things

182
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,960
Um

183
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,880
Godfrey yes, uh that she had godfrey's ghosty ghosty boo

184
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,760
for uh the talisman pouch

185
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
um

186
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,600
Yes

187
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:16,200
But yeah, I know like so it's been widely known that this dlc is like the hardest

188
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:22,440
dlc or content game content that from software has put out so I probably will need your help

189
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,320
Oh my god guys, I got ice cream and it was a bad idea to eat it

190
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:31,800
I was like having a couple bites before stream and now my tummy does not feel good

191
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,720
My tummy is not doing too hot

192
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:41,720
Well, let's play a password. Yeah, I believe it's like she be I'm pretty sure it's just she be um

193
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,560
Yeah, I'm fine. Don't worry about it

194
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:54,520
For my stomach against so I'm thinking yeah, I haven't had ice cream in months. I wanted ice cream

195
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,880
Don't don't don't yell at me. Don't yell at me

196
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,080
Don't yell at me

197
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,920
Yeah, I bet I've seen gameplay of concert redawn. Um

198
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:09,480
I'm the type of person who I like to learn about everything before I start something

199
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,840
But it's still like I still don't even know how to get to the dlc

200
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:18,280
I've only seen gameplay of like the boss fights. That is the and only like the remembrance bosses as well

201
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,080
um

202
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:27,400
Yeah, a lot of like the normal I like because I know like the dancing lion is like the first boss technically that you run into

203
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,480
but yeah

204
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:34,360
Why didn't you take lactate because I like to I like to put torture myself

205
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,200
boomy

206
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,840
I want to spin you so people can see your doofy face

207
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,520
um

208
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,360
There's no trick getting to that you'll figure it out. Yeah, I'm assuming so

209
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,760
So

210
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:55,240
Patches concert to me is actually a canonical final boss. Um, but like I don't know

211
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,880
How to move around. I don't know the names of the cities. I don't know anything about the weapons

212
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,760
um, I'm only looked at like the lore for like like, um

213
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,760
mikala and redawn and

214
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:15,080
Miedra, whatever the heck his name is. Is his name Miedra? The one with the frenzy flame dude. I can't remember his name ever

215
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,320
um

216
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,720
I'm pretty sure I'm getting confused with the Zelda character. It's whatever

217
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,560
uh

218
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,560
and uh mesmer

219
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,880
Uh

220
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,840
boomy

221
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,000
You're breathing so loud. Are you snoring?

222
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,280
Excuse me

223
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:38,360
Excuse me, sir. You're being really noisy. You're breathing too loud. It's triggering me

224
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,360
Okay

225
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,080
He stopped

226
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,400
Um

227
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:58,120
I'm very excited for the bosses

228
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,840
She be hands

229
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,200
Or um

230
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:09,640
Do you want to play be guided to experience as much as lore is possible because npc class has so many dumb stuff

231
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,680
Uh, we'll see. I look I kind of like I like the I used to hate

232
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:19,560
But I kind of came to love it is the non-linear stuff. I don't need to look at the lore stuff

233
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:23,160
I already know everything about the lore stuff to be honest with you. Um

234
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:28,200
But yeah, the nails me popping is popping is popping

235
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,720
It's popping my nails match Reina's eyes

236
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,880
Boomi's eyes are a little bit icier. I see your blue

237
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:46,120
The one time boomi's not menace. She accuses of breathing. I'm starting to believe boomi

238
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,960
Oh, sorry, did I tickle your head? Probably deserved it

239
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Yeah, he's been pretty okay today. I was I was surprised. I'm like, wow, you're so well-behaved, sir

240
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Um

241
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,920
What

242
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:16,440
What do you mean was messed up like do you mean like like millennia and stuff because like I know about that like her stuff

243
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,840
No millennia america

244
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,600
Everybody has georgia or martin needs to stop naming people

245
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:29,400
Boomi's never a menace. He's always been accused of false charge just because he's good right now

246
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:35,240
He steals food from this disabled. I don't know what to tell you. He stole his sister's food

247
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,960
And you guys just excuse him for that I don't understand

248
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,920
um

249
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:46,280
He did probably I know I know for a fact he missed me the most

250
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,400
um, he like he

251
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,320
uh

252
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,320
He never comes and sits on my lap

253
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,040
and

254
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:01,240
Because he's a very much like I want to be in the same room as you cat and I'll let you pet me sometimes

255
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,680
But he uh, and he'll be like picked up and stuff, but he won't like

256
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:09,320
Sit on top of you or snuggle on your chest or anything. Um

257
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,800
and

258
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,800
he

259
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:19,480
And he came and he sat on my lap and like snuggled there for a very long time and I was like

260
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,360
aw

261
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:27,240
Okay, I can tell you really miss me and when I came home he started screaming

262
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:34,120
And boomi's like you've heard boomi like yeah, but he'll be like like all that stuff, but he was like full on like

263
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,760
And then fio was just like stuck to me like a like velcro

264
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:48,120
I would wake up and she was just like on my chest and I was like, I can't breathe

265
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:54,600
And then reina too reina likes to lay on my shoulder if he likes to be on my chest and boomi likes to lay on my feet

266
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,840
Um

267
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,040
I try my best I try my best to be a good mom

268
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,560
So, uh, what should we do first?

269
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:12,920
So one obviously we have to spec stuff. I don't even know. I don't know anything about the dlc weapons

270
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,160
I didn't look up anything. I literally only know the word

271
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,400
And so we got to get the shackle. We're gonna get the talisman pouch

272
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,360
And then we got to kill mog

273
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,640
And I think that's it. And then I think we can just launch into the dlc

274
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,960
What build am I thinking? I don't even remember what build I was going for

275
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,720
I think I was doing this. I've never done like been a sorcerer. So I'm pretty sure I I

276
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,200
Uh, I'm doing a sorcerer build

277
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,640
No, I'm not doing strength intelligence

278
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,640
Although that's just a good baseline to have going in

279
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:53,720
I think I'm level like 60 now or 65 and then I got enough levels for 130

280
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,080
me thinks

281
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,080
Yeah

282
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,960
Put everything to luck

283
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,520
It was a dex intelligence

284
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,320
I was actually

285
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:11,400
I feel like I was pretty across the board with my dex intelligence and my um

286
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,640
Whatchamacallit

287
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:19,160
Strength because I know I needed more strength to wield moon veil. Okay, let's make my headphones on

288
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,760
Max don't eating. Yeah

289
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,360
Yeah

290
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:34,360
Imagine the game didn't save the runes, uh, then I won't play

291
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,440
I will literally end the stream and I will walk away

292
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,440
Okay

293
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,440
Hooper

294
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,440
He's a little guy. Um

295
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,440
Let me turn my game volume down

296
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:53,560
Is the game volume okay for you by the way, I will leave with no hesitation

297
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,360
and then

298
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,800
I will just offline just grind four million runes again

299
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,560
I just clicked new game

300
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,640
Hold on let me get out of the way shall I?

301
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,640
So you can see that's how many runes I have actually maybe I should just come over here

302
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,280
You guys don't really need to see my

303
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:26,200
I'll put myself in the middle and see you guys constantly see I'm just like running through

304
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,240
Wait, what does that look like? I want to see now

305
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,520
Oh

306
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,680
That looks so disorienting

307
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:53,080
If I had a 3d model this would be fun because then I would I would literally just like turn it

308
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,640
I would just flip my 3d model and just make it

309
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,160
I would just make it um

310
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,560
I'm behind like I'm running through stuff

311
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:11,080
It's like I'm sitting behind a tall person at the cinema that's funny

312
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:17,080
All right, uh, I don't think anybody cares about my runes then

313
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,600
Nobody cares about the side of the screen

314
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:35,800
What does get up I should use a faith build? No, I've been literally I was a faith

315
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,280
dex build

316
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,800
When I played my own like I might by myself on my playstation

317
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,960
um

318
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:49,320
Because I did I use the halo scythe and a lot of um

319
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:56,120
Faith and incantations so let me just sit down actually

320
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,840
I

321
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,360
Wish the nuns and kindergarten was pretty

322
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,840
Uh

323
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:15,560
Oh, okay, I'm level 54. Okay. I thought I was much higher. Um, so I have 4,260,909

324
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,840
Uh, what should I put stuff into?

325
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,160
Do

326
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:28,520
What should be the minimum level of vigor that I should have going into the dlc

327
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,440
54 that's it. Well, yeah, I've been speed running

328
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,120
Okay

329
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:52,680
I'll do 60 bigger than

330
00:33:56,520 --> 00:34:01,800
No, I need 60 we all know here that I would need 60

331
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:08,280
And so remember I'm doing intelligence as well. So I have intelligence

332
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:13,560
Okay, actually I'm technically doing like an intelligence dex build. Um

333
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:30,600
I'm so sorry to scare you with my gamer subs boomy. Here you go, boomy. This is a great product placement

334
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:40,280
Yep, and I know I yeah, I know about the scatter tree blessings. I know they do like shadow levels or whatever they're called

335
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:44,200
I'm not super again. I haven't played the dlc. I've only seen lore of the dlc

336
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,760
Um

337
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:51,640
This is not which you can't just do a game or something. Uh

338
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,400
And have your armor I

339
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:07,480
Don't know vigor means nothing compared to the scatter tree fragments. Yes, because from what I know they reduce

340
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,240
Damage

341
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,640
Taken and they increase damage given

342
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,920
I'm even tempted

343
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,440
to like speed run and get as many scatter but the thing is

344
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,320
the scatter tree blessings are also

345
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:29,560
Pretty dangerous to get to like I could probably get one shotted by trying to run someplace

346
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,480
Okay 70

347
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,440
That's true. I would probably would need

348
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
70

349
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,800
Because a lot of them need 70 anyways

350
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,920
But that doesn't leave a lot

351
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:02,920
Frank I'm actually might just do 60 for that

352
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,920
Yo

353
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:13,800
Yeah, that's why I can't so uh, I'm doing an intelligence build. I have no

354
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,760
Idea what that means in terms

355
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:23,160
But I was I'm doing an intelligence build because one I haven't done that before and two I heard those really fun sorceries in

356
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,960
The dlc that I want to try

357
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:35,400
I do not have I'm assuming you mean Ronnie's hat. I don't have Ronnie's hat. That's a good point

358
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,160
I would have what I would have to really

359
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:43,480
progress and Ronnie's quest line and I haven't done that. I don't think

360
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,160
I have a moon veil katana

361
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,400
It requires sacrifice if skibbity fragment

362
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:59,160
No, renala for the entire oh, I must okay. I'm assuming that renala

363
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,520
Is in the dlc

364
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,200
No

365
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,360
Yes, I can't remember their freaking names

366
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,160
I

367
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,000
renala

368
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,640
Ronnie's for ice magic. Okay, renala is

369
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,560
Related to the horse lady, right?

370
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,920
Or is she the horse lady?

371
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,960
It's like ronola

372
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,840
No, I already have the moon veil katana guys

373
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:41,400
Renala's sister. Yeah, ronola, renala. Who the fuck is there? I'm gonna. I mean, I said fuck

374
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,600
By the way

375
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,520
Are you cheating the stream? Yeah, I'll tweet the stream when I actually get into stuff

376
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:05,000
My friend did a sorcery and they worked pretty well until redon humbled him. Well, I'll probably be using

377
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,360
I actually haven't seen a lot of the consort redon fight

378
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:17,880
Besides like don't get close. So I'm probably gonna use a lot of distance magic like I have knight comet

379
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,080
Dex makes me cast faster

380
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,040
So, you know what I'll do? I'll probably do like

381
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:34,440
55 just so I have more stuff

382
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,120
Intelligence I can get talismans

383
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:43,000
I know I need more of this

384
00:38:43,160 --> 00:39:02,920
It's like generally hard spreading things a month, but like I can respect like I did kill I didn't kill her. I did be um

385
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,080
You know

386
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,800
So

387
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,720
Yeah

388
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:25,480
I know yeah, he like really jumps over to you. I've seen like a couple gameplay, but I haven't like watched it a bunch

389
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:34,280
I could always get a talisman for endurance

390
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,240
I

391
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,400
Sorry, I'm just seeing how much I

392
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,800
Like I'm literally wondering if I should do something like that

393
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:15,160
This is hard for me because I do like odd numbers, but I also like divisibles of five. So I'm like

394
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,400
But I can't I can't make it a divisible of five

395
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,800
Yeah

396
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:37,080
Yeah, I like that's why I'm not I'm not too worried about armor sets

397
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,760
I am worried about like stamina for casting

398
00:40:42,760 --> 00:41:01,240
I'm sorry, Reina is scratching in her scratching post. That's what that pinging is in the background. She's like slamming it. Um

399
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:07,800
I'm wondering if I should go with 50 bigger instead

400
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,880
I'm gonna do like that much

401
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,160
I

402
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:23,160
Think this will be fine. I think I feel good about that. What do you guys think?

403
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,840
Reina is strong. You have no idea

404
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,760
I

405
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:50,200
Big laser strap. Yeah, I can always like I like I'll probably going forward focus on

406
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
vigor just like leveling vigor

407
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,400
um

408
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,440
You think I should drop in by five and add it to decks

409
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,800
That's true. I don't have a lot of sorceries

410
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,560
You're thinking more dead. Okay. You're also thinking more decks

411
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:26,440
I know yeah, I know knight calm. I don't I'm not gonna run knight calm at a lot. It'll be there, you know

412
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:32,120
Uh decks for casting speed

413
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:38,600
Yeah, I know so like her that usually if you're above like 150

414
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,440
The bosses are harder. So that's why I'm at 130

415
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:53,240
I don't want to like I don't have a zers comment. I'm probably not again, you can't really use a zers

416
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,240
I could use a zers comment

417
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,440
on

418
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:59,720
Mogue because you just stand still but otherwise

419
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:06,600
Otherwise I probably wouldn't need to do that

420
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
You

421
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:15,480
What who said that I don't ever watch videos people said that

422
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,280
Am I dilulu

423
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:29,720
Hello, I don't have carrion slicer

424
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:35,880
I do love carrion slicer. I think they're wrong. They don't scale level. Okay

425
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,960
That's so weird. Why did people freaking say that then?

426
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:50,040
Big moon

427
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:53,480
Yeah, I can't do I already I already locked myself out of big moon though

428
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:00,120
Because I I use the runes too from um renala's remembrance

429
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:02,120
Oh

430
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:12,520
That's what it is unless it's new game plus and this is my first. Okay. That you're right

431
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,880
Thank you for pointing that out. You are so correct about that

432
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:22,440
Because that is what they said. That's what they meant. You're so right. I totally misunderstood

433
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:31,640
Yeah, I I know I can do better mausoleum. That's true. I didn't I didn't use mausoleums at all during my first ever run

434
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:37,000
Actually, I did but I never did anything about them like I would go to them, but I didn't do anything

435
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,440
The big bell turtles

436
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,820
Okay, you're right. You're right. I totally forgot about that too

437
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,600
I

438
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,680
Has been doing she's doing okay

439
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,200
Hmm

440
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,160
So you said you want me to lower what?

441
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:14,920
To ink put it into decks. I forget. Well, let me scroll up

442
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:19,480
Hey shebers. I like the new outfit. How's it going? I started outering and I've been playing it

443
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:26,360
So the past week and we're falling down the good fall down the rabbit hole lower into decks. Okay, so let's do

444
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,240
What like this

445
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:33,240
What are you thinking 30 55?

446
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:40,440
Yeah, yeah, no, I know I can respect but like what would be ideal for me to go into the dlc with you know

447
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:42,840
And I I got I value your guys's opinion

448
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,320
I feel like this looks good

449
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:53,080
Again, this 22 is bothering me. I wish it was 25

450
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,120
Um

451
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,120
But I'll survive

452
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:02,760
You should go without a weapon. Oh my god, you're so right queen

453
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,960
You going to dlc blind as I know

454
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:12,680
everything about the lore of the dlc, but I've never

455
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,000
and I know the

456
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,160
Boss fights, but I it's only some of them like all the remembrance bosses

457
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:24,520
I know about and only like I also fell asleep to a lot of the videos because I like to listen to them

458
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,320
um

459
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:29,880
Lots of faith up it's in dlc

460
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:33,960
I've heard but I also want to play like I've always been a faith builds and I know

461
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:39,080
Ironic with the way I'm dressed right now, but I really want to try the int builds

462
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:43,960
The lc is so easy. It's the easiest you'll see. Okay. I'm gonna go with this

463
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,160
I

464
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:53,160
Um, I'm actually gonna just try to get another

465
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,920
Okay, I don't have runes like I thought I did. Oh wait, do I?

466
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:10,120
I'm just gonna use all my little

467
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:13,240
Think about I'm gonna see if I can get like one more level

468
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:20,360
Wait talk do I not have what do I do? I don't have stuff equipped

469
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,880
Oh, I need a two-handed that's why

470
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,240
What is happening I forget how to play

471
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,800
Oh my god

472
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:49,320
I'm like, how do I shoot air? I haven't played in a week and I'm like, how do I play?

473
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:00,680
Okay, I'm gonna level actually

474
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,640
How many how much more do I need?

475
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:12,360
And okay, let me kill him one more time. Let me sit down

476
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:21,720
No, I don't really care about you. I only grab this so I could farm so I don't really care about using this

477
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,720
What is the serpent bow? I don't remember

478
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,400
Hey, oh

479
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:31,960
Come here little burb. Thank you. It's so sweet

480
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:39,480
Because I don't like to go in just anything like a fight with a lot of runes

481
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:42,280
Uh

482
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:56,360
It's my character's pants. What about it? Oh, what the heck? Why are my pants like that?

483
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:03,560
Why am I isn't my weight is it the weight? Why are they like that?

484
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:07,080
Why was I

485
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:11,960
Why was I not wearing any pants? I don't know what did she bet than you do

486
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:19,480
What what staff

487
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,160
Oh my god, level 282

488
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:31,640
I'm role-playing right now that I wouldn't have any pants at all

489
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:41,800
Lissat staff. Where is Lissa? Is that dlc when you guys recommend a weapon?

490
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:45,880
Please tell me if it's dlc or not because I don't know all the base game up weapons either

491
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,560
Okay, I was checking if I was gonna fat roll

492
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:09,560
Oh

493
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,280
I think somebody recommended that before

494
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,800
Let me just walk off the cliff

495
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:31,800
My cost more fp I'm not gonna bother with that. I'm I'd rather spend the time getting some sort of staff from the dlc

496
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:35,960
um, but yes, I have moon veil and I have

497
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,840
the meteorite staff

498
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:44,840
Then I do I already have Lissat staff because I just I went through the sorcery

499
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,200
town

500
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,200
Do I have that?

501
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:55,080
I don't know either the staff have lost is that what you meant

502
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:00,120
No, that's boost and visibility sorcery, which no one uses

503
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:04,120
I have to beat the boss for it. I didn't beat the there's a boss there

504
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:08,920
What

505
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:13,800
You mean in kaolin there is a

506
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:22,760
Wait a second. Wait a second. Wait a second. Wait a second. What why did I not notice that?

507
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:26,120
This one you mean selling a town of sorcery

508
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:28,120
What

509
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:37,240
What

510
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,560
Oh

511
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:46,440
Raina, are you puking? I feel like I just heard you spit up girl. Where's you at?

512
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:48,440
Oh

513
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:58,520
Let me check on that sound like someone was puking. Oh, I love cats. They just like puke everywhere

514
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,880
What are you doing?

515
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:09,320
What are you doing?

516
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:12,280
You puke? Oh, no you're chewing on a box

517
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:19,320
I

518
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:35,560
Got on cat TV for the keys

519
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,960
Raina loves cat TV

520
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:46,920
You're watching chipmunks

521
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,760
Ow

522
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:57,720
I am like, you know, like how you'll wake up

523
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,760
I mean sometimes almost just as you hear the first note of your alarm

524
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:05,560
If I hear the first note of Raina puking, I am wide awake

525
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:09,640
It was me who I threw up

526
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:13,480
All right. Yeah, let's let's go get that boss then. Why not?

527
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:16,280
Let's go get that boss. Why didn't you guys mention this before?

528
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:19,400
I'm surprised you guys didn't mention it when I was getting the night comet

529
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:32,680
Where where where where is it?

530
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:41,640
Oh, fuck

531
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:59,800
I don't I said I don't like back seating unless I ask for help and I'm clearly asking for help go left. Okay. Fuck off

532
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:05,880
Something tells me it's over here

533
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:12,440
Oh, yeah

534
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:26,120
Do do do how do I play? Oh god

535
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:36,360
Oh frick no Raina

536
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:49,080
You bitch you bitch I want that whip. Oh stop canceling me out

537
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:55,160
Oh my god, no

538
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,520
No, no

539
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,200
Oh

540
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:10,520
Whoa, why is her reach on that so far?

541
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:28,520
You bitch, maybe I should lock on maybe I should do that. Maybe that would be a good idea

542
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,240
Oh

543
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:36,200
Oh you whatever

544
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:50,360
What

545
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:58,700
Please stop running away Jesus that took way too many flasks

546
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:05,320
Uh

547
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:07,560
Give me that flowing sword

548
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:13,320
Wait, I thought you said there's a staff. Oh, I found it

549
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:23,400
Raina are you singing the song of your people?

550
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:31,640
What is the whip skill with

551
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:37,480
Because I want this would be very I was like tempted to do a cosplay run

552
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,400
Oh, I see

553
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:09,320
Okay, interesting that would be a good whip

554
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:21,960
You need to confess confess

555
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:27,160
Matter with the whip doesn't yeah, that's why I was trying to figure out

556
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:31,160
I'm trying to think of

557
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,400
Or maybe it's

558
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:36,200
I don't know

559
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,800
I don't freaking know

560
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,800
I don't like the noise that it makes

561
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:45,480
I'm a sucker for a sickle though. Although. It's not really a sickle. It's just a goofy looking sword if you really look at it

562
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:56,360
Oh, it's your first time here. Hello, welcome

563
00:57:57,080 --> 00:58:03,080
My name is she be cotton mom. I am a part of indulge gen one of velar

564
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:11,000
Um, I'm your favorite girl failure dom and I love to kind of dress up my model and role play and do wacky voices

565
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:13,400
And I have three cats and they all are very chatty

566
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:18,360
Um

567
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:23,880
I tried doing the light attack I didn't I didn't really do anything

568
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:31,560
I'm literally like

569
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:44,120
Oh, thank you, authority tight. Oh, maybe I should two hands. You're right. You're right. You're right

570
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:52,680
What the I am I stupid?

571
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:00,440
Thank you, authority for the gift it yippie

572
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:04,280
Again, I don't remember how to play either

573
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:09,880
Make sure you say thank you if you got something

574
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:17,240
Hi, Toma. Hi my sweet monkey

575
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:20,920
Everybody say hi to Toma

576
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:28,040
How much damage does this do I know I don't scale with it and it's not lovely at all, but I kind of want to see

577
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:39,960
Yeah, I definitely would put an ash of war on this bad boy. Hello, I need a guinea pig

578
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:45,080
I hear hello

579
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,800
Oh

580
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:53,640
Sorry, oh this does not do a lot. Ow. Ow. Ow

581
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:03,880
Oh, oh broke your stance though. Oh, uh, give me a moment. Give me a moment. Oh

582
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:12,200
Oh, this is I like the range on it though. Oh freaking stop

583
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:16,440
The animation is absolute trash though

584
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:21,320
Uh, I don't like that animation length

585
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:26,200
So I'm gonna go rest at the side of grace

586
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:33,080
Although I could have just gone to the other side of the grace, but you know, I don't think things sir

587
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:40,680
Does this not have a lot of ash of war and well, let me put an ash of war on it then I'm not going to use this

588
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:44,840
It has a very good hit, but I'd rather

589
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:48,520
um

590
01:00:53,400 --> 01:01:01,240
Well, what is this? No, it's I was like, what is this cop count as a curbsword? Oh my god my chummy

591
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:08,920
What's the difference between this and this

592
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:16,360
Is it called sorcery scaling? Okay

593
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:23,320
Hmm

594
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:27,160
Hmm. Hmm. All right

595
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:30,520
Sick. Does this have a special thing where it like boosts?

596
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:34,440
Oh, I was hoping I was hoping I had some sort of passive effect

597
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:37,640
Um read the item description

598
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:39,880
And

599
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:43,400
Oops

600
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:46,440
How do I do that? I forget

601
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:57,240
Can I slap a skill on it? I don't know

602
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:01,560
I am pressing square

603
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:10,360
Is it this button

604
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:14,040
No, no that's not it

605
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:19,160
Again, I'm using a PlayStation controller when I think you're supposed to be using like a uh

606
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:24,280
Watch them. I call it. Is it this? No

607
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:33,160
I'll never know guys

608
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:43,560
No, that just lets me equip it wait, why is it oops I didn't mean to do two steps

609
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:47,800
Oh my god, my tummy is hoarding

610
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:00,840
It's just me

611
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:05,640
Oh go through the inventory

612
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:18,280
How what the hell how do I why can't I see the item descriptions?

613
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:29,080
Oh, okay, it's square inventory. Okay. Yep. Yep. Yep

614
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:36,520
All right, hold on be right back my tummy horde

615
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:42,840
I'm dying my

616
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:05,160
Oh

617
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:36,120
You

618
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:05,160
You

619
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:35,160
You

620
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:05,160
You

621
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:35,160
You

622
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:05,160
You

623
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:35,160
You

624
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:05,160
You

625
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:35,160
You

626
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:05,160
You

627
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:35,160
You

628
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:05,160
You

629
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:35,160
You

630
01:10:57,960 --> 01:10:59,960
Okay, I'm done fighting for my life

631
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:04,680
I can't believe you guys let me eat ice cream

632
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:14,840
I realize I should have put up a BRB screen

633
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:21,240
I didn't do anything that was your idea

634
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:28,520
Yeah, I told them where they fed me ice cream against my will

635
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:37,080
Yeah, I fought tooth and nail guys the cult

636
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:41,160
Odd can I be like TMI real quick?

637
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:45,800
It was like

638
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:47,800
I thought I was like dying

639
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:52,120
Like my insides that were being like flushed out like I was just like

640
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:55,480
Turning to sludge from the inside

641
01:11:55,640 --> 01:12:00,840
But I realized as I was looking I was like it's from the red velvet cake

642
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:07,080
Raina come here

643
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:14,520
I also took a while because Raina decided because I was bent over like Shinji and Raina decided to sit on my back

644
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:17,320
And so I had to wait for her to get off

645
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:22,200
Yeah, it was it looked like scarlet rot

646
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:28,360
It's all your fault

647
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:35,480
So technically is your fault because it was the cake I was like

648
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:44,520
Oh

649
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:51,480
Really? Oh, that's a good idea. Toma. I didn't know that why would it turn? Oh because it probably like absorbs everything

650
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:56,360
Raina come stug

651
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:01,800
One of the Raina will probably lay on my lap rather than the cat cam

652
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:10,040
Anyways, let us commence

653
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:14,840
Hey, it could have been pro no you guys told me to do that too

654
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:20,040
You guys are bad influence on me. I'm just gonna say

655
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Just gonna say

656
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:27,240
Oh, yeah, no the ice cream is great

657
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:40,680
I'm scared to toot

658
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:43,400
You

659
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:51,800
Harlets are so mean I'm happy Toma understands

660
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:01,400
Yeah, for shame for shame

661
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:05,800
It's ridiculous. What do you guys even talk about when I was gone?

662
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:16,680
The one time I don't want to be sheepies cats

663
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:24,520
She doesn't come back I'm gonna fade away like I got Thanos snap

664
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:36,200
Oh that

665
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:42,680
Oh

666
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:55,720
Offending staff of loss will give you a Thursday at the end of the month. Uh, that'd probably be if I was going like full sorcery

667
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:03,240
Yeah, they weren't gonna survive. Yeah, you're

668
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:06,840
She is built to survive

669
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:09,800
Don't miss you the most

670
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:15,640
The fossil

671
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:20,920
I'm waiting for boomie to come back because when I got up he got up too

672
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:30,280
All right, what am I doing?

673
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:35,160
Was I resting here or something

674
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:38,840
I

675
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:41,080
Guys, no, I don't have anything

676
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:45,560
I I've literally been let me go to this. I've been speed running

677
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:48,840
Wait, why did I have this marked?

678
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:53,800
I don't remember uh, I've been speed running

679
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:56,680
Trying to get to the dlc. So I haven't

680
01:15:57,640 --> 01:15:59,480
like I'm not even

681
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:04,760
Gonna bother with like the consecrated snow fields and like the mount top of the giants

682
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:07,720
Um, however, I do have to go see

683
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:12,120

Yeah, we're gonna go beat a homeless man. Um, I

687
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:33,400
Should upgrade it. Is this an upgradeable weapon? Is the staff upgradeable?

688
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:38,200
I don't know if I have any I'm assuming it takes like

689
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:45,880
I hate I wish the round table would kind of just be floating the corner

690
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:50,680
The meteorite one is the only one you can't

691
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:53,880
No, yeah, no, you can't upgrade the meteorite one

692
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:57,720
Hugue

693
01:16:57,720 --> 01:16:59,320
Wrong way

694
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:01,320
Hugue

695
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:02,600
Wrong way

696
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:04,600
Hugue

697
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:07,080

01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:11,080
Finally hi

699
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:16,600
Uh, I don't have any ghost glove work

700
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:30,680
Under a rock I was

701
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
I

702
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:43,320
Do not have a three

703
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:45,960
Frick

704
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:58,440
Okay, let's go fight gold free

705
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:00,440
Okay

706
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:02,680
So I can get that

707
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:08,120
Watch them or call it. Uh, where is more god? No, not more god. I accidentally already got more god's shackle

708
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:10,440
Where is mogs shackle?

709
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:19,400
I feel like it it's over here, isn't it? I didn't get any of the sights of grace on the way

710
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:22,200
So I'm just gonna start

711
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:31,240
Yeah, all right

712
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,480
Oh, yeah, that's right because I have to kill his little ghost

713
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:43,400
Fuck I hate that. Why did I sit back down? I didn't mean to hello

714
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:50,600
Uh, we all know that I can't do direction

715
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:01,160
Oh

716
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:04,920
I don't have to kill his I thought his ghost was in the sewers and I have to kill it together

717
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:08,680
I don't forget remember I when I killed mogu before I just killed him

718
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:14,600
And when I say I killed him I had summoned some other players and they is their comet his ass

719
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:16,600
So

720
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
I can't remember where stuff is

721
01:19:36,280 --> 01:19:40,120
To kill mogu you just need to kill the one a mogu in palace what really

722
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:44,840
How detailed instructors do you want? Um

723
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:53,080
Wait, why is that two then what's one? What did I set as one?

724
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:58,360
What the heck what was I setting up over here?

725
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:00,440
Oh

726
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:11,560
I like need to remove these because they're gonna bother me. Oh there it is. It's because I was doing that

727
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:16,520
Where's the three is in that direction?

728
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:27,080

729
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:31,320

01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:37,560

01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:07,320

Or it's the guy on the horse

746
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:28,200

Has booby done anything in the stream actually he's been pretty good. It's been all right

He's

770
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:45,720
It's cuz he wants to face this direction. He doesn't want to face the other direction. So you get boomi, but I'm sorry

771
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:49,480

Why are you still following me? Where are you? Okay left

788
01:27:41,160 --> 01:27:43,160
Go away

789
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:48,920
Put these foolish ambitions to rest

790
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:51,560
Is he

791
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:54,920
Is he

792
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:56,920
He's chasing after me

793
01:27:57,160 --> 01:28:03,000
How do they just like send themselves like how do they do that? Is there where's this freaking grace?

794
01:28:03,640 --> 01:28:08,280
I'm going the wrong way. Anyways, it's over here right there. I'm so dumb

795
01:28:10,680 --> 01:28:12,680
He's still following me

796
01:28:14,120 --> 01:28:16,120
I think he disappeared

797
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:28,280
Yeah, how do they how's their how are their astral projection projecting

798
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:34,680
How do they astral project with health

799
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:47,880
I'm just breaking everything wait, I thought it's yeah in that direction

800
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:52,920
Again, I haven't played Elden Ring in about like

801
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
Since it came out

802
01:28:57,560 --> 01:28:59,560
So I don't remember everything is

803
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:15,480
I like forget like all the late game stuff for some reason

804
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:28,040
Wait, I feel like something is shot at me. What is it? I forget. Oh, that's what it is. It's this freaking dude. I thought

805
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:33,560
Where is it?

806
01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:39,880
Oh, it's that bridge over there. All right

807
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:49,480
Isn't there a death bird? I can't recall where the death bird is

808
01:29:52,280 --> 01:29:54,520
Pretty sure there's a death bird like right over here

809
01:29:56,120 --> 01:29:58,120
If I remember correctly

810
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:03,240
Excuse him. Oh my god. Well, that's awkward. No

811
01:30:05,560 --> 01:30:07,560
There's so many freaking giants

812
01:30:11,080 --> 01:30:15,320
Oh, I didn't think that would hit me. This is not worth it. Maybe

813
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:17,480
I

814
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:24,200
No, I was hoping it wouldn't hit me

815
01:30:27,080 --> 01:30:30,440
I'm right next to you. I'm right here

816
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:38,840
Am I gonna lock on and no

817
01:30:46,120 --> 01:30:48,120
Killing you in particular

818
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:52,200
Why did he jump up like that?

819
01:31:05,640 --> 01:31:12,520
Keep running run. Oh frick. Oh frick. I forgot about you. I forgot about the da

820
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:19,480
Wait, I didn't equip my staff for some reason

821
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:24,840
What why isn't it showing up?

822
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:28,840
Hello, oh

823
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:37,320
Uh question mark. I am confused. All righty then. Um, I'm stuck in the street

824
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:44,600
Okay

825
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:48,440
Why why am I even trying?

826
01:31:55,240 --> 01:32:02,360
It's funny when I first did my own playthrough. I um, just cheat. I felt like I cheesed every boss with um

827
01:32:08,120 --> 01:32:12,440
You gotta have a copyface key. Uh, yes, I know I need to kill him to get past the door

828
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:17,160
Um, I just like use the black knife on everybody and I just maxed it out

829
01:32:18,040 --> 01:32:20,680
And it was very effective because it was effective against most

830
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:23,320
So it's like god's good apostles and shit

831
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:29,880
Why isn't it letting me use the staff

832
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:34,120
Am I missing something

833
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:36,840
Why I was literally clicking this

834
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:40,360
And it didn't do it. You guys saw it like

835
01:32:41,160 --> 01:32:44,040
Do it. I'm not I'm not going crazy

836
01:32:46,920 --> 01:32:55,240
Oh, I should have I didn't equip that that's fine. Uh, I don't even know this is effective against you

837
01:32:58,680 --> 01:33:00,680
Nope, it's not

838
01:33:10,360 --> 01:33:12,360
So

839
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:25,880
Damn

840
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:29,800
Nope

841
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:42,520
So

842
01:33:45,320 --> 01:33:47,320
What three times

843
01:33:53,880 --> 01:33:55,880
Whoa, I pressed B

844
01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:16,200
No, I thought I could time that right. Okay, I can get him. I'm not gonna summon

845
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:24,840
Why would I summon I can beat him myself. I don't need to summon

846
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:37,240
You think I should use the meteorite stuff I'll try it

847
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:39,240
I

848
01:34:40,120 --> 01:34:42,120
Got Zigglin some stuff

849
01:34:45,320 --> 01:34:47,320
Let me just

850
01:34:51,160 --> 01:34:53,160
Does he see me

851
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:56,680
Damn it

852
01:35:07,240 --> 01:35:09,240
I

853
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:16,920
Damn it, I was hoping I could creep up behind him

854
01:35:22,360 --> 01:35:26,360
What are you doing? Oh, I'm not paying attention

855
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:31,900
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm like not paying attention

856
01:35:38,120 --> 01:35:43,960
That's not you lied. I'd rather use the meteorite staff. I mean the moon veil

857
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:55,800
What how did he that's weird you guys saw me roll out of that

858
01:35:58,120 --> 01:36:02,120
Oh, I rolled into that it's fine. Let me pick up my rooms

859
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Can you stop

860
01:36:06,280 --> 01:36:11,400
Why am I getting I'm I'm doing it at the right time. I'm I'm doing things at the right time

861
01:36:11,400 --> 01:36:13,400
I maybe I should be jumping instead of rolling

862
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:20,440
This I can just kind of really step out of the way of

863
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:34,120
You

864
01:36:41,160 --> 01:36:44,440
Are you gonna go fourth time? Yeah, you already fucking bitch

865
01:36:46,440 --> 01:36:48,440
Oh, you fucking bitch

866
01:36:49,160 --> 01:36:51,160
Why did you do it five times?

867
01:36:52,680 --> 01:36:54,680
Stop with the horse

868
01:36:55,640 --> 01:36:57,640
I don't

869
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:00,520
Oh my god

870
01:37:02,120 --> 01:37:10,680
I'm sick of your horse. I'm sick of your horse

871
01:37:17,480 --> 01:37:19,480
I'm out of fp

872
01:37:29,240 --> 01:37:31,240
Oh

873
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:34,840
Oh

874
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:38,520
No

875
01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:46,520
Bro, let me live

876
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:53,800
Oh

877
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:56,600
Oh

878
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:02,840
Wait, did I swear

879
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:14,600
No, why would I use it I'm not gonna use the spirit summons. No, no, no, no, no, no, no

880
01:38:17,480 --> 01:38:19,480
A little bit damn

881
01:38:23,880 --> 01:38:27,320
I'm say so I'm say so I'm say so I'm say so I'm say so

882
01:38:35,560 --> 01:38:44,280
I wish I was near a side of grace, but to change to something else wait, can I uh, do you like a magic limp blade moment?

883
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:48,520
I'm too far away

884
01:38:54,040 --> 01:39:00,360
How much damage will that do to you? Oh, okay

885
01:39:00,360 --> 01:39:02,360
Oh

886
01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:24,760
Oh too early

887
01:39:27,080 --> 01:39:29,080
Oh fuck you

888
01:39:30,680 --> 01:39:32,680
Oh

889
01:39:46,680 --> 01:39:51,400
Have you found me scato trees bros bro, I'm literally still in the base game. What are you talking about?

890
01:39:52,200 --> 01:40:01,160
No cost spell spam, yeah

891
01:40:04,840 --> 01:40:06,840
Let's try it. Let's try it. Let's try it

892
01:40:21,640 --> 01:40:26,520
Oh shit, that actually was helpful

893
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:28,520
Oh

894
01:40:50,680 --> 01:40:52,680
How did that miss

895
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:54,680
Oh

896
01:41:08,680 --> 01:41:13,240
Yeah, I jumped too early. Oh, it's enough with the fucking horse

897
01:41:18,680 --> 01:41:20,840
I thought the animation wouldn't take that long

898
01:41:22,680 --> 01:41:24,680
I

899
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:44,600
Damn it

900
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:46,840
Oh

901
01:41:56,440 --> 01:42:00,760
Oh, you stupid horse, that's gonna kill me. This is gonna kill me. Yeah

902
01:42:07,480 --> 01:42:11,080
Yeah, these are in the in my opinion, these are easier than a tree sentinel

903
01:42:15,160 --> 01:42:17,560
I think they have dragon powers because of the red lightning

904
01:42:19,480 --> 01:42:21,480
Yeah, it's a draconic sentinel

905
01:42:25,080 --> 01:42:30,040
Uh, let's try that again. I like that this opening with the spam because it kind of staggers him

906
01:42:41,240 --> 01:42:43,240
No

907
01:42:45,320 --> 01:42:52,520
Oh fucking mother, I mean praise the lord

908
01:42:54,680 --> 01:42:56,680
No, I didn't mean to cast

909
01:43:00,440 --> 01:43:04,920
I'm so close to death. I'm so close to death. Please enough with the horse

910
01:43:06,360 --> 01:43:10,600
Oh, I was like hoping oh, please stop

911
01:43:10,600 --> 01:43:12,600
Stop

912
01:43:12,920 --> 01:43:14,920
Please stop

913
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:18,760
Oh my god

914
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:29,400
Why do I feel like me taking drinking is taking longer than usual. Oh my god

915
01:43:35,720 --> 01:43:37,720
What

916
01:43:38,680 --> 01:43:40,680
Yeah, the horse is like the spam

917
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:49,480
He will usually spam if you're well, I noticed that that was that much was obvious. I knew when I got a certain distance

918
01:43:49,480 --> 01:43:51,480
He spams it

919
01:43:59,560 --> 01:44:03,480
Boomi you are so cute right now. I wish you guys could see his face. Uh, what if I

920
01:44:04,440 --> 01:44:06,920
I want to creep I want to creep up on him

921
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:17,080
I thought that was a grace. I got really excited. I was like, there's not a grace this close

922
01:44:33,480 --> 01:44:35,480
So

923
01:45:03,480 --> 01:45:05,480
Oh

924
01:45:17,400 --> 01:45:19,400
Come on

925
01:45:22,520 --> 01:45:24,440
The plastic bag did you a number on him

926
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
It's might take me a while

927
01:45:30,040 --> 01:45:32,920
Damn, that was good. Yeah, that was good damage. That was good damage

928
01:45:33,640 --> 01:45:35,640
Uh, you can't

929
01:45:37,640 --> 01:45:43,960
Repost him. Can you though? You can't repost the draconic sentinel

930
01:45:46,280 --> 01:45:48,280
Right, I can't recall

931
01:45:52,920 --> 01:45:59,720
Okay, you're right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So because I I literally ran to the front when I could have been spamming like to get blood built

932
01:45:59,800 --> 01:46:02,680
Uh, uh, fuck. I'm not here. I'm not here

933
01:46:04,440 --> 01:46:06,440
Well, I might lock down these fucking birds

934
01:46:07,480 --> 01:46:12,760
I'm not here. I'm not here. I'm not here. I don't see shit. You don't see shit, bitch. You don't see shit. You don't see shit

935
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:15,400
I'm not here

936
01:46:18,200 --> 01:46:20,200
I'm just a creepin

937
01:46:21,720 --> 01:46:23,720
Creeping by you

938
01:46:24,600 --> 01:46:26,600
Sneaking

939
01:46:26,920 --> 01:46:28,920
Sneaking by you

940
01:46:33,480 --> 01:46:35,480
I

941
01:46:56,120 --> 01:46:58,120
I'm trying to roll backwards

942
01:46:58,920 --> 01:47:02,600
And for some odd reason I'm just like getting locked in the animation

943
01:47:04,120 --> 01:47:06,120
Oh

944
01:47:06,440 --> 01:47:08,440
The tweet fine, I'll tweet

945
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
My eye is twitching

946
01:47:16,840 --> 01:47:18,840
Oh

947
01:47:19,400 --> 01:47:21,400

Oh, I'm letting you like of me. I'll never recover

950
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:39,800
All right

951
01:47:46,280 --> 01:47:48,280
Ending it all in Aldenry

952
01:47:48,280 --> 01:47:50,280
Um

953
01:48:07,160 --> 01:48:09,160
Nope, that's not what I meant to look at

954
01:48:18,680 --> 01:48:22,600
I know epi boomy. He's all curled up in a little like

955
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:26,840
His eyes are open actually

956
01:48:29,800 --> 01:48:31,800
There you go

957
01:48:39,080 --> 01:48:41,080
No, no, go back to sleep

958
01:48:49,160 --> 01:48:51,160
Go back to sleep

959
01:48:54,280 --> 01:48:56,280
Go back to sleep

960
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
Go back to sleep

961
01:49:17,240 --> 01:49:20,280
Bro, who are you looking at? He's looking at nothing. He's he's even

962
01:49:22,680 --> 01:49:24,680
Half and me had a rat cam that'd be funny

963
01:49:26,920 --> 01:49:30,040
Yeah, I used to have a pat cam a lot um in my pl

964
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:35,800
And um

965
01:49:37,720 --> 01:49:43,160
I realized a lot of people really liked it. So I wanted to bring it back once I felt more comfortable with y'all

966
01:49:56,280 --> 01:49:58,280
What

967
01:50:08,760 --> 01:50:10,760
Oh

968
01:50:17,320 --> 01:50:20,280
No, I keep flummoxing it

969
01:50:22,520 --> 01:50:25,720
They move around too much understandable boomy's kind of just chilling right now

970
01:50:26,360 --> 01:50:28,360
Oh

971
01:50:29,880 --> 01:50:31,880
Okay, he

972
01:50:33,240 --> 01:50:37,320
Is a gentleman and he bows the draconics tree sentinel

973
01:50:39,080 --> 01:50:41,080
Oh, oh

974
01:50:53,160 --> 01:50:55,160
Oh my

975
01:50:56,600 --> 01:51:00,840
Hey, you you didn't hear but he made a little squeak when he stretched he was like

976
01:51:05,400 --> 01:51:09,720
That's because he's cute doesn't mean he's a menace. Don't be fooled. Don't be fooled your honor

977
01:51:17,240 --> 01:51:24,360
He is not who he says he is you honor didn't many a serial killer lure in unsuspecting victims

978
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
Let's just sit and look at him for a moment

979
01:51:33,160 --> 01:51:36,920
So I can like spam a few things right off the rip like

980
01:51:44,600 --> 01:51:46,600
Yeah, okay

981
01:51:50,680 --> 01:51:53,320
Okay, nope I I did it too early

982
01:51:53,720 --> 01:51:55,720
No

983
01:52:00,360 --> 01:52:04,600
I did it too early and why am I getting the timing wrong? Why am I getting the timing wrong?

984
01:52:11,880 --> 01:52:13,880
Hey, can't you just walk past him? No

985
01:52:18,440 --> 01:52:21,640
If you think I would have walked past him do you think I would have walked past him

986
01:52:22,120 --> 01:52:24,440
Don't you think I'm fighting this boss for a reason?

987
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,880
Don't cry talk it up

988
01:52:37,080 --> 01:52:41,580
Maybe glit blit oh when he staggered that's a good idea. That's a good idea

989
01:52:52,600 --> 01:52:56,440
Since I can't reposs this motherfucker, which is ridiculous

990
01:53:13,240 --> 01:53:15,240
Oh, why did I do that?

991
01:53:22,600 --> 01:53:24,600
Oh

01:53:37,080 --> 01:53:39,080

996
01:54:08,120 --> 01:54:10,120
I can't get my fp

997
01:54:15,480 --> 01:54:17,480

01:54:37,880 --> 01:54:41,800
Dang that was good though. That was good. That was good

1001
01:54:44,680 --> 01:54:47,880
He's not a hard boss. He's not a hard boss. He really isn't

1002
01:54:51,880 --> 01:54:53,880
I

1003
01:54:59,400 --> 01:55:01,400
Boomi is snug as a bug in a rug

1004
01:55:16,680 --> 01:55:21,160
Usually like I killed him in like five seconds because again I had the black knife

1005
01:55:22,120 --> 01:55:24,120
When I got him before so

1006
01:55:35,720 --> 01:55:38,220
Oh, why didn't I how

1007
01:55:52,360 --> 01:55:59,240
I'm so close to you. Why are you spamming that? Why am I only just sheathing why?

1008
01:56:04,600 --> 01:56:08,360
Since when was the aoe so a frickin large

1009
01:56:21,800 --> 01:56:23,800

Why you he's leaning so much

1015
01:57:16,840 --> 01:57:19,340
Bro you're gonna fall off my desk

1016
01:57:22,200 --> 01:57:25,800
He can be a little darling indeed. I didn't mean to do that

1017
01:57:30,120 --> 01:57:32,360
I am going to beat them without ashes

1018
01:57:35,720 --> 01:57:39,080
I am going to I am gonna be him without summoning

1019
01:57:46,520 --> 01:57:49,000
I kind of want to level my moon veil some more

1020
01:57:52,360 --> 01:57:56,280
I almost I'm debating whether or not to max it out, but I don't know if even that's

1021
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:00,680
Point wow look at the freaking colors and the lighting

1022
01:58:21,640 --> 01:58:23,640
No

1023
01:58:51,640 --> 01:58:53,640
I'm out of a pee

1024
01:59:07,800 --> 01:59:09,800
How did he hit me from the far

1025
01:59:18,920 --> 01:59:20,920
Are you stuck

1026
01:59:21,640 --> 01:59:23,640
I

1027
01:59:33,960 --> 01:59:38,440
Eat my booty eat it eat it eat it

1028
01:59:44,040 --> 01:59:46,040
Nice

1029
01:59:46,040 --> 01:59:48,040
I

1030
01:59:48,280 --> 01:59:51,480
Just had to lock in just had to lock in boys just had to lock in

1031
01:59:52,760 --> 01:59:57,240
Uh, I swear to god. I thought a side of grace was right here, but I suppose not

1032
02:00:00,760 --> 02:00:02,760
I was right here

1033
02:00:04,920 --> 02:00:07,800
How many tries did I take like eight eight attempts ten?

1034
02:00:10,600 --> 02:00:12,600
You're to confess your sins

1035
02:00:13,080 --> 02:00:15,080
Welcome

1036
02:00:23,080 --> 02:00:26,360
Okay, I should probably sit down me let me pop a squat

1037
02:00:30,200 --> 02:00:32,200
Pop a squat and confess

1038
02:00:39,320 --> 02:00:41,320
All right, now we got a fight

1039
02:00:42,920 --> 02:00:44,920
And what's his face

1040
02:00:46,920 --> 02:00:48,920
Can upgrade your flask. Oh, you're right

1041
02:00:51,320 --> 02:00:53,320
Let me go do that

1042
02:01:01,480 --> 02:01:03,480
Sometimes I forget things

1043
02:01:08,520 --> 02:01:10,520
I'm speaking of witch

1044
02:01:13,480 --> 02:01:15,480
Uh

1045
02:01:20,440 --> 02:01:23,320
Yeah, because I have comet and I have night comet

1046
02:01:30,760 --> 02:01:36,200
Because night comet is good with the staff a loss because it's semi invisible and it boosts like invisibility stuff

1047
02:01:36,440 --> 02:01:38,440
I

1048
02:01:42,520 --> 02:01:44,520
Start from the beginning

1049
02:01:45,320 --> 02:01:48,920
Yeah, that's me. You're probably wondering how I got so sinful

1050
02:01:50,040 --> 02:01:52,040
Huh, I bet you thought I was gonna run off, huh?

1051
02:01:54,120 --> 02:01:56,120
You're wrong

1052
02:01:57,720 --> 02:02:01,560
Hello, oh, I'm like that was taken a bit

1053
02:02:06,920 --> 02:02:08,920
I

1054
02:02:11,320 --> 02:02:17,240
Da da da da gonna go fight what's his face Godfrey

1055
02:02:24,520 --> 02:02:26,520
Moink

1056
02:02:31,800 --> 02:02:33,800
Hello

1057
02:02:34,760 --> 02:02:36,760
Hello

1058
02:02:38,120 --> 02:02:40,120
Oh no

1059
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:45,320
Clary no the condensation clary

1060
02:02:49,640 --> 02:02:51,640
I feel like something's gonna jump out at me

1061
02:02:54,920 --> 02:02:56,920
Wait, did I go the wrong way?

1062
02:02:59,320 --> 02:03:03,240
Wait, what the heck this is this is normal lindel

1063
02:03:04,120 --> 02:03:06,120
I

1064
02:03:09,080 --> 02:03:14,760
Went the right way took to Godfrey again, I don't remember

1065
02:03:18,520 --> 02:03:24,280
I couldn't I thought he was right after that like directly after but I am incorrect

1066
02:03:25,080 --> 02:03:29,560
Um, I know I can oh, yeah, there's a summoning pool right there

1067
02:03:30,040 --> 02:03:32,040
Uh

1068
02:03:32,360 --> 02:03:38,200
Did you have royal capital? I'm just gonna speed run past these little bubble dudes

1069
02:03:56,680 --> 02:03:58,680
Now

1070
02:04:00,040 --> 02:04:02,040
Let me just

1071
02:04:07,800 --> 02:04:13,880
No, no, I don't need to kill Godfrey not God. I know his ghost. Where is Godfrey's ghost?

1072
02:04:21,480 --> 02:04:26,040
Same way I could have sworn his ghost was closer

1073
02:04:30,280 --> 02:04:36,440
God damn it. All right, I'm gonna fuck with the other fucker

1074
02:04:39,960 --> 02:04:44,600
Yeah, he's amazing piercing boys shit

1075
02:04:51,800 --> 02:04:53,800
Oh, no

1076
02:04:54,680 --> 02:05:00,920
Moke shackle no, I want the talisman pouch and well and I'm getting moke shackle. So I think

1077
02:05:02,440 --> 02:05:04,440
I didn't get to the urtary sanctuary

1078
02:05:06,040 --> 02:05:08,040
Oh

1079
02:05:14,520 --> 02:05:16,520
Oh, I fucking hate the lindel knights

1080
02:05:24,120 --> 02:05:26,620
Okay, which is closer the shackle

1081
02:05:29,640 --> 02:05:31,640
Or Godfrey's ghost

1082
02:05:38,520 --> 02:05:40,600
Oh my back cracked, I don't know if you guys heard that

1083
02:05:50,440 --> 02:05:52,440
About the same distance

1084
02:05:53,800 --> 02:05:55,800
Yeah, that's why I was gonna get morgot too

1085
02:05:57,480 --> 02:06:00,040
So do I just literally just have to clear lindel

1086
02:06:04,920 --> 02:06:06,840
I do like lindel it is one of my favorite areas

1087
02:06:08,280 --> 02:06:12,120
Although I do distinctly remember crying because I kept dying to this one night

1088
02:06:14,600 --> 02:06:17,800
Okay, well, I guess we'll just speed run through this then

1089
02:06:19,320 --> 02:06:21,320
I do want to kill you though

1090
02:06:21,400 --> 02:06:23,400
No, don't throw shit at me

1091
02:06:23,800 --> 02:06:25,800
Oh

1092
02:06:38,120 --> 02:06:40,120
Thing is I can't remember where anything is

1093
02:06:44,520 --> 02:06:49,080
Because I should have just I shouldn't even gone through this way I should have gone through the city

1094
02:06:49,080 --> 02:06:51,080
I

1095
02:06:52,680 --> 02:07:00,440
Should have gone by the rooftops. Are you gonna chase me? Oh, I missed. Are you gonna kill me? Yeah

1096
02:07:05,400 --> 02:07:12,200
Well, I'm gonna go get my thing of ops, I will go get my

02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000

It's behind the two shrimps the scrimps

1099
02:07:35,320 --> 02:07:37,320
Your song sucks

1100
02:07:49,080 --> 02:07:51,080
Oh

1101
02:08:01,720 --> 02:08:04,120
What the frick I'm so stupid

1102
02:08:05,800 --> 02:08:07,800

02:08:12,520 --> 02:08:15,160
Anyways, we're fine

1104
02:08:15,960 --> 02:08:25,080
Hello, hello, hello, excuse me, uh, uh, pardon, excuse

1105
02:08:28,760 --> 02:08:33,400
Huh, why didn't she fall from fall damage? You know why didn't she die from fall damage?

1106
02:08:41,160 --> 02:08:43,160
Yeah, I kept dying to this dude right here

1107
02:08:45,400 --> 02:08:50,360
Because I I went from the rooftop I went from the rooftops to get over here

1108
02:08:53,080 --> 02:08:55,080
Uh, oh my god, he's gonna chase me

1109
02:08:57,560 --> 02:08:59,560
Stop

1110
02:09:01,800 --> 02:09:03,800
Go away

1111
02:09:05,640 --> 02:09:07,640
Go away

1112
02:09:09,240 --> 02:09:12,840
Stranger danger, why are you walking towards me?

1113
02:09:15,880 --> 02:09:21,800
I really don't want to fuck with you right now. I'm waiting for you to de-aggro so I can try to get the side of grace that's nearby

1114
02:09:23,720 --> 02:09:25,720
Oh my god, you're not going to

1115
02:09:31,480 --> 02:09:33,480
Maybe if I go all the way over here

1116
02:09:36,760 --> 02:09:39,080
Are you preaching me? Yeah, I do have enough

1117
02:09:39,960 --> 02:09:46,520
I don't need to go over here. Do I know this is where the sewers are I think um, but why are you still?

1118
02:09:49,080 --> 02:09:54,920
Bruh, how are you not de-agroed yet? Okay now you are I'm gonna let you walk away

1119
02:09:57,640 --> 02:10:00,680
His shoes whack his hair whack

1120
02:10:01,880 --> 02:10:06,120
His fit whack actually I remember I did farm that armor set before

1121
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
Where the frick did he go? Oh, he's right there

1122
02:10:11,080 --> 02:10:14,840
There is a side of grace on this side somewhere

1123
02:10:16,360 --> 02:10:18,360
And then there is the ur-tree

1124
02:10:19,160 --> 02:10:23,000
Uh, no, there's a dude in that place

1125
02:10:23,720 --> 02:10:25,720
I remember getting his weapon

1126
02:10:27,960 --> 02:10:29,960
Right

1127
02:10:30,520 --> 02:10:34,840
Yeah, that's the another crucible knight, I think

1128
02:10:39,480 --> 02:10:44,680
Yeah, yeah, he doesn't have a good shield. I never did it like a shield sword build though. Uh, let's see

1129
02:10:45,960 --> 02:10:50,760
Ur-tree should fall from the sky when I come over here. I presume

1130
02:10:52,280 --> 02:10:55,000
Where even eat is it jumping from?

1131
02:10:55,960 --> 02:11:02,600
Is it just spawn out of nowhere? We're we're like

1132
02:11:08,120 --> 02:11:12,360
Where is it waiting? Oh, see, yeah

1133
02:11:16,520 --> 02:11:18,520
That's the sewers down there

1134
02:11:25,960 --> 02:11:27,960
Excuse me

1135
02:11:33,480 --> 02:11:38,920
Okay, here we go. Perfect. Don't you fucking do it

1136
02:11:41,880 --> 02:11:44,440
I am busy go go reset

1137
02:11:48,840 --> 02:11:50,840
What what are you doing here?

1138
02:11:51,400 --> 02:11:55,560
Now I can set it on fire

1139
02:11:58,680 --> 02:12:00,680
I was really never your maiden

1140
02:12:03,320 --> 02:12:05,960
I offered you an accord and I'm taking it away

1141
02:12:09,240 --> 02:12:13,160
We all know who you really are Glomide Queen

1142
02:12:14,120 --> 02:12:16,120

I am gonna kill this just because it's actually let me go use my room

1166
02:14:30,200 --> 02:14:32,440
So I don't have to keep worrying about grabbing them

1167
02:14:41,800 --> 02:14:47,240
Oh, I'm not going to use that well actually I am gonna use that

1168
02:14:47,640 --> 02:14:49,640

So, you know what we're making that 25 eventually eventually we'll get to 25 for endurance

1172
02:15:17,240 --> 02:15:19,240
I

02:15:24,520 --> 02:15:31,080
Because it's also bothering me as well. All right, uh, what do I have here for you?

Okay

1177
02:15:59,400 --> 02:16:02,040
Okay, these really don't bother you that much

1178
02:16:08,440 --> 02:16:10,440
Let me just whoop-a

1179
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:13,000
I

What the frick I was I didn't press my forward stick fast enough, uh

1181

Oh, wait every good I can use my flask. Oh my god. I'm so silly

1186
02:16:41,320 --> 02:16:43,320
Oh

1187
02:16:49,160 --> 02:16:51,160
I did not get the timing right

1188
02:16:53,080 --> 02:16:57,400
I'm so stupid. I'm not paying attention to the timing. I was so focused on

1189
02:16:58,120 --> 02:17:01,800
When he was gonna swing that I forgot that it goes earlier for the little

1190
02:17:02,680 --> 02:17:05,160
Beams of light. I'm just standing there just like

Is that gonna reach him? Oh it did

02:21:16,360 --> 02:21:18,360
Uh, what did I just do

1227
02:21:19,320 --> 02:21:22,760
I accidentally made everything too big guys

1228
02:21:25,320 --> 02:21:30,440
Guys what did I just do? No, I didn't mean to take a screenshot. What did I just do?

Oh no

1230
02:21:37,560 --> 02:21:39,560
What did I just do

1231
02:21:41,720 --> 02:21:45,960
Guys I made everything so big I can't even see the game. It's just a two black screens

1232
02:21:46,840 --> 02:21:48,840
And I can kind of see

1233
02:21:50,600 --> 02:21:52,600
I can kind of see the chat

1234
02:21:55,080 --> 02:21:57,080
And then we'll let me get out of it

1235
02:21:59,720 --> 02:22:01,720
Um

1236
02:22:01,720 --> 02:22:03,720
Oh

1237
02:22:04,360 --> 02:22:06,360
Is there like a zoom thing

1238
02:22:11,320 --> 02:22:14,440
Is there a zoom feature because I think I accidentally turned that on

1239
02:22:16,200 --> 02:22:18,200
I

1240
02:22:19,800 --> 02:22:25,640
Because I can't see anything it's just switching across my stream guys help

1241
02:22:27,240 --> 02:22:33,640
I can't see anything I might take a picture and show you what my my screen looks like right now

1242
02:22:37,160 --> 02:22:39,160
I can see just the chat

1243
02:22:39,640 --> 02:22:41,640
I

1244
02:22:44,520 --> 02:22:46,520
Oh, you're right. I did hold on

1245
02:22:59,320 --> 02:23:01,320
What the hell

1246
02:23:09,480 --> 02:23:11,480
Oh

1247
02:23:14,520 --> 02:23:18,040
My god, I'm like in full screen and I can't get out of it

1248
02:23:19,160 --> 02:23:21,720
Guys, where did you go? No, I can't see the chat

1249
02:23:23,080 --> 02:23:25,080
Guys

1250
02:23:26,920 --> 02:23:31,560
Oh no, I don't know how to get out of this

1251
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:35,000
What did I press?

1252
02:23:35,320 --> 02:23:37,320
What did I press?

1253
02:23:38,040 --> 02:23:40,040
Do it again

1254
02:23:51,480 --> 02:23:55,480
How now I can only see my model in a black screen

1255
02:23:57,880 --> 02:23:59,880
No, I'm taking screenshots on accident

1256
02:24:00,200 --> 02:24:02,200

Okay, well I have to google this I can't have to google this for my phone

Super zoomed in windows

A magnifier tool the window and escape keys

It's my slipper

1273
02:26:01,320 --> 02:26:06,040
Stop trying to tag my slipper. Why are you sniffing where I put it?

1274
02:26:20,680 --> 02:26:22,680
I never had these before

1275
02:26:40,600 --> 02:26:42,600
There's girls with their gummies

1276
02:26:49,720 --> 02:26:51,720

02:26:51,800 --> 02:26:54,680
I couldn't find so my favorite gummies are this the um

There's no more left of the yellow

1285
02:27:43,480 --> 02:27:45,480
Movie's like no

02:27:46,120 --> 02:27:55,000
There's one left. No, I don't see a little one. What are you talking about? That's orange. That's orange

1287
02:28:00,680 --> 02:28:03,180
There's only purple green and red

1288
02:28:04,140 --> 02:28:06,140
Hmm

1289
02:28:14,460 --> 02:28:16,460
Whoa

1290
02:28:18,700 --> 02:28:20,700
That's not yellow it's orange

1291
02:28:34,140 --> 02:28:36,140
I just remembered I didn't kill him

1292
02:28:36,140 --> 02:28:38,140
Oh

1293
02:29:01,180 --> 02:29:03,180
Oh

1294
02:29:06,300 --> 02:29:08,300
Oh

1295
02:29:12,380 --> 02:29:14,380
What that was not

1296
02:29:19,660 --> 02:29:21,660
I'm stuck

1297
02:29:33,420 --> 02:29:35,420
I'm stuck. I'm definitely stuck now

1298
02:29:37,100 --> 02:29:42,300
Uh, I can't get out of here. Oh no, I can I jumped

1299
02:29:45,500 --> 02:29:47,500
I need to heal fast

1300
02:29:49,740 --> 02:29:51,740
Oh, I jumped too early

1301
02:29:52,380 --> 02:29:54,380
Okay

1302
02:29:55,180 --> 02:29:59,260
No, I just stick my hand in I eat what there's what's there. I don't pick colors

1303
02:30:00,300 --> 02:30:02,300
I'm not that type of autism

1304
02:30:03,340 --> 02:30:05,340
Not even autistic

1305
02:30:06,780 --> 02:30:08,780
So

1306
02:30:09,500 --> 02:30:16,540
It's a grape lemon green apple strawberry and orange honestly again, just like regular skittles. They all taste the same

1307
02:30:30,460 --> 02:30:32,460
Are you sure about that

1308
02:30:36,380 --> 02:30:38,380
Ah

1309
02:30:51,740 --> 02:30:56,940
How many times the animation is delayed I thought I was out of that

1310
02:30:59,500 --> 02:31:01,500
Okay, okay

1311
02:31:02,060 --> 02:31:07,020
Uh, I didn't mean to do that

1312
02:31:10,460 --> 02:31:13,260
Are you gonna jump nope

1313
02:31:17,500 --> 02:31:19,500
I'm not

1314
02:31:22,220 --> 02:31:26,700
Why does that kill me usually I'm really good at dodging that when I killed uh when I fought the urge tree

1315
02:31:27,580 --> 02:31:29,580
dude, um

1316
02:31:32,460 --> 02:31:35,980
Before I was able to dodge it a lot easier

1317
02:31:39,980 --> 02:31:41,980
Some kind of sting

1318
02:31:43,980 --> 02:31:47,260
Yeah, I do like holy magic. That's why I had the halo scythe

1319
02:31:51,180 --> 02:31:53,180
La la la la

1320
02:31:58,220 --> 02:32:00,220
What are you doing

1321
02:32:01,660 --> 02:32:03,660
I

1322
02:32:03,980 --> 02:32:05,980
Good

1323
02:32:08,700 --> 02:32:10,700
I messed up the timing of that

1324
02:32:19,020 --> 02:32:24,380
I want to be able I like was watching people like jump to dodge stuff and I want to be able to do that

1325
02:32:24,780 --> 02:32:26,780
I

1326
02:32:29,820 --> 02:32:31,820
Just walked into that

1327
02:32:32,380 --> 02:32:37,420
Sorry, I'm like, I'm generally just like not trying right now. I'm just fucking around. I want you to jump again

1328
02:32:41,340 --> 02:32:43,340
Damn it

1329
02:32:49,660 --> 02:32:53,100
Can you jump oh I got that time

1330
02:32:54,940 --> 02:32:56,940
Yeah

1331
02:33:01,100 --> 02:33:05,260
Yeah, no damn it. I was caught in the animation of slicing you up

1332
02:33:12,460 --> 02:33:15,100
At least that those all missed because he knocked me down

1333
02:33:19,900 --> 02:33:21,900
Yeah

1334
02:33:24,700 --> 02:33:31,580
Yeah, I did what okay, maybe that just doesn't work for that. Yeah, maybe it only works when he stomps

1335
02:33:41,580 --> 02:33:44,460
I wish I could roll out of the way instead of you know, like slicing you

1336
02:33:54,700 --> 02:33:58,300
What oh my god, I'm so happy I healed

1337
02:34:06,060 --> 02:34:08,220
Let's get down to business

1338
02:34:08,220 --> 02:34:13,340
I like how the one I wasn't trying on is the one that actually killed him that makes sense

1339
02:34:14,220 --> 02:34:16,220
That makes a lot of sense

1340
02:34:17,500 --> 02:34:19,500
Let me go heal

1341
02:34:20,300 --> 02:34:23,420
This is our DLC or a dawn

1342
02:34:26,300 --> 02:34:33,340
Hello, hi, are you winning? I just bleaked on my hand. That's nice. All right. Um

1343
02:34:37,980 --> 02:34:43,340
Let's go to the sewers first because we're like right there anyways

1344
02:34:49,500 --> 02:34:51,500
I

1345
02:34:53,020 --> 02:34:56,940
Pops it up and down oh and all around. Don't you fucking do it?

1346
02:34:59,660 --> 02:35:03,500
They're here, right? I know there's the worm

1347
02:35:13,900 --> 02:35:15,900
Not to sewers

1348
02:35:16,860 --> 02:35:21,340
I'm not gonna bother him. He's just doing his own thing. You know, we're not gonna bother him

1349
02:35:28,540 --> 02:35:33,660
Guilty gear parkour not this way. What do you mean not this way?

1350
02:35:37,740 --> 02:35:39,740
You said the sewers

1351
02:35:46,140 --> 02:35:51,900
You need to go down a well. Oh, okay. I'm gonna die of these rats. So it doesn't matter. Oh, just kidding

1352
02:35:53,500 --> 02:35:55,500
Frick

1353
02:35:55,660 --> 02:35:57,660
Where's the well? Oh

1354
02:35:58,220 --> 02:36:00,860
That's that's I know where the well is

1355
02:36:02,060 --> 02:36:05,900
The well is over here though. I need to go up the ladder

1356
02:36:09,500 --> 02:36:12,300
Hi, let me get this grace

1357
02:36:13,020 --> 02:36:19,900
Isn't there an evader like around here? Oh, I'm near Fia's bed

1358
02:36:29,580 --> 02:36:31,580
Oh

1359
02:36:34,140 --> 02:36:36,780
Hmm now I can dress some little death bed dress

1360
02:36:37,500 --> 02:36:45,100
Like oh, he's just like really just really bummed. She's not here. Um

1361
02:36:52,460 --> 02:36:54,460
Enjoy Dark Souls

1362
02:36:56,060 --> 02:37:00,140
Yeah, it's like that one dude. Where is the well I actually ever I know

1363
02:37:00,860 --> 02:37:04,300
I picturing it in my mind. I cannot remember where it is though

1364
02:37:07,660 --> 02:37:09,660
I

1365
02:37:16,540 --> 02:37:18,540
Should I attempt to kill this guy

1366
02:37:28,540 --> 02:37:31,660
No, oh, it's not very nice

1367
02:37:37,100 --> 02:37:40,220
I remember I died to that dude like 50 times before what the hell was that?

1368
02:37:44,620 --> 02:37:47,580
Church, I mean if uh, okay, thank you. I will try that

1369
02:37:51,740 --> 02:37:56,860
Let me sit down. Does he respawn if he does? I don't think he does because he dropped an item

1370
02:37:57,180 --> 02:38:06,060
Exit church jump over rabble

1371
02:38:19,260 --> 02:38:23,740
I don't think I can jump over this rabble, but I knew to get it on that side, right

1372
02:38:27,100 --> 02:38:29,100
Oh

1373
02:38:29,420 --> 02:38:35,340
Frick I do need to get on that side. Yeah, let me just oh, you're still here

1374
02:38:38,300 --> 02:38:42,380
Oh, I didn't drop that. Oh, I can't teleport without killing you

1375
02:38:48,300 --> 02:38:50,300
You have crazy good boys stop it

1376
02:38:50,300 --> 02:38:52,300
Oh

1377
02:38:55,020 --> 02:38:59,500
There's definitely a way to parkour out of this side. I don't know why I can't do maybe if I just jump down here

1378
02:39:01,900 --> 02:39:04,540
Oh, okay got some rats

1379
02:39:07,100 --> 02:39:09,100
Oh, not the spiders

1380
02:39:11,180 --> 02:39:13,180
No, I went the wrong way

1381
02:39:16,460 --> 02:39:18,460
How are you doing here?

1382
02:39:20,380 --> 02:39:22,380
I

1383
02:39:25,260 --> 02:39:31,260
I'm pretty sure I'm near another boss. Oh, no, I hate these. I hate these. I hate these so they actually jump scare me

1384
02:39:33,260 --> 02:39:35,260
They freak me the freak out

1385
02:39:36,860 --> 02:39:38,860
I hate them so freaking much

1386
02:39:44,780 --> 02:39:46,780
Yeah, that's a strange variable

1387
02:39:47,740 --> 02:39:49,740
Oh, I can't see

1388
02:40:06,380 --> 02:40:08,380
And I'm behind the Lindell soldiers, right

1389
02:40:10,380 --> 02:40:12,380
This is a big big guy

1390
02:40:13,420 --> 02:40:15,420
Too bad he dead

1391
02:40:15,420 --> 02:40:17,420
Somebody gonna clean that up

1392
02:40:23,180 --> 02:40:25,180
That's big head piece those black

1393
02:40:25,820 --> 02:40:32,620
Bags actually invoke paranoia and fear unaware. I'm sorry. Oh, I hate it. I hate it. I hate it. I hate it

1394
02:40:33,180 --> 02:40:35,180
I hate it

1395
02:40:40,380 --> 02:40:42,380
The walls over here, right

1396
02:40:43,340 --> 02:40:46,620
It's on that rubble if you go over that rubble, right?

1397
02:40:52,140 --> 02:40:54,140
To my left. Oh

1398
02:40:57,340 --> 02:41:03,420
Found it. What this? Oh fuck die. I'm surprised I didn't wake you up

1399
02:41:12,380 --> 02:41:14,700
All right, the fuck is gonna jump out at me

1400
02:41:18,860 --> 02:41:20,860
Die come here

1401
02:41:25,660 --> 02:41:29,020

Yeah, there's a lot of paths all roads lead to lindell

1405
02:41:54,780 --> 02:41:56,780
All right, I'm not looking forward to this

1406
02:41:58,220 --> 02:42:05,580
Not at all I feel like I feel like I don't have any cookbooks or anything. So I don't have okay. Please get off this freaking ladder

1407
02:42:07,020 --> 02:42:09,020
So I don't have any like poison stuff

1408
02:42:13,100 --> 02:42:15,100
Although there's not poison in this water

1409
02:42:17,580 --> 02:42:19,900
I'm waiting for something to drop out at me

1410
02:42:26,300 --> 02:42:28,300
I can't see anything

1411
02:42:33,900 --> 02:42:35,900
Subterranean pooping grounds

1412
02:42:37,340 --> 02:42:40,300
So I'm gonna have to be right in the city because it's serious because I was looking for something to carry on

1413
02:42:41,020 --> 02:42:43,020

Just wasting fp

1417
02:42:57,420 --> 02:42:59,420
Did she just dodge me

1418
02:42:59,740 --> 02:43:01,740
Oh

02:43:05,820 --> 02:43:12,540
Someone's pissing down here. Oh, oh didn't see you there. Oh, I'm not locked on

02:43:17,500 --> 02:43:20,460
Whoa, just waste fp on some rats

02:43:20,460 --> 02:43:22,460
I

1422
02:43:27,340 --> 02:43:29,340
Was locked in a rubber room

1423
02:43:32,220 --> 02:43:39,980
Yeah, the shunning ground. Oh, what the fuck are you? I hit you from here. Oh, I can

1424
02:43:42,380 --> 02:43:44,380
I don't need fp though

1425
02:43:45,180 --> 02:43:47,180
I hear something screeching at me

1426
02:43:47,180 --> 02:43:51,980
Anything up here with me? No, uh, what about magic lymph late? How do you feel about that?

No, what okay, what about rock sling? How do you feel about that?

1428
02:44:03,500 --> 02:44:08,940
Okay, what about the comet? How do you feel about that? All right, you don't like that more

1429
02:44:10,700 --> 02:44:12,940
Uh, you got a lot of blight going on

1430
02:44:12,940 --> 02:44:21,740
I'm gonna wait for you to get away from the ladder because that's just not fair

1431
02:44:23,740 --> 02:44:26,220

02:46:31,100 --> 02:46:33,100
Oh, I didn't know there was a hand there

1451
02:46:33,100 --> 02:46:35,100

Bro, I'm just dumb right now

1456
02:47:12,060 --> 02:47:14,060
That's right there

1457
02:47:21,340 --> 02:47:28,540
It doesn't even matter it doesn't even matter I just went back to where I was I'm just gonna

1458
02:47:34,060 --> 02:47:36,060
I

1459
02:47:36,700 --> 02:47:38,700
I don't even know if that was the right spot

1460
02:47:47,180 --> 02:47:49,180
Okay

1461
02:47:50,860 --> 02:47:54,220
Is it an everglow? Okay, I'm in the wrong place

1462
02:48:03,740 --> 02:48:05,740
I

1463
02:48:13,980 --> 02:48:15,980
Don't talk back to Toma

1464
02:48:21,180 --> 02:48:23,180
I don't want to appreciate this ass

1465
02:48:26,620 --> 02:48:30,780
I'm just trying my best she knows it. I know it. We all know it

1466
02:48:33,980 --> 02:48:38,540
All right, let's go to this freaking oh freak

1467
02:48:47,100 --> 02:48:49,100
I didn't mean to go down there

1468
02:48:54,700 --> 02:48:56,700
I didn't even mean to heal

1469
02:49:03,180 --> 02:49:05,180
I

1470
02:49:07,980 --> 02:49:13,260
I'm getting frustrated because I literally just want to get to the freaking DLC dude and I keep going the wrong way

1471
02:49:13,980 --> 02:49:18,060
And I keep having to pick up stuff on the way that I do need

1472
02:49:19,100 --> 02:49:21,100
In the end

1473
02:49:21,740 --> 02:49:23,740
It's taking so long

1474
02:49:33,820 --> 02:49:43,980
No, because then the worms gonna pop up if I go over there

1475
02:49:52,540 --> 02:49:54,540
Oh my god

1476
02:49:57,740 --> 02:49:59,740
This tree

1477
02:50:03,740 --> 02:50:05,740
I

1478
02:50:09,900 --> 02:50:15,980
Where's this damn well, I'm not going in there. It's just a bunch of dudes. Sorry pardon

1479
02:50:19,260 --> 02:50:22,060
Pick up whatever the hell this is. Oh you guys are all gonna wake up

1480
02:50:23,500 --> 02:50:25,500
I won't grab stuff over here

1481
02:50:26,300 --> 02:50:28,300
Well, I'm here might as well

1482
02:50:29,260 --> 02:50:32,780
I was no long near nowhere near that attack

1483
02:50:40,620 --> 02:50:43,660
No, I saw you leave now let me go

1484
02:50:48,140 --> 02:50:54,060
You guys can't climb so dude, where was the stupid well

1485
02:50:58,860 --> 02:51:00,860
I

1486
02:51:01,420 --> 02:51:07,020
Hate like one thing I'd have a terrible sense of direction and where like I don't remember a lot of things with things look the same

1487
02:51:11,100 --> 02:51:13,100
So it's hard for me

1488
02:51:14,220 --> 02:51:17,580
Don't fall off. I fell off. Uh, stop locking on

1489
02:51:23,260 --> 02:51:26,140
Getting irritated getting irritated getting irritated

1490
02:51:28,300 --> 02:51:30,300
I

1491
02:51:41,340 --> 02:51:43,340
Don't want to look at the worm

1492
02:51:47,980 --> 02:51:53,260
The other side of the bridge where I jump over here where the worm is then that's gonna attack me

1493
02:51:53,980 --> 02:51:55,980
I

1494
02:51:57,820 --> 02:52:03,020
Can't tell for it. How did you get over here, dude? How did you even get over here?

1495
02:52:13,660 --> 02:52:17,180
The opposite of where the worm is at but it's I that's right here

1496
02:52:18,140 --> 02:52:25,660
And I can't go this way because then there's just dudes in here with nothing good how I

1497
02:52:32,220 --> 02:52:36,220
Can I please just please please Jesus Christ

1498
02:52:38,700 --> 02:52:40,700
I can't even I'm trying to go back

1499
02:52:42,540 --> 02:52:45,420
To the grace but someone's aggroed on me and I don't know why

1500
02:52:47,180 --> 02:52:49,180
I

1501
02:53:06,860 --> 02:53:13,260
There are dude in this room. No, I'm not fucking with you. I mean freaking with you

1502
02:53:14,220 --> 02:53:20,620
I'm climbing you fool. How did you get up here? Why aren't you climbing? Why did you pause?

1503
02:53:35,900 --> 02:53:37,900
So it was over here, where did I get

1504
02:53:38,700 --> 02:53:43,500
Because I remember I was trying to jump around I was over here and I couldn't get on that side

1505
02:53:44,300 --> 02:53:46,300
And then I had to kill this dude

1506
02:53:54,140 --> 02:53:56,140
How how

1507
02:53:57,020 --> 02:53:59,020
I

1508
02:54:05,980 --> 02:54:08,540
Jumped on a roof. Where is the roof that I jumped on?

1509
02:54:13,740 --> 02:54:16,240
And trying to retrace my steps, but I also have a bad memory

1510
02:54:26,860 --> 02:54:28,860
Oh

1511
02:54:29,580 --> 02:54:31,580
Oh

1512
02:54:54,540 --> 02:54:56,540
Using my cat to de-stress

1513
02:54:59,820 --> 02:55:01,820
That's housing wrong

1514
02:55:07,420 --> 02:55:09,420
His head

1515
02:55:12,140 --> 02:55:14,140
Good luck

1516
02:55:15,500 --> 02:55:19,420
Oh big yawn. Can I get a lick?

1517
02:55:19,420 --> 02:55:21,420
Fuck

1518
02:55:28,300 --> 02:55:30,300
My nails

1519
02:55:30,300 --> 02:55:32,300

You're so soft, why are you so soft big man? You've been using a new conditioner

1521
02:55:53,420 --> 02:56:00,860
You got that dog what you

02:56:07,900 --> 02:56:09,900
Oh, I went to the wrong one

1523
02:56:11,100 --> 02:56:14,860
I don't know why I I thought I was at the avenue but like anything I did it

1524
02:56:18,620 --> 02:56:20,620
I showed everybody your bomb

1525
02:56:23,020 --> 02:56:25,020
Let's open that dude

1526
02:56:25,500 --> 02:56:27,500
Oh, hi boy enjoyer

03:03:31,660 --> 03:03:33,820
And it's not like I'm not even raging

1566
03:03:34,940 --> 03:03:39,340
Like I'm not mad. I'm just uncomfortable for summary. I'm just feeling very uncomfortable

1567
03:03:41,420 --> 03:03:43,420
I

1568
03:03:47,820 --> 03:03:51,100
Never finished the sewer thing because I hate the sewer thing

1569
03:04:02,460 --> 03:04:04,460

03:04:40,460 --> 03:04:42,460
I

1574
03:05:10,860 --> 03:05:12,860
I

1575
03:05:15,740 --> 03:05:17,740
This is a leftover cake that I see

1576
03:05:40,460 --> 03:05:54,140
All right, I want to give boomi a smooch

1577
03:06:03,580 --> 03:06:05,580
My cake on your head

1578
03:06:10,460 --> 03:06:12,460
I

1579
03:06:40,460 --> 03:06:43,260
Don't

1580
03:07:10,460 --> 03:07:25,340
I'm like, I'm looking stuff up. No, I look up a lot of stuff. This isn't my first time

1581
03:07:25,340 --> 03:07:34,580
playing. I did a lot of research for the DLC, but I just haven't played in a really long

1582
03:07:34,580 --> 03:07:46,260
time, so I have a travel-sensory direction in games and outside of games. Yeah, the

1583
03:07:46,260 --> 03:08:05,180
stewards just really bother me. I'm just trying to get the shackle. I apologize, sometimes

1584
03:08:05,180 --> 03:08:22,120
I just have reactions like that. I swear I'm not autistic. I just want to eat the cream

1585
03:08:22,120 --> 03:08:47,520
cheese. It's more got shackle because I bought it other than its patches.

1586
03:08:47,520 --> 03:08:57,040
No, I already have Moog unlocked. I'm just trying to get the shackle, but thank you.

1587
03:08:57,040 --> 03:09:17,120
What the heck has happened to your hand? It'd be okay if you were. Thank you.

1588
03:09:17,120 --> 03:09:37,800
Yeah, sorry, Marget. I have Marget Marget. Again, I don't remember. Just to be him because

1589
03:09:37,800 --> 03:09:53,560
I know I'll probably need it just of how I am. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm

1590
03:09:53,560 --> 03:10:07,600
sorry. I'm just really kid-ish right now. I'm really sorry. I'll try to be more serious.

1591
03:10:07,600 --> 03:10:32,680
I'm just embarrassed. I'm just embarrassed. I'm just not going to even bother. I can't

1592
03:10:32,680 --> 03:11:02,520
calm down here. They can't help me. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.

1672
03:23:16,020 --> 03:23:18,260
It's the control thing with the OCC

I'm sorry to wake you I need to hold your pouch for support

1674

03:23:29,780 --> 03:23:31,780

1678
03:24:10,980 --> 03:24:14,900
Think I'm just PMSing mentally ill

1679
03:24:30,360 --> 03:24:34,300

03:25:00,300 --> 03:25:10,300
Where do I go now?

1682
03:25:31,300 --> 03:25:34,300

1683
03:25:43,300 --> 03:25:44,300
Hey, what?

1684
03:25:48,300 --> 03:25:50,300
Wrong way, sweetie.

1685
03:25:50,300 --> 03:26:07,300
I don't know how he can lock on me when I'm not near them.

1686
03:26:07,300 --> 03:26:16,300
I'm sorry, I'm a big baby today.

1687
03:26:16,300 --> 03:26:28,300
I'm just embarrassed, because I'm supposed to be the big tough mad, I'm being a little weird.

1688
03:26:28,300 --> 03:26:30,300
Where am I going?

1689
03:26:30,300 --> 03:26:37,300
I have to do more.

1690
03:26:37,300 --> 03:26:43,300
It's hard trying to be tough all the time.

1691
03:26:43,300 --> 03:26:50,300
I've been very stressed, I'll be honest, I think that's what it is.

1692
03:26:50,300 --> 03:26:56,300
I don't think he would hit me, no.

1693
03:26:56,300 --> 03:27:00,300
So I think that's why I'm a big baby, I just want to be baby right now.

1694
03:27:00,300 --> 03:27:02,300
What's this?

1695
03:27:02,300 --> 03:27:08,300
I'm distracted by shiny, don't hit me.

1697
03:27:11,300 --> 03:27:14,300

1699
03:27:18,300 --> 03:27:21,300
You can't, you can't come.

1700
03:27:21,300 --> 03:27:25,300
It's not allowed, you can't come over here.

1701
03:27:25,300 --> 03:27:28,300
No, no, go away.

1702
03:27:28,300 --> 03:27:37,300
It's not allowed, it's not allowed, it's not allowed, it's not allowed, it's not allowed, it's not allowed.

1703
03:27:47,300 --> 03:27:50,300
What a weird place to land.

1704
03:27:55,300 --> 03:28:00,300
Yeah, I honestly think that's it, I've just been stressed.

1705
03:28:00,300 --> 03:28:09,300
And I think I just really haven't accepted it, that I'm stressed.

1706
03:28:09,300 --> 03:28:13,300
Because I'm by myself, so I'm responsible for myself.

1707
03:28:13,300 --> 03:28:19,300
So I'm just kind of got to do things alone.

1708
03:28:19,300 --> 03:28:22,300
Is that the right way?

1709
03:28:22,300 --> 03:28:30,300
Was I going the right way? Is this the right way?

1710
03:28:30,300 --> 03:28:35,300
Oh, um, excuse me motherfucker, I thought you were asleep, so I left you alone.

1711
03:28:35,300 --> 03:28:45,300
Oh, okay, well, okay.

1712
03:28:45,300 --> 03:28:48,300
I was hoping I could dodge at a time.

1713
03:28:48,300 --> 03:28:56,300
Oh, stop, stop, stop, just stop, just stop.

1714
03:28:56,300 --> 03:29:02,300
Okay.

1715
03:29:02,300 --> 03:29:11,300
You still love me even when I'm a big baby?

1716
03:29:11,300 --> 03:29:17,300
I need a hug.

1717
03:29:17,300 --> 03:29:33,300
It's like, I can't even like go like play and just stop and pretend to be like big boss mad when I just don't have the mentality to do that.

1718
03:29:41,300 --> 03:29:47,300
How am I supposed to get higher than that?

1719
03:29:47,300 --> 03:29:51,300
Over here?

1720
03:29:51,300 --> 03:30:10,300
Hmm.

1721
03:30:10,300 --> 03:30:15,300
Okay, thank you.

1722
03:30:15,300 --> 03:30:19,300
Thank you for accepting all parts of me.

1723
03:30:19,300 --> 03:30:21,300
I accept all parts of you too.

1724
03:30:21,300 --> 03:30:25,300
Am I going to have to fight these guys? I just really don't want to.

1725
03:30:25,300 --> 03:30:29,300
I really don't want to.

1726
03:30:40,300 --> 03:30:48,300
Hmm.

1727
03:30:48,300 --> 03:30:53,300
Yeah, I saw the fucking coming.

1728
03:30:53,300 --> 03:30:59,300
666, that's a double number.

1729
03:30:59,300 --> 03:31:08,300
Is the grace a little ahead? Yeah, isn't there one over here?

1730
03:31:08,300 --> 03:31:20,300
I don't even know where I would get lobster from.

1731
03:31:20,300 --> 03:31:23,300
Oh, not this guy.

1732
03:31:23,300 --> 03:31:33,300
Like, how are you just listening to them?

1733
03:31:33,300 --> 03:31:35,300
That's so crazy.

1734
03:31:35,300 --> 03:31:43,300
Level design of Lindell is my favorite because everything's like just, you just really see the sheer scale of everything between that dragon.

1735
03:31:43,300 --> 03:31:46,300
And I don't even remember, but who's that dragon anyways? I forget.

1736
03:31:46,300 --> 03:31:52,300
I have to look that up.

1737
03:31:52,300 --> 03:31:54,300
It's just like, it's just crazy to me.

1738
03:31:54,300 --> 03:32:02,300
Like, who did that? Who did all that?

1739
03:32:03,300 --> 03:32:05,300
Yeah, that's right.

1740
03:32:05,300 --> 03:32:16,300
That's what I call it. Grants access bolt.

1741
03:32:16,300 --> 03:32:31,300
Like, one of my favorite things I've been learning about lately is like the crucible and like old, like pre or tree lands between.

1742
03:32:31,300 --> 03:32:39,300
And it's like, because Parthenax or Parthenax, I can't remember his name, was an Elden Lord.

1743
03:32:39,300 --> 03:32:45,300
But like, nobody knows like to whom he was the consort to yet.

1744
03:32:45,300 --> 03:32:52,300
And I thought that was super interesting because it's like talking about how you see like the Elden Ring.

1745
03:32:52,300 --> 03:33:00,300
You can see its wildness and the crucible was still very strong.

1746
03:33:01,300 --> 03:33:04,300
Yeah, no, I know I can get to that.

1747
03:33:04,300 --> 03:33:06,300
I got the frenzied flame ending.

1748
03:33:14,300 --> 03:33:16,300
Yeah, on the Glomai Queen.

1749
03:33:16,300 --> 03:33:19,300
The God skin. Yeah, like that's so interesting to me.

1750
03:33:19,300 --> 03:33:28,300
What was the thing?

1751
03:33:28,300 --> 03:33:38,300
Like, I like the fact that people always have the crucible was like, it's not like an actual tree that was consumed by the tree.

1752
03:33:38,300 --> 03:33:44,300
But then people are starting to realize that it's almost like a force.

1753
03:33:45,300 --> 03:33:55,300
And the crucible was a type of like force, like a different sort of energy, pre or tree, pre gold and order, all that stuff.

1754
03:33:55,300 --> 03:34:02,300
And it was kind of untamed and like just represented like all life.

1755
03:34:02,300 --> 03:34:06,300
Yeah, primordial energy. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1756
03:34:07,300 --> 03:34:14,300
Recently, I've been learning about the Outer Gods and how I kind of pictured them.

1757
03:34:14,300 --> 03:34:18,300
And I like because I watched this video by Smogetown.

1758
03:34:18,300 --> 03:34:24,300
Very good lore analysis channel, I highly recommend you check it out.

1759
03:34:24,300 --> 03:34:43,300
And they dive into because like I always thought the Outer Gods were like Eldritch beings like kind of like Outer entities that are similar to the greater well, maybe a little, a little smaller, but like also like just entities.

1760
03:34:44,300 --> 03:35:04,300
But when I was listening to this video, I talked about how they're again Japanese translations and stuff that it's more of Outer Gods because they're outside of the current order of things, the golden order, they're not part of this order.

1761
03:35:04,300 --> 03:35:09,300
So they're Outer Gods.

1762
03:35:09,300 --> 03:35:24,300
Another thing that I liked is the Japanese translation kind of sees them as their Kami and Kami is a God or like a spiritual representation of a thing, but not like a God God, like an old God.

1763
03:35:24,300 --> 03:35:27,300
That's more of like Dark Souls and stuff.

1764
03:35:27,300 --> 03:35:37,300
So it's like the God, Outer God of Ra is just like the spiritual just manifestation of Ra.

1765
03:35:37,300 --> 03:35:45,300
And it's not like an actual entity.

1766
03:35:45,300 --> 03:35:57,300
It's like all the forms of the Outer Gods are different forms of death because you have like the formless mother, which is blood and bleeding and dying that way.

1767
03:35:57,300 --> 03:36:00,300
And then you have the God of Ra, which is like decay.

1768
03:36:00,300 --> 03:36:05,300
And then you have like the death birds and the ghost flame and all that stuff.

1769
03:36:05,300 --> 03:36:08,300
And that's just kind of like death by that.

1770
03:36:08,300 --> 03:36:19,300
It's interesting how all the Outer Gods represent a form of death.

1771
03:36:19,300 --> 03:36:25,300
It's very interesting to me, but they're not physical entities, they're just energies.

1772
03:36:25,300 --> 03:36:34,300
It's just a spiritual representation of a thing of an existence.

1773
03:36:34,300 --> 03:36:38,300
It's really fascinating.

1774
03:36:38,300 --> 03:36:53,300
And then that all, and it all just comes down to like the greater will just cares about order, doesn't care about what order there is, what type of control there is, it's just order.

1775
03:36:53,300 --> 03:37:02,300
I'm self soothing with Elden Ring Lore right now.

1776
03:37:02,300 --> 03:37:08,300
Yes.

1777
03:37:08,300 --> 03:37:11,300
Well, that's just my opinion.

1778
03:37:11,300 --> 03:37:25,300
I just share this opinion with this YouTuber, this YouTuber that the Outer Gods are not actual Eldritch beings that are like gods that are fighting for control from the greater will.

1779
03:37:25,300 --> 03:37:37,300
They are just forces that also exist like the Crucible and are just all wanting their own control, you know?

1780
03:37:37,300 --> 03:37:42,300
Yes, and all of them seemingly came around the death was injury. Yeah, exactly.

1781
03:37:42,300 --> 03:37:48,300
The God probably for yes, because death was finally present. Exactly.

1782
03:37:48,300 --> 03:37:57,300
In America, I will talk a lot about America's lore when I get to the DLC.

1783
03:37:57,300 --> 03:38:13,300
Yeah, a lot of things came to be like, I love the concept of duality in this game and light and darkness, like, you know, Shadow of the Ertree, then you have like Radigan America of Micola and Satrina.

1784
03:38:13,300 --> 03:38:24,300
And it's like you attain the sort of Godhood you get split into and it's like, it's very reminiscent of the defined feminine and defined masculine.

1785
03:38:24,300 --> 03:38:34,300
And it just, because like my belief, because people like to argue that Radigan was his own separate entity before America and she like absorbed him.

1786
03:38:34,300 --> 03:38:47,300
I don't believe that. I believe that when America reached Godhood, it just split her into the highest form of herself, which is two beings that define feminine and the divine masculine.

1787
03:38:47,300 --> 03:38:58,300
Yeah. Yeah, the Frenzy Flame is chaos, chaotic death. That's the Outer God, the Outer God of the Frenzy Flame.

1788
03:38:58,300 --> 03:39:02,300
It's chaos, Outer God of Chaos.

1789
03:39:02,300 --> 03:39:22,300
Yeah, Decay and Rebirth is very prevalent and there's a lot of Christian parallels in Eldering that I actually really like too, to be honest with you.

1790
03:39:23,300 --> 03:39:27,300
Chaos equals death.

1791
03:39:27,300 --> 03:39:40,300
Well, it's just, it's unbridled. There's no control. It's just chaos. There's no order at all, technically. So it just leads to death.

1792
03:39:40,300 --> 03:39:43,300
Almost like unnecessary death.

1793
03:39:43,300 --> 03:39:47,300
Radigan America's Topa.

1794
03:39:47,300 --> 03:39:53,300
Yeah, they can separate themselves. Yeah, can separate themselves from St. Trina.

1795
03:39:53,300 --> 03:40:08,300
Before, like when I first played the game, I thought St. Trina, I always thought St. Trina was Micola, but he just like, it was his alter ego, not like they're actually two separate beings, which is very interesting to me.

1796
03:40:08,300 --> 03:40:18,300
Yeah, exactly. It's like, life is gone, life is, that is the ultimate form is just unbridled chaos and death.

1797
03:40:18,300 --> 03:40:23,300
Yeah, Trina deserved better. Trina just wanted the best for Micola.

1798
03:40:23,300 --> 03:40:29,300
I'm trying to come chat with Stacey.

1799
03:40:29,300 --> 03:40:47,300
But yeah, no, I love the creation stuff of like the lands between and the gods, like analyzing that in the cultural systems, because there's so many different cultural systems, like learning about like the deathbirds, how like before, like when death did come to be

1800
03:40:48,300 --> 03:41:04,300
Before the Erd Tree, like they had a job, it was their job to take care of death, and that is evident from the weapon that they carried, the item description, I forget the name of it.

1801
03:41:04,300 --> 03:41:10,300
Chaos, life is not, yeah, yes, not exactly. Yeah, okay, I totally agree.

1802
03:41:10,300 --> 03:41:20,300
But it's like, it's like life cannot be consistent almost, you know.

1803
03:41:20,300 --> 03:41:32,300
I didn't listen to the Dung Eater's lore yet, to be honest. I don't know a lot about that, but God, that like the Dung Eater follows.

1804
03:41:32,300 --> 03:41:48,300
The Formless Mother is very interesting to me, because when he does his attack, he reaches into her existence, her plane, to grab that flame and blood.

1805
03:41:48,300 --> 03:42:06,300
And it's everything, it's so interesting because like Al, there's like fire is represented, like you have the frenzied flame, you have the Formless Mother's like blood flame, you have the ghost flame, and it's all kind of ties back to this opposition of the Erd Tree.

1806
03:42:06,300 --> 03:42:16,300
And you realize why America is trying to suppress all other possibilities, because it's like a threat to her creation.

1807
03:42:18,300 --> 03:42:29,300
And honestly, like, I'm kind of happy, and hindsight, I picked the frenzied flame ending, because I don't want to be America's consort.

1808
03:42:29,300 --> 03:42:36,300
I want to destroy everything she created, because she did it terribly, she's a crappy God.

1809
03:42:36,300 --> 03:42:45,300
So is Mikula, the whole family sucks.

1810
03:42:45,300 --> 03:42:49,300
Yeah, no no zone.

1811
03:42:49,300 --> 03:42:57,300
But yeah, it's very, very interesting, but sorry. Sorry for the tangent, I was self soothing with Elden Ring Lore. I just love Elden Ring Lore so much.

1812
03:42:57,300 --> 03:43:08,300
Look, he's just listening. I don't want to interrupt.

1813
03:43:08,300 --> 03:43:11,300
Oh, they're having a good time.

1814
03:43:11,300 --> 03:43:15,300
Can I just dump down here? Yeah.

1815
03:43:21,300 --> 03:43:26,300
Isn't there doggies? Yes.

1816
03:43:26,300 --> 03:43:29,300
Can I hit you from here?

1817
03:43:29,300 --> 03:43:32,300
Nope, can you come close doggie?

1818
03:43:32,300 --> 03:43:37,300
No, okay, there's two doggies.

1819
03:43:39,300 --> 03:43:46,300
The cast time is very, very long, though.

1820
03:43:46,300 --> 03:43:54,300
I'll take whatever fricking bones you got. Oh, Beast Blood.

1821
03:43:54,300 --> 03:44:01,300
Elden Ring Lore video went? Oh, maybe. I wouldn't mind doing that.

1822
03:44:01,300 --> 03:44:30,300
I also really like the, I've already got their name. It's like the Tarnished Archaeologists, they like dive into all the cultural influences, like the historical influences, like physical archaeological finds and comparisons and how they have been incorporated into Elden Ring and like the different cultures and stuff, and that was really cool.

1823
03:44:31,300 --> 03:44:46,300
And there's also the character that's in like, Mawgwin Palace that people call like Elden John, which is funny, and they think that he was some sort of Elden Lord, but I don't think so.

1824
03:44:46,300 --> 03:44:56,300
I think he was actually a preacher, like a prophet that was prophesying, almost like a Jesus type character or like, no, not like Jesus.

1825
03:44:56,300 --> 03:45:04,300
What was the prophet? Which prophet? I'm trying to think of a specific prophet in the book, in the Bible, and I can't remember.

1826
03:45:04,300 --> 03:45:12,300
Who ever wrote the book of Revelation? And I feel like he was kind of, I think, was it Daniel? I don't remember.

1827
03:45:12,300 --> 03:45:19,300
And I feel like he's kind of the equivalent of telling people that the world as they knew it was ending.

1828
03:45:19,300 --> 03:45:35,300
That's my idea. He was pro-clear, because it shows in on the slab that he's holding, it's a tree, which people said like, oh, he could have been like something about the crucible or something.

1829
03:45:35,300 --> 03:45:44,300
And like, when we get to the DLC, I'll talk about the spirals and stuff and like the horn scent and their cultural ideals and stuff.

1830
03:45:45,300 --> 03:45:56,300
But like, I feel like it was the ur-tree on his tablet, and he was predicting the golden order.

1831
03:45:59,300 --> 03:46:07,300
This is going to take a while. I'm just going to run past these people. I'm so sorry. Oh yeah, you're not really doing anything.

1832
03:46:08,300 --> 03:46:14,300
Yippee! I'm terrified of heights and platforming.

1833
03:46:14,300 --> 03:46:18,300
Oh, like how y'all get triggered, like one at a time.

1834
03:46:18,300 --> 03:46:36,300
Oh, no, I really don't want you guys here. We can't really do this now, please. Oh, I'm going to get poisoned.

1835
03:46:39,300 --> 03:46:42,300
Okay, well, I'm going to let that go down.

1836
03:46:43,300 --> 03:46:53,300
Oh, come on, guys. Why aren't you diagrowing yet? Oh, come on. Oh, I didn't mean to do that. I wanted to do that.

1837
03:46:53,300 --> 03:47:02,300
Oh, frick. Oh, frack and fro. Oh, man. You know what? I'm going to use the mimic tier, because I'm not having a good time.

1838
03:47:02,300 --> 03:47:15,300
Go do something. Go do something about that, right now.

1839
03:47:20,300 --> 03:47:25,300
Oh, God. Although, I know he's not that bad, actually.

1840
03:47:33,300 --> 03:47:40,300
Oh, I wasn't paying attention to my health. That's awkward.

1841
03:47:47,300 --> 03:47:50,300
Yeah, I feel like they should have died more into Erlana's stuff.

1842
03:47:51,300 --> 03:47:56,300
Oh, well, am I? I think I'm like 132.

1843
03:48:06,300 --> 03:48:09,300
Oh, why could I see him for a second? That was weird.

1844
03:48:10,300 --> 03:48:18,300
I feel like this will be...

1845
03:48:31,300 --> 03:48:32,300
Hold on.

1846
03:48:33,300 --> 03:48:39,300
Hold on. No, stay stuck behind that pole. I got stuff over here to do.

1847
03:48:41,300 --> 03:48:42,300
Nope, pull out.

1848
03:48:50,300 --> 03:48:55,300
Go do something, mimic tier. Do something about that.

1849
03:48:56,300 --> 03:48:58,300
I don't want to be stuck in a corner.

1850
03:48:59,300 --> 03:49:04,300
Fight over here, please. No, you're already going to die.

1851
03:49:05,300 --> 03:49:07,300
You frick. I'm over here.

1852
03:49:11,300 --> 03:49:16,300
No, I was using you for bait. I nearly weren't touched.

1853
03:49:17,300 --> 03:49:19,300
Oh, that does blow damage, actually.

1854
03:49:29,300 --> 03:49:30,300
Oh.

1855
03:49:39,300 --> 03:49:44,300
Oh, please. I'm not ready to die.

1856
03:49:46,300 --> 03:49:48,300
Looks like I really didn't need to mimic tier.

1857
03:49:49,300 --> 03:49:50,300
Ow.

1858
03:49:51,300 --> 03:49:53,300
I'm not getting the timing right.

1859
03:49:58,300 --> 03:49:59,300
Ow.

1860
03:50:09,300 --> 03:50:10,300
Oh, no.

1861
03:50:29,300 --> 03:50:30,300
Oh.

1862
03:50:34,300 --> 03:50:36,300
Nothing personal, kid.

1863
03:50:44,300 --> 03:50:50,300
I had to use the watch of a college.

1864
03:50:59,300 --> 03:51:06,300
The moon veil. I always like to feel like cheese with a bunch of spells and then I'll just...

1865
03:51:07,300 --> 03:51:14,300
And then I'll just do it with my weapon and feel like I did it without any help.

1866
03:51:15,300 --> 03:51:18,300
Okay, now to get the icon.

1867
03:51:25,300 --> 03:51:27,300
I'll bite a cake.

1868
03:51:28,300 --> 03:51:30,300
Celebratory cake, Grapple Me.

1869
03:51:35,300 --> 03:51:37,300
Celebratory cake.

1870
03:51:39,300 --> 03:51:41,300
This cake is so good.

1871
03:51:41,300 --> 03:51:47,300
Ooh, me. Why are you so adorable?

1872
03:51:50,300 --> 03:51:52,300
Yeah, where is that?

1873
03:51:58,300 --> 03:52:00,300
Wait, do I have to kill Godfrey for it?

1874
03:52:01,300 --> 03:52:08,300
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1875
03:52:09,300 --> 03:52:11,300
Wait, do I have to kill Godfrey for it?

1876
03:52:24,300 --> 03:52:26,300
Okay, I'll fight.

1877
03:52:26,300 --> 03:52:27,300
Mm-hmm.

1878
03:52:37,300 --> 03:52:39,300
Yeah, she thought the fight was hilarious.

1879
03:52:40,300 --> 03:52:45,300
She was just like, yeah, no, give me the, give me the voids.

1880
03:52:45,300 --> 03:52:49,300
I'm gonna click that real quick and I'm like, it was members.

1881
03:52:49,300 --> 03:52:52,300
She's like, ah, frickin', goddammit.

1882
03:52:56,300 --> 03:52:58,300
And she's like, download and send it to me.

1883
03:53:01,300 --> 03:53:04,300
I'm like, okay, she's like, wait, never mind, I'll just get into your account and get it myself.

1884
03:53:04,300 --> 03:53:06,300
I'm like, okay.

1885
03:53:27,300 --> 03:53:29,300
She said I could write the script.

1886
03:53:31,300 --> 03:53:32,300
She said I could write the script.

1887
03:53:35,300 --> 03:53:36,300
I begged her again.

1888
03:53:36,300 --> 03:53:37,300
She said fine.

1889
03:53:37,300 --> 03:53:39,300
She didn't say fine, like, oh my god, fine.

1890
03:53:39,300 --> 03:53:43,300
She was like, all right, I just don't want you getting stressed out.

1891
03:53:46,300 --> 03:53:55,300
So, I'm gonna do a theme based off of my Halloween outfit.

1892
03:53:57,300 --> 03:54:01,300
Maybe I'm a, oh, you never know.

1893
03:54:04,300 --> 03:54:05,300
Or maybe I'm a,

1894
03:54:13,300 --> 03:54:17,300
or maybe I'm a R, matey.

1895
03:54:20,300 --> 03:54:22,300
Where is the ever jail?

1896
03:54:23,300 --> 03:54:26,300
Where did you say it was?

1897
03:54:28,300 --> 03:54:33,300
Maybe I'm a, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more.

1898
03:54:38,300 --> 03:54:39,300
Down the ravine.

1899
03:54:39,300 --> 03:54:43,300
Do you think I know what a ravine is?

1900
03:54:44,300 --> 03:54:48,300
You gotta say south, southeast.

1901
03:54:50,300 --> 03:54:51,300
Where's southeast?

1902
03:54:51,300 --> 03:54:56,300
Oh, okay, I'm gonna go around.

1903
03:54:56,300 --> 03:54:58,300
So I'm gonna go around, I am.

1904
03:55:01,300 --> 03:55:03,300
I'm a slime girl.

1905
03:55:03,300 --> 03:55:06,300
Okay, maybe I'm a slime girl, glub glub.

1906
03:55:06,300 --> 03:55:09,300
Maybe I changed my mind a lot.

1907
03:55:10,300 --> 03:55:13,300
I don't know what a slime is, visible in the map.

1908
03:55:13,300 --> 03:55:18,300
Oh, look at that, then.

1909
03:55:21,300 --> 03:55:24,300
You're so right, Haram, you're so right.

1910
03:55:26,300 --> 03:55:28,300
I'm not a fairy.

1911
03:55:28,300 --> 03:55:31,300
Why are you guys keep saying I'm a fairy?

1912
03:55:31,300 --> 03:55:33,300
I'm not a fairy.

1913
03:55:34,300 --> 03:55:39,300
I've never been, oh, snap hola, I've never been a fairy.

1914
03:55:39,300 --> 03:55:40,300
What's that?

1915
03:55:40,300 --> 03:55:42,300
It looks pretty, I want to pick it up.

1916
03:55:42,300 --> 03:55:45,300
It's art, art terrierly.

1917
03:55:46,300 --> 03:55:52,300
I can jump down, right?

1918
03:55:52,300 --> 03:55:54,300
Yeah, that's fine.

1919
03:55:54,300 --> 03:55:56,300
Oh yeah, we're good.

1920
03:55:59,300 --> 03:56:02,300
Oh yeah, we're fine, don't worry, that's it.

1921
03:56:03,300 --> 03:56:06,300
What do you mean, the wolf quest stream?

1922
03:56:06,300 --> 03:56:10,300
What was going on in the wolf quest stream?

1923
03:56:11,300 --> 03:56:16,300
It's funny that you have to unlock it.

1924
03:56:20,300 --> 03:56:21,300
Excuse me.

1925
03:56:23,300 --> 03:56:26,300
Is there a state of America nearby?

1926
03:56:26,300 --> 03:56:28,300
Wait, how much rooms do I have?

1927
03:56:32,300 --> 03:56:35,300
Okay, I understand, I was lost with you.

1928
03:56:35,300 --> 03:56:38,300
Tell me, okay, I have 102.

1929
03:56:38,300 --> 03:56:43,300
Alright, after I kill him, I will level.

1930
03:56:50,300 --> 03:56:51,300
Come on.

1931
03:56:57,300 --> 03:57:01,300
Oh, why did I, why am I doing this?

1932
03:57:01,300 --> 03:57:03,300
I didn't mean to press that.

1933
03:57:05,300 --> 03:57:07,300
Why am I like this?

1934
03:57:08,300 --> 03:57:12,300
Oh no, I already freaked this out.

1935
03:57:14,300 --> 03:57:16,300
Why is he in here?

1936
03:57:18,300 --> 03:57:21,300
Why am I suddenly not being able to know how to play?

1937
03:57:30,300 --> 03:57:32,300
Why is he so strong for no reason?

1938
03:57:32,300 --> 03:57:37,300
I actually just might let you kill me

1939
03:57:37,300 --> 03:57:40,300
because I just totally freaked stuff up.

1940
03:57:46,300 --> 03:57:48,300
Ow, ow.

1941
03:57:51,300 --> 03:57:54,300
Ow, you slammed my head against that.

1942
03:57:57,300 --> 03:58:01,300
I don't have any FP, oh no!

1943
03:58:03,300 --> 03:58:04,300
Yeah.

1944
03:58:13,300 --> 03:58:17,300
Walk, walk, walk, walk, walk.

1945
03:58:23,300 --> 03:58:28,300
Can I, can I get some, can I, can I please?

1946
03:58:29,300 --> 03:58:33,300
Thank you for letting me heal, I appreciate that.

1947
03:58:34,300 --> 03:58:36,300
Oh, I jumped too early.

1948
03:58:37,300 --> 03:58:38,300
I jumped too early.

1949
03:58:39,300 --> 03:58:41,300
I jumped too early on the rest.

1950
03:58:42,300 --> 03:58:45,300
Where's the bleed? Where's the bleed?

1951
03:58:47,300 --> 03:58:49,300
I jumped into that.

1952
03:58:50,300 --> 03:58:51,300
Oh no.

1953
03:58:53,300 --> 03:58:56,300
It's not that hard, I don't know why I'm struggling right now.

1954
03:58:58,300 --> 03:58:59,300
Wow.

1955
03:59:00,300 --> 03:59:03,300
Can I like breathe for a second?

1956
03:59:08,300 --> 03:59:11,300
Oh, get your little hands away from me.

1957
03:59:12,300 --> 03:59:14,300
I don't like that at all.

1958
03:59:23,300 --> 03:59:26,300
Where's my blood buildup? That's my question.

1959
03:59:27,300 --> 03:59:28,300
I'm gonna die.

1960
03:59:40,300 --> 03:59:43,300
Okay, I got cut room so I can move on.

1961
03:59:43,300 --> 03:59:44,300
Interesting.

1962
03:59:46,300 --> 03:59:49,300
God of Thru, God of Thru.

1963
03:59:51,300 --> 03:59:55,300
God of Thru, God of Rick, God of Thru.

1964
03:59:57,300 --> 04:00:12,300
God of Frick, God of Rye, God of Lick, God of Bi, God of Tick, God of Die.

1965
04:00:13,300 --> 04:00:16,300
In the Everdale, we gonna fly.

1966
04:00:17,300 --> 04:00:18,300
Yeah, I'm gonna.

1967
04:00:21,300 --> 04:00:23,300
I won't do what I did before.

1968
04:00:23,300 --> 04:00:25,300
Bye.

1969
04:00:53,300 --> 04:00:54,300
Oh.

1970
04:01:18,300 --> 04:01:19,300
Why do you do that?

1971
04:01:24,300 --> 04:01:29,300
I'm like kind of tired.

1972
04:01:30,300 --> 04:01:35,300
I'm gonna spam my thing and you're gonna spam your thing and it's just...

1973
04:01:37,300 --> 04:01:39,300
Oh, I said I'm gonna try to heal there.

1974
04:01:47,300 --> 04:01:48,300
What is happening?

1975
04:01:49,300 --> 04:01:51,300
I didn't think you were gonna be able to reach me, but you did.

1976
04:01:54,300 --> 04:01:58,300
Why can't...

1977
04:01:59,300 --> 04:02:05,300
I'm just not doing things fast enough for me to get repost or bleed.

1978
04:02:14,300 --> 04:02:16,300
Okay, I did get a little bit of lead there.

1979
04:02:24,300 --> 04:02:27,300
Oh, I'm gonna expect that.

1980
04:02:34,300 --> 04:02:35,300
What?

1981
04:02:35,300 --> 04:02:36,300
What's happening here?

1982
04:02:53,300 --> 04:03:03,300
I can never dodge that attack for some reason.

1983
04:03:24,300 --> 04:03:29,300
He's an airbender.

1984
04:03:30,300 --> 04:03:32,300
He got that Extendo range.

1985
04:03:33,300 --> 04:03:34,300
Go, go Gadgets.

1986
04:03:34,300 --> 04:03:35,300
Welly Whirl.

1987
04:03:35,300 --> 04:03:36,300
Welly Dirl.

1988
04:03:38,300 --> 04:03:39,300
That is it.

1989
04:03:39,300 --> 04:03:41,300
Okay, I feed Fia in like an hour.

1990
04:03:54,300 --> 04:03:55,300
Midra's cool.

1991
04:03:55,300 --> 04:03:57,300
I like Midra's design a lot.

1992
04:03:59,300 --> 04:04:04,300
I kind of want to listen to that lore again because I listen to the Frenzy Flame and Midra's lore,

1993
04:04:04,300 --> 04:04:05,300
but sometimes they just don't...

1994
04:04:05,300 --> 04:04:09,300
Like, I'll listen to it or read something or all this, but I don't really consume it.

1995
04:04:09,300 --> 04:04:11,300
I might have fallen asleep during that too.

1996
04:04:11,300 --> 04:04:12,300
Okay.

1997
04:04:21,300 --> 04:04:22,300
Yeah!

1998
04:04:22,300 --> 04:04:23,300
25!

1999
04:04:29,300 --> 04:04:31,300
Okay, I have 20 rooms.

2000
04:04:31,300 --> 04:04:32,300
Let me see.

2001
04:04:33,300 --> 04:04:34,300
Hmm.

2002
04:04:38,300 --> 04:04:40,300
Oh, I didn't mean to do that.

2003
04:04:47,300 --> 04:04:48,300
Always...

2004
04:04:48,300 --> 04:04:49,300
Nope.

2005
04:04:51,300 --> 04:04:52,300
I always...

2006
04:04:54,300 --> 04:04:55,300
Click the wrong things.

2007
04:04:58,300 --> 04:04:59,300
Midra was a fun fight.

2008
04:04:59,300 --> 04:05:01,300
Oh, I need a membership.

2009
04:05:02,300 --> 04:05:03,300
Okay.

2010
04:05:09,300 --> 04:05:10,300
Wow!

2011
04:05:23,300 --> 04:05:24,300
I...

2012
04:05:24,300 --> 04:05:26,300
Just not enough.

2013
04:05:26,300 --> 04:05:28,300
Why am I sitting?

2014
04:05:28,300 --> 04:05:31,300
I press the wrong buttons all the time.

2015
04:05:33,300 --> 04:05:34,300
It's been four hours.

2016
04:05:35,300 --> 04:05:37,300
Crying for the majority of it.

2017
04:05:48,300 --> 04:05:52,300
Well, I'm probably going to do this for like five, like nine hours, so...

2018
04:05:54,300 --> 04:05:55,300
Do I have more rooms?

2019
04:05:58,300 --> 04:06:00,300
Warming stone.

2020
04:06:03,300 --> 04:06:05,300
Okay, I won't...

2021
04:06:11,300 --> 04:06:13,300
Not gonna really...

2022
04:06:14,300 --> 04:06:16,300
I want to use up all of these,

2023
04:06:17,300 --> 04:06:19,300
and I'm gonna go upgrade stuff.

2024
04:06:26,300 --> 04:06:29,300
I also don't want the little ones just sitting.

2025
04:06:29,300 --> 04:06:31,300
I hate though that...

2026
04:06:32,300 --> 04:06:33,300
I just...

2027
04:06:33,300 --> 04:06:34,300
I wish it wouldn't...

2028
04:06:37,300 --> 04:06:40,300
I have to keep going into my inventory to do this.

2029
04:06:43,300 --> 04:06:44,300
Did I get the...

2030
04:06:44,300 --> 04:06:46,300
Okay, yeah, I did get that.

2031
04:06:46,300 --> 04:06:49,300
So I just couldn't remember if I got the Purifying Crystal tier.

2032
04:06:52,300 --> 04:06:53,300
Bye-bye!

2033
04:06:53,300 --> 04:06:54,300
Have a good night!

2034
04:06:54,300 --> 04:06:56,300
Thank you for stopping by.

2035
04:06:57,300 --> 04:06:59,300
I didn't mean to press that.

2036
04:07:00,300 --> 04:07:02,300
Let me get away from this thing.

2037
04:07:19,300 --> 04:07:21,300
She's singing the song over people.

2038
04:07:23,300 --> 04:07:24,300
She's not hungry.

2039
04:07:24,300 --> 04:07:26,300
She has food in her bowl.

2040
04:07:27,300 --> 04:07:29,300
Actually, I can't really tell from here.

2041
04:07:29,300 --> 04:07:31,300
I can't see over the edge of the bowl.

2042
04:07:31,300 --> 04:07:32,300
So they're actually...

2043
04:07:32,300 --> 04:07:33,300
Her food...

2044
04:07:33,300 --> 04:07:35,300
The food will go off in a little bit.

2045
04:07:35,300 --> 04:07:36,300
All right, whatever.

2046
04:07:36,300 --> 04:07:37,300
Oh, it's raining.

2047
04:07:37,300 --> 04:07:39,300
I like it when it rains with the game.

2048
04:07:40,300 --> 04:07:42,300
Eee, D. B. D. B. D.

2049
04:07:53,300 --> 04:07:55,300
All right, whatever.

2050
04:07:55,300 --> 04:07:56,300
Oh, it's raining.

2051
04:07:56,300 --> 04:07:58,300
I like to go into rain until the game.

2052
04:07:59,300 --> 04:08:01,300
Eee, D. B. D. B. D.

2053
04:08:01,300 --> 04:08:03,300
Eee, D. B. D. B. D.

2054
04:08:03,300 --> 04:08:15,300
Oh, it's getting dark. They're not able to see, which nice and cold is this, which nice and cold is this big man.

2055
04:08:27,300 --> 04:08:32,300
No, she caught a ball, her ball. She likes to yell with her toy in her mouth.

2056
04:08:34,300 --> 04:08:39,300
Reyna, what did you get? Reyna, come here.

2057
04:08:42,300 --> 04:08:45,300
What did you catch? Come bring it over here.

2058
04:08:49,300 --> 04:08:51,300
I'm asking nicely.

2059
04:08:55,300 --> 04:09:00,300
Reyna, aren't you catching the food for me? Don't you want to feed me or kitten?

2060
04:09:04,300 --> 04:09:10,300
She's still meowing. No, Boomi's leaving because he's wondering what she has.

2061
04:09:14,300 --> 04:09:19,300
Yeah, it was her victory. So when Kat like still walk around with her toy, I'd be like, I killed this toy.

2062
04:09:19,300 --> 04:09:27,300
And I usually go over and I pretend to eat it. I'm like, oh my God, thank you. So good. You did such a good job, Reyna. Wow.

2063
04:09:27,300 --> 04:09:29,300
Wow, Reyna, you're so talented.

2064
04:09:30,300 --> 04:09:38,300
She's still meowing because I haven't gone to see her yet. My Boomi's going to see her. It's funny because then she'll just hiss at Boomi.

2065
04:09:43,300 --> 04:09:49,300
She's still yelling. Let me shut this off until he comes back.

2066
04:09:49,300 --> 04:10:01,300
Don't worry. I feel so bad that Mary could put you here, you poor little omen.

2067
04:10:05,300 --> 04:10:11,300
Oh, it is kind of important. You try to get something that kills a god.

2068
04:10:15,300 --> 04:10:17,300
I don't have an eight. Damn it.

2069
04:10:20,300 --> 04:10:22,300
Where does a somber stone eat?

2070
04:10:32,300 --> 04:10:37,300
I don't need a glove wart for you. I can go buy some glove wart, actually.

2071
04:10:37,300 --> 04:10:57,300
I wish like he offered something of value. Where the heck is he? I feel like I was supposed to do something. I don't really care.

2072
04:10:57,300 --> 04:11:01,300
I don't know why his room opens if I can't do anything.

2073
04:11:08,300 --> 04:11:14,300
Wait. Am I tripping?

2074
04:11:29,300 --> 04:11:32,300
Offer a bell. I don't have a bell, do I? Oh, I do.

2075
04:11:32,300 --> 04:11:38,300
I have any more? Okay. I didn't think I had anything to offer.

2076
04:11:49,300 --> 04:11:55,300
Thank you kindly. I don't know why you're like conjoined. Again, duality.

2077
04:11:56,300 --> 04:12:01,300
I forget what his name is. It's like Kasa or something.

2078
04:12:01,300 --> 04:12:09,300
Because I was just like, what is the point of him? He's just a silent dude that hangs out off near Arkidian, whatever.

2079
04:12:09,300 --> 04:12:12,300
ID. What's going on, D?

2080
04:12:14,300 --> 04:12:20,300
Nephaly quest line time. Why do I need to do Nephaly stuff? She's not even there.

2081
04:12:21,300 --> 04:12:25,300
And it's funny because I talked to her, so I don't know what happened with that.

2082
04:12:25,300 --> 04:12:29,300
Oh, wait. I didn't mean to talk to you. I meant to come over here.

2083
04:12:30,300 --> 04:12:32,300
Greetings, we have a spirit.

2084
04:12:37,300 --> 04:12:39,300
Gold beans.

2085
04:12:42,300 --> 04:12:47,300
We can say they assomber stony. What? They definitely don't.

2086
04:12:47,300 --> 04:12:53,300
I probably have to upgrade the shop in order to do that.

2087
04:12:53,300 --> 04:12:57,300
I bet it was like, offer them this frickin bell bearing and you can do that.

2088
04:13:00,300 --> 04:13:05,300
Ma'am? Yeah. What does this do?

2089
04:13:12,300 --> 04:13:17,300
Yeah, because I'd have to do that. The crystal caves.

2090
04:13:17,300 --> 04:13:21,300
Oh, hi, Reyna. I know, you're a boomy. Wait, what the heck?

2091
04:13:21,300 --> 04:13:26,300
You psyched me out. You tricked me. You tricked me.

2092
04:13:26,300 --> 04:13:29,300
I thought you were Reyna in the darkness.

2093
04:13:34,300 --> 04:13:38,300
Okay, I'm just wearing the carrion armor, but thank you.

2094
04:13:38,300 --> 04:13:42,300
Everybody gets the carrion armor early game for an int build.

2095
04:13:45,300 --> 04:13:49,300
But thank you for your suggestion. Don't worry about it.

2096
04:13:49,300 --> 04:13:54,300
Yeah, I would have to kill those two crystal ladies to get that,

2097
04:13:54,300 --> 04:14:01,300
which would be smart, to be honest, because then I could just go.

2098
04:14:01,300 --> 04:14:07,300
What I should have been doing is I should have been going and killing all the NPCs for the bell bearings.

2099
04:14:09,300 --> 04:14:13,300
So, carrion armor is always drippy.

2100
04:14:14,300 --> 04:14:17,300
Okay, I'm going to bonk some on the stick.

2101
04:14:17,300 --> 04:14:20,300
I feel like I can do some serious damage with those crystals on the end, to be honest.

2102
04:14:20,300 --> 04:14:25,300
The fact that there isn't like a crystal sword that looks like that is kind of crazy.

2103
04:14:28,300 --> 04:14:31,300
Boomy has been a good boy. Boomy's been my emotional support.

2104
04:14:31,300 --> 04:14:40,300
Oh, it's Emmy. Hi, Emmy. Hello. Hi, Pimp Pals. Hi, Raiders. What are you guys doing?

2105
04:14:40,300 --> 04:14:44,300
What's going on? What it is? What's up?

2106
04:14:44,300 --> 04:14:49,300
I got to go to Mount Gelmere for Sombra Age.

2107
04:14:49,300 --> 04:14:53,300
See, this is the thing about Ullinary. You just get like sidetracked.

2108
04:14:53,300 --> 04:14:58,300
And I'm like, oh, I got to do this next. Oh, I got to do that.

2109
04:14:59,300 --> 04:15:02,300
Hello, Ultrabee. Hello. Hello.

2110
04:15:02,300 --> 04:15:05,300
Welcome in, Pimp Pals. How was the stream?

2111
04:15:05,300 --> 04:15:09,300
Stream 10 out of 10, yeah? I hope so.

2112
04:15:09,300 --> 04:15:13,300
You're drawing my little pony.

2113
04:15:13,300 --> 04:15:17,300
Oh, my little pony.

2114
04:15:17,300 --> 04:15:22,300
I always wondered what friendship could be.

2115
04:15:22,300 --> 04:15:25,300
I don't say my little pony rules.

2116
04:15:25,300 --> 04:15:28,300
I would love to make a pony, Sona.

2117
04:15:28,300 --> 04:15:32,300
I would just obviously be like a little rope for my cutie mark.

2118
04:15:32,300 --> 04:15:36,300
I will say it once and I will say it again.

2119
04:15:36,300 --> 04:15:41,300
But then you shared all this magic with me, my little pony.

2120
04:15:41,300 --> 04:15:49,300
Oh, Oshimarks are just cutie marks for VTubers.

2121
04:15:49,300 --> 04:15:53,300
Hi, Pookie.

2122
04:15:53,300 --> 04:15:57,300
What OC did you make? Now, I'm curious.

2123
04:15:57,300 --> 04:16:01,300
Was it one based off of yourself or did you just make your own one?

2124
04:16:01,300 --> 04:16:05,300
Or make one for Dupin Pals?

2125
04:16:05,300 --> 04:16:09,300
Exactly, yeah. Agree with me.

2126
04:16:09,300 --> 04:16:19,860
Feed my ego. That's so true. That's so true, Queen. Speak your truth, Queen. You just made yourself

2127
04:16:19,860 --> 04:16:30,100
as a pony. Cute. I bet you would look like, um, similar to this scooter or like, there's like,

2128
04:16:30,100 --> 04:16:38,700
I think Applejack's little sister. One that's like with freckles, I think. I can't remember.

2129
04:16:38,700 --> 04:16:46,140
I haven't watched my little pony in a while. Yeah, a horrible little gremlin. You guys would just be

2130
04:16:46,140 --> 04:16:56,060
like a dilapidated, disheveled, spike looking thing. Like a dragon. Scootaloo. Yeah, I always

2131
04:16:56,060 --> 04:17:08,380
like Scootaloo's name. It's so cute. Oh, what the heck? Hi, hi guys for Lulu. Hi, hi guys for Lulu.

2132
04:17:08,380 --> 04:17:15,900
Thank you for your raid. Hello. How's it going? I think you're collabing with Emmy, weren't you?

2133
04:17:16,700 --> 04:17:22,460
That's cool. Or you're going to collab. I can't recall. I haven't looked at the schedule.

2134
04:17:23,340 --> 04:17:31,180
Hi, if you're new here, Raiders, my name is Shibi Cottonbum. I am your favorite girl failure dom.

2135
04:17:31,180 --> 04:17:41,020
I am part of Veilers Gen 1 Indulge. And that's my cat Raina singing the song of her people

2136
04:17:41,740 --> 04:17:48,460
because she is playing with her ball. But thank you for the double raid. I feel very loved.

2137
04:17:48,780 --> 04:17:54,940
What I'm doing, I'm dressed up as a nun right now because I'm Seiso. I'm a Shimi Seiso. I'm the

2138
04:17:54,940 --> 04:18:08,460
most pure, virginal, even VTuber. Yes. So, and we're just like kind of doing some quick thing,

2139
04:18:08,460 --> 04:18:13,260
not quick, it's taking forever because I am slow and I talk a lot. We're doing some things where

2140
04:18:13,260 --> 04:18:20,620
I'm just kind of grabbing a couple things before I go to the DLC. I still need to kill Mogue. I

2141
04:18:20,620 --> 04:18:24,220
feel like I've been like subconsciously putting it off and getting sidetracked by other things.

2142
04:18:24,220 --> 04:18:28,540
But we'll see. But yeah, if you want to stick around, stick around. If you don't,

2143
04:18:28,540 --> 04:18:32,300
that's fine. Get some rest, get some water, take a nap, go to bed.

2144
04:18:33,500 --> 04:18:41,340
What's that? The shark boy and lava girl song? Shut your eyes. Dream, dream, dream, dream.

2145
04:18:41,340 --> 04:18:45,740
Taylor Lautner killed that. Not going to lie. Not going to lie. Your recent Twitter posts

2146
04:18:45,740 --> 04:18:52,860
with 10 degrees are true without your holiness. I don't know what you say. I do not recall what you

2147
04:18:52,860 --> 04:19:03,980
speak of. I give advice. I give advice on life. On my advice on life, stop living. Yeah. Yeah.

2148
04:19:03,980 --> 04:19:07,260
That's the best thing you could do. That's the best thing you could do.

2149
04:19:09,180 --> 04:19:18,140
I'm kidding in Minecraft in Elden Ring because there's no death in Elden Ring, you know? Dream,

2150
04:19:18,140 --> 04:19:25,900
dream, dream, dream, dream, dream. Let me give you the cutie girl ranch. The cutie, cutie girl, cutie

2151
04:19:25,900 --> 04:19:38,140
mark ranch. Nifty. Shark boy and lava girl comedy. That was a drama. I don't know what you're talking

2152
04:19:38,140 --> 04:19:45,020
about. Far into the game. What are you? Um, so I can show you right now. Beep, beep, beep. Because

2153
04:19:45,020 --> 04:19:49,500
I've just been, um, I haven't been like doing, doing stuff. I've already beat this game before

2154
04:19:49,660 --> 04:19:56,540
on my PlayStation. Oh, I didn't mean to go there. Um, I was just farming recently to get levels up,

2155
04:19:56,540 --> 04:20:05,900
and then I just got Moog Shackle. And then I just, um, I forget what I just got, to be honest with you.

2156
04:20:06,780 --> 04:20:14,380
And now I'm debating whether or not to go kill the crystal ladies for their ball bearing in the

2157
04:20:14,380 --> 04:20:21,820
mines for the somber, but I think I might just kill Moog instead. I think I need to stop. Yeah,

2158
04:20:21,820 --> 04:20:28,620
I need to, I have the good offer. I also just feel like I need better things.

2159
04:20:28,620 --> 04:20:46,220
Oh, memory stones. Oh, there's eight and nine and Caleb. Yes. I think I, do I have nine?

2160
04:20:46,860 --> 04:20:52,060
Yeah, I have nine. I literally just need eight.

2161
04:20:57,100 --> 04:20:58,700
I think I have to go get eight now.

2162
04:21:01,500 --> 04:21:09,180
Oh my God. Why do I have, oh yeah, I have two of those. Why did I buy that then? I didn't know I

2163
04:21:09,180 --> 04:21:14,220
had three. I hate that I have to go in order. Why can't I just do the biggest one?

2164
04:21:17,180 --> 04:21:23,900
I might need some spell slots. You're probably right. But where else do I get memory stones?

2165
04:21:27,340 --> 04:21:35,020
All right, well, we're going back to Caleb, Caleb, Caleb. We're going back to Caleb. I don't think so.

2166
04:21:37,180 --> 04:21:41,420
Going back to, oh hi, Boomi. Hi, are you coming back for the kitty cam?

2167
04:21:41,980 --> 04:21:49,260
Sir? Oh, you're knocking stuff over. You're tripping. You're falling.

2168
04:21:49,820 --> 04:21:56,540
Boomi, you can't be on my desk unless you go in the bed. Lay down. Good boy. Good boy,

2169
04:21:56,540 --> 04:22:02,940
Boomi. Good boy. Now he can put in the kitty cam although it's dark. He's looking his butt,

2170
04:22:02,940 --> 04:22:07,100
so maybe I shouldn't be putting on the kitty cam. Why are you so gross?

2171
04:22:14,060 --> 04:22:15,100
I can't reach my light.

2172
04:22:22,940 --> 04:22:23,420
There we go.

2173
04:22:24,220 --> 04:22:36,300
The baby boy. Why are you so far away? Come closer. I want to see you.

2174
04:22:42,060 --> 04:22:42,860
Boomi is back.

2175
04:22:42,860 --> 04:23:02,540
Boomi. Good boy. Good boy. I'm not being mean. I'm praising him. He's stinky.

2176
04:23:04,300 --> 04:23:06,300
He likes his nose rubbed. Okay.

2177
04:23:06,860 --> 04:23:18,460
Where is that? I forget which thing it is. Maybe is that why I had this checked off?

2178
04:23:19,820 --> 04:23:25,100
Is that the cave that you get to the mines for that one?

2179
04:23:27,660 --> 04:23:31,980
Boomi don't need. Boomi's trying to hit the light switch. Can you not?

2180
04:23:32,860 --> 04:23:36,620
Boomi, the people want to see you. Come lay back down.

2181
04:23:38,220 --> 04:23:49,660
Good boy. Oh my gosh. What are you eating in there? Lay down. Thank you. Good boy.

2182
04:23:49,820 --> 04:23:51,820
Boomi.

2183
04:23:59,980 --> 04:24:03,180
Wendell Ash. You need the lifer in plus two. No.

2184
04:24:09,500 --> 04:24:15,100
Southwest of it. Oh, it says in Dragons Barrel. Over here.

2185
04:24:19,660 --> 04:24:23,100
Or this one. There's a lot of towers.

2186
04:24:27,740 --> 04:24:33,980
Oh, it's the falling Starbeast cave. Oh, Dragon Barrel has a memory stone. Where?

2187
04:24:36,220 --> 04:24:41,260
Southeast. Over here. And this thing.

2188
04:24:49,900 --> 04:24:52,700
Yeah. Okay. Stop.

2189
04:24:57,980 --> 04:25:04,780
I'll get the memory stone. It's always good to have more memory.

2190
04:25:07,900 --> 04:25:08,540
A little bit.

2191
04:25:15,420 --> 04:25:16,380
That's not the way.

2192
04:25:20,620 --> 04:25:22,780
Well, I'll just run past the dragon.

2193
04:25:35,820 --> 04:25:42,780
You should shave your boobus. So I'm going to save your hand.

2194
04:25:50,060 --> 04:26:03,020
Good night. Who knows? Who knows if I even get to mow? To be honest with you.

2195
04:26:04,860 --> 04:26:08,060
Since I just delay. I have to go shopping.

2196
04:26:11,500 --> 04:26:15,020
Pick it up. Not even worth it.

2197
04:26:15,580 --> 04:26:27,580
Perhaps. Maybe I lied. Oh, is this where the Knight Rider dude is?

2198
04:26:34,780 --> 04:26:39,180
Good night. I might actually kill him.

2199
04:26:39,180 --> 04:26:45,740
No high burps. So I can get his rooms.

2200
04:26:54,860 --> 04:26:59,740
Because I remember trying to cheese him a bunch over here. I can't even remember what the cheese was.

2201
04:26:59,980 --> 04:27:16,300
Yeah, he crossed a bridge. What are you not there now?

2202
04:27:19,980 --> 04:27:26,220
Yes. I think I let you like stand. I remember like jumping over the edge a bunch for some reason.

2203
04:27:26,540 --> 04:27:32,620
Yeah, you make them jump off the bridge. That's what it is. Did they patch that?

2204
04:27:36,940 --> 04:27:43,340
Or you lead them through here. I remember doing that. I'm just rocking over everything. It's fine.

2205
04:27:48,060 --> 04:27:52,620
Where is the entrance? I hate these little dudes. They just look like little monkeys.

2206
04:27:57,020 --> 04:28:01,340
I need a what?

2207
04:28:08,860 --> 04:28:12,860
Use that string string and open balcony to get into the tower. Oh.

2208
04:28:18,780 --> 04:28:22,140
Yeah, I remember trying to do poison build up on him with the boluses.

2209
04:28:27,180 --> 04:28:29,980
I never get you're not supposed to go down the path to avoid them.

2210
04:28:33,020 --> 04:28:34,780
I feel like there's more poison boluses.

2211
04:28:37,420 --> 04:28:41,180
Where are we going? Maybe I just want to go on an adventure. Did you ever think about that?

2212
04:28:44,060 --> 04:28:46,540
Maybe I just want to travel. Maybe I want to see the world.

2213
04:28:46,540 --> 04:28:55,260
Wait, why did I do that?

2214
04:29:09,260 --> 04:29:11,260
Okay.

2215
04:29:17,020 --> 04:29:25,260
Why do I get to the freaking thingy?

2216
04:29:29,980 --> 04:29:32,620
Let's go. Jumping.

2217
04:29:36,780 --> 04:29:41,980
It'd be funny if I died and I just didn't notice. I'm not gonna bother healing. Oh, you know what I could do?

2218
04:29:47,260 --> 04:29:52,620
I'm gonna break into this room. That's what I'm gonna do.

2219
04:29:55,340 --> 04:30:02,380
Got on a roof and slide down. Where's the what? To what balcony though? I can't see it. I made it.

2220
04:30:04,780 --> 04:30:07,740
What? Where's the balcony at? Is it that one? Over there?

2221
04:30:08,540 --> 04:30:10,540
What?

2222
04:30:14,140 --> 04:30:16,220
Bye-bye. Everybody going to bed.

2223
04:30:18,940 --> 04:30:22,540
Wow. To the building. To the walls.

2224
04:30:23,740 --> 04:30:31,260
That's right. I thought I saw it on this side. No? To this side? Yes. Goodbye torrent.

2225
04:30:31,980 --> 04:30:36,780
Wow. I'm breaking. Oh.

2226
04:30:40,860 --> 04:30:42,700
I noticed at the last second.

2227
04:30:47,660 --> 04:30:51,420
I literally said, oh, it'd be funny if I died because I'm not paying attention.

2228
04:30:55,180 --> 04:30:56,380
Oh, that's really good.

2229
04:30:57,020 --> 04:31:03,980
And then I literally saw the sliver of Halsa had left and then I tried to do it and then

2230
04:31:06,300 --> 04:31:15,180
Sheepy, why? Did I ever say it was good at video games? No. Why is myself up here instead of in the rise?

2231
04:31:16,220 --> 04:31:23,020
That's weird. All right. Anyways, so I started Blast. Hello. It's Boopy.

2232
04:31:23,020 --> 04:31:29,180
It would be a shame if somebody destroyed everything in this room. That'd be so terrible.

2233
04:31:30,140 --> 04:31:33,980
Such a travesty. How dare they, you know?

2234
04:31:41,740 --> 04:31:50,460
What the? What is that? I'm assuming this won't work on it. What?

2235
04:31:53,820 --> 04:31:58,940
All right. I'm kind of scared.

2236
04:32:03,740 --> 04:32:07,420
Oh, it's like a bunch of them. How am I supposed to kill this thing?

2237
04:32:09,420 --> 04:32:11,340
I need to do blood build. That's what I need to do.

2238
04:32:13,420 --> 04:32:16,300
I don't have any stamina. Let me go away first again.

2239
04:32:16,300 --> 04:32:25,020
Pardon me to drive these babies for miles.

2240
04:32:30,300 --> 04:32:36,700
Are you meant to like cheat your way in here like by doing that? Because I think I remember

2241
04:32:36,700 --> 04:32:43,740
I specifically went to get the thing. All right. I don't care about whatever it's attacking me with.

2242
04:32:46,540 --> 04:32:51,260
Wow. Oh, I like knocked it down.

2243
04:32:53,820 --> 04:32:55,020
Well, I'm not locked on.

2244
04:33:03,020 --> 04:33:07,260
I hate that. It's like an amalgamation of, oh, oh, oh my god, the hell?

2245
04:33:08,700 --> 04:33:12,540
Of all like the sorcerers, it's like really freaked up.

2246
04:33:16,940 --> 04:33:30,300
I didn't even have to kill you. There's nothing in here. Brother, what? I was wasting my time.

2247
04:33:38,380 --> 04:33:41,100
Maybe I just needed to kill that amalgamation. Okay.

2248
04:33:41,740 --> 04:33:49,260
Yeah, I know that happens to Selen. It's very depressing. I never finished Selen's quest.

2249
04:33:49,260 --> 04:33:50,220
I remember reading that.

2250
04:33:55,340 --> 04:33:57,420
That's me for the fun of it.

2251
04:33:58,380 --> 04:33:59,740
I need you to think of it.

2252
04:34:03,740 --> 04:34:05,740
Be by marching.

2253
04:34:16,300 --> 04:34:17,580
Oh, memories.

2254
04:34:20,620 --> 04:34:24,540
America, y'all America, y'all.

2255
04:34:25,340 --> 04:34:31,260
Oh, yeah. Where was the other place I have to go?

2256
04:34:34,620 --> 04:34:39,420
For the ball bearings?

2257
04:34:41,340 --> 04:34:41,660
Hello.

2258
04:34:41,980 --> 04:34:55,660
Honestly, I should go to Selen for glint stone sorceries.

2259
04:34:58,620 --> 04:35:03,100
I realized that when I was watching stuff that I should have gone to her and done her quest.

2260
04:35:03,420 --> 04:35:10,140
My bed.

2261
04:35:14,700 --> 04:35:18,620
That was cheesy as fuck. I mean, it's frick. Now you're gone.

2262
04:35:19,740 --> 04:35:26,140
Now you've been yeeted just because you're a terrible joke. I'm not mad. I'm disappointed.

2263
04:35:26,140 --> 04:35:26,940
You could have done better.

2264
04:35:28,300 --> 04:35:30,540
Which bell bearing? Ah, the one for the somber stones.

2265
04:35:30,540 --> 04:35:34,700
I forgot where the crystal girly pops are.

2266
04:35:38,780 --> 04:35:42,300
No, I'm going to kill, if I kill Mogue, will I still be able to do a quest? I'm assuming yes.

2267
04:35:42,940 --> 04:35:46,140
Oh my god, Reina. Oh my god, Reina. No, Reina. Reina.

2268
04:35:50,060 --> 04:35:55,420
Oh my god. Reina. Reina is climbing all over me.

2269
04:35:55,980 --> 04:36:00,940
Hi. I'm so proud of you for catching that ball, Reina. Wow.

2270
04:36:03,260 --> 04:36:06,780
My big mama still providing for me after all these years.

2271
04:36:11,580 --> 04:36:14,300
I'd show you her, but she's like on my shoulder right now.

2272
04:36:14,620 --> 04:36:32,620
She's purring. Let me get her some. I don't know if they'll be able to hear it over the room.

2273
04:36:33,020 --> 04:36:46,940
Okay, I just need, I just need the eighth stone. That's all I want.

2274
04:36:46,940 --> 04:36:55,260
Okay.

2275
04:36:56,380 --> 04:36:57,820
A cellulia crystal cave?

2276
04:37:03,980 --> 04:37:09,740
What? Tau? There's multiple Tau. Oh, this here, this Tau or that Tau? You got to be more specific.

2277
04:37:09,740 --> 04:37:15,260
I'm a dumb. I'm a dumb dumb.

2278
04:37:17,900 --> 04:37:21,260
The divine tower? The Esma?

2279
04:37:27,020 --> 04:37:31,260
What that? Is that where it is? Is that the S?

2280
04:37:31,500 --> 04:37:45,580
Is that it? The music just skipped there. Okay, Reina. I can't have you like that.

2281
04:37:45,580 --> 04:38:01,900
This one? You guys just got to give like the cardinal directions.

2282
04:38:09,100 --> 04:38:13,260
You're a patient? What does that mean? Oh, perishing.

2283
04:38:16,540 --> 04:38:18,700
Okay, I suppose we go then.

2284
04:38:21,500 --> 04:38:25,820
Ah, Reina just sat on my controller. Ah, okay, she just jumped down.

2285
04:38:29,180 --> 04:38:34,060
Oh, what should be the fastest? I don't have any graces up here because I never went up here.

2286
04:38:36,220 --> 04:38:39,900
Because I know there's like a race up there where you can fight the invader person.

2287
04:38:46,300 --> 04:38:48,300
Oh.

2288
04:39:01,020 --> 04:39:02,860
Sounds like there's always a swarm of bees.

2289
04:39:08,700 --> 04:39:13,100
It's funny that this wall doesn't hurt you. It always confused me a little bit.

2290
04:39:13,900 --> 04:39:16,620
I feel like the wall should be able to hurt you when you get too close.

2291
04:39:24,700 --> 04:39:27,100
Not the bees!

2292
04:39:29,020 --> 04:39:32,780
Oh yeah, I hate this divine tower because I remember falling off at it a bit,

2293
04:39:32,780 --> 04:39:38,540
a bunch. Getting knocked off from the ladders and stuff. Little perches.

2294
04:39:43,260 --> 04:39:49,580
Hi, I know you like this, whatever it is.

2295
04:39:59,580 --> 04:40:03,100
I'm coming for you. Yeah.

2296
04:40:08,620 --> 04:40:10,620
Oh.

2297
04:40:13,980 --> 04:40:24,700
Hi. Hi, welcome to Applebees. Would you like the apples or bees?

2298
04:40:26,220 --> 04:40:30,140
We're actually out of apples, so all we have is bees. Would you like the bees?

2299
04:40:31,580 --> 04:40:34,620
The bees need them.

2300
04:40:35,500 --> 04:40:51,740
I literally saw you like 15 minutes ago. I got a pee. I got a pee.

2301
04:40:55,980 --> 04:41:01,500
Yep, I could actually level this up too. I swear I have four.

2302
04:41:05,420 --> 04:41:14,140
Wait, what do I need for that actually? I wasn't paying attention. Maybe I'm thinking

2303
04:41:14,140 --> 04:41:25,100
of a smithing stone for. I could have sworn I have a three. It doesn't matter. I can just go to

2304
04:41:25,100 --> 04:41:41,900
EG for that. Oh, Lord Beesbury, Beesbury, Mac and Bees. He has selected the bees,

2305
04:41:42,620 --> 04:41:48,060
released the bees, and the whole place just like goes insane because somebody ordered bees.

2306
04:41:55,340 --> 04:42:01,500
I feel like do I have a four?

2307
04:42:05,820 --> 04:42:11,340
Thought I had a four, I guess I don't. I know I don't have a five. I know I have a five, six,

2308
04:42:11,340 --> 04:42:12,540
I have a six and a seven.

2309
04:42:16,460 --> 04:42:17,260
I don't know why I did that.

2310
04:42:17,260 --> 04:42:27,500
I had a four. I said I didn't have any stored. Oh wait, stored, whatever.

2311
04:42:30,460 --> 04:42:36,940
Next time, this time I'll make you fire for that. What do you mean? I already fought for my life.

2312
04:42:39,020 --> 04:42:44,860
Do you want me to die again? Because of ice cream, my lactose and taller pants?

2313
04:42:47,340 --> 04:42:57,900
I almost died. I almost, I almost was not long for this earth.

2314
04:43:05,020 --> 04:43:14,460
Who's the nun? None of your business, so long as I have lactate. I just didn't eat it.

2315
04:43:18,220 --> 04:43:18,620
Yeah.

2316
04:43:21,260 --> 04:43:25,260
No, don't die pretty late. You're so hot. Don't die.

2317
04:43:27,580 --> 04:43:34,060
I like that meme of where like there's like, they replace the sword with the player model

2318
04:43:34,060 --> 04:43:39,980
T posing and he's just smacking the Bible. He's just smacking it.

2319
04:43:43,820 --> 04:43:52,300
What? What's the matter? Don't look at me like that. What do you mean? Stop it.

2320
04:43:56,460 --> 04:44:01,420
There's a quick port. Well, I like to do the long way, which is go all the way to the bottom corner.

2321
04:44:04,700 --> 04:44:09,020
Reach out and touch grace.

2322
04:44:15,260 --> 04:44:17,580
Roderico, why are you making weird noises in my ear?

2323
04:44:19,420 --> 04:44:26,460
This is a good up. Just look it up. Google it. Just Google it. I feel like I should pee before this

2324
04:44:26,460 --> 04:44:38,220
battle. See, it's Eldon John, but I believe it is. He wasn't an Eldon Lord, I believe he was.

2325
04:44:39,020 --> 04:44:44,220
I bet he was part of a prophet, but it's so interesting like why are they worshiping him then,

2326
04:44:44,220 --> 04:44:49,500
you know? Why are you? Why are you?

2327
04:44:52,860 --> 04:44:57,340
I'm confused. Ow, I'm going to die.

2328
04:45:01,260 --> 04:45:05,740
How could this happen? Wait, where do I go? Wait, how do I get to Mogue again?

2329
04:45:14,220 --> 04:45:21,100
Torret, come down here right now. Yeah, elevator, because I'm like, wait, hold on,

2330
04:45:21,100 --> 04:45:30,380
let me get my runey poons, my poon, my poom poom. Actually, I might kill all of them just to get the runes.

2331
04:45:33,020 --> 04:45:40,860
Oh, no, no, no. Oh, I forgot there's a chest over here. Hold on, just a moment. I'll be with you momentarily.

2332
04:45:44,220 --> 04:46:03,740
That doesn't really do much. What about... ow, ow.

2333
04:46:03,740 --> 04:46:15,900
Ow. Ow. Oh, what's this?

2334
04:46:20,140 --> 04:46:24,940
Sweet. Wait, I really just actually already have the runes.

2335
04:46:25,900 --> 04:46:33,980
Oh, get down from there. Ow. Why am I not? Oh, I'm pressing the wrong button, that's why.

2336
04:46:36,300 --> 04:46:36,940
No, I'm out.

2337
04:46:44,300 --> 04:46:45,740
Now I'm going to kill you because I'm angry.

2338
04:46:46,460 --> 04:46:51,020
Guys are abominations to nature.

2339
04:46:54,060 --> 04:46:59,580
Oh, I'm out of FP. I'm out of puh. I'm out of puh puh.

2340
04:47:04,060 --> 04:47:09,580
I don't know I'm doing that, but, you know, oh, that doesn't work. I almost fell off this cliff.

2341
04:47:10,140 --> 04:47:11,100
Ow, that would have been awkward.

2342
04:47:16,780 --> 04:47:24,060
Yeah, get over here. I'm going to knock you off. Yeah. Oh, I'm going to die. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2343
04:47:27,900 --> 04:47:28,540
I don't know.

2344
04:47:28,540 --> 04:47:41,740
I'm here to kill you. Why are you guys being so aggressive?

2345
04:47:41,740 --> 04:47:47,580
Okay, hold on. I'm just going to get my runes. Just going to get them.

2346
04:47:47,900 --> 04:47:54,940
You killed Lenny.

2347
04:47:57,180 --> 04:48:00,860
Oi. We got to kill Homelander.

2348
04:48:03,020 --> 04:48:07,980
Okay, I hear somebody next to me. I think I'm fine.

2349
04:48:10,620 --> 04:48:15,580
No, I'm not. No, I'm not. I'm not fine at all. I'm just going to leave.

2350
04:48:18,060 --> 04:48:28,860
Oh, why are you chasing? Oh, I almost jumped off the cliff. No.

2351
04:48:38,860 --> 04:48:40,860
Is that bully, Billy Butcher?

2352
04:48:43,020 --> 04:48:45,740
No, the healing is lava.

2353
04:48:47,660 --> 04:48:50,860
What is he going to do? Oh, yeah.

2354
04:49:09,500 --> 04:49:12,860
Yippee.

2355
04:49:18,300 --> 04:49:19,660
I don't think this is going to be enough.

2356
04:49:22,220 --> 04:49:25,660
No, I will have to kill them. I'll have to end them.

2357
04:49:28,860 --> 04:49:31,180
I must do what I must.

2358
04:49:35,100 --> 04:49:42,860
Bumi, what are you looking at? You're staring at the door and it's freaking me out.

2359
04:49:43,740 --> 04:49:53,020
Time to stand. Shut up, Alpha Watch. I don't need to stand. I won't stand.

2360
04:49:53,660 --> 04:49:56,140
I can't stand. You're asking me to stand.

2361
04:49:57,580 --> 04:50:04,140
Stand. I actually need to change my physics while I'm at it.

2362
04:50:04,940 --> 04:50:19,820
Um, I'm going to do the magic shrouding and do it to the purified crystal.

2363
04:50:24,620 --> 04:50:29,260
I wish you could have more than like, if you could have three for the physics, that'd be sick.

2364
04:50:30,140 --> 04:50:33,340
Um, blood for the blood god.

2365
04:50:36,300 --> 04:50:39,180
I'm just going to try to aggro one of you because I think that's all I need.

2366
04:50:43,820 --> 04:50:45,500
Oh, oh, you have a shield up. That's why.

2367
04:50:48,140 --> 04:50:53,980
He's going to creep towards me. Do they have silver tier shields? I just realized. Oh, no, they don't.

2368
04:50:54,380 --> 04:50:59,420
Oh, no, not the freaking.

2369
04:51:02,460 --> 04:51:04,860
Oh, oh, there you go.

2370
04:51:07,180 --> 04:51:13,580
It's not enough. How much do I need? I need 16k more.

2371
04:51:14,220 --> 04:51:25,900
I'm just going to aggro one at a time. Oh, uh, I don't think that aggro them one at a time.

2372
04:51:29,980 --> 04:51:34,140
I'd like to think it didn't aggro them one at a time.

2373
04:51:34,140 --> 04:51:51,020
I'm too far away. Oh, no, I'm not. Oh, I should be able to kill you.

2374
04:52:04,220 --> 04:52:07,900
Good stuff. Okay, thank you. Much appreciate.

2375
04:52:15,500 --> 04:52:20,620
Uh, no, I didn't have any rooms left. That's why I wanted to heal. Damn.

2376
04:52:25,580 --> 04:52:25,820
What?

2377
04:52:28,300 --> 04:52:31,980
Am I tripping? I thought it said 120. How many rooms do I have?

2378
04:52:35,100 --> 04:52:41,980
Oh, I apparently went to Sexic for a moment. I thought it said 121.

2379
04:52:43,180 --> 04:52:47,100
Hey, come back here. You. I'm going to aggro you.

2380
04:52:49,340 --> 04:52:53,020
How do I just aggro you? No, not you. No, not you.

2381
04:52:55,900 --> 04:52:59,500
Oh, oh, God. Oh, oh, uh, hold on. Let me just

2382
04:52:59,500 --> 04:53:03,180
just hold on just a moment.

2383
04:53:12,540 --> 04:53:18,860
Oh, you're going to kill me. Oh, blood build up. No, that's fine. I died close to.

2384
04:53:18,860 --> 04:53:28,380
Oh, they're like, yeah, you got him, boss. You got him.

2385
04:53:29,580 --> 04:53:33,580
Is the movie a plus 10? No, it did. I don't have an ancient dragon stone.

2386
04:53:33,660 --> 04:53:53,020
Perhaps a different approach. I prefer this approach. I think this is a good approach.

2387
04:53:54,860 --> 04:54:01,580
Yeah, come around town, brother. Come on around the corner, brother. Oh, never mind. You can jump.

2388
04:54:01,580 --> 04:54:09,420
This is awkward as hell. Well, well, that was a cool little spin you did. I'm just going to

2389
04:54:09,420 --> 04:54:16,700
spam my RB. Oh, you just totally freaking destroyed me. I didn't think I could be repost.

2390
04:54:16,700 --> 04:54:20,860
That was pretty bad ass, though, brother, to be honest with you. I'll be like real,

2391
04:54:20,860 --> 04:54:24,940
real, real true to you right now. I respect you for that. I respect you.

2392
04:54:25,900 --> 04:54:32,540
A hardcore for what you just did there. It was very impressive. I don't think that I've ever

2393
04:54:32,540 --> 04:54:38,700
seen anybody do it like you can. And I bet your mama is real proud of you because a lot of people

2394
04:54:38,700 --> 04:54:43,260
wouldn't be able to do that to me and you were able to do that to me. And so I think you're pretty

2395
04:54:43,260 --> 04:54:49,500
neat, I suppose. But I'm going to have to kill you. I'm really sorry. I hope I hope you don't

2396
04:54:49,500 --> 04:54:55,660
really take it as like a misunderstanding. But I am going to have to end your life. So if you can

2397
04:54:55,660 --> 04:55:04,620
hop over the wall, eat this, eat that, get stun locked, that would be, oh, you just parried me

2398
04:55:04,620 --> 04:55:12,780
and you're going to kill me again. I respect you for that. And I just can't believe that

2399
04:55:12,780 --> 04:55:19,900
happened twice, to be honest. I didn't know that he could parry. And I'm kind of disappointed

2400
04:55:20,780 --> 04:55:27,500
that MPC can parry me perfectly each time. I don't think that's really fair. I think that's a broken

2401
04:55:27,500 --> 04:55:34,460
game mechanic. I think FromSoft should fix their games because that's just disrespectful. I shouldn't

2402
04:55:34,540 --> 04:55:42,940
be having to fight against the AI, the AI are taking over and they're selling all of our data to

2403
04:55:42,940 --> 04:55:48,220
other countries. And I just don't think that's real nice of them. And the fact that they're using the

2404
04:55:48,220 --> 04:55:53,820
same AI and FromSoft games is just kind of sad. And I'm going to be out of FP in a moment, but

2405
04:55:53,820 --> 04:55:59,500
that's all right. I don't need FP where we're going. He just threw a knife at me and I'm going to stab

2406
04:55:59,500 --> 04:56:05,100
him, but he's probably going to parry me. Nope, he couldn't parry me. It's fine. That's real cool.

2407
04:56:05,100 --> 04:56:10,700
I'm happy we could talk. And I'm happy we could have this conversation. And I literally just ended

2408
04:56:10,700 --> 04:56:18,860
up with no FP. Sorry, FP. I apologize for making that mistake. I meant to say FP. I really got a

2409
04:56:18,860 --> 04:56:26,540
pay pay. That's for sure. I'm going to level up now. I'm going to put it into Vigor because I

2410
04:56:26,540 --> 04:56:33,500
definitely need more Vigor because I need to, I want to be at least like I like 60. I don't know

2411
04:56:33,500 --> 04:56:43,420
how many runes that a mogwin is going to give me, but that's fine. It's co or what the shibbity. I'm

2412
04:56:43,420 --> 04:56:48,300
going to go down this elevator and we're going to see what happens next. Okay, wait, I got a pay first.

2413
04:56:48,300 --> 04:56:53,740
I really think I should pay first. Should I pay first or should I, should I try to fight him while

2414
04:56:53,740 --> 04:57:00,860
holding my pay? I'm not quite sure. I don't know if it'll be distracting.

2415
04:57:05,900 --> 04:57:08,540
It has a somber for the weight. Does it have the agent dragon stone?

2416
04:57:09,980 --> 04:57:15,260
What? Hold on a moment. Hold on a moment there.

2417
04:57:16,220 --> 04:57:24,700
Oh, it do. I'm going to get out here real quick. It was real nice hanging out with y'all. Thank you

2418
04:57:24,700 --> 04:57:30,220
for getting me what I needed. I'm going to go sit down at this grace. I totally forgot that that

2419
04:57:30,220 --> 04:57:35,180
was in there. I'm going to go to the round table real quick. I can't do it because I'm aggroed

2420
04:57:35,180 --> 04:57:38,860
right now, but I'm going to sit down and de-aggro y'all. So it's been really nice.

2421
04:57:38,940 --> 04:57:48,780
Let me just pop on over. I think the moon veil was a great choice to be honest with you. So thank

2422
04:57:48,780 --> 04:57:58,540
you y'all for recommending me that. I really got to, you want me to, of course, of course,

2423
04:57:58,540 --> 04:58:04,300
the pin pals is a piss on him. I don't know if that would be effective. Well, we could try it.

2424
04:58:05,020 --> 04:58:10,380
Uh, I could try spraying all over him. I never knew. I don't know. Maybe it's acidic enough.

2425
04:58:10,380 --> 04:58:18,220
Maybe my pH balance is high enough that I could kill him with my, with my acidic pee.

2426
04:58:21,100 --> 04:58:22,300
Very spicy.

2427
04:58:23,180 --> 04:58:34,380
Wow. We did it y'all. We did it. Yeah. I see mo. We did it.

2428
04:58:35,740 --> 04:58:40,860
We killed the dude and when we got the dragon stone, we did it. We did it. We did it. Yeah.

2429
04:58:42,860 --> 04:58:45,820
Well, don't you think water, uh, debatable.

2430
04:58:46,380 --> 04:58:53,740
DLC is a cooler moon veil, but yeah, I want, but I wanted to go into the DLC with a cool weapon.

2431
04:58:55,260 --> 04:58:59,340
You know, I look kind of, I look pretty cool right now. If I do say so myself,

2432
04:58:59,340 --> 04:59:04,380
look at this, look at this pose. Ready? Boom. How's that make you feel? You're staring at greatness

2433
04:59:04,380 --> 04:59:09,260
right there. I saw I'm going to say you're staring at greatness. You're looking at the future.

2434
04:59:09,980 --> 04:59:14,780
You're looking at a future US military soldier right here. That's all I'm saying.

2435
04:59:15,820 --> 04:59:22,780
You're looking at a future military golden order soldier America and right again.

2436
04:59:24,380 --> 04:59:27,580
So you better put some respect on my name to be honest with you.

2437
04:59:32,700 --> 04:59:35,580
And you know what? This is America's ass.

2438
04:59:45,820 --> 04:59:49,900
What'd you say? You're trying to, you're trying to step up? Nah.

2439
04:59:52,860 --> 04:59:56,940
Oh, that's my cat food going off. I got to feed my cat.

2440
05:00:01,020 --> 05:00:09,660
I'm a goddamn marine. Okay, let me feed Fia. It's going to take me a little bit longer to feed Fia

2441
05:00:09,660 --> 05:00:15,420
because she's very weak right now. So I literally have to like spoon feed her stuff and down her

2442
05:00:15,420 --> 05:00:20,940
mouth because she it's hard. She can't really lick that well or swole while she can swallow but

2443
05:00:23,180 --> 05:00:30,460
she can't really like chew anything. So I literally have like I took a little plastic bag. I cut a

2444
05:00:31,820 --> 05:00:38,060
hole in one of the edges so I could like pipe pipe at like food into her mouth.

2445
05:00:38,460 --> 05:00:45,340
I was going to turn it but I'll talk and stuff so you guys can

2446
05:00:51,500 --> 05:01:00,460
See y'all. Hi, Miam. You look so cozy in bed right now. I'm going to ruin that.

2447
05:01:08,860 --> 05:01:10,460
I don't think I'm going to do it.

2448
05:01:21,020 --> 05:01:26,300
You might hear Fia speak because she doesn't want to be moved but she's not in pain or anything.

2449
05:01:28,220 --> 05:01:33,100
Oh, let's see. I need to give you your medication.

2450
05:01:38,060 --> 05:01:57,100
Okay?

2451
05:01:57,100 --> 05:02:05,020
Oh, da-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.

2452
05:02:06,720 --> 05:02:08,200
Be good for jowls.

2453
05:02:09,720 --> 05:02:12,700
Because sometimes, if you make a little mess,

2454
05:02:13,340 --> 05:02:15,120
because I miss his or my,

2455
05:02:19,080 --> 05:02:22,200
I'm actually gonna follow you after you know, do that.

2456
05:02:22,200 --> 05:02:48,800
for you baby yeah thank you I appreciate you guys yeah it's pretty tough because I I've

2457
05:02:48,800 --> 05:02:52,560
never had to feed her by hand before but the doctor said this is the weakest

2458
05:02:52,560 --> 05:03:03,640
um she's ever seen her don't know why but you know I will do whatever it takes to keep

2459
05:03:03,640 --> 05:03:09,600
her going because she's not really motivated to eat right now because it's very hard for her to

2460
05:03:09,600 --> 05:03:16,920
I don't blame her that she's so tired that I can't eat anything

2461
05:03:40,560 --> 05:03:49,880
so what I do I trick her and so I took a little churu thing and I pipe it full of

2462
05:03:49,880 --> 05:03:55,640
her food and she thinks she's eating a churu because she refuses to eat otherwise I don't know

2463
05:03:55,640 --> 05:04:07,640
why it's very funny that's why I ordered more churus because I realize it's easier for her

2464
05:04:07,640 --> 05:04:24,920
not that I just can't I can't feed her off a churus but it does motivate her to eat a little bit

2465
05:04:24,920 --> 05:04:42,680
bitch gotcha don't even know what happened to you don't even know what happened to you did

2466
05:04:42,680 --> 05:04:47,640
you see coming put some more strength on my navel

2467
05:05:12,680 --> 05:05:21,600
the facts are like swarming me like vultures when we're trying to get the wet food

2468
05:05:42,680 --> 05:05:44,680
you

2469
05:06:12,680 --> 05:06:14,680
you

2470
05:06:42,680 --> 05:06:44,680
I

2471
05:06:48,280 --> 05:06:50,280
want to accidentally give her like

2472
05:06:56,440 --> 05:07:03,520
I don't actually get via free freeze because it's it was in the fridge and literally have

2473
05:07:03,520 --> 05:07:05,520
a plastic bag

2474
05:07:33,520 --> 05:07:35,520
you

2475
05:08:03,520 --> 05:08:05,520
you

2476
05:08:34,160 --> 05:08:36,160
you

2477
05:08:56,280 --> 05:09:00,000
but I'm glad I found a way to eat her because I was like

2478
05:09:03,520 --> 05:09:05,520
I can't do that.

2479
05:09:05,520 --> 05:09:09,520
I'm just moving your head so you don't have to wash your face.

2480
05:09:14,520 --> 05:09:16,520
I'm just going to have to wash my face.

2481
05:09:18,520 --> 05:09:20,520
All right, ladies.

2482
05:09:26,520 --> 05:09:28,520
I don't know.

2483
05:09:28,520 --> 05:09:30,520
I don't know. I don't know.

2484
05:09:30,520 --> 05:09:32,520
I don't know.

2485
05:09:32,520 --> 05:09:34,520
I don't know.

2486
05:09:34,520 --> 05:10:03,520
This is also the way to get her liquid because I was having to try to use a syringe to get liquid into her mouth.

2487
05:10:03,520 --> 05:10:10,520
It's actually difficult, so I just mix a lot of wet food with a lot of water until she's getting her liquid and she's getting her food.

2488
05:10:10,520 --> 05:10:12,520
It's very effective.

2489
05:10:12,520 --> 05:10:15,520
Even though I just don't like it.

2490
05:10:27,520 --> 05:10:29,520
That's good.

2491
05:10:33,520 --> 05:10:35,520
Good job, P.S.

2492
05:10:35,520 --> 05:10:37,520
I'm sorry.

2493
05:10:37,520 --> 05:10:39,520
I know it's uncomfortable.

2494
05:10:53,520 --> 05:11:01,520
But if she doesn't improve tomorrow with her eating and her strength, she still can't eat by herself.

2495
05:11:01,520 --> 05:11:06,520
I'm going to go over here to the hospital again.

2496
05:11:06,520 --> 05:11:08,520
Just to get a checkup.

2497
05:11:08,520 --> 05:11:12,520
Because it lets us know at a good time, you know.

2498
05:11:14,520 --> 05:11:18,520
But this is a very effective way of feeding her.

2499
05:11:18,520 --> 05:11:21,520
Yeah, we can have a walk over this one.

2500
05:11:21,520 --> 05:11:24,520
I got my hands full of fish.

2501
05:11:24,520 --> 05:11:31,520
I'm going to wash my hands.

2502
05:11:31,520 --> 05:11:33,520
Good.

2503
05:11:48,520 --> 05:11:54,520
Okay, you're going to hear Fia squeak because I'm going to lift her up.

2504
05:11:54,520 --> 05:11:59,520
And I'm going to see if I can get her to use the bathroom because she hasn't used the bathroom all day.

2505
05:11:59,520 --> 05:12:01,520
Come on, baby.

2506
05:12:03,520 --> 05:12:07,520
I know you're totally over me right now.

2507
05:12:13,520 --> 05:12:15,520
Hey, now I'll see you on your face.

2508
05:12:15,520 --> 05:12:17,520
Yeah.

2509
05:12:17,520 --> 05:12:19,520
Yeah.

2510
05:12:19,520 --> 05:12:21,520
No.

2511
05:12:21,520 --> 05:12:23,520
Yeah, I know.

2512
05:12:23,520 --> 05:12:25,520
Just like in the face.

2513
05:12:25,520 --> 05:12:29,520
And then I'm going to put you in the litter box.

2514
05:12:29,520 --> 05:12:33,520
Okay, I'm going to put you in the litter box.

2515
05:12:33,520 --> 05:12:36,520
And you're going to just rest right here.

2516
05:12:46,520 --> 05:12:51,520
And then you can try to go and I'll leave you there for a little bit.

2517
05:12:51,520 --> 05:12:53,520
You can't posture anything.

2518
05:12:53,520 --> 05:12:58,520
So I literally just have to put her in the litter box and like proper upright as well as I can.

2519
05:12:58,520 --> 05:13:01,520
And then hopefully she goes.

2520
05:13:01,520 --> 05:13:04,520
Sometimes she does, sometimes she doesn't.

2521
05:13:11,520 --> 05:13:15,520
I know you can hear her go, no.

2522
05:13:15,520 --> 05:13:17,520
Yeah.

2523
05:13:17,520 --> 05:13:24,520
Honestly, well, I know Fia's uncomfortable because she's not usually a talkative cat.

2524
05:13:24,520 --> 05:13:29,520
She only talks if she doesn't want something.

2525
05:13:29,520 --> 05:13:35,520
Although no, she actually she'll get really excited when she plays with her toys and she'll like start like yelling, which is funny.

2526
05:13:35,520 --> 05:13:37,520
Just like rain it is.

2527
05:13:37,520 --> 05:13:39,520
It's such a good moment.

2528
05:13:39,520 --> 05:13:41,520
Oh, thank you.

2529
05:13:41,520 --> 05:13:43,520
I try.

2530
05:13:43,520 --> 05:13:53,520
Because like what really makes me sad is that cats with her condition usually get put down because people don't understand that it can be like put in remission and stuff.

2531
05:13:53,520 --> 05:13:57,520
So I'm just trying to give her a good shot at life.

2532
05:13:57,520 --> 05:14:00,520
You know, she's like wiggling.

2533
05:14:00,520 --> 05:14:04,520
She's like, I just feel bad because she can't lift up her head right now.

2534
05:14:04,520 --> 05:14:06,520
Okay.

2535
05:14:13,520 --> 05:14:17,520
I've tried to express her bladder before myself, but it's pretty hard.

2536
05:14:17,520 --> 05:14:22,520
She gets usually pretty loud if I try to do it.

2537
05:14:23,520 --> 05:14:33,520
Yeah, she's my she's my little girl.

2538
05:14:33,520 --> 05:14:35,520
She's only a baby.

2539
05:14:35,520 --> 05:14:37,520
She's just a little baby.

2540
05:14:37,520 --> 05:14:39,520
She's a little kitten.

2541
05:14:39,520 --> 05:14:41,520
Rain is coming over all concerned.

2542
05:14:41,520 --> 05:14:47,520
I'm going to try to wash off the bed while you were in there.

2543
05:14:47,520 --> 05:14:57,520
And I apologize if the stuff was like depressing or something, but I'm just kind of explaining my process and just not like she will get better.

2544
05:14:57,520 --> 05:14:59,520
It just takes a long time.

2545
05:14:59,520 --> 05:15:04,520
Like I might take like two or three weeks for her to completely recover.

2546
05:15:04,520 --> 05:15:07,520
So don't think like she's just like stuff like this forever.

2547
05:15:07,520 --> 05:15:08,520
She's not.

2548
05:15:08,520 --> 05:15:11,520
I've been through this before with her.

2549
05:15:11,520 --> 05:15:14,520
It took her like a month to get better and she's tough.

2550
05:15:14,520 --> 05:15:18,520
And it's like a it's like rounds of steroids and other stuff.

2551
05:15:18,520 --> 05:15:21,520
And then usually she'll do okay.

2552
05:15:44,520 --> 05:15:46,520
Yeah.

2553
05:16:14,520 --> 05:16:31,520
I washed her back the best I could, but it's a very fuzzy bed.

2554
05:16:31,520 --> 05:16:35,520
So it's been a great movie.

2555
05:16:35,520 --> 05:16:40,520
You can share it with some friends or something like that.

2556
05:16:40,520 --> 05:16:44,520
I'm not sure how to try that with.

2557
05:16:44,520 --> 05:16:56,520
Be good.

2558
05:16:56,520 --> 05:16:58,520
Did you go?

2559
05:16:58,520 --> 05:17:13,520
I think with this condition, it's not like she can't pee.

2560
05:17:13,520 --> 05:17:15,520
It's like you can't posture.

2561
05:17:15,520 --> 05:17:24,520
And when a cat can't posture and they use a bathroom, they'll sometimes hold it, which can cause an infection, which is why I also I also give her like an antibiotic.

2562
05:17:24,520 --> 05:17:33,520
I'm going to get like a UTI, a little water infection.

2563
05:17:33,520 --> 05:17:38,520
Make sure I'm going to have to give her that right now.

2564
05:17:38,520 --> 05:17:42,520
I forgot to give her that medication antibiotic.

2565
05:17:42,520 --> 05:17:46,520
I'll do that after she gets a lot of water blocks.

2566
05:17:46,520 --> 05:17:52,520
I'm going to put her just in my little big bunniness that you guys saw me put together.

2567
05:17:52,520 --> 05:17:55,520
I sleep with her in that.

2568
05:17:55,520 --> 05:17:59,520
Something we just did with my father.

2569
05:17:59,520 --> 05:18:02,520
I pop her up usually super like in a bed with me in there.

2570
05:18:02,520 --> 05:18:04,520
She's just enough to roll around.

2571
05:18:04,520 --> 05:18:06,520
Hi Bea.

2572
05:18:06,520 --> 05:18:08,520
Are you done?

2573
05:18:08,520 --> 05:18:10,520
Did you go?

2574
05:18:10,520 --> 05:18:12,520
Did you go?

2575
05:18:12,520 --> 05:18:14,520
I didn't go.

2576
05:18:14,520 --> 05:18:16,520
I need to try.

2577
05:18:16,520 --> 05:18:18,520
Yeah.

2578
05:18:18,520 --> 05:18:20,520
I need to try to do it.

2579
05:18:20,520 --> 05:18:22,520
I don't want to go with her.

2580
05:18:24,520 --> 05:18:26,520
She took a bun.

2581
05:18:26,520 --> 05:18:28,520
She took a bun. She took a bun.

2582
05:18:28,520 --> 05:18:30,520
Oh, you're so good.

2583
05:18:30,520 --> 05:18:32,520
She took a bun.

2584
05:18:32,520 --> 05:18:34,520
You can't do this with your right hand.

2585
05:18:34,520 --> 05:18:36,520
The angle of that hand.

2586
05:18:36,520 --> 05:18:38,520
All right.

2587
05:18:38,520 --> 05:18:40,520
She's sleeping right after you guys.

2588
05:18:40,520 --> 05:18:42,520
But there you go.

2589
05:18:42,520 --> 05:18:44,520
You can chill a little.

2590
05:18:44,520 --> 05:18:46,520
I'm going to grab your pillow real quick.

2591
05:18:50,520 --> 05:18:53,520
Usually I would give her a treat every time she takes her pillow.

2592
05:18:53,520 --> 05:18:56,520
But because she can't chew, she doesn't want to strengthen her jaw.

2593
05:18:58,520 --> 05:19:00,520
I need to give her a treat and stuff.

2594
05:19:00,520 --> 05:19:02,520
Hello.

2595
05:19:02,520 --> 05:19:04,520
Hi.

2596
05:19:04,520 --> 05:19:06,520
Oh, you're so good.

2597
05:19:06,520 --> 05:19:08,520
You're so good.

2598
05:19:08,520 --> 05:19:10,520
I can't leave you alone.

2599
05:19:12,520 --> 05:19:14,520
Okay, now I have to pee.

2600
05:19:26,520 --> 05:19:28,520
I love to pee with some pets.

2601
05:19:28,520 --> 05:19:30,520
Yeah, she snuggled up right next to you.

2602
05:19:30,520 --> 05:19:32,520
She's actually laying using your head.

2603
05:19:32,520 --> 05:19:34,520
I mean, using your foot as a pillow for her head.

2604
05:19:34,520 --> 05:19:36,520
So she's chilling right with the harem.

2605
05:19:36,520 --> 05:19:38,520
And a little funny nest.

2606
05:19:38,520 --> 05:19:40,520
Very cozy.

2607
05:19:42,520 --> 05:19:44,520
I would need to create cats this week.

2608
05:19:44,520 --> 05:19:46,520
I just, it's the bare minimum.

2609
05:19:46,520 --> 05:19:48,520
To be honest with you.

2610
05:19:48,520 --> 05:19:50,520
It's like animals can't really defend themselves.

2611
05:19:50,520 --> 05:19:52,520
Or take care of themselves.

2612
05:19:52,520 --> 05:19:54,520
So, you know, humans got to step up and do the right thing.

2613
05:20:00,520 --> 05:20:02,520
I usually like will leave Fia for like 10 minutes.

2614
05:20:02,520 --> 05:20:04,520
And I'll come back and be like, are you mad at me?

2615
05:20:04,520 --> 05:20:06,520
She'll give me a little hand lick.

2616
05:20:06,520 --> 05:20:08,520
And I'm like, okay, we're good.

2617
05:20:08,520 --> 05:20:10,520
All right.

2618
05:20:10,520 --> 05:20:12,520
I'm going to use the bathroom.

2619
05:20:40,520 --> 05:20:42,520
Okay.

2620
05:20:42,520 --> 05:20:44,520
Okay.

2621
05:20:44,520 --> 05:20:46,520
Okay.

2622
05:20:46,520 --> 05:20:48,520
Okay.

2623
05:20:48,520 --> 05:20:50,520
Okay.

2624
05:20:50,520 --> 05:20:52,520
Okay.

2625

Okay.

2632
05:21:08,520 --> 05:21:10,520
Alright.

2633
05:21:10,520 --> 05:21:12,520
Okay.

2634
05:21:12,520 --> 05:21:14,520
Okay.

2635
05:21:14,520 --> 05:21:16,520
Okay.

2636
05:21:28,520 --> 05:21:30,520
Yes, I washed my hands.

2637
05:21:30,520 --> 05:21:32,520
Let me switch the lights.

2638
05:21:32,520 --> 05:21:34,520
Sometimes it's too bright.

2639
05:21:38,520 --> 05:21:50,320
Actually I'll keep the light off, my tracking is still fine, I might be a little bit belated

2640
05:21:50,320 --> 05:21:59,360
but I have an iPhone, it's supposed to be able to track me in the dark, aww, aww it's

2641
05:21:59,360 --> 05:22:00,360
Freddy!

2642
05:22:00,360 --> 05:22:07,280
Hi Sheebie, it's me, Funtime Freddy, welcome back for more Elden Ring, Triggery!

2643
05:22:07,280 --> 05:22:18,000
Well thank you for waiting, what was I going to say, oh yeah one of my goals is to have

2644
05:22:18,000 --> 05:22:26,400
a charity stream at some point for cats with her condition but also like dogs get it too,

2645
05:22:26,400 --> 05:22:35,720
dogs more often than cats and people can get it so it's called, let me pull up the, it's

2646
05:22:35,720 --> 05:22:40,840
called Myasthenia Gravis, is a chronic autoimmune disease that causes weakness in the body's

2647
05:22:40,840 --> 05:22:50,160
voluntary muscles which antibodies destroy the communication between nerves and muscles

2648
05:22:50,160 --> 05:22:54,880
resulting in weakness of the skeletal muscles and it's funny because like I also have an

2649
05:22:54,880 --> 05:22:59,160
autoimmune disease and I have fibromyalgia and so when they told me that she has this

2650
05:22:59,160 --> 05:23:04,760
I'm like oh my stuff just tells me that I'm in pain all the time so I'm just, it's kind

2651
05:23:04,800 --> 05:23:12,120
of funny that we ended up together but yeah no I would love to do that because yeah people

2652
05:23:12,120 --> 05:23:17,440
have it cats and dogs get it so I would love to do a charity stream for that at some point

2653
05:23:17,440 --> 05:23:23,400
because it's very hard to treat the disease besides with like steroids and hopefully like

2654
05:23:23,400 --> 05:23:31,320
trying to get the antibodies to do the right thing but I'm glad you guys agree with that

2655
05:23:32,320 --> 05:23:38,080
I completely understand your love for, yeah no yeah like they're all I have like I've only ever

2656
05:23:38,080 --> 05:23:44,840
grown up with like cats and dogs I'm an only child so besides you know my giant cotton

2657
05:23:44,840 --> 05:23:49,760
bin family but you guys know what I mean so I've always been very close with animals and stuff

2658
05:23:49,760 --> 05:23:58,560
always cool I remember when I was younger my, my nana she was cleaning the pool because my

2659
05:23:59,200 --> 05:24:05,960
grandparents on my mom's side had a pool and she was she had taken off the tarp it was like

2660
05:24:05,960 --> 05:24:12,920
right after fall they're opening up the pool and there was like some frogs in there so she

2661
05:24:12,920 --> 05:24:17,120
tossed them out but there's also like a chipmunk in there swimming around so she took it and like

2662
05:24:17,120 --> 05:24:25,520
chucked it out of there and I like I think I was probably like 11 years old I um I took off my

2663
05:24:25,520 --> 05:24:30,800
sweatshirt I scolded my grandmother at the age of 12 I'm like why did you do you could have killed

2664
05:24:30,800 --> 05:24:41,560
it and um this picture's a fee on my alt account and um so I took so my grandmother chucks this

2665
05:24:41,560 --> 05:24:49,840
chipmunk out of the pool it like almost like hits against the fence that's in the backyard I run

2666
05:24:49,920 --> 05:24:57,880
over I take off my little sweatshirt my little hoodie and I wrap my um hoodie around the chipmunk

2667
05:24:57,880 --> 05:25:05,880
and I pick it up and I um I bring it all the way to like the sunlight and stuff and I try

2668
05:25:05,880 --> 05:25:11,440
warming it up and I like I didn't give it mouth to mouth but I did like little chest compressions

2669
05:25:11,440 --> 05:25:18,960
because when I was younger I wanted to be a veterinarian um it was very much like my dream

2670
05:25:18,960 --> 05:25:25,840
to be a veterinarian when I was younger and so I was able to resuscitate the uh the chipmunk

2671
05:25:26,880 --> 05:25:33,440
and then uh I remember bringing it and I was holding it because I could see it was awake and

2672
05:25:33,440 --> 05:25:39,040
stuff I brought it over to like the edge um of my grandparents property that's like kind of the

2673
05:25:39,040 --> 05:25:44,000
other forest and I put it down on the ground and it like kind of like blinked and looked at me

2674
05:25:44,000 --> 05:25:49,120
like a thank you and then it ran off it was great and then since that day I was like I'm

2675
05:25:49,120 --> 05:25:53,280
gonna save lives but I didn't become a veterinarian because then I realized how refreshing it was

2676
05:25:55,200 --> 05:26:01,920
yeah they gotta do some stats for another reason um yeah my mom was very sad on me being a vet uh

2677
05:26:01,920 --> 05:26:10,000
she like wanted me to go to a like a vocational school for it um but I I lied to her when I said

2678
05:26:10,800 --> 05:26:14,720
this is like when I was this is like a high school vocational school um

2679
05:26:15,520 --> 05:26:21,200
and I turned I said to applied because I was just very self destructive I was just like I don't

2680
05:26:21,200 --> 05:26:34,000
deserve a veterinarian so yeah it's a tough job it's a very tough job um just the conversations I

2681
05:26:34,000 --> 05:26:41,120
have like with my vet like I would just cry the entire time if I was a vet like seriously I have

2682
05:26:41,120 --> 05:26:57,680
too empathetic for that um okay so let's go to Moog far across the distance in spaces between us

2683
05:26:57,680 --> 05:27:07,760
oh thank you guys thank you I appreciate it

2684
05:27:11,680 --> 05:27:17,680
everybody deserves a little kindness from the smallest animals to accept mosquitoes because

2685
05:27:17,680 --> 05:27:28,160
I destroyed that mosquito um to to humans to the biggest biggest things oh I thought I was going down

2686
05:27:28,160 --> 05:27:40,560
for a second um I'm gonna try to I'm actually honestly terrified because this is the point

2687
05:27:41,120 --> 05:27:49,760
where I beat Moog and then I gotta do the DLC and I'm honestly so scared because I know everything

2688
05:27:49,760 --> 05:27:56,880
about the base game and I know nothing about DLC except for the lore and I'm so anxious to cross

2689
05:27:56,880 --> 05:28:09,920
that into the unknown into the unknown and centipedes and ticks I actually I don't mind

2690
05:28:09,920 --> 05:28:15,680
centipedes I don't like house centipedes they they're the things that look like uh the Celia

2691
05:28:15,680 --> 05:28:25,680
crystal cave things um can I I didn't mean to do that I meant to do the flask but that's fine

2692
05:28:26,880 --> 05:28:34,320
probably should have done it when he appeared but it's cool doesn't matter

2693
05:28:34,640 --> 05:28:47,600
Moog deserved better Micola is a gaslighter and tricks people oh it's so creepy though

2694
05:28:52,000 --> 05:28:59,680
reach out touch babe it's weird that's like Micola's arm because like he's supposed to be like

2695
05:28:59,680 --> 05:29:10,000
an immortal child well like forever cursed to be a child um but he's like in the egg he's kind of

2696
05:29:10,000 --> 05:29:25,440
like normal sized I just like the song centipede by knife party I love knife party

2697
05:29:25,840 --> 05:29:27,840
centipede

2698
05:29:33,280 --> 05:29:40,560
I'm so sorry that you were hypnotized against your will to be in love with him so that he

2699
05:29:40,560 --> 05:29:45,440
would poison your you would poison his blood just so he could go to the shadow lands

2700
05:29:50,240 --> 05:29:52,720
it's so funny his voice doesn't match the character to me

2701
05:29:56,400 --> 05:30:00,000
and Moog has such an interesting face compared to like market

2702
05:30:06,880 --> 05:30:12,240
he sounds so sweet when he talks to Micola and then he sounds like a dick um

2703
05:30:14,640 --> 05:30:17,920
otherwise uh I realize I probably should have

2704
05:30:18,880 --> 05:30:20,880
uh oh

2705
05:30:23,840 --> 05:30:27,520
I forget his moveset already what's how does this work

2706
05:30:36,560 --> 05:30:44,240
hmm oh where's my sword hello whoa what's happening here

2707
05:30:48,880 --> 05:30:52,640
whoa I'm like scared to get close

2708
05:30:54,800 --> 05:30:58,720
although he has like the same moveset as all the oh get out the way get out the way

2709
05:31:04,480 --> 05:31:08,480
twist

2710
05:31:11,200 --> 05:31:14,640
I hear somebody throwing up in the background who is it

2711
05:31:18,480 --> 05:31:20,960

05:33:41,760 --> 05:33:47,200
okay I think yeah with uh with the mimic I kind of I don't want to try a couple times without the

2728
05:33:47,200 --> 05:33:52,640
mimic because again I beat so many the bosses like I just like literally maxed out the black knife

2729
05:33:52,640 --> 05:33:58,240
and I maxed out my mimic and I was just like yeah and I'll just cheese and I'll just let the thing

2730
05:33:58,240 --> 05:34:04,240
wear it down and get propped and all that stuff and I'm just like no you know what this time I'm

05:34:35,520 --> 05:34:36,720
oh I ran into that

2736
05:34:36,880 --> 05:34:46,240

2737
05:34:51,200 --> 05:34:54,240

2786
05:40:37,600 --> 05:40:46,640
free all the stupid stuff um it's probably destiny I think I was pretty good at destiny

2787
05:40:47,280 --> 05:40:52,960
but I like that I was like good I wasn't like cracked like I'm not cracked at games

2788
05:40:52,960 --> 05:41:00,960
I usually just get I'm just like decent you know yeah halo odst is also really good yeah I agree

2789
05:41:02,240 --> 05:41:06,000

05:41:28,240 --> 05:41:40,720
does everything need arcane dumb I can't even use a torch can't even use a torch pull

2793
05:41:40,720 --> 05:41:47,840
I don't have enough strength for the torch pull can I wait for it oh actually no I can use this

2794
05:41:54,400 --> 05:41:56,080
uh let's try it

2795
05:41:59,920 --> 05:42:08,720
because this is blood loss buildup 50 and then how much is that for yeah okay we'll try it

2796
05:42:10,720 --> 05:42:19,840
tf2 I never played tf2 I liked I like I played instead of tf2 I played gary's mod a lot like I

2797
05:42:19,840 --> 05:42:26,720
was like prop hunt uh ttt again I want to get a game together or I can play that with the girls

2798
05:42:32,080 --> 05:42:34,720
I think that would be super fun

2799
05:42:40,880 --> 05:42:50,720
oh

2800
05:42:56,400 --> 05:42:58,880
I can't why are you backing up I can't hit you

2801
05:43:02,880 --> 05:43:04,720
I should jump forward

2802
05:43:04,720 --> 05:43:06,720
so

2803
05:43:09,520 --> 05:43:11,200
for him you need to be close to him

2804
05:43:13,440 --> 05:43:15,840
I'm just back up I'm like not ready right now

2805
05:43:16,160 --> 05:43:17,840
I'm

2806

2808
05:43:41,840 --> 05:43:43,840
pocket sands

2809
05:43:46,240 --> 05:43:47,600
I never played a monster hunter

2810
05:43:50,480 --> 05:43:55,920
most of 15 because I know like that would be so fun but the thing is like I don't think people

2811
05:43:55,920 --> 05:44:02,000
would play ttt like I don't think they would because of the name that's why I would probably try to do a

2812
05:44:02,000 --> 05:44:07,120
prop hunt you know people can be like sensitive and stuff

2813
05:44:07,600 --> 05:44:08,400
so

2814
05:44:13,840 --> 05:44:16,400
I can do this without the mimic here

2815
05:44:30,080 --> 05:44:32,400
oh no

2816
05:44:37,920 --> 05:44:38,400
oh

2817
05:44:42,800 --> 05:44:44,400
no I was too late that time

2818
05:44:55,120 --> 05:44:56,400

2819
05:45:02,080 --> 05:45:03,760

2820
05:45:04,000 --> 05:45:06,000
oh

2821
05:45:19,440 --> 05:45:25,280
yeah like I very much like I remember when I was younger I literally wanted to be a

2822
05:45:25,280 --> 05:45:32,240
professional csgo player oh hi boomi oh are you coming to snog what's happening

2823
05:45:33,120 --> 05:45:39,840

2824
05:45:40,800 --> 05:45:41,840
oh

2825
05:45:49,120 --> 05:45:50,720
this now he's with the boomerster

2826
05:45:56,560 --> 05:45:57,840
this is worth it

2827
05:46:02,960 --> 05:46:03,520
oh

2828
05:46:05,360 --> 05:46:10,400
his voice goes high like sweetly when he talks about michael it's funny oh hi boomi

2829
05:46:10,400 --> 05:46:11,360
you're switching shoulders

2830
05:46:15,360 --> 05:46:16,960
man there's no respect for puzzle

2831
05:46:19,040 --> 05:46:26,560
there's no respect for knights oh my god he's purring boomi why are you so sweet today

2832
05:46:27,520 --> 05:46:30,240
he's like the knight's my strength because I'm worried about your sister

2833
05:46:32,160 --> 05:46:38,880
oh he's really he gives like small rumbles he has it like uh purred really hard since he was a

2834
05:46:38,880 --> 05:46:45,280
kitten that's why I missed his he's made the he did the loudest kitten purrs but now he's too cool

2835
05:46:45,280 --> 05:46:56,400
for that but I'm getting a little rumble yeah I feel like I'm just a crazy

2836
05:46:56,560 --> 05:46:59,360
cat lady and all I do is talk about my cats I'm so sorry

2837
05:47:02,080 --> 05:47:03,600
very very drop sweet boomi

2838
05:47:09,040 --> 05:47:13,280
I don't know why the purrs stop at least you're just hanging out it's fine

2839
05:47:18,320 --> 05:47:22,000
the only time boomi wants to be held is when I come out of the shower which I don't really

2840
05:47:22,000 --> 05:47:22,960
understand why that is

2841
05:47:26,960 --> 05:47:33,520
no I need to brush you you're very

2842
05:47:41,360 --> 05:47:45,760
like he just insists insist to be picked up when I come out of the shower

2843
05:47:45,760 --> 05:47:50,400
like I'll walk towards the sink to like start to like brush my teeth or something

2844
05:47:51,360 --> 05:47:57,280
after I shower and he'll just come up and put his paws on my shoulder and ask to be picked up

2845
05:47:57,280 --> 05:48:01,600
and he'll make a beat a little purr and so I'll hold him for like a minute and then I put him

2846
05:48:01,600 --> 05:48:05,840
down and then he's satisfied I don't know why that's his routine

2847
05:48:10,960 --> 05:48:16,320
why do you look like you're crying are you okay are you feeling emotional boomi

2848
05:48:20,560 --> 05:48:25,680
yeah I think it's that like I definitely think it's like a smell thing

2849
05:48:28,880 --> 05:48:36,320
because boomi likes laying on like my clothes and stuff but he won't lay on me

2850
05:48:36,640 --> 05:48:42,240
so

2851
05:48:48,160 --> 05:48:49,840
that's why he's letting me hold him for this long

2852
05:48:52,240 --> 05:48:53,440
boomi is a sundae right

2853
05:48:55,280 --> 05:49:01,680
because he guesses of these uh no boomi usually like um

2854
05:49:02,640 --> 05:49:08,560
he likes to like stretch on me like he'll like reach his little hands up as if he wants

2855
05:49:08,560 --> 05:49:13,200
upies but he'll just stretch on my leg and then sometimes he forgets that even when I'm wearing

2856
05:49:13,200 --> 05:49:21,040
pants he can't use his claws oh my gosh boomi I need to brush you you don't shed this much

2857
05:49:21,040 --> 05:49:27,040
and I have cat hair all over my face and it's tickling me it's so worth

2858
05:49:31,680 --> 05:49:35,040
it

2859
05:49:37,840 --> 05:49:40,000
just the mom was but he is a mama's boy

2860
05:49:41,200 --> 05:49:42,480
he's a mama's boy

2861
05:49:49,920 --> 05:49:51,200
he like really likes my mom

2862
05:49:52,240 --> 05:49:55,200
anytime my mom comes over like boomi like loves my mom

2863
05:49:55,920 --> 05:49:59,360
and I've never seen him get so excited for anybody else besides my mom

2864
05:50:02,080 --> 05:50:05,040
so

2865
05:50:14,960 --> 05:50:19,360
boomi are you realizing it's a good thing to be held is this is what's happening right now

2866
05:50:19,360 --> 05:50:22,800
I'm gonna put you in the bed though my arms are hurting because you're heavy

2867
05:50:23,920 --> 05:50:27,360
and I'm going to brush you because you're literally covered in cat hair

2868
05:50:31,920 --> 05:50:35,040

okay I am so determined to do this

2899
05:54:49,680 --> 05:54:53,360
I usually switch between my items really slowly too I'm not super fast with it

2900
05:54:53,360 --> 05:54:57,120
because I have to take my thumb off the stick which I hate

2901
05:54:57,440 --> 05:55:02,480

2902
05:55:09,120 --> 05:55:16,480

I have to like claw it I don't know how people do that

2908
05:56:06,320 --> 05:56:16,480
I don't know why I did that because I make a difference

2909
05:56:23,200 --> 05:56:23,840
come back here

2910
05:56:24,160 --> 05:56:34,800
oh

2911
05:56:34,800 --> 05:56:36,800
Oh

2912
05:57:00,480 --> 05:57:02,480
Oh

2913
05:57:03,480 --> 05:57:08,240
Oh my god, why am I doing so bad like I was actually doing better in the beginning

2914
05:57:10,280 --> 05:57:14,120
Yeah, I know he's literally a Margaret. That's why I'm like what the heck

2915
05:57:15,160 --> 05:57:17,440
Cuz the thing where he like tosses the blood

2916
05:57:19,360 --> 05:57:24,580
Is literally like when heat Margaret throws the swords

2917
05:57:32,480 --> 05:57:34,480
Oh

2918
05:57:59,640 --> 05:58:01,640
Damn that was cold

2919
05:58:02,680 --> 05:58:04,680
Oh

2920
05:58:08,760 --> 05:58:13,200
Yeah, he's not bad thank you for it's gonna be great when I get past

2921
05:58:13,920 --> 05:58:17,520
The 15 mark and I just start to feel bad about myself because you said that thank you

2922
05:58:18,880 --> 05:58:20,880
Okay

2923
05:58:21,840 --> 05:58:23,840
Stare him down

2924
05:58:32,480 --> 05:58:34,480
Oh

2925
05:58:55,400 --> 05:58:57,400
That was a waste of a flask

2926
05:58:58,200 --> 05:59:03,920
I need to be behind him that's literally a

2927
05:59:09,040 --> 05:59:15,460
Cuz it's so funny cuz you'll walk like I watched somebody play against him like 50 times and I'm still like trash

2928
05:59:17,880 --> 05:59:20,960
Although obviously it's different from you like doing the controllers yourself

2929
05:59:21,600 --> 05:59:25,720
But like I don't know it's just weird like I felt so confident going into this

2930
05:59:28,400 --> 05:59:30,400
Why is my eye twitching

2931
05:59:45,240 --> 05:59:47,240
We guys sometimes get stuck in an animation

2932
05:59:50,640 --> 05:59:52,640
It's too late for that

2933
05:59:53,880 --> 05:59:55,880
Too early for that

2934
05:59:56,120 --> 05:59:58,120
He goes

2935
05:59:59,240 --> 06:00:01,240
One two

2936
06:00:03,520 --> 06:00:06,960
Something he's doing one two, but it's one two

2937
06:00:07,920 --> 06:00:12,040
One two three. It's it's literally three seconds. Hi boomie

2938
06:00:12,640 --> 06:00:15,740
Are you gonna go to the end of it again? Come on get into bed

2939
06:00:16,200 --> 06:00:18,200
Get into bed. Don't be scared of the Tupperware

2940
06:00:18,920 --> 06:00:21,180
Get in the best because I have the cake Tupperware

2941
06:00:26,000 --> 06:00:28,000
Get into bed

2942
06:00:28,920 --> 06:00:35,600
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about that's what I'm talking about cat time

2943
06:00:38,360 --> 06:00:40,360
Here

2944
06:00:40,360 --> 06:00:59,280
I'm trying to find a bright website so you guys can see it. I'm just gonna put Twitter on light mode

2945
06:01:10,360 --> 06:01:12,360
I

2946
06:01:19,960 --> 06:01:23,800
Don't even put Twitter on light mode. I don't even know on desktop

2947
06:01:31,480 --> 06:01:36,420
Maybe that's a good thing I don't know oh my god, boomie. You're so cute right now. What's up with your face?

2948
06:01:40,840 --> 06:01:42,840
Oh

2949
06:01:43,200 --> 06:01:45,200
There you go

2950
06:01:46,480 --> 06:01:51,680
Kind of helps brighten although you can only see boomies boomie booty I

2951
06:01:55,200 --> 06:02:00,120
Am kind of flash painting banging myself, but it's helpful cuz the so that for the tracking as well

2952
06:02:01,560 --> 06:02:03,960
All right, come on she be

2953
06:02:05,440 --> 06:02:07,440
It has been six hours

2954
06:02:07,440 --> 06:02:13,920
We've gotten kind of nowhere just get the show in the road shall we

2955
06:02:38,280 --> 06:02:41,780
Again too early

2956
06:02:53,240 --> 06:02:55,240
Too late

2957
06:03:07,440 --> 06:03:09,440
Oh

2958
06:03:29,280 --> 06:03:31,280
Why does it always get me

2959
06:03:38,200 --> 06:03:40,200
I

2960
06:03:43,080 --> 06:03:48,520
Think time flies when you're having fun six people are ours couldn't hurt

2961
06:03:53,840 --> 06:04:01,140
Maybe if I two-handed let's just do that I think I'm getting distracted by the flail

2962
06:04:07,440 --> 06:04:09,440
Oh

2963
06:04:38,000 --> 06:04:41,040
He's honestly very forgiving

2964
06:04:53,320 --> 06:04:56,760
You watch my game is me getting my butt kicked make you feel better

2965
06:04:56,760 --> 06:05:01,520
Is this why you guys watch me when I'm like this and I'm playing Elden Rings

2966
06:05:01,520 --> 06:05:03,520
It's the only time that my butt will be kicked

2967
06:05:08,160 --> 06:05:10,160
But talk he's a coolie

2968
06:05:33,200 --> 06:05:35,200
He has crazy reach

2969
06:05:38,440 --> 06:05:40,440
Really

2970
06:05:50,120 --> 06:05:54,560
Why is I don't I think I'm so used to like

2971
06:05:55,320 --> 06:05:56,640
Godric

2972
06:05:56,640 --> 06:06:00,960
That I'm thinking the timing of him because he's like one extra second

2973
06:06:01,360 --> 06:06:05,080
Or like millisecond and I'm still jumping before it

2974
06:06:08,320 --> 06:06:10,320
I

2975
06:06:19,080 --> 06:06:25,840
Didn't press B. I'm stuck. He really has me like sunlocked

2976
06:06:37,440 --> 06:06:39,440
I

2977
06:06:39,440 --> 06:06:41,440
I

2978
06:06:41,440 --> 06:06:43,440
I

2979
06:07:03,680 --> 06:07:07,280
Am I just not I like literally I'm frustrated because I didn't want to get the timing right

2980
06:07:08,280 --> 06:07:11,840
It's a dark cat camp. Yeah, there's really no point anymore having the cat camp up

2981
06:07:13,800 --> 06:07:16,480
Sorry, boo me your time is done

2982
06:07:17,680 --> 06:07:19,680
Give you a pet

2983
06:07:30,280 --> 06:07:32,280
Nicholas mine

2984
06:07:33,280 --> 06:07:35,280
Oh

2985
06:07:35,880 --> 06:07:42,600
Poop just you for good luck. Oh, my game just lagged. What was up with that?

2986
06:07:53,440 --> 06:07:55,440
Oh

2987
06:07:57,240 --> 06:08:00,560
I was like, why is it showing that I can wield it now that is not the case

2988
06:08:02,280 --> 06:08:04,280
I

2989
06:08:19,720 --> 06:08:24,800
That's not what I want to do why can't I what am I doing?

2990
06:08:28,240 --> 06:08:30,240
Thank you Jesus Christ

2991
06:08:33,280 --> 06:08:35,280
I

2992
06:08:39,480 --> 06:08:41,480
Scratch my nose

2993
06:08:50,800 --> 06:08:54,160
Like I feel like the hip-hop so I'm like really in what the frick

2994
06:08:54,160 --> 06:08:58,700
I don't even know you killed me already when I'm in that close if she shouldn't be able to hit me with the staff

2995
06:08:59,700 --> 06:09:01,700
I

2996
06:09:06,740 --> 06:09:09,740
Can't do dual swords. I don't have a blood build-up sword

2997
06:09:09,740 --> 06:09:13,140
I would have to use the flail and I tried that but it was just wasn't really working

2998
06:09:28,700 --> 06:09:30,700
I

2999
06:09:45,780 --> 06:09:47,780
Thought that wouldn't hit me

3000
06:09:59,700 --> 06:10:01,700
Again

3001
06:10:07,700 --> 06:10:10,340
I thought I could jump out of that. I guess not me back up

3002
06:10:22,460 --> 06:10:26,820
What I actually timed that probably like a millisecond off

3003
06:10:29,060 --> 06:10:31,060
I

3004
06:10:34,060 --> 06:10:38,660
Like I'm trying to like strafe him and I can't I don't know what's up with that

3005
06:10:42,100 --> 06:10:45,180
I don't like I'm trying to move behind I

3006
06:10:48,180 --> 06:10:50,180
Didn't think you'd go on a third time

3007
06:10:58,700 --> 06:11:00,700
I

3008
06:11:04,820 --> 06:11:06,820
Why do you back up so fast

3009
06:11:24,100 --> 06:11:26,100
I don't know why I didn't get into a second phase

3010
06:11:29,700 --> 06:11:31,700
More these

3011
06:11:33,980 --> 06:11:40,060
Yeah, maybe I need to I'm gonna try to do know something like I don't know why I feel like I'll be like cheatsy doodling I

3012
06:11:40,820 --> 06:11:42,820
Want to try my bestest I

3013
06:11:44,220 --> 06:11:46,220
Want to see if I can get I'm like super close

3014
06:11:49,460 --> 06:11:53,340
If for the next few attempts I can't get him to his second phase and I'm just gonna

3015
06:11:54,340 --> 06:11:58,540
No, you know what I forgot to come on. I already fucked this up

3016
06:12:09,420 --> 06:12:15,200
Oh my god, oh my god, I'm literally already gonna die

3017
06:12:15,200 --> 06:12:22,300
Oh, how did that not hit me? That's a great question. I

3018
06:12:30,680 --> 06:12:32,680
Thought I thought I know I didn't dodge that one

3019
06:12:32,680 --> 06:12:34,680
Oh

3020
06:12:41,840 --> 06:12:45,800
Me so give me your strength when we're 10 I'm doing so bad

3021
06:12:47,360 --> 06:12:49,360
I'm being disheartened

3022
06:12:53,360 --> 06:12:58,080
He's like stretched his neck out like he's a god-skinned Apostles

3023
06:13:02,680 --> 06:13:04,680
I

3024
06:13:19,920 --> 06:13:22,540
Like can't hit him, but he can hit me

3025
06:13:29,160 --> 06:13:31,160
Again too soon

3026
06:13:33,680 --> 06:13:38,840
I know this is if he cuz his cat hair keep having to move my stuff

3027
06:13:40,760 --> 06:13:44,680
Me the gods can apostle when me is a god-skinned Apostle

3028
06:13:48,560 --> 06:13:52,520
Yeah, he knows it, you know, she's the God-skinned Apostle

3029
06:13:56,280 --> 06:13:58,280
Come on

3030
06:13:58,800 --> 06:14:00,800
No, I took forever do that animation

3031
06:14:02,800 --> 06:14:04,800
Oh

3032
06:14:07,600 --> 06:14:09,600
Why don't I feel like I'm too heavy

3033
06:14:16,120 --> 06:14:18,120
Okay

3034
06:14:20,640 --> 06:14:24,600
Okay, all right, it looks like I have to

3035
06:14:25,680 --> 06:14:28,680
Since I can't get him to the second phase and so many attempts

3036
06:14:29,680 --> 06:14:31,400
I will

3037
06:14:31,440 --> 06:14:33,720
Use the mimic tear I

3038
06:14:35,440 --> 06:14:38,080
Didn't want to but I am just not good enough

3039
06:14:39,040 --> 06:14:41,040
It sucks

3040
06:14:41,440 --> 06:14:45,000
If I was playing this by myself without streaming I probably would have

3041
06:15:01,400 --> 06:15:05,800
Done this like in a billion attempts, but I don't want to do it in a billion attempts

3042
06:15:08,960 --> 06:15:11,320
Can you get out of there dude like why are you

3043
06:15:24,760 --> 06:15:26,800
I don't think the mimic tears gonna help I

3044
06:15:31,480 --> 06:15:33,480
Don't

3045
06:15:48,040 --> 06:15:52,240
That one like jam into the ground thing is interesting

3046
06:15:52,480 --> 06:16:01,920
Because I'll just take too long if I don't use this I'm in but like I like to like try to do stuff by myself, you know

3047
06:16:12,600 --> 06:16:14,600
Probably should have done the thing first

3048
06:16:14,600 --> 06:16:22,520
Are you not locked on me

3049
06:16:34,920 --> 06:16:36,920
Why is that last forever

3050
06:16:44,600 --> 06:16:46,600
I

3051
06:17:14,600 --> 06:17:16,600
I

3052
06:17:25,480 --> 06:17:27,640
Spock yeah, I was like, where's this

3053
06:17:45,360 --> 06:17:47,360
Oh

3054
06:17:56,960 --> 06:18:01,560
Okay, well now I know I can beat him with the the mimic tears, so

3055
06:18:09,280 --> 06:18:11,280
Well, he's looking at me all funny

3056
06:18:14,600 --> 06:18:29,320
He stops often over here, let's see if I can get behind him

3057
06:18:40,760 --> 06:18:42,760
I'm just trying to get behind

3058
06:18:45,600 --> 06:18:52,360
Yeah, I know it's good. I know the moment I jumped I was gonna die

3059
06:19:02,200 --> 06:19:04,680
You cursed it you cursed it bro

3060
06:19:07,720 --> 06:19:09,720
You're gonna stretch in your paw paws out

3061
06:19:14,600 --> 06:19:16,600
I

3062
06:19:16,600 --> 06:19:18,600
Don't

3063
06:19:41,040 --> 06:19:44,840
I probably went too far away. I thought he was still aggroed on me and my nose

3064
06:19:46,760 --> 06:19:52,720
No, I was paying attention to my health

3065
06:20:00,080 --> 06:20:02,080
Nine nine

3066
06:20:08,240 --> 06:20:10,240
Thanks for stopping by

3067
06:20:10,240 --> 06:20:16,440
Oh, come on I'm tired of this grandpa

3068
06:20:40,720 --> 06:20:42,400
What oh I was in the

3069
06:20:45,120 --> 06:20:48,160
Why was it working before when I was like that close

3070
06:20:54,760 --> 06:21:02,280
No, I'm not gonna laser I don't have a Zers comment. I think I have to have until the minor intelligence of like

3071
06:21:03,280 --> 06:21:05,280
I

3072
06:21:08,280 --> 06:21:10,520
Also just don't have a good mimic here to be honest

3073
06:21:32,280 --> 06:21:34,280
I

3074
06:22:02,280 --> 06:22:04,280
I

3075
06:22:15,880 --> 06:22:17,880
Come on dude, I was

3076
06:22:24,720 --> 06:22:26,720
Like I

3077
06:22:26,840 --> 06:22:30,400
Don't know how he's like literally just like to shoddy me so easily

3078
06:22:30,400 --> 06:22:35,560
Maybe I should have done 60 bigger cuz this is ridiculous

3079
06:23:00,400 --> 06:23:02,400
I

3080
06:23:02,400 --> 06:23:04,400
I

3081
06:23:32,400 --> 06:23:36,800
Yeah, that's what I was trying. I'm like kind of trying to spam through his first phase

3082
06:23:38,320 --> 06:23:42,600
And get to the like try to get him as low as possible with the mimic here

3083
06:23:42,600 --> 06:23:46,360
You know, I should like I said, I should be not doing the mimic here until I do this

3084
06:23:46,360 --> 06:23:52,000
But you know the physics, but I don't know if that matters. I can't remember if they can't use physics or not

3085
06:24:02,400 --> 06:24:04,400
You

3086
06:24:12,200 --> 06:24:14,200
Back up

3087
06:24:26,640 --> 06:24:28,640
Come on get out of your stupid fire

3088
06:24:32,400 --> 06:24:34,400
Oh

3089
06:25:03,400 --> 06:25:05,400
I

3090
06:25:08,640 --> 06:25:11,760
Again he two shots me again he two shots me

3091
06:25:25,840 --> 06:25:28,160
Okay, you know what I feel like maybe

3092
06:25:29,160 --> 06:25:32,640
And do this first maybe if I already have the

3093
06:25:33,280 --> 06:25:40,520
Physics when I summon I don't know if that helps it. I don't know if this gets affected by that to be honest with you

3094
06:25:58,160 --> 06:26:00,160
I

3095
06:26:08,760 --> 06:26:12,760
Think he's already he's already almost dead

3096
06:26:12,960 --> 06:26:14,960
And

3097
06:26:27,200 --> 06:26:32,560
I can't repost him cuz I'm in his fucking thing

3098
06:26:42,760 --> 06:26:44,760
I

3099
06:26:44,760 --> 06:26:46,760
I

3100
06:27:06,840 --> 06:27:12,800
Didn't see my health. Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm sorry guys. I I didn't see my health. I didn't see my health

3101
06:27:13,800 --> 06:27:15,880
I didn't see my health. I'm sorry

3102
06:27:36,360 --> 06:27:39,040
I'm not gonna heal until I feel like I actually need it

3103
06:27:39,520 --> 06:27:42,320
Think I've been using up a flask and I don't really need you yet

3104
06:27:55,160 --> 06:28:00,040
Like now would be a good time like now would be a great time

3105
06:28:10,040 --> 06:28:17,480
How am I getting hit by that see the freaking things almost dead and I don't have time

3106
06:28:17,480 --> 06:28:19,480
I

3107
06:28:37,160 --> 06:28:39,160
Maybe I need to do heavy attacks

3108
06:28:41,080 --> 06:28:46,800
Why are you so cute? I'm thinking I need to do heavy attacks instead of I've just been yeah

3109
06:28:47,480 --> 06:28:49,480
I

3110
06:28:55,320 --> 06:28:57,320
Honestly think I might get more

3111
06:29:17,960 --> 06:29:19,960
Back up back up

3112
06:29:26,160 --> 06:29:28,160
Can't get close to do this

3113
06:29:34,560 --> 06:29:39,400
Did you just see did you see him one shot me I

3114
06:29:40,040 --> 06:29:42,040
I

3115
06:29:43,640 --> 06:29:50,400
Only had maybe like I probably had like 70% health and he was able to one shot me

3116
06:29:53,880 --> 06:29:59,340
That that doesn't make any sense I didn't know he could do that I didn't know that hit those so that was that strong

3117
06:30:09,400 --> 06:30:11,400
I

3118
06:30:32,800 --> 06:30:34,800
Back up back up back up

3119
06:30:39,400 --> 06:30:41,400
Oh

3120
06:30:43,040 --> 06:30:45,040
My god

3121
06:30:56,360 --> 06:30:59,320
Come on get that blood proc get that blood proc. Oh, thank you

3122
06:31:01,640 --> 06:31:07,760
If you could just spam through his second phase you're literally golden. Thank you mimic tear appreciate you boo

3123
06:31:08,760 --> 06:31:10,760
All right

3124
06:31:11,400 --> 06:31:16,120
Sick I needed that reposs so bad. I needed that reposs

3125
06:31:20,600 --> 06:31:26,400
Again I didn't want to use the mimic tear, but I'm just not that good. I'll get better. I'll try my best. Just

3126
06:31:27,680 --> 06:31:29,680
That's how pull me

3127
06:31:30,360 --> 06:31:32,520
You're looking at the cat TV from the bed

3128
06:31:33,520 --> 06:31:42,360
All right, Micaela, what the hell hey

3129
06:31:47,240 --> 06:31:53,000
Yeah, totally sorry don't mind my sword just in my hand

3130
06:31:53,000 --> 06:32:04,880
Micaela the poopoo head

3131
06:32:15,080 --> 06:32:17,680
I really just want to play this for like ten hours

3132
06:32:20,160 --> 06:32:22,660
And tell the realm of shadow

3133
06:32:23,000 --> 06:32:27,340
Give him a kissy. I'm gonna kiss the ring not like giant Micaela's hand

3134
06:32:35,400 --> 06:32:37,400
Oh

3135
06:32:38,080 --> 06:32:44,400
All right, what's over here? Oh, at least I can bring toilet. Oh nothing

3136
06:32:53,960 --> 06:32:58,520
I don't know why this reminds me a pal world like this one step out like this

3137
06:32:59,240 --> 06:33:00,880
whoa

3138
06:33:00,880 --> 06:33:06,280
Again, I haven't seen anything like I've only seen the boss arenas. So this is

3139
06:33:07,400 --> 06:33:13,320
Crazy. Oh, it's cool. It's like a veil. I think that's something about like crossing the veil

3140
06:33:13,320 --> 06:33:15,320
And that's why Micaela had to do what he did

3141
06:33:16,120 --> 06:33:17,960
to um

3142
06:33:17,960 --> 06:33:19,640
Get into the

3143
06:33:19,720 --> 06:33:23,800
Realm of shadow, you know, it's interesting. I just noticed so on the earth tree

3144
06:33:24,040 --> 06:33:26,920
There is a portion of the bark that is dark

3145
06:33:27,560 --> 06:33:31,160
And it's funny that on the scudoo tree. There's a portion of the bark

3146
06:33:31,720 --> 06:33:33,880
That is gold and what's interesting

3147
06:33:34,040 --> 06:33:37,800
I can't recall if Merica made the scudoo tree or when

3148
06:33:38,440 --> 06:33:42,040
Because again the realm of shadow used to be

3149
06:33:43,720 --> 06:33:45,720
Part

3150
06:33:45,880 --> 06:33:49,720
Of the lands between normally. Oh, there's a lot of stuff falling from that

3151
06:33:50,360 --> 06:33:56,440
Um until Merica separated it to hide her past. Oh god. I can see the fire golem from here

3152
06:33:57,080 --> 06:33:58,680
um

3153
06:33:58,680 --> 06:33:59,880
He is

3154
06:33:59,880 --> 06:34:01,880
standing menacingly

3155
06:34:01,960 --> 06:34:03,960
So it's it's quite interesting

3156
06:34:07,080 --> 06:34:12,200
It's funny that Merica's grace is here because usually I believe there's not a lot of great graces

3157
06:34:16,680 --> 06:34:18,680
Um

3158
06:34:24,280 --> 06:34:27,400
I can't I don't I have to get glove work for that

3159
06:34:30,120 --> 06:34:32,840
And I brought I kind of want to go through stuff

3160
06:34:34,520 --> 06:34:38,040
That's why there's like no enemies like jumping out of the grass that one

3161
06:34:39,400 --> 06:34:41,400
He's like, what are these things?

3162
06:34:42,120 --> 06:34:44,040
Like statues or are there

3163
06:34:44,040 --> 06:34:46,040
Things I have to fight

3164
06:34:47,960 --> 06:34:51,800
I kind of just want to see that as a thing I have to fight

3165
06:34:55,240 --> 06:34:57,240
Oh, you were interesting

3166
06:34:58,840 --> 06:35:00,520
Oh

3167
06:35:00,520 --> 06:35:02,520
The thing you're weak to magic

3168
06:35:03,000 --> 06:35:05,480
What are you? What did I just kill? I don't even know

3169
06:35:06,440 --> 06:35:08,440
Just killing things willy-nilly

3170
06:35:08,440 --> 06:35:10,440
Uh

3171
06:35:11,880 --> 06:35:13,880
Oh interesting

3172
06:35:15,480 --> 06:35:20,280
What are you guys you guys look like the equivalent of the old guy that points at stuff below but

3173
06:35:21,160 --> 06:35:23,160
No, interesting interesting

3174
06:35:27,560 --> 06:35:32,440
Yeah, yeah, I'll I'll do scadoo shadow shadow tree

3175
06:35:32,440 --> 06:35:36,600
Well, I'm going to call it a scadoo tree

3176
06:35:37,400 --> 06:35:40,520
The scabba da-da-da-da-da-do. I'm a scatree

3177
06:35:41,560 --> 06:35:43,800
bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup

3178
06:35:44,360 --> 06:35:46,360
I'm going to go to this tree over here

3179
06:35:47,240 --> 06:35:49,240
Because it looks like there's a map anyways

3180
06:35:54,380 --> 06:35:56,580
Skadoo shtree

3181
06:35:56,580 --> 06:35:58,580
Nine nine. Oh

3182
06:35:59,320 --> 06:36:00,680
The tree

3183
06:36:00,680 --> 06:36:07,560
the tree are you coming to the tree strange thing has happened

3184
06:36:09,320 --> 06:36:17,000
right yeah and i know like this is really essentially big if not bigger than the base game

3185
06:36:17,560 --> 06:36:21,960
map which is very very very cool to me uh i thought it would be a lot smaller

3186
06:36:23,640 --> 06:36:27,640
well these guys are just hanging out just hanging around silly

3187
06:36:27,880 --> 06:36:33,800
i thought there was something over here but it's just sheep and

3188
06:36:39,160 --> 06:36:45,240
uh white flesh we love to see it um i'm probably gonna do a lot here this is gonna be

3189
06:36:47,000 --> 06:36:51,400
hours again for longevity sake i don't know it's

3190
06:36:51,400 --> 06:37:02,440

3191
06:37:02,440 --> 06:37:09,960
too giddy like showing you guys everything to be honest probably like all the bosses and stuff

3192
06:37:09,960 --> 06:37:16,680
but like i'm gonna be doing a lot of exploration and all that um and i don't know for like from

3193
06:37:16,680 --> 06:37:24,920
a content creator standpoint if it would be good for algorithmic reasons to keep playing this online

3194
06:37:24,920 --> 06:37:33,240
um yeah okay i like because i want to show you guys everything and then like i probably will

3195

3199
06:37:59,880 --> 06:38:03,880
although i know i could literally just do this on torrent i didn't mean to sound like a mimic

3200

3303
06:51:42,520 --> 06:51:48,120
i'm gonna be playing with so many weapons i love two-handing weapons i i usually don't

3304
06:51:48,120 --> 06:51:52,040
though for games like this because there's usually just aren't weapons to two-handle

3305
06:51:53,640 --> 06:52:01,960
and sometimes these games

3306
06:52:07,080 --> 06:52:09,960
and it doesn't consume fp to do this which is interesting

3307
06:52:09,960 --> 06:52:21,800
this is just so sick

3308
06:52:22,520 --> 06:52:33,160
all right

3309
06:52:36,600 --> 06:52:39,800
can you stay in motion while running doing and doing a what

3310
06:52:43,000 --> 06:52:44,840
well i don't know what that means

3311
06:52:44,840 --> 06:52:52,360
i'm sorry

3312
06:52:56,280 --> 06:52:59,160
fist like i don't really like fist weapons i don't mind claws though

3313
06:53:01,000 --> 06:53:06,200
well i'm not gonna i'm not gonna use this i will be using my moon veil until i find something

3314
06:53:08,280 --> 06:53:14,360
just as worthy again because this is a plus 10 weapon i'm not gonna just not use it

3315
06:53:15,560 --> 06:53:22,840
i worked hard for the plus 10 um but i will like mess around for stuff what is over there

3316
06:53:27,480 --> 06:53:33,480
what's over here oh that's a can't go over there um can you hold on i like really

3317
06:53:33,480 --> 06:53:41,720
want to check my map to see if there's a way to cross uh i think it's down this way nope

3318
06:53:42,040 --> 06:53:48,200
all right yeah let's just divide so i'm naturally drawn to go over here i see michaels cross

3319
06:53:49,720 --> 06:53:54,360
they're doing dual lightning axes oh my god from soft you're spoiling us

3320
06:53:59,720 --> 06:54:04,760
i never did a claw build or any like play what is that

3321
06:54:05,000 --> 06:54:17,400
um are y'all gonna kill me who are y'all y'all is hanging out

3322
06:54:18,680 --> 06:54:23,240
sick scottish fragments can be found across the realm of shadow consume these at sites of

3323
06:54:23,240 --> 06:54:27,560
grace to bolter your scottish blessing the scottish blessing bolters or subordinatibilities

3324
06:54:27,560 --> 06:54:31,320
deal and negate damage has no influence outside the realm of shadow i like that they did that

3325
06:54:31,320 --> 06:54:35,160
because it makes sense unless you're doing like new game plus stuff but it like it's pretty sick

3326
06:54:40,040 --> 06:54:45,160
i'm trying to become a god hold on i read this and um melina's voice

3327
06:54:46,120 --> 06:54:54,840
carved words coalesce i abandon here the first of the flesh of my body of my body

3328
06:54:55,320 --> 06:55:01,320
i can't really do that she does like a weird thing premium blood version who are you

3329
06:55:03,160 --> 06:55:07,160
you look like you have a bum hole for a face oh aren't you one of the horn you're the caterpillar

3330
06:55:07,160 --> 06:55:19,400
dude that does terrible things what woman you're a really cool voice actor

3331
06:55:19,800 --> 06:55:27,800
and your kind are not forgiven that's not nice by marica long betrayed set aflame

3332
06:55:28,440 --> 06:55:34,760
i believe michela's apologies when he says i'll delivery will come but never will i see your

3333
06:55:34,760 --> 06:55:41,240
kind as worthy okay i kind of want to kill you for that

3334
06:55:42,120 --> 06:55:51,560
i'm very tempted to kill you for that but i won't because i know you do stuff other times

3335
06:55:52,120 --> 06:55:59,160
um you know what's really funny to me i don't get why michela wants to help him because if you

3336
06:55:59,160 --> 06:56:04,040
think if you know anything spoilers it'll head if you know anything about marica's backstory

3337
06:56:04,040 --> 06:56:10,040
that's revealed in this she is newman this is the the realm of shadow which was once part of

3338
06:56:10,040 --> 06:56:15,160
the lands between normally until she separated it because she wanted to hide her past uh the newmen

3339
06:56:15,160 --> 06:56:21,000
were very much abused by the horn sent um and then because of that marica punished them because they

3340
06:56:21,000 --> 06:56:24,760
forced them into these horrible jars and whipped them and tortured them and did all this terrible

3341
06:56:24,760 --> 06:56:33,800
things so i don't know why michela is trying to redeem these people um obviously michela wants

3342
06:56:33,800 --> 06:56:45,800
his own order which is totally fine um but he just said he just said he's gonna he's gonna do stuff

3343
06:56:49,640 --> 06:56:53,000
horn sent him on wrongly and completely did nothing wrong must create saints

3344
06:56:53,000 --> 06:56:55,240
you know and it's funny because i'm like how does that make them a saint

3345
06:56:56,440 --> 06:57:00,120
like how does that canonize that and i'm really i'm more interested in that process oh my gosh

3346
06:57:00,120 --> 06:57:05,400
we're like almost the same height what's up queen yeah a teeth whip i've seen the teeth whip um

3347
06:57:07,560 --> 06:57:13,080
he's very yeah best ashes award yeah that's why i'm not gonna i'm not gonna kill him because

3348
06:57:13,080 --> 06:57:19,480
i know he gives us something good um but michela isn't a kid he's just he's just he

3349
06:57:19,800 --> 06:57:26,280
he michela kind of reminds me of the um

3350
06:57:30,120 --> 06:57:37,640
the trope of like innocence being or like the abuse of more innocent things being inherently

3351
06:57:37,640 --> 06:57:45,320
evil or like innocent things can be like you know that like trope of like crazy characters

3352
06:57:45,320 --> 06:57:51,080
drinking milk like homelander clockwork orange um i'm pretty sure there was one like

3353
06:57:51,800 --> 06:57:56,200
one flew over the cuckoo's nest i can't remember um but like i know it's like a very like stanley

3354
06:57:56,200 --> 06:58:03,880
cubrick thing um and like michela is such an interesting character to me because he is this

3355
06:58:03,880 --> 06:58:10,120
he's a demigod he's about to become a god he's an imperian he is a god he's been around for a long

3356
06:58:10,120 --> 06:58:21,960
time his curse is eternal childhood but that necessarily i feel like in my opinion that

3357
06:58:21,960 --> 06:58:29,800
doesn't mean that he thinks like a child because like it's clear his aspirations of godhood are

3358
06:58:29,800 --> 06:58:34,280
not childlike i feel like if he was a child he wouldn't really be interested in those things

3359
06:58:34,360 --> 06:58:37,080
that was rena who was me out in the background um

3360
06:58:38,840 --> 06:58:45,880
and i feel like he takes his youthful appearance his innocence looking nature michela the kind and

3361
06:58:45,880 --> 06:58:53,720
that's like he uses you know his ability is to sway people and have people like be devoted to him

3362
06:58:53,720 --> 06:59:02,040
and fall in love with him um yeah but he's so he's so deluded though and what he thinks is kind

3363
06:59:02,040 --> 06:59:10,200
that he is forcing other people to do things for him much like a kid would like a kid kids

3364
06:59:10,200 --> 06:59:19,720
are master manipulators um they will say things to try to get their way and they will convince you

3365
06:59:19,720 --> 06:59:23,480
and then sometimes some people are pushovers because they're like oh they're a kid let's give

3366
06:59:23,480 --> 06:59:28,520
them what they want and so it's very interesting like michela's character is very very interesting

3367
06:59:28,520 --> 06:59:35,640
to me um yeah he's generally good intentions very deluded but he goes around the wrong way uh just

3368
06:59:35,640 --> 06:59:42,760
like and that kind of just shows like uh because a god we think of a god a god is supposed to be a

3369
06:59:42,760 --> 06:59:48,760
perfect being and it's interesting i think i was like listening to something where it's like it's a

3370
06:59:48,760 --> 06:59:57,080
different type of godhood when you have something imperfect becoming a god for the wrong reasons

3371
06:59:57,160 --> 07:00:05,160
and that's why michela is very like jesus like because you think like oh like michela's feels uh

3372
07:00:05,160 --> 07:00:13,080
feels right now feels obligated to wipe away marica's sin um whatever that was i still

3373
07:00:13,080 --> 07:00:19,160
am unsure what the sin is uh i've seen lots of different things about what the sin could be um

3374
07:00:19,880 --> 07:00:22,520
um and uh

3375
07:00:24,680 --> 07:00:28,760
she'd be speaking from yeah i'm speaking from experience no i was a very good kid i was quiet

3376
07:00:28,760 --> 07:00:34,760
kept my head down i was i was sweet um it seems to be a theme of life wanting to join together yes

3377
07:00:35,400 --> 07:00:41,400
yeah put new ninja because i said the new men were very good for melding things together

3378
07:00:41,960 --> 07:00:49,640
they're like perfect for that um and again i think that comes back to like with the new men

3379
07:00:49,640 --> 07:00:56,120
and uh the horn sent with the jars you think of a spiral uh you could these things twisting

3380
07:00:56,120 --> 07:01:00,680
up each other so it does make sense to why they would they would say that as like a sainthood

3381
07:01:01,480 --> 07:01:07,240
and also because the spiral is heavily inspired um it's a crucible they worship the crucible uh

3382
07:01:07,240 --> 07:01:10,760
they worship the power of the crucible essentially they just see this as a spiral

3383
07:01:10,760 --> 07:01:20,760
same thing and the crucible is just wild uh primordial primeval power um

3384
07:01:22,200 --> 07:01:26,600
and so it makes sense they want everything to be conjoined and wrapped up because they are chaos

3385
07:01:26,600 --> 07:01:33,000
like if you look at a horn sent they are just they don't make any sense they have vestigial

3386
07:01:33,000 --> 07:01:38,440
organs horns limbs on a bunch of other stuff he's interesting to me because he looks pretty

3387
07:01:38,440 --> 07:01:43,720
normal to be honest with you uh he doesn't look like a normal horn like he has a couple of horns

3388
07:01:43,720 --> 07:01:51,640
but he looks fairly normal to me which is interesting he's one of the more humanoid horn sent uh and

3389
07:01:51,640 --> 07:01:55,640
because they're all omen like they're omen they all came from omen and omen came from the crucible

3390
07:01:55,640 --> 07:02:02,920
and stuff um marica's sin is everything come do with god oh she did after but she came one

3391
07:02:02,920 --> 07:02:09,080
yeah exactly uh but i feel like it's more like i feel like there's like when michela talks about

3392
07:02:09,080 --> 07:02:17,080
marica's sin i feel like it's something in particular because he doesn't say sins the sins

3393
07:02:17,080 --> 07:02:24,600
of my mother or the like he said the sin of merit like it's a singular sin and i forget i remember

3394
07:02:24,600 --> 07:02:29,880
listening to what it possibly could be but i can't recall um i might have to like look that up again

3395
07:02:35,000 --> 07:02:38,520
yeah all things came from i were conjoined by the crucible perhaps they thought that

3396
07:02:38,520 --> 07:02:41,560
melding they'll make them a saint because they would be in their mind melded back together

3397
07:02:41,560 --> 07:02:45,560
exactly so i think and i'm just discovering that right now as we're talking about it because i'm

3398
07:02:45,560 --> 07:02:49,480
just like why would they why i was thinking when i was listening to lore and stuff i'm like why are

3399
07:02:49,480 --> 07:02:59,080
they trying to make them saints does it make any sense to me um isn't there like nine

3400
07:03:01,240 --> 07:03:06,920
nine scatter tree blessings or something or like 10 what is this what does that do i don't even know

3401
07:03:06,920 --> 07:03:22,360
what that is um but like it's funny to me that like if the if the genocide of the horn sent

3402
07:03:22,360 --> 07:03:27,000
or the attempt to genocide of the horn sent is what it is her original sin

3403
07:03:30,040 --> 07:03:30,600
it doesn't

3404
07:03:30,760 --> 07:03:39,960
because you gotta think like is it justified because like i get is it really a sin if the greater

3405
07:03:39,960 --> 07:03:45,480
will doesn't care because all the greater will cares about his order the greater will is a seriously

3406
07:03:45,480 --> 07:03:52,680
like in a different god who just wants some sort of order in the world um i'm so glad you're on this

3407
07:03:52,680 --> 07:03:58,440
channel so now here you talk like this is so fun uh 21st god okay um

3408
07:04:03,000 --> 07:04:07,240
her actual first lord maybe that's a good that's a good one um

3409
07:04:10,600 --> 07:04:18,200
and i'm wondering if it's a sin becoming a god as she because she isn't doing she didn't do the

3410
07:04:18,200 --> 07:04:24,440
things that michael is doing so michael is at least shedding his flesh he's becoming he's

3411
07:04:24,440 --> 07:04:30,040
ascending as a spirit he's attaining this higher sense of enlightenment and i feel like maybe

3412
07:04:30,040 --> 07:04:35,640
that's what he means like he was she was sullied he didn't like she like she did do imperfect things

3413
07:04:35,640 --> 07:04:42,040
yes she did do horrible things before um but she went in i feel like i don't recall if she went in

3414
07:04:42,760 --> 07:04:46,760
as a in a fleshly form through the gate um

3415
07:04:50,120 --> 07:04:58,840
uh yeah it wasn't god-free it wasn't god-free wasn't uh yeah um

3416
07:05:02,200 --> 07:05:05,720
but like it seemed like like because they describe it as like a seduction

3417
07:05:06,440 --> 07:05:13,560
and i'm like it's so it's like a manipulation of something or someone or something like and so and

3418
07:05:13,560 --> 07:05:22,040
then again i'm wondering if it's a seduction manipulation of like the entirety of the lands

3419
07:05:22,040 --> 07:05:28,120
between to become a god uh yes i know about me there because i was gonna say you think about

3420
07:05:29,000 --> 07:05:34,040
the fingers and there is a distinct thing about the fingers that says

3421
07:05:35,160 --> 07:05:39,320
the fingers were never like to be trusted in the first place like they've only

3422
07:05:39,320 --> 07:05:44,840
they're kind of doing like the greater will has actually spoilers spoilers everybody spoilers

3423
07:05:44,840 --> 07:05:51,960
the greater will had given up on the lands between america's order and the golden order

3424
07:05:51,960 --> 07:06:02,520
a long ago it was not using the fingers to talk to people like you so the so the um

3425
07:06:03,720 --> 07:06:12,440
the greater will use the fingers as emissaries but the fingers were a c which was a big twist

3426
07:06:12,440 --> 07:06:19,720
i remember losing my mind at this listening to dlc stuff that um because again i'm not the person

3427
07:06:19,720 --> 07:06:25,320
who goes through when i play a game and i look at all the like i would never know any of the stuff

3428
07:06:25,320 --> 07:06:31,160
unless i watch something about it because i don't go and try to grab every new item um

3429
07:06:33,640 --> 07:06:38,440
uh yeah they they stopped having communication before america was even ever became gone and

3430
07:06:38,440 --> 07:06:49,240
then it's interesting because then you think of like uh time is relative thing um time is a very

3431
07:06:49,240 --> 07:06:54,760
interesting thing in the lands between uh people live so long people don't die but even like before

3432
07:06:54,760 --> 07:06:59,400
like the elden ring was shattered and all that stuff and there was death and everything um oh

3433
07:06:59,400 --> 07:07:07,000
hi boomi hey yo he left and came back hi were you checking on rena um boomi maybe you'll forget

3434
07:07:07,000 --> 07:07:13,640
my train of thought with your cuteness uh yeah like and so it's like it's almost like

3435
07:07:14,040 --> 07:07:17,800
like they got a telegram and it was so delayed

3436
07:07:20,440 --> 07:07:26,200
and it was also really cryptic and it's like and it's it's so interesting because then you're

3437
07:07:26,200 --> 07:07:31,240
like oh my god everything we've been doing is a lie then why am i the elden lord like why how

3438
07:07:31,960 --> 07:07:36,200
and it's like it seems like even power is delayed like it seems like the greater world because

3439
07:07:36,200 --> 07:07:43,160
obviously and maybe the greater will views time as something you know

3440
07:07:44,920 --> 07:07:49,400
elden ring morally has more lore than the bible uh i think the elden ring has just as much lore as

3441
07:07:49,400 --> 07:07:57,320
the bible to be honest um there it definitely has its moments i feel like culturally there's a lot

3442
07:07:57,320 --> 07:08:03,720
more lore but spiritually i'd say they're on the same kind of par um just with more of like a

3443
07:08:03,800 --> 07:08:11,640
pantheon of gods or just like uh energies and forces the kami um yeah the greater will believe

3444
07:08:11,640 --> 07:08:15,480
made her uh made her to be cut corrupt which stops communicating which is funny because

3445
07:08:15,480 --> 07:08:21,960
you think because you're like okay but the elden beast then how why why do you fight the elden

3446
07:08:21,960 --> 07:08:29,240
beast and then because the elden beast is also a vassal of the greater will that comes about

3447
07:08:29,800 --> 07:08:34,760
after you defeat radigan uh if he needs an elden ring fungus

3448
07:08:37,000 --> 07:08:40,360
golden order is problematic because based on whims and contrasts what was before

3449
07:08:40,360 --> 07:08:47,000
yes and it's like it's funny because the crucible order or like the order what like were the dragons

3450
07:08:47,800 --> 07:08:54,200
when uh parthenon acts were the i never can remember the dragon's names uh plasuda sacks

3451
07:08:54,760 --> 07:09:01,640
was the elden lord i again i'm so curious as to what god and what order was about when

3452
07:09:01,640 --> 07:09:09,160
plasuda sacks was the elden lord um and what god was he a consort to very very interesting to me

3453
07:09:09,800 --> 07:09:14,120
uh yeah ancient dragon's stone sails they could twist time god that wants to rule them and they

3454
07:09:14,120 --> 07:09:21,560
came yeah that's why i'm like who is this god what is it is the is it the outer god or god of time

3455
07:09:22,280 --> 07:09:29,080
because time is death because again all the outer gods are based on some concept of death

3456
07:09:30,840 --> 07:09:33,800
um the dragons followed a different god yes

3457
07:09:35,640 --> 07:09:47,240
parthenax is from skyrim so oh my god i'm so so leave me alone parthenax plasuda sacks

3458
07:09:48,200 --> 07:09:49,000
uh

3459
07:09:53,000 --> 07:09:56,040
i love skyrim that's why i like elden ring too um

3460
07:09:59,320 --> 07:10:03,640
no i i have marathon a lot of bodies videos but a lot of bodies videos are not up to date

3461
07:10:04,200 --> 07:10:08,920
um i will probably watch the more recent body videos i've been watching a lot of smoke town

3462
07:10:09,800 --> 07:10:16,440
uh because i really like uh his take on things but like yeah the last because the body videos

3463
07:10:16,440 --> 07:10:20,920
he made like two years ago and there's so much more stuff since then and he hasn't updated any of

3464
07:10:20,920 --> 07:10:27,320
the videos he needs to yeah bale i have i know bale's a dragon i'm not super familiar with bale

3465
07:10:27,320 --> 07:10:35,000
though i don't know a lot about um bale's lord dragon never seen yeah and then you think about like

3466
07:10:36,520 --> 07:10:43,880
how dragons have changed like you have this sense of like you see plasuda sacks

3467
07:10:44,600 --> 07:10:54,280
four wings four legs three heads um already have four heads i don't i don't remember but it's at

3468
07:10:54,280 --> 07:10:58,920
first i it's interesting to me because you think of like four wings three heads and like you think

3469
07:10:58,920 --> 07:11:03,400
of the number seven and seven's a very divine number but then you think of the dragons that you

3470
07:11:03,400 --> 07:11:11,080
see like the modern day dragons in the base game and they are essentially wyverns or like i don't

3471
07:11:11,080 --> 07:11:14,840
know what the heck they're called they have two legs and their hands are on their wings

3472
07:11:16,120 --> 07:11:23,560
he had five interesting uh yeah i couldn't remember how many heads he had um but i feel

3473
07:11:23,560 --> 07:11:29,480
like i feel like the number of limbs that plasuda sacks has does have some sort of significance

3474
07:11:29,480 --> 07:11:35,160
four wings four legs five heads like i feel like there's a reason for that um i don't know what it

3475
07:11:35,160 --> 07:11:43,400
is but yeah i feel like how to do maybe with some like i don't know i have to think about that somewhere

3476
07:11:43,400 --> 07:11:50,840
um oh which is he want to be the dragon oh okay yeah there was so you think about like how they

3477
07:11:50,840 --> 07:11:55,720
have degenerated over time and how cultures have changed how evolution has happened and evolution

3478
07:11:55,720 --> 07:12:04,600
takes a very very very long time you think of like the beastman of fair mazula um two and

3479
07:12:04,600 --> 07:12:09,720
how it was like like how they're in a state of suspended time because you think like okay all

3480
07:12:09,720 --> 07:12:13,160
this evolution has happened why haven't they evolved

3481
07:12:17,800 --> 07:12:22,600
and that was the reason plasuda sacks is in his out of time arena and bale still has two

3482
07:12:23,000 --> 07:12:32,040
oh yeah oh because bale's fight i only start for literally like a brief second so i didn't even notice

3483
07:12:32,040 --> 07:12:38,760
that isn't the game lord just theory what are you talking about

3484
07:12:42,760 --> 07:12:47,560
god i can't stay up this is yeah that makes sense that makes sense because he's really

3485
07:12:47,800 --> 07:12:53,960
he he was so powerful that you don't think that godwin could

3486
07:12:55,960 --> 07:13:03,000
you know destroy him the way he did because god was insane that's really cool i didn't even know

3487
07:13:03,000 --> 07:13:10,360
that that's pretty cool actually that's really cool um but yeah i'm super

3488
07:13:10,360 --> 07:13:19,800
super super interested with a bunch of stuff in this game uh like i again i'm a sucker for

3489
07:13:19,800 --> 07:13:28,200
world building i'm a sucker for lore uh georgia martin although he's incredibly annoying because

3490
07:13:28,200 --> 07:13:31,400
you won't finish the rest of the books and probably never will before he dies he probably

3491
07:13:31,400 --> 07:13:39,400
will release it when he dies um he he just hopped on my lap he is such an amazing world

3492
07:13:39,640 --> 07:13:47,720
him and miizaki have made this incredible meld of so many cultures and religions because you have

3493
07:13:47,720 --> 07:13:54,040
like japanese religion and culture and a lot of shintoism um involved and then you have like

3494
07:13:54,040 --> 07:14:01,560
irish english it's so like it really is like as you can hear in my voice i like i geek out so

3495
07:14:01,560 --> 07:14:07,080
hard about it because i'm a sucker for oh sorry i didn't mean to press that um

3496
07:14:08,040 --> 07:14:14,280
um what listen i just want to talk can i talk don't don't be don't madem we got more npcs to

3497
07:14:14,280 --> 07:14:19,800
see and talk i don't care i'm gonna do this for everyone i will go in a tangent after i talk to

3498
07:14:19,800 --> 07:14:26,520
one npc fine i'll talk to him oh my god rena you have a sick helm

3499
07:14:26,520 --> 07:14:41,080
oh aren't you like um yeah radon's lady and you're really sad about radon sick

3500
07:14:44,920 --> 07:14:45,640
dour him

3501
07:14:51,480 --> 07:14:53,800
wait did you have more to say where'd he go

3502
07:14:57,080 --> 07:15:02,600
if michael it is who you would seek these are the sites i urge you follow after

3503
07:15:02,600 --> 07:15:12,360
our dour little friend cool thanks i appreciate it appreciate you follow after michela as long

3504
07:15:12,360 --> 07:15:16,840
as you abide but okay see because like you think of what he just said he's like you'll be no enemy

3505
07:15:16,840 --> 07:15:19,000
to me because you're by me michela but like

3506
07:15:19,800 --> 07:15:25,880
what sets apart what michela is doing but it's little it's literally the master manipulation

3507
07:15:25,880 --> 07:15:32,280
like a freaking michela's powers that just draws in everybody because he's also a freaking maniac

3508
07:15:32,280 --> 07:15:42,840
and he's really no different from his mother he's does it in different ways okay sorry

3509
07:15:49,400 --> 07:15:53,960
egon and bail are based off of cap and ahem and will be no way that's so cool

3510
07:15:55,880 --> 07:16:04,360
i had a moment where i binged a lot of classic literature like um will be dick picture dory and

3511
07:16:04,360 --> 07:16:11,160
gray um because this is because of an extra league of extraordinary gentlemen because i was like

3512
07:16:11,240 --> 07:16:15,080
reading all the books vantals sing all that stuff jackal and hide

3513
07:16:18,440 --> 07:16:23,000
his mother father michela wants everyone to get along he doesn't have them this free will

3514
07:16:28,520 --> 07:16:34,440
what i want to know more of is i want to know more of melina's role in all this because you

3515
07:16:34,440 --> 07:16:42,600
think of like okay uh spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler uh we know that melina and mesmer

3516
07:16:43,240 --> 07:16:51,000
are america's children from radigan uh because you know everybody has freaking red hair um

3517
07:16:51,880 --> 07:16:55,000
and it's interesting to me

3518
07:16:55,240 --> 07:17:04,520
that melina doesn't seem to have the same so like all the children of uh america and radigan

3519
07:17:04,520 --> 07:17:11,960
are cursed because they are born from the same singular god technically and just they're just

3520
07:17:11,960 --> 07:17:19,480
two halves to a whole um which is again like its own like insetuous thing um and that's why it's

3521
07:17:19,480 --> 07:17:26,840
almost like akin to family members doing stuff and like passing something down to their kids

3522
07:17:26,840 --> 07:17:33,800
that could be an issue um and like you think of mesmer who has the abyssal serpent you have

3523
07:17:34,600 --> 07:17:43,240
you know michela being cursed to be the child and then you have um melania being cursed to

3524
07:17:43,240 --> 07:17:51,160
have be a vessel and a vessel of the scarlet rot and become try to be like she has to become the

3525
07:17:51,160 --> 07:17:59,720
goddess of rot and have a order of rot um but yeah um that's what i was gonna say i'm like is melina's

3526
07:17:59,720 --> 07:18:08,280
saying as she does about physical body however you have to think about the past in terms of like

3527
07:18:09,000 --> 07:18:14,760
if you delve into the origins of the godskin apostles uh excuse me by the way i didn't mean to

3528
07:18:14,760 --> 07:18:25,240
burp and you know that you know melina is more than likely the glomide queen she used to have

3529
07:18:25,240 --> 07:18:34,520
some physical form until i forget if it was who was it was a i forget who it was another demigod

3530
07:18:34,520 --> 07:18:38,120
or it was america removed from her body

3531
07:18:42,440 --> 07:18:47,080
and almost like like killed her and destroyed her so she destroyed her physical body because like

3532
07:18:47,080 --> 07:18:56,040
again do themes of duality in elden ring you have a physical body and a spiritual body so

3533
07:18:58,600 --> 07:19:02,120
so michael is able to separate himself from the um straitstrina which makes sense so america and

3534
07:19:02,120 --> 07:19:09,400
radigan can make kids do you have the same hole that could split yes yes yeah yep yep i knew that um

3535
07:19:13,080 --> 07:19:18,680
makes sense radigan fought renola was the meager champion will america use a god yeah

3536
07:19:23,800 --> 07:19:26,440
because i feel like it's like their opposites almost again

3537
07:19:26,680 --> 07:19:33,000
and divine masculine divine feminine this red hair i feel like

3538
07:19:35,080 --> 07:19:38,760
it's weird because you think about america and radigan and so you think of like okay

3539
07:19:40,120 --> 07:19:44,840
there's this parallel of light versus darkness is radigan light

3540
07:19:47,640 --> 07:19:55,800
in america darkness or do or is radigan darkness because of his fervorous attempt

3541
07:19:55,800 --> 07:19:58,200
for the golden order you know

3542
07:20:01,560 --> 07:20:05,320
i'm escaping so much every time i'm talking as she would talk about healer i know me too

3543
07:20:05,320 --> 07:20:10,840
in the same way none of them are like well yeah like everybody it's everybody's morally gray

3544
07:20:11,800 --> 07:20:21,480
here it's very yin and yang yes again another um eastern uh belief system philosophy

3545
07:20:21,560 --> 07:20:24,360
incorporated into the game

3546
07:20:29,400 --> 07:20:32,920
i find it funny how from pot software keeps removing mentions of melina what do you mean

3547
07:20:35,800 --> 07:20:39,800
but i feel i feel like that would be done on purpose in a way that it's like oh my god america

3548
07:20:39,800 --> 07:20:49,080
is removing her because like you don't like you have you obviously know why melina i mean america

3549
07:20:49,080 --> 07:20:55,480
doesn't abandon mesmer because she's scared of his ability with the abyssal serpent

3550
07:20:57,720 --> 07:21:03,320
in this you know serpents are very again there's a lot of parallels to like

3551
07:21:04,920 --> 07:21:09,080
the bible and stuff because serpents are seen as evil like constantly throughout the base game

3552
07:21:09,960 --> 07:21:19,080
um and i i i actually wondered if the the the serpent was the god in um the base game

3553
07:21:20,680 --> 07:21:23,160
uh because you see a lot of like dead serpents and stuff

3554
07:21:26,360 --> 07:21:30,040
radigan is trying to go back to his roots america had a break tries to branch out and move on

3555
07:21:30,600 --> 07:21:41,800
but again my personal opinion is that radigan came to be when america attained her godhood

3556
07:21:41,800 --> 07:21:47,320
i don't think that they were separate people and i feel like that's it's evidence through saint

3557
07:21:48,120 --> 07:21:55,720
michela that once you attain the sort of godhood or close to you have this split

3558
07:21:59,640 --> 07:22:02,920
sister i got removed oh yeah i heard about that but it said like

3559
07:22:04,360 --> 07:22:10,600
now now isn't it more vague now that like his sister also had a vision of fire his younger sister

3560
07:22:10,600 --> 07:22:16,040
they just said it like that or did they remove that line completely because that would be very

3561
07:22:16,040 --> 07:22:23,400
interesting to me yeah serpent is blasphemy but i feel like the serpents more than that like the

3562
07:22:23,400 --> 07:22:29,560
abyssal serpent is a newer well not like a newer but like an outer god and it's very so she like

3563
07:22:29,560 --> 07:22:38,840
you know throw throws him away but why why does she do this with me why does she try to scrub melina

3564
07:22:38,840 --> 07:22:45,080
from everything before because i'm like there must have been a trigger just like how ronnie's just

3565
07:22:45,080 --> 07:22:50,360
like you know like f everything like what cosmolina be like you know what i'm making these gods

3566
07:22:50,360 --> 07:22:59,160
can apostles i'm gonna start destroying everybody the sister mentioned is gone completely really

3567
07:22:59,240 --> 07:23:09,880
really that is so interesting to me

3568
07:23:12,840 --> 07:23:19,000
i generally wonder why that is then they got rid of that whole sister part

3569
07:23:20,840 --> 07:23:25,800
did they think they were giving too much away or did they think they didn't want us to run with

3570
07:23:25,800 --> 07:23:35,400
the melina stuff that is really interesting to me but it's only a finger does in a power

3571
07:23:35,400 --> 07:23:40,680
to communicate to the chaos flame uh right camera call

3572
07:23:44,440 --> 07:23:49,240
what are the three fingers a sort of bad child a meter someone she'd been making the chaos flame

3573
07:23:49,400 --> 07:23:59,240
i don't think i i didn't have to disagree with that because i there is a chaotic frenzied flame god

3574
07:23:59,240 --> 07:24:05,240
outer god so i feel like that's just i do believe that that probably like the three fingers was like

3575
07:24:05,240 --> 07:24:11,080
a black sheep child and it kind of was just like i'm doing my own thing um which does it and it's

3576
07:24:11,080 --> 07:24:17,720
obviously uh there's this thing of like order and independence and like you have to conform um

3577
07:24:20,040 --> 07:24:25,480
and it's interesting that one of the the three fingers didn't want to conform to be part of the hand

3578
07:24:29,880 --> 07:24:33,720
and they got rid of these people but it's like i thought that was a really good tidbit

3579
07:24:33,720 --> 07:24:37,000
the fact that they said like the younger sister also our visions of the flame

3580
07:24:37,960 --> 07:24:43,000
but that's what's good i like the questions the questions make people think that's why i like

3581
07:24:43,000 --> 07:24:45,960
from soft games because a lot of stuff is open-ended just like the map

3582
07:24:47,800 --> 07:24:50,840
i think it's a whole new being once they reach a certain level power they start to achieve the power

3583
07:24:50,840 --> 07:24:54,840
of creation and then be part of themselves into the new being is god of creative life

3584
07:24:55,240 --> 07:25:01,000
i agree with that i agree with that 100

3585
07:25:01,960 --> 07:25:03,000
uh

3586
07:25:05,560 --> 07:25:13,240
i i bet i would totally anticipate in like two years they do another one a dlc just to wrap

3587
07:25:13,240 --> 07:25:19,160
everything up i don't know maybe or they just add like stuff to the game like patches um

3588
07:25:19,960 --> 07:25:26,120
like gate patches not the actual character patches um yeah no she's way more than two fingers

3589
07:25:26,120 --> 07:25:31,800
i like her name is meter like meter because it's like i forget that like means something

3590
07:25:31,800 --> 07:25:38,920
it's like i means like 10 like it's like digits like fingers and so i'm like ah i like it

3591
07:25:41,480 --> 07:25:47,480
personally they said they were done i would not honestly patches is a god patches is a god

3592
07:25:48,440 --> 07:25:52,520
he's bounces around games like he's some like universe hopper

3593
07:25:56,120 --> 07:26:02,360
yeah i love china lord theories too first the fingers is all otherworldly yeah

3594
07:26:07,640 --> 07:26:10,120
yeah or mar or it also can be assigned like with martyr

3595
07:26:14,280 --> 07:26:21,160
yeah again i don't know soldier of god rick yeah i always thought that was silly

3596
07:26:21,160 --> 07:26:26,760
he's also crazy he's the hardest he hardest boss in the game i could never beat him that's why

3597
07:26:26,760 --> 07:26:33,400
like i avoided him when we were playing the base game soldier of god rick no way um again i don't know

3598
07:26:35,480 --> 07:26:39,880
uh i didn't know about dlc stuff just speculating um

3599
07:26:43,560 --> 07:26:48,760
but i feel like i feel like if i like this is the most popular fronts from soft game in a

3600
07:26:48,840 --> 07:26:54,680
like pop one of the most popular games in a very very long time i feel like if another

3601
07:26:54,680 --> 07:27:02,120
people enough people clamored for it they would do something or like surprise people tarnish mortium

3602
07:27:02,120 --> 07:27:11,400
god rick yeah that's why i skipped the beginning cave i'm like why would i put myself in this

3603
07:27:11,400 --> 07:27:21,960
situation just like with the grafted scion you know um but yeah i could literally just sit and

3604
07:27:21,960 --> 07:27:29,960
talk about that for hours because you think of like okay if the greater will does not want to

3605
07:27:29,960 --> 07:27:35,560
and like turned away from the golden order and stuff what is it doing now like what what's up

3606
07:27:35,560 --> 07:27:42,040
what's it waiting for what is it again in a time why do i feel like i don't know which way to go

3607
07:27:42,040 --> 07:27:53,320
i'm gonna go this way first actually um and time is relative and stuff so for this outer this this

3608
07:27:53,320 --> 07:27:58,680
crazy god it probably looked at stuff it was like yeah no i'm not dealing with this and um

3609
07:27:59,000 --> 07:28:07,480
like looked away like 15 minutes is like 15 million years for it oh what's this

3610
07:28:08,840 --> 07:28:12,920
oh okay cool um

3611
07:28:13,480 --> 07:28:14,120
um

3612
07:28:15,880 --> 07:28:22,440
dang this is this is i forget how big this game is gonna be uh crazy dlc

3613
07:28:26,840 --> 07:28:27,320
over

3614
07:28:27,560 --> 07:28:38,040
hmm okay there's more over here

3615
07:28:41,000 --> 07:28:45,640
and there's stuff over okay that's probably where that gate is and that's probably like the first

3616
07:28:46,600 --> 07:28:55,720
thing this might be like dungeon thingy fascinating fascinating i might try to go and get the maps

3617
07:28:55,720 --> 07:29:03,720
because again i'm i'm like that i'm a map girl uh i'll probably cross the bridge and try to get

3618
07:29:03,720 --> 07:29:07,400
through that i don't actually know if this doesn't seem like it'd be a good way to do it

3619
07:29:08,440 --> 07:29:14,680
now i'm looking at this um i might have to cut through whatever this thing is yeah looks like

3620
07:29:14,680 --> 07:29:19,960
there's a way to do it here then go down here and then here and then go up here

3621
07:29:20,920 --> 07:29:25,400
you might do that i'll go check on what these are first uh the crosses with michela

3622
07:29:34,200 --> 07:29:39,880
okay i'm assuming these are them what is this then no because michela's crosses looks is

3623
07:29:40,840 --> 07:29:46,840
decide uh so i don't know why he gave me this map if it's literally just like this and then he

3624
07:29:46,840 --> 07:29:51,960
did like this why did he

3625
07:29:56,760 --> 07:29:57,960
hmm

3626
07:29:59,800 --> 07:30:05,960
oh yeah i know the map is huge

3627
07:30:06,440 --> 07:30:07,080
so

3628
07:30:11,320 --> 07:30:17,480
map goes the cave it's not yet too there's three i've heard there was like great sword katanas

3629
07:30:17,480 --> 07:30:18,680
which is so interesting to me

3630
07:30:24,760 --> 07:30:30,040
the map goes by the cave i said no oh is that what that is oh i thought it was that direction

3631
07:30:36,920 --> 07:30:41,240
hmm well i'll go wherever the wind takes me oh look at grace

3632
07:30:53,880 --> 07:30:57,800
yeah that's why i hated mount trying to get the map near mount gilmere what's over here

What what is that is that the

Was like, what is that?

3689
07:37:07,420 --> 07:37:14,460
Why can I summon spirit ashes here, I'll say the tree looks terrifying in the distance a lot of things look terrifying in the distance

3690
07:37:14,620 --> 07:37:19,300
It's cool. There's waterfalls with everything. That's how things are spaced out even in the base game

3691
07:37:19,300 --> 07:37:21,300
You think there'd be more waterfalls

3692
07:37:28,060 --> 07:37:35,100
Yeah, the area is definitely don't connect like you think they should. Oh, oh, all right, Torrent, that's fine

3693
07:37:36,140 --> 07:37:39,380
You don't have to show up or nothing. That's let's let's say, okay

3694
07:37:45,340 --> 07:37:48,740
Oh, oh, oh anybody in there

3695
07:37:51,380 --> 07:37:54,980
Can I get off my horse piece, I don't know like Torrent just doesn't want to behave

3696
07:37:57,700 --> 07:37:59,700
I

3697
07:38:02,500 --> 07:38:10,980
Sorry about that I'm just gonna do whatever that is get your body off of me with your little weirdy spindly legs

07:38:34,860 --> 07:38:39,060
Sorry, I'm just like skirting around the edge just to see stuff

3701
07:38:41,620 --> 07:38:43,620
Very cool

3702
07:38:44,420 --> 07:38:49,540
What I thought those were something else they look weird for far away why there's like regular eagles here

3703
07:38:49,540 --> 07:38:54,240
That's just so funny to me. They're like, oh, yeah, we came from the top. You know

3704
07:38:54,940 --> 07:38:56,940
Gravebird armor cool

3705
07:38:57,500 --> 07:38:59,500
Don't know what that will do

3706
07:39:00,140 --> 07:39:03,900
Well, I don't know. Oh, that one has bonus rooms, but I don't really care right now

3707
07:39:06,900 --> 07:39:08,900

07:39:37,100 --> 07:39:40,980
Very interesting kind of want to learn more about that and but like cuz you think about like

3714
07:39:41,980 --> 07:39:47,380
Nox Stella and them trying to make their night prince or night king or whatever the heck it's called. I can't remember

3715
07:39:49,300 --> 07:39:51,300
Very cool

3716
07:39:53,500 --> 07:39:55,500
Shadow realm room

3717
07:39:56,340 --> 07:39:58,940
Okay, oh, yeah, they're a different symbol and

3718
07:40:01,700 --> 07:40:03,700
Tarasante

3719
07:40:03,820 --> 07:40:05,820
Where am I?

3720
07:40:06,660 --> 07:40:12,500
Oh looks like I pretty much have to go. Oh back over here

3721
07:40:16,980 --> 07:40:18,980
This carib does work here, okay

3722
07:40:21,300 --> 07:40:24,340
Why am I none cuz I'm holy

3723
07:40:26,500 --> 07:40:30,560
Well when we just stretched and put his paw on my arm, that's very sweet

3724
07:40:35,100 --> 07:40:37,100
Wait a second. Oh

3725
07:40:39,140 --> 07:40:44,860
Yeah, cuz this goes under here so I would need to go this way

3726
07:40:46,380 --> 07:40:48,380
Let's try it. Oh

3727
07:40:48,580 --> 07:40:53,580
My god something. I don't know if a skunk sprayed outside or I don't know if somebody's like I

3728
07:40:54,580 --> 07:41:01,100
Think like my downstairs neighbor is smoking that stuff makes me so nauseous I

3729
07:41:02,060 --> 07:41:04,060
hate that I

3730
07:41:04,700 --> 07:41:06,540
Need to get like those like

3731
07:41:06,540 --> 07:41:12,820
Filter things because I have an air thing. Oh for god that I can't just go straight

3732
07:41:13,420 --> 07:41:15,420
There's a bridge

3733
07:41:15,620 --> 07:41:17,220
I

3734
07:41:17,220 --> 07:41:19,220
Didn't get more of those like air filter things

3735
07:41:19,700 --> 07:41:21,700
I

3736
07:41:23,260 --> 07:41:27,740
Need to change my air filter in my air purifier

3737
07:41:31,100 --> 07:41:36,620
I know boomies literally this is this is this is this is cuteness for us to the month

3738
07:41:38,020 --> 07:41:41,460
Oh surprise like nothing is on this bridge. I'm probably gonna get shot

3739
07:41:42,420 --> 07:41:44,140
Come on

3740
07:41:44,140 --> 07:41:45,740
Where's the trebuchet?

3741
07:41:45,740 --> 07:41:51,860
Where's the giant freaking arrows, where's the flaming balls of fire? Oh, are those are aionian butterflies?

3742
07:41:51,860 --> 07:41:53,860
Oh, no, they're black pyre flies

3743
07:41:54,180 --> 07:41:56,420
Interesting. Oh, there it is. Oh

3744
07:41:58,460 --> 07:42:00,700
I missed I want to pick up everything

3745
07:42:02,420 --> 07:42:04,420
Ballistable, okay

3746
07:42:07,180 --> 07:42:09,180
Hey, what's up? I

3747
07:42:09,740 --> 07:42:17,060
Believe oh, well, I'm gonna get the grace. I believe there's a scato cheese blessing nearby. Oh

3748
07:42:18,460 --> 07:42:21,060
Yep scato cheese fragment

3749
07:42:24,060 --> 07:42:26,060
Can I okay

3750
07:42:31,340 --> 07:42:33,340
Yeah

3751
07:42:33,740 --> 07:42:35,740
You need the fingersling blades

3752
07:42:37,300 --> 07:42:39,300
Yeah, that's a good point actually

3753
07:42:43,140 --> 07:42:45,140
No, I need to

3754
07:42:47,620 --> 07:42:49,620
Sure

3755
07:42:51,260 --> 07:42:55,540
At least it's fine like it's very it's very forgiving if you're on a brand new game

3756
07:42:59,580 --> 07:43:01,580
It's probably be on my horse

3757
07:43:02,580 --> 07:43:04,580
Or not hello, I

3758
07:43:05,820 --> 07:43:07,820
like how like

3759
07:43:07,820 --> 07:43:09,660
It's very interesting

3760
07:43:09,660 --> 07:43:15,300
Because you kind of when you're playing as like the tarnish and you're in enemy camps and stuff

3761
07:43:15,580 --> 07:43:19,860
You kind of see them as like heathens, but then you kind of you go into it like oh really?

3762
07:43:19,860 --> 07:43:24,820
Oh, it is implied that people sat here and ate this table, but you never really think about that

3763
07:43:25,820 --> 07:43:28,300
As far as nobody's coming out of the tent just like

3764
07:43:28,940 --> 07:43:30,340
ripping me a new one

3765
07:43:30,340 --> 07:43:34,940
Like they had people that set up the tent and like to get food and then people will set up all these pikes

3766
07:43:35,820 --> 07:43:38,060
Must smell like terrible around here

3767
07:43:40,140 --> 07:43:42,140
What is I just real oh

3768
07:43:43,180 --> 07:43:49,140
Yeah, and it's like interesting cuz America's beheaded and you think about like I feel like this is a what the heck

3769
07:43:49,940 --> 07:43:51,940
I'm just shaking. Can I do that again?

3770
07:43:52,620 --> 07:43:54,620
Maybe that again come on

3771
07:43:54,820 --> 07:43:56,820
do it I

3772
07:43:56,980 --> 07:43:58,980
was saying I

3773
07:44:00,940 --> 07:44:08,980
Was thinking of like how this kind of reminds me to have how a lot of Egyptian statues were defaced and like their noses cut off and like

3774
07:44:09,220 --> 07:44:11,220
Certain features were cut off

3775
07:44:11,740 --> 07:44:12,940
I

3776
07:44:12,940 --> 07:44:15,660
Believe I think somebody said that it's like mesmer

3777
07:44:16,380 --> 07:44:19,100
Cut off all the heads of the America statues a careful

3778
07:44:20,460 --> 07:44:23,900
All right. Hey, bye. I don't really feel like fighting you

3779
07:44:25,820 --> 07:44:31,980
I know there's another scot-o-tree thing around here somewhere. I

3780
07:44:33,420 --> 07:44:35,420
Know it

3781
07:44:35,500 --> 07:44:37,500
Have a vague feeling

3782
07:44:38,020 --> 07:44:43,380
So they remember watching a video briefly if somebody was running through and they happened to run through something

3783
07:44:43,940 --> 07:44:48,900
That looked like a camp like this and there is a scot-o-tree fragment. Oh

3784
07:44:50,700 --> 07:44:53,340
That was a review don't just shot at my face

3785
07:44:55,100 --> 07:44:58,940
Oh, that's a cool-looking dog terrifying, but cool

3786
07:45:00,580 --> 07:45:02,580
Oh, hey you

3787
07:45:03,060 --> 07:45:09,900
Perfumers. Oh, yeah, I never got the idea of perfumers. I never used anything that perfumers had

3788
07:45:11,140 --> 07:45:14,660
Is anything in here? No. Oh, I'm gonna die. I don't want to get hurt

3789
07:45:16,340 --> 07:45:20,820
Cuz about not the bosses, but like the things are very unforgiving. Oh

3790
07:45:21,820 --> 07:45:26,180
Oh, you look intense. Oh, yeah. Yeah, you are. Oh, oh

3791
07:45:28,260 --> 07:45:32,580
Oh, please. Oh, please don't kill me. I can't see past this stupid dialogue box

3792
07:45:39,060 --> 07:45:43,660
Don't mind me. I am just crashing through your camp looking for stuff to seal

3793
07:45:44,660 --> 07:45:48,580
Nothing major. Don't worry about it. Stop

3794
07:45:50,900 --> 07:45:57,460
It's very rude. I'm just trying to steal stuff. Oh my god. It's a freaking dog. Oh, what's that? I don't know. I need a sneeze

3795
07:46:03,220 --> 07:46:06,340
Like how you just have a dead person in there. I mean not gonna hit by that torch

3796
07:46:07,860 --> 07:46:09,860
Hello

3797
07:46:10,340 --> 07:46:12,340
How I don't even know what I got hit with

3798
07:46:15,700 --> 07:46:17,700
Thank you

3799
07:46:21,780 --> 07:46:26,020
Perfumes are cool because like I just never saw the point of them because again, they're very late game

3800
07:46:26,420 --> 07:46:29,460
Because it doesn't tell really until like the alt is plateau

3801
07:46:31,060 --> 07:46:33,060
Uh, you deal with like perfumers

3802
07:46:33,540 --> 07:46:38,820
But like I don't I'll be honest. I don't really know what they're for like the perfumes. Where's my stuff over there?

3803
07:46:39,700 --> 07:46:41,700
I know it's only like 20k, but

3804
07:46:42,100 --> 07:46:44,100
Girls gotta do what a girl's gotta do

3805
07:46:44,500 --> 07:46:47,140
I also feel like there's more to explore. This is really cool camp

3806
07:46:47,940 --> 07:46:50,100
Uh, where's my stuff over here?

3807
07:46:51,780 --> 07:46:56,260
Guys have what's the symbol? These are mesmer soldiers, aren't they? I believe

3808
07:46:57,220 --> 07:46:58,580
I take that

3809
07:46:58,580 --> 07:47:03,380
Nope. Nope. You're not doing it. You're not doing it. You're not shooting me with no stupid stuff

3810
07:47:05,220 --> 07:47:09,860
Uh, what there's another one around here. Okay, that I'm assuming there's nothing here for me

3811
07:47:10,660 --> 07:47:12,660
So I will leave this said camp

3812
07:47:14,340 --> 07:47:16,500
I wonder what they feed those dogs. Oh my god

3813
07:47:18,180 --> 07:47:20,180
The dog is worthless

3814
07:47:20,820 --> 07:47:22,820
I need to scratch my ear

3815
07:47:27,140 --> 07:47:29,140
Buffs an aoe. Okay

3816
07:47:29,940 --> 07:47:31,940
Because then I would just get because like I just

3817
07:47:32,100 --> 07:47:36,020
Because again, a lot of this stuff just looks like nightmaid it's miss or like poison miss and stuff. So

3818
07:47:36,820 --> 07:47:38,820
Let's come down here

3819
07:47:39,380 --> 07:47:41,380
Brassels green and the girl

3820
07:47:43,780 --> 07:47:45,780
Or do you have anything in here? No

3821
07:47:46,100 --> 07:47:49,620
Come on guys. You guys don't have anything for me to steal over here

3822
07:47:51,540 --> 07:47:53,060
Really?

3823
07:47:53,060 --> 07:47:55,780
Why are you even here then if I can't steal anything from you?

3824
07:47:58,820 --> 07:48:01,060
Run away from the dog run away from the dog run away from this dog

3825
07:48:01,700 --> 07:48:03,700
What does it do? I wasn't shooting at me

3826
07:48:04,340 --> 07:48:06,340
I don't know. Run away from the dog. What is that?

3827
07:48:07,460 --> 07:48:09,460
What is happening over here?

3828
07:48:10,420 --> 07:48:12,340
What is that?

3829
07:48:12,340 --> 07:48:15,620
What are y'all beating a knight? Okay. Well, I'm gonna run away

3830
07:48:17,780 --> 07:48:20,420
Y'all are just beating on each other. What are those are the omen?

3831
07:48:21,780 --> 07:48:25,540
Are they horn set? I don't know. Cool. Um

3832
07:48:26,980 --> 07:48:28,980
There's a cave. Oh cave

3833
07:48:29,620 --> 07:48:31,620
Oh cave

3834
07:48:32,180 --> 07:48:35,060
Oh, what's in the cave? Where am I?

3835
07:48:36,660 --> 07:48:38,660
Hit the graze

3836
07:48:41,620 --> 07:48:43,620
Oh

3837
07:48:44,900 --> 07:48:48,820
I feel like I should be having some fire resistant armor

3838
07:48:49,780 --> 07:48:52,020
Actually, what was the armor that I picked up?

3839
07:48:55,700 --> 07:48:58,500
I picked up something

3840
07:49:00,180 --> 07:49:02,180
Not that. Um

3841
07:49:04,660 --> 07:49:07,620
That looks crazy. No, it wasn't that it was

3842
07:49:09,860 --> 07:49:11,860
Grave bird armor

3843
07:49:13,300 --> 07:49:15,300
Oh

3844
07:49:15,300 --> 07:49:20,500
I'm just farming rune standing right here. I bet you could literally farm rune sitting here and just like

3845
07:49:22,180 --> 07:49:24,180
Although it's 2000 so it's not that much

3846
07:49:25,780 --> 07:49:27,780
But still pretty cool

3847
07:49:36,420 --> 07:49:38,420
Oh gotta put on my effects hold on

3848
07:49:46,260 --> 07:49:48,260
Hold on let me try

3849
07:49:57,380 --> 07:50:05,380
By grace have I ever seen of the rock? I shall find it of this I have no doubt

3850
07:50:08,340 --> 07:50:10,820
The altar of the forge cannot be for

3851
07:50:11,780 --> 07:50:14,580
Whatever the frick that means

3852
07:50:16,340 --> 07:50:22,180
Putting the VA and velar baby. I need to probably sit down. I need to take a seat. I'm tired

3853
07:50:24,980 --> 07:50:26,980
Bird is better for farm

3854
07:50:28,580 --> 07:50:30,740
Bop-bop-bop. I'll probably look really funny. Hold on

3855
07:50:36,340 --> 07:50:38,740
What does it do? It's gonna be lightning

3856
07:50:40,900 --> 07:50:42,900
I

3857
07:50:47,060 --> 07:50:49,060
Drops my poise

3858
07:50:55,220 --> 07:50:57,220
Oh

3859
07:51:06,180 --> 07:51:08,180
Sorry it's like that noise

3860
07:51:11,220 --> 07:51:17,140
I don't really do jump attacks though. You guys haven't seen me do one jump attack

3861
07:51:22,100 --> 07:51:26,900
Really isn't better than mogwin interesting. I feel like you might have done that on purpose

3862
07:51:28,980 --> 07:51:32,020
Anyways, what's down here? Hello? What the heck?

3863
07:51:34,740 --> 07:51:36,740
Oh what

3864
07:51:38,740 --> 07:51:40,740
Okay

3865
07:51:41,060 --> 07:51:43,060
Uh

3866
07:51:43,380 --> 07:51:45,380
Hit them where the week is

3867
07:51:46,900 --> 07:51:48,900
What oh and they're booty cheeks

3868
07:51:50,820 --> 07:51:56,580
Is this I thought that was a monster um, okay hold on let me get behind you

07:52:54,900 --> 07:52:56,900
More to this but you know what?

3878
07:52:58,420 --> 07:53:00,740
Oh, this is a trap surely

3879
07:53:02,500 --> 07:53:04,500
No, all right

3880
07:53:06,340 --> 07:53:08,340

There's this gas stone. Haha. That was me earlier

3884
07:53:23,780 --> 07:53:25,780

07:53:33,140 --> 07:53:35,140
Oh, what's that?

3892
07:53:56,900 --> 07:54:01,300
Oh, you're a big fella, aren't you? This is probably a somber knocks regularly

3893
07:54:03,460 --> 07:54:06,500
Oh, I need heal. Oh, what's that?

3894
07:54:09,700 --> 07:54:11,700
Okay

3895
07:54:12,100 --> 07:54:14,100

Get three knives, okay

3897
07:54:22,980 --> 07:54:30,580
Yeah, I I am kind of confused why an end game DLC is doing ones and twos but you know, I thought I was just going to be like sombers

3898
07:54:32,900 --> 07:54:38,420
Because let's be honest the only thing that people are living up is like Uchigatana

3899
07:54:41,700 --> 07:54:43,700
I

3900
07:54:53,940 --> 07:54:55,940
Miss anything when I was running through here

3901
07:54:57,940 --> 07:55:02,260
Sometimes I have really bad eyesight and I can't tell oh what's over here

3902
07:55:04,100 --> 07:55:09,380
Oh, you missed oh, I like how they're just staring at stuff and I was like bye

3903
07:55:12,100 --> 07:55:16,660
Sorry gotta go gotta blast

3904
07:55:22,820 --> 07:55:29,300
Okay, let's try this again. You could definitely sneak past these guys if you really wanted to oh, it's cool

3905
07:55:30,980 --> 07:55:32,260
Is that it?

3906
07:55:32,260 --> 07:55:38,100
It seems like it's it. Is there a way to jump up there? There's definitely more to explore here. Ow

3907
07:55:42,260 --> 07:55:44,260
I

3908
07:55:45,860 --> 07:55:48,500
Definitely I'm gonna climb this ladder

3909
07:55:52,420 --> 07:55:55,540
Something's probably gonna shoot me. Can I get on the ladder?

3910
07:56:03,060 --> 07:56:06,500
Poco yeah, there's definitely some parkour to be had oh

3911
07:56:08,660 --> 07:56:10,660
Um

3912
07:56:11,940 --> 07:56:13,940

07:56:47,620 --> 07:56:51,700
Love like when you place from soft games enough you just realize you don't have to do everything

3918
07:56:52,420 --> 07:56:54,820

07:57:16,980 --> 07:57:18,980
Is that gonna go on the lava?

3925
07:57:19,940 --> 07:57:21,940
Um, can you not be so close to that?

3926
07:57:24,020 --> 07:57:28,740

Is this just a loop around

3936
07:58:02,420 --> 07:58:04,420
Am I supposed to go higher?

3937
07:58:04,420 --> 07:58:06,420
Something tells me I am

3938
07:58:06,420 --> 07:58:08,420

Wait, I don't want to see what that looks like though

3963
07:59:59,620 --> 08:00:01,620
What the heck that doesn't make any sense

3964
08:00:02,420 --> 08:00:04,420
Oh

3965
08:00:08,420 --> 08:00:10,420

3968
08:00:29,060 --> 08:00:31,060
Oh

3969
08:00:31,780 --> 08:00:34,900
Thank you for the compliment. I'm happy you're enjoying watching

Hammer time. What does a hammer do? Is that a is that a weapon?

08:00:43,700 --> 08:00:48,500
This is cool. It's a throwing blade interesting. What?

3972
08:00:51,380 --> 08:00:53,380
What the heck

3973

08:01:08,580 --> 08:01:10,580
I don't think I

3976
08:01:10,900 --> 08:01:11,860
Oh

3977
08:01:11,860 --> 08:01:16,900
Pretty cool though. Oh, we like sticking out his toesies. Uh, let me change this back

3978
08:01:18,260 --> 08:01:20,900
I'm never really like colossal weapons because they move. Oops

3979
08:01:21,860 --> 08:01:23,860
Because they move so slow to me

3980
08:01:25,380 --> 08:01:30,740
I don't like I like I like being having speed. I am speed

3981
08:01:34,900 --> 08:01:38,420
There's a throwing hammer. No, wait, wait, I'm going the wrong way

3982
08:01:38,420 --> 08:01:40,420
Oh

3983
08:01:48,820 --> 08:01:54,100
Oh, thank you average amphibian for the five gifts. Did you guys are so sweet today with your gifted?

Why you guys being so sweet? Why do we deserve this boomy is touching my

3985
08:02:00,260 --> 08:02:06,020
Is this like placing his paws on my arm as he stretches. That's cute. Hi pretty bull

All right, I think I oh wait, there's more

3987
08:02:12,500 --> 08:02:15,620
I'm like, I think I'd thoroughly discovered this side. That's incorrect

3988
08:02:17,300 --> 08:02:22,260
That is incorrect. So why you guys all fighting? No fighting Shakira Shakira

3989
08:02:23,140 --> 08:02:25,140
Those are things from the sewers

3990
08:02:25,700 --> 08:02:27,060
I can't really tell

3991
08:02:27,060 --> 08:02:29,060
Something chasing me

3992
08:02:29,460 --> 08:02:31,460
No, you're just walking slowly towards me

3993
08:02:32,500 --> 08:02:36,820
You approach me. Oh, I thought this was entrance to a cave for some reason because of the shadow

3994
08:02:37,780 --> 08:02:39,780
Um

3995
08:02:40,340 --> 08:02:47,300
Oh, what's that poison nice. Is there anything of use in the poison lake?

3996
08:02:56,020 --> 08:02:58,020
Let's skirt the edge

3997
08:02:58,020 --> 08:03:08,580
Yeah, you don't have to tell me the viewer count I prefer not to know but thank you

3998
08:03:16,260 --> 08:03:23,780
What's over here? Oh, what? Hold on. I'm confused

3999
08:03:28,820 --> 08:03:30,820
Okay

4000
08:03:34,100 --> 08:03:40,100
Oh you what the heck? Oh, I thought it was something else. It didn't look like it had a tail

4001
08:03:53,620 --> 08:03:56,420
Okay, now I see something possibly of value

4002
08:03:58,340 --> 08:04:02,900
Isn't that right? I don't know what the heck this is

4003
08:04:05,700 --> 08:04:12,100
Co I forget that torrent is fine and poison because torrent's just a bad ad be

I'm literally just doing the most right now what I should be doing

4006
08:04:23,780 --> 08:04:25,780
Oh

4007
08:04:25,780 --> 08:04:27,780
Oh, oh what there's rats here

08:06:30,500 --> 08:06:32,500
Is that a boulder?

4037
08:06:33,300 --> 08:06:35,300
What is this?

4038
08:06:35,940 --> 08:06:37,940
What is that?

4039
08:06:38,100 --> 08:06:40,100
What am I supposed to do with this?

4040
08:06:42,420 --> 08:06:44,420
Can I hit it

4041
08:06:45,060 --> 08:06:47,060
Can I destroy this? Oh

4042
08:06:55,940 --> 08:06:57,940
Okay

4043
08:07:01,380 --> 08:07:03,380
You know what's weird

4044
08:07:03,780 --> 08:07:05,780
I feel like they shouldn't

4045
08:07:06,820 --> 08:07:11,860
Show the wind because I thought it was working fine. Again. I didn't try to jump in it though

4046
08:07:12,020 --> 08:07:15,860
So maybe if you try to jump in it, you wouldn't nothing would happen. That's

4047
08:07:16,900 --> 08:07:20,980
Okay, I like how it's like somewhere. Oh, you can clearly see where

4048
08:07:27,060 --> 08:07:29,300
Oh, oh here it is

4049
08:07:33,060 --> 08:07:37,460
Tailsman of the dread that looks like a badass tailsman

4050
08:07:38,900 --> 08:07:40,900
Uh, I want to see what it does

4051
08:07:42,820 --> 08:07:44,820
Do you believe I don't use magma?

4052
08:07:50,740 --> 08:07:54,420
Oh pale tyrant drake do your wounds yet ache

4053
08:07:56,260 --> 08:07:59,460
Is your fury still yet to crest at sena?

4054
08:08:01,620 --> 08:08:04,820
Very hurry and lay it all to waste

4055
08:08:04,980 --> 08:08:12,420
Lay waste to the proud that conceded each every last one of the arrogant lot

4056
08:08:16,500 --> 08:08:18,500
I'm assuming that's where bail is

4057
08:08:24,100 --> 08:08:26,100
You're mine. Haha. I got you

4058
08:08:27,940 --> 08:08:31,540
Nipi oh, I almost fell off. Uh, let's not do that

4059
08:08:32,500 --> 08:08:34,500
All these burned down

4060
08:08:35,540 --> 08:08:37,220
places

4061
08:08:37,220 --> 08:08:40,260
worn out faces burned down places

4062
08:08:42,020 --> 08:08:45,060
That definitely leads somewhere. I think that leads to the

4063
08:08:46,020 --> 08:08:52,020
Probably the woods where you fight that sunflower monster kind of looks like that I've seen

4064
08:08:53,060 --> 08:08:55,060
Sorry sheep

4065

08:09:17,860 --> 08:09:20,740
I see I probably need to unseal that because it looks weird

4070
08:09:21,620 --> 08:09:25,060
Do I it's like purple is there pile of rocks in it? No

4071
08:09:26,980 --> 08:09:28,980

What's down here? I feel like oh, let's go up here because I feel like I'm gonna work my way down

4131
08:15:08,500 --> 08:15:10,500
La la la

4132
08:15:10,580 --> 08:15:15,940
Oh, why are you? What are you doing do gem? I don't know what that is sounds cool though

4133
08:15:17,700 --> 08:15:19,700
I feel like there's a side of grace somewhere

4134
08:15:20,340 --> 08:15:21,780
Oh

4135
08:15:21,780 --> 08:15:23,780
No, I'm good. Um

08:15:27,140 --> 08:15:29,140
I'm

We're just doing some exploring. Oh, yeah, there's a grace right here. Ta-da

4139
08:15:39,540 --> 08:15:43,060
What do I hear in the distance that sounds like it's something that's gonna come in and land

4140
08:15:46,100 --> 08:15:48,100
Found a mini boss

4141
08:15:50,340 --> 08:15:54,260
All right, oh it's him that's making noise. Uh, I'll go fight them in a second

4142
08:15:54,660 --> 08:15:57,620
Let me go fight this dude that I found the grace. I'm surprised

4143
08:15:58,260 --> 08:16:04,500
This boss must not be forgiving if there are two graces so close to each other like this that are not really bad

4144
08:16:04,660 --> 08:16:06,660
Oh, yeah, you're crucible

4145
08:16:06,980 --> 08:16:10,260
You're a crucible dude, aren't you you're a little you're a little crucible boy

4146
08:16:11,140 --> 08:16:17,460
Oh, you can come outside. I don't like that. Uh, I'm gonna leave. I love your twin blades though. That's real cool

4147
08:16:18,420 --> 08:16:21,460
Real cool. Uh, really like your twin blades

4148
08:16:22,420 --> 08:16:26,580
Like your breastplate you're really nice breastplate

4149
08:16:29,860 --> 08:16:31,860
Oh, I'm glad you've been enjoying it

4150
08:16:33,700 --> 08:16:39,460
I like it's uh spending time with you too. Very good way for me to also decompress just nice, you know

4151
08:16:43,300 --> 08:16:47,780
Oh, they were nice enough to put the runes too far away. All right, let's see. What if I

4152
08:16:51,540 --> 08:16:53,540
Oh, okay, that doesn't do anything

4153
08:16:57,060 --> 08:17:00,580
What if I can I lock him out there so he stays there while I wait for him to do that

4154
08:17:01,700 --> 08:17:03,700
Oh, nope. Come outside

4155
08:17:03,780 --> 08:17:05,780
Nope

4156
08:17:13,860 --> 08:17:17,380
Can I oh you're gonna kill me. No, okay

4157
08:17:17,380 --> 08:17:21,700
Okay, no you're not gonna kill me

4158
08:17:24,900 --> 08:17:26,900
Oh, you're gonna kill me

4159
08:17:29,940 --> 08:17:31,940
I can kind of break

4160
08:17:37,220 --> 08:17:40,580
I feel like I should be able to break his poise. Uh, I've only found

4161
08:17:42,740 --> 08:17:44,900
I've only found one scatter tree

4162
08:17:45,540 --> 08:17:47,540
Fragment

4163
08:17:50,100 --> 08:17:53,940
Uh, well, I have like I have one other one, but I need two to go to the next one, you know

4164
08:17:59,140 --> 08:18:01,300
All right, let's uh, what else can I do?

4165
08:18:03,700 --> 08:18:06,100
Oh, is rock sling effective for you?

4166
08:18:12,740 --> 08:18:14,740
Whoa

4167
08:18:14,900 --> 08:18:16,900
I

4168
08:18:17,780 --> 08:18:20,900
Was hoping I could trap you in this corner doesn't seem like it'll be the case

4169
08:18:23,860 --> 08:18:26,020
I can kill you

4170
08:18:26,020 --> 08:18:31,140
I feel like you either give me your blades or you give me your armor set and I kind of want either one

4171
08:18:31,940 --> 08:18:33,940
So let's do it

4172
08:18:35,300 --> 08:18:38,980
Go go flying rock the comet was more effective

4173
08:18:45,380 --> 08:18:48,420
I like how he's just like hanging out. He's like, yeah, I can't really jump that

4174
08:18:48,420 --> 08:18:50,580
So I guess you're cool to like try to fight that dude

4175
08:18:51,300 --> 08:18:56,020
It'd be funny if I could get him to aggro this guy. That'd be funny. Um, maybe I can

4176
08:18:56,660 --> 08:19:00,740
Pop off a couple of glint blades. Maybe

4177
08:19:03,140 --> 08:19:05,140
Oh, we'll see

4178
08:19:14,900 --> 08:19:16,900
I

4179
08:19:21,140 --> 08:19:23,140
Didn't really do anything

4180
08:19:25,300 --> 08:19:27,300
Whoa, what the heck is happening to my camera?

4181
08:19:29,540 --> 08:19:34,580
Oh, fuck. Oh, can you chill out for a second? Kind of let me breathe. Can I breathe? Can I breathe? No

4182
08:19:35,460 --> 08:19:37,460
All right, we're not gonna do that

4183
08:19:39,940 --> 08:19:43,140
Why did you spoil that I get his Crucible Wings is national war

4184
08:19:45,220 --> 08:19:47,220
You

4185
08:19:51,380 --> 08:19:55,460
Don't tell me because now I don't care about beating him

4186
08:19:58,500 --> 08:20:00,500
Well, maybe I do

4187
08:20:02,740 --> 08:20:04,740
The blessings location, uh

4188
08:20:06,180 --> 08:20:08,100
No

4189
08:20:08,100 --> 08:20:10,100
I prefer I want to

4190
08:20:10,100 --> 08:20:14,100
DLC, uh, I'm not going to do what I did with the trying to get through the base game

4191
08:20:14,900 --> 08:20:16,900
Don't knock me off. Um

4192
08:20:21,380 --> 08:20:24,820
I literally just want to oh common soldier

4193
08:20:26,260 --> 08:20:30,580
Uh, I just want to explore and have fun. That's why I said I might not make this

4194
08:20:32,820 --> 08:20:34,100
Like a

4195
08:20:34,100 --> 08:20:37,620
I only play this and when I stream series because I don't know if

4196
08:20:38,660 --> 08:20:40,980
Is there not a ladder here? I don't

4197
08:20:41,700 --> 08:20:43,700
Is it a lift?

4198
08:20:44,020 --> 08:20:46,660
Is there a hole? It looks like there's a hole if I

4199
08:20:48,260 --> 08:20:50,260
Yeah, nice try

4200
08:20:51,860 --> 08:20:53,380
Um

4201
08:20:53,380 --> 08:20:55,860
Why is this looks like a boss arena when I know it's not?

4202
08:20:56,980 --> 08:21:02,180
That doesn't make any sense. Um, I'm gonna creep around him. Let's see what else we got over here

4203
08:21:05,460 --> 08:21:07,540
Because I think I think that's just fun, you know

4204
08:21:10,020 --> 08:21:13,540
Oh, there's something interesting in front of them though. Oh, you didn't see me

4205
08:21:13,700 --> 08:21:18,100
You didn't see me. You didn't see me. You didn't see nothing. You didn't see nothing. Am I here?

4206
08:21:19,780 --> 08:21:21,780
Sneak increased

4207
08:21:22,020 --> 08:21:24,020
Okay, fine. Well

4208
08:21:29,700 --> 08:21:32,020
It's great because I like it tricks their dodge

4209
08:21:39,860 --> 08:21:41,860
Oh

4210
08:21:43,940 --> 08:21:45,940
Oh

4211
08:21:51,460 --> 08:21:54,020
Come on give me that blood. Oh, you're gonna kill me

4212
08:21:55,940 --> 08:21:58,580
Looks like he just cracked his neck before he did that. That was kind of cool

4213
08:22:08,820 --> 08:22:10,820
What

4214
08:22:11,780 --> 08:22:13,780
Or you

4215
08:22:17,620 --> 08:22:22,020
He should have died he should have died he should I got a little bit greedy

4216
08:22:22,820 --> 08:22:24,820
But he should have died

4217
08:22:24,820 --> 08:22:28,980
Come on. I know it. You know it. We all know it. He should have died

4218
08:22:38,500 --> 08:22:40,500
It's hard to break his poise though

4219
08:22:41,780 --> 08:22:43,780
All right

4220
08:22:56,740 --> 08:23:03,140
Would you drop he said nah, I win. What are these blessed bones charts?

4221
08:23:05,860 --> 08:23:07,860
May I break this

4222
08:23:08,660 --> 08:23:10,660
Disrespect your surroundings

4223
08:23:10,980 --> 08:23:12,980
No, is there anything in there? I don't know

4224
08:23:24,660 --> 08:23:26,660
Oh, I'm assuming this is where you come from

4225
08:23:27,540 --> 08:23:33,380
I don't know why the flames scared me for a second. Uh, the crackling was just unnerving. Uh, where am I?

4226
08:23:35,300 --> 08:23:37,700
I don't know where I am. I almost fell off the cliff

4227
08:23:41,460 --> 08:23:44,420
But I'm gonna go back in there and explore some more

4228
08:23:48,580 --> 08:23:51,380
Bring you back to Bloodborne. Uh, I'm not

4229
08:23:55,300 --> 08:23:59,620
Okay randomly aggro dragon what's happening over there

4230
08:24:04,580 --> 08:24:07,700
Now I'm tempted to go look to see what the heck this dragon is fighting

4231
08:24:11,220 --> 08:24:13,220
You

4232
08:24:18,660 --> 08:24:20,660
What the hell is that?

4233
08:24:28,020 --> 08:24:30,020
Is the sentinel gonna fight it

4234
08:24:34,180 --> 08:24:40,660
Because I'm just gonna sit and just like third party this crap this guy can't it's trying to run away and he can't

4235
08:24:40,900 --> 08:24:46,980
That's too sad. He's just stuck. That's a shame that guy is trying to shoot it

4236
08:24:52,260 --> 08:24:54,260
Oh

4237
08:24:58,500 --> 08:25:04,020
Very cool looking dragon, I will say yeah, what the heck? Oh, I'm just gonna sit here and watch

4238
08:25:06,100 --> 08:25:08,500
Oh my god, that one has a hammer. That's terrifying

4239
08:25:09,460 --> 08:25:11,460
Would not want to mess with that guy

4240
08:25:14,900 --> 08:25:22,020
I'm surprised that these soldiers not really doing any damage. Whoa. I like how it attacks and landed in the air

4241
08:25:24,980 --> 08:25:29,940
Like that like that that dragon is not affected one bit

4242
08:25:31,700 --> 08:25:37,060
I will gladly take all these ruins from you killing everybody though. It's very fun to watch

4243
08:25:38,820 --> 08:25:43,060
I'm gonna start commentating this. Oh, I'm getting too close

4244
08:25:45,060 --> 08:25:47,060
Uh, I am retreating for safety

4245
08:25:47,620 --> 08:25:52,820
Uh, the ghost flame dragon is wrecking these boys. Uh, they've only done a hundred damage

4246
08:25:54,180 --> 08:25:58,420
They're bringing up the rear. They're really ganging up on him though because it looks like

4247
08:25:59,940 --> 08:26:01,940
Some of them did lay down

4248
08:26:02,020 --> 08:26:05,060
Some sort of a aoe not quite sure if there's a

4249
08:26:05,540 --> 08:26:09,140
Perfume or among them, but I see some sparkles. Uh, I'm going to run away

4250
08:26:10,820 --> 08:26:12,820
I'm running away

4251
08:26:13,380 --> 08:26:15,140
Uh, I'm not a part of this

4252
08:26:15,140 --> 08:26:17,940
I'm just a commentator. Uh, I'm live on the street

4253
08:26:18,500 --> 08:26:20,340
Watching this dragon

4254
08:26:20,340 --> 08:26:22,020
Not aggroing it

4255
08:26:22,020 --> 08:26:24,020
He has really cool feathery stuff

4256
08:26:24,900 --> 08:26:29,140
Oh god, no, I'm not a part of this. I'm leaving

4257
08:26:31,380 --> 08:26:33,380
Go fight them not me

4258
08:26:36,020 --> 08:26:38,820
Perfect. Okay, we're going back on to the field boys

4259
08:26:40,020 --> 08:26:42,020
The dragon has not noticed me

4260
08:26:42,740 --> 08:26:46,900
Everybody's kind of dangerously close. They've still only done like a hundred damage

4261
08:26:49,300 --> 08:26:51,300
Very cool

4262
08:26:51,380 --> 08:26:53,380
I'm live in the action

4263
08:26:54,820 --> 08:26:59,140
This horse guy with the hammer you'd think would be doing a lot more damage, but it doesn't seem to be the case

4264
08:26:59,540 --> 08:27:01,540
Oh slams down on them

4265
08:27:01,540 --> 08:27:03,540
I

4266
08:27:04,980 --> 08:27:07,300
Doesn't just eat those arrows. Oh his

4267
08:27:08,420 --> 08:27:10,900
Undead drugguses in my face

4268
08:27:11,700 --> 08:27:15,620
I really don't like that. I can see through that. That's uncomfortable

4269
08:27:19,300 --> 08:27:24,180
Yeah, it's a zombie dragon. I wonder why that is it's just called ghost flame dragon

4270
08:27:26,740 --> 08:27:28,740
Oh, I got knocked

4271
08:27:28,900 --> 08:27:32,020
Nice stagger keep going for it. Don't come over here

4272
08:27:33,140 --> 08:27:36,580
I could probably kill this dragon. I could help him out. Maybe

4273
08:27:37,780 --> 08:27:39,780
Do a little cheeky heal

4274
08:27:40,340 --> 08:27:42,340
Do a little

4275
08:27:42,500 --> 08:27:45,060
Do a little cheeky like, you know, like a little cheeky

4276
08:27:45,860 --> 08:27:47,860
A little cheeky comet

4277
08:27:48,660 --> 08:27:50,660
A little cheeky glimstone

4278
08:27:51,620 --> 08:27:53,620
Oh

4279
08:27:55,220 --> 08:27:58,740
Assistance. Oh, I didn't mean to hurt them. That's fine. Um

4280
08:28:01,060 --> 08:28:03,060
Oh, I'm out of fp. This is awkward

4281
08:28:07,460 --> 08:28:10,500
I can't really tell what damage I'm doing to it to be honest with you

4282
08:28:14,260 --> 08:28:16,900
Staggered impressive we're teaming him

4283
08:28:16,900 --> 08:28:21,620
We are so good bros. I really honestly should probably get closer

4284
08:28:22,820 --> 08:28:25,700
I don't know. One of them is doing some incredible boys damage

4285
08:28:27,860 --> 08:28:30,340
What I don't know why that just happened. I am out of fp again

4286
08:28:34,020 --> 08:28:36,340
I want to assist but I also don't want them to aggro me

4287
08:28:37,300 --> 08:28:43,140
Hey, come over here. I definitely can't reach this far. I don't know why I'm bothering

4288
08:28:44,020 --> 08:28:46,020
Oh

4289
08:28:46,660 --> 08:28:52,420
There we go. Perfect. Thank you. Yeah. Oh knocked his ass

4290
08:28:56,020 --> 08:29:00,820
Oh, he flew away. Nope. Not if I have anything to say about it

4291
08:29:06,740 --> 08:29:12,420
No, no, no, no, no, I'm good. I'm busy this day

4292
08:29:13,220 --> 08:29:17,220
I'm busy. I'm busy. I got places to be

4293
08:29:18,260 --> 08:29:20,260
I'm not a part of this. Dang it

4294
08:29:28,500 --> 08:29:32,260
I was just a bystander. I shouldn't have gotten involved. That's what I get, you know

4295
08:29:32,580 --> 08:29:36,020
That's what I get for trying to insert myself into the drama

4296
08:29:37,620 --> 08:29:39,620
Karma

4297
08:29:39,860 --> 08:29:41,860
Oh

4298
08:29:42,180 --> 08:29:44,180
Where am I?

4299
08:29:46,740 --> 08:29:51,060
Oh, that's right. I heard it from this angle. Uh, what the

4300
08:29:54,180 --> 08:29:56,180
Grab my stuff

4301
08:29:56,740 --> 08:30:04,980
And I'm gonna go back into the castle. I'll come to back to this later. Nice seeing y'all. Really good day. What the heck? Really good time

4302
08:30:10,420 --> 08:30:12,420
Oh

4303
08:30:20,740 --> 08:30:24,180
Is there any way to get up there by the way is just

4304
08:30:25,860 --> 08:30:27,860
Okay, so it seems like you literally oh

4305
08:30:28,740 --> 08:30:31,940
Pardon. Oh, you literally go over here. You just drop down

4306
08:30:35,940 --> 08:30:37,700
Oh

4307
08:30:37,700 --> 08:30:39,700
That's not what I meant to drink. It's fine

4308
08:30:41,140 --> 08:30:43,140
What this cool

4309
08:30:44,340 --> 08:30:46,020
Uh

4310
08:30:46,020 --> 08:30:50,100
This is where they drop the bodies. Oh, this is where they drop the bodies indeed

4311
08:30:51,140 --> 08:30:53,460
Uh, I'm waiting for somebody to jump out of this thing

4312
08:30:54,740 --> 08:30:58,820
What is that? What is that? I don't even know what's next to me. Oh, it's him

4313
08:31:00,900 --> 08:31:04,980
What is that? What is that? I want it. I can kill you like really easy

4314
08:31:08,660 --> 08:31:12,180
Yeah, it's also midnight for me, but I can never sleep

4315
08:31:13,620 --> 08:31:15,620
Status death

4316
08:31:16,500 --> 08:31:18,500
No way. All right, let me

4317
08:31:27,460 --> 08:31:29,460
Go go gadget run away

4318
08:31:31,620 --> 08:31:33,460
Oh

4319
08:31:33,460 --> 08:31:39,700
Please don't hit me with your fire breath or something. All right. Uh, my stuff's right there. That's fine. Where did he come from?

4320
08:31:43,620 --> 08:31:45,620
Oh, there he is

4321
08:31:57,460 --> 08:32:01,140
What is the iris of oculation what

4322
08:32:04,180 --> 08:32:06,180
Oh

4323
08:32:14,420 --> 08:32:18,500
What does that do what does it help me with to quest item

4324
08:32:22,500 --> 08:32:26,100
Have you been looking for that eye and you haven't been able to find it what

4325
08:32:29,060 --> 08:32:31,060
What is this marica's room?

4326
08:32:33,620 --> 08:32:39,220
What's happening? It's too much money. I can't handle that much but not resin

4327
08:32:43,540 --> 08:32:45,860
Oh, man, my favorite kind of resin

4328
08:32:47,300 --> 08:32:49,300
What does that even do?

4329
08:32:49,620 --> 08:32:51,220
Hello

4330
08:32:51,220 --> 08:32:53,220
Something gonna fall and attack me

4331
08:32:55,060 --> 08:32:57,060
Okay, so this is where you could have also landed

4332
08:32:57,700 --> 08:33:04,500
Oh mesmer shoulder ass is interesting. I do I do I am I am a fan of the skeletal militia

4333
08:33:08,260 --> 08:33:10,260
Summer say not

4334
08:33:13,300 --> 08:33:16,340
Naughty naughty. Oh, are you teasing me?

4335
08:33:19,540 --> 08:33:21,540
Hi, I'm back

4336
08:33:22,180 --> 08:33:24,180
I should probably heal

4337
08:33:24,580 --> 08:33:26,580
Any enemies

4338
08:33:27,540 --> 08:33:29,380
No

4339
08:33:29,380 --> 08:33:34,580
No, sorry. I sometimes I like ought to lock on because again, I have terrible eyesight and I feel like I can't see people

4340
08:33:35,700 --> 08:33:37,700
Are the corner

4341
08:33:39,540 --> 08:33:41,300
Where the

Is this this the ramp art? What is that? I was at a boss. Oh wait. No, that's just him

4343
08:33:47,380 --> 08:33:49,220
Okay, this

4344
08:33:49,220 --> 08:33:51,940
Because then I can literally just jump down over here

4345
08:33:52,820 --> 08:33:59,700
Yeah, that's why this is crumbled wall and then uh, he drops the ashes or anything else in there

4346
08:34:00,900 --> 08:34:06,340
But he's not gonna come out until I like go really in there. Um, I don't see anything else of interest

4347
08:34:08,260 --> 08:34:11,860
There's also dudes inside the castle like if I go down this way

4348
08:34:11,860 --> 08:34:13,860
Okay

4349
08:34:20,100 --> 08:34:22,100

No, that's too bad. Oh, that's too bad indeed. Uh, here

Festive grease whoop whoo

4356
08:34:59,860 --> 08:35:01,860
Oh no, who that's supposed to kill

4357
08:35:02,820 --> 08:35:04,820

08:35:12,500 --> 08:35:14,260
Something's gonna jump out

08:35:14,260 --> 08:35:15,940
What do I hear?

4361
08:35:15,940 --> 08:35:17,940
What do I hear? I hear something

4362
08:35:19,620 --> 08:35:23,220
I don't trust it. I don't like what are all these torturey devices

4363
08:35:24,020 --> 08:35:26,020
Hey, this looks like my

4364
08:35:26,100 --> 08:35:30,900
Looks like wonderland. So heck they they still in decor in here. You got like some stretching tables

4365
08:35:32,740 --> 08:35:36,420
Cool axe got like a bear trap for whatever reason. Don't know where I'm supposed to do that

4366
08:35:37,460 --> 08:35:41,460
Check your always check your corners boys. That's what I learned. Always check your corners

4367
08:35:44,100 --> 08:35:47,540
What the heck where is everyone I feel like this should be like 20 dudes over here

4368
08:35:49,620 --> 08:35:51,620
Pickled live up

4369
08:35:51,860 --> 08:35:57,860
Probably good to have again. I barely you know, I'm also not a good elden ring the player because I don't use items a lot

4370
08:35:57,860 --> 08:36:02,340
I also don't like pay attention to like stacking and like

4371
08:36:04,580 --> 08:36:06,580
Like physics stuff or like

4372
08:36:08,900 --> 08:36:10,900
Other effects that like um

4373
08:36:12,340 --> 08:36:17,780
Who's running at me that uh, some things may have wait what why am I here?

4374
08:36:20,420 --> 08:36:22,420
All right, I'm out of here

4375
08:36:24,260 --> 08:36:27,380
Almost everybody doesn't oh, I thought it was like a thing that you're supposed to do

4376
08:36:28,260 --> 08:36:32,020
Like well, obviously you should it's recommended that you do it. What?

4377
08:36:34,020 --> 08:36:37,700
There's a chest. How do I get up there? I need I need uppies

4378
08:36:41,140 --> 08:36:43,140
Oh

4379
08:36:44,100 --> 08:36:46,100
I hear something

4380
08:36:46,580 --> 08:36:48,580
Something right below

4381
08:36:49,380 --> 08:36:53,220
Ain't there what there's something up there

4382
08:36:57,940 --> 08:36:59,940
Okay, there's a chest there

4383
08:37:02,180 --> 08:37:04,180
Why is there nothing attacking me

4384
08:37:05,940 --> 08:37:07,940
Where I'm literally locking on a bunch

4385
08:37:08,420 --> 08:37:12,260
Because I'm ready to be why are you standing on that like a weirdo?

4386
08:37:14,660 --> 08:37:16,660
Come on then

4387
08:37:17,540 --> 08:37:23,060
How did that even hurt me? I I didn't understand this because he was a lot of fp. Um

4388
08:37:23,460 --> 08:37:33,700
Never got I can charge it. Hey stab. Oh, there's another one. Oh, oh, I see I see what's happening here

4389
08:37:34,420 --> 08:37:36,420

08:37:36,420 --> 08:37:38,260

4391
08:37:38,260 --> 08:37:42,900
Getting my guard down indeed. Just like creepily standing there on top of the thing

4392
08:37:44,820 --> 08:37:47,220
Did not expect to get you know

4393
08:37:47,620 --> 08:37:56,740
Five guys burger and fries like that to be honest, you know, it'd be easier if I just went inside

4394
08:37:59,940 --> 08:38:01,940
Clever girl

4395
08:38:03,460 --> 08:38:05,460
It was a decoy

4396
08:38:05,780 --> 08:38:12,340
Can you leave messages in this because I'm surprised nobody like left a message like be careful 50 dudes ahead

4397
08:38:13,060 --> 08:38:15,060
Actually, uh

4398
08:38:15,620 --> 08:38:18,820
I'm trying to think of the fastest way to get there

4399
08:38:20,020 --> 08:38:27,220
I can't pass these dudes. Pardon. No, no, this is not what I'm sparing your lives essentially

4400
08:38:28,100 --> 08:38:29,940
um

4401
08:38:29,940 --> 08:38:31,940

Oh, I'll be right with you. Let me come over here

4407
08:39:04,020 --> 08:39:06,020

Oh, I miss I'm not locking on don't kill me. Don't kill me again, please

08:39:21,220 --> 08:39:23,460
It's on you stab you all right

4410
08:39:24,820 --> 08:39:30,980
I know sometimes like I like picks up my last thing spirit gravestone. I don't know what the hell that be

4411
08:39:31,940 --> 08:39:37,140
Any one of you partners want to come out here and farm me like a man instead of throwing pots at me like a wuss

4412
08:39:44,180 --> 08:39:49,780
And I'm like, can I get you into one go? Yeah, I can oh what's how are you not dead the heck

4413
08:39:50,900 --> 08:39:55,780
I expected I didn't do that. I'm gonna do that, but needless to pretend I did. Um

4414
08:39:56,820 --> 08:39:58,820
expected collat

4415
08:40:00,980 --> 08:40:02,980
Oh

4416
08:40:02,980 --> 08:40:04,740
Watch this be like

4417
08:40:04,740 --> 08:40:06,740
nothing

4418
08:40:06,740 --> 08:40:09,240
What is a sick like what is that?

4419
08:40:10,580 --> 08:40:12,580
What is that?

4420
08:40:13,220 --> 08:40:15,220
All right, whatever. Um

4421
08:40:17,460 --> 08:40:20,820
I'm very good at access you'll soon discover

4422
08:40:21,620 --> 08:40:24,100
So how do I get to that one?

4423
08:40:25,940 --> 08:40:27,940
Do I need to

4424
08:40:31,780 --> 08:40:33,780
How do I get over there

4425
08:40:36,500 --> 08:40:38,500
I did not I don't see

4426
08:40:39,540 --> 08:40:44,980
An entrance to said room. Okay, there's stairs leading up but from where

4427
08:40:54,260 --> 08:40:55,780
All right

4428
08:40:55,860 --> 08:41:02,980
Maybe it's no because that leads upstairs to him. Is there another way over here? Oh, okay. I see no

4429
08:41:03,460 --> 08:41:07,380
I didn't know I could go over this way. There's a lot of freaking cages. Jeez

4430
08:41:08,180 --> 08:41:10,180
Is anybody over this side? No, all right

4431
08:41:10,900 --> 08:41:12,900
Hey, boomie

4432
08:41:14,740 --> 08:41:16,740
Something better in this chest

4433
08:41:19,140 --> 08:41:21,140
Actually, that's very helpful

4434
08:41:25,940 --> 08:41:27,940
I don't really need that

4435
08:41:29,780 --> 08:41:32,740
Take that because there's a lot of fire damage stuff

4436
08:41:36,420 --> 08:41:38,420
All right, you do your wrong area

4437
08:41:40,900 --> 08:41:42,900
All right, let me get out of this

4438
08:41:43,780 --> 08:41:45,780
I just teleport. Okay. Yep

4439
08:41:45,780 --> 08:41:47,780
Be

4440
08:41:49,300 --> 08:41:54,500
Our cages there's so many of you. That's a little cat castle canonically

4441
08:41:55,460 --> 08:42:00,260
Is our country home. Oh, boomie. What are you doing? Are you good, bro?

4442
08:42:03,620 --> 08:42:05,620
Here's your boy

4443
08:42:07,060 --> 08:42:08,980
Here's your boy

4444
08:42:08,980 --> 08:42:13,060
Squish-squish-squish-squish-squish. Oh pata valley pata valley, boomie

4445
08:42:13,780 --> 08:42:16,420
Squish-squish-squish-squish the pouch

4446
08:42:21,780 --> 08:42:23,780
Knot what about knots

4447
08:42:29,860 --> 08:42:31,860
Tying some knots

4448
08:42:38,260 --> 08:42:40,260
I'm actually really tired because it's almost 1 a.m

4449
08:42:41,220 --> 08:42:43,220
So I'm gonna end it here

4450
08:42:46,340 --> 08:42:50,900
Oh my gosh, I'm falling asleep. I'm really almost just like face-planted under my keyword. Um

4451
08:42:52,820 --> 08:42:56,340
Boomie tweaking out. No, he's fine. He's he's even he's tired

4452
08:42:57,860 --> 08:43:04,500
He's been a little skittish anxious boy lately. I think that bag really traumatized him. So I think he's

4453
08:43:05,460 --> 08:43:07,700
He's really anxious free when I'm

4454
08:43:08,580 --> 08:43:13,140
With him. So oh big yawn. Good job, mister

4455
08:43:15,140 --> 08:43:20,100
Well, good night. I'll see you guys tomorrow for the big collab

4456
08:43:20,180 --> 08:43:23,460
I can't wait lots of cool people are gonna be in it

4457
08:43:24,100 --> 08:43:28,180
Uh, feel free to ask a question. That's fine. Um, just so you guys know I'm gonna apologize

4458
08:43:28,260 --> 08:43:34,820
Is it gonna be like there's like 15 of us? So chat interactions probably gonna be low. I'll try my best

4459
08:43:35,620 --> 08:43:40,980
Um to interact with you guys. Normally, I usually will text message you guys in the chat. Um

4460
08:43:41,620 --> 08:43:43,620
Because it's like a pain to like try to mute stuff

4461
08:43:44,180 --> 08:43:46,180
Um, yeah

4462
08:43:48,580 --> 08:43:50,980
Uh, why is it plans?

4463
08:43:56,420 --> 08:43:58,420
What's today

4464
08:44:00,020 --> 08:44:03,300
Wait, no today's thursday. Sorry that's

08:44:05,540 --> 08:44:11,140
That's saturday. I thought today was friday because but then you said blue site and I'm like wait

4466
08:44:11,220 --> 08:44:13,860
I would have been doing streaming at that time

08:44:14,900 --> 08:44:16,900
um, because it's

4468
08:44:16,980 --> 08:44:18,980
That's tomorrow

4469
08:44:19,700 --> 08:44:20,820
Um

4470
08:44:20,820 --> 08:44:24,820
Smasher passes a maybe I have to see if Toma's still up for it

4471
08:44:26,020 --> 08:44:28,580
Because she's been dealing with some stuff

4472
08:44:30,260 --> 08:44:32,260
So we'll see

4473
08:44:32,500 --> 08:44:37,700
Uh, wait, it's friday. Wait, what's today?

4474
08:44:42,020 --> 08:44:47,300

I'm use your time. It's friday. So technically today

4476
08:44:54,260 --> 08:45:00,740
Because it's 1 a.m. Just about almost for me. Why do I feel like this dragon? I'm gonna turn around. It's gonna be like over on my side

4477
08:45:01,300 --> 08:45:03,300
um

4478
08:45:04,500 --> 08:45:07,700
Yeah, I started streaming on thursday and I streamed into friday. Oh

4479
08:45:11,220 --> 08:45:19,060
Umi keeps tapping me like hurry it up. Um, so technically it's today. Um, we'll be the first one

4480
08:45:20,100 --> 08:45:22,100
Uh, it'll be a

4481
08:45:23,620 --> 08:45:25,620
What's i'ma call it?

4482
08:45:26,260 --> 08:45:28,260
Asmr

4483
08:45:32,340 --> 08:45:38,340
Where did I put? Oh, yeah, it's asmr. Um stream and I'm I'm kind of

4484
08:45:39,540 --> 08:45:44,820
Going back and I'm doing the asmr with the maid of asche bevelie

4485
08:45:46,020 --> 08:45:51,380
And um, but like with added twists and stuff. Um

4486
08:45:52,340 --> 08:45:53,540
Um

4487
08:45:53,540 --> 08:45:58,660
Second longest viewer stream. What are you talking about? I streamed for like 11 hours once

4488
08:46:00,580 --> 08:46:03,780
Um, but yeah, so we'll see

4489
08:46:04,500 --> 08:46:07,140
Um, it might be a little bit tame because I'm shy

4490
08:46:07,940 --> 08:46:12,660
Um, but we'll see I expect it to be wild as I say I'm gonna be shy. Um

4491
08:46:14,180 --> 08:46:17,060
But yeah, we'll see we'll see we'll see. Um

4492
08:46:17,700 --> 08:46:19,700
Um

4493
08:46:20,020 --> 08:46:22,820
It'll be nice to not have to worry about stuff

4494
08:46:24,980 --> 08:46:29,700
So I went to 12 hours. Well, yeah, I don't go to 12 hours. I think I almost I almost said 12 hours

4495
08:46:29,780 --> 08:46:36,420
I was like 11 50 because uh youtube stopped like can't the vods get ruined when you go past 12 hours

4496
08:46:36,660 --> 08:46:41,620
Um, they won't I literally can't do it. So you have to like end the stream and start another one if you're doing a 24 hour stream

4497
08:46:42,740 --> 08:46:44,180
um

4498
08:46:44,180 --> 08:46:50,020
But yeah, it'll be cool. And then another week. I want to do another game. I want to play a game. So we'll see

4499
08:46:52,180 --> 08:46:54,660
Is there it over 13? Yeah, she did like 15

4500
08:46:55,140 --> 08:46:58,020
Oh, no, she did 16 hour legal legends stream. I remember

4501
08:46:58,980 --> 08:47:00,980
Little sis dropped me off here. She went right home

4502
08:47:02,340 --> 08:47:06,420
Yeah, she'll just look I don't know if she knows what to drive bro. You might have to walk home

4503
08:47:07,860 --> 08:47:09,860
um

4504
08:47:10,420 --> 08:47:11,620
Yeah

4505
08:47:11,620 --> 08:47:17,860
Yeah, that's like this like Elden ring is my comfort game the way that league is like her comfort game

4506
08:47:18,420 --> 08:47:20,740
And then I'm pretty I don't I don't know if

4507
08:47:21,140 --> 08:47:27,300
Fighting of Isaac is strong. He's comfort game. And I don't know about the other girls. I'll have to ask that'd be a good thing to ask

4508
08:47:28,260 --> 08:47:30,340
um

4509
08:47:30,340 --> 08:47:36,100
Yeah, she's been like really into runescape and it's really fun fun to see her and then you guys helping her and stuff is sweet

4510
08:47:36,580 --> 08:47:39,380
Like the reflings and everybody else and stuff

4511
08:47:42,020 --> 08:47:46,900
Every guy I know she was like geeking out over the lord of the rings. I remember she uh when I called her

4512
08:47:47,540 --> 08:47:48,660
um

4513
08:47:48,660 --> 08:47:54,100
She was telling me about it. She's like I thought I was so polished and then my game froze and I was just like

4514
08:47:57,220 --> 08:47:59,700
Kind of eldering our record wants to hunt her cool

4515
08:48:02,180 --> 08:48:04,180
Oh

4516
08:48:04,980 --> 08:48:06,980
The Elden ring just crashed

4517
08:48:09,220 --> 08:48:14,020
It just shut off for me. Okay, that was weird. I don't know why I did that

4518
08:48:18,100 --> 08:48:22,500
Yeah, the audio just went but for me like the whole thing closed. I'm just gonna exit and save

4519
08:48:28,580 --> 08:48:30,580
No, it's not I want it

4520
08:48:31,460 --> 08:48:35,540
Ah, okay, let me do this my remote doing it by my keyboard

4521
08:48:37,780 --> 08:48:39,780
Madame she be

4522
08:48:44,100 --> 08:48:46,500
She just Elden ring. Yeah. Yeah, we pretty much do

4523
08:48:47,380 --> 08:48:50,180
because I was really talking to her about
