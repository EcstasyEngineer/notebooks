1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,920
I don't know if it's working.

2
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,920
Is it working?

3
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,920
I don't know if it's working.

4
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,920
Hello?

5
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,920
Can you hear me?

6
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,920
Hello?

7
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,920
Oh, it worked.

8
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,920
Hi.

9
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,920
I will be a small shibby.

10
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,920
Small shibby.

11
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,920
Baby Small Shibby today.

12
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,920
Where is going to play some album, right?

13
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,920
I just want to get some stuff in this play.

14
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,920
No pressure.

15
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,920
Just hanging.

16
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,920
Just spending time.

17
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,920
I was just going to play by myself.

18
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,920
But I don't want to.

19
00:01:48,920 --> 00:02:12,920
Hello?

20
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,920
Hey, it's you and it's me.

21
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,920
We're just hanging out as cool as can be.

22
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:23,920
My chair is very squeaky for some reason.

23
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,920
Hello, how goes it?

24
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,920
I just started.

25
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,920
I woke up, fed the babies by myself,

26
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,920
and I don't really have anything to do,

27
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,920
so I want to play some eldering.

28
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:43,920
Before I play Doom later.

29
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,920
Just comfy morning.

30
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,920
Hello, hi everybody.

31
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,920
My chair is extremely squeaky.

32
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,920
I might need to tighten this up.

33
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:58,920
This is just kind of impromptu scuff full stream.

34
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,920
Excuse me.

35
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,920
I'll probably keep the vibe up and stuff though,

36
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,920
so you don't have to worry about that

37
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,920
in terms of like FOMO and all that.

38
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,920
I'll move myself up a little bit.

39
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:22,920
Hello, hello, hi, hi.

40
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,920
Okay.

41
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,920
Arm.

42
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,920
Shippity.

43
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,920
Yeah, we're early.

44
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,920
Yeah, you can chill.

45
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,920
There's no berries in here.

46
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,920
Hi, hello.

47
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,920
Okay, boomie.

48
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,920
Oh, boomie knocked my water bottle off my desk.

49
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,920
I totally forgot about that.

50
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,920
Where did it go?

51
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,920
Oh, here it is.

52
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,920
He like freaked out and accidentally knocked it off

53
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:03,920
and then spazzed all the way over to my closet.

54
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,920
Hi, boomie.

55
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,920
What's up?

56
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,920
I have a pumpkin scone.

57
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,920
I want to take a bite of my pumpkin scone.

58
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,920
I haven't tried it yet.

59
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,920
I got it yesterday.

60
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,920
Arm.

61
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,920
Mmm.

62
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,920
How does it get carrot cake?

63
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,920
Does it give me carrot cake instead?

64
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,920
I don't know.

65
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,920
Either way, nice fall flavors.

66
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:41,920
What are you eating?

67
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,920
When we just tried to eat one of my nail clippings

68
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,920
from yesterday that I missed and I was cleaning.

69
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,920
Why would you want to eat that?

70
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:56,920
I don't understand.

71
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,920
Hello, Riefling.

72
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,920
Hello, Karam.

73
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,920
Hello, Arlitz.

74
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,920
Hello, Bling Heart.

75
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,920
Hello, Snow Berries.

76
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,920
Hello, Snippets.

77
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,920
Hello, Fim Pals.

78
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,920
What?

79
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,920
What's happening?

80
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:21,920
Oh, you told me to make space for you so you can lay down.

81
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,920
Is this what you're asking me to do?

82
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,920
There you go.

83
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:28,920
Here, I pushed some space.

84
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,920
Hey, why don't you lay down over here?

85
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,920
I can't see past your body.

86
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,920
Hey, over here, mister.

87
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,920
Come on.

88
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:45,920
But yeah, I was just watching some, like,

89
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,920
where some scotty fragments were,

90
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,920
so you'll probably hear me turn on my TV

91
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,920
just to look.

92
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:58,920
Oh, good boy, Bling, the spot I cleared through.

93
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,920
And yeah, that's really it.

94
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,920
We're just hanging out.

95
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,920
We're not, it's not really a serious stream.

96
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,920
Not that any of my streams are serious, but, you know,

97
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,920
you know how it feels.

98
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,920
I kind of just feel like hanging out.

99
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,920
BGM's loud?

100
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,920
Okay, thank you for letting me know.

101
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:34,920
I turned it down a bit.

102
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,920
Okay, from what I recall,

103
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,920
I know I was over here and there's, like,

104
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,920
something down here,

105
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:52,920
but I'm going to focus on getting the scotty fragments.

106
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,920
And there's one that I missed.

107
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,920
And like I said, you'll probably, what the heck,

108
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,920
I'm scared of me, you'll probably hear me,

109
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,920
like, turn on my TV and, like, play a YouTube video.

110
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,920
And yes, the person is male

111
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,920
that I'm watching the walkthrough of.

112
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:19,920
So, yeah, I don't really know what to tell you.

113
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,920
Why is it a sad day?

114
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,920
Why is it a sad day?

115
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,920
Dear God, how many layers do you just go?

116
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,920
I'm playing Elden Ring, I'm watching,

117
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,920
she'd be playing Elden Ring, I was watching.

118
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,920
Someone playing Elden Ring?

119
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,920
Mercy, yeah, Mercy's watching you play.

120
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:37,920
Okay, so there, wait, is it over here?

121
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:46,920
Yeah, there was a place that I missed

122
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:57,920
when running around.

123
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:03,920
I might...

124
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:13,920
There's a secret room I totally didn't notice, apparently.

125
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,920
My nose is itchy.

126
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,920
Oh wait, I went the wrong way.

127
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:24,920
Ow.

128
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,920
I can make it there.

129
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:37,920
Let's see if I can even make it there.

130
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,920
I'm pressing Y to climb.

131
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,920
Oh, he just missed me.

132
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:49,920
And then it's up here.

133
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,920
I'm going down here.

134
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:58,920
So, I didn't notice that next to the little scorpion boys,

135
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:04,920
there's a secret room I can't see.

136
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,920
With the...

137
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:13,920
Oh my God, I forgot about this guy being here.

138
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,920
I forgot about that.

139
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:25,920
And then if you keep going, there's a cross of Micola

140
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,920
with the Scottotru fragment.

141
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:33,920
And I didn't know that that was there.

142
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:42,920
Oh, I missed.

143
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,920
So, I only need to grab that.

144
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,920
Your arm is sinstral.

145
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,920
Wow, he's really trying to be like Jesus for real.

146
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,920
But yeah, that was the whole thing I just missed.

147
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,920
And also over here.

148
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,920
I'm sure somebody pointed it out.

149
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,920
I don't know what the drive bouquet is about.

150
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,920
But I might have missed not seeing it

151
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:15,920
if they pointed it out to me in chat.

152
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,920
It looks like there's more, there might be more stuff down there.

153
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,920
But I don't really care about that.

154
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,920
I only came for the Scottotru fragment.

155
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,920
Oh, but they do have me aggroed.

156
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,920
Okay, now I can leave.

157
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,920
I missed that.

158
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,920
And then I already did that one over there.

159
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,920
So, I'm just gonna...

160
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,920
I'm gonna see what the guy says next.

161
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,920
Good morning.

162
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,920
Good morning.

163
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,920
As I die.

164
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,920
Did I get that one?

165
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,920
I don't know if I got that one.

166
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,920
I must have, because I have the grace unlocked.

167
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:10,920
Let me just double check.

168
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,920
Because you can get to...

169
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,920
Why is this so funny?

170
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:21,920
You can get to plus 12 without major bosses.

171
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:27,920
So, I'm just trying to do that, you know?

172
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,920
Yeah, it does connect to the main map.

173
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,920
It's actually layered on top of it.

174
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,920
Yep.

175
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:41,920
What do I have marked on the map in this direction?

176
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,920
Oh, I don't know when I was...

177
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,920
Oh, because I was talking to...

178
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,920
No, I just want to unmark it.

179
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,920
Thank you.

180
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,920
I take this road.

181
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,920
I just want to make sure...

182
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,920
Excuse me.

183
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,920
Good morning.

184
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,920
Good morning.

185
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,920
Hello, hi.

186
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,920
Hello.

187
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,920
Oh, I'm totally missing the bridge I need to go on.

188
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,920
It's also really bright outside and my screen is dark

189
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:23,920
and my window is right behind my screen.

190
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,920
So, I'm just grabbing some fragments

191
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,920
or just hanging out.

192
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,920
I have my higher voice on

193
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:40,920
because I'm just in that sort of cutesy chill head space right now.

194
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,920
What is that? I don't know.

195
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,920
So, apparently there's another one.

196
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,920
I might have already grabbed it.

197
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,920
I'm thinking that I might have grabbed it.

198
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,920
I'm not so sure.

199
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,920
I must have because I've definitely run through here before

200
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,920
so I think I did grab it.

201
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,920
Yeah, I definitely did.

202
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:10,920
Okay, let me sit down.

203
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,920
I still don't have enough.

204
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,920
I thought I had more.

205
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,920
I don't.

206
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,920
So, let's see.

207
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:26,920
What else does this dude say?

208
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:50,920
Whoa, I actually skipped a hug.

209
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,920
Did I get that?

210
00:13:53,920 --> 00:14:09,920
Yes, I definitely did.

211
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,920
Okay, I definitely grabbed the one over here.

212
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:18,920
I'm just kind of going through what this guy is saying.

213
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,920
Just to retrace my steps,

214
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:38,920
make sure that I've covered all the ground.

215
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,920
Okay, I already got one from Folie.

216
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:48,920
Okay, I already got that one.

217
00:14:48,920 --> 00:15:01,920
Yeah, I'll keep talking faster.

218
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:20,920
What?

219
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,920
What the frick?

220
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:29,920
Did I get there already?

221
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,920
Hold on, you're going too fast.

222
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:40,920
I totally missed what you just said.

223
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:46,920
You didn't even say anything.

224
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:56,920
Yes, I did that.

225
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:01,920
Yep.

226
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:16,920
Okay, I did that before.

227
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:26,920
Okay, he said that they're next to this.

228
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:32,920
Yes, that is my TV.

229
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,920
This has really been me watching video guides while playing

230
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,920
because I just don't know shit learning.

231
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:47,920
It's not even like, I did this anyways for like a base game

232
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:53,920
because this is a type of game where I don't feel like...

233
00:16:53,920 --> 00:17:04,920
Oh, hi.

234
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:17,920
Yeah, I'm happy that so many guys are glad to see me this morning.

235
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,920
I like streaming early.

236
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,920
I don't mind it.

237
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,920
I've already gotten all my stuff done, so you might as well.

238
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:29,920
You know me, you know me, you know me, you know me.

239
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,920
Going from the church, yes, I did.

240
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,920
I got that one.

241
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,920
Do you know how far you are?

242
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,920
But there is a big collection of four or five right at an optional boss.

243
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,920
I don't think I've done that.

244
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,920
I think I know which one you're talking about.

245
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,920
I haven't done those yet.

246
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,920
Hello, good morning.

247
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,920
Everybody's so happy to see me so early.

248
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,920
I didn't expect this.

249
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:02,920
Okay, so he said next to this one there's an encampment which is right over here

250
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:07,920
and that there should be one in here.

251
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,920
I think I'm not quite sure.

252
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,920
Am I, did I get it?

253
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,920
Oh, there is one right there.

254
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,920
What the frick?

255
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,920
I thought it, I missed that.

256
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,920
That's like just literally there.

257
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,920
What the hell?

258
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,920
I could have sworn I ran through there, but apparently not.

259
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:29,920
All right, well, let's take, let's pop a squat.

260
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,920
Simply she be caught in peak.

261
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,920
Okay, yes.

262
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:43,920
All right, so now I'm at eight, so that's cool.

263
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:48,920
We're getting on with that.

264
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:53,920
What the fuck?

265
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,920
All right, talk to her.

266
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:02,920
Okay.

267
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,920
Yes.

268
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,920
Yes, I was in there.

269
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:14,920
It sucked.

270
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:25,920
Okay, I got that.

271
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,920
Oh, okay, that's why I get that map fragment.

272
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,920
That makes sense.

273
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:35,920
Wait, did I already get that crease?

274
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,920
Oh yeah.

275
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,920
Oh, I already, what the fuck?

276
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,920
I'm stupid.

277
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:46,920
Fuck, anyways.

278
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:59,920
Why would it do it all the way back there?

279
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:05,920
Did I grab that one?

280
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,920
Is that one all the way up here?

281
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,920
Is that what he's talking about?

282
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,920
I need to look at the map again.

283
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:18,920
Yep, just click and scatter tree fragments.

284
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,920
Surprise, surprise, it's me.

285
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:25,920
Just a really boring farming stream, but if some of you guys like to watch me just talk

286
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,920
and I know sometimes, I know me personally.

287
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,920
I like to have somebody in the background while I'm doing stuff.

288
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,920
So hi, it's me.

289
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,920
I'm in the background and you're doing stuff and you're being productive, right?

290
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,920
It's called shibbity fragments.

291
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:43,920
It's funny, I was watching someone and they're like the skadoosh fragments, the shibbity toilet,

292
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,920
the shibbity toilet fragments.

293
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:48,920
They were just calling the scatter tree fragments something different each time,

294
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:54,920
but with like incomplete seriousness and I was just dying and I couldn't focus on the video.

295
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:59,920
Okay, so that's...

296
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:05,920
Okay, so it is up there, so let's do it.

297
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,920
Do I have anything marked on my map?

298
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:12,920
I'll find out in a second.

299
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,920
I do, it's the one.

300
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:24,920
Where's the one pointing at?

301
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:30,920
I hate when I mark something on my map and I can't find it again.

302
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,920
Oh, I'm not facing the right direction, that's why.

303
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,920
Oh, I already marked, I'm stupid.

304
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,920
Alright, let's go.

305
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,920
Yeah, you can like, don't worry, I'm just hanging out.

306
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:45,920
I'm just chilling.

307
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:49,920
I'm just hanging out.

308
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,920
Yeah, I'm here, you're gonna be productive.

309
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,920
You are having a productive morning.

310
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:58,920
If you're playing Elden Ring, like me, you're productive.

311
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:02,920
If you gotta get chores done, do it productively.

312
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:06,920
We're gonna avoid this fire golem, motherfucker, that's all I'm gonna say.

313
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,920
That's all I'm gonna say.

314
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,920
Did I grab this one? I don't know.

315
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,920
I'm not quite sure.

316
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,920
Okay, so we said, oh, okay.

317
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,920
I didn't even grab that one.

318
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,920
Ah!

319
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,920
Bye.

320
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,920
Bye, I'm teleporting.

321
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:28,920
She didn't wanna work today.

322
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,920
No, but you have to, you gotta work today.

323
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:37,920
I know it's hard, I know it's hard to get up and it's just like, it's kind of mentally exhausting

324
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:42,920
and you don't wanna deal with people, but you got this.

325
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,920
You gotta do it, you gotta get that bag, sis.

326
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:51,920
You gotta get out of that car, lonely, glizzy, and you gotta go do work.

327
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,920
And then you'll be able to come home and relax.

328
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,920
It's all about what you make of it, you know?

329
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,920
You just gotta have a good day.

330
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,920
You just gotta make sure you have a good day.

331
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,920
You gotta have that mindset.

332
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,920
You gotta have that grind set, you know?

333
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,920
She beats against mental?

334
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,920
Yeah, 100%.

335
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,920
You know, you just got out of work?

336
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,920
Oh my.

337
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,920
European, European alert.

338
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,920
Euro alert.

339
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,920
Okay.

340
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,920
Oh, Boomi's so cute next to me.

341
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,920
He just wants to hang out.

342
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,920
Hi.

343
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,920
Why do you curl your toes when you're sleeping?

344
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,920
You're the only kind of man that does that.

345
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,920
See, like curls his back toes.

346
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,920
Give me them.

347
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,920
Give me them beans.

348
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,920
Ewww.

349
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,920
Alright, what's the next one, boy?

350
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,920
Yep, I just got that one.

351
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,920
Facts, bro.

352
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,920
Oh my God, Jesus Christ.

353
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,920
There's so many people in the camp.

354
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,920
Did I?

355
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,920
I don't think I went to the church at a crusade.

356
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,920
I don't think I did.

357
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,920
Oh, no, I did.

358
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,920
I did.

359
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,920
Where?

360
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:32,920
Oh, yeah, because then I fought.

361
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,920
Oh, no, I didn't fight him.

362
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,920
People were like, why where was he?

363
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,920
Wait.

364
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,920
I didn't mean to press that.

365
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:50,920
I pressed my controller instead of my remote.

366
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,920
What are you doing?

367
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,920
Uh, my remote.

368
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,920
What are you doing, boomi?

369
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,920
What are you doing, bro?

370
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,920
Hello, hi.

371
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,920
I found out from Helldivers too that Europeans

372
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,920
have three months mandatory vacations

373
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,920
because B Team of Devs made a bunch of crap updates

374
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,920
and the ones coming back from vacation are pointing out fires.

375
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,920
Really, interesting.

376
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,920
I didn't know that.

377
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,920
I did not know that.

378
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,920
There's something else in this church that I think I missed.

379
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,920
I don't think it's a scat-o-tea fragment.

380
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,920
I think it's something else.

381
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,920
I don't know why it's showing my runes.

382
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,920
I don't know where I died.

383
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,920
Because to be honest with you,

384
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,920
normally when I first played Elden Ring,

385
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,920
my first playthrough, I really sat through the game

386
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,920
and went and discovered everything,

387
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,920
but that takes hours.

388
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,920
And this time, I'm kind of like,

389
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,920
I want to defeat bosses so I can get some good weapons

390
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:56,920
because Rolana's swords are pretty nice.

391
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,920
Although I do have...

392
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,920
Oh, hi.

393
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,920
I do have...

394
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,920
Oh my God, please jump over the wall.

395
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:10,920
I do have the backhand swords,

396
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:14,920
but the blue skadoo fragments...

397
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:19,920
The blue skadoo we can, too, fragments are...

398
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:24,920
It's literally leveling, essentially.

399
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,920
I also have a lot of sombers that I could use

400
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,920
to level up weapons.

401
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,920
So did I miss something over here?

402
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,920
Oh, it was a rune arc.

403
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,920
Okay, that's still pretty good.

404
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,920
I'll just hang out here for a second.

405
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,920
Will Vila ever play Helldivers together?

406
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,920
It would probably just be us screaming.

407
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,920
What is that?

408
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,920
Oh, it's the chat.

409
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,920
The chat is just freaking out.

410
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,920
Don't worry about it.

411
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,920
Ah, red tracks!

412
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,920
It lost track of the...

413
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,920
It lost connection to you guys.

414
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:13,920
Here, I'll put you guys right there.

415
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,920
No, it wasn't something dangerous.

416
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,920
It's like the...

417
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:35,920
So I use this extension thing as a website.

418
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,920
It's giving me to...

419
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,920
I almost threw up in my mouth.

420
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:47,920
To connect to YouTube chat, so...

421
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,920
Sorry.

422
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,920
Because the double up, the liquidity double up.

423
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,920
All right, my hand is itchy.

424
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,920
What next?

425
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:19,920
Okay, I already did that before on accident.

426
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,920
You didn't say what the grace was, though, bro.

427
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,920
You didn't say what the grace was.

428
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,920
Okay, now I can see the said grace.

429
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,920
You're talking...

430
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,920
You didn't actually show the grace.

431
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,920
It's...

432
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,920
There's one over here.

433
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,920
There's one over here.

434
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,920
Oh, I thought I did open this area up.

435
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,920
Did I climb up here and just didn't go over to this edge?

436
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,920
I must have.

437
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,920
I think I'll go here.

438
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,920
And then here.

439
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,920
And then we'll do that.

440
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,920
Bunspeak is my higher voice.

441
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:08,920
And so when people are just getting on my heads up...

442
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:12,920
If they're like, why is she talking so cutesy?

443
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,920
Yeah.

444
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,920
Because I feel like...

445
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:22,920
Oh, la-la-la-la-la-la-la.

446
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,920
What was that?

447
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,920
One material...

448
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,920
Oh, it's a dog.

449
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,920
Never mind.

450
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,920
I can't see the light.

451
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,920
Hi, sheepies.

452
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,920
Is it...

453
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,920
Oh, this is where I fought the dragon?

454
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,920
Well, I didn't fight him.

455
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,920
He's just fighting other dudes.

456
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:54,920
Okay, so I literally just didn't go to this edge part.

457
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,920
Hello?

458
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,920
Oh, I need to break the rocks.

459
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,920
It's over here, because that's why I'm...

460
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,920
I thought I already did this.

461
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,920
Yes.

462
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,920
I am aware.

463
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,920
Thank you for letting me know.

464
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,920
Yippee!

465
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,920
Yeah.

466
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,920
Alright, cool beans.

467
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,920
New area, bros!

468
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,920
Um...

469
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,920
Oop.

470
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,920
Oh, fuck it.

471
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,920
Pulled me out of the thing,

472
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,920
because of the stupid thing.

473
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,920
Oh, fuck it.

474
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,920
Pulled me out of the thing,

475
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,920
because of the stupid bird.

476
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,920
Stop!

477
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,920
I can't see you.

478
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,920
Ow.

479
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,920
Get down with your bats.

480
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,920
Ow, there's two of you?

481
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,920
I thought you were a statue.

482
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,920
I can't.

483
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,920
Ow.

484
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:04,920
You're doing too much damage for no reason.

485
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,920
Okay!

486
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,920
Pick up.

487
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,920
Thanks for the spinning stone.

488
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,920
What stinky monkey...

489
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,920
Goal!

490
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,920
What are you talking about?

491
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,920
I'm just...

492
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,920
I'm not gonna listen to you anymore.

493
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,920
So then...

494
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,920
over here...

495
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,920
there should be a thingy, my barber.

496
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,920
I know.

497
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,920
Never assume,

498
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,920
because it makes an ass out of you and me.

499
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,920
That's what I say.

500
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,920
There it is!

501
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,920
No.

502
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,920
Pull me his eyes.

503
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,920
He's sleeping with his eyes open,

504
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,920
as cats sometimes do,

505
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,920
because of their secondary eyelids.

506
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,920
Or their third eyelids, rather.

507
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,920
And he's just...

508
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,920
Oh.

509
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,920
There's stupid fucking birds following me still.

510
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,920
And then his mouth is open,

511
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,920
so he looks possessed.

512
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,920
Why do you look possessed?

513
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,920
So, like, we play as a monkey

514
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,920
and hear people talk about the...

515
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,920
Oh!

516
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,920
You mean...

517
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,920
Why don't you just say Black Myth Wukong?

518
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,920
You fucking dork.

519
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,920
Well, that doesn't really lead to anywhere.

520
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,920
Well, it does.

521
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,920
I just can't get there yet.

522
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,920
Let's get some...

523
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,920
Empyrean Blood Virgium.

524
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,920
It's Papa Squat.

525
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,920
How am I doing?

526
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,920
I'm doing good.

527
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:46,920
Now, I'm a Skadu Tree Blessing 9.

528
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,920
Pretty nice.

529
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,920
Pretty good.

530
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,920
Look how...

531
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,920
Can I change my armor?

532
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,920
I swear I have better armor.

533
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,920
I have a Black Knight Helm,

534
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,920
but it makes me heavy.

535
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,920
Guilty hood.

536
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,920
I don't have a lot of stuff

537
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,920
because, again, I was a speedrunning shit.

538
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,920
I could have sworn I had...

539
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,920
When did I get the deathbed dress?

540
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,920
I could have sworn I had...

541
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,920
All their stuff.

542
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,920
There's a set of armor I thought I grabbed,

543
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,920
but I feel like I just see people play

544
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,920
and then I think I did it myself in my own game.

545
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,920
It's just not the case.

546
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,920
You know?

547
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,920
Found Black Knight Gear.

548
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,920
Yeah, like I've heard that, too.

549
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,920
Yeah, we're just comfy farming.

550
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,920
I need a sit.

551
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,920
Let's check on my Tamagotchi.

552
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,920
Drop something.

553
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,920
I don't know what it was.

554
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,920
Oh, my God.

555
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,920
Tamagotchi's sick.

556
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,920
Sick of my shit.

557
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,920
Right, Boomi?

558
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,920
Right here, show.

559
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,920
Take a bath.

560
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,920
Take a bath.

561
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:33,920
Okay, let me have a bite of my pumpkin scone.

562
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,920
Although it tastes like carrot cake, so...

563
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,920
I think they lied to me.

564
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,920
Oh, you put this on New Game Plus?

565
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,920
Yeah, it's not gonna...

566
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:53,920
I made a whole new save for that.

567
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,920
It's really good.

568
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,920
No, it's still alive, surprisingly.

569
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,920
Yeah, I played this before,

570
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,920
but I played it on my PlayStation,

571
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,920
not on my computer.

572
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,920
Okay.

573
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,920
Okay.

574
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,920
Ow.

575
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,920
Yeah, I don't have any new Game Files.

576
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,920
Hello.

577
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,920
Mm-hmm, m-hmm.

578
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,920
Okay.

579
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:59,840
I was gonna read Icy after streaming for a bit and I realized it's the members and I

580
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:07,040
was like oh I guess I'll just have to play longer then.

581
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,040
I'm gonna have FromSoft Enjoyer.

582
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,800
I've only ever played Elden Ring and I played like five seconds of Sekiro

583
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,840
so I can't really claim that. I'm a souls-like enjoyer.

584
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,840
You're watching The Room Today? I thought you were...

585
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,760
I thought it was an ASMR.

586
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,360
They look at the wrong day.

587
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:45,200
That was yesterday? Oh I must have been looking at the wrong day then.

588
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:54,720
Silly, silly me. How was that? How was the ASMR?

589
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,680
I need to learn from Icy's ASMR ways.

590
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:08,400
Okay, what did he say? Where did I? No, I didn't do the next one.

591
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:17,680
Sekiro is your least favorite song from software game and then I beat it. It's my favorite. Nice.

592
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:29,920
I did it.

593
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:50,160
How the fuck am I supposed to get to the Serlian coast?

594
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:08,720
All right boys, looks like we're going on a trip.

595
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,320
Looks like we're going on a trip in my favorite rocket ship.

596
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,920
How the fuck... Wait, how do I get down there? He just explained it.

597
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:33,040
He said go down here and then go here.

598
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:47,600
What the... What the fuck are you talking about bro?

599
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,800
Why are you going in? Why are you in your feelings in my chat right now dude?

600
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,160
Like you're welcome to hang out but what are you on?

601
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,840
What the fuck? Yeah, there's a few ways. I'm looking at one way.

602
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:19,040
We're talking about Elden Ring. Good vibes only bro. Good vibes only.

603
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,200
I don't have the maps for this.

604
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:44,000
Lily was the energy though. I was a little confused there.

605
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:50,560
This is not emo boy hours. This is cute girl playing Elden Ring hours. We have emo boy hours

606
00:39:50,560 --> 00:40:00,000
when Shibani is here. Ever since Melina, don't me, it's never... See if you do it like that then

607
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,840
that's fine. If you frame your trauma in Elden Ring then I will allow it.

608
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:14,240
If you frame all of the trauma dumping in Elden Ring, if you make it Elden Ring relevant,

609
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,080
I will allow it. I will allow it.

610
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,640
Stop laughing.

611
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,080
I'm dying.

612
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,960
Hey, I'm just gonna go this way.

613
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:50,800
Yeah, you can trauma dump your hatred for bail.

614
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,680
The dragon.

615
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,760
The laughter must continue for stream entry.

616
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,880
Hi Shibi, how's it going? Professor Chico is here. Great to see you again.

617
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,960
Hola, Professor Chico.

618
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,080
To Keres? I'm kidding.

619
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:16,240
I'm made in this. That's my trauma. It's okay bro. Do you guys want like dating advice?

620
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:26,080
But like framed, but framed as an Elden Ring? Am I gonna die? It's fine.

621
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,880
How the fuck?

622
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:43,360
Yeah, all right. So what type of gal are you talking to? What's her speed?

623
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:49,360
Like is she like kind of like a Malania type? Is she a Malina type? Is she a Rinalda type?

624
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:54,720
Is she a Rallana type? Is she, you know, like what type of gal is she, you know? What is this?

625
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:01,760
Shadow Ramoon. You're married? Congratulations. I'm so happy for you.

626
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:07,600
So it's a, it's a right card and what's her face type? I understand. Ronnie type.

627
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:14,000
I don't know. I've been listening to a lot of lore about Ronnie and I'm low key not liking her right

628
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:22,080
now. Like she's like, she's cool. Best character design IMO. Just saying. Is there a Grace down

629
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:33,040
here? Because I will kill myself in Elden Ring. And like everything she did to God one was kind

630
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:37,280
of fucked. Like why did she pick him? Like he was like actually the most like chill dude. I felt kind

631
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:48,000
of bad. She's a scrawny type. I don't know which person scrawny would be. Where am I? Oh it worked.

632
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,120
Nice. Nice. The fact there isn't a Grace at the bottom actually pisses me off though.

633
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:59,440
Fuck you little dudes. More of a Gwinnivere understood.

634
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:08,800
Can I please get a Grace? Can I please? I just want a Grace. Please. Can I have a Grace?

635
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:14,160
Can I please have a Grace? Please.

636
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:21,440
I don't know where I'm going. I kind of like, I'm aggroed by someone. Okay. I'm going the wrong way.

637
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:26,400
That's where I'm going. You lost the game. Who are, are you elderly?

638
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:34,640
God one was like my wife stole your dad. No not like God one the golden. You're thinking about somebody

639
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:45,520
else. Was God one dating his mom? I don't know.

640
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:54,320
Astroscience but elderly? No yeah I do need to go further down. I went the wrong way.

641
00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:00,640
Cause what did he do? I actually went too fucking far I think.

642
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,120
Yeah yeah yeah.

643
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:18,160
I'm fucking stupid I went too far. Anyway so let's turn the fuck around buddy.

644
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:28,160
Yeah.

645
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:39,360
You'll date someone's mom? I, okay. God if I recall was married to Mary. What? No you,

646
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:46,560
you're thinking of God, like God free brother. You're thinking of God free brother. You're

647
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:51,280
getting your Gs mixed up thanks to fucking George R R Martin being a fucking weirdo.

648
00:44:51,520 --> 00:45:00,000
Here we are. I can't see shit. Torrent help.

649
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:12,800
Wow what I've always wanted. A deep purple lily. It was God one, what?

650
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:20,480
What are you, I'm thinking of God when the golden. Am I, am I naming people wrong?

651
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:25,840
All right. Is someone telling me that God win?

652
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:35,440
Yeah there's God, God free is married, was married to America. God win was the son.

653
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:42,240
Then there's Godric and God of free. God of fry. I fucking hate George R R Martin for this.

654
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,840
Yes thank you. I know Gilbert Godfrey.

655
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,440
Well because it's George R R Martin's because you got G names, you got R names,

656
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,720
then you got M names. Just how it is.

657
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:10,320
Free my boy Godofroy. Godofroy. I can't even never pronounce his name.

658
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:19,760
I didn't play the game. Fuck you I'm getting one guide by my own, by my own harlots.

659
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:27,040
How dare. All right we're in this fucking cave. We're doing fucking cave shit. We're having a great time.

660
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,600
Something gonna attack me.

661
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:40,080
The fact that nothing is falling from the ceiling and assaulting me right now is

662
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:49,520
extremely weird. Oh nice. I'll have to do a revered spirit ash thank you. Oh finally.

663
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:59,200
Thank you. Thank you so much. You're a dude. You are. I thought you guys were all women.

664
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,760
A disney soul but souls born that means fucking sick.

665
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:14,560
Godfrey, Godwin, Godric, Godofrey, Gideon, Melina, Melinia, Melissa, and Ronnie,

666
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:21,200
Rinala, Rallana. I see all the main characters just like five times fast.

667
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,440
Lies of Dorothy. There's lies of pee. Lies of Dorothy.

668
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:36,880
What? Wait brother you're onto something. Imagine an Oz, a wizard of Oz, souls like.

669
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:42,640
I wouldn't be mad at all. I actually wouldn't mind that.

670
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:52,880
The lies of pee sequel is going to be Oz. Is that legit? Is that legit? They're making one?

671
00:47:53,040 --> 00:48:02,400
Bro, I'm so happy right now. I love lies of pee. Oh my gosh.

672
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:14,880
Holy crap. I don't really care about Sonic. You can shoot me in the fucking head. I don't care.

673
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:20,080
I've never really been into Sonic. I played Sonic. I played a lot of Sonic when I was a kid

674
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:24,880
but I wasn't. I didn't have the autism for Sonic like everybody else does. Hi.

675
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:34,960
Bye bye. What? What? Don't look at me like that.

676
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:40,880
Everybody thinks like I want to fuck Sonic the headshot or the hedgehog.

677
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:47,920
Kingdom Hearts is pretty great. Kingdom Hearts but add Sonic.

678
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:53,280
I know, I know Amy would be really pissed off to hear me say the things I'm saying right now

679
00:48:53,280 --> 00:49:01,600
because she's in love with Shadow. Oh no, no. I definitely was, I definitely like Rouge the bat.

680
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:05,680
Like I remember making my little chow garden and raising some chows.

681
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:10,400
Is it cows? Chows? Chails? I don't know.

682
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:21,520
Listen, my Tism was a wolf quest and wolf role playing. Okay, I don't know what to tell you.

683
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:27,680
I was not a furry but I played as a wolf online. It was mostly just writing and world building.

684
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:36,640
And all levels except physical, I am a wolf. Wait, how? Okay, what does he say?

685
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:45,760
Yeah. Oh, fuck, okay. Well, follow the water all the way southeast.

686
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:51,520
Is there a map nearby that I can... Jesus, fuck.

687
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:57,920
All the way... Oh, I can't see anything so it's probably gonna go all the way down there.

688
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:04,560
Oh my god, the map's all the way over there. Are you trying to kill me?

689
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:10,160
All the way southeast. Is that southwest? Southeast.

690
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:16,880
Why is the water golden? Who is pissing?

691
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:24,080
Oh, you want me to platform? Oh god, I can't do this. Ooh, what's that?

692
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,120
Torrent. Torrent! Torrent!

693
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:41,520
Torrent. I'm killing myself. Torrent. Torrent, please. Torrent. Torrent, I'm stuck. I'm literally fucking stuck.

694
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,880
I

695
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,960
Anger

696
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:04,560
I like this. I just sometimes I just hate platforming with torrent. I don't care about the runes to be honest with you. I really don't.

697
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,040
Um

698
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:17,120
Let's try this again. Torrent behave. What the?

699
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:32,480
I don't know what just happened there. I

700
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:41,120
I'm so confused. I don't know why

701
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:50,640
He literally does something. I don't know if I bumped my stick and it just Emily fucking just went to the side. I

702
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:53,840
What's that?

703
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,800
Can I have it?

704
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,240
Can I have it? It's a do-gem. Cool.

705
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,800
Do-gem

706
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,040
Mama like that. Oh my god. Torrent, please. Torrent, please.

707
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:23,120
It's like he's so hard to control platforming for me. I'm terrible at platforming in general. Um

708
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:30,080
So, yeah, you know how hard it was for me to go through blight town in lies of pee

709
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,480
I was literally just falling off every five seconds

710
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,200
Like lies of pee had so much platforming because you don't have a mount

711
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:43,920
And it's a lot more linear it's not open world

712
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:52,880
No, no, don't get it. Don't get me wrong. Sorry. I'm eating my skull

713
00:52:54,080 --> 00:53:03,680
Torrent doesn't suck is the platforming with torrent sucks. I love torrent. I just can't platform on a horse

714
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,320
Unless it's Skyrim

715
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,040
Hello

716
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Hmm

717
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:44,000
Yeah, because they kind of make torrent a little bit

718
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:50,880
Realistic in terms of if he turns he's obviously going to step a little bit forward

719
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,600
Like you're not going to just like do like a

720
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,640
You're not just going to like clip to the left or the right or something

721
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:06,160
Oh my god, let's just walk and do one jump. How about that?

722
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,480
I'm jump. I'm double jumping when I don't need to

723
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,880
Except for that time

724
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:20,880
See like look how he turns and it's very interesting. Um, where am I going?

725
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:27,120
He said keep following the water. Do I go down?

726
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:38,080
No, I think that leads into nothing

727
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,040
Oh my god

728
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,440
Uh, let's not do that

729
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:53,600
Can you just like all be statues, please I don't feel like dealing with you

730
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,400
Ow

731
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:10,960
Oh my god. Oh my why am I locked in a animation and then stones? I don't

732
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:20,320
All right, the moment I get on that spot, I'm going to get off torrent because I can't deal

733
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:30,480
And then if I need a platform again, I will summon him, you know, you know

734
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:32,640
Oh

735
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:44,960
Potentate what a word potentate

736
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:53,200
I I jumped okay. Thank you. That was weird. Oh, you know what let's just

737
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:58,800
You're absolutely fucking useless right now torrent. I can't see

738
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:04,800
I'm being chased by bug men. I wish I could double jump

739
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:19,360
Stop thank you. I still killed them in three hits. So that's like I need a better weapon, you know

740
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,960
What okay, well

741
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,520
I'm just stupid

742
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:38,480
All right, I'm making my way downtown walking fast birds attack and I'm homebound

743
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:42,080
Meow meow meow meow meow meow meow. Ow. I should have rolled

744
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,360
It's the same thing gonna happen again. Am I just gonna

745
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:50,640
They're like the uh, the fucking hawks from storm built. What do you do?

746
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:53,680
Like I don't recall you having this move set brother

747
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,040
Are they just built different over here?

748
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:02,000
I don't I don't know like how are you still alive?

749
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:06,720
Oh my god, just fucking die already. Jesus christ

750
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:09,360
Are any of you alive?

751
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:12,400
I can't tell because it's dark. Let me let me turn on the light here

752
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:18,720
What is this this is not gonna be worth it. Okay, it's actually fine. Um

753
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,720

754
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,960
Excuse me

My designer everyone he's like a weird creepy uncle

758
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:42,880

Are you sitting? No, I'm not do I need to because I'm not spending okay. I do maybe

760
00:57:49,760 --> 00:58:02,320
What is happening why is there something on fire in the distance? I don't even

761
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:07,360
It's fine. I'm just gonna halt my little self down. I need an armor set

762
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:09,360
I need to see if there's any good armor sets

763
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:14,320
I swear there's one you pick up. It's it's it's I'm too far away from it now, but it's fine

764
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,640
Oh

765
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:30,080
Papa squat. Hey, let's talk to this dude

766
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,880
Hello

767
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:51,520
I was once told a coffin could convey its passenger upon a gentle cruise to the velvet garden of deepest pep

768
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:57,920
Oh to slumber in such a paradise

769
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:09,120
Sick brother, uh anyways, Emma did I go the wrong way? Is this leading me to st. Trina?

770
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,440
What's that deer doing

771
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:19,840
I don't know where any of this stuff is. I don't I'm getting ahead of myself. I I don't think st. Trina is over here

772
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:21,840
I don't know why I'm thinking that

773
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:28,560
It is

774
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:34,960
The gale the gale the jail night armor is nicer to beat the guy for you. I don't feel like beating dudes when I'm fucking weak as hell

775
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:41,200
Yeah, yeah, we're not using torrent. I'm just gonna fall and die off something and I'd rather fall and die my own two feet and my own terms

776
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:51,760
Actually torrent I might need you now

777
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:56,720
I could have gone down that way. I went down the the harder way

778
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:59,280
Death no

779
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:02,480
Why are my on fire? Oh, it's just me kicking up the road

780
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,480
As I run, uh, cool

781
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,480
Anyways

782
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:11,200
So I started blasting

783
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:15,600
I swear I saw why are you all?

784
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,680
I

785
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:22,400
That was I losing it. I swear. I saw our side of grace

786
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,880
I

787
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:29,840

Don't think okay, maybe I'm just a Lulu. I'm just a Lulu

792
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:04,080
I'm delirious out of my mind. I remember watching that one. I was like good. That's funny

793
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:08,000
Oh, there's so many fucking golems. You're so huge

794
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,880
Why are you so big?

795
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:13,600
Sorry, I have to avoid the golem

796
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,920

All right, don't you fucking die don't have any roll berries

1046
01:28:21,300 --> 01:28:25,060
It's going to the beach beach ninky minjaj

1047
01:28:26,820 --> 01:28:32,260
Huh is that a ship or those ruins it looks like a part of a ship, but I think it's just ruins

1048
01:28:33,780 --> 01:28:36,280
And that's our boss that's a boss

1049
01:28:38,900 --> 01:28:40,900
Oh

01:28:40,900 --> 01:28:42,900
Or do I kill him

1051
01:28:47,620 --> 01:28:52,740
They're coffins. Oh shit coffins for the demigods he has the sword

1052
01:28:55,540 --> 01:28:57,540
Kill him all right

1053
01:29:02,980 --> 01:29:04,980
I missed

1054
01:29:09,700 --> 01:29:11,700
Oh

1055
01:29:14,260 --> 01:29:19,460
How do you all have red eyes like you're dragon I'm not lost on to you

1056
01:29:23,780 --> 01:29:26,420
I took the turn off auto lock and it kept fucking me up

1057
01:29:29,700 --> 01:29:36,340
Oh, I have to kill a demi something or other or is that a troll? What are you? Um

1058
01:29:38,740 --> 01:29:40,740
I

1059
01:29:48,100 --> 01:29:50,100
Come over here

1060
01:29:50,180 --> 01:29:52,580
I need to do some crowd control before I uh

1061
01:29:53,780 --> 01:29:57,380
The fact that they haven't aggroed me yet is very impressive. Oh now they have

1062
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:00,500
That's fine

1063
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:02,500
I'm out of juice

1064
01:30:04,980 --> 01:30:06,980
You have a weird looking face brother

1065
01:30:08,740 --> 01:30:10,740
I

1066
01:30:13,380 --> 01:30:18,740
Why are you so weak to magic but you're sorcerer I'm quite confused by this

1067
01:30:27,780 --> 01:30:33,780
Now hate bloodstones let me back up. Oh, there's so many of you

1068
01:30:39,140 --> 01:30:41,140
Oh

1069
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:50,900
God there's so many little fucking trolls guys have a beach day or something like

1070
01:30:55,140 --> 01:30:57,540
I kind of wish they were faster than her

1071
01:31:01,300 --> 01:31:04,980
Or at least she was faster than them because they all run at the fucking same speed

1072
01:31:08,740 --> 01:31:10,740
I

1073
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:16,500
Am out of stuff

1074
01:31:18,340 --> 01:31:21,780
Oh, you killed your own guy. Thank you for that. I appreciate that a lot actually

1075
01:31:23,940 --> 01:31:26,900
I don't quite understand that spell. I thought I turned out a locking off

1076
01:31:30,580 --> 01:31:32,580
Okay

1077
01:31:33,380 --> 01:31:35,380
Oh

1078
01:31:42,740 --> 01:31:49,140
Starline sword do they all die? Oh, they did uh

1079
01:31:54,820 --> 01:31:56,820
Interesting

1080
01:31:58,020 --> 01:32:00,020
Cool katana time

1081
01:32:00,420 --> 01:32:02,420
I can't even hold. Oh, I can't use it

1082
01:32:10,020 --> 01:32:12,020
Let's go level it up, baby

1083
01:32:13,940 --> 01:32:15,940
Oh, I didn't mean to do that

1084
01:32:16,260 --> 01:32:18,260
I

1085
01:32:27,780 --> 01:32:32,740
I'm Virgil who's Virgil what the hell

1086
01:32:35,940 --> 01:32:37,940
Why is it look so small

1087
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:43,060
I feel like I feel like the other katana was longer. Um hot. No wrong place

1088
01:32:44,020 --> 01:32:46,020
Hello

1089
01:32:47,620 --> 01:32:49,620
Going the wrong way

1090
01:32:53,060 --> 01:32:58,180
Hey, I know I haven't been here in a bit

1091
01:33:00,660 --> 01:33:05,140
Oh, don't let me cry. Oh, okay. Yeah, you're right. I didn't I totally fucking missed that

1092
01:33:05,380 --> 01:33:07,380

1093
01:33:10,660 --> 01:33:18,100
I am the storm that is approach. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Sorry. I told I went over my head. Why I'm you trained here

1094
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:25,460
Oh, okay, you're a prisoner

1095
01:33:26,020 --> 01:33:30,340
Well, no grudging my being a pretty sign despite my different sides it helps me

1096
01:33:33,540 --> 01:33:35,540
Anyways

1097
01:33:48,260 --> 01:33:50,740
Why is somber 8 so hard to find

1098
01:33:56,260 --> 01:33:58,260
Oh

1099
01:33:58,980 --> 01:34:00,980
Yeah, lunch hour

1100
01:34:00,980 --> 01:34:05,940
What time is it? It's over 37. What can I have for lunch? That's a great question

1101
01:34:10,820 --> 01:34:12,820
I had my scone

1102
01:34:14,020 --> 01:34:18,500
Yesterday I had some rice and salmon. I could make rice and salmon again

1103
01:34:19,060 --> 01:34:21,060
I

1104
01:34:25,460 --> 01:34:33,220
Can buy I don't have the ball bearings for that. I know exactly what I had didn't never went to that cave. Um

1105
01:34:33,220 --> 01:34:35,220
Oh

1106
01:34:45,700 --> 01:34:49,380
Because it's with the crystal ladies, right the two it's a it's a dual thing

1107
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:55,140
Are you saying there's no somber 8 and

1108
01:34:57,140 --> 01:34:59,140
What do you call it lands

1109
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:02,900
In shadow lands

1110
01:35:03,380 --> 01:35:06,500
And escape the shadow land borderlands

1111
01:35:12,340 --> 01:35:17,540
Pizza maybe you get a new armor set bro, what the fuck am I wearing?

1112
01:35:22,420 --> 01:35:24,420
Um

1113
01:35:26,820 --> 01:35:28,820
Because I could

1114
01:35:29,780 --> 01:35:34,020
Go to the fucking oh my god, why I got is like a random barrel

1115
01:35:36,020 --> 01:35:38,020
And then like a random dude

1116
01:35:39,540 --> 01:35:42,820
It's it I bet there's some lower significance here

1117
01:35:44,660 --> 01:35:46,660
Of a little guy

1118
01:35:47,540 --> 01:35:49,780
In his front and is the child

1119
01:35:59,220 --> 01:36:05,700
Yeah, I feel like when it comes to sombers, it's just like in in chat the shadow

1120
01:36:06,900 --> 01:36:09,460
The land of shadow. It's literally just a fucking

1121
01:36:12,260 --> 01:36:14,260
Like randomizer like here you go

1122
01:36:19,620 --> 01:36:22,980
Wait the bell bearing for the I didn't even unlock for a Missoula

1123
01:36:29,060 --> 01:36:31,060
Slap that in there

1124
01:36:34,020 --> 01:36:40,100
I didn't even bother with farm Missoula. It's like I hanging out by its loesome

1125
01:36:41,300 --> 01:36:44,660
Where's that black dot? Oh never mind. That's a thingy

1126
01:36:46,820 --> 01:36:52,340
And I also didn't even lock like the mount top of the giant it's because I was speed running shit

1127
01:36:55,540 --> 01:36:57,540
Um

1128
01:36:59,540 --> 01:37:01,540
I

1129
01:37:03,860 --> 01:37:05,860
Let me do a quick search

1130
01:37:22,900 --> 01:37:24,900
Excuse me

1131
01:37:29,060 --> 01:37:31,060
Oh

1132
01:37:44,500 --> 01:37:49,460
Okay, I see what you mean by the forge I wasn't I wasn't familiar with what you were talking about

1133
01:37:51,460 --> 01:37:55,060
Oh, I need to fucking press back on the screen. Um

1134
01:37:55,220 --> 01:38:04,100
Because it is I did I didn't go up. I never went up from the ancient ruins

1135
01:38:22,180 --> 01:38:24,180
Kind of want a burrito

1136
01:38:25,140 --> 01:38:27,140
I might get a burrito

1137
01:38:28,260 --> 01:38:30,260
A little burrito

1138
01:38:33,380 --> 01:38:35,380
It's dark

1139
01:38:36,740 --> 01:38:38,740
No

01:38:43,860 --> 01:38:46,740
Hello, good morning. Good morning

1141
01:38:49,460 --> 01:38:52,900
I can't see why is it so dark in this game

1142
01:38:55,780 --> 01:38:57,780
There's so many graves

1143
01:38:58,740 --> 01:39:04,340
Waiting for somebody to grab me and kill me. Good morning star sign the earth says. Oh, please

1150
01:39:51,140 --> 01:39:53,140
All right, who's gonna jump out

1151
01:39:53,460 --> 01:39:56,980
Why does this look like fall game? Oh wait? No, I was here. What?

1152
01:40:02,260 --> 01:40:04,260
What

1153
01:40:07,060 --> 01:40:09,060
No, I was in a different forge

1154
01:40:09,700 --> 01:40:11,700
Where was the other forge I was in before?

1155
01:40:12,900 --> 01:40:14,900
What the fuck this looks exactly the same

1156
01:40:16,180 --> 01:40:19,540
Um, I presume I do not to jump

1157
01:40:24,100 --> 01:40:26,100
Okay

1158
01:40:29,540 --> 01:40:31,860
Hit them where they're weakest the pee pee

1159
01:40:34,180 --> 01:40:36,180
Skadoosh

1160
01:40:47,220 --> 01:40:49,780
Yeah, I get to stand in lava without getting hurt

1161
01:40:53,140 --> 01:40:55,140
Okay, we got ourselves a ladder

1162
01:40:56,900 --> 01:40:58,900
Neat

1163
01:41:00,980 --> 01:41:04,820
Anybody over here anybody doing cool flame stuff

1164
01:41:08,100 --> 01:41:10,100
Nope

1165
01:41:11,540 --> 01:41:16,280
Wait, hold on. All right, look at this video. It's only a minute long

1166
01:41:23,220 --> 01:41:25,220
Okay, so they run and they go

1167
01:41:35,220 --> 01:41:40,820
Bro is running bro is jumping down. He might even use the ladder. He just flips off. What a fucking shad

1168
01:41:43,380 --> 01:41:45,380
Okay

1169
01:41:46,980 --> 01:41:49,220
Dump something goes up thing

1170
01:41:49,220 --> 01:41:51,220
Hmm

1171
01:41:52,500 --> 01:41:54,500
Looks to the side

1172
01:41:56,580 --> 01:41:58,580
Goes all the way to the top of the thingy

1173
01:42:00,820 --> 01:42:02,820
Oh, I see

1174
01:42:04,740 --> 01:42:06,740
Goes over there. All right

1175
01:42:10,020 --> 01:42:12,020
Walking walking walking

1176
01:42:15,540 --> 01:42:18,100
And our she goes all right

1177
01:42:19,540 --> 01:42:21,540
It's not that bad at all

1178
01:42:22,340 --> 01:42:24,340
Do some sick stuff, uh

1179
01:42:26,900 --> 01:42:29,380
Kind of surprised there's no enemies like attacking me right now

1180
01:42:34,420 --> 01:42:36,420
The only thing that's gonna attack me is myself

1181
01:42:39,300 --> 01:42:41,300
Because you went to the top of this here

1182
01:42:42,340 --> 01:42:44,100
You look down

1183
01:42:44,100 --> 01:42:46,100
Oh, what what's over there?

1184
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:49,540
There's a dude over there. I can want whatever that is. Is it red?

1185
01:42:50,660 --> 01:42:52,180
Looks red

1186
01:42:52,180 --> 01:42:54,180
Looks like it's yellow

1187
01:42:55,540 --> 01:42:57,540
Is that an enemy?

1188
01:43:01,300 --> 01:43:07,780
That didn't do jack shit to you. Uh, I shouldn't have woken you up. Should I?

1189
01:43:10,660 --> 01:43:13,380
Hey, oh there's two of you

1190
01:43:16,740 --> 01:43:18,740
Oh sick actually

1191
01:43:29,300 --> 01:43:31,940
I had 150 runes, when did that happen?

1192
01:43:34,980 --> 01:43:36,980
What the fuck

1193
01:43:40,420 --> 01:43:42,420
When me is passed out on my desk

1194
01:43:43,140 --> 01:43:45,140
All right

1195
01:43:47,460 --> 01:43:51,860
I would like my runes back, but I don't know how to get back up afterwards

1196
01:44:02,660 --> 01:44:06,740
He like did a jump roll off I was impressed with that skill

1197
01:44:06,740 --> 01:44:14,100
And you went down here and you jumped in girls

1198
01:44:19,700 --> 01:44:23,700
But how do you get back after you jump down because my

1199
01:44:25,540 --> 01:44:27,540
Where are my runes?

1200
01:44:28,580 --> 01:44:30,580
They're in there for some reason

1201
01:44:30,580 --> 01:44:40,260
Well, I can always go back for them. Wait, where did he go after this? I forget

1202
01:44:44,180 --> 01:44:49,860
You went up to the top here look over there. Oh, yeah, then he jumped over here. Yeah

1203
01:44:52,260 --> 01:44:57,700
And then can't I think he went straight down here. Yes, and there's a somber

1204
01:45:01,380 --> 01:45:03,380
Uh

1205
01:45:10,340 --> 01:45:13,220
That's not that bad. Okay, and then I can go get my runes

1206
01:45:15,460 --> 01:45:17,460
Yo

1207
01:45:19,540 --> 01:45:21,540
Yo

1208
01:45:31,060 --> 01:45:33,060
Hi

01:45:36,420 --> 01:45:39,140
There's a lot. Oh, um, this is awkward

1210
01:45:41,940 --> 01:45:43,940
Oh, what I don't know what's happening

1211
01:45:45,860 --> 01:45:47,860
Oh, um

1212
01:45:50,740 --> 01:45:53,940
What is up with this fucking sword? Oh my god, what?

1213

01:46:04,020 --> 01:46:06,020
Oh, no, I could have gone back up. Okay

1215
01:46:06,260 --> 01:46:08,260
I

1216
01:46:17,780 --> 01:46:25,620
Keep hitting the skill to do follow-ups interesting. Okay, I feel like I'm still not that strong

1217
01:46:26,580 --> 01:46:28,580

01:46:31,620 --> 01:46:37,220
Don't think so be enough cool jump super hero landing

1219
01:46:39,060 --> 01:46:42,180

1220
01:46:47,780 --> 01:46:49,780
Jump

1221
01:46:50,020 --> 01:46:52,020

I actually press the forward button

1226
01:47:44,820 --> 01:47:46,820
I'm doing silly stuff

1227
01:47:47,380 --> 01:47:54,900

1228
01:47:56,260 --> 01:47:58,260
That was silly silly mistake

1229
01:48:05,380 --> 01:48:12,500
Yeah, maybe I need to rescale because I think I'm like de-scaling to be honest with you

1230
01:48:16,820 --> 01:48:21,540
But I also just need to kill bosses so I can get better fucking better runes

1234
01:48:47,220 --> 01:48:49,220
Oh

1245
01:50:34,660 --> 01:50:36,660
What did you drop

1246
01:50:38,660 --> 01:50:40,660
A gas stone. Ooh

1247
01:50:41,460 --> 01:50:43,460
What they call me in middle school

1248
01:50:46,500 --> 01:50:48,500
I

1249
01:50:52,580 --> 01:50:54,580
Hello, welcome to harem emails

1250
01:50:58,660 --> 01:51:00,660
Gaston

1251
01:51:01,220 --> 01:51:03,220
Uh, all right

1252
01:51:03,940 --> 01:51:05,940
Let's go

1253
01:51:08,180 --> 01:51:10,180
Get me out of this cave

1254
01:51:11,140 --> 01:51:13,140
I

1255
01:51:16,180 --> 01:51:18,180
Something's gonna attack me

1256
01:51:21,860 --> 01:51:24,180
I can hear something making googly noises

1257
01:51:27,940 --> 01:51:29,940
No

1258
01:51:32,500 --> 01:51:34,740
Wait, I always go to the two fingers on accident

1259
01:51:37,780 --> 01:51:39,780
No, not you

1260
01:51:41,060 --> 01:51:43,060
I

1261
01:51:43,460 --> 01:51:45,460
No

1262
01:51:47,140 --> 01:51:49,140
Wait

1263
01:51:50,820 --> 01:51:52,820
Does this make a

1264
01:51:55,380 --> 01:52:01,620
Okay, I'm like does that make a difference I literally was here like five minutes ago

1265
01:52:07,460 --> 01:52:09,460
I need a nine

1266
01:52:11,140 --> 01:52:13,140
Okay, let me look it up

1267
01:52:13,460 --> 01:52:15,460
Oh

1268
01:52:38,740 --> 01:52:40,900
We're here for dog parents no, we're not

1269
01:52:43,540 --> 01:52:45,540
you

1270
01:53:03,620 --> 01:53:05,620
I

1271
01:53:06,740 --> 01:53:08,740
do

1272
01:53:13,140 --> 01:53:24,140
I think I grabbed the one...

1273
01:53:24,140 --> 01:53:29,140
What the fuck is he doing?

1274
01:53:29,140 --> 01:53:31,140
What is he doing?

1275
01:53:31,140 --> 01:53:34,140
No, I didn't scale the tree.

1276
01:53:34,140 --> 01:53:37,140
I mean, the thing.

1277
01:53:37,140 --> 01:53:44,140
I don't think I did actually go to this place for my nine.

1278
01:53:44,140 --> 01:53:46,140
Got the bail bearing.

1279
01:53:46,140 --> 01:53:51,140
Why? No, that requires me having to go kill people.

1280
01:53:51,140 --> 01:53:54,140
Hi, Shibi. It was nice meeting you in the club of Fuwa.

1281
01:53:54,140 --> 01:53:57,140
I wanted to support you, too, so it's lovely to be able to meet you.

1282
01:53:57,140 --> 01:54:02,140
Oh, thank you. Thank you for coming and checking me out again. Hi. Welcome back.

1283
01:54:02,140 --> 01:54:05,140
Keep working, Samar.

1284
01:54:05,140 --> 01:54:08,140
Oh, feel better. Feel better.

1285
01:54:08,140 --> 01:54:10,140
His headache sucked.

1286
01:54:10,140 --> 01:54:12,140
You know, go lay down.

1287
01:54:12,140 --> 01:54:16,140
My grating voice does not help.

1288
01:54:16,140 --> 01:54:22,140
Oh.

1289
01:54:22,140 --> 01:54:25,140
Meow. Meow.

1290
01:54:25,140 --> 01:54:30,140
What the? I can't see.

1291
01:54:30,140 --> 01:54:32,140
It's near a tree.

1292
01:54:32,140 --> 01:54:36,140
Is it over here? I forget. Oh.

1293
01:54:36,140 --> 01:54:52,140
Where on the map? Where on the map is it?

1294
01:54:52,140 --> 01:54:54,140
Okay, yes.

1295
01:54:54,140 --> 01:54:56,140
Somebody mentioned that...

1296
01:54:56,140 --> 01:55:00,140
Oh, there's a grace up here I just never got. That's so weird.

1297
01:55:01,140 --> 01:55:03,140
That's just so weird.

1298
01:55:21,140 --> 01:55:28,140
I didn't go over here, really, or grab the grace that's right here.

1299
01:55:28,140 --> 01:55:30,140
If you...

1300
01:55:40,140 --> 01:55:46,140
Well, if I need to upgrade another weapon, then if there's another bonus 8, then we'll have a great time.

1301
01:55:54,140 --> 01:55:57,140
Dragon.

1302
01:55:59,140 --> 01:56:01,140
Oh.

1303
01:56:01,140 --> 01:56:04,140
I'm even awake up in the morning. Oh, my God.

1304
01:56:04,140 --> 01:56:08,140
Don't hurt. Don't die. Thank God.

1305
01:56:13,140 --> 01:56:16,140
Don't also run off the cliff.

1306
01:56:16,140 --> 01:56:19,140
Yeah.

1307
01:56:30,140 --> 01:56:33,140
Hangin' out with the boys.

1308
01:56:38,140 --> 01:56:40,140
Yeah.

1309
01:56:46,140 --> 01:56:51,140
Why are they all just prayin'?

1310
01:56:51,140 --> 01:56:55,140
His dude fell out of his chair. That's too bad.

1311
01:57:06,140 --> 01:57:09,140
I just get the grace up here because I'm near it.

1312
01:57:09,140 --> 01:57:13,140
And I didn't grab any graces up here when I was doing my run.

1313
01:57:17,140 --> 01:57:21,140
Grab the map, but I didn't grab the grace. That doesn't make any sense to me.

1314
01:57:25,140 --> 01:57:27,140
Where is it?

1315
01:57:47,140 --> 01:57:49,140
Oh.

1316
01:57:57,140 --> 01:57:59,140
Pop a squat.

1317
01:58:02,140 --> 01:58:05,140
I don't know if I got hit or anything.

1318
01:58:08,140 --> 01:58:14,140
You spent 25 minutes beating it to death normally. Oh, no.

1319
01:58:14,140 --> 01:58:16,140
That sucked.

1320
01:58:18,140 --> 01:58:21,140
I could also cheese the guy over here.

1321
01:58:26,140 --> 01:58:28,140
On the bridge.

1322
01:58:29,140 --> 01:58:31,140
I didn't do that either.

1323
01:58:37,140 --> 01:58:40,140
No, I didn't unlock all the nerks.

1324
01:58:41,140 --> 01:58:44,140
How much do I need to level up?

1325
01:58:49,140 --> 01:58:51,140
Oh, perfect.

1326
01:58:51,140 --> 01:58:53,140
Intelligence.

1327
01:59:01,140 --> 01:59:05,140
The only thing that gives me like 70? I don't know. Not even.

1328
01:59:05,140 --> 01:59:08,140
It's not even gonna be there. It's not nighttime.

1329
01:59:09,140 --> 01:59:14,140
Albinarx's mo- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I did that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1330
01:59:15,140 --> 01:59:19,140
I did. I could- I don't feel like farming like that again. I don't-

1331
01:59:20,140 --> 01:59:24,140
I did that for four hours and I got four million runes. It was too long.

1332
01:59:33,140 --> 01:59:35,140
I was like, what am I doing?

1333
01:59:35,140 --> 01:59:40,140
I'm just gonna go to the- Nope, that's not what I meant to do. I'm just gonna go to the-

1334
01:59:43,140 --> 01:59:45,140
We're gonna have to toggle the thing first.

1335
01:59:50,140 --> 01:59:54,140
Hello, hi, welcome in. Maybe a lot of new faces in here today because it's-

1336
01:59:54,140 --> 01:59:58,140
I don't usually stream this early in the morning. I hope everybody is doing well.

1337
01:59:59,140 --> 02:00:02,140
I hope everybody is doing well. I know some Snow Berries are in the chat,

1338
02:00:02,140 --> 02:00:05,140
so I know if you want to go attend the member stream, please.

1339
02:00:05,140 --> 02:00:10,140
This is a reminder to go watch Icy's member stream and go watch the room with her.

1340
02:00:11,140 --> 02:00:15,140
And I hope you have a lovely time with Icy, my lovely Snow Berries.

1341
02:00:19,140 --> 02:00:23,140
Am I gonna have enough rooms to level this? I don't even know.

1342
02:00:28,140 --> 02:00:30,140
Quite expensive. Oh.

1343
02:00:32,140 --> 02:00:39,140
I don't have a somber agent-dragging smithing stone.

1344
02:01:03,140 --> 02:01:11,140
I thought she's about doing a member's watch along. I don't know. I can't think right now, bro.

1345
02:01:18,140 --> 02:01:22,140
How do I not have a somber smithing stone 5? I thought I- whatever.

1346
02:01:23,140 --> 02:01:28,140
Oh, I have to- okay.

1347
02:01:30,140 --> 02:01:35,140
Nah, I don't really care about that too much. It's at 9, so that's fine, I guess.

1348
02:01:37,140 --> 02:01:42,140
I need to level my intelligence because look how it scales. The scale is fucking D.

1349
02:01:44,140 --> 02:01:46,140
Yeah, I don't need a plus 10.

1350
02:01:53,140 --> 02:01:56,140
I'm kind of- I'm kind of- can I?

1351
02:01:57,140 --> 02:02:02,140
I wanted to use my classical wonder psychic so I could see what it scales when I use it.

1352
02:02:03,140 --> 02:02:05,140
Some more decks.

1353
02:02:06,140 --> 02:02:07,140
Yeah.

1354
02:02:10,140 --> 02:02:11,140
Wait.

1355
02:02:12,140 --> 02:02:22,140
This is bigger than Limgrave. It looks like a hand. A little fingy's coming out.

1356
02:02:25,140 --> 02:02:39,140
Okay, so he wants me to go all the way over here and then go all the way around, all the way up here.

1357
02:02:41,140 --> 02:02:47,140
Go up this here. Go across here and then go over here.

1358
02:02:50,140 --> 02:02:54,140
I can dual wield the moon veil. Do I have the dual wield- do I have the dual?

1359
02:02:55,140 --> 02:03:00,140
I don't think I have the dual wielding medallion because then I would throw that on. What the fuck am I doing?

1360
02:03:01,140 --> 02:03:03,140
Pressing the wrong button, that's what the fuck I'm doing.

1361
02:03:08,140 --> 02:03:10,140
Interesting.

1362
02:03:12,140 --> 02:03:13,140
Cool.

1363
02:03:15,140 --> 02:03:17,140
Yeah, I have two hand and sword spellmen.

1364
02:03:23,140 --> 02:03:24,140
What that?

1365
02:03:31,140 --> 02:03:33,140
I like how pretty that looks. It's so pretty.

1366
02:03:33,140 --> 02:03:34,140
Pretty.

1367
02:03:40,140 --> 02:03:49,140
Let's do- I don't know if it'll be too heavy. It might be heavy load if I try to dual wield.

1368
02:03:58,140 --> 02:03:59,140
Yeah.

1369
02:04:04,140 --> 02:04:13,140
If I might- I might leave that as is then.

1370
02:04:13,140 --> 02:04:20,140
It's- it's- it's- It's not as heavy as it is then.

1371
02:04:32,140 --> 02:04:37,140
Shut up, guys. I hate that I just look so unfashionable during all of this.

1372
02:04:38,140 --> 02:04:40,140
I'm just- I'm just a big boy.

1373
02:04:40,140 --> 02:04:42,140
...

1374
02:04:42,140 --> 02:04:44,200
ppupupupupupupupupupupupupupupupupup!

1375
02:04:49,400 --> 02:04:58,400
Ibi-bi-bi-bi.

1376
02:05:03,040 --> 02:05:05,100
You have a child...

1377
02:05:05,100 --> 02:05:06,320
...

1378
02:05:06,320 --> 02:05:08,440
who is bluzzy.

1379
02:05:08,440 --> 02:05:10,440
He stretch

1380
02:05:10,680 --> 02:05:12,880
Like it the chin scratchies

1381
02:05:14,920 --> 02:05:16,920
You like the chin scratchies?

1382
02:05:20,680 --> 02:05:24,160
All big yon from the big man you gonna dust again

1383
02:05:38,440 --> 02:05:40,440
That's me

1384
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:49,800
He's doing fine fire this morning snuggle played a little bit just curled up in her bed napping

1385
02:05:56,760 --> 02:05:59,080
This is for mortal posh like me. I

1386
02:06:02,520 --> 02:06:07,040
Don't know. I don't know anything. I don't I'm not looking. I'm not paying attention to stats. I just want cool stuff

1387
02:06:07,040 --> 02:06:09,040
I just want to be fashionable

1388
02:06:14,400 --> 02:06:16,400
Okay

1389
02:06:32,800 --> 02:06:34,800
Okay, you did that

1390
02:06:37,040 --> 02:06:40,440
Why do you have six million rooms just sitting in the bank?

1391
02:06:46,040 --> 02:06:48,040
Yes, I got that

1392
02:07:07,440 --> 02:07:18,320
Okay, we got to go through the dragon's pit

1393
02:07:33,120 --> 02:07:36,320
I don't think I'm strong enough to kill Rinali at Rilano

1394
02:07:37,120 --> 02:07:39,120
I can try but I'm just gonna

1395
02:07:44,240 --> 02:07:52,400
What is that is that a marionette? I don't even know anybody down here. Yeah, this is a dog

1396
02:07:55,280 --> 02:07:58,400
Oh, it's Beastman's it's Beastman's

1397
02:08:00,240 --> 02:08:02,240
Oh

02:08:07,120 --> 02:08:12,960
Oh, I didn't mean to rock off you like that. Oh, you're I you're really strong. I'm gonna run away now

1399
02:08:29,600 --> 02:08:32,000
This is nice, this is cool out

02:08:32,560 --> 02:08:37,120
This is cool. This is nice. Is anything in here that I can have like a cool weapon

1401
02:08:41,360 --> 02:08:43,360
Oh, I'm scratching my nose

1402
02:08:44,880 --> 02:08:46,880
I'm scratching my nose

1403
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:54,800
I'm stuck I'm stuck these it's not very nice

1404
02:09:02,240 --> 02:09:04,240

02:09:05,840 --> 02:09:12,560
It chasing me this is cool. I like this area. Is that a boss over there?

1406
02:09:18,640 --> 02:09:20,640
Where am I

1407
02:09:22,480 --> 02:09:24,480
I can't go down way

1408
02:09:28,080 --> 02:09:30,080
Anybody around

1409
02:09:31,040 --> 02:09:33,040
No, okay

1410
02:09:39,520 --> 02:09:41,520
Hello

1411
02:09:56,640 --> 02:09:58,640
Be brave show no fear

1412
02:10:00,160 --> 02:10:02,160
Are you asking me to jump off?

1413
02:10:03,840 --> 02:10:05,840
Do I jump off?

1414
02:10:09,520 --> 02:10:11,520
No

1415
02:10:13,200 --> 02:10:18,640
That's not the focus right now, I don't want to have to run it back all around all these guys again

1416
02:10:20,480 --> 02:10:22,480
No

1417
02:10:30,080 --> 02:10:32,080
I

1418
02:10:38,320 --> 02:10:40,320
Not

1419
02:10:42,560 --> 02:10:44,560
No

1420
02:10:55,280 --> 02:10:59,440
Not the fucking worm not the worm I didn't want to deal with the worm

1421
02:11:00,640 --> 02:11:02,640
I

1422
02:11:03,040 --> 02:11:05,040
All right, anyways

1423
02:11:12,800 --> 02:11:15,840
What's that song by like is it called a cake?

1424
02:11:17,840 --> 02:11:19,840
She's going the distance

1425
02:11:20,480 --> 02:11:22,480
She's going for speed

1426
02:11:23,120 --> 02:11:28,080
And I'm going and I'm zooming and I'm going and I don't even know when I'm going and I don't

1427
02:11:31,040 --> 02:11:33,040
She's going the distance

1428
02:11:37,040 --> 02:11:40,000
Yeah cake of the band run

1429
02:11:42,240 --> 02:11:44,240
Run

1430
02:11:45,120 --> 02:11:47,120
Run

1431
02:11:47,840 --> 02:11:49,840
Okay, there's a worm

1432
02:11:52,160 --> 02:11:54,160
Where is it

1433
02:11:54,960 --> 02:11:56,960
Oh

1434
02:11:59,760 --> 02:12:01,760
Can I please get up

1435
02:12:06,480 --> 02:12:12,000
Why the fuck can I stand like I don't know why all my animations take so long for me to move I don't

1436
02:12:13,680 --> 02:12:17,120
Would you love us if you were a worm as long as you don't hurt me

1437
02:12:18,160 --> 02:12:21,680
Then yes, but if you're a mean worm, then I don't know

1438
02:12:25,120 --> 02:12:27,120
That's where I go

1439
02:12:31,120 --> 02:12:33,120
I don't even know if I'm going the right way

1440
02:12:37,920 --> 02:12:39,920
Out

1441
02:12:47,040 --> 02:12:51,600
I wish there was a steak america worm is optional. Okay, that's what I thought

1442
02:12:54,560 --> 02:13:01,520
It's literally just fucking rocking my shit every time I walk in

1443
02:13:05,200 --> 02:13:09,120
Wish I could cast invisibility, but I do not use incantations

1444
02:13:17,360 --> 02:13:20,960
No, no, no, no, no, no

1445
02:13:24,400 --> 02:13:28,400
No, no, oh

1446
02:13:32,720 --> 02:13:41,760
What the fuck just happened I don't even did I just go in a fucking circle I did

1447
02:13:44,480 --> 02:13:46,480
I'm a little confused

1448
02:13:48,640 --> 02:13:50,640
Do I need a jump in the hole

1449
02:13:54,160 --> 02:13:56,160
I

1450
02:14:16,960 --> 02:14:21,280
It's the right way but how do I get past them

1451
02:14:24,160 --> 02:14:26,160
I

1452
02:14:47,760 --> 02:14:51,120
The one that said be brave. Oh, okay. All right

1453
02:14:51,120 --> 02:14:54,720
To the brave hole away

1454
02:15:22,080 --> 02:15:27,520
I'm gonna need a lore explanation for that because that doesn't make any sense

1455
02:15:32,800 --> 02:15:37,920
Uh, I didn't land in water I literally landed in fucking sand

1456
02:15:41,440 --> 02:15:43,440
That doesn't make any sense

1457
02:15:45,680 --> 02:15:47,680
I have to kill a boss

1458
02:15:52,080 --> 02:15:56,160
Oh, buddy, who are you ancient dragon, man

1459
02:16:07,600 --> 02:16:09,600
What the fuck was that?

1460
02:16:16,240 --> 02:16:18,240
Oh fucking went into that

1461
02:16:18,240 --> 02:16:20,240
Oh

1462
02:16:20,800 --> 02:16:22,800
No

1463
02:16:25,120 --> 02:16:27,120
Why did I try to cast

1464
02:16:30,320 --> 02:16:32,320
He is terrible poise

1465
02:16:33,520 --> 02:16:36,960
Okay, I can beat him. I can beat this guy. Okay, this is fine

1466
02:16:39,040 --> 02:16:43,600
Okay, this is he gravity. Oh fuck. Yay sweet stake america

1467
02:16:44,560 --> 02:16:47,600
I was gonna say I'm like if I have to keep running through that

1468
02:16:49,520 --> 02:16:51,520
Lightsaber fight

1469
02:16:58,480 --> 02:17:02,240
Has even more follow-ups if I mash. Yeah

1470
02:17:04,800 --> 02:17:06,800
Oh

1471
02:17:07,520 --> 02:17:13,520
I I thought I was on the animation I was

1472
02:17:18,160 --> 02:17:20,880
I'm trying to mash but it's not really working

1473
02:17:26,400 --> 02:17:28,960
You die to this guy more to the first DLC boss

1474
02:17:29,520 --> 02:17:34,640
Well, I'm about to die to this guy more than the first DLC boss, but I use my summons for the DLC boss

1475
02:17:35,600 --> 02:17:38,720
The first one for the thing and that's why I was able to beat him so fast

1476
02:17:39,520 --> 02:17:41,520
Mash the skill button

1477
02:17:43,040 --> 02:17:45,040
What do you mean

1478
02:18:04,800 --> 02:18:06,800
I

1479
02:18:17,600 --> 02:18:19,600
I'm confused

1480
02:18:21,840 --> 02:18:23,840
Hit l2

1481
02:18:25,600 --> 02:18:27,600
What the fuck

1482
02:18:27,920 --> 02:18:29,920
Whoa

1483
02:18:30,480 --> 02:18:35,120
I was pressing the wrong thing. Holy shit. Um

1484
02:18:41,440 --> 02:18:43,440
Sick

1485
02:18:44,640 --> 02:18:49,840
I'm gonna get ya. I'm gonna get ya. I'm gonna get ya. I'm gonna get ya. I'm gonna get start throwing away for me

1486
02:18:51,040 --> 02:18:53,040
That's enough. Come here

1487
02:18:54,560 --> 02:18:58,320
I have something to tell you come. Yeah just like that

1488
02:19:00,880 --> 02:19:02,880
Yeah, all right

1489
02:19:25,840 --> 02:19:27,840
Oh he rolled out of the fucking way

1490
02:19:30,080 --> 02:19:32,080
Ah

1491
02:19:32,400 --> 02:19:35,120
I realized they have like really cool animations

1492
02:19:36,880 --> 02:19:38,880
For um

1493
02:19:44,160 --> 02:19:46,160
For um

1494
02:19:49,040 --> 02:19:56,320
What oh, I wasn't looking at my health. Um, they have really cool animations for a lot of the weapons like I know for midras that um

1495
02:19:56,320 --> 02:20:03,360
When in midra with midra's sword, it's pretty sick

1496
02:20:10,720 --> 02:20:17,840
Like I like that you you it's like grab to sword grab I want to I want to probably get also

1497
02:20:19,600 --> 02:20:23,920
Uh plus 10 midra sword or late plus nine on these

1498
02:20:26,320 --> 02:20:28,320
Oh

1499
02:20:56,320 --> 02:21:03,320
You're, like, really far away, I don't mean.

1500
02:21:03,320 --> 02:21:19,720
Oh, you can heal, too?

1501
02:21:19,720 --> 02:21:25,520
You fucking son of a bitch.

1502
02:21:25,520 --> 02:21:27,520
It only works on tarnished?

1503
02:21:27,520 --> 02:21:28,520
What?

1504
02:21:28,520 --> 02:21:29,520
Really?

1505
02:21:29,520 --> 02:21:30,520
Not stupid.

1506
02:21:30,520 --> 02:21:32,520
Squeeze the pouch for good luck.

1507
02:21:32,520 --> 02:21:37,520
Thank you, boomi.

1508
02:21:37,520 --> 02:21:38,520
What?

1509
02:21:38,520 --> 02:22:04,520
I pressed the button, but I suppose my timing was off.

1510
02:22:34,520 --> 02:23:03,520
What the fuck?

1511
02:23:03,520 --> 02:23:28,520
What the fuck?

1512
02:23:28,520 --> 02:23:38,520
He's easy.

1513
02:23:38,520 --> 02:23:39,520
He's easy, bro.

1514
02:23:39,520 --> 02:23:44,520
He's literally so easy.

1515
02:23:44,520 --> 02:23:49,520
He's so easy.

1516
02:23:49,520 --> 02:23:52,520
He's so easy.

1517
02:23:52,520 --> 02:23:54,520
He's so easy.

1518
02:23:54,520 --> 02:24:08,520
I was getting my timing wrong.

1519
02:24:08,520 --> 02:24:14,520
Oh, I forgot to spam.

1520
02:24:14,520 --> 02:24:16,520
Ow.

1521
02:24:16,520 --> 02:24:38,520
Are you so fast for no reason?

1522
02:24:38,520 --> 02:24:47,520
Someone is vacuuming the hallway.

1523
02:24:47,520 --> 02:24:57,520
Can you do a dragon thing, please, so I can heal?

1524
02:24:57,520 --> 02:25:04,520
That works.

1525
02:25:04,520 --> 02:25:20,520
Come on, you're not even hard.

1526
02:25:20,520 --> 02:25:24,520
I'm just playing stupid, though.

1527
02:25:24,520 --> 02:25:25,520
He's naked?

1528
02:25:25,520 --> 02:25:26,520
Oh, yeah.

1529
02:25:26,520 --> 02:25:29,520
I heard that you can be a dragon.

1530
02:25:29,520 --> 02:25:32,520
Here we go, Talisman.

1531
02:25:32,520 --> 02:25:50,520
What would that be?

1532
02:25:50,520 --> 02:26:03,520
Sometimes I think he's going to do this attack, and then he doesn't do it, and then he stabs me.

1533
02:26:03,520 --> 02:26:22,520
No, no.

1534
02:26:22,520 --> 02:26:34,520
How did you...you have a very long range.

1535
02:26:34,520 --> 02:26:37,520
He's not even good.

1536
02:26:37,520 --> 02:26:39,520
Like, it's not a hard boss.

1537
02:26:39,520 --> 02:27:04,520
He literally isn't...it's not even a hard boss.

1538
02:27:34,520 --> 02:27:48,520
I'm rolling at the wrong time.

1539
02:27:48,520 --> 02:27:58,520
No.

1540
02:27:58,520 --> 02:28:10,520
Nice.

1541
02:28:10,520 --> 02:28:14,520
What the fuck was that spam?

1542
02:28:14,520 --> 02:28:22,520
He just R2 spammed me.

1543
02:28:22,520 --> 02:28:24,520
Did you see that shit?

1544
02:28:24,520 --> 02:28:25,520
I'm trash, bro.

1545
02:28:25,520 --> 02:28:26,520
I'm literally trash.

1546
02:28:26,520 --> 02:28:37,520
All right.

1547
02:28:37,520 --> 02:29:04,520
Tula, let's go.

1548
02:29:04,520 --> 02:29:21,520
You hear me cracking my shit? Let's go.

1549
02:29:21,520 --> 02:29:23,520
Boomi, it's because you left.

1550
02:29:23,520 --> 02:29:27,520
You're my lucky charm.

1551
02:29:27,520 --> 02:29:29,520
Oh, why don't I do this?

1552
02:29:29,520 --> 02:29:34,520
I'm so stupid.

1553
02:29:34,520 --> 02:29:41,520
Duh.

1554
02:30:04,520 --> 02:30:14,520
Duh.

1555
02:30:14,520 --> 02:30:24,520
Duh.

1556
02:30:24,520 --> 02:30:34,520
Duh.

1557
02:30:34,520 --> 02:30:44,520
Duh.

1558
02:30:44,520 --> 02:30:54,520
Duh.

1559
02:30:54,520 --> 02:31:04,520
Duh.

1560
02:31:04,520 --> 02:31:14,520
Duh.

1561
02:31:14,520 --> 02:31:24,520
Duh.

1562
02:31:24,520 --> 02:31:34,520
Duh.

1563
02:31:34,520 --> 02:31:54,520
Duh.

1564
02:31:54,520 --> 02:32:03,520
So that's what happens when I actually lock in brothers.

1565
02:32:03,520 --> 02:32:10,520
That's what happens.

1566
02:32:10,520 --> 02:32:13,520
I should have beat him like two tries ago.

1567
02:32:13,520 --> 02:32:22,520
Or this.

1568
02:32:22,520 --> 02:32:27,520
Yippee.

1569
02:32:27,520 --> 02:32:47,520
I don't like the hands on those dragons.

1570
02:32:47,520 --> 02:32:52,520
I think I have to pee.

1571
02:32:52,520 --> 02:32:55,520
It's a pee break.

1572
02:32:55,520 --> 02:32:57,520
The new sword's pretty sick.

1573
02:32:57,520 --> 02:33:10,520
It's a good sword for me because I can just spam stuff.

1574
02:33:10,520 --> 02:33:39,520
I have PRB.

1575
02:33:39,520 --> 02:33:49,520
I have PRB.

1576
02:33:49,520 --> 02:33:59,520
I have PRB.

1577
02:33:59,520 --> 02:34:09,520
I have PRB.

1578
02:34:09,520 --> 02:34:19,520
I have PRB.

1579
02:34:19,520 --> 02:34:29,520
I have PRB.

1580
02:34:29,520 --> 02:34:39,520
I have PRB.

1581
02:34:39,520 --> 02:34:49,520
I have PRB.

1582
02:34:49,520 --> 02:34:59,520
I have PRB.

1583
02:34:59,520 --> 02:35:09,520
I have PRB.

1584
02:35:09,520 --> 02:35:19,520
I have PRB.

1585
02:35:19,520 --> 02:35:29,520
I have PRB.

1586
02:35:29,520 --> 02:35:39,520
I have PRB.

1587
02:35:39,520 --> 02:35:49,520
I have PRB.

1588
02:35:49,520 --> 02:35:59,520
I have PRB.

1589
02:35:59,520 --> 02:36:09,520
I have PRB.

1590
02:36:09,520 --> 02:36:19,520
I have PRB.

1591
02:36:19,520 --> 02:36:29,520
I have PRB.

1592
02:36:29,520 --> 02:36:57,520
I have PRB.

1593
02:36:57,520 --> 02:36:59,520
Hello, sorry.

1594
02:36:59,520 --> 02:37:03,520
I was flipping the pancake kitty.

1595
02:37:03,520 --> 02:37:13,520
And now I'm moving for a snack.

1596
02:37:13,520 --> 02:37:23,520
I didn't really buy these snacks when I went out for groceries.

1597
02:37:23,520 --> 02:37:45,520
I'm probably going to stop at a certain time to eat before I do make lunches out of a snack.

1598
02:37:45,520 --> 02:37:51,520
That's true, it is so forwardy.

1599
02:37:51,520 --> 02:37:53,520
I really want a burrito now.

1600
02:37:53,520 --> 02:37:55,520
I've gotten in my head.

1601
02:37:55,520 --> 02:37:57,520
No Grace left alive.

1602
02:37:57,520 --> 02:37:59,520
Did somebody gift while I was peeing?

1603
02:37:59,520 --> 02:38:09,520
Who was it?

1604
02:38:09,520 --> 02:38:15,520
All the Grace went back to hiding, to lurking.

1605
02:38:15,520 --> 02:38:17,520
Don't worry, I still care about you.

1606
02:38:17,520 --> 02:38:19,520
I care about all of my children.

1607
02:38:19,520 --> 02:38:21,520
Not gift, join.

1608
02:38:21,520 --> 02:38:23,520
Oh nice, welcome.

1609
02:38:23,520 --> 02:38:39,520
Welcome new emotes tier or members.

1610
02:38:39,520 --> 02:38:41,520
Conducted a soul to the emotes?

1611
02:38:41,520 --> 02:38:43,520
What does that mean?

1612
02:38:43,520 --> 02:39:03,520
Oh my god, boomi.

1613
02:39:03,520 --> 02:39:19,520
Except for thing?

1614
02:39:19,520 --> 02:39:21,520
Oh do you mean the turtle talisman?

1615
02:39:21,520 --> 02:39:27,520
Is that what you mean?

1616
02:39:27,520 --> 02:39:43,520
I'm just staring at chat.

1617
02:39:43,520 --> 02:39:49,520
You can't eat the crumbs from the skull.

1618
02:39:49,520 --> 02:40:09,520
Except my two top children.

1619
02:40:09,520 --> 02:40:11,520
Newly improved.

1620
02:40:11,520 --> 02:40:37,520
It's a two headed turtle.

1621
02:40:37,520 --> 02:40:41,520
Well there's two that died.

1622
02:40:41,520 --> 02:40:43,520
Yeah, wait hold on.

1623
02:40:43,520 --> 02:40:47,520
The first one, let me look.

1624
02:40:47,520 --> 02:40:51,520
This one, every time it just keeps acting.

1625
02:40:51,520 --> 02:40:53,520
I feed it and I give it toys to play with

1626
02:40:53,520 --> 02:40:55,520
and it ends up being sick in like an hour.

1627
02:40:55,520 --> 02:40:57,520
I don't understand.

1628
02:40:57,520 --> 02:40:59,520
I just have a sickly ugly child.

1629
02:40:59,520 --> 02:41:01,520
I don't.

1630
02:41:01,520 --> 02:41:05,520
Okay if I go to status and I go to profile.

1631
02:41:05,520 --> 02:41:17,520
So where are the past Thomas?

1632
02:41:17,520 --> 02:41:21,520
How do I look at the past Thomas?

1633
02:41:21,520 --> 02:41:25,520
It's not showing me.

1634
02:41:25,520 --> 02:41:31,520
Some of the stuff is in a weird fucking spot.

1635
02:41:31,520 --> 02:41:33,520
I don't even remember where the past Thomas are.

1636
02:41:33,520 --> 02:41:35,520
Oh here it is.

1637
02:41:35,520 --> 02:41:41,520
So I had Goza Ruchi and Yume Miti.

1638
02:41:41,520 --> 02:41:47,520
Yume Miti died sad and so did Goza Ruchi.

1639
02:41:47,520 --> 02:41:51,520
But I took care of Yume Miti.

1640
02:41:51,520 --> 02:41:55,520
Because I made them into pecorra.

1641
02:41:55,520 --> 02:41:57,520
Now I want a pecorra.

1642
02:41:57,520 --> 02:41:59,520
You know it's like a food?

1643
02:41:59,520 --> 02:42:13,520
It's pretty tasty.

1644
02:42:13,520 --> 02:42:15,520
I think it's a zit on my shoulder.

1645
02:42:15,520 --> 02:42:23,520
What the fuck?

1646
02:42:23,520 --> 02:42:27,520
And then there's what's this one called?

1647
02:42:27,520 --> 02:42:33,520
This one's called Saberichi.

1648
02:42:33,520 --> 02:42:35,520
No I didn't. I didn't make them into marine.

1649
02:42:35,520 --> 02:42:39,520
I never dressed them up as marine.

1650
02:42:39,520 --> 02:42:41,520
VTuber Enjoyer. What has happened so far?

1651
02:42:41,520 --> 02:42:45,520
There's a cry here! Everybody jump on him!

1652
02:42:45,520 --> 02:42:47,520
Jump on him!

1653
02:42:47,520 --> 02:42:49,520
Kill him!

1654
02:42:49,520 --> 02:43:09,520
I'm kidding.

1655
02:43:09,520 --> 02:43:11,520
Okay now you're fine.

1656
02:43:11,520 --> 02:43:13,520
Bro you're fine bro.

1657
02:43:13,520 --> 02:43:15,520
You're fine. Don't worry about it.

1658
02:43:15,520 --> 02:43:17,520
We're just messing with you.

1659
02:43:17,520 --> 02:43:23,520
You always bully the newcomers.

1660
02:43:23,520 --> 02:43:31,520
You bully them with affection.

1661
02:43:31,520 --> 02:43:33,520
Alright.

1662
02:43:33,520 --> 02:43:35,520
It's just called a deer.

1663
02:43:35,520 --> 02:43:37,520
We kid deer. It was old lady voice.

1664
02:43:37,520 --> 02:43:41,520
We kid deer.

1665
02:43:41,520 --> 02:43:43,520
I'm generally surprised with this Pokemon.

1666
02:43:43,520 --> 02:43:45,520
This Tamagotchi hasn't died yet.

1667
02:43:45,520 --> 02:43:47,520
I just want it to die so I can move on to the next one.

1668
02:43:47,520 --> 02:43:49,520
Because this one I just can't stand.

1669
02:43:49,520 --> 02:43:53,520
Because I do everything for it.

1670
02:43:53,520 --> 02:43:57,520
Oh you still got one that was talking a lot.

1671
02:43:57,520 --> 02:43:59,520
Now they're lurking. Good job.

1672
02:43:59,520 --> 02:44:03,520
Thank you no one special for the gifted.

1673
02:44:03,520 --> 02:44:05,520
Why does she bully us?

1674
02:44:05,520 --> 02:44:07,520
I don't know.

1675
02:44:07,520 --> 02:44:11,520
I'm the dom of the deer.

1676
02:44:11,520 --> 02:44:13,520
Your girl failure dog.

1677
02:44:13,520 --> 02:44:15,520
What the foot of the dragon peak.

1678
02:44:15,520 --> 02:44:21,520
Alright.

1679
02:44:21,520 --> 02:44:23,520
He said...

1680
02:44:23,520 --> 02:44:25,520
So I did that.

1681
02:44:25,520 --> 02:44:29,520
Got that grace and I have to go around...

1682
02:44:29,520 --> 02:44:31,520
To the dragon.

1683
02:44:31,520 --> 02:44:33,520
Oh shit. That looks kind of crazy.

1684
02:44:33,520 --> 02:44:37,520
There's a lot of dragons here.

1685
02:44:37,520 --> 02:44:39,520
Alright.

1686
02:44:39,520 --> 02:44:43,520
There's going to be more dragons here.

1687
02:44:43,520 --> 02:44:45,520
I...

1688
02:44:45,520 --> 02:44:47,520
I think we should hop on a horse.

1689
02:44:47,520 --> 02:44:49,520
Where? I thought I rested at that side of grace.

1690
02:44:49,520 --> 02:44:51,520
I suppose I did not?

1691
02:44:51,520 --> 02:44:59,520
Question mark?

1692
02:44:59,520 --> 02:45:01,520
Yes but even me.

1693
02:45:01,520 --> 02:45:03,520
Even with no twists and turns?

1694
02:45:03,520 --> 02:45:07,520
I will get lost.

1695
02:45:07,520 --> 02:45:09,520
I will get lost.

1696
02:45:09,520 --> 02:45:17,520
I thought you would know this about me already.

1697
02:45:17,520 --> 02:45:21,520
Ladies and gentlemen we have been joined by Reina.

1698
02:45:21,520 --> 02:45:25,520
Hello Miss Chunk.

1699
02:45:25,520 --> 02:45:27,520
Hi.

1700
02:45:27,520 --> 02:45:29,520
Are you going to lay down so I have a place to put my headphones?

1701
02:45:29,520 --> 02:45:31,520
Because like you're...

1702
02:45:31,520 --> 02:45:35,520
You're going to lay on top of my headphones and then pull them out which I don't want.

1703
02:45:35,520 --> 02:45:37,520
Hi.

1704
02:45:37,520 --> 02:45:39,520
Where are you smelling my breath?

1705
02:45:39,520 --> 02:45:41,520
Do I need to brush my teeth?

1706
02:45:41,520 --> 02:45:43,520
I haven't brushed my teeth today so...

1707
02:45:43,520 --> 02:45:45,520
I would be understandable.

1708
02:45:45,520 --> 02:45:49,520
Okay.

1709
02:45:49,520 --> 02:45:51,520
What the fuck?

1710
02:45:51,520 --> 02:45:55,520
Fucking...

1711
02:45:55,520 --> 02:45:57,520
Reina what was that?

1712
02:45:57,520 --> 02:45:59,520
She just did a whole loop.

1713
02:45:59,520 --> 02:46:01,520
Do you loop on my chest?

1714
02:46:01,520 --> 02:46:03,520
Slash tummy.

1715
02:46:03,520 --> 02:46:05,520
Pet pet pet pet.

1716
02:46:05,520 --> 02:46:07,520
Pet pet pet.

1717
02:46:07,520 --> 02:46:09,520
Do you want a smooch?

1718
02:46:09,520 --> 02:46:11,520
There's your smooch.

1719
02:46:15,520 --> 02:46:17,520
We're just...

1720
02:46:17,520 --> 02:46:19,520
We're just getting scottotree fragments.

1721
02:46:19,520 --> 02:46:21,520
And I just got a sword.

1722
02:46:21,520 --> 02:46:23,520
Yep.

1723
02:46:23,520 --> 02:46:25,520
I can't get torrent yet.

1724
02:46:25,520 --> 02:46:27,520
What am I doing?

1725
02:46:27,520 --> 02:46:29,520
You mean...

1726
02:46:29,520 --> 02:46:31,520
Torrent.

1727
02:46:31,520 --> 02:46:33,520
Thank you.

1728
02:46:35,520 --> 02:46:37,520
Frag out!

1729
02:46:39,520 --> 02:46:41,520
Okay.

1730
02:46:41,520 --> 02:46:43,520
So...

1731
02:46:43,520 --> 02:46:45,520
We just go down here.

1732
02:46:45,520 --> 02:46:47,520
Then we loop around.

1733
02:46:47,520 --> 02:46:49,520
We got some...

1734
02:46:49,520 --> 02:46:51,520
Weird fucking looking dragons here.

1735
02:46:51,520 --> 02:46:53,520
Oh I have a lot of money.

1736
02:46:53,520 --> 02:46:55,520
I have a lot of money.

1737
02:46:57,520 --> 02:46:59,520
Hold on.

1738
02:47:07,520 --> 02:47:09,520
What did you guys suggest that I put?

1739
02:47:09,520 --> 02:47:11,520
Not that it matters.

1740
02:47:11,520 --> 02:47:13,520
I can always respect.

1741
02:47:13,520 --> 02:47:15,520
But like...

1742
02:47:15,520 --> 02:47:17,520
Should I put...

1743
02:47:17,520 --> 02:47:19,520
it?

1744
02:47:21,520 --> 02:47:23,520
Why is everything turning yellow?

1745
02:47:23,520 --> 02:47:25,520
What does that mean?

1746
02:47:25,520 --> 02:47:27,520
Am I maxed out?

1747
02:47:31,520 --> 02:47:33,520
That's interesting.

1748
02:47:39,520 --> 02:47:41,520
Should I put it into...

1749
02:47:41,520 --> 02:47:43,520
Oh.

1750
02:47:43,520 --> 02:47:45,520
It's in the DC land.

1751
02:47:47,520 --> 02:47:49,520
Okay.

1752
02:47:49,520 --> 02:47:51,520
Got you.

1753
02:47:51,520 --> 02:47:53,520
I didn't know that.

1754
02:47:53,520 --> 02:47:55,520
Nifty.

1755
02:47:55,520 --> 02:47:57,520
60 vigor?

1756
02:47:57,520 --> 02:47:59,520
Yeah.

1757
02:47:59,520 --> 02:48:01,520
Should I just try to work up to 60 vigor?

1758
02:48:05,520 --> 02:48:07,520
Or should I get a little bit more int?

1759
02:48:11,520 --> 02:48:13,520
Or a little bit more dex?

1760
02:48:17,520 --> 02:48:19,520
So vigor should be 60.

1761
02:48:19,520 --> 02:48:21,520
Let's do it then boys.

1762
02:48:21,520 --> 02:48:23,520
Everybody...

1763
02:48:23,520 --> 02:48:25,520
Everybody wants me to do the...

1764
02:48:25,520 --> 02:48:27,520
My ear is itchy.

1765
02:48:27,520 --> 02:48:29,520
Rena's resting on my arm. Hold on.

1766
02:48:37,520 --> 02:48:39,520
Are you guys having a good morning?

1767
02:48:39,520 --> 02:48:41,520
I hope you're productive.

1768
02:48:41,520 --> 02:48:43,520
I hope you're productive with me in the background.

1769
02:48:43,520 --> 02:48:45,520
Hope Rena doesn't chew on my fucking headphones.

1770
02:48:45,520 --> 02:48:47,520
I don't think she's noticed them yet.

1771
02:48:47,520 --> 02:48:49,520
Thank God.

1772
02:48:49,520 --> 02:48:51,520
They're like ripable her neck.

1773
02:48:51,520 --> 02:48:53,520
And cats can't really see you right in front of them.

1774
02:48:53,520 --> 02:48:55,520
So it's a little bit difficult.

1775
02:49:01,520 --> 02:49:03,520
What? I was looking at my cat

1776
02:49:03,520 --> 02:49:05,520
and I didn't see what direction I was running in.

1777
02:49:05,520 --> 02:49:07,520
My booby itches.

1778
02:49:07,520 --> 02:49:09,520
It's the booby.

1779
02:49:13,520 --> 02:49:15,520
Booby has been itched.

1780
02:49:15,520 --> 02:49:17,520
We commend.

1781
02:49:17,520 --> 02:49:19,520
Yeah.

1782
02:49:21,520 --> 02:49:23,520
Yeah, don't get distracted.

1783
02:49:23,520 --> 02:49:25,520
Just have me on the background. You're not missing much.

1784
02:49:25,520 --> 02:49:27,520
I'm just falling off cliffs.

1785
02:49:29,520 --> 02:49:31,520
Like so.

1786
02:49:31,520 --> 02:49:33,520
Does it want me to go...

1787
02:49:33,520 --> 02:49:35,520
Around this way?

1788
02:49:37,520 --> 02:49:39,520
Okay, well...

1789
02:49:41,520 --> 02:49:43,520
What is this?

1790
02:49:43,520 --> 02:49:45,520
Bail!

1791
02:49:47,520 --> 02:49:49,520
Bail!

1792
02:49:51,520 --> 02:49:53,520
You think what's his face was here?

1793
02:49:53,520 --> 02:49:55,520
Look at the E.P. Dragon.

1794
02:49:57,520 --> 02:49:59,520
Wait, why does Torrance's nose look purple?

1795
02:49:59,520 --> 02:50:01,520
I was weird. It looked like...

1796
02:50:01,520 --> 02:50:03,520
Wait, what the fuck? What's up with Torrance's eye?

1797
02:50:03,520 --> 02:50:05,520
Torrance has like a very human eye.

1798
02:50:05,520 --> 02:50:07,520
It didn't look like it was like the normal

1799
02:50:07,520 --> 02:50:09,520
horse eye.

1800
02:50:09,520 --> 02:50:11,520
I can't jump down from there.

1801
02:50:11,520 --> 02:50:13,520
What's the point of this?

1802
02:50:13,520 --> 02:50:15,520
Dumb.

1803
02:50:23,520 --> 02:50:25,520
Bail!

1804
02:50:25,520 --> 02:50:27,520
Oh, Terror Incarnate!

1805
02:50:27,520 --> 02:50:29,520
Bail!

1806
02:50:29,520 --> 02:50:31,520
Well...

1807
02:50:31,520 --> 02:50:33,520
Something doesn't seem right here.

1808
02:50:37,520 --> 02:50:39,520
Okay, then I just keep...

1809
02:50:39,520 --> 02:50:41,520
Just going this way.

1810
02:50:41,520 --> 02:50:43,520
I need to scratch my boob.

1811
02:50:43,520 --> 02:50:45,520
Why is my boob itchy?

1812
02:50:45,520 --> 02:50:47,520
I'm scared that Bail's going to jump from the sky.

1813
02:50:47,520 --> 02:50:49,520
And get me.

1814
02:50:49,520 --> 02:50:51,520
I don't know where he is.

1815
02:50:51,520 --> 02:50:53,520
Not...

1816
02:50:53,520 --> 02:50:55,520
I haven't explored.

1817
02:50:55,520 --> 02:50:57,520
I've only looked at lore in some boss fights.

1818
02:50:57,520 --> 02:50:59,520
I haven't

1819
02:50:59,520 --> 02:51:01,520
done like actual map exploration

1820
02:51:01,520 --> 02:51:03,520
videos.

1821
02:51:03,520 --> 02:51:05,520
Why is that sheep so fucking huge?

1822
02:51:09,520 --> 02:51:11,520
Some of these are super sheep.

1823
02:51:13,520 --> 02:51:15,520
Yeah, surprise!

1824
02:51:19,520 --> 02:51:21,520
Did I go the right way?

1825
02:51:21,520 --> 02:51:23,520
I did. Okay, this isn't that bad.

1826
02:51:23,520 --> 02:51:25,520
And then we come to

1827
02:51:25,520 --> 02:51:27,520
a Dragon Communion church, I believe.

1828
02:51:33,520 --> 02:51:35,520
Yes, yes.

1829
02:51:35,520 --> 02:51:37,520
Quite. That is terrifying.

1830
02:51:43,520 --> 02:51:45,520
Indeed, yes.

1831
02:51:47,520 --> 02:51:49,520
Is that the stake American? Why is that...

1832
02:51:49,520 --> 02:51:51,520
Oh.

1833
02:51:51,520 --> 02:51:53,520
No.

1834
02:51:53,520 --> 02:51:55,520
Hey!

1835
02:52:07,520 --> 02:52:09,520
I like your fit.

1836
02:52:15,520 --> 02:52:17,520
You're a dragon person.

1837
02:52:19,520 --> 02:52:21,520
Are you, like, a land sacks

1838
02:52:21,520 --> 02:52:23,520
who became a human?

1839
02:52:23,520 --> 02:52:25,520
I will not partake.

1840
02:52:29,520 --> 02:52:31,520
Yeah, I don't want to be a dragon.

1841
02:52:33,520 --> 02:52:35,520
Thank you.

1842
02:52:35,520 --> 02:52:37,520
I appreciate that.

1843
02:52:37,520 --> 02:52:39,520
Thank you for the offer. That was very, very kind.

1844
02:52:39,520 --> 02:52:41,520
Very kind.

1845
02:52:43,520 --> 02:52:45,520
You know, you know what's funny?

1846
02:52:45,520 --> 02:52:47,520
Placidus sacks

1847
02:52:47,520 --> 02:52:49,520
is not as big as this dragon.

1848
02:52:49,520 --> 02:52:51,520
This dragon is fucking huge.

1849
02:52:53,520 --> 02:52:55,520
The dragon that fell...

1850
02:52:55,520 --> 02:52:57,520
Oh, I can't do anything.

1851
02:52:57,520 --> 02:52:59,520
The dragon that fell

1852
02:52:59,520 --> 02:53:01,520
on Lindell. I forget what its name is.

1853
02:53:01,520 --> 02:53:03,520
Whatever the fuck.

1854
02:53:05,520 --> 02:53:07,520
Yes, yes, yes, priestess.

1855
02:53:09,520 --> 02:53:11,520
Can I climb into your mouth?

1856
02:53:11,520 --> 02:53:13,520
I feel like I should be able to.

1857
02:53:13,520 --> 02:53:15,520
They are not as big as these dragons.

1858
02:53:15,520 --> 02:53:17,520
Like, I don't like them.

1859
02:53:17,520 --> 02:53:19,520
Like, who killed this guy?

1860
02:53:19,520 --> 02:53:21,520
I don't know. I don't know the lore of this.

1861
02:53:21,520 --> 02:53:23,520
I haven't looked it up yet, but I will.

1862
02:53:23,520 --> 02:53:25,520
I feel like he should have more teeth.

1863
02:53:25,520 --> 02:53:27,520
I feel like there should be a second row of teeth.

1864
02:53:27,520 --> 02:53:29,520
This is very cool, though.

1865
02:53:29,520 --> 02:53:31,520
Like a funky chin moment

1866
02:53:31,520 --> 02:53:33,520
mouth thing.

1867
02:53:33,520 --> 02:53:35,520
I don't know.

1868
02:53:39,520 --> 02:53:41,520
Yeah, but he has a lot of heads.

1869
02:53:41,520 --> 02:53:43,520
That doesn't matter.

1870
02:53:43,520 --> 02:53:45,520
That's fucking humongous.

1871
02:53:45,520 --> 02:53:47,520
And so is Greyl,

1872
02:53:47,520 --> 02:53:49,520
but she's old.

1873
02:53:53,520 --> 02:53:55,520
Rena is purring, and she's leaning

1874
02:53:55,520 --> 02:53:57,520
against my headphone wire, and it's like

1875
02:53:57,520 --> 02:53:59,520
I can hear her purrs in my ear.

1876
02:54:01,520 --> 02:54:03,520
That's so weird.

1877
02:54:07,520 --> 02:54:09,520
What are you doing, Rudy?

1878
02:54:10,520 --> 02:54:12,520
It's vibrating up my headphone wire.

1879
02:54:14,520 --> 02:54:16,520
I'm not saying size doesn't mean power.

1880
02:54:16,520 --> 02:54:18,520
I'm just wondering,

1881
02:54:18,520 --> 02:54:21,520
I know Godwin killed

1882
02:54:21,520 --> 02:54:23,520
the one that was over Lindell,

1883
02:54:23,520 --> 02:54:25,520
and it was a brutal bloody fight.

1884
02:54:26,520 --> 02:54:28,520
But like,

1885
02:54:28,520 --> 02:54:30,520
I'm, this is, yeah, this is

1886
02:54:30,520 --> 02:54:32,520
this is a big ass fucking dragon, dude.

1887
02:54:34,520 --> 02:54:36,520
Where are my fucking Caleb? Why is everything so red?

1888
02:54:37,520 --> 02:54:39,520
Rena, your purrs are throwing me off,

1889
02:54:39,520 --> 02:54:41,520
because it sounds like it's in-game.

1890
02:54:48,520 --> 02:54:50,520
I wish you guys could hear this.

1891
02:54:50,520 --> 02:54:52,520
It's such an interesting, it's almost like it's on a 3DO.

1892
02:54:54,520 --> 02:54:56,520
Okay.

1893
02:54:56,520 --> 02:54:58,520
Yippee!

1894
02:54:58,520 --> 02:55:00,520
He said, once you're at the red flowers,

1895
02:55:00,520 --> 02:55:02,520
you're in the right direction.

1896
02:55:02,520 --> 02:55:04,520
These are cool.

1897
02:55:04,520 --> 02:55:06,520
They look like chameleons.

1898
02:55:06,520 --> 02:55:09,520
Chameleons? Chamelea flowers?

1899
02:55:09,520 --> 02:55:11,520
Camillo flowers.

1900
02:55:12,520 --> 02:55:14,520
Cami-cami-ha flowers.

1901
02:55:18,520 --> 02:55:20,520
Turtles! Look at

1902
02:55:20,520 --> 02:55:22,520
dogs!

1903
02:55:22,520 --> 02:55:24,520
Wait, what's that?

1904
02:55:28,520 --> 02:55:30,520
Is there a lobster going to

1905
02:55:30,520 --> 02:55:32,520
show up and fuck me up?

1906
02:55:32,520 --> 02:55:34,520
Nope, just a tibia mariner.

1907
02:55:35,520 --> 02:55:37,520
I'm living its best life.

1908
02:55:40,520 --> 02:55:42,520
Oh, I fell.

1909
02:55:58,520 --> 02:56:00,520
Sorry, Rena, I have to move

1910
02:56:00,520 --> 02:56:02,520
the headphone wire.

1911
02:56:04,520 --> 02:56:06,520
Your purrs are nice to listen to.

1912
02:56:06,520 --> 02:56:08,520
It's such a scale, though.

1913
02:56:14,520 --> 02:56:16,520
Alrighty.

1914
02:56:16,520 --> 02:56:18,520
Do I have, like, everything?

1915
02:56:20,520 --> 02:56:22,520
What am I doing?

1916
02:56:25,520 --> 02:56:27,520
Okay.

1917
02:56:30,520 --> 02:56:32,520
So many pools now.

1918
02:56:32,520 --> 02:56:34,520
Functional.

1919
02:56:35,520 --> 02:56:37,520
I think I have to keep going this way.

1920
02:56:43,520 --> 02:56:45,520
Let me look at the

1921
02:56:45,520 --> 02:56:47,520
thingy.

1922
02:56:48,520 --> 02:56:50,520
What do you mean this area?

1923
02:56:56,520 --> 02:56:58,520
Yup.

1924
02:57:01,520 --> 02:57:03,520
Yup.

1925
02:57:08,520 --> 02:57:10,520
Yup.

1926
02:57:13,520 --> 02:57:15,520
Yup.

1927
02:57:30,520 --> 02:57:32,520
Yup.

1928
02:58:01,520 --> 02:58:03,520
Oh.

1929
02:58:04,520 --> 02:58:06,520
I'm going to fight a hippo.

1930
02:58:07,520 --> 02:58:09,520
Guys, I'm going to fight a hippo.

1931
02:58:09,520 --> 02:58:11,520
What the fuck? Did you see that bird

1932
02:58:11,520 --> 02:58:13,520
just, like, move?

1933
02:58:13,520 --> 02:58:15,520
I was like this, and then, like,

1934
02:58:15,520 --> 02:58:17,520
wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on.

1935
02:58:17,520 --> 02:58:19,520
Do you see it jump when I

1936
02:58:19,520 --> 02:58:21,520
It, like, loads in.

1937
02:58:22,520 --> 02:58:24,520
Why does it do that?

1938
02:58:25,520 --> 02:58:27,520
That's such a weird thing.

1939
02:58:31,520 --> 02:58:33,520
What the fuck?

1940
02:58:36,520 --> 02:58:38,520
Alright, bro.

1941
02:58:43,520 --> 02:58:45,520
Time to find a hippo.

1942
02:58:56,520 --> 02:58:58,520
That boss music is terrifying.

1943
02:59:00,520 --> 02:59:02,520
Ah.

1944
02:59:03,520 --> 02:59:05,520
What's that?

1945
02:59:05,520 --> 02:59:07,520
Ghost flame bloom.

1946
02:59:07,520 --> 02:59:09,520
Ooh, what's this?

1947
02:59:10,520 --> 02:59:12,520
No.

1948
02:59:12,520 --> 02:59:14,520
It's hippo time.

1949
02:59:18,520 --> 02:59:20,520
Um.

1950
02:59:20,520 --> 02:59:22,520
Hi.

1951
02:59:22,520 --> 02:59:24,520
Hi, hippo.

1952
02:59:24,520 --> 02:59:26,520
What? No, hippo.

1953
02:59:27,520 --> 02:59:29,520
Oh, you're kind of slow.

1954
02:59:30,520 --> 02:59:32,520
Ow. No, you're not.

1955
02:59:32,520 --> 02:59:34,520
Wow, I did

1956
02:59:34,520 --> 02:59:36,520
kind of barely any damage to you.

1957
02:59:44,520 --> 02:59:46,520
Okay.

1958
02:59:46,520 --> 02:59:48,520
Alright.

1959
02:59:48,520 --> 02:59:50,520
At least your damage isn't too hard.

1960
02:59:51,520 --> 02:59:53,520
What's that?

1961
02:59:53,520 --> 02:59:55,520
I didn't get to see it.

1962
02:59:56,520 --> 02:59:59,520
Oh, you just

1963
02:59:59,520 --> 03:00:01,520
destroyed my pose.

1964
03:00:01,520 --> 03:00:03,520
Boys.

1965
03:00:07,520 --> 03:00:09,520
Oh, I thought I was scratching my chin

1966
03:00:09,520 --> 03:00:11,520
and then I didn't press the B button in time.

1967
03:00:15,520 --> 03:00:17,520
Can you give me a second?

1968
03:00:17,520 --> 03:00:19,520
Hold on.

1969
03:00:25,520 --> 03:00:27,520
I'm a little

1970
03:00:27,520 --> 03:00:29,520
fascinated by you.

1971
03:00:29,520 --> 03:00:31,520
Because you're like

1972
03:00:31,520 --> 03:00:33,520
very slow.

1973
03:00:33,520 --> 03:00:35,520
You pack a wallet.

1974
03:00:35,520 --> 03:00:37,520
It's good to stay like on you

1975
03:00:37,520 --> 03:00:39,520
and then roll

1976
03:00:39,520 --> 03:00:41,520
on the inside.

1977
03:00:48,520 --> 03:00:50,520
I'm not

1978
03:00:50,520 --> 03:00:52,520
rolling as much as I want to.

1979
03:00:56,520 --> 03:00:58,520
Oh, okay.

1980
03:01:05,520 --> 03:01:07,520
I didn't mean to do the third one.

1981
03:01:07,520 --> 03:01:09,520
I

1982
03:01:09,520 --> 03:01:11,520
rolled forward, but it didn't

1983
03:01:11,520 --> 03:01:13,520
have too slow.

1984
03:01:13,520 --> 03:01:15,520
Alright.

1985
03:01:17,520 --> 03:01:19,520
Oh, you did that twice.

1986
03:01:21,520 --> 03:01:23,520
I didn't really dodge that well.

1987
03:01:25,520 --> 03:01:27,520
Okay.

1988
03:01:31,520 --> 03:01:33,520
What did I do to knock you

1989
03:01:33,520 --> 03:01:35,520
just that much health?

1990
03:01:35,520 --> 03:01:37,520
I simply don't recall.

1991
03:01:39,520 --> 03:01:41,520
I think

1992
03:01:41,520 --> 03:01:43,520
I thought I had the timing right,

1993
03:01:43,520 --> 03:01:45,520
but I guess I don't.

1994
03:01:45,520 --> 03:01:47,520
I guess it was the bleed.

1995
03:01:49,520 --> 03:01:51,520
I only have one flash left.

1996
03:01:52,520 --> 03:01:54,520
Yeah, I just fucked it up, though.

1997
03:01:54,520 --> 03:01:56,520
No.

1998
03:02:05,520 --> 03:02:07,520
I'm not really doing that good.

1999
03:02:21,520 --> 03:02:23,520
You're a weird hippo.

2000
03:02:23,520 --> 03:02:25,520
Oh,

2001
03:02:25,520 --> 03:02:27,520
I pressed it at the same time you bit me.

2002
03:02:31,520 --> 03:02:33,520
Yes.

2003
03:02:33,520 --> 03:02:35,520
I know.

2004
03:02:35,520 --> 03:02:37,520
I know it's like there's another dude that

2005
03:02:37,520 --> 03:02:39,520
rides a hippo.

2006
03:02:39,520 --> 03:02:41,520
It's a good hippo practice.

2007
03:02:41,520 --> 03:02:43,520
It's a good hippo practice.

2008
03:02:49,520 --> 03:02:51,520
I don't feel like hunting for

2009
03:02:51,520 --> 03:02:53,520
golden seeds, to be honest with you.

2010
03:02:53,520 --> 03:02:55,520
Oh.

2011
03:03:07,520 --> 03:03:09,520
Those will just take too much time.

2012
03:03:13,520 --> 03:03:15,520
Okay, now I know how to fight the hippo.

2013
03:03:15,520 --> 03:03:17,520
I know how to fight the hippo.

2014
03:03:23,520 --> 03:03:25,520
Help.

2015
03:03:27,520 --> 03:03:29,520
I'm gonna sneak up on him.

2016
03:03:31,520 --> 03:03:33,520
I'm gonna sneak up on the hippo.

2017
03:03:45,520 --> 03:03:47,520
He hasn't seen us yet.

2018
03:03:47,520 --> 03:03:49,520
He hasn't seen us yet.

2019
03:03:51,520 --> 03:03:53,520
Here we see the Elton Ring hippo

2020
03:03:53,520 --> 03:03:55,520
in its natural habitat.

2021
03:03:57,520 --> 03:03:59,520
Roaming.

2022
03:04:05,520 --> 03:04:07,520
Okay, well...

2023
03:04:15,520 --> 03:04:17,520
Oh, I forgot you do it twice.

2024
03:04:21,520 --> 03:04:23,520
I jumped over that!

2025
03:04:23,520 --> 03:04:25,520
I jumped over that.

2026
03:04:29,520 --> 03:04:31,520
I jumped over that.

2027
03:04:33,520 --> 03:04:35,520
You whip around way too fast.

2028
03:04:35,520 --> 03:04:37,520
I don't feel like you should be able to whip around that fast.

2029
03:04:41,520 --> 03:04:43,520
Ow.

2030
03:04:45,520 --> 03:04:47,520
I did better the first time.

2031
03:04:47,520 --> 03:04:49,520
Why are you so powerful?

2032
03:04:49,520 --> 03:04:51,520
Stop it.

2033
03:04:53,520 --> 03:04:55,520
I jumped right into your jaws.

2034
03:04:55,520 --> 03:04:57,520
I deserve to die.

2035
03:05:03,520 --> 03:05:05,520
I don't know why the camera was like that.

2036
03:05:07,520 --> 03:05:09,520
I thought it killed itself for a second.

2037
03:05:09,520 --> 03:05:11,520
No, please.

2038
03:05:11,520 --> 03:05:13,520
Can I please heal?

2039
03:05:15,520 --> 03:05:17,520
Yeah, let's do a little.

2040
03:05:21,520 --> 03:05:23,520
Hi.

2041
03:05:25,520 --> 03:05:27,520
I...

2042
03:05:27,520 --> 03:05:29,520
No, I don't time that right.

2043
03:05:29,520 --> 03:05:31,520
I just really should just roll past your jaws.

2044
03:05:33,520 --> 03:05:35,520
Oh, my fucking god.

2045
03:05:37,520 --> 03:05:39,520
I am not doing the timing right at all.

2046
03:05:41,520 --> 03:05:43,520
You got ugly fucking mouth.

2047
03:05:45,520 --> 03:05:47,520
Oh, my god.

2048
03:06:01,520 --> 03:06:03,520
I...

2049
03:06:03,520 --> 03:06:05,520
I'm locked in stunned animations.

2050
03:06:05,520 --> 03:06:07,520
I...

2051
03:06:07,520 --> 03:06:09,520
I feel like...

2052
03:06:09,520 --> 03:06:11,520
I don't know why I suddenly don't have the timing right.

2053
03:06:13,520 --> 03:06:15,520
Okay.

2054
03:06:15,520 --> 03:06:17,520
Hmm.

2055
03:06:17,520 --> 03:06:19,520
Hmm.

2056
03:06:19,520 --> 03:06:21,520
Hmm.

2057
03:06:21,520 --> 03:06:23,520
Hmm.

2058
03:06:23,520 --> 03:06:25,520
Hmm.

2059
03:06:25,520 --> 03:06:27,520
Hmm.

2060
03:06:27,520 --> 03:06:29,520
Hmm.

2061
03:06:29,520 --> 03:06:31,520
Hmm.

2062
03:06:31,520 --> 03:06:33,520
Hmm.

2063
03:06:33,520 --> 03:06:35,520
Hmm.

2064
03:06:35,520 --> 03:06:37,520
Hmm.

2065
03:06:37,520 --> 03:06:39,520
Hmm.

2066
03:06:39,520 --> 03:06:41,520
Hmm.

2067
03:06:41,520 --> 03:06:43,520
I wonder what the healing fast tastes like.

2068
03:06:43,520 --> 03:06:45,520
Strawberry blood.

2069
03:06:45,520 --> 03:06:47,520
Sun kiss.

2070
03:06:47,520 --> 03:06:49,520
Sun kiss.

2071
03:06:49,520 --> 03:06:51,520
I feel like it would taste like Coca-Cola.

2072
03:06:51,520 --> 03:06:53,520
I feel like it would taste like Coca-Cola.

2073
03:06:53,520 --> 03:06:55,520
Or Dr. Pepper.

2074
03:06:55,520 --> 03:06:57,520
I'm going to say Dr. Pepper flavored glass.

2075
03:06:57,520 --> 03:06:59,520
Or a Shirley Temple.

2076
03:06:59,520 --> 03:07:01,520
Or like a lime ricky.

2077
03:07:01,520 --> 03:07:03,520
I don't know if people know what that is.

2078
03:07:05,520 --> 03:07:07,520
It's essentially like a Shirley Temple.

2079
03:07:09,520 --> 03:07:11,520
I don't know if people know what a Shirley Temple is.

2080
03:07:11,520 --> 03:07:13,520
Oh.

2081
03:07:13,520 --> 03:07:15,520
Okay.

2082
03:07:17,520 --> 03:07:19,520
We're going to do this the right way.

2083
03:07:19,520 --> 03:07:21,520
I don't...

2084
03:07:21,520 --> 03:07:23,520
I'm pretty sure I can...

2085
03:07:23,520 --> 03:07:25,520
If I do it with Torrent, I...

2086
03:07:25,520 --> 03:07:27,520
I feel like...

2087
03:07:27,520 --> 03:07:29,520
I feel like...

2088
03:07:29,520 --> 03:07:31,520
I feel like...

2089
03:07:31,520 --> 03:07:33,520
I'm just going to keep missing all my hits.

2090
03:07:47,520 --> 03:07:49,520
Like, I swear I roll and I jump and I miss that.

2091
03:07:49,520 --> 03:07:51,520
I...

2092
03:07:51,520 --> 03:07:53,520
For whatever reason.

2093
03:07:53,520 --> 03:07:55,520
I...

2094
03:07:57,520 --> 03:07:59,520
I rolled past it.

2095
03:07:59,520 --> 03:08:01,520
I rolled past that.

2096
03:08:01,520 --> 03:08:03,520
I...

2097
03:08:03,520 --> 03:08:05,520
My hitbox.

2098
03:08:05,520 --> 03:08:07,520
I...

2099
03:08:11,520 --> 03:08:13,520
Come over here.

2100
03:08:13,520 --> 03:08:15,520
I don't want to be near that thing.

2101
03:08:23,520 --> 03:08:25,520
I...

2102
03:08:33,520 --> 03:08:35,520
Maybe I will have to do it on Torrent.

2103
03:08:35,520 --> 03:08:37,520
What the fuck?

2104
03:08:41,520 --> 03:08:43,520
Should I not lock on?

2105
03:08:49,520 --> 03:08:51,520
I'm doing better when I can't

2106
03:08:51,520 --> 03:08:53,520
fucking see him for some reason.

2107
03:09:01,520 --> 03:09:03,520
I didn't roll in time.

2108
03:09:03,520 --> 03:09:05,520
My nuke is getting fucking stomped.

2109
03:09:05,520 --> 03:09:07,520
I hate his mustache.

2110
03:09:09,520 --> 03:09:11,520
I regret that he does it twice.

2111
03:09:21,520 --> 03:09:23,520
I rolled.

2112
03:09:25,520 --> 03:09:27,520
Oh, he does it twice.

2113
03:09:27,520 --> 03:09:29,520
I forgot.

2114
03:09:29,520 --> 03:09:31,520
I keep saying he does it twice.

2115
03:09:51,520 --> 03:09:53,520
Whoa.

2116
03:09:53,520 --> 03:09:55,520
Why isn't the camera moving?

2117
03:09:55,520 --> 03:09:57,520
I was trying to move the camera back

2118
03:09:57,520 --> 03:09:59,520
and it wasn't moving.

2119
03:09:59,520 --> 03:10:01,520
I...

2120
03:10:01,520 --> 03:10:03,520
I...

2121
03:10:03,520 --> 03:10:05,520
I...

2122
03:10:05,520 --> 03:10:07,520
I...

2123
03:10:07,520 --> 03:10:09,520
I...

2124
03:10:09,520 --> 03:10:11,520
I...

2125
03:10:11,520 --> 03:10:13,520
I...

2126
03:10:13,520 --> 03:10:15,520
I...

2127
03:10:15,520 --> 03:10:17,520
I was trying to move the camera back

2128
03:10:17,520 --> 03:10:19,520
and it wasn't moving.

2129
03:10:21,520 --> 03:10:23,520
Oh my god.

2130
03:10:23,520 --> 03:10:25,520
Don't fuck it up.

2131
03:10:25,520 --> 03:10:27,520
Okay, I was gonna say, like Jesus Christ.

2132
03:10:27,520 --> 03:10:29,520
Alright.

2133
03:10:29,520 --> 03:10:31,520
Nifty.

2134
03:10:33,520 --> 03:10:35,520
I don't think that really matters.

2135
03:10:35,520 --> 03:10:37,520
I'm just gonna go teleport.

2136
03:10:39,520 --> 03:10:41,520
I'm honorable.

2137
03:10:41,520 --> 03:10:43,520
I have to respect the beast.

2138
03:10:43,520 --> 03:10:45,520
I can't sully it with magic.

2139
03:10:45,520 --> 03:10:47,520
I was kidding.

2140
03:10:47,520 --> 03:10:49,520
Alright.

2141
03:10:49,520 --> 03:10:51,520
I think it locked into one of those

2142
03:10:51,520 --> 03:10:53,520
and that's why it got fucked up.

2143
03:10:53,520 --> 03:10:55,520
Let me just grab this so it doesn't pop up on my radar thingy.

2144
03:11:01,520 --> 03:11:03,520
Alright, what's next?

2145
03:11:19,520 --> 03:11:21,520
Wait.

2146
03:11:31,520 --> 03:11:33,520
Wait, the NPC...

2147
03:11:33,520 --> 03:11:35,520
When I step into the shadow, keep the NPCs going

2148
03:11:35,520 --> 03:11:37,520
to a second fucking phase.

2149
03:11:37,520 --> 03:11:39,520
That is such a weird thing.

2150
03:11:43,520 --> 03:11:45,520
Huh?

2151
03:11:45,520 --> 03:11:47,520
Explain.

2152
03:11:47,520 --> 03:11:49,520
I have confusion.

2153
03:11:49,520 --> 03:11:51,520
Something really important happens.

2154
03:11:55,520 --> 03:11:57,520
I thought...

2155
03:11:57,520 --> 03:11:59,520
That sucks.

2156
03:12:01,520 --> 03:12:03,520
It kind of sucks

2157
03:12:03,520 --> 03:12:05,520
because if you're just playing around willy-nilly

2158
03:12:05,520 --> 03:12:07,520
you get soft luck out of a lot of shit.

2159
03:12:11,520 --> 03:12:13,520
Um...

2160
03:12:13,520 --> 03:12:15,520
Alright.

2161
03:12:17,520 --> 03:12:19,520
Damn.

2162
03:12:25,520 --> 03:12:27,520
Uh, whose side quest should we do?

2163
03:12:27,520 --> 03:12:29,520
Should I go try to kill Lorelauna?

2164
03:12:29,520 --> 03:12:31,520
Raina's licking my arm.

2165
03:12:41,520 --> 03:12:43,520
Let's try Lorelauna.

2166
03:12:47,520 --> 03:12:49,520
Alright.

2167
03:12:51,520 --> 03:12:53,520
So like if I didn't talk to certain people

2168
03:12:55,520 --> 03:12:57,520
then...

2169
03:12:57,520 --> 03:12:59,520
What the fuck am I doing?

2170
03:13:01,520 --> 03:13:03,520
If I don't talk to certain people

2171
03:13:05,520 --> 03:13:07,520
I get locked out of their quest.

2172
03:13:07,520 --> 03:13:09,520
Did I talk to everyone?

2173
03:13:11,520 --> 03:13:13,520
Hi, Raina.

2174
03:13:17,520 --> 03:13:19,520
Not the sweet boy though, yeah.

2175
03:13:27,520 --> 03:13:29,520
Let's try it.

2176
03:13:35,520 --> 03:13:37,520
Okay.

2177
03:13:41,520 --> 03:13:43,520
She is crazy poise though.

2178
03:13:43,520 --> 03:13:45,520
I feel like I should dual wheel...

2179
03:13:45,520 --> 03:13:47,520
Oh, I can't dual wheel.

2180
03:13:55,520 --> 03:13:57,520
I'll just waste the flash.

2181
03:13:59,520 --> 03:14:01,520
Oh, she just fucks me up.

2182
03:14:03,520 --> 03:14:05,520
She does take a little breaks though

2183
03:14:05,520 --> 03:14:07,520
after her fucking little massive swings.

2184
03:14:13,520 --> 03:14:15,520
Like a lot of lore dialogue?

2185
03:14:15,520 --> 03:14:17,520
I see, I see.

2186
03:14:21,520 --> 03:14:23,520
Aw, let me fix the chat again.

2187
03:14:25,520 --> 03:14:27,520
I wish chat would work.

2188
03:14:27,520 --> 03:14:29,520
That would be great.

2189
03:14:29,520 --> 03:14:31,520
I need to find another website.

2190
03:14:31,520 --> 03:14:33,520
Hi, Raina.

2191
03:14:35,520 --> 03:14:37,520
Okay, time to try to fight Rinala

2192
03:14:37,520 --> 03:14:39,520
for three hours.

2193
03:14:39,520 --> 03:14:41,520
Relana, whatever the fuck her name is.

2194
03:14:41,520 --> 03:14:43,520
I feel like I wanna almost take off all my fucken...

2195
03:14:47,520 --> 03:14:49,520
Hold on, okay.

2196
03:14:49,520 --> 03:14:51,520
Hold on, I have cat hair in my nose.

2197
03:14:51,520 --> 03:14:53,520
I need to see if I can find Rinala or not?

2198
03:15:05,520 --> 03:15:07,520
Please!

2199
03:15:07,520 --> 03:15:17,200
Hold on. Hold on. I have cat hair in my nose. Hold on. I have cat hair. Stop. I have cat hair. Time out!

2200
03:15:18,320 --> 03:15:20,320
Time out!

2201
03:15:28,560 --> 03:15:34,240
I think we all did use the same chat thing at um, I won't point, but I don't think they used it anymore.

2202
03:15:37,520 --> 03:15:39,520
I

2203
03:15:43,520 --> 03:15:53,920
Didn't summon Freya for the dancing lion was I supposed to I just killed him with my thingy

2204
03:16:00,720 --> 03:16:06,640
Cat hair my weakness. I'm just hoping Raina doesn't chew on my thing. What is she weak to oh, I can

2205
03:16:07,520 --> 03:16:15,840
Do I have to do something for her?

2206
03:16:20,560 --> 03:16:22,560
I'm hanging out

2207
03:16:26,800 --> 03:16:28,800
Hi

2208
03:16:28,960 --> 03:16:30,960
Oh

2209
03:16:36,320 --> 03:16:38,640
Let's go leader we got this

2210
03:16:48,720 --> 03:16:50,720
Go on leader get them

2211
03:16:54,880 --> 03:16:56,880
We're sizing each other up

2212
03:16:57,360 --> 03:17:00,160
Oh my god, holy shit

2213
03:17:04,720 --> 03:17:07,360
Her poise is I'm gonna die

2214
03:17:11,840 --> 03:17:16,960
No, that's not what I meant to grab damn leaders do put it in fucking work. I'm not gonna lie

2215
03:17:19,520 --> 03:17:21,520
Can we get some blood proc?

2216
03:17:21,520 --> 03:17:29,840
Yeah, that's pretty nice. She's weak to lightning

2217
03:17:42,240 --> 03:17:44,240
Oh, was that uh, was that uh

2218
03:17:45,440 --> 03:17:47,440
Oh, yeah, because she's standing on fucking water

2219
03:17:48,560 --> 03:17:50,560
But I don't have any incantations for that shit

2220
03:17:52,080 --> 03:17:56,240
I wish there was lightning sorcery like why isn't there such thing as lightning sorcery?

2221
03:17:58,720 --> 03:18:00,720
Oh nice skadoosh

2222
03:18:10,960 --> 03:18:12,960
If they hate sorcery, why would they do this?

2223
03:18:21,680 --> 03:18:23,680
What is that?

2224
03:18:25,440 --> 03:18:32,640
All these incantations I don't have access to because I don't use faith. What is this actual spirit? That's kind of terrifying

2225
03:18:36,560 --> 03:18:38,560
Of human build

2226
03:18:40,560 --> 03:18:42,560
Golden vow would be pretty nice

2227
03:18:44,320 --> 03:18:46,880
You'll feel from afar good for summons

2228
03:18:51,600 --> 03:18:53,600
Do I have

2229
03:18:55,600 --> 03:18:58,640
This is where I actually get to the nitty gritty

2230
03:19:01,200 --> 03:19:03,200
I don't have any lightning pots

2231
03:19:05,120 --> 03:19:07,120
Because then I would throw lightning pots at her

2232
03:19:10,080 --> 03:19:12,880
I don't have the cookbook for that. I believe that is in

2233
03:19:18,000 --> 03:19:20,000
I believe

2234
03:19:20,960 --> 03:19:22,960
I would sleep her if I have the

2235
03:19:27,840 --> 03:19:29,840
She's not weak she has flame

2236
03:19:32,240 --> 03:19:34,240
Oh

2237
03:19:42,320 --> 03:19:47,600
Yeah, I don't I don't have any lightning resin or uh, I mean lightning grease. Yeah, I provided the same fucking thing

2238
03:19:48,320 --> 03:19:50,320
Cause it's kind of heavy

2239
03:19:53,200 --> 03:19:55,200
It's so weird that lightning is tied to faith

2240
03:20:01,520 --> 03:20:03,520
Yeah, that's true I could

2241
03:20:08,320 --> 03:20:10,320
Um

2242
03:20:11,040 --> 03:20:13,040
I don't have any cracked ponds

2243
03:20:13,600 --> 03:20:17,840
I never got any cracked pots

2244
03:20:24,400 --> 03:20:26,400
Little just brute-forcer

2245
03:20:27,680 --> 03:20:32,480
Yeah, but I only have one eat. I only have one Trina Lily. I have one pot

2246
03:20:34,400 --> 03:20:35,920
Um

2247
03:20:35,920 --> 03:20:41,520
I don't want to use pots because like I just know I'll just fucking waste them all trying to craft them

2248
03:20:43,440 --> 03:20:45,440
Hey

2249
03:20:47,760 --> 03:20:49,760
I can't jump that time

2250
03:20:51,680 --> 03:20:53,680
You have crazy reach

2251
03:20:57,200 --> 03:21:00,000
She literally fucking dances like millennia

2252
03:21:01,520 --> 03:21:05,920
Oh, sorry, I should have jumped over that. What the fuck? Where's army?

2253
03:21:13,840 --> 03:21:20,080
She always follows up a true carrion princess. Yeah, this is do fucking shit to her

2254
03:21:24,320 --> 03:21:26,320
Hmm

2255
03:21:28,800 --> 03:21:30,960
I might have to get a lightning weapon boys

2256
03:21:33,520 --> 03:21:38,080
I could try a blood build up with my ash

2257
03:21:44,000 --> 03:21:46,000
You

2258
03:21:48,960 --> 03:21:53,840
No, I I I prefer to solo uh her or try or with a summon

2259
03:21:53,840 --> 03:21:58,960
I I try to do everything by myself unless I'm really struggling like with those um

2260
03:22:00,160 --> 03:22:03,280
Fucking virgin abductors. I was just annoying

2261
03:22:06,640 --> 03:22:11,840
Um, you know, it's let's get lead in here and then I'll have two ladies

2262
03:22:13,280 --> 03:22:18,240
Can I do both? I don't know why does it take forever for her to fucking load in that doesn't make any sense

2263
03:22:22,480 --> 03:22:24,480
You're pretty neat neat looking

2264
03:22:43,680 --> 03:22:45,680
I

2265
03:22:47,280 --> 03:22:50,880
Why this is insane I can't even hit her

2266
03:22:53,680 --> 03:22:55,680
She have a second phase

2267
03:23:01,920 --> 03:23:04,800
We are not doing any fucking damage it's really just blood

2268
03:23:08,400 --> 03:23:10,400
Holy shit, don't die

2269
03:23:13,840 --> 03:23:15,840
You

2270
03:23:21,360 --> 03:23:23,360
Can I repost her can I repost her no

2271
03:23:31,520 --> 03:23:37,120
I should just I wish I just had to heal because then I would just heal her. What is this? This is just a gang bang. I feel bad

2272
03:23:43,440 --> 03:23:45,440
I

2273
03:23:50,960 --> 03:23:57,280
My game just lags so hard. Oh, why did I heal? I didn't need to I was looking at her health bar

2274
03:24:05,200 --> 03:24:10,720
Can I repost her? I don't know gang up on her ass gang up on her ass

2275
03:24:13,840 --> 03:24:15,840

Don't die

2277
03:24:27,920 --> 03:24:29,920
No, don't die

2278
03:24:29,920 --> 03:24:31,920
Ha ha ha

2279
03:24:42,320 --> 03:24:45,280
Okay, NPCs increase the boss difficulty, yeah

2280
03:24:45,280 --> 03:24:47,280

I

2286
03:25:41,520 --> 03:25:43,520
Just want to do blood build up any of this

2287
03:25:58,160 --> 03:26:03,680
Okay, that actually really helps blood build up just probably no phase two any second I would prefer

2288
03:26:05,520 --> 03:26:07,520
What the fuck

2289
03:26:09,280 --> 03:26:11,280
Uh, I don't remember her doing that before

2290
03:26:30,800 --> 03:26:32,800
Oh man

2291
03:26:39,040 --> 03:26:41,040
Oh

2292
03:26:44,080 --> 03:26:50,240
I didn't know that I didn't know that with the NPCs were gone. That was a big sword

2293
03:26:53,680 --> 03:26:55,040
I know she's strong to magic

2294
03:26:55,040 --> 03:26:58,480
I'm just doing that because it helps with the blood build up because then I can just spam it

2295
03:26:59,280 --> 03:27:05,520
And then I because I'm moving around my hitbox is is a little bit different and like I teleport a little bit

2296
03:27:05,600 --> 03:27:07,600
And so it's hard for her to get me

2297
03:27:08,960 --> 03:27:10,960
You

2298
03:27:12,640 --> 03:27:16,800
You can get the magic great shorts to uses it's not like a carrion

2299
03:27:18,160 --> 03:27:20,160
slicer, right

2300
03:27:20,240 --> 03:27:25,280
Rina, I don't know if I could do this with you on my lap. I'm kind of like I'm not in the best position right now

2301
03:27:27,360 --> 03:27:29,360
Of course

2302
03:27:29,920 --> 03:27:31,920
No problem

2303
03:27:38,480 --> 03:27:40,480
Oh

2304
03:27:48,160 --> 03:27:50,160
Oh, okay

2305
03:27:51,280 --> 03:27:53,840
I see I see sorry to smack my mic

2306
03:27:55,120 --> 03:27:57,120
Rina

2307
03:27:58,640 --> 03:28:03,280
I'm gonna give you a hug and then put you on the ground. No, okay. She climbed my shoulder and

2308
03:28:03,840 --> 03:28:05,840
Oh

2309
03:28:06,080 --> 03:28:11,680
Oh, you want to hug Rina? I'll give you a hug. I'll give you a big hug Rina

2310
03:28:15,600 --> 03:28:20,080
I want her weapon so bad and then I want to get like a dual wielding talisman

2311
03:28:21,440 --> 03:28:23,440
There you go

2312
03:28:25,280 --> 03:28:27,280
Uh stretch my leggies

2313
03:28:33,520 --> 03:28:46,400
Okay, you know what I think the gang bang method was it

2314
03:28:48,160 --> 03:28:51,920
I think I'm just gonna cheese her with the gang bang method

2315
03:28:55,440 --> 03:28:57,440
Hurry up

2316
03:28:57,600 --> 03:29:06,400
I hate that they load in like they're actually being fucking summoned from a multiplayer game. It doesn't make any sense to me

2317
03:29:19,040 --> 03:29:25,680
She's fucking off me. I'm just hoping she wouldn't do that. Okay bring her in the water boys bring her in the water

2318
03:29:27,600 --> 03:29:31,760
Boys water boys bring her in the water

03:29:35,840 --> 03:29:37,840
Oh my god bring her in the fucking water

03:29:42,720 --> 03:29:44,720
Guys please bring her over here

2321
03:29:48,640 --> 03:29:51,680
Ah my mimic is just fucking rocking her shit

2322
03:29:51,680 --> 03:29:57,200
I can't even see what the fuck is happening bro

2323
03:30:01,200 --> 03:30:08,960
Anytime I try to get over there. They're just fucking going crazy and I my uh thinking this freaks out

2324
03:30:12,800 --> 03:30:14,800
Hit the blood proc hit the blood proc

2325
03:30:22,640 --> 03:30:24,640
Okay back the fuck up

2326
03:30:34,400 --> 03:30:38,640
I forgot that that is such a huge fucking reach for no reason

2327
03:30:41,680 --> 03:30:47,680
Oh what I didn't even know that was going for me. I don't understand how she can how

2328
03:30:49,520 --> 03:30:51,520
How

2329
03:30:51,680 --> 03:30:53,680
How

2330
03:31:00,560 --> 03:31:02,560
Lita do something

2331
03:31:16,080 --> 03:31:18,080
Yeah, it's gonna be careful

2332
03:31:21,680 --> 03:31:23,680
You

2333
03:31:28,960 --> 03:31:30,560

2334
03:31:30,560 --> 03:31:33,280
Oh, I thought was like she gone. She's like fuck this shit. I'm out

2335
03:31:34,080 --> 03:31:38,560
What if I like go in when she like hasn't exactly been summoned yet?

2336
03:31:40,800 --> 03:31:42,800
And she still show up I don't fucking know

2337
03:31:43,200 --> 03:31:45,200
Oh

03:31:56,160 --> 03:31:58,160
Get her in the water get in the fucking water

2339
03:32:00,640 --> 03:32:05,440
Why I don't know why I did that. Um, okay, there's gonna gain

2340
03:32:12,800 --> 03:32:15,440
That's gonna aim at me do it. Let's do it

2341
03:32:24,560 --> 03:32:27,200

2342
03:32:30,240 --> 03:32:34,160
Oh, no, I can she's gonna kill me for it. No

2343
03:32:35,120 --> 03:32:37,120
I

2344
03:32:40,160 --> 03:32:43,200
Really wish I had the fucking deal because then I would just fucking let her die

2345
03:32:46,080 --> 03:32:48,080
Summons

2346
03:32:49,120 --> 03:32:51,120
Okay, I'm gonna aggro me

2347
03:32:58,640 --> 03:33:00,640
Lita goes fucking hard

2348
03:33:05,120 --> 03:33:07,120
All right

2349
03:33:16,800 --> 03:33:25,200
This will take a while the the time until my doom stream will probably be Rilana

2350
03:33:35,040 --> 03:33:37,040
Oh

2351
03:33:45,360 --> 03:33:48,960
Okay, that's good. I don't really need this right now

2352
03:34:00,480 --> 03:34:02,480
I don't really need this right now

2353
03:34:04,400 --> 03:34:06,400
You

2354
03:34:11,840 --> 03:34:13,840
Yippie

2355
03:34:15,760 --> 03:34:17,920
Wait, why am I wearing this in the first place?

2356
03:34:22,160 --> 03:34:27,200
Was I just doing it for poise? I still only I only have 40 poise

2357
03:34:27,200 --> 03:34:36,880
I'll actually know I have 61 poise but then I have 40 if I put that on

2358
03:34:42,160 --> 03:34:44,160
Yeah, I know yeah, that's true. That's true

2359
03:34:49,840 --> 03:34:52,960
I just can't see past my giant bod my hot bod

2360
03:34:54,000 --> 03:34:56,000
All right, let's uh, let's do that

2361
03:34:56,000 --> 03:35:04,400
Come on Lita Lita. Oh, sorry. I'm in the fucking equipment screen

2362
03:35:26,000 --> 03:35:28,000
I

2363
03:35:37,200 --> 03:35:39,200
Really killed us yet

2364
03:35:40,640 --> 03:35:47,440
Why do we have her against the wall like this? I just don't think it's a good idea. I also can't see what the fuck is going on

2365
03:35:48,640 --> 03:35:50,640
Oh my gosh, you're gonna kill me

2366
03:35:56,720 --> 03:35:58,720
Oh

2367
03:36:05,680 --> 03:36:07,680
That was a terrible what the fuck

2368
03:36:15,120 --> 03:36:17,920
What did that clip through the fucking floor that was so weird

2369
03:36:21,760 --> 03:36:23,760
I feel like

2370
03:36:24,720 --> 03:36:26,720
I

2371
03:36:26,880 --> 03:36:29,360
My frame rate is being so bad right now

2372
03:36:30,560 --> 03:36:34,800
I'm lagging and there's a lot happening and I don't know what to do with myself

2373
03:36:44,480 --> 03:36:46,900
Armor means nothing compared to fashion

2374
03:36:54,400 --> 03:36:56,400
Ma'am

2375
03:37:01,920 --> 03:37:03,920
Hello

2376
03:37:08,240 --> 03:37:10,240
Stature what

2377
03:37:13,040 --> 03:37:15,040
Okie-dokie

2378
03:37:16,640 --> 03:37:19,120
Okie-dokie, let's go

2379
03:37:24,720 --> 03:37:32,000
I'll just eat that and then I'll heal. No, right. Let me get out of the fucking way

2380
03:37:38,240 --> 03:37:40,880
I don't know why

2381
03:37:42,880 --> 03:37:49,280
Oh, are they gonna aggro me usually they aggro me. Oh, I'm surprised. She's a lot of health Lita. I'm surprised with that

2382
03:37:50,080 --> 03:37:52,080
Oh

2383
03:37:52,640 --> 03:37:57,920
My god, I'm so close to death. Give me out of here. Give me out of here. Give me out of I was locked into an animation because of lag

2384
03:38:02,880 --> 03:38:04,880
I don't

2385
03:38:06,320 --> 03:38:08,320
I feel like I should just be meeting Lita

2386
03:38:10,320 --> 03:38:12,560
Although I do like the blood build up the mimic gives me

2387
03:38:15,600 --> 03:38:18,400
Because like the fraying FPS is just really bad

2388
03:38:19,760 --> 03:38:21,760
I

2389
03:38:22,080 --> 03:38:24,080
Am epi

2390
03:38:25,200 --> 03:38:27,200
Epi epi epi

2391
03:38:28,800 --> 03:38:32,160
The great epi maybe I should wear a light

2392
03:38:40,160 --> 03:38:44,800
You think me making me was solid. All right, I'll try it. I'll try this

2393
03:38:50,240 --> 03:38:52,240
Get in the water

2394
03:38:56,560 --> 03:38:58,560
Get in the fucking water

2395
03:39:01,600 --> 03:39:04,480
How does she cancel me out? I don't

2396
03:39:07,600 --> 03:39:09,600
I'll lead it as blood build up too

2397
03:39:20,080 --> 03:39:22,080
I

2398
03:39:26,640 --> 03:39:28,640
Heal please

2399
03:39:37,520 --> 03:39:39,520
No, fuck I missed it

2400
03:39:42,400 --> 03:39:44,400
Need that riposte

2401
03:39:50,000 --> 03:39:52,000
Oh

2402
03:39:54,960 --> 03:39:56,960
Wow, we didn't do any fucking damage at all

2403
03:40:02,720 --> 03:40:04,720
But I'm seeing blood hit

2404
03:40:13,360 --> 03:40:17,040
Not the dad jokes, okay, let's try me and just the mimic

2405
03:40:19,280 --> 03:40:21,280
I

2406
03:40:26,720 --> 03:40:29,200
Why is Rwanda so hard?

2407
03:40:42,000 --> 03:40:44,000
Okay

2408
03:40:45,440 --> 03:40:47,440
Please don't kill me right off the rip

2409
03:40:50,160 --> 03:40:52,160
No

2410
03:41:05,200 --> 03:41:07,200
I can't

2411
03:41:09,120 --> 03:41:11,600
I feel like I'm fighting Malania all over fucking again

2412
03:41:19,760 --> 03:41:23,680
And sometimes I can't tell if she's gonna attack me or the thing it's like she's all over the fucking place

2413
03:41:29,440 --> 03:41:31,520
Oh see like I didn't know those are gonna be on me

2414
03:41:33,760 --> 03:41:36,720
My mimic's about to die and it's just me

2415
03:41:44,320 --> 03:41:46,320
I need to heal

2416
03:41:47,280 --> 03:41:51,040
No, no, no, no, no

2417
03:41:57,120 --> 03:41:59,120
Oh, I thought I jumped over that

2418
03:42:01,680 --> 03:42:05,840
No, this isn't fair. This is a nice

2419
03:42:06,560 --> 03:42:08,560
Yeah

2420
03:42:14,800 --> 03:42:18,640
Yeah, it's really malania but even more fucking aggressive because malania sometimes just blacks up

2421
03:42:19,120 --> 03:42:22,480
Those backs off and just like stares at you for a bit and then she'll be like

2422
03:42:22,880 --> 03:42:27,680
Woo, and she's left. She's a little bit faster. I feel like but she usually she'll stay in one spot

2423
03:42:29,120 --> 03:42:33,280
When she does like some stuff. Okay. It looks like gang bang is how it's gonna be

2424
03:42:36,080 --> 03:42:38,080
Oh

2425
03:42:46,240 --> 03:42:49,200
Did I oh my god fucking hurry up

2426
03:42:56,640 --> 03:42:59,920
Okay, I'm gonna let it aggro her first

2427
03:43:00,880 --> 03:43:05,920
Oh my god, I'm not locked on so I can't see where the fuck she is

2428
03:43:09,520 --> 03:43:11,520
Lock on her lock on her. Thank you

2429
03:43:18,080 --> 03:43:20,080
It has a lot of health so we're fine

2430
03:43:20,960 --> 03:43:22,960
Oh

2431
03:43:28,480 --> 03:43:30,480
Fuck my poise I just

2432
03:43:51,040 --> 03:43:53,040
I

2433
03:43:58,640 --> 03:44:00,640
Or someone else

2434
03:44:03,360 --> 03:44:05,360
We're not even doing as much damage as I was hoping

2435
03:44:15,760 --> 03:44:17,760
All right

2436
03:44:20,880 --> 03:44:22,880
I

2437
03:44:31,200 --> 03:44:34,480
Stop using fucking that sort of fucking magic on him

2438
03:44:37,600 --> 03:44:39,600
Oh, give me that

2439
03:44:41,360 --> 03:44:43,360
All right

2440
03:44:43,920 --> 03:44:45,920
Oh

2441
03:44:47,440 --> 03:44:55,360
No, oh my gosh the fault like you think she's only gonna do it like once or twice, but then she'll just keep doing the follow-up

2442
03:45:02,080 --> 03:45:05,280
You think moon veils attack is better because it doesn't move you

2443
03:45:07,840 --> 03:45:09,840
I don't I have to disagree

2444
03:45:10,720 --> 03:45:15,920
Honestly if I had bloodhounds fang that'd be pretty fine like you could probably beat it with bloodhounds fang

2445
03:45:17,120 --> 03:45:21,680
Because I think the ability to move and like dodge her is very important

2446
03:45:22,320 --> 03:45:25,840
Because otherwise you're like you're gonna be like me and just spam roll the entire time

2447
03:45:28,160 --> 03:45:30,160
Hello, hi

2448

2457
03:46:27,520 --> 03:46:30,160
And add blood or like poison

03:46:36,160 --> 03:46:38,160

2460
03:46:40,760 --> 03:46:42,760

03:53:30,520 --> 03:53:32,520
Or I can just do one of each

Yeah, I'll do that. So then they have double and I'll just have like one

2510
03:53:37,880 --> 03:53:43,560

I'm kind of trying to get her to aggro me and come over here, but she's not taking the bait

2517
03:54:43,040 --> 03:54:45,040
