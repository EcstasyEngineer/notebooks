00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Do I want to be here or do I want to be in my bedroom?

11
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I do not know

12
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Hi

13
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,720
Yeah, I'm trying to figure this out right now. Um

14
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:42,160
Try to remember my other EA login. I'm very sorry about this. I wish I noticed this earlier, but I didn't

15
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,520
Really think of it as an issue

16
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,640
Hello, hi

17
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,640
Hi everyone

18
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:59,560
Okay, I'm a little bit so you can hear it, but I hope you guys are doing that. We can at least chat while I figure this out

19
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:06,200
Otherwise, they'll just play one of the other games that I had planned this week and we'll swap the days

20
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,200
It's not really a big deal. Um

21
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:16,600
Well, I'm not team for it. Well, I'll plan that another time like I've never played Team Fortress 2. Um, I

22
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,120
Also want to play Gary's Mob with you guys at some point

23
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,040
Let me see if I can find my other EA account hold on

24
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,880
It's just the one I use because I bought it as Rena all my games

25
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:35,800
I just buy as Rena and I family share over just and that's how we you know own the games and stuff

26
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,320
So we don't have to worry about

27
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:43,480
Like issues buying games and not owning the games. So I just gotta find it

28
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,120
Well, what's going on, did you have a good day today?

29
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,640
What what do you mean? What?

30
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,680
Oh, like what I never played Team Fortress

31
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,160
I'm sorry. I'll also I'm gonna be a ventriloquist for a second

32
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,320
Why is this

33
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,920
Everything's so low the heck my cats have been messing with my stuff

34
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:11,560
Before I started stream. I was almost late. Boomi knocked over uh Fia's water and was

35
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,440
stomping on her

36
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,320
It was quite annoying and I'm like he was trying to get to her food and I'm like dude. What are you?

37
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,760
Why do you just you just got fed like let her eat? You don't have to take her food

38
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:31,720
I might have to start feeding Boomi separately because I think he's been taking rena's food and that makes me mad

39
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,880
Lol I saved the password, but I never saved

40
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,440

82
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,080
Get rated get rated. Hi. Hello

83
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,600
Hello

84
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,120
Hi reflens. Hello reflens. Hello

85
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,680
We were just about to start Titanfall, but then I realized that

86
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,040
uh

87
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:44,120
EA sucks and they don't do family sharing for games

88
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:49,400
So I'm just gonna buy it again. What sucks is that I bought it when it was like two bucks and now it's $30

89
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,760
so I guess

90
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,760
EA gets its money either way, so

91
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,880
So I'm just buying it off this kill

92
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:01,560
She didn't want you anymore. It's okay. It's okay reflens. I'll take care of yours

93
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:07,160
I'll take such good care of you as long story's away. I swear to you. I swear it

94
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,760
I'll give you my off

95
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:16,760
Um, but yeah, so I shouldn't have to install it again, which is fine

96
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,760
Which I just have to because it's installed on my computer. I thought I could get around it

97
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,720
and just like launch the game

98
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,120
From my other user, but it didn't let me

99
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,640
Oh, it says nothing

100
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:44,920
You're so sweet. Thank you for the reimbursement. Okay. Mommy needs to go get her credit card. Give me one second

101

00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:05,160
I am very pond though, so I would do something like that

118
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,960
Uh

119
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,960
The funny numbers on the back, uh, it's your social security

120
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:31,880
So can you tell can you tell me what that is? I don't want to save my payment. Actually, I probably should

121
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:37,080
Because this might happen again if I buy another EA game

122
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,840
Perry the platypus

123
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:49,480

132
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:40,920
Oh my god, the game is tweaking out. You guys can't see but there is a rave happening on my screen right now

133
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,880
Oh, it's working serious question if you could get the perms, what persona game would you play if any?

134
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,600
I've never played a persona game

135
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,440
You can shoot me where I stand

136
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,400
This game's already broken. I'm actually going to cry

137
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,120

00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,440
I

141
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,440
Not surprisingly

142
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,720
Oh, I was trying to capture Elden Ring. That's not the

143
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,960
Okay, shut up

144
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,920
I need to change

145
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,640
I need to change this so you guys can hear

146
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,920
Have you seen the new Toblerone? What?

147
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:44,920
There's a new Toblerone and do we need perms? We don't need really perms for anything

148
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,800
Well, we do that depends what we're playing

149
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,920
You know

150
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,320
My hands are sticky. I don't know why

151
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,360
Yeah, we're not we're not Japanese company. Oh

152
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,360
Oh

153
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,840
Sorry, I clicked off and it just got quiet

154
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,960
Please jesus christ

155
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,400
Turn it down

156
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,560
Okay, that's better

157
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:34,920
Subtitles on you write about that. Let's do it real quick. I can't read

158
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,960
that's not it

159
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,960
settings video

160
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:49,160
Um, let me turn everything the fuck down

161
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,880
Um

162
00:19:53,160 --> 00:20:02,280
High ragdolls oh, we don't care what means sun just do medium low fuck medium. It's higher low

163
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,840
Oh, but it's a model detail

164
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,200
Impact marks, I don't really

165
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:18,120
We want high ragdolls though. That's our priority my 1070 can only do so much. Okay

166
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:25,480
Wait ragdolls control are physically accurate. Wait, I don't want them to be accurate actually. Let's turn it all the way down

167
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:36,440
Are they making a timefall three? No, they fucking aren't because apex legends exist because an apex legends sucks

168
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,800
It doesn't suck I just suck at the game

169
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:51,160
Apex legends is fine to be honest. I like I used to sweat on apex when it first came out

170
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:06,200
So I'm playing a mouse and keyboard as you guys know my mouse is broken it keeps double clicking so I won't be good

171
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,600
That's my excuse

172
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,600
My excuses. That's my excuse

173
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,400
Uh

174
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,680
Yes, I also liked apex until I knew it kill a timefall three

175
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,560
um

176
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,640
I'll be double tapping. I'll be double tapping

177
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,280
So again, I haven't played in fps

178
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,920
Since well last october so it's almost been a year

179
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:35,160
Uh, we're gonna do the campaign because do you think I can go into a multiplayer game and

180
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,360
Do it? No, I'm gonna be trash

181
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,640
If I want to do multiplayer lobby gaming

182
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:47,720
I'll probably do destiny because then I can wipe in destiny because I'm okay. I'm I'm pretty decent at destiny

183
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,680
Um, maybe at some point

184
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,720
I'll do a cod lobby with my dad

185
00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:00,360
No, I don't think I'll do that. Everybody will just be rude to us. I think never mind. I take that back

186
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,400
You guys don't get a privilege. I remove that privilege

187
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,720
Uh

188
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,040
Madam titan protects you asmr

189
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,080
but

190
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,800
Hi there

191
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,440
Pilot, please enter the robot

192
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,200
Pilot, please enter my robosy

193
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:39,960
Pilot thinks he's in control, but I'm the one who is in control

194
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:55,480
Sheenie who's sheenie? Yeah, is this real how you just don't want us rosing your dad true

195
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:02,840
They're little lore bits in apex. I hinted titanfall 3. Yeah, no

196
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:09,880
No, they only said that that that bt will be in the in apex. They don't say that there'll be a titan

197
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,440
If there is a titanfall 3

198
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:16,760
I'm sorry. I I am playing the fucking shit out of that game

199
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,640
Just saying

200
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,680
like

201
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,160
I love fps's. I'm not good at them

202
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:30,200
But I love them because I like how sweaty and like because I used to hyper my

203
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:36,200
Special interest when I was younger was cs. Sorry. I just bumped my fucking microphone with cs go matches

204
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,160
And I wanted to be a shoutcaster

205
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,360
I wanted to be cloud nine

206
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,680
That was me. She'd be in cloud nine

207
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,880
You know the first

208
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:53,480
So before I really was a vtuber. I applied with my flush self

209
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:59,720
And I played a lot of overwatch and I played a lot of cs go and the first companies I applied to were hollow

210
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,520
and vsp vspo

211
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,840
en

212
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,560
Back when they asked for stuff a long long time ago

213
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,800
uh

214
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,720
They actually vsp o uh watched my stuff quite a bit

215
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,120
um

216
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:19,880
But I'm kind of happy I wasn't selected because I don't think I would have fit in there

217
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,480
And I like where I am now that I can be crazy

218
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,920
Me and hollow they looked at my video

219
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:31,000
They looked at it hollow watched my my

220
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,720
My audition it was me

221
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,120
Because I never I didn't know what an addition was

222
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,800
I thought they just wanted like a clip of gameplay because again, I'm so used to like

223
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,760
Gaming stuff. They didn't I didn't know they wanted idols

224
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,560
and um

225
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,440
I just sent them a picture of me playing an rpg horror maker game

226
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,600
For two minutes

227
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:55,400
No for five minutes and then I cut it up and I'm just like whoa. Where is this?

228
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:01,080
Oh, wow, this is crazy. Ooh spooky. I'm like, no, it was not good

229
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:05,400
I wasted those people's those people's time and I feel bad. I feel very bad

230
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,360
Yeah, I wouldn't want it any other way. I I am where I belong

231
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,360
Um

232
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:18,280
Something clicked when oh, uh, I've heard of deadlock. I've also

233
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:26,120
Wasn't there an FPS game that just came out that was like overshadowed by black myth who kong and it's like called concord or something

234
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,360
Or conquered. I don't know concord

235
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,320
Just kidding this just looks like

236
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,520
Guardians of the galaxy meets fortnight

237
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,960
the heck

238
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,960
What is this?

239
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,960
6% like this video game

240
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:55,400
It's an epia polish by sony. Okay

241
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,840
Weird

242
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:03,560
To it. Oh, it's only 700 players. Oh, that's uh

243
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,480
The robot king. He's the robot king

244
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:15,160
Um, but let me take off my I'm wearing my watch. Let me take that off my tomagotchi is uh, currently sick and dying

245
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,120
It's fine. Don't worry about it. I mean, I'm trying to

246
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,440
dude, the

247
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,440
accidentally turned off my monitor

248
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,040
Fuck

249
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,160
The go XLR is so freaking big

250
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,200
that I have no room on my desk

251
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,440
and

252
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,440
I'm literally gonna

253
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:44,920
I'm moving my monitors so I have more freaking mouse space

254
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,920
Yeah, moving. Why is there so much litter? Where did this come from?

255
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:54,680
What the heck is this? There's like a pile of litter on my desk. Oh my god. My cats. I just

256
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,640
and there's like a

257
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,720
Cat claw. I don't even

258
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,840
Where can I where can I fucking put this?

259
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,720
Go XLR too big

260
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,360
Make that smaller. It doesn't need to be that big

261
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,400
Can I borderless windowed this kind of sucks

262
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,280
No, please

263
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,640
Okay, full screener. Okay, whatever. I'll just play windowed then

264
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:40,600
Yeah, Concord Concord. How am I supposed to know? You just said the same thing

265
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:45,080
You're spelling it. It doesn't help. Tell me the tone

266
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,120
Zumba needs the ramp. Yeah, accurate

267
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,680
Let me make you guys smaller

268
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,600
Because you guys are ticking up my entire screen and I can't see OBS at all

269
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,160
You little chonkertins

270
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,160
I need a tweet that I'm live

271
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:07,720
Oh my god, buddy might actually work on Concord finally broken game history. Oh that sucks

272
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,920
Concord. Okay. Thank you

273
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,280
One cord cord drillian players

274
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,400
Concord's bad for a day. Ooh

275
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,520
I think Shawnee's playing that didn't she already play that Concord's bad for a day

276
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,280
I remember I remember that game

277
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:29,960
I remember watching other people play that game because and I all the stuff going over my head because I was so young

278
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:34,040
Um, I didn't know that that was like kind of slightly a dirty game

279
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:41,000
Uh, let's get to Twitter then I never I never tweeted that I was streaming in the first place

280
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,160
But honestly, that's fine. I was doing other stuff. It's not a big deal

281
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:54,200
Sorry, it's so quiet. It's because I click when I click off it fades away as you can hear

282
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,400
It doesn't continuously keep playing

283
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,280
Oh my god

284
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,440
Come on we are playing

285
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:11,000
Titan tall Titan tall Titan fall

286
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,800
Two baby

287
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:18,440
Live rn from saturday night. It's she be

288
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,800
Can I get the link?

289
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,760
Or

290
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:32,040
Need I need to put up a little red dot so people know I'm alive. I mean that I'm live not that I'm alive

291
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,560
I hope they already know that I'm alive. I hope they know I'm not dead

292
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:41,080
Although I was dying during the member stream yesterday because people kept drawing

293
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,040
dead people

294
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:48,280
And I'm like, oh my god, you fucking killed me. Are you fucking and they kept killing my dead?

295
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:54,200
And but like in a nice way like we would like draw something and it'll be like a picture of like a harlot and like

296
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,680
A bleeding heart like having dinner having a romantic dinner together

297
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,680
But then because we're playing garter phone and then we're playing like the knockoff

298
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:07,880
Drawings so people would have to like have a certain amount of time to look at something then draw it from memory and then

299
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:15,480
People would accidentally like just end up drawing things as like dead bodies and I'm like guys. Why did you get like did you bought boomie dead?

300
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:22,360
I'm like, what is wrong with you? You messed up the snippet. No, I didn't I drew the snippet fine

301
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,560
I thought my snippet was the best. I'm not gonna lie

302
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:31,640
Yeah, and then people kept drawing with like the shape tool and it was like really bad, but really funny

303
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:36,680
Anyone would only draw. Yeah. Nope. I was the only one that drew all five members

304
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,960
Everybody else always missed somebody and I'm like, wow

305
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,120
rude

306
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,120
Sometimes it was me and I'm like

307
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,280
Oh

308
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:54,440
Six shut up, you know what I meant only I said only five not all five

309
00:30:55,560 --> 00:31:00,760
You did it to yourself. No, I didn't I I can go back. I can I saved a bunch of them

310
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:05,240
All right, I saved a bunch of them. I need to move my big-ass head out the way

311
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:12,120
I'll throw myself over respawn entertainment. They deserve better, but

312
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,280
yeah, so

313
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,400
um

314
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,480
Yeah, it's in the game

315
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,080
Is that too loud

316
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:35,480
Of all the things I've seen on the battlefields of the frontier

317
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,920
The pilot is the true dominant force

318
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,280
Yeah, I'm a dominant force

319
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
It's fast and agile

320
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:54,680
Graceful yet devastating isn't like Matt Mercer voices Jack Cooper. I can't recall resourceful

321
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,080
And relentless six the pilot sees the world differently

322
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,680
She will become flanking roots

323
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:12,040
Pilots fight differently

324
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,720
Experienced in deception. Okay. I played the campaign

325
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:22,840
About a year ago. So hopefully last October. So hopefully I can remember what the hell I'm doing

326
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:28,920
So I'm not wandering for hours, but what truly separates the pilot from all the guns and machines of the battlefield

327
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,920
Is the bond between a pilot and a titan?

328
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,640
It's in the robot

329
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,600
Harlan

330
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,880
Oh, sorry, I clicked on youtube studio

331
00:32:54,120 --> 00:33:00,440
When linked to a titan a pilot can only be stopped by overwhelming force or an equal

332
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,120
Shit

333
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,320
The frontier has been the only home I've ever known

334
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:14,680
The final frontier our lands have been destroyed by the IMC

335
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,240
The YMCA taking our resources

336
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,200
Polluting and destroying our planets

337
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,840
It's funny because this looks like a real

338
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:27,160
That doesn't look like video game footage. It looks like they just green screen some dudes over it

339
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,520
Which is very interesting to me. It's still it's still like pretty good cinematic

340
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,680
Defeated

341
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:38,280
Now I say live action. I don't know. I couldn't word fighting to free the frontier

342
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,880
This is all real too. I'm a long way from the pilot

343
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,120
Fact this came out in 2016

344
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:52,760
I hope I can live up to the honor. I'll go punch

345
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,840
I

346
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:01,480
Hope I can live up to the titan fall too. Oh, I said it. I'm kidding

347
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:09,480
Hold on. Let me uh, I'm gonna turn the thing on that so my face reflects the lighting on the screen

348
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,840
No wrong thing

349
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,360
Select

350
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,720
Yeah

351
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,360
Am I too small do I need to be bigger?

352
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,640
I think I need to be bigger. I'm a little I'm a little tiny

353
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,360
Am I echoing?

354
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,600
Why do I feel like I hear a reverb but my stuff isn't on?

355
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,320
I'll press space to continue

356
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,800
All right, let me let me sit up. Let me lock in let me move

357
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,960
Here we go

358
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:57,080
My name's rifleman cotton bum. She must have power-cycled the simpons since last time. Yeah, we'll have to recalibrate it

359
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,920
Does that feel right to you kupa? Yeah

360
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:17,720
All right, we're good to go. This is looking up and down how much you remember from last time

361
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:22,520
Setting the neural link not quite the same as a titan link, but it's similar

362
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,640
Gamer stance

363
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:30,200
We need to be in the right state of mind. I wish I could raise my

364
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,200
arm rest much. Maybe I need to make myself a little bit taller

365
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,920
No, I'm small

366
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,480
Maybe higher up

367
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:47,720
I'm pretty control. Yeah, I don't know why someone with the very controls

368
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,480
Okay

369
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,440
Yeah, this chair doesn't have uh

370
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:03,720
Arm rest uh like raising. All right, technically I'm not supposed to be training you

371
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,440
Yeah

372
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:11,400
Enabling jump kid assist jump kids. I can't over on yin

373
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:15,480
Once your jump kid calibrates to your movement style

374
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:22,120
And the house mobility becomes second nature. I might have to I just realized I might have to cut my nails to play

375
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:29,800
Because I'm slipping over the what is this destiny inspired by my home planet of harmony. Yeah

376
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,840
Oh

377
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,840
All right

378
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,120
Where's my jump feel weird I feel like my gravity just changed

379
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:59,480
Well, I would just cut them down and I wouldn't cut them off like I still would have nail polish on

380
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:05,720
I'm not listening to him. I'm so sorry. Oh, that's ward

381
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:18,120
Going for golden time trial. Uh, let's see. I prefer the rto one

382
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,920
Let's see how bad I am load your weapon

383
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,920
Oh, yeah, guys, I'm gonna have to cut my nails

384
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:38,280
Because I can't my fingernails hold on. I'm walking in I was gonna cut them down anyways, they'll just be short

385
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,280
I was gonna have to do this at one point for the

386
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,280
Just

387
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,800
You can focus more tightly on your target

388
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:04,360
It's also just uncomfortable to play with like a clacky keyboard and long nails

389
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:10,120
I don't know how girls do it. Uh, I'll be honest with you aim down the sides when engaging more distance

390
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,120
So like I'll I'll let's let's do

391
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:18,440
Because I only need to technically cut off like two nails. Uh, then people will think I'm a lesbian though

392
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:26,760
You can focus more tightly on your target because you have to like play like I play with the tips of my fingers

393
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,560
and like obviously I have nails there so like

394
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,200
That'll be fine actually

395
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,320
It's just like moving around and strafing might not be the best

396
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:41,400
Good because I I accidentally pressed the w key

397
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,040
Do I need to do how many times you have to do this?

398
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:58,840
This makes me miss uh, what's it called?

399
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,760
Hand cannons from destiny

400
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:11,640
Pressing all the keys wait, you're not that means you guys would be women so

401
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:24,200
I'm experiencing some resistance on my mouse paid my mouse paid my mouse paid it's because there's cat litter on it

402
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,560
Hunter naturally

403
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,920
No, I just I'm just saying I miss hand cannons

404
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,160
See I'm not fast though

405
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,240
Takes me a while to line up my shots. Oh

406
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,800
No, I don't want this though. Can I have a different gun?

407
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,880
My finger keeps slipping out

408
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:53,080
Okay, it's literally it's just this one I need to cut it's just my ring finger

409
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:05,800
You thought I was blowing smoke off the barrel like a cowboy my dad's a warlock main on destiny

410
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,240
Sorry, I'm just cutting my nail

411
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,040
There we go

412
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,360
Right no no yep, I'm gonna have to cut off my entire

413
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,560
I

414
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,320
Practice as much as you want then meet me at the gauntlet

415
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,800
Yeah, I'll be right there. Give me a fucking second bro. I'm trying to walk in

416
00:40:41,800 --> 00:41:00,600
Thanks we do for games. What did I play? What do you mean? I played a lot of crucible and destiny if that's what you're asking

417
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:09,080
Face that yeah, my dad, uh, then he tried playing titan, but you didn't like it. So he like he prefers warlock

418
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,800
My dad usually will play like

419
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,760
What's it called

420
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,160
He'll play like

421
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:25,000
fast characters or like magical like long range characters

422
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:29,560
But he never actually could get the hang of the hunter that will

423
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,760
he

424
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,000
Yeah, I think he just like the medium speed of uh

425
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,880
A warlock

426
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,440
So cut my thumb

427
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,160
I actually I ripped my thumbnail. So that's why I was gonna cut these anyways because they're so long

428
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:49,400
I almost ripped my thumbnail off when I was opening boxes

429
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,680
Ow

430
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,680
My nail just shot me in the face

431
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:58,920
What the fuck did that go? Hello? I went down my shirt. I can't

432
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,920
I

433
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,800
I'm wearing the onesie. This isn't gonna work

434
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,400
Get it out

435
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:18,120
No, I'm not a nail gun. Um

436
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:25,400
Yeah, I was opening a box and I tore my nail bit my nail back, you know, I like looked at it and I was like

437
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,480
Ah

438
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:30,120
But it's fine like it was just bleeding a little bit

439
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,840
This is not

440
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:45,000
Nice, okay, I need a nail file to smooth these puppies down

441
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:53,640
Yeah, I know it hurt like a pitch. I tore my nail bed just a little bit. It went up a little bit. Oh, okay

442
00:42:55,640 --> 00:43:01,800
I have one hand short and one hand long. Practice as much as you want. Then meet me at the gauntlet

443
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:09,640
But I don't like long nails are fine when I use a mouse. I'll cut those later

444
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,640
I

445
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,160
Anyways, I'm gonna pretend like you're doing my nails with this along

446
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:29,640
Oh my god, that would be such a good role play what the heck I do your nails

447
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,080

448
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:37,080
Tell me about you, you know your girlfriend. You got a girlfriend

449
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,800
Is she cute

450
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,960
You guys gonna have babies

451
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,760
You're getting married

452
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,920
Oh, you don't have a girlfriend

453
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,800
You want one?

454
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,040

You did did you kill did you a killer? Why are you saying did?

00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,400
She's a very cute bunny girl. I don't know what a bunny girl is sugar

457
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:11,240
But I don't is that like some sort of sex thing like

458
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,600
I don't have any chewing gum

459
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,320
So like

460
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,800
How big's your dick

461
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:30,920
Anyways, um, sorry I have to rest um

462
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:37,080
Your nail beds are really nice. They're cuticle just needs to be cut back a little bit

463
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:42,760
She wears the ears in bed interesting interesting

464
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,840
Yeah

465
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:53,480
I can't speak another language and that's stereotypical

466
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,960
Oh

467
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:01,080
My it really hurts to file down my thumb

468
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:09,640
But I need to beautiful my nails still look really good. They're just short now

469
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,400
You know your brother

470
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,400
I heard

471
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,200
Was one of those homophones. Is that true?

472
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,160
You know, I love the homophones

473
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,120
They're really nice people

474
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:29,640
69?

475
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,640
My god

476
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:35,080
This is more of a jersey than a than a boss an accent

477
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,680
Nice nice you

478
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:52,440
You

00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:59,960
Cool

480
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:04,760
All right, I have my boba tea that has whole milk in it. So I'll probably fucking die later. That's fine

481
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,960
Like lewis or lois

482
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,680
We'll run the gauntlet

483
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,600
Peta, you know, yeah, brother's one of those homophones

484
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:23,320
I think bryan's a homophone. Do you think bryan thinks that?

485
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,680
Oh, yeah, this is much better. Oh, fuck. Yeah. Okay. Let's go

Okay, I turned off my monitor again, it's fine

489
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:48,440
Just kidding I unplugged it plug it back in

490
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:53,560
Don't worry. I can't see anything

491
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:13,000
No, no, what am I doing? Am I killing people?

492
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,800
I almost fell off

493
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:22,040
Why am I running 20? Oh, I thought I was running 22 miles an hour

494
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,920
Oh, they're not even shooting at me this is boring

495
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,920
What

496
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:40,520
What I want you to shoot over the shoulder

497
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:46,280
What the fuck hide his outline his head

498
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:07,160
I don't even know what I'm doing

499
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,880
Oh

500
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:24,440
Is there any other dudes that I miss? Oh wait, there's

501
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:27,160
Yeah

502
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:30,040
I think I killed him that I don't fucking know

503
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:35,320
Nice run see the results board on the wall. That's a regular

504
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,520
Because I just kept pausing

505
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:47,080
Look at the results board for more tips on how to improve. I see I didn't fucking notice there's two guys. I miss

506
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,760

01:16:53,420 --> 01:16:58,460
Pilot I advise against turning yourself over to the IMC. It wasn't planning on a BT

767
01:17:02,620 --> 01:17:05,500
Don't worry, I'm not going anywhere. If I just ignored him

Okay, oh somehow I made that

01:17:52,620 --> 01:17:54,620
You think we can survive through this BT

776
01:17:54,860 --> 01:18:00,460
We have no other options. We will have to improvise and attack if we wish to survive. Don't worry about it

777
01:18:05,340 --> 01:18:08,860
How long did you serve with last time osa? Oh last time osa

785
01:19:19,180 --> 01:19:21,180
Oh, he could see me he could see me

I'm wearing my hood and I don't mean to why are you gonna kill me and throw me into I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die

804
01:21:09,020 --> 01:21:11,020
I need cover

805
01:21:11,980 --> 01:21:13,980
Yeah, I am gonna use that right now

806
01:21:15,260 --> 01:21:17,660
So I wonder my hat came on. Hello

Let's do so over there

811
01:21:53,180 --> 01:21:56,460
Oh, I shot right over your shoulder, buddy. I'm not a good sniper

812
01:22:00,460 --> 01:22:02,460
What is it

813
01:22:05,180 --> 01:22:09,100
Why aren't you dying? All right, I guess that just doesn't work

814
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:13,900
Oh

815
01:22:30,460 --> 01:22:32,460
Please hold

816
01:22:32,620 --> 01:22:36,860
Thankfully like the AI sucks. So I like it's it's hard for me to die

817
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:41,260
Unless I like throw myself at a stupid situation like I've been often doing

818
01:22:43,420 --> 01:22:45,820
Because I'm not good the AI is just bad

819
01:22:49,820 --> 01:22:53,100
Oh, I didn't see I also bad vision. I didn't see them there

820
01:22:56,620 --> 01:23:00,220
No, no, no, did I burp? I don't even know

821
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:04,060
Do not even recall

822
01:23:07,740 --> 01:23:10,540
BT who is this voice?

823
01:23:15,660 --> 01:23:17,660
I think I also got lost in here last time

824
01:23:21,340 --> 01:23:26,300
Is anyone alive? I don't know you fucking tell me pilot. Does it look like anybody's alive?

825
01:23:27,900 --> 01:23:33,900
Excuse me, but 90% of the lifeboats have been ejected. There is still hope

826
01:23:37,420 --> 01:23:39,900
I think I recall that I have to jump up here

827
01:23:41,660 --> 01:23:43,660
Oh my god, please

828
01:23:44,060 --> 01:23:45,820
No

829
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:47,580
Am I stupid?

830
01:23:47,580 --> 01:23:49,580
Okay, I'm stupid

831
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:53,340
Go the way I was going this clear bright fucking light

832
01:23:55,260 --> 01:23:58,140
And then I had to oh fuck uh

833
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:03,660
Oh, yes, I was going up. I remember getting stuck there because I didn't realize I had to go fucking up

834
01:24:04,620 --> 01:24:06,620
It's time to crawl into the little vent

835
01:24:07,660 --> 01:24:09,980
Which is like the same size as that fucking hole

836
01:24:11,660 --> 01:24:13,660
I wish I would stop holding

837
01:24:33,980 --> 01:24:35,980
Oh

01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:39,820
Hello, can you hear me?

839
01:24:41,260 --> 01:24:45,020
Do I have a custom keyboard? Oh, no, I just have a black widow. Of course

840
01:24:45,900 --> 01:24:53,100

01:25:02,140 --> 01:25:04,140

Sussy number Bravo tango sussie number Bravo. Oh chassis. Let's use it sussie

01:25:37,580 --> 01:25:39,580
My location has been compromised

01:25:41,420 --> 01:25:43,420
Oh, yeah, it's crazy

848
01:25:44,060 --> 01:25:51,020
Um, what do I do? Oh, I have to secure the area. Oh, this is awkward. Oh, I should have reloaded a really long time ago

849
01:25:51,020 --> 01:25:53,020
Oh, I'm out of fucking ammo

850
01:25:53,580 --> 01:25:55,580
Oh

851
01:25:55,660 --> 01:25:59,020
Oh, bt. You're on your own bro. I'm sorry. I'm out of here

852
01:26:01,100 --> 01:26:05,580
Um, give me a second. Give me a second. Give me a second

853
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:15,900
You're fucking why are you still alive?

854
01:26:21,820 --> 01:26:23,820
Jesus

855
01:26:26,780 --> 01:26:32,780
Yeah, let's complete the neural link immediately. Please install the final battery. Please insert your battery into me

856
01:26:35,100 --> 01:26:37,100
Hello, hello

857
01:26:39,260 --> 01:26:42,860
Sounds more like the blue. No, I'm not using a ducky keyboard right now

858
01:26:42,940 --> 01:26:46,300
This is I don't even I can't even recall what switches are on this pilot

859
01:26:46,460 --> 01:26:50,380
We must establish a neural link in order to proceed. Yeah, I generally don't know what

860
01:26:51,100 --> 01:26:53,100
Please embark when ready

861
01:26:54,780 --> 01:26:57,420
Oh, I'm getting in the fucking robot bro

862
01:27:00,060 --> 01:27:02,060
Man a man just died in here for a second

863
01:27:03,100 --> 01:27:07,020
Getting the fucking robot mad Mercer. Wait, do I have tattoos? What?

864
01:27:07,740 --> 01:27:13,740
Why do I have like cyberpunk tattoos? Cyberpunk means Titanfall protocol one link to pilot

865
01:27:14,380 --> 01:27:16,380
establishing neural link

866
01:27:16,860 --> 01:27:18,860
I'm going ghosts

867
01:27:18,940 --> 01:27:21,820
I'm entering the matrix neural link established

868
01:27:22,460 --> 01:27:28,060
Rifleman jack kubernetes. You are now confirmed as acting pilot of bt 7274

869
01:27:28,860 --> 01:27:30,860
Whoa protocol two

870
01:27:31,020 --> 01:27:35,820
What you don't like tatted up guys. No, that's not a problem. Zoom special operation. I think tats are cool

871
01:27:36,780 --> 01:27:38,780
I like tats

872
01:27:38,780 --> 01:27:40,300
Pretty indifferent

873
01:27:40,300 --> 01:27:43,340
I'm detecting incoming enemy forces. Yeah, I wish I could fucking see

874
01:27:44,140 --> 01:27:45,660
protect the pilot

875
01:27:45,660 --> 01:27:47,660
re-initializing critical systems

876
01:27:49,820 --> 01:27:56,620
The vortex shield on line the vortex shield catches incoming rounds and missiles release the button to launch

877
01:27:57,420 --> 01:27:59,420
I just got fucking obliterated

878
01:28:02,940 --> 01:28:04,940
Please

879
01:28:06,300 --> 01:28:08,300
Can I move?

880
01:28:09,260 --> 01:28:11,260
Oh

881
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:27,100
Okay, that's great the warlocks you will achieve okay these kill them all

882
01:28:27,100 --> 01:28:29,100
Yeah

883
01:28:33,660 --> 01:28:38,940
Neuralink complete primary weapon control and motion link. Can I fucking move? I hate this

884
01:28:41,420 --> 01:28:47,980
Yeah, let's go get absolutely right what they just disappeared pilot enemy titanfall detected

885
01:28:48,060 --> 01:28:51,740
I just like stepping on people to be honest with you. Is that fucked up on me?

886
01:28:51,820 --> 01:28:54,300
I just like stomping on people and I tighten and hearing them scream

887
01:28:55,020 --> 01:29:01,500
Yeah, it's gonna kill a few bad guys still too bad. Yeah, I'm gonna kill a man who already killed dozens of men

888
01:29:05,260 --> 01:29:07,760
All right, let's fuck me bro. Ah

889
01:29:18,460 --> 01:29:20,460
Battery required

890
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:27,260
Oh, give me your fucking shit, bro

891
01:29:35,020 --> 01:29:40,780
Stompy murder robots our mission of rendezvousing with major anderson until then you and I are on

01:29:48,940 --> 01:29:50,940
Oh

895
01:29:51,180 --> 01:29:54,140
Perfect little place to run with my little robot self

896
01:30:00,140 --> 01:30:02,540
Why does that why does my hood keep coming up?

897
01:30:05,180 --> 01:30:07,180
I'm not even pressing that number

898
01:30:09,500 --> 01:30:15,900
It's one of my attacks like I don't know how you guys doing

899
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:21,740
Is this amazing for you

900
01:30:23,980 --> 01:30:30,220
You're like, wow, she shit will continue to search for us our only chance of survival is to rendezvous with major anderson

901
01:30:30,380 --> 01:30:32,380
60 clicks from our

902
01:30:32,780 --> 01:30:34,780
Anderson

903
01:30:35,260 --> 01:30:37,260

908
01:31:19,420 --> 01:31:21,420
Oh

917
01:32:23,900 --> 01:32:25,900
I am confused

918
01:32:26,460 --> 01:32:29,580
Saying there's a tie. Oh, what the hell you'll be more fun when you take

919
01:32:30,380 --> 01:32:32,380
I bet you'll be more fun when you're fucking at full

920
01:32:33,340 --> 01:32:35,340
You're lucky that shit is there

921
01:32:36,060 --> 01:32:38,540
I crouch. Oh, I can't

922
01:32:40,780 --> 01:32:42,780
I can't reach me

923
01:32:46,460 --> 01:32:48,700
Lieutenant Shaver that's a name

924
01:32:50,460 --> 01:32:52,460
You're late. How dare

925
01:32:52,780 --> 01:32:54,780
Let's go lieutenant

926
01:32:55,820 --> 01:32:58,460
I think uh boss boy is up here. We got his name

927
01:33:00,060 --> 01:33:02,060
Oh, I'm stepping on you motherfuckers

928
01:33:02,780 --> 01:33:08,620
All forces move in come here come here. Come here. I'm stepping on you

929
01:33:15,820 --> 01:33:20,060
Shoot me motherfucker shoot me. Oh what I hope you're paying attention violence

930
01:33:22,140 --> 01:33:26,860
Hope I'm paying attention. What is that supposed to mean excessive damage warning warning

931
01:33:27,820 --> 01:33:30,860
Excessive damage, I'm fine. Oh, I'm not fine

932
01:33:33,580 --> 01:33:37,660
Why are you jumping I want to jump I don't really need the first core

933
01:33:42,140 --> 01:33:48,140
I need a I need some batteries. I know there's one behind me. I think there's one closer over here. Yeah

934
01:33:48,140 --> 01:33:50,140

Go human do I just get out? Oh shit, I didn't know if I could get out at this point

937
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:16,620
If I are stopped I need to listen to some prodigy while I play this

938
01:34:18,780 --> 01:34:20,780
I need to fire a stall

939
01:34:32,940 --> 01:34:37,980
F1 tone I didn't mean to press E

940
01:34:40,060 --> 01:34:42,060
Sorry

941
01:34:42,140 --> 01:34:44,140
Somebody's in love

942
01:34:44,380 --> 01:34:49,660
A human's concept of love requires aberration like how we started talking before devotion and respect

943
01:34:50,380 --> 01:34:51,900
conclusion

944
01:34:51,900 --> 01:34:53,900
I am 50 percent in love

945
01:34:54,620 --> 01:35:00,060
Hey, yo BT you want to smash you can lock onto enemies and target them with tracking rockets

946
01:35:02,460 --> 01:35:04,460
All right

947
01:35:04,940 --> 01:35:06,940
All right, BT

948
01:35:10,700 --> 01:35:12,700
Destroying

949
01:35:13,660 --> 01:35:15,660
What

950
01:35:29,340 --> 01:35:31,340
Oh, yeah, we're gonna do that

951
01:35:33,900 --> 01:35:35,900
Where are you?

952
01:35:38,540 --> 01:35:40,860
Oh my god, bro stop fucking

953
01:35:41,580 --> 01:35:43,580
I'm running

954
01:35:44,060 --> 01:35:47,100
Thank you. I'll take that. Thank you

955
01:35:49,980 --> 01:35:51,980
Oh

956
01:35:57,740 --> 01:36:02,860
I totally miss it's fine. Don't worry about it. He didn't he didn't notice the damn thing. Um

957
01:36:10,860 --> 01:36:12,860
Oh

958
01:36:19,580 --> 01:36:21,580
Is there a dude over here

959
01:36:26,540 --> 01:36:29,340
Anybody else you must want to get fucking punched all along

960
01:36:30,700 --> 01:36:32,700
Then I'll punch you

961
01:36:34,940 --> 01:36:36,940
I'm stuck

962
01:36:40,860 --> 01:36:42,860
You

963
01:36:45,420 --> 01:36:47,420
Thank you

964
01:36:53,260 --> 01:36:55,340
Oh fuck I can't punch you you two up high

965
01:36:59,100 --> 01:37:01,100
Oh

966
01:37:01,100 --> 01:37:03,100
Hip spray

967
01:37:03,100 --> 01:37:05,820
Hostile pilot you're australian

968
01:37:06,700 --> 01:37:11,660
You are indeed brother

969
01:37:17,660 --> 01:37:19,660
Why do you fucking ninja stars

970
01:37:23,740 --> 01:37:28,940
Oh fuck facility is blocked by a flow regulation gate. There should be a control interface nearby

971
01:37:31,580 --> 01:37:33,580
Who all right

972
01:37:36,620 --> 01:37:41,580
Engaged opening flow regulation gate. Hey, that's pretty stupid

973
01:37:44,700 --> 01:37:47,340
Activating control room safety airlock procedures

974
01:37:49,740 --> 01:37:54,780
Uh the safety airlock has sealed you in the control room. You must find another way out

975
01:37:55,180 --> 01:37:57,180
We have no choice but to split up

976
01:37:58,140 --> 01:38:01,580
Oh crazy, I'll find a way out. Don't you worry BT?

977
01:38:01,980 --> 01:38:05,820
A nearby exit will most likely lead further. Yes. I know I can do executions

978
01:38:05,900 --> 01:38:10,060
I was trying to do it behind him, but it didn't really work out. I just ended up kicking him instead

979
01:38:12,060 --> 01:38:16,940
You got it BT you do the same copy that pilot. Oh, you're not dead

980
01:38:18,460 --> 01:38:21,820
Oh, I just love shooting people in titanfall. I mean

981
01:38:23,820 --> 01:38:25,820
Oh

982
01:38:26,300 --> 01:38:29,580
Give me that caber wait. I have a flat line. Oh

983
01:38:30,540 --> 01:38:34,540
I am such a that just just just if they offer me a gun in a game

984
01:38:34,620 --> 01:38:37,740
Then I'm just assuming they want me to use it. Yeah, like right now

985
01:38:39,180 --> 01:38:42,780
Oh, no scope. Fuck uh 360

986
01:38:52,140 --> 01:38:54,140
You're good, you're fine you're fine, bro

987
01:39:00,540 --> 01:39:04,620
That's for the it's for the clips bro, it's for the clips, of course

01:39:10,140 --> 01:39:17,820
Oh, I weird I didn't know that okay ready ready ready ready ready guys ready ready ready 360 wait

989
01:39:24,140 --> 01:39:27,260
You like that save that for the montage, baby

990
01:39:30,460 --> 01:39:36,300
What we have here my IMC and militia friends cool is a failure to communicate

991
01:39:37,020 --> 01:39:39,020
They hack you

992
01:39:43,180 --> 01:39:45,180
Are you fucking nutting it sounds like it

993
01:39:50,460 --> 01:39:53,660

01:40:02,620 --> 01:40:07,500
Ready 360 no scope 360 no scope

996
01:40:09,020 --> 01:40:11,020
Fuck 360 no scope

997
01:40:12,700 --> 01:40:15,660
Where am I? Oh, okay, this isn't working out

998
01:40:16,380 --> 01:40:18,380
Oh

01:40:20,700 --> 01:40:25,260
Yeah, that sucks. All right, uh, let's work on a 360 no scope ready

Yeah, it's bad, so I'm just fucking around I'm sorry

1021
01:42:26,940 --> 01:42:32,060
And maybe I'm trying to think maybe I should have put on hard mode because I'm just doing stupid stuff

1022
01:42:40,700 --> 01:42:42,700
No, you don't

1023
01:42:43,820 --> 01:42:45,820
Friendly fire let's go

1024
01:42:46,780 --> 01:42:48,780
Damn it. I can't shoot you

1025
01:42:52,620 --> 01:42:54,620

1027
01:43:06,060 --> 01:43:09,100
Oh, that's pretty sick. Uh, you guys any better guns around here?

1028
01:43:10,460 --> 01:43:12,460
I don't really care about that

1029
01:43:12,860 --> 01:43:14,860
Actually, you know what?

1030
01:43:16,140 --> 01:43:18,620

1031
01:43:21,180 --> 01:43:23,180

Yeah

1035
01:43:38,460 --> 01:43:40,460
I didn't know it was a fucking horror game

1036
01:43:46,060 --> 01:43:48,060
It's like a horror game

1037
01:43:52,220 --> 01:43:54,220
Oh, I like that actually

1038
01:44:01,180 --> 01:44:05,820
I don't remember guns. Do you have anything? Sorry, I like I love looting bodies

1039
01:44:07,500 --> 01:44:10,860
Yes, I know I can hack them. I don't care. You don't have to tell me I know people are gonna say

1040
01:44:12,460 --> 01:44:14,460
Oh, what am I doing?

1041
01:44:15,020 --> 01:44:17,020
Oh, you're

01:44:18,140 --> 01:44:20,380
So awkward, how do you guys get over here?

1043
01:44:37,100 --> 01:44:39,580
How are you still alive?

1044
01:44:39,660 --> 01:44:44,620
Uh, he just teleported for some reason. Maybe I should have kept the creeper

1045
01:44:55,660 --> 01:44:57,660
Let me just look at chat for a second

1046
01:44:59,340 --> 01:45:01,740
I'm gonna love Borderlands. Yeah, I am

1047
01:45:03,980 --> 01:45:08,620
Hello, Mr. Obama. Oh, what the fuck are you doing there? You scared me, bro

1048
01:45:10,140 --> 01:45:13,420
All right, uh, let's do a little

1049
01:45:14,620 --> 01:45:17,820
I can't get a bloody shot. It's an all-star

1050
01:45:19,020 --> 01:45:21,020
SMG, hey

1051
01:45:24,140 --> 01:45:28,220
Check your angles. Check your angles. Check your angles

1052
01:45:31,180 --> 01:45:34,060
Got a visual it's a pilot. It's a pilot

1053
01:45:35,740 --> 01:45:37,740
It's a pilot. Sorry

1054
01:45:38,700 --> 01:45:40,700
All right guys, come on down

1055
01:45:44,940 --> 01:45:46,940
Oh never mind

1056
01:45:49,900 --> 01:45:54,540
Oh, you motherfucker. I forgot you're a little bit more tankier. Give me a second

1057
01:46:00,780 --> 01:46:02,780
Do you have a gun?

1058
01:46:08,460 --> 01:46:15,980
Oh, I hate this fucking great. I hate laser-based or like plasma-based guns are my least favorite thing like a destiny. I fucking hate those ones

1059
01:46:17,820 --> 01:46:19,820
Where am I going queen?

1060
01:46:19,820 --> 01:46:21,820
What the fuck?

1061
01:46:22,940 --> 01:46:26,380
Well, I can't go down there so what the shabby

1062
01:46:28,540 --> 01:46:32,540
I know I'm supposed to go in this direction, but I'm not going about it the right way. There it is

1063
01:46:32,700 --> 01:46:34,700
I

1064
01:46:37,820 --> 01:46:41,020
Love the vaulting in this game. It's just so satisfying

1065
01:46:43,980 --> 01:46:48,380
Oh, you're gone. You're literally just disintegrated. Oh Jesus

1066
01:46:49,660 --> 01:46:55,100
Oh, okay. You know what? I'm a kind of a fan of the bloody mist. I'm not I'm not mad about the bloody mist

1067
01:46:55,820 --> 01:47:00,940
It's quite nice. It's just as satisfying as if I was kicking you myself

1068
01:47:03,180 --> 01:47:05,900
You know like it's a little bit

1069
01:47:07,980 --> 01:47:09,980
Highlight out of sight you were just looking at me

1070
01:47:15,260 --> 01:47:18,860
How can he hit me but I can't hit him who is shooting me? Oh

1071
01:47:20,700 --> 01:47:22,700
I don't know why I hit fired, but you know

1072
01:47:25,420 --> 01:47:30,700
Oh, are you spawning in I'd swear how did I walk past all of you?

1073
01:47:33,100 --> 01:47:35,100
Oh

1074
01:47:36,700 --> 01:47:41,500
Actually, I need a different gun. Excuse me. I would like that

1075
01:47:44,380 --> 01:47:46,380
Keeps up

1076
01:47:53,900 --> 01:47:56,140
Maybe they should get better maybe I should have played this one hard

1077
01:47:56,540 --> 01:47:58,540
Oh

1078
01:48:01,340 --> 01:48:05,020
Oh, you're gonna explode I'm gonna die if you explode near me. Yep, I couldn't back up

1079
01:48:09,660 --> 01:48:11,660
Left my spine out

1080
01:48:14,300 --> 01:48:16,620
What that's an interesting checkpoint

1081
01:48:17,580 --> 01:48:20,140
So I got word that there's some vanguard class tight

1082
01:48:22,540 --> 01:48:27,100
My double clip it click is fucking yeah, because it's making me scope in and not what I don't want to

1083
01:48:31,420 --> 01:48:33,420
I need to get away from you

1084
01:48:42,300 --> 01:48:44,300
Oh

1085
01:48:44,940 --> 01:48:46,940

1088
01:49:06,300 --> 01:49:11,820

And then what do you guys do the fucking corner fucking jerking off? Jesus

1091
01:49:27,900 --> 01:49:29,900
In your fire stop

1092
01:49:34,540 --> 01:49:38,940
I like to toggle aim, I don't like hold aim. I prefer to toggle aim. I don't know

1093
01:49:39,820 --> 01:49:41,820

1096
01:50:02,780 --> 01:50:05,500

1100
01:50:35,820 --> 01:50:37,820
Oh

1101
01:50:53,580 --> 01:50:57,580

1102
01:50:58,300 --> 01:51:00,700
You got a battery in your booty cheek. Did you know that?

1103
01:51:01,420 --> 01:51:03,420

Hi

1108
01:51:29,820 --> 01:51:32,460
Your helmet provided me with a live feed of your actions

1109
01:51:32,620 --> 01:51:34,620
I was killed you too

1110
01:51:34,780 --> 01:51:37,740
The controls to deactivate the sludge flower in the next chamber

1111
01:51:38,060 --> 01:51:42,460
Alternate ending where if you don't kill any of the robots you get like the true ending

1112
01:51:45,740 --> 01:51:47,740
I am see security forces

1113
01:51:50,460 --> 01:51:54,620
I guess that's why they pay me the big bucks. You want something done, right? You do it yourself

1114
01:51:55,260 --> 01:51:57,740
All right scrubs enough's enough. I'm coming down

1115
01:51:58,460 --> 01:52:03,020

Die die die die. Where'd your body go? Oh, that's okay

1122
01:52:41,260 --> 01:52:44,620
Uh, I guess it's assuming I won't want me to use this craver

1123
01:52:46,300 --> 01:52:48,300
What? Oh

1124
01:52:53,660 --> 01:52:57,740

01:53:17,900 --> 01:53:21,900
All right, we will need to deactivate the sludge flows in order to regroup

1128
01:53:22,220 --> 01:53:25,260
I have marked the controls on your hood in my hood

1129
01:53:25,900 --> 01:53:27,900
I have marked the controls on your hood

1130
01:53:31,020 --> 01:53:33,020
It was my mercy impression

1131
01:53:35,500 --> 01:53:37,500
Oh, no

1132
01:53:38,300 --> 01:53:40,860

01:53:50,940 --> 01:53:52,940
Oh, fuck, where's the grenade launcher?

1136
01:53:57,100 --> 01:53:59,100
Oh

1137
01:54:00,860 --> 01:54:02,860

1138
01:54:02,860 --> 01:54:04,860
I

1139
01:54:21,500 --> 01:54:23,500
No, why do I have

1140
01:54:24,460 --> 01:54:29,740
The sludge falls contain a high concentration of heavy metals they are interfering with my targeting systems

1141
01:54:30,700 --> 01:54:32,700
I need a better fucking gun

1142
01:54:35,420 --> 01:54:38,540
But everybody's gone kind of fucked myself

1143
01:54:53,980 --> 01:54:56,460
Trying to see if I can have them explode on each other

1144
01:54:58,860 --> 01:55:02,220
Of course, it's a fucking shotgun it doesn't have range, but I don't have a choice

1145
01:55:03,420 --> 01:55:05,420
Thank you

1146
01:55:24,380 --> 01:55:26,380

01:55:42,060 --> 01:55:44,060
Just fucking shoot bro. Just shoot

1149
01:55:44,380 --> 01:55:48,540
Blind firing into my pilot's combat zone would be a violation of protocol three

1150
01:55:53,900 --> 01:55:55,900
Oh

1151
01:55:56,220 --> 01:55:58,220

1169
01:57:33,340 --> 01:57:35,340
She's not emotional support

1170
01:57:37,340 --> 01:57:42,540
Oh, I'm gonna die. Why does this spawn me right there so I have low health. I don't

1171
01:57:47,020 --> 01:57:49,020

1192
02:00:59,580 --> 02:01:01,580

Cain's helmet radio is still intact. We should retrieve it. Oh, okay. Well, sorry. Let me walk back

The ability to decrypt enemy communications has a strong history and I turn into I turn toxic to our advantage

1226
02:04:56,620 --> 02:05:02,140
I don't know in order to survive why my hat thing keeps popping up. I'm not pressing seven

1227
02:05:04,220 --> 02:05:06,460
I'm trying to see what I'm pressing

1228
02:05:09,740 --> 02:05:11,740
Wait, what was it?

1229
02:05:14,940 --> 02:05:18,780
Something's linked. Oh, it's fucking tab

02:05:20,380 --> 02:05:22,860
Why is tab a link to that hold on

1231
02:05:25,340 --> 02:05:27,340
It's my locked-in hood

1232
02:05:29,820 --> 02:05:31,820
I don't know why tab is

1233
02:05:34,700 --> 02:05:37,740
Actually, I can't get rid of it because it's part of the outfit

1234
02:05:38,380 --> 02:05:42,940
Um, and not part of my model, you know, and I guess I'm just gonna be tabbed in hold on. Let me just

1235
02:05:47,020 --> 02:05:49,020
My head's kind of peeking out hold on

1236
02:05:49,420 --> 02:05:51,420
Where'd my mole go?

1237
02:05:52,140 --> 02:05:54,620

Stop running!

1378
02:18:11,060 --> 02:18:15,060
Why would you run? There's no need for you to run.

1379
02:18:16,060 --> 02:18:19,060
I don't even need to shoot my weapon. Don't step on you motherfuckers.

1380
02:18:19,060 --> 02:18:20,060
Oh, come here.

1381
02:18:23,060 --> 02:18:24,060

1383
02:18:28,060 --> 02:18:29,060

02:18:30,060 --> 02:18:32,060
All righty, let's go.

02:18:39,060 --> 02:18:40,060
I'm so sorry.

1386
02:18:43,060 --> 02:18:45,060
I think he's dead. I can't really tell.

1387
02:18:46,060 --> 02:18:47,060
I really have to aim.

1388
02:18:50,060 --> 02:18:52,060
Oh, I'm gonna die.

1389
02:18:55,060 --> 02:18:58,060
Oh, you're looking a little bit too far.

1390
02:18:58,060 --> 02:18:59,060
Oh, wait, did I hit you?

1391
02:18:59,060 --> 02:19:00,060
Oh, yeah, I did.

1392
02:19:05,060 --> 02:19:06,060
Anybody? Come on.

1393
02:19:06,060 --> 02:19:08,060
I want to punch someone like up close.

1394
02:19:13,060 --> 02:19:14,060
Oh, nice.

1395
02:19:16,060 --> 02:19:17,060
This will hurt me, won't it?

1396
02:19:20,060 --> 02:19:21,060
No.

1397
02:19:24,060 --> 02:19:25,060
No? Okay.

1398
02:19:29,060 --> 02:19:30,060
Oh, come on.

1399
02:19:30,060 --> 02:19:32,060
I'm gonna give you some of the punch.

1400
02:19:32,060 --> 02:19:34,060
Oh, yes, come here.

1401
02:19:34,060 --> 02:19:35,060
Come here, come here.

1402
02:19:35,060 --> 02:19:37,060

Oh, yeah, come on.

1404
02:19:39,060 --> 02:19:40,060
Oh, don't run.

1405
02:19:40,060 --> 02:19:42,060
It's not cute.

1406
02:19:44,060 --> 02:19:45,060
Oh.

1407
02:19:46,060 --> 02:19:48,060
Oh, hey, hi, hi.

1408
02:19:48,060 --> 02:19:49,060
Oh, my God.

1409
02:19:49,060 --> 02:19:50,060
That's not as bad as mine,

1410
02:19:50,060 --> 02:19:51,060
because the robots fucked you.

1411
02:19:52,060 --> 02:19:53,060
All right.

1412
02:19:54,060 --> 02:19:55,060
I know there's another Titan.

1413
02:19:55,060 --> 02:19:56,060
Where the fuck did he go?

1414
02:19:56,060 --> 02:19:57,060
Oh.

1415
02:19:59,060 --> 02:20:00,060
Hi.

1416
02:20:01,060 --> 02:20:02,060
Titan, what?

1417
02:20:03,060 --> 02:20:04,060
Oh, what the fuck?

1418
02:20:05,060 --> 02:20:06,060
Jesus.

1419
02:20:07,060 --> 02:20:08,060
What's the matter?

1420
02:20:09,060 --> 02:20:10,060
I don't know.

1421
02:20:11,060 --> 02:20:12,060
Oh, sorry.

1422
02:20:13,060 --> 02:20:15,060
Oh, you shouldn't have been there.

1423
02:20:15,060 --> 02:20:16,060
Okay.

1424
02:20:17,060 --> 02:20:18,060
Sorry.

1425
02:20:31,060 --> 02:20:33,060
Come here, motherfucker.

1426
02:20:36,060 --> 02:20:38,060
I actually don't like the forge build

1427
02:20:38,060 --> 02:20:40,060
to be real with you.

1428
02:20:41,060 --> 02:20:42,060
What the fuck is that?

1429
02:20:43,060 --> 02:20:46,060
I don't even know what this is doing.

1430
02:20:46,060 --> 02:20:47,060
All right, cool.

1431
02:20:48,060 --> 02:20:49,060
Is there a Titan half on fire?

1432
02:20:49,060 --> 02:20:50,060
Oh!

1433
02:20:51,060 --> 02:20:55,060
I'm so fucking stupid.

1434
02:20:56,060 --> 02:20:58,060
I'm so fucking stupid.

1435
02:20:58,060 --> 02:20:59,060
Titan half on fire?

1436
02:21:00,060 --> 02:21:01,060
There you go.

1437
02:21:01,060 --> 02:21:02,060
That's better.

1438
02:21:02,060 --> 02:21:04,060
I like that low, actually.

1439
02:21:06,060 --> 02:21:08,060
BT, why are you suddenly British?

1440
02:21:08,060 --> 02:21:10,060
Don't fucking worry about it.

1441
02:21:10,060 --> 02:21:11,060
Oi, oi, oi, oi.

1442
02:21:12,060 --> 02:21:13,060
Oh, man.

1443
02:21:13,060 --> 02:21:14,060
Is that your son?

1444
02:21:14,060 --> 02:21:15,060
What is that?

1445
02:21:15,060 --> 02:21:16,060
Oh, there's a battery.

1446
02:21:16,060 --> 02:21:17,060
Oh, there's another one.

1447
02:21:19,060 --> 02:21:22,060
You did my pressing half instead of G.

1448
02:21:22,060 --> 02:21:24,060

Come here.

1453
02:21:28,060 --> 02:21:30,060
Session on fire.

1454
02:21:31,060 --> 02:21:35,060
Session on fire.

1455
02:21:37,060 --> 02:21:38,060
Oh.

1456
02:21:38,060 --> 02:21:39,060
My apples.

1457
02:21:39,060 --> 02:21:40,060
You've got my attention.

1458
02:21:42,060 --> 02:21:43,060
I can't even a shot.

1459
02:21:43,060 --> 02:21:44,060
I see you catch this.

1460
02:21:45,060 --> 02:21:46,060
No.

1461
02:21:47,060 --> 02:21:48,060
What the thing for?

1462
02:21:49,060 --> 02:21:50,060
Oh.

1463
02:21:57,060 --> 02:21:58,060
All right.

1464
02:22:00,060 --> 02:22:02,060
Oh, honey.

1465
02:22:02,060 --> 02:22:03,060
Oh, fuck.

1466
02:22:03,060 --> 02:22:05,060
Oh, we backed the fuck up.

1467
02:22:05,060 --> 02:22:06,060
Oh, my God.

1468
02:22:06,060 --> 02:22:07,060
Oh.

1469
02:22:07,060 --> 02:22:08,060
Oh.

1470
02:22:11,060 --> 02:22:12,060
Oh.

1471
02:22:13,060 --> 02:22:14,060
Oh.

1472
02:22:24,060 --> 02:22:25,060
These are like weaker.

1473
02:22:27,060 --> 02:22:28,060
Let me just.

1474
02:22:29,060 --> 02:22:30,060
Let me just.

1475
02:22:30,060 --> 02:22:33,060
Let me just say my best.

1476
02:22:33,060 --> 02:22:34,060
All right.

1477
02:22:34,060 --> 02:22:35,060
All right.

1478
02:22:35,060 --> 02:22:36,060
And then I do a little.

1479
02:22:38,060 --> 02:22:39,060
That works.

1480
02:22:42,060 --> 02:22:43,060
Oh, my God.

1481
02:22:48,060 --> 02:22:50,060
Not good with this one to be honest.

1482
02:22:54,060 --> 02:22:57,060
Playing full activate.

1483
02:22:59,060 --> 02:23:00,060
Wow.

1484
02:23:00,060 --> 02:23:01,060
It's off air.

1485
02:23:04,060 --> 02:23:05,060
Yeah, sure.

1486
02:23:08,060 --> 02:23:09,060
All right.

1487
02:23:10,060 --> 02:23:11,060
All right, BT.

1488
02:23:11,060 --> 02:23:12,060
Let's go.

1489
02:23:14,060 --> 02:23:15,060
Bitch.

1490
02:23:16,060 --> 02:23:17,060
I see you.

1491
02:23:17,060 --> 02:23:18,060
Where are you?

1492
02:23:18,060 --> 02:23:19,060
Come here.

1493
02:23:22,060 --> 02:23:23,060
Punch, punch, punch, punch.

1494
02:23:23,060 --> 02:23:24,060
Don't hide.

1495
02:23:24,060 --> 02:23:25,060
Don't hide.

1496
02:23:25,060 --> 02:23:26,060
Don't hide.

1497
02:23:26,060 --> 02:23:27,060
It only makes it harder for you.

1498
02:23:34,060 --> 02:23:37,060
I'm scratching my armpit.

1499
02:23:37,060 --> 02:23:39,060
Brute rocket launcher.

1500
02:23:39,060 --> 02:23:40,060

1501
02:23:41,060 --> 02:23:44,060
Although I do like Scorch for crowd control.

1502
02:23:44,060 --> 02:23:46,060
Offers a shortcut through the facility.

1503
02:23:46,060 --> 02:23:48,060
Check your heart for the control panel.

1504
02:23:48,060 --> 02:23:50,060
Check your heart for the control panel.

1505
02:23:53,060 --> 02:23:56,060
Attemptation to throw myself off was very great there.

1506

03:21:22,740 --> 03:21:24,740
I

1873
03:21:26,620 --> 03:21:28,620
Think

1874
03:21:29,180 --> 03:21:35,700
She's a robot. Why did it pull out and blood gushed everywhere pilot the security locked up. She's the apper like me. I

1876
03:21:39,980 --> 03:21:43,180
That shouldn't have that shouldn't have taken three tries. I should have taken like one

1877
03:21:48,100 --> 03:21:50,100
We should take no further shortcuts

1878
03:21:50,540 --> 03:21:56,220
No fucking shit, bro. Oh, I know my girlfriend

1879

Getting chonk for the winter

1887
03:23:50,100 --> 03:23:52,100
I

1888
03:23:53,820 --> 03:23:56,820
Glad robots are programmed to scream in fear

1889
03:24:00,620 --> 03:24:02,620
Now I can use a sword

1890
03:24:05,180 --> 03:24:11,180
Ronan class is pretty cool. No, I pretty cool and he's bulking

1891
03:24:13,580 --> 03:24:15,580
Boomi does not need to bulk

1892
03:24:21,100 --> 03:24:23,100
I

1893
03:24:30,260 --> 03:24:32,260
Eat this now

1894
03:24:37,100 --> 03:24:39,540
All this locking in has taken a lot out of me

1895
03:24:39,540 --> 03:24:41,540
I

1896
03:24:47,180 --> 03:24:52,900
Co-chat froze like a century ago booming go away

You

1899
03:25:08,820 --> 03:25:10,820
Again Gio Titanfall 2

1900
03:25:14,020 --> 03:25:16,020
By completing in one stream

1901
03:25:17,580 --> 03:25:21,220
Yeah, isn't it like four hours or something six hours I can do that one stream

1902
03:25:28,820 --> 03:25:33,260
I can't give him a little it's a cookie. He will die

1903
03:25:33,860 --> 03:25:41,820
Anonymous tipped four dollars and 20 cents. I wanted to thank you for showing me with chocolate. I just 100% edit

Need like another pillow for my back. Oh

His chocolate bad for cat. Did you not know that? Did you not know that chocolate is bad for cats?

1908
03:26:20,660 --> 03:26:22,660
That is extremely concerning

1909
03:26:26,620 --> 03:26:28,620
How my thumb hurts so bad

1910
03:26:29,540 --> 03:26:31,540
I

1911
03:26:32,100 --> 03:26:34,100
Was extremely concerning

1912
03:26:35,220 --> 03:26:38,940
You know my greenie. He has greenies. I am a greenie yesterday

1913
03:26:41,220 --> 03:26:43,220
And he another pillow

1914
03:26:58,980 --> 03:27:00,980
Oh

1915
03:27:02,740 --> 03:27:07,300
Let's do this. Oh, I am triple triple pillowing it up

1916
03:27:09,540 --> 03:27:15,700
I can't sit. Oh my god, I almost fell over. Oh, that's some good stuff, buddy

1917
03:27:19,460 --> 03:27:21,460
Madam he hungers

1918
03:27:21,780 --> 03:27:24,260
Did you know if you give your mouse a cookie?

1919
03:27:25,220 --> 03:27:29,220
I want some milk to go with it. Really? Did not know this

1920
03:27:33,780 --> 03:27:39,140
Yeah, that's and also grapes grapes are very poisonous to dogs as well people don't know that

1921
03:27:45,940 --> 03:27:52,660
Emerald I have my my my catpaw pillow that I'm sitting on which has I think just I've had it for a couple of years

1922
03:27:52,740 --> 03:27:58,740
and it's just like flattened now for my fucking fat ass and um, I just got my

1923
03:28:00,260 --> 03:28:02,260
Orthopedic pillow that I use for my neck

1924
03:28:03,300 --> 03:28:05,300
for my back

1925
03:28:05,300 --> 03:28:08,020
Just like that. What is I think I'm wearing my headphones wrong

1926
03:28:08,980 --> 03:28:10,980
There we go

1927
03:28:12,020 --> 03:28:14,020
Am I

1928
03:28:16,180 --> 03:28:19,300
And then I have another pillow for my head so I can sit up

1929
03:28:23,540 --> 03:28:27,780
Their punch kit big and they fly into the sky like a balloon

1930
03:28:29,060 --> 03:28:31,060
The thing is I wish I could put my feet up

1931
03:28:31,620 --> 03:28:34,820
But I can't because there's just a wall and my legs are long

1932
03:28:37,620 --> 03:28:40,580
If I was like four feet tall that'd be perfect

1933
03:28:47,380 --> 03:28:49,380
Major Anderson

1934
03:28:52,660 --> 03:28:59,940
Don't get fucking captured bro. I will avoid all shortcuts. Oh, I forgot about this where I fucking like

1935
03:29:04,900 --> 03:29:10,180
Where I go like fucking that's so raven into the past right over the fuck

1936
03:29:14,740 --> 03:29:17,140
Hey, am I shorter than you?

1937
03:29:17,300 --> 03:29:19,300
Oh

1938
03:29:19,620 --> 03:29:24,900
What just happened there are distortions throughout this facility and they appear to be causing a rift

1939
03:29:30,900 --> 03:29:32,900
Okay

1940
03:29:33,060 --> 03:29:40,580
No, well, this is awkward. So where do I go? Oh, there's a fucking hole in the wall. That's that's of course where I go

1941
03:29:47,300 --> 03:29:56,900
This looks like a like one of the dudes is from Elden ring one of the aristocrats

1942
03:29:58,660 --> 03:30:00,660
No, not the aristocrats just like

1943
03:30:00,660 --> 03:30:02,660
There we go

1944
03:30:13,620 --> 03:30:15,620
It fucking excuse me

1945
03:30:18,420 --> 03:30:20,420
Why do I see

1946
03:30:21,460 --> 03:30:23,460
Is that bt

1947
03:30:24,740 --> 03:30:27,700
Why does it say show bt over there, but it's not true

1948
03:30:28,580 --> 03:30:33,620
What is this place? Where am I? Oh, do I jump out? Oh, okay

1949
03:30:35,780 --> 03:30:38,980
This looks like a destiny. Can I have a better gun?

1950
03:30:51,860 --> 03:30:56,340
Strange I'm picking up traces of my own data signature within this area

1951
03:30:57,700 --> 03:31:00,260
This must be affecting my scans. He's dead

1952
03:31:01,140 --> 03:31:07,460
A lot of people are dead here. None of these remains. Smash the genetic profile of major Anderson. He'll still be alive

1953
03:31:10,500 --> 03:31:17,060
Can I recommend you check the main lobby perception? I would accompany you, but unfortunately my chassis will not fit

1954
03:31:17,060 --> 03:31:19,060
My chassis

1955
03:31:19,780 --> 03:31:21,780
Oh lucky you

1956
03:31:21,940 --> 03:31:23,940
I detect sarcasm

1957
03:31:24,740 --> 03:31:26,740
I detect sarcasm

1958
03:31:27,700 --> 03:31:29,700
Oh

1959
03:31:29,780 --> 03:31:31,780
Not a funny crowd fucking mile away

1960
03:31:32,180 --> 03:31:33,940
uh

1961
03:31:33,940 --> 03:31:35,940
Oh, how's the

1962
03:31:36,740 --> 03:31:38,740
don't

1963
03:31:39,220 --> 03:31:43,060
Quite understand how that happened to you, but

1964
03:31:47,060 --> 03:31:49,060
She's dead

1965
03:31:52,660 --> 03:31:54,660
Could I

1966
03:31:55,380 --> 03:31:57,380
Oh

1967
03:31:57,780 --> 03:32:03,460
I can't see their face at all. Oh his I thought it was a girl that was talking before

1968
03:32:04,500 --> 03:32:06,500
Okay

1969
03:32:10,180 --> 03:32:12,180
Gorgeous

1970
03:32:13,620 --> 03:32:15,620
I'm right here here

1971
03:32:16,340 --> 03:32:19,460
Here take it. Oh fuck. I didn't mean to do that here

1972
03:32:20,580 --> 03:32:22,340
Here

1973
03:32:22,340 --> 03:32:24,340
What the hell

1974
03:32:25,620 --> 03:32:27,620
Command of special operation 217

1975
03:32:28,020 --> 03:32:30,020
You know

1976
03:32:30,340 --> 03:32:34,020
Congratulations on your field promotion while in kubernetes. Oh my god

1977
03:32:34,260 --> 03:32:40,180
Anderson's mission briefing from commander sarah brings a polish a srs. Hey major anderson

1978
03:32:40,740 --> 03:32:44,740
Two weeks ago. We intercepted imc comms. I feel like I should do something about that

1979
03:32:45,460 --> 03:32:51,300
A massive blast of energy was discharged at this location creating time distortion. I'm gonna stay in the same spot. I'm so short

1980
03:32:52,100 --> 03:32:53,780
I'm a short king

1981
03:32:53,780 --> 03:32:55,060
Roger that

1982
03:32:55,060 --> 03:32:59,940
I'll get some answers this wrist mounted device. We recover during operation grizzly should protect you

1983
03:33:00,420 --> 03:33:05,300
We know the imc have contracted cuban blisk and his mercenaries to protect something critical there

1984
03:33:05,700 --> 03:33:07,220
So watch it back

1985
03:33:07,220 --> 03:33:11,460
And anderson, you know how much I love writing death reports. So don't go along

1986
03:33:12,180 --> 03:33:14,180
The srs is a team

1987
03:33:16,660 --> 03:33:17,940
Oh

1988
03:33:17,940 --> 03:33:19,940
I have no idea what they were talking about

1989
03:33:20,740 --> 03:33:28,500
We are duty bound to uphold and fulfill special operation 217. We do recommend. We locate anderson's wrist mounted device before proceeding

1990
03:33:29,060 --> 03:33:31,060
Okay

1991
03:33:31,460 --> 03:33:36,660
I didn't see any device on anderson. It must be on the other half of his corpse. How do you know?

1992
03:33:36,740 --> 03:33:41,460
Oh, you probably look through my head to the security services building. I will provide access

1993
03:33:41,780 --> 03:33:43,780
Okay

1994
03:33:44,100 --> 03:33:48,180
I will remain here and scan the ring structure while you investigate the facility

1995
03:33:49,140 --> 03:33:51,140
You could just lift me up there

1996
03:33:58,580 --> 03:34:00,420
That was

1997
03:34:00,420 --> 03:34:02,660
I won't lie bt. That was pretty fucking cool

1998
03:34:03,540 --> 03:34:04,740
Uh

1999
03:34:04,740 --> 03:34:10,180
That was pretty gnarly dude. I don't remember this at all this part. I always never remember the latter half of games

2000
03:34:11,700 --> 03:34:13,700
Oh

2001
03:34:14,420 --> 03:34:16,420
Is

2002
03:34:22,660 --> 03:34:24,660
Why

2003
03:34:29,700 --> 03:34:35,460
Oh, one of them's so alive. Oh spooky. Oh, there's a couple so alive. Oh

2004
03:34:39,220 --> 03:34:41,220
All right

2005
03:34:44,420 --> 03:34:47,220
Am I supposed to run past them? I feel like I am

2006
03:34:51,620 --> 03:34:53,620
No

2007
03:34:57,140 --> 03:34:59,140
No, there I am

2008
03:35:08,420 --> 03:35:10,420
You're right

2009
03:35:13,700 --> 03:35:15,700
I

2010
03:35:17,300 --> 03:35:20,580
Just look at fucking bt. Just chilling out with this little fucking chickens

2011
03:35:23,940 --> 03:35:26,580
No, sorry, I have to kill you in a mirage

2012
03:35:34,260 --> 03:35:36,260
This is very weird

2013
03:35:38,020 --> 03:35:42,660
I don't remember this at all. Oh the giant orbiverse spiders out my window again

2014
03:35:44,660 --> 03:35:46,660
Is it sexy robots?

2015
03:35:47,700 --> 03:35:51,220
The dev team's community manager. Oh really cool

2016
03:35:53,540 --> 03:35:56,660
I agree. I agree that she likes something's missing from game

2017
03:35:57,940 --> 03:36:00,260
Thank you for showing me his buddhisi

2018
03:36:02,660 --> 03:36:04,660
There we go

2019
03:36:04,980 --> 03:36:06,980
Thanks

2020
03:36:07,700 --> 03:36:09,700
Mr. Anderson

2021
03:36:09,940 --> 03:36:11,940
Damn his ass jiggled

2022
03:36:12,580 --> 03:36:14,980
How the fuck did this happen to him?

2023
03:36:17,940 --> 03:36:19,940
Why do I look like a fucking

2024
03:36:21,060 --> 03:36:24,100
pressed mouse wheel to time travel

2025
03:36:26,740 --> 03:36:28,740
All right

2026
03:36:35,780 --> 03:36:37,780
I'm I'm a little lost too

2027
03:36:42,260 --> 03:36:47,700
Now like I can just like snap out. Wait, will they still be over there? Oh, they are

2028
03:36:52,980 --> 03:36:54,980
Additional laser meshes are online

2029
03:37:04,820 --> 03:37:06,820
Oh

2030
03:37:12,660 --> 03:37:14,660
Good

2031
03:37:24,260 --> 03:37:26,260
Oh my god

2032
03:37:27,940 --> 03:37:29,940
I got a robot's just fucking chilling

2033
03:37:36,660 --> 03:37:40,260
Sorry, oh it kind of shows where they were

2034
03:37:42,740 --> 03:37:47,060
Nope, no, thanks. No, thank you

2035
03:37:49,620 --> 03:37:51,620
Yeah, I'm good with that

2036
03:37:55,860 --> 03:37:57,860
Wow

2037
03:37:59,940 --> 03:38:05,780
Am I supposed to be in here? Oh, I don't think so. All right, let's just let's just hide in here for a moment

2038
03:38:06,740 --> 03:38:08,740
I

2039
03:38:10,740 --> 03:38:13,940
What the fuck is happening up there

2040
03:38:17,540 --> 03:38:19,540
I'm terrified. I'm not playing fucking

2041
03:38:22,820 --> 03:38:24,820
Alien what's what is this?

2042
03:38:27,860 --> 03:38:29,860
Everybody's supposed to go

2043
03:38:36,180 --> 03:38:38,180
Oh

2044
03:38:39,620 --> 03:38:43,460
I would honestly right to fight these things people. Oh, no, I wouldn't

2045
03:38:53,220 --> 03:38:55,220
What oh

2046
03:38:56,180 --> 03:38:58,180
I

2047
03:39:05,140 --> 03:39:07,140
So I'm just casually time traveling

2048
03:39:21,460 --> 03:39:23,460
Oh, there's a fucking helmet there

2049
03:39:23,700 --> 03:39:25,700
Yeah, why not

2050
03:39:29,460 --> 03:39:31,460
Six no

2051
03:39:31,780 --> 03:39:42,660
We're going forward with this the test must be completed

2052
03:39:44,660 --> 03:39:50,340
Pilot a fragment of Anderson's damaged log may be relevant here activating log playback

2053
03:39:52,900 --> 03:39:55,860
Whoa found something. All right. Oh shit

2054
03:39:55,860 --> 03:40:03,940
Old space and time issues. I didn't build it, but they're restoring it. It was the engineers from alien

2055
03:40:09,140 --> 03:40:11,140
What

2056
03:40:18,020 --> 03:40:20,020
Oh somebody right here

2057
03:40:26,740 --> 03:40:28,740
Oh

2058
03:40:31,620 --> 03:40:37,220
It's actually kind of just easier to fight these guys and crazy robot dudes actually

2059
03:40:38,260 --> 03:40:39,140
Oh

2060
03:40:39,140 --> 03:40:41,140
Yep, precisely. No, thanks

2061
03:40:41,700 --> 03:40:45,460
I'm good with that. No, this is where I came from, wasn't it? What the fuck?

2062
03:40:48,500 --> 03:40:51,220
I'm so stupid this way

2063
03:40:52,180 --> 03:40:56,100
If we don't cast the arch power now, we may never

2064
03:41:05,620 --> 03:41:07,620
Are you guys doing down there?

2065
03:41:16,340 --> 03:41:18,340
That's actually kind of cool

2066
03:41:21,300 --> 03:41:23,300
Ow

2067
03:41:27,700 --> 03:41:33,060
Remember in the space jockey went on a killing rampage on humans because it killed Jesus who was one of them

2068
03:41:34,500 --> 03:41:36,500
Is that the thing?

2069
03:41:40,740 --> 03:41:42,740
Okay, I'm gonna get behind them

2070
03:41:51,220 --> 03:41:53,220
I

2071
03:41:54,740 --> 03:42:01,220
You know confirming the kill as one does uh pretty nice. We love it

2072
03:42:10,900 --> 03:42:19,060
Anderson's log 342 the full weapons power source is called the arc destiny wishes they could get on this level

2073
03:42:22,180 --> 03:42:24,340
Doesn't look like they perfected the casing

2074
03:42:28,180 --> 03:42:32,900
This one's empty the arc must be somewhere else Anderson out

2075
03:42:34,500 --> 03:42:40,500
I haven't watched Peretius in such a long time. No, I'm good. I'm good with that

2076
03:42:47,140 --> 03:42:49,140
Oh

2077
03:42:50,100 --> 03:42:52,100
Oh

2078
03:43:00,420 --> 03:43:06,180
Just keep running just keep running just keep running running running

2079
03:43:08,020 --> 03:43:10,020
What do you do just run

2080
03:43:15,620 --> 03:43:17,620
Ow

2081
03:43:19,140 --> 03:43:21,140
Oh

2082
03:43:40,100 --> 03:43:42,260
Must be so weird to see a dude just like

2083
03:43:44,580 --> 03:43:46,580
Disappearing and appearing randomly

2084
03:43:47,540 --> 03:43:49,540
Now

2085
03:43:50,420 --> 03:43:54,580
Oh god, there's so many. Oh, I didn't mean to miss that

2086
03:44:12,580 --> 03:44:14,580
I jumped into that

2087
03:44:17,460 --> 03:44:22,740
You can play that game. Give me a break. Give me a break. Let me get my health back up

2088
03:44:24,980 --> 03:44:29,380
Handlock. Oh, yeah, handlock. Oh, oh

2089
03:44:36,820 --> 03:44:38,820
Um, where am I supposed to go?

2090
03:44:39,380 --> 03:44:41,380
Oh

2091
03:44:46,260 --> 03:44:48,260
I see

2092
03:45:06,180 --> 03:45:08,180
I can't really go

2093
03:45:09,620 --> 03:45:11,620
What am I doing?

2094
03:45:16,100 --> 03:45:18,100
Oh, hey

2095
03:45:20,020 --> 03:45:22,580
Wait, oh, what the fuck

2096
03:45:30,020 --> 03:45:32,020
All right, looks like it wants me to do this

2097
03:45:39,140 --> 03:45:41,860
I'll successfully deliver to both. Yeah, yo

2098
03:45:43,940 --> 03:45:49,860
Pilot the rings at my location contain a large amount of residual energy. This was the arc's final destination

2099
03:45:50,340 --> 03:45:52,340
Anderson's plan. Yo

2100
03:45:52,660 --> 03:45:58,500
Within close proximity to the center of the active rings. Sorry. I'm just like enjoying this story because I don't remember this

2101
03:46:00,980 --> 03:46:06,420
I'm pressing the wrong button. You sure I'll be safe over there. No, but a true militia pilot takes risks

2102
03:46:06,420 --> 03:46:09,220
It's that's me taking ideas from apex

2103
03:46:23,140 --> 03:46:25,140
Damn, that's hard

2104
03:46:31,220 --> 03:46:33,540
No, he's right though, he's right

2105
03:46:34,180 --> 03:46:39,300
Hey, timefall did steal so much from apex bro. Oh

2106
03:46:44,260 --> 03:46:47,780
They're really thinking that I'm good at this

2107
03:46:50,020 --> 03:46:54,660
Dr. Jefferson boil double tape looks like they went forward with the arc test

2108
03:46:55,300 --> 03:47:01,300
Despite my warnings to postpone, but what martyr wants martyr gets. I don't know how I survived, but I did

2109
03:47:02,260 --> 03:47:04,260
For now

2110
03:47:07,780 --> 03:47:09,780
Oh

2111
03:47:11,860 --> 03:47:19,780
I'm so sorry. I like archaeology. Oh, it'd be funny if you just fucking showed up like what the fuck

2112
03:47:23,860 --> 03:47:28,180
Uh, where the fuck am I supposed to go? Oh, I see

2113
03:47:28,180 --> 03:47:30,180
Okay

2114
03:47:38,500 --> 03:47:40,500
Oh

2115
03:47:43,220 --> 03:47:45,220
Uh

2116
03:47:46,500 --> 03:47:49,700
No timefall timefall totally ripped off apex bro

2117
03:47:49,700 --> 03:47:54,740
Like look at all the same the guns are the same like could they get less original like they couldn't come up their own guns

2118
03:47:54,820 --> 03:47:56,820
Like are you serious bro?

2119
03:47:58,980 --> 03:48:00,980
Oh

2120
03:48:04,260 --> 03:48:06,260
Now

2121
03:48:07,220 --> 03:48:11,540
They were targeting this planet's moving test this damn thing was just a test

2122
03:48:12,100 --> 03:48:14,100
Game is this timefall

2123
03:48:14,100 --> 03:48:19,140
They're going to hit hard and fall to you and they moved up the timeline. I have to get this intel to sarah

2124
03:48:21,220 --> 03:48:23,220
Oh, I still don't know what's happening

2125
03:48:23,220 --> 03:48:25,220
Oh

2126
03:48:26,660 --> 03:48:31,700
Exactly jokie exact what the fuck I gotta save him in the past

2127
03:48:34,100 --> 03:48:36,100
I can't

2128
03:48:36,740 --> 03:48:38,740
Get him

2129
03:48:42,580 --> 03:48:45,220
That was major anderson's final recording. Oh

2130
03:48:45,780 --> 03:48:50,420
Cooper based on your recon of this facility. I may have a plan. Meet me outside

2131
03:48:50,740 --> 03:48:54,020
Oh, meet me outside. How about that?

2132
03:48:57,140 --> 03:48:59,140
Am I supposed to fucking jump through that? Oh

2133
03:49:04,660 --> 03:49:06,660
Oh interesting

2134
03:49:10,740 --> 03:49:14,420
I would like to spend some time today to talk about the value of human life

2135
03:49:14,820 --> 03:49:16,900
Why is there always a dead body next to one?

2136
03:49:17,060 --> 03:49:20,180
No value to human life because I don't think you just died here

2137
03:49:34,100 --> 03:49:36,100
Oh

2138
03:49:39,460 --> 03:49:42,340
Ha ha get fucking jorked

2139
03:49:42,740 --> 03:49:44,740
Oh

2140
03:49:48,900 --> 03:49:50,900
Okay

2141
03:49:52,900 --> 03:49:56,100
Okay, she be I can smell the sarcasm from here

2142
03:49:57,780 --> 03:49:59,780
What no i'm not being sarcastic

2143
03:50:01,620 --> 03:50:05,220
Who has the opportunity to run by a best hole have a guy at pause and ask wait

2144
03:50:05,380 --> 03:50:08,580
Is there self-shelf vision this it'll be fine and time travel

2145
03:50:08,580 --> 03:50:24,100
I don't know why that's so funny to me. It's like they couldn't yeah, they could have definitely did like some stupid fucking gag

2146
03:50:30,100 --> 03:50:32,260
I recommend you meet me at the rings in order to

2147
03:50:32,260 --> 03:50:34,260
What the fuck

2148
03:50:37,540 --> 03:50:39,540
Hey big boy, oh

2149
03:50:40,900 --> 03:50:44,260
Sorry, sorry that was loud

2150
03:51:03,220 --> 03:51:08,100
It's hard to get it past those shields. Oh, no, no time travel fuck

2151
03:51:10,500 --> 03:51:13,220
Flank enemies to oh, yeah, I fucking know that

2152
03:51:18,500 --> 03:51:21,000
Pilot pilot

2153
03:51:32,820 --> 03:51:34,820
Oh

2154
03:51:50,660 --> 03:51:55,860
Is there a fucking puppy in there? Oh, thank you. I appreciate it Rob

2155
03:51:56,580 --> 03:51:58,580
Anything you meet me at the rings

2156
03:52:00,660 --> 03:52:02,660
Oh 360 no

2157
03:52:10,020 --> 03:52:12,020
Yeah, I'm not allowed to come over here

2158
03:52:12,260 --> 03:52:14,260
Oh

2159
03:52:24,660 --> 03:52:26,660
I'm sitting on fucking fire

2160
03:52:30,660 --> 03:52:32,660
Like there's puppies behind the door

2161
03:52:32,900 --> 03:52:34,900
Oh

2162
03:52:40,340 --> 03:52:42,340
They leave

2163
03:52:52,260 --> 03:52:54,260
No, fuck I can't cloak I can only

2164
03:53:02,660 --> 03:53:04,660
Oh

2165
03:53:16,420 --> 03:53:18,420
It takes a whole fucking clip

2166
03:53:33,620 --> 03:53:42,180
Hold on I'm just scratching like why are you where are you going? All right

2167
03:53:46,980 --> 03:53:48,980
I'm a true gamer now

2168
03:53:51,780 --> 03:53:53,780
Sorry, I'm taking the elevator. Let's take me a bit

2169
03:54:03,380 --> 03:54:05,380
You

2170
03:54:13,620 --> 03:54:15,620
Don't fucking run away from me

2171
03:54:18,420 --> 03:54:22,420
Motherfucker anyways

2172
03:54:25,220 --> 03:54:28,900
Pilot I've located the controls to extend the bridge to the rings. Yeah

2173
03:54:28,900 --> 03:54:30,900
Marked it on your head

2174
03:54:32,100 --> 03:54:34,820
BT you didn't fucking tell me there are puppies around

2175
03:54:35,300 --> 03:54:42,900
It appears that whatever actions you took in the past have caused the remaining automated security systems to be quite hostile towards us. Yeah

2176
03:54:45,940 --> 03:54:48,340
Do you want me to embark I don't uh, let's embark

2177
03:54:55,060 --> 03:54:58,100
Actually BT it would have been probably easier if you were doing your own thing

2178
03:54:58,900 --> 03:55:00,900
Another I think of it

2179
03:55:06,740 --> 03:55:08,740
I can time travel with BT

2180
03:55:12,900 --> 03:55:14,900
All right

2181
03:55:16,820 --> 03:55:18,820
Oh

2182
03:55:28,900 --> 03:55:34,980
I have marked the bridge controls on your HUD you will need to extend the bridge before the fold web and test pad explodes

2183
03:55:38,500 --> 03:55:40,980
Sorry I'm gonna just get behind them

2184
03:55:43,380 --> 03:55:45,380
Before the one explodes

2185
03:55:47,780 --> 03:55:51,380
I'll be fucking terrified that there's a Titan teleporting around me. I'm not gonna lie to you

2186
03:55:59,700 --> 03:56:03,220
I hate that I'm killing people in the past. They weren't you honestly didn't really do anything

2187
03:56:06,660 --> 03:56:08,660
I don't know why I need that

2188
03:56:19,220 --> 03:56:22,260
Extend the bridge oh what that

2189
03:56:29,860 --> 03:56:31,860
I don't think I can get up there

2190
03:56:33,940 --> 03:56:35,940
Am I supposed to do oh

2191
03:56:37,220 --> 03:56:39,220
Excuse me BT. I just need to

2192
03:56:42,020 --> 03:56:44,020
You you keep sitting pretty there

2193
03:56:48,820 --> 03:56:50,820
Oh, I forgot about the cool hacky knives

2194
03:56:51,780 --> 03:56:53,780
Any circumstances

2195
03:56:56,820 --> 03:57:01,700
I like how I'm randomly doing this now it's kind of weird how like we just switch what we're doing

2196
03:57:02,500 --> 03:57:04,500
BT where the fuck did you go? Oh?

2197
03:57:09,460 --> 03:57:11,460
Should we redo something

2198
03:57:21,780 --> 03:57:28,020
I feel like we should be leaving what am I doing scan the arc

2199
03:57:34,980 --> 03:57:37,620
Something tells me the bridge is there back in time

2200
03:57:40,500 --> 03:57:43,460
And she goes Nia. Yeah, I bet she does

2201
03:57:43,620 --> 03:57:50,900
All right, BT. Let's look in

2202
03:58:02,420 --> 03:58:04,420
Oh

2203
03:58:04,900 --> 03:58:09,060
And I Cooper breathing BT

2204
03:58:09,460 --> 03:58:11,460
I

2205
03:58:19,780 --> 03:58:21,780
Accidentally froze time this is awkward

2206
03:58:23,620 --> 03:58:33,220
Oh no now I'm gonna have to hop skip and jump through shit. Oh ride. Oh, that's fine. Actually. I prefer that. I hope there's a bunch of these

2207
03:58:33,620 --> 03:58:41,780
No, what's happening here? I'm tweaking

2208
03:58:49,780 --> 03:58:57,060
Okay, I'm pressing e am I too close. I'm sorry I had to flip around

2209
03:58:57,060 --> 03:58:59,060
Oh

2210
03:59:02,180 --> 03:59:04,180
Flashback

2211
03:59:05,860 --> 03:59:07,860
She comes your neck

2212
03:59:11,780 --> 03:59:17,060
It's gravity still operate that's a good point. That's a great question. Oh physics

2213
03:59:17,060 --> 03:59:19,060
Thanks

2214
03:59:22,900 --> 03:59:32,340
Well done pilot scan complete as thank you me the imc intend to destroy the militia planet of harmony using the full-scale version of this weapon

2215
03:59:33,060 --> 03:59:38,340
Damn, they're really like star wars up in here. Why is it raining? We must get this data to the fleet

2216
03:59:39,380 --> 03:59:40,580
All right

2217
03:59:40,580 --> 03:59:42,260
Oh, all right

2218
03:59:42,260 --> 03:59:43,860
I'm gone now

2219
03:59:43,860 --> 03:59:46,580
And you turn on a light it is dark in here

2220
03:59:48,020 --> 03:59:50,020
Okay, now I can see

2221
03:59:57,460 --> 03:59:59,700
Time stopped air would be like a wall of concrete

2222
04:00:00,580 --> 04:00:05,860
Really, that's a good point. It's a lot of like suspensions of disbelief we do when it comes to that sort of thing

2223
04:00:05,860 --> 04:00:07,860
Oh

2224
04:00:16,500 --> 04:00:22,500
Did I get up here Anderson is dead, but we can complete his mission if we can reestablish contact with the fleet

2225
04:00:22,820 --> 04:00:25,140
Why can't you jump when I'm inside you?

2226
04:00:26,820 --> 04:00:28,580
That sounds weird

2227
04:00:28,580 --> 04:00:34,580
Let's hope someone on our side is listening out there. There is only one way you're going so fucking fast

2228
04:00:34,660 --> 04:00:36,660
I'm just a little dude

2229
04:00:48,100 --> 04:00:52,260
You mean I can't be riding inside of you at this point. Are you are you shitting me?

2230
04:00:53,940 --> 04:00:55,940
What the fuck where are you going bt

2231
04:00:56,820 --> 04:01:02,420
Caution I'm picking up multiple contacts. All right. She's like stomping so angrily

2232
04:01:02,420 --> 04:01:11,300
Hostiles confirmed the stalkers appear to be programmed. Sorry. I'll I'll sand in your eyesight. So it looks more natural. Oh shit. That looks pretty sick

2233
04:01:14,820 --> 04:01:16,820
All right, let's do this dude. What's that?

2234
04:01:18,580 --> 04:01:20,580
bt come pick this up

2235
04:01:22,660 --> 04:01:24,660
bt

2236
04:01:25,140 --> 04:01:27,140
What is this fog?

2237
04:01:28,740 --> 04:01:32,020
The ground fog is a toxic byproduct of the beacon power grid

2238
04:01:32,980 --> 04:01:36,020
I recommend you embark when operating in hazardous and violence

2239
04:01:42,260 --> 04:01:48,580
Pilot I'm detecting militia forces inside that beacon control room. They are signaling distress patching in

2240
04:01:51,380 --> 04:01:54,340
Hey you out there pilot are you reading us?

2241
04:01:55,220 --> 04:02:00,260
We can use some help over here. This is captain Cole for the third militia credit here. I supposed to be walking

2242
04:02:02,820 --> 04:02:07,620
How's he not dying these stalkers and then make direct contact with the militia riflemen

2243
04:02:08,580 --> 04:02:10,580
That was fucking weird

2244
04:02:28,180 --> 04:02:30,180
This kind of isn't really working out

2245
04:02:30,260 --> 04:02:38,660
Tactical option run them over my 40 ton chassis can eliminate smaller enemies. Yeah, not robots that well though. I'm not gonna lie to you

2246
04:02:41,380 --> 04:02:45,220
Actually seems like it. Oh fuck it

2247
04:02:51,540 --> 04:02:56,660
What are you doing? Why does it take forever to kill you guys? Okay

2248
04:02:56,900 --> 04:03:06,500
Thread neutralized well done. This victory has raised our calm efficiency rating. No way, you know, it'd be funny

2249
04:03:11,860 --> 04:03:19,060
You saved our asses those stalkers just kept on coming we may not have lasted much longer. Yeah, I think you could have been fine

2250
04:03:21,460 --> 04:03:23,460
No, okay

2251
04:03:24,420 --> 04:03:26,420
I'm coming

2252
04:03:34,660 --> 04:03:36,660
Hey

2253
04:03:36,740 --> 04:03:39,780
I totally didn't let other teammates die before

2254
04:03:40,900 --> 04:03:44,180
What's up Cole? What is the status of the beacon?

2255
04:03:44,900 --> 04:03:46,660
The power is shut down

2256
04:03:46,660 --> 04:03:48,660
We've lost all control of beacon

2257
04:03:48,660 --> 04:03:54,020
Peacemaker or path find peacemaker pathfinder looks like a mini version of bt to be honest

2258
04:03:55,140 --> 04:03:58,900
I know he's like a like kind of like one of the robots in here that you like

2259
04:03:59,540 --> 04:04:03,060
This like kind of reworked, but you repair it. You good

2260
04:04:04,020 --> 04:04:06,020
Are they fucking

2261
04:04:07,140 --> 04:04:10,340
Who the fuck are you talking shit about this place just ain't built for humans

2262
04:04:11,220 --> 04:04:14,580
I feel like you guys are talking shit. You just gestured to me. Who are you?

2263
04:04:19,380 --> 04:04:21,380
Was a huge victory

2264
04:04:22,820 --> 04:04:26,980
Good luck, sir. I hope you make it back. We've lost too many down there. Well, the

2265
04:04:36,100 --> 04:04:39,060
All right later. I heard someone's been killing off blitzx team

2266
04:04:41,460 --> 04:04:44,420
Bye. Yeah, it's me. I'm him

2267
04:04:49,060 --> 04:04:55,140
Don't bite me. I'm just shooting guys. I'm just I'm just here. We just we should be ruined to and in shooting

2268
04:04:55,940 --> 04:04:57,700
space

2269
04:04:57,700 --> 04:05:00,340
All right, you ready? Are you ready sergeant russell?

2270
04:05:01,860 --> 04:05:03,860
You look a lot like sergeant kamata. Uh

2271
04:05:06,500 --> 04:05:11,780
I'm all these are stairs what stairs and this turtle up to protect their heads

2272
04:05:12,020 --> 04:05:14,020
Uh

2273

Thank you for the plot help sir. Can I can I

2274
04:05:21,300 --> 04:05:25,700
Oh, sorry, I thought I could go through time again. So last buddy booty booty booty rocking everywhere

2275
04:05:28,500 --> 04:05:30,500
All right

2276
04:05:34,660 --> 04:05:36,660
I'll figure away

2277
04:05:37,140 --> 04:05:41,140
To monitor your progress the channel is open if you need assistance. Thank you

2278
04:05:43,060 --> 04:05:45,060
What's up with these walls

2279
04:05:46,020 --> 04:05:52,260
Scanning exposed power circuits. You should avoid physical contact. Thank you very cool for the time gifted

2280
04:05:52,820 --> 04:05:58,500
Got it. Now you're playing with power. I feel like I really didn't even need to ask

2281
04:06:00,660 --> 04:06:02,660
Yeah

2282
04:06:02,660 --> 04:06:04,660
Uh

2283
04:06:06,020 --> 04:06:09,460
No kidding. I'm not gonna kill him. See look it's pathfinder

2284
04:06:14,020 --> 04:06:16,020
Where the hell am I going?

2285
04:06:17,460 --> 04:06:19,460
Oh, you want me to go this way

2286
04:06:20,740 --> 04:06:24,100
Go on after you show me the way

2287
04:06:32,900 --> 04:06:34,900
Oh

2288
04:06:35,460 --> 04:06:37,460
Yippie softball

2289
04:06:39,140 --> 04:06:41,140
What

2290
04:06:42,180 --> 04:06:44,180
Oh, but I like the double take

2291
04:06:46,820 --> 04:06:50,340
I like the double take because I can probably

2292
04:06:51,380 --> 04:06:53,380
night people. Yeah

2293
04:06:54,660 --> 04:06:56,660
Yeah

2294
04:07:02,740 --> 04:07:06,500
Oh, see this will be helpful. Ah Marvin do something

2295
04:07:13,380 --> 04:07:15,380
I have 24 shots

2296
04:07:17,460 --> 04:07:19,460
And I did not need it

2297
04:07:23,380 --> 04:07:25,380
I

2298
04:07:25,940 --> 04:07:31,220
Explode oh i'm in a corner. I'm scared. I like how they're just doing their own fucking thing

2299
04:07:33,620 --> 04:07:35,620
You guys got

2300
04:07:38,340 --> 04:07:40,340
Wait, hold on let me 360

2301
04:07:45,220 --> 04:07:47,220

See you guys see that

2303
04:07:54,900 --> 04:07:57,860
You guys see that that was pretty sick

2304
04:07:59,060 --> 04:08:01,060
That was pretty sick

2305
04:08:01,300 --> 04:08:03,300
I'm gonna say

2306
04:08:04,580 --> 04:08:10,260
Oh, I'm gonna say that was pretty sick. That's all I'm gonna say

2307
04:08:12,900 --> 04:08:20,900
Uh, I think I should probably collab with vsbo vispo. I call them vispo vispo in vispo yin

2308
04:08:25,060 --> 04:08:28,500
Oh, don't touch the floor it's lava

2309

Okay

This isn't not why would the devs do this like the marvins are like little like pets

2341
04:11:56,900 --> 04:12:00,260
Why can't I jump I don't understand why I can't make that

2342
04:12:04,260 --> 04:12:06,260
It's very warm in here

04:12:48,100 --> 04:12:53,460
Like how it recognizes and waits till I'm there, uh, I'm assuming I do this one

2347
04:12:59,620 --> 04:13:01,620
Yippie

2348

Well, oh check point

Oh

2352
04:13:28,500 --> 04:13:35,460
Please don't go out that would suck if this was timed. I'm happy. It's not I'm happy. They're a little bit more

2353
04:13:38,740 --> 04:13:40,740
They just wait for you to leave

2354
04:13:41,620 --> 04:13:43,940
Oh, I didn't see you there

04:13:46,020 --> 04:13:49,140

04:13:54,260 --> 04:13:56,260
Are you what the fuck was that?

04:14:03,460 --> 04:14:09,620
All right, I like that I didn't scope in because my mouse my right click is broken and my front click is broken

2360
04:14:11,380 --> 04:14:13,380

Yep

2367
04:14:47,460 --> 04:14:53,060

No, watch out. No. Oh, okay. They stay off cool

2373
04:15:22,020 --> 04:15:24,020

Was it impressive me dying several times? I'm happy you thought that was nice

2375
04:15:29,540 --> 04:15:33,860
Uh, do you guys have better guns? I would like to reload my flat line

2376
04:15:33,860 --> 04:15:38,020
I don't want that gun nothing. I don't like it

2377
04:15:40,980 --> 04:15:42,980
What are you doing he's got the arc tool

2378
04:15:43,860 --> 04:15:48,740
That's impressive. I just took it off of a guy. I don't I don't think it's that impressive

2379
04:15:52,420 --> 04:15:58,740
Why are you guys gassing me up when I literally just started this job? What's that massive some amazing moves, sir auto loading shotgun

Actually

2382
04:16:05,060 --> 04:16:07,060
How about I like the double take

2383
04:16:07,940 --> 04:16:09,940

2389
04:16:42,020 --> 04:16:44,020
That's yours

2390
04:16:44,100 --> 04:16:46,340
Again, if you got uh, if you got gifted

2391
04:16:47,940 --> 04:16:49,940
Make sure you take re kuma

2392
04:16:52,900 --> 04:16:54,900
I love that pieces

2393
04:16:55,700 --> 04:17:05,700
This is great. I'm having a great time now if only there were real people I would feel a little bit more validated

2394
04:17:06,420 --> 04:17:10,500
Good work pilot cover now we can jump start the power to get the beacon functional

2395
04:17:12,420 --> 04:17:15,700
That was a mildly suggestive bt damn. Oh my

2396
04:17:18,980 --> 04:17:20,980
Is there

2397
04:17:21,300 --> 04:17:24,820
Rule 34 of you the arc tool should be able to jump start

2398
04:17:24,900 --> 04:17:26,900
the manually

2399
04:17:27,620 --> 04:17:30,980
Let's hope that our tool was worth all the trouble that pilot better be careful

2400
04:17:34,260 --> 04:17:40,500
Open the fucking door shut up bro. You're not doing it high radiation levels detected ahead

2401
04:17:40,980 --> 04:17:46,180
Your suit will only protect you for a limited time inside the chamber. I suggest you move quickly

2402
04:17:46,660 --> 04:17:49,700
I wouldn't stay in there too long unless you want to be burnt to a crisp

2403
04:17:50,340 --> 04:17:52,340
You just mess this the case

2404
04:17:53,300 --> 04:17:55,300
You mean the whole world

2405
04:17:59,700 --> 04:18:02,200
Oh, this is what I'm supposed to be doing

2406
04:18:13,060 --> 04:18:15,060
Am I dead

2407
04:18:16,980 --> 04:18:18,980
What am I missing

2408
04:18:23,220 --> 04:18:26,980
How I recommend you exit the chamber immediately

2409
04:18:27,940 --> 04:18:29,620
No

2410
04:18:29,620 --> 04:18:31,620
Great now I have cancer

2411
04:18:32,420 --> 04:18:34,420
All right, we got power

2412
04:18:35,060 --> 04:18:37,860
Come on you wouldn't come on you wouldn't

2413
04:18:38,980 --> 04:18:41,780
Diagnostic complete power 100 percent

2414
04:18:42,900 --> 04:18:47,460
Initiate discharging reset uplink targeting module reset initiated

2415
04:18:48,260 --> 04:18:50,660
Oh, sorry. Sorry. I forgot I wasn't alone

2416
04:18:52,340 --> 04:18:57,940
80 percent 90 percent come on. I got to be a youtuber sometimes. I was too wholesome yesterday in my stream

2417
04:19:04,020 --> 04:19:09,620
Yes, I've seen kung pao into the fist. I've seen clips of it from the stream. I got the imc or on their way

2418
04:19:09,940 --> 04:19:11,940
The ymca

2419
04:19:13,940 --> 04:19:20,420
Do you have a fucking sword? What is that? I feel like there's a lot of pointless stuff on your back

2420
04:19:20,580 --> 04:19:25,620
Pilot this situation could use your skills. I just got here. It's my first day

2421
04:19:26,660 --> 04:19:29,860
You'll need to repair the beacon on site. You're back here as fast as possible

2422
04:19:32,020 --> 04:19:35,860
Do you not feel strange right girls? No, all right, let's go bc

2423
04:19:37,780 --> 04:19:39,780
pilot control

2424
04:19:39,780 --> 04:19:41,780
I forgot what it looked like

2425
04:19:41,780 --> 04:19:44,100
We're in like just more like a normie outfit with them

2426
04:19:44,900 --> 04:19:47,940
With them thing on the helmet. Where am I going?

2427
04:19:48,740 --> 04:19:54,340
All right, be careful. We've already lost a lot of good soldiers over there. Well, they're not me sergeant. So

2428
04:19:55,380 --> 04:19:57,380
Sucks to suck

2429
04:19:58,020 --> 04:20:00,740
I am the main character of this video game. I'm the protagonist

2430
04:20:01,940 --> 04:20:08,420
My memory recalls this pilot as an exceptional fighter proven well during the fracture operation clearly not good enough

2431
04:20:09,620 --> 04:20:11,620
Sorry

2432
04:20:12,180 --> 04:20:18,100
Fracture with the coloring of a major combat refueling operation conducted by the militia on the plane in victor

2433
04:20:18,820 --> 04:20:21,860
We sustained many casualties, but the fleet survived

2434
04:20:23,220 --> 04:20:25,220
Oh my god, you fucking scared me bt

2435
04:20:28,340 --> 04:20:31,700
You're right bt is the main character. Can you hello?

2436
04:20:33,300 --> 04:20:36,180
My scans detect a functioning uplink targeting module

2437
04:20:36,420 --> 04:20:42,580
428 meters northeast my analysis indicates a throw is our only option here. I can

2438
04:20:46,580 --> 04:20:48,580
You're fucking kidding

2439
04:20:48,740 --> 04:20:50,740
I'm incapable of insanity pilot

2440
04:20:51,940 --> 04:20:56,180
Uh, hold on. Let me uh put a smaller gun out. It makes me feel better

2441
04:20:57,060 --> 04:21:01,300
Uh, I can't believe. Oh, I wasn't ready. Uh

2442
04:21:01,860 --> 04:21:03,860
Ah

2443
04:21:05,460 --> 04:21:11,620
Oh my god, 95 meters projectile mass no 89 kilograms. I'm listening that

2444
04:21:20,820 --> 04:21:22,820
Sorry how to do the rtd2 screen

2445
04:21:24,340 --> 04:21:26,340
Good throw

2446
04:21:26,340 --> 04:21:32,340
Welcome pilot. Good luck over there. Come on. He's daddy. Who the fuck are you? Why are you still here?

2447
04:21:33,860 --> 04:21:35,860
The damn pilot

2448
04:21:37,860 --> 04:21:39,860
This goat

2449
04:21:42,340 --> 04:21:44,340
Get to the beacon now

2450
04:21:44,340 --> 04:21:46,340
Find the client among the last beat me

2451
04:21:47,460 --> 04:21:49,460
The fuck am I doing

2452
04:21:56,900 --> 04:21:58,900
Think that that's what it wants me to do

2453
04:22:02,500 --> 04:22:06,180
Yep. Oh, yeah, because it has a little fucking red things here

2454
04:22:09,300 --> 04:22:10,900
Oh

2455
04:22:10,900 --> 04:22:15,140
I don't like that. I have to I wish I could just scroll through them and instead of clicking see

2456
04:22:15,140 --> 04:22:17,140
Ah

2457
04:22:29,700 --> 04:22:34,900
Oh, what the fuck I forgot what gun I had it's a good one

2458
04:22:38,820 --> 04:22:40,820
Oh my god, fuck off

2459
04:22:40,900 --> 04:22:42,900
Oh

2460
04:22:49,620 --> 04:22:52,260
Oh, I miss you. Oh, you're a teammate. No, you're not

2461
04:22:53,540 --> 04:22:55,540
I'm

2462
04:22:57,140 --> 04:22:59,140
I'm gonna die

2463
04:22:59,140 --> 04:23:01,140
Oh

2464
04:23:25,620 --> 04:23:27,620
Actually, I'll take the hemlock

2465
04:23:28,020 --> 04:23:30,500
Just wanted a hug. That's way too bad

2466
04:23:32,740 --> 04:23:34,740
Get to the bacon. No

2467
04:23:36,900 --> 04:23:38,900
Who can I oh wait

2468
04:23:41,300 --> 04:23:46,340
Are you my friends now? Oh, fuck. Yeah, let's go

2469
04:23:49,700 --> 04:23:51,700
Yeah, I don't think you can make it over here. It's fine

2470
04:23:57,940 --> 04:24:00,820
Hmm, don't quite know what the point of that was

2471
04:24:05,860 --> 04:24:08,660
Hey, I forgot what gun I had

2472
04:24:15,620 --> 04:24:17,620
And I forgot to reload

2473
04:24:22,580 --> 04:24:24,580
Fuck

2474
04:24:28,180 --> 04:24:30,980
This is not it. Oh, perhaps it is

2475
04:24:40,260 --> 04:24:43,780
Oh my god, I can't even not even tracking you properly

2476
04:24:49,620 --> 04:24:51,620
Why

2477
04:24:52,100 --> 04:24:56,980
Sometimes I forget the later NPCs have a little bit more health. They don't have better AI

2478
04:24:57,860 --> 04:24:59,860
They just have a little bit more health

2479
04:25:02,740 --> 04:25:04,740
Hi, y'all

2480
04:25:05,940 --> 04:25:12,500
No, get the fuck out of here, bro. Get the fuck out of here. Oh, hey, Marvin

2481
04:25:15,620 --> 04:25:18,820
Okay, I didn't mean to do that. It's fine

2482
04:25:22,740 --> 04:25:26,500
Am I presuming I move this somewhere? Yes, okay

2483
04:25:28,580 --> 04:25:33,620
At least they can't jump like me. Oh, fuck. Don't fucking shoot me when I'm doing stuff

2484
04:25:41,780 --> 04:25:47,860
Can I reload? No, I can't. No, I was actually gonna have a full full clip

2485
04:25:50,740 --> 04:25:52,740
Look, they're all happy

2486
04:25:54,180 --> 04:25:56,180
At least these ones are happy

2487
04:25:58,500 --> 04:26:00,500
I

2488
04:26:00,900 --> 04:26:02,900
Where am I moving this to

2489
04:26:04,820 --> 04:26:06,820
This

2490
04:26:10,500 --> 04:26:14,820
I'm um, assuming so. Oh look a helmet

2491
04:26:16,580 --> 04:26:18,580
Oh

2492
04:26:18,660 --> 04:26:25,220
It's gonna be like one of fucking nine. I fucking knew it. Uh, I think that's a bit too far

2493
04:26:27,780 --> 04:26:29,780
So

2494
04:26:32,580 --> 04:26:37,380
Excuse me pardon and then we're gonna

2495
04:26:42,980 --> 04:26:44,980
No, you make that

2496
04:26:46,660 --> 04:26:48,660
Duma's so goofy. Yeah

2497
04:26:50,500 --> 04:26:52,500
Wait for your phone to charge

2498
04:26:53,380 --> 04:27:01,060
Yeah, I don't really know what I'm supposed to be doing here. I'll be honest with you because I don't know how I'm supposed to get over there

2499
04:27:04,420 --> 04:27:06,420
Am I supposed to move that one over there?

2500
04:27:08,740 --> 04:27:12,980
No, but then I'd have to go all the way back doesn't make that much sense

2501
04:27:13,780 --> 04:27:15,780
I

2502
04:27:17,540 --> 04:27:24,820
I'm a little confuzzled ladies and gentlemen. I'm not I'm not a puzzle person, you know not a puzzle person

2503
04:27:29,060 --> 04:27:32,260
All right, so let's move back here. Well, where am I going?

2504
04:27:34,500 --> 04:27:36,500
So that's fine

2505
04:27:43,700 --> 04:27:45,700
Can I make that? Oh

2506
04:27:47,780 --> 04:27:49,780
I see

2507
04:27:51,700 --> 04:27:55,940
Okay, I got it now buzzing go

2508
04:28:01,860 --> 04:28:09,160
Actually, I think I might have to die I think dying I think dying is necessary

2509
04:28:12,980 --> 04:28:14,980
I

2510
04:28:22,740 --> 04:28:24,740
Eh, maybe I'm doing this wrong

2511
04:28:36,500 --> 04:28:39,860
I just want I just want to see something I just want to see something I just want to see something

2512
04:28:43,060 --> 04:28:50,100
Fuck I didn't okay, and then move

2513
04:29:03,940 --> 04:29:07,540
What why are you guys looking at me like that? Is this not what I was supposed to do

2514
04:29:08,100 --> 04:29:14,900
What do you what do you mean madam, please?

2515
04:29:18,500 --> 04:29:20,500
What do you mean madam, please

2516
04:29:24,580 --> 04:29:26,580
Was that not

2517
04:29:29,940 --> 04:29:32,340
Was that not what I was supposed to do

2518
04:29:32,340 --> 04:29:34,340
Do

2519
04:29:37,220 --> 04:29:41,380
But not with the dying well, I don't know how else I would be able to do that to be honest

2520
04:29:43,540 --> 04:29:45,540
Because I couldn't

2521
04:29:46,260 --> 04:29:48,100
How am I

2522
04:29:48,100 --> 04:29:50,500
What the fuck how am I supposed to wall run up there?

2523
04:29:54,340 --> 04:30:00,660
Can it is there a crane the crane is down there can I climb

2524
04:30:02,500 --> 04:30:04,500
I

2525
04:30:06,260 --> 04:30:08,260
Can't make that jump what am I supposed to

2526
04:30:09,460 --> 04:30:12,340
Promise to be a platform around here somewhere. No

2527
04:30:15,620 --> 04:30:17,620
Can you take me up there

2528
04:30:20,420 --> 04:30:23,060
I could have jumped off the height in flat. Oh

2529
04:30:25,300 --> 04:30:27,300
Oh

2530
04:30:28,020 --> 04:30:30,020
Oh

2531
04:30:32,580 --> 04:30:34,580
Oh

2532
04:30:42,740 --> 04:30:47,380
Yeah, I'm fucking jumping like a motherfucker. Do I need to do anything here? I can't make that

2533
04:30:48,180 --> 04:30:50,180
I mean kilo one four

2534
04:30:51,620 --> 04:30:53,620
Yep

2710
04:48:43,860 --> 04:48:46,180
Oh, jeez what is that?

2711
04:48:51,620 --> 04:48:53,620
I guess I'll also hide behind a rock

2712
04:48:56,420 --> 04:48:58,420
I

2713
04:49:00,100 --> 04:49:02,100
Are you all the way over there?

2714
04:49:12,420 --> 04:49:14,900

Actually, you know, I should probably watch this from bt. Oh, let me come on

2720

04:51:51,140 --> 04:51:53,140
Take a bite of cookie

2743
04:51:53,300 --> 04:51:55,300
It's war paint

2744
04:51:57,860 --> 04:51:59,380
Mmm debatable

2745
04:52:01,380 --> 04:52:02,900
Boomi, what are you up to?

2746
04:52:09,060 --> 04:52:14,900
Oh, stretch my legs. Hi, Rena. What's up, Rena?

2747
04:52:16,180 --> 04:52:20,180
Rena, you can't I can't hold you right now. I'm putting my legs up because I was

2748
04:52:20,260 --> 04:52:23,460
I'll give you a hug. Do you want a hug?

2749
04:52:28,260 --> 04:52:34,100
Shake that chump. Da da da shake. I like to jiggle her. I like to jiggle her fatness

2750
04:52:36,100 --> 04:52:38,100
Rena's my cat

2751
04:52:38,100 --> 04:52:40,100
There's a lot of new faces today

2752
04:52:40,100 --> 04:52:43,220
Hello new faces. My name is Sheevee Cottonbum

2753
04:52:43,220 --> 04:52:45,220
Your face is so cute. You're so cute.

2754
04:52:46,180 --> 04:52:49,220
Hello new faces. My name is Sheevee Cottonbum

2755
04:52:49,700 --> 04:52:53,780
Your favorite girl failure Dom. I don't normally stream FPS's

2756
04:52:54,340 --> 04:52:56,340
But I wanted to have like an FPS week

2757
04:52:56,740 --> 04:53:00,100
um, I really I grew up playing a lot of FPS

2758
04:53:01,300 --> 04:53:03,060
but uh

2759
04:53:03,060 --> 04:53:04,740
Yeah

2760
04:53:04,740 --> 04:53:06,740
I don't know what else to say

2761
04:53:08,660 --> 04:53:13,460
Actually, Rena's not fat. Rena's a lot of sweet. Rena used to be 20 pounds and now she's like

2762
04:53:14,340 --> 04:53:16,820
Uh, normal size. She used to be a big cat

2763
04:53:18,020 --> 04:53:20,820
Now that she's older, I think she just doesn't retain as fat as much

2764
04:53:24,260 --> 04:53:28,900
Sorry, that was boomy. He just threw himself into my closet and fear and ran behind the dryer

2765
04:53:29,780 --> 04:53:31,460
by the way

2766
04:53:31,460 --> 04:53:36,820
How's Titanfall 2? Oh, love it. I played this game a year ago. It's nice to revisit it

2767
04:53:37,620 --> 04:53:39,620
you know

2768
04:53:39,620 --> 04:53:44,820
I'm not throwing insults. I'm sit. Did you not hear that crash in the background? I have a cat in my arms

2769
04:53:45,540 --> 04:53:47,540
my other cat Fia

2770
04:53:47,940 --> 04:53:51,700
Is paralyzed. She's not making that noise. She can't move

2771
04:53:53,140 --> 04:53:55,140
Rena's being held by me

2772
04:53:55,620 --> 04:53:57,620
That was boomy

2773
04:53:58,500 --> 04:54:01,220
Hello, Sheevee. I missed a bunch of streams because my power is out. How's it been?

2774
04:54:02,100 --> 04:54:06,420
Oh, that's okay. I hope your power here. I hope your power is back and you're not just like

2775
04:54:06,900 --> 04:54:08,900
messaging from a dying phone

2776
04:54:09,700 --> 04:54:11,700
Hey, I'm new. No, you're not. Get out of here

2777
04:54:12,900 --> 04:54:17,620
No, please stay. Um, boomy is just excited. He only has five more minutes until he's finally fed. What time is it?

2778
04:54:18,900 --> 04:54:22,820
8.55. You're right. I have my uh, I have something blocking my clock

2779
04:54:24,420 --> 04:54:27,860
I guess your cat wants your attention. Yeah, he always wants attention

2780
04:54:30,100 --> 04:54:33,060
If I promise it was most likely boomy

2781
04:54:33,780 --> 04:54:43,460
Yeah, one of you guys made that was really good. I think no, yeah, I think no one special made a made a meme pretty good. Pretty good

2782
04:54:44,340 --> 04:54:46,340
false

2783
04:54:47,460 --> 04:54:52,580
Um, in fact, I should probably put rain on the ground because she's probably gonna leap out of my arms when her food goes off

2784
04:54:53,540 --> 04:54:56,180
The power meter got ripped off the side of your house

2785
04:54:56,740 --> 04:54:57,540
What?

2786
04:54:58,740 --> 04:55:01,780
Jesus Christ, you're in your car

2787
04:55:03,060 --> 04:55:05,060
Oh man, that sucks

2788
04:55:05,540 --> 04:55:08,020
Who the did was it like a storm or something?

2789
04:55:08,820 --> 04:55:11,380
New viewers understand boomy never does it. No

2790
04:55:12,020 --> 04:55:13,620
stop

2791
04:55:13,620 --> 04:55:16,740
Diabolical thoughts lurking in boomy's mind. You never know

2792
04:55:18,980 --> 04:55:20,980
All renappers

2793
04:55:24,660 --> 04:55:29,060
I'll take a little break and feed fia then come back. How much was left I forget

2794
04:55:34,020 --> 04:55:36,020
Oh

2795
04:55:37,620 --> 04:55:42,820
I was gonna play Elden Ring after this, but honestly, I think I'll be too tired. You know, I think I'll be too much in sick

2796
04:55:44,420 --> 04:55:46,420
I just like want to play Elden Ring

2797
04:55:47,060 --> 04:55:50,260
I had to go do stupid stinky errands today

2798
04:55:53,380 --> 04:56:01,060
Uh, can you can you not step on my boob rena like I would appreciate if you didn't do that

2799
04:56:01,300 --> 04:56:04,500
Uh, can you out?

2800
04:56:06,580 --> 04:56:08,580
Man

2801
04:56:09,220 --> 04:56:11,540
Hi, now you're just sitting on my hand

2802
04:56:15,300 --> 04:56:17,300
I don't know what's happening here

2803
04:56:18,980 --> 04:56:24,900
I like all my regulars are like, hi, I'm new here. Please attention. Give please please

2804
04:56:26,420 --> 04:56:28,420
Oh my god, cat hair just went everywhere

2805
04:56:31,220 --> 04:56:33,220
Reena's pinned my uh

2806
04:56:34,900 --> 04:56:39,700
My right hand with her entire body it is I my hand is totally enveloped

2807
04:56:40,340 --> 04:56:43,700
In her tummy and she's laying on it like she's a chicken

2808
04:56:44,980 --> 04:56:46,980
Uh nesting on an egg

2809
04:56:49,620 --> 04:56:52,900
I don't know why she is how how she is like this. Um

2810
04:56:54,420 --> 04:56:57,300
And it's funny because like mind you picture this

2811
04:56:57,700 --> 04:56:59,700
I'm sitting in my

2812
04:57:00,820 --> 04:57:07,940
My my chair. I have the little foot rest up. Yes, that's one of you because I always get ahead of that little joke

2813
04:57:08,980 --> 04:57:10,500
Uh

2814
04:57:10,500 --> 04:57:14,260
So like my knees are kind of pointed towards my chest and my hand

2815
04:57:14,820 --> 04:57:21,220
Is resting on my leg both of my hands like I'm kind of just like like I'm fucking like I'm fucking l like I'm l from death note right now

2816
04:57:21,860 --> 04:57:23,860
And she has managed to walk on my desk

2817
04:57:24,660 --> 04:57:28,820
And lay on my entire hand on my right side

2818
04:57:31,060 --> 04:57:33,060
That's it

2819
04:57:34,740 --> 04:57:36,740
That's literally it

2820
04:57:37,780 --> 04:57:44,260
Uh, so imagine l but she had but l has she but he has a uh giant

2821
04:57:45,380 --> 04:57:47,620
Siamese cat just on one hand

2822
04:57:48,660 --> 04:57:52,660
But it's not like on like, you know l has it on his knees. No mine are like kind of further down

2823
04:57:54,100 --> 04:57:56,100
She just left because she heard me talking shit

2824
04:57:58,340 --> 04:58:02,900
Gotta let them know code she be 10% off gamer subs facts. Uh

2825
04:58:04,020 --> 04:58:09,700
Yeah, they just announced today finally about the uh anime girl thigh limited edition tub

2826
04:58:10,100 --> 04:58:13,540
I am on the tub with some amazing people. So it's

2827
04:58:14,180 --> 04:58:20,740
Really crazy. So if you uh, check it out. I retweeted on my twitter, but I am I might actually probably tweet about it on my

2828
04:58:21,620 --> 04:58:23,140
um

2829
04:58:23,140 --> 04:58:28,180
Not tweet about it post it on my youtube because it was really cool

2830
04:58:30,020 --> 04:58:33,620
Uh, once in a lifetime opportunity that I'm on a gamer subs tub

2831
04:58:34,180 --> 04:58:36,980
Um, they just picked one of us randomly

2832
04:58:37,940 --> 04:58:41,460
And they just picked me because they're just like, oh we need someone to fill this gap

2833
04:58:42,740 --> 04:58:45,700
And stronti's like here are my ladies

2834
04:58:47,460 --> 04:58:48,820
Um

2835
04:58:48,820 --> 04:58:55,620
Honestly, I hope in the future that we just get a veeler tub because I honestly feel really fucking bad

2836
04:58:55,700 --> 04:58:59,540
The other girls aren't on it. It kind of makes me sad. Um

2837
04:59:00,740 --> 04:59:02,740
But uh

2838
04:59:02,820 --> 04:59:08,260
Yeah, so one day I hope that we can get like we sell enough units you can get our own

2839
04:59:10,420 --> 04:59:12,420
Cat food dispenser my beloved

2840
04:59:12,980 --> 04:59:17,860
We can get our own flavor and stuff or like at least like maybe like a shaker cup. That'd be pretty sick

2841
04:59:18,980 --> 04:59:20,740
um

2842
04:59:20,740 --> 04:59:25,940
They saw the thighs so like we need those. I don't know. Uh, I see I see us some thiccum thighs

2843
04:59:26,100 --> 04:59:28,100
I see I see he's got some banging thighs

2844
04:59:28,500 --> 04:59:32,820
um, but again with the nuances of a cute and funny vtuber on that

2845
04:59:32,820 --> 04:59:37,220
That's probably why a flavor would be a lerby uh lemonade

2846
04:59:38,100 --> 04:59:40,100
obviously

2847
04:59:41,460 --> 04:59:43,460
Um might be loafed

2848
04:59:44,420 --> 04:59:52,420
Or thighs or no, I don't know. I I think the other girls have very like uh, zura or mercy is very recognizable

2849
04:59:54,580 --> 04:59:58,820
But it's just crazy because I'm like I'm right next to fucking shy lily on the tub

2850
04:59:59,620 --> 05:00:01,620
like can you believe that

2851
05:00:01,940 --> 05:00:04,900
And then like silver veil and like like what?

2852
05:00:06,340 --> 05:00:11,780
I think pink lemonade would be funny for like peeler. So like pink lemonade. That'd be funny. Um

2853
05:00:12,020 --> 05:00:14,020
But yeah, it's

2854
05:00:14,740 --> 05:00:16,740
It's pretty neat. It's

2855
05:00:16,820 --> 05:00:25,140
Pretty crazy. I I I couldn't believe it when strani was like, hey surprise. And this was like months ago before we even announced the gamer sub's

2856
05:00:25,860 --> 05:00:27,220
partnership

2857
05:00:27,220 --> 05:00:29,620
She was like, hey surprise. And I'm like, what?

2858
05:00:30,420 --> 05:00:35,860
The fuck me? Why me? And they're like, I don't know. I just picked you the artist was like I'll draw her

2859
05:00:36,980 --> 05:00:38,980
And I'm like

2860
05:00:39,460 --> 05:00:43,300
It's funny that it's my white self because again, it was before like I changed stuff. Um

2861
05:00:44,020 --> 05:00:48,020
That's fine. I don't really care. It's just nice. It's just really cool to have that in general

2862
05:00:48,900 --> 05:00:52,260
One day it'll be me. It'll be tan. She be on the on the tub

2863
05:00:53,140 --> 05:00:55,140
Um, let me feed

2864
05:00:56,020 --> 05:01:01,140
I'm the star scream of veeler. What is that supposed to fucking mean goal?

2865
05:01:01,940 --> 05:01:03,940
I

2866
05:01:04,420 --> 05:01:09,780
Don't know. It's so amazing able to put me on the tub if someone's famous. Yeah as me as me. I'm so famous

Oh

2902
05:03:52,740 --> 05:03:55,060
Hello, it's me distant she be

2903
05:03:56,900 --> 05:03:58,900
Uh, if you're new here

2904
05:03:59,860 --> 05:04:02,900
I have three cats. They are all signees

2905
05:04:03,780 --> 05:04:08,260
Boomy and fia are just over a year old boomy is a year in two months

2906
05:04:09,140 --> 05:04:10,500
Actually, no

2907
05:04:10,500 --> 05:04:12,500
Boomy's a year

2908
05:04:13,460 --> 05:04:20,340
I don't even know uh boomy is what a year in a month older. No boomy is a month older than fia. I can't think

2909
05:04:22,260 --> 05:04:24,260
Um

2910
05:04:24,340 --> 05:04:26,340
And rena's 14

2911
05:04:28,340 --> 05:04:30,340
Reena's my elderly baby

2912
05:04:32,180 --> 05:04:34,180
And um

2913
05:04:34,180 --> 05:04:38,900
F sadly has an auto-immune disease that makes her unable to move

2914
05:04:39,460 --> 05:04:48,500
And this happens periodically. It's like uh when a when a car runs out of gas she just runs out of gas

2915
05:04:49,460 --> 05:04:51,140
completely

2916
05:04:51,140 --> 05:04:54,980
And she's on the side of the road and she needs a little pick me up

2917
05:04:58,820 --> 05:05:05,380
She her disease it actually happens in humans too it's called misethene and gravus so she takes uh

2918
05:05:05,700 --> 05:05:07,700
Uh

2919
05:05:08,020 --> 05:05:13,220
I forget what how it actually works. It's like a type of thing that helps her body communicate that she wants to move

2920
05:05:13,620 --> 05:05:15,620
She's getting better every day

2921
05:05:15,620 --> 05:05:20,180
She's walk. She's been able to move before she's fine. Um, just sometimes she's

2922
05:05:21,220 --> 05:05:23,220
cat

2923
05:05:23,700 --> 05:05:26,200
So I have to feed her by hand

2924
05:05:28,500 --> 05:05:31,780
He's eating all the food because he's a fucking pig

2925
05:05:32,740 --> 05:05:34,740
I

2926
05:05:35,300 --> 05:05:41,860
These cats are very prone to obesity. So I really have to watch boobies wave. I don't I don't need booby being bad

2927
05:05:42,900 --> 05:05:46,500
I have an automatic feeder. I might have to like temporarily

2928
05:05:48,580 --> 05:05:50,580
Get rid of it booby's gonna

2929
05:05:51,140 --> 05:05:53,140
impulsively eat the food

2930
05:05:53,540 --> 05:06:00,020
Um rena I used to have a different feeder when it was just rena and she would have the food

2931
05:06:00,420 --> 05:06:02,020
dispenser

2932
05:06:02,020 --> 05:06:07,220
And stick her paw into it and somehow get more out and that's how she got so fat at first

2933
05:06:07,700 --> 05:06:10,260
Hi, rena. Nice. I'm talking about you, ma'am

2934
05:06:11,460 --> 05:06:13,460

2935
05:06:14,180 --> 05:06:16,180
Are you awake?

2936
05:06:17,060 --> 05:06:19,060
Hi

2937
05:06:28,660 --> 05:06:32,580
Am I here for you as I move her?

2938
05:06:35,140 --> 05:06:39,060
Don't worry. I'm not putting you in the litter box. I'm just sitting down in the chair

2939
05:06:40,820 --> 05:06:42,820
She's like what's happening?

2940
05:06:42,820 --> 05:06:44,820
Oh

2941
05:06:45,940 --> 05:06:47,940
That's it. I got the blanket in the water

2942
05:06:53,700 --> 05:07:01,540

05:07:22,820 --> 05:07:24,820
Where you want to go?

2948
05:07:27,620 --> 05:07:30,180
Do you not want to eat in my lap? Do you want to eat someplace else?

2949
05:07:32,900 --> 05:07:37,220
Is this too distracting for you? You don't like to be the center of attention

2950
05:07:38,180 --> 05:07:45,380
You don't look at me with that goofy face. Come on

2951
05:07:48,020 --> 05:07:50,020
There she goes

2952
05:07:50,180 --> 05:07:52,180
Have some kitty crunches

2953
05:07:52,340 --> 05:07:56,500
Don't worry for you. It's just me moving from the microphone. She's got so scared

2954
05:07:57,460 --> 05:07:59,460
You don't have to wrap against it

2955
05:08:00,260 --> 05:08:02,900
Boomie go away

2956
05:08:03,220 --> 05:08:07,860
You do not need to eat and rena's trying to eat now that boomie is away from the food bowl

2957
05:08:08,340 --> 05:08:13,060
And there's barely any food in it. There's like probably like a couple pieces of kibble because boomie ate both sides

2958
05:08:16,660 --> 05:08:18,980
No boomie boomie don't eat that

2959
05:08:20,420 --> 05:08:22,420

3037
05:14:39,620 --> 05:14:41,620
Oh

3038
05:14:44,180 --> 05:14:47,940
When you're sitting in the cat tree like I took the picture this morning

3039
05:14:49,460 --> 05:14:51,460
Staring at him

3040
05:14:54,660 --> 05:14:58,340
Go away it's V is time to eat

3041
05:15:09,220 --> 05:15:19,780
You want you to sit like that why you sit like a truck driver you made it to the couch. He is Garfield. So do we are correct

3042
05:15:23,380 --> 05:15:25,380
What do you mean get her boomy

3043
05:15:27,140 --> 05:15:30,820
Why are you looking at me? He's like sitting and jumping me in that pose

3044
05:15:32,420 --> 05:15:36,980
I don't know why I like I try to like I'm trying to teach him how to gap up like I try to like fist bump him

3045
05:15:37,460 --> 05:15:39,460
Like I'll slap like I'll I'll

3046
05:15:39,780 --> 05:15:45,460
Not like slap his paw, but I'll like you know how you like you gap someone. You just like you go slap the bump

3047
05:15:46,340 --> 05:15:48,340
I'm trying to teach him how to do it

3048
05:15:48,500 --> 05:15:50,500
When he's in that pose

3049
05:15:50,500 --> 05:15:52,500
It's kind of working

3050
05:15:59,220 --> 05:16:01,220
I'll take a picture of how it looks like

3051
05:16:07,620 --> 05:16:09,620
It's hard to take a photo

3052
05:16:26,260 --> 05:16:28,260
Yeah, I think it was a work in progress and

3053
05:16:30,100 --> 05:16:33,860
Thank you for letting me take a little moment to feed my cat everybody by the way

3054
05:16:33,860 --> 05:16:37,700
It's called close to picture right now

3055
05:16:40,020 --> 05:16:42,020
Live Theo reaction

3056
05:16:50,340 --> 05:16:52,340
Live Theo reaction

3057
05:16:58,900 --> 05:17:01,700
Yeah, right now you you make you

3058
05:17:04,180 --> 05:17:08,180
You do that girl

3059
05:17:17,300 --> 05:17:19,300
Are you looking at me like that Theo?

3060
05:17:21,780 --> 05:17:25,780
He's giving you bombastic side eye right now. Is it because you've been on close to me?

3061
05:17:28,980 --> 05:17:30,980
You need to set up a little bit more movement

3062
05:17:33,860 --> 05:17:35,860
You

3063
05:17:43,300 --> 05:17:45,300
Bet she needs to drop it here

3064
05:17:57,140 --> 05:18:00,020
Sorry for moving you I know you're doing that I feel

3065
05:18:00,340 --> 05:18:02,340
Good

3066
05:18:02,340 --> 05:18:04,340
Now you look comfortable

3067
05:18:06,340 --> 05:18:08,340
If he is eyeing you feel warm

3068
05:18:11,060 --> 05:18:13,060
Here you go

3069
05:18:13,860 --> 05:18:15,860
Hello

3070
05:18:15,860 --> 05:18:17,860
Good job

3071
05:18:30,020 --> 05:18:32,020
You

3072
05:18:43,700 --> 05:18:46,100
You take cat it's a marlin everything for this

3073
05:18:46,740 --> 05:18:52,500
What happened to Theo? She has a uh an auto immune disease or she can't move

3074
05:18:53,540 --> 05:18:55,540
So she paralyzed from

3075
05:18:56,580 --> 05:18:58,580
a bow like

3076
05:18:59,540 --> 05:19:05,780
The chest down I'd say she's getting better. Um, so what is it's like

3077
05:19:07,300 --> 05:19:09,300
Her body

3078
05:19:09,860 --> 05:19:15,140
Can't communicate with her muscles to move like there's a chemical reaction, you know that has to occur

3079
05:19:15,700 --> 05:19:19,940
For that to happen and she's been saying I believe the amino acid to do so

3080
05:19:21,940 --> 05:19:24,340
Um, her body stops producing it

3081
05:19:25,300 --> 05:19:31,140
And it means assistance to producing otherwise you kind of like just stop moving

3082
05:19:32,900 --> 05:19:35,140
And this is the second time this has happened

3083
05:19:35,940 --> 05:19:39,380
The last time um, we thought it was like a one-time thing

3084
05:19:40,420 --> 05:19:42,420
So we like I didn't know that it was chronic

3085
05:19:44,580 --> 05:19:49,700
Right now can you stop scratching so well? I don't know what you're doing in there, but you're not stupid

3086
05:19:49,700 --> 05:19:51,700
But

3087
05:19:53,860 --> 05:19:55,860
Yeah

3088
05:20:01,060 --> 05:20:05,860
I'm just sitting on the couch with her because she just did she insisted on being on the couch

3089
05:20:07,540 --> 05:20:09,540
Now she's

3090
05:20:10,820 --> 05:20:12,820
Now we're hanging out

3091
05:20:19,700 --> 05:20:21,700
So

3092
05:20:29,700 --> 05:20:31,700
I might go quiet for a moment

3093
05:20:49,940 --> 05:20:51,940
Oh

3094
05:21:00,340 --> 05:21:06,660
I hope you had a good time touching grass views from playing in Titanfall and I think I'm almost on the game. I'm not quite sure

3095
05:21:19,700 --> 05:21:21,700
I

3096
05:21:49,700 --> 05:21:51,700
I

3097
05:22:19,700 --> 05:22:21,700
Oh

3098
05:22:21,700 --> 05:22:23,700
I

3099
05:22:51,700 --> 05:22:53,700
I

3100
05:23:21,700 --> 05:23:23,700
I

3101
05:23:51,700 --> 05:23:53,700
I

3102
05:23:53,700 --> 05:23:55,700

3103
05:24:15,140 --> 05:24:18,260

3104
05:24:18,260 --> 05:24:20,260
He has left over

3105
05:24:20,980 --> 05:24:23,860
And I have to hide it in the microwave

3106
05:24:24,100 --> 05:24:29,060
So he because that's the only place you can't get into because you can open doors and cabinets

3107
05:24:29,620 --> 05:24:31,620
but the microwave

3108
05:24:31,700 --> 05:24:33,700
You need phones, baby

3109
05:24:33,700 --> 05:24:35,700
So you can't do that

3110
05:24:37,140 --> 05:24:39,140
Nice try

3111
05:24:39,780 --> 05:24:46,180
Okay, you're gonna hear uh Fias actually no, you know, I should just be for this you guys don't need to hear my cat using the bathroom

3112
05:24:46,180 --> 05:24:49,140

Where's my blanket? Oh, it's behind me

3138
05:35:26,180 --> 05:35:33,300
Did you swap out the fuck I didn't do it? Oh my god, I got distracted by eating tomatoes from my mom's garden

3139
05:35:46,180 --> 05:35:48,180
You

3140
05:36:02,820 --> 05:36:05,860
Let me come out of the closet, please

3141
05:36:07,540 --> 05:36:09,540
I'm sorry

3142
05:36:16,180 --> 05:36:18,180
I'm not

3143
05:36:20,020 --> 05:36:24,580
Excuse me, you guys go. Boomi, there's nothing in there for you

3144
05:36:26,100 --> 05:36:27,700

05:36:27,700 --> 05:36:29,700
Boomi get out of the closet

3146
05:36:31,140 --> 05:36:33,140
Boomi get out of the closet

3147
05:36:34,020 --> 05:36:36,180
Why are you standing up like a human there?

3148
05:36:37,300 --> 05:36:39,300
So go get the spring

3149
05:36:41,140 --> 05:36:44,660
Right, let's not your time to jump in there. Okay Jesus Christ

3150
05:36:46,420 --> 05:36:48,420
You

3151
05:36:53,940 --> 05:37:00,180
Yeah, my friend can do this little brother from the wild born berries really well

3152
05:37:02,420 --> 05:37:06,020
She goes crazy. She's the one that I get the R2D2 voice from that's Salem

3153
05:37:06,660 --> 05:37:11,700
Salem does some funny voices as well. I got some tomatoes here. Boomi go away

3154
05:37:12,340 --> 05:37:16,900
Hey, I have some tomatoes here and I have some ranch

3155
05:37:19,940 --> 05:37:24,980
Boomi was trying to steal the ranch when I was like seeing if it would taste good with the ranch

3156
05:37:25,780 --> 05:37:28,980
And he licked the cap so I had to wash it

3157
05:37:31,060 --> 05:37:37,300
It's pretty my mom's tomatoes are pretty good. They're like better. Um and store bought

3158
05:37:37,300 --> 05:37:42,340
They're so sweet but also a little tangy

3159
05:37:47,780 --> 05:37:49,780
Being a single mother sounds rough

3160
05:37:51,860 --> 05:37:57,940
Extremely oh, I never put my phone back up. I'm just staring awkwardly

3161
05:38:07,860 --> 05:38:09,860
Hmm

3162
05:38:16,740 --> 05:38:20,100
There we go, there we go. Here we are brothers

3163
05:38:22,340 --> 05:38:26,100
Are we all ready to lock in the children are tucked in bed?

3164
05:38:27,300 --> 05:38:31,540
Boomi is drinking water rena is laying on

3165
05:38:32,100 --> 05:38:34,100
a

3166
05:38:34,660 --> 05:38:38,180
Piece of cardboard that is now her favorite spot from a box

3167
05:38:39,620 --> 05:38:44,900
That my whiteboard came in. Thank you guys for the throne gifts by the way. I already started using the whiteboard

3168
05:38:51,140 --> 05:38:55,700
I was also just dipping green beans in it. It's very good. Just like homegrown green beans

3169
05:38:56,180 --> 05:39:04,820
Now I'm also giving me a spaghetti squash, but I don't know how to cook spaghetti squash. I'll have to figure that out

3170
05:39:08,660 --> 05:39:12,500
Ready for lock in ready for pop lock and drop it

3171
05:39:14,580 --> 05:39:16,580
Pop lock and drop it

3172
05:39:20,180 --> 05:39:22,180
I used to hate ranch

3173
05:39:22,500 --> 05:39:28,180
Then in like the last like two years I started liking it so weird

3174
05:39:28,980 --> 05:39:30,980
I used to also hate cheese

3175
05:39:31,060 --> 05:39:33,060
And now I just don't like eggs

3176
05:39:33,060 --> 05:39:35,060
I don't know why this is

3177
05:39:38,820 --> 05:39:41,220
And now I like I'm kind of indifferent to cheese now

3178
05:39:42,180 --> 05:39:44,260
My cheese is all right. I don't know why to you

3179
05:39:45,460 --> 05:39:47,460
I'm not like super into cheese

3180
05:39:47,620 --> 05:39:52,580
Um, but if somebody gives me an egg like I'd probably rather not eat it like I'll eat it

3181
05:39:52,660 --> 05:39:53,700
but like

3182
05:39:53,700 --> 05:39:58,900
It's like an egg sandwich. Sometimes if I don't finish the egg sandwich, I'll just pick off like the bread and the

3183
05:40:00,020 --> 05:40:01,940
What's it called?

3184
05:40:01,940 --> 05:40:03,940
like the meat

3185
05:40:04,180 --> 05:40:06,820
And I'll just eat that and I'll just not eat finish the egg

3186
05:40:08,020 --> 05:40:12,980
I do like grilled cheese depends on the cheese. Yeah mercy got you. No, I've been like that for a while

3187
05:40:13,220 --> 05:40:23,700
And she's allergic to eggs so isn't she oh wait, is she I don't know how she was allergic. I could be totally wrong

3188
05:40:27,540 --> 05:40:29,540
No, I don't like it

3189
05:40:31,380 --> 05:40:34,180
I hate blue cheese though blue cheese is disgusting

3190
05:40:35,780 --> 05:40:38,020
Blue cheese. No, thank you

3191
05:40:39,620 --> 05:40:41,620
That's a negative for me dog

3192
05:40:43,380 --> 05:40:45,380
It'd be funny if like the game ended right here

3193
05:40:46,500 --> 05:40:48,500
Hi

3194
05:40:57,220 --> 05:40:59,220
What's really weird is that like all other

3195
05:41:04,980 --> 05:41:06,980
All other

3196
05:41:07,380 --> 05:41:08,980
Titans

3197
05:41:08,980 --> 05:41:12,260
Feel very just like that. They're just robots. Oh shit

3198
05:41:12,980 --> 05:41:14,980
Oh my god, I totally forgot about actual Titanfall

3199
05:41:15,540 --> 05:41:19,700
Um, whereas BT has is very humanized like her like

3200
05:41:20,420 --> 05:41:23,700
They don't really care about their Titans. It seems like there's no like

3201
05:41:25,380 --> 05:41:27,780
Humane acts aspect of the other ones

3202
05:41:32,500 --> 05:41:34,500
Sorry, I'm chewing on tomatoes here

3203
05:41:39,780 --> 05:41:42,260
I was already um, is this to be like doing something

3204
05:41:42,980 --> 05:41:44,980
I

3205
05:41:52,340 --> 05:41:54,340
Was just a fancy cut scene

3206
05:41:59,300 --> 05:42:01,780
They're dead it's okay

3207
05:42:04,180 --> 05:42:08,500
I wonder what happens if you kill the Ronan before or I wonder if they have to die

3208
05:42:13,700 --> 05:42:15,700
Oh

This is crazy. Oh boy is lasering me. Holy crap

3226
05:45:07,380 --> 05:45:11,220

3227
05:45:13,140 --> 05:45:17,060
I didn't even know he's behind us. Is everybody else fucking dead like where is everyone?

3228
05:45:18,340 --> 05:45:20,340

Punch him to death give me his battery. Did you take it bitch? It's my kill

3234
05:46:00,820 --> 05:46:04,580
I'll get to the tunnel what fucking tunnel

3235
05:46:07,460 --> 05:46:09,460
You know, I kind of miss

I can't I don't know

3237
05:46:11,540 --> 05:46:17,940
I'm wondering what maps they have for Titanfall 2 because I never played timefall 2 multiplayer to be honest because the servers were down

3238
05:46:18,740 --> 05:46:20,580
um

3239
05:46:20,580 --> 05:46:26,100
So I I wonder what the type of maps they have because I really like Titanfall 1 maps

3240
05:46:27,060 --> 05:46:34,100
What are my cats doing? What do you do? Oh, Boomi's playing with the toy. That's fine. I thought he was eating something

3241
05:46:37,380 --> 05:46:40,260
What is this? Oh, that's pretty neat. Can I get your gun?

3242
05:46:42,740 --> 05:46:46,340
We have like a little machine gun. Is there a battery around? No

3243
05:46:48,660 --> 05:46:50,660
Quick electric smoke

3244
05:46:57,060 --> 05:46:59,060
Sick

3245
05:47:02,740 --> 05:47:04,740
Can I stop?

3246
05:47:13,860 --> 05:47:15,860
I'm trying my best

3247
05:47:15,860 --> 05:47:17,860
Oh, it's a sports

3248
05:47:21,140 --> 05:47:23,140
Hey

3249
05:47:26,420 --> 05:47:35,060
Let's dance. There's gonna be no dancing. This is a long-sighted thing, bro. Where are you going?

3250
05:47:36,740 --> 05:47:38,740
Actually, it's two-sided because we're like gangbanging

3251
05:47:41,300 --> 05:47:43,300
Am I

3252
05:47:43,940 --> 05:47:45,940
You're about to get lucky and dead

3253
05:47:49,940 --> 05:47:51,940
Yeah

3254
05:47:56,100 --> 05:47:58,100
Kind of sick of you guys shooting us

3255
05:48:03,300 --> 05:48:05,460
I don't know what my cat's doing in the background

3256
05:48:08,420 --> 05:48:10,420
What are you all

3257
05:48:13,140 --> 05:48:19,540
Braina is literally having so much fun on a piece of cardboard right now. I love her for that. Am I supposed to go up over here?

3258
05:48:20,500 --> 05:48:27,780
We've got to get to that shit before it takes off take those Titans out pilot. I don't see any looks like you took a wrong turn

3259
05:48:31,140 --> 05:48:33,140
What

3260
05:48:37,780 --> 05:48:39,780
I need a battery

3261
05:48:42,580 --> 05:48:46,980
Get out of the fucking way. Oh my god, this fucking bitch

3262
05:48:50,500 --> 05:48:52,500

3263
05:49:06,580 --> 05:49:08,580
That's her staying in fucking front of me

3264
05:49:13,620 --> 05:49:16,500
Yeah, she's like literally and she like mind you like rena is older

3265
05:49:16,500 --> 05:49:21,300
She's 14. So just to see her jump around like a little kitten full of joy is quite adorable

3266
05:49:22,660 --> 05:49:27,940
It also looks like she's break dancing on a piece of cardboard. So there she is. We still have time to intercept the arc

3267
05:49:31,620 --> 05:49:37,060
Move move. Sorry. I'm busy sniper real gun charges up while zoomed

3268
05:49:38,580 --> 05:49:42,980

3274
05:50:10,260 --> 05:50:12,260

05:50:14,580 --> 05:50:18,340
Geez can I can I can I walk in?

3276
05:50:24,500 --> 05:50:26,500
Okay, so if I

3277
05:50:29,380 --> 05:50:31,380
How do I hover

3278
05:50:31,540 --> 05:50:33,540
I

3279
05:50:37,620 --> 05:50:43,940
How do I do that little oh my god, did you hear that like oh i'm gonna die uh

3280
05:50:45,460 --> 05:50:52,900
Did you hear that bang against my window? Yeah, that was rena running into it. No walk on that's not nice

3281
05:51:01,460 --> 05:51:03,460
In that core

3282
05:51:07,700 --> 05:51:14,660
I can't remember what titan I used a lot when I was doing this stuff black or do it

3283
05:51:21,940 --> 05:51:26,420
Why am I so close go no no i'm gonna die if I get too close. Oh my god

3284
05:51:31,380 --> 05:51:33,380
I don't really think it was nice. So thanks

3285
05:51:51,860 --> 05:51:54,660
I do that thing where I can lock someone down

3286
05:52:02,180 --> 05:52:06,260
Oh, oh no, no not me. No

3287
05:52:10,980 --> 05:52:12,980
Shut up

3288
05:52:14,740 --> 05:52:16,740
She okay, she's fine

3289
05:52:17,220 --> 05:52:19,220
She's just sitting there now

3290
05:52:19,700 --> 05:52:24,180
They get excited and so what they do they jump on the cat tree and it's against my window

3291
05:52:24,500 --> 05:52:26,500
That's what they bang into the cat tree

3292
05:52:27,460 --> 05:52:29,460
And uh

3293
05:52:30,660 --> 05:52:32,660
I just make silly long noise

3294
05:52:37,700 --> 05:52:43,780
No, and she only started doing that because actually you know what I won't blame for me for that that's definitely rena

3295
05:52:45,060 --> 05:52:47,540
Because rena's did that before I even had for me. So

3296
05:52:48,660 --> 05:52:50,660
Before I gave birth to him

3297
05:52:50,820 --> 05:52:54,340
How are you not dead? Oh, are you a good guy?

3298
05:52:54,340 --> 05:52:56,340
I

3299
05:52:57,940 --> 05:52:59,940
That was weird

3300
05:53:02,180 --> 05:53:04,180
Tether trap

3301
05:53:05,780 --> 05:53:07,780
Perfect

3302
05:53:13,300 --> 05:53:15,300
This is actually pretty good for the distance

3303
05:53:15,540 --> 05:53:17,540
I actually

3304
05:53:21,540 --> 05:53:23,540
Shut up I just killed like the same dude

3305
05:53:27,300 --> 05:53:30,900
Sometimes I just want to run around and like kill these guys because they're just

3306
05:53:31,860 --> 05:53:33,860
I

3307
05:53:44,980 --> 05:53:46,980
Oh

3308
05:53:49,620 --> 05:53:51,620
Come close

3309
05:54:00,900 --> 05:54:02,900
What are you gonna do?

3310
05:54:04,980 --> 05:54:06,980
Don't you dare take it bitch

3311
05:54:13,700 --> 05:54:16,180
I really think that's how that works that's fine

3312
05:54:26,580 --> 05:54:28,580
Who are you shooting at

3313
05:54:31,860 --> 05:54:33,860
You're not nobody

3314
05:54:35,780 --> 05:54:37,780
Scratching my eye

3315
05:54:39,060 --> 05:54:41,860
Enemy's locking up. What am I doing?

3316
05:54:44,500 --> 05:54:47,780
I press E instead of w when after I was done scratching my eye

3317
05:54:52,740 --> 05:54:54,980
Don't run away come back

3318
05:55:01,300 --> 05:55:03,300

Don't even know what I'm shooting at. Oh, he spun around

3322
05:55:45,140 --> 05:55:47,140
Surrounded and dead

3323
05:55:50,420 --> 05:55:52,420

3324
05:55:52,420 --> 05:55:54,420

3328
05:56:23,220 --> 05:56:25,220
Oh

Salvo color way

05:57:18,660 --> 05:57:20,660
What do you guys do over there?

3334
05:57:21,620 --> 05:57:23,620

05:58:00,500 --> 05:58:04,980
Yeah, kick them getting enough on them. Oh

3342
05:58:21,620 --> 05:58:24,260
Why didn't you guys kill the dude behind you? I don't

3343
05:58:27,700 --> 05:58:29,700
It's mine

3344

What are you shooting at I just

05:59:13,380 --> 05:59:15,380
I don't know what the target is there

3351
05:59:16,580 --> 05:59:18,580
I

3352
05:59:21,620 --> 05:59:23,620
Don't know

3353
05:59:23,860 --> 05:59:28,340
Everybody else is dead that sucks. Well, it's real life. We're the main characters

3354
05:59:29,300 --> 05:59:31,300
Uh

3355
05:59:42,820 --> 05:59:44,820
I'm back here. I'm back up

3356
05:59:48,500 --> 05:59:50,500
I can't really do that

3357
05:59:50,660 --> 05:59:52,500
I

3358
05:59:52,500 --> 05:59:56,580
Did that actually happen? Sorry my own thing. I don't

3359
05:59:56,820 --> 05:59:58,820
I don't quite get that

3360
06:00:20,340 --> 06:00:24,020
I feel like we should have more Titans on our team. I feel like this should be a thing

3361
06:00:24,980 --> 06:00:28,660
Except oh they there they are and we got reinforcements

3362
06:00:30,900 --> 06:00:34,260
Oh my god, where did you come from? I can't hit you. Oh you hit me

3369
06:01:29,140 --> 06:01:31,140
Ah

Why why would you take on me?

3371
06:01:44,100 --> 06:01:47,620
Oh god, why would you do more time falls on me?

3372
06:01:50,100 --> 06:01:55,700
Oh my god, what is happening? I'm not gonna die. I'm gonna literally fucking stop telling me

3373
06:01:56,980 --> 06:01:58,980
About that. I don't care

3374
06:02:08,260 --> 06:02:10,580
Yeah, what the fuck am I supposed to do there? I don't

3375
06:02:13,220 --> 06:02:15,220

At least I spawn in whenever he's almost dead

3378
06:02:27,220 --> 06:02:31,620
Why do you not finish what you started she just lets him live

3379
06:02:33,460 --> 06:02:35,460
This one didn't even drop a battery

3380
06:02:36,580 --> 06:02:38,580

06:21:48,820 --> 06:21:54,180
It's not fair that I got to fight three guys. I didn't mean to heal

3556
06:22:07,220 --> 06:22:09,060
Thing oh my god

3557
06:22:12,500 --> 06:22:14,500
Fuck rain up

3558
06:22:18,740 --> 06:22:22,740
I'm sorry cat is laying. Oh my god

3559
06:22:22,740 --> 06:22:24,740
All right

3560
06:22:47,460 --> 06:22:49,460
No bt don't fall off

3561
06:22:53,620 --> 06:22:58,900
This is your stop. Oh, how are you hitting me when I'm behind this and I can't pick this up

3562
06:23:01,140 --> 06:23:05,780
Oh my god, no, I can't where is it?

3563
06:23:18,180 --> 06:23:21,700
I don't know if that does it makes me feel better. Oh

3564
06:23:23,300 --> 06:23:26,580
I feel like I shouldn't have this build

3565
06:23:32,260 --> 06:23:38,660
Oh, why do you why do you do that when I I don't can I have the battery?

3566
06:23:38,660 --> 06:23:40,660
I

3567
06:23:48,100 --> 06:23:52,420
For one we're taking cover brass four visual point oh nine two three move in

3568
06:23:54,500 --> 06:23:56,500
Really take the cover you're kind of just hanging out

3569
06:23:58,900 --> 06:24:00,900
Ah

3570
06:24:01,940 --> 06:24:03,940
And it's in moving in for the kill

3571
06:24:03,940 --> 06:24:05,940
Oh

3572
06:24:28,260 --> 06:24:31,060
I thought it said I had the laser shot. Do I know it?

3573
06:24:32,020 --> 06:24:39,460
Speed is light. I'm so confused. It like got rid of my laser shot. What just happened. I don't understand

3574
06:24:43,300 --> 06:24:45,300
I'm quite confused here

3575
06:24:49,780 --> 06:24:51,780
Do you guys have any batteries

3576
06:24:52,740 --> 06:24:54,740
That required

3577
06:24:56,500 --> 06:25:01,540
Uh, I I oh I could charge that

3578
06:25:05,860 --> 06:25:08,660
I know I was trying to use my laser core and it wasn't letting me

3579
06:25:13,300 --> 06:25:18,660
And it's got core break hard too. Well now. Oh now it does when I can't even hit him

3580
06:25:21,780 --> 06:25:23,780
I guess I am i'm gonna die

3581
06:25:45,140 --> 06:25:47,140
Even north star would actually probably be best

3582
06:25:49,460 --> 06:25:51,460
Okay

3583
06:25:52,740 --> 06:25:54,740
No

3584
06:26:00,740 --> 06:26:06,440
Wait, so it puts me in the middle of the fucking fight. I don't I'd rather just start it over at this point

3585
06:26:06,440 --> 06:26:08,440
I

3586
06:26:18,520 --> 06:26:22,920
What the frick I can't even tell where he has me tethered

3587
06:26:26,840 --> 06:26:32,200
Uh, I don't have a thingy I keep forgetting I'm doing I

Bro, I'm just not thinking straight right now

3590
06:26:45,320 --> 06:26:47,320
He hits me once

3591
06:27:02,360 --> 06:27:12,840
I get those fucking tethers away from me

3592
06:27:25,160 --> 06:27:27,160
Nice

3593
06:27:33,160 --> 06:27:35,160
Two can play this game, bitch

3594
06:27:47,480 --> 06:27:50,200
Yeah, I shouldn't have never done whatever the fuck that was

3595
06:27:53,080 --> 06:27:56,200
Oh my god, it's so hard to read you when you're floating in the fucking air

3596
06:27:58,600 --> 06:28:00,600
I'm gonna

3597
06:28:02,760 --> 06:28:06,280
So close to killing you

3598
06:28:08,040 --> 06:28:14,120
Oh, no, you got your fucking thing back. Oh battery battery. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna batter

3599
06:28:17,080 --> 06:28:19,080
I'm going for it bt

3600
06:28:21,320 --> 06:28:23,320
I can't find it. Oh

3601
06:28:26,760 --> 06:28:29,320
Oh my god, I'm fucking choking

3602
06:28:33,160 --> 06:28:35,160
Oh my god, bro

3603
06:28:40,760 --> 06:28:46,280
Right now you look like a chinchilla. Did you know that you know you look like a chinchilla

3604
06:28:47,880 --> 06:28:51,560
What's up? Hi. Hi new girl

You

3607
06:29:01,000 --> 06:29:03,880
Rub the baby cat for strength

3608
06:29:05,480 --> 06:29:08,200
Kiss the kitty cat for strength

3609
06:29:11,320 --> 06:29:17,800
It is a default seem good. No, I think what the north star it's good because then I can fly and kind of meet him

3610
06:29:18,920 --> 06:29:20,920

3614
06:29:34,920 --> 06:29:36,920
Oh

06:30:01,820 --> 06:30:03,820
My god, I'm getting my ass 8

3616
06:30:04,920 --> 06:30:14,860
I'm not sure what's going on.

3617
06:30:14,860 --> 06:30:16,040
Here you go.

3618
06:30:16,040 --> 06:30:17,040
Regrouping.

3619
06:30:17,040 --> 06:30:18,040
Prime three, check right.

3620
06:30:18,040 --> 06:30:19,040
Press forward.

3621
06:30:19,040 --> 06:30:20,040
First core ready.

3622
06:30:20,040 --> 06:30:21,040
Man, it's got core.

3623
06:30:21,040 --> 06:30:22,040
Good tone.

3624
06:30:22,040 --> 06:30:23,040
Third tone.

3625
06:30:23,040 --> 06:30:24,040
Fox 10.

3626
06:30:24,040 --> 06:30:40,040
Yeah, you're fucking going to die, bitch.

3627
06:30:40,040 --> 06:30:50,040
Oh, you can see me, you can see me, you can see me, you can see me, you can see me.

3628
06:30:50,040 --> 06:30:51,040
Yeah.

3629
06:30:51,040 --> 06:30:52,040
Nice.

3630
06:30:52,040 --> 06:30:54,040
You just got to stick with the classics.

3631
06:30:54,040 --> 06:30:55,040
Oh.

3632
06:30:55,040 --> 06:30:56,040
Oh.

3633
06:30:56,040 --> 06:30:57,040
Oh.

3634
06:30:57,040 --> 06:30:58,040
Oh.

3635
06:30:58,040 --> 06:30:59,040
Oh.

3636
06:30:59,040 --> 06:31:00,040
Oh.

3637
06:31:00,040 --> 06:31:01,040
Oh.

3638
06:31:01,040 --> 06:31:02,040
Oh.

3639
06:31:02,040 --> 06:31:24,040
I didn't mean to shoot that.

3640
06:31:24,040 --> 06:31:25,040
Oh.

3641
06:31:25,040 --> 06:31:26,040
Oh, sorry.

3642
06:31:26,040 --> 06:31:30,680
Let me run all the way fucking back here.

3643
06:31:30,680 --> 06:31:35,680
Nina has hotdog between herself, hotdog herself between me and the desk.

3644
06:31:35,680 --> 06:31:46,680
Okay, so she literally is a little hotdog, her ring.

3645
06:31:46,680 --> 06:31:47,680
Okay.

3646
06:31:47,680 --> 06:31:48,680
Oh, you motherfucker.

3647
06:31:48,680 --> 06:31:51,680
I can't really do anything.

3648
06:31:51,680 --> 06:31:52,680
BT.

3649
06:31:52,680 --> 06:31:53,680
BT.

3650
06:31:53,680 --> 06:31:54,680
Oh my God.

3651
06:31:54,680 --> 06:31:59,680
I need to get the fuck up.

3652
06:31:59,680 --> 06:32:07,680
BT, BT, BT, let me get inside.

3653
06:32:07,680 --> 06:32:08,680
BT.

3654
06:32:08,680 --> 06:32:09,680
BT, BT, BT.

3655
06:32:09,680 --> 06:32:10,680
I lost a hatch.

3656
06:32:10,680 --> 06:32:11,680
Need cover, need cover.

3657
06:32:11,680 --> 06:32:12,680
No, no, no, no.

3658
06:32:12,680 --> 06:32:13,680
Aim for the cockpit.

3659
06:32:13,680 --> 06:32:14,680
I'm aiming.

3660
06:32:14,680 --> 06:32:15,680
I'm aiming.

3661
06:32:15,680 --> 06:32:16,680
Just fucked.

3662
06:32:16,680 --> 06:32:17,680
Now I want your fucking robot.

3663
06:32:17,680 --> 06:32:18,680
Fuck you.

3664
06:32:18,680 --> 06:32:19,680
Fuck you.

3665
06:32:19,680 --> 06:32:20,680
Fuck you.

3666
06:32:20,680 --> 06:32:21,680
Fuck you.

3667
06:32:21,680 --> 06:32:22,680
Fuck you.

3668
06:32:22,680 --> 06:32:23,680
Fuck you.

3669
06:32:23,680 --> 06:32:24,680
Fuck you.

3670
06:32:24,680 --> 06:32:25,680
Fuck you.

3671
06:32:25,680 --> 06:32:26,680
Fuck you.

3672
06:32:26,680 --> 06:32:27,680
Fuck you.

3673
06:32:27,680 --> 06:32:28,680
Fuck you.

3674
06:32:28,680 --> 06:32:29,680
Fuck you.

3675
06:32:29,680 --> 06:32:30,680
Fuck you.

3676
06:32:30,680 --> 06:32:31,680
Fuck you.

3677
06:32:31,680 --> 06:32:32,680
You thought you could hurt BT?

3678
06:32:32,680 --> 06:32:33,680
You motherfucker?

3679
06:32:33,680 --> 06:32:34,680
No.

3680
06:32:34,680 --> 06:32:35,680
None of my watch.

3681
06:32:35,680 --> 06:32:36,680
You okay?

3682
06:32:36,680 --> 06:32:37,680
You okay, bro?

3683
06:32:37,680 --> 06:32:38,680
Your arm's gone.

3684
06:32:38,680 --> 06:32:39,680
Okay.

3685
06:32:39,680 --> 06:32:42,680
This shit is rapidly losing altitude.

3686
06:32:42,680 --> 06:32:44,680
He's at the shit.

3687
06:32:44,680 --> 06:32:48,680
You should just take his arm.

3688
06:32:48,680 --> 06:32:52,680
Do you need, can't you just like attach your arm back?

3689
06:32:52,680 --> 06:32:53,680
Oh.

3690
06:32:53,680 --> 06:33:10,680
The containment unit is too large to carry.

3691
06:33:10,680 --> 06:33:11,680
We must improvise.

3692
06:33:11,680 --> 06:33:16,680
Oh, what would you like to do?

3693
06:33:16,680 --> 06:33:18,680
Fucking hell, BT.

3694
06:33:18,680 --> 06:33:21,680
What are you doing?

3695
06:33:21,680 --> 06:33:23,680
BT, no.

3696
06:33:23,680 --> 06:33:25,680
I cannot reach the arm.

3697
06:33:25,680 --> 06:33:27,680
Cooper, I need your help.

3698
06:33:27,680 --> 06:33:29,680
I got you.

3699
06:33:29,680 --> 06:33:32,680
I'll grab it with my hands.

3700
06:33:32,680 --> 06:33:35,680
That doesn't seem like that's safe for me.

3701
06:33:35,680 --> 06:33:39,680
What do I do?

3702
06:33:39,680 --> 06:33:42,680
How, this doesn't really make any sense.

3703
06:33:42,680 --> 06:33:43,680
We need to get off the ship.

3704
06:33:43,680 --> 06:33:44,680
We are running out of time.

3705
06:33:44,680 --> 06:33:50,680
What am I, W?

3706
06:33:50,680 --> 06:33:55,680
What am I supposed to do?

3707
06:33:55,680 --> 06:33:57,680
I'm supposed to just keep holding W.

3708
06:33:57,680 --> 06:34:00,680
Sorry, I'm going Celestial.

3709
06:34:00,680 --> 06:34:03,680
This way, Cooper.

3710
06:34:03,680 --> 06:34:05,680
I'm dead.

3711
06:34:05,680 --> 06:34:07,680
BT, I'm clipping BT.

3712
06:34:07,680 --> 06:34:08,680
BT, help.

3713
06:34:08,680 --> 06:34:10,680
BT, I'm shaking.

3714
06:34:10,680 --> 06:34:11,680
BT.

3715
06:34:11,680 --> 06:34:14,680
What are you doing?

3716
06:34:14,680 --> 06:34:16,680
Protocol three.

3717
06:34:16,680 --> 06:34:18,680
BT, no.

3718
06:34:18,680 --> 06:34:20,680
Get the arc out of here.

3719
06:34:20,680 --> 06:34:22,680
Negative, we are trapped.

3720
06:34:22,680 --> 06:34:24,680
I will not lose another pilot.

3721
06:34:24,680 --> 06:34:25,680
BT.

3722
06:34:25,680 --> 06:34:27,680
Brace for impact.

3723
06:34:27,680 --> 06:34:28,680
BT.

3724
06:34:28,680 --> 06:34:31,680
I love you, BT.

3725
06:34:31,680 --> 06:34:32,680
I'm actually crying.

3726
06:34:32,680 --> 06:34:35,680
I'm not even joking.

3727
06:34:35,680 --> 06:34:43,680
BT.

3728
06:34:43,680 --> 06:34:46,680
BT.

3729
06:34:46,680 --> 06:34:49,680
BT.

3730
06:34:49,680 --> 06:34:54,680
I need a tissue.

3731
06:34:54,680 --> 06:34:57,680
I don't think I'm ready.

3732
06:34:57,680 --> 06:35:04,680
I forgot I was wearing mascara.

3733
06:35:04,680 --> 06:35:07,680
What the fuck?

3734
06:35:07,680 --> 06:35:12,680
I am fucking the both of you up.

3735
06:35:12,680 --> 06:35:22,680
What did you do to my boy?

3736
06:35:22,680 --> 06:35:27,680
Tell him Optimus.

3737
06:35:27,680 --> 06:35:29,680
I just grabbed his fucking hands.

3738
06:35:29,680 --> 06:35:34,680
I think it would be fine.

3739
06:35:34,680 --> 06:35:38,680
Where's my knife?

3740
06:35:38,680 --> 06:35:41,680
No.

3741
06:35:41,680 --> 06:35:42,680
What?

3742
06:35:42,680 --> 06:35:43,680
His feelings?

3743
06:35:43,680 --> 06:35:44,680
His feelings?

3744
06:35:44,680 --> 06:35:47,680
Get fucking got, bitch.

3745
06:35:47,680 --> 06:35:49,680
Nah, I'm just a smart ass motherfucker.

3746
06:35:49,680 --> 06:35:52,680
What the fuck are you wearing?

3747
06:35:52,680 --> 06:35:58,680
You're wearing a dumb ass outfit, bitch.

3748
06:35:58,680 --> 06:35:59,680
That's fine.

3749
06:35:59,680 --> 06:36:01,680
I'm ready to die.

3750
06:36:01,680 --> 06:36:25,680
No, BT, don't do it.

3751
06:36:25,680 --> 06:36:30,680
BT, don't do it.

3752
06:36:30,680 --> 06:36:32,680
Now open up.

3753
06:36:32,680 --> 06:36:35,680
I'm going to shoot your pilots in the head.

3754
06:36:35,680 --> 06:36:38,680
You still remember numbers, don't you?

3755
06:36:38,680 --> 06:36:40,680
I'm going to count to three.

3756
06:36:40,680 --> 06:36:43,680
No!

3757
06:36:43,680 --> 06:36:49,680
One, two, three.

3758
06:36:49,680 --> 06:36:52,680
Nah, that wasn't so hard, was it?

3759
06:36:52,680 --> 06:36:53,680
What the heck?

3760
06:36:53,680 --> 06:36:55,680
That's the problem with teams.

3761
06:36:55,680 --> 06:36:58,680
If you don't win together, you die together.

3762
06:36:58,680 --> 06:37:00,680
I'm going to shoot your pilots in the head.

3763
06:37:00,680 --> 06:37:02,680
I'll be grabbed you.

3764
06:37:02,680 --> 06:37:05,680
Yeah, yeah.

3765
06:37:05,680 --> 06:37:09,680
Get me up, get me up.

3766
06:37:09,680 --> 06:37:16,680
Kill all, BT.

3767
06:37:16,680 --> 06:37:25,680
No!

3768
06:37:26,680 --> 06:37:32,680
No!

3769
06:37:32,680 --> 06:37:34,680
I'm crying.

3770
06:37:34,680 --> 06:37:36,680
I hate this.

3771
06:37:36,680 --> 06:37:43,680
I know this was happening, but I hate this.

3772
06:37:43,680 --> 06:37:46,680
He was...

3773
06:37:46,680 --> 06:37:49,680
He was just a boy.

3774
06:37:49,680 --> 06:37:53,680
He was just a boy.

3775
06:37:53,680 --> 06:37:59,680
BT, no, I'm dying here with him.

3776
06:37:59,680 --> 06:38:02,680
I don't want to do it, no.

3777
06:38:02,680 --> 06:38:04,680
BT!

3778
06:38:04,680 --> 06:38:07,680
BT.

3779
06:38:07,680 --> 06:38:11,680
It's okay.

3780
06:38:11,680 --> 06:38:18,680
I can't do it without you.

3781
06:38:18,680 --> 06:38:20,680
What?

3782
06:38:20,680 --> 06:38:22,680
Your head?

3783
06:38:23,680 --> 06:38:28,680
What?

3784
06:38:28,680 --> 06:38:30,680
Don't worry, BT.

3785
06:38:30,680 --> 06:38:34,680
I'll take you with me.

3786
06:38:34,680 --> 06:38:36,680
A part of you will always live on.

3787
06:38:36,680 --> 06:38:38,680
What the...

3788
06:38:38,680 --> 06:38:55,680
Give me your eye.

3789
06:38:55,680 --> 06:39:03,680
Yeah, give that to me.

3790
06:39:03,680 --> 06:39:06,680
I'm going to fucking kill everybody.

3791
06:39:06,680 --> 06:39:10,680
I don't know where to go.

3792
06:39:10,680 --> 06:39:20,680
I can't fucking see.

3793
06:39:20,680 --> 06:39:22,680
I'm killing all of you.

3794
06:39:22,680 --> 06:39:29,680
Especially that fucking bitch, so...

3795
06:39:29,680 --> 06:39:31,680
I'm going to hold this gun right to your fucking head.

3796
06:39:31,680 --> 06:39:33,680
My game is lagging.

3797
06:39:33,680 --> 06:39:40,680
Oh, I totally forgot about this gun.

3798
06:39:40,680 --> 06:39:55,680
I'm fucking busy right now, killing bitches.

3799
06:39:55,680 --> 06:39:59,680
That's not where I'm supposed to go.

3800
06:39:59,680 --> 06:40:14,680
I can't really copy right now.

3801
06:40:14,680 --> 06:40:24,680
I don't know what a click is.

3802
06:40:24,680 --> 06:40:43,680
Are you fucking shitting me?

3803
06:40:43,680 --> 06:40:45,680
Shut up, game.

3804
06:40:45,680 --> 06:40:48,680
I'm so angry.

3805
06:40:48,680 --> 06:40:53,680
I know the gun doesn't for me.

3806
06:40:53,680 --> 06:41:18,680
It's just habit.

3807
06:41:18,680 --> 06:41:20,680
Oh, fuck.

3808
06:41:20,680 --> 06:41:23,680
Nope, I still fucked it up.

3809
06:41:23,680 --> 06:41:26,680
Don't worry about it.

3810
06:41:26,680 --> 06:41:28,680
I don't care about melees.

3811
06:41:28,680 --> 06:41:32,680
I'm shooting them all in the head.

3812
06:41:32,680 --> 06:41:39,680
For what they did to my boy.

3813
06:41:39,680 --> 06:41:41,680
It's hard to do this at the same time.

3814
06:41:41,680 --> 06:41:48,680
I'm not going to lie to you.

3815
06:41:48,680 --> 06:41:50,680
Oh, my God.

3816
06:41:50,680 --> 06:41:59,680
What the fuck?

3817
06:41:59,680 --> 06:42:12,680
Anyway.

3818
06:42:12,680 --> 06:42:17,680
It's kind of like such a weird thing to have at the end of the game.

3819
06:42:17,680 --> 06:42:24,680
Just like a gun that shoots for you.

3820
06:42:24,680 --> 06:42:29,680
It is a very satisfying revenge, I will say.

3821
06:42:29,680 --> 06:42:38,680
It's still very odd.

3822
06:42:38,680 --> 06:42:45,680
Oh, my God, the anti-guns.

3823
06:42:45,680 --> 06:42:57,680
I was chilling in his fucking head.

3824
06:42:57,680 --> 06:42:59,680
No.

3825
06:42:59,680 --> 06:43:02,680
I don't have a Titan.

3826
06:43:02,680 --> 06:43:04,680
My Titan's fucking dead.

3827
06:43:04,680 --> 06:43:06,680
Who are you?

3828
06:43:06,680 --> 06:43:07,680
Fs.

3829
06:43:07,680 --> 06:43:08,680
Okay.

3830
06:43:08,680 --> 06:43:10,680
Hi, Fs.

3831
06:43:10,680 --> 06:43:12,680
Oh.

3832
06:43:12,680 --> 06:43:14,680
BT, new body?

3833
06:43:14,680 --> 06:43:15,680
New body?

3834
06:43:15,680 --> 06:43:22,680
Who is this, BT?

3835
06:43:22,680 --> 06:43:27,680
Jack.

3836
06:43:27,680 --> 06:43:28,680
Not Cooper?

3837
06:43:28,680 --> 06:43:30,680
Okay, that's fine.

3838
06:43:30,680 --> 06:43:35,680
Ooh.

3839
06:43:35,680 --> 06:43:37,680
Okay, same day to core.

3840
06:43:37,680 --> 06:43:39,680
Fuck yeah.

3841
06:43:39,680 --> 06:43:41,680
Can I?

3842
06:43:41,680 --> 06:43:42,680
All right.

3843
06:43:42,680 --> 06:43:46,680
I cried for no reason, but it's fine.

3844
06:43:46,680 --> 06:43:50,680
Fuck you.

3845
06:43:50,680 --> 06:43:53,680
Ooh, I have a Gatling gun.

3846
06:43:53,680 --> 06:43:59,680
I have a Gatling gun, I don't know things.

3847
06:43:59,680 --> 06:44:00,680
Fuck off.

3848
06:44:00,680 --> 06:44:02,680
Excuse me, I'm angry.

3849
06:44:02,680 --> 06:44:03,680
I'm killing all of you.

3850
06:44:03,680 --> 06:44:07,680
Your murderous rampage.

3851
06:44:07,680 --> 06:44:09,680
Get absolutely mowed.

3852
06:44:09,680 --> 06:44:13,680
I don't even know what this is.

3853
06:44:13,680 --> 06:44:14,680
What is this do?

3854
06:44:14,680 --> 06:44:21,680
What am I doing?

3855
06:44:21,680 --> 06:44:30,680
Smart core.

3856
06:44:30,680 --> 06:44:33,680
Oh.

3857
06:44:33,680 --> 06:44:37,680
Fascinating.

3858
06:44:37,680 --> 06:44:40,680
Fascinating indeed.

3859
06:44:40,680 --> 06:44:46,680
All right.

3860
06:44:46,680 --> 06:44:49,680
Anybody else?

3861
06:44:49,680 --> 06:44:57,680
No, no, no, no, no, no.

3862
06:44:57,680 --> 06:45:01,680
Why do I feel like I can't do any, like, special things?

3863
06:45:01,680 --> 06:45:03,680
Oh, is that to be changing the type by now?

3864
06:45:03,680 --> 06:45:15,680
I don't know.

3865
06:45:15,680 --> 06:45:18,680
It's very satisfying.

3866
06:45:18,680 --> 06:45:23,680
Yeah, I'm trying my best out here.

3867
06:45:23,680 --> 06:45:26,680
Oh, yeah.

3868
06:45:26,680 --> 06:45:39,680
I am having a hard time doing anything right now, to be honest with you.

3869
06:45:39,680 --> 06:45:48,680
Sorry, it's a situation report.

3870
06:45:48,680 --> 06:45:55,680
Yeah, what does the G do?

3871
06:45:55,680 --> 06:45:59,680
I don't quite understand what I'm doing here when I press G.

3872
06:45:59,680 --> 06:46:03,680
Am I changing the bullet type?

3873
06:46:03,680 --> 06:46:14,680
It just disappeared.

3874
06:46:14,680 --> 06:46:15,680
Well, I'm sorry.

3875
06:46:15,680 --> 06:46:17,680
This tie-in is awkward.

3876
06:46:17,680 --> 06:46:18,680
What does this do?

3877
06:46:18,680 --> 06:46:24,680
It's like anti-altering, I don't know.

3878
06:46:24,680 --> 06:46:26,680
What's happening?

3879
06:46:26,680 --> 06:46:28,680
It's not really explaining what stuff does.

3880
06:46:28,680 --> 06:46:39,680
That's fine.

3881
06:46:39,680 --> 06:46:45,680
Oh, what is this?

3882
06:46:45,680 --> 06:46:49,680
Sorry, what?

3883
06:46:49,680 --> 06:46:53,680
The kill streak.

3884
06:46:53,680 --> 06:46:55,680
That's nice.

3885
06:46:55,680 --> 06:46:59,680
I'm having a good day.

3886
06:46:59,680 --> 06:47:08,680
You had to squish him, bros.

3887
06:47:08,680 --> 06:47:12,680
I did that with one hand, because I was scratching my eyebrow.

3888
06:47:12,680 --> 06:47:13,680
Stop.

3889
06:47:13,680 --> 06:47:17,680
You don't want to make me step on you.

3890
06:47:17,680 --> 06:47:21,680
There's my, uh, there it is.

3891
06:47:21,680 --> 06:47:31,680
I didn't mean to press it.

3892
06:47:31,680 --> 06:47:33,680
Stop punching me.

3893
06:47:33,680 --> 06:47:36,680
Oh, you're going to kill me.

3894
06:47:36,680 --> 06:47:37,680
I'm stuck.

3895
06:47:37,680 --> 06:47:42,680
I was in a corner.

3896
06:47:42,680 --> 06:47:43,680
Spread of fire rate.

3897
06:47:43,680 --> 06:47:45,680
Okay, that's what I thought.

3898
06:47:45,680 --> 06:47:46,680
I had a feeling.

3899
06:47:46,680 --> 06:47:48,680
Oh, I got to do this all again.

3900
06:47:48,680 --> 06:47:52,680
This isn't putting me in the fucking middle of it like before.

3901
06:47:52,680 --> 06:47:54,680
Great.

3902
06:47:54,680 --> 06:48:10,680
Yeah, Scorch, Scorch does, uh, Scorch does some shit to me, I realize.

3903
06:48:10,680 --> 06:48:13,680
At least I'm going to stop on all of y'all.

3904
06:48:13,680 --> 06:48:23,680
Let me back up.

3905
06:48:23,680 --> 06:48:24,680
Oh, okay.

3906
06:48:24,680 --> 06:48:25,680
I didn't really have to do anything.

3907
06:48:25,680 --> 06:48:46,680
I never get that they help me.

3908
06:48:46,680 --> 06:48:51,680
Okay, let me just step on some dudes because they're kind of being annoying.

3909
06:48:51,680 --> 06:49:07,680
I'm literally being fucking shot on.

3910
06:49:07,680 --> 06:49:16,680
Try to stop this laser.

3911
06:49:16,680 --> 06:49:21,680
Oh, okay, nice.

3912
06:49:21,680 --> 06:49:24,680
Okay, I'm backing up for this fucking Scorch, dude.

3913
06:49:24,680 --> 06:49:27,680
I need to, because I got back to a corner.

3914
06:49:27,680 --> 06:49:31,680
Stupid reasons.

3915
06:49:31,680 --> 06:49:37,680
I know how to finish.

3916
06:49:37,680 --> 06:49:40,680
Oh, maybe a triple.

3917

Let me shoot you.

3919
06:49:45,680 --> 06:49:48,680
It takes me a while to do the fucking animation.

3920
06:49:48,680 --> 06:49:53,680
Jesus.

3921
06:49:53,680 --> 06:49:59,680
You have something that I need.

3922
06:49:59,680 --> 06:50:00,680
You look lonely.

3923
06:50:00,680 --> 06:50:13,680

3924
06:50:13,680 --> 06:50:15,680

Okay, thank you.

3927
06:50:18,680 --> 06:50:20,680

3931
06:50:23,680 --> 06:50:25,680

3935
06:50:42,680 --> 06:50:51,680

06:50:52,680 --> 06:50:55,680
I don't even know.

3937
06:50:55,680 --> 06:50:57,680
That was not me.

3938
06:50:57,680 --> 06:50:59,680
That was weird.

3939
06:50:59,680 --> 06:51:02,680

3940
06:51:02,680 --> 06:51:04,680
Target's locked.

3941
06:51:04,680 --> 06:51:07,680

06:52:22,280 --> 06:52:24,280

I don't work for free

4011
07:02:21,320 --> 07:02:23,320
But

4026
07:03:48,040 --> 07:03:52,440
I can't do it. I can't deal with this emotional stress

4027
07:04:04,440 --> 07:04:09,800
I'm holding w just in case because I don't know what's happening. We're just killing ourselves

4028
07:04:10,680 --> 07:04:12,680

07:04:21,000 --> 07:04:27,160
I know that goes against her programming, but protocol three protect the pilot

4031
07:04:29,800 --> 07:04:32,680
No, I knew we were gonna fucking do this

4032
07:04:33,640 --> 07:04:35,640
I

4033
07:04:47,800 --> 07:04:50,360
Like I remember this happening and it still hurts

4034
07:04:57,560 --> 07:04:59,560
No, I'm killing myself

4035
07:05:00,520 --> 07:05:02,520
I can't do this

4036
07:05:09,000 --> 07:05:11,000
I need a tissue

4037
07:05:14,200 --> 07:05:17,400
I knew it was coming like I forget that they like

4038
07:05:19,400 --> 07:05:22,440
I do remember this part and it's annoying as fuck

4039
07:05:23,160 --> 07:05:26,760

07:05:44,040 --> 07:05:48,040
I don't even know where I'm running to see you know what I don't even have a will to live

4042
07:05:48,040 --> 07:05:50,040
I

4043
07:05:50,280 --> 07:05:54,920
Pull up to call because that's what to say. Oh, yeah, I'll protect the pilot. Oh, just kidding

4044
07:05:59,480 --> 07:06:04,120
Don't tell strong you play this game because she'll cry she'll cry harder than I am

4045
07:06:09,320 --> 07:06:12,520
What the I can't even tell what's happening

4046
07:06:18,280 --> 07:06:20,440
I'm jumping for it

4047
07:06:22,920 --> 07:06:24,600
How

4048
07:06:24,600 --> 07:06:26,840
Thanks ugly makeup lady you look like

4049
07:06:28,200 --> 07:06:30,780
You have very bad concealer under your eyes

4050
07:06:32,200 --> 07:06:36,120
I do like the like the black Korean glass skin look you're going for though

4051
07:06:38,280 --> 07:06:40,280
Oh my god

4052
07:06:41,240 --> 07:06:43,240
So bt died for nothing

4053
07:06:43,960 --> 07:06:45,960
I

4054
07:06:47,560 --> 07:06:50,280
That's what you're telling me right that bt died for nothing

4055
07:06:53,720 --> 07:06:59,480
Because a planet still exploded pilot cooper a lot of people owe their lives to you

4056
07:07:00,920 --> 07:07:03,560
And to bt shut up. You don't get to say his name

4057
07:07:04,680 --> 07:07:08,440
Set a course for harmony. Take us home. You got it

4058
07:07:13,960 --> 07:07:21,560
That's right. That's right. His core just stabilized it. So it exploded the planet the destruction of typhans saved the planet harmony

4059
07:07:22,680 --> 07:07:24,840
The militia calls this planet their headquarters

4060
07:07:25,480 --> 07:07:27,480
The millions of others call it home

4061
07:07:28,120 --> 07:07:32,760
Like how it's mostly green so the blue be inducted into the marauder core and assigned a new titan

4062
07:07:33,720 --> 07:07:39,640
After the tax wipe what's left of my neural link with bt. I don't care. No, I don't know what that'll feel like

4063
07:07:40,200 --> 07:07:42,200
to get assigned a new titan

4064
07:07:42,920 --> 07:07:44,920
I kind of like the old one

4065
07:07:47,960 --> 07:07:50,520
This is pilot jack cooper signing off

4066
07:07:53,240 --> 07:07:56,040
Matt Mercer the fact you weren't fucking balling in the stew

4067
07:07:59,160 --> 07:08:01,160
Such a great fucking campaign

4068
07:08:04,440 --> 07:08:06,440
I'm the second vtb to come

4069
07:08:13,000 --> 07:08:16,760
Oh, wow, they actually fucking show him

4070
07:08:20,120 --> 07:08:22,120
Why does he look latino

4071
07:08:27,800 --> 07:08:29,800
Don't dapp her up

4072
07:08:31,480 --> 07:08:33,400
She literally looks like

4073
07:08:33,400 --> 07:08:35,400
stereotypical

4074
07:08:35,800 --> 07:08:40,680
Uh, what's that fucking amazing like that famous poster? It's like

4075
07:08:41,640 --> 07:08:45,400
Women for the army poster like something. Oh, I forgot her name

4076
07:08:46,440 --> 07:08:48,440
It literally looks like her

4077
07:08:48,440 --> 07:08:51,000
Looks like mirage. Uh, no

4078
07:08:52,280 --> 07:08:58,280
Does not look like mirage at all. Oh, I thought you meant her. Yes. He actually kind of does look like mirage. You're not wrong

4079
07:08:59,320 --> 07:09:02,040
I didn't say anything's wrong with latinos. I said he looks latino

4080
07:09:03,960 --> 07:09:06,840
They're all just mirage. This is all just this is all mirage

4081
07:09:07,160 --> 07:09:10,520
Yes, rosy rivets

4082
07:09:13,800 --> 07:09:15,800
I'm so upset

4083
07:09:19,560 --> 07:09:21,800
Yes, she did like why is he celebrating

4084
07:09:23,000 --> 07:09:28,840
I would be so torn in the emotional attachment. I formed with a robot in the span of a couple hours

4085
07:09:31,480 --> 07:09:34,280
The more I look at him the more it looks like a mirage with a different haircut

4086
07:09:37,320 --> 07:09:39,320
I

4087
07:09:42,440 --> 07:09:44,840
Actually think it's the same model except the different haircut

4088
07:09:49,080 --> 07:09:52,520
Technically a part of bt's core. Yeah, that's what I mean because he still has the gun

4089
07:09:53,400 --> 07:09:57,800
And he still has the helmet and everything and they have to wipe his neural link

4090
07:09:57,960 --> 07:10:01,720
And so that's why it's obviously showing like oh bt lives on in the helm. Wait

4091
07:10:03,240 --> 07:10:06,040
Excuse me. What? Okay. So yeah bt's still alive

4092
07:10:07,000 --> 07:10:09,000
Thank you optimus. You're amazing

4093
07:10:19,400 --> 07:10:21,400
Right the game of

4094
07:10:22,840 --> 07:10:27,880
Oh my god, it's rockamos. He's dead. He had like five seconds of screen time

4095
07:10:32,120 --> 07:10:35,560
Um music production 10 out of 10 voice acting

4096
07:10:37,000 --> 07:10:38,600
8 out of 10

4097
07:10:38,600 --> 07:10:40,600
uh game overall

4098
07:10:41,400 --> 07:10:43,400
Because it has such a soft spot in my heart

4099
07:10:44,040 --> 07:10:47,240
Go away. I cannot stand your face. Um

4100
07:10:50,840 --> 07:10:55,560
I would say a year and all mommy. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes

4101
07:10:56,600 --> 07:10:58,600
I will vote about your twitter

4102
07:10:59,160 --> 07:11:00,840
your

4103
07:11:00,840 --> 07:11:02,840
Character design is honestly really cool

4104
07:11:02,920 --> 07:11:04,840
Like I like canes

4105
07:11:04,840 --> 07:11:06,840
Design of his Titan

4106
07:11:07,880 --> 07:11:14,340
Thank you again for another 10 gifted Ray kuma. Oh my god dropping them like it's hot this motherfucker

4107
07:11:17,720 --> 07:11:19,760
Make sure you say thank you if you got something

4108
07:11:21,160 --> 07:11:23,160
Thank you. Thank you

4109
07:11:25,000 --> 07:11:29,440
Overall I also yeah, the vipers. I think vipers is actually my favorite

4110
07:11:30,120 --> 07:11:35,840
The enemy titans are so fucking cool fuck Sloan

4111
07:11:37,720 --> 07:11:40,220
Poor derogatory

4112
07:11:42,920 --> 07:11:44,920
I

4113
07:11:45,680 --> 07:11:48,820
Would say time falls like an 8 out of 10 for me

4114
07:11:49,960 --> 07:11:57,200
Just because like I like when it first came out like it was a 10 out of 10 like but it's falling from grace and EA's ruined everything

4115
07:11:59,440 --> 07:12:01,440
I

4116
07:12:04,920 --> 07:12:10,080
Just a guy that likes to fight. I don't know. I was he like for hire. I

4117
07:12:12,080 --> 07:12:16,600
Like kind of like the halo reach team we had fucking have a

4118
07:12:18,320 --> 07:12:23,080
Little little destiny squad me squatting up with the boys. He's like come on

4119
07:12:24,040 --> 07:12:28,040
I'm Davis. Come on, bro. Come on cameraman. Follow us

4120
07:12:30,320 --> 07:12:36,160
It's like cod the cod squad I am seething

4121
07:12:40,800 --> 07:12:42,800
Who are you I don't remember you

4122
07:12:48,680 --> 07:12:51,560
Who else does Yuri lo and fall voice

4123
07:12:52,160 --> 07:12:54,160
I

4124
07:12:55,920 --> 07:13:01,520
Be so cool to just be a rando and PC I'd be like

4125
07:13:05,920 --> 07:13:07,920
Playing tight it was pretty damn sick

4126
07:13:09,040 --> 07:13:11,040
Yeah

4127
07:13:12,160 --> 07:13:16,120
Her daughter, what do you mean? I don't know the lore of

4128
07:13:16,400 --> 07:13:19,680
Of time fall everyone only play the game for the game

4129
07:13:19,680 --> 07:13:24,320
I never pay attention to the lore like I do now for games like if I was like Ellen ring

4130
07:13:24,320 --> 07:13:28,480
I'd be like what's going like I'm probably actually gonna watch a whole war video about time and fall after this

4131
07:13:30,480 --> 07:13:32,480
Just so you know

4132
07:13:36,200 --> 07:13:43,760
I'm yeah, like I don't know like they would like EA would make even more money if they dropped Titanfall 3

4133
07:13:43,760 --> 07:13:48,960
I don't understand what's going through their heads that they won't do it. I'm still crying

4134
07:13:50,880 --> 07:13:54,000
Like it doesn't like they're we all know they love money

4135
07:13:54,720 --> 07:13:56,720
They'll make even more

4136
07:13:56,720 --> 07:14:01,360
If they dropped Titanfall 3 just let respawn do what they need to do

4137
07:14:04,600 --> 07:14:08,160
Well, I don't know any of that stuff. I don't know anything about apex anymore

4138
07:14:08,160 --> 07:14:11,760
I only played when it first came out for like a couple of months

4139
07:14:12,760 --> 07:14:16,760
Excuse me, and I I I mained bloodhound

4140
07:14:21,400 --> 07:14:24,560
Valkyrie is Viper's daughter. Yeah, but I don't know who Valkyrie is

4141
07:14:25,800 --> 07:14:31,320
Is that a character in apex? I don't know I haven't played apex and like I got on apex

4142
07:14:31,320 --> 07:14:37,280
I think also like a year ago. I played one match and I was like nah, I'm good

4143
07:14:38,200 --> 07:14:40,200
I'm okay

4144
07:14:41,880 --> 07:14:49,160
Respawn are the ones that don't want to make Titanfall 3 too bad. Do it anyways me a vtuber who you don't know or have any

4145
07:14:50,720 --> 07:14:57,000
Loven affection for is telling you to do so because it would make a lot of people's childhood. Please respawn

4146
07:14:57,000 --> 07:15:01,400
I'm begging you. I use so much. I want to take in fall 3 game

4147
07:15:01,520 --> 07:15:12,560
Okay, Viper has a daughter's one of the legends apex with the name of Valkyrie and that's what she did was copy your father's Titan design

4148
07:15:16,840 --> 07:15:23,400
Coping so hard. What do you mean? I'm not cool. I'm shit at the game. I don't I never I never said I was good at apex

4149
07:15:24,120 --> 07:15:29,680
When it first came out. Yeah, because I like I'm always very good at games when they first came out like when fortnight came out

4150
07:15:29,680 --> 07:15:30,880
I was good

4151
07:15:30,880 --> 07:15:34,840
But rainbow came out. Actually, no, that's a lie. I never did. I never really played rainbow

4152
07:15:36,280 --> 07:15:39,560
I think CS was one of the only games I like

4153
07:15:40,240 --> 07:15:44,800
Started obviously like to see us like my dad has been fucking playing CS go. I'm sorry. Just smack the mic

4154
07:15:47,960 --> 07:15:51,960
I'm here. Sorry Rena jumped to my arms. Hi

4155
07:15:53,600 --> 07:15:55,600
Are you trying to calm me down?

4156
07:15:55,760 --> 07:15:57,760
I'm getting so he did

4157
07:16:00,520 --> 07:16:02,520
Um, oh

4158
07:16:02,800 --> 07:16:04,800
Yeah, I am yes

4159
07:16:05,800 --> 07:16:11,440
I you know, yeah, I think they all disbanded. I think respawn is all I don't think respawn's the company that

4160
07:16:12,640 --> 07:16:14,640
That it was before

4161
07:16:14,640 --> 07:16:16,880
I'm pretty much the mic times do

4162
07:16:20,480 --> 07:16:23,600
Who knows there's I heard there's rumors of a half-life 3 so

4163
07:16:25,920 --> 07:16:27,920
Frontier defense isn't leaving me myself

4164
07:16:30,640 --> 07:16:33,640
Perfectly fine. I'm not I

4165
07:16:34,720 --> 07:16:36,720
disagree

4166
07:16:37,040 --> 07:16:39,040
Highly disagree. I

4167
07:16:39,520 --> 07:16:43,280
Think a third installment would wrap it up very nicely

4168
07:16:45,680 --> 07:16:50,640
Yeah, right, yeah, cuz didn't the didn't respawn technically close and they're just using the name and the branding

4169
07:16:54,240 --> 07:16:56,240
Hello, welcome

4170
07:16:56,480 --> 07:16:58,480
Beach he's alive

4171
07:16:58,800 --> 07:17:00,800
Pilot pilot come in

4172
07:17:04,720 --> 07:17:06,720
What does he fucking possess the helmet? Oh my god

4173
07:17:08,880 --> 07:17:11,200
Even my cats. Oh, yeah, no, Rena always usually um

4174
07:17:12,240 --> 07:17:17,200
Checks on me when I get like stressed out. She's my girl. I motion or support kitty. Yeah

4175
07:17:18,880 --> 07:17:20,880
Yeah

4176
07:17:20,960 --> 07:17:22,960
Emotion or support kitty

4177
07:17:23,760 --> 07:17:25,760
Oh

4178
07:17:26,400 --> 07:17:32,000
The Morse code read does jack jack. Are you there? Oh, that's funny. I think I remember seeing that somewhere

4179
07:17:32,800 --> 07:17:35,120
Ever gone about that. Have a good night. Bye. Bye

4180
07:17:36,880 --> 07:17:38,880
She says

4181
07:17:39,760 --> 07:17:43,200
Become a multiplayer that'll kill TFG's multiplayer. What are you?

4182
07:17:45,520 --> 07:17:51,680
But it will just be even a better multiplayer. Let's let's see multiplayer. Let's see how bad I am

4183
07:17:52,640 --> 07:17:56,240
Ignore that my wait. No, I actually know it shouldn't be my

4184
07:17:58,400 --> 07:18:04,240
Oh, I'll see if it's we'll see what name it shows. Don't add me. I'm not gonna add you back. Sorry kids

4185
07:18:10,640 --> 07:18:12,640
What

4186
07:18:15,040 --> 07:18:17,040
What the fuck is this

4187
07:18:17,760 --> 07:18:19,760
I

4188
07:18:20,160 --> 07:18:22,160
Don't even know what the fuck is happening

4189
07:18:24,240 --> 07:18:31,680
Again, I played Titanfall one mostly I've played the campaign of Titanfall two multiple times

4190
07:18:37,280 --> 07:18:39,280
I

4191
07:18:40,640 --> 07:18:42,640
Is that the cloak I don't

4192
07:18:42,880 --> 07:18:44,880
Know what I'm looking at

4193
07:18:46,000 --> 07:18:49,680
Multiplayer is pretty all right as high chance to counter crack players. You never put down the game

4194
07:18:50,560 --> 07:18:52,560
me no, I'm kidding. Um

4195
07:18:56,720 --> 07:18:58,720
Fuck a spitfire

4196
07:19:01,360 --> 07:19:08,160
Let's just do that. Why would I want a charge rifle? Can I change that? Do I have to pick one?

4197
07:19:08,160 --> 07:19:10,160
Oh

4198
07:19:11,520 --> 07:19:13,520
That's right because you need the anti Titan

4199
07:19:14,240 --> 07:19:19,440
That's right. I prefer fuck. I can't get it. It costs money. Oh wait, I have

4200
07:19:20,640 --> 07:19:22,640
Nobody look at my name

4201
07:19:24,640 --> 07:19:26,640
Um

4202
07:19:26,640 --> 07:19:28,640
Can I buy it? Oh

4203
07:19:29,600 --> 07:19:31,600
Does that level it up if I

4204
07:19:32,480 --> 07:19:34,480
Does that level it up if I

4205
07:19:37,120 --> 07:19:40,960
Unlocks the level 32 the wingman's the best fucking

4206
07:19:42,480 --> 07:19:48,160
Gone in the game. Uh, whatever. I don't nobody look at my name shut up. Um

4207
07:19:53,280 --> 07:19:56,560
If you add me I will block your ass I can be female

4208
07:19:57,120 --> 07:20:02,480
I don't oh, I'm just I'm just a twink. All right, that's fine. Uh

4209
07:20:03,920 --> 07:20:05,920
neckbreaker

4210
07:20:08,080 --> 07:20:15,520
Grand theft seven what no, I want to see what it looks like. Don't I do they not offer previews like fucking apex?

4211
07:20:19,280 --> 07:20:25,360
Wait, I can change the color. Hold on. Is that like the skins? Can I please edit stuff?

4212
07:20:27,200 --> 07:20:29,200
Grapple

4213
07:20:29,680 --> 07:20:31,600
cloak

4214
07:20:31,600 --> 07:20:33,360
tactical

4215
07:20:33,360 --> 07:20:36,560
Oh, I did because I remember I did like that because bloodhound and shit

4216
07:20:38,000 --> 07:20:42,160
I do remember using the grapple. I remember. Okay. I do remember some of these

4217
07:20:46,240 --> 07:20:48,240
This is just mirage

4218
07:20:49,280 --> 07:20:53,040
I'll stick with the grapple because I'm stupid. Uh, let's see what we got

4219
07:20:53,600 --> 07:21:01,920
The ugliest skins known to man. What about some like cool shit, but the super expensive stuff ugly ugly ugly. Wow. These are

4220
07:21:03,280 --> 07:21:05,280
Disgusting

4221
07:21:06,000 --> 07:21:08,000
That's pretty neat

4222
07:21:10,560 --> 07:21:17,680
I'm not spending my whatever coins I have on this though. I'm not doing that. Um, I don't know what these blocked

4223
07:21:18,080 --> 07:21:20,080
Oh mods

4224
07:21:20,160 --> 07:21:22,160
I don't care

4225
07:21:23,840 --> 07:21:25,840
I know skins equals wins

4226
07:21:31,920 --> 07:21:36,320
Do you guys want to hop in do you guys want to play multiplayer?

4227
07:21:38,720 --> 07:21:40,720

I don't know what that means. I don't know what an advocate gift is

4232
07:22:02,240 --> 07:22:05,600
I'm an advocate. I don't know. Uh, who am I advocating for?

4233
07:22:11,440 --> 07:22:15,920

I'll play one Titanfall multiplayer game and then I'll play one apex game

4250
07:23:43,760 --> 07:23:45,760
Can I just play attrition?

4251
07:23:47,280 --> 07:23:49,280
Can I

4252
07:23:53,600 --> 07:23:55,600

4257
07:24:30,960 --> 07:24:32,960

07:29:33,760 --> 07:29:35,760

4290
07:29:39,280 --> 07:29:41,280
Oh

4291
07:30:09,600 --> 07:30:11,600

4294
07:30:40,240 --> 07:30:42,240

07:31:02,400 --> 07:31:06,000
Ah, oh rena you fucking clogged my tip

4296
07:31:10,240 --> 07:31:12,240
Oh

4297
07:31:17,680 --> 07:31:20,960
Oh, it's my time it's my time guys, it's my time

4298
07:31:39,600 --> 07:31:41,600
Oh

4299
07:32:00,480 --> 07:32:02,480
Where did my team go

4300
07:32:09,280 --> 07:32:11,280
All right

4301
07:32:12,560 --> 07:32:14,560
All right

4302
07:32:26,800 --> 07:32:29,600
They're just wrongs I want an accurate person

4303
07:32:39,520 --> 07:32:41,520
No

4304
07:32:49,520 --> 07:32:52,480
Yes, I know I'm not using any of my stuff I could be using

4305
07:32:54,560 --> 07:32:56,560
I'm killing myself

4306
07:32:58,720 --> 07:33:04,800
And I just quit can I leave I'm already done. I don't want to do this anymore. Ah, you scared me

4307
07:33:10,240 --> 07:33:12,240
Terrified

4308
07:33:16,080 --> 07:33:18,080
I have zero kills

4309
07:33:26,720 --> 07:33:29,440
Not so sure I didn't mean to throw that

4310
07:33:32,000 --> 07:33:34,000
I meant to do this

4311
07:33:34,160 --> 07:33:39,680
I know most of the fight. Oh my god. What am I doing?

4312
07:33:56,880 --> 07:34:00,640
This is a start to me being an amazing Titanfall player

4313
07:34:01,040 --> 07:34:03,040
And

4314
07:34:05,680 --> 07:34:09,200
Everybody will want to hang out with me. Oh no

4315
07:34:18,160 --> 07:34:21,280
I'm just gonna sit here for the rest of this stuff. I haven't killed one person

4316
07:34:23,760 --> 07:34:26,480
I told you I wasn't I'm not good at yes these guys

4317
07:34:28,560 --> 07:34:30,560
Someone saw me

4318
07:34:30,720 --> 07:34:32,720
Oh

4319
07:34:36,800 --> 07:34:41,040
All I hear are Titans. Oh, this is a bad idea

4320
07:34:42,640 --> 07:34:48,480
Oh, what are you doing? Oh, they were trying to knife me. That's not nice

4321
07:34:55,120 --> 07:34:59,440
I got one kill guys are you proud because they were trying to creep up on me because I'm bad

4322
07:35:01,120 --> 07:35:03,120
I don't really know

4323
07:35:08,720 --> 07:35:10,720
I see people

4324
07:35:12,640 --> 07:35:15,760
Am I good enough to kill them? It's feasible

4325
07:35:25,120 --> 07:35:27,120
What

4326
07:35:31,440 --> 07:35:33,440
Oh

4327
07:35:35,040 --> 07:35:42,560
I wanted manically the top 20% with one player. So yeah, it's my time. I'm gonna kill these guys

4328
07:35:49,120 --> 07:35:51,120
Is there a dude behind me?

4329
07:35:53,600 --> 07:35:55,600
Oh no

4330
07:36:01,600 --> 07:36:03,600
Most

4331
07:36:06,160 --> 07:36:14,000
Bro, I always hate when they land your Titan and kill you with a Titan. I was backed into a fucking corner

4332
07:36:23,200 --> 07:36:25,620
That's a fucking specter. That's why I'm able to hit it

4333
07:36:30,880 --> 07:36:38,400
Is there like actual people I can fight?

4334
07:36:41,200 --> 07:36:45,760
No, not a Titan. No, I'm stuck in there again

4335
07:36:45,760 --> 07:36:47,760
I

4336
07:37:03,600 --> 07:37:05,600
Think I carried that bro

4337
07:37:09,680 --> 07:37:11,680
I think I carried that bro

4338
07:37:12,640 --> 07:37:15,440
I slip into my doki impression. What are you talking about?

4339
07:37:16,960 --> 07:37:24,080
It's all right. I'm gonna redeem myself with apex. No, I'm not. It's gonna be worse. Let's let's try. Let's try one match

4340
07:37:24,960 --> 07:37:26,960
one match

4341
07:37:27,280 --> 07:37:29,280
One match

4342
07:37:29,360 --> 07:37:31,920
Can I what the fuck am I looking at?

4343
07:37:41,680 --> 07:37:43,680
I

4344
07:37:50,480 --> 07:37:52,480
Let's try let's

4345
07:37:54,320 --> 07:37:56,320
Let's try

4346
07:37:56,320 --> 07:37:58,320
My voice slips into it

4347
07:37:58,480 --> 07:38:00,480
Does it I don't mean to

4348
07:38:00,720 --> 07:38:04,720
Because my voice does like get to the back of my throat and a little bit nasally when I'm

4349
07:38:05,920 --> 07:38:08,000
Like playing games sometimes. Um

4350
07:38:08,960 --> 07:38:13,840
Again, my voice changes a lot. Oh, it's got a shiver

4351
07:38:16,800 --> 07:38:20,240
Apex legends

4352
07:38:24,080 --> 07:38:30,400
Except I have to download the game. I swear it's already downloaded

4353
07:38:32,320 --> 07:38:34,320
Can I just

4354
07:38:35,120 --> 07:38:37,120
Huh all right

4355
07:38:38,560 --> 07:38:40,560
How long is this gonna take?

4356
07:38:41,360 --> 07:38:43,360
55 minutes

4357
07:38:44,960 --> 07:38:46,960
Okay, it's going down

4358
07:38:48,480 --> 07:38:53,760
Yeah, thanks Franks for hanging up. Yeah, I was just I was just a warm-up guys. I was just a warm-up

4359
07:38:55,440 --> 07:38:57,440
It was just a warm-up, you know

4360
07:39:00,480 --> 07:39:06,480
I'm pretty I'm pretty cool with it right rena rena's impressed with my with my prowess. I killed that one guy

4361
07:39:06,720 --> 07:39:08,720
Did you see that?

4362
07:39:09,680 --> 07:39:11,680
I killed I killed a top frag

4363
07:39:12,720 --> 07:39:16,320
I don't know if he was top frag. I killed I killed a man

4364
07:39:17,760 --> 07:39:24,880
My model is lagging because I'm downloading stuff and it's it's saying it's taking 30 minutes, but it's going down

4365
07:39:26,320 --> 07:39:28,320
It just went up to 30 again

4366
07:39:29,040 --> 07:39:31,040
um

4367
07:39:31,600 --> 07:39:35,760
This is a bad idea. I thought I already had this installed

4368
07:39:45,120 --> 07:39:47,760
Okay, we're not we're not we're not doing this

4369
07:39:54,560 --> 07:39:57,440
Why can't I send messages my own fucking stream?

4370
07:40:01,280 --> 07:40:03,280
Oh queen

4371
07:40:04,480 --> 07:40:11,600
Oh god. Oh, I didn't mean to close my own. I I'm gone now. I accidentally closed vtube studio

4372
07:40:12,800 --> 07:40:14,800
My back. Hello

4373
07:40:16,160 --> 07:40:18,160
Guys

4374
07:40:18,160 --> 07:40:21,280
Am I still here? Hold on. I gotta reload

4375
07:40:32,000 --> 07:40:35,680
Everything's explode. Hello. Oh, there I am

4376
07:40:36,720 --> 07:40:38,720
Just

4377
07:40:39,200 --> 07:40:43,360
Staring at you. All right. That was a bad idea. We're not doing that. Um

4378
07:40:47,760 --> 07:40:52,240
Yeah, like one guy was trying to execute me because he knew how bad I was so that's fine

4379
07:40:52,240 --> 07:40:57,760
Uh, I'm a time pulp fault pro make sure you spread that so I get invited to tournaments and stuff

4380
07:40:58,000 --> 07:41:01,520
And then people can see how wonderful I am at tinefall

4381
07:41:02,400 --> 07:41:07,680
Uh, didn't touch the game for a year and I was already top frag. So it's pretty crazy

4382
07:41:08,000 --> 07:41:12,480
How I just have that like natural FPS touch, you know

4383
07:41:13,760 --> 07:41:15,760
Um

4384
07:41:16,400 --> 07:41:18,400
I'm gone

4385
07:41:19,520 --> 07:41:21,520
Oh, I think there's latency now

4386
07:41:22,800 --> 07:41:25,040
I think there's a lot of latency now

4387
07:41:25,040 --> 07:41:27,040
latency now

4388
07:41:27,280 --> 07:41:29,840
Uh guys, I'm still here guys

4389
07:41:31,360 --> 07:41:38,080
Oh my god, there's okay. There's like a 10 second delay. I think guys refresh the stream refresh the stream, please

4390
07:41:39,440 --> 07:41:41,440
Refresh it

4391
07:41:45,920 --> 07:41:47,920
I'm scratching my eye

4392
07:41:49,520 --> 07:41:51,520
Uh

4393
07:41:52,240 --> 07:41:56,000
What time is it? I want to play Elden Ring. I didn't think I'd

4394
07:41:59,440 --> 07:42:01,440
It's slowly catching up to life

4395
07:42:04,080 --> 07:42:06,080
Well

4396
07:42:06,560 --> 07:42:10,000
Maybe I should just end stream. Maybe this is a sign that I should just end it all

4397
07:42:11,040 --> 07:42:12,960
on stream

4398
07:42:12,960 --> 07:42:14,960
in tinefall

4399
07:42:15,200 --> 07:42:17,200
Uh

4400
07:42:17,440 --> 07:42:22,240
I am MLG contender, you know, I have been scouted by like phase cloud nine

4401
07:42:23,280 --> 07:42:25,280
liquid

4402
07:42:25,360 --> 07:42:27,360
you know

4403
07:42:29,600 --> 07:42:36,240
Trying to think of more places I'm a sort of mythic mythic talent

4404
07:42:36,960 --> 07:42:38,960
um

4405
07:42:39,280 --> 07:42:41,280
Uh

4406
07:42:42,800 --> 07:42:46,560
But uh, yeah, I'm a I'm a pretty pro player

4407
07:42:47,120 --> 07:42:53,520
Uh fanatic precisely if ESPO is just waiting to snatch me up. Sadly, my heart is taken by veeler

4408
07:42:53,600 --> 07:42:55,120
It's not gonna happen

4409
07:42:55,120 --> 07:42:58,480
But you know, they they tried they tried their best to get me

4410
07:42:58,800 --> 07:43:02,320
Uh, because I'm a very sought after FPS player

4411
07:43:03,920 --> 07:43:07,200
But um, but yeah, it's just it's just not a phase bun

4412
07:43:07,600 --> 07:43:13,760
It's just not that, you know, the way the cookie crumbles. I'm playing like I'm petting rena's paws. Her paws are so soft

4413
07:43:13,840 --> 07:43:15,840
Oh my god, your paws are so soft

4414
07:43:16,320 --> 07:43:18,320
Your little toe beans rena

4415
07:43:20,960 --> 07:43:22,960
Um

4416
07:43:23,680 --> 07:43:28,640
I was uh, yeah, yeah, I finished time fall too. I'm just talking about how wonderful I am at streaming

4417
07:43:29,280 --> 07:43:32,880
Um, it's the FPS is I'm gonna have to get my reps up

4418
07:43:33,760 --> 07:43:35,760
If I'm telling you

4419
07:43:38,160 --> 07:43:43,840
I was good once. I mean, I'm great now, but I was good once, you know, we all take steps

4420
07:43:44,720 --> 07:43:49,360
To like figure out where we are in life and try to figure out

4421
07:43:50,560 --> 07:43:52,240
You know

4422
07:43:52,240 --> 07:43:57,200
Ourselves in our play. I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. Uh, let's try let me find somebody to read

4423
07:43:57,600 --> 07:44:00,400
I have I just have people like leaving I get

4424
07:44:02,560 --> 07:44:06,320
I just see my view count going down as I'm fucking rambling

4425
07:44:06,800 --> 07:44:08,800
Um, I don't know

4426
07:44:12,960 --> 07:44:17,200
Where is why isn't letting me edit. Oh, it signed me out

4427
07:44:19,520 --> 07:44:21,520
Of youtube what the fuck

4428
07:44:23,920 --> 07:44:25,920
Why did it sign me out

4429
07:44:28,800 --> 07:44:31,600
Hold on I have to log back in

4430
07:44:32,480 --> 07:44:34,480
I

4431
07:44:35,280 --> 07:44:37,280
Hate it here

4432
07:44:44,720 --> 07:44:48,000
I'm here guys. I'm here

4433
07:44:53,440 --> 07:44:55,440
Wait did it end stream

4434
07:45:02,000 --> 07:45:06,480
Did it just end stream the stream just die

4435
07:45:09,600 --> 07:45:14,320
I will literally cry if stream just ended

4436
07:45:16,800 --> 07:45:20,880
Okay, no, it didn't okay, it's okay. I got scared

4437
07:45:22,560 --> 07:45:24,800
I have to be like I can't handle this now

4438
07:45:25,440 --> 07:45:27,680
Right now your paws are so nice you show off

4439
07:45:28,480 --> 07:45:32,080
Okay, so who do we got we got

4440
07:45:33,040 --> 07:45:36,960
Mercy is playing chain together with some girly pops

4441
07:45:38,080 --> 07:45:40,080
Uh, let me just read mercy

4442
07:45:41,280 --> 07:45:47,040
And uh go have fun with mercy. She's playing with uh, me akumia

4443
07:45:48,240 --> 07:45:54,560
Uh, I forget where she's from. I can't remember if she's from an agency or not. Um, I like that. She's playing

4444
07:45:54,560 --> 07:45:56,560
She's playing

4445
07:45:56,880 --> 07:46:01,440
Like I wonder what the dynamic is when it's just like two people because I've only ever played with like three or more

4446
07:46:02,000 --> 07:46:06,160
Like with uh, like the girls like apollo and azura and um

4447
07:46:08,800 --> 07:46:10,800
Oh the other girls

4448
07:46:10,880 --> 07:46:13,520
Let me okay. I did it. It's fine

4449
07:46:16,080 --> 07:46:18,080
And freya

4450
07:46:19,360 --> 07:46:23,760
Your fresh the special light that's what I thought I'm like, I think it's special light because my name sounds super familiar

4451
07:46:24,800 --> 07:46:27,200
All right. Well, I'll be seeing you

4452
07:46:28,960 --> 07:46:32,160
Uh, I hope you still love me after today

4453
07:46:32,640 --> 07:46:37,600
Uh, I hope you still you guys can't see what I'm doing my like putting my fingers together like

4454
07:46:38,480 --> 07:46:43,760
Like please and I'm like I'm like I'm like lin-win-well more Miranda like with my

4455
07:46:44,560 --> 07:46:47,840
With my knees turned in and my toes like pointing and stuff

4456
07:46:48,560 --> 07:46:50,560
um

4457
07:46:51,120 --> 07:46:57,440
Like I'm getting my fps fps fps wraps up because I want to play the new cod

4458
07:46:58,160 --> 07:46:59,440
uh

4459
07:46:59,440 --> 07:47:02,160
Because again, I'm I'm the best when games first come out

4460
07:47:02,240 --> 07:47:08,800
Once I like drop them for a little bit that I just don't play them and I end up turning into shit. Um, I don't know

4461
07:47:08,800 --> 07:47:10,480
I don't know why I do that

4462
07:47:10,480 --> 07:47:11,920
but uh

4463
07:47:11,920 --> 07:47:15,520
I hope you guys liked it. I hope it was entertaining

4464
07:47:16,000 --> 07:47:18,000
I don't know

4465
07:47:18,000 --> 07:47:19,440
Good time

4466
07:47:19,440 --> 07:47:26,560
And again, I like fps is like I like locking in. Um, gonna. Yeah, I'm gonna prestige 100%

4467
07:47:27,280 --> 07:47:29,760
um, I don't know how that's a comfy stream when I'm like

4468
07:47:33,440 --> 07:47:36,480
Talking about stomping on people but yeah, um

4469
07:47:38,400 --> 07:47:44,560
I'm so sleepy. It's almost 12 p.m. 12 p.m. 12 a.m. Oh my god. I don't know where I am

4470
07:47:45,360 --> 07:47:47,040
uh, I might

4471
07:47:47,040 --> 07:47:51,920
If uh, it says I did my errands today. I'll probably maybe I'll play Elden Ring tomorrow morning

4472
07:47:52,800 --> 07:47:55,360
I don't know if you guys want to watch. I'm probably just fucked around and like

4473
07:47:57,680 --> 07:47:59,680
I don't know

4474
07:48:00,080 --> 07:48:02,080
Let's do grindy shit. I don't really

4475
07:48:03,200 --> 07:48:05,200
Know if that'll be entertaining sometimes I just

4476
07:48:05,760 --> 07:48:09,600
Sometimes it's actually hard to like play a game when you have to talk over it a lot

4477
07:48:09,680 --> 07:48:11,680
Sometimes I just want to sit there and just be like

4478
07:48:13,520 --> 07:48:15,200
Say nothing

4479
07:48:15,280 --> 07:48:21,840
Like that I sometimes I was afraid because like when I do fps is I don't talk as much because I'm like, um,

4480
07:48:21,920 --> 07:48:23,760
I'm kind of more focused

4481
07:48:23,760 --> 07:48:28,160
It kind of requires a little bit more brain power for me. And so I take that and I

4482
07:48:29,280 --> 07:48:31,760
And I'm still shit. So you understand

4483
07:48:34,000 --> 07:48:40,160
Stomping doesn't really chill gaming but rena, why are you stretching out and getting all comfy on me though?

4484
07:48:40,160 --> 07:48:42,160
I'm gonna get up soon. Ha, ma'am

4485
07:48:42,480 --> 07:48:44,480
Why are you so cute?

4486
07:48:46,320 --> 07:48:51,040
You're extra cute today rena with your little with your little hammy legs. Oh, no, give me your foot back

4487
07:48:51,200 --> 07:48:53,680
I want it. Give me your foot back. Give me your foot

4488
07:48:54,720 --> 07:48:57,840
She just took it away from me. She like she just yanked it

4489
07:48:58,480 --> 07:49:03,200
I had a blash man. Um, my favorite was when the enemy fire said the first time using that gun pellet

4490
07:49:03,840 --> 07:49:05,840
Explodes

4491
07:49:06,800 --> 07:49:08,800
Thank you stash

4492
07:49:09,680 --> 07:49:11,680
But it was pretty funny

4493
07:49:13,280 --> 07:49:15,520
Yeah, it depends on the game, uh, you know

4494
07:49:17,520 --> 07:49:19,760
I do like I like I'm not good at

4495
07:49:20,480 --> 07:49:23,280
Game like I wish I was like cracked at a game

4496
07:49:23,840 --> 07:49:27,200
Like that like I think maybe like another one of my goals is to be like

4497
07:49:27,600 --> 07:49:33,760
Cracked at a game because I've never like been like really exceptional at a game

4498
07:49:34,720 --> 07:49:36,720
And it bothers me because like I'll play a game

4499
07:49:36,720 --> 07:49:38,640
I'll pour so many hours into a game

4500
07:49:38,640 --> 07:49:43,840
But then I just like won't be the level that I want to be at and I wonder what I do wrong in those cases

4501
07:49:44,800 --> 07:49:47,280
I really do because I'm like, okay. I've put in the training

4502
07:49:48,480 --> 07:49:50,480
I've put in the hours

4503
07:49:50,800 --> 07:49:52,800
I've learned the lore

4504
07:49:52,960 --> 07:49:55,440
What else is there? What do I got to do? What do I need to do?

4505
07:49:56,240 --> 07:49:58,240
Oh my god, the frames are dropping

4506
07:49:58,400 --> 07:50:00,400
exponentially

4507
07:50:00,720 --> 07:50:07,680
Um, oh cons playing street. That's cool. I've never played a fight. I'm game. Well, no, that's a lie. I've have played

4508
07:50:07,680 --> 07:50:09,680
I've never played on stream

4509
07:50:10,160 --> 07:50:15,520
Like a fighting game because I don't I'm not a huge fan of them because I mostly just spam so I don't

4510
07:50:16,160 --> 07:50:18,160
I'm not really good with the combo shit

4511
07:50:22,000 --> 07:50:26,880
Maybe one day you can do a speedrun of any game, but like what game would I even speed?

4512
07:50:27,840 --> 07:50:31,600
There's no game that I good I'm good at that I would speed run

4513
07:50:33,520 --> 07:50:35,520
Um

4514
07:50:36,480 --> 07:50:41,040
Yeah, I have to play for addition different ambition to join the and but like that's that's kind of why I played

4515
07:50:41,680 --> 07:50:45,600
Counter strike because I I played to get good. I didn't play because I liked it

4516
07:50:46,640 --> 07:50:49,760
I think that's why a lot of league players play their games. Um

4517
07:50:50,720 --> 07:50:53,520
So I think yeah, maybe that's why I was a little bit more successful

4518
07:50:54,160 --> 07:50:55,280
um

4519
07:50:55,280 --> 07:50:59,120
But yeah, have fun hanging out super mara 64. No

4520
07:51:00,080 --> 07:51:02,080
um

4521
07:51:02,480 --> 07:51:04,480
Ow I'm like

4522
07:51:05,680 --> 07:51:09,360
I don't know if I got a bug bite on my chin or something hurts arena

4523
07:51:11,520 --> 07:51:13,520
Maybe

4524
07:51:15,120 --> 07:51:18,480
Your face looks so funny me and my mom cut bit by bugs. We were in the garden

4525
07:51:19,040 --> 07:51:24,320
What's up with your face when I do this? Are you kidding? What happened to your head? Did you scratch your head rena?

4526
07:51:25,680 --> 07:51:27,680
What did you do?

4527
07:51:28,640 --> 07:51:30,640
You look like a little little lamb

4528
07:51:32,000 --> 07:51:35,680
Oh, I could eat lamb not you though rena. I wouldn't eat you. You're too precious

4529
07:51:36,400 --> 07:51:38,400
You're too precious to be eaten

4530
07:51:40,880 --> 07:51:45,360
You don't have to be good. They're animals games are done. You just have to follow. No, I want to be good

4531
07:51:45,440 --> 07:51:52,560
I want to be excellent. That's why I'm trying very hard to be excellent not excellent, but like okay at elden ring

4532
07:51:53,520 --> 07:51:57,040
I would prefer it to be an fps, but I love like elden ring is actually just like

4533
07:51:57,920 --> 07:51:59,920
A passion of mine at this point. I've been

4534
07:52:00,880 --> 07:52:05,440
You know all I do when I'm not streaming and not recording as I just watch elden ring videos

4535
07:52:06,400 --> 07:52:11,360
And walkthroughs and gameplay and speed runs and randomizers. That's all I do

4536
07:52:13,200 --> 07:52:16,560
And then I watch like game grumps and then I'll watch like mark a fire

4537
07:52:18,000 --> 07:52:20,320
Uh, and then I'll watch some vtubers naturally

4538
07:52:21,280 --> 07:52:23,920
Like my gen mates like that's all I do. That's I don't

4539
07:52:24,640 --> 07:52:26,640
That's all I do is elden ring

4540
07:52:27,120 --> 07:52:29,120
um

4541
07:52:30,160 --> 07:52:33,600
A game or yeah, I'm getting cracked in a game arc

4542
07:52:34,720 --> 07:52:40,480
You know what? So my my goal for september by the way, I want to work on uh health and fitness

4543
07:52:40,720 --> 07:52:42,720
So I don't know where to what to do with that, but um

4544
07:52:44,080 --> 07:52:46,080
I think maybe like

4545
07:52:46,320 --> 07:52:50,000
I'll have a goal to do a certain amount of squats because you know I get need to get those butt reps up

4546
07:52:50,080 --> 07:52:52,000
You know, um

4547
07:52:52,000 --> 07:52:54,000
Do like an exercise

4548
07:52:54,560 --> 07:52:58,720
You know, because I I've been so sedentary and I'm not like my body's not used to it

4549
07:52:58,720 --> 07:53:00,720
Because I used to always be on my feet for my job

4550
07:53:01,360 --> 07:53:06,800
And so I'm like, all right, let's let's pick up the slack. Let's let's do some shit. So that'll be a goal

4551
07:53:07,280 --> 07:53:09,360
And then september so it'll be

4552
07:53:10,080 --> 07:53:14,480
Get and I have a gym in my in my building. So I'll probably yeah, I said treadmill

4553
07:53:15,360 --> 07:53:20,640
Walking one of those walking treadmills would be super cool. Um, but I don't have like a stint like a

4554
07:53:22,160 --> 07:53:25,920
Like a raised desk for that that would be if I like one of those crazy desks

4555
07:53:25,920 --> 07:53:30,160
So those are like thousands of dollars. My god. Um, and I don't want one

4556
07:53:32,320 --> 07:53:34,160
And then

4557
07:53:34,160 --> 07:53:38,160
Because I have like a treadmill. Yeah in the gym and then uh

4558
07:53:39,120 --> 07:53:41,120
And then get cracked at a game

4559
07:53:41,360 --> 07:53:46,480
Do you know how how much willpower it's taking me not to only play elden ring guys?

4560
07:53:48,160 --> 07:53:52,800
And it's funny because I wasn't even going to play elden ring at all until you guys asked me to

4561
07:53:53,440 --> 07:53:55,440
Because I was gonna play everything by myself

4562
07:53:56,160 --> 07:53:58,720
And now all I want to do is stream elden ring

4563
07:53:58,720 --> 07:54:01,440
I that's why I was like, oh, I'm gonna stream elden ring this morning

4564
07:54:01,440 --> 07:54:04,640
But like I got caught up in stuff in my tummy horts like it is right now

4565
07:54:05,280 --> 07:54:10,480
And now all I want to do is just stream elder like I was like debating whether or not to ask

4566
07:54:10,880 --> 07:54:15,680
Like management if I could just make a whole channel just dedicated to elden ring

4567
07:54:19,360 --> 07:54:24,640
No, but that's shit for growth. There's a channel and I'm a mostly asmr. Well, I'm not mostly asmr

4568
07:54:25,200 --> 07:54:26,000
um

4569
07:54:26,000 --> 07:54:28,000
Goal is asmr

4570
07:54:28,000 --> 07:54:30,000
uh

4571
07:54:30,160 --> 07:54:36,000
Vindy elden ring for no, I don't I don't have the I would I would ruin my sleep schedule

4572
07:54:36,720 --> 07:54:38,720
um

4573
07:54:39,680 --> 07:54:41,680
But

4574
07:54:42,560 --> 07:54:44,560
Yeah, maybe tomorrow I'll play

4575
07:54:44,960 --> 07:54:47,440
Maybe I'll nap for like an hour and then get up

4576
07:54:48,800 --> 07:54:50,800
And then play by myself

4577
07:54:51,040 --> 07:54:56,000
I just love elden ring so much. I was listening when I was doing my errand

4578
07:54:56,240 --> 07:54:59,840
I was listening about lore about godwin the golden the night of the black knives

4579
07:54:59,920 --> 07:55:05,120
Okay, although it was from two years ago. So it's a little inaccurate, but I kind of want to finish it because that's pretty good

4580
07:55:05,440 --> 07:55:09,200
Because I was learning more about godwin because I don't know a lot about godwin because I like I made me start thinking

4581
07:55:09,200 --> 07:55:15,280
That's why I wanted to like brute force the like night that was in the place where godwin was in that one graveyard

4582
07:55:15,760 --> 07:55:19,360
Or the graveyard that one catacomb. So

4583
07:55:21,520 --> 07:55:23,520
Yeah

4584
07:55:24,880 --> 07:55:29,200
No, I played sacro I I played I have sacro

4585
07:55:30,240 --> 07:55:30,800
um

4586
07:55:30,800 --> 07:55:32,800
I played it once and

4587
07:55:33,200 --> 07:55:36,240
That was a technically the first souls game. I played

4588
07:55:36,800 --> 07:55:41,360
And I didn't understand what a souls like was I was like, oh cool

4589
07:55:41,920 --> 07:55:48,240
Like feudal era japan game get me in and then I couldn't beat the first boss

4590
07:55:49,120 --> 07:55:53,120
Like that one dude. So I never touched again. Now. I think I could probably beat him

4591
07:55:57,520 --> 07:55:59,520
Um

4592
07:55:59,920 --> 07:56:06,160
It would be maybe I'll do a week where I just do from soft game. So I'll do like blood born lies of pee. I love lies of pee

4593
07:56:06,880 --> 07:56:08,880
um

4594
07:56:08,880 --> 07:56:10,880
My little my little twink puppet

4595
07:56:11,280 --> 07:56:13,280
uh

4596
07:56:13,840 --> 07:56:20,480
Dark souls I think dark souls 3 is the best one, right? I don't know. Uh, maybe demon souls

4597
07:56:22,880 --> 07:56:26,080
Black myth wukong armored core

4598
07:56:26,240 --> 07:56:32,720
From soft. No not from soft. I said souls likes not from soft game

4599
07:56:35,200 --> 07:56:37,200
recipe is not from soft

4600
07:56:38,400 --> 07:56:40,400
No, it's not right

4601
07:56:42,560 --> 07:56:44,800
No, it's made by a korean company

4602
07:56:46,080 --> 07:56:48,080
No, we're not doing crabs treasure. I'm

4603
07:56:48,880 --> 07:56:54,080
The input lag from crabs treasure piss me off. I could not stand it

4604
07:56:56,240 --> 07:56:58,080
So

4605
07:56:58,080 --> 07:57:03,680
I was not that difficult. It was your first one. Yeah, but I didn't know the understanding the concept of one of those games

4606
07:57:08,320 --> 07:57:14,960
You get to click it to click or not. Yeah, I don't know. I was so revisit secaro 100 percent

4607
07:57:16,720 --> 07:57:23,680
Uh, sorry to hear it's fine. It's fine. All right, go on go on to mercy. It's already been an hour

4608
07:57:24,640 --> 07:57:26,640
I'll send you over

4609
07:57:26,800 --> 07:57:31,360
Yeah, I know I'd have to get a capture card for bloodborne. It's such a pain because he still won't port it over

4610
07:57:31,440 --> 07:57:36,160
Let me take off my headphones. Um, thank you guys for the dough. No doesn't get the subs today. You guys are amazing

4611
07:57:36,240 --> 07:57:38,240
I'm gonna go take a fat sleep

4612
07:57:38,800 --> 07:57:40,800
um

4613
07:57:42,720 --> 07:57:47,760
Rain is grooming herself on me. I gotta put this ball of ranch away. I just got a bottle of ranch next to my desk

4614
07:57:48,640 --> 07:57:51,440
And then fee and boomi are probably knocked out somewhere

4615
07:57:52,080 --> 07:57:56,320
Well fee is obviously the same spot. I think boomi is also sleeping on the couch near her

4616
07:57:56,880 --> 07:57:58,880
Which is very sweet and cute

4617
07:57:59,680 --> 07:58:01,680
Unless she's stealing something

4618
07:58:04,720 --> 07:58:06,720
Yeah

4619
07:58:06,720 --> 07:58:08,560
um

4620
07:58:08,560 --> 07:58:10,320
But yeah

4621
07:58:10,320 --> 07:58:15,440
Well, I don't know if that's gonna be a thing. It was just like because I like I like theme weeks. They're kind of fun

4622
07:58:15,760 --> 07:58:20,240
Um, and then it also will forces forces me to introduce new games into my

4623
07:58:21,360 --> 07:58:24,320
Like what I normally use because like maybe I'll do like a retro

4624
07:58:25,840 --> 07:58:27,360
week

4625
07:58:27,360 --> 07:58:32,080
um, so I do like maybe like Mario 64 or like old

4626
07:58:32,960 --> 07:58:34,960
Nintendo games or

4627
07:58:35,200 --> 07:58:39,600
Like do a little bit more vampire the masquerade or the old do

4628
07:58:41,280 --> 07:58:43,280
Crash Bandicoot

4629
07:58:44,080 --> 07:58:46,480
I could play one of my favorite old, um

4630
07:58:48,080 --> 07:58:50,080
Gba games

4631
07:58:50,640 --> 07:58:52,720
Which was um

4632
07:58:52,720 --> 07:58:54,720
So my dad was very cool

4633
07:58:55,440 --> 07:59:00,400
And we were when I was younger we were my parents like they had me young

4634
07:59:00,480 --> 07:59:02,080
They married or young

4635
07:59:02,080 --> 07:59:03,280
All that stuff

4636
07:59:03,280 --> 07:59:08,320
But my dad still wanted me to like have the love of video games because my dad always loved video games

4637
07:59:08,720 --> 07:59:09,760
so he

4638
07:59:09,840 --> 07:59:13,600
Built an emulator into my into the family computer

4639
07:59:13,680 --> 07:59:18,960
And so I was able to he was able to emulate like all gba games and game boy games

4640
07:59:19,440 --> 07:59:24,080
In some ds games. And so I remember playing uh crazy racers

4641
07:59:26,720 --> 07:59:29,120
Which was like really bad knockoff Mario Kart

4642
07:59:30,720 --> 07:59:32,400
Um

4643
07:59:32,400 --> 07:59:35,600
Yeah, it was pretty as that was I remember I loved playing that game

4644
07:59:35,600 --> 07:59:40,480
And I would it's it was so goofy

4645
07:59:41,600 --> 07:59:44,240
And I haven't revisited that game in such a long time

4646
07:59:45,920 --> 07:59:47,920
I also remember playing like

4647
07:59:47,920 --> 07:59:52,960
Like Prince of Persia on that like my dad pulled like so many games that were like so past my time

4648
07:59:53,760 --> 07:59:57,760
So that's why I'm a little bit more cultured when it comes to games. Although not really

4649
07:59:58,400 --> 08:00:01,840
Because like I would try like a game once and I'd be like, oh never mind. Um

4650
08:00:02,800 --> 08:00:06,240
God, that's so my beloved. Yeah, but my dad. Yeah, my dad

4651
08:00:07,040 --> 08:00:08,560
um

4652
08:00:08,560 --> 08:00:11,520
My parents tried a lot. I also was a kid who didn't want a lot

4653
08:00:12,000 --> 08:00:13,520
My mom would be like

4654
08:00:13,520 --> 08:00:15,760
You want a toy from a toy store and I'm like

4655
08:00:16,880 --> 08:00:18,640
I would like

4656
08:00:18,640 --> 08:00:25,440
One stuffed animal and they're like we literally offered you anything you want and I'm like once I would like this

4657
08:00:26,080 --> 08:00:28,080
stuffed animal, please

4658
08:00:28,320 --> 08:00:30,800
My parents are like what the hell's wrong with our child? Um

4659
08:00:32,400 --> 08:00:34,000
But yeah

4660
08:00:34,000 --> 08:00:36,000
Love god of war. Uh, you know

4661
08:00:38,080 --> 08:00:44,320
I have god of war ragnarok on my playstation. I had never played a god of war game

4662
08:00:46,400 --> 08:00:48,400
Uh

4663
08:00:48,720 --> 08:00:53,280
I played a little bit of ragnarok, but I just got bored with it

4664
08:00:54,160 --> 08:00:56,160
I don't know why

4665
08:00:56,480 --> 08:01:02,800
Like sometimes if I get distracted by other things I and it's not super capturing my interest in the beginning

4666
08:01:03,120 --> 08:01:05,120
Then I don't play it like I played

4667
08:01:05,440 --> 08:01:10,800
Uh, there's there's a couple of games like that on my playstation that I just didn't finish

4668
08:01:11,840 --> 08:01:13,840
That's because it's on me

4669
08:01:13,840 --> 08:01:15,840
gta 5 store, uh

4670
08:01:17,600 --> 08:01:24,800
I remember playing why I didn't play I remember watching kids play like gta when I like was at school

4671
08:01:25,760 --> 08:01:29,520
But I never I have a number gta or which gta it was

4672
08:01:30,160 --> 08:01:32,160
um

4673
08:01:33,680 --> 08:01:35,920
Uh, I've actually never played gta

4674
08:01:36,800 --> 08:01:38,480
Like I have the game

4675
08:01:38,480 --> 08:01:40,560
There's a lot of games I have but I've never played

4676
08:01:41,200 --> 08:01:42,880
um

4677
08:01:42,880 --> 08:01:48,240
I usually buy them when they're on sale like I know drop ragnarok for elden ring. No, I like

4678
08:01:49,920 --> 08:01:51,920
Did I drop ragnarok for elden ring?

4679
08:01:52,960 --> 08:01:54,720
Maybe I did

4680
08:01:55,680 --> 08:01:57,680
Yeah, I did actually technically

4681
08:01:59,120 --> 08:02:04,160
Yeah, because I got like because I bought the ragnarok bundle for the playstation 5

4682
08:02:05,360 --> 08:02:07,520
And then elden ring came out

4683
08:02:08,320 --> 08:02:14,240
And I was playing ragnarok and then I play yeah, so I I I guess I did drop ragnarok for elden ring

4684
08:02:16,400 --> 08:02:18,880
I knew it and then I literally was

4685
08:02:21,200 --> 08:02:23,200
I was so

4686
08:02:24,080 --> 08:02:26,080
Hooked like I had like

4687
08:02:26,800 --> 08:02:27,920
the

4688
08:02:27,920 --> 08:02:33,360
I haven't had a hyper fixation like that and like I still like it came back which is rare

4689
08:02:33,440 --> 08:02:38,080
Like I usually don't come back to hyper fixations like they just they're tucked away

4690
08:02:38,720 --> 08:02:40,720
nicely

4691
08:02:40,720 --> 08:02:45,680
Uh in the corner of my heart in my mind because like I really like um

4692
08:02:46,880 --> 08:02:50,560
I had a hyper fixation on snakes and spiders for a long time

4693
08:02:50,800 --> 08:02:53,600
But like I'll go and like I'll watch like maybe like a snake

4694
08:02:54,400 --> 08:02:56,160
patching review

4695
08:02:56,160 --> 08:03:00,240
Just because because I like to see like what like the genetic odds are of stuff

4696
08:03:00,720 --> 08:03:02,800
but then like but for elden ring like it just

4697
08:03:04,160 --> 08:03:10,400
Constantly like the lord it's really all comes down to the world building the character development

4698
08:03:10,960 --> 08:03:17,120
And the lore that's I think that's why and then like with god or ragnarok. Yeah, it's based on

4699
08:03:17,920 --> 08:03:21,280
Like mythology and stuff, but I don't know maybe because it's its own worlds

4700
08:03:22,800 --> 08:03:26,880
Elden ring, I don't know why elden ring sets itself apart for other things for me

4701
08:03:27,520 --> 08:03:29,920
I was like probably one of my favorite games of all time

4702
08:03:30,800 --> 08:03:32,400
um

4703
08:03:32,400 --> 08:03:36,480
I wasn't exit. No. Yeah, I just I I couldn't tell you why

4704
08:03:37,600 --> 08:03:39,600
um

4705
08:03:40,160 --> 08:03:46,320
Like because I literally I used to play like ttt on gary's mod

4706
08:03:47,120 --> 08:03:51,680
Hold on. I'm gonna go on my steam right now and I'll look at my library

4707
08:04:01,040 --> 08:04:06,080
I'll play brawl hollow I would play counter strike

4708
08:04:08,160 --> 08:04:10,160
See his go

4709
08:04:11,360 --> 08:04:14,880
I would play destiny, but I mostly plays at him play station

4710
08:04:15,760 --> 08:04:17,760
I played skyrim

4711
08:04:23,760 --> 08:04:26,800
I would play like pub g and stuff too. I liked pub g

4712
08:04:29,680 --> 08:04:34,480
I used to play fortnite for like a little bit a lot of stuff was like if a friend was like friends

4713
08:04:35,040 --> 08:04:36,960
We're like, hey, you want to play it? I'm like, yeah

4714
08:04:36,960 --> 08:04:39,760
And then I would like just be carried the entire time because I'm shit

4715
08:04:39,760 --> 08:04:43,760
And I just perpetuate that woman or shit a video game stereotype inscription was good

4716
08:04:43,840 --> 08:04:47,200
I think maybe I liked inscription because the lore base and this the especially unique

4717
08:04:47,760 --> 08:04:49,760
I never played a deck builder before

4718
08:04:50,720 --> 08:04:55,120
Um, I have outlast. What did I get at? When did I get outlast?

4719
08:04:57,040 --> 08:04:59,920
I do not recall. I never played it though

4720
08:05:06,000 --> 08:05:08,000
I remember playing project winter for a little bit

4721
08:05:14,480 --> 08:05:16,080
Yeah

4722
08:05:16,080 --> 08:05:19,600
I'm freaking wolf quest. I was always on wolf quest

4723
08:05:20,400 --> 08:05:22,400
but I have

4724
08:05:22,400 --> 08:05:24,960
I just fucking love elden ring so much

4725
08:05:26,560 --> 08:05:29,440
I think I like elden ring maybe because it reminds me a lot of skyrim

4726
08:05:30,400 --> 08:05:32,400
Although it's not the same, but you know what I mean

4727
08:05:34,160 --> 08:05:37,120
I know I I saw a ball uh ballotro

4728
08:05:37,760 --> 08:05:42,320
Ball I want to call it ball taro because the preacher that's how strong he pronounces it, but that's not correct

4729
08:05:42,720 --> 08:05:45,360
I want to play block bail lotro ballotro

4730
08:05:46,480 --> 08:05:48,480
um

4731
08:05:48,720 --> 08:05:50,720
Because strong you like

4732
08:05:50,720 --> 08:05:53,760
hyperfixated on it for a little bit and I was like, hmm interesting

4733
08:05:54,000 --> 08:05:54,720
And I like for a little bit

4734
08:05:54,720 --> 08:06:00,640
I was actually into hearthstone, which is really weird for me because I usually am not into like that sort of stuff

4735
08:06:01,280 --> 08:06:07,120
Um, again, I love like lore character role building all that shit. I've never played dnd in my life

4736
08:06:07,920 --> 08:06:09,280
um

4737
08:06:09,280 --> 08:06:13,520
Never did a dnd d dnd dnd campaign

4738
08:06:14,000 --> 08:06:18,320
I have balder's gate on my playstation. I only played for three hours

4739
08:06:19,040 --> 08:06:25,840
And I'm like, when do I get to fuck the vampire dude? Like that's all I'm playing for I bought this for this reason

4740
08:06:27,760 --> 08:06:29,760
I saw

4741
08:06:29,760 --> 08:06:31,760
The one trailer of that guy

4742
08:06:32,000 --> 08:06:36,320
Uh sleeping with the druid that like went viral and I was like, I want this game

4743
08:06:36,320 --> 08:06:42,560
I think this would be funny that you can do that. I want to play it

4744
08:06:45,760 --> 08:06:49,440
And then I played it. I'm like, what am I do? I have no idea what I'm doing

4745
08:06:49,520 --> 08:06:53,520
There's so much stuff that I don't know and I blame my dad

4746
08:06:54,160 --> 08:06:56,160
Clean up my dad likes that stuff

4747
08:06:56,320 --> 08:06:58,320
Oh

4748
08:07:01,440 --> 08:07:06,640
Skyrim the latest god of war. Yeah, they're nordic mythology and I love norse mythology. Norse mythology is super cool

4749
08:07:06,640 --> 08:07:10,560
That's why I like like vikings and like the last kingdom and stuff. It's really like I love

4750
08:07:11,360 --> 08:07:12,800
um

4751
08:07:12,800 --> 08:07:16,800
I also like this like historical fiction or like period pieces are super cool to me

4752
08:07:17,840 --> 08:07:20,960
Uh, I think that's why I like lies of pee because it was like

4753
08:07:21,600 --> 08:07:27,360
Victorian london or like england or whatever. Although it's really not. It's just like fake same with like bloodborne

4754
08:07:27,360 --> 08:07:30,160
I've never played bloodborne, but it's so aesthetically pleasing for me

4755
08:07:30,160 --> 08:07:35,600
I'd probably become just obsessed with bloodborne has uh, I do my obsession with elden ring

4756
08:07:38,080 --> 08:07:42,800
Be alert d&d can't be like who would be the master though like who would do that?

4757
08:07:43,680 --> 08:07:45,680
Like I'm pretty good at improv

4758
08:07:45,680 --> 08:07:47,680
um

4759
08:07:48,640 --> 08:07:51,440
I don't know about the other girls. Mercy's pretty decent at improv

4760
08:07:51,920 --> 08:07:55,680
I don't think I would want it like I would want to be the dungeon master

4761
08:07:55,680 --> 08:07:59,440
But because I've never done it before I don't think I should be the dungeon master

4762
08:08:02,480 --> 08:08:03,760
Um

4763
08:08:03,760 --> 08:08:06,160
But I watched that one clip of that like famous

4764
08:08:07,200 --> 08:08:09,920
Well, she's not famous like she's like normal celebrity

4765
08:08:10,320 --> 08:08:14,560
Um, she used to be on true blood one of my favorite guilty pleasure shows about vampires

4766
08:08:14,880 --> 08:08:17,680
Or she plays a vamp like the our ride headed vampire girl

4767
08:08:17,760 --> 08:08:23,280
And there's a clip of her explaining how she likes to like how she's a dungeon master for d&d

4768
08:08:24,080 --> 08:08:28,080
And how like her games of d&d flow and she like literally brings in

4769
08:08:28,800 --> 08:08:30,240
um

4770
08:08:30,240 --> 08:08:33,680
Like she was really talking to the guy who plays the punisher because she you know, she plays

4771
08:08:34,240 --> 08:08:36,240
What's her face and dare devil

4772
08:08:36,240 --> 08:08:37,360
and

4773
08:08:37,360 --> 08:08:42,640
Something burnt all I can't remember his name too. His last name is burnt all so she's telling burnt all like oh

4774
08:08:42,640 --> 08:08:47,840
This is what I do like you hear this and I love that clip and I'm like I want to do d&d

4775
08:08:48,640 --> 08:08:52,880
But it's like the character sheets and stuff like always overwhelm me because I'm not good at math

4776
08:08:55,600 --> 08:08:57,600
I never played metal gear solid

4777
08:08:58,000 --> 08:09:05,040
Guys, there's a lot of games. I haven't played that I own like I oh like I you can't see I'm doing parentheses like I own

4778
08:09:05,600 --> 08:09:07,600
I like your solid thanks to my dad

4779
08:09:08,560 --> 08:09:12,320
And my dad has like crisis and stuff and like a bunch of other games

4780
08:09:13,200 --> 08:09:15,680
I like playstation in the basement

4781
08:09:19,040 --> 08:09:21,520
Plans of supplies to have fun, isn't it? Yeah, I bet

4782
08:09:26,400 --> 08:09:32,240
You know, I wouldn't be surprised if like there's been a lot of like unity related stuff lately in the vtuber community

4783
08:09:32,240 --> 08:09:34,240
Because you have like the gta rp server

4784
08:09:34,960 --> 08:09:36,960
Uh, you've had the mario kart

4785
08:09:37,520 --> 08:09:42,400
And the minecraft stuff. I wouldn't be surprised if somebody tried to do like a group d&d thing

4786
08:09:43,040 --> 08:09:48,880
I generally wouldn't be surprised again. I don't know if we'd be invited, but you know, it is what it is with

4787
08:09:50,720 --> 08:09:56,800
One day we'll be invited to stuff. Um, and I I'll be patient even if we never do like we'll make our own

4788
08:09:57,440 --> 08:09:59,440
Our own fun memories and stuff

4789
08:10:00,160 --> 08:10:03,600
Uh battlefield one. Yeah, I liked um

4790
08:10:04,560 --> 08:10:06,560
Uh

4791
08:10:08,080 --> 08:10:12,080
What was the I can't remember what the most recent

4792
08:10:13,600 --> 08:10:15,600
Oh, never mind. I can't think of it

4793
08:10:16,800 --> 08:10:20,160
Um, I'm yeah, I'm losing what I'm talking about because I'm tired

4794
08:10:21,040 --> 08:10:24,400
So I'm gonna go to bed tell mercy. I say hello. Um

4795
08:10:24,800 --> 08:10:26,800
Um

4796

4797
08:10:36,320 --> 08:10:41,360
