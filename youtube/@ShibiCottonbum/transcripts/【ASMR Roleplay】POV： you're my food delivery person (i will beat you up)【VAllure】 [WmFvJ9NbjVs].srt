1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm going to go ahead and put it back in the oven and I'm going to put it back in the oven and I'm going to put it back in the oven and I'm going to put it back in the oven and I'm going to put it back in the oven and I'm going to put it back in the oven and I'm going to put it back in the oven and I'm going to put it back in the oven and I'm going to put it back in the oven and I'm going to put it back in the oven and I'm going to put it back in the oven and I'm going to put it back in the oven and I'm going to put it back in the oven and I'm going to put it back in the oven and I'm going to put it back in the oven and I'm going to put it back in the oven and I'm going to put it back in the oven and I'm going to put it back in the oven and I'm going to put it back in the oven and I'm going to put it back in the oven and

2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,140
I'm going to put it back in the oven and I'm going to add the

3
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:26,360
Jamie's

4
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:12,360
Oh, you're finally here.

5
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,360
What took you so long?

6
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:26,360
I ordered my food an hour ago

7
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:34,360
and you only just got here.

8
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:41,360
I think that's poor service.

9
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:48,360
I think you owe me now.

10
00:03:48,360 --> 00:04:08,360
I get a lot of evidence right inside.

11
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,360
I'm scared.

12
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:32,360
I'm scared about it.

13
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,360
Hi.

14
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:45,360
Nice to meet you.

15
00:04:45,360 --> 00:05:02,360
Sorry, am I too close?

16
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,360
You've still got lost.

17
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:14,360
I don't think my house is that hard to find, really.

18
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:27,360
I think it's quite easy to find where I am.

19
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:36,360
I apologize if you hear scratching in the background.

20
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:41,360
That's the last person who I ordered from.

21
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,360
They're scrabbling around the house right now.

22
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,360
I don't have any cats.

23
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:15,360
It's just rats.

24
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,360
Does the rain sound okay?

25
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:31,360
I hope it does.

26
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,360
The rain is rather loud.

27
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:41,360
Oh, you're soaked.

28
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,360
That's a pity.

29
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:53,360
You know, I have some towels if you need to dry off.

30
00:06:53,360 --> 00:07:00,360
It's no issue, really.

31
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:07,360
Oh, I can always heat up the food.

32
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,360
It's no problem.

33
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:18,360
Not a problem at all.

34
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:27,360
Where do you think you're going?

35
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,360
You can't leave?

36
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:40,360
Why are you trying the door?

37
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:47,360
You really should just hang out.

38
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:54,360
It's locked.

39
00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:05,360
I think, you know, the best way to repay me is, you know,

40
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:16,360
accept my hospitality for a while and come in and dry off.

41
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,360
You have other orders?

42
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,360
Oh, that's fine.

43
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:29,360
Your other deliveries can wait like I did.

44
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,360
There's no use trying to leave.

45
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:43,360
Here, take a seat.

46
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,360
Sit with me on the couch.

47
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,360
Put your button.

48
00:08:50,360 --> 00:09:04,360
Grab you a towel.

49
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:08,360
Here you go.

50
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:13,360
I know it looks similar to a blanket, but I swear it's a very nice towel.

51
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,360
So why don't you just put that?

52
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:26,360
Yeah, just wipe yourself off, okay?

53
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:49,360
You think the towel smells nice?

54
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:55,360
That's good. I just used it.

55
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,360
Shocked I live alone out here.

56
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:03,360
Oh, it's no issue.

57
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,360
No issue at all.

58
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:13,360
I quite like the solitude.

59
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:50,360
Yes, sometimes I get sad I don't have anyone to share it with.

60
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:56,360
You can't leave my hat.

61
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:02,360
I have to make sure I like the food or I give you your review.

62
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:17,360
Maybe you can redeem yourself by behaving and I won't give you one star.

63
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,360
Stop arguing with me.

64
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:26,360
Sorry, I didn't mean to use that tone of voice.

65
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:41,360
You can continue trying.

66
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:47,360
Do you need help?

67
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,360
I can help you.

68
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:59,360
I don't think I need help here.

69
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:05,360
It's so wet and soaking.

70
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:12,360
We must have been standing outside in the rain for quite some time.

71
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,360
Doing so many different deliveries.

72
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,360
Besides mine.

73
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:27,360
Okay, here I go.

74
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,360
I try not to hold grudges.

75
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:38,360
There's some holding grudges.

76
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,360
I hope I am quite a nice lady.

77
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:12,360
There's no need for you to worry.

78
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,360
No need at all.

79
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:25,360
What's that?

80
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,360
Let me take care of you.

81
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:39,360
What can I do?

82
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,360
You took so long on my damn order.

83
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,360
I got the fight.

84
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,360
I want all the grudge.

85
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:58,360
Put on me if you stay put and believe.

86
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:04,360
I get so lonely here sometimes.

87
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:29,360
So lonely.

88
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,360
There you go.

89
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,360
We aren't right off now.

90
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,360
Do you feel a little bit better?

91
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,360
You can come sit with me on the couch.

92
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:49,360
Why don't you like that?

93
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,360
I think you would.

94
00:14:51,360 --> 00:15:00,360
Why don't you?

95
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:09,360
Of course.

96
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:17,360
You can sit right next to me if you want.

97
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,360
You won't get the couch wet.

98
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,360
You do that all the time.

99
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,360
It's no problem.

100
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:34,360
So I see that my food is still in your hand.

101
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:40,360
Do you mind if I...

102
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:51,360
Can you pass it to me please?

103
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,360
Thank you.

104
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,360
You didn't take any bites, did you?

105
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:05,360
I've had people do that before.

106
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:17,360
I'm just going to inspect everything if you don't mind.

107
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:31,360
I know there's ways to replace the sticker.

108
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,360
Uh-uh.

109
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,360
Where do you think you're going?

110
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:43,360
Come back here.

111
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,360
Come on.

112
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,360
Come back down.

113
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,360
I'm not done looking through the food yet.

114
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,360
Good boy.

115
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,360
So obedient.

116
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:06,360
Add a little feisty.

117
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,360
I think everything is in order.

118
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:15,360
Have some silverware.

119
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:26,360
I have a food here.

120
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:50,360
It seems like something is missing.

121
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:58,360
It seems like something is missing.

122
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:09,360
I specifically ordered a drink.

123
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,360
I don't see it here.

124
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:21,360
I ordered a diet doctor kelp.

125
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:27,360
I definitely ordered a drink.

126
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,360
Where is it?

127
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,360
Did you take it?

128
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,360
No.

129
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,360
It says it there in my order.

130
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:48,360
I'll show you on my phone.

131
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,360
Just scroll down.

132
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,360
It's right there.

133
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,360
What do you have to say for yourself?

134
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:08,360
Did you drink my diet doctor kelp?

135
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,360
Be honest.

136
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,360
I promise I won't get too mad.

137
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:20,360
Or hurt you.

138
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:27,360
I don't know why I keep saying such silly things.

139
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,360
Oh, wait.

140
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,360
Hi.

141
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:38,360
I found it here.

142
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,360
It was on the floor.

143
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,360
Were you trying to hide it?

144
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,360
I'll keep it for yourself.

145
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:54,360
It seemed to have rolled under my couch.

146
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:59,360
Pretty odd, I do say.

147
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:27,360
Moa, you couldn't just be honest with me?

148
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:50,360
Let's get it open.

149
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,360
I hope it's not shaken up.

150
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,360
Do you mind?

151
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:03,360
It doesn't seem to be working.

152
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,360
Thank you.

153
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:16,360
I appreciate it.

154
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,360
Oh, very sweet.

155
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,360
It's with the soda.

156
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:30,360
Open, Moa.

157
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:42,360
Don't mind if I do.

158
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:51,360
No, I don't need any ice.

159
00:21:51,360 --> 00:22:10,360
I love how it sizzles on my tongue.

160
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:22,360
Did you want a sip?

161
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,360
I don't mind.

162
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:34,360
You seem like a good boy that doesn't have any serious diseases or anything.

163
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:39,360
But you do seem like a dirty boy.

164
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,360
Sorry.

165
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,360
Here, you can have a sip.

166
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:58,360
I don't mind one bit.

167
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,360
Sometimes that happens.

168
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,360
Here.

169
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:08,360
Why don't you have a sip?

170
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:14,360
I'm sorry.

171
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,360
I didn't mean to burp in your face.

172
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:44,360
Here, pass it back to me.

173
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:19,360
Are you good, huh?

174
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:24,360
Usually I don't make these sugary drinks.

175
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:41,360
What's that on your dot mind?

176
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:48,360
Would you like to share my food?

177
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,360
I need to try it.

178
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:58,360
I would like if you stuck around.

179
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:09,360
I hope I'm getting too close to some bothering.

180
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:34,360
Here, there's even an extra fork.

181
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:38,360
You work so hard.

182
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:45,360
It's only fair that I share my meal with you.

183
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:51,360
Even though you don't deserve it and you took forever.

184
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,360
I don't know.

185
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:36,360
He's such fancy things to transport for holidays.

186
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:57,360
Uh-oh.

187
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,360
It seems that I dropped a book.

188
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:12,360
You might go down to get it.

189
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:20,360
Please.

190
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:28,360
You're burping, huh?

191
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:36,360
I think it's right there.

192
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:43,360
Thank you.

193
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:53,360
I appreciate it.

194
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,360
You can just share a fork instead.

195
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:10,360
I promise I don't have any goodies.

196
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:28,360
It tastes pretty good.

197
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:32,360
You're a good kid.

198
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:52,360
That's so sweet.

199
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:57,360
Five of all of us.

200
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,360
Do you want me to feed you?

201
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:04,360
Like a good boy?

202
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,360
No, I bet you could do it yourself.

203
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,360
Right?

204
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,360
I don't mind though.

205
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:20,360
If you want me to, you just have to open your mouth.

206
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:24,360
I'll give you what you want.

207
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:33,360
A delicious bite.

208
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:40,360
Say hi.

209
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:50,360
Say hi.

210
00:29:50,360 --> 00:30:19,360
Uh-huh.

211
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:25,360
Now a part of me is inside you.

212
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:30,360
You're so easily fooled.

213
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:36,360
Here, you can actually have a bite.

214
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:41,360
Yeah, open wide just like that.

215
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:54,360
Good little delivery driver you are.

216
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:58,360
Okay, chew.

217
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:02,360
Go on.

218
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:09,360
Now swallow.

219
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,360
Good job.

220
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:16,360
You're so good at following directions.

221
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:24,360
I like it when you gulp it down like that.

222
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,360
Good night.

223
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:30,360
I keep eating right now.

224
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:44,360
I actually think I quite like where I am sitting in front of you.

225
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:55,360
So I think I'll stay here and continue eating.

226
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:10,360
This is very, very good.

227
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:23,360
I have to then see the chew too loudly sometimes.

228
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:28,360
I hope you don't mind how loud I can chew.

229
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:37,360
There's a drink.

230
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:52,360
I like how it feels as it runs down the back of my throat gulping down.

231
00:32:52,360 --> 00:33:02,360
That's some good diet doctor help will tell you that much.

232
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:10,360
Do you want any more food?

233
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,360
No.

234
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:20,360
You look delicious enough to eat yourself.

235
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:31,360
I wonder what if I just...

236
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:58,360
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

237
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:01,360
This side would be tastier.

238
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,360
Perhaps maybe.

239
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:19,360
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

240
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,360
Uh oh.

241
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,360
I think I have to poop again.

242
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:49,360
I can eat some dvds.

243
00:34:49,360 --> 00:35:05,360
I wonder what your mouth tastes like.

244
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:18,360
Not as good as your ears are, but it's fine.

245
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:22,360
You know, you're kind of cute.

246
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:27,360
You could stay over if you wanted.

247
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,360
I'm up to you.

248
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:37,360
Well, you probably have other deliveries or whatever.

249
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:49,360
It doesn't matter to me.

250
00:35:49,360 --> 00:36:05,360
If not, I would still like to try some things with you as a recompense for you bringing my food light.

251
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:11,360
Hmm.

252
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:14,360
Oh, it's not too much of a problem.

253
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:17,360
I won't upset your schedule.

254
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:21,360
Are you sure?

255
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:24,360
Are you positive?

256
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:31,360
I would hate to be a burden for you.

257
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:39,360
I hope you don't pick up me as too much trouble.

258
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:43,360
Oh, thank you so much.

259
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:48,360
You're so sweet, thank kind to me.

260
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:51,360
Just a little customer.

261
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:54,360
I don't think I deserve you.

262
00:36:54,360 --> 00:37:00,360
Such a good boy.

263
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:11,360
So, why don't you come home and couch with me?

264
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:19,360
And I'll take care of you, and then I'll send you on your merry way.

265
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:27,360
Yes, come on.

266
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:35,360
I think this will be easier if I sat in your lap.

267
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:45,360
I want you to try this massaging technique.

268
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:50,360
I hope you don't mind if I try it on you.

269
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:55,360
And that's it. I swear I won't let you go.

270
00:37:55,360 --> 00:38:01,360
Whoops, you have other requests of me that you would want me to do to you.

271
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,360
Hmm.

272
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,360
Okay.

273
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,360
Thank you.

274
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,360
Thank you.

275
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:43,360
Does that feel all right?

276
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,360
Boy.

277
00:38:45,360 --> 00:39:10,360
What a good delivery boy you are.

278
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:17,360
How are you working this kind of job anyway?

279
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:22,360
You seem like you should be doing something more.

280
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:37,360
Excited.

281
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:43,360
You need the money?

282
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:56,360
You know, if you were mine, I would take really good care of you.

283
00:39:56,360 --> 00:40:03,360
You wouldn't have to worry about money ever again.

284
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:52,360
Perfect, you'll be my little pet.

285
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,360
Perfect.

286
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:51,360
You're so soft and attached.

287
00:41:52,360 --> 00:42:20,360
Your skin is like silk.

288
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:31,360
You're so fine. You have a lot of jokes, don't you?

289
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:36,360
I like a pet that can make me laugh.

290
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:41,360
The last one doesn't make me laugh.

291
00:42:41,360 --> 00:43:06,360
They make me angry.

292
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:11,360
Are you gonna make me angry?

293
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:35,360
Why would you please me like a good boy?

294
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:40,360
Good.

295
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:47,360
Very good.

296
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:50,360
All right.

297
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:54,360
Well, you did a favor for me.

298
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:58,360
You spent time with me while I was alone.

299
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:04,360
So, what can I do to make you happy?

300
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:10,360
I think you like the massage and the tapping.

301
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:23,360
So, I'll take some special requests from you.

302
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:27,360
What can I do to help?

303
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:32,360
Use any inks and paint.

304
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:46,360
You know, I have a very special method to make a lot of paint go away.

305
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:52,360
Do you wanna know what it is?

306
00:44:52,360 --> 00:45:01,360
It's very simple.

307
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:22,360
So, let me just get behind you.

308
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:39,360
And I have this thing where I say a few words while counting backwards from them.

309
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:44,360
So, the paint will go away.

310
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:52,360
Do you think you can handle that?

311
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:57,360
Do you promise?

312
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:06,360
Okay, let's try it.

313
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:35,360
Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.

314
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:51,360
Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.

315
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,360
Zapp!

316
00:46:53,360 --> 00:47:19,360
Zapp!

317
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,360
Zapp!

318
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:49,360
Zapp!

319
00:47:49,360 --> 00:48:10,360
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1

320
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:15,360
9, 7, 8, 9, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 35, 36, 38, 40, 39, 41, 41

321
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:30,180
no no no no no no no no no setting

322
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:56,180
I thought I was going to count to zero, but do you feel more relaxed now?

323
00:48:56,180 --> 00:49:18,180
I want to scratch your brain.

324
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:46,180
Scroll inside it.

325
00:49:47,180 --> 00:50:01,180
Stretch a little.

326
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:14,180
You can even pull my nose.

327
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:26,180
Sorry, don't mind that.

328
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:32,180
Okay, is there anything you want me to do?

329
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:57,180
I think you're more quiet.

330
00:50:57,180 --> 00:51:02,180
Just a little bit.

331
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:26,180
One second.

332
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:46,180
Just a little bit.

333
00:51:46,180 --> 00:52:11,180
Just a little bit.

334
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:17,180
I think these pop rocks are nice.

335
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:20,180
These ones are good.

336
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:40,180
You should not have peckled.

337
00:52:40,180 --> 00:53:09,180
Just a little bit.

338
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:34,180
Just a little bit.

339
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:50,180
Just a little bit.

340
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:26,180
Just a little bit.

341
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:55,180
Just a little bit.

342
00:54:55,180 --> 00:55:24,180
Just a little bit.

343
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:47,180
Just a little bit.

344
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:50,180
Let's see.

345
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:57,180
What other triggers would you guys like?

346
00:55:57,180 --> 00:56:00,180
Snapping.

347
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:08,180
I can do snapping and sniffing and affirmations.

348
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:13,180
Sorry, that's a kid outside.

349
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:30,180
I thought that was a cat.

350
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:33,180
Yeah, it wasn't a cat. That was a child.

351
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:35,180
Outside my window.

352
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:44,180
Which is crazy because I'm on my fourth one.

353
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:46,180
What's up my line of work?

354
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:54,180
Oh, I'm what they call a woman of the night.

355
00:56:54,180 --> 00:57:16,180
Oh, what do you want?

356
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:38,180
What do you want?

357
00:57:38,180 --> 00:58:04,180
Sorry, there's a camera on my keyboard.

358
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:16,180
Does he know?

359
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:29,180
I don't think he knows.

360
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:53,180
Make sure to check all my links in the description below.

361
00:58:53,180 --> 00:59:15,180
I think it's time I give you a sniff.

362
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:44,180
Let's see if you smell good enough to eat again.

363
00:59:44,180 --> 01:00:13,180
Let's see if you smell good enough to eat again.

364
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:21,180
Smell stinky.

365
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:29,180
A rabbit is sniffing you and she says you smell stinky.

366
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:40,180
Smell stinky.

367
01:00:40,180 --> 01:01:02,180
Smell stinky.

368
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:22,180
Smell stinky.

369
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:48,180
That's a good stink.

370
01:01:48,180 --> 01:02:15,180
Smell stinky.

371
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:37,180
Smell stinky.

372
01:02:37,180 --> 01:02:59,180
Smell stinky.

373
01:02:59,180 --> 01:03:16,180
Hold on, neighbor is walking by.

374
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:25,180
Okay, I think they're gone. Quite noisy.

375
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:54,180
You guys have positive affirmations.

376
01:03:54,180 --> 01:04:09,180
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, it's delicious.

377
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:16,180
I'm gonna blow my nose again.

378
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:31,180
I can't get this to you.

379
01:04:31,180 --> 01:04:41,180
It's a bee.

380
01:04:41,180 --> 01:04:53,180
Hi.

381
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:57,180
I hope you had a good day today.

382
01:04:57,180 --> 01:05:04,180
You're so sweet. You deserve the bestest updates.

383
01:05:04,180 --> 01:05:10,180
I wish I could give you anything you ever wanted.

384
01:05:10,180 --> 01:05:20,180
You work so hard. I just want to give back to you.

385
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:29,180
You do such a good job for yourself. I know it might be hard every day.

386
01:05:29,180 --> 01:05:39,180
But you want to make sure you count the little victories. That's what I always say.

387
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:49,180
Even if your little victory today was just getting out of bed this morning, I want you to be proud of yourself.

388
01:05:49,180 --> 01:05:54,180
If you brushed your teeth, I want you to be proud.

389
01:05:54,180 --> 01:06:00,180
If you took a shower, if you changed your clothes, you made your bed.

390
01:06:00,180 --> 01:06:08,180
If you made an effort today, if you just tried your best.

391
01:06:08,180 --> 01:06:14,180
That's all that matters.

392
01:06:14,180 --> 01:06:23,180
I'm really proud of you. You may think that you're not good enough, but you are.

393
01:06:23,180 --> 01:06:30,180
You're too good. Such a good boy.

394
01:06:30,180 --> 01:06:35,180
Such a good boy.

395
01:06:35,180 --> 01:06:44,180
Especially for mommy.

396
01:06:44,180 --> 01:06:54,180
You do such great things. You need to give yourself a little bit more credit.

397
01:06:54,180 --> 01:07:00,180
Sorry, that's my chair.

398
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:10,180
I want to give you a hug sometimes when you're sad, because I know you've had a rough day in the past.

399
01:07:10,180 --> 01:07:16,180
Just know everything's gonna be okay.

400
01:07:16,180 --> 01:07:25,180
I'll be here by your side, even when you have nobody else. Don't forget that.

401
01:07:25,180 --> 01:07:32,180
I'm giving you the biggest hugs.

402
01:07:32,180 --> 01:07:43,180
You're the softest, sweetest kisses.

403
01:07:43,180 --> 01:07:46,180
I love you very much.

404
01:07:46,180 --> 01:07:58,180
I'm so grateful and thankful for you every day, but you can't rely on me for your happiness.

405
01:07:58,180 --> 01:08:06,180
You've got to look in words at yourself and remind yourself how great of a person you are,

406
01:08:06,180 --> 01:08:14,180
because you're a good person. You try your hardest.

407
01:08:14,180 --> 01:08:29,180
And you deserve everything for that.

408
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:38,180
I want you to try to be the best person you can be. Yes, a better person.

409
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:46,180
But you'll be difficult, because you're already perfect, but it doesn't hurt to try.

410
01:08:46,180 --> 01:08:50,180
I want you to treat yourself with kindness.

411
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:55,180
I want you to treat everybody else around you with kindness.

412
01:08:55,180 --> 01:09:02,180
Oh.

413
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:10,180
That was crazy.

414
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:13,180
Come on, that's a 10.

415
01:09:13,180 --> 01:09:24,180
I think you guys like, so I do really loud burps. I think you guys just like longer burps.

416
01:09:24,180 --> 01:09:29,180
I wish I could grow up with you and lay on your chest.

417
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:33,180
Yeah, you guys prefer length.

418
01:09:33,180 --> 01:09:45,180
Size doesn't matter. Length doesn't matter to me. I like them short and sweet.

419
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:58,180
There's nothing wrong with short and sweet, because they still pack a pretty big punch.

420
01:09:58,180 --> 01:10:02,180
I got them girthy burps.

421
01:10:02,180 --> 01:10:14,180
What do you mean that ain't a compliment?

422
01:10:14,180 --> 01:10:16,180
I'm not even, you know what?

423
01:10:16,180 --> 01:10:26,180
I try to be nice, because I'm telling the truth, but nobody cares.

424
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:29,180
Whatever. Whatever.

425
01:10:29,180 --> 01:10:32,180
You guys don't like me because I'm small. Fine.

426
01:10:32,180 --> 01:10:35,180
You guys don't like my small burps? Fine.

427
01:10:35,180 --> 01:10:39,180
Hi. Can I appreciate a small burp?

428
01:10:39,180 --> 01:10:44,180
And a large burp?

429
01:10:44,180 --> 01:10:48,180
Okay.

430
01:10:48,180 --> 01:10:56,180
I especially love these stinky burps.

431
01:10:56,180 --> 01:11:02,180
My Joker moment. I've had my Joker moment a long time ago.

432
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:15,180
What do you mean? Oh, I'm talking about burps.

433
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:28,180
Um, oh, let me continue. You are a lovely human being.

434
01:11:28,180 --> 01:11:33,180
Never forget that. I want you to try your hardest.

435
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:40,180
I want you to stop putting off that thing that you keep putting off and I want you to get to it and get it done.

436
01:11:40,180 --> 01:11:45,180
Because I know you'll feel so much better when you do.

437
01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:49,180
That thing that's been weighing in the back of your mind.

438
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:55,180
I want you to experience that sense of relief when you finally get it done.

439
01:11:55,180 --> 01:12:03,180
And that sense of achievement when you complete something.

440
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:15,180
Human being. You're my little mean. I'll flick you around.

441
01:12:15,180 --> 01:12:20,180
Do your homework. Get that project done.

442
01:12:20,180 --> 01:12:24,180
Send that text message. Make that phone call.

443
01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:36,180
Clean up your resume. Go to that interview. Send that email.

444
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:39,180
Have a good night.

445
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:49,180
Move that house. Pack up those boxes.

446
01:12:49,180 --> 01:13:02,180
Get right to it. I'll be cross with you if you don't finish the project.

447
01:13:02,180 --> 01:13:15,180
Kiss my seabee.

448
01:13:15,180 --> 01:13:20,180
Make sure you get that stuff done. You know?

449
01:13:20,180 --> 01:13:25,180
And then you can do all the fun stuff like hanging out with me or the other girls.

450
01:13:25,180 --> 01:13:30,180
And watching our streams and spending time with us.

451
01:13:30,180 --> 01:13:35,180
Okay? You got to do it.

452
01:13:35,180 --> 01:13:39,180
A good boy so listen to me.

453
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:43,180
A good boy so listen to mommy.

454
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:58,180
Okay? Good.

455
01:13:58,180 --> 01:14:02,180
You guys are so good to me. I'm so appreciative of you.

456
01:14:02,180 --> 01:14:08,180
I don't know what I would do without you to be honest.

457
01:14:08,180 --> 01:14:12,180
Thank you for always keeping me company.

458
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:15,180
Listening to me.

459
01:14:15,180 --> 01:14:24,180
And not just listening to me telling you what to do when you're actually having a conversation in my streams.

460
01:14:24,180 --> 01:14:31,180
I hope you guys like the new audio. That's the one I recorded last month so I hope I have some improvement.

461
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:40,180
October audios will be better because now I have fixed my microphone so it's not going to sound as bad.

462
01:14:41,180 --> 01:14:53,180
Can you even use it? I don't know what you mean.

463
01:14:53,180 --> 01:14:59,180
You fell asleep to it. Oh, you're nice.

464
01:14:59,180 --> 01:15:05,180
Good. Very good.

465
01:15:05,180 --> 01:15:14,180
I don't know what you're talking about.

466
01:15:14,180 --> 01:15:17,180
What day is it today?

467
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:26,180
Oh, Friday was yesterday.

468
01:15:26,180 --> 01:15:32,180
Today or next Friday?

469
01:15:32,180 --> 01:15:39,180
Hmm. Curious. Very curious.

470
01:15:39,180 --> 01:15:42,180
Okay.

471
01:15:42,180 --> 01:15:49,180
Are there some other triggers you guys wanted?

472
01:15:49,180 --> 01:15:53,180
Hmm?

473
01:15:53,180 --> 01:16:06,180
As you wish. Oh, for my birthday week, we're going to watch The Princess Bride, my favorite movie.

474
01:16:06,180 --> 01:16:16,180
I think I might finish. But then I'll wait for you guys next Friday to finish.

475
01:16:16,180 --> 01:16:20,180
I think that's fair.

476
01:16:20,180 --> 01:16:28,180
Princess Bride is my favorite movie of all time.

477
01:16:28,180 --> 01:16:40,180
Good girl. That's a good girl. Good girl.

478
01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:48,180
My two good girl watchers.

479
01:16:48,180 --> 01:16:57,180
You've never seen The Princess Bride. My God. What's wrong with you?

480
01:16:57,180 --> 01:17:02,180
I'm so sleepy.

481
01:17:02,180 --> 01:17:16,180
I wish I could take you guys to the couch with me and I could fall asleep like we did on the space.

482
01:17:16,180 --> 01:17:24,180
Oh, by the way, the end of the roleplay. I kill you and I eat you, by the way.

483
01:17:24,180 --> 01:17:29,180
Spoiler alert.

484
01:17:29,180 --> 01:17:39,180
Yeah. I'm like a spider. I eat.

485
01:17:39,180 --> 01:17:43,180
So warm.

486
01:17:43,180 --> 01:17:54,180
It's been so nice spending time with you, but I think it's time you leave now and end up in my tummy.

487
01:17:54,180 --> 01:18:00,180
Oh, you want to get beaten? I can tend. I don't really know how to do that.

488
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:07,180
I almost popped the microphone. Oh, wait, I know.

489
01:18:07,180 --> 01:18:13,180
That just sounds like I'm beating it off.

490
01:18:13,180 --> 01:18:17,180
Punch the mic. Punch the mic. Punch the mic. Punch the mic.

491
01:18:17,180 --> 01:18:22,180
You were the order. That's correct, actually.

492
01:18:22,180 --> 01:18:26,180
I like to play with my food before I eat it.

493
01:18:26,180 --> 01:18:28,180
Grab my hands.

494
01:18:28,180 --> 01:18:32,180
But I'm holding the 3DO, so I'm just going to smack my teeth in.

495
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:37,180
Whoa.

496
01:18:37,180 --> 01:18:39,180
Punch.

497
01:18:39,180 --> 01:18:47,180
Okay, I don't think I'm going to do that.

498
01:18:47,180 --> 01:18:50,180
That was really loud.

499
01:18:50,180 --> 01:18:55,180
Blackflake power. Okay, time to eat you.

500
01:18:55,180 --> 01:19:09,180
Oh.

501
01:19:09,180 --> 01:19:15,180
Oh, no. Wait, I need to be closer.

502
01:19:15,180 --> 01:19:19,180
Oh, my freckles.

503
01:19:19,180 --> 01:19:22,180
I can't get any closer than this.

504
01:19:22,180 --> 01:19:25,180
One of five.

505
01:19:25,180 --> 01:19:27,180
One of five.

506
01:19:27,180 --> 01:19:34,180
Ooh.

507
01:19:34,180 --> 01:19:41,180
Oh.

508
01:19:41,180 --> 01:19:47,180
Oh.

509
01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:55,180
This will give me a strike.

510
01:19:55,180 --> 01:20:11,180
Oh.

511
01:20:11,180 --> 01:20:13,180
You're being bored.

512
01:20:13,180 --> 01:20:42,180
Oh, my head's cut off. Don't worry about it.

513
01:20:42,180 --> 01:20:52,180
Oh.

514
01:20:52,180 --> 01:21:02,180
Oh.

515
01:21:02,180 --> 01:21:17,180
Oh, my head's cut off.

516
01:21:17,180 --> 01:21:32,180
Oh, my head's cut off.

517
01:21:32,180 --> 01:21:54,180
Oh, my head's cut off.

518
01:21:54,180 --> 01:22:15,180
I can also purr like a cat.

519
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:32,180
Oh, my head's cut off.

520
01:22:32,180 --> 01:22:48,180
If you're going to name these triggers, you can do sheebie purr and then sheebie parry.

521
01:22:48,180 --> 01:22:56,180
Yippee. Please YouTube, I'm not sucking pee pee. I'm just trying to move my model, I swear.

522
01:22:56,180 --> 01:23:01,180
Oh, my head's cut off.

523
01:23:01,180 --> 01:23:13,180
Oh, please hold.

524
01:23:13,180 --> 01:23:21,180
I'm so sleepy.

525
01:23:21,180 --> 01:23:26,180
Oh, I'm so tired.

526
01:23:26,180 --> 01:23:32,180
I am but a young innocent girl, and I'm so innocent.

527
01:23:32,180 --> 01:23:37,180
I'm not dressed a certain way asking for something.

528
01:23:37,180 --> 01:23:42,180
No, not at all.

529
01:23:42,180 --> 01:23:47,180
If you don't do it, I'll scurry you.

530
01:23:47,180 --> 01:24:04,180
I mean what?

531
01:24:04,180 --> 01:24:23,180
Oh, wait, what's that trigger that Para actually told me?

532
01:24:23,180 --> 01:24:52,180
That makes my tongue feel weird.

533
01:24:52,180 --> 01:25:18,180
You guys like that sound?

534
01:25:18,180 --> 01:25:35,180
That's actually me licking my top lip really fast.

535
01:25:35,180 --> 01:25:38,180
It's making me drool.

536
01:25:38,180 --> 01:25:44,180
It's good.

537
01:25:44,180 --> 01:25:55,180
Imagine, you can see my mouth will be like...

538
01:25:55,180 --> 01:25:59,180
My tongue tracking isn't fast enough.

539
01:25:59,180 --> 01:26:01,180
I need a burp.

540
01:26:01,180 --> 01:26:16,180
Every time I have seltzer water, it makes me burp. I mean die, Dr. Kelp.

541
01:26:16,180 --> 01:26:31,180
You like me even though I'm disgusting?

542
01:26:31,180 --> 01:26:39,180
Please? You love me? How much do you love me?

543
01:26:39,180 --> 01:26:52,180
Tell me now, tell me now, tell me now.

544
01:26:52,180 --> 01:26:59,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

545
01:26:59,180 --> 01:27:09,180
This much? You love me 1000? More than any, that's cool.

546
01:27:09,180 --> 01:27:14,180
You're lying. You're lying.

547
01:27:14,180 --> 01:27:18,180
You want me?

548
01:27:18,180 --> 01:27:22,180
I think you're dealing me.

549
01:27:22,180 --> 01:27:25,180
It's just time to be soon, someday.

550
01:27:25,180 --> 01:27:36,180
I am unbothered, soon the recipe.

551
01:27:36,180 --> 01:27:39,180
Like a wifey, think I'm wifey.

552
01:27:39,180 --> 01:27:44,180
You think I'm wifey?

553
01:27:44,180 --> 01:27:55,180
I'm blushing? No.

554
01:27:55,180 --> 01:28:01,180
No? I'm not blushing?

555
01:28:01,180 --> 01:28:12,180
I'm not doing anything.

556
01:28:12,180 --> 01:28:22,180
No?

557
01:28:22,180 --> 01:28:26,180
Wait for a poetic, I have to plan it.

558
01:28:26,180 --> 01:28:28,180
I won't be for it.

559
01:28:28,180 --> 01:28:35,180
I mean we're still, you know, we're still, we're still dating.

560
01:28:35,180 --> 01:28:38,180
I don't want to rush things.

561
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:41,180
I don't know about juice and things.

562
01:28:41,180 --> 01:28:43,180
You know what you don't know about me?

563
01:28:43,180 --> 01:28:46,180
We just need to grow together.

564
01:28:46,180 --> 01:28:50,180
There's a couple.

565
01:28:50,180 --> 01:29:00,180
My puppy is itchy.

566
01:29:00,180 --> 01:29:03,180
Actually I don't.

567
01:29:03,180 --> 01:29:07,180
You guys know way more about me than I do when you talk about me.

568
01:29:07,180 --> 01:29:10,180
Tell me something about yourself.

569
01:29:10,180 --> 01:29:14,180
That you're having cold.

570
01:29:14,180 --> 01:29:17,180
Or like you're usually scared to tell other people.

571
01:29:17,180 --> 01:29:20,180
Do it right now and chat with everybody watching.

572
01:29:20,180 --> 01:29:22,180
But you know.

573
01:29:22,180 --> 01:29:25,180
Welcome to Hyrule member.

574
01:29:25,180 --> 01:29:29,180
Welcome.

575
01:29:29,180 --> 01:29:35,180
Your position, really? That's cool.

576
01:29:35,180 --> 01:29:38,180
I can tie my own hands up. That's pretty neat.

577
01:29:38,180 --> 01:29:43,180
I like long walks on the beach and sometimes I have severe depression about what it's been a while.

578
01:29:43,180 --> 01:29:45,180
I feel that, bro. I feel that.

579
01:29:45,180 --> 01:29:49,180
If someone who has long-term dyspnea.

580
01:29:49,180 --> 01:29:50,180
Hope to see that.

581
01:29:50,180 --> 01:29:53,180
That's a given. You're neat.

582
01:29:53,180 --> 01:29:55,180
You have had a cold? Yeah.

583
01:29:55,180 --> 01:29:56,180
Very cool.

584
01:29:56,180 --> 01:29:58,180
Your eyes are so pretty.

585
01:29:58,180 --> 01:30:02,180
You have a beautiful, ony girlfriend.

586
01:30:02,180 --> 01:30:04,180
What is ony?

587
01:30:05,180 --> 01:30:08,180
Bro, please tell the story.

588
01:30:08,180 --> 01:30:11,180
I used to play in a band. What kind of band?

589
01:30:11,180 --> 01:30:14,180
I have 116 levels of room craft.

590
01:30:14,180 --> 01:30:17,180
I've never played a room escape, guys.

591
01:30:17,180 --> 01:30:22,180
I love things in my back.

592
01:30:22,180 --> 01:30:24,180
I like how you said that.

593
01:30:24,180 --> 01:30:27,180
You're afraid of flamingos. Why?

594
01:30:27,180 --> 01:30:31,180
My job might kill me eventually because I work with low level radiation.

595
01:30:31,180 --> 01:30:35,180
That's intense. You do intense work. That's impressive.

596
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:38,180
I'm Mexican? Sorry.

597
01:30:38,180 --> 01:30:41,180
I can think of anything secret that's positive.

598
01:30:41,180 --> 01:30:44,180
Or you can just, you don't have to say a secret.

599
01:30:44,180 --> 01:30:47,180
You can just say what you like to do.

600
01:30:47,180 --> 01:30:50,180
A little medical ward? That's cool.

601
01:30:50,180 --> 01:30:54,180
I start every year standing in the Atlantic Ocean at midnight for new years.

602
01:30:54,180 --> 01:30:56,180
That's super neat.

603
01:30:56,180 --> 01:30:59,180
I've done a polar plunge a couple of times.

604
01:30:59,180 --> 01:31:05,180
I get hit by old people daily at my job as someone who used to work in human services.

605
01:31:05,180 --> 01:31:08,180
I feel that.

606
01:31:08,180 --> 01:31:11,180
I am a Floridian. Get out of here.

607
01:31:11,180 --> 01:31:16,180
I collect arcade sticks. That's pretty cool.

608
01:31:16,180 --> 01:31:19,180
I learned English because of games and shows. That's pretty neat.

609
01:31:19,180 --> 01:31:23,180
A lot of people usually learn it from TV.

610
01:31:23,180 --> 01:31:27,180
I get good benefits. That's what you do.

611
01:31:27,180 --> 01:31:31,180
I invented a Mexican quantum computer.

612
01:31:31,180 --> 01:31:34,180
What the fuck? Einstein's in my chat right now. Holy shit.

613
01:31:34,180 --> 01:31:37,180
Good on you, bro. Thank you for the work you do.

614
01:31:37,180 --> 01:31:40,180
I could keep working, but I nearly broke my ankle last week.

615
01:31:40,180 --> 01:31:42,180
Oh, no.

616
01:31:42,180 --> 01:31:43,180
I live in Italy.

617
01:31:43,180 --> 01:31:46,180
Oh, Italia.

618
01:31:46,180 --> 01:31:48,180
Buongiorno.

619
01:31:48,180 --> 01:31:50,180
And bambino pizza.

620
01:31:50,180 --> 01:31:53,180
Sorry. I number 35 digits of pie.

621
01:31:53,180 --> 01:31:56,180
I can say the alphabet backwards in two seconds.

622
01:31:56,180 --> 01:31:58,180
I'm way smarter than me.

623
01:31:58,180 --> 01:32:03,180
I live in Illinois, and I have mental Illinois.

624
01:32:03,180 --> 01:32:06,180
I'm Mexican. I speak Spanish. I feel nude.

625
01:32:06,180 --> 01:32:11,180
Hey, man. I'm a Haitian. I can't speak Creole, so I feel that.

626
01:32:11,180 --> 01:32:15,180
I hold long conversations. I imagine people in my head saying,

627
01:32:15,180 --> 01:32:18,180
They like my fancy house. Hi, Miwa.

628
01:32:18,180 --> 01:32:20,180
Everyone say hi, Miwa.

629
01:32:20,180 --> 01:32:25,180
My wabby sister from another mista.

630
01:32:25,180 --> 01:32:28,180
I'm so lame compared to these.

631
01:32:28,180 --> 01:32:30,180
I have a bachelor's degree, but I haven't found a job.

632
01:32:30,180 --> 01:32:32,180
That's a bummer.

633
01:32:32,180 --> 01:32:35,180
I'm a federal agent who investigates male fraud.

634
01:32:35,180 --> 01:32:38,180
You know, it's really interesting learning a guy's jobs,

635
01:32:38,180 --> 01:32:40,180
because I'm just like,

636
01:32:40,180 --> 01:32:44,180
What has drawn you to anime girls on the internet?

637
01:32:44,180 --> 01:32:51,180
I got sponsored projects for a metal 3D printer for senior design.

638
01:32:51,180 --> 01:32:54,180
Can you get the gritty note?

639
01:32:54,180 --> 01:32:56,180
It's one of the most interesting things that I have in Fantasia.

640
01:32:56,180 --> 01:32:58,180
I think we talked about this last time.

641
01:32:58,180 --> 01:33:00,180
Are you the one with a Fantasia?

642
01:33:00,180 --> 01:33:02,180
Or is there somebody else with a Fantasia?

643
01:33:02,180 --> 01:33:04,180
I think it was somebody else with a Fantasia.

644
01:33:04,180 --> 01:33:07,180
There's a second person with a Fantasia in here.

645
01:33:07,180 --> 01:33:10,180
What's the ATF?

646
01:33:10,180 --> 01:33:13,180
I'm quite a moan and can't speak.

647
01:33:13,180 --> 01:33:16,180
They're hot? True.

648
01:33:16,180 --> 01:33:18,180
Oh, you know what?

649
01:33:18,180 --> 01:33:21,180
Tell me how you guys got into VTubers.

650
01:33:21,180 --> 01:33:25,180
Tell me, how did you get into VTubers?

651
01:33:25,180 --> 01:33:28,180
You want to know how I got into VTubers?

652
01:33:28,180 --> 01:33:34,180
I used to be into VTubers when they first came to existence.

653
01:33:34,180 --> 01:33:38,180
But the one time I decided I wanted to be a VTuber,

654
01:33:38,180 --> 01:33:44,180
was when I actually watched Anthony Padilla's video

655
01:33:44,180 --> 01:33:49,180
interviewing Iron Mouse and some other VTubers.

656
01:33:49,180 --> 01:33:52,180
And it actually made me want to try to be a VTuber.

657
01:33:52,180 --> 01:33:54,180
But I watched them.

658
01:33:54,180 --> 01:33:57,180
But that's how I decided I wanted to be one.

659
01:33:57,180 --> 01:33:59,180
How Alive? Yeah?

660
01:33:59,180 --> 01:34:02,180
How did you get into How Alive? How did you find out?

661
01:34:02,180 --> 01:34:04,180
COVID?

662
01:34:04,180 --> 01:34:06,180
Oh, I won the COVID babies.

663
01:34:06,180 --> 01:34:09,180
COVID VTuber babies.

664
01:34:09,180 --> 01:34:11,180
Okay.

665
01:34:11,180 --> 01:34:14,180
Kitsune AI?

666
01:34:14,180 --> 01:34:16,180
Kizuna?

667
01:34:16,180 --> 01:34:18,180
Do I have an Oshi?

668
01:34:18,180 --> 01:34:21,180
My Oshi is graduating tomorrow.

669
01:34:21,180 --> 01:34:24,180
My comedy Oshi.

670
01:34:24,180 --> 01:34:26,180
Sand.

671
01:34:26,180 --> 01:34:30,180
Everybody knows my Oshi is chilly.

672
01:34:30,180 --> 01:34:34,180
I'm very sad.

673
01:34:34,180 --> 01:34:37,180
But she is going to do great things.

674
01:34:37,180 --> 01:34:40,180
She's such a wonderful person.

675
01:34:40,180 --> 01:34:43,180
She's really talented.

676
01:34:43,180 --> 01:34:46,180
She graduates the eighth.

677
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:48,180
Pillow Deer?

678
01:34:48,180 --> 01:34:50,180
I just got in the Pillow Deer.

679
01:34:50,180 --> 01:34:52,180
She's really good.

680
01:34:52,180 --> 01:34:55,180
I want to take her ASMR 101 class.

681
01:34:55,180 --> 01:34:58,180
Nene Amano Senju Linga.

682
01:34:58,180 --> 01:35:01,180
Pikami!

683
01:35:01,180 --> 01:35:04,180
Pikami, sweet.

684
01:35:04,180 --> 01:35:07,180
Very cool.

685
01:35:07,180 --> 01:35:09,180
Yeah.

686
01:35:09,180 --> 01:35:11,180
Yeah, it's a bummer.

687
01:35:11,180 --> 01:35:14,180
But I hope, you know,

688
01:35:14,180 --> 01:35:16,180
I want her to do what she loves

689
01:35:16,180 --> 01:35:19,180
and what makes her happy.

690
01:35:19,180 --> 01:35:22,180
She's very light.

691
01:35:22,180 --> 01:35:25,180
How do you know she's your first VTuber?

692
01:35:25,180 --> 01:35:27,180
Oh, nice.

693
01:35:27,180 --> 01:35:29,180
I must speak with the other girls.

694
01:35:29,180 --> 01:35:32,180
I'm a standard normal office worker.

695
01:35:32,180 --> 01:35:35,180
How does it feel being in comedy?

696
01:35:35,180 --> 01:35:38,180
Baking in comedy? I haven't baked a comedy Oshi.

697
01:35:38,180 --> 01:35:42,180
When somebody said that I was a comedy Oshi,

698
01:35:42,180 --> 01:35:44,180
oh my god, I'm going to cry thinking of it.

699
01:35:44,180 --> 01:35:46,180
Especially some of my friends,

700
01:35:46,180 --> 01:35:48,180
like Mari and Poman, told me I'm a comedy Oshi

701
01:35:48,180 --> 01:35:50,180
and I literally wanted to cry

702
01:35:50,180 --> 01:35:53,180
because I feel like I'm not good enough for that.

703
01:35:53,180 --> 01:35:55,180
Honor.

704
01:35:55,180 --> 01:35:58,180
So, yeah.

705
01:35:58,180 --> 01:36:00,180
It's very crazy.

706
01:36:00,180 --> 01:36:03,180
I can't see past my tears.

707
01:36:03,180 --> 01:36:06,180
I want my eyes.

708
01:36:13,180 --> 01:36:16,180
Of course you are good.

709
01:36:16,180 --> 01:36:18,180
Thank you, Miwa.

710
01:36:18,180 --> 01:36:19,180
Thank you.

711
01:36:19,180 --> 01:36:21,180
I'm trying my best out here.

712
01:36:21,180 --> 01:36:23,180
Just like I hope you guys are.

713
01:36:23,180 --> 01:36:28,180
I just want to make everybody happy.

714
01:36:28,180 --> 01:36:30,180
Oh, thank you.

715
01:36:30,180 --> 01:36:33,180
Thank you guys for deciding that I'm good enough

716
01:36:33,180 --> 01:36:37,180
to support or really be your first, et cetera.

717
01:36:37,180 --> 01:36:39,180
I'm not the impressive VTubing.

718
01:36:39,180 --> 01:36:41,180
I have a lot to learn.

719
01:36:41,180 --> 01:36:44,180
I discovered that actually out of Vilaire,

720
01:36:44,180 --> 01:36:48,180
I'm the one with the least experience

721
01:36:48,180 --> 01:36:50,180
writing a VTuber.

722
01:36:50,180 --> 01:36:54,180
Everybody else has been doing it much longer than I have been.

723
01:36:54,180 --> 01:36:57,180
They have a couple of years on me.

724
01:36:57,180 --> 01:37:00,180
Although I know Strani hasn't been a VTuber for long either,

725
01:37:00,180 --> 01:37:05,180
but she has a lot more content creation under her belt than me.

726
01:37:05,180 --> 01:37:10,180
So I kind of feel like a baby in Vilaire for that reason.

727
01:37:10,180 --> 01:37:13,180
It's kind of funny.

728
01:37:18,180 --> 01:37:20,180
Thank you guys.

729
01:37:20,180 --> 01:37:22,180
VTubers.

730
01:37:22,180 --> 01:37:25,180
Well, just the VTubers.

731
01:37:25,180 --> 01:37:30,180
I think they've all streamed longer than me too, actually.

732
01:37:31,180 --> 01:37:33,180
Okay.

733
01:37:39,180 --> 01:37:42,180
Yeah, Mumay believed in me.

734
01:37:42,180 --> 01:37:48,180
She saw herself in me, which is a major honor.

735
01:37:48,180 --> 01:37:51,180
So she's grooming me to be her.

736
01:37:51,180 --> 01:37:56,180
To try to be entertaining.

737
01:37:56,180 --> 01:37:59,180
I feel like I'm getting better.

738
01:37:59,180 --> 01:38:01,180
I want to be great.

739
01:38:01,180 --> 01:38:03,180
I want to be up there with the greats.

740
01:38:03,180 --> 01:38:05,180
I want to have a good influence.

741
01:38:05,180 --> 01:38:09,180
I'm kind of bummed because sometimes my big mouth gets me in trouble.

742
01:38:09,180 --> 01:38:13,180
And I say things that, again, I can be really blunt.

743
01:38:13,180 --> 01:38:16,180
And I know that can turn people away,

744
01:38:16,180 --> 01:38:20,180
but I'm just going to try to keep going and keep my head down.

745
01:38:20,180 --> 01:38:24,180
And, you know, speak my mind in a more tactful way.

746
01:38:25,180 --> 01:38:30,180
I've got a word choice.

747
01:38:30,180 --> 01:38:33,180
Nope, she's grooming me.

748
01:38:33,180 --> 01:38:36,180
I might be on my ears.

749
01:38:36,180 --> 01:38:38,180
I'm a baby.

750
01:38:38,180 --> 01:38:45,180
I'm a baby at the age of 56, turning 57, September 28.

751
01:38:49,180 --> 01:38:51,180
Yeah, but I've already mentioned before,

752
01:38:51,180 --> 01:38:53,180
my big mouth gets Vilaire in trouble.

753
01:38:53,180 --> 01:38:55,180
Well, not in trouble, just like,

754
01:38:55,180 --> 01:38:59,180
I don't want to reflect badly on them.

755
01:38:59,180 --> 01:39:02,180
No, that'll still be open with you.

756
01:39:02,180 --> 01:39:05,180
What are you talking about?

757
01:39:05,180 --> 01:39:09,180
I'm not going to stop being open.

758
01:39:09,180 --> 01:39:12,180
Yeah, refined communication skills.

759
01:39:12,180 --> 01:39:16,180
I still have to remember I'm someone with a platform, you know?

760
01:39:16,180 --> 01:39:19,180
And, you know, what I say.

761
01:39:19,180 --> 01:39:23,180
I was talking with my parents about it today.

762
01:39:23,180 --> 01:39:25,180
They're like, oh, what's been going on?

763
01:39:25,180 --> 01:39:28,180
And I'm like, well, I have my period and I want to die.

764
01:39:28,180 --> 01:39:32,180
Two, I might have made a couple mistakes

765
01:39:32,180 --> 01:39:36,180
because I realized I don't know how to carry myself properly on the internet.

766
01:39:36,180 --> 01:39:40,180
And sometimes you have to learn the hard way.

767
01:39:40,180 --> 01:39:44,180
Yeah, I can answer my own string at some point.

768
01:39:45,180 --> 01:39:51,180
So, what did my dad say?

769
01:39:51,180 --> 01:39:56,180
I forget, he said something very wise in the old that you never get.

770
01:40:00,180 --> 01:40:08,180
But yeah, I never stopped learning my mouth's a feature.

771
01:40:08,180 --> 01:40:09,180
Oh, yeah.

772
01:40:15,180 --> 01:40:17,180
You like my little hawk-tua?

773
01:40:17,180 --> 01:40:21,180
If she don't hawk-tua, I don't talk to a hawk-tua.

774
01:40:24,180 --> 01:40:28,180
Yeah, just like, pretty much, I was just like, ah, brainwaves.

775
01:40:28,180 --> 01:40:35,180
I feel like I'm just kind of letting everybody down with my based opinions.

776
01:40:35,180 --> 01:40:38,180
And my dad's like, you take too much, you put too much stock

777
01:40:38,180 --> 01:40:43,180
and what other people say and think about you, you really got to take care of yourself.

778
01:40:43,180 --> 01:40:46,180
And I'm like, bet, father, bet!

779
01:40:46,180 --> 01:40:49,180
He said it more wisely than that, but you know.

780
01:40:51,180 --> 01:40:53,180
Hawk-tua!

781
01:40:53,180 --> 01:40:55,180
Hawk-tua!

782
01:40:55,180 --> 01:40:57,180
Why can't I say hawk-tua?

783
01:41:00,180 --> 01:41:02,180
I hate your brainworms.

784
01:41:14,180 --> 01:41:16,180
Gonna record, yeah.

785
01:41:16,180 --> 01:41:18,180
I just need to find out.

786
01:41:18,180 --> 01:41:21,180
I'm guys, I'm so busy preparing stuff.

787
01:41:21,180 --> 01:41:23,180
Oh my god, I almost dropped the ASMR mic.

788
01:41:23,180 --> 01:41:26,180
Okay, wait, I'm so busy preparing.

789
01:41:26,180 --> 01:41:28,180
And I haven't been feeling good.

790
01:41:30,180 --> 01:41:34,180
Shark Week is kicking me in my coochie.

791
01:41:37,180 --> 01:41:40,180
My dad is awesome and so is my mom.

792
01:41:40,180 --> 01:41:47,180
My mom is like, because my mom used to work in a very corporate environment

793
01:41:47,180 --> 01:41:51,180
and she's just like, you know, you just go, you're about yourself.

794
01:41:51,180 --> 01:42:00,180
And my mom is like, you know, people will always have this idea of you

795
01:42:00,180 --> 01:42:03,180
and you can try to change their minds.

796
01:42:03,180 --> 01:42:08,180
But in the end, it's like people are gonna think of how they want to think

797
01:42:08,180 --> 01:42:13,180
and you can't get worked up and upset over something you can't control.

798
01:42:13,180 --> 01:42:17,180
Because again, I have a thing with control.

799
01:42:17,180 --> 01:42:22,180
And my mama, um, my mama, it's funny.

800
01:42:22,180 --> 01:42:29,180
I used to, when I was younger, I used to, because I just wanted to be a British child, apparently.

801
01:42:29,180 --> 01:42:32,180
My mom said, I used to always call her mumsie.

802
01:42:32,180 --> 01:42:34,180
I mean, I don't have mumsie.

803
01:42:35,180 --> 01:42:39,180
And every time she picked me up from my after school program.

804
01:42:45,180 --> 01:42:49,180
Yeah, my parents keep my hand on my shoulders a hundred percent.

805
01:42:51,180 --> 01:42:53,180
I speak Spanish.

806
01:42:53,180 --> 01:42:56,180
No, no habla español.

807
01:42:57,180 --> 01:43:01,180
And, um,

808
01:43:01,180 --> 01:43:03,180
muy,

809
01:43:03,180 --> 01:43:05,180
en familia,

810
01:43:05,180 --> 01:43:08,180
en español,

811
01:43:08,180 --> 01:43:10,180
en perdido.

812
01:43:12,180 --> 01:43:13,180
Good.

813
01:43:15,180 --> 01:43:16,180
Oh, no, man.

814
01:43:16,180 --> 01:43:21,180
My Spanish gets mixed up, too, with my friends.

815
01:43:22,180 --> 01:43:24,180
You're gonna take me for free?

816
01:43:24,180 --> 01:43:26,180
Hey, do you want to go and dozing?

817
01:43:30,180 --> 01:43:32,180
What was that?

818
01:43:51,180 --> 01:43:53,180
Thank you.

819
01:44:05,180 --> 01:44:07,180
Was that a didgeridoo?

820
01:44:14,180 --> 01:44:18,180
Does that sound like I'm going to go and dozing?

821
01:44:21,180 --> 01:44:24,180
That's me just pressing on my voice box.

822
01:44:30,180 --> 01:44:32,180
That sounds bad.

823
01:44:32,180 --> 01:44:33,180
I probably shouldn't do that.

824
01:44:33,180 --> 01:44:36,180
My voice is cracking now.

825
01:44:36,180 --> 01:44:38,180
Yard work day is somewhere in win.

826
01:44:38,180 --> 01:44:41,180
He's not ready to do a thing.

827
01:44:41,180 --> 01:44:43,180
Squidward, that's a read.

828
01:44:43,180 --> 01:44:46,180
Don't get your throat off.

829
01:44:47,180 --> 01:44:51,180
That's the language of the tree.

830
01:44:51,180 --> 01:44:53,180
I'm tired.

831
01:44:55,180 --> 01:44:57,180
It sounds like somebody's even possessed.

832
01:45:04,180 --> 01:45:06,180
Okay, sorry.

833
01:45:09,180 --> 01:45:11,180
Nightmare, nightmare, nightmare.

834
01:45:11,180 --> 01:45:13,180
Nightmare, nightmare, nightmare.

835
01:45:13,180 --> 01:45:15,180
Nightmare, nightmare, nightmare.

836
01:45:15,180 --> 01:45:17,180
Nightmare, nightmare, nightmare.

837
01:45:17,180 --> 01:45:19,180
Nightmare, nightmare, nightmare.

838
01:45:19,180 --> 01:45:20,180
I have a crazy voice range.

839
01:45:20,180 --> 01:45:22,180
Can you believe that?

840
01:45:24,180 --> 01:45:26,180
I just laughed like a monkey.

841
01:45:26,180 --> 01:45:28,180
Nightmare, nightmare, nightmare.

842
01:45:28,180 --> 01:45:30,180
Nightmare, nightmare, nightmare.

843
01:45:30,180 --> 01:45:33,180
Nightmare, nightmare, nightmare.

844
01:45:33,180 --> 01:45:35,180
Nightmare, nightmare, nightmare.

845
01:45:37,180 --> 01:45:40,180
Sound of a teenager at the do-all-work.

846
01:45:46,180 --> 01:45:49,180
She wonders why people are gone, because I make monkey noises.

847
01:45:56,180 --> 01:45:58,100
ooh o-ooh o-okay

848
01:46:00,020 --> 01:46:02,640
ooh o-ok

849
01:46:07,980 --> 01:46:09,480
wow

850
01:46:10,120 --> 01:46:12,760
wow

851
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:19,260
y5 no艾

852
01:46:20,840 --> 01:46:21,940
okay

853
01:46:21,940 --> 01:46:34,840
I was making oop oop oop oop O goths

854
01:46:34,840 --> 01:46:35,860
Еs really impressed

855
01:46:35,860 --> 01:46:36,840
SHABURAEO

856
01:46:36,840 --> 01:46:49,920
58

857
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:53,920
Or, or, ultimately.

858
01:46:53,920 --> 01:46:59,920
Wait, I didn't think that somebody, somebody,

859
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:04,920
Right here! It's like, Sheavey should start worrying about being white!

860
01:47:04,920 --> 01:47:10,920
Nothing!

861
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:14,920
No, Sheave.

862
01:47:14,920 --> 01:47:19,920
No!

863
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:22,920
Mo!

864
01:47:22,920 --> 01:47:24,920
I'm making...

865
01:47:24,920 --> 01:47:25,920
Shoad?

866
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:28,920
It sounds like chode!

867
01:47:28,920 --> 01:47:32,920
I'm making voices!

868
01:47:32,920 --> 01:47:35,920
You know, people ask me, Sheavey,

869
01:47:35,920 --> 01:47:39,920
Does it hurt to maintain this voice when you go this high?

870
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:43,920
It actually doesn't. It's actually quite easy for me to do.

871
01:47:44,920 --> 01:47:48,920
And then...

872
01:47:48,920 --> 01:47:53,920
There should be an interview chat, chat, chat, chat, chat, chat, chat!

873
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:59,920
I don't know why it's on Eastern European.

874
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:06,920
RIP SLEEPER!

875
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:14,920
I think I got off from policy. I never watched that!

876
01:48:14,920 --> 01:48:18,920
And then, you know, I had a little bit of rasp to it,

877
01:48:18,920 --> 01:48:24,920
And then, you know, you got your little smug piece of shit!

878
01:48:24,920 --> 01:48:27,920
I just got really high.

879
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:30,920
I mean, oh, it's because my AC is off.

880
01:48:30,920 --> 01:48:35,920
So that makes sense.

881
01:48:35,920 --> 01:48:38,920
I sound like Pipa!

882
01:48:38,920 --> 01:48:44,920
No, I don't think so.

883
01:48:44,920 --> 01:48:49,920
If you're hot, cool off, I just dump my seltzer water on me.

884
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:54,920
Although, I will say, I very much identify with Pipa's tan version.

885
01:48:54,920 --> 01:48:57,920
I'm like, me.

886
01:48:57,920 --> 01:49:02,920
Her little tan outfit.

887
01:49:02,920 --> 01:49:07,920
I think it's cute with those little tan lines.

888
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:10,920
I'm like, oh, it's like Pipa!

889
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:13,920
Pipa, no!

890
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:15,920
No.

891
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:18,920
It's just tan.

892
01:49:18,920 --> 01:49:21,920
She'd be in Pipa collab when double buttons.

893
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:24,920
She would never collab with me, guys.

894
01:49:24,920 --> 01:49:29,920
I don't think anyone from FaZe would ever collab with us.

895
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:40,920
I used to have a baby when I saw them.

896
01:49:40,920 --> 01:49:47,920
If you could see one of the girls collab with someone from FaZe, who would it be?

897
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:50,920
Like, who would you pair Emmy up with?

898
01:49:50,920 --> 01:49:58,920
Or IC?

899
01:49:58,920 --> 01:50:00,920
You don't know about that?

900
01:50:00,920 --> 01:50:04,920
You don't know about that?

901
01:50:04,920 --> 01:50:08,920
You're right, I don't. That's true.

902
01:50:08,920 --> 01:50:11,920
I see you're seeing it.

903
01:50:11,920 --> 01:50:14,920
Emmy would be the first.

904
01:50:14,920 --> 01:50:19,920
Emmy gets along with everyone.

905
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:22,920
I kind of agree with you that they won't collab with you.

906
01:50:22,920 --> 01:50:26,920
Thank you.

907
01:50:26,920 --> 01:50:29,920
You know, I forgot to put the chat up for LaVaude.

908
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:35,920
I'm sorry, LaVaude Watchers.

909
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:38,920
David and Colin.

910
01:50:38,920 --> 01:50:40,920
Perfect voice for Clonny Sheenby.

911
01:50:40,920 --> 01:50:49,920
You guys want Clonny Sheenby so bad.

912
01:50:49,920 --> 01:50:55,920
Who would you want to make?

913
01:50:55,920 --> 01:51:00,920
I don't even know, like, if I were to get a model, who would I have to do the model?

914
01:51:00,920 --> 01:51:11,920
You know?

915
01:51:11,920 --> 01:51:15,920
You and Pippa have a similar sense of humor.

916
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:20,920
Yeah, we do.

917
01:51:20,920 --> 01:51:27,920
I think, like, Romeo and Juliet, our fan bases would want to keep us apart.

918
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:32,920
I feel like that goes for a lot of people.

919
01:51:32,920 --> 01:51:36,920
I know there's, like, some people that you guys don't want us to, like, associate with.

920
01:51:36,920 --> 01:51:40,920
I've had people in my marriage be like, you responded to this person's tweet.

921
01:51:40,920 --> 01:51:42,920
Please be careful.

922
01:51:42,920 --> 01:51:52,920
And I'm like, I just responded like the tweet.

923
01:51:52,920 --> 01:51:54,920
I'd like to see you collab with Doki.

924
01:51:54,920 --> 01:51:56,920
Doki, you know?

925
01:51:56,920 --> 01:52:06,920
I want to have Doki teach me how to do a pep.

926
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:12,920
You think Waifu Baby's designer would make that Clonny Sheenby?

927
01:52:12,920 --> 01:52:13,920
No, no, no.

928
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:15,920
If I...

929
01:52:15,920 --> 01:52:23,920
Me and Shiori.

930
01:52:23,920 --> 01:52:31,920
I can't.

931
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:38,920
I can't.

932
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:47,920
God girls with runny mascara.

933
01:52:47,920 --> 01:52:49,920
Shondo?

934
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:50,920
Tell me.

935
01:52:50,920 --> 01:52:53,920
I like Shondo.

936
01:52:53,920 --> 01:53:00,920
She'd be at Shiori and Shiori could probably up about books for hours.

937
01:53:00,920 --> 01:53:05,920
I love me some running mascara.

938
01:53:05,920 --> 01:53:07,920
Oh yeah, no, I died.

939
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:08,920
I died.

940
01:53:08,920 --> 01:53:09,920
I don't have 3D debut.

941
01:53:09,920 --> 01:53:14,920
I was like, oh.

942
01:53:14,920 --> 01:53:15,920
I could tell you more.

943
01:53:15,920 --> 01:53:23,920
No, I couldn't.

944
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:36,920
If I were to get a cute and funny model, what model artist would you guys recommend?

945
01:53:36,920 --> 01:53:38,920
Hypothetically?

946
01:53:38,920 --> 01:53:40,920
No?

947
01:53:40,920 --> 01:53:47,920
No?

948
01:53:47,920 --> 01:53:49,920
So good.

949
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:52,920
I do love so good.

950
01:53:52,920 --> 01:53:54,920
They open their...

951
01:53:54,920 --> 01:54:01,920
What you might call it soon, actually?

952
01:54:01,920 --> 01:54:10,920
I am the Brat and the Brats theme.

953
01:54:10,920 --> 01:54:11,920
I mean, what has it probably been?

954
01:54:11,920 --> 01:54:14,920
Oh, I wear this look before for my rental model.

955
01:54:14,920 --> 01:54:17,920
They were absolutely so sweet and kind.

956
01:54:17,920 --> 01:54:20,920
And they made exactly what I wanted.

957
01:54:20,920 --> 01:54:29,920
I would definitely work with Valkyrie again.

958
01:54:29,920 --> 01:54:32,920
I don't know if Brie would rig for us.

959
01:54:32,920 --> 01:54:36,920
It's very difficult to find an artist in rigor.

960
01:54:36,920 --> 01:54:43,920
That's okay with the nature of the side content we do in terms of our patriarchal ideas.

961
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:49,920
I wouldn't want to make anybody comfortable if I end up using a model.

962
01:54:49,920 --> 01:54:51,920
And I don't like the content I'm associated with.

963
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:54,920
I don't know if that person is one of them.

964
01:54:54,920 --> 01:54:59,920
But I just want to make sure everyone is comfortable.

965
01:54:59,920 --> 01:55:13,920
Yeah.

966
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:24,920
I have a headache.

967
01:55:24,920 --> 01:55:33,920
That's another reason why I kind of don't reach out for collapse anymore.

968
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:40,920
I now just ask permission if people are allowed to hang out with us because of the nature of our side content.

969
01:55:40,920 --> 01:55:44,920
And I'd rather be like, hey, you want to collab and do this, this, and that.

970
01:55:44,920 --> 01:55:46,920
And they're like, no.

971
01:55:46,920 --> 01:55:49,920
And I'm just like, hey, you have firms to hang out with us.

972
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:50,920
It's like they can't even make.

973
01:55:50,920 --> 01:55:52,920
And they're just like, yes.

974
01:55:52,920 --> 01:55:54,920
Or they're like, no.

975
01:55:54,920 --> 01:55:58,920
And I'm like, okay.

976
01:55:58,920 --> 01:56:04,920
That's why I hang out with a lot of indies.

977
01:56:04,920 --> 01:56:06,920
But I'm okay with that.

978
01:56:06,920 --> 01:56:08,920
I want people to be comfortable.

979
01:56:08,920 --> 01:56:21,920
I don't want to make anybody uncomfortable.

980
01:56:21,920 --> 01:56:24,920
Oh, it's because of my.

981
01:56:24,920 --> 01:56:37,920
Because my ASMR microphone is on my phone number.

982
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:41,920
Model my signal from me.

983
01:56:41,920 --> 01:56:42,920
Yeah.

984
01:56:42,920 --> 01:56:44,920
That's for permission.

985
01:56:45,920 --> 01:56:50,920
Like melody.

986
01:56:50,920 --> 01:56:52,920
No.

987
01:56:52,920 --> 01:56:57,920
Okay.

988
01:56:57,920 --> 01:56:59,920
That's why you can collaborate.

989
01:56:59,920 --> 01:57:11,920
Well, they're just like, like, yeah, some people also, you know, will sometimes view collapse as a business relationship.

990
01:57:11,920 --> 01:57:15,920
And because we're smaller, some people wouldn't want to collab with us.

991
01:57:15,920 --> 01:57:22,920
Me, I like to view stuff as just like, hey, I think your content is me and you seem like a cool person.

992
01:57:22,920 --> 01:57:24,920
Do you want to hang out?

993
01:57:24,920 --> 01:57:30,920
I don't care how big or small you are, but I got it.

994
01:57:30,920 --> 01:57:33,920
Oh, I took the risk of colliding with them.

995
01:57:33,920 --> 01:57:34,920
I think AI too.

996
01:57:34,920 --> 01:57:36,920
Dream collaboration.

997
01:57:36,920 --> 01:57:41,920
That would be cool.

998
01:57:41,920 --> 01:57:43,920
Yeah.

999
01:57:43,920 --> 01:57:44,920
Same purpose.

1000
01:57:44,920 --> 01:57:47,920
Well, it'll probably still happen.

1001
01:57:47,920 --> 01:57:50,920
But guys, guys, guys, anytime.

1002
01:57:50,920 --> 01:57:52,920
It's not, no, no, no, no, it's not judgmental.

1003
01:57:52,920 --> 01:57:54,920
It's not judgmental.

1004
01:57:54,920 --> 01:57:56,920
It's not, no, no, no.

1005
01:57:56,920 --> 01:57:58,920
It's not judgmental.

1006
01:57:58,920 --> 01:58:00,920
It's not the people.

1007
01:58:00,920 --> 01:58:11,920
It's just like, for example, like, like some stuff in other countries, they can't do this, this or that.

1008
01:58:11,920 --> 01:58:13,920
Like it's branding.

1009
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:14,920
It's just business.

1010
01:58:14,920 --> 01:58:16,920
It's nothing personal.

1011
01:58:16,920 --> 01:58:22,920
Nobody, yeah, preconceived notions.

1012
01:58:22,920 --> 01:58:27,920
And, you know, yeah, there might be a little bit of that.

1013
01:58:27,920 --> 01:58:35,920
But, well, you know.

1014
01:58:35,920 --> 01:58:48,920
But I think people kind of now have a general idea because now more of the time I see more people disappointed that we don't do certain things than us doing certain things.

1015
01:58:48,920 --> 01:58:50,920
Um, generally, someone's like, what?

1016
01:58:50,920 --> 01:58:59,920
They're not, you know, on the cat website?

1017
01:58:59,920 --> 01:59:02,920
Were they, you know, bait those cats?

1018
01:59:02,920 --> 01:59:09,920
Um, and we're like, no, let me just audio.

1019
01:59:09,920 --> 01:59:13,920
No, no.

1020
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:14,920
Yeah, exactly.

1021
01:59:14,920 --> 01:59:16,920
It's all branding stuff, guys.

1022
01:59:16,920 --> 01:59:19,920
Nothing personal.

1023
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:33,920
Yeah, I'm saying myself, um, I'm actually, I think, because I reached out to a company, like a big girl, and I asked like questions and it had them explain stuff to me.

1024
01:59:33,920 --> 01:59:44,920
So another company was kind enough to explain stuff to me as to like why certain companies may not be able to collaborate.

1025
01:59:44,920 --> 01:59:48,920
And that made me feel a lot better their transparency.

1026
01:59:48,920 --> 01:59:54,920
Um, so now I actually don't feel bad about it anymore because I'm just like, people hate us!

1027
01:59:54,920 --> 01:59:55,920
Wow!

1028
01:59:55,920 --> 01:59:57,920
But they don't.

1029
01:59:57,920 --> 01:59:59,920
They don't hate us.

1030
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:04,920
Yes, you know, it's just a lot of stuff, business stuff.

1031
02:00:04,920 --> 02:00:09,920
So now I just do my own thing, you know, with my girly pops.

1032
02:00:09,920 --> 02:00:17,920
Also, keep in mind, we have like, more petite body types in our company, and some people don't like that either, so.

1033
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:20,920
I, you know, respectful.

1034
02:00:20,920 --> 02:00:24,920
There's no ill will, nobody hates us.

1035
02:00:24,920 --> 02:00:26,920
It's fine.

1036
02:00:26,920 --> 02:00:27,920
We're just hanging out.

1037
02:00:27,920 --> 02:00:30,920
We're just, we're carving a path, exactly.

1038
02:00:30,920 --> 02:00:36,920
Who knows, maybe next year, there'll be another company just like us, and maybe it'll be more normalized.

1039
02:00:36,920 --> 02:00:39,920
And maybe we'll hang out with those people.

1040
02:00:42,920 --> 02:00:44,920
I'm using the word petite.

1041
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:52,920
If you look right, no, it's fine.

1042
02:00:52,920 --> 02:00:54,920
Guys, don't worry.

1043
02:00:54,920 --> 02:00:55,920
Don't worry.

1044
02:00:55,920 --> 02:01:03,920
Although, Estonia's told me there has been some like, big names interested in us, and she's like, very honest.

1045
02:01:04,920 --> 02:01:07,920
And they would be pretenders to the throne.

1046
02:01:07,920 --> 02:01:09,920
I need to turn on the light.

1047
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:13,920
I like how this turned into a zatsu.

1048
02:01:13,920 --> 02:01:15,920
I'm so sorry.

1049
02:01:17,920 --> 02:01:20,920
I swear, I talk too much.

1050
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:23,920
I'm sorry.

1051
02:01:24,920 --> 02:01:26,920
Boom.

1052
02:01:27,920 --> 02:01:29,920
Okay.

1053
02:01:30,920 --> 02:01:33,920
I need to turn on the AC.

1054
02:01:34,920 --> 02:01:36,920
Moomi is so fat.

1055
02:01:39,920 --> 02:01:41,920
Your voice is pretty talk more.

1056
02:01:41,920 --> 02:01:43,920
No, you, Miwa.

1057
02:01:43,920 --> 02:01:45,920
Miwa.

1058
02:01:45,920 --> 02:01:47,920
Miwa, are we gonna hang out, actually?

1059
02:01:47,920 --> 02:01:48,920
I should probably.

1060
02:01:48,920 --> 02:01:49,920
I was like, thinking about that today.

1061
02:01:49,920 --> 02:01:51,920
I saw you post on Twitter.

1062
02:01:51,920 --> 02:01:55,920
Oh yeah, Miwa has a new ASMR video out.

1063
02:01:55,920 --> 02:01:58,920

1064
02:01:58,920 --> 02:02:00,920

1066
02:02:02,920 --> 02:02:04,920
And I was, so I saw that post.

1067
02:02:04,920 --> 02:02:08,920
I'm like, you know, I should probably like, actually make a collab with Miwa.

1068
02:02:09,920 --> 02:02:11,920
Besides just like an ASMR.

1069
02:02:11,920 --> 02:02:13,920
Like we should probably actually hang out.

1070
02:02:18,920 --> 02:02:19,920
I didn't get, no.

1071
02:02:19,920 --> 02:02:22,920
I'm just going to give memberships.

1072
02:02:23,920 --> 02:02:24,920
Hey, Goober.

1073
02:02:24,920 --> 02:02:30,920
Um, I don't know if you'll have an actual AB to Bacopo's competitors or friendly rivals.

1074
02:02:31,920 --> 02:02:33,920
Yeah, that's a great question.

1075
02:02:33,920 --> 02:02:40,920
Um, I would hope to be friends with another English.

1076
02:02:40,920 --> 02:02:45,920
We're not even really, we're not really an AB to Bacopo anymore.

1077
02:02:45,920 --> 02:02:47,920
Because we just do well.

1078
02:02:47,920 --> 02:02:48,920
Yes.

1079
02:02:49,920 --> 02:02:51,920
Do the House of Blue Streams count?

1080
02:02:51,920 --> 02:02:52,920
No.

1081
02:02:53,920 --> 02:02:54,920
I don't know.

1082
02:02:54,920 --> 02:02:55,920
Anyways, um.

1083
02:02:57,920 --> 02:02:58,920
Alright.

1084
02:02:59,920 --> 02:03:00,920
Thank you for the 10 gifts.

1085
02:03:00,920 --> 02:03:01,920

02:03:23,920 --> 02:03:25,920
Thank you for the gift.

1099
02:03:25,920 --> 02:03:28,920
Thank you for the gift and no one's special.

And Miwa, thank you for the five gifts.

1101

Oops, thank you.

1103
02:03:38,920 --> 02:03:41,920
It was Miwa's plan all along.

1104
02:03:42,920 --> 02:03:43,920
I obey women.

1105
02:03:43,920 --> 02:03:45,920
Hello, I'm right here.

1106
02:03:46,920 --> 02:03:47,920

Yeah, I guess the cunny.

1109
02:03:57,920 --> 02:03:59,920
The cunny really just rules.

1110
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:02,920
Yeah, it's funny.

1111
02:04:02,920 --> 02:04:03,920

02:04:12,920 --> 02:04:14,920
Imagine if I got like a cute and funny model

You didn't have to do that.

1140
02:05:12,920 --> 02:05:14,920
You guys are too kind today.

1141
02:05:16,920 --> 02:05:18,920

I did not put them on the rest of my schedule

1171

So yeah, I was so busy this month.

1199
02:08:06,920 --> 02:08:09,920

My birthday.

1205
02:08:18,920 --> 02:08:20,920
It's like, I'm just like my parents,

1206
02:08:20,920 --> 02:08:22,920
my parents and they have people over.

1207
02:08:22,920 --> 02:08:24,920
They don't just like hang out and enjoy the company.

1208
02:08:24,920 --> 02:08:27,920
They like have to make sure everybody's having a great time,

1209
02:08:27,920 --> 02:08:29,920
like constantly and I'm just like that.

1210
02:08:29,920 --> 02:08:32,920
Even if it's an event to like celebrate me,

1211
02:08:32,920 --> 02:08:33,920
I just want to, you know,

1212
02:08:33,920 --> 02:08:34,920
I want to make it,

1213
02:08:34,920 --> 02:08:36,920
I want to make it about all of us.

1214
02:08:36,920 --> 02:08:41,920
Cause again, I wouldn't be able to do this stuff without you.

1215
02:08:43,920 --> 02:08:44,920
Yeah.

1216
02:08:44,920 --> 02:08:45,920
We didn't watch Megan.

1217
02:08:45,920 --> 02:08:46,920
Yeah.

1218
02:08:46,920 --> 02:08:47,920
We can do it in October.

1219
02:08:47,920 --> 02:08:48,920
That's a good idea.

1220
02:08:48,920 --> 02:08:50,920
Maybe for, um,

1221
02:08:52,920 --> 02:08:55,920

1222
02:08:56,920 --> 02:08:57,920
in, um,

1223
02:08:59,920 --> 02:09:00,920
October.

1224
02:09:01,920 --> 02:09:04,920
Maybe I'll do like one normal members

1225
02:09:04,920 --> 02:09:06,920
and then I'll do a watchable.

1226
02:09:10,920 --> 02:09:11,920
It's funny.

1227
02:09:11,920 --> 02:09:13,920
I asked my dad, um,

1228
02:09:14,920 --> 02:09:15,920
I'm like, you know,

1229
02:09:15,920 --> 02:09:16,920

02:09:16,920 --> 02:09:17,920
I told him, I'm like,

1231
02:09:17,920 --> 02:09:18,920
you know, the alien movie was really good,

1232
02:09:18,920 --> 02:09:19,920
the Romulus.

1233
02:09:19,920 --> 02:09:20,920
And I'm like,

1234
02:09:20,920 --> 02:09:22,920
I really wish you came and saw it with me.

1235
02:09:22,920 --> 02:09:23,920
You would have liked it.

1236
02:09:23,920 --> 02:09:24,920
He's like, you know,

1237
02:09:24,920 --> 02:09:25,920
it's really funny.

1238
02:09:25,920 --> 02:09:26,920
And I'm like,

1239
02:09:26,920 --> 02:09:27,920
he's like,

1240
02:09:27,920 --> 02:09:28,920
when I was on the trip with your mom,

1241
02:09:28,920 --> 02:09:31,920
we, I literally just binge watched all the alien movie.

1242
02:09:32,920 --> 02:09:33,920
And I'm like,

1243
02:09:33,920 --> 02:09:34,920
I thought they scared you.

1244
02:09:34,920 --> 02:09:35,920
He's like,

1245
02:09:36,920 --> 02:09:39,920
they actually don't scare me as much as I thought they did.

1246
02:09:42,920 --> 02:09:43,920
And I'm like,

1247
02:09:43,920 --> 02:09:44,920
is this a thing again?

1248
02:09:44,920 --> 02:09:46,920
Like when mom was like gremlins is super scary,

1249
02:09:46,920 --> 02:09:48,920
but then she watched it when she was a kid.

1250
02:09:48,920 --> 02:09:49,920
So it was so much scary.

1251
02:09:49,920 --> 02:09:50,920
He's like, yeah.

1252
02:09:52,920 --> 02:09:53,920
So he's gonna,

1253
02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:54,920
um,

1254
02:09:54,920 --> 02:09:57,920
when it comes out on like on demand video or like,

1255
02:09:58,920 --> 02:09:59,920
I don't know,

1256
02:09:59,920 --> 02:10:00,920
like Google Netflix or whatever,

1257
02:10:00,920 --> 02:10:02,920
I'll go over and watch it.

1258
02:10:04,920 --> 02:10:05,920
And he says,

1259
02:10:05,920 --> 02:10:06,920
stretch clothes at least three out.

1260
02:10:06,920 --> 02:10:07,920
I am.

1261
02:10:09,920 --> 02:10:10,920
Um,

1262
02:10:10,920 --> 02:10:11,920
I, yeah,

1263
02:10:11,920 --> 02:10:12,920
I sent Strani all the info

1264
02:10:12,920 --> 02:10:13,920
because I talked about

1265
02:10:13,920 --> 02:10:15,920
some of you guys who aren't members,

1266
02:10:15,920 --> 02:10:16,920
you're missing out

1267
02:10:16,920 --> 02:10:18,920
because I talked with the members

1268
02:10:18,920 --> 02:10:20,920
and they helped me pick more Dorothon goals.

1269
02:10:21,920 --> 02:10:22,920
So yeah,

1270
02:10:22,920 --> 02:10:23,920
so you guys can get what you want.

1271
02:10:24,920 --> 02:10:26,920
And Strani is surprising me with the merch thing

1272
02:10:26,920 --> 02:10:27,920
that I don't know about.

1273
02:10:27,920 --> 02:10:28,920
She's like, can you guess?

1274
02:10:28,920 --> 02:10:29,920
And I'm like,

1275
02:10:29,920 --> 02:10:30,920
oh, in the hole?

1276
02:10:30,920 --> 02:10:31,920
And she's like, no.

1277
02:10:31,920 --> 02:10:32,920
And I'm like, damn it.

1278
02:10:39,920 --> 02:10:40,920
But yeah,

1279
02:10:40,920 --> 02:10:42,920
I'm getting birthday merch.

1280
02:10:42,920 --> 02:10:43,920
Just like,

1281
02:10:43,920 --> 02:10:45,920
just like Azura did.

1282
02:10:45,920 --> 02:10:46,920
I just don't know.

1283
02:10:46,920 --> 02:10:47,920
I'm getting,

1284
02:10:47,920 --> 02:10:48,920
um,

1285
02:10:48,920 --> 02:10:50,920
I don't know what I'm getting though.

1286
02:10:50,920 --> 02:10:52,920
I think I'm getting a mouse pad,

1287
02:10:52,920 --> 02:10:54,920
but I think there's something else,

1288
02:10:54,920 --> 02:10:56,920
but she won't tell me what it is.

1289
02:10:58,920 --> 02:10:59,920
Um,

1290
02:11:00,920 --> 02:11:01,920
so it's not,

1291
02:11:01,920 --> 02:11:02,920
sadly, no.

1292
02:11:03,920 --> 02:11:04,920
A cup?

1293
02:11:04,920 --> 02:11:05,920
No, I have to,

1294
02:11:05,920 --> 02:11:06,920
in order for,

1295
02:11:06,920 --> 02:11:07,920
one,

1296
02:11:07,920 --> 02:11:09,920
I would want a cup of all of us on it.

1297
02:11:09,920 --> 02:11:10,920
Um,

1298
02:11:10,920 --> 02:11:12,920
in order for us to get a cup,

1299
02:11:12,920 --> 02:11:14,920
we have to have a certain amount of,

1300
02:11:14,920 --> 02:11:15,920
um,

1301
02:11:15,920 --> 02:11:16,920
merch.

1302
02:11:16,920 --> 02:11:17,920
Slime Sheeby,

1303
02:11:17,920 --> 02:11:18,920
oh.

1304
02:11:18,920 --> 02:11:20,920
If Strani surprises me

1305
02:11:21,920 --> 02:11:22,920
with

1306
02:11:23,920 --> 02:11:25,920
Slime Sheeby merch,

1307
02:11:26,920 --> 02:11:29,920
even though I don't even have a Slime Sheeby design,

1308
02:11:33,920 --> 02:11:35,920
that would be pretty neat.

1309
02:11:37,920 --> 02:11:38,920
Madam have seen a para,

1310
02:11:38,920 --> 02:11:39,920
well,

1311
02:11:39,920 --> 02:11:40,920
what para do?

1312
02:11:40,920 --> 02:11:42,920
The para makes slimer?

1313
02:11:44,920 --> 02:11:45,920
What do you mean?

1314
02:11:45,920 --> 02:11:46,920
Say it.

1315
02:11:46,920 --> 02:11:48,920
Say it with your chest.

1316
02:11:52,920 --> 02:11:53,920
Hmm,

1317
02:11:53,920 --> 02:11:55,920
is there possibly,

1318
02:11:55,920 --> 02:11:57,920
is there possibly an event where,

1319
02:11:57,920 --> 02:11:58,920
if we use Code Sheeby,

1320
02:11:58,920 --> 02:11:59,920
we get free shipping?

1321
02:11:59,920 --> 02:12:02,920
So crazy that you say that.

1322
02:12:02,920 --> 02:12:04,920
Truly crazy.

1323
02:12:05,920 --> 02:12:06,920
Cause boy,

1324
02:12:07,920 --> 02:12:10,920
do I have the product for you.

1325
02:12:11,920 --> 02:12:13,920
If you use Code Sheeby

1326
02:12:14,920 --> 02:12:16,920
on gamer subs,

1327
02:12:16,920 --> 02:12:18,920
if you're feeling thirsty,

1328
02:12:18,920 --> 02:12:19,920
in the need of energy,

1329
02:12:19,920 --> 02:12:21,920
and you don't want stinky coffee,

1330
02:12:22,920 --> 02:12:25,920
you can use my Code Sheeby

1331
02:12:27,920 --> 02:12:29,920
to get free shipping worldwide.

1332
02:12:29,920 --> 02:12:30,920
And look,

1333
02:12:30,920 --> 02:12:32,920
I'm on the anime Girl Thigh.

1334
02:12:33,920 --> 02:12:34,920
Come,

1335
02:12:34,920 --> 02:12:37,920
you can get my lovely Milky Tail Thigh

1336
02:12:40,920 --> 02:12:41,920
for free shipping.

1337
02:12:43,920 --> 02:12:44,920
Yeah,

1338
02:12:44,920 --> 02:12:45,920
worldwide,

1339
02:12:45,920 --> 02:12:46,920
Mr. Worldwide.

1340
02:12:48,920 --> 02:12:49,920
You see.

1341
02:12:49,920 --> 02:12:50,920
Oops.

1342
02:12:53,920 --> 02:12:54,920
Funnub,

1343
02:12:54,920 --> 02:12:55,920
if you enjoyed,

1344
02:12:55,920 --> 02:12:58,920
please consider subscribing to my channel.

1345
02:12:58,920 --> 02:13:00,920
I know there was a lot of yak

1346
02:13:00,920 --> 02:13:02,920
the last 30 minutes

1347
02:13:02,920 --> 02:13:05,920
to an hour off the stream.

1348
02:13:05,920 --> 02:13:07,920
I apologize for the rod watchers

1349
02:13:07,920 --> 02:13:09,920
if that bothers you.

1350
02:13:10,920 --> 02:13:11,920
But you know,

1351
02:13:11,920 --> 02:13:13,920
somebody will probably do the,

1352
02:13:15,920 --> 02:13:17,920
what's it called,

1353
02:13:17,920 --> 02:13:18,920
the timestamps,

1354
02:13:18,920 --> 02:13:20,920
so it'll be a bolder tell.

1355
02:13:21,920 --> 02:13:23,920
You say hi rod watchers,

1356
02:13:23,920 --> 02:13:24,920
but they can't see you

1357
02:13:24,920 --> 02:13:26,920
cause they don't have the chat up.

1358
02:13:28,920 --> 02:13:29,920
Perik of maggots,

1359
02:13:29,920 --> 02:13:30,920
delicious.

1360
02:13:32,920 --> 02:13:33,920
You know,

1361
02:13:33,920 --> 02:13:35,920
I have some crickets I can eat.

1362
02:13:36,920 --> 02:13:37,920
I bought crickets

1363
02:13:38,920 --> 02:13:39,920
to consume

1364
02:13:39,920 --> 02:13:40,920
as a

1365
02:13:41,920 --> 02:13:43,920
donut thong thing.

1366
02:13:44,920 --> 02:13:47,920
How many people are subscribed to you?

1367
02:13:47,920 --> 02:13:49,920
A couple are the ones who aren't.

1368
02:13:49,920 --> 02:13:50,920
I have no idea.

1369
02:13:51,920 --> 02:13:52,920
Hi,

1370
02:13:52,920 --> 02:13:53,920
rod watchers.

1371
02:13:53,920 --> 02:13:54,920
Live chat says hi.

1372
02:13:56,920 --> 02:13:58,920
Adam Yaffe is my life force.

1373
02:13:58,920 --> 02:13:59,920
Adam is the...

1374
02:14:01,920 --> 02:14:02,920
Hi,

1375
02:14:02,920 --> 02:14:03,920
rod watchers.

1376
02:14:03,920 --> 02:14:04,920
Looking at like,

1377
02:14:04,920 --> 02:14:05,920
oh yeah,

1378
02:14:05,920 --> 02:14:06,920
we got a live chat replay.

1379
02:14:07,920 --> 02:14:09,920
Rod watchers use code chibi.

1380
02:14:09,920 --> 02:14:10,920
Okay,

1381
02:14:10,920 --> 02:14:11,920
I'm fading.

1382
02:14:11,920 --> 02:14:12,920
I think,

1383
02:14:12,920 --> 02:14:14,920
because I forgot to take my meds today.

1384
02:14:15,920 --> 02:14:16,920
Oh my God,

1385
02:14:16,920 --> 02:14:18,920
why am I feeling busy and loopy?

1386
02:14:19,920 --> 02:14:21,920
Oh, why didn't you take my medication?

1387
02:14:24,920 --> 02:14:25,920
What time is it?

1388
02:14:26,920 --> 02:14:28,920
I also woke up at like 7 a.m.

1389
02:14:29,920 --> 02:14:30,920
and I went to bed at 1.

1390
02:14:32,920 --> 02:14:33,920
All the sugar wearing off.

1391
02:14:33,920 --> 02:14:34,920
I didn't have sugar.

1392
02:14:34,920 --> 02:14:35,920
Actually,

1393
02:14:35,920 --> 02:14:36,920
I had pop rock.

1394
02:14:37,920 --> 02:14:39,920
Did he do me forgiving you?

1395
02:14:39,920 --> 02:14:40,920
Oh yeah,

1396
02:14:40,920 --> 02:14:41,920
he's forgiven me.

1397
02:14:41,920 --> 02:14:42,920
I squeezed his pouch.

1398
02:14:48,920 --> 02:14:50,920
Boomi's getting so chunky.

1399
02:14:50,920 --> 02:14:51,920
I'm like,

1400
02:14:51,920 --> 02:14:52,920
actually,

1401
02:14:52,920 --> 02:14:53,920
no,

1402
02:14:53,920 --> 02:14:54,920
but it's funny because like,

1403
02:14:54,920 --> 02:14:55,920
he's not like a lazy cat.

1404
02:14:55,920 --> 02:14:57,920
He's very active as you guys heard in the beginning.

1405
02:14:57,920 --> 02:15:00,920
It's just that he takes the other cat's food.

1406
02:15:00,920 --> 02:15:01,920
I'm like,

1407
02:15:01,920 --> 02:15:02,920
bro,

1408
02:15:02,920 --> 02:15:03,920
stop.

1409
02:15:03,920 --> 02:15:06,920
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1410
02:15:06,920 --> 02:15:07,920
I know.

1411
02:15:07,920 --> 02:15:08,920
Hi.

1412
02:15:08,920 --> 02:15:09,920
I'm easy.

1413
02:15:11,920 --> 02:15:12,920
He's bulky.

1414
02:15:12,920 --> 02:15:14,920
Do you mean his crippled sister's food?

1415
02:15:14,920 --> 02:15:15,920
Sure.

1416
02:15:16,920 --> 02:15:18,920
And food from a 14-year-old woman.

1417
02:15:19,920 --> 02:15:21,920
That sounds weird in the context of...

1418
02:15:22,920 --> 02:15:23,920
She's a cat.

1419
02:15:23,920 --> 02:15:24,920
She's a 14-year-old cat.

1420
02:15:24,920 --> 02:15:25,920
Right now, it's 14.

1421
02:15:26,920 --> 02:15:27,920
I know.

1422
02:15:27,920 --> 02:15:28,920
I know.

1423
02:15:28,920 --> 02:15:29,920
I know.

1424
02:15:29,920 --> 02:15:30,920
I know.

1425
02:15:30,920 --> 02:15:31,920
I know.

1426
02:15:31,920 --> 02:15:32,920
And my brain is 14.

1427
02:15:34,920 --> 02:15:35,920
I'm looking at her though.

1428
02:15:35,920 --> 02:15:36,920
She looks,

1429
02:15:36,920 --> 02:15:39,920
she looks like at the youthful age of five.

1430
02:15:41,920 --> 02:15:42,920
Call her active.

1431
02:15:42,920 --> 02:15:43,920
They won't wear collars.

1432
02:15:43,920 --> 02:15:45,920
You will probably have a fit.

1433
02:15:47,920 --> 02:15:49,920
Being a force it needs your help.

1434
02:15:52,920 --> 02:15:54,920
14 years,

1435
02:15:54,920 --> 02:15:55,920
yeah,

1436
02:15:55,920 --> 02:15:57,920
it's like 80 cat ears.

1437
02:15:59,920 --> 02:16:00,920
Yeah.

1438
02:16:00,920 --> 02:16:05,920
Yeah, I don't know. She's very spry for her age.

1439
02:16:08,520 --> 02:16:11,420
I've had her for a very long, very, very long time

1440
02:16:11,420 --> 02:16:14,920
since I was only, I only believed in her.

1441
02:16:19,420 --> 02:16:20,920
Oh, that was the other two.

1442
02:16:26,020 --> 02:16:29,920
To 21? Damn, yes, I think cats can live a long time

1443
02:16:30,920 --> 02:16:33,920
However, she does have some health issues.

1444
02:16:33,920 --> 02:16:35,920
Like she has kidney disease.

1445
02:16:35,920 --> 02:16:38,920
So, um, but she's still, she's still going strong.

1446
02:16:38,920 --> 02:16:40,920
She's still, she's still kicking.

1447
02:16:41,920 --> 02:16:43,920
That was Boomi. Boomi was going crazy.

1448
02:16:44,920 --> 02:16:47,920
He decided that that was the time to have the Zoomies.

1449
02:16:49,920 --> 02:16:54,920
And then I was just like, oh wait, let me see if he needs these weapons before I start to train.

1450
02:16:54,920 --> 02:16:57,920
And then she drops, she pees for like two minutes straight

1451
02:16:57,920 --> 02:16:59,920
and then she drops in Miley's poop.

1452
02:16:59,920 --> 02:17:02,920
And I'm like, damn, Ma.

1453
02:17:02,920 --> 02:17:05,920
And I said, I have to give her another bath tomorrow.

1454
02:17:05,920 --> 02:17:07,920
She's stinking.

1455
02:17:10,920 --> 02:17:12,920
She's stinking.

1456
02:17:12,920 --> 02:17:14,920
She's stinking.

1457
02:17:28,920 --> 02:17:31,920
Okay, I'm going to raid Serenity.

1458
02:17:31,920 --> 02:17:33,920
I hope she's still streaming, but it's her birthday.

1459
02:17:33,920 --> 02:17:35,920
So she's probably still streaming.

1460
02:17:35,920 --> 02:17:40,920
So go say, funny birthday raid because, you know, she's a fellow bun.

1461
02:17:40,920 --> 02:17:43,920
It's also her birthday month.

1462
02:17:43,920 --> 02:17:46,920
So yeah, Serenity's birthday.

1463
02:17:46,920 --> 02:17:49,920
So go give her some love.

1464
02:17:51,920 --> 02:17:53,920
Now I'm going to go take my meds.

1465
02:17:53,920 --> 02:17:57,920
And then nap for a couple of hours.

1466
02:17:57,920 --> 02:18:01,920
And then beep, beep, and then actually go to sleep because I am tired.

1467
02:18:02,920 --> 02:18:05,920
Well, have a good rest of your night.

1468
02:18:05,920 --> 02:18:07,920
I care about you.

1469
02:18:08,920 --> 02:18:12,920
I hope you guys have a good rest of your day.

1470
02:18:12,920 --> 02:18:15,920
I hope you guys enjoy the stream.

1471
02:18:15,920 --> 02:18:17,920
Not too much.

1472
02:18:26,920 --> 02:18:27,920
Go finish something.

1473
02:18:27,920 --> 02:18:28,920
Go finish it.

1474
02:18:28,920 --> 02:18:30,920
Go finish that project.

1475
02:18:30,920 --> 02:18:31,920
Not that project.

1476
02:18:31,920 --> 02:18:32,920
The other one.

1477
02:18:32,920 --> 02:18:33,920
Okay.

1478
02:18:34,920 --> 02:18:39,920
Anyway, I said bonnichiwa this morning.

1479
02:18:39,920 --> 02:18:42,920
Siam bian bun, yeah?

1480
02:18:42,920 --> 02:18:44,920
I just sound like a terrible weeb.

1481
02:18:44,920 --> 02:18:46,920
Okay, bye.
