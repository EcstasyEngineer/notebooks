1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You

2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You

3
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You

4
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You

5
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:41,640
Okay, hold on. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. My 3d. Oh

6
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:53,440
I tested everything before I started I tested everything this is my normal microphone

7
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,980
I was gonna whisper for some reason

8
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:01,020
My scarlet isn't working, so I'm trying to trouble you

9
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:06,380
But don't worry we're going to really get it

10
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,860
So just give me a moment. I

11
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,780
Apologize I literally have been ready for over an hour

12
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:21,180
Over an hour and then it decided I don't understand

13
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,300
I

14
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:29,700
Think my cat might have unblocked my scarlet from my computer hold on

15
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,300
I

16
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,420
Know it doesn't mean

17
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,300
I

18
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,180
I

19
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,180
I

20
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,180
Quiet

21
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,620
Okay

22
00:06:51,180 --> 00:07:00,780
You might

23
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,140
You might hear my cat

24
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,060
Munching in the background

25
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,860
There's a lot of home you hear something

26
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:24,540
I'm going to commit

27
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,700
So

28
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,060
Okay

29
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,660
I

30
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,900
Don't

31
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,660
Kind of frustrated

32
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,140
Scarlet

33
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:25,140
I have to get like really in there, don't I?

34
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,140
Okay.

35
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,140
Hello, darlings.

36
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,140
Headphones are maxed.

37
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:48,140
Anyone as you go says you can't do me.

38
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,140
Okay.

39
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:54,140
Listen, I'm doing the post down here.

40
00:08:54,140 --> 00:09:04,140
A little different because if you have a certain type of headphones, it may not work.

41
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:14,140
Alright, I'm on my keyboard.

42
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:18,140
I'm picking up the 3DO.

43
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,140
Okay.

44
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:37,140
I don't really care because I think this would be really funny.

45
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:48,140
It was really fun messing around with the settings on the VTube studio.

46
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:54,140
My neighbors are walking by and they're being very loud.

47
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:57,140
Good luck on your exam.

48
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:04,140
Alright, so I thank you.

49
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:08,140
Thank you for meeting me at the bar.

50
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:21,140
I'm happy that you followed directions in my Tinder message that I sent to you.

51
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:30,140
Because I sent you directions to this bar, don't worry that there's nobody else here.

52
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:37,140
I especially reserved it for the both of us.

53
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:47,140
I hope you don't mind what I don't know what a big bumping up is.

54
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:54,140
I generally don't know why it's doing that.

55
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:59,140
It's a big bar, but don't worry about anyone else.

56
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:03,140
It's just me and you.

57
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,140
I'm not rich.

58
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:10,140
Why do you think I'm bartending behind this bar right now?

59
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:15,140
I'm sorry I had to burp, but I didn't want to burp in your ear.

60
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,140
Unless you want me to.

61
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:22,140
But I'll be a professional madam for you tonight.

62
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:30,140
So my darling, what would you like to drink?

63
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:34,140
I can make you something.

64
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:44,140
If you're under the age of drinking, I can also make you a mocktail if you'd like.

65
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,140
I've been studying.

66
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,140
I'm going to forgive you a little bit.

67
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:52,140
I don't know, Mike.

68
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:55,140
You want chalky milk?

69
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,140
I can make you chalky milk.

70
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:02,140
I almost went out and bought Vanta because I realized I had an advantage in a decade.

71
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:05,140
Madam, your neck, don't worry about my neck.

72
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,140
I still got that, though.

73
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:12,140
And don't you forget it.

74
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:15,140
So you'd like some cold water.

75
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:21,140
You'd like dark coke, bloody Mary, strawberry milk.

76
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:25,140
So no head.

77
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:29,140
You'd like a bloody Mary, non-alcoholic.

78
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,140
Okay.

79
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:36,140
I have some lemonade and I have strawberry milk.

80
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,140
Get out of here.

81
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,140
I love oil.

82
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:42,140
What is wrong with you people?

83
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,140
Coke milk?

84
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,140
Yes.

85
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,140
I am milking.

86
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:50,140
Is there a buyer in the bar?

87
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,140
A shipping aid?

88
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:54,140
Yes, that can be arranged.

89
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,140
A bucket of soda.

90
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,140
Got some bleach.

91
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,140
Yeah, I got some bleach.

92
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:02,140
I also have some ammonia as well.

93
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:07,140
But yeah, don't worry that there's nobody else here.

94
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,140
It's just me and you tonight.

95
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:14,140
Okay, I'm going to take very good, very good care of you.

96
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:18,140
All right, let me get some ice.

97
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,140
All right, let me get some ice.

98
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,140
Let's come right here.

99
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,140
All right, go.

100
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,140
I have some ice.

101
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,140
I have no idea.

102
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,140
I had to go to the back.

103
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,140
I had to step away for a moment.

104
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:09,140
In fact, I have to, hold on.

105
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,140
I have to step away.

106
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,140
I have to step away to do it.

107
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:20,140
Let me just, I can't part.

108
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,140
I'm trying really hard and I can't.

109
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,140
Because I know the microphone.

110
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:27,140
I'll pick it up.

111
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:32,140
But I also have some ice.

112
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,140
I have a nice setup.

113
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,140
Not long.

114
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,140
I am.

115
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,140
You know, I worked really hard.

116
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,140
I don't, hold on.

117
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,140
I'm like very tall.

118
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:43,140
Let me just, sorry.

119
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,140
Do you know how to share it?

120
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,140
Don't worry.

121
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,140
I run very fine establishments.

122
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:51,140
This is a bar within Wonderland Hotel.

123
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:56,140
So, one long island ice tea.

124
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,140
All right.

125
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,140
Coming right up, you know.

126
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:03,140
No one would want to like about ice though.

127
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,140
I like about ice.

128
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:39,140
Wow, that was like really, my teeth are sensitive.

129
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:42,140
I just, I live, I live dangerously.

130
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:45,140
I live very dangerously.

131
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:48,140
I can't go over like this or that.

132
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,140
We can ask for crushed ice, oh well.

133
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:52,140
That's the only type of ice we serve.

134
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:54,140
Hold on, let me crush it again for you.

135
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:27,140
There, I spit it right into the glass for you.

136
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:31,140
So, take a sip of that.

137
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,140
What do you mean?

138
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:36,140
You don't, you need a drink to go with it.

139
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:40,140
Okay, let me, let me pour you something then, hold on.

140
00:16:48,140 --> 00:17:03,140
Okay.

141
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,140
My favorite ambiance is here.

142
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:16,140
It's my, it's my, my AC has made its arrival.

143
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:31,140
I'm so happy I put a towel down because it just smells drinkable.

144
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,140
Is it monster?

145
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:42,140
No, it's not do.

146
00:17:42,140 --> 00:18:08,140
Because, you know, I got some out due because I'm going to mount it to you later.

147
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:21,140
So it's only fair.

148
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:36,140
The candle, oh god.

149
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:51,140
All right, here, let me come out from behind the bar.

150
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:55,140
Yeah, I teleported, whatever.

151
00:18:55,140 --> 00:19:15,140
So, uh, the effects are really nice.

152
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:19,140
So, do you like my outfit?

153
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:22,140
Only, you know, a torso.

154
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:25,140
But do you like it?

155
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,140
Uh, don't mind that.

156
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:33,140
I'm not attached to my back.

157
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:37,140
Don't worry about it.

158
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:40,140
Don't worry.

159
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:51,140
I was like, so ready to be so serious.

160
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:55,140
And then I was messing around with all this stuff this morning.

161
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:58,140
And I couldn't stop laughing.

162
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:17,140
I don't know why my fingers break.

163
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:24,140
There we go.

164
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:38,140
Does that work for you?

165
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:44,140
Do not be afraid.

166
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:47,140
You are safe with me, my dear.

167
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:51,140
My cat is climbing on my monitor.

168
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:58,140
Hold on.

169
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:07,140
My love, my god, please get down.

170
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,140
Don't worry about it.

171
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:13,140
Okay.

172
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:18,140
She's like, was that only climbing over everything?

173
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:40,140
You guys like me, like, is this okay with you?

174
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:47,140
Like, what sucks is that when I turn to the side, it just disconnects.

175
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:50,140
Don't use it.

176
00:21:50,140 --> 00:22:03,140
Okay.

177
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:11,140
I got a new cup, and it's like textured.

178
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:16,140
I'm very happy with it.

179
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:24,140
It makes really nice taps.

180
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:36,140
Do you want to sip out of my cup?

181
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:44,140
I'll give you a little taste, but only if you behave.

182
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,140
What do I have in my cup?

183
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:52,140
It's just tea.

184
00:22:52,140 --> 00:23:01,140
It's just green tea in here, but I'm going to make myself a drink in a moment.

185
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:06,140
I'm going to show you tea.

186
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:30,140
I'll crouch over you when you can open your mouth.

187
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:56,140
Okay, if you say shippity toilet, I'm literally going to sick of my mods on you.

188
00:23:56,140 --> 00:24:08,140
I swear to God.

189
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:12,140
We're not 12, and if you are 12, well, fuck are you here?

190
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:39,140
Get the fuck out of here, you little bitch.

191
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:43,140
I hope that you're having a good day today.

192
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:57,140
Thank you for swiping right on me, on my Tinder profile.

193
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:03,140
We're going to have this nightcap, and I guess maybe, but just maybe.

194
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:08,140
Hopefully I can keep my head on my shoulders.

195
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:17,140
You can come back to my place.

196
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:40,140
I don't know German, but cool story.

197
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:50,140
My head was attached in my pictures, but sometimes you kind of get a little crazy with it.

198
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:53,140
Sometimes it's good to lose your head.

199
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:55,140
Said it would be an old woman.

200
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,140
His maintenance still there.

201
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:06,140
Yeah, he's died up in my closet.

202
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,140
Did you hear his screams?

203
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:12,140
I stuffed my panties in his mouth.

204
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:51,140
I can make you guys whimper.

205
00:26:51,140 --> 00:27:01,140
Do you want me to make you whimper?

206
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:03,140
Pop the bag.

207
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:18,140
Can you bag for a moment?

208
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:30,140
Are you tingling yet?

209
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:35,140
Do you want me to make you whimper?

210
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:43,140
I can give her a really strong drink.

211
00:27:43,140 --> 00:28:12,140
In fact, actually, I need to pour myself a drink before I get to work on you.

212
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:36,140
I'm a little bad at it.

213
00:28:36,140 --> 00:29:05,140
I'm going to grab some peach tea from the bird.

214
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:16,140
I don't know why.

215
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:29,140
I don't want to go in.

216
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:31,140
I don't want to go in.

217
00:29:31,140 --> 00:30:00,140
I don't want to go in.

218
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:13,140
So there's three steps I have to take.

219
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:42,140
First step is pouring the peach tea.

220
00:30:42,140 --> 00:31:11,140
I'm going to pour the peach tea.

221
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:25,140
I hope your hands are where they should be on your desk.

222
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:34,140
No, my ass is not as superior as Strone's.

223
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:54,140
So the second step is to pour the Jack Daniels.

224
00:31:54,140 --> 00:32:11,140
I hope you're being good.

225
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:38,140
I don't know what happens if you're being bad.

226
00:32:38,140 --> 00:33:07,140
I don't know what happens if you're being bad.

227
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:33,140
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

228
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:46,140
I just need to get a new candle burner.

229
00:33:46,140 --> 00:34:07,140
Okay, so I'm going to get them to open up more.

230
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:36,140
I wish you could wake up over here and give me your clothes.

231
00:34:36,140 --> 00:35:05,140
I wish you could wake up over here and give me your clothes.

232
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:35,140
I wish you could wake up over here and give me your clothes.

233
00:35:35,140 --> 00:36:04,140

236
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:27,140
I wish you could wake up over here and give me your clothes.

237
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:40,140
I wish you could open that candle burner.

238
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:52,140
I don't know why I'm struggling.

I don't know why I'm struggling.

576

I don't know why I'm struggling.

578
03:07:52,140 --> 03:08:21,140
I don't know why I'm struggling.

579
03:08:23,140 --> 03:08:34,140
I don't know why I'm struggling.

580
03:08:34,140 --> 03:08:39,140
My head disconnected from my body.

581
03:08:39,140 --> 03:08:49,140
Do you know how long it took me to actually, because like in order to have one of these outfits on, you have to make every layer transparent.

582
03:08:49,140 --> 03:08:56,140
And I didn't know how many parts of my model that there were that my rigor had to cut up and animate.

583
03:08:56,140 --> 03:09:06,140
I don't know why I'm struggling.

584
03:09:06,140 --> 03:09:16,140
I don't know why I'm struggling.

585
03:09:16,140 --> 03:09:26,140
I don't know why I'm struggling.

586
03:09:26,140 --> 03:09:37,140
Yeah, because like, you know, all like all the Shibari ropes on my model, on my body are all individually cut.

587
03:09:37,140 --> 03:09:44,140
They're all separate pieces along with the rings and the shadows are all separated.

588
03:09:44,140 --> 03:09:50,140
I was like, and then I understood why Strani paid so much money.

589
03:09:50,140 --> 03:10:02,140
Like, if you know anything about live 2D and rigging, I personally would look at the file and be like, no.

590
03:10:02,140 --> 03:10:07,140
It only took me like 20 minutes to make everything transparent, but like so, yeah.

591
03:10:07,140 --> 03:10:11,140
Shout out to fucking Nari.

592
03:10:11,140 --> 03:10:16,140
Holy shit. Yeah, Nari's got it.

593
03:10:16,140 --> 03:10:32,140
Truly, I would love to learn how to rig or make model art a really cool and lucrative skill to have.

594
03:10:32,140 --> 03:10:52,140
Okay.

595
03:10:52,140 --> 03:10:58,140
Okay, just come down easy sweetheart.

596
03:10:58,140 --> 03:11:04,140
I know that was quite a ride.

597
03:11:04,140 --> 03:11:10,140
Are you okay? Do you need me to get you anything?

598
03:11:10,140 --> 03:11:16,140
Here, let me help you to the bathroom.

599
03:11:16,140 --> 03:11:21,140
Just sit down and I'll get you cleaned up, okay?

600
03:11:21,140 --> 03:11:29,140
Just sit down and I'll get you cleaned up, okay?

601
03:11:29,140 --> 03:11:53,140
Let me just run this nice, warm towel Oreo and wipe everything away from my darling.

602
03:11:53,140 --> 03:12:00,140
Pissing all about yourself, handsome.

603
03:12:00,140 --> 03:12:08,140
Oh, you're such a mess.

604
03:12:08,140 --> 03:12:14,140
Oh, I've utterly destroyed you. I'm so sorry.

605
03:12:14,140 --> 03:12:19,140
Oh, you would rather stand. I understand.

606
03:12:19,140 --> 03:12:26,140
It might be hard for you to sit.

607
03:12:26,140 --> 03:12:42,140
No shame in it.

608
03:12:42,140 --> 03:12:47,140
There, you're all clean.

609
03:12:47,140 --> 03:12:58,140
Did you want me to make you a bath instead?

610
03:12:58,140 --> 03:13:10,140
I don't mind running you a bath.

611
03:13:10,140 --> 03:13:14,140
You deserve it.

612
03:13:14,140 --> 03:13:19,140
It worked so hard to clean me.

613
03:13:19,140 --> 03:13:36,140
You did such a good job.

614
03:13:36,140 --> 03:13:40,140
I don't know how to make running water noises.

615
03:13:40,140 --> 03:14:02,140
I can't take my mic over to the sink.

616
03:14:02,140 --> 03:14:08,140
Hold on, let me put my 3DO back on the stand.

617
03:14:32,140 --> 03:14:57,140
I don't know.

618
03:14:57,140 --> 03:15:15,140
Oh, you weren't the good boy. You were the best boy.

619
03:15:15,140 --> 03:15:28,140
Just relax.

620
03:15:28,140 --> 03:15:52,140
I'm going to pour some water down your back.

621
03:15:52,140 --> 03:16:05,140
You have such beautiful hair.

622
03:16:05,140 --> 03:16:15,140
You know, you also smell so good.

623
03:16:15,140 --> 03:16:22,140
You smell like the aftermath of us.

624
03:16:22,140 --> 03:16:50,140
You smell like the way it smells.

625
03:16:50,140 --> 03:17:05,140
You don't even have enough water to tell you how wonderful you are.

626
03:17:20,140 --> 03:17:33,140
You brought me so much pleasure.

627
03:17:33,140 --> 03:17:43,140
You made me so happy.

628
03:17:43,140 --> 03:17:51,140
I love you so much.

629
03:17:51,140 --> 03:18:05,140
You always want what's best for me.

630
03:18:05,140 --> 03:18:27,140
So let me take care of you right now.

631
03:18:27,140 --> 03:18:52,140
Let me rinse your hair out my love.

632
03:18:52,140 --> 03:18:59,140
I'm sorry, I don't have that much.

633
03:18:59,140 --> 03:19:11,140
My supplement is just a little chat.

634
03:19:11,140 --> 03:19:19,140
I'm close to being under 3K.

635
03:19:19,140 --> 03:19:46,140
Hopefully after a week I know why I feel like we would have been past 5K by now.

636
03:19:46,140 --> 03:19:53,140
But anyways, let me focus on you. You're all that matters to me right now.

637
03:19:53,140 --> 03:20:04,140
I want to make sure that you feel safe and loved.

638
03:20:04,140 --> 03:20:14,140
I have to make sure that I don't break too much.

639
03:20:34,140 --> 03:20:51,140
You took it so well. You didn't break under the pressure. I'm so impressed with you.

640
03:20:51,140 --> 03:20:59,140
I think you deserve a present.

641
03:21:21,140 --> 03:21:43,140
You deserve the world, you know that right?

642
03:21:43,140 --> 03:22:12,140
I think that means you need to be reminded more often that you are loved, that you are worth it.

643
03:22:12,140 --> 03:22:21,140
That you're someone always there when you offer you love.

644
03:22:21,140 --> 03:22:32,140
And that's me, because you're mine. You don't ever stop being mine.

645
03:22:32,140 --> 03:22:45,140
You work so hard to please everybody, but you need to please yourself.

646
03:22:45,140 --> 03:23:00,140
I want you to do something for yourself, because you deserve it.

647
03:23:00,140 --> 03:23:17,140
You deserve happiness.

648
03:23:17,140 --> 03:23:29,140
And I know the part of you, the part of you, takes the pain because I think that you're worth it.

649
03:23:29,140 --> 03:23:38,140
You're loved. You mean so much to me.

650
03:23:38,140 --> 03:23:58,140
I never feel like you have to punish yourself, all I do for pleasure.

651
03:23:58,140 --> 03:24:05,140
Do you want me to tell you what I like about you?

652
03:24:05,140 --> 03:24:23,140
I might never stop talking if I do.

653
03:24:23,140 --> 03:24:29,140
I like how dedicated you are.

654
03:24:29,140 --> 03:24:35,140
I love how warm you are.

655
03:24:35,140 --> 03:24:47,140
You're so smart and intelligent and I can talk to you for hours.

656
03:24:47,140 --> 03:25:04,140
You're welcome for my talk act.

657
03:25:04,140 --> 03:25:17,140
I can't get my hands off of you.

658
03:25:17,140 --> 03:25:30,140
Yes, you are so obedient. Another, you know, desired trait.

659
03:25:30,140 --> 03:25:35,140
You need to cry then cry.

660
03:25:35,140 --> 03:25:44,140
Let it out. It's not good to keep those things locked inside you.

661
03:25:44,140 --> 03:25:54,140
Here, why don't you lay on my chest and just relax my thigh.

662
03:26:14,140 --> 03:26:37,140
It's okay. Let it out.

663
03:26:44,140 --> 03:27:06,140
Let it out.

664
03:27:06,140 --> 03:27:13,140
I hope you realize how tough you are.

665
03:27:13,140 --> 03:27:18,140
You can't do so much.

666
03:27:18,140 --> 03:27:28,140
No matter how many times the world tries to break you.

667
03:27:28,140 --> 03:27:31,140
You're still standing.

668
03:27:31,140 --> 03:27:49,140
You're not going to ever forget that.

669
03:27:49,140 --> 03:28:02,140
Do you want me to watch you?

670
03:28:02,140 --> 03:28:04,140
Do I have you?

671
03:28:04,140 --> 03:28:08,140
Yes, and I still have you.

672
03:28:08,140 --> 03:28:17,140
No matter how strong you are.

673
03:28:17,140 --> 03:28:26,140
Even though the world might seem harsh,

674
03:28:26,140 --> 03:28:38,140
you can still find your way.

675
03:28:38,140 --> 03:28:48,140
Always look like you're in somebody's happiness.

676
03:28:48,140 --> 03:28:57,140
You can go and do anything you want to.

677
03:28:57,140 --> 03:29:10,140
You can do anything you want to.

678
03:29:10,140 --> 03:29:18,140
You may not think it. You may not have the confidence.

679
03:29:18,140 --> 03:29:29,140
But that's the one thing I found out about that confidence in you.

680
03:29:29,140 --> 03:29:36,140
You have accomplished so much.

681
03:29:36,140 --> 03:29:45,140
What I want you to do when you go home after spending time with me.

682
03:29:45,140 --> 03:29:53,140
I want you to look at the mirror and look at yourself.

683
03:29:53,140 --> 03:30:03,140
I want you to do the right thing on five good things about you.

684
03:30:03,140 --> 03:30:14,140
I want you to do the right thing on five good things about you.

685
03:30:14,140 --> 03:30:29,140
I want you to do the right thing on five good things about you.

686
03:30:29,140 --> 03:30:31,140
You're welcome.

687
03:30:31,140 --> 03:30:36,140
I know what you're doing.

688
03:30:36,140 --> 03:30:39,140
I'm glad that you thought you'd do that.

689
03:30:39,140 --> 03:30:48,140
A lot of the things that bother us the most are like what you think you are.

690
03:30:48,140 --> 03:30:55,140
I wish you had been strong and you didn't do so well.

691
03:30:55,140 --> 03:31:03,140
You want me to come in five good things about you?

692
03:31:03,140 --> 03:31:07,140
Hard work there.

693
03:31:07,140 --> 03:31:12,140
You get up early morning and you take home the thing you might not want to be.

694
03:31:12,140 --> 03:31:18,140
Some people might be simple by getting out of bed is a hard part.

695
03:31:18,140 --> 03:31:23,140
You did it?

696
03:31:23,140 --> 03:31:28,140
You probably, you know, had a choice in it.

697
03:31:28,140 --> 03:31:31,140
You don't really do the time.

698
03:31:31,140 --> 03:31:35,140
You probably completed the time.

699
03:31:35,140 --> 03:31:39,140
You did the most simple as time and got through it.

700
03:31:39,140 --> 03:31:41,140
Just don't take care of it.

701
03:31:41,140 --> 03:31:53,140
You're also so very loving.

702
03:31:53,140 --> 03:31:56,140
This is stuff like that.

703
03:31:56,140 --> 03:32:05,140
I don't think I've experienced the type of love you've shown me before.

704
03:32:05,140 --> 03:32:10,140
So intense.

705
03:32:10,140 --> 03:32:22,140
So powerful.

706
03:32:22,140 --> 03:32:28,140
So much love to you.

707
03:32:28,140 --> 03:32:30,140
There's so much love to you.

708
03:32:30,140 --> 03:32:34,140
So why don't you give it to yourself?

709
03:32:34,140 --> 03:32:54,140
Shhh.

710
03:32:54,140 --> 03:32:57,140
That's so good.

711
03:32:57,140 --> 03:33:05,140
Just like that.

712
03:33:05,140 --> 03:33:22,140
Just like that.

713
03:33:22,140 --> 03:33:31,140
Just like that.

714
03:33:31,140 --> 03:33:35,140
Think about other things too.

715
03:33:35,140 --> 03:33:51,140
You don't know me at all.

716
03:33:51,140 --> 03:33:55,140
It's going to be my fault.

717
03:33:55,140 --> 03:33:58,140
Your safety.

718
03:33:58,140 --> 03:34:02,140
And my love.

719
03:34:02,140 --> 03:34:12,140
Even if it's just for tonight.

720
03:34:51,140 --> 03:35:17,140
Don't cry.

721
03:35:17,140 --> 03:35:19,140
Oh my sweet, don't cry.

722
03:35:19,140 --> 03:35:21,140
Oh my floating fucking head.

723
03:35:21,140 --> 03:35:23,140
Laugh, laugh at my floating head.

724
03:35:23,140 --> 03:35:25,140
Do it now.

725
03:35:25,140 --> 03:35:28,140
Laugh away.

726
03:35:28,140 --> 03:35:34,140
I want you to be happy.

727
03:35:34,140 --> 03:35:38,140
Wow.

728
03:35:38,140 --> 03:35:45,140
My child.

729
03:35:45,140 --> 03:35:47,140
Yeah, I can do aftercare too.

730
03:35:47,140 --> 03:35:49,140
I'll insult you.

731
03:35:49,140 --> 03:35:51,140
You won't take care of you.

732
03:35:51,140 --> 03:35:54,140
Oh, please don't.

733
03:35:54,140 --> 03:36:01,140
I'm a very empathetic person.

734
03:36:01,140 --> 03:36:06,140
So I get it.

735
03:36:06,140 --> 03:36:08,140
I can be soft dumb.

736
03:36:08,140 --> 03:36:10,140
I can be hard dumb.

737
03:36:10,140 --> 03:36:13,140
I can be a goofy dumb.

738
03:36:13,140 --> 03:36:20,140
Which is mostly what I am.

739
03:36:20,140 --> 03:36:23,140
Look at when I go to the side.

740
03:36:23,140 --> 03:36:25,140

741
03:36:25,140 --> 03:36:28,140

time and oh yeah what was there I did a voice for a Zura oh speaking of what so

881
03:53:57,680 --> 03:54:04,360
you know that clip from Emmys stream that she used of me like what about your cock

882
03:54:04,360 --> 03:54:12,200
like oh my god my voice is cracked because I've been doing a lot of voices so that

883
03:54:12,200 --> 03:54:22,720
was from I was testing my microphone for recordings I think for the game because

884
03:54:22,880 --> 03:54:28,520
I didn't use the we didn't use the 3D os to record the game lines and so I was

885
03:54:28,520 --> 03:54:33,160
just like fucking around and I was just like what about your cock yeah and I

886
03:54:33,160 --> 03:54:37,760
would like go high and like do so she cut specifically those lines and use

887
03:54:37,760 --> 03:54:43,240
because I would I would just say normal lines like oh we got to go fight these

888
03:54:43,240 --> 03:54:48,520
monsters blah blah blah blah blah and then and then but then I would like

889
03:54:48,560 --> 03:54:53,600
usually when I sent my line because I would send my lines to the group chat so

890
03:54:53,600 --> 03:54:57,040
they could like so I could be like oh what do you guys think and then I would

891
03:54:57,040 --> 03:55:02,280
usually throw in something funny at the end like for one of them oh my god I'll

892
03:55:02,280 --> 03:55:09,720
just play one for you hold on let me find it because a Zura was said I sounded

893
03:55:09,720 --> 03:55:18,800
like a lead character and so I recorded a league lead character lines for her

894
03:55:20,960 --> 03:55:29,960
there is it well me what are you doing oh yeah I saw she said I sounded like

895
03:55:29,960 --> 03:55:36,520
Timo so I recorded Timo lines for her and she was geeking out

896
03:55:36,840 --> 03:55:42,840
tell them I turn this off real brief like

897
03:55:45,720 --> 03:55:54,160
size doesn't mean everything never underestimate the power of the scouts

898
03:55:54,160 --> 03:56:00,920
code swiftly I didn't even know the voice that I can do sounds like Timo

899
03:56:00,920 --> 03:56:15,640
cuz I don't play league ow I just hit my arm so it was like really funny and I

900
03:56:15,640 --> 03:56:26,560
let me see if I can find the one I set let me find the one that I am that that

901
03:56:26,560 --> 03:56:38,480
came from let me see this one that's not it wait was it cuz yeah it was the it

902
03:56:38,480 --> 03:56:45,400
was also like the trailer lines that we were working on for the for the for the

903
03:56:45,400 --> 03:56:52,920
trailer that was a mutual no no it's not really

904
03:56:52,920 --> 03:57:03,680
peachy no I don't think that sounds really peachy at all that was almost my

905
03:57:03,680 --> 03:57:14,960
line for the trailer hard hard because the editor kept sending like for the

906
03:57:14,960 --> 03:57:22,520
video first like when they sent in the lines my mic would always peak for the

907
03:57:22,520 --> 03:57:26,880
work hard so that's why I didn't make it into the trailer cuz I'm like hard and

908
03:57:26,880 --> 03:57:31,680
it just sounded like shit but first but when I play it back it sounds normal so

909
03:57:31,680 --> 03:57:43,120
I'm like huh brother and they're editing that's fucking up my audio because I
