00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:28,080
Hi. Good morning. Good morning. Sorry that was boomy. How are you? I got up early.

2
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:37,160
What is happening? I went and I saw my mom and I got some coffee. So I have some

3
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:47,040
coffee. Well let's just try with a shot of espresso. But yeah. We got some coffee and

4
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:54,320
we're ready to rumble. All I can think about is the Elden Ring DLC. I didn't do

5
00:02:54,320 --> 00:03:04,960
much last night. To be honest, I didn't think I would beat Verlana yesterday. I

6
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:10,080
was just like oh let me just play a couple times before I go to bed. Blah blah blah.

7
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,400
And then fall asleep to some Elden Ring lore videos as one does. And then I beat her

8
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:26,880
in three tries and I'm like well I wish I caught this on stream. But okay. I didn't believe in myself

9
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:34,640
and I guess me not believing in myself and being comfy on my couch helped a lot. It was very nice

10
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:41,840
gaming from my couch because my couch is a lot comfier than my chair. Where did my cord go?

11
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:51,440
But I didn't really do anything other than beat her. As you guys saw it took me like 30 minutes

12
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:59,280
or maybe like an hour. And if you look at the timestamps on my tweets on my all account.

13
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:07,840
Then I went to go get some like farm some armor. So I got the which armor set did I get? I forget.

14
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,440
But then I realized Verlana's armor is better. So I was like never mind. Why did I just do this?

15
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:18,720
And then I was thinking okay do I need to do anything else before I go to

16
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,720
what's it called? Before I go to the Shadowkeep and trigger the NPC event.

17
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,880
And from what I gathered there's like one guy I might need to talk to. And the name is like

18
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:42,640
more something. I don't know if it's worth it. So I was going to ask you guys if it's worth it to go

19
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:47,600
like do that quest to get all those cookbooks. But I'm like I don't really know if I need the

20
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:55,680
foragers cookbooks. Are they like necessary? As your impactive blades got bleed a roof like five

21
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:02,160
hits nice. Bring my couch over. I could turn my couch around. I'm not even joking actually.

22
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,640
I'm not going to do that though. I would take a lot of strength and effort and I'm I'm too weak.

23
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,120
I'm not too weak but it would just cause me pain in the long run.

24
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,080
Let me hop over here.

25
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:32,800
Come on down. And um let me oh it's already connected. Perfect.

26
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,480
That's my cat. That's Boomi. He's having the time of his life.

27
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:49,680
Where's the chat? I just totally got rid of you guys. Not necessary. Okay I thought it wasn't

28
00:05:49,680 --> 00:06:01,520
necessary. So yeah um I won't be like one speaky today. My voice isn't squeaky or high so sometimes

29
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:09,680
I just wake up like that. I don't want to tell you. Let's check it. There's some really weird

30
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:15,040
audio noise in the background. Oh hold on I think I know what that is. I accidentally unplugged my

31
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:30,560
go XLR so it probably is not behaving. Hold on let me restart.

32
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,560
Does that sound a little bit better?

33
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,400
Manelio?

34
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:58,640
Is it much better? Okay cool. Yeah so I accidentally kicked my thing before I started and I just

35
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,160
plugged it back in. I was like oh that'll be fine. No I forget I always have to restart the

36
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,720
go XLR app. But good morning. Hi. Let me tweet that I am live.

37
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:18,400
Hi. I'm playing the DLC again and I accidentally

38
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:34,800
be Renala off stream. I guess I don't know my own skills with a Z.

39
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,720
And then let's do an arm flex emoji.

40
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:53,680
That's a mechanical arm. Um flex. If I search flex I don't want to dig through the emoji list.

41
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:00,080
Okay and then we'll do a little blowing smoke from the nose face.

42
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:17,040
And then I'll add my lovely thumbnail that took me five minutes to do. Do you like how I just copied

43
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:23,920
the PNG from the wiki for Elden Ring for this the star sword thingy? That's all I did.

44
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:33,120
Um again I didn't really have a lot to do this morning so I'm like I just want to play Elden

45
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,640
Ring man. I don't know what to tell you. I just want to play Elden Ring all the time. It does look

46
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:46,240
like a wand. It does look like a wand. You're not wrong. Um didn't see the thumbnail. I don't know

47
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:53,440
whatever. That's fine. The thumbnail is not that crazy. Um somebody claimed the last video

48
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,600
which I thought was dumb. They claimed it for the Elden Ring music and I'm like come on bro.

49
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,880
And then they claimed um what else did they claim? They claimed another video of mine.

50
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:13,040
I'm like I'm gonna fight you bro. Hello hi. Can you keep writing over the thumbnail every time

51
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,800
yeah actually I'm thinking I'll do that. That's why I just added on to it. I might just change

52
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:25,840
the weapon if I change weapons. Um but I didn't get far. I literally just beat Rolanna and then

53
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:34,800
I got her and then I got another set of armor and then I was I was gonna play and do that guys

54
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:41,440
um quest line but then I saw how depressing it was and I decided I didn't really want to talk to

55
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:48,880
him at all. Um and then I wanted to ask you guys if it's worth it to do Moore's quest line for his

56
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:58,720
cookbooks um it's not claimable. They just they just do the the elder ever building gorilla thumbnail

57
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:08,320
yep. Um so literally we're just gonna go to the Shadowkeep and hope for the best. Um yeah I spoiled

58
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:18,720
like his end game uh dialogue for myself and I was like oh that's depressing. Damn son um I got my chai

59
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,760
oh let's get ready to rumble. Hold on I'm even trokus first I can't think my mom's next to me.

60
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:58,880
What are you doing for me? I don't know what my my son is doing. He's been he like I like came home

61
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:04,960
from seeing my mom and I was like hi for me and he was like like all happy and stuff and I went to pet

62
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:12,480
him and he just bit me and I'm like come on and now he's just spazzing out behind me so I think he

63
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:20,160
just wants to play um and then Reina's just watching him she's just sitting and staring at him freak

64
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:26,320
out in his little tunnel that you can hear it's crinkling in the background. No but it's true I

65
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:34,080
literally go and he like I went to pet him he was like roll him around all happy and I pet him on

69
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:05,840

122
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:54,160
have a really long hair I don't know why they do that because like it's not part of her helmet

128
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:40,560

129
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:50,160
my strength is at 12 I kind of want to bump it up to 13 just so I can use these at some point

130
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,560
if I two hands

131

190
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,400

191
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:23,040
and i regretted it afterwards because they kept making uh grape juice jokes and inappropriate

200
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:20,560
want to hang out with them and then i saw that there were other people in it and i was like no

201
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:29,680
and then i saw clips from what had happened and i was like this is what i mean like why would

202
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:36,880
you put yourself in that position because people are going to one like fan bases are gonna freak out

203
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:46,960
two some vtuber male vtubers know that the type of like if you're like a gfe vtuber whatever

204
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:54,960
you they're going to push your buttons and do shit on purpose yeah male is a race um

205
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:03,840
let's say let's say i was let's say i was in there and i was put in the same position

206
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:09,440
with the people that you guys all know what i'm fucking talking about i would have broken

207
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,960
characters so quick and i would have told them to shut the fuck up and do not fucking fuck with me

208
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:25,440
bro or i will end you i'm like i the disrespect from some of the people in that server and in the

209
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,240
in the in the words of roleplay you guys can't see i'm doing air quotes i'm sorry i'm raging right

210
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,240
now it pissed me the fuck off it pissed me the fuck off so bad

211
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:42,560
like i was i was like you literally just said this to her excuse me excuse you

212
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:50,640
what are you daft bro are you fucking daft are you did you what you dropped on the head as a child

213
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:58,160
um honestly i hope that somebody makes an all-female one because i would be in on that so

214
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:03,360
bad you guys know i love to improv and i love to roleplay uh i'm gonna go off because i was just

215
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,840
like i'm just personally mad that people were put into a situation that they shouldn't have been

216
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:12,560
put in and they're honestly i know those people who like the person the vtuber who was targeted was a

217
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:21,520
sweet person and now like i just feel bad for everybody in that server like i just i know and

218
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:26,800
i know that wasn't the server owner's intention at all

219
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:35,440
like i know they wanted a nice environment but so there's always someone that has to ruin it

220
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:41,120
you know and sometimes i'm happy

221
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:50,400
that we don't get invited to things because everybody thinks we're whores because we are

222
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:59,680
affectionate but they think we're like doing stuff on like fansly with men and i'm like

223
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:07,360
there's only my cat here he's a boy no that's disgusting nobody else is in my house um

224
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:18,800
but no don't bother looking it up i'm just i just saw it this morning when i was like

225
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:22,880
roman on twitter and i just got really pissed like i'm sorry like i'm going off right now

226
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,760
i'll probably cut this from the vod because i don't but i was i was honestly so fucking pissed off

227
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:35,680
like i was yeah no shame don't cause awesome content i was generally livid

228
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:43,440
and i have not gotten like that mad in a while watching that

229
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:53,040
like i have never like that i don't like like this is like it's just like that person

230
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:59,040
should apologize to them because you could you shouldn't you shouldn't um

231
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,480
like frame it and like oh it's role play no like you can be a respectful role player

232
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,360
i've never even done gta role play but i'm like that people like and i know probably some servers

233
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:21,600
are toxic like that but like come on you know um and mind you i also just feel bad for that vtuber

234
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:27,120
because i think like of course you have a brand and when you don't when you do something that's

235
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:31,840
like doesn't align with that brand but you like you're sacrificing the happiness of your fan base

236
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:40,320
for your own happiness it's a it's a fine line um and i know that that person probably just wanted

237
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:44,880
to stream and just have fun and play with their friends and then people have to ruin it for other

238
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:53,040
people so i honestly don't really blame that vtuber at all for just wanting to hang out uh or the

239
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:58,000
people that are normally labeled as like gfee to be in that server because they probably just

240
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,920
wanted to stay amongst themselves and just hang out and then people have to come and ruin it and

241
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:07,760
that just sucks so honestly i hope i hope someone out there makes a female only one i'm just saying

242
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:15,360
because like sometimes it can just be really toxic um and or as you can see that like the

243
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:20,960
minecraft server was a success the mario kart tournament was a success do you know what the

244
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:29,840
commonality of that was huh oh no males and don't get me wrong not all male vtubers are like that

245
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:36,080
like they're not like uh there are some that are actually entertaining and i don't watch them but

246
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:42,960
i know that there's some out there that are actually entertaining um and that are probably

247
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:47,040
good at what they do and they're just like you know one of the boys and respectful in a bro

248
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:55,200
that's great um but there's people who just take stuff too far and push buttons and it's just rude

249
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:01,840
i think that was very disrespectful i'm so i don't mean to go off but like i like

250
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:05,360
it yeah it's just i'm sorry i'm sorry

251
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:13,600
because like i want to role play so bad that'd be so fun like that's why i before i even saw

252
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:19,440
who was in there i was like can we please do this can we please and then my manager just

253
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,520
was like actually this is house this is who was also in there and i'm like yo ain't never mind

254
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,240
sorry jk no thank you

255
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:38,160
yeah like i've watched um uh uo to owo uo uo labs is the thing they rebranded yeah

256
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:44,400
and they helped me out in my pl they would they they rated me um during one of my uh

257
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:49,520
during my birthday donathon as my my pl and they're they they're interesting they actually

258
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:55,440
have interesting content i like watching people blow shit up that's fun the five nights at freddy

259
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:04,240
thing they just did that's cool the other shit that other people do not cool not cool and that's

260
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:11,840
why i like nova so much because she's like the female version of him um my chat's frozen again

261
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:18,640
what is new what's new there nothing's new oops i accidentally closed the game don't worry about

262
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:29,840
it um let me refresh it let's see if that fixes it um mind you i'm not like i'm very aware of

263
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:33,440
my fan base and what they want and they don't want so like you guys don't have to worry about that for

264
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:43,360
me um yeah nova yeah nova e she's she's chill she's cool she she made she rigged me spitting

265
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:47,520
on my spitting on her audience and that was pretty awesome it was pretty awesome and that's

266
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,040
when like when i first came out and she did that and i was like oh my god you're so cool for that

267
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:55,680
thank you i'm a very appreciative of of v4 mariah because they they actually like hang out with us

268
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:02,720
and like us otherwise everybody else is just like east degenerates and i'm like that's fine

269
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:07,760
you're entitled to but that's type of content we make i don't blame you at all um if people are

270
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,040
uncomfortable with it i'm not gonna force them to like me force them to hang out with me you know

271
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,040
like why the fuck would i do that uh i've come to terms with that before i was just like oh i need

272
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:20,080
everyone to like me how am i no it's not like they don't like me they just don't like what i

273
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:27,120
do and just like my view of male vtubers they're fine i just don't like what they do

274
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:35,520
no it's like there's nothing wrong with being a prude like there's nothing like if your brand is

275
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:42,880
being say so obviously you're not going to want to interact with a non-say so vtuber that's totally

276
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:52,880
acceptable in my opinion um carol terpheria um you know we just started it's only like

hello

317
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,680
somewhere a great rune has broken

318
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,280
and so too has a powerful charm

319
00:42:53,680 --> 00:43:00,960
i don't quite understand that because i know you just you break michela's

320
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,720
charm over people um

321
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:19,520
and i don't get why approaching the shadow keep does that to be honest with you i can't see shit

322
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,080
you

323
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:38,400
michela's discarded oh okay so when he discards his rune because he's shedding his his body to be cut

324
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,360
to attain godhood

325
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,320
to clint i still don't know america sin was but go off this um

326
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:51,220
um

327
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,120
all right so apparently we got a boss fight in here

328
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:04,160
yeah you're following michela in real time and dlc's moving around as you are that's pretty neat

329
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:12,640
actually like you progress time and like again elton ring is so unique and i love it so much

330
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:22,160
because of how they integrate gameplay mechanics into the actual lore like this is literally a whole

331
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:29,680
game about why you keep coming back to life after you die as a player in a game like that's

332
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:34,880
doubt like when i realized that when the first came out that honestly boggled my mind and i'm

333
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:41,760
like why hasn't anybody really done that before would be cool if i knew the lore well let me

334
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:50,160
tell you there are 3 13 hour 12 hour videos by smoke town that you can watch i haven't watched

335
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:59,440
those yet because i i just i can't lock in um i know dark souls one has like a the same thing

336
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:05,280
because i all from soft games like work oh come on i should have um

337
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:11,680
scratching my nose

338
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:19,520
hey can you like give me a second actually let me die by the beginning in front of the room so

01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:35,560
I don't understand why.

624
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:40,560
What if I do this?

625
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:43,560
Ooh, comfy.

626
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:44,560
All right.

627
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:51,560
Okay, what if I put this behind me?

628
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:55,560
I knocked over my plant.

629
01:23:55,560 --> 01:24:04,560
But I fixed it so it's fine.

630
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:07,560
Yeah, he's like, he like licked her fur in the wrong direction.

631
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:09,560
She's this wet spot on her.

632
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:11,560
I might have to brush her.

633
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:12,560
It's kind of funny looking.

634
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:18,560
She has like a cowlick except it's a boomy lick.

635
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:21,560
Let's put a flame resist talisman.

636
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:24,560
What is he, what is Mesmer weak to?

637
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:44,560
Cause I have the flame drake talisman three so I should be fine.

638
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:46,560
He's weak to fire.

639
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:49,560
Yeah.

640
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:57,560
He's weak to slash and frostbite.

641
01:24:57,560 --> 01:25:09,560
I'm not really using sorceries right now so I might do that.

642
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:13,560
I don't need magic negation.

643
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:31,560
Oh, I got the blessed do talisman so I might grab that.

644
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:46,560
I don't even know what to say to you anymore.

645
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:49,560
I don't think I, do I have anything that does slash?

646
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:53,560
Okay, so my backhand blade might actually be helpful.

647
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:59,560
I can, I don't have a frost ass of war.

648
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:19,560
You said I need a magic wet blade for that, don't I?

649
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:27,560
I don't know why I don't have the magic wet blade.

650
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:36,560
Oh, I never grabbed it.

651
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:40,560
Sorry, I'm watching where that is.

652
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:43,560
Cause I went in that room, I just never fucking grabbed it.

653
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:55,560
Oh my god, I'm so dumb.

654
01:26:55,560 --> 01:27:01,560
I've been, I like, I've been told that it seems like Mesmer gets weak in his second face.

655
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:10,560
That's why I kind of want to beat him as soon as possible before they fucking patch that.

656
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:24,560
Let's quickly go to the debate parlor in Ryokaria and go get that.

657
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:31,560
Wait, no, it's not in the debate parlor.

658
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:34,560
I think it's for lore reasons.

659
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:36,560
Is it over here?

660
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:46,560
Oh yeah, it is actually.

661
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:48,560
My eye is fucking twitching hardcore.

662
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:51,560
I don't know why my eye has been twitching lately.

663
01:27:51,560 --> 01:28:01,560
It's my right eye.

664
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:12,560
I don't know why I never grabbed this.

665
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:17,560
Can you de-aggro me please?

666
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:20,560
How are they still aggroing me?

667
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:27,560
I'm literally.

668
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:31,560
The fact that I didn't kill you in one hit is actually kind of weird.

669
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:36,560
Oh yeah, I forgot there's a fucking maiden over here.

670
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:38,560
Awkward.

671
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:46,560
Oh wait, you're re-delighting.

672
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:48,560
Bitch.

673
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:53,560
Wow, if only I had this when I was fucking doing the duo.

674
01:28:53,560 --> 01:29:09,560
Jesus Christ.

675
01:29:09,560 --> 01:29:11,560
Time for crab.

676
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:12,560
I want crab legs.

677
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:16,560
Oh my god, crab legs would fucking slap.

678
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:17,560
Fuck up some crab legs.

679
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:18,560
Sorry.

680
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:24,560
This is just the poppins of my head.

681
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:32,560
I don't even know where I would get crab legs.

682
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:35,560
Hola!

683
01:29:35,560 --> 01:29:38,560
Wait, can I raise my spear dash?

684
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:41,560
No, I don't have a ghost glove, Ward 6.

685
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:43,560
Hey.

686
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:44,560
Why do you?

687
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:47,560
I wish they would vary his thing.

688
01:29:47,560 --> 01:29:49,560
Be like, oh, where you been?

689
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:51,560
What are you buying?

690
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:55,560
What are you selling?

691
01:29:55,560 --> 01:30:02,560
I wish I had two backhand blades.

692
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:05,560
Actually, hold on.

693
01:30:05,560 --> 01:30:11,560
Let's take a moment.

694
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:23,560
Slash Pierce.

695
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:27,560
I wish I had more faith.

696
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:29,560
Actually, no, he has...

697
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:38,560
I know that won't help his fire.

698
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:48,560
I don't have enough strength because then I would just throw it on the Nagakiva.

699
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:53,560
Dragon Hunter's Great Katana has Slash Pierce.

700
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:55,560
But I don't think I can...

701
01:30:55,560 --> 01:31:06,560
I can't put an actual war on that.

702
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:07,560
I don't have enough faith.

703
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:15,560
I love the sides.

704
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:16,560
Hello.

705
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:19,560
I find your lack of faith disturbing.

706
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:29,560
No, I don't feel like respecking.

707
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:34,560
Never talked to Gideon.

708
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:41,560
I did briefly and I destroyed his entire room.

709
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:45,560
Hi, hi. Good morning.

710
01:31:45,560 --> 01:31:48,560
Time.

711
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:50,560
Do you hear Boomi in the background?

712
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:54,560
He's just skating across my hardwood floor.

713
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:59,560
I don't know what he's doing.

714
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:06,560
I keep scrabbling in the background.

715
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:14,560
We just killed the hippo and I'm debating...

716
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:15,560
Well, I have...

717
01:32:15,560 --> 01:32:17,560
I can just throw Frostbite on here.

718
01:32:17,560 --> 01:32:19,560
I just like having these as lightning just because...

719
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:25,560
I like usually to have one weapon of every type that I can switch between.

720
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:31,560
That's what I did on my first playthrough for the open base game.

721
01:32:31,560 --> 01:32:38,560
But I think I might just...

722
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:39,560
Frostbite...

723
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:44,560
No, I still haven't been to Bonnie Village.

724
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:45,560
Cotton Booms?

725
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:50,560
Why wouldn't it be Cotton Bombs?

726
01:32:50,560 --> 01:33:04,560
It was right there and you totally missed that, brother.

727
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:07,560
I'm just thinking...

728
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:09,560
Don't I need more faith for Perfume Bottle?

729
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:14,560
I don't feel like respecking right now.

730
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:29,560
But I actually really want to use the Perfume Bottle because it's just a weird thing.

731
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:32,560
Because Bonnie Village is literally right here.

732
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:37,560
I just haven't gone or I've been...

733
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:39,560
No, I haven't been.

734
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:41,560
I came through...

735
01:33:41,560 --> 01:33:43,560
Did I go down there?

736
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:51,560
Now I kind of feel like doing some more exploration before I move forward in the Shadowkeep.

737
01:33:51,560 --> 01:33:55,560
I'll be honest with you.

738
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:57,560
The Frostbite has no faith.

739
01:33:57,560 --> 01:33:58,560
It's intelligent.

740
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:02,560
Oh, let's go get it, boys.

741
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:04,560
I know Bonnie Village is over here.

742
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:08,560
I don't have any sites of grace.

743
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:09,560
Wait...

744
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:11,560
Is there a...

745
01:34:11,560 --> 01:34:13,560
Is there a ring?

746
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:14,560
Not a ring.

747
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:18,560
Is there a spring thing?

748
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:19,560
No, that's right.

749
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:20,560
I had to run up.

750
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:23,560
There wasn't any spring thing.

751
01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:25,560
But I can still probably go up this way, right?

752
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:28,560
And then go down.

753
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:33,560
He's moaning in the background.

754
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:36,560
There's a hole in the ground.

755
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:37,560
Let's do it.

756
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:38,560
Oh, I didn't mean to do that.

757
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:40,560
Let's do it.

758
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:42,560
Go get it.

759
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:44,560
I don't know where the Perfumer Talisman is.

760
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:45,560
Where is it?

761
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:46,560
Tell me.

762
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:51,560
I'll grab that, too.

763
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:54,560
If you're just coming in, my Tamagotchi died.

764
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:57,560
Poggers.

765
01:34:57,560 --> 01:34:59,560
You said where?

766
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:00,560
Base game.

767
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:01,560
Is it a perfume bottle?

768
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:03,560
Is that consecrated snow fields?

769
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:08,560
Because I didn't even lock them on top of the Giants.

770
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:09,560
I didn't...

771
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:11,560
I feel like it's over there.

772
01:35:11,560 --> 01:35:13,560
I know there's a lot of ice magic over there,

773
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:17,560
and I did not get any of it.

774
01:35:17,560 --> 01:35:18,560
Okay.

775
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:19,560
Into the Perfumer Ruins.

776
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:22,560
Okay.

777
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:23,560
Again.

778
01:35:23,560 --> 01:35:27,560
Yes, again.

779
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:31,560
There I go.

780
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:37,560
You can see how I didn't even bother with this area.

781
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:41,560
Where are the Perfumer Ruins?

782
01:35:41,560 --> 01:35:43,560
No.

783
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:45,560
No.

784
01:35:45,560 --> 01:35:47,560
Did I go there?

785
01:35:47,560 --> 01:35:49,560
Where are the Perfumer Ruins?

786
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:53,560
I forget.

787
01:35:53,560 --> 01:35:54,560
It's over here.

788
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:56,560
No, that's the Windum Ruins.

789
01:35:56,560 --> 01:36:00,560
It's over there.

790
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:10,560
It was pretty ugly.

791
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:15,560
It's probably like an 8 out of 10 ugly.

792
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:16,560
Left of that little lake.

793
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:19,560
Top?

794
01:36:19,560 --> 01:36:23,560
Left of this little lake?

795
01:36:23,560 --> 01:36:25,560
This one?

796
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:29,560
So it's over here?

797
01:36:29,560 --> 01:36:31,560
Yes.

798
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:33,560
Alright, let's do it, boys.

799
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:39,560
How the hell do I get over there is the question.

800
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:45,560
Because again, I didn't unlock all the sites of Grace.

801
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:58,560
Oh wait, I can just go down.

802
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:05,560
I never use a perfume bottle, so I'm kind of excited.

803
01:37:05,560 --> 01:37:13,560
So I can know what direction I'm going in.

804
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:15,560
Be careful of dragon.

805
01:37:15,560 --> 01:37:17,560
Dragon, these balls.

806
01:37:17,560 --> 01:37:22,560
Death.

807
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:25,560
How about I be careful of myself?

808
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:26,560
I need some juice.

809
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:30,560
I'm kind of thirsty.

810
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:36,560
Let's get the Talisman and then I'll...

811
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:38,560
I'm so sorry.

812
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:50,560
I just like to go off the beaten path.

813
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:52,560
Wait, are my ruins going to be up there?

814
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:54,560
Come here, bro.

815
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:56,560
The wolf is just looking at me.

816
01:37:56,560 --> 01:37:59,560
They're just sitting there like, hey, what's going on?

817
01:37:59,560 --> 01:38:04,560
Let me grab them.

818
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:12,560
I know it's only like not even 20k, but...

819
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:19,560
Don't mess with me, puppies.

820
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:22,560
There's a lot of golems.

821
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:24,560
Okay, so we did it that way.

822
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:27,560
And then we keep going down.

823
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:30,560
And then over there.

824
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:38,560
Go one.

825
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:44,560
That's right, I never fought land sacks over here.

826
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:50,560
You think she's weak against lightning?

827
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:54,560
Who was that?

828
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:56,560
Yippee.

829
01:38:56,560 --> 01:38:58,560
I think so, five.

830
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:10,560
Let's grab this one here.

831
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:12,560
Where is she?

832
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:14,560
I don't even fucking see land sacks.

833
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:16,560
She's just fucking gone.

834
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:19,560
She's teleported away.

835
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:22,560
Boo, land sacks.

836
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:25,560
What's this ash for, I forget.

837
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:31,560
No, you bitch.

838
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:33,560
Sacred order?

839
01:39:33,560 --> 01:39:40,560
I don't really hear about that.

840
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:48,560
There we are.

841
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:50,560
Okay, I'm just going to run around.

842
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:52,560
You guys got anything?

843
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:54,560
Oh fuck, I forgot you were here.

844
01:39:54,560 --> 01:39:57,560
Can I pick this up?

845
01:39:57,560 --> 01:39:59,560
No, these are just perfume bottles.

846
01:39:59,560 --> 01:40:02,560
At least you guys aren't that damaging to me.

847
01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:06,560
Remember last time that happened, I just fucking got got.

848
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:09,560
All right, where are you, Talisman?

849
01:40:09,560 --> 01:40:15,560
Where is the entrance to the hole?

850
01:40:15,560 --> 01:40:18,560
I like how there's a bunch of perfumers here.

851
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:22,560
Can I, can I please like, come on.

852
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:26,560
Ow, let me breathe.

853
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:35,560
Oh, that's, I don't, I think he's, oh my god.

854
01:40:35,560 --> 01:40:42,560
I'm getting fire and shit all over me, there it is.

855
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:44,560
Torrent help.

856
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:49,560
Yep.

857
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:54,560
No, these are just perfume bottles, where is it?

858
01:40:54,560 --> 01:41:00,560
I'm getting poisoned.

859
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:02,560
It's all take a moment.

860
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:05,560
It's under the floorboards, okay.

861
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:11,560
Sorry, there's poison fucking everywhere.

862
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:14,560
There we go.

863
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:20,560
Oh, Jesus.

864
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:27,560
I'm busy, don't hurt me.

865
01:41:27,560 --> 01:41:30,560
Perfect, there we go.

866
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:35,560
I just teleport out of here.

867
01:41:35,560 --> 01:41:39,560
Where are we going?

868
01:41:39,560 --> 01:41:48,560
We are going to Bonnie Village.

869
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:53,560
What is the best way to get there?

870
01:41:53,560 --> 01:41:58,560
You said there is a hole in the ground.

871
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:01,560
Oops, all poison.

872
01:42:01,560 --> 01:42:06,560
Jackie Chan, I don't know who Shen Gong Wu is, I'm sorry.

873
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:09,560
I have another time at work.

874
01:42:09,560 --> 01:42:11,560
Perfume Talisman in existence.

875
01:42:11,560 --> 01:42:14,560
Yeah, because I was literally like, what the fuck are perfume?

876
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:16,560
I remember, I was like, what is the point of this?

877
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:18,560
I'm never going to use it.

878
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:20,560
Looky here, now I'm going to use it.

879
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:25,560
Now I'm going to use it real good.

880
01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:31,560
Direct me.

881
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:35,560
I look sexy as hell.

882
01:42:35,560 --> 01:42:36,560
I'll wait.

883
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:43,560
I'm going to get some juice while you guys tell me which direction to go in.

884
01:43:05,560 --> 01:43:27,560
Follow the building is the hole in the center of the town.

885
01:43:27,560 --> 01:43:29,560
The hole in one of the buildings.

886
01:43:29,560 --> 01:43:30,560
What buildings?

887
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:34,560
Like the, hold on, let me turn.

888
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:37,560
Are these buildings?

889
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:41,560
These ones.

890
01:43:41,560 --> 01:43:43,560
I got my honest kid's juice box here.

891
01:43:43,560 --> 01:43:45,560
My strawberry peachy keen.

892
01:43:45,560 --> 01:43:48,560
Great flavor.

893
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:51,560
Hello.

894
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:52,560
Follow the path.

895
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:58,560
All right, queen.

896
01:43:58,560 --> 01:44:09,560
Yeah, the only back seating I allow is directions when it comes to when it comes to fucking course.

897
01:44:09,560 --> 01:44:13,560
I like juice boxes and go go squeeze is awesome.

898
01:44:13,560 --> 01:44:18,560
You guys don't, you guys don't know how to zoom or I really am.

899
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:27,560
I got to keep that haggler, you know, you can't all be zoomers and dealer.

900
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:33,560
Puppy.

901
01:44:33,560 --> 01:44:36,560
Can't lock on puppy.

902
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:37,560
Puppy.

903
01:44:37,560 --> 01:44:39,560
Puppy close to death.

904
01:44:39,560 --> 01:44:41,560
Man close to death.

905
01:44:41,560 --> 01:44:43,560
Can you stop digging?

906
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:45,560
Why are you so powerful?

907
01:44:45,560 --> 01:44:49,560
He's got one shot of a guy with just living his life.

908
01:44:49,560 --> 01:44:51,560
All right.

909
01:44:51,560 --> 01:44:53,560
Follow the path.

910
01:44:53,560 --> 01:45:01,560
There's not really a path per se.

911
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:04,560
Do you guys throw rock at me?

912
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:09,560
Oh, hole in the ground, hole in the ground.

913
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:15,560
Looking like a fool with a hole in the ground.

914
01:45:15,560 --> 01:45:21,560
I found the hole in the ground.

915
01:45:21,560 --> 01:45:33,560
Who are you?

916
01:45:33,560 --> 01:45:38,560
How do I get down there?

917
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:44,560
I'm not going to use torrent because I'm probably going to beat my ass if I use torrent or bust my ass rather.

918
01:45:44,560 --> 01:45:48,560
Why am I so powerful?

919
01:45:48,560 --> 01:45:51,560
Yeah, you think we wouldn't have fucking...

920
01:45:51,560 --> 01:45:53,560
We invented Capri Sun.

921
01:45:53,560 --> 01:46:00,560
All right, Capri Sun is an American thing.

922
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:02,560
What is this?

923
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:07,560
This is Stratatone Stone Tellsman 4.

924
01:46:07,560 --> 01:46:13,560
Oh, fascinating.

925
01:46:13,560 --> 01:46:17,560
Who is crying so loud?

926
01:46:17,560 --> 01:46:24,560
Let me put you out of your misery.

927
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:26,560
There must be somebody up there.

928
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:28,560
I just missed.

929
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:37,560
I can't really see.

930
01:46:37,560 --> 01:46:47,560
I might have to use torrent.

931
01:46:47,560 --> 01:46:48,560
I hate Kool-Aid.

932
01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:52,560
Kool-Aid tastes gross.

933
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:53,560
But, Shibi, you're brown now.

934
01:46:53,560 --> 01:46:54,560
Kool-Aid tastes fucking gross.

935
01:46:54,560 --> 01:47:02,560
Okay.

936
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:04,560
I also...

937
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:08,560
Yeah, it just tastes disgusting to me.

938
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:09,560
Nobody was going to say it.

939
01:47:09,560 --> 01:47:10,560
Yeah, but you're thinking it.

940
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:13,560
I just say what you guys are thinking out loud.

941
01:47:13,560 --> 01:47:26,560
That's all I do.

942
01:47:26,560 --> 01:47:28,560
I know what you guys think.

943
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:29,560
That's why I'm like...

944
01:47:29,560 --> 01:47:30,560
You're like, Shibi, nobody even said that.

945
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:32,560
I'm like, yeah, but you're thinking it.

946
01:47:32,560 --> 01:47:33,560
You know?

947
01:47:33,560 --> 01:47:35,560
It was actually in the middle of typing it.

948
01:47:35,560 --> 01:47:37,560
Yeah, whatever.

949
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:38,560
Kool's brown.

950
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:39,560
He was probably going to be like,

951
01:47:39,560 --> 01:47:40,560
what are people?

952
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:48,560
It's our people's drink.

953
01:47:48,560 --> 01:47:49,560
Capri Sun for bottles.

954
01:47:49,560 --> 01:47:52,560
That's disgusting.

955
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:54,560
Shibi, stop trying to meet the hair.

956
01:47:54,560 --> 01:47:55,560
What?

957
01:47:55,560 --> 01:47:56,560
You're the racist.

958
01:47:56,560 --> 01:47:57,560
You guys are all racist.

959
01:47:57,560 --> 01:47:58,560
I have a racist fan base.

960
01:47:58,560 --> 01:48:06,560
It's kind of disappointing.

961
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:07,560
Who is crying?

962
01:48:07,560 --> 01:48:16,560
I want to kill you.

963
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:18,560
Too loud.

964
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:24,560
Make it stop.

965
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:31,560
Rada rada.

966
01:48:31,560 --> 01:48:34,560
But you're one of the...

967
01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:38,560
You're one of the good ones.

968
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:50,560
I hate you.

969
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:56,560
Do you feel better now as she falls to the ground?

970
01:48:56,560 --> 01:49:01,560
Well, I tell you my friend.

971
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:05,560
Oh, no, guys, stop.

972
01:49:05,560 --> 01:49:06,560
No, we...

973
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:08,560
Oh, my God.

974
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:11,560
They literally...

975
01:49:11,560 --> 01:49:12,560
Everybody...

976
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:13,560
You guys are going to make people hate me

977
01:49:13,560 --> 01:49:15,560
even more than they already do.

978
01:49:15,560 --> 01:49:17,560
Shibi's fan base is racist.

979
01:49:17,560 --> 01:49:27,560
They all admitted it on a stream.

980
01:49:27,560 --> 01:49:33,560
Torrent, what the fuck are you doing?

981
01:49:33,560 --> 01:49:39,560
I don't know how you're supposed to jump down here, genuinely.

982
01:49:39,560 --> 01:49:43,560
I can't really see a lot of...

983
01:49:43,560 --> 01:49:46,560
I'm going to fall and die from here.

984
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:50,560
Yeah, like, I don't...

985
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:51,560
This is fucking stupid.

986
01:49:51,560 --> 01:49:55,560
I don't see how to jump down.

987
01:49:55,560 --> 01:49:57,560
Shibi, you call this racist?

988
01:49:57,560 --> 01:49:58,560
Because you guys are.

989
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:05,560
That doesn't mean I am.

990
01:50:05,560 --> 01:50:09,560
The V-Tweeters will find a way to hate everything regardless.

991
01:50:09,560 --> 01:50:11,560
You're not wrong.

992
01:50:11,560 --> 01:50:13,560
Honestly, if you don't stream, I don't care about your opinion.

993
01:50:13,560 --> 01:50:16,560
I'm kidding.

994
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:20,560
I'm feeling edgy this stream.

995
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:22,560
I'm feeling edgy.

996
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:25,560
I'm feeling disgruntled.

997
01:50:25,560 --> 01:50:29,560
I'm feeling...

998
01:50:29,560 --> 01:50:32,560
I'm feeling like causing problems.

999
01:50:32,560 --> 01:50:34,560
I'm pressing backwards.

1000
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:38,560
Can you turn around, Torrent?

1001
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:40,560
I'm feeling 2016.

1002
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:49,560
I'm feeling Turkey Tom with this one, boys.

1003
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:53,560
I'm feeling Keemstar.

1004
01:50:53,560 --> 01:50:57,560
Oh my god.

1005
01:50:57,560 --> 01:51:04,560
How am I supposed to get down here?

1006
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:06,560
Not feeling Keemstar.

1007
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:08,560
I'm feeling a little leafy is here.

1008
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:09,560
Should I hop on surf?

1009
01:51:09,560 --> 01:51:12,560
Should I hop on some CS GO surf?

1010
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:14,560
Don't say his name in this chat.

1011
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:17,560
Don't say the A name.

1012
01:51:17,560 --> 01:51:18,560
Shibi unhint.

1013
01:51:18,560 --> 01:51:20,560
Shibi unmasked.

1014
01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:21,560
The Shabari is off.

1015
01:51:21,560 --> 01:51:24,560
You know what that means.

1016
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:31,560
I'm going back to my YouTube commentator days.

1017
01:51:31,560 --> 01:51:35,560
Did you know when I was in a call with I'm Alex

1018
01:51:35,560 --> 01:51:43,560
and Hyogen and Pyro that Hyogen called me the N word?

1019
01:51:43,560 --> 01:51:46,560
I was like very floored.

1020
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:54,560
I was just solidly like, huh?

1021
01:51:54,560 --> 01:51:55,560
What?

1022
01:51:55,560 --> 01:51:56,560
Oh yeah.

1023
01:51:56,560 --> 01:51:57,560
By the way, if you're new here, hi.

1024
01:51:57,560 --> 01:51:58,560
My name is Shibi.

1025
01:51:58,560 --> 01:51:59,560
I used to work for Drama Alert.

1026
01:51:59,560 --> 01:52:01,560
I used to be a YouTube commentator.

1027
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:07,560
Was this live?

1028
01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:08,560
No, no, no, no.

1029
01:52:08,560 --> 01:52:09,560
This was not live.

1030
01:52:09,560 --> 01:52:19,560
This was literally, this was literally, um, this was years ago.

1031
01:52:19,560 --> 01:52:22,560
Hi, my name is Shibi Cottonbum and Zoe Burger tried to scout me

1032
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:30,560
for an e-girl fan thing.

1033
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:31,560
Oh yeah, hard R.

1034
01:52:31,560 --> 01:52:34,560
I was like, what?

1035
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:38,560
And then I left the call because I was pissed off.

1036
01:52:38,560 --> 01:52:46,560
I'll tell you right now, UK commentators are all fucking racist.

1037
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:47,560
Hi, my name is Shibi Cottonbum.

1038
01:52:47,560 --> 01:52:49,560
I used to work with Celestia Vagan.

1039
01:52:49,560 --> 01:52:55,560
She's actually a very sweet person.

1040
01:52:55,560 --> 01:52:57,560
And she did a lot of stuff that ruined her mental health

1041
01:52:57,560 --> 01:52:58,560
and I feel very bad for her.

1042
01:52:58,560 --> 01:53:01,560
She's honestly very, very sweet.

1043
01:53:01,560 --> 01:53:03,560
Hi, my name is Shibi Cottonbum and it was really funny to watch

1044
01:53:03,560 --> 01:53:14,560
Zoe Burger become a Mormon woman.

1045
01:53:14,560 --> 01:53:18,560
Mmm.

1046
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:20,560
Strawn, you wanted me to do a whole like YouTube short

1047
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:22,560
about how I worked for Drama Alert and I'm like,

1048
01:53:22,560 --> 01:53:23,560
I'm good.

1049
01:53:23,560 --> 01:53:26,560
I don't want people to find me.

1050
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:27,560
Shit.

1051
01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:31,560
Oh, maybe I'm supposed to land on that.

1052
01:53:31,560 --> 01:53:36,560
That makes sense.

1053
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:45,560
Some crazy Shibi lore, yeah.

1054
01:53:45,560 --> 01:53:54,560
Hi, my name is Shibi Cottonbum and Colossal is crazy.

1055
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:59,560
I'm actually a very funny human being.

1056
01:53:59,560 --> 01:54:00,560
Oh, yeah.

1057
01:54:00,560 --> 01:54:02,560
I already told you guys anything of reviews hit on me

1058
01:54:02,560 --> 01:54:18,560
when I went to a PAX and I was like, please go away.

1059
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:20,560
Let's see here.

1060
01:54:20,560 --> 01:54:24,560
I feel like if I jump off, it's just not going to work.

1061
01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:31,560
I might have to look at a YouTube tutorial about this.

1062
01:54:31,560 --> 01:54:32,560
Can I give you the N-word pass?

1063
01:54:32,560 --> 01:54:34,560
No, you're fucking stupid.

1064
01:54:34,560 --> 01:54:36,560
Oh my God.

1065
01:54:36,560 --> 01:54:38,560
Mods, fucking kill him.

1066
01:54:38,560 --> 01:54:39,560
My mods are not here.

1067
01:54:39,560 --> 01:54:40,560
Mods, kill him.

1068
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:44,560
Mods, rip off his nutsack and shove him down his throat.

1069
01:54:44,560 --> 01:54:46,560
If you guys ask me for the N-word pass,

1070
01:54:46,560 --> 01:54:49,560
I genuinely fucking hate you because that's just stupid.

1071
01:54:50,560 --> 01:54:51,560
Here's half a pass.

1072
01:54:51,560 --> 01:54:53,560
No, you're fucking an idiot.

1073
01:54:53,560 --> 01:55:01,560
Even if you're just beaming, it's just annoying.

1074
01:55:01,560 --> 01:55:15,560
My name is Shibi Cottonbum and this is Jackass.

1075
01:55:15,560 --> 01:55:18,560
I don't know how to get down here.

1076
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:20,560
I generally don't understand.

1077
01:55:20,560 --> 01:55:22,560
Why did they do this?

1078
01:55:22,560 --> 01:55:24,560
Poor level design.

1079
01:55:24,560 --> 01:55:28,560
Give me a fucking rock.

1080
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:32,560
Am I right in thinking that I'm supposed to jump on this?

1081
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:34,560
Okay, I was right.

1082
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:36,560
All right, cool.

1083
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:38,560
Watch something just kill me.

1084
01:55:38,560 --> 01:55:40,560
Oh, get away.

1085
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:42,560
Get away.

1086
01:55:42,560 --> 01:55:44,560
Ow, ow, ow.

1087
01:55:44,560 --> 01:55:46,560
I don't know what this is.

1088
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:48,560
What?

1089
01:55:57,560 --> 01:55:58,560
Please don't kill me.

1090
01:55:58,560 --> 01:56:00,560
I'm really busy this day.

1091
01:56:07,560 --> 01:56:09,560
Thank you.

1092
01:56:10,560 --> 01:56:12,560
Thank you, Mod.

1093
01:56:12,560 --> 01:56:14,560
Thank you, Mod.

1094
01:56:14,560 --> 01:56:19,560
I'm feeling very toxic today.

1095
01:56:19,560 --> 01:56:22,560
I feel like airing out my grievances against people.

1096
01:56:25,560 --> 01:56:28,560
Stop crying, you fucking baby.

1097
01:56:28,560 --> 01:56:31,560
Why are there just random candles here?

1098
01:56:31,560 --> 01:56:34,560
Here's a little bit of light, so it's not completely dark for you.

1099
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:54,560
Yeah, only I can be toxic.

1100
01:56:54,560 --> 01:56:57,560
You guys can't be toxic if I'm toxic.

1101
01:56:57,560 --> 01:57:00,560
There can only be one toxic person.

1102
01:57:00,560 --> 01:57:03,560
It's either me or Chat, and I'm toxic right now.

1103
01:57:06,560 --> 01:57:08,560
What are you talking about, Mari?

1104
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:10,560
Where did you come from?

1105
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:12,560
Hello, welcome to Herrim Emotes.

1106
01:57:12,560 --> 01:57:14,560
I will never touch League.

1107
01:57:14,560 --> 01:57:16,560
You can pay me.

1108
01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:18,560
I'll take 100k for League.

1109
01:57:18,560 --> 01:57:20,560
You can pay me.

1110
01:57:20,560 --> 01:57:22,560
I'll take 100k for League.

1111
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:24,560
I'll take 100k for League.

1112
01:57:26,560 --> 01:57:28,560
100k and I'll play League.

1113
01:57:28,560 --> 01:57:30,560
I'm never fucking playing League.

1114
01:57:38,560 --> 01:57:40,560
Well, I was gonna say a million,

1115
01:57:40,560 --> 01:57:43,560
but I want actually someone to pay me 100k

1116
01:57:43,560 --> 01:57:45,560
because that seems a little bit more viable.

1117
01:57:49,560 --> 01:57:51,560
Look at all these jars.

1118
01:57:53,560 --> 01:57:55,560
I feel like I should be able to enter

1119
01:57:55,560 --> 01:57:58,560
some of these buildings, but...

1120
01:57:58,560 --> 01:58:00,560
Oh, is it a well?

1121
01:58:00,560 --> 01:58:02,560
Oh, that's where I just came out of,

1122
01:58:02,560 --> 01:58:04,560
because I'm an idiot.

1123
01:58:08,560 --> 01:58:10,560
Oh, I'm surprised there's no, like,

1124
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:13,560
evil jars in here trying to lock on to anything.

1125
01:58:13,560 --> 01:58:15,560
Oh, there we are.

1126
01:58:15,560 --> 01:58:18,560
That's not 100k, that's a dollar.

1127
01:58:18,560 --> 01:58:20,560
But thank you for the dollar.

1128
01:58:21,560 --> 01:58:23,560
Hey, y'all.

1129
01:58:25,560 --> 01:58:27,560
I shouldn't even bother, like,

1130
01:58:27,560 --> 01:58:29,560
electric doesn't bother any of these dudes.

1131
01:58:30,560 --> 01:58:32,560
Ow!

1132
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:34,560
That's not very cash money of you.

1133
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:36,560
I can't get up.

1134
01:58:36,560 --> 01:58:38,560
Yeah, meet me down here. Meet me down here.

1135
01:58:38,560 --> 01:58:40,560
Meet me down here.

1136
01:58:44,560 --> 01:58:46,560
Not resin.

1137
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:48,560
He's a furry.

1138
01:58:50,560 --> 01:58:52,560
With all this information, people are going to hunt me down

1139
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:55,560
and try to find my very disapeal.

1140
01:58:55,560 --> 01:58:57,560
Trust me, there is nothing of interest there.

1141
01:58:57,560 --> 01:58:59,560
I was literally...

1142
01:58:59,560 --> 01:59:01,560
I was a literal who

1143
01:59:01,560 --> 01:59:04,560
who just happened to know a network really well.

1144
01:59:04,560 --> 01:59:06,560
I was, but that was my V-Tweeter error.

1145
01:59:06,560 --> 01:59:08,560
I made, like, three videos,

1146
01:59:08,560 --> 01:59:10,560
and they're all gone and deleted.

1147
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:12,560
Aw.

1148
01:59:13,560 --> 01:59:16,560
I was a literal who and I flew under the radar.

1149
01:59:21,560 --> 01:59:23,560
Hey.

1150
01:59:25,560 --> 01:59:27,560
I just want to grab stuff.

1151
01:59:29,560 --> 01:59:31,560
What are you doing?

1152
01:59:41,560 --> 01:59:43,560
Got a butchering knife.

1153
01:59:43,560 --> 01:59:45,560
Where's the... I wonder where the whip is.

1154
01:59:45,560 --> 01:59:47,560
Let's be further down.

1155
01:59:47,560 --> 01:59:49,560
Why is everybody crying?

1156
01:59:49,560 --> 01:59:51,560
Pussies. Stop crying.

1157
01:59:51,560 --> 01:59:53,560
Oh, you got shoved into a jar, so what?

1158
01:59:53,560 --> 01:59:55,560
Quite harder.

1159
01:59:56,560 --> 01:59:58,560
Did I get raided? Who are you?

1160
02:00:00,560 --> 02:00:02,560
Who is this dude?

1161
02:00:03,560 --> 02:00:05,560
I can't even lock on.

1162
02:00:06,560 --> 02:00:08,560
Oh, it's a greater potentate.

1163
02:00:12,560 --> 02:00:15,560
Good thing you have terrible fucking stance.

1164
02:00:15,560 --> 02:00:18,560
Too bad I am also getting just stance broken.

1165
02:00:20,560 --> 02:00:23,560
How much fucking stamina do you have, brother?

1166
02:00:25,560 --> 02:00:27,560
You're just wearing...

1167
02:00:27,560 --> 02:00:30,560
You're just not wearing any clothes.

1168
02:00:30,560 --> 02:00:32,560
You're just wearing the caterpillar hood.

1169
02:00:38,560 --> 02:00:40,560
Good morning. Hello.

1170
02:00:41,560 --> 02:00:43,560
Why should the vaude be unlisted?

1171
02:00:43,560 --> 02:00:45,560
Why should I unlist the vaude?

1172
02:00:45,560 --> 02:00:47,560
I don't care. I'm going to speak my fucking truth.

1173
02:00:47,560 --> 02:00:49,560
Hate everybody.

1174
02:00:57,560 --> 02:01:00,560
I also should have been hating all of those people because they were all older than me.

1175
02:01:10,560 --> 02:01:12,560
She be toxic, bum.

1176
02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:14,560
It sounds like I just haven't washed my ass.

1177
02:01:14,560 --> 02:01:16,560
I washed my ass this morning when I took a shower.

1178
02:01:18,560 --> 02:01:21,560
But yeah, I never assumed that my girl is will stay up or not.

1179
02:01:25,560 --> 02:01:27,560
I'll just cut the whole first half of this vaude

1180
02:01:27,560 --> 02:01:29,560
because it's not like I did anything.

1181
02:01:29,560 --> 02:01:31,560
I'll just cut the whole first half of this vaude

1182
02:01:31,560 --> 02:01:33,560
because it's not like I did anything.

1183
02:01:33,560 --> 02:01:35,560
I'll just cut the whole first half of this vaude

1184
02:01:35,560 --> 02:01:37,560
because it's not like I did anything.

1185
02:01:37,560 --> 02:01:39,560
There's yellow paint here.

1186
02:01:39,560 --> 02:01:41,560
I thought this was...

1187
02:01:41,560 --> 02:01:43,560
Resident Evil.

1188
02:01:52,560 --> 02:01:55,560
Why are you fucking crying?

1189
02:01:55,560 --> 02:01:57,560
Oh, did that Diagro?

1190
02:01:57,560 --> 02:02:00,560
He just like wiped his sword and then it was like, never mind.

1191
02:02:00,560 --> 02:02:02,560
I came over here to fight you.

1192
02:02:02,560 --> 02:02:04,560
Come on.

1193
02:02:04,560 --> 02:02:06,560
Come on, bitch.

1194
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:24,560
Oh, I forgot that it sucks health.

1195
02:02:25,560 --> 02:02:26,560
I don't...

1196
02:02:26,560 --> 02:02:28,560
I don't like that.

1197
02:02:28,560 --> 02:02:29,560
Oh.

1198
02:02:34,560 --> 02:02:36,560
The AI for you is really good.

1199
02:02:38,560 --> 02:02:40,560
I won't lie.

1200
02:02:40,560 --> 02:02:42,560
The dodging was very impressive.

1201
02:02:46,560 --> 02:02:48,560
I don't get anything for that.

1202
02:02:48,560 --> 02:02:50,560
That's fucking stupid.

1203
02:02:50,560 --> 02:02:52,560
All right.

1204
02:02:52,560 --> 02:02:54,560
Let's go this way.

1205
02:02:54,560 --> 02:02:56,560
Wait, no, I can't.

1206
02:02:56,560 --> 02:02:58,560
Can I?

1207
02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:02,560
Why can I summon my ashes here?

1208
02:03:02,560 --> 02:03:04,560
I don't...

1209
02:03:04,560 --> 02:03:06,560
Can I just jump over with Torrent?

1210
02:03:16,560 --> 02:03:18,560
Yes, I can.

1211
02:03:18,560 --> 02:03:20,560
I saw something in the ravine though, so I'm kind of interested,

1212
02:03:20,560 --> 02:03:22,560
but since I don't know how to get back up yet,

1213
02:03:22,560 --> 02:03:24,560
I'll wait. Oh, there is a bunch of these dudes.

1214
02:03:26,560 --> 02:03:28,560
I'm just going to run away from you then.

1215
02:03:28,560 --> 02:03:30,560
Yippee.

1216
02:03:30,560 --> 02:03:32,560
Farewell.

1217
02:03:32,560 --> 02:03:34,560
It'd be funny if a dragon just totally demolished

1218
02:03:34,560 --> 02:03:36,560
this bridge and I fell to my death.

1219
02:03:40,560 --> 02:03:42,560
Now he will cross the bridge.

1220
02:03:42,560 --> 02:03:44,560
He will cross the bridge.

1221
02:03:56,560 --> 02:03:58,560
Archive broves are just going to be like,

1222
02:03:58,560 --> 02:04:00,560
she be stopped deleting streams.

1223
02:04:02,560 --> 02:04:04,560
Well, it's a gorilla.

1224
02:04:04,560 --> 02:04:06,560
Whipping hut.

1225
02:04:06,560 --> 02:04:08,560
This is where I take care of him.

1226
02:04:08,560 --> 02:04:10,560
Where...

1227
02:04:10,560 --> 02:04:12,560
Where is said perfume bottles, by the way?

1228
02:04:12,560 --> 02:04:14,560
Can you guys tell me that while I run over

1229
02:04:14,560 --> 02:04:16,560
and grab this grace? Thank you kindly.

1230
02:04:30,560 --> 02:04:32,560
Whipping hut, juniors!

1231
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:42,560
Please, hello?

1232
02:04:42,560 --> 02:04:44,560
Help.

1233
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:46,560
Where is it?

1234
02:04:46,560 --> 02:04:48,560
Tell me.

1235
02:04:48,560 --> 02:04:50,560
Where is the perfume frost bottle?

1236
02:04:56,560 --> 02:04:58,560
Type faster!

1237
02:04:58,560 --> 02:05:00,560
Faster, faster, faster!

1238
02:05:00,560 --> 02:05:02,560
Type!

1239
02:05:02,560 --> 02:05:04,560
Type faster!

1240
02:05:04,560 --> 02:05:06,560
Type faster!

1241
02:05:10,560 --> 02:05:12,560
He just stood up.

1242
02:05:12,560 --> 02:05:14,560
Oh, it's a horn sent.

1243
02:05:18,560 --> 02:05:20,560
For pity's sake,

1244
02:05:20,560 --> 02:05:22,560
your place is in the jar.

1245
02:05:24,560 --> 02:05:26,560
Nice, sainthood itself awaits you

1246
02:05:26,560 --> 02:05:28,560
within.

1247
02:05:30,560 --> 02:05:32,560
For shamans like you, this is your lot.

1248
02:05:34,560 --> 02:05:36,560
Life, where you accorded for this alone.

1249
02:05:42,560 --> 02:05:44,560
I actually hate the horn sent.

1250
02:05:44,560 --> 02:05:46,560
I'm not going to lie for just shoving people into jars.

1251
02:05:48,560 --> 02:05:50,560
It's sainthood.

1252
02:05:50,560 --> 02:05:52,560
You are one with the world and the crucible.

1253
02:05:56,560 --> 02:05:58,560
That's why I'm like,

1254
02:05:58,560 --> 02:06:00,560
Micaela, you're even more of a piece of shit.

1255
02:06:00,560 --> 02:06:02,560
I know America fucked up.

1256
02:06:02,560 --> 02:06:04,560
Everything went wrong when she showed up,

1257
02:06:04,560 --> 02:06:06,560
but like, you know.

1258
02:06:06,560 --> 02:06:08,560
Can I open a map?

1259
02:06:10,560 --> 02:06:12,560
My guess is near Bonnie Village.

1260
02:06:12,560 --> 02:06:14,560
No fucking way, bro.

1261
02:06:14,560 --> 02:06:16,560
Where's the jail?

1262
02:06:18,560 --> 02:06:20,560
It's not even showing the jail on the map.

1263
02:06:24,560 --> 02:06:26,560
Where the fuck is the jail?

1264
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:28,560
Well,

1265
02:06:30,560 --> 02:06:32,560
it's the red stuff in the bottom left over here.

1266
02:06:36,560 --> 02:06:38,560
That's a tree.

1267
02:06:40,560 --> 02:06:42,560
It's south of Bonnie Village.

1268
02:06:42,560 --> 02:06:44,560
Oh man, the bottles were not in Bonnie.

1269
02:06:46,560 --> 02:06:48,560
I don't know where all the flowers were.

1270
02:06:48,560 --> 02:06:50,560
Flowers?

1271
02:06:50,560 --> 02:06:52,560
What flowers?

1272
02:06:52,560 --> 02:06:54,560
I didn't see any fucking flowers.

1273
02:06:57,560 --> 02:06:59,560
All the way left?

1274
02:07:04,560 --> 02:07:06,560
Do you mean in the Cerulean Coast?

1275
02:07:06,560 --> 02:07:08,560
Guys, I'm asking where that frostbite...

1276
02:07:08,560 --> 02:07:10,560
You guys told me that the Bonnie...

1277
02:07:10,560 --> 02:07:12,560
It was near the Bonnie Village, the frostbite bottle.

1278
02:07:18,560 --> 02:07:20,560
Why did you... Who was talking about Bonnie Village then?

1279
02:07:20,560 --> 02:07:22,560
I'm gonna fucking end your life.

1280
02:07:22,560 --> 02:07:24,560
In Elden Ring.

1281
02:07:26,560 --> 02:07:28,560
I don't know.

1282
02:07:44,560 --> 02:07:46,560
I don't even see the Bonnie Jail, anyways.

1283
02:07:48,560 --> 02:07:50,560
Usually...

1284
02:07:50,560 --> 02:07:52,560
It shows up as a little dot, so I'm surprised they don't see it.

1285
02:07:52,560 --> 02:07:54,560
Am I just fucking blind?

1286
02:07:56,560 --> 02:07:59,920
Blue flowers with red thorns. Where's that from? I can't ever get

1287
02:08:01,320 --> 02:08:03,320
Yeah, I'm gonna elde your ring. Um

1288
02:08:04,200 --> 02:08:06,900
Limiters jails between in the grave site plane

1289
02:08:07,920 --> 02:08:11,680
Is it like there? I don't know my eye is twitching because I'm irritated

1290
02:08:13,600 --> 02:08:18,000
Ever jails are different. Oh dots are ever jails. Okay

1291
02:08:20,800 --> 02:08:24,600
It's north slightly where my court, okay, I'm gonna stay right here

1292
02:08:27,040 --> 02:08:29,680
Up and to the left slightly

1293
02:08:31,760 --> 02:08:35,120
It's in this crack of the over here here

1294
02:08:42,960 --> 02:08:46,160
Over here. Yes. Alrighty boys

1295
02:08:49,040 --> 02:08:51,040
Let's fucking zoom

1296
02:08:51,520 --> 02:08:56,640
In that general region, okay

1297
02:09:07,600 --> 02:09:10,000
I can't whistle usually that was impressive. Um

1298
02:09:14,240 --> 02:09:16,240
What am I doing?

1299
02:09:21,040 --> 02:09:27,760
I want crab legs so bad. Where can I even get crab legs?

1300
02:09:36,480 --> 02:09:40,560
Just do a mukbang of crab legs. How do you get that from car-

1301
02:09:40,640 --> 02:09:42,640
Oh

1302
02:09:49,440 --> 02:09:54,000
Joe's crab shack no there used to be one uh and it closed

1303
02:09:55,760 --> 02:09:57,760
So I have to

1304
02:09:58,400 --> 02:10:00,400
They got replaced with something else. Um

1305
02:10:01,600 --> 02:10:05,360
The last time was there. I was crying to my dad

1306
02:10:06,080 --> 02:10:10,000
Because you get remind remember so I I grew up a very christian

1307
02:10:10,720 --> 02:10:12,720
religious girl

1308
02:10:16,960 --> 02:10:18,960
Very christian very religious

1309
02:10:20,160 --> 02:10:23,120
I had no sexual inkling in me whatsoever

1310
02:10:23,840 --> 02:10:27,840
The last time I was at a joe's crab shack. I was crying to my dad

1311
02:10:28,640 --> 02:10:30,640
Because my friend had just told me

1312
02:10:32,320 --> 02:10:34,320
That she sucked a boy's pee pee

1313
02:10:35,920 --> 02:10:39,520
And I and she and then I was scared she was gonna get x communicated and I didn't know what to do

1314
02:10:40,720 --> 02:10:42,720
I

1315
02:10:43,200 --> 02:10:45,200
Was like

1316
02:10:45,360 --> 02:10:47,360
15

1317
02:10:49,760 --> 02:10:51,760
That was the last time I was at a joe's crab shack

1318
02:11:08,160 --> 02:11:10,160
It's funny

1319
02:11:10,640 --> 02:11:12,640
I

1320
02:11:12,880 --> 02:11:14,880
Over here

1321
02:11:17,440 --> 02:11:23,360
Kinkiest once married, I don't know how am I supposed to know that I am not married

1322
02:11:26,160 --> 02:11:28,160
Unless we get married

1323
02:11:33,120 --> 02:11:35,120
I will now think

1324
02:11:41,040 --> 02:11:47,360
And it was funny because she did get x communicated and I wasn't allowed to talk to her

1325
02:11:49,520 --> 02:11:51,520
What

1326
02:11:54,400 --> 02:11:57,200
And then I I talked to her like

1327
02:11:59,840 --> 02:12:01,840
Like a year ago

1328
02:12:02,800 --> 02:12:04,800
Actually, maybe less than a year ago

1329
02:12:05,600 --> 02:12:08,720
Go find a key in cave. What fucking key how

1330
02:12:09,040 --> 02:12:14,160
Oh, there's nowhere else to go. Is there another entrance that I did not see?

1331
02:12:17,360 --> 02:12:19,360
Um

1332
02:12:19,360 --> 02:12:24,800
And we met up and I'm like, oh, how oh there is uh, I'm fucking blind. I was

1333
02:12:25,520 --> 02:12:28,720
We're like, oh, how do people find out because I told my dad

1334
02:12:31,840 --> 02:12:33,840
And my dad told

1335
02:12:34,080 --> 02:12:35,440
um

1336
02:12:35,440 --> 02:12:38,480
My my friend's parents because she said if she was gonna kill herself

1337
02:12:39,680 --> 02:12:43,440
Over it and hindsight, it's fucking stupid. Um

1338
02:12:45,520 --> 02:12:48,720
Like she thought she had committed this great sin

1339
02:12:50,640 --> 02:12:56,160
And so I talked to her like a year ago and she's like married with a kid now and I'm like, this is weird

1340
02:12:59,520 --> 02:13:04,720
And that person had apparently uh, not the same guy she he had ruined her life though like she

1341
02:13:05,440 --> 02:13:07,840
Didn't talk to her parents for years because of that

1342
02:13:12,160 --> 02:13:14,160
That's wild she's a snitch

1343
02:13:14,960 --> 02:13:20,160
If your friend says she's gonna kill herself because she sucked up a guy's pee pee at age 15

1344
02:13:21,040 --> 02:13:23,840
Then I'm gonna and you don't know what to do

1345
02:13:24,800 --> 02:13:29,120
And you're like me who is so so so socially inept and didn't know how the world really worked

1346
02:13:31,120 --> 02:13:33,680
Then yeah, I guess that makes me a snitch

1347
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
Oh

1348
02:13:39,520 --> 02:13:41,840
What the fuck are you?

1349
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:51,520
Oh guys, what the hell is that?

1350
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
What the fuck is this?

1351
02:14:10,640 --> 02:14:12,640
Oh, you're actually kind of pretty

1352
02:14:14,640 --> 02:14:16,640
No

1353
02:14:17,920 --> 02:14:22,960
Never mind I take this back. I didn't think you would be able to grab me

1354
02:14:27,840 --> 02:14:31,360
Same kind of innocence when you slap on me out of your mom's hand when she was in the car because you heard her

1355
02:14:31,360 --> 02:14:34,320
Not to drink. Yeah eggs and I did I definitely have done that to my mother before

1356
02:14:35,920 --> 02:14:37,920
Oh

1357
02:14:47,920 --> 02:14:52,080
Go to sleep go to sleep the poor thing you need to be put out of your misery

1358
02:14:54,240 --> 02:15:00,640
Hmm frozen maggots, let's you know take a couple of those you never know crafting. I don't have any crafter shit

1359
02:15:03,280 --> 02:15:05,280
What's up

1360
02:15:05,600 --> 02:15:07,600
I

1361
02:15:07,920 --> 02:15:10,800
Please I can't stand the sound

1362
02:15:13,440 --> 02:15:16,560
I need no salvage. Hey, call it to my dad. Sorry

1363
02:15:18,560 --> 02:15:20,960
Please stop desist

1364
02:15:24,080 --> 02:15:27,600
You're a wretched lamentation. Hey, that's a book in the bible

1365
02:15:35,680 --> 02:15:42,720
I don't like that. I don't understand the proddling pates. They freak me the fuck out

1366
02:15:45,840 --> 02:15:47,840
Um

1367
02:15:51,520 --> 02:15:55,280
This is a scary place. I just wanted to where am I?

1368
02:15:56,320 --> 02:16:00,480
Oh, I'm under I'm underground. Oh, well, I'm I know I'm underground, but you know what I mean

1369
02:16:01,360 --> 02:16:03,360
Hey

1370
02:16:03,680 --> 02:16:08,560
What's up queen? Oh shit, you're coming at me hardcore. I just wanted to grab a key

1371
02:16:10,080 --> 02:16:14,320
You guys look so odd. You're like shadow husks key

1372
02:16:15,760 --> 02:16:17,760
Thank you

1373
02:16:18,960 --> 02:16:20,960
Jail upper level key

1374
02:16:24,240 --> 02:16:26,240
Hi queen

1375
02:16:33,680 --> 02:16:35,680
You

1376
02:16:38,480 --> 02:16:40,480
Someone fucking running at me from behind

1377
02:16:43,040 --> 02:16:45,040
Better heard someone running that was weird

1378
02:16:47,440 --> 02:16:51,940
It raises me up use it. It's funny

1379
02:17:03,520 --> 02:17:05,520
Oh

1380
02:17:13,600 --> 02:17:18,240
That's that's very accurate. It is a sound reeflings make around strongy. I I agree with this sentiment

1381
02:17:18,880 --> 02:17:24,320
Guys, I don't want to go deeper in the hole. I don't have to pee before I go down there. I think I'll go pee

1382
02:17:26,720 --> 02:17:28,720
Yellow that's a color

1383
02:17:29,440 --> 02:17:31,440
I

1384
02:17:33,040 --> 02:17:35,040
And it was all yellow

1385
02:17:40,160 --> 02:17:44,000
You use it to tell bach that he has to ignite the light and just let it shine what the

1386
02:17:44,560 --> 02:17:46,560
Gull, I'm gonna ban you

02:17:46,720 --> 02:17:51,520
Just because you just make now go to I go to read your sentence without looking at your username

1388
02:17:51,760 --> 02:17:55,680
And then you just say the most shit that does not make any fucking sense to me, bro

1389
02:17:56,480 --> 02:18:02,240
Are you on crack? Is that what you smoke crack? Is it a crack that you smoke?

1390
02:18:04,400 --> 02:18:09,040
I'm kidding. I'm not gonna ban you but I I generally wonder what's go through goes through your head

1391
02:18:10,480 --> 02:18:12,480
It's true though. Look it up

1392
02:18:15,760 --> 02:18:18,560
My design dad everybody this man created me

1393
02:18:18,720 --> 02:18:27,360
He's not yeah, it's like everything has a little bit of truth in them

1394
02:18:30,160 --> 02:18:34,160
I hope you guys know I usually will read what you guys are saying before I look at your name

1395
02:18:37,280 --> 02:18:40,960
Everything that comes out of his mouth is a shitpost. Anyways, I'm gonna go piss

1396
02:18:48,560 --> 02:18:50,560
You

1397
02:19:18,560 --> 02:19:20,560
You

1398
02:19:48,560 --> 02:19:50,560
You

1399
02:20:18,560 --> 02:20:20,560
You

1400
02:20:48,560 --> 02:20:50,560
You

1401
02:21:18,560 --> 02:21:20,560
You

1402
02:21:48,560 --> 02:21:51,760
Need to find something to make for lunch

1403
02:22:18,560 --> 02:22:21,040
You

1404
02:22:48,560 --> 02:22:57,560
Okay, what can I make for food?

1405
02:22:57,560 --> 02:23:04,560
I really want crab legs!

1406
02:23:04,560 --> 02:23:09,560
Guys, should I buy crab legs?

1407
02:23:09,560 --> 02:23:17,560
Should I order crab legs?

1408
02:23:17,560 --> 02:23:21,560
Maybe I'll play Concord and I'll revive it.

1409
02:23:21,560 --> 02:23:27,560
I'll revive the entire game with just my presence.

1410
02:23:27,560 --> 02:23:30,560
Do I really trust seafood again?

1411
02:23:30,560 --> 02:23:32,560
I don't know, man.

1412
02:23:32,560 --> 02:23:34,560
That's a great question.

1413
02:23:34,560 --> 02:23:42,560
Wait, I have to like see if there's any place that sells it.

1414
02:23:42,560 --> 02:23:43,560
Let's take a peek.

1415
02:23:43,560 --> 02:23:52,560
I'm going to be Brock for a second from Pokemon.

1416
02:23:52,560 --> 02:23:53,560
She's doing torture myself?

1417
02:23:53,560 --> 02:23:56,560
It's not torture!

1418
02:23:56,560 --> 02:23:59,560
Crab legs are healthy.

1419
02:23:59,560 --> 02:24:02,560
I honestly don't really eat red meat.

1420
02:24:02,560 --> 02:24:05,560
I usually only eat chicken and fish.

1421
02:24:05,560 --> 02:24:06,560
Not that I don't like red meat.

1422
02:24:06,560 --> 02:24:10,560
I just really just don't eat it or buy it.

1423
02:24:10,560 --> 02:24:14,560
I just don't buy it to cook it.

1424
02:24:14,560 --> 02:24:38,560
Crab legs.

1425
02:24:38,560 --> 02:24:40,560
How long will this take?

1426
02:24:40,560 --> 02:24:46,560
33 minutes?

1427
02:24:46,560 --> 02:24:48,560
They have really nice pictures of their food.

1428
02:24:48,560 --> 02:25:07,560
Fried corn?

1429
02:25:07,560 --> 02:25:09,560
I don't really like crawfish.

1430
02:25:09,560 --> 02:25:12,560
There's not a seafood I would not eat.

1431
02:25:12,560 --> 02:25:13,560
I'll tell you that right now.

1432
02:25:13,560 --> 02:25:15,560
If there's seafood, I will eat it.

1433
02:25:15,560 --> 02:25:18,560
I see food, I eat it.

1434
02:25:18,560 --> 02:25:22,560
They eat corn the long way?

1435
02:25:22,560 --> 02:25:31,560
No, I deep-throat it like it's a fucking glizzy.

1436
02:25:31,560 --> 02:25:36,560
It is expensive.

1437
02:25:36,560 --> 02:25:54,560
They have Shirley Temple, add that.

1438
02:25:54,560 --> 02:25:57,560
I've never had shrimp that I can eat the head off.

1439
02:25:57,560 --> 02:26:10,560
I've never eaten shrimp heads.

1440
02:26:10,560 --> 02:26:13,560
If I get crab legs, I will literally do a mukbang

1441
02:26:13,560 --> 02:26:18,560
and I'll pull up my webcam so you guys can see me eat all this food.

1442
02:26:18,560 --> 02:26:26,560
The tests of your love for me will be you watching me destroy crab legs.

1443
02:26:26,560 --> 02:26:30,560
I'll tell you right now, crab legs are my favorite food when I was younger.

1444
02:26:30,560 --> 02:26:35,560
I know I'm going to sound like a fat fuck right now, but I don't care.

1445
02:26:35,560 --> 02:26:41,560
Although it's funny because I would go to China buffet with my dad.

1446
02:26:41,560 --> 02:26:44,560
It's just like a buffet place.

1447
02:26:44,560 --> 02:26:49,560
They had crab legs and I would just eat plates of crab.

1448
02:26:49,560 --> 02:26:58,560
Crab legs are like, crab meat is pretty light, so it's like, I would just get lots of them.

1449
02:26:58,560 --> 02:27:02,560
Taxed right off.

1450
02:27:02,560 --> 02:27:06,560
Renact the vid of the lady eating crab legs in a truck bed while it's driving.

1451
02:27:06,560 --> 02:27:11,560
I've never seen that.

1452
02:27:11,560 --> 02:27:13,560
What?

1453
02:27:13,560 --> 02:27:23,560
I don't think that means what you think it means.

1454
02:27:23,560 --> 02:27:27,560
Let's look through.

1455
02:27:27,560 --> 02:27:31,560
Looking through.

1456
02:27:31,560 --> 02:27:37,560
Holy shit.

1457
02:27:37,560 --> 02:27:40,560
If they have something, they get two lobsters.

1458
02:27:40,560 --> 02:27:56,560
What the hell? I don't want lobster though.

1459
02:27:56,560 --> 02:27:59,560
I can order alcohol? Oh boy.

1460
02:27:59,560 --> 02:28:02,560
Should I just order like a six pack of Mike's hard?

1461
02:28:02,560 --> 02:28:08,560
Ooh, but I fucking love Mike's hard black cherry lemonade.

1462
02:28:08,560 --> 02:28:16,560
I'm tempted to make really bad decisions on Door Dash right now.

1463
02:28:16,560 --> 02:28:18,560
My dad makes scallops so good.

1464
02:28:18,560 --> 02:28:26,560
My dad's a pretty good cook.

1465
02:28:26,560 --> 02:28:32,560
Lobster. I've never been to red lobster.

1466
02:28:32,560 --> 02:28:34,560
No, I'm not going to be tweeting from the toilet.

1467
02:28:34,560 --> 02:28:37,560
Guys, I'm not like allergic to like seafood.

1468
02:28:37,560 --> 02:28:54,560
I just had bad seafood like one time and you guys think it's going to kill me.

1469
02:28:54,560 --> 02:29:16,560
I can have quail eggs. That doesn't make any sense.

1470
02:29:17,560 --> 02:29:25,560
I can have quail eggs. That doesn't make any sense.

1471
02:29:25,560 --> 02:29:29,560
Actually, this is not as expensive as I thought it was going to be.

1472
02:29:29,560 --> 02:29:35,560
It's actually not bad.

1473
02:29:35,560 --> 02:29:45,560
All right, boys.

1474
02:29:45,560 --> 02:29:48,560
It's actually not that bad.

1475
02:29:48,560 --> 02:29:50,560
I thought it was going to be like over $100.

1476
02:29:50,560 --> 02:29:56,560
It isn't actually remotely close to that.

1477
02:29:56,560 --> 02:30:01,560
Yeah, even with the 20% on top, quail eggs are all right.

1478
02:30:01,560 --> 02:30:03,560
I've seen quail eggs in the grocery store.

1479
02:30:03,560 --> 02:30:06,560
I've been tempted to get them for the cats because quail eggs are good for kitty cats.

1480
02:30:06,560 --> 02:30:11,560
It's like a nice little meal topper and a calcium from the egg shells is good.

1481
02:30:11,560 --> 02:30:14,560
But Boomi's an idiot. He'd probably just choke on something.

1482
02:30:14,560 --> 02:30:22,560
So, yeah.

1483
02:30:22,560 --> 02:30:25,560
I did it.

1484
02:30:25,560 --> 02:30:27,560
I did it, boys. I ordered it.

1485
02:30:27,560 --> 02:30:29,560
Mukbang later.

1486
02:30:29,560 --> 02:30:31,560
Is it 57 bucks?

1487
02:30:31,560 --> 02:30:35,560
Yeah, it's actually, it was actually kind of like around that amount.

1488
02:30:35,560 --> 02:30:40,560
It's like 50 something.

1489
02:30:40,560 --> 02:30:59,560
So Mukbang stream in about an hour.

1490
02:30:59,560 --> 02:31:09,560
Seeing all these crabs and Ellen Rings just making me want to eat something.

1491
02:31:10,560 --> 02:31:16,560
I have to clean off my desk.

1492
02:31:16,560 --> 02:31:19,560
Well, yeah, when I ordered the McDonald's, everything was cold.

1493
02:31:19,560 --> 02:31:21,560
Something, I don't even remember what else happened.

1494
02:31:21,560 --> 02:31:26,560
I dropped my keys in the elevator and I still haven't gotten the back yet.

1495
02:31:26,560 --> 02:31:29,560
I have a thing of wet ones right next to me because I'm ready to rumble.

1496
02:31:29,560 --> 02:31:30,560
Just kidding.

1497
02:31:30,560 --> 02:31:38,560
I have the wet ones off to the side to clean my 3DO when I'm sucking on its ears.

1498
02:31:38,560 --> 02:31:45,560
Sorry, I'm slipping on my juice box.

1499
02:31:45,560 --> 02:31:47,560
Do you guys still love me?

1500
02:31:47,560 --> 02:32:03,560
I don't know. You guys, I need reassurance.

1501
02:32:03,560 --> 02:32:08,560
Avila Mukbang was not on my bingo card today.

1502
02:32:08,560 --> 02:32:15,560
You should, you guys just have an absurd, what's it called?

1503
02:32:15,560 --> 02:32:19,560
An absurd bingo card list because I'll probably check off everything on that list.

1504
02:32:19,560 --> 02:32:21,560
I'm not lying to you.

1505
02:32:21,560 --> 02:32:23,560
You still look, okay, cool. Just checking, just checking.

1506
02:32:23,560 --> 02:32:25,560
I get brainwashed all the time.

1507
02:32:25,560 --> 02:32:28,560
So you guys know how manhara I am.

1508
02:32:28,560 --> 02:32:30,560
You're watching this stream.

1509
02:32:31,560 --> 02:32:40,560
I need, I literally just cleaned my mouse pad and I actually replaced it because I destroyed it a couple months ago before I was in v-alert.

1510
02:32:40,560 --> 02:32:43,560
And I just got the same one and it's destroyed again.

1511
02:32:43,560 --> 02:32:47,560
So I'm actually just going to keep it like that.

1512
02:32:47,560 --> 02:32:49,560
Making a lot of space.

1513
02:32:49,560 --> 02:32:50,560
I don't know, it just fell.

1514
02:32:50,560 --> 02:32:56,560
Making a lot of space on my desk so you guys can get the full appeal.

1515
02:32:56,560 --> 02:33:01,560
I can't wait for booing me to come over and try to eat everything.

1516
02:33:01,560 --> 02:33:07,560
Cool, I think this is enough room.

1517
02:33:07,560 --> 02:33:16,560
I just think you guys are going to think I'm like fat.

1518
02:33:16,560 --> 02:33:22,560
I've also been, you know what, since I'm probably going to nuke this bot, I'll be real.

1519
02:33:22,560 --> 02:33:27,560
I don't feel like I'm doing too hot in terms of like my performance.

1520
02:33:27,560 --> 02:33:34,560
I know I feel like I could be doing better because I just feel like I'm not performing well.

1521
02:33:34,560 --> 02:33:37,560
I was just like looking at my numbers and I'm like, what am I doing wrong?

1522
02:33:37,560 --> 02:33:39,560
Like I'm not growing at all.

1523
02:33:39,560 --> 02:33:40,560
It's really weird.

1524
02:33:40,560 --> 02:33:42,560
I'm just, I've just stagnated and I'm just kind of confused by it.

1525
02:33:42,560 --> 02:33:45,560
So I'm like, what can I do, you know?

1526
02:33:45,560 --> 02:33:48,560
Slurp, slurp, slurp, get you, slurp, slurp, slurp, get you.

1527
02:33:48,560 --> 02:33:51,560
Thank you, Leon.

1528
02:33:51,560 --> 02:33:53,560
Hi, Amy.

1529
02:33:53,560 --> 02:33:54,560
What's up, Amy?

1530
02:33:54,560 --> 02:33:56,560
What's up, little sis?

1531
02:33:56,560 --> 02:33:59,560
Everybody say hi to Amy.

1532
02:33:59,560 --> 02:34:03,560
My gym, my YouTube members and my gym numbers.

1533
02:34:03,560 --> 02:34:05,560
I just, I know I can be performing better.

1534
02:34:05,560 --> 02:34:07,560
So I'm wondering what I can be doing, you know?

1535
02:34:07,560 --> 02:34:09,560
I'm trying to get more sort of shorts out.

1536
02:34:09,560 --> 02:34:12,560
I have an ASMR on the way and it's all, all those stuff.

1537
02:34:12,560 --> 02:34:14,560
I know, I know it's not really up to me.

1538
02:34:14,560 --> 02:34:18,560
It's all those stuff, but you know, I get in my head.

1539
02:34:18,560 --> 02:34:20,560
Emington?

1540
02:34:20,560 --> 02:34:22,560
Big sis, why are you calling her big sis?

1541
02:34:22,560 --> 02:34:24,560
Don't, don't get it twisted.

1542
02:34:24,560 --> 02:34:26,560
She's a little sister around here.

1543
02:34:26,560 --> 02:34:28,560
Don't disrespect her.

1544
02:34:35,560 --> 02:34:36,560
I know, I know.

1545
02:34:36,560 --> 02:34:37,560
It's going to come.

1546
02:34:37,560 --> 02:34:40,560
I'm just waiting for the algo, the algo to like me.

1547
02:34:40,560 --> 02:34:46,560
And I, I didn't try the Wukong game.

1548
02:34:46,560 --> 02:34:51,560
I got up on my throne because, you know, I have other priorities

1549
02:34:51,560 --> 02:34:55,560
like buying fucking crab legs instead of black meth Wukong.

1550
02:34:55,560 --> 02:34:58,560
I'm fucking an idiot.

1551
02:34:58,560 --> 02:35:02,560
Why does she, she doesn't, can she just buy her own stuff?

1552
02:35:02,560 --> 02:35:06,560
No, I can't.

1553
02:35:06,560 --> 02:35:15,560
My priorities are food, water, shelter, bills, cats, stream related stuff.

1554
02:35:16,560 --> 02:35:19,560
Stuff that I want.

1555
02:35:19,560 --> 02:35:21,560
Maybe we can do an ASMR collab together.

1556
02:35:21,560 --> 02:35:23,560
Perhaps that'd be cool.

1557
02:35:23,560 --> 02:35:26,560
Maybe like little sister and big sister take care of you.

1558
02:35:26,560 --> 02:35:28,560
That'd be cute, actually.

1559
02:35:28,560 --> 02:35:29,560
I wouldn't mind that.

1560
02:35:29,560 --> 02:35:30,560
Thank you.

1561
02:35:33,560 --> 02:35:37,560
And also sometimes again, I get in my head about it because people think I'm like,

1562
02:35:37,560 --> 02:35:41,560
I'm very, and I can't blame them because of how abrasive I am in this stream.

1563
02:35:41,560 --> 02:35:45,560
For example, um, make money, son buy it for it.

1564
02:35:45,560 --> 02:35:48,560
And I can't make my managers don't buy any games for me.

1565
02:35:48,560 --> 02:35:51,560
I have to buy all my own games, um, but I own all my own games.

1566
02:35:51,560 --> 02:35:54,560
So it doesn't even matter.

1567
02:35:54,560 --> 02:35:58,560
Uh, the only game that I had to buy was Titanfall and I got reimbursed from that

1568
02:35:58,560 --> 02:36:01,560
by one of you guys, which I, I appreciate it and she didn't have to do that.

1569
02:36:01,560 --> 02:36:04,560
So I appreciate it.

1570
02:36:04,560 --> 02:36:05,560
Yeah.

1571
02:36:05,560 --> 02:36:07,560
I got to tell them to like, comment and subscribe.

1572
02:36:07,560 --> 02:36:08,560
That's good.

1573
02:36:08,560 --> 02:36:10,560
It's funny because like a strong, you did point out, she's like,

1574
02:36:10,560 --> 02:36:15,560
you guys have to remind your, your viewer base to subscribe to you.

1575
02:36:15,560 --> 02:36:19,560
And I don't do that often enough because normally I don't care,

1576
02:36:19,560 --> 02:36:23,560
but like I, I realize I need to do better at that.

1577
02:36:23,560 --> 02:36:28,560
Like I'm like, Hey guys, you need to, if you, if you join my content,

1578
02:36:28,560 --> 02:36:29,560
like please subscribe, please.

1579
02:36:29,560 --> 02:36:31,560
Cause the sports, the sports means helps in the YouTube algo.

1580
02:36:31,560 --> 02:36:35,560
It helps me reach more people, um, commenting anything.

1581
02:36:35,560 --> 02:36:36,560
Yeah.

1582
02:36:36,560 --> 02:36:38,560
I also need to interact on YouTube more.

1583
02:36:38,560 --> 02:36:39,560
That's my own fault.

1584
02:36:39,560 --> 02:36:44,560
Uh, I don't like, I'll like and heart some of your messages, your comments,

1585
02:36:44,560 --> 02:36:50,560
but I'm just, I just, um, I don't comment a lot and I need to do that more.

1586
02:36:50,560 --> 02:36:53,560
I need to comment back to you guys and comment on all my, um,

1587
02:36:53,560 --> 02:36:58,560
my coworker stuff, my gen mate stuff and also just people I like.

1588
02:36:58,560 --> 02:37:02,560
I know I need to use the community tab more besides posting schedules.

1589
02:37:02,560 --> 02:37:08,560
I just, I interact a lot more on Twitter and it's not,

1590
02:37:08,560 --> 02:37:10,560
it's stupid because I'm just a V Twitter on my alt account.

1591
02:37:10,560 --> 02:37:14,560
And I need to, I need to, I need to focus more on YouTube.

1592
02:37:14,560 --> 02:37:16,560
So you make more content aside from streams.

1593
02:37:16,560 --> 02:37:17,560
Yeah, I'm work, I, I'm working on that.

1594
02:37:17,560 --> 02:37:18,560
I am working.

1595
02:37:18,560 --> 02:37:19,560
So it's not like I'm not doing it.

1596
02:37:19,560 --> 02:37:20,560
I am working on that.

1597
02:37:20,560 --> 02:37:21,560
Just stuff isn't up yet.

1598
02:37:21,560 --> 02:37:22,560
It takes time to edit.

1599
02:37:22,560 --> 02:37:26,560
Um, like it gets, I hand it off to the management management,

1600
02:37:26,560 --> 02:37:29,560
hands off to the editors and the editors got to do their magic.

1601
02:37:29,560 --> 02:37:32,560
I have like, I think I have like four or five shorts on the way.

1602
02:37:32,560 --> 02:37:37,560
Uh, in fact, I need to ask, I'm going to ask management right now if I,

1603
02:37:37,560 --> 02:37:38,560
how my shorts are doing.

1604
02:37:38,560 --> 02:37:41,560
Hold on.

1605
02:37:41,560 --> 02:37:43,560
And again, there's six of us and multiple editors.

1606
02:37:43,560 --> 02:37:44,560
So just take some time.

1607
02:37:44,560 --> 02:37:46,560
Um,

1608
02:37:52,560 --> 02:37:55,560
Oh my God, there's so many fricking messages in our discord.

1609
02:37:55,560 --> 02:37:56,560
What happened?

1610
02:37:56,560 --> 02:37:57,560
What happened?

1611
02:38:03,560 --> 02:38:04,560
Are you serious?

1612
02:38:11,560 --> 02:38:12,560
Oh, bro.

1613
02:38:12,560 --> 02:38:14,560
I mean, I just saw your message in the discord.

1614
02:38:14,560 --> 02:38:18,560
I'm, that doesn't make any sense.

1615
02:38:22,560 --> 02:38:25,560
No, I just, I just saw what you posted about the collapse of bro.

1616
02:38:25,560 --> 02:38:28,560
I'm just, I'm so sick of it.

1617
02:38:28,560 --> 02:38:31,560
Oh my God, dude, we're fucking normal on YouTube.

1618
02:38:31,560 --> 02:38:33,560
Oh, I fucking hate this.

1619
02:38:55,560 --> 02:39:07,560
Sorry, I'm just reading stuff.

1620
02:39:07,560 --> 02:39:08,560
Spill the tea.

1621
02:39:08,560 --> 02:39:13,560
No, it's just, it's just more stuff that people can't,

1622
02:39:13,560 --> 02:39:18,560
can't hang out because of our 18 plus content.

1623
02:39:18,560 --> 02:39:20,560
And it's just disheartening.

1624
02:39:20,560 --> 02:39:21,560
Um,

1625
02:39:21,560 --> 02:39:23,560
but they have to join other ways.

1626
02:39:23,560 --> 02:39:26,560
I hate, I hate VT for politics so much.

1627
02:39:26,560 --> 02:39:27,560
Yeah.

1628
02:39:27,560 --> 02:39:28,560
It isn't really tea.

1629
02:39:28,560 --> 02:39:29,560
It's not tea.

1630
02:39:29,560 --> 02:39:30,560
It's not bad at all.

1631
02:39:30,560 --> 02:39:33,560
It's just like, yeah, it's just stupid.

1632
02:39:33,560 --> 02:39:35,560
Um, it happened again.

1633
02:39:35,560 --> 02:39:38,560
Like I, we expect like that's not like the people.

1634
02:39:38,560 --> 02:39:41,560
I don't even, I just don't get it though.

1635
02:39:41,560 --> 02:39:43,560
Cause they were.

1636
02:39:43,560 --> 02:39:44,560
Hold on.

1637
02:39:44,560 --> 02:39:52,560
Let me, let me message you and me.

1638
02:39:52,560 --> 02:40:02,560
And then let me message management like I wanted to.

1639
02:40:02,560 --> 02:40:03,560
Hi.

1640
02:40:03,560 --> 02:40:05,800
Let me message management like I wanted to.

1641
02:40:10,120 --> 02:40:14,960
Hi, how are my shorts and emotes coming along?

1642
02:40:19,120 --> 02:40:20,920
I put em emotes.

1643
02:40:20,920 --> 02:40:21,760
I'm fine.

1644
02:40:30,700 --> 02:40:31,520
No, I don't wanna.

1645
02:40:31,520 --> 02:40:33,760
Hey, when I do like a, like a certain emotes,

1646
02:40:33,760 --> 02:40:36,000
like a funny face on,

1647
02:40:40,160 --> 02:40:43,500
on Discord, autocorrects it to a fucking emoji.

1648
02:41:01,920 --> 02:41:03,760
Anyways, at least I'll be happy with my crab legs.

1649
02:41:08,720 --> 02:41:09,560
Okay.

1650
02:41:10,920 --> 02:41:13,720
Okay, so my emotes should be done next month.

1651
02:41:22,360 --> 02:41:23,760
But like early next month.

1652
02:41:26,760 --> 02:41:29,760
Okay, so my emotes should be done next month.

1653
02:41:31,520 --> 02:41:32,360
Okay.

1654
02:41:52,440 --> 02:41:53,280
Emotes soon.

1655
02:41:53,280 --> 02:41:54,400
Yeah, I ordered emotes a bit ago.

1656
02:41:54,400 --> 02:41:56,400
There's going through the other girls' emotes.

1657
02:41:56,400 --> 02:41:58,120
Cause again, a lot of us hit,

1658
02:41:59,320 --> 02:42:00,960
I got higher memberships.

1659
02:42:00,960 --> 02:42:03,720
And so we got more email slots all around the same time.

1660
02:42:03,720 --> 02:42:04,560
So,

1661
02:42:07,280 --> 02:42:12,120
I think management forgot to send mine out a while ago.

1662
02:42:12,120 --> 02:42:14,680
And then they sent out the other girls and then they didn't

1663
02:42:14,680 --> 02:42:15,520
mine.

1664
02:42:15,520 --> 02:42:16,360
Oh, that's fine.

1665
02:42:16,360 --> 02:42:17,560
I don't really care that much.

1666
02:42:26,560 --> 02:42:29,160
Oh, thank you, Lex.

1667
02:42:29,160 --> 02:42:30,920
Thank you, Lex for the five gifted.

1668
02:42:30,920 --> 02:42:33,160
Everybody say thank you if you got one.

1669
02:42:34,280 --> 02:42:35,960
Everybody say thank you.

1670
02:42:37,720 --> 02:42:40,000
What if I just become a crab?

1671
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:41,320
I must become a crabby bitch.

1672
02:42:41,320 --> 02:42:42,160
I'm just kidding.

1673
02:42:42,320 --> 02:42:43,160
Oh.

1674
02:43:00,200 --> 02:43:05,200
I'm thankful for people giving us a chance nonetheless.

1675
02:43:05,680 --> 02:43:08,400
But it is, it's not, it's more like, it's not,

1676
02:43:08,400 --> 02:43:10,520
because I know people want to hang out with us.

1677
02:43:10,560 --> 02:43:13,160
It's their management telling us that like,

1678
02:43:13,160 --> 02:43:16,360
hey, because they do this content

1679
02:43:16,360 --> 02:43:19,320
and because there's certain body types in this company,

1680
02:43:19,320 --> 02:43:21,000
we can't have you associating with them.

1681
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:22,000
But people think we're fine.

1682
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:23,760
Like they'll talk to us, but they just can't.

1683
02:43:23,760 --> 02:43:24,880
It just sucks.

1684
02:43:24,880 --> 02:43:25,920
Just sucks a little.

1685
02:43:28,520 --> 02:43:30,240
Thank you, Doki for the 10 gifted.

1686
02:43:30,240 --> 02:43:31,560
I appreciate it.

1687
02:43:31,560 --> 02:43:33,760
I don't know why you guys are gifting subs.

1688
02:43:33,760 --> 02:43:35,640
I don't need, it's not,

1689
02:43:35,640 --> 02:43:37,760
you guys be like, let's get her more slots.

1690
02:43:37,800 --> 02:43:40,040
So she has to order even more emotes.

1691
02:43:40,920 --> 02:43:42,200
You sub, thank you for the sub.

1692
02:43:42,200 --> 02:43:43,040
Yeah.

1693
02:43:43,040 --> 02:43:43,880
I'm sorry.

1694
02:43:43,880 --> 02:43:45,080
I'm just being really negative right now.

1695
02:43:45,080 --> 02:43:47,840
And I apologize for that.

1696
02:43:47,840 --> 02:43:48,880
But again, you guys,

1697
02:43:48,880 --> 02:43:51,000
you guys appreciate me for my realness

1698
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:52,200
because I'm a real G.

1699
02:43:56,640 --> 02:43:59,360
Crab Tuber confirmed for Gen two.

1700
02:43:59,360 --> 02:44:02,080
She will do CPT with her big ass gloves.

1701
02:44:04,840 --> 02:44:05,680
That'd be funny.

1702
02:44:06,680 --> 02:44:07,840
How about Indies?

1703
02:44:09,480 --> 02:44:12,600
Again, some, yeah.

1704
02:44:12,600 --> 02:44:14,520
Thankfully, like it's literally Indies.

1705
02:44:14,520 --> 02:44:16,640
It's, Indies are chill.

1706
02:44:16,640 --> 02:44:19,440
Like I had like Fula with such a fucking sweetheart.

1707
02:44:19,440 --> 02:44:21,400
This morning she like gifted me some Nitro.

1708
02:44:21,400 --> 02:44:22,240
And she's like, here you go.

1709
02:44:22,240 --> 02:44:23,880
And I'm like, bitch, what?

1710
02:44:23,880 --> 02:44:25,360
Queen?

1711
02:44:25,360 --> 02:44:26,880
She's like, yeah, just because.

1712
02:44:26,880 --> 02:44:29,600
And I'm like, you're gonna make me cry.

1713
02:44:30,640 --> 02:44:33,000
So I'm appreciative of some people.

1714
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:34,920
And you guys like know I like Miwa.

1715
02:44:34,920 --> 02:44:36,600
We haven't like collabed, collabed on stream yet,

1716
02:44:36,600 --> 02:44:38,200
but we definitely need to do that.

1717
02:44:42,840 --> 02:44:43,680
Yeah.

1718
02:44:46,440 --> 02:44:47,600
Show a little bit of support.

1719
02:44:47,600 --> 02:44:48,800
Oh, thank you.

1720
02:44:48,800 --> 02:44:49,640
I don't need anybody.

1721
02:44:49,640 --> 02:44:51,880
All I need is my gen mates and you guys.

1722
02:44:51,880 --> 02:44:54,000
It's all I need in my life.

1723
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:55,140
It's all I need.

1724
02:44:56,320 --> 02:44:57,200
All I need.

1725
02:44:58,840 --> 02:44:59,680
Oh yeah.

1726
02:44:59,680 --> 02:45:01,640
And then I hang out with like Toma and Chai and Maury.

1727
02:45:01,640 --> 02:45:03,240
We have a collab coming up too.

1728
02:45:05,560 --> 02:45:06,800
I prefer when VTubers are genuine

1729
02:45:06,800 --> 02:45:08,240
discussed behind the scenes topics.

1730
02:45:08,240 --> 02:45:09,960
Monkopras, Indies, because of this.

1731
02:45:12,520 --> 02:45:14,400
We're not like other corpos

1732
02:45:14,400 --> 02:45:16,200
because we're even more transparent.

1733
02:45:17,560 --> 02:45:19,440
Ow, my ankle.

1734
02:45:19,440 --> 02:45:21,280
I'm like trying to stretch my leg out.

1735
02:45:23,520 --> 02:45:24,920
I don't know what I just did.

1736
02:45:27,480 --> 02:45:28,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1737
02:45:28,320 --> 02:45:29,160
I'm not worried.

1738
02:45:29,160 --> 02:45:32,640
Like honestly, sometimes like I'll get too many calls.

1739
02:45:32,640 --> 02:45:34,280
So like I'll be like invited to this, this and this

1740
02:45:34,280 --> 02:45:35,800
and I can't keep track.

1741
02:45:35,800 --> 02:45:37,800
And so sometimes I just like to spend time

1742
02:45:37,800 --> 02:45:39,400
with you guys or my gen mates.

1743
02:45:45,760 --> 02:45:50,760
Yeah, but I'm not even worried about perceptions changing.

1744
02:45:52,120 --> 02:45:56,000
I really, it's cause they part perceptions

1745
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:57,840
won't change per se.

1746
02:45:57,840 --> 02:46:03,000
Cause if people, cause like we do 18 plus content

1747
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:04,800
maybe they literally just don't want to talk to us

1748
02:46:04,800 --> 02:46:06,920
because 18 plus content in general

1749
02:46:06,920 --> 02:46:08,440
whether we do it on YouTube or not.

1750
02:46:08,440 --> 02:46:10,600
Obviously we can't do it on YouTube cause we be banned.

1751
02:46:10,600 --> 02:46:12,320
I just don't get the logic.

1752
02:46:12,320 --> 02:46:14,400
But we are a brand risk.

1753
02:46:15,480 --> 02:46:17,020
We are a brand risk.

1754
02:46:19,880 --> 02:46:23,440
I've had people come into my maros asking me

1755
02:46:23,440 --> 02:46:26,040
not to collab with their Indie Oshi

1756
02:46:27,280 --> 02:46:29,080
when I've expressed interest

1757
02:46:30,160 --> 02:46:32,200
because they don't want me to corrupt them.

1758
02:46:33,880 --> 02:46:35,320
I don't know how I would do such a thing

1759
02:46:35,320 --> 02:46:37,280
when I am very respectful and understanding

1760
02:46:37,280 --> 02:46:39,080
if somebody doesn't like something.

1761
02:46:40,280 --> 02:46:43,280
And I'm sure the other girls have gone maros just like that.

1762
02:46:52,320 --> 02:46:53,480
And that's fine.

1763
02:46:58,720 --> 02:47:02,320
So I'm not worried about people's perception changing.

1764
02:47:03,680 --> 02:47:05,960
Cause if they're in, if they're straight forward

1765
02:47:05,960 --> 02:47:07,480
to their own own headspace like that

1766
02:47:07,480 --> 02:47:10,480
they're not probably going to accept the truth

1767
02:47:10,480 --> 02:47:12,080
which is that we're normal people.

1768
02:47:15,200 --> 02:47:17,760
But I don't want to linger on the topic anymore

1769
02:47:17,760 --> 02:47:20,520
because it's, I've talked about it before.

1770
02:47:20,520 --> 02:47:21,720
I've cried about it before.

1771
02:47:21,720 --> 02:47:22,920
I've whined about it before.

1772
02:47:22,920 --> 02:47:24,480
It's just, it's so fucking repetitive.

1773
02:47:24,480 --> 02:47:26,360
I'm being extremely fucking redundant.

1774
02:47:27,360 --> 02:47:32,360
So like, it is what it is, you know, if people change,

1775
02:47:34,360 --> 02:47:36,080
good, if they don't, whatever.

1776
02:47:36,080 --> 02:47:38,400
It's like, I gotta, you know,

1777
02:47:40,200 --> 02:47:41,200
how's that order coming along?

1778
02:47:41,200 --> 02:47:42,320
I already ordered it.

1779
02:47:42,320 --> 02:47:44,280
I'm just, let's see where it's at.

1780
02:47:46,080 --> 02:47:48,200
I should have ordered alcohol with it.

1781
02:47:49,720 --> 02:47:51,020
Can I still do it?

1782
02:47:52,040 --> 02:47:56,040
I can't, but I can add a package pickup

1783
02:47:56,040 --> 02:47:58,220
from FedEx for some reason.

1784
02:48:04,720 --> 02:48:07,520
Oh, I'm gonna have to put my bra on and go downstairs with it.

1785
02:48:14,120 --> 02:48:15,640
Why do they just message me hi?

1786
02:48:16,720 --> 02:48:18,760
My dasher just messaged me hi.

1787
02:48:18,760 --> 02:48:19,600
Hello?

1788
02:48:19,600 --> 02:48:20,440
Don't talk to me.

1789
02:48:21,720 --> 02:48:22,840
You're like 20 minutes away.

1790
02:48:22,840 --> 02:48:24,040
Why are you talking to me?

1791
02:48:27,040 --> 02:48:29,200
Please don't give me a weird dasher.

1792
02:48:31,520 --> 02:48:33,640
I don't want a fucking weird dasher.

1793
02:48:33,640 --> 02:48:35,800
They just said hi redacted,

1794
02:48:35,800 --> 02:48:38,160
but they said hi and then they sent redacted,

1795
02:48:38,160 --> 02:48:39,560
which is my name.

1796
02:48:39,560 --> 02:48:40,400
I have it.

1797
02:48:44,840 --> 02:48:45,680
Imagine.

1798
02:48:49,680 --> 02:48:51,520
Can you tell where this place is?

1799
02:48:52,480 --> 02:48:53,640
I don't know where it is.

1800
02:48:53,640 --> 02:48:55,680
I just ordered from it.

1801
02:48:55,680 --> 02:48:57,600
Don't you have a GPS bro?

1802
02:49:10,880 --> 02:49:12,640
I believe it's sent me to the wrong address.

1803
02:49:12,640 --> 02:49:16,920
I'm going to cry on stream if I don't get my crab legs.

1804
02:49:25,680 --> 02:49:26,520
I don't know.

1805
02:49:53,240 --> 02:49:55,160
Can I send a picture to my dasher?

1806
02:49:55,160 --> 02:49:56,240
I don't know if I can.

1807
02:50:00,280 --> 02:50:02,080
Cause I think I found the website.

1808
02:50:12,640 --> 02:50:13,480
Oh my God.

1809
02:50:13,480 --> 02:50:16,560
How did DoorDash send them to the wrong address bro?

1810
02:50:19,840 --> 02:50:20,840
It's not bareful.

1811
02:50:20,840 --> 02:50:22,240
It's fucking DoorDash is full.

1812
02:50:22,240 --> 02:50:24,200
I'm literally just gonna,

1813
02:50:25,080 --> 02:50:28,400
throw myself off my balcony and minecraft for real.

1814
02:50:36,080 --> 02:50:37,520
At least I have some lemonade.

1815
02:50:38,960 --> 02:50:40,800
I can open the fucking...

1816
02:50:43,160 --> 02:50:44,960
Eleanor, you're suspenseful music.

1817
02:50:49,840 --> 02:50:51,800
What if the driver was a fan and got shy

1818
02:50:51,800 --> 02:50:53,080
when he heard your voice and ran off?

1819
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:56,240
I don't think that's the case.

1820
02:50:58,040 --> 02:50:58,880
It's funny.

1821
02:50:58,880 --> 02:51:00,560
I have this fear that someone's gonna be able

1822
02:51:00,560 --> 02:51:02,520
to tell who I am by my nails.

1823
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:08,280
And if the clothing I'm describing that day,

1824
02:51:08,280 --> 02:51:09,880
I'm not even a big VTuber.

1825
02:51:09,880 --> 02:51:12,040
I'm pretty, I'm so small.

1826
02:51:13,800 --> 02:51:16,920
I'm so nervous that someone's gonna find me

1827
02:51:16,920 --> 02:51:19,480
and look at my toes and be like,

1828
02:51:20,480 --> 02:51:22,320
and I'm brown and they'll be like,

1829
02:51:22,320 --> 02:51:24,080
that's fucking she be cotton bum.

1830
02:51:25,960 --> 02:51:27,280
They're gonna look at my purple toenails

1831
02:51:27,280 --> 02:51:29,360
and be like, that's her.

1832
02:51:29,360 --> 02:51:31,200
And I'm gonna talk, I'm gonna open my talk

1833
02:51:31,200 --> 02:51:32,920
and say something and they're gonna be like,

1834
02:51:32,920 --> 02:51:33,760
it's fucking you.

1835
02:51:33,760 --> 02:51:36,760
I'm gonna be like, shit, I look like a rat right now.

1836
02:51:36,760 --> 02:51:37,600
I'm not cute.

1837
02:51:37,600 --> 02:51:38,840
I'm not wearing any makeup.

1838
02:51:49,480 --> 02:51:50,320
I'm sorry.

1839
02:52:01,360 --> 02:52:02,720
You start lying about my appearance.

1840
02:52:02,720 --> 02:52:03,560
I'm a white woman.

1841
02:52:05,760 --> 02:52:06,600
I'm sorry.

1842
02:52:08,320 --> 02:52:09,560
I'm half of a white woman.

1843
02:52:10,320 --> 02:52:15,320
Hi, my name is Sheeby Cotton Bum and...

1844
02:52:18,080 --> 02:52:20,120
Okay, you're gonna call Dordash.

1845
02:52:20,120 --> 02:52:22,160
Sorry, I didn't mean to hit my space bar.

1846
02:52:23,480 --> 02:52:25,160
Okay, good luck.

1847
02:52:26,960 --> 02:52:28,600
Because it said they confirmed the order.

1848
02:52:28,600 --> 02:52:31,160
How can they confirm the order if it doesn't exist?

1849
02:52:33,160 --> 02:52:34,000
I don't know.

1850
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:34,840
I don't know.

1851
02:52:34,840 --> 02:52:35,680
I don't know.

1852
02:52:35,680 --> 02:52:36,520
I don't know.

1853
02:52:36,520 --> 02:52:37,360
I don't know.

1854
02:52:37,360 --> 02:52:38,200
I don't know.

1855
02:52:38,200 --> 02:52:39,040
I don't know.

1856
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:47,840
Is it?

1857
02:52:53,760 --> 02:52:55,560
This person is in the wrong spot.

1858
02:53:05,160 --> 02:53:07,520
I think my down shirt is just a fucking idiot

1859
02:53:07,520 --> 02:53:08,560
because I'm looking at the map.

1860
02:53:08,560 --> 02:53:10,320
They're not even near the fucking building

1861
02:53:10,320 --> 02:53:11,720
that it's showing on Dordash.

1862
02:53:11,720 --> 02:53:13,320
I just...

1863
02:53:13,320 --> 02:53:14,400
I can't...

1864
02:53:18,120 --> 02:53:19,200
You know what's funny?

1865
02:53:19,200 --> 02:53:23,800
Yesterday, I think, what did I get yesterday for food?

1866
02:53:23,800 --> 02:53:24,960
I forget what I got.

1867
02:53:25,840 --> 02:53:26,840
I ordered something too.

1868
02:53:26,840 --> 02:53:28,760
And I, oh yeah, I ordered a burrito.

1869
02:53:30,080 --> 02:53:32,360
And I'm like, hey, you can just leave it in the lobby.

1870
02:53:32,360 --> 02:53:34,520
And they're like, I can't, I'm coming inside.

1871
02:53:34,520 --> 02:53:36,000
And I'm like, you can just leave it in the lobby

1872
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:36,840
and take a picture.

1873
02:53:37,080 --> 02:53:38,840
Okay, where do I go?

1874
02:53:38,840 --> 02:53:39,840
How do I get up this?

1875
02:53:39,840 --> 02:53:41,280
How do I get, how do I get to the elevator?

1876
02:53:41,280 --> 02:53:42,120
The door is locked.

1877
02:53:42,120 --> 02:53:44,840
I'm like, you can just leave it in the fucking lobby

1878
02:53:44,840 --> 02:53:47,720
and take a photo, ma'am.

1879
02:53:48,960 --> 02:53:50,160
Please.

1880
02:53:59,720 --> 02:54:02,640
Sorry, I'm staring at the Dordash map right now.

1881
02:54:02,640 --> 02:54:04,640
He's in a completely different building.

1882
02:54:07,840 --> 02:54:09,640
My eye is twitching.

1883
02:54:12,080 --> 02:54:13,560
I literally went, where's my controller

1884
02:54:13,560 --> 02:54:14,520
that's already broken?

1885
02:54:14,520 --> 02:54:15,360
Hold on.

1886
02:54:33,440 --> 02:54:34,280
There we go.

1887
02:54:35,280 --> 02:54:37,080
That makes you feel a little bit better.

1888
02:54:41,440 --> 02:54:42,360
I just whipped it at the ground,

1889
02:54:42,360 --> 02:54:43,400
but I whipped it at the carpet

1890
02:54:43,400 --> 02:54:44,320
so you couldn't hear it that well

1891
02:54:44,320 --> 02:54:45,800
but the first time I forget.

1892
02:54:59,600 --> 02:55:00,440
Okay.

1893
02:55:02,120 --> 02:55:04,240
If I had a keyboard to break, I would do that too.

1894
02:55:05,240 --> 02:55:07,440
If you guys were near me, I'd fucking choke you.

1895
02:55:11,360 --> 02:55:13,560
Sorry, I'm just ear-sick.

1896
02:55:13,560 --> 02:55:15,960
I woke up and I choose fucking violence today.

1897
02:55:25,560 --> 02:55:27,160
I do a joking punch the mic

1898
02:55:27,160 --> 02:55:29,760
but I actually might punch it for real.

1899
02:55:30,680 --> 02:55:35,360
I don't want to actually hurt my fucking hand

1900
02:55:35,360 --> 02:55:36,680
actually punching the mic.

1901
02:55:41,280 --> 02:55:44,640
And it's not even, it's just stupidity.

1902
02:55:46,040 --> 02:55:47,200
It's just stuff.

1903
02:55:49,440 --> 02:55:51,080
It's just stuff.

1904
02:55:51,080 --> 02:55:55,680
Again, my OCD, I can't control something.

1905
02:55:55,680 --> 02:55:58,000
It's pissing me off and there's other things happening

1906
02:55:58,000 --> 02:55:59,440
and I'm getting frustrated.

1907
02:56:15,920 --> 02:56:19,800
Oh my God, dude, just walk down the fucking street.

1908
02:56:23,760 --> 02:56:24,600
Do I want to hug?

1909
02:56:24,600 --> 02:56:25,440
No.

1910
02:56:26,440 --> 02:56:28,680
I want to punch a wall like a white boy right now.

1911
02:56:28,680 --> 02:56:29,520
That's what I want to do.

1912
02:56:29,520 --> 02:56:31,520
I want to punch a hole through a door

1913
02:56:31,520 --> 02:56:33,520
for some drywall and then I feel better.

1914
02:56:35,560 --> 02:56:36,400
Can I call him?

1915
02:56:36,400 --> 02:56:38,320
I don't want to talk to this idiot on the phone.

1916
02:56:38,320 --> 02:56:40,200
Phone calls?

1917
02:56:40,200 --> 02:56:41,080
I'm still an introvert.

1918
02:56:41,080 --> 02:56:42,320
You think I can talk on the phone

1919
02:56:42,320 --> 02:56:43,400
and hold a conversation?

1920
02:56:43,400 --> 02:56:44,240
No.

1921
02:56:44,240 --> 02:56:46,320
Why do you want me to yell at this person over the phone?

1922
02:56:46,320 --> 02:56:48,520
They'll probably use my real name and dox me.

1923
02:56:53,200 --> 02:56:55,160
That's lemonade tastes like shit.

1924
02:56:55,200 --> 02:56:56,200
Why did I buy that?

1925
02:57:01,760 --> 02:57:02,960
That tastes disgusting.

1926
02:57:04,880 --> 02:57:05,760
This isn't the honest,

1927
02:57:05,760 --> 02:57:07,280
this isn't my juice box of something else.

1928
02:57:07,280 --> 02:57:08,960
Do I have a flare gun?

1929
02:57:08,960 --> 02:57:10,400
Do I shoot myself in the head with?

1930
02:57:10,400 --> 02:57:11,240
No.

1931
02:57:17,960 --> 02:57:19,040
Does she be Kyle?

1932
02:57:19,920 --> 02:57:21,480
I do have anger issues.

1933
02:57:21,480 --> 02:57:23,920
Oh, you're facing the right fucking way.

1934
02:57:23,920 --> 02:57:25,720
Now go down the road, dude.

1935
02:57:26,720 --> 02:57:27,720
Oh my God, no.

1936
02:57:30,520 --> 02:57:31,840
Oh my God.

1937
02:57:31,840 --> 02:57:34,840
You're getting your tipper voked, brother.

1938
02:57:34,840 --> 02:57:36,840
You're going the wrong direction.

1939
02:57:41,040 --> 02:57:43,320
No, yeah, DoorDash didn't send you the wrong way.

1940
02:57:43,320 --> 02:57:45,320
You pulled into the wrong parking lot.

1941
02:57:45,320 --> 02:57:46,320
You're going the wrong way.

1942
02:57:46,320 --> 02:57:47,320
You're going the wrong way.

1943
02:57:47,320 --> 02:57:49,200
You pulled into the wrong parking lot.

1944
02:58:04,440 --> 02:58:05,280
Did I use my feature?

1945
02:58:05,280 --> 02:58:06,720
Why the fuck would I use?

1946
02:58:08,760 --> 02:58:09,600
They're calling me.

1947
02:58:09,600 --> 02:58:10,440
Hold on.

1948
02:58:15,200 --> 02:58:16,040
Hello?

1949
02:58:18,320 --> 02:58:20,320
It was a fucking spam call.

1950
02:58:20,320 --> 02:58:21,320
It wasn't even them.

1951
02:58:24,320 --> 02:58:25,320
No, you guys wouldn't be able to hear,

1952
02:58:25,320 --> 02:58:27,320
I realize, because I have the volume down.

1953
02:58:48,320 --> 02:58:50,320
Punished for fail delivery.

1954
02:58:52,320 --> 02:58:53,320
You know what?

1955
02:58:53,320 --> 02:58:55,320
Maybe I'll make my ASMR script,

1956
02:58:55,320 --> 02:58:57,320
because I was thinking about what for to do my schedule.

1957
02:58:57,320 --> 02:58:58,320
Let's do my fucking schedule right now,

1958
02:58:58,320 --> 02:59:00,320
so I can distract you by something nice.

1959
02:59:03,320 --> 02:59:04,320
Oh, here's a DoorDasher.

1960
02:59:04,320 --> 02:59:05,320
Hold on.

1961
02:59:08,320 --> 02:59:10,320
Want to hear my customer service voice?

1962
02:59:10,320 --> 02:59:11,320
Here you go.

1963
02:59:13,320 --> 02:59:14,320
Hello?

1964
02:59:14,320 --> 02:59:16,320
Yes, you are.

1965
02:59:45,320 --> 02:59:47,320
Well, it was showing me that they were in the,

1966
02:59:47,320 --> 02:59:49,320
they were right next to the building.

1967
02:59:49,320 --> 02:59:52,320
They just kept going to the wrong one in the wrong parking lot.

1968
02:59:52,320 --> 02:59:54,320
So that's, I believe that's on the Dasher.

1969
03:00:02,320 --> 03:00:03,320
Okay.

1970
03:00:03,320 --> 03:00:05,320
Then I would just like a refund then.

1971
03:00:14,320 --> 03:00:19,320
You too.

1972
03:00:19,320 --> 03:00:20,320
Bye-bye.

1973
03:00:27,320 --> 03:00:28,320
Hold on.

1974
03:00:28,320 --> 03:00:30,320
Where's the, where's the controller?

1975
03:00:30,320 --> 03:00:32,320
I, where did the controller go?

1976
03:00:32,320 --> 03:00:34,320
I don't even know where to fucking put it.

1977
03:00:40,320 --> 03:00:41,320
Here we go.

1978
03:00:44,320 --> 03:00:46,320
Call me Tyler one.

1979
03:01:14,320 --> 03:01:16,320
I don't have anger issues.

1980
03:01:16,320 --> 03:01:17,320
I swear.

1981
03:01:19,320 --> 03:01:20,320
Again,

1982
03:01:21,320 --> 03:01:22,320
mental illness, everybody.

1983
03:01:22,320 --> 03:01:24,320
When I have an expectation that isn't met,

1984
03:01:24,320 --> 03:01:26,320
I get really fucking pissed off.

1985
03:01:26,320 --> 03:01:27,320
Okay.

1986
03:01:27,320 --> 03:01:28,320
Okay.

1987
03:01:28,320 --> 03:01:29,320
Okay.

1988
03:01:29,320 --> 03:01:30,320
Okay.

1989
03:01:30,320 --> 03:01:31,320
Okay.

1990
03:01:31,320 --> 03:01:32,320
Okay.

1991
03:01:32,320 --> 03:01:33,320
Okay.

1992
03:01:33,320 --> 03:01:34,320
Okay.

1993
03:01:34,320 --> 03:01:35,320
Okay.

1994
03:01:35,320 --> 03:01:36,320
Okay.

1995
03:01:36,320 --> 03:01:37,320
Okay.

1996
03:01:37,320 --> 03:01:38,320
Okay.

1997
03:01:38,320 --> 03:01:39,320
Okay.

1998
03:01:39,320 --> 03:01:40,320
Okay.

1999
03:01:40,320 --> 03:01:41,320
Okay.

2000
03:01:41,320 --> 03:01:44,320
Okay.

2001
03:01:44,320 --> 03:01:45,320
Fuck yeah.

2002
03:01:45,320 --> 03:01:46,320
Okay.

2003
03:01:56,320 --> 03:01:57,320
Okay.

2004
03:01:57,320 --> 03:01:58,320
Fucking refund me.

2005
03:01:58,320 --> 03:02:01,320
It's still saying they're preparing my order.

2006
03:02:01,320 --> 03:02:10,840
why don't you room she's like she's like I called them they wouldn't give me an address the door dash support

2007
03:02:16,360 --> 03:02:20,840
yes as I spent money now I have to wait to get a refund

2008
03:02:31,320 --> 03:02:41,560
I don't even know what to say I'm just irritated

2009
03:02:52,280 --> 03:02:54,760
it's like I just really wanted something to make me happy

2010
03:02:55,480 --> 03:03:00,600
I know I'm being overdramatic but again my brain works in mysterious ways

2011
03:03:04,200 --> 03:03:09,000
and I've only had coffee today and I'm just fucking hungry so I'm most I'm hangry that's

2012
03:03:09,000 --> 03:03:13,400

2013
03:03:13,400 --> 03:03:25,240
not gonna have trouble all right let's try again

2014
03:03:30,680 --> 03:03:32,840
it's still showing that the order is being made

2015
03:03:33,000 --> 03:03:48,680
oh my fucking god the door-dash lady is a fucking idiot dude

2016
03:03:48,920 --> 03:04:02,520
I am up the fucking stupidity

2017
03:04:09,640 --> 03:04:13,160
oh yeah I'm probably on my period as well let's just let's just chalk it up to PMSing and being

2018
03:04:13,160 --> 03:04:22,280
hangry um redacted these to remake your order your dash are into an issue so your order is being

2021
03:04:45,960 --> 03:04:50,360
and that they're gonna run to the same issue where the GPS is taking them to the wrong place

2022
03:04:59,000 --> 03:05:02,840
I'm so fucking tilted it's taking a lot of willpower not to spike my phone

2023
03:05:05,880 --> 03:05:17,720

if this person's able to get there get my food and then bring it here

2026
03:05:45,160 --> 03:05:47,080
I can't choke anything there's nothing to choke

2027
03:05:49,480 --> 03:05:56,360
there's nothing to beat wait there's

2028
03:06:01,480 --> 03:06:08,360
I don't know if you heard that

2029
03:06:12,280 --> 03:06:20,360

2030
03:06:21,080 --> 03:06:29,240
no I was beating up a plushie I don't know why it sounded like it was squeaking but it might have

2031

2034
03:07:01,960 --> 03:07:07,000
the fucking dumbass person before this couldn't drive one street over because they're dumb ass and

2035
03:07:07,000 --> 03:07:17,000
they're fucking idiot yes they're literally inside the fucking building I can see it on my app

2036
03:07:21,240 --> 03:07:31,320
unless it's that and unless it's like the building doesn't exist and this is like sometimes you

2037
03:07:31,320 --> 03:07:36,600
know I will say door dash sometimes the stores get added that don't exist anymore

2038
03:07:39,320 --> 03:07:43,640
and I'm wondering that if maybe the store doesn't exist although it's showing them in the building

2039
03:07:43,960 --> 03:07:47,960
so

2040
03:08:00,120 --> 03:08:05,800

I'm wondering if they gave me free food because I said I had no additional costs so I don't know

2046
03:09:02,360 --> 03:09:07,720
if maybe the fucking door dash lady fucked up and then she gave me a refund but also sent somebody

2047
03:09:07,720 --> 03:09:15,480
to go get it I I I don't know we'll find out we'll find out in three to five business days

I can't wait to delete this entire VOD.

2052
03:10:39,480 --> 03:10:43,480
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know.

2053
03:10:43,480 --> 03:10:47,480
Oh now they know I'm a hoe.

2054
03:10:47,480 --> 03:10:49,480
I'm mentally ill.

2055
03:10:49,480 --> 03:10:52,480
I'm one with the wind and sky.

2056
03:10:52,480 --> 03:10:54,480
I'm in Hera.

2057
03:10:54,480 --> 03:10:56,480
I'm so pissed.

2058
03:10:56,480 --> 03:11:00,480
And I don't even know why.

2059
03:11:00,480 --> 03:11:03,480
Here I am.

2060
03:11:03,480 --> 03:11:07,480
Getting pissed at Door Dash.

2061
03:11:07,480 --> 03:11:10,480
At the storm rage on.

2062
03:11:10,480 --> 03:11:14,480
I get pissed off at the smallest things.

2063
03:11:14,480 --> 03:11:16,480
Dun dun dun.

2064
03:11:16,480 --> 03:11:21,480
Dun dun dun.

2065
03:11:21,480 --> 03:11:25,480
Um.

2066
03:11:25,480 --> 03:11:36,480
Nice.

2067
03:11:36,480 --> 03:11:46,480
Don't, uh, don't forget everybody.

2068
03:11:46,480 --> 03:11:50,480
Um, Emmy and Strani will be collabing with Junna and Fuyo

2069
03:11:50,480 --> 03:11:52,480
Cloverfield.

2070
03:11:52,480 --> 03:11:56,480
At 2pm Eastern in about 15 minutes almost.

2071
03:11:56,480 --> 03:11:59,480
So if you guys need to pop off and go to see them,

2072
03:11:59,480 --> 03:12:01,480
I'm totally understandable with that.

2073
03:12:01,480 --> 03:12:05,480
Um, if you want to see some wholesome fun girl content.

2074
03:12:05,480 --> 03:12:08,480
Instead of me just raging at Elden Ring and getting pissed over

2075
03:12:08,480 --> 03:12:10,480
small things and, you know, go for it.

2076
03:12:10,480 --> 03:12:11,480
I understand.

2077
03:12:11,480 --> 03:12:13,480
I hope you guys enjoy.

2078
03:12:13,480 --> 03:12:16,480
I'm going to keep playing Elden Ring and do a mukbang

2079
03:12:16,480 --> 03:12:20,480
for the crab legs that I so deserve.

2080
03:12:20,480 --> 03:12:34,480
And we'll see.

2081
03:12:34,480 --> 03:12:49,480
I kind of want to see the end of the Door Dash arc.

2082
03:12:49,480 --> 03:12:51,480
Oh, my neck hurts.

2083
03:12:51,480 --> 03:12:57,480
When I was punching the plushie, I hurt my neck.

2084
03:12:57,480 --> 03:13:06,480
As you can see, it's off my body.

2085
03:13:06,480 --> 03:13:08,480
I gave myself a headache because I hurt my neck.

2086
03:13:08,480 --> 03:13:10,480
God damn it.

2087
03:13:10,480 --> 03:13:23,480
Not my arthritis.

2088
03:13:23,480 --> 03:13:25,480
Where is it?

2089
03:13:25,480 --> 03:13:26,480
Where is it?

2090
03:13:26,480 --> 03:13:27,480
Where are they?

2091
03:13:27,480 --> 03:13:31,480
I want to see where they are on the map.

2092
03:13:31,480 --> 03:13:38,480
Okay, they're like 15 minutes away.

2093
03:13:38,480 --> 03:13:39,480
How many runes in the world?

2094
03:13:39,480 --> 03:13:43,480
This Door Dash driver is fine.

2095
03:13:43,480 --> 03:13:47,480
They're getting a fucking kiss.

2096
03:13:47,480 --> 03:13:49,480
And being like, thank you for being competent.

2097
03:13:49,480 --> 03:13:51,480
Kidding, I'm not going to kiss a Door Dash driver.

2098
03:13:51,480 --> 03:13:52,480
That's disgusting.

2099
03:13:52,480 --> 03:13:55,480
It's probably like an old dude.

2100
03:13:55,480 --> 03:13:56,480
Let's check on my Tamagotchi.

2101
03:13:56,480 --> 03:14:04,480
Oh, wait, it's dead.

2102
03:14:04,480 --> 03:14:07,480
Guys, should I pick blue, purple, or green egg?

2103
03:14:07,480 --> 03:14:10,480
I've done all three before.

2104
03:14:10,480 --> 03:14:16,480
What color egg?

2105
03:14:16,480 --> 03:14:17,480
What if they're hot?

2106
03:14:17,480 --> 03:14:21,480
No, no, thank you.

2107
03:14:21,480 --> 03:14:24,480
Purple, purple, purple, blue, green, blue.

2108
03:14:24,480 --> 03:14:25,480
There's no red.

2109
03:14:25,480 --> 03:14:26,480
Purple?

2110
03:14:26,480 --> 03:14:27,480
Purple to match the nails?

2111
03:14:27,480 --> 03:14:28,480
Okay, purple it is.

2112
03:14:28,480 --> 03:14:29,480
I'm seeing a lot of purple.

2113
03:14:29,480 --> 03:14:30,480
It's cracking?

2114
03:14:30,480 --> 03:14:32,480
No, it's not cracking.

2115
03:14:32,480 --> 03:14:33,480
It's being selected.

2116
03:14:33,480 --> 03:14:34,480
It's in the spotlight.

2117
03:14:34,480 --> 03:14:36,480
It's being beamed up.

2118
03:14:36,480 --> 03:14:40,480
Okay, it's going to roll around for a bit, and then I'm going to have to spam feed it

2119
03:14:40,480 --> 03:14:43,480
because it gets depressed otherwise.

2120
03:14:43,480 --> 03:14:46,480
Oh my God, what the fuck did I do to my neck?

2121
03:14:46,480 --> 03:14:54,480
Did you guys like the rage?

2122
03:14:54,480 --> 03:14:56,480
I'm like a flush street.

2123
03:14:56,480 --> 03:14:58,480
I'm like Tyler one.

2124
03:14:58,480 --> 03:15:02,480
Or that one dude that just breaks every keyboard.

2125
03:15:02,480 --> 03:15:03,480
It was scary.

2126
03:15:03,480 --> 03:15:06,480
Why are you scared?

2127
03:15:06,480 --> 03:15:09,480
Why are you scared?

2128
03:15:09,480 --> 03:15:11,480
Why are you scared?

2129
03:15:11,480 --> 03:15:13,480
You love me more for the rage?

2130
03:15:13,480 --> 03:15:18,480
You like how real I am?

2131
03:15:18,480 --> 03:15:22,480
Do you guys still love me even though I have issues?

2132
03:15:22,480 --> 03:15:24,480
I need constant reassurance.

2133
03:15:24,480 --> 03:15:27,480
I probably have my period.

2134
03:15:27,480 --> 03:15:29,480
I'm probably PMSing.

2135
03:15:29,480 --> 03:15:31,480
I'm hungry.

2136
03:15:31,480 --> 03:15:33,480
I'm sad.

2137
03:15:33,480 --> 03:15:38,480
I need reassurance and affection.

2138
03:15:38,480 --> 03:15:40,480
Maybe I just need to jack off.

2139
03:15:40,480 --> 03:15:47,480
I don't know.

2140
03:15:47,480 --> 03:15:52,480
If you love me, please subscribe to my channel.

2141
03:15:52,480 --> 03:16:00,480
If you really love me, you can subscribe.

2142
03:16:00,480 --> 03:16:06,480
If you get me ice cream, I'll probably just shit myself.

2143
03:16:06,480 --> 03:16:09,480
I'm feeling very needy and I need reassurance.

2144
03:16:09,480 --> 03:16:12,480
Please just continue to tell me how awesome I am in the chat.

2145
03:16:12,480 --> 03:16:27,480
Thank you.

2146
03:16:27,480 --> 03:16:30,480
Sorry, I'm slapping my thigh.

2147
03:16:30,480 --> 03:16:36,480
Continue on.

2148
03:16:36,480 --> 03:16:47,480
I need to be gassed up right now.

2149
03:16:47,480 --> 03:16:57,480
Not the placeholder emotes.

2150
03:16:57,480 --> 03:17:01,480
Don't worry, you don't have to give me monetary love.

2151
03:17:01,480 --> 03:17:13,480
I just need verbal love through text right now.

2152
03:17:13,480 --> 03:17:18,480
I said gassed me up, not lied to me.

2153
03:17:18,480 --> 03:17:23,480
Shebe's a go-to FPS player.

2154
03:17:24,480 --> 03:17:28,480
You don't have to lie to my face.

2155
03:17:28,480 --> 03:17:30,480
Thank you.

2156
03:17:30,480 --> 03:17:32,480
Thank you so much.

2157
03:17:32,480 --> 03:17:42,480
Hold on, I missed the name because I looked away for a split second.

2158
03:17:42,480 --> 03:17:44,480
Thank you, Martin.

2159
03:17:44,480 --> 03:17:46,480
It's George R. Martin.

2160
03:17:46,480 --> 03:17:48,480
He's watching me right now.

2161
03:17:48,480 --> 03:17:53,480
Thank you, Flowerhead, for the remember.

2162
03:17:53,480 --> 03:17:55,480
Flowerhead celebrates two months of membership.

2163
03:17:55,480 --> 03:17:56,480
Love you, Shebe.

2164
03:17:56,480 --> 03:17:57,480
Please don't doubt that.

2165
03:17:57,480 --> 03:17:58,480
I'll always be there for you.

2166
03:17:58,480 --> 03:18:00,480
Just please don't call me stinky again.

2167
03:18:00,480 --> 03:18:01,480
I shower.

2168
03:18:01,480 --> 03:18:02,480
Sorry.

2169
03:18:02,480 --> 03:18:04,480
But not sorry.

2170
03:18:04,480 --> 03:18:15,480
You have voicemail, so you're always stinky.

2171
03:18:15,480 --> 03:18:17,480
Guys, stop lying.

2172
03:18:17,480 --> 03:18:21,480
You don't have to make fake stories like I saved your cat from your burning house.

2173
03:18:21,480 --> 03:18:28,480
I just want to be told things.

2174
03:18:28,480 --> 03:18:32,480
It hatched.

2175
03:18:32,480 --> 03:18:35,480
Why does it always hatch as a weird blob?

2176
03:18:35,480 --> 03:18:37,480
I don't really get that.

2177
03:18:37,480 --> 03:18:40,480
There's only like one baby form for Tamagotchi's.

2178
03:18:40,480 --> 03:18:42,480
I don't quite understand.

2179
03:18:42,480 --> 03:18:47,480
I thought there was going to be like three because I get the same one each time.

2180
03:18:47,480 --> 03:18:52,480
Okay, I'm just pumping it full of milk right now.

2181
03:18:52,480 --> 03:18:55,480
Okay, it's full.

2182
03:18:55,480 --> 03:18:58,480
You better be cute or we're going to have problems.

2183
03:18:58,480 --> 03:19:02,480
I've given myself a headache because I hurt my neck.

2184
03:19:02,480 --> 03:19:13,480
I'm a little dizzy, but it's fine.

2185
03:19:13,480 --> 03:19:15,480
Okay, now you're full.

2186
03:19:15,480 --> 03:19:27,480
You're full on food and now I will have you play with the cleaning Zumba.

2187
03:19:27,480 --> 03:19:28,480
Oh, thank you.

2188
03:19:28,480 --> 03:19:35,480
I appreciate it.

2189
03:19:35,480 --> 03:19:39,480
A child looks the same as every child.

2190
03:19:39,480 --> 03:19:42,480
You're the first sheep I consistently watch.

2191
03:19:42,480 --> 03:19:44,480
That's a thank you for the entertainment.

2192
03:19:44,480 --> 03:19:48,480
Oh, thank you.

2193
03:19:48,480 --> 03:19:50,480
Feeling like a Tamagotchi blob right now.

2194
03:19:50,480 --> 03:19:53,480
I need a bad bitch to pump me full of milk.

2195
03:19:53,480 --> 03:20:00,480
I can't wait to probably get sick because like this is how I like everything has just been going wrong with me for the past couple days.

2196
03:20:00,480 --> 03:20:03,480
Stuff isn't working.

2197
03:20:03,480 --> 03:20:12,480
I have to check if do me turn all downloaded.

2198
03:20:12,480 --> 03:20:16,480
Bitch, why are you still crying?

2199
03:20:16,480 --> 03:20:26,480
I have to pee again for some reason.

2200
03:20:26,480 --> 03:20:30,480
I have to toot.

2201
03:20:30,480 --> 03:20:34,480
I don't know if you guys heard that.

2202
03:20:34,480 --> 03:20:36,480
I just don't care anymore.

2203
03:20:36,480 --> 03:20:49,480
I'm disgusting.

2204
03:20:49,480 --> 03:20:50,480
Wait, what?

2205
03:20:50,480 --> 03:20:56,480
Let me see.

2206
03:20:56,480 --> 03:20:57,480
Come on.

2207
03:20:57,480 --> 03:20:59,480
You didn't have to delete that.

2208
03:20:59,480 --> 03:21:01,480
It was slightly on topic.

2209
03:21:01,480 --> 03:21:05,480
Given the fact I was talking about pumping people full of milk.

2210
03:21:05,480 --> 03:21:07,480
He got caught.

2211
03:21:07,480 --> 03:21:12,480
Do you want us to have heard it?

2212
03:21:12,480 --> 03:21:13,480
No.

2213
03:21:13,480 --> 03:21:16,480
It seems like I got muffled so you guys didn't hear.

2214
03:21:16,480 --> 03:21:18,480
But I care about you guys and I love you guys.

2215
03:21:18,480 --> 03:21:22,480
Thank you for making me happy.

2216
03:21:22,480 --> 03:21:30,480
Get positively affirm.

2217
03:21:30,480 --> 03:21:31,480

03:21:33,480 --> 03:21:34,480
Help me.

2221
03:21:34,480 --> 03:21:36,480
Help me with my schedule for next week.

2222
03:21:36,480 --> 03:21:37,480
Okay.

2223
03:21:37,480 --> 03:21:40,480
So I already have.

2224
03:21:40,480 --> 03:21:43,480
Well, I don't know if that collab is happening anymore.

2227
03:21:52,480 --> 03:21:53,480
Faith.

2228
03:21:53,480 --> 03:21:54,480
Okay.

2229
03:21:54,480 --> 03:22:03,480
I have to add faith.

2230
03:22:03,480 --> 03:22:04,480
Scary.

2231
03:22:04,480 --> 03:22:05,480
Okay.

I don't know.

2238
03:22:19,480 --> 03:22:20,480
Okay.

2239
03:22:20,480 --> 03:22:21,480
Okay.

2240
03:22:21,480 --> 03:22:22,480
Okay.

2241
03:22:22,480 --> 03:22:23,480
Okay.

2242
03:22:23,480 --> 03:22:24,480
Okay.

2243
03:22:24,480 --> 03:22:25,480
Okay.

2244
03:22:25,480 --> 03:22:26,480
Okay.

2245
03:22:26,480 --> 03:22:27,480
Okay.

2246
03:22:27,480 --> 03:22:28,480
Okay.

2247
03:22:28,480 --> 03:22:29,480
Okay.

2248
03:22:29,480 --> 03:22:30,480
Okay.

2249
03:22:30,480 --> 03:22:31,480
Okay.

2250
03:22:31,480 --> 03:22:32,480
Okay.

2251
03:22:32,480 --> 03:22:33,480
Okay.

2252
03:22:33,480 --> 03:22:34,480
Okay.

2253
03:22:34,480 --> 03:22:35,480
Okay.

2254
03:22:35,480 --> 03:22:36,480
Okay.

2255
03:22:36,480 --> 03:22:37,480
Okay.

2256
03:22:37,480 --> 03:22:38,480
Okay.

2257
03:22:38,480 --> 03:22:39,480
Okay.

2258
03:22:39,480 --> 03:22:41,480
And let's try a mirror up.

2259
03:22:41,480 --> 03:22:42,480
I don't know.

2260
03:22:42,480 --> 03:22:44,480
If you guys want to watch me play hollow cure because you guys like the wedding which stream.

2261
03:22:44,480 --> 03:22:45,480
I don't know.

2262
03:22:45,480 --> 03:22:47,480
Would you guys like me to play hollow cure or you're like, I don't really care.

2263
03:22:47,480 --> 03:22:49,480
I'm like a lot super set on it.

2264
03:22:49,480 --> 03:22:50,480
But if you guys are fine with it, it's fine.

2265
03:22:50,480 --> 03:22:55,480
I'll have faith as well.

2266
03:22:55,480 --> 03:22:56,480
Okay.

2267
03:22:56,480 --> 03:22:57,480
Hello care.

2268
03:22:57,480 --> 03:22:59,480
We've got holi care for Wednesday.

2269
03:22:59,480 --> 03:23:12,280
in me streaming on Thursday. I can't tell. I don't know if she's also working on her

2270
03:23:12,280 --> 03:23:18,300
schedule still. I think she is. Okay, I'll just strutty. You always put your streams

2271
03:23:18,300 --> 03:23:25,640
over by. It's hard to like, not, no, I'm not saying like, Oh, I'm mad. She's overlapping.

2272
03:23:25,640 --> 03:23:29,480
It's more so that I can't like, I can't just click on the time slot and type something

2273
03:23:29,480 --> 03:23:34,480
in. I have to like, go through this whole thing to avoid accidentally clicking on hers.

2274
03:23:34,480 --> 03:23:48,920
She be face. He had holy trilogy. Is that what it's called? With heart rate. We'll do

2275
03:23:48,920 --> 03:23:57,640
heart rate again. Oh, no, I don't want to move it. I just want to make it longer. Thank

2276
03:23:57,640 --> 03:24:05,800
you. Well, I'll just I'll just be guerrilla in Alden Ring. So don't worry about that.

2277
03:24:05,800 --> 03:24:11,720
Oh my God, he's approaching with my order boys. Hi, you can just leave it the lobby.

2278
03:24:35,800 --> 03:24:57,560
I'll go from the content. Like a meme review. That's a good idea. I don't. Yeah, I think

2279
03:24:58,200 --> 03:25:06,200
I just haven't been doing like, I like playing games. I don't do a lot of like,

2280
03:25:09,160 --> 03:25:18,040
hand cam stuff or just random stuff. Honestly, I don't know how Amy comes up with the stuff

2281
03:25:18,040 --> 03:25:23,640
she does, because I'm always impressed. Because she doesn't play a lot of games. She mostly does

2282
03:25:23,640 --> 03:25:38,440
like, excuse me, other stuff, like. I don't even know. Yeah, I need to do add more variety.

2283
03:25:39,320 --> 03:25:45,720
Ago just doesn't like me. I already I have dark wood. I do like dark wood, but I don't

2284
03:25:47,400 --> 03:25:49,000
dark woods hard for me to focus on.

2285
03:25:49,640 --> 03:25:56,520
I don't think I'd like, I would start it and then I don't think I'd be able to finish it. Because

2286
03:25:56,520 --> 03:25:58,040
that's what happened last time I tried to play it.

2287
03:26:09,000 --> 03:26:12,200
Watch my dash or show up with like, no food. And they're just like, sorry, I ate it.

2288
03:26:13,080 --> 03:26:16,600
Okay, more fan fiction.

2289
03:26:19,480 --> 03:26:21,960
Should be as grab skin. Maybe

2290
03:26:23,800 --> 03:26:26,840
some tearless. What sort of tearless? I don't know.

2291
03:26:29,320 --> 03:26:34,680
I don't think it's a genre issue, because I do have a quite a variety of games that I play.

2292
03:26:36,120 --> 03:26:39,720
I think I just need to add more variety besides just playing games. But then

2293
03:26:43,160 --> 03:26:46,200
Oh, Stronny's playing Titanfall on Monday.

2294
03:26:48,360 --> 03:26:52,200
So you guys are gonna see Titanfall twice. Because Stronny's playing Titanfall on Monday,

2295
03:26:52,200 --> 03:26:52,920
that's hilarious.

2296
03:26:56,680 --> 03:26:58,520
Oh, the people are playing some Elden Ring too.

2297
03:27:06,680 --> 03:27:08,200
I'll do ASMR on Saturday.

2298
03:27:08,760 --> 03:27:13,560
I don't, I was trying to think of the type of ASMR stream. I've just been like,

2299
03:27:14,120 --> 03:27:19,560
I can't, I haven't been able to think of like, what you guys would want to see more of.

2300
03:27:21,400 --> 03:27:24,920
Oh, Stronny's doing a members watch along of Tropic Thunder with a foot.

2301
03:27:28,040 --> 03:27:29,640
A food tearless. I don't know.

2302
03:27:31,240 --> 03:27:33,400
General food, Zassidon. But that's me anyways.

2303
03:27:34,200 --> 03:27:37,800
Like, I want to, I want to, I want to do something special for you guys. I want to

2304
03:27:37,800 --> 03:27:42,120
give you something that you guys would enjoy. Not stuff I do already.

2305
03:27:46,840 --> 03:27:48,280
Assassin's Creed Valhalla?

2306
03:27:54,280 --> 03:27:57,560
Feet? What about feet?

2307
03:27:58,360 --> 03:28:01,400
But we enjoy what you do already. But I want to do better.

2308
03:28:03,800 --> 03:28:04,840
A bartending game?

2309
03:28:06,280 --> 03:28:11,320
What? A little Lego? Well, I have the Legos. I still didn't make those.

2310
03:28:13,960 --> 03:28:16,120
A visual novel Valhalla? I've never heard of that.

2311
03:28:19,320 --> 03:28:25,000
Should I do, maybe I'll do the, should I do the ASMR? You're my delivery person. I just beat the

2312
03:28:25,000 --> 03:28:37,480
shit out of you. Actually, you know what? Let's do that. Saturday, ASMR, 4pm, Sheeby.

2313
03:28:45,560 --> 03:28:47,480
I don't even know what I would call, name that.

2314
03:28:47,560 --> 03:28:56,680
P.O.V., you're my delivery person.

2315
03:28:57,720 --> 03:28:59,400
Anybody order some sausage?

2316
03:29:03,480 --> 03:29:04,440
You're my doordash?

2317
03:29:09,560 --> 03:29:11,160
P.O.V., you're my doordash.

2318
03:29:14,120 --> 03:29:17,160
Now I'll put food delivery. I won't call out doordash like that.

2319
03:29:18,200 --> 03:29:25,240
Oh my god. All right. I'll have to think of an outfit. I'll just like show up in a robe.

2320
03:29:26,040 --> 03:29:29,640
You fucked up my order. You have to come inside in a tone for your sins.

2321
03:29:33,400 --> 03:29:38,200
The context will be lost with this mod, probably. Most definitely. People will be like, what?

2322
03:29:47,480 --> 03:30:02,120
My manager's posted a discord meme that says, I fear you've been blacklisted.

2323
03:30:07,880 --> 03:30:12,200
What's new? I don't stream on Sundays. That's my day off and I have to do some like

2324
03:30:13,320 --> 03:30:17,080
applying for housing stuff again. I'm just going to make that a whole day because I can't focus.

2325
03:30:17,800 --> 03:30:33,560
Yeah. I just beat you guys. They'll be like, oh, they're thinking like, oh, this is going to be a

2326
03:30:34,120 --> 03:30:38,920
no. I'm beating you up for getting my order wrong. Wait, did they even drop it off?

2327
03:30:50,040 --> 03:30:54,680
It's been like 10 minutes and this person just walking around my bed. I just told you.

2328
03:30:56,520 --> 03:30:58,200
I told you where to leave it.

2329
03:30:58,840 --> 03:31:10,840
Hey. Hi. You can leave it at the lobby for you and take a picture. I just said that.

2330
03:31:10,840 --> 03:31:33,400
I'm sure what you do. Oh, mod spotted, mod spotted. I didn't see it. What did it say?

2331
03:31:34,360 --> 03:31:35,960
I'm looking at my, I'm looking at my VOD.

2332
03:31:39,240 --> 03:31:41,960
Who's the mod? Now we can tell who you are.

2333
03:31:54,520 --> 03:31:55,960
I'm playing my own VOD.

2334
03:32:03,640 --> 03:32:08,360
Oh my, you're lucky. You're lucky my chat froze for the 50th time today.

2335
03:32:12,040 --> 03:32:17,320
Somebody just left food at the lobby score. I would actually shoot someone. No, they just assigned a

2336
03:32:17,320 --> 03:32:26,840
number. I don't remember the reason why, but it is helpful. I just can't recall why the reason is

2337
03:32:26,920 --> 03:32:30,200
helpful. Catch him and tickle his little paws.

2338
03:32:32,840 --> 03:32:35,960
Oh yeah. So we can tell who mod, which mod is who because they all have the same name.

2339
03:32:37,960 --> 03:32:41,800
Don't snitch the mod. I'm going to go tell management right now that the mod posted

2340
03:32:41,800 --> 03:32:45,560
and they're going to be murdered and I'm kidding. I'm not going to do that. I'm just teasing you.

2341
03:32:46,120 --> 03:32:47,000
I'm just teasing you.

2342
03:32:57,720 --> 03:33:15,000
I hope you have a fun collab in me. I saw a collab, bro. Heart.

2343
03:33:15,000 --> 03:33:27,880
All right. Photo? Why the heck? They didn't put it in the right place, but that's fine.

2344
03:33:28,520 --> 03:33:34,600
All right. I'll be right back. Jimmy is live. I'm going to, I need to

2345
03:33:37,960 --> 03:33:41,160
undo my camera. I'm going to plug in my camera.

2346
03:33:45,000 --> 03:33:49,400
How do you move my?

2347
03:33:53,720 --> 03:34:01,480
Okay. Crab arrived. We're about to get fucked up, boys. I need to go downstairs. I don't feel

2348
03:34:01,480 --> 03:34:08,920
like putting on a bra. It's whatever. I don't know if you heard Boomi speak when I said that.

2349
03:34:08,920 --> 03:34:22,440
That was kind of funny. I don't know. Where's my sweatshirt? I'm just going to throw a buddy over him.

03:34:26,280 --> 03:34:35,080
Hi, Boomi. Oh, what was that? He just jumped up and headbutted the wall in excitement. That was

2351
03:34:35,080 --> 03:34:41,480
adorable. I don't think you meant to do that, but it was quite cute. What time is it? 205? Okay,

2352
03:34:41,480 --> 03:34:48,120

2353
03:34:48,120 --> 03:34:56,120
more Elden Rain, but we have Fall of New Vegas. I need shoes. I can't walk around barefoot. My ass

2354
03:34:56,120 --> 03:35:06,360
is hanging out. Drive home safely. Are you ready for the mukbang?

2355
03:35:09,080 --> 03:35:12,360
No, like, he didn't hurt himself. Like, he was, he, he, don't worry, he's fine.

2356
03:35:12,920 --> 03:35:20,920
Hi. Oh, hi. Like, you know how like horses will excitedly like gallop and like kind of like buck?

2357
03:35:21,640 --> 03:35:29,960
Boomi does that. He does that. Hi. What's up? I'm, I'll try to record doing it sometime.

2358
03:35:30,760 --> 03:35:33,640
Uh-huh. Where are my keys? Where are my keys?

2359
03:35:36,360 --> 03:35:50,760
Let's not drop them down the elevator shaft, right? Right, Boomi? Excuse me. I'll trip over you.

2360
03:40:20,920 --> 03:40:50,760
Boomi, I'm home.

2361
03:40:51,640 --> 03:41:08,120
Okay, I have a Shirley Temple. I'm feeling incredible. What the fuck are you guys talking about?

2362
03:41:11,720 --> 03:41:14,760
No, is my internet going?
