00:00:30,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm going to do a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:30,000
bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit

00:01:30,000 --> 00:02:00,000
of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of

4
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:30,000
a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a

5
00:02:30,000 --> 00:03:00,000
little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little

6
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:30,000
bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit

7
00:03:30,000 --> 00:04:00,000
of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of

8
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:30,000
a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a

9
00:04:30,000 --> 00:05:00,000
little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little

10
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:12,980
Little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit

11
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:20,960
of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit

12
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,200
were a suit jacket, and made a habit of replacing sleep with coffee.

13
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:31,520
I had given this company a piece of my soul, only to watch my boss give his daughter the

14
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,120
position I had dedicated all these years working towards.

15
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:42,440
I wanted to scream in his skull, I wanted to cry like a child, but I couldn't.

16
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:48,440
I had been completely hollow for years, but now I was at my lowest low, nothing more to

17
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:55,640
strive for, nothing more to work for, nothing more to live for.

18
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:01,800
I wandered the night in a daze of utter aimlessness, yet, after sinking into the dark, I soon found

19
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,800
myself bathed in light.

20
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,720
It was a woman whose opulent beauty contrasted my disheveled despair.

21
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,920
Why was it then that I had caught her attention?

22
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,720
Not of disgust or pity, but I was instead called to the front of the line in a queue

23
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,680
of some very important looking people.

24
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,040
Without a word, her eyes gave an invitation, and her smile brought me both comfort of her

25
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,080
presence and the courage to follow.

26
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:31,560
Before I knew it, I was tailing her like a child into a building I had no business being

27
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,400
in, yet one she had total command of.

28
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:41,480
Every respectable patron and worker there from the highest walks of life called her Queen,

29
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,720
and the nature of that level of respect also made her Queen to me.

30
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:50,360
She had said she had seen a familiar pain in me and spoke to me about an offer.

31
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,760
Not a new job, but a new lifestyle.

32
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:59,600
She had brought me to the VIP section of the building and had finally dawned on me, a fetish

33
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,320
club for the rich and powerful.

34
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:07,600
My work didn't even allow me time for dating, much less anything here.

35
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:12,480
My curiosity and fear were at odds, yet Queen was understanding and familiar with my flavor

36
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,920
of reluctance.

37
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,720
She believed we were kindred spirits, though I couldn't see it.

38
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,520
In display of influence, she contacted my work, securing me a paid leave in order to

39
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,560
stay in Wonderland with complete access to all of its faculties for a week, free of

40
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,560
charge.

41
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,960
At the end of my stay, I would have to give my answer to join her in this wild new life,

42
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,400
a return to mediocrity.

43
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,040
To say I enjoyed my stay was an understatement.

44
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,680
I was finally tasting what life's joys can offer.

45
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,920
After the hotel amenities, spa, bars, and 5 star buffet, my curiosity eventually turned

46
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,160
to the VIP lounge.

47
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,200
It was there where I found myself.

48
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,080
It was there where I found my answer.

49
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,920
The pleasure I had never even knew I desired.

50
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,680
The pain I had no idea I needed.

51
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,560
This is what I deserved.

52
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,880
I found it all here.

53
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:15,280
My body was subjected to sensations and punishments my deepest imagination could never conjure.

54
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,080
That was, until they had me dishing it out as well.

55
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,840
After getting just a taste of this life, I knew there was no way I could turn down Queen's

56
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,840
offer.

57
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,000
I was now bound to this place.

58
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,440
In my service to Wonderland, I had been transformed.

59
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,280
In bondage, I found my freedom.

60
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,480
Through pain, I knew pleasure.

61
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,320
Through submission, I had found my power.

62
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,040
Through domination, I had found my peace.

63
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:48,440
I became a premier worker whose services were demanded by the highest paying clients from

64
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,080
across the world.

65
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,800
Top execs, actors, even politicians would line up to get their fill of welts and rope

66
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,800
burn.

67
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,680
I had seen more money in the first month than I'd ever seen in a year of office work.

68
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:05,480
My newfound command over the sins of the flesh gained me respect of peers as well as Queen

69
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,480
herself.

70
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,840
We had grown close, a bit more than professionally.

71
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:17,240
Despite this, even I had no idea what was to come.

72
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:22,000
She never wanted us to worry, so she never told anyone of her condition.

73
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,160
And it struck her hearts like a bolt of lightning when the time came.

74
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:31,560
When she passed, the city itself seemed to stand still in respect.

75
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:37,560
She had left behind a golden legacy as a saint of whips and gags, a woman who allowed those

76
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:42,800
scorned by the pursuit of happiness to regain their sense of passion and power.

77
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,800
She saw that need in me as well as my talent for it, and so did the others.

78
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:53,280
So when she willed her entire empire to me, there were no objections.

79
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:59,040
Thanks to her, I have attained a sense of power and family that I could have never imagined.

80
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:05,080
I will make sure that Wonderland will always be a safe haven for the rejected and the hopeless.

81
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:11,200
So if you feel trapped, finding yourself in a life of all pain and no pleasure, why not

82
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,120
step by a little while?

83
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,120
I can help you find both.

84
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,120
Don't be nervous, sweetie.

85
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:28,120
I know it's a big thing wanting to enter Wonderland.

86
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:36,120
It's important to have your consent, though, because once you enter, you might realize

87
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,120
you don't want to come back out of this little rabbit hole.

88
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,120
So, what will it be?

89
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,120
I don't know.

90
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,120
Mmm, good choice.

91
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,120
You've pleased me already and we're just getting started.

92
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:09,120
Why don't I tell you a little bit more about me then?

93
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,120
Hello.

94
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,120
Hi there.

95
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,120
Hello, sweetheart.

96
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,120
My name is Evie Cottonbum.

97
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,120
I'm your mistress and the madam of Wonderland.

98
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,120
Did you enjoy the girl so far?

99
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,120
I bet you enjoyed Emmy's debut.

100
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,120
Isn't she just the cutest?

101
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,120
Hope she didn't put too much of a spell on you.

102
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,120
Okay, well, now you do well to behave and listen.

103
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,120
We've got a bit to go through, so I'll just move right along.

104
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,120
However, first things first, we're going to practice some obedience.

105
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,120
So, I'm going to have you try something for me.

106
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,120
Can you say ah?

107
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,120
Ah, say ah.

108
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,120
Or type A's in the chat.

109
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,120
Good job.

110
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,120
I'm so proud of you.

111
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,120
Okay, so hold on.

112
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,120
Let me just come and set up my desk.

113
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,120
Just a second.

114
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,120
I'm sorry, my people need me.

115
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:39,120
Don't worry about my lack of head.

116
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,120
I still give it good.

117
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,120
Don't worry about it.

118
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,120
Okay, just don't.

119
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,120
So, yeah, I know my desk is messy.

120
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,120
I'll clean it off later.

121
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,120
As mentioned, my name is Sheeby,

122
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:56,120
but you must refer to me as Madam or Miss Sheeby, if you like.

123
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,120
Close confidants, call me Sheepsters.

124
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,120
My surname may sound silly to you,

125
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:09,120
but it's a known fact in my family that we have buns of steel.

126
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,120
My last name just showcases that.

127
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:17,120
I was born on September 28th, which just happens to be Bunny Day.

128
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:23,120
My parents just seemed to have really gotten the timing right, I suppose.

129
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:29,120
I am pretty tall in my family at 168 centimeters.

130
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:35,120
That's a 5'6 in America, if you didn't know.

131
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,120
I'm a lap and polla, otherwise known as a bunny girl.

132
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:45,120
You see, I have a lovely set of floppy ears in this picture right there.

133
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,120
I can also DJ, like, I'm just kidding.

134
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,120
I also have a very nice cotton tail.

135
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:58,120
I have the many characteristics of a rabbit, like my stamina, for example.

136
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,120
I'm also very good at jumping and have quite the vertical.

137
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,120
My family is mad at me, though, because I didn't pick up basketball,

138
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,120
like a distant relative of mine.

139
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,120
Everybody get up, it's time to slam-

140
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,120
Okay.

141
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,120
So, my age.

142
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,120
That's really quite rude of you to wonder.

143
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:26,120
And although I might have some motherly qualities,

144
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,120
I'm not old enough to be your mother.

145
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:34,120
As you saw in my little introductory video,

146
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,120
I am now Queen of Wonderland,

147
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:41,120
but I retired that title out of respect for the previous owner, Rest in Peace Queen.

148
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,120
I'll go into more of what my hotel offers in the 2.0.

149
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,120
In human languages, I only fluently know English,

150
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,120
but pleasure doesn't really need words, does it?

151
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,120
I'm also fluent in bun-speak,

152
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:03,120
but my accent and pitch, it really only comes out if I'm excited.

153
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,120
It sounds a bit like your animalese,

154
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,120
but I can use it in English as well, so normally it sounds like this.

155
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,120
But if I get really excited when I'm talking to you guys,

156
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,120
and this is very rare, this is what I sound like.

157
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,120
Okay.

158
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,120
So, let's look at my likes in this likes,

159
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,120
and a little bit of trivia about me.

160
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,120
Okay.

161
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:43,120
So, first of my likes, I really do enjoy a wide range of music genres,

162
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,120
from Grunge all the way to rap.

163
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:51,120
I can't sing well, but I try my best, and I just try to have fun with it.

164
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,120
Huge fan of really any sort of techno with bass and thump,

165
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:01,120
you can really feel anything that makes me move, besides country.

166
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,120
The only good songs to come from country are Ram Ranch,

167
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,120
and Save a Horse, Ride a Cowboy.

168
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,120
I'm not the pickiest eater, but I do have my favorites.

169
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,120
I love, love, love seafood.

170
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,120
I'm a woman of opulent taste, lobster.

171
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,120
There's probably no seafood dish I wouldn't try.

172
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,120
My mother also always prided in how well I ate my veggies as a wee rabbit.

173
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,120
I even like Brussels sprouts.

174
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,120
I love pho and Spanish food as well.

175
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,120
And I have a few junky comfort foods, like Uncrustables.

176
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,120
I fucking love Uncrustables and puppy chow.

177
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,120
I don't eat dog food, just full stop.

178
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,120
It's also known as White Trash, Crack and Muddy Buddies.

179
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,120
It's plain checks, mixed toasts, and peanut butter and chocolate,

180
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,120
then covered in powdered sugar.

181
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,120
I have that really rarely though, because you know,

182
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,120
I gotta keep up this nice figure.

183
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,120
So from my hobbies, when I'm not in the dungeon,

184
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:08,120
and I mean managing the Wonderland Hotel,

185
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,120
you can catch me reading a book,

186
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:15,120
practicing my knots and gardening to name a few.

187
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,120
As you can see, I do jiu-jitsu.

188
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,120
One time during a jiu-jitsu class,

189
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,120
I accidentally put a pair to sleep with just my thighs,

190
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,120
and in a like triangle, whoopsies.

191
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,120
I love to read fantasy novels.

192
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:36,120
Any form of escapism from the bland monotony of life

193
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:40,120
is enjoyable, but I do, you know,

194
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,120
read the occasional smutty novel or two.

195
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,120
Okay, I'll have fun to the next slide.

196
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:55,120
I really enjoy horror elements in shows,

197
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,120
or shows that make you think,

198
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,120
but I do also like, you know, trashy entertainment.

199
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,120
Like Love Island, I got a text.

200
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,120
I do watch a lot of anime,

201
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,120
but I'm probably kind of labeled like a normie for my taste.

202
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:12,120
I recently watched Dungeon Mashi and Freerun, you know,

203
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,120
also Me and All the Girlies have similar tastes.

204
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,120
If the theme is really sci-fi or fantasy,

205
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,120
I like it.

206
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:25,120
If it's, yeah, you know, like Firefly, Stargate, Star Wars,

207
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,120
all of it, I'm a freaking nerd.

208
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,120
Don't tell anybody though, I have to keep up, you know,

209
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,120
an air of mystery.

210
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,120
Some games you'll see me play will be like meta-ish games.

211
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,120
I love Inscription.

212
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,120
I like Souls Likes, like Elden Ring, I like Liza P.

213
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,120
I really want to dive into more retro games,

214
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,120
and also like RPG story-driven games like Elder Scrolls,

215
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,120
horror games like Alien and Amnesia,

216
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:56,120
and I recently discovered I like Roguelikes' Cult of the Lamb.

217
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,120
I'm embarrassed to admit this.

218
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,120
I played a lot of FPS growing up like Counter-Strike 2,

219
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,120
so I'm trying to widen my horizons.

220
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:09,120
Let's just not talk about my 600 plus hours.

221
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,120
Hehehe.

222
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,120
Let's move to my dislikes.

223
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,120
Okay, these are kind of self-explanatory.

224
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,120
Don't play your music too loud.

225
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,120
Nobody else wants to hear it.

226
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,120
I don't like being in really large crowds.

227
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:26,120
It just freaks me out post Miss Rona.

228
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,120
I don't like when somebody disobeys me.

229
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,120
Do not disobey me.

230
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,120
You will not like the consequences.

231
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,120
You may think it feels good. It won't.

232
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,120
Hehehe.

233
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,120
I don't like when people correct me.

234
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:42,120
I'm the one giving correction.

235
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,120
Alright.

236
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,120
And I hate getting interrupted during any sort of playtime,

237
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,120
and I hate when people put things in the wrong place.

238
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,120
If it's there, I like organize chaos.

239
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,120
Don't freaking do it.

240
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,120
Okay.

241
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:04,120
Alright, let me bring my body back real quick like

242
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,120
so you can see this beautiful face.

243
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,120
I bet you missed it, didn't you?

244
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,120
Sniff.

245
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,120
You guys smell, by the way.

246
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,120
I hope you knew that.

247
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,120
Oh!

248
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,120
I'm so far away.

249
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,120
Let me get a little closer to you.

250
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,120
Why am I so freaking huge?

251
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,120
Hehehe.

252
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,120
Okay.

253
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,120
I'm just going to be in the corner like this.

254
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,120
So ironically enough, I'm allergic to rabbits.

255
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,120
Sorry.

256
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,120
I have INFP personality type.

257
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,120
I'm very introverted.

258
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,120
Surprisingly enough.

259
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,120
After getting into our car accident,

260
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,120
I jumped off a cliff.

261
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,120
You'll learn more about that in the explanation as to why my 2.0.

262
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,120
I have three kitty cats.

263
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,120
You might have heard them in the background because they're going crazy.

264
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,120
My little girl, big mama,

265
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,120
and my big man.

266
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,120
And I've met the voice of Mario.

267
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,120
He was super freaking sweet.

268
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,120
Sniff.

269
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,120
We got to say let's go!

270
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,120
Okay.

271
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,120
So here are some of my goals.

272
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,120
I like to be a soul's like on stream.

273
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,120
I'd be an Elden Ring already,

274
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,120
and I'd be in Lies of P off stream,

275
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,120
but you know, I would like to do something with you.

276
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,120
I would like to learn another language,

277
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,120
because everybody else is super cool,

278
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,120
and I'm not, and they all know other languages,

279
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,120
so give me a suggestion.

280
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,120
I want to have a video hit 100k views,

281
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,120
and hit 10k subs,

282
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,120
because if I reach those milestones,

283
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,120
I know I'm doing something right,

284
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,120
and that you guys are enjoying my content.

285
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,120
So you know, I hope that you enjoy what I put out.

286
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,120
I want to go to a convention,

287
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,120
because it's not like they're doing it off-key right now,

288
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,120
and be like, hey,

289
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,120
and just try to like hit people with it.

290
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,120
I think that'd be really fun to hit people

291
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,120
with iPad self.

292
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,120
I would love to release another cover.

293
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,120
You guys will see that we have covers coming up.

294
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,120
Mine's not good, but you know,

295
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,120
we can try again.

296
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,120
I would love to voice in an anime

297
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,120
or some other form of animation.

298
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,120
I would love to travel

299
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,120
off-clad with the girlies,

300
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,120
and I want to make amazing friends

301
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,120
and you know,

302
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,120
there's a lot of amazing talents out there

303
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,120
that I would love to get to know.

304
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,120
Mm-hmm.

305
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,120
Here are some of my tags.

306
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,120
So here's my general art tag.

307
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,120
It's a sheebie art.

308
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,120
I'm not going too crazy with it.

309
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,120
My alternative, my naughty art tag

310
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,120
is a bondage.

311
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,120
Memes are a bun wild.

312
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,120
My live is sheebie live.

313
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,120
Clips are a cotton bomb clips,

314
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,120
and my fan name,

315
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,120
I came up with harem

316
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,120
this morning.

317
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,120
But also someone said like harlets,

318
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,120
hairlets, I don't know.

319
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,120
My sheebie bros, whatever.

320
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,120
We'll figure it out. My Yoshi marks are a rope and a bunny.

321
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,120
It's pretty self-explanatory.

322
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,120
Okay, so my first impressions

323
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,120
of the girls, I put like where I would take them

324
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,120
on a date.

325
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,120
So for Stronny, she's hardworking,

326
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,120
and I know she loves Lord of the Rings.

327
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,120
All of the Lord of the Rings movies together

328
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,120
while we snuggle.

329
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,120
And you know, just get really under those

330
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,120
cars.

331
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,120
Mercy, I would take her to a steak house

332
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,120
cause knives.

333
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,120
I think she, you know, I'll swipe a knife for her

334
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,120
five finger discount.

335
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,120
She's dangerous, she lives life on the edge.

336
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,120
Get it?

337
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,120
Anyways,

338
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,120
Azura, I want to cook a meal together with her

339
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,120
and take her on a picnic.

340
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,120
Probably something milk based.

341
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,120
I wouldn't buy that.

342
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,120
So, yeah.

343
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,120
Getting ice cream

344
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,120
with icy would be amazing.

345
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,120
If we could just watch the sunset.

346
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,120
You know, all the Aurora Borealis

347
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,120
if we go back to her hometown.

348
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,120
And just, you know,

349
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,120
suck on some popsicles together.

350
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,120
Some icicles.

351
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,120
Iced icicles.

352
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,120
Wow, the mom jokes are out today.

353
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,120
For Amy, I want to take her to a coffee shop

354
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,120
with a book star and feeder pastry.

355
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,120
She's so cute.

356
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,120
I just want to stuff her little face with food

357
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,120
and then find her more grimoire so she can, you know,

358
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,120
get her bro back.

359
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,120
I don't really know what they got going on,

360
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,120
but it's something.

361
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,120
Okay.

362
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,120
I want to give a huge thank you

363
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,120
to Squishy Ghoul

364
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,120
and Nari.

365
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,120
They did such an amazing job.

366
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,120
If they hadn't done all the work that they did,

367
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,120
I would not be here. None of the girls would be here.

368
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,120
So thank you so much.

369
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,120
Thank you to all these other wonderful people

370
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,120
who, without

371
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,120
their help,

372
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,120
I wouldn't have all this cool stuff.

373
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,120
Like, thank you. You guys worked so freaking hard.

374
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,120
I appreciate it so much.

375
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,120
Okay.

376
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,120
Let's go to my bedroom.

377
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,120
I can shut myself off.

378
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,120
Oh, yeah.

379
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,120
Okay. I'm like in a corner. Hold on.

380
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,120
Hello.

381
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,120
Hi.

382
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,120
You can see my beautiful face.

383
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,120
I'll go through. Hold on.

384
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,120
Let me just...

385
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,120
So you got my beautiful feet.

386
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,120
My little stompers.

387
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,120
My little stompers. I'm going to step on you with them.

388
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,120
You want a sniff? Too bad.

389
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,120
You're not good enough.

390
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,120
My lovely ankles.

391
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,120
My long, luscious legs

392
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,120
covered with my beautiful

393
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,120
tights.

394
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,120
And then, you know,

395
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,120
naturally, I'm wearing shabar

396
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,120
roads, but don't get it. Don't get it twisted

397
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,120
just because I'm tied up doesn't mean

398
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,120
I'm not going to be the one calling the shots.

399
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,120
Okay, sweetheart.

400
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,120
All right. That's what I thought.

401
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,120
Ew.

402
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,120
I don't like a short skirt,

403
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,120
you know.

404
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,120
You got to air out the girls. You know what I'm saying?

405
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,120
Somebody asked,

406
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,120
does these ropes leave marks? Yes.

407
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,120
I got my little office wear. You love my,

408
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,120
you know, succulent mole.

409
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,120
I like to wear a really

410
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,120
lacy lingerie.

411
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,120
I mean, this is just a shirt.

412
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,120
It's just a normal shirt. I don't know what you're talking about.

413
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,120
And then my lovely choker.

414
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,120
It's very avant-garde, don't you think?

415
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,120
And then we have

416
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,120
my beautiful face. I'm going to quickly run through

417
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,120
my toggles. We got

418
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,120
blushing. We got

419
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,120
sweating and blushing. We got

420
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,120
hard eyes sweating and blushing.

421
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,120
Then

422
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,120
I'm going to be really, really dark

423
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,120
if you disappoint me.

424
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,120
You disgust me.

425
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,120
I'll be really upset.

426
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,120
Why the fuck did you do that piece of shit?

427
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,120
And then I can cry, which is rare.

428
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,120
So I'm not going to use that for long.

429
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,120
And then

430
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,120
I can have a

431
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,120
real mouth.

432
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,120
And then I can be like

433
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,120
holy crap.

434
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,120
When were you going to tell me your dick was so small?

435
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,120
I'm sorry.

436
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,120
And then I can question my life

437
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,120
choices.

438
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,120
Okay, let me back up

439
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,120
a little bit.

440
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,120
Okay.

441
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,120
We got

442
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,120
some more. I have a leash.

443
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,120
Yeah.

444
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,120
You're on my leash, baby boy.

445
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,120
You better fucking

446
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,120
beg.

447
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,120
We

448
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,120
get closer with that.

449
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,120
And then

450
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,120
I can also bop you.

451
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,120
So be good.

452
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,120
You're not going to like where this goes.

453
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,120
Well, this is awkward.

454
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,120
Yeah, well, those are my toggles.

455
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,120
Okay, let me show my schedule real quick.

456
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,120
Oh my god, hi.

457
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,120
So we got the 2.0 tomorrow.

458
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,120
We got another craps treasure. I was going to do Bloodborne

459
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,120
because I was hoping they would have ported it for the PC,

460
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,120
but they didn't because they suck.

461
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,120
I love you, Sony.

462
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,120
We're going to do some drunk ASMR,

463
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,120
a little drunk ASMR role play.

464
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,120
I'm a rabbit, so of course we're going to do

465
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,120
Mr. Hopps Playhouse.

466
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,120
And then I'm going to play some Class of 09.

467
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,120
A Stanley Parable because fuck, office life.

468
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,120
Call to the Lamb and then

469
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,120
Vampire the Masquerade Bloodline.

470
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,120
So I hope

471
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,120
you will enjoy.

472
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,120
Wait a second.

473
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,120
Oh, is that

474
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,120
Is it that time?

475
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,120
Is it

476
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,120
that time?

477
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,120
At long last

478
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,120
the time for edge in is over.

479
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,120
Release

480
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,120
Reflicks and feast your eyes

481
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,120
on the lovely

482
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,120
Scottish cuttlefish

483
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,120
Strummy.

484
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,120
Give her all my love.

485
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,120
Thank you.

486
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,120
Thank you.
