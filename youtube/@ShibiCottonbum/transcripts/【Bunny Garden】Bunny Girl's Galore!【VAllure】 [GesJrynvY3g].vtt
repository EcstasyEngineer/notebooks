03:00.000 --> 03:22.920
well, I feel like I'm moving 5 miles an hour

03:22.920 --> 03:24.920
I'm so tired

03:26.640 --> 03:32.560
How are you I'm not I'm not gonna lie to you

03:35.880 --> 03:43.120
At exactly four o'clock I woke up from a nap walked over to my computer impressed go live

So I'm still waking up

03:49.200 --> 03:52.520

Okay, it might be a little bit delirious

04:04.760 --> 04:08.400
Got my tea ready to rumble I

04:10.200 --> 04:13.760
Gotta remember who I am who I am I

Also, so like I got an iPad stand

04:19.680 --> 04:26.680
Thank you for your support those who look at my throne and such and I was trying to set it up so that I could use my

04:26.880 --> 04:31.760
iPad almost like a third monitor and look at chat and it was working well except I could see

04:33.280 --> 04:36.640
Like it was so tiny I couldn't see anything and I'm like oh

04:37.160 --> 04:42.640

04:42.640 --> 04:44.640
Oh

By the way, is she be short for Shabilla

05:05.320 --> 05:13.080
I'm too tired to come up with a snarky remark to that

05:15.240 --> 05:18.920
Um, oh no, I see the Tomb Raider. I don't know where I am

05:21.480 --> 05:22.600

Like

05:37.560 --> 05:39.560
Going out into the world

05:40.240 --> 05:45.560
Takes a lot out of me and interacting with people because I kept kept getting turned around like I kept

05:45.640 --> 05:49.000
Accidentally going the wrong way because my GPS was messing stuff up

05:49.000 --> 05:54.720
I was a little bit late and then the office is taken forever and so I was just so tired

05:55.440 --> 05:59.240
When I got home, but then I had to do a bunch of other stuff to prepare for stream

05:59.720 --> 06:03.000
And then like exactly three thirty eight is fell asleep on the couch

06:03.800 --> 06:05.800
and knocked out

06:07.960 --> 06:11.480
But uh, we're here we are here

06:14.680 --> 06:18.920
She beat me in losses kind of be I have no sense of direction

06:20.280 --> 06:26.600
Uh, I I never know where I am even in my town that in in my city that I've lived in for

06:26.600 --> 06:35.240
My entire life essentially, I'm like, oh, which which road do I take? Where where am I?

06:38.360 --> 06:41.160
It's not a miracle I'm awake right now. I did set an alarm

06:42.600 --> 06:47.800
But I'm like, I know I needed to just like lay down for a bit and just gain my bearings

06:48.440 --> 06:51.080
Um, but I hope you guys enjoyed Tomb Raider

06:51.800 --> 06:53.800
with IC and then

06:54.200 --> 06:56.200
ASMR with momay

06:57.080 --> 07:00.360
I am quite E.P. I am waking up

07:01.720 --> 07:06.600
Don't worry. I'll wake up though. I'm just like here. I didn't fall asleep till like 3 a.m

07:07.080 --> 07:10.760
My whole sleep schedule is messed up ever since I streamed so late

07:14.600 --> 07:16.600
A womb raider? Oh my god

07:17.080 --> 07:18.840
I already made that joke

07:18.840 --> 07:20.840
I already made the ash and dust joke

07:21.320 --> 07:22.520
the

07:22.520 --> 07:24.520
imagine dragons

07:24.920 --> 07:31.080
Oh, you like imagine dragons. Well, imagine me dragon. He's nuts across your face

07:31.960 --> 07:33.960
Got him

07:35.320 --> 07:37.320
I forget to put my ooloo mouth on

07:43.400 --> 07:46.440
I'm pretty good. I'm pretty I'm pretty I'm pretty uh

07:48.440 --> 07:49.960
I'm as

07:49.960 --> 07:55.720
I'm sort of smart as a whip that doesn't make any sense. But yeah, I have no idea what this game is about

07:57.800 --> 08:00.840
Um, I know like it might be a visual novel

08:00.920 --> 08:06.760
I went in for like a second and I saw that it was voice acted. So I turned off the voices. I'll be voice at voicing

08:08.440 --> 08:10.440
See the characters today

08:11.080 --> 08:13.080
And you guys can vote in the voices

08:13.480 --> 08:18.200
Um, it's about bunny girls. Yeah, I like I haven't watched any gameplay

08:18.760 --> 08:20.520
Haven't read

08:20.520 --> 08:25.560
Anything about it. I know it was a flavor of the month game for a very for a little bit

08:26.040 --> 08:28.040
And I'm like, okay, I'll play it

08:28.360 --> 08:29.800
um

08:29.800 --> 08:31.800
So we'll see we'll see

08:32.280 --> 08:35.000
Yawns and finds I'm surrounded by bunny girls

08:35.640 --> 08:39.320
I see this as an absolute win. Okay. I'm gonna love it

08:40.200 --> 08:44.680
I also went in just in case because like when I went to purchase the game

08:45.160 --> 08:51.320
I was like, oh wait, I hope there's not like surprise things that need to be censored. So I went and I double checked

08:52.200 --> 08:55.960
Because I didn't know if it's gonna be like a hoonipop situation. You guys are all just like tricking me

08:57.080 --> 09:01.160
And the whole world is against me tricking me pretending that stuff is normal

09:02.840 --> 09:05.800
And then it's a crazy messed up game

09:06.840 --> 09:08.840
um

09:09.240 --> 09:11.480
Yeah, so I went in there wasn't any of that

09:12.440 --> 09:14.440
I was like, okay, although

09:15.240 --> 09:20.280
I did see like when I was looking at the steam page for like a brief second when I was purchasing the game

09:20.760 --> 09:22.760
just like people's screenshots

09:23.480 --> 09:25.480
And they're all ponzu shots

09:26.840 --> 09:30.280
So I'm like, what am I getting into?

09:34.120 --> 09:39.560
Kushi jokes scare exactly she doesn't know about the level that just opens what?

09:42.200 --> 09:50.040
Excuse me. It's just a lot of fan service. It's on brand for me. What color today?

09:51.800 --> 09:54.840
What the fuck does that mean? I'm white

09:59.480 --> 10:03.000
Some I did I did tease a possible brown toggle

10:03.720 --> 10:04.760
um

10:04.760 --> 10:08.920
It's death less messed up than class of 09. I didn't expect it to be messed up

10:09.720 --> 10:15.880
As much as class of 09 panty simulator with a side of alcohol

10:18.600 --> 10:20.600
You think they meant my ponzu

10:22.360 --> 10:24.360
I don't remember

10:24.520 --> 10:26.280
um

10:26.280 --> 10:28.280
Actually, these are my favorite pairs

10:29.000 --> 10:31.880
It's like, uh, it's like rain like pastel rainbowy

10:32.520 --> 10:34.040
lace

10:34.040 --> 10:36.040
with flowers on it

10:36.200 --> 10:38.200
And um

10:42.280 --> 10:44.280
It's a thong

10:45.240 --> 10:47.240
And it's like has a lot of light blue

10:48.120 --> 10:50.760
It's nice to get my skin tone anyways. Um

10:52.440 --> 11:00.120
Usually we're nothing but I had to go out into the world today. So I decided to you know bundle up before going on an excursion

11:00.920 --> 11:02.920
I

11:03.480 --> 11:07.480
Actually fucking hate thongs. I don't even know why I have so money so money so many

11:08.920 --> 11:10.920
I need to um

11:11.080 --> 11:11.960
buy

11:11.960 --> 11:13.960
More underwear like some like cheekies

11:15.720 --> 11:17.960
I uh, I accidentally so like I

11:18.680 --> 11:23.960
I'm a huge fan of like the savage x fenty like rihanna's lingerie line

11:24.920 --> 11:31.880
And I forgot to fucking cancel my membership because they charge $59 a month for membership

11:32.440 --> 11:34.440
And you can skip the month mind you

11:35.560 --> 11:38.600
And you can like save the money, but I swear to you

11:38.680 --> 11:44.520
I thought I skipped the month and they charged me 60 bucks and I have to spend it on something and I'm like

11:44.920 --> 11:48.280
Well, it looks like I'm getting panties looks like I'm getting panties

11:49.160 --> 11:52.920
They have great stuff, but I'm like what the hell, you know

11:54.040 --> 11:56.040
I'm like what the what the what the actual fuck?

11:57.160 --> 11:59.160
Um, that's really high quality

11:59.720 --> 12:03.080
It's mostly what I wear. Although I go to the pink store sometimes. Um

12:04.680 --> 12:06.680
For a little something something

12:07.880 --> 12:11.320
It's been 10 minutes and we're talking about pansos. Yeah, what did you expect?

12:12.680 --> 12:14.520
Are you new here?

12:14.520 --> 12:17.320
Wait a minute. Who are you?

12:20.520 --> 12:22.520
What does she be

12:23.240 --> 12:29.160
It's funny. You guys have got me saying erm what the sigma and erm what the scallop

12:32.600 --> 12:37.720
I uh because like when I when my stream just wasn't loading when I press start

12:38.760 --> 12:40.760
I was like, um

12:40.840 --> 12:42.840
erm what the

12:42.840 --> 12:48.040
What the scallop and then I just like audibly sighed out loud when I when I heard what I said

12:48.840 --> 12:54.600
I'd be disappointed if you weren't still talking about random at this point random

12:56.120 --> 12:59.000
You be it's she be it's a me. She be

12:59.960 --> 13:01.960
Let's go and

13:02.840 --> 13:04.840
Yep

13:04.840 --> 13:09.480
I should put disclaimer. I'm tired of shit. I promise you. I'm not drunk

13:11.240 --> 13:15.560
I'm just tired. I usually like listen. I made a big sacrifice

13:16.440 --> 13:22.200
Streaming at the time that I do because around this time is normally my nap time

13:24.120 --> 13:26.120
My family is notorious for napping

13:27.240 --> 13:33.240
My mom's the only one that can't my whole dad's side of the family are napping champions and from

13:34.120 --> 13:36.120
four to five

13:36.840 --> 13:38.440
30

13:38.440 --> 13:44.520
Prime nap time something I've like napped for like four hours before and I still managed to get to sleep

13:44.840 --> 13:49.400
Is it depression? I don't know. Maybe she's born with it. Maybe it's

13:50.280 --> 13:52.280
dysthymia

13:54.680 --> 13:55.880
She be

13:55.880 --> 13:57.720
Did you hear a twitter room of the likes you can see?

13:58.120 --> 14:02.200
I can still see everybody's likes because I have not updated my twitter on my phone

14:02.920 --> 14:04.920
So you can't hide from me

14:06.360 --> 14:11.800
I know your secrets. I know when you're awake. I know when you've been bad or good. So be bad

14:12.760 --> 14:14.760
For goodness sake

14:20.920 --> 14:24.840
What is your favorite kind of vegetable um

14:26.360 --> 14:29.000
Is a potato a vegetable I really like potatoes

14:30.760 --> 14:32.760
Yeah, potatoes a vegetable

14:33.160 --> 14:35.160
Yeah, because I didn't have like a seed

14:36.120 --> 14:42.760
I was like the dumbest thing I've ever said is a potato a vegetable. Oh my god. Um

14:44.120 --> 14:48.520
It's funny because like technically zucchini is fruit

14:49.240 --> 14:51.240
tomatoes are fruit

14:51.880 --> 14:54.920
Like carrots are vegetable and like leafy greens are vegetables

14:56.760 --> 14:58.760
I really like all vegetables

14:59.400 --> 15:01.400
I'm like trying to think of a vegetable. I don't like

15:02.280 --> 15:08.440
Like because I'll just eat anything. I don't like like I like I'm not a huge fan of arugula, but I also eat it

15:09.400 --> 15:11.960
I really like spinach. Yep. Mm-hmm

15:13.160 --> 15:19.800
I like brussel sprouts. Did you know they've actually um engineered the bad flavor out of brussel sprouts now?

15:19.960 --> 15:22.200
Because my dad used to hate brussel sprouts

15:22.760 --> 15:25.320
And then he like threw some in the air fryer

15:25.720 --> 15:31.480
And like with a little bit of oil salt and pepper and they were like really tasty nutty almost like an artichoke heart

15:31.880 --> 15:33.880
And he's like this is not like what they taste like

15:34.520 --> 15:38.280
Back then and then we looked it up and did research and they actually engineered the shit out of there

15:39.240 --> 15:41.640
You hate bell peppers. I love bell peppers

15:43.240 --> 15:47.880
Tomatoes are both vegetables and fruit depends on which taxonomy you're using. All right

15:48.680 --> 15:50.680
I don't know what that means, but godspeed

15:51.640 --> 15:57.160
But they didn't smell so strong. Yeah, they do still smell like, you know, the devil's asshole, but it is

15:59.400 --> 16:02.360
Spinach over lettuce for salads 100% I like butter lettuce

16:03.400 --> 16:04.280
um

16:04.280 --> 16:06.280
Because it's similar to spinach

16:06.680 --> 16:09.640
Or I'll use like butter lettuce for like a lettuce wrap pretty good

16:10.920 --> 16:15.320
Why the fuck are we talking about vegetables? You know how much like this is how this is what I mean

16:16.040 --> 16:21.320
I don't know somebody asked me a question. I'm like, all right talks 10 minutes explaining my answers

16:30.840 --> 16:34.520
But her lettuce I barely know shut up get out of here

16:35.160 --> 16:38.680
I think canned steam veggies turn people off flavor so much better

16:39.160 --> 16:41.160
Baked in oil. Oh, yeah, I agree with that

16:41.320 --> 16:43.320
I prefer all like

16:43.320 --> 16:48.120
I'll eat steamed veggies because I like I like steamed broccoli or green beans. I love green beans

16:48.840 --> 16:50.840
um

16:51.320 --> 16:53.320
The best lounge chat. Yeah

16:53.880 --> 16:55.880
Yapa be cotton bum

16:56.120 --> 16:57.720
That's a me

16:57.720 --> 16:59.720
favorite breakfast

17:00.360 --> 17:01.560
You know

17:01.560 --> 17:03.560
I love french toast

17:03.720 --> 17:09.720
French toast I think was the first thing I learned how to cook after like learning how to like boil water

17:10.280 --> 17:15.320
And like make eggs. I learned how to make french toast. My mom taught me how to make french toast

17:16.200 --> 17:19.800
Um, and it was so fun that experience. Um

17:20.840 --> 17:25.480
I burned everything, but you know, you live and you learn, but yeah, I love I love french toast

17:26.120 --> 17:28.120
I love the french

17:28.200 --> 17:29.640
toast

17:29.640 --> 17:32.760
Especially if it's texas toast. I don't know

17:33.640 --> 17:35.640
um

17:35.640 --> 17:39.080
I'm I'm speaking in a very poor french accent

17:40.120 --> 17:44.680
Because I'm half asleep, but um, I am it is how it is

17:46.920 --> 17:48.120
Uh

17:48.120 --> 17:52.440
No, I didn't I can boil water guys. I'm a very good cook

17:54.280 --> 17:58.200
When you're a kid and you're learning you're not a very good cook

18:00.120 --> 18:02.120
It's called eggy bread in england

18:02.440 --> 18:06.200
That's fucking weird. It's not a better name. No, I don't like it

18:07.400 --> 18:09.400
Don't X to doubt

18:09.400 --> 18:17.080
If you've looked at my all account people have commended me on my cooking skills because I have sent I've taken pictures and posted some food

18:17.080 --> 18:18.600
I have cooked

18:18.600 --> 18:20.440
um

18:20.440 --> 18:23.640
French toast is called lost bread and

18:25.800 --> 18:27.800
I feel like there's a pun in there

18:27.880 --> 18:29.880
I

18:30.120 --> 18:35.320
Just found out the healthy frozen protein waffles taste and smell like the ben and jerry's waffle cones. Oh

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
Okay, but what brand?

18:39.240 --> 18:41.640
I do love waffles though. I used to fucking live off of

18:42.520 --> 18:43.880
um

18:43.880 --> 18:49.400
My mom said I used to love french toast sticks and eggo waffles and then out of nostalgia the other day

18:49.480 --> 18:50.840
I bought some

18:50.840 --> 18:54.200
Eggo waffles, but I don't have any syrup or butter. So

18:55.160 --> 18:57.160
I mistakes were made

18:59.240 --> 19:01.800
Waffles versus pancakes. I prefer waffles

19:02.600 --> 19:07.000
Like I love I really like pancakes, but like sometimes pancakes can be a bit too mushy for me

19:07.000 --> 19:14.760
And I like the I prefer the texture of a waffle over a pancake and that like a waffle can hold syrup better

19:15.080 --> 19:17.080
whereas a pancake

19:17.320 --> 19:19.960
Um just becomes kind of just like soppy

19:20.920 --> 19:26.280
I've read french toast sticks. Yeah, it's it's pretty much just like french toast

19:26.840 --> 19:29.080
And you throw it in a toaster and you toast it in there

19:29.640 --> 19:33.240
Or like a con confectionary confection oven or

19:34.120 --> 19:36.120
an oven

19:36.440 --> 19:39.560
My belgian side tell me waffles raw talking

19:41.720 --> 19:44.920
I I have done that before but I prefer like I

19:45.560 --> 19:48.760
I I'm weird and I prefer to eat waffles with my hands

19:49.560 --> 19:51.560
like my mom

19:51.720 --> 19:57.480
For some odd reason because it's not like I was going to impress anybody or have a luncheon with the queen

19:57.960 --> 20:00.440
but she drilled etiquette in like proper

20:01.640 --> 20:02.760
like

20:02.760 --> 20:04.760
Using silverware into me

20:05.320 --> 20:12.200
Like which forks and knives to use which like if you're at this sort of event what this means and what that means

20:13.000 --> 20:14.520
um

20:14.520 --> 20:16.680
I think she just wanted me to be like proper

20:17.320 --> 20:20.840
Which isn't like a bad thing like teaching, you know, your child etiquette and

20:21.800 --> 20:25.320
being you know behaved at the dinner table because I was like I remember

20:26.920 --> 20:28.200
um

20:28.200 --> 20:34.120
I would always have to say like can I be excused before I left the dinner table and I had you know all that stuff

20:34.600 --> 20:38.280
And so I remember like one parent when I was over somebody's house

20:38.600 --> 20:42.120
I would just like can I be excused and they're like why are you asking and I'm like

20:42.680 --> 20:44.680
Because I always have to ask

20:45.400 --> 20:48.840
Yeah, she maybe yeah manners make if she be it's funny. I was literally

20:49.480 --> 20:53.400
I don't know why it popped in my head on the toilet, but I was randomly just sitting there. I'm just like

20:54.200 --> 20:58.760
Manners make if the man that's like I didn't even watch Kingsman reach recently

20:59.240 --> 21:01.400
Actually, that's a lie. I watched the Kingsman

21:02.040 --> 21:04.040
I didn't finish it because it was boring

21:05.560 --> 21:08.120
I got to the part past Rasputin

21:08.840 --> 21:10.840
Rasputin

21:11.080 --> 21:14.520
Poutine that's basically wants poutine now and I was like, all right

21:15.080 --> 21:16.680
This is kind of weird

21:16.680 --> 21:17.960
And it's kind of boring

21:17.960 --> 21:23.800
I prefer the the first Kingsman movies moving on and then I fell asleep and then I just never bothered to watch it again

21:25.160 --> 21:29.000
She'd be getting mad at her friends. I was because they served over over the wrong shoulder

21:30.600 --> 21:38.120
No, like I don't even recall like a lot of that stuff anymore. I remember I went to like um a fancy restaurant with my parents

21:38.920 --> 21:41.800
And this is the type of restaurant where if you get crumbs on the table

21:41.880 --> 21:47.160
They come over and they have a little thing to take the crumbs off and they move them away

21:49.720 --> 21:56.200
And they have like the multiple silverware and it's like that's like a my parents usually go there for their anniversary because it's a very like

21:56.840 --> 21:58.360
pricey place

21:58.360 --> 22:00.680
And I've been like sitting there and I'm like fuck

22:01.480 --> 22:04.040
Which fork do I use for salad again? I don't even

22:05.240 --> 22:07.000
my mom's like

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
That one I'm like, oh, thanks. Anyways

22:22.440 --> 22:24.280
They lived a certain man

22:24.280 --> 22:29.720
It was a long ago. He was being and strong in his eyes a flaming gold

22:31.000 --> 22:35.560
That's the fucking I love doing that and just dance. It's like probably my favorite song to do in just dance

22:36.040 --> 22:38.040
Besides, I think

22:38.360 --> 22:44.520
Was I like that by Richard? Hold on. I like that just dance

22:52.200 --> 22:54.200
By the talk by the

22:55.960 --> 22:58.600
Elect was it the toxic revenge or what the fuck?

23:00.920 --> 23:02.920
Toxic Avenger

23:03.720 --> 23:07.640
Am I tripping I could have sworn I like that

23:09.640 --> 23:12.120
By toxic Avenger was in just dance

23:21.160 --> 23:24.360
I'm getting as toxic from Britney Spears

23:33.080 --> 23:35.080
Very frustrated

23:35.480 --> 23:38.360
Whatever I'm having I'm experiencing a Mandela effect for a moment

23:39.880 --> 23:41.880
It's gonna be saver

23:43.400 --> 23:47.240
I definitely want to like if when they get a 3d model 100 I want to do just dance

23:48.360 --> 23:50.360
I'm like I need to get back

23:50.440 --> 23:51.720
into like

23:51.720 --> 23:53.240
Dance and shape

23:53.240 --> 23:55.240
I'm just like a

23:55.400 --> 23:57.400
I'm just atrophying in my chair

23:57.800 --> 23:59.800
I

24:00.200 --> 24:03.400
Think you had a cool dream toxic Avenger is a movie. No

24:05.160 --> 24:10.520
I think your thumbnail got restricted. Are you fucking serious? I you know, I noticed that when I was on my iPad

24:10.680 --> 24:12.680
I was just like wait a second

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
Why is it like grayed out

24:18.600 --> 24:24.600
Like it was that like the three dots thing I I didn't know what that meant though, but that makes a lot more sense then

24:27.400 --> 24:29.400
I'll fix it later. I blame my manager

24:32.280 --> 24:35.080
They approved the the thumbnail

24:36.680 --> 24:38.680
Throw some boobs in the thumbnail

24:38.920 --> 24:44.120
Put some boobs in the thumbnail bitch for some boobs check out Azura's cover of boobs in the thumbnail

24:47.160 --> 24:51.400
That it was leg but the gray was an artistic choice. It's gray in the homepage

24:52.280 --> 24:54.280
I

24:55.880 --> 25:02.680
Just more reminders that I'm probably never going to be monetized

25:14.360 --> 25:19.560
Sometimes I fall asleep and I hear my bgm in my ears

25:21.480 --> 25:26.680
And is I can't tell if I like it or not

25:32.520 --> 25:34.520
Oh wake up

25:35.000 --> 25:39.880
Oh, I need a non outfit. I was thinking about adding one of those to throw in like one of those, um

25:41.720 --> 25:44.920
Vtuber outfits that I've been using for streams and stuff

25:45.320 --> 25:51.960
I have to get rid of this bod based on what happened with other streamers. Why what happened to their vods?

25:54.840 --> 26:00.920
Wait, I thought everyone got monetized and saying no, that's not true. We applied for monetization all at the same time

26:01.800 --> 26:03.000
um

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
The majority of the other girls got it

26:05.560 --> 26:09.080
I'm still I'm still under review. It doesn't have I'm just I'm

26:09.880 --> 26:14.120
mentally preparing myself to be disappointed in case it happens

26:15.000 --> 26:16.680
Serenity

26:16.680 --> 26:18.680
Munchie be would go so hard

26:20.680 --> 26:23.480
Does she know do they know

26:25.240 --> 26:28.760
It was a priestess and a nun and another another iteration

26:29.800 --> 26:33.000
Uh, sorry, don't you usually stream around this time? What are you doing girl?

26:36.520 --> 26:40.760
Serenity I made you in a call of the lamb and you tried to

26:41.720 --> 26:43.720
Well, like no, you didn't try to kill me. What was it?

26:44.280 --> 26:47.880
You tried spreading falsehoods about my cult so I had a thorium prison

26:47.880 --> 26:50.520
So you're currently in prison right now and call the lamb. I'm so sorry

26:52.920 --> 26:55.560
Rip vod before streaming even started. What do you mean?

26:56.920 --> 26:59.400
YouTube said no to bunny garden of up explain

27:02.120 --> 27:05.080
Is there anything you can do I can reapply in a month

27:05.800 --> 27:07.800
I

27:08.360 --> 27:10.360
That's where I belong in prison

27:11.240 --> 27:13.240
Big lazy

27:13.400 --> 27:16.440
Uh, yeah, it would just it would just be

27:17.560 --> 27:19.800
A month of like I'd have to reapply

27:20.680 --> 27:22.680
Do I have a hat?

27:23.080 --> 27:24.520
No

27:24.520 --> 27:26.520

27:26.680 --> 27:32.360
What's that a hat a crazy funky junkie hat ever slept hair and tidy

27:32.840 --> 27:38.360
Oh, she looks like here at nightly. We've been there. We've done that. We see right through your funky hat

27:40.200 --> 27:42.200
Do you know where that that's from?

27:43.320 --> 27:47.400
I should be fine as long you skip over the in-game asmr. Really?

27:49.720 --> 27:51.720
Why don't I have a hat

27:52.440 --> 27:54.440
Was that from Hannah Montana close?

27:55.480 --> 27:57.000
It's from another

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
another uh show

27:59.480 --> 28:01.480
around that time

28:01.880 --> 28:03.880

The youtube coon will smile upon me and bless me with um

28:18.920 --> 28:20.760
And bless me with

28:20.760 --> 28:22.760
Monetization, but who knows if not

28:23.320 --> 28:25.080
It is what it is

28:25.080 --> 28:28.280
You can always support me on patreon even if you don't want to consume the content

28:28.680 --> 28:34.200
Or you can always support me through stream loads or you can check out my merch. It is not the end of the world

28:36.760 --> 28:38.760
Wizards of Waverly Place you got it

28:40.760 --> 28:44.440
I need to do in your mom hat. That's a pretty good. That's pretty good

28:46.120 --> 28:48.120
I would actually probably get that

28:48.280 --> 28:50.280
somebody said uh

28:51.160 --> 28:53.160
Uh man, I love fishing hat

28:53.400 --> 28:55.400

Pay your tithes every month and just pretend your name is green

29:14.840 --> 29:19.720
No member strips number member strips membership streams though. Um

29:20.280 --> 29:22.280
Well, yeah, I'm not

29:22.440 --> 29:26.440
I'm not too worried. I'm kind of just like doomin about it just like mentally

29:27.960 --> 29:31.480
Because you know, what is that thing that like Wednesday Adam says?

29:33.960 --> 29:38.280
If you expect the worst you can't be disappointed or some shit, but like yeah

29:39.480 --> 29:43.640
member strips member strips is where you get chicken strips sent to you

29:44.200 --> 29:49.160
uh once a month in the mail and the box that they come in has my face stamped at them

29:50.120 --> 29:52.120
But it's like, you know that one

29:52.840 --> 29:54.840
Gif of like a chicken

29:54.840 --> 29:56.840
Pole dancing or it's like a rabbit. I don't know

29:57.240 --> 29:58.680
Just pretend it's a chicken

29:58.680 --> 30:01.880
So it's a chicken pole dancing and that's like my face is on the chicken

30:02.360 --> 30:05.320
And then you get chicken strips from sheebie. That's

30:05.960 --> 30:07.960
Chicken member strips. Yep

30:08.600 --> 30:10.360

Okay

Don't

30:37.720 --> 30:39.320
Worry about me

30:39.320 --> 30:42.120
It's mostly frustrating because I had like I want to do

30:42.920 --> 30:45.320
Like the membership streams that I have in mind

30:46.200 --> 30:47.080
um

30:47.080 --> 30:49.080
My face. No, my face isn't on the strips

30:50.520 --> 30:52.520
It's on

30:52.920 --> 30:55.320
The box that holds the strips unless

30:56.200 --> 30:58.200
You would prefer both

30:58.840 --> 31:00.840
We might do that

31:02.040 --> 31:04.040
Ow, I just like

31:04.040 --> 31:06.040
Hit myself with a nipple really hard

31:07.000 --> 31:09.960
Uh, excuse me. That was a sleepy burp

31:11.800 --> 31:13.800
All right

31:15.960 --> 31:17.960
Go abgm

31:18.520 --> 31:20.520

31:21.000 --> 31:23.480
Bup bup bup bup buddy gordon

31:41.400 --> 31:44.760
Can I be can I be can I be tmi for a second?

31:45.880 --> 31:51.720
So mine are pierced and so sometimes I just get like hooked on stuff

31:57.080 --> 31:59.080
Or I'm just like bump into something like

32:03.480 --> 32:05.480
And that's like the worst thing

32:07.640 --> 32:09.640
I don't

32:10.040 --> 32:13.960
No, no, I'm not ripping them. They're not my nipples aren't getting ripped off guys

32:16.120 --> 32:20.040
It's more it's like imagine

32:21.800 --> 32:24.760
Like if it like, you know

32:25.960 --> 32:28.920
Actually, I don't know if it's like this at all because I don't have balls

32:28.920 --> 32:33.640
But imagine you're going to zip up your pants and like a little bit of your ball gets like caught in the zipper

32:33.640 --> 32:36.040
It's like a little bit. It's like a little less than that

32:37.240 --> 32:39.240
That's what I'm assuming

32:39.960 --> 32:41.960
But imagine that on your chest

32:46.200 --> 32:52.760
Because it's like, you know, like I'm not gonna elaborate. Anyways, I was just fucking loud. Ha

33:00.680 --> 33:02.680
I've had it before it hurts ouch

33:03.240 --> 33:05.400
You get in the hospital when you get caught in your zipper

33:05.720 --> 33:09.000
Well, I'm I didn't mean like if you're caught caught like you can't get out

33:09.000 --> 33:12.280
I mean like when you kind of zip it up and just like pinches you a little bit

34:06.680 --> 34:08.680
Completely mortified like

34:10.920 --> 34:15.640
And then the piercer was telling me so usually the adrenaline kicks in

34:17.240 --> 34:19.800
Only for the first one and then kind of tapers off

34:20.360 --> 34:24.120
For the second one so a lot of people don't get the second one done. I'm like, fuck it. Put the second one through

34:25.160 --> 34:28.520
And they did that and it hurt worse and I was like, ah

And then I couldn't like put anything against my chest for like a month

34:36.120 --> 34:38.280

Vodcon she's a natural. No, it's because so when I first um

01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:15.880
When I finally was able to log into my NSFW. I mean my alternative account

01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:24.120
Um on twitter. I was like trying to go through and there's just like a lot of like fucking like sex bots and I'm like, uh

01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:28.360
Okay, and like the majority of them were

01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:31.480
goddesses and queens and

01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:33.480
mistresses

01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:37.880
And they were all just doing like like had that verbiage and I'm like what the fuck is like I'm like

01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:40.520
Why is this on my timeline? I started just like following like

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.520
anti artists

01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:45.080
To meet your person and then I finally went away

01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:49.480
I'm like fuck this timeline. I don't want these bitches on my timeline

01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:52.680
It's free money

01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:55.720
Yeah, but I don't feel good about it

01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:01.320
Like a tip is different because you're tipping me because you're enjoying my content

01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:04.200
What they're doing is they're

01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:08.520
They're like they're not doing it because they want to

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
assist in

01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:15.640
Trying to say this so that it's

01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:18.040
Okay for you too, but at this point I kind of don't give a fuck

01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:20.760
uh, they don't

01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:22.920
really care about like

01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:25.640
Helping out

01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:27.640
their little piggy, you know

01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:31.560
They just want the money

01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:33.640
they don't care about like the actual like

01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:36.760
relationship of it

01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:39.080
And it's like the respect of it

01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:41.480
because there's

01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:43.480
Yeah, I don't know never mind

01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:49.960
Yeah, they're not really entertainers. It's like like and the girls just like had their fucking feet out

01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:52.760
and they're like

01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:57.640
Send me a tribute of 20 dollars to DM me and I'm like what the fuck is this

01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:02.920
It just I'm sorry just like it generally like irritates me

01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:08.680
But yeah, but then just donate who don't enjoy that but I also think I'm like it's kind of

01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:11.880
It's kind of predatory

01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:16.840
Unless you have a lot of expendable income, you know, but

01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:23.000
I don't judge the people who get pleasure from it. I don't that's fine. You do you

01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:27.240
I'm not a huge fan of the people that take advantage of those people

01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:30.600
That's it

01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:36.760
And those bots are annoying and most of them are fake anyways, so most people are just DMing some random

01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:39.480
cash app of like a dude

01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:42.360
in

01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:44.600
Texas

01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:49.960
Who stole his wife's speed picks and is rinsing out piggies

01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:53.720
Hey, at least I'm in his family could get to disney

01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:04.920
Problem is that some of those men are just having their low impulse control tickets. That's that's what I mean

01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:08.920
That's another point like it's there's that as well 100%

01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:13.960
I would like to youtube money, but I gotta admit it. Yeah

01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:17.400

That's all I say

01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:29.080
A day in white tipped one dollar day in white

01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:33.400
So what you're saying is they want the tip but don't care about the tip

01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:36.920
Exactly

01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:39.320

I

01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:45.160
You know, it's important you don't crush the center. It's the sides of the neck because you're trying to cut off the

The

They appreciate you they care about you, but make sure you pay your bills on time

01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:35.320

Guys are gonna make fun of me and that's okay. I don't mind it because I'm a grown bitch. All right

01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:22.840
If you're gonna call me a bitch you better put sense in it in front of it

Um, but I put on my throne a bed frame because I don't have one

I can spread that sort of love, you know, like uh do like uh charity streams

01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:16.840
I think that would be really cool

01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:21.560
That would be really neat

01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:23.640

So what do you do for a living? I just want to ask those people what they do for a living

01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:15.880
I just buy one big bed frame and combine them

01:23:20.200 --> 01:23:21.000
Crazy

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Saudi imagine like this

01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:29.240
Like a Saudi prince just like really being obsessed with vtubers. That's actually kind of awesome

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
But um

01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:36.600
Like but it's but it's you guys like I I need to

01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:42.600
Make this point to you. It's you guys that keep the vtubing community afloat

01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:47.720
Don't ever forget that without our fan base

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:53.640
There would be no us there would be no vtuber vtubing

01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:56.840
So that's why your support means a lot

01:23:57.720 --> 01:24:02.840
However, you know, there's a fine line just because you do donate does not mean you're entitled to

01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:08.840
Uh all the vtubers attention, etc

01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:13.320
Just yeah

01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:16.360
I don't think I really need to elaborate on that because you are all adults

01:24:17.240 --> 01:24:19.960
Mostly some of you I presume here

01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:26.840
Uh, I'm gonna get rich so I can do the ties right like I like so like

01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:29.800

If I ever blow up and become like a vtuber, fuck you money. I'm just throwing it at other streamers

All I want is a house and I'm good. It's literally it. I want a house and debt-free

01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:52.680
I'm just living with my cats and my chickens and my goats

01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:55.960
And my quail. I've decided I want quail by the way

01:24:56.760 --> 01:24:59.080
And I want to run a rescue and that's it

01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:01.240
That's it

01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:02.920
That's it

01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:08.520
I don't care for fucking fancy cars. I don't wear designer because that's fucking stupid

01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:15.640

Actually, no, that's a lie one time somebody thought I was blazian

01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:32.360
I thought I was mixed because how I like did my makeup and like it was when I was really into k-pop idols

01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:36.200
So I did my makeup like them and it gave me a little bit of like a

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.160
Little blazian look and I was like I look hot as fuck

01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:42.840
But I'm not

01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:21.880
I

01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:24.120
It's because I get distracted

01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:28.360
And I go off on tangents and then I want to elaborate on those tangents

01:29:28.360 --> 01:29:32.600
And then you guys ask me another question and then I get more. It's your fault. It's all I'm gonna say

01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:37.720

01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:48.920
And they were speaking to me in Spanish

01:30:49.800 --> 01:30:51.800
And I'm like, lo siento no habla español

And it's all so hard because I because I worked at my job for so long and we have a very large Spanish speaking population

01:32:29.720 --> 01:32:34.440
Um, I do know quite a bit of Spanish and I can kind of usually follow along to what people are saying

01:32:34.920 --> 01:32:35.960
so

01:32:35.960 --> 01:32:39.720
She would slip into Spanish and I would just respond in English and so she's like

01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:42.600
She looked at me and said you're fucking lying to me

01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:47.960
In Spanish and I'm like, no, I'm not lying to you. She's like, how do you know what I'm saying? And I'm like, I'm

Are you half Chinese? I'm like, no

01:33:58.200 --> 01:34:00.200
All I said was Niho mom

Yeah, who did like they were like big on vine and all that shit

01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:53.480
You know how everybody like tries to guess his race that is how my customers are with me

01:34:55.960 --> 01:34:57.960
Just learn Spanish full of duelingo

01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:01.320
Because I I don't even know what Noel Miller is. I'm like, is he Asian?

01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:04.520
Is he Spanish?

01:35:06.040 --> 01:35:07.960
Is he something else? Is he just white?

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
In the end I'm just a go

01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:16.200
I'm sorry if that breaks your immersion

01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:18.440
I

01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:21.240
Apologize I know some people don't like to hear about this sort of stuff

01:35:21.640 --> 01:35:23.960
But I'm an honest person and I like to talk and I like to yeah

01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:25.480
so

01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:29.400
And then you would have fucking found out anyways when you see my tan ass hand

01:35:31.960 --> 01:35:33.960
On a hand cam stream

01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:40.600
Or my legs on a thigh cam stream. You're like Leonardo DiCaprio point. What the fuck is that?

01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:43.240

Do have bunny ears though

01:35:51.720 --> 01:35:53.720
I genuinely have bunny ears

01:35:54.360 --> 01:35:59.160
Don't don't forget that like I actually have bunny ears. I was born with a deformity. I don't like to talk about it

01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:04.200
I do have bunny ears. Um, I don't have human ears. I just have bunny ears. Yep

01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:13.240
It's fine youtube just tends to add a lighter filter. That's actually true though. Um

01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:19.960
When I was streaming on twitch and I did my first hand cam doing like kind of the cooking popping the popping cooking that like emmy did

I kind of try to ignore it that jessica rabbit is my mom and that she cheated on roger with uh bugs

01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:41.480
Or it's like lola cheated on bugs with roger. I don't know the truth of that

Can you elaborate?

01:47:19.640 --> 01:47:23.640
It just said it just says in the description fresh from the source like what does that mean?

01:47:24.760 --> 01:47:28.920
Sorry, I can't elaborate on the drink menu. You'll have to talk to my superior

01:47:29.880 --> 01:47:33.800
Okay, uh, I guess I'll just have a normal drink then

01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:37.400
What drink did you want?

01:47:38.840 --> 01:47:43.880
Uh, pricey or drink could increase a pricey or drink can increase my likability with the fuck

01:47:47.320 --> 01:47:49.240

Can I I don't have to use my arrows. Where's the sound? Oh my headphones are turned off

01:47:55.320 --> 01:47:57.320
I

01:48:01.960 --> 01:48:03.960
Feel like it if you spend a bag

01:48:05.880 --> 01:48:07.880
Um

01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:11.800
Oh wait, I have to use these which are the most expensive drink on the menu

01:48:14.760 --> 01:48:16.760
Jesus fuck

01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:19.640
You

01:48:23.800 --> 01:48:25.800
Bunny trap

01:48:29.080 --> 01:48:31.080
I'll take the house lemon sour

01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:35.640
Oh, so the emmy nade

01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:37.640
Yeah, whatever

01:48:37.640 --> 01:48:39.640
I want to drink something too

01:48:39.960 --> 01:48:41.960
I have to buy you a drink

01:48:42.120 --> 01:48:44.120
Is this what?

01:48:44.120 --> 01:48:51.160
Like bars are like like some bars are in japan because like I've never been to like a maid cafe or like any of that stuff again. I'm very

01:48:52.200 --> 01:48:54.200
I don't have a sort of thing in america

01:48:56.200 --> 01:49:01.080
Cabaret bars it's a hostess club. Yeah, we don't have those around

01:49:04.360 --> 01:49:10.840
That's really actually I'm like thinking I'm like wait, it'd be a good job. It's like hooters except they buy you drinks

01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:18.760
If you don't drink them to drinks, they will pour what if one of the girls gets fucking shit-faced

01:49:20.760 --> 01:49:23.400
Because if you're like hanging out and drinking with people all the time

01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:29.400
Like if like you have five customers and they just keep buying you drinks

01:49:31.480 --> 01:49:37.560
Like are you limited to like one customer or like what is how does what's the I need an explanation here?

01:49:38.120 --> 01:49:46.520
Actually, yeah, I remember someone said they were like trying to make a vtuber hostess bar that would actually be really fucking cool

01:49:47.240 --> 01:49:49.240
Like do like hologram Miku

01:49:49.400 --> 01:49:51.560
Except make it a vtuber 3d model

01:49:52.440 --> 01:49:57.000
And I will gladly sit and have a drink with you and then I'll probably die because I can't handle. I'll call that will

01:49:57.960 --> 01:49:59.960
um

01:50:01.400 --> 01:50:05.400
I'll buy you some a special highball

01:50:08.440 --> 01:50:11.640
Actually, you're a nice lady. I'm gonna buy you a fine wine

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
Oh, this is great. I love this

01:50:19.480 --> 01:50:22.360
Whoa, uh, hello

01:50:35.320 --> 01:50:37.320
I can zoom

01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:39.960
I

01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:43.960
Can get give them presents holy shit

01:50:45.400 --> 01:50:48.200
So being a host a hostess bar is literally like

01:50:50.280 --> 01:50:55.000
Being a girlfriend in a hoe without the sex and you just got to be nice to people

01:50:57.240 --> 01:50:59.240
I would be so fucking good at that

01:51:00.280 --> 01:51:02.680
Because like I have a very nice and charismatic personality

01:51:03.720 --> 01:51:07.240
Just saying look it. There's a couple of you guys here. Hmm

01:51:07.640 --> 01:51:09.640
It means you like me. He he

01:51:11.960 --> 01:51:13.960

01:51:14.200 --> 01:51:16.200

01:51:18.440 --> 01:51:21.000
Fendom like that. Usually the doms only take they don't give

01:51:22.360 --> 01:51:25.240
Velvet queen tipped 127 dollars

01:51:45.320 --> 01:51:50.440
I'm looking I'm getting panty shots and people are giving me a hundred bucks. What's wrong with it? There's something wrong with this picture

01:51:52.200 --> 01:51:57.080
Thank you. Thank you so much. I'm doing a little heart. I'm doing a little heart little signing. Yay for you

01:51:58.360 --> 01:52:00.840
They bought me a drink. It was a very expensive drink. Thank you

01:52:03.240 --> 01:52:05.240
Uh

01:52:07.880 --> 01:52:09.880
How do I zoom

01:52:14.040 --> 01:52:19.960
I'm like fucking uh, uh, I can't even remember the meme. I just want to zoom

01:52:22.200 --> 01:52:27.400
Uh, it's chat. Did you even tell me your name? I'm getting kind of nervous

01:52:28.440 --> 01:52:31.880
I mean, it's going to be the first time I meet this next customer

01:52:32.360 --> 01:52:33.480
My heart

01:52:33.480 --> 01:52:37.160
You know, I'm right here right like I can hear everything you're saying out lab

01:52:37.320 --> 01:52:42.040
My heart feels like it's going to explode from how fast is racing. Why are you ignoring me?

01:52:43.800 --> 01:52:49.080
Oh, what am I saying? The purpose of this place is to make customers feel relaxed not stressed

01:52:49.960 --> 01:52:53.960
Yeah, but you're stressing me out because you're acting fucking crazy talking to yourself

01:52:54.760 --> 01:53:00.200
If I'm in a state like this, I'm sure the customer is going to feel the same. Come on now. You've got this

01:53:01.160 --> 01:53:03.160
Bitch, what the fuck are you on?

01:53:04.920 --> 01:53:08.680
Sorry, I'm schizophrenic. Okay. Let's start off with the reasonable. Huh?

01:53:09.640 --> 01:53:14.600
The first step in the order is to become friends. You're the customer. So please go right ahead with everything you've got

01:53:16.680 --> 01:53:18.680
You can't see what I'm doing. So I'm taking my arm

01:53:19.320 --> 01:53:23.480
I'm throwing it over my shoulder. I'm throwing it in front of myself like I have a giant cock

01:53:25.800 --> 01:53:27.800
That's my first step

01:53:30.600 --> 01:53:32.600
You like what you see

01:53:37.720 --> 01:53:39.720
Huh

01:53:39.880 --> 01:53:41.880
I mean

01:53:43.720 --> 01:53:46.440
She said hit show me what you got so I showed her what I got

01:53:48.600 --> 01:53:50.600
You know, you're fine. Don't worry about it

01:53:53.640 --> 01:53:56.600
I hurt my elbow. Um, oh my god

01:53:57.560 --> 01:53:59.560
She's my words carefully

01:54:01.320 --> 01:54:03.320
A little bit of hug

01:54:03.720 --> 01:54:07.960
What no hug there's a dude at my job that would do that and I fucking hated him

01:54:09.080 --> 01:54:14.440
He'd be like, where's my hug? I'm like non-existent. I'm sorry. A customer is calling. Bye. Like

01:54:15.080 --> 01:54:17.400
I'm sorry. If you do that to girls, you're fucking annoying

01:54:18.360 --> 01:54:20.360
Where my hug at?

01:54:21.720 --> 01:54:23.720
And then sometimes

01:54:24.600 --> 01:54:28.520
Because like for me so I have OCD and certain like

01:54:29.400 --> 01:54:31.400
feelings and like pressure

01:54:31.640 --> 01:54:33.640
and textures

01:54:33.640 --> 01:54:35.640
Maybe I'm just autistic. Um

01:54:36.440 --> 01:54:42.680
Really bother me. I don't like to be hugged too much unless I really like like you or feel like a really close

01:54:43.560 --> 01:54:46.440
family member or family friend or my parents

01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:49.080
Like I literally will only let like

01:54:49.240 --> 01:54:50.840
Salem and olive

01:54:50.920 --> 01:54:53.320
And my parents hug me and my family members

01:54:55.320 --> 01:54:59.160
Well, like when like because I'll say like people are like really touchy feely

01:54:59.960 --> 01:55:03.240
And like I don't know like I'm just not like that

01:55:04.600 --> 01:55:06.600
um

01:55:06.840 --> 01:55:12.280
Yeah, I'm sorry physical touch is not my love language naturally as a dom. It's it's acts of service

01:55:12.840 --> 01:55:16.040
So get on your knees and eat this kushi kuchi. Um

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
Um

01:55:20.520 --> 01:55:22.520
Madam desires service

01:55:24.600 --> 01:55:29.400
I need a bell. I need a bell to ring. Do I have a bell? I know I have a fucking bell

01:55:31.160 --> 01:55:35.960
Well, it's not a bell actually it's I think it's my candle snuffer

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
Snuffing see where it is

01:55:39.080 --> 01:55:41.080
But it like sounds like a bell

01:55:46.360 --> 01:55:49.480
Oh, it's not dinging

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
Usually makes a ding noise

01:55:55.480 --> 01:55:57.480
Damn it

01:55:57.640 --> 01:55:59.640
Madam requires dick

01:56:00.680 --> 01:56:05.320
Dick act as once just imagine bell noises. Okay. Thank you

01:56:06.280 --> 01:56:08.280
Hmm

01:56:15.240 --> 01:56:18.360
Or kuchi we don't discriminate in this household, okay

01:56:21.640 --> 01:56:23.640
So a toast or something

01:56:24.600 --> 01:56:26.600
So a toast or something

01:56:27.640 --> 01:56:29.640
That's what I just fucking said

01:56:30.440 --> 01:56:36.360
That's the spirit you seem eager to start drinking but don't you think sharing each other's names comes first?

01:56:36.760 --> 01:56:42.280
Well by the little bar that's next to your body. I can kind of surmise your name is kana or kana or

01:56:42.840 --> 01:56:45.880
Can I eat your pussy out tonight?

01:56:46.840 --> 01:56:47.720
What?

01:56:47.720 --> 01:56:49.720
Never mind

01:56:49.960 --> 01:56:52.120
Anyways, I'd love to know more about you

01:56:53.160 --> 01:56:56.760
Right. My name is haito kana. Yeah kanda

01:56:57.720 --> 01:57:03.400
I will butcher butcher japanese names. I apologize to my japanese friends

01:57:06.200 --> 01:57:08.200
The vod staying up

01:57:08.440 --> 01:57:10.440
relax the vod staying up

01:57:11.320 --> 01:57:13.160
relax, oh

01:57:13.160 --> 01:57:18.200
I just remembered because I just see I see someone with ochi marks in their name that aren't mine

01:57:18.440 --> 01:57:21.480
Fuck you first of all, but I don't really blame you because um

01:57:23.080 --> 01:57:25.080
My ochi marks don't work

01:57:25.640 --> 01:57:27.640
on youtube so

01:57:28.040 --> 01:57:31.000
We're gonna do a quick tangent when I say quick. I mean 30 minutes

01:57:32.440 --> 01:57:33.880
um

01:57:33.880 --> 01:57:38.200
I was gonna suggest that we pick some that are youtube friendly

01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:44.840
The shit we're missing every free guy interaction see that um

01:57:47.640 --> 01:57:50.280
Only 30 that's optimistic. Hey, hey

01:57:51.240 --> 01:57:56.920
Slow your fucking roll kid. Okay. Don't disrespect me in my own households

01:57:58.680 --> 01:58:03.880
Arobin, but yeah, but yeah, I know mercies don't like mercies scissors don't work

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:09.320
So I'm your vote is a snail in a tongue

01:58:15.720 --> 01:58:17.800
Yeah, I see yeah polar bear doesn't work

01:58:18.760 --> 01:58:21.960
But like bear and ice cube makes sense that works. Oh

01:58:25.880 --> 01:58:29.880
Since the bunny works I will be bold and suggest the heel and the other bunny

01:58:32.360 --> 01:58:34.360
But the bunny doesn't work

01:58:38.120 --> 01:58:43.480
Is it the bunny face because the bunny like body doesn't work

01:58:47.880 --> 01:58:53.480
But like try to put the because like you know like you look at my um

01:58:55.160 --> 01:59:00.360
Um my old videos I had the rope in the bunny in my title. I might have taken it out actually

01:59:00.760 --> 01:59:02.760
They don't show up. They just show up as squares

01:59:03.640 --> 01:59:07.720
So I think the bunny head would work and then the high-heeled shoe would work

01:59:10.520 --> 01:59:12.520
Bunny twins in an act

01:59:13.960 --> 01:59:15.960
That's just the shining

01:59:17.800 --> 01:59:26.680
No, it was the it was the it's the the bunny with the body and the rope they both don't work

01:59:27.160 --> 01:59:29.160
Is it device to shoot? No

01:59:33.560 --> 01:59:40.520
Because that's the second one you posted nugget isn't an emote actually like a like a normal emo. I don't think

01:59:45.080 --> 01:59:47.080
Okay, here let's let's do this together

01:59:48.760 --> 01:59:51.000
I'll put some in your fucking name then we'll see

01:59:54.280 --> 01:59:57.880
What a fitting game all right now I have to pick them

01:59:59.880 --> 02:00:02.600
Yeah, can you even test the working chat? Yeah, looks like see the working chat

02:00:03.880 --> 02:00:05.880
But if you put them in your name doesn't work

02:00:07.240 --> 02:00:12.360
Oshie mark can just be the membership icon. You mean the gimp bunny? I don't

02:00:12.360 --> 02:00:14.360
No

02:00:17.160 --> 02:00:21.400
No, but no I want Oshie marks. I'm not settling

02:00:23.960 --> 02:00:25.960
A bunny in vomit

02:00:26.600 --> 02:00:31.640
You fall for that a bunny and a knife. I'm not I would say probably a heart and a knife for mercy

02:00:33.640 --> 02:00:35.400
I'm gonna say

02:00:35.400 --> 02:00:39.800
The gunny if you will is there there's only a pistol. I wish I wish they had like this water pistol

02:00:39.800 --> 02:00:41.800
I wish they had the old gun

02:00:42.600 --> 02:00:44.600
I use this account for normal stuff though

02:00:45.560 --> 02:00:47.560
Well, that's too fucking bad

02:00:49.720 --> 02:00:54.920
I'm not changing my Oshie marks like this is the only specific to actually, you know what?

02:00:57.880 --> 02:01:02.680
Until membership's open if you want to show your support and show that you're a harem member

02:01:02.680 --> 02:01:05.080
You can put just the red high-heeled shoe in your name

02:01:05.640 --> 02:01:07.640
So I don't think anybody uses that

02:01:08.040 --> 02:01:10.040
I said yeah, the red high-heeled shoe would be cool

02:01:10.600 --> 02:01:13.560
Because I think there's the red high-heel shoe works

02:01:15.320 --> 02:01:17.640
And then like some bunny doesn't even that can just be anybody

02:01:19.880 --> 02:01:21.880
Yeah, yeah

02:01:25.960 --> 02:01:30.200
Yeah bunny head red heel pig

02:01:32.520 --> 02:01:38.120
Yeah, whatever fucking one works, but just the red heel definitely because that one's obvious

02:01:39.080 --> 02:01:43.960
Some body what's told me a rat

02:01:45.560 --> 02:01:48.200
That would be more in me she got rats

02:01:52.360 --> 02:01:56.360
Yeah, so you can do you can do a heel and whatever your heart desires

02:01:56.760 --> 02:02:01.160
What's an Oshie mark? I like to explain it as imagine. It's a cutie mark

02:02:01.960 --> 02:02:04.120
Of your favorite vtuber, but what's a cutie mark?

02:02:04.200 --> 02:02:08.280
It's a little symbol that shows aspects of the pony's personality

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:16.920
For example twilight sparkle. She's purplish like twilight and there's a sparkler name. So it's like a purply sparkle sparkle on her punch

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:24.280
I've always said that Oshie marks are just cutie marks

02:02:30.280 --> 02:02:32.920
Did you put a red heel in a pregnant man?

02:02:35.080 --> 02:02:38.040
That was good. That was fucking good. They got me

02:02:41.960 --> 02:02:43.960
Hmm so pop rocks to eat

02:02:49.640 --> 02:02:51.640
I'm

02:02:56.200 --> 02:02:58.200
Boomi's looking at me like what the fuck are you doing?

02:03:01.480 --> 02:03:03.480
Good night

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:09.400
No, there's this I think there's a setting just to like put it in your name like your display name

02:03:13.800 --> 02:03:15.800
Only if you want to

02:03:19.880 --> 02:03:23.640
Oh, look at you guys with your bunny heel. Oh, it makes me happy

02:03:26.760 --> 02:03:28.760
Oh my god, that makes me so happy

02:03:29.400 --> 02:03:32.200
I'll I'll add it to my description

02:03:33.240 --> 02:03:35.240
Like if you want to show your support

02:03:36.520 --> 02:03:40.200
Here are the youtube Oshie marks and I'll just put like the bunny in the heel

02:03:41.640 --> 02:03:43.640
He'll in a nose

02:03:45.400 --> 02:03:47.400
Cool

02:03:47.640 --> 02:03:49.640
My day is made

02:03:50.360 --> 02:03:53.000
Bro, I was so productive today. I went to the doctor's office

02:03:53.720 --> 02:03:56.600
I paid some bills. I still haven't done my dishes

02:03:59.480 --> 02:04:03.000
I picked up my mail my packages. I'm streaming

02:04:04.600 --> 02:04:06.600
I got lunch

02:04:09.160 --> 02:04:14.840
I'm feeling good today. I napped for 30 minutes. It was more like 15

02:04:17.480 --> 02:04:19.480
These pop rocks are so fucking good

02:04:20.680 --> 02:04:22.360

The big kids are talking the big kids the adults are talk

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:40.680

Did anyone ask what is that? Oh, nobody asked. That's crazy. Anyways

02:05:02.600 --> 02:05:04.600
I'm more of a writing F

I I didn't know it felt this embarrassing to be stared at. Well, you got massive fucking jugs

02:06:10.760 --> 02:06:12.440
so

02:06:12.440 --> 02:06:15.720
I suppose there's some things you learn from firsthand experience

02:06:16.440 --> 02:06:19.480
Yep, I guess I got a little smarter from this whole situation

02:06:21.160 --> 02:06:25.000
What are you talking about? Well, tell me more about yourself. Hi to come

02:06:27.080 --> 02:06:31.480
I messed up real bad at work recently and because of that the boss fired me

So I've been assisting a friend. It is I wonder what you did for his job. Like, what did he fuck up?

02:06:39.160 --> 02:06:42.520
If you ever knew a compilation of streams this will definitely make it

02:06:43.400 --> 02:06:57.720
It's more like you're not you're cleaning and not making more dirty dishes to clean dishes up. Yeah, it's because like I had dishes and dishwasher

02:06:57.720 --> 02:07:01.480
I still need to take them out and put the other dishes away and then put the new ones in the dishwasher

02:07:04.520 --> 02:07:08.280
So someone's sandwich probably forgot to use MLA format. That's what I'm going with

02:37:39.640 --> 02:37:43.640
Like there's like this one like governor. I think of in america that was a former, um

02:37:44.200 --> 02:37:45.400
It's like a military veteran

02:37:45.480 --> 02:37:48.760
And he wears an eye patch and he looks fucking cool and you can pretend you're solid snake sometimes

02:37:49.400 --> 02:37:51.400
so

02:37:52.600 --> 02:37:54.600
That's good. I hope it goes well

02:37:54.600 --> 02:37:56.200
Thank you for the the tip

02:37:56.200 --> 02:37:58.200
Let me just scratch my nose

02:37:58.840 --> 02:38:05.640
But until recently I was implanted company. However, do you know a plethora of mistakes? I was terminated

02:38:06.360 --> 02:38:08.600
Is there even a word for plethora in japanese?

02:38:09.480 --> 02:38:15.000
Hang on hi tan. I can't keep up with all that formal speech stopping a fucking weirdo

02:38:15.480 --> 02:38:18.280
I'd be super grateful if you could just like talk normally

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:20.600
It's like what is this?

02:38:20.600 --> 02:38:22.600
I'm moving my hands around you can't tell

02:38:23.560 --> 02:38:25.560
Yes, it's called plethora

02:38:26.520 --> 02:38:28.840
Oh really, I'll drop the pretenses then

02:38:29.720 --> 02:38:32.040
Thank you. You're such a nice guy. Hi chum

02:38:32.520 --> 02:38:37.560
Even if you're too formal and weird sometimes it's their loss for firing you you're better off without them

02:38:38.840 --> 02:38:42.760
No, they treated me pretty well, but I'm kidding by okay now

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:45.720
I won the gamble the other day and I did well

02:38:46.600 --> 02:38:52.600
Wow, you're really something hi tan. You don't badmouth them even after getting fired. I respect that

02:38:53.160 --> 02:38:55.160
You know you're for real for real

02:38:55.240 --> 02:38:59.720
No cap facts. No printer ink. What the fuck did you just say?

02:39:00.360 --> 02:39:02.840
You're a stand-up guy. You must get that a lot, huh?

02:39:07.880 --> 02:39:11.160
I don't get that at all they do let me hear some more

02:39:11.400 --> 02:39:15.800
Let me hear some more. I need you to feed can you feed my ego?

02:39:16.520 --> 02:39:18.520
You feed my ego, please

02:39:19.400 --> 02:39:26.120
You're such a kind upstanding person. Hi chan. It's true. I just met you. We've only talked once

02:39:26.440 --> 02:39:31.320
You're really kind of fucking weird, but sure. You know, you are so kind

02:39:31.880 --> 02:39:33.880
in upstanding

02:39:33.960 --> 02:39:35.720
I already said that

02:39:35.720 --> 02:39:39.400
You already said that. Yeah, but you're kind and upstanding. Okay

02:39:40.360 --> 02:39:45.480
Oh, hey, let me tell you something. I'm serious. Well, I'm always serious, but I'm seriously

02:39:46.200 --> 02:39:48.120
serious

02:39:48.120 --> 02:39:50.120
Are you okay?

02:39:50.360 --> 02:39:54.760
Meeting new people is really important right in life. I mean online, you know

02:39:57.960 --> 02:40:00.040
So I'm really grateful to have met you hi chan

02:40:01.160 --> 02:40:05.080
And maybe far from perfect, but I'll still do the very best I can

02:40:05.560 --> 02:40:07.240
Hope you're ready

02:40:07.240 --> 02:40:09.240
I'm gonna sit on your face

02:40:09.400 --> 02:40:10.760
Oh, what?

02:40:10.760 --> 02:40:13.000
Um, sorry. I didn't mean to say that ellipses

02:40:14.600 --> 02:40:17.720
How embarrassing what am I saying sit on your face?

02:40:17.800 --> 02:40:24.040
That was so forward of me. Um, well you get the idea. Did you catch all that? I'm not saying it again

02:40:24.600 --> 02:40:26.600
I'm gonna sit on your face

02:40:26.600 --> 02:40:32.040
By the way, the other girls here will also sit on your face and they're really nice too. I think you'll like this shop a lot

02:40:34.520 --> 02:40:39.240
If you find that I'm not your type after talking to me a few times feel free to slide

02:40:39.400 --> 02:40:42.200
Up to the next row and set or you can have us both at once

02:40:45.880 --> 02:40:49.320
I'm not the type of girl who's bothered by that sort of thing to be you know

02:40:50.840 --> 02:40:53.640
With another girl and a guy I'm I'm bi, you know

02:40:54.360 --> 02:40:55.960
I'm pretty fluid

02:40:55.960 --> 02:40:57.960
I don't believe in labels actually

02:40:58.520 --> 02:41:01.320
Uh, can you can we change the subject fine?

02:41:02.200 --> 02:41:07.000
Well on the other hand if you do find that I'm your type it'd make me pretty happy

02:41:07.240 --> 02:41:09.240
Uh, well, I'll leave it at that

02:41:10.280 --> 02:41:12.840
So like do you want to have a threesome or?

02:41:14.600 --> 02:41:17.640
Uh, I I didn't pay for that kind of service

02:41:18.520 --> 02:41:23.080
It's on the house. Just say fucking yes. I don't think I'm comfortable with that

02:41:24.120 --> 02:41:26.120
I'm sorry

02:41:26.440 --> 02:41:33.560
Um, anyways, I look forward to serving you or whatever. I guess don't fucking threesome with me and the girl in the blue

02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:50.280

02:42:01.800 --> 02:42:03.800

I'm gonna leave my eyebrows

02:42:11.320 --> 02:42:13.320
They'll see you out in a good mood when you leave

02:42:14.040 --> 02:42:16.920
Hito who is sent off is more motivated to work and hat

02:42:17.800 --> 02:42:19.800
What the fuck?

Thank you for today. See you soon

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:31.000
Yeah, thank you for today. So about that threesome. So I'm meeting the other girl like in like an hour

02:43:08.520 --> 02:43:10.520

I'm gonna buy some macarons for the blue black haired girl

02:43:29.160 --> 02:43:31.160
Hmm

02:43:36.840 --> 02:43:41.000
Now it's my time to rest up and recover. This is the only place that can heal my mind

02:43:44.760 --> 02:43:48.920
Oh, fuck it's this bitch again, what? Oh you came thanks

02:43:49.720 --> 02:43:51.160

02:43:51.160 --> 02:43:53.560
Clean up after yourself next time. That's all I'm gonna say

02:43:54.760 --> 02:43:56.760
Um, what drink did you want?

02:43:58.120 --> 02:44:00.120
I don't want to hang out with you

02:44:00.360 --> 02:44:02.280
can I like

02:44:02.280 --> 02:44:06.680
Not buy anything because I don't want to talk to you. I'm gonna get a blueberry liquor

02:44:08.120 --> 02:44:10.120
Because that sounds tasty

02:44:11.160 --> 02:44:15.080
Can I have some too? No, bitch. I want to talk to the girl in blue

02:44:15.080 --> 02:44:17.080
A

Customer called me so I better get going. No one else is fucking here

02:44:25.240 --> 02:44:28.040
I get it. You're embarrassed. I want to talk to the blue girl

02:44:30.920 --> 02:44:34.680
Can I she just fucking walked in place. No, I don't want to talk to you either

02:44:36.360 --> 02:44:38.360
Let me talk to her

02:44:42.120 --> 02:44:44.120
Okay, I'll just get some food

02:44:45.880 --> 02:44:51.080
Oh damn this make me hungry. Maybe eat dinner

02:44:58.680 --> 02:45:03.000
What is a Gio Ailo a Jillo

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:05.000
Oh

02:45:11.640 --> 02:45:17.640

Ha, I'm glad you came back. Thank you. Have you been good?

02:45:35.240 --> 02:45:38.040
Yeah, you seem like you're in a good mood to wrench on

02:45:38.920 --> 02:45:41.960
How do you know my name? I don't oh no, she did introduce herself. Never mind

02:45:42.840 --> 02:45:44.920

02:45:47.720 --> 02:45:48.840
So like

02:45:48.840 --> 02:45:53.320
Is there gonna be an option on the menu where I can eat sushi off your body? Sorry. I hit the microphone

02:45:54.520 --> 02:45:58.200
Um, we don't do that store to service here. This place fucking blows

02:46:00.200 --> 02:46:02.200
Where's my happy ending?

02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:06.120
What good would I be if I couldn't put on a smile? I'm ignoring that

02:46:07.240 --> 02:46:08.360
Hmm

02:46:08.360 --> 02:46:12.280
Yeah, my neighbors are walking by you actually don't look like you're feeling so great yourself

02:46:14.360 --> 02:46:18.280
Really I'm feeling fine physically today and I don't have any problems

02:46:19.560 --> 02:46:23.000
You look shitty. It's all I'm gonna say buddy. Did you shower?

02:46:23.640 --> 02:46:25.640
You smell like you haven't showered

02:46:25.720 --> 02:46:28.760
You sure nope, but you're definitely not feeling good

02:46:29.480 --> 02:46:31.480
Not at all

02:46:31.480 --> 02:46:33.960
This is a bad omen, you know

02:46:33.960 --> 02:46:35.960
Get it today's fortune

02:46:36.840 --> 02:46:41.960
You know would make the the bad omen go away if you buy me a better drink

02:46:43.640 --> 02:46:45.640
Or some sushi

02:46:46.120 --> 02:46:49.800
Or if you have that threesome I keep talking to you about you know, I never mind you smell bad

02:46:50.600 --> 02:46:52.600
Me and girl in blue don't want to fuck you anyways

02:46:52.600 --> 02:46:58.200
When does this she be real-time phantom stream

02:47:00.200 --> 02:47:03.400

But hey, sir, you're lucky. In fact, I can judge based on your name want to try

Oh, fuck. You're one of those numerology astrology bitches. Fuck crazy, bitch. What?

02:47:22.920 --> 02:47:24.360
Sure

02:47:24.360 --> 02:47:26.760
Like fortune telling with names

02:47:27.640 --> 02:47:29.640
Sure, I'll give it a try

02:47:29.960 --> 02:47:34.040
Okay. Okay. Um, I know your name already. You told me what it was last time, right?

02:47:34.920 --> 02:47:37.240
Did you forget my fucking name and you're just

02:47:37.960 --> 02:47:39.960
stalling for me to say it

02:47:41.320 --> 02:47:47.640
Yeah, I introduced myself to you right. I know it. I know it. I know it. Um, but I need to know how it's

02:47:48.280 --> 02:47:51.560
Well, let's see the fortune telling you are so full of shit

02:47:53.560 --> 02:47:55.800
No, I'm not I pooped this morning

02:47:57.640 --> 02:47:59.640
How do you spell your name in kanji?

02:48:04.680 --> 02:48:10.360
I am haito it's con. Why would I just say my last name? Why would you say my filming name?

02:48:11.480 --> 02:48:13.800
I could be an ass and say it's spelled in hiragana

02:48:14.520 --> 02:48:16.520
Uh

02:48:18.040 --> 02:48:20.040
I'll teaser

02:48:20.280 --> 02:48:22.280
I want my birth chart

02:48:22.840 --> 02:48:25.240
Like I don't want us free threesome bra. I'm like

02:48:25.800 --> 02:48:30.280
Uber uncomfortable with that. Oh like I don't want a threesome bra

02:48:30.680 --> 02:48:35.320
I'm like uber uncomfortable with that. I only do threesome with my bros

02:48:36.280 --> 02:48:38.280
We Eiffel tower

02:48:38.840 --> 02:48:40.200
Each other

02:48:40.200 --> 02:48:41.160
Huh?

02:48:41.160 --> 02:48:43.160
Nothing. It's kanda

02:48:44.760 --> 02:48:47.960
Right, but what I want to know is your first name

02:48:48.760 --> 02:48:54.600
I don't think I called you by your first name last time. You literally gave me a female honorific

02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:57.000
because you're a bitch

02:48:57.480 --> 02:49:03.880
First the characters for cup in person then dry in field. That's how you spell haito kanda. Remember now

02:49:05.640 --> 02:49:09.800
You got me, huh? I totally forgot your name. I'm really sorry

02:49:10.760 --> 02:49:12.760
Okay, I found a way online

02:49:13.800 --> 02:49:15.160
I'm one of those

02:49:15.160 --> 02:49:18.840
Oh my god, witch talk is so helpful to learn someone's name after you forget it

02:49:19.480 --> 02:49:22.360
It's said to offer to tell their fortune with it clever, huh?

02:49:23.320 --> 02:49:26.440
But how did you figure it out? Was it acting suspicious?

02:49:29.720 --> 02:49:31.720
These girls are annoying me

02:49:32.680 --> 02:49:38.920
You seem like the type of person who can't tell a lie french hand, but you kind of just technically lied by a mission

02:49:40.120 --> 02:49:42.120
It was written all your face how you were acting

02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:46.360
I get it people usually tell me they can read me like an open book

02:49:48.280 --> 02:49:52.200
I live honestly. It's so tiring to cover up stuff with lies

02:49:53.080 --> 02:49:56.440
It's easier just to be honest and then apologize when you get scolded

02:49:57.720 --> 02:50:03.640
I'm sorry. Hi Chan. You told me your name, but I forgot it and then I tried to pull the wool over your eyes

02:50:04.280 --> 02:50:06.280
I'm really sorry. So, um

02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:09.000
What are you gonna do to make up for it?

02:50:09.880 --> 02:50:11.880
What do you mean?

02:50:12.440 --> 02:50:16.440
I'd like my happy ending, please. I'd like to order one happy ending

02:50:17.400 --> 02:50:19.400
Get on your knees

02:50:19.400 --> 02:50:21.400
Come on

02:50:21.400 --> 02:50:25.000
No, I I I can't we're at work and I I'm asking politely

02:50:26.600 --> 02:50:28.600
I know where you live

02:50:28.600 --> 02:50:31.800
Oh, okay. Can I do it later?

02:50:31.800 --> 02:50:33.800
Fine

02:50:34.120 --> 02:50:36.120
Sorry, I got

02:50:52.200 --> 02:50:56.920
I'm sorry. I forgot where I was. Haido just took over me. I don't even

02:55:02.440 --> 02:55:08.360

02:55:17.960 --> 02:55:19.960

All right, I didn't win that much though

02:55:48.360 --> 02:55:53.800
Okay, if you get the one red glowing eye and white screen you win big

02:55:53.800 --> 02:55:58.040
But if you just get a no glowing eyes and white screen you kind of win a little bit

02:55:59.640 --> 02:56:03.560
But if you get two glowing red eyes you lost badly and if you get

02:56:04.360 --> 02:56:06.360
no glowing red eyes

02:56:06.840 --> 02:56:08.600
Uh

We have medical concerns. I'll be okay

02:58:48.040 --> 02:58:52.520
Um, maybe it's because I really got some time to relax during my time off recently

02:58:53.720 --> 02:58:55.880
You used your days off to the fullest then

02:58:58.120 --> 02:59:00.120

02:59:07.480 --> 02:59:09.720
To this job so I can make money

02:59:10.360 --> 02:59:12.360

02:59:15.880 --> 02:59:21.160
Um, but sometimes going around different stores and looking at what they have makes me feel super excited

02:59:21.960 --> 02:59:23.960

03:00:27.800 --> 03:00:32.920
He loves walks too, so I take him to this really big park near my place whenever I get a day off

03:00:33.400 --> 03:00:35.400
That's what we did last time too

03:00:36.840 --> 03:00:38.840

Time I've talked to you and you're like I need to meet my dog

03:01:33.320 --> 03:01:38.040
Do you think he'd be fine around me though? I wonder if he'll think I was trying to take his master away from him

03:01:39.160 --> 03:01:40.200
because

03:01:40.200 --> 03:01:42.200
I have a question to ask you

03:01:42.760 --> 03:01:44.760
Will you be my master?

03:01:45.880 --> 03:01:47.720
Or my mistress?

03:01:47.720 --> 03:01:49.720

You're trying to seal me away

03:02:04.840 --> 03:02:06.840
Huh, what's wrong?

03:06:31.240 --> 03:06:34.440
Theater attitude is like first. Okay. We'll chat a little bit. I'm gonna give her a present

03:06:36.040 --> 03:06:40.200
Actually, no, I'm not gonna give it her just yet. I'll give her I might extend my time with her

03:06:41.800 --> 03:06:43.800
Because I've talked to them the most the other two girls

03:06:45.400 --> 03:06:47.400
Want to get some food

03:06:47.480 --> 03:06:49.480
Um

03:06:50.520 --> 03:06:52.520
Let's get some whatever the fuck this is

03:06:55.320 --> 03:06:59.880
I love this this is really delicious. I'm feeling all sorts of happiness

03:07:00.920 --> 03:07:02.840
Oh, hello. Nice to meet you

03:07:03.800 --> 03:07:05.800
Would you like to introduce yourself?

03:07:07.000 --> 03:07:10.120
Oh, yeah, you may call me hi to kanda

03:07:11.320 --> 03:07:13.320
Oh

03:07:13.320 --> 03:07:15.320
You don't have to be polite with me

03:07:16.200 --> 03:07:22.280
Oh, I see. I mean, okay. I'm hi to kanda. I helped my friend for work

03:07:23.080 --> 03:07:25.080
I didn't ask that

03:07:25.320 --> 03:07:27.320
You help your friends like

03:07:28.600 --> 03:07:30.600
With a hand job

03:07:31.880 --> 03:07:37.160
Yeah, I was working at a company up until recently but I messed up

03:07:37.800 --> 03:07:39.800
It got fired

03:07:39.880 --> 03:07:41.560
fired

03:07:41.560 --> 03:07:43.560
right

03:07:44.520 --> 03:07:46.520
Are you bad at holding conversation

03:07:48.520 --> 03:07:50.520
Are you person of a few words?

03:07:51.720 --> 03:07:54.520
I guess I don't speak much

03:07:56.120 --> 03:07:58.120
Um hi to

03:07:59.080 --> 03:08:01.080
Why do you sound like a fucking robot? Yeah

03:08:02.200 --> 03:08:05.240
I'm oh, I just spilled apple sauce on my shirt

03:08:08.840 --> 03:08:10.840
It's choked on it

03:08:11.000 --> 03:08:13.320
I always hit my head on my mic. I'm falling apart

03:08:15.880 --> 03:08:17.880
I'm sorry

03:08:18.840 --> 03:08:20.840
You're kind of a loser

03:08:27.400 --> 03:08:29.400
The guy is a charmer

03:08:34.120 --> 03:08:36.120
What does that mean

03:08:36.280 --> 03:08:40.280
I'm sorry. I'm like this. Maybe you won't be able to have a good time

03:08:41.480 --> 03:08:43.480
It's okay. Who knows what will happen

03:08:43.960 --> 03:08:45.960
You can sign my dick

03:08:46.680 --> 03:08:48.680
I could suck your toes

03:08:49.080 --> 03:08:51.080
You can suck my dick

03:08:51.240 --> 03:08:53.240
Just met each other

03:08:53.240 --> 03:08:55.240
So my dick

03:08:55.400 --> 03:09:00.520
I think would be nice if you could suck my dick. Just take things slow, you know first base

03:09:01.560 --> 03:09:03.160
Sucking my dick

03:09:03.160 --> 03:09:04.680
No rush

03:09:04.680 --> 03:09:06.680
We already started to get to know each other

03:09:07.480 --> 03:09:09.480
Oh

03:09:09.480 --> 03:09:11.240
Thank you

03:09:11.240 --> 03:09:13.240
You're kind one. Hi, though

03:09:13.720 --> 03:09:15.720
Do you want some alcohol?

03:09:16.360 --> 03:09:18.920
What should I do? Is there anything I should prepare?

03:09:20.280 --> 03:09:22.280
Yeah

03:09:22.840 --> 03:09:27.480
My efforts have been rewarded. I want to drink something delicious

03:09:29.240 --> 03:09:35.160
What drink did you want? I'm giving her like several different voices. I'm so sorry. I'm buying you

03:09:36.840 --> 03:09:38.840
I don't have enough money. Uh

03:09:40.200 --> 03:09:42.600
Well, okay, what drink do I want so I will have

03:09:43.880 --> 03:09:45.400
I'll just have a beer

03:09:45.400 --> 03:09:50.520
Where's the beer the fuck is the beer? I'll have a beer. I don't know why we have it in these glasses, but

03:09:52.360 --> 03:09:54.360
Can I have a drink with you?

03:09:54.520 --> 03:09:59.320
Yes, my beautiful princess. I'm gonna get you a bunny punch

03:10:01.720 --> 03:10:04.680
Because I'm gonna punch my dick into your womb and fill you with children

03:10:07.320 --> 03:10:09.320
I like that. All right

03:10:13.320 --> 03:10:16.360
What that's it I expected more

03:10:19.160 --> 03:10:21.160
Deep the deep Riz

03:10:21.800 --> 03:10:23.800
S to your Riz. Thank you

03:10:24.600 --> 03:10:26.600
Okay, I have a present for you

03:10:30.040 --> 03:10:34.520
If it's okay, would you be willing to accept this? I hope you like it

03:10:35.320 --> 03:10:37.320
It smells like my mom

03:10:39.880 --> 03:10:41.880
What don't worry about it

03:10:44.920 --> 03:10:46.920
Okay, thanks

03:10:47.240 --> 03:10:49.240
We have to take care of it

03:10:49.480 --> 03:10:51.320
Take care of what?

03:10:51.320 --> 03:10:52.520
Your dick

03:10:52.520 --> 03:10:54.360
Huh?

03:10:54.360 --> 03:10:56.360
What?

03:10:58.520 --> 03:11:00.520
I keep doing double takes to see if this is the time

03:11:05.480 --> 03:11:07.480
Oh

03:11:07.880 --> 03:11:12.120
Why are they just staring at each other and quiet? Oh my god

03:11:14.520 --> 03:11:17.800
Wait, wait, you buy a drink for the bartenders. Yes. Yes, you do

03:11:20.600 --> 03:11:23.000
This is this is this is a good stream today

03:11:25.560 --> 03:11:32.760
Is there anything you want to talk about? Yeah, uh, you think tomorrow be sunny or whatever

03:11:35.480 --> 03:11:38.280
Um, there's a monsoon raging outside

03:11:41.080 --> 03:11:47.960
I have no idea. I have no idea. I have no idea. I have no idea. I have no idea

03:11:49.800 --> 03:11:51.800
Sorry

03:11:53.800 --> 03:11:56.840
Buy a drink for the bartender to take a small sip and throw it into the plants. Oh, yeah

03:11:57.480 --> 03:11:59.800
But like how do they pace themselves? You have to have like

03:12:00.600 --> 03:12:01.640
quite

03:12:01.720 --> 03:12:05.640
Like you have to be able to handle your liquor if you're serving patrons from let's say like

03:12:06.760 --> 03:12:08.760
Let's say your shift is like five hours

03:12:09.960 --> 03:12:11.960
And maybe you hang out with a guy for each hour

03:12:12.200 --> 03:12:16.520
Like how many people are buying you more drinks? Is this happening? Like I need to know the schematics

03:12:17.640 --> 03:12:19.640
Goofy

03:12:21.800 --> 03:12:23.800
Do they really only take one sip?

03:12:24.760 --> 03:12:25.960
I

03:12:25.960 --> 03:12:32.520
Are all they're pretty good. No, like legit like tell me the tea is the tea piping hot cuz spill it

03:12:34.760 --> 03:12:37.960
You don't drink with every patron. Okay. Do they actually puke constantly?

03:12:38.920 --> 03:12:42.760
This is the equivalent of the ghost anime top. I love that fucking dumbest hilarious

03:12:44.120 --> 03:12:47.880
It's basically they're tipping they mix it for themselves. They probably don't mix. Oh

03:12:47.880 --> 03:12:54.040
Oh, that's true. I because I had a friend actually I don't had a friend. She does this currently olive

03:12:54.280 --> 03:12:58.840
She bartends and she tells me sometimes customers try to buy her a drink and she just literally gives herself

03:12:59.320 --> 03:13:01.960
Like a sprite and says it's a gin and tonic

03:13:03.880 --> 03:13:05.880
Yeah, or they mix the drink of water

03:13:06.680 --> 03:13:09.240
Excuse me hostess. Will you bear my children?

03:13:11.240 --> 03:13:14.520
Like there is a job somewhere in the world that you just get paid to drink that's basis

03:13:14.680 --> 03:13:17.000
That's kind of cool like that. Like I'm like hostess job

03:13:17.720 --> 03:13:19.720
That's not bad

03:13:19.720 --> 03:13:21.320
Like does it pay well?

03:13:21.320 --> 03:13:23.000
you know

03:13:23.000 --> 03:13:26.200
Shall we look up the weather forecast because we're fucking nerds

03:13:27.560 --> 03:13:29.560
Are you always curious about the weather?

03:13:31.320 --> 03:13:37.720
I just want to know how wet you're gonna be tomorrow. Uh, no, not really. I'm just making small talk

03:13:40.680 --> 03:13:43.480
Oh, sorry, I didn't mean anything by that

03:13:44.680 --> 03:13:48.280
This is who I am all the time. Is that okay with you?

03:13:49.480 --> 03:13:51.480
Can you please marry me?

03:13:52.520 --> 03:13:56.680
It's all right with me. So please marry me. I'm on my knees. Please. I'm begging

03:13:57.560 --> 03:13:59.880
We're just starting to get into each other, but you're my life

03:14:01.800 --> 03:14:03.800
You're a peculiar one

03:14:03.880 --> 03:14:05.640
please

03:14:05.640 --> 03:14:10.840
You laughed just now. Didn't you that means you should marry me? I also know where you live. I know where all the girls here live

03:14:10.840 --> 03:14:12.840
Okay

03:14:13.880 --> 03:14:16.520
You have a cute smile, especially when you're sleeping

03:14:17.480 --> 03:14:18.520
What?

03:14:18.520 --> 03:14:20.040
anyways

03:14:20.040 --> 03:14:21.720
Oh

03:14:21.720 --> 03:14:23.400
Thanks

03:14:23.400 --> 03:14:27.640
What will you do? Are you still going to drink? Should I prepare some more alcohol?

03:14:28.520 --> 03:14:30.280
Yeah

03:14:30.280 --> 03:14:32.520
Thank you. It means you'll still be with me

03:14:33.560 --> 03:14:35.560
What drink did you want?

03:14:35.640 --> 03:14:38.840
Uh, can I get like absolutely black? Oh, I can only have three drinks. Okay

03:14:39.160 --> 03:14:41.160
Um

03:14:42.920 --> 03:14:45.720
I'll have some wine for chip. We're hanging out

03:14:49.560 --> 03:14:53.480
Beer before liquor never been sicker liquor before beer you're in the clear

03:14:55.160 --> 03:14:58.680
Can I have a drink with you? Of course you can girly pop

03:14:59.640 --> 03:15:01.640
Only the best for my queen

03:15:02.120 --> 03:15:04.120
Only the best for my queen

03:15:05.240 --> 03:15:07.240
I'm so happy. I'll get the bottle

03:15:08.840 --> 03:15:10.840
Oh

03:15:14.200 --> 03:15:17.640
Oh, I got enough cash. Yeah, I got fucking enough cash

03:15:21.320 --> 03:15:24.760
You're by the 50k you had bought all that ending. Let's chat

03:15:28.600 --> 03:15:31.880
Are you having fun? She looks so fucking pissed off right now

03:15:33.560 --> 03:15:38.520
Yeah, why are you looking at me like that? No, I think I'm enjoying myself. Please stop looking at me like that

03:15:39.240 --> 03:15:41.240
Good. Well, that's nice

03:15:42.200 --> 03:15:44.600
Muka Chen, are you enjoying yourself?

03:15:46.520 --> 03:15:52.360
Still undecided. You kind of smell bad. I would rather be hanging out with the people over there

03:15:53.640 --> 03:15:56.840
They actually buy me the 50k and bottle

03:15:58.040 --> 03:16:00.040
But it's whatever

03:16:01.240 --> 03:16:03.240
I don't exactly hate it

03:16:03.240 --> 03:16:07.240
Why don't you hate it?

03:16:09.960 --> 03:16:11.960
Is that it? I don't even know why I asked that

03:16:12.520 --> 03:16:14.520
She's looking at us like we're garbage

03:16:15.000 --> 03:16:18.120
You kind of gross me out and you kind of disgust me

03:16:19.560 --> 03:16:24.520
I would rather not hang out with trash like you, but I need to pay the bills

03:16:25.400 --> 03:16:27.400
So here I am

03:16:29.960 --> 03:16:31.960
I don't know

03:16:33.640 --> 03:16:35.400
I wonder why

03:16:35.400 --> 03:16:36.920
um

03:16:36.920 --> 03:16:38.680
Huh

03:16:38.680 --> 03:16:44.520
I don't believe you. Hi, though. Are you really enjoying it? Why are these girls gaslighting me?

03:16:46.200 --> 03:16:48.680
They literally like I'm fine and they're like you're not okay

03:16:49.480 --> 03:16:51.480
Tell me what's wrong

03:16:51.480 --> 03:16:53.480
Give me your money

03:16:53.880 --> 03:16:55.800
And buy me a drink

03:16:55.800 --> 03:16:58.120
And I'll pretend to cheer you up. So when you come here

03:16:58.760 --> 03:17:02.440
You think you're getting you're think you're getting serotonin and dopamine from only me

03:17:02.680 --> 03:17:06.200
So then you have to come and then you have to spend more money to feel like you're okay

03:17:06.440 --> 03:17:11.160
Because you need me to tell you when you're okay or not. This is toxic as hell

03:17:17.240 --> 03:17:20.440
This is a scyop. This is a fucking scyop

03:17:23.000 --> 03:17:25.400
Just I don't know how but it is

03:17:28.680 --> 03:17:33.320
Haha, it's okay. You don't have to worry about me

03:17:35.080 --> 03:17:37.080
I worry though. You're my customer

03:17:38.040 --> 03:17:40.040
You must have a good time

03:17:40.440 --> 03:17:42.440
You must have a good time

03:17:43.400 --> 03:17:45.400
Okay, is she an android?

03:17:47.240 --> 03:17:53.080
I don't know man. Okay, just just checking. Uh, well everyone enjoys themselves in their own way

03:17:53.080 --> 03:18:01.800
Hmm, I'm not enjoying this. I wish I was doing something else. You're so odd. Did you know that?

03:18:02.920 --> 03:18:04.920
Haha, yeah, I know

03:18:06.840 --> 03:18:08.840
It's whatever

03:18:09.160 --> 03:18:12.520
I don't exactly hate it. I hate you

03:18:13.480 --> 03:18:15.480
You're not worth my time

03:18:17.160 --> 03:18:21.480
Oh, uh, it's getting late. I should go home soon. Yeah, you should

03:18:23.400 --> 03:18:25.400
Shit, there's a lot of money

03:18:26.840 --> 03:18:33.560
See you. I'll be waiting. I just wanted to step on me. Yeah, thanks for everything. Uh, see you soon

03:18:37.960 --> 03:18:44.040
Statement it did good times. We had a good conversation. I'm looking forward to going to work now

03:18:46.360 --> 03:18:48.360
I don't want to go back there again

03:18:49.320 --> 03:18:51.320

03:26:04.920 --> 03:26:06.280
I

03:26:06.280 --> 03:26:10.520
Broke time to get the cardboard box. I happen to be deficit and funny. I feel like the game just ends

03:26:12.040 --> 03:26:14.600
That's not what I meant. I really am interested

03:26:15.240 --> 03:26:17.240

It doesn't even hurt my pictures. It's so funny that it acts. It's actually a little embarrassing

03:26:49.960 --> 03:26:53.480
Thank thanks though those pictures are so embarrassed sometimes

03:26:53.800 --> 03:26:57.160
What freaks me out is the dialogue that I'm dubbing and making up

03:26:57.800 --> 03:27:02.360
Makes sense for their responses. She's like it's so embarrassing like as if

03:27:03.000 --> 03:27:04.840
as if he um

03:27:04.840 --> 03:27:07.400
As if she like that was an actual fucking line

03:27:09.800 --> 03:27:11.800
It's so funny

03:27:14.280 --> 03:27:15.400

Go out shopping for clothes. Sorry. Go out shopping for clothes and stuff

03:27:33.160 --> 03:27:36.120
Too bad. I'd like to shop, but I have no money

03:27:37.240 --> 03:27:42.760
Wow, she's me for real for real. So that's why I whore myself out in this buddy garden

03:27:43.720 --> 03:27:51.400
Please can you please take the offer for the threesome? I'm giving you a discount. It's only $150

03:27:52.120 --> 03:27:57.640
Most of the time it's 300 you get two for the price of one. Okay

03:27:58.760 --> 03:28:00.760
I'm not interested

03:28:00.840 --> 03:28:02.040
Whatever

03:28:02.040 --> 03:28:05.400
I went to shop and wait until I find something I really want

03:28:06.120 --> 03:28:08.120
Then I buy it

03:28:08.760 --> 03:28:10.760

I went to karaoke in front of the station by myself last weekend

03:28:18.520 --> 03:28:23.160
I sang nothing but the songs I wanted to sing myself doesn't everybody fucking do that

03:28:25.000 --> 03:28:29.000
I guess you try to pick songs that everyone knows when you go with friends

03:28:31.000 --> 03:28:37.480
That oh that t-dos came back up. Oh, then I mentioned it get as a reflux when I have vodka

03:28:40.200 --> 03:28:43.880
Yeah, I like hearing people sing so going with friends is fun too

03:28:44.280 --> 03:28:48.840
Mostly I just go by myself because my friends are in my head. They're TALPAs

03:28:51.320 --> 03:28:53.320
Shut up, Jeff

03:28:53.560 --> 03:28:55.800

Obviously not. I don't even know anyone who'd want to I'm a fucking loser

03:29:18.520 --> 03:29:23.240

03:29:23.720 --> 03:29:25.400
four or three some

03:29:25.400 --> 03:29:26.920

03:31:06.600 --> 03:31:08.600
I

03:31:08.920 --> 03:31:10.920
When you try to gamble with a low amount

03:31:13.480 --> 03:31:17.720
Open the window and a breeze rolls in and I cheers in my pads

03:31:19.080 --> 03:31:22.120
It's barely enough for the bill. I was fine. Oh

03:31:23.320 --> 03:31:25.320
See it doesn't do that much

03:31:26.040 --> 03:31:28.200
300 yen is about like fucking five bucks

03:31:29.800 --> 03:31:32.840
And I went like 50 kn because I'd be sick

03:31:36.520 --> 03:31:38.520

Oh, wait, I realized that I could have gotten like a make-up set. It's fine. Uh, then we're gonna save

03:31:59.000 --> 03:32:01.000
And

03:32:05.080 --> 03:32:07.080
Then we're gonna gamble

I'll probably play hoony pop and I'll probably do a similar thing to this where I voice all the characters

03:48:41.080 --> 03:48:43.880
And we get all the fun special stuff. So

03:48:44.920 --> 03:48:46.520
Yeah

03:48:46.520 --> 03:48:48.520
Brilliant segue. Thank you

03:48:48.920 --> 03:48:50.920
Thank you. Thank you

03:48:51.080 --> 03:48:55.160
Yes, nice. Oh very nice. Yes. Oh, yeah, silly fans. Yeah

03:48:58.200 --> 03:49:00.600
Sounds like a peak lee stream. Yes

03:49:01.640 --> 03:49:03.640
Do you feel any pop might kill me?

03:49:05.800 --> 03:49:08.440
Yes, I've been here for the longest out of all the cast members

03:49:10.440 --> 03:49:12.280
See, I told you

03:49:12.280 --> 03:49:17.160
She's a she's not she's a trust fund, baby. She also lives on our parents life insurance

03:49:17.800 --> 03:49:19.640
That's that's a lore

03:49:19.640 --> 03:49:22.200
Surprised she just comes here for fun to insult people

03:49:23.480 --> 03:49:25.080
What's the issue?

03:49:25.080 --> 03:49:27.080
Because of the way I am

03:49:27.400 --> 03:49:32.120
Is it because you're not good at making small talk and you're bad at serving customers?

03:49:34.840 --> 03:49:37.240
Dude what the fuck you have to say that

03:49:41.240 --> 03:49:44.760
Yeah, how have you been here so long? You're just shit at talking to people

03:49:45.800 --> 03:49:49.000
But you're an idiot. I hate you. Don't ever come again

03:49:50.440 --> 03:49:52.840
So that's how you prove what the fuck just happened

03:50:00.600 --> 03:50:06.840
So that's how you perceive me. No, no, I'm sorry. That's not what I think of you at all. Although I said it out loud

03:50:06.840 --> 03:50:13.960
And it wasn't even like a dub from the person voicing me right now. I'm just a dick

03:50:15.720 --> 03:50:17.720
That's okay. You're right anyway

03:50:20.040 --> 03:50:23.720
He he oh were you just messing with me?

03:50:25.000 --> 03:50:27.000
Because it was kind of hot

03:50:27.320 --> 03:50:29.320
Tell me you hate me some more

03:50:29.880 --> 03:50:32.680
Yes, I was teasing you but I actually do hate you

03:50:33.560 --> 03:50:35.560
Fuck you

03:50:37.160 --> 03:50:40.840
Do you want some alcohol? What should I do? Is there anything I should prepare?

03:50:41.720 --> 03:50:43.480
Uh, yeah

03:50:43.480 --> 03:50:47.000
My efforts have been rewarded. I want to drink something delicious

03:50:47.960 --> 03:50:50.760
What drink did you want? Um, I would like

03:50:52.520 --> 03:50:54.520
A woman's sour

03:50:54.520 --> 03:50:56.520
a highball

03:50:56.760 --> 03:50:58.760
Actually, yeah

03:51:01.000 --> 03:51:04.920
We got money I can't take a picture. I don't think I can take a picture

03:51:05.880 --> 03:51:07.880
How do I take pictures?

03:51:09.000 --> 03:51:11.800
Can I have a drink with you? Of course my princess

03:51:13.000 --> 03:51:15.000
You can have whatever you want. Wait

03:51:19.800 --> 03:51:22.680

03:51:35.880 --> 03:51:37.880

03:51:39.000 --> 03:51:42.360
Okay, how how how how do I take a picture how no

03:51:45.480 --> 03:51:49.960
Don't don't press the right key. Don't press the right. Don't press right click

03:51:51.400 --> 03:51:53.400
That's all I'm gonna say

03:51:53.720 --> 03:51:55.720
Just fuck that out for me

03:51:55.960 --> 03:51:58.360
Um, here's another president. Oh fuck

03:51:59.560 --> 03:52:01.560
Uh, I'll just chat with you

03:52:02.520 --> 03:52:06.520
Oh boy whore arc let's go. Do you have friends? No

03:52:07.800 --> 03:52:09.800
It's not like you have any friends either

03:52:10.680 --> 03:52:15.160
Uh, yeah, I do the work I'm doing is all through a connection with my friend

03:52:15.960 --> 03:52:18.520
That my parents totally didn't pay to be friends with me

03:52:19.720 --> 03:52:23.880
You do have friends. That's unexpected. You kind of seem like a loser

03:52:24.840 --> 03:52:26.040
Damn

03:52:26.040 --> 03:52:27.880
You have to be so harsh

03:52:27.880 --> 03:52:29.880
Why is that so surprising?

03:52:30.280 --> 03:52:37.880
You're the type of guy who gets fired. I figured might make a mess with friendships as well. Jesus. Why is she cooking me?

03:52:45.000 --> 03:52:47.000
I'm like I feel personally attacked

03:52:49.000 --> 03:52:51.880
But it makes sense because all you guys are fucking subs and she's a fucking

03:52:52.360 --> 03:52:56.600
She's fucking insulting. You know, you're all getting off on it. Yeah, I bet you fucking like it

03:52:57.000 --> 03:53:01.000
Go wash your pants. Go change your pants and your unnies and wash your fucking hands. You freak

03:53:01.800 --> 03:53:03.800

I'm pointing at my camera. By the way. I'm gesturing very heavily at you now

03:53:08.840 --> 03:53:10.840

03:53:13.480 --> 03:53:16.040
Do you have any friends mucachan?

03:53:17.480 --> 03:53:19.480

Everybody calls me everything besides my own name

03:57:20.920 --> 03:57:24.040
Dubbing was too hilarious. I wish you could do more jobs like this. Oh, yeah

Great stream. Thank you. Thank you

03:57:33.560 --> 03:57:35.560
Here's another kind of bad

03:57:35.640 --> 03:57:37.800
Restella acting made the stream amazing

03:57:38.840 --> 03:57:40.840
I'm something of an actor myself

03:57:43.400 --> 03:57:45.400

Do they allow who you pop on youtube? Uh, they actually do they allowed like when you do like the censored version

03:57:53.800 --> 03:57:55.720
But I could play

03:57:55.720 --> 03:57:57.720
the uncensored version on

03:57:57.880 --> 03:57:59.880
The Lee's fan site

Like all those years ago that is when I bought it and I have not touched it since I bought it

03:58:43.080 --> 03:58:45.080
I've never played the game

03:58:48.280 --> 03:58:50.280
I don't even know why the fuck it never did

03:58:51.720 --> 03:58:53.720
I think I was like meaning to play it

03:58:54.440 --> 03:58:56.440
a couple of times

03:58:56.760 --> 03:58:59.240
Oh my god, I just looked outside and the way the sun is setting

03:58:59.320 --> 03:59:04.280
I thought a building was on fire because the way it's reflecting. Holy shit. That was I was like, what?

03:59:06.760 --> 03:59:10.440
But yeah, really I'm very happy you guys enjoyed that was really fucking fun

04:02:32.440 --> 04:02:38.600
Our Azura's chat and she's like we didn't get this lady a toaster ASAP because like can we just talk about how she baked her toast?

04:02:40.440 --> 04:02:42.600

04:02:58.440 --> 04:03:00.440
Burn her house down

04:03:00.440 --> 04:03:02.440

04:03:06.440 --> 04:03:08.440

I feel like if I go and I read somebody else then she's gonna suddenly be there

04:03:15.640 --> 04:03:18.440
