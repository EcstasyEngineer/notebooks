225120	229120	I fell asleep from ICStream, I did. I fell asleep to her ASMR.
229120	234120	I woke up momentarily because her redirect was strawny.
234120	239120	So I heard strawny's voice for a couple seconds and I took off my headphones because she was like...
249120	251120	I need to wake up.
252120	254120	I need to wake up.
255120	257120	I need to wake up.
260120	264120	My cats also are eating in the background.
269120	272120	I'll pretend that I don't hear anything.
275120	277120	Thank you.
279120	281120	You have with you to wake up.
281120	283120	I'll pretend that I don't hear anything.
311120	313120	I'll pretend that I don't hear anything.
341120	343120	I'll pretend that I don't hear anything.
371120	373120	Here is my donation of virginity.
375120	377120	Oh, I can hear myself.
377120	379120	Oh no, fuck.
379120	382120	Gross, gross, gross, I hate that.
383120	387120	It's because I went and after the last stream,
387120	390120	I tried fixing my microphone again.
390120	393120	But I guess it's still not good enough.
393120	396120	Alas, I give up.
397120	399120	I like...
399120	404120	Am I going to have to like get strawny in here or something?
404120	407120	Are we going to bring double sheebie?
407120	408120	No, no double sheebie.
408120	409120	Oh, Reina's here.
409120	410120	Hello, Reina.
410120	411120	What's up?
411120	415120	Oh, let me move my headphones so you can lay in your bed.
416120	418120	And Fia must be munching.
418120	422120	Oh my gosh, please don't knock over my drink on my own keyboard.
423120	429120	I usually just throw my headphones above my mic arm.
430120	434120	I'm not hearing double sheebie ads because I shut myself up real quick.
434120	437120	Because I was like, why is my desktop audio going crazy?
437120	442120	And I realized my thing was unmuted because I had been listening to myself,
442120	447120	fighting with my lovely AT2020 that I've had for over a decade.
447120	450120	You're the best microphone ever, baby girl.
451120	454120	But yeah, double sounds twice as good.
454120	458120	I remember my ASMR stream, I was double for like half the stream
458120	461120	and everybody was like, yeah, it was actually sounded okay.
461120	463120	And I'm like, what the fuck?
469120	471120	Reina, are you waking up?
471120	475120	Reina, I was also almost late because Reina was coughing up her ball.
475120	477120	My poor old lady.
478120	480120	Now she came out to snuggle with me.
480120	482120	So I was like watching her.
482120	484120	And then I'm like, oh fuck, I have to pee.
484120	486120	And I'm like, lady, are you okay?
486120	489120	And then I'm like, oh, oh.
490120	494120	Imagine having an ass in an AT2020 mic as opposed to a shirt.
494120	496120	Okay.
498120	500120	They cut, I thought it was fine.
500120	504120	Although what, do you want me to throw a shirt on my, my throne?
504120	507120	Do you want you guys want to drop $400?
507120	509120	Sure, go for it.
509120	511120	I don't think that'll fix my audio.
511120	515120	It's definitely more of a, what's it called?
515120	517120	Settings thing.
517120	519120	Because my AT2020 is fine.
519120	521120	I see only pokes fun at you.
521120	523120	I haven't heard a poke phone at the others yet.
523120	527120	It's because I, you said I have nice reactions.
527120	531120	And they are the only ones that I will allow that tease me, my girls,
531120	533120	because nobody else can tease me.
533120	534120	Or you will get caught.
534120	537120	I will come to your house and something will go up your butt.
537120	539120	It's not going to be nice.
539120	542120	It's probably going to go out of your mouth and then you'll pass away.
542120	544120	Haha, no, it's fine though.
544120	547120	I think your levels had steam percent to be fine for the mother should be cool.
547120	549120	Nice promise.
549120	551120	Yes.
551120	554120	Pinky swear promise.
557120	560120	Don't shame others of using other mics on the processing.
561120	563120	I could, you know, I could just be like,
563120	567120	for the first like month of being in calls with strongy,
567120	569120	she just had this gamer microphone.
569120	571120	She sounded like fucking Tyler one.
572120	574120	And I was funny as hell.
574120	576120	It was so good.
576120	578120	Yeah, keep you in line.
578120	579120	I don't know where my crop is.
579120	580120	It's behind me.
580120	581120	I feel like reaching for it.
581120	583120	Because I'm raining on my arms.
583120	586120	Oh, hey, fancy meeting you again so soon.
586120	588120	Oh, hello.
589120	592120	Scots is from Tyler one.

599120	602120	that I use for like the cat cam and hand cams and stuff.
602120	605120	And then I've had my 80 2020 for such a long time.
605120	607120	Those are the only things that have not broken on me.
607120	610120	Everything else broken.
611120	614120	Like my I had like my favorite.
614120	617120	I forget what the mouse is called.
617120	620120	Let me see if I can pick it up with my feet because it's just on the floor.

626120	629120	It's a I love this mouse.
629120	630120	It's a large attack.
630120	632120	I can't see it.
632120	635120	Does it have the number on it?
635120	636120	I don't know.
636120	638120	It's the one that shroud uses.
638120	641120	I had just the regular one before that and the prices shot up on them
641120	645120	because shroud whatever was using it or someone else.
646120	648120	Yeah, it's audio technica.
648120	649120	Yeah, it's audio technica.
649120	653120	And I asked him starting talking to Xbox controller microphone.
654120	655120	Feet mouse.
655120	659120	Yeah, I don't know if you guys heard that lovely ASMR if my microphone picked it up.
662120	666120	I was so mad at like all the ones I got of that Logitech mouse
666120	672120	just that one of the keys gets sticky like my right click gets sticky.
672120	675120	And I was I took it apart to clean it and there's nothing wrong with it.
675120	678120	And this is like just gets fucked up.
678120	682120	And I asked the person, oh, is it like ghost clicking or double clicking
682120	683120	because it would do that too.
683120	686120	And they're like, no, when I bought off eBay and I'm like, fuck you guys.

786120	787120	So it's cool.
787120	789120	I remember the first time someone ever donated to me.
789120	792120	I cried so hard.
792120	794120	I would ever get how old I was.
794120	796120	And I think I was like 18.
796120	798120	Streaming on Twitch.
798120	801120	And I was streaming to like seven people.
801120	803120	Like Counter Strike.
804120	807120	And my setup was worse than it was now.
810120	813120	And they sent me like five bucks and they're like keep it up.
813120	816120	I think literally that like that one person donating
816120	819120	motivated me because I was just so honored
819120	824120	that someone took their cash that they worked really hard for.
824120	826120	They had a day job.
826120	829120	Or like hell if it was their parents money.
830120	833120	And they decided to give it to me out of everybody else.
833120	836120	And so I literally cried on stream for 10 minutes.
837120	841120	Like for yeah, Rose investment is paying off 100%.
841120	843120	Yeah, shout out to that first person who ever donated to me.
843120	846120	No idea who you are, but thanks.

856120	858120	They don't know I'm a VTuber.
858120	862120	Every time I leave my apartment, that's what I think about.
862120	864120	They don't know I'm a VTuber.
864120	866120	I think it's a patine.
872120	875120	Wondering if I can pick up Rena's purrs.
876120	878120	Purr to like.

937120	939120	And she'll so anytime I'm super stressed out,
939120	941120	she'll just come and she'll purr on me.
941120	943120	Or her sister,
943120	945120	she had a sister named Solay,
945120	947120	Rena and Solay and they were very sweet.
948120	952120	And her sister would come if I was having a really bad day.
952120	954120	She would lick my tears off my face.
954120	957120	Solay and then Rena would just purr on me.
957120	958120	And it was very cute.
958120	959120	My cat there.
959120	960120	I love them to death.

964120	967120	And they're also really dog-like because they like will play fetch with you.
968120	971120	And they're very vocal and I like that because Rena will just yell at me.
972120	974120	My cat, me and his me house farts and leaves all.

979120	980120	With this one audio,
980120	982120	I can determine the size and shape of your cat.
982120	985120	And then I can use algorithms to narrow down whereabouts to.
986120	987120	That'd be impressive.
988120	989120	I'd be like, okay, you know what?
990120	991120	You earned it.
992120	993120	I have cat hair in my mouth.

1056120	1057120	She's a pure bread Siamese.
1057120	1059120	I don't know why she sheds so much.

1073120	1075120	I just think of your strap.
1079120	1081120	It's funny because it's just a comment.
1081120	1083120	It says how I love to hear you.
1083120	1084120	Yeah.
1084120	1085120	I don't really hear the words.
1085120	1086120	I just think of your shit.
1086120	1088120	I don't know why it skips over how I love to hear you.

1110120	1111120	It's very poetic.
1111120	1112120	Cat hair gets everywhere.
1112120	1113120	Very true.
1114120	1115120	Shedding is healthy though, right?
1115120	1116120	Well, she's older.
1116120	1119120	So I feel like she's can't groom herself that well.
1119120	1121120	So I usually brush her once a day.
1121120	1124120	But she's a, she's a sheddy motherfucker.
1124120	1126120	I don't mean no.
1126120	1129120	She likes, she likes to be held in my arms like a little baby.
1129120	1132120	And she looks up at me as I give her forehead kisses.
1132120	1134120	Even though she's, she's 14 years old.
1134120	1136120	She's still, she's still kitten in my eyes.
1136120	1138120	She also still acts like a kitten.
1138120	1141120	Because she'll chase Boomi around if he's pissed her off enough.
1142120	1144120	And it's the funniest thing to see.
1144120	1148120	And then she'll like launch herself that a cat tree and jump there and then start yelling.
1148120	1151120	And I'm like, ma'am, you're going to bust a hip.
1153120	1154120	Yeah, so the best for me.
1154120	1156120	Yeah, I could talk with my cats for hours.
1158120	1160120	I mean, they put on my headphones.
1160120	1162120	I'm just going to hear some scope.
1165120	1166120	Sorry, is yawning?
1167120	1169120	Cleverly disguised Samoyed Dog.
1169120	1170120	Oh my gosh.
1170120	1173120	One of my teachers had a Samoyed Dog and she brought,
1173120	1175120	in his name was Sammy.
1175120	1178120	You know, they always call him Sammy, like Samoyed Sammy's.
1178120	1180120	So I don't know why she named the dog Sammy.
1181120	1185120	But he was the fluffiest dog and I loved him.
1185120	1187120	He was so fluffy.
1187120	1192120	He was also giant because I was like seven when she brought him into class one time.
1192120	1194120	I don't even know how she was allowed to do that.
1194120	1198120	I think she was on vacation and she had a sub and she just came in anyways to show her dog.
1198120	1199120	I don't even know.
1200120	1202120	Yeah, they do shed a lot.
1202120	1204120	Have you seen the acolyte? Is that out?
1205120	1210120	I was pretty psyched by the trailer.
1210120	1212120	I didn't even watch...
1213120	1214120	I was at Dagobah.
1214120	1216120	No, I didn't watch.
1217120	1219120	Oh my God, I haven't kept up.
1219120	1223120	I haven't even watched the third season of the Mandalorian.
1230120	1234120	Yeah, I never watched Andor because I watched like the first two episodes and I was like, I'm bored.
1235120	1237120	Obi-Wan Kenobi was fucking bomb.
1238120	1246120	I got those like lights, like those LED lights that match what's on the screen of your TV.
1246120	1255120	And watching the fight between him and Vader with that just like with all the lights turned off was literally incredible.
1256120	1258120	I didn't watch Ahsoka either.
1259120	1261120	Although I should because I like that actress.
1262120	1264120	I should watch the Bad Batch as well.
1265120	1270120	I should have kept her in my throat.
1271120	1275120	Also congrats on the order of magnitude Twitter growth.
1275120	1276120	Thank you. Thank you.
1276120	1277120	It's probably mostly just sex bots.
1277120	1279120	So I'm not too concerned.
1279120	1281120	Some ways are so hyper in my experience.
1281120	1283120	Whenever I say hi to my dog or they want to do his play.
1283120	1285120	Oh, that's cute.
1286120	1287120	I like behind the TV.
1287120	1291120	Yeah, Boba Fett went downhill.
1292120	1305120	I liked the first part of Boba Fett, but then they brought up the fucking street gang Power Rangers that were like Victorian British people, cyberpunk, steampunk dudes.
1305120	1306120	And I'm like, I'm done.
1306120	1307120	I'm good.
1307120	1309120	Who are these guys?
1309120	1317120	I like the first half when he was with the the I'm blanking on everything man because I haven't watched the show since it came out.
1317120	1318120	And again, I just woke up.
1318120	1320120	So I don't even know what the fuck I'm talking about.
1320120	1321120	Boba Fett.
1323120	1324120	Boba Fett.
1325120	1327120	You know, the sand peoples.
1328120	1329120	Right.
1329120	1330120	I remember.
1333120	1334120	Yeah, and then it becomes.
1334120	1343120	Yeah, then Mando shows up and I'm like, it's just a cleverly disguised like filler season of Mandalorian.
1343120	1350120	Although I fucking love Pablo Pascal, Pedro Pascal.
1353120	1356120	I never watched anything in your Star Wars or the Mandalorian was one of the good stories.
1356120	1359120	Yeah, I highly recommend watching Mandalorian.
1361120	1369120	Boba Fett got his loon Skywalker, but the newer Star Wars movies, I like like the first one was really good.
1370120	1378120	But the last one and the one before it like I was, I was, I know me and my dad were disappointed.
1378120	1381120	My mom was like also like what the hell is this?
1381120	1382120	But like it.
1383120	1386120	Yeah, I'm just too disappointed with the end of the second season to continue.
1386120	1387120	Yeah, second season was a bummer.
1391120	1397120	Wait, yeah, I just wrote all Rogue One is one of my favorite movies, Star Wars movies.
1397120	1404120	Like I think it's like I have a soft spot in my heart for the prequels just because of how camp they are.
1404120	1411120	But like for like newer movies, the Rogue One, I've seen so many times in the prequel.
1411120	1415120	I'm not watching any Star Wars in the original movies and prequel movies.
1415120	1424120	Yeah, like the first one, like what I wish they did is I wish they focused on Finn more because I feel like he should have been the main character instead of what's her fucking face.
1425120	1429120	They gave him like it seemed like he had super pivotal role.
1429120	1430120	They just joined it away from him.
1430120	1435120	And I know like that actor was also really pissed off about that because just how the movies were flowing.
1435120	1438120	It seemed like he was going to be whatever.
1438120	1444120	And like how he like used the force and like lightsaber then he just fucking doesn't do it anymore.
1445120	1447120	I'm like, all right.
1449120	1452120	Actor something bodega whatever his name is.
1452120	1454120	It's pretty pretty good actor too.
1455120	1464120	And I like I like Daisy Ridley, but yeah, and I also just hate like the random love shit thrown in like spoiler alert.
1465120	1468120	Well, I'm not going to say it in case you want to just like watch it after this.
1468120	1478120	But at the in the last movie with the like love stuff or like the random like it just ended so poorly like the last movie and I'm like this is fucking stupid.
1479120	1480120	This is so dumb.
1480120	1481120	I was so mad.
1481120	1483120	And I'm like, who's this random chick?
1483120	1484120	Like who's that person?
1484120	1488120	These are this is a whole side plot that I did not give a shit about.
1491120	1492120	The tiger got me.
1494120	1496120	I peed it because I was were abling the phone.
1496120	1498120	You're trying to help me out, right?
1499120	1500120	And I should have spread it.
1500120	1501120	Yeah, exactly.
1501120	1507120	I wish it kind of would have been like because like it's such a cool story what Finn had.
1507120	1519120	Being a former trooper and then deciding to like like branch off from that and like go his own way and then meeting up with like I thought that was so cool.
1519120	1520120	John Boyega.
1520120	1521120	Yeah, I'm not Bodega.
1526120	1528120	But like I was I was so.
1530120	1534120	I was like, oh my God, like I want a cosplay as female Finn and now I'm like, no.
1534120	1535120	No thanks.
1536120	1537120	You play the follow series.
1537120	1538120	I actually did not.
1538120	1539120	I never play follow.
1540120	1547120	I know I liked the TV show, although I know people were like crying because they people thought they retcon something.
1547120	1554120	I did a lot of research on it because I'm a type of person just reads like every everything up on this series.
1554120	1561120	If it's if I watch the show and don't do the original and I haven't consumed the original media of it.
1561120	1562120	Yeah, exactly.
1562120	1563120	It was such a bait switch.
1563120	1568120	But however, I look when he fights that like shock trooper is probably one of my favorite scenes.
1569120	1572120	The follow series was pretty good.
1572120	1573120	I liked it.
1575120	1585120	I hated Maximus's character with a passion because I would have liked to see what it would have been like for me.
1585120	1601120	Because I would have liked to see what it would have been like for a knight in a squire to like deal with stuff or if he ended up doing what he did, just not being such a little bitch.
1603120	1606120	Like, oh, his character was so annoying to me.
1607120	1614120	Like the main girl, I really like the main girl because I watched this show recently before Fallout came out called Yellow Jackets.
1615120	1619120	Seriously, highly fucking fucking recommend you watch Yellow Jackets.
1619120	1628120	It is one of the best survival horror TV shows I've ever watched and so fucking good.
1628120	1632120	I binged it in the first two seasons.
1632120	1633120	Oh, no, don't worry.
1633120	1634120	I'm not going to spoil it.
1634120	1638120	But but she is one of the main characters in Yellow Jackets.
1638120	1639120	And so I was already kind of biased.
1639120	1644120	But then watching her in this, I just really, really fucking like the show.
1644120	1651120	That the female volleyball team, it was actually a soccer team and they get lost in the wilderness and they have to do fucked up shit to survive.
1651120	1665120	It was literally like, it reminded me a lot of the ritual and it reminded me a lot of what's it called, the game, Sons of the Forest.
1665120	1666120	Yeah.
1667120	1669120	So that was it was a really good show.
1670120	1677120	And then I ended up watching Euphoria after that, not the one that you're thinking of the one about the angsty teenagers that do a lot of drugs.
1679120	1682120	Because my friend was like, oh, you remind me of this character and I watched it.
1682120	1684120	I'm like, why the fuck do I remind you of this character?
1684120	1686120	I am nothing like this character.
1686120	1689120	It's only because we look alike because I look like Zendaya.
1689120	1691120	I don't I don't look like Zendaya.
1691120	1692120	No, I'm taking that back.
1692120	1697120	That woman is gorgeous beyond my beyond my dreams that I could ever be.
1698120	1705120	But in terms of like the hair, the fit, sometimes the attitude, not the drugs.
1707120	1710120	The only drugs I've only taken is my antidepressants.
1712120	1713120	Before.
1716120	1717120	Okie-tokie.
1720120	1722120	Lucy and the ghoul felt like nails on the truck.
1722120	1726120	But yeah, yeah, I also yeah, the ghoul story is really cool.
1727120	1729120	Yeah, everybody everybody else.
1729120	1731120	I was just like, I don't care about you.
1731120	1732120	Yours and Dan.
1732120	1735120	No, I'm not Zendaya.
1735120	1737120	I'll go out together.
1737120	1739120	You'll have to ask my boyfriend, Spiderman.
1741120	1746120	But it was just it was just funny, but I really like that show.
1746120	1751120	It's a shame that one of the one of the producers died and then one of the actors actually died.
1751120	1754120	So from that show, so that's why it's been put off.
1755120	1760120	But it was it was really like it was kind of depressing because I've known people that have grown up in similar situations.
1763120	1765120	How is Timothy Shamalama Dingdong?
1766120	1768120	I feel like he would be very whiny.
1769120	1771120	It's the day of my favorite actress is VTuber.
1771120	1772120	It's really cool.
1772120	1775120	One of my friends was actually in a movie with her because she's an actress and she said she's super sweet.
1775120	1779120	If I ever got okay VTuber ghoul meets Zendaya.
1780120	1782120	I'm putting it up there.
1782120	1783120	Never seen Zendaya.
1783120	1785120	She'd be in the same room.
1788120	1790120	What about the other Zendaya again?
1790120	1791120	She gets it too.
1792120	1794120	I'm not throwing shade at the series.
1794120	1797120	Just pointed out in terms of the lower retcons.
1797120	1799120	But there wasn't even lower retcons.
1799120	1800120	There wasn't even lower retcons though.
1800120	1806120	Like I will argue with that that for you because everybody's worried about shady sands.
1806120	1812120	But just because they didn't specify the time that this thing went off that people are getting frustrated with it.
1814120	1818120	Because I don't feel like they retcons fall out.
1819120	1821120	What was it? 74?
1821120	1822120	I can't remember.
1824120	1826120	I just want to say a quick hello before going to work.
1826120	1827120	Enjoy work.
1827120	1830120	I just remember that Tom Holland and Zendaya got engaged.
1830120	1835120	Honestly, would 100% ship it because they're wholesome.
1835120	1836120	76, New Vegas.
1838120	1839120	I don't fucking know.
1839120	1840120	We're all New Vegas.
1840120	1841120	Again, I haven't played them.
1841120	1844120	I literally own all of them because I buy stuff when it's on sale.
1844120	1845120	I haven't played some.
1846120	1848120	I was debating whether or not to play fall out New Vegas.
1851120	1853120	Because I bought it and everything.
1855120	1858120	When I was going to like the first thing that I play when I debut.
1858120	1860120	But I think Shibi, Shibi.
1861120	1862120	Strony is streaming it.
1863120	1865120	Me and Strony like the same exact fucking games.
1866120	1868120	Because I was like, I was going to do Assassin's Creed.
1868120	1869120	I was going to do Skyrim.
1869120	1872120	I was going to do fall out.
1874120	1877120	You would watch her for like actual skill and endurance streams.
1877120	1882120	And then you'd watch me for my absolute shit show that it would be.
1882120	1887120	Maybe I'll get to those eventually, but I'll probably do them like months down the line.
1889120	1890120	You went off after New Vegas.
1891120	1892120	Yeah, exactly.
1893120	1895120	Like he said, it's like in people.
1896120	1898120	People think that it went off before.
1899120	1900120	So.
1902120	1903120	Sharon Brainsall.
1903120	1904120	Strony 2.0.
1904120	1905120	Hey, she calls me her 2.0.
1905120	1906120	I'm her twin.
1907120	1911120	I'm just the round American version.
1914120	1916120	It's always fun watching the first time I play New Vegas.
1916120	1917120	I've heard, I've heard.
1922120	1924120	I remember reading places.
1924120	1928120	They're like, oh, this person is playing New Vegas because the show like a bunch of people will play New Vegas.
1928120	1929120	And they're like.
1930120	1934120	I only watch like the first two hours because most of the time they only play the first two hours.
1935120	1939120	But it's still a fun unique experience because everyone experiences is differently.
1939120	1940120	What you drinking?
1940120	1945120	I'm drinking some iced lemon and a tea.
1946120	1951120	I, uh, was it called Vokeby is like a Korean brand.
1951120	1954120	They have this really delicious ginger lemon tea that I adore.
1955120	1957120	Skyrim together and co-op.
1957120	1958120	Oh, is that a thing?
1958120	1959120	That'd be sick.
1960120	1962120	I know people are like, oh, you can play Elden Ring.
1962120	1963120	And I'm like, maybe.
1966120	1967120	You guys see me play.
1968120	1969120	Crab souls.
1969120	1970120	I don't know if you want to watch me play Elden Ring.
1972120	1975120	And someone's like, oh, you can call up with Strony.
1975120	1976120	I'm like, oh, shit, true.
1979120	1988120	But then I would have to buy the game again because I played, I played and finished the game on my PlayStation, but I didn't finish it or have it in general on my.
1990120	1993120	Oh, my nose on my PC.
1994120	1995120	Hold on.
1996120	1999120	My manager fixed my overlay, so I should be able to use it properly now.
2001120	2003120	And then we'll get started.
2006120	2007120	Let me do that.
2019120	2022120	My own background music is stuck in my head a good chunk of the time.
2023120	2025120	You're not going to see anything for a second.
2028120	2031120	It's going to fix this real quick, like.
2047120	2048120	Oh, shit.
2049120	2050120	Oh, shit.
2056120	2057120	Oh, I found my.
2060120	2062120	Skyrim co-op kind of jank though.
2062120	2063120	Yeah, but that's what makes it fun.
2066120	2068120	Hey, look at you guys down there near my boobs.
2068120	2069120	Um.
2079120	2081120	Hey, what a guan.
2082120	2084120	What a guan, what a guan.
2084120	2085120	Hold on.
2090120	2091120	You ride at dawn.
2092120	2095120	Well, shit, there's, you guys are too tall.
2100120	2103120	See now it's just on a circle that just is there.
2103120	2104120	Is there.
2106120	2107120	It was fun while it lasted.
2107120	2108120	What do you mean?
2108120	2109120	The app?
2111120	2113120	I'm still going to yap a bunch during Stanley Parable.
2113120	2115120	It's like a perfect yapping game.
2117120	2118120	Music stuck in your head.
2118120	2119120	Oh.
2120120	2121120	I can't die.
2121120	2122120	Okay, there we go.
2122120	2123120	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
2130120	2133120	Yeah, there's a child screaming running down the hallway.
2133120	2134120	I'll hear them in a moment.
2138120	2140120	I think it's finally filtering them out.
2153120	2154120	Oh, I can't.
2157120	2158120	Oh, I know why.
2160120	2163120	I was like, why can't I edit the properties of this
2163120	2165120	and change the transformation?
2165120	2168120	Because anytime I lock something, you can't do that.
2177120	2179120	We're up all night to get lucky.
2179120	2181120	If we are too tall, you could step on us.
2181120	2183120	Yeah, put your lucky down for size.
2189120	2190120	What just happened?
2190120	2192120	You guys just flew away.
2204120	2205120	What's up?
2205120	2206120	Why is it working?
2208120	2209120	Oh.
2210120	2212120	I've got to lock a whole thing.
2212120	2214120	All right, there you go.
2216120	2217120	Are you happy now?
2221120	2222120	Is that good?
2228120	2229120	We did it.
2229120	2230120	Yeah, I didn't see him out.
2230120	2231120	We did it.
2232120	2235120	She finally fixed her overlay and whatever.
2235120	2236120	She did it.
2236120	2237120	She did it.
2237120	2238120	She did it.
2238120	2239120	She did it.
2242120	2244120	Okay, fuck my BGM for a second.
2244120	2246120	Hey, what's up?
2246120	2248120	Oh my God, what the fuck just happened?
2253120	2255120	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
2257120	2260120	Stanley Parable is fucking with my overlord.
2260120	2262120	Is fucking with my pages.
2262120	2263120	Oh my God.
2264120	2265120	That is wild.
2265120	2267120	Okay, let's try again.
2274120	2277120	Oh my God, I need to take it off a full screen.
2282120	2283120	My head in the way.
2285120	2288120	Actually, I kind of might stick it over there like that
2289120	2290120	and then move myself.
2290120	2292120	Phoebe, you should have done this before a stream.
2292120	2293120	I don't care.
2295120	2297120	It's funnier when things are scoppy.
2297120	2299120	Yeah, because it's cutting off the bottom of the screen.
2299120	2300120	I might have to do a window.
2300120	2301120	Yeah.
2303120	2304120	Yeah.
2305120	2306120	Yeah.
2306120	2307120	Yeah.
2307120	2308120	Give it to me now.
2308120	2309120	Give it to me now.
2309120	2311120	My dad is asking me why he hasn't heard from me.
2312120	2313120	What's up, redacted?
2313120	2314120	What are you doing?
2314120	2315120	Where are you?
2315120	2316120	Where are you?
2317120	2318120	What's up, redacted?
2318120	2319120	What are you doing?
2319120	2320120	Where are you?
2320120	2322120	Sometimes my parents will just text me
2322120	2324120	and they'll be like, are you alive?
2325120	2326120	I'm like, yes, I'm alive.
2326120	2328120	They're like, okay, why haven't you called?
2328120	2330120	I'm like, because I don't know.
2337120	2339120	I was like, what is this?
2339120	2340120	What is this?
2346120	2348120	Yeah, I don't know why it's the demo.
2348120	2350120	Yes, because it's only 30 minutes.
2351120	2353120	I'm not paying for a full game that I know
2353120	2355120	I'm not going to finish, guys.
2358120	2359120	Sorry to break it to you.
2361120	2363120	I'm playing the 30 minute free demo
2363120	2365120	because I can stretch that shit to five hours
2365120	2366120	if I really want.
2370120	2371120	Demo.
2372120	2373120	I'm alive.
2377120	2378120	It's the same.
2378120	2379120	Wait for it to notice.
2379120	2380120	What do you mean?
2381120	2382120	Oh, wait, I forgot.
2382120	2383120	The chats delayed.
2384120	2386120	I should put the newest stuff first, actually.
2396120	2398120	No, the demo is actually just like
2398120	2400120	literally just the first 30 minutes of it.
2401120	2406120	Oh, my, the game is $24.
2406120	2412120	I'm, I am a broke bunny.
2413120	2417120	So I am selling my voice to a weird cuttlefish
2417120	2418120	I met on the street.
2430120	2432120	Yeah, but, you know, we just started up.
2432120	2433120	Don't ignore me.
2433120	2436120	Just like sweating and being mad.
2451120	2453120	Aren't you happy I streamed twice today?
2453120	2455120	You get double the scope.
2455120	2457120	Listen, I've only been here for a week.
2457120	2459120	You got to cut me some slack.
2461120	2462120	Adam's already upset.
2462120	2463120	No, I'm not upset.
2464120	2465120	I'm just tired.
2468120	2469120	I'm just tired.
2469120	2470120	I just woke up.
2473120	2474120	It's like my first week here.
2475120	2476120	I'm just tired.
2476120	2477120	I'm just tired.
2477120	2478120	I'm just tired.
2479120	2480120	I'm just tired.
2480120	2481120	I'm just tired.
2481120	2482120	I just woke up.
2483120	2484120	I think I've done it.
2484120	2485120	I think I've done it.
2486120	2487120	I think I've done it.
2487120	2488120	I think I've done it.
2488120	2489120	I think I've done it.
2489120	2490120	I think I've done it.
2490120	2491120	I think that's good.
2491120	2492120	Wait, what?
2494120	2496120	Where did the, huh?
2499120	2501120	Your names aren't coming up from a little ticker.
2501120	2502120	But, oh.
2503120	2505120	Why does stuff break?
2506120	2508120	Why does it break?
2508120	2510120	Why do it break?
2510120	2512120	Why do it break?
2512120	2514120	Why do it break?
2514120	2516120	Oh, I know why.
2516120	2518120	Oh, I know why.
2518120	2520120	No, I don't know why.
2520120	2522120	Why is it?
2522120	2524120	Is it showing y'all?
2524120	2526120	It's just not.
2526120	2528120	Please.
2528120	2530120	Please.
2530120	2532120	Please, it's all right.
2532120	2534120	Please, it's all right.
2534120	2536120	It's all right.

2542120	2544120	Please, it's all right.
2544120	2546120	Please, it's all right.
2546120	2548120	Please, it's all right.
2548120	2550120	No, I didn't want that in there,
2550120	2552120	or whatever.
2552120	2554120	I'm just going to cry quietly
2554120	2556120	as I do,
2556120	2558120	as one does, you know.
2558120	2560120	Oh, crap.
2560120	2562120	No, wait.

2717400	2720400	I'm just gonna run in a window anyways.
2720400	2722400	Okay!
2724400	2726400	Hey-yo!
2726400	2728400	Where'd my OBS go?
2728400	2730400	Oh, there she is.
2730400	2750400	Oh my god, this still is not the way I want, so I'm just gonna tuck it like that.
2750400	2756400	How good is this gonna get, ladies and gentlemen?
2756400	2758400	I also don't know what the master class is.
2758400	2760400	Age is 16? 9?
2764400	2768400	An alt becomes a main? No! My alt's not gonna be my main.
2768400	2770400	I don't know.
2770400	2774400	I was thinking about it, because I'm like, should I make my alt that my main?
2774400	2778400	And then I'm like, no, because I get a lot.
2778400	2782400	It's easier for me to talk to you guys on my actual main than my parent.
2782400	2784400	I don't know.
2784400	2786400	I don't know.
2786400	2788400	I don't know.
2788400	2790400	I don't know.
2790400	2792400	I don't know.
2792400	2794400	I don't know.
2794400	2796400	I don't know.
2796400	2798400	My actual main and my parent.
2798400	2800400	In my opinion.
2804400	2806400	Oh!
2806400	2808400	What the f-
2808400	2810400	I was like waiting for it to change.
2816400	2818400	That's quite loud.

2856400	2858400	What?
2858400	2860400	Is this the demo?
2878400	2880400	What?
2880400	2882400	Did I go in a circle?
2883400	2885400	My number is 27.
2885400	2886400	Oh.
2887400	2888400	Hi.
2893400	2894400	Okay.
2896400	2898400	Waiting room.
2901400	2903400	Why does that coffee look like blood?
2903400	2905400	Can I pick stuff up?
2906400	2909400	What does it say? Stanley Parable demo.
2913400	2915400	Should I?
2916400	2918400	Alright, looks like I got to wait.
2919400	2922400	Sorry guys. I can't sit down, so I'll just...
2924400	2926400	Okay, I'll sit down over here.
2928400	2930400	Almost my turn.
2932400	2935400	Wait, I can't see the chat. What happened to the chat?
2935400	2937400	Yeah.
2950400	2952400	Yes, my stuff is clicky.
2954400	2956400	I made it.
2956400	2958400	Gorgeous.
2958400	2960400	Famous demos.
2960400	2962400	We got...
2962400	2965400	We got Snake there. We got...
2966400	2968400	I thought it was Game & Watch for a second.
2969400	2971400	What is that?
2975400	2977400	I don't know what these games are.
2982400	2988400	We were playing the demo. Yes, I'm not spending money on the real game when I'm not going to finish it.
2992400	2995400	Oh, man.
3022400	3024400	Wash over you.
3039400	3045400	I wonder if I get a cool ending if I literally just walked away from my computer and didn't touch anything.
3047400	3050400	Because I know that shit happens in this game.
3052400	3057400	That explains clearly and concisely exactly what the Stanley Parable is.
3057400	3058400	How it plays...
3058400	3060400	I feel like I'm in office in Counter Strike.
3062400	3064400	It's probably the same assets.
3066400	3069400	Oh my god, it is the same assets. I'm nostalgic.
3071400	3073400	I only just realized that now that they use the same assets.
3076400	3078400	Let's go with the demo counter.
3079400	3081400	Here is one such technology.
3081400	3087400	These buttons are meant to convey the meaning of choice and the impact of the decisions you make.
3087400	3089400	Can I press a button?
3089400	3092400	Please. Please let me press the button.
3095400	3096400	Please.
3099400	3103400	What is this? Oh, I want to do this one.
3108400	3113400	All people who select that particular button are sexual predators.
3113400	3119400	You see, our choices really do illuminate the very intangible nature of our minds and souls.
3119400	3121400	What the hell is this?
3149400	3152400	I'm the 6% that's not a sexual predator.
3153400	3155400	I'm just a sexual deviant.
3158400	3159400	The buffalo.
3160400	3164400	Well, technology, oh my god.
3169400	3170400	No way.
3172400	3174400	Oh, what the fuck?
3175400	3179400	Oh, I wanted to walk through the wall like a badass.
3185400	3191400	I'm actually like pretty out of work. How do I get up there?
3191400	3194400	I can't get up there, can I? I can't parkour.
3195400	3196400	Down here.
3199400	3203400	Just a isolation chamber. They put me in one of those.
3204400	3206400	Put me in a room, a rubber room.
3207400	3208400	Rubber room filler ads.
3215400	3219400	I'm like too low to the ground. I can't reach my keyboard properly.
3221400	3222400	Raise my chair.
3226400	3227400	Okay, there we go.
3228400	3231400	Discovery or despair? Let's go with despair.
3234400	3239400	These crags that we stood upon, they shielded us from our own ignorance.
3240400	3241400	I'm not short.
3243400	3245400	We're probably taller than the majority of you.
3254400	3256400	Can I see the other ones?
3258400	3259400	Is there like...
3261400	3262400	Okay, fine.
3264400	3268400	Ooh, you went in both boos? Oh, how vulnerable of you.
3268400	3274400	If at any point during the demo you need to cry, just let me know and we can take a minute.
3275400	3278400	Demo status, demo compliments.
3281400	3286400	One of the most important parts of administering any demonstration is pumping out your ego.
3286400	3287400	Yeah!
3287400	3289400	...in securities about your sense of self-worth.
3289400	3290400	I'm ready!
3290400	3295400	That's why we use this room to develop cheap compliments to share on the production of the demo.
3295400	3301400	Go ahead and press that button to see some of the superficial flattery we've been cooking up.
3301400	3302400	I'm excited, okay.
3303400	3309400	My heavens, I've never met someone who can consume as much uranium in a single sitting as you can.
3309400	3311400	Just look at you go.
3312400	3314400	Can I get another compliment?
3314400	3318400	Of all the people I know who are playing this exact demo at this exact moment
3318400	3324400	and standing in this exact room, your performance is easily in the top 5,000.
3324400	3325400	Oh my god.
3326400	3327400	Oh!
3327400	3329400	I won't go as far as 4,600.
3329400	3330400	Oh.
3331400	3332400	Yeah.
3339400	3343400	This device tells you whether or not you're inside a video game demonstration.
3343400	3344400	I think I am.
3344400	3351400	There's also a device that tells you whether or not you're inside a device that tells you whether or not you're inside a video game demonstration.
3352400	3354400	This game is so meta.
3364400	3365400	Ooh!
3365400	3366400	Wait, what?
3366400	3367400	Wait.
3367400	3368400	I get turned around a lot.
3368400	3372400	Ah, now this room is perhaps the most important Joel encounter in the demo.
3372400	3376400	This is where we determine whether or not the demo has been effective.
3376400	3377400	No!
3377400	3378400	What are you doing?
3378400	3379400	You can't make that decision.
3379400	3380400	Yeah, you haven't played the demo.
3380400	3382400	We've put so much work into it.
3382400	3383400	Is this not the demo?
3384400	3386400	I was so ready to press no.
3392400	3394400	Do you want me to turn up the game?
3394400	3395400	Is it too quiet?
3399400	3401400	And there you have it.
3401400	3405400	Everything you need to know about how video game demos are made.
3406400	3407400	Let them cook.
3407400	3408400	It's a little quiet.
3408400	3409400	Okay.
3409400	3410400	I thought it was too loud.
3410400	3411400	Meow.
3414400	3416400	You don't want to simmer or want to broil?
3416400	3417400	Mmm.
3419400	3422400	Makes you want to broil you like a little crab and eat you up.
3423400	3426400	You suck on your little leggies for your sweet, sweet flesh.
3427400	3430400	However, it's still important that we address safety concerns.
3430400	3431400	I'm going to jump us up.
3436400	3437400	Emotion sickness.
3437400	3440400	Another reason I didn't get this is I think I was going to get really motion sick.
3443400	3444400	I see you right there.
3445400	3450400	Please do not press the large red glowing disagree button at this time.
3451400	3452400	Nothing.
3452400	3453400	No objections.
3453400	3455400	You're quite sure about that.
3455400	3456400	There's no disagree button.
3456400	3457400	Well, all right then.
3457400	3461400	In the event that you do experience one or all of the previously listed symptoms.
3461400	3463400	I'm going to bleed for my anus from playing this game.
3463400	3466400	You need to convey to me that you wish the demonstration.
3466400	3467400	Oh, a reflex.
3467400	3468400	I probably case a calamari.
3468400	3469400	Ooh, I love calamari.
3469400	3470400	Don't tell Strani.
3470400	3471400	What the?
3472400	3473400	Dance perimeter.
3473400	3474400	Please perform a dance.
3476400	3477400	Oh, fuck.
3480400	3487400	Your dance has been recorded in the event that you feel confused or disoriented by anything you see inside the demo.
3487400	3491400	Perform that dance and I will terminate the demo immediately.
3491400	3492400	Okay.
3492400	3493400	Right.
3493400	3494400	All preparations have been made.
3494400	3497400	It is time at the fast.
3497400	3500400	Are you prepared for a dance perimeter?
3501400	3502400	Whoa.
3510400	3511400	It's kind of terrifying.
3515400	3516400	What?
3518400	3519400	It kill me?
3527400	3528400	What's that?
3530400	3531400	Forget waiting.
3543400	3544400	Dance perimeter.
3552400	3553400	I'm so excited.
3554400	3556400	Oh my God.
3556400	3557400	Oh well.
3557400	3558400	I'm making myself dizzy.
3561400	3562400	Oh wait.
3562400	3563400	What's this?
3563400	3564400	Huh?
3566400	3567400	Can I leave?
3569400	3570400	Okay.
3570400	3571400	It's a giant eight.
3571400	3572400	Eight.
3578400	3579400	Damn girl.
3579400	3580400	You really.
3580400	3581400	Eight.
3581400	3582400	The outfit up.
3587400	3588400	Hey man.
3588400	3589400	Do you eat?
3589400	3590400	Do you?
3590400	3591400	Fuck.
3593400	3594400	I really.
3595400	3597400	Her pussy the other day.
3598400	3599400	I really.
3600400	3601400	His ass.
3606400	3607400	Running out of the game.
3610400	3612400	It's like the equivalent of 42.
3613400	3615400	Should I check who's guy?
3616400	3617400	I like this game.
3619400	3622400	Why six or three to seven because 79.
3625400	3626400	Oh, okay.
3626400	3627400	I can go backwards.
3627400	3628400	All right.
3635400	3636400	I would have been very happy.
3636400	3638400	I didn't pay for the full game.
3639400	3640400	No, I like.
3640400	3641400	I like the Stanley parable.
3641400	3642400	Stanley parable is a great game.
3642400	3644400	I've watched people play it.
3645400	3647400	But again, I don't.
3647400	3648400	Because it's a long ish game.
3648400	3650400	I just didn't think I would be able to get through it.
3658400	3659400	Okay.
3659400	3661400	Now let's take a minute to get something straight here.
3662400	3663400	Can I get a soda?
3663400	3667400	You are assuming an amount of responsibility for its outcome.
3667400	3668400	Is there anything?
3668400	3670400	We had us eight in Runderland.
3672400	3673400	Eight.
3676400	3677400	I wish I could jump.
3678400	3683400	This time, please take a minute to think about all of the mistakes you've made in playing this demonstration.
3683400	3686400	As well as your lack of respect for demo taking in general.
3687400	3688400	Opening the game.
3689400	3690400	I shouldn't have gotten the game.
3690400	3691400	I'm kind of happy.
3691400	3694400	I didn't make the mistake of buying the full game.
3695400	3699400	But I kind of like walked and I got turned around a bunch.
3700400	3701400	Okay.
3705400	3707400	Why am I so small in the corner?
3707400	3708400	Hold on.
3708400	3709400	I just realized I looked over.
3709400	3710400	I noticed how small I was.
3710400	3711400	Oh.
3715400	3716400	I went back.
3726400	3727400	Well, hello there.
3728400	3729400	All right.
3730400	3731400	What is this black void?
3733400	3736400	I didn't know your asshole was a feature of the game.
3736400	3737400	Okay.
3742400	3743400	I can't see shit.
3744400	3745400	Oh.
3747400	3748400	Wow.
3755400	3756400	Did she not detach yet?
3757400	3758400	I'm sure of it.
3758400	3759400	Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
3760400	3761400	We have to get out of here.
3761400	3763400	We have to find something for you to do anything.
3764400	3765400	The demo cannot.
3765400	3767400	It is a good song by Marilyn Martinez.
3767400	3768400	This way.
3768400	3769400	Okay.
3772400	3773400	I love the narrator's voice though.
3774400	3776400	Surely there must be a game somewhere in here.
3777400	3778400	Got a giant TV.
3782400	3783400	Vine boom noise.
3783400	3784400	Pick it up.
3784400	3785400	Whoa.
3785400	3786400	What the fuck?
3786400	3787400	I can't.
3787400	3790400	Now put it in the bin.
3793400	3795400	What if I just wait?
3795400	3796400	I can't.
3798400	3799400	What the hell?
3799400	3800400	Did I just stand on it?
3800400	3801400	I'm standing on it.
3801400	3802400	What the fuck?
3804400	3807400	Can I just fucking break it?
3807400	3808400	Break stuff.
3811400	3813400	Disrespect your surroundings.
3815400	3817400	Oh, I missed.
3818400	3819400	Okay, I got it.
3819400	3821400	Disrespect your surroundings.
3822400	3823400	You did it.
3823400	3824400	You won.
3824400	3825400	You know what you get for winning?
3825400	3826400	An achievement.
3826400	3827400	Four ton narrator.
3832400	3833400	I won?
3833400	3834400	Oh my god.
3836400	3837400	Can't even see it in there.
3841400	3842400	I can't see that.
3845400	3849400	I didn't even see what that said.
3850400	3852400	She threw it on the ground.
3858400	3859400	What?
3860400	3861400	Let me out.
3861400	3863400	Help me, I'm on fire.
3865400	3867400	Can I throw myself in the trash?
3867400	3869400	Don't be on that now, aren't we?
3870400	3872400	Come along, let's get to the end and the final choice.
3872400	3874400	I just hope they paid this man so well
3874400	3876400	because he did such a good job narrating this game.
3876400	3878400	Ending, ending, where are you?
3878400	3879400	Where are you?
3879400	3880400	Oh.
3882400	3885400	This is where the red disagree button went.
3885400	3886400	What?
3887400	3888400	Is this a horror game?
3891400	3892400	Yes, the end.
3893400	3895400	Now this is where we want the demo to be.
3896400	3898400	I think it's time for you to log your final decision
3898400	3901400	as to whether or not the Stanley Parable is any good.
3901400	3902400	Oh, sweet.
3903400	3906400	Please consider very carefully before answering.
3906400	3907400	Much is at stake.
3907400	3908400	Is it?
3910400	3911400	Is it working?
3912400	3913400	Are you sure?
3914400	3915400	Are you sure you pressed the button?
3916400	3917400	Oh, jeez, fuck.
3918400	3919400	We finished the demo.
3919400	3920400	Did it start again?
3921400	3922400	Hello?
3922400	3924400	Is anyone there?
3924400	3926400	They already finished.
3926400	3927400	They said they liked it.
3927400	3929400	I need someone to stop the demo.
3929400	3930400	Hello?
3931400	3932400	Hello?
3933400	3934400	We need to get out of here.
3935400	3936400	Let's blow this popsicle stand.
3938400	3939400	I can't run.
3939400	3940400	I can crouch.
3942400	3943400	What the frick?
3944400	3945400	Let me just go.
3945400	3946400	No?
3946400	3947400	All right.
3947400	3948400	Time to go to the fun room.
3948400	3949400	What's going on?
3949400	3950400	Where is everyone?
3950400	3951400	Okay.
3951400	3952400	Over to the left.
3952400	3953400	Down this way.
3964400	3965400	Ow, my ears.
3967400	3969400	Quick in the isolation chamber.
3971400	3973400	Oh, nice and quiet.
3974400	3975400	Finally.
3975400	3977400	I suppose we can both agree that I failed.
3979400	3980400	My job was to be a teacher.
3980400	3982400	You remember the isolation chamber?
3982400	3983400	Yeah, I was.
3983400	3984400	I saw it.
3984400	3986400	Exactly what the Stanley Parable is supposed to be.
3987400	3988400	But somehow I couldn't.
3990400	3994400	Well, at any rate, I don't know if I care for the Stanley Parable anymore.
3994400	3995400	Scammed.
3995400	3997400	Do you think any of this is actually in the main game?
3998400	3999400	Honestly, I don't think so.
3999400	4000400	Ever ball out of time, chamber?
4000400	4001400	That even looked like.
4002400	4003400	No.
4003400	4004400	I think I've had enough of it.
4005400	4006400	No more doors.
4006400	4007400	No more demonstrations.
4008400	4009400	No more endings.
4011400	4014400	I wonder if this guy has voice acted like anything else,
4014400	4017400	or like, because I just feel like he should be an actor in a movie.
4022400	4023400	It's so lovely.
4023400	4025400	I kind of want to eat the leaves on this plant.
4025400	4026400	They're edible, right?
4028400	4029400	Excuse me.
4030400	4031400	Can I eat this chair?
4032400	4033400	Can I pick anything up?
4036400	4037400	Yeah.
4038400	4039400	Yeah, I do.
4039400	4040400	What the fuck?
4040400	4041400	How the hell did I get here?
4050400	4051400	God?
4055400	4056400	Jesus, please.
4059400	4060400	Holy ghost.
4062400	4063400	Make it stop.
4068400	4069400	Thank you, the cup.
4072400	4073400	What?
4074400	4076400	We never did that until now.
4079400	4080400	What?
4081400	4082400	Huh?
4083400	4084400	What?
4085400	4086400	Ah!
4087400	4088400	What?
4094400	4097400	This is such a creative thing to do for a demo, though.
4099400	4100400	Ah!
4102400	4103400	What the fuck?
4103400	4105400	He's just teleporting me.
4106400	4107400	Let's eat everything.
4107400	4109400	I just like to chew on stuff, to be honest with you.
4114400	4115400	Where is it?
4116400	4117400	Where is it?
4119400	4120400	I'm in an elevator, please.
4129400	4130400	I'm getting so much motion sickness from the...
4130400	4132400	Yeah, that's another reason why I didn't think I could play it.
4134400	4135400	I'm also whipping around.
4135400	4137400	It's easier, like, it's easier on me right now
4137400	4140400	because I'm controlling it and I know what I'm going to do.
4140400	4142400	But for you guys, I'm just like,
4142400	4143400	Sorry.
4145400	4146400	Release me.
4146400	4148400	The madam cannot be caged.
4151400	4153400	Oh, this looks like their original game.
4158400	4159400	Taking sippies.
4168400	4169400	Hell yeah, guys, it's out now.
4173400	4176400	Okay, maybe I should have gotten the game.
4180400	4183400	Because I thought the demo was like the first 30 minutes of the game.
4183400	4184400	But I was wrong.
4186400	4187400	I was incorrect.
4189400	4190400	Out now? No way.
4190400	4191400	It's always the next time.
4191400	4192400	It really depends.
4192400	4194400	Like, I don't know if you guys want me to play it.
4196400	4197400	Oh, for real, damn.
4197400	4199400	They should bring Stanley Paramore to our attention.

4358400	4360400	I'm just a disembodied voice
4361400	4363400	with some background music now.
4364400	4366400	I just got Thanos snapped.
4366400	4368400	Oh, man.

4387400	4388400	I guess.
4391400	4392400	I guess I was just a figment
4392400	4394400	of your imagination the entire time.
4397400	4398400	I'm so sorry.

4430400	4431400	Hold on.
4432400	4434400	I had the ropes and whips.
4434400	4435400	This is truly the meaning
4435400	4437400	of the Stanley Parable.
4437400	4438400	Bad ending.
4438400	4439400	We took the meds.
4439400	4441400	So I played Needy Schumer Overdose.
4441400	4442400	Overloaded Overdose.
4442400	4443400	I forget.

4462400	4464400	if I told you this was all intentional?
4467400	4468400	Because it actually is.
4472400	4473400	It's all...
4474400	4475400	It's all a figment
4475400	4477400	of your imagination.
4478400	4479400	Whoa.
4481400	4483400	Wait, but why am I not moving?
4486400	4487400	Please.

4520400	4522400	Why do I look so creepy?
4525400	4528400	My models are slowly moving back and forth.
4531400	4532400	Okay, okay.
4540400	4542400	What's going on?

4562400	4563400	Don't worry about it.
4564400	4565400	I'm stalling
4566400	4567400	for time.
4568400	4569400	We're reaching levels of scoff.
4569400	4571400	That shouldn't be possible.
4572400	4574400	You know what my temptation is right now?
4576400	4577400	Is
4578400	4579400	is
4581400	4583400	is just going to play in RuneScape
4584400	4586400	and stream sniping her.
4588400	4589400	That sounds fun.
4590400	4591400	Text...
4591400	4592400	I've never played RuneScape before.
4593400	4594400	Excuse me.
4595400	4597400	I remember growing up
4597400	4599400	in that aforementioned
4599400	4601400	after school program.
4601400	4603400	We had like a computer room and stuff.
4604400	4605400	And um,
4605400	4606400	I don't know why my model is like freaking out,
4606400	4608400	but I'll just let her do her thing.
4610400	4612400	And this kid was playing RuneScape
4612400	4613400	on one of the computers.
4613400	4615400	And I'm like, oh, that looks really fun and cool.
4615400	4616400	Can I play?
4616400	4617400	And he's like, nah,
4617400	4618400	this is only for boys.
4618400	4619400	And I'm like,
4620400	4622400	oh, and I like genuinely believed him
4622400	4624400	that only boys could play for some reason.
4625400	4627400	So I never played RuneScape.
4629400	4631400	Secret cheapy horse stream.
4632400	4634400	But I just stare awkwardly at you.
4635400	4637400	And my body jerks around.
4639400	4641400	Mastered the power of scuff and nightmares.
4641400	4644400	If only I had like multiple models
4644400	4646400	to run right now.
4646400	4648400	Maybe I can like cut off my head.
4648400	4650400	That would take too long though.
4650400	4651400	As I cut off my head.
4655400	4656400	Damn it.
4656400	4657400	Damn it.
4661400	4662400	So um,
4663400	4664400	how was your day?
4665400	4666400	My stall,
4666400	4667400	I'm losing,
4667400	4668400	I'm losing my stalling ability.
4670400	4671400	Finishing levels.
4672400	4673400	Yeah,
4673400	4674400	I just beat the entire game.
4674400	4675400	That's crazy.
4677400	4678400	Pass bad at your per...
4678400	4679400	Yeah, I know.
4679400	4680400	I'm like...
4684400	4685400	For the funny.
4687400	4690400	RuneScape is 90% male player base
4690400	4691400	even today.
4691400	4693400	Most MMOs at 50-50.
4693400	4694400	Oh, interesting.
4695400	4696400	Although,
4696400	4698400	I would probably just like make,
4698400	4699400	see if I can um,
4700400	4702400	see if I can like trick
4702400	4703400	strongy
4704400	4706400	into falling in love with me online.
4707400	4709400	You think I can groom my gen mate
4710400	4711400	in RuneScape
4712400	4713400	without her knowing?
4717400	4719400	Streep's not the color fish.
4722400	4723400	Got to like kick out.
4723400	4724400	Be like,
4724400	4725400	hey, I'm Kyle.

4742400	4744400	taking sheebie to the
4744400	4745400	willdy?
4751400	4752400	Alright,
4752400	4753400	I forgot we had the prehensile
4753400	4754400	hair.
4754400	4755400	That was a real horror stream.
4755400	4756400	Yeah, I'm trying to think of
4756400	4757400	something funny to do
4759400	4761400	for 6K on Twitter
4761400	4762400	with the
4763400	4764400	3D thing.
4765400	4766400	I'm like trying to get
4766400	4767400	manager to make something for me,
4767400	4768400	but I have to think of a song
4769400	4770400	in a dance.
4772400	4773400	Uh huh.
4774400	4776400	I've had Karba stuck in my head
4776400	4777400	for a long time.
4777400	4778400	Don't worry about my models.
4778400	4779400	She,
4779400	4780400	we're fine.
4780400	4781400	She's good.
4781400	4782400	I'm good.
4783400	4784400	It's good.
4784400	4785400	Don't worry about it.
4787400	4788400	Oh no.
4788400	4789400	My stream just

4800400	4801400	Oh god.
4805400	4806400	Hahaha.
4816400	4817400	Karba's a bitch.
4818400	4820400	I should have known better
4820400	4822400	if I was a bitch.
4827400	4828400	Oh wow.
4828400	4829400	Whoa.
4829400	4830400	Holy crap.
4830400	4831400	Hold on.
4831400	4832400	Something's happening.
4832400	4833400	I don't know what,
4833400	4835400	but something's going on.
4836400	4837400	Going on.
4837400	4838400	Like Donkey Kong.
4838400	4839400	Oh my god.
4839400	4840400	Where did I?
4844400	4845400	What is happening?
4852400	4853400	Whoa.
4855400	4857400	Wowee, Zowie.
4859400	4860400	My stream for a little bit longer today.
4860400	4862400	Just to make up for all the scuff
4862400	4864400	and me just talking about nothing.
4871400	4872400	I just look,
4872400	4875400	why do I look high as fuck?
4879400	4880400	Whoa, what is this?
4880400	4882400	That's crazy.
4883400	4885400	Where did this come from?
4885400	4886400	Whoa.
4887400	4889400	This is not what I was stalling for
4889400	4890400	or anything.
4890400	4892400	I'm having absolute fuck all.
4895400	4896400	Oh wow.
4897400	4899400	What a cool game.
4909400	4910400	Nice zoo.

4937400	4938400	Well, I'm tired,
4938400	4940400	so I bet some people will be like,
4940400	4942400	I'm pretty sure she was high as fuck.
4942400	4944400	No, I'm just tired.
4944400	4946400	Especially because it was up at 6 a.m.
4947400	4949400	Come as a bitch,
4949400	4952400	I should know better.
4952400	4953400	I wonder why she lagged.
4953400	4954400	I know, right?
4954400	4955400	I don't.

4969400	4971400	Somnis Vivarum.
4971400	4972400	You'll never know.
4973400	4975400	Your name sounds like a spell from Elden Ring.
4978400	4979400	How weird, huh?
4982400	4983400	Of a girl named Sheebie.
4986400	4988400	Sheebie worked for a big company.
4993400	4994400	This is clearly source.

5032400	5033400	And then one day something peculiar happened.
5033400	5034400	This is the arrow.
5034400	5035400	This is me right now.
5035400	5037400	Something that would forever change Stanley.
5038400	5039400	Something he would never quite forget.
5041400	5043400	He had been at his desk for nearly an hour
5043400	5045400	when he realized that not one
5045400	5046400	single order

5190140	5192140	My stream died for me.
5192140	5194140	And I lost like half of everybody.
5197140	5199140	Oh my god.
5199140	5202140	He really got teleported to Kiara's stream.
5202140	5204140	Oh no.
5204140	5206140	Everybody literally is gone.
5208140	5209140	Do I give up?
5210140	5211140	Do I just...
5212140	5214140	Do I just end it here?
5215140	5220140	I got the funniest ending just by sitting in the thing as I died.
5220140	5222140	I didn't even fucking notice.
5225140	5226140	What the fuck?
5227140	5228140	Why can't I leave?
5235140	5236140	No mourners, no funerals.
5239140	5240140	Come on.
5241140	5242140	Please.
5244140	5245140	Forever.
5246140	5247140	I will be happy.
5247140	5248140	Stanley waited.
5249140	5250140	Hours passed.
5250140	5251140	Then days.
5252140	5253140	Had years gone by.
5253140	5255140	He no longer had the ability to tell.
5256140	5257140	But the one thing we knew for sure...
5257140	5258140	Give me the fuck out of here.
5258140	5261140	Was that if he waited long enough, the answers would come.
5261140	5262140	Oh my god.
5263140	5264140	I'm literally gonna go crazy.
5265140	5266140	Soon.
5266140	5267140	Very soon now.
5267140	5268140	This will end.
5268140	5270140	He will be spoken to.
5270140	5272140	He will be told what to do.
5272140	5274140	Please, please, please, please, please.
5274140	5275140	I'm just getting claustrophobic.
5275140	5276140	The walls are closing in.
5287140	5288140	Stream is having serious issues.
5288140	5289140	What the fuck?
5291140	5292140	Okay, okay, okay.
5293140	5294140	Okay.
5295140	5299140	I think because the stream is just being so fucky for some reason, I might...
5300140	5303140	I'm also having really bad lagging issues looking back at my own stream.
5305140	5306140	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5320140	5321140	Oh my god.
5321140	5322140	What the fuck?
5326140	5327140	Jesus.
5327140	5330140	I just know it's gonna die on me again because when this happens a bunch...
5333140	5335140	When this happens a bunch, I know my stream is gonna hold on,
5335140	5337140	but I'm like super tempted to do something before that.
5339140	5341140	I like really want to go on RuneScape and bother Shawnee.
5346140	5347140	Let me turn off Stanley Parable.
5347140	5348140	I'm sorry guys.
5352140	5354140	How do I... Do I have to make an account?
5357140	5358140	Okay.
5362140	5363140	Old school RuneScape.
5368140	5370140	I'm just gonna casually stream.
5370140	5371140	Don't tell her.
5371140	5372140	Don't fucking tell her.
5373140	5374140	Don't tell her.
5374140	5375140	You little bitches.
5377140	5378140	I know you fucking want to.
5379140	5380140	You little bitches.
5383140	5384140	It's free to make the account.
5384140	5385140	All right.
5388140	5390140	I've never played RuneScape in my life.
5392140	5393140	My internet lasts long enough.
5393140	5394140	Hold on.
5394140	5395140	We'll find out.
5399140	5403140	I just think my computer just can't handle the Stanley Parable for some reason.
5404140	5405140	That's kidding.
5405140	5406140	No, it's just my...
5406140	5407140	Oh, what the fuck?
5407140	5409140	I'm so done with the asking for cookies.
5412140	5413140	What's my birthday?
5414140	5415140	September 28th.
5417140	5418140	September 28th.
5427140	5429140	Oh, I have to check a verification code.
5429140	5430140	Fuck me.
5448140	5449140	Please choose an account name.
5452140	5453140	Hold on.
5453140	5454140	I need a cool name.
5455140	5456140	Guys, help me pick a name.
5458140	5459140	Can you guys help me think of a name?
5461140	5463140	Stanley Parable is running through Portal 2.
5463140	5464140	Oh, is it?
5466140	5467140	Why do I look so demonic?
5469140	5470140	Why are my eyes just like...
5472140	5475140	The child in yellow, whatever that game is called.
5478140	5479140	Help me think of a cool name.
5480140	5482140	I need a cool badass name for RuneScape.
5485140	5486140	Oh, wait.
5486140	5487140	Does it matter if I have a username?
5490140	5492140	And then I just make a character name.
5492140	5493140	Is the username different from the character name?
5495140	5496140	Not Sheebie.
5497140	5498140	The Sheedmeister.
5500140	5501140	Mr. Siappet.
5503140	5505140	Darkened McOrphan Pain.
5508140	5509140	Sheebie Detroit.
5510140	5511140	No, Ben.
5513140	5514140	Get destroyed.
5517140	5519140	Remove yourself from the premises.
5522140	5523140	Terrible.
5525140	5526140	Shubby.
5528140	5530140	The Sheebie Parable.
5532140	5534140	Baroness, cotton bum.
5535140	5536140	Hold on.
5536140	5538140	Let's do this for my account name.
5546140	5548140	Why is that not allowed?
5562140	5563140	Serious?
5564140	5567140	Why is this name not allowed?
5571140	5572140	Oh my god.
5588140	5590140	Wait, I forgot how to spell Mistress.
5593140	5594140	What?
5598140	5599140	That's what works.
5599140	5600140	Are you serious?
5602140	5604140	It wouldn't let me do Sheebie Cotton Bum
5605140	5606140	or Sheebie Cotton.
5610140	5613140	It wouldn't let me do Cotton or Sheebie.
5613140	5614140	I don't...
5624140	5626140	Wait, I have to download the game?
5634140	5636140	I just want to play Old School RuneScape.
5639140	5641140	I thought that was a game you just play in the window.
5649140	5650140	I'm literally gonna cry.
5653140	5654140	Can you...
5656140	5659140	I'm gonna strangle their webpage
5659140	5661140	because this is not loading.
5663140	5664140	Okay, Cotton.
5664140	5665140	Yeah, but like...
5669140	5670140	Oh.
5675140	5677140	There's almost 200 people on this.
5681140	5682140	On this game.
5683140	5685140	Come on, I just want to play RuneScape.
5686140	5687140	I'm gonna strangle too.
5693140	5694140	Holy crap.
5699140	5701140	You created a new character for me.
5701140	5702140	Lovely.
5703140	5704140	Create.
5710140	5711140	Manage.
5713140	5715140	Why is this so confusing?
5716140	5717140	What is...
5717140	5718140	Am I dumb?
5720140	5721140	Wait, I have to get to...
5721140	5722140	Okay, I'm done. Never mind then.
5722140	5724140	If I have to do the tutorials and everything
5724140	5727140	and I just can't go and just like try to kill Strawny as a joke
5727140	5729140	or like try to flirt with her or something
5729140	5731140	and be a cringe
5732140	5733140	then I'm not dumb enough.
5733140	5735140	I'll do that later then.
5740140	5742140	Tutorial, I could speedrun through it?
5742140	5743140	No.
5744140	5745140	It was all fine.
5748140	5749140	We're just gonna raid...
5750140	5751140	Just gonna raid mom.
5753140	5754140	We're just gonna raid mom.
5754140	5756140	I don't know why I'm so tired.
5758140	5761140	Maybe because I didn't go to sleep till 1am again.
5761140	5763140	Then I woke up at 6am.
5766140	5767140	I'm not the best bunny.
5768140	5770140	I'm a bad bunny.
5770140	5772140	Are you seeing bad bunny?
5776140	5777140	Wait.
5781140	5783140	Hold on, let me see who's streaming.
5785140	5786140	I see the...
5787140	5788140	Hold on.
5788140	5789140	Hold on.
5798140	5799140	Hold on.
5805140	5806140	God!
5808140	5809140	Too many windows open!
5812140	5813140	Strawny it is.
5819140	5820140	Alright.
5822140	5823140	Later nerds.
5823140	5824140	I'm gonna go in a...
5825140	5826140	Emen Hera somewhere.
5826140	5827140	Somewhere else.
5832140	5834140	So I apologize for the scuff.
5835140	5836140	But um...
5836140	5837140	I think you know.
5837140	5838140	It's just you know...
5839140	5840140	It's a part of me.
5840140	5841140	I was born with it.
5841140	5842140	I was molded by the scuff.
5844140	5845140	And my internet keeps changing.
5845140	5846140	I love you.
5846140	5847140	Bye!
5847140	5848140	No I don't.
5848140	5849140	I don't fucking love you.
5850140	5851140	Don't get the fucking head.
5851140	5852140	Fuck you.
