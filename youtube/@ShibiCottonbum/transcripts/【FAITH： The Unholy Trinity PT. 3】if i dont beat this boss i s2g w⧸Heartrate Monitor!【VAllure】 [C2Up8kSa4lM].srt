Bonjour

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,480
How are you

18
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:42,480
How are y'all doing today?

19
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,480
It's me baby

20
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,520
and I'm return time

21
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:55,520
I think it's only fair I dress as a as bb for for faith I don't go back of my little shawl on though

22
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:04,960
I'm just too lazy um wow I haven't seen you guys in quite a bit it's been a moment um I hope you guys

23
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:14,000
are doing well what the heck was that wheeze I just did um how I accidentally just like poke

24
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:22,400
myself in the eye trying to fix my glasses you know just just pawn pawn girl things um

25
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:31,120
my life revolves around shimmy streams and I'm here for it make sure you go outside and touch press

26
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,800
honestly I won't lie to you I think the best thing for me these past couple days has been going to

27
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,680
my mom's house and watering her plants and just getting outside um because I really have been

28
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,520
mostly inside um a lot of the the year and even at my job like there wasn't any windows

29
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,800
well okay hi boomi there wasn't any windows at my job so I couldn't see out toward

30
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:04,080
I was you know I was sequestered away from the sunlight um because they're taking boomi for walks

31
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:11,280
yeah so I think I actually just like might like ask my mom if um if I can just like come over in

32
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:17,920
the morning and hang out with her sometimes I am gonna see her what's today Thursday I'm gonna see

33
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:25,280
her um probably tomorrow and hang out my parents Friday and Saturday just because I told my mama

34
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:32,240
how I've been feeling because I've been sick and I've been kind of just like um just getting bummed

35
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:38,960
out from stuff so I am you know revitalizing my energy by hanging out with my parents yeah I've

36
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:45,840
been really uh meeting it up I was I've got my house is so messy it's really bad like I

37
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,640
I need to sweep I need to clean there's food I have to do the dishes there's so much crap everywhere

38
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:58,640
but I'm secretly super happy because I finally managed to get my whiteboard up because I kept

39
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:06,480
falling down and then I got uh command strips that support 15 pounds and now it finally works um

40
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:15,040
um yeah I definitely I'm like I'm my model is like going probably freezing because I'm looking

41
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:20,480
behind me at my house and I'm just disappointed in myself my clothes are everywhere I'm just

42
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,320
throwing things everywhere and then I I always say like your living space is a usually reflection

43
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:33,840
of your mental and my mental must be very messy right now and cluttered um I got fia next to me

44
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:42,080
she's big chilling hi she's big chilling she's big chilling oh she's trying to come and lick me

45
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:48,240
you got I got her new litter and it like I don't think I like it they didn't have the litter I wanted

46
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:56,960
I got like pretty litter um but I don't I hope it just doesn't stick to her when she's the bathroom

47
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,680
that's why I usually get paper litter for her um

48
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,480
I remember her hair we had this cat hair everywhere it's probably the reason why I've been sick is

49
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,680
because like there's dust and so and there's just like trash like there's still there's a crap on my

50
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:19,840
desk and I'm just like I'm gonna go crazy so I like my new to clean um can you have a hug of

51
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:27,200
course you can he's a hug um do you ever live like this in fact Batman and sonic posters

52
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:35,760
in your office impressive um something sounds like you gave some of the plants and the plants gave

53
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:43,520
something back 100 um oh I actually asked my mom what those plants were uh the flowers that I took

54
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:52,560
it was a I'll tell you right now that's funny because um Dempo actually guessed one of them

55
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:01,440
uh it was verbena which was the white one and then there was this type of sunflower

56
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,320
and then the rose of Sharon was the yellow rose I could I like I had a feeling and then of course

57
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:13,440
Adalia was the pink one um I planted I planted that one I I made that flower my mom just keeps

58
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:20,560
it alive um but I planted all the dahlias and my mom's garden which was a pretty cool to see them live

59
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,720
um because my mom has a really good green thumb and I do not I kill all the plants I touch besides

60
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:32,640
the monstera it's actually doing okay I need to get like stakes for it though because it it's so big

61
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,200
it needs something to hold itself up I need to get like twine and then I have another philodendron

62
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,520
except it's just a regular philodendron above my right next to my desk probably have to water it soon

63
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:48,960
yeah definitely have to water it um wait do I have any water in this usually I was dumping old water

64
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:57,040
no I can't I'm not putting that that's I still have the dry I still have the dry ice water on my

65
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:05,280
desk that's that's how messy these stuff is um but yeah and then I feel I just I finally

66
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,640
I did like my schedule like two weeks out and I have it all up on the board

67
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:17,760
and then I put it on our schedule thingy and I'm just trying to be more organized um I'm probably

68
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:23,360
also gonna start taking another day off because I realize you know my normal day off is Sunday

69
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,800
and everything's closed on Sunday so I'm gonna probably do like Thursdays moving forward um

70
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:38,800
I'll also like take off to like get stuff done record um like do like doctor's appointments and

71
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:46,160
stuff um just so I feel like I think I need to pace myself uh although me doing two streams a day

72
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:54,800
I just can't um get enough of you guys I suppose um but yeah so but like don't think I'm gonna like

73
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:02,880
like two streams a day wouldn't happen like I I've really just been doing gorillas for the um

74
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,920
for Elden Ring the DLC as I want to and when I'm in the mood for playing Elden Ring then I'll just

75
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:16,000
do a double stream but don't think like that like gorillas are going to like that like two streams

76
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,520
a day are going to be a regular thing I can't handle that I'd rather do an endurance stream um

77
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:27,760
because I realized I actually get more tired starting a stream than ending a stream um rather

78
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:36,160
than just continuing to stream I know it's very it's very interesting um but yeah I need a week

79
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:42,960
day off to get things done um I'm also cleaning up my marshmallow I just cleaned up a lot of stuff

80
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:50,080
um it's still still kind of being cleaned up um but I I'm open to marshmallows again

81
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:57,920
there is like a lot of stuff in there um positive and negative but um mostly positive but I just

82
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:03,920
wanted to if I didn't respond I'm sorry but you know I saw it um but there was a like 600

83
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:10,720
maros in there so I I just needed to clear them out it was like really like I was kind of like

84
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:19,760
getting super like um like I like would freeze every time like and then just like that I was

85
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,000
overwhelmed with the thought of like answering all of them and like kind of going through so I just

86
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,720
I wanted to clean it up a little bit um so I had management go through it and clean it up for me

87
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:37,920
which I appreciate um don't worry they didn't like look at anything they just like ran something to

88
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:46,400
remove stuff which is I thought was pretty neat um but yeah uh so then you guys can um just because

89
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:52,960
since I'm not looking at my um alt account or I'm not obsessively tweeting every hour of the day

90
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:59,840
and I'm not looking at uh the threads I'm just um I haven't looked at them since I said I wouldn't

91
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:09,920
so you guys can like just say hi uh or like um leave me a message or leave some advice and

92
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:15,920
all that stuff but still you know feel better about you know being anonymous and everything um

93
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:25,040
but yeah I'm again I'm probably I might not respond to everything but I will try to read every

94
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:30,640
marshmallow they can just get really overwhelming sometimes with the volume that gets sent in which

95
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:36,400
I never really anticipated before but I'm very um thankful you guys you know want to talk to me

96
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:43,920
don't think I don't want to talk to you it's mostly just like um uh it's it's not you it's me

97
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:50,560
so I might just get overwhelmed I may not respond right away but I'll try to respond to as many as

98
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:58,000
I can but please understand it's a little bit difficult um please don't pressure me or get

99
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:06,000
mad if I can't respond as much as I did in the very beginning um yeah it's like it was like a

100
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:14,320
it was a lot um but yeah so today has been a good day I'm really glad that you guys enjoyed the ASMR

134
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:28,000
gonna be later than I was but it was fine let's take off my little flip flop hello I'm doing fine

135
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,840
um as you can see I have the heart rate up it's right above my head I might put it in a different

136
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:42,000
spot I don't know maybe I'll just like it looks like I'm wearing glasses that actually doesn't

137
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:49,200
look that bad little tiny glasses I don't know is that was there fine maybe we'll figure it out I

138
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:57,360
just wanted to be visible little glasses wait can I give myself little glasses but I really

139
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:04,480
enjoyed doing the ASMR today honestly I won't lie to you I I never really did ASMR that much

140
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:15,920
because I was so self-conscious of my um sound in my audio settings and so it was kind of difficult

141
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:22,960
for me um not that I didn't enjoy doing ASMR it it's just that it was like I was so it was so

142
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:34,400
self-conscious oh guys come on that looks pretty damn good I wish I had like little little bifocals

143
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,480
I should have a monocle

144
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,000
but um

145
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:56,240
but yeah perfect granny sheebie I it's funny when I used to I used to have like more rectangular

146
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,560
framed glasses and I used to always look over them at my parents and my parents would make fun of me

147

00:25:54,480 --> 00:26:04,400
double up on streams um like strani does for members I would love to match like match her freak

I should do that as a stream how would all of my gen mates and myself yab and then like

207
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:51,440
yab scrawny is exposed for not having an ass

208
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:59,040
I would say a media is exposed for having big tatas but we already know that she does

209
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:05,280
um yab I see secretly isn't russian

210
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:14,880
but you already did sing bonfire I did I I can remember

211
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:23,920
can start a stream and yab about anything like I see and yeah why are you guys keep saying

212
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:32,000

218
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:08,160
I forget where her accent is from she says she speaks russian so I'm just assuming she has a russian accent

219
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,560
I thought yab actually meant something so I'll tell you if you don't know what a yab is

220
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:20,400
it's just like an off-sing term in a v2 bring community means it means just like you kind of

00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,800
you just mess up and you just you essentially just yeah kind of just like make a really big

222
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:33,600

242
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,560
she's at school right now

243
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:40,480
the fashion roblox I had to introduce myself in class and I threw up but held it in so it

244
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:58,800
all came out of my nose nice why does this have almost 10k views

245
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:07,600
I cannot with her she is she's a goof she is truly a goof

246
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:17,440
I'm a champ yeah that's not even a yab though I said I'm a pokemon smash or pass people got mad

247
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:25,120
because I said I would smash my champ and they were threatened because they compared him to a

248
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:34,160
black man and I was so confused by that oh so there's an audio that goes with the picture

249
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:39,840
Amy posted right there was um I don't know what happened to it I don't know if she um I don't

250
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:46,160
know if she's gonna post it or anything I have to ask her about it um because I saw the the image

251
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:51,680
and I was like oh oh which is the audio so I went on Amy's account and see if she posted the audio

252
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:59,520
but uh it looks like she didn't do it um I was based off of uh because I know a lot of people liked

253
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,200
um

254
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,240
I'm like should I use code names or should I just use their real name I really don't care

255
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:19,200
uh Rifu and Kiki's audio they made together um and so that's um what me and Amy recorded something

256
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:28,320
similar um and uh and that's where and that's when I've actually talked about it before it was

257
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:34,160
like a couple weeks ago that me and Amy were working on something in call and we figured out we could

258
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:41,040
record um and so like user microphones and discord as we use them for audacity or whatever I don't

259
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:48,880
know what recording thing she uses I just use audacity and so um and so I got to hear uh Amy

260
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:55,760
live recording and I'm like whoa is this what your patreon is like I understand now

261
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:05,440
um but yeah I don't know I can just ask her uh in fact I love the art it was so good I was like

262
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:11,200
I like me some Buddha uh let me message her right now

263
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:23,520
hi I have people asking in my chat on stream

264
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:35,520
if the if the audio is going up with the picture you do

265
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,360
boop boop boop boop boop boop yeah you guys would like it a lot

266
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:55,760
at least I hope you would I hope you just remember you're not allowed to what

267
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:03,520
what why are you guys sweating what's happening why are you guys bonking

268
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:15,280
I'm confused members are banned oh oh yeah

269
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:23,360
yo yeah so you would listen to it and you would just suck it would just suck for you

270
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:32,320
couldn't even do anything whoa I don't because it's not me

271
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:42,960
are you kidding me right now you wouldn't because it's not you do a lot of you share that sentiment

272
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:50,480
would you would you want the audio or would you not

273
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:59,920
it's a joke oh okay I got really scared for a second I'm like oh because I don't want to

274
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:05,440
I self-insert as in as you should as you should

275
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:17,360
maybe she's no I we all know I have a terrible memory and I am forgetful we already established

276
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:24,320
this earlier um but yeah okay I just want to make sure because I wouldn't want anyone to be

277
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:29,440
bothered by that because I know some people didn't like some of the collab audios um

278
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:36,640
strong you was telling us and stuff uh because they it's it's harder for like self-insert and

279
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:44,640
stuff so I would I would hope that you guys well the forgetting emo is literally the like dial up

280
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:53,440
the dial up wow uh the like that's how that's the sound I hear the dial up sound yeah that one

281
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,160
the loading that I hear dial up when I see that

282
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:05,680
um the reaction on twitter was positive yeah I like collab audios but you know people don't like

283
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:12,400
like if the majority don't like them then of course yeah somebody mentioned um and they had a really

284
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:21,520
good point that uh it was because it like they would prefer like four audios each month for

285
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:28,080
patreon of the single talent and then meet like then a bonus one because they they don't want

286
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:41,840
them to take up a spot and I was like okay don't change I get that um I think most you would

287
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,320
use them out though yeah I feel like it might be a little split

288
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:52,400
collab audios on patreon are not the same thing as free stuff on twitter yeah that's a good point

289
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:57,360
as well if you pay for four of the talent then I like it like that's why I'm like okay I understand

290
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:01,440
and then if you get like a bonus audio and it's a collab then that's pretty neat so

291
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,960
maybe maybe we could still do uh collab audio so we'll just have them as a little bonus um

292
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:15,920
um yeah because I know like for my donathan I have some collab audio things just like Azura did um

293
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,760
so I hope that you guys would like them because they wanted to be worth your while of course

294
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:27,040
fun fact she beat the loading symbols called a what ankyl me

295
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:32,000
yeah I yeah yeah

296
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,760
I was going to use your subscriber both patreon and collab audio meaning like seven hours one

297
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:44,720
so yeah yeah see like I get that yeah but like I think I think that's already been kind of like

298
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:49,120
sorted out so like I could just bring up to strongy like hey maybe be a good idea to add a bonus

299
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:54,960
audio if like the girls are up to it um every once in a while and I think I think the girls would be

300
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:59,520
down um just so yeah self-insert is in me so she beat

301
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:11,760
oh yeah I know the art is really good I was like hey oh um that's so funny I didn't know that um

302
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:16,480
but yeah I still need to when you get those scripts done I need to record them and so I can send

303
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:21,600
them off to the audio editor I still got plenty of time it's only the fifth but like I like to

304
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:27,840
do stuff early so I don't have to worry about it later because like um like I did my audios later

305
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:34,880
um last month and I'm not I wasn't stressed out but I'm like I prefer to do the ASAP um and then

306
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:40,000
I still have I'm getting my scripts written for November and December they're still in the writing

307
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:45,920
phases and then I'll bang those out real quick to be fair the azure collab audio is about twice

308
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:50,560
as long as your tip of audio so I wouldn't feel like I got one fewer audio for what I paid true

309
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:58,880
true oh wow fia is dreaming hardcore she's twitching it's very funny um but yeah

310
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,120
sorry I'm doing a lot of zatsu because um I just want to make sure you guys are good

311
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:14,080
I keep forgetting well none of the chat freaking works it doesn't work maybe I'll add a chat window

312
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:19,360
instead what if I do this I might have to start popping out the chat because since it keeps freezing

313
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:28,320
and then putting the chat up just so vaude watchers I'm so sorry vaude watchers I know it's

314
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:35,280
probably a lot easier for you to follow when you can see what the chat is saying um so I apologize for

315
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,120
that

316
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:47,040
where is the where is the chat window

317
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:52,720
I don't see it

318
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,880
is it invisible

319
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,920
where's the chat window this is not there

320
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:14,720
if I I don't want to freeze again that weird glitch okay

321
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:20,560
so

322
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,560
youtube has chat replay yeah but sometimes it doesn't work

323
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:36,080
wait I need to make the chat window a little bit

324
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:48,240
wait why isn't it letting me change the uh oh whatever it's fine

325
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,480
it's just gonna be one line

326
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,920
yeah chat replay disappears if I edit the vaude not that I edit the vaude a lot

327
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:13,920
you guys are gonna be up there doing whatever I don't know or I can have you over my booba

Oh, you know what I just remembered I have an uncrustle wool.

451
01:01:57,340 --> 01:02:05,100
All I read today is two egg, boiled eggs, some cut apples, some grapes, some sliced

452
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:20,660
salami, some cheese and some crackers, and some pickles.

453
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:30,620
Oh it's mine, you can't have any.

454
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:49,500
My heart rate goes up when I eat an uncrustle wool.

455
01:02:49,500 --> 01:03:05,380
Not even a crumb, excuse me, oh mine, oh wait what am I doing, I'm pressing the wrong

456
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:19,140
buttons, I was pressing S and D, I wasn't, I was pressing the wrong bookies.

457
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:34,340
Oh am I right, die.

458
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:38,980
Okay I don't think I'm gonna keep this guy alive, I don't really care anymore, oh I'm

459
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:48,660
dead, mortis, yeah I don't, I don't really care that much about him anymore.

460
01:03:48,660 --> 01:04:07,860
Where are you going, I really should back up when you yell like that.

461
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:12,060
I want it, sorry I was looking at chat, I wanted to save Father Garcia but the reason

462
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:18,180
why I keep dying is because of him so I don't really, I can't do it bros I'm sorry I'm

463
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:31,500
just not strong enough, I'm not cool enough, I'm not much of a gamer.

464
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:46,700
Why are you so close?

465
01:04:46,700 --> 01:05:10,340
Oh my god, cuz she goes for him and I can't save his ass, yeah see like I can't, cuz

466
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:32,940
if she spawns close to him there's really nothing I can do about it.

467
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:44,140
Oh my god.

468
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:54,980
Why isn't she dead yet, like this is what I mean.

469
01:05:54,980 --> 01:05:58,540
She just so you know when he's flashing near Garcia I mean she'll attack him, you have

470
01:05:58,540 --> 01:06:11,380
to show her the cross before she does, oh thank you, flashing near Garcia I mean she'll

471
01:06:11,380 --> 01:06:28,740
attack him, okay.

472
01:06:28,740 --> 01:06:51,100
I'll try to see if I know what you mean.

473
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:52,100
Frick.

474
01:06:52,460 --> 01:07:01,380
Father Garcia why did you walk, have to walk into a line of fire.

475
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:03,660
Alright let's try this.

476
01:07:03,660 --> 01:07:06,660
Nevermind.

477
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:28,100
Why are you so close?

478
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:33,100
Why are you on my footy cheeks?

479
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:51,780
Oh my god, oh my god she almost fucking walked into me, I'm flashing, oh I was standing right

480
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:54,860
on top of her.

481
01:07:54,860 --> 01:08:02,540
I know what to do but I like to call it a her, cuz it looks like a girl to me, it looks

482
01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:17,260
like an evil lady, she looks and she screams like an evil lady, oh okay I see what you

483
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:23,540
mean.

484
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:30,220
Frickin speed racer over here, I'm still in the wrong way.

485
01:08:30,220 --> 01:08:39,740
She kind of bad though, she kind of a mommy.

486
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:46,860
Back up, back up, back up, back up, back off my brother.

487
01:08:46,860 --> 01:09:11,500
Back up, oh my god, Jesus fricking Christ, hello, no be gone, be gone thought, oh my

I didn't think she was, oh it is a girl, I told you guys it's a girl, somebody said

494
01:10:42,980 --> 01:10:52,900
like I don't know when she's gonna die, I don't, I don't know when she's gonna, like is it three

495
01:10:52,900 --> 01:11:03,380
times I have to do like the whole rigamarole, but it's like I know this is the third phase,

496
01:11:03,380 --> 01:11:10,020
I'm talking about like how many times do I have to try to kill her, third phase, she ran at me,

497
01:11:10,580 --> 01:11:18,180
I did this for like two hours last time I played,

498
01:11:18,180 --> 01:11:30,260
can you, oh my god, stop, oh my god,

499
01:11:40,180 --> 01:11:44,340
oh god, I forget she starts at the top,

500
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:58,980
oh my god,

501
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:02,260
why are you just running at me like that,

502
01:12:08,340 --> 01:12:09,780
hail,

503
01:12:17,940 --> 01:12:20,260
oh god, okay, she starts at the top,

504
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:38,740
okay, no, every time, every time, bro, it's the last phase, I know that's probably the last one,

505
01:12:43,380 --> 01:12:45,700
it's probably the last one, that's what I keep dying on,

506
01:12:45,860 --> 01:12:54,340
I need to move up instead of down perhaps, oh, what, I thought I started with you,

507
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:58,180
she running, she running,

508
01:12:59,060 --> 01:13:04,660
oh, oh, sorry for your squeaks and that threw me off,

509
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:20,820

510
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:27,060
oh, big stretch, let me stretch your legies, oh, big stretch the legies,

511
01:13:38,020 --> 01:13:42,820
sorry it's my cat, oh you're so cute here,

512
01:13:42,820 --> 01:13:44,820

513
01:13:51,780 --> 01:13:58,020
all right, all right, all right, let's do this, walking in as I die, like right off the bat,

514
01:14:02,260 --> 01:14:07,700
Mike, hello, yeah, I was like, why am I not, I was just pointed at every one and it wasn't pointing,

515
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:12,420
oh, bitch,

516
01:14:18,260 --> 01:14:21,540
please, I'm trying to point, I'm pointing down,

517
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:32,740
okay,

518
01:14:37,700 --> 01:14:50,260
oh, please,

519
01:14:57,380 --> 01:14:57,700
okay,

520
01:14:57,700 --> 01:15:05,700
okay,

521
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:08,660
is that a glitch, why does it do that, nope, oh,

522
01:15:08,660 --> 01:15:24,020
bitch,

523
01:15:34,420 --> 01:15:36,020
let's go,

524
01:15:38,660 --> 01:16:00,660
Finally, finally, finally, Fia, thank you for your strength.

525
01:16:00,660 --> 01:16:01,660
Thank you.

526
01:16:01,660 --> 01:16:04,660
Oh, oh, what are you doing?

527
01:16:05,660 --> 01:16:09,660
She really just, like, lovingly placed her paw on my forehead.

528
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:11,660
Like, my child.

529
01:16:14,660 --> 01:16:16,660
Fia buff is real.

530
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:18,660
Fia the lifebed companion.

531
01:16:18,660 --> 01:16:20,660
Yeah, little girl.

532
01:16:23,660 --> 01:16:25,660
You get extra scratches.

533
01:16:27,660 --> 01:16:28,660
Blast.

534
01:16:29,660 --> 01:16:31,660
Oh, wait, no.

535
01:16:31,660 --> 01:16:33,660
Hold on, hold on.

536
01:16:34,660 --> 01:16:38,660
Let me, let me fix myself.

537
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:41,660
Oops.

538
01:16:44,660 --> 01:16:47,660
Oh, I'm in, like, a lot of pain today and I don't know why.

539
01:16:51,660 --> 01:16:53,660
Let me see if I can put this hand dress back on.

540
01:16:55,660 --> 01:16:57,660
Ah, look at me, look at me.

541
01:16:57,660 --> 01:16:58,660
I am the nun now.

542
01:16:58,660 --> 01:16:59,660
I am the nun.

543
01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:08,660
Oh, sorry, my mole flew off my face.

544
01:17:19,660 --> 01:17:21,660
Heroge freckles.

545
01:17:26,660 --> 01:17:29,660
Why does this suck to when I blink?

546
01:17:30,660 --> 01:17:32,660
What is it doing?

547
01:17:32,660 --> 01:17:35,660
Every time I blink, it twitches.

548
01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:40,660
Oh, my, what is that?

549
01:17:42,660 --> 01:17:43,660
Help.

550
01:17:53,660 --> 01:17:55,660
Okay, it doesn't twitch as much now.

551
01:17:55,660 --> 01:17:57,660
Okay, we're fine, we're fine, we're fine.

552
01:17:57,660 --> 01:18:00,660
Whew, whew, unless I move a lot.

553
01:18:02,660 --> 01:18:03,660
Okay.

554
01:18:12,660 --> 01:18:13,660
Okay.

555
01:18:16,660 --> 01:18:18,660
Why do I keep wheezing when I left?

556
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:21,660
What the frick is wrong with me?

557
01:18:22,660 --> 01:18:24,660
It's not cute, it's not cute at all.

558
01:18:25,660 --> 01:18:27,660
It's not cute.

559
01:18:27,660 --> 01:18:29,660
It's not it, it's not it, babes.

560
01:18:30,660 --> 01:18:32,660
The habit looks like this.

561
01:18:32,660 --> 01:18:35,660
You're saying my habits stiff?

562
01:18:37,660 --> 01:18:39,660
Your twitch when they blink.

563
01:18:47,660 --> 01:18:48,660
It's in there.

564
01:18:50,660 --> 01:18:51,660
All right.

565
01:18:59,660 --> 01:19:01,660
Would have loved to read that.

566
01:19:06,660 --> 01:19:09,660
Oh, God, I wonder what it said.

567
01:19:24,660 --> 01:19:25,660
It's clavis.

568
01:19:30,660 --> 01:19:34,660
Sorry, that's how I open doors.

569
01:19:36,660 --> 01:19:37,660
Why not?

570
01:19:39,660 --> 01:19:41,660
Wait, can I go into this room then?

571
01:19:46,660 --> 01:19:48,660
Clavis is key.

572
01:19:48,660 --> 01:19:50,660
Well, I figured that out.

573
01:19:50,660 --> 01:19:52,660
I meant like, what does it go to?

574
01:19:53,660 --> 01:19:58,660
John, it's not too late.

575
01:19:58,660 --> 01:20:01,660
Your soul can still be saved.

576
01:20:01,660 --> 01:20:03,660
All is not lost.

577
01:20:03,660 --> 01:20:04,660
Just kidding.

578
01:20:04,660 --> 01:20:05,660
Let me.

579
01:20:13,660 --> 01:20:17,660
John, it is not too late.

580
01:20:17,660 --> 01:20:20,660
Your soul can still be saved.

581
01:20:20,660 --> 01:20:22,660
All is not lost.

582
01:20:23,660 --> 01:20:25,660
Please wait for my next letter.

583
01:20:25,660 --> 01:20:29,660
For now, I have many questions that need answering.

584
01:20:30,660 --> 01:20:33,660
In the meantime, be careful.

585
01:20:33,660 --> 01:20:35,660
I am watching you.

586
01:20:39,660 --> 01:20:41,660
There's still a little bit of hard tune on that.

587
01:20:41,660 --> 01:20:43,660
Lipsies, turn the echo down.

588
01:20:51,660 --> 01:20:52,660
Oh.

589
01:20:56,660 --> 01:20:59,660
But did I really do the right thing?

590
01:21:01,660 --> 01:21:03,660
Forget TikTok voices.

591
01:21:03,660 --> 01:21:05,660
Get these voices on TikTok.

592
01:21:08,660 --> 01:21:09,660
The boys?

593
01:21:09,660 --> 01:21:11,660
Oh, I, I, Omeland has got my son.

594
01:21:14,660 --> 01:21:16,660
The boys, aren't they dead already?

595
01:21:21,660 --> 01:21:24,660
Is this dude following me?

596
01:21:33,660 --> 01:21:34,660
Fun.

597
01:21:40,660 --> 01:21:42,660
I like how it boots up like that.

598
01:21:42,660 --> 01:21:47,660
That's what, um, I'm pretty sure like inscription uses some of the same sound effects.

599
01:21:51,660 --> 01:21:54,660
Chapter three.

600
01:21:58,660 --> 01:22:00,660
What does show needles mean?

601
01:22:07,660 --> 01:22:09,660
Is that Billy Butcher?

602
01:22:09,660 --> 01:22:21,660
I forget that I have to press it twice.

603
01:22:21,660 --> 01:22:23,660
I'm just like, why is it loading?

604
01:22:32,660 --> 01:22:35,660
September 21st, 1986.

605
01:22:40,660 --> 01:22:45,660
What?

606
01:22:48,660 --> 01:22:51,660
Why is everything muffled hello?

607
01:22:55,660 --> 01:22:57,660
Is this your first exorcism?

608
01:22:57,660 --> 01:22:59,660
Yes, sir.

609
01:23:00,660 --> 01:23:02,660
Are you afraid?

610
01:23:03,660 --> 01:23:05,660
I don't know, sir.

611
01:23:06,660 --> 01:23:09,660
That's daddy to you.

612
01:23:10,660 --> 01:23:13,660
I'll give you a word of advice, champ.

613
01:23:13,660 --> 01:23:16,660
Follow my instructions with exactness.

614
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:21,660
Don't trust me when you may say you're here.

615
01:23:27,660 --> 01:23:32,660
Cause I'm a man, but there's everything good on it.

616
01:23:32,660 --> 01:23:35,660
Looks like his dinglings between his legs.

617
01:23:40,660 --> 01:23:42,660
The rotoscope is just so good.

618
01:23:42,660 --> 01:23:44,660
He's wearing sunglasses.

619
01:23:45,660 --> 01:23:47,660
Good evening.

620
01:23:47,660 --> 01:23:50,660
This is my assistant for the world.

621
01:23:50,660 --> 01:23:53,660
I'm suddenly from the Sorks family.

622
01:23:53,660 --> 01:23:54,660
Shall we begin?

623
01:23:54,660 --> 01:23:56,660
You know, I don't have to bother voice acting.

624
01:23:56,660 --> 01:23:57,660
You guys can read.

625
01:23:57,660 --> 01:23:59,660
Hi, lady.

626
01:24:02,660 --> 01:24:04,660
Hi, lady.

627
01:24:09,660 --> 01:24:12,660
Oh, I just got a fucking shiver.

628
01:24:20,660 --> 01:24:22,660
Damn.

629
01:24:22,660 --> 01:24:24,660
Why don't you say so?

630
01:24:26,660 --> 01:24:28,660
I guess I'll go first.

631
01:24:32,660 --> 01:24:35,660
No, she's just doing TikTok dances and she doesn't stop.

632
01:24:35,660 --> 01:24:37,660
Hey.

633
01:24:39,660 --> 01:24:41,660
You see that, bro?

634
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:44,660
Wait, again, the thing with...

635
01:24:44,660 --> 01:24:48,660
She's in the attic and they get brought to the basement.

636
01:24:48,660 --> 01:24:50,660
It's so weird to me.

637
01:24:50,660 --> 01:24:52,660
I still don't get that.

638
01:24:53,660 --> 01:24:55,660
Da, da, da, da, da.

639
01:24:58,660 --> 01:25:02,660
Oh, got anything to say about that, Father Garcia?

640
01:25:06,660 --> 01:25:08,660
Hey, queen.

641
01:25:08,660 --> 01:25:10,660
That's my cat.

642
01:25:39,660 --> 01:25:45,660
He wakes up besides Father Garcia.

643
01:26:01,660 --> 01:26:03,660
John, we don't have much time.

644
01:26:03,660 --> 01:26:06,660
The profane Sabbath is almost upon us.

645
01:26:06,660 --> 01:26:09,660
If they find Nate and Jason, they will perform a ritual on them

646
01:26:09,660 --> 01:26:12,660
to call forth the demon of unspeakable power.

647
01:26:12,660 --> 01:26:15,660
The name of the demon is Malfas.

648
01:26:15,660 --> 01:26:18,660
I'm in the process of discovering their whereabouts.

649
01:26:18,660 --> 01:26:20,660
I will contact you again soon.

650
01:26:20,660 --> 01:26:24,660
We must not let them do to the boys what they did to Amy.

651
01:26:26,660 --> 01:26:28,660
Oh, I forgot I have to go down.

652
01:26:28,660 --> 01:26:32,660
Going down, down, in an early and round.

653
01:26:33,660 --> 01:26:36,660
Why don't I go in the fun room?

654
01:26:39,660 --> 01:26:42,660
I was just walking by it, but go off this.

655
01:26:46,660 --> 01:26:50,660
John, I can't find Nate or Jason Martin in the state foster care system.

656
01:26:50,660 --> 01:26:52,660
It's...wait.

657
01:26:52,660 --> 01:26:53,660
Wait a second.

658
01:26:53,660 --> 01:26:55,660
So you're telling me...

659
01:26:55,660 --> 01:26:57,660
I thought Amy...

660
01:26:57,660 --> 01:27:00,660
I thought Nate and Jason were Amy's younger brothers

661
01:27:00,660 --> 01:27:04,660
because the lady was talking about how she had twins and a baby

662
01:27:04,660 --> 01:27:07,660
and I thought that was their mother, whatever.

663
01:27:07,660 --> 01:27:11,660
It's possible after what happened last year they went to live with relatives.

664
01:27:11,660 --> 01:27:13,660
I will try to find out what I can.

665
01:27:13,660 --> 01:27:15,660
Meanwhile, go investigate the clinic where Amy worked.

666
01:27:15,660 --> 01:27:18,660
We must find the place where they intend to summon Malfas

667
01:27:18,660 --> 01:27:22,660
and disrupt their plans via Condius, Father Garcia.

668
01:27:24,660 --> 01:27:27,660
I can't do a Spanish accent, so if I did, it would just sound bad.

669
01:27:31,660 --> 01:27:32,660
I am right.

670
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:33,660
Okay.

671
01:27:36,660 --> 01:27:37,660
I want to see the new exorcist movie.

672
01:27:37,660 --> 01:27:38,660
Was that good?

673
01:27:38,660 --> 01:27:40,660
Did anybody see that?

674
01:27:40,660 --> 01:27:41,660
What was it called?

675
01:27:41,660 --> 01:27:42,660
Deliverance?

676
01:27:42,660 --> 01:27:44,660
Have you forgotten already?

677
01:27:44,660 --> 01:27:46,660
Things are never quite as I see.

678
01:27:46,660 --> 01:27:48,660
If you can't discern truth from lies,

679
01:27:48,660 --> 01:27:51,660
you could try remembering what you know to be true.

680
01:27:51,660 --> 01:27:55,660
Press escape or the star button to review your notes, bitch.

681
01:27:55,660 --> 01:27:57,660
Sure, thank you.

682
01:27:58,660 --> 01:28:00,660
What's in the fridge?

683
01:28:00,660 --> 01:28:02,660
Anything outside?

684
01:28:11,660 --> 01:28:13,660
Sorry, I'm trying to jump off the stairs.

685
01:28:19,660 --> 01:28:21,660
I don't like this.

686
01:28:21,660 --> 01:28:24,660
I don't like this one bit.

687
01:28:28,660 --> 01:28:33,660
I think I definitely will have to watch a lore video on this.

688
01:28:33,660 --> 01:28:37,660
Because I love me some lore.

689
01:28:37,660 --> 01:28:39,660
The lore.

690
01:28:46,660 --> 01:28:48,660
It's not the same without MatPat.

691
01:28:48,660 --> 01:28:50,660
It's not the same.

692
01:28:57,660 --> 01:28:59,660
Face is passing, I'm homebound.

693
01:29:01,660 --> 01:29:03,660
There's three endings.

694
01:29:03,660 --> 01:29:06,660
Well, I already know there's a demon ending that I didn't get.

695
01:29:06,660 --> 01:29:07,660
I wanted to become a demon.

696
01:29:07,660 --> 01:29:08,660
I killed those people.

697
01:29:08,660 --> 01:29:10,660
It didn't work out for me, though.

698
01:29:12,660 --> 01:29:16,660
Oh, this is like the kindergarten thing, right?

699
01:29:16,660 --> 01:29:17,660
I can't recall.

700
01:29:18,660 --> 01:29:19,660
Hey.

701
01:29:22,660 --> 01:29:25,660
This ain't no place for a preacher.

702
01:29:25,660 --> 01:29:27,660
I have a way to relax it.

703
01:29:30,660 --> 01:29:32,660
Can I get hit by a car?

704
01:29:55,660 --> 01:29:57,660
I can get hit by a car, guys.

705
01:29:57,660 --> 01:29:59,660
I figured it out.

706
01:29:59,660 --> 01:30:01,660
Did I say Amy on the wall?

707
01:30:01,660 --> 01:30:03,660
Can I?

708
01:30:07,660 --> 01:30:12,660
Yeah, I'm not gonna break in or anything.

709
01:30:12,660 --> 01:30:14,660
Let's say Kaabunga.

710
01:30:14,660 --> 01:30:16,660
Beetlefest.

711
01:30:16,660 --> 01:30:18,660
Beelzefest.

712
01:30:18,660 --> 01:30:20,660
Is that a Beelzebub?

713
01:30:20,660 --> 01:30:22,660
Beelzebub.

714
01:30:22,660 --> 01:30:24,660
Asmodeus.

715
01:30:24,660 --> 01:30:26,660
Calling all metal fans.

716
01:30:26,660 --> 01:30:27,660
Beelzefest.

717
01:30:27,660 --> 01:30:29,660
1987 rocks the hell out of Hartford.

718
01:30:29,660 --> 01:30:31,660
Friday night, 10 p.m. to 2 a.m.

719
01:30:31,660 --> 01:30:33,660
Featuring appearances by

720
01:30:33,660 --> 01:30:34,660
When all is said and done.

721
01:30:34,660 --> 01:30:35,660
Trust no corpse.

722
01:30:35,660 --> 01:30:37,660
The horror is dead.

723
01:30:37,660 --> 01:30:38,660
Basement two.

724
01:30:38,660 --> 01:30:39,660
Return to bondage.

725
01:30:39,660 --> 01:30:40,660
Enter the sheebie.

726
01:30:40,660 --> 01:30:41,660
Among the bloodshed.

727
01:30:41,660 --> 01:30:43,660
Lying still in silence.

728
01:30:43,660 --> 01:30:44,660
Mother of shadow.

729
01:30:44,660 --> 01:30:46,660
And the door to afterbirth.

730
01:30:50,660 --> 01:30:51,660
I would sell tickets.

731
01:30:51,660 --> 01:30:52,660
$3.

732
01:30:52,660 --> 01:30:53,660
The door?

733
01:30:53,660 --> 01:30:54,660
$5.

734
01:30:54,660 --> 01:30:56,660
I can't speak fast like that.

735
01:31:00,660 --> 01:31:02,660
There's a secret boss?

736
01:31:02,660 --> 01:31:04,660
Where's the secret boss?

737
01:31:04,660 --> 01:31:06,660
I want to get the true ending.

738
01:31:06,660 --> 01:31:08,660
You feel watched.

739
01:31:10,660 --> 01:31:12,660
Am I in a hospital?

740
01:31:12,660 --> 01:31:14,660
Hi, Rhonda.

741
01:31:14,660 --> 01:31:17,660
Just a couple of reminders after last week's visit.

742
01:31:17,660 --> 01:31:19,660
Please keep your desk tidy.

743
01:31:19,660 --> 01:31:22,660
Our patients need to feel at ease with their health care

744
01:31:22,660 --> 01:31:23,660
experience.

745
01:31:23,660 --> 01:31:25,660
Remember our sales points.

746
01:31:25,660 --> 01:31:27,660
Clean, quick, courteous.

747
01:31:27,660 --> 01:31:29,660
Do not return any calls from the Department of Health

748
01:31:29,660 --> 01:31:32,660
before notifying me first or leaving a message with Tiffany.

749
01:31:32,660 --> 01:31:35,660
We cannot afford another surprise inspection.

750
01:31:35,660 --> 01:31:37,660
We cannot afford another surprise inspection.

751
01:31:37,660 --> 01:31:40,660
We cannot afford another surprise inspection.

752
01:31:40,660 --> 01:31:42,660
We cannot afford another surprise inspection.

753
01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:44,660
Please do not call me on my direct personal line

754
01:31:44,660 --> 01:31:47,660
if you happen to hear back from Mrs. Martin.

755
01:31:47,660 --> 01:31:49,660
Oh, one more thing.

756
01:31:49,660 --> 01:31:51,660
Keep Jeffrey out of sight.

757
01:31:51,660 --> 01:31:53,660
Remember, Gary loves you.

758
01:31:53,660 --> 01:31:54,660
Oh, sorry.

759
01:31:54,660 --> 01:31:56,660
I thought that was a woman.

760
01:32:00,660 --> 01:32:01,660
Haunted gurneys.

761
01:32:04,660 --> 01:32:07,660
The cop outside is just staring at us?

762
01:32:07,660 --> 01:32:09,660
I don't know if you can see us.

763
01:32:10,660 --> 01:32:12,660
This is like three-body problem.

764
01:32:12,660 --> 01:32:14,660
It's like, remember that you are loved.

765
01:32:14,660 --> 01:32:15,660
Wait, no.

766
01:32:15,660 --> 01:32:19,660
I always get three-body problem in bodies mixed up

767
01:32:19,660 --> 01:32:22,660
because there's literally like three bodies and bodies

768
01:32:22,660 --> 01:32:24,660
and you know what I meant.

769
01:32:24,660 --> 01:32:26,660
Both of those shows are great.

770
01:32:33,660 --> 01:32:37,660
I don't like that there are pictures of fetuses on the floor.

771
01:32:38,660 --> 01:32:41,660
I don't like pixel fetuses.

772
01:32:43,660 --> 01:32:45,660
I don't get to look at them.

773
01:32:47,660 --> 01:32:49,660
Erma, what the shippity?

774
01:32:49,660 --> 01:32:51,660
I don't know what's going on there.

775
01:32:51,660 --> 01:32:53,660
Hello?

776
01:32:59,660 --> 01:33:01,660
Yeah, no fucking shit.

777
01:33:01,660 --> 01:33:04,660
Part of that give me a jump scare.

778
01:33:04,660 --> 01:33:05,660
Stop!

779
01:33:05,660 --> 01:33:07,660
I'm walking past it.

780
01:33:10,660 --> 01:33:11,660
Oh, yes.

781
01:33:17,660 --> 01:33:19,660
Norman Reedus and the funky fetus.

782
01:33:19,660 --> 01:33:22,660
Sorry, I was reading chat so I walked into a wall.

783
01:33:25,660 --> 01:33:28,660
Why do I sound like I'm having a seizure?

784
01:33:31,660 --> 01:33:34,660
Let me push this chair because I'm a smart gal.

785
01:33:36,660 --> 01:33:37,660
Huh?

786
01:33:37,660 --> 01:33:39,660
No, I can't push the chair over.

787
01:33:39,660 --> 01:33:41,660
I thought this is this chair,

788
01:33:41,660 --> 01:33:44,660
so obviously here to be pushed over to the grate.

789
01:33:49,660 --> 01:33:51,660
Well, never mind.

790
01:34:00,660 --> 01:34:01,660
Stop!

791
01:34:05,660 --> 01:34:06,660
Help.

792
01:34:07,660 --> 01:34:08,660
Help.

793
01:34:09,660 --> 01:34:10,660
Help.

794
01:34:15,660 --> 01:34:17,660
I'm gonna have a baby.

795
01:34:17,660 --> 01:34:19,660
How did they rotoscope that?

796
01:34:20,660 --> 01:34:21,660
What the f-

797
01:34:21,660 --> 01:34:23,660
How am I moving?

798
01:34:29,660 --> 01:34:31,660
I hate that.

799
01:34:31,660 --> 01:34:33,660
Hide?

800
01:34:33,660 --> 01:34:36,660
How the fuck can I hide?

801
01:34:39,660 --> 01:34:41,660
Oh, you can't see me, right?

802
01:34:45,660 --> 01:34:47,660
You can't see me, right?

803
01:34:47,660 --> 01:34:49,660
I can't see me.

804
01:35:01,660 --> 01:35:03,660
Wait, is there loss on the-

805
01:35:03,660 --> 01:35:07,660
Why is there loss on the curtain?

806
01:35:09,660 --> 01:35:11,660
Can I move out?

807
01:35:13,660 --> 01:35:15,660
You can't see me.

808
01:35:15,660 --> 01:35:17,660
You can't see me.

809
01:35:31,660 --> 01:35:34,660
Shut up about hiding.

810
01:35:42,660 --> 01:35:44,660
Can I go in here?

811
01:35:45,660 --> 01:35:49,660
You can't see me, right?

812
01:36:15,660 --> 01:36:18,660
Tell me I can't go in there.

813
01:36:18,660 --> 01:36:21,660
Tell me I can't kick the door open.

814
01:36:28,660 --> 01:36:31,660
Speed! I am speed!

815
01:36:35,660 --> 01:36:38,660
I'm strapped to a gurney.

816
01:36:39,660 --> 01:36:41,660
I'd hope so.

817
01:36:41,660 --> 01:36:43,660
Thanks.

818
01:36:43,660 --> 01:36:45,660
I'm stuck.

819
01:36:47,660 --> 01:36:49,660
Are you gonna shoot me? What the hell is that?

820
01:36:49,660 --> 01:36:51,660
Let's go in here. Come on.

821
01:36:51,660 --> 01:36:53,660
Come on, copper.

822
01:36:53,660 --> 01:36:55,660
Never mind.

823
01:36:56,660 --> 01:36:58,660
Let's go upstairs, baby girl.

824
01:37:06,660 --> 01:37:09,660
We're leaving! Wait, where do I go?

825
01:37:10,660 --> 01:37:11,660
Stop!

826
01:37:11,660 --> 01:37:13,660
Wait, what? Hold on.

827
01:37:14,660 --> 01:37:16,660
Wait, actually, the one time.

828
01:37:16,660 --> 01:37:19,660
Okay, weird, but I thought I saw something in the picture.

829
01:37:19,660 --> 01:37:21,660
Like, something gold.

830
01:37:21,660 --> 01:37:23,660
I might have been to spin my cross.

831
01:37:24,660 --> 01:37:27,660
Hey, can you move the chair?

832
01:37:27,660 --> 01:37:30,660
Can you give me a boost, brother?

833
01:37:32,660 --> 01:37:34,660
I like how he says you're coming with me.

834
01:37:34,660 --> 01:37:37,660
Come on, dude. Come on.

835
01:37:37,660 --> 01:37:40,660
There you go. There you go, sugar tits.

836
01:37:40,660 --> 01:37:42,660
Give me a boost.

837
01:37:42,660 --> 01:37:44,660
Give me a fucking boost. Give me a fucking boost.

838
01:37:44,660 --> 01:37:46,660
No? Alright.

839
01:37:46,660 --> 01:37:48,660
Fuck your mother, then. I'm leaving you in this room.

840
01:37:48,660 --> 01:37:50,660
You know what? No, I'm trapping you here.

841
01:37:50,660 --> 01:37:52,660
I'm trapping you here.

842
01:37:52,660 --> 01:37:54,660
Come over here. Come over here. Come over here.

843
01:37:54,660 --> 01:37:56,660
Come over here.

844
01:37:56,660 --> 01:37:58,660
Get over here. Yep, yep, yep.

845
01:37:58,660 --> 01:38:00,660
Perfect. Nope. Perfect.

846
01:38:00,660 --> 01:38:02,660
You're trapped now.

847
01:38:10,660 --> 01:38:12,660
Damn it.

848
01:38:14,660 --> 01:38:16,660
Can we leave?

849
01:38:28,660 --> 01:38:30,660
How the fuck did you get in here, then?

850
01:38:32,660 --> 01:38:34,660
At least you have a gun.

851
01:38:34,660 --> 01:38:36,660
Huh.

852
01:38:38,660 --> 01:38:40,660
Uh, I don't know.

853
01:38:46,660 --> 01:38:48,660
Get cut!

854
01:38:48,660 --> 01:38:50,660
Oh my god.

855
01:38:52,660 --> 01:38:54,660
Don't fucking shoot me, dumbass!

856
01:38:54,660 --> 01:38:56,660
I'm backing myself into a corner.

857
01:38:56,660 --> 01:38:58,660
Hmm.

858
01:38:58,660 --> 01:39:00,660
I'm going to need your crowbar.

859
01:39:16,660 --> 01:39:18,660
Whoa, two choices here.

860
01:39:18,660 --> 01:39:20,660
One is to see you.

861
01:39:20,660 --> 01:39:22,660
One is to play 1k.

862
01:39:22,660 --> 01:39:24,660
One is to see you.

863
01:39:24,660 --> 01:39:26,660
One is to clean up this room...

864
01:39:26,660 --> 01:39:40,100
Oh wait no he shows up over here again.

865
01:39:40,100 --> 01:39:54,300
Oh never mind, no he doesn't.

866
01:39:54,300 --> 01:40:05,900
Come on, yeah get him.

867
01:40:05,900 --> 01:40:10,460
Ah I can do it through the wall.

868
01:40:10,460 --> 01:40:17,620
He did.

869
01:40:17,620 --> 01:40:25,540
Life left, I know, left me crosses on the stairs, type of things that let me know she

870
01:40:25,540 --> 01:40:26,540
hates me.

871
01:40:26,540 --> 01:40:38,020
Say it ain't so, I am a priest, oh my god I almost got hit by a car with Gary in it.

872
01:40:38,020 --> 01:40:42,460
Now go back into the clinic.

873
01:40:42,460 --> 01:40:48,700
Interesante, it's a good boss time, it's a good boss.

874
01:40:48,700 --> 01:40:54,220
Do you guys like my song?

875
01:40:54,220 --> 01:41:01,580
All the demons.

876
01:41:01,580 --> 01:41:06,860
What the fuck is this, football, the narrow.

877
01:41:06,860 --> 01:41:09,140
Go back to the gurney and get on it.

878
01:41:09,140 --> 01:41:15,140
Why would I get on the gurney, baby.

879
01:41:15,140 --> 01:41:27,820
Alright, let's catch a ride.

880
01:41:27,820 --> 01:41:34,220
What, get back to the table and back on the door?

881
01:41:34,220 --> 01:41:39,500
Get in the gurney, okay so I guess I literally have to get on that gurney.

882
01:41:39,500 --> 01:41:51,660
Oh my god, it's choked on my spit, oh yes.

883
01:41:51,660 --> 01:41:57,820
Join us, I'm trying my best here.

884
01:41:57,820 --> 01:42:22,620
No, now what do I do, I'm just doing a little jig on here, I gotta wait a bit, hello.

885
01:42:22,620 --> 01:42:32,780
Let me in, let me in.

886
01:42:32,780 --> 01:42:38,260
What the hell, zoom.

887
01:42:38,260 --> 01:42:41,980
Why do I strap myself back to it?

888
01:42:41,980 --> 01:42:50,180
Oh, I think I see what the problem is doctor, that man does not have a face.

889
01:42:50,180 --> 01:43:01,020
Oh, he about to hit the gritty.

890
01:43:01,020 --> 01:43:02,020
Alright.

891
01:43:02,020 --> 01:43:19,780
Oh, it just fucking falls out of there, what is that noise?

892
01:43:19,780 --> 01:43:31,860

01:43:32,700 --> 01:43:39,700

01:43:49,300 --> 01:44:00,740
Oh, fuck, oh, yeah?

896
01:44:00,740 --> 01:44:18,500
Little human being, John's so real for that, I'm leaving now.

01:44:18,500 --> 01:44:29,060

921
01:54:05,460 --> 01:54:20,580

923
01:54:48,580 --> 01:54:49,580
Yippee.

924
01:54:49,580 --> 01:55:03,300
Corsa, no right, that sounds so familiar.

925
01:55:03,300 --> 01:55:06,700
Catholic Flamin' 1920's number of babies.

926
01:55:06,700 --> 01:55:07,700
Yay!

927
01:55:07,700 --> 01:55:12,620
I'm happy I didn't take a bazillion years like I did with the other one.

928
01:55:12,620 --> 01:55:13,620
Got the note?

929
01:55:13,620 --> 01:55:17,420
Was there a note that I missed it?

930
01:55:17,420 --> 01:55:21,140
I was looking at chat.

931
01:55:21,140 --> 01:55:24,980
Yeah!

932
01:55:24,980 --> 01:55:27,020
Smooth moves, priest.

933
01:55:27,020 --> 01:55:28,820
But the twins are not here.

934
01:55:28,820 --> 01:55:32,100
Carry out the works of your god, wallages yet there for the night, comment.

935
01:55:32,100 --> 01:55:37,980
I can't, I don't have a voice in particular for any of them.

936
01:55:37,980 --> 01:55:47,300
He just dances up the stairs.

937
01:55:48,300 --> 01:55:57,620
Oh, I didn't mean to do that.

938
01:55:57,620 --> 01:56:01,300
I don't think Gary loves me guys, I think you're lying.

939
01:56:01,300 --> 01:56:06,900
I can't leave.

940
01:56:06,900 --> 01:56:09,860
I wonder what the red dude was then.

941
01:56:09,860 --> 01:56:15,540
There's a bunch of fetus babies around, they're suing his hips.

942
01:56:16,540 --> 01:56:17,540
He got a badonkadonk.

943
01:56:17,540 --> 01:56:22,900
We all know that he has that schlong, you can see the little thing between his legs.

944
01:56:22,900 --> 01:56:28,860
He's swinging, he big dick swinging.

945
01:56:28,860 --> 01:56:31,860
Oh!

946
01:56:31,860 --> 01:56:35,100
Do I leave?

947
01:56:35,100 --> 01:56:40,860
No, I'm not leaving yet.

948
01:56:40,860 --> 01:56:47,860
Cop is also dead, wait, what?

949
01:56:47,860 --> 01:56:52,060
Damn, how far can I go?

950
01:56:52,060 --> 01:56:56,660
Go investigate the police officer, I will do that in a moment.

951
01:56:56,660 --> 01:57:10,660
Okay, that's just going to repeat, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T,

952
01:57:10,860 --> 01:57:27,400
T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T,

953
01:57:27,400 --> 01:57:36,340
T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T.

954
01:57:36,340 --> 01:57:37,180
Hey.

955
01:57:39,100 --> 01:57:41,740
I just hold that up.

956
01:57:41,740 --> 01:57:44,180
You tell me I can't take this man's gun.

957
01:57:44,180 --> 01:57:46,060
Oh, I just walked over a crime scene.

958
01:57:47,820 --> 01:57:49,340
There's a sale going on.

959
01:57:49,340 --> 01:57:50,340
There's Gary.

960
01:57:51,540 --> 01:57:53,440
Trying to hit me with his damn car again.

961
01:57:58,660 --> 01:58:00,680
A gun with one bullet.

962
01:58:02,100 --> 01:58:03,200
There was a bird.

963
01:58:04,220 --> 01:58:05,060
I'm gonna wait.

964
01:58:07,020 --> 01:58:08,660
There's that little mouse doing mouse things.

965
01:58:08,660 --> 01:58:09,940
You can see this little tail.

966
01:58:11,780 --> 01:58:13,700
Like I was just the pixel moving.

967
01:58:16,460 --> 01:58:17,860
Can I, okay.

968
01:58:17,860 --> 01:58:19,420
I was like, hello?

969
01:58:19,420 --> 01:58:21,020
Be alza, baby.

970
01:58:25,260 --> 01:58:27,420
Sorry, that was, I got an achievement.

971
01:58:31,100 --> 01:58:31,940
Oh.

972
01:58:32,660 --> 01:58:37,660
I'm breaking the seal on your womb.

973
01:58:46,540 --> 01:58:47,380
Am I supposed to?

974
01:58:50,660 --> 01:58:51,660
Well, I'm, I'm.

975
01:58:57,020 --> 01:58:59,740
Sorry, the book just appeared.

976
01:59:00,460 --> 01:59:01,900
She looks like a guy.

977
01:59:01,900 --> 01:59:03,580
She looks hateful.

978
01:59:03,580 --> 01:59:04,620
Old you really.

979
01:59:10,460 --> 01:59:11,940
Sorry after the book is flying out of my hands.

980
01:59:12,940 --> 01:59:13,660
Old you really.

981
01:59:13,660 --> 01:59:16,220
She looked really ugly.

982
01:59:22,780 --> 01:59:24,100
She looked with her leg between the tables.

983
01:59:27,100 --> 01:59:29,140
You know, she was singing.

984
01:59:29,140 --> 01:59:31,140
I don't know why the demon take land so much

985
01:59:31,940 --> 01:59:36,620
Enominé Jesucristi ki venturas adjudicaer vivos et mortuas

Am I supposed to lead them away? Oh, I am

990
02:00:11,740 --> 02:00:17,460
Do you guys not know how to go around your own house apparently I don't like how you guys are walking

991
02:00:17,460 --> 02:00:22,500
I don't like how your feet are different than mine. What's up with that? Why do you guys have feet and I don't?

992
02:00:25,180 --> 02:00:27,180
Stay the fuck upstairs

993
02:00:28,180 --> 02:00:31,700

995
02:00:45,340 --> 02:00:47,340
Father already fucking dead

996
02:00:49,780 --> 02:00:51,780
Cuz

997
02:00:57,180 --> 02:00:59,180
I

998
02:01:06,740 --> 02:01:11,260
Damn my whoa, sorry, I'm going Super Saiyan priest

999
02:01:17,260 --> 02:01:19,260
Oh not that music

1000
02:01:19,260 --> 02:01:21,260
I

1001
02:01:25,060 --> 02:01:30,260
Waking up from a lot of dreams two days is for the profane Sabbath

1002
02:01:45,900 --> 02:01:47,980
There's so many notes at my door

1003
02:01:49,660 --> 02:01:57,060
Actually, you know what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna end it here. I've seen toys today. I'm gonna go

1004
02:02:06,780 --> 02:02:09,900
Do my mods just not exist anymore, but they just not here

1005
02:02:10,340 --> 02:02:19,580
All right, I'm just gonna whatever um

1006
02:02:23,660 --> 02:02:26,020
But uh, yeah, I'll see you guys later

1007
02:02:28,020 --> 02:02:30,420
Let me find someone to read

1008
02:02:40,780 --> 02:02:49,140
I'll miss you all I'll see you guys tomorrow for the collab. It's gonna be super fun and giggly

1009
02:02:50,820 --> 02:02:58,420
Beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep. Actually, I want to check Merrow super quick. See if you guys said anything before I get off

1010
02:02:58,420 --> 02:03:09,060
Nope. Okay, cool. Just want to make sure. And then I think I had some donos from the

1011
02:03:09,060 --> 02:03:26,500
ASMR stream that I missed. Oh, thank you anonymous for the $48 tip. That was crazy. Thank you, Jesus.

1012
02:03:27,460 --> 02:03:28,420
His name isn't Jesus.

1013
02:03:32,180 --> 02:03:35,060
All right, that was... Yeah, I missed like one random tip.

1014
02:03:39,060 --> 02:03:41,700
You're drawing my ASMR stream. Very kind. Thank you.

1015
02:03:48,020 --> 02:03:50,100
People are so sweet. I don't deserve it.

1016
02:03:50,660 --> 02:03:58,740
But maybe they're paying for the bill that I ran out on in the ASMR roleplay.

1017
02:04:00,020 --> 02:04:02,820
They're like, here's... They're like, I'll just leave the money here.

1018
02:04:04,900 --> 02:04:09,780
I thought that was pretty funny. I was like, how could I end the stream? And I'm like,

1019
02:04:10,740 --> 02:04:17,380
I mean, I've been listening to Turkey Tom's video and Daniel Larson.

1020
02:04:19,700 --> 02:04:22,500
And this is a man who's deeply disturbed, mentally ill.

1021
02:04:25,540 --> 02:04:30,420
Man, and he just constantly dines and dashes. So I'm like, yeah, let's do that.

1022
02:04:30,420 --> 02:04:39,940
There's three hour commentary on it. I've just been like, what?

1023
02:04:41,540 --> 02:04:45,300
But it's interesting because I used to work with people like that. And I'm just like,

1024
02:04:45,300 --> 02:04:48,420
this is someone who doesn't get the help that they need. It's very sad.

1025
02:04:54,500 --> 02:04:58,260
But I hope you guys like the ASMR today. I hope you guys liked the

1026
02:04:59,220 --> 02:05:07,620
faith. We're probably going to finish faith next time I play this. And then, yeah, I'm going to go

1027
02:05:07,620 --> 02:05:12,900
write a script and then try to record it. Or I'm just going to try to write a lot of scripts

1028
02:05:14,020 --> 02:05:23,540
and then try to record them. But yeah, say bye, Fiya. Bye. Oh, she's giving you guys kisses. You can't see.

1029
02:05:24,500 --> 02:05:34,180
Yeah. She's sending licks your way. Part three is pretty long. It might be a two-parter.

1030
02:05:36,980 --> 02:05:44,180
But yeah, you might get some ASMR guerrilla rambles from time to time now that I feel a lot more

1031
02:05:44,180 --> 02:05:57,460
confident with my, what's it called? Microphone settings. But yeah, I miss you guys. I'm going to

1032
02:05:57,460 --> 02:06:01,620
miss you guys. I feel like I'm leaving. Like I'm gone for two days, but it's literally going to be

1033
02:06:01,620 --> 02:06:10,580
like a couple hours. I'll see you guys tomorrow in a couple hours. But it's not now. I'm so used to

1034
02:06:10,580 --> 02:06:19,940
being hyperparas to the outside and just spam talking all the time. But I keep getting myself

1035
02:06:19,940 --> 02:06:25,620
in trouble and cause a mess when I'm going to chill out. But know that I love you when I miss you.

1036
02:06:28,420 --> 02:06:38,420
A couple hours is too long. Maybe I'll do a space note. I have to focus. I have to focus.

1037
02:06:38,420 --> 02:06:43,540
I have to lock in. I have to lock in and I have to focus.

1038
02:06:47,460 --> 02:06:56,260
Emmy just sent me part one. Oh boy. I have to listen to that. I almost started playing it on

1039
02:06:56,260 --> 02:07:06,340
stream. Let me not do that. You guys are going to like it. Have fun. Yeah. Yeah.

1040
02:07:09,540 --> 02:07:18,500
Okay. I hope you have a good night. I love you mom. I love you mom. Bye. Wait, I didn't find

1041
02:07:18,500 --> 02:07:27,300
someone to read. Hold on. Wait. We're not leaving it. Oh, that's you. That's you. That's you.

1042
02:07:33,780 --> 02:07:37,540
Okay. We got a lot. We got a couple go at least that I could rate.

1043
02:07:41,220 --> 02:07:43,940
I want to rate someone I haven't rated before.

1044
02:07:49,380 --> 02:07:53,700
Oh no. But I'm too nervous to rate that person.

1045
02:07:57,540 --> 02:08:00,180
Find someone to rate who's going to keep streaming.

1046
02:08:02,500 --> 02:08:06,180
I want to rate Kai. They just started.

1047
02:08:08,420 --> 02:08:11,780
They're playing Genshin. But I'm nervous.

1048
02:08:12,740 --> 02:08:20,740
I like Kai. Kai is cool. Do you see what happened yesterday? What happened yesterday?

1049
02:08:22,820 --> 02:08:29,300
What do you mean? Did something happen after I rated yesterday? I rated. I said hi.

1050
02:08:30,180 --> 02:08:37,220
And then I ran away because I got too embarrassed and scared to talk. And then they were doing a

1051
02:08:37,220 --> 02:08:41,300
clap. So I can do it. She ended.

1052
02:08:46,820 --> 02:08:47,700
Oh, thank you.

1053
02:08:50,420 --> 02:08:56,180
Thank you for the tap and on. Thank you for the 22, 22.

1054
02:08:57,220 --> 02:09:06,180
Is that Jesus again? It's Hessus. Jesus Christ. It keeps happening. I just have bad luck with

1055
02:09:06,180 --> 02:09:09,620
raids. Watch her just like her stream crash. Just because of me.

1056
02:09:10,740 --> 02:09:20,900
Okay. We're going to rate Kai and I'm scared. And you can just say she be raid. That's okay.

1057
02:09:23,860 --> 02:09:24,340
All right.

1058
02:09:27,860 --> 02:09:29,140
I'm going to go have a panic attack.

1059
02:09:29,860 --> 02:09:32,180
I accidentally closed the tab.

1060
02:09:40,020 --> 02:09:45,380
Please don't stop streaming raid. I got so anxious. I closed the tab.

1061
02:09:45,380 --> 02:09:53,860
Okay.

1062
02:09:58,580 --> 02:10:04,980
All right. We're doing it. We're going to raid. And it's going to be not fine.

1063
02:10:08,260 --> 02:10:14,900
Anxiety. No, don't say anxiety raid. Please don't do that. Okay. I care about you guys a lot.

1064
02:10:15,380 --> 02:10:17,380
I love you. Goodbye.
