00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,720
YouTube hates me.

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,720

We met back in Hollywood as a trinket is a amazing actress.

34
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,720
It was it was an amazing time back then you know.

35
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,720
Early.

36
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,720
Thank you.

37
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,720
I miss you so much.

38
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,720
It's literally been years since I've seen you last.

39
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,720
I know.

40
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,720
I heard that you had gotten an office job girlfriend.

41
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,720
And I blew it off like they weren't paying me enough at this office job.

42
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,720
So I took this gig being a being a madam.

43
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,720
I mean a hotel manager.

44
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:11,720
And yeah I just like to broadcast my what I'm what I'm up to.

45
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,720
Lucky.

46
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,720
I'm still in that I'm still in that really weird phase where I'm looking for that perfect

47
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,720
role.

48
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,720
Are we all are we all still searching for that one perfect role.

49
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,720
Absolutely.

50
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,720
But trinkets information is in my description.

51
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,720
If you want to go check her out please do.

52
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,720
If you don't I will fight.

53
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,720
Thank you all.

54
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,720
I'm currently trying to add my background music.

55
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,720
I feel like I should drink for this.

56
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,720
I picked up vodka soda and a sangria.

57
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,720
Oh OK.

58
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,720
I didn't know.

59
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,720
I didn't know if you'd want it that.

60
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,720
So I haven't opened either one yet.

61
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,720
Okay.

62
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,720
Damn.

63
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,720
I might have to find something to drink.

64
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:09,720
I saw like a bottle of Tito's next to me but I don't want to freaking die.

65
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,720
Tito's is like that's.

66
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,720
Oh I know what that is at vodka.

67
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,720
Yeah Tito's vodka.

68
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,720
Yeah.

69
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,720
I do like mixing that with stuff.

70
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,720
Yes.

71
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,720
It's a good.

72
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,720
I don't have anything to mix it with.

73
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,720
I would have to just drink it straight.

74
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,720
Oh no.

75
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,720
That's like drinking tequila straight.

76
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,720
Yeah.

77
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,720
It was I did that the other day as you know doing bunny garden and I almost died.

78
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,720
Of course.

79
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,720
Of course.

80
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,720
Let me I'm going to put a little thing.

81
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:44,720
I'm going to get a read like donuts and stuff and super chats at the end just so we can

82
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,720
be a little focused and not ruin the flow of such things.

83
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,720
Okay.

84
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,720
Of course.

85
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,720
I'm going to crack this bad boy open.

86
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,720
Ooh.

87
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:06,720
I would have I would have put it closer but I figure I'll leave I'll leave that to you.

88
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,720
The asthma to me.

89
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:13,720
I'm accidentally poor Bulbasaur around.

90
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,720
I was like so before this out like Tom and I was like cleaning my house and I was so

91
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,720
into like the music I was listening to and then I really had to pee and then it turned

92
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,720
into something else and so that's why I'm a little late.

93
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,720
Yeah.

94
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,720
She was telling me about that.

95
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,720
What song are you listening to that really got you grooving probably.

96
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,720
Probably.

97
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:43,720
I was feeling a little funky by the end because I was listening to the weekend out of time

98
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,720
but the Katronata remix and it's like very like 70s funky.

99
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,720
So pretty pretty good.

100
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,720
I like that a lot.

101
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,720
Actually I've been listening to a lot of Chaperon.

102
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,720
Oh, I need to start listening to her.

103
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,720
I heard she's been popping off.

104
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,720
I like her tone her sound.

105
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,720
It sounds very retro but new.

106
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:14,720
Yeah, I feel I kind of like the old retro-y sounds like I feel like the 70s 70 core pop

107
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,720
music is really catchy and I'm just like I just want to slowly groove and shake my butt

108
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:26,720
and I'm just like I know I want to insert it into my veins and just see the colors of

109
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,720
like it's vaporwave everywhere.

110
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,720
Like a drug.

111
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,720
That would actually be you know pretty funky.

112
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,720
I feel like that's just like mushrooms or LSD.

113
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,720
Man, if only, if only.

114
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,720
Oh, I may look a little bit different to some of you.

115
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,720
YouTube has come for my throat.

116
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,720
So I have to wear this cover up and I think it's pretty good.

117
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,720
It's literally just a standard YouTube studio asset.

118
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,720
It's a Lucy.

119
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,720
Yeah.

120
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,720
And Astrodia was just like they're really, they're really shitting on you right now.

121
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,720
And I'm like, okay, I'll cover myself up.

122
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,720
So that's why you'll see like alternative thumbnails that I've been editing.

123
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,720
And that I'm hiding my boob crack.

124
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,720
So, but yeah.

125
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,720
You know what you could get eventually, right?

126
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,720
What?

127
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,720
You could just get a button up shirt and just have it pop a button.

128
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,720
I'm kind of hoping for that.

129
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:43,720
I know my manager team is talking to our rigor and artists and asked if they could like to

130
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,720
button my shirt, but they have to do a whole new layer because the shirt is like not separated

131
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,720
to the jacket.

132
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:56,720
So it's like, we'll probably have to redo my whole top half.

133
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,720
Like I have a base though.

134
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,720
So it's like, it shouldn't be too hard, but it's extra work.

135
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:07,720
I also want to be able to toggle off and on my ropes because I look like a dominatrix 24 seven,

136
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,720
which is like, you know, I do have my off days.

137
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,720
I'm not, I'm not, I got to work.

138
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,720
Not always pleasure, but you know, it's fun to mix both.

139
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,720
Thank you for the rage, Johnny.

140
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,720
Hello.

141
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,720
Hello, I was just talking about you.

142
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,720
Do you like my cover up?

143
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,720
Hello, Mrs. Shibby's mom.

144
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,720
Hi.

145
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:33,720
I feel this feels like I'm having a friend over for like a play date.

146
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,720
And then Johnny's like check poking her head into the room like, how are you guys doing?

147
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,720
And we're just like making our dolls like make out or something.

148
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,720
Can I get Johnny snacks?

149
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,720
We are the snacks.

150
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,720
We are the snack.

151
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,720
You look, you look so fine today.

152
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,720
Can we just talk about this?

153
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,720
My uncle Minky really cooked an outfit.

154
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,720
Yeah.

155
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,720
Like this, uh, I can't stop staring at the tummy.

156
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,720
It's sex.

157
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:06,720
Oh, it reminds me of a certain someone.

158
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,720
I just can't put my finger on it.

159
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,720
But you know, it's an homage to like an old friend of mine.

160
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,720
Yeah.

161
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,720
I think it's really gorgeous.

162
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,720
Very like slave Leia-esque.

163
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,720
May she rest in piss wherever she is.

164
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,720
I know.

165
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,720
She'd definitely be rested in piss.

166
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,720
I, I, I, I 100% believe that.

167
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,720
Um, Shibby with an naval piercing.

168
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,720
When that actually be kind of cute.

169
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,720
I do like yours.

170
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,720
Trinket yours.

171
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,720
You're just pretty nice.

172
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,720
Thank you.

173
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,720
Usually it's a bone, but like, you know, diamonds are girls friends.

174
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,720
That's right.

175
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,720
That's true.

176
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:47,720
Oh, so well with your hair, like all the, all the, all the trinkets in your hair.

177
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,720
That's cause I'm a star, baby.

178
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,720
She's a star.

179
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,720
See her name up at lights.

180
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,720
Um, can you tell us about some of the work that you've done as a star trinket?

181
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,720
Oh man.

182
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,720
I have taken a group on walkies.

183
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,720
Oh.

184
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:14,720
And I have done monologue readings for multiple productions.

185
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,720
I haven't landed a lead yet, but I'm hoping, I'm hoping fingers crossed.

186
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,720
You know, I bet you'll get a lead soon.

187
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,720
100%.

188
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,720
Oh, absolutely.

189
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,720
And I don't mean the leash that I usually carry, but you know.

190
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,720
Oh, I have a hold on.

191
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,720
I think I, I think I have a leash on me.

192
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,720
Oh, no, that's not the leash.

193
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,720
That's all right.

194
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,720
There it is.

195
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,720
I got it.

196
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,720
There it is.

197
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,720
So, oh, maybe I should take my, like, you have to teach me about like walkies and stuff.

198
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,720
I haven't taken them for walkies.

199
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,720
I usually just sit in their cage, um, my harem.

200
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,720
So you got, you got it.

201
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,720
You got to let them stretch their legs sometimes.

202
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,720
That's a good point.

203
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,720
Oh, I've been a bad madam.

204
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,720
I'll have to take them for walkies.

205
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,720
Maybe next time.

206
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,720
Oh, they'll love it.

207
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:03,720
Or maybe we can take them together at the, towards the end of this.

208
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,720
Cause it looks like they're into either walkies or steppies.

209
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,720
Yeah.

210
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,720
Like maybe we can walkies and steppies.

211
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:17,720
I can, you know, we'll split them into two groups and divide and conquer.

212
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,720
Four feet for the price of two.

213
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,720
That's, hey, that's pretty good.

214
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,720
That's a deal.

215
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,720
You haven't been neglected.

216
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,720
You haven't been neglected shop.

217
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,720
I feed you.

218
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,720
You have a nice crate.

219
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,720
I leave the lights on for you when I leave my house.

220
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,720
You're fine.

221
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,720
That's so kind of you, especially in this economy.

222
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,720
Yeah.

223
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,720
That light bill.

224
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,720
Yeah, exactly.

225
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,720
And I have air conditioning.

226
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,720
So you're not dying, you know, it's hot.

227
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,720
It was like 95 today in my area.

228
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,720
Oh, that's not so bad.

229
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,720
You guys are probably in a brisk 75 degree house.

230
00:10:53,720 --> 00:11:00,720
Actually, according to my thermostat, it is a 70 a nice cool 70.

231
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,720
And then I, and then they can hang with my cat sometimes.

232
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,720
So.

233
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,720
Me and my fans air conditioning doesn't get down that low.

234
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,720
I, I can't even change it.

235
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:17,720
Like it like, uh, I don't know if it's like my landlords like determine for the entire

236
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,720
thing, but it's like locked and I, I can't change it.

237
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:26,720
I can only make it go cold or hot or turn it off.

238
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,720
It's 72 cold.

239
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,720
Oh, why is she be censored?

240
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,720
Oh, the other is trinket.

241
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,720
Get it right.

242
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,720
That's because I don't have the same assets as madam shabby.

243
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,720
Yeah.

244
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,720
Smaller.

245
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,720
Yeah.

246
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:50,720
Um, just like I see an Emmy, uh, the AI for YouTube does not pick up, uh, whoa chests.

247
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,720
So trinkets fine.

248
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,720
Trinket's like full Tom, she's good.

249
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,720
Yeah.

250
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,720
Tommy is totally allowed.

251
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,720
Yeah.

252
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,720
And then like, hold on.

253
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,720
Let me show off.

254
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,720
Like I kind of have you a little bit down, but like, look at her.

255
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,720
She's like, look how cute she is.

256
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,720
The little tail.

257
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,720
Wait, say something so you light up.

258
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,720
I am trinket.

259
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,720
Hi.

260
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,720
Hi.

261
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:21,720
You know, I, for the first time you showed me this, I glanced for a second because

262
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,720
I thought you had a, a razor on the headdress.

263
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,720
And I was like, that's hardcore.

264
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,720
Man, I wish.

265
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,720
Wish a, wish a bitch would.

266
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,720
She will cut a bitch.

267
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,720
Do not fuck with her, everybody.

268
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,720
She will cut you.

269
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,720
I will cry.

270
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,720
One of us will.

271
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,720
I will.

272
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,720
Yeah.

273
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,720
I'll watch.

274
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,720
I'll watch you guys.

275
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,720
Am I cut?

276
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,720
Wait, hold on.

277
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,720
If she, you're doing the cutting on the bitches and I'm watching, does that make me a cook?

278
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,720
Am I sitting in the.

279
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,720
No, no, you would never sit in the cut chair.

280
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,720
You would be front and center.

281
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,720
Okay.

282
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,720
Yes.

283
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,720
I'll be, I'll be like directing.

284
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,720
I'll feel, I feel better about that.

285
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,720
Yeah.

286
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,720
Everybody's got to have a manager.

287
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,720
Exactly.

288
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,720
I take direction.

289
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,720
Well, do you now?

290
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,720
Of course.

291
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,720
I will, I won't, I'm not going to test that.

292
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:31,720
I'm just going to believe you just so we can keep this YouTube TOS friendly.

293
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,720
Oh, okay.

294
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,720
So do you want to, do you want to get into this?

295
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,720
Of course.

296
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,720
Let's start with this plant.

297
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,720
Okay.

298
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,720
This plant.

299
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:47,720
I, if I recall, I think the person you hung out with before that you kind of modeled your

300
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,720
character wherever she is.

301
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:58,720
Didn't you guys do like, like baby or like eat or Rob as well as smash or pass?

302
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,720
Was that, was that a thing?

303
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,720
Yeah.

304
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,720
Yeah.

305
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,720
We did, we did include others because some of them you can't smash because like clearly

306
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,720
they're babies.

307
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,720
Yeah.

308
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,720
But some of them do look delectable.

309
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,720
Yeah.

310
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,720
Like you could just, you could just eat them.

311
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,720
Like this one looks like a straight up onion.

312
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,720
Yeah.

313
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,720
I would probably eat this one, but I wouldn't smash it.

314
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,720
I would, I would eat it.

315
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:24,720
100% would consume this, this little, this little cabbage onion.

316
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,720
I would let him live.

317
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,720
He can, he can, he can just go on about his way.

318
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,720
Okay.

319
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,720
All right.

320
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,720
Understandable.

321
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,720
Um, which so, are you also a pass?

322
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,720
I'm going to pass.

323
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,720
You're going to pass.

324
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,720
Okay.

325
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,720
I guess I'm just, I'm hand-able lecturing everything.

326
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,720
Although not that I'm a, all the sort, but.

327
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,720
Well, to be fair, I don't, I don't like vegetables.

328
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,720
So.

329
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,720
Oh, I'm a, I'm a huge vegetable fan.

330
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,720
So.

331
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,720
Oh, well you are, you are a rabbit, my dear.

332
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,720
That's a good point.

333
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,720
I didn't notice.

334
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,720
Um, I'm going to pass an Ivy store.

335
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,720
I feel like I would get poison Ivy if I tried to eat it.

336
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,720
So.

337
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,720
He's too cute.

338
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,720
His fangs are too cute.

339
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,720
That's a pass for me.

340
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,720
Yeah.

341
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,720
That's a pass.

342
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,720
I just got scared by my own, um, slipper.

343
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,720
I thought, oh my God, I thought something was touching my foot.

344
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,720
And I'm like, wait, this isn't one of the cats.

345
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,720
And I just freaked out a little bit.

346
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,720
Okay.

347
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,720
Anyways, moving on.

348
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,720
Um.

349
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,720
Can I say something about Venusaur?

350
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,720
Go off.

351
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,720
Say, say your truth.

352
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,720
I feel like he's the fat, ugly bastard of more like Pokemon.

353
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,720
Oh my God.

354
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,720
You're right.

355
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,720
He is.

356
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,720
Holy crap.

357
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,720
But like he would crush you if he got on top.

358
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,720
Oh yeah.

359
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,720
That would be, that would be pretty tough.

360
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,720
Getting mounted by that thing.

361
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,720
I'm good.

362
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,720
I'm good.

363
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,720
Again, I think I'd like contract some sort of allergy.

364
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,720
So.

365
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,720
Get some pollen in your eye.

366
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,720
Yeah.

367
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,720
Start sneezing.

368
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,720
I just don't even want to go through that.

369
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,720
I don't, I don't want to pollinate with this, this Venusaur.

370
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:04,720
And then there's the, the mega, which is a cuter version.

371
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,720
Yeah.

372
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,720
He's got some height to him.

373
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,720
Yeah.

374
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,720
But he's gonna be as heavy as hell.

375
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,720
Yeah.

376
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,720
I wish they like gave information about their like heights and weights.

377
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,720
That would be, that'd be pretty good.

378
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,720
This is terrifying.

379
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:25,720
The, the Gigantamax one.

380
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:33,720
I'm, I'm, you know, I'm slightly enticed by the, the little vines, but I'm going to

381
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,720
say no to words vine whip.

382
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:43,720
I'm, I'm looking at his face and he's just looking like, you know.

383
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,720
Yeah.

384
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,720
I feel like I'm going to get taken advantage of.

385
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,720
Yeah.

386
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,720
Okay.

387
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,720
I'm going to say this right now.

388
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,720
Should I put a disclaimer in my chat?

389
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,720
We are going to say some very out of pocket things.

390
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:08,720
So if you are a fan of two cute girls, uh, talking about smashing, eating, robbing

391
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:14,720
or passing on Pokemon, um, then I don't, I don't.

392
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,720
I will say something about like the, the Venusaur mega.

393
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,720
I'm going to steal that flower off his head.

394
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,720
Oh, I don't care if I have to rip it off.

395
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,720
I'm going to take that.

396
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,720
That's, yeah.

397
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,720
Yeah.

398
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,720
Yeah.

399
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,720
He's, he's got a cute flower.

400
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,720
I'm going to pick it.

401
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,720
Oh wait.

402
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,720
Are you still on the last one?

403
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,720
No, I'm not.

404
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,720
I'm on Charmander.

405
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,720
Oh, okay.

406
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,720
You're a child.

407
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,720
Okay.

408
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,720
Let me get Charmander.

409
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,720
Oh, that's a baby.

410
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,720
So that's it.

411
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,720
That's it.

412
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,720
That's it.

413
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,720
That's an eatable creature.

414
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,720
That is pure meat right there.

415
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,720
You're going to eat Charmander?

416
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,720
Yeah.

417
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,720
Yeah.

418
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,720
I bet it tastes like jerky, like spicy jerky.

419
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,720
The only problem is he'd probably be well done because he's always cooking.

420
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,720
That's a good point.

421
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,720
I like my, I like my meat kind of rare.

422
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,720
So it's a little bit pink.

423
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,720
I like it rare.

424
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,720
Yeah.

425
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,720
Yeah.

426
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,720
You know what?

427
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,720
No, I wouldn't eat him.

428
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,720
Just, just for the fact that he might be well done.

429
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,720
Yeah.

430
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,720
Okay.

431
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,400
Oh, maybe because he's younger, he wouldn't be, it's like, like a veal.

432
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,720
So make them might be a little bit more rare.

433
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,720
I don't know.

434
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,720
I don't know.

435
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,720
Like maybe if I could cut off the tail and like sample him, you think?

436
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,720
Yeah.

437
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,720
That would just kill the whole thing.

438
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,720
Yeah.

439
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,720
Hmm.

440
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,720
Yeah.

441
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,720
You might, you'd have to like eat the whole thing.

442
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,720
You can't just like, just eat the tail.

443
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,720
That's true.

444
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,720
And then like, there's the war that when his tail goes out, he dies.

445
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,720
Yeah.

446
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,720
Yeah.

447
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,720
But like, if you cut it off and it doesn't go out, he could probably stay alive.

448
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,720
Oh, that's it.

449
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,720
You know, there's a, like, has anybody experimented with that cut?

450
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,720
Just cutting off Charmander's tail.

451
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,720
So fucked.

452
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:48,720
I don't think Game Freaks made the cooking Pokemon yet.

453
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,720
Yeah.

454
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,720
I have seen like an animation of somebody like chop it up.

455
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:58,720
Oh, I got a tweet that I'm alive.

456
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,720
Thank you for the reminder.

457
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,720
Oh, I have to retweet when you tweet that you're alive.

458
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,720
I always forget to tweet that I'm alive.

459
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,720
Okay.

460
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,720
Let me just pass the hardest thing because you just want to go and hit the ground.

461
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,720
Run it.

462
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:16,720
I literally, I just, and I can't like schedule tweets either because how I am.

463
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,720
You can't put links and schedule tweets.

464
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,720
And you never know if you're going to want a gorilla.

465
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,720
Exactly.

466
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,720
Sometimes I want to stream earlier.

467
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,720
Sometimes I, you know, have to use the bathroom.

468
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:32,720
So I run a couple minutes behind, you know, if you like that sometimes.

469
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,720
Got to keep them on their toes.

470
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,720
Never let them get your next move.

471
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,720
Exactly.

472
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,720
So I'm on Charmillion.

473
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,720
I'm going to type up my tweet and you can chat about your opinion.

474
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,720
Okay.

475
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:51,720
So for me, I think I, I think this will be my first smash because he's got them big, strong

476
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,720
arms.

477
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,720
And plus like, if you were to sit on his head, you could write his head cause he's got the

478
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,720
appendage up there too.

479
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,720
You're not wrong.

480
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,720
You're not wrong.

481
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,720
Not an eye.

482
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:11,720
I'm partially swayed by that, but he kind of just looks like he wouldn't like, he just

483
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:16,720
like, not like hitting and quit it, but he'd like just, he would complete you.

484
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,720
Yeah.

485
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,720
He wouldn't call me.

486
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,720
He would complete.

487
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,720
And then like, he just roll over and be like, so did you come?

488
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,720
And I'm just like, I'm not really, he just has that expression.

489
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,720
Yeah.

490
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,720
He looks cocky.

491
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,720
Like ain't not the best thing.

492
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,720
Yeah.

493
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:38,720
But even then, like, even if he did finish, like you could get off on your own.

494
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,720
He's got extra bits that stay hard forever.

495
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,720
That's a good point.

496
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,720
That's a good point.

497
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,720
I'm wondering where he puts like, where's, where would, where it's going to come from.

498
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,720
But you know what I mean?

499
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,720
I'm going to pass and you're going to smash, right?

500
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,720
Yeah, I'm going to, I'm going to smash.

501
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,720
I feel like I should have had a counter, but it's fine.

502
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,720
I think it does it at the bottom, doesn't it?

503
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,720
I don't know.

504
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,720
It does.

505
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,720
It'll, it'll, it'll put a green box around the ones that you say smashed to.

506
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,720
Oh, okay.

507
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,720
I just haven't smashed anything yet, so that makes sense.

508
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,720
But that might change with the next one.

509
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,720
That's a good point.

510
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,720
Cause we got Charizard.

511
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,720
I am smashing the dragon.

512
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,720
Thank you.

513
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,720
I mean, I mean, he's our first short king.

514
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,720
He's a short king?

515
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,720
I thought he's a dragon.

516
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,720
I know he's a dragon, but Charizard's like canonical height is very short.

517
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,720
Is it really?

518
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,720
I didn't know that.

519
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,720
You know, I don't, I don't.

520
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,720
He's five, he's five seven.

521
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:42,720
Charizard's only five seven?

522
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,720
Yeah, he's only five seven.

523
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,720
You know, I don't mind that cause that's like, that's literally just like an inch taller than me.

524
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,720
So we could be like eye to eye.

525
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,720
That's like perfect height.

526
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,720
Absolutely.

527
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,720
Yeah.

528
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:57,720
Five seven eight that short.

529
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:03,720
People, people, you feel like it's for a dragon.

530
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,720
Calm down everybody for a dragon.

531
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,720
For a dragon.

532
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,720
It's kind of small.

533
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,720
It's kind of small for a dragon.

534
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,720
Just, yeah, just for a dragon.

535
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,720
Also, you guys could totally do it while airborne.

536
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,720
So yeah.

537
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,720
He's a total smash.

538
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,720
Yeah.

539
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,720
I'm, I'm, I'm smashing the dragon.

540
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:23,720
Um, Charizard's mega.

541
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,720
Those baby arms.

542
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,720
Those baby arms.

543
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,720
Yeah.

544
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,720
I don't like them.

545
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:33,720
I feel like I would get hurt by the little, the double wings.

546
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,720
Yeah.

547
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,720
Like, like slapping would be nice.

548
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,720
But like, I don't, I don't know.

549
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,720
It's not feeling that, you know.

550
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,720
And then like the spikes on top of his head is totally unusable now.

551
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,720
Yeah.

552
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:50,720
I can't do anything with that.

553
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,720
I think it's a, I think it's a pass.

554
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,720
Yeah.

555
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,720
For the Y.

556
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,720
However.

557
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,720
However.

558
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:02,720
I'm kind of feeling Charizard mega X.

559
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,720
I just like the color palette a lot.

560
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,720
He's also got built-in handlebars that aren't his hip.

561
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,720
That's a good point.

562
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,720
Maybe he's into pegging.

563
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,720
Maybe he, you know, be pretty cool.

564
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,720
I'm going to, I'm going to smash.

565
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,720
I'm going to smash that.

566
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,720
Same.

567
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,720
Um, no, I, no, put him, put him out, put him out.

568
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,720
I would just be on fire and he would just sit on me and kill me.

569
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,720
So.

570
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,720
Yeah.

571
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,720
He's doing, he's doing too much.

572
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,720
Yeah.

573
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,720
He just seems like he's, he's just like, yeah.

574
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,720
He's just trying too much.

575
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,720
Like he's like compensating for something, you know.

576
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,720
Although I do like his womb tattoo.

577
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,720
His.

578
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,720
Wait.

579
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,720
He has a womb tattoo.

580
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,720
Oh my gosh.

581
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,720
He does notice that.

582
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:53,720
That's pretty, that's pretty cute.

583
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,720
Um, okay.

584
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,720
This is a baby.

585
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,720
That is a baby.

586
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,720
I, I can't eat it because it's too baby.

587
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,720
Yeah.

588
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:08,720
I like, I also, Squirtle has a soft spot in my heart because they were my starter.

589
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:15,720
And I, like, when I first played fire red and I named him Squirt, not understanding

590
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,720
the connotation.

591
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,720
Um, so I'm, I have to pass.

592
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,720
I would, I would lovingly cherish Squirtle.

593
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,720
Squirt could mean a lot of things though.

594
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,720
Like he's a small fry.

595
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,720
He's a little guy.

596
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,720
He gets a squirt.

597
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,720
Exactly.

598
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,720
That's why I call him Squirt.

599
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,720
And it's like, you know, I'm a kid.

600
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:38,720
So I'm not that like smart when it comes to naming things because it's fucking in his

601
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,720
name.

602
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,720
Of course.

603
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,720
Squirt has fainted.

604
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,720
He is a friend shaped little guy.

605
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,720
I love him.

606
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:48,720
And then when he was blast toys, he was called Squirt.

607
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,720
I mean, to be fair, you're not wrong.

608
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,720
That water pressure though.

609
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,720
Uh, let's, I'm just going to pass.

610
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,720
Um, war total.

611
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,720
Oh, that's a smash for me.

612
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,720
That's a smash for you.

613
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,720
Yeah.

614
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,720
Again, I've always liked the way that war total looks, especially his fluffy tail.

615
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,720
Yeah.

616
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,720
He does have a cute tail.

617
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,720
Very cute tail.

618
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:17,720
And like his, I always liked his little like ear wing things, whatever that is.

619
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,720
Um, I wouldn't smash him though.

620
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:25,720
He just looks like, again, like a shitty, annoying teenager that like, I would probably

621
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:29,720
have to teach to do things to, so that I could complete.

622
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,720
So I don't know.

623
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,720
I think he could, I think he could figure it out.

624
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:37,720
He's got that, he's got that ginky anime protagonist.

625
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,720
Let's need some goggles on him.

626
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,720
And he's like a Digimon protagonist.

627
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,720
That's, that's a good point.

628
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,720
That's a good point.

629
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,720
Um, I am going to pass.

630
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,720
So, and then you got Blastoise.

631
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,720
I'm going to smash Blastoise.

632
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,720
Uh, this one's hard.

633
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,720
Yeah.

634
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,720
He's very handsome though.

635
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,720
Like he's a barra handsome.

636
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,720
Yeah.

637
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:08,720
And then again, like I mentioned the water pressure and I don't, I think I would like the sensation

638
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,720
of those, his like little claws gripping me, you know.

639
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,720
Also, I bet he's just really smooth.

640
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,720
I like that expression.

641
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:21,720
He's like, you know, like, he knows what he's doing.

642
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,720
He knows his way around.

643
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,720
Yeah.

644
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,720
He's a veteran.

645
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,720
Yeah.

646
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,720
Uh, and this is like his weird brother.

647
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,720
Yeah.

648
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,720
No, he's right off.

649
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,720
Oh, good.

650
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,720
And I'm not going.

651
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,720
I'm not going.

652
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,720
And that's a tank.

653
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:43,720
Um, I'm good with the gig, the Gigantamax 22.

654
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,720
Yeah.

655
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,720
That's a no for me.

656
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,720
He's only five feet tall.

657
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,720
That's fine.

658
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,720
That's okay.

659
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,720
I don't mind a short king.

660
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,720
Yeah.

661
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,720
We established that with Charizard.

662
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,720
Yeah.

663
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:59,720
I like, you know, they, they, they, they try a little bit harder because they know they're

664
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,720
not as tall.

665
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,720
It's never really mattered to me how tall you are, but like, I get it can be a soft spot

666
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,720
for some dudes, you know.

667
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,720
Yeah.

668
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,720
Especially if it's not fair and you're wearing heels all the time.

669
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,720
Yeah.

670
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:17,120
I still don't know my height without my heels because I'm 168 centimeters with heels and

671
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,720
I don't know how tall my heels are.

672
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,720
So I have to ask my mom.

673
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,720
Yeah.

674
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,720
Okay.

675
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,720
Hmm.

676
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,720
This is a caterpillar.

677
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:36,160
Well, yeah, but he's got one of those mouths that look like those sectiony toys.

678
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,720
Is that a mouth?

679
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,720
Yeah.

680
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,720
Does that open?

681
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:44,720
I mean, I just kind of assumed that it was like a hole in his face, you know.

682
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:52,720
And, you know, I feel like he could crawl up in there and just like do his thing.

683
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,720
Yeah.

684
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,720
And then he just come right back out.

685
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,720
Yeah.

686
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,720
You know what?

687
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,720
Yeah.

688
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,720
I'll do it.

689
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,720
I'm, I'm, I'll try new things.

690
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,720
Yeah.

691
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,720
I mean, bondage fairies walk so we could run.

692
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,720
Exactly.

693
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,720
All right.

694
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,720
I'm going to smash.

695
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,720
Metapod.

696
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,720
Again.

697
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,720
Harden.

698
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,720
It's a given.

699
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,720
It's a given.

700
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,720
It's a given.

701
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,720
I'm sorry.

702
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,720
I'm smashing.

703
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,720
I'm smashing metapod.

704
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,720
It's testing your limit.

705
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,720
Exactly.

706
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:28,720
And then like, look at all those ridges and edges like, come on, he's ripped for your

707
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,720
pleasure.

708
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,720
Exactly.

709
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,720
That was so good.

710
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:37,720
Oh my God.

711
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:43,720
Um, that's a bug.

712
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,720
The other ones were bugs, but this is different.

713
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,720
It's a butterfly.

714
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,720
This one's a little too delicate.

715
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,720
You get those wings wet and it's over for you.

716
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,720
Yeah.

717
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,720
Like, what if I'm feeling extra, you know, spicy that day?

718
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,720
I make a mess.

719
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,720
Like what's, what's going to happen to butterfree?

720
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,720
What's going to happen?

721
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,720
That's what's going to happen.

722
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,720
It's going to disintegrate in my shoes.

723
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,720
The pH acid.

724
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,720
Jesus fuck.

725
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:17,720
That's a horrible image.

726
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,720
Uh, I don't care, but it just has bigger wings.

727
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,720
That doesn't really make a difference to me.

728
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,720
Um, beetle.

729
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,720
Okay.

730
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,720
So this, this, this one, I'm a little torn on because I want the same.

731
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,720
Yeah.

732
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,720
But on the other, like a horn.

733
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,720
Yeah.

734
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,720
I'm like, I'm like, oh, maybe if I'm feeling a little adventurous,

735
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,720
cause like reminds me of beads.

736
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,720
Um,

737
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,720
Like you could grind on it, maybe.

738
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,720
Yeah.

739
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,720
Yeah.

740
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,720
Can use that as a grinder.

741
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,720
Like his little, his little sections part.

742
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,720
You got to be brave.

743
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,720
I don't know.

744
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,720
I don't think I'm that brave.

745
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,720
Yeah.

746
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:01,720
I just feel like my cervix would just be destroyed.

747
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,720
If I try to sit on his head.

748
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,720
Uh, and I feel like I would struggle,

749
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,720
like I would probably just crush him.

750
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,720
If I tried to grind on him.

751
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,720
So I'm going to say pass just for our,

752
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,720
both of our safety.

753
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,720
You know.

754
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,720
Yeah.

755
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,720
I'm going to pass on this one.

756
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,720
Pass on Weedle.

757
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,720
Cocuna.

758
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,720
Cocuna.

759
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,720
Same thing as Metapod though.

760
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,720
Going up my ass.

761
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,720
Expeditiously.

762
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,720
I mean, if you, if you turn them upside down,

763
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,720
he's got a flared base.

764
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,720
So I can see where you're coming from.

765
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,720
Yeah.

766
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,720
Yeah.

767
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,720
Exactly.

768
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,720
Exactly.

769
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,720
You understand me.

770
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,720
You understand me.

771
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,720
I see you and you're so valid.

772
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,720
Thank you.

773
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,720
Thank you.

774
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,720
Okay.

775
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,720
Smash B drill.

776
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,720
Okay.

777
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,720
He's already got it built in and on display.

778
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,720
I know it's like pointier,

779
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,720
but there's like something like,

780
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,720
like Weedle and stuff,

781
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,720
but like, I don't know.

782
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,720
There's just something about B drill that just like draws me to him.

783
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,720
I don't know.

784
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,720
I don't like bees.

785
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,720
That's true.

786
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:03,720
Like what it, is it going to sting me?

787
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,720
He's going to be an asshole the whole time.

788
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,720
Like you're not threatening him,

789
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,720
but he's going to be like sting, sting, sting,

790
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,720
plays it, sting, sting, sting.

791
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,720
Yeah.

792
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,720
Or just like just kind of like buzzing around,

793
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,720
like just like kind of being pastry.

794
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,720
Yeah.

795
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,720
Actually I'm going to pass.

796
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,720
I'm going to pass.

797
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,720
Me too.

798
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,720
Reminder.

799
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,720
This is Markiplier's first smash.

800
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,720
That's right.

801
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,720
He did smash B drill.

802
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,720
Well, that's because it's black and yellow,

803
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,720
and though they're two sexy color combination.

804
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,720
They are.

805
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,720
They are.

806
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,720
B drill mega would kill me.

807
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,720
Like I like a little bit of pain.

808
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,720
There's five spikes on this bucket.

809
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,720
I know.

810
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,720
And like that could like, you know,

811
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,720
impale all points of me,

812
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,720
but like usually I'm the one dishing it out.

813
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,720
So I'm going to say pass.

814
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,720
I still don't like bees.

815
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,720
Okay.

816
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,720
Pidgey, this is a bird.

817
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,720
I'm not smashing a bird.

818
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,720
I'm going to eat this.

819
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,720
You're going to eat.

820
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,720
Yeah.

821
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,720
I'll eat the bird.

822
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,720
I'll eat.

823
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,720
Yeah.

824
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,720
Cause like all these birds have cloacas.

825
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,720
Well, the cloaca doesn't turn me off.

826
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,720
Right.

827
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,720
It's the fact that it's a bird.

828
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,720
I don't really,

829
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,720
I can't recall what a cloaca looks like.

830
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,720
So can it like come out of it?

831
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,720
The bird?

832
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,720
Like, or do they,

833
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,720
don't they just like put their butts together?

834
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,720
Right.

835
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,720
I think it's like a sort of suction cup sort of thing for some,

836
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,720
except for like ducks who have the corkscrew.

837
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,720
Yeah.

838
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,720
The corkscrew pee pee and the corkscrew vagina.

839
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,720
Oh, well it's like a maze vagina.

840
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,720
Like a, yeah.

841
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,720
Cause they have like other, other.

842
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,720
Yeah.

843
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,720
I remember reading about that for some odd reason.

844
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,720
I'm not,

845
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,720
I'm going to eat the bird.

846
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,720
So pass.

847
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,720
Yeah.

848
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,720
Yeah.

849
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,720
We're going to,

850
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,720
we're going to eat that bird.

851
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,720
See this is a good meal.

852
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,720
That's a good meal right there.

853
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,720
That's a,

854
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,720
that could feed a family of three.

855
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,720
The Pidgeotto.

856
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,720
Yeah.

857
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,720
Yeah.

858
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,720
But then you were like talking about suction.

859
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:20,720
So like now I'm debating whether or not I want to fuck the birds.

860
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,720
I'm a fan of suction.

861
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,720
I'm not going to though.

862
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,720
I'm going to,

863
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,720
I'm not even going to eat that because I just feel like,

864
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,720
like preparing this,

865
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,720
like processing this bird would just like be such an annoyance.

866
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,720
Yeah.

867
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,720
I mean,

868
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,720
I didn't say I would prep it.

869
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,720
I'd probably catch it and give it to some like Pokemon chef.

870
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,720
Oh,

871
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,720
that's a good point.

872
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,720
Okay.

873
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,720
Cause I can't cook.

874
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:51,720
I have to cook you a meal sometime then drink it.

875
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:54,720
I'm going to pass on the verb.

876
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,720
Me too.

877
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,720
And then same for Pidgeot,

878
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,720
it's just longer hair.

879
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,720
I don't,

880
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,720
she's getting that anime protagonist hair.

881
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,720
Yeah.

882
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,720
And the same thing with Pidgeot mega,

883
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,720
it's even more so anime protagonist hair.

884
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,720
It's just like,

885
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:14,720
it's like an honestly gorgeous bird.

886
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,720
I would pass.

887
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,720
I would spare its life.

888
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,720
I also wouldn't eat it.

889
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,720
So,

890
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:20,720
yeah,

891
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,720
I'd want to see him flying free.

892
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,720
Why is the bird five feet?

893
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:24,720
What the heck?

894
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,720
That's so weird.

895
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:26,720
Because you can ride him,

896
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,720
but not in that way.

897
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:28,720
Oh,

898
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,720
that's a good point.

899
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,720
You know,

900
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,720
I let him take me on a date so I could just like fly around on him.

901
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,720
That'd be fun.

902
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:36,720
Um,

903
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,720
ratatata,

904
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,720
ratatata,

905
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,720
ratatata.

906
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,720
Um,

907
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,720
that's a,

908
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,720
that's a rat.

909
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,720
Um,

910
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,720
I pet him.

911
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:45,720
Yeah.

912
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,720
I'd snuggle him.

913
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,720
Um,

914
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,720
I don't think we could have coitus.

915
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:50,720
However,

916
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,720
uh,

917
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,720
I would probably kill him.

918
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,720
So I'm going to say pass.

919
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,720
Yeah,

920
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,720
he's baby.

921
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,720
Yeah,

922
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,720
that's a baby would not hurt the baby.

923
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,720
Yeah.

924
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,720
That's a baby with a mustache.

925
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,720
What's that?

926
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,720
A baby with a mustache.

927
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,720
That's a baby with a job.

928
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,720
No,

929
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,720
thank you.

930
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,720
I just,

931
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,720
I just feel like he has like a really thick,

932
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,720
like,

933
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,720
a New York accent.

934
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,720
Like,

935
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,720
ah,

936
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,720
I need to get to my appointment.

937
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,720
Okay.

938
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,720
Get out of my way.

939
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,720
I'm walking.

940
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,720
I'm walking.

941
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,720
Yeah.

942
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,720
I'm trying.

943
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,720
I'm going to be late.

944
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,720
I'm supposed to see my,

945
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,720
my grandmother after this for some spaghetti

946
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:31,720
at her family restaurant.

947
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,720
You know,

948
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,720
I've had a very masterful,

949
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,720
as a kid,

950
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,720
oh,

951
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,720
this is,

952
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:43,720
He does. He does. He does have that feel. He does. He just needs a hat.

953
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:47,720
He just needs a hat. Just like a little, like a fedora, bowler hat.

954
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,720
Um, pass.

955
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,720
My brother Tony says.

956
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:57,720
And if you don't pay up, we're gonna have problems now.

957
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:06,720
Okay, eradicate. Um, I'm kind of scared to eradicate.

958
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,720
I feel like it would bite my clothes.

959
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:13,720
I mean, I don't think I would let his face to be downstairs.

960
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:18,720
Is it the tail you maybe might use?

961
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,720
You know, I don't think I would. I don't think I'd use this rat at all.

962
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,720
I think it's just a straight up pass.

963
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:31,720
What if he's hungry and eating?

964
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:35,720
I thought they accidentally sent a smash.

965
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:39,720
You can click on it in the bottom.

966
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,720
Yeah, there you go.

967
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,720
Oh my God.

968
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:47,720
I don't know what we got so far.

969
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,720
The rats, the rats are just a.

970
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,720
Yeah, the rats. I'm good.

971
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,720
And we're back to another eating line.

972
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,720
I'm telling you.

973
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,720
Tony.

974
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,720
Yeah, I'm eating this. I'm eating this bird.

975
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,720
He looks delightfully.

976
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,720
So good.

977
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,720
Those legs, like I don't, like I've never had chicken feet before,

978
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,720
but those look like really tasty feet.

979
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,720
Oh, like you would eat those pickled.

980
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,720
Yeah, 100% are like fried up crispy.

981
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,720
Yeah, you can't lie.

982
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,720
Are you the big cheese rat?

983
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,720
Mr. Bombastic.

984
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,720
Mr. Love a lover.

985
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,720
Actually, I do. Yeah, he's pretty cool.

986
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,720
Oh, are you going to say I'm sorry?

987
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,720
I like the biggest rat.

988
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,720
Small rat hate.

989
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:39,720
Okay, I'm passing on Spiro.

990
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:42,720
Spiro looks like an asshole.

991
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,720
Again, I'm just scared of his beak.

992
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,720
I feel like I would be impaled.

993
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,720
So I'm good. I don't even want to eat it.

994
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:55,720
I just feel like it would be really not tasty meat.

995
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,720
Because it's so full of fear.

996
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,720
You know how like fear can spoil a meat.

997
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:03,720
Can fear spoil a meat or does it make it the most electable?

998
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,720
Wow.

999
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,720
Hmm. That's it. That's the question.

1000
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,720
That's the question of the century.

1001
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,720
But then again, I guess happy cows make for happier steaks.

1002
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,720
So it can drill.

1003
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,720
Okay, we also people are wanting us to take into consideration

1004
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:23,720
their their move sets because this has drill pick.

1005
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:29,720
No, I don't want to drill anywhere near my business.

1006
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,720
Okay, I'm passing.

1007
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:37,720
I don't I don't need a hole drilled up into my womb.

1008
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:41,720
Drill pack my cervix.

1009
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,720
Um, how can emotions change in me?

1010
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,720
Emotions can change in me because when you are feeling certain emotions,

1011
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,720
it releases different chemicals in your body.

1012
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,720
So that can take change the flavor of the meat.

1013
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,720
But yes, um, this is a baby.

1014
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,720
But it's a yes.

1015
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,720
We are fucking this baby.

1016
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,720
Don't please don't.

1017
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,720
Oh, God.

1018
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:14,720
Um, yes, I'm going to smash.

1019
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,720
That's because it literally is anal beads on its tail.

1020
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,720
So sign me up.

1021
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,720
See, I know.

1022
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,720
And it's little tongue is mouth is cute.

1023
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,720
Yeah, I can have always been cute.

1024
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,720
And I think Jesse and James for that.

1025
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:34,720
Underappreciated Pokemon always.

1026
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,720
Uh, Arbok smash.

1027
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,720
Oh, absolutely.

1028
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,720
Also, I bet he's a really good coupler afterwards.

1029
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:48,720
Oh, yeah, just like kind of just like, um, coil around you and you guys can just like

1030
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,720
hang out.

1031
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,720
I feel like you would give really good kisses.

1032
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,720
I don't know that tongue.

1033
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:58,720
Like I have his teeth, but like tongue, the end of that tail.

1034
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,720
Yeah.

1035
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:05,720
Also, you got to take into account that snakes have to.

1036
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,720
Oh my God.

1037
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,720
You're right.

1038
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,720
Oh, smash.

1039
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,720
Smash.

1040
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,720
Pikachu.

1041
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,720
Pika, Pika.

1042
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,720
That's an E for me.

1043
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,720
Uh, yeah, I'd eat Pikachu.

1044
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,720
I would not smash them.

1045
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,720
Uh, but I would eat them.

1046
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:29,720
Uh, I feel like they would have like either like a Zesty.

1047
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:33,720
Citrusy flavor or like it would pair well with that.

1048
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,720
Like I feel like a Pino.

1049
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,720
Um, Grigio.

1050
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,720
Something right to pair with.

1051
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,720
Yeah.

1052
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,720
Yeah.

1053
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,720
Uh, I would eat Pikachu.

1054
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,720
Mm hmm.

1055
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,720
Yeah.

1056
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,720
Not into electric stimulation.

1057
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,720
Yes.

1058
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,720
But like we'll get to that.

1059
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,720
Don't worry.

1060
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,720
I just wouldn't, I wouldn't fuck this mouse.

1061
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,720
This particular one now.

1062
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,720
Yeah.

1063
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,720
This electric mouse.

1064
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,720
I'm gonna pass, but eat.

1065
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,720
Uh, that's a fat boy.

1066
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,720
I'm good.

1067
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,720
Yeah.

1068
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,720
I'm good.

1069
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,720
But he'll crush me.

1070
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,720
The original fat boy is back.

1071
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,720
Oh.

1072
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,720
Oh, fat Pikachu.

1073
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,720
I don't, I don't mind a little bit of chub.

1074
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:15,720
I don't mind a little bit of chub or chunk, but, um, I would eat this one still.

1075
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:20,720
Uh, especially cause it's probably, it's maybe more flavor from the fat on the meat.

1076
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,720
You know what?

1077
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,720
You know what makes me laugh?

1078
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,720
Mods are asleep.

1079
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:30,720
Post path, fat Pikachu.

1080
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,720
Yeah.

1081
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,720
Tell me, are you like my only mod right now?

1082
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,720
I'm just kidding.

1083
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,720
Everybody's been pretty good.

1084
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,720
I might.

1085
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,720
Yeah.

1086
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,720
They're probably just hiding.

1087
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,720
Yeah.

1088
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,720
They're just, you know, the marbling would be insane.

1089
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:46,720
That's like a wagyu.

1090
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:50,720
Uh, he's so full of happiness and delicious.

1091
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,720
Yeah.

1092
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,720
Oh, that would be a delectable meal.

1093
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,720
Absolutely delicious.

1094
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,720
You'd cook him like you would cook Korean barbecue.

1095
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,720
Yes.

1096
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:02,720
Um, what about Raichu though?

1097
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,720
Oh, that's a smash for me.

1098
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,720
Yeah.

1099
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,720
Explain.

1100
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,720
I need, I need the details.

1101
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,720
Okay.

1102
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,720
So when I was younger, I had them.

1103
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,720
Right.

1104
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,720
Oh, okay.

1105
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:19,720
I was like, where is this going?

1106
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:22,720
I guess, I just think Raichu is like the cooler cousin.

1107
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,720
Or I guess the cool dad of Pikachu.

1108
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:26,720
Okay.

1109
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,720
He's got an extra chewy tail.

1110
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,720
If you guys like one of the original like Raichu toys.

1111
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,720
Oh, good point.

1112
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,720
I also like to chew on stuff myself.

1113
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,720
So I totally understand.

1114
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:39,720
I'm literally like eating some applesauce and showing on the cap right now.

1115
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:44,720
I wouldn't smash them though, but I wouldn't eat them.

1116
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,720
Um, I don't know.

1117
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,720
I just like to hang out.

1118
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:54,720
Like shoot the shit Raichu, I think.

1119
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:58,720
Understandable because he probably is really good at conversation.

1120
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,720
He's a war vet, don't you know?

1121
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:02,720
That's yeah.

1122
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,720
Yeah.

1123
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,720
Yeah.

1124
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,720
He's been through a lot.

1125
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,720
A lot of good stories.

1126
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,720
Um, Raichu Alola.

1127
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,720
God, I want to eat him.

1128
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:14,720
I also, yeah, I would devour this thing.

1129
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:15,720
I don't know.

1130
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:18,720
I feel like it's like caramel toffee.

1131
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,720
Like dessert.

1132
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,720
With a little bit of vanilla.

1133
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,720
Yeah.

1134
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:24,720
Some whipped cream toast.

1135
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,720
Yeah.

1136
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,720
Or like some like some sort of cream filling.

1137
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,720
And you know, I love me some cream filling.

1138
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,720
Oh, absolutely.

1139
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,720
Like a Boston cream donut.

1140
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:34,720
Oh, yep.

1141
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,720
I am devouring this one.

1142
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:38,720
Yeah.

1143
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,720
Uh, Sanchu.

1144
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,720
That's a baby.

1145
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,720
That's a baby.

1146
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:44,720
Yeah.

1147
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,720
I love all of them.

1148
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:46,720
They're just so cute.

1149
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:47,720
I love their little eyes.

1150
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:48,720
So pretty.

1151
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,720
Oh, I have always liked them.

1152
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:52,720
Yeah.

1153
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:53,720
They're cute.

1154
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:54,720
Yeah.

1155
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:55,720
We'll pass.

1156
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:56,720
It's a, it's a pass.

1157
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,720
Uh, what about the Alolan one?

1158
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:58,720
Looks like a little igloo.

1159
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,720
This is a baby in a different color.

1160
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:06,720
This is, this is, this is alternate ethnicity.

1161
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:07,720
Baby.

1162
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:08,720
Um, yeah.

1163
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:09,720
We'll pass.

1164
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:12,720
This one's from the Arctic.

1165
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,720
It's fine.

1166
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,720
I might eat this one.

1167
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:18,720
Cause I feel like it would be like a vanilla,

1168
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,720
like creamy popsicle.

1169
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,720
So I'll eat it.

1170
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,720
Or I might like bite the tail off.

1171
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,720
Or like just come the tail.

1172
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,720
Just give me a taste.

1173
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,720
Like, like Sonic ice.

1174
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,720
Like you could just pick the bricks off of him.

1175
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:33,720
Yeah.

1176
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:34,720
Exactly.

1177
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,720
I got it.

1178
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:38,720
It's going to be a pass for me.

1179
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:39,720
Yeah.

1180
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:40,720
Yeah.

1181
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:41,720
A pass.

1182
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:42,720
Sand slash.

1183
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:43,720
Yeah.

1184
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:45,720
I'm worried about them claws.

1185
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:46,720
Yeah.

1186
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,720
And everything looks sharp.

1187
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,720
A lot of edges.

1188
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,720
Uh, the horn on the head looks too sharp.

1189
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,720
I don't think you could ride that.

1190
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:56,720
No.

1191
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:57,720
Yeah.

1192
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,720
Unless he's like soft.

1193
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:00,720
Yeah.

1194
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:01,720
Yeah.

1195
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:04,720
I can't really tell if he's like, can he like harden?

1196
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,720
Can he like make himself softer?

1197
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:08,720
Cause I don't want to, and again,

1198
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:09,720
I don't want to hurt myself,

1199
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,720
but I'm going to pass cause I don't know.

1200
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:12,720
I'm going to pass too.

1201
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,720
Uh, that's a popsicle.

1202
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:15,720
Um.

1203
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,720
You'd get stuck.

1204
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:18,720
Yeah.

1205
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,720
That's an, I like, I would definitely my tongue.

1206
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,720
I can't even eat that.

1207
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,720
Or he'd get stuck.

1208
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:25,720
If you know.

1209
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:26,720
Oh.

1210
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,720
Because of the two differing temperatures.

1211
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,720
Good point.

1212
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:32,720
Ow.

1213
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:33,720
Uh, yeah.

1214
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,720
I'm going to say no.

1215
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:37,720
Like an ice cube up there.

1216
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:38,720
Oh.

1217
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,720
If it was like a little bit of play,

1218
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,720
like a little foreplay with it,

1219
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,720
I'd be fine.

1220
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:44,720
But like if it's up there,

1221
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,720
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm good.

1222
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:47,720
I'm good.

1223
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:48,720
It's the whole time.

1224
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:49,720
It'd be the full time.

1225
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,720
That's so cold.

1226
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,720
Uh, what did I melt it?

1227
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:55,720
Like I feel like my body heat would bring it down.

1228
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:58,720
Or maybe I would just get fucking hyperthermia.

1229
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,720
You probably get hyperthermia because I don't think he'd melt

1230
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:02,720
the pill he's done.

1231
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,720
You know?

1232
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:04,720
Oh gosh.

1233
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,720
Yeah.

1234
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:06,720
I'm good.

1235
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,720
I'd get wet, but not in the right ways.

1236
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:10,720
Um.

1237
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:17,720
Uh, dish it a little dish it a little baby.

1238
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:18,720
I would pass.

1239
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,720
I wouldn't even eat it.

1240
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:21,720
Nah.

1241
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:22,720
Same.

1242
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:23,720
Also it's poison.

1243
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:24,720
Yeah.

1244
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:25,720
Just a little guy.

1245
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:26,720
Just a little boy.

1246
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,720
You know what I didn't realize what this was for the longest time?

1247
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,720
I didn't realize that these were rabbits.

1248
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:33,720
What?

1249
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,720
These are rabbits?

1250
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,720
They're rabbits.

1251
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:39,720
Oh my God.

1252
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:45,720
I literally thought they were like mice.

1253
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:46,720
Yeah.

1254
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,720
Oh my God.

1255
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:48,720
What the frick?

1256
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:49,720
I'm going to pass.

1257
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:55,720
Um, Nidorina has some like bedroom eyes, but she's a little bit young

1258
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,720
for me for this one.

1259
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,720
So I'm going to pass.

1260
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:03,720
I can only think of that hamburger biscuit animation from a long time ago.

1261
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:04,720
Oh my God.

1262
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,720
They are like really cute.

1263
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:14,720
And like, every time I see her I think hamburger biscuit.

1264
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,720
Is that, is that a smash for you then?

1265
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:17,720
Yeah.

1266
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,720
Nidorina is a smash for me.

1267
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:20,720
Okay.

1268
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,720
I'll smash Nidorina too.

1269
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:26,720
We can, we can, we can visit Paris together with Nidorina.

1270
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:27,720
Yeah, we can.

1271
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,720
I feel it.

1272
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,720
Uh, Nidorina queen?

1273
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,720
Uh, she's a queen.

1274
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,720
Of course that's a smash.

1275
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:37,720
Uh, yeah.

1276
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:39,720
She looks like she got some tickle bitties.

1277
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:46,720
So I'm going to, I'll smash.

1278
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:51,720
This is also, I can't believe, I am literally mind blown that I did it.

1279
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:53,720
Fucking based off of rabbits.

1280
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:58,720
I'm like actually frustrated.

1281
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,720
I'm going to say no.

1282
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:03,720
Because again, baby, baby rabbit.

1283
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:07,720
So it's probably my distant relative.

1284
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:13,720
Did you know I'm canonically related to every bunny character in pop culture?

1285
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:14,720
Wow.

1286
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:15,720
Yeah.

1287
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:16,720
In some way shape or form.

1288
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:17,720
Mm-hmm.

1289
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,720
Very well connected.

1290
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:20,720
Yeah.

1291
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:31,720
I don't, it's just, it's a soft, it's a touchy subject for me, but, um, my mom, who is Jessica

1292
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:36,720
rabbit may have cheated on Roger rabbit with bugs to make me, but I'm not sure.

1293
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:37,720
I'm not sure.

1294
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:38,720
It's just a rumor.

1295
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:43,720
Honestly, I put that kind of just like that, that behind means moving on with my life,

1296
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:46,720
you know, not going to linger on it.

1297
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:47,720
Yeah.

1298
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:48,720
It's crazy.

1299
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:49,720
I guess I never knew.

1300
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:50,720
I'm so sorry.

1301
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:51,720
Yeah.

1302
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:52,720
Yeah.

1303
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:53,720
It's tough.

1304
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:54,720
Um, but I'm going to say pass.

1305
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:55,720
Yeah.

1306
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:56,720
I'm going to say pass.

1307
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:57,720
Yeah.

1308
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:58,720
He's on all fours.

1309
00:48:58,720 --> 00:48:59,720
That's a pass for me.

1310
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:00,720
He's up.

1311
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,720
Look at all those little ridges.

1312
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:03,720
I know.

1313
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:04,720
I know.

1314
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:05,720
Yeah.

1315
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,720
Wait, why is he on all fours and the arena?

1316
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:08,720
Is it?

1317
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,720
Because a lady doesn't crawl.

1318
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:15,720
That's a good say it louder for the people in the back.

1319
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,720
A lady doesn't crawl.

1320
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,720
I love that.

1321
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:23,720
Unless she wants to.

1322
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:25,720
Unless she wants to.

1323
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,720
Unless you ask politely.

1324
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:28,720
Exactly.

1325
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:29,720
Exactly.

1326
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:37,720
So he's a, he is low key a pass for me.

1327
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:38,720
Yeah.

1328
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:44,720
I feel it gives me like jock vibes, like football player vibes.

1329
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:48,720
But like a dick one, not like one of the nice sweet ones.

1330
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,720
Oh, like one who would take you under the bleachers and like.

1331
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:52,720
Yeah.

1332
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:53,720
Call you again.

1333
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:54,720
Exactly.

1334
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:55,720
Yeah.

1335
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:56,720
I'm good.

1336
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:57,720
I'm good.

1337
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:58,720
Yeah.

1338
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:02,720
I'm eating this.

1339
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,720
It looks so sweet.

1340
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,720
It's, it's cotton candy.

1341
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,720
I'm eating it.

1342
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:13,720
Um, I'm trying to think about how he would copulate if we tried, but I can't.

1343
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:17,720
So that's, I'm eating it.

1344
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:20,720
If I can't fuck it, I'm eating it.

1345
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:24,720
I mean, it would have metronome, you know, metronome might be worth it,

1346
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,720
but you never know what you're going to get.

1347
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:27,720
Yeah.

1348
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:30,720
I'd eat, I'd eat this one before I smash it.

1349
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:31,720
Okay.

1350
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:32,720
I'm safe pass.

1351
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,720
What about Clefable?

1352
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:38,720
Oh, that's a horse of a different color because he's bigger or she's bigger.

1353
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:39,720
I guess.

1354
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:40,720
Yeah.

1355
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,720
And she's throwing up gang signs.

1356
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:44,720
I know.

1357
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:45,720
Okay.

1358
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:47,720
Does that mean she's for the streets though?

1359
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:48,720
Like.

1360
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:49,720
Yes.

1361
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:50,720
Yes.

1362
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:51,720
She's for the streets.

1363
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:52,720
She's straight from the moon.

1364
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:53,720
She's for the streets.

1365
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:54,720
Yeah.

1366
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,720
I don't know if I want a girl from the streets.

1367
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:00,720
She'd be, I'm from the streets.

1368
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:01,720
Oh, no.

1369
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:03,720
That's not what I meant.

1370
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:07,720
She'd be, I'm from the streets.

1371
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:08,720
Oh, no.

1372
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:09,720
That's different.

1373
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:11,720
That's different.

1374
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:14,720
It's different.

1375
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:20,720
Um, I'd probably, you know, I'll let Clefable escape with her life.

1376
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:23,720
I'm not going to eat them because I need to consider it for longer,

1377
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:25,720
but I'll say pass for now.

1378
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:26,720
You know what?

1379
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:31,720
I'm going to say smash, but on the caveat that I can get a double team with Gengar

1380
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:32,720
with them.

1381
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:33,720
Ooh.

1382
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:36,720
That's, I like that.

1383
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:39,720
Then yes, it's a pass for me.

1384
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:40,720
Okay.

1385
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,720
It's a situational pass.

1386
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:43,720
Okay.

1387
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:44,720
I understand that.

1388
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,720
Um, bull picks.

1389
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:49,720
Oh, that's a baby.

1390
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:50,720
Yeah.

1391
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,720
I'm sure you don't, but I just want to snuggle it.

1392
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,720
Well, babe, I'm like, like the hair.

1393
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,720
Like the, so.

1394
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:58,720
That's a baby.

1395
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,720
I can't, I can't smash that.

1396
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:01,720
I can't eat it either.

1397
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:04,720
It doesn't really look that tasty.

1398
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:05,720
Just cute.

1399
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:09,720
Um, however I would eat, it's a lonely cousin.

1400
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:11,720
Oh hell yeah.

1401
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,720
That is, that is that good.

1402
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:14,720
It's no code.

1403
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:15,720
Oh hot.

1404
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:18,720
Just like a little bit of drizzle of your favorite syrup on that thing.

1405
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:19,720
Eating.

1406
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,720
That's going right in my mouth.

1407
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:22,720
100%.

1408
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:26,720
Um, smash, pass or four.

1409
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:28,720
Eating.

1410
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:34,720
So I'm going to pass nine tails.

1411
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:35,720
Smash.

1412
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:36,720
Smash.

1413
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:37,720
Smash.

1414
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:38,720
Smash.

1415
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,720
Smash.

1416
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:40,720
Smash.

1417
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:41,720
Oh God.

1418
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:42,720
A nine tails.

1419
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:43,720
All right.

1420
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:45,720
Don't even discuss it further.

1421
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:47,720
Uh, what about the Alolan version?

1422
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:50,720
That is an extra pretty one.

1423
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:51,720
Yeah.

1424
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:53,720
I, yeah, I'm going to agree with this.

1425
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:55,720
I feel like it would just be really sensual.

1426
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:58,720
Also they're wispy because they're like park ghosts.

1427
00:52:58,720 --> 00:52:59,720
So like, yeah.

1428
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,720
You know, I'm into it.

1429
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:05,720
Maybe they have, you know, a little something, something that only ghosts can do.

1430
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:06,720
Only ghost types can do.

1431
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:07,720
Um, jigglypuff.

1432
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,720
This is a piece of bubble gum.

1433
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:10,720
I know.

1434
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:15,720
Just like immediately it would like move to speak and I would just pick it up and

1435
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:16,720
pop it in my mouth.

1436
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:20,720
Um, so yeah, I'm going to pass and eat it.

1437
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,720
I'm, I'm boring this jigglypuff.

1438
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:26,720
I am chewing it like bubble gum and blowing.

1439
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:27,720
Yep.

1440
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,720
And it's a little, I bet, you know, I'd make it.

1441
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:30,720
I would freeze it.

1442
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:34,720
I'd freeze wiggly tough into one of those like SpongeBob popsicles because their

1443
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,720
eyes look like gumballs.

1444
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,720
And I would eat it like that.

1445
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,720
That's, that's what I would do for wiggly tough.

1446
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:41,720
Hmm.

1447
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:43,720
I'd only want to chew on the hair.

1448
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,720
I don't want to.

1449
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:45,720
I don't want to.

1450
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:46,720
I don't want to.

1451
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:47,720
I don't want to.

1452
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:48,720
Hmm.

1453
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,720
I'd only want to chew on the hair.

1454
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:51,720
Yeah.

1455
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:52,720
The rest is a pass.

1456
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:53,720
Okay.

1457
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:54,720
Understood.

1458
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:55,720
Understood.

1459
00:53:55,720 --> 00:54:01,220
You know, from a certain angle, his back foot looks like something else.

1460
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:02,720
So I did have to do a double take.

1461
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:03,720
Um.

1462
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:04,720
Yeah.

1463
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:05,720
I see what you're saying.

1464
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:06,720
Yeah.

1465
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:07,720
But no.

1466
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:08,720
Yeah.

1467
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:09,720
That's a foot.

1468
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:13,720
And I mean, his foot could go up there, but that's more of like a threat of violence

1469
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:14,720
at that point.

1470
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:15,720
Yeah.

1471
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,720
I feel like I'm just getting kicked in the crotch at that point.

1472
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:19,720
Zubat.

1473
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:22,720
That's a bat.

1474
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:23,720
Yeah.

1475
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:24,720
That's a straight up bat.

1476
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:29,720
Um, I don't even know what you could do with that because his legs are really fucking

1477
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:30,720
weird.

1478
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:31,720
It's all mouth.

1479
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:36,720
So maybe actually, maybe it's good of the, that the lingus of con.

1480
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:37,720
I don't know.

1481
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:38,720
You know.

1482
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:39,720
No, not this one.

1483
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:40,720
Not this one.

1484
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:41,720
Honestly.

1485
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:42,720
Honestly.

1486
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:45,720
I feel like this one might start a second pandemic.

1487
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:46,720
Okay.

1488
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:57,720
I'm passing the fuck out of that.

1489
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:59,720
I'm not even going to try to eat it.

1490
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:05,720
I'm not saying with gold bat because you said that I'm just scared.

1491
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:10,720
I just, I don't want to repeat on this.

1492
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:17,320
Uh, although gold bat's mouth is so tantalizing, but there's actually, I don't see a tongue

1493
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:18,320
in there.

1494
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:19,720
So yeah, I'm going to, we're passing.

1495
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:20,720
We're passing.

1496
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:23,720
I feel like he had tongues in the past though, right?

1497
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:24,720
Did he?

1498
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:25,720
I don't know.

1499
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:26,720
I'm Googling this.

1500
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:31,720
Cause I feel like gold bat, gold bat had a tongue in the past.

1501
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:34,720
I feel like you're right.

1502
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:39,220
The same thing happened to me when I was looking for a character with a black lip in like Hannah

1503
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:40,220
Barbera cartoons.

1504
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:46,220
And I know that bitch had a black lip, but when I looked her up ain't nothing but red

1505
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:47,220
lips.

1506
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:49,920
And I'm like, I swear I have like a red or pinkish or like purplish tongue.

1507
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:50,920
Oh my God.

1508
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:53,420
Is this like Mandela effect right now?

1509
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:54,420
I think we're in them.

1510
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:57,220
I think we're, I think someone shifted the universe like again.

1511
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:58,220
Yeah.

1512
00:55:58,220 --> 00:55:59,220
I'm pretty sure I agree with that.

1513
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:02,220
Cause I know this fucker had a tongue.

1514
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:03,220
Yeah.

1515
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:04,220
You're, you're right.

1516
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:05,220
I'm going to, I'm going to pass though.

1517
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:06,220
I like his little cat ears.

1518
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:09,220
His ears are so fucking small.

1519
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:14,220
It's like a little kitty cat with wing, wings for little hands.

1520
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:16,220
Um, yeah, this is a pass.

1521
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:17,220
Audish.

1522
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:19,220
He's kind of useless.

1523
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:21,220
Audish, I'm going to eat.

1524
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:22,220
I know you don't like vegetables.

1525
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:24,220
So I know you're, that's also a baby.

1526
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:26,220
So you're probably going to pass that.

1527
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:27,220
Yeah.

1528
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:28,220
I'm going to pass.

1529
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:31,220
He can stay in the little ground like a mandrake.

1530
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:33,220
I'm chopping up Audish.

1531
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:34,220
I'm sorry.

1532
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:37,220
I'm going into a really nice salad.

1533
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:38,220
Gloom.

1534
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:50,220
I mean, it looks like somebody already beat us to it.

1535
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:57,220
Oh my God.

1536
00:56:57,220 --> 00:56:59,220
I don't want sloppy seconds, man.

1537
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:05,220
I don't want whatever that is leaking out of Loom's mouth from somebody else anywhere

1538
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:07,220
near my business.

1539
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:11,220
And I'd probably trip and it'd probably be a bad trip or something and not have a good

1540
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:16,220
time from whatever things that would release spores.

1541
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:17,220
Jesus.

1542
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:18,220
Good.

1543
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:20,220
I'm not even eating that.

1544
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:21,220
Yeah.

1545
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:22,220
Fuck that.

1546
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:25,220
But it's already pre season.

1547
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:27,220
So would you?

1548
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:30,220
I mean, yeah, maybe.

1549
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:31,220
Okay.

1550
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:33,220
It's got berries on the top.

1551
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:35,220
So it's like part fruit.

1552
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:36,220
That's a good point.

1553
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:37,220
Those are berries.

1554
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:38,220
I forget.

1555
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:41,220
I always think they're like pods, like seed pods of some sort.

1556
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:43,220
So I try it at least once.

1557
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:48,220
And if the flavor didn't agree with me, I'd, you know, I'd never again.

1558
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:49,220
Understood.

1559
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:53,220
My chat is freaking out.

1560
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:56,220
I love it.

1561
00:57:56,220 --> 00:58:01,220
What about, what about Viola Plume?

1562
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:03,220
This gentleman can, can pass on.

1563
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:05,220
He can, he can leave.

1564
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:06,220
Yeah, I'm good.

1565
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:12,220
Uh, with the, the eyes, the expression, I'm kind of put off the head.

1566
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:18,220
Like I, the flower, it looks like a suction, but I don't think it does that.

1567
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:23,220
So are you reading chat?

1568
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:24,220
Yeah.

1569
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:30,220
Honestly, I feel like this Viola Plume is just tipping his flower, like my lady.

1570
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:31,220
Yeah.

1571
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:32,220
And that's so cool.

1572
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:33,220
No.

1573
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:34,220
It's a little cringe.

1574
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:35,220
I'm going to say pass.

1575
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:37,220
Also, he's kind of stinky.

1576
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:38,220
Yeah.

1577
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:40,220
Stinky, stinky little boy.

1578
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:42,220
Uh, pat us.

1579
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:46,220
I'm eating it because I love, I love shellfish.

1580
00:58:46,220 --> 00:58:49,220
Um, and literally my cat's food is going off.

1581
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:53,220
Um, so you're going to hear some cat munching.

1582
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:58,220
Um, but it literally comes with mushrooms to put on the side of the crab.

1583
00:58:58,220 --> 00:59:02,220
So I'm going to eat it.

1584
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:05,220
Oh, to answer, to answer the question, I'm trinket right now.

1585
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:06,220
Yeah.

1586
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:07,220
This is trinket.

1587
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:08,220
Nice.

1588
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:09,220
Nice to meet you.

1589
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:11,220
Um, Tomas, Tomas busy.

1590
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:13,220
So we have trinket.

1591
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:14,220
That's fine.

1592
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:15,220
Maybe next time.

1593
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:16,220
Yeah.

1594
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:17,220
Maybe next time.

1595
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:22,220
Um, so I'm going to pass.

1596
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:24,220
What about you for the crab?

1597
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:27,220
Um, I don't eat fish.

1598
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:28,220
Mm-hmm.

1599
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:31,220
So I'm going to say pass.

1600
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:32,220
Okay.

1601
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:33,220
But I would pet him.

1602
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:34,220
Yeah.

1603
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:36,220
I always like, like holding the little crabs, like hermit crabs.

1604
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:40,220
Like I would never eat a hermit crab, but like this looks more like a regular crab,

1605
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:42,220
but I would hold a hermit crab.

1606
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:45,220
Anyways.

1607
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:48,220
Parasect.

1608
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:52,220
Does it, is it just me or does he look like he have a really big happy smile?

1609
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:56,220
I was literally actually just thinking that and I couldn't tell if it was its mouth or

1610
00:59:56,220 --> 00:59:59,220
for it was like a section portion of the body.

1611
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:04,220
And now I'm like really wondering that in its eyes are dead.

1612
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:06,220
I just feel like it'll be brought in food.

1613
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:07,220
So I'm not going to eat it.

1614
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:11,220
Honestly, I just feel like he's about to open his big mouth Muppet style.

1615
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:14,220
He's going to be like, hi-ho, parasite here.

1616
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:19,220
Coming at you lie from smash or pass.

1617
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:23,220
Well, why don't you smash me?

1618
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:25,220
And I'm like, nope.

1619
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:28,220
I mean, look how big my mushroom is.

1620
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:30,220
I could plug you up real nice.

1621
01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:34,220
I don't know why he sounds so tiny like this.

1622
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:38,220
I'm for the swies, queens, if you know what I mean.

1623
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:39,220
It's dead.

1624
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:40,220
The mushroom is a parasite.

1625
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:41,220
Oh yeah.

1626
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:42,220
That's right.

1627
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:49,220
So it's really the mushroom puppeteering the crab.

1628
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:50,220
So I'm good.

1629
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:51,220
I don't want it.

1630
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:53,220
I don't want to turn into that.

1631
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:54,220
No, I'm good.

1632
01:00:54,220 --> 01:00:55,220
I don't know.

1633
01:00:55,220 --> 01:00:57,220
This is a left for dead situation.

1634
01:00:57,220 --> 01:01:00,220
Why did he turn into Sean Connery?

1635
01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:03,220
Hey, I'm Sean Connery.

1636
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:04,220
The Muppet.

1637
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:09,220
The Muppet Sean Connery.

1638
01:01:09,220 --> 01:01:10,220
The Venonette.

1639
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:11,220
He's so fluffy.

1640
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:12,220
I know.

1641
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:16,220
If I try to eat that, I feel like I would just choke like a hairball.

1642
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:17,220
So I'm good.

1643
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:18,220
Very cute.

1644
01:01:18,220 --> 01:01:19,220
Wood pet.

1645
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:20,220
Wood snuggle.

1646
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:21,220
Yeah.

1647
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:22,220
Yeah.

1648
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:26,220
I'm going to pass on this one and not eat it.

1649
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:27,220
Yeah.

1650
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:28,220
He's just too cute.

1651
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:29,220
Yeah.

1652
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:30,220
This little guy.

1653
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:32,220
I bet he's as delicate as a moth.

1654
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:33,220
Yeah.

1655
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:36,220
Oh, just like cradle them in their little hands.

1656
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:37,220
Yeah.

1657
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:38,220
Cute.

1658
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:39,220
Cute moths.

1659
01:01:39,220 --> 01:01:40,220
Cute moths.

1660
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:43,220
You know, I never understood why he turned so ugly.

1661
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:44,220
I know.

1662
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:47,220
It's fucking bug eyes.

1663
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:49,220
Why are you so ugly?

1664
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:50,220
I'm staring at you.

1665
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:53,220
I'm staring at you in my big eyes.

1666
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:54,220
Yeah.

1667
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:55,220
I'm not.

1668
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:57,220
I feel like it would just crawl into me and lay eggs.

1669
01:01:57,220 --> 01:02:01,220
And not even like Caterpie would crawl in and hang out.

1670
01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:02,220
And that's fine.

1671
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:03,220
It's already there.

1672
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:04,220
But I'm off.

1673
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:05,220
I'm good.

1674
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:06,220
Yeah.

1675
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:07,220
Caterpie's just cave exploring.

1676
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:08,220
Yeah.

1677
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:10,220
This creature would be trifling looking.

1678
01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:11,220
Yeah.

1679
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:12,220
Like.

1680
01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:14,220
Like, could you not?

1681
01:02:14,220 --> 01:02:17,220
I feel like that's like a Carlton.

1682
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:18,220
Not a Carlton.

1683
01:02:18,220 --> 01:02:20,220
Oracle voice.

1684
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:21,220
Excuse me.

1685
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:25,220
Why does everything sound the same for the voices of me?

1686
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:27,220
Did I do that?

1687
01:02:27,220 --> 01:02:30,220
Excuse me, my sweet madam.

1688
01:02:30,220 --> 01:02:35,220
Would you mind if I laid my eggs in your beautiful crevasse?

1689
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:36,220
Please.

1690
01:02:36,220 --> 01:02:37,220
Oh, please.

1691
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:39,220
Won't you let me?

1692
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:43,220
I'll let you ride my horn.

1693
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:49,220
I don't even mind if you get my wings wet, mistress.

1694
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:50,220
Yep.

1695
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:52,220
That's literally, that's the voice.

1696
01:02:52,220 --> 01:02:54,220
I'm passing.

1697
01:02:54,220 --> 01:02:56,220
I'm passing.

1698
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:57,220
Diglet.

1699
01:02:57,220 --> 01:02:58,220
Smash.

1700
01:02:58,220 --> 01:02:59,220
Smash.

1701
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:01,220
Going up my ass.

1702
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:04,220
I mean, I'm a front door girlie.

1703
01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:08,220
I'm, you know, I'm a front door girlie too, but like, I, like, I know a plug when I say

1704
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:09,220
what.

1705
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:12,220
I mean.

1706
01:03:12,220 --> 01:03:13,220
Yeah.

1707
01:03:13,220 --> 01:03:18,220
I'm, I'm, I'm riding that Diglet.

1708
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:19,220
Yeah.

1709
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:20,220
Of course.

1710
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:25,220
Until the, uh, the mill tanks come home, you know, you know what I'm saying?

1711
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:28,220
It even, it even has a button for the front, you know?

1712
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:29,220
Oh yeah.

1713
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:31,220
What's, what's Diglet's move set?

1714
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:32,220
I forget.

1715
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:33,220
Dig.

1716
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:35,220
Super.

1717
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:40,220
I mean, you could probably teach him tackle to it with your really desperate.

1718
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:41,220
That's right.

1719
01:03:43,220 --> 01:03:44,220
He needs to breathe.

1720
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:45,220
Don't worry about it.

1721
01:03:45,220 --> 01:03:48,220
He doesn't have to breathe where he's going.

1722
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:49,220
I'm smashing.

1723
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:50,220
Diglet.

1724
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:51,220
Oh.

1725
01:03:51,220 --> 01:03:55,220
This is just not the day.

1726
01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:58,220
This one has built in birth control.

1727
01:03:58,220 --> 01:04:01,220
What the f***ing IUT.

1728
01:04:01,220 --> 01:04:02,220
Yeah.

1729
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:13,220
I'll, I'll, I'll sit on this Diglet too.

1730
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:17,220
This one's for sharing with the homies.

1731
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:24,220
Like, um, you can ride one.

1732
01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:29,220
I can ride one and then we can get a friend to ride the other one.

1733
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:30,220
Did we have any...

1734
01:04:30,220 --> 01:04:33,220
I don't think I sit in, sit in the cock dirt.

1735
01:04:33,220 --> 01:04:35,220
Cock dirt.

1736
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:45,220
Are you okay?

1737
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:47,220
Are you okay?

1738
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:49,220
Are you okay?

1739
01:04:49,220 --> 01:04:52,220
F***ing cock dirt.

1740
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:53,220
Oh.

1741
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:58,220
Um, uh, or yeah.

1742
01:04:58,220 --> 01:04:59,220
Okay.

1743
01:04:59,220 --> 01:05:02,220
I'm, I'm smashing the trio.

1744
01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:09,220
Well, I just feel like you can't anymore with this one.

1745
01:05:09,220 --> 01:05:14,220
He really laid that lay so well.

1746
01:05:14,220 --> 01:05:23,220
I don't want to mess it up.

1747
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:25,220
Just because of the hair.

1748
01:05:25,220 --> 01:05:27,220
I don't, I don't.

1749
01:05:27,220 --> 01:05:28,220
That's a pass.

1750
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:29,220
That's a pass.

1751
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:30,220
I don't want to get it messy.

1752
01:05:30,220 --> 01:05:34,220
I don't want to snatch her, his or her wig or weave off.

1753
01:05:34,220 --> 01:05:37,220
He put down a whole paycheck for those three.

1754
01:05:37,220 --> 01:05:39,220
I'm not messing that up.

1755
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:41,220
I'm not, I'm not messing that up.

1756
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:42,220
No, not one bit.

1757
01:05:42,220 --> 01:05:47,220
Oh, accidentally moved my, I meant to move myself a little bit to the side.

1758
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:51,220
Um, Meowth, this is a cat.

1759
01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:52,220
That's a cat.

1760
01:05:52,220 --> 01:05:53,220
I can't eat it.

1761
01:05:53,220 --> 01:05:54,220
I can't eat it.

1762
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:55,220
I'm lighting the cat.

1763
01:05:55,220 --> 01:06:00,220
If I steal the gold, if the gold coin on its head is chocolate, then yes.

1764
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:05,220
Honestly, I just steal the whole cat and make him do payday every day.

1765
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:06,220
That's a good point.

1766
01:06:06,220 --> 01:06:09,220
So we are, we're, is this, is this our first Rob?

1767
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:11,220
Yeah, we're, we're robbing this one.

1768
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:12,220
We're robbing this one.

1769
01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:13,220
Okay.

1770
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:14,220
We robbed this one.

1771
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:16,220
We're going to take, we're taking the whole cat.

1772
01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:17,220
We're taking the whole cat.

1773
01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:18,220
We're robbing this cat.

1774
01:06:18,220 --> 01:06:19,220
We're stealing this cat.

1775
01:06:19,220 --> 01:06:24,220
Uh, uh, what about this long boy?

1776
01:06:24,220 --> 01:06:25,220
My interest.

1777
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:28,220
Straight to jail.

1778
01:06:28,220 --> 01:06:29,220
Don't.

1779
01:06:29,220 --> 01:06:31,220
I thought you said straight to jail.

1780
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:33,220
I thought you said straight to jail.

1781
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:34,220
Straight to tail.

1782
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:39,220
And I was, I'm like, what do you mean that tail?

1783
01:06:39,220 --> 01:06:44,220
I mean, what that tail do is like between me and the bedroom and that cat, but that's

1784
01:06:44,220 --> 01:06:46,220
not a, that's not a smash.

1785
01:06:46,220 --> 01:06:48,220
That's a smash and grab.

1786
01:06:48,220 --> 01:06:49,220
Yeah.

1787
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:50,220
Okay.

1788
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:51,220
I'm stealing this whole cat.

1789
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:52,220
That's not long.

1790
01:06:52,220 --> 01:06:53,220
Yeah.

1791
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:54,220
We're stealing.

1792
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:56,220
I feel like we could really shake some money out of him.

1793
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:57,220
Like, I don't know.

1794
01:06:57,220 --> 01:06:58,220
Okay.

1795
01:06:58,220 --> 01:06:59,220
Perfect.

1796
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:02,220
Uh, great googly moogly.

1797
01:07:02,220 --> 01:07:04,220
What the fuck is this thing?

1798
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:06,220
That is a man.

1799

01:07:54,220 --> 01:07:56,220
This one's pure sex.

1828
01:07:56,220 --> 01:07:58,220
I, I gotta agree that expression.

1829
01:07:58,220 --> 01:08:00,220
It's doing something to me.

1830
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:03,220
She, she really cute.

1831
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:05,220
She cute.

1832
01:08:05,220 --> 01:08:12,220
I think, and you know, I was debating whether or not if I should like bed her than rob her,

1833
01:08:12,220 --> 01:08:15,220
but I'm like, no, I feel like we'd have a good wine night stand.

1834
01:08:15,220 --> 01:08:19,220
I feel like she'd treat me to like dinner and like she'd pay, like I'd offer to pay

1835
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:20,220
like split pay.

1836
01:08:20,220 --> 01:08:23,220
And then we'd like be like, oh, maybe split and it's just, you would just pay it.

1837
01:08:23,220 --> 01:08:24,220
Um,

1838
01:08:24,220 --> 01:08:26,220
She looks like she would be a sugar mommy.

1839
01:08:26,220 --> 01:08:27,220
Yeah.

1840
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:28,220
I'll, I'll smash.

1841
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:29,220
Me too.

1842
01:08:29,220 --> 01:08:30,220
Yeah.

1843
01:08:30,220 --> 01:08:31,220

Ah, classic.

1845
01:08:33,220 --> 01:08:35,220
Classic Persian.

1846
01:08:35,220 --> 01:08:38,220
Classic Persian.

1847
01:08:38,220 --> 01:08:41,220
Cats of barbed penises.

1848
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:43,220
I mean.

1849
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:48,220
And I'm not averse to a little pain.

1850
01:08:48,220 --> 01:08:52,220
I mean, I'm gonna say smash because I've always liked Persian.

1851
01:08:52,220 --> 01:08:53,220
Same.

1852
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:56,220
Like, they just have that really nice sleek look.

1853
01:08:56,220 --> 01:08:57,220
Yeah.

1854
01:08:57,220 --> 01:08:59,220
How do you know that?

1855
01:08:59,220 --> 01:09:04,220
Because I have cats.

1856
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:05,220
Oh, great.

1857
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:08,220
People are going to be like, she be fucks her cat.

1858
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:09,220
No.

1859
01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:11,220
Stop that right now.

1860
01:09:11,220 --> 01:09:15,220
There's a difference between a Pokemon and a real animal.

1861
01:09:15,220 --> 01:09:16,220
Yeah.

1862
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:17,220
Jesus Christ.

1863
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:19,220
Whoopie is my little baby boy.

1864
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:23,220
And like, we've all, we've all read comic books.

1865
01:09:23,220 --> 01:09:27,220
Where there's like a handsome cat man.

1866
01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:30,220
No, I was thinking that's what you said.

1867
01:09:30,220 --> 01:09:32,220
She doesn't.

1868
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:34,220
She doesn't.

1869
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:39,220
I mean, I mean, and Persians about as smooth as the cat returns Baron.

1870
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:42,220
Oh, but I love Baron from the cat returns.

1871
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:46,220
He was my first crush on an anime character.

1872
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:49,220
That's because he's so charming.

1873
01:09:49,220 --> 01:09:50,220
All right.

1874
01:09:50,220 --> 01:09:52,220
I want to smash Persian.

1875
01:09:52,220 --> 01:09:53,220
Me too.

1876
01:09:53,220 --> 01:10:01,220
This is what sugar mommy turns into after the age of 60.

1877
01:10:01,220 --> 01:10:02,220
I'm okay.

1878
01:10:02,220 --> 01:10:05,220
I'm okay with this cougar.

1879
01:10:05,220 --> 01:10:06,220

1880
01:10:06,220 --> 01:10:07,220
I smash her.

1881
01:10:07,220 --> 01:10:08,220
You smash her?

1882
01:10:08,220 --> 01:10:09,220
Okay.

1883

01:10:12,220 --> 01:10:13,220
Yeah.

1885
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:14,220
She got the roastie voice.

1886
01:10:14,220 --> 01:10:16,220
She's like, Hey, sugar.

1887
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:20,220
You want to have like a mattress full of bills for you.

1888
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:21,220
Yeah.

1889
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:27,220
Like you, like you don't know what she even does for her money because she just like lives

1890
01:10:27,220 --> 01:10:28,220
so oddly.

1891
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:32,220
Like you'd think she's like, you're like, is she a drug dealer?

1892
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:36,220
Like why is she like, how do you like, she's not like elegant.

1893
01:10:36,220 --> 01:10:38,220
No, but she does live in decadence.

1894
01:10:38,220 --> 01:10:39,220
Yeah.

1895
01:10:39,220 --> 01:10:42,220
That's 100% very often.

1896
01:10:42,220 --> 01:10:43,220
Oh yeah.

1897
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:46,220
You don't see her for like months.

1898
01:10:46,220 --> 01:10:51,220
I know mama and she'll be like, I've been in Hawaii.

1899
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:53,220
Don't worry about it all.

1900
01:10:53,220 --> 01:10:55,220
Here's buy yourself something nice.

1901
01:10:55,220 --> 01:10:56,220
Here you go.

1902
01:10:56,220 --> 01:11:00,220
And it's like, hands you like a cool hundred.

1903
01:11:00,220 --> 01:11:02,220
And you don't question it.

1904
01:11:02,220 --> 01:11:03,220
Yeah.

1905
01:11:03,220 --> 01:11:04,220
Exactly.

1906
01:11:04,220 --> 01:11:05,220
Exactly.

1907
01:11:05,220 --> 01:11:11,220
Um, I probably steal the jewel in her head, but I'm going to pass.

1908
01:11:11,220 --> 01:11:12,220
I'm a smash.

1909
01:11:12,220 --> 01:11:13,220
Okay.

1910
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:14,220
Honestly, I understand.

1911
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:17,220
I totally understand that decision.

1912
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:19,220
Uh, side duck.

1913
01:11:19,220 --> 01:11:21,220
That's a duck.

1914
01:11:21,220 --> 01:11:22,220
That's a duck.

1915
01:11:22,220 --> 01:11:24,220
Uh, he doesn't know what the duck he's doing.

1916
01:11:24,220 --> 01:11:28,220
So yeah, I'm, I'm, I don't, I don't feel like fucking a duck.

1917
01:11:28,220 --> 01:11:30,220
That's confused all the time.

1918
01:11:30,220 --> 01:11:32,220
He's, he's always got headaches.

1919
01:11:32,220 --> 01:11:35,220
I would feel sorry for him more than anything.

1920
01:11:35,220 --> 01:11:36,220
Yeah.

1921
01:11:36,220 --> 01:11:39,220
I just like, I don't know if I'm out of his misery.

1922
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:40,220
Like duck is delicious.

1923
01:11:40,220 --> 01:11:41,220
Yeah.

1924
01:11:41,220 --> 01:11:42,220
I was debating whether or not to eat him.

1925
01:11:42,220 --> 01:11:43,220
I think I would.

1926
01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:48,220
Um, but I'm like, maybe, maybe if I let him, you know, bust a nut, like on my

1927
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:53,220
feet or something, like maybe it would like relieve some of that headache.

1928
01:11:53,220 --> 01:11:57,220
Have you ever like, you know, rubbed one out and just like relieve a headache.

1929
01:11:57,220 --> 01:11:58,220
Oh yeah.

1930
01:11:58,220 --> 01:11:59,220
All the time.

1931
01:11:59,220 --> 01:12:00,220
Yeah.

1932
01:12:01,220 --> 01:12:02,220
Exactly.

1933
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:03,220
Exactly.

1934
01:12:03,220 --> 01:12:07,220
So I feel like I wouldn't smash a duck.

1935
01:12:07,220 --> 01:12:08,220
I'd help him out.

1936
01:12:08,220 --> 01:12:09,220
Oh yeah.

1937
01:12:09,220 --> 01:12:14,220
Just like a quick pop to the back of the head and he's out of his misery, out of

1938
01:12:14,220 --> 01:12:15,220
the headache.

1939
01:12:15,220 --> 01:12:19,220
And then you, and then you have somebody cook them right up.

1940
01:12:19,220 --> 01:12:20,220
Yeah.

1941
01:12:20,220 --> 01:12:21,220
Okay.

1942
01:12:21,220 --> 01:12:22,220
Delicious.

1943
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:23,220
Perfect.

1944
01:12:23,220 --> 01:12:24,220
Yeah.

1945
01:12:24,220 --> 01:12:25,220
Okay.

1946
01:12:25,220 --> 01:12:26,220
Yeah.

1947
01:12:26,220 --> 01:12:27,220
I'm going to pass, but I like this plan.

1948
01:12:27,220 --> 01:12:28,220
Oh my God.

1949
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:29,220
Oh gosh.

That gym is just tend to actually, uh, yeah.

1955
01:12:40,220 --> 01:12:44,220
I don't really see like the tails are a little bit tantalizing sometimes, but

1956
01:12:44,220 --> 01:12:47,220
I'm going to say no.

1957
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:49,220
Yeah, like, I don't.

1958
01:12:49,220 --> 01:12:53,220
I've always wanted, like what the heck is gold ducks texture of their skin?

Like, are they like smooth?

1960
01:12:55,220 --> 01:13:01,700
smooth are they soft because like Psyduck looks a little like a little bit feathery but like Golda

1961
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:10,660
looks slimy and early yeah like he's well moisturized but like he's still wet from the lotion feeling

01:15:29,780 --> 01:15:33,540
else i don't know what the fuck this is but i'm not eating it it looks like spicy though

1980
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:40,980
he does look a little spicy he's from uh the the prequel game yeah yeah that's right honestly

1981
01:15:40,980 --> 01:15:48,500
he doesn't look as soft or as inviting as his as his uh as his descendant yeah he also has like

1982
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:54,740
i can't tell if he only has two he only has two claws on the front well they all do wait i never

1983
01:15:54,740 --> 01:16:00,340
know stuff before why did i think they're all paws what the heck is wrong with me uh i'm gonna pass

1984
01:16:01,380 --> 01:16:08,260
same however arcanine is what i was gonna get to yes that's a smash that's a smash we are smashing

1985
01:16:08,260 --> 01:16:16,180
arcanine thank you yeah okay i'm not gonna i'm not elaborating however i'm not gonna smash its

1986
01:16:16,980 --> 01:16:24,100
the creepy uncle arc i don't know i'd smash the creepy uncle he just looks like he smokes a lot

1987
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:29,940
and reeks of cigarettes okay but i like the smell of cigarette smoke okay you know to each

1988
01:16:29,940 --> 01:16:36,660
their own i might i might watch that one i might take my turn um and watch and send the the cock dirt

1989
01:16:41,540 --> 01:16:46,580
and then watch that take place just i mean i don't i don't think there's anything wrong but i do it

1990
01:16:46,580 --> 01:16:53,380
because like as you know i'm i'm a dog that's true you are a dog i'm a bunny so i might get a little

1991
01:16:53,380 --> 01:17:00,100
broken but it is one of this sometimes i get mistaken for a horse and it's fine though i mean

1992
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:06,900
because we don't have to elaborate on what he's packing yeah uh although i am thinking about it

1993
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:15,140
i kind of want to describe it for chat but i'm not gonna say it oh god i kind of want you to

1994
01:17:15,540 --> 01:17:25,060
what's the time sample got it out okay 117 go ahead okay so

1995
01:17:26,340 --> 01:17:31,140
because like all i can think of like it might be like a grotesque chili pepper but like it's

1996
01:17:31,140 --> 01:17:37,940
probably not that bad okay there are so many toys based off of you know the canine anatomy

1997
01:17:38,180 --> 01:17:47,940
yeah yeah uh-huh what would like the the color be like would it be like that orange or well for

1998
01:17:47,940 --> 01:17:54,500
a creepy uncle i imagine it would be like black like ebony black okay but for like but for like the

1999
01:17:54,500 --> 01:18:01,860
original it would be like chili pepper red i agree with that statement yep um

2000
01:18:04,660 --> 01:18:06,740
moving on moving on

2001
01:18:09,700 --> 01:18:16,340
uh polywag uh polywag going into my mouth nowadays

2002
01:18:19,540 --> 01:18:21,220
what are the movesets for polywag

2003
01:18:21,220 --> 01:18:30,660
it's a squirt so like is polywag just gonna squirt on me like i'm just i just kind of want to eat it

2004
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:38,660
i could definitely see it being used as a plug but pound oh it uses pound

2005
01:18:40,740 --> 01:18:48,180
i'm like it probably knows like hypnosis pound hypnosis water gun okay you know what

2006
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:56,100
i'll fuck it then eat it yeah also i'll smash and then you're gonna season it yourself and

2007
01:18:56,100 --> 01:19:03,140
then cook it exactly exactly you know i'd probably i'd probably just fuck it and let it live in a

2008
01:19:03,140 --> 01:19:09,620
pond backyard okay and then like call on it when you need to well yeah because he's gonna get stronger

2009
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:17,060
and bigger yeah that's a good point so i might i might keep a couple some for eating and some for

2010
01:19:17,060 --> 01:19:19,780
other things might might maybe i'll farm them

2011
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:26,500
the fuck a polywag farm

2012
01:19:31,460 --> 01:19:36,260
this is a brothel full of polywags okay what about poly world

2013
01:19:37,140 --> 01:19:46,180
oh what about poly world that's clearly a smash yeah like he looks like he could do like

2014
01:19:46,180 --> 01:19:53,780
some real good damage like some riona damage and then like some good aftercare yeah i feel like he

2015
01:19:53,780 --> 01:19:57,940
could like hypnotize you to make the pain go away but like you can still like look at the bruises

2016
01:19:57,940 --> 01:20:03,780
and be like oh this was nice you know yeah you know what yeah i like that because you know i'm a

2017
01:20:03,780 --> 01:20:10,180
i'm a riona girl myself so um and like however i'm not into fisting too much so i just i would just

2018
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:16,740
ask he like i'd hope that you respect my boundaries for that you know yeah cool okay i'll

2019

2021
01:20:29,380 --> 01:20:35,780
point i kind of like the smug expression gloves off yeah he means business now gloves off

2022
01:20:36,020 --> 01:20:42,740

2032
01:21:56,420 --> 01:21:59,300

2084
01:28:06,340 --> 01:28:20,980
what we're talking about no no you know you want to you come on bell sprout i mean look at that

2085
01:28:20,980 --> 01:28:26,900
that's that's like that's like i'm sorry like my favorite toy is a rose so i was just gifted

2086
01:28:26,900 --> 01:28:32,500
something similar to a rose recently and i have yes i saw that i you should definitely use that i

2087
01:28:32,580 --> 01:28:44,500
think you'll enjoy yourself um uh yeah i feel like it has uses for both genders

2088
01:28:45,220 --> 01:28:51,380
yeah he's definitely an accomplice in the bedroom yeah like say you have company over and you're

2089
01:28:51,380 --> 01:28:56,180
like you want to get you want to do something frisky freaky and they're like sure and instead of doing

2090
01:28:56,180 --> 01:29:00,420
like the grapefruit technique you just went out of bell sprout yeah i just like pull it out of the

2091
01:29:00,420 --> 01:29:06,100
side drawer and then and then it makes those noises like inappropriate popsicles noise yeah

2092
01:29:07,780 --> 01:29:16,500
inappropriate popsicle noises uh i like someone also pointed out that bell sprout is 69 so i i

2093
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:22,180
thought that was funny too they knew what they were doing they knew what they were doing um i'm

2094
01:29:22,180 --> 01:29:28,340
gonna say yes i'm gonna smash bell sprout well i wouldn't be usually smashing i'm kind of just

2095
01:29:28,340 --> 01:29:41,060
like using it because i mean yeah the bell sprouts okay but what about weeping bell it gets a little

2096
01:29:41,060 --> 01:29:49,060
bit bigger again that's suction like i know the next one has teeth so i would say no but this one

2097
01:29:49,060 --> 01:29:53,060
i will say i would cover the eyes because i don't get some looking at me

2098
01:29:53,060 --> 01:29:59,620
you know it's not multiple you can have one for the top and for the titties

2099
01:30:00,660 --> 01:30:08,580
oh and just like put one on each tittie and then like have a third just be like yeah yeah i don't

2100
01:30:08,580 --> 01:30:19,940
care if it's spits acid it's going on my clitoris think of it as a chemical peel yeah it's like a

2101
01:30:20,900 --> 01:30:23,940
uh uh what is that like the vegesals like the badge

2102
01:30:26,180 --> 01:30:31,540
let's put that on there you know exfoliating i'm gonna smash victory bell however i'm good

2103
01:30:33,940 --> 01:30:38,660
um i don't want to climb inside i bet it would be really comfy yeah how big is a is a victory bell

2104
01:30:38,660 --> 01:30:44,980
i feel like they're about people's eyes james would often get eaten by his yeah okay that's a good point

2105
01:30:45,780 --> 01:30:49,460
he's probably got a stem inside that you could probably ride on maybe

2106
01:30:51,220 --> 01:30:54,180
i just feel like i feel like a guy would look at that and be like you know

2107
01:30:55,940 --> 01:30:58,340
i like a challenge because of those teeth on the edge

2108
01:31:00,020 --> 01:31:04,580
but then again you could use those to climb out if you're inside that's a good point we would have

2109
01:31:04,580 --> 01:31:11,860
to have a lot of communication in like boundary setting i feel like communication would be hard

2110
01:31:11,940 --> 01:31:18,740
if you're inside of its mouth like yeah i can't understand you yeah i'm gonna pass i'm gonna

2129
01:33:24,420 --> 01:33:31,540
just be very uncomfortable he's always hard that's a good point but if you if you if you went into

2130

people like hello malady and like invite me to his castle oh yeah yeah i feel like

2160
01:37:05,140 --> 01:37:08,740
i'm just thinking of so many scenarios where he just treats me right like a princess

2161
01:37:09,700 --> 01:37:16,260
like he'll carry you yeah oh yeah although he's like although when i see him i kind of

2162
01:37:16,260 --> 01:37:21,460
think unicorn rules where they're only attracted to virgins oh that's a good point

2163
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:27,460
but you know that's fine maybe he's different yeah maybe he doesn't judge maybe he doesn't judge

2164
01:37:28,260 --> 01:37:30,740
i can't relate because obviously i'm a virgin so

2165
01:37:31,140 --> 01:37:39,540
um of course madame of course um i'm a good christian girl um of course

2166
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:48,500
slow poke alternate none outfit win i don't i want a non outfit so fucking bad

2167
01:37:49,940 --> 01:37:54,500
i want one so bad there's like one like one those little dress up ones on booth and i'm like

2168
01:37:54,500 --> 01:37:59,220
i need to snag that

2169
01:38:02,020 --> 01:38:09,220
confess i'm not gonna lie are you gonna smash slow poke is a smash and eat i'm just gonna eat

2170
01:38:09,220 --> 01:38:16,340
i'm not smashing but what tell me why explain well i just love slow poke because like you know

2171
01:38:16,340 --> 01:38:21,060
he's not gonna finish like the same time as you so you can get off as many times and then he'll have

2172
01:38:21,060 --> 01:38:26,420
like his delayed reaction and so he'll he'll last longer than like your typical pokemon because

2173
01:38:26,420 --> 01:38:32,980
he's always slow on the update yeah that's a good point that's a good point i think i'm going to

2174
01:38:32,980 --> 01:38:39,220
sit in the cuck dirt for them because i kind of want because because i kind of want to see how

2175
01:38:39,220 --> 01:38:46,580
you do it and then maybe you know because he takes forever i can like have my turn and then we can

2176
01:38:46,660 --> 01:38:53,220
consume him afterwards oh yeah season and then consume yeah like two little you know

2177
01:38:53,220 --> 01:38:59,300
spiders and then like we don't even have to eat the whole thing just the tail yeah because i heard

2178
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:05,780
that the tail is a delicacy so i guess i'm gonna click on smash alongside you for that one

2179
01:39:07,220 --> 01:39:12,100
and of course it's like the same for this golden one i don't know this one looks a little bit sickly

2180
01:39:12,100 --> 01:39:19,940
to me i don't know i feel like he's got extra flavor extra flavor okay i'll let you have that one

2181
01:39:19,940 --> 01:39:28,580
i'm gonna pass yeah i'm gonna smash what about slow bro though he's on he's on two legs how am

2182
01:39:28,580 --> 01:39:42,100
i not smashing that i think i'm gonna pass because the spininess of the shell

2183
01:39:43,220 --> 01:39:49,540
i feel like it would get in the way i just feel like it would get in the way like like imagine

2184
01:39:49,540 --> 01:39:55,220
he like he turns around or like he just like accidentally bumps you with it like ow you know

2185
01:39:55,300 --> 01:40:01,700
like yeah he's watching i mean the shell's getting a free show at that point and i could care less

2186
01:40:01,700 --> 01:40:09,540
yeah you know i'm not obviously i don't care if i'm watched but um yeah i just i don't know

2191
01:40:37,300 --> 01:40:44,260
chastity shell well i so because it's a chastity shell i can't smash but yes i guess i guess i

2192
01:40:44,340 --> 01:40:47,140
can consider him one of my good little boy sluts i'll i'll say

2193
01:40:49,300 --> 01:40:53,540
he would like that he would like to be a good yeah um

2194
01:40:56,420 --> 01:41:01,460
are you what about this one i don't know he's got smelly fingers

2195
01:41:05,060 --> 01:41:09,460
he looks like he kind of like don't know doesn't know how he got into this predicament

2196
01:41:10,020 --> 01:41:18,020
um like he like he just looks like he doesn't wash his hands yeah yeah i agree with this

2197
01:41:19,060 --> 01:41:23,220
i'm just gonna i'm gonna pass i'm gonna pass

2198
01:41:26,020 --> 01:41:36,100
uh magnumite uh smash smash does it vibrate like it's got to if you get like some other magnets

2199
01:41:36,180 --> 01:41:41,460

2200
01:41:44,900 --> 01:41:48,500
you know i'll say yes i'll say yes just because i can play with his knobs

2201
01:41:49,380 --> 01:41:55,460
you can play with his knobs and i feel like little zapping would be cool so i'm gonna smash

2202
01:41:56,580 --> 01:42:04,020
yeah and then for magneton it's kind of the same thing you just have more pals to play with

2203
01:42:04,020 --> 01:42:10,900
you know that's the group activity yeah like that was the the this is the main course that was

2204
01:42:10,900 --> 01:42:18,100
the one before was the appetizer like you could play never have i ever with this one and whoever

2205
01:42:18,100 --> 01:42:28,100
had gets his app yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna smash and then like if you undo the screws you can have

2206
01:42:28,100 --> 01:42:33,140
like three of them yeah did you want to do you want to tag team on that one with me

2207
01:42:33,860 --> 01:42:37,940
sure i'll tag yeah i feel like that would just be a really fun time just like a couple of

2208
01:42:37,940 --> 01:42:42,500
friends hanging out we can have some drinks and you know play a couple of games like like you said

2209
01:42:43,060 --> 01:42:52,580
i'd be fun i like that casual pokemon get together exactly um so i know this one's a bird

2210
01:42:52,660 --> 01:42:58,260
but he's a very handsome bird uh he came and brought his own vegetable i'm cooking him

2211
01:43:00,340 --> 01:43:07,140
i'm i'm smashing him okay i'm eating him if you want to season him for me that's fine

2212
01:43:08,020 --> 01:43:15,060
yeah i don't want to season it for you okay yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna eat it however

2213
01:43:15,940 --> 01:43:27,700
the next one has a certain je ne sais quoi and that's fresh yeah like i don't know why but i'm

2214
01:43:27,700 --> 01:43:36,020
getting like berserk vibes like you've got guts yeah he's like the big big sword you know that

2215
01:43:36,020 --> 01:43:42,500
express i don't i want to i think i might smash like he looks at you over his shoulders like

2216
01:43:42,500 --> 01:43:54,100
stand back stand back or i guess he wouldn't call you a kitten he'd probably say

2217
01:43:54,100 --> 01:43:59,380
stand back duckling yeah that's cute that's actually cute as hell if he called me as duckling

2218
01:44:00,100 --> 01:44:08,900
i'm gonna yeah i'm smashing this one um i don't even want to eat that

2219
01:44:09,620 --> 01:44:16,980
uh that's a pass for me yeah it's a pass because he looks dusty yeah yeah

2220
01:44:18,500 --> 01:44:25,860
like scratchy feeling like it's not like feathers it's like scratchy fur or like a mixture of like

2221
01:44:25,860 --> 01:44:36,740
hair like um like a like really itchy hey uh sama dodrio yeah also they fight all the time

2222
01:44:37,380 --> 01:44:42,020
i was yeah i was gonna say i'm like i feel like they would just argue about like what to do next

2223
01:44:42,020 --> 01:44:47,940
and i'm not in the mood for that yeah yeah like i would hang out with that third head but that's

2224
01:44:47,940 --> 01:44:52,020
not yeah like have a chat with them just be like forget the other guys like let's just hang out

2225
01:44:52,580 --> 01:44:59,380
just pretend it's us it's a seal this is a seal i can't tell if i want to eat it or not but so

2226
01:44:59,380 --> 01:45:05,540
because of that i'll spare it i'm gonna spare it as well because like i know seals always get a

2227
01:45:05,540 --> 01:45:13,220
bad rap especially since i have this have they stopped the clubbings oh my gosh i think they

2228
01:45:13,220 --> 01:45:19,860
i think they did like crack down on that like clubbing baby seals good i'm gonna spare him yeah

2229
01:45:19,860 --> 01:45:24,500
i don't want to eat or smash him same um dugong is so cute

2230
01:45:26,900 --> 01:45:32,900
but i feel like maneuvering in the bedroom would be difficult she's a lady

2231
01:45:33,460 --> 01:45:40,500
i don't i just want to take her out you know like we're a good time take her dancing yeah

2232
01:45:43,620 --> 01:45:49,300
like are we gonna go in the water yeah like secret nice swimming like take her to a local pool

2233
01:45:49,300 --> 01:45:56,180
want to be like a dolphin moment if it was a male do okay not like that type of dolphin moment

2234
01:45:57,060 --> 01:46:02,740
i fucking hate dolphins they are pretty shitty they're really shitty creatures they're smart but

2235
01:46:04,740 --> 01:46:10,100
that's what makes them shitty is that they know what they do yeah i'm gonna say pass i'd probably

2236
01:46:10,100 --> 01:46:18,260
just take her out yeah and then become like friends like if i were a guy with the equipment it

2237
01:46:18,260 --> 01:46:26,580
probably be a oh hundred percent like there's a lot of the ones like i remember um didn't you like

2238
01:46:26,580 --> 01:46:33,300
with with the other uh the other girl that you did this with um that one weird cat uh didn't you

2239
01:46:33,300 --> 01:46:40,900
guys also do like a penis envy version as well oh right right right yeah penis envy one yeah i think

2240
01:46:40,900 --> 01:46:45,460
we should also like sneak that in so i'll say like i i definitely have penis envy for this one if i

2241
01:46:45,460 --> 01:46:51,700
was a dude i'd take my skull you know as a madame i'll take my strap and you know i guess then that

2242
01:46:51,700 --> 01:47:03,220
means i smash because i can just use a strap okay um grimer you know i feel like he could get into

2243
01:47:03,220 --> 01:47:11,060
crevices ew but like doesn't he like poison type like i just feel like i'd never stopped me before

2258
01:48:45,140 --> 01:48:54,420
like that gesture it's just like really aggressive but muck spelled backwards is a good point maybe

2259
01:48:54,420 --> 01:49:01,300
maybe my uh if i was a dude i'd like give it a shot because i feel like i mean everybody knows

2264
01:49:28,020 --> 01:49:32,980

Happens to the best of us. It's like when we had one one too many drinks, you know

01:51:11,100 --> 01:51:13,300
You wake up somebody didn't expect

2281
01:51:14,420 --> 01:51:16,420

2287
01:51:38,100 --> 01:51:43,140
Like I don't even worry. I'm not even worried about his ghost equipment. He's got like three out of

2288
01:51:44,100 --> 01:51:46,100
Three out of four. Yeah

2289
01:51:46,820 --> 01:51:51,060
Yeah, that's a little bagged smash. That's a Gengar. Yeah, that's a Gengar

2290
01:51:53,060 --> 01:51:54,380
Come on

Did you want to get to a hundred and then wind down it's like a little bit chatting. Yeah, cool. Okay, so smash Gengar

2292
01:52:03,580 --> 01:52:05,580
What the fuck is this

01:52:06,900 --> 01:52:08,900
Gengar mega

2294
01:52:11,220 --> 01:52:13,220
They look like punches

2295
01:52:13,580 --> 01:52:18,660
Yeah, I can't really tell what's going on here, I'm gonna pass

2296
01:52:19,460 --> 01:52:24,780
I'm confused. I love the expression like, you know, I feel like we'd have crazy wild

2297
01:52:25,420 --> 01:52:31,300
You know smashing this but I just yeah, I'm a little bit confused. So I'm gonna pass

2298
01:52:34,460 --> 01:52:37,100
He's rolling out the red carpet for you baby girl

2299
01:52:37,300 --> 01:52:44,740
Literally, do you I feel like how big is Gengar Gigantamax? Because I feel like each one of us can take each side of that tongue

2300
01:52:46,460 --> 01:52:50,100
And we can do the same thing that we would do for the Gigantamax

2301
01:52:51,620 --> 01:52:52,980
My champ

2302
01:52:52,980 --> 01:53:00,460
Yeah, I think I think so. That's a smash. Yeah. Yeah. He's a haunted carnival, right? You're correct

2303
01:53:00,780 --> 01:53:02,780
Where are we are smashing?

2304
01:53:03,380 --> 01:53:06,980
Yes, we are smashing this this carnival, right? Mm-hmm

2305
01:53:07,620 --> 01:53:09,620
That's a rock

2306
01:53:10,780 --> 01:53:20,020
This is a collective group of rocks like I want to smash this like really bad, but again Onyx is giant

2307
01:53:21,380 --> 01:53:23,380
and

2308
01:53:23,780 --> 01:53:25,780
Like I couldn't use him for like

2309
01:53:26,860 --> 01:53:28,460
plugging stuff

2310
01:53:28,460 --> 01:53:32,980
No, this is like a group effort. You'd have to get like a whole party to try to contact

2311
01:53:32,980 --> 01:53:38,140
Yeah, exactly. So I'm gonna pass just for my own safety

2312
01:53:41,460 --> 01:53:44,860
It's drowsy. It's every hypno-comics

2313
01:53:46,300 --> 01:53:51,220
I feel like yeah, I feel like he would just make me do the most depraved shit

2314
01:53:51,340 --> 01:53:55,500
But not even like the fun stuff like look how like, you know, see his bottom half

2315
01:53:56,460 --> 01:53:58,900
You know, he's into some chocolate play

2316
01:53:58,900 --> 01:54:00,900
Oh

2317
01:54:01,180 --> 01:54:06,940
So he's got that weird elephant. No, yeah, like you just know he's gonna be like hey

2318
01:54:06,940 --> 01:54:11,100
That's just feel good. He's just all snuffling for truffles up in you. Yeah, I just

2319
01:54:11,740 --> 01:54:17,540
It's gross like ugly ugly bastard and like but this isn't like a good ugly bastard, you know, there's good

2320
01:54:18,100 --> 01:54:23,380
So I'm gonna I'm good. Yeah pass. It's not like Venus or yeah

2321
01:54:24,220 --> 01:54:27,220
Yeah, I would prefer Venus or over him

2322
01:54:27,860 --> 01:54:31,220
Hypno again, however that knows

2323
01:54:36,500 --> 01:54:39,820
I'm I'm looking at that nose and you know

2324
01:54:48,820 --> 01:54:55,540
But I was gonna say one of my favorite songs the Humpty dance from digital underground

2325
01:54:57,220 --> 01:55:02,460
One of the lines is in a 69. My Humpty nose will tickle your rear and

2326
01:55:03,580 --> 01:55:05,580
I

2327
01:55:05,700 --> 01:55:07,700
Kind of like that

2328
01:55:09,340 --> 01:55:11,620
So any is five fingers

2329
01:55:14,380 --> 01:55:18,780
Our 34 artists a sample are you smashing?

2330
01:55:21,900 --> 01:55:23,900
Are you gonna sit in the dirt for that one

2331
01:55:24,380 --> 01:55:26,980
No, I I'm really torn

2332
01:55:26,980 --> 01:55:31,260
I just feel like I'd like him better if he took a nap first because he just looks tired

2333
01:55:31,380 --> 01:55:33,380
Yeah, do you think he wouldn't like try as hard?

2334
01:55:34,220 --> 01:55:38,780
Yeah, I don't think he would try as hard because he knows he could just put you under like hypnosis

2335
01:55:38,780 --> 01:55:42,900
Oh, you're like a really lazy lover. That's true. And then he could be like, oh, yeah

2336
01:55:42,900 --> 01:55:48,460
We totally did stuff and he'd be like, oh, I really and then you like actually nothing happens. It's just really just yeah

2337
01:55:49,220 --> 01:55:52,660
Like he puts you down he made it he gave you the suggestion

2338
01:55:52,660 --> 01:55:58,380
Oh, you felt really good during our time together and he's just sitting there reading the newspaper. Yeah. Yeah, just like

2339
01:56:00,180 --> 01:56:02,180
Just like writing on the belly

2340
01:56:03,700 --> 01:56:05,700
Nothing

2341
01:56:05,900 --> 01:56:08,900
And then he brings you up and he's like was it good for you?

2342
01:56:19,340 --> 01:56:25,500
I think I'm okay that like I think I've been convinced I don't think I want hip-no anymore

2343
01:56:32,060 --> 01:56:37,380
Oh, yeah, I don't yeah, I'm a pass I'm eating this crab

2345
01:56:45,180 --> 01:56:46,980

2351
01:57:11,940 --> 01:57:13,940

01:57:17,620 --> 01:57:19,620
Like a bubble beard

2353
01:57:20,100 --> 01:57:23,540
Because it looks like it's like king crab legs a hundred percent my favorite

2354
01:57:24,820 --> 01:57:26,820

Like how could you not how could you not smash?

2357
01:57:35,620 --> 01:57:38,120
Both are like so multi-purpose

2358
01:57:39,300 --> 01:57:41,460
Like you can write them you can

2359
01:57:42,660 --> 01:57:44,660
That's it

2360
01:57:44,900 --> 01:57:46,660
No, I think you could make

2361
01:57:46,660 --> 01:57:50,180
No, wait, how big is Voltorb because I'm like, could I pop them in? I don't think so

2362
01:57:50,420 --> 01:57:53,380
I don't like maybe a baby one if he was small

2363
01:57:53,540 --> 01:57:59,380
Yeah, maybe a smaller one and then I could use it use it as a like a little a little

2364
01:58:00,020 --> 01:58:02,020
You know

2365
01:58:02,500 --> 01:58:06,740
It doesn't that doesn't split apart. It doesn't have a mouth. The other one has a mouth

2366
01:58:07,620 --> 01:58:09,620
Yeah, the other one has the teeth. Yeah

2367
01:58:11,380 --> 01:58:13,380
Hmm

2368
01:58:14,340 --> 01:58:18,420
Aren't they the size of a pokeball? Well, it's going up my at no

01:58:31,140 --> 01:58:37,460
So like well like I guess what do they do they ever show what the incentive of pokeball looks like? I can't remember

2372
01:58:38,500 --> 01:58:41,460
Um, well, it's like suspended animation, isn't it?

2373
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:48,740
I like to think that it's a little environment. Yeah, I always like the picture. It's like they have like a whole ass house in there

2374
01:58:49,780 --> 01:58:52,900
I'd like to sit in a pokeball. I bet it'd be really comfy

2375
01:58:53,140 --> 01:58:59,700
Yeah, it's um the same thing as floor time. Do you think that like tomas tummy is like a like like a pokeball?

2376
01:59:00,660 --> 01:59:04,260
Oh, absolutely. Yeah, she can she can go in there herself. So that's pretty cool

2382
01:59:26,740 --> 01:59:28,740
Um, let's let's chat with

2383
01:59:29,380 --> 01:59:30,900
Chat with a harem

2384
01:59:30,900 --> 01:59:35,380
In some of your fans the paparazzi is here

2385
01:59:36,340 --> 01:59:38,340
Um

2386
01:59:43,460 --> 01:59:49,700
Do electrode electrode is like the same thing. Oh, what the fuck is this thing pass on the wooden version? I'm good. Um

01:59:52,900 --> 01:59:58,740
Yeah, he's got a cocky expression and I like it on his wooden version. All right. We're leaving off on eggs

2389
01:59:59,060 --> 02:00:01,060
Yeah

2390
02:00:03,620 --> 02:00:11,620

2391
02:00:13,220 --> 02:00:16,340
This is the most well-smashed pass I've seen yet

02:00:19,540 --> 02:00:21,300
Um

2393
02:00:21,300 --> 02:00:23,940
From the other perspective, that's true as a as a girl

2394
02:00:24,340 --> 02:00:28,740
Yeah, because I think like yeah markiplier has done like the most like famous one

2395
02:00:29,220 --> 02:00:31,220
Like the one has like so many views or whatever

2396
02:00:31,700 --> 02:00:36,420
Um, he's he's a dude. So it's a different perspective for us. Us girly pops out here

2397
02:00:37,300 --> 02:00:38,260
Yeah

2398
02:00:38,260 --> 02:00:40,260
