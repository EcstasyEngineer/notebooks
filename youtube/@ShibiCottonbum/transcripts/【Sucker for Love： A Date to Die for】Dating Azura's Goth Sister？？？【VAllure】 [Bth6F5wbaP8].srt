Hello, yes, we are nice and cozy. I have a cozy fear next to me

16
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:17,440
Hello, hi my day, how did my day go it's alright a lot of adulting adulting's dumb

17
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,280
Adulting is stupid

18
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,440
Go armpit for free it seems so

19
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,800
We're cozy today

20
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:36,600
We're gonna be playing some sucker for love, which has been super

21
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,400
Little popular semi-popular indie game

22
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,520
How are you you date

23
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,280
Eldritch gods and beings and this one you date

24
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,400
Some sort of a cult being

25
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,600
Which is very on theme for my summer ween

26
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,080
That summer ween

27
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,160
Get it. Um

28
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,080
But yeah

29
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:10,840
So yeah, we got to get those smooches. I've never played this before again

30
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:15,120
I'm the type of person who I just watch other people play things and I never play things for myself

31
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,640
Yeah, the first one I remember watching was really good I've seen

32
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,820
The demo of this but I haven't seen the full game and I know I think this is the full release

33
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:36,280
But yeah, I'm very excited to do it's very it's also on theme because it's a Zora's birthday this week. Yeah

34
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,560
So um, it's I'm very excited for a Zora's birthday

35
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,760
I'm excited to spend time with her and the girlies this weekend

36
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,000
With a little little collab

37
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,680
But yeah, this is this is an homage to a Zora in a kind of way

38
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:59,560
It just actually kind of really fit with the theme and also with her. So yeah, so make sure

39
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:06,280
When is there a streams you go check her out her link is my description below give her lots of love

40
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:13,600
But yeah, we call there being goat themed eldritch monster. This could be her again. I don't recall

41
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:19,000
I really like the design of her as we'll get into it. I've seen her design already

42
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,120
But yeah, I

43
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:29,240
Might be a little bit low energy today. I'm kind of tired. I'm also just kind of frustrated from adulting and silly stuff

44
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,640
But yeah, I just want to be honest and transparent with you guys

45
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:38,680
I'll be doing a little bit of voice acting today. I'll try to voice act all the characters to the best of my ability

46
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,760
I don't know if I can give her a Zora's voice

47
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,840
I I I just I have to like

48
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,600
Have a Zora speaking in my ear then I have to repeat after her for me to do the voice

49
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,380
But um, we'll we'll see

50
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,920
But yeah

51
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,160
Hopefully my day picks up. Thank you. I appreciate that

52
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,520
Boomi is currently behind me playing with this favorite toy, which is one of those spring toys

53
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,720
He is walking around with it in his mouth as we speak

54
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:12,240
He already knocked two onto the fridge that I gave him today, so I will have to retrieve those there's probably like 20 under there

55
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:19,520
Fia is napping. She just ate I gave her a piece of I was just eating a salmon rice bowl

56
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,480
During my waiting screen that I just made

57
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,040
So I gave her a little piece of salmon

58
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:30,960
With no with no seasoning or anything on it so she could have a little sneaky snack and she liked it. Hi Nori. Hi

59
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,840
Hello, everybody say hi to Nori Nori is my baby girl

60
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,880
She is one of my daughters her and Chai are my daughters if you haven't known

61
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,880
But yes and the more

62
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
But yeah, so

63
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,840
Yeah, I don't know I'm kind of kind of like I'm also I'll be honest with you

64
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,840
I'm also in a little bit of pain

65
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:59,400
From my fibro, so I'm just it's not like oh, I'm dying. Oh, it's so terrible flare up

66
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:03,440
Oh, it's just like I'm just feel sore for no reason though

67
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:09,440
All I've been doing is typing at a computer, so it doesn't make any sense, but you know, that's how life works

68
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,240
Cats love salmon. Yes. I always I could give Fia a little minnow

69
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:21,960
I think did I give her a minnow on stream before I give her freeze-dried minnows because my cats are very spoiled

70
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,000
It's funny boomie has these phases where he really likes them and then he doesn't like them

71
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,840
I'm like does it depend on who packaged it or all that I

72
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,400
Was gonna make a joke about you being a pain because I did

73
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,920
Thank you, Nori. No yet

74
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:45,760
I have this like weird pain going down from my shoulders to my elbows to my wrists again

75
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,680
It's all like joint related stuff

76
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,520
But I'll be fine. Don't worry about it. It'll go away. I just need to like I'll do some stretches

77
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,560
I've done some stretching already, you know, I just I just you know, it might hear me

78
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,240
Rattle my bones and crack my neck and crack a bunch of stuff

79
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:05,840
Yeah, I'm gonna I need to do some I don't know. Maybe I'll do something at home yoga or whatever. I

80
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,640
Feel like something's out of place to be honest with you. Like I feel like I need to like pop something

81
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,820
Oh, or I just have like bursa. I like I like bursitis in my shoulder. It's weird

82
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,160
Hello, hi

83
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,840
Hi, if you're new here, my name is she be caught in mom

84
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:29,200
I am the girl failure Dom of the allures gen one in Dolce and I hope you will stick around

85
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,040
I love to do wacky voices. I like to be entertaining and be a little crazy

86
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,440
Amen, Hannah, you guys can't see me, but I'm shaking my body furiously

87
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:43,280
I just had to turn down the physics so my head doesn't fly off. I realize my head doesn't quite match my body

88
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,680
What's up with that? I don't know it doesn't matter

89
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,360
I'm a little insane in the membrane insane in the brain if you will

90
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,880
but

91
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:01,280
Yeah, we'll just we'll just we're just chilling. It's because you're autistic, you know, you're probably correct. I

92
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,120
Was reading through the posts I made last night on my all about me

93
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,040
This like having like stuff with control and how I need to have things just straight

94
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,040
So like I have a type of OCD

95
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,960
Well, I have normal OCD and then I have OCP D

96
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:24,240
But I just usually just over use like OCD because people know what OCD is OCP D is is a obsessive-compulsive personality disorder

97
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,720
And it's where you like have like an obsession with control and things being perfect like you're like a

98
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:36,280
Perfectionist to the like t-inth degree and so I was reading back and I'm like

99
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,160
Wow, I sound so autistic

100
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,040
I know I'm not like I

101
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:48,960
Think I was evaluated, but like it's just funny because like I have a lot of I

102
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:54,880
Have a flaw that like it but like I don't I don't like to say I'm something or like I am like

103
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:02,720
Because I don't want it to make it a person part like part of my personality like I'm some quirky manic pixie dream girl

104
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,800
It's just more like I'm being transparent and like this is my thought process guys is what I'm thinking about

105
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:12,560
It's usually due to these things. Let me tell you about it. And that's kind of why I bring stuff up

106
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:19,160
But yeah, it's okay. I'll do it for you. Nori is autistic in the best way. Not that there's a bad way, but

107
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,960
She's she's great. It's it's actually to be honest with you

108
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:31,720
You'd be surprised how many neurodivergent people are in the V2 being community and it's pretty like all these creative types coming together

109
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,720
It's really awesome to be honest with you

110
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,560
So yeah, it's pretty nifty I get to share share share a space with such cool people

111
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,240
You're quirky and that's okay

112
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,960
I'm literally so quirky

113
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,960
No, it's super interesting to read got me thinking about my own journey

114
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:53,320
Oh, yeah, like I always like to introduce like if people don't know so I might all yesterday

115
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,160
I talked about how like I have this like I kind of already just said it

116
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,040
But like how I had this need to control about what other people feel about me

117
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:05,120
But it's weird like as a viewer or if you like send me hay or if you're just like over like a no

118
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,520
You know a viewer. I love you to death blah blah blah blah

119
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:13,720
That's great and all but if it's like a peer of mine not that like not and I not one of my gen mates mind you

120
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,720
I'm more of like

121
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:22,920
People in the V2 being community as a whole that are also fellow vTubers big and small if someone

122
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,160
like

123
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:33,000
Doesn't respond or doesn't do something or doesn't do so certain way that like I have already in my head put together

124
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,320
I'm just like

125
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:42,720
This isn't perfect. This isn't what I wanted and so I was just like why do I have this obsession for everything to be liked and to

126
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:48,160
Kind of have everything a certain way and then I'm like, oh wait, it's mental Illinois

127
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:55,240
But yeah, so I like to have like it's always important to have some like self-reflection and introspection and stuff

128
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:03,160
I'm so sorry for starting the stream off like this. This is not how I wanted to start stream. I'll be honest with you

129
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,040
me just talking about stuff, uh

130
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,880
I'm so I feel like really like awfully Lee

131
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,160
Like I just feel silly silly Willie like I don't even know

132
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,760
Whatever I'll probably

133
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:24,880
Cut that out of the vaude because it's I'm very self-conscious about what comes out of my mouth

134
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:29,640
Although stuff is on the internet forever, so um, I

135
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,960
Just feel like it ruins like

136
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,800
Like I feel like it ruins the mood

137
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,800
Like I like we're here to have a date. We're here to like do stuff. We're here to congratulate

138
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:47,680
Is there for her birthday? We're here to I don't want to talk about that stuff. Oh, thank you

139
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:51,840
So for me for the 20 gifted, please say thank you if you got a gifted

140
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:59,360

141
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:06,400

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:41,320
Why is it casting hold on why is it casting my web page? What is

160
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,080

Mind that my window is being streamed, and I'm just like is it is it being streamed

00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,200
What's going on here

164
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:09,620
I'm just gonna I'm just gonna close it so I don't accidentally do something stupid

165
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,400
Let me look it up on my phone instead

166
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:19,320
Cuz I remember one time I did something stupid where I googled something like what's the weather today, and then I pulled up

167
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,120
Who I was it wasn't that was in my PL though. Um

00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,120
Spirit Halloween

174
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,440

What hold on what's the what's the what are people saying in the chat is it like is it is

176
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:12,080
Where's the chat is it stuck it's always stuck. I

177
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,800
Just want to make sure it's just stuck

178
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,800
It's

179
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:28,640
Tap always be be being stuck. Um, all right, let me

182
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,560
Oh

183
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:51,320
My god, why can't I make stuff smaller? It won't make me let me shrink the window. Okay, there we go

184
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,360
Yippie

185
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,800
Yeah, dream about me

186
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,200
Was it a night dream?

187
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,640
We see me can you dream with me?

188
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,320
Yeah, let me get rid of this put this on

189
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,320
I

190
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,240
Can't hear anything

191
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,480
Can hear that that's for sure

192
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:36,200
No, you filthy freaky sweet appear. I'm like your panties. I'm not wearing any huh take that

193
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,320
I mean what? Okay, there's

194
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:53,440
I'm gonna take off the white way is it fully voice-acted or is it only a little bit voice-acted hold on

195
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,880
Is sucker for love

196
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,400
A date to die for fully voice-acted

197
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,400
Okay

198
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:15,520
Okay, so I will in the take off although I know the voice acting is very this is gorgeous by the way

199
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:20,560
This little one before jump scares. There's jump scares. Is this a horror game?

200
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,160
What

201
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,360
Jack over the desk and sniff

202
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,200
Why did I just get disconnected from my wife?

203
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,560
Oh, I'm gonna keep I'm gonna do the voices

204
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,520
Hey, look, it's I

205
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,000
I forgot the protagonist is tan. That's pretty cool

206
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Whoa

207
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:52,720
I don't know if I'm gonna like play this to like all the endings are completion

208
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,600
At least in one episode. I love the art style

209
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,400
very very nineties

210
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,840
Oh

211
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,720
Chapter one the thousand versus the one

212
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,080
Wait, hold on I need to put on my

213
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,480
Eldritch gods

214
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,160
cosmos

215
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:26,720
Things beyond I understand him to merely gaze upon their forms to abandon all hope

216
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:35,280
They are sequestered to the stars appearing only through challenging failure prone rituals and in honorable incantations

217
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,240
May turn the music down

218
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,760
That's some intense music

219
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:53,200
They're twisted fanatical followers require no such invitation to commit horrors beyond belief in this stand

220
00:24:53,760 --> 00:25:00,240
It is then when the boogeyman lurking in the shadows is an obscure and perceptible shade

221
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,040
but a tangible madman

222
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:10,480
That the vague prognostications of the stars become empty threats before the an undeniable material

223
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,040
A simple hatchet in their hands

224
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,360
Did

225
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,120
Something scary happen

226
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,320
Huh, huh

227
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,200
Oh wait, hold on I should give her a different voice in the book you're reading. Did something scary happen?

228
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,680
You're as pale as a sheet

229
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,120
Oh, just a strange dream

230
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,560
I'm all right

231
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,400
Oh

232
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,240
Sorry, this might sound strange, but can you tell me where I am?

233
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,680
You're in my bookstore in the Sacramento. Are you lost?

234
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:59,360
Oh, no, I think I know where I am now. Thanks

235
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,320
Bleeding hearts are a lot more hardcore than I thought

236
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,160
I've been having odd dreams lately waking in strange places. No memory on how they got there

237
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,320
Started around the same I keep stumbling over some of my words. I apologize

238
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,840
Started around the same time folks began vanishing from my hometown

239
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,160
Sacramento not Sacramento. Sacramento

240
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:29,360
Despite the small size of this backwater town dozens have gone missing this past year

241
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,880
So many that the trains won't even stop here now

242
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,600
I should probably change the voice because this is my mommy voice. I'm gonna give that to the goat lady. So I'll

243
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,760
Worried locals say they've spotted angry spirits probably

244
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,200
No, I can't

245
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,120
Worried locals say they've spotted angry spirits prowling the woods

246
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:08,640
Animals with too many features watching outsiders can't shake the feeling of being watched by the townsfolk unblinking purple eyes

247
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,280
The Sacramento stair they call it

248
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,920
Um, have you made a selection? Did you find a book to your liking?

249
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:23,760
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry. Didn't mean to keep you here late on my account

250
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,640
No, no, it's fine. I'm glad that you enjoyed reading my books

251
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:34,000
But it's starting to get dark outside with all the disappearances lately. You better hurry home

252
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,680
Um, my family fled this place long ago when the disappearances started

253
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,000
But a letter imploring me to come visit appeared in my apartment earlier this week

254
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:50,720
Hey stardust mom's still pretty shaken up about everything. So I'm taking care of her at grand's place

255
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:56,560
If you come by for a visit, I know it's here right up and help her feel better. We miss you like crazy

256
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,680
This is definitely my father's handwriting and only my parents call me stardust

257
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,400
Impossible

258
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:09,200
Mom dad, I know you're not really waiting for me. You've been gone for over a year

259
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:14,880
But whoever sent this note obviously wants me to come poking around and I aim to find out why

260
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,920
Spooky

261
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,720
Can be roman stoned instead

262
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,200
um

263
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,700
So her parents have already passed away

264
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:34,980
And somebody's luring her with how they're that spoopy

265
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:41,780
There's something strange in sacramento the dreams the stare the spirits

266
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,340
It's all connected. I'm sure of it

267
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:48,260
Whatever darkness has settled in our neck of the woods. I'm putting a stop to it

268
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:50,900
mom

269
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,260
dad

270
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,260
I love you both so much

271
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:56,260
I'll get to the bottom of this

272
00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:02,180
Thanks for letting me doze off. I promise I'll come back real soon

273
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:06,980
Thank you for stopping in take care

274
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:13,220
A warm glow of the bookstore fades by sorry

275
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,220
There's a mystery foot

276
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:23,140
The warm glow of the bookstore fades behind me as I step out into the dusk

277
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:28,180
Sacramento this should be my hometown, but it's become

278
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,620
Unrecognizable

279
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:37,540
House sound by the way sound is sound good. Is it is everything good?

280
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,620
Well gang

281
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,820
Okay, cool

282
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:53,460
The streets are overrun with the dense foliage and missing person posters that litter every surface

283
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,740
They call this the missing person lane now

284
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,860
desperate

285
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:04,580
Wow really creative name desperate searchers put up posters here before vanishing themselves

286
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,780
It's the only path left and it leads straight to my gram's house

287
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:14,980
But something feels off the familiar landmarks of my childhood are nowhere to be found

288
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,940
How they got unturned around

289
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:22,980
No, I've walked in a straight line yet. Nothing looks right

290
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:27,460
Oh, I accidentally skipped. I think my mouse is broken and it's double clicking

291
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:32,820
May maybe if I check the note for my parents for the address

292
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:42,820
A grocery receipt impossible. I just had their letter. I even kept my pockets empty so I wouldn't lose it

293
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,820
Wait

294
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:49,460
This receipt has the exact dimensions and folds as the letter

295
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,420
Could I have

296
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:55,220
Imagined the whole letter

297
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,460
Oh

298
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,060
Yeah

299
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,100
Spooky

300
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,140
No

301
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:12,500
Impossible I checked the back and then double check the front, but the receipt means just that

302
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:18,420
Something is very wrong. I have to get out have to run have to

303
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:24,660
Hey, ow. Are you like blind or something? Watch where you're going. Katsurama

304
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,860
I slammed right into somebody coming the other way

305
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,580
Oh, I'm sorry. Are you all right? I should have been more careful

306
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:39,140
Whoa, she's really pretty, but what on earth is this girl doing wandering around Sacramento at night?

307
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,140
I

308
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,380
The purple green is a great aesthetic

309
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,580
Don't touch me

310
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:54,020
Sorry, I didn't mean to smack into you like that. I know it's not an excuse, but I was just in a rush

311
00:31:55,060 --> 00:32:01,460
Oh, yeah, I know you gotta go run off and steal my boyfriend, right? Yeah, it's whatever totally cool

312
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,780
Save your breath. I already know how this goes

313
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,260
Wait, huh?

314
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,460
What

315
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,460
Your boyfriend?

316
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:14,100
Yeah, you heard me my boyfriend buck is mine

317
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:18,900
Who the heck is buck? Where are all these accusations coming from?

318
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:23,860
I don't know anyone named buck

319
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:30,180
Huh really you don't know who buck is

320
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:35,860
You're not like from out of town. Are you?

321
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:44,500
The stair it's real. I turned my head down a briskly walk faster. She starts walking alongside me

322
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,860
Male mention what the buck

323
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:53,540
Hey, look at me

324
00:32:54,180 --> 00:33:00,420
I can't let her see my eyes no matter what she'll notice. I don't have the Sacramento stair. What the heck is that?

325
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,620
You can tell me are you from here or what?

326
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,420
I live here

327
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:17,220
Oh, yeah, look at me really quick. Sorry. I forgot to turn the oh, yeah, look at me really quick

328
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:23,620
This is bad even if I make it home. She'll know where I live. What do I do?

329
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,220
Look at me

330
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:34,660
I freeze before I know it. I'm already staring straight at her

331
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:40,340
Hmm

332
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:47,860
Bucky, hi got another one Priya. I'm missing person Lane

333
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:52,580
I break into a mad dash running my heart is everything is a blur

334
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:58,500
My heart pounding in my ears can't tell what the sounds of whistle shouts an undefiled commotion coming from all sides

335
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,380
Panting and dizzy

336
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:07,060
I feel my body slowing down, but the image of my face on the next missing persons poster kicks my leg into action one more

337
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:13,060
There a clearing up ahead if I can break their line of sight. I might find a chance to hide

338
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,140
As I near the turnoff my exhaustion makes itself known

339
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,940
If this is a dead end

340
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,940
Or it's too dark to find my way

341
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,540
I won't have the energy to turn around and start running again

342
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:38,100
Rounding the corner I gasp it's Grema's house. Thank goodness. I dash up the path and burst through the door

343
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:49,460
I hold the door shut for what feels like forever as my pulse grows

344
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:52,980
The pounding footsteps pass by outside

345
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,860
I'm safe for now

346
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,020
Hey, what's

347
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:07,380
I may just be standing at the entrance, but I can already tell something feels off about my home

348
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:11,140
Like the warm familiar place I grew up in is long gone

349
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:14,180
I can't put my finger on it, but

350
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,140
This dread

351
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:19,460
Why do I feel like I need to sneak around my own home?

352
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,660
Is someone here?

353
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,300
Hello

354
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:28,580
Dies first in a horror movie. Is anyone there?

355
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,100
No response

356
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,700
Oh

357
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,060
What

358
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,420
butterfly

359
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:45,140
A butterfly caught in a web strange. I don't see a spider around wonder how long the poor thing's been trapped. Can I can I have it?

360
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,620
Oh

361
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:58,180
Yep, my mouse is definitely going at least like towards the corner of it, but if I go up higher, it's fine. Okay, so I look it's me

362
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,980
Is there a timer? I don't think no, there's no timer

363
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,140
There's only a close button over here

364
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:16,100
So it looks like we got like the kitchen dining room just like area living room upstairs

365
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:22,420
Love and then all the bedrooms and then a bathroom and a shower

366
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,940
Meetings, okay

367
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:30,500
I'm not gonna know any way around by the way

368
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,420
I hate this

369
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:37,060
I forgot this is kind of a horror game

370
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:42,740
Please am I gonna have to buy a new mouse? Oh, I have to pull and drag

371
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,980
Where am I?

372
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,460
Okay

373
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,940

374
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,220

What's over there, huh? Our family photos look off

377
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:08,900
None of them have me in it and my siblings their faces seem unfamiliar

378
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:13,780
What are those weird symbols doing over there? Are you gonna talk about the giant bucket of paint like I

379
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:17,540
There's a bucket of paint

380
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:26,100
Boomi you need to get out the way. Oh, I thought that was a person. It's just a pig. Excuse me boomi. Can you get down?

381
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,340
Thank you

382
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:33,220

Mean I mean, yeah welcome to red ketchup

Looks like the triplets toys have been mostly untouched ever since we left in a hurry. What went on here

385
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,500
What's going on?

386
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:53,220
What's happening? Oh, I I'll go back. Yep. My mouse is messed up. Um

I don't like this bro. What uh, am I gonna talk about the purple paint everywhere?

394
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,700
Wait, what the hell? Oh, okay. Where am I?

395
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:50,740
Okay, I'll go upstairs

396
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,620
All right

397
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:02,740
All right, wow very beautiful

398
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:09,380
Beautiful artwork. Am I not gonna say anything about that? All right, it's a bathroom. I don't really need to go there

399
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:12,580
I'm scared to look in the bathroom

400
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,580
I

401
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,740
Messy painters

402
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:24,740
Hello, is that my bedroom? There's this my bedroom. Wait, why don't I just look at the map?

403
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,260
Wait, do I have to keep going down the hallway?

404
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,420
But there's no

405
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:44,180
Is it my dumb probably oh my mouse is freaking out

406
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,740
Okay purple

407
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:58,180
This is my bed what this can't be my bedroom

408
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:02,980
Some creep plaster in my little brother's room with smutty posters

409
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,700
Whoever did this is gonna get a fist in their face

410
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:11,700
Uh, I don't think this is your house my dear a pale flower. It's beautiful beyond belief

411
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,540
Okay

412
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:20,740
Nifty there's so many so many beds in one single room though

413
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,780
Some creep

414
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,900
Okay, I guess it's

415
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:35,140
What the heck this is very disorder. Oh, okay

416
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:42,180
Oh beautiful just how I left it

417
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:50,100
My room what on earth happened here this occult nonsense has someone been living in my house

418
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:56,740
The candles are still lit whoever's responsible was just here, but who why?

419
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:07,220
Oh, I'm like why is the game freeze this because it mine either no title no author and it reeks of death and decay

420
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,820
With trembling fingers. I opened it to a random page

421
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,900
Why is the game lagging so hard when I click

422
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:25,460
See the black woods instructions on how to corrupt the soil of a forest by using remains of a goat in the beating heart of a human

423
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:28,420
The beating what?

424
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:34,500
I've read and reread the passage, but it's plain as black and white the beating heart of a human

425
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:39,140
I read again and again my disbelief washing away more and more each time

426
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,140
this

427
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:43,140
isn't a joke

428
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:45,140
bleeding

429
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:48,660
A bleeding heart

430
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:54,100
First the stare that only the locals have then the

431
00:41:54,980 --> 00:42:00,900
Disappearances then the supernaturally overgrown woods and now this the truth dawns on me smiley face

432
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:05,380
Sacramento has been overrun by cultists

433
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:11,140
All those missing people my parents they haven't been spirited away by angry forest spirits

434
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:15,700
They've been abducted and I'm next wait. I thought my parents were oh, they were

435
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:22,340
Dead, okay, awkward. There must be a way to stop this. I flipped desperately through the books pulsating pages

436
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:25,700
How does that happen searching for anything that might help?

437
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:34,260
Summon the all mother a ritual to force the dark deity behind this madness to physically manifest before me

438
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:37,220
Binding her in a form that can't directly harm me

439
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:40,980
This is it

440
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:45,220
My chance to end this nightmare once and for all to face a sinister goddess behind

441
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:47,780
Sacramento's madness and put a stop to her evil

442
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:52,740
Whatever the cost for the sake of everyone who suffered and died. I have to try

443
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:58,660
I'll bind this all mother to a physical form and destroy her looks like I already have everything I need to try

444
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:02,260
All right, what do I need?

445
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:05,860
Rocks on selva oscura

446
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,500
Ooh, she's pretty hot already

447
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:12,260
This ritual will bind the black goat to a physical form that can't harm you

448
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:18,020
However, no contact with eldritch gods is completely safe to summon her do any of the following dowsony lit candles

449
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:22,100
Ensure there is an idol the black goat present somewhere in the room have a plant

450
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:27,620
Mr. With you while facing a tree of the blackwoods chant her name. Okay

451
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,500
um, well, that's

452
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,380
The idol of a goat

453
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:35,700
Um

454
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,580
I'm gonna grab the plant mister

455
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:42,420
I can spray the speaker with water

456
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:45,380
What?

457
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,540
How does that work?

458
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:56,020
I don't know how that happened

459
00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:01,780
This feature is primarily including consideration of players you just like being hit on by older women elder tribominations

460
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:03,780
But it has other uses too

461
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:05,860
what

462
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:11,140
Wait, so like if somebody why would they play the game if they don't want to be hit on by an eldritch being

463
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:15,300
That doesn't make any sense. Okay. Well, I'm gonna

464
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:18,900
Douse these candles

465
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:21,300
Have a plant mister

466
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:24,260
Got that i'm facing tree of the blackwoods

467
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:29,540
Azura do lay azura do lay azura do lay

468
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,500
Hit him

469
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:39,780
Mortal you dare summon me again

470
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:48,820
Have your pathetic lives not been extended long enough by my gift. Have you lost not been sated must you continue to torment your goddess? So

471
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:53,700
My heart pounds as an immense towering figure

472
00:44:54,260 --> 00:45:01,300
Mysterializes before me my head is splitting open. I can't think I can barely breathe with this weight crushing down on me

473
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:05,300
Well, it's not as I can't do Azura's voice. So I'm just gonna you know

474
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:19,540
Do you have any idea who I am I am Roxanne the black goat of the woods and you will row this day

475
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:25,380
Madness given form shredding my insanity with each second that it passes

476
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:27,620
It's evil

477
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:29,620
Ancient and endless

478
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:32,820
Peering into the deepest parts of me that it was never meant to be seen

479
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:38,900
You tread on dangerous ground little lamb know that each time you summon me

480
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:41,620
My wrath grows

481
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:46,500
I will make you rear each second of agony you have inflicted

482
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:49,060
Now choose your next words carefully

483
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:52,580
What more could you possibly want of me?

484
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:55,300
Speak

485
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:59,700
I have to banish her to send her back before there's nothing left of me

486
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:04,100
But the words I need won't come did I really think I could face a power like this?

487
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:06,900
Stupid stupid girl

488
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:12,180
With the last shreds of my will I cling to the thought of why I came why I dared this folly

489
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:17,940
I swallow bile and terror straighten my spine grab a candle from the floor and speak shakily

490
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:26,420
I'm here to stop you from hurting another soul. I'm sending you back to the darkness you crawled out of one way or another

491
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:29,940
Really

492
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:35,940
Um, yeah

493
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:40,740
Oh, thank goodness. I thought this nightmare would never end

494
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:47,300
Um, aren't you supposed to be like trying to stop me or something?

495
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,580
No, I'm into this get me out of here

496
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:56,740
My brow fur is as I stare at her orlessly. Isn't she supposed to want to you know

497
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:59,380
spread madness and whatnot

498
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:01,460
damn she is

499
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:02,660
Oh

500
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:08,420
Can we just look at her? She looks really tired though, but I'm kind of digging the eye bags in the mole. Oh my god

501
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:09,780
We're twinning

502
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:11,780
And oh look at those

503
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:15,380
Hungers she looks really comfy. I really like this like

504
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:17,780
first shawl

505
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:19,380
thing going on

506
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:25,300
In the giant like fluffy pool. I feel like mercy should get a hairstyle like this where it's all up and crazy like that

507
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:27,380
That'd be so cool

508
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:30,180
Are we furries now?

509
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:34,340
Fuck

510
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:48,900
Yeah, those eye bags those are Louis Vuitton bags you're confused

511
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:55,700
Well, yeah, you want to be exercised

512
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:01,620
Banished yes, I'm rooted to your planets. You can wait now. I actually like the

513
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:04,820
Other deep voice that I had not with the British accent

514
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:10,100
Yes, I'm rooted to your planets and cannot be removed without a human's aid

515
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:15,940
I don't understand you have so many followers

516
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:20,580
Followers that just tried to kill me. I might add

517
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:23,220
Can't they free you instead?

518
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:28,580
Things have gotten messy with my cultists

519
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:31,220
messy in a bad way

520
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:32,740
I mean

521
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:39,060
My followers have turned against me and are abusing me in my woods power to kill outsiders indiscriminately

522
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:46,180
Have pity on this old tired goat and banish me so I can't trouble humanity any longer

523
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:49,060
Please

524
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:51,060
Help me

525
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:56,900
I wrote my temple. This is tricky on one hand. I came here to banish her

526
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:02,900
This crop de forest is devouring this town who knows how much farther all spread if nothing is done

527
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:07,940
I'm gonna move you guys over here so I can see the chat a little bit better

528
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:09,940
Oh

529
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:20,580
I don't blame her if I live for thousands of years of exhaustive

530
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:24,820
Well, it's not that like it's more so that she's like tired of like being linked to earth

531
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:28,500
I think she's like I kind of wanted to go back to what I was doing man, you know

532
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:36,020
On the other hand, I have serious reservations about helping an eldritch to god to anything

533
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:42,900
All of those missing persons posters. She's responsible. She and her cult are pure evil

534
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:45,620
But for now we want the same thing

535
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:48,660
Her gone

536
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:55,380
All right, tell me how to do this do I just grab any old knife and

537
00:49:56,420 --> 00:50:02,820
Your mortal weapons can harm me can harm me. No can harm me child

538
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:05,380
But they cannot stop me

539
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:09,540
But that book you carry it holds the key to my banishment

540
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:13,940
Perform the rituals in order until you arrive at the uprooting ritual

541
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:16,580
That one will banish me for good

542
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:19,860
First things first you will need a partner

543
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:26,740
I am a goddess of lust so many of your rituals will require you to be in the presence of your ideal mate

544
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:29,220
Your heart's desire

545
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:31,780
Perform the spawn partner ritual on the next page

546
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:35,380
Oh

547
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:43,620
Spawn partner

548
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:48,180
Light the ritual candles the color of flame does not matter. So please you a color you find comforting

549
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:53,140
Have your choice of an aromantic herb herb on your person pick a scent you find pleasant

550
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:57,540
Imagine your ideal partner if it exists and it'll appear free before you in a cloud of smoke

551
00:50:57,620 --> 00:50:59,620
If it does not exist it will be created

552
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:04,660
Do not imagine something you can't put back chant blablabla blablabla blablabla, okay

553
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:08,580
Uh, let's let's light some candles

554
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:15,940
Oh the blue is kind of a moon yellow

555
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:21,780
Oh

556
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:28,020
The green's kind of cool too. Where's the red? There we go. We'll do it red match me

557
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:35,940
My two partners on the bottom right of the screen rosemary lavender or mint. Um

558
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:41,060
Lavender is my mom's favorite. So maybe I shouldn't pick that. I like mint

559
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,020
Rosemary just

560
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:46,020
Just smells like food to me. So I'm gonna do mint

561
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:49,460
Um, I was gonna do rosemary because it has like

562
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:54,900
Comforting stuff to me, but then I don't want to spawn my mom. Although I guess this lady is kind of like my mommy

563
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:58,180
Some of the mojito. I think you know, I think I might

564
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:01,860
All right, and imagining my ideal a partner

565
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:07,940
harem harem harem harem

566
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:13,700
Oh

567
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:33,380
Oh my oh wait, I can't explain

568
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:38,340
Go ahead

569
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:41,860
Harem you look different

570
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:52,900
Uh, I've got nothing what is wrong with my taste

571
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:55,140
That

572
00:52:57,940 --> 00:53:02,820
There's no need to be bashful, especially after all that time you spent playing coy

573
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:09,380
In view of the circumstances, perhaps I will allow you to be my partner

574
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:15,380
Really and that's okay with you even though we just met

575
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:18,980
Well, am I ideal partner is Azura?

576
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:22,340
For responding. No

577
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:28,660
No, your honor. This is no matter what I picked. This is what I've what have happened

578
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:37,300
I feel like Azura should play this game. That'd be pretty awesome

579
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:44,340
Well, it's sudden and it'll be a long long time before I can ever trust a human

580
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:49,220
Again, but I'm not exactly the god of

581
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:52,100
Taking things slow

582
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:59,780
Besides I already have a thousand children. There's no harm in a thousand and one

583
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:02,980
Wait, what are we talking about?

584
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:06,980
What

585
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:10,980
What are we talking?

586
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:14,020
Huh

587
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:16,740
Emi

588
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:20,740
Taking me as your partner

589
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:28,260
I thought you were just talking about being my girlfriend

590
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:38,180
You drink water

591
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:40,420
You

592
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:49,300
Thought you thought the two definitions of partners that a fertility goddess was referring to the platonic meaning

593
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:53,240
There's three meanings of partners

594
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:58,900
What's the third cowboys

595
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:08,020
Cowboys

596
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:10,180
Uh

597
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:25,220
Oh, are you still joking around while standing so close to me you should be melting with desire

598
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:31,460
Being anywhere within a mile of me should amplify or lost a thousand fold. I like how our little eye comes out

599
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:35,460
Oh, that's what it is. It's just a little it's another eye. It's on an eye bag

600
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:39,140
It's kind of cool. It's a neat little thingy

601
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:44,180
Oh, that's an easy one a thousand times zero is zero

602
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:51,780
Wait, are you saying what I think you're saying? Yep

603
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:58,420
So I take it you haven't had children yet

604
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:01,460
Nope

605
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:06,020
And you you aren't with child now

606
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:09,700
No

607
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:14,020
You're going to die here and and there's nothing I can do to help

608
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:20,260
What I thought we were gonna try to get you out of here. You're just not gonna help me because I don't have kids

609
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:25,700
It's not that I won't it's that I can't

610
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:31,780
I'm in an entity of untapped cosmic potential and I want a big family

611
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:34,420
The biggest family possible

612
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:40,180
I want every living thing on earth to be a direct descendant of me or one of my followers

613
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:46,020
Those that best serve that goal receive a fraction of my power

614
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:52,980
The most devoted followers are bestowed with gifts like extended lifespans rapid healing

615
00:56:53,460 --> 00:57:00,660
Physical enhancement and in some cases immortality and those followers are the ones looking for you

616
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:08,500
You on the other hand have closed yourself off to my dark influence and are mortal and vulnerable

617
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:11,220
No kids no powers

618
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:20,020
What if I don't want powers or kids no badans and what hold on

619
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:29,460
And what if I drain the life from your body and then used it to fertilize my wicked soil until something

620
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:32,260
That will give me grandchildren comes crawling out

621
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:36,500
I take an involuntary step backwards

622
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:43,700
Huh, I'm sorry you didn't deserve that. Are you all right?

623
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:47,300
I'm fine. Don't worry about me

624
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:49,300
I

625
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:56,740
Powers or not. Let's move on to the next ritual so you can get out of here. Okay. I know she JoJo posed on this so true

626
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:03,460
Holy moly that was freaking scary and hot

627
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:08,580
She's really taking this hard. I better go get the stuff for the next ritual

628
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:12,660
All right next ritual

629
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:19,300
We need meat from a living thing that died within the blackwoods check the meat rack in the dining room

630
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:25,380
Milk of the black gold goat store bought 2% is apparently fine too. It's in the fridge

631
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:32,500
Lastly a receptacle fill to the brim of the good life blood. They mean blood. Please use blood from now on. Sorry. Oh

632
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:34,500
Oh

633
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:42,340
Yes liquid life

634
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:48,900
I feel like this like they put this in because of the joke like they put sorry in because of the joke

635
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:53,780
Chant while always facing fire red candles. Okay, so I already

636
00:58:54,180 --> 00:59:03,060
Okay, let's make those red. Oh, oh she she looks really cute

637
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:12,340
So these followers are kind of like jealous ex-boyfriends then you want nothing to do with them, but they won't let you leave

638
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:18,100
Actually, yes, that's precisely right. They're like my exes

639
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:24,900
And using the same metaphor if you try to date me then my exes will hack you to death with farm tools

640
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:31,940
What is this scott pilgrim? I have to fight your deadly evil exes your seven deadly evil. I don't figure remember

641
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:37,140
I guess that last part wasn't a metaphor

642
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:41,700
Maybe I should get back to the rituals then

643
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:44,820
That's probably a good idea

644
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:48,820
All right, can I not talk to her again? Oh

645
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:53,540
Let's go

646
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:02,580
Slowly turn

647
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:07,060
All right, where am I? Uh

648
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:13,300
Okay, so I need to turn around yep

649
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:21,060
And then I need to use this week. Nope. I went the wrong way

650
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:26,340
This might I'm making myself freaking dizzy

651
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:31,060
What where the heck is happening? Hold on

652
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:41,620
What

653
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:44,180
Oh

654
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:55,620
Hello

655
01:00:57,060 --> 01:00:58,820
This is fun

656
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:04,180
Huh, that's odd because somebody only had one futon downstairs. Well, the extra pet come from why are they all laid out like this?

657
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:07,140
That's a great. It looks like it was a really fun

658
01:01:08,580 --> 01:01:10,580
um

659
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:16,980
Slumber party in my opinion. Uh, I'm gonna go in here and grab the bucket of blood

660
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:21,140
If I can oh nope, it's not in there. Let me just go back

661
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:27,700
Mep

662
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:30,260
Mep

663
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:33,140
I

664
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:41,380
Slumber party in the house of a god of loss that sounds pretty fun. What is this a storage room? What is that? Oh, it's mine

665
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:44,100
Uh

666
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:50,660
Yeah, be what the heck is that floating over there?

667
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:53,780
Uh

668
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:57,700
I tear a hunk of meat from the hook. This should be what I'm looking. Why is it green?

669
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:02,020
Smells kind of strange. Is this beef pork? Whatever it came from. It was huge

670
01:02:02,580 --> 01:02:05,300
You should move on before I count the number of legs hanging on hooks

671
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:08,340
Yeah, that's uh, that's a lot of legs, uh

672
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:11,780
Oh

673
01:02:11,780 --> 01:02:16,260
Okay, perfect. There we go blood. I don't even need that. Uh, what else did I need?

674
01:02:18,340 --> 01:02:20,340
Milk, okay, I needed milk

675
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:26,020
Milk

676
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:33,300
Ooh, can I get some gloves? Is there anything? Oh spices. Okay, I'll keep mine of those

677
01:02:34,820 --> 01:02:38,180
Because I probably need them. What is this bleach? Oh cooking oil

678
01:02:39,140 --> 01:02:43,380
burnt hair and sulfur. Oh lovely. Uh, let's go in the fridge

679
01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:48,020
This

680
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:54,900
This is the milk of the black coat. It just looks like regular cart carton of store-bought strawberry milk with a label slapped on it

681
01:02:55,780 --> 01:02:57,540
Missing

682
01:02:57,540 --> 01:03:02,500
I guess the cultists would have a hard time getting the real thing from Oksan now that their relationship has soured

683
01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:06,340
No pun intended. Why is it spicy?

684
01:03:08,420 --> 01:03:10,420
This should be good enough

685
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:18,820
Uh, uh, children's right up my spine. Am I being watched? I have everything I need. I get out. I need to get out of here fast

686
01:03:18,820 --> 01:03:30,660
What the heck is that? Oh, they're bodies

687
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:32,660
Uh

688
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:49,860
Wait, what am I doing? I should go this way

689
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:14,180
Yeah, sorry I have to keep double checking the map because I get turned around really easily in these things

690
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:18,500
Hello, thank you

691
01:04:20,820 --> 01:04:22,820
Wait

692
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:30,100
I'm staring at the bathroom go down the hallway turn to the side there it is

693
01:04:31,620 --> 01:04:33,620
Open the damn door

694
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:38,180
Knowing that their bodies makes it less scary

695
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:40,980
It did actually

696
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:46,100
We need a gps. It's there. It's called the map. All right got that milk of the black goat

697
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:51,060
Blood and I have the fire can't we hold me make sure they're red? Okay, they're red

698
01:04:53,940 --> 01:04:57,700
Oh, holy gory, I piss up with the buck pandanora

699
01:04:57,860 --> 01:04:59,860
Uh

700
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:02,180
Oh

701
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:06,020
Oh, well done. Looks like you did everything perfectly impressive

702
01:05:07,060 --> 01:05:09,060
Nothing to it if all the ritual

703
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:14,500
Sorry nothing to it if all the rituals are this easy. I'll have you out of here in no time

704
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:17,620
Hmm, perhaps so

705
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:26,500
Uh, I don't want to leave things as they are between us your life is your own. I'm sorry for losing my composure

706
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:33,300
Oh that I nearly forgot about that already. I'm a little surprised the literal god would bother apologizing to a human at all

707
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:36,660
Channeling strong at the end of that chant there

708
01:05:39,140 --> 01:05:44,020
I've given it some thought and while you may be blasphemingly

709
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:46,020
abstinent

710
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:48,260
You're the only person in the world that can help me

711
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:50,900
You see

712
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:57,380
If you step within range of my woods any desire you have that will lead you closer to me is amplified to such an intense degree

713
01:05:57,940 --> 01:06:00,820
That it's imbearable and most of the time it's lost

714
01:06:02,180 --> 01:06:09,620
Anyone here anyone who has led here seeking karnor animalistic pleasures develops the sacramento chair stare

715
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:12,580
The chair becomes a cultist

716
01:06:14,180 --> 01:06:16,420
If you're brought into my woods for any other reason

717
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:20,100
You don't make you don't become oh, I can't I read

718
01:06:20,820 --> 01:06:25,780
Become one of my chosen thousand and your desire will make you futilely search the woods for what isn't there

719
01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:32,820
You'll forget to eat and sleep and you'll search and search until you die of exhaustion become fertilizer for the woods to grow further

720
01:06:33,860 --> 01:06:37,060
You're the only person to reach me without joining the cult or dropping dead

721
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:41,700
Thanks and no small part to the fact that you don't have lust to amplify

722
01:06:44,660 --> 01:06:49,460
Oh, that was my my chest so my collar bones cracking

723
01:06:55,940 --> 01:07:03,940
My only question is if you're not here for lost, why are you here?

724
01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:12,980
I pull the receipt out of my pocket chicken curry fried chicken cheese boiga beer water ketchup soy sauce other

725
01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:15,140
This is more what's in my fruit than what's in my fridge right now

726
01:07:17,220 --> 01:07:19,140
I came looking for my parents

727
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:21,060
They vanished somewhere around here a year ago

728
01:07:21,220 --> 01:07:23,860
This used to be a letter from them saying they were here in this house

729
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:27,540
But once I got here it turned into a blank receipt and what turned back

730
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:33,300
Excuse me

731
01:07:34,340 --> 01:07:40,340
The woods have indeed toyed with your emotions to bring you here the paper is never likely never a letter from your parents

732
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:42,740
But the woods made you believe it was I'm sorry

733
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:46,740
So they're just

734
01:07:46,820 --> 01:07:48,820
still gone

735
01:07:49,540 --> 01:07:53,940
They were likely consumed by my woods no more than three days after they disappeared

736
01:07:56,180 --> 01:08:03,380
I feel like I've been punched in the gut the dust has long settled on my parents being gone, but the grief never faded

737
01:08:06,260 --> 01:08:11,140
Eat I'll give it your strength back the woods won't let you feel how tired you are

738
01:08:13,060 --> 01:08:15,380
I don't feel tired at all but come to think of it

739
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:18,500
I felt like I was gonna collapse when I made it to this house

740
01:08:18,980 --> 01:08:21,140
I don't think I've eaten since I got the letter either

741
01:08:21,940 --> 01:08:23,620
I take a few bites

742
01:08:23,620 --> 01:08:25,620
and the tears abate

743
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:29,220
There there it'll be all right star dust

744
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:34,900
Star dust how did you know my parents my parents nickname for me?

745
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:40,980
Anything that dies within my black woods becomes a part of it a part of me

746
01:08:41,780 --> 01:08:47,060
Their memories of you likely live on in me wait does that mean she's dating her mom slash dad

747
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:50,020
Slash a lot of a bunch of other

748
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:52,900
dead people

749
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:55,220
It is kind of horrific

750
01:08:56,340 --> 01:09:00,900
I guess that settles it my parents really are gone. That's the only way she could know that name

751
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:03,860
This isn't the kind of closure I was hoping to find here

752
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:07,540
But it came here to put an end to the disappearances and that well that's what I'll do

753
01:09:08,260 --> 01:09:11,060
Wincest furry and wincest

754
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:16,900
I really like how it's like tv like we're watching a movie and it's like you can see the effects

755
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:19,620
on the screen

756
01:09:20,420 --> 01:09:23,220
Um, I hope this isn't an offensive question

757
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:28,180
But all the missing people and the people that came looking for them

758
01:09:29,140 --> 01:09:30,660
You

759
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:32,660
killed them all

760
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:34,900
It was never supposed to be like this

761
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:38,980
I came bearing gifts of safe childbirth for infant and mother

762
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:41,860
Hunkerlessness disease immunity

763
01:09:42,580 --> 01:09:46,420
But instead my own worshipers tormented me until it broke my hearts

764
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:51,300
Now my woods are blood thirsty and I'm forced to watch a numerable die

765
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:58,660
But why how could someone do something like that? How could somebody have so much hate in their hearts?

766
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:02,740
Because it's had an eternity to accumulate

767
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:09,300
What was that it sound like something breaking downstairs it was my heart because this is sad

768
01:10:12,820 --> 01:10:14,820
Yeah, definitely a crt vibe

769
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:20,660
It did have vhs tapes. I remembered that because I was pointing out the little filter

770
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:29,620
Are they coming already no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I forgot

771
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:34,900
Roxanne is just as scared as I am I need to be more careful with showing fear for her sake

772
01:10:36,260 --> 01:10:40,660
It could just be the house the place is old and rotten in some places

773
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:43,220
So sometimes the house shifts on its own

774
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:49,540
I take a quick look around my room for the sturdiest thing I can find they left my bass guitar untouched

775
01:10:50,260 --> 01:10:52,740
I'll check it out. It's something like it came from the kitchen

776
01:10:58,820 --> 01:11:01,060
This is bad because this lags every time I do this

777
01:11:06,580 --> 01:11:11,300
Okay, well it's gonna take me a century to get downstairs

778
01:11:15,860 --> 01:11:18,660
I know this way I follow the green light and turn around

779
01:11:19,540 --> 01:11:21,540
Oh, I didn't mean to turn around that much

780
01:11:21,940 --> 01:11:26,340
Maybe I feel like I should make the window screen a little bit bigger. It's kind of small. That's fine

781
01:11:33,860 --> 01:11:38,820
Please please there's a glitch what's happening here

782
01:11:38,820 --> 01:11:40,820
I

783
01:11:48,820 --> 01:11:50,820
The heck am I

784
01:11:52,580 --> 01:11:54,740
I have to go all over there dude. I hate this

785
01:11:57,220 --> 01:11:59,220
I didn't mean to go this way

786
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:04,820
My mouse is fucking

787
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:20,180
It's really like follow the green light and that shows the way just kidding. That's a lie. Wait

788
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:28,500
Yeah

789
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:32,820
It is a little bit confusing. I kind of wish it was different

790
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:38,740
If I was smart, I would memorize stuff, but that's not who I am. What?

791
01:12:40,180 --> 01:12:43,140
What I went I went the wrong way. I thought it was

792
01:12:45,940 --> 01:12:50,180
Sorry, I'm check I'm clearing every room to make sure you know

793
01:12:53,140 --> 01:12:57,300
That's the dining room. Okay, it's through the kitchen

794
01:12:57,860 --> 01:13:05,700
There's the meat I feel like there's more bodies. Can I please turn?

795
01:13:08,660 --> 01:13:14,420
Doesn't it look like I just came from the kitchen though. It's so weird POV mom said clean the house

796
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:22,340
Nobody's here. I don't see anything out of the ordinary. I could have just been the house settling like I said

797
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:24,900
Oh

798
01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:27,620
My god

799
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:30,500
Oh

800
01:13:33,380 --> 01:13:35,380
I forgot how to

801
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:46,420
I forgot how to freaking hit her with a bass guitar and I just fucking freaked out

802
01:13:47,140 --> 01:13:53,540
I didn't kill someone I just bonked her. She's fine. Her eyes are closed in a cute way

803
01:13:55,860 --> 01:13:57,860
I think that hit knock them out cold

804
01:13:58,580 --> 01:14:04,020
That made so much noise. I can't afford to stick around but I don't feel good about letting this maniac wake up and ambush me again

805
01:14:04,420 --> 01:14:06,660
I'll tie them up somewhere. I could keep my eye on them

806
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:09,300
Why is that knife covered in blood?

807
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:12,900
What I can't for the life of me find a wound anywhere on my body

808
01:14:13,460 --> 01:14:15,860
And I certainly don't feel any pain anywhere either. What?

809
01:14:17,380 --> 01:14:21,140
I grab a hole of the scruff of the cultist's collar and drag them in a short distance

810
01:14:21,140 --> 01:14:24,340
They feel unusually light to carry but my left arm can't produce any force

811
01:14:26,980 --> 01:14:28,980
What's going on with

812
01:14:38,180 --> 01:14:42,340
I guess the curse removes pain and all that stuff wow

813
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:47,860
What was that that vision no matter how much I focus I can't bring it back

814
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:50,420
Just like the fake letter I received

815
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:55,940
Are the woods concealing my injuries from me? So I can't tell when I'm about to drop dead

816
01:14:56,740 --> 01:15:01,140
I sling my base over my shoulder by its strap and drag the cultist with my right arm alone

817
01:15:01,860 --> 01:15:04,420
I'm sure this would be torture if I could feel pain or exhaustion

818
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:10,020
I have to go back upstairs. Oh

819
01:15:13,620 --> 01:15:15,620
I hate this

820
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:23,620
Where the frick am I hello?

821
01:15:25,940 --> 01:15:27,940
Oh my god

822
01:15:29,460 --> 01:15:31,460
Sorry, I'm taking the long way

823
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:37,300
Making sure everything's good as one does. I know I wish I could fast travel

824
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:40,900
Is that a setting because I I I feel like that's kind of annoying

825
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:43,700
Uh

826
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:47,460
It is not oh she looks nice on the splash screen damn

827
01:15:49,940 --> 01:15:51,940
I almost click clothes clothes game

828
01:16:07,220 --> 01:16:09,220
Oh wait, hold on I went too far

829
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:21,700
Hey, Roxanne, do you want to oh I like how her name is to start us now. Do you want to eat her or something?

830
01:16:22,340 --> 01:16:23,860
I'm back

831
01:16:23,860 --> 01:16:25,860
Welcome bet. What is that?

832
01:16:26,180 --> 01:16:27,460
bass guitar

833
01:16:27,460 --> 01:16:30,660
Not that the dead body. I like her

834
01:16:31,460 --> 01:16:35,540
I like her like surprised expect. Yeah jumps here got me good too. That's why

835
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:40,980
I like I wasn't anticipating it because I know the jump scares in the game because it literally says like

836
01:16:41,540 --> 01:16:45,140
There's a setting called like worn before jump scares. So

837
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:48,900
She's ziggie stardust

838
01:16:49,860 --> 01:16:51,860
Oh, they're alive actually

839
01:16:52,260 --> 01:16:59,460
You took one of the thousand alive. Sorry. You took one of the thousand alive and then brought them here

840
01:17:00,740 --> 01:17:02,340
this is

841
01:17:02,340 --> 01:17:04,180
Very good. Actually

842
01:17:04,180 --> 01:17:06,180
Now you have a blood sacrifice if we need one

843
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:09,060
What did you say?

844
01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:13,780
Some of these rituals require blood or human participants

845
01:17:14,260 --> 01:17:18,900
Having someone knocked out and served you on a silver platter makes things much easier

846
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:24,180
I didn't drag them up the stairs so they could be a sacrifice

847
01:17:26,580 --> 01:17:29,620
I tie their wrists together behind a load bearing post in my room

848
01:17:29,940 --> 01:17:38,020
Now I'm an honor god. So my moral code is completely different from that of humans, but didn't they just try to kill you?

849
01:17:39,620 --> 01:17:43,860
Maybe but under that mask this could be someone else who went missing

850
01:17:45,220 --> 01:17:47,220
a yoink

851
01:17:47,940 --> 01:17:51,220
The mask is snug against the cultist's face but we're gonna firm yank

852
01:17:53,060 --> 01:17:55,060
her

853
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:57,860
Nani oh her name is Nani

854
01:18:00,020 --> 01:18:02,340
That that had to be a bit they literally did that

855
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:06,260
Nani desuka about her last name is desuka

856
01:18:09,860 --> 01:18:11,860
I can't believe we did that

857
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:21,540
Uh-huh you you're that klutz from the missing person lane

858
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:27,620
You're worth a slam. We'll kill you. You'll never escape from this town alive

859
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:31,620
You're gonna oh so if somebody's uncomfortable with this I could like spray them

860
01:18:34,260 --> 01:18:36,260
I did it

861
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:43,780
She's maybe I bonked you on the head a little too hard

862
01:18:47,460 --> 01:18:49,860
That's a funny face. I just wanted to see what would happen

863
01:18:50,820 --> 01:18:52,820
It's not that

864
01:18:53,220 --> 01:18:59,540
She has this I bet like she would like be looking normal or like be like saying bad stuff right now

865
01:19:00,180 --> 01:19:08,260
She has the stare her lust for the leader of the thousand buck has been amplified a thousand fold into blind fanaticism

866
01:19:12,260 --> 01:19:18,100
Hey, don't try to wiggle out of that. I don't want to have to hurt you. I just need to make sure you couldn't attack me again

867
01:19:19,860 --> 01:19:25,060
You think you can steal my book bash me over the head with a guitar time me up and get away with it

868
01:19:25,700 --> 01:19:27,700
You're so dead

869
01:19:29,780 --> 01:19:33,300
What did you expect a thank you she's long gone

870
01:19:34,420 --> 01:19:38,260
It's pointless trying to talk to her if you're insisting on keeping her alive

871
01:19:38,420 --> 01:19:40,580
Just do us a both a favor and keep an eye on her

872
01:19:41,460 --> 01:19:44,900
If you have to look away don't turn your back on her for too long

873
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:46,820
I

874
01:19:46,820 --> 01:19:52,180
Do insist on keeping her alive if she has the stare then she didn't choose this

875
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:55,380
She's just another innocent person. You got tricked into coming here

876
01:19:57,060 --> 01:20:02,660
Hey, if you just stay put for now, then I can just let you go after I'm done here. Okay

877
01:20:04,020 --> 01:20:06,020
Drop dead

878
01:20:09,140 --> 01:20:12,820
I saw her return the mask to her first things first I need to do something about my arm

879
01:20:15,380 --> 01:20:20,820
Uh, well, I guess I'm gonna stare at her while I do this. I'm like scared something's gonna happen

880
01:20:23,780 --> 01:20:27,300
Place a gold skull over your face like green fire candles

881
01:20:29,060 --> 01:20:31,060
In a mirror

882
01:20:32,980 --> 01:20:34,980
Oh, I can raise people from the dead

883
01:20:38,180 --> 01:20:40,180
All right

884
01:20:40,740 --> 01:20:42,740
I

885
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:53,300
Think that was it hold on I'm just gonna stare at it. All right face a mirror green fire. Can I take that? Thank y'all

886
01:20:56,980 --> 01:20:58,980
Where's a mirror I can't move

887
01:21:01,380 --> 01:21:03,380
Is there a mirror?

888
01:21:03,700 --> 01:21:09,860
Is there a mirror in here that I'm blind to?

889
01:21:13,060 --> 01:21:17,620
I don't think so. I think I have to go to the bathroom. There's no mirror in here

890
01:21:20,900 --> 01:21:25,060
To the left of her, what do you mean to the left of her?

891
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:34,260
Because these aren't these are not mirrors it's right there in between the closets

892
01:21:35,060 --> 01:21:37,060
Oh, this is a mirror

893
01:21:38,180 --> 01:21:40,180
No, it's not

894
01:21:40,180 --> 01:21:42,180
Is it

895
01:21:42,260 --> 01:21:44,260
I thought this was the wall

896
01:21:44,260 --> 01:21:51,300
Yippee doodah yippee dee dee my oh my fix my arm today

897
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:56,660
Okay, come on it looks like it looks like the wall

898
01:21:58,820 --> 01:22:03,380
When you when you're looking around really fast, it's the same color as the wall cat catch me

899
01:22:04,660 --> 01:22:07,380
Catch me about outside. How about that cut me some slack?

900
01:22:07,860 --> 01:22:09,220
All right, that should do it

901
01:22:09,220 --> 01:22:14,820
I expect my arm, but I still can't tell whether I'm in pain or not. I can only hope I'm still not bleeding out

902
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:17,700
That about handles my injuries

903
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:21,060
Hey, um

904
01:22:21,060 --> 01:22:22,420
What?

905
01:22:22,420 --> 01:22:27,860
Your name is Nani, right? I'm gonna give you your mask back so that you can do the ritual too

906
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:30,500
I bet that lump aches, huh?

907
01:22:32,020 --> 01:22:34,020
What the one you gave me

908
01:22:34,420 --> 01:22:40,900
I didn't mean to hurt you. I swear you came at me. I was just offending myself. Look you're hurt. Let me help patch you up

909
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:42,900
And we'll call it even deal

910
01:22:43,780 --> 01:22:45,780
Like barf me out

911
01:22:46,740 --> 01:22:49,220
Here now chant bottom of the page

912
01:22:50,580 --> 01:22:52,580
I know how to do it

913
01:22:53,540 --> 01:22:58,020
A horna gets fog like yin and gher nor of grimm's vada

914
01:22:58,820 --> 01:23:00,820
She's being simlish

915
01:23:01,060 --> 01:23:02,900
better

916
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:04,900
This is gonna come back to bite you

917
01:23:05,060 --> 01:23:08,100
Just wait until I break free then your toast for real

918
01:23:09,620 --> 01:23:15,300
Wait, but I didn't if it wasn't on me. Oh wait, maybe did I just like throw her in front of the mirror because if it's not on me

919
01:23:15,940 --> 01:23:17,700
I would have done this

920
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:19,700
Oh if the caster isn't to see oh

921
01:23:20,260 --> 01:23:22,900
Yeah, I could have just done it myself for her

922
01:23:23,460 --> 01:23:25,460
Doesn't make any sense. Uh anyways

923
01:23:26,340 --> 01:23:28,100
form rot bloom

924
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:30,100
Okay, sorry

925
01:23:30,180 --> 01:23:33,380
The ritual is required to safely pro

926
01:23:35,540 --> 01:23:37,540
I didn't get to read it

927
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:41,060
Yuck. What a gruesome looking ritual. What's wrong?

928
01:23:42,420 --> 01:23:48,580
Nothing just getting the creepy crawlies from this one. It looks like I've got to eat a bunch of stuff in order to make

929
01:23:49,620 --> 01:23:52,500
A seed made immortal by my influence

930
01:23:53,060 --> 01:23:55,060
When you die a seed will bloom

931
01:23:55,620 --> 01:23:58,740
Leaving something good in the world long after you've passed away

932
01:24:00,580 --> 01:24:02,660
That's kind of beautiful actually

933
01:24:03,780 --> 01:24:05,780
Really you think so

934
01:24:07,060 --> 01:24:08,580
Oh

935
01:24:08,580 --> 01:24:10,580
I didn't get to do that

936
01:24:11,300 --> 01:24:13,940
Well, the same could be said about having children

937
01:24:14,580 --> 01:24:20,100
They carry on your legacy after long after you die too. And if you have a bunch of children, it's like living forever

938
01:24:20,980 --> 01:24:22,980
Doesn't that sound nice too?

939
01:24:23,060 --> 01:24:25,060
Hmm

940
01:24:26,580 --> 01:24:29,540
Jeez all this grandkids talk you're just like my mom

941
01:24:31,220 --> 01:24:33,220
I can work with that

942
01:24:36,820 --> 01:24:40,180
Yo, I excuse me

943
01:24:45,860 --> 01:24:47,860
Ma'am

944
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:51,700
Ma'am

945
01:24:53,380 --> 01:24:55,380
Roxanne

946
01:24:55,380 --> 01:24:59,780
Kidding kidding. I was only 60 percent serious

947
01:25:00,980 --> 01:25:02,980
That's still more than half serious

948
01:25:03,780 --> 01:25:07,620
But then again living forever something best done through offspring

949
01:25:08,660 --> 01:25:10,660
Experiencing it yourself is

950
01:25:13,060 --> 01:25:15,060
You mean like what you did to my bucky

951
01:25:16,340 --> 01:25:18,340
He brought that upon himself

952
01:25:19,300 --> 01:25:23,380
You cursed him he was your most devout follower and you cursed him

953
01:25:24,980 --> 01:25:26,980
Wait cursed

954
01:25:27,700 --> 01:25:30,420
One of my followers the leader of the thousand

955
01:25:30,900 --> 01:25:33,300
So the kiss from me long ago became immortal

956
01:25:33,860 --> 01:25:36,500
No matter what happens he will still exist

957
01:25:37,300 --> 01:25:39,060
forever

958
01:25:39,060 --> 01:25:41,060
My god, it's bucky barns

959
01:25:42,580 --> 01:25:47,620
How is that a curse I could use immortality right about now wouldn't it be nice to live forever?

960
01:25:49,140 --> 01:25:50,420
No

961
01:25:50,420 --> 01:25:52,420
and I mean

962
01:25:52,420 --> 01:25:58,900
Immortality is certainly not living forever the pain you feel after fatal wounds become permanent

963
01:25:59,540 --> 01:26:01,540
lifelong agony

964
01:26:02,260 --> 01:26:07,140
For instance if a human drowns they feel indescribable fear and pain for seconds

965
01:26:07,460 --> 01:26:14,980
Maybe minutes at worst and then are swept away by the mercy of death. She fucked his brains out. What?

966
01:26:15,940 --> 01:26:19,620
No, if I could never be immortal because like watching people you love grow up and die

967
01:26:19,620 --> 01:26:23,140
Then you can never form your relationships and everything just dies around you. It's just kind of sad

968
01:26:24,980 --> 01:26:29,780
It was the only good thing I think I would just like to see how humans progress in like a million years

969
01:26:29,780 --> 01:26:34,020
But that's a long time but not a long time for like an immortal. So you never know

970
01:26:36,340 --> 01:26:43,860
An immortal human would continue to drown thrashing and screaming soundlessly until help came if it came

971
01:26:45,780 --> 01:26:46,820
So

972
01:26:46,820 --> 01:26:49,860
For a moral human to be cursed with cosmic permanence

973
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:52,580
Immortality is terror beyond death

974
01:26:53,380 --> 01:26:56,980
Book realize this and is tormenting me until I take it back

975
01:26:57,940 --> 01:27:01,540
Wait, but I want to smooch you so I can get you smooch

976
01:27:03,780 --> 01:27:07,060
How come you just don't take it back then wouldn't they let you go if you did?

977
01:27:08,420 --> 01:27:13,940
If cosmic permanence was something that could be undone it wouldn't be permanent would it?

978
01:27:15,940 --> 01:27:20,420
Yeah, when bucky finds you when he gets his hands on you

979
01:27:22,180 --> 01:27:24,180
I didn't have to talk there

980
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:27,460
When bucky finds you what he gets his hands on you

981
01:27:28,740 --> 01:27:32,580
Well, everyone you will know dialogue isn't really a hold for me people still get pets even though they know

982
01:27:32,740 --> 01:27:34,740
They'll outlive them. It's so worth it

983
01:27:35,140 --> 01:27:37,140
But that's like that's a that's a thing unto itself

984
01:27:37,220 --> 01:27:40,980
Would you would you be like a like an omniman and just see people as pets?

985
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:46,500
But you wouldn't you wouldn't value human life anymore. You wouldn't see humans wouldn't be human to you anymore

986
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:48,500
You would lose your humanity in the process

987
01:27:51,140 --> 01:27:53,540
It's a different relationship from a human to a pet

988
01:27:55,220 --> 01:27:57,060
um

989
01:27:57,060 --> 01:28:03,060
For pets, it's an emotional bond for humans. It's a there's many many many different bonds

990
01:28:06,020 --> 01:28:08,660
I feel like you need me to be able to help fill the void that's true

991
01:28:09,620 --> 01:28:12,900
I think you everybody would like I would just become a very

992
01:28:14,660 --> 01:28:16,420
nihilistic

993
01:28:16,420 --> 01:28:18,420
immortal

994
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:24,180
If I get if it's like omniman and I get my own wife that makes me remember happiness

995
01:28:25,540 --> 01:28:27,540
Wait humans are oh my god. You guys are terrible

996
01:28:29,140 --> 01:28:31,140
It's terrible

997
01:28:31,860 --> 01:28:33,860
I

998
01:28:35,540 --> 01:28:36,420
I'm on the other side

999
01:28:36,420 --> 01:28:39,140
I think life is pointless because we die if I could live forever

1000
01:28:39,140 --> 01:28:41,940
There's so much that I could learn to do good. Okay, understandable

1001
01:28:42,580 --> 01:28:45,620
It seems like a lot of you would be immortal

1002
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:49,060
Very interesting very interesting indeed

1003
01:28:53,220 --> 01:28:55,220
Buck is already here

1004
01:28:55,460 --> 01:29:02,180
The voice from the other side of my bedroom door, I didn't even hear him coming

1005
01:29:03,860 --> 01:29:08,260
Think of the vtubers we have in a hundred years. They would just be straight up androids walking around

1006
01:29:08,740 --> 01:29:11,140
There wouldn't be vt. Just be someone piloting a mech

1007
01:29:12,500 --> 01:29:15,940
Someone to just transport their consciousness into an android

1008
01:29:20,980 --> 01:29:22,980
Buck they're here

1009
01:29:23,780 --> 01:29:30,980
Hello in there it would appear you have my book my nani desuka and my god inside that room with you

1010
01:29:32,980 --> 01:29:34,980
The good news is

1011
01:29:35,780 --> 01:29:41,700
Number 15 you're holding all the cards. The last thing you want to do is to be holding all the cards

1012
01:29:45,060 --> 01:29:50,980
As long as nani is unharmed she's she's fine. I just tied her up

1013
01:29:53,220 --> 01:29:56,260
Is that so then it looks like we can make a deal

1014
01:29:58,180 --> 01:30:00,820
If you let us in we'll take nani and go

1015
01:30:02,260 --> 01:30:06,740
What no way once that door is open. I'm going missing for sure

1016
01:30:09,700 --> 01:30:11,700
Do you realize the situation you're in

1017
01:30:15,620 --> 01:30:22,340
No, what number 15 she be foot lettuce the first thing you'd want in your burger is she be's feet

1018
01:30:23,140 --> 01:30:25,140
You

1019
01:30:30,580 --> 01:30:34,580
We can storm in and take the book the girl and the god by force

1020
01:30:37,220 --> 01:30:41,860
Come on crypto so legit, bro. I just got the like this this eat the other day like in theory

1021
01:30:41,860 --> 01:30:46,340
And you know what that is, bro? So like I was on the market. I was like, um, I want to see my robin hood account, man

1022
01:30:46,340 --> 01:30:48,740
Like it's like I'll show you bro. It's like just look at my phone

1023
01:30:50,660 --> 01:30:52,660
This game seems familiar

1024
01:30:53,940 --> 01:30:57,620
Then how come you haven't done it already

1025
01:30:58,980 --> 01:31:01,300
You might get a lucky shot on one of us before you died

1026
01:31:01,860 --> 01:31:07,860
Like I assumed you did nani and if the injury was serious you'd be stuck with it for the next who knows how many years with it

1027
01:31:09,620 --> 01:31:12,740
All of that is too much to risk over you, you know, understandable

1028
01:31:14,180 --> 01:31:17,300
Right and so you'll just let me watch on while it's on out of here

1029
01:31:18,020 --> 01:31:22,420
We get dozens of people trapped in our woods every week. It means nothing to us if you escape

1030
01:31:23,540 --> 01:31:27,140
Even if I go straight to the police and tell them everything

1031
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:36,340
Oh, I did not like that noise there was like all the like gun reloading stuff

1032
01:31:37,140 --> 01:31:39,140
in the giggle

1033
01:31:39,140 --> 01:31:41,140
The police are already here

1034
01:31:42,020 --> 01:31:44,980
Open the door and you can keep rock saying the book

1035
01:31:45,460 --> 01:31:48,020
You don't know how I got these scars. I don't know my voice keeps changing

1036
01:31:48,900 --> 01:31:52,980
And if you don't you know it will happen you have 20 seconds to make your choice

1037
01:31:54,820 --> 01:31:56,820
Make my choice. What do I do?

1038
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:02,420
Uh, I can't do this

1039
01:32:04,660 --> 01:32:06,660
Well

1040
01:32:09,460 --> 01:32:13,140
I'm not gonna do it. I don't know what to do

1041
01:32:13,860 --> 01:32:15,860
You

1042
01:32:17,460 --> 01:32:19,940
Stop you'll hit the did I just get shot?

1043
01:32:21,380 --> 01:32:23,380
Did they just shoot her?

1044
01:32:23,940 --> 01:32:29,460
I quickly like back from the door awaiting the onslaught of cultists, but instead I hear footsteps retreating

1045
01:32:30,900 --> 01:32:35,460
Hey, Jackson. Thank you the super. What up? What up? I just got shot

1046
01:32:35,460 --> 01:32:45,380
Start us. Are you all right? I pat myself down quickly if I got hit it wasn't enough to make me lose consciousness

1047
01:32:45,540 --> 01:32:47,540
That'll have to do

1048
01:32:47,860 --> 01:32:51,300
What what gives why are they running away? Did I do something to scare them off?

1049
01:32:53,460 --> 01:32:57,140
They know you have to leave this room eventually so they're waiting to ambush you

1050
01:32:58,020 --> 01:33:00,020
Don't let your guard down. It could be anywhere

1051
01:33:00,820 --> 01:33:09,620
Um, I should probably do that freaking healing ritual on myself. Can I grab this? Oh, can I get a freaking knife?

1052
01:33:14,100 --> 01:33:20,260
Oh, you have little goat feet. Can I talk to you? No. All right, let me heal myself real quick

1053
01:33:21,060 --> 01:33:23,060
I

1054
01:33:25,620 --> 01:33:28,500
Should have some bulls drawn nearby and face the mirror does she get shot?

1055
01:33:30,420 --> 01:33:32,420
She she's dead, isn't she

1056
01:33:35,140 --> 01:33:38,420
She's straight up dead. I why am I not saying anything about that?

1057
01:33:41,700 --> 01:33:46,660
Use me as a human shield. Thank you. Thank you groomed by the other

1058
01:33:47,220 --> 01:33:49,220
I

1059
01:33:50,020 --> 01:33:52,020
Well, I can't heal her

1060
01:33:52,340 --> 01:33:56,420
Because if the intended target isn't the caster and isn't deceased

1061
01:33:57,780 --> 01:34:00,740
I don't know if she's deceased. Okay, that's there. Well, I'm gonna

1062
01:34:03,700 --> 01:34:05,700
Oh too fast

1063
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:12,500
What

1064
01:34:13,460 --> 01:34:18,260
I got green candles. Can I not heal myself?

1065
01:34:22,580 --> 01:34:28,260
Okay, I guess it doesn't matter. Okay, I guess that's not the point. Um, well, I'm taking your mask because it looks cool

1066
01:34:30,820 --> 01:34:32,820
I have to go to the bathroom

1067
01:34:35,940 --> 01:34:37,940
Hello

1068
01:34:39,860 --> 01:34:41,860
Damn they really shot at me

1069
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:44,500
Oh

1070
01:34:51,860 --> 01:34:58,740
Lovely bathroom we have here. What do we need to do in here? Oh, I have to perform rot bloom. How do I?

1071
01:35:03,380 --> 01:35:05,940
Pot of a plant which grew underwater within the black woods

1072
01:35:07,140 --> 01:35:10,980
Raw meat of an animal that died within the black woods petal of a flower that grew from the soil of the black woods

1073
01:35:12,580 --> 01:35:17,060
Show their new no let candles in the room with you face any plant in a room with your spawn partner present

1074
01:35:17,540 --> 01:35:19,540
And then blah blah blah. Okay

1075
01:35:20,580 --> 01:35:23,220
Um, then why am I in the

1076
01:35:24,580 --> 01:35:26,580
I can't do this

1077
01:35:27,060 --> 01:35:29,060
Oh eat

1078
01:35:30,420 --> 01:35:32,420
Okay

1079
01:35:32,980 --> 01:35:40,420
You know leather you seedling twos off little resistance

1080
01:35:42,820 --> 01:35:45,540
Watch out for jump scares. I know I'm ready. I'm ready to right click

1081
01:35:46,020 --> 01:35:49,140
I try to chew it, but it's hard as a rock. Something is off with the taste too

1082
01:35:49,780 --> 01:35:54,020
Managed to force it down whatever it was. I don't think it was poisonous, but I feel kind of sick now probably gonna move on

1083
01:35:54,740 --> 01:35:56,740
Um

1084
01:35:58,420 --> 01:36:02,500
Raw meat of an animal that died in the black woods. Is there raw meat in here?

1085
01:36:07,700 --> 01:36:10,100
Do I have to go get raw meat? Oh my god

1086
01:36:14,420 --> 01:36:17,060
Great time to freaking struggle

1087
01:36:18,020 --> 01:36:22,980
Oh wait, so it just says but it doesn't tell me where to go. That's so weird. All right. Well

1088
01:36:24,100 --> 01:36:26,100
I

1089
01:36:29,380 --> 01:36:31,380
Waiting to be attacked

1090
01:36:35,700 --> 01:36:40,100
Okay, this way open what the fuck are you doing?

1091
01:36:40,740 --> 01:36:42,740
Yeah

1092
01:36:53,620 --> 01:36:57,620
What oh, I thought I could like take him on

1093
01:37:00,260 --> 01:37:02,260
Okay, I guess not

1094
01:37:10,660 --> 01:37:16,580
Weird. Oh, there's another one. So if I died probably because there's nothing after that

1095
01:37:23,620 --> 01:37:26,500
Maybe avoid the room because you don't have the guitar, I guess so. Yeah

1096
01:37:26,740 --> 01:37:28,740
Yeah

1097
01:37:32,900 --> 01:37:39,060
Okay, what if I go maybe I'll go find something to defend myself can I turn?

1098
01:37:46,100 --> 01:37:48,100
Going the wrong way, yeah

1099
01:37:49,940 --> 01:37:51,940
Nope

1100
01:37:52,740 --> 01:37:54,740
Are you still there?

1101
01:38:02,180 --> 01:38:11,860
Okay, so we don't go that way back away from a threat hiding behind a door interesting. Um

1102
01:38:15,300 --> 01:38:17,300
Can I just leave

1103
01:38:22,180 --> 01:38:24,180
I

1104
01:38:24,500 --> 01:38:26,500
What the frick

1105
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:36,740
Can I like pick up something to defend myself? Okay, so this is like if I sneak up on them. I'm a presuming

1106
01:38:41,460 --> 01:38:45,780
I feel like if I jump in here that something's gonna get me

1107
01:38:45,940 --> 01:38:55,380
Because I know he's right there because I peeked in from there nobody's there. I don't know

1108
01:38:58,900 --> 01:39:00,900
Oh

1109
01:39:03,060 --> 01:39:07,460
Ew beef tartar nice

1110
01:39:07,860 --> 01:39:15,780
What's an incredible smell a rich warm, sorry, I'm reading fast

1111
01:39:16,820 --> 01:39:21,620
Because I'm like so so like whoa right now a rich warm scent clouds my senses setting my stomach

1112
01:39:21,620 --> 01:39:27,060
I wasn't instantly I followed my nose and leads back to the meat could it really be to just get bad a bad first piece or something

1113
01:39:27,540 --> 01:39:31,060
I didn't like take another bite and a wave is said. Oh, she's getting the

1114
01:39:31,540 --> 01:39:34,980
Alien baby in her and it's growing and it wants more food

1115
01:39:35,620 --> 01:39:38,260
My appetite kicks an overdrive. I've never tasted anything like it

1116
01:39:38,820 --> 01:39:42,420
A third piece and a fourth and a fifth. It's like I've gone my whole life without eating until now

1117
01:39:42,660 --> 01:39:46,740
The second between bites feel like an attorney to withdraw eventually my hunger abates

1118
01:39:46,740 --> 01:39:48,740
But only after I stripped it clean to the marrow

1119
01:39:49,380 --> 01:39:53,140
I need to get one last ingredient a pedal pedal of a flower that grew in the blackwoods

1120
01:39:53,140 --> 01:39:56,980
I walk away and I land the bowl. Okay. Uh, I forget where that was

1121
01:39:57,700 --> 01:40:00,740
Oh, thank god. It shows me great. Um

1122
01:40:01,620 --> 01:40:07,300
That's right. I got to go to that bedroom

1123
01:40:12,260 --> 01:40:15,460
He oh nope not that way

1124
01:40:19,780 --> 01:40:21,780
Wait, is this the only

1125
01:40:30,820 --> 01:40:35,540
Oh my god, I don't like that swinging noise shut up

1126
01:40:43,860 --> 01:40:47,060
I guess let's keep going straight are there

1127
01:40:50,340 --> 01:40:52,340
I thought the flower wasn't here

1128
01:40:54,580 --> 01:40:56,580
No

1129
01:40:56,740 --> 01:40:58,740
Oh

1130
01:41:02,500 --> 01:41:04,500
Frick

1131
01:41:08,980 --> 01:41:11,140
What the heck I didn't know that could happen

1132
01:41:14,900 --> 01:41:16,900
Yeah, I know I'm trying to get there

1133
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:24,340
Mortis no, I didn't bonk the goat yet sadly

1134
01:41:26,660 --> 01:41:28,660
Delicious

1135
01:41:32,020 --> 01:41:34,520
All right, so

1136
01:41:41,300 --> 01:41:43,300
They're not in there

1137
01:41:46,580 --> 01:41:48,580
I wonder if I open it too fast

1138
01:41:56,580 --> 01:41:58,580
Oh

1139
01:42:08,260 --> 01:42:10,260
Frick

1140
01:42:15,380 --> 01:42:17,380
Okay, it doesn't matter

1141
01:42:21,300 --> 01:42:23,300
They gave me a little

1142
01:42:23,940 --> 01:42:28,180
I just want a day to go. That's all I want

1143
01:42:32,660 --> 01:42:35,860
Okay, okay, okay, okay, it's fine

1144
01:42:39,540 --> 01:42:41,540
Okay

1145
01:42:48,740 --> 01:42:51,540
Okay, don't go freaking that way

1146
01:42:53,460 --> 01:42:55,460
Oh

1147
01:43:00,820 --> 01:43:02,820
If you see a hint

1148
01:43:05,460 --> 01:43:12,820
If you see a hint of skull oops, no, that's not what I meant to do

1149
01:43:15,940 --> 01:43:17,940
If you see a hint of skull

1150
01:43:19,780 --> 01:43:21,780
Go the other way

1151
01:43:23,540 --> 01:43:25,540
Oh

1152
01:43:36,340 --> 01:43:38,340
Okay, I'm fine

1153
01:43:41,860 --> 01:43:43,860
I think there was one over here

1154
01:43:44,500 --> 01:43:53,700
No, okay PTSD kicking

1155
01:43:56,260 --> 01:43:59,140
All right, is there gonna be one by the over here

1156
01:44:04,020 --> 01:44:08,900
Yeah, okay, there's one right there. I saw you you fucking bitch

1157
01:44:14,420 --> 01:44:22,340
Okay, we're good

1158
01:44:27,380 --> 01:44:29,380
It's literally just gotta go up the stairs

1159
01:44:30,340 --> 01:44:32,340
Is

1160
01:44:40,580 --> 01:44:45,620
Standing there in medicine late, is there oh, oh, don't go fucking that way Jesus fuck

1161
01:44:50,500 --> 01:44:52,500
Am I going okay to my brother's room

1162
01:44:52,580 --> 01:44:59,540
Okay, I need to be down is there is it following me no, okay

1163
01:45:05,540 --> 01:45:07,540
I need to go in there

1164
01:45:09,380 --> 01:45:16,900
Can I like trick it pretend that we just walk past each other? Oh come on you bitch sliding door

1165
01:45:18,660 --> 01:45:20,660
Simulator

1166
01:45:22,500 --> 01:45:24,500
What the frick am I supposed to do?

1167
01:45:26,580 --> 01:45:28,580
I can't do it unless I have the pedal

1168
01:45:32,740 --> 01:45:37,220
I think you need to go in there see what happens. I disagree actually with that statement

1169
01:45:38,980 --> 01:45:40,980
I'm gonna go to my bedroom

1170
01:45:44,020 --> 01:45:46,580
I think this is a safe spot so I'm gonna go in here

1171
01:45:47,140 --> 01:45:52,900
I talked to you. No, okay, then I'm gonna go back. She's dead taking that

1172
01:46:03,700 --> 01:46:05,700
Make sure I go the right way

1173
01:46:12,500 --> 01:46:14,500
Are you serious

1174
01:46:16,580 --> 01:46:18,580
Oh

1175
01:46:40,340 --> 01:46:42,340
Oh my god

1176
01:46:47,460 --> 01:46:50,980
I'll sit towards me the horror wait, what about the guys that are in there?

1177
01:46:52,100 --> 01:46:57,540
Huh my heart begins beating get my conscience returns to me. I'm curled up in the ground in the corner of the room

1178
01:46:58,340 --> 01:47:04,180
My face is wet with tears. I feel like silver hours have passed the flowers gone. Nothing remains of it my vague memory

1179
01:47:04,900 --> 01:47:06,900
inexplicable

1180
01:47:07,460 --> 01:47:09,460
Inexplicable sense of dread

1181
01:47:09,780 --> 01:47:11,780
They're still

1182
01:47:12,340 --> 01:47:14,340
All right

1183
01:47:14,340 --> 01:47:16,340
Don't mind me

1184
01:47:16,820 --> 01:47:18,820
I

1185
01:47:19,460 --> 01:47:21,460
Enjoy

1186
01:47:24,900 --> 01:47:26,900
Don't mind me at all

1187
01:47:32,340 --> 01:47:37,860
All right, uh, let's do this thing sure there are new no candles

1188
01:47:40,420 --> 01:47:42,420
Snuff

1189
01:47:42,500 --> 01:47:49,060
All right, we got the pot raw meat. Oh good thing. I did that in order

1190
01:47:49,780 --> 01:47:55,220
Uh, well, I think because it guides you it's kind of hard not to the petal of flower got that

1191
01:47:56,180 --> 01:47:59,140
No, the candles face any plant in a room

1192
01:48:00,260 --> 01:48:03,780
Okay, any plant. Well, there's a fucking

1193
01:48:04,980 --> 01:48:08,100
There's a plant right there. Technically. Do I face the tree?

1194
01:48:08,260 --> 01:48:10,260
Ha ha ha ha

1195
01:48:22,340 --> 01:48:25,620
Have you heard of what I have not heard of that. No

1196
01:48:27,860 --> 01:48:29,860
Summer nominee for number no

1197
01:48:32,980 --> 01:48:35,300
Uh summer I'm doing all yours. I don't want to get it through

1198
01:48:35,860 --> 01:48:37,860
I'm super cool

1199
01:48:38,820 --> 01:48:40,820
So

1200
01:48:42,580 --> 01:48:44,580
What

1201
01:48:45,300 --> 01:48:47,300
Are you doing people?

1202
01:49:06,660 --> 01:49:08,660
Just keep it up. I mean I'm beat them up

1203
01:49:09,620 --> 01:49:14,020
Walka walka. Hey, that's not the same song that I was I was thinking uh

1204
01:49:14,980 --> 01:49:17,540
Summer number none and you shut up the circle

1205
01:49:18,260 --> 01:49:22,580
Wait summer number none. Hey, I get it. I get it. Sorry. I'm tired

1206
01:49:24,500 --> 01:49:26,820
Well done. We're so close. I can taste it

1207
01:49:27,940 --> 01:49:31,460
This feeling of hope welling in my chest so unfamiliar

1208
01:49:33,300 --> 01:49:37,940
I he did disappoint you but we're trapped in a pretty terrible situation

1209
01:49:38,500 --> 01:49:41,380
I'm not sure if escape is realistic at this point

1210
01:49:42,660 --> 01:49:47,060
I have no many I have no idea how many of them there are and I know they're armed

1211
01:49:47,460 --> 01:49:49,940
I can't safely get out of this room anymore

1212
01:49:51,140 --> 01:49:53,140
Actually, I can I just got a creep around

1213
01:49:54,260 --> 01:49:57,620
The chances are that I'm going to walk around to one of their traps eventually

1214
01:49:58,020 --> 01:50:00,980
Even if I'm on guard every minute of every ritual left

1215
01:50:02,660 --> 01:50:04,660
We may yet make it out of this

1216
01:50:05,620 --> 01:50:07,460
I know what ritual is next

1217
01:50:08,260 --> 01:50:13,140
As long as Nani stays down. This will be easy. She's dead. She was shot

1218
01:50:15,300 --> 01:50:17,300
Nani is dead

1219
01:50:17,700 --> 01:50:21,620
What's up with Nani Nani disco Nani? No, she's dead

1220
01:50:22,900 --> 01:50:24,340
She was shot

1221
01:50:24,340 --> 01:50:28,180
You know how I mentioned that won't be in need of a sacrifice the time has come

1222
01:50:29,860 --> 01:50:31,860
Will that blood get there?

1223
01:50:32,020 --> 01:50:36,580
Sacrifice who Nani isn't she?

1224
01:50:38,340 --> 01:50:40,340
She's still okay. So she's still alive

1225
01:50:41,620 --> 01:50:48,340
Normally one or two fatal injuries won't be enough to kill her since she's one of a thousand but oddly enough she's slipping away

1226
01:50:49,620 --> 01:50:53,060
We'll have to work quickly cold blood can't be used as a sacrificed

1227
01:50:53,780 --> 01:50:56,020
Well, it takes a while for blood to cool

1228
01:50:56,900 --> 01:50:59,540
She'll be sacrificed after all that's happened to her

1229
01:51:00,500 --> 01:51:02,500
I can't just leave her like this, right?

1230
01:51:02,980 --> 01:51:04,420
Nah

1231
01:51:04,420 --> 01:51:08,740
I'm sacrificing her bro. Uh, there's blood right there

1232
01:51:12,980 --> 01:51:19,780
Oh, that's terrifying this ritual will call upon any and all firstborns. Oh firstborns. I thought this was first bones

1233
01:51:21,140 --> 01:51:25,860
Within the blackwoods together pretentious amount of fresh blood vile for many rituals including uprooting

1234
01:51:26,180 --> 01:51:30,740
If you are death shy follow these steps to avoid being targeted chant near your spawn partner

1235
01:51:31,380 --> 01:51:37,140
Logna you ignore lohafna after chanting immediately leave the room. Do not return early

1236
01:51:40,740 --> 01:51:42,740
Continued on next page

1237
01:51:45,220 --> 01:51:50,260
It kill me it kill me I ate someone

1238
01:51:56,820 --> 01:51:59,380
All right, then what is this some

1239
01:52:03,380 --> 01:52:05,300
Little bit of

1240
01:52:05,300 --> 01:52:07,300
monica in my life

1241
01:52:07,620 --> 01:52:09,620
Little bit of Jessica is all I need

1242
01:52:10,740 --> 01:52:14,420
Little bit of me makes me your man. I don't like this looks like skin

1243
01:52:15,460 --> 01:52:17,780
veins. It's definitely like capillaries

1244
01:52:19,700 --> 01:52:21,540
Well, uh

1245
01:52:21,540 --> 01:52:24,180
Chant near your spawn partner. So let me just face her

1246
01:52:25,860 --> 01:52:27,860
I just feel like that's insane

1247
01:52:32,500 --> 01:52:34,500
Gotta go

1248
01:52:43,300 --> 01:52:45,300
That sounds nice

1249
01:52:46,980 --> 01:52:48,980
It's going great hi

1250
01:52:50,100 --> 01:52:52,100
I think it's good

1251
01:52:56,580 --> 01:52:59,940
I kind of want a peek

1252
01:53:02,980 --> 01:53:04,980
Oh

1253
01:53:09,060 --> 01:53:14,580
I might have been a little bit too early it was quiet so I thought it was good

1254
01:53:20,980 --> 01:53:22,980
Frick do I got to do all that again

1255
01:53:23,300 --> 01:53:25,300
Yeah

1256
01:53:27,300 --> 01:53:31,140
All right, you can keep your hat I keep taking me the hat the hat away. All right

1257
01:53:36,820 --> 01:53:38,820
I just gotta say

1258
01:53:44,500 --> 01:53:46,500
Okay, well

1259
01:53:46,900 --> 01:53:48,900
I

1260
01:53:51,780 --> 01:53:53,780
Happens if I just stand here

1261
01:54:05,460 --> 01:54:07,460
Objective survive

1262
01:54:10,020 --> 01:54:15,220
map I gotta go to only fans. Oh wait. No, I gotta go to

1263
01:54:16,580 --> 01:54:18,580
The basement

1264
01:54:19,220 --> 01:54:21,220
Floor

1265
01:54:24,660 --> 01:54:26,660
That kind of scared me

1266
01:54:32,820 --> 01:54:40,100
What's what's the love floor I don't I don't understand that I know I took too long I was waiting to come get stuff

1267
01:54:40,100 --> 01:54:42,100
I

1268
01:54:46,180 --> 01:54:54,900
Was waiting to see what happened. All right, let's let's go yippie we gotta go down to the basement

1269
01:55:00,980 --> 01:55:02,980
Let's go

1270
01:55:10,420 --> 01:55:14,180
Do I have to be careful of there in the room

1271
01:55:25,780 --> 01:55:27,780
Okay

1272
01:55:32,340 --> 01:55:34,340
Oh yep

1273
01:55:35,460 --> 01:55:37,460
That baby is coming

1274
01:55:40,260 --> 01:55:48,740
Where's the ladder there it is

1275
01:55:54,420 --> 01:55:58,020
What the hey what the hell

1276
01:56:05,540 --> 01:56:07,540
What's happening

1277
01:56:08,500 --> 01:56:12,660
Uh do I do I say anything about this do I

1278
01:56:14,980 --> 01:56:16,980
Oh

1279
01:56:17,700 --> 01:56:22,420
The hot oh now it tells me nowhere within the blackwoods is safe except for the heart of the woods

1280
01:56:22,420 --> 01:56:27,460
The hearts will hide your scent from them to avoid firstborns. Anyway, avoid making eye contact. They will know if you saw them

1281
01:56:29,060 --> 01:56:33,220
Move quickly, but do not run you will attract their attention be observant. Do not look

1282
01:56:34,100 --> 01:56:40,580
At the next page until you've reached the hearts. Okay. Well, I'm in the hearts. This is the hearts

1283
01:56:41,940 --> 01:56:43,940
You see me

1284
01:56:45,300 --> 01:56:47,300
What

1285
01:56:47,940 --> 01:56:51,300
What what what

1286
01:56:52,500 --> 01:56:54,500
What I don't like the baby noises

1287
01:56:55,620 --> 01:56:57,460
Wait for the candles to go out

1288
01:56:57,460 --> 01:57:01,620
Do not leave the heart of the woods until the candles go on their own no matter what you see are here

1289
01:57:02,020 --> 01:57:05,700
Once the candles go out leave immediately return to the room where the ritual began find what they left for you and chant

1290
01:57:05,700 --> 01:57:07,700
Three times and the ritual

1291
01:57:08,500 --> 01:57:10,500
Once the candles go out leave immediately

1292
01:57:13,220 --> 01:57:15,220
Okay, they're left on their own

1293
01:57:19,300 --> 01:57:21,300
Leave immediately, okay

1294
01:57:26,100 --> 01:57:28,100
Are they still around

1295
01:57:32,020 --> 01:57:34,020
I

1296
01:57:38,180 --> 01:57:40,180
I'm scared. I don't know

1297
01:57:45,300 --> 01:57:47,300
Are they still around

1298
01:57:48,820 --> 01:57:52,020
I'm scared. I'm moving my microphone away from my face

1299
01:57:55,940 --> 01:57:58,420
Because I know I'm gonna jump and smack into it

1300
01:58:02,020 --> 01:58:04,020
I should have done this for the heartbeat monitor

1301
01:58:13,220 --> 01:58:15,220
Okay, okay, then

1302
01:58:15,380 --> 01:58:17,380
You

1303
01:58:29,540 --> 01:58:33,380
Find what they left for me by lately

1304
01:58:36,740 --> 01:58:38,740
Oh

1305
01:58:40,100 --> 01:58:42,100
Got it, but what exactly is it

1306
01:58:43,060 --> 01:58:47,940
Open the sack the contents are darker. Looks like if you mix another feel it smells kind of like fresh wine

1307
01:58:48,660 --> 01:58:53,700
I close the sack up ignoring the sight of two bright red fingers floating to the top

1308
01:58:54,340 --> 01:58:58,660
No time to recover from all this this excitement. I've got to end this ritual

1309
01:59:00,580 --> 01:59:02,580
Okay

1310
01:59:03,780 --> 01:59:05,780
One

1311
01:59:08,500 --> 01:59:10,500
Two

1312
01:59:12,500 --> 01:59:14,500
Three

1313
01:59:16,340 --> 01:59:22,660
Okay, oh so it's pretty much like doing it for me so that I don't have to like bleed out nonnie myself

1314
01:59:25,300 --> 01:59:27,300
Who can I put it on

1315
01:59:28,580 --> 01:59:32,100
How wonderful with all this fresh blood we're as good as home free

1316
01:59:33,140 --> 01:59:38,740
Soon we will finally leave Sacramento behind. Hopefully wherever you spend the remainder of your reality

1317
01:59:38,740 --> 01:59:40,740
You'll be greener pastures as well

1318
01:59:41,700 --> 01:59:43,140
Yeah

1319
01:59:43,140 --> 01:59:44,340
Wait

1320
01:59:44,340 --> 01:59:45,860
Oh, what?

1321
01:59:45,860 --> 01:59:48,180
Sorry, I swear it said start off in the beginning

1322
01:59:48,980 --> 01:59:51,140
Wait, what do you mean remainder of my reality?

1323
01:59:52,820 --> 01:59:58,660
I know it's a lot to take in but because I'm an outer god everything in this reality is my dream

1324
01:59:59,700 --> 02:00:01,300
Including you

1325
02:00:01,300 --> 02:00:06,100
Sometime after I'm uprooted. I will wake up in this reality will end

1326
02:00:06,340 --> 02:00:08,340
And

1327
02:00:08,660 --> 02:00:11,780
Nah, I'm no better or worse than any other human

1328
02:00:14,980 --> 02:00:16,980
Yes

1329
02:00:17,220 --> 02:00:23,140
And I'm part of this dream meaning I'll probably vanish too

1330
02:00:26,900 --> 02:00:28,900
Most likely

1331
02:00:30,260 --> 02:00:31,380
So

1332
02:00:31,380 --> 02:00:34,100
That makes me your dream girl technically

1333
02:00:34,100 --> 02:00:40,900
Well, that's one takeaway from the existential atom bomb. I just dropped on you, but yes, I suppose so

1334
02:00:42,740 --> 02:00:44,740
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh

1335
02:00:48,340 --> 02:00:50,340
Cool

1336
02:00:51,300 --> 02:00:55,380
Cool indeed, but it's about to get very very hot

1337
02:00:56,100 --> 02:01:02,580
Uprooting me will cause the entire black woods to burn down. So you'll need to run when can I smooch you?

1338
02:01:04,500 --> 02:01:06,500
What I haven't done any smooching

1339
02:01:10,100 --> 02:01:12,100
You know what I want I want some Nutella

1340
02:01:15,060 --> 02:01:17,060
I think I

1341
02:01:34,100 --> 02:01:36,100
Oh my god

1342
02:01:50,260 --> 02:01:52,420
I still don't want to stop walking over from

1343
02:01:54,740 --> 02:01:56,740
What's it called?

1344
02:01:56,740 --> 02:01:58,740
I

1345
02:02:01,860 --> 02:02:03,860
The Korean thing

1346
02:02:27,060 --> 02:02:29,060
Oh

1347
02:02:53,540 --> 02:02:55,540
It's Korean soup waffle

1348
02:02:57,220 --> 02:02:59,220
Oh

1349
02:03:00,900 --> 02:03:05,540
You're golden. Isn't this only chapter one? Oh my god, you're right. There's so much to do

1350
02:03:13,220 --> 02:03:16,900
Get up some snacks. Hmm. It's like a bueno

1351
02:03:20,900 --> 02:03:22,900
Ashibi is eating

1352
02:03:23,220 --> 02:03:26,340
Some sweet stuff from her own imagination

1353
02:03:30,580 --> 02:03:33,140
I guess everybody gets snacks. It's snack time

1354
02:03:38,260 --> 02:03:40,260
It's snack time

1355
02:03:43,540 --> 02:03:45,540
Really doing boomy

1356
02:03:46,420 --> 02:03:48,420
Oh

1357
02:03:51,700 --> 02:03:53,700
Big plop big stretch

1358
02:03:56,740 --> 02:03:58,740
Let me just hang it out

1359
02:04:02,020 --> 02:04:06,100
Why you snacks when I'm looking at the whole meal. Oh, you're so funny

1360
02:04:08,740 --> 02:04:11,380
Having posoles soon. What's posoles?

1361
02:04:12,180 --> 02:04:14,180
I

1362
02:04:19,860 --> 02:04:24,580
Don't have snacks, but this snack is right in front of you, sorry

1363
02:04:27,860 --> 02:04:29,860
Little joke callback

1364
02:04:30,980 --> 02:04:32,980
From five seconds to

1365
02:04:36,820 --> 02:04:39,300
This is a good idea this is this is pretty tasty

1366
02:04:41,380 --> 02:04:43,380
You

1367
02:04:50,900 --> 02:04:55,060
This morning for breakfast I made myself a banana protein shake

1368
02:04:57,940 --> 02:05:00,020
Boomi you can't have this you will die

1369
02:05:03,300 --> 02:05:08,420
And then for lunch I made that little rice bowl

1370
02:05:12,340 --> 02:05:14,340
With salmon and rice

1371
02:05:22,260 --> 02:05:26,740
I put leftover bean sprouts and Thai basil and jalapeno in it for my pho

1372
02:05:29,940 --> 02:05:36,740
And I have I like everything big um bagel seasoning so I have that so I just put that on there in some koopi mayo

1373
02:05:38,980 --> 02:05:40,980
A little bit of Thai chili sauce

1374
02:05:41,380 --> 02:05:48,580
And it tastes like a little um like a little little like almost like a poke bowl

1375
02:05:54,980 --> 02:06:00,820
I said snacks for everyone. I didn't say snacks for everyone. I said everybody get a snack and I steal a snack

1376
02:06:06,900 --> 02:06:08,900
What are you doing

1377
02:06:09,860 --> 02:06:14,500
Boomi you you don't even there's nothing for you here like you won't even like this

1378
02:06:15,460 --> 02:06:17,860
It's also dangerous for you to consume

1379
02:06:29,540 --> 02:06:31,540
That's an a oh, okay

1380
02:06:34,260 --> 02:06:36,820
And then I have a little stoop waffle with Nutella

1381
02:06:39,860 --> 02:06:41,860
I don't know what I would make for dinner though

1382
02:06:45,300 --> 02:06:48,420
I was digging through my cabinet and I realized I have some alfredo sauce

1383
02:06:49,460 --> 02:06:51,460
But I'll probably hurt my tummy, but

1384
02:06:52,420 --> 02:06:54,420
You know yolo

1385
02:06:55,140 --> 02:06:58,900
And I have spaghetti and I have frozen meatballs. So I'll probably make myself

1386
02:06:59,460 --> 02:07:01,780
Alfredo spaghetti with meatballs

1387
02:07:09,700 --> 02:07:11,700
Furry altar for Azura

1388
02:07:13,380 --> 02:07:15,700
This is Azura's dark form if you piss her off

1389
02:07:22,020 --> 02:07:24,020
Not if you take the lactate never

1390
02:07:26,020 --> 02:07:30,820
I have a whole box. You'll never make me take the lactate. I was dying yesterday night

1391
02:07:33,540 --> 02:07:38,020
Because the the the McFlurry caught up to me. I was I was suffering

1392
02:07:39,780 --> 02:07:41,780
You

1393
02:07:44,660 --> 02:07:50,260
Okay, there's literally like not even in any tunnel in here. I wonder why I saved this jar on this barely any in here

1394
02:07:55,620 --> 02:07:58,020
And I've been drinking water are you proud of me?

1395
02:08:06,180 --> 02:08:08,180
Now I'm gonna tell all over my hands

1396
02:08:09,860 --> 02:08:11,860
I need a napkin

1397
02:08:23,860 --> 02:08:30,100
I do that though, I'll be like curse you past self or yeah, thanks for my past self for having this around

1398
02:08:34,180 --> 02:08:36,180
Okay, I'm done snacking

1399
02:08:39,860 --> 02:08:43,220
Uh-uh-uh fix my pillow. How you doing?

1400
02:08:44,980 --> 02:08:49,780
She knocked out she didn't even like flick her ear to listen. She was she's asleep

1401
02:09:02,580 --> 02:09:04,580
Headphone back in

1402
02:09:09,780 --> 02:09:11,780
It's

1403
02:09:13,540 --> 02:09:15,540
Realized you've been doing this for two hours

1404
02:09:16,020 --> 02:09:20,900
I've only I haven't even finished the first chapter. Are we gonna endurance?

1405
02:09:21,780 --> 02:09:23,780
Sucker for love

1406
02:09:23,780 --> 02:09:25,780
Although I feel like we're towards the end of the first chapter

1407
02:09:28,820 --> 02:09:30,820
Just how far am I supposed to be running

1408
02:09:34,100 --> 02:09:37,540
I would say 60 miles just to be safe

1409
02:09:39,860 --> 02:09:40,900
I

1410
02:09:40,900 --> 02:09:42,900
What I like about this is that

1411
02:09:43,540 --> 02:09:50,020
It really does put into perspective like you're just a little like it doesn't cut corners with you being like a little

1412
02:09:52,100 --> 02:09:55,140
Human like oh like five miles away. No 60 miles like

1413
02:09:56,340 --> 02:09:58,340
perpetually throughout this um

1414
02:09:58,900 --> 02:10:03,700
Game you feel like hopeless like you're like everything's, you know, just like a little hopeless

1415
02:10:04,260 --> 02:10:10,020
I'm sorry smack the mic smack the mic smack my mic. Uh, wow

1416
02:10:12,820 --> 02:10:18,500
Wow, I turned myself down a little bit because I kept piquing the mic because my go XLR is too powerful

1417
02:10:20,740 --> 02:10:23,140
It's a horror. Yeah, but it's a dating horror game

1418
02:10:23,300 --> 02:10:25,300
I

1419
02:10:30,740 --> 02:10:34,100
Doing this is going to burn everything down within 60 miles

1420
02:10:35,940 --> 02:10:39,380
It's a small price to pay to excise the woods from your planet

1421
02:10:39,940 --> 02:10:46,660
Left unchecked. They will envelop the whole earth turning every human into either a cultist or fertilizer

1422
02:10:46,900 --> 02:10:48,900
Just

1423
02:10:49,460 --> 02:10:52,100
Think of it of like a widespread forest fire

1424
02:10:52,580 --> 02:10:59,540
And not even the worst one you've seen humanity has dealt with far larger wildfires before your towns will heal

1425
02:11:05,380 --> 02:11:08,820
So I just got a run for it once the fire starts

1426
02:11:10,020 --> 02:11:13,140
Don't stop running and leave the book behind to burn

1427
02:11:13,700 --> 02:11:19,300
If the thousand ever recovered it they could seed the blackwood skin and this will have all been for nothing

1428
02:11:21,860 --> 02:11:25,220
But what if they save the book before it turns to ash

1429
02:11:26,340 --> 02:11:28,500
Catch him. Let's go Pikachu

1430
02:11:30,180 --> 02:11:35,460
I think I'll stay to watch it burn if the blackwoods come back people will die

1431
02:11:36,580 --> 02:11:38,980
I probably wouldn't be able to pull this off twice

1432
02:11:39,860 --> 02:11:41,860
I

1433
02:11:42,260 --> 02:11:44,260
Suddenly raccoon city

1434
02:11:44,580 --> 02:11:46,580
Whatever time this world has left

1435
02:11:46,980 --> 02:11:50,900
I'll happily risk my life for it. Yeah, because I remember in the first game like you literally

1436
02:11:51,060 --> 02:11:57,380
It's like you're just you just accept the fact you're going to die and it's so it's a little terrifying how like normal

1437
02:11:58,900 --> 02:12:00,900
They approach it

1438
02:12:01,460 --> 02:12:05,460
But everything you went through it wouldn't have been easy for us

1439
02:12:06,580 --> 02:12:08,580
It had been from me

1440
02:12:09,620 --> 02:12:10,900
I

1441
02:12:10,900 --> 02:12:15,700
Can't let you do that after the things I've said the things I've done to you personally

1442
02:12:16,980 --> 02:12:20,340
You didn't do anything wrong. You didn't deserve any of this

1443
02:12:22,980 --> 02:12:26,100
Yeah, the emcee in the first was hundred percent more enhinged. He was just like, yeah

1444
02:12:27,540 --> 02:12:29,620
I wouldn't kiss you and she's just like what?

1445
02:12:32,180 --> 02:12:34,660
If it helps I'm not rolling over and dying

1446
02:12:35,220 --> 02:12:39,620
I'm going to run my heart as soon as I'm sure the buck is destroyed and you're safe

1447
02:12:41,620 --> 02:12:43,940
I don't know what to say

1448
02:12:45,940 --> 02:12:47,940
Thank you

1449
02:12:48,260 --> 02:12:51,780
Don't thank me yet. I've got to finish this last ritual

1450
02:12:55,540 --> 02:13:00,660
I can't tell if she's like her mouth is partially open or she has like a little goat buck tooth. I can't

1451
02:13:00,660 --> 02:13:05,460
I can't really tell. I think that's her just her mouth. Yeah, that's okay

1452
02:13:08,500 --> 02:13:10,500
What am I? I have to go to the fridge

1453
02:13:12,580 --> 02:13:16,020
If your life ship of the rocks in, Selva Eskura has soured or if you no longer

1454
02:13:16,020 --> 02:13:18,020
see the earth consumed by the blackwoods

1455
02:13:18,020 --> 02:13:20,420
This ritual is the only way to rid your reality of them for now

1456
02:13:20,980 --> 02:13:24,980
This ritual will cause the blackwoods to burn to ash and the hearts will return to their dormant state

1457
02:13:24,980 --> 02:13:27,940
This will allow you to escape from the blackwoods if you're warmed

1458
02:13:28,180 --> 02:13:31,060
You can never meaningfully leave the blackwoods once you've entered them

1459
02:13:33,620 --> 02:13:37,700
Have all the following on your person. The blood of at least 10 human-sized living things

1460
02:13:38,580 --> 02:13:39,620
Okay

1461
02:13:39,620 --> 02:13:45,140
Seed of rot bloom within you. Common flame accelerant like flour, cinnamon, cooking oil, nail polish, remover, hairspray

1462
02:13:45,300 --> 02:13:50,340
Go to the heart of the woods. We're facing a heart chant. Fumma na ma na mi na ma nishma na ma na. Okay

1463
02:13:50,980 --> 02:13:52,980
um

1464
02:13:53,060 --> 02:13:55,060
So I need

1465
02:13:58,900 --> 02:14:00,900
The blood

1466
02:14:02,900 --> 02:14:06,660
I have the rot bloom. I have the okay, so I just need to go to the get the cooking oil

1467
02:14:06,660 --> 02:14:08,980
That was downstairs because I already have that pile of blood

1468
02:14:09,620 --> 02:14:11,620
Thankfully, thank you miss

1469
02:14:12,420 --> 02:14:14,020
Nani

1470
02:14:14,020 --> 02:14:16,020
Do I have to

1471
02:14:16,100 --> 02:14:18,100
Could I just go downstairs?

1472
02:14:18,980 --> 02:14:20,980
Am I gonna have to freaking fight people?

1473
02:14:22,020 --> 02:14:24,020
Wait am I supposed to

1474
02:14:24,020 --> 02:14:26,020
Go to the bathroom first

1475
02:14:28,740 --> 02:14:30,740
I

1476
02:14:35,060 --> 02:14:41,300
Think they're gone, so I think they're good. I'm good. Uh, what am I doing in here? I need another seed

1477
02:14:47,140 --> 02:14:49,140
What's in here that I need

1478
02:14:51,620 --> 02:14:55,300
Oh the hairspray. Oh what I could have just get the cooking oil

1479
02:14:58,900 --> 02:15:00,260
Oh

1480
02:15:00,260 --> 02:15:03,540
It's either I get the cooking oil or the hairspray

1481
02:15:04,260 --> 02:15:05,220
Oh

1482
02:15:05,220 --> 02:15:07,220
Interest so I could have that's weird. I don't

1483
02:15:08,340 --> 02:15:12,820
Well, I'm assuming a lot of people go for the first one. I wonder if it makes a difference

1484
02:15:17,860 --> 02:15:21,300
You spin me right around baby right around

1485
02:15:23,460 --> 02:15:25,460
Where am I

1486
02:15:25,940 --> 02:15:27,940
Okay, I gotta go to the heart

1487
02:15:33,140 --> 02:15:39,620
Hi rena rena's just staring at me. I'd be so mad if one of those things pop out

1488
02:15:43,220 --> 02:15:45,940
Wait, what out to this room

1489
02:15:51,940 --> 02:15:53,940
Jumping up and down

1490
02:15:56,180 --> 02:15:58,180
Simlish is just eldritch

1491
02:15:58,660 --> 02:16:00,660
I didn't mean to exit

1492
02:16:03,540 --> 02:16:08,580
All right in chant, you know, I want to what was there a hook

1493
02:16:10,180 --> 02:16:13,300
I want to I want to chant at this one in particular

1494
02:16:25,860 --> 02:16:28,500
It actually did it you really actually did it

1495
02:16:30,020 --> 02:16:35,940
And so the blackwoods have been destroyed may something green and good grow from its ashes

1496
02:16:37,220 --> 02:16:40,900
I am so so proud of you. I can't thank you enough

1497
02:16:42,180 --> 02:16:44,180
It's ironic, isn't it?

1498
02:16:44,180 --> 02:16:47,060
The day I get my wish of never having to see a human again

1499
02:16:48,180 --> 02:16:50,580
It's the same day. I finally meet one worth knowing

1500
02:16:52,260 --> 02:16:53,860
There she goes

1501
02:16:53,860 --> 02:16:55,860
It's like an oven in here already

1502
02:16:56,420 --> 02:16:58,900
I hear frantic commotion. He must be coming

1503
02:16:59,860 --> 02:17:00,740
Huh?

1504
02:17:00,740 --> 02:17:02,740
The book is blackening in my hand

1505
02:17:03,220 --> 02:17:05,220
I must be engulfed in fire

1506
02:17:05,300 --> 02:17:10,980
The blackwoods even at the bitter end must be preventing me from feeling the flames at least that's nice

1507
02:17:11,620 --> 02:17:13,620
At least I don't have to feel myself burning to death

1508
02:17:16,980 --> 02:17:19,380
So I'm guessing the next chapters is when I get to smoocher

1509
02:17:20,180 --> 02:17:23,700
As long as I'm sure the book burns the very last page. This is fine

1510
02:17:24,740 --> 02:17:28,900
Looks like that's it. I'm still in one piece. I can run for the door

1511
02:17:32,900 --> 02:17:34,900
Yo

1512
02:17:36,340 --> 02:17:40,020
Soldier boy, tell him right now. I'm sorry. I need to put you on the ground

1513
02:17:41,460 --> 02:17:43,460
I can't have you on my desk. There's too much stuff up here

1514
02:17:49,220 --> 02:17:51,860
Now I got a little dance for y'all called the soldier boy

1515
02:17:52,660 --> 02:17:54,660
Yo

1516
02:17:55,700 --> 02:17:57,700
Did something scary happen?

1517
02:17:59,300 --> 02:18:01,300
What wait, what?

1518
02:18:02,020 --> 02:18:05,380
Huh, huh? She's so cute. Oh my god. Look how cute she is

1519
02:18:06,820 --> 02:18:08,820
Excuse me

1520
02:18:09,620 --> 02:18:14,180
Get tight another episode of sucker for love at date to die for is coming up

1521
02:18:15,060 --> 02:18:18,660
Oh, I can't believe I wasn't able to get the stupid book back

1522
02:18:18,900 --> 02:18:23,460
I guess I've got to get involved now. The book is mine

1523
02:18:24,340 --> 02:18:26,340
Next time on sucker for love

1524
02:18:27,060 --> 02:18:29,700
House of wax. I can't wait

1525
02:18:33,620 --> 02:18:35,620
Oh my goodness

1526
02:18:38,100 --> 02:18:40,100
Get true ending for chapter one and two to unlaw

1527
02:18:42,340 --> 02:18:44,740
Get true ending for chapter nine what?

1528
02:18:49,620 --> 02:18:51,620
Wait, is that look no, it's not

1529
02:18:52,820 --> 02:18:54,820
We just get a cliff every day. Okay, however

1530
02:18:56,180 --> 02:18:58,180
Uh, hold on. I'm gonna

1531
02:18:59,300 --> 02:19:04,340
See what happens if I open the door just to see what like if I if buck kills me

1532
02:19:06,260 --> 02:19:08,760
I wonder what's happens if I don't do any of that stuff

1533
02:19:18,740 --> 02:19:20,740
All right, that should do it

1534
02:19:31,060 --> 02:19:33,060
He's a rot bloom, okay

1535
02:19:37,140 --> 02:19:39,140
Uh

1536
02:19:39,300 --> 02:19:50,100
The woods fatten themselves on those dead feeds the woods the living feed the woods whose blood's the tree feeding

1537
02:19:52,580 --> 02:19:54,580
Um

1538
02:19:59,140 --> 02:20:01,140
I can't read it

1539
02:20:09,140 --> 02:20:13,780
Oh, okay. This is what happened before I guess it just didn't work

1540
02:20:20,180 --> 02:20:22,180
I'm gonna go

1541
02:20:29,540 --> 02:20:31,540
Is that

1542
02:20:33,140 --> 02:20:36,660
Okay, it's just bad and okay if I survived buck

1543
02:20:36,900 --> 02:20:40,260
Hit the book. Oh, no

1544
02:20:44,020 --> 02:20:46,020
Did I do something wrong?

1545
02:20:53,620 --> 02:20:59,540
But how what's the other thing that I do do I do it incorrectly?

1546
02:21:02,020 --> 02:21:05,140
Oops, what am I doing? Um because

1547
02:21:07,380 --> 02:21:09,380
If I

1548
02:21:11,220 --> 02:21:14,340
So I ate the pot ate the meat ate the pedal then what is this?

1549
02:21:16,820 --> 02:21:18,820
I did everything

1550
02:21:20,260 --> 02:21:22,820
Because I'm thinking this is the true ending down here

1551
02:21:28,340 --> 02:21:35,140
Oh, oh I could heal Nani because she's not dead. Oh my god, you're right

1552
02:21:36,740 --> 02:21:40,100
Okay, let me do that. Let me try that. Let me try that. Um

1553
02:21:42,020 --> 02:21:44,020
Is it deceased?

1554
02:21:48,820 --> 02:21:53,380
Is that it no very close though, okay, that's it

1555
02:21:59,140 --> 02:22:02,340
Like green fire candles are they green they green

1556
02:22:03,140 --> 02:22:05,140
Oh

1557
02:22:17,780 --> 02:22:19,780
She's she's still alive

1558
02:22:20,820 --> 02:22:25,540
The thousands tenacity is just something else. What have you done? Why did you heal her?

1559
02:22:27,060 --> 02:22:30,340
He knew I was here with you and fired anyway

1560
02:22:31,300 --> 02:22:36,600
You heard it too, right? He said to stop shooting because they'd hit the book

1561
02:22:37,940 --> 02:22:39,940
Stupid stupid stupid

1562
02:22:40,580 --> 02:22:42,580
It's just me. Are she acting different?

1563
02:22:44,020 --> 02:22:46,260
Thanks for bringing me back or whatever

1564
02:22:47,940 --> 02:22:52,580
Huh, thanks. Did she just say thank you rucksack? What's happening?

1565
02:22:54,900 --> 02:23:00,260
Her desire for buck was what drew her into the woods now that her desire for buck is zero

1566
02:23:00,340 --> 02:23:02,340
There's nothing to amplify. That's all

1567
02:23:03,780 --> 02:23:06,180
Really she's not one of them anymore

1568
02:23:07,620 --> 02:23:11,140
Hey, if I untie you you want to attack me, right?

1569
02:23:12,740 --> 02:23:14,740
No stardust think

1570
02:23:14,980 --> 02:23:19,780
Crisis of faith or not. She's still with the thousand and just tried to kill you

1571
02:23:20,260 --> 02:23:22,740
She literally has your blood on her hands

1572
02:23:25,220 --> 02:23:27,220
I slip I still had the guitar on me

1573
02:23:28,180 --> 02:23:32,740
Oh, it was the it was on her wrist. That's what I used to tie her up there. How's that?

1574
02:23:34,500 --> 02:23:36,500
She whoa, look at the art style

1575
02:23:36,820 --> 02:23:43,220
They look like very different art styles though. I noticed like I know that she's also like 90s art style, but

1576
02:23:44,660 --> 02:23:46,660
She's very I like it

1577
02:23:47,620 --> 02:23:51,540
Very cute very very me. I I like I like it

1578
02:23:54,020 --> 02:23:56,020
Tanned babe

1579
02:23:56,740 --> 02:24:01,620
I'm not gonna say thank you for releasing me too. You're the one you tied me up in the first place

1580
02:24:02,660 --> 02:24:04,660
I'm leaving. Bye

1581
02:24:05,940 --> 02:24:08,820
Stardust we're going to regret this

1582
02:24:09,780 --> 02:24:14,820
Have a little faith in me. It'll be all right. It's funny because the first thing I was like, how do I not sacrifice her?

1583
02:24:15,460 --> 02:24:19,620
And I didn't I forgot I can just heal her. I thought I thought I thought she was straight dead

1584
02:24:20,420 --> 02:24:27,620
Well, I do feel a little better that she's not in here with us anymore

1585
02:24:28,740 --> 02:24:31,060
Not enough being around just fine by me

1586
02:24:33,300 --> 02:24:35,300
Now I can smooch you

1587
02:24:37,060 --> 02:24:39,060
Wait

1588
02:24:42,100 --> 02:24:44,100
Oh

1589
02:24:45,060 --> 02:24:51,620
Okay, that's a part there's still so much

1590
02:24:57,940 --> 02:24:59,940
What am I supposed to do?

1591
02:25:03,300 --> 02:25:07,540
I'm assuming maybe if I eat it if I do everything that they asked

1592
02:25:08,500 --> 02:25:14,900
Like I ate the pot ate them eat the pedal and then she's alive. I can't do the first bones and then yeah

1593
02:25:17,620 --> 02:25:19,620
Okay

1594
02:25:24,100 --> 02:25:26,100
Let's go do it

1595
02:25:26,100 --> 02:25:28,100
So

1596
02:25:42,900 --> 02:25:46,420
Now we gotta go to the kitchen and not get stabbed

1597
02:25:47,460 --> 02:25:50,980
How do I get out of here? Oh, that's the door. The door looks like a freaking mirror

1598
02:25:52,180 --> 02:25:54,180
Bull's flowers on it

1599
02:25:54,580 --> 02:25:56,580
Can I turn can I turn?

1600
02:25:58,500 --> 02:26:06,820
Blood blood gallons of the stuff give them all that they can drink in it will never be enough

1601
02:26:08,340 --> 02:26:10,740
So give them blood blood

1602
02:26:13,460 --> 02:26:17,380
Grab a glass because there's going to be a flood

1603
02:26:24,180 --> 02:26:27,220
Yeah, bitch

1604
02:26:32,260 --> 02:26:34,260

Wait, no, I don't like it this way

1632
02:29:33,060 --> 02:29:37,860
If I get to get a key for it, but if you inspect them, I don't think I want to

02:29:39,540 --> 02:29:46,180
I don't I don't think I need to interrupt their goon sesh. Uh, that's not what I need

02:33:21,060 --> 02:33:23,220
I don't know if they're still around after you do it

1662
02:33:27,140 --> 02:33:29,140
Like I don't know if I just heard it then

1663
02:33:37,700 --> 02:33:42,740
I guess if you sacrifice

1664
02:33:47,460 --> 02:33:49,460
Her

1665
02:33:50,820 --> 02:33:52,820
They will come after you

1666
02:34:03,780 --> 02:34:07,220
Okay, find what they left for you thanks

1667
02:34:08,420 --> 02:34:10,420
Thank you

1668
02:34:14,260 --> 02:34:16,260
Thank you, you're so sweet

1669
02:34:26,100 --> 02:34:28,100
What

1670
02:34:33,620 --> 02:34:35,620
What

1671
02:34:37,860 --> 02:34:39,860
I

1672
02:34:42,740 --> 02:34:44,740
Was I on the wrong page I

1673
02:34:45,700 --> 02:34:48,740
I did it too slow. I couldn't hear over the freaking banging

1674
02:34:49,860 --> 02:34:51,860
If I was doing it too slow or not

1675
02:34:52,420 --> 02:34:55,300
Something is also in my eye. It's bothering the crap out of me

1676
02:34:59,220 --> 02:35:01,220
Great, I gotta do all this shit again

1677
02:35:01,220 --> 02:35:03,220
I

1678
02:35:08,020 --> 02:35:10,020
Can't all right, all right

1679
02:35:31,860 --> 02:35:33,860
I

1680
02:35:46,180 --> 02:35:48,420
Think that was the room they were in before let's see

1681
02:35:58,580 --> 02:36:00,580
I thought they weren't gonna be there

1682
02:36:01,220 --> 02:36:03,220
I

1683
02:36:25,220 --> 02:36:29,780
I feel like there's a glitch because I don't see this page until I get to the hearts which is weird

1684
02:36:31,940 --> 02:36:33,940
I

1685
02:36:43,540 --> 02:36:45,540
Waiting

1686
02:36:49,060 --> 02:36:51,060
My eye

1687
02:36:52,740 --> 02:36:54,740
They go out yet

1688
02:36:55,860 --> 02:37:00,580
It sounds like the baby from PT that's what the baby sounds like

1689
02:37:02,180 --> 02:37:04,180
Oh go away

1690
02:37:08,020 --> 02:37:10,020
No

1691
02:37:11,860 --> 02:37:13,860
I'm busy staring at the hearts

1692
02:37:18,260 --> 02:37:23,940
Black ops zombie noise maybe what the heck is down here are there more places to go

1693
02:37:25,540 --> 02:37:27,540
What

1694
02:37:31,220 --> 02:37:33,220
I

1695
02:38:01,540 --> 02:38:03,540
I

1696
02:38:22,980 --> 02:38:24,980
Oh my god

1697
02:38:25,220 --> 02:38:27,220
Because I couldn't hear like the little

1698
02:38:27,540 --> 02:38:30,820
Noises before so I couldn't tell what like was going on

1699
02:38:35,380 --> 02:38:38,820
Uh cool cool fantastic

1700
02:38:41,940 --> 02:38:43,940
Wait, why will I

1701
02:38:45,620 --> 02:38:47,620
Hold on a moment

1702
02:38:49,220 --> 02:38:52,020
Let me just reread all that because I I

1703
02:38:54,580 --> 02:38:56,580
I missed that

1704
02:38:58,180 --> 02:39:04,260
How wonderful with all this flesh blood flesh blood fresh blood we're as good as home free

1705
02:39:06,180 --> 02:39:12,580
Soon I will finally leave sacramento behind hopefully you two are every hopefully wherever you spend

1706
02:39:15,780 --> 02:39:22,420
Gonna be green patches as well. Yeah. Oh see they forgot there was a glitch they forgot to take her name off

1707
02:39:24,580 --> 02:39:26,580
There's a bug

1708
02:39:28,180 --> 02:39:30,900
Wait, what do you mean remainder of my reality?

1709
02:39:32,980 --> 02:39:38,580
I know this is a lot to take in but because I'm an outer god. Okay, so I remember this part la la la

1710
02:39:40,340 --> 02:39:48,580
Well permanent entities like myself and buck continue to exist between dreams, but as for non immortal. Okay, so buck would live

1711
02:39:50,100 --> 02:39:52,100
Oh, so

1712
02:39:52,500 --> 02:39:55,380
Immortality helps you from not dying when she wakes up

1713
02:39:55,460 --> 02:39:57,460
But where do you where do they exist then

1714
02:39:58,900 --> 02:40:00,900
between dreams

1715
02:40:01,940 --> 02:40:05,460
Stardust a cultist asking the same exact questions once before

1716
02:40:06,900 --> 02:40:10,820
When I gave him my answer at first he laughed as if I was joking

1717
02:40:11,780 --> 02:40:20,500
Shortly after he was disappointed and confused as if oh, what if buck was romancing her and then stole a smooch so he could be immortal

1718
02:40:21,140 --> 02:40:26,980
But then as he began to mull it over it slowly began to drive him mad until finally

1719
02:40:27,620 --> 02:40:31,620
He ran streaking to the woods and never saw me just kidding

1720
02:40:33,300 --> 02:40:35,300
Your answer was really that terrifying

1721
02:40:36,900 --> 02:40:40,100
I've got to know what happens to me once my reality ends

1722
02:40:43,140 --> 02:40:45,140
I don't know

1723
02:40:45,140 --> 02:40:49,540
Someone's coming is it buck did not he spill the beans and see how close we are to finishing?

1724
02:40:50,500 --> 02:40:56,660
I ready my bass guitar. This is it. Whatever happens. I can't fail here for my sake and rock sands. Okay

1725
02:40:59,380 --> 02:41:01,380
I'm ready

1726
02:41:01,620 --> 02:41:03,620
Where's my hand

1727
02:41:06,500 --> 02:41:08,500
I can't

1728
02:41:10,820 --> 02:41:12,820
Uh guys, I don't have a hand

1729
02:41:17,220 --> 02:41:19,220
Okay, I guess I'm just gonna wait

1730
02:41:20,500 --> 02:41:30,820
Well, I thought I have to go outside and bang him over the head

1731
02:41:50,980 --> 02:41:56,340
I'm so sorry

1732
02:42:03,300 --> 02:42:08,100
Ow, what the hell was that for oops hurry get in here

1733
02:42:13,060 --> 02:42:15,060
She's back why

1734
02:42:16,020 --> 02:42:21,620
The one time he reflexes, you know, it's funny because I saw it was her but I hit her anyways

1735
02:42:24,260 --> 02:42:28,820
Because I'm like, oh, it's probably gonna be Naughty coming back. Oh my god, whatever it's smacker

1736
02:42:30,100 --> 02:42:35,620
Because I'm leaving too and the only way I'm getting out of this he out of here is if you finish your rituals

1737
02:42:37,620 --> 02:42:41,700
I gotta get back to my folks and you do too. So my folks are dead

1738
02:42:42,420 --> 02:42:43,540
um

1739
02:42:43,540 --> 02:42:46,740
Actually, thanks to the thousand that's no longer possibility for yeah, see

1740
02:42:48,180 --> 02:42:50,180
Way to rub it in. Oh

1741
02:42:51,860 --> 02:42:54,660
Were they, you know, did we?

1742
02:43:04,020 --> 02:43:10,020
And you saved me anyways, I don't know how I could even begin to thank you

1743
02:43:10,340 --> 02:43:17,540
Well, you can start by helping us escape having an excaltus on our side evens odds greatly

1744
02:43:19,060 --> 02:43:20,820
It does

1745
02:43:20,820 --> 02:43:25,940
Since she has children she has the same superhuman strength as tenacity as the rep wait she has kids

1746
02:43:28,900 --> 02:43:36,180
What what is this kid stuff you're talking about woman, huh? What are you talking about? I do not have kids

1747
02:43:36,180 --> 02:43:38,180
I

1748
02:43:38,420 --> 02:43:43,860
What do you mean you've been buck's girlfriend all this time inside my aura of desire no less

1749
02:43:44,500 --> 02:43:46,500
How haven't the two of you had kids yet?

1750
02:43:47,780 --> 02:43:52,260
Why don't you tell me you're in the space you're the space goat with magic powers or whatever

1751
02:43:52,500 --> 02:43:55,540
How come instead of bring me and bucky closer you ruined everything?

1752
02:44:00,740 --> 02:44:02,740
Is an achievement for not bonking her

1753
02:44:06,740 --> 02:44:11,940
It's fine. I wanted to bunk I also like her face when you bonker

1754
02:44:13,380 --> 02:44:16,260
You seem to seem pretty close before he um shot you

1755
02:44:17,540 --> 02:44:22,180
Well, I mean I guess to be close if I ever got to see him or have any time alone together

1756
02:44:22,340 --> 02:44:25,220
I mean that was what I thought of all this was going to be

1757
02:44:26,980 --> 02:44:31,700
He told me that the black goat of the woods was like some goddess of love or lust or whatever

1758
02:44:32,660 --> 02:44:33,860
So I was like

1759
02:44:33,860 --> 02:44:37,540
Oh, like OMG, that's totally hot. Let's summer right now

1760
02:44:38,500 --> 02:44:42,100
But like as soon as we did he like stopped talking to me

1761
02:44:43,460 --> 02:44:48,340
Between you and all the other girls that wander in a town. It's like I'm invisible or whatever

1762
02:44:49,700 --> 02:44:52,580
I said explains why not he thought I was here for a buck when we ran into each other

1763
02:44:53,860 --> 02:44:57,060
For a second back there when I thought he realized how much I meant to him

1764
02:44:58,020 --> 02:45:02,260
Back when he said that you can keep the book and the god if he just got me back

1765
02:45:03,300 --> 02:45:05,300
But I guess I'm like

1766
02:45:05,940 --> 02:45:12,260
Hey, don't get yourself down. There's plenty of other violent cult leaders out there. I'm sure you'll find the right one for you

1767
02:45:13,940 --> 02:45:19,940
Thanks, but I think I'm swearing off skulls and robes for a while after we do these rituals that is

1768
02:45:20,340 --> 02:45:22,340
Is

1769
02:45:22,900 --> 02:45:24,900
Have a bow on it

1770
02:45:25,140 --> 02:45:29,540
Flower that's cute. Here's everything you need for the next one. Save you the trip. Oh, thank god

1771
02:45:30,580 --> 02:45:32,980
Really to think she was returning just to help me

1772
02:45:34,820 --> 02:45:37,620
So after this reality will end eventually

1773
02:45:39,780 --> 02:45:41,780
Yes

1774
02:45:42,340 --> 02:45:45,300
I'm part of this dream meaning I'll probably vanish too

1775
02:45:47,860 --> 02:45:49,860
Most likely

1776
02:45:50,740 --> 02:45:53,060
So that makes me your dream girl

1777
02:45:54,500 --> 02:45:59,860
Well, that's one tick. Oh, here he did this. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh, cool

1778
02:46:03,140 --> 02:46:06,580
Cool indeed, but it's about to get very very very hot

1779
02:46:13,140 --> 02:46:15,140
I'm seeing if there's any do stuff

1780
02:46:15,700 --> 02:46:23,780
You're never gonna make it out anyways the thousand are ready to die for buck the mob us as soon as this place starts burning

1781
02:46:24,980 --> 02:46:28,740
Here if you take my old robes and mask you can like slip right past them

1782
02:46:28,980 --> 02:46:33,220
I'll stay behind and make sure the book burns. Oh, so she sacrifices herself for us

1783
02:46:33,860 --> 02:46:35,860
And she take your scrunchie back

1784
02:46:37,460 --> 02:46:38,740
Oh

1785
02:46:38,740 --> 02:46:40,740
I wish I saved you at the beginning

1786
02:46:41,380 --> 02:46:44,100
You're a real one girly pop a boop your nose boop

1787
02:46:45,300 --> 02:46:48,900
But what about you won't they kill you if they see you without your cult stuff?

1788
02:46:50,340 --> 02:46:53,860
As if they know my face if they see me running away, they'll let me go

1789
02:46:55,060 --> 02:46:57,060
Here try this on

1790
02:46:58,020 --> 02:47:02,020
I slip on the rose and tuck my head into the skulls goat skull mask if it's snugly

1791
02:47:03,620 --> 02:47:06,740
It fits. Do you know what that means? It means you sit

1792
02:47:08,180 --> 02:47:10,180
The disguise will work

1793
02:47:11,140 --> 02:47:14,500
Well, yeah, but more importantly it means are the same size

1794
02:47:15,460 --> 02:47:18,420
I regret but no, I don't regret bonking her the face was cute

1795
02:47:19,940 --> 02:47:25,220
Can I like totally raid your closet on my way out because like I didn't want to say this while we were trying to kill each other

1796
02:47:25,220 --> 02:47:28,820
Anything, but I love your pastel goth look stuff. Yeah. Oh

1797
02:47:29,540 --> 02:47:32,500
Yeah, take whatever you want. It's all burning to the ground anyways

1798
02:47:33,220 --> 02:47:36,500
But so weird though like she can't remember anything

1799
02:47:37,380 --> 02:47:40,180
Is like is that her stuff like I don't know if this is really her house

1800
02:47:42,180 --> 02:47:43,780
Awesome

1801
02:47:43,780 --> 02:47:45,140
Stardust no

1802
02:47:45,140 --> 02:47:52,100
We're so close to escaping you can't throw it all away now by trusting her if the book doesn't burn all this will be for nothing

1803
02:47:53,700 --> 02:47:59,300
If you trust her and then she hands the book over to the thousand both of us are going to pay for it

1804
02:47:59,860 --> 02:48:01,940
She already switched sides once today

1805
02:48:03,380 --> 02:48:05,380
I got us this far didn't I?

1806
02:48:05,380 --> 02:48:07,380
You don't let you down now

1807
02:48:07,940 --> 02:48:09,460
But she

1808
02:48:09,460 --> 02:48:10,420
Uh

1809
02:48:10,420 --> 02:48:15,540
All right, I I just want this so badly. I don't know if I have any hearts left to break

1810
02:48:17,300 --> 02:48:19,620
Oh, look at all our broken hearts. Oh

1811
02:48:21,860 --> 02:48:24,580
Come on, let's head on down to the root room and finish this

1812
02:48:28,820 --> 02:48:30,820
Okay

1813
02:48:31,300 --> 02:48:33,220
Yeah

1814
02:48:33,220 --> 02:48:36,660
Turn so slowly. Oh, look at you. You look so cute when I spit

1815
02:48:43,380 --> 02:48:45,960
They're gonna be dudes I can't remember if there are dudes down here

1816
02:49:04,180 --> 02:49:06,180
Oh

1817
02:49:11,780 --> 02:49:17,780
Wait, you want to end up with nani? No, I'm good. I want to end up with a goat mama. I still want her

1818
02:49:17,780 --> 02:49:19,780
I

1819
02:49:31,700 --> 02:49:34,740
Blood rop loom accelerant, but uh

1820
02:49:39,860 --> 02:49:43,300
You actually did it you really actually did it

1821
02:49:44,180 --> 02:49:47,300
And so the blackwoods have been destroyed blah blah blah blah

1822
02:49:48,500 --> 02:49:50,500
There she goes like an oven in here

1823
02:49:51,620 --> 02:49:53,620
Toss me the book

1824
02:49:53,700 --> 02:49:59,300
Look down at the purple ritual book hearing rock stands where he's echo one more time through my head. I know what I'm doing

1825
02:50:00,580 --> 02:50:02,340
ha ha

1826
02:50:02,340 --> 02:50:04,180
Here, sorry

1827
02:50:04,180 --> 02:50:08,580
Here ha ha ha. I didn't imagine that I ending with me willing hitting the book over to you

1828
02:50:09,220 --> 02:50:11,940
Oh my god, right? Totally not what I expected at all

1829
02:50:13,620 --> 02:50:19,540
You know buck really wants this book and now that the woods are all burning down. He'd probably give anything to have it back

1830
02:50:21,860 --> 02:50:24,900
If we went back to the thousand together we could just ask for anything

1831
02:50:24,980 --> 02:50:26,980
I'm sure he'd let you join

1832
02:50:26,980 --> 02:50:28,980
I can squirt her if I want

1833
02:50:30,740 --> 02:50:33,620
And now that me and buck are through I totally go out with you

1834
02:50:36,980 --> 02:50:38,980
Oh, I can't date her

1835
02:50:39,700 --> 02:50:41,700
Nani we have to burn the book

1836
02:50:42,420 --> 02:50:45,140
You sure one last chance to go with me

1837
02:50:46,900 --> 02:50:48,420
Nani

1838
02:50:48,420 --> 02:50:51,620
kidding kidding. I was just kidding. James mostly

1839
02:50:52,900 --> 02:50:56,980
You want to like you want to just like, you know, so sorry you want to like, you know

1840
02:50:57,700 --> 02:51:01,300
Something we can you know hit up that other, you know the goat girlie, you know

1841
02:51:02,740 --> 02:51:05,220
She takes a long look at the book before tossing into the fire

1842
02:51:05,700 --> 02:51:13,060
Hey, this is like so embarrassing to say, but I think we would have been besties. The things have been different or whatever

1843
02:51:13,620 --> 02:51:16,500
You know, like besties that like kiss a lot. You're so cute

1844
02:51:17,700 --> 02:51:19,220
See ya

1845
02:51:19,220 --> 02:51:22,340
Her smile is really pretty. I wish we could have met somewhere else too

1846
02:51:23,540 --> 02:51:26,020
Time to go. Hopefully the sky is enough to escape

1847
02:51:28,020 --> 02:51:30,020
Oh, I actually have to escape

1848
02:51:30,100 --> 02:51:32,100
Oh

1849
02:51:33,780 --> 02:51:35,780
My god

1850
02:51:40,340 --> 02:51:42,340
Nani is that you

1851
02:51:42,900 --> 02:51:46,740
Shoot, I wasn't expecting to have to talk my way. Why do they look so weirdly drawn?

1852
02:51:47,940 --> 02:51:49,940
Yeah, um totally

1853
02:51:51,540 --> 02:51:56,660
It is her. What are you still doing in here? The place is coming down. Do I really have all of them fooled?

1854
02:51:57,620 --> 02:52:02,820
Damn it that outsider must have completed the upper ritual if you rush her you might be able to save the book

1855
02:52:04,100 --> 02:52:05,060
Right

1856
02:52:05,060 --> 02:52:07,780
There's no way the book is burned all the way yet. I need to buy nani's more time

1857
02:52:09,220 --> 02:52:12,340
Wait, I'll like totally get the book myself or whatever

1858
02:52:14,420 --> 02:52:15,620
Really?

1859
02:52:15,620 --> 02:52:17,220
Nani you're amazing

1860
02:52:17,220 --> 02:52:19,220
You're a true believer

1861
02:52:19,220 --> 02:52:24,180
I can't believe you sacrifice yourself for all of us. Come on guys. Let's get out of here. Right

1862
02:52:25,140 --> 02:52:27,140
Morons, okay, cool

1863
02:52:31,940 --> 02:52:34,500
Let's just go I wonder if they'll be fire. I have to dodge

1864
02:52:36,580 --> 02:52:38,580
What

1865
02:52:46,020 --> 02:52:48,020
Where am I going

1866
02:52:54,260 --> 02:52:57,780
There's like water right there. I can just probably jump in the water. Oh

1867
02:53:00,020 --> 02:53:02,020
Hey, what does that say?

1868
02:53:07,140 --> 02:53:09,140
Ah

1869
02:53:11,460 --> 02:53:15,220
No, wait, go back. It doesn't matter just get the fuck out

1870
02:53:15,780 --> 02:53:17,780
I

1871
02:53:23,300 --> 02:53:25,300
Other paper towels just chill in there

1872
02:53:27,300 --> 02:53:29,300
Ah

1873
02:53:30,020 --> 02:53:32,020
The handle is probably so hot

1874
02:53:33,380 --> 02:53:38,340
I made it I survived the night just kidding buck is probably gonna shoot me. Oh shit

1875
02:53:39,700 --> 02:53:43,540
I've got a lot to a to go for I'm clear of the wildfire, but I'm ahead of it for the moment

1876
02:53:44,180 --> 02:53:47,860
Better be sure that this is the robin mask. I don't want to be mistaken for a cultist on some home free

1877
02:53:48,420 --> 02:53:51,700
I lower my mask only as I watch my childhood home burn to the ground

1878
02:53:53,620 --> 02:53:55,300
Is that why they tanned nani?

1879
02:53:55,300 --> 02:53:59,940
I just realized that because I'm like, wouldn't they be able to tell them apart with like the hair and stuff?

1880
02:53:59,940 --> 02:54:01,940
Or maybe they put the wood the foot on

1881
02:54:03,780 --> 02:54:07,060
The house crackles out as the wind foundation splinters

1882
02:54:07,700 --> 02:54:12,340
Large sections of the house begin coming down in cinders bring any cultists unfortunate to have been trapped underneath

1883
02:54:13,300 --> 02:54:17,940
This should be the end of the experiences. Wait, what's that? Is that freaking buck?

1884
02:54:25,940 --> 02:54:27,940
Oh my god

1885
02:54:31,460 --> 02:54:33,460
No, you bitch

1886
02:54:38,500 --> 02:54:42,020
Wait, did she did she wait she's like I ended up not giving the book back

1887
02:54:42,980 --> 02:54:46,100
Wait, wait, was that her? Was that nani's boy? I don't know

1888
02:54:53,940 --> 02:55:00,180
Oh nani has left a thousand I wonder if I can like recruit people true and let's go

1889
02:55:02,260 --> 02:55:04,260
Yeah, the second and third chapters are already out

1890
02:55:06,900 --> 02:55:11,220
Oh, hold on. I want to see I don't know if I have it it in me because I'm in a lot of pain

1891
02:55:11,700 --> 02:55:13,700
Um, yeah, I'm gonna end it here

1892
02:55:14,180 --> 02:55:16,180
It is really cute. I really like it

1893
02:55:18,500 --> 02:55:22,980
All uh, don't worry after my fps week next week. I'll bring I'll bring

1894
02:55:23,940 --> 02:55:26,500
I'll put suckers for love sucker for love back on there

1895
02:55:30,500 --> 02:55:34,200
I want to I want to see what the checkpoints look like

1896
02:55:41,380 --> 02:55:44,280
Okay, then there's there's it's always two choices

1897
02:55:47,940 --> 02:55:55,460
Cool cool cool looking forward to the next chapter. Yeah, oh everything's gone

1898
02:55:57,860 --> 02:55:59,860
Everything's gone

1899
02:56:00,740 --> 02:56:02,740

But I hope you guys enjoy we're gonna find something to raid

1904
02:56:34,820 --> 02:56:36,820
That was really fun actually

1905
02:56:36,900 --> 02:56:42,900
I was I was spookier than I thought it would be but it's fitting for the summer we

02:56:48,020 --> 02:56:50,420

1907
02:56:52,100 --> 02:56:55,620

Hand cam stream or I'm gonna read you tarot and make spell jars the tarot will be

1912
02:57:13,780 --> 02:57:17,540
Uh, I'm I'm probably gonna do like five bucks and I'll read it for you

1913
02:57:18,340 --> 02:57:20,340
um

1914
02:57:20,500 --> 02:57:22,500
Just because it can be

1915
02:57:22,580 --> 02:57:26,180
Sometimes people just kind of overwhelm me with requests and questions. So if you really want it

1916
02:57:27,300 --> 02:57:31,380
Bring your lunch money. Bring your five dollar and I'll I'll read your tarot

1917
02:57:31,460 --> 02:57:35,460
Hey, it's better than some like some lady at a rent fair that asks for 40 bucks. Okay

1918
02:57:36,900 --> 02:57:41,540
All right, that happened to me once I went to a rent fair and I was like, you know

1919
02:57:41,540 --> 02:57:46,740
I've never gotten like a reading from someone else. So let me get a reading from someone else. I sat there

1920
02:57:47,460 --> 02:57:51,700
You know dressed up real cute in my little fairy costume because of course I dressed up

1921
02:57:53,220 --> 02:57:54,740
And

1922
02:57:54,740 --> 02:57:57,060
She's like that'll be 40 dollars and I'm like what?

1923
02:57:58,660 --> 02:58:00,660
Jesus christ, all right

1924
02:58:00,820 --> 02:58:02,820
and um

1925
02:58:02,820 --> 02:58:07,860
Gavor it and then she pulls cards in mind you again. I can read cards. She's like

1926
02:58:08,900 --> 02:58:12,580
Someone's recently passed away and like really typical stuff

1927
02:58:12,980 --> 02:58:18,020
Someone's recently passed away in your life and they're reaching out to you from the other side

1928
02:58:18,660 --> 02:58:20,660
Is this correct and I'm like, no

1929
02:58:22,740 --> 02:58:24,580
No one

1930
02:58:24,580 --> 02:58:26,980
Not going in my immediate family has died

1931
02:58:28,100 --> 02:58:30,100
My family is fine

1932
02:58:30,660 --> 02:58:34,820
I'm like my cat died three years ago. She's like it's that and I'm like, bitch. Don't even

1933
02:58:38,020 --> 02:58:41,540
Don't even don't even with me lady

1934
02:58:45,140 --> 02:58:48,100
And then I'm just like I'm then I'm looking at the cards and I'm like

1935
02:58:49,620 --> 02:58:52,420
I'm like I just wanted a general reading and so like while she's talking

1936
02:58:52,420 --> 02:58:56,580
I'm just zoning out and I'm just looking at the cards that she pulled and then I'm looking to myself and I'm like

1937
02:58:57,940 --> 02:59:00,340
None of this means shit. I just wasted 40 bucks. I should probably just leave

1938
02:59:00,820 --> 02:59:06,340
So she's like, thank you. And if you feel want to leave a tip and I'm just like, yeah, and then I just walked away

1939
02:59:07,700 --> 02:59:09,700
I was like, no

1940
02:59:09,700 --> 02:59:13,940
I also make a spell jar. I have stuff to make spell jars. I already have I've had to make stuff to make spell jars

1941
02:59:14,340 --> 02:59:16,660
I'll do um some sort of like

1942
02:59:17,860 --> 02:59:19,860
relaxation

1943
02:59:19,940 --> 02:59:21,300
spell jar

1944
02:59:21,300 --> 02:59:23,300
Probably for us. I'm like calming

1945
02:59:24,100 --> 02:59:26,100
like good vibe spell jar

1946
02:59:27,700 --> 02:59:29,460
I'm feeling that

1947
02:59:29,460 --> 02:59:33,380
But uh, I'm gonna I need to get my my nails done tomorrow

1948
02:59:34,260 --> 02:59:36,820
I'm gonna get my nails. I think I'm gonna do black

1949
02:59:39,220 --> 02:59:44,980
I think I'm gonna do black I might get like I'm tempted to get like the stiletto like super sharp pointy nails

1950
02:59:45,220 --> 02:59:47,220
But I don't think I will. I think I'll just get like

1951
02:59:48,740 --> 02:59:51,940
Coffin perhaps I think coffin shaped nails would be cute

1952
02:59:52,900 --> 02:59:54,900
It's a little early

1953
02:59:55,700 --> 02:59:57,140
But you know, I'll be honest with you

1954
02:59:57,140 --> 03:00:03,620
I really don't like red nail polish on me because because like red's just not my color. It just clashes with my skin tone

1955
03:00:04,660 --> 03:00:06,260
um

1956
03:00:06,260 --> 03:00:07,860
I'll tell you that

1957
03:00:07,860 --> 03:00:13,460
Just like unless it's a if it's a deep red it looks good if it's like maroon, then it looks fine

1958
03:00:13,460 --> 03:00:15,460
but if it's like a bright red

1959
03:00:15,540 --> 03:00:16,820
like my

1960
03:00:16,820 --> 03:00:18,820
normal like my my

1961
03:00:19,300 --> 03:00:21,300
Model's nails it kind of looks funny

1962
03:00:22,260 --> 03:00:25,780
Uh, but yeah, so that'll be fun tomorrow. Let's see

1963
03:00:25,780 --> 03:00:27,780
Oh

1964
03:00:49,780 --> 03:00:53,780
Conn is playing black myth wukong. I'm debating whether or not to get black myth wukong

1965
03:00:55,860 --> 03:00:57,860
I'm gonna I'm gonna um

1966
03:01:01,940 --> 03:01:08,180
It means doing a t-shirt painting stream, which looks really cool. So I'm just gonna I'm being held at gunpoint by my mom

1967
03:01:09,380 --> 03:01:13,620
What and I took up for I we we we I took uh, I took

1969
03:01:25,780 --> 03:01:27,780

Hold on I can't really see the chat that well my resize stuff

1971
03:01:42,900 --> 03:01:48,100
And this chat looks is really dumb to read what FPS will I play next week?

03:01:50,820 --> 03:01:52,820
I'll have you you can guess

1973

1985
03:02:38,340 --> 03:02:42,020
In a week I've been in the mood for I was gonna do destiny, but I'm like now I won't put people through that

1986
03:02:43,060 --> 03:02:46,420
Because I would just be playing multiplayer. I would just really just playing the crucible the entire time

1987
03:02:47,220 --> 03:02:49,220
Whatever the frick it's called now

1988
03:02:52,980 --> 03:02:54,980
Where's the schedule

1989
03:02:56,980 --> 03:03:00,740
So you guys get a little no left for dead. I'm not playing left for dead

1990
03:03:02,180 --> 03:03:03,620
Um

1991
03:03:03,620 --> 03:03:05,620
So we got

1992
03:03:05,620 --> 03:03:07,620
I'll tell you I'll tell you the schedule

1993
03:03:08,420 --> 03:03:10,420
So monday

1994
03:03:10,500 --> 03:03:15,460
I'm gonna be playing gargic phone with you guys if you're a member if you're a member and you want to play gargic phone with me

1995
03:03:16,820 --> 03:03:20,420
Um, and we'll like how play people swap out and stuff

1996
03:03:22,260 --> 03:03:24,260
Then I think that'd be fun

1997
03:03:24,900 --> 03:03:26,900
You know

1998
03:03:27,860 --> 03:03:29,860
You know I wanted

1999
03:03:31,700 --> 03:03:33,540
Get in the robot

2000
03:03:33,540 --> 03:03:37,060
League arc was she being I I don't know how to play league

2001
03:03:37,060 --> 03:03:41,540
I've never played league in my entire life and I will never touch league in my entire life

2002
03:03:42,180 --> 03:03:44,180
No, thanks. Um

2003
03:03:45,940 --> 03:03:48,740
Uh the and that's at 6 p.m. Because

2004
03:03:49,300 --> 03:03:54,260
Stroni likes to take up the entire day on monday, although it's only me and her streaming

2005
03:04:00,020 --> 03:04:03,300
We have we're hanging out. Uh, yeah, she has

2006
03:04:04,660 --> 03:04:09,460
She's with like a personality stream and then a member walked along and then I think I might do

2007
03:04:10,020 --> 03:04:13,860
A member thing and then till like maybe like 11 p.m. Play like elden ring

2008
03:04:14,900 --> 03:04:16,180
Um

2009
03:04:16,180 --> 03:04:20,020
I don't know or whatever you guys want me to play. Um after the member stream

2010
03:04:20,020 --> 03:04:22,820
I'll probably do some sort of gorilla if I feel like it if I'm up for it

2011
03:04:23,220 --> 03:04:26,580
Uh tuesday 4 p.m. Titanfall 2

2012
03:04:30,340 --> 03:04:32,340
Um

2013
03:04:35,060 --> 03:04:37,060
But it's her birthday

2014
03:04:37,700 --> 03:04:39,540
It

2015
03:04:39,540 --> 03:04:43,380
That's trust me for Azura's birthday. She doesn't want to play league with me

2016
03:04:44,260 --> 03:04:46,260
I could I could assure you of that

2017
03:04:46,980 --> 03:04:48,820
um

2018
03:04:48,820 --> 03:04:50,820
Wednesday 28th

2019
03:04:54,900 --> 03:04:58,260
Do maternal baby you playing do maternal I saw it was on sale

2020
03:04:58,740 --> 03:05:01,300
This is what it was. I was really looking. I'm like, what should I do next week?

2021
03:05:01,460 --> 03:05:07,060
Because normally I have my schedule done by wednesday so so my um manager can make all my thumbnails

2022
03:05:07,860 --> 03:05:10,660
And so I saw it was on sale for like seven bucks

2023
03:05:11,540 --> 03:05:13,540
And I'm like

2024
03:05:14,980 --> 03:05:18,580
Yeah, yeah, we're doing that. Yeah, we're playing doom eternal

2025
03:05:19,140 --> 03:05:23,700
And I'll be honest with you. I've never touched a doom game in my life either. This will be my doom virginity being taken

2026
03:05:23,700 --> 03:05:27,300
I've never played the original dooms. I want to play the original dooms. Um

2027
03:05:28,260 --> 03:05:30,420
But I think I would just start off with something like

2028
03:05:32,900 --> 03:05:34,020
Hmm

2029
03:05:34,020 --> 03:05:37,060
Although what year did doom eternal come out like I don't know how many years ago

2030
03:05:37,220 --> 03:05:41,620
But then like then I'll go play maybe I'll have like a retro week. Well, I'll play like a bunch of retro games

2031
03:05:42,820 --> 03:05:44,340
um

2032
03:05:44,340 --> 03:05:48,100
And then so that'll doom eternal be wednesday 4 p.m

2033
03:05:52,020 --> 03:05:53,780
Thursday

2034
03:05:53,780 --> 03:05:58,340
6 p.m. Don't worry emmy's not streaming in that slot. She's doing something else that day at a different time

2035
03:05:58,900 --> 03:06:04,500
Uh, she has some sort of collab with people. I'm not going to spoil it though because that's her schedule that she will talk about

2036
03:06:05,060 --> 03:06:06,660
um

2037
03:06:06,660 --> 03:06:07,860
Thursday

2038
03:06:07,860 --> 03:06:09,860
29th 6 p.m

2039
03:06:10,180 --> 03:06:12,180
fallout new vegas, baby

2040
03:06:13,300 --> 03:06:15,300
fallout new vegas, baby

2041
03:06:16,020 --> 03:06:18,020
I've never played a fallout game

2042
03:06:19,620 --> 03:06:25,940
I've never played a fallout game in my life. It looks like what's that like that free switch game fallout shelter

2043
03:06:28,260 --> 03:06:29,940
Um

2044
03:06:29,940 --> 03:06:34,980
I also wanted to play doom eternal because that doom the dark ages looked so good to me when I saw the trailer

2045
03:06:35,860 --> 03:06:37,380
uh

2046
03:06:37,380 --> 03:06:40,500
Lots of bangers indeed. So fallout new vegas, uh

2047
03:06:42,420 --> 03:06:46,180
And then friday, I already had planned something with niana banana

2048
03:06:46,980 --> 03:06:52,340
We're gonna do two cat girls bully you asmr and i'm gonna kind of teach you how to do asmr. I'll try to do it

2049
03:06:53,060 --> 03:06:54,580
better

2050
03:06:54,580 --> 03:06:56,580
than what I did

2051
03:06:57,220 --> 03:06:58,580
for

2052
03:06:58,580 --> 03:07:02,740
Potas parasi and actually try to teach niana stuff

2053
03:07:03,380 --> 03:07:04,340
um

2054
03:07:04,340 --> 03:07:07,940
Hopefully new vegas doesn't crap itself. Perhaps. I have backups just in case

2055
03:07:08,580 --> 03:07:09,780
um

2056
03:07:09,780 --> 03:07:11,780
saturday

2057
03:07:12,100 --> 03:07:14,100
31st

2058
03:07:14,420 --> 03:07:16,420
4 p.m

2059
03:07:17,220 --> 03:07:21,060
Borderlands we're playing borderlands. It's funny. I've never played borderlands

2060
03:07:21,700 --> 03:07:23,460
And mind you I've had

2061
03:07:23,460 --> 03:07:25,620
fallout new vegas and borderlands on my

2062
03:07:26,580 --> 03:07:28,900
On my pc for years and I've never touched them

2063
03:07:29,860 --> 03:07:35,460
Uh doom eternal I just bought today titan fall. I've had for I actually um played through uh recently

2064
03:07:35,540 --> 03:07:37,540
So I shouldn't be too dog shit at it

2065
03:07:39,140 --> 03:07:44,740
Um, this is all preparation for october 26 when although it's you know

2066
03:07:46,180 --> 03:07:48,180
Over a month away

2067
03:07:48,900 --> 03:07:54,500
A little over a month away for black ops 6. Uh, I haven't played the last I I usually only I only

2068
03:07:54,900 --> 03:07:58,580
Really have played call of duty more to warfare. I haven't played any of the black ops games

2069
03:07:58,740 --> 03:08:02,260
I remember watching my dad play a lot of black ops and like zombies and stuff with his friends

2070
03:08:02,420 --> 03:08:07,780
But I wasn't really allowed to play fps shooters until I was able to be smart enough to play them in secret

2071
03:08:08,340 --> 03:08:10,340
Um, because my dad said they were too violent for me

2072
03:08:11,940 --> 03:08:13,940
He wasn't wrong

2073
03:08:14,020 --> 03:08:17,300
I didn't yeah, I didn't I didn't touch like cs go until I was like 16

2074
03:08:18,100 --> 03:08:19,300
um

2075
03:08:19,300 --> 03:08:24,260
A borderlands one I do have borderlands two if you guys have a preference

2076
03:08:26,020 --> 03:08:30,180
Been feeling a sheep. Don't say that don't that's not nice. Um

2077
03:08:31,380 --> 03:08:34,580
I have borderlands one and two so if you have a preference

2078
03:08:35,140 --> 03:08:36,740
probably two

2079
03:08:36,740 --> 03:08:38,580
one is the og

2080
03:08:38,580 --> 03:08:43,060
For okay, everybody's really saying two one is out. Okay, then I'll I'll change it to borderlands two then

2081
03:08:43,540 --> 03:08:45,540
Uh, let me do that right now

2082
03:08:46,580 --> 03:08:48,580
borderlands two

2083
03:08:48,900 --> 03:08:52,340
I think do I have like the game of the year edition or something? Let me look

2084
03:09:03,220 --> 03:09:08,260
Oh, no, I have the game of the year edition enhanced for the regular version for the first one

2085
03:09:09,140 --> 03:09:11,140
All right, we'll do borderlands two

2086
03:09:13,140 --> 03:09:15,140
Especially because the movie just came out

2087
03:09:16,100 --> 03:09:18,100
Excuse me, but yeah

2088
03:09:19,460 --> 03:09:21,460
That's that

2089
03:09:22,020 --> 03:09:24,260
Borderlands three I never bought borderlands three so

2090
03:09:25,380 --> 03:09:30,580
I never I never never ended up buying it. Um, all right, so I'll send you guys on over to emmy

2091
03:09:31,300 --> 03:09:35,780
Uh, I heard the movie. I heard the movie sucks too. Yeah, that's why I'm like, you know what?

2092
03:09:35,780 --> 03:09:38,820
Let me play the game so I can if I ever like

2093
03:09:39,540 --> 03:09:44,740
See the movie when it comes out on DVD and I told they watch it in a member's watch along

2094
03:09:45,220 --> 03:09:47,620
If like I can be angry like everybody else

2095
03:09:49,460 --> 03:09:54,340
That movie sure does exist. Just kidding. No, I never do make us do that in a watch home. Um

2096
03:09:55,140 --> 03:09:57,780
But yeah, sucker for love is really good. I hope you guys enjoyed

2097
03:09:58,180 --> 03:10:00,180
Uh, you can see madam the doom armor

2098
03:10:01,620 --> 03:10:03,620
We'll see how bad I am in fps is

2099
03:10:03,700 --> 03:10:06,820
Uh, I used to be pretty nasty at them. I have I've been kind of out of touch

2100
03:10:06,980 --> 03:10:10,500
I haven't played an fps since I played valorant with nori

2101
03:10:11,860 --> 03:10:13,860
Last october

2102
03:10:15,460 --> 03:10:21,220
I was a long time ago. That was the first time me and nori ever hung out and the first thing we did we played valorant together

2103
03:10:21,940 --> 03:10:23,940
And we were just toxic the entire time

2104
03:10:24,420 --> 03:10:26,260
um

2105
03:10:26,260 --> 03:10:28,900
I actually used to like valo. I used to like valo a lot

2106
03:10:29,780 --> 03:10:32,500
Um, because it reminded me so much of csgo

2107
03:10:33,540 --> 03:10:35,540
and I liked again, I liked the

2108
03:10:38,260 --> 03:10:40,900
What like kind of sweatiness of csgo

2109
03:10:41,140 --> 03:10:46,100
But not as sweaty as like see like rainbow six siege because I don't like rainbow six

2110
03:10:46,740 --> 03:10:50,500
I'll I'll never I'll never play siege. I played that once with like

2111
03:10:51,780 --> 03:10:53,380
uh prominent

2112
03:10:53,380 --> 03:10:55,380
youtuber friend of mine

2113
03:10:56,100 --> 03:10:57,540
and

2114
03:10:57,540 --> 03:11:00,740
The mind you this was this was years and years and years ago. This was like

2115
03:11:02,340 --> 03:11:06,100
Yeah, this was years ago and they were so toxic. I never touched the game again

2116
03:11:06,260 --> 03:11:09,940
I was like, I do I never want to play if people are like this. This is horrible

2117
03:11:11,220 --> 03:11:18,020
Um valorant is bad as like I like valorant. I like casual valorant casual games. That's fine casual cs. That was fine to me

2118
03:11:19,380 --> 03:11:21,380
um

2119
03:11:23,540 --> 03:11:25,700
Yeah, it really sucked because I like

2120
03:11:26,660 --> 03:11:32,660
I like I like it's really hard being told that you're so dog shit at a game when you just started

2121
03:11:33,540 --> 03:11:35,860
And this person is streaming to a lot of people

2122
03:11:36,820 --> 03:11:42,180
And they're just shitting on you and I'm like, ah, well one I've never talked to you again because you're a horrible human being too

2123
03:11:42,260 --> 03:11:44,580
I'm never playing this game again. Thanks for ruining it for me

2124
03:11:45,220 --> 03:11:46,260
um

2125
03:11:46,260 --> 03:11:50,020
But it's funny because I want I used to want to be a competitive cs player

2126
03:11:50,020 --> 03:11:53,620
Like I really wanted to be a competitive csgo player. I wanted to be the first

2127
03:11:54,260 --> 03:12:02,100
POC female competitive cs but that probably that title is long gone. Um, but it was it was a goal of mine

2128
03:12:02,900 --> 03:12:04,900
I was never that good by the way

2129
03:12:05,780 --> 03:12:07,780
Never like I was never

2130
03:12:09,220 --> 03:12:11,140
I couldn't get past like

2131
03:12:11,140 --> 03:12:13,140
gold

2132
03:12:13,140 --> 03:12:14,260
valorant

2133
03:12:14,260 --> 03:12:18,660
I was never like platinum diamond. Whatever the fuck. No

2134
03:12:20,500 --> 03:12:22,500
Same with same with apex

2135
03:12:24,260 --> 03:12:26,260
All my homies hate apex by the way

2136
03:12:28,020 --> 03:12:30,820
Um, I'm never I'm not really good if I used to play fighting games

2137
03:12:30,900 --> 03:12:35,140
Like when my dad would bring me to like an arcade, but otherwise I never like played like

2138
03:12:36,420 --> 03:12:38,420
Fightems fighting games

2139
03:12:39,940 --> 03:12:41,940
I because I would just I'm not like

2140
03:12:42,660 --> 03:12:46,580
When it when it comes to fighting games, I'm not super smart about them. I just button mash

2141
03:12:48,100 --> 03:12:49,300
like

2142
03:12:49,300 --> 03:12:50,900
even with like

2143
03:12:50,900 --> 03:12:55,620
Yeah, even with I'm just like so annoying to play with for a fighting game because I just like

2144
03:12:56,580 --> 03:13:01,300
Exploit a weakness within the fighting or like just one move and I'll just spam it like I do Eldenry

2145
03:13:02,100 --> 03:13:04,100
Like so when I play like super smash bros

2146

03:14:10,420 --> 03:14:12,580
Niana when we stream together

2165
03:14:12,980 --> 03:14:20,260
I played with her and my pl and a bunch of other girls and they were so sick of me because I kept winning every

2166
03:14:21,060 --> 03:14:25,060
Re-king game and I started throwing because I felt bad

2167
03:14:30,020 --> 03:14:32,580
So I just started throwing because I felt bad

2168
03:14:32,660 --> 03:14:34,660
I

2169
03:14:34,980 --> 03:14:37,140

My turn mario carvers chat

2176
03:15:09,060 --> 03:15:15,380

2177
03:15:17,300 --> 03:15:22,020
Then I started getting like I was like coming in third and I was like dammit because these like those people that were like

2178
03:15:22,100 --> 03:15:24,100
No, life in it

03:15:29,060 --> 03:15:30,900
No males allowed

2181
03:15:30,900 --> 03:15:32,900

2182
03:15:33,700 --> 03:15:36,580
How did it flush the toilet after taking a shit?

2183
03:15:38,260 --> 03:15:40,260
Where it was one of us

2184
03:15:41,940 --> 03:15:45,620
A bit of topic but if a vtuber streamer suggests some sort of event competition

2185
03:15:45,620 --> 03:15:49,140
Are we allowed to suggest to the viewer livers, especially if it looks like something one of them? Of course

2186
03:15:50,020 --> 03:15:54,020
Of course you can um, but again, we have to be invited to those things

2187
03:15:55,540 --> 03:15:58,180
Like we can't just be like yeah, we're in like

2188
03:15:58,660 --> 03:16:01,220
People usually will reach out to our management team

Is our treat just gets the amount of r34 search what?

2195
03:16:23,540 --> 03:16:29,620
I'm actually really good at number guessing, but yeah, so and also like probably have to get perms for that sort of stuff

2196
03:16:31,380 --> 03:16:37,140
Managers talking to managers face to face shit. Yeah, but it's it's also just like, you know nuance

2197
03:16:39,300 --> 03:16:41,300
Vtuber community stuff

2202
03:16:57,940 --> 03:16:59,940
Um

2203
03:17:00,020 --> 03:17:06,500
Yeah fans getting people aware that's about it. Yeah, but you also don't want like people like fans like crying about stuff and like being like hey

2204
03:17:08,260 --> 03:17:10,020
Hey

2206
03:17:13,140 --> 03:17:18,740
By extent of you or like hate the fans and that's whatever don't worry about it

2207
03:17:19,060 --> 03:17:27,060
Don't worry about it cyber slime bunny girl dominatrix. I accidentally ripped a hole right in the front of my shorts that I'm wearing

2208
03:17:29,380 --> 03:17:31,780
I just have a whole

2209
03:17:34,900 --> 03:17:36,900
How did this even happen?

2210
03:17:36,900 --> 03:17:38,900
You

2211
03:17:41,700 --> 03:17:43,700
Well, I

2212
03:17:44,580 --> 03:17:47,620
Remember the one I tweeted earlier or what I tweeted

2213
03:17:48,660 --> 03:17:52,500
It's on the front side. Remember what I tweeted about having buns of steel

2214
03:17:53,860 --> 03:17:56,180
So I've had these shorts since I was like 15

2215
03:17:59,540 --> 03:18:01,540
And I think the friction

2216
03:18:02,740 --> 03:18:04,740
from the front just

2217
03:18:05,140 --> 03:18:07,140
Destroyed them and now there's a whole

2218
03:18:10,500 --> 03:18:13,940
Little for for easy access if you will

2219
03:18:17,300 --> 03:18:23,060
And you're 56 now exactly I've had these for a very long time and I've maintained my figure in the process

2220
03:18:27,300 --> 03:18:30,020
Bit of a topic but I feel like you imitate doki bird's voice

2221
03:18:30,340 --> 03:18:35,460
I probably could because one time I was watching a lot of her streams

2222
03:18:35,860 --> 03:18:39,140
And then I went on to stream and then I realized I was talking like her

2223
03:18:40,100 --> 03:18:46,900
Well, like guys and she's like a little bit deeper and she has like a little bit in the back of her throat

2224
03:18:47,060 --> 03:18:49,060
and she kind of talks like

2225
03:18:49,700 --> 03:18:51,700
Hey guys, it's me doki bird

2226
03:18:54,740 --> 03:18:58,420

2249
03:21:54,580 --> 03:22:03,540
Doki trying to talk dirty hold on what I can't open it unless

2250
03:22:06,660 --> 03:22:08,660
If I caress it enough

2251
03:22:09,940 --> 03:22:11,940
If I say something nice to it

2252
03:22:12,500 --> 03:22:14,500
it'll be like

2253
03:22:14,740 --> 03:22:16,740
Hey there pretty girl

2254
03:22:17,700 --> 03:22:19,780
Have I told you the most beautiful door out there?

2255
03:22:25,140 --> 03:22:27,140
If I caress it enough it'll be open

2256
03:22:30,660 --> 03:22:32,660
Negative risk

2257
03:22:42,180 --> 03:22:47,700
We want to spread your hinges for me. Sorry. I'm right. That's it's literally called doki trying to talk dirty

I wish I had a very unique and distinct voice

2264
03:23:12,980 --> 03:23:18,820
I feel like my voice is kind of like a normal deeper register but a lot of people like I've listened to people sound like me

2265
03:23:19,620 --> 03:23:21,620
constantly

2266
03:23:21,700 --> 03:23:26,180
Um, so it's very interesting

2267
