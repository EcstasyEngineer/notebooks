1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You

6
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You

7
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You

8
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You

9
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You

10
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You

11
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You

12
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,960
Is that some better there's an echo

13
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,240
What about now

14
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,040
Why am I so bad at this

15
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You hear that

16
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You

17
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,880
Okay

18
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Okay, no more. No, you don't get it easy. We are getting rid of the AC. No AC for you.

19
00:07:47,000 --> 00:08:03,000
If you're European, no AC for you. What do you like the AC? Why do you like the AC?

20
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Okay, fine. I'll put it back. Okay, here it goes.

21
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Oh my god, that's too loud. Holy shit. Okay.

22
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
We'll have it like a little...

23
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You guys aren't going to be able to hear the AC anyways because I'm going to put rain sounds on. So like, what the hell?

24
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm mad at the people who are going to make me help before you. No. Congrats on quitting. You're such a badass, but honestly, I wouldn't be able to do it if it wasn't for you.

25
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's because of all the members that I'm able to do this. So I won't give credit where it's due. Yes, if you don't know, I quit my job.

26
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I just smacked my mouth against the mic.

27
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:32,000
My ear, my hands, my background, and 9 o'clock Eastern time is when my phone goes off, so my ears are red.

28
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I quit my job. It was actually very, very hard. I will probably cry tomorrow morning.

29
00:09:44,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Because, um, I think I'm supposed to cry, but it's because I've been there for almost six years, and...

30
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Oh, goodbye AC, but I've been there for almost six years. It was probably one of the best jobs I ever had until the company started making some changes.

31
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It was time to move on. I had outgrown everything, and I tried, you know, applying for a part-time position and a different part of my store, but it was time, it was time.

32
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I wasn't a manager, but I was a temporary assistant manager for quite some time.

33
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And you see, good this time in the background. Nothing else has changed. I kind of still have a sense.

34
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I hope you have a good time at leverage of what you do.

35
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:19,000
But I actually started, like, the ASMR, ASMR portion, because I have this whole role-play planned out.

36
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm not going to be reading any tonos or supas. You currently can't see any stream elements, tonos, or, and I turned off the words just so you can really immerse yourself.

37
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I want to do, like, a very serious role-play for you, a little bit silly, but mostly serious.

38
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm not going to go off the rails like I did last time.

39
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,000
But yeah, we're ourselves in the picture.

40
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Yes, I have so many triggers next to me. Actually, I have to go cook it some more, but I love the other room.

41
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:07,000
So, let me do that again. I'm sorry. Okay, I can't keep whispering. Let me just turn myself down for a second.

42
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Okay, I'm going to document this a bit.

43
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:19,000
But, like, lower. So, yeah, it's really hard.

44
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I can't really express how difficult it is, even though it's...

45
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:44,000
So, before I make this up, I'm going to read the tonos, don't know how many words, but don't miss the stuff on YouTube, so if you want to do that, okay?

46
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Turn myself up again? Okay, sorry.

47
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Yeah, I don't know how that works. I know...

48
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I know some people don't care about it at all, and some people like it right at the end.

49
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Yeah, yeah, it's... My parents are, like, very supportive. I'm obviously generally surprised. Sorry if I hear booby in the background.

50
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
But, you know, we'll look for another job.

51
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Guess what?

52
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Health and strength. He doesn't even know how. He just, like, moors. He just goes, like, whew whew whew.

53
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:57,000
He doesn't open his mouth. He doesn't meow. Yeah, he mows. Yeah, he does. He does a lot of that.

54
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Bring up his staring daggers at him right now.

55
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Okay, he's ignoring me.

56
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Let me see if I can do something.

57
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Like, yeah, I just wanted to, oh my fucking god, rena, what the fuck are you doing?

58
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
She just, she just jumped up on my desk and started sniffing the microphone.

59
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Basically, you just get a lot of chatting stream and great past and current don't knows.

60
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
What really?

61
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Maybe. Do you think you'd be good part of her?

62
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Possibly.

63
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I mean, I guess we could probably do something.

64
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
She slipped down. She was, like, a little suspicious.

65
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Okay, so I'm gonna get rid of, like, some of the noise that's going on.

66
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It's getting deep off. I think it's, like, my neighbor's voice is going off.

67
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
It just has a popping noise.

68
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Whoa.

69
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Can you hear that? I don't know if you can.

70
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Huh? Okay.

71
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Now I see for you.

72
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Oh my god, I'm so sorry.

73
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Jesus fucking Christ.

74
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm so sorry.

75
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I know that this sounds the same on the 3D hotel.

76
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:17,000
But, um, bearing off like it went down is more, that's actually the good thing.

77
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Louder.

78
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
This is literally my reason.

79
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
And then, like, the 3D picks up every little vibration.

80
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Hortics.

81
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
And then I try to just always go, go, go.

82
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:41,000
And just, like, we're, I mean, I'm still sitting on my desk just staring at the 3D.

83
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'm gonna go over there.

84
00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:02,000
But I, you know, I wanted to be able to, um, just rub a bit so I can help my abs out.

85
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
And I can check on you guys.

86
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
You can see where my head is at, you know.

87
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Uh, she knows that you guys are with me, yes.

88
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Um, cause I just, I might, like, cause like, what I was thinking.

89
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I read the donos at the end in the soopas, but then I kinda like, cut it from the void.

90
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I don't know if that's like, inappropriate.

91
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Again, I know.

92
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I'm not used to this.

93
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
So, please tell me what you think is best.

94
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I am willing to take any advice you can take.

95
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Um, hello everybody, just coming in.

96
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Cause I don't have a special pass.

97
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Yeah, can't we take on someone?

98
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Again.

99
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,000
But, um, I'm kinda in a world of emotions right now.

100
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,000
So, it might be a little, um, next few days.

101
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Could leave a little bit of thought and cut off the beginning of the next day.

102
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Oh, that's a good idea.

103
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
That's a good idea.

104
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I actually might do that as far as I can.

105
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I accidentally did that the next day.

106
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I like, come out, I just like tried to, I just like, saved it as a new video.

107
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
People were like laughing at me about it.

108
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I was like, cool man.

109
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
God damn it, I fucked it up again.

110
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Um, I might do that.

111
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I might do that.

112
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Good idea.

113
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Um, that's my good idea.

114
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
But yeah, it's, um, I already had my job.

115
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I like, mentored a lot of people.

116
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I was like, a new manager for a band.

117
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Um, I have amazing customers, amazing co-workers, um, on-state, amazing management.

118
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I won't lie about that.

119
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:11,000
We have, like, a bet of minutes, but then, like, the values of the company kind of dramatically changed in this act.

120
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Like, we're all so close.

121
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Um, my store was super huge.

122
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
We had, like, over a hundred employees.

123
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Um, and I can, like, 100% send me that.

124
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Most people were by family.

125
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Like, it sounds stupid, but, like, they were really awesome.

126
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Um, and, and I started there when I was younger.

127
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
And then, I kind of, like, grew up in the store.

128
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Like, I mean, I had a lot of experience.

129
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Um, learning how to be, like, in the customer-based position.

130
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
And it was just, it was just really awesome.

131
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Um, being someone to ask for a job site sale.

132
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I'm in the hallway with four of my best friends.

133
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I've had my own job, and all of them just left.

134
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
And a lot of them drained me.

135
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
And it was just kind of funny because now,

136
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
we've been following in our footsteps.

137
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Um, got up out of by someone.

138
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:25,000
No, no, it's like, um, my company is humongous.

139
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Uh, I'll say that much.

140
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Um, my ex-company.

141
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Um, it's all about what had happened.

142
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
It's just, like, you know, corporations, for instance.

143
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
You know how corporations are.

144
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:47,000
They just, uh, sometimes, yeah, they intersect.

145
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
They're corporations.

146
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
They're corporations.

147
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
And they need to make profit.

148
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Uh, sometimes, though, so there are values about their place

149
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
and their staff aside to kind of be like,

150
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
okay, how do we make more money?

151
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
You know, to sacrifice that, maybe,

152
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
don't drink the staff as well,

153
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
or maybe, like, you're in a hiring freeze for a long time.

154
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I mean, you did hire people,

155
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
but it's just stressed us,

156
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
that we're going to put us in other places

157
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
just to want to be, that wasn't our only job, you know?

158
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Like...

159
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:41,000
But yeah, it's, it is what it is, you know?

160
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
If this one dude just struggled to hear me,

161
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I bet he might be broke,

162
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
because everybody else seems fine.

163
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I'm so sorry.

164
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Yeah, they hurt themselves a lot, right?

165
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Like, a lot of people are leaving my company right now.

166
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Um, and, like, I'm not the first person,

167
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
like, me and one person,

168
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
literally left the same day.

169
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
And then, I think,

170
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
and another person was telling me

171
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
they just put in their two weeks.

172
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
It was so...

173
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
It is what it is.

174
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
So...

175
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I should probably come over here next minute.

176
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Yeah.

177
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Like, my reading, like, it wasn't normal reading.

178
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Um...

179
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
They had a very...

180
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Oh my god, I guess.

181
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
So much noise.

182
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Why are you doing it?

183
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Okay, there.

184
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
They're playing with toys.

185
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Um, Raina is slowly sleeping on my desk now,

186
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
right next to my third deal.

187
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Um, like, I don't want to take a picture.

188
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
She's sitting on my phone, never mind.

189
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Oh, my phone is lost due to the warmth that is raining.

190
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
But they were all super happy,

191
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
and I was like, oh, I'm streaming full time,

192
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
because a lot of them, um,

193
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
oh my god, they...

194
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
stopped.

195
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Um, a lot of them know that, um,

196
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I'm a streamer.

197
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
It's uncompressed.

198
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Um, they don't let me know what I am,

199
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
but, like, they're cool about it.

200
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
They're like, ah, I couldn't read it on the head.

201
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
It's so cool.

202
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I would say, like, I know what made this person

203
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
not like my mom, me, duper on the Internet.

204
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Nobody knows what a fucking me, duper is, bro.

205
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
You guys don't know the spell Raina or Boomi's name,

206
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
and then it's kind of funny.

207
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Um, yeah, she's literally alone on my desk.

208
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
The first move is stream every day.

209
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
No, I'm kidding, um,

210
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I'm probably gonna start me streaming

211
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
in my normal times after this week again.

212
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Uh, like, 4 p.m. in the start time

213
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
and do, like, five days a week,

214
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
because I realize I need a time to relax

215
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
and I need a time to clean my house.

216
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
It's the same fucking mess.

217
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I know, I know Raina,

218
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Raina, the queen in Espanol,

219
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
but she is Raina,

220
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
and there's someone that I liked

221
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
a lot in, uh, America's Next Stop Model.

222
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Hello.

223
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Uh,

224
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
A

225
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I

226
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
A

227
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
A, Raina.

228
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
And then Boomi is Boomi from Avatar,

229
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Game of Omosha.

230
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Um, he goes by Boompster.

231
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Um, Metro Woman wants a more

232
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
game of word.

233
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Um,

234
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I don't know, he goes by, um,

235
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
oh no, he got an M, so sorry.

236
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Um, he goes by Boomi, Boomerton.

237
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
He's still sp-spelled Raina Rock,

238
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
but it's okay, I love it best.

239
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
And then Fia is M-I-N.

240
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Somebody thought of this full name

241
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
was Metro Boomin.

242
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I'm like, you think I need my fucking cat,

243
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Metro Boomin?

244
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Who the fuck names her cat, Metro Boomin?

245
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
What?

246
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Raina?

247
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Is she fucking Australian?

248
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Although, um, in their, like, veterinary files

249
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
like Fia is Fia the Deathbed Companion,

250
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
redacted, aka my last name,

251
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
and then Boomi is Boomi, King of Omoshu,

252
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
redacted, my last name.

253
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
So yeah, um,

254
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I have allergies.

255
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Oh my god.

256
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Yeah, that's the problem,

257
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
but then Raina's just a big mama.

258
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Uh, she's also known as Jabba the Cat,

259
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
um, Queen of the, um,

260
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Mamas.

261
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
But hey, Mamas.

262
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I'm gonna pick up other things from her.

263
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
My dad calls her.

264
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Yeah, Jabba the Cat.

265
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Well, my dad calls her a wombat,

266
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
although he gets a wombat.

267
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I've used some Happy Bar all the time,

268
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
so that's what it really means.

269
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
What is...

270
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I'm trying to think what was going to say ever again.

271
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Boomi, King of Omoshu, my last name.

272
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Yeah, they're all wonderful kids,

273
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
and, um, Raina used to have a sister named Soleil,

274
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
before she passed away,

275
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
and she was, um, because of Raina,

276
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
so like, Raina and son, um,

277
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
yeah, I miss her, she's great.

278
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
But yeah, it actually reminds me a lot of her.

279
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
They have really similar personalities.

280
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
And then, before that, um,

281
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
all my other parents were named after

282
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Bible characters,

283
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
because I remember I grew up

284
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
with a religious household, so, yeah.

285
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I was like,

286
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I don't remember it, like, church.

287
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I was talking to

288
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
me and my, um,

289
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
like, my best friend at the time.

290
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Mind you, we're like, fucking dead.

291
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
And we're like, am I good?

292
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
If we ever had a son, we, um,

293
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
like, us together, we're like,

294
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
if I ever had a son,

295
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
like, well, we'd name ourselves.

296
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
And I was, like, dead set

297
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
on naming my kid Artist Xease,

298
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
because the fucking badass name,

299
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
like, just called art for sure.

300
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I'm like, oh, is it sure for Arthur?

301
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
No, bitch, it's sure for Artist Xease.

302
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Kick Artist Xease.

303
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Form of Fusula.

304
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Uh, uh.

305
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:50,000
A-R-D-E-X-E-R-X-E-S.

306
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Um, and then my friend was like,

307
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I would just

308
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
call, call my kid Paul,

309
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I'd like to go off this.

310
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Not those are loud.

311
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Jesus, I brought you some

312
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
uh, rickets and some murder.

313
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Murder.

314
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Oh, Judas.

315
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Great fun.

316
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I'd have a son so I could

317
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
be pulling your son from behind me.

318
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Um, but then I decided

319
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
that if I ever got, like, a badass dog,

320
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
that was a boy dog,

321
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I'd name my, um, Artist Xease,

322
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
or, like, some sort of just

323
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
crazy-ass name.

324
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Um, and if I had a girl dog,

325
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I'd want a great pair of these,

326
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
and I want to name her Ducky,

327
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
and she's gonna make you cute and fluffy,

328
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
and she's gonna guard

329
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
all my livestock at my farm.

330
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I don't think Ducky's cute.

331
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I should blow my nose.

332
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Uh, mind your ears.

333
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Name the kids after

334
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
altering characters to be super cool,

335
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
actually. Oh my god, I just kind of,

336
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
kind of burped before.

337
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
If I can name a me too,

338
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
don't worry, it will seem good.

339
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Shut up.

340
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
My son. Oh, good.

341
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Nobody cares about your penny,

342
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
is great.

343
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Hate, hate, hate...

344
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Now are you gonna see me play

345
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Elderdream DLC? Again, I don't

346
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
have an Elderdream for BC,

347
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I played it on PS5.

348
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
It's a comfort game of mine,

349
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
and I'm debating whether or not

350
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I should embarrass myself by playing it

351
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
online, um, and streaming.

352
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Just because.

353
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Like, I'm not good at games,

354
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Good at games, I like to take my time with them, so, you know.

355
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:35,680
I don't know, I don't want people to see me try hard.

356
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,080
Just watch Johnny play, she's hardly playing it this week,

357
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:42,440
I'm pretty sure, next week, you know.

358
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,040
I'm not like, I will play it from some, okay, maybe.

359
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,800
Cause I'm sorry, but I don't wanna play

360
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,920
another Crapstrap treasure lesson, like,

361
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,360
this sounds like a beat on stream,

362
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:59,160
cause the amp on black, bro, I was dying.

363
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,960
Starting to link the shot color.

364
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,400
I finally got my throat payouts,

365
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,520
so I was able to order my shot color.

366
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:13,280
So that should be it, at some point, I don't fucking know.

367
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:17,960
Cause throat payouts take more than two weeks.

368
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:22,960
I was the first person to have a shot color to my throat,

369
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,720
and I'm the last person to get it.

370
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,200
I think, I'm gonna move right now, cause she's,

371
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,760
well, she looks really comfy, but I need to,

372
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,840
oh, she fell asleep, I can't move her now.

373
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,040
I can't move this old lady.

374
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,480
I'm so cute, my god.

375
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,440
She's a dead out of dead love right now,

376
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,920
I'm not gonna lie.

377
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:59,000
Perfectly dug to no tail on sight.

378
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,160
Amazing form, dead out of dead love.

379
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:11,760
I'm also debating from switching from headphones

380
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,600
to, like, over the ear headphones to any ear headphones,

381
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:18,640
I'm realizing that headphones kind of hurt my ears.

382
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,640
I'm due at least to put my contacts in every time I stream.

383
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,520
Because my glasses, plus, just, I don't know,

384
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,320
do have a big head, maybe, I don't know,

385
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,080
maybe I got a big head, not a big head's brain.

386
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,440
I don't know, hope to one day eat.

387
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,080
Perfect.

388
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,480
That's the best, that's the best, that's the best.

389
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,960
Double-tie a five-head old bookie-gulu,

390
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,520
I mean, no, I won't, in my grip.

391
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,280
But in short, before I start streaming,

392
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,960
just know this is like a little role-playing new one,

393
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,080
I hope you like it.

394
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:06,000
Thank you guys so much for watching,

395
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,600
do put my jobs in.

396
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,640
Good to have done it.

397
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:13,520
I want to help you, all my, my, members,

398
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,440
strong, me, the girls, are so supportive,

399
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,600
and like, they're really my personal cheerleaders,

400
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:24,760
and I can't wait for them to, I don't know,

401
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,080
I don't know, I want some job,

402
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,040
but who doesn't help me on this, you know?

403
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:33,280
Like, they, when I'm like, move out, or change jobs,

404
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,080
or I hope they also get the opportunity,

405
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:41,680
no, I don't want to, so I'll bring anything,

406
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,400
because it is better to be free,

407
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,880
I love my job, it just changed, you know?

408
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,080
You got, you grow up, and you have to move on.

409
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:59,680
Of course, okay, tell me if this is too loud, okay?

410
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,520
Is that too loud?

411
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,240
Still, oh, I'm so sorry, okay, let me turn that down.

412
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,400
Okay, go, go, go, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

413
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,400
I'm sorry, hold on, hold on, hold on.

414
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:31,000
Okay, I'm gonna turn it down just a little bit more.

415
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,520
Okay, how's that, is that better?

416
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,280
Is that better?

417
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,440
Okay, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,

418
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,680
I mean, this sounds so good.

419
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,200
It looks so good.

420
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,020
Okay, a lot, a lot, a lot.

421
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:06,340
A lot, you can break kisses,

422
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:09,820
because you're about to be insulted a little bit, so.

423
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:14,940
I need to be louder, is that true?

424
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:21,100
I wish, sometimes, okay, YouTube, can you please,

425
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:24,500
please put in channel points, so people can redeem,

426
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:28,820
you're too loud, you're too quiet, I can be loud, okay, fine.

427
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:29,820
Let me turn myself on.

428
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:38,020
How's, how's that, is that, hi, oh, you got the AC,

429
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:49,740
you got the rain, perfect, it's like the AC too,

430
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:59,220
overbearing, or, my game, I'm like 18, it's gonna be real,

431
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,180
it's gonna be real, okay.

432
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:05,180
Dan, Dan, Dan, that's Rob, okay, okay.

433
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:13,140
We're gonna just see what happens.

434
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,900
Rain covers the AC, okay, perfect,

435
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:18,500
so we got some white noise, I think the AC will be good,

436
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,900
because I know this rain is copyright free,

437
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,300
but maybe the AC will kind of like,

438
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:30,180
be like the AI, well, I'm like a glaze,

439
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:34,780
so I'll get this again, it's running out of talk to me,

440
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:37,940
it was like, girl, you're gonna demonetize,

441
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:41,100
left or right, you need, and so I've been putting,

442
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,860
I'm gonna wear your cover up from now on, I'm sorry,

443
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:50,980
can you copy me, people, copy right, rain, okay, yes,

444
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:55,980
I know, it is what he said, it's what is true,

445
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:58,180
people copy right, fucking everything,

446
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:02,540
even if it's just fucking all beyonds, all beyonds.

447
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:10,220
I'm scared, rain is gonna lean on my keyboard,

448
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:19,220
I think that's good, hi, I don't know if you heard her squeak,

449
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:25,980
oh my god, your breath smells me, look at that,

450
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:40,820
why were you scared about a thunder coming after you?

451
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:44,440
Oh, thunder, thunder, thunder, thundercats,

452
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:50,940
it's really pretty outside, I wish I could take a picture

453
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:54,460
and see if you guys would mind my location,

454
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:00,940
it's like, big sky, and dusky, it's really pretty,

455
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:04,940
It's like pink sky and dusky. It's really pretty.

456
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:16,940
I almost named... I was debating whether or not it would be a Jidaro because she also kind of spots for some reason.

457
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:19,940
She's like really light spots, but I can do that.

458
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:21,940
Okay.

459
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:23,940
Oh my god, I'm so sorry.

460
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:27,940
Okay.

461
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:29,940
Okay.

462
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:32,940
I'll be ready to go get something.

463
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:46,940
Delicious.

464
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,940
I'll drink it warm on the heart.

465
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:53,940
Okay, one second.

466
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:58,940
Okay.

467
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:24,940
40 minutes of the appage. Let's go.

468
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:30,940
Sorry to put the phone right now.

469
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:31,940
Okay.

470
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:50,940
And we're starting.

471
00:40:58,940 --> 00:40:59,940
Hmm.

472
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:04,940
So weird to find one of those things here.

473
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:09,940
I've never seen anything like this before.

474
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:13,940
What is this? Do you know what side of the rain?

475
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:18,940
It's looking a lot like this.

476
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:20,940
Can't tell what it is.

477
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:28,940
It looks like a piece of trash.

478
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,940
I'm pretty sure it is trash.

479
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:35,940
And I still can't place it.

480
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:44,940
I guess I'll have to do some closer inspection.

481
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:50,940
I don't know if I want to get close to it.

482
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,940
It looks like it smells bad.

483
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,940
I'm pretty sure it smells bad.

484
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:03,940
At least it brought my umbrella, so I won't get soaking wet.

485
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:06,940
Okay.

486
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:07,940
Let's see.

487
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:12,940
Oh god.

488
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:20,940
It looks so much worse and I'm close with it.

489
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,940
I don't even know what that is.

490
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:25,940
What is that?

491
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:26,940
What?

492
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:33,940
I'm going to go over here.

493
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:35,940
Oh, yeah.

494
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:40,940
It does smell bad.

495
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:42,940
Gross.

496
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:47,940
No.

497
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:54,940
This has to be trash.

498
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:57,940
It looks like crap.

499
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:00,940
It smells like crap.

500
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:09,940
It does make sense that it's near a dumpster in this alley that I've had.

501
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:12,940
Okay.

502
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:19,940
But I just, I can't tell what it is.

503
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,940
Do I want to know what it is?

504
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:28,940
Okay.

505
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:29,940
Let me just...

506
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:43,940
I don't know.

507
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:03,940
I don't know what it is.

508
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12,940
Yeah.

509
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:41,940
No.

510
00:44:58,940 --> 00:44:59,940
No.

511
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:05,940
No.

512
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:11,940
No.

513
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:37,940
Wait.

514
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:39,940
Wait a second.

515
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:43,940
No, no, no, no, no, no.

516
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:49,940
I like stuff I can't tell what it is.

517
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:50,940
Okay.

518
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:52,940
Let me make some notes.

519
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:02,940
Maybe it's like an animal or something.

520
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:06,940
Or a creature.

521
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:08,940
No.

522
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:09,940
No.

523
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:10,940
A creature.

524
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:18,940
No.

525
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:19,940
Okay.

526
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:23,940
No.

527
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:24,940
No.

528
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:25,940
No.

529
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:26,940
No.

530
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:27,940
No.

531
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:28,940
No.

532
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:29,940
No.

533
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:30,940
No.

534
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:31,940
No.

535
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:32,940
No.

536
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:33,940
No.

537
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:34,940
No.

538
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:35,940
No.

539
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:37,940
No, I think so.

540
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:39,940
Alright, let's see here.

541
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:46,940
Yeah.

542
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:51,940
Wow.

543
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:52,940
Okay.

544
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:03,940
Let me remember the pencil on some of them.

545
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:28,940
I can sketch, what if I, oh yeah, shade right there, I'll just wrinkle it, whatever, that's fine, that's fine

546
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:39,940
and now, yeah, now this, this piece of trash is way out of there, that's what I drew, we just sliced that

547
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:51,940
now we're done, now we're done, I've never seen something so disgusting, I sliced that

548
00:47:51,940 --> 00:48:08,940
uh, now uh, it's like, it's like genuinely hideous, I can't stand to look at it, but like for science, I'll continue

549
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:13,940
okay, a couple of rounds

550
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:21,940
here

551
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:29,940
shade, okay

552
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:31,940
okay

553
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:36,940
whatever

554
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:38,940
shade, okay

555
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:51,940
okay, one of its, I don't know if that's one, it's, it's just dirty, nothing more

556
00:48:51,940 --> 00:49:00,940
okay, wait a second, what do I think?

557
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:19,940
okay, there's like something here, I think I can scratch it off, maybe

558
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:24,940
let's try it out

559
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:39,940
good thing I always have my tools on me to look at weird things and have the face that look like shade

560
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:40,940
shade

561
00:49:55,940 --> 00:50:00,940
this thing is kicked on, this is like mud or something like that

562
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:26,940
okay, it's just gonna take a little bit of time

563
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,940
okay, let's try it on

564
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:32,940
oh, oh, oh, okay

565
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:43,940
this thing, you may have purchased this thing, that's making it look like shade, but it's made me expect it, so it looks so good

566
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:48,940
it sounds kind of shiny

567
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:55,940
oh, oh, oh, that's disgusting, never mind, let's not do that

568
00:50:56,940 --> 00:51:09,940
Okay, now we're getting somewhere.

569
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:15,940
It's a weird, choking substance.

570
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:20,940
It's a weird, trashy object.

571
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:26,940
It reminds me of something here.

572
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:49,940
I'm going to put it over here and just brush the victim.

573
00:51:50,940 --> 00:52:06,940
Yeah, what if I do it slower?

574
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:17,940
If you think the stuff will melt away in the rain.

575
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:20,940
I think it doesn't have a mouth.

576
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:41,940
This thing was sitting in my mind.

577
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:52,940
Interesting.

578
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:54,940
My cats get out of here in the rain.

579
00:52:54,940 --> 00:53:06,940
I'm crazy.

580
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:08,940
Gosh, this stuff is so cute.

581
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:10,940
You have to put it on.

582
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:13,940
I'm very, very curious.

583
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:17,940
Oh, right here.

584
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:20,940
This one.

585
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:22,940
This one.

586
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:24,940
This one's black.

587
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:27,940
This one.

588
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:35,940
Brush.

589
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:37,940
Brush.

590
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:39,940
To bring it away.

591
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:51,940
Yeah.

592
00:53:51,940 --> 00:54:08,940
Better areas over here.

593
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:31,940
How do you even know what you're doing with this stuff?

594
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:37,940
What if this piece of junk is completely useless?

595
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:47,940
What if this piece of junk is completely useless?

596
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:57,940
What if this piece of junk is completely useless?

597
00:54:57,940 --> 00:55:07,940
What if this piece of junk is completely useless?

598
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:17,940
What if this piece of junk is completely useless?

599
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:27,940
What if this piece of junk is completely useless?

600
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:37,940
What if this piece of junk is completely useless?

601
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:43,940
Oh, no, that's my cat.

602
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:45,940
No, no, no, no.

603
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:59,940
Come on, pick it up.

604
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:02,940
Just toss it off.

605
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:05,940
That was a mess.

606
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:09,940
Just toss it off.

607
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:39,940
Just toss it off.

608
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:45,940
Just toss it off.

609
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:53,940
Just toss it off.

610
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:58,940
That's pretty good.

611
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:06,940
Oh, that was a big piece.

612
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:09,940
Almost there.

613
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:12,940
Barely done, so deep.

614
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:19,940
Just a little deeper.

615
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:22,940
Oh, this is really huge.

616
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:24,940
Do I got it?

617
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:28,940
Come on.

618
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:30,940
What is this?

619
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:31,940
This can't be trash.

620
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:40,940
Okay, papers.

621
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:51,940
Pretty trashy dust.

622
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:52,940
Interesting.

623
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:55,940
My color is green.

624
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:56,940
Is it brown?

625
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:59,940
Is it blue?

626
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:09,940
Is it blue?

627
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:19,940
Is it blue?

628
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:29,940
Is it blue?

629
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:39,940
Is it blue?

630
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:49,940
Is it blue?

631
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:59,940
Is it blue?

632
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:09,940
Is it blue?

633
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:19,940
Is it blue?

634
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:29,940
Is it blue?

635
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:49,940
Is it blue?

636
00:59:49,940 --> 01:00:09,940
Is it blue?

637
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:19,940
Is it blue?

638
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:26,940
Okay, one second.

639
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:59,940
Okay, one second.

640
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:09,940
Okay, one second.

641
01:01:09,940 --> 01:01:38,940
Looks a lot better than I did before.

642
01:01:38,940 --> 01:02:07,940
And the hearing is very interesting.

643
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:17,940
Okay, one second.

644
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:27,940
