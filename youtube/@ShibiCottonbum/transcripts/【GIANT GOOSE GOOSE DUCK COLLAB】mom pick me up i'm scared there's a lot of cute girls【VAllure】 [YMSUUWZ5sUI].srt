Hi, I

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,880
Am trying to fix my headphones like fell out of my ear as I switch scenes

11
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,320
Hello

00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,520

Oh, yeah, so sore I

00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,760
Also, I'm sad cuz I left my gamer subs

16
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:32,120
Across the room. Let me go get that cuz I'm thirsty. I don't know why my eyes are so like

17
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:39,000
Half-lidded I like I have a light turned on. I don't know if maybe my glasses are reflecting

18
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,040
Too lazy to shove contacts in my eyes to fix them

19
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,400
As you can see I'm up here which lets people know that I'm still talking to y'all

20
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:58,320
And then once I move down all on mute all on deafen and you guys can't you'll be able to hear like fart noises

21
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,400
There's a lot of fart noises, let me turn off my BGM

22
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,400
Oh

23
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,720

00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,560
Okay

25
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,440
Yeah, there's a lot of fart noises in the game. I was I pointed out in our discord

26
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,160
I'm like you can still hear the fart noises when you deafen in game

27
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,720
Okay

28
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,800

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,640

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,720
I

32
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,840
Had to flip her I have to flip her like she's a little like a little hamburger. She's a little borgger

33
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,160
Make sure she's good

34
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,000
Don't want her laying on the same side for like hours

35
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:03,840
Yeah, yesterday was really fun it feels like a dream feels like it didn't really happen

36
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,400
I

37
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,840
Super EP guys are EP2 we're gonna have a nice EP stream

38
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:17,200
I hope I can match the energy today for all the girls because I'm in the chat and I'm just like wow

39
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,280
It's also a lot of us and when there's a lot of people sometimes I get really shy

40
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,800
Um, and if it's like four people I'm like I'm okay, and I don't shut up or if it's a bunch. I'm just like

41
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,120
Oh

42
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,240
So, um, I hope you guys enjoy. I never played this game before. Um

43
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,000
I bet they're waiting for the rest of us. So I'm gonna move down

44
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,400
Um and go talk to the other girls. I'll try to like chat from time to time to you guys

45
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,480
Um and like mute so only you guys can hear and stuff

46
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,560
But ye I've texted voiced it. Um

47
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:01,360
Oh my god, push to talk turned on so that I have to push to talk because my ac would probably be funny and on the other girls streams

48
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,400
Okay

49
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,840
Oh, I'm nervous it's a lot of cool people here. This is a lot of sonic

50
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,560
This is a great thing to open to

51
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,800
Yeah, all right

52
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,040
I come back to shadow the headshot. Are we debating shadow the headshot for you?

53
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,480
Okay, pissing all by yourself handsome

54
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,560
Hot that's fine. All right. Anyways

55
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,600
A lot of things are working because everybody's deafened to do proximity chat

56
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,400
I just left it there. So you guys can see who's here. So can we start with uh

57
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:13,120
Discord order because that seems really easy. So I mean go first. I blasted discord. So is it here's the stage?

58
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,600
Yeah

59
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:22,960
Yeah, oh hi me. I'm Aimee. I'm from you. I post this first generation remedy. I'm an AI played up that. It's nice to meet you

60
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,080
My beloved

61
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,920
I bet I wonder what time it is for her because I don't know. Maybe it's super early. I'm not sure

62
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,720
I'm gonna check what time it is

63
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,840
I'll see you then

64
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,400
And I am the best duck tech

65
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,520
Oh my gosh

66
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,520
Ever seen

67
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,560
Get on stage

68
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,120
You can do it whatever whatever's comfortable

69
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,800
I left them locked

70
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:38,320
As your stage is up there go up past the monitor. Oh wait, I walk around aimlessly

71
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,280
Oh

72
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:03,840
I'm gonna introduce myself in an elu voice should I introduce myself in like a really funny voice?

73
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,440
I'm last so I gotta make it funny

74
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,200
Because this chord goes in alphabetical order

75
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,800
Although it's a momie's name and discord is something different. So

76

So I was in the loading bay. Oh, this is so huge. Did they just kill me?

131
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,480
Did they do it on purpose it doesn't show if their ducks are gooses

133
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,520
This is really just a

134
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:18,880
Reskinned among us. I don't understand because this looks exactly like a different map and among us

135
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,680
the heck

136
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,800
I'm like 99% sure this is a map and among us. Am I tripping?

137
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,520
Oh, there the ducks

138
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,240
Look at them

139
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,240
First thing are you okay?

Oh, let me see if I can test how do I test it?

143
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,960
I don't

144
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,040
Know how this works doesn't let me show

145
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,720
Okay, wait, wait, wait. Where was the body found? I mean, where was it found?

146
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,640
It was near the medical checkup place where I was doing

147
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:28,800
I think it was and there was a place with vines and stuff. I'm not very good. Let me check them up. It was near the

152
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,560
I'm so sorry

153
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,720
Oh, yeah, I was gonna say um people be careful when you're trying to go from one side to the other

154
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,320
Apparently the ship will crush you. We want she be I um

155
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,680
We we ran her over she's a smear in the pavement. I mean, why would they call it?

156
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,440
Why would they call the ship if I'm sitting there cleaning stuff? They saw me on the platform

157
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,280
I don't know why like how are they?

158
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:46,000
And I they're not even the bad guys. They just straight up killed me. I love being alive

159
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,240
Oh, I'm a ghost

160
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,240

165
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,920
Did I do my task when I'm dead?

166
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,480
That's a great question

167
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:16,080
Oh, where the fuck am I? How'd I get out of here? I wish I could change the key. Wait, hold on. Maybe I can

173
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,240
Are both of them ducks?

174
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,720
There's three ducks. I didn't know wait. I thought there was only two. How is there three now?

175
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:45,360
Is that a thing? I mean, you know how if they're they're ducks or not. Oh, here we go

176
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,600
Because I'm standing near them and it says duck

177
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,800
No, no, oh god, I had to die

178
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,760
We how did I die from the dock? That's so stupid

179
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,640
What the hell

180
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,360
We people need to not do the tasks and then call the thing

181
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,560
Oh my god

182
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,120
Don't be you duck 40. I can hear you guys

183
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,560
Hello. Yeah, even it doesn't need proximity when you're dead

184
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,000
Oh, how did it got you to mommy?

185
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,280
It doesn't mean you all like them

186
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,600
It's cooking

187
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,960
To my tasks, I was like trying to find my task and she was like

188
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,440
And I was just like well

189
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:36,320
Where am I? I have to go all the way up there. This is such a huge map. I have to move so far. Okay

190
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,360
Where's my task gear?

191
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,040
I don't know what's happening

192
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,640
Oh, I thought it was mercy screaming. I'm sorry. It was not

193
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:57,040
Avian carcass found. I kind of wish we played them. I'll go

194
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,040
Superb like at least I don't have to play that game

195
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,840
Um

196
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,320
How could this happen to me

197
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,280
I'm just

198
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,680
Yes

199
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:59,600
I'm trying to figure out what's going on

200
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,120
I'm so lost guys. I'm so lost

201
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,800
Are we gonna all die?

202
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:23,040
Your order arrived today. What'd you order? What'd you order for your gamer subs? I'm drinking lean

203
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,880
I had the mango yesterday. The mango was really really good

204
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,680
I didn't want to drink an energy one before

205
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,760
You have to like walk over to

206
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,720
Whatever

207
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,280
Yeah, if you see something glowing you just hover over it

208
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:58,080
Okay, good luck queen. I am so confused about how to do these. I don't know what's happening either. I don't even

209
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,480
Where am I? Who am I?

210
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,440
It's also hard to find the task

211
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,560
What is this?

212
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,200
This is for smart people. Oh, okay

213
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,080
This will be fine. All right

214
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,720
That was really confusing for a second. I thought I had to like do some sort of matching thing

215
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,120
But a different sort of matching thing

216
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:29,840
Okay, okay. I see it. I see it. I want to do this. What are there's fake things that we have to do

217
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,880
understood

218
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,360
Orange

219
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,360
That's an inky bag

220
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,960
Okay, that'll just give me something to do so while I'm bored. This is kind of gross. I don't want to do it

221
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,960
Yes, I understand the task

222
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:50,480
I mean, oh, at least I can float through walls. Why could I float through one wall and not another?

223
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,880
But doesn't make any sense. Is this a shower? Okay. Ew

224
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,880
Wing ex

225
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,680
I can do this. I'm doing this. Why does that thing show up right there? I don't know

226
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,680
This one

227
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:16,160
Are you match up the lines? I'm trying to find the one that's where's the shuttle platform

228
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,480
I had to eat an egg

229
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,920
One more. I think one more. I think it was this one the one that I died at

230
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,620
Did you just what just happened over there? Did you just give birth?

231
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,680
Yeah, so did I

232
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,440
I highly don't don't ever stand over here

233
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,320
I did it. I did my task. I did my tasks

234
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,840
Also, I mentioned, hey, scion is messing with there's three ducks surrounding scion. I felt

235
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,960
There's three ducks surrounding scion that is must there I am

236
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,760
Shit

237
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,760
We're gonna get him

238
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,440
Oh my god, that was just me with all of the ducks

239
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:24,240
Never trust the spanish inquisition. It's the last time I show anyone anything I swear to god

240
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,360
Actually, I don't know if eggia speaks spanish. I know lia does

241
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,080
I can't believe I can't I can't believe you've done this

242
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:46,000
I'm so sorry. You did it in purpose. Didn't you you want to take me out of the picture then, huh?

243
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,680
Yeah, likely story

244
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,120
No one should ever give me the ability to drive

245
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,640
We're provoking your license

246
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,600
You missed me being accused in dying from being hit by a car

247
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,200
That's okay. I haven't had a chance to look at stuff because I've been busy

248
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,680
I can't believe I was showing you guys something

249
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:35,920
Okay, one scion sitting on it. No, I was dead. I was part of the

250
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,440
Wait, did we lose? I don't know. I didn't even see the spanish inquisition. I was looking at chat

251
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:47,120
I'll do random for some of them. All right. All right random guys. I'm so epee. I don't know what's going on

252
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:53,120
There's too many people. Mom, pick me up. I'm scared. That sounds good. You did win. Oh, I didn't know

253
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,960
Where's vulture? I thought I thought we lost because they were at the top. I guess not

254
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,560
I just did I was looking at the screen. I didn't read it. Okay

255
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,680
Oh, you can only have vulture. All right. Is this sound good by the way? Am I too loud or are they too loud?

256
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,880
Okay, are you guys are we smooching? Is this allowed?

257
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,120
It was an unmuted. Is there a way is there a way to

258
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,160
Lengthen the meeting time?

259
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,320
Yeah, yeah

260
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,120
Yeah, the meeting time was pretty

261
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,360
Wow, I have them halfway and they're a bit loud. I'm gonna turn them down some more for you though

262
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,480
60 seconds

263
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,920
So a minute and a half is that enough? Okay. Yeah

264
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,600
Oh, you know why do you have to sit on my headphones?

265
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:56,320
So the rules are random. You may or may not become a Canadian or a vulture or something else. Okay. What does that mean?

266
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,440
What does that even mean?

267
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,120
Give me my green card. I'm uh, what?

268
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,360
I'm always a comedian

269
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:15,280
Oh, what's the deal with airplane food? I'm just gonna leave

270
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,840
Can I throw myself out the window is that a thing?

271
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,520
Okay, everyone's starting

272
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,040
Stairs at Azura lovingly

273
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,560
Affectionately I'm a goose

274
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,360
Okay

275
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:51,840
Okay, at least it closed like I'm close to my first thing I ran out on my lap Tomomi's right there

276
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,320
I can't even click it Tomomi just did it

277
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,880
Tomomi took my task

278
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I didn't think that was a thing

279
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,160
I'm not even supposed to be here. Where am I?

280
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,560
Uh, okay. I have something to do in the bio lab, which is up here

281
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
What you

282
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:26,160
Okay, I I can probably vouch for Tomomi if Tomomi's fine or they would have killed me by now

283
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,240
My little little tomboy

284
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,840
In girly pop. All right, so that's good

285
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,640
um

286
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:43,760
All right, probably just need to go to the teleporter. Does it teleport me? So does it teleport me across?

287
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,400
There's a bar there. I can't walk

288
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:55,680
Oh ain't that nifty. Can I freaking leave? Uh, okay, let's go up here because I see a yellow dot

289
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,680
I love Tomomi Tomomi's voice is cute

290
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,560
Oh

00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,560
Hello

00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:11,120
Uh, I feel like I'm standing where I'm supposed to be the tasks again are very hard to get to

293
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
How I do I have to

294
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,520
What do I have to adjust to no, am I being surrounded?

295
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,920
I mean, I mean, I swear to god, you're you've given me PTSD

296
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,600
Stay away from me

297
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,280
I don't even know how to do this stupid task

298
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,680
What the heck

299
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,920
Why is the sn boobs?

300
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,840
You know, what is it? What's it? I can't tell how do I change the temperature? It's just showing me them

301
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:52,320
Hello, hi rain. Oh water them. I have the water but no, it's telling me to change the temperature

302
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,320
I don't know what to change the temperature to it just says s slash n boobs

303
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,720

00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,480
I figured it out. I figured out the temperature

305
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,680
I'm wicked smart

306
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,720
As they say I'm bastard

307
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,640

I just I just checked in Ryan Goosling. Uh, I also have to check in Ryan Goosling

310
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,960
That just scared the crap out of me

311
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,720
What was that screaming noise? Why is everybody dead?

312
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:47,440
I'm like the two people I hung out with for a small amount of time are dead

313
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,840
Wait, I realized I said that and it sounds weird. No because I was saying to my chat

314
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:00,800
I was like, oh, I can vouch for tomomi and scion and then they're dead now. So

You guys saw me struggling with the temperature thing, please

318
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:26,480
I don't think it I don't think it's meadow because I saw meadow. I think it was she'd be earlier

319
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,920
Yeah, mero was chillin me. We were doing tasks together

320

00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,920
I don't know. I feel it. I feel it in my belly button

00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,440
Wait, wait, you have to tell us why though. No, I just I just said I just don't trust her from the amaga school

323
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,080
Okay, I don't

324
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:05,280
Mercy is literally a yandere and captures people. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh was I supposed I don't even know how to vote

325
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,360
How do I vote?

326
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,120
That's why I tried talking to irie that makes sense then

327
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,320
Okay

328
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:20,560
Oh, I don't even know what just happened

Okay, I don't trust listen. I don't think it's meadow

332
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:44,080
But I haven't seen Imi. I haven't seen Imi very often in this round

333
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,080
But Imi creeped up behind me

334
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:50,240

Audibly apparently

361
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:03,280
I had a conversation about how that exact smudge on the floor was what she be was

In the last round. Oh, true. The last she be hot. You've happened to you too

Yeah, and then we warned you rain. So I don't know like she be at least

365
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,920
Why does it cut people off like that?

366
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,760
I

367
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,840
Taking credit for rain's death

368
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:38,480
I killed rain. I didn't but I like to say I did

369
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,080
Rain killed herself she couldn't take the pressure

370
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:56,240
I don't know if they can actually dead people can hear each other in the chat

What are the roles mean?

374
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,960
No

375
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,920
How did I read this connect?

376
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,920
Yeah, before everything I was hanging out with mira

377
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,480
I also haven't seen coconut like

378
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:55,760
Oh my god, it's gonna be so funny when serenity or mercy they have to turn to one just like kill each other

379
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,320
It's gonna it's gonna be like hunger games

380
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,080
To the stars team rocket blasting off again

381
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,480
Oh my god the screaming

382
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:24,880
I'm taking credit for that kill I'm to it's me. I haunted the train and got you to kill yourself in minecraft

383
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,800
I'm sorry my wrathful ghost. She led me. I trusted her

384
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,880
I keep getting betrayed

385
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:44,800
I like how it does a dramatic zoom when you walk away watching if I step over here

386
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,600
Wait, hold on

387
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,920
I think oh, yeah

388
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,680
Oh my god

389
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:21,760
This is their trauma. This is when we grow boss gay keep

391
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,720

00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,880
I'm not an easy target. I'm just very trusting. Okay

393
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,440
And give people the benefit of you know, it's funny because I was sitting with rain and I'm like wait

394
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,160
I literally have to go with my gut

395
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:50,480
Because at some point I was when I was alone with rain after she stopped to hang out with me and I said rain come back here

396
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,800
I like

397

00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:15,200
Can't even do that. Are you winning mom joke because madame is actually winning. I'm not even doing anything. I'm dying so early

00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:36,800
I could I could be I like that voice. Sorry. I had to mimic it

404
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,960
That's that's the echolalia for you

405
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,360
I'm the Luigi. Oh

406
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:54,400
I'm a pimp and a detective. I'm gonna cry in this corner. It's still broke. How do you get far?

407
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,120
Oh, I can get money

408
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,840
You have to enable it

409
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,720
I can have a poopy bronze

410
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,160
All of a poopy bronze

411
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,600
I don't have any farts

412
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:12,960
It's firing in the shot. I have to make my own fart noises. Oh, yeah, it is in the shot

413
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,680
This one's great too. Oh

414
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:19,120
I want to be a maid so bad. I want the bead claw

415
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,760
I just want to be a maid

416
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:33,760
Yeah, I thought that you could pick some things but now it's my strategy

417
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:39,520
Oh the putt raised crystal ball into the stratosphere. I'm gonna grab some water if you're weak

418
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,080
Put my normal outfit on

419
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,480
I'll just bend it. I don't know when I'll be back

420
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:51,200
Scion just turned into an emo kid. I don't know what you're talking about. This is my usual outfit

421
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,240
Where are you?

422
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,480
Oh

423
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,560
Where are you?

424
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,000
Check yes, Juliet. Are you with me?

425
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,840
If I were gonna do the Hannah Montana transition song

426
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,240
Well, yeah

427
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,880
Rain is falling down

428
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:41,360
Why am I peeking my mic so much? I'm so sorry

429
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,720
Oh my gosh, it's all gotcha

430
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:47,360
Yeah, rain is yeah

431
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,800
There used to be like an actual store

432
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:58,000
But now it's gotcha on dust, I guess because I guess that means if people play it on but don't spend money

433
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
They can use all of their silver

434
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:06,560
To get dust and spend it question mark question mark. What a terrible system. Yes

435
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:17,040
You traded my life for 30 pieces of silver you Judas you traitor

436
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,760
What's up be right in the back

437
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:31,360
I can I can be an exhibitionist just a little longer if I spent 4 000 dust. I can get a police hat

438
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,240
If I spend 20

439
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,080
That doesn't sound like it if I kill myself

440
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:47,040
Get me out of here. It's so expensive to be an e-girl. Oh, I can hear them. I feel like people are getting outfits that I don't see

441
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,160
Wait, if I pay a thousand dust I can become a cultist

442
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,000
That's pretty nice. You can also become the lord of morgore

443
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:03,840
Why is there a morgore right here? What? I want to be a freaking shark

444
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:09,440
I want to be a gragora. It's 20 bucks. I'm not spending 20 bucks though. Oh, there's a chandelier hat

445
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:14,720
It's a dust shop. I became a cultist. How do I get dust? I want this piece of bread on my head

446
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:20,880
How do I get like I how where do where do I spend the real money? Like how does this translate to that?

447
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,480
This is from levels. This is from money. What does this do?

448
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,360
Like the most of the transactions

449
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,080
I'll do whatever this is

450
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:37,440
Are we starting or are we waiting? I'm just waiting. I don't know what this means. Okay. Okay. Hold on. She's typing something

451
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,240
I'm typing

452
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,880
I got seven dust

453
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:49,920
What does that do his mermaid makes me happy. I don't know. He's such a pretty mirror. I need 150 of that

454
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,200
That is the stupidest thing ever

455
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,760
What is this stupid ass break? I'm so frustrated right now

456
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:05,440
I just want to spend money. Wait, wait stand next to kakone and I can have a sushi train for me. Maybe I'll just buy

457
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,440
I

458
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,160
Could be a little sailor duck delicious

459
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,320
We fi we fi we fi we fi we fi

460
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:22,880
Oh, she only has mobile like fortune teller. Oh, no. Tell me your greatest secrets

461
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,600
What this isn't given up money

We'll do another game and then I'll check on you. Okay. Okay

463
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:38,000
That's high. Let me get real money. My debut is hella scuffed. It was bad. So I can spend

464
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:46,000
2,000 coins if I spend a hundred dollars and they give me nothing. That sounds pretty decent. It's to call it the IHOP the international house of pain

465
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:53,440
That's about right, but let's go. I'll start game everyone, please. Okay, let's go

466
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,520
On gbd drink it

467
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:06,000
I know this it's also giving me a little bit of sensory overload with the sound. That's why sometimes I just like zone out

468
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,680
Hello

469
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000

And I am in me

471
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:41,280
What does this do? Oh, I'm supposed to hit the bags the heck

472
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,440
I just squashed some ants

473
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,120
My hand like a boss. Stay away from me rain

474
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:51,120
Oh

476
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,560
What

477
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,320
Some of these tasks are confusing I I'm a simple girl

478
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,880
Very simple minded

479
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:18,320
Because I'm like, do I do these in order? I don't think I do. I think I'm just supposed to go through them

480
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:22,080
What the heck

481
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:25,440
Sometimes my thing clicks too fast. That took too long

482
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,880
I'm so too wait. I heard someone say no. Who was that? Are they dead?

483
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,840

00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,320
Why oh what's going on in here to cover that buck quack

486
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,680
I'm telling a jerk to reassure zura. I'm safe

487
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:56,080
So I said why did ducks cover the

488
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:02,720
Why did ducks have tails and is to cover the butt quack? Oh, you're so funny. I'll see I'll see you later

00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,840

00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:38,080
Oh, do I have to do that then do that whatever that doesn't make any sense. Um

00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,360

Don't think that I think that's the number of ducks killed

543
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:28,960
I think rain got kicked out of the room

544
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,960

There's a door in the top left main menu settings. Yeah

00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:58,640
All right, I'm gonna hide my screen for a second

551
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,040

553
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,680
The tents

554
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
So tense

555
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:22,160
Oh

556
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,480

557
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:29,440
Let me over-stimulate it

558
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,480

Why isn't she loaded in if it's her room? That's very interesting. Wait. Yeah

561
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:49,200
Because like that was the same code as the old one

562
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,680
Oh my gosh, okay. Well later alligators

563
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,480

Okay, yes, what is this the omega? Hold on. Nobody can hear me. Nobody can hear my funny joke

568
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,800
Is this the omega verse?

569
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,760
Is this the omega verse but geese?

570
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,280
I'm an alpha

571
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,280
I'm an alpha male

572
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:47,120
Who wants to be my discord kitten?

573
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,440

574
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:58,800
So eager she is an alpha. I'll buy you all the nice skin baby girl

575
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:06,480
Yeah, you want the pink mercy skin? I got you

576
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
No, we are a little discreet

577
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,800
Actually, you know what I'm a sigma

578
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:20,080
Sigma ball

579
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:32,880
Okay

580
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:35,360
Oh, yeah

581
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:46,480
First order as alpha of the geese pack

582
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,480
Everybody kiss the person to your left

583
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,200
Everybody's leaving

584
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:11,680
It's also like kind of sucks because I like I try to do a joke but sometimes the joke can't land because everybody's like

585
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:26,000
Ow, I just hit my oh, I just hit my wrist really hard against my

586
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:30,560
Desk oh

587
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:33,280
Oh

588
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:36,320
That hurt a lot

589
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,720
A psionid raider unmuted

590
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:50,320
Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I kind of wish I slammed it harder

591
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,400
Let me know a let me explain

592
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:58,080
So like I have like the beginning of one of those like

593
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:00,640
bumps on your wrist

594
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:08,560
Because my joints are are messed up and so some normally sometimes you can take a giant like book and like slam it down

595
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:11,440
on

596
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:13,440
And like pop pop it

597
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:19,040
Last time I because I'm a weirdo

598
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:24,080
I took a syringe and I drew out the liquid from it myself and then it went away for a bit

599
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:28,000
But then it came back because you need to get them. It's a ganglion cyst

600
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:33,040
It's just like your joint fluid seeps out of your joint. They're very very common. Um

601
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:35,840
It's like a clear liquid

602
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:43,200
Yeah, you can't see though like you guys have seen my hands you can't see it's only when I like really bend my wrist that you can see

603
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:46,560
It's like a little divot

604
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,440
But yeah, no, I like took a

605
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:54,000
I took a needle and I drew out the liquid and I'm like, oh, yeah

606
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:58,000
I watched like a youtube video of some dude like he just like slammed it with a bible

607
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:01,200
Like a giant. No, it was this I watched this video

608
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:04,400
Yeah, this I think it was like this lady and her husband

609
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:08,880
She like slams a bible on the one on his wrist and it pops and it was insane

610
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:10,720
um

611
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:14,960
How much you want my joint fluid how much for the fluid and then another one

612
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:18,160
I just you just see this guy like his dirty bedroom and he's like

613
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:22,000
So, yeah, you're gonna take an alcohol pad and you're gonna wipe the area

614
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:25,440
And then you're gonna take a needle and then you're gonna draw out the needle

615
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:27,840
You draw the liquid through the needle

616
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:33,280
You can pop it

617
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:35,840
It was really weird because it's like a perfectly clear liquid

618
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,200
It looks like a like a clear gel

619
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:42,080
No, we're not that kind of bible

620
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:44,560
You freaks

621
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:49,040
Wait, did they post the new discord? No, I mean the new room

622
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:51,600
Okay

623
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:53,920
I'm gonna take a moment

624
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:58,320
But here. No, I actually know my camera is not connected right now or I'd show you guys

625
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:01,280
um

626
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:06,400
Yeah

627
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:14,720
I think it's a bodily fluid here. I wouldn't want to buy truth. All right. I'm mentally preparing myself to go into this

628
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:17,440
Very loud room

629
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:23,040
Yeah, the better results here, you know

630
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:27,520
But like I also don't want like to get up my

631
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:32,080
I don't want to get my um

632
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:36,240
Like have an actual surgery on my wrist for assist because it like I could just keep

633
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:40,880
Drawing out the liquid. I haven't done it in a while or I could smack it

634
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,920
Oh, that actually hurts

635
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:50,080
It's like a weird bump

636
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:56,160
I'll stuff it in my mouth. Yeah, I need to be ready

637
01:03:57,040 --> 01:04:05,040
Really bro, I still don't know what that means. Really. I'm not gonna spell it. Nobody spoon feed them. Nobody spoon feed

638
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,920
No, that's tracking you doesn't help that

639
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:15,840
Yes, sir

640
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:29,120
Is this where the farts are

641
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:31,680
What's a fought?

642
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:48,800
Oh, okay, I thought I was like the the goose equivalent of a thought it's just a fought

643
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,800
What

644
01:04:56,320 --> 01:05:00,480
Did not catch that can I please be something other than a goose

645
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:07,760
Oh

646
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:10,160
I'm gonna haunt it

647
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:14,160
Oh, hey, what's up

648
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:21,760
And good luck

649
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:30,000
They're trying to figure that out. So wait, who was that that was

650
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:36,320
That was nia and I think it was

651
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,360
No, I don't I can't remember. Yeah, it was okay. It was nia and marrow

652
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:44,080
Um, so they're probably good

653
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,200
And I have the popcorn now

654
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:56,160
Making popcorn. Yeah, I'm making popcorn, but how do I make the popcorn and pop? I don't know. Did I do it?

655
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:58,080
How does it pop?

01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:00,080
I just press the button someone else pop it

657
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:06,000
But how do we make it pop? I don't know. It's it looks like it's popping. Maybe you have to like wait for it

658
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:12,720
I hope maybe you're trapped to try not to burn it burn it. Do you have to like unpress the button on the top left top left?

Catch rabbits. Oh, that just scared me

680
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:11,360
What rabbits are we catching?

681
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:17,360

01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:46,640
Well, I found it. I think this is the one I totally messed it up

You think so I do but they love me

699
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:24,720
That doesn't matter in this game of life or death. Love is not an option

700
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:29,360
Okay, I'll come with you

701
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:35,520
You're almost done our tasks

702
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:46,880
I'm gonna guard you

703
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:52,640
Actually, I have something down here in the tent, but I don't want to leave you so I want to sit right here

704
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,840
I'm scared

705
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:59,280
Wait

706
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:01,280
Oh

707
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,840
Okay, Nia was doing the ring toss

708
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:15,920
No, I came from the casino. I mean, I was in the casino with rain and rain sound silly

709
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:21,360
Nia was doing the ring toss

710
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:29,200
Yeah, let's just do this again. Nia was using the ring toss. I was with she be but I was doing the fortune thing

711
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:32,960
Well, Nia speaks mostly Spanish

712
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:38,960
I feel like it's serenity and I mean they look really suspicious

713
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:54,640
I don't know about that. That sounds like someone who killed a Zura would say

714
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:02,240
Likely

715
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,400
What does that mean

716
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:23,440
Uh

717
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:26,080
Mercy

718
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:28,880
No

719
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:31,600
Oh

720
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:38,480
Why do I gotta shoot tiger poop? This is the grossest thing ever. I don't like it

721
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:43,440
We're almost done our tasks

722
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:50,320
What rabbit

723
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:54,960

726
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:13,440
You're gonna see dead bodies and it's not for me

727
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:25,040
Okay, I wasn't right. I knew it. I knew it was I mean

728
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:36,960
I don't even I don't know what the roles are

729
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:39,120
I am murdered me

730
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:44,720
I don't know what's happening. I think

731
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:53,200
Maybe if I can add a new role here, there might be not enough tasks. Yeah, let me increase the mask. We keep getting task wins. Yeah

732
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:56,560
Yeah, I'm gonna do y'all are too slow

733
01:13:57,280 --> 01:13:59,280
March I think

734
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,840
Can you not

735
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:06,000
Is it because I'm rain and I mean just constantly I believe are always

736
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:10,960
The people because they just they're just such good. I don't trust them from

737
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:26,080
My three killers. I think three killers is a little too much. So much. Yeah. Yeah

738
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:30,320
It's large now X this is regular large not extra

739
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:32,480
Snacks

740
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:58,800
When I saw Deadpool, yes, I got peanuts. I got chocolate covered peanuts eat four corpses to win

741
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:01,520
Okay

742
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:03,600
What's a vulture to do?

743
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:07,760
Oh, so I really don't have to do anything. I have to eat people

744
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:13,680
I heard going up to get some water

745
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:16,880
It's fine

746
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:21,040
They can't kill me right

747
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:25,520
Because then I might just get up to get some water

748
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:39,200
I'm eating airheads. I'm a corpse eater call me dung eater the way I desecrate that

749
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:47,280
Oh my god, why do I keep getting jumpscared by the roller coaster?

750
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:55,040
Let's pop in

751
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:01,440
All the life

752
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:08,480
Let's go meeting bell. I don't think I have to do that

753
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:18,080
Pretend I'm talking to the fortune teller how I'm supposed to eat a body

754
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:29,280
The task sucks, yeah, it's annoying gotta crack the egg or whatever it is

755
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:38,880
You open this bag

756
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,320
Naya

757
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:44,080
Naya

758
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:46,080
I want to do this

759
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:50,560
I'm sorry. I'm I'm eating snacks. So I paused

760
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:56,240
Oh time to eat

761
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:09,360
Wait a second. I saw Naya just with igna first right before

762
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,840
And then she cornered me

763
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:16,800
Let me stare at each other the roller coaster

764
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:19,520
Yes, I've been riding the roller coaster

765
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:23,440
You can actually

766
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:35,360
I think you're the dodo. I think you're the dodo. I'm just chilling

767
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:40,240
It's not I need this time. What does a dodo do? It's not I mean because I mean I were doing

768
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:46,240
I can't open this bag. I mean keep on getting getting getting the villain this time

769
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,120
I want to be the bill. I want to be a killer

770
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:53,120
Not this whatever this bowl is

771
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:06,160
Let's go let Naya kill more people

772
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:09,840
Oh no

773
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:15,200
Sorry, I'm eating peanuts. I'm gonna stay with you. I gotta go down here

774
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:22,000
Follow Naya. You're so right though

775
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:33,200
And then

776
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:36,320
It's like a smoothie

777
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:39,200
What no

778
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:43,440
I didn't know how to get on

779
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:55,200
Um looking for people to eat this map is so huge wait Jesus

780
01:18:56,640 --> 01:19:00,640
Okay, Naya was over here. Wait, is this pointing me towards a corpse?

781
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:02,880
Oh

782
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:07,840
How do we eat it? Oh

783
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:10,640
No, well, I'm just standing next to it

784
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:14,160
I definitely saw that

785
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:18,640

786
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Seven I uh

788
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:30,640
Oh, is it in here?

789
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:47,680
Well, we were on the roller coaster. I saw she be standing over a dead. I was running over to the bow

790
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:49,680
Oh

791
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:00,800
No, I'm I'm a vulture. I'm just eating

792
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:16,720
I'm a vulture whatever I ate two bodies

793
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:19,280
They're very delicious

794
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:30,400
No, I'm sorry

795
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:36,320
What what happens if I get voted off and I'm a vulture, I don't know what happens

796
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:42,080
Well later

797
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:45,600
I'm dead

798
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:49,040
I

799
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:51,360
Did anything happen?

800
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:55,040
I'm uh, should be got killed

801
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:58,800
Yeah, does it tell you whether or not she wish you

802
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:02,160
She's just a vulture

803
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:08,480
We tell you what

804
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:11,120
I was a vulture

805
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:15,280
Who's the what their thing is? Oh my gosh, it's bubble tea

806
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:21,120
It's azu and um, you have to like look at the person and it'll tell you who it is

807
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:29,360
She is snacking I'm just like, uh, gotta eat these chocolate covered peanuts

808
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:32,880
What?

809
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:36,560
I must I must I must discuss. What is the lover?

810
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:40,080
Naio is the only one with her

811
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:42,720
There's only one duck

812
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:46,560
I was achieving that moment and now she reads that

813
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:58,080
The fact that it's not naio is actually really surprising

814
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:08,880
I'm gonna get

815
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:11,120

You are my always my favorite snake girl

818
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Are you surprised? Bye

01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:40,880
Why did she vote herself out?

823
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:45,200
Naio, why did you vote yourself out?

824
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:48,320
Wait, uh, um, I don't understand

825
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:51,040
I am

826
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:53,040
Oh, why do you vote yourself out?

827
01:22:54,160 --> 01:22:57,840
Um, I think I did it by you know, ever

828
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:04,240
It's not azura because she was with me

829
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:06,880
Exactly

830
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:21,280
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Tommie was the Canadian

831
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
No, no this last round, wasn't it?

832
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:28,160
Oh, well, she wasn't it this year. No, I'm she's been two rounds where Tommie is

833
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:32,660
Yelling at me that she is the canadian do not touch me in the canadian one was a

834
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:40,000
Okay, you thought it was me, but maybe it's Azura?

835
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,400
As it was really good, this game.

836
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:42,400
No, no, no, wait!

1047
01:46:53,900 --> 01:46:58,380
I didn't even kill I was just minding my own business waiting for my moment and then tomomi

1048
01:46:58,780 --> 01:47:02,620
Then maro ran away. We're about to do a double kill because she did it too early

1049
01:47:07,180 --> 01:47:12,700
It's it's tomomi then it's you tomomi. You self-reported. I mean I got that

1050
01:47:20,700 --> 01:47:26,060
I thought I could I thought I could do the deflects where I blame my teammate and then somebody else

1051
01:47:28,380 --> 01:47:32,780
Please let me speak. Okay. This is this is kind of funny. It's not really funny. Um, I'm gonna be honest

1052
01:47:33,260 --> 01:47:36,140
I've done all the killing and you guys blame. She both of my

1053
01:47:48,940 --> 01:47:50,940
Just walked by

1054
01:47:58,460 --> 01:48:00,460
Tomomi

1055
01:48:12,060 --> 01:48:15,580
I didn't even kill anybody I literally

1056
01:48:17,660 --> 01:48:23,260
Yeah, but I didn't I didn't act on my murderous urges. I didn't act on my murderous urges

1057
01:48:29,020 --> 01:48:33,900
No, no, but still guys. No guys tomomi. It wasn't lying. I I literally didn't kill any of you guys

1058
01:48:36,700 --> 01:48:38,700
Every time

1059
01:48:38,940 --> 01:48:43,580
I happened to walk by and I was like we weren't even like like maro

1060
01:48:43,980 --> 01:48:49,020
Uh, I was trying to get maro to do a double team with tomomi, but she ran away too fast

1061
01:48:49,660 --> 01:48:51,660
And then I got blamed for it

1062
01:48:51,980 --> 01:48:56,860
Cause they died as soon as your body was on top of their body. Yeah. No, I like how it looked

1063
01:48:56,940 --> 01:48:59,980
I saw it happen and I'm like, oh great. Yeah. Yeah. Oh great

1064
01:49:00,700 --> 01:49:03,260
Tomomi just messed up. I forgot her hair. Tomomi

1065
01:49:05,820 --> 01:49:11,660
When tv god spell I I felt her heart, you know being hurt. I feel her anger

1066
01:49:13,100 --> 01:49:16,780
No, because it was true. I was so angry because I didn't even kill love

1067
01:49:16,780 --> 01:49:21,180
I didn't have to say I do have to say mercy. I promise and serenity can vouch

1068
01:49:21,420 --> 01:49:25,100
She wanted to die because she wanted me to weekend at bernie's her. So I didn't kill her

1069
01:49:25,420 --> 01:49:29,180
She was what she wanted. I wouldn't have done. Okay. That's what you want. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm like

1070
01:49:30,700 --> 01:49:35,020
And I said if you're the killer, can you weekend up bernie is my body like put me somewhere funny?

1071
01:49:36,620 --> 01:49:38,620
I wish you could move the body around

1072
01:49:39,500 --> 01:49:41,980
If you could move bodies, that would be a very interesting dynamic

1073
01:49:43,340 --> 01:49:45,340
I got scared

1074
01:49:46,300 --> 01:49:48,700
I need to be a duck again so I can be redeemed

1075
01:49:51,660 --> 01:49:53,660
I blame

1076
01:49:55,660 --> 01:49:57,660
I just wanted to vote it out

1077
01:49:59,740 --> 01:50:01,740
Why

1078
01:50:15,500 --> 01:50:17,500
It's quite fitting

1079
01:50:19,020 --> 01:50:21,020
Any other role which is surprising

1080
01:50:30,540 --> 01:50:32,540
I'm scratching my eye

1081
01:50:41,340 --> 01:50:43,340
Oh

1082
01:50:46,220 --> 01:50:48,220
I'm turning them on

1083
01:51:01,100 --> 01:51:03,100
This might be my last game because I have to go

1084
01:51:06,860 --> 01:51:09,660
How can you can eat people but it's not you're not an evil

1085
01:51:11,980 --> 01:51:13,980
Oh my god, boy, she's picking her mic with her

1086
01:51:14,220 --> 01:51:19,180
Yes, and it's really I know PTT would be so funny. I might try to put that together

1087
01:51:23,420 --> 01:51:25,420
Please let me be a duck. I'm an Avenger

1088
01:51:32,540 --> 01:51:34,540
Avengers assemble

1089
01:51:35,260 --> 01:51:37,260

Wait, what the hell are you guys whispering about?

1102
01:52:36,700 --> 01:52:38,700
I actually

1103
01:52:39,100 --> 01:52:42,860
Well, I'm scared to tell you guys sign. Tell me what she is, but I'm scared to tell you guys because I don't know who you are

1104
01:52:43,100 --> 01:52:45,820
I'm an Avenger. I'm trying to duel my other Dodo

1105
01:52:46,860 --> 01:52:49,820
Oh, you should be doing things then dude. If you're dueling

1106
01:52:50,540 --> 01:52:52,540
You're gonna die. I'm gonna die

1107
01:52:53,820 --> 01:52:55,820
Yeah, you're dueling

1108
01:52:56,940 --> 01:52:58,940
Well

1109
01:53:00,140 --> 01:53:02,140
Oh, how you guys doing

1110
01:53:02,300 --> 01:53:04,140
I want to

1111
01:53:04,220 --> 01:53:06,220
Are you guys what are you guys's roles?

1112
01:53:07,260 --> 01:53:09,260
Roll

1113
01:53:13,660 --> 01:53:17,740
I am an Avenger and I'm forming a team

1114
01:53:19,900 --> 01:53:23,900
Good luck with that. I have to read you guys don't want to join the Avengers

1115
01:53:24,700 --> 01:53:26,700
No

1116
01:53:33,980 --> 01:53:43,020
Wait, if I can temporarily kill people after I witness a murder then does that mean then does that mean what?

1117
01:53:54,140 --> 01:53:56,140
What do you mean from when are you literally okay?

1118
01:53:59,100 --> 01:54:03,180
Yeah, I was in communications talking to rain and I was like, can you help me can you help me find

1119
01:54:04,140 --> 01:54:06,140
And I was like I like rain's voice

1120
01:54:09,340 --> 01:54:13,020
And I saw him walking away from the body directly and also I'm the detective

1121
01:54:13,260 --> 01:54:20,220
So if you somehow get out of this, I'm gonna fucking be on your ass. Okay, so you wait

1122
01:54:24,460 --> 01:54:26,960
I was just wasn't I just Maro in a cacune

1123
01:54:38,860 --> 01:54:40,860
Oh, okay

1124
01:54:51,500 --> 01:54:53,500
Uh, I believe that's probably Tomomi

1125
01:54:54,220 --> 01:54:58,540
I bet some of me is not a detective. She's the dodo self report. I'm a skip

1126
01:54:59,580 --> 01:55:01,580
Same

1127
01:55:04,220 --> 01:55:06,220
Is that what it's called

1128
01:55:11,660 --> 01:55:16,940
Don't worry, don't worry. I'm an Avenger. So if I witness your murder if I witness your murder, I can avenge you

1129
01:55:21,580 --> 01:55:23,580
Hello, oh, thank you

1130
01:55:24,860 --> 01:55:26,860
All right, we got to go find Maro

1131
01:55:27,660 --> 01:55:33,100
And so I can if she murders somebody I could witness the murder and I can avenge and I think that means I can kill the murderer

1132
01:55:33,740 --> 01:55:38,860
I sign on a sheriff. So I can just I could just fucking kill her. Oh wait, you can

1133
01:55:42,300 --> 01:55:44,300
All right, she has a gun

1134
01:55:48,540 --> 01:55:50,540
What you do when I'm me

1135
01:55:50,540 --> 01:55:52,540
I

1136
01:55:53,420 --> 01:55:55,420
Mean are you alive?

1137
01:55:59,100 --> 01:56:01,100
Let's see if I can line up with her

1138
01:56:03,260 --> 01:56:05,260
What are you doing?

1139
01:56:06,780 --> 01:56:09,020
What are you doing your eafk?

1140
01:56:10,220 --> 01:56:14,620
I was astral projecting apparently. What are you like a psychic or something?

1141
01:56:15,580 --> 01:56:22,060
I think so I can use my spirit to go through walls, but I can't see like oh, okay

1142
01:56:23,500 --> 01:56:29,820
Okay, I think I think you're good then that's pretty cool. I know I know I had to do the I had to do a task there

1143
01:56:30,220 --> 01:56:34,220
One of you guys kill somebody so that I can avenge them and kill you

1144
01:56:38,860 --> 01:56:40,860
Oh, hi, I want to go on this thing

1145
01:56:45,100 --> 01:56:47,100
Wait a second

1146
01:57:01,820 --> 01:57:03,820
She did say that to me

1147
01:57:03,980 --> 01:57:05,420
yeah

1148
01:57:05,420 --> 01:57:10,860
If because you know about this game if I'm the detective and I scan someone and there's like a little angry face next to them

1149
01:57:10,860 --> 01:57:13,180
Does that just mean that they killed or does it also mean they're a bad guy?

1150
01:57:13,420 --> 01:57:15,420
It just means they killed someone

1151
01:57:17,340 --> 01:57:19,340
I think serenity

1152
01:57:19,740 --> 01:57:21,740
I think serenity is good

1153
01:57:21,900 --> 01:57:27,500
We were close we were walking around together alone for a while and I'm an avenger and we were just like, okay

1154
01:57:27,500 --> 01:57:29,500
We're gonna go kill mero

1155
01:57:30,060 --> 01:57:34,140
That sounds bad, but um that was the safest way to do it anyway. Yeah

1156
01:57:34,780 --> 01:57:37,980
So I think yeah, I I think I think serenity is I

1157
01:57:39,340 --> 01:57:41,340
Yeah

1158
01:57:43,500 --> 01:57:50,700
She literally told me she was the sheriff as soon as the game started. Okay, and I told you who I vote. Do I just skip you trust

1159
01:57:51,980 --> 01:57:56,540
Okay, so does that mean it was not the serenity is not a good liar? So yeah

1160
01:57:59,820 --> 01:58:05,020
She's really not a good liar. No, it just means she wasn't a who's the one person that voted. Okay. Okay. Okay

1161
01:58:06,620 --> 01:58:09,260
Azura's mighty quiet. Naya's mighty quiet

1162
01:58:09,260 --> 01:58:11,260
Wow

1163
01:58:12,460 --> 01:58:14,460
Uh-huh

1164
01:58:17,340 --> 01:58:19,340
All right, kakune

1165
01:58:19,420 --> 01:58:21,420
What just happened wait, what just happened?

1166
01:58:23,260 --> 01:58:25,260
Who is in there? Hello?

1167
01:58:25,660 --> 01:58:30,940
Well, who's in the thingy? Oh, it's azura. It's azura

1168
01:58:33,180 --> 01:58:37,740
Wait, it's definitely not me. No, I meant like it's azura like she's here

1169
01:58:38,460 --> 01:58:40,460
Like uh, it's azura

1170
01:58:41,020 --> 01:58:46,380
If you do kill somebody I'm just gonna wait for it to happen. So uh, you can't I can avenge them

1171
01:58:51,740 --> 01:58:55,180
How do we fix the lights? Oh, are they across the way? You have to go to the teleporter. Yeah

1172
01:58:56,780 --> 01:58:58,780
Oh wait, there's a teleporter

1173
01:59:01,500 --> 01:59:05,900
Oh ain't that nifty right where's the lights? Oh, did somebody already fix them?

1174
01:59:06,860 --> 01:59:08,860
Yes

1175
01:59:09,020 --> 01:59:12,300
If you'd kill me she'd be I'm I'm just the Avenger bro

1176
01:59:13,580 --> 01:59:15,580
I'm captain america

1177
01:59:15,580 --> 01:59:17,580
I have america's ass

1178
01:59:17,900 --> 01:59:19,900
I'm looking for I'm looking for a dead

1179
01:59:21,260 --> 01:59:23,260
Oh, not a dead body. I'm looking for someone to avenge

1180
01:59:24,940 --> 01:59:26,940
What

1181
01:59:27,500 --> 01:59:29,500
Is

1182
01:59:32,380 --> 01:59:34,380
Uh, okay, then it's probably naya

1183
01:59:34,700 --> 01:59:37,820
I think azura might be fine because I was alone with her for a bit

1184
01:59:37,820 --> 01:59:42,620
But she might have been biding her time and marinating me. Um, I'm gonna find naya

1185
01:59:46,060 --> 01:59:48,220
Where's naya she must be on the other side still

1186
01:59:48,220 --> 01:59:50,220
I

1187
01:59:55,020 --> 01:59:57,020
Don't know

1188
02:00:01,100 --> 02:00:03,100
Where's the life support

1189
02:00:05,100 --> 02:00:07,740
Of course, it's across the way I bet

1190
02:00:09,660 --> 02:00:13,340
It is isn't it? Oh, hopefully somebody figures that out

1191
02:00:13,660 --> 02:00:15,660
Oh

1192
02:00:17,180 --> 02:00:23,980
Where how do we get over there? Oh, I'm gonna watch you we got to get over there to the ship

1193
02:00:29,660 --> 02:00:31,660
Uh-huh

1194
02:00:31,660 --> 02:00:33,660
I

1195
02:00:42,780 --> 02:00:46,140
Amazing job detective amazing job

1196
02:00:59,180 --> 02:01:01,180
I got a skedaddle

1197
02:01:01,260 --> 02:01:06,780
But it's been really fun. Thank you for inviting me to this really fun collab. I wish I could stay longer

1198
02:01:07,980 --> 02:01:09,980
Bye everybody kisses

1199
02:01:24,140 --> 02:01:26,140
Discord

1200
02:01:31,900 --> 02:01:33,900
I

1201
02:01:38,220 --> 02:01:40,700
I've been like I gotta go feed my cat. Um

1202
02:01:41,740 --> 02:01:47,020
That was fun. I like the addition of the more roles. It's just like it's funny because like

1203
02:01:47,660 --> 02:01:49,660
I used to play a lot of town of salem

1204
02:01:50,140 --> 02:01:55,260
Um, and then like among us came out and it's like, oh, this is moving around town of salem with extra stuff

1205
02:01:55,660 --> 02:02:00,700
And now like there's goose goose duck which is really I'm happy these things are like free because this is a this is a really fun game

1206
02:02:01,260 --> 02:02:02,940
um, I definitely um

1207
02:02:02,940 --> 02:02:09,740
Play with those girls again. It's so funny. I think it makes sense actually to have a larger group for this just because the maps are so huge

1208
02:02:10,540 --> 02:02:11,980
um

1209
02:02:11,980 --> 02:02:15,820
Whereas for like among us like it makes sense to have like just eight people or whatever the heck

1210
02:02:16,940 --> 02:02:18,620
excuse me

1211
02:02:18,620 --> 02:02:20,620
Yeah, I know there's like a town of salem too

1212
02:02:22,380 --> 02:02:27,740
But yeah, everybody's so cute as geese. Yeah, it's super fun. I'm super tired. Um

1213
02:02:28,380 --> 02:02:31,500
So I'm gonna go feed the baby the baby fia

1214
02:02:32,220 --> 02:02:37,740
My kitty cat and I'm gonna literally just like pass out boomi is sitting next. Well, he's not sitting

1215
02:02:37,740 --> 02:02:43,980
He is knocked out himself in the cat bed on my desk. Um, I just realized that there's icing on my

1216
02:02:45,580 --> 02:02:52,140
Ring light that's cute. Uh, I also I just keep finding cake pieces in random places by the way. It's really fun

1217
02:02:53,020 --> 02:02:59,020
It's like cake in my bathroom. There's cake in my closet. I don't even know how it got there. There's cake everywhere

1218
02:02:59,740 --> 02:03:01,740
um

1219
02:03:03,180 --> 02:03:07,820
But uh, it's literally I just noticed that it's like what the heck

1220
02:03:08,380 --> 02:03:13,740
Because it had it at an angle and then I think boomi must have bumped it when he walked over so no I could see it

1221
02:03:15,500 --> 02:03:20,540
The non-members don't know they don't know. Um, but I'm glad you guys enjoyed

1222
02:03:20,620 --> 02:03:27,340
Um, it is uh my day off tomorrow. So I'll probably I'll be getting like a lot of stuff down and record some stuff

1223
02:03:28,140 --> 02:03:29,660
um

1224
02:03:29,660 --> 02:03:31,500
Yeah

1225
02:03:31,500 --> 02:03:35,900
I've been watch I've been binge watching the uh the kingdom the last kingdom on netflix

1226
02:03:36,220 --> 02:03:38,620
Because I've been on like a vikings-esque kick

1227
02:03:39,420 --> 02:03:42,620
And I'm like, yeah, it's okay. Uh, are you doing anything monday?

1228
02:03:42,700 --> 02:03:48,540
So we're doing the members stream monday that will be I call it member mondays or

1229
02:03:48,940 --> 02:03:55,500
Doing a megan a stupid little doll horror movie watch along and I'm gonna wear the heart rate monitor again

1230
02:03:56,140 --> 02:03:57,740
um

1231
02:03:57,740 --> 02:04:03,180
But I don't do I only have the members stream? I think so. It might be just the members stream

1232
02:04:03,900 --> 02:04:07,420
Um, but yeah, no, I've never seen that movie. It looks really dumb

1233
02:04:08,060 --> 02:04:13,100
So and I hate how hyper realistic the doll is so I maybe I'll actually be scared

1234
02:04:14,060 --> 02:04:16,060
Uh, yes 4 p.m

1235
02:04:16,700 --> 02:04:18,700
4 p.m. Member mondays

1236
02:04:20,060 --> 02:04:25,100
Will you hold me during the movie you get scared easy? You're gonna be scared of a little doll. Are you sure?

1237
02:04:25,980 --> 02:04:27,980
You probably cried during anvil

1238
02:04:28,700 --> 02:04:32,300
It's the best kind of dumb. I heard it was like surprisingly an okay movie

1239
02:04:34,860 --> 02:04:38,300
I won't be scared. I know I'm probably just gonna be sitting there just being like, what is this?

1240
02:04:39,820 --> 02:04:41,820
I'm not projecting

1241
02:04:42,060 --> 02:04:44,060
Uh

1242
02:04:45,660 --> 02:04:51,740
I liked that I walked past rain and she was talking about liking chocolate bunnies and I was like yelp

1243
02:04:53,100 --> 02:04:55,180
That was a lot of good clips and moments in this

1244
02:04:55,420 --> 02:04:57,420
I hope somebody makes the highlights out of it

1245
02:04:57,980 --> 02:05:04,860
With that'll be a lot of work with the multiple povs. Um, it's also really cool being able to hang out with um

1246
02:05:05,980 --> 02:05:11,580
The v and u girls, uh, I don't often get to do that. Um, I think that was my first

1247
02:05:12,540 --> 02:05:14,540
collab

1248
02:05:15,420 --> 02:05:17,180
I might be wrong

1249
02:05:17,180 --> 02:05:22,460
These are blur, um, and then just like some new people like I didn't know that we had spanish speakers

1250
02:05:22,460 --> 02:05:24,460
So that was pretty cool. Um

1251
02:05:26,060 --> 02:05:28,060
And then yeah, it's a lot of really cool people

1252
02:05:28,860 --> 02:05:36,860
Um, it sucks that like irie irie's internet just went out and then reya couldn't make it because uh, she wasn't feeling well

1253
02:05:37,180 --> 02:05:44,140
The poor jote. Yeah first v and u collab. Yeah, I've talked to serenity like outside of like an online collab

1254
02:05:44,220 --> 02:05:45,820
That's why I got confused

1255
02:05:45,820 --> 02:05:47,820
um really briefly, um

1256
02:05:48,780 --> 02:05:49,820
But it was cool

1257
02:05:49,820 --> 02:05:56,780
I think it's really nice doing collabs and stuff because I think again it shows people that velar is pretty normal

1258
02:05:57,100 --> 02:06:05,180
Like I'm sitting here and I'm expecting this very say so collab and people are just like farting and like swearing and being like

1259
02:06:05,500 --> 02:06:08,780
Like before before call. There's so many innuendos and I'm like

1260
02:06:09,980 --> 02:06:11,980
What collab is this?

1261
02:06:13,100 --> 02:06:17,740
I'm like, I know I wasn't gonna be like I thought I was in the horpo. What's happening here, but it's

1262
02:06:19,180 --> 02:06:25,260
Um, but it was I think it shows people that were just very very chill. Um

1263
02:06:25,900 --> 02:06:30,620
It's I'm I try to really behave myself in um collabs not that

1264
02:06:31,420 --> 02:06:35,580
Yeah, it's not hard to do though. Like I'm I'm a pretty well behaved person

1265
02:06:36,780 --> 02:06:38,780
I'd like to say

1266
02:06:39,340 --> 02:06:41,340
you know

1267
02:06:41,340 --> 02:06:43,340
Just your regular

1268
02:06:44,060 --> 02:06:47,660
I think my favorite thing is just hearing imi just scream my name

1269
02:06:48,540 --> 02:06:50,540
That sounds really weird out of context would just be like

1270
02:06:52,700 --> 02:06:57,580
Just like she gets so panicked and it's so funny. Oh my god. No, it's not

1271
02:06:58,540 --> 02:07:03,180
Ah, you have to like shout over her. It's so funny. I like shout over some of them

1272
02:07:03,340 --> 02:07:06,460
She's like very it's like she immediately starts panicking and yelling

1273
02:07:07,020 --> 02:07:12,300
And then as there is this like I just wanted you dead. I'm like, yo, okay. Damn was there

1274
02:07:13,180 --> 02:07:15,180
It's coming at me

1275
02:07:15,180 --> 02:07:17,180
um

1276
02:07:17,180 --> 02:07:21,980
For no reason. I'm just sitting here minding my lonesome checking you guys out

1277
02:07:22,540 --> 02:07:26,860
Um, but lots of yeah, it was fun. I like the carnival map. It was pretty cool

1278
02:07:27,980 --> 02:07:29,980
Oh

1279
02:07:31,500 --> 02:07:36,220
Hardest line she ever dropped. I got so hurt. I got shot through the heart

1280
02:07:38,460 --> 02:07:39,820
Um

1281
02:07:39,820 --> 02:07:45,420
Yeah, as there as there like locks in during these games. She's very as her is just a good gamer to be honest

1282
02:07:46,060 --> 02:07:49,740
Um, I think she hides her power level in that regard

1283
02:07:50,380 --> 02:07:57,260
It's like certain games like certain like like like uh competitive games. She's like very very good at um

1284
02:07:58,300 --> 02:08:00,300
Do you give love a bad name? I'd hope not

1285
02:08:02,300 --> 02:08:04,300
Yeah, she is a menace

1286
02:08:04,620 --> 02:08:06,620
menace

1287
02:08:07,580 --> 02:08:13,340
Uh, and the mercy was funny too. I really wanted to get mercy when I was the duck and when she was like

1288
02:08:14,140 --> 02:08:18,220
She'd be hypothetically. Um, what if I was the

1289
02:08:20,140 --> 02:08:24,860
The kill it out. I wish I could have turned around be like no mercy. Don't and then she'd be like

1290
02:08:25,660 --> 02:08:27,660
And there's like get her

1291
02:08:27,740 --> 02:08:32,460
Uh, but yeah, mercy just screaming. She like laughed for like two minutes straight

1292
02:08:33,020 --> 02:08:33,980
brain

1293
02:08:33,980 --> 02:08:35,740
brain

1294
02:08:35,740 --> 02:08:41,660
Uh, there's definitely a lot of clippable moments definitely a lot of clippable moments. I really wish um

1295
02:08:42,140 --> 02:08:46,380
Strani was in the stream because again, I love strani in these types of games

1296
02:08:47,340 --> 02:08:51,740
She's just me screaming and I just got like she's just like a like ivy. She's just like ivy

1297
02:08:52,300 --> 02:08:56,380
Um, it's so funny mercy and serenity. They're so like

1298
02:08:57,500 --> 02:09:00,540
Literally joined at the hip. I love their friendship so much

1299
02:09:01,180 --> 02:09:02,540
um

1300
02:09:02,540 --> 02:09:08,060
I hope that I can build a friendship like that with somebody. I feel like I'm on my way with building

1301
02:09:08,780 --> 02:09:11,100
friendships with some of the girls that close

1302
02:09:11,900 --> 02:09:13,420
um

1303
02:09:13,420 --> 02:09:19,020
Obviously, obviously I'm close to the viewer girls. I mean like outside of the company. Uh, so it'll be really cool

1304
02:09:19,980 --> 02:09:24,220
Although it's funny my dad. I went out he like called me before he went to the movies

1305
02:09:24,700 --> 02:09:30,460
And he's like I was talking about I'm like, yeah, I have a collab today and then uh,

02:10:48,220 --> 02:10:49,580
And I'm like

1324
02:10:49,580 --> 02:10:52,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, bro. Whatever

1325
02:10:53,740 --> 02:10:55,740
I'm a gamer. You're a gamer

1326
02:10:56,460 --> 02:10:58,460
You can't treat me this way

1327
02:10:58,620 --> 02:11:03,100
And like before he hung up. He's like, you know, I don't I'm not trying to like kill you or anything

1328
02:11:04,700 --> 02:11:09,020
He's like, you know, even though you don't live under my roof anymore. I'm still your father and I was like

1329
02:11:09,740 --> 02:11:14,940
Okay, yeah, you're right. I have to go outside. He's like a support for your mental and I'm like, yeah

1330
02:11:15,500 --> 02:11:19,180
Okay, then I'll go for a walk or something

1331
02:11:19,820 --> 02:11:22,780
There's a park nearby my house. So maybe I'll walk to the park

1332
02:11:23,420 --> 02:11:24,860
um

1333
02:11:24,860 --> 02:11:31,660
250 literally I have I have caught on my computer and I'm gonna uninstall it because it's like swallow. I think it's like

1334
02:11:33,100 --> 02:11:35,100
ridiculously swallowed up one of my

1335
02:11:35,420 --> 02:11:37,420
my uh hard drives

1336
02:11:37,420 --> 02:11:39,420
or my ssd

1337
02:11:42,860 --> 02:11:49,500
Like yeah, what do you expect at work from home? Like it's like I'm a I'm a streamer. I'm a niche internet celebrity dad

1338
02:11:50,300 --> 02:11:52,300
okay

1339
02:11:52,540 --> 02:11:57,820
All right, and I might be doing things so I can support fias medical bills. Okay

1340
02:11:59,980 --> 02:12:01,980
um

1341
02:12:02,220 --> 02:12:04,220
Finally we get some maybe I'll do a

1342
02:12:04,300 --> 02:12:07,420
Twitter space and be like hey you guys are coming on a walk with me

1343
02:12:07,900 --> 02:12:12,540
Maybe that'll be good actually because it is true. Like I have been like cooped up in my house a lot

1344
02:12:13,100 --> 02:12:16,540
Um, I am hanging out with friends soon like going out to lunch with them

1345
02:12:16,540 --> 02:12:21,900
But again, it's different because again, I used to have hobbies where I'd be like hiking or I'd be doing jiu-jitsu

1346
02:12:22,060 --> 02:12:24,060
Or I'd be outside gardening with my mom

1347
02:12:24,540 --> 02:12:29,020
But just because I've been really isolated. I haven't really felt the need to go outside

1348
02:12:29,980 --> 02:12:31,980
So I'm like awkward

1349
02:12:32,940 --> 02:12:35,820
But like I definitely need to do that because I don't have anything to do anything

1350
02:12:36,060 --> 02:12:37,500
anyone let like

1351
02:12:37,500 --> 02:12:42,620
Like the people I would normally hang out with to do those things like I just really don't talk to anymore. So

1352
02:12:44,860 --> 02:12:45,900
Um

1353
02:12:45,900 --> 02:12:50,300
Honestly, this is not bad, but it's it's not that bad, but my dad knows me very well

1354
02:12:50,460 --> 02:12:52,940
He he knows that I need to go outside and touch grass

1355
02:12:53,580 --> 02:12:55,580
Uh, because sometimes it's like oh

1356
02:12:55,980 --> 02:13:01,100
It's not good for me personally to like isolate for so long. Not that I'm doing it on purpose

1357
02:13:01,180 --> 02:13:03,580
It's really that I've been so busy and that's what I explained to my dad

1358
02:13:03,580 --> 02:13:07,020
I'm like, I'm just really really busy and I'm like, hey man

1359
02:13:07,100 --> 02:13:11,420
I hate you up so we could go out and watch Deadpool. All right, so like I'm trying here

1360
02:13:11,900 --> 02:13:13,900
Because I'm a terrible communicator

1361
02:13:15,180 --> 02:13:17,180
And I hate texting people

1362
02:13:17,660 --> 02:13:19,660
Or just communicating in general

1363
02:13:20,540 --> 02:13:22,380
I'm just

1364
02:13:22,460 --> 02:13:24,460
I this time again, I'm an introvert

1365
02:13:24,860 --> 02:13:28,700
And I was way more of an extrovert when I worked at my sales job

1366
02:13:28,780 --> 02:13:31,740
But now since I work from home and I just talk on the internet

1367
02:13:32,540 --> 02:13:34,700
I can just be back to my introvert itself

1368
02:13:35,980 --> 02:13:37,980
And it's great

1369
02:13:40,380 --> 02:13:46,540
Have you talked to Salem I talked to Salem um and all of yesterday because we were making plans

1370
02:13:47,100 --> 02:13:50,380
Uh, and I was telling them I was up with Fia. Uh, I'm taking out

1371
02:13:51,020 --> 02:13:52,460
All I was getting married

1372
02:13:52,460 --> 02:13:54,460
So I'm taking her out

1373
02:13:54,540 --> 02:13:59,820
To a nice restaurant because I wasn't able to make her bachelorette because I was at my grandparents house

1374
02:14:00,380 --> 02:14:02,540
In florida during her bachelorette weekend

1375
02:14:03,020 --> 02:14:03,980
Which was a bummer

1376
02:14:03,980 --> 02:14:08,620
But I'm also kind of happy that I didn't go because it was on a boat and I would have puked

1377
02:14:09,100 --> 02:14:13,580
Because I'm not good. You guys know I get really freaking motion sick. I probably would have died

1378
02:14:14,060 --> 02:14:16,940
But it looked fun otherwise like there was other parts when they weren't on a boat

1379
02:14:17,020 --> 02:14:18,700
So I'm like, oh

1380
02:14:18,700 --> 02:14:22,380
And I dressed up like the cheetah girls. It was so cute. I'm like, what the hell

1381
02:14:23,500 --> 02:14:28,540
What the heck man is Salem auditioning? I that's why I like I Salem's not gonna audition

1382
02:14:28,620 --> 02:14:32,380
No, Salem's not gonna audition the project that I have working on with her

1383
02:14:33,100 --> 02:14:39,260
Um is going to take a very long time and a like a lot of money because I would I would want her to get like a

1384
02:14:39,260 --> 02:14:44,780
Png youtuber model or I would get her like, I don't know. Maybe I just get our booth model and she could customize it

1385
02:14:45,180 --> 02:14:45,900
um

1386
02:14:45,900 --> 02:14:52,540
Because we wanted to do a podcast together talking about like uh books and stuff our favorite schmottie books, um

1387
02:14:54,540 --> 02:15:00,060
Boomi is hanging off the edge of the bed off my desk because a little pa is touching me. I'm gonna shake your hand. Hello, sir

1388
02:15:01,180 --> 02:15:03,180
Oh

1389
02:15:03,180 --> 02:15:05,580
Oh, she's a good boy today. He was actually no

1390
02:15:06,060 --> 02:15:09,340
You were annoying because you kept trying to steal your sister's food again

1391
02:15:10,220 --> 02:15:12,220
Yeah, I'm talking about you. Um

1392
02:15:13,260 --> 02:15:17,340
But that will take a really long time and I already have another project I'm working on before that

1393
02:15:17,420 --> 02:15:19,740
Um, I haven't had time to talk to Salem

1394
02:15:21,260 --> 02:15:26,540
Because everybody's so busy like now that we don't work together at the same job because me and olive and salem

1395
02:15:26,540 --> 02:15:28,940
I always still work at the same job. Um

1396
02:15:31,100 --> 02:15:33,100
Uh, it's harder to like get together

1397
02:15:33,420 --> 02:15:38,060
Not that like and I'm also just a terrible texture. Like they text pretty fine. I miss a terrible texture

1398
02:15:39,100 --> 02:15:40,220
um

1399
02:15:40,220 --> 02:15:42,220
Call that literature

1400
02:15:42,700 --> 02:15:44,700
I'm stealing that. Thank you. Um

1401
02:15:45,340 --> 02:15:50,940
For me accusations. I was telling my dad about how someone is like just like boomi's lawyer

1402
02:15:52,300 --> 02:15:54,860
And he was dying laughing. He thought that was really funny

1403
02:15:55,100 --> 02:16:00,700
I forgot I wanted to ask him to record a voice message of like to say hi to you guys, but I totally forgot about that

1404
02:16:01,340 --> 02:16:03,020
um

1405
02:16:03,020 --> 02:16:07,580
Maybe it's for the best people probably be like, oh my god, male. Although it's like literally my dad's

1406
02:16:09,420 --> 02:16:12,620
I might just do it with my mom and dad just so people feel okay

1407
02:16:14,860 --> 02:16:16,700
Um

1408
02:16:16,700 --> 02:16:19,580
Yeah, no me and my dad saw Deadpool today. It was great. I

1409
02:16:20,700 --> 02:16:23,180
Blew my expectation. I went with no expectations

1410
02:16:23,900 --> 02:16:28,540
Uh and very low expectations actually but I blew it out of the water. I just

1411
02:16:29,340 --> 02:16:31,340
Oh my god, it made me like

1412
02:16:32,060 --> 02:16:33,420
like

1413
02:16:33,420 --> 02:16:34,940
desire

1414
02:16:34,940 --> 02:16:38,460
rewatching all the x-men movies again, like if I could although they're terrible but like

1415
02:16:39,980 --> 02:16:45,740
Like x uh x-men like the last day. I was the first ever superhero movie I watched so it has this uh,

1416
02:16:46,380 --> 02:16:48,380
A soft spot in my heart

1417
02:16:49,180 --> 02:16:52,220
Spart you guys know what I mean spot. Um

1418
02:16:54,540 --> 02:16:58,940
Yeah, they're really good like and I liked all the nods to like their mess ups

1419
02:16:59,900 --> 02:17:03,500
And past the movie like I'm not looking forward to the next phases

1420
02:17:03,820 --> 02:17:07,660
I was looking forward to Thunderbolts as I mentioned on my twitter and then they

1421
02:17:08,060 --> 02:17:12,220
Totally messed like the casting is trash if they had like Scream and Mimi

1422
02:17:12,860 --> 02:17:14,060
Goliath

1423
02:17:14,060 --> 02:17:15,500
Zemo

1424
02:17:15,500 --> 02:17:19,820
Uh fixture or whatever the heck their names is. I can't remember anymore. Um, because I haven't read the comics a bit

1425
02:17:19,980 --> 02:17:25,820
But I was like, what is this cat? Like they're all it's like taskmaster times three

1426
02:17:25,900 --> 02:17:29,980
They all have the same freaking power like they don't even have any powers. They're all just marksmen

1427
02:17:30,860 --> 02:17:34,860
And I'm like stop age of alternate has made a resurgence as well has it now

1428
02:17:35,820 --> 02:17:41,180
Um, I remember yeah, I saw the trailer for like world war. No not world war hulk. Um

1429
02:17:42,540 --> 02:17:44,540
What is that?

1430
02:17:45,020 --> 02:17:47,020
Falcon movie

1431
02:17:47,980 --> 02:17:52,140
There's a captain almost a captain falcon, um ever get

1432
02:17:53,020 --> 02:17:57,660
Like in the trailer you see a glimpse of red hulk and that is would be the only reason why I would go

1433
02:17:59,660 --> 02:18:01,660
And I'm really surprised that um

1434
02:18:02,460 --> 02:18:08,940
What's his face is in the movie because I felt like he's just like over like I thought he would never ever be in the MCU because

1435
02:18:09,260 --> 02:18:10,380
Yeah

1436
02:18:10,380 --> 02:18:12,460
Yeah, brave new worlds. Thank you. I'm like

1437
02:18:13,260 --> 02:18:15,260
I didn't even finish like

1438
02:18:15,820 --> 02:18:17,420
Falcon

1439
02:18:17,420 --> 02:18:21,500
And that winter soldier like I just didn't even finish that because it was boring to me

1440
02:18:22,540 --> 02:18:23,740
and

1441
02:18:23,740 --> 02:18:25,740
I hated I

1442
02:18:25,740 --> 02:18:27,740
Hated the scrawl

1443
02:18:28,220 --> 02:18:30,220
TV show they had

1444
02:18:30,220 --> 02:18:35,660
Even though Amelia Clark was in it. I'm like I watched two episodes and I'm like this is trash

1445
02:18:36,060 --> 02:18:40,220
I watched like three episodes or four episodes of hawkeye. I'm like I'm bored

1446
02:18:40,700 --> 02:18:43,100
I like all the tv shows just

1447
02:18:43,820 --> 02:18:45,820
Fell off the movies fell off

1448
02:18:46,780 --> 02:18:48,140
um

1449
02:18:48,140 --> 02:18:53,420
Like and like I used to be a freaking huge mc mcu fan like huge huge

1450
02:18:54,060 --> 02:18:55,500
mcu fan

1451
02:18:55,500 --> 02:18:57,900
But I like oh it just is not

1452
02:18:58,700 --> 02:19:01,180
Good and then like I really like Eternals

1453
02:19:02,060 --> 02:19:05,180
Like felt like it was the catalyst of the beginning of the end

1454
02:19:06,140 --> 02:19:12,380
Um, I love the casting the Eternals like got Barry Keegan. He got the dude from uh game of thrones

1455
02:19:12,940 --> 02:19:13,900
he got

1456
02:19:13,900 --> 02:19:14,860
uh

1457
02:19:14,860 --> 02:19:16,460
that one chick

1458
02:19:16,460 --> 02:19:19,500
Whose name escapes me that's been in a bunch of other stuff. She was in

1459
02:19:20,460 --> 02:19:24,140
The creator which was the creator made me ball my eyes out

1460
02:19:24,700 --> 02:19:27,500
Great movie by the way. Holly would recommend watch the creator

1461
02:19:27,980 --> 02:19:29,420
um

1462
02:19:29,420 --> 02:19:33,420
It's all downhill from endgame. I thought they're okay. Like I think I was more around

1463
02:19:33,500 --> 02:19:36,700
I've been if I watched it again and game I'd be like, what is this?

1464
02:19:38,140 --> 02:19:40,300
But like because of the hype and stuff. I think I enjoyed it

1465
02:19:41,660 --> 02:19:43,340
Yeah, I was

1466
02:19:43,340 --> 02:19:45,340
pissed that they recasted

1467
02:19:47,180 --> 02:19:49,180
him as doom to be honest

1468
02:19:49,340 --> 02:19:50,460
Uh

1469
02:19:50,460 --> 02:19:56,300
Just because I would have loved a fresh new face for doom. That's really the only personal reason for me

1470
02:19:57,100 --> 02:19:59,100
and um

1471
02:20:00,300 --> 02:20:03,020
Also seeing how much he's getting paid. I'm like jesus christ

1472
02:20:03,820 --> 02:20:07,580
Uh, I'm curious to see like if they may come some sort of variant

1473
02:20:08,300 --> 02:20:10,300
or if

1474
02:20:11,260 --> 02:20:17,660
It would be super cool if he's a variant like oh, what if stark became doom or something because I'm pretty sure that is like a

1475
02:20:17,740 --> 02:20:19,820
what-if comic? I don't know. Um

1476
02:20:22,060 --> 02:20:24,060
And or

1477
02:20:24,220 --> 02:20:29,980
If he just has the same face and it'll be cool if they like see him and they're just like, oh wait a second

1478
02:20:30,780 --> 02:20:32,780
That looks like

1479
02:20:32,940 --> 02:20:35,980
A stark and then maybe they like I don't know lose their minds. I don't know

1480
02:20:36,460 --> 02:20:39,580
They got him for doom so they can get more people to watch it too

1481
02:20:39,580 --> 02:20:44,860
But like oh like they've already watched it for pager pascal like I'm so excited pager pascals in it

1482
02:20:45,100 --> 02:20:51,820
I don't know. So like I like pager pascal and the invisible woman's actress whose name also escapes me

1483
02:20:51,820 --> 02:20:54,940
I don't know who the other two people are that are in the fantastic four

1484
02:20:55,500 --> 02:20:57,500
um

1485
02:20:57,500 --> 02:20:59,980
I didn't see the fantastic four with the michael b jordan

1486
02:21:00,700 --> 02:21:02,700
Because it looked terrible

1487
02:21:02,700 --> 02:21:04,700
Although I love jamey bell

1488
02:21:05,020 --> 02:21:12,220
Because I really one of my guilty pleasure movies is jumper with hating christensen. I freaking love jumper

1489
02:21:12,220 --> 02:21:14,220
They should make a second jumper movie

1490
02:21:15,660 --> 02:21:17,660
Jumper was so cool

1491
02:21:18,860 --> 02:21:21,340
I remember basing uh, I made like a

1492
02:21:21,980 --> 02:21:26,060
Like I remember I told you guys about like my um young justice fan fiction

1493
02:21:26,460 --> 02:21:31,740
I made another character that was like teleportation the same exact way from like jumper

1494
02:21:32,700 --> 02:21:34,700
Jumper is such a good movie

1495
02:21:35,260 --> 02:21:40,140
No loop the looper is different. There's something called jumper with hating christensen. You're thinking of

1496
02:21:41,340 --> 02:21:45,100
Whatever that dude's name is I was calling paul rudd. That's not the case

1497
02:21:47,980 --> 02:21:49,980
um

1498
02:21:50,140 --> 02:21:52,540
But yeah, no jumper was good and uh

1499
02:21:55,100 --> 02:21:57,100
Yeah, I was just like

1500
02:21:57,180 --> 02:22:00,060
I don't know why but like tenet just popped into my head for whatever reason

1501
02:22:00,060 --> 02:22:01,580
I'm waiting for tenet two to come out

1502
02:22:01,580 --> 02:22:04,620
I've seen tenet like three times and it gets better every time I watch it

1503
02:22:05,100 --> 02:22:07,420
And I don't know why for christopher nola movie

1504
02:22:08,700 --> 02:22:14,540
I think it was scored so low because it was hard to follow. That's why like after the third watch

1505
02:22:14,620 --> 02:22:17,180
I started to enjoy it more. Uh tenet

1506
02:22:20,220 --> 02:22:22,220
If you repeat you

1507
02:22:23,260 --> 02:22:26,540
You don't have to remind me. I know but thank you

1508
02:22:27,420 --> 02:22:29,420
Um, I'll be honest. I wish

1509
02:22:29,820 --> 02:22:34,300
You would stop telling me that I should be doing something when I kind of just want to talk for a moment

1510
02:22:34,860 --> 02:22:39,820
She's fine. So I appreciate it, but you don't have to baby me. I am a grown woman

1511
02:22:41,500 --> 02:22:43,500
I will leave when I need to

1512
02:22:46,780 --> 02:22:49,260
Needing to watch it like three times was my issue

1513
02:22:49,740 --> 02:22:55,660
But like I was just great every time and I can't wait because then the second movie is going to start where the like

1514
02:22:56,300 --> 02:22:59,340
Is going to start at the beginning of the first movie essentially

1515
02:23:01,420 --> 02:23:08,300
Um, it's okay, but I think I've gotten you don't have to remind because I think it also bothers people who enjoy the app

1516
02:23:08,940 --> 02:23:12,940
Uh, I'm aware fia is napping right now. Anyways, I can see her on the couch

1517
02:23:13,900 --> 02:23:16,380
And I have to hold her like a baby to feed her

1518
02:23:19,260 --> 02:23:21,260
Um, but yeah

1519
02:23:21,900 --> 02:23:23,500
I think of

1520
02:23:23,500 --> 02:23:25,820
On him again, I'm excited to see alien romulus

1521
02:23:27,340 --> 02:23:29,340
She's a good poof indeed

1522
02:23:30,060 --> 02:23:34,940
I like I've been having to do this thing. It's she like I literally have to have her like a little baby

1523
02:23:35,020 --> 02:23:41,660
It's like I'm raising a baby because I have to hold her like a baby and bottle feeder or I have to syringe feeder because she can't um

1524
02:23:42,860 --> 02:23:44,860
Eat right now that well

1525
02:23:45,580 --> 02:23:48,460
Because her uh the muscles again are not responding

1526
02:23:48,700 --> 02:23:52,140
But she can like drink and like do other stuff or whatever. She just can't like

1527
02:23:52,700 --> 02:23:54,380
chew

1528
02:23:54,380 --> 02:23:56,380
So I've like literally made like

1529
02:23:57,100 --> 02:24:01,580
Whipped together like pureed her food to the extreme and put it in a syringe

1530
02:24:02,140 --> 02:24:06,860
And then I hold it like a little baby and then I burp her and then I put her in the litter box

1531
02:24:06,940 --> 02:24:08,940
See if she needs to go and then

1532
02:24:09,740 --> 02:24:13,340
I tuck her in and then I like play with a little bit with her

1533
02:24:13,980 --> 02:24:19,740
Oh, yeah, I'm sitting in the theater with my dad watching the trailer for romulus. He's like, I can't watch this

1534
02:24:19,900 --> 02:24:22,620
I can't do it. I'm like dad. He's like

1535
02:24:23,660 --> 02:24:24,700
I hate these movies

1536
02:24:24,700 --> 02:24:30,940
I don't like that because my dad my dad is such a big baby. He's scared of like uh like um

1537
02:24:31,500 --> 02:24:35,020
Any sort of horror movie except for like I think my dad can handle like slasher films

1538
02:24:35,340 --> 02:24:41,420
He was belly laughing so hard in the opening scene. I was like dad, please

1539
02:24:42,460 --> 02:24:46,540
You are perpetuating a certain stereotype and you need to be quiet

1540
02:24:47,020 --> 02:24:51,740
He's like, I just can't help it. It's so funny and I'm like I understand

1541
02:24:55,500 --> 02:24:57,100
Um

1542
02:24:57,100 --> 02:25:03,500
Especially because like my dad's belly laugh sounds like what's his face from the Simpsons sometimes

1543
02:25:06,780 --> 02:25:09,740
Because your life like super high-pitched um

1544
02:25:10,540 --> 02:25:12,540
Um

1545
02:25:15,420 --> 02:25:20,220
My dad does that voice a lot too, you know when he's when I do something stupid. He'll just laugh at me like that

1546
02:25:21,260 --> 02:25:23,260
um

1547
02:25:24,300 --> 02:25:30,060
But yeah, no, it was fun because like I knew there's so oh my god, that's the easter eggs

1548
02:25:30,860 --> 02:25:36,300
The easter. Yeah, Nelson the easter eggs. I was like Nelson, right? Yeah, Nelson, but I didn't say it

1549
02:25:36,860 --> 02:25:42,700
The easter eggs in Deadpool were awesome like me and my dad were like that Leonardo DiCaprio me and we were like, oh

1550
02:25:44,220 --> 02:25:45,340
Um

1551
02:25:45,340 --> 02:25:48,620
If we brought my mom my mom would probably would have fainted from all the gorge

1552
02:25:49,660 --> 02:25:51,660
Uh, the fight choreography was really good

1553
02:25:52,620 --> 02:25:56,780
The the sexual tension between Deadpool and Wolverine was palpable

1554
02:25:57,660 --> 02:26:02,380
During their fight scenes. There's like one part and I think a lot of people cut it

1555
02:26:03,020 --> 02:26:05,340
um like they cut

1556
02:26:05,340 --> 02:26:07,340
and like like they clipped it

1557
02:26:07,820 --> 02:26:08,780
uh

1558
02:26:08,780 --> 02:26:10,460
where their

1559
02:26:10,460 --> 02:26:13,660
Spoilers by the way, although I'm it's in like the trailer

1560
02:26:14,220 --> 02:26:14,940
um

1561
02:26:14,940 --> 02:26:20,540
Then they're fighting in the minivan and he just like gets a little grin on his face when they're fighting

1562
02:26:21,260 --> 02:26:27,020
I remember seeing a tweet someone saying oh he a freak freak and I'm like hell yeah

1563
02:26:27,580 --> 02:26:29,180
um

1564
02:26:29,180 --> 02:26:31,180
But it was funny because it looked

1565
02:26:31,580 --> 02:26:35,020
Like that wasn't scripted like it's very slight that you could see the smile

1566
02:26:35,820 --> 02:26:37,820
uh

1567
02:26:40,220 --> 02:26:44,540
They paid a great homage to the Spider-Man fellow Deadpool's dodges and Wolverine

1568
02:26:45,180 --> 02:26:46,700
um

1569
02:26:46,700 --> 02:26:48,700
it was

1570
02:26:49,180 --> 02:26:51,500
Yeah, that was yeah, they come back and they were like the

1571
02:26:52,220 --> 02:26:56,860
You guys can't see me, but I have my hand. I'm hoping that leads to more Deadpool team-up movies

1572
02:26:57,820 --> 02:27:00,380
There is so much love that was put into that movie

1573
02:27:00,460 --> 02:27:06,700
I could tell like there's again lots of homage like the ending credit scene where they kind of cycle through all the fox 20th century fox

1574
02:27:07,500 --> 02:27:09,500
MCU stuff

1575
02:27:09,500 --> 02:27:15,500
That was really cool to see because you literally just saw all the multiverse behind the scene clips and it was so awesome

1576
02:27:16,300 --> 02:27:17,820
um

1577
02:27:17,820 --> 02:27:20,620
But I really hope that opens up like a Deadpool Spider-Man

1578
02:27:21,100 --> 02:27:26,620
Like it would be it would be so freaking hilarious if it's Deadpool and Tom Holland's Spider-Man

1579
02:27:26,860 --> 02:27:28,860
Or even Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man

1580
02:27:29,500 --> 02:27:34,940
Uh, because you know, there would be like a cameo of like Toby or Andrew Garfield or Tom Holland depending on which one

1581
02:27:35,500 --> 02:27:40,140
And it would be funny if it was Tom Holland because then like Deadpool will just be going around swearing and killing people

1582
02:27:40,220 --> 02:27:44,540
And then you could see Tom Holland's Spider-Man going like no you can't do that like come on

1583
02:27:44,620 --> 02:27:51,180
And like maybe like not doing anything the entire film and then like randomly dropping an f-bomb perhaps like like at the very end

1584
02:27:52,300 --> 02:27:54,780
Or like like like I think that would be so fun

1585
02:27:55,500 --> 02:28:00,220
Um, Andrew Andrew would be perfect out of all of them. Andrew would be the best

1586
02:28:00,700 --> 02:28:06,540
Um, in my opinion. I heard aren't they going to make another spider-man film with Andrew?

1587
02:28:07,500 --> 02:28:09,180
um

1588
02:28:09,180 --> 02:28:12,780
I think because he got like a lot of love from the spider-verse

1589
02:28:13,980 --> 02:28:20,140
Not the spider-verse the you guys multiverse of that. I can't remember. I can't get my stuff together

1590
02:28:20,540 --> 02:28:24,620
I'm excited for the into the spider-verse the next one though because

1591
02:28:25,580 --> 02:28:27,580
damn

1592
02:28:28,220 --> 02:28:32,780
Andrew does deserve a third honestly, I liked Andrew Garfield's spider-man

1593
02:28:33,820 --> 02:28:35,180
uh

1594
02:28:35,180 --> 02:28:38,380
Yeah, no way home. Sorry. I'm like the heck uh

1595
02:28:40,220 --> 02:28:44,700
I am obsessed with the soundtrack of the second movie. I will play

1596
02:28:45,580 --> 02:28:47,580
Electro's theme

1597
02:28:47,740 --> 02:28:49,740
And just get in my head and just be like

1598
02:28:50,780 --> 02:28:55,100
Like it's like dubstep versus like with orchestral and I'm like, oh, I'm so hype

1599
02:28:55,820 --> 02:28:58,860
I even ended up like memorizing all the lyrics and I'll just sing it

1600
02:28:59,740 --> 02:29:02,620
Like I just love Electro's theme. It's so sick to me

1601
02:29:03,260 --> 02:29:05,260
like Hans Zimmer just

1602
02:29:06,380 --> 02:29:08,380
Chef's kiss anything he touches

1603
02:29:09,020 --> 02:29:11,020
turns to gold

1604
02:29:11,580 --> 02:29:16,300
I remember watching like an analysis of him creating like prior to the Caribbean theme and I'm like

1605
02:29:17,180 --> 02:29:20,540
Of course that was Hans Zimmer because I initially didn't know that he scored that

1606
02:29:21,340 --> 02:29:23,420
um, he does and he like

1607
02:29:24,460 --> 02:29:25,900
the

1608
02:29:25,900 --> 02:29:32,140
Like go go. What do you have the chance and just it's eight minutes long listen to Electro's theme

1609
02:29:32,620 --> 02:29:37,260
And it's great or just the scene where um, he like officially becomes electro

1610
02:29:37,820 --> 02:29:40,860
Um, but yeah, no like no way home is also a good movie

1611
02:29:41,660 --> 02:29:43,660
That was a great movie

1612
02:29:43,660 --> 02:29:48,060
I get so nostalgic when I watch certain movies like I wanted to ball my eyes out

1613
02:29:49,180 --> 02:29:50,540
um

1614
02:29:50,540 --> 02:29:52,300
in like the

1615
02:29:52,300 --> 02:29:55,580
Final stretch of the Deadpool Mulvane movie because I'm just like

1616
02:29:56,940 --> 02:30:03,580
This is so I just want to cry everywhere because I was so happy and it just made me so nostalgic

1617
02:30:04,380 --> 02:30:10,380
All these MC movies no ultimate alliance game. That's a good point. There must be some sort of licensing thing

1618
02:30:10,380 --> 02:30:12,380
You think that'd be like place somewhere

1619
02:30:13,660 --> 02:30:19,420
Shibi, how did you understand that one guy whose name I must say you couldn't I don't know I just because

1620
02:30:21,900 --> 02:30:25,820
And it's funny because it's like that actor so it's like 10 times funnier to me

1621
02:30:26,140 --> 02:30:30,940
Although I thought like I it would have been really funny if they brought in

1622
02:30:30,940 --> 02:30:32,940
uh

1623
02:30:33,740 --> 02:30:42,300
X-Men Origins version too like because I like I also really liked that character because of X-Men Origins

1624
02:30:45,100 --> 02:30:49,420
I had a big crush when I was younger on the X-Men X-Men Origins

1625
02:30:49,980 --> 02:30:53,180
Wolverine version of that character. Um

1626
02:30:55,260 --> 02:30:57,660
I also liked him and John Carter because you know

1627
02:30:58,220 --> 02:31:01,340
I told you Maguire was in that too. It was in John Carter. Um

1628
02:31:03,660 --> 02:31:05,500
But yeah, no, it was so funny

1629
02:31:05,660 --> 02:31:08,700
And I don't even remember the context of why they were that character

1630
02:31:08,780 --> 02:31:11,900
Why he was that character because I remember he's always loved that character

1631
02:31:12,300 --> 02:31:15,820
And I can't remember if I like read somewhere. He always begged to be the mcu

1632
02:31:16,300 --> 02:31:18,940
Like if you like just make me him and he finally got it

1633
02:31:21,020 --> 02:31:24,060
But it's like it's it's that actor and it

1634
02:31:25,020 --> 02:31:31,260
He's usually in totally different things, but it's kind of funny. Like this is who he is in the mcu

1635
02:31:32,460 --> 02:31:34,460
Um X-Men Origins. Yes

1636
02:31:34,940 --> 02:31:37,740
Yes, they had like oh my god

1637
02:31:38,380 --> 02:31:39,580
if they had like

1638
02:31:39,580 --> 02:31:46,380
Um, honestly if they had like leave Shriverman or like his name is Shriver left Shriver who played um

1639
