00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,920
Uh-huh. Come inside

367
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,400

Bros. Yeah, this is the real nail tech. There's laura. I told you

369
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,560
What is the nail tech?

370
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:35,200
Where is she? Her name is like mine, but she's so different nails. Please believe I'm real. She'll be gone

371
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,880
What the how do we get out of here? Oh, there's a ladder

372
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,720
This is so crazy. I'm gonna change my shoes. Yeah. Yeah, wait, wait

373
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,200
So

374
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,320
Oh, wait, I just distracted you times. I'm sorry

375
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,880
but in the game there's like

376
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,440
Profile codes that you can go on to people's pro like in the character's profiles

377
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:03,920
And find them so it's like horror game stuff and there's a game where she like tries to chase you like a bunch of them

378
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:10,080
And before around the map there was like a bunch of lanas like the old lady that's in the caves

379
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,160
They're like she would like spawn around the map

380
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,160
So yeah

381
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:19,280
For that is the lore. What is this? Uh, basic bitches

382
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,640
White women

383
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:27,920
I mean, I guess I guess you can't be happier than that. They're like a cute lesbian couple and that's why they're happy. I don't know

384
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:37,520
They look kind of they look kind of pouty. I have no idea what I said. I'm sorry. Oh my god. It's yuji itadori from yuji tukaisu

385
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,520
Oh

386
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:47,280
Actually, I'll give you a floor for that just because I think he lives because just because it's it's itadori

387
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:53,760
Oh, yeah, I guess he I don't know. I've never seen yuji tukai jinn. It's really gourd

388
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,760
Five stars

389
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,280
I give you four stars because you're like kind of naked

390
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:11,520
But your feet are out. So that's like that's what gave you four. I gave her five stars for feet. I love your feet

391
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,440
Ty, I want to like rub our feet together. Oh my god

392
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,880
Okay, this is

393
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,760
Bunch bombs totally happy

394
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,680

Oh, that's pretty cute. I'll give you a floor for that

400
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:51,600
Okay, I'll be I like it. It's a very easy one stars because the pink is kind of out of place in my opinion

401
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,280
So I'm being technical

402
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000

00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,520

00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,840

00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,800
Can I please get out of this pose?

436
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,320
Just click it again

437
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,320
Latina

438
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,320
No, I can be Latina

439
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,040
You were always Latina in my eyes

440
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:42,800
Thank you. Okay, my team studio is making me upset at a bit of rage

441
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:48,160
I just closed out of it. It was just crashing too much. I think it was breaking my road box

442
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,160
Stupid

443
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,760
It's so stupid. I know how it's supposed to be creative if you can't

444
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,400
I can't

445
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,480
Sure. No, I don't I don't like if you guys watch too hot to handle

446
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,360
What is that?

447
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,400
I have never watched it before

448
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,800
But I know it would be right up my alley

449
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,520
Wait, what is that?

450
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:17,360
It's a that like original like reality show

451
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,840
Uh and it's about like these really hot people that go on

452
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,960
and they

453
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,520
Oh are like really horny

454
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:31,120
But they're not allowed to kiss each other or touch each other

455
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,760
And if they kiss or touch each other then

456
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,360
There's like a prize pool like at the end that they can win

457
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:42,000
But if anyone kisses or touches each other then it takes money out of the prize pool

458
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,680
But because they're so horny they like can't resist

459
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,400
each other

460
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,960
And like you kind of just watch people suffer I guess

461
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,880
I'm gonna ask in like a nice way

462
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,960
I think I gave it really bad this good

463
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,640
No, no, that was like

464
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:03,600
I just loved how you were talking about it because you're just like I'm sure of yourself

465
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,480
I thought you were explaining it

466
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,360
It's very cute

467
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,360
I just I'm just so

468
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:19,280
People watch shows like that. Yeah, that's why I love love island

469
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:26,560
Dude, I watch like love island blilly and like like kid cartoons. I'm watching paul patrol. No, that's like my thing right now

470
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,560
It's paul patrol

471
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,560
I have too much hair on

472
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:35,440
There's a hot little bit on it right now. So I'm inspired

473
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,680
But I also love blilly

474
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,600
I love lily

475
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:47,040
Blur is great. You guys should watch uh paul patrol

476
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:51,520
No, I'm not gonna I watch the paul patrol movies and that's as far as I'm taking that

477
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,920
What the fuck

478
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,440
The movie is good

479
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:01,600
I'm not gonna watch the show because it's got a cop dog named chase in it. I ain't I ain't about that. That's actually pretty

480
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:07,760
Actually, actually the the cop dog is like the least favorite. No one likes the cop dog

481
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,080
That's what they push him the most because he has the least sales

482
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,040
Yeah, because he's the worst

483
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,200
Yeah, he sucks. I don't like it either

484
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:20,560
Like he was the main character for the first movie and I don't understand why they decided to do that

485
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:22,400
Really?

486
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:26,560
But luckily they they they changed their ways for the second movie. Thank thank god

487
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,720
Fuckin

488
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,960
I wonder if you and chai will become muppets

489
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:32,960
Um

490
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,960
I'd like to be a muppet that sounds like a fun hobby. I like the muppet movie a lot

491
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,600
I love the muppet movie. Which one?

492
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,920
uh

493
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,600
Like the muppet movie the new one that came out with walter

Oh, like the office was british before they made an american version

567
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:45,280
Yeah, though spanish version is way better because she actually kind of looks in my opinion a little unattractive

00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:50,240
But the action is very beautiful. Do I just want to keep playing this or do you want to play um

It's I'm helping you

790
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:16,000
I'm just kidding. It wasn't light yagami. It was a gender met version

791
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:18,560
Yeah, she's just coping now coping

792
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:19,360
Come on

793
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:21,360
What the fuck is that? Is this a

794
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:22,400
Oh

795
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:23,360
Double McRae?

796
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:25,920
Gojo, that's a gojo. That looks more like Dante

797
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:27,920
Is this my gojo?

798
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,800
It looks more like Dante

799
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:36,240
I mean, yeah, this looks like Dante, like what?

800
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:39,360
That looks like Dante

801
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,320
Oh, lol, I mean, buddy

802
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:48,160
I can't believe it. That's pretty good. This person definitely plays like every single day of their life

803
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:51,280
It's not fair. I had a good

804
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:54,080
It's not fair

805
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,320
I had a good trip

806
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:01,920
If we ever want we can just make up our own theme and then we can just dress up however we want

807
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:07,040
Wait, is this the girl from avatar? Oh avatar. Yeah, well a bit of lego

808
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:13,840
I don't know why they didn't just do the pattern skin. I remember when I was little

809
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:16,400
I thought people with little lego had like a skin disease

810
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:19,280
So I didn't want to touch them because I got scared that I would get it to

811
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:26,560
I've never met anyone in person. Oh my god. Oh my god. At least at least marie, please

812
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:29,520
Yeah

813
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:32,800
Or do you want to go to the next game?

814
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:38,640
I'm kind of mad at dress for impress honestly. I had a really good country track

815
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:44,800
I saw you dressing up green. I was wondering what you were going with

816
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:49,040
I was going for cunty track. Okay. What's the spooky thing you said?

817
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:52,720
Um, we could play doors doors

818
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:57,840
Yeah, I watch a more video about doors, but I totally forget what it's about

819
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:04,240
We could play doors. Do you want to play doors? I've beaten doors before. I'm very good at it

820
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:06,240
Now we need to play doors. Okay, uh

821
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:15,120
I got to door 91 before I died so that made me really sad. I want to play more dress to impress later

822
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:23,360
I didn't know this would be so fun. Okay, everyone's going back on. It's very exciting. We can play after three. Yeah

823
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:28,960
Yeah, we can. I don't mind. Wait, my face is all fucked up in the game. So just um, I'm jumping steeby

824
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:32,720
Yes, I said hi to the yay

825
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:36,720
I'm jumping up. I didn't know that she raided. I feel bad

826
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:41,200
Let's see. I only saw her in chat and I hot girl wrenched her

827
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:46,480
You hot girl wrenched her? Yeah. Yeah, we're playing doors. No

828
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:50,640
Oh, yeah, vc mute your vc. Uh, your vc by the way

829
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:53,680
People are talking in the game. Why do I?

830
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:57,840
What did you

831
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:03,840

833
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,480
Wait, wait type in the game. She'd be typing the game really quick

834
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,400

835
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:30,080

836
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:33,760
Nah, I'm sigma

837
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:39,200
I know my big sign above my head. It took it off of you. It strips you

838
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,960
Wait, I don't see sound controls at all

839
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:50,240
Can I please I look horrifying. How do I how do I become small like you?

840
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:56,640
You have to buy it. What? Wait, look at me though. Look at me though. You look very cute too. Try what the hell

841
01:13:57,680 --> 01:14:02,720

842
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:07,040
I'm shaking my butt

843
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:12,720
There you are

844
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:14,720
You

845
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:21,680
Really inappropriate about your robux avatar

846
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:23,440
I have like

847
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:27,760
Say it say it to my face. I want to I want to do disgusting things to like if I was a guy

848
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:33,360
I would grab you by the neck and just start pounding into you. Oh your face is every passing week

849
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:39,280
And then I would take you to dinner at your favorite restaurant. I would treat you very nicely

850
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:44,800
Take me to dinner before you treat me like an ono hole, please. Okay. Yeah priorities

851
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:51,840
Priorities, I'm gonna make the the lobby guys. So tall friends only one two. Wait. How much how many are there?

852
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:55,520
Oh, thank god, there's only four

853
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:03,520
Okay, you guys should be able to join me join me quick in the wait in elevator 29 elevator 29. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

854
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:07,840
At the bottom right there should be a thing where you can join me like friends

855
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:10,640
Oh guys

856
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:13,520
Okay

857
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:21,440
So how do you play this because I would teach you some things so

858
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:27,280
Um, I'm gonna give you guys like the sound cues because I know for like the first two times

859
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:33,840
It's really hard. So there's a monster called rush and what he will do is he will essentially

860
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:37,200
Yeah rush you the flights will flicker and you'll hear like

861
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:40,560
The lights will switch to flicker. Once the lights flicker

862
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:43,040
um

863
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:46,480
You have to hide into a closet. So if you don't hide in a closet in time you die

864
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:49,520
I don't I don't think I I don't

865
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,760
uh, but

866
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:57,280
Oh, no, I think I think I feel like we can probably just teach them as we go. Why are you a giant man now?

867
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:00,400
Yeah, it makes you sad

868
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:02,720
What your face is so funny

869
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:09,440
Who mari with her big body? I feel that's mean

870
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:12,480
I'm insecure

871
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:16,880
So, also by the way just as a fair warning if you open up a lot of drawers

872
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:19,280
A little monster will come up and like attack you

873
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:24,080
Okay, I'm not gonna do anything. Okay, I got the I got the key. I got it. Just follow

874
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:27,600
Wait, wait try try try wait wait try try

875
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:31,360
Thanks boy, you guys do have to catch up though. Like they

876
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:36,640
Do I have a big body or do I have like a hot sexy body?

877
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:40,480
You have a big body, but it is so hot and sexy.

878
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:45,600
But Shibi has a hot sexy body, how come I didn't get a big body?

879
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:52,320
Because we're little, so we don't get hot sexy, oh by the way, if you hide in the closet

880
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:55,800
for too long, a monster will start to kill you, so don't just go down the way.

881
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:57,840
So I'm literally just going to stand here then.

882
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:00,440
No, no, no, it's not tiny.

883
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:06,040
Let them learn as we play because it won't make any sense if you try to explain it before anything happens.

884
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:08,200
Okay, I think the key's in the next room.

885
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:12,120
What are we, what are we, what's our objective?

886
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:14,600
We just have to keep going through the doors essentially.

887
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:16,360
Yeah, we're trapped in a hotel.

888
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:19,480
The goal is just to get to the last door, that's all.

889
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:21,400
But it just gets harder and harder.

890
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:22,920
Yeah.

891
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:24,200
There's a lock on this one.

892
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:26,280
Wait, there's a fish on the wall.

893
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:27,320
Wait, guys, where'd you go?

894
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:28,440
Okay, I got scared.

895
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:30,600
We're looking for the key for the top of the door.

896
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:33,320
I am baby ducking so hard right now.

897
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:34,040
I'm having money.

898
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:36,120
It's okay, we'll protect you.

899
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:37,800
I don't believe that.

900
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:39,560
Wait, is anyone else getting a little bit dizzy?

901
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:44,440
I am getting a little bit motion sick doing all this.

902
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:48,360
Yeah, okay, if we die, we don't have to play this, we can play a different game.

903
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:49,320
I'm so sorry.

904
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:51,240
I didn't know, I didn't think that into it.

905
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:52,120
I didn't know either.

906
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:54,120
No, no, no, I was only starting the key.

907
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:55,560
I love being dizzy.

908
01:17:56,360 --> 01:17:58,360
Oh.

909
01:17:58,440 --> 01:17:59,320
That's a little weird.

910
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:03,400
Yeah, why is our people walking so tilty?

911
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:08,280
It's because it's like, if we're being, it's called immersion.

912
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:08,920
Oh, shit!

913
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:11,400
Look down, look down, look down, look down, look down, look down, look down.

914
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:12,440
Look down, look down, look down.

915
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:13,720
What am I looking down?

916
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:15,560
Six, because you're gonna die if you don't.

917
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:15,880
Okay.

918
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:18,520
Oh, can I look up?

919
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:19,640
Can I look up?

920
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:20,760
Yeah, can I look up now?

921
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:23,240
Wait, okay, there you guys are.

922
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:24,280
Where is she now?

923
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:25,960
I'm right behind you.

924
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:26,760
Oh, oh, oh.

925
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:27,720
Okay.

926
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:31,240
Cute girls doing horror things.

927
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:33,240
Can we need to go up the stairs?

928
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:34,360
No, no, no, no.

929
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:35,560
I'm sticking close to them.

930
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:37,320
Our next, our next door is seven.

931
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:39,240
So look for door seven.

932
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:40,760
Found it.

933
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:42,600
Seven.

934
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:43,880
I like the rain sounds.

935
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:45,880
I, I do too.

936
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:48,200
It's really well like made, made that.

937
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:50,760
I can't believe this is Roblox.

938
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:55,640
I have to rewatch that game theory video on doors.

939
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:56,520
Nine.

940
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:57,960
That was very good.

941
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:00,360
Oh, are we going in order?

942
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:01,400
Yeah, you have to.

943
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:02,920
There's a candle if anybody wants it.

944
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:04,360
What's it do?

945
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:04,920
It'll do.

946
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:06,200
This just gives you light.

947
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:06,920
Ten.

948
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:07,320
All right.

949
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:07,960
I'll hold on to it.

950
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:08,200
Okay.

951
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:10,440
Paintings.

952
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:12,280
Oh, yeah.

953
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:14,520
So wait, can I give a little debrief?

954
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:15,880
Maybe like a video?

955
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:16,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

956
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:17,640
Wait, I'll stop doing that.

957
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:20,680
So there you go.

958
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:22,760
So basically in this game,

959
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:25,000
you just want to keep going to the next door.

960
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,760
Like they're counting up,

961
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:28,600
but the farther that you go,

962
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:30,680
the harder it is to get through.

963
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:33,880
So there's going to be like puzzles and monsters

964
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:37,240
and like little like tasks that you have to do

965
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:38,600
to like be able to get through.

966
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:39,800
Oh, okay.

967
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:40,520
And yeah.

968
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:41,320
What's this one?

969
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:42,680
Is it happy with the paintings?

970
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:43,720
Yeah.

971
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:44,520
So that's what's here.

972
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:46,680
It's like, oh, you have to place the paintings

973
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:48,600
to match the shape behind it.

974
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:53,400
Oh, I want to see it.

975
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:56,360
The green border around the border.

976
01:19:57,480 --> 01:19:57,980
Oh.

977
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:00,600
Tongue, tongue, tongue.

978
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:02,440
And then if you see a locked door,

979
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:04,120
you want to like search for a key

980
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:05,400
within the other.

981
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:07,000
I found a key.

982
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,040
Yeah, it'll come.

983
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:09,880
Good job.

984
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:10,520
You did it.

985
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:14,920
I'm super, oh, this is scary.

986
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:16,120
I don't like this big open.

987
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:16,600
Oh, what?

988
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:17,160
What?

989
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:18,840
Illuminal space.

990
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:19,240
But it's.

991
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:20,600
No, no, no, get out of the closet.

992
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:21,640
It's not time yet.

993
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:23,000
I was opening it

994
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,520
because I thought I could look inside,

995
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:25,640
but it just put me in there.

996
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:25,880
Wait.

997
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:26,920
OK.

998
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:28,200
Go in the closet.

999
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:28,760
Go in the closet.

1000
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:29,320
Go in the closet.

1001
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:32,760
I can't.

1002
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:35,240
I don't think so.

1003
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:38,520
I stole the closet from Chai.

1004
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:41,320
I stole the closet from you.

1005
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:43,320
OK, now you can get out.

1006
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:45,320
It's about to happen.

1007
01:20:46,280 --> 01:20:46,920
Sorry, guys.

1008
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:47,560
Motherfucking.

1009
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:47,880
I apologize.

1010
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:49,240
I haven't been looking at chat as much.

1011
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:51,800
I've been really so locked into Roblox.

1012
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:52,840
I got hit by a bug.

1013
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:54,920
OK, you can get out the closet now.

1014
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:56,600
No, the lights flickered.

1015
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:57,160
I got scared.

1016
01:20:57,160 --> 01:20:57,800
I got worried.

1017
01:20:57,800 --> 01:20:59,320
Are we on 13 or 14?

1018
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:00,920
Be careful not to go through the door.

1019
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:02,040
You can hear the door.

1020
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:02,840
Oh, no, you can't.

1021
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:04,040
I missed the raid from you.

1022
01:21:04,040 --> 01:21:04,760
I feel bad.

1023
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:06,600
When you play solo,

1024
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:08,120
the door is grumble for you.

1025
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:09,400
So sit.

1026
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:10,280
OK, who wants it?

1027
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:11,400
I already got hit by something.

1028
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:12,200
So who wants to go?

1029
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:13,160
What?

1030
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:13,960
Open the door?

1031
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:15,320
I can see you at this door.

1032
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:15,960
No, no, no, no.

1033
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:16,600
Oh, it's 14.

1034
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:17,160
It's 14.

1035
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:18,440
Oh, OK.

1036
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:19,160
I mean, don't do it.

1037
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:19,800
I just.

1038
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:20,920
There's a cage.

1039
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:21,720
I don't.

1040
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:22,760
I don't want to be grabbed in the face.

1041
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:23,560
I look for a lever.

1042
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:24,360
It's OK.

1043
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:25,480
I can look for it.

1044
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:27,720
I look for the lever.

1045
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:28,280
It's OK.

1046
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:29,320
I'll do it for the preview.

1047
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:31,080
I usually am a little bit more engaged, though.

1048
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:33,080
So I still wanted to apologize.

1049
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:33,640
I got it.

1050
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:34,920
We can go back up sails now.

1051
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:36,440
Yay.

1052
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:39,080
The forest must be explored.

1053
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:40,360
Where are the monsters?

1054
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:41,640
I'm not scared.

1055
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:43,400
Yeah, I am.

1056
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:45,240
This one is more like a puzzling one.

1057
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:47,560
Like, there's no little horror.

1058
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:48,440
It'll come soon.

1059
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:50,920
You keep saying that,

1060
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:52,520
and it's making me anxious.

1061
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:54,440
What is it?

1062
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:54,680
I.

1063
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:57,880
It'll come soon.

1064
01:21:57,880 --> 01:21:58,440
What is this?

1065
01:21:58,440 --> 01:21:59,160
Yeah, he was.

1066
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:01,640
It's well designed,

1067
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:02,840
and does it look good?

1068
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:05,640
Oh, it's it's stressful.

1069
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:08,520
I don't like that answer.

1070
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:10,360
OK, that's 17.

1071
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:11,880
OK, get in the closet.

1072
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:12,360
Get in the closet.

1073
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:12,760
Get in the closet.

1074
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:13,320
Get in the closet.

1075
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:13,880
Get in the closet.

1076
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:17,800
I'm in a closet.

1077
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:21,240
Everyone in?

1078
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:21,640
Yep.

1079
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:22,760
I'm making sure he's not coming.

1080
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:26,520
Are they going to have to tear it up like this?

1081
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:27,240
Yeah.

1082
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:28,440
Oh, fuck, I'm dead.

1083
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:30,040
Something's in front of me.

1084
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:31,320
That was me.

1085
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:32,040
OK, I died.

1086
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:32,840
I'm going to come back though.

1087
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:36,840
Wait, where do you find games?

1088
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:39,240
I died, but I'll come back.

1089
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:39,880
Get out the closet.

1090
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:40,600
Now you're safe.

1091
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:41,880
OK, I can't get out.

1092
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:42,760
Oh, why?

1093
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:44,120
If there's a door.

1094
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:45,800
I'm coming.

1095
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:46,360
I'm coming.

1096
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:46,840
I'm coming.

1097
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:48,200
How do I light it?

1098
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:49,720
I don't like this.

1099
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:51,400
Have you put a candle?

1100
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:52,520
I'm going to be honest.

1101
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:53,000
I have.

1102
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,680
I spoke to you, so don't laugh.

1103
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:56,200
How do I light the candle?

1104
01:22:57,560 --> 01:22:58,440
I'll keep you safe.

1105
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:00,040
How do I light the candle?

1106
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:00,920
I don't know.

1107
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:02,040
E.

1108
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:02,680
Guys, am I ahead of you?

1109
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:03,400
I'm pressing E.

1110
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:04,200
I'm pressing one.

1111
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:07,000
Yeah, press one and then click.

1112
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:09,560
It's not letting me.

1113
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:10,520
It says I can't.

1114
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:11,960
Guys, what door are you on?

1115
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:13,880
Maybe you need to have a.

1116
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:15,080
I don't know.

1117
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:17,240
We're at blood.

1118
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:18,440
That's what you're at.

1119
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,120
OK, I respond.

1120
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:23,800
That's why we're at 17.

1121
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:25,800
Oh, I'm at 19, I think.

1122
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:27,960
We'll come back.

1123
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:29,480
OK.

1124
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:34,920
It's OK.

1125
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:36,600
Guys, guys, this way.

1126
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:37,800
It's because it's telling you where to go.

1127
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:39,400
OK.

1128
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:40,840
Wait, put my flashlight.

1129
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:41,240
Awesome.

1130
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:41,400
Come on.

1131
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:43,080
Come this way.

1132
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:43,640
Yeah, yeah.

1133
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:46,040
You guys are silly.

1134
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:46,360
Come on.

1135
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:46,760
Wait.

1136
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:49,160
I'm just screaming, scaring my cat.

1137
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:51,960
I can't do nothing.

1138
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:53,160
This way, this way.

1139
01:23:53,160 --> 01:23:54,200
Let's go together.

1140
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:56,760
Is there a way to interrupt the game volume?

1141
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:58,280
We are just never going to answer B ever.

1142
01:23:58,840 --> 01:23:59,240
What?

1143
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:01,400
Everyone.

1144
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:01,560
What?

1145
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:02,600
What did you say, shy?

1146
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:03,000
Escape.

1147
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:05,320
The game volume.

1148
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:05,800
I just thought.

1149
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:07,640
I'm just going to slow it by your head.

1150
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:08,200
I'm sorry.

1151
01:24:09,240 --> 01:24:09,560
Yeah.

1152
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:12,200
Oh, wait.

1153
01:24:13,160 --> 01:24:14,280
OK, look down again.

1154
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:19,160
Did you just pssst at me?

1155
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:21,720
Come on, then.

1156
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:23,160
I did it.

1157
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:23,560
Look up.

1158
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:24,040
Are you dead?

1159
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:25,320
I'm not dead.

1160
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:26,840
I'm almost dead.

1161
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:27,640
Oh, God.

1162
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:28,920
Did you hear the knock?

1163
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:29,400
Yeah.

1164
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:31,160
Yeah, guys, you can look up now, guys.

1165
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:33,000
No, I don't think I want to.

1166
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:33,720
I don't think I want to.

1167
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:34,200
Look up.

1168
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:36,200
It's OK.

1169
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:36,760
Look up.

1170
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:37,240
Look up.

1171
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:37,880
It's OK.

1172
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:38,920
Look up.

1173
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:40,280
It's dark.

1174
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:42,120
I'm almost dead.

1175
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:43,880
Where's Chai?

1176
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:44,360
See me?

1177
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:47,720
Keep looking for him.

1178
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:48,520
Wait, where's Chai?

1179
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:50,040
He's bringing my ear.

1180
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:51,240
I don't like it.

1181
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:52,920
Wait, I'm waiting for guys.

1182
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:53,560
Wait for Chai.

1183
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:55,240
Where's Chai?

1184
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:57,080
I don't think guys went ahead without me.

1185
01:24:57,080 --> 01:24:59,800
Stevie, why are you trying to walk ahead?

1186
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:01,480
I'm trying to find Chai.

1187
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:04,760
Something keeps psssting at me.

1188
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:07,640
Yeah, yeah, he does it a lot.

1189
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:08,120
I'm dead.

1190
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:10,120
Chibi, Chibi, why are you dead?

1191
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:11,000
What happened?

1192
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:11,720
I got pssst.

1193
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:14,760
Are you got pissed?

1194
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:16,280
I got pissed.

1195
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:18,360
I got pissed too, because I didn't hear him.

1196
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:19,160
And let's go, guys.

1197
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:21,320
Alex, hold on.

1198
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:22,680
Wait, can you respawn?

1199
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:24,680
Or Chibi's gone forever and always?

1200
01:25:24,680 --> 01:25:26,440
Look for it and stare it down.

1201
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:31,080
No, I'm afraid of eye contact.

1202
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:31,720
Look down again.

1203
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:34,520
And walk.

1204
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:35,640
Just walk around him.

1205
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:38,440
Oh, he's got all eyes.

1206
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:39,800
He's literally all eyes.

1207
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:40,600
That's fun.

1208
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:43,000
I don't know how to do it.

1209
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,040
How do I come back?

1210
01:25:45,080 --> 01:25:46,200
Oh, you have to buy it.

1211
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:47,480
Okay, I'll just sit here.

1212
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:49,000
Are you spectating?

1213
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:49,960
Can you spectate?

1214
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:51,800
I'm spectating.

1215
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:52,360
Told mom.

1216
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:55,080
Okay, I'll be.

1217
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:56,920
I'm a big, great dog.

1218
01:25:56,920 --> 01:25:57,240
I'm living through.

1219
01:25:58,120 --> 01:25:59,400
I'm a big, brave dog.

1220
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:01,960
I'm a big, brave dog.

1221
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:05,320
I'm a big, brave, like, brave, like.

1222
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:06,520
I'm alive.

1223
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:07,160
I'm a pretty, brave, like, brave.

1224
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:08,840
Can we go back to Drasztu and pray?

1225
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:10,920
Can we go to, like,

1226
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,200
Can we play a prank?

1227
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:13,880
Can we do the bomb game?

1228
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:15,640
Yeah, we can play past the bomb.

1229
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:17,320
Get in the locket.

1230
01:26:17,320 --> 01:26:17,800
Yeah.

1231
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:21,000
Can I just go try?

1232
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:24,760
No, I think I accidentally did.

1233
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:32,840
Okay, well, let's, the boys must be exploring.

1234
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:34,120
No, I want to leave.

1235
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:37,240
The dog, I thought the monkey was with us.

1236
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:38,440
She's got so scared.

1237
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:40,440
She's, she got that dog in her.

1238
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:43,400
It's a banana, you know.

1239
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:44,040
It's okay.

1240
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:44,520
It's okay.

1241
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:47,000
Well, he's got to get to the library,

1242
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,200
and then we'll, then we'll be done.

1243
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:49,800
Okay.

1244
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:50,840
Try.

1245
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:53,640
Hi, CB.

1246
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:57,240
Oh, no, I'm being pissed.

1247
01:26:58,600 --> 01:26:59,400
She's looking at us.

1248
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:01,000
Ready to carry us to victory.

1249
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:02,280
Thank you, she's mine.

1250
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:03,080
Look, now we're in the light.

1251
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:04,440
How many doors are there?

1252
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:06,120
That's up to 100.

1253
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:08,040
I think there, yeah.

1254
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:10,760
There's a lot, there's a lot to go through.

1255
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:12,840
It's, it gets really intense.

1256
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:14,840
Yeah, it's a lot to get hiding.

1257
01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:18,280
No, no.

1258
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:20,200
Yes.

1259
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:21,080
Okay, I have a lock pick.

1260
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:21,880
Let's just go to the door.

1261
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:25,720
Mario looks so funny.

1262
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:26,600
I can't lie.

1263
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:27,960
I know, it's really creepy.

1264
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:32,520
Like a football player.

1265
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:35,640
I feel like a football player.

1266
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:38,120
I'm keeping everyone safe and sound.

1267
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:39,960
Two of us have died.

1268
01:27:41,160 --> 01:27:41,560
Okay.

1269
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:43,560
Well, that's not my fault that you died.

1270
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:44,280
Okay.

1271
01:27:44,280 --> 01:27:45,160
Technically it is.

1272
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:46,920
Nuh-uh.

1273
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:47,480
Little bit.

1274
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:49,320
Daddy.

1275
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:54,520
And O-T-P-O-G-O.

1276
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:55,000
T-O.

1277
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:58,280
You take me hot.

1278
01:27:58,280 --> 01:27:59,480
Oh, yeah, that's right.

1279
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:03,000
So, uh, what do you, what do you mean this part?

1280
01:28:03,640 --> 01:28:04,120
He comes.

1281
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:07,080
What do you mean he comes?

1282
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:07,800
He comes.

1283
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:08,600
He approaches.

1284
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:09,160
He comes.

1285
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:10,120
You'll see him soon.

1286
01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:11,160
What are you?

1287
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:11,720
What do I see?

1288
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:12,680
A bunch of eyes.

1289
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:14,280
Eyes coming.

1290
01:28:15,480 --> 01:28:16,920
I wish he wouldn't.

1291
01:28:17,640 --> 01:28:19,160
I hope we have protection.

1292
01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:21,160
He's gonna come.

1293
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:22,760
Okay, so how good are you at direction?

1294
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:24,680
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1295
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:27,960
Get him over for me!

1296
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:31,160
How good are you at directions?

1297
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:33,720
Like what kind of direction?

1298
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:35,080
This is gonna be really emotional.

1299
01:28:35,080 --> 01:28:36,120
He's feeding my cat.

1300
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:38,120
What?

1301
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:38,920
Okay, good to know.

1302
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:39,640
Let's go.

1303
01:28:39,640 --> 01:28:41,640
Yay!

1304
01:28:41,640 --> 01:28:42,640
He's coming for you.

1305
01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:44,640
He's having a little snack.

1306
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:45,640
She's right.

1307
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:46,640
Aye.

1308
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:47,640
Aye, Tomah.

1309
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:48,640
What is that?

1310
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:49,640
Run.

1311
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:50,640
Tomah, just run.

1312
01:28:50,640 --> 01:28:52,640
Just run and crouch.

1313
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:54,640
Follow the blue eye, Tomah.

1314
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:55,640
No!

1315
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:57,640
Oh my god, I can't believe it.

1316
01:28:57,640 --> 01:28:59,640
What is with this awesome music?

1317
01:28:59,640 --> 01:29:01,640
I like Tomah.

1318
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:03,640
I am so funny.

1319
01:29:03,640 --> 01:29:05,640
I had to see Tomah.

1320
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:06,640
Oh, I know.

1321
01:29:06,640 --> 01:29:08,640
Are you start eating Tomah?

1322
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:19,640
Oh my god, Tomah's dead.

1323
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:28,640
I don't want to play.

1324
01:29:30,640 --> 01:29:31,640
Neither do I.

1325
01:29:31,640 --> 01:29:32,640
Neither do I.

1326
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:33,640
I'm good.

1327
01:29:34,640 --> 01:29:37,640
I don't play horror games.

1328
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:40,640
You want to play five of the bomb?

1329
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:43,640
Yeah, okay.

1330
01:29:43,640 --> 01:29:46,640
Okay, you guys want to play a nice one.

1331
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:47,640
A nice one.

1332
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:48,640
A nice one.

1333
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:49,640
Okay, let me just die.

1334
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:50,640
Let me just die.

1335
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:51,640
I can't just leave.

1336
01:29:51,640 --> 01:29:52,640
Sorry.

1337
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:54,640
The game and you won't allow it.

1338
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:56,640
I'm not leaving.

1339
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:58,640
Tomah, come here.

1340
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:00,640
Tomah, come here.

1341
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:02,640
Tomah, I'm screaming.

1342
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:03,640
I was just laughing.

1343
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:05,640
I put so bad on the side.

1344
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:08,640
Why are the lights flickering?

1345
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:10,640
I'll die to this.

1346
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:12,640
I don't want to.

1347
01:30:12,640 --> 01:30:15,640
What is that in the corner?

1348
01:30:15,640 --> 01:30:17,640
I left.

1349
01:30:17,640 --> 01:30:19,640
I don't want to know no more mystery.

1350
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:21,640
I'll die to this.

1351
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:26,640
I don't want to know no more.

1352
01:30:26,640 --> 01:30:30,640
I don't want to know no more mysteries, guys.

1353
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:32,640
Do you want to play past the bomb now?

1354
01:30:32,640 --> 01:30:39,640
My instincts are too strong for this game.

1355
01:30:39,640 --> 01:30:41,640
Why am I scared of a Roblox game?

1356
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:42,640
Get me out of here.

1357
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:45,640
Because it's scary, Chibi.

1358
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:47,640
The other one that I wanted to play was worse than this,

1359
01:30:47,640 --> 01:30:49,640
so now I know that we're not playing anymore.

1360
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:51,640
What was the other one?

1361
01:30:51,640 --> 01:30:52,640
It's really bad.

1362
01:30:52,640 --> 01:30:54,640
It's really scary, actually.

1363
01:30:54,640 --> 01:30:55,640
It made me panic.

1364
01:30:55,640 --> 01:30:57,640
What's it called?

1365
01:30:57,640 --> 01:30:59,640
It's like a butcher game,

1366
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:01,640
and I'm going to say,

1367
01:31:01,640 --> 01:31:04,640
do you want to play past the bomb or cake off?

1368
01:31:04,640 --> 01:31:06,640
What are you doing in cake off?

1369
01:31:06,640 --> 01:31:07,640
Is it actually cake off?

1370
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:09,640
It's like dressed in prespo of cakes.

1371
01:31:09,640 --> 01:31:12,640
Yes, please, please, all under the cake line.

1372
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:14,640
Let's do the cake.

1373
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:16,640
And then we can do past the bomb.

1374
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:18,640
No, we're not doing it.

1375
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:20,640
Go away, go away, Harold.

1376
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:23,640
Past the bomb, past the bomb.

1377
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:26,640
Why don't you want to past the bomb with me?

1378
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:27,640
I'm so sorry.

1379
01:31:27,640 --> 01:31:30,640
I'm just trying to snuggle with my cat and just recover.

1380
01:31:30,640 --> 01:31:32,640
I mean, I need to get a care bear.

1381
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:34,640
Hold on.

1382
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:37,640
Jesus Christ.

1383
01:31:37,640 --> 01:31:39,640
Well, you guys were so brave.

1384
01:31:39,640 --> 01:31:40,640
I'm so proud of you, though.

1385
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:42,640
Yeah, we can do casual.

1386
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:44,640
Are you doing me?

1387
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:46,640
I thought this was a kids' game.

1388
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:47,640
No.

1389
01:31:47,640 --> 01:31:48,640
Yeah, I thought this was a kids' game, too.

1390
01:31:48,640 --> 01:31:50,640
Oh, my God.

1391
01:31:50,640 --> 01:31:52,640
Just do that.

1392
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:54,640
Okay, nice.

1393
01:31:55,640 --> 01:32:01,640
She, she, she surprises us with like another horror game.

1394
01:32:01,640 --> 01:32:03,640
It's actually not cake off.

1395
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:05,640
No, I wouldn't do that.

1396
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:07,640
That's me.

1397
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:12,640
You guys actually sound scared and I feel kind of bad.

1398
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:14,640
Oh, my heart.

1399
01:32:14,640 --> 01:32:19,640
I think it's because it's late and I had caffeine and my body is just.

1400
01:32:19,640 --> 01:32:21,640
And I'm drinking vodka.

1401
01:32:21,640 --> 01:32:23,640
Oh, you know.

1402
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:25,640
We are going to cake.

1403
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:27,640
Slash.

1404
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:30,640
We're going to cake, ladies.

1405
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:32,640

1406
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:34,640
Everything is happy.

1407
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:36,640
Yeah, I see it.

1408
01:32:36,640 --> 01:32:39,640
Once you sense it, bountiful harvest of birthday party.

1409
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:44,640
Once she used me like an ono hole before she buys me dinner.

1410
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:47,640
Doesn't even offer me breakfast.

1411
01:32:47,640 --> 01:32:48,640
I'll offer you breakfast.

1412
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:49,640
I can make you a breakfast.

1413
01:32:49,640 --> 01:32:52,640
I want like a traditional Dominican breakfast because I can make that for you.

1414
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:54,640
That would be pretty good.

1415
01:32:54,640 --> 01:32:57,640
What's a traditional Dominican breakfast like?

1416
01:32:57,640 --> 01:33:06,640
Um, mango, salami, uh, yucca, uh, avocado and egg fried cheese.

1417
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:07,640
Hmm.

1418
01:33:07,640 --> 01:33:12,640
Can I just have scrambled eggs with a little bit of salt and a little bit of pepper?

1419
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:14,640
Yes.

1420
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:15,640
Thank you.

1421
01:33:15,640 --> 01:33:18,640
You can totally scramble my eggs, by the way.

I'm so excited.

1429
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:32,640
I'm going to do something a little bit different.

1430
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:35,640
Actually, no.

1431
01:33:35,640 --> 01:33:38,640
We're just going to be basic.

1432
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:39,640
Slide borders.

1433
01:33:39,640 --> 01:33:40,640
Wait, the game is loading.

Why not?

1445
01:33:52,640 --> 01:33:53,640
Words don't need to be spelled correct.

1446
01:33:53,640 --> 01:33:54,640
How do I age?

1447
01:33:54,640 --> 01:33:55,640

know or a quiet that's fine it's turn you out I don't think it's

1533
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:07,920
I don't think it's you

1534
01:40:10,920 --> 01:40:11,920
Drifty?

1535
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:13,920
Those look like poop

1536
01:40:13,920 --> 01:40:15,920
That looks like just poop

1537
01:40:20,920 --> 01:40:23,920
She can't see what I'm saying to her

1538
01:40:23,920 --> 01:40:25,920
What is she saying?

1539
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:27,920
Nothing

1540
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:31,920
You mind your business, babe

1541
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:33,920
You know, I like this, I'm submitting it

1542
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:35,920
I'm almost done, mine

1543
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:37,920
Wait, I feel like this could be really fun

1544
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:40,920
If you knew how to do it properly

1545
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:42,920
Me

1546
01:40:44,920 --> 01:40:46,920
There you are

1547
01:40:48,920 --> 01:40:50,920
I need to go up

1548
01:40:50,920 --> 01:40:52,920
Okay, I'm gonna submit

1549
01:40:52,920 --> 01:40:54,920
Come back, come back, come back

1550
01:40:54,920 --> 01:40:56,920
I'm submitting

1551
01:40:57,920 --> 01:40:59,920
Wait, wait, wait

1552
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:01,920
Oh, blueberry

1553
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:06,920
Oh, this is so cute

1554
01:41:06,920 --> 01:41:08,920
We're just running around

1555
01:41:08,920 --> 01:41:10,920
Alright, that's epic

1556
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:13,920
Let's see this

1557
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:16,920
Dear Maria

1558
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:18,920
I've made, don't come over

1559
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:20,920
I've made an absolutely dog shit cake

1560
01:41:20,920 --> 01:41:22,920
Absolute dog water

1561
01:41:22,920 --> 01:41:24,920
It's awful

1562
01:41:24,920 --> 01:41:26,920
I think your cake is beautiful

1563
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:28,920
What is this?

1564
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:30,920
Look in the middle

1565
01:41:30,920 --> 01:41:32,920
What is this?

1566
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:34,920
Look in the middle

1567
01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:41,920
Oh my god

1568
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:43,920
Whose Satan's cake is this in the middle?

1569
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:45,920
I can't believe it

1570
01:41:46,920 --> 01:41:48,920
You guys like it, like cake?

1571
01:41:48,920 --> 01:41:50,920
That's yours?

1572
01:41:50,920 --> 01:41:52,920
I like it, I love it

1573
01:41:52,920 --> 01:41:54,920
Yeah

1574
01:41:54,920 --> 01:41:57,920
Ty, I'm gonna give two of them with diabetes

1575
01:41:57,920 --> 01:41:59,920
I don't know

1576
01:42:00,920 --> 01:42:02,920
Why is it so floating?

1577
01:42:02,920 --> 01:42:04,920
You know

1578
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:07,920
They were really creative

1579
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:09,920
What's your favorite idea?

1580
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:11,920
Diabetes

1581
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:16,920
I really hope mine wins

1582
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:21,920
I didn't win

1583
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:23,920
Wait, what? I voted

1584
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:25,920
I voted for those two

1585
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:27,920
Yeah, I voted for them

1586
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:29,920
It's okay, it happens

1587
01:42:30,920 --> 01:42:32,920
I'm voting for this

1588
01:42:34,920 --> 01:42:37,920
I'm voting for the most unhinged ones now

1589
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:39,920
That's just really scary

1590
01:42:40,920 --> 01:42:44,920
I feel like I'm even timidated to eat that cake

1591
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:49,920
I like the purple box with a massive candle

1592
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:52,920
Oh, I voted for the purple box

1593
01:42:52,920 --> 01:42:54,920
Purple box?

1594
01:42:54,920 --> 01:42:56,920
I voted for purple box, wait, no

1595
01:42:56,920 --> 01:42:58,920
No, yes I did

1596
01:42:58,920 --> 01:43:00,920
I really liked it

1597
01:43:00,920 --> 01:43:02,920
Oh my god, okay

1598
01:43:02,920 --> 01:43:04,920
Here's a close-up of my cake

1599
01:43:04,920 --> 01:43:06,920
And there's a close-up of my cake

1600
01:43:06,920 --> 01:43:08,920
Oh, that's yours, Tola

1601
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:10,920
You actually yelled me out

1602
01:43:10,920 --> 01:43:12,920
That was pretty tasty

1603
01:43:12,920 --> 01:43:14,920
That was actually really cute

1604
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:16,920
Mine was pretty basic

1605
01:43:16,920 --> 01:43:18,920
Chocolate heart cake

1606
01:43:18,920 --> 01:43:20,920
I didn't win

1607
01:43:20,920 --> 01:43:22,920
I feel like a five-year-old close

1608
01:43:22,920 --> 01:43:24,920
That they decorated it

1609
01:43:24,920 --> 01:43:26,920
I'm tired

1610
01:43:26,920 --> 01:43:28,920
It's okay, it's cute

1611
01:43:30,920 --> 01:43:32,920
Elders for a cake

1612
01:43:32,920 --> 01:43:34,920
Yay, there you go

1613
01:43:34,920 --> 01:43:36,920
I won't get you a cake

1614
01:43:36,920 --> 01:43:38,920
There's my cake on the side

1615
01:43:38,920 --> 01:43:40,920
I came in third

1616
01:43:40,920 --> 01:43:42,920
I came in second

1617
01:43:42,920 --> 01:43:44,920
I came in fifth

1618
01:43:44,920 --> 01:43:46,920
I came in fifth

1619
01:43:46,920 --> 01:43:48,920
I came in second

1620
01:43:48,920 --> 01:43:50,920
Okay, this one's actually kind of fun

1621
01:43:50,920 --> 01:43:52,920
This was fun

1622
01:43:52,920 --> 01:43:54,920
And it's not as stressful as

1623
01:43:54,920 --> 01:43:56,920
dressed to impress

1624
01:43:56,920 --> 01:43:59,920
I have Fia, Boomi, and Rena on my desk

1625
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:01,920
at all at the same time

1626
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:04,920
I was asked a week ago to make a list of games

1627
01:44:04,920 --> 01:44:06,920
and then we played one of the games

1628
01:44:06,920 --> 01:44:08,920
and then they all opted out from the horror

1629
01:44:08,920 --> 01:44:10,920
Well, we didn't know how scary Roblox

1630
01:44:10,920 --> 01:44:12,920
was actually going to be

1631
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:14,920
I was like, oh, horror?

1632
01:44:14,920 --> 01:44:16,920
I thought it was going to be funny

1633
01:44:16,920 --> 01:44:18,920
No, I was picking genuine

1634
01:44:18,920 --> 01:44:20,920
I was going to...

1635
01:44:20,920 --> 01:44:22,920
The next one was worse

1636
01:44:22,920 --> 01:44:24,920
I was going to pick another one

1637
01:44:24,920 --> 01:44:26,920
There's so many micro-transactions in this game

1638
01:44:26,920 --> 01:44:28,920
Yeah, I don't know what's happening

1639
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:30,920
Hey, look at my cake

1640
01:44:30,920 --> 01:44:32,920
It looks so cute

1641
01:44:32,920 --> 01:44:34,920
Hi, Chibi

1642
01:44:34,920 --> 01:44:36,920
Chibi

1643
01:44:36,920 --> 01:44:38,920
Wait, I'm tired

1644
01:44:38,920 --> 01:44:40,920
I'm washing

1645
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:42,920
I'm getting a crate

1646
01:44:42,920 --> 01:44:44,920
I got a new treat

1647
01:44:44,920 --> 01:44:46,920
Oh, look, I'm in my cake

1648
01:44:46,920 --> 01:44:48,920
You can eat me

1649
01:44:48,920 --> 01:44:50,920
I would like to eat you

1650
01:44:50,920 --> 01:44:52,920
Where'd you eat my cake?

1651
01:44:52,920 --> 01:44:54,920
Wow

1652
01:44:54,920 --> 01:44:56,920
Chibi actually just dumped everything

1653
01:44:56,920 --> 01:44:58,920
that she clicked on here as well

1654
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:02,920
I can't get out

1655
01:45:02,920 --> 01:45:04,920
I'm stuck

1656
01:45:04,920 --> 01:45:06,920
Wait, I want a picture of my cake

1657
01:45:06,920 --> 01:45:08,920
Guys, it's fucking gojo

1658
01:45:08,920 --> 01:45:10,920
Gojo's in the game

1659
01:45:12,920 --> 01:45:14,920
Hey, little gals, we are not all gay

1660
01:45:14,920 --> 01:45:16,920
It's okay, I'll make it even better

1661
01:45:18,920 --> 01:45:20,920
Summer sky

1662
01:45:20,920 --> 01:45:22,920
Although, purple pearls

1663
01:45:22,920 --> 01:45:24,920
Now I have vanilla sprinkles

1664
01:45:24,920 --> 01:45:26,920
I picked vanilla sprinkles

1665
01:45:26,920 --> 01:45:28,920
The theme is vanilla sprinkles

1666
01:45:28,920 --> 01:45:30,920
Boomi, what are you doing here?

1667
01:45:30,920 --> 01:45:32,920
Wait, I'm tired

1668
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:36,920
Chibi is a scientist

1669
01:45:36,920 --> 01:45:38,920
Okay, this time I win

1670
01:45:40,920 --> 01:45:42,920
Oh, that's VIP

1671
01:45:50,920 --> 01:45:52,920
This is so cute

1672
01:45:54,920 --> 01:45:56,920
Boomi is sitting on my hand

1673
01:46:00,920 --> 01:46:02,920
Now I know how to play, for real

1674
01:46:02,920 --> 01:46:04,920
Yes

1675
01:46:04,920 --> 01:46:06,920
Everything else is locked

1676
01:46:20,920 --> 01:46:22,920
Wait

1677
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:26,920
Ooh, that actually looks pretty good

1678
01:46:26,920 --> 01:46:28,920
I

1679
01:46:32,920 --> 01:46:34,920
I haven't heard that song

1680
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:36,920
in forever

1681
01:46:36,920 --> 01:46:38,920
Okay

1682
01:46:50,920 --> 01:46:52,920
But how do you know that song?

1683
01:46:56,920 --> 01:46:58,920
I don't know

1684
01:47:00,920 --> 01:47:02,920
Yeah, that's fluffal puff

1685
01:47:02,920 --> 01:47:04,920
I don't know what that is

1686
01:47:04,920 --> 01:47:06,920
You literally just described her

1687
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:08,920
I don't know what you mean

1688
01:47:08,920 --> 01:47:10,920
You don't know what that is

1689
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:12,920
I'm kind of maybe stupid

1690
01:47:12,920 --> 01:47:14,920
I apologize

1691
01:47:14,920 --> 01:47:16,920
Kind of maybe

1692
01:47:18,920 --> 01:47:20,920
I know, that was out of line

1693
01:47:20,920 --> 01:47:22,920
My bad

1694
01:47:22,920 --> 01:47:24,920
But

1695
01:47:24,920 --> 01:47:26,920
It'd be like that sometimes

1696
01:47:26,920 --> 01:47:28,920
I know, because I'm also kind of stupid

1697
01:47:30,920 --> 01:47:32,920
Sometimes the stupidest girls are

1698
01:47:32,920 --> 01:47:34,920
The sweetest ladies

1699
01:47:34,920 --> 01:47:36,920
The dumber she is

1700
01:47:36,920 --> 01:47:38,920
The sweeter she is

1701
01:47:38,920 --> 01:47:40,920
I think I don't know

1702
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:42,920
Maybe, I don't know about that one

1703
01:47:42,920 --> 01:47:44,920
But, you know, we'll believe it

1704
01:47:48,920 --> 01:47:50,920
Oh my god, I can literally

1705
01:47:50,920 --> 01:47:52,920
Make things like fly away

1706
01:47:52,920 --> 01:47:54,920
What the hell

1707
01:47:56,920 --> 01:47:58,920
That's how I discovered it

1708
01:47:58,920 --> 01:48:00,920
Yeah, what the heck

1709
01:48:00,920 --> 01:48:02,920
Dad, do you like my cake?

1710
01:48:06,920 --> 01:48:08,920
Do you like this cake?

1711
01:48:10,920 --> 01:48:12,920
Are these biscotties?

1712
01:48:12,920 --> 01:48:14,920
The fuck?

1713
01:48:14,920 --> 01:48:16,920
They are, they're biscotties

1714
01:48:20,920 --> 01:48:22,920
Oh, this is

1715
01:48:22,920 --> 01:48:24,920
This feels great

1716
01:48:24,920 --> 01:48:26,920
I love this

1717
01:48:26,920 --> 01:48:28,920
Oh, I got cookies

1718
01:48:28,920 --> 01:48:30,920
I can change the color of them

1719
01:48:32,920 --> 01:48:34,920
Okay

1720
01:48:34,920 --> 01:48:36,920
Wait, bows

1721
01:48:42,920 --> 01:48:44,920
Oh

1722
01:48:44,920 --> 01:48:46,920
Blackish

1723
01:48:46,920 --> 01:48:48,920
White

1724
01:48:48,920 --> 01:48:50,920
Sprinkles

1725
01:48:54,920 --> 01:48:56,920
Now

1726
01:48:56,920 --> 01:48:58,920
I got new tier 2 of my cake

1727
01:49:00,920 --> 01:49:02,920
Element as well

1728
01:49:06,920 --> 01:49:08,920
I don't like actual sprinkles

1729
01:49:08,920 --> 01:49:10,920
I think, which kind of sucks

1730
01:49:14,920 --> 01:49:16,920
Yeah

1731
01:49:18,920 --> 01:49:20,920
I want it to be yellow

1732
01:49:20,920 --> 01:49:22,920
Yeah

1733
01:49:22,920 --> 01:49:24,920
A piss cake, I see

1734
01:49:24,920 --> 01:49:26,920
Yeah

1735
01:49:30,920 --> 01:49:32,920
Wait, wait, this is a trivial

1736
01:49:32,920 --> 01:49:34,920
My user name Otaku Vanilla

1737
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:36,920
This is like for me

1738
01:49:36,920 --> 01:49:38,920
For real

1739
01:49:38,920 --> 01:49:40,920
It's just like me for real

1740
01:49:40,920 --> 01:49:42,920
For real

1741
01:49:42,920 --> 01:49:44,920
Oh, this is so cute

1742
01:49:44,920 --> 01:49:46,920
There are sprinkles

1743
01:49:46,920 --> 01:49:48,920
You will

1744
01:49:48,920 --> 01:49:50,920
That's reassuring

1745
01:49:50,920 --> 01:49:52,920
I think?

1746
01:49:52,920 --> 01:49:54,920
Honestly, I'm not quite sure

1747
01:49:54,920 --> 01:49:56,920
It says sprinkles

1748
01:49:56,920 --> 01:49:58,920
Reyna, what are you doing?

1749
01:49:58,920 --> 01:50:00,920
She's like digging in my chair

1750
01:50:00,920 --> 01:50:02,920
Scran, what's a scran?

1751
01:50:04,920 --> 01:50:06,920
What's a scran?

1752
01:50:06,920 --> 01:50:08,920
I learned to screw them once

1753
01:50:08,920 --> 01:50:10,920
What?

1754
01:50:10,920 --> 01:50:12,920
Right now?

1755
01:50:12,920 --> 01:50:14,920
No, like a while ago

1756
01:50:14,920 --> 01:50:16,920
Talking about

1757
01:50:16,920 --> 01:50:18,920
Screwed them

1758
01:50:18,920 --> 01:50:20,920
I think we made a screwed them

1759
01:50:20,920 --> 01:50:22,920
Pack together, I don't know

1760
01:50:22,920 --> 01:50:24,920
What is a screwed them pack?

1761
01:50:24,920 --> 01:50:26,920
I don't know, I didn't want to ask anymore

1762
01:50:26,920 --> 01:50:28,920
What does that mean?

1763
01:50:28,920 --> 01:50:30,920
I don't know, that's what they did

1764
01:50:30,920 --> 01:50:32,920
They made a screwed them pack in my server

1765
01:50:34,920 --> 01:50:36,920
Oh, screwed them

1766
01:50:36,920 --> 01:50:38,920
Oh, that's okay

1767
01:50:38,920 --> 01:50:40,920
They made like a pack

1768
01:50:40,920 --> 01:50:42,920
You can't judge them

1769
01:50:42,920 --> 01:50:44,920
You can't absolutely judge them

1770
01:50:44,920 --> 01:50:46,920
You guys don't like my cake?

1771
01:50:46,920 --> 01:50:48,920
My audience doesn't like my cake

1772
01:50:48,920 --> 01:50:50,920
Kill them

1773
01:50:50,920 --> 01:50:52,920
I might

1774
01:50:52,920 --> 01:50:54,920
You can say for food, which in the context

1775
01:50:54,920 --> 01:50:56,920
Would you eat the food or not?

1776
01:50:56,920 --> 01:50:58,920
It's a scran

1777
01:50:58,920 --> 01:51:00,920
Oh, so you won't eat my cake

1778
01:51:00,920 --> 01:51:02,920
Because you hate me, you want me to die

1779
01:51:02,920 --> 01:51:04,920
Got it, I understand

1780
01:51:04,920 --> 01:51:06,920
I feel like, no

1781
01:51:06,920 --> 01:51:08,920
Queen, you're so sexy

1782
01:51:08,920 --> 01:51:10,920
Don't die

1783
01:51:10,920 --> 01:51:12,920
You're right, they should die

1784
01:51:14,920 --> 01:51:16,920
Queen, don't listen to them

1785
01:51:16,920 --> 01:51:18,920
They don't know

1786
01:51:18,920 --> 01:51:20,920
They don't know

1787
01:51:20,920 --> 01:51:22,920
Where does Sprinkle's at?

1788
01:51:22,920 --> 01:51:24,920
Yeah, where are they?

1789
01:51:24,920 --> 01:51:26,920
I think it was because I clicked something that was cannoli related

1790
01:51:28,920 --> 01:51:30,920
Wait, someone said they must be pretty tight

1791
01:51:30,920 --> 01:51:32,920
For a screwed them pack

1792
01:51:32,920 --> 01:51:34,920
A screwed them pack is like a thing for real

1793
01:51:34,920 --> 01:51:36,920
Well, I think

1794
01:51:36,920 --> 01:51:38,920
It's not a sand castle, it's vanilla

1795
01:51:38,920 --> 01:51:40,920
Maybe a screwed them pack is like

1796
01:51:40,920 --> 01:51:42,920
Just a promising to dock each other

1797
01:51:42,920 --> 01:51:44,920
Or

1798
01:51:44,920 --> 01:51:46,920
Like froth or something like that

1799
01:51:46,920 --> 01:51:48,920
Okay, I'm gonna ask a question

1800
01:51:48,920 --> 01:51:50,920
What is froth and docking?

1801
01:51:50,920 --> 01:51:52,920
Well docking is when you

1802
01:51:52,920 --> 01:51:54,920
Make the penis heads kiss

1803
01:51:54,920 --> 01:51:56,920
And frothing is when you rub the penises together

1804
01:51:56,920 --> 01:51:58,920
What are we talking about?

1805
01:52:00,920 --> 01:52:02,920
I'm just sad, I wish that

1806
01:52:02,920 --> 01:52:04,920
Mari never asked

1807
01:52:04,920 --> 01:52:06,920
I'm sorry

1808
01:52:06,920 --> 01:52:08,920
I wish I never asked

1809
01:52:08,920 --> 01:52:10,920
Well, you asked

1810
01:52:10,920 --> 01:52:12,920
Yeah, I'm thinking about

1811
01:52:12,920 --> 01:52:14,920
You literally asked

1812
01:52:14,920 --> 01:52:16,920
I know, and now I'm thinking about

1813
01:52:16,920 --> 01:52:18,920
Them and thinking about it too

1814
01:52:18,920 --> 01:52:20,920
Guys, if I can't find the sprinkles, what's the point?

1815
01:52:20,920 --> 01:52:22,920
Yeah, I don't get it

1816
01:52:22,920 --> 01:52:24,920
Are we supposed to make our own?

1817
01:52:24,920 --> 01:52:26,920
I kind of made my own

1818
01:52:26,920 --> 01:52:28,920
I made

1819
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:30,920
I improvised

1820
01:52:30,920 --> 01:52:32,920
Yeah, I don't know what a vanilla sprinkle cake looks like

1821
01:52:32,920 --> 01:52:34,920
I wonder if I'll run into Gojo in here

1822
01:52:34,920 --> 01:52:36,920
Well, you guys are

1823
01:52:36,920 --> 01:52:38,920
Oh, you can sit in the chairs

1824
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:40,920
Yeah

1825
01:52:40,920 --> 01:52:42,920
Let me know if you see Gojo

1826
01:52:42,920 --> 01:52:44,920
Oh my god, I have 57 seconds

1827
01:52:44,920 --> 01:52:46,920
What?

1828
01:52:46,920 --> 01:52:48,920
Oh, 54

1829
01:52:48,920 --> 01:52:50,920
52

1830
01:52:50,920 --> 01:52:52,920
51

1831
01:52:52,920 --> 01:52:54,920
50

1832
01:52:54,920 --> 01:52:56,920
49

1833
01:52:56,920 --> 01:52:58,920
48

1834
01:52:58,920 --> 01:53:00,920
I'm sorry

1835
01:53:00,920 --> 01:53:02,920
I kind of literally made some

1836
01:53:02,920 --> 01:53:04,920
A little bird stuff in my chest

1837
01:53:04,920 --> 01:53:06,920
I thought

1838
01:53:06,920 --> 01:53:08,920
It actually looks good

1839
01:53:08,920 --> 01:53:10,920
It actually looks good today

1840
01:53:10,920 --> 01:53:12,920
This time I tried

1841
01:53:12,920 --> 01:53:14,920
Me too

1842
01:53:14,920 --> 01:53:16,920
That's all we can ask

1843
01:53:16,920 --> 01:53:18,920
Yeah, I didn't know what to do either

1844
01:53:18,920 --> 01:53:20,920
I'm sorry

1845
01:53:20,920 --> 01:53:22,920
It's kind of confusing

1846
01:53:22,920 --> 01:53:24,920
It's a vanilla cake

1847
01:53:24,920 --> 01:53:26,920
There's no sprinkle though

1848
01:53:28,920 --> 01:53:30,920
Vanilla

1849
01:53:30,920 --> 01:53:32,920
Oh

1850
01:53:32,920 --> 01:53:34,920
What?

1851
01:53:34,920 --> 01:53:36,920
I like my cake

1852
01:53:36,920 --> 01:53:38,920
I'm very happy

1853
01:53:38,920 --> 01:53:40,920
Okay, you want me to do the countdown?

1854
01:53:40,920 --> 01:53:42,920
Yeah

1855
01:53:42,920 --> 01:53:44,920
10

1856
01:53:44,920 --> 01:53:46,920
9

1857
01:53:46,920 --> 01:53:48,920
8

1858
01:53:48,920 --> 01:53:50,920
7

1859
01:53:50,920 --> 01:53:52,920
6

1860
01:53:52,920 --> 01:53:54,920
5

1861
01:53:54,920 --> 01:53:56,920
2

1862
01:53:56,920 --> 01:53:58,920
1

1863
01:53:58,920 --> 01:54:00,920
1

1864
01:54:00,920 --> 01:54:02,920
2

1865
01:54:02,920 --> 01:54:04,920
3

1866
01:54:04,920 --> 01:54:06,920
4

1867
01:54:06,920 --> 01:54:08,920
5

1868
01:54:08,920 --> 01:54:10,920
6

1869
01:54:10,920 --> 01:54:12,920
7

1870
01:54:12,920 --> 01:54:14,920
8

1871
01:54:14,920 --> 01:54:16,920
9

1872
01:54:16,920 --> 01:54:18,920
10

1873
01:54:18,920 --> 01:54:20,920
11

1874
01:54:20,920 --> 01:54:22,920
12

1875
01:54:22,920 --> 01:54:24,920
13

1876
01:54:24,920 --> 01:54:26,920
14

1877
01:54:26,920 --> 01:54:30,920
Wait, all these cakes are so beauty

1878
01:54:30,920 --> 01:54:32,920
I love them

1879
01:54:34,920 --> 01:54:36,920
These are cute

1880
01:54:36,920 --> 01:54:38,920
I like this one

1881
01:54:42,920 --> 01:54:44,920
I like this one

1882
01:54:44,920 --> 01:54:46,920
I like how chill this is

1883
01:54:46,920 --> 01:54:48,920
You don't have to run around

1884
01:54:48,920 --> 01:54:50,920
You just have to click through menus

1885
01:54:50,920 --> 01:54:52,920
I don't think I'm going to make it, bros

1886
01:54:52,920 --> 01:54:54,920
I don't think I'm going to

1887
01:54:54,920 --> 01:54:56,920
I'm really sad

1888
01:54:56,920 --> 01:54:58,920
I worked really hard on that

1889
01:54:58,920 --> 01:55:00,920
It looked really good

1890
01:55:00,920 --> 01:55:02,920
Whenever your cake was, I bet it was beautiful

1891
01:55:02,920 --> 01:55:04,920
Mine was the one to the right

1892
01:55:04,920 --> 01:55:06,920
I voted for it

1893
01:55:06,920 --> 01:55:08,920
I'm really bummed

1894
01:55:08,920 --> 01:55:10,920
I think I voted for it

1895
01:55:10,920 --> 01:55:12,920
Don't cry

1896
01:55:12,920 --> 01:55:14,920
You know what?

1897
01:55:14,920 --> 01:55:16,920
The blue one kind of reminds me of Icy a bit

1898
01:55:18,920 --> 01:55:20,920
Icy snow paws

1899
01:55:20,920 --> 01:55:22,920
Yeah, it's like an Icy

1900
01:55:22,920 --> 01:55:24,920
Icy snow jobs

1901
01:55:24,920 --> 01:55:26,920
Icy snow paws

1902
01:55:26,920 --> 01:55:28,920
We could make our own themes if we wanted

1903
01:55:28,920 --> 01:55:30,920
We could be like

1904
01:55:30,920 --> 01:55:32,920
Let's all do a Touma cake

1905
01:55:32,920 --> 01:55:34,920
Let's all do a Shibi cake

1906
01:55:34,920 --> 01:55:36,920
Let's all do a Mari cake

1907
01:55:36,920 --> 01:55:38,920
And then try to theme it with the colors

1908
01:55:38,920 --> 01:55:40,920
Color schemes and everything

1909
01:55:40,920 --> 01:55:42,920
Shibi cake

1910
01:55:42,920 --> 01:55:44,920
You know what? I'm not even mad

1911
01:55:44,920 --> 01:55:46,920
I love your Shibi

1912
01:55:46,920 --> 01:55:48,920
Mine was the tall three tier one

1913
01:55:48,920 --> 01:55:50,920
I liked yours

1914
01:55:50,920 --> 01:55:52,920
I like

1915
01:55:52,920 --> 01:55:54,920
I like the one with color on it

1916
01:55:54,920 --> 01:55:56,920
It just really ups

1917
01:55:56,920 --> 01:55:58,920
That one has sprinkles

1918
01:55:58,920 --> 01:56:00,920
Yeah, how do they do that?

1919
01:56:00,920 --> 01:56:02,920
How do they do that?

1920
01:56:02,920 --> 01:56:04,920
I'm going to type in chat

1921
01:56:04,920 --> 01:56:06,920
How did you do that?

1922
01:56:08,920 --> 01:56:10,920
Oh my god, it's a black lady

1923
01:56:10,920 --> 01:56:12,920
Mari

1924
01:56:12,920 --> 01:56:14,920
I came in second

1925
01:56:14,920 --> 01:56:16,920
I came in second

1926
01:56:16,920 --> 01:56:18,920
You were the blue one

1927
01:56:18,920 --> 01:56:20,920
We're even sitting on my cake

1928
01:56:20,920 --> 01:56:22,920
What the fuck?

1929
01:56:22,920 --> 01:56:24,920
You want me to hit them?

1930
01:56:24,920 --> 01:56:26,920
Yeah, we're going to hit you with a stick

1931
01:56:26,920 --> 01:56:28,920
Not a stick

1932
01:56:28,920 --> 01:56:30,920
I'm going to grab a pipe bomb and I'm going to put up your butts

1933
01:56:30,920 --> 01:56:32,920
Each and every single one of you individually

1934
01:56:32,920 --> 01:56:34,920
You can't say that

1935
01:56:34,920 --> 01:56:36,920
For fun, in game, in Minecraft

1936
01:56:36,920 --> 01:56:38,920
Oh wait

1937
01:56:38,920 --> 01:56:40,920
That was Gojo's cake

1938
01:56:40,920 --> 01:56:42,920
Gojo's really tried

1939
01:56:42,920 --> 01:56:44,920
I think

1940
01:56:44,920 --> 01:56:46,920
Mari?

1941
01:56:46,920 --> 01:56:48,920
Your model is freaking out

1942
01:56:48,920 --> 01:56:50,920
Why does my model always do that?

1943
01:56:50,920 --> 01:56:52,920
Oh god, it's Gojo

1944
01:56:52,920 --> 01:56:54,920
Look how big he is

1945
01:56:54,920 --> 01:56:56,920
I'm kind of scared

1946
01:56:56,920 --> 01:56:58,920
He's so tall

1947
01:56:58,920 --> 01:57:00,920
I'm going to run away

1948
01:57:00,920 --> 01:57:02,920
He's saying

1949
01:57:02,920 --> 01:57:04,920
Nah, I win

1950
01:57:04,920 --> 01:57:06,920
We have matching things

1951
01:57:06,920 --> 01:57:08,920
Nah, I'm Sigma

1952
01:57:08,920 --> 01:57:10,920
Wait, I can just do this to you

1953
01:57:10,920 --> 01:57:12,920
I can't line up to the

1954
01:57:12,920 --> 01:57:14,920
Microphone

1955
01:57:14,920 --> 01:57:16,920
Where are you?

1956
01:57:16,920 --> 01:57:18,920
There we go

1957
01:57:18,920 --> 01:57:20,920
I keep doing the gritty

1958
01:57:20,920 --> 01:57:22,920
For some reason

1959
01:57:22,920 --> 01:57:24,920
Yay

1960
01:57:24,920 --> 01:57:26,920
Big fan

1961
01:57:26,920 --> 01:57:28,920
Big fan

1962
01:57:28,920 --> 01:57:30,920
Big fan

1963
01:57:30,920 --> 01:57:32,920
Big fan, it's Kalyu Cheese

1964
01:57:32,920 --> 01:57:34,920
It's Kalyu Cheese

1965
01:57:34,920 --> 01:57:36,920
Oh my god, have you guys

1966
01:57:36,920 --> 01:57:38,920
Been seeing clips of that game that looks like

1967
01:57:38,920 --> 01:57:40,920
It's kind of like

1968
01:57:40,920 --> 01:57:42,920
Space Station 13 and Among Us

1969
01:57:42,920 --> 01:57:44,920
Oh

1970
01:57:44,920 --> 01:57:46,920
No, I have it

1971
01:57:46,920 --> 01:57:48,920
I don't even know what to vote for

1972
01:57:48,920 --> 01:57:50,920
I'll do Fruit Salad with Toma

1973
01:57:50,920 --> 01:57:52,920
Wait, okay

1974
01:57:52,920 --> 01:57:54,920
Or you can do Cocoa Kiss

1975
01:57:54,920 --> 01:57:56,920
That's fine, I'll go

1976
01:57:56,920 --> 01:57:58,920
Nah, we'll do Fruit Salad

1977
01:57:58,920 --> 01:58:00,920
Yummy, I'm getting lost

1978
01:58:00,920 --> 01:58:02,920
I literally did Fruit Salad and I did Cocoa Kiss

1979
01:58:02,920 --> 01:58:04,920
I wanted Cocoa Kiss

1980
01:58:04,920 --> 01:58:06,920
I changed it

1981
01:58:06,920 --> 01:58:08,920
Wait, I don't know what Cocoa is

1982
01:58:08,920 --> 01:58:10,920
You know what Cocoa is

1983
01:58:10,920 --> 01:58:12,920
Yes, I know

1984
01:58:12,920 --> 01:58:14,920
It's a nut

1985
01:58:14,920 --> 01:58:16,920
I'll do this one

1986
01:58:16,920 --> 01:58:18,920
A Cocoa Nut

1987
01:58:18,920 --> 01:58:20,920
Yeah, I have Cocoa Nuts

1988
01:58:20,920 --> 01:58:22,920
They're small though

1989
01:58:22,920 --> 01:58:24,920
My Cocoa Nuts are big

1990
01:58:24,920 --> 01:58:26,920
I have the audacity

1991
01:58:26,920 --> 01:58:28,920
I have a new plate

1992
01:58:30,920 --> 01:58:32,920
Can I

1993
01:58:32,920 --> 01:58:34,920
Can we share some Cocoa Nuts?

1994
01:58:34,920 --> 01:58:36,920
Yeah, we can share some Cocoa Nuts

1995
01:58:36,920 --> 01:58:38,920
I have nothing

1996
01:58:38,920 --> 01:58:40,920
Oh

1997
01:58:40,920 --> 01:58:42,920
Why is this in there?

1998
01:58:42,920 --> 01:58:44,920
I decorate my cake from the bottom up, okay guys

1999
01:58:44,920 --> 01:58:46,920
Okay

2000
01:58:46,920 --> 01:58:48,920
I like the top

2001
01:58:48,920 --> 01:58:50,920
Cocoa

2002
01:58:50,920 --> 01:58:52,920
You know what?

2003
01:58:52,920 --> 01:58:54,920
Can I say something controversial?

2004
01:58:54,920 --> 01:58:56,920
Yes

2005
01:58:56,920 --> 01:58:58,920
Raspberries are a trash fruit

2006
01:58:58,920 --> 01:59:00,920
They're so pretty but they taste so bad

2007
01:59:00,920 --> 01:59:02,920
when you get them fresh

2008
01:59:02,920 --> 01:59:04,920
I love raspberries

2009
01:59:04,920 --> 01:59:06,920
Raspberries? No way, you just said that

2010
01:59:06,920 --> 01:59:08,920
Raspberries hurt

2011
01:59:08,920 --> 01:59:10,920
Yep

2012
01:59:10,920 --> 01:59:12,920
I know

2013
01:59:12,920 --> 01:59:14,920
That's why I said

2014
01:59:14,920 --> 01:59:16,920
Can I say something controversial?

2015
01:59:16,920 --> 01:59:18,920
Extremely controversial

2016
01:59:18,920 --> 01:59:20,920
Can I say something?

2017
01:59:20,920 --> 01:59:22,920
I've never

2018
01:59:22,920 --> 01:59:24,920
I've never had a raspberry

2019
01:59:24,920 --> 01:59:26,920
That's weird

2020
01:59:32,920 --> 01:59:34,920
Listen, a lot of things freak me out

2021
01:59:34,920 --> 01:59:36,920
Is it because of the color?

2022
01:59:36,920 --> 01:59:38,920
Yeah

2023
01:59:38,920 --> 01:59:40,920
The recess? Probably

2024
01:59:40,920 --> 01:59:42,920
Wait, the color of raspberries

2025
01:59:42,920 --> 01:59:44,920
is red, so what does that even mean?

2026
01:59:48,920 --> 01:59:50,920
Um

2027
01:59:50,920 --> 01:59:52,920
Um

2028
01:59:52,920 --> 01:59:54,920
Um

2029
01:59:54,920 --> 01:59:56,920
Um

2030
01:59:56,920 --> 01:59:58,920
I like you Chai

2031
01:59:58,920 --> 02:00:00,920
Okay

2032
02:00:00,920 --> 02:00:02,920
I like Chai though

2033
02:00:02,920 --> 02:00:04,920
Chai is my favorite red thing

2034
02:00:04,920 --> 02:00:06,920
My favorite red thing

2035
02:00:06,920 --> 02:00:08,920
My favorite red thing

2036
02:00:08,920 --> 02:00:10,920
Hey, Chibi, aren't you

2037
02:00:10,920 --> 02:00:12,920
You're my favorite mommy

2038
02:00:12,920 --> 02:00:14,920
There's a difference, okay?

2039
02:00:14,920 --> 02:00:16,920
Chai is like

2040
02:00:16,920 --> 02:00:18,920
We're in the same little itch brand category

2041
02:00:18,920 --> 02:00:20,920
You know, we're just a little bunch of babies

2042
02:00:20,920 --> 02:00:22,920
You're my favorite mommy red thing

2043
02:00:22,920 --> 02:00:24,920
See?

2044
02:00:24,920 --> 02:00:26,920
Wow, I see

2045
02:00:26,920 --> 02:00:28,920
What? You're my favorite

2046
02:00:28,920 --> 02:00:30,920
I give you my money, I don't want getting anybody my money

2047
02:00:30,920 --> 02:00:32,920
And you're being rude about it

2048
02:00:32,920 --> 02:00:34,920
You gave me your money? What do you mean you gave me your money?

2049
02:00:34,920 --> 02:00:36,920
I subbed to you

2050
02:00:36,920 --> 02:00:38,920
Oh yeah, that's true

2051
02:00:38,920 --> 02:00:40,920
Not once, but twice

2052
02:00:40,920 --> 02:00:42,920
Not once, but twice

2053
02:00:42,920 --> 02:00:44,920
And in your whole life I subbed to you

2054
02:00:44,920 --> 02:00:46,920
I don't know guys

2055
02:00:46,920 --> 02:00:48,920
I feel like that's emotional manipulation

2056
02:00:48,920 --> 02:00:50,920
Nuh-uh, nuh-uh, nuh-uh

2057
02:00:50,920 --> 02:00:52,920
It's my penis to be erect, so it's fine

2058
02:00:52,920 --> 02:00:54,920
What?

2059
02:00:54,920 --> 02:00:56,920
Who said that?

2060
02:00:56,920 --> 02:00:58,920
You did

2061
02:00:58,920 --> 02:01:00,920
It's weird, do you guys ever think about that?

2062
02:01:00,920 --> 02:01:02,920
What?

2063
02:01:02,920 --> 02:01:04,920
I'm not weird, I'm not weird

2064
02:01:04,920 --> 02:01:06,920
I'm not weird, right?

2065
02:01:06,920 --> 02:01:08,920
I'm not weird, guys

2066
02:01:08,920 --> 02:01:10,920
I would try to become a savage

2067
02:01:10,920 --> 02:01:12,920
I'm not weird

2068
02:01:12,920 --> 02:01:14,920
I'm not weird

2069
02:01:14,920 --> 02:01:16,920
I don't know guys

2070
02:01:16,920 --> 02:01:18,920
I'm feeling real unsafe right now

2071
02:01:18,920 --> 02:01:20,920
What do you mean?

2072
02:01:20,920 --> 02:01:22,920
Like, we're supposed to be playing

2073
02:01:22,920 --> 02:01:24,920
a really fun, you know

2074
02:01:24,920 --> 02:01:26,920
case-mic rating game

2075
02:01:26,920 --> 02:01:28,920
I'm not, I'm not weird

2076
02:01:28,920 --> 02:01:30,920
This all started because of your

2077
02:01:30,920 --> 02:01:32,920
controversial opinion

2078
02:01:32,920 --> 02:01:34,920
All I said was I don't think

2079
02:01:34,920 --> 02:01:36,920
raspberries are good

2080
02:01:36,920 --> 02:01:38,920
I just got it, and I just got called weird

2081
02:01:38,920 --> 02:01:40,920
I know

2082
02:01:40,920 --> 02:01:42,920
And I just got called weird

2083
02:01:42,920 --> 02:01:44,920
I'm not weird, I'm just

2084
02:01:44,920 --> 02:01:46,920
It's uh, it's uh

2085
02:01:46,920 --> 02:01:48,920
It's just

2086
02:01:48,920 --> 02:01:50,920
my superpower, okay?

2087
02:01:50,920 --> 02:01:52,920
Chat, pick the color

2088
02:01:52,920 --> 02:01:54,920
Guys, I don't know what the fuck this cake

2089
02:01:54,920 --> 02:01:56,920
Wait, my cake doesn't have a

2090
02:01:56,920 --> 02:01:58,920
top, it's just one

2091
02:01:58,920 --> 02:02:00,920
thing

2092
02:02:00,920 --> 02:02:02,920
Your cake is naked

2093
02:02:02,920 --> 02:02:04,920
What cake?

2094
02:02:06,920 --> 02:02:08,920
You guys ever seen Max and Ruby?

2095
02:02:08,920 --> 02:02:10,920
I'm a little red

2096
02:02:10,920 --> 02:02:12,920
Yes, I love Max and Ruby

2097
02:02:12,920 --> 02:02:14,920
I always think that Ruby is a little

2098
02:02:14,920 --> 02:02:16,920
out of line though

2099
02:02:16,920 --> 02:02:18,920
Cause she's kind of

2100
02:02:18,920 --> 02:02:20,920
fucking bossy, and like

2101
02:02:20,920 --> 02:02:22,920
I don't think Max deserves that

2102
02:02:22,920 --> 02:02:24,920
I know, Max can't really think about it

2103
02:02:24,920 --> 02:02:26,920
cause he can't talk

2104
02:02:26,920 --> 02:02:28,920
A thing that like, he couldn't talk cause he like

2105
02:02:28,920 --> 02:02:30,920
Is he just not verbal?

2106
02:02:30,920 --> 02:02:32,920
Is that the thing? Yeah, cause his like

2107
02:02:32,920 --> 02:02:34,920
parents died or something

2108
02:02:34,920 --> 02:02:36,920
What? Oh wait, was there real lord

2109
02:02:36,920 --> 02:02:38,920
of it?

2110
02:02:38,920 --> 02:02:40,920
I don't know about all that

2111
02:02:40,920 --> 02:02:42,920
GV, but I just know that

2112
02:02:42,920 --> 02:02:44,920
Ruby can suck a

2113
02:02:44,920 --> 02:02:46,920
dick cause she's rude as hell

2114
02:02:46,920 --> 02:02:48,920
Max and Ruby

2115
02:02:48,920 --> 02:02:50,920
Max makes like a

2116
02:02:50,920 --> 02:02:52,920
dirt cake

2117
02:02:52,920 --> 02:02:54,920
Yeah

2118
02:02:54,920 --> 02:02:56,920
Chocolatey dirt cake

2119
02:02:56,920 --> 02:02:58,920
I wish I could

2120
02:02:58,920 --> 02:03:00,920
recreate that right now

2121
02:03:00,920 --> 02:03:02,920
I don't know what I'm

2122
02:03:02,920 --> 02:03:04,920
supposed to be doing

2123
02:03:04,920 --> 02:03:06,920
We're making a cocoa kiss

2124
02:03:10,920 --> 02:03:12,920
You know, just kiss the

2125
02:03:12,920 --> 02:03:14,920
I forgot the kiss part

2126
02:03:14,920 --> 02:03:16,920
Mwah

2127
02:03:16,920 --> 02:03:18,920
Mwah

2128
02:03:18,920 --> 02:03:20,920
Where it is

2129
02:03:20,920 --> 02:03:22,920
Girls kissing on stream

2130
02:03:22,920 --> 02:03:24,920
Mwah

2131
02:03:24,920 --> 02:03:26,920
Mwah

2132
02:03:26,920 --> 02:03:28,920
I like kissing on stream

2133
02:03:28,920 --> 02:03:30,920
I like kissing

2134
02:03:32,920 --> 02:03:34,920
Coco

2135
02:03:34,920 --> 02:03:36,920
Coco, okay

2136
02:03:36,920 --> 02:03:38,920
This is so peaceful, but I feel like

2137
02:03:38,920 --> 02:03:40,920
I don't like it because it's so peaceful

2138
02:03:40,920 --> 02:03:42,920
In my little

2139
02:03:42,920 --> 02:03:44,920
Dude, I have like a little toddler brain

2140
02:03:44,920 --> 02:03:46,920
I actually need to like be stimulated right now

2141
02:03:46,920 --> 02:03:48,920
Like I need someone to hold on to my face

2142
02:03:48,920 --> 02:03:50,920
Hold on

2143
02:03:50,920 --> 02:03:52,920
Oh there you go

2144
02:03:52,920 --> 02:03:54,920
Thank you

2145
02:03:54,920 --> 02:03:56,920
There you go, I got you

2146
02:03:56,920 --> 02:03:58,920
Wait, does that actually sound really fun?

2147
02:03:58,920 --> 02:04:00,920
Like a kiss?

2148
02:04:00,920 --> 02:04:02,920
No

2149
02:04:02,920 --> 02:04:04,920
I want them

2150
02:04:04,920 --> 02:04:06,920
Looks like little poops

2151
02:04:08,920 --> 02:04:10,920
I want

2152
02:04:10,920 --> 02:04:12,920
The keys, ma'am

2153
02:04:12,920 --> 02:04:14,920
We might need to put on

2154
02:04:14,920 --> 02:04:16,920
We might need to put on fruit sensory videos

2155
02:04:16,920 --> 02:04:18,920
For her, she's gonna go far with we go

2156
02:04:18,920 --> 02:04:20,920
I will fall asleep if we do that

2157
02:04:20,920 --> 02:04:22,920
I need you

2158
02:04:22,920 --> 02:04:24,920
You can fall asleep to those

2159
02:04:24,920 --> 02:04:26,920
They're a little too overstimulating for me

2160
02:04:26,920 --> 02:04:28,920
No, I like them

2161
02:04:28,920 --> 02:04:30,920
Wait, Ty, can I look at your cake?

2162
02:04:30,920 --> 02:04:32,920
I like pimple popping videos

2163
02:04:32,920 --> 02:04:34,920
Oh, I love those shoes

2164
02:04:34,920 --> 02:04:36,920
My cake looks like a guy jizzed all over it

2165
02:04:36,920 --> 02:04:38,920
I don't know what the flip I'm doing

2166
02:04:38,920 --> 02:04:40,920
White cream on it and stripping everywhere

2167
02:04:40,920 --> 02:04:42,920
I thought I was supposed to be Coco Kiss

2168
02:04:42,920 --> 02:04:44,920
Not Coco Piss

2169
02:04:44,920 --> 02:04:46,920
I don't know what I'm doing

2170
02:04:46,920 --> 02:04:48,920
You mean Coco Jizz

2171
02:04:48,920 --> 02:04:50,920
That was a good one

2172
02:04:50,920 --> 02:04:52,920
I think she's fading, guys

2173
02:04:52,920 --> 02:04:54,920
I think the man's fading

2174
02:04:54,920 --> 02:04:56,920
I've long faded

2175
02:04:56,920 --> 02:04:58,920
We should play past the ball

2176
02:04:58,920 --> 02:05:00,920
I'm so eepy

2177
02:05:00,920 --> 02:05:02,920
No, you can't be eepy

2178
02:05:02,920 --> 02:05:04,920
It's past my bedtime

2179
02:05:04,920 --> 02:05:06,920
I hate grandma so much

2180
02:05:08,920 --> 02:05:10,920
What?

2181
02:05:10,920 --> 02:05:12,920
You hate grandmas?

2182
02:05:12,920 --> 02:05:14,920
I love grandmas, they have the big heavy knockers

2183
02:05:16,920 --> 02:05:18,920
That's why you like grandmas

2184
02:05:18,920 --> 02:05:20,920
Not for the cookies and hugs

2185
02:05:20,920 --> 02:05:22,920
Like a MILF is fine

2186
02:05:22,920 --> 02:05:24,920
But a G MILF has experience

2187
02:05:24,920 --> 02:05:26,920
That's like two rounds of children to take care of

2188
02:05:26,920 --> 02:05:28,920
It's like a poop everywhere

2189
02:05:28,920 --> 02:05:30,920
We'll be a lord

2190
02:05:30,920 --> 02:05:32,920
ever having a jilf

2191
02:05:32,920 --> 02:05:34,920
I hope so

2192
02:05:34,920 --> 02:05:36,920
I'm already the jilf, did you guys see what I was wearing the other day?

2193
02:05:36,920 --> 02:05:38,920
I mean if they had a jilf

2194
02:05:38,920 --> 02:05:40,920
She could give gum gum

2195
02:05:40,920 --> 02:05:42,920
Oh yeah, you wear the jilf, I saw

2196
02:05:42,920 --> 02:05:44,920
Guys chat

2197
02:05:44,920 --> 02:05:46,920
I don't like my cake

2198
02:05:46,920 --> 02:05:48,920
Is it a gilf or a jilf?

2199
02:05:48,920 --> 02:05:50,920
Is it a gif or a jif?

2200
02:05:50,920 --> 02:05:52,920
I'm gilfin' off

2201
02:05:52,920 --> 02:05:54,920
I'm gilfin' off

2202
02:05:54,920 --> 02:05:56,920
I'm gilfin' off

2203
02:05:56,920 --> 02:05:58,920
What's up here?

2204
02:05:58,920 --> 02:06:00,920
I don't like mine either

2205
02:06:00,920 --> 02:06:02,920
I just submitted it because I was tired of looking at it

2206
02:06:02,920 --> 02:06:04,920
Ooh, a compiler

2207
02:06:04,920 --> 02:06:06,920
Really?

2208
02:06:06,920 --> 02:06:08,920
Ooh, I'll join you in platforming

2209
02:06:08,920 --> 02:06:10,920
I can't really jump

2210
02:06:10,920 --> 02:06:12,920
Oh god, I'm stuck under the cookie

2211
02:06:12,920 --> 02:06:14,920
I don't know what to do

2212
02:06:14,920 --> 02:06:16,920
I submitted my cake early because

2213
02:06:16,920 --> 02:06:18,920
I was proud of it

2214
02:06:18,920 --> 02:06:20,920
This is such better platforming

2215
02:06:20,920 --> 02:06:22,920
Okay chat

2216
02:06:22,920 --> 02:06:24,920
Also, also

2217
02:06:24,920 --> 02:06:26,920
I have to ask

2218
02:06:26,920 --> 02:06:28,920
Are you guys gonna go see Sonic 3?

2219
02:06:28,920 --> 02:06:30,920
I am, I am, I am

2220
02:06:30,920 --> 02:06:32,920
I have the Sonic movies

2221
02:06:32,920 --> 02:06:34,920
I have the Sonic movies

2222
02:06:34,920 --> 02:06:36,920
I have the Sonic movies

2223
02:06:36,920 --> 02:06:38,920
Go watch them together

2224
02:06:38,920 --> 02:06:40,920
They are good

2225
02:06:46,920 --> 02:06:48,920
We can say jilf

2226
02:06:48,920 --> 02:06:50,920
We can say jilf because it's like jif, right?

2227
02:06:50,920 --> 02:06:52,920
No

2228
02:06:52,920 --> 02:06:54,920
Jilf like jif

2229
02:06:54,920 --> 02:06:56,920
Oh these are good

2230
02:06:56,920 --> 02:06:58,920
There's so many cute cakes

2231
02:06:58,920 --> 02:07:00,920
I have to fart

2232
02:07:00,920 --> 02:07:02,920
Fart really bad, sorry

2233
02:07:02,920 --> 02:07:04,920
Just let it out

2234
02:07:04,920 --> 02:07:06,920
I'm scared

2235
02:07:06,920 --> 02:07:08,920
I like that one

2236
02:07:08,920 --> 02:07:10,920
This is hard

2237
02:07:10,920 --> 02:07:12,920
Kinda like this one on the end

2238
02:07:12,920 --> 02:07:14,920
These are really well done

2239
02:07:14,920 --> 02:07:16,920
This is a fun game

2240
02:07:16,920 --> 02:07:18,920
I wish I could rotate the camera

2241
02:07:18,920 --> 02:07:20,920
I wish I could pick all the cakes

2242
02:07:20,920 --> 02:07:22,920
That's the kiss right there

2243
02:07:22,920 --> 02:07:24,920
This is literally the meme of

2244
02:07:24,920 --> 02:07:26,920
Oh boy, two cakes

2245
02:07:26,920 --> 02:07:28,920
Oh boy, two cakes

2246
02:07:28,920 --> 02:07:30,920
I love cake

2247
02:07:30,920 --> 02:07:32,920
Actually now I don't, I just

2248
02:07:32,920 --> 02:07:34,920
I'm a brownie person

2249
02:07:34,920 --> 02:07:36,920
I love brownies

2250
02:07:36,920 --> 02:07:38,920
Especially the corners

2251
02:07:38,920 --> 02:07:40,920
I prefer brownies over cake

2252
02:07:40,920 --> 02:07:42,920
Yeah, I like that

2253
02:07:42,920 --> 02:07:44,920
Oh, you guys can see

2254
02:07:44,920 --> 02:07:46,920

Do you guys put the video on ice cream?

2257
02:07:50,920 --> 02:07:52,920
Wait did everyone make it through?

2258
02:07:52,920 --> 02:07:54,920
Yes

2259
02:07:54,920 --> 02:07:56,920
Yay

2260
02:07:56,920 --> 02:07:58,920
I'd say confidently, not really knowing

2261
02:07:58,920 --> 02:08:00,920
This one's gonna win

2262
02:08:00,920 --> 02:08:02,920
We all know that

2263
02:08:02,920 --> 02:08:04,920
Which one, the light pink one?

2264
02:08:04,920 --> 02:08:06,920
Yeah

2265
02:08:06,920 --> 02:08:08,920

It makes me feel like I'm kiss kiss fall in love

2267
02:08:10,920 --> 02:08:12,920
You know

2268
02:08:22,920 --> 02:08:24,920
I love that I could just

2269
02:08:24,920 --> 02:08:26,920
Automatically just set y'all off

2270
02:08:26,920 --> 02:08:28,920
I know kind of like

2271
02:08:28,920 --> 02:08:30,920
I know kind of the guitar part

2272
02:08:30,920 --> 02:08:32,920
But that's as far as I can like know it

2273
02:08:32,920 --> 02:08:34,920
You can play the guitar

2274
02:08:34,920 --> 02:08:36,920
Kind of, not really kind of

2275
02:08:36,920 --> 02:08:38,920
Sort of, and the piano

2276
02:08:38,920 --> 02:08:40,920
And the recorder

2277
02:08:40,920 --> 02:08:42,920
And the whistle flute

2278
02:08:42,920 --> 02:08:44,920
And the drums

2279
02:08:44,920 --> 02:08:46,920
Maybe it's because like

2280
02:08:46,920 --> 02:08:48,920
We put a little bit of red in yours

2281
02:08:50,920 --> 02:08:52,920
Like period blood

2282
02:08:52,920 --> 02:08:54,920
Well I mean

2283
02:08:54,920 --> 02:08:56,920
Well you know if you put period blood

2284
02:08:56,920 --> 02:08:58,920
In someone's food

2285
02:08:58,920 --> 02:09:00,920
That's like a love spell

2286
02:09:00,920 --> 02:09:02,920
In finding them for you

2287
02:09:02,920 --> 02:09:04,920
Yeah

2288
02:09:04,920 --> 02:09:06,920
Holy shit

2289
02:09:06,920 --> 02:09:08,920
Holy shit

2290
02:09:08,920 --> 02:09:10,920
How did the pink one not

2291
02:09:10,920 --> 02:09:12,920
Move forward

2292
02:09:12,920 --> 02:09:14,920
I don't like that

2293
02:09:14,920 --> 02:09:16,920
I don't know how I'm making it

2294
02:09:16,920 --> 02:09:18,920
I just really like

2295
02:09:18,920 --> 02:09:20,920
Is it me and Tova?

2296
02:09:20,920 --> 02:09:22,920
Yes, no

2297
02:09:22,920 --> 02:09:24,920
I really really really like

2298
02:09:24,920 --> 02:09:26,920
The one with the little

2299
02:09:26,920 --> 02:09:28,920
Poo Poo like on the table

2300
02:09:28,920 --> 02:09:30,920
You like my Poo Poo's on the table

2301
02:09:30,920 --> 02:09:32,920
Yeah I really like your Poo Poo's

2302
02:09:32,920 --> 02:09:34,920
On the table

2303
02:09:34,920 --> 02:09:36,920
You win!

2304
02:09:36,920 --> 02:09:38,920
Well

2305
02:09:38,920 --> 02:09:40,920
Time and frame on a good note

2306
02:09:40,920 --> 02:09:42,920
Good job TV

2307
02:09:42,920 --> 02:09:44,920
You did such a good job

2308
02:09:44,920 --> 02:09:46,920
Oh my god

2309
02:09:46,920 --> 02:09:48,920
I can't, the pink one should have won

2310
02:09:48,920 --> 02:09:50,920
What the hell?

2311
02:09:50,920 --> 02:09:52,920
Yeah right? It's so kiss kiss fall in love

2312
02:09:52,920 --> 02:09:54,920
Indeed, I can't

2313
02:09:54,920 --> 02:09:56,920
I hate gojo

2314
02:09:56,920 --> 02:09:58,920
Gojo

2315
02:09:58,920 --> 02:10:00,920
What does this thing say?

2316
02:10:00,920 --> 02:10:02,920
Nah, I'd win

2317
02:10:02,920 --> 02:10:04,920
Nah, I'm sigma

2318
02:10:04,920 --> 02:10:06,920
I feel like we need to have like a battle

2319
02:10:08,920 --> 02:10:10,920
Why is he playing cake?

2320
02:10:10,920 --> 02:10:12,920
Oh no

2321
02:10:12,920 --> 02:10:14,920
You know what's awful?

2322
02:10:14,920 --> 02:10:16,920
I think we're all dick sucking height to him

2323
02:10:16,920 --> 02:10:18,920
No!

2324
02:10:18,920 --> 02:10:20,920
Why would you say that?

2325
02:10:20,920 --> 02:10:22,920
I'm running away

2326
02:10:22,920 --> 02:10:24,920
Don't run away

2327
02:10:24,920 --> 02:10:26,920
It's true though

2328
02:10:26,920 --> 02:10:28,920
I don't want to be near him

2329
02:10:28,920 --> 02:10:30,920
I'm elbow height

2330
02:10:30,920 --> 02:10:32,920
I'm not closer to him

2331
02:10:32,920 --> 02:10:34,920
Why would I be like this?

2332
02:10:34,920 --> 02:10:36,920
I don't want to decorate

2333
02:10:36,920 --> 02:10:38,920
I want a platform

2334
02:10:38,920 --> 02:10:40,920
Let me platform

2335
02:10:40,920 --> 02:10:42,920
I think I'm going to tap out

2336
02:10:42,920 --> 02:10:44,920
I'm so tired

2337
02:10:44,920 --> 02:10:46,920
I will have to as well

2338
02:10:46,920 --> 02:10:48,920
I really think we should play again

2339
02:10:48,920 --> 02:10:50,920
I want to play more dress to impress

2340
02:10:52,920 --> 02:10:54,920
I'm not going to tap out

2341
02:10:54,920 --> 02:10:56,920
I'm playing roblox and now I'm like wide awake

2342
02:10:56,920 --> 02:10:58,920
I'm so easy

2343
02:10:58,920 --> 02:11:00,920
Maybe you can play with gojo

2344
02:11:02,920 --> 02:11:04,920
I'm going to play patch the bar

2345
02:11:04,920 --> 02:11:06,920
Because he is going to play it

2346
02:11:06,920 --> 02:11:08,920
I'm probably going to do

2347
02:11:08,920 --> 02:11:10,920
a drunk

2348
02:11:10,920 --> 02:11:12,920
A drunk

2349
02:11:12,920 --> 02:11:14,920
You're just going to do a drunk?

2350
02:11:14,920 --> 02:11:16,920
Okay, that was good

2351
02:11:16,920 --> 02:11:18,920
I've been drinking my vodka

2352
02:11:18,920 --> 02:11:20,920
So you know, I'm probably going to just

2353
02:11:20,920 --> 02:11:22,920
crossfade and like watch cartoons

2354
02:11:22,920 --> 02:11:24,920
It's fine

2355
02:11:24,920 --> 02:11:26,920
That's a nice idea

2356
02:11:26,920 --> 02:11:28,920
I hope you have lots of fun

2357
02:11:28,920 --> 02:11:30,920
I will

2358
02:11:30,920 --> 02:11:32,920
It's going to be awesome

2359
02:11:32,920 --> 02:11:34,920
So is everyone

2360
02:11:34,920 --> 02:11:36,920
ending and leaving?

2361
02:11:36,920 --> 02:11:38,920
Oh no

2362
02:11:38,920 --> 02:11:40,920
Okay, well then thank you for playing

2363
02:11:40,920 --> 02:11:42,920
I'm sorry if I was being really loud

2364
02:11:42,920 --> 02:11:44,920
I know

2365
02:11:44,920 --> 02:11:46,920
Oh shit, then should I not be playing this next round?

2366
02:11:46,920 --> 02:11:48,920
I am going to leave this game

2367
02:11:48,920 --> 02:11:50,920
so that I don't

2368
02:11:50,920 --> 02:11:52,920
I'm going to be playing patch the bomb

2369
02:11:52,920 --> 02:11:54,920
so loud

2370
02:11:54,920 --> 02:11:56,920
But I had fun, thank you for agreeing

2371
02:11:56,920 --> 02:11:58,920
to such a late time

2372
02:11:58,920 --> 02:12:00,920
for my sake

2373
02:12:00,920 --> 02:12:02,920
Yeah, of course

2374
02:12:02,920 --> 02:12:04,920
Need a lot to me

2375
02:12:04,920 --> 02:12:06,920
Thank you so much for it

2376
02:12:06,920 --> 02:12:08,920
We got to do this again

2377
02:12:08,920 --> 02:12:10,920
We got to do this again

2378
02:12:10,920 --> 02:12:12,920
This was a great time

2379
02:12:12,920 --> 02:12:14,920
Thank you for having us

2380
02:12:14,920 --> 02:12:16,920
Thank you CB for putting us all together

2381
02:12:16,920 --> 02:12:18,920
Yeah

2382
02:12:18,920 --> 02:12:20,920
Good night

2383
02:12:20,920 --> 02:12:22,920
Good night

2384
02:12:22,920 --> 02:12:24,920
Good night CB

2385
02:12:24,920 --> 02:12:26,920
Good night Char

2386
02:12:26,920 --> 02:12:28,920
Good night Mari

2387
02:12:28,920 --> 02:12:30,920
Good night

2388
02:12:32,920 --> 02:12:34,920
I'm so tired

2389
02:12:42,920 --> 02:12:44,920
Hello

2390
02:12:44,920 --> 02:12:46,920
Hi

2391
02:12:48,920 --> 02:12:50,920
I'm so tired

2392
02:12:50,920 --> 02:12:52,920
Thank you guys

2393
02:12:52,920 --> 02:12:54,920
for hanging out

2394
02:12:54,920 --> 02:12:56,920
Hello

2395
02:12:56,920 --> 02:12:58,920
If you're a raider, if you're still here

2396
02:12:58,920 --> 02:13:00,920
Thank you

2397
02:13:00,920 --> 02:13:02,920
I'm sorry I didn't see you guys at first

2398
02:13:02,920 --> 02:13:04,920
But I hope you guys

2399
02:13:04,920 --> 02:13:06,920
had a good time

2400
02:13:06,920 --> 02:13:08,920
I had a good time

2401
02:13:08,920 --> 02:13:10,920
It was fun, I want to play more

2402
02:13:10,920 --> 02:13:12,920
to impress, my spongebob was very good

2403
02:13:12,920 --> 02:13:14,920
I'm surprised I got

2404
02:13:14,920 --> 02:13:16,920
as many wins as I did

2405
02:13:16,920 --> 02:13:18,920
Ending on a high note

2406
02:13:20,920 --> 02:13:22,920
Yeah

2407
02:13:22,920 --> 02:13:24,920
I'm sorry

2408
02:13:24,920 --> 02:13:26,920
We kept talking over each other

2409
02:13:26,920 --> 02:13:28,920
I couldn't hear Chai

2410
02:13:28,920 --> 02:13:30,920
after the time

2411
02:13:30,920 --> 02:13:32,920
I feel so bad

2412
02:13:32,920 --> 02:13:34,920
Fia is asleep

2413
02:13:34,920 --> 02:13:36,920
Reina is asleep next to me

2414
02:13:36,920 --> 02:13:38,920
I don't know where Boomi went

2415
02:13:38,920 --> 02:13:40,920
I don't know

2416
02:13:40,920 --> 02:13:42,920
Fia just woke up

2417
02:13:42,920 --> 02:13:44,920
Hi Fia

2418
02:13:44,920 --> 02:13:46,920
Thank you for being in the world

2419
02:13:46,920 --> 02:13:48,920
Hi

2420
02:13:48,920 --> 02:13:50,920
You're so wiggly

2421
02:13:50,920 --> 02:13:52,920
Fia

2422
02:13:52,920 --> 02:13:54,920
Thank you for being in the world

2423
02:13:54,920 --> 02:13:56,920
Hi

2424
02:13:56,920 --> 02:13:58,920
You're so wiggly

2425
02:13:58,920 --> 02:14:00,920
You're asking for a big stretch

2426
02:14:00,920 --> 02:14:02,920
Big stretch

2427
02:14:02,920 --> 02:14:04,920
Big stretch for you

2428
02:14:04,920 --> 02:14:06,920
Big stretch for you

2429
02:14:06,920 --> 02:14:08,920
Big stretch for you

2430
02:14:08,920 --> 02:14:10,920
Almost called me

2431
02:14:10,920 --> 02:14:12,920
my own name

2432
02:14:12,920 --> 02:14:14,920
It's okay

2433
02:14:14,920 --> 02:14:16,920
I'm a

2434
02:14:16,920 --> 02:14:18,920
girl fell asleep

2435
02:14:18,920 --> 02:14:20,920
now

2436
02:14:20,920 --> 02:14:22,920
The apiest warrior

2437
02:14:24,920 --> 02:14:26,920
You're not annoying

2438
02:14:26,920 --> 02:14:28,920
You're fine

2439
02:14:28,920 --> 02:14:30,920
You're fine

2440
02:14:30,920 --> 02:14:32,920
Don't worry about it

2441
02:14:34,920 --> 02:14:36,920
I wish that I was more awake

2442
02:14:36,920 --> 02:14:38,920
because I felt like I would have been

2443
02:14:38,920 --> 02:14:40,920
a little bit more entertaining

2444
02:14:40,920 --> 02:14:42,920
to everybody

2445
02:14:42,920 --> 02:14:44,920
I was a little bit low energy

2446
02:14:44,920 --> 02:14:46,920
because it was a later stream

2447
02:14:46,920 --> 02:14:48,920
It might be the same

2448
02:14:48,920 --> 02:14:50,920
tomorrow because I think I have another later stream

2449
02:14:50,920 --> 02:14:52,920
No, wait, no, that's next week

2450
02:14:52,920 --> 02:14:54,920
I have two collabs

2451
02:14:54,920 --> 02:14:56,920
in one day and I'm like

2452
02:14:56,920 --> 02:14:58,920
Oh my god, why did I do that

2453
02:14:58,920 --> 02:15:00,920
but I wasn't paying attention

2454
02:15:02,920 --> 02:15:04,920
And I have FOMO

2455
02:15:04,920 --> 02:15:06,920
so I don't want to miss out on stuff

2456
02:15:08,920 --> 02:15:10,920
Yeah, tomorrow's ASMR

2457
02:15:16,920 --> 02:15:18,920
I'm just

2458
02:15:18,920 --> 02:15:20,920
It's been a tough

2459
02:15:20,920 --> 02:15:22,920
day for me today

2460
02:15:22,920 --> 02:15:24,920
because I don't feel good

2461
02:15:26,920 --> 02:15:28,920
My period is freaking

2462
02:15:28,920 --> 02:15:30,920
killing me, man

2463
02:15:34,920 --> 02:15:36,920
And I'm super tired

2464
02:15:36,920 --> 02:15:38,920
I've been like often on sleeping

2465
02:15:38,920 --> 02:15:40,920
I don't know why I'm so exhausted

2466
02:15:40,920 --> 02:15:42,920
I saw my parents today

2467
02:15:42,920 --> 02:15:44,920
I kind of just hung out at my parent's house

2468
02:15:44,920 --> 02:15:46,920
after I watered the long

2469
02:15:46,920 --> 02:15:48,920
and

2470
02:15:50,920 --> 02:15:52,920
I kind of just hung out

2471
02:15:52,920 --> 02:15:54,920
outside and just like touch grass

2472
02:15:54,920 --> 02:15:56,920
and just

2473
02:15:56,920 --> 02:15:58,920
I had breakfast outside

2474
02:15:58,920 --> 02:16:00,920
and then I was there for a couple hours

2475
02:16:00,920 --> 02:16:02,920
just like hanging out

2476
02:16:02,920 --> 02:16:04,920
and then my parents came home

2477
02:16:04,920 --> 02:16:06,920
and they're like, what are you doing here still

2478
02:16:06,920 --> 02:16:08,920
and I'm like, sorry, I just

2479
02:16:08,920 --> 02:16:10,920
wanted to be outside and your house is cleaner than mine

2480
02:16:10,920 --> 02:16:12,920
but

2481
02:16:14,920 --> 02:16:16,920
my mom gave me a sweatshirt

2482
02:16:16,920 --> 02:16:18,920
and it's so comfy

2483
02:16:18,920 --> 02:16:20,920
and I'm so happy

2484
02:16:22,920 --> 02:16:24,920
And yeah, it was nice

2485
02:16:24,920 --> 02:16:26,920
being around like plants and stuff

2486
02:16:26,920 --> 02:16:28,920
It's good to go outside

2487
02:16:28,920 --> 02:16:30,920
I wish a light flow

2488
02:16:30,920 --> 02:16:32,920
for a bath outside

2489
02:16:32,920 --> 02:16:34,920
Thank you

2490
02:16:34,920 --> 02:16:36,920
I hope that

2491
02:16:36,920 --> 02:16:38,920
it seems like you guys like the artwork

2492
02:16:38,920 --> 02:16:40,920
I posted today

2493
02:16:40,920 --> 02:16:42,920
I'm really glad

2494
02:16:42,920 --> 02:16:44,920
that you guys like it

2495
02:16:44,920 --> 02:16:46,920
and maybe I would

2496
02:16:46,920 --> 02:16:48,920
it seems like

2497
02:16:48,920 --> 02:16:50,920
I do miss being small

2498
02:16:50,920 --> 02:16:52,920
so maybe I would consider

2499
02:16:52,920 --> 02:16:54,920
something in the distant future

2500
02:16:54,920 --> 02:16:56,920
after like my 2.0 or something

2501
02:16:56,920 --> 02:16:58,920
like maybe like at least a little

2502
02:16:58,920 --> 02:17:00,920
cheapy model or whatever

2503
02:17:00,920 --> 02:17:02,920
getting that art was like

2504
02:17:02,920 --> 02:17:04,920
the highlight of my day

2505
02:17:04,920 --> 02:17:06,920
it was so cute

2506
02:17:06,920 --> 02:17:08,920
make us

2507
02:17:08,920 --> 02:17:10,920
so talented

2508
02:17:10,920 --> 02:17:12,920
they all just give her an idea

2509
02:17:12,920 --> 02:17:14,920
and she's just like boom

2510
02:17:14,920 --> 02:17:16,920
and I'm like, oh my god queen

2511
02:17:16,920 --> 02:17:18,920
yeah, pretty peak

2512
02:17:18,920 --> 02:17:20,920
would get pranked

2513
02:17:20,920 --> 02:17:22,920
by

2514
02:17:22,920 --> 02:17:24,920
yeah, it was so good

2515
02:17:24,920 --> 02:17:26,920
the queen

2516
02:17:26,920 --> 02:17:28,920
well like

2517
02:17:28,920 --> 02:17:30,920
yeah, I'm kind of bummed because

2518
02:17:30,920 --> 02:17:32,920
I did order the

2519
02:17:32,920 --> 02:17:34,920
design from somebody else

2520
02:17:34,920 --> 02:17:36,920
that's supposed to be like

2521
02:17:36,920 --> 02:17:38,920
Gyaru

2522
02:17:40,920 --> 02:17:42,920
school girl

2523
02:17:42,920 --> 02:17:44,920
cheapy

2524
02:17:44,920 --> 02:17:46,920
but I still haven't gotten any word back

2525
02:17:46,920 --> 02:17:48,920
and it should have been started

2526
02:17:48,920 --> 02:17:50,920
a bit ago so hopefully

2527
02:17:50,920 --> 02:17:52,920
actually let me see

2528
02:17:52,920 --> 02:17:54,920
I said they would

2529
02:17:54,920 --> 02:17:56,920
update me

2530
02:17:56,920 --> 02:17:58,920
they didn't respond to me

2531
02:17:58,920 --> 02:18:00,920
for a couple days and then

2532
02:18:00,920 --> 02:18:02,920
let's see did they respond

2533
02:18:05,920 --> 02:18:07,920
that would be so cool if they did

2534
02:18:08,920 --> 02:18:10,920
with the draft

2535
02:18:10,920 --> 02:18:12,920
they did not

2536
02:18:12,920 --> 02:18:14,920
we'll see

2537
02:18:14,920 --> 02:18:16,920
how that goes

2538
02:18:16,920 --> 02:18:18,920
my new mouse

2539
02:18:18,920 --> 02:18:20,920
my new mouse is here

2540
02:18:22,920 --> 02:18:24,920
and I'm actually using it right now

2541
02:18:24,920 --> 02:18:26,920
it's very good, it's so light

2542
02:18:26,920 --> 02:18:28,920
it's ridiculous how light it is

2543
02:18:28,920 --> 02:18:30,920
when I first took it out it literally feels like

2544
02:18:30,920 --> 02:18:32,920
I'm holding a piece of plastic

2545
02:18:32,920 --> 02:18:34,920
but it's not like it doesn't

2546
02:18:34,920 --> 02:18:36,920
feel cheap

2547
02:18:36,920 --> 02:18:38,920
I don't know how to explain it

2548
02:18:38,920 --> 02:18:40,920
yeah, it's already there

2549
02:18:40,920 --> 02:18:42,920
I already set it up in everything this morning

2550
02:18:42,920 --> 02:18:44,920
very satisfying click noise

2551
02:18:46,920 --> 02:18:48,920
madam is always on

2552
02:18:48,920 --> 02:18:50,920
yeah, it's really nice

2553
02:18:50,920 --> 02:18:52,920
thank you, thank you so much for the mouse

2554
02:18:52,920 --> 02:18:54,920
I appreciate you guys so much

2555
02:18:56,920 --> 02:18:58,920
yeah

2556
02:18:58,920 --> 02:19:00,920
tomorrow I'm gonna go

2557
02:19:00,920 --> 02:19:02,920
hang out with my parents

2558
02:19:02,920 --> 02:19:04,920
for a little bit

2559
02:19:04,920 --> 02:19:06,920
my parents know I can kind of

2560
02:19:06,920 --> 02:19:08,920
under the weather have a feeling good

2561
02:19:08,920 --> 02:19:10,920
so my parents are getting me Haitian food

2562
02:19:10,920 --> 02:19:12,920
which is nice

2563
02:19:12,920 --> 02:19:14,920
because I've been craving Haitian food

2564
02:19:14,920 --> 02:19:16,920
and then

2565
02:19:16,920 --> 02:19:18,920
I'm gonna hang out for

2566
02:19:18,920 --> 02:19:20,920
a couple hours and then

2567
02:19:20,920 --> 02:19:22,920
I think I have another

2568
02:19:22,920 --> 02:19:24,920
wait

2569
02:19:24,920 --> 02:19:26,920
I can't keep track of anything

2570
02:19:30,920 --> 02:19:32,920
yeah

2571
02:19:32,920 --> 02:19:34,920
and then I have

2572
02:19:34,920 --> 02:19:36,920
um

2573
02:19:36,920 --> 02:19:38,920
I was looking at the wrong week

2574
02:19:38,920 --> 02:19:40,920
and then I have

2575
02:19:40,920 --> 02:19:42,920
um

2576
02:19:42,920 --> 02:19:44,920
maybe I will come over later

2577
02:19:44,920 --> 02:19:46,920
because I said I would come over at like

2578
02:19:46,920 --> 02:19:48,920
two

2579
02:19:48,920 --> 02:19:50,920
and since my ASMR is at four

2580
02:19:50,920 --> 02:19:52,920
I'll go over at six instead

2581
02:19:52,920 --> 02:19:54,920
I'll text my parents

2582
02:19:54,920 --> 02:19:56,920
um

2583
02:19:56,920 --> 02:19:58,920
um

2584
02:19:58,920 --> 02:20:00,920
and so I can hang out with them

2585
02:20:00,920 --> 02:20:02,920
for a little bit while longer

2586
02:20:04,920 --> 02:20:06,920
just chill

2587
02:20:06,920 --> 02:20:08,920
and yeah

2588
02:20:08,920 --> 02:20:10,920
I still have to clean and stuff

2589
02:20:14,920 --> 02:20:16,920
I'm tired

2590
02:20:16,920 --> 02:20:18,920
yeah I'm spending time with family

2591
02:20:18,920 --> 02:20:20,920

02:22:18,920 --> 02:22:20,920
so it's cause it's medication

2652
02:22:20,920 --> 02:22:22,920
so thank god

2653
02:22:22,920 --> 02:22:24,920
um

2654
02:22:24,920 --> 02:22:26,920
like I know you guys like it when I'm like fuzzy

2655
02:22:26,920 --> 02:22:28,920
but like not like that

2656
02:22:28,920 --> 02:22:30,920
hahaha

2657
02:22:30,920 --> 02:22:32,920
um

2658
02:22:32,920 --> 02:22:34,920
um but yeah

2659
02:22:34,920 --> 02:22:36,920
this I hope

2660
02:22:36,920 --> 02:22:38,920
I'm sorry I feel really bad

2661
02:22:38,920 --> 02:22:40,920
I didn't give you guys more attention

2662
02:22:40,920 --> 02:22:42,920
and I'm sorry for my bad manners

2663
02:22:42,920 --> 02:22:44,920
to the raiders

2664
02:22:44,920 --> 02:22:46,920
cause I usually only get raided by my gen memes

2665
02:22:46,920 --> 02:22:48,920
so I'm probably gonna

2666
02:22:48,920 --> 02:22:50,920
DMEA and thank her for the raid

2667
02:22:50,920 --> 02:22:52,920
um

2668
02:22:54,920 --> 02:22:56,920
well I'll give you guys

2669
02:22:56,920 --> 02:22:58,920
attention lots of attention

2670
02:22:58,920 --> 02:23:00,920
tomorrow and when I say lots of attention

2671
02:23:00,920 --> 02:23:02,920
it means I'm

2672
02:23:02,920 --> 02:23:04,920
literally gonna scold you the entire time

2673
02:23:04,920 --> 02:23:06,920
in ASMR

2674
02:23:06,920 --> 02:23:08,920
I still have to think of more triggers

2675
02:23:08,920 --> 02:23:10,920
I think

2676
02:23:10,920 --> 02:23:12,920
I think I might do the same thing

2677
02:23:12,920 --> 02:23:14,920
I'll make it like a mukbang

2678
02:23:14,920 --> 02:23:16,920
and I eat a little bit

2679
02:23:16,920 --> 02:23:18,920
but also do like some degradation

2680
02:23:18,920 --> 02:23:20,920
and then um

2681
02:23:20,920 --> 02:23:22,920
I have to think of more

2682
02:23:22,920 --> 02:23:24,920
like some tapping stuff

2683
02:23:28,920 --> 02:23:30,920
yeah it was hard like I it was

2684
02:23:30,920 --> 02:23:32,920
like that's like the first time I had

2685
02:23:32,920 --> 02:23:34,920
like barely looked at chat

2686
02:23:34,920 --> 02:23:36,920
and I usually still pay attention to chat

2687
02:23:36,920 --> 02:23:38,920
and like read it so I can stay

2688
02:23:38,920 --> 02:23:40,920
like up to date with at least

2689
02:23:40,920 --> 02:23:42,920
what you guys are saying

2690
02:23:42,920 --> 02:23:44,920
but yeah I'm sorry

2691
02:23:44,920 --> 02:23:46,920
if I've been like a little bit goofy

2692
02:23:46,920 --> 02:23:48,920
the past few days now I literally know

2693
02:23:48,920 --> 02:23:50,920
why that is I like

2694
02:23:50,920 --> 02:23:52,920
don't know

2695
02:23:52,920 --> 02:23:54,920
I didn't know why

2696
02:23:54,920 --> 02:23:56,920
I was like feeling a little bit

2697
02:23:56,920 --> 02:23:58,920
off but it makes a

2698
02:23:58,920 --> 02:24:00,920
lot of sense I was locked in to dress to impress

2699
02:24:00,920 --> 02:24:02,920
that was so fun

2700
02:24:02,920 --> 02:24:04,920
I like when I whisper

2701
02:24:04,920 --> 02:24:06,920
repeat whisper triggers

2702
02:24:06,920 --> 02:24:08,920
hey why don't you guys

2703
02:24:08,920 --> 02:24:10,920
what triggers would you guys like

2704
02:24:10,920 --> 02:24:12,920
that would be relevant

2705
02:24:12,920 --> 02:24:14,920
I can love

2706
02:24:14,920 --> 02:24:16,920

2707
02:24:16,920 --> 02:24:18,920
so

2708
02:24:18,920 --> 02:24:20,920

2710
02:24:22,920 --> 02:24:24,920

2711
02:24:24,920 --> 02:24:26,920

2712
02:24:30,920 --> 02:24:32,920

02:24:40,920 --> 02:24:42,920
happens

2717
02:24:42,920 --> 02:24:44,920

2718
02:24:44,920 --> 02:24:46,920

work around it

2798
02:27:34,920 --> 02:27:36,920

so it might be a little bit of that

2803
02:27:44,920 --> 02:27:46,920

02:29:10,920 --> 02:29:12,920
to come and hang out with me huh

2843
02:29:14,920 --> 02:29:16,920
what happened

2844
02:29:16,920 --> 02:29:18,920
what would happen if I just

2845
02:29:18,920 --> 02:29:20,920
tucked you right in between

2846
02:29:20,920 --> 02:29:22,920
what would you do then huh

2847
02:29:22,920 --> 02:29:24,920
is there a script

2848
02:29:24,920 --> 02:29:26,920
you're most excited to release

2849
02:29:26,920 --> 02:29:28,920
I don't know

2850
02:29:28,920 --> 02:29:30,920
I haven't written them yet

2851
02:29:32,920 --> 02:29:34,920
and then the other ones

2852
02:29:34,920 --> 02:29:36,920
will be a little bit more sensual

2853
02:29:38,920 --> 02:29:40,920
um

2854
02:29:40,920 --> 02:29:42,920
or like deeper like my mommy

2855
02:29:42,920 --> 02:29:44,920
patreon voice

2856
02:29:44,920 --> 02:29:46,920
again

2857
02:29:46,920 --> 02:29:48,920
when I do do this voice it is mild

2858
02:29:48,920 --> 02:29:50,920
they put on so

2859
02:29:52,920 --> 02:29:54,920
oh pia just squeaked her sleep

2860
02:29:54,920 --> 02:29:56,920
it would be like the vampire

2861
02:29:56,920 --> 02:29:58,920
like I could do a really terrible

2862
02:29:58,920 --> 02:30:00,920
accent for the vamp

2863
02:30:00,920 --> 02:30:02,920
I wonder if I could do like a

2864
02:30:02,920 --> 02:30:04,920
a thread so that I didn't need an accent

2865
02:30:04,920 --> 02:30:06,920
I'll just speak normally

2866
02:30:10,920 --> 02:30:12,920
oh once brought you in

2867
02:30:12,920 --> 02:30:14,920
here

2868
02:30:14,920 --> 02:30:16,920
a new

2869
02:30:16,920 --> 02:30:18,920
morsel to play with

2870
02:30:18,920 --> 02:30:20,920
you're one of those weird ones

2871
02:30:20,920 --> 02:30:22,920
that likes to hang around vampires

2872
02:30:22,920 --> 02:30:24,920
for fun tucked you

2873
02:30:26,920 --> 02:30:28,920
well

2874
02:30:28,920 --> 02:30:30,920
you just smell so delicious

2875
02:30:34,920 --> 02:30:36,920
maybe a little like

2876
02:30:36,920 --> 02:30:38,920
well I think the accent would just come out bad so

2877
02:30:38,920 --> 02:30:40,920
a

2878
02:30:40,920 --> 02:30:42,920
British accent for the

2879
02:30:42,920 --> 02:30:44,920
yeah a British accent is a little bit easier

2880
02:30:46,920 --> 02:30:48,920
oh you smell

2881
02:30:48,920 --> 02:30:50,920
so delicious don't you

2882
02:30:52,920 --> 02:30:54,920
I could just

2883
02:30:54,920 --> 02:30:56,920
eat you up

2884
02:30:56,920 --> 02:30:58,920
or

2885
02:30:58,920 --> 02:31:00,920
I could

2886
02:31:00,920 --> 02:31:02,920
suck you dry

2887
02:31:02,920 --> 02:31:04,920
don't fight

2888
02:31:04,920 --> 02:31:06,920
you can't run away

2889
02:31:08,920 --> 02:31:10,920
yeah

2890
02:31:12,920 --> 02:31:14,920
man blood

2891
02:31:14,920 --> 02:31:16,920
man blood

2892
02:31:20,920 --> 02:31:22,920
alright British accent for the vampire

2893
02:31:24,920 --> 02:31:26,920
breathy breathy high pitched

2894
02:31:26,920 --> 02:31:28,920
voice for the goblin

2895
02:31:30,920 --> 02:31:32,920
so I really wanted to do like

2896
02:31:32,920 --> 02:31:34,920
hands on the desk here

2897
02:31:34,920 --> 02:31:36,920
I wanted to do like sarcastic

2898
02:31:36,920 --> 02:31:38,920
for the succubus

2899
02:31:38,920 --> 02:31:40,920
be like oh well you summoned me

2900
02:31:40,920 --> 02:31:42,920
what are you going to do about it

2901
02:31:44,920 --> 02:31:46,920
I suppose well

2902
02:31:46,920 --> 02:31:48,920
go ahead eat me out or whatever

2903
02:31:48,920 --> 02:31:50,920
that's the least you can do

2904
02:31:50,920 --> 02:31:52,920
just like kind of like sarcastic disinterest

2905
02:31:56,920 --> 02:31:58,920
does he guys like that

2906
02:31:58,920 --> 02:32:00,920
yeah

2907
02:32:02,920 --> 02:32:04,920
the sarcubus

2908
02:32:06,920 --> 02:32:08,920
and then

2909
02:32:08,920 --> 02:32:10,920
I don't know the voice for the slime

2910
02:32:10,920 --> 02:32:12,920
I think I just talk

2911
02:32:16,920 --> 02:32:18,920
you're interested in doing an audio bass

2912
02:32:18,920 --> 02:32:20,920
100% I would do an audio bass on that

2913
02:32:20,920 --> 02:32:22,920
Meryl that was a good one

2914
02:32:22,920 --> 02:32:24,920
got me all hot and bothered

2915
02:32:26,920 --> 02:32:28,920
bimbo slime

2916
02:32:28,920 --> 02:32:30,920
Fee are you okay

2917
02:32:30,920 --> 02:32:32,920
she's like squeaky in her sleep

2918
02:32:32,920 --> 02:32:34,920
she just dreams a little bit

2919
02:32:34,920 --> 02:32:36,920
a little ditzy yeah I was thinking

2920
02:32:36,920 --> 02:32:38,920
a little bit ditzy but like

2921
02:32:38,920 --> 02:32:40,920
but like demanding ditzy

2922
02:32:40,920 --> 02:32:42,920
like you know

2923
02:32:42,920 --> 02:32:44,920
you know how some people can be like dumb

2924
02:32:44,920 --> 02:32:46,920
but they like want you to do something

2925
02:32:46,920 --> 02:32:48,920
but they don't know what they're talking about

2926
02:32:48,920 --> 02:32:50,920
but they pretend they know what they're talking about

2927
02:32:50,920 --> 02:32:52,920
like

2928
02:32:54,920 --> 02:32:56,920
bit of an echo for the slime

2929
02:32:56,920 --> 02:32:58,920
yeah I think I would probably just

2930
02:32:58,920 --> 02:33:00,920
talk in this voice for the slime

2931
02:33:00,920 --> 02:33:02,920
slimes are slimy turns

2932
02:33:02,920 --> 02:33:04,920
that's a pretty cool thing

2933
02:33:04,920 --> 02:33:06,920
with the voice of the slime

2934
02:33:06,920 --> 02:33:08,920
well the slime is not going to take different forms

2935
02:33:10,920 --> 02:33:12,920
she's just going to be a slime

2936
02:33:12,920 --> 02:33:14,920
sounds pretty bang on for a slime

2937
02:33:14,920 --> 02:33:16,920
I am the slime

2938
02:33:16,920 --> 02:33:18,920
so

2939
02:33:18,920 --> 02:33:20,920
what do you got there

2940
02:33:22,920 --> 02:33:24,920
can you show me

2941
02:33:24,920 --> 02:33:26,920
no just

2942
02:33:26,920 --> 02:33:28,920
can't you just like put it in

2943
02:33:28,920 --> 02:33:30,920
why

2944
02:33:30,920 --> 02:33:32,920
are you resisting

2945
02:33:32,920 --> 02:33:34,920
wrap slimy hands around you

2946
02:33:34,920 --> 02:33:36,920
just do it

2947
02:33:38,920 --> 02:33:40,920
come on

2948
02:33:40,920 --> 02:33:42,920
don't be shy

2949
02:33:46,920 --> 02:33:48,920
that's a strange living

2950
02:33:48,920 --> 02:33:50,920
is going to slime girl

2951
02:33:50,920 --> 02:33:52,920
already have one here

2952
02:33:52,920 --> 02:33:54,920
slime she be

2953
02:33:58,920 --> 02:34:00,920
I wish I had time to get art made

2954
02:34:00,920 --> 02:34:02,920
for all of them

2955
02:34:02,920 --> 02:34:04,920
because I would totally do that

2956
02:34:04,920 --> 02:34:06,920
I did this thing I was talking to Marry

2957
02:34:06,920 --> 02:34:08,920
Marry was like oh you should try

2958
02:34:08,920 --> 02:34:10,920
like she will get like prepaid debit cards

2959
02:34:10,920 --> 02:34:12,920
to buy scab points and I tried that

2960
02:34:12,920 --> 02:34:14,920
it didn't work

2961
02:34:14,920 --> 02:34:16,920
so I'm pretty bummed

2962
02:34:18,920 --> 02:34:20,920
and people in Vigen just kind of work

2963
02:34:20,920 --> 02:34:22,920
like

2964
02:34:22,920 --> 02:34:24,920
I don't know

2965
02:34:24,920 --> 02:34:26,920
Vigen and Scab are just very

2966
02:34:26,920 --> 02:34:28,920
like Vigen

2967
02:34:28,920 --> 02:34:30,920
I don't really

2968
02:34:30,920 --> 02:34:32,920
there's a lot of westernized art styles

2969
02:34:32,920 --> 02:34:34,920
that I just I look

2970
02:34:34,920 --> 02:34:36,920
I don't really want a westernized art style

2971
02:34:36,920 --> 02:34:38,920
but

2972
02:34:38,920 --> 02:34:40,920
for scab they just take forever

2973
02:34:40,920 --> 02:34:42,920
so it's kind of annoying

2974
02:34:42,920 --> 02:34:44,920
slime be cotton slime

2975
02:34:44,920 --> 02:34:46,920
cotton bum

2976
02:34:46,920 --> 02:34:48,920
bum slime

2977
02:34:48,920 --> 02:34:50,920
a slime girl is my real self

2978
02:34:50,920 --> 02:34:52,920
can she be just be the entirety

2979
02:34:52,920 --> 02:34:54,920
of gen 4

2980
02:34:54,920 --> 02:34:56,920
I am the nun

2981
02:34:56,920 --> 02:34:58,920
I am the slime

2982
02:34:58,920 --> 02:35:00,920
I am the android

2983
02:35:00,920 --> 02:35:02,920
I am the

2984
02:35:02,920 --> 02:35:04,920
puppy play girl

2985
02:35:04,920 --> 02:35:06,920
I am the

2986
02:35:06,920 --> 02:35:08,920
I am just all of them

2987
02:35:08,920 --> 02:35:10,920
I am

2988
02:35:10,920 --> 02:35:12,920
I am the gen

2989
02:35:12,920 --> 02:35:14,920
I am the fourth gen

2990
02:35:16,920 --> 02:35:18,920
bring back the deep meme

2991
02:35:24,920 --> 02:35:26,920
um

2992
02:35:26,920 --> 02:35:28,920
Mrs. worldwide

2993
02:35:28,920 --> 02:35:30,920
puppy play but here I am as the puppy

2994
02:35:32,920 --> 02:35:34,920
well

2995
02:35:34,920 --> 02:35:36,920
if there was a puppy play person

2996
02:35:36,920 --> 02:35:38,920
I would want like

2997
02:35:38,920 --> 02:35:40,920
pet play like they would have to be sub

2998
02:35:40,920 --> 02:35:42,920
I realize none of us

2999
02:35:42,920 --> 02:35:44,920
are actually super subby

3000
02:35:44,920 --> 02:35:46,920
I just kind of

3001
02:35:46,920 --> 02:35:48,920
realize that because

3002
02:35:48,920 --> 02:35:50,920
it's

3003
02:35:50,920 --> 02:35:52,920
it's kind of weird like we're all

3004
02:35:52,920 --> 02:35:54,920
like very switches in video

3005
02:35:54,920 --> 02:35:56,920
there

3006
02:35:56,920 --> 02:35:58,920
like I don't really think

3007
02:35:58,920 --> 02:36:00,920
any of us are like

3008
02:36:00,920 --> 02:36:02,920
subby

3009
02:36:02,920 --> 02:36:04,920
because like everybody

3010
02:36:04,920 --> 02:36:06,920
yeah not by default

3011
02:36:06,920 --> 02:36:08,920
yeah we're all switcher

3012
02:36:08,920 --> 02:36:10,920
dom leaning which is very interesting because usually

3013
02:36:10,920 --> 02:36:12,920
like we be like

3014
02:36:12,920 --> 02:36:14,920
people are usually sub leaning

3015
02:36:14,920 --> 02:36:16,920
so uh

3016
02:36:16,920 --> 02:36:18,920
I bet for gen 2 we'll get like some super

3017
02:36:18,920 --> 02:36:20,920
subby girls and then like some really

3018
02:36:20,920 --> 02:36:22,920
hardcore dom a little bit harder than

3019
02:36:22,920 --> 02:36:24,920
like I know you guys

3020
02:36:24,920 --> 02:36:26,920
kind of want a harder

3021
02:36:26,920 --> 02:36:28,920
more aggressive dom

3022
02:36:28,920 --> 02:36:30,920
um

3023
02:36:30,920 --> 02:36:32,920
which I can be sometimes but I like

3024
02:36:32,920 --> 02:36:34,920
again

3025
02:36:34,920 --> 02:36:36,920
I want to be

3026
02:36:36,920 --> 02:36:38,920
able to help

3027
02:36:38,920 --> 02:36:40,920
strongy find people that

3028
02:36:40,920 --> 02:36:42,920
are more suited like I

3029
02:36:42,920 --> 02:36:44,920
want to be able to like

3030
02:36:44,920 --> 02:36:46,920
I hope

3031
02:36:46,920 --> 02:36:48,920
I honestly kind of want strongy to

3032
02:36:48,920 --> 02:36:50,920
in the um

3033
02:36:50,920 --> 02:36:52,920
questionnaire for like the

3034
02:36:52,920 --> 02:36:54,920
uh

3035
02:36:54,920 --> 02:36:56,920
the like the form that you fill out

3036
02:36:56,920 --> 02:36:58,920
like what your fetishes are

3037
02:36:58,920 --> 02:37:00,920
and like what your traits

3038
02:37:00,920 --> 02:37:02,920
are like what do you think

3039
02:37:02,920 --> 02:37:04,920
just so like you can find

3040
02:37:04,920 --> 02:37:06,920
personality traits

3041
02:37:06,920 --> 02:37:08,920
um there's a hard

3042
02:37:08,920 --> 02:37:10,920
yeah there's a higher dom

3043
02:37:10,920 --> 02:37:12,920
like I try my best

3044
02:37:12,920 --> 02:37:14,920
but I know I know it's not like

3045
02:37:14,920 --> 02:37:16,920
some people really expected

3046
02:37:16,920 --> 02:37:18,920
or wanted but I've already

3047
02:37:18,920 --> 02:37:20,920
come to terms with that and I think

3048
02:37:20,920 --> 02:37:22,920
a lot of people have too and just realize

3049
02:37:22,920 --> 02:37:24,920
that

3050
02:37:24,920 --> 02:37:26,920
I'm just

3051
02:37:28,920 --> 02:37:30,920
makes sense for streamer to be dom because streamer is

3052
02:37:30,920 --> 02:37:32,920
director of everything that happens

3053
02:37:32,920 --> 02:37:34,920
um

3054
02:37:34,920 --> 02:37:36,920
but like

3055
02:37:38,920 --> 02:37:40,920
honestly it's not

3056
02:37:40,920 --> 02:37:42,920
it's not hard being a sub on stream

3057
02:37:42,920 --> 02:37:44,920
either because like Amy's done it pretty

3058
02:37:44,920 --> 02:37:46,920
well with the whole like denial thing

3059
02:37:46,920 --> 02:37:48,920
but the thing is it's up to chat

3060
02:37:48,920 --> 02:37:50,920
for that stuff and sometimes chat

3061
02:37:50,920 --> 02:37:52,920
can kind of baby their sub

3062
02:37:52,920 --> 02:37:54,920
um

3063
02:37:56,920 --> 02:37:58,920
cause like I could just

3064
02:37:58,920 --> 02:38:00,920
totally right now be like oh

3065
02:38:00,920 --> 02:38:02,920
please please just let me

3066
02:38:02,920 --> 02:38:04,920
just let me splooge

3067
02:38:04,920 --> 02:38:06,920
that's all I want won't you please

3068
02:38:06,920 --> 02:38:08,920
I just want you to pound me

3069
02:38:08,920 --> 02:38:10,920
I don't deserve this I like

3070
02:38:10,920 --> 02:38:12,920
like um

3071
02:38:12,920 --> 02:38:14,920
uh

3072
02:38:14,920 --> 02:38:16,920
if

3073
02:38:16,920 --> 02:38:18,920
if I was

3074
02:38:18,920 --> 02:38:20,920
I would definitely um if I was

3075
02:38:20,920 --> 02:38:22,920
like cast as a sub

3076
02:38:22,920 --> 02:38:24,920
I would be very

3077
02:38:24,920 --> 02:38:26,920
riona

3078
02:38:26,920 --> 02:38:28,920
and like

3079
02:38:28,920 --> 02:38:30,920
beat the shit out of me like honestly

3080
02:38:30,920 --> 02:38:32,920
me and Amy are so much alike we were talking today

3081
02:38:32,920 --> 02:38:34,920
she's just I've been like

3082
02:38:34,920 --> 02:38:36,920
I talk to Amy a lot

3083
02:38:36,920 --> 02:38:38,920
speaking of what she literally messes me

3084
02:38:42,920 --> 02:38:44,920
she literally just messes me hello

3085
02:38:50,920 --> 02:38:52,920
that is really so funny

3086
02:38:52,920 --> 02:38:54,920
um

3087
02:38:54,920 --> 02:38:56,920
that's how you

3088
02:38:56,920 --> 02:38:58,920
heard you guys say hi

3089
02:38:58,920 --> 02:39:00,920

3091
02:39:08,920 --> 02:39:10,920
um

3092
02:39:10,920 --> 02:39:12,920
cause me and Amy have a lot of

3093
02:39:12,920 --> 02:39:14,920
stuff in common

3094
02:39:14,920 --> 02:39:16,920
um it was really cool I

3095
02:39:16,920 --> 02:39:18,920

um

3098
02:39:22,920 --> 02:39:24,920

3099
02:39:24,920 --> 02:39:26,920
from trying to clean

3100
02:39:26,920 --> 02:39:28,920

3174
02:42:50,920 --> 02:42:52,920
so fun we gotta

3175
02:42:52,920 --> 02:42:54,920
play

3176
02:42:54,920 --> 02:42:56,920
together

3177
02:42:56,920 --> 02:42:58,920
maybe with Icy

3178
02:43:00,920 --> 02:43:02,920
I think Icy would be good at it

3179
02:43:06,920 --> 02:43:08,920
how the hell did Icy I don't think she saw it

3180
02:43:08,920 --> 02:43:10,920
I'm like yo what are you gonna hang out

3181
02:43:10,920 --> 02:43:12,920
cricket

3182
02:43:12,920 --> 02:43:14,920
probably because it's late and she's asleep

3183
02:43:14,920 --> 02:43:16,920
it's probably because

3184
02:43:16,920 --> 02:43:18,920
it's probably because it's not her time zone

3185
02:43:18,920 --> 02:43:20,920
but I just expect to be answered immediately

3186
02:43:22,920 --> 02:43:24,920
alright

3187
02:43:24,920 --> 02:43:26,920
well

3188
02:43:26,920 --> 02:43:28,920
I think it's time for me to go

3189
02:43:28,920 --> 02:43:30,920
to bed

3190
02:43:30,920 --> 02:43:32,920
I'm gonna raid

3191
02:43:32,920 --> 02:43:34,920
Mari

3192
02:43:34,920 --> 02:43:36,920
what the hell just happened

3193
02:43:38,920 --> 02:43:40,920
oh my god I have like 50 tabs

3194
02:43:40,920 --> 02:43:42,920
open of the same thing because I don't know

3195
02:43:42,920 --> 02:43:44,920
what I'm doing

3196
02:43:44,920 --> 02:43:46,920
eee

3197
02:43:46,920 --> 02:43:48,920
redirect add

3198
02:43:54,920 --> 02:43:56,920
sometimes I have to

3199
02:43:56,920 --> 02:43:58,920
literally close out and reopen stuff

3200
02:44:00,920 --> 02:44:02,920
because

3201
02:44:04,920 --> 02:44:06,920
sometimes when you just subscribe to someone they don't show up

3202
02:44:14,920 --> 02:44:16,920
like Mari's not showing up

3203
02:44:28,920 --> 02:44:30,920
so weird

3204
02:44:32,920 --> 02:44:34,920
oh it's because she has a freaking

3205
02:44:34,920 --> 02:44:36,920
whitelist on Mari are you still here

3206
02:44:40,920 --> 02:44:42,920

3207
02:44:42,920 --> 02:44:44,920
whitelist on

3208
02:44:44,920 --> 02:44:46,920

3209
02:44:46,920 --> 02:44:48,920
live direct redirect list

I can't raid you

3211
02:44:52,920 --> 02:44:54,920
because you made it so that only

02:44:54,920 --> 02:44:56,920
people that you approve of can raid you

3213
02:45:00,920 --> 02:45:02,920

3214
02:45:02,920 --> 02:45:04,920

you might have to you might have to

3218
02:45:14,920 --> 02:45:16,920
just don't know all that

3219
02:45:16,920 --> 02:45:18,920
you might have to google that because my channel

3220
02:45:18,920 --> 02:45:20,920
was set up with that just already

3221
02:45:20,920 --> 02:45:22,920
that setting just changed automatically

3222
02:45:24,920 --> 02:45:26,920
so I have no idea

3223
02:45:28,920 --> 02:45:30,920
it is 1am I am fading

3224
02:45:36,920 --> 02:45:38,920
fading slowly

3225
02:45:38,920 --> 02:45:40,920
I'm surprised I'm not

3226
02:45:40,920 --> 02:45:42,920
like jacked up out of my mind because I'm drinking

3227
02:45:42,920 --> 02:45:44,920
gamer subs I'm drinking titty milk right now

3228
02:45:48,920 --> 02:45:50,920
I feel like this I got a new cup

3229
02:45:50,920 --> 02:45:52,920
and it's so freaking cool looking

3230
02:45:54,920 --> 02:45:56,920

02:45:56,920 --> 02:45:58,920

3233
02:46:00,920 --> 02:46:02,920
cool shaker thingy

3234
02:46:02,920 --> 02:46:04,920
yeah

3235
02:46:06,920 --> 02:46:08,920
see I wasn't subscribed to her

3236
02:46:08,920 --> 02:46:10,920
she doesn't have me on her whitelist

3237
02:46:10,920 --> 02:46:12,920
we're both

3238
02:46:12,920 --> 02:46:14,920
we're both in trouble

3239
02:46:16,920 --> 02:46:18,920
my neck is not connected to my body

3240
02:46:20,920 --> 02:46:22,920
transparent slime bunny girl madem

3241
02:46:22,920 --> 02:46:24,920
what

3242
02:46:26,920 --> 02:46:28,920
can I turn my opacity down

3243
02:46:32,920 --> 02:46:34,920
I

3244
02:46:46,920 --> 02:46:48,920
am seeing if I can

3245
02:46:50,920 --> 02:46:52,920
if I do color correction

3246
02:46:56,920 --> 02:46:58,920
now I just look like a ghost

3247
02:47:02,920 --> 02:47:04,920
I'm done

3248
02:47:08,920 --> 02:47:10,920

02:47:10,920 --> 02:47:12,920

spooky

3252
02:47:26,920 --> 02:47:28,920
spooky scary

3253
02:47:28,920 --> 02:47:30,920

3254
02:47:30,920 --> 02:47:32,920
sentures

3255
02:47:32,920 --> 02:47:34,920
down your spine

3256
02:47:40,920 --> 02:47:42,920
I was going to cover a song

3257
02:47:42,920 --> 02:47:44,920
and I think it might be too hard for me

3258
02:47:46,920 --> 02:47:48,920
because I have a lot to do this month

3259
02:47:48,920 --> 02:47:50,920
I think I might add something to my plate

3260
02:47:50,920 --> 02:47:52,920
I shouldn't have

3261
02:48:00,920 --> 02:48:02,920
yeah

3262
02:48:16,920 --> 02:48:18,920
maybe I'll do a ghost ASMR

3263
02:48:18,920 --> 02:48:20,920
ASMR

3264
02:48:28,920 --> 02:48:30,920
maybe I'll do that the first week of October

3265
02:48:38,920 --> 02:48:40,920
come let the children

3266
02:48:40,920 --> 02:48:42,920
