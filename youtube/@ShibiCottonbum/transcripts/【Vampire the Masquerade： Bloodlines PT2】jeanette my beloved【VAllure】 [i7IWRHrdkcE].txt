oh my freaking god
hello
it's me
your favorite, madam
it's so nice to see everybody
Wow, so many beautiful faces in this crowd.
My heart is going doki doki.
Oh, so many well wishes.
What do I do?
We forgot monetization pose.
Let's fucking go.
Oh my god, my back hurts.
Hello, hi.
Hello, yes.
Oh god, that scared me, I just get so red.
Yeah, but I hope you guys are doing well.
I'm doing lovely, minus I randomly got a migraine
and I'm like, what the hell?
I just woke up from a nappy nap.
To hope, and I went away a little bit
because of the nap and I took some acetaminophen.
You know a little bit about acetaminophen.
I really great acetaminophen.
I'm so excited.
Being, getting monetization and being a YouTube partner
has been a goal of mine since I was a teenager
making really stupid videos on the internet
and it feels really good.
I'm just healing my inner child.
I was crying so hard yesterday, tears of joy
and I know like it might not mean a lot to some of you
when you're just like, oh, it's whatever, it's this, it's that.
It's the principle of just like a long-term goal of mine.
It's like a decade in the works, just like,
even if it's a small milestone, but I hit it
and it means so much to me.
Like I turn the background, you might hear them running around
and Fia stole Boomi's toy
and so Boomi's not really happy about that.
But we're gonna have, it's so funny.
Strawni messages me and she's like,
when are we gonna have monetization stream?
Am I, Strawni, I told you, I said it was Sunday
and I don't know if she saw like literally above
like her message was me saying,
I'm having my monetization stream Sunday.
She's like, when are we having your monetization stream
is the next message?
I'm like, I think she just like sent it
and she's just like, did it, did it, did it.
That was funny, but yes, we're gonna have it Sunday.
I'm gonna try to get my,
I'm gonna try to get my toes done tomorrow.
I need them like book an appointment at the place tomorrow.
I should probably do that ASAP.
I probably should have done that before I fell asleep
and then we'll do it Sunday.
We're gonna be doing, I'm gonna have,
I need to set up my camera.
We're gonna be having thigh slash footsie cam.
I don't know how I'm gonna point it like under my desk.
That's gonna be so weird.
I don't know if that'll be allowed.
I'll have to think of like where I can put it.
Put the camera.
Cause I don't think YouTube will take kindly
to me doing like an up skirt sort of thing.
I don't know.
And I have to find, I don't know what to do with my tripod.
And I don't know if my camera will reach.
But yeah, I'll figure, I'll do all that.
Yeah, it'll be at my normal time at 4 p.m. on Sunday.
And then I can't even remember what else was on the schedule.
But yeah, and so we're doing that.
And we're gonna be eating some Japanese snacks.
You know how hard it is for me not to,
I've been holding on to this box of the soccer box
for like since I debuted now.
Cause somebody got it off my throne.
Cause I'm like, oh, I want to do this for like a,
like a membership stream or just like a stream in general.
And then I'm like, ooh, is it actually good for that?
And so we'll be trying some Japanese snacks.
I'm very excited.
I am not as dexterous as my mother.
So as my momay, I still have the Tito's on my desk.
I look like a fucking alcoholic.
If somebody came in to be like, wow,
what the fuck?
I just have a giant bottle of Tito's.
What did you get?
I haven't opened it yet.
I have no idea what's in the box.
What's in the box?
And then the week after,
I want to do a membership stream
or rewatch master of disguise.
I don't know how like watch alongs work.
I've never done a watch along.
I don't even know like how I'll get the,
like where we'll watch it.
I don't know.
I'll figure it out.
I have to ask Strani.
But that'll be on the day
that I can't remember off the top of my head.
I was getting really bombed.
If it's aimed at your feet,
will we get a cat cameo?
Oh, a hundred percent.
You guys will see my messy ass house in my cats.
So it'll be good.
Oh, maybe I can angle it.
So it looks like it's at my cats,
but it's actually at me.
Because it's like,
because Reina usually sleeps by my feet.
And so I can be like,
you guys can't see what I'm doing.
But yeah, it's if it's awesome.
I'm so happy.
I cried so hard yesterday.
It's like 1am and I was already half asleep.
You know, I woke up this morning
and I looked at my counter and I realized
I don't even remember this.
I made tea last night
and I don't even remember making tea.
I mean, it was just like left out.
And I was like, oh,
am I not totally enough to join the turtle club?
But yeah, it's going to be fun.
I am determined to also hopefully hit like 5k this week
or this upcoming week.
And it really sucks.
Because I was looking at my schedule
that my management sent me for my real job
and my hours are like really shitty.
And it would,
I would end up overlapping.
What the fuck is on my arm?
A bug?
Okay, no, it's not.
It's a piece of dust.
I was like, hello, sir.
Because I'll have to overlap with the Zera a lot.
Because I worked till like,
one day I worked till nine
and I'm just like, oh, I don't,
I can't do like an early morning stream.
And I just hope like,
I just, I don't know why they haven't made me part-time yet.
I think my boss called me right before I started stream,
but I didn't answer because I'm like, I'm doing stuff.
So I'll call back my store after I finished stream today.
But I'm hoping that the call was about like,
hey, we're just going to put you on part-time immediately
because I'm like, oh, great.
I'm working 11 to eight and 12 to nine.
That's so great.
Oh my God, every day this week.
Wow.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Oh, and you didn't schedule my proper days off
and you took my normal Wednesdays off.
Thank you so much.
Wow.
Thank you.
At least you got my Saturday days off right.
But yeah, I'll be going back to my job
after almost a three month leave
because your girl is depressed-y-s-y
and I also had a lot of health problems going on
and it was really affecting my work.
I was at risk of losing my job
because I was in so much pain that I couldn't go to work
because I love a fibroflare up
because I was so stressed out.
And they were just like talking to me
and be like, you need to work on your numbers,
your sales numbers.
And I'm like, I don't, I really don't give a shit.
Like I'm just trying to live right now.
And that's when Fiya was like not able to walk.
Her legs didn't work
and I had to take care of her and do all her meds
and also take care of myself at the same time
and then take care of Boomi and Reina
and still give them and love and attention
and then still also maintain relationships
outside of my job, like with my family and my friends.
And it was just, it was too, too, too much.
I couldn't handle it.
But I'm going back.
I feel better.
I'm in a better place.
Although if they don't switch my schedule over soon,
I'm probably just like, I might just quit
because I wanted to stay for reasons
but I don't think I'll be able to.
But we'll see.
Yeah, I'm very thankful
that I was able to get a temporary leave.
Yeah, Fiya is doing much better.
She is running all over my house.
She can jump.
She frolics about, she, what is she doing?
Boomi's just watching her like slam a toy
into my trash can and it's kind of funny
because she, I gave them both their favorite toy
with just a little spring toy
and she immediately fucking knocked it under my fridge.
And then Boomi got all sad
because then Fiya threw it
because Boomi likes to play fetch.
So I threw his and then Fiya got it.
And then Boomi looked at me like,
mama, what, why did you throw it to her?
I'm like, I didn't do it.
You were just too slow
and she got to it before you did.
But yes, we're making moves.
We're making strides.
It was so funny.
Do they keep you awake at night?
No, they wake me up early in the morning.
That's what they do.
They actually sleep with me really well at night.
Boomi becomes a sudden love bug at night.
They always sleep by my feet, on my feet.
Reina sleeps by my head.
That's Boomi right now, if you heard him, yeah.
What's the matter?
Where'd your toy go, sweetheart?
Did Fiya take it?
Did she knock it under the fridge?
Probably.
He looks so upset.
Yes, they're very dog-like.
But yeah, so I was gonna say
it was a really funny coincidence.
I'll read you off something.
I'm just gonna be ventriloquist for a second.
But I randomly got this notification from this thing
I used to be subscribed to about like,
it wasn't like horoscopes,
but just like things to like meditate on.
What the fuck has happened?
Hold on, I need to check on my cat.
Reina, are you okay?
Did you just fall?
Fall.
Fall.
I'm trying to find Reina and I'm walking around
and she jumped into my fucking laundry.
I don't know, my dirty clothes hamper.
And so I just look at her in the bathroom
and she's just staring up at me with her dark face
and big eyes like, hello.
I'm sitting and wallowing in your stink.
But the message I got says,
abundance and confidence and badly this is the finest times
where diligence can pay off.
Even if success isn't immediate, it will come.
You'll feel on track with some sort of measurable return
such as respect, greater self-worth,
financial gain, improved stability or security.
And I'm like, wow, that's so crazy
because literally all my dreams just came true yesterday.
Wow, when my dreams came true when I joined Vealer,
but you guys know what I mean.
It all goes on at 5 a.m.
It's supposed to be the end of the day.
You guys are quiet today.
What's going on?
What's up with that?
Everybody's so quiet.
There's like, Mathem, we're just here to hear.
We're just here to hear you, yeah.
I'm in a game.
I'm working.
Okay.
Scream, scream.
Okay, actually you just reminded me
because you just said you achieved your life.
I need a tweet that I am live.
Oh, I'm right now, oh my God.
She just jumped up on my nose.
Well, I hope you guys are having
a good productive day today.
Sorry, I'm just gonna tweet out on why.
For all my little habits.
Why?
But yeah, you can, you'll expect more later streams next week.
All I can say.
All right, I'm gonna go ventriloquist for a second
while I retweet at my all the count.
Did I even retweet it?
All right then.
I need to pull out a tharboop today, what the hell?
Hi.
Hello, hello.
I'm not being productive.
It's not a sheebie, sheebie, no, yeah, I'm being.
All right, I didn't get much done as of today.
I had a weekend off, so I'm good now.
Oh, it's good for you.
Very good for you.
No problem, arrange your schedule,
hope it freezes you, actually.
Yeah.
I would, I'll actually, I do,
I've always liked streaming in the middle of the day,
like people who have watched me before,
I usually actually streamed at like 12
or even 10 a.m. Eastern sometimes, a.m.
Cause then I just like stream all day and it's great.
Okay.
I'm gonna, I'm practicing today.
I am not gonna yapp as much.
Yeah, we're gonna get into the game now.
Yes, I'm very EU friendly when it comes to streaming.
If my game will load, it will.
I'm trying something new
because you're more energetic as there are times.
Yeah.
Maybe.
I don't know, actually.
I think because like they're,
cause I used on Twitch and like everybody
and their fucking mom would stream at,
come on, come on, they're probably gonna wake up.
Sometimes it doesn't show up until, well,
there we go.
Everybody was streaming and it would be like,
it would just be like 20 people,
people that I also like to watch myself
just streaming all at the same time.
And I just, I,
I just knew I couldn't compete with the time slot
being such a small creator.
So I just like to stream in the middle of the day
and it was fun and then I had a lot of EU friends.
What have I done with the real sheebie?
Game's on.
All right.
Whoopsie daisies.
Not even 40 minutes of yet.
Yes, I'm sorry to let you down.
I'll be honest because of my migraine.
I don't have a lot to talk about today.
And I was looking back at my body yesterday
and I realized I only played two hours
to call the lamb.
And then I just talked for four hours after that.
Oh, where'd my coffee go?
Let me grow my coffee.
If you guys are quiet, I'm quiet.
We're having a chill, the rainy day outside.
I might feel a little bit of thunder.
I'm in a good mood.
He he he.
Put my headphones on.
We're compensated with pull on all third-gamer movements.
Damn, the game is loud.
Okay, where was I? I was in the haunted house.
I think I might get new headphones because I wish there was a sort of transparency mode on these.
I feel like my ears are blocked when I play.
I don't like it.
I'm probably mad when it's hot, by the way.
I don't like it.
I'm probably mad when it's hot, by the way.
I don't like it.
Vampire madam is hot, by the way.
Oh, yes, you like vampire madam.
I wish to fuck your blood.
I said fuck.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Fuck.
V-sucky.
Whoa!
Focus on noise.
Alright, I remember what I was doing.
Okay, I'm here now.
Why am I so high up?
Can I like be a little bit lower?
Okay, none of these doors.
Okay, well, it seems like I go through here.
Nice.
Shower, no mirrors, because I'm a vampire.
I swear I'm already getting motion sick.
Digit.
I walked over to this and just shut off. Okay.
Uh, um...
Can you please give me time to react to things?
Oh my god, look at all the cobwebs.
Oh, she was waiting for me.
Ah, ow!
Fucking, no!
Damn it.
I can't dodge stuff.
Okay, I'm just gonna follow the lady.
Lady, come back!
Oh.
Okay, do I go in here?
Nope, nope, nothing in there either.
How do I reset the camera?
Because I feel like I'm like flying above her.
Camera, what?
Fit fine, okay, whatever.
I meant, mouse, oh my, oh, maybe.
Do it a little bit less.
What does mouse filter mean?
Lady, come back, you can blame it all on Sheepie.
Oh my god, this is a wraith whipping things that are in her rage.
No!
Well, if I can't go that way.
Um, I presume I...
Yo!
Oh, damn, I am...
I almost said I'm...
I'm acoustic.
That doesn't make any sense.
Oh, is it on fire?
That makes sense.
It's very sparkly, it's kind of pretty.
I like the purple flames.
Purple flames, purple flames.
Is there something that I should be doing here?
It's in here.
Not this fucking music.
Oh no!
Oh god, I can definitely jump over this.
Oh!
What the fuck?
Are you serious?
I didn't think you would kill me!
It didn't even give me, like, any warning.
Oh my god, I'm already like a third of my health is gone.
Um, which way was it?
This way?
No, this way.
No, this way.
Okay, it doesn't matter.
We're back where we were.
This game is very forgiving for...
Okay, don't touch the fucking purple fire.
Shibi, how about that?
All right.
Is that going to hurt me?
Ow.
Jesus.
This house is trying to kill me.
Okay, don't walk into that.
Ah!
Should I?
I'm going to save.
Because I feel like I'm going to die.
Can I?
Can I help myself?
Can I?
What the hell?
That bed is floating.
Excuse me?
Why is it in French?
Ooh.
It's the pen that...
Oh.
That bed is floating.
Can I?
How do I get down?
Ooh, is a pretty boat in the distance.
Do I just jump down?
Am I going to kill myself?
All right, time to go see Therese.
Can this door open any fucking slower?
Lovely.
Whoa!
Oh, I'm fine.
It's okay.
I survived that.
Where the f...
Where the fuck am I supposed to go?
Can I jump?
Okay, there's fire there.
So that's not it.
Oh, here we go.
There we go.
Whoa.
Thank you very much.
Um, I think I can like kill the guy ghost.
Whoa, I just thought it was weird.
I feel like I'm missing something in here.
All right.
Um.
Later.
Wait, I feel like there's a way to like...
Isn't...
I feel like there's something I have to do to like release the spirits
from the bad stuff or maybe it's just giving the pendant.
This is the hotel branch location.
In the basement, you said?
Hmm.
Hold on.
Journal.
What do I do with the fucking thing?
How do I release her?
How do I release?
I'm looking this up.
I don't want no ghost to be left behind.
How to release ghost vampire the Magrae Bubwim.
Hmm.
Oh, okay.
That's right.
I I've played the game before.
I just couldn't remember how to do it.
All right.
Let's let's bounce as well as popsicle stand.
No ghost left behind exactly.
Wait, isn't this thing supposed to attack me?
I didn't do it.
Ooh.
Oh, wait, I think when you go in here, that's when it attacks you.
What's in here?
Nothing I can use.
It's a giant ass protractor.
Oh.
It didn't attack me.
Soundtrack is bomb.
Please let me get out of this hole.
Or last time I played this, I got stuck in the hole and I had to restart.
Kitchen has a journal.
No, yeah, I already grabbed the journal.
All right, time to go back and talk to my beloved Therese and my beloved Jeanette a.k.a. Azula.
I don't know how to get back up.
So I think it's going to go anywhere.
Secret bobcat boss fight.
I love how I creep.
I'm sorry.
All right, let me.
What the hell?
Oh, what the?
What am I doing?
I was like, where am I?
I got disoriented from the Fire Nation.
Yes, it's the same voice actress.
Oh, hold on.
Salvatore dance for monetization.
I don't know.
Oh, hold on.
Salvatore dance for monetization.
Come on.
The fuck?
There you go.
Dude, that would be a great alternative outfit that this girl has next to me.
Got a hair member dancing with me.
Oh, what is this shit?
Hey, big spender.
Yeah, I'm dancing with harem.
Let's go.
Mosh, mosh, mosh, mosh, mosh.
I'm dancing with Skrillex and some random girls.
Wait, did you have a tattoo on his back?
I've never even noticed that before.
Boomi, what are you doing?
Boomi, no.
Oh my God, dude, what the heck?
I'll break it over.
It's just a bug.
Don't even see it.
I need the soundtrack for this.
Female, I'll scream.
Okay, can I leave?
Okay, later.
Fuck you, I don't like you.
I'm gonna go to the girl upstairs.
I don't like you.
I don't like you.
I don't like you.
I don't like you.
I don't like you.
I don't like you.
I don't like you.
Wait, how do I ...
No.
No, no, no.
No.
How do I get out of first person?

Ahhhhhhhhhhhh
I'm not Zoju Gjpan Baltimore
besides Therese, sorry
No, please, calm down
She's a successful one. Well, it's not fair. I'm not a fool. This club's success is just as much my doing as it is hers.
I understand, but I still can't give it to you, baby girl.
Do you understand what it's like to have your own flesh and blood ripping you apart on a daily basis for two lifetimes?
Can you?
I'm sorry to hear that, Jeanette, but I really need to give it to Therese.
Hmm, since you're so willing to rave that big spooky place for my darling sister, how about doing a teeny tiny favor for little trouble?
Hmm, what would put a smile on that cute, beautiful Harley Quinn-esque face?
Do you know Galerie Noir down the street? I happen to know there's a charity event being organized there.
