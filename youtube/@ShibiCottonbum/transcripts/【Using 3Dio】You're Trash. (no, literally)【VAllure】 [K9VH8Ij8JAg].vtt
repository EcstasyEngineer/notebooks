00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
You

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
You

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
You

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
You

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
You

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
You

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
You

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
You

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
You

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
You

05:00.000 --> 05:24.000
You

05:30.480 --> 05:33.960
Is that some better there's an echo

05:39.240 --> 05:41.240
What about now

05:51.040 --> 05:53.040
Why am I so bad at this

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
You hear that

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
You

07:00.000 --> 07:02.880
Okay

07:30.000 --> 07:47.000
Okay, no more. No, you don't get it easy. We are getting rid of the AC. No AC for you.

07:47.000 --> 08:03.000
If you're European, no AC for you. What do you like the AC? Why do you like the AC?

08:03.000 --> 08:11.000
Okay, fine. I'll put it back. Okay, here it goes.

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
Oh my god, that's too loud. Holy shit. Okay.

08:19.000 --> 08:24.000
We'll have it like a little...

08:24.000 --> 08:33.000
You guys aren't going to be able to hear the AC anyways because I'm going to put rain sounds on. So like, what the hell?

08:33.000 --> 08:55.000
I'm mad at the people who are going to make me help before you. No. Congrats on quitting. You're such a badass, but honestly, I wouldn't be able to do it if it wasn't for you.

08:56.000 --> 09:14.000
It's because of all the members that I'm able to do this. So I won't give credit where it's due. Yes, if you don't know, I quit my job.

09:14.000 --> 09:19.000
I just smacked my mouth against the mic.

09:22.000 --> 09:32.000
My ear, my hands, my background, and 9 o'clock Eastern time is when my phone goes off, so my ears are red.

09:32.000 --> 09:43.000
I quit my job. It was actually very, very hard. I will probably cry tomorrow morning.

09:44.000 --> 10:02.000
Because, um, I think I'm supposed to cry, but it's because I've been there for almost six years, and...

10:03.000 --> 10:24.000
Oh, goodbye AC, but I've been there for almost six years. It was probably one of the best jobs I ever had until the company started making some changes.

10:24.000 --> 10:37.000
It was time to move on. I had outgrown everything, and I tried, you know, applying for a part-time position and a different part of my store, but it was time, it was time.

10:38.000 --> 10:47.000
I wasn't a manager, but I was a temporary assistant manager for quite some time.

10:48.000 --> 10:57.000
And you see, good this time in the background. Nothing else has changed. I kind of still have a sense.

11:02.000 --> 11:07.000
I hope you have a good time at leverage of what you do.

11:08.000 --> 11:19.000
But I actually started, like, the ASMR, ASMR portion, because I have this whole role-play planned out.

11:19.000 --> 11:33.000
I'm not going to be reading any tonos or supas. You currently can't see any stream elements, tonos, or, and I turned off the words just so you can really immerse yourself.

11:33.000 --> 11:39.000
I want to do, like, a very serious role-play for you, a little bit silly, but mostly serious.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
I'm not going to go off the rails like I did last time.

11:45.000 --> 11:51.000
But yeah, we're ourselves in the picture.

11:51.000 --> 11:58.000
Yes, I have so many triggers next to me. Actually, I have to go cook it some more, but I love the other room.

11:58.000 --> 12:07.000
So, let me do that again. I'm sorry. Okay, I can't keep whispering. Let me just turn myself down for a second.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
Okay, I'm going to document this a bit.

12:12.000 --> 12:19.000
But, like, lower. So, yeah, it's really hard.

12:19.000 --> 12:34.000
I can't really express how difficult it is, even though it's...

12:36.000 --> 12:44.000
So, before I make this up, I'm going to read the tonos, don't know how many words, but don't miss the stuff on YouTube, so if you want to do that, okay?

12:45.000 --> 12:50.000
Turn myself up again? Okay, sorry.

12:54.000 --> 12:59.000
Yeah, I don't know how that works. I know...

12:59.000 --> 13:09.000
I know some people don't care about it at all, and some people like it right at the end.

13:09.000 --> 13:22.000
Yeah, yeah, it's... My parents are, like, very supportive. I'm obviously generally surprised. Sorry if I hear booby in the background.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
But, you know, we'll look for another job.

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
Guess what?

13:37.000 --> 13:46.000
Health and strength. He doesn't even know how. He just, like, moors. He just goes, like, whew whew whew.

13:47.000 --> 13:57.000
He doesn't open his mouth. He doesn't meow. Yeah, he mows. Yeah, he does. He does a lot of that.

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
Bring up his staring daggers at him right now.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Okay, he's ignoring me.

14:17.000 --> 14:21.000
Let me see if I can do something.

14:22.000 --> 14:28.000
Like, yeah, I just wanted to, oh my fucking god, rena, what the fuck are you doing?

14:29.000 --> 14:34.000
She just, she just jumped up on my desk and started sniffing the microphone.

14:36.000 --> 14:42.000
Basically, you just get a lot of chatting stream and great past and current don't knows.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
What really?

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
Maybe. Do you think you'd be good part of her?

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
Possibly.

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
I mean, I guess we could probably do something.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
She slipped down. She was, like, a little suspicious.

15:11.000 --> 15:17.000
Okay, so I'm gonna get rid of, like, some of the noise that's going on.

15:18.000 --> 15:26.000
It's getting deep off. I think it's, like, my neighbor's voice is going off.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
It just has a popping noise.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Whoa.

15:41.000 --> 15:45.000
Can you hear that? I don't know if you can.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
Huh? Okay.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
Now I see for you.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
Oh my god, I'm so sorry.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
Jesus fucking Christ.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
I'm so sorry.

16:05.000 --> 16:10.000
I know that this sounds the same on the 3D hotel.

16:11.000 --> 16:17.000
But, um, bearing off like it went down is more, that's actually the good thing.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
Louder.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
This is literally my reason.

16:24.000 --> 16:29.000
And then, like, the 3D picks up every little vibration.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
Hortics.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
And then I try to just always go, go, go.

16:34.000 --> 16:41.000
And just, like, we're, I mean, I'm still sitting on my desk just staring at the 3D.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
I'm gonna go over there.

16:52.000 --> 17:02.000
But I, you know, I wanted to be able to, um, just rub a bit so I can help my abs out.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
And I can check on you guys.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
You can see where my head is at, you know.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
Uh, she knows that you guys are with me, yes.

17:13.000 --> 17:19.000
Um, cause I just, I might, like, cause like, what I was thinking.

17:20.000 --> 17:28.000
I read the donos at the end in the soopas, but then I kinda like, cut it from the void.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
I don't know if that's like, inappropriate.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
Again, I know.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
I'm not used to this.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
So, please tell me what you think is best.

17:37.000 --> 17:41.000
I am willing to take any advice you can take.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
Um, hello everybody, just coming in.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Cause I don't have a special pass.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Yeah, can't we take on someone?

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
Again.

17:55.000 --> 18:01.000
But, um, I'm kinda in a world of emotions right now.

18:01.000 --> 18:07.000
So, it might be a little, um, next few days.

18:09.000 --> 18:13.000
Could leave a little bit of thought and cut off the beginning of the next day.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
Oh, that's a good idea.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
That's a good idea.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
I actually might do that as far as I can.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
I accidentally did that the next day.

18:22.000 --> 18:28.000
I like, come out, I just like tried to, I just like, saved it as a new video.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
People were like laughing at me about it.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
I was like, cool man.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
God damn it, I fucked it up again.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
Um, I might do that.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
I might do that.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
Good idea.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
Um, that's my good idea.

18:42.000 --> 18:47.000
But yeah, it's, um, I already had my job.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
I like, mentored a lot of people.

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
I was like, a new manager for a band.

18:53.000 --> 19:01.000
Um, I have amazing customers, amazing co-workers, um, on-state, amazing management.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
I won't lie about that.

19:03.000 --> 19:11.000
We have, like, a bet of minutes, but then, like, the values of the company kind of dramatically changed in this act.

19:11.000 --> 19:15.000
Like, we're all so close.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Um, my store was super huge.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
We had, like, over a hundred employees.

19:21.000 --> 19:26.000
Um, and I can, like, 100% send me that.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
Most people were by family.

19:28.000 --> 19:33.000
Like, it sounds stupid, but, like, they were really awesome.

19:33.000 --> 19:40.000
Um, and, and I started there when I was younger.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
And then, I kind of, like, grew up in the store.

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
Like, I mean, I had a lot of experience.

19:46.000 --> 19:51.000
Um, learning how to be, like, in the customer-based position.

19:51.000 --> 19:56.000
And it was just, it was just really awesome.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
Um, being someone to ask for a job site sale.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
I'm in the hallway with four of my best friends.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
I've had my own job, and all of them just left.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
And a lot of them drained me.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
And it was just kind of funny because now,

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
we've been following in our footsteps.

20:11.000 --> 20:18.000
Um, got up out of by someone.

20:18.000 --> 20:25.000
No, no, it's like, um, my company is humongous.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Uh, I'll say that much.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
Um, my ex-company.

20:29.000 --> 20:34.000
Um, it's all about what had happened.

20:34.000 --> 20:38.000
It's just, like, you know, corporations, for instance.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
You know how corporations are.

20:40.000 --> 20:47.000
They just, uh, sometimes, yeah, they intersect.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
They're corporations.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
They're corporations.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
And they need to make profit.

20:51.000 --> 20:55.000
Uh, sometimes, though, so there are values about their place

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
and their staff aside to kind of be like,

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
okay, how do we make more money?

21:00.000 --> 21:03.000
You know, to sacrifice that, maybe,

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
don't drink the staff as well,

21:05.000 --> 21:09.000
or maybe, like, you're in a hiring freeze for a long time.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
I mean, you did hire people,

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
but it's just stressed us,

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
that we're going to put us in other places

21:16.000 --> 21:20.000
just to want to be, that wasn't our only job, you know?

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
Like...

21:30.000 --> 21:41.000
But yeah, it's, it is what it is, you know?

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
If this one dude just struggled to hear me,

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
I bet he might be broke,

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
because everybody else seems fine.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
I'm so sorry.

21:49.000 --> 21:54.000
Yeah, they hurt themselves a lot, right?

21:54.000 --> 21:59.000
Like, a lot of people are leaving my company right now.

21:59.000 --> 22:03.000
Um, and, like, I'm not the first person,

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
like, me and one person,

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
literally left the same day.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
And then, I think,

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
and another person was telling me

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
they just put in their two weeks.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
It was so...

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
It is what it is.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
So...

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
I should probably come over here next minute.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
Yeah.

22:29.000 --> 22:33.000
Like, my reading, like, it wasn't normal reading.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
Um...

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
They had a very...

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Oh my god, I guess.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
So much noise.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
Why are you doing it?

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
Okay, there.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
They're playing with toys.

22:50.000 --> 22:53.000
Um, Raina is slowly sleeping on my desk now,

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
right next to my third deal.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
Um, like, I don't want to take a picture.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
She's sitting on my phone, never mind.

23:00.000 --> 23:04.000
Oh, my phone is lost due to the warmth that is raining.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
But they were all super happy,

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
and I was like, oh, I'm streaming full time,

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
because a lot of them, um,

23:10.000 --> 23:13.000
oh my god, they...

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
stopped.

23:16.000 --> 23:20.000
Um, a lot of them know that, um,

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
I'm a streamer.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
It's uncompressed.

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
Um, they don't let me know what I am,

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
but, like, they're cool about it.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
They're like, ah, I couldn't read it on the head.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
It's so cool.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
I would say, like, I know what made this person

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
not like my mom, me, duper on the Internet.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.000
Nobody knows what a fucking me, duper is, bro.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
You guys don't know the spell Raina or Boomi's name,

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
and then it's kind of funny.

23:50.000 --> 23:54.000
Um, yeah, she's literally alone on my desk.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
The first move is stream every day.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
No, I'm kidding, um,

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
I'm probably gonna start me streaming

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
in my normal times after this week again.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
Uh, like, 4 p.m. in the start time

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
and do, like, five days a week,

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
because I realize I need a time to relax

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
and I need a time to clean my house.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
It's the same fucking mess.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
I know, I know Raina,

24:15.000 --> 24:20.000
Raina, the queen in Espanol,

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
but she is Raina,

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
and there's someone that I liked

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
a lot in, uh, America's Next Stop Model.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
Hello.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
Uh,

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
A

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
I

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
A

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
A, Raina.

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
And then Boomi is Boomi from Avatar,

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Game of Omosha.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
Um, he goes by Boompster.

24:51.000 --> 24:55.000
Um, Metro Woman wants a more

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
game of word.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
Um,

24:58.000 --> 25:02.000
I don't know, he goes by, um,

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
oh no, he got an M, so sorry.

25:06.000 --> 25:10.000
Um, he goes by Boomi, Boomerton.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
He's still sp-spelled Raina Rock,

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
but it's okay, I love it best.

25:17.000 --> 25:21.000
And then Fia is M-I-N.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
Somebody thought of this full name

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
was Metro Boomin.

25:30.000 --> 25:34.000
I'm like, you think I need my fucking cat,

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Metro Boomin?

25:36.000 --> 25:39.000
Who the fuck names her cat, Metro Boomin?

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
What?

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
Raina?

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Is she fucking Australian?

25:45.000 --> 25:50.000
Although, um, in their, like, veterinary files

25:50.000 --> 25:54.000
like Fia is Fia the Deathbed Companion,

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
redacted, aka my last name,

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
and then Boomi is Boomi, King of Omoshu,

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
redacted, my last name.

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
So yeah, um,

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
I have allergies.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
Oh my god.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
Yeah, that's the problem,

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
but then Raina's just a big mama.

26:20.000 --> 26:24.000
Uh, she's also known as Jabba the Cat,

26:24.000 --> 26:28.000
um, Queen of the, um,

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
Mamas.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
But hey, Mamas.

26:35.000 --> 26:38.000
I'm gonna pick up other things from her.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
My dad calls her.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
Yeah, Jabba the Cat.

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
Well, my dad calls her a wombat,

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
although he gets a wombat.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
I've used some Happy Bar all the time,

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
so that's what it really means.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
What is...

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
I'm trying to think what was going to say ever again.

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
Boomi, King of Omoshu, my last name.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
Yeah, they're all wonderful kids,

27:21.000 --> 27:25.000
and, um, Raina used to have a sister named Soleil,

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
before she passed away,

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
and she was, um, because of Raina,

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
so like, Raina and son, um,

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
yeah, I miss her, she's great.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
But yeah, it actually reminds me a lot of her.

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
They have really similar personalities.

27:44.000 --> 27:47.000
And then, before that, um,

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
all my other parents were named after

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
Bible characters,

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
because I remember I grew up

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
with a religious household, so, yeah.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
I was like,

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
I don't remember it, like, church.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
I was talking to

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
me and my, um,

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
like, my best friend at the time.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
Mind you, we're like, fucking dead.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
And we're like, am I good?

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
If we ever had a son, we, um,

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
like, us together, we're like,

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
if I ever had a son,

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
like, well, we'd name ourselves.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
And I was, like, dead set

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
on naming my kid Artist Xease,

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
because the fucking badass name,

28:27.000 --> 28:30.000
like, just called art for sure.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
I'm like, oh, is it sure for Arthur?

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
No, bitch, it's sure for Artist Xease.

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
Kick Artist Xease.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
Form of Fusula.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Uh, uh.

28:43.000 --> 28:50.000
A-R-D-E-X-E-R-X-E-S.

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
Um, and then my friend was like,

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
I would just

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
call, call my kid Paul,

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
I'd like to go off this.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
Not those are loud.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Jesus, I brought you some

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
uh, rickets and some murder.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
Murder.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Oh, Judas.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
Great fun.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
I'd have a son so I could

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
be pulling your son from behind me.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Um, but then I decided

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
that if I ever got, like, a badass dog,

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
that was a boy dog,

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
I'd name my, um, Artist Xease,

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
or, like, some sort of just

29:34.000 --> 29:37.000
crazy-ass name.

29:38.000 --> 29:41.000
Um, and if I had a girl dog,

29:41.000 --> 29:45.000
I'd want a great pair of these,

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
and I want to name her Ducky,

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
and she's gonna make you cute and fluffy,

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
and she's gonna guard

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
all my livestock at my farm.

29:57.000 --> 30:00.000
I don't think Ducky's cute.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
I should blow my nose.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
Uh, mind your ears.

30:27.000 --> 30:30.000
Name the kids after

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
altering characters to be super cool,

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
actually. Oh my god, I just kind of,

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
kind of burped before.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
If I can name a me too,

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
don't worry, it will seem good.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Shut up.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
My son. Oh, good.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
Nobody cares about your penny,

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
is great.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
Hate, hate, hate...

30:58.000 --> 31:01.000
Now are you gonna see me play

31:01.000 --> 31:04.000
Elderdream DLC? Again, I don't

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
have an Elderdream for BC,

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
I played it on PS5.

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
It's a comfort game of mine,

31:11.000 --> 31:14.000
and I'm debating whether or not

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
I should embarrass myself by playing it

31:16.000 --> 31:19.000
online, um, and streaming.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
Just because.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
Like, I'm not good at games,

31:23.000 --> 31:28.000
Good at games, I like to take my time with them, so, you know.

31:30.680 --> 31:35.680
I don't know, I don't want people to see me try hard.

31:35.880 --> 31:39.080
Just watch Johnny play, she's hardly playing it this week,

31:39.080 --> 31:42.440
I'm pretty sure, next week, you know.

31:44.720 --> 31:49.040
I'm not like, I will play it from some, okay, maybe.

31:49.040 --> 31:51.800
Cause I'm sorry, but I don't wanna play

31:51.800 --> 31:53.920
another Crapstrap treasure lesson, like,

31:53.920 --> 31:55.360
this sounds like a beat on stream,

31:55.360 --> 31:59.160
cause the amp on black, bro, I was dying.

32:00.800 --> 32:02.960
Starting to link the shot color.

32:02.960 --> 32:05.400
I finally got my throat payouts,

32:05.400 --> 32:07.520
so I was able to order my shot color.

32:08.520 --> 32:13.280
So that should be it, at some point, I don't fucking know.

32:13.280 --> 32:17.960
Cause throat payouts take more than two weeks.

32:17.960 --> 32:22.960
I was the first person to have a shot color to my throat,

32:24.480 --> 32:26.720
and I'm the last person to get it.

32:32.080 --> 32:36.200
I think, I'm gonna move right now, cause she's,

32:36.200 --> 32:39.760
well, she looks really comfy, but I need to,

32:39.760 --> 32:41.840
oh, she fell asleep, I can't move her now.

32:44.640 --> 32:46.040
I can't move this old lady.

32:47.040 --> 32:49.480
I'm so cute, my god.

32:51.720 --> 32:54.440
She's a dead out of dead love right now,

32:54.440 --> 32:55.920
I'm not gonna lie.

32:55.920 --> 32:59.000
Perfectly dug to no tail on sight.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.160
Amazing form, dead out of dead love.

33:07.320 --> 33:11.760
I'm also debating from switching from headphones

33:11.760 --> 33:14.600
to, like, over the ear headphones to any ear headphones,

33:14.680 --> 33:18.640
I'm realizing that headphones kind of hurt my ears.

33:18.640 --> 33:21.640
I'm due at least to put my contacts in every time I stream.

33:25.200 --> 33:28.520
Because my glasses, plus, just, I don't know,

33:28.520 --> 33:30.320
do have a big head, maybe, I don't know,

33:30.320 --> 33:33.080
maybe I got a big head, not a big head's brain.

33:35.200 --> 33:37.440
I don't know, hope to one day eat.

33:41.240 --> 33:42.080
Perfect.

33:43.080 --> 33:46.480
That's the best, that's the best, that's the best.

33:46.480 --> 33:48.960
Double-tie a five-head old bookie-gulu,

33:48.960 --> 33:50.520
I mean, no, I won't, in my grip.

33:52.200 --> 33:55.280
But in short, before I start streaming,

33:55.280 --> 33:58.960
just know this is like a little role-playing new one,

33:58.960 --> 34:00.080
I hope you like it.

34:03.280 --> 34:06.000
Thank you guys so much for watching,

34:06.000 --> 34:07.600
do put my jobs in.

34:08.560 --> 34:09.640
Good to have done it.

34:09.640 --> 34:13.520
I want to help you, all my, my, members,

34:13.520 --> 34:17.440
strong, me, the girls, are so supportive,

34:17.440 --> 34:20.600
and like, they're really my personal cheerleaders,

34:20.600 --> 34:24.760
and I can't wait for them to, I don't know,

34:24.760 --> 34:26.080
I don't know, I want some job,

34:26.080 --> 34:28.040
but who doesn't help me on this, you know?

34:29.840 --> 34:33.280
Like, they, when I'm like, move out, or change jobs,

34:33.280 --> 34:36.080
or I hope they also get the opportunity,

34:38.360 --> 34:41.680
no, I don't want to, so I'll bring anything,

34:41.680 --> 34:44.400
because it is better to be free,

34:44.400 --> 34:46.880
I love my job, it just changed, you know?

34:46.880 --> 34:49.080
You got, you grow up, and you have to move on.

34:54.680 --> 34:59.680
Of course, okay, tell me if this is too loud, okay?

35:08.360 --> 35:09.520
Is that too loud?

35:10.800 --> 35:14.240
Still, oh, I'm so sorry, okay, let me turn that down.

35:14.240 --> 35:16.400
Okay, go, go, go, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

35:16.400 --> 35:18.400
I'm sorry, hold on, hold on, hold on.

35:28.040 --> 35:31.000
Okay, I'm gonna turn it down just a little bit more.

35:38.600 --> 35:41.520
Okay, how's that, is that better?

35:42.440 --> 35:43.280
Is that better?

35:50.040 --> 35:52.440
Okay, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,

35:52.440 --> 35:53.680
I mean, this sounds so good.

35:58.440 --> 36:00.200
It looks so good.

36:00.200 --> 36:02.020
Okay, a lot, a lot, a lot.

36:02.860 --> 36:06.340
A lot, you can break kisses,

36:06.340 --> 36:09.820
because you're about to be insulted a little bit, so.

36:12.020 --> 36:14.940
I need to be louder, is that true?

36:16.460 --> 36:21.100
I wish, sometimes, okay, YouTube, can you please,

36:21.100 --> 36:24.500
please put in channel points, so people can redeem,

36:24.500 --> 36:28.820
you're too loud, you're too quiet, I can be loud, okay, fine.

36:28.820 --> 36:29.820
Let me turn myself on.

36:33.020 --> 36:38.020
How's, how's that, is that, hi, oh, you got the AC,

36:44.740 --> 36:49.740
you got the rain, perfect, it's like the AC too,

36:54.220 --> 36:59.220
overbearing, or, my game, I'm like 18, it's gonna be real,

37:00.180 --> 37:02.180
it's gonna be real, okay.

37:02.180 --> 37:05.180
Dan, Dan, Dan, that's Rob, okay, okay.

37:10.060 --> 37:13.140
We're gonna just see what happens.

37:13.140 --> 37:14.900
Rain covers the AC, okay, perfect,

37:14.900 --> 37:18.500
so we got some white noise, I think the AC will be good,

37:18.500 --> 37:21.900
because I know this rain is copyright free,

37:21.900 --> 37:24.300
but maybe the AC will kind of like,

37:25.300 --> 37:30.180
be like the AI, well, I'm like a glaze,

37:30.180 --> 37:34.780
so I'll get this again, it's running out of talk to me,

37:34.780 --> 37:37.940
it was like, girl, you're gonna demonetize,

37:37.940 --> 37:41.100
left or right, you need, and so I've been putting,

37:41.100 --> 37:43.860
I'm gonna wear your cover up from now on, I'm sorry,

37:45.980 --> 37:50.980
can you copy me, people, copy right, rain, okay, yes,

37:51.860 --> 37:55.980
I know, it is what he said, it's what is true,

37:55.980 --> 37:58.180
people copy right, fucking everything,

37:58.180 --> 38:02.540
even if it's just fucking all beyonds, all beyonds.

38:07.220 --> 38:10.220
I'm scared, rain is gonna lean on my keyboard,

38:14.220 --> 38:19.220
I think that's good, hi, I don't know if you heard her squeak,

38:21.980 --> 38:25.980
oh my god, your breath smells me, look at that,

38:37.820 --> 38:40.820
why were you scared about a thunder coming after you?

38:40.940 --> 38:44.440
Oh, thunder, thunder, thunder, thundercats,

38:47.940 --> 38:50.940
it's really pretty outside, I wish I could take a picture

38:50.940 --> 38:54.460
and see if you guys would mind my location,

38:57.940 --> 39:00.940
it's like, big sky, and dusky, it's really pretty,

39:00.940 --> 39:04.940
It's like pink sky and dusky. It's really pretty.

39:08.940 --> 39:16.940
I almost named... I was debating whether or not it would be a Jidaro because she also kind of spots for some reason.

39:16.940 --> 39:19.940
She's like really light spots, but I can do that.

39:20.940 --> 39:21.940
Okay.

39:22.940 --> 39:23.940
Oh my god, I'm so sorry.

39:26.940 --> 39:27.940
Okay.

39:28.940 --> 39:29.940
Okay.

39:29.940 --> 39:32.940
I'll be ready to go get something.

39:45.940 --> 39:46.940
Delicious.

39:48.940 --> 39:50.940
I'll drink it warm on the heart.

39:52.940 --> 39:53.940
Okay, one second.

39:57.940 --> 39:58.940
Okay.

40:21.940 --> 40:24.940
40 minutes of the appage. Let's go.

40:28.940 --> 40:30.940
Sorry to put the phone right now.

40:30.940 --> 40:31.940
Okay.

40:47.940 --> 40:50.940
And we're starting.

40:58.940 --> 40:59.940
Hmm.

41:00.940 --> 41:04.940
So weird to find one of those things here.

41:05.940 --> 41:09.940
I've never seen anything like this before.

41:10.940 --> 41:13.940
What is this? Do you know what side of the rain?

41:16.940 --> 41:18.940
It's looking a lot like this.

41:18.940 --> 41:20.940
Can't tell what it is.

41:21.940 --> 41:28.940
It looks like a piece of trash.

41:29.940 --> 41:31.940
I'm pretty sure it is trash.

41:32.940 --> 41:35.940
And I still can't place it.

41:37.940 --> 41:44.940
I guess I'll have to do some closer inspection.

41:45.940 --> 41:50.940
I don't know if I want to get close to it.

41:51.940 --> 41:53.940
It looks like it smells bad.

41:53.940 --> 41:55.940
I'm pretty sure it smells bad.

41:59.940 --> 42:03.940
At least it brought my umbrella, so I won't get soaking wet.

42:05.940 --> 42:06.940
Okay.

42:06.940 --> 42:07.940
Let's see.

42:11.940 --> 42:12.940
Oh god.

42:12.940 --> 42:20.940
It looks so much worse and I'm close with it.

42:21.940 --> 42:23.940
I don't even know what that is.

42:24.940 --> 42:25.940
What is that?

42:25.940 --> 42:26.940
What?

42:31.940 --> 42:33.940
I'm going to go over here.

42:34.940 --> 42:35.940
Oh, yeah.

42:37.940 --> 42:40.940
It does smell bad.

42:41.940 --> 42:42.940
Gross.

42:46.940 --> 42:47.940
No.

42:51.940 --> 42:54.940
This has to be trash.

42:54.940 --> 42:57.940
It looks like crap.

42:57.940 --> 43:00.940
It smells like crap.

43:03.940 --> 43:09.940
It does make sense that it's near a dumpster in this alley that I've had.

43:11.940 --> 43:12.940
Okay.

43:16.940 --> 43:19.940
But I just, I can't tell what it is.

43:22.940 --> 43:24.940
Do I want to know what it is?

43:27.940 --> 43:28.940
Okay.

43:28.940 --> 43:29.940
Let me just...

43:41.940 --> 43:43.940
I don't know.

44:01.940 --> 44:03.940
I don't know what it is.

44:10.940 --> 44:12.940
Yeah.

44:40.940 --> 44:41.940
No.

44:58.940 --> 44:59.940
No.

45:04.940 --> 45:05.940
No.

45:10.940 --> 45:11.940
No.

45:36.940 --> 45:37.940
Wait.

45:38.940 --> 45:39.940
Wait a second.

45:41.940 --> 45:43.940
No, no, no, no, no, no.

45:45.940 --> 45:49.940
I like stuff I can't tell what it is.

45:49.940 --> 45:50.940
Okay.

45:50.940 --> 45:52.940
Let me make some notes.

45:56.940 --> 46:02.940
Maybe it's like an animal or something.

46:04.940 --> 46:06.940
Or a creature.

46:07.940 --> 46:08.940
No.

46:08.940 --> 46:09.940
No.

46:09.940 --> 46:10.940
A creature.

46:17.940 --> 46:18.940
No.

46:18.940 --> 46:19.940
Okay.

46:22.940 --> 46:23.940
No.

46:23.940 --> 46:24.940
No.

46:24.940 --> 46:25.940
No.

46:25.940 --> 46:26.940
No.

46:26.940 --> 46:27.940
No.

46:27.940 --> 46:28.940
No.

46:28.940 --> 46:29.940
No.

46:29.940 --> 46:30.940
No.

46:30.940 --> 46:31.940
No.

46:31.940 --> 46:32.940
No.

46:32.940 --> 46:33.940
No.

46:33.940 --> 46:34.940
No.

46:34.940 --> 46:35.940
No.

46:35.940 --> 46:37.940
No, I think so.

46:37.940 --> 46:39.940
Alright, let's see here.

46:45.940 --> 46:46.940
Yeah.

46:50.940 --> 46:51.940
Wow.

46:51.940 --> 46:52.940
Okay.

47:00.940 --> 47:03.940
Let me remember the pencil on some of them.

47:03.940 --> 47:28.940
I can sketch, what if I, oh yeah, shade right there, I'll just wrinkle it, whatever, that's fine, that's fine

47:29.940 --> 47:39.940
and now, yeah, now this, this piece of trash is way out of there, that's what I drew, we just sliced that

47:44.940 --> 47:51.940
now we're done, now we're done, I've never seen something so disgusting, I sliced that

47:51.940 --> 48:08.940
uh, now uh, it's like, it's like genuinely hideous, I can't stand to look at it, but like for science, I'll continue

48:09.940 --> 48:13.940
okay, a couple of rounds

48:20.940 --> 48:21.940
here

48:27.940 --> 48:29.940
shade, okay

48:30.940 --> 48:31.940
okay

48:35.940 --> 48:36.940
whatever

48:37.940 --> 48:38.940
shade, okay

48:44.940 --> 48:51.940
okay, one of its, I don't know if that's one, it's, it's just dirty, nothing more

48:51.940 --> 49:00.940
okay, wait a second, what do I think?

49:00.940 --> 49:19.940
okay, there's like something here, I think I can scratch it off, maybe

49:23.940 --> 49:24.940
let's try it out

49:31.940 --> 49:39.940
good thing I always have my tools on me to look at weird things and have the face that look like shade

49:39.940 --> 49:40.940
shade

49:55.940 --> 50:00.940
this thing is kicked on, this is like mud or something like that

50:09.940 --> 50:26.940
okay, it's just gonna take a little bit of time

50:26.940 --> 50:28.940
okay, let's try it on

50:31.940 --> 50:32.940
oh, oh, oh, okay

50:34.940 --> 50:43.940
this thing, you may have purchased this thing, that's making it look like shade, but it's made me expect it, so it looks so good

50:46.940 --> 50:48.940
it sounds kind of shiny

50:52.940 --> 50:55.940
oh, oh, oh, that's disgusting, never mind, let's not do that

50:56.940 --> 51:09.940
Okay, now we're getting somewhere.

51:09.940 --> 51:15.940
It's a weird, choking substance.

51:15.940 --> 51:20.940
It's a weird, trashy object.

51:20.940 --> 51:26.940
It reminds me of something here.

51:26.940 --> 51:49.940
I'm going to put it over here and just brush the victim.

51:50.940 --> 52:06.940
Yeah, what if I do it slower?

52:06.940 --> 52:17.940
If you think the stuff will melt away in the rain.

52:17.940 --> 52:20.940
I think it doesn't have a mouth.

52:20.940 --> 52:41.940
This thing was sitting in my mind.

52:41.940 --> 52:52.940
Interesting.

52:52.940 --> 52:54.940
My cats get out of here in the rain.

52:54.940 --> 53:06.940
I'm crazy.

53:06.940 --> 53:08.940
Gosh, this stuff is so cute.

53:08.940 --> 53:10.940
You have to put it on.

53:10.940 --> 53:13.940
I'm very, very curious.

53:13.940 --> 53:17.940
Oh, right here.

53:17.940 --> 53:20.940
This one.

53:20.940 --> 53:22.940
This one.

53:22.940 --> 53:24.940
This one's black.

53:24.940 --> 53:27.940
This one.

53:27.940 --> 53:35.940
Brush.

53:35.940 --> 53:37.940
Brush.

53:37.940 --> 53:39.940
To bring it away.

53:39.940 --> 53:51.940
Yeah.

53:51.940 --> 54:08.940
Better areas over here.

54:08.940 --> 54:31.940
How do you even know what you're doing with this stuff?

54:31.940 --> 54:37.940
What if this piece of junk is completely useless?

54:37.940 --> 54:47.940
What if this piece of junk is completely useless?

54:47.940 --> 54:57.940
What if this piece of junk is completely useless?

54:57.940 --> 55:07.940
What if this piece of junk is completely useless?

55:07.940 --> 55:17.940
What if this piece of junk is completely useless?

55:17.940 --> 55:27.940
What if this piece of junk is completely useless?

55:27.940 --> 55:37.940
What if this piece of junk is completely useless?

55:38.940 --> 55:43.940
Oh, no, that's my cat.

55:43.940 --> 55:45.940
No, no, no, no.

55:45.940 --> 55:59.940
Come on, pick it up.

55:59.940 --> 56:02.940
Just toss it off.

56:02.940 --> 56:05.940
That was a mess.

56:05.940 --> 56:09.940
Just toss it off.

56:29.940 --> 56:39.940
Just toss it off.

56:39.940 --> 56:45.940
Just toss it off.

56:45.940 --> 56:53.940
Just toss it off.

56:53.940 --> 56:58.940
That's pretty good.

56:58.940 --> 57:06.940
Oh, that was a big piece.

57:06.940 --> 57:09.940
Almost there.

57:09.940 --> 57:12.940
Barely done, so deep.

57:12.940 --> 57:19.940
Just a little deeper.

57:19.940 --> 57:22.940
Oh, this is really huge.

57:22.940 --> 57:24.940
Do I got it?

57:24.940 --> 57:28.940
Come on.

57:28.940 --> 57:30.940
What is this?

57:30.940 --> 57:31.940
This can't be trash.

57:31.940 --> 57:40.940
Okay, papers.

57:40.940 --> 57:51.940
Pretty trashy dust.

57:51.940 --> 57:52.940
Interesting.

57:52.940 --> 57:55.940
My color is green.

57:55.940 --> 57:56.940
Is it brown?

57:56.940 --> 57:59.940
Is it blue?

57:59.940 --> 58:09.940
Is it blue?

58:09.940 --> 58:19.940
Is it blue?

58:19.940 --> 58:29.940
Is it blue?

58:29.940 --> 58:39.940
Is it blue?

58:39.940 --> 58:49.940
Is it blue?

58:49.940 --> 58:59.940
Is it blue?

58:59.940 --> 59:09.940
Is it blue?

59:09.940 --> 59:19.940
Is it blue?

59:19.940 --> 59:29.940
Is it blue?

59:29.940 --> 59:49.940
Is it blue?

59:49.940 --> 01:00:09.940
Is it blue?

01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:19.940
Is it blue?

01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:26.940
Okay, one second.

01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:59.940
Okay, one second.

01:00:59.940 --> 01:01:09.940
Okay, one second.

01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:38.940
Looks a lot better than I did before.

01:01:38.940 --> 01:02:07.940
And the hearing is very interesting.

01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:17.940
Okay, one second.
