My favorite
MCR song
Wait, is it by MCR?
Or is it by Good Charlotte?
It's Teenagers by MCR
Black Parade was written about me
You know what one of my
Handles was when I was a kid
I was Mistress Muffin
XXX
And I was also like Lady Mistress
I don't even know what the I didn't even know what that meant
Welcome to the Black Parade
That's for like
That's like too mainstream for me
You know
I've been day drinking, no
I'm just talking in a different voice for my
For my emo face
Lady Mistress
Yubi is more a 3-2 for sweet or french time
Or
What's the song?
Local hack tries being cute
I'm not trying to be cute
I'm a vampire
Alright
I sleep in a coffin
And you know what
Let me describe my outfit please
I woke up this morning
I put on
My black lace panties
And my red and black lace bra
I slid on
My black tights
That were ripped
And I threw on an MCR T-shirt
In my favorite MCR red hoodie
I put on a choker with a bat on it
And I put on makeup
No foundation though
Cause I'm already so pale and white
You know
I'm not wearing pants
Don't cut yourself on the edge
Don't threaten me with a good time
We're uh
We're bringing
We're bringing emo
Doraike
Whatever it's called
My spark
This is the skin of a killer Bella
This is the skin of a killer
Come on Yubi
Let's go buy overpriced anime shirts
From Hot Topic
And split a marb red
Until we get kicked out
Hell yeah
You guys want to go to the mall
I want to get my clipped pierce at Claire's
I already got my nipples pierced there
You guys
You guys want to get your clipped pierce with me
What do you mean what
Spencers?
Oh yeah
We're going to go to Spencers
We're going to look at all the toys they got
You have an lobotomy appointment at Claire's?
Oh okay
I see that you're busy then
Yeah they do
Maybe I'll do a little bit of
A little bit of shoplifting
At Spencers
Maybe I'll
You know
Blow a car up
Maybe I'll just hate the patriarchy
Maybe I'll just post pictures of myself on my phone
And revealing poses
I don't know
I don't really care much about anything
You know
Cause I'm
Gothic
Can we go to the food court
And order five pounds of Chinese
No I only drink blood
I only drink human blood
I only drink muckled blood
I only drink muckled blood
I only drink muckled blood
I only drink muckled blood
Caring is for preps
Like we don't care here
Fuck caring
But somebody did send me one
What you might call it
Fanfiction that I thought would be funny to read
I didn't read the whole thing
They said it might be too spicy
And I'm like you know what
Fuck it we ball
It's not ebony
It's shibony
Okay
Get it right
You fucking prep
Need some blow yeah
I'll suck you guys later
Don't worry about it
I won't forget
Suck you all off
Anyways
She's so goth her head is attached
I know yeah right
I was uh
I was swinging from
My fan
But I'm still here
Cause I'm a real gothic
And I'm a vampire
And I can't die
Oh
Alright
Let's go to my bedroom
Welcome to my bedroom
How many of these do you fan fix?
Did I write?
None
I just relate to them a lot
You know
Okay let me turn my BGM down
I'm gonna turn on some other music
Actually no I think this music will be suitable
For this one
I have like some copyright free
Hogwarts themed music
Let me move up
Can I move this over?
Okay
It's a Harry X Drake one
This one I don't know
It's called First Encounter
Thank you to the
Anon that submitted it
The characters in the story
Slowly belong to JK Rowling
Whatever the fuck her name is
One of her brothers
So it's an unbaited
I don't know what that means
In some one shot
It was made in
2006
I need to move my
Camera tracker out of the way
Are you ready?
I wanted to make a fanfic
But I was worried it would be too long
And no one understands it
Since I was making a deal
I wrote
A 100 plus page fanfic
About how down bad
I was for Zetsu
From the Akatsuki
Cause I did a self insert
Of myself and every Shippuden
My character
My OC
And every Shippuden episode
That the Akatsuki were in
In Daedora
Naturally
In Kisame
Naturally
In Pain
And all of them
Especially Haydn
They're all hot
Okay
Her power levels
I also made a young justice
Fanfiction that was 80 pages long
And I self inserted my OC's
Into every young justice episode
And I shipped my character
Who was
By the way
Her name was Missy
And her last name was Chief
And so her hero name
Was Miss Chief
And she was
Or she would also
Would get the nickname
Pantamime
And
And she was a shapeshifter
That could
Temporarily
Take on the powers
Of who she shapeshifted into
That's why she was called Miss Chief
Cause she would usually just
Fuck shit up
I was like mistake
Missy Chief
Melissa Chief
Fucking hilarious
And I shipped myself
With Clarion
For some reason
Clarion the witch boy
I don't know
What was going on with that
If you know you know
Okay
Sorry yeah
Goth girls don't laugh
I'm laughing at
You actually
I'm laughing at your pain
Cause it
It awakens something in me
Nobody had no Clarion the witch boy
Yeah it was when
Was I a bottom in my gut
Nope
No I was mostly
I think I was
Because I was such a fucking loser
And shy
I think I made myself the top
In most scenarios
In my fanfictions
That I wrote when I was like 14
Yeah
Yeah well cause Clarion
The witch boy
Shows up in Young Justice
As like one of the first villains
And I just fell in love
I'm so edgy
I'm so edgy
Don't cut yourself
On all my edge
Or do cause we're being
Gothic and emo
Just kidding don't
Don't do that
I do not condone self harm
It was 40 years ago
Wasn't it?
Azeroth Metrion Zhentos
First time chatter
Hello hi
I like the anime that your name is from
What about harming others
Only what they say for
Anyways
Let's get started
I think I've yapped
Clarion is even using the comics
Is he?
Oh well he was using the show then
For some reason
Reina are you singing the song of your people
Sorry
She's a
She's listening to Good Charlotte right now
And she's singing to it
Cause she's she's Gothic
Okay
So we're gonna read first encounter
I think this is like a personification
Of like
Hogwarts
For some reason
Very Hattalia axis powers
Remember Hattalia
Oh my god
Hattalia
Hattalia
Sort of thing
Who the fuck is the skinware?
It's me
I'm Shiboni
Shiboni
Hogwarts side
And it echoed within its empty halls
His empty halls
Sorry again
It's personified
The students had all left for the summer
And he felt empty and useless
Hagrid was often around
Reina please
Reina what are you yelling about
I wish you guys could hear her
She's literally just going
Reina come here
She usually has a toy in her mouth
She's aware life is pain
What is that
Was it
Michael Fassbender
Oh
Like
Who is like
In
In um
Like X-Men first class
I think he's like
Life is pain
I can't remember
Who says that
This is a fanfic
I don't know
We'll find out
Hagrid was often around
But he was usually too focused
And bizarre animals
To fulfill the needs of Hogwarts
Professors would pop in occasionally
But being in magic school
Hogwarts didn't need much upkeeping
The little he did need was taken of
By
Filch
He shuddered
Causing small trembles
Of his halls
That was barely discernible
Except by the spiders and owls
He didn't care much for Filch
Wishing he could
Or Filch
I don't
Disclaimer
I've never
I've only read one Harry Potter book
I read the first one
If you're a Harry Potter fan
I don't really care
The books are mid
I never put the game
It's funny
Cause I love fantasy
But I never got into Harry Potter
I don't know why
Well
One cause my parents were like
It's demonic
And then my dad's like
I don't fucking care
Actually you can read it
I'm like alright
This is
Mid at best
I'd rather read something else
That's when I was like
Up picks up name of the wind
Picks up the magicians instead
Picks up American gods
He shuddered
Causing small trembles
He didn't care much for Filch
Filch
I'mma call him Filch
Pretty light fantasy
Wishing he could walk
Without his squib feet
Touching his magnificent stone floors
He had long since stopped trying to force his floors
Open to swallow Filch
And miss Nor
Miss Nor's hole
I don't know any of the characters
Besides
If he kept it up
He would be risking a prolapse staircase
And that was no laughing matter
The giant squid
Saw how miserable Hogwarts was
It was true
That he also missed his students
But for an entirely different reason
He missed their terrified screams
As he revealed himself
Rising from the murky depths of the lake
I didn't even know there was a
Giant squid in this
Fucking series
What?
Yeah I don't know what they mean by prolapse staircase
Don't ask me
His huge eyes
Stared mournfully
At his very large tentacles
At one time
He had dreams of being an actor
The larger he grew
Fucking a fucking actor
The larger he grew
The fewer agents and scouts would come calling
Until they finally stopped altogether
There wasn't much in the market for a squid
That would split a schoolgirl from stem to stern
Goddamn
I'm a squid now
He stared at his tentacles
As they moved gently in the current
Schoolgirls were out
A plan formed in his mind
And he swam to the surface
Hesitating momentarily
Before pulling himself from the water
It ran off his rubbery skin
As he made his way across the grounds
No humans were around
To witness the incredible trek
And no human would believe his eyes
Had he been a witness
Hogwarts watched the giant approach
Giant squid approach
And felt apprehension well up in his kitchen
I guess I should give it a British accent
What are you doing?
The words weren't spoken
But they were understood
Just trust me
The giant squid replied
Caressing Hogwarts's
Outer walls
I'm not ready
Hogwarts exclaimed
Trying to push the giant squid away
With his magic
Hogwarts
You're lonely
I can fix that
I'm lonely
We don't have to be
Besides
You can't go around manipulating your staircases
You know about that
Everyone does it
Sort of
That's besides the point
I've never
The temperature within
Rose in embarrassment
I'll go slow
I promise
He began to caress a window
Teasing it open
Hogwarts sighed
The fight leaving him
He relaxed
Allowing the tentacle inside
Where it brushed against the inner walls
Before settling on the stone floor
He fashioned the suction cups to the floor
Lifting the tentacle away
So that it pulled the floor
On the floor without losing its grip
Another sigh
Swept through the halls of Hogwarts
Oh, Merlin
That feels so good
His rapture tap turned to fright
As he fell the tentacle work its way
Into a second window
I don't
Trust me
It'll feel good
Remember this?
Wait, there's 80 pages?
You're lying
Okay, no, it's only one page
Okay, I was like, what the fuck?
I'm like, I'm not
Reading all of this
If um
If it's 80 pages
Trust me
It'll feel good
Remember this?
He pulled the suction cups a little harder
And Hogwarts grown
Do that again
The giant squid complied as he did so
Thrust the second tentacle in
Hogwarts shuttered
Coming very close to ending the fun
The giant squid backed off
Unwilling to finish so soon
He waited for Hogwarts to calm down
Before sending the second tentacle
To search the room
He felt a need to fill Hogwarts
As much as possible
And erased another tentacle
Caressing his outer walls
Running along windowsills
And tracing individual bricks
So caught up in the blizz
Hogwarts didn't even notice
The giant squid slipped in a third
And a fourth tentacle
This is incredible
Hogwarts breathed
This isn't even the best part
He held up his two longest tentacles
These can reach further than the room
They can go into your hallways
I want them in me
Are you sure?
They're quite large
Opera henshin rolled through his kitchen again
While he was deciding
The giant squid forced another tentacle in
You have three tentacles left to decide
What happens if I don't?
In response
The giant squid slid a sixth
Into another window
Two
He simply
And with a hint of warning
He said simply
With a hint of warning
Hogwarts could take them all
He knew he could
What would the other wizarding schools think?
Would Boba Tons allow a giant squid
To violate her?
Certainly not
If DermString ever found out
There'd be no end of teasing
The giant squid grew impatient
Slid a seventh tentacle into a window
Falled immediately by an eighth
One
Two
Times up
And you didn't decide
What?
But that's not fair
Why would this wizard get nuked?
This is perfectly normal
This is fine
This is Hogwarts the building
What?
But that's not fair
It's a simple answer
I guess I know
Now I'll have to punish you
And with that
He struck Hogwarts square
On the outer wall of a paddle-like tentacle
Hogwarts yelped
And tried to square it away
But the tentacles and his foundation
Held firm
The giant squid struck him with the other
Again and again
He spanked the naughty wizarding school
Until he sawed for the giant squid to stop
And still
He spanked
This makes me feel funny in my bathroom
You like my outfit?
Good
You better
I dressed up
All nice and pretty
For myself, not for you
You thought this was for you
Baka
Don't do anything for you
The giant squid finally stopped
But Hogwarts didn't have time
For reprieve before the giant squid
Forced his extra-long
Spanking tentacles into two separate windows
They slipped through the room
And forced the doors open
The pain only adding to Hogwarts' pleasure
The tentacles were in the hall now
Massaging the long stone
Tunnels
This was incredible
The giant squid thought
He really should have done this
At ages ago
Every tentacle was in a different window
No school girl
No matter how many movies she made
Could hold all tentacles
At ten tentacles at once
Each one moved differently
And with a different pace
Driving Hogwarts crazy
With the inability to match his speed
I'm just waiting to get a raid
Or someone like I know come in
And be like, hey, what are you?
Oh, God
He felt that familiar feeling
And doubled his efforts
Ink exploded all over Hogwarts
Some finding its way into the windows
He unified his tentacles
With the ability to match his speed
I'm just waiting to get a raid
Or someone like I know come in
And be like, hey, what are you?
Oh, God
He felt that familiar feeling
And doubled his efforts
And unified his tentacles
Somewhat completely unified
Can we focus on Hogwarts?
He must be close
Then it happened
Water shot of a faucet
Toilets overflowed
And bread set in ovens
To keep warm by thoughtful house elves
Exploded
Hogwarts shook violently
Into his foundations
Rousing filled from bed
And sitting house elves
And Mrs. Norris scrambling for cover
Even Hagrid heard the groan
Of stone and came running
They searched around the castle
And through the castle
But found no sign of intruders
Most perplexing was the stinky ink
On one side of the castle
Hagrid peered to the dark
Towards the lake
But was unable to see the ripples left
In the wake of the giant squid
The giant squid slipped beneath the waves
Wanting to grin even though
His beak was incapable
He anticipated a very short summer
Before the professors and students returned
So he had better make the most of it
And seen
That was it
That was a first encounter
By a
Lyrus Malachi
Sorry, Fia is also meowing
What is going on guys?
What you mean by that?
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
Come on guys
What you meowing about?
Yeah, I was hoping some of you guys
Would have written me some cringe fanfictions
Of me and the girls
Or me and
A harem
A harlot
No
Shook my
Shook my
Foundations
I'll tell you what
Cringe but Kino
Yeah, a singular
Member of the harem
Is called a harlot
Or a harlot
I can't write good
That's the whole point
Just wait
Just wait till I read my immortal guys
I was disappointed
There was no line as memorable as
Hold on tight spider monkey
Different franchise
But understood
Okay, let's go to the next one
I'm going to turn off my BGM
Because I'm going to put on some Hogwarts related music
Wait, I don't think I have the donation stuff on here
Hold on
Apologies
There it is, okay
Yeah, I didn't have the donation alert
So if you did, I'm sorry, I didn't catch it
So let me double check that real quick
Thank you bun for the tip
I vastly underestimated the level of
Cringe you desired
I have to recalibrate all systems
Precisely
I wanted the cringiest stuff
Okay, let me see
If I play this, will it work again?
Well, aren't you just this
Cool beads
Recalibrating
Recalibrating
Okay
Fuck
I want to cover this fucking dude
Get rid of this
Nobody needs to see fucking Eric
No males on the stream
Aw frick
Okay, so this is my favorite fanfiction
Of all time
I hope you will enjoy
Because I know I will
It's yeah, it's a pretty
You're right, I set a pretty high bar
For that
Feel, what do you want?
I know you don't need me
My cats are just little
That's what they eat, but yes
It's a cover up Eric
It's just pretty normie
Well, I feel like now it's normie
Can I?
If I zoom in more, it's just not going to work out
Where is
Is that too loud?
Yes, it is named after the
Evanescent song
It's a bit loud
Half the text in blue is because
It's like
They'll
They have like corrections and stuff
In fact, I can turn that off
So now
He doesn't do that
Seems okay
Bring it down a tad
But
Titans
No, it's
Harry Potter inspired background study music
Fall vibes
Hogwarts music inspired
And it is copy
Right
Copyright free and royalty free
You're more of a going under kind of guy
I'm going under
Oh my god, Fia
What the hell are you doing?
You're going to burn yourself on my team
Are you trying to kill yourself?
Fia
She was like
Accidentally kicked me in the face
I was trying to put her down
Turn this down
We're good, we're good
Wait, did that correct to the grammar?
Because I don't
I can't
I have to read it
With
Without the grammar correction
I want the original
Okay, this is the original
Evanescent is a great
It was a great group
We are reading my immortal

That's how I got my name with purple streaks and red tips that reaches my mid back and icy blue eyes like

But I wish I was because he's a major fucking hottie. I'm a vampire, but my teeth are straight and white
I have pale white skin
I'm also a witch and I go to a magic school called Hogwarts in England where I'm in the seventh year
I'm 17. I'm golf in case you couldn't tell with my floating head every which way
And I wear mostly black I love hot topic and I buy all my clothes from there
For example today
I was working up wearing a black corset with matching lace around it and a black leather miniskirt pink fishnets in black combat boots
I was wearing black lipstick white foundation black eyeliner and red eyeshadow
I was walking outside Hogwarts. It was snowing and raining so there was no sun
Which I was very happy about a lot of prep stared at me. I put my middle finger up at them
Hey, abony
Shouted a voice. I looked up. It was drako malphoy

The next day I woke up in my bedroom. It was snowing and raining again
I opened the door of my coffin and drank some blood from a bottle I had
My coffin was black ebony and inside was hot pink velvet with black lace on the ends
I got on my coffin and took off my giant and I'm gonna say I'm not gonna correct anything that she says
And I took off my giant mcr t-shirt, which I use for pajamas
Instead I put on black leather dress a pentagram necklace combat boots and black fishnets on
I put on four pairs of earrings and my pierced ears and put my hair in kind of a messy bun
My friend willow
This is like Irel friend woke up and then grinned at me
She flipped her long waist length raven black hair with pink streaks and opened her four screen eyes
She put on her maryland manson t-shirt with a black mini fishnets pointy hide-heeled boots
We put on her makeup black lipstick without foundation and black eyeliner
I'm just gonna use my normal voice for willow because she doesn't show up too much
Oh my fucking god, I saw you talking to drago mouthful yesterday. She said excitedly. Yeah, so I said blushing
Do you like drago?
She asked as we went out of the Slytherin common room and into of course their Slytherin and into the gray hall
No, I so fucking don't
Yeah, right. She exclaimed
Just then drago walked up to me
Hi, he said
Hi, I replied
alertly
Guess what he said
What I asked well
Good charlotte are having a concert in hogsmeade. He told me
Oh my fucking god, I screamed
I loved you see they're my favorite band besides mcr
Well, do you want to go out with me wait?
Well, do you want to go with me he asked I gasped
I'm not gonna read all the office notes
On the night of the concert I might just read like the exposition in my normal voice
On the night of the concert I put on my black lace up boots with high heels
God fucking damn she she has to tell you how well she dresses
Underneath them are ripped red fishnets
Then I put on a black leather mini dress with all this corset stuff on the back and the front
I put on matching fishnet on my arm
Arms I straightened my hair and made it look all spiky. I felt a little depressed. So then I slit one of my wrists
I read a depressing book while I waited for it to stop bleeding and I listened to this gc
I painted my nails black and put on tons of black eyeliner
Then I put on some black lipstick. I didn't put on fedation because I was pale anyways
I don't know what happened to the rest of the time before that, but okay
I drank some human blood. So I was ready to go to the concert
Spiky like Goku
I went outside drago was hold on actually I should put a disclaimer for that. Yeah
I
Disclaimer trigger warning
She does slitter wrist a lot
Vegeta ass hairline take a sip of tea

Went outside drago was waiting there in front of his flying car
He was wearing a simple planned t-shirt. They would play at the show too
Baggy black skater pants black nail polish and a little eyeliner
others note
A lot felt cool boys wear it. Okay
Hi drago. I said under the depressed voice
Hi bunny. He said back
We walked into his into his flying black mercedes benz the license plate said 666 and flew to the place with the concert
On the way we listened excitedly to good charlotte and maryland manson
We both smoked cigarettes and drugs
When we got there we both hopped out of the car
We went to the mosh pit at the front of the stage and jumped up and down as we listened to good charlotte
We smoked some drugs
Uh
I don't know how the song goes so i'm just gonna sing it badly
You come in cold you covered in blood
They're all so happy you've arrived the doctor cuts your cord hands you to your mom
She sets you free to this live

Joel is so fucking hot
I said to drago pointing to him as he sung filling the club with his amazing voice
Suddenly drago looks sad
What's wrong? I asked his mom to the music then I caught on
Hey, it's okay. I don't like him better than you I said
Really asked drago sensitively and he put around his arm around me all protective
Really I said besides I don't even know joel and he's going out with hillary fucking duff
I fucking hate that little bitch. I said disgustedly thinking of her ugly blonde face
The night went on really well and I had a great time so did drago
After the concert we drank some beer and asked benji and joel for their autographs and photos with them
We got gc concertees drago and I crawled back into the mercedes-benz
But drago didn't go back to hogwarts instead he drove the car into
The forbidden forest

I walk I don't know were they still in the air because that okay
I walked out of it to curiously
What the fucking hell I asked angrily
Ebony he asked
What I snapped
Draco leaned in extra close
And I looked into his gothic red eyes
He was wearing color contacts
Which revealed so much depressing sorrow and evilness and suddenly I didn't feel mad anymore
And then justice
Suddenly just as I
Draco kissed me passionately
Draco climbed on top of me
We start to make out keenly against a tree
He took off my top and I took off his clothes
I even took off my bra
Then he put his thingy in my new you know what we did it for the first time

It was Dumbledore I need to make a note somebody make a note of all the voices belong to who
Dumbledore made me made Andrako and I follow him he kept shouting I was angrily
You ludicrous fools he shouted I started to cry tears of blood down my pallid face
Draco comforted me
When we went back to the castle Dumbledore took us to Professor Snape and Professor McGonagall who were both fucking very angry
They were having sexual intercourse in the forbidden forest I'm sorry I'm like goofy
They were having sexual intercourse
These fucking kids
They were having sexual intercourse in the forbidden forest
Iha he yelled in a furious voice
Why did you do such a thing you mediocre dumpsies
Asked Professor McGonagall
How dare you
Demanded Professor Snape I can't do a Snape voice
How dare you
Mickey
How dare you
Andrako shrieked because I love her
Wait why am I British
Because I love her
Patron voice
Everyone was quiet
Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall still looked mad but Professor Snape said
Fine very well
You may go up to your rooms
Snape never sleep
Well Harry Potter
Picking noise
Potter puppet pals man
Bring you back
Are you okay Abany
Draco asked me gently
Yeah I guess
I lied
I went to the girls dorm and brushed my teeth and my hair
And chained into a low-cut black floor-length dress with a red lace all around and black high heels
Iha when I came out of the closet
Draco was standing in front of the bathroom and he started to sing
I just want to live by Good Charlotte
I was so flattered even though he wasn't supposed to be there
We hugged and kissed
After that we said good night and he reluctantly went back to his room
You know Demwell Snape got the victory secret though
That's not a song
I'm so scared of that
I'm really really
Sorry Eric we're covering your face
The next day I woke up in my coffin
I put on a black many skirt
Many skirt that was all ripped around the end
And a matching top with red skulls all over it
And high heeled boots
Sorry I was making that again
That were black
I put on two pairs of skull earrings and two crosses in my ears
I spring painted my hair with purple
In the great hall I ate some Count Chocula cereal
With blood instead of milk
And a glass of red blood
Suddenly someone bumped into me
All the blood spilled over my top
Faster
I shouted angrily
I regretted saying it
Cause when I looked up
I was looking to the pale white face of a gothic boy
The spiky black hair with red streaks in it
Who could it be
He was wearing so much eyeliner that I was going down to his fate
I was going down his face
And he was wearing black lipstick
He didn't have glasses anymore
And now he was wearing red contact lenses just like Draco's
There was no scar on his forehead anymore
He had manly stubble on his chin
He had sexy English accent
He looked exactly like Joel Madden
He was so sexy that my body went hot
When I saw him kind of like an erection
Only a girl so I didn't get when he was sicko
Alright what's the voice

He grumbled

I exclaimed
Because I love the taste of human blood
Well

He whimpered

We sat down to talk for a while
The dragon came up behind me
And told me he had a surprise for me

Alright chapter 7
Draco and I held our pale white hands
With black nail polish as we went upstairs
I was wearing red satanist sings
Not signs, sings
On my nails in red nail polish
I don't know how you can wear red
Signs on your nails in red nail polish
But then it just like not show up
Emo Shibi? Yeah that's me
Fuck you
Emo
We dark over here
I waved to vampire
Dark misery was in his depressed eyes
I guess he was jealous of me
That I was going out with Draco
Anyway I went upstairs excited with Draco
We went to his room and locked the door
Then we started Frenching passively
And we took off each other's clothes enthusiastically
He felt me up before I took off my top
Then I took off my black leather bra
That doesn't sound comfortable
And he took off his pants
We went to the on the bed
And started making out naked
And then he put his boys thingy in mind
And we had sex
Oh Draco! Draco!
I screamed
Well getting an hour
Ow I just hit my arm
Just getting an orgasm
When all of a sudden I saw a tattoo
I had never seen before in Draco's arm
It was a black heart with an arrow through it
On it and bloody gothic writing were the words
Vampire?
I was so angry
You bastard!
I shouted angrily
Jumping out of the bed
No no you don't understand
Draco pleaded
But I knew too much
No you fucking idiot I shouted
You probably have AIDS anyway
I put on my clothes all huffily
And then stomped out
Draco ran out even though he was naked
Had he had a really big you know what
But I was too mad to care
I stomped out and did so
Until I was in Vampire's classroom
Draco was having a lesion with Professor Snape
And some other people
Vampire Potter you motherfucker
I yelled
Hold on
I'll tell you
When was my immortal

Between 2006 and 2007
Holy crap
You think they'd be careful with anything blood to blood
Because they're off their second blood
They're vampires so I don't even
I don't think they would even apply to them
Ffff

Her real parents are vampires, and one of them is a witch, but Voldemort killed her mother and her father, committed suicide because he was depressed about it.
She still has nightmares about it, she's very haunted and depressed.
It also turns out her real last name is Smith, the knockranger.
Since she has converted to Satanism, she is in slithering now, knockriffin door.
What is it that you desire, you ridiculous dimwit?
Snaped demeaned angrily in his cold voice, but I ignored him.
Vampire, I can't believe you cheated on me with Draco!
I shouted at him. Everyone gasped.
Wait, but she's not dating vampire, so technically, I can't believe Draco cheated on me with you is what she should have said.
This is the least e-real, you would be surprised, just you wait what Snape gets up to.
Oh, it's gonna be a lot like class of 09.
Spoiler alert.
Um...
I don't know why Ebony was so mad at me.
What?
Wait, so...
Why did I... am I...
Oh, is this from Draco's perspective?
No.
Okay, I got sorry, I lost, I kinda lost the plot for a moment. I'm just gonna read it.
I don't know why Ebony was so mad at me.
I had went out with vampire, I'm bi, so as Ebony.
For a while, but then he broke my heart.
He dumped me because he liked Brittany, a stupid preppy fucker.
We were just good friends now, he had gone through horrible problems, and now he was gothic.
Haha, like I would hang out with a prep.
But I'm not going out with Draco anymore.
Says vampire.
Yeah, fucking right, fuck off you bastard.
I screamed.
I ran out of the room and into the forbidden forest where I had lost my rarality.
My rarality, yep, rarality to Draco, and I started to bust into tears.
I'm not under the Draco still not wearing anything.
Yeah, what is this, the Bible?
Haha, this is my Bible.
I was so mad and sad, I couldn't believe Draco for cheating on me.
I began to cry, I cranced the tree when I did it with Draco.
That's pretty hardcore.
I'm trying to actually know exactly which tree that they did, you know what,
where he stuck his, you know what in her, you know what.
Then all of a sudden, an horrible man with red eyes and no nose and everything started flying towards me on a broomstick.
He didn't have a nose, basically Voldemort in the movie.
He was wearing all black but it was obvious he wasn't gothic.
It was Voldemort?
No, I shouted in a scared voice but then Voldemort shouted.
What voice, what voice for Voldemort?
Actually he has, he says vow a lot, so I might just give him a...
I might just give him a birch accent.
Imperius?
And I couldn't run away.
Croc shanks!
I shouted at him, Voldemort fell off of his broom and started to scream.
I felt bad for him even though I'm a sadist, so I stopped.
Abony, he yelled, vow must kill vampire potter.
I thought about vampire in his sexy eyes and his gothic black hair and how his face looks just like Joel Madden.
I remember that Draco had said I didn't understand so I thought,
what if Draco went out with vampire before I went out with him and they broke up?
No, Voldemort!
I shouted back, Voldemort gave me a gun.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Voldemort gave me a gun.
Voldemort gave me a gun.
No, please, I begged.
Thou must heal, if thou dost not, then I shall kill thy beloved Draco.
How did you know?
I asked in a surprised way.
Voldemort got a dude yourself.
Look on his face.
I have a telekinesis.
He answered cruelly.
And if you dost not kill vampire, then thou not know what will happen to Draco.
He shouted.
Then he flew away angrily on his broomstick.
I was so scared, mad, I didn't know what to do.
Suddenly Draco came into the woods.
Draco, I said, hi!
Hi.
He said back, but his face was all sad.
He was wearing white foundation and messy eyeliner.
Kind of like a pentagram, get it?
Between gold, instead of a cross, it's a pentagram.
So like a sort of a cross between, it's a pentagram.
It took me forever to figure that out the first time I ever read this.
Between Joel Madden and Jared Way.
Are you okay?
I asked.
No, he answered.
I'm sorry, I got all mad at you, but I thought you cheated on me.
I expelled.
I hope it's a teagle.
That's okay.
I'm sorry.
That's okay.
He said all depressed.
And we went back to Hogwarts together, making out.
Alright, this is a toxic relationship.
Chapter 10.
It's a lot of making out, yeah.
I was really scared about Vlad and Mort all day.
I was even upset.
Went to rehearsals with my gothic metal band Bloody Gothic Rose 666.
I'm the lead singer of it and I play a guitar.
People say that we sound like a cross between GC, Slipknot and MCR.
The other people in the band are Bloody Mary, Vampire, Draco, Ron.
Although we call him Diabolo now.
He is black hair now with blue streaks in it.
And Hagrid.
This is a loaded band.
Only today Draco and Vampire were depressed.
So they weren't coming and we wrote songs instead.
I knew Draco was probably slitting his wrists.
He wouldn't die because he was a vampire too.
And the only way you can kill a vampire is with a C-R-O-S-S.
There's no way I'm writing that.
Or a steak like the food.
Vampire was probably watching a depressing movie like The Corpse Bride.
I put on a black leather shirt that showed off my boobs in a tiny matching mini skirt that said simple plan on the butt.
You might think I'm a slut, but I'm really not.
Hagrid kind of gives grimmer vibes being in this band.
So he's like the chaperone, he's hanging out.
We were singing in cover of Helena and at the end of the song I suddenly bust into tears.
What voice did I give her?
What voice did I give Bloody Mary?
What voice did I give Hermione?
Oh no, I never gave her a voice.
I also gave her a normal British girl voice.
Ebony, are you okay?
Ebony?
Ebony, are you okay?
Ebony, are you okay?
Bloody Mary asked in a concerted voice.
What the fuck do you think? I asked angrily.
And then I said, well Voldemort came and the fucking bastard told me to fucking kill Harry.
But I don't want to kill him because he's really nice.
And even if he did go with Draco, but if I don't kill Harry, then Voldemort will fucking kill Draco.
I burst into tears.
Suddenly Draco jumped out from behind the wall.
Why didn't you fucking tell me?
He shouted.
How?
How could you fucking poser muggle bitch?
Jesus fuck.
He just called me a slur.
I started to cry and cry.
Draco cried too all sensitive.
Then he ran out crying.
We practiced for it.
See, like, whoa, chill with the M word.
I know, that was, I'm so sorry I said that.
That was, that was a hard M.
That was a hard, I, I feel really awful to say that.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Especially when you add like bitch after it.
Or like really just does it.
Oh yeah, I still have the gun in my hand.
Let me just put that away real quick.
Remember the gun is still on my person.
Practiced for a more hour.
Then suddenly Dumbledore walked in angrily.
His eyes were all fiery and I knew that this time it wasn't because he had a headache.
Cowboy voice, let me think.
What have you done?
He started to cry wisely.
See, that's basically not swearing and this time he was really upset and you will see why.
Ebony.
Draco has been found in his room.
He committed suicide by slitting his wrists.
You guys think I'm gonna get monetized?
Wait hold on, let me check my email.
Clearly I was trying to get monetized.
Yeah, I'm thinking not.
What?
Still says in progress.
Shout out to the person that got me a fidget toy.
You are amazing.
Hold on, I just realized.
Don't have my headphones on to see donuts again.
Let me see if anybody...
Harim, remember to buy your heat suppressors.
Thank you, Anonymous, for that tip.
Thank you for the tip and the other tip.
She's autistic?
Don't worry, don't read ahead.
Don't read ahead.
Stop.
It's still in progress.
I wonder if any of the other girls got monetization yet?
I don't know.
I got out of the bathtub and I put on a black low cut dress with lace all over it sandly.
I put on black heels with pink metal stuff on the ends and six pairs of skull earrings.
I got more piercings, guys.
I couldn't fucking believe it.
Then I looked out the window and screamed.
Snap was spying on me and he was taking a videotape of me and Lupin was masticating to it.
They were sitting on their broomsticks.
Ew, you fucking perv, stop looking at me naked.
Are you paddles or what?
I screamed putting on a black towel with a picture of Marilyn Manson on it.
Suddenly a vampire ran in.
Abracadabra!
He yelled, holy crap.
There was a giant SB that just flew into my window.
He was just eating, he was eating.
He yelled at Snape and Lupin pointing his womb.
I took my gun.
Hold on.
I took my gun.
And I, what did I do?
And I shot Snape and Lupin a gazillion times.
They both started screaming and the camera broke.
Suddenly Dumbledore ran in.
Ebony.
It has been revealed that someone has.
No!
He shouted looking at Snape and Lupin and then he waved his wand and suddenly
Hargrid ran outside on his broom and said everyone we need to talk.
What do you know Hargrid?
You're just a little Hogwarts student.
I don't know who is speaking.
What's had a Cagrin's voice?
I might be a Hogwarts student.
But I'm also a scientist.
This cannot be.
Snape said in a crisp voice.
As blood dripped from his hand where Dumbledore's wand had shot him.
There must be other factors.
There must be other factors.
You don't have any.
I yelled in madly.
Lupin held up the camera.
Try um-fall-element.
Try um-fall-element.
Try um-elephantly.
The lens might be ruined but the tape is still there.
I'm just going to give him normal voice.
Oh wait.
The lens might be ruined but the tape is still there.
A little like a creepy family guy.
Hagrid is Emmy?
No.
He's not going to be cute and funny.
I'm maybe a Hogwarts student.
Hagrid pause angrily.
But I'm also a scientist.
Okay fine.
Fine fine.
Hagrid can be cute and funny.
You want to vote? Okay.
Hagrid voice.
Brixton.
Or cute and funny.
I've got to be homophobic.
My bitch is gay.
Scott?
I actually-
Maybe I'll do Scott to someone else.
Hagrid is Tony.
I may be a Hogwarts student.
But I'm also a Satanist.
Because, because.
I may be a Hogwarts student.
But I'm also a Satanist.
I'm not the cute and funny voice.
Okay.
Cute and funny it is.
Because like they did it.
They always-
When girls wrote fanfics they'd always
tell and not show.
Like because it's like it's like a-
kind of a key factor of
writing as you can
kind of show
what you can do.
Writing as you can
kind of show what they're wearing with how
like the dialogue flows
or like how they interact with their environment.
But when you're younger you just
say it, you just tell.
I was wearing this, this and this instead of like
I looked over at
um, Draco.
My
cross necklace making a distinct
jingling sound.
I can't believe you fucking done this.
I don't know.
I had pretty good fanfics.
Too bad they're like, they were all lost
when they accidentally nuked my computer.
I'm very sad about that.
I like cried for days.
Because then I would 100% read them for you guys.
What was that?
The lens might be ruined
but the tape is still there.
The lens might be ruined
but the tape is still there.
The lens might be ruined
but the tape is still there.
I can do the whistle.
Why are you doing this?
Lupin said angrily while he rubbed his dirty hands
on his cloak.
Hope it's his cloak.
And then I heard the words I had heard before
but not from him.
I did not know whether it feels
shocker and happy or to bite him
and drink his blood cause I felt faint.
Because, because.
Hargid said and he paused
in the air dramatically,
waving his wand in the air.
Then swooped in he and singing
to the tune of a gothic version of a song
by 50 cent.
Because you are gothic.
Snap asked a little afraid voice
because he was a friend.
It meant he was connected with Satan.
Because I love her.
Whoa.
Hargid.
You're like
like 60 years old.
I think he's like actually a student
in this iteration.
Like he's like actually like he's like also a teenager.
Yeah, stop say
okay Hargid is a pedo too.
A lot of American schools like I wanted to address
that issue.
Oh.
Nope, he's an adult in this author's note.
Never mind.
I was about to slit my wrist again
with the silver knife that Drago
had given me in case if anything happened to him.
He had told me to use it valiantly against an enemy
but I knew we must both go together.
No! Sorry, I'm reading ahead.
I thought it was Hargid, but it was Vampire.
He started to scream
Oh my fucking good, no.
My scar hurts.
And then his eyes rolled up.
You could only see his red whites.
I stopped.
How did you know?
I saw it and my scar turned back
into the lightning ball.
No, I ran it closer.
I thought you didn't have a scar anymore.
I shouted.
I do, but the Ebola
changed it into a pentagram for me
and I always covered up with foundation.
I'm losing the goofy voice.
Anyway, my scar hurt
and it turned back into the lightning ball.
Save me!
Wake me up, wake me up inside.
Save me.
Call my name and save me from the dawn.
So this is Class of O9.
This is Gothic Class of O9.
Honestly, I would love to ask the author
of Class of O9 if they got any inspiration
from my immortal.
It's my favorite cover.
I do not know what
Kayoko means.
What does that mean?
Sorry, I still have a gun.
Let me put the gun away.
I don't mean to be threatening you
so diligently with my gun.
I always covered up with foundation,
he said back.
Anyway, my scar hurt back.
Then I had a vision of what was happening to Draco.
Ellipses, ellipses, ellipses.
Wolfamort has him bondage!
Anyway, I was in the school nurse's office
now recovering from my slit wrist.
Snapp and Lupin and Harrid
were there too.
They were going to St. Mango's
after they were recovered
because they were pedophiles.
You can't have those pervs teaching in a school
with a lot of hot girls.
Dumbledore had constipated the city-o camera
and they took of me naked.
I put up my middle finger up at them.
Anyway, Hargard came into my hospital bed.
He came into the bed holding a bouquet of pink roses.
He said it in a very serious voice.
Giving me the roses.
Fuck off, I told him.
You know I fucking hate the color pink anyways.
Although she has a lot of pink stuff so...
I don't like the fucked up.
I don't like fucked up preps like you.
I snapped.
Hargard had been mean to me before for being gothic.
Hargard says.
What? Are they goffs too?
Do you pose their prep?
I asked because I was angry that you bought me pink roses.
I saved your life.
He yelled angrily.
No you didn't. I replied.
You saved me from getting a Paris Hilton pee video
made from your shower scene and being viewed
by Snap and Lupin.
Who masturbated.
Whatever.
Oh, he added. Who masturbated.
To it he added sign Lee.
Whatever. He yelled angrily.
He pointed his wand at the pink roses.
These aren't roses.
He suddenly looked at them with an evil look in his eye
and muttered.
Well, if you want honesty, that's all you had to say.
That's not a spell. It's an MCR song.
I corrected him wisely.
I know. I was just warming up my vocal chords.
And he screamed.
That's not a spell I can't make!
I don't know.
What the fuck is she saying?
What the fuck is Hagrid saying?
And then the roses turned into a huge black flame
floating in the middle of the air.
And it was black.
Did I mention it was black?
No, I knew he wasn't a prep.
Okay, I believe you know what the fuck is Draco.
What the hell is Hagrid's mean spin facts?
I don't know about you.
What a voice, my beloved.
I have found myself okay, you mean old man.
Anyway, when I got better, I went upstairs
and put on black leather mini-dress
that was all ripped on the ends with lace on it.
There was some corset stuff on the front.
Then I put on black fishnets
and black high heeled boots
with pictures of Billy Joel all strong.
I put my hair all out around me
so it looked like Samara from the ring.
Like that girl in the club
in a vampire in the masquerade.
If you don't know who she is, you're a prep, so fuck off!
And I put on a blood red lipstick,
black eyeliner, black lip gloss.
You look kawaii, girl.
What?
Sorry, my head's flying away.
Sorry, you look kawaii.
Not kawaii, kawaii.
You look kawaii, girl.
I can't even do a birth accident for her.
Sorry.
You look kawaii, girl.
Bloody Mary said sadly.
Fangs.
Get it? You did too.
I said sadly too, but I was still upset.
I slipped off my wrist feeling totally depressed
and I sucked out on the blood.
I cried again in my bathroom
and put on the shades on so snap and loop
and couldn't spy on me this time.
I went to some classes.
Vampire was in the hair of magical, magic creatures.
He looked all depressed because Draco disappeared.
He had used to be in love with Draco.
He was sucking some blood from a hufflepuff.
Hoi.
He said in a depressed way.
Hoi back.
I said in an equal wakali said way.
We both looked at each other for some time.
Harry had beautiful red gothic eyes
so much like Draco's
because they were in the same fucking contacts.
Then we jumped at each other
and started screwing each other.
Stop it now, you horny simpletons!
I shouted at Professor McGoggle
who was watching us and so was everyone else.
Vampire you fucker!
I said slapping him.
Stop trying to screw me.
You know I love Draco.
I shouted and ran away angrily.
Just then he started to scream.
Oh my fucking god no!
My scar hurt!
And then his eyes rolled up.
You could only see his red whites.
No!
I ran up closer.
I thought you didn't have a scar anymore.
We already went over this before.
Pace.
Okay. Anyways.
We know that, yep.
The hex is a red white.
I think the whites of the eyes where you can see the veins
I don't get it.
I try to roll my eyes back as if you guys could see.
I try to roll my eyes across the head.
What scar?
Is making me lose IQ?
As it should.
Red Sleras
I highly doubt that's what she wanted to say.
Sleras, Sleras.
Vampire and I ran up the stairs looking for Dumbledore and we were so scared.
We were so scared.
Dumbly door! Dumbly door!
Dumbly door!
We both yelled. Dumbledore came there.
What is it that you want now you despicable snobs?
He asked angrily.
Voldemort has Draco!
We shout at the same time.
He laughed in evil voice.
No, don't. We need to save Draco.
We begged.
No, he said meanly.
I don't give a darn what Voldemort does to Draco.
Not after how much he misbehaved in school, especially with you, Ebony.
He said while he frowned looking at me.
Besides, I ain't never liked him that much anyway.
Then he walked away.
Emperor started crying.
My Draco!
He moaned.
Author's note, don't you think
fake gay guys are like so hot?
It's okay.
I tried to tell him, but that didn't stop him.
He started to cry tears of blood. Then he had a brainstorm.
Like how did I do?
He exclaimed.
What? I asked him.
You don't see.
He said. He took out his wand and did a spell.
Then suddenly, we were in Voldemort's lair.
We ran with our wands out as we heard a crooned voice say.
How were.
How were.
Hela Godavra
insha Allah.
It was Voldemort.
Sorry, Eric. Fuck you.

She's a vampire. She can't die. She just drinks her own blood. I don't understand it. Though...
Can vampires bleed? Well, you know, true blood. I can't remember in the twilight. Can they bleed?
And Obi, I love you, he shouted sadly. I do not care what those fucker-preps and losers think.
You're the most beautiful girl in the world. Before I met you, I wanted to commit suicide all the time.
Now, I just want to fucking be with you. I fucking love you.
Then, he started to sing The Chronicles of Life and Death. We concerted our song now because we fell in love with Joel singing it.
Right in front of the entire class. His singing voice was so amazing and gothic and sexy.
The cross between Gerard, Joel. Oh, she's a cross. She didn't say a pentagram.
Tester, Pierre, and Marilyn Manson.
I'll just note, don't do your fingers, guys. They're so hot. If you don't know who they are, then get the fuck out of here.
This is my last resort. He cut my life into pieces, indeed.
Oh, my fucking god. I said after he was finished. Some fucking prep stared at us.
But I just stuck on my middle fingers that I've recovered in a black nail polish and we're in twine with Draco's now at them.
I love you, I said. And then we started to kiss, just like Hilary Duff. I fucking hate that bitch.
And CMM and a Cinderella story. Oh, yeah, I remember that.
Then we went away holding hands. Lupin shouted at us, but he stopped because everyone was clapping by how sexy we looked together.
Then I saw a poster saying that MCR would have a concert in Hogsmeade right then.
Just teleported and now there's a concert.
We looked at each other all shocked and then we went together.
To be continued.
There's 44 chapters of this. It gets even better.
Handholding. Disgusting.
Anyways, as long as the tip of the iceberg, ladies and gentlemen.
MCR is a wizard band? Of course they are.
What do you guys think? Oh, yeah, sorry, the gun's over.
You love me, right? You like me a lot?
My god, is it finally over?
Yes it is.
Did we already do a part of Sonic High School? I did not read Sonic High School, no?
Because I couldn't remember the name of it.
I couldn't remember that someone suggested a Sonic thing. I can't remember what it was called though.
Excuse me.
I could definitely always do that one again.
Well, not again. I can always read that one.
You loved it? You like the dramatic reading?
Because I'm gothic. Get it?
Thanks. What the fuck am I sitting on?
Ow.
You know, cats will shed their claws a little bit.
I just sat on the claw.
Stabbing my booty.
Cutest dramatic reading. Thank you.
Glad you enjoyed.
Let me know. I'll probably make a poll on Twitter if you guys want me to continue.
When you call him Madam Shibinia Papp.
Wait, hold on. I need that.
Screenshot material.
For all your meme needs.
Hold on. Let me put the gun up higher.
My hand.
Did you like emo goth Shibi? Did you like my immortal?
Because I have a blonde streak and blonde streaks in my hair, you think I'm a fake?
You're a fucking poser, bro. Back off.
Maybe I made a lot more fun.
I dressed like a relay man.
I did actually have a hoodie like this except I had cat ears on the top.
And the cat ears could stretch over like the hood could go over your face.
It was like a cat mask and it came with like a little cat paws.
And it was hot pink and black.
It was great.
You can probably find a picture of it now that I think of it.
The Suprem is nice to...
Well, this is from Booth. I'll probably put credit so that the model in the description.
I'm debating whether or not to end stream or play Call of the Lamb.
I might just end stream because I should probably like do my dishes and shit.
Probably wear Ahigaya clothing if we could.
Well, I did get a face mask that...
You speaking is true.
I fucking hate that dog, man.
So I'm like more loud than I am.
He naps more than me.
This dog is trying to call for Satan to come get him.
Yeah, maybe I'll do a girl later if I'm...
Holy crap.
Guys, that's not my dog. It's a dog outside of my apartment right now.
There's walking by and the dog is screaming.
I don't even know what the fuck he's barking at.
He's just walking with his mom and dad. I think I hear their voices.
It has to be a puppy, although I think there's like a Pomeranian.
And it might be that Pomeranian.
I don't know.
But the dog is annoying because it'll bark at all hours of the day.
Spontaneous interview.
Yeah, it's actually like someone a demon with a reading fanfic.
Yeah, well, is...
Is Emmy streaming today?
Okay, I remember.
Yeah, I see that it finished our ASMR stream.
Strawny is currently playing Skyrim.
So that means you guys wouldn't have anybody till...
Till Azura.
Oh yeah, because she... I remember she was saying she has piano lessons and stuff.
Oh, and Azura is not on.
I know, I realized that when I started streaming that I didn't...
I didn't post it on YouTube.
Again, I suck at doing YouTube stuff.
Okay, so do you get...
I guess I'll keep streaming then because then it's just...
It's just mercy.
At 11.
It'll be a large gap of, you know, cute girls.
So I'll be glad to fill that gap.
Fill that gap.
I guess I'll play a little bit of Call of the Lamb.
Fill the what?
The what?
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna end stream, but then start it again.
It's just I'm gonna start a separate stream.
Actually, I'm just gonna set up that right now while I'm talking to you guys.
It's one animal I think you can throw hands with.
None of them, because I would never harm an animal.
I'm gonna start a separate stream.
It's one animal I think you can throw hands with.
None of them, because I would never harm an animal.
I'm gonna stay in my dull hand form.
Where?
Yeah, I'll just call it a lamb.
Yeah, I'm saving the vlog.
Don't you worry.
Don't you worry.
You're a pretty little head.
I'm gonna end stream, then I'm just gonna start again.
And just so people can be like,
wait, there was van-fiction reading,
and then they're like, just so it's not confusing.
And Estrani did that for her 2.0
and the exposing be a little other thing.
And I've done that in the past myself.
Schedule stream.
Schedule stream.
Onput.
607.
Call order name.
Can I put poop in my thumbnail?
Guys, stop pooping everywhere for the love of God.
Is that allowed?
Not my thumbnail.
My cult of the emo.
She'll be watching my course.
I'm gonna stream call the lamb as Shibony.
It's fine.
It's fine.
Gorilla cult of the lamb.
Let's try to beat the third boss.
Oh my God.
Sometimes graphics artist gives me the thumbnails,
but they're like the wrong size
and I don't have to keep compressing them.
I'm actually gonna edit that real quick.
All right, I'll be right back.
I'll see you guys.
Probably I'll say 6.15.
Bye.
Give me one second.
Public 6.15.
Cool.
Public 6.15.
All right, later nerds.
Somebody fucking hung up.
Public 6.15.
