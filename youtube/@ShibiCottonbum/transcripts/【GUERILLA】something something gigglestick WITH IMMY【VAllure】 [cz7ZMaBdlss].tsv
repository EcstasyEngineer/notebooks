0	8000	Work. OBS. Sometimes it just ends after I started. I love it when it does that. Okay, I didn't do it though.
8000	11000	Yippee!
11000	16000	Maybe you mute myself so I don't hear myself.
16000	19000	Oh my god.
19000	22000	Yeah.
22000	27000	Because you are so fucking small.
28000	37000	You are on us. Okay, if we're legit with how tall you are and how tall I am.
37000	49000	So I am like this. My legs are so fucking long, bro. And then there's you. You'd be like down here.
49000	53000	You'd be like that.
53000	58000	Wasn't you? Yeah, you a shawty.
65000	72000	Oh, you're so small. I can just move you around. Yeah, she's like my little doll. Oh wow, she's like my little...
72000	77000	Oh, you're muted? Oh, you are muted.
77000	82000	You attached me. You attached me to you.
83000	85000	Get me off!
85000	91000	Oh, you're so cute. It's like I'm holding onto you like a little puppet.
91000	95000	Set me free. Let me go.
95000	100000	My cute little sister and me.
100000	104000	Okay, I'll make you bigger.
104000	107000	Oh my god.
107000	110000	Thank you. Perfect.
110000	117000	A happy family. I can't even see my chat. That's why I didn't know you were muted. Hold on.
117000	126000	Oh my god. So how's everybody doing?
126000	133000	Hope everyone's doing well. Yeah, I'm getting ads on my own video.
133000	136000	Wait, really? Yeah.
136000	143000	I should have just not monetized it. She's a little brats. The immuppet. Oh my god, Emmy Muppet.
143000	147000	No, oh my god, people are gonna fuck the immuppet.
147000	150000	Toma's already working on a Muppet for you.
150000	152000	Oh, now I gotta use it.
152000	158000	She just was doing it for fun for our designs, but she's like, yeah, I just want to make one based off of Muppets.
158000	163000	She's making you, she's basing you off of the rat.
164000	169000	And I'm like, she'll love that.
169000	174000	Um, but yeah, me and...
174000	177000	G-U-E-R-I-L-L-A.
177000	181000	Did I add an extra L? Okay, no, I didn't.
181000	189000	So you probably saw the silliness that took place. It looks like we're about to do an apology video.
189000	194000	We're sorry for getting Strawny's channel a-straked.
198000	202000	We're sorry for cooking you by having sex with each other.
202000	205000	In discord.
205000	208000	We will never do such a thing again.
208000	211000	Oh, really?
211000	219000	Um, no, but we were just hanging out after our collab earlier and me and Emmy had been cooking up something for you guys.
219000	223000	And so then we wanted to make a joke.
223000	229000	Then I was going through my scripts because I realized I could record scripts at the same time as being in a discord call.
229000	232000	So I'm like, ah, maybe Emmy can give me some pointers or whatever.
232000	234000	Am I moaning? Well, you can tell me.
234000	240000	And I'm reading the scripts and I'm like, wait, what the fuck is off the entirety of October?
240000	243000	Like, what is this? I can't.
243000	248000	And so I'm just posting screenshots and glimpses of the script.
248000	251000	And so I sent it to Emmy.
251000	257000	Um, and I don't know what we're going to do with it.
257000	259000	You want to act it out together?
259000	264000	I think that'd be cool if we just pick the worst one, you think?
264000	265000	Okay, okay.
265000	271000	Because I know for a fact that Strani's not going to have me do the scripts now.
271000	277000	You actually have the names of your scriptwriters. I never have names online.
277000	286000	The last one I don't have names on the scriptwriter and if I figured out who it was, I would fight them.
286000	292000	Because my scripts literally before October are fine.
292000	296000	Okay, okay.
296000	300000	Most of them are not that bad.
300000	302000	In October?
302000	305000	Yeah, I think it's just that one.
305000	309000	That one? I'm trying to find it. I don't know what that could just do with it.
309000	314000	I'm reading the other ones and they're not that bad. It's just that one.
314000	316000	Was that number two?
316000	322000	Um, it's number one.
322000	325000	Oh no, you didn't look at number two then.
325000	327000	What's wrong with number two?
327000	333000	Uh, face-mashing and slurping in a better mood, good snogging.
333000	335000	I'll make you forget all about her.
335000	339000	Here on Clash Rock, remember these?
340000	344000	The most mouth-watering tits you've ever put in your mouth. Play with those.
344000	346000	What the fuck are you reading?
346000	349000	I'm reading! I'm reading the second one.
349000	352000	I think it's like a third paragraph down.
352000	355000	Tummy Gurgle. Oh, look who's hungry now.
355000	360000	Sorry funnel cake is gone and the truck usually leaves by now.
360000	364000	I'm only teasing. I know this is a bit backwards, but how about there?
364000	366000	That's not that bad.
366000	368000	It's not, it's really...
368000	371000	Here, let's start, let's start around the...
371000	374000	She glurps his giggle stick against her face so much.
374000	376000	Where is, I can't add up to it.
376000	380000	Hold on, let me, let me control find giggle stick.
386000	389000	It's up medium.
389000	395000	I have like 101 things that contain giggle in my entire master's group.
396000	400000	Is the giggle stick two words? Okay, it is. I found it.
400000	407000	Okay, do you want to, do you want, I'll do the voice acting part and then you can read the direction?
407000	409000	Sure, sure, sure.
409000	412000	Okay, okay. So I'm going to start at enough.
417000	419000	Enough.
419000	424000	So if you go a couple sentences up, it's at the beginning of the paragraph.
424000	427000	Enough. She forces herself up.
427000	429000	Oh, I found it, I found it.
429000	431000	Okay, ready?
431000	433000	Take a sip of the water.
433000	436000	You guys are getting glorps on you.
439000	443000	Okay, you guys are getting insider information.
443000	446000	Although I know for a fact the script is not going to be used, but...
448000	450000	Enough.
450000	456000	She forces herself up and splurts his gock from her pummeled vagine.
456000	461000	You didn't have that bad a day to where I'm just going to let you forget your manners. Sit.
461000	465000	The toilet squeaks in resistance to both of their weight.
465000	470000	You're way too cocky for a man risking his entire livelihood in a public restroom.
470000	473000	And you forget that this rabbit...
473000	477000	She glorps his giggle stick against her fasal nut.
477000	478000	Is mine.
478000	481000	She begins sliding down and riding.
481000	484000	Aha, now who look who's whimpering like a bitch?
484000	486000	That's right, bitch.
486000	487000	Ha.
487000	490000	Domineering Humpery.
490000	492000	You ain't nothing but a bitch to me.
492000	495000	And y'all know, bitches ain't shit to me.
498000	500000	Fucking take it.
500000	501000	Ha.
501000	505000	If I were caught in make national headlines,
505000	509000	a bitch like you would probably be a single HR email.
509000	511000	Look at that pathetic fucking face.
513000	515000	He comes.
515000	517000	Huh? You came?
519000	520000	So...
520000	521000	Plop.
521000	522000	What?
522000	524000	Plopping intensifies.
524000	526000	I still need mine, bitch.
526000	528000	You selfish motherfucker.
528000	530000	You think you're better than me?
530000	532000	You think you're hot shit?
532000	535000	You think now that you've got a bit of cash?
535000	537000	You can have any girl you want.
537000	538000	Look at you.
538000	542000	You can't even have a girl show up to date you.
542000	546000	And you think you can come before me?
546000	547000	Ha ha.
547000	548000	I bet.
548000	550000	Door opens.
550000	551000	Get the fuck out.
551000	554000	Do the slams, cops!
554000	555000	Ha.
555000	556000	You're nothing.
556000	557000	Nothing.
557000	558000	You're fuck.
558000	559000	Fuck.
559000	563000	She whimpers into a shuttering orgasm.
563000	564000	Ha.
564000	565000	Oh.
565000	566000	You came again?
566000	567000	Ha.
567000	568000	Oh.
568000	569000	Ha.
569000	570000	Oh.
570000	571000	Wind down.
575000	576000	Like, wait.
576000	577000	Did he leave?
577000	578000	Like the door shut.
578000	579000	I don't...
579000	582000	No, someone walked in while they were doing it.
582000	584000	And then left.
584000	586000	That's what it was.
590000	592000	I'm dead.
592000	593000	Okay.
593000	595000	Ha.
595000	597000	That was amazing.
597000	598000	Ha.
598000	599000	Ha.
599000	602000	She takes some toilet paper to wipe the mess.
602000	603000	Here.
603000	605000	Let me clean you off.
605000	606000	Slurp.
606000	607000	Pop.
607000	608000	Ah.
608000	609000	You all right?
609000	611000	She begins dressing herself.
611000	614000	I kind of mashed you down into the toilet there.
614000	615000	Here.
615000	616000	Give me your hand.
616000	618000	She helps him up.
618000	620000	Up you go.
620000	621000	Oh.
621000	622000	Careful.
622000	623000	That's what it says.
623000	624000	Can't feel your legs.
624000	625000	Come on.
625000	626000	Lean on me.
626000	628000	Door opens.
628000	631000	Uh, or excuse us.
631000	633000	Time skip.
633000	634000	Okay.
634000	635000	Slowly.
635000	638000	Slowly on the bench.
638000	640000	They sit.
640000	641000	Oh.
641000	642000	I'll be right back.
642000	643000	She leaves.
643000	645000	Returns a bit later.
645000	646000	Here.
646000	647000	Some water.
647000	648000	Hold.
648000	649000	So nice.
649000	650000	I know.
650000	651000	It's looking nice.
651000	652000	Huh?
652000	654000	Oh, I just have sensitive teeth.
654000	655000	So, oh yeah.
655000	656000	They both drink?
656000	659000	How about the same cup?
659000	664000	I mean, they just, they just fucked in the bathroom.
664000	666000	So whatever.
666000	672000	Listen, I, uh, I'm sorry for what I said back there.
672000	673000	I know.
673000	674000	I know.
674000	681000	I know you're already having a shitty day and, uh, really?
681000	682000	Huh?
682000	685000	So you like that kind of talk, huh?
685000	689000	I guess with my line of work, I can pick up the kind of person who likes being talked
689000	690000	down to.
690000	692000	Tell me, Gurgle.
692000	699000	Oh, look who's hungry now.
699000	700000	Sorry.
700000	702000	Funnel cake is gone.
702000	706000	The truck usually leaves by now.
706000	708000	I'm only teasing.
708000	711000	I know this is a bit backwards, but how about dinner?
711000	712000	My treat.
712000	713000	Can you stand?
713000	714000	No rush.
714000	715000	All right.
715000	716000	Come on.
716000	717000	I know a place.
717000	718000	It's not far.
718000	719000	Wow.
719000	720000	How romantic.
720000	723000	Oh, look at that.
723000	730000	The bathroom and then went to, to a park bench.
730000	731000	I don't know.
731000	732000	No, I'm not.
732000	735000	We're not even reading fanfics, guys.
735000	737000	This is a script.
737000	739000	We're reading Shibi's scripts.
739000	743000	This is my, that was a script that was handed to me.
743000	752000	And thank you for that.
752000	757000	Do you want to read the first one?
757000	758000	Yeah, we can do it.
758000	761000	Oh, I think, I think the first one's a little bit.
761000	762000	This has to be an audio.
762000	763000	Come on.
763000	766000	You guys want that to be an audio?
766000	767000	All right.
767000	768000	That's the first one.
768000	771000	Oh, this one's ridiculous.
771000	774000	Is it all the pants and part?
774000	775000	Yeah.
775000	777000	My cat's trying to hop up on my lap.
777000	778000	Not now, Fia.
778000	779000	We're busy.
779000	780000	Okay.
780000	782000	We're fucking busy, Fia.
782000	784000	You can start.
784000	785000	Okay.
786000	788000	Beeping key card lock.
788000	789000	Unlock door.
789000	790000	Heels approaching.
790000	791000	Long night.
791000	794000	I startled you, didn't I?
794000	798000	I would have knocked, but I own the place.
798000	799000	I'm sorry.
799000	801000	She doesn't burp.
801000	803000	Your hotel room.
803000	805000	Your hotel room.
805000	806000	No, you're right.
806000	808000	This is a misunderstanding.
808000	811000	Just not the one you think it is.
811000	812000	Here.
812000	813000	Sit.
813000	815000	She pats the bed.
815000	818000	You're the one who is with that rowdy crowd at the bar, right?
818000	821000	The one's cheering like a Super Bowl riot.
821000	824000	She clicks her tongue shamingly.
824000	828000	No social awareness whatsoever.
828000	829000	Look at you.
829000	830000	Apologizing.
830000	831000	You're not in trouble.
831000	833000	Not yet, anyway.
833000	834000	Here.
834000	836000	Compliments of the hotel.
836000	839000	She pops a bottle, pours two drinks.
839000	843000	Actually, I would have celebrated with you all then and there if I wasn't paraded around
843000	847000	by my usual ass kissers and yes men.
847000	850000	So, what are we celebrating?
850000	851000	A promotion?
851000	853000	Oh, cheers to that.
853000	855000	She swirls her icing soups.
855000	856000	This is not bad.
856000	858000	Yeah, this one's not that bad, actually.
861000	863000	I don't know if you can hear the...
863000	867000	You probably can't hear the, um, the donos.
867000	870000	But someone said, thank you for the $2 tip.
870000	875000	Damn, I need a cold shower to calm my giggle stick after that slurping scenario.
875000	877000	Crick the fuck up.
877000	879000	Calm your giggle stick.
879000	882000	Oh, you can't hear them?
882000	884000	That's fine.
884000	885000	This was just lily a girl.
885000	888000	Guys, you don't have to donate for this.
888000	890000	Um, okay.
890000	892000	Let me see where was it.
892000	894000	Oh, you sounded...
894000	895000	What?
895000	897000	Go ahead, sorry, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.
897000	900000	Hmm, you all sounded like you were having so much fun.
900000	902000	So, why did you leave early?
902000	903000	Tired?
903000	904000	Tired of what?
904000	907000	Huh, you know, I always like that phrase,
907000	909000	drain social battery.
909000	913000	It's a way more polite and succinct than fed up with everyone's bullshit.
913000	915000	Straight to the point, you know.
915000	918000	She takes one more sip and sets her drink down.
918000	920000	Ooh, which is how I like it.
920000	922000	Hmm, how I like everything, really.
922000	924000	Which brings me to you.
924000	927000	Even as the obvious quiet one of your group of friends,
927000	931000	you made it so hard not to notice you in that zoo of a booth.
931000	932000	A cutie.
932000	934000	She steps forward.
934000	935000	Like.
935000	936000	She steps forward.
936000	937000	You.
937000	940000	She kisses the viewer.
940000	942000	Making out.
942000	945000	What's this here?
945000	948000	She rubs his erect stick through his pants.
948000	952000	That doesn't feel like the stick of a man who's tired.
952000	956000	In fact, it feels more of a stick that needs to be drained.
956000	958000	So how about it?
958000	960000	Shall we get to the point?
960000	962000	Good boy.
962000	966000	She nibbles at his neck kissing while she unbuckles his pants.
966000	968000	Disrose.
968000	971000	Here, let me slide these off.
971000	973000	Now, on the bed.
973000	975000	Good boy.
975000	978000	She crawls into the bed kissing and rubbing at his hips.
978000	981000	What is rubbing at his hips mean?
982000	984000	And now these.
984000	986000	Rubbing those hip bones.
986000	989000	She slides his tiny lighties off.
992000	994000	His tiny lighties off.
994000	997000	I didn't catch that one when I read it before.
1003000	1006000	It's always the quiet ones with the biggest sticks.
1006000	1008000	Why is that?
1008000	1011000	Rubbing a man with absolutely nothing to compensate for.
1011000	1014000	Glock suckering.
1014000	1016000	Feel nice.
1016000	1018000	Of course it does.
1018000	1023000	Slippery slobbering until she stops mid popsicle slurp.
1023000	1026000	Hey, do not touch the ears.
1030000	1032000	Good boy.
1032000	1035000	She continues into throating.
1035000	1039000	I think now that we should really get the celebration started.
1039000	1042000	What do you say, big shot?
1042000	1044000	That's what I like to hear.
1044000	1046000	Light teasing.
1046000	1048000	She slinks out of her ponzu.
1050000	1053000	Bring that dick here, boy.
1058000	1063000	She starts to grind on the tip before lightly slapping him.
1063000	1066000	Ah, ah, ah, don't get greedy now.
1066000	1067000	What's wrong?
1067000	1070000	Don't like my cat kissing the top of your stick?
1070000	1072000	Aw, but you're celebrating.
1072000	1074000	There's no need to rush this, baby.
1074000	1077000	We can party all night if you're able.
1077000	1080000	Just allow me to savor this a bit slowly.
1080000	1082000	Slowly on the tip.
1082000	1087000	She laughs as she swirls her hips just the bellend half inside.
1087000	1088000	And that's what it says.
1088000	1090000	It says bellend, everyone.
1090000	1094000	My big, heavy hips need to savor the shape of the tip.
1094000	1095000	Aw.
1095000	1101000	She slides her kitty down the top of his popsicle.
1101000	1105000	Glides so smoothly against the top of your popsicle.
1105000	1107000	Look at you.
1107000	1109000	We're supposed to be celebrating, weren't we?
1109000	1114000	I shouldn't be having all the fun, but I'm not fully sure you want this.
1114000	1118000	Say, if you had to choose between your new promotion and losing that position in exchange
1118000	1120000	for sliding the full length of your cat.
1120000	1125000	I mean, your dog all the way to the base inside of my tight, gripping cat.
1125000	1127000	What would you say right now?
1127000	1128000	Hmm?
1128000	1129000	Oh, I can't hear you.
1129000	1130000	Please?
1130000	1132000	Please, what?
1132000	1134000	That's please, madam.
1134000	1135000	Louder, boy.
1135000	1137000	Ah, good boy.
1137000	1139000	Now we can celebrate.
1139000	1141000	Segs, slow and heavy.
1141000	1143000	And it said with two G's.
1143000	1145000	With two G's, it says.
1145000	1147000	Hmm, almost.
1147000	1155000	She be laughs, releasing desperate exiles as she restrains herself to slowly descend down.
1155000	1160000	The popsicle in capital letters.
1160000	1162000	The Triton.
1162000	1164000	The Triton.
1164000	1168000	Yeah, the Triton's filling me so good.
1168000	1170000	Here, put your hands here.
1170000	1172000	Now, little man.
1172000	1174000	A nasty laughter.
1174000	1177000	You're going to want to hold on.
1177000	1184000	Heavy slapping, no pants dance, followed by animal grunting.
1184000	1188000	Yeah, all the way in.
1188000	1191000	Wetness increases.
1191000	1193000	Making your way up in the world.
1193000	1197000	Still yet, ungh, fucking beneath me.
1197000	1204000	No matter how hard you work, you'll always be nothing but a popsicle to do.
1204000	1206000	You want that, don't you?
1206000	1209000	That's yes, mistress.
1209000	1213000	Segs pauses.
1213000	1214000	Wait, wait, wait.
1214000	1216000	I need this bra off.
1216000	1226000	She releases her fat tiddage free from the burdens of a bra as she catches her breath.
1226000	1229000	Now.
1229000	1232000	Oh fuck, sex medium pace.
1232000	1237000	Have you ever seen a more perfect pair of fucking tits?
1237000	1240000	Oh, don't even answer that because you haven't.
1240000	1243000	And now, I want them in your mouth.
1243000	1245000	Sex reasons.
1245000	1247000	Ah, that's it.
1247000	1249000	Ah, that's...
1249000	1253000	Monkey noises.
1253000	1255000	Wait, this does monkey noises?
1255000	1262000	It says monkey noises.
1262000	1268000	Go on, make the monkey noises.
1268000	1270000	Ah, another one.
1270000	1274000	Ah, fit bath for those fat fuckers in your mouth.
1274000	1277000	Yes, yes.
1277000	1280000	Sex fast paced.
1280000	1284000	More, I want more.
1284000	1288000	Her pace becomes rapid and animalistic.
1288000	1290000	You small time bitch.
1290000	1292000	Fuck me, you're fucking nobody.
1292000	1294000	Are you coming?
1294000	1295000	Coming?
1295000	1297000	Are you coming?
1297000	1299000	Fuck.
1299000	1304000	He fills sheebie to the brim with a nasty load of pent-up gunk.
1304000	1307000	Fuck.
1307000	1315000	Wind down, catching her breath.
1315000	1320000	Nothing like a little fireworks to cap off a party.
1320000	1324000	She slips from her drink.
1324000	1326000	Oh, goodness.
1326000	1328000	Look at all that flowing out.
1328000	1331000	I can tell you're a workaholic with no time to let loose.
1331000	1334000	Just look how much you let loose in me.
1334000	1338000	She laughs and then kisses him.
1338000	1340000	Look at that.
1340000	1342000	Such a content little smile.
1342000	1345000	Not that forced uncomfortable smile around your friends from the bar,
1345000	1347000	but a real one.
1347000	1348000	It's beautiful.
1348000	1350000	Oh, me.
1350000	1352000	You're too sweet.
1352000	1354000	I don't want anyone folk in my life,
1354000	1357000	but you, I can tell you're different.
1357000	1359000	Awkward pause.
1359000	1363000	Oh, um, that's stuff about you being a nobody.
1363000	1366000	I, um, I was just dirty talk.
1366000	1367000	I didn't mean that.
1367000	1368000	Any of it.
1368000	1370000	Everything good.
1370000	1373000	That's um, that's good.
1373000	1375000	Even more awkward pause.
1375000	1380000	Oh, um, I forgot that I had more work to do tonight.
1380000	1383000	She begins putting her clothes back on.
1383000	1387000	Oh, um, uh, keep the bottle top shelf stuff.
1387000	1389000	Or so they tell me.
1389000	1392000	I just told the bartender to give me something impressive and stiff.
1392000	1394000	Sounds like you.
1394000	1397000	Laughter trails off.
1397000	1400000	So, um, see ya.
1400000	1402000	Door closes.
1402000	1405000	Why was the ending so fucking unsexy?
1405000	1407000	Oh, come on.
1407000	1409000	That was it.
1409000	1412000	That was the first group.
1412000	1415000	The deku accent.
1415000	1418000	I literally, I have tears running down my face.
1418000	1420000	I know me too.
1420000	1423000	Oh, ooh, ooh.
1423000	1425000	Oh, tidy whitey.
1425000	1427000	Tidy whitey.
1427000	1430000	Oh, my God.
1430000	1434000	I just had to share this with you guys.
1434000	1437640	I know, I just tried to do a loser at the end.
1437640	1441480	Thank you for this super LP, 4145.
1441480	1444000	If this becomes an audio, I will seriously consider
1444000	1446680	something to my Patreon.
1446680	1447780	Oh my God.
1447780	1450200	No, guys, there's literally a full month of October
1450200	1454840	like this, the fucking monkey noises.
1454840	1457240	I'm like, do they hate me?
1457240	1460240	Why did they even write monkey noises?
1464840	1468160	Oh my God.
1470560	1473680	Whoever wrote those scripts cooked with gas.
1473680	1476920	Thank you, feel their love for this super.
1476920	1477760	All right.
1479840	1482720	Aside from the mildly racist undertones,
1482720	1484680	this is pretty funny.
1484680	1487600	Oh my God, I didn't even think about that.
1487600	1489440	I didn't notice.
1490560	1493440	Oh, you see, the sweet precious child.
1493440	1495960	I love you so much, Emmy.
1495960	1499920	When you said monkey, I just thought it related
1499920	1501800	to like animalistic, you know?
1501800	1504120	Yeah, the animalistic monkey noises.
1504120	1507800	Yeah, but he did write you a little stupidly.
1507800	1509000	Yeah.
1509000	1512160	No, so if you guys are new coming in,
1512160	1515120	I was in call with Emmy and we were working
1515120	1518120	on an audio together for something else
1518120	1521120	that she will probably finish up at some point.
1521120	1522520	And I can't wait for you guys to hear that.
1522560	1523680	We're very excited.
1523680	1527080	But I was like, oh, since I figured out
1527080	1529120	I can record during a call,
1529120	1531240	let me look at my stuff right now
1531240	1533000	and we can just like hang out and I can record
1533000	1534360	and you can like make fun of me, whatever.
1534360	1537920	So I'm looking at my October scripts.
1537920	1539080	I haven't recorded September yet.
1539080	1540480	I was looking at October because I was like,
1540480	1541640	oh yeah, what are my scripts again?
1541640	1544080	I didn't read it that far ahead.
1544080	1547400	And I'm just like, I'm like, what is this?
1547400	1550280	And I'm like sending screenshots in our discord
1550320	1551400	with the other girls.
1551400	1554080	And I'm like, Strani, Strani, please.
1554080	1554920	What is it?
1554920	1555760	What is this?
1555760	1558680	And I'm like, what are these?
1558680	1560440	What are these?
1560440	1562480	Oh, I'm like, she definitely, I'm like,
1562480	1566080	Strani probably had faith in the script writer
1566080	1567920	or that somebody was trolling
1567920	1571200	and just fucking just did something.
1571200	1572040	Or I don't know.
1572040	1575440	Maybe someone got hold of the link for my scripts.
1575440	1576280	I don't know.
1577320	1578720	So who knows?
1578720	1581600	I think it's genuinely the script writer.
1581600	1582440	I want to just note,
1582440	1585320	because my script writers usually write off
1585320	1588000	what they've written and this person did it.
1588000	1589440	And I feel like they did that on purpose.
1589440	1591520	They were ashamed, they were ashamed.
1591520	1592340	It's great though.
1592340	1594740	So that was, that's the first script for,
1595720	1597320	it's called Entanglements.
1597320	1598440	It's a Shelby or Shibi.
1598440	1599920	And it's supposed to be, that was,
1599920	1602320	it's a four for the entire month.
1602320	1603320	It's just a continuation.
1603320	1604200	It's a story.
1606120	1608200	You know what I think we should do, Amy?
1609560	1612840	I think we should do the other scripts.
1613800	1615040	You want to spoil them?
1615040	1616040	At a later time.
1616040	1618240	I'll ask Strani if we could do,
1618240	1620960	I think she'll be fine if we did this one.
1620960	1624880	But I think if we did that as like a little Mimi joke,
1626920	1631920	or if I record them seriously with you narrating the activity,
1632520	1635220	I think that would be absolutely peak.
1636060	1637620	It would.
1637620	1638460	Yeah.
1638460	1639860	And we can just like upload both to our,
1639860	1641180	both of our Patreons.
1642380	1643620	That would be funny.
1643620	1646460	I don't think any of the other girls had stuff like this.
1646460	1647940	I think it was just me.
1648940	1651020	Yeah, I don't have anything like that,
1651020	1652100	but I haven't like,
1652100	1654940	they haven't written up to October for me.
1654940	1655780	Yeah.
1655780	1656620	So that's why.
1656620	1657460	Yeah.
1657460	1659380	So I don't know if like the script writers,
1659380	1663020	but it's good because it's good that I fucking noticed it
1663020	1665300	because I would hate for the girls to get other stuff.
1665300	1668620	And like, like I see who I know,
1668620	1670740	Strani was saying who's ESL might not like,
1670740	1672300	quite understands like, okay,
1672300	1673900	I guess I just read this then.
1675100	1677860	And think that it's like sounds okay when it doesn't.
1680020	1681940	Honestly though, I think I see would have noticed
1681940	1684020	and been like, what is this?
1684020	1684860	Yeah.
1684860	1688180	I don't think I see would just like read out like,
1688180	1689020	yeah.
1689020	1689860	Lucky noises.
1693500	1696900	Oh, this is, this would be funny for April Fool's as well.
1696900	1700100	Just do like a meme-y, like really meme-y,
1700100	1702700	lewd audios for, oh my God.
1702700	1703700	I'm asking Strani about that.
1703700	1704860	I think that's a good idea.
1704860	1705700	Yeah.
1705700	1706540	It's Tracy and Daddy ESL.
1706540	1707380	Yeah.
1707380	1708220	I don't think, yeah.
1708220	1709740	Yeah, you're right, you're right.
1709740	1710580	Kickles.
1713060	1714740	Oh my God.
1714740	1717700	But I hope we didn't stress Strani out too much.
1718540	1723860	I mean, she was gonna find out sooner or later.
1723860	1726540	It'd be funny if I like center the audio.
1726540	1728020	I should, I imagine if I didn't say anything
1728020	1730660	and I just recorded it, it just said it to her.
1730660	1733100	I don't think she listens to our audio,
1733100	1735180	so I think it would have passed.
1737540	1739820	I think you're the only one who got scripts like this
1739820	1740940	because you're the only one to view a letter
1740940	1743220	that can turn a sex script into a joke
1743220	1745140	with my impersonations.
1745140	1746580	It's beat comedy.
1746580	1750020	Thank you for this, I like that.
1750020	1751540	That's good.
1751540	1752820	Give that a little heart.
1754420	1755740	It's for myself.
1757100	1758060	That's so great.
1758060	1759060	I guess Strani was more,
1759060	1760300	way more stressed by her card game.
1760300	1763220	Yeah, I saw she was, she was sweating a little bit.
1763220	1764460	Oh my God.
1765340	1768380	But thanks for stopping by Emmy.
1768380	1769220	I just asked,
1769220	1771380	because I know Emmy has some stuff to get done.
1771380	1775060	So thank you for spending time with me real briefly.
1775060	1776460	Thanks for having me.
1779020	1781140	I love you, Emmy.
1781140	1782380	I love you too.
1782380	1783820	Have fun, what are you doing next?
1783820	1785980	I don't know, I'm probably just gonna yap.
1785980	1787300	Okay, have fun yapping.
1787300	1789340	Yeah, I'm something, I don't know.
1789340	1790420	I'll see you later.
1790420	1791740	Bye, Harold.
1792580	1793420	And the pin pals.
1793420	1794740	We got some pin pals in the chat.
1794740	1797060	Pin pals, goodbye, goodbye.
1797060	1797900	See you later.
1797900	1799220	Bye, bye, bye.
1805900	1809500	Wait, I forget that I have to like, quit the collab.
1809500	1812180	She's like, stop it.
1812180	1813420	She's like, doing stuff.
1815420	1817540	All right, I'm sorry, little sister gone.
1823740	1824580	Okay.
1826380	1828060	I'm like so far behind in my own bond.
1828060	1829580	I'm like, what the fuck?
1829580	1831860	Oh, I'm not leaving it.
1831860	1833340	I'll probably like stay on for a little bit,
1833340	1835660	but like, yeah, I just had to share that with you guys.
1835660	1837220	I love Emmy so much.
1837220	1838060	We've been in call.
1838060	1840460	We were in call together for a little bit,
1840460	1843780	and then Mercy had some stuff to do too.
1843780	1847660	Cause it was literally like me, I see Mercy and Emmy
1847660	1849820	and Strani for a little bit, just hanging out.
1849820	1851340	And Strani had a stream.
1851340	1854060	I see how to go to bed to pour a little polar bear.
1854060	1855700	And Azura was streaming,
1855700	1858820	and then Mercy had to go take care of some stuff.
1858820	1860740	So, but that was, it was,
1860740	1864020	so yeah, me and, me and Emmy were just like chatting.
1864020	1864980	And I'm just like, you know,
1864980	1867460	cause she has a lot more experience with me
1867460	1870300	than me with like audios and stuff.
1870300	1871980	So I was just like grabbing pointers from her.
1871980	1873300	And she's like, you're doing really good.
1873300	1874140	I'm like, yeah.
1874140	1876540	And then I'm like, let me look at my audios.
1876540	1878920	And let me look at my script.
1880180	1885180	And I was like, wait a second, something's not right.
1885940	1888180	Something's not right.
1889180	1890900	This is the most feeler.
1890900	1892220	I was really funny.
1892220	1893380	It was really funny.
1894260	1895100	It was really fun.
1896420	1899140	Yeah, so the whole month of October is like that.
1902540	1904860	November and December are still on the writing stage.
1904860	1909140	I haven't started recording September yet,
1909140	1911380	but I was gonna record September
1911380	1914080	after the, I got off Call of Emmy,
1914940	1917040	but then I got distracted with this.
1918940	1923940	But yeah, cause I think October was supposed to be the month
1924340	1926400	where I was like the Dommie month,
1926400	1928500	but like, I'll be honest with you.
1930220	1931380	There's just, you can just like,
1931380	1934520	some of my first scripts were written by like Strani.
1934520	1936340	And you could tell like a woman wrote them
1936340	1937960	versus like a man writing this,
1937960	1939620	although this is definitely very meme-y.
1939620	1941660	So I don't know if like they were taking it serious.
1941660	1942500	I don't know.
1942500	1945620	But then I have like one of our other script writers,
1945620	1947740	Etwa, and they have good scripts too.
1947740	1951580	So I'm like, they wrote very similarly to Strani.
1951580	1953900	So I'm like, okay, maybe, I don't know.
1953900	1955620	Maybe they just like never written before.
1955620	1957060	I don't know what happened.
1959500	1960420	I also didn't tweet.
1960420	1961260	I'm sorry.
1961260	1963020	I didn't like tweet to say I was live or anything.
1963020	1965060	I was just like, I'm here.
1965060	1966180	So I apologize.
1966180	1968020	Cause I was just like, okay, we need to tell the people this
1968020	1971380	and give them an explanation as to what we were doing in Call.
1971380	1973380	Although we immediately prepared ourselves
1973380	1975140	and we heard Strani's like, we're gonna hop and call.
1975140	1977060	And we were like, okay, start moaning.
1977100	1978020	Start doing stuff.
1980020	1982980	But I hope that gets clipped cause it would be so funny.
1982980	1985060	Um, yeah.
1985060	1986980	It was literally, but it's not even chat, GPT,
1986980	1989380	chat, GPT would not write something like that.
1990740	1992660	Chat, GPT would never write something like that.
1992660	1993500	I don't think.
1995340	1996780	But it was, yeah, it was so bad.
1996780	1997620	It was great.
1998900	2000580	I can imagine the script writer must have felt bad
2000580	2001740	about writing a lot of script
2001740	2003700	and so I had some meme humor in the parentheses
2003700	2006180	since narration isn't meant to be read out loud.
2006180	2011100	Yes, but even like, even with the dialogue
2011100	2015460	in the later scripts, it's not good.
2015460	2016940	And that was just the first script.
2016940	2019220	It gets progressively worse.
2020300	2022980	And we have more than one script writer.
2024180	2029180	So it's not like one person is writing 30 scripts a month.
2032340	2035100	It's like there's multiple people writing us scripts.
2036780	2038420	And then Strani will also like chime in
2038420	2039980	every once in a while as well.
2042180	2043300	As a lead translator myself,
2043300	2044900	these scripts were not something I never considered
2044900	2046220	except it will work for me.
2046220	2047940	Kind of, exactly.
2047940	2052940	It's like when I, one, they're doing a lot of like direction
2053340	2054980	and then like when I, I don't know,
2054980	2058820	maybe it's because like one of our other script writers
2058820	2061580	and Strani just writes differently when they give me scripts,
2061580	2065420	but they do a lot of like direction and what's going on.
2065420	2067900	They're doing a lot of saying and not,
2067900	2069500	or they're doing a lot of showing and not saying,
2069500	2071900	which is not what you do for an actual script.
2073380	2075380	At some point you should hold script writing competitions
2075380	2077100	and pick the best four for each month.
2077100	2078700	Oh, that'd be pretty cool.
2078700	2081180	For like maybe like a special month, we do that.
2081180	2082220	That'd be really nice.
2082220	2083300	That's a good idea.
2083300	2084700	Bring out with Strani.
2084700	2085540	She be a bridge.
2085540	2088140	That's literally, this is the month of October,
2088140	2089140	she be a bridge.
2092260	2094380	Big shout out to Smoothie for a good evening.
2094380	2096340	Big shout out to Smoothie for their viewer debut.
2096340	2098340	Oh, a hundred percent, yes.
2098340	2099500	Thank you so much to Smoothie
2099500	2102300	for doing a debut compilation of us.
2102300	2104300	I was like, holy crap, this is awesome.
2104300	2105140	It was so good.
2105140	2105980	I was laughing.
2105980	2107820	I'm like, I was so embarrassed.
2107820	2110340	The first opening line for the video
2110340	2112660	is welcome to be sucky fucky.
2112660	2113860	Well, where did you fucky?
2113860	2115540	You're sucking whatever the fuck I said.
2115540	2116500	I was like, oh my God.
2116500	2119020	Yeah, mommy's scripts are very, very good.
2119020	2120300	And I've also learned a lot
2120300	2122020	since I've started doing scripts,
2122020	2124060	like what you guys like, what you guys don't like
2124060	2125300	and like how you want me to read things.
2125300	2127260	I've also fixed my 3DO.
2128180	2133180	So it's, yeah, please watch Smoothie's video.
2133660	2136060	It was really, really funny
2137380	2138980	how he edited us all together.
2143140	2147980	But yeah, so, and I'm probably gonna hold
2147980	2151140	some sort of like script writing stream when I come back
2151140	2154300	because, and I've mentioned doing this before,
2154300	2156860	before I read the script, but I'm like, okay,
2156860	2158340	if this is the script that gets submitted,
2158340	2160140	I know I can write better than this.
2161860	2164620	Because like for example,
2166340	2169500	it's like everything's like, when like Shrani writes,
2169500	2171900	it's like everything's guided and like by word of mouth
2171900	2176500	and it's very, it's very like seductive and alluring.
2176500	2178860	And it's like, she's through the dialogue,
2178860	2180620	she's telling you what's happening.
2180700	2183900	But this person was mostly just writing direction
2183900	2185540	and it was very odd.
2186340	2188420	I'm like, we're not acting it out,
2188420	2190420	but I'm so sorry to the script writer if you're watching,
2190420	2193020	but that was very silly.
2195740	2199060	There were some very, very good things in there.
2200660	2202380	Hi, hi, hi.
2202380	2205620	But yeah, I wanted to like hop on and show you guys that,
2205620	2207620	but I can't wait for you guys to listen to the audio
2207620	2209420	that me and Amy just did together.
2209420	2210460	It was really nice.
2210460	2211900	You guys don't like it.
2213300	2217020	But yeah, it's inspired by a certain someone
2218020	2221860	who did a similar script in the past
2221860	2223500	that a lot of people enjoyed.
2223500	2225900	And so we wanted to do one ourselves.
2227340	2229380	Script writer, you cooked, but it was the wrong menu.
2229380	2232220	Honestly, facts, like the script is awesome,
2232220	2233300	but it's awesomely bad.
2233300	2235060	But it's like, you know, like it's like,
2235060	2237060	I'm trying to say this as nice as way possible.
2238020	2240020	Yeah, a certain someone.
2242140	2243460	Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.
2243460	2244980	Hello, hello.
2244980	2247660	Where is the audio gonna be uploaded?
2247660	2250500	I think she's uploading it to Twitter.
2250500	2252660	I think part one, there's two parts,
2252660	2255340	part one, I think will be on mine
2255340	2257100	and I think part two will be on mine,
2257100	2258660	either one, we each have a part.
2261140	2262460	Amy's a good script writer.
2262460	2263980	She's also a very good actress
2263980	2268220	because we were in call together, working out the script.
2268220	2272700	And so I had to sit there and listen to her, do her lines,
2272700	2274940	and I'm trying so hard not to laugh.
2278380	2282320	Yeah, it'll be a Twitter audio, I'm pretty sure.
2283780	2285720	Just so everybody can see it.
2285720	2287160	Yeah, it's a short thing.
2287160	2289260	It's not like 10 minutes long.
2289260	2292500	It's literally like two minutes, if not shorter than that.
2292500	2293680	Her audio with IC was base.
2293680	2296240	I heard it was, I heard it was really good.
2296240	2298640	You're gonna piss myself laughing.
2298640	2299480	I lost it, yeah.
2299480	2303480	Dude, I was literally losing it in the call with Emmy.
2303480	2305000	I'm like, Emmy, please look at this.
2305000	2307040	Please tell me I'm not going crazy.
2307040	2308960	And then I posted it and I was like, manager,
2308960	2309920	is this your fault?
2309920	2312040	And they were just like, why am I catching strays?
2312040	2313520	No.
2313520	2315440	And I'm like, I'm telling Strani.
2315440	2317320	And I'm like, Strani, please, please.
2317320	2320000	That's when I hopped around like Emmy, let's hop in the call.
2320000	2323000	And she's like, oh my God, but we were cackling so hard.
2323880	2327960	But now I know what you guys get for Emmy's audios.
2328880	2331480	She gave me a little taste and I'm like, okay.
2332480	2333560	All right, all right.
2333560	2336400	Oh my gosh, I can see.
2336400	2339280	Like, damn, my little sister's so talented.
2340520	2344120	And I'm like, how do I sound like that?
2344120	2345960	Like teach me your ways.
2345960	2346920	She does spoil you.
2346920	2348560	I was like, damn.
2348560	2351360	I was gripping my mouse, listening to her like, excuse me.
2352360	2354720	I want to be just like Emmy.
2357480	2359360	But it was, yeah, it was really fun to record.
2359360	2361800	And then now that I know that we both know
2361800	2364440	that we can record stuff in calls with each other,
2364440	2365880	we definitely want to get the other girls
2365880	2367360	to record stuff with us in calls
2367360	2369640	because it would just be so funny.
2369640	2372240	And then we can also give each other like tips and stuff.
2373360	2376840	And then like, yeah, I think it would just be great.
2377760	2380400	Nilsis, Emmy, Big Sis, Gibi, exactly.
2381240	2382840	But yeah, I'm sure, like the pin pals
2382840	2384360	are definitely gonna like it.
2384360	2386240	Harem is definitely gonna like it.
2387560	2390520	But yeah, the wholesome bonding, 100%.
2390520	2393720	Yeah, I like, I love spending time every time.
2393720	2395560	One of the girls left the call
2395560	2397280	when we were like all like kind of trickling off
2397280	2399160	to do our stuff that we had to get done,
2399160	2401360	whether it be like audios, scripts or whatever.
2401360	2402840	Smacked my hand on the table.
2402840	2404320	I'm like, like I see left.
2404320	2406040	I was like, I love that bear.
2406800	2407640	And Mercy left.
2407640	2409200	I'm like, I love that yandere.
2410960	2411840	Amy left.
2411840	2413880	I didn't say anything, but you guys know that I love her.
2413880	2415680	I love that little pumpkin girl,
2415680	2417360	that little hex maniac.
2417360	2418520	Anyone idea what's gonna drop?
2418520	2419360	Oh, I don't know.
2419360	2420920	Emmy has a lot of projects going on right now.
2420920	2423440	She's cooking up a bunch of stuff for you pin pals.
2423440	2428440	So just wait, don't worry.
2428880	2430960	But we both recorded it in like 10 minutes.
2430960	2433760	So it's really, she has to edit and stuff.
2433760	2434600	I asked her if she needed help.
2434600	2435720	She says, she's like, oh, I'm just gonna edit.
2435720	2436800	I'm like, okay.
2436800	2438560	I kind of want to teach her to teach me how to edit
2438560	2440400	and as well as Strani to teach me how to edit that stuff.
2440400	2444280	Cause usually I just like send it off to the audio editor
2444280	2446960	and then like insert all the like sound effects
2446960	2447800	and all that stuff.
2447800	2449360	It would be cool to like learn how to do that.
2451240	2454080	But yeah, it was, it was really fun and it was funny.
2454080	2455800	Like I would be using like my mommy voice.
2455800	2460400	I'd be like, come on little girl and be like, hey.
2460400	2462880	And she was like, it was really funny.
2462880	2465560	And then when she was making like her portion
2465560	2466760	that I'm not going to spoil.
2466760	2469360	I was like screaming internally.
2469360	2470640	So I hope you guys like it.
2471680	2472520	But yeah.
2473480	2476480	I hope you guys liked also the title of my stream,
2479480	2481240	something simple, something giggle stick.
2481240	2482200	I need to sneeze.
2486040	2486880	Thank you.
2487960	2489480	But yeah, it's really small and short,
2489480	2490800	but I think you guys will like it.
2490800	2492600	So short, sweet to the point.
2495560	2496640	Thank you, thank you.
2499000	2502920	But yeah, it means converting she be into someone.
2504440	2506720	I think honestly, I think, yeah.
2506720	2509880	I think I'm definitely being, I'm getting Emmy Pilled.
2511080	2513440	Can my allergies have been acting up like for the past few days?
2513440	2515240	I've been like sniffing a whole bunch.
2519040	2521240	But yeah, I hope you guys shibbling.
2522240	2526080	Don't get me started on the cotton bum family.
2526080	2528080	I literally just did that off the rip, by the way.
2528080	2532480	I don't even, I was possessed by some incestuous devil
2532480	2534320	to just do all that random ass lore.
2534320	2536520	I'm so sorry for some of you.
2536520	2538800	I thought it was funny as hell.
2538800	2540120	Based on yesterday's stream,
2540120	2542600	I think Emmy fully converted you already 100%.
2543880	2545520	Bro, imagine she being Emmy playing Kauffman,
2545520	2546360	Andy and Lillie.
2546360	2547200	That would be so funny.
2547200	2549280	If we did a collab stream playing Kauffman,
2549360	2550440	Andy and Lillie.
2552760	2557000	And like I voiced Andy and she voices Ashley.
2557000	2559080	I think that would be really, really funny
2559080	2561080	before building that day was wild it was.
2561080	2564560	But I just wanted to like do something kind of silly
2564560	2566120	and kind of like ridiculous.
2566120	2570360	Well, you guys literally watched me farm for four hours.
2570360	2573120	Honestly, I don't even remember farming.
2573120	2574720	I don't even, I generally don't even remember
2574720	2575560	what I was doing.
2575560	2578080	I just like shot a bird for four hours.
2578080	2579800	I got four million runes.
2580640	2583760	And yeah, and I just wanted you guys to laugh a bunch.
2585360	2586760	Don't lie, you've been playing this lore
2586760	2587840	since before your debut.
2587840	2589520	No, I usually actually was like never really
2589520	2590880	into that sort of stuff.
2590880	2592320	But like I get the allure.
2592320	2595320	Ha ha, ha ha, the V allure.
2595320	2596400	So I'm like, you know what?
2596400	2598480	Let me do a little treat for like the harem
2598480	2599760	cause usually you don't get that from me.
2599760	2600720	Let me do that.
2600720	2603680	And you guys know like I love being cute and funny sometimes.
2604960	2607040	Like it kind of like, I can like,
2607040	2608760	I feel like I show a different side of myself
2608760	2611680	when I get to be like shebethany and be cute and funny.
2611680	2614040	And then when I'm sheby, I can be like, you know,
2614040	2616040	my more like mommy adult self.
2616040	2618760	Oh, and you know, it's very, it's always fun.
2618760	2620040	I like, cause I, you guys know,
2620040	2621800	I used to be cute and funny on the daily.
2621800	2623680	So I'm at my PL.
2623680	2626680	So it's, I kind of miss that sometimes.
2626680	2629680	But I also just love being a big powerful woman
2629680	2631080	with drill hair.
2631080	2632680	Yeah.
2632680	2633920	I think you're always cute and funny.
2633920	2635520	Oh, thank you, so sweet.
2637280	2641320	But yeah, I think I'm, I mean, I see they've got me.
2641320	2644080	I'm like, oh man, I miss like that sort of stuff.
2644080	2645840	I miss being a princess.
2645840	2647040	And then Mercy makes me be like,
2647040	2648840	oh, I miss being kind of yandere.
2648840	2650760	But what I like about all of us is like,
2650760	2654400	we don't feel like we all can like do each other's niches.
2654400	2656120	Like, you know, like sometimes it means Dom,
2656120	2658760	sometimes Mercy's Dom, sometimes it means yandere.
2658760	2661800	Sometimes I see is like a little bit yandere.
2661800	2664080	Sometimes Azura is more Dom.
2664080	2666400	Like I remember Azura like said some like crazy stuff
2666400	2668680	on my stream that was like very Dommy
2668680	2671040	when during our collab stream with Emmy and Mercy.
2671040	2673480	And I was like, excuse me.
2673480	2674720	Sorry, I'm talking so fast, by the way.
2674720	2676200	I think I had caffeine.
2676200	2678360	So I'm like, I also feel really bad
2678360	2682200	because I feel like I talked a lot during the,
2682200	2683040	let me slow down.
2684560	2686160	Deep breath, sheepie.
2686160	2689920	I feel like I talked a lot during the collab.
2689920	2693680	So I'm sorry if I like talked over your Oshii
2693800	2695400	or what, then I'm sorry.
2695400	2697080	Don't hurt me.
2697080	2697920	Yep, God.
2697920	2698760	Kicking in.
2698760	2699600	Someone that will allow you,
2699600	2700440	so it's not a human.
2700440	2701280	I don't know guys, it's a human.
2701280	2702120	I'm super human as well.
2702120	2704800	I'm gonna get in, I'm gonna get in.
2704800	2707920	All I see is the beginning of multiple personality disorder.
2707920	2709560	It's gonna be great.
2710440	2711720	Oh my God.
2711720	2714440	Bunspeak, no, Bunspeak would be when I get a pyre.
2714440	2715640	When I get a pyre, when I get like this,
2715640	2718040	when I get Bunspeak, that's Bunspeak.
2718040	2721000	That's when I get a mulliness and I sound really cute.
2721000	2723560	What's next, loving girlfriend, Sheebie?
2723560	2726760	You kind of already gotten that the past couple days.
2726760	2728480	Oh my God, Eminem's a YouTuber now.
2728480	2730240	Rap got Sheebie in the house, yeah.
2732600	2735840	But yeah, you just carry the conversation.
2735840	2737080	Yeah, sometimes I like,
2737080	2740000	sometimes I have to tell myself if there's a silence,
2740000	2741600	like I can be comfortable in the silence.
2741600	2744000	Sometimes I feel like I need to fill a silence.
2745560	2747120	Sheebie popping off today.
2747120	2750800	I'm full of, I'm full of all the jokes, you know.
2750800	2752640	Are you happy you're at 8K subscribers?
2752640	2754440	Yes, it was such a pleasant surprise
2754440	2755760	that I noticed that this morning,
2755760	2757560	because only like yesterday or the day before,
2757560	2761760	I was at 7.7, so that the clip,
2761760	2765440	the debut stuff probably helped a lot in the collab stuff.
2765440	2768200	So I'm glad that you guys like me and enjoy me.
2768200	2773200	Like I said, and one of my goals was to get 10K subs,
2773240	2774960	and I'm literally almost close to that,
2774960	2777320	and it's surreal to me.
2777320	2780320	Younger me would be confused, but proud
2780320	2782560	of how I got 10K subs,
2782560	2785480	because I've always wanted to be, you know,
2785480	2787560	a YouTuber and stuff or a streamer,
2787560	2790240	and my dreams are coming true.
2790240	2792720	And I get to be a whore, like it's great.
2793800	2796040	Affectionate, you know.
2797320	2798640	But yeah, it'll be super cool.
2798640	2801000	I'm trying to think of what to do for 10K.
2801000	2804200	I think I was, I'm probably gonna do
2804200	2806400	another hand cam for 10K.
2808080	2812280	I was, or maybe like a hand cam ASMR,
2812480	2813680	but that'd be cool.
2813680	2815880	You guys can see the stupid shit that I do.
2817600	2819640	But yeah, I prefer to give me ideas for 10K
2819640	2822400	because I would love to celebrate that milestone with you,
2822400	2826120	but I'm so very, very, very thankful for all of you.
2826120	2828240	8K is a really big number to me,
2829320	2830240	and I just can't wait.
2830240	2831280	And it's funny, because like,
2831280	2832600	Strawny's like, just you wait,
2832600	2836400	just until you wait until I get you that 100K play button.
2836400	2838640	And I'm like, oh, don't say that.
2838640	2841960	Like, oh my God, like that just seems so surreal to me.
2841960	2844600	And like, you're doing great, Shabrowski.
2846160	2848040	You got to be a woe.
2848040	2849000	What's a woe?
2849960	2850800	Lovingly?
2850800	2851640	Oh, a woe.
2851640	2852480	Oh, I got you, me.
2853600	2855240	Very funny.
2855240	2857320	But yeah, and I'm proud of the other girls too.
2857320	2859880	Like, I think Strawny is about to hit 10K
2859880	2861160	or probably has hit 10K.
2861160	2864360	I noticed it when me and Emmy were watching her stream
2864360	2868600	and giggling like a bunch of maniacs that I was like,
2868600	2869560	oh, she's at 9.9.
2869560	2871560	So like, Strawny's about to hit 10K.
2871560	2873640	Emmy is past 10K.
2873640	2875800	Icy finally hit 10K, 6K.
2875800	2878400	And I'm like, we're all growing at a steady pace.
2878400	2880840	And I'm so proud of all of us in the hard work
2880840	2882120	that we're all putting in.
2882120	2883360	It really shows.
2884240	2886520	And then again, the algorithm works in mysterious ways.
2886520	2890640	So sometimes like, one of us lag behind,
2890640	2892040	but we like make sure we lift each other up
2892040	2895640	because like, I'll say it like, Corpo Unity,
2895640	2896720	like we are unified.
2896720	2898640	Like we want to support everyone.
2898640	2900520	Strawny at 9.9, 4K.
2900520	2902000	Oh, see, like very close.
2902000	2906240	Like she'll probably hit 10K by the end of the night
2906240	2907800	or like tomorrow.
2907800	2909080	So I'm just really happy.
2909080	2911320	I'm happy that Strawny's dream is coming true.
2911320	2916320	She's giving us a platform to lift up smaller creators up.
2918080	2920080	They usually wouldn't have certain opportunities
2920080	2922440	and they're happening and it's great.
2922440	2924520	Like she was telling us about other opportunities
2924520	2925880	we might be able to have in the future.
2925880	2928200	And I literally was like, what?
2928200	2930240	Like we could have that.
2930240	2931560	We could get this.
2931560	2933880	Like, are you kidding me right now?
2933880	2935120	Like what?
2936280	2938640	Yeah, I'm so thankful for the girls.
2938640	2940400	I'm so thankful for them.
2940400	2941360	They're so wonderful.
2941360	2945960	I was literally in college before everybody left.
2945960	2948920	And I was like, can I just say, I love you all.
2948920	2951440	And Mercy's just like, I love you too.
2951440	2954320	And one, Mercy's a very lovey person.
2954320	2955160	Oh my gosh.
2955800	2957360	I walked away to use the bathroom,
2957360	2959080	but I still had my headphones on.
2959080	2961600	And it was, and then I think like Amy and Strawny
2961600	2964360	also like stepped away to like get tea and stuff and water.
2965360	2970040	And I'm like just like sitting on the toilet
2970040	2972920	using the bathroom with my headphones on.
2972920	2976080	And I just hear Mercy talking to Icy.
2976080	2979240	And she's just like, hi, Icy.
2979240	2982240	And Icy's like, hi.
2982440	2986120	And then she's just like, I love you, Icy.
2986120	2989000	And Icy's like, I love you too.
2989000	2991840	And I'm just like laughing on the toilet
2991840	2993880	because they're so fucking cute guys.
2993880	2995280	I swear to God.
2997360	3000520	But yes, like we all very much love each other.
3000520	3002560	We're all very supportive of each other.
3002560	3003400	And it's really cool.
3003400	3005440	Like I was, I liked talking, cause I was talking to Amy.
3005440	3006440	I'm like, oh, what'd you got going on?
3006440	3008200	Like what do you want to, like projects you want to do?
3008200	3010200	She was telling me and I'm like, aw, sick.
3010800	3012840	And I love the opportunity.
3012840	3017000	Like I always look forward to all of our collabs and stuff
3017000	3020960	because I just, we're usually busy with our own like streams
3020960	3022000	or like working on stuff.
3022000	3025480	So it kind of stinks when we can't like sit
3025480	3026880	and talk with each other.
3026880	3027720	And I was kind of bummed
3027720	3029800	cause like I know Azura had to stream afterwards.
3029800	3032400	And I was like, I wanted to hang out with Azura too.
3032400	3034160	I miss Azura.
3034160	3036160	I miss Azura.
3036160	3038320	I'm going to hang out with her
3038320	3040320	and have her just make funny noises on call.
3040320	3041240	Cause that's what she does.
3041240	3043600	She just giggles and cackles and just goes,
3043600	3045600	she's like, a little maniacal.
3045600	3046600	I love her for that.
3048200	3051480	Yeah, we got to hang out a lot, lots today.
3051480	3052600	And it was really awesome.
3052600	3054440	It was really great.
3054440	3055280	I can't wait.
3055280	3056120	We get to hang out.
3056120	3059360	Well, technically we don't get to hang out tomorrow, sad.
3059360	3062240	Cause we have the watch along, but like,
3062240	3064360	I kind of want to like be in call with them.
3064360	3066440	I'm going to ask actually, can we all be in call together
3066440	3067280	and we do the watch alongs
3067280	3069280	and I'll react at the same time.
3069280	3071280	I think we are going to do that.
3071280	3072200	I don't know.
3072200	3073880	At last, cause that would be great.
3075040	3076760	I'm still in call.
3076760	3077600	Whoops.
3079880	3082480	Let me just, I forgot I was still in call.
3082480	3084880	Any one of them could have walked in and been like, hey.
3086160	3087000	Oh.
3090440	3092000	Yeah, we're already like trying to make plans
3092000	3093600	to like see each other and stuff.
3095280	3096120	A monthly Jen collab.
3096120	3096960	Yeah.
3096960	3097800	We try for, we aim for that.
3097800	3101000	We try to aim for a month and then we might do
3101000	3102280	of like all of us.
3102280	3104400	And then like sometimes like, like me and Mercy
3104400	3106080	just like kind of just like jumped in call together.
3106080	3108880	Like we had a collab with other girls from mythos,
3108880	3110600	but then we kind of hung out with each other.
3110600	3112920	And then I did the same thing with Amy today.
3112920	3114960	And like, I want to do that with Icy.
3114960	3115800	And I want to do that.
3115800	3118320	And I've done, I want to do that with Azura and Strani.
3118320	3119920	Like I haven't even gotten into a collab with Strani yet.
3119920	3121720	Like what the hell?
3121720	3125400	But we all like definitely, like I'll just like wake up
3125400	3127480	and look at our Discord chat.
3127480	3129640	And yeah, Mercy collab's happening next week.
3129640	3130480	Yes, yes, yes.
3130480	3131680	We're playing Super Bunny Man.
3133040	3138040	I look at my, the Discord general for our company.
3138920	3139840	And it's just a bunch of us.
3139840	3141120	We're all just like, I love you.
3141120	3141960	I miss you.
3141960	3142800	We're gonna hang out.
3142800	3143640	I miss you guys.
3143640	3144600	What are you guys doing today?
3144600	3145440	What's going on?
3145440	3146920	Oh, that's really tasty food you posted.
3146920	3147760	Oh my God.
3147760	3148600	Your cat's so cute.
3148600	3150040	Like it's, it's great.
3150040	3151480	We need the viewer house to be real.
3151480	3152960	Imagine that would be so fun.
3152960	3154600	Oh my God.
3154600	3155360	Yeah.
3155360	3159800	It's just like, it's really nice to be a part of something.
3159800	3161920	And I didn't realize how much I wanted that.
3161920	3166920	Cause like I went into a company wanting to grow as a creator.
3168680	3170640	And I know, like I work well with others,
3170640	3174760	but I didn't know I would be so devoted and dedicated
3174760	3176520	to all the other girls.
3176520	3179680	I was just like, okay, am I gonna see them as coworkers?
3179680	3181240	And I'm like, no, I don't see them as coworkers.
3181240	3183080	I see them as very close friends.
3183520	3186600	Um, I know I'm bad when it comes to watching streams
3186600	3187440	of all kinds of everyone,
3187440	3188880	but generally I hope you all continue to grow and be happy.
3188880	3190080	I think we will.
3190080	3191200	And it's like, it's okay.
3191200	3193760	You don't have to like, you do what you can.
3193760	3195520	And we appreciate that.
3195520	3197320	We appreciate all of that.
3197320	3199600	How much do we need to donate to get the viewer house
3199600	3200440	to become real?
3200440	3202840	I think it would be way too much.
3202840	3206120	Viewer house turned into a battlefield by the pets.
3206120	3207080	Yeah, that's a good point.
3207080	3208000	We all have pets.
3208000	3209280	That'd be bad.
3209280	3211600	My cats would probably eat in these rats.
3213760	3214600	How are you doing?
3214600	3216280	I'm glad I can see my favorite bunny waifu.
3216280	3218000	Oh, thank you.
3218000	3219360	Hello, I'm doing really great.
3219360	3220840	I got to hang out with cute girls today
3220840	3222720	and I got to look at really awesome designs.
3222720	3225240	I really wish we could have done more.
3225240	3227840	Yeah, it does feel great to feel like you belong somewhere.
3227840	3231560	I've never like felt more meant to do something,
3231560	3232680	to be honest with you.
3232680	3235600	Like I am like, I am supposed to be here.
3235600	3237480	I belong here.
3237480	3241200	And like, I remember like hoping to the freaking universe
3241200	3245240	I got into Veealer and because I'm like,
3245240	3247640	I know I'm meant to be here.
3247640	3249680	And that's why I recorded my audition video
3249680	3251760	three days before auditions opened.
3251760	3253880	And I thought of all the possible questions
3253880	3255560	they may ask in the form so I could prepare
3255560	3257480	and send it in as fast as possible.
3257480	3259040	And that's why I was the first one
3259040	3261080	to submit my audition to the Veealer.
3264080	3266280	Veealer at her, so I need soundproofing in every room.
3266280	3267440	You're so right though.
3267440	3269880	Like all of us fucking just moaning.
3269880	3271120	Hi, she being fellow harem.
3271120	3272400	Hello.
3272400	3274080	I do really hope you all get many,
3274080	3275560	many years of streaming and growing.
3275560	3276400	Me too.
3276400	3277840	Like I am only thinking like,
3277840	3279960	this is only like the second month guys.
3279960	3281640	Like we're halfway through the second month
3281640	3286240	and I can't believe how much has happened and changed.
3286240	3288360	And it's all thanks to you guys.
3288360	3290160	Like what the heck?
3290160	3291240	My God.
3291240	3295160	But do you also belong to the October series?
3295160	3296000	No.
3298000	3298840	Oh.
3300360	3302120	Hi, hi, everybody coming in.
3302120	3304400	I was never into VTubers much
3304400	3306120	until I saw all of your debuts last month.
3306120	3307640	But now I'm glad I came and stayed.
3307640	3309800	I've had more laughs recently than I had in a while.
3309800	3312560	I'm so glad that all we want to do is make you laugh
3312560	3313400	and coom.
3314280	3316280	I love you and all of you are giggle sticks.
3316280	3317560	I think if I ever,
3317560	3319720	I think I'm gonna call it that from now on.
3321600	3324360	No, wait, no, but I really like the idea of Bible.
3324360	3327440	But giggle sticks is funny too.
3327440	3329640	I just think it's so funny.
3330120	3330960	That that happened.
3330960	3332640	Hold on, let me see.
3332640	3333480	Oopsies.
3333480	3335400	I didn't mean to go into the freaking,
3336600	3338200	I didn't mean to join another call.
3340920	3345040	Oh, my manager sent me my thumbnails for the month
3345040	3346400	and I'm like awkward
3346400	3349840	because we're doing a Twilight watch along next week.
3349840	3354040	And it's funny because it's just like me as like Bella
3354040	3355880	next to day, next to Edward.
3355880	3359880	Oh, so funny.
3361720	3363520	Well, as Vod say, oh, the Vod staying up.
3363520	3365800	I was kind of like talking to Emmy
3365800	3367400	and Emmy was kind of explaining to me
3367400	3369560	how like Vod limited stuff works
3369560	3370720	and she was kind of like showing me.
3370720	3372760	And I'm like, it's not,
3372760	3375960	as long as I don't get a strike, I think it's fine.
3375960	3377880	So I'm like, you know what, it's funny.
3377880	3379280	It's hilarious.
3379280	3380360	I'm leaving it up.
3382160	3383720	I'm glad you found something that was meant for you.
3383720	3384680	I know what I'm after.
3384680	3385720	There's some obstacles in between.
3385720	3387160	And for that, I hope to find something that clicks
3387160	3388240	like you did with the other.
3388240	3390440	Yeah, like it took some effort to get here.
3390440	3393480	Like I had to stream, I had to prove my worth.
3393480	3397400	You don't like, some companies will say like,
3397400	3399480	oh, you don't need any prior streaming service,
3399480	3402080	like experience, but you really do.
3402080	3404960	And so it is really recommended.
3404960	3406920	If you want to become a VTuber
3406920	3408760	and you want to join a company,
3408760	3410080	please stream for a little bit
3410080	3412600	because you might find out you don't like it
3412600	3414280	or it might not fit into your schedule
3414320	3415520	or it's not the type of lifestyle.
3415520	3419360	You might not be used to the hate or the positivity.
3419360	3422920	Like, you know, oh, thank you, Paul for the 10 gifted.
3422920	3423760	Thank you.
3423760	3424600	What the heck?
3426120	3429200	My gosh, I'll forgive the Bible.
3429200	3430520	The script master should release a new
3430520	3431920	English translation of the Bible.
3431920	3433000	I agree with that.
3433000	3433840	Thank you so much.
3433840	3434880	You're so sweet.
3434880	3436240	Team Edward or Team Jacob?
3436240	3438040	Team Jacob.
3440080	3441080	Team Jacob.
3442080	3445280	Celebratory pod keeping gifts.
3448040	3450360	Oh, mad I'm putting in that work in a show.
3450360	3451320	It deserves success.
3451320	3452160	Thank you.
3452160	3453000	Thank you.
3453000	3455960	And I'm happy you guys are enjoying the work that I put in.
3455960	3458160	Should be the trolley deserve better into, oh, 100%.
3458160	3459240	Trolley deserve way better.
3459240	3460760	Are you kidding me?
3460760	3462640	I would hate my child if my child was, you know,
3462640	3464160	whatever that happened.
3464160	3465640	All that jazz.
3466840	3468840	What's a giggle stick?
3468840	3471960	I want you to look down in between your legs.
3473960	3476000	Um, and yet I guess, oh no.
3476000	3479360	We got touched again, bro.
3479360	3483960	Oh, we all know why Team Jacob don't look at me like that.
3484800	3487160	Shibi, can I ask the reason for why we can't give
3487160	3488680	the full memberships to the girls
3488680	3490520	and instead only the emotes here?
3492440	3493640	I, to be honest with you, again,
3493640	3495960	I'm not super familiar with YouTube,
3495960	3500960	but I think the idea is that only really dedicated people
3505200	3508920	will want to spend time with you in the membership streams
3508920	3510880	and they're the ones who watch all your streams
3510880	3511800	and know what you're about.
3511800	3514760	If kind of like anybody went into a membership stream
3514760	3516400	and they're kind of like, I don't know, like normie,
3516400	3518280	then they might like kind of be off put,
3518280	3520760	but like for example, like my tag stream,
3520760	3524360	a lot of people were thrown off by that.
3524360	3527440	And oh my God, no, it is still got missed, bro.
3529080	3530480	Thank you for the other.
3530480	3532200	Oh my God, what?
3533120	3537000	Thank you for the other 20 and another 20 by 30 to you, Paul.
3537000	3538840	Oh my God.
3538840	3541320	All right, here are my little PogChamp.
3543240	3544200	Shibi likes furries.
3544200	3545040	No, I don't.
3547080	3548720	Damn.
3548720	3552320	But I think, yeah, it basically makes it
3552320	3554760	so you do have to spend at least some money to attend.
3554760	3556040	Gifts still give you a nice discount.
3556040	3558920	Yeah, like you just pay the remainder.
3560720	3561960	But yeah.
3561960	3563800	Oh my God, why are you guys so nice today?
3563800	3568800	Thank you for the 10 gifts, what the hell, guys?
3568840	3572320	Oh, they're like really trying to help that bro out.
3572320	3574080	I want to see, did he get it?
3574080	3575360	Oh my God, he did it!
3579080	3582080	Bro, your settings must be off.
3582080	3584560	There can be no way.
3584560	3586920	There can be no way, you must have settings off
3586920	3589240	so you can't get this gifted.
3592360	3593200	Dodged.
3594400	3595480	Just a running gag.
3595480	3598800	There's always one person that just misses it.
3598800	3599640	Where's mine?
3599640	3601320	You have one, it's right there.
3605720	3606920	Oh, you guys are so nice.
3606920	3609400	You're like, let's get all green in here.
3609400	3610240	Or is a brand account?
3610240	3612520	That's a good point, it could be a brand account.
3613520	3616280	She be punishing me lovingly, thank you.
3616280	3619920	Punch the mic, punch the mic, punch the mic, punch the mic.
3619920	3621920	I think that's gonna be a bit now.
3621920	3622760	Sorry.
3624280	3625960	See, I'm punishing you lovingly.
3625960	3628160	That's loving, me punching you.
3628160	3630520	One day it'll work, what's a brand account?
3630520	3631360	I don't...
3633280	3636040	All right, round three.
3636040	3637840	Third time's a charm, thank you Paul.
3641080	3646080	I wanna see, I wanna see, is it gonna work?
3646080	3647560	Come on, speak.
3651280	3653840	The punches of love, oh no.
3653840	3658840	No, no, oh brother.
3662040	3664640	It's so shib over.
3664640	3666920	You probably only have to worry about the brand account thing
3666920	3669880	if your account is really old, that's a good point.
3670520	3672760	Okay guys, stop for real.
3672760	3674480	You gotta need to calm down.
3677880	3680400	Someone just paypal my bro like five bucks
3680400	3681600	and call it a day.
3682760	3684520	I'm getting soaked, oh.
3685720	3688480	Punch the mic, punch the mic, punch the mic.
3688480	3689320	No.
3691640	3692480	Oh my.
3695360	3697440	It doesn't end, okay.
3698440	3699840	You poor thing.
3699840	3702840	All right, chat, I'm taking you close to my chest.
3704720	3706800	I love you guys so much.
3706800	3709600	It's got you, your luck is just not good.
3710960	3715600	As I'm giving you a kiss, mwah, mwah.
3715600	3718000	Oh my god, okay.
3718000	3719720	Is this a game to you guys?
3719720	3720560	Oh my god.
3720680	3721520	Mwah.
3724200	3729200	Guys, guys, calm, the ward is, did he get it?
3732040	3733280	No, he still did.
3735120	3737480	Guys, this is, stop, stop, stop, stop.
3737480	3739640	The gacha needs to end, guys, stop.
3739640	3741240	Thank you, thank you.
3741240	3742920	On a gorilla stream.
3744880	3746240	Oh my god, thank you, hold on.
3746240	3747200	Let me say thank you.
3747200	3749120	Thank you, viewer lover.
3749160	3751160	Thank you, dragon and Dante.
3752520	3754320	And Dante, dragon and Dante.
3754320	3755560	Thank you, Paul, again.
3755560	3757000	Thank you, Joker.
3757000	3758360	Thank you, average amphibian.
3758360	3759640	You're not average.
3759640	3760600	You're great.
3760600	3761920	Thank you, Ken, at 30.
3764120	3765840	Oh my god.
3767440	3769000	You could be a lucky recipient
3769000	3771040	of a Shippee-Kan-Wambiola membership.
3773280	3774620	Oh my goodness.
3776440	3778080	Oh my god.
3778080	3779480	Thank you, Usmami.
3781200	3782040	Next one.
3783200	3784960	Next one, did he get it?
3787720	3789400	Did he, no, no.
3790680	3791520	No.
3792440	3795920	I think it's an ultra rare, apparently I'm not eligible.
3795920	3798080	Okay, that explains a lot then.
3798080	3802040	Oh no, oh guys, see that's why I told you to stop
3802040	3805080	because I'm like, there's probably something else going on.
3805080	3807720	That's preventing him from getting one.
3807720	3809760	He must have a brand account then.
3809760	3813200	Oh, it was rigged from the start, guys.
3813200	3816040	No, you tried.
3816040	3817840	Thank you for the gifted.
3817840	3820840	That's why I was like, stop, stop.
3820840	3821680	Oh.
3824720	3827400	But congrats to everybody else who got gifted stuff
3827400	3828640	and now you can have my emotes.
3828640	3831580	My other emotes should be done at some point very soon.
3833320	3835320	Oh, the brand account debuff is real.
3835320	3837160	Thank you again, Joker.
3837160	3839160	You guys are absurd.
3839160	3841320	I guess this is like, you guys paying me
3841320	3844160	for the silly script that I read for you.
3844160	3845920	I'll have to split these with Emmy.
3845920	3850280	I'll be like, throw some money at her.
3850280	3853160	Just be like, there's your cut.
3855800	3858880	Yeah, you'd have to make a whole new account.
3858880	3860520	I don't care if I'm actually not eligible.
3860520	3864040	Oh, but you should probably get that checked out, bro.
3864040	3866500	And you get access to member streams, yes.
3867920	3870520	And then I have an archive karaoke
3870520	3875400	and when I come back from my vacation,
3875400	3877360	from the 18th to the 23rd,
3878320	3881200	and then we have a watch along on Monday.
3881200	3882040	What's the day?
3882040	3882880	Today's Saturday.
3885320	3887960	I have to go to my parents' house tomorrow.
3887960	3889000	So I get a suitcase,
3889000	3890800	because I forgot I don't have a suitcase.
3890800	3894000	Ooh, I got a sub, but doesn't tell me from who.
3894000	3895440	Yeah, say, make sure you say thank you.
3895440	3896840	Say thank you.
3897760	3899960	Thank you, everybody.
3899960	3903880	You will be green in madam's presence.
3903880	3906520	I was like, next time drinking is right.
3906520	3908040	Like if you don't, yeah, they're just emotes.
3908040	3910960	If you want to get an actual, you have to upgrade.
3912440	3913280	Oh my God.
3913280	3914440	Sorry, it's your favorite character.
3914440	3915920	My cat's food going off.
3917960	3919840	The gray harlot is still valid.
3919840	3921200	You're still appreciated and loved.
3921200	3922720	You still show up to my streams.
3922720	3923960	I still appreciate you.
3924960	3926560	As well as the Lurkers.
3929080	3932280	But yeah, we did a really fun tag list.
3932280	3934080	We watched Sucker Punch the other day.
3934080	3935360	It was really fun.
3937160	3939120	Yeah, so it's only a couple bucks.
3939120	3941360	I feel like I'm like shilling myself.
3941360	3944720	Check out my Patreon in the description below.
3944720	3947120	Check out Emmys' Patreon in the description below.
3947120	3948720	We'll actually go to her.
3948720	3950120	I don't think I have her Patreon
3950120	3951720	or any of the other girls' Patreon.
3952000	3954400	Um, go to her channel.
3954400	3956520	Stop to her Patreon.
3956520	3958000	That's all I'm gonna say.
3960000	3962160	I was once a gray harlot too, long time ago.
3962160	3965360	You were like, they were gray like five minutes ago.
3965360	3968000	My cats are eating.
3968920	3969840	Alphia is eating.
3969840	3971400	Hi, Pia.
3971400	3972560	Raina is asleep.
3972560	3975080	Raina is knocked out on the chair.
3975080	3976160	Raina, are you good?
3977880	3978720	Raina.
3979720	3981920	Raina, what are you doing?
3981920	3983000	Oh, you're licking your paws.
3983000	3983840	Okay, sorry.
3983840	3986480	And Boomi is knocked out on the cat tree.
3986480	3987320	He has passed out.
3987320	3988240	My little handsome man.
3988240	3989680	All his paws are all together.
3989680	3990520	He's very cute.
3991720	3993640	Just checking you're still streaming longer.
3996640	3997480	I don't know.
3997480	3998600	I was just talking.
4000280	4001280	I guess I'll stream longer.
4001280	4002200	It's only the least I can do
4002200	4004000	after getting a bazillion freaking gifted.
4004000	4004840	So yeah.
4005880	4007120	Where's Yappin?
4007120	4008320	Where Yappin?
4008320	4010800	You remember dogs and lizards over cats or reptiles?
4010800	4011640	Do I redirect her to you?
4011640	4013840	Yes, mom, you can.
4016560	4019480	Strani, I definitely recommend that you watch this VOD,
4019480	4020320	by the way.
4022240	4026320	At least like the first like 30 minutes to an hour
4026320	4027680	or like go through it
4027680	4029920	because you'll laugh because of me
4029920	4031760	and Amy did something funny.
4031760	4032600	Amy was on my stream.
4032600	4035600	Oh, thank you for the gift and Mr. Black's silence.
4035600	4038360	I've gifted Mr. Black's silence.
4038360	4040800	26, whose name makes me crack up every time I see it.
4042560	4044800	Well, I leave for 10 minutes and so many gifted.
4044800	4046000	Yeah.
4046000	4047800	People were trying to hit this one dude
4047800	4050920	with a gifted membership, but he moans
4050920	4053840	and then I think he just doesn't, he's a brand account.
4053840	4054680	Oh my God.
4056840	4057800	Very silly.
4057800	4059560	Okay, where is,
4059560	4060840	I feel like I need to make myself a little bit bigger.
4060840	4062200	I'm a little bit far away.
4062200	4064160	Let me get up close and personal.
4065800	4066920	With y'all.
4066920	4068400	Hi, welcome to my room.
4068400	4071800	Yes, I wear a sign on my shirt because YouTube hates me.
4071800	4073760	You know what? It's coming off.
4073760	4076440	A limiter coming off.
4079880	4082440	Everybody gets to see.
4082440	4085320	I'm not ashamed of myself anymore.
4087880	4089920	I am here to stay.
4092120	4093640	Imagine if I was flat, Tristan.
4093640	4094720	That'd just be weird.
4096440	4100160	But what if the justice,
4100160	4101960	I forgot to put my ooo-oo mouth on.
4103880	4105920	Wait, where'd my track go?
4105920	4107720	I want to see what you guys are saying.
4109480	4110960	She be on these.
4110960	4113720	YouTube hates body positivity.
4113720	4117280	I know, imagine my video just like disappears.
4118200	4119620	Cutting bird.
4119620	4121120	Well, I could take them off.
4122920	4124720	Actually, let me see if I can do that.
4125920	4128160	I think I could take them off.
4128160	4129560	Can I take them off my boobs?
4131320	4133160	I feel like this is a bad idea for me to try,
4133160	4134560	just like I did when I accidentally was changing
4134560	4136320	my skin color on stream.
4136320	4139000	Let's not do that.
4139000	4140360	Let's not do that.
4144880	4146960	I would, so I wouldn't remove that.
4146960	4151200	Like I wouldn't, it just,
4151200	4153040	I would just make myself transparent.
4153040	4154080	They would just be transparent.
4154080	4156120	So you guys would be able to see through me.
4158000	4160400	Shawty, Mama Raid.
4160400	4161800	Hello.
4161800	4164240	I hope you have your giggle sticks ready.
4164240	4166720	Cause we're about to shlorp, shlorp.
4166720	4167560	I'm sorry.
4170120	4172600	Oh my God, my headphones are dying.
4172600	4174040	Hi, writers.
4176600	4177560	Hello, Raiders.
4177560	4179000	Welcome in.
4180080	4183160	I have no idea where you guys are up through this stream.
4183160	4185000	You'll laugh really hard, mom.
4186360	4187680	You'll laugh really hard, Shawty.
4187680	4189640	If you watched like the first hour of it,
4189640	4190960	or a little bit less.
4190960	4193320	Is this the R greeting session?
4196040	4198560	We might have read the first script
4198560	4201920	and heavily censored it because of how silly it was.
4203440	4204360	Herm.
4204360	4205240	Did she win?
4205240	4206840	Was she winning?
4206840	4208440	Was she winning, Riftlands?
4208440	4209960	Did she win Baltaro?
4210840	4212480	Baltaro?
4212480	4213720	Was she winning?
4213720	4215400	Strony equals Shibi's top?
4215400	4216240	What?
4217840	4218680	I don't know.
4218680	4220160	Honestly, I don't know the power dynamic
4220160	4221520	between me and Strony.
4221520	4224120	Oh my God, here we go again.
4224120	4227160	Thank you a third of the time he gifted.
4227160	4228800	Jesus Christ.
4228800	4230560	He did so great.
4230560	4231400	I'm glad.
4232840	4234560	Remember to like and subscribe.
4234560	4236680	Have all three flinks to support Shibi.
4236680	4238280	Oh yeah, like and subscribe.
4238280	4239600	Also send that love over to Amy
4239600	4241640	cause she was on over here as well.
4241640	4243880	Don't forget to like, comment and subscribe.
4243880	4246880	On any of our VODs and streams,
4246880	4250760	just like at Strony's.
4250760	4254320	I can't even talk because people won't stop gifting.
4254320	4256880	Guys, relax.
4258080	4261920	Thank you to X2Doki for the 10 gifted.
4261920	4263320	My God.
4264960	4266240	The gotcha must flow.
4266240	4267680	It's literally like just like pull
4267680	4268520	and hope that you win.
4268520	4269360	Oh my.
4270320	4273560	Thank you for the 20 gifted Paul, but yeah.
4273560	4274880	Oh my God.
4277600	4278640	I'm so good at dodging.
4278640	4279640	You're good at dodging too.
4279640	4281520	Everybody's dodging.
4281520	4283000	Everybody's taught like all my Lakers
4283000	4284760	are poking popping up like did I win?
4287000	4288560	Hopefully.
4288560	4291360	Guys, at this rate, I'm going to literally
4293600	4296400	have only greenies.
4296400	4298120	No harlot left behind.
4298120	4301240	Yeah, everybody should be able to use the emotes.
4301240	4304640	Oh, you guys are so sweet.
4304640	4306440	I'm pretty sure I can get gifted membership.
4306440	4307520	It's just my luck, I guess.
4307520	4310240	It is very, very odd.
4311960	4312800	You know what?
4312800	4314640	I honestly don't care about getting a membership.
4314640	4317440	I'm just happy to support a Vtuber I like watching.
4318960	4320920	I don't even need a Vtuber.
4320920	4323480	Whatever guys, I don't need a membership from you guys.
4323480	4324320	Whatever.
4325320	4328480	No, but you're right.
4328480	4331000	I still appreciate you even if your name is gray,
4331000	4332160	even if you're a Laker,
4332160	4335080	as long as you watch and support me and the girls,
4335080	4336800	that's all that really matters.
4336800	4337800	Thank you.
4339560	4341040	Thank you, Average and Phibian.
4341040	4343080	Is this going to be a stream of me just saying thank you
4343080	4344240	for all the gifted?
4344240	4347280	Thank you, Average and Phibian for the 10 gifted.
4347280	4349120	Believe me more.
4349120	4352920	Plop, plop, plop, good gifted, good gifted, good gifted.
4352920	4355760	Sundare Chat, Sundare Streamer, it works.
4357640	4359520	Maybe I don't want a cool sticker.
4359520	4361400	Maybe I don't want a cool sticker.
4361400	4363040	Maybe I just want to be plain.
4365800	4367280	If it is when I'm out of here,
4367280	4368120	what do you mean?
4368120	4368960	Where are you going?
4368960	4369920	Get the fuck back here.
4369920	4371520	You don't get to leave.
4371520	4372720	You thought you could leave.
4372720	4375000	You thought you could leave.
4375000	4375840	You don't get to go.
4375840	4377320	Oh, wait, guys, I've,
4377320	4378920	since there's a lot of you here.
4383920	4385920	Jay Santorillo.
4388920	4392920	Hey, welcome to the members, the members here.
4396920	4398920	Do you like my reverb?
4401920	4404920	Should we, should we start singing songs?
4409920	4410920	Hold on.
4410920	4411920	Where's my,
4411920	4413920	can I put on the cute and funny?
4415920	4416920	Hi, everybody.
4416920	4419920	It's me, British Stevie, once more.
4419920	4420920	Hello.
4420920	4424920	Thank you so much for all of the gifted subs.
4424920	4426920	You are also very sweet.
4426920	4428920	I appreciate you so much.
4430920	4432920	You've been reverbed.
4433920	4435920	Get reverbed, get reverbed, get reverbed.
4436920	4438920	As long as you don't start singing
4438920	4441920	the Darren Waller classic Cook On Shibs.
4442920	4444920	Oh, I'm Jeet Shibathani.
4444920	4445920	Hi, yes.
4445920	4447920	I'm Shibathani's British sister.
4448920	4450920	I'm not the older one that's in Britain.
4450920	4452920	I'm the younger one that's in Britain.
4452920	4454920	The older one sounds like this.
4454920	4456920	She talks like this.
4459920	4460920	Yeah.
4460920	4461920	Well, go on, Solar.
4461920	4463920	I never stopped working.
4463920	4464920	Let's see.
4464920	4465920	Let me think of a song to sing.
4465920	4467920	I need to put in my right headphones for this
4467920	4469920	because I'm using my different headphones.
4470920	4472920	I need to put in my IEMs for this.
4473920	4476920	Doing your shit, Britannia.
4479920	4480920	Oh, my God.
4480920	4482920	This fucking echo.
4482920	4484920	Echo, echo.
4488920	4490920	Sing me a song.
4490920	4491920	Wait, what's that song?
4491920	4493920	Let me take the echo down.
4493920	4495920	What's the viewer about?
4496920	4498920	Oh, Misty.
4498920	4500920	Whoa, my voice cracked.
4508920	4510920	How I just hurt my mouth.
4510920	4513920	It's like bumped my straw against my gum.
4513920	4514920	Ow.
4514920	4516920	Hi, Boomi.
4516920	4518920	Oh, thank you for that.
4518920	4521920	I was just a gifted because I'm so used to saying gifted.
4521920	4523920	The gifted, the gifted.
4524920	4526920	Boomi, why are you going in the box?
4526920	4528920	A viewer lover.
4528920	4529920	Thank you for the $5.
4529920	4532920	Dr. P, thank you for the 10 gift.
4532920	4533920	Guys.
4533920	4537920	You're absolutely fucking going bonkers right now.
4538920	4540920	How I'm the grafted.
4544920	4546920	Oh, my God.
4546920	4547920	It will never stop.
4547920	4550920	It's just going to be a constant stream.
4551920	4552920	Get spoiled.
4552920	4553920	Get spoiled.
4553920	4555920	God, I don't deserve this.
4555920	4556920	I don't deserve this.
4556920	4557920	Stop it.
4557920	4558920	Okay.
4558920	4560920	This song.
4560920	4561920	Hold on.
4561920	4563920	I need to look at the lyrics.
4563920	4564920	It goes out to Strawny.
4564920	4565920	I want to do this.
4565920	4569920	I want to, uh, I want to clap on this song with her.
4576920	4579920	I'm not going to put the music because then everything will just get claimed.
4581920	4587920	Oh, misty high up the mountain below.
4588920	4589920	Keep careful.

8353480	8355480	I ain't happy.
8355480	8359480	I'm feeling glad I got sunshine in a bag.

8370480	8373480	Finally, someone let me out of my cage.
8373480	8376480	Now, time is for me for nothing because I'm counting no age.

8388480	8391480	Pick and choose, sit and lose all your different crews.
8391480	8394480	Chicks and dudes who you think is really kicking tunes.
8394480	8397480	Picture you getting down in a picture tube.
8397480	8398480	Like you lift the fuse.
8398480	8401480	You think it's fictional, mystical, maybe.
8401480	8405480	Spiritual, hero who appears in you to clear your view when you're too crazy.
8405480	8409480	Lifeless, but to those who definition for life is priceless to you
8409480	8412480	because I put you on the hype shit you like it.
8412480	8414480	Done smoking righteous with one token.

8445480	8446480	The essence, the basics.
8446480	8447480	Without it, you make it.
8447480	8451480	Allow me to make this childlike in nature rhythm.
8451480	8452480	You have it or you don't.
8452480	8453480	That's a fallacy.
8453480	8454480	I'm in them.
8454480	8455480	Every sprout and tree.
8455480	8456480	Every child piece.

8468480	8471480	Y'all can see me now because you don't see with your eye.
8471480	8473480	You perceive with your mind.
8473480	8474480	That's the inner.
8474480	8477480	So I'm a stick around with Russ and be a mentor.
8477480	8478480	That's a few rhymes.
8478480	8481480	So motherfuckers remember what the thought is.
8481480	8485480	I brought all this so you can survive when law is lawless.
8485480	8488480	Feeling sensations that you thought was dead.
8488480	8489480	No squealing.
8489480	8491480	Remember that's all in your head.
8491480	8492480	I ain't happy.
8492480	8496480	I'm feeling glad I got sunshine in a bag.

11827360	11832560	the type of reception that we've gotten it's really nice it's hotter with the purr sorry i
11832560	11839520	said my desk reina what's up mama come on she's like purring so hard on my shoulder
11839680	11846960	all right have a good night we get to hear burps and she's feeling i know sometimes
11846960	11851760	i used to give them out willy nilly but now i'm like you know what i'm too nice let me withhold
11851760	11858480	my burps because you know i'm running an establishment as madame of wonderland a
11858480	11863280	hotel that also doubles as a brothel don't tell anybody and i'm the madame of that establishment
11864240	11870880	uh it's only fair that a woman of my caliber upholds her professionalism while streaming to the masses
11870880	11878400	you know my favorite moment of view was when you had three heads on top of one in your chest
11878960	11880480	yeah be not afraid
11884560	11890320	so now we're kidding her reina makes you think of a gender swapped reign from the owl house
11890320	11891920	i never watched owl house as a kid
11899280	11904640	boomy king of umashu and he was another one of my cats he was in my desk with his paws crossed
11904640	11910000	like a gentleman i don't know where fia the deathbed companion who's my other cat her name is actually
11910000	11913920	fia the deathbed companion by the way because i love elden ring that much i think she's sleeping
11913920	11920640	under my bed boomy why are you just like laying his head in my hand
11929760	11933360	you're mad though because i touched his shoulder he only likes his head pat and now he's grooming
11933360	11937600	himself named us another cat d that would be so funny
11938320	11945280	what's a game that all the six dealer girls want to collab together one day well we wanted to do
11945280	11952000	power wash simulator but it didn't work out it like the for someone reason it just wasn't working
11952000	11955920	it like it would crash when there was four of us in there and you can have up to six people it was
11955920	11963280	really weird so i would like to play power wash simulator and i oh my god in the worst way i want
11963280	11970960	to play prop hunt and gary's mod i i have like over just like i have over 600 hours in counter
11970960	11977600	strike and i have over 600 hours in gary's mod because all i would do was play trouble in terraced
11977600	11985600	town in prop hunt and it was so great also uno yes i want to play uno i love if we had to play
11985680	11991760	like prop hunt with the you may plus girls or like with my thos it would be so funny so funny
11994400	11999680	so i'm trying to convince the girls to buy um very small it's only like five bucks or
11999680	12003360	i think might have been on five bucks for the steam sale but i think that's over so might be nine again
12004000	12004480	for ten
12007840	12015200	and i'm a i'm a prop hunt veteran so gonna go yes go to sleep go to sleep thank you so much
12015200	12019600	for your support and thank you for the song suggestions thank you gt you three different
12019600	12024320	youtuber agencies would be cool crazy it really would though it really would
12026800	12029840	you don't need counter strike source for some apps yeah that's true i forgot sometimes you
12029840	12034720	did desource for some of the maps nowadays i think you can just like download most of them out
12034720	12042160	mod packs oh my god i probably just do like the minecraft map one of my faves or office
12042160	12047920	i clocked seven forty five hours just messing with friends playing so they capture the classic
12047920	12054480	games you see plus mine so that strani would probably like thrive in that game she would i
12054480	12059920	think she would like it a lot i just i would love hearing her scream when she get discovered she'd
12059920	12066000	be like all right three flings i don't think they all fucking shit now they spotted me and then
12066000	12072000	she just fucking runs off i think it'd be so so funny
12075040	12078320	counter strike source is defensive or some random stuff but it happened or not that's
12078320	12084960	true honestly i'll buy it for everyone i literally i just don't give a shit be like here we go the
12084960	12093760	masses want gary's mod the masses will get gary's mod i can already hear mercy screaming whether
12093760	12102080	she's the hunter being hunted guys and then when she's chasing one of us to be like i can't do her
12102080	12106720	wait let me think of her laugh can't do her laugh that well
12111280	12114160	and then she'd laugh and like shoot us explode us
12114640	12124560	okay hey do do your part tell the other girls hey you guys should play this game because get
12124560	12129760	those suggestions out there if you watch the other girls and i hope you do give them their suggestions
12130480	12136080	tell them what's up i guess strani do impressions she does too many of them well
12136800	12145520	strani does really funny american accents i think i remember she was like trying to be southern
12145520	12152000	ones and i'm like what is this strani's rage heals my soul as well some scottish rage is a
12152000	12157440	different type of rage yes cool
12164000	12168560	you know we all get really goofy i think we really just like become our truest selves
12168560	12172720	in a collab especially the among us collab i can't get over how fun that was the among us
12172720	12178240	collab i want to do that again so bad i'm thinking of having some of my um friends on for the next
12178240	12184480	one like uh nori and chai chan it can be really fun
12187760	12190880	and then yeah emi and ic didn't get to do it last night last time
12192080	12194240	so i have a whole cute and funny and then there's me
12196080	12197680	i bet i could get like hexa and stuff
12200000	12203120	can't be funny some of the other hickenwashi girls
12203200	12211360	watch the clip of the among us collab in a sense of freaking funny yeah it was so funny
12211360	12216000	and it was well edited there was one i think that uh discount ostrich made he did like a really
12216000	12221360	meanie one that was really good shout out to discount ostrich he makes really good compilations
12221360	12231200	of us um and he did one of the among us collab and it was literally just so funny and then like
12231760	12237120	distrawni just like tricking all of us and like i knew i was on distrawni so many times when i
12237120	12240880	doubted myself because i'm like no she would never do that and then i was like why didn't i
12240880	12247280	listen to my gut i knew these people were the freaking uh imposters i would also like to do
12247280	12251360	like town of salem um i love you still love playing town of salem
12254160	12257120	and i feel like that would be kind of better because then we wouldn't have to move around
12257120	12260480	as much we could just like talk and just debate the entire time i think that'd be funny
12261920	12268000	i'm drunk hello mom are you behaving young man you can only drink at the house you know make sure
12268000	12276560	you're safe town of salem super dead oh no i know i haven't played that in a long time i've seen
12276560	12282560	like there's like among us adaptations of it so i think maybe that the company was absorbed or whatever
12284640	12289280	and then they started with just angrily shouting i remember someone accused her but switched it up
12289280	12294640	when you all caught on literally she was like i'll be quiet almost like something's up
12304960	12309840	all right i'm getting eepy i have a lot to do tomorrow i have to go
