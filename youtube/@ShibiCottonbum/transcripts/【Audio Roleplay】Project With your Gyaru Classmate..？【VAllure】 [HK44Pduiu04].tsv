60000	62000	You
90000	92000	You
120000	122000	You
150000	152000	You
180000	182000	You
210000	212000	You
240000	256000	I'm talking now my voice is too low. If I could really close, yes.
256000	268000	I've worked on this for several hours and if it's still not working, then I'm gonna cry.
286000	304000	It's not working. I'm using you.
304000	310000	I'm really gonna cry.
310000	324000	It's still too quiet.
324000	328000	I don't know.
328000	332000	Does that work?
332000	338000	Hello?
338000	348000	Oh, my cheek is still white.
348000	358000	Can you hear me?
358000	362000	Okay, I'm really sad.
362000	370000	Nothing's working today and I'm kind of upset.
370000	382000	The one thing that was bothering me is that I couldn't change one of my eyelashes to the right color because the mesh is just not working.
382000	392000	I apologize if you can hear my AC.
392000	402000	I'll put on some rain.
402000	414000	I hope the rain helps.
414000	430000	I didn't want to cancel though because I wanted to spend time with you today.
430000	448000	I have allergies. That's why I'm sniffling by the way.
448000	464000	My head would stay connected to my body.
464000	476000	Do you think I look cute?
476000	486000	Do I look nice?
486000	490000	I also think there's a delay.
490000	506000	Again, I don't know why.
506000	512000	She needs reassurance. She's been stressed out today.
512000	520000	I'm working with stuff and I'm tired of technology.
520000	534000	I'm moving the model with my mouth so I'm not all the way over here.
534000	546000	Hi, my name is Sheeby Cottonbomb and today we're going to be doing an ASMR.
546000	552000	It's going to be Improv ASMR.
552000	564000	I'm kind of mad that my stream is not doing the right latency because Improv is needed and chat interaction is needed.
564000	576000	Sorry if I sniffle in your ear.
576000	592000	I should change the title to You Give Yaro Sheeby Therapy because she's stressed out.
592000	596000	What do you mean I'm just ahead?
596000	602000	I don't know what you're talking about.
602000	608000	My allergies are kidding me this morning.
608000	612000	I don't feel good.
612000	620000	I'm having a pain flare up so I don't really feel good right now either.
620000	626000	I won't get my white cheek.
626000	628000	Let me fix that.
628000	634000	This might be very scuffed ASMR. I apologize.
634000	642000	I'm still pissed. I can't color my one eyelash.
642000	646000	Did I?
646000	650000	I should have posted on the wrong account.
650000	656000	Oh my god, I'm going to lose a guy this way.
676000	680000	I'm sorry.
680000	686000	I'm sorry.
686000	692000	I'm sorry.
692000	698000	I'm sorry.
698000	712000	I'm sorry.
712000	722000	Yeah, it's one of those things.
722000	728000	I'll probably just cut all of this out of the vod.
728000	746000	What was I going to do? I was going to color my cheek.
746000	750000	I can't do that right now. It doesn't matter.
750000	752000	No, it doesn't matter to me.
752000	758000	I'm very...
758000	762000	Don't worry about how my head is disconnected.
762000	768000	I'm very...
768000	772000	I don't really know how to explain that I'm not myself today.
772000	780000	But I'm not myself today, as you can see.
780000	788000	I'm almost wishing I could be babyed right now.
788000	798000	Hold on.
798000	800000	Now you throw my head in the trash.
800000	806000	Anyways, how's it going?
806000	810000	One moment.
810000	826000	I will remind you that my Bunspeak accent comes out when I'm...
826000	832000	feeling some types of way.
832000	836000	But don't worry.
836000	840000	It'll change.
840000	844000	Is there a voice in the background?
844000	848000	It's my desktop audio.
848000	854000	Do you like my bedroom? I took it from Canvo.
854000	876000	No.
876000	882000	Nobody can see that, right?
882000	890000	Maybe I should not do this on stream.
890000	892000	Don't look.
892000	914000	Don't look.
914000	934000	Don't worry about it.
934000	938000	That's close enough.
938000	948000	Ahem.
948000	952000	I love that.
952000	962000	I look very cute. I can't wait to get hands.
962000	966000	I'm stressing.
966000	972000	Okay, yeah.
972000	976000	Yaru Dolhan gets babyed by chat, maybe.
976000	982000	Okay, um, how long?
982000	986000	Okay, I've been streaming for 16 minutes.
986000	990000	I won't cut 16 minutes.
990000	994000	So the roleplay today is going to be improved.
994000	1002000	It's going to be more scuffed than you think it is, because I'm kind of doing stuff off the rip.
1002000	1012000	I'm going to do all the doughnose and stuff at the end and all that.
1012000	1020000	Yeah.
1020000	1022000	What if I told you, like, you want this color?
1022000	1028000	Not good, because I'm going to be this color eventually.
1028000	1036000	Um, so this is going to require some chat interaction.
1036000	1040000	Are you ready to rumble?
1040000	1046000	I have some stuff.
1046000	1056000	I'm used to this scuff, madam. It's fine.
1056000	1070000	Why am I holding your hair?
1070000	1080000	Hmm.
1080000	1086000	What was that about?
1086000	1092000	You're sleepy already?
1092000	1098000	The scene is, you're my classmate.
1098000	1116000	Why did you over my house?
1116000	1124000	Why did you over my house?
1124000	1130000	Because we can work on a project together.
1130000	1136000	My body's going to be jumping back and forth.
1136000	1142000	It's a rainy day.
1142000	1148000	And you don't have any power at your house.
1148000	1152000	So we're doing that at mine. I hope you don't mind.
1152000	1156000	Is that okay with you?
1156000	1162000	It better be okay with you. You don't really have a choice in this.
1162000	1170000	This is my bedroom.
1170000	1174000	I'm going to...
1174000	1194000	I'm going to put my body on the bed and you can stare at her from over there.
1194000	1204000	This is mine.
1204000	1214000	Pink is my favorite color.
1214000	1240000	I'm going to start now.
1240000	1248000	Hey, yeah. You can put yourself anywhere. Make yourself at home.
1248000	1256000	I guess we better get ready and get started on that project.
1256000	1262000	Did you remember to bring the assignment?
1262000	1264000	No.
1264000	1268000	Do you even remember what the assignment is?
1268000	1272000	You don't?
1272000	1274000	I knew I shouldn't have partnered with you.
1274000	1278000	I was hoping that you'd do all the work because I thought you were one of the smarter kids.
1278000	1282000	I guess I was wrong. I guess you're just still dumb.
1282000	1284000	What's that on my bed?
1284000	1286000	Oh, it's just my body.
1286000	1290000	Don't worry about that.
1290000	1296000	Sorry if my AC's loud. It has been a pretty hot one out there.
1296000	1302000	Please don't stare at her though. That's kind of rude. Please don't stare at my body.
1302000	1308000	She's, you know, just trying to hang out.
1308000	1312000	You fell asleep in class when the teacher was telling us?
1312000	1320000	I would never have ever thought that from you. Have you been getting sleep?
1320000	1328000	Alright. Maybe you should work on getting better sleep.
1328000	1336000	Well, so, we have a history project.
1336000	1352000	It has to do with 18th century literature and its impact on history.
1352000	1362000	I think. Hold on. Let me go on my phone real quick. I'll tell you what the teacher emailed me.
1362000	1368000	Hold on.
1368000	1370000	No.
1370000	1380000	Oh my god, where's this freaking email?
1380000	1388000	My phone turned into a book.
1388000	1402000	Oh, it's the history of magic. That's what it is. That's why I managed to turn my phone into a book.
1402000	1410000	My body's holding the phone. I have two phones.
1410000	1418000	You only know about 17th century literature? You're going to be absolutely useless.
1418000	1428000	Can we look at the history of anthropomorphic girls? I think that's a little bit off topic.
1428000	1436000	Anyways, you can come and sit with me on the bed and we can start.
1436000	1442000	Did you bring your notebook with you for class?
1442000	1448000	You did? Okay. Cool.
1448000	1452000	Hold on. Let me just tuck my head on my body.
1452000	1458000	Give me a moment.
1458000	1466000	Hold on. My head's still a little bit too big.
1466000	1480000	Him.
1480000	1486000	Why don't you come sit?
1486000	1495000	Just make yourself comfortable. Just come sit down.
1495000	1498000	Is there a problem?
1498000	1502000	Yeah, you can sit on my butt. Where else are you going to sit? That chair?
1502000	1510000	I guess you could sit there too if you wanted to, but it will be easier if you sit nice and close to me.
1510000	1526000	Let me grab my notebook.
1526000	1536000	Okay, I got it.
1536000	1542000	Alright, so do you mind if I copy some of your notes?
1542000	1548000	Can you lay on my lap? Well, that's a little bit too close for comfort.
1548000	1556000	Yeah, and you're either close to me so I can read your notes and copy some of them.
1556000	1560000	Okay? Thank you.
1560000	1566000	Alright, so you said that you would do this.
1566000	1570000	You would do that.
1570000	1576000	What does that say? What does that say? I can't really read your writing.
1576000	1580000	What is it? I'll come back to that later, I guess.
1580000	1584000	Okay.
1584000	1590000	And then you're right there.
1590000	1596000	Okay, what if I...
1596000	1606000	I'm not coincidentally wrong.
1606000	1608000	You put...
1608000	1614000	You regard an eye.
1614000	1618000	That's alright. My handwriting is best you do.
1618000	1624000	I'm getting bored reading all your stupid words anyways.
1624000	1630000	I thought you were supposed to be the smart one. I think my notes are better than yours.
1630000	1638000	I don't know if I should even bother copying these.
1638000	1644000	Yeah, you still spoke coincidentally incorrect.
1644000	1648000	Can you spell supercalifragilisticexpialidocious?
1648000	1652000	Thank you.
1660000	1664000	X-P-M-Dosh.
1664000	1672000	S-U-P-E-R-C-A-L-I-F-R-A-G.
1672000	1684000	I-L-I-S-T-I-C-E-X-P-I-A-L-A-D-O-C-I-O-U-S.
1684000	1692000	Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.
1692000	1696000	I'm sorry. That was correct.
1696000	1700000	Oh, you can spell it, right? You still hope.
1700000	1706000	Unless you're just typing what I just told you.
1706000	1710000	Even the sound of it is something quite atrocious.
1710000	1714000	Did you ever watch Mary Poppins?
1714000	1722000	I don't know.
1722000	1726000	Yeah, it's a real word.
1726000	1730000	Look it up. Wake up supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.
1730000	1734000	And then your mouth.
1734000	1738000	I'm going to pop my head on then.
1738000	1742000	I'm sorry.
1742000	1747000	I'm sorry.
1750000	1754000	I'm married Poppins, you know.
1754000	1758000	I think that we're even getting a little louder.
1758000	1763000	I hope you don't mind. You can still hear me, right?
1768000	1793000	Do you have another page I can copy?
1793000	1796000	Cool.
1796000	1803000	It's pretty humid outside.
1803000	1807000	I think I need a sharpener in my pencil, but I don't have a pencil sharpener.
1807000	1811000	Do you have a pencil I can borrow?
1811000	1818000	Did I hear about the drama between Stacy and her mom?
1818000	1822000	I heard that Stacy's mom has got it going on.
1822000	1824000	That's all I've heard though.
1824000	1830000	I don't know what you've heard.
1830000	1832000	Can we chew on your pencils?
1832000	1839000	I love chewing on pencils.
1839000	1855000	Pencil chewing.
1855000	1862000	It's quite tasty to be honest.
1862000	1865000	I don't like chewing on an eraser.
1865000	1872000	Thank you for letting me borrow your pencil that you want.
1872000	1874000	Have you ever seen Stacy's mom?
1874000	1875000	I haven't seen her.
1875000	1881000	Is she hot?
1881000	1883000	What does that word say?
1883000	1886000	I said what does that word say?
1886000	1888000	That one right there.
1888000	1892000	Can you tell me what that word says?
1892000	1894000	It says what?
1894000	1901000	You can't write that.
1901000	1904000	Why would you write that?
1904000	1909000	That wasn't part of the lesson.
1909000	1915000	I gotta sneeze.
1915000	1920000	Okay.
1920000	1922000	I don't think you're listening to me.
1922000	1924000	What does that say?
1924000	1927000	You don't know what it says?
1927000	1929000	Are you blind?
1929000	1930000	I think you're blind.
1930000	1932000	What's up with that?
1932000	1933000	I don't know.
1933000	1934000	It says something in the...
1934000	1936000	You're writing inappropriate things.
1936000	1937000	Is this not...
1937000	1941000	Are you writing inappropriate things?
1941000	1942000	I don't...
1942000	1944000	I'm just gonna skip that section
1944000	1947000	because I don't know what you were writing.
1947000	1949000	You're really weird.
1949000	1951000	You're like really really weird.
1951000	1954000	I wish we weren't lab partners.
1954000	1956000	It says street class but we're lab partners.
1956000	1958000	Don't question it.
1958000	1960000	We're partners in a lot of things.
1960000	1961000	What's up with that?
1961000	1964000	Why are you so...
1964000	1965000	You do need your glasses?
1965000	1971000	Then grab your glasses.
1971000	1974000	That says bloodonkers.
1974000	1978000	Why would you write bloodonkers?
1978000	1980000	Why are you so naughty?
1980000	1989000	That's really inappropriate.
1989000	1992000	What does that say?
1992000	1993000	Can you repeat...
1993000	1995000	Can you say this what you wrote out loud?
1995000	2004000	Because I need to hear you say it.
2004000	2007000	It's a history line, exactly.
2007000	2009000	We're always partners.
2009000	2011000	We're partners in biology.
2011000	2013000	We're partners in anatomy.
2013000	2016000	We're partners together in history class.
2016000	2020000	I'm kind of sick of seeing you in my face.
2020000	2022000	I didn't even want to light you over my house.
2022000	2024000	My mom said I had to light you over my house.
2024000	2026000	I didn't even want to light you over my house.
2026000	2028000	Because you're one of the kids and you're small weird.
2028000	2030000	You're one of the weird kids that sits alone.
2030000	2032000	And don't you like a minet or something?
2032000	2033000	What is it called?
2033000	2034000	Like cartoons?
2034000	2041000	Are you like a little too old for cartoons?
2041000	2042000	Peanuts?
2042000	2046000	What is peanuts?
2046000	2052000	I don't know what that means.
2052000	2054000	I don't...
2054000	2062000	What's going on here?
2062000	2066000	What's up with that?
2066000	2068000	Anime?
2068000	2072000	Whatever the fuck that is, I don't really care about it.
2072000	2074000	Why do you like anime?
2074000	2075000	Anime is weird.
2075000	2079000	Anime is for weirdos.
2079000	2081000	Your mom likes me though?
2081000	2086000	No, she doesn't.
2086000	2088000	Wait, now I have to ask her.
2088000	2098000	I'm weird sometimes.
2098000	2100000	What's this anime called?
2100000	2101000	You have a manga?
2101000	2102000	A manga?
2102000	2104000	A manga?
2104000	2106000	A manga?
2106000	2109000	What is...
2109000	2112000	You have a comic book in your backpack?
2112000	2116000	What does it say?
2116000	2119000	Is it in Japanese?
2119000	2122000	I can't read Japanese.
2122000	2123000	It's not in Japanese?
2123000	2126000	Oh, the cover is in Japanese.
2126000	2131000	Oh, I got those nipples.
2131000	2134000	Why do you have to read this from right to left?
2134000	2136000	That's really confusing.
2136000	2138000	A mango?
2138000	2144000	I wish I had a mango.
2144000	2150000	Your mom likes me, and if you keep being unpolite, I'm going to hit her.
2150000	2152000	Don't hit on my mom.
2152000	2154000	That's weird.
2154000	2155000	You're weirdo.
2155000	2161000	You like anime and you want to hit on people's moms?
2161000	2164000	What's...
2164000	2166000	It's called a dojinshi?
2166000	2168000	What is that?
2168000	2170000	Can I see it?
2170000	2172000	Give it to me.
2172000	2173000	Over.
2173000	2175000	Just let me see it.
2175000	2177000	Why are you fighting me?
2177000	2183000	Why would you bring it out of your backpack if you weren't going to show it to me?
2183000	2185000	Don't run away from me.
2185000	2188000	Hand it over.
2188000	2192000	Thank you very much.
2192000	2201000	Let me look through it.
2201000	2203000	I can't even see what this is saying.
2203000	2211000	Oh, mom.
2211000	2216000	Okay.
2216000	2222000	What the heck is this?
2222000	2228000	What are you reading?
2228000	2231000	What?
2231000	2233000	Did you just call me a baka?
2233000	2236000	What the heck is a baka?
2236000	2240000	Why are you looking at this stuff at school?
2240000	2241000	Wait, where did you get it?
2241000	2244000	How did you get this?
2244000	2249000	Did they help us in the school library?
2249000	2255000	Do you have more of this?
2255000	2258000	Is this kind of hot?
2258000	2261000	Is this kind of cool?
2261000	2265000	I can't tell what's going on.
2265000	2269000	Why can't I see through her?
2269000	2274000	That's a lot of liquid.
2274000	2276000	What is that?
2276000	2281000	Is that supposed to be what I think it's supposed to be?
2281000	2284000	It's a gyaru dosi?
2284000	2286000	What's a gyaru?
2286000	2289000	What's a gyaru?
2289000	2291000	Gyaru?
2291000	2294000	I don't know what that is.
2294000	2296000	My name is Shibi, right?
2296000	2298000	Yeah?
2298000	2301000	That's what my mom named me.
2301000	2306000	After the Queen of Shiba, African Princess.
2307000	2311000	I guess this is kind of cool.
2311000	2315000	It's kind of weird that you read this at school, though.
2315000	2325000	Do you, like, do anything about it?
2325000	2328000	I'm not so sure about this.
2328000	2331000	This is some graphic stuff.
2331000	2334000	Is it Japanese fashion trend?
2335000	2342000	Can you show me a picture on your phone?
2342000	2345000	I can't really tell what's going on in this picture.
2345000	2349000	It's like she's up high.
2349000	2354000	Her legs are kind of all over the place.
2354000	2356000	When you're bored at school, what do you do?
2356000	2358000	I don't think you do this.
2358000	2360000	I don't think you do that.
2360000	2362000	I don't think anybody does that.
2362000	2367000	Why would you do that?
2367000	2369000	You'd rather not say?
2369000	2371000	Why are you being shy with me?
2371000	2374000	Why did you take this out of your backpack then?
2374000	2376000	Huh? Tell me.
2376000	2378000	Why do you have this?
2378000	2387000	Where did you get this?
2387000	2389000	It's kind of weird that you have this.
2389000	2391000	The art's nice or whatever.
2391000	2398000	But, like, I don't...
2398000	2401000	I'm not sure about this one.
2401000	2404000	This is kind of weird.
2404000	2406000	You don't read it at school.
2406000	2409000	You're holding it for a friend.
2409000	2413000	You know, you do hang out with weird people.
2413000	2415000	And you do kind of smell bad.
2415000	2418000	Like...
2418000	2423000	Why do you smell so bad?
2423000	2427000	Yeah, my nose is stuffy, but I can still tell
2427000	2432000	that you smell so bad.
2432000	2434000	My God.
2434000	2436000	Do you, like, ever shower?
2436000	2440000	Like, didn't we have, like, gym class today?
2440000	2444000	When was the last time you showered?
2444000	2447000	I need to blow my nose.
2447000	2454000	Because I need to blow off this stinky...
2454000	2457000	Your shower is broken.
2457000	2459000	I guess you can, you know...
2459000	2462000	You can shower in my house if you want.
2462000	2464000	I'm sure my...
2464000	2465000	I have...
2465000	2467000	My older brother came, like...
2467000	2469000	Like, he borrowed someone's clothes.
2469000	2471000	I don't know if they'll fit you, though.
2471000	2474000	Maybe you can fit into my sister's clothes.
2474000	2476000	So if you decide to take a shower,
2476000	2479000	you can dress up in my sister's clothes.
2479000	2481000	Or, you know, you're kind of small.
2481000	2484000	Maybe you can fit my clothes.
2484000	2489000	I better have a t-shirt for you.
2489000	2491000	Yeah, I...
2491000	2493000	You're gonna...
2493000	2498000	You're gonna need that shower, I think.
2498000	2502000	Because, like...
2502000	2506000	Yeah, my sister.
2506000	2508000	Oh, my brother.
2508000	2510000	My sister, if it were that...
2510000	2511000	She doesn't have to know.
2511000	2513000	We have to tell her.
2513000	2515000	I read her panties all the time.
2515000	2523000	Don't tell her I said that.
2523000	2526000	Hmm...
2526000	2531000	Is my sister single?
2531000	2540000	Well, she's 14, so you tell me.
2540000	2542000	I just think we'd fit her clothes,
2542000	2548000	because you guys are, like, the same size.
2548000	2554000	I think I gotta sneeze again.
2554000	2556000	Ah!
2556000	2568000	She has cute clothes, and I like to take them.
2568000	2570000	I'm kidding.
2570000	2573000	She's my age.
2573000	2575000	And we're both in school.
2575000	2576000	We're literally in the same grade.
2576000	2577000	She's my twin sister.
2577000	2579000	You've seen her before.
2579000	2580000	Shibani?
2580000	2582000	You've seen Shibani?
2582000	2584000	That's my sister.
2584000	2586000	I'm Shibani.
2586000	2592000	And my sister is Shibani.
2592000	2596000	We have very different tastes.
2596000	2600000	My brother right now thinks he's, like, a London drill rapper.
2600000	2608000	He might be able to hear him in the next room.
2608000	2611000	Yeah, he's kind of weird.
2611000	2613000	Yeah, Shibani is darkness.
2613000	2614000	She calls herself that.
2614000	2619000	Her real name is really just, um...
2619000	2624000	Shibritney, but if she don't tell her, I told you that.
2624000	2628000	She hates her name.
2628000	2629000	I'm Shibethani.
2629000	2631000	She's technically Shibritney,
2631000	2634000	but she likes to be called Shibani.
2634000	2637000	Shibani.
2637000	2642000	I'm a really big family.
2642000	2646000	I need a sneeze.
2646000	2647000	That?
2647000	2649000	Phew!
2649000	2652000	I don't know my panic.
2652000	2655000	I'm not a strong sneeze.
2655000	2658000	I mean, don't worry about it.
2658000	2661000	Um, does she call me a prep?
2661000	2662000	Yeah, she does.
2662000	2665000	I don't know why she does that.
2665000	2666000	I don't know.
2666000	2668000	Does your brother have a sister complex?
2668000	2673000	I don't know what that means.
2673000	2674000	Does he have a stroke?
2674000	2675000	Should we call an ambulance?
2675000	2677000	Yeah, you know, we did that before,
2677000	2680000	but he just got mad at us.
2680000	2684000	So, it is what it is.
2684000	2686000	Thank you.
2686000	2692000	Um, I guess since I'm done copying your notes and stuff
2692000	2694000	and you showed me that weird book,
2694000	2697000	I'm just going to hop on the computer
2697000	2699000	and I'm going to, you know,
2699000	2702000	I'm just going to do some re...
2702000	2704000	I left my body behind.
2704000	2720000	Um, I'm just going to do some research.
2720000	2726000	Let me sit better in this chair.
2726000	2735000	My body is stuck.
2735000	2736000	There we go.
2736000	2743000	I was kind of, like, up in the air.
2743000	2750000	Okay, um, I'm not doing research on a weird thing.
2750000	2752000	On a weird book.
2752000	2761000	I'm just going to do some typing.
2761000	2769000	I need to set my keyboard up.
2769000	2774000	Don't worry when I'm looking up,
2774000	2785000	it's none of your business, okay?
2785000	2790000	You just say you think I look cute?
2790000	2792000	That's kind of weird for you to say.
2792000	2803000	We're just, we're just studying together.
2803000	2805000	Thanks, I guess.
2805000	2812000	You weirdo.
2812000	2814000	Whatever.
2814000	2830000	Anyways, I'm going to keep looking up the research.
2830000	2836000	Oh, there's a lot of these.
2836000	2840000	This doesn't really have to do with our project,
2840000	2846000	but it's very interesting.
2846000	2857000	How did you get into this dojinsha?
2857000	2861000	Anything about that?
2861000	2864000	Hey, my head's kind of staying on.
2864000	2867000	Nope, I'm slowly drifting away.
2867000	2877000	I don't know how that works.
2877000	2882000	Hmm.
2882000	2886000	Interesting.
2886000	2898000	I can drink a water.
2898000	2904000	Yeah, I drink cloud, whatever.
2904000	2910000	Do you have a problem?
2910000	2913000	Why did you send me a number?
2913000	2916000	You want me to look up a number?
2916000	2919000	Okay, what is it?
2919000	2928000	Okay, okay.
2928000	2931000	What is this?
2931000	2935000	A friend said the art reminded him of someone in our class.
2935000	2936000	Who did that?
2936000	2939000	Who did it look like in our class?
2939000	2942000	Who in our class looks like that?
2942000	2950000	Oh, my God.
2950000	2952000	Oh, my God.
2952000	2959000	This is what you like to look at?
2959000	2963000	I think I should just go back to the project,
2963000	2967000	because I don't even know if we should be in the same room together anymore.
2967000	2971000	It's kind of weird to me now.
2971000	2978000	It's kind of weird to me now, girl.
2978000	2984000	Anyways, I will continue to type up the paper.
2984000	2988000	Is that okay with you if I type up the paper?
2988000	2996000	Or do you want to type up the paper?
2996000	3008000	I don't want to look at the art you like anymore.
3008000	3010000	I don't really think this is art.
3010000	3012000	This is just weird.
3012000	3016000	Why are you so mean?
3016000	3018000	Come on, why?
3018000	3021000	Don't understand.
3021000	3023000	You want to type it?
3023000	3026000	You want me to type it?
3026000	3027000	I can type it.
3027000	3029000	You already wrote some strong bits.
3029000	3030000	Okay, fine.
3030000	3031000	Fine, fine, fine.
3031000	3034000	You can just lay on the bed.
3034000	3038000	Shoot me some ideas to write about for our literature,
3038000	3040000	history literature paper.
3040000	3051000	About 18th century literature, yeah.
3051000	3052000	What?
3052000	3066000	Okay, I can add that.
3066000	3067000	I don't like that word.
3067000	3073000	What's another word for big?
3073000	3077000	What's another word for big?
3077000	3079000	Yeah, I know, I could look it up in this episode.
3079000	3087000	I don't want.
3087000	3090000	What's another word for cylinder?
3090000	3095000	Big cylinder?
3095000	3097000	Humongous?
3097000	3103000	Okay, humongous cylinder, but from your own cylinder or something?
3103000	3110000	That cylinder is so basic.
3110000	3111000	Massive.
3111000	3112000	I like massive.
3112000	3117000	Massive cylinders are good.
3117000	3118000	Rod?
3118000	3119000	I get it.
3119000	3121000	Rod is a cylinder.
3121000	3123000	Shaft?
3123000	3130000	Hmm, let me see how it works.
3130000	3138000	In this essay, me and anonymous, I can call you that, right?
3138000	3139000	Yeah?
3139000	3140000	Okay.
3140000	3155000	Will be analyzing the historical importance of humongous rods in 18th century literature.
3155000	3159000	Yes, I think that's good.
3159000	3170000	Do you think that does that sound okay to you?
3170000	3171000	No credit?
3171000	3173000	What do you mean no credit?
3173000	3174000	That's your name.
3174000	3177000	You write that every time I look at your paper.
3177000	3179000	I'm not cheating on you or anything.
3179000	3181000	I'm not cheating off of you.
3181000	3185000	I mean, it's not like we were together in the first place.
3185000	3187000	It's not like I could cheat on you anyway.
3187000	3189000	It's not like I ignored it suddenly.
3189000	3192000	I mean, cheat off your papers.
3192000	3194000	I mean, no, I don't.
3194000	3195000	No, I don't.
3195000	3196000	How can you cheat off your papers?
3196000	3212000	You write your name as anonymous, so I thought that was your name.
3212000	3224000	Let me, I'm just going to Google some photos for the insert into the paper of humongous
3224000	3227000	rods in 18th century.
3227000	3228000	Okay.
3228000	3236000	Humongous rods in 18th century literature.
3236000	3239000	Excuse me.
3239000	3249000	Oh, I didn't know they had this sort of stuff back then, but this is not what I meant.

3354480	3370480	Does anybody know? Because I don't know. Do you know what the author's name was? I can't really remember. I have a really bad memory.
3371480	3381480	Why do I think the teacher is quite the killer? So if we write this stuff, I don't know if we're not in the mood. It's fine. It's fine.
3382480	3398480	Oh yeah, Hugh Janus. Yeah, okay. Yeah, but the author's Hugh and Janus. Well, the Janus or Janus? Janus? Okay.
3398480	3416480	Oh yeah, I forgot about the author, Mike Coney. Mike Coney was very prevalent. Very important in this day and age. Let me look up Mike Coney.

3458480	3479480	I'll add that in. Oh, the teacher mentioned something about a very important event over. Oh my gosh, you're right. I see. I'm kind of, you know what?
3479480	3494480	I apologize for picking on you earlier. You see, I know that you're really smart and I'm sorry that sometimes I take you for granted and I'm really sorry about that.
3494480	3512480	I'm sorry for all the names I called you behind your back. Like, I called you stinky and I thought you were weird and I said you were dumb and I said you have no friends and no one will love you and that you're a piece of trash, but I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it, okay?
3512480	3529480	Um, but let me add that stuff. The reconnaissance or the renaissance?
3530480	3540480	Okay. There's a lot of good names. Thank you. Keep them coming. Keep them coming. Keep them coming.
3540480	3569480	Hmm. There's a lot of good information. Especially after the earthquake in Italy during a holy day. Okay. Do you kind of like when I insult you?
3570480	3579480	Do you like when I insult you? That's weird.
3600480	3626480	It was the start of the enlightenment. Yes, but that was 16th century. It was not 18th century. Thank you, other classmate, that's happened to poke her head into the room.
3626480	3655480	Okay. I messed up. I need to raise this tie by a graph. Oh, I can hold down the button. Oh. Anyway. You have self-esteem problems? Why do you have self-esteem problems? You don't need self-esteem problems.
3655480	3680480	I know you smell bad, but I guess you're a little cute. Only a little. Forget I said it. You're still weird. I'm not talking through after this project.
3685480	3700480	That's a lot of typing.

3726480	3754480	What did you say? You want me to go out with you? I can't do that. My mom says I'm not allowed to date. I'll think about it.
3754480	3767480	Oh. Those are images. I don't think we can include this in our project. I need a tissue.
3767480	3796480	Can you pass me the tissue? This is my normal thing now. You're rubbing a tissue over your face before you get it.
3796480	3818480	I think I hear my mom coming. She's probably going to ask us if we want any food, so you can tell her what you want.
3818480	3844480	Honey, did you and your friend want to snack? Oh, you'll tell me later. All right. Keep me in the nose, sweetheart.
3844480	3862480	You've got to tell me what you want, and then I'll tell my mom. Oh, hi. I think we have more classmates joining us for our project.
3862480	3870480	We are writing about 18th century literature and its impact on history.
3870480	3881480	My name is Shababani.
3881480	3908480	Stop saying my mom is hot. She's nice, but she's not hot. My aunt taught her. My aunt, she'd be really hot. She runs a hotel. It's really cool. I'm not there sometimes. She lets me swim in the pool. You like pool?

3928480	3939480	My mom? I don't know what the other one is.
3940480	3953480	I haven't seen her talk to anybody. She never brings people around. And if they do, they're usually wearing a mask, and usually it's a weird scary mask, and mom doesn't like it when she brings them around.
3953480	3961480	They're also on leashes. I don't know why. But I like the style, though. That's why I wear this collar. I think it's cute.
3961480	3981480	My older brother says it makes me look subby. I don't know what subby means. I like sub. Yeah, I'll take you some time. I guess. She's not a date or anything. It's not a date.
3981480	3997480	Um, anyways, I think I'm done with typing. Can you, like, proofread this for me?
3997480	4013480	Come on. Sorry. My family is little hands. I don't know if you know this.

4098600	4100600	Okay
4101800	4106680	I guess I can rewrite this paragraph or maybe I should just make you do it
4106680	4109400	Since you want to be so bossy and just lay on my back
4112920	4114920	You know what I should do
4122920	4124920	I want you to stand up

4169720	4171720	And then
4172120	4176760	No, you you have really bad grammar. Why do you keep typing stuff wrong?
4178280	4180280	Are you like dumb or something?

4193640	4195640	Now keep going
4197080	4203160	Why did you type that doesn't make any sense? No, your syntax is all wrong. Don't move over. How much?
4206040	4208040	You have to type it like this
4210120	4214360	Like that that makes more sense. Okay, does that make more sense to you?
4217320	4219320	You're trying to get a rise out of me? You're getting distracted
4221320	4223800	What's distracting me? What's the matter?

5728040	5730040	Just because we hang out
5731480	5733480	One time doesn't mean
5734200	5736200	weird friends or

5759240	5761880	Oh, you've heard of my sister she's so weird
5762840	5768920	I'm not I I still like to think about it and I thought about it. I don't want to go out with you. You're weird
5774680	5776680	But I
5778200	5782600	Like I do need to keep you around to help me with my homework. So
5784200	5786200	You'll be my pet
5786360	5788120	Got it
5788120	5789800	I'll get you
5789800	5794360	A nice leash and I'll drag you around school with it
5796200	5799320	I think that's a good compromise, isn't it?
5807960	5811480	My head bigger. Oh, and I have a really big head
5816200	5818200	Let me get a little closer
5819880	5821880	You
5825960	5827960	Will you be my pet
5830120	5834520	My my aunt taught me this trick. Do you want to see a trick?
5836360	5838360	I have a leash
5839240	5841240	I know my hand doesn't match my body
5843160	5845880	But don't worry about that. I have a leash
5846440	5849960	So I always have one on hand
5851800	5853800	I'll tighten it when necessary
5856200	5858200	Okay
5858520	5865160	And then every time you see me in the homies you have to drop to your knees and you have to kiss my shoes
5866840	5868840	Got it
5869400	5871400	While you kiss my shoes
5876120	5879480	How do I have them? I just I don't know
5880280	5882280	I have it
5884760	5886760	So will you be my puppy?
5889400	5891400	I'll take care of you
5891960	5899320	I'll call you bad name and I'll take you for walking and maybe I'll let you sleep under my bed
5900200	5909560	Okay, do you want to have a sleepover? Maybe I'll let you sleep with me by my hand
5915640	5919080	And you can call me mistress, step up in me
5919080	5921080	And
5924040	5928360	Appropriate school? Well, it's only inappropriate if the teachers find out, isn't it?
5929240	5931880	But teachers don't have to find out anything, do they?
5934200	5936280	It will be our little secret, won't it?
5944440	5947240	Looks like you're already excited to get started
5949240	5955800	Should we practice some training?
5965240	5972120	What's wrong with your pants? They look like they're getting bigger. What's up with that?
5973080	5978920	Why does that keep happening? Are you hiding something in there? I want to see
5985160	5987160	I think you should show me what's going on
5989880	5991880	And once we take care of that problem
5994760	5996760	Then maybe we can get started
6002760	6004760	Hmm
6010360	6014200	It's your phone? Your phone is very warm
6016840	6019320	Hmm, I just want to
6019320	6021320	Uh
6023400	6031320	Nah, your phone's a weird shape. Are you sure? Are you hiding something from me?
6035400	6037880	You know, bunnies have very good noses
6038440	6040440	I
6044760	6049480	Think something in there is making me sneeze. I have to check it out
6055880	6060280	It's very smells stronger than you
6060280	6062280	Hmm
6067400	6069400	There's something about it that I like
6077880	6081160	All right, are you gonna show me or what?

7437560	7439560	So
7462360	7464360	Oh
7468120	7470120	I
7491080	7494200	Wait a second you smell really good
7498120	7500120	Oh
7522120	7524120	Wait a second
7525080	7527080	Did you use my shampoo
7530200	7534440	You used my body wash and my shampoo conditioner
7537000	7539000	My stuff is expensive
7540200	7542200	Hmm
7542600	7545080	Mom gets it special for me from bun fora
7546680	7548680	And banalta
7548760	7550760	Um
7554280	7556280	I guess that suits you
7558440	7560440	Having my smell
7562440	7568120	Pain completely enveloped in my smell
7574280	7576280	I guess you're not so bad
7579000	7585720	You didn't want to use my brother's a 7-in-1. Yeah, I don't know why you bought that
7585800	7589480	I think he got off some like black market website or something. He's weird
7590360	7592600	He likes to go on this place called um
7593880	7595880	uh
7597800	7601720	Six six tune I think I don't know
7603720	7606680	He's really secretive about it. He won't let me use this computer
7607240	7609880	I don't know what kind of stuff he has on there and I'm too scared to find out
7612360	7615320	You'll pay me back. You promise
7620600	7622600	You better
7636680	7642680	I'm trying to move on my body
7657800	7661560	Um, I guess um
7661560	7668840	Are we done with our project and studying?
7672680	7677400	When are we supposed to turn this in again?
7685240	7687240	Two weeks from now
7687480	7689240	Oh
7689240	7690920	Huh
7691000	7693000	I thought it was sooner than that
7694760	7701080	I guess you'll have to come over every day so we can focus on the project, right?
7706040	7708440	We still got so much research to do
7711880	7715080	And I still have to train you
7715160	7722360	To make sure you look the most perfect little puppy
7724520	7726520	I mean
7730520	7732520	We have to
7734200	7739400	reread some passages and um
7741480	7743480	Maybe
7744440	7747240	Do some extra research with each other
7749960	7752440	Next time you should
7753880	7758280	Bring your laptop so you can study on my bed
7759720	7761720	Open my books
7763240	7766120	And then you won't have to leave my bed ever
7769400	7772040	Yeah, does that sound good?
7774200	7776200	If we get an A
7778840	7781240	I'll give you a special present
7785960	7788440	Yeah extra research
7789560	7794680	There's still a lot but I don't know and I need you to show me
7798120	7800920	Just be nice when you do, okay
7803480	7805480	You
7833480	7835480	You
7845640	7848440	Separation go away
7863480	7870440	Did you have a good time studying with her I think I I think I think I could tell we had a good time
7893480	7895480	You
7923480	7925480	You
7932280	7937480	Oh, I was muted how does the new microphone all of the new mic from the go XLR sound
7940520	7942520	Muted muted muted
7945400	7950280	Are you listening uh, I was I was hanging out with my sister in the next room
7950440	7952440	You
7958040	7960040	Oh my goodness
7967800	7969800	Bit on
7971240	7974200	My nieces are very quirky they're very interesting people
7981000	7983560	Stop corrupting my knees
7987160	7989160	The sound is tinny
7996600	8000120	My sound effects were very very loud, okay good to know
8005320	8008360	Oh, okay, so was speaking on my good to know thank you
8011240	8017320	Again, I'm still trying to figure out the settings for these things. How does this sound tinny?
8022760	8025160	Maybe it's I don't know
8025160	8027160	Hmm
8035080	8036760	I
8036760	8041800	My my niece needs to see the world. I'm gonna there's lots of different people that come into the hotel
8041800	8044120	I have to show them what they'll she's what they're like
8048280	8051960	The mic peaks when you raise your voice, okay good to know thank you. Thank you
8055240	8060760	Yes, you know she's getting it stuck or I'm gonna have to call and step she I think they do have step sibling
8062360	8065880	Because I think I think her older brother is a step brother. I can't I can't recall
8067080	8069080	I'm not super close with my sister's kids
8071400	8075880	Every once in a while, um, I'll pick up shabbani and shabbathani
8078600	8082520	She wanted to be called mistress. Oh, I don't know where she got that from
8085480	8089880	What is causing the floating head syndrome with my outfits, um
8091080	8093080	So I'll show you actually
8093960	8098760	So what I use so these are booth booth assets that you see
8100200	8103800	So let's say I'll use this one for example the one I used for shabbani
8105000	8107000	So this is literally a little asset
8109480	8111240	And
8111240	8113240	you have to
8113560	8118120	Kind of click it but the physics sometimes can be a lot
8119480	8121480	And so what I have to do
8122520	8124520	because each time
8124600	8129320	I'm going to do a zero was showing me she made a toggle where it takes her head
8131640	8138200	Her I have to go through and make a toggle where I have to literally make everything transparent besides my neck
8138200	8144360	And head and hair and ears and they're like really my lower half
8145240	8147880	And then I need to make a toggle of that so I can do it a lot easier
8147880	8151720	So it sticks a little bit better as you can see when this is the asset
8152120	8155400	It sticks a lot better when my head is the asset in vtube studio
8155480	8160360	It doesn't stick as well, but I kind of like the charm of that the little like added lower, you know
8160360	8162360	Yeah
8166440	8170760	Yeah, so like I'll show you so this is the head
8172200	8176440	I it's imported and saved as a asset
8178520	8180520	In vtube studio
8180920	8182920	I don't save it as a model
8183080	8186440	Because then I would have to change my model each time and I don't want to do that
8187000	8189000	So you can see here. Oh look
8190520	8192520	There's two of me
8194520	8201560	Um if I put this on it clips over and so but it only will stick properly
8206840	8208840	You can see the physics
8208920	8210920	Get a little wonky with it
8211160	8216200	And I've dialed down all the physics. It's just how the I think it's just how it's rigged. Um
8217160	8223400	But yeah, you can see even when it's near pinned to my model it kind of floats around
8225240	8227240	I still have to figure that out
8231240	8234040	Yeah, that's how that works. That's a little behind the scenes
8236440	8238440	It kind of looks like my hair is behind
8239400	8241400	Ha
8245640	8247640	Oh
8252600	8257080	Should be three head strikes again a different kind of boing boing
8259720	8261720	Okay
8262680	8264680	Yeah, shivers I'll be telling you
8266840	8268840	Did you pin it to a wobbly piece of hair?
8269320	8272520	Honestly, it's hard to tell because I try to pin it to
8273560	8275560	like my chest area
8275720	8277720	Or my neck and it just doesn't
8278440	8284360	Want to stick I've even minimized my model really small to see if I could place the asset over it and kind of make it
8284440	8286440	More stable. It doesn't work either
8286600	8293800	Um, I know Serenity from me knew I was gonna help me with that any other girls with that so
8295880	8297880	Um, but let's see
8298440	8301960	I will see you guys later. I am super fucking tired
8303400	8305400	She's the perfect woman remember that
8310120	8314200	Why does this have a debut under it when it should have I had some more
8315080	8321240	Actually, I'll put 3dio ASMR seems to be like get godly
8334360	8336360	Working on a project
8345000	8349400	I did more of a project than studying because I forgot my own
8351320	8353320	The thing that came up with
8365080	8367080	Okay, let's see
8367960	8369960	Hmm
8371960	8374840	Probably anybody to raid so I guess I'll just end stream
8375480	8377960	Oh, I would read to emmy, but she's not here
8379000	8380840	so, you know
8380840	8383880	Go out and do what you must in the world
8385480	8388520	And I hope you had a good time. Is there a streams later?
8389880	8391720	I believe
8391720	8395640	So have a good one. I know I still need to watch the new boys EP. I'm gonna do that right now
8396600	8399960	I'm gonna turn off my 3dio. I hope you guys have a lovely night
8401000	8403000	um
8403640	8405640	I hope uh
8406440	8408440	You didn't read your bibles too hard
8409320	8416600	Uh, I will see you around. I'll see you tomorrow. We're gonna play 80s. I'm so excited. All right. Bye everyone
8417560	8419560	kisses
8425960	8427960	Kiss
