00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You

2
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You

3
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You

4
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You

5
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You

6
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You

7
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You

11
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
You

12
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You

13
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You

14
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You

15
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You

16
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You

17
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You

18
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You

19
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You

20
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You

21
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You

22
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You

23
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You

24
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You

25
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You

26
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You

27
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You

28
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:03,000
but I think it'll be extremely enjoyable for everybody involved, at least visually,

29
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:10,000
you know, at least visually. I'm making sure my webcam is in place and that everything

30
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:20,000
is good. I'm quite anxious to show you what I've come up with. It actually wasn't my

31
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:29,000
intention at all, but it literally, after I woke up, it just idea just popped into

32
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:39,000
my head about kind of how to raise the hand cam experience for the visual stuff and the

33
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:49,000
visual effects and so I think you guys will like it a lot. I'm super super super excited.

34
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I haven't tweeted yet, no, because I wanted to make sure I was good, but let me tweet

35
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:15,000
out that I'm live. Where is the tweet? Where did it go? Literally after I tweeted, it popped

36
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
into my head and I immediately tweeted it out and I immediately tweeted it out because

37
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I wanted to hold myself accountable that I would do it because I'm like this is such

38
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:34,000
a good idea, I have to. Like why? I can't try to be lazy and avoid doing it because I had

39
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:42,000
to go get stuff to do this. Please, if you guys have enjoyed this week and you're new

40
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,000
here but you haven't subscribed, please consider subscribing. I put a lot of effort into the

41
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:55,000
videos I make when they're hand cam based, so I would appreciate the support. And obviously

42
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
it doesn't have to be monetary, but I mean just like liking, commenting, subscribing.

43
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,000
There's a lot to help my channel, so I really appreciate it. I also know in advance I'm

44
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,000
going to be very, very quiet because I am far away from the mic and I'm whispering unless

45
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I come up super, super, super, super close to you, okay? So, you don't have to tell me

46
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I'm quiet. I know, thank you. I'm just saying that in advance. There was one more idea that

47
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I had, but I did not have time to put it into place, but I'll gladly tell you what it was

48
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:50,000
because it was part of the role play portion. You know how Mercy with her debut kind of

49
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:58,000
like captured you and like brought you and like you like woke up somewhere? Like I was

50
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:05,000
going to do something similar to that, but I would, I was going to show me like dragging

51
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:11,000
you in a bag and you like looking up and all the, all you see is just like kind of like

52
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
darkness and then like my circle is like a little circle of my face is a light and I'm

53
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:25,000
just looking down at you. And but I didn't, I didn't have time to put that together. Hold

54
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:34,000
on. Give me, give me, give me one. Yeah, I can always use it another time. I'm just very excited.

55
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Sorry if you can hear, you know, she's singing the song of her people in the bathroom, not

56
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,000
like in a litter box. I mean, like she just like stood me out a lot. Okay, give me one

57
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
second. I need to do one more thing. Rain is a familiar.

58
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Yeah.

59
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Okay, I apologize. I just wanted to make sure that Fio was okay before I started because

60
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I tend to get really into my ASMRs and I just want to make sure that she was nice and comfy

61
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:03,000
and good to go before I left her by her home some for an hour or two. These are all booth

62
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:11,000
assets except for my hat. I will, after I'm done the stream, I will credit what I've used

63
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:17,000
today in the description. So you guys can find it if you are wanting to use some of the

64
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:25,000
assets for Halloween yourself. I'm out of breath because I just ran around my house.

65
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I also have some background sound. I have some storms. Please let me know if you think

66
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:39,000
that is okay. If you want to hear the storms or if it is too loud or if you would just

67
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:55,000
prefer the ambiance of simply me talking. I personally love storm backgrounds myself,

68
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:06,000
yes, as well. So let me know. Storm is cozy. Is it too loud or anything? Please do let me

69
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:19,000
know if it is too loud. Cozy, yeah. Alright, everybody seems pretty pleased with it. Alright,

70
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:32,000
cool. So I have some visual triggers prepared for you today. I might be actually too eager

71
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:39,000
to save the best for last because I just really want to show you guys what I've done. I'm pretty

72
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:47,000
proud of it. You thought the bowl with the water and the beads were good, but I got more

73
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:57,000
stuff for you. I have more on top of that. But yeah.

74
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:13,000
With super level of it. But yes, I'm very excited. I worked hard in the process. I'll give you a hint.

75
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I've accidentally made, I turned water into a different form when I didn't mean to. There

76
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
might be a little bit of a science aspect to all of this which is going to be pretty fun

77
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:32,000
and neat. So I hope you guys will enjoy. I work really, really hard for you guys. I really do

78
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:39,000
because I really want to elevate my content and make stuff enjoyable. So I'm very proud

79
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:49,000
of what I've put together today. Yes, I'm Jesus. I have turned water into wine. It is true. It is,

80
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:58,000
all you've heard, it is real. Okay, I'm going to come up a little bit closer to you. Just a little bit

81
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:17,000
closer. Hi. I'm a little red. Let me just, there we go. Hi. Oh, Boomi's already here. Can you move,

82
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:27,000
sir? You need to leave. What are you scared of? There's nothing there. He's scared of my shoe. You

83
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:36,000
know, he's a special kind of guy, to be honest with you. Raina's in the litter box next to

84
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:47,000
me so I'm waiting for her to finish. Mam, are you done? Boomi, what are you scared of? Oh, you're

85
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
scared of my, well, you know, I'm actually good, I'm happy that you're scared of that

86
00:21:51,000 --> 00:22:02,000
but I don't want you touching it. My part of the surprise, he is scared of. Raina, are you done? Mam,

87
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:15,000
that litter is not on the side of the thing. Well, you got some ASMR from Raina, from Raina in the

88
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
litter box.

89
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Actually, I drank a drink that was left over. I thought it was new. It was not. It was a drink I

90
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:18,000
looked out for a bit. That's not good. Don't worry, it's fine. Don't worry, I'm okay. Got my

91
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:27,000
spooky cat. Also, before we start, I have to show you something because I'm very mad. I'm

92
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:35,000
extremely frustrated. Hold on. I'm going to switch over to the hand cam really quickly.

93
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Okay.

94
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Okay.

95
00:24:49,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Well, you can guess what I was saying, right? That I hate them. Did you see how ugly it was? Can you believe that? I know I was

96
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:10,000
muted. I could see that I was muted. Can you believe how ugly that thing was? That was an ugly baby. That one's

97
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:26,000
dying. That one's dying. He's not cute. He's so ugly. Why does he look like that? Why do all of my

98
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:43,000
children look ugly? I'm going to blame you. Anyways, so Raina's finally exited the litter box. So now I will

99
00:25:43,000 --> 00:26:12,000
start the ASMR, okay? Alright. Okay.

100
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Oh. Finally, you've woken up. You're probably wondering where you are, aren't you? It must be pretty weird

101
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:58,000
being in an unfamiliar place and waking up not knowing where you are. Who might I be, you ask? Don't worry about it. You

102
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:09,000
know, if I revealed my name to you, then you might have some sort of power over me. You don't really remember

103
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:34,000
anything, do you? You're in my realm now. You walked right into my trap. You really can't remember

104
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:50,000
anything. Not even how you wandered into my woods late at night. The dead of night. Not a star in the sky, the moon

105
00:27:50,000 --> 00:28:11,000
could not be seen. Dark clouds hovering overhead. You don't remember the fog curling around your

106
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:31,000
ankles, working its way up your body, wrapping around your legs, reaching up, up, up, lingering

107
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:46,000
around your torso and enveloping you completely. You don't remember as you wander deeper into

108
00:28:46,000 --> 00:29:06,000
the forest. Your eyes obscured. You don't see or call seeing my form in the distance. This

109
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:25,000
light shadow pulling you closer and closer, lowering you closer and closer into my embrace.

110
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:49,000
You don't remember the way the fog took over you completely and swallowed you whole. You don't remember, do you?

111
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:24,000
What am I? Of course a mere mortal would wonder these things. I'm a witch, of course. And it's your lucky day. You, my sweet mortal.

112
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Get to become my pet. I haven't had a mortal captive in so, so long. They're so fun to toy with. But so easily broken.

113
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:53,000
So, it looks like you'll be my new pet.

114
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Oh, you want to know what happened to the last one, do you?

115
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Well, let's say they didn't quite survive the night. You may call me Mistress, for I am your master of sorts. You'll be staying with me for the time being.

116
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:58,000
And I will be doing experiments on you. My sweet, tasty mortal. Maybe I should call you more slowly. I could just eat you.

117
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:17,000
What kind of experiments? Well, that would ruin the fun, wouldn't it?

118
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:38,000
But first, let me get you out of these chains. Have you even noticed that they were there? You probably didn't. You seem pretty daft for a human.

119
00:32:47,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Do you think you're good enough?

120
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:44,000
To come out of your chains? Maybe. If you begged. I can be quite merciful when I want to. But only if you beg. Go on. Don't want a pet's beg. Be a good pet.

121
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:57,000
And do as you're told.

122
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Obey me. Obey me. Obey. Obey.

123
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Well, you obey. Fine.

124
00:34:37,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I have you bound quite tightly. I apologize. It seems like some of these chains will leave a mark. Perhaps it bruised.

125
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:33,000
It is what you deserve. You are nothing but your mortal, insignificant, unnecessary.

126
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:53,000
A waste of space. Powerless. I don't even know how your kind lasted so long.

127
00:35:53,000 --> 00:36:12,000
You're nothing compared to my power, as you'll soon find out. I'm very tempted to make a meal out of you. You do work quite scrumptious.

128
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:50,000
So many chains. I got a little carried away. Honestly, I didn't need to tie you up at all, but I get bored sometimes. I like to add a little bit of spice when I play with my toys.

129
00:36:51,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Please beg more. You know, I haven't had human in quite a bit. It is fun to hear you're pleased to not be eaten.

130
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
But there's much I have to do before that.

131
00:37:37,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Come here. Now that you're freed, I will allow you to look around so you may look at your predicament.

132
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I have placed you near my cauldron. I think I'll be doing some experiments on you. Some will be pleasant, maybe. Some will be terrifyingly painful.

133
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:40,000
But the fun part is, you get to pick, but you don't know what does what.

134
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Oh, how fun, how fun indeed. Isn't it so fun? Isn't it just grand?

135
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Alright, let me move you a little bit so that you can see what's going on around you.

136
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow. Let me move myself to the side, just so you get a general idea.

137
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Don't worry about the eyeballs. You don't have to ask where they came from. It is of no bother to you.

138
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:09,000
But this isn't when I'm going to show you. Let me move first to the side.

139
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:28,000
But welcome. You'll soon be ending up in this pond. The eyeballs have petrified. I think they sound quite nice, don't you?

140
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Alright, let me move you a little bit so that you can see what's going on around you.

141
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Wow, wow, wow.

142
00:40:52,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Alright, let me fix some bad eyes for a human. Don't you? Ooh, can I make it purple? That's fun.

143
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Huh, seems like I can't fix the greeniness. It is what it is. Oh, unless I just do that.

144
00:41:49,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Can I change the color? I want to make it purple.

145
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:17,000
What about the other one? Yeah, purple. Oh, ooh. I know what to do with some of the east.

146
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Look at which is the west of the east.

147
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:34,000
My nails are really cool.

148
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Let's listen to some petrified eyeballs showing.

149
00:43:34,000 --> 00:44:03,000
You're falling deeper under my spell, aren't you? You don't even know it. I'm just pulling you closer.

150
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Deeper and deeper and deeper.

151
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:47,000
But anyways, let's move forward.

152
00:44:47,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Sorry, I just had to run to my itchy pantry to grab some items.

153
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I love to do that.

154
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I have some items here.

155
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:55,000
I even have my spell book. And you'll get to choose the spells.

156
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Lots of different spells to go through.

157
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:23,000
And my extremely fancy and not branded grimoire.

158
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:42,000
What should I do to you first?

159
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:58,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

160
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Pick a number 1 through 11.

161
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:28,000
It's so funny that you thought you had a choice. I get to pick you silly freaking goose.

162
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Anyways, let's see.

163
00:47:33,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Hold on, the ghosts in my castle are being quite noisy. Give me just a moment.

164
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Oh yes, I found it. The spell to draw out your blood from your body. This is a good spell. Very, very good spell.

165
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:32,000
I might need to grab some more items.

166
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:52,000
I need some moonlight dust.

167
00:48:52,000 --> 00:49:19,000
The grimoire requires 4 spoonfuls.

168
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Don't worry, I'll keep you alive with my powers while I drain your blood. You'll feel a little bit of pain, but not too much. You'll still stay conscious.

169
00:49:47,000 --> 00:50:05,000
I'm totally not using my teeth to open this.

170
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Let's see. 4 spoonfuls of moonlight dust.

171
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:51,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4.

172
00:50:51,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Let's put you over here.

173
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:26,000
I almost forgot the twilight nectar.

174
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Wait, no, I can't do that one. I have other methods to remove your blood.

175
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Don't look at the titles. That's a lie.

176
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:41,000
This might be a little painful, but I'm not sorry.

177
00:52:41,000 --> 00:53:02,000
I need water from my magic fountain, which you can probably hear in the distance.

178
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:16,000
I can't read. These rooms are unusual. What is a fluid ounce? Who knows, truly.

179
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Don't worry about that. The hobbits are being silly again.

180
00:54:38,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Sorry, it's taken quite some time to measure this out. Very unusual rooms.

181
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Milliliters? No idea what that is.

182
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Perfect. I think I got it just right. No, you cannot have any of my magic fountain water. It is not for human consumption.

183
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Why is it salty? I probably shouldn't eat that. What can I spit this out?

184
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Don't worry about it.

185
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:36,000
It looks like spray. I don't know what you're talking about.

186
00:56:37,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Where is my rose elixir? I need six drops of the rose elixir.

187
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:26,000
I need scissors. Who needs scissors when you have teeth? Me, because this isn't working.

188
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:48,000
This wasn't a part of my initial idea. I saw it at the store and I wanted to do it.

189
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven

190
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:34,000
I'm not a dork

191
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:25,000
uh huh, yes, indeed, actually I gotta get some unicorn piss, I mean gold

192
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:52,000
it's fresh, I milked it myself

193
00:59:52,000 --> 01:00:14,000
I didn't check to see how much I was supposed to go with

194
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:30,000
there we go

195
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
might have spilled a little

196
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:36,000
I don't know why I thought you guys would be able to see this in my really bad webcam

197
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
don't worry about it

198
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
it looks nice

199
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,000
anyways I've drawn the blood from your body

200
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:59,000
now I will drink it

201
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:05,000
quite good

202
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
delicious, even, I'm spilling it everywhere

203
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
don't worry about it

204
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,000
now that you're bloodless, I can move forward with the neck

205
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:27,000
with the neck part of the ritual

206
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:32,000
you're pretty

207
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:52,000
well that's kind of sparklier, do you have some fey in you?

208
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:57,000
sorry, I had to go into my infernal dishwasher

209
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:04,000
so I can get a bowl to dump stuff into

210
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:08,000
anyways, next

211
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:12,000
now I must remove the bones from your body

212
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:19,000
this might take a little bit more

213
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,000
the bones from your body

214
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:31,000
they will appear in my cauldron

215
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:40,000
I need some fairy breeze

216
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,000
you got all of your bones

217
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,000
even the one that you think is not a bone

218
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
actually is

219
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:53,000
what do they call it then?

220
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,000
let's see

221
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:04,000
fairy breeze

222
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:11,000
four spoonfuls

223
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:30,000
and it mixes up like this

224
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:49,000
one, two, three, four

225
01:03:49,000 --> 01:04:13,000
and then I need to pour in some more of my mystical fountain water

226
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:29,000
I will create my own slime army

227
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:35,000
and we shall pour this in

228
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,000
fabulous

229
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:46,000
they're being drawn to the cauldron

230
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
take the bones

231
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:52,000
boil, boil, take their bones

232
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,000
liquefy them and put them in my cauldron

233
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:07,000
remove them, remove them, remove them

234
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:19,000
need a little bit more fairy breeze

235
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:36,000
and I have liquefied your bones

236
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:47,000
that's awkward

237
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:52,000
I think that's what I'm gonna try to do

238
01:05:52,000 --> 01:06:09,000
quite nice actually

239
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:25,000
your bones are fun to play with

240
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:36,000
how does that make you feel?

241
01:06:36,000 --> 01:07:01,000
I can put your bones against your ears and you can't do anything about it because you're melting

242
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,000
how does it feel to get your bone taken?

243
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,000
here I'll make it into a bone again for you

244
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:14,000
I'll make it into a bone

245
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:22,000
looks like a bone

246
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:29,000
yeah

247
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:36,000
yippee

248
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,000
that exploded

249
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:46,000
sorry there's some more bone in there

250
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:50,000
I need some unholy napkins

251
01:07:50,000 --> 01:08:04,000
that's what this machine needs

252
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:08,000
alright now that I've removed your bones and blood

253
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:23,000
we go on to the next

254
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:39,000
I took your life for me

255
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:47,000
I'm going to take your emotions

256
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:50,000
you'll be able to feel nothing anymore

257
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
except for feet

258
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
nothing but emotions

259
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,000
I need some forest rain

260
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:02,000
here it is

261
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
forest rain

262
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:08,000
it's important for, I should probably wash this out

263
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:14,000
yeah

264
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
that's good

265
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:23,000
ooh

266
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
you will become a blob

267
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
you will become my slime

268
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
you'll become part of my slime army

269
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
unless you look tasty

270
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:38,000
because then I'll just eat you

271
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
okay

272
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
I need

273
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:48,000
what is it

274
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:56,000
ten milliseconds of forest rain

275
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:06,000
let's see

276
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
perfect

277
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:14,000
pour that on in there

278
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:19,000
get in

279
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:23,000
just a little bit

280
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
there a little extra

281
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:29,000
I need a drop of star shine

282
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:34,000
don't ask me where I got the star shine from

283
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:46,000
alright

284
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:52,000
you know what my favorite kind of sandwich is

285
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:58,000
you might think it's a sandwich

286
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:03,000
but it's a sub

287
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:10,000
a drop of star shine

288
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:17,000
I'm using my familiars clippers

289
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:22,000
a drop of star shine

290
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
that's a little more than a drop it's fine

291
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:29,000
I need a little drop of sky blue

292
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:36,000
what is sky blue at

293
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:54,000
hmm

294
01:11:54,000 --> 01:12:04,000
can I zoom in

295
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:08,000
because you guys are little scaredy cats

296
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:17,000
and you like to hide away

297
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:21,000
whoa

298
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
wow

299
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:28,000
I was so much zoom

300
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,000
so much zoom

301
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
alright then

302
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:38,000
we need mermaids spray

303
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:41,000
I'm gonna eyeball this

304
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
wait the

305
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:48,000
oh wait the capsule on

306
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:54,000
mermaids spray

307
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:59,000
sucking the emotions from your body

308
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:04,000
so that only fear remains

309
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:09,000
hope is gone

310
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
mermaids spray

311
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:16,000
what's wrong with mermaids spray

312
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:29,000
hmm

313
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:36,000
get out

314
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:44,000
oh some of you are green with envy

315
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:54,000
oh

316
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
looks like I've gotten some sadness

317
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
and some happiness here

318
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:05,000
mostly a lot of jealousy

319
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:14,000
let's do it else I can draw out

320
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:24,000
gotta make sure I put the caps back on things

321
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,000
hmm

322
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:28,000
looks like there's a little bit of rage and love

323
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,000
oh it looks like more blood

324
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,000
interesting

325
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
tell me what do you see

326
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:39,000
oh there's a great darkness within you

327
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:46,000
good I like that

328
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,000
oh

329
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
um

330
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,000
well

331
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,000
I discovered something

332
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
it uh

333
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
it does that

334
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,000
and I think I can

335
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
I can pop it

336
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:12,000
oh

337
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,000
this is quite nice to touch

338
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:19,000
your emotions are fun to play with

339
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:26,000
that sounds funny

340
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:45,000
oh it did pop

341
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
well

342
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:50,000
that's what's left of you

343
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:54,000
emotions are like puddy in my hand

344
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:59,000
where did my unholy napkin go

345
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:02,000
I had it I don't know where it went

346
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:06,000
now my hands are covered in your sad emotions

347
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:10,000
I found it

348
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
oh my gosh

349
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:29,000
this is a lie

350
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,000
alright

351
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
and now

352
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:35,000
I have to make you fall in love with me

353
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,000
so you'll do whatever I ask

354
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:42,000
even if that means going to your death

355
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:49,000
let me find the spell for that

356
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:56,000
the only emotion that will be left

357
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:17,000
is your obsession for me

358
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:20,000
am I out of dragon drops

359
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:24,000
oh

360
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:32,000
perfect

361
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:35,000
let's do it in here

362
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:44,000
I need a little bit of mermaid spray for this one

363
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:49,000
the only thing that will be left is your devotion for me

364
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
how does that make you feel

365
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:56,000
how does that make me love that my wings

366
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:01,000
25 milliliters

367
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:11,000
it opens better

368
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:20,000
perfect

369
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:28,000
I need some extra of the rose

370
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:33,000
that's the two drops it's fine

371
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:40,000
they won't know it

372
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,000
they really really won't

373
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:49,000
and now

374
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:56,000
let's see a little bit more

375
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:01,000
it looks like wine

376
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:09,000
and then

377
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:28,000
what is it

378
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:34,000
what is it

379
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:38,000
oh

380
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:42,000
perfect

381
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:46,000
I need one more thing

382
01:19:46,000 --> 01:20:02,000
bubbles are rising in it

383
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:09,000
let's see what I can take out

384
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:12,000
oh it's just some of your organs

385
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:16,000
oh that's awkward

386
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:21,000
it's almost like spaghetti

387
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
I forgot about these

388
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
I forgot you guys

389
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:28,000
I have little organs

390
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:32,000
that would be quite interesting

391
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,000
and I think these are your veins

392
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:38,000
that makes sense

393
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,000
let me just pluck those over there

394
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
oh is that the heart

395
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
nope that's not it

396
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:49,000
that's not what I'm looking for

397
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:57,000
and ooh

398
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:02,000
oh here's the heart

399
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:11,000
hold on

400
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
that looks like a heart

401
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:19,000
what do you think

402
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
you want a bite

403
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
I'm going to eat your own heart

404
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
I'll put it in my hand for you

405
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:34,000
so you can see your heart

406
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:38,000
I'm going to crush it

407
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:45,000
it's very squishy

408
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:50,000
I'll save that for later

409
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,000
I'll eat that

410
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:58,000
this is turning green

411
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:04,000
this is changing a lot of colors

412
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:08,000
I also might have someone shuck in the process

413
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:12,000
don't worry about that

414
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:17,000
perfect

415
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:21,000
I'm going to get some more now

416
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
I'm actually going to towel

417
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
an unholy towel

418
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,000
towel, towel, towel

419
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:49,000
I'm going to wipe off all this mess I've made

420
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
let's see

421
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,000
is there anything else that I was missing

422
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:20,000
fabulous

423
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:21,000
alright

424
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:24,000
for the peace there is a stops

425
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:27,000
I have some magic crystals

426
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:40,000
that I will use to finalize

427
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
your love for me

428
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,000
and your obsession and devotion

429
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:49,000
where will this eat you

430
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:52,000
we'll see how this goes

431
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
come closer child

432
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
come closer mortal

433
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:19,000
I need more water

434
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:52,000
where did my special mixing spoon go

435
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,000
family

436
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
I need even more

437
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:20,000
more water minions

438
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:23,000
more water

439
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:48,000
I think this ASMR was just more of an excuse for me to be able to do more fun stuff

440
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
more water

441
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
honestly the latter half of this stream

442
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:17,000
I will probably cut with the first portion of the stream

443
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
and push them together

444
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:22,000
because those are really the only ASMR part

445
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:35,000
you must drink the soup

446
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:38,000
of the eyeballs

447
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:42,000
so you know what I'm going to put you right over here

448
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:45,000
yeah that's better

449
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:48,000
now I'm nice and close to you

450
01:26:52,000 --> 01:27:02,000
I almost forgot this special ingredient

451
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
boy

452
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
boy

453
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
boy

454
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
boy

455
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:06,000
the soup is coming along quite nicely don't you think

456
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
hmm

457
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
let's see

458
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
I got the

459
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
I got the

460
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
the

461
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
the

462
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
the

463
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
into the fog once more

464
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
you

465
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
you

466
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
you

467
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
you

468
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
you

469
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
you

470
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
you

471
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
you

472
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Let yourself go to the mist. Give yourself to me, human.

473
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:32,000
You have no match for me more, though.

474
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:42,000
The fog will pull you in, and you will become one with it.

475
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:50,000
A bodyless being wandering hopelessly for eternity.

476
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:22,000
You are under my spell. You are completely hypnotized.

477
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Forever serving me.

478
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:08,000
Forever serving me in this stress.

479
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:50,000

Don't worry, I know my craft.

Forever serving me in this stress.

489
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:16,000
You have entered a higher plane of existence. Now you're worth something.

490
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:44,000
Maybe I won't need you after all.

491
01:37:46,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Forever serving me in this stress.

492
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:26,000

Live and love me for all eternity.

501
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Falling deeper and deeper under my spell.

502
01:41:44,000 --> 01:42:10,000
Becoming obsessed and utterly devoted with the heavy rotation of this spell.

503

Becoming obsessed and utterly devoted with the heavy rotation of this spell.
