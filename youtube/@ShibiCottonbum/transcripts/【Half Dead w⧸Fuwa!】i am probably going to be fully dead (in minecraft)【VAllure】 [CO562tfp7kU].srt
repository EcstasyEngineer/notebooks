1
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You

2
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You

3
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You

4
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You

5
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,200
You

6
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,800
Just stairs

7
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,620
Hello, hi everybody who is still muted

8
00:04:54,940 --> 00:05:00,180
She'll undefinite a moment

9
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:10,380
Hi, hi, I just discovered while I was trying to set up stream that my phone isn't charging. So that's that's great

10
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,500
It's at 20% so if I die

11
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:19,900
Suddenly halfway through and stop moving. I might have to turn into Muppet mode. I

12
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,780
Don't know

13
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,940
Why isn't my phone charging? Let me try another charger

14
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:34,440
Hello, hello, oh, you can't hear Fuwa because she's deafened and muted. I'm in a message

15
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,100
I'm good

16
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,860
She's still talking to her chat

17
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:58,900
I use the six foot cord will it work still not long enough to reach

18
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,860
Okay, this is working it must be the cable

19
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,420
Don't don't ask why I suddenly had a hamster in my arms

20
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,100
I'll probably stream on the weekends

21
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:34,180
Wait, is it my desk isn't plugged in it does that make sense when I say that my desk isn't plugged in

22
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,020
I don't know why stuff keeps coming

23
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,780
Oh

24
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:07,340
There she is I was like one day she'll show on mute

25
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,220
All right, I'm good now

26
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,220
Hello, hello

27
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:22,060
How do you how should should I introduce myself to your stream?

28
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,860
And that would be amazing. I love that. I

29
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,060
Just I never introduced myself. Nobody ever knows gets to know who I am

30
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,300
Hi

31
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:40,300
Hi, my name is she be cotton bum a violers gen one indulge

32
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:46,180
And I am your favorite girl failure Dom and I like to do wacky voices and dress up

33
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,820
And do ASMR

34
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,740
Voice range from what I've seen actually it's kind of crazy

35
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:01,100
I wonder if I could do your voice. I bet if I tried hard enough. I might be able to do yours

36
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:14,380
I can't do your accent though. That's like my accent. I can't do oh

37
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:20,220
Yeah, I have a weird like hybrid Australian American accent because it's being online chronically

38
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,220
I

39
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:40,300
It's like I can I can retire guys you guys can you guys can have her instead. I

40
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:45,020
Just she just puppeteers the model and I just speak for her. Oh my gosh

41
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,980
I

42
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:53,660
Anybody's ever done that like a vtuber just moves the model and somebody else

43
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,580
Is because I'm an australian there would be massive like delay

44
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,060
Would be like yeah, hi

45
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:24,460
Am I actually a skinwalker? Yes. All right, you introduce yourself to my stream. Oh, yeah, right. That's that's true. Okay. Um

46
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,660
gosh

47
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,820
Okay, uh

48
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:35,820
I'm no good instructions. Um, hello. I am full. Uh, I am

49
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,820
I am full

50
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,620
Okay, that part

51
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,580
Should shut up. I already found you

52
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,340
I need a feed mine

53
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:53,820
I'm gonna feed mine while you introduce yourself. Um, okay. Okay. Okay. I am full

54
00:09:54,300 --> 00:10:00,620
Uh, I am predominantly a twitch streamer. Um, uh, but I do stream on youtube sometimes and I'm

55
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:05,420
I'm like, I'm kind of it in between at the moment, but I never do dual streams streams at the same time

56
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,500
I also said I almost did swings

57
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:13,020
Um, uh, I am an artist. I drew my model as well as most of the stuff that I use

58
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:17,980
What that's crazy. I do I do I do whatever the heck I want. I don't know. I just mess around to have fun

59
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:22,460
I can I do whatever I'm okay with anything. I do a lot on stream music, uh

60
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:26,380
Like whatever I kind of feel like on the day and I'm not scared to do anything

61
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:31,180
I've even done like IRL walk around streams and stuff like when I visited japan once so

62
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:35,260
I'm kind of cool with that kind of anything. I just like doing stuff. I love streaming

63
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,740
Unchonically online, please help

64
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:44,300
That's awesome. Wow you guys you have a very multi talented. Oh, she over here my god

65
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:52,060
Very impressive. I had no idea that you made your model and a lot of your assets. That's super super cool

66
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,220
I wish I could draw I can't

67
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,820
My audience is nice at any point. Yes, very true very very true

68
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,620
My chat is very happy to see you

69
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,500
Oh my gosh, that would be so fun

70
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:10,860
Let me pull up your are you straight? You're are you dual streaming on twitch and youtube right now? You said no

71
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,860
No, I never do dual streams. Um

72
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:17,820
I just kind of like uh, how might put it like I do one or the other

73
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:21,580
Because I I I don't have the attention span to dual stream

74
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,820
I feel that

75
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:30,300
I feel that for real. I think I would I would like die. I can't I can barely pay attention to myself and stream

76
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,260
And what I'm doing

77
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:37,260
I'm gonna I'm gonna pull up your chat so I can see your chat as well

78
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:46,540
That's a good idea. I want to do that. I want to do that as well. How do I just kidding it saying that I can't

79
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,180
See it. Wait. No, I can't see it

80
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,820
well

81
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,060
Because I don't I don't have a login to

82
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,780
for twitch on my

83
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:04,140
I'm like hey manager. Um, when am I gonna get twitch access so I can like talk to people

84
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:07,100
On twitch and they're just like, I don't know

85
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:14,620
So I just work feelers mostly like youtube, but yeah, they think that they would ever consider like

86
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,980
Like uh

87
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:24,700
Like giving it I guess a goal to let people kind of do both if they want to I guess I want to be surprised well for um

88
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:30,940
It's easier when you're in a agency to like pay out your talents on youtube

89
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,340
Um, that's true

90
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:39,420
And I honestly that's pretty much one of the only reasons besides uh, twitch also being kind of like

91
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,380
Band happy, but um, yeah

92
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:47,180
They take a bigger cut as well. That's true in an agency that's already like

93
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:51,740
Having to do extra finances having to be like, yeah, they're taking 50% as well. So

94
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,020
Twitch twitch likes to take money from people

95
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:59,740
You know, yep as a former twitch streamer. I totally agree with you

96
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,860
Let me pin your stuff in my chat

97
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:09,740
Yeah, I can I can see I can see your chat now too. Tell fool. We say hi. I can see you. I can see you

98
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:14,140
She can see you. She's walking. I can read. I can see the hi myself. Hello

99
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,220
I love you almost as well

100
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,500
You're very goofy

101
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:27,180
I like that though. I like goofy and gremlin. That's that's kind of my thing

102
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,500
You came to the right place too closely. I'm staring

103
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:37,020
Oh, I'm gonna ignore my travel. You think I'm just gonna read your channel. You guys are cooler. I'm kidding. Oh

104
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,820
Oh my god

105
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,380
Just totally abandoned church

106
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm just kidding guys. I'm joking

107
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,400
No, don't leave

108
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:55,280
Why is apple tv trying to make me sign up for twitch so I can get free apple tv?

109
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,600
Oh, that's like a promotion they're doing at the moment. You can just write it

110
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,040
There's like a dismiss button on it. I know I'm like pressing a bunch of buttons and it keeps popping up

111
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,600
All right. Now I can see

112
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,240
They're gonna leave and go to my street

113
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,100
Sheba, who is sheba? I'm she be

114
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,640
Oh, you have a seimi's cat

115

00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:25,200
Oh, that's that's tama. He's actually a ragdoll. He's a ragdoll

117
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,200
I have a cat cam up on my stream. Um pretty often as well

118
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,920
Oh my gosh, like uh on my normal layout. I have like a permanent cat cam in the corner

119
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,960
So you see my cats that pretty often which is why they've got a lot of the molds

120
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:42,720
I can send you a photo of them actually. I'm not leaving any photo of them. You've seen my cats. Please show me yours

121
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,880
Yeah, I love seeing your cats on your stream as well because they do cat cam too as well

122
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,960
Yeah, yeah, I like having a little cat cam

123
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,400
It's fun

124
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,560
It's a little it's a little level of um

125
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,360
kind of just like

126
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,440
Uh interaction with viewers

127
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,360
Yeah, and then sometimes I'll like give them traits to bait them to the camera

128
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,360
All right, look at the camera look at it goofy

129
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,600
Here's some goofy pictures of them first. I'm so excited. So here's tama

You know what I I respect you for that

145
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,560
It takes a special kind of lady

146
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,280
To have a hundred figures and a hundred plushies

147
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,200
You know I need my wife who is you know. Yeah, I get that

148
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,760
Wait, okay, so what's this game about?

149
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:32,960
Uh, it's like it's a puzzle game. Um, oh no like portal and stuff like that. Okay

150
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:39,040
It's kind of like that but you die more and it's really scuffed and it's really funny

151
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,280
Okay, perfect

152
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,680
I didn't look at anything about this game. You're like, let's play half dead. I'm like bet buys it

153
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,120
I mean, it's really it's really cheap as well. So that's why I really like it. Okay

154
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,120
I think for the money you get you get well more than like two bucks worth of entertainment

155
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,640
There's a new newer picture of combat. He's fat now. Let me see

156

Oh, yeah, it's because it doubled up. Let me put a space between

163
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,640
La la la la

164
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,080
But the game is pretty simple. I think you'll find it's really funny once we get going

165
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,520
Uh, and it's it's kind of a dead game. So there's like no servers. I mean, there's no

166
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,160
No one's playing this at the moment. I think except us. It's just us. Oh, perfect

167
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,040
All to ourselves

168
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,360
Put a bunch of spaces in between everything so I could be clicked on

169
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,040
Okay, now we're good. I'm just spamming you in my chat

170
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,160
Thank you for the hindry

171
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,120
Yes, I'm just setting up the uh

172
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:32,480
The the map lobby thingy. Okay the game is I'll explain more once we're in game and I can like show you stuff though

173
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,800
Oh, I just want to make sure it's like pretty easy

174
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,760
I do that on easy difficulty to start with

175
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,720
There's a harder difficulty

176
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:48,880
Yeah, it goes up to really hard. I think that it's kind of it's like a mix between like doing little puzzles

177
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,960
And it's kind of like I think like

178
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,640
Imagine mind sweeper, but you're like going through each room to see if the room is possible to pass through I guess

179
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,880
Okay, it's something about escaping. I think there's a movie

180
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,240
That this game was based on it's like people in squares and they go through each square trying to escape

181
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,400
But like it's like a horror movie. Oh

182
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,440
But this is not really scary. I think it's like a better horizon, but no, that's not that

183
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,320
Uh

184
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,960
No, it's not that. Um, it's kind of like saw

185
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,160
Oh, okay

186
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:29,120
Based on it's just like people dying mostly and then it's kind of like a survival game kind of thing. All right

187
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:34,560
Uh, I I'm so sorry in advance. I am terrible at puzzles

188
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:41,280
On the lie, I'm I'm garbage as well. So like we can it can just it'll be it's okay because it's funny

189
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,520
It's funny if you're both bad

190
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,360
Okay, perfect. You guys are gonna get a lot of laughs today. I hope you enjoy

191
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,520
Okay, you shouldn't see my if you're gonna multiplayer you should see mine in the servers

192
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,840
Uh, I think the password should be this

193
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,960
It literally says only one person online

194
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,640
That's me

195
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,520
Yeah, not all people play this

196
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,920
Uh, I should see once you're joined and I can start it. I can't see you. It's not popping up

197
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:18,800
Um, let me put it in Europe. Maybe if I wait, I'll shoot maybe it automatically put me in a different server

198
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,400
I didn't think about that

199
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,360
There's three people alive in Europe alive. Um

200
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,680
Let me see trying to find you there you are

201
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,960
I found you

202
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:37,360
Which one didn't set it to Australia Australia, uh, I didn't even real they didn't even realize Australia was an option

203
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:46,080
All right, so me send me the password games. Oh you already sent it to me. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I type in all people see okay

204
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,080
No, they won't

205
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,560
Whoa

206
00:20:54,560 --> 00:21:00,640
Hey, there you go. Okay. I can check I'll start it time to check on the room. Oh, I'm the max about actually

207
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,400
Okay, um

208
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:13,680
I'll do it in standard no time limit. Yeah, that's better actually no time limits better

209
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:18,000
Okay, so our eject objective is going to be to like to get to the escape

210
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,120
Five by five, okay

211
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,720
All right, I have like no game sound for some reason

212
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,520
Yeah, I really

213
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,480
Uh, go for it. Take time to see if we can

214
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,840
Let me see if I can meet it on desktop. Did you know maybe well, maybe it accidentally did it

215
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,360
To do to do

216
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,560
Open volume mixer

217
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,400
What the heck it is it doesn't even show that it exists in the mixer

218
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,640
What's happening it might have to do the thing where I wear two headphones at the same time

219
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,640
Well

220
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,080
I mean

221
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,080
I'm sure to remember the audio is important

222
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,280
Yeah, all about the immersion

223
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:21,680
Uh, I think there's like some rooms we have to listen to a timer or something, but I think it's fine

224
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,320
Okay, I also admit I haven't laid this in like over 10 years. So I'll also after him

225
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,200
Wait say something

226
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,640
It's only doing the game audio

227
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,680
Uno momento

228
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,480
Wait say something

229
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,600
Uh testing hello. Oh yay. Okay

230
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,040
Switching headphones, yes

231
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:16,720
I'll keep making in-game noises so you can make sure you can hear it

232
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,280
She's just quiet. Okay, I'll turn her up then

233
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,080
One more time

234
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,960
Perfect

235
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,560
I'm not the loudest as well

236
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,200
Now we're now we're ready to rumble. Let's go again

237
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,400
Why am I so short looking why am I looking at your chest

238
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:00,640
The camera for these models is in like this circle on your on the chest for some reason

239
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,440
So I'm also looking up at you. That's so

240
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,320
Oh, that's not even the most scuffed part. Okay, let me try to remember the controls in this game

241
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,360
So there's like, uh, I think the left shift is to throw your shoe

242
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,760
Left and that's how you can uh, that's how you can like test. Um

243
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,440
Yeah, that's how you'll test if your room is deadly, I think

244
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,320
For me, it's it helps me run

245
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,320
I

246
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:32,640
What's the alt settings controls? How do I throw my shoe?

247
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,680
I'll throw his g g

248
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,720
Ah, okay. Yeah, I'll make it so you can throw your shoe with g and then so I can like set off traps

249
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,760
throw boot

250
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,640
I'll make it I'll make it z

251
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,040
I

252
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,640
Think you throw that into a room and it might set off a trap that might kill you if you don't

253
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:03,120
If you don't do that, I think if you die, it doesn't matter that much because I think you just go back to the start

254
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,360
It doesn't even go far

255
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:13,040
What if I no, you don't have to feel like directly in front of you. Um, is there anything I mean, I'll be honest

256
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,960
Other than just like crouching and and how do you can you crouch? Hold on?

257
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:22,080
I don't I was trying to crouch with control with it. See action jump

258
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,920
Run, okay. I don't think you can crouch actually I lied

259
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,880
Um, so it's just like

260
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:34,880
WASD and then like action is e which is how you like use stuff like opening the doors. Okay

261
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:41,760
Uh, and then you throw your boot if you want now. Um, there is something about the markings

262
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,800
So, um, oh, I lost my shoe

263
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,920
Oh, yeah, I think that's the trap

264
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:57,360
No, I know I only want you. Yeah, you only get two shoes for the whole run. I think

265
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:03,360
No, okay. Um, I think if you look at the ground in front of the doors

266
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:09,760
I think this if I remember this color means the difficulty of the room or if it's safe or not. Oh, I'm getting sucked in

267
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,680
Oh

268
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:26,640
Okay, so that means we can't walk through that room because I think that one's too dangerous

269
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,600
And I think that one's gone

270
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,640
Uh, do you respawn?

271
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,880
I don't know. I'm

272
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,880
I'm waiting to show up respawn

273
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,240
Maybe it just takes a while. I haven't played this in 10 years. I can't remember

274
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:48,240
Oh, this room shows us green. So I think mortis is this one safe

275
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:53,280
Okay, there's like green

276
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,480
Wait, I still can't see you. I'm still not here

277
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,520
I'm still just let me see if I die then. Oh, this is this room safe

278
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,680
I think you think you're supposed to find which rooms are safe and like pass through them

279
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,240
Let me see if I'll die. I'm gonna eat

280
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,240
It was a good run

281
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,040
What's happening here? Oh

282
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,560
And only her shoes

283
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,520
Okay, okay, so I lied dying does matter

284
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:39,520
Okay, good to know. We're not gonna go. Okay. We'll try not to die. We'll try not to die

285
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:46,160
It's a race competition who gets there first so you don't respawn someone said

286
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,560
Oh

287
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:52,880
We don't work as a team. I don't I don't I don't have it set to first wins

288
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,280
I think I just have it set to anyone passes is fine. Okay less of a competition

289
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,760
Okay, so we can uh, we can test this one with my boot

290
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:13,520
Okay, I think it's good. Nice. No, it has a cool down on the doors. Yeah, what the heck

291
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,720
Okay, this room's safe. Uh, if you look in the top left, see how the room has a little tick

292
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,560
Oh, yeah, it's a little check mark. Yeah, that means it's safe. And if you press M, you can open like the big map

293
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,520
Oh

294
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,400
And we're looking for the room. That's the exit basically

295
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,840
Okay, we're gonna try not to die. You know, some rooms have puzzles, but I believe are survivable

296
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,280
Okay, I think it's unsafe nifty

297
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:47,680
Nice, that's two in a row. Wow, we're doing pretty good. Why is this one have a red?

298
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:55,280
Oh, that's the outside wall that means. Oh, it's a boundary. Yeah, that makes sense. Okay. I wasn't looking at the map

299
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:00,400
All right, um, which way do you want to go? Should we go this way or that way?

300
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:08,000
I think we can try this way. Yeah, let's keep hugging the the end. Yeah, I'll throw my boot

301
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,720
I feel like something is gonna happen

302
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,240
No, all right, maybe it's safe

303
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,600
Oh, it's safe. Nice. Wow. Okay

304
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,560
Oh, we can keep what we want. Yeah, let's just keep it going. We're doing pretty well

305
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,720
Easy so they're actually

306
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,400
All right, um, they're not gonna do anything you just gotta wait for them to pass

307
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,440
That's like, uh, this was random. Oh, he's walking through

308
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,560
Oh, yeah

309
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,320
Oh, that's so sad. Can I pick up can I pick up his head?

310
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,000
I don't know. I don't think so. Dang it. I wanted to use his bones in his body

311
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:54,560
I'm trying to I can't remember. Does that mean the room is dangerous or does that still mean it's safe? I'm gonna try with my boot

312
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,640
Wait, I think that's I think it's good now

313
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:04,000
I think if that I think they can only be like one event per room. Cool. Yeah, so

314
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:09,920
Yeah, I feel like that was the free free room. Just don't I think if you run into them, you might take fire damage

315
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,680
I lost this one

316
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,880
Hmm boot

317
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Oh, nope. Nope. That's it

318
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:27,280
Goodbye shoe. That's the one. Oh, that's the that's the electric one. All right. Now we know not that late

319
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,280
At least we have four tries between us. Yeah

320
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:37,360
Okay, this one shows us green which I think means it's safe, but I'll test it

321
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,160
It's not safe

322
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,400
I remember nothing

323
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,120
Oh, no, we're like kind of trapped in a corner. Should we go back to this room then?

324
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,600
Yeah, we might have to oh wait this one

325
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:55,840
Oh wait, this one is yellow like orange. Would you think means to can technically pass through it?

326
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,280
Oh

327
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,280
Does it set it off once?

328
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,480
I think it's just like it's like a laser that goes across. I think you just dodge it in my bear

329
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,440
All right, do you want to try it or

330
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,560
Hey, where'd you go?

331
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,200
Oh, you went to another room

332
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,840
Yeah, I wanted to see if this one's safer

333
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:20,080
I don't remember what the colors on the ground are supposed to mean

334
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,760
Let me boot it

335
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,080
Get booted

336
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,240
I think we're good. Hey, it says

337
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:36,640
Nifty. Okay. We probably don't have to take that. That's more dangerous one. Yeah, this will take the safer route

338
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,840
I don't know. I feel like this one's not

339
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,560
Oh, no, okay boot boots acquired

340
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:50,560
Okay, I think we're doing pretty good. We're doing pretty good. I'm pretty proud of us. Which way should we go this way?

341
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,720
I'll boot it. Yeah boot

342
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:02,080
Oh, wait, who is that? Oh, oh, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, careful careful careful careful. I think

343
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,880
I think I don't like that. He's laughing

344
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:11,440
I think this is one of the crazy like stuck in here people. So they're just gonna be in the corner like saying words

345
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,360
Hey, buddy

346
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:18,320
Hey, you doing all right? You can follow us out of there. He doesn't have any shoes

347
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,720
Oh, he's out of shoes. Oh, you can you can come with us

348
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:28,080
Yeah, you can use our shoes. All right. He's I think he's he's too far gone

349
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:35,520
He's just vibing. He's just vibing in the corner. Oh, yeah, do you want me to try to go this way?

350
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,080
What does it mean when it's yellow on the ground?

351
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,600
Maybe it's safe. Oh

352
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,680
Yeah, it's safe. Okay

353
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:52,160
I'm every time I'm scared. It's gonna close behind you and you're just gonna die

354
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:57,840
And I won't be able to see what happens. I don't remember what the colors on the ground are supposed to be

355
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:03,520
I haven't played this in so long. Yeah, you can tell me milk or if you're able to because I I used to know

356
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,200
Um, but I don't remember

357
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,800
I hate that I can hear that guy giggling

358
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,320
It's pretty creepy

359
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,400
Oh, no

360
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,400
Yeah, that one's deaf. Okay

361
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,720
What is going on in there?

362
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,640
We just find that exit. I'm out of shoes

363
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,840
I only have one left. I might try to go back and get my other shoe, but

364
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:38,160
Because it's not it's in the yellow one. I'm just maybe I can you want to try I run back

365
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:43,040
Yeah, I want to try to get my shoe back because it wasn't destroyed. It's just yeah, I feel like you can

366
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:48,240
Yeah, get that back. Yeah, if I set up the laser and then uh, we just run back in

367
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,720
Yeah, I can run back out once it's uh

368
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:56,720
I just have to be really fast. Oh wait. No, it's this way. Oh, I almost went into danger. Oh, yeah, sorry

369
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,040
Almost killed myself in minecraft

370
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,320
So I'm gonna throw out one shoe and then I'm gonna go get both of them because then I wish I could still be in there

371
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,440
Oh, yeah, I think it's I think it's activated now

372
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,320
Okay, so maybe if yellow means you can go back in

373
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,680
Wait, where's your other shoe?

374
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:23,520
Oh, the color tells you how many adjacent rooms have lethal traps. Oh, so it is like mine sleeper. Okay

375
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:30,400
Uh, if the tile is blue, none of the four connecting rooms have traps green equals one

376
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,320
Yellow is two purples three red is four. Oh

377
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:39,280
Yeah, it's like mine sleeper. Okay. So the next two rooms probably I definitely have traps then

378
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,480
Uh, this one the floor is green which means one of the rooms have traps. Oh

379
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,520
Oh, okay

380
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,160
So it it's it's one of these two

381
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,320
Have traps

382
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:58,080
But we kind of already have a safe path back, but I haven't noticed my shoe actually got destroyed. So I can't get it back

383
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,960
Dang it. I thought maybe it would be okay

384
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,560
Because the shoes are left when they exploded

385
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,520
That's true

386
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,800
Oh, okay, I keep going the wrong way. I know it's I'm trying to stare at the map

387
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,800
I keep also thinking I'm you

388
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,080
Oh poor guy, okay, so we know in front of us is deadly

389
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,280
Um, I can try this one

390
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,640
All right shoe it girl. Okay. You don't have any shoe

391
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,440
This room's yellow, which means only two are dangerous

392
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,400
Oh my god

393
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:58,000
Okay, we made it. We made it. I think that means it's safe now though because I think that's a one-time trap

394
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,440
I don't want to go find out

395
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,000
Yeah, I think the orange is a one-time trap

396
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:10,160
Oh, I'm glad we got back out though. I know at least it gives you a time. What is this?

397
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,280
Oh, blue means all the doors is safe. I think right

398
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:19,360
Let me check get blue none of the okay blue means that all all of the rooms next to this one are safe then

399
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,240
So we can check both sides

400
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,360
How do you yeah, how do you tell if and which is the exit?

401
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,480
I don't remember

402
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,400
I think

403
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,200
Um, okay, this is not the exit

404
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:42,320
All right, I gotta hear him. I can hear him laughing again. I know he's just like in the corner

405
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,960
I love this one

406
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,600
Um, I don't think this is the exit either

407
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,720
Yeah, okay

408
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,120
Yeah, we found we found most of this safe

409
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,560
I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm just I hate that the tight the cool down kills me

410
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,200
Yeah, the door is the doors are a pain in the butt. All right

411
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,040
All right, so which which means haven't we checked we've got like

412
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,240
Look at the map

413
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,240
There's the one in the center

414
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,160
Hmm, we could go straight through the center maybe

415
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,520
Yeah, let's do that. It's a good idea

416
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,880
We should be looking for blue rooms

417
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,240
Wait, if this is blue that means this room's also safe

418
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,720
Oh

419
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,920
And this is yeah, this is blue and all the ones around it is safe. Okay

420
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,520
Nice. Okay. We're making some really good progress

421
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,560
We got the sleuths in the chat helping

422
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,920
If I could open the damn door

423
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,480
Should we go should we go this way or should we go down?

424
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,840
Um, let me see what room uh adjacent to this one has

425
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,480
Oh wait, this one's this one's blue as well

426
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,720
Okay

427
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,280
Okay, so this is pretty much all safe rooms. Hmm

428
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,480
Should be good to go this one's green

429
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,360
this one

430
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,680
Follow the blue this room is oh yellow. That's dangerous. We should go green

431
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,240
Green only has one danger room

432
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,400
I'm just letting blue a guide me

433
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,120
like a

434
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,840
Like a silly child

435
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,040
If I run in and die, then you get some oh you still have a shoe

436
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,520
That's true. Okay. This is both green. I'm gonna throw my boot

437
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,560
Yeet

438
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,560
What is that? Wait, what does that mean?

439
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,600
Oh, it's a don't open that again

440
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,400
What that's um, that's a chainsaw guy

441
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,360
That sounds like a terminator

442
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,280
He's yeah, I don't can you leave that room?

443
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Can we I don't remember?

444
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,640
I'm kind of I'm tempted to know

445
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,360
Is he still there?

446
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:12,880
Hello, oh your shoes there. Oh, he's gone. Oh, nice. I can get my shoe back. Oh sick

447
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,400
All right

448
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,120
This one

449
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:24,640
Oh, oh, oh my god, he scared the crap out of me

450
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:31,040
Why are you in safe? Why are you throwing it back homey? What the heck is happening?

451
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,400
How have we not found the exit yet?

452
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Oh

453
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Oh

454
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,080
I'm trying

455
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:51,280
Oh my god, goodbye. Oh no. Oh no. I forgot you can sprint

456
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,960
I fought because the guy wasn't it was safe

457
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,880
So did I how did the guy not die in there?

458
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:06,880
Maybe you have to go closer to set it off. That was we were doing so well

459
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:12,000
Oh, no, that's right. We can we can keep trying. All right

460
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,680
Oh

461
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,680
sad

462
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,920
He's super

463
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,520
No, I think uh

464
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,840
Maybe

465
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:29,840
They this like maybe it's not until I go in the middle for the fan alone. I don't remember

466
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,280
Maybe and then it just gets activated

467
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,080
We always going to use the shoes

468
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,400
shoe

469
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,160
Okay, so this room is green which means one room has a chat. That's yellow

470
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,040
Blue room

471
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,920
But a green room is okay if we can't find a blue one. Oh, this one's blue. Let me test it

472
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,960
There's a dude in this room running around that this one's uh, this one's deaf

473
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,840
I found the trap we can go this one

474
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,440
Oh, we remember we don't know even if a guy's in there

475
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:10,640
Because the floor is green that can only be one trap. Oh, and that's the trap. You're right. So yeah, that should be it

476
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:15,200
I think that counts temporary traps as well

477
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,920
I hate this. Oh, no, that only leads to lethal traps all

478
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,440
Wait, is lethal traps all around us?

479
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,960
Um, yeah, why do you sound like a duck? Oh, I want this one. Hold on. It says blue

480
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,360
Never mind

481
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,560
That's too bad

482
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,960
You're playing tag with him

483
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,800
Sorry, the room's getting to me. Yeah, I don't blame you at all

484
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,440
Oh

485
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:04,320
Was not paying attention that's the flame thriller of is that one

486
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,040
Orange or you've got a red one

487
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Oh

488
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,160
Let's see if it does it again

489
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:17,840
I think we're good. Let me test it as I walk in

490
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,680
Oh

491
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:26,800
Where'd my book go? Wait, did I oh no, I've I lost one already. Yeah, we both lost one to like the same type of trap

492
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,720
Okay, uh

493
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,400
Let me see

494
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,400
I wish like I would stop laughing

495
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:39,920
Okay, this one's green, but it's also a corner room. Let me try the other one first

496
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,320
On the end

497
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,560
Okay

498
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,560
So there's only one way to go

499
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,160
Wait, if the floor is green

500
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,120
You said it's one trap, right?

501
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:07,120
Yeah, and there's only one direction we can go. So I think that means this one's a trap. That makes sense. Yeah, that's not

502
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,960
Yeah, we mind sleeper mind sleeper

503
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,760
Big brain gotta gotta be careful

504
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:18,400
It'd be cool if we can mark them as dead. He's that yeah, that would be nice

505
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,280
If you can get in my way, so this should be safe then

506
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,320
Let's trap light to me. No, look it

507
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,040
Okay, orange

508
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,560
That one's death and there should be

509
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,960
Okay, so yellow

510
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:39,840
Yellow means there's two. Wait, so I think both of these ways are yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. Oh, you'll have to come back

511
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:50,640
He's so he's so creepy. He really is I wish he would stop

512
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,880
Oh

513
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,480
His mouth isn't even like moving or anything

514
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,560
No, he has the most normal face

515
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:16,080
All right, oh at least we can jump I didn't know that jump actually no, I jumped multiple times. Um, okay, so

516
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,160
map

517
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:23,600
We could head towards the top left corner. This one's green, which means I think it's running out

518
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,880
One which is that way so we can go up or down

519
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,520
Long go up. Yeah. Yeah

520
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,920
That's something

521
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,080
Wait, I'm going the wrong way

522
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,320
Where is it? Where is it? There it is

523
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,840
We're all okay turned around

524
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,640
All right, this one it should be safe

525
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,480
I don't even I didn't even throw it

526
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,680
I think we're good. I I tested it with my body

527
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,840
I said

528
00:44:54,080 --> 00:45:00,880
All right, yellow is not great means one direction is definitely dangerous. Uh, do you want to boot it boot?

529
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:09,040
I think we're good. Oh wait that quick kick wait. No, it's not it's not good over the door over the door over the door

530
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:20,080
Oh, wait, I think this one you can walk through you just can't get hit by the laser

531
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:27,120
Oh, so if necessary, we could make it through it. All right, but let me check this one just in case this one's worse

532
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,240
Um, but

533
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,920
Oh, wait, I think this one's good. I think this one's good

534
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:40,320
Yeah, yeah safety. Okay. We'll we'll take this safe route

535
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:45,600
What this one? Um, what color was the room that we set that drop off in?

536
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,720
Oh, what does pink mean?

537
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,040
Is pink the exit

538
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:57,040
Purple means that there's every three adjacent traps, which means like every every trap

539
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:01,360
Every every yeah, every single exit on that room is a trap

540
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,080
Really? Oh, it's purple purple means. Oh, yeah

541
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,120
Red means there's four so that's even worse

542
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,160
Okay, maybe this way this one's green

543
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,280
Oh, oh wait, this is got a guy. It's got a guy

544
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:22,480
Oh, but it's a trap guy. I'm about to kill that guy. I'm so sorry guy

545
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,440
I kind of want to watch him die. Yeah

546
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,400
Open the door

547
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,280
Oh, I wish you could have grabbed you might be able to grab your shoe

548
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,480
Well, I think I've just got slime

549
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:42,240
All right, that's acid, which I think we can't walk on

550
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,640
That's maybe who knows we could try it

551
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,840
Oh, we can definitely

552
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,920
Oh my god, you could definitely grab your shoe

553
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:59,120
Grab it

554
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,400
Over the timing

555
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,520
I'm gonna run it and grab it as soon as it's on

556
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,960
Go

557
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,760
No, are you good

558
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,400
Oh my god, are you gonna die?

559
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,400
Am I gonna watch you?

560
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,880
Oh, I could take your shoe

561
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:27,520
Oh, you know, at least you got two shoes now. I can you can go on without me. All right, let's see

562
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:30,240
I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm just gonna speed run through these

563
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,880
Yeah

564
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:37,280
Wait, isn't this the bad room wait, that's the bat means that you can't go through any of those don't never mind

565
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,360
Well, actually, let's see. Let's see you can you can go right

566
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:47,280
Um, because remember the one with the spinning laser like the electricity one

567
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:56,640
If you go on to your right over here, uh, the one that we have marked is orange. Yeah

568
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:06,640
This one this one you can go through you just can't get hit by the lasers. All right. Let's try it. You should be fine. Yeah

569
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,600
Let's not get hit by the palpitate machine

570
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:15,440
I'm gonna go over here. Oh, and it's blue. So all the rooms are safe. Oh, okay

571
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,720
Yippee

572
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,880
Wait, oh

573
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:26,720
That doesn't mean the room is dangerous. That's just the door is dangerous

574
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,480
Speed run speed run

575
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:38,800
Oh, we're going on the danger door. Oh, I was trying to run through it. It's an ice machine

576
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,960
Did I just get squirted to death? What's happening? You did

577
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,480
I was pretty bad. Well, it was a good attempt. That was not bad.

578
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:51,200
We're learning. We're learning. One of these times we're going to win

579
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,680
I believe in us

580
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,680
I'm gonna use some beef jerky for good luck

581
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:05,760
Oh, did they have breakfast already? You said you had a pop part. Yeah, but now I'm having a beef jerky

582
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:09,200
I need I need the protein, you know

583
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:14,320
This is a classic balanced american breakfast. I've heard. Mm-hmm. Yep

584
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,200
A strawberry pop tart

585
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,880
All I need is a gun at my hip

586
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:30,400
Okay, this room is blue. So if it's safe, that'll be nice. I'll boot it. Oh

587
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,440
Oh, I think it's safe

588
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:39,120
Yay, okay. Should I go down or should we do the edge?

589
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:42,880
But you should still check doors because they can still be dangerous

590
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,440
Okay, I think this one's good

591
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,200
Now they throw a shoe at you

592
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,840
Okay, green means the one is dangerous

593
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:02,720
She keeps telling me which ones are dangerous and which one aren't and I keep forgetting

594
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
meaning the colors

595
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,720
Yeah, this doesn't necessarily mean the room is dangerous. It's just the door is trapped

596
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:17,360
I think that'll only go off once though. I think I don't yeah, I think the fire ones only went off once. Let's try it. Yeah

597
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,680
Gonna boot it

598
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,200
Oh

599
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,200
Oh, I guess it's gonna save then

600
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:28,400
Okay trap doors uh can still be entered. This is yellow though. Does that mean three?

601
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,400
Oh

602
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,400
I read it yellow is two

603
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,240
Okay

604
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:38,800
So half the rooms are dangerous which is we've already got the one we came from is safe

605
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,680
So we just have to find the other one

606
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,520
Yeah

607
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,840
Oh, I heard something

608
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,720
Who did I oh oh ice room

609
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:56,000
Wait, this one this one might be possible to pass through if we need to

610
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:02,560
Let me grab my shoe. Yeah, I was gonna say you can grab your shoe. Okay, so this one will drop ice

611
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,240
Uh, what's this one?

612
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,240
Let's see if this one's worth

613
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,240
eat

614
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:17,520
Perfect nice we're golden unless something falls from the ceiling like it usually does when I walk in

615
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:23,600
Um, let me try this one. This one's only got one danger

616
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,160
Oh

617
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,280
Lucky get shabu did

618
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,720
Nice

619
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:38,960
Wait, this is a good good path so far. Yeah, good path. I'm gonna go this way

620
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,080
Yeet

621
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:43,200
Yeah

622
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:46,080
Never mind. Not so good. All right. That's okay

623
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:50,480
That's the only trap then because it's green. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

624
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:56,000
This room should be safe then. Oh, we're kind of going back in a circle. Oh, yeah, let's go wait. Where is it?

625
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,280
Where is it down?

626
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
We can go we can go. Yeah, we can backtrack

627
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:07,680
Backtrack a little bit here

628
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,680
And then go down

629
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,680
Oh

630
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:23,680
It's down safe wait, I think that is safe because they're in this green. That's oh wait, is it is there a guy in there?

631
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,360
Oh, yeah, there's a guy just a dude doing dude stuff

632
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,320
Waiting for a fan to open in the center

633
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:36,800
Uh, this one's yellow which they said means two and I think that's this way and that way. I think those buffers

634
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,760
Oh, yeah, two ways so

635
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,320
You might want to test it. So just in case

636
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,280
What

637
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,600
Yeah

638
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:57,280
Checking shoes taken names or this one green means one. So one direction. Please let it not be this direction. Oh, I can't throw

639
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,960
Oh, oh, we could go this way ice. There's ice this one

640
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,880
Once this is gone, uh, I'll boot it

641
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:14,880
So open up. Where's the door stay open longer? I know the time the cooldown is quite

642
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,680
Oh, well, I will boot it. Never mind

643
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,880
This is not a good area

644
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,400
Oh

645
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:29,040
Oh my god, explosion just gets me every time

646
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,680
But then aren't we backed into a corner?

647
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,920
This is a dead end. Yeah

648
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,640
She's like it's safe

649
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:45,360
We still have I have both boots and you have oh, yeah, I have no boots. I am barefoot. I'm living my life

650
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,760
What is this one? This one is orange

651
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,720
I'm gonna boot it

652
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:57,920
Oh, I think this trap might have been one time. I'm gonna. Yeah, was it the ice one. I can't remember. Yeah, I think it was once

653
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:04,480
Okay, throw myself in. Oh wait, and the the down this way is red. So that means this way safe

654
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:07,760
Oh, that's purple. Oh rip

655
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,880
I mean purple is not impossible

656
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,440
What what it is, isn't it?

657
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,920
Wait come on

658
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:20,080
Purple means three is dangerous, but we were already in an orange one which counts

659
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:24,800
Hmm. So I think one of the directions might be okay. We can test

660
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,440
Do you want to waste your shoes though?

661
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:32,080
I've got two of them. We might be close to the exit. Let me test this one

662
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,160
Nope

663
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:39,120
Okay, that's good. Uh

664
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:41,920
Wait, you're running in and out

665
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,680
I think that I think that was actually fine. I think you're good

666
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:50,800
Nifty. Oh, oh, yay. I found it

667
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:55,600
I can't open the door for you. It's okay. All right, and this is green

668
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:02,960
Uh, which means one one of the directions is bad. Let's see which direction

669
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:11,600
Uh, I mean, I've got one boot left. Wait, this one's this one's yellow, which means, um

670
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:19,600
Which means both of the directions off of it are also bad. So I have to go this way

671
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,600
Oh

672
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:29,360
Oh, what's that? What is that? Wait, I think that's the exit. Oh, what?

673
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,600
Ah

674
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:52,000
You know what I'm ready. Do we get extra shoes? Can I get shoes on my hands?

675
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
I

676
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:59,840
Think we can try medium. That was easy. Yeah, it was too easy for us

677
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:10,240
I couldn't figure out what the exit looked like because I didn't remember. No, we know

678
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:14,160
No, wait every start actually let me um

679
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,800
Take the time return the lobby

680
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:22,240
Winner winner chicken shabiner

681
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:30,720
Standard unity asset dance, yeah

682
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,680
I think all the models are also unity assets

683
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:41,360
Yeah, something this this is very all very familiar somehow

684
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:44,080
I

685
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:49,280
I'll set the difficulty to medium this time. Do you don't make the map bigger?

686
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,960
Sure if you want

687
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:56,320
We can do a medium and eight by eight that way it'll take a little longer

688
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,640
But I think making the map bigger might mean we have more options too, right?

689
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,400
I hope so

690
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:10,640
We won't get as many dead ends. Let me turn seven by seven. We'll move up slowly

691
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:15,920
By the way, you can do up to 13 by 13. Oh my god

692
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:19,120
That would take so long

693
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:24,160
Okay, also music is an option to there's an option to turn off the mini map

694
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,200
Oh, no, remember

695
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:31,600
That's terrible. I would actually die me too. You're an old man

696
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:38,160
Like you're a woman this time. You be finally what I've always wanted

697
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:44,160
Um, you gotta pull me tail and red lipstick. Oh me for I wish I could see it my reflection

698
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:50,000
I didn't realize that you opened that and it scared me

699
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,680
Double shooting it up

700
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:58,400
Um, should we go are we gonna like hug the corners hug the edges?

701
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:02,720
Uh, I think one of the directions is bad

702
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:06,560
Hopefully it's not this direction. Let's go

703
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:11,120
Oh

704
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,160
Through it at you

705
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:19,200
I don't know what that is. Wait, I think I think this one might be okay. Oh

706
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:23,680
We just have to wait for him to finish killing everything in the room first

707
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,680
I kind of want to open the door to see what happens though

708
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:29,280
I don't mean to I don't think you can leave their room, right?

709
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,840
Oh, you killed my shoe

710
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:35,760
Wait, he's got shoes on. Oh my gosh got stuck

711
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,720
Can we kill him for his shoes?

712
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,720
Okay, I think he did spawn okay

713
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:48,560
That's not fair he kills my shoe

714
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:55,840
Okay, let me this room is blue so we can just walk straight through it nice or we can go this way

715
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:59,120
Yeah, I want to go down check this room. What color is that one yellow?

716
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:02,080
This one's green. This one's green. That's good

717
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:06,480
Because the room we just went in those orange this one's safe in every direction then

718
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:12,080
Oh, I can try this way this room is also green

719
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:19,520
Oh, I mean that doesn't mean the rooms. That's like a door trap. I think he's kind of why does he walk it is slow though?

720
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,920
Oh

721
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:28,800
Nice subtle explosion. Are you telling me I can't pick up his bones. Are you telling me?

722
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:32,800
Because if we could use his head as a trap for yeah, like come on

723
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,720
I'm gonna go this one

724
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,560
I wonder if I can get more in the middle, maybe

725
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:44,160
Am I gonna eat a real lunch? No, this one's blue

726
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:48,800
This looks nice if it was safe. Hey, I think yeah, we're good

727
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,800
Okay, and all directions are also good

728
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:55,840
Attraction maybe that bigger means some more

729
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,640
No, it's not safe

730
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:01,280
It's not safe

731
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:20,320
It was uh, there were icicles that dropped from the middle

732
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Yeah, I could I could see that now

733
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:30,880
But I mean it means the edges were safe so we know that for the future. Oh god. I'm never stepping in the center of the room again

734
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,840
Yeah, we'll stick to the outer edges. Oh, that one's yellow. It's okay. I'll I'll try to

735
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:41,760
Try to find the exit quickly. Oh, that was purple. Nope

736
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,640
Uh, okay, what's this one?

737
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:48,080
Please give me something good green. I can work with green boot

738
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:51,600
boot

739
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:55,600
Well, I think it's safe. Please be safe. Please be safe. Please be safe

740
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,960
Stone step in the center

741
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:01,120
It's it's give us give us the tick

742
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:02,960
Okay, cool

743
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:07,520
Okay, um, and if the room we came from was orange, I think I think every direction is safe

744
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:10,400
Then I'll still be careful. I'm gonna boot everything

745
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:15,040
There she goes

746
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:18,560
I'm just gonna start like gaming commenting over your um

747
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:21,280
Hmm your gameplay hold on me

748
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:34,320
I have nothing to say about that one folks a man just ran in almost kamikaze'd her absolutely terrifying

749
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:36,640
She's moving on to the next room

750
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:43,360
MLG she be cast

751
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:50,160
For was deciding where to go next. She's eyeing a door. She's opening it ready to throw her shoe

752
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:52,720
The door is opening slowly

753
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,880
yeet

754
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:56,960
beautiful

755
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:01,120
Now this one's safe

756
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:07,760
I'm making good progress somehow. Yeah, she really is but pure chance. I'm picking the safe room. Oh, jeez. It's good

757
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:10,720
Okay, that's gonna run out. I don't trust it

758
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:14,160
What are you what are you saying, buddy?

759
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:20,640
Fua has met a new teammate. He is currently running in a circle

760
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:23,760
Very intense stuff amazing

761
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,240
Uh form in his run

762
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:30,960
Oh, this would be awesome. Let me try it if you could beat them into a room

763
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:35,200
That'd be great. Throw some throw some crumbs on the ground

764
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,400
You want some food there, buddy

765
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:43,600
Yeah, I think we have this one safe too. How how is every room? I'm guessing safe

766
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,400
I'm just bad luck. It seems

767
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:51,600
With she be dead. She is able to move forward looking for the safe room

768
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:58,880
I'm checking for a blue room. Okay, the both green. Oh, it's another guy

769
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:04,400
Sorry, maybe if you just like run in real fast. Okay. Yeah. Oh

770
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:06,400
Oh

771
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:08,720
My boat

772
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,720
Not the boot

773
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:14,320
It's new friend clucking. Yes

774
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:17,440
She means no to have bad luck. Yes

775
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:20,240
Oh

776
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:22,560
I don't know how I'm getting so so lucky

777
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,880
Oh, do you see that jump? Dang. He's got moves

778
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:32,000
I can't do that. Right, buddy. He's he's skipping

779
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:38,640
I really wanted I really want to see the person in the booth that recorded this

780
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:46,400
Oh, what is that a black hole? Oh, okay. That was very dangerous actually

781
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:50,000
I don't know if the black hole is temporary

782
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:53,280
But I think that was the only capsule

783
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,840
boot

784
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:59,760
Oh, there you go find the exit for both of us. Oh, well, it is yellow

785
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:03,200
So I think you should you are good if you were to go through that room again

786
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:06,720
And this one's blue. So I think this is safe, right?

787
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:12,400
You had a boot and you didn't use it just waiting for you just to like combust

788
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:19,840
I mean the ground was blue. So I don't think there can be traps, right? That's a good point. Oh, it's another guy

789
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:23,040
There's so many though. Okay last boot

790
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:31,040
Oh, we're golden. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, just avoid the center just in case

791
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,360
Well, this is blue blue room. Oh, no

792
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:38,880
Oh my god

793
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:42,880
Goodbye boot. I'll miss you. Oh, you did the most boot

794
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:48,560
All right. Good luck. Let's go green and that was this one's safe, right?

795
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:53,920
Yeah, I think you're good. Okay in this room

796
01:04:55,040 --> 01:05:00,640
Um, yellow dangerous. So this one should also be safe. Oh god. I don't want to go in a yellow room

797
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:03,040
Oh

798
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:07,200
I'm gonna backtrack for a moment. Go for it

799
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:15,520
All right, let me check this one. This one's green. Oh, no, that means this way's also it could be a yellow room though

800
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:18,320
So

801
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:20,320
All right, what was this one?

802
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,120
Wait, this one's blue. Okay. Okay. This one's both directions are safe.

803
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:29,920
Not careful of the doors though still all right. I don't want to get lasered like I did

804
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:32,880
um, what's this one

805
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:36,720
Trying to find the exits. I want like run in run out

806
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:40,160
Oh my god, you have the most ultimate luck

807
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,760
Yeah, somehow

808
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,920
She's zoom in everybody. This is the medium difficulty

809
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:52,400
I don't have any boots to find the danger room

810
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:55,360
Okay, you got blue and green

811
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:14,000
It was a good one folks in the end who would get slimed and tends to acid bits

812
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:18,480
Yeah, it was pretty good

813
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:23,040
In the arms of the angel

814
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:27,280
Wait, we're getting tired again. This one's much harder

815
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:32,400
Oh, you I don't know you made that look pretty easy. I was very impressed with your skill

816
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:36,160
I was just running all what?

817
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:39,920
What how don't we start in the purple room? What?

818
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:43,280
Wait every single direction is dangerous then

819
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:47,360
Huh, how do we well, maybe it's um

820
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:50,560
Maybe it's like there's a trap room

821
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:53,360
Yeah

822
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:56,160
All right god speed

823
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:58,720
Let's go. Let's try this. There's a dude in this one boot

824
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:06,000
Uh, well, this one's the sun. Um, so I think this one this one has the ice. Okay. I think it's this one. Yeah. Yeah

825
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:08,080
I think this is good. Yeah, this one's fine

826
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:11,520
What try to get my boot back this one may get my boot too

827
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:17,840
Oh, this guy's still alive too. Can I live through that? Oh, no, I think it ate my boot

828
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:19,920
Never mind

829
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Still going off

830
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:25,200
All right, nice

831
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:27,600
This way. Yeah, this one's blue. So

832
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:31,680
Oh yellow that means all directions are safe

833
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:38,240
All right, do you want to go yellow is not great

834
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:45,840
Let's try this way. I think I think yellow means that one of the direction has to be dangerous. Okay. Let's try it

835
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:48,240
It's that one

836
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:50,240
Oh, this one we can go in then

837
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:04,480
Oh my gosh, we are winners gamers get all to make gamers

838
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:08,640
Easy

839
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:10,880
speed running half dead

840
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:12,880
I

841
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:16,400
Just not good. I wish I could like orange justice

842
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:26,720
Dancers and stuff we can do in game. Yeah any emotes do you have any like an emote wheel?

843
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:29,920
uh jump throw

844
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:33,520
Team chat

845
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:37,920
Nah mark dangerous rooms. Oh, we can mark dangerous room. Wait, where's the oh, it's oh

846
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:40,800
Oh

847
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:48,960
Oh, you can put an exclamation mark on the mini map. Oh, okay. Oh, all right

848
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:54,640
We don't have a dance though, but we did start in the blue room. Which is safe. That's nice. That's nifty

849
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:58,880
So I can go in any of the rooms but still be careful the doors. They can still be deadly

850
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:02,560
Okay

851
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,640
There's one of these directions blue

852
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:07,040
That would be great

853
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,600
Oh

854
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:13,920
Careful the middle still though. Yeah, I'm still I'm not trust in no middle

855
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:19,680
Blue blue blue green green with this one

856
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:28,000
I believe we found it that yellow. I know that was really impressive. So we go to the green one. Oh, yeah, we can go green

857
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:30,880
Oh bad. It's not so bad

858
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:33,600
That's so slow

859
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:36,160
Oh

860
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:41,840
Maybe uh, oh that one's yellow. That's

861
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:45,200
What's this one?

862
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:47,680
This one is green is what I put it

863
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:51,680
Oh, what does that one do?

864
01:09:54,080 --> 01:10:00,160
Oh, it's an exploding guy. He's gonna he's gonna explode. Okay, then make sure we can still walk through there

865
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:03,360
Yeah, maybe you're hopefully your shoe is still there. Oh sweet

866
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:06,480
Nice free shoes

867
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:14,000
Okay, let's let's test it first then we can get a free boot. That's lucky. Yeah, let's I'm gonna mark it on the map

868
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,800
Okay, careful the store is laser

869
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
I'm trying to

870
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,800
Mark it. Oh, I hear someone in here

871
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:29,760
Hi buddy, how you doing kiddo?

872
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:37,760
I don't think he's okay. He's doing like hopscotch or something. I don't know

873
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:47,360
Okay, I put a red exclamation point on this room under the yellow so it looks like we should we know where the boot is

874
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:50,160
Excuse me, sir

875
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:52,160
Oh

876
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:57,120
Oh

877
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:04,720
Hopefully this is a good room. Hopefully this is a good room. It's not a good room. It's not a good room

878
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:18,880
Oh, I totally wasn't pretty good. I thought we didn't have any rooms around us. I'm so silly

879
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:24,720
Oh, why am I like this? Wait, actually

880
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:29,680
Oh, wait, no, this won't kill me. Oh, I thought that it would kill me

881
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:34,000
Rest in peace. All right, let's see how long I can go

882
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:40,240
Just running into random rooms. Oh nice. Enjoy the purple room

883
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:42,960
So there's one one way is safe, right?

884
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:47,280
I was gonna find it. Yeah, it's that one. No, it's not. It's that one

885
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:52,720
It's this one. This one's safe. It's it feels good to me. It's this one pretty sure

886
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:57,760
Yeah, see why is this room also purple? No

887
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:01,760
Wait, what was that? I don't even know

888
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:09,680
Uh, oh, I think you don't even know what happened. Well, you can grab the shoe because your shoes are over there

889
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:12,480
True. I got an extra boot

890
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:15,200
Let's go

891
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:17,840
With the foo, I carry this one

892
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:21,440
Did we test this one? I don't know

893
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:29,760
Oh wait, that room's green. So I think it's good. Okay, I'll start a speed run

894
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:38,080
Maybe this one feeling good about it. It's yellow. Oh, what's this one?

895
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:40,960
Oh

896
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,120
Pick the safer of the yellows

897
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:52,480
Okay, so one of these sections is safe

898
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:57,360
Another yellow. What are you? Let's get a blue

899
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:00,720
Another yellow. Okay

900
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:03,120
boot

901
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:04,640
Not that one

902
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:05,760
boot

903
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:07,920
This one should be safe winner winner

904
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:12,960
Oh, okay. What is this one? Wait, I think it's almost deadly. Oh, hello

905
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:20,000
Hey buddy, you can explode he's taking a sweet time

906
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:25,520
He's cool guys don't look at explosions

907
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:34,480
Uh, what about where you came from? I kind of want to like give that guy a hug

908
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:38,240
and see if

909
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:46,800
I forgot I forget when you hear that stone noise like a stone being moved. There's icicles in there. That was a double trap

910
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:51,360
What the hell ouch

911
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:57,600
I forgot it. We're not supposed to go in the middle. Yeah. Oh my gosh

912
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:02,400
Hey, look at him this time

913
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,600
I'm I'm feeling good

914
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:13,200
I'm feeling good. We're gonna we you know after that one speed run we just did of course we're gonna have one

915
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:15,600
That doesn't go so smoothly. That's true. We can

916
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:22,000
We used all of our power. Oh blue with this one. Oh, no

917
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:26,480
But it means that we can wait if that one's blue. I mean, oh

918
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:31,840
Is it gonna if it's blue that means that all their rooms? How do you mark them as safe?

919
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:36,000
Um, do you see that thing? Oh

920
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:45,040
Oh, I can mark them as blue. Okay. Yeah, it means those two rooms around it are safe

921
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:50,880
So if we can get to them we can go through them

922
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:58,000
So this room should be safe, but avoid the middle still. What type is happening? I just froze. Oh, I have to unclick. Oh

923
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:05,360
Um, if I did this correctly this room should also be safe

924
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:12,000
I wish that it would show up for me as well

925
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:15,920
Yeah, I think the exclamation point is local. Yeah

926
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:18,880
I marked it anyways

927
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:22,560
It's pretty smart though

928
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:25,440
It would be nice if this one was safe

929
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:32,880
It should be yeah, because it was it's not won't step in the middle and this one is safe

930
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:38,640
Oh careful doesn't mean it can't have guns

931
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:43,200
What is that? That's not the fire like before

932
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:46,560
Okay, it's uh

933
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:49,040
Sun laser a sun laser

934
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:52,480
At least the power of the sun

935
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:59,920
The power of the sun in the palm of this one is yellow, but since this room is a trap

936
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:04,720
Uh, wait, which is yellow too. Oh wait yellow means both

937
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:09,840
Oh, okay, so never mind. We can still we can still see if it's a deadly trap. We can boot it

938
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:12,640
Yep

939
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:14,400
No

940
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:16,400
Are you out of boots?

941
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:21,200
Oh, am I? Yeah. I'm out. I'm out of boots already out of boots. Oh, no

942
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
I got too boot-happy

943
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:27,040
You got that booty

944
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:40,080
We're good. We're good. Um

945
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:46,160
Wait, is this one's yellow and both the directions would better save than I think

946
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:53,120
Oh, you ran in I thought you were still in there. It's like wait, why are you I lived I lived

947
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:56,560
Um, I think we would have to backtrack a little bit

948
01:16:57,680 --> 01:17:02,960
Oh, yeah, because I think this is yellow then it's got two death and two of the we've already found the safe ones

949
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:09,760
This one's also yellow, which means this one should be death

950
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:14,800
Like that it's purple. No, I don't have one boot

951
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:22,400
Okay, that means that if that one is purple, should we backtrack some more and go up here?

952
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:26,800
Oh, it's purple then all of these could be deadly. Okay

953
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:33,040
I was marking them. Wait, this one should be deadly then though, right? Because it's pink on the other side

954
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:35,920
But yeah, it's probably something

955
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:40,240
Oh, wait, this one's not bad. We can just wait right for these spawn

956
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:45,840
Don't blow up my shoe. Oh, yeah, we can get your shoes too. You can get a free shoe. Yay

957
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:48,400
Nice, that's lucky actually

958
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:50,720
sick

959
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:52,720
Free boot get that boot

960
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:56,320
All right, I'm not bootless anymore

961
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:00,240
Oh, hi, what color is it yellow?

962
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:06,800
Uh, it was the one down here that's dangerous, right?

963
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:14,080
Did you mark it on your right? I remember I'm like the different one. Okay

964
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:19,840
So this one could be old purple though, so it's yeah, I think that was I'm just gonna

965
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:22,880
Ignore that one

966
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:25,120
Yeah, oh, this is all so purple

967
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:31,440
Maybe this one, please one is green green. That's not bad. Yeah, try this one

968
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:36,320
What is it doing? Oh, it's like lit up guy that one's not

969
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:41,760
Please don't that's the chainsaw, man. Please don't kill my shoe

970
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:44,720
Hopefully not

971
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Did you kill my shoe? We can uh

972
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:53,520
Can I grab it? I can go through this room. Oh, I grabbed it. Oh sweet. Nice

973
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:58,320
Okay, that's not bad. We're we're doing good making progress

974
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:04,800
I think all the directions should be safe because the room we came from counts as long as I'll check

975
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:10,480
This one's a yellow. Oh, I can't throw

976
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:14,240
And I think I think this corner should be safe

977
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:18,640
Okay, over here is safe, but it's a corner, but I can check if it's uh

978
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:21,440
I can check if it's the ending. No, it's not. Okay

979
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:26,240
Okay, well, I marked it with that stitch

980
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:31,360
Hey, I was just marking that corner sick

981
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:38,080
Well, we'll color this one. Oh, okay one direction bad one direction is good

982
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:42,160
Please don't oh, I knew it was going to be pink

983
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:50,080
She's telling about you

984
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:52,080
He took a shit. Oh no, uh-oh

985
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:56,000
Wait, that means this one's safe, but it is um

986
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:59,200
It is it is purple

987
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:06,160
So wait, wait a minute. I do know I do know that this way is dangerous and I do know that this way is dangerous

988
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:08,720
Okay, so it's this one

989
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:13,920
Wait, no, because then you said it was this is the only one then because you said it's all of them except for one

990
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:22,080
Which means it could be livable you can risk it risk it for the biscuit. Hopefully it's a door trap

991
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:25,440
Yeah, why is the one purple too? Oh, man

992
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Uh, what's this one? What's this one?

993
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:31,360
Maybe this one's not that bad

994
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:33,360
Oh, wait

995
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:38,720
Yeah, we already we already said that was that was we've already went in here. Oh, there's a guy that blew up

996
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:42,400
Can we go this way?

997
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:44,400
Oh my god, we're surrounded by purple

998
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:51,280
But let me look at the map. Which direction can we go? Uh, we're like we need to go to well, we could backtrack

999
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:56,560
I think we have to yeah, yeah and go all the way back near that where that yellow is

1000
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:58,560
Hmm

1001
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:08,320
I don't remember what that yellow one was. Yeah, do I maybe it was a guy that also I think maybe it was a chainsaw, dude

1002
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:13,200
Let's see

1003
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:16,640
This one is oh, it's the blade

1004
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:21,360
We can run through it. You just have to be really fast. Yeah, which one do you want to go to?

1005
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:26,400
So any direction safe. Um, do you want to let's try rushing left? Okay

1006
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:32,720
All right, three two one run

1007
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:37,600
Let's pull me

1008
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:39,680
Oh, of course it's a purple purple

1009
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:44,320
Well, I mean, we've already know that two of them are traps so we could check one of the other directions

1010
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:48,800
I will boot this door just in case

1011
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:55,120
Teleport guy. Oh, that's not bad. That's not bad. That's it. Oh, okay

1012
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:57,840
Is he gonna destroy your shoe?

1013
01:21:57,920 --> 01:21:59,920
Yeah, that's not bad

1014
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Okay, that's that's you might be able to grab it

1015
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:08,880
Oh, is he done? Oh, that was quick. Yeah, he was fast. I was a fast guy

1016
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:12,560
All right, we might still have a chance

1017
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:15,600
Um, this room's yellow

1018
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:18,400
means two directions are dangerous

1019
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:21,360
Um

1020
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:24,720
I want to beat a room. I'm scared. It's gonna have the laser

1021
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:29,840
Laser walls, if you're yeah, the laser walls of the trap. I'm gonna bait it

1022
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:31,760
Oh

1023
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:33,760
I'll boot it just in case. Oh, oh

1024
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:40,720
Okay, but back up the this one is okay once it's already gone off, but nice. I might lose my boots. No, not the boot

1025
01:22:44,240 --> 01:22:47,440
Wait, what do you mean woman on the stream, you know, I'm a woman, right?

1026
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:50,480
You're a woman

1027
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:54,800
I count you come on. What do you mean? What?

1028
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:00,480
Hey

1029
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:03,600
I am an adult woman

1030
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:07,520
She just happens to have cat ears. Okay. She's just a little bit different

1031
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:12,880
Okay, this one's safe now, but I did lose my boot

1032
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:20,080
Okay, we'll have to bait stuff actually. No, I got the dogs out. Oh, they bark in

1033
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:24,640
Oh

1034
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:29,520
I think both. What does the red mean that that means every directions. Okay. We're not gonna go that way

1035
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:31,760
That's what what is this guy doing in there?

1036
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:37,040
Let's let you know. It's okay. Purple. They're both purple on either side. Um

1037
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:40,560
Oh that should be backtrack

1038
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:42,560
I

1039
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:45,120
Think we probably should

1040
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:49,840
Damn, this one's hard. Uh, we can try it

1041
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:55,360
Um, what should we go down? This one was yellow. Yeah, we could try one of the other rooms

1042
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:59,520
I'll do it. What's this? Yep. Yeah

1043
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:02,320
No, oh no, goodbye

1044
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:07,520
I wish if I hugged the edge. I feel like if I hugged the edge, I shouldn't die

1045
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:10,480
That's why they put the blue there

1046
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:16,000
Okay, well, um, I know we're both the traps but that one's a dead end

1047
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:19,520
Rip

1048
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:21,600
Okay, um

1049
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:23,840
I will I will purchase

1050
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:30,960
I'm so proud of this game. I thought fool was a 43 year old man from michigan

1051
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:36,240
Did you hear that god damn

1052
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:44,400
I already told you I'm a 73 year old man. Not 43. Oh my god. I'm a 56 year old woman. He stayed

1053
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:56,160
My time I got you pooped over there. Why are there gray clouds? Wait, I think this is gonna save us. Oh, I was wrong

1054
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:04,640
I've made a grave error. Why is it always the acid? Why is it always the acid with me?

1055
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:07,360
I know you always

1056
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:09,920
You always get Nickelodeon slined

1057
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:13,040
um, man

1058
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:15,040
37 for six years now

1059
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:26,400
Well, it was a good run. It was indeed

1060
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:34,160
This is so much. I forgot how actually hard this game is. I know I can't get super hard and I'm terrible at puzzles

1061
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:36,160
so

1062
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:40,400
I'm trying to remember stuff, but then I'm like, yeah, this one's safe. Then I ran in and died

1063
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:45,360
Wait, this one's yellow and there's only two directions we can go. They're both

1064
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:47,120
They're both

1065
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:51,840
Why do they do this to us? I'll shoot this one

1066
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:54,160
Oh

1067
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:56,160
I almost walked into that

1068
01:25:56,560 --> 01:26:00,560
I think it's your one. I think I'm gonna take this one. I almost backed up into that

1069
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:02,960
Don't go in the middle. All right

1070
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:06,720
I don't know what kind of death it is though

1071
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:12,720
Oh, wait. No, no, no get out. Oh, okay. Get back out. Get back out. We gotta wait for him to despawn

1072
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:17,280
Did you just like come to daddy

1073
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:23,360
Wait, did he really? Oh, he's not like it went up. I thought come to daddy

1074
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:31,200
Still doing stuff. Oh, okay. We good green

1075
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:35,840
Yeah, this one's good. It should be safe in both directions

1076
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,800
Let me check what color this one is. This one is

1077
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:45,920
Yellow. Okay. They're both yellow. Yeah. Oh, I didn't throw that properly. I'll try. I'll test it. Oh, no

1078
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:48,160
Why did you run it?

1079
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:50,240
I thought it was safe

1080
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:53,680
No

1081
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:59,040
I thought it was safe for you. I missed I missed judge you did it by mistake

1082
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,840
I missed the shoe throw

1083
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:04,640
No

1084
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:12,720
Oh, there's a dude in here. I'm just gonna speed run. No

1085
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:22,640
Okay, we'll see if we can find it this time. I don't think we've passed with only one of us alive yet. No, actually, no. Yeah, you're right

1086
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:25,600
Um

1087
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:30,080
You never know might be my moment a time to redeem myself

1088
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:33,680
Oh, that was oh

1089
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:35,440
well

1090
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:37,680
Imagine I went in that one and I would have been slimed

1091
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:43,120
Wish I could kill you and use your body

1092
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:51,840
Yellow and yellow

1093
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:58,240
Yeah, maybe that one's all right. Okay. Okay. We're we're we're making progress. I think out of this

1094
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:05,280
Hopefully this one's yellow, which means I think this could be a danger. Yeah, you're right. Okay

1095
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:12,400
Um, but it could be an orange in here. So it might be livable if necessary. Yeah. Yeah. Well, let's try this one

1096
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:19,200
Sounds like someone's peeing in there. I think this one should also be livable. I mean it it might be

1097
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:24,160
It should be a subtle tap. What is that? What is that?

1098
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:29,920
It's the oh, that was that was oh, that's the cross laser. Okay. Okay. You did that one before

1099
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:34,960
It sounds like a goose

1100
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:41,840
All right, what about this? Um, this one's yellow, which means too

1101
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:47,520
You got this

1102
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:55,840
I got time. I got time. Oh my god another pink. Oh, oh god. Okay. Um, well you found one of them

1103
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:00,480
Please take a gamble

1104
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:02,640
You can get the one in front of you or the one behind you

1105
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:05,200
Oh picked the one in front of you

1106
01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:11,200
You picked correctly. You picked incorrectly. Wait. No, that's only the middle. Actually, that's fine. Okay. We're good

1107
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:15,440
We're good. That's not that bad. Yeah. Okay. What if I go

1108
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:16,800
Oh

1109
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:20,080
Wait, isn't this not the right direction though? Because it's yellow

1110
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:22,640
uh

1111
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:24,960
Yeah, yeah

1112
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:28,640
Come on you can backtrack

1113
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:31,600
Oh, I'm going the wrong way

1114
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:35,200
I keep messing up my sense of direction

1115
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:43,040
Or if I go in the center, wait, no, that's not where I wanted to go

1116
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:50,000
Actually, let's go in here. Wait. No, I can't. I'm trapped in the center

1117
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:54,640
Let's hope. Do I have a shoe? Do I have no shoes?

1118
01:29:58,160 --> 01:30:00,160
Okay

1119
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:02,800
Okay, one of these doors is safe. Good luck

1120
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:08,960
Let's test my luck. I'm putting it all in luck. Let's say that's green. That's bad

1121
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:11,600
I hear water

1122
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:14,400
Yeah, I think that's the acid still going

1123
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:17,280
Oh, that was my dead body. Okay, let's swimming

1124
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:27,280
Let's try this. Let's try. Let's try it. We'll beat. We'll beat. We'll beat. Did that count?

1125
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:30,560
Oh, oh, okay

1126
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:34,400
Wait, you picked it. Oh my god. Oh my god

1127
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:37,360
We're baiting

1128
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:40,320
Master baiting. I mean wait

1129
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:45,840
Um anyways

1130
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:50,960
This actually might be fine

1131
01:30:55,680 --> 01:30:59,680
I mean the room is green so only one direction is dangerous. Okay

1132
01:30:59,680 --> 01:31:01,680
Okay

1133
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:03,520
Okay

1134
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:08,160
Okay, all right. Not bad. Okay. Once again only one of these is dangerous

1135
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:11,040
Let's see if this is the one

1136
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:16,720
Yo

1137
01:31:16,720 --> 01:31:19,360
What's happening here? Wait, she's doing it

1138
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:22,960
Which way should I go?

1139
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:25,520
Blue I feel like this is a trap

1140
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:31,920
Iced again

1141
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:35,440
I don't look at the door

1142
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:40,640
Yeah, there's so many things to remember. Oh, I never look at the door

1143
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:46,480
No

1144
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:52,160
How could this happen to me? CB2 ice three

1145
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:54,160
I

1146
01:31:55,360 --> 01:32:02,240
Think I've been slimed as much as you've been iced. Yeah, so my enemy is ice yours is slime. Mm-hmm

1147
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:08,640
All right, Elsa versus slime girl. Ooh

1148
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:14,320
Actually, I remember I remember uh

1149
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:19,040
Uh, no, no, no, no. I got him. Why am I so bad with names?

1150
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,440
He just ran around me in the circle. You were thinking honey. Yes, honey

1151
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:28,400
You did a character design for the next round and she said no slime girl. Yeah, she hates slime girls. Oh

1152
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:30,880
I was gonna explode

1153
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:32,880
scared

1154
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:35,360
Oh, yeah, no, she's she's she's anti slime girl

1155
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:41,840
I don't think they can be cute. Oh, it's it's oh, yeah, they're awesome

1156
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:45,520
And I like the like what they can like kind of shape shift and stuff

1157
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:53,840
Hmm, um, but in terms of like rigging and making art outside, there's only like I only know like two slime v-tubers

1158
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:56,560
So it's like pretty difficult to get that effect

1159
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:04,800
What my like oh my god. Oh, we have another one my stream mascot thing is one small slimes

1160
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:07,280
Oh, so we got two shoes. Hold on

1161
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,320
Okay, I'm gonna mark it. Oh, what do you want?

1162
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:13,440
Is it this one?

1163
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:15,520
Uh, what color is this room?

1164
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:19,440
I'll test it in this room

1165
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:21,680
Oh, I heard something

1166
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:23,680
Oh, that's the eyes

1167
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:27,280
Or like the center when it makes that noise it does that

1168
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:32,640
It it was something in the middle, but I don't know what that was. Yeah, I don't know. It's like some

1169
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:35,840
Anti matter junk

1170
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:38,320
Well, it's gone out sweet

1171
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:41,040
Wait, maybe we should go straight instead

1172
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:46,720
I think all directions should be good. Nope, except that one. Oh, that's purple

1173
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:51,360
I don't like the purple rooms. Oh, no

1174
01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:56,080
This one was green, right? Yeah, okay. Yeah

1175
01:33:57,680 --> 01:34:00,720
Oh, wait, we just I got an achievement. You did

1176
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:06,800
Yeah, I think this is gonna play before it says I've discovered 300 rooms. Jesus christ

1177
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:10,880
That's right when I played 10 years ago. I think I was playing this alone

1178
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:13,840
Oh

1179
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:16,720
Wait, oh, we have to go in his room. Go in there. I'm going there. I

1180
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:22,880
I forget that I can run. Yeah, that's I forgot that that could be a thing that he just spawns in

1181
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:28,880
Yeah, and then he takes your room. So you just have no choice but to move forward. Oh dang. That's intense

1182
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:34,800
Oh, oh, I got a danger danger guy. Oh, what the heck? Um, I'll boot behind him though

1183
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:38,800
I

1184
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:40,800
I need eight years to

1185
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:43,840
I didn't think that was something that could happen

1186
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:50,560
That's so funny. I'll go back and get the other boot in a minute. Let me boot this reverse. Okay

1187
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:54,480
Wait, something in the middle. Careful in the middle

1188
01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:58,400
What is that?

1189
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:04,960
All right dark matter dark matter moment. I don't actually know what dark matter is

1190
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:10,880
Something about space. I think did you get the boots? Oh, you did

1191
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:15,520
Uh, I've got one. There's another one. Oh, oh, no

1192
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:20,640
Okay, we have to backtrack and I think I'm gonna go back and get that boot. Hey, what's happening in this room?

1193
01:35:20,640 --> 01:35:22,640
I hope the chainsaw man's gone

1194
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:25,120
I bet he is

1195
01:35:25,120 --> 01:35:32,560
Do you remember which room the boot was in? No. Oh, this is this is the floor is lava. What but I could totally get my boot back

1196
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:34,720
Let me in

1197
01:35:34,720 --> 01:35:37,920
Oh, I found it. Okay. I've got my boot. My boot is fine. I'll come back

1198
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:43,600
All right, should we should we go up?

1199
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:49,600
Yeah, we can try to go this way. I think this one's safe, but I'm gonna boot it just in case because uh,

1200
01:35:50,160 --> 01:35:52,160
Oh, it is purple though

1201
01:35:53,120 --> 01:35:54,960
Are you safe?

1202
01:35:54,960 --> 01:36:00,800
Oh, no, but I mean, uh, which one was this the orange one is this this is okay. I think right. Yeah

1203
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:09,360
Um, yeah, I think this is the room that I don't remember actually try it. I think this way should be dangerous

1204
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:14,560
Uh, uh, uh, yeah, this one's guaranteed. Let's backtrack

1205
01:36:17,120 --> 01:36:21,200
No, I don't like those directions. They're very dangerous. Wait, wait, look at the boot

1206
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:24,880
You have to pick it up. You have to press yeah

1207
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:28,800
Nifty boots back. Let's go. Perfect

1208
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:31,760
Um, which color is this room?

1209
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:34,400
All right, I'm gonna boot it

1210
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:40,240
I'm feeling good. Okay. We just have to find the safe way

1211
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
I'll boot it this time

1212
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:50,640
Oh, that's not bad. We can wait. Yeah, we can wait for that one. Goodbye shoe. I could have grabbed my shoe

1213
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
Maybe we're too late now

1214
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:57,280
No

1215
01:36:57,360 --> 01:37:00,480
Dang it. This one's green. Oh laser

1216
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:03,920
I almost got iced

1217
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:05,920
Not the ice

1218
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:10,400
Uh, one of these should be technically safe

1219
01:37:13,680 --> 01:37:17,920
Boot uh, well, okay. This way is good. This one

1220
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:22,480
This way is good. Um, I'll meet you over there

1221
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:26,800
So that I can mark this one as well

1222
01:37:28,240 --> 01:37:30,240
Nifty look at us

1223
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:35,920
Well, let's try I only have one boot again. Oh, you do why so do I?

1224
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:39,360
Yeah, uh, what's this one?

1225
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:44,960
This one's green. This one's yellow. Let me grab my shoe. We can go that way

1226
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:48,800
Hello, I think both are good

1227
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:52,080
Let's go to the green room

1228
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:54,480
safer

1229
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:56,480
Can I grab it? All right, I did

1230
01:37:57,520 --> 01:38:04,560
This one. Oh, no. Oh, no. Um, I made a mistake. I thought this room was safe

1231
01:38:07,200 --> 01:38:14,080
I can't miscalculate. I trust my own judgment too much. Oh, but honestly your judgment's like pretty accurate like

1232
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:17,520
80% of the time so I don't blame you for that

1233
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:23,280
Let's try it. Let's try I have one boot to my name. Yep

1234
01:38:25,120 --> 01:38:27,120
All right

1235
01:38:28,160 --> 01:38:30,160
I can't do

1236
01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:38,880
Quick maths blue let's go for it. I don't know. That'd be good if it's blue

1237
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:46,160
Okay, that means all directions are safe then. All right. The exit could be outside of one of these maybe

1238
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:48,800
I'm hoping

1239
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:52,960
Well, I feel like the exit's probably not in the room with the guy probably not

1240
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:55,200
That was suck for it

1241
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:57,360
Otherwise, he's just stupid

1242
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Oh

1243
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:02,560
I saw it that time

1244
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:06,080
Not this time. Not this time. Nice try

1245
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:08,480
buddy

1246
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:10,480
Nice try open the freaking door

1247
01:39:11,680 --> 01:39:13,680
I'm getting I'm getting spun around

1248
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:20,640
Okay, this one both directions are dangerous. I don't know for two directions

1249
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:23,120
Let me go this way just in case

1250
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:26,320
Yeah, that way it might be but

1251
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:30,800
Oh, it's blue. Oh wait. That's great. That means it's safe completely

1252
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:33,440
You hit the corners

1253
01:39:33,440 --> 01:39:35,440
Let's check the corner carefully doors

1254
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:37,760
Oh

1255
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:42,960
Oh the thing it's blue shut the door close the door

1256
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:46,320
Okay

1257
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:49,040
Oh

1258
01:39:49,360 --> 01:39:51,520
Well now you guys got up. I just I'm just stuck

1259
01:39:53,680 --> 01:39:57,520
It's wait room. Are you little there now? All right

1260
01:40:01,200 --> 01:40:05,120
I mean this room. Oh, I mean it's a room that if you want to walk through would have been fine

1261
01:40:06,720 --> 01:40:08,720
Um, what was that?

1262
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:12,880
It was ice again. I just walked by it. I didn't even care

1263
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:15,600
I mean they're trying to ice me

1264
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:18,080
They really are they're trying to get me

1265
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:23,440
Let's see. Where should I go? I'm trying to freeze some rabbit fur the window

1266
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:33,440
Oh my gosh, there's literally like a good chunk of the map we haven't gotten to yet. Yeah seven by seven is a lot bigger

1267
01:40:34,160 --> 01:40:36,160
We uh, we

1268
01:40:36,240 --> 01:40:39,440
We've done like two first one third

1269
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:44,320
Oh, come on, bro. Oh, is he gonna kill him?

1270
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:47,920
He just killed that man. Oh, no

1271
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:56,240
That one's safe, but you're just gonna be carefully going in the right direction. Oh wait. No, no, it's not. No, it's not

1272
01:40:57,120 --> 01:40:59,120
Help

1273
01:41:00,240 --> 01:41:05,920
Maybe oh my gosh, how did I just am I good you guessed correctly? Wow

1274
01:41:07,120 --> 01:41:09,120
I'm maxing out on luck

1275
01:41:09,680 --> 01:41:11,680
Oh

1276
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:15,120
You have to go in his room. Why is this keep happening?

1277
01:41:15,920 --> 01:41:17,920
They're forcing you into them

1278
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:23,040
Oh my god, I thought he was still behind me. Okay, that's yellow

1279
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:25,040
This room is green, so

1280
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:29,280
Only one is dangerous out of the two that you have available

1281
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:32,960
Or you can backtrack

1282
01:41:34,720 --> 01:41:38,480
If you still have a boot you do still have a boot. I do I still have a boot. You're right. I do still have a boot

1283
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:43,360
There's something about this that I think is good

1284
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:47,280
Yeah

1285
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:49,280
lucky

1286
01:41:50,160 --> 01:41:55,520
Let's keep moving forward. All right, so um two out of the three that you haven't checked in this room are deadly

1287
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:00,800
And I think you just found the lucky one

1288
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:03,920
Okay

1289
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:07,040
And this one's blue so they should be all safe, but they can still have door traps

1290
01:42:07,120 --> 01:42:09,520
Oh, yeah, I should probably stand so close to the door

1291
01:42:14,640 --> 01:42:16,640
Okay, yellow again

1292
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:22,720
Can I get like a green yellow again? Oh, they're all yellow

1293
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:28,880
God damn. Um, you probably want to avoid ending up in the corner. I guess yeah, I'll go down

1294
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:34,560
But other rooms are safe so you could label them as safe

1295
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:40,720
Is there a dude in this room? Hello? Hey, are you good?

1296
01:42:42,640 --> 01:42:46,560
Oh, I heard something. I think the middle's dangerous. Yeah the middle again. Oh

1297
01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:50,640
Oh, goodbye. I hope I didn't slime my shoe

1298
01:42:52,240 --> 01:42:54,240
I think it's good

1299
01:42:55,040 --> 01:42:57,040
Oh, thank god, excuse me, bro

1300
01:42:58,240 --> 01:43:00,240
All right

1301
01:43:00,720 --> 01:43:05,520
This one should be safe because the one next to it was blue. I'm just trying to get the green

1302
01:43:07,200 --> 01:43:09,200
Oh

1303
01:43:14,640 --> 01:43:16,800
We did it. Well, you did most of it at the end

1304
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:19,120
Yeah

1305
01:43:19,120 --> 01:43:21,120
I sacrificed myself

1306
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:24,080
Up was only with your sacrifice that I could

1307
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:26,960
Move forward. Thank you

1308
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:30,480
A pleasure

1309
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:33,840
My tomagotchi's still dying

1310
01:43:34,720 --> 01:43:39,360
Oh, no, you didn't even take a moment to feed him. I had to clean up his poop a moment in my my one

1311
01:43:39,680 --> 01:43:41,680
I need to like google why

1312
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:46,160
It has gray clouds around it. Is it the super depressed? I don't

1313
01:43:47,680 --> 01:43:49,680
Well, I don't think my one can do that

1314
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:55,840
Tomagotchi, I know that you had like uh, you have one of the colored ones. Yeah, the uni

1315
01:43:56,320 --> 01:44:00,000
Oh, I want to get one of those now. Oh, I have to clean with

1316
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:03,600
The vacuum

1317
01:44:04,160 --> 01:44:07,760
There's a vacuum. Yeah, there's a vacuum robot

1318
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:16,480
I had no idea I've I want to I want to get an uni. I want to get the hollow live one as well

1319
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:20,320
I know the hollow live one's already sold out

1320
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:26,800
Yeah, maybe next time I go to japan I could find a second hand one. That's true. You can get the um

1321
01:44:27,680 --> 01:44:30,320
You can get the wigs though with the code

1322
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:36,480
Oh, really? Yeah, that's why I have um my tomagotchi dressed up as pekara

1323
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:40,720
I thought you had the hollow live one because you had the wig

1324
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:47,440
No, it comes out in 2025. That'd be sick if I just randomly was I'm hella sponsored stream

1325
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:55,360
It's very very privileged early access. Yep. I'm just you know, I'm just built different whole year advanced

1326
01:44:56,320 --> 01:45:02,320
You think I feel like you wouldn't be allowed to take pictures of it actually, you know, yeah, that's that is true

1327
01:45:03,280 --> 01:45:09,120
Status, okay. I need to feed you like two more times and then you will hopefully stop being depressed

1328
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:14,480
Have some have have a you know what have some somen noodles

1329
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:19,760
All right

1330
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:22,880
Let's do this. This will probably be my last one

1331
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:27,600
We'll give it a our best go

1332
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:32,160
I can't believe she'd be would sacrifice the cat girl. No

1333
01:45:33,680 --> 01:45:39,840
It's sacrifice sacrifice myself. It's okay. That's different. Oh, that's green. I'm gonna shoot it

1334
01:45:42,640 --> 01:45:44,640
It's unsafe

1335
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:49,120
You know what? Let's just go to that one. There's a guy. There's a guy. Oh great. There's a guy

1336
01:45:49,520 --> 01:45:57,600
Hey, which model are you this time you oh, you're you're the bold guy again. You are an old gray man

1337
01:45:58,720 --> 01:46:02,800
Why am I always the old man? Oh, that's like that. Maybe like the second time

1338
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:05,920
I think this one should be dangerous

1339
01:46:07,280 --> 01:46:12,560
Because the floor is green and we're in a corner. Oh, that's a good point track actually. Yeah

1340
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:16,080
There's another room that was green every which one it was

1341
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:19,040
So that one

1342
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:22,640
Oh, they say this one's yellow. Okay. It was this one that was green then

1343
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:25,760
Hopefully this one's safe. Yeah. Oh

1344
01:46:27,040 --> 01:46:29,040
Good thing we double shoot it to make sure

1345
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:31,760
Yeah

1346
01:46:33,440 --> 01:46:38,960
Careful the middle still yeah, because it seems like it's really late. It doesn't check check it out. Oh, no

1347
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:43,760
Oh, I just heard something. Oh my god. What was that? Oh nice try

1348
01:46:44,320 --> 01:46:50,800
Well, I see in the middle. They always get ice try even. Yeah, this one should be safe. Yeah

1349
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:57,200
Oh, this one's green so it should be safe in both directions. Uh,

1350
01:46:58,240 --> 01:47:02,480
I'll see what color this one is. This one is green. I'll boot it. Is that one good?

1351
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:05,760
Yeah, okay, let's do that one then

1352
01:47:07,360 --> 01:47:09,360
Mine was yellow

1353
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:12,960
Okay, look at us. We're like master master gamers at this now

1354
01:47:14,080 --> 01:47:15,280
Oh

1355
01:47:15,280 --> 01:47:17,280
You can speed run it

1356
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:20,160
Try to trigger the middle. Uh, that's where we go

1357
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:23,760
So one of these is dangerous. Uh

1358
01:47:25,280 --> 01:47:27,280
A pink one probably is

1359
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:30,720
Oh

1360
01:47:30,720 --> 01:47:33,760
That means that the room we are in

1361
01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:38,640
Is the only safe room attached to those so maybe we backtrack. Okay

1362
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:42,560
What color was this one?

1363
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:48,480
All right, so this one is dangerous. However, it could be it could be survivable. So I'm gonna throw something in it

1364
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:51,120
boop

1365
01:47:51,120 --> 01:47:53,120
Oh, what are you good toss

1366
01:47:54,080 --> 01:47:56,080
What are you? Oh, no, no

1367
01:48:00,080 --> 01:48:02,720
Um, I mean it's survivable

1368
01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:05,920
But we'd have to run

1369
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:07,920
Directly at the door you want to go through

1370
01:48:08,640 --> 01:48:15,120
Oh, okay. Um, do you want to try over here then? I mean, sorry over wait. No. Yeah, we gotta run

1371
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:19,600
It's it's it's one out of three. I don't know. I'm I'm taking the risk

1372
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:23,120
I'm gonna do it

1373
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:25,760
I'm going I'm going to this way

1374
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:28,880
Okay, I'll go I'll go the right one. I'll go the right one

1375
01:48:33,040 --> 01:48:37,120
I'm good. It was it's uh, it's it's not the right one. Oh, it wasn't

1376
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:40,880
Nope

1377
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:43,520
Nice

1378
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:46,320
Oh my god

1379
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:51,280
Impressive, which one was that one? I don't I don't have any boots. Love. I got boots. Don't you worry

1380
01:48:52,720 --> 01:48:54,720
Oh

1381
01:48:55,680 --> 01:48:57,680
Poggers

1382
01:49:00,640 --> 01:49:05,600
Professionals we are so gorgeous

1383
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:08,560
Incredible

1384
01:49:12,640 --> 01:49:17,920
Wait, what are they what are they doing? I wish I could see past the screen what their little dance was

1385
01:49:20,080 --> 01:49:22,720
Like how you have no shoes and I have shoes

1386
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:29,600
Okay, one more one more one more. Yeah, that was really fast. That was fast. We speed run we can we can be all right

1387
01:49:30,720 --> 01:49:32,720
All right, let's see. I'll test this

1388
01:49:33,440 --> 01:49:39,200
Oh, hello exploding, dude. Thanks for the free boost. I'll take it appreciate it big preach

1389
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:42,480
Oh, I think I might have messed up my boot girl

1390
01:49:45,120 --> 01:49:47,840
It kind of you you you took his shoe that was there though

1391
01:49:50,160 --> 01:49:54,420
It's like a it's a boot transfer now it's in the now it's in the doorway

1392
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Wait, I'll test oh

1393
01:49:58,240 --> 01:50:00,240
I

1394
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:03,680
Yeah, this one's green kind of see what happens when I touch him

1395
01:50:04,640 --> 01:50:06,640
I just died

1396
01:50:07,520 --> 01:50:09,520
I know I die, but how do I die?

1397
01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:12,480
but

1398
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:14,480
Oh

1399
01:50:14,480 --> 01:50:17,440
Yeah, I'm I'm I'm trained. Oh, that's so smart rooms

1400
01:50:18,080 --> 01:50:21,760
Yeah, I think that's actually like kind of like the move for me when you get those

1401
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:25,440
But that's what they intend for it to do. They don't have to waste it. Yeah

1402
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:31,440
This one's also green. Yeah, and then you don't have to backtrack. Oh ice ice. Oh fire

1403
01:50:34,080 --> 01:50:36,080
And I said fire

1404
01:50:37,280 --> 01:50:39,280
To the cat girl

1405
01:50:43,280 --> 01:50:44,880
All right, there's a guy in here i'm gonna boot it

1406
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
I'm gonna grab the other boot

1407
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:50,880
I'll get in here

1408
01:50:51,360 --> 01:50:53,360
He's got crushed in the door

1409
01:50:55,680 --> 01:50:57,680
I

1410
01:50:58,080 --> 01:51:00,080
Thought Bruce I can with the screen we might have died

1411
01:51:01,200 --> 01:51:03,040
Sorry

1412
01:51:03,040 --> 01:51:08,480
All right, one of these directions is bad. I'm gonna go this is a blue this one. I found it. It's this one

1413
01:51:09,360 --> 01:51:11,360
We cannot we can go through this one. It's safe

1414
01:51:12,720 --> 01:51:15,520
But still be careful of the middle. I never trust the middle same

1415
01:51:16,320 --> 01:51:18,320
Hey, this one's blue that should be good

1416
01:51:18,720 --> 01:51:23,360
Um, do you want to go? I'll check. I'll check. Oh, we got a toxic skill in man

1417
01:51:23,600 --> 01:51:25,600
He'd be toxic

1418
01:51:28,560 --> 01:51:31,200
It's kind of a cool animation. Well, I'm not gonna lie

1419
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:34,800
Oh

1420
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:37,200
The little explosion kind of gets me every time

1421
01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:43,840
All right, this one's blue. Nice. Yeah

1422
01:51:46,880 --> 01:51:50,480
Oh, it should be good in either directions

1423
01:51:51,440 --> 01:51:58,400
Hmm, you just gotta pick which one we want to go through. Okay, they're both green. I'll just clear the corner

1424
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:03,040
I'll go through this one

1425
01:52:03,440 --> 01:52:05,440
Come on

1426
01:52:05,920 --> 01:52:11,760
Yeah, you know as i'm sitting here drinking and getting myself so you guys know that shabby also has a code

1427
01:52:12,160 --> 01:52:14,160
Oh my gosh, what's your coach?

1428
01:52:15,200 --> 01:52:19,840
My coach fool. Your coach fool. My coach shabby. What a coincidence

1429
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:22,480
Oh

1430
01:52:22,720 --> 01:52:24,560
I lost my shoe

1431
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:27,040
Sadly, uh, yeah, I can see that I can see the death in there

1432
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:29,920
I'm um

1433
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:34,720
I'm drinking gamer subs right now as we speak. I'm drinking some lean

1434
01:52:36,560 --> 01:52:40,080
I am kind of drinking cold pee. Um, yeah

1435
01:52:43,200 --> 01:52:45,200
Okay, this one's safe. Um

1436
01:52:45,520 --> 01:52:46,640
Um

1437
01:52:46,640 --> 01:52:52,240
But the room adjacent to it this way is definitely not safe, but it could be it could be orange

1438
01:52:53,200 --> 01:52:55,200
So I kind of want to test it

1439
01:52:56,720 --> 01:52:58,720
Huh, what?

1440
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:03,680
Uh, but this room's great. It should be should be deadly. That's weird. Wait, does that mean?

1441
01:53:04,640 --> 01:53:07,280
Maybe it's the middle. Maybe it's the middle. It must be the middle

1442
01:53:08,080 --> 01:53:12,800
Yeah, I'll I'll run in. I'll run in. I'll look I'll test it with my body here. Have my shoe just in case

1443
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:15,760
I'm almost gonna come in. Oh, look it up

1444
01:53:18,320 --> 01:53:20,320
I figured out what it was

1445
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:29,520
Did you get your shoe back? Okay, good. I did. Yeah chainsaw man looks different from what I remember in the end of the day

1446
01:53:33,840 --> 01:53:39,040
Okay, okay, cool. Cool. I wish he would leave a shoe. I'll be great

1447
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:47,360
All right, let me test this one. I'm feeling good about this run boot. All right. Well, I figured out which way it was

1448
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
Uh, other boot

1449
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,800
All right, this one should be safe. Is there a guy laughing here? Okay

1450
01:53:56,400 --> 01:54:01,520
Uh, this one's green. So it should be that the room came from was was it? Oh purple

1451
01:54:02,640 --> 01:54:06,560
Please be something good. Okay. Yellow manageable

1452
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:10,800
Yeah, yellow is tolerable careful of the middle though. Yeah

1453
01:54:12,080 --> 01:54:14,080
Oh, we're good. Um

1454
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:19,920
Hoping this one could be orange. That's what we need. We need this blue

1455
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:27,920
Okay, so this room should be a trap, but it should be a safe trap. Okay. Oh great

1456
01:54:30,320 --> 01:54:33,680
Did I grab it? No, I thought I grabbed it

1457
01:54:34,320 --> 01:54:39,920
Maybe it lived. Maybe it lived. Hopefully it lived either way. You'll get a boot. Oh, I got a free boot, right? Yeah

1458
01:54:40,400 --> 01:54:42,400
Oh, that's too bad. That's good

1459
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:46,880
Oh

1460
01:54:47,360 --> 01:54:51,520
Please be green or blue. Okay, yellow yellow

1461
01:54:53,360 --> 01:54:56,960
Manageable wait, this it should be safe because but the middle can still be dangerous

1462
01:54:57,760 --> 01:54:59,760
I'm not safe and marked itself

1463
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:03,760
Okay, this room is yellow. So this is green could have it

1464
01:55:04,480 --> 01:55:07,760
All right, uh, thank you misty boot. I know I kind of did

1465
01:55:09,920 --> 01:55:13,440
I think it's good. Oh, yeah, I think my room's the deadly one then

1466
01:55:15,120 --> 01:55:17,120
I won't bother testing it

1467
01:55:18,480 --> 01:55:23,840
You should go you should still go into the purple rooms if you know they're safe in case the exit spawns. Oh, that's a good point

1468
01:55:24,880 --> 01:55:26,880
That's true. That's a good point

1469
01:55:27,520 --> 01:55:32,880
We didn't know they were safe, but we can check it. Yeah, we can go back and check it back and check. Yeah

1470
01:55:33,840 --> 01:55:37,360
We got boots. Yeah boots because that would be funny if wait, which one was it

1471
01:55:38,640 --> 01:55:43,200
Be funny if we just like ran past and exit because we were scared of the purple room. Yeah

1472
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:46,160
Oh, it should be this one

1473
01:55:49,120 --> 01:55:52,960
All right, let me check watch it be green. It's not the exit. That'd be so funny though. All right

1474
01:55:57,840 --> 01:56:01,440
There right though, I would see purple and I'm like nope

1475
01:56:02,880 --> 01:56:04,880
I'm not even gonna bother

1476
01:56:05,280 --> 01:56:08,320
That's scary. I'm scared of the color purple

1477
01:56:10,640 --> 01:56:12,640
Purple guy

1478
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:15,440
I'll test this room in the boot

1479
01:56:16,080 --> 01:56:17,600
up

1480
01:56:17,600 --> 01:56:19,600
Mine's a bad one

1481
01:56:20,560 --> 01:56:23,040
This doesn't help too much. It's a corner. Oh, no

1482
01:56:23,920 --> 01:56:26,800
That is a blue corner. Oh, hello. Hello, sir

1483
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:29,120
I would

1484
01:56:29,120 --> 01:56:31,120
Gladly give you a hug

1485
01:56:33,120 --> 01:56:35,120
What a handsome dapper gentlemen

1486
01:56:36,320 --> 01:56:37,600
Oh

1487
01:56:37,600 --> 01:56:41,200
And he's gone. Oh, he's looking at me. Hi. I wish I could crouch

1488
01:56:44,400 --> 01:56:50,240
Okay, this is green. So I think I think the sleigh should be safe. Yeah, because that one's the red

1489
01:56:50,480 --> 01:56:52,480
I'll still oh careful

1490
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
Ha ha

1491
01:56:59,360 --> 01:57:03,680
You thought you could get us with the flamethrower wrong we're ultimate gamers

1492
01:57:06,320 --> 01:57:08,320
Okay, this one should be safe, but I'm gonna boot it. Okay

1493
01:57:08,960 --> 01:57:10,960
save

1494
01:57:10,960 --> 01:57:16,800
Green oh wait, it should be safe again for both directions because yeah, that one I lied it should be one dangerous

1495
01:57:17,120 --> 01:57:19,120
Yeah, I'll put this one. I don't have a boot

1496
01:57:19,920 --> 01:57:21,920
This one's I think it's on safe

1497
01:57:22,640 --> 01:57:24,640
Let's do it

1498
01:57:24,640 --> 01:57:26,640
Oh, it's just middle. It's the middle

1499
01:57:27,440 --> 01:57:29,440
middle

1500
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:30,880
Slime

1501
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:32,880
Nice try

1502
01:57:33,040 --> 01:57:36,480
Uh, I'll check the other room. I thought you're about to walk into the slime. No

1503
01:57:37,440 --> 01:57:39,440
I don't want to get slimed again that badly

1504
01:57:40,320 --> 01:57:42,320
All right, I'll check this room

1505
01:57:42,400 --> 01:57:44,400
Not the exit. Okay

1506
01:57:44,640 --> 01:57:51,040
Um, um, um, let me see this room. This is Jason's theory. No, I'll meet you halfway. It's yellow

1507
01:57:52,240 --> 01:57:54,240
Oh

1508
01:57:54,480 --> 01:57:57,920
That means this should be this should be trapped. Okay

1509
01:57:58,960 --> 01:58:02,560
Because uh, it only has two directions, right? Yes

1510
01:58:03,440 --> 01:58:05,440
This one's green over here

1511
01:58:05,920 --> 01:58:07,920
And this one's green. I'm gonna bait

1512
01:58:09,360 --> 01:58:15,360
Oh, I found a purple room. Oh, uh, goodbye cruel worlds. Oh, no, did you die?

1513
01:58:17,040 --> 01:58:20,400
Uh, I'm in the process. I'm gonna die from lava

1514
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:26,960
I'm I'm screaming the floor is lava. Although I'm standing on a non lava patch

1515
01:58:30,480 --> 01:58:32,480
Uh, turns out this room is safe

1516
01:58:37,360 --> 01:58:38,400
No

1517
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:40,400
Okay, you have to carry

1518
01:58:40,640 --> 01:58:44,560
I I got this. What color is the room you died in? Uh, I don't recall

1519
01:58:45,360 --> 01:58:49,040
Purple. I think it was purple. I think it was yellow

1520
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
I got this

1521
01:58:54,320 --> 01:58:56,320
Okay, okay, okay zooming

1522
01:58:59,360 --> 01:59:02,320
Oh, okay, this one's green. Um, but

1523
01:59:03,600 --> 01:59:11,360
Okay, that's all I find. I want my boot. I want my boot. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Gamer shats. Yeah

1524
01:59:14,160 --> 01:59:16,160
I can walk through here now though

1525
01:59:16,800 --> 01:59:18,800
So loud

1526
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:23,040
Okay, let's just be safe now

1527
01:59:24,640 --> 01:59:27,440
Um, it's green. Let me see

1528
01:59:29,440 --> 01:59:31,440
What about the room that was right past you?

1529
01:59:32,640 --> 01:59:34,160
Um

1530
01:59:34,160 --> 01:59:36,160
yellow, which means

1531
01:59:36,640 --> 01:59:42,560
In a CR corner that the corner over there means that it means that corner is safe. Let me check this one

1532
01:59:43,440 --> 01:59:51,680
Green which means the room I'm in is the only dangerous one. Okay. I'm gonna check it. Oh come on. Oh, no

1533
01:59:53,520 --> 01:59:55,520
Okay, um, I'm just gonna

1534
01:59:56,400 --> 01:59:58,400
I believe in you

1535
02:00:05,280 --> 02:00:09,360
Oh, what if this corn is the ending that would be crazy that would be so crazy

1536
02:00:12,720 --> 02:00:17,600
Oh, okay. Gotta do some backtracking. I want you to speedrun this though

1537
02:00:23,120 --> 02:00:26,480
Yeet. I'm gonna have this door opening closing sounds of my nightmares

1538
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:29,520
Uh, yeah

1539
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:35,040
Okay, green. I gotta see if I can find the movie that this game is kind of based on

1540
02:00:35,680 --> 02:00:38,960
Yeah, I don't want to watch it now. I mean this one's purple

1541
02:00:39,680 --> 02:00:42,480
So that should be something. Uh, what's this one?

1542
02:00:48,160 --> 02:00:53,200
Uh, that means this one should also be a trap. I just don't know which I could get running now eat

1543
02:00:54,320 --> 02:00:56,320
Oh, okay

1544
02:00:56,720 --> 02:00:58,960
The middle is tolerable. Yeah, it was good

1545
02:01:00,960 --> 02:01:02,960
Good old middle trap

1546
02:01:03,520 --> 02:01:05,520
I'd really like a new boot

1547
02:01:05,760 --> 02:01:08,560
I know we need a guy to come run at you

1548
02:01:09,520 --> 02:01:11,520
Yeah, I need someone to explode at me

1549
02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:15,600
Okay, these should be safe because it is green

1550
02:01:17,040 --> 02:01:19,040
Okay pink

1551
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:21,760
Purple

1552
02:01:21,760 --> 02:01:23,760
Yeah, I just wanted to mark it. Okay

1553
02:01:25,040 --> 02:01:27,040
Let me see your destruction

1554
02:01:28,880 --> 02:01:32,640
Oh, I didn't go in this one. Maybe there was a specific reason why I didn't

1555
02:01:33,600 --> 02:01:37,200
Just in case I'll check this one. Sorry. I think that you knew that one was a trap

1556
02:01:38,240 --> 02:01:41,520
If I could recall correctly because the other room was like

1557
02:01:43,360 --> 02:01:46,560
And I know this one's a trap. I should mark it. I'm gonna mark it. Oh

1558
02:01:47,920 --> 02:01:51,680
All right, if I know that one's a trap then this should be safe, right mind sleeper rules

1559
02:01:52,080 --> 02:01:56,880
Hopefully the last time I thought the last time I thought this I ran and died. So let's see if I did that again. Oh

1560
02:01:59,120 --> 02:02:01,120
Pretty good

1561
02:02:03,040 --> 02:02:07,200
Oh, yeah, uh, wait, I want to check what color the room that I was marking is

1562
02:02:10,240 --> 02:02:12,800
What what color is this one this one is

1563
02:02:16,160 --> 02:02:22,960
Green oh, okay. Um, if that's green and I have two of these exits marked

1564
02:02:24,400 --> 02:02:27,360
Then there is a 50 50 chance that that room is dangerous

1565
02:02:29,120 --> 02:02:31,120
Are you gonna take the chance?

1566
02:02:33,120 --> 02:02:36,320
As long as I just have a wall, you're fine. Oh

1567
02:02:38,320 --> 02:02:40,320
I think you're good

1568
02:02:41,840 --> 02:02:43,840
She's doing it

1569
02:02:44,480 --> 02:02:48,400
Gaming okay, I like those odds. Um this room

1570
02:02:49,760 --> 02:02:51,760
I have no idea yeet

1571
02:02:52,080 --> 02:02:54,080
Oh, wait a minute

1572
02:02:54,800 --> 02:02:56,800
Yeah

1573
02:02:56,800 --> 02:02:58,800
Okay, okay, okay

1574
02:02:59,600 --> 02:03:01,600
Oh

1575
02:03:02,400 --> 02:03:04,400
Blue

1576
02:03:05,440 --> 02:03:07,440
I have absolutely no idea

1577
02:03:09,680 --> 02:03:16,160
No, I didn't have to have that. I didn't have any boots. Good night. Good night

1578
02:03:17,280 --> 02:03:20,880
Only if it didn't have the stupid wall you would have been fine

1579
02:03:22,080 --> 02:03:24,720
Oh, man. Yeah, I would have been able to run out of it

1580
02:03:25,360 --> 02:03:31,200
That's right. That's pretty good. We actually I look pretty good when I played this. I think I only passed once so wow

1581
02:03:34,080 --> 02:03:38,320
So honestly not a bad run not a bad run for for like two hours as well

1582
02:03:38,320 --> 02:03:42,160
That's not bad at all. Yeah, so be a good thing to play with like viewers and stuff too

1583
02:03:42,320 --> 02:03:46,720
I would just force viewers to go in and kill themselves and minecraft for me, you know

1584
02:03:47,040 --> 02:03:51,920
I think you can have up to four people, but I'm sure you can mod it to have more. Oh, yeah, that's true

1585
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,640
You can use them as body bags. Yeah, perfect

1586
02:03:57,920 --> 02:04:00,800
Well, thanks for hanging out with me Fula. I'm tapping out

1593
02:04:31,840 --> 02:04:36,320
So let me try to accommodate your time zone and you're like every other collab I have this

02:06:11,280 --> 02:06:16,000
Uh, probably gonna keep going just like and do my own thing for a little bit. Yeah

1614
02:06:16,880 --> 02:06:21,040
Have fun. It was so fun hanging out. Bye. Who is the sweetest? Bye

1615
02:06:26,080 --> 02:06:28,080
All right

1616
02:06:28,720 --> 02:06:30,720
We're just here

1617
02:06:30,800 --> 02:06:32,800
By ourselves

1618
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:36,720
Let me close the game go back to the bedroom

1619
02:06:43,360 --> 02:06:45,360
Why is my

1620
02:06:46,400 --> 02:06:48,400
Feelings my body is showing

1621
02:06:49,200 --> 02:06:51,200
That was weird

1622
02:06:52,160 --> 02:06:54,720
Oh look the chat's working again. That's nifty

1623
02:06:57,120 --> 02:06:59,920
Can I can I move the chat over?

1624
02:07:02,800 --> 02:07:04,800
There we go. Oh cool

1625
02:07:05,600 --> 02:07:08,100
That's like super slow though. I don't like this chat widget

1626
02:07:10,480 --> 02:07:12,960
Full it is super nice. She's really sweet

1627
02:07:13,840 --> 02:07:20,080
Um, I remember we talked for like a long time like just over discord about stuff

1628
02:07:20,880 --> 02:07:25,680
And um, it was really cool. We actually have a lot in common. So it was really nice hanging out with her

1629
02:07:26,160 --> 02:07:31,200
She's super sweet. I'm happy that she could um guide me in the right direction

1630
02:07:32,160 --> 02:07:35,120
Because I'm she thinks she she says she's not good at those games

1631
02:07:35,360 --> 02:07:40,560
But she keeps saying all green means this blue means this and I'm like, oh, yeah, that's right because I can't forget

1632
02:07:42,320 --> 02:07:45,760
I'm not good at puzzles. But that was um, that was really fun to play

1633
02:07:45,760 --> 02:07:47,840
I would love to play that with you guys at some point

1634
02:07:47,840 --> 02:07:49,840
Maybe it could mod it to have more people

1635
02:07:50,240 --> 02:07:53,600
And then we do like rounds if you if you die you can't move forward

1636
02:07:54,560 --> 02:08:00,160
I don't know some sort of like half dead tourney. It's only like two bucks a game. So it's pretty cool

1637
02:08:01,200 --> 02:08:04,080
Um, yeah, she was big braining that she really was

1638
02:08:05,040 --> 02:08:08,000
I think she was saying she was garbage to make me feel better

1639
02:08:09,680 --> 02:08:16,080
I don't mind though. Um, I might try to stream again today later. Um, possibly

1640
02:08:17,040 --> 02:08:18,240
uh

1641
02:08:18,240 --> 02:08:21,280
Possibly, um, hoonie pop on house of blue

1642
02:08:22,240 --> 02:08:24,240
Uh on paywalls

1643
02:08:24,240 --> 02:08:28,160
Uh, no no pink egg. Just just vibes

1644
02:08:28,800 --> 02:08:34,320
So I'll try to do that. Um, probably not 4 p.m. Probably hold on. Let me look at the schedule

1645
02:08:36,160 --> 02:08:38,160

02:09:25,680 --> 02:09:30,080
Okay, Azura is not streaming today. So I'll actually probably do it

1712
02:13:01,200 --> 02:13:05,440

02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
Um, that's funny

1724
02:13:43,520 --> 02:13:48,720
Uh, so it's it's really cool. I was learning inari made um, uh

02:14:13,120 --> 02:14:15,120
I get nervous. Hi tomo

1734
02:14:16,240 --> 02:14:18,240
um

1735
02:14:18,960 --> 02:14:20,960
Let's see

1736
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:27,760
Azur is playing hades on thursday, so I probably won't play hades on that day

1737
02:14:29,840 --> 02:14:34,480
Oh, there's a asmr train on sunday, but I can't stream on sundays

1738
02:14:38,240 --> 02:14:40,240
You know gotta save it for the lord um

1739
02:14:41,680 --> 02:14:43,680
Or should I play I don't know

1740
02:14:44,880 --> 02:14:48,960
I still need to I can't play anything with a controller

1741
02:14:49,760 --> 02:14:51,760
Because I have no controllers

1742
02:14:53,440 --> 02:14:58,320
None of my controllers work. Oh vampires suck. Yes. We got to do that. So I'll do that for monday

1743
02:14:59,440 --> 02:15:01,440
Oh my god, sometimes

1744
02:15:01,760 --> 02:15:07,440
Sometimes I wish I could show you the schedule, but sometimes I wish strawnee would just put in um

1745
02:15:08,320 --> 02:15:10,000
For her block

1746
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
just like her time

1747
02:15:12,480 --> 02:15:19,200
Uh, because she just takes up usually a whole because you know strawnee just like endurance streams a lot social take up the whole entire day

1748
02:15:20,400 --> 02:15:22,800
And then like I'll just try to wedge myself in there

1749
02:15:23,760 --> 02:15:29,840
I wish you would just put like endurance stream and just the block so it doesn't take up everything

1750
02:15:31,520 --> 02:15:33,520
This is so funny. Um

1751
02:15:34,880 --> 02:15:37,840

We're like, yeah, let's see this movie because vampires are demonic

1770
02:17:03,920 --> 02:17:07,920
And they deserve to be made fun of and so and we were laughing at it so hard

1771

1781
02:17:58,400 --> 02:18:00,960
That'd be cool. Maybe like a like a vampire

1782
02:18:02,480 --> 02:18:04,960
Themed week should we have a summer ween?

1783
02:18:05,760 --> 02:18:12,000
Summer ween week. Oh, yeah, we're doing it. We're doing it summer ween. Okay. I already know what game i'm gonna play

Wait, which one is this game? I just got a new game that I wanted to play

1787
02:18:27,840 --> 02:18:29,840

Date to die for yes, and it's you just you pretty much just date baphomet

1791
02:18:46,640 --> 02:18:48,640
I

1792
02:18:50,240 --> 02:18:54,000
Yeah, because a full full one just came out. All right, so we'll do that

1793
02:18:56,960 --> 02:18:58,640
6 p.m

1794
02:18:58,640 --> 02:19:00,640
Off to find a witchy outfit

1795
02:19:01,200 --> 02:19:07,680
Um strani is doing a member script writing at 4 p.m. So I'll I'll take emi's slot

1796
02:19:09,280 --> 02:19:11,280
Um, oh, yeah, she's uh

1797
02:19:12,240 --> 02:19:19,280
Emie's doing a collab with uh, rui lapifi and elia still aria. Oh sick. That's awesome

1798
02:19:19,840 --> 02:19:22,400
At 1 p.m. So I'll take I'll take her 6 p.m. Slot

1799
02:19:23,040 --> 02:19:29,920
I I move around my schedule to accommodate people because like it's not fun when we all overlap and you want to watch us do things

1800
02:19:29,920 --> 02:19:31,920
you know

1801
02:19:31,920 --> 02:19:33,920
um

1802
02:19:34,560 --> 02:19:36,560
and

1803
02:19:37,280 --> 02:19:41,760
Yeah, I think that would be I think that would be pretty like I try to accommodate everybody

1804
02:19:41,760 --> 02:19:45,680
Just so like I don't want to overlap with like people if I don't have to that's why

1805
02:19:46,160 --> 02:19:51,120
I sort of kind of don't have this most super consistent schedule because like

1806
02:19:51,920 --> 02:19:53,360
um

1807
02:19:53,360 --> 02:19:54,960
sometimes

1808
02:19:54,960 --> 02:19:59,120
Like I know people will want to watch strani stream but also watch me too

1809
02:20:00,320 --> 02:20:01,840
um

1810
02:20:01,840 --> 02:20:03,840
and then or like

1811
02:20:04,400 --> 02:20:06,400
If like

1812
02:20:07,920 --> 02:20:13,040
Some things going on. Yeah on like I'll be the when we get new girls in gen 2

1813
02:20:13,040 --> 02:20:17,120
I'll probably the first one to change my time because I'll stream at any time

1814
02:20:19,120 --> 02:20:22,000
I just I I don't know. I'm just uh

1815
02:20:23,600 --> 02:20:30,720
Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm I'm too fucking nice for my own good. Uh, so then I want to do wedding witch

1817
02:20:44,640 --> 02:20:46,640

1818
02:20:47,920 --> 02:20:51,200
Strani's doing a block ups campaign. Oh shit

1819
02:20:53,520 --> 02:20:55,520

And then and then I'll do my ASMR

1821
02:20:59,940 --> 02:21:05,060
And then the pin pals that watch me can go watch emmy's members asmr stream afterwards

1822
02:21:05,620 --> 02:21:08,500
And then azur is playing hades at nine. We love that

1823
02:21:13,300 --> 02:21:18,660
Yeah, like I try again I'm part of a business I try to people people think I'm just gonna like

1824
02:21:19,460 --> 02:21:23,860
Be a bitch the entire time and just do my own thing. No, I'm gonna I'm a team player

1825
02:21:24,500 --> 02:21:26,500

ASMR

1832
02:21:53,060 --> 02:21:55,060

1833
02:21:56,500 --> 02:21:58,500
I

1834
02:22:05,540 --> 02:22:08,340
Think I might make a like a summer ween week graphic

02:22:44,100 --> 02:22:47,460
With um for azur as donathan

1842
02:22:48,740 --> 02:22:50,740
um

1843
02:22:51,220 --> 02:22:54,180
Oh, emi's playing into the pit. I've been watching markiplier play that

1844
02:22:54,900 --> 02:22:57,620
Maybe at 8 p.m. I'll play something

1845
02:22:59,140 --> 02:23:01,780
Because strani has a members

1846
02:23:02,740 --> 02:23:04,740
movie

1847
02:23:04,740 --> 02:23:09,540
She puts she always overlaps her members stuff with for my slot. Um

1848
02:23:11,300 --> 02:23:14,020
But then again like she she's australian time

1849
02:23:14,980 --> 02:23:16,980
um

1850
02:23:17,780 --> 02:23:22,900
8 p.m. I'll stream on saturday. I don't know what to stream saturday. What's another witchy themed thing

1851
02:23:23,780 --> 02:23:27,860
That um, I what time is the witch ASMR normal time 4 p.m

1852
02:23:28,740 --> 02:23:35,060
The only time that's different actually is just um wednesday, which is the wedding witch game

1853
02:23:37,060 --> 02:23:45,220
Um, what should it what sort of witchy or halloween themed thing should I do for saturday that doesn't require a controller

1854
02:23:46,180 --> 02:23:53,700
Because I need to get a controller. I might have to put it on throne because I paid my bills and I have no money

1855
02:23:56,740 --> 02:24:03,380
Hand cam drink mixing brewing potion. Oh, that's a good idea. Oh my god. That's perfect actually. Thank you

1856
02:24:04,740 --> 02:24:06,740
Uh she be

1857
02:24:07,780 --> 02:24:09,780
Hand cam

1858
02:24:11,780 --> 02:24:13,780
Mixing

1859
02:24:14,740 --> 02:24:16,740
Or

1860
02:24:17,140 --> 02:24:25,300
Alternatively, I could dress up as a witch for the ASMR and have a hand cam alongside the ASMR

1861
02:24:26,900 --> 02:24:28,900
Which would you prefer?

1862
02:24:29,620 --> 02:24:34,340
Would you prefer hand cam with ASMR or would you prefer its own hand cam?

1863
02:24:35,940 --> 02:24:41,380
Because I think it'd be like kind of like nice visual for you guys to see me like mixing stuff

1864
02:24:41,780 --> 02:24:44,420
Like mixing the the wood soup, you know

1865
02:24:49,220 --> 02:24:51,220
And I can still mix drinks

1866
02:24:52,020 --> 02:24:56,420
Yeah, okay, we'll do that. We'll do that. We'll do that. We'll do that. I'll I'll make it a combined thing

1867
02:24:57,220 --> 02:24:59,220
Uh discard

1868
02:25:00,740 --> 02:25:02,740
Oh

1869
02:25:02,820 --> 02:25:09,540
With hand cam I'll have to think of drinks to mix because I don't drink alcohol guys. I really don't um

1870
02:25:10,260 --> 02:25:14,420
Or like I just make I don't I'll have to find stuff to make

1871
02:25:16,340 --> 02:25:21,140
Um, but yeah, I like I love visual aids and ASMR like they make and I can do like

1872
02:25:21,860 --> 02:25:27,540
Finger flutters and stuff and be like and then hopefully I get that um, I get that

1873
02:25:28,660 --> 02:25:30,020
Uh

1874
02:25:30,020 --> 02:25:33,140
Camera clamp so then it'll be a lot easier for me to do

1875
02:25:34,100 --> 02:25:35,060
um

1876
02:25:35,060 --> 02:25:37,060
like top down

1877
02:25:37,300 --> 02:25:43,700
Uh webcam record because I just used my like c920 webcam. I don't think I'm gonna try to get any webcam anytime soon

1878
02:25:44,580 --> 02:25:46,580
Because I think it's fine

1879
02:25:47,540 --> 02:25:49,780
I don't really think I need a camera. It's not like

1880
02:25:51,540 --> 02:25:53,540
I should find what those really

1881
02:25:53,700 --> 02:25:58,740
crazy twitch thoughts use that have like 4k hd, but my computer can't even run that so

1882
02:25:59,460 --> 02:26:01,460
That wouldn't even work

1883
02:26:02,020 --> 02:26:08,500
Please be cruel during the ASMR. Oh, of course. I've captured you to eat you. There will be more involved

1884
02:26:08,660 --> 02:26:10,660
I I've just decided

1885
02:26:10,660 --> 02:26:13,860
The drinks for the brewer gamer subs. Oh, oh my god

1886
02:26:16,740 --> 02:26:20,100
This is why this is why we're talking this is why we're having a great time

1887
02:26:20,740 --> 02:26:24,340
Oh my god, like oh like this is why I talk to you guys

1888
02:26:25,140 --> 02:26:29,540
Because you guys have great ideas and I want to give you what you guys want

1889
02:26:30,180 --> 02:26:34,180
You can use the international bartender association for some content cocktails. Oh, okay

1890
02:26:34,420 --> 02:26:39,620
I want to put like I want to put like um like the little sparkly stuff in it

1891
02:26:40,820 --> 02:26:43,300
The sparkly like so make it look like potions

1892
02:26:44,980 --> 02:26:49,540
Cutting veggies ASMR. I could make a stew that I put you guys in um

1893
02:26:50,660 --> 02:26:55,140
But I think I'm gonna stick with drink mixing. Yeah edible glitter. I'll buy some edible glitter

1894
02:26:55,220 --> 02:26:57,380
I don't know where I'll have to order on amazon

1895
02:26:58,180 --> 02:27:03,380
Uh, I have a potion bottle from one of my my uh renaissance fair cosplays

1896
02:27:04,340 --> 02:27:06,340
um

1897
02:27:06,820 --> 02:27:08,820
I also have a bunch of witchy stuff

1898
02:27:10,580 --> 02:27:15,940
Because I'm a pagan so that'll work out. Um, I think me and emmy actually have the same like

1899
02:27:16,660 --> 02:27:23,540
Uh, what's it called tapestry that she's used for a hand cam before maybe I'll do a little bit of tarot too

1900
02:27:24,260 --> 02:27:27,300
I could have a tarot reading stream on saturday for hand cam

1901
02:27:28,980 --> 02:27:30,580
Hmm

1902
02:27:30,580 --> 02:27:35,140
I might monetize that though and like because people kind of kept spamming me for stuff

1903
02:27:35,220 --> 02:27:38,820
So I might have to be like, oh if you donate like ten dollars, you'll get a reading

1904
02:27:39,860 --> 02:27:41,860
um

1905
02:27:42,100 --> 02:27:46,500
That could be fun. Would you guys be okay with that if I pay all that just because

1906
02:27:47,460 --> 02:27:49,140
Uh, it

1907
02:27:49,140 --> 02:27:53,780
It might sound stupid to you, but it is emotionally taxing to read cards for people

1908
02:27:54,500 --> 02:27:55,940
and um

1909
02:27:55,940 --> 02:28:00,740
A bunch of people kind of just I realized spammed a bunch uh of their questions

1910
02:28:01,540 --> 02:28:03,540
And when I didn't answer them they would keep spamming

1911
02:28:04,580 --> 02:28:06,580
um, so I might

1912
02:28:07,060 --> 02:28:09,060
I might pay all that

1913
02:28:10,020 --> 02:28:12,660
And then it'll also help me keep better track of who to read

1914
02:28:12,660 --> 02:28:19,940
Um, I do take it seriously tarot isn't a joke to me either is like spell stuff

1915
02:28:21,780 --> 02:28:23,780
Um

1916
02:28:25,380 --> 02:28:27,380
So I could make a spell jar

1917
02:28:28,100 --> 02:28:30,020
Oh

1918
02:28:30,020 --> 02:28:35,940
You know what I think I'll make a spell jar too. We'll do some tarot make a spell jar together

1919
02:28:37,140 --> 02:28:38,500
Um

1920
02:28:38,500 --> 02:28:44,180
Yeah, helps with filtering again. I hate paywalling stuff, but like just for again filtering purposes

1921
02:28:45,860 --> 02:28:47,860
Uh

1922
02:28:47,860 --> 02:28:49,460
Yeah, okay

1923
02:28:49,460 --> 02:28:51,460
We'll do that

1924
02:28:52,820 --> 02:29:01,940
So saturday is that's azura's birthday donathan though. I would hate to take away from azura's birthday donathan

1925
02:29:05,060 --> 02:29:07,060
So I might

1926
02:29:07,300 --> 02:29:09,300
Do

1927
02:29:09,380 --> 02:29:11,380
The asmr on saturday

1928
02:29:13,300 --> 02:29:15,300
Instead

1929
02:29:15,300 --> 02:29:17,300
Or I can do wedding

1930
02:29:18,980 --> 02:29:20,980
I could do the wedding witch

1931
02:29:22,740 --> 02:29:28,020
On saturday because I would have to make that at 8 p.m. And then I would have to make

1932
02:29:31,300 --> 02:29:33,300
Oh

1933
02:29:37,940 --> 02:29:45,300
Because I don't want to like take away like profit wise from azura's birthday donathan. I would prefer you guys to support her on that day

1934
02:29:45,940 --> 02:29:47,940
um

1935
02:29:50,900 --> 02:29:54,260
I'm gonna do the wedding witch on saturday at 8 p.m

2009
02:35:35,460 --> 02:35:37,460
depending I don't know if I'm

2010
02:35:38,420 --> 02:35:42,740
My family might be spending christmas with Salem

2011
02:35:44,180 --> 02:35:47,620
Um, because usually usually I'm alone for the holidays

2012
02:35:48,260 --> 02:35:50,980
Uh, because my family doesn't really like do anything

2013
02:35:51,860 --> 02:35:57,060
They're they're too busy. My parents are busy people. My parents once I left they're just like

2014
02:35:57,860 --> 02:35:59,860
We could do whatever we want. We have a life now

2015
02:36:02,260 --> 02:36:03,780
Um

2016
02:36:03,780 --> 02:36:05,780
So, yeah

2017
02:36:05,780 --> 02:36:07,380
uh

2018
02:36:07,780 --> 02:36:11,380
We'll see I'll see if I'm hanging out with Salem in her family

2019
02:36:12,500 --> 02:36:15,780
On christmas. I know I'm probably we usually do like a friendsgiving

2020
02:36:17,620 --> 02:36:18,740
Um

2021
02:36:18,740 --> 02:36:22,660
I also still need to talk to Salem about doing the podcast like we still have to get that

2022
02:36:22,660 --> 02:36:26,740
So I have to make her like a v2 bottle and all that stuff or like a png youtuber

2023
02:36:27,940 --> 02:36:29,540
um

2024
02:36:29,540 --> 02:36:32,820
I got a lot of I got a lot of stuff planned guys got a lot of stuff going on

2025
02:36:33,540 --> 02:36:34,580
Um

2026
02:36:34,580 --> 02:36:38,020
Holidays with us and viola then yeah precisely essentially

2027
02:36:38,500 --> 02:36:42,420
It just sucked. I like I try to leave my house around the holidays though because like

2028
02:36:42,900 --> 02:36:48,660
Like I do love spending time with you guys. I remember last year as Rina. I literally just stayed

2029
02:36:50,020 --> 02:36:52,020
And just celebrated everything with

2030
02:36:52,900 --> 02:36:54,900
I did the like um

2031
02:36:55,700 --> 02:36:56,900
the uh

2032
02:36:56,900 --> 02:37:01,860
pagan origins of Halloween and pagan origins of christmas and the

2033
02:37:02,500 --> 02:37:03,220
uh

2034
02:37:03,220 --> 02:37:05,220
pagan origins of Thanksgiving

2035
02:37:06,660 --> 02:37:07,700
Um

2036
02:37:07,700 --> 02:37:10,100
And I did those little slideshows. That was pretty fun

2037
02:37:10,820 --> 02:37:15,220
Actually in like or like what actually happened during Thanksgiving. Um, but we'll see

2038
02:37:15,780 --> 02:37:20,180
Uh, but you guys are the people I love so like well, I'll see I'll just see how it is

2039
02:37:20,900 --> 02:37:22,900
I'll see how it is. Um

2040
02:37:24,260 --> 02:37:28,500
100% obviously my birthday september 20 100%

2041
02:37:29,300 --> 02:37:34,820
Uh, usually we don't celebrate friends giving with all the girly pops on Thanksgiving

2042
02:37:34,900 --> 02:37:39,940
So we're probably we can probably spend maybe I'll do a cooking stream for Thanksgiving

2043
02:37:40,500 --> 02:37:45,940
Look at me thinking so far ahead Christmas. I definitely want to you know, I already told you guys stuff for Halloween

2044
02:37:46,740 --> 02:37:48,340
um

2045
02:37:48,340 --> 02:37:50,100
Usually I go

2046
02:37:50,100 --> 02:37:55,780
To like a spooky spooky fair. There's usually like spooky fairs in my area

2047
02:37:56,740 --> 02:37:58,900
Um, or like haunted houses

2048
02:38:00,100 --> 02:38:02,340
Or like haunted amusement parks

As new england loves that shit. Um

2050
02:38:07,060 --> 02:38:10,900
So I'll probably do something like that. Maybe I could do like a live vlog. I don't know

2051
02:38:10,900 --> 02:38:14,420
I've never done a live vlog before. I probably accidentally stalks myself

2052
02:38:16,260 --> 02:38:19,620
Um, I'll probably maybe I'll do live vlogs a little bit later in

2053
02:38:20,260 --> 02:38:26,020
My tenure at bealer. Wait. I just I like I like thinking a lot. I like I like thinking

I'll be fun

2080
02:39:41,060 --> 02:39:46,580
It'll be actually funny if we played sucker for love date to die for on her birthday because it'll be like we're romancing azura

2081
02:39:47,300 --> 02:39:51,540
Um, and then sunday's off. Okay. Does that sound good? Yeah

2082
02:39:53,380 --> 02:39:55,540
I have some spaghetti maybe some spaghetti

2083
02:39:56,340 --> 02:39:59,380
Some good spaghetti would be actually that's a pretty good idea

2084
02:40:01,700 --> 02:40:07,540
Uh, there's probably I won't be surprised if I stream tomorrow. I don't know why I had tomorrow

2085
02:40:07,620 --> 02:40:10,260
I didn't put anything for tomorrow. I'll be honest with you

2086
02:40:11,460 --> 02:40:13,140
um

2087
02:40:13,140 --> 02:40:16,180
I'll probably maybe I'll do like an elden ring gorilla tomorrow

2088
02:40:16,660 --> 02:40:22,340
Actually, no, I can't I don't have a fucking controller. Wait, is my controller still not working it started working

2089
02:40:22,420 --> 02:40:24,420
It started charging but then it stopped

2090
02:40:27,060 --> 02:40:29,060
Yeah, it's just

2091
02:40:29,140 --> 02:40:32,420
That's shit not working anymore homie. I tried another controller too

2092
02:40:33,620 --> 02:40:35,620
I'm wondering if it's the cable

2093
02:40:36,740 --> 02:40:41,620
Because it's saying it keeps flashing orange like it's charging but then it never turns on

2094
02:40:42,580 --> 02:40:46,420
I don't know what that means. It blinks twice and then another twice

2095
02:40:48,340 --> 02:40:51,460
We could do a fun zastu tomorrow. Maybe I kind of talk enough

2096
02:40:53,780 --> 02:40:56,740
Did you set a day off to get groceries and get controller from your paw?

2097
02:40:56,900 --> 02:41:01,860
My dad said he wouldn't give me his controller because it says he has one. Actually, no, he has two controllers

2098
02:41:02,740 --> 02:41:07,220
They're both custom made my dad is a scuff controller and some other custom made controller. Um

2099
02:41:07,860 --> 02:41:10,340
Because my dad plays a lot of lots a lot of call of duty

2100
02:41:11,140 --> 02:41:13,140
um

2101
02:41:13,460 --> 02:41:15,460
I hope I wonder if he's gotten any better

2102
02:41:17,700 --> 02:41:19,700
Uh

2103
02:41:19,780 --> 02:41:22,180
But yeah

2104
02:41:22,180 --> 02:41:28,580
Yeah, every streamer isn't assumed zatsu usually be zatsu for like 30 minutes to an hour before I play a game

2105
02:41:29,700 --> 02:41:32,980
Guys, I might come back later today. I just need to go to sleep

2106
02:41:33,700 --> 02:41:36,500
and then wake up feed fia and then

2107
02:41:37,300 --> 02:41:41,220
Hop on I need to go to sleep wake up feed fia finish

2108
02:41:41,460 --> 02:41:47,060
I just need to finish recording that damn asmr. So I can give you a new asmr video

2109
02:41:47,860 --> 02:41:49,540
and then

2110
02:41:49,540 --> 02:41:51,060
um

2111
02:41:51,060 --> 02:41:54,820
Over I'll stream a little bit perhaps if I feel better

2112
02:41:55,220 --> 02:41:58,260
Because I'm a kind of a little bit dizzy because that game kind of made me a little bit motion sick

2113
02:41:59,060 --> 02:41:59,620
um

2114
02:41:59,620 --> 02:42:04,420
And then I also need to do the script writing for october because I said told just told strani

2115
02:42:04,420 --> 02:42:07,540
I would rewrite the script but now I'm actually wondering if I have time for that

2116
02:42:08,340 --> 02:42:10,340
um, who knows

2117
02:42:12,340 --> 02:42:17,140
I probably no I'll have time tomorrow. Maybe I set aside some uh saturday for script writing

2118
02:42:18,020 --> 02:42:22,180
Maybe actually yeah, I might maybe I'll keep that for because I want to record

2119
02:42:23,220 --> 02:42:24,260
um

2120
02:42:24,260 --> 02:42:28,260
My audios for patreon because I still haven't recorded september yet

2121
02:42:29,300 --> 02:42:31,060
uh

2122
02:42:31,060 --> 02:42:33,060
I'm gonna rewrite october

2123
02:42:33,620 --> 02:42:38,900
I'm gonna rewrite october completely. I'm gonna do a totally different theme. I'm gonna make it halloween themed

2124
02:42:39,700 --> 02:42:41,700
for each um

2125
02:42:41,780 --> 02:42:43,540
day

2126
02:42:43,540 --> 02:42:47,300
And uh, so you guys can tell me I'll probably tweet out

2127
02:42:47,860 --> 02:42:53,220
September is very close. Yeah, exactly. That's why I want to I want to get on top of that

2128
02:42:53,780 --> 02:42:55,460
um

2129
02:42:55,460 --> 02:42:58,260
So maybe I'll keep tomorrow open just so I can record

2130
02:42:59,300 --> 02:43:01,300
um

2131
02:43:01,460 --> 02:43:05,940
Also, I was gonna record yesterday, but there's a stupid fucking storm and I didn't feel good

2132
02:43:06,820 --> 02:43:09,540
Yeah, I think I'm gonna put that controller on throne

2133
02:43:11,300 --> 02:43:12,580
Uh

2134
02:43:12,580 --> 02:43:16,180
Yeah, I think I I need to start organizing my time better

2135
02:43:16,660 --> 02:43:20,580
Like I do like the calendar on here because it helps remind me what I'm doing

2136
02:43:20,660 --> 02:43:24,900
But I needed I think I'm gonna put a cat like an actual calendar calendar

2137
02:43:25,460 --> 02:43:27,540
That I can have above my desk on my throne

2138
02:43:27,540 --> 02:43:31,620
So I just remember what the fuck I'm doing because I forget all the time

2139
02:43:32,580 --> 02:43:34,180
um

2140
02:43:34,180 --> 02:43:36,660
Is that the first time I swore this stream? I don't even know

2141
02:43:37,460 --> 02:43:39,460
Uh, but yeah

2142
02:43:40,260 --> 02:43:42,980
I had some keynote ideas. Thank you. I'm gonna

2143
02:43:43,700 --> 02:43:45,700
I'm gonna practice

2144
02:43:45,700 --> 02:43:48,500
I haven't written anything like that in a long time

2145
02:43:49,620 --> 02:43:53,380
When I say a long time it was a couple months ago. I remember I started writing a

2146
02:43:53,860 --> 02:43:57,060
I'm probably just gonna look at one of the scripts stroney

2147
02:43:57,700 --> 02:44:04,340
Stroney stroney wrote me before and kind of follow that formula because I prefer how her her writing style is

2148
02:44:05,220 --> 02:44:09,140
Um, it's all gonna be dom. It's all dom. It's gonna be dom

2149
02:44:09,940 --> 02:44:13,860
I'm not gonna fuck around with the stupid like

2150
02:44:15,220 --> 02:44:21,140
Kind of dom shit like I'm gonna do it dom and I'm not gonna do the really crappy dom that the other guy wrote

2151
02:44:22,100 --> 02:44:24,100
Because yeah

2152
02:44:25,140 --> 02:44:30,580
Because I just I want to do like dom werewolf girl. I would love to do dom vampire girl

2153
02:44:31,140 --> 02:44:33,620
Dom, I don't know ghost girl

2154
02:44:34,260 --> 02:44:36,260
Dom slime girl

2155
02:44:37,140 --> 02:44:39,140
Like that would be fun

2156
02:44:39,380 --> 02:44:46,820
Got to yeah, I've never been there. Uh, it's what is it? Is it r slash gwa? I don't know what it is. Um

2157
02:44:47,540 --> 02:44:51,060
I'm a city city of dom because uh

2158
02:44:54,020 --> 02:44:58,500
The the script I want to just literally give you just like a full dom thing

2159
02:44:59,700 --> 02:45:02,340
The thing is though patreon also doesn't like dommy mommies

2160
02:45:02,900 --> 02:45:05,540
Uh, just like they don't like what emmy and ic do

2161
02:45:06,420 --> 02:45:09,540
And then you have they have to dance around it. They just released a new thing

2162
02:45:10,420 --> 02:45:16,180
Um, I think it was like a month ago. I remember sending the the update to stroney like they don't like

2163
02:45:16,980 --> 02:45:20,020
Mommy related stuff. So I I can't be like

2164
02:45:22,260 --> 02:45:24,260
Mommy related

2165
02:45:24,660 --> 02:45:29,860
Or like step mommy stuff because I would have written like step mom does this or blah blah blah does this

2166
02:45:32,420 --> 02:45:33,700
Um

2167
02:45:33,700 --> 02:45:39,620
But I like I have to you do have to kind of skirt stuff with dom and you can't be like abusive

2168
02:45:40,980 --> 02:45:43,140
Um, it's it is really difficult

2169
02:45:43,940 --> 02:45:50,500
Um with their how their yeah, exactly the payment processors. Um, I do have like two

2170
02:45:51,860 --> 02:45:58,580
Scripts I want to read for blue website. Um, and those will be paywalls behind the five dollar

2171
02:45:59,300 --> 02:46:00,420
Um

2172
02:46:00,420 --> 02:46:03,540
That are kind of I've said I've yanked from

2173
02:46:04,660 --> 02:46:07,220
Suggestions on a certain basket weaving board

2174
02:46:08,020 --> 02:46:09,620
um

2175
02:46:09,620 --> 02:46:10,980
But yeah

2176
02:46:10,980 --> 02:46:12,980
Wait, what is this?

2177
02:46:13,620 --> 02:46:15,620
Oh

2178
02:46:17,540 --> 02:46:19,540
That tweet's actually doing pretty good

2179
02:46:21,540 --> 02:46:23,940
I'm the hello kumars and feet enjoyers tweet

2180
02:46:26,580 --> 02:46:33,540
It's so funny. Um, I'll be honest with you. I should show you guys. I look my model is way darker on

2181
02:46:35,620 --> 02:46:40,260
Stream and I don't know what is the brightness on my displays, but I'm a lot darker

2182
02:46:40,340 --> 02:46:44,820
I accidentally made myself a lot darker than I wanted because I can take a picture of my model right now

2183
02:46:45,540 --> 02:46:47,940
And I'm actually a lot lighter than what comes up

2184
02:46:50,100 --> 02:46:52,100
Let me I'll take a picture for you guys

2185
02:46:54,180 --> 02:46:56,180
Can I

2186
02:46:57,700 --> 02:46:59,700
Can I get that stupid? Okay

2187
02:47:01,780 --> 02:47:07,380
And this is this is what my skin tone is supposed to be I I'll be honest with you I kind of made myself darker than I

2188
02:47:08,340 --> 02:47:10,340
But I I don't know how to fix it

2189
02:47:10,500 --> 02:47:12,660
I'll post that when you guys can see

2190
02:47:14,020 --> 02:47:20,660
But I realize when no, I'm not gonna be even guys. I'm trying to be close to my own personal like skin tone

2191
02:47:20,740 --> 02:47:23,460
I'm not that dark as my model currently

2192
02:47:24,580 --> 02:47:26,580
um

2193
02:47:26,580 --> 02:47:30,580
But I realize in like thumbnails and stuff. I remember I was like wait

2194
02:47:32,180 --> 02:47:34,180
Huh wait a second

2195
02:47:34,580 --> 02:47:38,260
That's not the skin tone I wanted but I'm like, uh, it doesn't really matter

2196
02:47:42,420 --> 02:47:46,260
I was requested for it, but uh you sent me a script

2197
02:47:47,860 --> 02:47:49,860
Okay

2198
02:47:50,500 --> 02:47:52,500
Yeah, they don't like yeah, they will

2199
02:47:53,300 --> 02:47:55,220
That's a good point color is hard here

2200
02:47:55,220 --> 02:48:01,140
I'll just I'll literally post it on my alt right now and you guys can go see what my skin tone is supposed to be

2201
02:48:01,540 --> 02:48:03,540
I

2202
02:48:04,180 --> 02:48:10,980
Realize my model comes off a lot darker on stream

2203
02:48:11,780 --> 02:48:14,280
Versus on my screen

2204
02:48:15,940 --> 02:48:17,940
IDK why

2205
02:48:20,180 --> 02:48:23,300
What my brightness is set up

2206
02:48:31,540 --> 02:48:33,540
You

2207
02:48:51,780 --> 02:48:58,340
There we go, which we did that. Um, I like how I said I was gonna raid I see like an hour ago. Um

2208
02:49:01,540 --> 02:49:03,380
She be model be like

2209
02:49:03,380 --> 02:49:06,660
Do you want me to send it again? It's okay. I'll find it. Um guys

2210
02:49:06,740 --> 02:49:09,460
I don't really look at mirrors too much anymore. I'll be honest with you

2211
02:49:09,540 --> 02:49:11,940
So I prefer people you could just like at me

2212
02:49:12,820 --> 02:49:18,260
And I'll try to hopefully get doesn't get like filtered out. Um, I see she's doing a watch along

2213
02:49:18,660 --> 02:49:21,060
Probably not a good rate is she is it a

2214
02:49:22,100 --> 02:49:24,100
What?

2215
02:49:27,220 --> 02:49:29,220
What day is it

2216
02:49:30,180 --> 02:49:32,180
She's watching Yu-Gi-Oh

2217
02:49:38,020 --> 02:49:41,300
1990 is that a members is she is that a members thing?

2218
02:49:46,660 --> 02:49:50,900
Or do I at you dm no you just do at she be as of

2219
02:49:51,300 --> 02:49:53,300

Um, just like literally at me on twitter not like dm me you can't dm me

2221
02:50:02,740 --> 02:50:08,900
Do you only stream on ty? Yes, I do only stream on ty on tube you

2222
02:50:10,340 --> 02:50:12,340
um

2223
02:50:13,300 --> 02:50:20,740
I hope you look well that'll never happen in terms of that'll be anybody who uses patreon or at the whims of patreon and the payment processors

2224
02:50:20,900 --> 02:50:22,100
so

2225
02:50:22,100 --> 02:50:27,140
Um, no, it's open. Okay. No, no, I'm still gonna read. I see because that was my plan. I'm not gonna

2226
02:50:27,700 --> 02:50:29,700
I don't care if she's doing a watch along or not

2227
02:50:30,260 --> 02:50:35,220
Um, yeah, why don't you guys go watch Yu-Gi-Oh? That's like peak. I don't know what you guys are talking about

2228
02:50:38,900 --> 02:50:40,900
All right

2229
02:50:41,780 --> 02:50:46,660
And then once I get uh, eventually we'll come back to hitman abs solution. I just need a controller

2230
02:50:48,260 --> 02:50:50,260
Uh

2231
02:50:51,300 --> 02:50:54,020
It's a really funny thumbnail. Oh my god

2232
02:51:01,460 --> 02:51:08,020
All right. Oh my god, my tummy hurt. I need to go grocery shopping for actual food

2233
02:51:13,700 --> 02:51:19,300
Could take a screenshot of the script too, you know the thread of it all would be easier to read

2234
02:51:20,900 --> 02:51:25,860
Well, I don't have a threat. No, it's like somebody linked me something from well not linked me in particular

2235
02:51:25,860 --> 02:51:30,260
I was just being a creep uh somebody linked a script bin

2236
02:51:31,460 --> 02:51:34,340
Of a here. I can I can literally read you what it is

2237
02:51:35,220 --> 02:51:40,020
Um, because I don't care. I'm not I'm not gonna keep surprises. So there's one

2238
02:51:42,180 --> 02:51:44,180
That is

2239
02:51:46,820 --> 02:51:50,340
Uh, your bossy girlfriend makes you her bitch female for male

2240
02:51:50,980 --> 02:51:52,980
And then the other one is

2241
02:51:53,540 --> 02:51:55,220
somebody linked

2242
02:51:55,220 --> 02:51:57,220
My voice is your sex life

2243
02:52:01,060 --> 02:52:03,060
And it's

2244
02:52:04,180 --> 02:52:08,020
It's lily about a girl who is like a streamer

2245
02:52:09,620 --> 02:52:15,540
Who tells you like you have to be obsessed with me and just degrades you the entire time. Um

2246
02:52:15,860 --> 02:52:17,860
Oh

2247
02:52:19,460 --> 02:52:20,980
Yeah

2248
02:52:20,980 --> 02:52:24,980
Does that make sense? Are we all are we all at an agreement here? Are we all good?

2249
02:52:26,820 --> 02:52:28,820
Are we all having a great time?

2250
02:52:31,060 --> 02:52:33,060
Make sense. All right

2251
02:52:33,860 --> 02:52:40,100
Mind take a phone pick and not take a screen grab. I took a phone pick because on my screen

2252
02:52:42,740 --> 02:52:44,740
It doesn't it's the brightness

2253
02:52:46,500 --> 02:52:53,380
I don't know what the brightness like it doesn't make a difference on if I screen grab it's still going to screenshot as a darker tone

2254
02:52:55,220 --> 02:52:58,820
Oh my god, I don't know. I don't know how to explain it to you guys

2255
02:53:00,740 --> 02:53:02,740
My screen brightness

2256
02:53:04,100 --> 02:53:06,100
Is changes that

2257
02:53:06,980 --> 02:53:08,820
Yeah

2258
02:53:08,820 --> 02:53:13,940
But do you but do you see what I mean though like I'm I'm supposed I might just color pick

2259
02:53:16,180 --> 02:53:18,180
Because none of my colors are accurate

2260
02:53:19,780 --> 02:53:25,220
Um these displays I've had for like years, but I don't really care that much about replacing them anytime soon

2261
02:53:26,180 --> 02:53:31,780
Uh, I have more other priorities. I'd rather replace like my computer and paying off my debt

2262
02:53:33,220 --> 02:53:35,220
Than getting new displays

2263
02:53:35,300 --> 02:53:40,260
That have more accurate color. They're just like asus ones. They both have the same brand

2264
02:53:40,500 --> 02:53:44,820
But for some reason they're both the two screens. I'll match them exactly for the settings

2265
02:53:45,460 --> 02:53:50,580
For the screen settings and they're also still different from one another like one is darker than the other

2266
02:53:52,740 --> 02:53:56,740
Sometimes let the 10 I know I need it. I need to get rid of the 1070

2267
02:53:59,380 --> 02:54:05,140
Um, yeah, I know you guys will probably freaking cry because I'm technically supposed to be whiter

2268
02:54:09,780 --> 02:54:13,140
I actually I might I might color grab

2269
02:54:15,700 --> 02:54:22,900
I'm like colors in my that on my model and make them more accurate. I don't fucking care. I just like

2270
02:54:24,260 --> 02:54:26,500
I'm just I'm just irritated that it does that

2271
02:54:27,140 --> 02:54:30,900
Because then I realized this stuff is still inaccurate and I'm just like what the fuck

2272
02:54:32,100 --> 02:54:34,340
The screens are very inconsistent. Yeah

2273
02:54:38,020 --> 02:54:43,860
But yeah, you guys see like, uh, I'm sorry. I'm not supposed to be that dark. I'm just gonna I'm just supposed to be tan

2274
02:54:45,060 --> 02:54:47,060
I'm

2275
02:54:47,380 --> 02:54:49,380
I'm just supposed to be tan

2276
02:54:49,700 --> 02:54:54,660
Because I'm not that dark. I'm I'm literally like the color that in that screen grab is what I am

2277
02:54:56,100 --> 02:55:00,100
Oh, no, it's like the color in that screen like you guys seen the picture I posted on my alt

2278
02:55:00,420 --> 02:55:02,420
That's I I'm actually a little bit lighter

2279
02:55:02,900 --> 02:55:07,140
Because I darkened up the photo a little bit. Um, when I edited it up

2280
02:55:08,580 --> 02:55:10,740
To make my butt smaller. I mean what?

2281
02:55:11,540 --> 02:55:17,860
Um, but are we good? Are we all agreed? I want to read. I see now

2282
02:55:22,820 --> 02:55:24,820
Oh, my stomach hurts

2283
02:55:26,420 --> 02:55:32,900
Are you oh, oh another thing another thing because I know people are gonna do this or I know somebody's gonna say this

2284
02:55:33,300 --> 02:55:35,540
Oh, why is she be?

2285
02:55:36,100 --> 02:55:42,900
Butting in to emmy's niche with all the witchy stuff one emmy doesn't give a fuck

2286
02:55:42,980 --> 02:55:44,420
I know she doesn't

2287
02:55:44,420 --> 02:55:49,220
Two she could have a whole day or a week where she does dom stuff, you know, it's fine

2288
02:55:49,460 --> 02:55:52,980
We we it's this is a summer ween. It's a funny event

2289
02:55:53,780 --> 02:55:55,780
I want to do something cool

2290
02:55:55,860 --> 02:56:02,740
Yes, I know her thing is she's the witchy one. I know she's the one with the book and doing the spells and haba dabba dabba

2291
02:56:03,140 --> 02:56:04,740
But

2292
02:56:04,740 --> 02:56:06,740
I want to do something fun

2293
02:56:06,820 --> 02:56:10,500
I want to have a themed week like a spirit week that you would have in school

2294
02:56:11,300 --> 02:56:17,300
And I'm also IRL a pagan so it's kind of cool to show you guys parts of my own

2295
02:56:17,860 --> 02:56:19,860
belief system my culture

2296
02:56:19,940 --> 02:56:23,780
Um, and it's just fun and it's fun fun games, you know

2297
02:56:25,940 --> 02:56:27,940
All right, um

2298
02:56:28,900 --> 02:56:34,500
They're not gonna be able to handle October. I just like I just know I'm just like I'm just I'm I'm punching

2299
02:56:35,300 --> 02:56:37,300
the one dude that's gonna

2300
02:56:38,260 --> 02:56:40,260
Shit up stuff really fast

2301
02:56:41,460 --> 02:56:47,380
You know what I don't like I don't like when people follow me back multiple times and it's like unfollow and follow me

2302
02:56:47,460 --> 02:56:49,220
I'll follow and follow me

2303
02:56:49,220 --> 02:56:51,060
Expecting me to follow them

2304
02:56:51,060 --> 02:56:54,020
Because somebody just did that while I've been sitting here for the last hour

2305
02:56:54,500 --> 02:56:57,220
It just did it a bunch of times and I'm probably gonna block them

2306
02:56:58,180 --> 02:57:00,180
Stop

2307
02:57:00,900 --> 02:57:06,740
I'll it'll it'll be one. Yes. I don't feel like getting one guide about that stupid shit. So I'm just gonna say it now

2308
02:57:07,540 --> 02:57:09,460
um

2309
02:57:09,460 --> 02:57:10,900
None of us

2310
02:57:10,900 --> 02:57:17,300
Really care. You know who I want to do Dom stuff Azura because she's really good at it and you guys don't even know

2311
02:57:17,860 --> 02:57:20,660
We I remember we talked until like a discord call for like three hours

2312
02:57:20,660 --> 02:57:23,700
Just me and her and she was like talking about stuff with me

2313
02:57:24,500 --> 02:57:26,100
um

2314
02:57:26,100 --> 02:57:29,700
And I'm like, what do you know about like Dom stuff? She was like, oh, I know a little bit

2315
02:57:29,700 --> 02:57:33,540
I would read stuff and then I was like, oh, give me an example and then she would just like say stuff to me

2316
02:57:33,540 --> 02:57:35,540
And I'm like what?

2317
02:57:36,340 --> 02:57:40,180
What do you want to do you want to switch job? I'm kidding. Um

2318
02:57:42,180 --> 02:57:47,540
Uh guys, it's not that guys when I bring by the way when I bring up something that might be like a mild

2319
02:57:48,420 --> 02:57:52,740
Irritant to me. You guys don't all have to yes man me like I noticed that's a thing

2320
02:57:52,820 --> 02:57:57,700
I'll be like I'll make it like sometimes stuff hasn't even happened yet and people be like I can't believe

2321
02:57:58,020 --> 02:58:01,540
These shitty human beings. Fuck them. I can't believe it like I remember

2322
02:58:02,100 --> 02:58:04,100
I did when I tweeted that I was gonna be tan

2323
02:58:04,900 --> 02:58:06,340
um

2324
02:58:06,340 --> 02:58:08,340
I was like don't whine about it

2325
02:58:08,660 --> 02:58:12,660
Or like because I don't give a crap and then people are like, oh my god

2326
02:58:13,300 --> 02:58:18,980
The people who are whining right now. I'm like, no, nobody's whining. I'm just saying if you do like you don't

2327
02:58:23,220 --> 02:58:26,660
Yeah, you should be a terrified of a zero. I know you care about me

2328
02:58:27,300 --> 02:58:27,940
It's great

2329
02:58:27,940 --> 02:58:29,060
but like

2330
02:58:29,060 --> 02:58:34,660
You don't have to shit on people that don't exist yet when they happen then you can shit on them. Okay, but like

2331
02:58:35,300 --> 02:58:37,780
I I honestly generally don't get like

2332
02:58:38,740 --> 02:58:44,260
Any hate as much as I did when I first started and that's fine like I get the occasional like troll that's like

2333
02:58:45,620 --> 02:58:50,020
N word and that's all they got but like otherwise I'm good

2334
02:58:50,900 --> 02:58:52,900
You don't have to apologize. You're fine

2335
02:58:53,540 --> 02:58:56,260
Stop it before it happens. I I understand

2336
02:58:56,900 --> 02:58:58,100
um

2337
02:58:58,100 --> 02:59:05,140
But almost I almost realized sometimes that people's reaction to what I'm saying almost makes it like that feeds the trolls more

2338
02:59:05,620 --> 02:59:09,300
Because like if I go into a girl's thread and she's talking about

2339
02:59:09,940 --> 02:59:11,940
how people

2340
02:59:12,340 --> 02:59:14,820
Like to f people who whine for changing

2341
02:59:15,460 --> 02:59:18,740
The characters. I don't know fucking animal for example

2342
02:59:19,300 --> 02:59:22,420
And people are the the thing like oh fuck those people

2343
02:59:22,820 --> 02:59:27,540
I'm gonna be like I'm gonna go troll and act like one of those people right now because I'm an asshole because that's how I am

2344
02:59:28,340 --> 02:59:30,340
um

2345
02:59:31,300 --> 02:59:36,100
Me having been a yes man to a previous streamer who frequently ranted because he turned me into a people

2346
02:59:36,100 --> 02:59:37,140
Please

2347
02:59:37,140 --> 02:59:43,780
principle sweating. Yeah, you don't have to be a yes man to me. I like again. I like your honest opinions

2348
02:59:43,780 --> 02:59:48,100
I like when you have a conversation with me. I love the transparency that we have in this relationship

2349
02:59:48,180 --> 02:59:52,580
I talk to you about my schedule. I find out what you guys like. I tell you what I don't like

2350
02:59:53,220 --> 03:00:00,020
Um, please never take anything. I say personally by the way if I like tease you or bully you or do this or that

2351
03:00:00,420 --> 03:00:05,540
Or if I like scold you in the chat, please don't internalize it. I don't fucking hate you

2352
03:00:05,860 --> 03:00:07,860
I'm just giving you a warning by the way

2353
03:00:08,180 --> 03:00:09,060
um

2354
03:00:09,060 --> 03:00:11,220
If you want you to troll her I get enough of that

2355
03:00:11,220 --> 03:00:16,340
Honestly, the fact that I didn't get a catalog bait thread when I posted my sus thing yesterday

2356
03:00:16,580 --> 03:00:19,940
Was a travesty to be honest with you. I was expecting to be shat on

2357
03:00:20,420 --> 03:00:25,300
But I didn't it didn't happen. Maybe it'll happen in a couple days. Maybe someone's gonna type it up right now. Stop it

2358
03:00:25,860 --> 03:00:27,300
Stop it

2359
03:00:27,300 --> 03:00:30,020
Stop it. Okay, but you guys um

2360
03:00:31,300 --> 03:00:33,300
Yeah, balance is important

2361
03:00:33,780 --> 03:00:36,740
Wait, do you have zebness in your name? Oh, I fucking love

2362
03:00:37,300 --> 03:00:43,940
Organization 13 365 days or 360 whatever the fuck that game is called. It's one of my favorite games because I love more lucha

2363
03:00:45,620 --> 03:00:48,340
I'm manifesting manifesting the trolls manifesting them

2364
03:00:49,380 --> 03:00:54,180
No, I'm kidding. Um, no, honestly, uh, I have had a lot

2365
03:00:54,580 --> 03:00:59,620
Like besides in my maros and like my legit maros, I don't really get anything

2366
03:00:59,940 --> 03:01:04,180
Like I don't get people like adding these stupid shit. I get the occasional troll marrow. You know what?

2367
03:01:04,260 --> 03:01:06,900
Let's I'm gonna check my maros right now. Let's see. Let's see what we got

2368
03:01:09,300 --> 03:01:11,300
I haven't looked at my maros in a couple days

2369
03:01:14,420 --> 03:01:18,740
Let's see how many how many oh my god, I have 550 maros. Um

2370
03:01:19,460 --> 03:01:21,460
Um

2371
03:01:22,420 --> 03:01:25,220
There's a stream idea I would like to see you have a collab with emmy

2372
03:01:25,620 --> 03:01:29,460
Do an introduction to esoterrorism together you and tarot emmy on witchcraft

2373
03:01:30,420 --> 03:01:32,420
You can talk about super downs. That'd be cool

2374
03:01:34,180 --> 03:01:38,820
That'd be cool if we did like a little collab together. Um, like a little slideshow

2375
03:01:41,140 --> 03:01:45,860
I know I know emmy and I think even mercy are like kind of new to it. So

2376
03:01:45,860 --> 03:01:47,860
Um

2377
03:01:49,300 --> 03:01:51,300
I kind of don't want it because I'm very

2378
03:01:51,860 --> 03:01:57,300
I won't lie to you. I'm kind of a gatekeeper when it comes to that because I don't want to like

2379
03:01:58,100 --> 03:01:59,460
um

2380
03:01:59,460 --> 03:02:06,100
People to get the information and just start doing stupid shit because they don't take it seriously and then they accidentally hurt themselves

2381
03:02:06,900 --> 03:02:08,900
Um

2382
03:02:09,940 --> 03:02:11,940
But yeah

2383
03:02:12,580 --> 03:02:15,540
Uh, it's okay to be yourself k famous overrated

2384
03:02:16,580 --> 03:02:18,580
You

2385
03:02:18,900 --> 03:02:20,900
What

2386
03:02:23,700 --> 03:02:28,420
Why did someone just come into my maros and just expose a bunch of people for being males

2387
03:02:34,180 --> 03:02:40,020
For like this this streamer is a male the streamer was a signed male. Why would you I don't okay?

2388
03:02:40,900 --> 03:02:42,900
What

You did it four times good. Whoa, someone wrote me a whole thing

2395

I have some help from some other harlots and vealer fans to read the bible. I'm dyslexic

2396
03:03:26,660 --> 03:03:28,660

03:03:53,620 --> 03:03:56,420
So funny when people call me like compare me to food

2402
03:03:58,260 --> 03:04:00,260

03:04:02,420 --> 03:04:04,420
Sorry, it's been a while

2405
03:04:04,900 --> 03:04:06,900
Oh

2406
03:04:08,260 --> 03:04:10,260
Someone got a cat that's adorable

2407
03:04:11,140 --> 03:04:14,900
Someone loves me and is kissing me a bunch. Oh my god. This is so

2408
03:04:15,780 --> 03:04:19,860
I thought there was a character limit. Oh, they're a verified user

2409
03:04:19,860 --> 03:04:23,140
That's why they were able to bypass the character limit. Holy crap

2410
03:04:25,060 --> 03:04:27,620
All the voices you do are amazing. Oh, thank you

2411
03:04:27,620 --> 03:04:34,260
Mind you are doing great and trash loves you very much with a lovely little cat pucks link

2412
03:04:37,060 --> 03:04:41,700
Hey sheebie, I didn't see a vibe with me option on your house of blue streams

2413
03:04:41,700 --> 03:04:44,820
It allows viewers to also enjoy the vibes along with you

2414
03:04:45,700 --> 03:04:47,700
What?

2415
03:04:50,260 --> 03:04:52,260
Wait, you can do that

2416
03:04:53,140 --> 03:04:55,140
You

2417
03:04:55,540 --> 03:04:57,540
Mercy might be able to help set that up

2418
03:04:59,300 --> 03:05:03,700
What the frick all right, I'll figure mercy does it

2419
03:05:06,180 --> 03:05:08,180
What the hell

2420
03:05:08,580 --> 03:05:13,940
Damn, all right, I'll figure that out. Love the non outfit and voice combo. Oh, thank you

2421
03:05:14,900 --> 03:05:16,900
And the rest is just really bad

2422
03:05:17,780 --> 03:05:23,300
I had horrible stuff for house of blue when bb was streaming that I cannot read out loud

2423
03:05:26,340 --> 03:05:34,900
Forgive me sister bb for I've sinned. I worked my way through college by by showing my body and dancing around a pole for tides to pay my fees

2424
03:05:39,460 --> 03:05:42,660
Okay, cool cool cool. Whoa snap

2425
03:05:43,620 --> 03:05:46,580
Hey madame, can you quickly? No

2426
03:05:47,780 --> 03:05:52,660
I'm not saying that. I don't care. Don't worry. It's not a slur. It means I love you. No, I don't believe you

2427
03:05:54,660 --> 03:05:57,300
I don't believe you at all. What language is this? I'm googling it

2428
03:06:00,660 --> 03:06:02,660
Is that tag along

2429
03:06:02,660 --> 03:06:04,660
Oh

2430
03:06:09,060 --> 03:06:13,060
Yeah, Filipino. All right, mahal kita

2431
03:06:15,540 --> 03:06:17,540
Mahal kita hanam

2432
03:06:17,940 --> 03:06:19,940
Did I spell that right?

2433
03:06:20,420 --> 03:06:22,420
Did I pronounce that right?

2434
03:06:22,740 --> 03:06:24,740
I just didn't try. I don't trust that

2435
03:06:27,380 --> 03:06:29,380
To the safety cuckoo

2436
03:06:30,260 --> 03:06:33,140
Shout out to all my Filipino fans. You're a real one

2437
03:06:35,300 --> 03:06:38,260
Oh, I love how I knew it was tagalog. I'm impressive

2438
03:06:39,460 --> 03:06:40,500
Damn

2439
03:06:40,500 --> 03:06:42,500
I'm a real one

2440
03:06:44,500 --> 03:06:46,500
You can't believe she just said that

2441
03:06:48,500 --> 03:06:50,500
All right, um

2442
03:06:51,140 --> 03:06:55,220
All right. Yeah, see I haven't really had anything like trolling lately. So that's good

2443
03:06:56,100 --> 03:06:58,100
But I'm fine. I'm good

2444
03:06:59,620 --> 03:07:03,780
Oh my do you hear that? That was my collar bone that just popped my chest

2445
03:07:07,380 --> 03:07:09,380
Say a booby

2446
03:07:11,620 --> 03:07:13,620
Booby was that

2447
03:07:14,180 --> 03:07:18,740
His eyes were so big and then he looked at me and he like, you know how cats do a little cat kiss

2448
03:07:18,820 --> 03:07:21,700
Where they squint their eyes and close them slowly. That's what he did to me

2449
03:07:22,420 --> 03:07:26,100
Why are you so sweet? Oh, you're gonna make kitty kisses

2450
03:07:27,060 --> 03:07:29,060
Oh, why is your mouth open?

2451
03:07:30,020 --> 03:07:32,020
why

2452
03:07:32,260 --> 03:07:34,420
Sometimes he just stares at me with his mouth open

2453
03:07:36,020 --> 03:07:38,020
um

2454
03:07:39,780 --> 03:07:43,460

um

2475
03:09:21,300 --> 03:09:25,860
I listened to that because I didn't know what brat summer was. I've only I'm only on the vtuber sphere

2476
03:09:25,860 --> 03:09:27,060
I'm not in the normie sphere

2477
03:09:27,060 --> 03:09:33,060
So I looked up the songs from the album and I'm like one of them which is about her just like doing crack

2478
03:09:33,140 --> 03:09:35,140
I'm just like why is this a banger?

2479
03:09:35,220 --> 03:09:43,220
Why is this you know, we're back in the days of glorifying drug use and songs and mainstream media

2480
03:09:46,820 --> 03:09:50,820
Have you seen bb no money and drag for his music videos? No, what?

2498
03:11:15,300 --> 03:11:17,300
That song is literally a banger though

2499
03:11:20,100 --> 03:11:23,940

2500
03:11:24,660 --> 03:11:26,660

2501
03:11:28,340 --> 03:11:30,340
Think boomie just farted it smells

2502
03:11:31,060 --> 03:11:32,820
You're stinky

2503
03:11:32,820 --> 03:11:35,700
Fia farted twice last night next to my face

2504
03:11:36,660 --> 03:11:38,820
And then I regretted having her close to my face

2505
03:11:39,540 --> 03:11:45,380
What was I doing? I was gonna raid icy. I keep getting distracted and might have headphones in my ears and nothing's even playing

2506
03:11:47,620 --> 03:11:49,860
I can't I can't take it out. It's stuck in my hair

2507
03:11:54,420 --> 03:11:57,060
Have you heard the guess from that element? No

2508
03:11:58,980 --> 03:12:00,980
I don't listen to charlie xcx

2509
03:12:01,380 --> 03:12:05,380
The one time I went on tiktok to upload a tiktok that song came up

2510
03:12:05,380 --> 03:12:10,180
I'm like, this is kind of hard and then I realized what it was about and I'm like should I be listening to this

2511
03:12:11,700 --> 03:12:16,660
Please don't redirect the blame to boomie, but I can't then my cats fart boomie. You're so cute though right now

2512
03:12:16,740 --> 03:12:18,340
Why are you so cute?
