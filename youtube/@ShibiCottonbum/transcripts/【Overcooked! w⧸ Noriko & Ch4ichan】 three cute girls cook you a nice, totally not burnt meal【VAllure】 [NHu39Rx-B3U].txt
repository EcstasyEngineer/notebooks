What the fuck is this?
Australian!
I'm Australian!
See?
See?
I can't, my cheeks hurt too much.
I can only do, like, a southern accent,
but then I get to really racist really fast,
so I won't do that.
Wait, how can...
How is a southern accent racist?
It just brings out the best in me.
Oh, I see what you mean.
Like, it just...
The America just takes over.
Yeah, America, the fucking...
American, I mean.
Today!
Should we normalize Peter Griffin ASMR roleplay?
What?
What?
Peter!
Peter, I don't know why she's...
Hoss is here.
Chad, you should try Scottish.
Can you do a Scottish accent?
Yeah, do it, do it.
Me?
Yes.
Thank you.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, scrolling!
Just scrolling!
Just scrolling!
Does it sound like just mimic Shrek?
Don't care!
Don't care!
Don't care!
What are you doing in my swamp?
Yeah, I'm not swamped.
Or...
Or...
Let's go daddy to Pullman get some...
tall points.
That's right.
Yeah, that's right.
Kind of blends...
Yeah, yeah, I always slip into British
when I try to do Australian or Scottish.
The Yankee, isn't Yankee like the...
the...
New York.
Yeah, yeah, East Coast.
And walk in here.
I'm walking in, I'm walking in!
Yeah, wait me!
They need to turn into Australia?
It just keeps going back?
I can't control it!
Say optimize my performance in a British accent.
What?
Optimize...
Optimize my performance.
Optimize my performance.
Optimize my performance.
Oh, mommy, sweet Jesus.
If I...
If I was a boy, if I was a boy,
my weenie would be very wrecked.
It's a really stigma card, you.
My clip just jumped.
This is really deactivating you.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
What does that even mean?
Is this German accent?
I can't do it.
I can't do German.
I think I can do it.
I think I really have to focus,
and then it comes out.
It's like out of my control sometimes.
Who can make the most racist accent challenge?
I got you.
Probably Nori.
Probably Nori.
Right.
Actually...
I definitely can.
Southern...
Dad, I'm down in Texas today.
All right, that's pretty good.
I'm gonna get in my truck,
and I'm gonna go get some guns.
You're gonna get some guns?
I love Americans.
I love me and my guns.
I love being American.
My first amendment right is my pistol whipping guns.
I have a large gun point.
You know the Capitol.
Choo!
Yeah, let's go raid the Capitol.
No, no, Tommy.
Let's go storm that Capitol building.
Let's go storm that Capitol building.
Oh, yeah, let...
Yee-haw, let's do that.
Yeah, let's do that.
What gun would I use?
I would use an AK-47 or a military-grade gun.
I'll tell you what.
I'll tell you what.
I'll tell you what.
I'll tell you what.
I'll tell you what.
I'll use a goddamn military-grade gun
if I have to shoot down the goddamn...
Games?
Yeah, shoot down the range.
Take advantage of the second amendment.
I love taking advantage of the second amendment.
What's the second amendment?
I think it's like guns.
I think it's the right to bear arms.
No, America.
I love eagles.
I love eagles.
Well, I love eagles and I love...
It's my sister.
What's that kilometer?
I don't know American freedom units.
Artificial flavors.
Artificial flavors.
I'll go Alabama.
I'll go Alabama if she be right now.
I'll tell you what right now.
I love my mother.
K-Y-S, which means kiss your sister.
Don't mind if I fucking do.
I'll true, I'll true that.
True that, true that.
Someone asked in your chat,
what D&D race and class would you all play?
Necromancer.
And I'd be like the smallest class ever.
So a half-foot or a dwarf.
But I'd be a necromancer.
I was also going to say necromancer
and I'd probably just be an elf.
Wait, what's the question?
Oh, what D&D class and race would you be?
Oh, I would be a dark elf rogue.
I totally see that, yeah.
Gonna be black?
Are you black?
I think we've already established
that Chai has wanted to be black this entire stream.
Oh my god, he's not swear.
He loves you so much.
Chai wants to race mix.
It's a coincidence, it's a coincidence.
She wants to make many versions of me.
Ever since I was young, I felt like I was Japanese.
That's so true.
In every state but physical, I am Japanese.
Hi.
I represent Japanese.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm all level.
I'm all level.
I'm all level.
I'm all level.
You're so dead to your heart.
I am a wolf.
Is that the CbCottenbum and Chai?
Oh yeah, I guess I'm fucking Rico, I guess.
Fuck me, I guess, man.
Fuck.
Fuck the person.
Well, I don't know where to look.
Someone went inside the CbCottenbum and Chai.
Yeah, please.
Why is there two of me?
Oh, one more moment.
Why not two of you?
There was two of me for a second on my stream.
What would Chai look like if she was white or Chinese?
Well, she's white now.
No, no, no, they think I'm brown.
Keep it up, keep it up.
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
This is what you would look like if you were white or Chinese.
Yeah, I only hang out with streamers that fake the rig.
Yeah, we're all beautiful, Aryan queens, blue eyes, blonde hair, pale, pale skin.
Like you can see our veins.
I'm actually pretty light-skinned, but you can see my veins and I get made fun of.
Now, I turn over my arm and my veins are like very matte.
People are like, good veins, little lady, your veins are so good.
That's when they draw your blood.
Do you have blue veins?
I have green.
I got blue and green.
Yeah, I have green.
Oh, wow, we got a mixture.
Maybe it's because I'm white and black.
Wow, that's all you're talking about.
You're a race, race mixer.
I'm a race mixer.
My parents, they, their loves surpassed race and segregation and they made me.
Disgusting, you're an abominant.
Oh, wait.
You're an abominant.
I'm so sorry, Chai.
What would you guys, okay, in like a casual way, like, what would animal do you most associate?
What's your spirit animal?
Oh, my, my hamster.
Hamster?
Yeah, because I think, I think hamsters die in the most obscure way.
So I feel like my owner would throw me at a wall and I would just go splat and like crumble and die.
I'd be like a pathetic excuse of a hamster.
I wouldn't be able to do anything.
So that's why it's your spirit animal.
Because they're pathetic.
Yeah, just like me.
What are you guys?
What are you guys guys?
I don't know what the fuck I was saying.
I'm just laughing too much.
I can't even answer.
Chibi thought she was the one who was edgy.
No, I know the moment I had, I was going to have Noria in my stream,
that you guys are going to fucking love her because how face she is.
And that's a great juxtaposition to Chai, who is so sweet.
You would think she'd be edgy with how she looks, but it's the pink one.
It's always the fucking pink one, isn't it?
It's always the fucking pink one.
It's always the fucking the pink woman.
Well, you're a purple woman.
I'm glad if you do.
Yeah.
No, I don't know.
I just think about it a lot.
Like if I was like, if I was a hamster, I would genuinely
I would genuinely die.
I don't know.
My owner would be too loud and I would just have a hard time.
I would just die.
My owner would bring a girl home and I'd kill myself like in my little cage or something.
I don't know.
Like I.
What?
What about you guys?
Dude?
Yeah, she knows this.
I want to pretend it.
I think on all levels, except physical, I'd be a wolf.
What?
I'm fucking a wolf.
I was a fucking role player for like 10 years.
I can't.
Wait, wait, yes.
I can't do that.
Yes, yes, yes.
Wait, I was a warrior cat's role player for so long.
Oh my god, no way.
Yes.
See, let's let it go.
Oh my gosh.
Can we start our own clan?
Yes.
I want to be Chai Pa or Chai Leaf.
I'm going to call you Chai Leaf.
That's actually really cute.
I guess I would be like cotton pick.
No, sorry.
I'll be cotton, cotton.
It's a perfect name for you.
Cotton bum.
Cotton bum.
Yeah, you just literally wouldn't have a furring.
What would my warrior cat name be?
I don't know.
Because when I was a kid, we role played like Naruto.
So I was like.
I also did that.
I also larped, you know, Naruto.
Yeah, I've larped enemies like a fucking loser.
Why does everyone have a membership?
Because they want to support me.
The.
Yeah.
Get out of here.
Gray name.
Yeah, leave my leave my leave my mommy alone.
Thank you for that.
You leave my you leave my mommy alone.
I love my mommy.
My sweet precious children.
Wait, so would you be a cat then, Chai?
Honestly, I think I always thought honestly.
I don't know.
I think I'd be a bunny.
Oh my gosh.
No way.
Be a bunny.
Yeah, I actually do think so.
I think I think a bunny.
That's cute.
You kind of almost have like floppy ears,
like like mine with your pigtails.
Yeah, too.
The floppy.
Because your hair is super long.
We're actually, I'm looking at us.
We're very similar, similar color palette.
Looks like a flat version of you.
My hair is just a little bit more blonder.
And I'm just going to canonically adopt you
and say that I slept with harem, a demonic harem.
Yeah, demonic harem.
That's why you have horns.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, mommy.
We're going to adopt you.
Flap is justice.
Speaking of justice, we overlapped with their diffuse today.
I'll have to go back and watch the VODs.
We are cute.
I want to, I want to, I want to,
I want to be adopted with a hat.
You're my pet, you're my pet bug from the garden.
Remember, I keep you in my palm.
From the garbage.
From the garbage.
From the garbage.
This, this pocket has a lot of lint
and like those cool little crumbs in it.
And that's okay.
Some moss and stuff.
It's okay.
You can crawl around and ride between my boobies and stuff.
I did that during your debut, by the way.
Yours and Azura's.
I sat on your top.
I think I actually saw that in the, uh,
when I watched your VOD back.
That's right.
I heard Azura's voice.
I'm so sorry.
She's not here.
Thank God.
I heard Azura's voice and good lord.
If I, if I was a man, if I was a man,
I'm telling you the things I would do,
I would do for that woman.
Oh, wow.
She does have like, when I first heard her voice,
I almost, I almost died and went to heaven
because it's just pure sex.
I wanted to lift those things up and just
look at the sweat between them.
I don't know, man.
And she just, she just makes me a different person
thinking about her.
I want a voice like that.
Right.
Like she's, I don't know, man.
She was cooler, whatever, but Azura.
That's true.
I can't really compete with her voice.
Oh, sure.
But her voice surpasses.
Now, but you're, but you're, but you're my Oshi.
I'm your Oshi?
Yeah, you're my Oshi.
You're fucking lying.
Don't say that.
Oh, I'm going to cry.
Toma told me the same thing and I'm,
I'm literally going to lose it.
I'm going to cry into my pillow because they
don't deserve anybody's love.
Yep.
Yeah, you're right.
Who's who?
The really white one either we go.
And the beautiful, sexy blonde here,
devil girl.
I'm really cute.
Devil boy.
Here's his tie.
Sexy.
I got sexy.
She's a sexy little thing.
My sexy, my sexy daughter.
Whoa.
Yeah.
And the pet bug, I guess.
And my, um, garbage.
No, that's worse.
I prefer, I prefer, uh, she's just my little,
my little buggy daughter.
Um, no, the vaude is not getting nuked.
The vaude is not getting nuked.
Woo!
The first one!
First one you can keep up.
Wait, do you have to nuked vods?
I, I usually have to like cut or edit vods
or delete them completely because I will
just say really dumb shit that I'm not
supposed to say on YouTube.
But I say even more worse shit than I did on Twitch.
The price you pay.
I don't even know why.
Okay.
I didn't know that.
Yeah.
You should watch, uh, honestly,
Nori, you should play Class of 09.
I know you'd like that game.
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a visual novel elitist,
so I don't play anything that gets like
touched by normies, I guess.
Like once it's in a normie scene, I'm like,
I definitely don't think it's a normie game.
I don't think it's a normie game.
I, I, I've seen it.
I like visual novels.
Maybe I'll play it one day.
Yeah.
I highly, I think you're-
I feel like if I play it, I start crying.
Yeah.
I would like to see the both of you play it,
or maybe we'll do a collab where you, we go through,
we go through, uh, the visual novel
and just commentate on it.
That would be funny.
You would love that.
What's an Oshi again?
An Oshi is like, it's, okay,
it's like a huge dork for people that are new TV to be.
It is idol culture thingy.
So you have like, kind of like in K-pop,
you have a bias.
It's like one person in like maybe a group
or like an individual that you really, really enjoy
and you are constantly keeping like up with.
So like, my Oshi would be Chibi.
You know what I mean?
Like, I keep up with Chibi,
but my Kami Oshi is like, Ina.
I have so much Ina merch.
It's so bad.
I made for Chibi to make merch.
I didn't know that, uh, your, your Kami Oshi was Ina.
That's actually cute.
I do have-
Make myself purple for like,
every Vtuber that I've liked so far is purple.
So I just make myself purple.
Now that I really think about it.
All my favorite Vtubers are purple.
You're the only red Vtuber that I like.
I was supposed to be purple.
Look! I'm leaving!
I'm leaving!
You're my, there's, wait,
but Ty, you're my friend.
And Oshi will never notice me.
You're the only red Vtuber.
You're in-
Oh!
I meant my Oshi's.
I meant my Oshi's.
I meant my Oshi's.
He's sitting there.
Oh, okay, okay.
She's like, I like you.
Um, but yes, I do have merch since you mentioned that.
My merch is in my description.
A wink.
You can get your own, own a hole.
I'm kidding.
That's not true.
What?
You know-
No!
I actually, I might, I might buy it.
See, if you make my keychains and pins,
just ping me,
because I'll make a bag dedicated to you.
Aw, thank you.
That's really, very nice.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm like a really big j-
like fucking, what is it?
I don't nerd.
Sort of this like,
I'm, I'm sorry if I'm rambling.
I know.
Um, it's really, it's really cute when people have like bags,
like eat a bag.
So there's like a thing where it's literally the same merch
and one bag.
I didn't know that was-
I forgot what they're called.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So if you do that, let me know.
I have three for Ena.
That's really cute.
I didn't know that, Nori.
That's so adorable.
Hey, you just, yeah, this is just,
let me know.
I'm like, I like, I like pins and keychains.
Pick you up and smush you against my bosom.
You're so fucking adorable.
I would genuinely love that.
If you start feeling biting, ignore that.
Oh.
Don't say Ona Oshihou.
That's disgusting.
This is a safer work chat.
You hear that?
I may be screaming with a woman that does-
I might be a woman of the night,
but the other girls are not.
They don't do the sort of content I do.
So please do not think or assume or give them,
like, or sexually harass them or anything
because they don't make that content.
They're just, you're, you know, sweet, say-so.
In some ways.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, you're talking about us.
You're talking about us.
Oh, yeah.
I'm just edgy, ma'am.
What's the difference?
I don't know.
Once you get into the private chat in my Discord,
it's a little crazy.
Is it girl-central?
Once you get into VC with me, it's bad.
Groom!
Are you getting groomed by your moths?
No, you have to do the grooming yourself.
Honestly, Chai-Chai would do the grooming.
She just, like, she comes off as like,
I'm so sweet and innocent,
and then she'll just fucking groom the fuck out of you.
I'd be okay with that.
Same.
I'm here.
I'd be okay.
I don't know what I should say.
All right, Chai-Chai.
Uh-uh.
Let me, uh, look at the-
Oh, no.
Oh, my God.
And say thank you.
I feel kind of bad,
because I feel like I rumble a lot.
Oh, Chai-Chai.
You're fine.
I feel the same thing.
My-my chat knows-
Chai-Chai, this is our podcast.
You can say whatever you want.
My chat knows how much I app, so they-
They-
I guess.
Love you and Chai for the same reason.
Why do you act like I don't watch your streams?
Woman, I'm there.
I know that.
I'm there.
What do you mean?
I haven't seen your name!
Are you lurking?
Oh, I just look type.
God.
Okay.
Because I want to-
I get-
I get scared when people notice me.
I don't-
Actually, I feel the same way, so-
Okay, I'll never notice you ever.
I'll never perceive you.
No!
It's like, I don't want to explain it,
because then sometimes their chat starts talking to you,
and you're like,
oh, my God, please don't.
Please, I want to pee everywhere.
Don't do this.
You're gonna pee everywhere?
Yeah, I know what you mean.
Sometimes when you-
It's like, it's-
It's exciting when you talk in a French chat,
because then you're like,
oh, my God, hi!
But then you're like, oh, no, I'm like,
I don't know.
It's like-
Because like, you're taking away a pension from-
Yeah, yeah, yeah, right?
This was really bad.
I felt like, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah.
That's why I usually only say one or two things,
because I don't-
Like, especially with my gen mates,
because sometimes people move the chat's focus on me.
So I'm just like, I'll say hi,
and then I'll be like-
Yeah, quiet.
Quiet.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're gonna be like, yeah.
What?
Were you just underwater?
Oh, it's hilarious.
Someone in my mic panel kills itself.
Oh, so I just noticed-
Can you guys hold your arms?
Yeah, I'm Hispanic.
Try.
Sorry.
I'm so sorry you're Hispanic.
Yeah, my bad.
I'm sorry, guys.
I am-
I'm sorry.
I know.
I know.
I'm gonna hold the box and see.
Ha-ra, ha-ra, ha-ra.
Ha-ra.
Rrrr.
Ha-ra, ha-ra-ee-ba.
Ha-ra-ee-ba.
I want to learn how to purr.
Rrr.
Rrr.
Rrr.
Rrr.
Rrr.
Rrr.
Rrr.
Rrr.
Rrr.
Rrr.
Rrr.
Rrr.
It's the favorite word.
Rrr.
OK.
Hold on.
I'm gonna definitely say thank yous for Dota's and shit.
I'll be right back.
Okay, go do it.
Do it.
I love them so much there.
Oh my God.
I'm so thankful to have them as friends.
It's been a deep up too strong.
It's been a good present.
Yeah, that's what the conversation
will turn to with these two.
But thank you, Charlie.
She'd be pleased for giving me
from about to do bark, bark, bark, bark.
Thank you for the five bucks.
But thank you for the shibbity toilet.
Thank you for the tip, boy.
She'd be playing with her two daughters, so wholesome.
Thank you for the $20 two-tool, beep, beep, bless.
I haven't heard that in a long time.
Please let Nori know.
She has a whole paper set in her, your chat.
She can risen up.
Oh, she knows, she knows.
Thank you, Morgan.
But thank you guys.
I already know that you guys are having as much fun as me.
I don't even have to ask.
All right, watch, I'm an undefined
and they're probably me saying the most ridiculous shit.
It's like, oh, nice, happy, happy times.
That's exactly just how it feels sometimes.
Yeah, I had a nap.
I also had a nap.
I was scared I wasn't gonna wake up in time for the collab.
But I was genuinely like, if I sleep now,
I don't know if I'll wake up on time.
Yeah, I set an alarm.
I feel like, yeah, you know when you have those naps
where it's like you're, oh, home.
She back?
I went back.
I was just like, I was like listening to you guys talk.
Oh, cute.
To each other about her napping.
I'm talking about her napping.
I had really stressful dreams because like,
I feel like I went, I napped.
Like, I was like, okay, I have to like get up
after this stuff.
I have to, oh wait, raid, raid, raid.
Wait, oh my God, raid.
Hold on a second.
Oh, she's gone.
Thank you for the raid.
Thank you for the raid.
Oh my God.
Oh, she's muted.
What the fuck?
She's like, I disappeared.
She was shrimped.
What was it gonna say?
I take naps all the time.
I have a nap time schedule.
Like a pod board.
I've napped for like probably three hours today.
So that's why I don't know why I'm still so tired.
Yeah, I sleep at three or five.
No, in between, I'm just a child.
I know it's hard because I stream in my time slot
at the same time that I would normally nap.
So I have to nap earlier.
So then I sleep later or I nap later
and I sleep later and then I wake up at like 11.
I don't go to sleep until like five a.m.
and then I wake up at like 10 a.m., 10 p.m., 10 a.m.
all the time.
I have a horrible sleep schedule.
Don't nod.
I'm sorry, I've been yawning.
I'm yawning.
So I'm sorry.
Container.
You didn't go while you didn't go.
I'm boring or something.
No, I love you, stop.
Me, me, me, me.
Also, I'm so sorry, it's hair on my hair.
Yeah, hair on my hair.
Oh my God.
I made your, you're too much stream-solid.
It's the only time slot I'm available.
It's fine, they understand.
No, it's, you're guilty about it.
No, I don't feel guilty.
They're, I bet they believe that it was worth it
so they got to meet you and try.
So.
I hope so.
Yep.
I hope they liked it.
Yeah, I hope they did.
I'm just not, I'm gonna be all sad
when I lie being around you.
No.
Yes, I missed you.
I missed you a bunch.
All right.
No, you didn't miss me.
We just met.
We just met.
What am I talking about?
We just met.
We spent a little night.
You just met.
It's just the dreams.
You've just been in my dreams.
So it feels like we've known each other for months.
You've worked with me in my dreams.
What's happened to dreams, really?
I can tell you one of them.
I'm actually, I've had dreams.
It was weird though, cause he felt like,
you know, like you ever have like,
it's like we were an animic.
It was like in the real world.
So it was like you, but I was like a real person.
I don't know how to explain it.
Was I white or was I brown?
You were kind of tanned.
You were like tan.
Interesting.
You were like a tan.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But, but there was like a weird dream
and we were just talking to me
and like you were holding my hand.
I was like, oh my God.
She's touching me.
Oh my God.
Yeah, like she's touching me.
She's touching my hands.
Oh my, oh my days.
Oh, good Lord.
Oh my days.
I would love to go to a convention with you.
That'd be fun.
There's, I am hopefully planning to go to one.
I don't think you are,
I don't think your place of work is very far
from my little, my little hole in the hole.
Hi!
Hi, Ty.
Oh, did you guys know that I quit my job?
Yeah, I saw that.
Yeah, I saw that.
So I can, I can probably just
chalk myself across the states and go to you.
Wait, we're meeting in person?
No, I mean, like we're just,
she was telling me she had a dream
that we went to a con together.
And I was like, oh, I love what we're talking.
Koreans grind, Koreans grind.
Thank you for the follow.
Oh, oh, I was like, oh, good about Korean's that grind.
Oh, I love Korean's.
Wait, Noriko, someone said more,
Noriko, more like stinky co.
I just thought you should know that.
I learned them.
Who said that?
Who said that?
Give me, give me.
Their names?
Self mechanic.
I was going to ban them,
but they're a certified tune,
but I don't think I should ban them.
No, you should just
flick them really hard in the forehead.
Why in the forehead?
Because that's where I remember my mom was.
Oh, you said flick them.
I've heard something else.
Yeah, you flick them in the forehead.
I thought you said fuck them in the forehead
and I was a little bit confused.
Oh, I guess from like the lobotomy.
Oh, yeah, there you go.
Well, that's kind of like the eye socket.
Doll spoon.
Oh, that's such silly little names, huh?
Okay, are we going to a con?
I want to go to a con with you guys.
Do you guys like the cosplay?
Do you guys like the cosplay?
I'm too.
I do like the cosplay.
I cosplayed myself.
They're so good.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Huge boobies.
You have pictures.
I just noticed that one of you guys
sounds like Ruby Rose from Ruby.
Which one?
I don't think it's me.
Huh?
I get told I sound like Mabel in Peridot.
Oh, you do?
Oh, that's actually true.
Oh my God, that's so true.
You sound like Peridot.
That's so real.
I know, I get to sound like Peridot a lot.
Wait, who do I sound like?
Who do I sound like?
I want to sound like you from Ruby.
I think they say, yeah, they think you
sound like Ruby Rose from Ruby.
That's cool.
Me?
Yeah, you.
Ruby Rose?
Ruby Rose?
Is that the girl with the red hair?
Yeah, black and red?
Oh, she has some color palette, too.
Oh my gosh.
I got to hurt the typing.
Wait, like Ruby Rose, like Ruby Rose,
like the not like the Australian model in action.
No, not.
No, no, no, Ruby Rose.
You sound just like her when you do your Australian accent.
How do you do that?
Australia.
What?
Australia.
Australia.
Australia.
My chat also agrees that they kind of hear the Ruby.
Who's Ruby?
Kind of, who is it?
Ruby Rose.
Oh, you know, oh, I send it to you.
It's a little like red girl, is it not?
With the red hair.
I never watch Ruby, so I don't know.
Not gonna go.
Guys, I'm feeling stupid.
Oh, that girl.
Also, wait, Chai, do you?
Oh, wait.
What the fuck is this GIF?
You cost, it's from the show.
The show sucks, by the way.
I didn't watch the first season.
Chai, did you watch the show?
I was really proud.
Have I?
Yeah.
I want you so bad, I beg and I plead and I pray and I ask.
It's just a lot because of the jacket.
I gotta get the jacket commissioned.
That's true.
But everything else I can figure out,
like 3D printing, like certain parts,
and like the cuffs and the chains.
You know how to 3D print?
I can, I have the ability to.
I don't have a 3D printer, but I know someone who does.
Oh, that's pretty cool.
And I get down on my hands and knees and say, please.
Please.
I think it would work out.
I do cosplay, though.
I just got back from a convention.
I cosplayed three different ladies.
I was freerun, freerun.
Oh my gosh, you would be so good as freerun.
I did her dinner, dinner.
Oh my gosh, I have to.
I can show you guys pictures.
Please.
Yeah, I think they're really appropriate.
I have a blue archive cosplay that just arrived of Hoshino.
And I also cosplayed a chopper from One Piece.
Oh, that's funny.
Oh, that's funny.
Do you have pictures of that one?
Yeah, I'm getting into One Piece.
I'm still getting into One Piece.
Yeah.
I watched the Netflix live action.
Yeah, that was pretty good.
It hooked me in like, OK, now I have to kind of watch the show.
Oh, yeah, I did watch the live action, too, yeah.
I would love to cosplay, but I have really bad anxiety,
so I don't leave my home enough to do that.
I haven't cosplayed in years at an actual convention.
It's been a very, very long time.
It's a whole other night.
Cosplaying at home is a lot less exhausting.
I don't know.
It's just like, I guess the fear of buying a cosplay
and then be like, I should have, like, work with you.
Oh, like, yeah, if it doesn't get all the money right.
My boobs usually don't fit into a lot of things,
so I'd have to play a very big, boobed character.
Yeah, I have that problem, too.
I have that problem, too.
Yeah.
My point.
Yeah.
Chai's body type is essentially her model, Koff.
It's really sad.
My model is taller, though.
I think my model would probably fit into cosplays
better than I could, just because of me.
I think I'm smaller.
She's so small.
It's like, sucks.
Yeah.
It's like, oh, cute.
There are a lot of really cute characters in my opinion.
I feel like you can ask me a lot of hard things.
Sometimes they make the small.
Sometimes the small isn't even, like, small.
I don't know.
I think I'm just, I'm just stubby.
No, I'm stubby.
For me, it's a lot of the time the cosplay parents
never go past my buttocks.
She's got a fat ass.
Yeah, my bag.
Yeah, yeah.
She's small with a fat ass.
Wait, don't be boob fat ass.
And let me have you.
You need to, man, too.
And then your little cute pet hunt.
OK, I'm also kind of, I'm also kind of pet-on,
so it's fine.
Yeah, you're also a pet-on, yeah.
Now we start that in sim.
It's just my butt.
That's the Hispanic jeans.
Just hit her there.
Yeah, it's just my butt.
I don't know why.
I don't understand.
I also haven't cosplayed in a long time
because people sometimes when you're brown
and you cosplay a white character.
Oh my god, it's so bad.
They just bitch and moan and I'm like, I don't.
Yeah.
You get called like the hard-art name version
of the character.
It's so, it's so, it's so mad.
It's like, damn, it's like they kind of got me there.
They'll be like, N-word, Shinobi or something like that.
I think I've seen that for like Gojo when somebody was
cosplaying as Gojo.
That's like the one thing that works.
No, no, no, I've seen somebody like a black Gojo
and people just fucking ragged on them.
It's ridiculous.
The cosplay community is like, it's just, you know,
like the cosplay community just kind of sucks.
Like it's very toxic and it's not warm and fuzzy
for the most part, but I can tell you.
Which is sucks because it's like, OK, this is not really weird.
I think when anime got mainstream and all the very
attractive people started doing cosplay,
it kind of ruined the vibe of like, oh, it's just a bunch
of nerds having fun together.
I agree, but it's like, when anime-
It's like Hot Girl Central.
Yeah, because it's like, in my opinion,
I appreciate like a more like messy looking cosplay
because like you can tell that they really like the character
than like a full blown, like full glam cosplay
because it's just for photo shoots.
Like, um, anime becoming popular sucks, it's so bad.
It's like retubing, too.
Like, it's so bad.
It's very mainstream, though.
It's sad. It is sad.
And it sucks to like say it because then you sound like
like a gatekeeper, like even gatekeeper.
But it's like, but it's true.
It is true because like the feeling of like the anime,
the community, the cosplay community and all that, like,
it was so different before like 2020, I'd say, like 20.
Yeah, 2020, like right around the pandemic,
when it did get really popular.
It was like, oh my God, yay.
All the people who bullied me, like finally, like,
now you guys can see it's cool.
But at the same time, like a lot of, yeah.
But yeah, exactly right.
Like, God damn, this is like, this is my thing.
It's like, yay, I know, it's supposed to be my thing,
where I was supposed to be like this little geek.
Like, they do it better because they're like hot and sexy
and like have a lot of.
It also sucks that a lot of anime is going to be very weird
and have very like obscure themes.
And then people are like, this is disgusting.
And it's like, even then, it's like, I could,
there's some anime that I'm like, you know,
that's a little too weird for my taste,
but I'm not going to show people that, like,
it's like the weird, like, puritan thing
people have going on with, and like just the anime.
Yeah.
And then like, oh my God,
so I could talk about this topic for hours.
It's like a different kind of like,
cause it's like initially, like it was like,
oh, I feel embarrassed that I like this stuff
because they're bullying me for liking anime.
Yeah.
But now that they know, it's like they have
all these things to say, like, oh, this is wrong.
You can't like this, but you can't like this.
You can't like this, you can't like this.
Like now that they're like, you know,
they're more familiar with it.
Yeah, they're dictating what's wrong.
It's like, no, no, no, no.
Happening with visual novels as well.
I have noticed that I've seen some stuff.
And it's really bad, cause in my opinion,
visual novels is the one medium
where people can be really weird.
There are some really like weird, disturbing visual novels
and people are like, oh, but the girls are cute,
but this game is so icky and gross.
You know, the place is weird.
It's like, maybe you look into the characters
before you're like, I'm in a cosplay-less character.
Yeah.
Saiyan Uta Kof Kof.
I think Afumo is,
Afumo should have never existed for Saiya.
I know, I was, I saw seeing a lot about that
on my timeline, just like Saiya blowing up and-
Yeah, Saiya's blowing up and people that hate the things
that Saiya talks about are like, I love Saiya.
She's so cool.
And it's like, you would not like the game,
but it's okay.
But then anime and VTuber are coming mainstream
was a mistake.
Gay keep it.
Push the little show.
Gay keep it, let's gay keep.
It's like, I don't want to gay keep,
cause it's like, I think it's fun to like
see VTuber merge in public,
but then it's like, it sucks when people are like,
this VTuber isn't talking about these things.
But VTuber does this thing, and it's like,
you know.
Everything feels so restricting, cause it's like,
oh, I feel like I have these rules to follow.
Or it's like, before I didn't feel like there was any rules,
I could just be like-
You need to be a little dork with other dorks
and having fun.
Be a little dork.
Yeah.
Yeah, you kind of put more under a microscope.
She's getting a figure too.
I know, that's like gonna be awful.
Plus Saiya's getting a figure?
Again, yeah, it's cause she got popular again.
It's such a hell of a lot of love.
It's such a hell of a lot of love.
It's such a hell of a lot of love.
It's such a hell of a lot of love.
What, what, what, what?
What, what, what?
That's the part where we all just like make weird noises.
Yeah, I know, I know.
Oh, I know.
I'm just very, I'm very passionate about my enemies
and my enemies' topic.
I don't know.
So all your enemies, I like weird.
Sunshine smiles, what about that?
Yeah, it's true, like fruit baskets.
Yeah!
Would they want more in this world?
No, they would want kindness and happiness.
Aw.
Happy, happy, smile, a little bunny cuteness.
It's real.
I watched Fritz basket in the longest time.
I literally, somebody snapped me back in to remind me
of like, Natalia acts as powers.
And I was like, holy crap.
Oh my god, Natalia!
Yeah, I know, right?
I think everyone can agree that Natalia did not age well.
No!
But Fritz could not admit that's one of the reasons.
No one talks about it.
Nobody, it's OK, it's fine.
I think that, I was really happy that Fritz basket got it.
Because Fritz basket was the first, like the original Fritz
basket was the first anime I ever watched.
So like, when I got a remake, I was really scared because I
was like, I can mess this up so bad.
I haven't watched the remake.
Is it good?
Yeah, I didn't watch the first season because I was like,
well, I feel like I already knew everything that happened.
But I watched the second season, third season,
and it was so good.
And I cried, and I was like, oh my god, happy.
I have to watch it.
It follows the manga a lot more.
I do recommend it if you have the time.
I will say, new romance anime for, OK.
I think you guys want to understand more.
Anime has become more for male, so it's
very hard to get female-centered romance anime.
Oh, like, so-so.
Yes, because if it's for men, no offense,
because there's some anime that are like, harrowing for guys.
And I'm like, oh, this is so great.
Like, 100 girlfriends that I really like you?
Great anime.
That was so cute.
Please watch an anime.
It's so good.
But I feel like we need more anime like Futsu Baskets
and Nana and Paradise Kiss for women.
I know.
That'll never happen.
I feel like I wonder if we'll ever return.
But then there's like, I feel like all the mangas that
would be the same, they're not going to get adapted
because they're so old and no one talks about them anymore.
Or they're too small and obscure.
They have no English translation, so it's no point.
I'm reading your chat, but I'm not this and guys
that like, show Joe, I don't, I think you misinterpreted.
I'm saying not a lot of anime's art, like, for women,
like, like, or on Host Club.
I miss Aura.
Things like that.
Oh, my God.
I miss Aura.
I miss Aura.
Peach Girl, like, we're missing, like, we're missing the female,
like, for the female fans.
And it's not the same.
You know what I mean?
You need some of the for the girlies, you know?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That is really scary.
Kimi ni todoke, it's the romance one.
She has, like, long, straight, black hair.
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
What's that one about?
Yes.
I think she's like popular boy and she's like weird, scary girl,
but they end up together.
Oh, yes, I heard about that one.
I haven't watched it though.
It's literally the anime of fucking miscommunication.
They're really, she's so mean.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
My dress of darling is such a guy anime.
I am so sorry.
Oh, yeah, that one has fanservice.
Yeah, that's for guys.
That one's like, yeah.
So the difference between, oh my gosh, I look such a dork.
The difference between female and male-centered animes
is that male-centered animes will have a lot of, like,
unnecessary fan service for the girls.
And then, like, the girl ones are like,
oh, holy shit, the beach episode is your fan service.
But the beach episode is always, like, a part of the plot.
Like, in Oron Coast Club, they go into, like, the little water
park.
Or, like, I think of, like, animes, like,
do you guys remember Free?
Like, that was, like, a big one.
Yes.
Free was supposed to be a yowie anime, by the way.
Yeah, or, like, it played against it.
It was, like, a tease the whole time.
I remember fucking being obsessed with that.
But it's, like, usually.
Who did you ship?
Was it Rin Haru or Mako Haru?
Oh, no, yeah.
What did you say?
Both.
Both?
Yeah, I think I was Rin Haru.
Oh, Nagisa on the blue-haired guy with the glasses.
That was my, like, oh, chin.
Wait, wait, wait.
Who was your first character you shipped together?
Wait, what'd you say?
You're both first characters you shipped together.
Like, in general.
He could have caught him.
Wait, what?
He could have caught him?
He could have caught him?
Are you kidding?
Oh, so true.
That's a lie.
Yeah, I'm glad you're right.
I wanted you to ship them, though.
Yeah, but they literally, like, sleep together naked.
Listen, my young brain did not care.
And, you know, Twinsist is Winsist.
I do love that, I mean, I think it also
eats pretty bad things.
Oh, yeah, 100%.
What about you, Chai?
See it again?
The first two characters you ever shipped together?
First two characters I ever shipped together was Fruitsbasket.
It would have been Yuki and Toru.
OK, OK, OK.
That's cute.
And then Honey Senpai and Mori Senpai.
Oh, yes.
I also shipped a thousand, like, millions.
I'm going to tell you mine.
And this is the reason why I asked this question,
because mine's is really bad.
OK.
I want to know.
So mine's was SpongeBob and Squidward.
Oh, we're going that far back?
Oh, I thought we were in the context of anime.
Oh, no, no, I said first, not anime.
Anime is different.
Anime, mine's was SpongeBob and Squidward.
Mine's was going crazy.
They're very confused.
And I would always draw them kissing.
And I would, like, follow Japanese artists and, like,
things like that.
And then I went down the Tom and Jerry
pipeline of, like, Japanese artists.
And they still draw them together until this day.
SquidBob.
Yeah, I was like, SquidBob or SpongeWade.
Mine, if it wasn't anime related, I'm like.
It's just any media.
Any media that you, like, consumed so much,
there was, like, yeah.
I'm like, was it, like, Starfire and Raven?
From Teen Titans, I don't know.
Oh, that's good, that's good.
Yeah, I can't recall.
I'm too old for that at the age of 56.
Damn, sorry.
Cosmo and Timmy.
You know, I see, I was thinking that, too.
Like, first, when I was trying to think back,
I'm like, was that Cosmo?
Oh, yeah, Cosmo and Timmy, I think.
No, I got to think about that hard.
I feel like I wasn't, like, in the shipping mindset.
I was just like, yeah, TV on my screen.
TV on my screen.
I can tell you what moment made me ship them together.
Please tell me.
I know exactly.
It's so bad.
So when SpongeBob finds him eating a crabby patty,
and he's like, you like them, don't you screw him.
He's going on fairies with Lesley.
Oh, yes, I remember this one.
I was in, like, my anime phase, so I saw that,
and I was like, yeah, this is peak.
This is my OTP.
Yeah, this is my OTP, and I have, like, a fan page for them.
My friend Kumi, she's in chat right now,
and she said Mr. Krabson Plankton.
Oh, that's a good one.
That's a really good one.
But, no, it wasn't the inflation part.
It wasn't when he was fat.
It was like, he was just, like, eating it,
and he was like, oh, you like them, don't you screw him.
He's like, no, I don't.
And then I thought of, like, an anime
where they, like, kabadon each other.
And then, you know, last year, I was like, oh, my god,
what did SpongeBob was kabadoning fucking Squidward?
Oh, my god.
Wait, you remember?
There was that one scene where it's like,
SpongeBob says bye Squidward twice,
and he's like, yeah, I like Squidward.
He's like, I like Squidward.
Like, I like Squidward, I'm telling you,
they didn't even mention Squidward, so.
They teased it.
I loved it.
I don't know, I had, like, I don't know,
I was like, I was just a crack ship.
Yeah, I was like, yeah, I was just a crack ship.
Yeah, Gojo and Cinderella is the one that's like a thing.
Yeah, that's a thing.
How the fuck is that?
I don't know why.
I don't know, what?
Wait, no.
What's the bikini bottom horror?
Someone said blame Sheebie.
What's the bikini?
Oh, Sheebie, sheebie deal.
I don't know what they mean by that.
Oh, oh, it's not your fault, it's just your fault.
It's just my fault.
No, wait, I got it wrong.
It's Sakuna and Cinderella, and then it's Gojo and Elsa.
Elsa, I was gonna say it's 100% Elsa
because they like math.
It's Elsa, yeah, but Sakuna and Cinderella, I don't know.
Gojo and Cinderella.
Although, I do like those random edits
where they'll splice a bunch of Disney cartoons together
and TikTok.
Do you know, like, Vima, Bad Boy, Vima, Vima, Vima, Vima.
Yeah, baby, get it.
I think there's some shrek in someone from El Dorado
or something, I don't even fucking know.
Wait, what's El Dorado?
It's an old, lesser known Disney movie, animated movie.
You would probably like it, The Road to El Dorado.
Yeah, I know it.
Because you're Spanish.
OK, thanks.
Ash, Ash, catch them in Sky from Paw Patrol.
Oh, it's DreamWorks.
This Sky of Dog?
Sky's a dog.
What?
You don't know El Dorado?
Sorry, DreamWorks.
Next could be something you should compare and deal.
I did ship Gojo and Dio when I watched it,
but I thought it was a great ship.
How could you not?
Yeah, I did, too.
I always love enemies to lovers.
In real life, though, that'd be fucking insufferable,
but enemies to lovers, right?
Yeah.
Or rivals to lovers.
I like that.
Like, that's a more realistic trope, in my opinion.
Sky is a dog.
What do you mean it would make more sun?
Shut up.
Wait, what?
I missed that part of it.
She looked up Ash, catch them in Sky from Paw Patrol.
Ash, catch them in Sky.
Nothing came up.
I think that's just their personal ship.
What?
That's just their personal.
That's just their own thing.
That's it.
Yeah, that's their own.
What the fuck?
You freak.
Is this a pinkish dog?
Or like, has paint on it?
Yeah, that's a girl dog, I think.
Oh, my god.
The only girl dog on the team.
Stuart Little in Wreck-It-Row.
Oh, my god.
I had a huge crush on Stuart Little.
I had a really big crush on Stuart Little.
No, I made Stuart Little.
I ate him, I ate him, I ate him.
I think it says, like, in my brain, in my brain,
I was like, nerdy white guy, you know,
brown women attracted to a white man.
That's cool, lead balls.
No, I ain't doing it, I don't hate him.
I have to look up these movies in Spanish,
because I don't know what that, I treasure planet.
What is that?
I hate Stuart Little for trying to put a deep, rooted
personal reason.
Why?
I know.
I also, I could tell you guys.
I don't like Stuart Little because I remember watching
Mouse Hunt, and I hated the Mouse and Mouse Hunt.
And then, Stuart Little was also a Mouse, so.
That's fair.
See, somebody, I watched in Spanish.
When I see the English child, I have to Google them,
because I don't know what that means.
Why they do that?
Wait, what about Reckon Ralph's ex-fixit Felix?
I shit that.
Well, that's just, yeah, that's just, like, you know, again.
Like, I had a rival.
I like the, yeah, rivals under me.
It was funny, though, because he was, like, Ralph.
They weren't even mean to each other.
They were just, like, hey, Ralph, you just can't hang out here.
You break everything.
Wait, Reckon Ralph ex-merida from Brave is, like, a real chip.
It's a real chip.
If you had the chance to change your fate, would ya?
Oh, yes, I fucking love Treasure Planets.
OK, why did you give the cat lady to the fat ass?
Is this, like, an actual thing?
She doesn't have a fat ass in the movie,
but that's pretty cool.
Yeah, I like that image.
I like how she's turning around.
OK, I'm like, like, they just made her ass so big.
Like, why?
Like, in the group chat, I looked up Treasure Planets.
I was looking for things I saw.
Why is her butt cheeks so big?
I own Treasure Planet on DVD.
I'm pretty proud of that.
Oh, my gosh.
That's a pretty good reaction.
Reckon's rerun?
That's a thing.
Is there art of that?
I was looking it up.
How about Freerun?
No, if I did Freerun X, it's just going to be Himmel.
I own it on VHS.
I don't think it ever was on VHS.
Oh, it's a, oh, yeah.
I remember that little meme, the little meme.
I don't understand what's happening now in English.
My brain's trying to understand this fucking English language.
Oh, my god.
Look at this.
Everyone, look it.
Shrek X Freerun.
They're crazy.
That's a thing?
Wait, can you post?
Yeah, you know, there's, like, yeah.
Oh, yeah, I can post it.
It's all you have on your stream.
I just logged it.
There's this art.
Wait, no, no, no.
Ignore that photo.
Ignore that.
Ignore that.
Ignore that.
Ignore that.
Ignore that.
Ignore that.
They just sent a white one in a very blue.
Mine's the color of a bubble.
It's really blue.
Ignore it.
Ignore that.
Okay, look at this.
Oh, that's actually pretty good art.
Is he picking her up?
I don't like that.
Her Shrek is super short.
Do you think she would like Shrek?
I think she would love Shrek.
I think she'd be.
Yeah, honestly, I think she would actually have a thing for him.
Oh, my gosh.
You should get art of you and Shrek, CB.
How about no?
All right, so I'm going to draw art of you and Shrek together.
Wait, do you guys have, like, a fictional character, like, like, crush that you, like,
push to be, like, silly and wacky?
Akira from Persona 5.
I actually don't.
I don't, I don't know.
Do you guys want to shit me with somebody?
Asking my, asking my hair.
Let me think.
What?
Oh, I know who I would shit you with.
I would shit, okay.
Wait, do you like, what kind of man do you like?
Do I continue?
Donkey, Donkey from Shrek.
Donkey?
You want to shit me with Donkey?
I can see you.
I don't like that at all.
You don't have the dragon that he, like, marries?
Oh, it's true.
I'm the dragon from Shrek.
I do like you guys.
I like guys who are funny.
That is true.
The main character from Golden Boy would love she be so much said in my chat.
Who, from Golden Boy?
Oh, yeah.
What is that?
It's a little old.
It's an anime, but some wacky.
It's wacky.
Okay, I'll have to look that up.

He's going to, we're going to, he likes blonde hair.
She's the other one.
I'm going to dye my hair blonde and he's going to fall in love with me.

I'm really into him.
I think Robert Pattison was sexy in that one.
Chibi X-Bugs Bunny.
No, that's, that's bad.
He's possibly my father.

Homelander?
First season homelander.
I don't, not, not later seasons.
Well, I'm a homelander.
Oh no, Chibi, not homelander.

Like, I'm like, oh, I let me mother you.
Like, I just want to take care of you.
Like, I like, I like to fix people.
I'm a fixer.
I have to stop watching it.
Cause I think once I saw the deep ass cheeks, I like tabbed out my brain.

Tell me more.
So the boys has a lot of nudity and there was one time he like makes a person blow him
and then my, my, my mommy, my mommy walked into my room and then she walks in, his butt
she's on my screen and I just felt ashamed.
Yes, I would be Omniman's little pet.
Yeah, I bet you were, you freak.
I'll have another rare crush, but it's like from a really specific movie.
And it's like the way that what happens to the character is very bad.
The fucked up characters.

Mmm.
Mmm.
I don't know what that means.
Oh, Chi X Hiccup.
That's pretty good.
Oh my.
I think Hiccup is so cute.
I didn't give it a go.
Hiccup is so cute.
I love how to train your dragon.
Yeah.
That's so like specific.
I feel like guys are fucked up teeth are so cute to me.
I don't know what that's.
I think that's exactly my type.
Like tall.
Why not?
To be a big ears and messy hair.
I like mentally ill or deep and brooding.
And that's why I had a huge crush on Robin.
Yeah.
I like either really like fucked up mentally ill guys are like guys that literally look
like they're like crack head teeth.
Yeah.
I don't know.
It just gets me going.
You guys.
Who's your ideal man?
Chi.
Which is your favorite trope that you're attracted to?
Um, charismatic and like, um, really fast.
Okay.
Okay.
Let me think.
I don't even know you guys.
It's okay.
You can just keep saying Sonic.
It's okay.
But I will be on my stand completely.
100%.
Nori X fish legs.
No, it's just.
I do like British accents.
Not Batman.
I like Robert Pattinson's Batman.
He was good.
I think, I think realistically.
I don't know.
Really.
Actually, I lied about why it could be any skin color.
Yeah.
Fucked up teeth and big ears.
I'm kind of into it.
But then my first question is super deep.
I don't know.
My first cartoon crush was the cat baron from the cat returns.
And then I fell in love with howl from howl's we've been castles.
So I don't know what that means about me.
What does that even mean about you?
I don't know.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Let me look it up.
Cat Baron.
Can you spell that for me?
I'm so sorry.
Cartman?
Okay.

I just, I don't understand.
Oh.
Oh, what the fuck?
Wait, I kind of to add that.
Yeah.
Right?
He's just like a gthon男.
No.
No.
Yeah.
I don't understand.
And then...
of liking. Do you guys ever watch? I really liked the Bolton, what the fuck is
his name? Bolton character from Game of Thrones that just fucking tortured people.
I thought he was Hoss. Fuck. I liked Joffrey. You liked Joffrey? Yeah. Okay.
I don't know what's happening. Yes, I like Ramsay, but I also liked him in Skins too,
so that's. Did you guys ever watch Little Bear? Little Bear? A movie with the two
bear brothers where they turn into bears. That's a brother bear. Oh, that's a brother bear?
Oh, I'm fucking restarted. I definitely had a crush on the bear, the older brother.
Oh, no, Chai wasn't a lie for this. What do you mean, shame? Don't shame me. Listen,
I think my first was like a little kid. It was Jake from Jake and the Neverland Pirates.
That's a child shell. Oh, that's cute. And I was my first crush. And then my most recent
crush is Chuchuch Tim's. I think my first human crush was Peter from Peter Pan, but like when
he was from Family Guy. No, the live action Peter Pan. Yes, with the kid with the freckles.
Yeah, he was cute. I don't know. I feel like I didn't have any like fictional crushes.
Except for Sonic. Oh, yeah, maybe I'm just very much. Oh, Jeremy Sumpter. Oh, yeah.
Wait, what's that word? Misogynist. I liked. Do you guys know Papyrus from Undertale?
Oh, I should Papyrus extends. I don't know what the fuck is wrong. Why am I saying this? No,
no, no, I agree. I had a big I had a crush on Papyrus. You had a crush on Papyrus?
Papyrus. Turning into Sean Connery. Honestly, I see it. I understand. I like I like a guy
who likes puzzles and tries to keep me entertained. I like the guy from the cow from Barnyard.
Otis. Yeah, Otis. I know my jaw drop actually my jaw drop. Our trans icon because he's a male cow
with otters. Oh, yeah, what is she? That's the joke. People just kept running with it.
I'm trying to think. Or is my like non human crush. I'm trying to think. Non human. You
guys watch Dragon Tales? Dragon Tales, Dragon Tales. Yes. The twin. I like the twins. Yeah,
the twin green. I guess I like twins. Maybe it's my Gemini moon. What the fuck? Non human.
Non human characters that are hot. I'm still trying to think. I don't know. I had too much of a
grind set. I didn't have time for crushes. Okay, I can think. I remember now. Bumblebee from
Transformers. Bumblebee from Transformers. And then when he spoke, when he spoke, I was really
into it. And then I really had a huge crush on Godzilla. I thought Godzilla was so cool. Spirit
the horse. Yes. Oh, yes. Yeah. Spirit that was Spanish. It was so sexy. I will lie. Yeah,
that's that's literally the whole movie. That's a seductive horse. And Balto from Balto. I don't
know man. You guys are weird. You didn't think this horse from Spirit is hot. Yeah. I don't
even know what that is. You never watched Spirit recently. I think it was a horse girl. Neither
was I, but I watched. Wait, show me. Show me him. Okay, that's him. Oh, there you go.
Long hair. Yes. Yes. Men with long hair. I think I just like incels. I'm thinking about it more.
I like I like incels and my old fat men. Yeah, I got a wide range. Yeah, I like a pretty wide
range. But if you're like a person, I don't know what my type is. Maybe guys like Sonic. I just
watched you put spirit. Watch them appear on the screen. You just corrupt the child image. One
gift was all it took. Spirit is a very charismatic horse. Yeah. And then we were like a horse. I
felt like I was being flirted with. No, it wasn't the size difference or the power. I think it was
Godzilla's like swag. I was like, holy shit. All of them. I have a problem. Oh, wait, no. And
my action I lied. My first human crush was one of the monsters in Power Rangers in Power Rangers
Samurai. I remember which one I just know is Power Rangers Samurai. I fucking I would do it with
show about Power Rangers. Every time I feel like I'm on screen, I was like, oh, yeah, this is
hot. I used to have a really big crush on Zuko too. I think everyone does. That's just basic. That's
basic. Yeah, it's pretty basic. That's my basic one. What about Uncle Irel? Am I right? I agree. No,
honestly would. No, I'm kidding. This is a safe space. Try. No judgment here. Try. Oh, yeah,
right. I don't even think she be kind to you. Um, not in the place. Oh, the cucumber from
Veggie Tales. No. Veggie Tales. I was forced to watch Veggie Tales. I didn't like Veggie
Tales. I have to watch it. I could watch it to learn English. That's a great show to watch to
learn English.
I don't know.
Iro in his prime. Buff Iro in jail. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah. Guilf, Guilf. 100%.
You guys are just listing off basically every character now. Not all. Not all. Not all.
Do you guys remember that movie Meet the Robinsons? Yes. Oh, the like black hair. Black hair? Yeah.
Okay, yeah, that's actually kind of real. I had a crush on Goob, the evil guy. I had a crush on
the evil guy. Oh, I had a crush on, um, what's his face? The enemy and the Incredibles?
And what was his name? Central? Yeah. Yeah. I had a crush on Goob, the white hair lady. You
remind me of the white hair lady. I remind you of the white haired lady? Yeah, I think she's really
pretty. Oh, you are like her. You are like her. Um, Goob when he was older, so like when he was
like all hunchbacked and like dirty looking and yeah. I like the one slur, but I think that was
pretty basic. No, no, that's a pretty, that's a pretty. I totally get it though. Like it makes
sense. Yeah. Mirage. Yeah, he's reminded Mirage. I don't know. I think it's the lowering appeal
with her. I don't know. I think, I think if I'm like trying to like,
hmm, it'd be like, oh, I'm, I'm kind of bad, but I'm, I'm like protective.
Like I'm like, I'm strong and I'm powerful. Yeah, maybe bad boy. Maybe like Draco mouth.
But it's like, but it's like, oh, but, but like for the one I love, I'm like soft and
protective and sweet. You know? Oh, so like Edward from Twilight. Oh, but no, not really. I
don't feel anything. I feel nothing. Quasimodo. Nori, people want to know if you like Quasimodo.
Quasimodo. From hunchback of Notre Dame. Um, I like the old man. Sorry. You like the old man?
I was, I liked the gypsy girl. I can't remember her name. Was it Esmeralda?
Okay. Cause I, okay. I wasn't in Spanish, right? Okay. I wasn't in Spanish, right? So in Spanish,
I have seen the Spanish version. I would get so. The voice actor was crazy for Spanish.
He just sounded so good. So I kind of just like fumbled everything. And I'm also like,
I'm kind of religious. So religious man, evil religious man. I was like, oh, this is amazing.
The creepy priest. Younger, little meaner than what I wanted. And I wanted the creepy old looking
man. Guys, I don't know who's that. I'm looking them up. Um, I can steal a Frollo from hunchback
of Notre Dame. Frollo, hunchback. Sakuna, like, well, that's like basic. Yeah, like, yeah, he's hot.
But like, we're trying to get to the fucked up ones, you know?
Oh, um, Pennywise. Pennywise? Pennywise? What was, what was the thingy from
I like the actor. The Demi Gorgon, but I never watched anything. So it was just the Demi Gorgon.
I've seen a bad dragon dildo of the Demi Gorgon. What? I don't even want to know what that is.
I don't want to know. I don't know what that is. I don't know what that is. You're not gonna
explain. Wait, can you link it? Link, it's a tie. Okay, I got you. Hold on. Not to me.
Oh my god. I feel like such a lame-o. Oh my god. Come on. Come on. You're even sexy even. Stranger
wrongs. No, don't curl chai. I just want to watch it. Don't curl chai. I want it.
I don't think this is gonna make any sense, but I did have, I do can recall that I had a big crush
on this cat. This cat? Get that out of my DMs right now. Get that out of my DMs right now.
Get that out of my DMs right now. I deleted it. You sick one. What did I tell you? I told
you no. I don't want to see it. What cat? Let's just change the subject. Now what kind of
you sick bastard? No, she's my friend. She's my friend. She's my friend. She's my friend.
Why is she your friend? Why is she your friend? Is that the cat from Franklin? No, this is a cat from
Little Bear. Oh, oh. That's not Little Bear. Chai. Chai. Why is it cat?
It was more, I think that's a thing. I think it's personality. I think I don't have a physical
type. I think that's the problem. They could be a cat. They could be a cow. They could be a cucumber.
Do you know the dog from Lady and the Tramp?
Uh, yeah. I had a question. The dog, like the lady's love interest, I don't know.
He went to do everything to be with her, man. I kind of liked it. Wait, what dog? Oh,
Bolts? The dog from Lady and the Tramp. Oh, I thought, sorry, I thought you meant Bolts.
Oh, but yes. Uh, Tramp, yeah. I thought he was very attractive. And he loved Lady very much,
yes. Oh, yeah. Very cute. There's the pure love that I like. Yeah, they were, like,
different classes. It was very adorable. Now I'm a sucker for the Juliet, Romeo and Juliet type
of trope. Someone's a sucker for that. I love there so much. Someone said bubble baths from Spongebob.
No. No, no, no, no. Okay. Who do you like from Spongebob?
I like the guy in the Spongebob movie that was like the bounty hunter that was hunting them down
with the really nice boots. Oh, yeah. I forgot about him.
Dennis, yeah. I didn't have a crush on the Spongebob characters. I was ship in Spongebob.
We were just ship in them. Maybe the robot lady, the wife. Oh, Karen?
Karen, yeah. I like the wife. David Hasselhoff. I don't know. David Hasselhoff.
There hasn't been like, oh, what anime characters do you guys resonate with? Like, what kind of,
like, oh, this is so- Do I kid? Yeah, like, who do you kid? Who do you guys see? Who do you guys
kid? Who's your kid? Who's your kid? Who's your kid? I haven't kidned a anime character in a very long
time. And I usually watch my first kid. I think my, my head always goes to tiger,
icica, icica, icica, icica, icica. Icicle, yeah. Icicle, tiger. Like, that's like always,
I can't, it's like uncontrollable, but I think like Toru, Toru Honda.
I'd have to think about mine. Yeah, I have to think. I couldn't really like kid myself,
because I have to, I feel like I have to relate to a character, and I don't really feel like I
really relate it, especially with the anime I watched. I usually used anime as a form of
escapism. I didn't want anything to remind me of my life. Oh, that, yeah. I usually watch like
super, I never watched like slice of life stuff. I watched like super high fantasy stuff, or like
sci-fi, or just like fucking, I was just watching Naruto and Full Metal Alchemist and all the time,
and I like, yeah, I can't. Oh, I liked Alphonse from Full Metal Alchemist. Is that your kid?
Suit of armor. No, he's not my kin, but like, I liked him. Oh, you liked him? Oh, okay.
Suki from Avatar, who I want to be. Oh yeah, I feel that. I don't know. I don't know who I can,
I'm not gonna say it all out though. I thought you guys would answer too. Is it like a weird? I don't
know if I have any like weird ones. I think most of them are like pretty, pretty, like sound like
pretty like normal. Um, I'm gonna keep her to myself. She's your, your anime Oshii. Um, let me see.
Oh my god. What is it, kin? It's just like a, it's a nerd term to me. I can't do like super
really, too. You're like, oh, this is me and I am them. They are me. We are one. We are Venom.
Of course, I'm Venom. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. What's the tongue do? No, no, not the tongue. It wasn't
the tongue. It was just the fact that he was like a symbiote. Yeah. And I was like, what would he
feel like if he was inside of me, but not like in a weird way and like, in like a, like in a symbiote
suit kind of way. Okay. I think, I think I actually might have kin death the kid.
Yes, yes, yes. Wait, me too, me too, me too. Because I have OCD and so I like really related
with this character because for obsession with symmetry and stuff. Yeah. Oh, I fucking love
Solator. Solator was my shit. I had so many OCs. I was very much obsessed with that the kid. I think
I related to him a lot. Yeah, I want to say that. It's like, I can always, I was like,
I feel like it's like, I like a character so much I want to be them or like, I'm like, that's so me.
Yeah. So me for real, for real. That's so me. That's me for real. Let's be for real. Let's be for
real. I can the dune worm. What the fuck are you doing? What's dune? You don't know what dune is?
No. It's a book. It's a sci-fi book. I don't know if you, I don't think you would like it at all
actually or even the movie. I don't only think it's your thing. Nope. Yeah. I like that. Also,
I don't even know how to read properly. I think I'm like genuinely dyslexic. So that's okay. Oh,
I know what my, my first, my first kid where I was like, really obsessed with the character and I
was like, Oh my God, I want that to be me so bad. I wanted it to be me. It was Asuna from Sword Art
on the line. Oh, I feel it. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mine's with, mine's with Sasuke. Oh, really? Okay.
Yeah, that's good. Mine's with Sasuke. I'm on the line. What was an anime you wish you were in the
world in? Like, like, sword art, sword art. Yeah. Mine was, I don't really think it was an anime,
but I really wish I was in Code Lyoko. Wait, what's that? You don't know what Code Lyoko is? Am I,
I don't know. So Code Lyoko is this show where these kids go to like school,
but then there's this like this master computer that like tries to fucking kill them every day.
Why are there four heads so big? Yeah, they fucking use four heads. But they go into the computer to
fight, like it's like reset time. And so they just reset time all the time. I just fucking love Code
Lyoko. That was my shit. Wait, someone says I don't blame TV. I can understand that. I wanted to,
I, odd, odd was my, oh, I fucking was in love with odd, which was like the cat, the cat boy.
Oh, wait, I want to look it up now. How do you spell it? It was a really weird
art style, but yeah, Code Lyoko Ly, okay. Code Lyoko is French. Yes, it's originally French.
It's so interesting. But I love Bible Villaco. The thing that I wanted to be in, I'm trying to think.
I wanted to be in Code Lyoko and you know Naruto naturally. Either Yvonne Gellor the persona series,
yeah, yeah. I know I would die though, but um, oh yeah, I don't know, man.
Corks party, I'm lying, maybe Corks party, you wanna be a Corks party?
No, you could not, you would die so fast.
That's terrible.
Why?
Because Kauru isn't Eva, and I was obsessed with him.
But now, I'm gonna have a Corks party, I'm built different, I'm gonna fucking, I'm gonna walk out of there alive, not a scratch on my body.
I'm already very mentally disturbed.
Have you done a playthrough of Corks party on your channel?
Not on my channel, I've played it before though.
Oh, okay, cause I'm like, let me know when you do, cause I wanna watch it then.
Yeah, yeah, if I do I'll let you know, but if I was physically there, that little girl, that little girl was getting punted.
Oh my god.
Oh man, that'd be fun, aren't there making a two or something I've seen?
Yeah, they're redoing it, they're making a new game.
It's the buttered pooper, I totally forgot, cause I made the buttered pooper references before and I forgot it was from Corks party, such a great fucking game.
And Madfather, I loved all those RPG maker games.
What is your favorite visual novel, Nori?
Sorry.
Mmm.
What?
They said nori, they said Nori.
Oh, don't look it up, maggot beach.
What?
Don't look it up, don't do it, there's no better chair.
I think I've heard of that.
How do I spell it? Or send it?
I don't care.
I want to
You might not like it, but I won't like it
A clapjack just said, oh, mega beat
I've heard of that, what is that?
But if you want like a normie, a normie taste
Um, Totono?
Is it my one of my favorite ones?
I think it's very beautifully done
So I really like this one
Oh, I'm Sayushi! I'm Sayushi!
Sayushi's also really good
I'm going to mess up now
Wait, hold on, raid, raid, moment, raid, moment
Another one?

She's popular, she's cool
I put maggot balls on accident
It's maggot beads
So it's maggot beads, Totono
Oh

The girl's eye is being popped out of its socket
Yep
There's titties in this screen
Yep
Yep
What is this, it's like
Oh, why? I like it so much
I think it's just maybe like the art
And stuff is like really like
Interesting
I don't know, I'm like, I'm a huge sucker for like
Very unique art styles, yeah
Yeah, I'm not averse to like gore
And just like dark themes
So I'm actually like, I'm not
I'm not really a visual novel person
Really
You could just watch a play through of it
Yeah, maybe I might do that
I usually will just read manga
But I haven't even read manga in a long time
Yeah, consuming Japanese media
Has mostly been for me, just like anime
But I usually watch normie animes, so
I would recommend visual novels if you want like a little base tea
Some of them are pretty simple
You're just literally just reading and like
Picking an option
Yeah, it's like just
And you can also Google options
If you just want to like, if you just want to like
Have a specific ending done
Things like that
I think too hard
What is it?
Anyone here watched Food Wars?
Why did you say it like that?
Never heard of it
I don't know what you're talking about
What's Food Wars?
Yeah, never, yeah, exactly
Yeah, I actually don't know what that is
I'm so hurry
Hi son
I just told you I like the maggot baits
Why the fuck would I look at something that's called
Food Wars?
Do you think I'm a normal person now buddy?
I'm like an edged lord
Call me Sasuke Uchiha
Noriko Uchiha
Noriko Uchiha
Honestly, kind of a badass name
Yeah, it's my new name now
I know man, can you re-brand to that?
Visual novels often have late scenes though
Yeah, but if you get them through Steam
You're like centered so hard
So it doesn't even matter
I've heard that
Yeah, the stuff is centered
Yeah, but visual novels
I think are very worth to even just look at
So if you ever want a visual novel recommendation
I will
I can look and I'll send you some
Thank you

It was lovely
What did you think of the girlies?
Aren't they amazing?

Blinked slower than the other
That was really weird
But yeah
I'll probably collab with those girls again
