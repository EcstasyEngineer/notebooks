01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
You

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
You

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
You

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
You

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
You

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
You

04:00.000 --> 04:16.000
I'm talking now my voice is too low. If I could really close, yes.

04:16.000 --> 04:28.000
I've worked on this for several hours and if it's still not working, then I'm gonna cry.

04:46.000 --> 05:04.000
It's not working. I'm using you.

05:04.000 --> 05:10.000
I'm really gonna cry.

05:10.000 --> 05:24.000
It's still too quiet.

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
I don't know.

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
Does that work?

05:32.000 --> 05:38.000
Hello?

05:38.000 --> 05:48.000
Oh, my cheek is still white.

05:48.000 --> 05:58.000
Can you hear me?

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
Okay, I'm really sad.

06:02.000 --> 06:10.000
Nothing's working today and I'm kind of upset.

06:10.000 --> 06:22.000
The one thing that was bothering me is that I couldn't change one of my eyelashes to the right color because the mesh is just not working.

06:22.000 --> 06:32.000
I apologize if you can hear my AC.

06:32.000 --> 06:42.000
I'll put on some rain.

06:42.000 --> 06:54.000
I hope the rain helps.

06:54.000 --> 07:10.000
I didn't want to cancel though because I wanted to spend time with you today.

07:10.000 --> 07:28.000
I have allergies. That's why I'm sniffling by the way.

07:28.000 --> 07:44.000
My head would stay connected to my body.

07:44.000 --> 07:56.000
Do you think I look cute?

07:56.000 --> 08:06.000
Do I look nice?

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
I also think there's a delay.

08:10.000 --> 08:26.000
Again, I don't know why.

08:26.000 --> 08:32.000
She needs reassurance. She's been stressed out today.

08:32.000 --> 08:40.000
I'm working with stuff and I'm tired of technology.

08:40.000 --> 08:54.000
I'm moving the model with my mouth so I'm not all the way over here.

08:54.000 --> 09:06.000
Hi, my name is Sheeby Cottonbomb and today we're going to be doing an ASMR.

09:06.000 --> 09:12.000
It's going to be Improv ASMR.

09:12.000 --> 09:24.000
I'm kind of mad that my stream is not doing the right latency because Improv is needed and chat interaction is needed.

09:24.000 --> 09:36.000
Sorry if I sniffle in your ear.

09:36.000 --> 09:52.000
I should change the title to You Give Yaro Sheeby Therapy because she's stressed out.

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
What do you mean I'm just ahead?

09:56.000 --> 10:02.000
I don't know what you're talking about.

10:02.000 --> 10:08.000
My allergies are kidding me this morning.

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
I don't feel good.

10:12.000 --> 10:20.000
I'm having a pain flare up so I don't really feel good right now either.

10:20.000 --> 10:26.000
I won't get my white cheek.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Let me fix that.

10:28.000 --> 10:34.000
This might be very scuffed ASMR. I apologize.

10:34.000 --> 10:42.000
I'm still pissed. I can't color my one eyelash.

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
Did I?

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
I should have posted on the wrong account.

10:50.000 --> 10:56.000
Oh my god, I'm going to lose a guy this way.

11:16.000 --> 11:20.000
I'm sorry.

11:20.000 --> 11:26.000
I'm sorry.

11:26.000 --> 11:32.000
I'm sorry.

11:32.000 --> 11:38.000
I'm sorry.

11:38.000 --> 11:52.000
I'm sorry.

11:52.000 --> 12:02.000
Yeah, it's one of those things.

12:02.000 --> 12:08.000
I'll probably just cut all of this out of the vod.

12:08.000 --> 12:26.000
What was I going to do? I was going to color my cheek.

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
I can't do that right now. It doesn't matter.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
No, it doesn't matter to me.

12:32.000 --> 12:38.000
I'm very...

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
Don't worry about how my head is disconnected.

12:42.000 --> 12:48.000
I'm very...

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
I don't really know how to explain that I'm not myself today.

12:52.000 --> 13:00.000
But I'm not myself today, as you can see.

13:00.000 --> 13:08.000
I'm almost wishing I could be babyed right now.

13:08.000 --> 13:18.000
Hold on.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Now you throw my head in the trash.

13:20.000 --> 13:26.000
Anyways, how's it going?

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
One moment.

13:30.000 --> 13:46.000
I will remind you that my Bunspeak accent comes out when I'm...

13:46.000 --> 13:52.000
feeling some types of way.

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
But don't worry.

13:56.000 --> 14:00.000
It'll change.

14:00.000 --> 14:04.000
Is there a voice in the background?

14:04.000 --> 14:08.000
It's my desktop audio.

14:08.000 --> 14:14.000
Do you like my bedroom? I took it from Canvo.

14:14.000 --> 14:36.000
No.

14:36.000 --> 14:42.000
Nobody can see that, right?

14:42.000 --> 14:50.000
Maybe I should not do this on stream.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Don't look.

14:52.000 --> 15:14.000
Don't look.

15:14.000 --> 15:34.000
Don't worry about it.

15:34.000 --> 15:38.000
That's close enough.

15:38.000 --> 15:48.000
Ahem.

15:48.000 --> 15:52.000
I love that.

15:52.000 --> 16:02.000
I look very cute. I can't wait to get hands.

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
I'm stressing.

16:06.000 --> 16:12.000
Okay, yeah.

16:12.000 --> 16:16.000
Yaru Dolhan gets babyed by chat, maybe.

16:16.000 --> 16:22.000
Okay, um, how long?

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
Okay, I've been streaming for 16 minutes.

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
I won't cut 16 minutes.

16:30.000 --> 16:34.000
So the roleplay today is going to be improved.

16:34.000 --> 16:42.000
It's going to be more scuffed than you think it is, because I'm kind of doing stuff off the rip.

16:42.000 --> 16:52.000
I'm going to do all the doughnose and stuff at the end and all that.

16:52.000 --> 17:00.000
Yeah.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
What if I told you, like, you want this color?

17:02.000 --> 17:08.000
Not good, because I'm going to be this color eventually.

17:08.000 --> 17:16.000
Um, so this is going to require some chat interaction.

17:16.000 --> 17:20.000
Are you ready to rumble?

17:20.000 --> 17:26.000
I have some stuff.

17:26.000 --> 17:36.000
I'm used to this scuff, madam. It's fine.

17:36.000 --> 17:50.000
Why am I holding your hair?

17:50.000 --> 18:00.000
Hmm.

18:00.000 --> 18:06.000
What was that about?

18:06.000 --> 18:12.000
You're sleepy already?

18:12.000 --> 18:18.000
The scene is, you're my classmate.

18:18.000 --> 18:36.000
Why did you over my house?

18:36.000 --> 18:44.000
Why did you over my house?

18:44.000 --> 18:50.000
Because we can work on a project together.

18:50.000 --> 18:56.000
My body's going to be jumping back and forth.

18:56.000 --> 19:02.000
It's a rainy day.

19:02.000 --> 19:08.000
And you don't have any power at your house.

19:08.000 --> 19:12.000
So we're doing that at mine. I hope you don't mind.

19:12.000 --> 19:16.000
Is that okay with you?

19:16.000 --> 19:22.000
It better be okay with you. You don't really have a choice in this.

19:22.000 --> 19:30.000
This is my bedroom.

19:30.000 --> 19:34.000
I'm going to...

19:34.000 --> 19:54.000
I'm going to put my body on the bed and you can stare at her from over there.

19:54.000 --> 20:04.000
This is mine.

20:04.000 --> 20:14.000
Pink is my favorite color.

20:14.000 --> 20:40.000
I'm going to start now.

20:40.000 --> 20:48.000
Hey, yeah. You can put yourself anywhere. Make yourself at home.

20:48.000 --> 20:56.000
I guess we better get ready and get started on that project.

20:56.000 --> 21:02.000
Did you remember to bring the assignment?

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
No.

21:04.000 --> 21:08.000
Do you even remember what the assignment is?

21:08.000 --> 21:12.000
You don't?

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
I knew I shouldn't have partnered with you.

21:14.000 --> 21:18.000
I was hoping that you'd do all the work because I thought you were one of the smarter kids.

21:18.000 --> 21:22.000
I guess I was wrong. I guess you're just still dumb.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
What's that on my bed?

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Oh, it's just my body.

21:26.000 --> 21:30.000
Don't worry about that.

21:30.000 --> 21:36.000
Sorry if my AC's loud. It has been a pretty hot one out there.

21:36.000 --> 21:42.000
Please don't stare at her though. That's kind of rude. Please don't stare at my body.

21:42.000 --> 21:48.000
She's, you know, just trying to hang out.

21:48.000 --> 21:52.000
You fell asleep in class when the teacher was telling us?

21:52.000 --> 22:00.000
I would never have ever thought that from you. Have you been getting sleep?

22:00.000 --> 22:08.000
Alright. Maybe you should work on getting better sleep.

22:08.000 --> 22:16.000
Well, so, we have a history project.

22:16.000 --> 22:32.000
It has to do with 18th century literature and its impact on history.

22:32.000 --> 22:42.000
I think. Hold on. Let me go on my phone real quick. I'll tell you what the teacher emailed me.

22:42.000 --> 22:48.000
Hold on.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
No.

22:50.000 --> 23:00.000
Oh my god, where's this freaking email?

23:00.000 --> 23:08.000
My phone turned into a book.

23:08.000 --> 23:22.000
Oh, it's the history of magic. That's what it is. That's why I managed to turn my phone into a book.

23:22.000 --> 23:30.000
My body's holding the phone. I have two phones.

23:30.000 --> 23:38.000
You only know about 17th century literature? You're going to be absolutely useless.

23:38.000 --> 23:48.000
Can we look at the history of anthropomorphic girls? I think that's a little bit off topic.

23:48.000 --> 23:56.000
Anyways, you can come and sit with me on the bed and we can start.

23:56.000 --> 24:02.000
Did you bring your notebook with you for class?

24:02.000 --> 24:08.000
You did? Okay. Cool.

24:08.000 --> 24:12.000
Hold on. Let me just tuck my head on my body.

24:12.000 --> 24:18.000
Give me a moment.

24:18.000 --> 24:26.000
Hold on. My head's still a little bit too big.

24:26.000 --> 24:40.000
Him.

24:40.000 --> 24:46.000
Why don't you come sit?

24:46.000 --> 24:55.000
Just make yourself comfortable. Just come sit down.

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
Is there a problem?

24:58.000 --> 25:02.000
Yeah, you can sit on my butt. Where else are you going to sit? That chair?

25:02.000 --> 25:10.000
I guess you could sit there too if you wanted to, but it will be easier if you sit nice and close to me.

25:10.000 --> 25:26.000
Let me grab my notebook.

25:26.000 --> 25:36.000
Okay, I got it.

25:36.000 --> 25:42.000
Alright, so do you mind if I copy some of your notes?

25:42.000 --> 25:48.000
Can you lay on my lap? Well, that's a little bit too close for comfort.

25:48.000 --> 25:56.000
Yeah, and you're either close to me so I can read your notes and copy some of them.

25:56.000 --> 26:00.000
Okay? Thank you.

26:00.000 --> 26:06.000
Alright, so you said that you would do this.

26:06.000 --> 26:10.000
You would do that.

26:10.000 --> 26:16.000
What does that say? What does that say? I can't really read your writing.

26:16.000 --> 26:20.000
What is it? I'll come back to that later, I guess.

26:20.000 --> 26:24.000
Okay.

26:24.000 --> 26:30.000
And then you're right there.

26:30.000 --> 26:36.000
Okay, what if I...

26:36.000 --> 26:46.000
I'm not coincidentally wrong.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
You put...

26:48.000 --> 26:54.000
You regard an eye.

26:54.000 --> 26:58.000
That's alright. My handwriting is best you do.

26:58.000 --> 27:04.000
I'm getting bored reading all your stupid words anyways.

27:04.000 --> 27:10.000
I thought you were supposed to be the smart one. I think my notes are better than yours.

27:10.000 --> 27:18.000
I don't know if I should even bother copying these.

27:18.000 --> 27:24.000
Yeah, you still spoke coincidentally incorrect.

27:24.000 --> 27:28.000
Can you spell supercalifragilisticexpialidocious?

27:28.000 --> 27:32.000
Thank you.

27:40.000 --> 27:44.000
X-P-M-Dosh.

27:44.000 --> 27:52.000
S-U-P-E-R-C-A-L-I-F-R-A-G.

27:52.000 --> 28:04.000
I-L-I-S-T-I-C-E-X-P-I-A-L-A-D-O-C-I-O-U-S.

28:04.000 --> 28:12.000
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.

28:12.000 --> 28:16.000
I'm sorry. That was correct.

28:16.000 --> 28:20.000
Oh, you can spell it, right? You still hope.

28:20.000 --> 28:26.000
Unless you're just typing what I just told you.

28:26.000 --> 28:30.000
Even the sound of it is something quite atrocious.

28:30.000 --> 28:34.000
Did you ever watch Mary Poppins?

28:34.000 --> 28:42.000
I don't know.

28:42.000 --> 28:46.000
Yeah, it's a real word.

28:46.000 --> 28:50.000
Look it up. Wake up supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.

28:50.000 --> 28:54.000
And then your mouth.

28:54.000 --> 28:58.000
I'm going to pop my head on then.

28:58.000 --> 29:02.000
I'm sorry.

29:02.000 --> 29:07.000
I'm sorry.

29:10.000 --> 29:14.000
I'm married Poppins, you know.

29:14.000 --> 29:18.000
I think that we're even getting a little louder.

29:18.000 --> 29:23.000
I hope you don't mind. You can still hear me, right?

29:28.000 --> 29:53.000
Do you have another page I can copy?

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
Cool.

29:56.000 --> 30:03.000
It's pretty humid outside.

30:03.000 --> 30:07.000
I think I need a sharpener in my pencil, but I don't have a pencil sharpener.

30:07.000 --> 30:11.000
Do you have a pencil I can borrow?

30:11.000 --> 30:18.000
Did I hear about the drama between Stacy and her mom?

30:18.000 --> 30:22.000
I heard that Stacy's mom has got it going on.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
That's all I've heard though.

30:24.000 --> 30:30.000
I don't know what you've heard.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Can we chew on your pencils?

30:32.000 --> 30:39.000
I love chewing on pencils.

30:39.000 --> 30:55.000
Pencil chewing.

30:55.000 --> 31:02.000
It's quite tasty to be honest.

31:02.000 --> 31:05.000
I don't like chewing on an eraser.

31:05.000 --> 31:12.000
Thank you for letting me borrow your pencil that you want.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Have you ever seen Stacy's mom?

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
I haven't seen her.

31:15.000 --> 31:21.000
Is she hot?

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
What does that word say?

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
I said what does that word say?

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
That one right there.

31:28.000 --> 31:32.000
Can you tell me what that word says?

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
It says what?

31:34.000 --> 31:41.000
You can't write that.

31:41.000 --> 31:44.000
Why would you write that?

31:44.000 --> 31:49.000
That wasn't part of the lesson.

31:49.000 --> 31:55.000
I gotta sneeze.

31:55.000 --> 32:00.000
Okay.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
I don't think you're listening to me.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
What does that say?

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
You don't know what it says?

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
Are you blind?

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
I think you're blind.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
What's up with that?

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
I don't know.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
It says something in the...

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
You're writing inappropriate things.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
Is this not...

32:17.000 --> 32:21.000
Are you writing inappropriate things?

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
I don't...

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
I'm just gonna skip that section

32:24.000 --> 32:27.000
because I don't know what you were writing.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
You're really weird.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
You're like really really weird.

32:31.000 --> 32:34.000
I wish we weren't lab partners.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
It says street class but we're lab partners.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Don't question it.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
We're partners in a lot of things.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
What's up with that?

32:41.000 --> 32:44.000
Why are you so...

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
You do need your glasses?

32:45.000 --> 32:51.000
Then grab your glasses.

32:51.000 --> 32:54.000
That says bloodonkers.

32:54.000 --> 32:58.000
Why would you write bloodonkers?

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
Why are you so naughty?

33:00.000 --> 33:09.000
That's really inappropriate.

33:09.000 --> 33:12.000
What does that say?

33:12.000 --> 33:13.000
Can you repeat...

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
Can you say this what you wrote out loud?

33:15.000 --> 33:24.000
Because I need to hear you say it.

33:24.000 --> 33:27.000
It's a history line, exactly.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
We're always partners.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
We're partners in biology.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
We're partners in anatomy.

33:33.000 --> 33:36.000
We're partners together in history class.

33:36.000 --> 33:40.000
I'm kind of sick of seeing you in my face.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
I didn't even want to light you over my house.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
My mom said I had to light you over my house.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
I didn't even want to light you over my house.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
Because you're one of the kids and you're small weird.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
You're one of the weird kids that sits alone.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
And don't you like a minet or something?

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
What is it called?

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
Like cartoons?

33:54.000 --> 34:01.000
Are you like a little too old for cartoons?

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
Peanuts?

34:02.000 --> 34:06.000
What is peanuts?

34:06.000 --> 34:12.000
I don't know what that means.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
I don't...

34:14.000 --> 34:22.000
What's going on here?

34:22.000 --> 34:26.000
What's up with that?

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
Anime?

34:28.000 --> 34:32.000
Whatever the fuck that is, I don't really care about it.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
Why do you like anime?

34:34.000 --> 34:35.000
Anime is weird.

34:35.000 --> 34:39.000
Anime is for weirdos.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
Your mom likes me though?

34:41.000 --> 34:46.000
No, she doesn't.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Wait, now I have to ask her.

34:48.000 --> 34:58.000
I'm weird sometimes.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
What's this anime called?

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
You have a manga?

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
A manga?

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
A manga?

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
A manga?

35:06.000 --> 35:09.000
What is...

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
You have a comic book in your backpack?

35:12.000 --> 35:16.000
What does it say?

35:16.000 --> 35:19.000
Is it in Japanese?

35:19.000 --> 35:22.000
I can't read Japanese.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.000
It's not in Japanese?

35:23.000 --> 35:26.000
Oh, the cover is in Japanese.

35:26.000 --> 35:31.000
Oh, I got those nipples.

35:31.000 --> 35:34.000
Why do you have to read this from right to left?

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
That's really confusing.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
A mango?

35:38.000 --> 35:44.000
I wish I had a mango.

35:44.000 --> 35:50.000
Your mom likes me, and if you keep being unpolite, I'm going to hit her.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
Don't hit on my mom.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
That's weird.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
You're weirdo.

35:55.000 --> 36:01.000
You like anime and you want to hit on people's moms?

36:01.000 --> 36:04.000
What's...

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
It's called a dojinshi?

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
What is that?

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Can I see it?

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
Give it to me.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.000
Over.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
Just let me see it.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
Why are you fighting me?

36:17.000 --> 36:23.000
Why would you bring it out of your backpack if you weren't going to show it to me?

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
Don't run away from me.

36:25.000 --> 36:28.000
Hand it over.

36:28.000 --> 36:32.000
Thank you very much.

36:32.000 --> 36:41.000
Let me look through it.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
I can't even see what this is saying.

36:43.000 --> 36:51.000
Oh, mom.

36:51.000 --> 36:56.000
Okay.

36:56.000 --> 37:02.000
What the heck is this?

37:02.000 --> 37:08.000
What are you reading?

37:08.000 --> 37:11.000
What?

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
Did you just call me a baka?

37:13.000 --> 37:16.000
What the heck is a baka?

37:16.000 --> 37:20.000
Why are you looking at this stuff at school?

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
Wait, where did you get it?

37:21.000 --> 37:24.000
How did you get this?

37:24.000 --> 37:29.000
Did they help us in the school library?

37:29.000 --> 37:35.000
Do you have more of this?

37:35.000 --> 37:38.000
Is this kind of hot?

37:38.000 --> 37:41.000
Is this kind of cool?

37:41.000 --> 37:45.000
I can't tell what's going on.

37:45.000 --> 37:49.000
Why can't I see through her?

37:49.000 --> 37:54.000
That's a lot of liquid.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
What is that?

37:56.000 --> 38:01.000
Is that supposed to be what I think it's supposed to be?

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
It's a gyaru dosi?

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
What's a gyaru?

38:06.000 --> 38:09.000
What's a gyaru?

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
Gyaru?

38:11.000 --> 38:14.000
I don't know what that is.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
My name is Shibi, right?

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Yeah?

38:18.000 --> 38:21.000
That's what my mom named me.

38:21.000 --> 38:26.000
After the Queen of Shiba, African Princess.

38:27.000 --> 38:31.000
I guess this is kind of cool.

38:31.000 --> 38:35.000
It's kind of weird that you read this at school, though.

38:35.000 --> 38:45.000
Do you, like, do anything about it?

38:45.000 --> 38:48.000
I'm not so sure about this.

38:48.000 --> 38:51.000
This is some graphic stuff.

38:51.000 --> 38:54.000
Is it Japanese fashion trend?

38:55.000 --> 39:02.000
Can you show me a picture on your phone?

39:02.000 --> 39:05.000
I can't really tell what's going on in this picture.

39:05.000 --> 39:09.000
It's like she's up high.

39:09.000 --> 39:14.000
Her legs are kind of all over the place.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
When you're bored at school, what do you do?

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
I don't think you do this.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
I don't think you do that.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
I don't think anybody does that.

39:22.000 --> 39:27.000
Why would you do that?

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
You'd rather not say?

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
Why are you being shy with me?

39:31.000 --> 39:34.000
Why did you take this out of your backpack then?

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
Huh? Tell me.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
Why do you have this?

39:38.000 --> 39:47.000
Where did you get this?

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
It's kind of weird that you have this.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
The art's nice or whatever.

39:51.000 --> 39:58.000
But, like, I don't...

39:58.000 --> 40:01.000
I'm not sure about this one.

40:01.000 --> 40:04.000
This is kind of weird.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
You don't read it at school.

40:06.000 --> 40:09.000
You're holding it for a friend.

40:09.000 --> 40:13.000
You know, you do hang out with weird people.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
And you do kind of smell bad.

40:15.000 --> 40:18.000
Like...

40:18.000 --> 40:23.000
Why do you smell so bad?

40:23.000 --> 40:27.000
Yeah, my nose is stuffy, but I can still tell

40:27.000 --> 40:32.000
that you smell so bad.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
My God.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
Do you, like, ever shower?

40:36.000 --> 40:40.000
Like, didn't we have, like, gym class today?

40:40.000 --> 40:44.000
When was the last time you showered?

40:44.000 --> 40:47.000
I need to blow my nose.

40:47.000 --> 40:54.000
Because I need to blow off this stinky...

40:54.000 --> 40:57.000
Your shower is broken.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
I guess you can, you know...

40:59.000 --> 41:02.000
You can shower in my house if you want.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
I'm sure my...

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
I have...

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
My older brother came, like...

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
Like, he borrowed someone's clothes.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
I don't know if they'll fit you, though.

41:11.000 --> 41:14.000
Maybe you can fit into my sister's clothes.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
So if you decide to take a shower,

41:16.000 --> 41:19.000
you can dress up in my sister's clothes.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
Or, you know, you're kind of small.

41:21.000 --> 41:24.000
Maybe you can fit my clothes.

41:24.000 --> 41:29.000
I better have a t-shirt for you.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
Yeah, I...

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
You're gonna...

41:33.000 --> 41:38.000
You're gonna need that shower, I think.

41:38.000 --> 41:42.000
Because, like...

41:42.000 --> 41:46.000
Yeah, my sister.

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
Oh, my brother.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
My sister, if it were that...

41:50.000 --> 41:51.000
She doesn't have to know.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
We have to tell her.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
I read her panties all the time.

41:55.000 --> 42:03.000
Don't tell her I said that.

42:03.000 --> 42:06.000
Hmm...

42:06.000 --> 42:11.000
Is my sister single?

42:11.000 --> 42:20.000
Well, she's 14, so you tell me.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
I just think we'd fit her clothes,

42:22.000 --> 42:28.000
because you guys are, like, the same size.

42:28.000 --> 42:34.000
I think I gotta sneeze again.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
Ah!

42:36.000 --> 42:48.000
She has cute clothes, and I like to take them.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
I'm kidding.

42:50.000 --> 42:53.000
She's my age.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
And we're both in school.

42:55.000 --> 42:56.000
We're literally in the same grade.

42:56.000 --> 42:57.000
She's my twin sister.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
You've seen her before.

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
Shibani?

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
You've seen Shibani?

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
That's my sister.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
I'm Shibani.

43:06.000 --> 43:12.000
And my sister is Shibani.

43:12.000 --> 43:16.000
We have very different tastes.

43:16.000 --> 43:20.000
My brother right now thinks he's, like, a London drill rapper.

43:20.000 --> 43:28.000
He might be able to hear him in the next room.

43:28.000 --> 43:31.000
Yeah, he's kind of weird.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
Yeah, Shibani is darkness.

43:33.000 --> 43:34.000
She calls herself that.

43:34.000 --> 43:39.000
Her real name is really just, um...

43:39.000 --> 43:44.000
Shibritney, but if she don't tell her, I told you that.

43:44.000 --> 43:48.000
She hates her name.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.000
I'm Shibethani.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
She's technically Shibritney,

43:51.000 --> 43:54.000
but she likes to be called Shibani.

43:54.000 --> 43:57.000
Shibani.

43:57.000 --> 44:02.000
I'm a really big family.

44:02.000 --> 44:06.000
I need a sneeze.

44:06.000 --> 44:07.000
That?

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
Phew!

44:09.000 --> 44:12.000
I don't know my panic.

44:12.000 --> 44:15.000
I'm not a strong sneeze.

44:15.000 --> 44:18.000
I mean, don't worry about it.

44:18.000 --> 44:21.000
Um, does she call me a prep?

44:21.000 --> 44:22.000
Yeah, she does.

44:22.000 --> 44:25.000
I don't know why she does that.

44:25.000 --> 44:26.000
I don't know.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
Does your brother have a sister complex?

44:28.000 --> 44:33.000
I don't know what that means.

44:33.000 --> 44:34.000
Does he have a stroke?

44:34.000 --> 44:35.000
Should we call an ambulance?

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
Yeah, you know, we did that before,

44:37.000 --> 44:40.000
but he just got mad at us.

44:40.000 --> 44:44.000
So, it is what it is.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
Thank you.

44:46.000 --> 44:52.000
Um, I guess since I'm done copying your notes and stuff

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
and you showed me that weird book,

44:54.000 --> 44:57.000
I'm just going to hop on the computer

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
and I'm going to, you know,

44:59.000 --> 45:02.000
I'm just going to do some re...

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
I left my body behind.

45:04.000 --> 45:20.000
Um, I'm just going to do some research.

45:20.000 --> 45:26.000
Let me sit better in this chair.

45:26.000 --> 45:35.000
My body is stuck.

45:35.000 --> 45:36.000
There we go.

45:36.000 --> 45:43.000
I was kind of, like, up in the air.

45:43.000 --> 45:50.000
Okay, um, I'm not doing research on a weird thing.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
On a weird book.

45:52.000 --> 46:01.000
I'm just going to do some typing.

46:01.000 --> 46:09.000
I need to set my keyboard up.

46:09.000 --> 46:14.000
Don't worry when I'm looking up,

46:14.000 --> 46:25.000
it's none of your business, okay?

46:25.000 --> 46:30.000
You just say you think I look cute?

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
That's kind of weird for you to say.

46:32.000 --> 46:43.000
We're just, we're just studying together.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
Thanks, I guess.

46:45.000 --> 46:52.000
You weirdo.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
Whatever.

46:54.000 --> 47:10.000
Anyways, I'm going to keep looking up the research.

47:10.000 --> 47:16.000
Oh, there's a lot of these.

47:16.000 --> 47:20.000
This doesn't really have to do with our project,

47:20.000 --> 47:26.000
but it's very interesting.

47:26.000 --> 47:37.000
How did you get into this dojinsha?

47:37.000 --> 47:41.000
Anything about that?

47:41.000 --> 47:44.000
Hey, my head's kind of staying on.

47:44.000 --> 47:47.000
Nope, I'm slowly drifting away.

47:47.000 --> 47:57.000
I don't know how that works.

47:57.000 --> 48:02.000
Hmm.

48:02.000 --> 48:06.000
Interesting.

48:06.000 --> 48:18.000
I can drink a water.

48:18.000 --> 48:24.000
Yeah, I drink cloud, whatever.

48:24.000 --> 48:30.000
Do you have a problem?

48:30.000 --> 48:33.000
Why did you send me a number?

48:33.000 --> 48:36.000
You want me to look up a number?

48:36.000 --> 48:39.000
Okay, what is it?

48:39.000 --> 48:48.000
Okay, okay.

48:48.000 --> 48:51.000
What is this?

48:51.000 --> 48:55.000
A friend said the art reminded him of someone in our class.

48:55.000 --> 48:56.000
Who did that?

48:56.000 --> 48:59.000
Who did it look like in our class?

48:59.000 --> 49:02.000
Who in our class looks like that?

49:02.000 --> 49:10.000
Oh, my God.

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
Oh, my God.

49:12.000 --> 49:19.000
This is what you like to look at?

49:19.000 --> 49:23.000
I think I should just go back to the project,

49:23.000 --> 49:27.000
because I don't even know if we should be in the same room together anymore.

49:27.000 --> 49:31.000
It's kind of weird to me now.

49:31.000 --> 49:38.000
It's kind of weird to me now, girl.

49:38.000 --> 49:44.000
Anyways, I will continue to type up the paper.

49:44.000 --> 49:48.000
Is that okay with you if I type up the paper?

49:48.000 --> 49:56.000
Or do you want to type up the paper?

49:56.000 --> 50:08.000
I don't want to look at the art you like anymore.

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
I don't really think this is art.

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
This is just weird.

50:12.000 --> 50:16.000
Why are you so mean?

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
Come on, why?

50:18.000 --> 50:21.000
Don't understand.

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
You want to type it?

50:23.000 --> 50:26.000
You want me to type it?

50:26.000 --> 50:27.000
I can type it.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
You already wrote some strong bits.

50:29.000 --> 50:30.000
Okay, fine.

50:30.000 --> 50:31.000
Fine, fine, fine.

50:31.000 --> 50:34.000
You can just lay on the bed.

50:34.000 --> 50:38.000
Shoot me some ideas to write about for our literature,

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
history literature paper.

50:40.000 --> 50:51.000
About 18th century literature, yeah.

50:51.000 --> 50:52.000
What?

50:52.000 --> 51:06.000
Okay, I can add that.

51:06.000 --> 51:07.000
I don't like that word.

51:07.000 --> 51:13.000
What's another word for big?

51:13.000 --> 51:17.000
What's another word for big?

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
Yeah, I know, I could look it up in this episode.

51:19.000 --> 51:27.000
I don't want.

51:27.000 --> 51:30.000
What's another word for cylinder?

51:30.000 --> 51:35.000
Big cylinder?

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
Humongous?

51:37.000 --> 51:43.000
Okay, humongous cylinder, but from your own cylinder or something?

51:43.000 --> 51:50.000
That cylinder is so basic.

51:50.000 --> 51:51.000
Massive.

51:51.000 --> 51:52.000
I like massive.

51:52.000 --> 51:57.000
Massive cylinders are good.

51:57.000 --> 51:58.000
Rod?

51:58.000 --> 51:59.000
I get it.

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
Rod is a cylinder.

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
Shaft?

52:03.000 --> 52:10.000
Hmm, let me see how it works.

52:10.000 --> 52:18.000
In this essay, me and anonymous, I can call you that, right?

52:18.000 --> 52:19.000
Yeah?

52:19.000 --> 52:20.000
Okay.

52:20.000 --> 52:35.000
Will be analyzing the historical importance of humongous rods in 18th century literature.

52:35.000 --> 52:39.000
Yes, I think that's good.

52:39.000 --> 52:50.000
Do you think that does that sound okay to you?

52:50.000 --> 52:51.000
No credit?

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
What do you mean no credit?

52:53.000 --> 52:54.000
That's your name.

52:54.000 --> 52:57.000
You write that every time I look at your paper.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
I'm not cheating on you or anything.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
I'm not cheating off of you.

53:01.000 --> 53:05.000
I mean, it's not like we were together in the first place.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
It's not like I could cheat on you anyway.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
It's not like I ignored it suddenly.

53:09.000 --> 53:12.000
I mean, cheat off your papers.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
I mean, no, I don't.

53:14.000 --> 53:15.000
No, I don't.

53:15.000 --> 53:16.000
How can you cheat off your papers?

53:16.000 --> 53:32.000
You write your name as anonymous, so I thought that was your name.

53:32.000 --> 53:44.000
Let me, I'm just going to Google some photos for the insert into the paper of humongous

53:44.000 --> 53:47.000
rods in 18th century.

53:47.000 --> 53:48.000
Okay.

53:48.000 --> 53:56.000
Humongous rods in 18th century literature.

53:56.000 --> 53:59.000
Excuse me.

53:59.000 --> 54:09.000
Oh, I didn't know they had this sort of stuff back then, but this is not what I meant.

54:09.000 --> 54:12.000
I don't, what is going on in this photo?

54:12.000 --> 54:13.000
Can you come here?

54:13.000 --> 54:14.000
Come here.

54:14.000 --> 54:15.000
Come here.

54:15.000 --> 54:16.000
Get off the bed.

54:16.000 --> 54:17.000
Come here.

54:17.000 --> 54:18.000
Come here.

54:18.000 --> 54:19.000
Come here.

54:19.000 --> 54:20.000
Come here.

54:20.000 --> 54:21.000
Come here.

54:21.000 --> 54:22.000
Come here.

54:22.000 --> 54:23.000
Come here.

54:23.000 --> 54:24.000
Come here.

54:24.000 --> 54:25.000
Come here.

54:25.000 --> 54:26.000
Come here.

54:26.000 --> 54:27.000
Come here.

54:27.000 --> 54:28.000
Come here.

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
Can you tell me what's on it?

54:31.000 --> 54:32.000
It's a what.

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
Or don't, what?

54:34.000 --> 54:35.000
No way.

54:35.000 --> 54:40.000
You're joking.

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
Humongous rods.

54:42.000 --> 54:49.000
That's something like a humongous rod I was looking for.

54:49.000 --> 54:50.000
That's so weird.

54:50.000 --> 54:55.000
I was like, I'm sorry.

54:55.000 --> 55:07.560
Ok get away from me Particularly

55:07.560 --> 55:14.080
It's amazing press I don't...

55:14.080 --> 55:17.280
Of All this just like what animals do I can't put that in

55:17.280 --> 55:21.720
Yea Yea Yea lets add that

55:21.720 --> 55:24.480
And during research

55:24.480 --> 55:52.480
What's the author's name? What was the author's name of that article? Do you remember the teacher told us in class?

55:54.480 --> 56:10.480
Does anybody know? Because I don't know. Do you know what the author's name was? I can't really remember. I have a really bad memory.

56:11.480 --> 56:21.480
Why do I think the teacher is quite the killer? So if we write this stuff, I don't know if we're not in the mood. It's fine. It's fine.

56:22.480 --> 56:38.480
Oh yeah, Hugh Janus. Yeah, okay. Yeah, but the author's Hugh and Janus. Well, the Janus or Janus? Janus? Okay.

56:38.480 --> 56:56.480
Oh yeah, I forgot about the author, Mike Coney. Mike Coney was very prevalent. Very important in this day and age. Let me look up Mike Coney.

57:08.480 --> 57:37.480
I don't know what these tacos are doing on this, but that's fun. Some of these girls look like me. What's up with that?

57:38.480 --> 57:59.480
I'll add that in. Oh, the teacher mentioned something about a very important event over. Oh my gosh, you're right. I see. I'm kind of, you know what?

57:59.480 --> 58:14.480
I apologize for picking on you earlier. You see, I know that you're really smart and I'm sorry that sometimes I take you for granted and I'm really sorry about that.

58:14.480 --> 58:32.480
I'm sorry for all the names I called you behind your back. Like, I called you stinky and I thought you were weird and I said you were dumb and I said you have no friends and no one will love you and that you're a piece of trash, but I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it, okay?

58:32.480 --> 58:49.480
Um, but let me add that stuff. The reconnaissance or the renaissance?

58:50.480 --> 59:00.480
Okay. There's a lot of good names. Thank you. Keep them coming. Keep them coming. Keep them coming.

59:00.480 --> 59:29.480
Hmm. There's a lot of good information. Especially after the earthquake in Italy during a holy day. Okay. Do you kind of like when I insult you?

59:30.480 --> 59:39.480
Do you like when I insult you? That's weird.

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:26.480
It was the start of the enlightenment. Yes, but that was 16th century. It was not 18th century. Thank you, other classmate, that's happened to poke her head into the room.

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:55.480
Okay. I messed up. I need to raise this tie by a graph. Oh, I can hold down the button. Oh. Anyway. You have self-esteem problems? Why do you have self-esteem problems? You don't need self-esteem problems.

01:00:55.480 --> 01:01:20.480
I know you smell bad, but I guess you're a little cute. Only a little. Forget I said it. You're still weird. I'm not talking through after this project.

01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:40.480
That's a lot of typing.

01:01:40.480 --> 01:02:06.480
There's an illustrative work on the treatment of 18th century prisons reenact the present day. Okay. I'll type that in.

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:34.480
What did you say? You want me to go out with you? I can't do that. My mom says I'm not allowed to date. I'll think about it.

01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:47.480
Oh. Those are images. I don't think we can include this in our project. I need a tissue.

01:02:47.480 --> 01:03:16.480
Can you pass me the tissue? This is my normal thing now. You're rubbing a tissue over your face before you get it.

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:38.480
I think I hear my mom coming. She's probably going to ask us if we want any food, so you can tell her what you want.

01:03:38.480 --> 01:04:04.480
Honey, did you and your friend want to snack? Oh, you'll tell me later. All right. Keep me in the nose, sweetheart.

01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:22.480
You've got to tell me what you want, and then I'll tell my mom. Oh, hi. I think we have more classmates joining us for our project.

01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:30.480
We are writing about 18th century literature and its impact on history.

01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:41.480
My name is Shababani.

01:04:41.480 --> 01:05:08.480
Stop saying my mom is hot. She's nice, but she's not hot. My aunt taught her. My aunt, she'd be really hot. She runs a hotel. It's really cool. I'm not there sometimes. She lets me swim in the pool. You like pool?

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:12.480
Yeah? Oh, maybe I'll make you some time.

01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:28.480
Have you heard of it? It's called Wonderland Hotel. How's it go? Like an Alice Wonderland thing? It's pretty cool.

01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:39.480
My mom? I don't know what the other one is.

01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:53.480
I haven't seen her talk to anybody. She never brings people around. And if they do, they're usually wearing a mask, and usually it's a weird scary mask, and mom doesn't like it when she brings them around.

01:05:53.480 --> 01:06:01.480
They're also on leashes. I don't know why. But I like the style, though. That's why I wear this collar. I think it's cute.

01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:21.480
My older brother says it makes me look subby. I don't know what subby means. I like sub. Yeah, I'll take you some time. I guess. She's not a date or anything. It's not a date.

01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:37.480
Um, anyways, I think I'm done with typing. Can you, like, proofread this for me?

01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:53.480
Come on. Sorry. My family is little hands. I don't know if you know this.

01:06:53.480 --> 01:07:19.480
Subby is playing for Subaru with cars. Oh, I like cars. Cars are cool. They go vroom. Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom.

01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:25.480
Yeah, we're bullhound rabbits.

01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:51.480
Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom. Do you like cars? I like cars.

01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:56.120
I um, I can lightning McQueen. Yeah

01:07:57.800 --> 01:08:00.300
You like lightning McQueen? I love cars

01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:09.960
Um, so what do you think of the paper?

01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:20.600
Okay

01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:26.680
I guess I can rewrite this paragraph or maybe I should just make you do it

01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:29.400
Since you want to be so bossy and just lay on my back

01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:34.920
You know what I should do

01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:44.920
I want you to stand up

01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:48.360
Stand up

01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:51.240
Thank you

01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:54.360
Sit at the computer and type it yourself

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:03.720
Go on

01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:08.520
Good

01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:13.160
Wait, wait, wait, you got it to put that there

01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:18.200
You got it? No, you got it

01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:24.760
Dude, let me move over. Okay, so you got it. You don't want to use this program, do you? And then

01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:28.040
You gotta do this

01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:31.720
And then

01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:36.760
No, you you have really bad grammar. Why do you keep typing stuff wrong?

01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:40.280
Are you like dumb or something?

01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:43.240
I can't I thought you were smart

01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:47.240
Oh

01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:49.640
Yeah, just type it like that

01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:53.400
Perfect

01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:55.640
Now keep going

01:09:57.080 --> 01:10:03.160
Why did you type that doesn't make any sense? No, your syntax is all wrong. Don't move over. How much?

01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:08.040
You have to type it like this

01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:14.360
Like that that makes more sense. Okay, does that make more sense to you?

01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:19.320
You're trying to get a rise out of me? You're getting distracted

01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:23.800
What's distracting me? What's the matter?

01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:37.160
I'm close to you? What's um, I'm not that close. Is there something wrong with me being really close?

01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:43.160
I don't mind being close to you

01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:46.920
I think I'm getting used to how you smell

01:10:55.640 --> 01:11:00.840
I'm sorry, I know this is stuffy, but I can't stop smelling you

01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:04.760
So

01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:08.280

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
I'm starting to like

01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:29.400
Sorry, I didn't mean to listen to your face

01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:34.520
I'll just wipe your face

01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:57.640
I'm so sorry, but I've got your lips. I bet you feel so lucky. I don't have my spittle over your face from season one

01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:07.320
Okay, I think I got most of it off

01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:10.280
Um

01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:22.280
You want me to say something again, I don't think I should do that

01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:25.880
Um

Mom, do you have any? Do you have any chicken eggs?

01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:02.280
Excuse me mom

Although my brother might have some in the room

01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:19.640
I can go sneak in but he doesn't like it when I go into the room. He gets real weird about it

01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:25.080
I think I've actually seen one of those like dojinshi things dojinchais

01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:27.000
um

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:34.440
He also likes to watch a lot of hentie. I've heard him listening to hentie. He said it's really intense fighting

01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:36.440
um

01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:37.880
cartoons

01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:42.600
So I can't just leave him to it. Um when he's interested when he's doing that

01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:46.520

01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:52.200

My mom is kind of wet. I don't know that mean

01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:24.680
Where did you get that picture from to hold that up in front of your face? That's weird

01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:29.000
How it's like my aunt? Huh weird. She likes to wear heels like that

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000

Are you to be the older one? I'm childish. What do you mean me and me and so britney are the same age we're twins

01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:57.960
I remember others the older and then I do have more siblings, but they'll be introducing a later episode

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000

My head's getting smaller in anger

01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:40.600
I'll show you a pushover in a moment. Just you wait

01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:48.120
And let's see

01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:52.680

What why are you looking at me like that?

01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:41.800
Yeah

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Why are you making that face?

01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:06.760
Why are you covering your pants with your hands?

01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:10.440
I never get boys

01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:20.360
Anyways, I'm gonna drink my apple juice. Oh accidentally got over me. Oh, no

01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:26.200
I got apple juice over my head

01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:33.160
That's not with a couple

01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:39.160
Mm-hmm

01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:51.880
If you want to sip yeah, I know you have your own but I'm just offering to share

01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:53.880
Hmm

01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:06.520
Mm

01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:24.840
Uh

01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:35.080
That's pretty good

01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:39.240
Okay, so yourself

01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:48.120
Can we hold hands I don't know my hands are sticky

01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:51.080
It is for the apple juice

01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:56.040
I don't think that would be a good idea

01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:21.080
I

01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:42.760
Aren't some wet wipes next to my bed

01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:54.920
Sorry, I have the tendency to chew with my mouth open

01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:08.440
No, I got off of you. I'm not on top of you anymore

01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:21.080
I'm not on top of you

01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:36.760
Wait, I dropped some fishies on the floor. Hold on

01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:43.160
Um

01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:51.080
I

01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:54.760
Let me move my body

01:23:58.920 --> 01:24:00.920
There you go

01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:07.240
Oh, there's some fishies on the floor

01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:14.360
I think I'm wearing a good floor fishies

01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:20.120
Hmm

01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:34.600
Ah

01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:37.560
That was good

01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:40.760
Why are you making that face?

01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:51.240
I like the cheese five second rule

01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:09.640
You get too close, what do you mean I'm too close? I'm just I'm just getting some food

01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:16.600
You have a little something on your face

01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:34.120
I don't know why you were eating but it's pretty tasty

01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:44.120
Why are you looking at me like that I was just helping you wipe your face

01:25:59.640 --> 01:26:03.720
Did I just look your face I guess you could call it that

01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:12.200
But um, I don't know in my culture. It's normal to like

01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:20.520
Don't worry about it, okay

01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:30.760
Don't worry about it

01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:38.840
Yeah, I could use a tissue, but I thought it'd just be faster

01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:43.320
Than crossing the whole room for a tissue and coming back

01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:48.280
Since my culture, can I do the same to me?

01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:52.600
You

01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:55.480
Um

01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:57.800
I I guess

01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:02.840
I guess you can

01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:11.800
Um, okay, I guess I'll I guess I'll get a little closer

01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:16.520
Um, okay

01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:19.960
Go on

01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:24.520
Do it

01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:36.840
Uh feels funny

01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:41.320
Why are you doing it like that?

01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:48.360
Okay, stop it's not particularly me stop it

01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:55.240
Okay

01:28:02.040 --> 01:28:04.040

01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:32.840
Let me shrink my head

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Why are you barking at me?

01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:50.760
I it was just a joke

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:55.400
Do you actually want to be my pet?

01:28:58.040 --> 01:29:00.040
It's so weird

01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:02.440
I guess

01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:07.960
Hmm, I guess I would have to get you a collar like mine. You can match

01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:09.960

I don't get bullied like you for being weirdo for liking video games

01:30:02.200 --> 01:30:04.200
Your neck is what

My mom says just just ignore them

01:30:53.800 --> 01:30:59.080
When they come over they're so usually a different one every time she comes over they always wear a mask

01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:05.560
My mom says she might stop inviting aunt she be over but I really like aunt she be

01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:11.160
She has a lot of money and she has a hotel and I get to jump and sleep in the beds in order room service

01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:13.800
As much as I want

01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:21.080
And she has like servants take care of me whenever I need something and they will buy me stuff and get me candy

01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:24.520

01:31:56.920 --> 01:32:01.160
I don't know what people do in the basement. She said it's um

01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:04.040

01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:12.600
So I can't do it

01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:24.360
Hotel song from letter. Yeah, my aunt runs the hotel. You've probably heard about it. It's a very famous hotel. Mm-hmm

01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:26.600
Mm-hmm

01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:32.760

01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:36.520
No, I don't play league

01:32:37.800 --> 01:32:39.800
One of my friends from school does though

01:32:43.160 --> 01:32:47.720
She's really cute. She's like a lamb and she's green

01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:52.440
Our moms are like cool lady

01:32:55.320 --> 01:32:58.840
I tried to play that game. I don't like it that much

01:33:03.480 --> 01:33:07.640
Melania, what are you doing? Melania get out from under my desk

01:33:13.160 --> 01:33:15.160
Why are your eyes so big?

01:33:16.920 --> 01:33:18.920
Oh

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
Oh

01:33:21.320 --> 01:33:23.800
Yeah, that's her mom's name. Her mom's name is Azura

01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:33.000
She's hot. She's really big bazonga hangers. I can't help but stare every time her mom picks her up from school

01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:36.600
What games did I play?

01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:38.520
um

01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:40.520
I play um like

01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:43.960
I play like

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
I play like animal crossing

01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:54.520
Well, my brother says it's a game for babies, but I don't care. I like it. I like mario pie

01:33:58.040 --> 01:34:00.040
Yeah

01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:04.920
They're they're pretty mesmerizing

01:34:05.960 --> 01:34:07.960
What's the vn

01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:10.440
A visual novel

01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:14.520
I don't really like reading reading is for losers

01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:19.720
And I know you're like a loser and all but like

01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:25.400
Don't just because we're doing this project together doesn't mean they're our friends

01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:33.880
Just because I showed you parts of my my zolehan bunny culture doesn't doesn't mean anything

01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:39.640
So don't let it get to your head as auntie she be says don't get it twisted

01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:46.840
Auntie she be usually gets twisted up and something because she wears ropes on her body mom won't explain to me

01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:51.000
Not why um auntie she be does that so I stopped asking

01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:58.440
But then your sister read all the time she does she's a loser. I don't like my sister. She's weird

01:34:58.440 --> 01:35:01.640
She just her room is black. She always has her shades drawn

01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:07.720
She she just like cries all the time and like she has like leaves ketchup packets everywhere

01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:11.480
And her room just smells of ketchup. It's really weird

01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:14.600
My mom says she's going through a phase

01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:17.240
I don't know

01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:23.240
No, I don't want to be friends. I don't want to be friends with you. You're just

01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:27.320
A weirdo

01:35:28.040 --> 01:35:30.040
Just because we hang out

01:35:31.480 --> 01:35:33.480
One time doesn't mean

01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:36.200
weird friends or

01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:40.920
Boyfriend girlfriend or anything. Yeah, I said I take you to the wonderland hotel, but

01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:45.880
Don't um, it doesn't mean anything. I'm just being nice

01:35:48.120 --> 01:35:50.120
Hmm

01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:52.680
I'm just being nice

01:35:59.240 --> 01:36:01.880
Oh, you've heard of my sister she's so weird

01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:08.920
I'm not I I still like to think about it and I thought about it. I don't want to go out with you. You're weird

01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:16.680
But I

01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:22.600
Like I do need to keep you around to help me with my homework. So

01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:26.200
You'll be my pet

01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:28.120
Got it

01:36:28.120 --> 01:36:29.800
I'll get you

01:36:29.800 --> 01:36:34.360
A nice leash and I'll drag you around school with it

01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:39.320
I think that's a good compromise, isn't it?

01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:51.480
My head bigger. Oh, and I have a really big head

01:36:56.200 --> 01:36:58.200
Let me get a little closer

01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:01.880
You

01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:07.960
Will you be my pet

01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:14.520
My my aunt taught me this trick. Do you want to see a trick?

01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:18.360
I have a leash

01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:21.240
I know my hand doesn't match my body

01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:25.880
But don't worry about that. I have a leash

01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:29.960
So I always have one on hand

01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:33.800
I'll tighten it when necessary

01:37:36.200 --> 01:37:38.200
Okay

01:37:38.520 --> 01:37:45.160
And then every time you see me in the homies you have to drop to your knees and you have to kiss my shoes

01:37:46.840 --> 01:37:48.840
Got it

01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:51.400
While you kiss my shoes

01:37:56.120 --> 01:37:59.480
How do I have them? I just I don't know

01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:02.280
I have it

01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:06.760
So will you be my puppy?

01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:11.400
I'll take care of you

01:38:11.960 --> 01:38:19.320
I'll call you bad name and I'll take you for walking and maybe I'll let you sleep under my bed

01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:29.560
Okay, do you want to have a sleepover? Maybe I'll let you sleep with me by my hand

01:38:35.640 --> 01:38:39.080
And you can call me mistress, step up in me

01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:41.080
And

01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:48.360
Appropriate school? Well, it's only inappropriate if the teachers find out, isn't it?

01:38:49.240 --> 01:38:51.880
But teachers don't have to find out anything, do they?

01:38:54.200 --> 01:38:56.280
It will be our little secret, won't it?

01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:07.240
Looks like you're already excited to get started

01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:15.800
Should we practice some training?

01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:32.120
What's wrong with your pants? They look like they're getting bigger. What's up with that?

01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:38.920
Why does that keep happening? Are you hiding something in there? I want to see

01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:47.160
I think you should show me what's going on

01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:51.880
And once we take care of that problem

01:39:54.760 --> 01:39:56.760
Then maybe we can get started

01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:04.760
Hmm

01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:14.200
It's your phone? Your phone is very warm

01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:19.320
Hmm, I just want to

01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:21.320
Uh

01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:31.320
Nah, your phone's a weird shape. Are you sure? Are you hiding something from me?

01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:37.880
You know, bunnies have very good noses

01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:40.440
I

01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:49.480
Think something in there is making me sneeze. I have to check it out

01:40:55.880 --> 01:41:00.280
It's very smells stronger than you

01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:02.280
Hmm

01:41:07.400 --> 01:41:09.400
There's something about it that I like

01:41:17.880 --> 01:41:21.160
All right, are you gonna show me or what?

01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:28.840
Go on

01:41:31.080 --> 01:41:33.080
Oh

01:41:41.640 --> 01:41:43.640
What's that?

01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:49.160
Um, what is that?

01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:55.080
Hmm

01:41:57.800 --> 01:41:59.800
Hmm

01:42:00.600 --> 01:42:07.080
I didn't expect to see that

01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:10.600
Um

01:42:14.680 --> 01:42:21.960
I've never seen one of these in person before

01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:23.960
Uh

01:42:28.680 --> 01:42:30.680
Can I

01:42:32.520 --> 01:42:34.520
Have a taste

01:42:34.520 --> 01:42:36.520
Hmm

01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:54.200
I can't believe you got the limited edition orange creamsicle from lint chocolate. It's so tasty

01:42:55.080 --> 01:42:57.080
I know you're hiding something from me

01:42:58.440 --> 01:43:01.640
You know, I love orange flavored stuff. I'm a bunny

01:43:05.480 --> 01:43:10.360
Now it's a hot day too. Did you take this from my mom's fridge? I bet you did

01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:14.760
Hmm

01:43:15.160 --> 01:43:17.160
Whatever it can't be helped

01:43:19.080 --> 01:43:25.000
I know my mom says she was gonna get these, you know, you really shouldn't put ice cream in your pocket. It's kind of weird

01:43:30.520 --> 01:43:33.240
Well, it's mine now, thank you

01:43:35.240 --> 01:43:37.240

01:43:46.840 --> 01:43:48.840

Thought it was gonna last longer. I don't know how popsicles work silly

01:44:11.800 --> 01:44:13.800
You want to share him

Don't ask why it's blue

01:45:14.280 --> 01:45:16.280
Oh

01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:30.440
I don't know if I can handle a little popsicle

01:45:34.040 --> 01:45:36.040
Yeah, it's a long popsicle

01:45:36.040 --> 01:45:38.040
Almost as big as my head

01:45:38.200 --> 01:45:45.400
Actually, this is because of my head. Why am I supposed to fit this all in my mouth? I don't know if I can

01:45:51.640 --> 01:45:53.640
How convenient that I can get it to change size

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
Look I can fit it across my teeth

01:46:03.880 --> 01:46:05.880
Um

01:46:06.200 --> 01:46:08.760
Wow, did you want the rest?

01:46:13.720 --> 01:46:15.720

I tend to lose my head a lot my mom says I need to control my dillahum powers better

01:47:15.880 --> 01:47:17.880

I

01:48:32.760 --> 01:48:34.760
Bit too good at that

01:48:36.120 --> 01:48:38.120
Well, my brother says I'm

01:48:40.600 --> 01:48:42.600
I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding

01:48:56.600 --> 01:48:58.600
I

01:49:04.680 --> 01:49:09.000
Have two tips. Yeah, I've two tips, you know, I did say you could take a shower if you want

01:49:10.920 --> 01:49:13.560
Since you said your water wasn't working at your house

01:49:17.960 --> 01:49:24.680
Guys I was joking I was joking it was a joke. I never share my popsicles with my brothers that'd be weird

01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:29.160
You

01:49:38.680 --> 01:49:40.680
And in me I don't know who in me is

01:49:44.360 --> 01:49:46.360
Oh, wait, I go to school with an in me

01:49:47.560 --> 01:49:51.160
And an icy I always see them together. They're really best friends

01:49:52.520 --> 01:49:54.520
They're nice

01:49:55.480 --> 01:49:59.480
And me always usually has a weird doll with her though and she always wears um

01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:03.800
This really old sweatshirt. It kind of creeps me out and she has this book with her all the time

01:50:04.520 --> 01:50:06.520
I'm too scared to ask her what's in it

01:50:17.480 --> 01:50:19.480
Let me just stop moving

01:50:25.480 --> 01:50:27.480
I

01:50:46.600 --> 01:50:48.600
Let's follow recipes

01:50:55.000 --> 01:51:00.120
Timeline I don't know anything about timelines. Um, do you want to

01:51:02.280 --> 01:51:09.080
A shower together, um, I don't think that'd be okay with my mom

01:51:10.760 --> 01:51:12.760
Um

01:51:16.440 --> 01:51:21.560
I see it's part of a train business. Yeah, her parents. Um her family. Um

01:51:22.360 --> 01:51:24.760
Well, they're bears I think so I'm not really quite sure

01:51:25.160 --> 01:51:28.280
But I think one of her relatives is in the train industry

01:51:28.680 --> 01:51:35.960
And so she's kind of like inherited that I'm not quite sure I have heard about trains. Um on ic so I don't know

01:51:36.920 --> 01:51:38.920
I'm not quite sure

01:51:41.080 --> 01:51:43.880
Um, but I don't think we can do that together

01:51:46.840 --> 01:51:48.840
So, uh

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:56.600
I'll just take you a towel and stuff and I'll be right back

01:52:10.920 --> 01:52:12.920

01:54:42.760 --> 01:54:44.760
So

01:54:59.960 --> 01:55:04.760
Well, you're in the shower I'm glad you don't have a reflection. I don't know

01:55:12.760 --> 01:55:14.760
So

01:55:42.760 --> 01:55:44.760
So

01:56:13.720 --> 01:56:15.720
I

01:56:21.720 --> 01:56:24.920
Are you almost done in the shower you're taking forever

01:56:42.760 --> 01:56:44.760
So

01:57:12.760 --> 01:57:14.760
So

01:57:27.160 --> 01:57:29.560
Hurry up I got a pee

01:57:43.160 --> 01:57:45.160
Oh

01:57:45.480 --> 01:57:47.480
Hmm

01:58:10.760 --> 01:58:12.760
No

01:58:15.640 --> 01:58:18.920
Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't

01:58:21.240 --> 01:58:27.160
I didn't think I heard the shower running but all the kids went in their room. So

01:58:28.600 --> 01:58:30.600
I thought seven eight this

01:58:32.360 --> 01:58:36.440
Left the shower running again. I am so sorry

01:58:37.480 --> 01:58:39.480
um

01:58:39.560 --> 01:58:42.440
Let me oh you already have a towel. I'll

01:58:43.400 --> 01:58:48.760
Grab it change of clothes for you. Um, honey, can you go in to your brother's room?

01:58:51.080 --> 01:58:53.080
Why are they leaving don't know about it

01:58:54.120 --> 01:58:56.120
um

01:58:56.120 --> 01:58:58.120
Are you having a good time?

01:58:58.680 --> 01:59:00.680
Oh, should I you want me to leave?

01:59:01.880 --> 01:59:06.840
Okay, I'm sorry. I'll I'll I'll bring you guys some more snacks later. How are we?

01:59:07.960 --> 01:59:09.960
Uh

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:17.000
I don't know. I'm sorry. I don't know

01:59:32.600 --> 01:59:34.600
Close the damn door

01:59:43.240 --> 01:59:45.240
Oh

01:59:45.640 --> 01:59:47.640
Oh

01:59:47.640 --> 01:59:49.640
Oh

02:00:11.160 --> 02:00:16.120
You're finally done. That's nice. How's your shower?

02:00:18.600 --> 02:00:20.600
Um

02:00:21.880 --> 02:00:25.880
I I thought my mom

02:00:27.320 --> 02:00:29.320
Uh

02:00:29.320 --> 02:00:39.640
Said she was getting some of my brother's clothes. Um, why did you come into my room with just a towel on?

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.560
If you um not

02:00:46.360 --> 02:00:48.360
See where they were left

02:00:57.720 --> 02:01:00.760
Um, I can um

02:01:02.600 --> 02:01:07.260
Go grab those for you. I'll be right back

02:01:16.520 --> 02:01:18.520
Oh

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.640
My gosh, I almost tripped over my dog gold mask. Um

02:01:31.960 --> 02:01:35.160
Here's the clothes there you go

02:01:36.680 --> 02:01:38.680
Uh

02:01:40.520 --> 02:01:44.200
Um, I'll just look away when you you don't have to

02:01:45.560 --> 02:01:47.560
I

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
I'm not peeking

02:02:00.840 --> 02:02:02.840
Are you done yet

02:02:03.240 --> 02:02:05.240
I

02:02:13.560 --> 02:02:15.560
Need

02:02:23.880 --> 02:02:25.880
I'm sorry

02:02:27.320 --> 02:02:29.560
Okay, oh you look fine

02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:32.520
I'm surprised my brother's clothes fit you

02:02:36.600 --> 02:02:38.600
Um

02:02:42.120 --> 02:02:44.120
You um

02:02:45.480 --> 02:02:48.520
Your your hair is still kind of wet

02:02:49.480 --> 02:02:51.480
Uh

02:02:54.200 --> 02:02:58.920
You want some help um drying your hair I can

02:03:01.720 --> 02:03:04.120
I can help move move that

02:03:05.800 --> 02:03:09.160
Uh only only if you want I know

02:03:09.160 --> 02:03:11.160
Uh

02:03:17.720 --> 02:03:19.720
Let me

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:27.560
Let me just wipe your hair

02:03:27.560 --> 02:03:29.560
I

02:03:38.760 --> 02:03:40.760
Don't watch you catching a cold

02:03:44.120 --> 02:03:48.280
What do you mean you'll catch a cold from me looking you I'm just an allergies

02:03:57.560 --> 02:03:59.560
So

02:04:22.360 --> 02:04:24.360
Oh

02:04:28.120 --> 02:04:30.120
I

02:04:51.080 --> 02:04:54.200
Wait a second you smell really good

02:04:58.120 --> 02:05:00.120
Oh

02:05:22.120 --> 02:05:24.120
Wait a second

02:05:25.080 --> 02:05:27.080
Did you use my shampoo

02:05:30.200 --> 02:05:34.440
You used my body wash and my shampoo conditioner

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.000
My stuff is expensive

02:05:40.200 --> 02:05:42.200
Hmm

02:05:42.600 --> 02:05:45.080
Mom gets it special for me from bun fora

02:05:46.680 --> 02:05:48.680
And banalta

02:05:48.760 --> 02:05:50.760
Um

02:05:54.280 --> 02:05:56.280
I guess that suits you

02:05:58.440 --> 02:06:00.440
Having my smell

02:06:02.440 --> 02:06:08.120
Pain completely enveloped in my smell

02:06:14.280 --> 02:06:16.280
I guess you're not so bad

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:25.720
You didn't want to use my brother's a 7-in-1. Yeah, I don't know why you bought that

02:06:25.800 --> 02:06:29.480
I think he got off some like black market website or something. He's weird

02:06:30.360 --> 02:06:32.600
He likes to go on this place called um

02:06:33.880 --> 02:06:35.880
uh

02:06:37.800 --> 02:06:41.720
Six six tune I think I don't know

02:06:43.720 --> 02:06:46.680
He's really secretive about it. He won't let me use this computer

02:06:47.240 --> 02:06:49.880
I don't know what kind of stuff he has on there and I'm too scared to find out

02:06:52.360 --> 02:06:55.320
You'll pay me back. You promise

02:07:00.600 --> 02:07:02.600
You better

02:07:16.680 --> 02:07:22.680
I'm trying to move on my body

02:07:37.800 --> 02:07:41.560
Um, I guess um

02:07:41.560 --> 02:07:48.840
Are we done with our project and studying?

02:07:52.680 --> 02:07:57.400
When are we supposed to turn this in again?

02:08:05.240 --> 02:08:07.240
Two weeks from now

02:08:07.480 --> 02:08:09.240
Oh

02:08:09.240 --> 02:08:10.920
Huh

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000
I thought it was sooner than that

02:08:14.760 --> 02:08:21.080
I guess you'll have to come over every day so we can focus on the project, right?

02:08:26.040 --> 02:08:28.440
We still got so much research to do

02:08:31.880 --> 02:08:35.080
And I still have to train you

02:08:35.160 --> 02:08:42.360
To make sure you look the most perfect little puppy

02:08:44.520 --> 02:08:46.520
I mean

02:08:50.520 --> 02:08:52.520
We have to

02:08:54.200 --> 02:08:59.400
reread some passages and um

02:09:01.480 --> 02:09:03.480
Maybe

02:09:04.440 --> 02:09:07.240
Do some extra research with each other

02:09:09.960 --> 02:09:12.440
Next time you should

02:09:13.880 --> 02:09:18.280
Bring your laptop so you can study on my bed

02:09:19.720 --> 02:09:21.720
Open my books

02:09:23.240 --> 02:09:26.120
And then you won't have to leave my bed ever

02:09:29.400 --> 02:09:32.040
Yeah, does that sound good?

02:09:34.200 --> 02:09:36.200
If we get an A

02:09:38.840 --> 02:09:41.240
I'll give you a special present

02:09:45.960 --> 02:09:48.440
Yeah extra research

02:09:49.560 --> 02:09:54.680
There's still a lot but I don't know and I need you to show me

02:09:58.120 --> 02:10:00.920
Just be nice when you do, okay

02:10:03.480 --> 02:10:05.480
You

02:10:33.480 --> 02:10:35.480
You

02:10:45.640 --> 02:10:48.440
Separation go away

02:11:03.480 --> 02:11:10.440
Did you have a good time studying with her I think I I think I think I could tell we had a good time

02:11:33.480 --> 02:11:35.480
You

02:12:03.480 --> 02:12:05.480
You

02:12:12.280 --> 02:12:17.480
Oh, I was muted how does the new microphone all of the new mic from the go XLR sound

02:12:20.520 --> 02:12:22.520
Muted muted muted

02:12:25.400 --> 02:12:30.280
Are you listening uh, I was I was hanging out with my sister in the next room

02:12:30.440 --> 02:12:32.440
You

02:12:38.040 --> 02:12:40.040
Oh my goodness

02:12:47.800 --> 02:12:49.800
Bit on

02:12:51.240 --> 02:12:54.200
My nieces are very quirky they're very interesting people

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.560
Stop corrupting my knees

02:13:07.160 --> 02:13:09.160
The sound is tinny

02:13:16.600 --> 02:13:20.120
My sound effects were very very loud, okay good to know

02:13:25.320 --> 02:13:28.360
Oh, okay, so was speaking on my good to know thank you

02:13:31.240 --> 02:13:37.320
Again, I'm still trying to figure out the settings for these things. How does this sound tinny?

02:13:42.760 --> 02:13:45.160
Maybe it's I don't know

02:13:45.160 --> 02:13:47.160
Hmm

02:13:55.080 --> 02:13:56.760
I

02:13:56.760 --> 02:14:01.800
My my niece needs to see the world. I'm gonna there's lots of different people that come into the hotel

02:14:01.800 --> 02:14:04.120
I have to show them what they'll she's what they're like

02:14:08.280 --> 02:14:11.960
The mic peaks when you raise your voice, okay good to know thank you. Thank you

02:14:15.240 --> 02:14:20.760
Yes, you know she's getting it stuck or I'm gonna have to call and step she I think they do have step sibling

02:14:22.360 --> 02:14:25.880
Because I think I think her older brother is a step brother. I can't I can't recall

02:14:27.080 --> 02:14:29.080
I'm not super close with my sister's kids

02:14:31.400 --> 02:14:35.880
Every once in a while, um, I'll pick up shabbani and shabbathani

02:14:38.600 --> 02:14:42.520
She wanted to be called mistress. Oh, I don't know where she got that from

02:14:45.480 --> 02:14:49.880
What is causing the floating head syndrome with my outfits, um

02:14:51.080 --> 02:14:53.080
So I'll show you actually

02:14:53.960 --> 02:14:58.760
So what I use so these are booth booth assets that you see

02:15:00.200 --> 02:15:03.800
So let's say I'll use this one for example the one I used for shabbani

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000
So this is literally a little asset

02:15:09.480 --> 02:15:11.240
And

02:15:11.240 --> 02:15:13.240
you have to

02:15:13.560 --> 02:15:18.120
Kind of click it but the physics sometimes can be a lot

02:15:19.480 --> 02:15:21.480
And so what I have to do

02:15:22.520 --> 02:15:24.520
because each time

02:15:24.600 --> 02:15:29.320
I'm going to do a zero was showing me she made a toggle where it takes her head

02:15:31.640 --> 02:15:38.200
Her I have to go through and make a toggle where I have to literally make everything transparent besides my neck

02:15:38.200 --> 02:15:44.360
And head and hair and ears and they're like really my lower half

02:15:45.240 --> 02:15:47.880
And then I need to make a toggle of that so I can do it a lot easier

02:15:47.880 --> 02:15:51.720
So it sticks a little bit better as you can see when this is the asset

02:15:52.120 --> 02:15:55.400
It sticks a lot better when my head is the asset in vtube studio

02:15:55.480 --> 02:16:00.360
It doesn't stick as well, but I kind of like the charm of that the little like added lower, you know

02:16:00.360 --> 02:16:02.360
Yeah

02:16:06.440 --> 02:16:10.760
Yeah, so like I'll show you so this is the head

02:16:12.200 --> 02:16:16.440
I it's imported and saved as a asset

02:16:18.520 --> 02:16:20.520
In vtube studio

02:16:20.920 --> 02:16:22.920
I don't save it as a model

02:16:23.080 --> 02:16:26.440
Because then I would have to change my model each time and I don't want to do that

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:29.000
So you can see here. Oh look

02:16:30.520 --> 02:16:32.520
There's two of me

02:16:34.520 --> 02:16:41.560
Um if I put this on it clips over and so but it only will stick properly

02:16:46.840 --> 02:16:48.840
You can see the physics

02:16:48.920 --> 02:16:50.920
Get a little wonky with it

02:16:51.160 --> 02:16:56.200
And I've dialed down all the physics. It's just how the I think it's just how it's rigged. Um

02:16:57.160 --> 02:17:03.400
But yeah, you can see even when it's near pinned to my model it kind of floats around

02:17:05.240 --> 02:17:07.240
I still have to figure that out

02:17:11.240 --> 02:17:14.040
Yeah, that's how that works. That's a little behind the scenes

02:17:16.440 --> 02:17:18.440
It kind of looks like my hair is behind

02:17:19.400 --> 02:17:21.400
Ha

02:17:25.640 --> 02:17:27.640
Oh

02:17:32.600 --> 02:17:37.080
Should be three head strikes again a different kind of boing boing

02:17:39.720 --> 02:17:41.720
Okay

02:17:42.680 --> 02:17:44.680
Yeah, shivers I'll be telling you

02:17:46.840 --> 02:17:48.840
Did you pin it to a wobbly piece of hair?

02:17:49.320 --> 02:17:52.520
Honestly, it's hard to tell because I try to pin it to

02:17:53.560 --> 02:17:55.560
like my chest area

02:17:55.720 --> 02:17:57.720
Or my neck and it just doesn't

02:17:58.440 --> 02:18:04.360
Want to stick I've even minimized my model really small to see if I could place the asset over it and kind of make it

02:18:04.440 --> 02:18:06.440
More stable. It doesn't work either

02:18:06.600 --> 02:18:13.800
Um, I know Serenity from me knew I was gonna help me with that any other girls with that so

02:18:15.880 --> 02:18:17.880
Um, but let's see

02:18:18.440 --> 02:18:21.960
I will see you guys later. I am super fucking tired

02:18:23.400 --> 02:18:25.400
She's the perfect woman remember that

02:18:30.120 --> 02:18:34.200
Why does this have a debut under it when it should have I had some more

02:18:35.080 --> 02:18:41.240
Actually, I'll put 3dio ASMR seems to be like get godly

02:18:54.360 --> 02:18:56.360
Working on a project

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:09.400
I did more of a project than studying because I forgot my own

02:19:11.320 --> 02:19:13.320
The thing that came up with

02:19:25.080 --> 02:19:27.080
Okay, let's see

02:19:27.960 --> 02:19:29.960
Hmm

02:19:31.960 --> 02:19:34.840
Probably anybody to raid so I guess I'll just end stream

02:19:35.480 --> 02:19:37.960
Oh, I would read to emmy, but she's not here
