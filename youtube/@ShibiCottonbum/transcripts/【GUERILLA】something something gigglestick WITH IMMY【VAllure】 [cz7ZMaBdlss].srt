1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Work. OBS. Sometimes it just ends after I started. I love it when it does that. Okay, I didn't do it though.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Yippee!

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Maybe you mute myself so I don't hear myself.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Oh my god.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yeah.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Because you are so fucking small.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You are on us. Okay, if we're legit with how tall you are and how tall I am.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So I am like this. My legs are so fucking long, bro. And then there's you. You'd be like down here.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You'd be like that.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Wasn't you? Yeah, you a shawty.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Oh, you're so small. I can just move you around. Yeah, she's like my little doll. Oh wow, she's like my little...

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Oh, you're muted? Oh, you are muted.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You attached me. You attached me to you.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Get me off!

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Oh, you're so cute. It's like I'm holding onto you like a little puppet.

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Set me free. Let me go.

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
My cute little sister and me.

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Okay, I'll make you bigger.

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Oh my god.

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Thank you. Perfect.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,000
A happy family. I can't even see my chat. That's why I didn't know you were muted. Hold on.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Oh my god. So how's everybody doing?

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Hope everyone's doing well. Yeah, I'm getting ads on my own video.

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Wait, really? Yeah.

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I should have just not monetized it. She's a little brats. The immuppet. Oh my god, Emmy Muppet.

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
No, oh my god, people are gonna fuck the immuppet.

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Toma's already working on a Muppet for you.

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Oh, now I gotta use it.

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
She just was doing it for fun for our designs, but she's like, yeah, I just want to make one based off of Muppets.

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
She's making you, she's basing you off of the rat.

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And I'm like, she'll love that.

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Um, but yeah, me and...

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
G-U-E-R-I-L-L-A.

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Did I add an extra L? Okay, no, I didn't.

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So you probably saw the silliness that took place. It looks like we're about to do an apology video.

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
We're sorry for getting Strawny's channel a-straked.

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
We're sorry for cooking you by having sex with each other.

38
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
In discord.

39
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
We will never do such a thing again.

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Oh, really?

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Um, no, but we were just hanging out after our collab earlier and me and Emmy had been cooking up something for you guys.

42
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And so then we wanted to make a joke.

43
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Then I was going through my scripts because I realized I could record scripts at the same time as being in a discord call.

44
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So I'm like, ah, maybe Emmy can give me some pointers or whatever.

45
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Am I moaning? Well, you can tell me.

46
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And I'm reading the scripts and I'm like, wait, what the fuck is off the entirety of October?

47
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Like, what is this? I can't.

48
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And so I'm just posting screenshots and glimpses of the script.

49
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And so I sent it to Emmy.

50
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Um, and I don't know what we're going to do with it.

51
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You want to act it out together?

52
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I think that'd be cool if we just pick the worst one, you think?

53
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Okay, okay.

54
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Because I know for a fact that Strani's not going to have me do the scripts now.

55
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You actually have the names of your scriptwriters. I never have names online.

56
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The last one I don't have names on the scriptwriter and if I figured out who it was, I would fight them.

57
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Because my scripts literally before October are fine.

58
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Okay, okay.

59
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Most of them are not that bad.

60
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
In October?

61
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yeah, I think it's just that one.

62
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
That one? I'm trying to find it. I don't know what that could just do with it.

63
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm reading the other ones and they're not that bad. It's just that one.

64
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Was that number two?

65
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Um, it's number one.

66
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Oh no, you didn't look at number two then.

67
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
What's wrong with number two?

68
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Uh, face-mashing and slurping in a better mood, good snogging.

69
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'll make you forget all about her.

70
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Here on Clash Rock, remember these?

71
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
The most mouth-watering tits you've ever put in your mouth. Play with those.

72
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
What the fuck are you reading?

73
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm reading! I'm reading the second one.

74
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I think it's like a third paragraph down.

75
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Tummy Gurgle. Oh, look who's hungry now.

76
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Sorry funnel cake is gone and the truck usually leaves by now.

77
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm only teasing. I know this is a bit backwards, but how about there?

78
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
That's not that bad.

79
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's not, it's really...

80
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Here, let's start, let's start around the...

81
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
She glurps his giggle stick against her face so much.

82
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Where is, I can't add up to it.

83
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Hold on, let me, let me control find giggle stick.

84
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's up medium.

85
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I have like 101 things that contain giggle in my entire master's group.

86
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Is the giggle stick two words? Okay, it is. I found it.

87
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Okay, do you want to, do you want, I'll do the voice acting part and then you can read the direction?

88
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Sure, sure, sure.

89
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Okay, okay. So I'm going to start at enough.

90
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Enough.

91
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
So if you go a couple sentences up, it's at the beginning of the paragraph.

92
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Enough. She forces herself up.

93
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Oh, I found it, I found it.

94
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Okay, ready?

95
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Take a sip of the water.

96
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You guys are getting glorps on you.

97
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Okay, you guys are getting insider information.

98
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Although I know for a fact the script is not going to be used, but...

99
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Enough.

100
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,000
She forces herself up and splurts his gock from her pummeled vagine.

101
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You didn't have that bad a day to where I'm just going to let you forget your manners. Sit.

102
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
The toilet squeaks in resistance to both of their weight.

103
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You're way too cocky for a man risking his entire livelihood in a public restroom.

104
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And you forget that this rabbit...

105
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
She glorps his giggle stick against her fasal nut.

106
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Is mine.

107
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
She begins sliding down and riding.

108
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Aha, now who look who's whimpering like a bitch?

109
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
That's right, bitch.

110
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Ha.

111
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Domineering Humpery.

112
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You ain't nothing but a bitch to me.

113
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And y'all know, bitches ain't shit to me.

114
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Fucking take it.

115
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Ha.

116
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
If I were caught in make national headlines,

117
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
a bitch like you would probably be a single HR email.

118
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Look at that pathetic fucking face.

119
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
He comes.

120
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Huh? You came?

121
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So...

122
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Plop.

123
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
What?

124
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Plopping intensifies.

125
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I still need mine, bitch.

126
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You selfish motherfucker.

127
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You think you're better than me?

128
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You think you're hot shit?

129
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You think now that you've got a bit of cash?

130
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You can have any girl you want.

131
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Look at you.

132
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You can't even have a girl show up to date you.

133
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And you think you can come before me?

134
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Ha ha.

135
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I bet.

136
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Door opens.

137
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Get the fuck out.

138
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Do the slams, cops!

139
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Ha.

140
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You're nothing.

141
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Nothing.

142
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You're fuck.

143
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Fuck.

144
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
She whimpers into a shuttering orgasm.

145
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Ha.

146
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Oh.

147
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You came again?

148
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Ha.

149
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Oh.

150
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Ha.

151
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Oh.

152
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Wind down.

153
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Like, wait.

154
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Did he leave?

155
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Like the door shut.

156
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I don't...

157
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
No, someone walked in while they were doing it.

158
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
And then left.

159
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
That's what it was.

160
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm dead.

161
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Okay.

162
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Ha.

163
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
That was amazing.

164
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Ha.

165
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Ha.

166
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
She takes some toilet paper to wipe the mess.

167
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Here.

168
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Let me clean you off.

169
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Slurp.

170
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Pop.

171
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Ah.

172
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You all right?

173
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
She begins dressing herself.

174
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I kind of mashed you down into the toilet there.

175
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Here.

176
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Give me your hand.

177
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
She helps him up.

178
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Up you go.

179
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Oh.

180
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Careful.

181
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
That's what it says.

182
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Can't feel your legs.

183
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Come on.

184
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Lean on me.

185
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Door opens.

186
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Uh, or excuse us.

187
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Time skip.

188
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Okay.

189
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Slowly.

190
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Slowly on the bench.

191
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
They sit.

192
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Oh.

193
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'll be right back.

194
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
She leaves.

195
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Returns a bit later.

196
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Here.

197
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Some water.

198
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Hold.

199
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
So nice.

200
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I know.

201
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It's looking nice.

202
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Huh?

203
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Oh, I just have sensitive teeth.

204
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
So, oh yeah.

205
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
They both drink?

206
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
How about the same cup?

207
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I mean, they just, they just fucked in the bathroom.

208
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So whatever.

209
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Listen, I, uh, I'm sorry for what I said back there.

210
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I know.

211
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I know.

212
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I know you're already having a shitty day and, uh, really?

213
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Huh?

214
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
So you like that kind of talk, huh?

215
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I guess with my line of work, I can pick up the kind of person who likes being talked

216
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
down to.

217
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Tell me, Gurgle.

218
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Oh, look who's hungry now.

219
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Sorry.

220
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Funnel cake is gone.

221
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
The truck usually leaves by now.

222
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'm only teasing.

223
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I know this is a bit backwards, but how about dinner?

224
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
My treat.

225
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Can you stand?

226
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
No rush.

227
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
All right.

228
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Come on.

229
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I know a place.

230
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It's not far.

231
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Wow.

232
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
How romantic.

233
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Oh, look at that.

234
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:10,000
The bathroom and then went to, to a park bench.

235
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I don't know.

236
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
No, I'm not.

237
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
We're not even reading fanfics, guys.

238
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
This is a script.

239
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
We're reading Shibi's scripts.

240
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
This is my, that was a script that was handed to me.

241
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And thank you for that.

242
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Do you want to read the first one?

243
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Yeah, we can do it.

244
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Oh, I think, I think the first one's a little bit.

245
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
This has to be an audio.

246
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Come on.

247
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You guys want that to be an audio?

248
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
All right.

249
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
That's the first one.

250
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Oh, this one's ridiculous.

251
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Is it all the pants and part?

252
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Yeah.

253
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
My cat's trying to hop up on my lap.

254
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Not now, Fia.

255
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
We're busy.

256
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Okay.

257
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
We're fucking busy, Fia.

258
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You can start.

259
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Okay.

260
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Beeping key card lock.

261
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Unlock door.

262
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Heels approaching.

263
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Long night.

264
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I startled you, didn't I?

265
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I would have knocked, but I own the place.

266
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I'm sorry.

267
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
She doesn't burp.

268
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Your hotel room.

269
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Your hotel room.

270
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
No, you're right.

271
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
This is a misunderstanding.

272
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Just not the one you think it is.

273
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Here.

274
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Sit.

275
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
She pats the bed.

276
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
You're the one who is with that rowdy crowd at the bar, right?

277
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
The one's cheering like a Super Bowl riot.

278
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
She clicks her tongue shamingly.

279
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
No social awareness whatsoever.

280
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Look at you.

281
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Apologizing.

282
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You're not in trouble.

283
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Not yet, anyway.

284
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Here.

285
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Compliments of the hotel.

286
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
She pops a bottle, pours two drinks.

287
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Actually, I would have celebrated with you all then and there if I wasn't paraded around

288
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
by my usual ass kissers and yes men.

289
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
So, what are we celebrating?

290
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
A promotion?

291
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Oh, cheers to that.

292
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
She swirls her icing soups.

293
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
This is not bad.

294
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Yeah, this one's not that bad, actually.

295
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I don't know if you can hear the...

296
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You probably can't hear the, um, the donos.

297
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
But someone said, thank you for the $2 tip.

298
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Damn, I need a cold shower to calm my giggle stick after that slurping scenario.

299
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Crick the fuck up.

300
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Calm your giggle stick.

301
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Oh, you can't hear them?

302
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
That's fine.

303
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
This was just lily a girl.

304
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Guys, you don't have to donate for this.

305
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Um, okay.

306
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Let me see where was it.

307
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Oh, you sounded...

308
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
What?

309
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Go ahead, sorry, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.

310
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Hmm, you all sounded like you were having so much fun.

311
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
So, why did you leave early?

312
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Tired?

313
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Tired of what?

314
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Huh, you know, I always like that phrase,

315
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
drain social battery.

316
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's a way more polite and succinct than fed up with everyone's bullshit.

317
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Straight to the point, you know.

318
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
She takes one more sip and sets her drink down.

319
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Ooh, which is how I like it.

320
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Hmm, how I like everything, really.

321
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Which brings me to you.

322
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Even as the obvious quiet one of your group of friends,

323
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
you made it so hard not to notice you in that zoo of a booth.

324
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
A cutie.

325
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
She steps forward.

326
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Like.

327
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
She steps forward.

328
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
You.

329
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
She kisses the viewer.

330
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Making out.

331
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
What's this here?

332
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
She rubs his erect stick through his pants.

333
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
That doesn't feel like the stick of a man who's tired.

334
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
In fact, it feels more of a stick that needs to be drained.

335
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
So how about it?

336
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Shall we get to the point?

337
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Good boy.

338
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
She nibbles at his neck kissing while she unbuckles his pants.

339
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Disrose.

340
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Here, let me slide these off.

341
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Now, on the bed.

342
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Good boy.

343
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
She crawls into the bed kissing and rubbing at his hips.

344
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
What is rubbing at his hips mean?

345
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
And now these.

346
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Rubbing those hip bones.

347
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
She slides his tiny lighties off.

348
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
His tiny lighties off.

349
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I didn't catch that one when I read it before.

350
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It's always the quiet ones with the biggest sticks.

351
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Why is that?

352
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Rubbing a man with absolutely nothing to compensate for.

353
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Glock suckering.

354
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Feel nice.

355
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Of course it does.

356
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Slippery slobbering until she stops mid popsicle slurp.

357
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Hey, do not touch the ears.

358
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Good boy.

359
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
She continues into throating.

360
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I think now that we should really get the celebration started.

361
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
What do you say, big shot?

362
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
That's what I like to hear.

363
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Light teasing.

364
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
She slinks out of her ponzu.

365
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Bring that dick here, boy.

366
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
She starts to grind on the tip before lightly slapping him.

367
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Ah, ah, ah, don't get greedy now.

368
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
What's wrong?

369
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Don't like my cat kissing the top of your stick?

370
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Aw, but you're celebrating.

371
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
There's no need to rush this, baby.

372
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
We can party all night if you're able.

373
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Just allow me to savor this a bit slowly.

374
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Slowly on the tip.

375
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
She laughs as she swirls her hips just the bellend half inside.

376
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And that's what it says.

377
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
It says bellend, everyone.

378
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
My big, heavy hips need to savor the shape of the tip.

379
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Aw.

380
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,000
She slides her kitty down the top of his popsicle.

381
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Glides so smoothly against the top of your popsicle.

382
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Look at you.

383
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
We're supposed to be celebrating, weren't we?

384
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I shouldn't be having all the fun, but I'm not fully sure you want this.

385
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Say, if you had to choose between your new promotion and losing that position in exchange

386
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
for sliding the full length of your cat.

387
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I mean, your dog all the way to the base inside of my tight, gripping cat.

388
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
What would you say right now?

389
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Hmm?

390
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Oh, I can't hear you.

391
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Please?

392
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Please, what?

393
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
That's please, madam.

394
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Louder, boy.

395
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Ah, good boy.

396
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Now we can celebrate.

397
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Segs, slow and heavy.

398
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
And it said with two G's.

399
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
With two G's, it says.

400
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Hmm, almost.

401
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:15,000
She be laughs, releasing desperate exiles as she restrains herself to slowly descend down.

402
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
The popsicle in capital letters.

403
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
The Triton.

404
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
The Triton.

405
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Yeah, the Triton's filling me so good.

406
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Here, put your hands here.

407
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Now, little man.

408
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
A nasty laughter.

409
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
You're going to want to hold on.

410
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Heavy slapping, no pants dance, followed by animal grunting.

411
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Yeah, all the way in.

412
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Wetness increases.

413
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Making your way up in the world.

414
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Still yet, ungh, fucking beneath me.

415
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:04,000
No matter how hard you work, you'll always be nothing but a popsicle to do.

416
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
You want that, don't you?

417
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
That's yes, mistress.

418
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Segs pauses.

419
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Wait, wait, wait.

420
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I need this bra off.

421
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:26,000
She releases her fat tiddage free from the burdens of a bra as she catches her breath.

422
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Now.

423
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Oh fuck, sex medium pace.

424
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Have you ever seen a more perfect pair of fucking tits?

425
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Oh, don't even answer that because you haven't.

426
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
And now, I want them in your mouth.

427
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Sex reasons.

428
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Ah, that's it.

429
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Ah, that's...

430
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Monkey noises.

431
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Wait, this does monkey noises?

432
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:02,000
It says monkey noises.

433
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Go on, make the monkey noises.

434
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Ah, another one.

435
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Ah, fit bath for those fat fuckers in your mouth.

436
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Yes, yes.

437
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Sex fast paced.

438
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
More, I want more.

439
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Her pace becomes rapid and animalistic.

440
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
You small time bitch.

441
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Fuck me, you're fucking nobody.

442
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Are you coming?

443
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Coming?

444
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Are you coming?

445
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Fuck.

446
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
He fills sheebie to the brim with a nasty load of pent-up gunk.

447
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Fuck.

448
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Wind down, catching her breath.

449
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Nothing like a little fireworks to cap off a party.

450
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
She slips from her drink.

451
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Oh, goodness.

452
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Look at all that flowing out.

453
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I can tell you're a workaholic with no time to let loose.

454
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Just look how much you let loose in me.

455
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
She laughs and then kisses him.

456
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Look at that.

457
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Such a content little smile.

458
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Not that forced uncomfortable smile around your friends from the bar,

459
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
but a real one.

460
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
It's beautiful.

461
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Oh, me.

462
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
You're too sweet.

463
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I don't want anyone folk in my life,

464
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
but you, I can tell you're different.

465
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Awkward pause.

466
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Oh, um, that's stuff about you being a nobody.

467
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I, um, I was just dirty talk.

468
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I didn't mean that.

469
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Any of it.

470
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Everything good.

471
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
That's um, that's good.

472
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Even more awkward pause.

473
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Oh, um, I forgot that I had more work to do tonight.

474
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
She begins putting her clothes back on.

475
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Oh, um, uh, keep the bottle top shelf stuff.

476
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Or so they tell me.

477
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I just told the bartender to give me something impressive and stiff.

478
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Sounds like you.

479
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Laughter trails off.

480
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
So, um, see ya.

481
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Door closes.

482
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Why was the ending so fucking unsexy?

483
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Oh, come on.

484
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
That was it.

485
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
That was the first group.

486
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
The deku accent.

487
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I literally, I have tears running down my face.

488
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I know me too.

489
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Oh, ooh, ooh.

490
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Oh, tidy whitey.

491
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Tidy whitey.

492
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Oh, my God.

493
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I just had to share this with you guys.

494
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,640
I know, I just tried to do a loser at the end.

495
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:01,480
Thank you for this super LP, 4145.

496
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,000
If this becomes an audio, I will seriously consider

497
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,680
something to my Patreon.

498
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,780
Oh my God.

499
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,200
No, guys, there's literally a full month of October

500
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,840
like this, the fucking monkey noises.

501
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,240
I'm like, do they hate me?

502
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,240
Why did they even write monkey noises?

503
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,160
Oh my God.

504
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,680
Whoever wrote those scripts cooked with gas.

505
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,920
Thank you, feel their love for this super.

506
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,760
All right.

507
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,720
Aside from the mildly racist undertones,

508
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,680
this is pretty funny.

509
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,600
Oh my God, I didn't even think about that.

510
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,440
I didn't notice.

511
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,440
Oh, you see, the sweet precious child.

512
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,960
I love you so much, Emmy.

513
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,920
When you said monkey, I just thought it related

514
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,800
to like animalistic, you know?

515
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,120
Yeah, the animalistic monkey noises.

516
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:07,800
Yeah, but he did write you a little stupidly.

517
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,000
Yeah.

518
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,160
No, so if you guys are new coming in,

519
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:15,120
I was in call with Emmy and we were working

520
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,120
on an audio together for something else

521
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,120
that she will probably finish up at some point.

522
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,520
And I can't wait for you guys to hear that.

523
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,680
We're very excited.

524
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:27,080
But I was like, oh, since I figured out

525
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,120
I can record during a call,

526
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,240
let me look at my stuff right now

527
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,000
and we can just like hang out and I can record

528
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,360
and you can like make fun of me, whatever.

529
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,920
So I'm looking at my October scripts.

530
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,080
I haven't recorded September yet.

531
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,480
I was looking at October because I was like,

532
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,640
oh yeah, what are my scripts again?

533
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,080
I didn't read it that far ahead.

534
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,400
And I'm just like, I'm like, what is this?

535
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,280
And I'm like sending screenshots in our discord

536
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,400
with the other girls.

537
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,080
And I'm like, Strani, Strani, please.

538
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:54,920
What is it?

539
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,760
What is this?

540
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,680
And I'm like, what are these?

541
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,440
What are these?

542
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,480
Oh, I'm like, she definitely, I'm like,

543
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,080
Strani probably had faith in the script writer

544
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,920
or that somebody was trolling

545
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:11,200
and just fucking just did something.

546
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,040
Or I don't know.

547
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:15,440
Maybe someone got hold of the link for my scripts.

548
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,280
I don't know.

549
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,720
So who knows?

550
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,600
I think it's genuinely the script writer.

551
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,440
I want to just note,

552
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,320
because my script writers usually write off

553
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,000
what they've written and this person did it.

554
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,440
And I feel like they did that on purpose.

555
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,520
They were ashamed, they were ashamed.

556
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,340
It's great though.

557
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,740
So that was, that's the first script for,

558
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,320
it's called Entanglements.

559
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,440
It's a Shelby or Shibi.

560
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,920
And it's supposed to be, that was,

561
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,320
it's a four for the entire month.

562
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,320
It's just a continuation.

563
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,200
It's a story.

564
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,200
You know what I think we should do, Amy?

565
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,840
I think we should do the other scripts.

566
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,040
You want to spoil them?

567
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,040
At a later time.

568
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,240
I'll ask Strani if we could do,

569
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,960
I think she'll be fine if we did this one.

570
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,880
But I think if we did that as like a little Mimi joke,

571
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:11,920
or if I record them seriously with you narrating the activity,

572
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,220
I think that would be absolutely peak.

573
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,620
It would.

574
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,460
Yeah.

575
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,860
And we can just like upload both to our,

576
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,180
both of our Patreons.

577
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,620
That would be funny.

578
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:26,460
I don't think any of the other girls had stuff like this.

579
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,940
I think it was just me.

580
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:31,020
Yeah, I don't have anything like that,

581
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,100
but I haven't like,

582
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,940
they haven't written up to October for me.

583
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:35,780
Yeah.

584
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,620
So that's why.

585
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,460
Yeah.

586
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,380
So I don't know if like the script writers,

587
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:43,020
but it's good because it's good that I fucking noticed it

588
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,300
because I would hate for the girls to get other stuff.

589
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:48,620
And like, like I see who I know,

590
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,740
Strani was saying who's ESL might not like,

591
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,300
quite understands like, okay,

592
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,900
I guess I just read this then.

593
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,860
And think that it's like sounds okay when it doesn't.

594
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,940
Honestly though, I think I see would have noticed

595
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:04,020
and been like, what is this?

596
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:04,860
Yeah.

597
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:08,180
I don't think I see would just like read out like,

598
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,020
yeah.

599
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:09,860
Lucky noises.

600
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,900
Oh, this is, this would be funny for April Fool's as well.

601
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:20,100
Just do like a meme-y, like really meme-y,

602
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,700
lewd audios for, oh my God.

603
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,700
I'm asking Strani about that.

604
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,860
I think that's a good idea.

605
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:25,700
Yeah.

606
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,540
It's Tracy and Daddy ESL.

607
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,380
Yeah.

608
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,220
I don't think, yeah.

609
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,740
Yeah, you're right, you're right.

610
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:30,580
Kickles.

611
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,740
Oh my God.

612
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,700
But I hope we didn't stress Strani out too much.

613
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:43,860
I mean, she was gonna find out sooner or later.

614
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:46,540
It'd be funny if I like center the audio.

615
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:48,020
I should, I imagine if I didn't say anything

616
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,660
and I just recorded it, it just said it to her.

617
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:53,100
I don't think she listens to our audio,

618
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,180
so I think it would have passed.

619
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:59,820
I think you're the only one who got scripts like this

620
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,940
because you're the only one to view a letter

621
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,220
that can turn a sex script into a joke

622
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,140
with my impersonations.

623
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,580
It's beat comedy.

624
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:10,020
Thank you for this, I like that.

625
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,540
That's good.

626
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,820
Give that a little heart.

627
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,740
It's for myself.

628
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,060
That's so great.

629
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,060
I guess Strani was more,

630
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,300
way more stressed by her card game.

631
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,220
Yeah, I saw she was, she was sweating a little bit.

632
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,460
Oh my God.

633
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:28,380
But thanks for stopping by Emmy.

634
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,220
I just asked,

635
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,380
because I know Emmy has some stuff to get done.

636
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:35,060
So thank you for spending time with me real briefly.

637
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,460
Thanks for having me.

638
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:41,140
I love you, Emmy.

639
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,380
I love you too.

640
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,820
Have fun, what are you doing next?

641
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,980
I don't know, I'm probably just gonna yap.

642
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,300
Okay, have fun yapping.

643
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,340
Yeah, I'm something, I don't know.

644
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,420
I'll see you later.

645
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,740
Bye, Harold.

646
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,420
And the pin pals.

647
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,740
We got some pin pals in the chat.

648
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:57,060
Pin pals, goodbye, goodbye.

649
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:57,900
See you later.

650
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,220
Bye, bye, bye.

651
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:09,500
Wait, I forget that I have to like, quit the collab.

652
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,180
She's like, stop it.

653
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,420
She's like, doing stuff.

654
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,540
All right, I'm sorry, little sister gone.

655
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,580
Okay.

656
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:28,060
I'm like so far behind in my own bond.

657
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,580
I'm like, what the fuck?

658
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,860
Oh, I'm not leaving it.

659
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,340
I'll probably like stay on for a little bit,

660
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:35,660
but like, yeah, I just had to share that with you guys.

661
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,220
I love Emmy so much.

662
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,060
We've been in call.

663
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:40,460
We were in call together for a little bit,

664
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:43,780
and then Mercy had some stuff to do too.

665
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:47,660
Cause it was literally like me, I see Mercy and Emmy

666
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,820
and Strani for a little bit, just hanging out.

667
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,340
And Strani had a stream.

668
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:54,060
I see how to go to bed to pour a little polar bear.

669
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,700
And Azura was streaming,

670
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:58,820
and then Mercy had to go take care of some stuff.

671
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,740
So, but that was, it was,

672
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:04,020
so yeah, me and, me and Emmy were just like chatting.

673
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:04,980
And I'm just like, you know,

674
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,460
cause she has a lot more experience with me

675
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:10,300
than me with like audios and stuff.

676
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,980
So I was just like grabbing pointers from her.

677
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,300
And she's like, you're doing really good.

678
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,140
I'm like, yeah.

679
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:16,540
And then I'm like, let me look at my audios.

680
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,920
And let me look at my script.

681
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:25,180
And I was like, wait a second, something's not right.

682
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:28,180
Something's not right.

683
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,900
This is the most feeler.

684
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,220
I was really funny.

685
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,380
It was really funny.

686
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,100
It was really fun.

687
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:39,140
Yeah, so the whole month of October is like that.

688
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,860
November and December are still on the writing stage.

689
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:49,140
I haven't started recording September yet,

690
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,380
but I was gonna record September

691
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:54,080
after the, I got off Call of Emmy,

692
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:57,040
but then I got distracted with this.

693
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:03,940
But yeah, cause I think October was supposed to be the month

694
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:06,400
where I was like the Dommie month,

695
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,500
but like, I'll be honest with you.

696
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,380
There's just, you can just like,

697
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:14,520
some of my first scripts were written by like Strani.

698
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,340
And you could tell like a woman wrote them

699
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,960
versus like a man writing this,

700
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,620
although this is definitely very meme-y.

701
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,660
So I don't know if like they were taking it serious.

702
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,500
I don't know.

703
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,620
But then I have like one of our other script writers,

704
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,740
Etwa, and they have good scripts too.

705
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:31,580
So I'm like, they wrote very similarly to Strani.

706
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,900
So I'm like, okay, maybe, I don't know.

707
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,620
Maybe they just like never written before.

708
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,060
I don't know what happened.

709
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,420
I also didn't tweet.

710
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,260
I'm sorry.

711
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,020
I didn't like tweet to say I was live or anything.

712
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,060
I was just like, I'm here.

713
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,180
So I apologize.

714
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:48,020
Cause I was just like, okay, we need to tell the people this

715
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:51,380
and give them an explanation as to what we were doing in Call.

716
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:53,380
Although we immediately prepared ourselves

717
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,140
and we heard Strani's like, we're gonna hop and call.

718
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,060
And we were like, okay, start moaning.

719
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,020
Start doing stuff.

720
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,980
But I hope that gets clipped cause it would be so funny.

721
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:05,060
Um, yeah.

722
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,980
It was literally, but it's not even chat, GPT,

723
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,380
chat, GPT would not write something like that.

724
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,660
Chat, GPT would never write something like that.

725
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:13,500
I don't think.

726
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,780
But it was, yeah, it was so bad.

727
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:17,620
It was great.

728
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,580
I can imagine the script writer must have felt bad

729
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,740
about writing a lot of script

730
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,700
and so I had some meme humor in the parentheses

731
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,180
since narration isn't meant to be read out loud.

732
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:31,100
Yes, but even like, even with the dialogue

733
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:35,460
in the later scripts, it's not good.

734
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,940
And that was just the first script.

735
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:39,220
It gets progressively worse.

736
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,980
And we have more than one script writer.

737
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:49,180
So it's not like one person is writing 30 scripts a month.

738
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:55,100
It's like there's multiple people writing us scripts.

739
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,420
And then Strani will also like chime in

740
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,980
every once in a while as well.

741
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,300
As a lead translator myself,

742
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,900
these scripts were not something I never considered

743
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,220
except it will work for me.

744
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,940
Kind of, exactly.

745
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:12,940
It's like when I, one, they're doing a lot of like direction

746
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,980
and then like when I, I don't know,

747
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:18,820
maybe it's because like one of our other script writers

748
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:21,580
and Strani just writes differently when they give me scripts,

749
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:25,420
but they do a lot of like direction and what's going on.

750
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:27,900
They're doing a lot of saying and not,

751
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,500
or they're doing a lot of showing and not saying,

752
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,900
which is not what you do for an actual script.

753
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:35,380
At some point you should hold script writing competitions

754
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,100
and pick the best four for each month.

755
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,700
Oh, that'd be pretty cool.

756
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:41,180
For like maybe like a special month, we do that.

757
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,220
That'd be really nice.

758
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:43,300
That's a good idea.

759
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,700
Bring out with Strani.

760
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:45,540
She be a bridge.

761
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:48,140
That's literally, this is the month of October,

762
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,140
she be a bridge.

763
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,380
Big shout out to Smoothie for a good evening.

764
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,340
Big shout out to Smoothie for their viewer debut.

765
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,340
Oh, a hundred percent, yes.

766
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,500
Thank you so much to Smoothie

767
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,300
for doing a debut compilation of us.

768
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,300
I was like, holy crap, this is awesome.

769
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,140
It was so good.

770
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:05,980
I was laughing.

771
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,820
I'm like, I was so embarrassed.

772
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:10,340
The first opening line for the video

773
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:12,660
is welcome to be sucky fucky.

774
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,860
Well, where did you fucky?

775
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,540
You're sucking whatever the fuck I said.

776
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,500
I was like, oh my God.

777
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,020
Yeah, mommy's scripts are very, very good.

778
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,300
And I've also learned a lot

779
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,020
since I've started doing scripts,

780
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,060
like what you guys like, what you guys don't like

781
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,300
and like how you want me to read things.

782
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,260
I've also fixed my 3DO.

783
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:33,180
So it's, yeah, please watch Smoothie's video.

784
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:36,060
It was really, really funny

785
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,980
how he edited us all together.

786
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:47,980
But yeah, so, and I'm probably gonna hold

787
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:51,140
some sort of like script writing stream when I come back

788
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:54,300
because, and I've mentioned doing this before,

789
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,860
before I read the script, but I'm like, okay,

790
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,340
if this is the script that gets submitted,

791
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:00,140
I know I can write better than this.

792
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,620
Because like for example,

793
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:09,500
it's like everything's like, when like Shrani writes,

794
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,900
it's like everything's guided and like by word of mouth

795
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:16,500
and it's very, it's very like seductive and alluring.

796
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,860
And it's like, she's through the dialogue,

797
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,620
she's telling you what's happening.

798
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,900
But this person was mostly just writing direction

799
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,540
and it was very odd.

800
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:28,420
I'm like, we're not acting it out,

801
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,420
but I'm so sorry to the script writer if you're watching,

802
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:33,020
but that was very silly.

803
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:39,060
There were some very, very good things in there.

804
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,380
Hi, hi, hi.

805
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:45,620
But yeah, I wanted to like hop on and show you guys that,

806
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,620
but I can't wait for you guys to listen to the audio

807
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,420
that me and Amy just did together.

808
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,460
It was really nice.

809
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,900
You guys don't like it.

810
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:57,020
But yeah, it's inspired by a certain someone

811
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:01,860
who did a similar script in the past

812
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,500
that a lot of people enjoyed.

813
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,900
And so we wanted to do one ourselves.

814
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,380
Script writer, you cooked, but it was the wrong menu.

815
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:12,220
Honestly, facts, like the script is awesome,

816
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,300
but it's awesomely bad.

817
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,060
But it's like, you know, like it's like,

818
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:17,060
I'm trying to say this as nice as way possible.

819
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:20,020
Yeah, a certain someone.

820
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,460
Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.

821
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,980
Hello, hello.

822
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:27,660
Where is the audio gonna be uploaded?

823
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:30,500
I think she's uploading it to Twitter.

824
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,660
I think part one, there's two parts,

825
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:35,340
part one, I think will be on mine

826
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,100
and I think part two will be on mine,

827
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,660
either one, we each have a part.

828
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,460
Amy's a good script writer.

829
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,980
She's also a very good actress

830
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:48,220
because we were in call together, working out the script.

831
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:52,700
And so I had to sit there and listen to her, do her lines,

832
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,940
and I'm trying so hard not to laugh.

833
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:02,320
Yeah, it'll be a Twitter audio, I'm pretty sure.

834
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,720
Just so everybody can see it.

835
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,160
Yeah, it's a short thing.

836
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,260
It's not like 10 minutes long.

837
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:12,500
It's literally like two minutes, if not shorter than that.

838
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,680
Her audio with IC was base.

839
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,240
I heard it was, I heard it was really good.

840
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,640
You're gonna piss myself laughing.

841
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,480
I lost it, yeah.

842
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:23,480
Dude, I was literally losing it in the call with Emmy.

843
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,000
I'm like, Emmy, please look at this.

844
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,040
Please tell me I'm not going crazy.

845
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,960
And then I posted it and I was like, manager,

846
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,920
is this your fault?

847
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,040
And they were just like, why am I catching strays?

848
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,520
No.

849
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,440
And I'm like, I'm telling Strani.

850
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,320
And I'm like, Strani, please, please.

851
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,000
That's when I hopped around like Emmy, let's hop in the call.

852
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
And she's like, oh my God, but we were cackling so hard.

853
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:47,960
But now I know what you guys get for Emmy's audios.

854
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,480
She gave me a little taste and I'm like, okay.

855
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,560
All right, all right.

856
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,400
Oh my gosh, I can see.

857
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,280
Like, damn, my little sister's so talented.

858
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:04,120
And I'm like, how do I sound like that?

859
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,960
Like teach me your ways.

860
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,920
She does spoil you.

861
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,560
I was like, damn.

862
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,360
I was gripping my mouse, listening to her like, excuse me.

863
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,720
I want to be just like Emmy.

864
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,360
But it was, yeah, it was really fun to record.

865
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,800
And then now that I know that we both know

866
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,440
that we can record stuff in calls with each other,

867
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,880
we definitely want to get the other girls

868
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,360
to record stuff with us in calls

869
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,640
because it would just be so funny.

870
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,240
And then we can also give each other like tips and stuff.

871
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:36,840
And then like, yeah, I think it would just be great.

872
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,400
Nilsis, Emmy, Big Sis, Gibi, exactly.

873
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,840
But yeah, I'm sure, like the pin pals

874
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,360
are definitely gonna like it.

875
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,240
Harem is definitely gonna like it.

876
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:50,520
But yeah, the wholesome bonding, 100%.

877
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:53,720
Yeah, I like, I love spending time every time.

878
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,560
One of the girls left the call

879
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,280
when we were like all like kind of trickling off

880
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,160
to do our stuff that we had to get done,

881
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,360
whether it be like audios, scripts or whatever.

882
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,840
Smacked my hand on the table.

883
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,320
I'm like, like I see left.

884
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,040
I was like, I love that bear.

885
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,640
And Mercy left.

886
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,200
I'm like, I love that yandere.

887
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,840
Amy left.

888
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,880
I didn't say anything, but you guys know that I love her.

889
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,680
I love that little pumpkin girl,

890
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,360
that little hex maniac.

891
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,520
Anyone idea what's gonna drop?

892
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,360
Oh, I don't know.

893
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,920
Emmy has a lot of projects going on right now.

894
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,440
She's cooking up a bunch of stuff for you pin pals.

895
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:28,440
So just wait, don't worry.

896
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,960
But we both recorded it in like 10 minutes.

897
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,760
So it's really, she has to edit and stuff.

898
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,600
I asked her if she needed help.

899
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,720
She says, she's like, oh, I'm just gonna edit.

900
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,800
I'm like, okay.

901
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,560
I kind of want to teach her to teach me how to edit

902
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,400
and as well as Strani to teach me how to edit that stuff.

903
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,280
Cause usually I just like send it off to the audio editor

904
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,960
and then like insert all the like sound effects

905
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,800
and all that stuff.

906
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,360
It would be cool to like learn how to do that.

907
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,080
But yeah, it was, it was really fun and it was funny.

908
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,800
Like I would be using like my mommy voice.

909
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:00,400
I'd be like, come on little girl and be like, hey.

910
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,880
And she was like, it was really funny.

911
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,560
And then when she was making like her portion

912
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,760
that I'm not going to spoil.

913
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,360
I was like screaming internally.

914
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,640
So I hope you guys like it.

915
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,520
But yeah.

916
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,480
I hope you guys liked also the title of my stream,

917
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,240
something simple, something giggle stick.

918
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,200
I need to sneeze.

919
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:26,880
Thank you.

920
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,480
But yeah, it's really small and short,

921
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,800
but I think you guys will like it.

922
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,600
So short, sweet to the point.

923
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,640
Thank you, thank you.

924
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,920
But yeah, it means converting she be into someone.

925
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,720
I think honestly, I think, yeah.

926
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,880
I think I'm definitely being, I'm getting Emmy Pilled.

927
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,440
Can my allergies have been acting up like for the past few days?

928
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,240
I've been like sniffing a whole bunch.

929
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,240
But yeah, I hope you guys shibbling.

930
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:06,080
Don't get me started on the cotton bum family.

931
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,080
I literally just did that off the rip, by the way.

932
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:12,480
I don't even, I was possessed by some incestuous devil

933
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,320
to just do all that random ass lore.

934
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,520
I'm so sorry for some of you.

935
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,800
I thought it was funny as hell.

936
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,120
Based on yesterday's stream,

937
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,600
I think Emmy fully converted you already 100%.

938
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,520
Bro, imagine she being Emmy playing Kauffman,

939
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,360
Andy and Lillie.

940
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,200
That would be so funny.

941
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,280
If we did a collab stream playing Kauffman,

942
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,440
Andy and Lillie.

943
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:37,000
And like I voiced Andy and she voices Ashley.

944
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,080
I think that would be really, really funny

945
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,080
before building that day was wild it was.

946
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:44,560
But I just wanted to like do something kind of silly

947
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,120
and kind of like ridiculous.

948
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:50,360
Well, you guys literally watched me farm for four hours.

949
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:53,120
Honestly, I don't even remember farming.

950
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,720
I don't even, I generally don't even remember

951
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:55,560
what I was doing.

952
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:58,080
I just like shot a bird for four hours.

953
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,800
I got four million runes.

954
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,760
And yeah, and I just wanted you guys to laugh a bunch.

955
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,760
Don't lie, you've been playing this lore

956
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:07,840
since before your debut.

957
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,520
No, I usually actually was like never really

958
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,880
into that sort of stuff.

959
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,320
But like I get the allure.

960
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:15,320
Ha ha, ha ha, the V allure.

961
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,400
So I'm like, you know what?

962
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,480
Let me do a little treat for like the harem

963
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,760
cause usually you don't get that from me.

964
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,720
Let me do that.

965
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,680
And you guys know like I love being cute and funny sometimes.

966
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,040
Like it kind of like, I can like,

967
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,760
I feel like I show a different side of myself

968
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:31,680
when I get to be like shebethany and be cute and funny.

969
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,040
And then when I'm sheby, I can be like, you know,

970
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,040
my more like mommy adult self.

971
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,760
Oh, and you know, it's very, it's always fun.

972
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,040
I like, cause I, you guys know,

973
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,800
I used to be cute and funny on the daily.

974
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,680
So I'm at my PL.

975
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,680
So it's, I kind of miss that sometimes.

976
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:49,680
But I also just love being a big powerful woman

977
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,080
with drill hair.

978
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,680
Yeah.

979
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:53,920
I think you're always cute and funny.

980
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,520
Oh, thank you, so sweet.

981
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:01,320
But yeah, I think I'm, I mean, I see they've got me.

982
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:04,080
I'm like, oh man, I miss like that sort of stuff.

983
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,840
I miss being a princess.

984
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,040
And then Mercy makes me be like,

985
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,840
oh, I miss being kind of yandere.

986
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,760
But what I like about all of us is like,

987
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:14,400
we don't feel like we all can like do each other's niches.

988
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,120
Like, you know, like sometimes it means Dom,

989
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,760
sometimes Mercy's Dom, sometimes it means yandere.

990
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,800
Sometimes I see is like a little bit yandere.

991
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,080
Sometimes Azura is more Dom.

992
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:26,400
Like I remember Azura like said some like crazy stuff

993
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,680
on my stream that was like very Dommy

994
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:31,040
when during our collab stream with Emmy and Mercy.

995
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,480
And I was like, excuse me.

996
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,720
Sorry, I'm talking so fast, by the way.

997
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,200
I think I had caffeine.

998
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,360
So I'm like, I also feel really bad

999
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:42,200
because I feel like I talked a lot during the,

1000
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,040
let me slow down.

1001
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,160
Deep breath, sheepie.

1002
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:49,920
I feel like I talked a lot during the collab.

1003
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,680
So I'm sorry if I like talked over your Oshii

1004
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,400
or what, then I'm sorry.

1005
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,080
Don't hurt me.

1006
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:57,920
Yep, God.

1007
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:58,760
Kicking in.

1008
00:44:58,760 --> 00:44:59,600
Someone that will allow you,

1009
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,440
so it's not a human.

1010
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:01,280
I don't know guys, it's a human.

1011
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,120
I'm super human as well.

1012
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:04,800
I'm gonna get in, I'm gonna get in.

1013
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,920
All I see is the beginning of multiple personality disorder.

1014
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,560
It's gonna be great.

1015
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:11,720
Oh my God.

1016
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:14,440
Bunspeak, no, Bunspeak would be when I get a pyre.

1017
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:15,640
When I get a pyre, when I get like this,

1018
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:18,040
when I get Bunspeak, that's Bunspeak.

1019
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:21,000
That's when I get a mulliness and I sound really cute.

1020
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,560
What's next, loving girlfriend, Sheebie?

1021
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:26,760
You kind of already gotten that the past couple days.

1022
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,480
Oh my God, Eminem's a YouTuber now.

1023
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,240
Rap got Sheebie in the house, yeah.

1024
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,840
But yeah, you just carry the conversation.

1025
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,080
Yeah, sometimes I like,

1026
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:40,000
sometimes I have to tell myself if there's a silence,

1027
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,600
like I can be comfortable in the silence.

1028
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:44,000
Sometimes I feel like I need to fill a silence.

1029
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,120
Sheebie popping off today.

1030
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:50,800
I'm full of, I'm full of all the jokes, you know.

1031
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,640
Are you happy you're at 8K subscribers?

1032
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,440
Yes, it was such a pleasant surprise

1033
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:55,760
that I noticed that this morning,

1034
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,560
because only like yesterday or the day before,

1035
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:01,760
I was at 7.7, so that the clip,

1036
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:05,440
the debut stuff probably helped a lot in the collab stuff.

1037
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,200
So I'm glad that you guys like me and enjoy me.

1038
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:13,200
Like I said, and one of my goals was to get 10K subs,

1039
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:14,960
and I'm literally almost close to that,

1040
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,320
and it's surreal to me.

1041
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:20,320
Younger me would be confused, but proud

1042
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,560
of how I got 10K subs,

1043
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:25,480
because I've always wanted to be, you know,

1044
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,560
a YouTuber and stuff or a streamer,

1045
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:30,240
and my dreams are coming true.

1046
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,720
And I get to be a whore, like it's great.

1047
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:36,040
Affectionate, you know.

1048
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:38,640
But yeah, it'll be super cool.

1049
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,000
I'm trying to think of what to do for 10K.

1050
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,200
I think I was, I'm probably gonna do

1051
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:46,400
another hand cam for 10K.

1052
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:52,280
I was, or maybe like a hand cam ASMR,

1053
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,680
but that'd be cool.

1054
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,880
You guys can see the stupid shit that I do.

1055
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,640
But yeah, I prefer to give me ideas for 10K

1056
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:02,400
because I would love to celebrate that milestone with you,

1057
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,120
but I'm so very, very, very thankful for all of you.

1058
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:08,240
8K is a really big number to me,

1059
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:10,240
and I just can't wait.

1060
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,280
And it's funny, because like,

1061
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,600
Strawny's like, just you wait,

1062
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:16,400
just until you wait until I get you that 100K play button.

1063
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,640
And I'm like, oh, don't say that.

1064
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:21,960
Like, oh my God, like that just seems so surreal to me.

1065
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:24,600
And like, you're doing great, Shabrowski.

1066
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,040
You got to be a woe.

1067
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,000
What's a woe?

1068
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:30,800
Lovingly?

1069
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:31,640
Oh, a woe.

1070
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:32,480
Oh, I got you, me.

1071
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,240
Very funny.

1072
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:37,320
But yeah, and I'm proud of the other girls too.

1073
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,880
Like, I think Strawny is about to hit 10K

1074
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:41,160
or probably has hit 10K.

1075
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:44,360
I noticed it when me and Emmy were watching her stream

1076
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:48,600
and giggling like a bunch of maniacs that I was like,

1077
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:49,560
oh, she's at 9.9.

1078
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:51,560
So like, Strawny's about to hit 10K.

1079
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:53,640
Emmy is past 10K.

1080
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:55,800
Icy finally hit 10K, 6K.

1081
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:58,400
And I'm like, we're all growing at a steady pace.

1082
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,840
And I'm so proud of all of us in the hard work

1083
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:02,120
that we're all putting in.

1084
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:03,360
It really shows.

1085
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,520
And then again, the algorithm works in mysterious ways.

1086
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:10,640
So sometimes like, one of us lag behind,

1087
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,040
but we like make sure we lift each other up

1088
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:15,640
because like, I'll say it like, Corpo Unity,

1089
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:16,720
like we are unified.

1090
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,640
Like we want to support everyone.

1091
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,520
Strawny at 9.9, 4K.

1092
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,000
Oh, see, like very close.

1093
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,240
Like she'll probably hit 10K by the end of the night

1094
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,800
or like tomorrow.

1095
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,080
So I'm just really happy.

1096
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,320
I'm happy that Strawny's dream is coming true.

1097
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:36,320
She's giving us a platform to lift up smaller creators up.

1098
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:40,080
They usually wouldn't have certain opportunities

1099
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:42,440
and they're happening and it's great.

1100
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:44,520
Like she was telling us about other opportunities

1101
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:45,880
we might be able to have in the future.

1102
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:48,200
And I literally was like, what?

1103
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,240
Like we could have that.

1104
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,560
We could get this.

1105
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,880
Like, are you kidding me right now?

1106
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:55,120
Like what?

1107
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:58,640
Yeah, I'm so thankful for the girls.

1108
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,400
I'm so thankful for them.

1109
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,360
They're so wonderful.

1110
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:05,960
I was literally in college before everybody left.

1111
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:08,920
And I was like, can I just say, I love you all.

1112
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:11,440
And Mercy's just like, I love you too.

1113
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:14,320
And one, Mercy's a very lovey person.

1114
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,160
Oh my gosh.

1115
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,360
I walked away to use the bathroom,

1116
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,080
but I still had my headphones on.

1117
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:21,600
And it was, and then I think like Amy and Strawny

1118
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:24,360
also like stepped away to like get tea and stuff and water.

1119
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:30,040
And I'm like just like sitting on the toilet

1120
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:32,920
using the bathroom with my headphones on.

1121
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:36,080
And I just hear Mercy talking to Icy.

1122
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:39,240
And she's just like, hi, Icy.

1123
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:42,240
And Icy's like, hi.

1124
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:46,120
And then she's just like, I love you, Icy.

1125
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:49,000
And Icy's like, I love you too.

1126
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,840
And I'm just like laughing on the toilet

1127
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:53,880
because they're so fucking cute guys.

1128
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:55,280
I swear to God.

1129
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:00,520
But yes, like we all very much love each other.

1130
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:02,560
We're all very supportive of each other.

1131
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:03,400
And it's really cool.

1132
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,440
Like I was, I liked talking, cause I was talking to Amy.

1133
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,440
I'm like, oh, what'd you got going on?

1134
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,200
Like what do you want to, like projects you want to do?

1135
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,200
She was telling me and I'm like, aw, sick.

1136
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,840
And I love the opportunity.

1137
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:17,000
Like I always look forward to all of our collabs and stuff

1138
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,960
because I just, we're usually busy with our own like streams

1139
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,000
or like working on stuff.

1140
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,480
So it kind of stinks when we can't like sit

1141
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,880
and talk with each other.

1142
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:27,720
And I was kind of bummed

1143
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,800
cause like I know Azura had to stream afterwards.

1144
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:32,400
And I was like, I wanted to hang out with Azura too.

1145
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,160
I miss Azura.

1146
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,160
I miss Azura.

1147
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,320
I'm going to hang out with her

1148
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,320
and have her just make funny noises on call.

1149
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:41,240
Cause that's what she does.

1150
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,600
She just giggles and cackles and just goes,

1151
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:45,600
she's like, a little maniacal.

1152
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:46,600
I love her for that.

1153
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:51,480
Yeah, we got to hang out a lot, lots today.

1154
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:52,600
And it was really awesome.

1155
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,440
It was really great.

1156
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:55,280
I can't wait.

1157
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,120
We get to hang out.

1158
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:59,360
Well, technically we don't get to hang out tomorrow, sad.

1159
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:02,240
Cause we have the watch along, but like,

1160
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,360
I kind of want to like be in call with them.

1161
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:06,440
I'm going to ask actually, can we all be in call together

1162
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:07,280
and we do the watch alongs

1163
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,280
and I'll react at the same time.

1164
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,280
I think we are going to do that.

1165
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,200
I don't know.

1166
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,880
At last, cause that would be great.

1167
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,760
I'm still in call.

1168
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:17,600
Whoops.

1169
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:22,480
Let me just, I forgot I was still in call.

1170
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,880
Any one of them could have walked in and been like, hey.

1171
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,000
Oh.

1172
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,000
Yeah, we're already like trying to make plans

1173
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,600
to like see each other and stuff.

1174
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:36,120
A monthly Jen collab.

1175
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:36,960
Yeah.

1176
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:37,800
We try for, we aim for that.

1177
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:41,000
We try to aim for a month and then we might do

1178
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,280
of like all of us.

1179
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:44,400
And then like sometimes like, like me and Mercy

1180
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,080
just like kind of just like jumped in call together.

1181
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:48,880
Like we had a collab with other girls from mythos,

1182
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,600
but then we kind of hung out with each other.

1183
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:52,920
And then I did the same thing with Amy today.

1184
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:54,960
And like, I want to do that with Icy.

1185
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:55,800
And I want to do that.

1186
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:58,320
And I've done, I want to do that with Azura and Strani.

1187
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,920
Like I haven't even gotten into a collab with Strani yet.

1188
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,720
Like what the hell?

1189
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:05,400
But we all like definitely, like I'll just like wake up

1190
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,480
and look at our Discord chat.

1191
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,640
And yeah, Mercy collab's happening next week.

1192
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:10,480
Yes, yes, yes.

1193
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:11,680
We're playing Super Bunny Man.

1194
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:18,040
I look at my, the Discord general for our company.

1195
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:19,840
And it's just a bunch of us.

1196
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,120
We're all just like, I love you.

1197
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:21,960
I miss you.

1198
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:22,800
We're gonna hang out.

1199
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:23,640
I miss you guys.

1200
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:24,600
What are you guys doing today?

1201
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:25,440
What's going on?

1202
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,920
Oh, that's really tasty food you posted.

1203
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:27,760
Oh my God.

1204
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:28,600
Your cat's so cute.

1205
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,040
Like it's, it's great.

1206
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:31,480
We need the viewer house to be real.

1207
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:32,960
Imagine that would be so fun.

1208
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,600
Oh my God.

1209
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:35,360
Yeah.

1210
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:39,800
It's just like, it's really nice to be a part of something.

1211
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,920
And I didn't realize how much I wanted that.

1212
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:46,920
Cause like I went into a company wanting to grow as a creator.

1213
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:50,640
And I know, like I work well with others,

1214
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:54,760
but I didn't know I would be so devoted and dedicated

1215
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:56,520
to all the other girls.

1216
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:59,680
I was just like, okay, am I gonna see them as coworkers?

1217
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,240
And I'm like, no, I don't see them as coworkers.

1218
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:03,080
I see them as very close friends.

1219
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,600
Um, I know I'm bad when it comes to watching streams

1220
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,440
of all kinds of everyone,

1221
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:08,880
but generally I hope you all continue to grow and be happy.

1222
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,080
I think we will.

1223
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:11,200
And it's like, it's okay.

1224
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,760
You don't have to like, you do what you can.

1225
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,520
And we appreciate that.

1226
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,320
We appreciate all of that.

1227
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:19,600
How much do we need to donate to get the viewer house

1228
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:20,440
to become real?

1229
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,840
I think it would be way too much.

1230
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:26,120
Viewer house turned into a battlefield by the pets.

1231
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,080
Yeah, that's a good point.

1232
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:28,000
We all have pets.

1233
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,280
That'd be bad.

1234
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,600
My cats would probably eat in these rats.

1235
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:34,600
How are you doing?

1236
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,280
I'm glad I can see my favorite bunny waifu.

1237
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:38,000
Oh, thank you.

1238
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,360
Hello, I'm doing really great.

1239
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:40,840
I got to hang out with cute girls today

1240
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:42,720
and I got to look at really awesome designs.

1241
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,240
I really wish we could have done more.

1242
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:47,840
Yeah, it does feel great to feel like you belong somewhere.

1243
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:51,560
I've never like felt more meant to do something,

1244
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:52,680
to be honest with you.

1245
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:55,600
Like I am like, I am supposed to be here.

1246
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,480
I belong here.

1247
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:01,200
And like, I remember like hoping to the freaking universe

1248
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:05,240
I got into Veealer and because I'm like,

1249
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,640
I know I'm meant to be here.

1250
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:09,680
And that's why I recorded my audition video

1251
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,760
three days before auditions opened.

1252
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,880
And I thought of all the possible questions

1253
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:15,560
they may ask in the form so I could prepare

1254
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:17,480
and send it in as fast as possible.

1255
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:19,040
And that's why I was the first one

1256
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,080
to submit my audition to the Veealer.

1257
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:26,280
Veealer at her, so I need soundproofing in every room.

1258
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:27,440
You're so right though.

1259
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,880
Like all of us fucking just moaning.

1260
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,120
Hi, she being fellow harem.

1261
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:32,400
Hello.

1262
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,080
I do really hope you all get many,

1263
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,560
many years of streaming and growing.

1264
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:36,400
Me too.

1265
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:37,840
Like I am only thinking like,

1266
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,960
this is only like the second month guys.

1267
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:41,640
Like we're halfway through the second month

1268
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:46,240
and I can't believe how much has happened and changed.

1269
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,360
And it's all thanks to you guys.

1270
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:50,160
Like what the heck?

1271
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,240
My God.

1272
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:55,160
But do you also belong to the October series?

1273
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,000
No.

1274
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:58,840
Oh.

1275
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:02,120
Hi, hi, everybody coming in.

1276
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:04,400
I was never into VTubers much

1277
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,120
until I saw all of your debuts last month.

1278
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:07,640
But now I'm glad I came and stayed.

1279
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,800
I've had more laughs recently than I had in a while.

1280
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:12,560
I'm so glad that all we want to do is make you laugh

1281
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:13,400
and coom.

1282
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,280
I love you and all of you are giggle sticks.

1283
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:17,560
I think if I ever,

1284
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:19,720
I think I'm gonna call it that from now on.

1285
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:24,360
No, wait, no, but I really like the idea of Bible.

1286
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:27,440
But giggle sticks is funny too.

1287
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,640
I just think it's so funny.

1288
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:30,960
That that happened.

1289
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,640
Hold on, let me see.

1290
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:33,480
Oopsies.

1291
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:35,400
I didn't mean to go into the freaking,

1292
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,200
I didn't mean to join another call.

1293
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:45,040
Oh, my manager sent me my thumbnails for the month

1294
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:46,400
and I'm like awkward

1295
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,840
because we're doing a Twilight watch along next week.

1296
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:54,040
And it's funny because it's just like me as like Bella

1297
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,880
next to day, next to Edward.

1298
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:59,880
Oh, so funny.

1299
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:03,520
Well, as Vod say, oh, the Vod staying up.

1300
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,800
I was kind of like talking to Emmy

1301
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,400
and Emmy was kind of explaining to me

1302
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,560
how like Vod limited stuff works

1303
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:10,720
and she was kind of like showing me.

1304
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,760
And I'm like, it's not,

1305
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:15,960
as long as I don't get a strike, I think it's fine.

1306
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,880
So I'm like, you know what, it's funny.

1307
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,280
It's hilarious.

1308
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,360
I'm leaving it up.

1309
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:23,720
I'm glad you found something that was meant for you.

1310
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:24,680
I know what I'm after.

1311
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:25,720
There's some obstacles in between.

1312
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:27,160
And for that, I hope to find something that clicks

1313
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:28,240
like you did with the other.

1314
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,440
Yeah, like it took some effort to get here.

1315
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:33,480
Like I had to stream, I had to prove my worth.

1316
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:37,400
You don't like, some companies will say like,

1317
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,480
oh, you don't need any prior streaming service,

1318
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:42,080
like experience, but you really do.

1319
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:44,960
And so it is really recommended.

1320
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,920
If you want to become a VTuber

1321
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:48,760
and you want to join a company,

1322
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:50,080
please stream for a little bit

1323
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:52,600
because you might find out you don't like it

1324
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,280
or it might not fit into your schedule

1325
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:55,520
or it's not the type of lifestyle.

1326
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:59,360
You might not be used to the hate or the positivity.

1327
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:02,920
Like, you know, oh, thank you, Paul for the 10 gifted.

1328
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:03,760
Thank you.

1329
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:04,600
What the heck?

1330
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:09,200
My gosh, I'll forgive the Bible.

1331
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,520
The script master should release a new

1332
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:11,920
English translation of the Bible.

1333
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,000
I agree with that.

1334
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:13,840
Thank you so much.

1335
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:14,880
You're so sweet.

1336
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,240
Team Edward or Team Jacob?

1337
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,040
Team Jacob.

1338
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:21,080
Team Jacob.

1339
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:25,280
Celebratory pod keeping gifts.

1340
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:30,360
Oh, mad I'm putting in that work in a show.

1341
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:31,320
It deserves success.

1342
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:32,160
Thank you.

1343
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,000
Thank you.

1344
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,960
And I'm happy you guys are enjoying the work that I put in.

1345
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:38,160
Should be the trolley deserve better into, oh, 100%.

1346
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:39,240
Trolley deserve way better.

1347
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:40,760
Are you kidding me?

1348
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:42,640
I would hate my child if my child was, you know,

1349
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,160
whatever that happened.

1350
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,640
All that jazz.

1351
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:48,840
What's a giggle stick?

1352
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:51,960
I want you to look down in between your legs.

1353
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:56,000
Um, and yet I guess, oh no.

1354
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,360
We got touched again, bro.

1355
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:03,960
Oh, we all know why Team Jacob don't look at me like that.

1356
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:07,160
Shibi, can I ask the reason for why we can't give

1357
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:08,680
the full memberships to the girls

1358
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:10,520
and instead only the emotes here?

1359
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:13,640
I, to be honest with you, again,

1360
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:15,960
I'm not super familiar with YouTube,

1361
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:20,960
but I think the idea is that only really dedicated people

1362
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:28,920
will want to spend time with you in the membership streams

1363
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,880
and they're the ones who watch all your streams

1364
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:31,800
and know what you're about.

1365
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:34,760
If kind of like anybody went into a membership stream

1366
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:36,400
and they're kind of like, I don't know, like normie,

1367
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,280
then they might like kind of be off put,

1368
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:40,760
but like for example, like my tag stream,

1369
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:44,360
a lot of people were thrown off by that.

1370
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:47,440
And oh my God, no, it is still got missed, bro.

1371
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:50,480
Thank you for the other.

1372
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,200
Oh my God, what?

1373
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:57,000
Thank you for the other 20 and another 20 by 30 to you, Paul.

1374
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,840
Oh my God.

1375
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:01,320
All right, here are my little PogChamp.

1376
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:04,200
Shibi likes furries.

1377
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:05,040
No, I don't.

1378
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:08,720
Damn.

1379
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:12,320
But I think, yeah, it basically makes it

1380
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:14,760
so you do have to spend at least some money to attend.

1381
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:16,040
Gifts still give you a nice discount.

1382
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:18,920
Yeah, like you just pay the remainder.

1383
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:21,960
But yeah.

1384
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:23,800
Oh my God, why are you guys so nice today?

1385
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:28,800
Thank you for the 10 gifts, what the hell, guys?

1386
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:32,320
Oh, they're like really trying to help that bro out.

1387
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:34,080
I want to see, did he get it?

1388
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:35,360
Oh my God, he did it!

1389
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:42,080
Bro, your settings must be off.

1390
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:44,560
There can be no way.

1391
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:46,920
There can be no way, you must have settings off

1392
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:49,240
so you can't get this gifted.

1393
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:53,200
Dodged.

1394
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:55,480
Just a running gag.

1395
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:58,800
There's always one person that just misses it.

1396
00:59:58,800 --> 00:59:59,640
Where's mine?

1397
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:01,320
You have one, it's right there.

1398
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:06,920
Oh, you guys are so nice.

1399
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:09,400
You're like, let's get all green in here.

1400
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:10,240
Or is a brand account?

1401
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,520
That's a good point, it could be a brand account.

1402
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:16,280
She be punishing me lovingly, thank you.

1403
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:19,920
Punch the mic, punch the mic, punch the mic, punch the mic.

1404
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,920
I think that's gonna be a bit now.

1405
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:22,760
Sorry.

1406
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:25,960
See, I'm punishing you lovingly.

1407
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:28,160
That's loving, me punching you.

1408
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,520
One day it'll work, what's a brand account?

1409
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:31,360
I don't...

1410
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:36,040
All right, round three.

1411
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:37,840
Third time's a charm, thank you Paul.

1412
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:46,080
I wanna see, I wanna see, is it gonna work?

1413
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:47,560
Come on, speak.

1414
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:53,840
The punches of love, oh no.

1415
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:58,840
No, no, oh brother.

1416
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:04,640
It's so shib over.

1417
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:06,920
You probably only have to worry about the brand account thing

1418
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:09,880
if your account is really old, that's a good point.

1419
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:12,760
Okay guys, stop for real.

1420
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:14,480
You gotta need to calm down.

1421
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:20,400
Someone just paypal my bro like five bucks

1422
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:21,600
and call it a day.

1423
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:24,520
I'm getting soaked, oh.

1424
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:28,480
Punch the mic, punch the mic, punch the mic.

1425
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:29,320
No.

1426
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:32,480
Oh my.

1427
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:37,440
It doesn't end, okay.

1428
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:39,840
You poor thing.

1429
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:42,840
All right, chat, I'm taking you close to my chest.

1430
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:46,800
I love you guys so much.

1431
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:49,600
It's got you, your luck is just not good.

1432
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:55,600
As I'm giving you a kiss, mwah, mwah.

1433
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:58,000
Oh my god, okay.

1434
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,720
Is this a game to you guys?

1435
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:00,560
Oh my god.

1436
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:01,520
Mwah.

1437
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:09,200
Guys, guys, calm, the ward is, did he get it?

1438
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:13,280
No, he still did.

1439
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:17,480
Guys, this is, stop, stop, stop, stop.

1440
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:19,640
The gacha needs to end, guys, stop.

1441
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:21,240
Thank you, thank you.

1442
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:22,920
On a gorilla stream.

1443
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,240
Oh my god, thank you, hold on.

1444
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:27,200
Let me say thank you.

1445
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:29,120
Thank you, viewer lover.

1446
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:31,160
Thank you, dragon and Dante.

1447
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:34,320
And Dante, dragon and Dante.

1448
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,560
Thank you, Paul, again.

1449
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:37,000
Thank you, Joker.

1450
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,360
Thank you, average amphibian.

1451
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:39,640
You're not average.

1452
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:40,600
You're great.

1453
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:41,920
Thank you, Ken, at 30.

1454
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:45,840
Oh my god.

1455
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:49,000
You could be a lucky recipient

1456
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,040
of a Shippee-Kan-Wambiola membership.

1457
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:54,620
Oh my goodness.

1458
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:58,080
Oh my god.

1459
01:02:58,080 --> 01:02:59,480
Thank you, Usmami.

1460
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,040
Next one.

1461
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,960
Next one, did he get it?

1462
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:09,400
Did he, no, no.

1463
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:11,520
No.

1464
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:15,920
I think it's an ultra rare, apparently I'm not eligible.

1465
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:18,080
Okay, that explains a lot then.

1466
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:22,040
Oh no, oh guys, see that's why I told you to stop

1467
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:25,080
because I'm like, there's probably something else going on.

1468
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:27,720
That's preventing him from getting one.

1469
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:29,760
He must have a brand account then.

1470
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:33,200
Oh, it was rigged from the start, guys.

1471
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:36,040
No, you tried.

1472
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:37,840
Thank you for the gifted.

1473
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:40,840
That's why I was like, stop, stop.

1474
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:41,680
Oh.

1475
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:47,400
But congrats to everybody else who got gifted stuff

1476
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:48,640
and now you can have my emotes.

1477
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:51,580
My other emotes should be done at some point very soon.

1478
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:55,320
Oh, the brand account debuff is real.

1479
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:57,160
Thank you again, Joker.

1480
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:59,160
You guys are absurd.

1481
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:01,320
I guess this is like, you guys paying me

1482
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:04,160
for the silly script that I read for you.

1483
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:05,920
I'll have to split these with Emmy.

1484
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:10,280
I'll be like, throw some money at her.

1485
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:13,160
Just be like, there's your cut.

1486
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:18,880
Yeah, you'd have to make a whole new account.

1487
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:20,520
I don't care if I'm actually not eligible.

1488
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:24,040
Oh, but you should probably get that checked out, bro.

1489
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:26,500
And you get access to member streams, yes.

1490
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:30,520
And then I have an archive karaoke

1491
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:35,400
and when I come back from my vacation,

1492
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:37,360
from the 18th to the 23rd,

1493
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:41,200
and then we have a watch along on Monday.

1494
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:42,040
What's the day?

1495
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:42,880
Today's Saturday.

1496
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:47,960
I have to go to my parents' house tomorrow.

1497
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:49,000
So I get a suitcase,

1498
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,800
because I forgot I don't have a suitcase.

1499
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:54,000
Ooh, I got a sub, but doesn't tell me from who.

1500
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,440
Yeah, say, make sure you say thank you.

1501
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:56,840
Say thank you.

1502
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,960
Thank you, everybody.

1503
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:03,880
You will be green in madam's presence.

1504
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:06,520
I was like, next time drinking is right.

1505
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:08,040
Like if you don't, yeah, they're just emotes.

1506
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:10,960
If you want to get an actual, you have to upgrade.

1507
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:13,280
Oh my God.

1508
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:14,440
Sorry, it's your favorite character.

1509
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:15,920
My cat's food going off.

1510
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:19,840
The gray harlot is still valid.

1511
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:21,200
You're still appreciated and loved.

1512
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:22,720
You still show up to my streams.

1513
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:23,960
I still appreciate you.

1514
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,560
As well as the Lurkers.

1515
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:32,280
But yeah, we did a really fun tag list.

1516
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:34,080
We watched Sucker Punch the other day.

1517
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:35,360
It was really fun.

1518
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:39,120
Yeah, so it's only a couple bucks.

1519
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:41,360
I feel like I'm like shilling myself.

1520
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:44,720
Check out my Patreon in the description below.

1521
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:47,120
Check out Emmys' Patreon in the description below.

1522
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:48,720
We'll actually go to her.

1523
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:50,120
I don't think I have her Patreon

1524
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:51,720
or any of the other girls' Patreon.

1525
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,400
Um, go to her channel.

1526
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:56,520
Stop to her Patreon.

1527
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:58,000
That's all I'm gonna say.

1528
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,160
I was once a gray harlot too, long time ago.

1529
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:05,360
You were like, they were gray like five minutes ago.

1530
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:08,000
My cats are eating.

1531
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:09,840
Alphia is eating.

1532
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:11,400
Hi, Pia.

1533
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:12,560
Raina is asleep.

1534
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:15,080
Raina is knocked out on the chair.

1535
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:16,160
Raina, are you good?

1536
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:18,720
Raina.

1537
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:21,920
Raina, what are you doing?

1538
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:23,000
Oh, you're licking your paws.

1539
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:23,840
Okay, sorry.

1540
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:26,480
And Boomi is knocked out on the cat tree.

1541
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:27,320
He has passed out.

1542
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:28,240
My little handsome man.

1543
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:29,680
All his paws are all together.

1544
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:30,520
He's very cute.

1545
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:33,640
Just checking you're still streaming longer.

1546
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:37,480
I don't know.

1547
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:38,600
I was just talking.

1548
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:41,280
I guess I'll stream longer.

1549
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:42,200
It's only the least I can do

1550
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:44,000
after getting a bazillion freaking gifted.

1551
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:44,840
So yeah.

1552
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:47,120
Where's Yappin?

1553
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:48,320
Where Yappin?

1554
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:50,800
You remember dogs and lizards over cats or reptiles?

1555
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:51,640
Do I redirect her to you?

1556
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:53,840
Yes, mom, you can.

1557
01:06:56,560 --> 01:06:59,480
Strani, I definitely recommend that you watch this VOD,

1558
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:00,320
by the way.

1559
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:06,320
At least like the first like 30 minutes to an hour

1560
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:07,680
or like go through it

1561
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:09,920
because you'll laugh because of me

1562
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,760
and Amy did something funny.

1563
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:12,600
Amy was on my stream.

1564
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:15,600
Oh, thank you for the gift and Mr. Black's silence.

1565
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:18,360
I've gifted Mr. Black's silence.

1566
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:20,800
26, whose name makes me crack up every time I see it.

1567
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:24,800
Well, I leave for 10 minutes and so many gifted.

1568
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:26,000
Yeah.

1569
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,800
People were trying to hit this one dude

1570
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:30,920
with a gifted membership, but he moans

1571
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:33,840
and then I think he just doesn't, he's a brand account.

1572
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:34,680
Oh my God.

1573
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:37,800
Very silly.

1574
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:39,560
Okay, where is,

1575
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:40,840
I feel like I need to make myself a little bit bigger.

1576
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:42,200
I'm a little bit far away.

1577
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:44,160
Let me get up close and personal.

1578
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:46,920
With y'all.

1579
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:48,400
Hi, welcome to my room.

1580
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:51,800
Yes, I wear a sign on my shirt because YouTube hates me.

1581
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:53,760
You know what? It's coming off.

1582
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:56,440
A limiter coming off.

1583
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:02,440
Everybody gets to see.

1584
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:05,320
I'm not ashamed of myself anymore.

1585
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:09,920
I am here to stay.

1586
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:13,640
Imagine if I was flat, Tristan.

1587
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:14,720
That'd just be weird.

1588
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:20,160
But what if the justice,

1589
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:21,960
I forgot to put my ooo-oo mouth on.

1590
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:25,920
Wait, where'd my track go?

1591
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:27,720
I want to see what you guys are saying.

1592
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:30,960
She be on these.

1593
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:33,720
YouTube hates body positivity.

1594
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:37,280
I know, imagine my video just like disappears.

1595
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:39,620
Cutting bird.

1596
01:08:39,620 --> 01:08:41,120
Well, I could take them off.

1597
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:44,720
Actually, let me see if I can do that.

1598
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:48,160
I think I could take them off.

1599
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:49,560
Can I take them off my boobs?

1600
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:53,160
I feel like this is a bad idea for me to try,

1601
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:54,560
just like I did when I accidentally was changing

1602
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:56,320
my skin color on stream.

1603
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:59,000
Let's not do that.

1604
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,360
Let's not do that.

1605
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:06,960
I would, so I wouldn't remove that.

1606
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:11,200
Like I wouldn't, it just,

1607
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:13,040
I would just make myself transparent.

1608
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:14,080
They would just be transparent.

1609
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:16,120
So you guys would be able to see through me.

1610
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,400
Shawty, Mama Raid.

1611
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:21,800
Hello.

1612
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:24,240
I hope you have your giggle sticks ready.

1613
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:26,720
Cause we're about to shlorp, shlorp.

1614
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:27,560
I'm sorry.

1615
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:32,600
Oh my God, my headphones are dying.

1616
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:34,040
Hi, writers.

1617
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:37,560
Hello, Raiders.

1618
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:39,000
Welcome in.

1619
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:43,160
I have no idea where you guys are up through this stream.

1620
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:45,000
You'll laugh really hard, mom.

1621
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:47,680
You'll laugh really hard, Shawty.

1622
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:49,640
If you watched like the first hour of it,

1623
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:50,960
or a little bit less.

1624
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:53,320
Is this the R greeting session?

1625
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:58,560
We might have read the first script

1626
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:01,920
and heavily censored it because of how silly it was.

1627
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:04,360
Herm.

1628
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:05,240
Did she win?

1629
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:06,840
Was she winning?

1630
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:08,440
Was she winning, Riftlands?

1631
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:09,960
Did she win Baltaro?

1632
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:12,480
Baltaro?

1633
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:13,720
Was she winning?

1634
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:15,400
Strony equals Shibi's top?

1635
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:16,240
What?

1636
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:18,680
I don't know.

1637
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:20,160
Honestly, I don't know the power dynamic

1638
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:21,520
between me and Strony.

1639
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:24,120
Oh my God, here we go again.

1640
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:27,160
Thank you a third of the time he gifted.

1641
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:28,800
Jesus Christ.

1642
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,560
He did so great.

1643
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:31,400
I'm glad.

1644
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:34,560
Remember to like and subscribe.

1645
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:36,680
Have all three flinks to support Shibi.

1646
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:38,280
Oh yeah, like and subscribe.

1647
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:39,600
Also send that love over to Amy

1648
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:41,640
cause she was on over here as well.

1649
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:43,880
Don't forget to like, comment and subscribe.

1650
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:46,880
On any of our VODs and streams,

1651
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:50,760
just like at Strony's.

1652
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:54,320
I can't even talk because people won't stop gifting.

1653
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,880
Guys, relax.

1654
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:01,920
Thank you to X2Doki for the 10 gifted.

1655
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,320
My God.

1656
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:06,240
The gotcha must flow.

1657
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:07,680
It's literally like just like pull

1658
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:08,520
and hope that you win.

1659
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:09,360
Oh my.

1660
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:13,560
Thank you for the 20 gifted Paul, but yeah.

1661
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:14,880
Oh my God.

1662
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:18,640
I'm so good at dodging.

1663
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:19,640
You're good at dodging too.

1664
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:21,520
Everybody's dodging.

1665
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:23,000
Everybody's taught like all my Lakers

1666
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,760
are poking popping up like did I win?

1667
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,560
Hopefully.

1668
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:31,360
Guys, at this rate, I'm going to literally

1669
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:36,400
have only greenies.

1670
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:38,120
No harlot left behind.

1671
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:41,240
Yeah, everybody should be able to use the emotes.

1672
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:44,640
Oh, you guys are so sweet.

1673
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:46,440
I'm pretty sure I can get gifted membership.

1674
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:47,520
It's just my luck, I guess.

1675
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:50,240
It is very, very odd.

1676
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:52,800
You know what?

1677
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,640
I honestly don't care about getting a membership.

1678
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:57,440
I'm just happy to support a Vtuber I like watching.

1679
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:00,920
I don't even need a Vtuber.

1680
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:03,480
Whatever guys, I don't need a membership from you guys.

1681
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:04,320
Whatever.

1682
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:08,480
No, but you're right.

1683
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:11,000
I still appreciate you even if your name is gray,

1684
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,160
even if you're a Laker,

1685
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:15,080
as long as you watch and support me and the girls,

1686
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:16,800
that's all that really matters.

1687
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:17,800
Thank you.

1688
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:21,040
Thank you, Average and Phibian.

1689
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:23,080
Is this going to be a stream of me just saying thank you

1690
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:24,240
for all the gifted?

1691
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:27,280
Thank you, Average and Phibian for the 10 gifted.

1692
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:29,120
Believe me more.

1693
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:32,920
Plop, plop, plop, good gifted, good gifted, good gifted.

1694
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:35,760
Sundare Chat, Sundare Streamer, it works.

1695
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:39,520
Maybe I don't want a cool sticker.

1696
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:41,400
Maybe I don't want a cool sticker.

1697
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:43,040
Maybe I just want to be plain.

1698
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:47,280
If it is when I'm out of here,

1699
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:48,120
what do you mean?

1700
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:48,960
Where are you going?

1701
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:49,920
Get the fuck back here.

1702
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:51,520
You don't get to leave.

1703
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:52,720
You thought you could leave.

1704
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:55,000
You thought you could leave.

1705
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:55,840
You don't get to go.

1706
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:57,320
Oh, wait, guys, I've,

1707
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:58,920
since there's a lot of you here.

1708
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:05,920
Jay Santorillo.

1709
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:12,920
Hey, welcome to the members, the members here.

1710
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:18,920
Do you like my reverb?

1711
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:24,920
Should we, should we start singing songs?

1712
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:30,920
Hold on.

1713
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:31,920
Where's my,

1714
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:33,920
can I put on the cute and funny?

1715
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:36,920
Hi, everybody.

1716
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:39,920
It's me, British Stevie, once more.

1717
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:40,920
Hello.

1718
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:44,920
Thank you so much for all of the gifted subs.

1719
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:46,920
You are also very sweet.

1720
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:48,920
I appreciate you so much.

1721
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:52,920
You've been reverbed.

1722
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:55,920
Get reverbed, get reverbed, get reverbed.

1723
01:13:56,920 --> 01:13:58,920
As long as you don't start singing

1724
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:01,920
the Darren Waller classic Cook On Shibs.

1725
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:04,920
Oh, I'm Jeet Shibathani.

1726
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:05,920
Hi, yes.

1727
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:07,920
I'm Shibathani's British sister.

1728
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:10,920
I'm not the older one that's in Britain.

1729
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:12,920
I'm the younger one that's in Britain.

1730
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:14,920
The older one sounds like this.

1731
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:16,920
She talks like this.

1732
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:20,920
Yeah.

1733
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:21,920
Well, go on, Solar.

1734
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:23,920
I never stopped working.

1735
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:24,920
Let's see.

1736
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:25,920
Let me think of a song to sing.

1737
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:27,920
I need to put in my right headphones for this

1738
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:29,920
because I'm using my different headphones.

1739
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:32,920
I need to put in my IEMs for this.

1740
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:36,920
Doing your shit, Britannia.

1741
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:40,920
Oh, my God.

1742
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:42,920
This fucking echo.

1743
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:44,920
Echo, echo.

1744
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:50,920
Sing me a song.

1745
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:51,920
Wait, what's that song?

1746
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:53,920
Let me take the echo down.

1747
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:55,920
What's the viewer about?

1748
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:58,920
Oh, Misty.

1749
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:00,920
Whoa, my voice cracked.

1750
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:10,920
How I just hurt my mouth.

1751
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:13,920
It's like bumped my straw against my gum.

1752
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:14,920
Ow.

1753
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:16,920
Hi, Boomi.

1754
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:18,920
Oh, thank you for that.

1755
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:21,920
I was just a gifted because I'm so used to saying gifted.

1756
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:23,920
The gifted, the gifted.

1757
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:26,920
Boomi, why are you going in the box?

1758
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:28,920
A viewer lover.

1759
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:29,920
Thank you for the $5.

1760
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:32,920
Dr. P, thank you for the 10 gift.

1761
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:33,920
Guys.

1762
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:37,920
You're absolutely fucking going bonkers right now.

1763
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:40,920
How I'm the grafted.

1764
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:46,920
Oh, my God.

1765
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:47,920
It will never stop.

1766
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:50,920
It's just going to be a constant stream.

1767
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:52,920
Get spoiled.

1768
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:53,920
Get spoiled.

1769
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:55,920
God, I don't deserve this.

1770
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:56,920
I don't deserve this.

1771
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:57,920
Stop it.

1772
01:15:57,920 --> 01:15:58,920
Okay.

1773
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:00,920
This song.

1774
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:01,920
Hold on.

1775
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:03,920
I need to look at the lyrics.

1776
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:04,920
It goes out to Strawny.

1777
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:05,920
I want to do this.

1778
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:09,920
I want to, uh, I want to clap on this song with her.

1779
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:19,920
I'm not going to put the music because then everything will just get claimed.

1780
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:27,920
Oh, misty high up the mountain below.

1781
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:29,920
Keep careful.

1782
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:33,920
Watch off my brother's soul.

1783
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:41,920
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke.

1784
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:46,920
Keep watching over do more in the sun.

1785
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:57,920
If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together.

1786
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:03,920
Watch the flames cry high into the night.

1787
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:06,920
Calling out father home.

1788
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:15,920
Stand by and we will watch the flames burn hot burn on the mountain side.

1789
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:21,920
I can't sing that well.

1790
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:23,920
I'm sorry.

1791
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:24,920
Strawny did it.

1792
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:26,920
Wait, I wasn't looking at my chat.

1793
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:27,920
I was looking at the lyrics.

1794
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:29,920
Did Strawny just give fire?

1795
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:32,920
Why did you give fire?

1796
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:40,920
Thank you, Strawny.

1797
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:42,920
Oh my God.

1798
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:43,920
Oh my God.

1799
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:44,920
Oh my God.

1800
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:46,920
I'm living in a freaking cry at this rate.

1801
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:50,920
So you guys are too good to me.

1802
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:53,920
Strawny, do you want to collab with me on this song?

1803
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:57,920
I think we could do a really good job.

1804
01:17:57,920 --> 01:18:00,920
And then later she's like, that'll be coming out of your paycheck.

1805
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:03,920
No kidding.

1806
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:08,920
This really is a member song.

1807
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:09,920
I can't sing.

1808
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:11,920
RIP broke my vocal cords.

1809
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:13,920
We can like throw some auto tune on it.

1810
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:15,920
Honestly, I love your memer song.

1811
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:17,920
I'm just a memer.

1812
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:20,920
Oh my God.

1813
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:23,920
Thank you, Mr. Black.

1814
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:25,920
I love fire.

1815
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:28,920
I imagine, because you mentioned when you get rated,

1816
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:35,920
I'm like minus $25 for kids.

1817
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:37,920
Oh my goodness.

1818
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:39,920
Yeah, that doesn't mean you can't.

1819
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:40,920
It doesn't mean you shouldn't.

1820
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:43,920
Exactly.

1821
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:48,920
I just love Ed Sheeran's voice in that.

1822
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:50,920
Waiting for the one person to drop 50 gifted.

1823
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:52,920
No.

1824
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:55,920
Stop it.

1825
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:59,920
Get your hand away from that freaking button.

1826
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:00,920
She does have a good voice.

1827
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:03,920
I don't know what she's talking about.

1828
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:05,920
Stop it.

1829
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:06,920
Get some help.

1830
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:08,920
Okay.

1831
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:11,920
I'm not going to sing the whole song.

1832
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:13,920
That's a little test.

1833
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:16,920
Don't tempt fate.

1834
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:18,920
Are the gifted part of my allowance?

1835
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:19,920
Yes.

1836
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:20,920
Sing yellow.

1837
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:21,920
Oh, I like yellow.

1838
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:22,920
Yeah.

1839
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:25,920
And it was all yellow.

1840
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:27,920
Yellow.

1841
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:32,920
But I can't play.

1842
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:35,920
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

1843
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:38,920
It's a little bit too much.

1844
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:42,920
I go more reverbs so I sound more ethical.

1845
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:45,920
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

1846
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:46,920
Okay, sorry.

1847
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:48,920
Whoa.

1848
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:52,920
Oh, I knocked something over my desk.

1849
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:56,920
Look at the stars.

1850
01:19:56,920 --> 01:20:00,920
Look at the skies.

1851
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:07,320
I'll put some autotune on and see if that helps me a little bit usually the autotune just actually makes my stuff worse

1852
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:13,040
That's me see I

1853
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:22,280

I don't know what to say

1872
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:09,040
Here's fake money

1873
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:17,600
Oh my god, it began as a joke now it's a mission

1874
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:28,560
You know, yeah, you better give this energy to the girls as well you better

1875

There's too many slices

1878
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:10,000
You better give the same fucking energy to the other girls. I swear to god you better

1879
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:18,480
I forgot it was on

1880
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:21,760
You know what I noticed my tears don't run down my face anymore

1881
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:25,760
But honestly, it feels kind of funny. I remember seeing a tweet of someone saying

1882
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:31,920
It feels weird crying on stream and then putting on my crying toggle. I feel like I'm recording myself for a TikTok

1883
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:38,160
Oh

1884
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:41,120
Her new horse affection it could be so wholesome

1885

01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:10,400
Everybody's gonna have emotes and I can't wait when I get more emotes because I can probably get more emotes now

1890
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:21,760

Again if you're gonna call me a bitch you better put sensitive in front of it

1893
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:35,600

Because I'm your stripper

1908
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:55,040
And I'm gonna do what a stripper does and sing which strippers don't sing but it's fine. It's just for the bit

I need the I definitely need the auto tune for this you need the auto tune

1910
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:16,800
Okay, um, I'm debating whether or not just to make this like a mini karaoke

01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:23,120
Um, I don't know where did wait, where did my chat go?

01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:20,800
Yeah, so professional streamer sets up their mic

2129
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:25,200
All right, are you guys ready to party? Oh ignore that

2130
01:45:26,080 --> 01:45:27,520
uh

2131
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:32,800
I'm about to belt. I think everybody's probably outside on their balcony is watching the um

2132
01:45:33,840 --> 01:45:36,160
Fireworks, I don't have to worry about that. How are my cats doing?

2133
01:45:37,120 --> 01:45:39,600
Hold on. Let me go check on my cats. I don't want them to be scared

2134
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:44,800
Okay, Rena's good

2135
01:45:58,240 --> 01:46:00,240
Everybody

2136
01:46:07,120 --> 01:46:11,520
All right, they're actually doing okay, and I'm doing better than I thought this is their fourth first fourth of july

2137
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:14,960
So I just want to make sure that they're good. Well, it's not for the July anymore, but you guys get it

2138
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:17,120
okay

2139
01:46:17,120 --> 01:46:19,120
cats going um

2140
01:46:19,120 --> 01:46:24,400
My fire alarm used to go off a lot because my neighbors were stupid and they would accidentally set off the fire alarm

2141
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:29,280
And I'm building and so the cats are very scared of all loud noises now, which makes me very sad

2142
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:35,600
Again, I also apologize that you can hear the fireworks in the background

2143
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:39,520
All right, are you ready?

2144
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:45,600
We don't need to hear the part

2145
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:47,600
Oh

2146
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:57,520
Wait, I was like it was like just beeped randomly

2147
01:47:00,400 --> 01:47:05,200
Na na na come on na na na na come on

2148
01:47:07,120 --> 01:47:11,600
Na na na na na come on come on come on come on

2149
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:13,840

Na na na na come on

2153
01:47:24,640 --> 01:47:26,640
I don't know. There's so many na na na's of the song

2154
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,720
Come on. Come on. Na na na na

2155
01:47:31,680 --> 01:47:33,680
Feel so good being bad

2156
01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:37,440
There's no way I'm turning back

2157
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:42,880
Now the plane is my pleasure because nothing could measure

2158
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:46,400
Oh

2159
01:47:46,640 --> 01:47:48,640
Love is great. Love is fine

2160
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:52,400
Out of the box out of line

2161
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:57,680
The affliction of feeling leaves me wanting more

2162
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:06,080
Because I might be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it's sex in the air

2163
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:13,440
I don't care. I love the smell of the sticks and stones may make my bones my chains and whips

2164
01:48:14,160 --> 01:48:20,960
Excite me. Oh my god. I might be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it's sex in the air

2165
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:23,520

Out of the box out of line

2172
01:48:54,240 --> 01:48:57,920
The affliction of the feeling leaves me wanting any to take a drink

2173
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:02,800
I have autotune on I'm not hitting the notes

2174
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:09,440
Perfectly good at it's sex in the air. I don't care. I love the smell. This is what I sound like without autotune

01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:06,880
Leading you down into my core

2208
01:52:07,760 --> 01:52:10,720
Where I've become so numb

2209
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:14,960
Without a soul

2210
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:26,640
My spirit sleeping somewhere cold until you find it there

2211
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:30,320
Back

01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:32,560

2271
01:57:42,640 --> 01:57:44,640
Hey, I'm math and a little we don't care

2272
01:57:45,440 --> 01:57:47,920
Shut up. Male discussing

2273
01:57:52,880 --> 01:57:54,880
Yeah, boomies boomies chillin

2274
01:58:02,080 --> 01:58:04,080
That's a weird thing to say

2275
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:23,120
Do you ever feel like a plastic bag drifting through the wind wanting to start again

2276
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:30,880
Do you ever feel feel so paper thin like a house of cards when blown from caving in

2277
01:58:31,600 --> 01:58:38,640
Do you ever feel already buried deep six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing

2278
01:58:38,880 --> 01:58:40,880
Oh, yeah, I forgot my phone

2279
01:58:40,960 --> 01:58:42,960
There's still a chance for you

2280
01:58:43,520 --> 01:58:46,800
It's working here. You just gotta ignite

2281
01:58:49,440 --> 01:58:52,080
I'm not hold on. I need to start over when we just hopped on my desk again

2282
01:58:53,760 --> 01:58:56,960
Hold on. I'm gonna do better. Hold on. I promise you. I'm better. I'm better than this

2283
01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:00,800
The voice crack though

2284
01:59:01,040 --> 01:59:03,040
You just gotta ignite

2285
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
Oh

2286
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
They let it shine

2287
01:59:09,680 --> 01:59:12,160
Just on the night

2288
01:59:13,280 --> 01:59:16,160
Like the fourth of july

2289
01:59:16,800 --> 01:59:20,160
Cause baby you're a firework

2290
01:59:20,800 --> 01:59:22,800
Come on show him why

2291
01:59:23,280 --> 01:59:24,720
You're worth

2292
01:59:24,720 --> 01:59:26,720
Make him go ha ha ha

2293
01:59:28,080 --> 01:59:30,080
As you shoot across the sky

2294
01:59:32,560 --> 01:59:35,760
Baby you're a firework

2295
01:59:36,320 --> 01:59:39,600
Come on let your colors burst

2296
01:59:40,240 --> 01:59:42,240
Make him go ha ha ha

2297
01:59:43,520 --> 01:59:46,720
You're gonna leave him all in ha ha ha

2298
01:59:48,720 --> 01:59:51,920
Your singing is too good for autotune. I know the autotune is not working properly

2299
01:59:53,200 --> 01:59:55,200
It's not gonna be too good though

2300
01:59:55,200 --> 02:00:00,560
Cannot be replaced if you only knew what the future holds

2301
02:00:01,040 --> 02:00:03,840
After her dream comes around. Oh my god, boonie, please

2302
02:00:04,800 --> 02:00:06,800
He keeps hopping on my desk

2303
02:00:09,440 --> 02:00:11,680
Over the leaves you to the perfect room

2304
02:00:12,640 --> 02:00:14,640
Like the lightning bolt

2305
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:16,560
Your heart will grow

2306
02:00:16,560 --> 02:00:20,240
And when it's I turn off autotune, you'll know you just gotta ignite

2307
02:00:21,280 --> 02:00:23,280
The light

2308
02:00:23,280 --> 02:00:25,760
It let it shine

2309
02:00:27,120 --> 02:00:29,680
Just on the night

2310
02:00:30,720 --> 02:00:33,680
Like the fourth of july

2311
02:00:34,080 --> 02:00:37,680
Cause baby you're a firework

2312
02:00:38,240 --> 02:00:40,640
Come on show him why

2313

Make him go ha ha ha

02:00:49,840 --> 02:00:53,040
Baby you're a firework

2317
02:00:53,680 --> 02:00:57,040

You're gonna leave him all in ha ha

2320
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:05,840

2321
02:01:08,720 --> 02:01:12,320
Even brighter than the moon moon moon moon

Baby you're a firework

2331
02:01:39,920 --> 02:01:43,760

02:07:19,280 --> 02:07:21,280
With reverb

2454
02:07:21,280 --> 02:07:23,280
Ow that hurt my ears

2455
02:07:23,280 --> 02:07:25,280
Ow that hurt my ears

2456
02:07:25,280 --> 02:07:27,280

02:07:31,280 --> 02:07:33,280
Ow that does not sound good

2460
02:07:33,280 --> 02:07:35,280
I don't like that at all

2461
02:07:35,280 --> 02:07:37,280
I almost tased myself

2462
02:07:37,280 --> 02:07:39,280
That's awkward

2463
02:07:39,280 --> 02:07:41,280
Anyways don't worry about that

2464
02:07:41,280 --> 02:07:43,280
We're fine

2465
02:07:43,280 --> 02:07:45,280
My neighbors are running by

2466
02:07:45,280 --> 02:07:47,280
With their little loud children

2467
02:07:47,280 --> 02:07:49,280
E E electric shock

2468
02:07:49,280 --> 02:07:51,280

A lot of students laser

2471
02:07:55,280 --> 02:07:57,280
Oh it's just reverb right now and a little bit of echo

2472
02:07:57,280 --> 02:07:59,280
Echo echo

2473
02:07:59,280 --> 02:08:01,280

02:08:07,280 --> 02:08:09,280
shock collar

2478
02:08:09,280 --> 02:08:11,280
Maybe I'll use my shock collar for 10k

2479
02:08:11,280 --> 02:08:13,280
Subs

2480
02:08:13,280 --> 02:08:15,280

Hold on let me get some more water

2482
02:08:17,280 --> 02:08:19,280

2487
02:08:29,280 --> 02:08:31,280
I'm taking my salt water

2488
02:08:31,280 --> 02:08:33,280
You don't have to run over here

2489
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:35,280
It's not fine for treats, ma'am

2490
02:08:35,280 --> 02:08:37,280

Woogie woogie woogie

2496
02:08:53,280 --> 02:08:55,280

02:08:55,280 --> 02:08:57,280
It's electric

2498
02:08:57,280 --> 02:08:59,280
Woogie woogie

2499
02:08:59,280 --> 02:09:01,280

Probably better doing that one

2510
02:09:25,280 --> 02:09:27,280

Oh

2608
02:14:17,280 --> 02:14:22,260

Oregon tipped $13.37.

2610

Thank you, Morgan.

2611
02:14:25,760 --> 02:14:28,200
This stream is the happiest I've been in months.

2612
02:14:28,200 --> 02:14:29,200
Oh, I'm so glad.

2613
02:14:29,200 --> 02:14:31,560
You're existing and sharing a part of yourself with us.

2614
02:14:31,560 --> 02:14:32,240
Of course.

2615
02:14:32,240 --> 02:14:34,160
I also really want to give you a hug

2616
02:14:34,160 --> 02:14:39,000
to show you how much I appreciate this for being you.

2617
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
Thank you, Morgan.

2618
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,640
I'm going to cry if you hug me, I'll cry.

2619
02:14:44,640 --> 02:14:46,120
Yay.

2620
02:14:46,120 --> 02:14:47,600

You guys give me lots of love.

2623
02:14:50,120 --> 02:14:52,760
I'll do a little bit of rap for you.

2624
02:14:52,760 --> 02:14:57,120
So we'll do, because I like to rap, I'm going to do gorillas.

2625
02:14:57,120 --> 02:14:58,400
Feel good.

2626
02:14:58,400 --> 02:15:01,640
No, Clint Eastwood, sorry.

2627
02:15:01,640 --> 02:15:05,880
Because I actually, actually know the rap for Clint Eastwood.

2628
02:15:05,880 --> 02:15:07,480
Let's see, let's see, let's see.

2629
02:15:08,480 --> 02:15:14,960
I like how this is turned into just like a pseudo karaoke.

2630
02:15:14,960 --> 02:15:16,200
Wait, hold on.

2631
02:15:16,200 --> 02:15:17,720
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

2632
02:15:17,720 --> 02:15:21,880
You know what I should do to make this ambiance a little bit

2633
02:15:21,880 --> 02:15:22,720
better?

2634
02:15:22,720 --> 02:15:24,280
Yeah, now, halt on.

2635
02:15:24,280 --> 02:15:25,640
I got you.

2636
02:15:25,640 --> 02:15:28,440
I got you so, so good.

2637
02:15:28,440 --> 02:15:29,320
Did it do good, wait.

2638
02:15:33,880 --> 02:15:34,880
Let's see.

2639
02:15:38,480 --> 02:15:44,480
I don't have like woosh or whatever or shoest, but this is fine, right?

2640
02:16:05,480 --> 02:16:06,480
What?

2641
02:16:06,480 --> 02:16:08,480
You have a small peepee?

2642
02:16:08,480 --> 02:16:09,480
I can't believe it.

2643
02:16:09,480 --> 02:16:10,480
No, I'm kidding.

2644
02:16:10,480 --> 02:16:11,480
I love that effect.

2645
02:16:11,480 --> 02:16:12,480
It's so funny.

2646
02:16:12,480 --> 02:16:14,480
OK, that's fine.

2647
02:16:14,480 --> 02:16:17,480
Let me do a little bit of lighting.

2648
02:16:23,480 --> 02:16:24,480
Oh, hi, Rena.

2649
02:16:30,480 --> 02:16:33,480
You're going to set the mood, yeah.

2650
02:16:37,480 --> 02:16:40,480
Oh, I'm big.

2651
02:16:40,480 --> 02:16:44,480
I'm trying to scroll through the chat.

2652
02:16:44,480 --> 02:16:48,480
MSI, maybe MIT MSI.

2653
02:16:48,480 --> 02:16:49,480
I killed it.

2654
02:16:49,480 --> 02:16:50,480
Thank you.

2655
02:16:50,480 --> 02:16:51,480
Dare.

2656
02:16:51,480 --> 02:16:52,480
I do love dare.

2657
02:16:52,480 --> 02:16:53,480
It's coming out.

2658
02:16:53,480 --> 02:16:54,480
It's coming out.

2659
02:16:54,480 --> 02:16:55,480
It's that.

2660
02:16:55,480 --> 02:16:56,480
Oh.

2661
02:16:56,480 --> 02:17:00,480
You've got to press it on you.

2662
02:17:00,480 --> 02:17:05,480
You just think that's why you do, baby.

2663
02:17:06,480 --> 02:17:08,480
Hold it down there.

2664
02:17:11,480 --> 02:17:12,480
Ignore that side.

2665
02:17:12,480 --> 02:17:13,480
It's fine.

2666
02:17:14,480 --> 02:17:15,480
Now it's better.

2667
02:17:16,480 --> 02:17:18,480
I wish I could darken my room.

2668
02:17:19,480 --> 02:17:20,480
Can I?

2669
02:17:20,480 --> 02:17:22,480
I don't think I can.

2670
02:17:22,480 --> 02:17:23,480
Filters.

2671
02:17:24,480 --> 02:17:25,480
Change of fact.

2672
02:17:27,480 --> 02:17:28,480
Color correction.

2673
02:17:29,480 --> 02:17:30,480
Color correction.

2674
02:17:30,480 --> 02:17:31,480
Opacity black.

2675
02:17:32,480 --> 02:17:33,480
Close.

2676
02:17:33,480 --> 02:17:35,480
Yeah, baby.

2677
02:17:39,480 --> 02:17:40,480
Oh, yeah.

2678
02:17:40,480 --> 02:17:42,480
That can actually be really funny.

2679
02:17:42,480 --> 02:17:44,480
To recreate the dare music video.

2680
02:17:44,480 --> 02:17:45,480
That's actually good.

2681
02:17:45,480 --> 02:17:47,480
I used to drive from the boys.

2682
02:17:47,480 --> 02:17:51,480
I don't think I could do that glamorous or furky, perhaps.

2683
02:17:53,480 --> 02:17:54,480
Listen to the single.

2684
02:17:54,480 --> 02:17:55,480
Listen to the music.

2685
02:17:55,480 --> 02:17:56,480
Sing with me.

2686
02:17:56,480 --> 02:17:58,480
Oh, I love that.

2687
02:17:58,480 --> 02:17:59,480
All right.

2688
02:17:59,480 --> 02:18:00,480
All right.

2689
02:18:00,480 --> 02:18:01,480
I'm sorry guys.

2690
02:18:01,480 --> 02:18:05,480
I won't be able to do all the suggestions, but I'm trying to get through a lot of them

2691
02:18:05,480 --> 02:18:07,480
because you guys have a lot of good ones.

2692
02:18:13,480 --> 02:18:15,480
It's getting way closer to technique.

2693
02:18:25,480 --> 02:18:26,480
That was weird.

2694
02:18:26,480 --> 02:18:27,480
Sorry.

2695
02:18:27,480 --> 02:18:28,480
The way it started like, hold on.

2696
02:18:28,480 --> 02:18:29,480
I think we'll laugh.

2697
02:18:33,480 --> 02:18:34,480
All right.

2698
02:18:34,480 --> 02:18:35,480
Hold on.

2699
02:18:41,480 --> 02:18:42,480
Feel good.

2700
02:18:44,480 --> 02:18:45,480
Feel good.

2701
02:18:47,480 --> 02:18:48,480
I know this is feel good.

2702
02:18:48,480 --> 02:18:49,480
I want to clean Eastwood.

2703
02:18:49,480 --> 02:18:50,480
What am I doing?

2704
02:18:51,480 --> 02:18:52,480
That's better.

2705
02:18:54,480 --> 02:18:55,480
I was like, wait a second.

2706
02:18:59,480 --> 02:19:03,480
Oh, I ain't happy.

2707
02:19:03,480 --> 02:19:08,480
I'm feeling glad I got sunshine in a bag.

2708
02:19:08,480 --> 02:19:11,480
I'm useless, but not for long.

2709
02:19:11,480 --> 02:19:13,480
The future is coming on.

2710
02:19:13,480 --> 02:19:15,480
I ain't happy.

2711
02:19:15,480 --> 02:19:19,480
I'm feeling glad I got sunshine in a bag.

2712
02:19:19,480 --> 02:19:22,480
I'm useless, but not for long.

2713
02:19:22,480 --> 02:19:25,480
The future is coming on.

2714
02:19:25,480 --> 02:19:26,480
It's coming on.

2715
02:19:26,480 --> 02:19:27,480
It's coming on.

2716
02:19:27,480 --> 02:19:28,480
It's coming on.

2717
02:19:28,480 --> 02:19:29,480
It's coming on.

2718
02:19:29,480 --> 02:19:30,480
It's coming on.

2719
02:19:30,480 --> 02:19:33,480
Finally, someone let me out of my cage.

2720
02:19:33,480 --> 02:19:36,480
Now, time is for me for nothing because I'm counting no age.

2721
02:19:36,480 --> 02:19:37,480
Now, I couldn't be there.

2722
02:19:37,480 --> 02:19:39,480
No, you shouldn't be scared.

2723
02:19:39,480 --> 02:19:43,480
I am good at repairs and I'm under each snare, each tangible.

2724
02:19:43,480 --> 02:19:44,480
But you didn't think so.

2725
02:19:44,480 --> 02:19:46,480
I command you to panoramic you.

2726
02:19:46,480 --> 02:19:48,480
Look, I'll make it all manageable.

2727
02:19:48,480 --> 02:19:51,480
Pick and choose, sit and lose all your different crews.

2728
02:19:51,480 --> 02:19:54,480
Chicks and dudes who you think is really kicking tunes.

2729
02:19:54,480 --> 02:19:57,480
Picture you getting down in a picture tube.

2730
02:19:57,480 --> 02:19:58,480
Like you lift the fuse.

2731
02:19:58,480 --> 02:20:01,480
You think it's fictional, mystical, maybe.

2732
02:20:01,480 --> 02:20:05,480
Spiritual, hero who appears in you to clear your view when you're too crazy.

2733
02:20:05,480 --> 02:20:09,480
Lifeless, but to those who definition for life is priceless to you

2734
02:20:09,480 --> 02:20:12,480
because I put you on the hype shit you like it.

2735
02:20:12,480 --> 02:20:14,480
Done smoking righteous with one token.

2736
02:20:14,480 --> 02:20:17,480
Psychic among those possess you with one dose.

2737
02:20:19,480 --> 02:20:20,480
Breathe.

2738
02:20:22,480 --> 02:20:25,480
Useless, but not for long.

2739
02:20:25,480 --> 02:20:27,480
The future is coming on.

2740
02:20:27,480 --> 02:20:29,480
I ain't happy.

2741
02:20:29,480 --> 02:20:33,480
I'm feeling glad I got harem in a bag.

2742
02:20:33,480 --> 02:20:36,480
I'm useless, but not for long.

2743
02:20:36,480 --> 02:20:39,480
The future is coming on.

2744
02:20:39,480 --> 02:20:40,480
Is coming on.

2745
02:20:40,480 --> 02:20:41,480
Is coming on.

2746
02:20:41,480 --> 02:20:42,480
Is coming on.

2747
02:20:42,480 --> 02:20:43,480
Is coming on.

2748
02:20:43,480 --> 02:20:44,480
Is coming on.

2749
02:20:44,480 --> 02:20:45,480
Is coming on.

2750
02:20:45,480 --> 02:20:46,480
The essence, the basics.

2751
02:20:46,480 --> 02:20:47,480
Without it, you make it.

2752
02:20:47,480 --> 02:20:51,480
Allow me to make this childlike in nature rhythm.

2753
02:20:51,480 --> 02:20:52,480
You have it or you don't.

2754
02:20:52,480 --> 02:20:53,480
That's a fallacy.

2755
02:20:53,480 --> 02:20:54,480
I'm in them.

2756
02:20:54,480 --> 02:20:55,480
Every sprout and tree.

2757
02:20:55,480 --> 02:20:56,480
Every child piece.

2758
02:20:56,480 --> 02:20:57,480
Every cloud and sea.

2759
02:20:57,480 --> 02:20:58,480
You see with your eyes.

2760
02:20:58,480 --> 02:21:00,480
I see destruction and demise.

2761
02:21:00,480 --> 02:21:03,480
Corruption and disguise from this fucking enterprise.

2762
02:21:03,480 --> 02:21:04,480
I'm sucked into your lies.

2763
02:21:04,480 --> 02:21:08,480
We wrestle not as muscles, but percussion he provides for me as a guy.

2764
02:21:08,480 --> 02:21:11,480
Y'all can see me now because you don't see with your eye.

2765
02:21:11,480 --> 02:21:13,480
You perceive with your mind.

2766
02:21:13,480 --> 02:21:14,480
That's the inner.

2767
02:21:14,480 --> 02:21:17,480
So I'm a stick around with Russ and be a mentor.

2768
02:21:17,480 --> 02:21:18,480
That's a few rhymes.

2769
02:21:18,480 --> 02:21:21,480
So motherfuckers remember what the thought is.

2770
02:21:21,480 --> 02:21:25,480
I brought all this so you can survive when law is lawless.

2771
02:21:25,480 --> 02:21:28,480
Feeling sensations that you thought was dead.

2772
02:21:28,480 --> 02:21:29,480
No squealing.

2773
02:21:29,480 --> 02:21:31,480
Remember that's all in your head.

2774
02:21:31,480 --> 02:21:32,480
I ain't happy.

2775
02:21:32,480 --> 02:21:36,480
I'm feeling glad I got sunshine in a bag.

2776
02:21:36,480 --> 02:21:39,480
I'm useless, but not for long.

2777
02:21:39,480 --> 02:21:42,480
My future is coming on.

2778
02:21:42,480 --> 02:21:44,480
I ain't happy.

2779
02:21:44,480 --> 02:21:48,480
Feeling glad I got sunshine in a bag.

2780
02:21:48,480 --> 02:21:51,480
I'm useless, but not for long.

2781
02:21:51,480 --> 02:21:53,480
My future is coming on.

2782
02:21:53,480 --> 02:21:55,480
It's coming on.

2783
02:21:55,480 --> 02:21:57,480
It's coming on.

2784
02:21:57,480 --> 02:21:59,480
It's coming on.

2785
02:21:59,480 --> 02:22:02,480
My future is coming on.

2786
02:22:02,480 --> 02:22:04,480
It's coming on.

2787
02:22:04,480 --> 02:22:06,480
It's coming on.

3151
03:02:23,520 --> 03:02:27,920

3184
03:06:08,800 --> 03:06:13,840
flying can be scary it's not i'm not worried about like flying it's like it's like moving

3185
03:06:13,840 --> 03:06:21,840
through an airport that i haven't been to in a very very long time um it's like it's all the

3186
03:06:21,840 --> 03:06:27,040
unknown like i know on a plane like i'm just on a plane that's fine i'm fine i'm fine flying but

3187
03:06:27,040 --> 03:06:35,600
like traveling by myself is scary especially as a girl um but yeah you guys over skipping bible

3188
03:06:35,600 --> 03:06:41,680
study for bible study being a makeup guinea pig is basically much okay so nothing will be changed

3189
03:06:41,680 --> 03:06:48,720
for you then yeah you know touching the bible when i'm gone by the way you cannot speak to the lord

3190
03:06:48,720 --> 03:06:54,480

3281
03:16:51,040 --> 03:16:55,040
the compilation of all your girls debuses hilarious i saw you shared it on twitter yeah

3282
03:16:55,040 --> 03:17:01,040
it's really awesome it's really funny we have we had so much fun with our debus we're all so nervous

3283
03:17:01,680 --> 03:17:06,240
we're like oh what if people don't like us but it's like i'm so thankful for the um

3284
03:17:07,360 --> 03:17:12,560
the type of reception that we've gotten it's really nice it's hotter with the purr sorry i

3285
03:17:12,560 --> 03:17:19,520
said my desk reina what's up mama come on she's like purring so hard on my shoulder

3286
03:17:19,680 --> 03:17:26,960
all right have a good night we get to hear burps and she's feeling i know sometimes

3287
03:17:26,960 --> 03:17:31,760
i used to give them out willy nilly but now i'm like you know what i'm too nice let me withhold

3288
03:17:31,760 --> 03:17:38,480
my burps because you know i'm running an establishment as madame of wonderland a

3289
03:17:38,480 --> 03:17:43,280
hotel that also doubles as a brothel don't tell anybody and i'm the madame of that establishment

3290
03:17:44,240 --> 03:17:50,880
uh it's only fair that a woman of my caliber upholds her professionalism while streaming to the masses

3291
03:17:50,880 --> 03:17:58,400
you know my favorite moment of view was when you had three heads on top of one in your chest

3292
03:17:58,960 --> 03:18:00,480
yeah be not afraid

3293
03:18:04,560 --> 03:18:10,320
so now we're kidding her reina makes you think of a gender swapped reign from the owl house

3294
03:18:10,320 --> 03:18:11,920
i never watched owl house as a kid

3295
03:18:19,280 --> 03:18:24,640
boomy king of umashu and he was another one of my cats he was in my desk with his paws crossed

3296
03:18:24,640 --> 03:18:30,000
like a gentleman i don't know where fia the deathbed companion who's my other cat her name is actually

3297
03:18:30,000 --> 03:18:33,920
fia the deathbed companion by the way because i love elden ring that much i think she's sleeping

3298
03:18:33,920 --> 03:18:40,640
under my bed boomy why are you just like laying his head in my hand

3299
03:18:49,760 --> 03:18:53,360
you're mad though because i touched his shoulder he only likes his head pat and now he's grooming

3300
03:18:53,360 --> 03:18:57,600
himself named us another cat d that would be so funny

3301
03:18:58,320 --> 03:19:05,280
what's a game that all the six dealer girls want to collab together one day well we wanted to do

3302
03:19:05,280 --> 03:19:12,000
power wash simulator but it didn't work out it like the for someone reason it just wasn't working

3303
03:19:12,000 --> 03:19:15,920
it like it would crash when there was four of us in there and you can have up to six people it was

3304
03:19:15,920 --> 03:19:23,280
really weird so i would like to play power wash simulator and i oh my god in the worst way i want

3305
03:19:23,280 --> 03:19:30,960
to play prop hunt and gary's mod i i have like over just like i have over 600 hours in counter

3306
03:19:30,960 --> 03:19:37,600
strike and i have over 600 hours in gary's mod because all i would do was play trouble in terraced

3307
03:19:37,600 --> 03:19:45,600
town in prop hunt and it was so great also uno yes i want to play uno i love if we had to play

3308
03:19:45,680 --> 03:19:51,760
like prop hunt with the you may plus girls or like with my thos it would be so funny so funny

3309
03:19:54,400 --> 03:19:59,680
so i'm trying to convince the girls to buy um very small it's only like five bucks or

3310
03:19:59,680 --> 03:20:03,360
i think might have been on five bucks for the steam sale but i think that's over so might be nine again

3311
03:20:04,000 --> 03:20:04,480
for ten

3312
03:20:07,840 --> 03:20:15,200
and i'm a i'm a prop hunt veteran so gonna go yes go to sleep go to sleep thank you so much

3313
03:20:15,200 --> 03:20:19,600
for your support and thank you for the song suggestions thank you gt you three different

3314
03:20:19,600 --> 03:20:24,320
youtuber agencies would be cool crazy it really would though it really would

3315
03:20:26,800 --> 03:20:29,840
you don't need counter strike source for some apps yeah that's true i forgot sometimes you

3316
03:20:29,840 --> 03:20:34,720
did desource for some of the maps nowadays i think you can just like download most of them out

3317
03:20:34,720 --> 03:20:42,160
mod packs oh my god i probably just do like the minecraft map one of my faves or office

3318
03:20:42,160 --> 03:20:47,920
i clocked seven forty five hours just messing with friends playing so they capture the classic

3319
03:20:47,920 --> 03:20:54,480
games you see plus mine so that strani would probably like thrive in that game she would i

3320
03:20:54,480 --> 03:20:59,920
think she would like it a lot i just i would love hearing her scream when she get discovered she'd

3321
03:20:59,920 --> 03:21:06,000
be like all right three flings i don't think they all fucking shit now they spotted me and then

3322
03:21:06,000 --> 03:21:12,000
she just fucking runs off i think it'd be so so funny

3323
03:21:15,040 --> 03:21:18,320
counter strike source is defensive or some random stuff but it happened or not that's

3324
03:21:18,320 --> 03:21:24,960
true honestly i'll buy it for everyone i literally i just don't give a shit be like here we go the

3325
03:21:24,960 --> 03:21:33,760
masses want gary's mod the masses will get gary's mod i can already hear mercy screaming whether

3326
03:21:33,760 --> 03:21:42,080
she's the hunter being hunted guys and then when she's chasing one of us to be like i can't do her

3327
03:21:42,080 --> 03:21:46,720
wait let me think of her laugh can't do her laugh that well

3328
03:21:51,280 --> 03:21:54,160
and then she'd laugh and like shoot us explode us

3329
03:21:54,640 --> 03:22:04,560
okay hey do do your part tell the other girls hey you guys should play this game because get

3330
03:22:04,560 --> 03:22:09,760
those suggestions out there if you watch the other girls and i hope you do give them their suggestions

3331
03:22:10,480 --> 03:22:16,080
tell them what's up i guess strani do impressions she does too many of them well

3332
03:22:16,800 --> 03:22:25,520
strani does really funny american accents i think i remember she was like trying to be southern

3333
03:22:25,520 --> 03:22:32,000
ones and i'm like what is this strani's rage heals my soul as well some scottish rage is a

3334
03:22:32,000 --> 03:22:37,440
different type of rage yes cool

3335
03:22:44,000 --> 03:22:48,560
you know we all get really goofy i think we really just like become our truest selves

3336
03:22:48,560 --> 03:22:52,720
in a collab especially the among us collab i can't get over how fun that was the among us

3337
03:22:52,720 --> 03:22:58,240
collab i want to do that again so bad i'm thinking of having some of my um friends on for the next

3338
03:22:58,240 --> 03:23:04,480
one like uh nori and chai chan it can be really fun

3339
03:23:07,760 --> 03:23:10,880
and then yeah emi and ic didn't get to do it last night last time

3340
03:23:12,080 --> 03:23:14,240
so i have a whole cute and funny and then there's me

3341
03:23:16,080 --> 03:23:17,680
i bet i could get like hexa and stuff

3342
03:23:20,000 --> 03:23:23,120
can't be funny some of the other hickenwashi girls

3343
03:23:23,200 --> 03:23:31,360
watch the clip of the among us collab in a sense of freaking funny yeah it was so funny

3344
03:23:31,360 --> 03:23:36,000
and it was well edited there was one i think that uh discount ostrich made he did like a really

3345
03:23:36,000 --> 03:23:41,360
meanie one that was really good shout out to discount ostrich he makes really good compilations

3346
03:23:41,360 --> 03:23:51,200
of us um and he did one of the among us collab and it was literally just so funny and then like

3347
03:23:51,760 --> 03:23:57,120
distrawni just like tricking all of us and like i knew i was on distrawni so many times when i

3348
03:23:57,120 --> 03:24:00,880
doubted myself because i'm like no she would never do that and then i was like why didn't i

3349
03:24:00,880 --> 03:24:07,280
listen to my gut i knew these people were the freaking uh imposters i would also like to do

3350
03:24:07,280 --> 03:24:11,360
like town of salem um i love you still love playing town of salem

3351
03:24:14,160 --> 03:24:17,120
and i feel like that would be kind of better because then we wouldn't have to move around

3352
03:24:17,120 --> 03:24:20,480
as much we could just like talk and just debate the entire time i think that'd be funny

3353
03:24:21,920 --> 03:24:28,000
i'm drunk hello mom are you behaving young man you can only drink at the house you know make sure

3354
03:24:28,000 --> 03:24:36,560
you're safe town of salem super dead oh no i know i haven't played that in a long time i've seen

3355
03:24:36,560 --> 03:24:42,560
like there's like among us adaptations of it so i think maybe that the company was absorbed or whatever

3356
03:24:44,640 --> 03:24:49,280
and then they started with just angrily shouting i remember someone accused her but switched it up

3357
03:24:49,280 --> 03:24:54,640
when you all caught on literally she was like i'll be quiet almost like something's up

3358
03:25:04,960 --> 03:25:09,840
