I got my breadsticks Looks like I'm ready to get boys I I thought you can see me fucking chewing Do the background music for that this one tastes delicious I didn't go all your booty. It's so funny how like What people like how people's opinions change on body types Because I remember like early 2000s It was like awesome if you were like anorexically thin And now it's like and then after that a little bit later 2000s like you need huge titties and now it's like you need a huge ass It's like so funny to me Or fish it in Japanese Damn have to leave for work right as yeah Sorry you might miss out on the appage 99 are you happy? I want to accidentally put something on my keyboard so I can move this on the way I don't even know what to yap about I don't have any idea what to yap about right now I think all my energy Was stolen from the collab and just laughing so hard I She be out of yab It happens Madam do you happen to work in tech my phone's flashing a green tint? I don't know what that means Oh like your phone screen. Do you have a android or an apple device? The club was oh the club was hilarious. Please watch the vod Is an apple did you drop it? If it's flashing a green tint you probably have to take it to the junior bar Because it sounds like you might have loosened a cable I hope you have apple care bro It's apple care, you know screen replacement is 29 bucks, but um, I think depending on the model it's way more than that I apple care on my phone because I drop that shit all the time I For the low price of your soul I know Mike's you tweaking well, yeah, because we were tweaking so we were gonna peak like hell Club was fire if you haven't seen it watch it now if you have watch it again Yeah, we couldn't and we didn't end up doing a power wash simulator because nothing was working So I was like, all right, we're gonna play this. Oh, we don't have that game. Okay, we're gonna play this Okay, we don't have that game All right, play this. Okay. We don't know if that would work properly because we don't have time to set it all up and make Sure, it's fine. Although then we did guard dick phone. It was worked out worked out The boys is back. Are you serious? What? I fucking love that show the boys came back. Okay. I have to watch that then probably watch that tonight It's the last season I thought they were doing five seasons. I know they already got renewed for a fifth season even after this fourth one was released I'm so excited. I I'm so fucking it's that's funny. So I have a guilty pleasure of watching like really cheesy romance shows like Um, so I've been watching like exo kitty on netflix was about like this half korean half white girl who goes to Korea to be closer with her mom And also see like her long-distance boyfriend or whatever But then he figures she figures out that he's like cheating or whatever the fuck it's a long story Um, but they use the same exact school as in gen v And so they break into like the principal's office in one scene and i'm like wait a fucking second This is the same principal office from gen v. I was like, huh? Um, I was just really i'm really amused by that because the juxtaposition of those two shows is quite amusing. Um And but i'm really bummed that actor died because I i really like that actor. He was really good at sabrina Um, he was really good in gen v. I really want to see his character develop more and it really just sucks He died in a um the actor that played the guy with magnetic powers Uh, I can't remember off the top of my head. Uh, he died in a motorcycle accident It's really sad Reminds me of the guy from star trek who Um, he was like had that thick accent, but he was also in a couple other things Um, and he got Crushed by his own vehicle. It like squeezed him between a gate And he was squeezed between a gate in his car and died like that's It's so sad like oh, what a way to go. So there's great talent gone Especially they were both young Yeah, like um like my uncle has a motorcycle And I have like my cousin uh, he's he's really into dirt bikes and I always like worry for them, but it's like It is what like it is a dangerous hobby as long as you can take all the right precautions And it can still be not your fault or something can still happen and you know, that's the same with a car, you know Yeah Oh my god, the soup is so good. It's a little bit too salty though But I'm so I have to watch that then I like I like what was it did somebody make like a reference to like Oh, that's right in that video that someone made a memes of our um Of our debuts and 2.0's they like used a couple the boys memes with like, uh the deep And like strutty and like um octopuses octopi whatever and stuff and I was like I was like wait Why was I thinking of the deep the other day? Every time I think about That actor I just laugh because he plays the deep and then he also plays the main love interest in gossip girl and I just Sends me every time I'm tense. I'm gone Anton Yelkin. Yes. Yes, uh russian peas. He was young too He was really good in star trek and he was also in like, um odd thomas. That was the movie You want me to have you want me to have a alt alt account? Uh reaction to the boys The deep and strong use a scary ass combination you're right Sup sup sup But I just look it was like making jokes about like the octopus and the deep Strani is the octopus and the reeflings are the deep And his original girlfriend the deeps girlfriend is um reeflings Current girlfriends and they're leaving her for the octopus Take a sip be Homelanders and mk. What does that mean? A mortal combat No fucking way. That's actually a perfect character for more mortal combat. That's hilarious Sorry took me a moment Mario Kart Oh Omni-man peace maker. Oh my god, I would love to see a homelander versus um omni-man That's so awesome I personally suck at fighting games I just to be honest I could totally see a crossover of the boys and invincible Not like a cartoon one but like a um like a live action one I was called him glenn. Um, I don't think they would be able to have the same guy as the actor for The main character. I can't remember anybody's names from invincible. What? Iron man invincible. Yeah, I know that. Yeah. Mm-hmm. I didn't know about that The boys getting washed facts Yeah, uh, I don't um omni-man would destroy homelander. I will say it I Also The last season of invincible. I'm sorry, but like It was such a fucking letdown for me I'm like it was just all over the place like the main villain disappears after an episode and then comes back at the very last Episode and like does fuck all and I'm like, okay Excuse me Yeah, I was I was really disappointed It's funny how you can technically put all I guess anyone he gets wiped true He's just he's just psychologically like one of Homelander's traits is he just really knows how to manipulate people really well um Because he's a fucking psychopath And so he knows like It's it's funny because he's not a sociopath because he has empathy um And he but he uses his knowledge of empathy and how people react to things against them. It's very smart Totally unhinged. I actually really like he's one of my favorite Villain characters because he's just so well developed um I think that's why I really liked like I just like you know, you think there's a character you just love to hate And like that is homelander like he's such a like like ah, fuck. I hate him, but he's awesome But fuck him like that's yeah, that's homelander Yeah, the minute you crack his ego he's done for yeah, like he has like he's a super powerful Whatever the fuck likes what do they call them? What do they call people with powers I forget V hero Vagina hero virginity hero a soup. Yeah, he's really soupy um But I would even it's funny because not even a superhero. He's just he just has superhuman abilities Hope they handle them well on the news. I bet they will super powerful man, baby. Yeah, because he's like under like mentally He's just like has not had proper human interaction Gaslight maxi. Yeah, I also really like um Butcher because He's such a like a good anti-hero like I would love to see like uh team up of butcher and the punisher Like that would be a cool crossover Homelander is an incel with a cape But it's funny because he's like At first I'm like, oh, he's like a what like, you know when he's with that One chick who's a nazi which that made me crack the fuck up Like his relationship with her and how he just like would complain about stuff all the time Like she's in that bed and she's just getting me in my handy and she's like half dead Um, basically the dude from mega mine. Yeah, you know But like he's not Like he was it's weird because he like respects people at the same time. He's like, no, no, no We don't we don't we don't treat people like that, but then he'll just like kill people again Like that. It's just so such a funny thing to me. He's like, no, that's where I draw the line racism No I won't allow it Uh, see when he works. Yeah, yeah, that was that was an intense scene Like when he kind of just like switches it on and just like fucking He does have a way with words A milk scene is a very iconic all the best like terrible characters Drink milk in such a weird way It like I remember reading an article of like, you know, you got like jack knuckleson's character I think from one flew over the cuckoo's nest then you have like, uh, the main character from like a clockwork orange And then you have homelander in like what milk Represents because it's usually something that children consume And it's like these adult men consuming it and like twisting innocence. It was such a great article I wish I could recall more of it. It was such an interesting uh deep dive into What fucking milk symbolism was just like corruption like, uh, how they can do this corrupt others But they're also extremely childlike at the same time Homelander is definitely deserve a fan. He's a bleeding heart That would be so funny if they had like a scene of him just like Fapping to a vtuber or like he falls in love with like some online girl Then he hunts her down and like freaks like like I feel like he would be a good yonder, eh? His interaction to the storefront was like, yeah 100% Um Little man, no But uh, yeah, I always love character development And uh tv shows that there's no character development or like the characters are just so infuriate Furiatingly superficial or one-sided. I'm just like I can't consume this Poor boy. Yeah Yeah, that was I actually really liked uh black noir's character. Um It's weird though because It's very different from the comics And I I kind of wish they stuck to the comics because I think that would have been very Interesting to go Down like that route. Yeah the original uh boys comics It isn't as good like the people have said like this tv show I've only read like a couple like a little like bits of uh the comics here and there. Um, but Apparently like the show is actually better than the source material Um There's your comments about yeah The Creator from letter didn't say he's meant to be satirical. Oh, yeah, that's that's totally So prevalent just satire of the american dream. There's a twisted version of the american dream. He is manifest destiny, you know um, but Yeah, it was I would have I would have liked to see how that would have gone down I feel like it would have Been interesting But um, I feel like they'll approach that in another way like because I feel like they're Already kind of approaching that with the sun and everything like what would have happened The comics just an edge of abortion on the justice league. Hey, man. That's what my fan fiction was when I wrote When I wrote a fan fiction I was younger I think this hates superheroes as parodies of them are very surface level. Yeah Hero guys episode was tame compared to the comic. Oh, I did not it was funny. So like My dad's recommended the boys to me. Um and I remember I was watching that season that here guys. I was in he's like, did you get to the episode? I'm like, what he's like, did you get to the hero guys an episode? And I'm like, no and he's like Just walked away Like Okay, and then I like and then I like watching I'm like dad Why did you recommend me the show because I think I started watching it when like the second season came out Or whatever. It wasn't the third season that one was in. I don't remember. Um And yeah, sometimes Sometimes my dad recommends me shows and I'm like, why the fuck did you recommend this to me? He's like, yeah, you'd like this But he's right. I like it It was it's a great show I recommended the boys to my boss. I'm not sure who watched it was wife. Yeah, my mom could not watch that. My mom has very uh My mom is weird because she hates Violence, but she really likes military related tv shows because I think she was watching like seal team or whatever the fuck it's called And I'm like, okay mom, you can't watch the boys, but you'll watch like war Like this is just like out like silly goofy like, you know, it's fake But like that's like based in reality and like war And like like for example My mom really likes outlander Outlander is a great book really great premise if you don't know what it's about It's about this woman who has this ability to go through these special stones back into Ireland I think in like the 1400s and she falls in love with a guy there. Um Again the 1400s was a wild place in scotland. There was a lot of raping and pillaging and murdering and terrible stuff And I'm watching the most fucked up scene from this tv show So my mom's like, oh you'd like it. It has like fantasy and like historical stuff that you like. I'm like, okay And I'm like, oh this dude is totally just On going ham on this poor woman and okay I'm like mom Yeah, my mom likes like medieval shows Um, but she couldn't watch game of thrones Actually, no, did she finish I asked my mom. Did she finish game of thrones? I don't know maybe And it's weird for her she like has to watch something that's like realistic Like it has to have some realism to it or she just can't get into it and like a lot of people are like that So she likes historical fiction because it's like rooted like you can twist the truth just a little bit like it leaves enough for like, um what's the expression Suspensive disbelief whereas fantasy you kind of throw that out the window But like for me, I can understand like and most people can watch it and be like this is fantasy supposed to be like this I don't have to believe in it. Um, she like Rambo probably. I don't know I Wasn't she married though? I think so Thanks mom um Yeah, what I've just been watching a lot of dumb stuff lately I've been in my my lonely woman era. Um Sometimes I just like get into this funk when it becomes like spring summer where I'm like, oh, I'm a lonely person And so I just watched like I or I binge watched this whole like chinese drama one time And it was really good and I was like sad And then I just watched binge watched euphoria and that was fucking depressing as hell I literally cried at the and I don't cry at shows a show depressed me to fuck And I'm like, I need to I need a palette cleanser. So then I watched bridgerton It's fucking great. I love bridgerton I love bridgerton so much. I can't wait for it to come back in a couple days I hate that shows split it up split stuff up into two fucking parts now. That is the stupidest shit ever um Yeah, I was watching that I literally binge watched that stupid tv show It's watching watch the kissing booth on netflix the third one Wasn't as good as the first though Euphoria no euphoria with the people but the kid the angsty kids in high school You guys have said the said this to me before Not that euphoria Not the visual novel Yeah, exactly exactly exactly she'll watch that but she won't watch superheroes Like she'll like watch like a marvel movie, but she like can't get it So like me and my dad were like, oh, we're gonna go see furiosa Um, I just in some of you know why I was watching mad max again. Um, my mom's like, yeah, that's for you guys Okay The one with spider man's girlfriend Huh, I don't love I don't even I don't even read the visual novel. I don't know like I just know it's bad I haven't read that I've only ever read metamorphosis and that was You're one of the 50 people who saw furiosa. I haven't seen it yet. I might just I don't think I'm gonna end up seeing it Um in theaters because I wanted to see you in theaters But it feels like it sucks because it's got really good ratings. It just got like shat on in the box office But I heard it was good I like the actress. Hello Where does he happen? We're just hanging out I like, you know metamorphosizing When I went to see furiosa, I was the only one there. I think it's because nobody fucking knew what it was about like mad max was very hyped Because people remember the old mad max And then people now are just like, okay, but what's that about? Yeah, it's got ania taylor joy or whatever her name is but like Charlie's there in as hot as fuck But um Oh, excuse me Just fear your own flop. I don't I don't recall. It was okay. Like when I watched it again, I'm like, yeah, this is kind of what I remember It was so weird because like listening to um The actor for max talk, I realized that the the movie was like weirdly dubbed every time he spoke Like I know he didn't speak often, but I was like, uh It feels like somebody else's voice. Like I know he has an um, he usually has an english accent Australian or something. I was like, huh? I'm thinking about watching the uh original mad max stuff Metamorphosis showed editing is only relenting watch barbie purely for Ryan gossip. Listen, I liked barbie Maybe it's because I'm a woman. Maybe not. I enjoyed it a lot. I saw with my parents My mom didn't like it I think she was like it so it was okay. I really liked it. I like cried. I cried at that movie. I felt like it hit me My dad was like it was cute. I think my dad liked him more than my mom then again, my dad's a Taylor Swift fan, so Which way was turned black man Taylor Swift from the boys Ryan Gosling is the goat if you watch drive. Yeah, I haven't actually seen drive. I just watched fall guy with my parents Your dad's a swift. Yes I like he he was like, hey, you listen to Taylor's new album. I'm like dad. What the fuck he's like, you know Comrade is a cat and he was like, so I'm sick of that. I'm like, what are you? I'm like dad, since when did you become a Swiftie? He's like her new music bangs. I don't know what to tell you. I'm like, Jesus. Fuck dad I'm not seeing drive. No White women music is timeless. You're not wrong. You're not wrong Again, my both of my parents have very Range tastes and that's why I have very range tastes But it's another reason why I don't like country because I never listened to country growing up I listened to everything else besides country I would go to bed listening to classical music because my mom would make sure I listened to classical music And then I would go to school. My mom would play some 80s music She would pick me up from home and she would play fucking breaking Benjamin in three days grace Depending on the day that she had then my dad would play some like 80s or 90s rap and then All like, yeah, I just I was very well well around it and then I would listen to pop punk and just like alternative and metal Um My mom dated a guy who watched pitch perfect every week and played this soundtrack to him from work Oh god, I would hate that although pitch perfect. Like it was a good movie. I did like pitch perfect the first one Um, some country music is good. I know I have like one of my friends and it's funny because she's like very russian Like very like think of icy But like dialed up to a 10 And I see he's not even russian, but like they have the same accent though dialed up to a 10 and then she Really likes fucking country, but she's also she has like the bluntness that some like culturally russian people just have They're just like very blunt and it can come across as like being a little abrasive But she's a total sweetheart And so she like listens to country and I'm just like this is so weird to me I feel like you should be hating this Basically ice with a vodka bottle in a cake Yeah George story they didn't last long. Thank thank god for her Um, you have a live stream of just them Yeah, I don't think I would do a live stream because they would probably just say My name I did a collab once with some iRL friends Um in my my uh past life and one of them called me by my first name, but nobody noticed None of my audience notice It was very funny I was everybody went silent too because I had like asked them like okay. Don't use my name Please look like the company And uh One of the one of the girls was just like hey, and I'm like doesn't respond Um Yeah, because sometimes this happens and I know like I think my dad would be able to It's call me by she be but I think my mom would Find it hard Because my dad gets it because he watched uh, he watches a lot of twitch streamers and stuff I want to be surprised when my dad got into vTubers now. I have to ask him I maybe I'll recommend him some vTubers. He's a very much He only likes to watch like cod and stuff though and like sometimes fortnite I don't know if there's any maybe I don't think yeah, no my dad doesn't like valent Your dad watching ninja. No, he watched like nick mercs or something I feel yeah, no, I know my dad would like probably really like vTubers if you watch them Your dad the actually the best vTuber. I would see my dad getting a model like that one guy. That's like an orc I have your dad sign up for the next holostars That would actually be so sick though if my dad was at holostars He would get in he was so get in Is that a 14 year old boy? Yes, no That would be so funny. What's the male equivalent of a hag? Because my mom is like definitely like peko mama Um just like chill and shit A gilf She have a papa for holostars. I was like, oh, no, don't call my dad. Oh, do you say no? No, no, no, no Stop it. Cut the cut the cut the cameras. No, thank you I don't like that Is the guysy Adil That's not the equivalent of a hag Silver fox. I like that a zaddy Can't wait to say daddy cotton mom 360 no scope a 12 year old It's really funny because Again, my dad has like a naturally very very very deep voice But he when he's very excited just like me his voice pitches up And I'd be like Chackle hysterically and I'm just uh because like so he would game in the living room And I would game in my bedroom and my mom would just be like chilling watching my dad play or like playing like some like I don't know candy crush while she on her iPad all my dad plays games um And I would just hear him screaming in the next room And my mom's like redacted Be quiet. I'm trying to read I'm trying to study the bible right now My mom oh no, my mom my mom um, I don't know she she kind of like I'm surprised she can sit there and kind of like do her own thing while my dad plays um Because once my dad knows he has an audience like if I'm sitting beside him like when I was like doing homework for school or something That's he starts to narrate and commentate As if he's a streamer And it's it's very very amusing So when he's serious, he's six five, but he's excited. He's five two. That's actually accurate. My dad is is that tall Yeah, he's naturally a streamer. I guess that's where I inherited it from So he would be natural in hollow stars. He'd be like, uh Wait, no, is that Niji Sanji or is that hollow stars again? I don't watch LVTubers. Um, what is his name like gold bullet? Is he the brown who's the brown one? Who are the tan My dad's built different I can see why you're crazy. Yeah, that's accurate Gold bullet is hollow stars. Okay There you go. Like he could be BFFs with gold bullet. That's the type of name my dad would pick for himself Can we just talk about how stupid Male names are like women's names are normal like she be cotton bum. Come on. That's an amazing name Gold bullet Vazelius bandage Who is picking these fucking names? Jesus Gold bullet is an awesome name you take that back Bandit, no it's not Vantacro bringer honestly, if they named him like something Vantacro that would have been cool like Umohoshi Vantacro like that's fine Hanabama is so normal. I don't know what you're talking about. Listen, I didn't get to pick my name either Because they I'm pretty sure they get to pick their names and design their characters. Don't they or is hollow Is hollow also cast for character? Do Niji and hollow allow the talent to make to make your own character? Shibuya just me as uh, what's his name cyborg? Vantacro bringer. Yeah, that's what I thought. Yeah, Vantacro bringer perfect calm van Vantacro bringer You really got bum in your name. Yeah, because I got a fat ass. I'm gonna stick in your face and sit on it Smother you shut the fuck up No, only the second third offense. Oh, okay Streamers pick the names Um, you know, yeah mercy picked her name She was able to pick her name because Karam beat Was just not Not having a good time Shibuya's gyat. No, my gyat is non-existent Um, I remember like yeah, uh, Strani asked me if I wanted to like change anything like I I could have changed like my logo I could have changed I couldn't change like my character obviously, but she's like is Is your name cool? And I'm like, yes, I thought it was hilarious I was like, I kind of liked that. It was very close to being Nijisanji holo stars level of out of pocket Strani, so yeah, oh most of like like you guys know I'm getting a tan toggle You guys know I'm getting a tan toggle Um spoiler. I'm also changing my eye color I Know you might not like it, but I might only use I don't know if it's gonna be only with the tan toggle that my eye color changes Um I wanted to do I know nobody has blue eyes in our gen Nobody has blue eyes, so I'm like give me blue eyes because Yeah, mercies are reddish Strani's are like greenish yellow purple Uh me and Azura have this and I see have the same colored eyes and um Emmys are also purple Yeah, so I'm gonna do instead of blue eyes white dragon. I'm tan she be blue eyes blue eyes tan she be Um Getting glasses. I just like get an asset of glasses. I don't know But I don't know I have to I don't know if it's gonna be a permanent thing that I have blue eyes um Yeah No my gold eyes You know, I love the gold eyes It just it just looked really weird with the tan skin tone to be honest with you because like uh, I was telling her I'm like, oh because our my the artists in the regular are working on it right now and um I don't know when they're gonna be done. I might be like a month or so. So you will not have tan she be quite yet um, because they're also working on cover-ups for me and Azura I think but um I was messing around like okay. Maybe if I had this sort of skin tone I was trying to be close to my normal skin tone But then I was like I was holding up my hands to the thing and I'm like, holy fuck. I'm so pale So I kind of made myself just a little bit darker like when I'm in the like when I've gone to the beach Rather than when I haven't left my home for like a year Tan she be I don't I don't know if I will be tan by monetization. Who knows? Um, but yeah, the the gold, you know what? Fuck it. I'll just show you. I'll just show you the screenshot I sent to strongy and I don't really care Do-do-do Because I was I kind of made the undertone of my skin a little bit too red Um, because I like I kind of so my tan skin kind of does clash with my color palette a bit Um, like if my red was a little bit brighter it might stand out more Because my mixture because like uh, I'm like a mixture of monochrome and um And my my main color is red and that I feel like that works extremely well with my hair and my um My like the yeah in my eyes, but when I'm tan it just doesn't It just looks too red. I don't I don't know how to explain it to you because like it's just like it's all color theory really That's why you see a lot of more like tan Um She was with like if they have warmer colors in their palette It's like an accent color Rather than like a main color, but you know, I'm completely completely wrong or it's normally like cool colored tones It's really depending on like what what type of black you are, you know I mean, where's the screenshot? I Was like this makes like I look just like fucking burnt I look sunburned a little bit Um, and that's with the blue eyes. So it looks it looks pretty nice I realize however the eye the layers on my uh, my right eye We're not cut properly They were not separated at the same as my left eye. So I couldn't get quite the color that I wanted for the for the eye tone Yeah, they look grayish it's it's never meant to be a blue Die my hair. I don't know but I like I like the blonde like blonde with tan skin looks so good Like so I wish I could because I used to uh, I'll be honest with you Um rtx she be I used to have icy blonde hair and it looked fucking gorgeous against my skin Like a fine grilled wagyu Yeah blonde and tan and like I feel like it fits better with the gyaru, you know If it's way better with the gyaru But you'll notice Like you'll see like how my Like my my on my color palette needs to kind of be brightened up In terms of like my reds seem to be a bit more intense because they're like a lighter red So they need to be a little bit brighter. I think You know Um And let me show you the other screenshot I took Yeah, I couldn't fucking get the eyes right Because of the layering issue Because it like just darkened the top my eyes look fucking pitch black Yeah Which way western man Um, I actually like me with darker eyes to be honest with you I look very nefarious. I feel like I look more bunny like especially when I have my little I probably will have like my uwu mouth as a permanent thing because I feel like it shows off that I'm like More bunny like because like it makes my teeth look a certain way It's both an option. Well, it's gonna be a toggle again. I am going to be she be copper bum This is she be copper bum right here Does she be copper bum just like copper cat mouse But yeah, I think like look at don't I look like such a fucking succubus in this picture like god damn I was debating whether or not to like add another mole somewhere too. I think that could be really cute Well, like I'll probably do that in the 2.0 It's copper bum single. Yeah, but she does not want to get with you Um Madam only Uh, my tan lines would go. Yes, like I feel like tan lines would be really good with it too Let me critical it Out of tail I have a tail You just can't see it.

Of course I have a tail Yes, I was telling um Strawny to tell the artist that I need to like I need I'll need to change my ear Um color because I couldn't do it because the the ear the inner ear isn't separated from the the Like the fur part of the ear. So I couldn't change the color of that You can't believe you're coming. I was trans Rachel. Call me Rachel Dozel Call me Rachel Dozel. I am trans Rachel I'm sorry you got yeeted for that Uh any alt costable I want to do ghiattu naturally. I would love to do ghiattu school girl.

I've only become more impressed in enamored as time gone on because of your chill dorky vibes Your maculite memory and your rutless I can't see that What does that mean? Say sexiness. I don't know probably Um, it feels like such a rarity to see someone who doesn't just play a dom in role plays But actually and is and loves being dominant No shade to the people who are putting on an act is still wonderful content But I think it hits different when you know that the words are heartfelt Have you had much real life experience doming people? And if so, are there any particular events or scenes to stand out to? You've been da-da-da-da Uh stream audio is really good at both. It's funny because you're wrong Um Uh, I've been very transparent That I'm normally a switch, but again, I am very knowledgeable with um That side of things Uh, I have not had real life experience doing that Um Sorry Sorry to break the kayfabe for you Um, but I am realizing As I am learning more and you guys are teaching me that I am really fucking enjoying it. I uh Like what I did earlier in stream today where I kind of just bitched at you guys and bossed you around Oh, that was nice. That made me feel very good. You have no idea. I'm telling strongy right now But yeah, um I don't yeah, no, I don't I do I do put on the act sometimes But the majority of the time late like when I first like the first like two days I was putting on an act then after that I was like, holy shit. I actually like this Like I actually don't mind this Um, and if that bothers you I'm sorry But I don't care If it bothers you then I'm normally a switch I don't care. I really don't Cry I want you to cry. Can you record yourself crying to me? So I can fucking laugh at your stupid little boy tears. Thank you Yes Um Madam if I wait I can't read that out loud um Is there anything particular I want in videos and go follow your heart, dude I get a lot of questions asking me to Um, you're more of a bully Yeah, because that's how how am I supposed to do? More dom related things When one this is not an actual Dom sub relationship We have not gone through like actual consent forms. I don't know what you like. I don't know what you're into I can't inflict pain upon you. I can't do the acts you're asking me to it's all audio I am so limited In my character with what I can do Whereas I see She can do age play just fine. It's not hard for her to do that. It's easier to like Regress to a child than it is to an act like one which was appealing to her fan base than to Have me pretend like do you want me to pretend to punch you like? If you can tell me How to be better Within audio related stuff perfect Or on stream someone made a very good. I I um I read it this morning and I took the advice someone said to me You should use your crop intermittently and wave it in front of the mic And make the user anticipate and not know when you're gonna hit it and I'm like that is perfect. Thank you Thank you That is constructive advice Like I'm like that's perfect for a 3do for like whoa, where am I gonna go? Oh, whoops like And so I try to do a little bit of that with this microphone But I didn't really work that well because you can't really hear the movement in front of the mic um So yeah, see thank you.

It could be a fucking toe ring a bracelet A cock ring whatever you fucking you just have to wear it all the time You can't take it off because I own you I can only take it off.

Yeah So glad mercy yeah mercy streams during my bedtime too. Um, she watches you while you sleep though She was telling me she shared you she just sent a picture of myself sleeping. It was pretty crazy Um, is mercy willing to share between viola girls, you know um I hope you guys like understand like when we say like, oh, I want you all to myself That really means like within viola But it's like there's I know there's like super dedicated regulars in everybody's chat um And like It's when like it it it bothers the girls When you say that there you're oh she But then you call another girl your kami oh she Because that's just being a whore derogatory Because we're whores affectionate, you know But like I kind of know I was just responding to the marrow that I was saying out loud that was reading. Um But like I will always support the girls And I don't mind If you watch the other girls, that's fine. I'm I'm someone who I share the love I I want to make sure everybody succeeds everybody that comes into the vicinity of me. Cool. Um The other girls may not be like that. Uh, I'm pretty they're like that within our gen but If they I know I have I've honestly in the past like when I was A priestess I would see like my regulars and someone else's like my french chat. I would honestly Get super upset Because like I don't know. I was it was like I was like, oh, I just caught you with another woman. Um But I think I've grown since that Since, you know, a couple months ago Um to be fair, I probably use this term for idol culture called kami oh shi But no, sorry. Sorry. It was like they go I misspoke. They would call someone kami oh shi and then the girl kami oh shi That's what I meant Not oh shi oh shi because I almost said oh shi Oh shi, but then I was like no oh shi kami oh shi that I meant to say kami oh shi oh shi kami oh shi kami oh shi Say that five times fucking fast Yeah, exactly. So mercy knows who's done that because you some of you have done it I know too now Uh This is a good question. This is a very good question. Okay, this is probably a weird question This is what they started off with but I just don't want to cause trouble I am not 100 into dom sub but I watch you for your taste in games base takes memes and jokes Still, there is quite some role playing in chat Should people like me rather be lurkers and not interact? I have the feeling I would destroy the hegemony in chat um You can respond to what you respond to so like if you were Not into like what I did earlier like you don't have to respond to that you're not obligated to participate if you're not consenting because um That sort of plate is all about consent Um, I do make the jokes about like I don't believe in a safe word, but you know in real life Consent is important and I'm not going to force you To talk in a chat that you're not comfortable in You know like, um So difficult as I like with hanging on my singular talent so it makes me feel horrible and torn. That's yeah, that's why I'm like I don't I want you to enjoy who you enjoy I don't want you to feel bad But then I also have people on the other hand who wish I was more possessive So I'm like I am possessive of you guys I do get a little hurt when I see you in somebody else's chat not the other but it's funny. It's not the other girls like I'm like I don't know. It's like It's like we're all sister wives I think Yeah, I don't know. I don't really know You'd have to ask them you have you'd have to really ask them because I'm like, uh, you know, what is what it is Where should we send the color proof right you send to my mirrors? Take a picture put it in cat box um But yeah, you don't have to you can lurk Um, you can only you can talk when you want to participate Um, I don't if you like say like hi and I'm just like you're a fucking bitch Like I don't think anybody's gonna freak out And if they do who the fuck cares If it bothers them so much they'll just ignore you If it throws off the flow of chat, then I probably just might not respond but don't take it personally um, you gotta learn That like it's the internet Why do you give a fuck about what people think about you? In a vtuber bunny dominatrix group chat especially, you know Everybody's saying hi. Hi. Hi. Hello I'm still so dark. Should I I should um, I think we're good for call of the lamp for now. So I'll quit that No, I should probably save I'm red. Ah red whooping jump scare Oh my god, I'm still red. Why hasn't it gone away? I got a sunburn There you go And then I forget how pale I am Oh me for real for real It's just like she's Deadpool So mad. Oh, no, that's my crying.

Uh, please do not make AI art of me Using my model, please do not feed my model uh Into any sort of AI thing if you're like Just like generating stuff and one just happens to look like me. That's fine. But please do not Take my model Do that like I Am an artist. I also just I don't like it just doesn't look good Like what is what is that? Uh, there was like a meme. I think it was like a flork meme like uh these like This the sex uh post don't mean anything nor anymore. There's no like life behind them. There's not enough horny or whatever the fuck Um, yeah, they look weird the art style isn't consistent Um, I'm not a huge fan as someone who's an artist I'm not a good one, but I'll say I'm an artist. Uh, I would hate that Uh, I'd rather you draw a shitty picture of me Yourself, that's it. Um Again, I can't Really police that it's really just like a trust thing Um If you do it and I see it I'm just probably not going to acknowledge it Sorry Yeah I just busted a fat fucking note on the final image of your twitter game.

Jesus Christ These white boys be tripping walk away Is it considered criminal if it's taking three different art styles and blending them together to make a new style Yeah, because it's still not original. That's not It's not that a whole I'm not gonna like go through a whole AI art debate because Like I just said like I'm not a huge fan in like when I first was um My twitter using my twitter I liked like a lot of AI art Because I didn't know it was AI and then I go in and I'm like wow the person might have worked must have worked super fucking hard on this Wow And I looked in their point their fucking profile and they're like generated using blah blah blah and I'm like oh the fuck And I went on an unlike shit and then my whole like I kept getting tricked I still get tricked and I'm like dude.

I'm just burping while you're talking because I don't care. Um cool Or whatever. I guess Wow gosh Yeah, it's because a lot of the AI art has a distinctive style because there's like one person they mostly fed the algorithm on um, I forget what the artist's name is I remember, um Reading it the other day. He's like a famous comic artist Remember an AI broke out ratioed by one piece to animator I remember when like crony called out and a not even she didn't even call somebody out She's just like, I don't like this. Can you put this someplace else and they're just like this is an AI and it's like freaked out Um They put why must you hurt me by shaving twice in one hour relax Relax, I got it the first time you don't have to send it to me twice Unless you think you made a mistake then I guess I can't really blame you for that She just said you oh, yeah, that's what it was. Sorry. I don't really pay attention that much Wait, you're half black. How can that dumpy not clap? Did your white half funnel it all to your chest? What a travesty she we should have the back bedonk-a-donk that is her god's given right and then her back which suffer less too That's not how it works. Also. She could have suffocated the entire harem under her bodacious cheeks such an injustice. Um I still have a fat ass Wait, I did I literally just tried to move my model as if I'm gonna turn around But uh, you can just pretend by my hips And how my thighs are But yes, it's big. Oh by the way, um when I was messing around with trans making my stuff transparent Uh I got to see my butt fangs I didn't know I had any And I was like, oh They were whoo They were fangin They were banging and fangin Um, so yeah, you don't have to worry about that My nose is itchy um It's funny because my dad's side all of big butts And my mom has a big butt But I just don't I guess I've been told I have A big butt, but I just don't believe people so I could be wrong, you know I could be wrong Because I just look at strawberries. I'm like, I don't have that Me with my flat ass, yeah, but you're a man, so you're fine Hello, madame Would you be so kind as to bless us with your thigh peak once again? I thought I had saved the day you blessed us, but apparently I'd not I checked your twitter I'm not to rectify my grievous mistake, but sadly you had already deleted as much to my dismay No, I'm not going to you can just wait for the thigh cam I was tired of people being like damn you have the goosebumps and I'm like Haven't shaved I didn't shave my legs for like three days Um, and by the way a lot of girls legs look like that even when they do shave Uh, they just apply a lot of filters to their shit I believe anything you see posted on the internet. Um Anyways, you fast become my oshi. I love the energy you bring and I'm glad you let your true self try True self shine through. I've been an enjoyer vtuber since COVID lockdown days. I never truly had an oshi And I'm glad to call you my oshi. May you you and all the rest of you will be blessed with success and happiness That was so nice That was so nice Wow, the fact that you think I am your oshi and you haven't been able to find one and then you see me and I've only been here for like a week And uh, that means a lot to me. You don't yeah that just I just like it's hard for me to like Like why the fuck maybe we like me like it's That's just but that's that's everybody everybody has a little side of themselves are like, yeah, but why like how Why could you like me like how could you because it's so hard to like sometimes accept compliments and reflect on yourself and be like, oh, I do have good qualities and um Like I definitely love myself But I and like I practice self-love, but I just a lot of stuff. I feel like I don't deserve Yes, imposter syndrome. Um, and that's what happens. Like I was very small when I was rena Uh, I probably I at most had like a 50 Uh ccb like current viewership um I only had like a couple regulars in my chat. I mostly had lurkers um So when I go from that to the sort of audience I have now Lots of eyes on me lots of support lots of the it's just it's very overwhelming That goes for all the girls. I know mercy is dealing with the same thing right now It's like we all can't handle being liked as much as we are because like We expected so much more hate We were fucking mentally prepared to get absolutely shit on by the community But it didn't happen. We are okay. And that might be actually due to because we didn't get any sort of coverage from like the drama channels um because like like after we like I um A lot of people admitted That they're like, oh, I thought you were going to crash and burn Or this was gonna happen or that was gonna happen um, and then they watch us And they're like I was actually wrong and I love you And I'm like, please just like give people a chance. Yeah, you look at a small agency starting up They can surprise you like you may plus surprise me. They have wonderful talented girls Um when they first showed up, I remember I was gonna apply to them when they first Opened auditions, but I it was too busy with my real job. So I didn't get around to it. Um I could have ended up there, you know It ended up in the other places I applied to um Just yeah, and that's okay. You can totally admit like I was one of those people. I was like a naysayer because You assume the it's not an unusual thing for people to assume the worst so they avoid being disappointed But I'm happy That we were able to surprise and delight everybody with how Wonderful we all are Collectively and we all have different niches and different styles and different Ways about how we um go about things Um So, yeah Thank god the worst case scenario didn't happen everybody's like, oh, I remember my favorite comment my favorite negative comment that I saw was How long is it gonna take For one of them for it to come out that one of them is a sexual predator and I'm like Jesus fucking christ Are you serious? There are so many loutubers in the vtuber community and you be you just assume That we're gonna be sexual predator like what? I was like that was just like out of malice or something like do you you just you don't want us to succeed and that's why you said that like That like blew me away generally and this is before I even gotten to be alert like even just like being a normal viewer and being excited for the girls like I had like the Auditions hadn't even opened yet type thing They're like it's gonna be so funny when one of them gets out as a sexual predator or this i'm like what the hell There's so many different loutubers that are normal people like melody Partic melody is a lovely person. She's so sweet her normal streams are adorable And then you know you realize people just love to hate What they don't know We're on a stand yet because we are the first of our kind being a lewd focused YouTubeing agency Normally that isn't the standard So I can't blame some of you who are who are just like, uh, I don't really think this will work um But I will explain the people that are like they're probably horrible human beings like that was I just thought that was a totally Terrible thing to say about people you didn't even know yet And again, I wasn't even a talent yet. This was like way back when dealer was announced I was like damn I feel bad for those girls When they get picked wow I'm here. Um, yeah reflects more on the speaker. I'm like, what are you saying? What have you done? Hmm. Hmm um Melody collapse someday that'll be great. I hope so I would love to learn from her Um, I feel like she could teach us a lot Her loves to hate and find any reason to do so. Have you seen any of the joked drama? I was like, I don't even know who that is What's that? Who is that? I think a lot of people just want to watch dramas again. That's true. People love drama um That sort of stuff pulls eyes gets views um, I know that false only really covered us because there was a lot more vocal angle to like Actually, it was I feel like it was kind of even on both sides in terms of like who was Not for it and who was and even like, um kaiyo And he's was more like a little bit unbiased when he covered the um The announcement of velour again. This was me Observing this when I wasn't even a talent when they first announced auditions Um, or not. They first announced the company before they announced auditions, um He was just like they both I noticed they both started off with the A good amount of negative comments that were said about us and like responding to the tweet of them going Going live um, and then they followed up in the There's their cover their cover story of like one or two or three nice things And I was like And then all the like the comments that were boosted were the more negative ones like yeah, I don't really see this working out They're probably gonna burn out or they're probably not gonna want to do it Or they're probably gonna do this and probably gonna do that Or he just can wait and see what happens Um, everyone's going through their own battle attack them now. They're fighting two battles. Boom. Yeah Did you decide you I was the first person who applied? Starny said I applied 20 minutes after stuff opened Uh, I was the first person to apply To be there That is because I recorded my video three days in advance because I was so anxious. I'm getting it perfectly I worked really hard on it I Yeah, that's the uh I was ready. I wanted this for since a certain rtx strongy mentioned doing it again Making her own company. I'm like, I'm in I want that. I didn't think I would get in I was so ready to be disappointed. You have no idea but Yeah, I'm here And I'm so happy I am Happy I get to be with you guys I will just say this melody right now is the godmother of lutubers and she we learn a lot. Yeah, like I'm always Uh, like there's a lot of lutubers in the community. Um, that are of course way bigger than us. Um People like to like crack jokes and be like, ah Everybody's freaking out because like viewers the competition. We're not We're not established. We're just starting out Um, yes, we are have certain strategies to get support with like our patreon. We have like, you know cheaper options um well like And I can speak for all the girls. We actively want to learn from the bigger vtubers in the community because we can learn a lot like We're just starting out A bunch of us were very small before we were in a v in velar And didn't even dream of being in a corpo uh I've only been a vtuber for six months like I've said and But mind you I've still worked very hard to be here. Don't get it twisted. Um If I can grind it out for a very long time I heard a velar when I first announced I forgot about it. I only remembered that they have to be a lot of people were like that Was funny, uh Lost face to grow. Yeah Yeah, it's there are a lot of luteubers, but again, there's not a there's not Corpo luteubers, um, there are I can't stop burping with the fuck um there are girls in corpos that really Fucking dance that line Of being completely on say so and doing crazier stuff than Or stuff as much as us And they just like but they like dress it up in a cute little bow and be like I'm not doing anything bad. Um There's those girls We just say the we I always make the joke we just say the quiet part out loud we're like Because like a lot of a lot of fucking girls and agencies are like us. They just They're just not allowed to do what we do They would probably make the content if they um wanted to Um, and if they were allowed to by their by their uh companies Never heard of you learn till debut personally. Yeah, and that's fine. Like I'm it's glad you're here Glad you're here. If you just just caught us on debut if you knew from the beginning Um, if you followed strontae before she was strontae then Yeah, just You can't you were here for a reason You're here for a reason I almost said a reef link. You're here for a reason rafling. Um But yeah You can't say I've gone sph for mothers, but you'd be surprised They're you'd be surprised because they again they dress it up as other things They they tease you with uh, but they just use different words, but it's the intention Is that Um, but some people now you can just enjoy being you know, the bluntness of just being like, yeah I want you to boop out of my beep and made it with a beep on boo with a boop like all that shit. Um Yeah I apologize for being too needy and chat madam You scolding us and ording around honestly Can't read that part. Uh, let me she be also you're not a whore you're a madam That's funny. Um These are just really so exciting at 10 times. Um, I don't really think you guys are needy You want I think you got we like some of you complain a lot But lately since I've like I said something the other day everybody's kind of shut up. I noticed Which is finally nice So I guess I will just be more Straightforward because normally again, I'm a very nice person. I don't like being mean. Um And so sometimes I don't want people to think That I like genuinely hate them Because to be honest with you I just don't have the energy to hate people on the internet that just say a mean thing about me When I'm just being an anime girl. So like Um, yeah When I was Also, you're not a whore you're a madam Uh, while I was thinking of she be uh, your name warped in my thought to Shibizi which is very rude. BZ is not a good word for women and I don't think we use BZ. What does that mean? Should I not say that out loud? Did I fucking just say something inappropriate? It Means bitch formally used for women Oh, it means it's a slang term that means someone who is okay. It's like a bitch. Okay Okay, cool We're not getting cancelled. We're fine. It's just it was just used to be slang for like just essentially just like A colloquial off word slang for a woman boomie. Hi, mr. Titties. Can you get your asshole out of my face? You're gonna clean your ass boy. Oh, you are so heavy. Hello, handsome What's up? You just want attention? You just want attention? Do you guys already all eat your all your food? I need to refit refill your um feeders You put you down. Oh my god. You're so heavy. I think he's like 15 pounds now. He's such a big cat It's all fucking muscles Like in my castle tree What's this Oh, what's this? You want chicken? Oh, you want chicken? Want chicken? And you do the move That's the fucking game wire No Are you guys, like it like a baby girl Guys, I can't put it on your plate if your faces are in the film, I'm good. Back up. Back up. Here, relax, relax. Come on. Right now! Right now! Right now! Right now, where'd you go? Right now! Oh, right there. Right, here you go, Mom. Shhh! I don't need to. Here, come up. Do you know how to get down? You'll get confused. Like, I jumped up here, but I don't know where to go. Fuck... Okay, give him some wet food as a little treat. No, I know you guys can hear me. It's not like... I don't care if you can hear me. My informant's fucking small. I only mute for pee. I cover all intensely. Let's make sure I talk to our cats. What am I reading? Bad mute? I didn't mute. Distant she be my blood. A flavor of wet food, I give him chicken. Oh, is it like those small shorts about little Jimmy who moved bricks for a year and only got an apartment for two square? What? I love the stuck in the closet in your house, roughly. Mute for pee, bad mute. Oh, I see. And once they dried cat food as a kid, that explains a lot. It's not like... My house is like pretty normal size, to be honest. Like, it's actually bigger than my childhood home, but my childhood home was really small. I just have an open concept in my apartment, so that's why it's echoey when you can like... Yeah, when I walk away, because they're like, ah! Sorry, I don't mean to blow out your fucking eardrums. So like, I have my living room area on one half of the room, then I have my kitchen area on one half of the room, and then I have my bedroom, and then I have a bathroom, and then I have a giant walking closet, because it honestly doubles as a bedroom if I want it. Like, I literally probably put it at like a little like sleeping bag down. Guys can sleep over, we can have a little sleep over. We are in the walls. It screws apart from on, where the cage goes. Yeah, the cage is um... Actually, the cage is in the living room right next to the TV, so you can have some sun, um, because like, I have a balcony as well. I need to get furniture for my balcony. I've lived here for almost like two years, and I still don't have fucking balcony furniture, and like, I go outside and I just stand there awkwardly. Oh, I got a fart. Nice. Um, hammock for the butt. No, it's not big enough for that. I'd probably get like one of those cute little like, suspended egg chair things, or like something I could put my feet up on, just curl up with a book and a blankie. I told you, you only get one tooth for free on stream. Can you find it? I don't know if you can. It's been there. Happened in another stream, not this video. Uh, anyways, um, the rest of this message makes absolutely no sense. Actually, it makes sense, but like, this person was rambling and it's kind of funny. They're just like talking about like, the entomology of the word, BZ, and like, references and pop culture of the word. That's kind of funny. This is sorry at the end. Probably baked. Honestly, sounds like it. Shibi, you know what would be really silly? You should put Ona on throne and pretend to tie us and use it on us while degrading us for ASMR or a joy for Patreon. Would that be silly and funny? And ha ha. Anyway, love you, you goofy bitch. Enduring. Um, I don't. You want me to buy an Ona and use it on what? One of my doze? One of my doze of dild? Like, I don't, I'd be like, oh, like, I'm gonna look so weird. Oh, damn you. Damn you. Um, the maintenance man is gonna come in for me. I ran into him again, by the way. I ran into one of the guys, the one of the maintenance men that came in. One of them fucking hates me. The other one was nice. And he held the door opened for me when I was bringing in a giant with a giant ass packages. You guys got me from throne. I'm like, I'm carrying all my horror merchandise. What do you think you do again? No, for those of you who don't know, my maintenance men came to change my air filter. And oh, hi, Raina. Did you enjoy your chicken? She just like flopped into my arms. How cute. Oh, are you going in the bed? Okay, there you go. Um, they knocked on the door. I had my headphones on. I didn't hear them. So I didn't answer. They let themselves in thinking it wasn't home. They realized I was there. They're like, oh, hey, we're just here to show the filter. And I'm like, okay, weird that they didn't like set a notice ahead saying that they're going to do that sort of stuff. I realized after they left, I had left toys everywhere in a door hanger thing that says do not disturb, but masturbate. And then one of them told on me for having cats. They have an extra cat. I have a bonus cat. I think it was a dude that always looks at me to discuss when he sees me. The other guy just like looks at me sheepishly like he doesn't know what to do with himself. Um, they're new because like we, I, I'm like, they go through maintenance men so much because there was another guy that came in like a month ago to fix my, because I have a trash. What is it called? Uh, trash disposal. And it wasn't working because it wasn't like there was like some, apparently I thought something came on screwed, but there was apparently just like something in there that got stuck. Um, and it was like this totally different guy. And then there's other guys. Okay. I'm like, I've never seen you before. Who are you? And that's why I was like, I initially freaked out cause I'm like, I've never, these, you are not the normal maintenance man. The fuck? There was somebody before that and I haven't seen them. I'm like, they're killing the maintenance men. They're just like, you didn't do a good job. Death. They're just replacing them like, like, uh, cast members and they're hoping that you don't even notice. Um, but yeah, what? I thought like half just growling, but something was just like, there's like, sometimes a, my bathroom fan like vibrates a certain way and it's freaked me out. Um, man, I hate when rental staff don't give the heads up. Oh, at least an apartment that way. Yeah. That's why I'm like, I feel like legally and where I'm from, they're not allowed to do that. They have to give 24 hour notice. So I was going to bring that up when I went to the landlord and I was like, Hey, you guys technically came in when you weren't supposed to get a heads up. I was from the spot. That's why I said you could come in and it ended up being like, I, but I didn't even have to use that because the lady was chill anyways. It was just the other bitch property manager that was being annoying. I was like, Oh, you're, you're fine. You're a good tenant. And I'm like, thank you. Thank you so much. Yeah. I got you for maintenance, man. As a person who mainly came for the Fendham vibes, I was shocked that I got a female bro along for the ride. Oh, bro. Looking forward to your future endeavors and hopefully you get more of those awesome dubs of yours. Yes, you are more dubs coming soon, coming right at you like right in your face, coming in your face. Don't you, don't you worry about it. Um, yeah, you're my bros. We're bros and sometimes make out. Sometimes, you know, some of you, my boyfriend, girlfriend, if you're into that, you know, boyfriend, girlfriend, Ryan Gosling voice, boyfriend, girlfriend. Don't, you know, let me get to your head. Okay. Some of you are dogs and I'm your owner. You can decide what you want us to be. I will give you that one freedom. Okay. This got that GF bro. Yeah, I can be your bro, Brogif, your bro GF Brogif, you know, but I'm glad that like I, I'm happy that I pleasantly surprised people because people are like, oh, she's going to be like this really reserved Dom and be like this and like that and just be like really like, really like maybe like coup d'etre. Um, I thought about being that and I'm like, you know, I'm going to be my authentic. Nah, I'm going to do me. Um, I want to be my authentic self. I don't like lying and then it probably would fade away after a month or two anyways. Authentic self, best self. Yeah. So even though the other girls struggle with that, be like, oh, should I act a certain way? And then in the end, like strong, he just really nailed. She's like, I hired you for you. I didn't hire you because like of this, this or that you could do this voice or do that or do that. Like I hired you for your personality and I was like, takes mom wipes away tears. Um, you can be my ex. I got everything in the divorce. Sorry. Shut it in a prenup. Um, if you were to hypothetically allow us to send proof of us following instructions, what would that be? If the answer to above is I might be going too far. Could we chat, get a bonk instead? Uh, most of you have already done so. So I'm like, I guess I'm fine with it. I don't know. Um, yeah, I don't. I don't know. I bonk chat anyways. We're bonking right now. Okay. Sorry. Let me refresh this. Oh, now I have to go through and physically answer these. Eventually, maybe I won't. I might be a little bit too lazy for that. Um, I need to scratch my booty. My booty cheeky. Um, outside of a stream chat and especially on other social media platforms, what would you say their dues and don'ts when coming to talking comes to talking interacting with you? Uh, you guys have interacted me with me pretty normally. I can't really think of anything that sticks out besides the people that have complained about like the doming on like not being a dom enough. But I've already addressed that, uh, going forward from the stream. I'm not going to address it anymore. You're just going to get blocked and ignored because, uh, madam shouldn't have to repeat herself, especially to dumbasses who complain like that. Um, into the other girls too, by the way, if you complain about them. Oh, I see. Isn't this enough? Amy isn't this enough? Mercy isn't this enough? Azura isn't this enough? Strawny isn't this enough? I'm just literally going to ignore you. Just like there's so many other girls, uh, in different agencies and Indies that will probably be better up your alley then. Um, I'm not a pushover. I'm not going to bend to your will. Uh, I am in control here. Do not forget that. Uh, I think I'm trying to think of, uh, probably maybe the people that like role play being Dom with me, like that's kind of, it's not even like, oh, you're trying to like Dom me because I'm a dom or like fighting for, you know, being the alpha or whatever the fuck. It just comes off so fucking cringy. Like, like somebody sent me something like, oh, what if I were to come in and tie you to the bed and use you the way that I want to, and then you don't have, you don't get to say anything and I get to be used, use free use. I'm like, I just didn't respond. I just blocked him as the next person. I'm like, I wouldn't do anything, uh, because that wouldn't happen. I would call the police. Uh, like, yeah, they're trying to find the switch button, but it's like, it's not, you're not going to get that. Like the, you're not like, I am a Dom first and foremost. My audios might reflect differently because the scripts I have to fill on stream. I'm your mother. You do well to behave. All right. Uh, I'm your madam. I'm your mother. I'm your owner. I wear the pants in the relationship. You do not. Uh, I might be sweet. I might be nice to you because I'm a human being and Dom's aren't dicks all the time, by the way. I hope you knew that. Uh, they're just not fucking beating the shit out of people 24 seven. That's fucking stupid. If you think that, um, I'm going to be nice to you when I want to be. And I'm going to treat you terribly when I see there's an opportunity and you seem that you want me to do that. Um, could you be my father too? Yeah. I'm your daddy. Call me daddy. Call me daddy right now. I'm waiting for it. When did you call daddy and chat? Perfect. Oh, actually, I like being called daddy. Hello. It's kind of, it's kind of hot seeing like guys be like, yes, daddy. It's kind of hot. I don't know. Did that just awaken something in me? Damn. Maybe it's like the corruption. Um, noted. Uh, I think that's definitely like a gender role thing, like reversal. Like I am, I'm the man, this relationship or the woman. Maybe that's, maybe that's it. I don't know. I have to dive into that. She got unlocked again. Dad, please put the belt down. Not again. Not the belt. That shit hurts. I've hit myself with a belt because my mom, my mom and my dad were like, oh, we were going to use a belt. You're lucky we don't use a belt on you. And I'm like, yeah, this doesn't hurt. And I was like, ah, on my arm. Daddy, she be model one, like as in my dad, dad or like me as a dude, because I would look, I would be the sexiest. What is it? Ikeman, Ikeman, Ikeman, Ikeman. I was deaf spanked as a kid. Okay. I have to share that. Oh, to be belted by daddy, she be. That's me come to papa. And you just like not on my leg or something because you're humping it or whatever. Yeah, I think just people trying to be that because they're like, yeah, they're trying to like, think I'll be submissive with them. Um, no, no. Even if you like, even if I was like, like if I was in like icy shoes and I was like doing her character and her niche and she is like, definitely a switch because she's like, you know, I keep, I keep smacking the mic with my hands because I throw them around. Like she's a cute little girl. You're her odyssin. But then she's like a little feral polar bear. Like, even if you talk to me like that when I was in like my cute space, um, I would literally just like want to fucking punch you because that's cringy as fuck. And that's not how you do that. Like there is a right way to Dom and there's a right way to be a sub in the way that some of you guys try to Dom is so fucking pathetic. Father, may I have a piece? Oh, come here. It's funny. One of my, um, emotes is me going up ease. So you guys will be able to use that. It just knows the rabbit mouth. Yeah. I like having this on. I prefer it. It prefer Dom and women. Yeah. I'm like, you have, I'm like, you definitely have never touched a woman before. You won't. It's like, this is like you talk like how you only watch porn, you know, it's no right way to be Dom. But looking at some of these messages, the chair is the wrong way. Exactly. Cause I have like, and it's funny because like I've seen like some of the stuff like you'll send like Amy and I see or like kind of like the target demographic for being like, like their subs. Like, and nobody talks to them like that. Like they, they, like they treat them with respect. They're like, oh, I just want to take care of you, pan for you, do this, do that. And then like sometimes they'll say something a little bit more charged, but it's never like, I'm just going to like, what if I did this to you and did that? Like, what are you going to do about it? I'm like, nobody sends them that shit. They send them normal shit. I'm like, why are you sending me the shit? I literally, I remember there's like one, somebody said something like that. And I was like, I see, come get your OG son. And she's like, I don't want him. Yeah. It's like people have this idea of like what it is to be this or that. And it's, it's, and honestly, like porn has a, I keep smacking the microphone because it's right near my hand. It is because of porn perpetuates on like kind of like role stereotypes for things because like you always see the fucking girl getting choked out, pounded. Oh, yes, daddy. Oh, yes, daddy. Oh, yes, please. Oh, yeah, you fucking shit. Like, no, it's not real. Their existence challenges their masculinity. They don't know how to deal with that. But like, but like, if I challenge your masculinity, you don't have to interact with me. Like that's like you don't, like people feel like they have been like they need to like they have to respond to something you don't have to. Like if you don't like me, you don't have to watch me right now. If I'm not your cup of tea, you can watch one of the other girls that you're totally fucking entitled to that. Like you don't have to try to prove yourself. You're the alpha male. Just be a regular dude. Just be yourself. Please. Emotional damage. It is real emotional damage. Everybody's sending me really cheesy jokes now. It's illegal to laugh out loud in Hawaii. You have to keep it a low hot. Fucking God. I've heard that one before. You guys fucking suck. Oh, another one. Why did Sherlock Holmes go to the Mexican restaurant? He was looking for a good case of Dia. Good case idea. Good case of Dia. Oh, you guys are so fucking funny. Hi, CB. I just want to say, congrats on your debut. You've been working so hard and streaming daily more than once daily most days. And I really appreciate your content. Also enjoy how really you are with us, your chat and your crazy antics always make me smile. Thanks very much for all your hard work. You're truly another one of your followers. Thank you so much. I always thought it was a detriment to my content that I talk so much and that I overshared. And then I realized people really appreciate that transparency. And I'll be honest with you. I'll watch other streamers and I don't think they talk as bluntly as I do. I hear a weird noise. Oh, it's boomie hysteric. He's pushing a one of the cat bowls around full of the food because he's like pushing it as he's eating. And I don't mean like I'm blunt in a negative way. Sometimes it can be. Sometimes I let myself kind of go too far and say things that I probably shouldn't. But I feel like with most restrictions or like ideas of how someone should be in a community. Like I really pride myself on these deep talks that we have. I personally I don't get those a lot. Especially like I can't really talk about like VTubing stuff with people except for you guys. I don't have any people that like friends that watch VTubers. So yeah, I love these talks. Yeah, I'm a little crazy. I'm a little cuckoo. I'm a silly, silly Billy. As for my streaming schedule, it's going to be a bummer because next week I'm not streaming as much. I'm going to probably be streaming for the minimum two hours each time. Just because I have to work. I am actually working full shifts. I don't start my part-time job for a couple of weeks, which fucking sucks. I might... I am debating on leaving my job completely and just kind of throwing it to the wind. Yeah, I'm just debating to not even bother with a part-time job. Just because it'll be... I'll be honest with you. I don't know if I'll have the same energy because if I'm working eight hour shifts interacting with people all day and talking all day, I'm not going to want to talk as much. But then I remember I did it back when I was an indie, so I'm like, I can do it again. So I will try my best. Please be patient with me. I have like a couple days off a week. I will be taking more days off just so I can recharge because I've been streaming every day for multiple hours. I've been pulling a strone. And like this person said, I have been streaming twice a day like I'm doing today. So I know you're probably used to my consistent time as well of being 4pm Eastern time. That is probably going to change in the next few weeks. But again, honest, if... If I perform well enough and Patreon does well, everything does well, again, I will probably fucking quit my job and just try to do this full time. And maybe I'll do it anyways, even if I don't have the target amount that I want to make yet. Oh, aren't you funny. Dumbloser tipped $4. Thanks Dumbloser. Hello mom, I would like to beg for attention by donowing money to disrupt your stream with a funny joke. Oh, lovely. A woman walked into a bar. She said out. That was so fucking stupid. The name was pretty apt. Name checks out. Was it an owl? She said a woman. He said a woman walks into a bar. She said out. I've heard like the two men walking to the bar and they say out and honestly I find that funny. Funny joke. I didn't get the first part of the joke. A woman? Yeah, a bar, a metal bar. Some people might have not gotten that if they maybe English is in their first language. I prefer the pirate one. A pirate walks into an hour. How do you not get it? Relax, don't be mean. Some people don't get it. They're a little bit slower than others. Leave the people who are ESL alone. They're trying their best out here. But yes. Hi, Sheedy. My name is Sheedy. You watch gushing over magical girls. If not, you should check it out. Love you, you goofy bitch, endearing. You goofy bitch. I've never heard of gushing over magical girls. Maybe I will check it out. I'm Adam Sheeby. Here's your joke for, wait a second. One of you just exposed yourself. Oh, interesting. This is you, huh? Okay. Someone. Oh, because I recognized a little fate. Okay, interesting. Because some of you guys write in a very unique style. And I like to play a game if I can match the person messaging in my chat. He's fucking exposed himself. Hi, Madam Sheeby, here's a joke for you. A pirate walks to a bar. The bartender looks at him quizzically and asks, Sir, are you aware that you have a steering wheel attached to your pants? The pirate looks at him and responds, Oh, and it'd be driving me nuts. Everybody really likes that one. I guess he nailed it. Oh, yeah, you preferred it. Sorry, bro. Get exposed. Madam, I'm thirsty. I need fresh supplies to be made. It needs to be direct from the source. Will you allow me to hydrate myself? Will my do my best at making you feel good as well? Are you going to also get me a drink? That'd be nice. PS, I love you for being you. You're my Kamiyoshi. I'm your fucking co- I'm your Kamiyoshi! Stop. Stop, I don't deserve that. I don't even do anything. Why do you fucking talk and do silly voices? I'm not a singer. I'm not doing crazy content. I'm not this, I'm not that. I don't know why. Highlights and shambles now. You'll be surprised at how far funny voices can take you. Thank you for making every day bearable from your tweets and streams alone. Bless your heart. Is it shiv over? Probably we'll make some fresh Ibanez after this stream. I'll try to make sure that audio doesn't get corrupted when I do that. When I sent the tip, I was messing with you. I was an attempt to disrespect you and for that, I'm sorry. No, this is an attempt to dodge the timeout. I had that coming. Ah, ah, ah. Ah, ah, ah. Ah, ah, ah. You picked the wrong time to mess with me, boy. You picked the wrong time to mess with me. You think when I'm putting you in your place, that's the opportunity to tip and say, no, I'm not gonna do it. Remember, I don't, I don't like brats. If you're a brat, you're gone. I don't want anything to do with you. But you apologized. You guys are, again, we're getting to know each other. You didn't know this about me. You didn't know when I switched it on. I don't like to be interrupted, although I said in my debut, I don't like to be interrupted during playtime. Um, you'll be forgiven. You're gonna be, you're gonna stay in your timeout. And I'm gonna both think about what you've done. Okay? If you're still lurking, your apology is accepted. Didn't she say that? Anuma's tip, $2. Anuma's? Oh, great. Uh, thank you for the $2. Uh, moving on. Hi, Madam Sheeby, do you ever wear glasses at all? Uh, I'm wearing glasses right now. Because I'm fucking blind. Or do you find glasses attractive? Do you find those people who find glasses, uh, quite attractive? I assume because of how the frame and magnify the eyes, which I find quite pretty. Everybody was just like, eh. Uh, no, yeah, I wear glasses. Um, most of the time I wear contacts when I'm out and about, but I wear them at home. Because I just don't feel like sitting here with my eyes drying out. And then most of the time I accidentally fall asleep wearing them. But with my glasses, I, um, you know, obviously take them off my face. It's funny. Because I used to complain about not being able to see even sitting in the front row at like school. My mom like just like never believed me. And then they finally took me to the eye doctor and they're like, oh yeah, her vision, not good. And it's like, I don't even, like my parents have like 20, 20 vision. Not a lot of people wear glasses in my family. They're getting older now, so they have to wear readers, but like, I think like only like my uncle and my dad's side has to wear glasses. And I'm like, what the hell? Mom? Is there something you need to tell me? No, I'm kidding. If you saw me and my dad, you'd be like, oh, that's copy paste. Uh, she just has titties. Um, and is a woman and I'm cute. I don't look like a man, I promise. Um, how much grade do you use? It's not that bad. I'm like, hold on, I have to remember. Fuck, what is my prescription? I'm like negative 0.25 in one eye and then 0.2 in the other or 0.3 in one eye and 0.3, 0.5 in the other. So like, I'm not going to lie to you. I used to have a really, like when I was younger, I was born with fucking googly eyes. My dad used to call me like, call me fucking googly eyes, essentially, because I had a really bad lazy eye and moved to the side. I don't wear patches, kid. So I was a pirate. Um, it was corrected, but I can control it now. So I can make my eye go like really, uh, really fucking like lazy. And be like, hey, and then I always do that to people. Like I would do that to my coworkers in the middle of talking to them and they'd like freak out because my eye just like slowly drips away. Um, but my mom, my mom's, my mom's just like, oh yeah, you fucking hated the iPad, you would take it off and stick to the TV. And then you just keep watching TV. But then she's like, it didn't make sense because then you couldn't see past the sticker and you would complain you couldn't see with it all. Oh my God. I don't have to tell you, mom. Lazy Susan type beat. Um, just sort of wore a second eye patch under the first one. Um, yeah, that was like when I was like, like five or six or seven though, I can't remember. I don't, I like, I generally don't even remember wearing one. It was only like, I only know that I had one from like pictures of when I was super young. I'm like, I don't even remember that. Um, no, but it wasn't even, it wasn't an eye patch. It was like a little sticker you literally go over your eye with. Like it's like a little, like it's just a giant fucking sticker for your face. And you just smack it on. It's not like, so there could have been a second mercy. Um, I actually did do that thing. I would actually cover my eye a lot so I could see in the dark. I would, uh, I would do that. I would a hundred percent do that. I was such a fucking shooting kid. You have no fucking idea doing Naruto hand signs running around like, like a fucking ninja. I was so, I'm surprised. My parents didn't get me locked up with how delusional I was. She be demon. I, yeah, it was my, that was my demon. I'm my lazy. I was my demon. I, I can't even, I can't even remember which one is like, was my lazy. I think it's the one that was, that has a higher, um, or technically a lower, like prescription or whatever. Our prescription. Believe it. Can we get some of the Chuni back now? You got mercy for that. She's a Chuni. I'm no longer a Chuni. I'm such a fucking normie now. Like, uh, I used to be the hugest weeb in Korea boo. Um, I was a weeaboo and a Korea boo in the worst way. I was singing in Japanese. I mean, my friend would talk to each other in Japanese. I actually knew a lot of Japanese. Uh, my Japanese name was like Mitsuko word of the fuck. Um, we refer to that. We would pass notes in Japanese. Um, we would pretend we were, uh, anime characters all the time. Uh, we talk in those stupid ass voices. Like, oh my God. So you discovered my secret power. She has no idea what's going to hit her. Ah. Should be got a real job. I know. Yeah. I know. I really, I actually, like my job, like actually spoke Japanese pretty well. And, um, I can actually, I'm very good at picking up on like accent and how to say something. Um, I have a lot of, uh, Chinese customers and they would teach me Mandarin. Some of them would teach me Cantonese and they would like say a word and I would just repeat it to them. And they're like, Hey, that was actually pretty good. I'm like, yay. Oh, you need to be, um, yeah. Yeah. Oh, she was great. I missed her. I haven't seen her in years. Uh, I remember I tried reaching out to her, but it just like got no word back. Like, you know, like people just go to college and they drift away. Like that's, that's just kind of what happened. Um, but I bet she's, I bet she's like prospering out there somewhere. She was, she was a really talented artist. I'll tell you that she was, she's probably like some fucking big animator right now. I would not be surprised. Um, super fucking talented. Redacted. If you're watching this, I miss you. You know, you are. Kiri and Muda forever. She be Chunibom. You know, there's me who goes through a friend every month for not really figuring out who I vibe with. Um, honestly, I would. I imagine she's just, that'd be crazy. Uh, no, they do not have the same art style because she has a very distinct art style. Um, uh, that, I feel like that has to do more with you than it actually has to do with the people that you're hanging out with. Um, because you have to, you don't want to be friends with the saint. Like, because my friends are totally different from me. Totally different. Um, hello. Welcome back. Um, she was a tough over. Um, give people a chance. Make sure you get to know them. Uh, you don't make friendships in a month. And sometimes you just have the personality traits of just like kind of just being an introvert and that's okay. You can have acquaintances. You don't have to be friends with people, you know. Yeah. I could change your group. Yeah. Yeah. No, thank you. Um, different races, different backgrounds, different cultures, uh, different levels of baseness. You got me in the middle. You got olive at the beginning and you got Salem way. Fucking bass is fuck. Um, and then like I have other friends who are like married. I have friends who have like kids. I have friends like, so it's like, it's so good to surround yourself with people that are so much different from you because you will learn so much from them. Yeah, you don't have to be like, I like, I would say olive and Salem, um, are my best friends and I would die for them. And then I have like friends from work where they're like, I'm not going to like go out of my way to hang out with you. I'm not going to like, if you can, if you have some fucking car trouble, come and pick you up because that's like the good thing to do. Um, but like, I don't really want to hear about how some dude broke up with you and you're just like, because again, I'm so fucking nice and people just tell me their entire life stories and I just have to like compartmentalize that and took it behind me and just be like, yeah, okay. And then I just moved on with my life. It was a pony roll point. What an RP group that lasted four years. Hey, man, I was in a lot of RP groups. I was in both RP groups. So don't even get me started. Oh, wiki foundry and wet paint forever. Black bloods, black bloods. Sorry. Black bloods back. That's back. Um, Sasuke Itachi, itachi can't get heartbroken if you've never dated. Oh, sweetheart. Oh, sweetheart. I'll be honest with you. Girls are very fucking brutal. Uh, and then confidence is a thing like you have to, you know, work on your own like self-love and all that stuff. Because sometimes you feel like you're unlovable because you don't love yourself yet, you know. Uh, and yeah, you can get heartbroken even if you never dated. You're right. I've gotten heartbroken after fucking anime characters. I've gotten heartbroken over, you know, having a like a whiplash for a Vtuber. I watched. I totally get that. I get it. I get it. I've never been rejected. Uh, I would go out of my way to get rejected. I don't mean to like guys or whatever. I mean, just like in general, like, hey, can I have this job? Can I do this? Because when you get rejected so often, you become used to it. And, um, it doesn't scare you as much to me. Like you realize you can survive after being rejected. I also, again, I grew up a very religious conservative girl. If I looked at a boy, I thought I was going to fucking go to hell. I remember I got some heartbroken one time. I was physically ill. Oh, you sweet thing. You're helping with confidence. You know, she'd be, I'm glad. I'm glad I can help you guys with confidence. I like, again, I remember some of the messages you guys sent me. You're like, oh, I really liked your aftercare and your ASMR role play. It really actually, like I talk to myself and I say good things about myself in the mirror. I'm trying to eat better and go to the gym. Um, yeah, it all, first, um, it all starts with, uh, your mindset and, you know, kind of learning with yourself. So, okay, I'm going to be, I'm going to be really weird with you for a second. You don't have to do this, by the way. It's just like what I found was good for me in a good tool, uh, one therapy, but two. Um, so there is something in like the witchy community and it's called, uh, your shadow self. And that's the self that you kind of push down and it's like, you know, hidden in the shadows, so to speak. And you don't really like to acknowledge it. And how you do, like, you can look up like shadow journaling and it kind of gives you a prompt where you have to kind of confront that shadowy aspect of yourself. Um, because I remember I had like a really toxic friend and she was like a horrible even being to me and I just did not have the power to tell her like I can't be friends with you because I was such a pushover at the time. So I sat down with myself and I'm like, what am I getting out of this relationship? What am I, I'm not gaining anything from being friends with this person who just pushes me around, uses me only for like when I have money and she wants me to buy or something. Like what the. And then just like blows me off for her other friends and then talk shit behind my back. Like what are you going to know? And then I was just, I came down to I'm like, I didn't like myself. That's the shadow part was I didn't like who I was and I thought that I deserved that sort of treatment, but you have to realize you don't. Yeah, shadow work. Yeah. You guys know what shadow work? Yeah, shadow. I fought my demons. I shadow box my demons. I on it like and that's and you don't have to put it in that frame of like, oh, which you should like honestly shadow work is very similar to like normal as someone who like I actively go to therapy who just journaling in general, such a good outlet. So I always say work on your mental and then find a hobby that is a good outlet for you. That's going for the gym, go to the gym for me. I was doing jiu-jitsu. I'm currently not able to do that right now because of my injuries. So it became video games for a little bit and then it became vTubing vTubing is such a good outlet for me. I can rage at video games. I can talk to you guys. I can do fun stuff on my own. So it's it's good and I can make my friends. It's a great outlet for me. It's a great hobby. Um, I also I'm currently working on trying to get a more active hobby now that it's nice and sunny outside and all that shit. So I'm going to try to go like hiking again and whatever, um, very Jungian concept. Yeah. That's kind of true actually. Jordan Pierce in shorts. Um, and yeah, it is cathartic. It's literally like this is almost like therapy for me because like I talked to you guys how I talk to my therapist sometimes just in the frame of like, Oh, this is how I'm feeling this week. Um, I've been stressed out. Like I was telling my therapist, like all these eyes are on me. I don't feel like I'm like we're currently we're working through my posture syndrome. Um, but she's on a vacation for two weeks in Europe and I don't know what, but so you guys are my therapist. I'm sorry. Sorry guys. I'm going to cry to you instead. Um, yeah, we can tell as I can't tell what the context of that was, um, don't take your meds. Dude, no, uh, if I didn't take my meds, I would never leave my house. It's not fun being a gorophobic man. It's really not. I don't recommend it. I only get bad advice. Give us your tears. Um, collective shoulders can hold a lot of tears teasing material for later. She is a therapist and takes her meds like a good girl. Um, no, it's cause I'm a fucking adult and I am not self-destructive. That is teenager. No, thank you. Um, I'm a grown ass woman. Uh, yeah, I have like, don't, don't get it twisted. I have my Manhattan moments, um, but I almost do like act upon my more Manhattan moments because I know I'm in a like safe space in the community where it's expected for that to open up. She's being a woman. Uh, whatever. But like, I haven't even really had that yet. I'm like, because of, I've thought of like, I like had like a negative thought the other day about streaming. I don't even remember what it was, but I'm like, normally I would like vent about this on my all. And I'm like, I don't have to do that. I don't have to do that. Yes. I have. Okay. What was my Manhattan moment? Let me know. I'll, I'll give you this one shot right here on my cheek. I'm leaning in at me right here. She's so female. He's so foreign. My marinara moments. What is Manhattan? Uh, Manhattan is a Japanese, uh, close deal term, uh, in the v-tubeing community for essentially crazy person or someone who kind of like acts out a lot it doesn't have like any impulse control kind of just like breaks down and kind of like loses it often like for example if i like imagine if i instead of having like this productive talk with you i went on on my all and i cried and i said everybody hates me i hate being a dumb um fuck all of you i'm never doing this again i'm crying you guys suck i'm going to do this i'm going to that to myself because i hate you and you guys make me feel terrible that's a manhara moment acting challenge go go jebus manhara equals meltdown yeah essentially we can't handle you at your worst you don't deserve you at your best shiboni moments get it

nice if like because i've heard that before like someone's like i found my wife watching your streams and then you guys can get laid and like you know you can do btsm shit on each other and then you

commune in a cult we're gonna be the second jones town i'm kidding i'm kidding i'm kidding i'm kidding um i still have to really pee i haven't peed in like several hours wow i am quite the endurance streamer aren't i um i've never watched vtubers before but i clicked on one of your streams out of curiosity and now i'm lurking in all your streams i'm quite shy so i don't chat much during live streams but i wanted to say i really enjoy your content um i'll pause there there's a lot more thank you if you lurk thank you you don't have to talk in my streams if you don't feel comfortable i appreciate uh that you just like want to hang out watch me listen to me maybe have me in the background i love my lurkers lurkers are amazing um it's also hectic if like a hundred people talking chat but yeah uh but welcome welcome to vtubers uh it's quite a wild ride but it's really cool and fun you'll soon discover uh i like how blunt and honest you are it makes you feel like more of a person than most of the other vtubers i've heard of i've been going through a rough patch lately and your streams have been helping i'm afraid i'm becoming parasocial oh i don't know if this is a bad thing or not all i know is that's generally not advice do you have any advice how to prevent this if not then that's fine thanks for being chill the chillimeters app off the charts um i can't really stop you for being parasocial um um you have to understand that i'm trying to say this nicely it's gonna i think most people are pretty understanding that like i'm probably i'm never gonna meet you in person um we're never gonna hang out together um and i'm sorry that's not a possibility but it's for everybody's safety um and mental well-being so nobody gets hurt uh i totally understand i've also been parasocial with streamers before flesh tubers and vtubers alike uh i used to have dreams that pewdiepie actually knew me and gave me a shout out on his main channel and i'll have continuances of dreams where i run into him again um and in my dream i'm just like he's like and i'm like an old friend of his i've never fucking met the dude i've never talked to him i don't even know i had those dreams i haven't watched pewdiepie in years but like sometimes one of those will just pop up and i'm just like what the fuck because i really liked him as a creator i would watch him when i came home from school at the time so i get it uh pewds got me through a lot of shit in markiplier, jacksepticeye and like game grumps and fucking van os's crew and all that shit i watched a lot of youtube growing up because i didn't have any fucking friends so i get it it's hard not to develop friendship feelings or otherwise what the people you watch especially if you really enjoy their personality um i always said my goal was to be a content creator that you felt like you could come home to and sit down and watch and like just kind of unwind after a long day and like you're hanging out with an old friend playing video games and chatting with them that was kind of my goal um but like i know that's probably really a little bit problematic now given like vtubers are kind of again a little bit more parasocial because you can't see me it's hard to remember them a human being sometimes and you know i can't really blame you for that uh at all actually like i totally get it like i sometimes will watch a streamer and i'm like yes they are this type of cat girl yes totally like you get caught up on it i can't blame you can you be parasocial with your cats that's fine bro if i were able to sample any of richie b s*** for my rap music that'd be phenomenal this talking spectacularly because how much it relates to that very similarity for other streamers yeah honestly i give you permission for that um i has cupcake yeah ld shadow lady oh my god yeah 100% like i watched markiplier um the most right and actually no game grumps i watched the most and i literally if i'm i'll have him in the background and i feel like i have like two of my older brothers hanging out with me uh playing f***ing resident evil giggling over lady dibertresque and i'm just giggling while i'm cleaning my room cleaning the house doing this putting on my makeup and it's like i get it i totally get it um but then you at the end of the day you have to remember watch real what's not but i feel like a lot of my viewers are pretty uh like they kind of are self-aware and they're like oh my god i'm falling in love with her that's fine well like i don't want to hurt you i'll hurt you physically like you know like i don't want to oh my god i'm literally tearing up because like i don't want to break anybody's heart i don't want to break anybody's f***ing heart man because it sucks having your heart broken because you can't be with someone so i f***ing get it like i'm not gonna discourage it but i don't really yeah i don't know what else to say like i can't stop you i can't yeah it's an inevitable if i discourage or not but i almost don't want to like i can't i don't really discourage it because like there is i i kind of think that like being parasocial is a spectrum you have people in one end that are like this is a cool streamer i watch and then you have other people get it and they're like i am actually married to them um and i just want to be in the middle where you're i'm a streamer you watch you like and you can enjoy me but you just understand you know like you just be realistic and it sucks because like i'm a major f***ing people pleaser and i want to make you all happy i don't want to break people's heart um but i can't tell you not to love me i can't tell you not to like want to be my friend because i understand it i watch so many female vtubers and i'm like oh my god i wish i could be their friend it sucks because i know when i'll ever be even being a streamer now like i'm like i'll never be their friend you know even it sucks i love you too much for the middle i'm not even in this for the hornet i just want to watch someone who isn't restricting what they say or do that's fine too um yeah that's me though i know like emi and isi are f***ing hella parasocial with you guys oh my god they f***ing love you guys you'd have no idea and mercy too oh my god is there a little bit she's like a little bit laid back about it though um isi's in love with y'all if you're gonna f***ing hunt you down parasocial responsibility kids yeah exactly i just don't want anybody to get like hurt over me you know and i think that's kind of also what it's like being a dom because when you're a dominatrix and you have clients and they come in and they ask for they have certain requests and you fulfill those requests at the end of the day it's a different type of relationship and that's the relationship i want to have with you i want you to feel safe with me i want you to feel you know protected with me i want you to feel like you can go fulfill fantasies with me and if some of those fantasies have to do with be with you loving me that's like that's okay i don't mind being loved i don't mind being loved at all it's called codependence yeah codependence oh should i nuke this vod i'm getting too f***ing emotional right now i'm so lonely he cries profusely um i'm also saying this for myself because i don't want to get too caught up i'm a very um um what i love i love very deeply so i also don't want to get my heart broken ah f*** emotions uh i still have to really pee i know i just like i i get so shy sometimes and i'm like i have to destroy every vod inside i need to start over i mean because i have this like i want people to have this image of me but i'm like no like let me just show them my real self i'm working on it sorry for destroying vod

that are you saying your names okay some of you are getting bonus names rends the clips you clip in rends the clips delusion green enigma dragon he's nuts across your face come come he's up you know it'd be a funny like stream idea is like try to keep up with chat and read everything they say read every sentence and you can't skip but you have to read it as fast as chat is moving big fan of delusion fast firing engagement i'd be modig and schlicken if you blow up to like 1k viewers it would be so it would be impossible yeah it's actually sometimes it's hard to follow chat i kind of like i prefer having a small ccv because i can keep up with chat when we first like had our second like the 2.0 stream and we did have around like 900 people uh consecutively watching us and trying to keep up with chat was a nightmare i was like actually like between that and then heading 17k on my twitter i was kind of heartbroken because it was really hard to interact with you guys like because i couldn't i liked liking a lot of your tweets to show you that i like liked it and you know read them and stuff and now it's almost impossible for me to do that on twitter because i just get so many fucking notifications from people liking all the porn that i retweet mentioned the hauling girls yeah that's why i'm like i don't think it could be one because of how i am uh in haul live just because like i don't like the fact that some people because they're so large start to see their audience as a number rather than individuals and i never want to feel that and i felt it when i hit 17k on my haul and it sucked because i'm like i'm just looking at a number and i liked it when it was way smaller because it's weird and i know it's mostly bots thank god like i think actually knowing that it's mostly bots kind of make me felt better because i'm like okay there's still a couple like humans i can interact with they're still individuals they're still like it's because of me overwhelming yeah it's a lot of bots i wish i could purge them i really wish i could purge them but i don't want to accidentally purge like people who are normal uh oh i'm getting eepy i need to wash my face and i put on makeup today gross i'm trying i went to a dermatologist because i just like have been breaking out really fucking bad and even before like streaming and stuff um because it's not like stress related um and they're just like oh you you have like a hormone imbalance and i'm like what the fuck because like um so like i have a lot of like issues um so i have to be on birth control um and birth control can fuck with your hormones and that's another reason like that's why i sometimes have to take like mental uh medication and other medication but like it also regulates other parts that would get fucked up otherwise if i didn't take it and so it's like the lesser of two evils is that i get fucking acne or i go i go batshit crazy so i'd rather just get acne oh just breed me instead that's pretty common yeah like a lot of and like because i get really like tmi if you don't like to hear about like blood or periods please click off um i used to get really horrible painful like feeling i'm stabbed in the fucking uterus um cramps i had to go to urgent care before uh the way i was describing it my mom felt like i had like some sort what is it called like we have it it's not like a cis like a non nodule there's like a like one of like an over exploded or whatever the fuck but it was really it was just pain it was just pain i've grown up a woman this is a Tuesday for me uh no i but i don't have endo like i don't have endo um they do they do think i have polycystic ovary syndrome um but they're still trying to figure it out that's why i've been going to the doctor's appointments um i hate being a fucking woman uh there's so much fucking shit um because like they didn't ultrasound on me and they didn't see anything physical but then my endocrinologist was telling me that like it can like you can still have it and not have actual assists which i didn't know that um but yeah it was like i would have like really fucking heavy periods just bleed through super pads like i'm if you're a guy you probably don't know or maybe you have a sister maybe you do know or a girlfriend or whatever um but like a super pad is like a different thickness it's because like uh it's not it's not i'm going to the i'm going to the pharmacy uh you need tampons but your pussy size no it's like it's not like large and like super isn't like a super huge pussy it's it's like the flow and what it can hold um so when you have a really heavy flow usually you have to get like supers um so i would do that and i would bleed through them real fast i'm so sorry if this grosses you out i'm so sorry i'm so so so sorry um but uh yeah it just like really fucking sucks um and then my yeah i'm like i was gonna describe some more symptoms i'm like never mind but um supersize me um i remember like my mom uh telling my dad to go get tampons for the both of us and my dad was like uh he's like you're my wife it's fine but like this is weird he's like why can't we just have sons and i'm like hey i'm like hi my girl it's because like it's so because it's like your kid is growing up you know he was just like i don't know it's i don't know how to deal with this but like my dad has a younger sister too like i haven't on but like they are so far apart in age that my dad's is like what i remember like really conservators religious households so like sex education is not a huge thing but like i think i think my mom educated my dad pretty well i'm gonna get a hormonal cycle so simple yeah i hate like going through like pms like just like being upset maybe that maybe i'm pmsing although like what you're really knowing about being on birth control is that i'm irregular so i don't really like i don't know what the fuck i'm gonna get it just happens um yeah men have a hormonal cycle i think it like takes place through a day but for women it's it's a we have a month long hormonal cycle yeah yeah men's is daily um and then for yeah for women it's like we have like you know before we get it we have like ovulation right before we get it period then like the time after that and then like maybe like a fucking day or two of rest and then it's like ovulation and then yeah it usually happens when you sleep that's why you wake up fucking shooting everywhere okay why why are all the men surprised that they have a hormonal cycle guys look you got yeah you guys have a hormonal cycle how do you think your body regulates the t an estrogen in your body you guys never knew that men have a horn that's wow yeah you guys yeah you're just just a lot shorter but that's like yeah there's that's a sometimes um that's why men can kind of freak out when their t levels are low or it's like there's a there's a or you actually don't have enough estrogen in your body because remember men and women both make estrogen um just yeah because then we just both have different levels of it so you have two less you're like more likely to have certain behaviors vice versa and stuff it's just part of the fucking it out process doesn't really change for us yeah it's like it's not drastic for you guys like it is for women so then again we don't bleed from our privates each month yeah i feel like i've always said and like all the girls joke about this like um if men had the same sort of hormonal cycles as women did there would be like so much difference in like how those are treated because like if you imagine you were like kicked in the nuts for like at least like at maximum eight days like wouldn't you want a day off but like you don't get a day off for that you don't get a day off for having like the first day of your period is the fucking worst well like one get well not not like in a good way like if it like surprises you not like when you're expecting it in like a horny way can't go to work my peepee hurt that's true i'm thinking like one no continuous kicks wait has any of you had like a kidney stone have any like had a kidney stone or like a really like really bad constipation i'm like trying to find an equivalent for you to understand no drink water the pain of a period it is not like this is like women have like women have a higher pain tolerance than men and you guys should totally testicular torsion um like i know there is like those like simulators you can do where you can put them on on a guy and it will like stimulate either like childbirth or a cramp i love watching those videos i remember they did it for like i think it's i want to take talk of like a cop did it and they turned it up to a 10 and he was like on the ground the cop and then they they put it on a woman and she was just like oh yeah that's really fucking hurts but she was like just like standing and looking around she was like fine how would a guy want that because it's just you don't have to want that but it's like it's i think it would make men a lot more empathetic would you guys would you take care of me if i was on my period and i wasn't feeling good pissing a stone was the most painful thing i've experienced yeah my my dad my dad's diabetic so he's more apt to get to these stones um and my dad's like is this what giving birth is like to my mom and mom's like no it's worse imagine if you were torn from asshole to vagina you drink the blood you're gonna earn your red wings now i don't want to be the simulator's i'm good i stick with empathy no sympathy needed i'm into the store for your ultra pads but um no i don't like i might thankfully because like again so this was before i was on birth control now that i'm on birth control i barely have a period i live in life except now i fucking zits and like normally when you're my age you don't have acne anymore so i usually maintain it with skincare um and i didn't because i'm stupid i like finally went to the dermatologist because my doctor was just like whoa like you like what's happened and like i don't have like bad acne um it's more like again i've said because i'm melanated my skin will scar if i'm wearing makeup you can't even fucking tell but like if you were looking at me with that makeup i have like a lot of like um like dark spots on my face like they almost look like freckles and um but like or like the beauty marks on my face um and my doctor's like yeah no that shouldn't be doing that and so i went to the dermatologist they're like oh yeah your hormones are like really thrown off by your um your birth control so like we're gonna like put you on this and it actually helps like regulate it i'm like this entire fucking time i've been on this for a year and i could have why didn't you guys tell me this sooner they're like well you shouldn't have a side effects i'm like fuck you do pimple patches help yes they do a lot actually yeah hyperpigmentation i get hyperpigmentation and because i have dermatillomania it's fucking annoying or excorciation disorder whatever it's called it's like it's almost like a form of ocd where you have like i can't really explain it you can just google it um you think emi likes picket scabs you haven't met me yet um i fuck gore to he moment doctor moment okay richie guy i can just get a grow beer to hide him yeah like i always say beer just like the makeup for men but like again i look um i just look like i have a lot of fucking freckles on my face um and usually they get mistaken because i'll like i'll go out with no makeup i don't give a shit um and people just like think i just have a lot of freckles or beauty marks um and then if i really want to i'll just put like foundation on and it's gone i hate having to shave every other day yeah i can't relate besides like i'll get like a couple of peach fuzzies actually like the other day i got like one like chin hair and i was like oh my fucking god what the fuck is this what's going on in my face my mom's like oh yeah they have to be around your age i'm like what am i am i mutating but i just plucked it and i'm fine and i haven't seen it since before without a beard before i lost weight it looked like a thumb oh like a thumb from like spy kids or if i try to grow beard looks like pubes and i don't know those words oh i know like i a lot of my co-workers who are younger than me um some of them are guys and they can't grow beards and like again like men and women have like different like gripes with things like guys worry about their fucking dick size or whatever and then growing beards and then women worry about like literally every aspect of their fucking body yeah and so um uh like so i really i try to empathize with men because i'm like oh i'm gonna have it easy but i'm like no you know no they kind of don't because like i'm not a boy so i don't know kind of like i i recently figured out how rudely men treat each other based on appearance or like how they carry themselves and i thought it was a joke but i was like listening to um what was it no this wasn't recently it was actually like months ago what the fuck i'm talking about before leave um one of my co-workers because i i'm uh you know i'm a nosy bitch don't forget gemini moon um and i was overhearing my uh male co-workers talk about a group chat and like they were like roasting this kid in it and i was like holy fucking shit jesus fucking christ why do you have him in there if you're just gonna shit on him um so like and they were like yeah they're making fun of his appearance or that he spoke this and that and i'm like wow they're just as bad as girls so like i i definitely uh it kind of like threw some sympathy at me there so like when i went guys complain like oh i can't really grow a beard that well or i'm this or that i'm like you know i get it we just have females have a different equivalent of that you know no that's pretty random behavior with the g's yeah or just like um men having a sort of like kind of like what is the word i want to use it's like dick measuring contest like you have to like prove yourself i don't know i've just observed that i feel like you guys are like kind of passive aggressive sometimes in friend groups early yeah like men friendships are very interesting because i'm like do you guys actually like each other because you're like making fun of each other you're calling each other you're doing this you're doing that hegemonic masculinity but then i see the but then like you're all like gay as fuck i'm like are you guys gonna make out or like are you touching him on the ass like that and i'm like looking at my co-workers i'm like is he gay i'm like oh no he's not gay he's just hanging out with his friends i guess i don't it's called the bromance oh that's true bromance i love you in the most heterosexual way from like ryan hega guys are very interesting like how they like i'm i'm sorry but i've been like studying you like i'm a fucking weirdo i'm just like what the fuck like why are they like like it's so weird so weird like before i went on my medical leave um because again i'm a i'm a mentor to a lot of the people in my store um and it is a male dominated field so a lot of uh gentlemen are not like i'm in their superior and so they'll come to me and talk to about stuff and be like oh this girl or this guy and our friends and then this happened and then this happened and i'm like why the why don't you guys just talk about your feelings and then just like oh we don't do that we're guys and i'm like oh that's a good point you guys never really talk about your real feelings it's kind of like it's kind of like superficial and i don't know why like i don't excuse me you should excuse me um have feel like you can have a safe space to talk to your bros about how you feel like i'm like i'm sitting and listening to this kid tell me about his parents divorce and i'm like i don't know you that well one two you have like your boys are in the corner over there you could go talk to them about it not that i like i'm not gonna like not listen to you but i'm like why are you but then i realize that maybe it maybe it is a cultural thing maybe it is like a make american cultural thing like you have to be tough and you have to have this air that like you don't have feelings and stuff and it makes me really sad like i want you to be able to talk about your feelings men should be able to talk about their fucking feelings especially your feelings for me you can't see but i like did the cute like tuck my hair behind the ear fending happens in brazil too yeah i feel like it's a cultural thing but you're not weak feelings are a fucking normal thing honestly for me when a guy shows his feelings it shows me a sense of maturity because you're in touch with yourself you touch yourself to me um uh you're kind of i don't know i feel like it makes you more open-minded um secret secret for you if you have a girlfriend or if you want one talk about your feelings but don't be weird about it being able to talk about your feelings and be vulnerable is a sign of strength in my opinion exactly i got that cry and riz um yeah not from the get-go don't just like you know chill like everybody else and then when you get closer and you're like wow i really like this person then you can be like hey i wasn't feeling so good today because you said this to me and it kind of hurt my feelings and if the girl immediately starts bitching at you that like oh i wouldn't ever tell her to shut the fuck up and leave her sorry i like playing therapist and being a big sis slash mom sometimes i don't know i just i just like helping people out gotta wait till a few drinks get into no no you don't fucking get drunk and share your feelings because then it just sounds like word vomit and creepy took that advice to heart to almost be her girlfriend i think at the ick they're not the right person precisely is it a therapist or she'd be spitting facts we have to ask more details to start taking potshots of who i was subconsciously inspired by yeah it's hard because i know for guys because women can be really bitchy like they can be catty um not all women but women sometimes they will be passive aggressive and they will use things you've said to them against you and if that happens leave because they do not care about your feelings if they're taking really low blows and shots women know how to hit you or it hurts sometimes and some men too some men i was watching this like tiktok of these women who it was like pop a balloon if you want to if you don't want to date this guy and it was this like really uh arrogant like dentist doctor and so they go to interview the first woman and they're like hey so like why did you pop your balloon like why don't you want to date him and she's like you know he came across this really arrogant i don't really think that's appropriate i feel like this this and this and the first thing he said to her was just like who did your teeth because they don't look good and like that's how he responded he didn't be like oh i'm sorry you feel that way but i'm going to rebuttal with a valid point insert point here like he just responded the most dickish way and it's like for every woman that popped their balloon and like let me tell you like they nicely explained why they weren't attracted to him like one woman said um i feel like your arrogance because you come up this is like there's a difference between confidence and arrogance and i feel like your arrogance against would get in the way of you loving me she's like i would be able to love you but i don't think you'd have enough room to love me and then and she and then she like made some sort of um i think like illusion i can't remember the english term like she made like a like an illustration of um not like a physical illustration but like you know what i'm trying to say um turn to an a yeah like a metaphor of like giving pieces of like her love in a box and him not being able to like have it and then he illusion was right okay and then he was immediately set like essentially just started calling her crazy and gaslighting her it was just like um well he said like i really hear and understand you know get where you're coming from but the way you said that did not make any sense this and this and this and he was like trying to pick apart argument instead of just being like no i think i would actually you know have be confident and then be able to have love for somebody and i was like this dude fucking sucks uh my headphones died so i can't hear 33 cents feeling better thank you mr tony is as based as ever either head off for class it's been interesting good have a good time at class pay attention do good in school get those grades up kiddo but yeah there are guys like oh like if i find the clip i will show it to you guys like i'll retweet it on my all and be like i hope you're not like this because i was like wow and mind you these are like gorgeous women and he and he was a nice looking guy but then like you realize like as he's talking like oh he's an ugly man on the inside though but so like it's true like men can also be really passive aggressive and kind of pull out stuff that you wouldn't expect those both sides human beings just suck that's why i have three cats lonely i'm so lonely didn't you try to mainsplain yeah self-walk yes yes that's exactly what i'm talking about um it's like these these black women these black this black dude is this a local no people just mean regardless of gender yeah surrender for yourself a good friends and chat yeah a hundred hundred percent everybody yeah then nobody nobody escapes that guys do i have to like respond to every marrow because i do not feel like it i might just like heart all of them and then call it a day for these marrows i don't think i want to type everything out i'll leave the vault up go pee oh peace i'll pee in a second go piss girl but like i'm happy i hope we had like a productive chat i'm sorry if like me being super honest with you and stuff puts you off i understand i know some people don't like me cries um because i tend to overshare and yeah and i was like uh he's talking about a period with the fuck girl gross i know i know you have you guys enjoy the yapping but i mean like sometimes the the subject matter in which i talk about it people don't like what i like about you chibi you just did a full workshop fat did i really holy fuck dude what the fuck is wrong with me sometime gets you thinking i like people to be introspective i don't you know i like philosophy a lot just kind of like think about human nature and all that shit casual seven-hour yapathon i mean if it's controversial something like that a tit trigger warning or content warning wouldn't hurt but like i don't i think we're all adults here and if you hear something you don't like you just leave i shouldn't have to be like trigger warning i'm talking about blood i don't i'm sorry i'm not gonna we're adults i'm not gonna hold your hand for that stuff and then like oh if it's like really bad like when we were doing like the class of 09 stuff i knew was gonna be edgy so i'm like disclaimer there's gonna be edgy stuff this probably isn't the stream for you but that's like immediately when i started stream but like and i did say like guys tmi i'm about to talk about like periods and stuff so like i didn't preface it and i do usually preface just like kind of subconsciously say it out loud to you guys like oh i might talk about something you not like might not like in the next five seconds she be made for the sake of the future we should have a rule stating we're 18 plus stream i think that's a given why should i make why should i have a rule saying i'm an 18 plus stream when it's obvious i'm an 18 plus streamer you know like i mean all right you know not to youtube jannies it isn't they probably yank it if i said that you should be have you ever considered playing elden ring might be fun i'm not sure if you're interested in soul series yeah my cat's not named via or anything yeah i fucking love elden ring dude i'm probably not gonna play it though on stream uh i know strani's playing it soon 18 plus i thought that you were 17.9 jesus it's already known because can you people get me if it happens it happens if i need to then i will i'm not gonna do that though that's just silly like i think it's obvious from my content when you look at my description uh in the you know description box below and on my twitter and especially on my alt that i'm 18 plus look at my fucking outfit dude look at my outfit do you think i'm user friendly do you think this is the reason why i haven't been monetized yet you need to finish up elden ring for the dlc right youtube hates her look very innocent i'm so innocent i'm so innocent you like you like my innocence what's my alt nobody tell him i thought you were chill bro get the fuck out of here great to finally meet shibi i love your model and the club you're hella stunning oh thank you me too i just i want you guys to have your emotes and like i just want to do membership streams man i want to do the you know the monetization celebration stream that's all i want well she just had a brainer account content is educational and health and medicine paces she's good that's true i can literally just switch the thing on this and be like it is educational because it is we're not talking like i'm literally actually being very educational right now am i not give us that emotes youtube i'm like sticking oh right oh right oh she's stepping on my bladder there's no alton bossing say you don't want the money you just want the celebration stream yeah pretty much like the money's like i'm not good i'm not gonna lie to you money's nice again i said if i ever i would not be able to go full time as a streamer unless i relied on you know you for donations and support and watching me like i'm not gonna fucking pretend like i don't care about money whatsoever i need to feed my kitties but i am always super fucking thankful anytime someone does i got a toot i'm afraid if i toot i'll pee because i peed a little when i tooted already i don't want to toot again always my favorite boss in eldering hmm does it have to be like one of the main bosses or does it have to kind of be like one of the mini bosses because then i was gonna say the uh what's that fucking thing that jumps around fucking piss me the fuck off i was so happy when i killed it it's like the night star fallen thing and you break everything as like a scorpion tail no it wasn't astell was it the whiteboard no it wasn't astell it was like it was almost like a horse that would jump around yeah the meteor beast actually really like the design of that the fallen star beast was actually really beautiful no i wasn't thinking the falling star beast i'm thinking i was thinking of the one that looks like a deer for a second um but the falling star beast yes was my favorite um and then the deer one was also really gorgeous is what i meant to say the ancestor spirit in terms of looks hell yeah um astell yeah i was fine um elton dragon monster the ender dragon was pretty cool as well radigan damn fucking radigan i'm in love with radigan radigan america who is pretty i just long-haired gingers and also when they're falling apart and like leaking gold and shit it's pretty sick general adon it took me forever to beat radon because i was so one it was like this is that was elton ring was like the second from soft game i played um and so i didn't know how to approach anything and then i can't like i didn't know any strats like to defeat radon and i couldn't even like then i looked up like walkthroughs but like how to fight him then i found like oh you can like cheese like boss i was like what the fuck is teasing and i just figured out what it was um and then i couldn't even cheese radon properly i was so fucking shit but then literally after i beat him i like honestly everything changed when i got the black knife i can't lie i fucking abused the use of the black knife i'm not good at games i just i don't play games skillfully i am just smart figured you can use some of the weapons as terrain to eat oh yeah no yeah i knew that wonk play style what build did you use an elton ring uh i used a again i haven't played elton ring like a year so i can't remember a lot but i didn't mean to do that um what is it called it was blood build i actually i was like a blood and faith build and i used a lot of arcane too i didn't use rivers of blood i actually used the um the halo scythe a lot i used halo scythe the black knife i started off as a confessor because i literally just picked one i didn't know what the fuck to scale with i didn't know how things scaled i literally elton ring is the first game i like actively did so much fucking research on all the fucking lore i watched about it all about like the how the weapons scaled jesus christ i'm like i'm doing math what am i doing oh yeah use the dragon incantations yeah oh what the fuck did i just step on oh boomie what the hell what are you doing down there oh we're just hanging out yeah so it was like a faith blood build oh my god i got two please don't pee i did not pee we're good and he cools breath for the scarlet raw it was clutched so often yeah i did use that drank this faith yeah fancy flame should be base clutching button yeah uh i would probably i don't want to embarrass myself by playing other ring online i mean like on stream i mean after strani does because strani is like such a fucking good gamer she like hundred percent shit and i'm like looking at her watching her streams i'm like jesus fuck why am i so shit at games and like i've played so many games for a while and i'll actively try to be better at them but i just fucking suck man like like like i played hundreds of hours of valorant in csgo and i still was a fucking silver okay but then like again i but then i was like nasty a destiny in cod so i don't understand i think valorant that's the issue listen i needed a fix i needed something else that wasn't csgo and i liked the concept of heroes with like abilities on top of the csgo mechanics or just counter strike mechanics in general um i probably won't i was not a valet girl um i probably won't play fps is on stream because everybody fucking loses their marbles when streamers do i keep just smack the mic again i'm sorry um like how you guys bullied azura into not boy tips three dollars and thirty three cents she be i saw you play another craps treasure and decided i was gonna try it i just finished the game while watching your stream and i hope you finish it because there's plenty of fun dialogue to dub might be difficult though sorry you beat it in six

towel this morning when i went to shower because i had taken my old towel off and i'm like okay i need to do a load of towels and then i forgot to put a fresh towel back on and so i had to walk out on nakey i like kind of like shake myself off like a dog squeeze out my hair throw it up in a little my little uh little dry hair turban that you do you know i have like a little satin um in microfiber towel tie up in my little little head wrap um um and then i had a waddle my little cold wet ass to the my closet to grab a towel and fia and boomie are in between my legs and i'm like i'm gonna die i'm wet i'm cold i'm afraid i'm gonna trip over a child and i was able to tell myself uh this is how my dog feels after a bad session i remember i had to like bathe fia in the sink she's really tiny so i can just put her in the sink boomie you'd have to put in the tub um but we put her in the sink and i always recommend if you're gonna bathe a cat or even a dog make sure um you put like a towel actually under them and then when you fill it up with water because they can't they freak out when they don't have grip because when they have grip they'll actually just kind of stand there uh so if you lay something down they'll feel a lot better um so i put uh the towel in the sink filled up with you know lukewarm water and she just looked like such a little wet rat i wonder if i can find a i can't did i take a picture of her i don't think i was able to because i was just in my hands are full and then um i have a towel warmer that um i got for christmas and and it's like i was i threw a towel in it and i took her out she was all bundled up in a little perrito and a towel and she was just like screaming and stuff but it was cute and i dried her off um this is when she um her legs didn't work so i had to bathe her because she couldn't like move maneuver her body to bathe herself and sometimes she would have to go accidents but i'm a good mama i clean up after her can we get a wet cat pick next time excuse me perrito are you next to what i don't know that view yeah it's actually good advice yeah cats actually they start when they start to scrabble everywhere and they can't
