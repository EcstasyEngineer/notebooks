WEBVTT

01:30.000 --> 01:50.800
Oh my God! Hi, Haram! How's it going? Ignore my floating head. Don't worry about that,

01:50.800 --> 01:57.600
sweetheart, okay? Are my goffs here? My goffs better be here. Thanks for watching. It's

01:57.600 --> 02:06.080
your girl, Shibony, Darkness, Dementia, Raven, Cotton, Bumway. Today we're going to be starting

02:06.080 --> 02:17.840
chapter 16 of My Immortal. I have it all nice and cute up for you. Yes, I'm a Dull Han. If you

02:17.840 --> 02:30.080
don't know, I'm a distant friend of Shibi, but my name is Shibony. I am not a rabbit. I'm a Dull Han,

02:30.720 --> 02:39.680
and I am your favorite goth punk princess who loves MCR. And I have a gun, but don't worry about

02:39.680 --> 02:55.040
that. That'll come up later. But how are you guys doing? I'm emo. Yeah, I hate my life. I hate it so

02:55.040 --> 03:03.920
much. The only thing that keeps me going is my dedicated fans, my harlots, my Haram,

03:04.560 --> 03:17.920
a punk haircut. You'll what, my what? You also love, I said MCR, not NCR. This is not fallout.

03:21.360 --> 03:27.680
Hey, that's us. That's you put in pop. Wait, what? I probably shouldn't have used that word.

03:27.680 --> 03:35.200
Yikes. Voldemort gave me a gun. He did. Voldemort did give me a gun.

03:38.960 --> 03:43.440
Oh, yeah, go back to work. Yeah, if you got to work, totally understand. If you need to sleep,

03:43.440 --> 03:51.520
go to sleep. If you need to read your Bible passages, read your Bible passages. So, yes,

03:52.480 --> 03:59.600
you can have me in the background. You can just totally zone me out. I love my lurkers.

04:00.560 --> 04:03.680
I love my chatters. We all we all here.

04:05.840 --> 04:11.840
Put in pop is like an off brand Harley Quinn. Yeah, let's let's pretend that's what that meant.

04:12.640 --> 04:21.440
I'm already starting off strong, she be already I mean, shibony.

04:24.800 --> 04:30.720
Okay, okay, okay. Wait, why am I my face in the wrong direction? There we go.

04:34.720 --> 04:37.920
Yeah, we are about to read the Bible. How's that monetization going?

04:38.720 --> 04:45.920
Um, I'm monetized. Or do you mean like my personal channel like shibonies chant shibonies channel

04:45.920 --> 04:53.200
I can even pronounce my own name. I like taking over she bees channel so like totally don't worry

04:53.200 --> 05:00.320
about that. But yeah, you can always catch up and watch part two and the VOD it was lots of fun.

05:01.280 --> 05:08.960
So so far, if you don't know if you're first, if you're just tuning in now to the amazingness

05:08.960 --> 05:15.600
that is my immortal. So my immortal is a fan fiction commonly believed to be satire, but I'm

05:15.600 --> 05:23.280
the author just so you know, I'm claiming that title. It is a fan fiction of Harry Potter with a

05:23.280 --> 05:33.200
self insert. My personal OC, ebony dementia darkness way. Yes, dementia. That's what I said.

05:35.440 --> 05:43.520
This is my favorite piece of any sort of fiction. I mean, nonfiction ever written,

05:43.520 --> 05:45.840
by the way, and I wrote it. So of course, you know, it's good.

05:46.480 --> 05:54.720
Um, and it's about ebony, and she goes to Hogwarts, and she's in love with Draco. By the way,

05:54.720 --> 06:00.800
everybody's goth. So preps get out like if you're a prep, if you're wearing Amber Convery and Fitch

06:00.800 --> 06:09.200
right now, get the fuck out. We don't like you here. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Well, except if you

06:09.200 --> 06:13.600
see on excites high school second place, I've never read Sonic High School, maybe I'll read that one

06:13.600 --> 06:25.040
next. And then I'll dress up as a Sonic character. Oh, God. Oh, no. Um, no preps, no preps allowed.

06:25.040 --> 06:34.480
Preps. Preps can go kiss your sister, you know, in Minecraft.

06:37.120 --> 06:40.960
And my late how do you mean don't worry, we just started sugar tits. We're good. Don't

06:40.960 --> 06:45.200
worry about it. You guys like my little meme. I mean, did you look guys like the meme that she

06:45.200 --> 06:51.680
be made on her Twitter? From what I heard, it took her like an hour to put that together.

06:54.400 --> 06:56.160
But she's very proud of herself.

06:56.720 --> 07:04.560
Emo's only goffs only. So everybody take out your razor.

07:15.520 --> 07:22.000
Everybody take out your blood and your your chokers, specifically my hands, my hands will

07:22.000 --> 07:30.320
make a great necklace for you, by the way. And we'll we'll get into it. So where we left off

07:31.200 --> 07:42.560
is that so Ebony just found out that possibly Draco and vampire aka Harry Potter are together

07:42.560 --> 07:48.480
or were together and they're about to go to a concert. Can I make make this bigger?

07:48.480 --> 07:54.880
My wings are in the way, but you guys don't need to read. There's some people that I don't

07:54.880 --> 07:59.600
want to accidentally like show their face out of respect. So I'm covering them with my emote.

08:02.160 --> 08:09.440
I mean, she visa emote. Let me let me switch the music. Let's see if this gets copyrighted.

08:10.080 --> 08:13.840
The other time it did, but this said it was copyright free.

08:13.840 --> 08:23.120
Is that too loud? Is it is it too loud?

08:27.520 --> 08:33.440
Guys, tell me when do you get your own emotes? I don't know. I don't know if I'll ever get my

08:33.440 --> 08:42.720
emotes. It's good. Okay. I'm gonna a little quieter. Do you like this spooky ambiance? Is that good?

08:44.160 --> 08:52.560
I think that's fine. Also, I wanted to say thank you for you guys for your support lately.

08:55.120 --> 09:01.120
Why is why did you just move up? Why the fuck? Why are you guys talking so much? Oh wait,

09:01.120 --> 09:06.880
it's because I made this bigger. I'm actually stupid. Don't worry about it. It's small again.

09:06.880 --> 09:14.480
Anyways, they actually have their own faces of profile. No, it's not that. It's just like it's

09:14.480 --> 09:19.920
who the because this is like archived. It's not like on fanfiction.net, but it's easier for me to

09:19.920 --> 09:25.120
read. There's also like cliff notes or like footnotes of like what she's trying to say.

09:26.480 --> 09:34.320
I mean, what I'm trying to say. Because I tend to misspell things a lot. So it is what it is,

09:34.320 --> 09:40.080
you know. Do we have anything gothic? What do you mean? We're reading stuff gothic right now.

09:42.160 --> 09:46.560
But yeah, we're about to go to an MCR concert. Oh no, just kidding. We're about to go to a good

09:46.560 --> 09:53.040
Charlotte concert. Wait, just kidding. I think good Charlotte and MCR there. So I think we're

09:53.680 --> 10:00.400
we're just having a great time. I can't remember any of the voices that I did except that Ebony

10:00.400 --> 10:10.560
is a Valley girl. So I will do that. Let me just but what I was just gonna say, thank you for people

10:10.560 --> 10:18.720
supporting me. Somebody bought me I am the internal ear monitor thingies off throne and I thank you so

10:18.720 --> 10:24.000
much because I can't I'm realizing that you really can't wear over the ear headphones. They're just

10:24.000 --> 10:29.200
not it's hurting my ears, especially when I wear my glasses. Because yes, I'm wearing glasses right

10:29.200 --> 10:36.560
now. How does that make you feel? It's because I'm fucking blind. I just I don't know what to tell you.

10:37.680 --> 10:40.720
Vampires goofy. Okay, Draco was mommy. Vampires goofy.

10:43.440 --> 10:49.200
Copyright free gothic ambient ambient music. It's called trick or treat Halloween slash

10:49.200 --> 10:56.640
autumn lo-fi no copyright playlist. I like when I nod my head.

11:00.160 --> 11:04.640
Also this like hoodie doesn't have a back in it. It's usually just like see through. So I stuck

11:04.640 --> 11:10.640
like ornaments behind me from YouTube studio. So it looks like it's the behind the hood.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.680
Wait, can I put on glasses? If I put on glasses, I don't think

11:20.000 --> 11:24.480
they won't pin because my head is technically an asset right now.

11:29.200 --> 11:39.920
It'll just be like, oh my god, why do I look so fucking cute? Hello?

11:41.680 --> 11:48.240
Hi, hi, it's me, Shibani, Darkness, dementia, cotton bomb way.

11:49.600 --> 11:54.080
How does this make you feel? Do you think I look cute? Do you think I hold on to make them bigger?

11:54.160 --> 12:00.240
Do you think am I your am I the emo girl of your dreams? I better be the emo girl of your dreams

12:00.240 --> 12:06.160
if I'm not. Your wrists are going to be covered in ketchup. That's all I'm going to say.

12:09.040 --> 12:17.200
Nerd goth. Shibi nerd goth. I mean, yeah, imagine Shibi copied my style. That'd be crazy.

12:17.440 --> 12:22.160
Bigger? Okay. All right, I think we're good.

12:26.000 --> 12:33.520
I can't pin up so I moved six of the models, sadly. So it is what it is. Shibi would never.

12:34.640 --> 12:40.000
I look so comically. Isn't there like a cartoon character that has like comically big glasses

12:40.000 --> 12:47.360
like this? Who the fuck is Takane Louis? I think I'm cultured. I'm not.

12:49.520 --> 12:53.360
When did Shibi go goth? I'm not Shibi. I'm Shibani.

12:55.280 --> 12:59.760
How many times do I have to say my damn name? I'm Shibani, Darkness, Dementia, Raven, Cotton,

12:59.760 --> 13:04.560
Bumway. God damn it. I mean, Satan damn it.

13:09.200 --> 13:14.720
All right. But I hope you guys are ready. I'm gonna, this is actually, I think I might keep the

13:14.720 --> 13:19.920
glasses on. Glasses are no glasses. You want glasses or no glasses? What do you think?

13:20.720 --> 13:25.440
They won't be able to move properly. They'll just kind of be hanging out, but it is what

13:26.320 --> 13:34.000
it is. Glasses? Okay. Okay. I'll keep the glasses on. We're very studious, you know, very studious.

13:35.120 --> 13:40.560
Let me just adjust those glasses. Hello. These actually look like the glasses that I'm wearing,

13:40.560 --> 13:44.880
except my frames are bigger and they're black, but I think I might get red glasses just to

13:44.880 --> 13:51.440
not be cute. I'm never, it's not a phase, mom. It's a lifestyle. Okay. Get it, get it, get it

13:51.440 --> 14:00.880
together. All right. Where is, what did I do with the window? Okay, there it is. Are you ready,

14:00.880 --> 14:07.520
everybody? So I got some chips, chips and gold fishies, and they got some apple juice.

14:07.840 --> 14:15.600
Um, um, um, um, um, um. That person over there has a border.

14:18.880 --> 14:19.360
Make sure,

14:25.040 --> 14:31.600
make sure you guys are comfy, cozy.

14:38.080 --> 14:39.360
I have the tweet that I'm live.

14:43.520 --> 14:46.560
This is nice. This is nice. Thank you for the reminder.

14:55.680 --> 15:01.120
Oh my God, I'm almost close to 10K on my main. That's just so weird to me. Why are people like me? I

15:01.120 --> 15:14.240
don't, you like this? You like what you see right now? Why? Why are you? Stop. I expected it to be like,

15:15.520 --> 15:20.080
there's too many people. I'm getting overwhelmed. Okay, hold on.

15:23.360 --> 15:26.800
I think, yeah, let's have the Dono Alerts turned on so you guys can

15:27.760 --> 15:31.200
don't know and text to speech to your, to your heart's content.

15:32.560 --> 15:35.920
What the fuck am I doing? Oh yeah, I'm live. I'm tweeting that I'm live.

15:36.880 --> 15:57.440
I am streaming this right now. If you want to come watch silly voices, I need a burp. Um,

15:58.400 --> 16:09.600
then my nose is itchy. Then get here right now, please.

16:12.320 --> 16:21.520
Where is, I can't, where am I? Where am I? Where am I? Oh my God. Why does it never remember what

16:21.520 --> 16:28.240
emojis I use when I'm on my PC? Because I hate having to scroll all the way to look for that one

16:28.240 --> 16:51.440
red button looking emoji. Okay, we're good. And then I just need to retweet

16:51.520 --> 16:59.040
that on my sexy account because everybody pays attention to that one more. But that's fine. It's

16:59.040 --> 17:17.360
okay. All right. Real fans have noticed for JB's tweets. Make sure to spam that like button,

17:17.360 --> 17:23.920
hit subscribe, ding that bell, ding my bell, all ring yours. Let's start. Okay.

17:24.720 --> 17:30.000
Chapter 16. I'm not going to read the author's notes because they're kind of redundant.

17:32.800 --> 17:39.360
We ran happily to Hogsmeade. There we saw the stage where GC had played. We ran in happily.

17:40.000 --> 17:46.480
MCR playing Helena. I was so fucking happy. Gerard looked even sexier than he did in the pictures.

17:47.120 --> 17:51.920
Even Draco thought so. I could totally see him getting an erection, but it didn't matter because

17:51.920 --> 17:57.680
I knew we were only the true ones for each other. I was wearing a black leather mini dress and black

17:57.680 --> 18:04.240
leather platinum boots with red ripped fishnets. Draco was wearing a black baggy MCR t-shirt and

18:04.240 --> 18:10.000
black baggy pants. Anyway, we started mashing to Helena. We fringed. We ran up to the front of the

18:10.000 --> 18:16.800
band to stage dive. Suddenly Gerard pulled off his mask. So did the others. We gasped. It wasn't

18:16.800 --> 18:29.280
them at all. It was comma ellipses. Those some more into death dealers. What the fuck, Draco? I'm

18:29.280 --> 18:36.080
not going to a concert with yo. I shouted angrily. Not after what happened to me last time. Wait,

18:36.080 --> 18:40.960
we're already at the concert. Even if it's MCR and you know how much I licked them.

18:42.480 --> 18:49.440
What? Cause we, you know, he got get it uncomfortably because guys don't like to talk about you know

18:49.440 --> 18:57.440
what? Yeah, cause we, you know, I yielded in an angry voice. We won't do that again. Draco promised.

18:58.000 --> 19:02.880
This time we're going with an escort. It's a Zara.

19:09.360 --> 19:13.840
Hello, hello, everybody just coming in. We just started. So we haven't missed much.

19:16.080 --> 19:23.840
Oh, MFG WTF. Are you giving in to the mainstream? I asked. So I guess you're a prep or a Christina

19:23.920 --> 19:30.560
or what now? No, he muttered loudly. Are you becoming a prepper? What? I shooted

19:31.440 --> 19:33.840
angrily. Don't worry. I'll put my gun at some point.

19:35.520 --> 19:40.640
And no, I'm not. Please come with me. He fell down to his knees and started singing

19:40.640 --> 19:47.280
the world is black by GC to me. I was flattened because that's not even a single. He had memorized

19:47.280 --> 20:00.000
the lyrics just for me. Scroll down. Okay, then I guess I will have to. I said, and then we Frenched

20:00.000 --> 20:04.720
for a while and then I went up to my room. I'm confused. I thought we were at the concert,

20:04.720 --> 20:09.280
but I guess not. Maybe it was a dream. Bloody Mary was standing there.

20:11.280 --> 20:15.760
Oh wait, this is Japanese. Not a Christina. I think they're like, she's talking about Christina

20:15.760 --> 20:21.840
Aguilera. Well, let me, let me put up my feets. Put up one. Yeah, now I'm confused.

20:23.600 --> 20:26.160
Okay, I'll guess I'll give her a kawaii weeaboo voice.

20:27.920 --> 20:38.240
Hajime Masi did that. I can't read Japanese for shit. Hajime Masi did. Girl. She said happily.

20:38.240 --> 20:43.680
She speaks Japanese. So do I. That means how do you do in Japanese? Wait, Hajime,

20:44.240 --> 20:47.920
Hajime Masi. I don't, I don't feel like she's spelled that right.

20:53.360 --> 20:59.680
By the way, Willow the fucking poser got expelled. Yo, what happened to Willow? Willow was my IRL

20:59.680 --> 21:07.680
friends. I mean, yes, I said me. She filed all her classes looks like author had a falling out

21:07.680 --> 21:12.880
of their best friend that she also inserted. And she's skipped math. Offers note. Raven,

21:12.880 --> 21:22.160
you fucking suck. Fuck you. It serves that fucking batch of riot. I laughed angrily.

21:23.120 --> 21:29.760
Well, anyway, we were feeling all depressed. We watched some gothic movies like Das Nightmare

21:29.840 --> 21:35.600
before Chris X mess. Maybe Willow will die too. Jesus Christ.

21:40.720 --> 21:44.880
That's not what that means. Yeah, I'm like, I don't think that's what that means either.

21:44.880 --> 22:12.960
Oh, yeah. I have a confession after she got expelled. I murdered her and then Lupin did

22:13.040 --> 22:15.920
it with her because he's on the field with a neck fillack.

22:19.680 --> 22:26.320
Kawaii. I comment happily. We talked to each other in silence.

22:28.400 --> 22:31.440
For the rest of the movie. How do you talk in silence?

22:32.400 --> 22:46.480
Okay. Oh, hey, BTW BT dubs actually is what I'm gonna say BT dubs. I'm going to a concert

22:46.480 --> 22:53.920
with Draco tonight in Hogsmeade with MCR. I said I need to wear like the hottest hot set outfit ever.

22:54.720 --> 23:00.560
Bloody Mary knotted energetically. Oh my fucking God, totally. Let's go shopping.

23:01.440 --> 23:07.280
And hot topic, right? I asked already getting out my special hot topic loyalty card.

23:09.200 --> 23:18.000
No, my head snaped up. What? My head spun spoon. I cannot believe it. Bloody Mary, are you a prep?

23:22.160 --> 23:27.360
She laughed. I found some really cool gothic stores near Hogwarts. That's all.

23:27.680 --> 23:34.560
Oh, who told you about them? I asked. Sure. It would be would be Draco and Diabolo or

23:34.560 --> 23:45.280
Vampire. Don't even say that nom to me. Nom. PTSD or or me. Dumbly door, she said.

23:45.920 --> 23:50.000
Let me sorry. Dumbly door. She said, let me just call our Brahms.

23:50.880 --> 23:58.320
Oh, M F F G. Dumbly door. Wait. Sorry. Oh, M F F G. Dumbly door. I asked quietly.

23:59.280 --> 24:04.560
Yeah, I saw the map for Hogsmeade on his desk. She sold she told me. Come on, let's go.

24:05.760 --> 24:10.240
We are going to a few punk golf stores, especially for the concerts in Hogsmeade.

24:10.240 --> 24:15.360
The salesperson was OMG hotter than Geron, except not because that's impossible. And he gave me a few

24:15.360 --> 24:24.080
dresses. Wait, what voice should I think this is supposed to be Tom Riddle? Um, what voice?

24:25.600 --> 24:27.120
What voice should Tom Riddle?

24:30.000 --> 24:35.600
Prep is starting to sound like a slur. Bloody Mary.

24:39.440 --> 24:44.160
Yeah, they know ASL. We're just speaking in sign language when they're talking quietly.

24:44.720 --> 24:46.160
When they're talking in silence.

24:50.000 --> 24:59.120
I think because isn't Tom Riddle played by like, who is it? Robert Pattinson. So I do like a British

24:59.120 --> 25:12.960
accent. I'll do that. Let me finish chewing my chippies. No, it's not going to be Road Man.

25:14.720 --> 25:18.160
No, not Reddler.

25:21.360 --> 25:24.960
Edward voice. I'm going to do my best. Edward, call an expert and press him.

25:29.120 --> 25:32.080
Hello. Hello. Welcome in. Okay.

25:35.440 --> 25:37.360
We only have these for the real golfs.

25:38.320 --> 25:43.200
Double golfs. Me and Bloody Mary ass.

25:44.080 --> 25:47.520
Yeah, you wouldn't believe how many poses there on this town, man.

25:47.520 --> 25:52.640
Yesterday, Lupin and Snap tried to buy a golfer camera pouch. He shook his head.

25:52.640 --> 25:54.480
I didn't even know they had a camera.

25:56.240 --> 25:59.200
Okay, he sounds Road Man anyways. We'll just keep it like that.

26:00.160 --> 26:07.280
Oh, MFG. No, they're gonna spy on me again. I cried running out of the changing room wearing

26:07.280 --> 26:11.280
a long black dress with lots of red tool coming on very low cut huge slit.

26:13.360 --> 26:18.000
Oh, my Satan, you have to buy that outfit. The salesperson said.

26:18.640 --> 26:21.120
Yeah, it looks totally hot. Said Bloody Mary.

26:22.960 --> 26:26.480
You know what? I'm going to give it to you for free because you look really hot in that

26:26.480 --> 26:30.240
outfit. Hey, are you going to be at the concert tonight? He asked.

26:31.280 --> 26:36.080
Yeah, I'm actually, you guys can't see, but I'm tucking my, my hair behind my ear, like,

26:36.800 --> 26:42.640
like, you know, you know what I'm doing. Yeah, I am actually, I looked back at him.

26:43.680 --> 26:49.200
Hey, BT dubs, my name's Ebandi, the darkness dementia tarot way.

26:50.240 --> 26:53.840
I don't know why I added a name in there, but you know, you get it.

26:54.560 --> 27:01.200
What's yours? Tom Rid, he said, and run a hand through his, his black dyed hair.

27:01.760 --> 27:02.960
Maybe I'll see you there tonight.

27:06.880 --> 27:09.520
The gopher is, I got dark gopher is.

27:12.080 --> 27:17.040
Yeah, I don't think so because I'm going there with my BF, Draco, you sick perv.

27:17.040 --> 27:20.400
I yelled angrily, but before he could beg me to go with him,

27:20.480 --> 27:25.360
Hagrid flew in in this black broom looking worried. Wait, what was Hagrid's voice?

27:25.360 --> 27:30.320
I think Hagrid had a fucking high pitch voice too. Oh fuck.

27:38.960 --> 27:42.560
Was he a cowboy? No, that was Dumbledore. Dumbledore was the cowboy.

27:43.200 --> 27:49.920
Oh my God, Abundi, I need to get back to the castle now.

27:53.440 --> 27:54.640
Oh my God, Abundi.

28:02.080 --> 28:08.960
Okay, okay, okay. Oh, sorry. Let me just cover your face. Fuck, sorry, Janice.

28:13.120 --> 28:15.040
Yeah, I'm not doing Hagrid's voice.

28:18.320 --> 28:23.760
Who is Scottish? I don't remember. I don't remember. Someone was Scottish and I don't remember who it was.

28:25.760 --> 28:31.440
I live in Spain without the S. J.K. Rowling has written it enough already. It's up here for this one.

28:34.400 --> 28:40.560
Okay, Tom, wait, hold on. Let me like move my glasses over because there's like a little bit.

28:41.520 --> 28:48.560
I'm reading. There we go. And then I won't move my head as I read this next passage.

28:53.840 --> 28:58.640
Tom Riddle gave us some clothes and stuff for free. He said he would help us with makeup

28:58.640 --> 29:05.360
if he wanted because he was really into fashion and stuff. He's bisexual. Hagrid kept shooting at

29:05.360 --> 29:12.880
us to come back to Hogwarts. WTF, Hagrid. I said angrily. Fuck off you fujacking bastard.

29:13.680 --> 29:17.440
Well, anyway, Willow came. Hagrid went away angrily.

29:19.200 --> 29:25.360
Hey bitch, you look kawaii. She said, yeah, but not as kawaii as yo. I answered sadly because Willow's

29:25.360 --> 29:34.880
really pretty in everything. Oh wait, did they make up? Okay. Hell yeah. She's, they made up. It's good.

29:36.320 --> 29:40.160
Oh my, oh my God, he was bisexual.

29:43.440 --> 29:45.200
My scheduled guys are so hot.

29:48.480 --> 29:53.120
She was wearing a short black corset thingy with bloodlet lace on it and a black or blood red

29:53.120 --> 29:58.720
miniskirt, leather fishnets and black pointy pointy boots that showed up how pale she was.

29:59.680 --> 30:04.400
She had a really nice body with big bobs and everything. She was thin enough to be in a

30:04.400 --> 30:09.360
rexic. So what's she like?

30:12.640 --> 30:19.600
So are you going to the concert with Draco? She asked. Yeah, I said happily. I'm going with

30:19.600 --> 30:27.920
Diabolo. She answered happily. Well, anyway, Draco and Diabolo came. Diabolo, Diabolo, Diabolo.

30:28.720 --> 30:30.560
I don't know. Let's do some bloat.

30:32.960 --> 30:38.640
They were both looking extremely hot and sexy and you could tell they thought we were ought to.

30:40.240 --> 30:41.680
What's ought to?

30:44.240 --> 30:53.920
Big Bob's intersex. She got the nomi from one piece, Bonnie. Oh no, not the nomi. She got nomi.

30:54.480 --> 31:04.080
Diabolo was wearing a black t-shirt that said 666 on it. He is wearing tons off makeup just

31:04.080 --> 31:09.360
like Marilyn Manson. Draco was wearing black leather pants, a gothic black GC t-shirt and

31:09.360 --> 31:17.040
black vans he got from the Warped Tower. Bloody Mart was going to the concert with Dracola.

31:17.040 --> 31:23.920
Dracola used to be called Navel, but it turned out that he was getting after birth in his real

31:23.920 --> 31:32.640
family who were vampires. They died. Died as in D-Y-E-D, by the way, not...

31:35.120 --> 31:38.000
Shut up. Shut up, guys. Don't read my burp. Don't read my burp.

31:40.320 --> 31:45.840
Navel converted to Satanism and he went goth. He was in Slytherin now.

31:46.800 --> 31:52.560
He was wearing a black warped t-shirt, black jeans, and shoes with black hair with red streaks

31:52.560 --> 31:58.240
in it. We call him Dracula now. Well, anyways, we all went to Draco's Black Mercy Benz,

31:58.240 --> 32:04.800
get it? Cause we're go- gopific. That his dad, Lucian, gave him. We did pot, coke, and crack.

32:05.520 --> 32:13.680
Draco and I made out. We made fun of those stupid fucking preps. We soon got there. I gasped.

32:16.800 --> 32:25.280
Not the Navel. Average day. Yeah, it's just, you know, day in my life, ma'am. Day in my life.

32:25.280 --> 32:35.040
I need some good chips.

32:40.720 --> 32:42.400
Let me some cattle-cooked chips.

32:48.480 --> 32:50.320
Yeah, they did hot pot, Coca-Cola, and crack.

32:56.240 --> 33:00.400
A little bit of crunching ASMR for you.

33:07.680 --> 33:08.720
Crazy meal set.

33:13.600 --> 33:15.440
Minds me, I forgot to eat today again.

33:18.000 --> 33:21.840
I'm just living off of chips and goldfish for a day. Okay.

33:22.640 --> 33:23.040
Okay.

33:25.040 --> 33:30.720
Gerard was the sexiest guy ever. He looked even sexier than he did in pics.

33:30.720 --> 33:36.240
He had long, red and black hair, embarrassing blue eyes. He was really skinny and he had an

33:36.240 --> 33:47.200
amazing ethnic voice. Uh, what is ethnic? What's an ethnic voice?

33:47.920 --> 33:54.640
We marched to Helena and some other songs. Suddenly Gerard pulled off his mask and so did

33:54.640 --> 34:01.600
it. Wait a second. Did she, oh, she must have like written the first part before in the last

34:01.600 --> 34:11.680
chapter, but then decided she wanted to add more exposition. I gasped. It wasn't Gerard at all.

34:11.680 --> 34:16.240
It was an ugly, preppy man with no nose and red eyes. It was,

34:22.000 --> 34:28.080
I was, I was, I almost threw shade. I was not even like through shade, like in a mean way,

34:28.080 --> 34:32.240
but I'm like, it'd be funny if I like rewrote this thing with actual VTubers names.

34:33.040 --> 34:45.520
Oh, okay. Everyone ran away about me and Draco. Draco and I came. It was Voldemort and the death

34:45.520 --> 34:52.000
dealers. I need to breathe.

34:55.360 --> 35:02.640
You moronic idiots. He's shooting angstily. And Obi, I told you to kill vampire,

35:02.640 --> 35:11.040
thou have failed, and now I shall kill thou and Draco. No, please, we beg sadly, but he took out his knife.

35:16.480 --> 35:21.280
Hello, hello. Bealer goes to Hogwarts? Oh no.

35:25.440 --> 35:30.720
My gosh. Strawberry pop tart. Why would you stick, why would you stick a pop tart in the

35:30.720 --> 35:40.320
microwave? You're crazy. I forgot how dumbly word, dumb, I almost said dumbly door. Dumbly worded

35:40.320 --> 35:45.440
this thick was. Should have been spilt knife. I know she spilt knife, right? I'm very impressed.

35:46.480 --> 35:53.760
Suddenly a gothic old man flew as in the sickness on his brimstick. He had lung as in the organ,

35:53.760 --> 36:02.720
black hair and a long black bread. He was wearing a black robe that said Abra Levine on the back.

36:02.720 --> 36:10.720
He shot to the spell and Voldemort ran away. It was dumbly door. I don't know why I'm getting an

36:10.800 --> 36:18.960
accent when I'm doing this. Sorry, Jacob, we're cutting your face off, Jacob. I'm sorry, bro.

36:18.960 --> 36:24.960
There we go. No, your chin is showing. You cannot be seen. Be gone, Jacob.

36:28.080 --> 36:30.960
He burnt his bread, just like Azura.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.840
I woke up, done that, wait.

36:41.280 --> 36:48.880
Did I just fall asleep? I don't. Anyways, I woke up the next day in my coffin. I walked

36:48.880 --> 36:59.200
out of it and put on some black eyeliner, black eyeshadow, black eyeshadow, blood,

36:59.200 --> 37:04.160
blood, bed or lipstick and black really low cut leather dress that was all ripped and in

37:04.160 --> 37:09.760
stripes so you could see my belly. I was wearing a skull belly ring with black and red diamonds

37:09.760 --> 37:14.000
inside of it. That's pretty hot. I'm not going to lie. A reference persona.

37:16.480 --> 37:20.960
The night before, Draco and I rent back to the skull, get it skull because I'm

37:20.960 --> 37:26.800
gothic and I like death. Dumbledore chased Voldemort away. We flew there on our brooms.

37:26.800 --> 37:33.920
Mine was black and the broom stuff was blood red. The broom stuff. There was lace all over it.

37:33.920 --> 37:40.240
Draco had a black MCR boom. We went back to our rooms and we had a, you know what,

37:40.240 --> 37:41.840
to a Lincoln Park song.

37:48.080 --> 37:54.160
Well, anyway, I went down to the Great Hall. There was all the walls, sorry, there all the walls

37:54.160 --> 37:59.520
were painted black and the tables were black too. But you could see that there was pink

37:59.600 --> 38:06.640
pants underneath the black pants and there was pastors of poser bands everywhere like Ashley

38:06.640 --> 38:12.800
Simpson and the Backstreet Boys. They danced. Yeah, they totally, they danced.

38:14.800 --> 38:17.200
My room is plastic and I bought a new Walmart.

38:22.560 --> 38:28.560
WTF, I shouted, going to sit next to Bloody Mary and Willow. Bloody Mary, here we fucking go,

38:28.560 --> 38:33.760
was wearing a black leather mini with a good Charlotte T-shirt, black fishnets and black pointy

38:33.760 --> 38:39.040
boots. Well, I was wearing a long gothic black dress with blood red riding. That was all lacy

38:39.040 --> 38:44.880
and came up to your thighs and black boots and fishnets. Vampire Dracula and Draco came.

38:46.240 --> 38:52.400
Okay, totally unnecessary. We started to talk about who was sexier, Mikey or Gerard Way or

38:52.400 --> 38:59.600
Billy Joe Armstrong. The boys joined in because they were bi. Those guys are so fucking hot.

39:00.160 --> 39:05.120
Navel was saying a suddenly a gothic old man with a black beard and everything came.

39:05.840 --> 39:11.600
He was the same one who had chased Voldemort, away Voldemort yesterday. He had normal tan skin,

39:11.600 --> 39:19.280
but he was wearing white foundation and he had dyed his hair black, dyed as in dead and hair as in

39:19.280 --> 39:30.000
like the rabbit. The old man came. My thighs, this is your thighs, up to your thighs, so I guess

39:30.000 --> 39:41.440
you're wearing the so fit. Zombold door. Wheel gas. WTF, I shouted angrily. I thought he was just

39:41.440 --> 39:49.200
wearing that to scare Voldemort. Hello, everyone. He said happily, as you can see, I gave the

39:49.200 --> 40:00.320
room a makeover. What do you think about it? Everyone from the poser table and Gryffindor

40:00.960 --> 40:06.000
started to cheer. Well, we got to just look at each other all disfusted and shook our heads.

40:06.720 --> 40:15.040
We kind of believe you. What a poser he was. BT dubs. You can call me Albert. He called as we left

40:15.040 --> 40:26.400
to our glasses. Why is it capitalized? What a fucking poser. Draco shouted angrily as we we

40:26.400 --> 40:33.040
to transformation. We were holding hands. Vampire looked really jealous. I could see him crying

40:33.040 --> 40:43.520
blood in a gothic way. Get it? Way like Gerard. Like Gerard. But I didn't say anything. I bet he's

40:43.520 --> 40:51.920
having a midlife crisis. Well, I'm shouted. I was so fucking angry. I have to read the spelling

40:51.920 --> 40:58.160
mistakes are what makes this. I don't I could not I couldn't go without it. You know, hold on,

40:58.160 --> 41:06.800
let me fix my glasses. Perfect. It's because when I lean forward and lean back, it doesn't, doesn't

41:06.800 --> 41:16.640
notice. Chippy break. How's everybody doing so far?

41:21.840 --> 41:25.840
Are you guys surviving? Are you guys thriving?

41:26.160 --> 41:35.680
You have questions? Okay, let's class raise your hand if you have a question.

41:41.920 --> 41:47.280
Go on. Is mischief? No, he's not in the story.

41:48.160 --> 41:57.840
I'm coming more gothic by the second good. Yes, you in the front. What's your question? I see you

41:57.840 --> 42:06.720
raising your hand. You like my take on it. I'm glad.

42:06.720 --> 42:20.800
What's going on? You don't need to know dying by a little of laughing. I just finished my second

42:20.800 --> 42:30.960
tangerine. I'm so happy for you. How much more cringe would my immortal be if it were written

42:30.960 --> 42:38.560
with brain rot? I feel like it wouldn't change. How old is the author of the time of writing this?

42:38.560 --> 42:47.600
I think she was like 16. You're wondering if all of you alert girls are saline or Ravenclaw?

42:48.160 --> 42:48.720
I can tell you.

42:52.160 --> 43:00.000
Here's my Hogwarts house headcanon. I am Gryffindor. Azura is Hufflepuff.

43:01.440 --> 43:10.000
Amy is Slytherin. Icy is Hufflepuff. Strawny is Gryffindor.

43:10.320 --> 43:16.480
And Mercy is Ravenclaw.

43:28.640 --> 43:31.440
I was thinking because I don't think Strawny would be

43:31.520 --> 43:38.240
in Slytherin.

43:49.440 --> 43:55.040
No, but they do know who wrote this. It was Tara Gillesbee. She wrote it for satire.

43:55.360 --> 44:02.640
But just kidding. I actually wrote it. It was my real life account when I went to Hogwarts.

44:12.080 --> 44:18.720
Anyone question? Who is Gerard? From the Witcher? You can picture him like that because that's kind

44:18.720 --> 44:29.440
of hot. Like Henry Cavill Witcher or a video game Witcher. Either one would be golden. But no,

44:29.440 --> 44:47.840
Gerard Way is the lead singer of MCR. My Chemical Romance. Gerald. I have the Witcher 1 and 2.

44:47.840 --> 44:50.320
I thought I had the Wild Hunt. But I guess I don't.

44:59.520 --> 45:03.440
Geralt. He'll be the hot teacher. He have intrusive thoughts about.

45:04.720 --> 45:09.120
He doesn't even have to be a hot teacher. I would just have thoughts about him.

45:10.080 --> 45:16.480
Geralt. Yes, Geralt. Gerald actually.

45:18.960 --> 45:23.520
She be Witcher Marathon when? Like I was gonna like play in the games or like watching it.

45:23.520 --> 45:26.960
Because I'll gladly watch it with you guys again. I like the the TV show.

45:28.560 --> 45:31.840
On Netflix. What day is it today?

45:32.000 --> 45:35.760
Hi, Siri. What day is it?

45:40.960 --> 45:49.440
Oh, goodie. I have my members stream tomorrow. Or we get to watch the Master of Disguise together.

45:54.800 --> 45:58.000
No, I haven't done anything. It'll be my first membership stream.

46:02.800 --> 46:04.640
Yeah, we're gonna join the Turtle Club.

46:10.240 --> 46:15.600
You're going to miss it. How dare you? Do I have to start being more possessive?

46:15.600 --> 46:20.640
Am I being too nice? I'll be like, you guys better give me so much attention or I'm gonna die.

46:20.640 --> 46:25.840
I'm like a plant. I'm gonna wither away and I'm gonna perish. If you don't tell me you love me right now.

46:31.920 --> 46:40.720
Why do you guys have jobs? Jobs are to watch me. Give me attention and love and affection.

46:41.600 --> 46:46.080
Because I'm lonely and I crave all the affection and attention in the world.

46:49.840 --> 46:52.080
I tried to hold that one back and it didn't really work out for me.

46:52.400 --> 47:00.400
You love me? You love me? But your name's in gray. You're a fucking light-nosed.

47:09.280 --> 47:15.920
Most stable VTB. I can go real manhara. I didn't get real yandere. You ain't seen nothing yet.

47:15.920 --> 47:20.080
You ain't seen nothing. You ain't seen nothing. But no, no, I'm gonna be good.

47:20.080 --> 47:26.800
I'm gonna be good because I'm a responsible little streamer and I am...

47:28.880 --> 47:34.000
My marbles are in the jar. None of them. They've all been gathered.

47:35.760 --> 47:42.480
Manhara. That sounds like it should be a segment.

47:42.480 --> 47:53.920
That actually is a segment where I just... I don't even know what it would be about. So give me ideas.

47:59.920 --> 48:01.840
I had to fill the jar with something.

48:04.160 --> 48:11.920
I love my madam because madam loves us wrong. But I need to make money to spend on that.

48:13.200 --> 48:18.400
Am I like a cat? I'm like a... I'm like an independent cat that just like roams your house

48:19.200 --> 48:25.600
and I give you love and affection sometimes but on my terms. And then you just give me lots of treats

48:25.600 --> 48:31.280
and you buy me lots of toys and cat trees and you just hope one day that I'll just be able to

48:31.280 --> 48:35.920
speak and tell you how much I love you back but I never do because I'm a cat.

48:43.040 --> 48:51.760
As someone who has two cats, this is already a reality. Perfectly explained, see?

48:53.920 --> 48:56.080
Makes sense as why I was a cat in my past life.

48:59.760 --> 49:04.480
Agon, she's here. She be scratching the door, you open, then you stare and you walk away.

49:04.480 --> 49:09.040
Yeah, pretty much. I'm gonna sit on your desk while you're playing game and I'm gonna knock

49:10.000 --> 49:16.240
your g-fuel, your gamer sups off your desk because I want your attention and pets.

49:18.640 --> 49:24.160
You did own a cat once. What happened to it? Why? Why are you saying that so ominously?

49:25.440 --> 49:31.840
That's what happens if we touch your belly. You know, I don't like belly rubs. It just...

49:32.560 --> 49:40.240
I'm not feeling... You give me headpats, you can scratch my booty, but belly rubs.

49:40.240 --> 49:44.800
I'm gonna have to use my claws on you, sport. I'm sorry, you know?

49:48.560 --> 49:50.720
Some of those cats can bring a serious income.

49:53.280 --> 49:56.480
I must be the only cat owner who's never had their cat knock shit off their desk,

49:57.440 --> 50:02.160
actually, my cats don't really do that. I'm trying to...

50:03.680 --> 50:06.800
They don't, yeah, they don't really knock things off my desk. So usually just like,

50:06.800 --> 50:10.320
Boomi will just like pick it up in his mouth and just run away with it. He doesn't knock it off.

50:14.560 --> 50:22.400
Stretch. Ignore my delahod head being contained by only...

50:22.400 --> 50:31.760
Uh, what's it called? My hoodie, flying off into the distance.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.480
I don't use a desk. Yeah, they just sit on the floor.

50:41.200 --> 50:44.000
It's in me to face it. No, I'm kidding. I'm teasing you. I'm teasing you.

50:45.600 --> 50:51.120
Oh, she's touching this. Okay, rest in peace. Good cat. I've had several cats.

50:52.400 --> 50:57.200
Growing up. So I totally get it. I don't even know where my cats are right now.

50:57.200 --> 51:00.080
I think Boomi's laying in his bed. I cleaned my house today.

51:02.720 --> 51:06.000
The cats were terrified by the new vacuum. Boomi, I don't even...

51:06.000 --> 51:09.760
Like Reina just sat on the couch and was chilling and she was just watching it because she's

51:09.760 --> 51:15.440
keeping an eye. And then Fia was hiding under the bed. Now that she can do that, there's a little

51:15.440 --> 51:22.000
spot in the cat stairs. It's like a bed. And so she like goes inside the cat stairs and then

51:22.000 --> 51:28.240
just like sleeps in there and hangs out when she's chilling. And then Boomi was just walking around

51:28.240 --> 51:35.280
with his... The hair on his back bristled in fright with this little... The base of his tail poofy.

51:35.920 --> 51:41.280
And then just like... But then like wouldn't walk away from the vacuum. And I'm like, dude,

51:41.280 --> 51:46.640
if you're scared of it, just like, why are you keep like... You're just staring at it. I'm like,

51:46.640 --> 51:50.960
are you like someone who likes to watch like horror movies because you like the adrenaline it gives

51:51.040 --> 51:56.400
you? Like you have every... Like your fight or flight is non-existent. Like the cat. I don't even...

51:57.280 --> 52:03.200
Boomi is just a dork. He climbed into my fridge for the like 50th time today. Boomi likes to chill

52:03.200 --> 52:10.640
out in my fridge. I don't know why he does. It's not like he's hot. He just likes to go in there.

52:11.520 --> 52:19.360
I took a picture of him in my empty fridge because I went to go get some juice and I left it open

52:19.360 --> 52:27.440
for a second. And then he... It's a cool vibe. He just wanted to vibe in the fridge. And he...

52:29.360 --> 52:33.280
I can't really explain it. But you know how there's like a little like side... Like when you open the

52:33.280 --> 52:38.240
doors, there's usually like in the doors, you can like put like condiments and stuff. And usually

52:38.240 --> 52:45.680
like in the bottom, there's like a place where you can stick like a juice or like a water thing.

52:46.240 --> 52:55.600
So I like... Mind you, I couldn't... So I was like half closed. So like one door was open, one was

52:55.600 --> 53:00.480
closed. And I go to close the other one and I see Boomi's head sticking out. And I'm like,

53:00.480 --> 53:04.960
dude, what are you doing? So I open the door so I can get him out. And he's just sitting in the bottom

53:06.000 --> 53:13.120
thing. And then so he just like slowly comes out of the fridge, but like sitting in the shelf

53:13.120 --> 53:20.560
from the fridge. And I was just losing it because it was just so funny how he just slowly was like,

53:22.080 --> 53:27.600
I'm in the bottom. I will post a picture. I took a picture of it, but you guys can't bully me.

53:28.640 --> 53:31.120
He wants some sauce from the fridge. Hey, shut up.

53:34.560 --> 53:38.080
I don't know why he gets in there because then I have to wipe it every time he gets in there

53:38.080 --> 53:42.160
because it was... I don't want his dirty paws in my fridge, you know, my refrigerator.

53:42.800 --> 53:46.080
I'm the sauce lady. I come out and I throw sauce everywhere.

53:48.640 --> 53:55.920
All right, let's continue. Hope everybody enjoyed that break. Let me move my glasses back.

53:55.920 --> 54:05.760
Make a comfort. All right.

54:26.640 --> 54:32.880
I'm sorry. That was one of my favorite memes when Batman came out.

54:35.440 --> 54:41.840
Anyways, why can't I get my glasses to work? Come on glasses.

54:46.160 --> 54:49.280
Come on. Oh, fine. I'll put them like awkwardly like that.

54:49.280 --> 55:00.080
Why are they big? Let me make them smaller. Let me make them a little smaller.

55:03.520 --> 55:12.400
I can't find... I can't find the window to the walls. My favorite version of that song.

55:13.360 --> 55:14.000
Okay.

55:17.600 --> 55:27.120
Next chapter. Chapter 19. The last thing you want in your Burger King break. Sorry. Anyways.

55:31.920 --> 55:37.520
I'm not okay. I promise. I'm not okay. I promise.

55:37.680 --> 55:48.480
All day, we sat angrily thinking about Dumbledore. We were so fucking pissed off.

55:49.120 --> 55:55.680
Well, I had one thing to look forward to. The MCR concert. It had been post-phoned,

55:55.680 --> 56:03.280
so we could all go. MCR postponed their concert so that everybody from Hogwarts could go. That's

56:03.280 --> 56:12.080
pretty sick. Jill's ASMR roleplay. Just joined. Can we get a recap of what we've read so far?

56:12.640 --> 56:17.200
I've only read like three chapters because I get distracted easily and I like the app.

56:17.760 --> 56:27.040
But so far, Ebony and Draco went to a MCR concert, but it wasn't really MCR. It was

56:28.000 --> 56:35.120
Vulsamort and the Deaf Dealers. And then Dumbledore scared him away. And then Dumbledore is trying

56:35.120 --> 56:40.960
to pretend that he's goth. And so he changed Hogwarts into a goth academy because he's a poser.

56:43.040 --> 56:45.520
MCR is so pissed. Okay.

56:50.480 --> 56:51.040
Where the fuck?

56:52.720 --> 56:53.520
I lost my spot.

56:58.000 --> 57:06.000
We were so fucking pissed off. We already said that. Anyway, I went to the common room sadly

57:06.000 --> 57:13.280
to cut classes. Draco was being a little secretive. I asked what it was and he got all mad at me and

57:13.280 --> 57:23.520
started crying all hot and angsty. Aren't sensitive by guys so hot. No one fucking understands me.

57:23.520 --> 57:29.840
Oh wait, sorry. No one fucking understands me. He shouted angrily as his black hair went in

57:29.840 --> 57:36.960
his big blue eyes like Billy Joel, Billy Joe, and Boulevard of Borkin Dreams.

57:41.920 --> 57:48.640
I was wearing a black leather low cut top and chains all over it, all over it. A black leather

57:48.640 --> 57:55.840
mini black high held boots and a cross belly thing. My hair was all up in a messy, really high

57:55.840 --> 58:00.880
bun like Amy Lee and gong under. Email me if you want to see the pic.

58:01.440 --> 58:12.560
I'm gong under, gong under Billy Joe. My dreams are Borkin.

58:14.480 --> 58:17.840
Accused me. What about me? I growled.

58:18.800 --> 58:22.960
Oh no, my head.

58:25.200 --> 58:35.600
Bye, butt, butt. He grunted. You fucking bastard. I moaned. No, wait, it's not what I'm fucking,

58:35.600 --> 58:45.280
wait, no, wait, wait. No, wait, it's not what it fucking looks like. He shouted. Why?

58:48.080 --> 58:51.360
He only said no one understands me. Why am I getting so upset?

58:52.800 --> 58:57.680
But it's too late. I knew what I heard. I ran to the bathroom angrily, cring,

58:58.320 --> 59:06.080
Draco banged on the door. I whipped and I whipped as my bloody eyeliner streamed down my cheeks

59:06.080 --> 59:12.000
and made cool tears down my feces like Benji in the video for girls and boys.

59:12.000 --> 59:17.760
Raven, that is so our video. I took out a cigarette and started to smoke pot.

59:26.480 --> 59:30.960
I took out a cigarette and started to smoke pot.

59:36.640 --> 59:39.600
I'm joking. Oh, okay.

59:42.960 --> 59:47.840
Suddenly Hagrid came. Sorry, Hagrid came. He had a pirated.

59:49.280 --> 59:57.760
You gave me a fucking shock. I shouted angrily, dropping my pot. What WTF you think you're doing

59:57.760 --> 01:00:03.840
in the girls room? Only it wasn't just Hagrid. Someone else was with him too. For a second,

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:07.440
I wanted to be Tom Rid or Draco, but it was Dumbledore.

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:14.000
Hey, I need to ask you a question. He said pulling out his black wannabe

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.800
gothic purse. What are you wearing to the concert?

01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:20.480
You know who MCR are?

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:31.600
I gasped. No, I just I can't maintain the accents. No, I just saw there was a concert

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:37.600
that a lot of goss and punks were going to. Yee-haw. He said, anyway, Draco has a surprise for you.

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:40.480
Is it his pee pee? I don't know.

01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:56.640
You're at a cool concert. Your teacher shows up. Yee-haw. Everyone says to me Yee-haw, but nobody

01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:57.680
says, oh, yee.

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:06.640
Anyway, chapter 20.

01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:14.320
All day, I wondered what the surprise was. Meanwhile, I popped on a black letter mini,

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:21.520
a black corset with orbo lace stuff all over it, and black gothic compact boots.

01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:29.680
MCR were going to the concert again, since Volxamort has taken over the last one.

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:36.560
I slipped my wrists while I moshed to MCR in my bedroom all night, feeling excited.

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:39.360
So wait, she's just like in her bedroom, you know,

01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:46.080
using it, making ketchup packets, and then she just throws her body around her room.

01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:51.200
Just moshing. Didn't Draco die? No, he didn't die. He just took out a knife,

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:55.280
and then I guess, and then Dumbledore just like showed up and didn't kill.

01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:59.360
Yeah, and so he didn't die. Draco's alive. He's fine.

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:06.560
Dumbledore has his priorities straight. She sleeps in a dorm. Well, she has her own bedroom with Willow.

01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:10.480
So it's her and her roommate Willow, okay?

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:23.760
Where did I lost my spot? I'm excited. Suddenly someone knocked on the door while I was trying

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:30.800
some black clothes and moshing to fang you for Da Venom. I got all mad in turn of, but scarredly,

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:40.960
sacredly, I hopped inside that it was Draco, so we could do it again.

01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:46.320
What the fucking hell are you doing? I shouted angrily.

01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:52.720
It was Lupin. Are you gonna call me? Or what? I yelled.

01:02:55.200 --> 01:03:02.480
Are you gonna share some grape juice with me or what? I yelled. I was allowed to say that

01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:06.480
because Dumbledore had told us all to be careful around him and snap since he was a pedo.

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:16.480
No, actually. Get it, hell. Can I please borrow some condoms?

01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:28.400
He growled angrily. Yeah, so you can fuck your six-year-old girlfriend? Huh? I said this

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:36.880
sarcastically. Fuck her, he said, gong away. Well, anyway, I put on some black eyeshadow.

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:44.480
That sounds bad. Black eyeliner and some black lipstick and white foundation. Then I went. Then

01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:51.040
I gasped. Ellipses, ellipses, ellipses, ellipses, ellipses, ellipses, ellipses, ellipses. Snake

01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:57.280
and Lupin were in the middle of the empty hall doing it and Dobby was watching.

01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:07.760
Oh my god, you ludicrous idiot. They both

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:12.000
shooted angrily when they saw me. Dobby ran away crying.

01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:27.040
They got up though. Normally I would have been turned on. I love seeing guys do it.

01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:33.200
But both of them were fuking preps. By the way, Snake has moved to Gryffindor now.

01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:41.120
Why does she hate Snape so much? You'd think he's like the ultimate goth icon in Harry Potter.

01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:47.680
Why would you make Snake Snape a non-goth?

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:55.280
WTF? Is that why you wanted condoms? I asked sadistically. See, I spelled that.

01:04:55.680 --> 01:05:03.440
Yeah. She still doesn't. Only you wouldn't give them to me. Lumpkin shouted angrily.

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:13.520
While you should have told me, I replayed. You, you, damn it. Snake began to shoot angrily. And then

01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:21.440
Ellipses, I took out my black camera and took a pic of them. You can see that they were naked and

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:28.480
everything. Well, excuse me. They both shouted angrily. What was that all about?

01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:34.960
It was to blackmail you. I snarked. So now next time you see me doing it with my boyfriend,

01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:39.760
you can't fuking rat me out. I'll show this to Dumbledork. So fuk off you bastards.

01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:45.680
I started to run. They chased me, but I threw my wound at them and they tripped over.

01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:53.440
Wait, so translation. She threw her wand and they just tripped. Two grown ass men managed

01:05:53.440 --> 01:06:06.800
to both trip over a like six inch wand. Well, anyway, I went outside and there was vampire

01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:15.360
looking extremely fuking hot. WTF. Where'd Drake go? I asked him. My nose is itchy.

01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:27.440
Could be packing a bigger wand. Yeah, maybe her, her wand is just thick. She got a thick

01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:38.240
um's wand thicker than a snicker. Um, sorry, I just read the next line. Um, garsh. Oh,

01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:46.560
he's being a fuking bastard. He told me you wouldn't come. Huh? Vampire said shaking his head.

01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:49.200
You want to come me to the concert?

01:06:54.800 --> 01:07:03.760
Then he showed me his flying car. I gasped. It was a black car. He said his dogfather's.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:14.240
Wait, is that like a joke because Serious Black is a werewolf? His dogfather?

01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:18.880
Is that a thing in the books? I've never read the books or seen the movies really. So

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:30.480
um, has given it to him. The license plate on the front said MCR666 on it. The one on the back

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:39.440
said a no be on it. I gasped. We flew to the con. Like, okay, I just didn't say anything about it.

01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:44.880
I just gasped. Where is everybody getting these vanity plates? You know, these vanity plates are

01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:54.480
very expensive. Um, at least in America. We flew to the concert hall. MCR were there playing. Vampire

01:07:54.480 --> 01:08:00.160
and I began to make out, moshing to the music. Oh, so she just cheated on her fuking boyfriend.

01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:03.280
What a bitch. Andy Arbrose are going to eat this shit up.

01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:14.240
I gasped looking at the band. I almost had an orgasm. Geron was so fuking hot.

01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:18.800
He began to sing Helena. And that's the only song she fuking knows by MCR. I swear to God.

01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:25.360
And his sexy, beautiful voice began to fill the hall. Ellipses. And then I heard some crying.

01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:31.120
I turned and saw Draco crying in a corner because he saw me cheating on her.

01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:40.560
Oh, please. If somebody, did she be cotton bum for their license plate? Somehow I would,

01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:45.600
I would, I would do a backflip. I'm not even joking. I'll do a backflip if that happens.

01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:50.320
No, actually, no, I can't do a backflip, please. I haven't done a backflip for a long time

01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:52.800
since gymnastics. Please, no.

01:08:57.040 --> 01:09:00.640
I was sitting in the cock corner. He was in the cock dirt, in the cock chair.

01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:08.800
All right. Chapter 21. Is there a cat on my chair? I feel like I hear scratching.

01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:13.840
No. Okay, I'm just making sure that my cat isn't like being like, hey, pick me up.

01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:23.200
Oh, my head edges. She be CB. Well, you don't have to, you can make it, you know, different.

01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:33.680
It could just put she be bum. But how do you backflip with your back problems? I don't know.

01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:39.520
That's why I said never mind. I was like, my back hurts so bad while I was vacuuming. I'm like,

01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:45.120
wow, I'm really, I'm really getting up there in age. I can't, when I hit 57, I'm probably just

01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:55.600
going to explode. Later, we all went in the skull. Draco was in the common room. Draco, are you okay?

01:09:56.320 --> 01:10:02.560
I asked him, oh, sorry. Draco, are you okay? I asked him the gothic voice. I guess my gothic voice,

01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:10.240
I guess. No, I'm not you fucking bitch. He shouted angrily. He stated to run out of the place in a

01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:16.080
suicidal way. I shouldn't have said that word because of fucking YouTube and on the live and

01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:24.560
Minecraft way. I stated to cry because I was afraid he would commit seppuku.

01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:33.680
She cheated on her and she has something to ask. I know I'm like, dude, what's wrong? You only saw

01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:43.680
me kissing your ex-boyfriend because this is a weird love triangle. Don't permit the suise doll.

01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:48.880
That's actually pretty good, the suise doll.

01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:52.000
Oh, okay.

01:10:55.280 --> 01:11:03.280
It's okay, you know me. Vampire said comfortably, I'll make him feel better.

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:12.960
You mean you'll go fuck him, won't you? I shouted, girl, you just kissed him in front of Draco. You

01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:23.280
literally just cheated, you have no right to act this way. Oh my god.

01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:32.480
Then I ran to get Draco. Vampire came too. Draco, please wait. Who's talking?

01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:40.800
I'm just gonna say it as a nobody. Draco, please come. He began to cry. Tears of blood came down

01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:48.080
as pale as in like a pale you put sand in face. I was so turned on because I love sensitive

01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:57.600
by guys. If you're a homophobe, then fuck off. Yeah, I get so turned on watching men cry. Tears of blood.

01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:08.400
And then ellipses, ellipses, ellipses, ellipses, ellipses, ellipses.

01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:15.120
We heard, like heard as in like cows, by the way, some footsteps. Vampire got out his black

01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:27.600
invincibility coke. Like, is it a drug or is it? Or is it the fucking? Or is it like a Coca-Cola?

01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:37.520
Oh, I apologize if anybody donated. I have my, I don't mind wearing my headphones.

01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:43.360
Um, wait, nobody told me that nothing, no music was playing.

01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:50.800
Video, why is the video pause? Has it been up and playing this entire time?

01:12:55.040 --> 01:13:01.040
I'll just replay the same video. Let's go. Okay.

01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:14.560
Okay. But thank you, BlackSilence26 for the tip from earlier. Here's a reward for cleaning your house.

01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:17.040
Madame, thank you. Thank you.

01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:26.320
I thought silence is for ambience and drama. I'm so folk. Okay, okay. That's good at least. That's good.

01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:43.920
We both got under it. We saw the janitor, Mr. Norris there, shouting angrily with the flashlight in his hand.

01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:53.520
He shouted angrily. We saw Filth come. He went under the invisibility cloak and started to meow loudly.

01:13:54.480 --> 01:14:01.920
Wait, is it Mrs. Norris, the cat? Does she just get the characters messed up?

01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:06.560
I thought there was like a teacher that could turn into a cat. It was a cat's name, Filth.

01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:12.640
Chuck Norris is here. She messes up the names. Okay.

01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:14.720
Um,

01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:16.720
Hey, shout out to you one day.

01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:18.320
Y'all, Mr. Norris.

01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:25.280
No, fuck you, you preppy little loser-poser son of a fucking bitch.

01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:31.200
Y'all, vampire senator, is breast in a disgusted way.

01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:41.440
Oh, that's a bit of a gongal. Okay. I don't fucking know. What is the cat called, Filth?

01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:43.120
What is the cat called, Filth?

01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:55.280
Um, excuse me, excuse me, who said that? Y'all, Mr. Norris, then he heard Filth meow.

01:14:56.320 --> 01:15:01.200
Filth, is there anyone under the cloak? Wait, he knows the cloak is there.

01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:04.800
It was like, is anyone there? Is there just a random invisibility cloak?

01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:10.480
Then nobody can be possibly under, although I heard something. Oh my gosh, hi, Reina.

01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:17.280
Reina, what's up, girlie pop? You coming to snuggle? Oh my god, you're coming to snuggle with me?

01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:26.880
Really? Oh my god, yes, queen. Thank you. Reina has joined the fray.

01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:30.640
She is rubbing against the microphone.

01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:38.400
She is rumbling. She's headbutting the mic. Her chest is wet because she must have just

01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:41.040
decided to swim in her water bowl.

01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:47.040
She's purring so well.

01:15:47.360 --> 01:16:07.120
All right, she's sitting on my shoulder now. Let's continue.

01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:19.920
Filth nodded, and then ellipses, ellipses, ellipses. Vampir franched me.

01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:23.920
He did it just as Mr. Norris was taking off the cloak.

01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:30.720
What the? He yelled, but it was too late now because we were running away from him.

01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:37.680
And then we saw Draco crying and busting into tears and slipping and making catch

01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:46.960
of packets outside the school. Draco, I cried. Are you okay? I guessed. I guessed, though.

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:57.440
Draco wept. We went back to our coffins, frenching each other. Where the fuck did vampire go?

01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:07.280
Draco and I decided to watch Lake Placid see isn't that depressing on the gothic red bed together

01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:14.560
as I was about to put on the video in the video. What? What is happening? My eyes rolled up and

01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:19.280
suddenly I had a vision of something that was happening. Now there was a knock on the door and

01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:26.000
Fug and a mystery of magic walked into the school. Draco as in Soldier Boy? Sure.

01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:35.360
Okay. Chapter 22.

01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:47.840
Draco couldn't hold his edge in bust. Here's 44 chapters of this.

01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:50.640
Um.

01:17:55.040 --> 01:18:01.040
All day, everyone talked about the misery of magic. Well, anyway, I woke up the next day.

01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:08.560
I'm scared. I was in my coffin so I opened the door. I was wearing black lacy leather pajama.

01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:14.080
Who wears leather pajamas to bed? Who does this? Then I gasped.

01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:17.120
We're gonna do the gasped noise.

01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:24.720
No. Okay. She's just gonna burn to the microphone.

01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:32.080
Real gobs too. You're right. You're right. I'm gonna start wearing leather to bed.

01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:36.640
I'll get some latex leather. Just be like only in bed like that.

01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:46.480
Standing in front of me wear Bloody Mary, Vampire, Diabolo, Draco, Dracula and Willow.

01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:53.600
I opened my crimson eyes. Wait, were they close? How did they know? Willow was. Oh, great. Here we go,

01:18:53.600 --> 01:19:00.480
everybody. Buckle in for the outfits. Willow was wearing, I'm saying this in my normal voice.

01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:05.200
Willow was wearing a tight black leather top with pictures of bloody roses all over it.

01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:10.960
Under that, she warped a black poofy skirt with lace on it and black gothic boots that was attached

01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:20.080
to the top. What? Vampire was wearing a baggy simple plan t-shirt and baggy black pants and vans.

01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:27.920
Draco was wearing a black MCR t-shirt and black... Why did a Windows thing just pop up? I don't care

01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:37.360
about Windows 11. Remind, why did that just pop up randomly? Sorry. Windows had something to say.

01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:45.280
Draco was wearing a black MCR t-shirt and black jeans and a leather jacket.

01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:53.200
He looked just like a Gerard Way and almost as fucking sexy. Vampire looked like Joel Madden.

01:19:55.280 --> 01:20:01.440
Bloody Mary. I just thought of like, like, like e-sports. I mean, not e-sports, or just like,

01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:10.880
um, what the fuck? Just like, one of the football games are just Madden. Yeah, just just Madden,

01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:16.960
the game. Bloody Mary was wearing a tight black poofy gothic dress that she had ripped it,

01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:23.040
so it showed all of her clerage with a white apron that said, bitch, mother swear words.

01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:29.040
She's so, she's like essentially dressed like Alice the Madness, but then just has stuff written

01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:35.440
all over her apron. Um, mother swear words and MCR lyrics on it kind of like, kind of like one

01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:43.360
dress I had seen Amy Lee wear once. Darkness, who is Jenny, was there too. She was weaving a ripped

01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:48.560
gothic black dress with ripped stuff all over an lace-up top thing in black pointy boots.

01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:55.440
So were Crab and Goyle. It turns out that Darkness, Diabolo, Crab and Goyle's dad was a vampire.

01:20:55.440 --> 01:21:05.920
He committed, uh, Suisse doll by making ketchup with a razor. He had given them grape juice and

01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:11.360
stuff before too. They all got so depressed that they became gothic and converted to stanism.

01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:20.640
Not enough all thank you, yeah. Yeah, they became K-pop stans.

01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:35.680
So basically everyone in Slytherin has the same backstory, essentially, yeah.

01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:42.800
Oh, I'm FG. I yielded as I jumped up. Why the fuck are you all here?

01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:50.640
And no be, wait, and no be something has really fucked up. Draco said, okay, but I need to put

01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:59.040
on my fucking clothes first. I shouted angrily. It's all right. We have to go now and you look

01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:04.880
kawaii anyway. You are so fucking beautiful. Draco said in a sexy voice.

01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:13.520
Oh, all right. I said smiling, but you have to tell me why you're being all erective.

01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:23.280
I will, I will, he said. So I didn't, Reyna, why are you, she's like in the weirdest position right

01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:32.080
now. Reyna, why are you sitting like that? Okay. I brushed you this morning and you're shedding

01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:44.080
so much. Let's do some brush ASMR. I literally vacuumed and there was so much hair. Oh, there's

01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:53.520
now you're getting cozy. Oh, okay. Perfect. You just hang out just like that.

01:22:56.080 --> 01:23:01.920
She wants to listen. She was like, Reyna has this weird thing where she'll like

01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:09.120
sit her butt on me, but then like stand up. Like, but it's like uneven. So like, okay, imagine you're

01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:15.920
like on a stair and this cat is on a stair, but the butt is on the top stair and their feet are

01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:20.960
just like standing on the bottom stair and she just like uses parts of me as like a little shelf to

01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:28.560
put her ass on. So I just don't understand why she sits like that. She was doing that on one leg

01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:34.000
to my other leg because my legs were uneven. But yeah, I hope that makes sense to you.

01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:44.960
So I just put on some black eyeliner, black lipstick and black and red eyeshadow and white

01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:54.240
foundation. Then I came. We all went in front of your friends. Come on, girl. There's a time and a

01:23:54.240 --> 01:24:01.200
place. We all went outside to the great hell and looked in from a widow, a fucking prep called Brittany.

01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:07.680
This is supposed to be Brittany Spears, by the way, from Gryffindor. Brittany Spears is canonically

01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:14.320
Gryffindor was standing next to us. She was wearing a pink mini and a Hillary Duff T-shirt. So we put

01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:20.880
up our middle fingers at her inside the great hall. We could also see Dumbledork. Cornelia fudged

01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:26.960
was there shouting at Dumbledore. Doris Rumbridge was there too. This could not be. She said it

01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:34.080
angrily. The school must be closed. The barclaw is planning to kill the students yelled Cornelia fudge.

01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:40.880
You are not fit to be principal any longer yelled Rumbridge. You are too old and your Alzheimer's

01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:47.920
is dangerous. You must retry or Voldemort will kill your students. What the fudge?

01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:56.240
Very well. Dumbledore said angrily. But we cannot do this. We cannot close the school. There is

01:24:56.240 --> 01:25:01.760
only one person who is capable of killing Voldemort and she is in the school. And her name is

01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:12.160
Anoni Darkness Dementia Raven Way. Draco Crabgoyle Darkness Willow Vampire and Bloody Mary and

01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:20.320
everybody else at the fucking school apparently looked at each other. I gasped. Alzheimer's

01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:24.320
Yeah, I don't know. They just they just say he has Alzheimer's.

01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:31.440
Oh, this is what she looks like by the way. If you guys didn't in the corner right over here,

01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:36.480
you can kind of see the hair. I'm going on.

01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:48.720
Chapter 23. The door opened and Professor Rumbridge and Cornelia fudge. That's an awesome last name

01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:57.200
stomped out angrily. Then Dumbledome and Rumbridge sawed us in half because not like saw as in like

01:25:57.200 --> 01:26:09.360
saw you. Sawed as in with a hardware tool, by the way. Chow's in one. She looks like a prep. Yep,

01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:16.160
yep, she does. Mr. Way. What the beep are you doing? Rumbridge. Wait.

01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:22.640
Why did she call him Mr. Way? Is Dumbledore's last name

01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:30.400
Way? Is he secretly Jared Way's brother? No, Reina, don't leave. Okay, she went and hopped in her bed.

01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:38.080
Okay. Okay.

01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:49.360
Oops. She made a mistake. Sorry. Dumbledore blared at her. Not glared blared. Oops. She made it. Wait.

01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:58.000
What the fuck? I totally. It doesn't matter. She means hi. Everybody come in. See you and by the

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:08.080
way, everybody has to come. There's a mistake. I have to make sure.

01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:13.760
My chair squeaky. I need to burp.

01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:23.520
Well, we all came in angrily. So did all the other students just in this big ass office.

01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:28.080
I sat between darkness and Draco and opposite Bloody Mary. Crab and Goyle started to make some

01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:39.440
morbid jokes. They both looked exactly like Vile Volo. What? Who's Vile Volo? I don't know.

01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:47.920
I ate the number. Some Count Chocula and Drake some blood from a cup. Where is she getting this?

01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:55.680
Then I heard someone shooting angrily at a school. Come on. Put it away, bro.

01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:00.080
I looked behind me. It was vampire. Great vampires.

01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:10.640
Doing stuff at the school. Oh, okay. Got you. I have never, I had never seen the person. I don't

01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:15.040
think I've heard of that band. I have to look that up. I probably listen to their songs, but I just

01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:24.480
never heard of the meme. Here, Draco, we're shooting at each other. Why are they shooting?

01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:35.120
Vampire Draco WTF? I asked. You fucking bastard. Y'all, Draco had vampire. I want to shit next to her.

01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:46.640
No, I do. I'm a vampire shouted. No, she doesn't like you, you son of a bitch. Y'all, Draco.

01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:56.160
No, fuck you, motherfucker. She laughs me, not you. Y'all shouted vampire. And then he jumped on Draco.

01:28:56.160 --> 01:29:00.080
No, and not in that way, you perv. They started to fight and beat up each other.

01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:07.120
Dumbledore yelled at them, but they didn't stop. All of a sudden, a terrible man with red eyes and no, no.

01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:18.080
I want to say someone's name so bad as a joke, but I don't want their pants to come from me.

01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:30.560
Insert with a vtuber of your choice. He had no nose and was wearing a gray robe.

01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:37.600
All the glass in the window he flew through fell apart. Britney, that fucking prep started to cry.

01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:44.960
Vampire Draco stopped fighting. I shopped eating. Everyone gasped. The room fell silent.

01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:52.880
Full Zemort. Do it, Shibani. No, Shibani. Shibani doesn't. I don't want to. I don't want to get

01:29:52.880 --> 01:30:08.320
Sheebie in trouble. Eboby, Ebony, Darth Vader. Wait. Where did Darth Vader come from? Why is Darth Vader here?

01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:28.640
I thought it was Voldemort. No, it's Darth Vader. Said it in his evil, in his raspy voice.

01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:32.080
Thou hast failed your mission.

01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:48.000
No, I shall kill Thou, and I shall kill Vampire as well. If Thou does not kill him before,

01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:57.360
then I shall kill Draco too. Please don't make me kill him, please. I begged.

01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:05.360
No. He laughed crudely. Kill him, or I shall kill him anyway.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:14.720
Then he flew away cackling. Dirt Vruder. Made it as an impure new day to day life. I guess not.

01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:24.880
I bust into tears. Draco and Vampire came to contort me.

01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:34.320
Oh, let's do some contort. Suddenly my eyes rolled up, so they all looked so cool and gothic.

01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:43.680
Am I cool and gothic?

01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:57.280
I had a vision where I saw some lightning flash and then Voldemort coming to kill Draco. Will Draco

01:31:58.400 --> 01:32:02.160
made some ketchup packets on his wrist in a depressed way?

01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:15.440
Hey. I'll contort you. No. I screamed sexily. Suddenly I locked up and stopped having the vision.

01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:19.360
Ebony. Ebony. Ebony.

01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:25.280
Excuse you honking your horn outside. I don't know if anybody else heard that.

01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:31.200
Ebony. Ebony. Are you all right? Ask Draco in a worried voice.

01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:37.200
Yeah. Yeah. I said sadly as I got up. Everything's all right and no me.

01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:49.120
Vampire all senesitive. No, it's not. I shouted angrily. Tears of blood went down my face.

01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:52.720
OMG. What if I'm getting possessed like in the ring too?

01:32:54.240 --> 01:33:00.640
It's okay girl. I said Bloody Mary. Maybe you should ask Professor Sinister about what the visions

01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:08.480
mean though. Okay bitch. I said sadly. Okay bitch. I said sadly and then we win.

01:33:10.720 --> 01:33:12.240
Chapter 24.

01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:25.920
Well, we had deviation. Deviation. Divination. Deviation of a septum. Next. So I got to ask

01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:35.840
Professor Travolry about the visions. Konnichiwa everybody come in.

01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:42.800
I'll use another kawaii voice for everybody. Yeah, it's Sinister.

01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:50.000
What is it I need to do? I'll give her, I'll give her like a, I don't know, like what does she have

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:55.760
like a northern UK accent? I don't, I can't, it's essentially Scottish or she's Scottish. I can't

01:33:55.760 --> 01:34:06.000
recall. Konnichiwa everybody come in. I said Professor Sinister in Japanese. What was that in

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:13.920
English? She smelled at me with her gothic black lipstick. She's the coolest fucking teacher ever.

01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:20.720
She had long dead black hair with blood red tips and red eyes. Her mama's a vampire. She's also

01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:26.640
half Japanese so she speaks it in everything. She and Bloody Mary get along great. She's really

01:34:26.640 --> 01:34:33.040
young for a teacher. Who is supposed, who is this supposed to be? Who, who teaches divination in the,

01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:39.920
in the books? She's Russian but moved to Scotland. Oh, interesting. Okay, I can't do

01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:48.240
Scottish accent but I'll try my best. Today she was wearing black leather top with red lace and

01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:54.320
long gothic black rip dress. We went inside the black classroom with pastors of Emily the Strong.

01:34:54.320 --> 01:35:02.080
I don't, who is that? Emily the Strong? I raced my hand. I was wearing some black naipolite Polish

01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:10.160
the country, the, the nationality, the ethnicity with red pentagrams on it.

01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:17.680
What is it happening? Yes. Hey, I love your naipolite. When did you get to talk topic?

01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:25.760
Yeah, I answered all the preps who didn't know what HT was gave me weird looks. I gave them

01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:32.080
middle finger. I wish I had my hand cam on because then when I, I would just, I would just flip you

01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:40.480
guys off. Um, well, I have to talk about to you about some things. When do you want to do it?

01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:49.520
How about now? She asked. Okay, I said. Okay, class fucking dismissed everyone.

01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:56.400
Professor Trevoree said, and she let everyone go except, except for you, Brittany. She pointed

01:35:56.400 --> 01:36:05.120
up Brittany and some other preps. Please do exercise. Get it. One on page three. Exercise.

01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:10.640
Wait, is Professor Sinister and Professor Trevoree the same person?

01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:15.520
It's not too late to hand cam. Yeah, I'd have to set all the shit up.

01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:25.920
I'd be like, do it. Like, no, it was actually due as in like a paper is due. So yeah. Okay.

01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:38.160
Please do exercise. One on page three. Okay, I'm having lots of visions. I said in a worried voice.

01:36:38.160 --> 01:36:45.040
I'm so worried. Draco is going to die. Well, she gave me a black crypt tall ball to lock in.

01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:49.040
I looked at it. What day to see? She asked.

01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:57.600
I said, I see a black, she got like some quotes like she's saying that

01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:04.480
black gothic skull and a pentagram. Suddenly there was a knock on the door. I looked at it.

01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:08.400
It was Draco. He was looking really sexy wearing a black leather facet.

01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:16.000
Is that supposed to be jacket facet? A black gothic Lincoln Park t-shirt and black

01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:23.200
Congress shoes, not converse Congress. Okay, you can go now see a con.

01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:24.800
Professor.

01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:35.600
Bye, bitch. I said waving.

01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:42.960
I went to Draco and vampire was sitting next to him. We both fall drink.

01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:49.840
I like a hiccup yard at the same time. Draco together and I was so exhibited.

01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:52.160
Congress.

01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:59.760
Wait, Congress shoes are real? It's not the Jedi way, no respect for her teacher.

01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:04.240
Well, she, the teacher said, okay, you can go now see a con. So

01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:09.360
all right, chapter 25.

01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:19.360
I was so excited. I fellow Draco wondering if we were going to do it again.

01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:24.080
We went outside. Wait, isn't, I thought vampire was also following us.

01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:30.960
We went outside and then we went into Draco's black car.

01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:34.480
I've been in with the fuck did Professor Trivalry say?

01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:43.280
Whispered Draco potting his gothic wit hand with black nail polish on mine.

01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:50.960
Polish. Hold it. You get it. He was painting her nails. Yep.

01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:58.080
Oh, wait, no, he's, no, he wasn't painting her nails. He was just putting his painted hand,

01:38:58.080 --> 01:39:02.880
his nails, his nails are painted and his hands are white because he is a white boy.

01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:06.400
His nails are black and he was holding her hand. Okay, I get it.

01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:08.240
It's so black.

01:39:11.680 --> 01:39:14.640
She said she would tell me what the visions meant tomorrow.

01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:24.640
I grumbled in a sexy voice and he took out a heroin. What? Cabaret and spiked it and gave

01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:32.720
it to me to, what? He started to fly the car to the tree and to a tree. We went to the top of it.

01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:36.160
Draco potting his eyes. Are we doing heroin?

01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:49.440
What is happening? I don't even know. What the fuck is a cabaret? Like I felt like cabaret is a show.

01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:57.120
Oh, I knew we weren't filming.

01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:06.880
Okay.

01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:16.560
And all the things that you never ever told me and all the smiles that are ever gonna haunt me.

01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:22.160
I don't know the song saying Gerard's sexy voice. Then we started tilling off each other's

01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:31.360
clothes fevently. He took off my black thong and black leather bar, not a bra bar. I took off

01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:41.440
his black boxers. Then he put his traubing, you know what, in my tools. Oh my fucking God, Draco,

01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:48.160
I screamed having an orgasm. We started fringing passively. Suddenly I fell asleep.

01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:56.000
Dick's so good. He put her ass to sleep. Now they call in him Nyquil.

01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:02.160
I started tapping a tree.

01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:07.920
performer

01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:24.400
okay okay

01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:33.400
Okay, uh, isn't it a black guy who was shooting two Gothic men with long black hair?

01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:38.400
No, no, please don't fucking kill us. We're one direction.

01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:42.400
Just kidding, it doesn't say that. They pleaded, but he kept shooting them. He ran away.

01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:48.400
What is this racism? What did he run away to run a car?

01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:55.400
No, my fucking god. I showed it in a scaring movie.

01:41:55.400 --> 01:41:57.400
Ebony, what's wrong?

01:41:57.400 --> 01:42:06.400
Draco asked me as I woke up opening my icy blue eyes. I actually didn't know her eyes were blue. I thought they were red.

01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:11.400
I started to cry tears of blood out my face.

01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:16.400
I told Draco to call Vampire. He did it with this black Lincoln Park mobile.

01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:26.400
But two T's. The worst thing was who the people were shot in the dream were Lucian and Ciri.

01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:29.400
Are there any black people in Harry Potter?

01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:34.400
Why is there a red and black dude? Just kidding.

01:42:34.400 --> 01:42:39.400
What is this?

01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:44.400
Should I get my gun ready? I don't...

01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:52.400
I think I just heard Boomi like meow to myself in his sleep. He was like...

01:42:52.400 --> 01:43:00.400
Do you think double four is black?

01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:05.400
J.K. Rowling said there's no black people in England.

01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:10.400
Is that a real fucking person in the books?

01:43:10.400 --> 01:43:15.400
Kingsley Shackboat? That's terrible.

01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:20.400
I hate the way J.K. Rowling names. It's so bad.

01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:27.400
Didn't she give an Asian character the most racist fucking name?

01:43:28.400 --> 01:43:32.400
Sorry, racist.

01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:40.400
This is gonna get... This is totally gonna get fucking demonetized.

01:43:40.400 --> 01:43:42.400
Oh, Kingsley Shackleford.

01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:47.400
Cho Chang. Yeah, who the fuck? That's a stupidest name.

01:43:47.400 --> 01:43:53.400
Like what? That's so bad.

01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:58.400
Oh, anyways, continuing on.

01:43:58.400 --> 01:44:00.400
Chapter 20... Wait.

01:44:00.400 --> 01:44:04.400
Chapter 26.

01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:07.400
A few mutates later, Vampire came to the tree.

01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:13.400
He was wearing a black leather Jackson, black leather pants and a good Charlotte t-shirt.

01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:19.400
Hi, Vampire. I said flutterly as I started to sob.

01:44:19.400 --> 01:44:22.400
Go hug me sexily. How do you hug sexily?

01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:25.400
She's crying. Stop trying to pull a move on her, dude.

01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:28.400
Triants to come frot me.

01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:30.400
Frotting?

01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:35.400
I started to cry tears of blood and told them what happened.

01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:40.400
Oh, gorse. Oh, fuck it.

01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:44.400
Vampire shouted angrily. He started to cry sadly.

01:44:44.400 --> 01:44:48.400
What fucking dick did that?

01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:53.400
I don't know. I said, now come on, we have to tell Dumbledore.

01:44:53.400 --> 01:44:58.400
We ran out of the tree and into the... Wait, we ran out of the tree?

01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:02.400
Aren't we like 50 feet up or like higher?

01:45:02.400 --> 01:45:06.400
Dumbledore was sitting in his office.

01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:10.400
Sire, our dads... Why did he call him Sire?

01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:12.400
Sire, our dads have been shot.

01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:15.400
Drake Cousin will be whipped.

01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:18.400
Whipped some tears from his white face.

01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:23.400
And nobody had a vision and a dream.

01:45:23.400 --> 01:45:27.400
Dumbledore started to cockle.

01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:32.400
What? Started to what now?

01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:35.400
Um...

01:45:35.400 --> 01:45:41.400
How do you expect me to know Ebony's not divisional?

01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:45.400
I cleared a Dumbledore.

01:45:45.400 --> 01:45:50.400
Is that supposed to say delusional?

01:45:50.400 --> 01:45:53.400
Divisional.

01:45:53.400 --> 01:45:56.400
Look, motherfucker.

01:45:56.400 --> 01:45:59.400
He said angrily.

01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:04.400
As Dumbledore gasped, see is that toot of cracker.

01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:08.400
You know very well that I'm not decisional.

01:46:08.400 --> 01:46:16.400
Now get some fucking people out there to look for Ceres and Lucian Ponto.

01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:20.400
Okay, he said an imitated voice, an intimated voice.

01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:23.400
Where are they?

01:46:23.400 --> 01:46:26.400
I fought about it. I fought about it.

01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:31.400
Then all of a sudden, long done.

01:46:31.400 --> 01:46:34.400
I said, I told him which street.

01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:37.400
He went and called some people and did some stuff.

01:46:37.400 --> 01:46:42.400
After a few mis-tunes, he came back and said people were going out looking for them.

01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:44.400
After a while, someone called him again.

01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:46.400
He said that they have been found.

01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:48.400
Jesus Christ, that was fast.

01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:50.400
You know, good on Dumbledore for that.

01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:53.400
Draco, Vampire, and I all left our rooms together.

01:46:53.400 --> 01:46:56.400
I went with Draco to wait in the nurse's office.

01:46:56.400 --> 01:47:01.400
Why? Well, Vampire went to make some catch-up packets in his room.

01:47:01.400 --> 01:47:06.400
We looked at each other's gothic, depressive eyes.

01:47:06.400 --> 01:47:08.400
Then we kissed.

01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:15.400
Suddenly, Ceres and Lucian came in on stretchers and Professor Sinister was behind them.

01:47:15.400 --> 01:47:26.400
I like how Professor Sinister never, like, explained the vision we had.

01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:28.400
Clip that, clip that.

01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:32.400
I need, I please, can someone make a compilation of me reading my immortal?

01:47:32.400 --> 01:47:35.400
Please, please, please, I beg of you.

01:47:36.400 --> 01:47:39.400
Everyone in the room, Chapter 27.

01:47:41.400 --> 01:47:44.400
Everyone in the room stated to cry happily.

01:47:44.400 --> 01:47:46.400
I had saved them.

01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:49.400
Draco, Lucian, Serious Bond.

01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:52.400
Serious Bond?

01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:55.400
Like, is he James Bond?

01:47:55.400 --> 01:47:57.400
Vampire all came to hug me.

01:47:57.400 --> 01:48:00.400
The nurse started to give them medicine.

01:48:01.400 --> 01:48:07.400
Come on a nobie, said Professor Sinatra.

01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:19.400
She was wearing a gothic black leader dress with a corset top and real vampire blood on it.

01:48:19.400 --> 01:48:20.400
Wait, why would she?

01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:23.400
So that means she killed a vampire and put blood on it?

01:48:23.400 --> 01:48:26.400
And fuking black platinum boots.

01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:29.400
I have to tell you the fucking perdition.

01:48:29.400 --> 01:48:32.400
I locked at Lucian Serifs.

01:48:33.400 --> 01:48:35.400
Like the font.

01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:36.400
Drake?

01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:37.400
Drake?

01:48:37.400 --> 01:48:38.400
Drake's here?

01:48:38.400 --> 01:48:40.400
Where did Drake get here?

01:48:40.400 --> 01:48:42.400
Didn't you get your ass beat by Kendrick?

01:48:42.400 --> 01:48:44.400
What the fuck are you doing here, bro?

01:48:45.400 --> 01:48:47.400
Vampire, they nodded.

01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:55.400
I smelled happily and went into a dark room.

01:48:55.400 --> 01:48:56.400
I had changed.

01:48:56.400 --> 01:48:59.400
Professor Sinatra took out some black cards.

01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:01.400
That's a lot of sentence.

01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:04.400
She started to look into a black crucible ball.

01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:06.400
She said, Terra.

01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:09.400
Who the fuck is Terra?

01:49:09.400 --> 01:49:10.400
Oh wait, no.

01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:16.400
We did, I think we said our name was, we added Terra before Way before.

01:49:16.400 --> 01:49:19.400
And like when I was introducing myself.

01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:21.400
Okay, Drake Bell.

01:49:21.400 --> 01:49:24.400
It's Drake, Drake and Josh.

01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:28.400
Nah, I'd like to think it was Drake, the rapper Drake.

01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:30.400
Um, Terra.

01:49:30.400 --> 01:49:32.400
I see Drac times are near.

01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:33.400
She said badly.

01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:36.400
She peered into de balls.

01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:39.400
Drop your pants.

01:49:39.400 --> 01:49:43.400
You see, you must go back in time.

01:49:43.400 --> 01:49:47.400
She took out a time toner like Bloody Mary had.

01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:53.400
When Voldemort was in Hogwarts before he became powerful, he got his heart broken.

01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:58.400
Now do you think he would still become Voldemort if he was in love?

01:49:58.400 --> 01:50:00.400
I shook my head.

01:50:00.400 --> 01:50:03.400
You must go back in time and seduce him.

01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:05.400
It is the only way.

01:50:05.400 --> 01:50:09.400
If he is still evil, then you must kill him.

01:50:09.400 --> 01:50:11.400
I don't know why I lost the accent.

01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:15.400
You can come to my room tomorrow and you can do it.

01:50:15.400 --> 01:50:16.400
Okay.

01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:18.400
I said sadly.

01:50:18.400 --> 01:50:23.400
We did death touch sin.

01:50:23.400 --> 01:50:26.400
What is death touch sin?

01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:28.400
We did death touch sin.

01:50:28.400 --> 01:50:30.400
Death touch sin.

01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:31.400
Death touch sin.

01:50:31.400 --> 01:50:33.400
What is that?

01:50:33.400 --> 01:50:35.400
I'm picturing her like doing like devil horns.

01:50:35.400 --> 01:50:37.400
Hold on.

01:50:43.400 --> 01:50:45.400
Where is it?

01:50:49.400 --> 01:50:51.400
Where is it?

01:50:51.400 --> 01:50:53.400
Where is it?

01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:55.400
Where is it?

01:50:57.400 --> 01:51:02.400
So I'm picturing two hands.

01:51:04.400 --> 01:51:06.400
Just like doing this.

01:51:06.400 --> 01:51:07.400
Hold on.

01:51:07.400 --> 01:51:09.400
Let me grab another.

01:51:13.400 --> 01:51:16.400
I don't know why I named this straight jacket.

01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:18.400
Oh, I forgot to flip it.

01:51:18.400 --> 01:51:19.400
It's fine.

01:51:19.400 --> 01:51:21.400
You get the idea.

01:51:21.400 --> 01:51:26.400
My computer is just like, why did you add more assets?

01:51:26.400 --> 01:51:27.400
Rock on.

01:51:27.400 --> 01:51:29.400
Homie G's.

01:51:34.400 --> 01:51:37.400
Poor PC, yeah.

01:51:37.400 --> 01:51:38.400
Okay.

01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:40.400
Where did the thing go?

01:51:41.400 --> 01:51:43.400
Where's it?

01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:49.400
What the strike working?

01:51:49.400 --> 01:51:56.400
Go back in time and seduce him.

01:51:56.400 --> 01:52:00.400
I'm going back in time and I'm seducing it.

01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:02.400
Okay.

01:52:02.400 --> 01:52:03.240
Okay.

01:52:06.420 --> 01:52:09.920
What fucking happened as Draco and Vampire?

01:52:09.920 --> 01:52:10.960
Yeah, what happened?

01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:13.840
As darkness willow and bloody Mary, question mark.

01:52:13.840 --> 01:52:15.160
I need to drink the water.

01:52:18.160 --> 01:52:21.520
I was about to tell them, but everyone was there.

01:52:21.520 --> 01:52:24.800
They were celebrating Lucy and his serious being fond.

01:52:24.800 --> 01:52:28.300
Everyone was proud of me, but I just wanted to talk to Draco.

01:52:29.300 --> 01:52:33.620
They were teasing my name and some reporters were there

01:52:33.620 --> 01:52:35.860
trying to interview Dumbledore.

01:52:35.860 --> 01:52:37.240
A banner was put up.

01:52:37.240 --> 01:52:39.100
Lots of fucking preps were there.

01:52:39.100 --> 01:52:41.780
Obviously trying to be gothic

01:52:41.780 --> 01:52:44.780
wearing the hymn sign on their hands,

01:52:44.780 --> 01:52:48.860
despite not having actually heard of him.

01:52:48.860 --> 01:52:50.940
Even Mr. Norris looked happy.

01:52:50.940 --> 01:52:53.460
A black and red cake had been brought out.

01:52:53.460 --> 01:52:56.860
Crab and Goyk set up some fireworks

01:52:56.860 --> 01:53:00.420
and the shape of skulls from Wesley's Wizard Wises.

01:53:01.660 --> 01:53:04.820
I put on my invisibility Coke with Vampire and Draco

01:53:04.820 --> 01:53:07.020
and we sneaked outside together.

01:53:10.100 --> 01:53:11.220
Damn preps.

01:53:12.140 --> 01:53:12.980
Thank you.

01:53:12.980 --> 01:53:13.820
Okay, eight out of 10.

01:53:13.820 --> 01:53:14.660
All right, I'll take that.

01:53:14.660 --> 01:53:15.980
I'll take that.

01:53:15.980 --> 01:53:19.460
Wait, why is Shaggy in the top over here?

01:53:19.460 --> 01:53:20.500
Is that supposed to be?

01:53:20.500 --> 01:53:22.740
Oh, sorry, that's Diabolo.

01:53:22.740 --> 01:53:24.140
Okay, probably Ron.

01:53:25.140 --> 01:53:27.980
Okay.

01:53:27.980 --> 01:53:30.460
Chapter 28.

01:53:33.140 --> 01:53:35.700
We went into a black room.

01:53:35.700 --> 01:53:38.220
The walls were black with portraits of gothic bands

01:53:38.220 --> 01:53:41.740
like MCR, GC and Marilyn Manson all over them.

01:53:41.740 --> 01:53:43.940
A big black coffin was in the middle.

01:53:43.940 --> 01:53:44.780
Red velvet.

01:53:44.780 --> 01:53:46.980
I said in the middle, but it says the.

01:53:46.980 --> 01:53:50.940
Like that's how you know how messed up I am reading this.

01:53:50.940 --> 01:53:51.820
Red velvet.

01:53:51.820 --> 01:53:52.660
Oh, cute.

01:53:52.980 --> 01:53:54.060
Okay.

01:53:54.060 --> 01:53:55.700
Lined the black box.

01:53:56.580 --> 01:53:59.420
They were, there were three chairs made of bones

01:53:59.420 --> 01:54:01.180
with real skulls in them.

01:54:01.180 --> 01:54:04.060
I was wearing a black, did I spill water in between my legs?

01:54:04.060 --> 01:54:04.900
Why am I wet?

01:54:04.900 --> 01:54:06.940
Um, that sounds bad.

01:54:06.940 --> 01:54:09.580
I was wearing a black corset bar

01:54:09.580 --> 01:54:11.540
with purple stuff on it.

01:54:11.540 --> 01:54:14.780
Fishnet suckings and a black leather thong underneath.

01:54:14.780 --> 01:54:15.980
Was I wearing clothes?

01:54:17.860 --> 01:54:22.060
My, am I just wearing a thong and fishnets in a bra?

01:54:23.660 --> 01:54:28.260
That's pretty hardcore.

01:54:28.260 --> 01:54:31.980
So she looks like the average Vtuber.

01:54:31.980 --> 01:54:32.820
I love it.

01:54:33.980 --> 01:54:37.020
I sat down and wanted to chairs dispersedly.

01:54:37.020 --> 01:54:39.620
So did Draco and vampire.

01:54:39.620 --> 01:54:40.700
Are you okay?

01:54:40.700 --> 01:54:43.180
Wait, are you okay?

01:54:43.180 --> 01:54:47.580
Vampire asked potting his alabastered hand on mine.

01:54:47.580 --> 01:54:49.500
He was wearing black nail polish.

01:54:49.500 --> 01:54:52.580
I was wearing black nail polish with red crosses on it.

01:54:52.580 --> 01:54:54.260
Yeah, I guess, I said sadly.

01:54:54.260 --> 01:54:57.580
Draco also pot his hand on mine sexily.

01:54:57.580 --> 01:55:00.180
I smiled sadly with my black lipstick.

01:55:00.180 --> 01:55:04.740
The problem is, I have to seduce Volzemort.

01:55:04.740 --> 01:55:06.460
I'll have to go back in time.

01:55:07.340 --> 01:55:08.860
Draco started to cry sadly.

01:55:10.220 --> 01:55:11.300
Vampire hooked him.

01:55:14.580 --> 01:55:15.420
It's okay.

01:55:15.420 --> 01:55:19.980
I know it bo, it boby, it booby, it boby, it bobby.

01:55:19.980 --> 01:55:22.980
He said finally, but what about me?

01:55:22.980 --> 01:55:26.780
You're not gonna break up or anything, are you?

01:55:26.780 --> 01:55:28.620
Of course not.

01:55:30.180 --> 01:55:31.300
I guessed.

01:55:31.300 --> 01:55:32.620
Really?

01:55:32.620 --> 01:55:33.700
He asked.

01:55:33.700 --> 01:55:35.180
Sure, I said.

01:55:35.180 --> 01:55:39.540
Refrenched sexually, vampire looked at us longingly.

01:55:40.380 --> 01:55:41.460
Wait a second.

01:55:45.020 --> 01:55:46.300
Sorry, I just read ahead.

01:55:46.300 --> 01:55:47.140
Mom.

01:55:49.500 --> 01:55:52.460
Then I took off Draco's MCR,

01:55:52.460 --> 01:55:56.220
shrift, and seductively took off his pants.

01:55:56.220 --> 01:55:58.100
He was hung like a Stallone.

01:55:59.540 --> 01:56:03.900
He had replaced the vampire tattoo that said Ennobe on it.

01:56:03.900 --> 01:56:05.740
Black roses were around it.

01:56:05.740 --> 01:56:06.980
I gasped.

01:56:06.980 --> 01:56:09.380
He looked exactly like Gerard Way.

01:56:09.380 --> 01:56:11.540
Vampire took a video camera.

01:56:11.540 --> 01:56:13.740
I had said it was okay before.

01:56:13.740 --> 01:56:15.220
I took off my clothes.

01:56:15.260 --> 01:56:20.020
Then we were in for the ride of our life.

01:56:20.980 --> 01:56:24.300
We started freching as we climbed into the coffin.

01:56:24.300 --> 01:56:26.940
He put his spock in mine, you know what?

01:56:26.940 --> 01:56:28.780
Impassively we did it.

01:56:30.180 --> 01:56:32.460
I love you Ennobe, it boby.

01:56:32.460 --> 01:56:34.500
Oh, let me feel you, I need to feel you.

01:56:34.500 --> 01:56:37.100
He screamed as we got an orgasm.

01:56:37.100 --> 01:56:39.580
We watched vampire filmed everything perfectly.

01:56:39.580 --> 01:56:43.500
Suddenly, what the fuck are you doing?

01:56:43.500 --> 01:56:47.060
It was Snoop and Professor McGoggle.

01:56:47.060 --> 01:56:48.220
One, one, one.

01:56:49.780 --> 01:56:51.460
No, vampire was just a cock.

01:56:52.580 --> 01:56:54.620
Everybody points and laughs at the cook.

01:56:54.620 --> 01:56:57.020
Everybody points and laughs at the cook.

01:56:57.020 --> 01:57:02.020
Point and laugh at vampire Harry Potter, the cock.

01:57:06.780 --> 01:57:09.100
Chapter 29.

01:57:11.780 --> 01:57:12.620
Are you ready?

01:57:14.500 --> 01:57:19.500
Oh, my Satan, we screamed as we jammed out of the coffin.

01:57:19.500 --> 01:57:21.500
Snap and Professor McGoggle.

01:57:21.500 --> 01:57:22.500
McGoggle.

01:57:24.500 --> 01:57:27.500
Started to shoot at us angrily.

01:57:27.500 --> 01:57:32.500
Come now, preacher McGoggle yielded.

01:57:33.500 --> 01:57:35.500
We did it, killed the way.

01:57:37.500 --> 01:57:39.500
We did it, killed the way.

01:57:39.500 --> 01:57:41.500
We did it, killed the way.

01:57:41.500 --> 01:57:43.500
We did it, killed the way.

01:57:44.500 --> 01:57:45.500
We left the room.

01:57:45.500 --> 01:57:48.500
She just, she just came out of them to come

01:57:48.500 --> 01:57:51.500
and then they just came and I'm impressed.

01:57:54.500 --> 01:57:56.500
We left the room putting on her clothes.

01:57:56.500 --> 01:58:00.500
Snoop, Snoop dogs here.

01:58:00.500 --> 01:58:03.500
Garved the caramel and put it in his pocket.

01:58:04.500 --> 01:58:06.500
Hey, what the fuck?

01:58:06.500 --> 01:58:09.500
I'm a vampire shooting angrily.

01:58:12.500 --> 01:58:14.500
Yeah, Buster, what the fuck are you going to do

01:58:14.500 --> 01:58:16.500
with the fucking camera?

01:58:16.500 --> 01:58:19.500
Draco demonded, all protective,

01:58:19.500 --> 01:58:22.500
looking at me longly with his gothic red eyes.

01:58:22.500 --> 01:58:25.500
Look, Dumbledore knows your little secret

01:58:25.500 --> 01:58:28.500
and if you do this again, then you will go to St. Mango's.

01:58:28.500 --> 01:58:30.500
So give back to camera.

01:58:32.500 --> 01:58:34.500
The mystery of magic thinks he is crazy.

01:58:34.500 --> 01:58:36.500
There's no way a day will believe him.

01:58:36.500 --> 01:58:38.500
Snoop laughed meanly.

01:58:38.500 --> 01:58:40.500
There was no, there's no quotes.

01:58:40.500 --> 01:58:42.500
I couldn't tell who was talking.

01:58:43.500 --> 01:58:46.500
Yes, so shut your mouth, you m-m-m-m-poof.

01:58:46.500 --> 01:58:49.500
You in-losent fools.

01:58:49.500 --> 01:58:51.500
Yelled Professor McGoggle.

01:58:51.500 --> 01:58:56.500
She made us come into her room with white stones all around it.

01:58:56.500 --> 01:58:58.500
Looks like this is happening before.

01:58:58.500 --> 01:59:02.500
There was all these wh-what, we read tools in it.

01:59:02.500 --> 01:59:04.500
Draco started to cry all sexy.

01:59:04.500 --> 01:59:07.500
Oh, oh, oh.

01:59:07.500 --> 01:59:09.500
And sexative, get it?

01:59:09.500 --> 01:59:11.500
Cause he's a sex bomb, LOL.

01:59:11.500 --> 01:59:13.500
Tom fell not rules for life,

01:59:13.500 --> 01:59:16.500
but not as mugs, as Gerard,

01:59:16.500 --> 01:59:18.500
your sex on legs.

01:59:18.500 --> 01:59:21.500
I love you, you fucking rock, marry me.

01:59:24.500 --> 01:59:26.500
I don't know why I slept with you.

01:59:26.500 --> 01:59:31.500
I'm really bad accent when I have to read a lot of misspellings.

01:59:31.500 --> 01:59:33.500
I started to cry tears of blood.

01:59:33.500 --> 01:59:37.500
It happens in Vampire Chronicles, Raven said.

01:59:37.500 --> 01:59:39.500
So okay, so fuck you.

01:59:39.500 --> 01:59:41.500
Um, they actually, they cry,

01:59:41.500 --> 01:59:43.500
Vampires cry blood and true blood.

01:59:43.500 --> 01:59:45.500
One of my favorite guilty pleasure shows.

01:59:45.500 --> 01:59:48.500
Um, although I stopped watching after season six,

01:59:48.500 --> 01:59:50.500
cause it was just so bad.

01:59:50.500 --> 01:59:52.500
Um, Vampire took out,

01:59:52.500 --> 01:59:55.500
took out a black hunker chip chief

01:59:57.500 --> 02:00:00.500
and started to wipe my red eyes.

02:00:00.500 --> 02:00:05.500
And then he and Snoop both took out guns using magic.

02:00:05.500 --> 02:00:08.500
They started to shoot each other angrily.

02:00:08.500 --> 02:00:11.500
Hold on, I need to, I need to make sure I'm strapped.

02:00:14.500 --> 02:00:16.500
I need to make sure I'm strapped.

02:00:19.500 --> 02:00:21.500
Perfect.

02:00:22.500 --> 02:00:24.500
Uh-huh.

02:00:26.500 --> 02:00:27.500
Blau, blau.

02:00:37.500 --> 02:00:38.500
You like that?

02:00:38.500 --> 02:00:44.500
Um, none of the bullets got on each other yet.

02:00:44.500 --> 02:00:45.500
I took out my wand.

02:00:45.500 --> 02:00:47.500
This is my wand, as you can see.

02:00:47.500 --> 02:00:48.500
Cosio.

02:00:48.500 --> 02:00:51.500
I shouted snap, started to scrum and he dropped the gun,

02:00:51.500 --> 02:00:53.500
but it was too late.

02:00:53.500 --> 02:00:56.500
Both of them had run out of ballots, of bellies.

02:00:56.500 --> 02:00:58.500
I stopped to curse.

02:00:58.500 --> 02:01:02.500
Professor McGoogle did a spell so that we were all chained up.

02:01:02.500 --> 02:01:04.500
Ooh, she took out a box of tools.

02:01:04.500 --> 02:01:05.500
Then she said,

02:01:07.500 --> 02:01:10.500
Okay, Severus, I'm going to go now.

02:01:10.500 --> 02:01:11.500
She laughs.

02:01:11.500 --> 02:01:13.500
Snap started to laugh evilly.

02:01:13.500 --> 02:01:15.500
Vampire started to cry.

02:01:15.500 --> 02:01:17.500
It's okay, a nobie, said Draco.

02:01:17.500 --> 02:01:18.500
Evergreen.

02:01:19.500 --> 02:01:20.500
Who?

02:01:28.500 --> 02:01:29.500
You know what?

02:01:29.500 --> 02:01:31.500
I think she will be all right.

02:01:31.500 --> 02:01:34.500
Remember the city you took of Snake.

02:01:34.500 --> 02:01:36.500
Snape laughed again.

02:01:36.500 --> 02:01:39.500
And then he took out some whips.

02:01:45.500 --> 02:01:48.500
Bro, I hate this fucking dog, bro.

02:01:52.500 --> 02:01:56.500
This dog is always, like, always walks by yelling.

02:01:58.500 --> 02:01:59.500
I'll wait.

02:01:59.500 --> 02:02:01.500
I can wait.

02:02:01.500 --> 02:02:02.500
Teacher voice.

02:02:02.500 --> 02:02:04.500
I can wait.

02:02:04.500 --> 02:02:05.500
The bell doesn't dismiss you.

02:02:05.500 --> 02:02:07.500
I do, sweetheart.

02:02:07.500 --> 02:02:09.500
I can wait.

02:02:15.500 --> 02:02:33.500
I think the dog barks because it knows that there's people in their apartments.

02:02:33.500 --> 02:02:39.500
Oh, my God.

02:02:39.500 --> 02:02:44.500
Are we done?

02:02:45.500 --> 02:02:46.500
Is he done?

02:02:48.500 --> 02:02:50.500
Please, is he, is he done?

02:02:52.500 --> 02:02:53.500
Please let him, please.

02:02:53.500 --> 02:02:55.500
Okay, I think we're good.

02:02:55.500 --> 02:02:56.500
Bro, is he yapping?

02:02:56.500 --> 02:03:00.500
I think as he heard my voice, usually when you, and dogs have better hearing than humans,

02:03:00.500 --> 02:03:04.500
but you can kind of sometimes hear people if they're talking loudly.

02:03:05.500 --> 02:03:06.500
Okay.

02:03:07.500 --> 02:03:09.500
And took out some whips.

02:03:09.500 --> 02:03:10.500
Bark, bark, bark.

02:03:10.500 --> 02:03:12.500
Chapter 30.

02:03:13.500 --> 02:03:14.500
Oh.

02:03:16.500 --> 02:03:18.500
No, we screamed sadly.

02:03:18.500 --> 02:03:21.500
Snap stated loafing meanly.

02:03:22.500 --> 02:03:23.500
Are you fucking serious?

02:03:23.500 --> 02:03:25.500
He took out a camera, Anvilie.

02:03:25.500 --> 02:03:28.500
Then he came towards Darko.

02:03:28.500 --> 02:03:29.500
Tony Darko's here.

02:03:29.500 --> 02:03:32.500
He took some stones out of his pocket.

02:03:32.500 --> 02:03:37.500
He put the stones around Draco and knit a candle.

02:03:38.500 --> 02:03:40.500
Like, knit as in brightness.

02:03:40.500 --> 02:03:42.500
So then I guess that applies.

02:03:43.500 --> 02:03:45.500
What the fuck are you doing?

02:03:45.500 --> 02:03:46.500
I shoot it angrily.

02:03:46.500 --> 02:03:47.500
Pew, pew.

02:03:48.500 --> 02:03:49.500
Pew, pew.

02:03:49.500 --> 02:03:50.500
Bow, bow.

02:03:50.500 --> 02:03:51.500
Bow, bow.

02:03:51.500 --> 02:03:52.500
Put that away.

02:03:55.500 --> 02:03:56.500
I shoot it angrily.

02:03:58.500 --> 02:03:59.500
Uh.

02:04:02.500 --> 02:04:03.500
Where I lost my place.

02:04:06.500 --> 02:04:07.500
Snoop laughed meanly.

02:04:07.500 --> 02:04:09.500
He pulled down his pants.

02:04:09.500 --> 02:04:10.500
I gasped.

02:04:10.500 --> 02:04:12.500
There was a dark mark.

02:04:12.500 --> 02:04:15.500
A dark mark on his, you know what?

02:04:15.500 --> 02:04:16.500
What?

02:04:17.500 --> 02:04:18.500
I don't know what a dark.

02:04:18.500 --> 02:04:21.500
That's like the little like snake symbol, isn't it?

02:04:21.500 --> 02:04:22.500
I don't know.

02:04:23.500 --> 02:04:25.500
He waved his wand and a knife came.

02:04:25.500 --> 02:04:27.500
He spelled, she spelled a knife wrong.

02:04:27.500 --> 02:04:29.500
He gave the knife to me.

02:04:29.500 --> 02:04:32.500
You must romp here.

02:04:32.500 --> 02:04:36.500
He said to me, if you don't, then I'll wrap Draco.

02:04:37.500 --> 02:04:40.500
No, you fucking bastard.

02:04:40.500 --> 02:04:41.500
I yielded.

02:04:41.500 --> 02:04:44.500
But then Draco looked at me sadly with his evil,

02:04:44.500 --> 02:04:47.500
gothic red eyes that look so depressant and sexy.

02:04:47.500 --> 02:04:49.500
He looked exactly like a pentagram.

02:04:49.500 --> 02:04:51.500
I'll get it cause I'm a Satanist.

02:04:51.500 --> 02:04:53.500
Between Kurt Cobain and Gerard.

02:04:53.500 --> 02:04:54.500
It took me a while to figure this out,

02:04:54.500 --> 02:04:56.500
but she meant pentagram as in like cross,

02:04:56.500 --> 02:04:57.500
like a cross between,

02:04:57.500 --> 02:04:58.500
but she says pentagram instead.

02:04:58.500 --> 02:04:59.500
It's actually pretty clever.

02:05:00.500 --> 02:05:03.500
But then I looked at vampire and he looked so smexy too

02:05:03.500 --> 02:05:05.500
with his gothic black hair.

02:05:05.500 --> 02:05:08.500
I thought of the time when we screwed, wait,

02:05:09.500 --> 02:05:12.500
wait, she fucked vampire.

02:05:16.500 --> 02:05:19.500
And that's, wait, I thought they just kissed.

02:05:19.500 --> 02:05:21.500
Holy shit.

02:05:21.500 --> 02:05:23.500
She just straight up anyways.

02:05:23.500 --> 02:05:26.500
And the time I did it with Draco and Dumbledore came

02:05:26.500 --> 02:05:29.500
in the team where Draco almost,

02:05:29.500 --> 02:05:34.500
Suisse, Dald and vampire was so sportive.

02:05:34.500 --> 02:05:37.500
Snipe laughed angrily.

02:05:37.500 --> 02:05:40.500
He started to pray to Volzemort.

02:05:40.500 --> 02:05:43.500
He started to do an incapacitation dancing

02:05:43.500 --> 02:05:47.500
around the stokes whipping Draco and vampire.

02:05:47.500 --> 02:05:49.500
Suddenly a idea I had.

02:05:49.500 --> 02:05:54.500
I closed up my eyes and using my vampire powers.

02:05:54.500 --> 02:05:59.500
I sent a telepathetic mess massage to Draco and vampire

02:05:59.500 --> 02:06:02.500
so they would destruct Snape.

02:06:02.500 --> 02:06:04.500
Dumbledork will get you.

02:06:04.500 --> 02:06:05.500
I'm sorry.

02:06:05.500 --> 02:06:06.500
Dumbledork will get you.

02:06:06.500 --> 02:06:07.500
Draco's shooting.

02:06:07.500 --> 02:06:08.500
Yeah.

02:06:08.500 --> 02:06:11.500
Just wait until the mystery find out.

02:06:11.500 --> 02:06:13.500
Vampire yelled.

02:06:13.500 --> 02:06:16.500
Meanwhile, I took out my wand.

02:06:17.500 --> 02:06:20.500
You ridiculous dunderhead.

02:06:20.500 --> 02:06:22.500
I can't do the Snape voice right now.

02:06:22.500 --> 02:06:23.500
Snoop.

02:06:23.500 --> 02:06:25.500
You ridiculous dunderhead.

02:06:25.500 --> 02:06:27.500
I can't do a Snoop Dogg voice either.

02:06:28.500 --> 02:06:32.500
He took off Draco's clothes.

02:06:32.500 --> 02:06:35.500
Just as he was about to grape juice him.

02:06:35.500 --> 02:06:39.500
Crucio, I shitted, pointed my wound.

02:06:39.500 --> 02:06:42.500
Snoop scrimmed and started running around the room

02:06:42.500 --> 02:06:43.500
scrimming.

02:06:43.500 --> 02:06:45.500
Meanwhile, I grabbed my black mobile

02:06:45.500 --> 02:06:46.500
and sent a text to Sirius.

02:06:46.500 --> 02:06:48.500
I stopped doing Crucio.

02:06:48.500 --> 02:06:50.500
You dunderhead.

02:06:50.500 --> 02:06:51.500
I'm going to kill.

02:06:51.500 --> 02:06:54.500
Shooted Snape as then suddenly Severus came.

02:06:54.500 --> 02:06:57.500
Wait, but they're the same person.

02:07:02.500 --> 02:07:04.500
Snake put the whip behind his back.

02:07:04.500 --> 02:07:05.500
Oh, hello, Seth.

02:07:05.500 --> 02:07:07.500
I was just teaching them something.

02:07:07.500 --> 02:07:08.500
He lied.

02:07:08.500 --> 02:07:11.500
But suddenly Lucian and Professor Traveler came into

02:07:11.500 --> 02:07:14.500
room and Sirius unlocked the chains and put them

02:07:14.500 --> 02:07:15.500
around Snape.

02:07:15.500 --> 02:07:19.500
Then Professor Traveler said, hold on.

02:07:19.500 --> 02:07:21.500
Come on, Neboni.

02:07:21.500 --> 02:07:22.500
Let's go.

02:07:24.500 --> 02:07:27.500
And scene.

02:07:34.500 --> 02:07:35.500
How wonderful.

02:07:35.500 --> 02:07:37.500
Oh, I'm over here.

02:07:37.500 --> 02:07:39.500
Let me take my glasses off.

02:07:41.500 --> 02:07:43.500
Let me put those away.

02:07:43.500 --> 02:07:46.500
Let me flip myself back.

02:07:46.500 --> 02:07:49.500
Beeping, beeping, moow.

02:07:54.500 --> 02:07:57.500
Wait a second.

02:08:02.500 --> 02:08:04.500
Oh, yeah.

02:08:06.500 --> 02:08:08.500
All right.

keep it up for I just want to make sure like cuz I want people to be able to

02:14:55.740 --> 02:15:02.900
make it especially cuz it's a member stream and I don't want people to get

02:15:02.900 --> 02:15:06.740
like cuz it's usually funner like to do that sort of stream when you're there I

02:15:06.900 --> 02:15:14.100
don't have okay what games have I been playing I've been playing cult of the

02:15:14.100 --> 02:15:33.220
lamb sometimes I could probably beat that I could play Elden Ring but like again I

02:15:33.220 --> 02:15:42.140
wouldn't we're not gonna get far cuz I'm a slow gamer and I haven't played

02:15:42.140 --> 02:15:46.420
Elden Ring in like a year so I'm not gonna be good but I do want to play the

02:15:46.420 --> 02:16:10.460
DLC okay you like the adventuring part okay alright I just like cuz I like I

02:16:10.460 --> 02:16:18.860
literally just like wander for fucking hours but maybe cuz um you can have the

02:16:18.860 --> 02:16:22.420
hair and help but I don't want you guys to help like I don't I don't want my hand

02:16:22.420 --> 02:16:28.740
held for that I'll just have to think of a build beforehand and then remember how

02:16:28.740 --> 02:16:33.860
I get my runes before cuz I usually do a certain thing to get more runes off the

02:16:33.860 --> 02:16:41.420
bat like a level up faster um I'd never really to be honest I didn't really use

02:16:41.420 --> 02:16:50.420
spirit summons a lot except for mimic tier hardest soul's game DLC attempted by

02:16:50.420 --> 02:16:56.580
shivony darkness dementia bum Raven Way I don't do I have to play through the

02:16:56.580 --> 02:17:01.100
entire game and get an ending in order for me to play the DLC because again I

02:17:01.100 --> 02:17:10.940
beat Elden Ring on my PlayStation I didn't I only just got it for PC not as

02:17:10.940 --> 02:17:16.500
beat Moog okay okay okay so I yeah okay then I'll probably speedrun and beat

02:17:16.500 --> 02:17:32.580
Radon and Moog is such a fucking bitch to fight um to she bees to she bees okay

02:17:32.580 --> 02:17:36.900
what day would you guys like me to play Elden Ring what's a good game for

02:17:36.900 --> 02:17:38.900
everyone

02:17:42.900 --> 02:17:47.580
we're done oh we're done I can just cheese we're done that's not hard although I

02:17:47.580 --> 02:17:51.540
can cheese Moog too but

02:17:56.980 --> 02:18:01.740
my face when I spread misinformation

02:18:01.740 --> 02:18:17.260
I've got a free schedule all week you just want to you just want to Elden Ring

02:18:17.260 --> 02:18:23.420
fucking all week marathon I think you scheduling your days off first makes the

02:18:23.420 --> 02:18:25.780
most sense yeah but I don't really care about my days off because I just want to

02:18:25.780 --> 02:18:28.620
hang out with you guys about time

02:18:31.740 --> 02:18:37.220
sorry

02:18:38.220 --> 02:18:40.220
my little sister is

02:18:44.220 --> 02:18:50.140
people on the 4th oh that's right July 4th I forget holidays exist

02:18:50.300 --> 02:18:52.300
um

02:18:57.260 --> 02:19:01.100
I think I was invited by Salem to go over her house

02:19:01.100 --> 02:19:04.940
that's what we look cool that she has let me see

02:19:04.940 --> 02:19:06.940
Salem

02:19:14.620 --> 02:19:19.420
okay I'm sure she did all of can't make it because she's in the middle of her family

02:19:19.420 --> 02:19:22.860
I'm not really used to celebrating holidays I was brought up and I did

02:19:22.860 --> 02:19:26.140
celebrating holidays so I forget the holidays exist sometimes

02:19:26.140 --> 02:19:32.540
um so I'll do

02:19:33.420 --> 02:19:39.820
I'll do Elden Ring okay it looks like Azura has a membership stream at 4 p.m. on

02:19:39.820 --> 02:19:43.420
Wednesday so I'll do Elden Ring on Wednesday after her at

02:19:43.420 --> 02:19:47.740
6 p.m. and I'll probably just like play until

02:19:47.820 --> 02:19:51.660
oh wait no or she's not even streaming well okay well we'll just do an Elden Ring

02:19:51.660 --> 02:19:55.580
run she be

02:19:56.060 --> 02:19:59.580
Elden Ring

02:20:17.900 --> 02:20:24.780
let's do it okay just play cool cool cool and then okay I'll guess so I'll

02:20:24.780 --> 02:20:28.940
probably I might do a gorilla on the 4th before I

02:20:28.940 --> 02:20:34.220
go maybe just like a zatsu um

02:20:34.220 --> 02:20:36.860
in the morning

02:20:37.340 --> 02:20:39.980
face is itchy

02:20:40.620 --> 02:20:44.060
I'm like breaking out I think it's because of the fucking heat and the sweat

02:20:44.060 --> 02:20:47.660
and I feel so fucking gross and you get some like those acne dot things

02:20:47.980 --> 02:20:52.460
more mad at me I have time yeah I'll probably in the morning

02:20:53.420 --> 02:20:56.060
one time

02:20:59.340 --> 02:21:04.060
I'll do like 11 a.m. or 10 a.m. I don't know

02:21:06.860 --> 02:21:11.100
not sleepy sleepy ass

02:21:11.100 --> 02:21:16.540
I don't think I see fitter schedule so she's probably gonna stream at 12

02:21:18.380 --> 02:21:23.340
the damn girl is beat yeah I won't add it to my schedule but Thursday I'll

02:21:23.340 --> 02:21:26.700
probably stream in the morning and do like a zatsu

02:21:26.700 --> 02:21:31.660
um but I don't want to hold myself to it if like Salem needs help getting

02:21:31.660 --> 02:21:37.340
stuff done because I also have to talk to Salem with a podcast we might be

02:21:37.340 --> 02:21:41.100
starting and I have to get her all vtuber shit I I'm turning my friend into a

02:21:41.100 --> 02:21:45.180
vtuber I hope you guys are happy um why can't I

02:21:45.180 --> 02:21:51.740
move to the side okay Friday no yes

02:21:53.020 --> 02:21:57.180
what games have I been playing I haven't played vampire the masquerade but

02:21:57.180 --> 02:22:00.860
vampire the masquerade keeps getting fucking claimed

02:22:00.860 --> 02:22:04.620
so I might not play that which sucks because it's it's like the music in

02:22:04.620 --> 02:22:09.100
there is copyrighted for some fucking reason

02:22:09.180 --> 02:22:11.500
this is me on

02:22:16.860 --> 02:22:19.580
why do I have a pitch for because it's going up your ass

02:22:19.580 --> 02:22:27.180
um what do you classify as morning uh I classify 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. is morning

02:22:27.180 --> 02:22:30.860
or like 11 a.m. is like early afternoon

02:22:31.660 --> 02:22:36.860
forced vtuber vacation it's just awesome because like I told strongy this idea

02:22:36.940 --> 02:22:41.260
and like no me and me and Salem have had this idea for a very very long time

02:22:41.260 --> 02:22:45.100
um since we started becoming friends for several years

02:22:45.100 --> 02:22:49.980
and then I get to live out this cool podcasting dream idea and then get to

02:22:49.980 --> 02:22:52.860
invite other girls that like smutty books because it's going to be a

02:22:52.860 --> 02:22:56.300
smutty book podcast but I have it's going to take such a long I might take

02:22:56.300 --> 02:23:00.300

02:30:14.700 --> 02:30:17.260
about

02:30:37.260 --> 02:30:42.940
actually no because she's I'm gonna I'm gonna do that one a little bit later because that's

02:30:42.940 --> 02:30:46.780
a membership stream and I don't like overlapping with membership streams I don't want to force people

02:30:46.780 --> 02:30:48.140
to choose I don't like that

02:30:52.940 --> 02:30:57.500
the fair because she overlaps everyone you're not wrong mercy's the only one that doesn't get

02:30:57.500 --> 02:31:01.100
overlapped but sometimes she does and it's hilarious to me

02:31:04.300 --> 02:31:08.540
she's already streams 12 hours every day it's more than a full-time job she's doing overtime

02:31:09.260 --> 02:31:15.340
consider it mad up yeah I try not I don't like overlapping but I end up doing it myself because

02:31:15.340 --> 02:31:18.620
we are just the overlap corpo because we just love hanging out with our fan bases

02:31:19.660 --> 02:31:26.060
okay then so did I give myself sunday off I don't know

02:31:27.820 --> 02:31:32.460
again I might like a lot of like the days off I can't see me I'm doing air quotes but the days

02:31:32.460 --> 02:31:38.540
off like I'll usually just do a unless I have like some pressing errands to do I'll usually just

02:31:39.340 --> 02:31:46.140
do a um a gorilla stream a gorilla stream

02:31:49.740 --> 02:31:53.420
I do feel like there's quite a distinction between fan bases like not that many watch all

02:31:53.420 --> 02:32:00.380
oh I would have to disagree with you I um I have to disagree because I feel like

02:32:00.380 --> 02:32:05.580
yes there's there's definitely like fans that are like die hard like oh my god they're my oh

02:32:05.580 --> 02:32:09.980
gee but then I think there's people that are like you know I don't mind watching scrawny and then

02:32:09.980 --> 02:32:16.300
she be and then I see and then you know get cozy with the zura and then blah blah blah you know

02:32:18.460 --> 02:32:24.220
so I I have to disagree with up I have to disagree all right I think that's good

02:32:26.060 --> 02:32:29.740
probably we'll do a girl in the morning on Thursday and probably we'll do a girl on sunday

02:32:29.740 --> 02:32:35.180
but who knows maybe I won't feel like it maybe I'll be dying my body has been hurting me lightly

02:32:36.140 --> 02:32:38.620
I've got a five bro flare up and I don't know why

02:32:42.780 --> 02:32:49.420

I see streams at the worst time for me to watch river yeah and then like it's sad because like

02:33:07.980 --> 02:33:11.100
