00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,980
setting up beforehand and I was adding the chat I was so confused because I'm

28
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:36,420
like why are people saying that straw knee rated I'm like oh maybe it's it's

29
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:41,780
grabbing stuff from a past tree but then they come into the chat you guys are

30
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:48,720
all here two hours I don't blame her I normally stream at four and she must

31
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,040
have been really tired cuz usually she'll message me and be like hey what

32
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:56,440
you doing so she must have been like knocked out

33
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:05,560
replaying continued puppy ring oh it's nice to see everybody yeah normally I

34
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:11,840
stream at four but I had some stuff to take care of beforehand grab more stuff

35
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:19,680
for Fia do some recording so busy busy and then sometimes I just like to move

36
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,120
around my schedule so it gives more time to relax and like clean my house and

37
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:30,960
vice versa cuz my house is an absolute mess right now still yeah I missed you

38
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:38,800
guys too I missed just playing games with you guys I was like gonna say I'm a

39
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,160
little low energy today as you can probably hear in my voice but I'm okay

40
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:48,480
I'm just low energy it's just been very tired I need to fix my sleep schedule

41
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:55,320
but don't worry I have some a gamer sops youth coach she be so I'll be ready to

42
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:02,760
rumble a little bit how was my day yesterday very very long I had a lot of

43
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:14,560
blood drawn at my doctor's appointment and my arm hurts so yeah you like the

44
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,840
voice message I'm glad I haven't so I normally don't listen to the finished

45
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:23,240
product but I listened to a part of it and I was like oh this sounds kind of

46
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:32,120
nice to be become talk to you she said she has some questions I did speak to my

47
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,360
sister she seemed a little flustered after the last stream she had with you

48
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:45,400
guys so yeah yes I am tan hello if you don't know me hi my name is she be caught

49
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:55,720
in bum and I am the girl failure Dom or I try to be indulge Gen 1 indulge from

50
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:02,120
the alert and I like to yap a lot I like to try on different outfits I like to

51
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:07,760
role play I like to voice act and I hope that you'll stay here a while yes

52
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:15,600
caught and bum I am she be caught in bum now I am tan as I mentioned on my

53
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:22,240
stream on my stream my Twitter I will be predominantly going forward using my

54
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:31,480
tan toggle not saying that flesh and blood she be will not be around but I

55
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,040
just prefer I think actually the model looks good with a little tan to be

56
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:44,880
honest with you so I think it's nice if it's the kind of Giardu aesthetic my

57
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:57,040
eyes let me give my little ooo mouth on yeah let's flash pay but I don't know but

58
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:05,480
it will take time to like change a lot of my stuff so I don't really like it'll

59
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:10,400
take I know like a year for that branding to stick so I'm not really a

60
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:15,680
verse to people drawing me pale pale skinned it doesn't really matter I am

61
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:24,080
very pale right now because I have not gone outside and I don't I honestly I

62
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:32,280
don't care either way but I want to predominantly stream as tan I know some

63
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:43,620
people might be a little bothered by that but I will I so a lot of people

64
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:49,200
wonder if I had input in the design before I started that I was too scared

65
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:58,760
to be tan that's not the case realistically it's very rare to see a

66
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:05,480
tan Corpo or agency vtuber the only other one I can think of besides Azera is

67
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:10,360
Serena although I know that there are more coming to the kind of the limelight

68
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:16,080
I've seen I think like two others pop up which I think is really cool but I had

69
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:24,680
no input I always I auditioned to an agency knowing I would probably be cast

70
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,280
like 99% sure be cast as someone who is pale or skinned and that never really

71
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:40,040
bothered me at all I am playing you know my the character and stuff and I

72
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:45,280
wasn't I probably just would have done handcams a lot less because people

73
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:50,800
sometimes like to speculate and such but I'm strong immediately when I was

74
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,800
hired was kind enough to say I'm so sorry I whitewashed you we're going to fix

75
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:05,800
this the summer bun is a beauty as thank you pookie but I it just made more sense

76
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:10,520
for me to be tan for immersion reasons and we're so early on we're set we're

77
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:15,640
only three months in so I think it's okay and most of you already knew that I

78
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:25,680
was tan anyways but yeah and sauna like sauna was such a pivotal person within

79
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:31,480
the hollow community it was a shame to see her go I wish someone like her was

80
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:37,080
still around but I appreciate you guys for being very understanding of the

81
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:47,080
change I will say first and foremost I will not I am a vtuber this is not like

82
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:53,200
some sort of political statement I just want to be myself because I find

83
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,440
myself growing closer and being one with she be every day at first I kind of went

84
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,480
into it like I'm going to play a character but I realize she's more

85
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:06,800
closer to me than I think I am she be and she beat is me

86
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:18,520
yeah the guy out and like that's it's interesting cuz tan really does fly

87
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:26,440
when it's guy out but you know yeah it's we're just hanging out but don't let

88
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:36,520
that distract you from my streams I also want to I feel like I haven't been

89
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:46,760
myself lately in terms of I've been pandering to a more how do you say

90
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:53,240
edgy or a crowd and that was not my intention I realize some people within

91
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:58,480
the community have taken jokes that I've said a little bit personally especially

92
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,200
when it comes to my skin tone and I never want anybody to be uncomfortable I do

93
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,820
make a joke here and there like because I'm black I can say that because I'm

94
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:16,400
black but I realize I don't really like what that perpetuates but I'm just

95
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:21,840
going to try to be a little bit more professional yes I have a lot of freedom

96
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:29,240
being an agency for being an agency vtuber however I feel like I have taken

97
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:41,120
that and have been a little bit I don't know I just feel like I've been kind of

98
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:47,400
someone that I'm not and I'm very I want to be an approachable and inviting

99
00:15:47,400 --> 00:16:02,640
person I want people to yes I'm a Dom but I'm not you know a total bitch yeah I

100
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:07,040
just wanted to let you guys know that I will be because I you know I'm always

101
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:15,680
transparent and reflective with you so I just wanted to be honest that I will

102
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:21,640
stop making jokes like that and don't don't don't get it twisted this is not

103
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:28,320
like oh management told her to be like this oh people like oh no no nobody

104
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:35,600
told me to do anything I am my own woman I made this choice based off of realizing

105
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,240
I'm not an agency I'm not an indie vtuber I can't just say anything I am part of a

106
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,320
brand I'm part of a company and I want what's best for my gen mates and I will

107
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:56,200
put nothing of them in harm's way but yes yes I will just be me whatever

108
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:02,360
goats your float that's the thing I suppose but yeah so we're just gonna

109
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:08,640
have fun I'm also going to try to work a little bit harder at playing the Dom not

110
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,000
playing the Dom character because I'm one I'm realizing how much it is kind of

111
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:19,840
how I am I am I am a dominant woman if that makes any sense not in only like the

112
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:26,800
sexual sense but only like I see myself as I can be very motherly or older

113
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:37,840
sisterly and I want to be the best person for you all I just like I have my whip

114
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:43,480
out somewhere I forget where it went my whip is somewhere I like walk by it when

115
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:54,600
I was cleaning earlier and I was like why is this out yeah the ghiati Riz yeah I

116
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:59,280
also added a little I like the little mole I feel like I can't be a milfin only

117
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:05,640
have one mole but don't worry like I'm not like dramatically changing like my

118
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:11,320
design by the way guys like don't fear I don't think at like adding tan it

119
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:16,400
doesn't isn't that dramatic if I'm like actually I'm a cat girl now and I'm

120
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:22,280
going to be cute and funny and blah blah blah blah and I'm actually going to be a

121
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:28,200
sub blah blah then yes I would totally be pissed this is not what I signed up for

122
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:34,040
but no I'm not doing that of people are like are she rebranding as a nun I am

123
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:40,600
not that was just for fun role play there will be a nun in a future gen gen 4 you

124
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:51,120
heard it here first folks I'm telling you all the tea but yeah I thought it was

125
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:56,440
I'm very pleased that you guys liked the role play I think YouTube did too to be

126
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:02,480
honest with you because they at first I was limited but then I was I turned

127
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:12,200
green and I was like a man of God has reviewed this stream and they see that

128
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:17,720
it's as fit to be monetized not that it even matters I only get like ten dollars

129
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:28,600
whatever I can't be TV will also be yeah I will also be a part of gen 4 I am

130
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:36,360
leaving the first gen and coming back to that to the gen 4 I will graduate that

131
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,640
will come back you won't know it's me I have to ask since I'm a guy what are my

132
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:49,120
chances of becoming an agency Vtuber not really the stream for me to answer that

133
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:56,160
but I'll go ahead and answer this anyways very slim and I'll say that with

134
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:01,240
utmost honesty and transparency to you it's very difficult to become a male

135
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:07,040
agency Vtuber unless you join like hollow stars or like Nijisanji and that is very

136
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:11,560
competitive so good luck with that but I am not a dude I can't really speak on

137
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:17,240
that so I would ask male Vtubers as I am not male as you can tell by my

138
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:26,160
behunguzungus actually I think my I turned my physics down because of when I

139
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:31,160
put on like a booth outfit I have to turn my physics down there we go now you

140
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:36,200
guys can see me move a lot more and my mouth is an S stiff

141
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:46,000
she really bouncing a physique for the seven yeah that'll be me I'll be the

142
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,320
deep I it's so funny to me because I keep like the deep was in gossip girl and

143
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:56,480

strani said the reeflings of the dad I've done one and two but strani also gave

203
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:17,000
birth to us so it's a little bit of a mess well I well strani can be like a cat

204
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:24,640
or a snake and have multiple fathers for multiple children did you know that

205
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:29,960
did you know that snakes and cats can do that I forget what else it's like a

206
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:36,760
it's like a it's an evolutionary thing where like a snake can retain the the

207
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:49,000
ink of a of a former suitor and ink themselves

208
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:57,200

209
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:05,720
without it look at her stick you Charlie for the five super so what I'm hearing is

210
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:10,480
that she was gonna steal strani away from us no no no it'll only be for your

211
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:21,440
amusement this is a group activity they're printers now I guess and yeah

212
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:28,520
cats cats have it like a cat can dance with multiple partners and then all the

213
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:34,040
kids can have multiple like it's very interesting because they remember like

214
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:42,160
cats are individual in their own little sack so I am yep that's true I I speak

215

483
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:16,800
probably been around for centuries my time is different for gods hello hey skelly you look like

484
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:20,480
you know your way around Tartarus found some of this ancient titan blood out there and I was looking

485
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:27,680
to score some more notice the icon on the left you can change it to another buff what do you mean

486
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:31,920
on the mirror I've come to the right place regarding that there pal it's your mean weapons back there

487
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,840
can find the stuff once you get all the way through Tartarus with one that's all the blood

488
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:41,200
you're gonna get for the time being anyhow what a time being how am I wondering what the accent is

489
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:48,720
I don't know there's always the invention of writing stuff down you'll figure something out

490
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:52,800
get absolutely just wrecked okay what are you talking about

491
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,520
what do you be the bottom quarter

492
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,320

493
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:16,720
I don't know the left

what the heck

496
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:52,720
I wasn't looking at those icons

497
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:06,880
maybe like so why would I

498
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:12,080
oh one time per chamber

499
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,240
so I could die in a chamber and just get it back

500
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:33,280
yeah they need a more like they need like exclamation points on those things

501
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:40,800
you think death deviance is definitely better than stubborn I don't know if this is per chamber

502
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:43,680
it's only 20% less

503
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:19,200
oh so I don't have to pick it up I can just it just takes five seconds to come back to me I would

504
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:20,000
actually prefer that

505
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:31,840
yeah yeah fascinating fascinating

506
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:41,520
yeah but I don't know if I'm gonna run into any boss oh I don't know if this run I felt just like

507
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:42,880
sprint towards whomever

508
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:48,960
yeah that's true bosses will kill you twice that's a good point that's a good point

509
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:56,000
all right I think I'll stick with that and we'll see I got a toot

510
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:00,000
can't tell if I have to pee

511
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:14,000
I think I got a pee I'll be right back

512
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:32,000

513
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:22,000

514
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,840

only for six encounters though

601
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:30,480
one time benefit i'm kind of tempted to do this

602
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:34,080
because i just feel like this is not like

603
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:41,520

606
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:52,240

613
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:49,200
However...

614
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:55,200

You wouldn't hurt a pretty boy like me.

628
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:58,200
I'm too pretty to be hurt with my weak...

629

630
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:04,200

I don't really care about that.

635
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:19,200
For the trove trial.

636
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:23,200
Yeah, okay.

637
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:27,200
She's a boy. What do you mean?

638
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:32,200
I like how I pressed the wrong button.

639
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:45,200
Oh, it's going to break, I'm telling you.

640
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:55,200
Oh.

641
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:58,200
Okay, this definitely doesn't do what I wanted.

642
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:00,200
It's not, it's like very delayed.

643
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:05,200
Why'd she spawn right behind me, bro?

644
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:06,200
That's not nice.

645
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:08,200
Get sniped, get sniped.

646
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:12,200
What else is here?

647
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:16,200
How am I not done yet?

648
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:20,200
There we go.

649
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:25,200
Let's go chat with Dionysus.

650
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:29,200
Kami Brochie.

651
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:30,200
I am the best Brochie.

652
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:31,200
Shabros-

653
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:33,200
Shabroski in the chat.

654
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:36,200
Got scared by an egg.

655
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:37,200
I'm chucking.

656
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:39,200
I'm throwing.

657
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:42,200
Literally, I'm just throwing this game.

658
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:46,200
How'd that not kill it?

659
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:51,200
Jams.

660
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:57,200
Shoot your little lasers at me.

661
01:20:58,200 --> 01:20:59,200
My eye is itchy.

662
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:02,200
What I like about this game is that I can just press buttons

663
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:04,200
and I don't have to worry about like,

664
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:06,200
oh, I have to move in this, or that direction.

665
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:08,200
Who is throwing these?

666
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:09,200
Is it you?

667
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:10,200
You little bitch.

668
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:12,200
How are you not dead?

669
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:17,200
Oh, I should probably get out of the way.

670
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:23,200
Get out of the way, Dionysus.

671
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:24,200
How is this locked?

672
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:27,200
I don't have enough money.

673
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:31,200
Oh, this is not Dionysus.

674
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:32,200
I'm so stupid.

675
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:45,200
I haven't even been using my cast.

676
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:49,200
Because I would prefer to have something.

677
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:52,200
Because I've been spamming my-

678
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:53,200
Powered up.

679
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:54,200
That one and I might as well do this.

680
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:55,200
Ow.

681
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:06,200
Sold.

682
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:07,200
For the highest bidder.

683
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:13,200
Sorry about that.

684
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:15,200
Sorry I'm looking around.

685
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:21,200
But I haven't been using my cast.

686
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:38,200
Oh my god.

687
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:40,200
Well, they have that choke point.

688
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:42,200
I don't know what to do about that.

689
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:48,200
I can't run through that.

690
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:51,200
I don't even know if I can dash through that.

691
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:53,200
Oh my god.

692
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:57,200
Jeez.

693
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,200
I'd rather get that.

694
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:02,200
Okay.

695
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:05,200
I don't know what to do about that.

696
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:07,200
I'd rather get that.

697
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:09,200
Okay.

698
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:11,200
Can I please get some nice boons?

699
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:15,200
It really wants me to upgrade my cast.

700
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:19,200
It'll come in handy when I actually get a boon for it.

701
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:22,200
Oh, I forgot that you did.

702
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:23,200
Thank you.

703
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:25,200
I thought you would be...

704
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:27,200
I don't know what to do about that.

705
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:29,200
I don't know what to do about that.

706
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:36,200
I don't want a different dash.

707
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:37,200
Oh my god.

708
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:38,200
Why is there something in here?

709
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:40,200
Ow.

710
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:41,200
I hate this so much.

711
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:43,200
You're like, I hate this game.

712
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:50,200
Right there.

713
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:52,200
I don't like the way she do it.

714
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:53,200
Right there.

715
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:59,200
They just really don't want me to run to any gods besides the ones that do buffs for things that I just...

716
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:01,200
Oh.

717
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:03,200
Okay.

718
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:13,200
Alright, I'll start using my freaking cast.

719
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:15,200
Yeah, yeah, I think because of the...

720
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:24,200
What the heck?

721
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:30,200
I love you so much.

722
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:31,200
You are so hot.

723
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:35,200
I love your voice.

724
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:36,200
Oh my...

725
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:38,200
I wish I talked like that naturally.

726
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:45,200
The result wasn't like...

727
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:46,200
You were like...

728
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:49,200
It's not a matter of want.

729
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:51,200
The way out is there, in that direction.

730
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:53,200
You're more stubborn than your father.

731
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:02,200
I already got my justified thing.

732
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:04,200
I just kind of want you to kill me again.

733
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:10,200
I'm pervious.

734
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:14,200
Aren't you?

735
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:15,200
I'm stuck.

736
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:17,200
I'm stuck on pause.

737
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:22,200
You're dumb.

738
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:25,200
Oh, I thought I might...

739
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:26,200
Okay.

740
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:27,200
Oh, I forgot.

741
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:30,200
I have another death defy because I was lucky too.

742
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:39,200
You're numb?

743
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:41,200
I need to back up now.

744
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:42,200
Back up?

745
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:43,200
Okay.

746
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:09,200
Help.

747
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:10,200
You are...

748
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:12,200
I already got my first tier.

749
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:23,200
I'm stuck.

750
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:27,200
Oh, I'm freaking out.

751
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:28,200
I hate those.

752
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:42,200
All right.

753
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:49,200
How did this take me so many tries?

754
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:51,200
My first run.

755
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:52,200
Does she weaken?

756
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:54,200
Does she weaken?

757
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:57,200
After you get to Asphodel?

758
01:26:57,200 --> 01:26:59,200
Because like, what the hell was that?

759
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:02,200
What the hell was that?

760
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:07,200
I haven't touched this game in like two weeks!

761
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:14,200
Oh, my dash put weaken on her.

762
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:16,200
Oh, I guess that was helpful.

763
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:20,200
God damn.

764
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:26,200
She got shy.

765
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:31,200
You're going nowhere, boy.

766
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:33,200
Dad, you're making my screen red.

767
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:39,200
Okay, so that allows me to...

768
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:42,200
...

769
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:44,200
Worth it.

770
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:49,200
You can sell some.

771
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:51,200
I'm good, actually, on that.

772
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:52,200
Uh, all right.

773
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:02,200
Yeah!

774
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:07,200
I don't know how I beat the Dancing Lion so fast.

775
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:08,200
Thank you, Mimic Tier.

776
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:14,200
Did he get stronger points but into the Darkness Mirror bathrooms?

777
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:15,200
Okay.

778
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:23,200
Oh, I can change it since I used my Death Default.

779
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:24,200
That's a good point.

780
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:25,200
That's a good point.

781
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:30,200
I'm like, can I like take it off and put it back on?

782
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:41,200
Okay.

783
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:56,200
I might just take a black shawl for now.

784
01:28:57,200 --> 01:29:00,200
I was thinking about that.

785
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:04,200
I usually run into stuff.

786
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:12,200
Switch to Tooth After Meg.

787
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:13,200
That's a good point.

788
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:14,200
That's a good point.

789
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:20,200
Yeah, I'm thinking.

790
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:21,200
I'm thinking.

791
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:22,200
Hold on.

792
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:23,200
Oh.

793
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:26,200
Did I click the right one?

794
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:28,200
Okay, I did.

795
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:29,200
I thought I accidentally selected something else.

796
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:31,200
I was supposed to be like, wait, what?

797
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:37,200
Okay.

798
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:38,200
Lovely.

799
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:41,200
Okay.

800
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:52,200
May all wins be baddie in your deaths, few.

801
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:53,200
Thank you.

802
01:29:56,200 --> 01:30:00,200
I feel like someone should be here, like to talk to you for some reason.

803
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:03,200
Oh, I get coins, my first thing.

804
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:04,200
That's stupid.

805
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:07,200
Stupid in it.

806
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:09,200
Hello.

807
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:12,200
Oh.

808
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:15,200
Come on, dances.

809
01:30:29,200 --> 01:30:30,200
I'm trying to like weaken them.

810
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:31,200
It's hard now.

811
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:36,200
I'm using my cast.

812
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:39,200
Oh, what the?

813
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:41,200
Interesting.

814
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:46,200
Welcome.

815
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:50,200
I look at the other guys over there.

816
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:13,200
Hi, you fool.

817
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:16,200
Oh my God.

818
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:18,200
I need a stronger main attack.

819
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:20,200
Nice.

820
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:24,200
Hermes.

821
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:26,200
Interesante.

822
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:30,200
Oh, or I can get health.

823
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:32,200
You know, I'm actually going to go to Hermes.

824
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:38,200
It's palms for my special.

825
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:40,200
I think maybe the souls game did make me better.

826
01:31:48,200 --> 01:31:51,200
I like, it's funny because I like range stuff.

827
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:54,200
Ow, ow.

828
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:02,200
But it's like, if I play a soul book, book, book, book, book,

829
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:03,200
if I play a soul's like,

830
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:05,200
damn, damn.

831
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:07,200
It's Hermes.

832
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:11,200
Um, I'll give something.

833
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:12,200
Did I already gift Hermes?

834
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:14,200
I don't think I did.

835
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:17,200
Lord Hermes, please accept this gift as a...

836
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:19,200
Hello, Hermes.

837
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:21,200
I'm mighty keen of you to be the tip there, boss.

838
01:32:21,200 --> 01:32:22,200
And I have a tip for you.

839
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:24,200
Don't be slow.

840
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:25,200
Don't be slow.

841
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:29,200
New cast is going to be your damage to the target.

842
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:31,200
I don't know.

843
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:32,200
You think I pay attention?

844
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:36,200
I leveled up my reaction time.

845
01:32:37,200 --> 01:32:39,200
Yes, the Hermes is very lovely.

846
01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:46,200
I like how it's...

847
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:49,200
The chat just really eases.

848
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:50,200
I don't know why it eases.

849
01:32:54,200 --> 01:32:55,200
Can I open it?

850
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:01,200
Because it's, it's like a little widget thing you can use.

851
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:05,200
YouTube chat overload.

852
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:07,200
It's like pages.

853
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:14,200
I got a tube.

854
01:33:19,200 --> 01:33:20,200
Did that mute?

855
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:21,200
I don't think it did.

856
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:30,200
I don't think so.

857
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:32,200
Because I saw my...

858
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:34,200
The base covered it?

859
01:33:35,200 --> 01:33:36,200
Good.

860
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:39,200
Because I, I pressed the mute...

861
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:46,200
The base goes hard, it does.

862
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:49,200
But, uh, I realize...

863
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:51,200
It looks like it, like, like it...

864
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:54,200
The green bar from, like, my mic goes down,

865
01:33:54,200 --> 01:33:57,200
but I'm like, does that mean I'm still unmuted?

866
01:33:58,200 --> 01:33:59,200
Wait, wait.

867
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:00,200
Okay.

868
01:34:00,200 --> 01:34:01,200
Can you guys hear me when I do this?

869
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:06,200
Did you hear what I said?

870
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:08,200
Did you hear?

871
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:10,200
You hear what I said?

872
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:11,200
No?

873
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:12,200
Okay.

874
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:13,200
So you got, yeah, you guys, okay.

875
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:17,200
I just said hi, don't worry about it.

876
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:21,200
Okay.

877
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:24,200
Thank you.

878
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:25,200
Oh, you gave me one health.

879
01:34:26,200 --> 01:34:27,200
Lambient plume.

880
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:34,200
What's going on there, cause?

881
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:35,200
Not like, cause.

882
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:36,200
Like, cause.

883
01:34:37,200 --> 01:34:38,200
You talk fast.

884
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:39,200
My God.

885
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:42,200
Chance of dodge.

886
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:45,200
I can dash more.

887
01:34:49,200 --> 01:34:51,200
I don't know if I should get greater evasion or...

888
01:34:52,200 --> 01:34:53,200
I haven't been using my cast too much.

889
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:55,200
It hasn't really been a focus.

890
01:34:55,200 --> 01:34:57,200
But I've been needing to dash more.

891
01:34:57,200 --> 01:35:00,200
I think I might do the dash.

892
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:05,200
Yeah.

893
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:07,200
Especially because I'm over here.

894
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:09,200
Prophecy foretold.

895
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:10,200
What else could I choose from?

896
01:35:11,200 --> 01:35:12,200
Oh!

897
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:14,200
A little double boonage.

898
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:17,200
A little double boonage.

899
01:35:17,200 --> 01:35:18,200
I can do that.

900
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:20,200
A little double boonage.

901
01:35:20,200 --> 01:35:22,200
I can do some double boonage.

902
01:35:25,200 --> 01:35:27,200
You want the game volume back up?

903
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:28,200
Hold on.

904
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:31,200
Oh.

905
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:38,200
Heller.

906
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:42,200
Oh!

907
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:43,200
Oh!

908
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:47,200
Why won't they be...

909
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:48,200
Well, I'm going with effort ID.

910
01:35:58,200 --> 01:36:00,200
I'm gonna get that, cause I want to be straight.

911
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:04,200
Listen!

912
01:36:05,200 --> 01:36:07,200
I thought it was gonna be the both of you.

913
01:36:08,200 --> 01:36:10,200
Forgive me, Lady Artemis.

914
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:12,200
Listen.

915
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:13,200
I didn't know that she was like that.

916
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:15,200
Oh, I'm happy I got this.

917
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:16,200
The dash.

918
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:17,200
What the hell?

919
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:18,200
Oh my god!

920
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:19,200
Oh my god!

921
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:20,200
What the...

922
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:21,200
What is happening?

923
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:25,200
Oh god.

924
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:26,200
Oh god.

925
01:36:26,200 --> 01:36:27,200
Oh my.

926
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:29,200
I'm very happy I got the dash.

927
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:31,200
Oh.

928
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:34,200
Hello.

929
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:35,200
Oh!

930
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:40,200
You make me mad.

931
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:42,200
I'll hunt you like a stag.

932
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:44,200
You heard of those.

933
01:36:44,200 --> 01:36:45,200
Did she?

934
01:36:48,200 --> 01:36:49,200
What?

935
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:54,200
Damn!

936
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:58,200
Artemis just rocked me cause I need a picker.

937
01:36:58,200 --> 01:36:59,200
Hey, Hypnos.

938
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:02,200
That's a good one.

939
01:37:02,200 --> 01:37:04,200
You know I can't let you enter your death.

940
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:05,200
Oh, it's my dad's chambers?

941
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:06,200
Nothing from you back there anyway.

942
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:07,200
It's a full attempt.

943
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:10,200
Hi puppy.

944
01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:11,200
Hi puppy.

945
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:13,200
You don't like it when I pet your other heads, huh?

946
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:14,200
No.

947
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:20,200
That's exactly how boomy is.

948
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:22,200
He just like does the same exact thing.

949
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:25,200
I can talk to my dog.

950
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:27,200
Hey boy, just me again.

951
01:37:27,200 --> 01:37:29,200
Need to report it's pretty dangerous out there.

952
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:31,200
Even without you on guard duty all the time.

953
01:37:32,200 --> 01:37:34,200
Are you just telling him he's not doing a good job?

954
01:37:34,200 --> 01:37:39,200
The sound of hell bear late knowledge is the softly spoken princess platitude.

955
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:42,200
Knowing full well the underworld is not as vision.

956
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:46,200
He calls all yonderes.

957
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:50,200
Giving nectar to Hypnos.

958
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:52,200
Maybe that's why they make him an ass.

959
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:53,200
Hello.

960
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:58,200
Because I never want to give him a nectar.

961
01:37:58,200 --> 01:37:59,200
You're back.

962
01:37:59,200 --> 01:38:00,200
Oh, hey.

963
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:01,200
Achilles, sir.

964
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:03,200
I got a relic of some sort out there.

965
01:38:03,200 --> 01:38:07,200
A club you will have ancient blood which formed after I fought with Megara.

966
01:38:07,200 --> 01:38:09,200
Is this really the Titan's blood I found?

967
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:10,200
Yeah, that's really weird.

968
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:11,200
As far as I know.

969
01:38:11,200 --> 01:38:12,200
Yes, lad.

970
01:38:12,200 --> 01:38:13,200
That it is.

971
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:15,200
Though who's exactly I'm not so sure.

972
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:17,200
You best hang on to it.

973
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:18,200
Interesting.

974
01:38:18,200 --> 01:38:19,200
I wasn't about to drink it.

975
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:20,200
Why can't I drink it?

976
01:38:20,200 --> 01:38:22,200
I want to drink the Titan's blood.

977
01:38:22,200 --> 01:38:25,200
Oh, that's so sparkly when I run around.

978
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:28,200
Are my feet on?

979
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:30,200
I haven't noticed that my feet are on fire.

980
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:32,200
Was that always a thing?

981
01:38:32,200 --> 01:38:34,200
Was my feet always on fire?

982
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:39,200
Achilles is now the employee of the month.

983
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:41,200
Oh, my sweet Dusa.

984
01:38:47,200 --> 01:38:48,200
Come back, Dusa.

985
01:38:48,200 --> 01:38:51,200
I want to romance you, Dusa.

986
01:38:51,200 --> 01:38:52,200
Please.

987
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:53,200
Please.

988
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:02,200
I got my burning feet from my paw.

989
01:39:02,200 --> 01:39:04,200
Looks like I'm just wearing socks that are on fire.

990
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:11,200
Okay, that's Max.

991
01:39:11,200 --> 01:39:12,200
I just want to see.

992
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:19,200
Okay, I kind of had it.

993
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:24,200
Dang.

994
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:31,200
How much is it if I get 500?

995
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:46,200
What do I spend my money on?

996
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:48,200
500 plus it's a 2?

997
01:39:48,200 --> 01:39:51,200
Oh, I...

998
01:39:53,200 --> 01:39:55,200
Had a head.

999
01:39:59,200 --> 01:40:03,200
I think I might get dark regeneration.

1000
01:40:04,200 --> 01:40:06,200
Firey presence.

1001
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:10,200
Firey presence.

1002
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:11,200
Firey presence.

1003
01:40:16,200 --> 01:40:18,200
Can I unlock this?

1004
01:40:18,200 --> 01:40:20,200
How many keys do I got?

1005
01:40:22,200 --> 01:40:23,200
I live two.

1006
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:25,200
I thought I had like four with the house.

1007
01:40:28,200 --> 01:40:29,200
Yeah, yeah.

1008
01:40:29,200 --> 01:40:32,200
You're telling me things I've like definitely known for a while.

1009
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:39,200
I was like stuck behind there for a second.

1010
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:42,200
I'm going to try to do it without the tooth.

1011
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:47,200
Yeah, let's try it.

1012
01:40:53,200 --> 01:40:56,200
Please give me someone good.

1013
01:40:56,200 --> 01:40:58,200
That's fine.

1014
01:40:59,200 --> 01:41:01,200
I always prefer Poseidon.

1015
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:05,200
Yes, I love Maratha.

1016
01:41:05,200 --> 01:41:07,200
What do you have for me?

1017
01:41:11,200 --> 01:41:13,200
Chain lightning.

1018
01:41:16,200 --> 01:41:18,200
I like chain lightning.

1019
01:41:18,200 --> 01:41:19,200
I'm going to do the electric shot.

1020
01:41:19,200 --> 01:41:20,200
All right, no tooths.

1021
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:21,200
Yeah.

1022
01:41:22,200 --> 01:41:24,200
Doesn't that change it?

1023
01:41:24,200 --> 01:41:26,200
I like that.

1024
01:41:26,200 --> 01:41:28,200
Where did it go?

1025
01:41:30,200 --> 01:41:32,200
Looks like I will not get it back.

1026
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:33,200
Oh, that's right.

1027
01:41:33,200 --> 01:41:35,200
It takes five seconds to do it now.

1028
01:41:35,200 --> 01:41:37,200
I was thinking I had to retrieve it.

1029
01:41:45,200 --> 01:41:46,200
That's nice actually.

1030
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:49,200
Because then it just takes me five seconds to wait for the cast to come back.

1031
01:41:49,200 --> 01:41:51,200
Which is pretty cool.

1032
01:41:51,200 --> 01:41:53,200
There's something spawned behind me.

1033
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:56,200
Yeah, that's pretty nifty.

1034
01:41:56,200 --> 01:41:58,200
I don't...

1035
01:41:58,200 --> 01:42:00,200
Oh, that's actually nice.

1036
01:42:00,200 --> 01:42:02,200
Cool.

1037
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:05,200
I wish you would give me a boon, but that's fine.

1038
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:08,200
I'm the wrong soul.

1039
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:10,200
What the hell?

1040
01:42:10,200 --> 01:42:12,200
Oh, I'm not paying attention.

1041
01:42:12,200 --> 01:42:13,200
Sorry, I'm reading chat.

1042
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:15,200
Electric slide.

1043
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:24,200
Wow.

1044
01:42:24,200 --> 01:42:26,200
What are you guys hiding in there for?

1045
01:42:31,200 --> 01:42:33,200
Oh, no.

1046
01:42:33,200 --> 01:42:34,200
I can die.

1047
01:42:34,200 --> 01:42:36,200
I mean, I didn't get it.

1048
01:42:39,200 --> 01:42:40,200
All right, give me a boon.

1049
01:42:40,200 --> 01:42:42,200
No, we're not.

1050
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:47,200
I could go to Chaos Land.

1051
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:51,200
Honestly, the temptation's there.

1052
01:42:51,200 --> 01:42:55,200
I want to give like a nectar to Chaos.

1053
01:42:55,200 --> 01:42:57,200
That'd be funny.

1054
01:43:03,200 --> 01:43:05,200
Okay, you know what?

1055
01:43:05,200 --> 01:43:06,200
Let's do it.

1056
01:43:06,200 --> 01:43:08,200
I have the health for it.

1057
01:43:08,200 --> 01:43:10,200
Let me have it.

1058
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:16,200
Darkness.

1059
01:43:16,200 --> 01:43:18,200
Oh, darkness.

1060
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:23,200
This is like one of my favorite designs I've ever seen in my life.

1061
01:43:28,200 --> 01:43:31,200
It's very cool that they react to what you're holding.

1062
01:43:32,200 --> 01:43:34,200
I think that's nice.

1063
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:39,200
Lex, you're kind of your dash.

1064
01:43:42,200 --> 01:43:44,200
Oh, I don't care about getting money.

1065
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:46,200
That's fine.

1066
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:51,200
72% more foes to be rare about.

1067
01:43:51,200 --> 01:43:55,200
Oh, that's fine.

1068
01:43:55,200 --> 01:43:57,200
Two and three are nice.

1069
01:43:59,200 --> 01:44:01,200
Fascinating.

1070
01:44:02,200 --> 01:44:04,200
Fascinating indeed.

1071
01:44:06,200 --> 01:44:08,200
I think I'll go with three.

1072
01:44:09,200 --> 01:44:11,200
Oh, son of babies.

1073
01:44:11,200 --> 01:44:13,200
Oh, and then you let me pick where I want to go.

1074
01:44:13,200 --> 01:44:15,200
That's pretty sick, actually.

1075
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:17,200
I kind of want keys though.

1076
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:19,200
So I can unlock more stuff.

1077
01:44:22,200 --> 01:44:24,200
Oh, oh, oh my.

1078
01:44:25,200 --> 01:44:27,200
Oh, can you?

1079
01:44:28,200 --> 01:44:30,200
It's a show.

1080
01:44:31,200 --> 01:44:34,200
I don't recall you guys being able to throw that much.

1081
01:44:39,200 --> 01:44:41,200
That's right.

1082
01:44:54,200 --> 01:44:56,200
All right, what do you got for me?

1083
01:44:56,200 --> 01:44:58,200
Oh, come on, please.

1084
01:44:58,200 --> 01:45:00,200
Blaze.

1085
01:45:00,200 --> 01:45:02,200
I just want good foods.

1086
01:45:04,200 --> 01:45:07,200
Oh, you guys are so freaking annoying.

1087
01:45:09,200 --> 01:45:12,200
I think I can, like, break them.

1088
01:45:13,200 --> 01:45:16,200
But, like, sometimes I can't always hit them like that.

1089
01:45:20,200 --> 01:45:23,200
If I stand right in front of them, I'm fine.

1090
01:45:25,200 --> 01:45:26,200
Yeah.

1091
01:45:26,200 --> 01:45:28,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1092
01:45:28,200 --> 01:45:30,200
Oh, hey.

1093
01:45:30,200 --> 01:45:31,200
Hey, mama.

1094
01:45:31,200 --> 01:45:33,200
Hey, upper diney.

1095
01:45:33,200 --> 01:45:35,200
What's up, clean?

1096
01:45:35,200 --> 01:45:37,200
You and me.

1097
01:45:37,200 --> 01:45:39,200
You're boneless.

1098
01:45:39,200 --> 01:45:40,200
Oh.

1099
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:42,200
I don't have a lot of good stuff.

1100
01:45:44,200 --> 01:45:45,200
Thanks.

1101
01:45:47,200 --> 01:45:49,200
You're dashed.

1102
01:45:49,200 --> 01:45:51,200
I don't want to be dead.

1103
01:45:52,200 --> 01:45:54,200
I don't want to be dead.

1104
01:46:03,200 --> 01:46:06,200
I mean, all right, I just want someone to move.

1105
01:46:12,200 --> 01:46:16,200
Because I don't get my higher attack until...

1106
01:46:16,200 --> 01:46:18,200
Oh, god.

1107
01:46:18,200 --> 01:46:21,200
I go through three rooms, so I'm sorry.

1108
01:46:32,200 --> 01:46:34,200
Oh, goodness.

1109
01:46:41,200 --> 01:46:43,200
You're killing me.

1110
01:46:44,200 --> 01:46:47,200
No, at least you're stumblobs now.

1111
01:46:52,200 --> 01:46:54,200
Oh, that took too long.

1112
01:46:58,200 --> 01:47:00,200
There, at least you're stumblobs.

1113
01:47:00,200 --> 01:47:01,200
That's cute.

1114
01:47:01,200 --> 01:47:03,200
I might be closer to you, actually.

1115
01:47:07,200 --> 01:47:09,200
There we go.

1116
01:47:14,200 --> 01:47:16,200
You were all related.

1117
01:47:18,200 --> 01:47:20,200
You're literally like my cousin.

1118
01:47:20,200 --> 01:47:22,200
Bye-bye.

1119
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:24,200
Thank you for stopping by.

1120
01:47:29,200 --> 01:47:31,200
She's not wearing any clothes.

1121
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:33,200
She's no outfit.

1122
01:47:33,200 --> 01:47:34,200
Imagine?

1123
01:47:34,200 --> 01:47:37,200
She being after daddy's outfit to super long hair.

1124
01:47:38,200 --> 01:47:41,200
She's just learning to stun tech.

1125
01:47:52,200 --> 01:47:54,200
I'm going to take this epic.

1126
01:47:56,200 --> 01:47:58,200
I need a good dash.

1127
01:47:58,200 --> 01:48:00,200
I need a good dash desperately.

1128
01:48:00,200 --> 01:48:03,200
Poseidon, baby boy, where are you?

1129
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:05,200
Where are you?

1130
01:48:07,200 --> 01:48:09,200
Grease the original, Obama.

1131
01:48:13,200 --> 01:48:15,200
Oh, my.

1132
01:48:15,200 --> 01:48:17,200
I didn't see you there.

1133
01:48:23,200 --> 01:48:24,200
Fast.

1134
01:48:24,200 --> 01:48:26,200
Yeah.

1135
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:31,200
Ha-ha, bitch.

1136
01:48:34,200 --> 01:48:35,200
All right.

1137
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:40,200
Okay, Zeus, give me some lightning sprint, please.

1138
01:48:43,200 --> 01:48:46,200
Oh, I thought I was going to fall down there for some reason.

1139
01:48:51,200 --> 01:48:53,200
Stay out of range.

1140
01:49:03,200 --> 01:49:05,200
Stay out of range.

1141
01:49:18,200 --> 01:49:19,200
Sick.

1142
01:49:19,200 --> 01:49:21,200
In the name of Hades.

1143
01:49:21,200 --> 01:49:23,200
What's up, Zeus?

1144
01:49:23,200 --> 01:49:25,200
Thunderdash.

1145
01:49:25,200 --> 01:49:27,200
Oh, but my attack.

1146
01:49:29,200 --> 01:49:31,200
Oh, virtual damage.

1147
01:49:32,200 --> 01:49:34,200
Oh, frick.

1148
01:49:36,200 --> 01:49:38,200
I don't know which one to pick.

1149
01:49:41,200 --> 01:49:45,200
Yeah, the static discharge sounds good.

1150
01:49:50,200 --> 01:49:52,200
Because I would...

1151
01:49:53,200 --> 01:49:54,200
victims this.

1152
01:49:54,200 --> 01:49:55,200
Yeah.

1153
01:49:56,200 --> 01:49:58,200
That's good for crowd control.

1154
01:50:02,200 --> 01:50:04,200
Oh, yeah.

1155
01:50:04,200 --> 01:50:06,200
I'll do static discharge.

1156
01:50:07,200 --> 01:50:09,200
Hopefully we get another boon.

1157
01:50:09,200 --> 01:50:10,200
Oh, perfect.

1158
01:50:10,200 --> 01:50:11,200
Oh, shh.

1159
01:50:12,200 --> 01:50:15,200
Okay, we're going to do the hammer because it will help.

1160
01:50:17,200 --> 01:50:19,200
Although I normally would love to talk to Aphrodite.

1161
01:50:32,200 --> 01:50:35,200
How do they miss you?

1162
01:50:35,200 --> 01:50:36,200
How do they...

1163
01:50:36,200 --> 01:50:39,200
How can they throw these so far is my question?

1164
01:50:39,200 --> 01:50:40,200
Ow.

1165
01:50:40,200 --> 01:50:42,200
That is my question.

1166
01:50:50,200 --> 01:50:51,200
Okay.

1167
01:50:52,200 --> 01:50:54,200
Yes, yes, yes.

1168
01:50:54,200 --> 01:50:55,200
I love the chain.

1169
01:50:55,200 --> 01:50:56,200
I love the chain.

1170
01:50:56,200 --> 01:50:58,200
The chain is my favorite.

1171
01:50:58,200 --> 01:51:00,200
Is there like...

1172
01:51:00,200 --> 01:51:03,200
Can I have, like, some health, please?

1173
01:51:03,200 --> 01:51:06,200
Is there any, like, trial that I could do?

1174
01:51:09,200 --> 01:51:12,200
I said chains, not trains.

1175
01:51:14,200 --> 01:51:16,200
You sick bastards.

1176
01:51:18,200 --> 01:51:20,200
Like, that's great.

1177
01:51:20,200 --> 01:51:21,200
Oh, what?

1178
01:51:21,200 --> 01:51:23,200
Why did you spawn in the same spot?

1179
01:51:24,200 --> 01:51:25,200
Chain.

1180
01:51:26,200 --> 01:51:28,200
I'm close to death chain.

1181
01:51:33,200 --> 01:51:34,200
Oh.

1182
01:51:36,200 --> 01:51:37,200
I love it.

1183
01:51:40,200 --> 01:51:41,200
Like, like, look at this.

1184
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:42,200
Look at that.

1185
01:51:43,200 --> 01:51:45,200
It's great for these dudes.

1186
01:51:55,200 --> 01:51:56,200
What?

1187
01:51:56,200 --> 01:51:57,200
Oh.

1188
01:51:57,200 --> 01:51:58,200
I'm like, hello?

1189
01:51:58,200 --> 01:52:00,200
Can I grab the key?

1190
01:52:03,200 --> 01:52:04,200
Ever get...

1191
01:52:04,200 --> 01:52:05,200
This is...

1192
01:52:06,200 --> 01:52:07,200
Who is this again?

1193
01:52:07,200 --> 01:52:09,200
Is this, um, Sisyphus?

1194
01:52:10,200 --> 01:52:12,200
Is that Sisyphus' symbol?

1195
01:52:15,200 --> 01:52:16,200
Okay.

1196
01:52:16,200 --> 01:52:18,200
I'll go see Sisyphus.

1197
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:20,200
Okay.

1198
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:22,200
I'll go see Sisyphus.

1199
01:52:22,200 --> 01:52:24,200
I'll go see Sisyphus.

1200
01:52:28,200 --> 01:52:29,200
Hey!

1201
01:52:30,200 --> 01:52:31,200
It's...

1202
01:52:31,200 --> 01:52:33,200
I would take you with me, to be honest.

1203
01:52:33,200 --> 01:52:34,200
You go through a lot.

1204
01:52:35,200 --> 01:52:37,200
I forget what you even did.

1205
01:52:40,200 --> 01:52:42,200
I was a fire-stepping youngster.

1206
01:52:42,200 --> 01:52:44,200
I was a fire-stepping youngster.

1207
01:52:52,200 --> 01:52:54,200
Yeah, cause he'll give me more healing.

1208
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:55,200
Easy does it.

1209
01:52:55,200 --> 01:52:57,200
Yeah, cause that would have only given me, like,

1210
01:52:57,200 --> 01:52:59,200
a little bit of healing.

1211
01:53:01,200 --> 01:53:02,200
Yeah, that's fine.

1212
01:53:03,200 --> 01:53:05,200
I can talk to a bouldie?

1213
01:53:07,200 --> 01:53:08,200
I can't...

1214
01:53:08,200 --> 01:53:09,200
What do you talk about?

1215
01:53:09,200 --> 01:53:11,200
I can't talk to the boulder?

1216
01:53:11,200 --> 01:53:13,200
Cause the ghost was like,

1217
01:53:17,200 --> 01:53:19,200
Talk to his friend?

1218
01:53:19,200 --> 01:53:20,200
What friend?

1219
01:53:21,200 --> 01:53:23,200
I can't talk to him.

1220
01:53:31,200 --> 01:53:33,200
I'm not trying hard enough?

1221
01:53:35,200 --> 01:53:37,200
Why does it have a face, actually?

1222
01:53:37,200 --> 01:53:39,200
That's a little disconcerting.

1223
01:53:42,200 --> 01:53:43,200
Cool.

1224
01:53:47,200 --> 01:53:49,200
Any of you good enough friends with Sisyphus?

1225
01:53:49,200 --> 01:53:51,200
Alright, maybe if I give him...

1226
01:53:51,200 --> 01:53:52,200
I don't think I give...

1227
01:53:52,200 --> 01:53:53,200
No, I did give him a...

1228
01:53:53,200 --> 01:53:56,200
a nectar, so I'm surprised you can't talk to him.

1229
01:53:57,200 --> 01:53:58,200
Bye!

1230
01:53:58,200 --> 01:53:59,200
Bye, Sisyphus!

1231
01:54:01,200 --> 01:54:02,200
Oh!

1232
01:54:05,200 --> 01:54:07,200
I don't have any money.

1233
01:54:07,200 --> 01:54:09,200
I'll take this, though.

1234
01:54:09,200 --> 01:54:10,200
Hi, what's going on?

1235
01:54:11,200 --> 01:54:13,200
If there happens to be something really horrible

1236
01:54:13,200 --> 01:54:15,200
awaiting me beyond that door, then...

1237
01:54:18,200 --> 01:54:21,200
I like how Karen's just, like, this wacky-looking spirit.

1238
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:29,200
He's done an all-chaos run?

1239
01:54:29,200 --> 01:54:30,200
Oh.

1240
01:54:34,200 --> 01:54:35,200
Hi, Meg.

1241
01:54:35,200 --> 01:54:36,200
Hi.

1242
01:54:37,200 --> 01:54:38,200
Listen to me, Zacharias.

1243
01:54:38,200 --> 01:54:40,200
Your mother is long gone.

1244
01:54:40,200 --> 01:54:42,200
Why do you have to be a bitch about that?

1245
01:54:48,200 --> 01:54:50,200
You're kind of rude for that.

1246
01:54:52,200 --> 01:54:54,200
Yeah, it's not your business, lady.

1247
01:54:54,200 --> 01:54:55,200
Like, ah, you're hot and all,

1248
01:54:55,200 --> 01:54:57,200
but you can't talk about my mom that way.

1249
01:55:01,200 --> 01:55:03,200
I don't think I'm going to be able to get her this time,

1250
01:55:03,200 --> 01:55:05,200
because I don't have a week.

1251
01:55:06,200 --> 01:55:07,200
And I'm a lot.

1252
01:55:11,200 --> 01:55:13,200
I don't have the Depthify.

1253
01:55:22,200 --> 01:55:24,200
I don't have the extra Sprint either.

1254
01:55:30,200 --> 01:55:32,200
Oh, yeah, let's just turn this off.

1255
01:55:33,200 --> 01:55:34,200
Ow!

1256
01:55:34,200 --> 01:55:35,200
I don't know.

1257
01:55:41,200 --> 01:55:42,200
Oh!

1258
01:55:46,200 --> 01:55:47,200
Spam, let's grab it.

1259
01:56:00,200 --> 01:56:01,200
Just a geiger.

1260
01:56:05,200 --> 01:56:06,200
I'm trying to get him here.

1261
01:56:10,200 --> 01:56:11,200
I'm trying to get him here.

1262
01:56:23,200 --> 01:56:24,200
Ow.

1263
01:56:25,200 --> 01:56:26,200
Oh, okay.

1264
01:56:28,200 --> 01:56:30,200
I'm not quite playing something.

1265
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:36,200
Hold on.

1266
01:56:41,200 --> 01:56:42,200
Okay.

1267
01:56:54,200 --> 01:56:55,200
What the heck is she doing?

1268
01:56:57,200 --> 01:56:58,200
That was funny.

1269
01:56:58,200 --> 01:56:59,200
Sorry, I'm locked in.

1270
01:56:59,200 --> 01:57:00,200
Good.

1271
01:57:08,200 --> 01:57:10,200
Stop with the stupid circles.

1272
01:57:14,200 --> 01:57:15,200
I'm tired of this grandpa.

1273
01:57:17,200 --> 01:57:18,200
I was out of the way.

1274
01:57:18,200 --> 01:57:19,200
That doesn't make any sense.

1275
01:57:27,200 --> 01:57:28,200
Oh, my God.

1276
01:57:30,200 --> 01:57:31,200
Oh, my God.

1277
01:57:37,200 --> 01:57:39,200
Oh, Christ, not the stupid circles.

1278
01:57:47,200 --> 01:57:49,200
I don't know, I didn't want to walk on hands.

1279
01:57:50,200 --> 01:57:51,200
Stop!

1280
01:57:55,200 --> 01:57:57,200
I don't even know where she is.

1281
01:57:58,200 --> 01:57:59,200
I'm stuck.

1282
01:58:03,200 --> 01:58:05,200
The neighbor's dog is barking.

1283
01:58:06,200 --> 01:58:08,200
You're so close to death.

1284
01:58:08,200 --> 01:58:09,200
Just die.

1285
01:58:13,200 --> 01:58:16,200
I suppose I did because I got too freaking greedy.

1286
01:58:21,200 --> 01:58:22,200
I was kind of over.

1287
01:58:22,200 --> 01:58:24,200
I didn't like that run anyways, to be honest.

1288
01:58:25,200 --> 01:58:27,200
Hypness must be on price.

1289
01:58:31,200 --> 01:58:32,200
Oh, Jesus is there.

1290
01:58:34,200 --> 01:58:35,200
Hey, Dad.

1291
01:58:39,200 --> 01:58:41,200
Oh, would you hide that I exist?

1292
01:58:48,200 --> 01:58:50,200
It's funny because Nix is like Haiti's mom.

1293
01:58:50,200 --> 01:58:51,200
It's all mythology.

1294
01:58:55,200 --> 01:58:59,200
And it's like he thought that his grandma was his mom.

1295
01:59:01,200 --> 01:59:02,200
What was that?

1296
01:59:03,200 --> 01:59:06,200
That run-of-the-mill, like, surprise noise.

1297
01:59:10,200 --> 01:59:11,200
You tell him, Nix.

1298
01:59:12,200 --> 01:59:15,200
One of the best designs in the game as well, aside from chaos.

1299
01:59:17,200 --> 01:59:18,200
Oh!

1300
01:59:18,200 --> 01:59:19,200
Why did you do that?

1301
01:59:19,200 --> 01:59:21,200
You made step-mommy upset.

1302
01:59:22,200 --> 01:59:24,200
I can't believe you've done this.

1303
01:59:24,200 --> 01:59:25,200
I don't have enough for that.

1304
01:59:28,200 --> 01:59:30,200
Meg is employee of the month again, probably because she killed me.

1305
01:59:31,200 --> 01:59:32,200
Wait, no!

1306
01:59:32,200 --> 01:59:35,200
Dusa, Dusa, Dusa, Dusa, Dusa, my beloved.

1307
01:59:35,200 --> 01:59:36,200
Dusa, Dusa.

1308
01:59:36,200 --> 01:59:37,200
No!

1309
01:59:39,200 --> 01:59:40,200
Oh, there she is.

1310
01:59:41,200 --> 01:59:42,200
Dusa, Dusa, Dusa.

1311
01:59:42,200 --> 01:59:43,200
Hi.

1312
01:59:43,200 --> 01:59:44,200
Oh, my God.

1313
01:59:44,200 --> 01:59:45,200
Are you blushing?

1314
01:59:46,200 --> 01:59:48,200
You know what I'd like to use your head for, Dusa?

1315
01:59:48,200 --> 01:59:50,200
You know what I'd like to use your head for.

1316
01:59:52,200 --> 01:59:54,200
Kissing, because you're so cute.

1317
02:00:07,200 --> 02:00:09,200
I don't have enough cathodicase.

1318
02:00:14,200 --> 02:00:16,200
It's cool that I can, like, reset everything and just...

1319
02:00:16,200 --> 02:00:18,200
I could put it all in death defiance.

1320
02:00:22,200 --> 02:00:23,200
Oh.

1321
02:00:23,200 --> 02:00:24,200
Yo.

1322
02:00:24,200 --> 02:00:26,200
Yeah, let's do that.

1323
02:00:28,200 --> 02:00:31,200
Mira, is the Mira going to start talking to me?

1324
02:00:33,200 --> 02:00:36,200
Why do you keep wanting to talk to me about stuff I already know?

1325
02:00:39,200 --> 02:00:41,200
Smack guys against the wall.

1326
02:00:41,200 --> 02:00:42,200
Smack, my bitch.

1327
02:00:42,200 --> 02:00:44,200
Oh, hi, Boomi.

1328
02:00:44,200 --> 02:00:45,200
Hi, handsome.

1329
02:00:45,200 --> 02:00:46,200
What's going on?

1330
02:00:46,200 --> 02:00:48,200
Oh, you look a mighty E.P.

1331
02:00:48,200 --> 02:00:50,200
How are you up to?

1332
02:00:50,200 --> 02:00:52,200
What are you doing, E.P. boy things?

1333
02:00:54,200 --> 02:00:56,200
Why don't you lay in the bed?

1334
02:00:56,200 --> 02:00:57,200
I have it right here.

1335
02:00:58,200 --> 02:00:59,200
Boomi, you can't lay on...

1336
02:00:59,200 --> 02:01:00,200
Where are you going?

1337
02:01:02,200 --> 02:01:03,200
Boomi.

1338
02:01:04,200 --> 02:01:05,200
Oh, Boomi boy.

1339
02:01:05,200 --> 02:01:07,200
You gotta go over here.

1340
02:01:07,200 --> 02:01:08,200
Thank you.

1341
02:01:09,200 --> 02:01:10,200
Lay down, big man.

1342
02:01:14,200 --> 02:01:15,200
Oh.

1343
02:01:16,200 --> 02:01:17,200
Boomi pets.

1344
02:01:18,200 --> 02:01:20,200
Where are you going?

1345
02:01:21,200 --> 02:01:22,200
Just lay in the bed.

1346
02:01:22,200 --> 02:01:24,200
Why are you trying to leave?

1347
02:01:27,200 --> 02:01:29,200
Is this bed not up to your standards?

1348
02:01:29,200 --> 02:01:33,200
Is it because it's usually Raina's bed and I put it up on the desk and you prefer the other beds?

1349
02:01:38,200 --> 02:01:39,200
Where are you going?

1350
02:01:39,200 --> 02:01:43,200
He's just walking around my desk and standing in the way of everything.

1351
02:01:43,200 --> 02:01:44,200
I can't see my screen.

1352
02:01:47,200 --> 02:01:49,200
He under says his pouch is in danger.

1353
02:01:49,200 --> 02:01:50,200
Whoa, attack the pouch.

1354
02:01:50,200 --> 02:01:52,200
Squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak.

1355
02:01:52,200 --> 02:01:53,200
He doesn't even care.

1356
02:01:55,200 --> 02:01:57,200
Live pouch squeaking.

1357
02:01:58,200 --> 02:01:59,200
Do you just want pets?

1358
02:01:59,200 --> 02:02:00,200
I can give you pets.

1359
02:02:00,200 --> 02:02:01,200
How about that?

1360
02:02:01,200 --> 02:02:04,200
I'll give you some pets because it seems like you just want pets.

1361
02:02:04,200 --> 02:02:05,200
Hi.

1362
02:02:05,200 --> 02:02:07,200
Oh, the head rubs.

1363
02:02:07,200 --> 02:02:09,200
Oh, yes.

1364
02:02:09,200 --> 02:02:10,200
Pet, pet, pet.

1365
02:02:13,200 --> 02:02:16,200
Uh-oh, Boomi Slayer is about to be on the case.

1366
02:02:17,200 --> 02:02:18,200
Oh, Boomi.

1367
02:02:18,200 --> 02:02:19,200
Are you purring?

1368
02:02:19,200 --> 02:02:21,200
No, you're not purring, sadly.

1369
02:02:21,200 --> 02:02:24,200
You're giving me all this love, but you won't even dane a purr.

1370
02:02:24,200 --> 02:02:25,200
How dare.

1371
02:02:26,200 --> 02:02:28,200
Oh, you're scratching your chin.

1372
02:02:29,200 --> 02:02:31,200
You're scratching your chin.

1373
02:02:35,200 --> 02:02:37,200
Oh, I get a little rumble.

1374
02:02:37,200 --> 02:02:38,200
Okay.

1375
02:02:39,200 --> 02:02:41,200
Yeah, Boomi doesn't purr that often either.

1376
02:02:44,200 --> 02:02:45,200
Hi.

1377
02:02:45,200 --> 02:02:46,200
Oh, hello.

1378
02:02:46,200 --> 02:02:49,200
Oh, you're being so sweet today.

1379
02:02:49,200 --> 02:02:51,200
Are you trying to clear your name?

1380
02:02:55,200 --> 02:02:56,200
He has full purrs.

1381
02:02:56,200 --> 02:03:00,200
Yeah, I haven't got like a full on purr from him since he was a little kitten.

1382
02:03:00,200 --> 02:03:03,200
He's just a very reserved young man.

1383
02:03:03,200 --> 02:03:05,200
Too good for me, his mother.

1384
02:03:05,200 --> 02:03:08,200
He's in his teenage years being a year old.

1385
02:03:08,200 --> 02:03:10,200
Oh, he's your boy.

1386
02:03:10,200 --> 02:03:12,200
Boomi, you can't stand there though.

1387
02:03:13,200 --> 02:03:16,200
Are you going to, do you want to hug?

1388
02:03:16,200 --> 02:03:17,200
Is that what you want?

1389
02:03:17,200 --> 02:03:19,200
Are you asking for a hug?

1390
02:03:19,200 --> 02:03:21,200
You're looking at me like you want to hug.

1391
02:03:21,200 --> 02:03:22,200
Oh.

1392
02:03:23,200 --> 02:03:25,200
Then you moved in microphone.

1393
02:03:25,200 --> 02:03:26,200
Do you want to hug?

1394
02:03:26,200 --> 02:03:27,200
Boomi, come here.

1395
02:03:27,200 --> 02:03:29,200
Boomi, come here.

1396
02:03:29,200 --> 02:03:31,200
Do you want to hug?

1397
02:03:32,200 --> 02:03:33,200
Come on.

1398
02:03:34,200 --> 02:03:36,200
You're thinking about it.

1399
02:03:36,200 --> 02:03:38,200
You're thinking about it.

1400
02:03:38,200 --> 02:03:43,200
Sometimes he'll reach up and ask to climb onto my shoulder for a little hug.

1401
02:03:44,200 --> 02:03:47,200
Oh, why are you being so sweet right now?

1402
02:03:48,200 --> 02:03:50,200
Why don't you just want some love?

1403
02:03:50,200 --> 02:03:52,200
I'll give you some love.

1404
02:03:53,200 --> 02:03:56,200
He's so clingy, but he's not.

1405
02:04:02,200 --> 02:04:04,200
All right, where are you going, boy?

1406
02:04:04,200 --> 02:04:06,200
Where are you going?

1407
02:04:07,200 --> 02:04:08,200
Are you?

1408
02:04:09,200 --> 02:04:11,200
Are you stepping on my lap?

1409
02:04:11,200 --> 02:04:13,200
He's rubbing against the microphone.

1410
02:04:13,200 --> 02:04:18,200
Are you giving me headbutts and putting your paws on my lap like you're going to come snug?

1411
02:04:19,200 --> 02:04:21,200
Are you going to...

1412
02:04:22,200 --> 02:04:23,200
Oh my God.

1413
02:04:25,200 --> 02:04:27,200
Oh, Boomi hug.

1414
02:04:27,200 --> 02:04:29,200
Oh, thank you.

1415
02:04:30,200 --> 02:04:32,200
What a good boy.

1416
02:04:33,200 --> 02:04:35,200
Such a good boy.

1417
02:04:36,200 --> 02:04:39,200
He just climbed onto my shoulder.

1418
02:04:41,200 --> 02:04:43,200
This makes me so happy.

1419
02:04:43,200 --> 02:04:45,200
He doesn't do this too often.

1420
02:04:46,200 --> 02:04:47,200
Hello.

1421
02:04:49,200 --> 02:04:51,200
You just want to hug?

1422
02:04:54,200 --> 02:04:57,200
He's really having a moment.

1423
02:04:57,200 --> 02:04:59,200
Let me have this, okay?

1424
02:04:59,200 --> 02:05:00,200
This is rare.

1425
02:05:00,200 --> 02:05:02,200
Oh, hi.

1426
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:08,200
Hello.

1427
02:05:15,200 --> 02:05:18,200
He's embracing the cuddles.

1428
02:05:20,200 --> 02:05:22,200
Can you please get your butt out of my face though?

1429
02:05:22,200 --> 02:05:24,200
Okay, he climbed off my shoulder.

1430
02:05:24,200 --> 02:05:26,200
He's like, that's enough.

1431
02:05:27,200 --> 02:05:30,200
Where will you go, sir?

1432
02:05:30,200 --> 02:05:32,200
Will you go where the winds take you?

1433
02:05:32,200 --> 02:05:34,200
He literally just snuggled me and left.

1434
02:05:34,200 --> 02:05:36,200
He's actually really cute.

1435
02:05:37,200 --> 02:05:38,200
He never steals.

1436
02:05:38,200 --> 02:05:39,200
What do you mean?

1437
02:05:39,200 --> 02:05:42,200
He's always stealing Fiya's food when I'm preparing it for her.

1438
02:05:42,200 --> 02:05:44,200
For her syringe.

1439
02:05:44,200 --> 02:05:48,200
And I have to like, I whisk it into a mousse before I put in the syringe.

1440
02:05:48,200 --> 02:05:53,200
He'll always try to come and take the bowl away from me.

1441
02:05:59,200 --> 02:06:01,200
Slander.

1442
02:06:01,200 --> 02:06:04,200
It's not slander if it's fact.

1443
02:06:04,200 --> 02:06:09,200
Bumi has his moments, but he will always steal from his sister.

1444
02:06:10,200 --> 02:06:12,200
Which is the way of things.

1445
02:06:12,200 --> 02:06:14,200
Thank you for your snuggles, my people.

1446
02:06:14,200 --> 02:06:16,200
Literally though.

1447
02:06:17,200 --> 02:06:19,200
Oh, that was really sweet.

1448
02:06:20,200 --> 02:06:21,200
Oh, hello.

1449
02:06:26,200 --> 02:06:28,200
He has such voluptuous hair.

1450
02:06:31,200 --> 02:06:32,200
Ooh.

1451
02:06:43,200 --> 02:06:46,200
I can't even see past these freaking things.

1452
02:06:49,200 --> 02:06:52,200
My neighbor's dog is barking so much and it's really annoying.

1453
02:06:57,200 --> 02:06:58,200
Oh, no.

1454
02:06:58,200 --> 02:07:00,200
That was stupid.

1455
02:07:01,200 --> 02:07:02,200
Oh, my.

1456
02:07:13,200 --> 02:07:15,200
Okay, I already got a palm.

1457
02:07:17,200 --> 02:07:18,200
Drunken Dash.

1458
02:07:19,200 --> 02:07:21,200
Drunken Fist.

1459
02:07:22,200 --> 02:07:23,200
Oh.

1460
02:07:30,200 --> 02:07:31,200
Does the hangover...

1461
02:07:32,200 --> 02:07:33,200
Oh, wow.

1462
02:07:34,200 --> 02:07:36,200
Is that like, sundown momentarily?

1463
02:07:39,200 --> 02:07:42,200
I don't even know what, like, the effects of names this one would be due.

1464
02:07:45,200 --> 02:07:47,200
I like how they all get so surprised.

1465
02:07:52,200 --> 02:07:54,200
The power of the gods.

1466
02:07:55,200 --> 02:07:56,200
Juicy.

1467
02:07:56,200 --> 02:07:57,200
Juicy.

1468
02:07:57,200 --> 02:07:59,200
Oh, please.

1469
02:07:59,200 --> 02:08:00,200
This is, ugh.

1470
02:08:00,200 --> 02:08:05,200
Lately, I feel like in my later runs, I am just not getting boons.

1471
02:08:05,200 --> 02:08:12,200
I'm literally just getting, like, random, like, the status upgrades or, like, whatever, great status.

1472
02:08:14,200 --> 02:08:15,200
What are they called?

1473
02:08:16,200 --> 02:08:17,200
Oh.

1474
02:08:19,200 --> 02:08:20,200
Like the...

1475
02:08:20,200 --> 02:08:21,200
You pay for it?

1476
02:08:21,200 --> 02:08:22,200
Oh, my God, what am I doing?

1477
02:08:23,200 --> 02:08:26,200
Like, those are great, but you guys know what I'm trying to say.

1478
02:08:26,200 --> 02:08:30,200
But I just, I really need, I need, I don't care about coins.

1479
02:08:33,200 --> 02:08:35,200
Hangovers, basically, poison.

1480
02:08:35,200 --> 02:08:36,200
Oh, okay.

1481
02:08:37,200 --> 02:08:38,200
Yeah, yeah.

1482
02:08:38,200 --> 02:08:39,200
You get poisoned.

1483
02:08:46,200 --> 02:08:47,200
Poison's dead.

1484
02:08:51,200 --> 02:08:54,200
Get poisoned, get poisoned, get poisoned.

1485
02:08:57,200 --> 02:09:00,200
Well, I feel so slow after dashing around for five minutes.

1486
02:09:01,200 --> 02:09:02,200
Get poisoned.

1487
02:09:04,200 --> 02:09:05,200
That was actually helpful.

1488
02:09:06,200 --> 02:09:07,200
Alright, please.

1489
02:09:08,200 --> 02:09:09,200
Aphrodite, thank you.

1490
02:09:12,200 --> 02:09:13,200
Aphrodite, my queen.

1491
02:09:16,200 --> 02:09:17,200
Aphrodite.

1492
02:09:19,200 --> 02:09:20,200
My reaches.

1493
02:09:21,200 --> 02:09:22,200
Very insane indeed.

1494
02:09:22,200 --> 02:09:23,200
Okay, that was very easy.

1495
02:09:23,200 --> 02:09:24,200
Aphrodite, you should.

1496
02:09:26,200 --> 02:09:27,200
Oh.

1497
02:09:32,200 --> 02:09:33,200
Do you?

1498
02:09:33,200 --> 02:09:34,200
Do you want some of this?

1499
02:09:34,200 --> 02:09:36,200
Actually, no, I don't want to piss off Aries.

1500
02:09:38,200 --> 02:09:39,200
It's very veeler.

1501
02:09:40,200 --> 02:09:43,200
I saw, there's like a VTuber group called V-Kiss.

1502
02:09:43,200 --> 02:09:46,200
I know Kozichi was in it, which I think is super cute.

1503
02:09:46,200 --> 02:09:49,200
And I just thought of V-Kiss, V-Sucky.

1504
02:09:56,200 --> 02:09:58,200
I will do the heartbreak flourish again.

1505
02:10:00,200 --> 02:10:03,200
Oh, Poseidon, Poseidon, Poseidon, please.

1506
02:10:04,200 --> 02:10:07,200
Poseidon, please, please, please, please, please, please, please.

1507
02:10:09,200 --> 02:10:12,200
Poseidon, please, please, please, please, please, please, please.

1508
02:10:15,200 --> 02:10:18,200
Poseidon, please, please, please, please, please, please.

1509
02:10:20,200 --> 02:10:21,200
Ah!

1510
02:10:21,200 --> 02:10:22,200
I might die, actually.

1511
02:10:28,200 --> 02:10:29,200
I don't have a kind of a watch.

1512
02:10:29,200 --> 02:10:30,200
Ah!

1513
02:10:35,200 --> 02:10:37,200
Now, my nose is itchy.

1514
02:10:39,200 --> 02:10:41,200
Maybe I should have done a heartbreak.

1515
02:10:44,200 --> 02:10:46,200
Please, where'd you dead yet?

1516
02:10:48,200 --> 02:10:50,200
There's like a stomachache.

1517
02:10:53,200 --> 02:10:54,200
Jesus.

1518
02:10:54,200 --> 02:10:56,200
Poseidon!

1519
02:10:58,200 --> 02:11:00,200
Xobot, my VTuber face is ending.

1520
02:11:00,200 --> 02:11:01,200
Here's money, goodbye.

1521
02:11:01,200 --> 02:11:02,200
What?

1522
02:11:02,200 --> 02:11:03,200
What do you mean?

1523
02:11:05,200 --> 02:11:07,200
Where are you going?

1524
02:11:08,200 --> 02:11:09,200
You can never leave.

1525
02:11:09,200 --> 02:11:10,200
I will not let you.

1526
02:11:10,200 --> 02:11:15,200
I will take my nails and dig them into your skin and you will never leave me.

1527
02:11:17,200 --> 02:11:19,200
VTuber face never ends.

1528
02:11:19,200 --> 02:11:20,200
You'll be back.

1529
02:11:20,200 --> 02:11:21,200
Bye for now.

1530
02:11:21,200 --> 02:11:23,200
Thank you for the Supa Exo, though.

1531
02:11:23,200 --> 02:11:24,200
I hope you are okay.

1532
02:11:27,200 --> 02:11:29,200
He broke the cycle.

1533
02:11:29,200 --> 02:11:30,200
Be safe.

1534
02:11:33,200 --> 02:11:34,200
I hope you will return.

1535
02:11:38,200 --> 02:11:43,200
And I hope in your absence you do what makes you happy.

1536
02:11:43,200 --> 02:11:45,200
But I would prefer to you to stay.

1537
02:11:45,200 --> 02:11:47,200
And that goes for everyone, don't leave me.

1538
02:11:47,200 --> 02:11:49,200
Or I will cry.

1539
02:11:55,200 --> 02:11:56,200
What?

1540
02:12:03,200 --> 02:12:05,200
Oh, Boomi, you're back.

1541
02:12:05,200 --> 02:12:06,200
Come on.

1542
02:12:08,200 --> 02:12:11,200
Aram is forever.

1543
02:12:12,200 --> 02:12:14,200
Yeah, you guys better not go nowhere.

1544
02:12:14,200 --> 02:12:16,200
Boomi will be very upset.

1545
02:12:16,200 --> 02:12:17,200
I'll stick Boomi on you.

1546
02:12:26,200 --> 02:12:30,200
Boomi, are you gonna keep sitting in front of my screen?

1547
02:12:31,200 --> 02:12:32,200
Alright.

1548
02:12:32,200 --> 02:12:33,200
I can't really...

1549
02:12:33,200 --> 02:12:36,200
He's sitting in front of my other one, so that's fine.

1550
02:12:36,200 --> 02:12:37,200
I thought there was a way down.

1551
02:12:37,200 --> 02:12:39,200
I'm like, oh, what's this?

1552
02:12:41,200 --> 02:12:43,200
I will enter when Boomi leaves the premises.

1553
02:12:43,200 --> 02:12:45,200
I did pat the cat.

1554
02:12:49,200 --> 02:12:53,200
I patted his head instead of petting it and he looked so goofy.

1555
02:12:53,200 --> 02:12:57,200
Don't me and IC's cats look so much alike?

1556
02:12:57,200 --> 02:12:59,200
Isn't that crazy?

1557
02:13:00,200 --> 02:13:02,200
Boomi looks so much like Lahage.

1558
02:13:03,200 --> 02:13:06,200
Or Bakaraj?

1559
02:13:06,200 --> 02:13:08,200
I can't remember his name.

1560
02:13:08,200 --> 02:13:11,200
They look so much alike except Boomi's lighter.

1561
02:13:12,200 --> 02:13:14,200
They literally look identical.

1562
02:13:18,200 --> 02:13:22,200
Boomi is laying on my computer keyboard.

1563
02:13:23,200 --> 02:13:24,200
Uh...

1564
02:13:31,200 --> 02:13:33,200
Thank you for getting off Boomi.

1565
02:13:35,200 --> 02:13:36,200
Do you want me to...

1566
02:13:36,200 --> 02:13:38,200
I just feel like you don't like this bed.

1567
02:13:38,200 --> 02:13:40,200
I'll just get it out of the way for you then.

1568
02:13:43,200 --> 02:13:45,200
Here, would you prefer this bed instead?

1569
02:13:45,200 --> 02:13:48,200
Or are you just gonna lay on the table?

1570
02:13:53,200 --> 02:13:56,200
Where are you going, sweet boy?

1571
02:13:59,200 --> 02:14:01,200
Madam, are you sweating?

1572
02:14:01,200 --> 02:14:02,200
Oh, I am.

1573
02:14:02,200 --> 02:14:05,200
Boomi was sitting on my...

1574
02:14:05,200 --> 02:14:08,200
my toggles.

1575
02:14:09,200 --> 02:14:12,200
I also just saved a screenshot when I was fixing that.

1576
02:14:18,200 --> 02:14:19,200
Here.

1577
02:14:20,200 --> 02:14:23,200
Here, do you want a bed?

1578
02:14:23,200 --> 02:14:26,200
There's a cozy bed for you.

1579
02:14:26,200 --> 02:14:28,200
I know you like this one more.

1580
02:14:32,200 --> 02:14:35,200
I will wait for you to get comfy before I start, Boomi.

1581
02:14:37,200 --> 02:14:40,200
He's like insisting on not stepping into the bed.

1582
02:14:43,200 --> 02:14:45,200
Okay, big man, where are you off to?

1583
02:14:46,200 --> 02:14:49,200
Pouch, pouch, pouch, pouch, pouch, pouch.

1584
02:14:49,200 --> 02:14:50,200
Are you gonna hop down?

1585
02:14:50,200 --> 02:14:52,200
Let me move out of the way.

1586
02:14:52,200 --> 02:14:54,200
No, no, he spotted my headphones.

1587
02:14:54,200 --> 02:14:55,200
Crap.

1588
02:14:56,200 --> 02:14:58,200
Ugh, you're getting heavy.

1589
02:15:02,200 --> 02:15:04,200
Boomi doesn't mind being held though.

1590
02:15:05,200 --> 02:15:07,200
He's like being picked up.

1591
02:15:07,200 --> 02:15:09,200
Cause he's up on my boy.

1592
02:15:10,200 --> 02:15:12,200
Where are you going?

1593
02:15:13,200 --> 02:15:16,200
Boomi, you can't just stand in front of my screen.

1594
02:15:16,200 --> 02:15:18,200
I think he hears a dog and he's like,

1595
02:15:18,200 --> 02:15:19,200
what's going on here?

1596
02:15:19,200 --> 02:15:21,200
What's this dog doing?

1597
02:15:21,200 --> 02:15:23,200
Why are you so mad?

1598
02:15:23,200 --> 02:15:24,200
He's flicking his tail.

1599
02:15:24,200 --> 02:15:27,200
Do you hear the dog and it's bothering you?

1600
02:15:27,200 --> 02:15:28,200
What's up?

1601
02:15:30,200 --> 02:15:31,200
What's up?

1602
02:15:33,200 --> 02:15:36,200
Okay, you can hang out right there, I suppose.

1603
02:15:37,200 --> 02:15:40,200
It's heavy, that's why he's mad.

1604
02:15:40,200 --> 02:15:43,200
I didn't say he was fat, I said he was heavy.

1605
02:15:43,200 --> 02:15:46,200
He's a very muscular, large cat.

1606
02:15:47,200 --> 02:15:49,200
He is, I've never had a boy cat

1607
02:15:49,200 --> 02:15:51,200
and I didn't realize how big they are.

1608
02:15:59,200 --> 02:16:01,200
My mom's never let me have a boy cat

1609
02:16:01,200 --> 02:16:03,200
because she said he would just be a cat.

1610
02:16:03,200 --> 02:16:06,200
But he doesn't even do, he doesn't walk or anything.

1611
02:16:06,200 --> 02:16:08,200
Oh no, Boomi, I can't see.

1612
02:16:08,200 --> 02:16:10,200
I can't see, I can't, I can't see.

1613
02:16:13,200 --> 02:16:17,200
Boomi's not the time to play with my boards.

1614
02:16:28,200 --> 02:16:31,200
I desperately need to get out of here.

1615
02:16:33,200 --> 02:16:35,200
Do you need help?

1616
02:16:35,200 --> 02:16:36,200
What the heck?

1617
02:16:36,200 --> 02:16:38,200
How did I dash all the way over there?

1618
02:16:45,200 --> 02:16:46,200
Health?

1619
02:16:47,200 --> 02:16:48,200
Great.

1620
02:16:48,200 --> 02:16:50,200
Seven health and a dream.

1621
02:16:50,200 --> 02:16:52,200
Boomi, where are you going?

1622
02:16:54,200 --> 02:16:56,200
Okay, thank you.

1623
02:16:58,200 --> 02:17:00,200
Are you getting in that bed?

1624
02:17:00,200 --> 02:17:03,200
I have like five, I just bought Boomi a new cat bed too.

1625
02:17:03,200 --> 02:17:06,200
I bought a cat bed and a toy just for Boomi

1626
02:17:06,200 --> 02:17:08,200
and he doesn't even play with the toy.

1627
02:17:09,200 --> 02:17:12,200
I got him one of those like scratching boards

1628
02:17:14,200 --> 02:17:18,200
that's also like, has a little ball aside

1629
02:17:18,200 --> 02:17:21,200
so you can like, the cat can like sit on the scratch board

1630
02:17:21,200 --> 02:17:24,200
and like bat the ball in a circle, it's like one of those.

1631
02:17:24,200 --> 02:17:26,200
And then, but he loves the new bed.

1632
02:17:27,200 --> 02:17:28,200
Excuse me.

1633
02:17:29,200 --> 02:17:32,200
Mama puts a no male collapse cat suit.

1634
02:17:33,200 --> 02:17:34,200
Have a good night.

1635
02:17:34,200 --> 02:17:36,200
Thanks for stopping by.

1636
02:17:36,200 --> 02:17:37,200
Boomi's expensive.

1637
02:17:37,200 --> 02:17:39,200
I like, I like, like if you come into my house

1638
02:17:39,200 --> 02:17:41,200
it'll be like, wow cats definitely live here

1639
02:17:41,200 --> 02:17:43,200
because I love spoiling my cats

1640
02:17:43,200 --> 02:17:45,200
and getting them lots of nice things.

1641
02:17:47,200 --> 02:17:49,200
A fountain chamber.

1642
02:17:50,200 --> 02:17:54,200
I would love to see what it's trying to tell me

1643
02:17:54,200 --> 02:17:56,200
if I could walk over there.

1644
02:18:03,200 --> 02:18:05,200
A place of calm and respite

1645
02:18:05,200 --> 02:18:08,200
whilst perhaps unimaginable in the underworld

1646
02:18:08,200 --> 02:18:11,200
occasionally is to be found, in fact.

1647
02:18:12,200 --> 02:18:13,200
And not a moment too soon.

1648
02:18:13,200 --> 02:18:16,200
Yeah, I was freaking dying, bro.

1649
02:18:17,200 --> 02:18:19,200
Can I get like more?

1650
02:18:19,200 --> 02:18:22,200
I like how there's just like little ghosts

1651
02:18:22,200 --> 02:18:24,200
just chilling in it, like yeah.

1652
02:18:27,200 --> 02:18:29,200
I might go to Charon

1653
02:18:30,200 --> 02:18:34,200
just because I know I can buy another boon off of him.

1654
02:18:34,200 --> 02:18:36,200
Sounds like Charon's breathing up ahead.

1655
02:18:36,200 --> 02:18:37,200
Charon, sorry.

1656
02:18:38,200 --> 02:18:39,200
Um...

1657
02:18:42,200 --> 02:18:43,200
I can still...

1658
02:18:45,200 --> 02:18:46,200
Can get that.

1659
02:18:46,200 --> 02:18:49,200
And then I will buy something from Aries.

1660
02:18:51,200 --> 02:18:52,200
Oh.

1661
02:18:54,200 --> 02:18:55,200
Rick.

1662
02:18:57,200 --> 02:18:58,200
What?

1663
02:18:58,200 --> 02:19:00,200
Oh, I thought it said...

1664
02:19:00,200 --> 02:19:02,200
I totally read that wrong.

1665
02:19:02,200 --> 02:19:04,200
I'm so pissed.

1666
02:19:05,200 --> 02:19:08,200
I thought it said that I would get...

1667
02:19:10,200 --> 02:19:12,200
It would cost a 20.

1668
02:19:16,200 --> 02:19:18,200
But it said it'd restore 20 health.

1669
02:19:18,200 --> 02:19:20,200
I feel really dumb.

1670
02:19:23,200 --> 02:19:24,200
Ugh.

1671
02:19:24,200 --> 02:19:27,200
I am very mad at myself, but what can you do?

1672
02:19:27,200 --> 02:19:28,200
What can you do?

1673
02:19:28,200 --> 02:19:31,200
Because I'm like, oh, okay, I have enough for both.

1674
02:19:31,200 --> 02:19:32,200
I didn't.

1675
02:19:32,200 --> 02:19:34,200
I should have done that first.

1676
02:19:37,200 --> 02:19:39,200
I wish I had the chain.

1677
02:19:39,200 --> 02:19:41,200
The chain would be really good right now.

1678
02:19:54,200 --> 02:19:55,200
Get poisoned.

1679
02:19:55,200 --> 02:19:56,200
Ow.

1680
02:19:56,200 --> 02:19:58,200
Sometimes I feel like things should do way more damage

1681
02:19:58,200 --> 02:19:59,200
than they should.

1682
02:19:59,200 --> 02:20:02,200
Get poisoned, get poisoned, get poisoned, get poisoned.

1683
02:20:06,200 --> 02:20:07,200
Where's the...

1684
02:20:08,200 --> 02:20:10,200
Where's the stupid little...

1685
02:20:13,200 --> 02:20:17,200
There's not even like the little pile of skulls.

1686
02:20:17,200 --> 02:20:19,200
Why are they spawning so much?

1687
02:20:24,200 --> 02:20:25,200
Holy crap.

1688
02:20:30,200 --> 02:20:31,200
Damn.

1689
02:20:46,200 --> 02:20:48,200
Yeah, I was thinking that.

1690
02:20:56,200 --> 02:20:57,200
That's hard.

1691
02:21:00,200 --> 02:21:02,200
Because these are all actually super helpful.

1692
02:21:06,200 --> 02:21:07,200
I'm debating whether or not...

1693
02:21:07,200 --> 02:21:09,200
Because I've only seen a...

1694
02:21:09,200 --> 02:21:12,200
There hasn't been too many armored people.

1695
02:21:18,200 --> 02:21:19,200
I'll do...

1696
02:21:19,200 --> 02:21:20,200
Yeah, armor is annoying.

1697
02:21:20,200 --> 02:21:21,200
Let's do that.

1698
02:21:22,200 --> 02:21:23,200
I'll do...

1699
02:21:23,200 --> 02:21:24,200
Don't get it.

1700
02:21:24,200 --> 02:21:25,200
I'll do...

1701
02:21:30,200 --> 02:21:31,200
Yeah, let's first.

1702
02:21:40,200 --> 02:21:42,200
I didn't think you'd be able to reach me.

1703
02:21:52,200 --> 02:21:56,200
Get poisoned, get poisoned, get poisoned, get poisoned, get poisoned.

1704
02:22:00,200 --> 02:22:03,200
Oh, why are there so many of you?

1705
02:22:09,200 --> 02:22:11,200
Okay, the poison helps a lot, actually.

1706
02:22:12,200 --> 02:22:13,200
Nice.

1707
02:22:16,200 --> 02:22:17,200
Let's go see Sharon again,

1708
02:22:17,200 --> 02:22:18,200
because now I have more.

1709
02:22:21,200 --> 02:22:22,200
Hi.

1710
02:22:23,200 --> 02:22:24,200
Ooh.

1711
02:22:24,200 --> 02:22:25,200
Cool.

1712
02:22:28,200 --> 02:22:29,200
What is this?

1713
02:22:31,200 --> 02:22:32,200
My question?

1714
02:22:45,200 --> 02:22:46,200
Random boom.

1715
02:22:46,200 --> 02:22:47,200
Boom.

1716
02:22:53,200 --> 02:22:55,200
Oh, deal more damage,

1717
02:22:55,200 --> 02:22:58,200
but that's like 10%, but that's like 15%.

1718
02:23:03,200 --> 02:23:05,200
I don't really have anything on my...

1719
02:23:07,200 --> 02:23:09,200
Yeah, I'm gonna do the cast,

1720
02:23:09,200 --> 02:23:11,200
because I don't have anything on my cast.

1721
02:23:16,200 --> 02:23:28,200
Which one should I improve with the Hall of Power?

1722
02:23:40,200 --> 02:23:42,200
Yeah, I was thinking that,

1723
02:23:42,200 --> 02:23:44,200
because I use my special a lot.

1724
02:23:46,200 --> 02:23:47,200
Yeah, okay.

1725
02:23:51,200 --> 02:23:52,200
I'll pay for that.

1726
02:23:54,200 --> 02:23:56,200
That's pretty cool of you, Sharon.

1727
02:23:56,200 --> 02:23:59,200
I guess money does help sometimes.

1728
02:23:59,200 --> 02:24:00,200
Okay.

1729
02:24:15,200 --> 02:24:17,200
Maybe I could just spam dash on her.

1730
02:24:22,200 --> 02:24:24,200
You can't stop thinking about me.

1731
02:24:24,200 --> 02:24:25,200
Ooh.

1732
02:24:25,200 --> 02:24:26,200
You think of me in pain?

1733
02:24:26,200 --> 02:24:28,200
Oh my God, she's literally me for real.

1734
02:24:29,200 --> 02:24:30,200
Oh, nope.

1735
02:24:30,200 --> 02:24:31,200
I'm not gonna press start,

1736
02:24:31,200 --> 02:24:33,200
because Reyna's thinking of jumping on my desk right now.

1737
02:24:33,200 --> 02:24:34,200
Hi, Reyna.

1738
02:24:34,200 --> 02:24:35,200
What's up?

1739
02:24:37,200 --> 02:24:40,200
I'm gonna need you to skedaddle, sweetie.

1740
02:24:41,200 --> 02:24:42,200
Reyna.

1741
02:24:42,200 --> 02:24:44,200
Okay, come say hi.

1742
02:24:44,200 --> 02:24:45,200

1743
02:24:51,200 --> 02:24:52,200
Hi.

1744
02:24:52,200 --> 02:24:53,200
Hi, Reyna.

1745
02:24:54,200 --> 02:24:55,200
Oh, you wanna hug too?

1746
02:24:55,200 --> 02:24:56,200
Okay.

1747
02:25:00,200 --> 02:25:01,200
Hug time.

1748
02:25:02,200 --> 02:25:04,200
Is that too loud, by the way?

1749
02:25:16,200 --> 02:25:17,200
It's not too loud.

1750
02:25:17,200 --> 02:25:19,200
Okay, you can hear me fine, though.

1751
02:25:22,200 --> 02:25:23,200
Okay, cool.

1752
02:25:24,200 --> 02:25:27,200
Reyna is burning in my arms.

1753
02:25:29,200 --> 02:25:32,200
And as usual, pulling my headphones out of my way.

1754
02:25:46,200 --> 02:25:48,200
Sorry, I'm just chilling in the petting cat.

1755
02:25:49,200 --> 02:25:50,200
Reyna.

1756
02:25:50,200 --> 02:25:52,200
I'll be more and be more specific.

1757
02:26:10,200 --> 02:26:11,200
I'm really sorry.

1758
02:26:11,200 --> 02:26:14,200
I'm just like disassociating while I'm petting Reyna.

1759
02:26:21,200 --> 02:26:24,200
Oh, I'm trying to put her on down,

1760
02:26:24,200 --> 02:26:27,200
and she's like holding onto my shoulder.

1761
02:26:42,200 --> 02:26:44,200
How are you guys doing?

1762
02:26:44,200 --> 02:26:46,200
I'm doing okay.

1763
02:26:51,200 --> 02:26:54,200
I'm thinking about what I'm gonna make for dinner.

1764
02:26:58,200 --> 02:27:00,200
I'm just chilling, yeah.

1765
02:27:01,200 --> 02:27:02,200
Rushing Reyna.

1766
02:27:07,200 --> 02:27:09,200
Me holding you, you purring in my arms.

1767
02:27:15,200 --> 02:27:17,200
What are choices for dinner?

1768
02:27:18,200 --> 02:27:23,200
I made myself for lunch salmon and rice,

1769
02:27:24,200 --> 02:27:26,200
and I don't know what I'm gonna make for dinner

1770
02:27:26,200 --> 02:27:28,200
because I don't want salmon and rice again.

1771
02:27:32,200 --> 02:27:35,200
Yeah, I definitely should go grocery shopping again.

1772
02:27:36,200 --> 02:27:38,200
This is salmon out for 24 hours?

1773
02:27:38,200 --> 02:27:39,200
No, it wasn't.

1774
02:27:56,200 --> 02:27:58,200
Wait, my cheek is the wrong color.

1775
02:27:58,200 --> 02:27:59,200
Why is that?

1776
02:27:59,200 --> 02:28:00,200
Got soup?

1777
02:28:02,200 --> 02:28:03,200
Do I have soup?

1778
02:28:04,200 --> 02:28:05,200
No, I don't have any soup.

1779
02:28:08,200 --> 02:28:09,200
I finished the stew.

1780
02:28:14,200 --> 02:28:16,200
I'm just thinking she has only one wing.

1781
02:28:16,200 --> 02:28:17,200
How does she fly?

1782
02:28:17,200 --> 02:28:21,200
The soup is salmon running away in water,

1783
02:28:21,200 --> 02:28:22,200
that's what I'll say.

1784
02:28:25,200 --> 02:28:26,200
Water and flour.

1785
02:28:28,200 --> 02:28:29,200
For dinner?

1786
02:28:32,200 --> 02:28:33,200
Girl.

1787
02:28:34,200 --> 02:28:36,200
I don't know how to make it.

1788
02:28:41,200 --> 02:28:42,200
I didn't know that.

1789
02:28:42,200 --> 02:28:43,200
I can make it.

1790
02:28:43,200 --> 02:28:45,200

1791
02:28:46,720 --> 02:28:51,000
Girl dinner indeed some eggs. I don't like I don't like eating eggs

1792

Like I'll eat eggs, but they're not my first choice or anything. I

1793
02:28:56,400 --> 02:28:58,400
Don't know why I

1795
02:29:05,200 --> 02:29:09,040
I don't know why I just don't like eggs anymore like I'll still eat anything with eggs in it, but

Do I have frozen shrimp, I don't think I do I think I only have frozen salmon

Actually, I could make spaghetti because I have pasta. I have pasta sauce. I have meatballs

1801
02:29:39,080 --> 02:29:42,940
I also have sausages, but I would have to defrost those

1898
02:41:56,660 --> 02:41:58,660

Can you move please can you not chew on boomie's trying to take my

1904
02:42:24,980 --> 02:42:26,980

1905
02:42:32,420 --> 02:42:34,420
He just freaking

1906
02:42:34,580 --> 02:42:39,060
Grab my headphone wire in his mouth and I knew what was coming because that's when I

1907
02:42:39,140 --> 02:42:43,140
He has his like posture when he's gonna jump off like he's gonna take something and run off with it

1908
02:42:43,700 --> 02:42:45,060
and so he just

1909
02:42:45,060 --> 02:42:49,460
Grabbed my headphones and jumped down and ripped my headphones out of my ears

1910
02:42:50,180 --> 02:42:57,300
Because he was trying to make off with them. I'm telling you this man is a menace. He's a villain. He just tried to steal from me

1911
02:43:00,740 --> 02:43:06,340
He just yoinked my headphones out of my ears because he was trying and he almost unplugged me. Did he unplug them?

1912
02:43:07,460 --> 02:43:12,100
No, he didn't but he'll do that with his toy like I'll I'll be playing with him with the toy like a um

1913
02:43:13,220 --> 02:43:16,660
Like a like a little like feather wand and then he'll just like grab

1914
02:43:17,140 --> 02:43:21,460
The end of the toy yank it out of my hands and run away with it. I'm like, that's not how this is played

1915
02:43:23,220 --> 02:43:25,220
He thought they were dangerous

1916
02:43:28,500 --> 02:43:30,500
He just wants attention

1917
02:43:34,180 --> 02:43:40,900
Oh, yeah, oh, oh no, I'm very close to death. Oh, at least I can just unlock you

1918
02:43:43,300 --> 02:43:45,300
I'm so slow

1919
02:43:47,460 --> 02:43:49,460
Oh

1920
02:44:01,140 --> 02:44:03,940
You can't get me you can't get me

1921
02:44:10,260 --> 02:44:13,540
Oh, I'm so slow I live 26

1922
02:44:14,500 --> 02:44:17,700
Oh, maybe I can get some health. Let's see

1923
02:44:21,940 --> 02:44:23,940
Someone to spend some coin

1924
02:44:24,740 --> 02:44:26,740
It's also just a nice reprieve

1925
02:44:28,180 --> 02:44:30,180
No, all right

1926
02:44:30,660 --> 02:44:36,420
Hey, what's up Sharon? You are a cypher sore eyes. They're cairon. Sorry cairon cairin

1927
02:44:40,100 --> 02:44:42,100
Brilliant okay, I have more money

1928
02:44:42,340 --> 02:44:44,340
No

1929
02:44:47,220 --> 02:44:49,220
Sharon

1930
02:44:50,100 --> 02:44:52,100
Yeah, I know I love this game

1931
02:44:54,660 --> 02:45:00,340
He appeared thunder he just tried to what do mean justice for boomi. He just tried to steal from me

1932
02:45:02,180 --> 02:45:04,820
Now he's sitting on the cat tree like he didn't do anything

1933
02:45:07,860 --> 02:45:10,900
Oh, this is great. Wait, did I get the 400 armor? I don't even remember

1934
02:45:13,060 --> 02:45:15,060
Oh

1935
02:45:28,580 --> 02:45:34,980
Okay, that's fine that was it sucks because I forgot to put on death defiance, but I kind of stopped taking it seriously after that

1936
02:45:35,780 --> 02:45:37,780
Oh

1937
02:45:38,820 --> 02:45:40,820
Damn giant evil crystal

1938
02:45:41,940 --> 02:45:43,940
Damn giant evil crystal

1939
02:45:44,820 --> 02:45:52,180
Uh, what do you want? Oh, hi. I'm welcome home again. Go right ahead. What did my dad do?

1940
02:45:54,340 --> 02:45:56,340
Joy

1941
02:45:57,700 --> 02:45:59,860
Something leaking from the room

1942
02:46:00,260 --> 02:46:05,460
You're getting somewhere with that codex lad. I'm pleased to see it

1943
02:46:06,340 --> 02:46:10,980
My duties to the house. I'll try to travel for the boat. Sorry. I read fast

1944
02:46:14,420 --> 02:46:17,700
Hades themed ASMR. What could I possibly do?

1945
02:46:18,740 --> 02:46:20,420
For that

1946
02:46:20,420 --> 02:46:24,660
Oh, I just died. Oh, I'm back. Oh, here's my run. Who is that?

1947
02:46:25,620 --> 02:46:29,220
Thanatos featured servant of the house. Oh

1948
02:46:31,940 --> 02:46:33,940
Have I seen Thanatos?

1949
02:46:37,860 --> 02:46:39,860
Beating the listener to death

1950
02:46:40,500 --> 02:46:44,420
Role play nix because role play meg. Oh, that's a good point. Oh wait mom

1951
02:46:46,100 --> 02:46:48,100
My mother because you raised me

1952
02:46:49,060 --> 02:46:53,140
Next do you know anything about a softly spoken gentle being under the guise of chaos?

1953
02:46:53,780 --> 02:46:56,180
They approached me recently and offered me a boon of sorts

1954
02:46:57,540 --> 02:46:59,540
Primordial chaos

1955
02:47:00,100 --> 02:47:02,100
Indeed, I know them well

1956
02:47:02,660 --> 02:47:04,660
They must have taken interest in your quest

1957
02:47:06,100 --> 02:47:11,380
I understand. What is this freaking ghost cheesing next to me about? Did you see he's just like

1958
02:47:12,500 --> 02:47:16,100
It ran off. What is funny ms. Dusa did I?

1959
02:47:18,260 --> 02:47:23,220
I don't have any nectars. I give her one. Do I have can I like exchange something?

1960
02:47:25,860 --> 02:47:27,860
Five for a nectar

1961
02:47:31,780 --> 02:47:35,540
I would have given her one, but no do so where'd you go?

1962
02:47:37,300 --> 02:47:41,140
My blind were do so go. Usually she's so so so around. Oh, there she is

1963
02:47:48,580 --> 02:47:50,580
Oh, she didn't run away that time

1964
02:47:58,660 --> 02:48:00,660
Nix's offspring of chaos

1965
02:48:01,220 --> 02:48:02,820
Hey

1966
02:48:02,820 --> 02:48:06,260
I need to neck to her. I didn't get any shadow stuff

1967
02:48:07,060 --> 02:48:09,060
So I'm not even gonna bother with that

1968
02:48:09,460 --> 02:48:11,460
Wait, no, I do need to bother with that

1969
02:48:14,340 --> 02:48:16,340
Just need to fix that

1970
02:48:18,260 --> 02:48:20,260
You

1971
02:48:29,700 --> 02:48:31,700
Cut nectar cut nectar

1972
02:48:32,180 --> 02:48:34,180
Um

1973
02:48:34,180 --> 02:48:38,900
Plop plop plop get nectar get nectar. They don't even pay me to do it. I'm gonna start calling it nectar

1974
02:48:44,820 --> 02:48:46,820
Okay

1975
02:48:48,900 --> 02:48:50,900
You ready

1976
02:48:53,140 --> 02:48:56,500
Time you learn the bearing of the gods and to assert yourself

1977
02:48:57,380 --> 02:49:02,740
For this I have employed what does this mean? What does bearing mean or what became of him? What?

1978
02:49:04,820 --> 02:49:06,820
What

1979
02:49:07,620 --> 02:49:09,620
This one's for you Achilles

1980
02:49:11,540 --> 02:49:13,540
Oh, what

1981
02:49:13,700 --> 02:49:17,780
Is this supposed to be a nod to asbestos

1982
02:49:25,140 --> 02:49:29,460
Bearing as a word he used in his sentence wow

1983
02:49:35,540 --> 02:49:37,540
That's it

1984
02:49:43,700 --> 02:49:45,860
What I can go to chaos off the rip. Yeah

1985
02:49:48,020 --> 02:49:50,020
Fucking I will

1986
02:49:52,340 --> 02:49:58,980
Oh Daedalus is hammer. I'm so dumb. Listen. I'm tired. I just hit me

1987
02:50:03,700 --> 02:50:06,740
That makes sense because nix has the same skulls on her body

1988
02:50:10,580 --> 02:50:12,580
Thank you

1989
02:50:13,540 --> 02:50:15,540
Oh

1990
02:50:25,460 --> 02:50:27,460
Thank you, I just won't cast

1991
02:50:31,860 --> 02:50:33,860
I probably should have looked at the little thingy

1992
02:50:43,860 --> 02:50:45,860
Okay

1993
02:50:54,020 --> 02:50:56,020
All right, I'll talk to Artemis

1994
02:50:59,460 --> 02:51:01,460
Pog

1995
02:51:02,340 --> 02:51:04,340
Oh

1996
02:51:09,860 --> 02:51:13,860
What oh, no, I didn't mean to press that

1997
02:51:15,700 --> 02:51:20,260
That was so weird. It just didn't do anything. It didn't do the attack

1998
02:51:20,980 --> 02:51:24,820
I was pressing square like what the frick. I'm so thrown off now

1999
02:51:26,340 --> 02:51:28,900
That was so weird. Is this the run? I don't know

2000
02:51:31,700 --> 02:51:33,700
I

2001
02:51:37,860 --> 02:51:41,460
Can literally just boost the crap out of my special

2002
02:52:01,460 --> 02:52:03,460
Oh

2003
02:52:08,900 --> 02:52:10,900
A curse of chaos has been lifted

2004
02:52:19,380 --> 02:52:21,380
Worth it

2005
02:52:22,580 --> 02:52:26,740
Can I please get like boons for health

2006
02:52:26,740 --> 02:52:31,140
The special is crazy on this run

2007
02:52:33,700 --> 02:52:35,700
Let's check it

2008
02:52:38,180 --> 02:52:40,180
Whoa

2009
02:52:41,940 --> 02:52:43,940
Oh my god

2010
02:52:46,340 --> 02:52:49,620
It took a while. All right, let's just

2011
02:52:50,500 --> 02:52:55,860
That was not as effective as I thought it would be

2012
02:52:57,540 --> 02:53:01,780
However that this would be good for the armor thing

2013
02:53:08,820 --> 02:53:10,820
Another key

2014
02:53:14,500 --> 02:53:16,500
Hmm

2015
02:53:17,060 --> 02:53:22,260
I kind of want to be able to inflict hangover for the quick dash. I prefer it rather than

2016
02:53:23,060 --> 02:53:26,260
Whatever his thing is to be honest with you. So I might go with him

2017
02:53:32,980 --> 02:53:38,340
Yeah, they're both boss chambers so no matter which one I do I'll probably face the jewels again

2018
02:53:38,580 --> 02:53:45,380
You think Aries dash is better

2019
02:53:50,340 --> 02:53:53,780
That's true. Okay, I'll do areas

2020
02:54:02,100 --> 02:54:04,500
Oh, oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god

2021
02:54:08,340 --> 02:54:10,340
Oh

2022
02:54:11,860 --> 02:54:20,180
I'm fucking this up. I'm I'm fucking it up. Oh, oh my god. Oh my why am I stuck here?

2023
02:54:28,180 --> 02:54:30,180
Ah

2024
02:54:33,380 --> 02:54:36,020
Why do I feel like my special is not doing as much to okay, there we go

2025
02:54:36,980 --> 02:54:38,980
I'm like, what's happening here?

2026
02:54:43,860 --> 02:54:45,860
Yeah, I'm a death dealer Harry Potter

2027
02:54:52,340 --> 02:54:56,500
And it doesn't even have the dash there's not even the dash here

2028
02:54:57,220 --> 02:55:06,500
Because they already used death defying so am I gonna get more bonus damage?

2029
02:55:13,700 --> 02:55:15,700
You say one, all right, let's do one

2030
02:55:15,780 --> 02:55:17,780
The will to fight

2031
02:55:25,220 --> 02:55:27,620
Oh three only works for the room you're in that makes sense

2032
02:55:35,060 --> 02:55:37,060
What does the doom effect do

2033
02:55:46,100 --> 02:55:52,100
Let's go see Sisyphus

2034
02:55:56,660 --> 02:56:04,740
Okay, interesting. Hi. She has been giving me a time. I wish she would let me pass

2035
02:56:10,820 --> 02:56:14,820
She is made the cover. Oh sweet. I can finally get a nectar. I'm surprised I hadn't been getting any nectar drops

2036
02:56:16,420 --> 02:56:18,420
I

2037
02:56:29,620 --> 02:56:31,860
Guys are so spread out. I can't do my chain attack

2038
02:56:34,900 --> 02:56:36,900
There you go

2039
02:56:41,220 --> 02:56:43,220
But I'm pointing this way

2040
02:56:46,420 --> 02:56:53,380
Oh, this is like nasty. This is one shot. What why are they still coming?

2041
02:56:56,660 --> 02:56:58,660
Okay, that was just like wacky

2042
02:57:01,460 --> 02:57:05,060
Oh, you're giving me a palm. Okay. What we got here

2043
02:57:05,060 --> 02:57:07,060
That time to be a little short of coin

2044
02:57:14,180 --> 02:57:18,420
Hmm, I could do that I'm gonna save my money

2045
02:57:28,100 --> 02:57:32,420
Oh my god, my special is insane now my special I can even talk

2046
02:57:36,020 --> 02:57:38,020
Hmm

2047
02:57:50,260 --> 02:57:52,900
Oh my god, my special is off the chisane. What the

2048
02:57:54,260 --> 02:57:56,660
I'm like, I see him coming for me. What's happening here?

2049
02:58:00,180 --> 02:58:02,180
Oh my god

2050
02:58:03,060 --> 02:58:05,060
No, I'm uh

2051
02:58:12,580 --> 02:58:14,580
More power

2052
02:58:16,500 --> 02:58:18,980
Um, let's get more of this

2053
02:58:27,140 --> 02:58:29,140
Oh

2054
02:58:32,900 --> 02:58:37,460
Oh chaos hi

2055
02:58:43,060 --> 02:58:48,580
That's nasty chaos, what's up? Oh, I can give you a gift. You know, I'm gonna give chaos a gift

2056
02:58:49,060 --> 02:58:51,060
Because I bet they have a crazy thing

2057
02:58:56,180 --> 02:58:58,180
Because you've been a real one

2058
02:58:58,180 --> 02:59:00,180
It tends to tend to be the interior

2059
02:59:00,500 --> 02:59:03,460
Oh, okay. I'm sorry. You're too cool for that

2060
02:59:04,820 --> 02:59:07,880
That is chaotic. They're like, this is stupid here. I'll give you something in return

2061
02:59:12,580 --> 02:59:14,580
Cosmic egg

2062
02:59:24,980 --> 02:59:26,980

03:12:42,340 --> 03:12:44,340
This is that's her uh

2154
03:12:44,340 --> 03:12:46,340

2158
03:13:06,340 --> 03:13:08,340

2159
03:13:11,620 --> 03:13:13,620
She's just a little baby

2160
03:13:16,900 --> 03:13:18,900
Girl you're going too fast I can't keep up

2161
03:13:22,340 --> 03:13:27,060
She's still not on solid solid food yet, so I puree everything for her

2162
03:13:27,380 --> 03:13:33,380
Um, but sometimes she'll have the strength to like chew on some kibble, which is a very good sign

2163
03:13:36,660 --> 03:13:41,540
Can you guys hear going the life bad companion?

2164
03:13:47,620 --> 03:13:51,140
Boomi go away. He's trying to steal her food

2165
03:13:54,500 --> 03:13:56,500

2172
03:14:46,580 --> 03:14:49,780
Can you hear going that's her sucking on the syringe

2173
03:14:49,780 --> 03:14:51,780
She's like a little baby

2174
03:14:58,980 --> 03:15:00,980
Good girl

2175
03:15:05,220 --> 03:15:07,220
I'll give you some treats afterwards too

2176
03:15:11,860 --> 03:15:17,460
Boomi's just making sure she's okay if you could see him he's desperately trying to get to the syringe so he can drink from it

2177
03:15:20,740 --> 03:15:23,460
Yeah defend that boomi's lawyer defend that

2178
03:15:32,260 --> 03:15:35,060

Boomi boomi

03:15:39,860 --> 03:15:41,860
Yeah, that's what I thought

2181
03:15:42,420 --> 03:15:44,420
Making sure it's not poisoned

2182
03:15:45,060 --> 03:15:47,060
No video evidence

2183
03:15:49,780 --> 03:15:51,780
I

2184
03:15:58,820 --> 03:16:04,100
Move the mic down so you guys can hear her she just heard you know, you know, baby

2185
03:16:11,140 --> 03:16:14,900
Sometimes the food gets stuck in the syringe and it actually like shoots out

2186
03:16:14,900 --> 03:16:22,260
I have to be careful not to like make it explode all over the place

2187
03:16:25,700 --> 03:16:27,700
There you go

2188
03:16:34,660 --> 03:16:37,540
I think my water finally finished boiling in the pot

2189
03:16:38,500 --> 03:16:42,660
But I've only fed Fia half the syringe so I'm gonna try to feed her the rest before I

2190
03:16:43,060 --> 03:16:45,140
I always eat feed her before I feed myself

2191
03:16:47,300 --> 03:16:49,300
Can you get your little baby?

2192
03:16:50,660 --> 03:16:53,140
And boomi's just sitting in front of my screen nothing there

2193
03:17:03,380 --> 03:17:08,020
This is a cat being fed by a syringe youtube nothing bad

2194
03:17:10,020 --> 03:17:12,020
And boomi's is watching

2195
03:17:13,620 --> 03:17:16,820
It's very disappointedly that he's not being fed like this

2196
03:17:21,140 --> 03:17:26,980
I have to feed my babies before I can continue stream Fia you got some in your nose

2197
03:17:28,900 --> 03:17:30,900
Good girl

2198
03:17:34,260 --> 03:17:39,060
Yes, I did name boomi after boomi king of umashu because he was such a crazy kitten

2199
03:17:43,300 --> 03:17:45,300
Are you surprised? I don't know. I just

2200
03:17:47,060 --> 03:17:49,060
Some people would give up on her

2201
03:17:49,540 --> 03:17:51,540
And I just can't do that. I'm gonna

2202
03:17:52,340 --> 03:17:54,340
Work hard for my little girl

2203
03:17:54,900 --> 03:17:56,900
She's just such a sweet soul

2204
03:17:57,940 --> 03:18:01,540
How could I not oh this piece does not want to come out

2205
03:18:03,540 --> 03:18:05,540
Here

2206
03:18:07,940 --> 03:18:09,940
Is there a piece that's stuck again

2207
03:18:10,900 --> 03:18:16,980
I don't want this just to explode boomi you can't have this

2208
03:18:20,820 --> 03:18:22,820
Eagle

2209
03:18:33,060 --> 03:18:38,180
Fia I'm sorry. There's like a piece stuck in the syringe. I have to get it out. There you go. Are you done?

2210
03:18:39,940 --> 03:18:41,940
No, okay

2211
03:18:45,300 --> 03:18:50,580
Your sister's he is staring so intensely. Hi boomi at the

2212
03:18:52,100 --> 03:18:56,180
The the thing at the syringe because he wants them so bad

2213
03:18:57,380 --> 03:19:02,340
I mean, I'm preparing the food boomi will steal from it. He's licked half the bowl clean when I walked away before

2214
03:19:03,060 --> 03:19:05,060
And I was like no that was for your sister

2215
03:19:06,500 --> 03:19:08,500
Oh my god, this won't come out

2216
03:19:09,460 --> 03:19:15,940
I don't want to have to use my mouth on it because this is like duck

2217
03:19:23,220 --> 03:19:25,220
I can't get it out

2218
03:19:26,980 --> 03:19:28,980
Gross

2219
03:19:32,900 --> 03:19:34,900
Trying to suck it out and I can't

2220
03:19:35,700 --> 03:19:38,580
Boomi does want the fancy food

2221
03:19:40,260 --> 03:19:42,260
Fia, I'm sorry baby girl

2222
03:19:42,820 --> 03:19:47,460
It's like a giant piece of food stuck in the syringe and I don't want to explode everywhere and I'm trying to squeeze it out

2223
03:19:47,460 --> 03:19:49,460
But it's not working

2224
03:20:01,220 --> 03:20:04,580
She's like waiting patiently like mother where's the rest

2225
03:20:05,620 --> 03:20:07,620
You

2226
03:20:11,780 --> 03:20:16,900
And it's funny because I always give boomi a little bit when I'm preparing her food, but then he just wants to take it all

2227
03:20:20,100 --> 03:20:22,100
There's no

2228
03:20:22,180 --> 03:20:26,020
If they do fine, it's not like they're taking a lot from me anyways. Oh

2229
03:20:27,220 --> 03:20:29,700
Did I just score it out? I just don't want to shoot at my computer

2230
03:20:32,180 --> 03:20:34,180
There you go

2231
03:20:34,500 --> 03:20:39,140
Yeah, it's back to normal. Nope. Sorry just bonked you on the nose

2232
03:20:44,980 --> 03:20:48,900
Uh actually, nope, it's not back to normal

03:20:48,900 --> 03:20:50,900
Oh

2234
03:21:00,660 --> 03:21:07,860
It just squirted everywhere no fia I got it on your face and I got it over my arm

2235
03:21:14,020 --> 03:21:17,620
I have to wipe your face after this you're no messy baby

2236
03:21:18,900 --> 03:21:20,900
I

2237
03:21:21,140 --> 03:21:23,140
Hear boomi you want some of that?

2238
03:21:28,820 --> 03:21:31,140
Boomi's licking my hands. Thank you actually

2239
03:21:39,780 --> 03:21:41,780
Cat eating food ASMR

2240
03:21:48,900 --> 03:21:50,900
I

2241
03:22:13,060 --> 03:22:15,060
That's the first like a dictator

2242
03:22:15,060 --> 03:22:22,060
Sorry for you. Let me wipe your face because you got some of the food on your face, you little girl.

2243
03:22:22,060 --> 03:22:30,060
You're so good. Even when Boomi's trying to steal everything. Here, you can have the last of it.

2244
03:22:30,060 --> 03:22:39,060
Good girl. Good girl.

2245
03:22:39,060 --> 03:22:45,060
Boomi just tripped on my desk and it was funny.

2246
03:22:46,060 --> 03:22:51,060
Okay.

2247
03:22:51,060 --> 03:22:55,060
Fia, you ate that pretty fast.

2248
03:22:55,060 --> 03:22:59,060
Why are you growling?

2249
03:22:59,060 --> 03:23:03,060
Just wiping your face.

2250
03:23:03,060 --> 03:23:08,060
Is it because Boomi's taking your food?

2251
03:23:08,060 --> 03:23:11,060
She's like not happy.

2252
03:23:11,060 --> 03:23:17,060
Yeah, I know. I need to burp you.

2253
03:23:17,060 --> 03:23:23,060
Yeah, that's Fia.

2254
03:23:23,060 --> 03:23:28,060
I have to co-podge you. Co-podge.

2255
03:23:28,060 --> 03:23:39,060
You don't want to, when you syringe feed any sort of animal, you want to even kind of make sure that it's a little bit thicker so their body differentiates so they don't asphyxiate on it.

2256
03:23:40,060 --> 03:23:46,060
So I usually will burp her afterwards.

2257
03:23:46,060 --> 03:23:54,060
No, it's in a teak kettle. I just boiled it in a teak kettle. It's fine.

2258
03:23:54,060 --> 03:24:02,060
It's also probably just uncomfortable to be held like a baby and then fed.

2259
03:24:02,060 --> 03:24:11,060
And it's hard for her to understand what's going on because I'm moving her around a lot.

2260
03:24:11,060 --> 03:24:19,060
She mostly will meow out of frustration because she can't move. She's like, eh, come on.

2261
03:24:19,060 --> 03:24:26,060
Good girl. Oh, you're so good.

2262
03:24:26,060 --> 03:24:31,060
How you burp a cat like a baby? Exactly.

2263
03:24:31,060 --> 03:24:34,060
I'm a hard-working mother.

2264
03:24:34,060 --> 03:24:39,060
Okay, yeah, you want to say bye to them?

2265
03:24:39,060 --> 03:24:42,060
Yeah.

2266
03:24:42,060 --> 03:24:45,060
There you go.

2267
03:24:46,060 --> 03:24:53,060
Good girl. Let me get you a wipe so I can wipe your face.

2268
03:25:05,060 --> 03:25:10,060
Why are you looking at me like that, Bowie?

2269
03:25:11,060 --> 03:25:21,060
I gave her a bath the other day and she looks so goofy.

2270
03:25:28,060 --> 03:25:31,060
She looks like you so so.

2271
03:25:31,060 --> 03:25:35,060
She looks like one of those cats in those commercials.

2272
03:25:35,060 --> 03:25:38,060
Like in the arms of an angel.

2273
03:25:38,060 --> 03:25:41,060
And I'm like, girl, why are you trying to look so pathetic?

2274
03:25:41,060 --> 03:25:50,060
You're just in a sink being cleaned.

2275
03:25:50,060 --> 03:25:55,060
Yes, I was burping feet over my shoulder. That's why you hear those patting noises.

2276
03:25:55,060 --> 03:26:01,060
Alright, she's laying in the bed now on my desk and she looks already super tired.

2277
03:26:01,060 --> 03:26:05,060
So now I'm going to go make my ramen. Excuse me, cats.

2278
03:26:05,060 --> 03:26:12,060
There's 50 of you, just two, but, you know, 50.

2279
03:26:12,060 --> 03:26:17,060
Raina, can you say please? Raina.

2280
03:26:17,060 --> 03:26:20,060
Can you say please? That's it.

2281
03:26:20,060 --> 03:26:22,060
Good girl.

2282
03:26:22,060 --> 03:26:25,060
Bowie, you could wear a thing or two from your elders.

2283
03:26:25,060 --> 03:26:29,060
Raina, speak.

2284
03:26:29,060 --> 03:26:32,060
Raina, that was too quiet. Raina, speak.

2285
03:26:32,060 --> 03:26:34,060
Raina.

2286
03:26:34,060 --> 03:26:36,060
Raina, what's going on?

2287
03:26:38,060 --> 03:26:40,060
Speak.

2288
03:26:40,060 --> 03:26:43,060
Okay, you're just silent, Bowie. It's fine.

2289
03:26:43,060 --> 03:26:50,060
Hey, Bill, you there?

2290
03:26:50,060 --> 03:26:53,060
She doesn't need to give you just可以.

2291
03:26:54,060 --> 03:27:03,060
I mean, Raina, you speak. She went...

2292
03:27:03,060 --> 03:27:06,060
Hi.

2293
03:27:07,060 --> 03:27:09,060
I wonder how the cats don't hate water.

2294
03:27:09,060 --> 03:27:17,140
tub um so I feel so I cling to you in the sink and um you always want to put a towel down just so

2295
03:27:17,140 --> 03:27:23,700
that they because they they don't have traction in a tub um or in a sink so you so the one that's

2296
03:27:23,700 --> 03:27:29,700
once they can grip on to something on in the water then they're fine um it also is hard for them

2297
03:27:29,700 --> 03:27:33,460
it's kind of frightening because of how their coats work they get really weighed down so that's

2298
03:27:33,460 --> 03:27:40,260
why it's something to the sense of panic um I believe you're coming to check on for you

2299
03:27:46,260 --> 03:27:53,300
making sure you can't pass my hand girl get down dude if you have some space

2300
03:27:53,300 --> 03:27:56,420
here you can call my chair because you get

2301
03:27:57,860 --> 03:27:58,740
don't honk at me

2302
03:28:00,580 --> 03:28:01,540
you got the zoos

2303
03:28:02,100 --> 03:28:03,060
you got the zoos

2304
03:28:04,100 --> 03:28:05,060
boy we got the zoos

2305
03:28:53,700 --> 03:29:11,060
so I don't like a lot of water in my roman to be honest with you

2306
03:29:12,660 --> 03:29:17,060
I don't like a lot of broth unless it's like traditional roman but if it's like um

2307
03:29:18,020 --> 03:29:19,780
it's like package roman

2308
03:29:21,780 --> 03:29:22,420
then I'm like

2309
03:29:24,340 --> 03:29:24,740
all right

2310
03:29:26,820 --> 03:29:27,620
a little bit less

2311
03:29:31,220 --> 03:29:34,020
and I only put a little bit of the old up spicy uh

2312
03:29:37,620 --> 03:29:40,020
spicy stuff in mine because I don't handle spice that well

2313
03:29:43,060 --> 03:29:46,100
my four bears are very disappointed I'm sure

2314
03:29:47,060 --> 03:29:55,140
and then I'll put

2315
03:29:59,220 --> 03:30:04,740
some meat in it if I have any but I would have advice the sausage was defrosted I would

2316
03:30:05,460 --> 03:30:10,340
sausage is indeed frozen I should probably put that out

2317
03:30:22,340 --> 03:30:23,220
hello

03:30:27,780 --> 03:30:31,300

2412
03:42:15,540 --> 03:42:22,900
trying to think of a punny punny thing

2413
03:42:45,540 --> 03:42:54,900
uh

2414
03:42:54,900 --> 03:43:20,900
This is a small bowl, I decided to mix this in, so it's kind of a bad idea.

2415
03:43:21,900 --> 03:43:24,900
What are you doing?

2416
03:43:24,900 --> 03:43:27,900
Boomi, did you find your toy?

2417
03:43:27,900 --> 03:43:29,900
He's walking around with a spray in his mouth.

2418
03:43:29,900 --> 03:43:31,900
What are you doing?

2419
03:43:33,900 --> 03:43:36,900
Oh yeah, I also got them a clay tunnel.

2420
03:43:36,900 --> 03:43:42,900
And Boomi and Prada love the clay tunnel, and I know Fia will once she gets back on her feet.

2421
03:43:50,900 --> 03:44:14,900
Mixing, mixing, mixing, we are mixing.

2422
03:44:14,900 --> 03:44:16,900
This flavor is so good.

2423
03:44:16,900 --> 03:44:42,900
The carbonara one, I didn't realize it's even like a little cheesy, which is I think carbonara has the cheesiness that I'm just done.

2424
03:44:42,900 --> 03:44:48,900
You should sell with paper towels for what's called messes with Boomi names.

2425
03:44:48,900 --> 03:44:50,900
Hi, mister.

2426
03:44:50,900 --> 03:44:52,900
What are you doing?

2427
03:44:52,900 --> 03:44:55,900
Yeah.

2428
03:44:55,900 --> 03:45:07,900
Oh, thank you for the headbutt.

2429
03:45:07,900 --> 03:45:13,900
The trouble me hours.

2430
03:45:13,900 --> 03:45:15,900
The cat and bums?

2431
03:45:15,900 --> 03:45:18,900
Oh, actually a hashtag cat and bum.

2432
03:45:18,900 --> 03:45:20,900
That'd be funny.

2433
03:45:20,900 --> 03:45:41,900
Cat and bum.

2434
03:45:41,900 --> 03:45:44,900
Fia's looking at me like you're going to share some of that, and I'm like, no.

2435
03:45:44,900 --> 03:45:47,900
You have the disposition of a sickly Victorian child right now, Fia.

2436
03:45:47,900 --> 03:45:48,900
You cannot have this.

2437
03:45:48,900 --> 03:45:54,900
It is spicy.

2438
03:45:54,900 --> 03:45:56,900
Thank you guys for all the soupas.

2439
03:45:56,900 --> 03:45:58,900
You guys are absolutely insane.

2440
03:45:58,900 --> 03:46:00,900
Ridiculous, even.

2441
03:46:00,900 --> 03:46:02,900
How dare you?

2442
03:46:02,900 --> 03:46:05,900
How dare you support Boomi?

2443
03:46:05,900 --> 03:46:14,900
Out of everybody here.

2444
03:46:14,900 --> 03:46:18,900
What?

2445
03:46:18,900 --> 03:46:21,900
What did you do?

2446
03:46:21,900 --> 03:46:24,900
What are you doing?

2447
03:46:24,900 --> 03:46:29,900
Can you guess who that was?

2448
03:46:29,900 --> 03:46:40,900
That was Boomi yelling.

2449
03:46:40,900 --> 03:46:41,900
Yeah, you thought it was Raina.

2450
03:46:41,900 --> 03:46:43,900
It was not.

2451
03:46:43,900 --> 03:46:45,900
Boomi, did you?

2452
03:46:45,900 --> 03:46:52,900
No, he makes that meow when he loses something and he wants my help.

2453
03:46:52,900 --> 03:46:56,900
He knocked his toy under the fridge, so I'm going to go get it for him.

2454
03:46:56,900 --> 03:47:01,900
The noodles are spicy.

2455
03:47:01,900 --> 03:47:03,900
Yeah, he does get...

2456
03:47:03,900 --> 03:47:06,900
I was really spending time with him earlier, so I don't know.

2457
03:47:06,900 --> 03:47:08,900
He just wants to hang out.

2458
03:47:08,900 --> 03:47:09,900
Hi.

2459
03:47:09,900 --> 03:47:10,900
Hi, handsome.

2460
03:47:10,900 --> 03:47:11,900
What did you do with it?

2461
03:47:11,900 --> 03:47:14,900
Where'd you go?

2462
03:47:14,900 --> 03:47:19,900
You knocked it?

2463
03:47:19,900 --> 03:47:22,900
It's okay.

2464
03:47:22,900 --> 03:47:24,900
Yeah.

2465
03:47:24,900 --> 03:47:29,900
Yeah, I'm going to get it for you.

2466
03:47:29,900 --> 03:47:33,900
You have to step out of the way so I can get it.

2467
03:47:33,900 --> 03:47:35,900
Yes, you're very sweet.

2468
03:47:35,900 --> 03:47:42,900
Hey, Boomi.

2469
03:47:42,900 --> 03:47:45,900
Something's still in the water.

2470
03:47:45,900 --> 03:47:48,900
Oh, are you?

2471
03:47:48,900 --> 03:47:51,900
Get it.

2472
03:47:51,900 --> 03:48:00,900
I got it.

2473
03:48:00,900 --> 03:48:02,900
Yeah.

2474
03:48:02,900 --> 03:48:09,900
Here you go.

2475
03:48:09,900 --> 03:48:18,900
I don't know how I'm supposed to do this.

2476
03:48:18,900 --> 03:48:21,900
All right.

2477
03:48:21,900 --> 03:48:22,900
Sorry.

2478
03:48:22,900 --> 03:48:24,900
My son lost his toy.

2479
03:48:24,900 --> 03:48:25,900
Good night.

2480
03:48:25,900 --> 03:48:27,900
Have a good one.

2481
03:48:27,900 --> 03:48:29,900
I'm Fia head out.

2482
03:48:29,900 --> 03:48:31,900
I'm feeling EP.

2483
03:48:31,900 --> 03:48:32,900
Feline EP.

2484
03:48:32,900 --> 03:48:38,900
I like the puns.

2485
03:48:38,900 --> 03:48:41,900
Boomi asking for help after a time when you say...

2486
03:48:41,900 --> 03:48:42,900
And then you see...

2487
03:48:42,900 --> 03:48:43,900
Yeah, cat and bums.

2488
03:48:43,900 --> 03:48:45,900
I like cat and bums.

2489
03:48:45,900 --> 03:48:51,900
You see what I have to deal with?

2490
03:48:51,900 --> 03:48:58,900
He takes and he takes and he does not give.

2491
03:48:58,900 --> 03:49:00,900
Right, Fia?

2492
03:49:00,900 --> 03:49:01,900
How are you doing?

2493
03:49:01,900 --> 03:49:05,900
You're looking mighty content right now.

2494
03:49:05,900 --> 03:49:07,900
Your ear is kind of messed up when I picked it up for you.

2495
03:49:07,900 --> 03:49:12,900
There you go.

2496
03:49:12,900 --> 03:49:19,900
Yeah.

2497
03:49:19,900 --> 03:49:25,900
Oh my gosh, why are you so freaking cute, Fia?

2498
03:49:25,900 --> 03:49:28,900
He gives us an antagonist for the stream.

2499
03:49:28,900 --> 03:49:38,900
That's his purpose to be the antagonist.

2500
03:49:38,900 --> 03:49:40,900
He gives pouch.

2501
03:49:40,900 --> 03:49:41,900
Are you purring?

2502
03:49:41,900 --> 03:49:45,900
I can hear you.

2503
03:49:45,900 --> 03:49:46,900
Oh, you little girl.

2504
03:49:46,900 --> 03:49:50,900
Are you trying to purr?

2505
03:49:50,900 --> 03:49:56,900
My son is coming.

2506
03:49:56,900 --> 03:50:01,900
Yeah, when you have like cats, you kind of can pick up what they're trying to say.

2507
03:50:01,900 --> 03:50:04,900
Fia, are you purring?

2508
03:50:04,900 --> 03:50:18,900
Oh, why are you so cute?

2509
03:50:18,900 --> 03:50:21,900
I'm trying to think of what was the difference between picking up Fia and Boomi,

2510
03:50:21,900 --> 03:50:25,900
because they're not like actual siblings or month apart.

2511
03:50:25,900 --> 03:50:28,900
I rescued them from the same rescue, however,

2512
03:50:28,900 --> 03:50:35,900
they're not from the same litter.

2513
03:50:35,900 --> 03:50:39,900
Fia's just staring at me and purring, and it's really cute.

2514
03:50:39,900 --> 03:50:44,900
Little girl.

2515
03:50:44,900 --> 03:50:52,900
Wait, I thought I got donated 200 again, but it was just the thing.

2516
03:50:52,900 --> 03:50:56,900
Boomi was super noisy on the ride home.

2517
03:50:56,900 --> 03:51:00,900
I had to drove four hours to go get him.

2518
03:51:00,900 --> 03:51:10,900
Drove into another state, because they didn't bring pets to my area.

2519
03:51:10,900 --> 03:51:15,900
This cat voice isn't even supposed to talk.

2520
03:51:15,900 --> 03:51:19,900
And he was a very eepy baby.

2521
03:51:19,900 --> 03:51:24,900
Raina hated him off the rip, which is why I got Fia,

2522
03:51:24,900 --> 03:51:28,900
because I wanted Boomi to have a friend.

2523
03:51:28,900 --> 03:51:33,900
He was very snuggly. He always wanted to curl up on your chest.

2524
03:51:33,900 --> 03:51:36,900
He always wanted to play.

2525
03:51:36,900 --> 03:51:44,900
He never really meowed. He only recently started meowing.

2526
03:51:44,900 --> 03:51:51,900
To convey, is Boomi still freaked out by Zumba? Yes, he is.

2527
03:51:51,900 --> 03:51:56,900
I've only ran it that one time, because I wanted to give him a break in between.

2528
03:51:56,900 --> 03:52:06,900
My floor hasn't been covered in litter, so it's been fine.

2529
03:52:06,900 --> 03:52:12,900
I think I took a picture or video of Boomi and Raina playing with each other,

2530
03:52:12,900 --> 03:52:16,900
because of the tunnel, and I almost cried, because it was so precious.

2531
03:52:16,900 --> 03:52:23,900
I'm sorry to talk about my cats so much, but they're in my entire life.

2532
03:52:23,900 --> 03:52:34,900
Meows are just developed by cats, because they figured out that we are more responsive when they talk to us.

2533
03:52:34,900 --> 03:52:37,900
They're Siamese cats. They're all Siamese cats, though.

2534
03:52:37,900 --> 03:52:41,900
Siamese cats are very talkative, but Fia doesn't usually meow at all.

2535
03:52:41,900 --> 03:52:45,900
She only meows in the state, and when she's playing with a toy.

2536
03:52:45,900 --> 03:52:49,900
Raina meows all the time.

2537
03:52:49,900 --> 03:52:54,900
Boomi meows when he wants something, or when he's really, really happy to see me.

2538
03:52:54,900 --> 03:52:58,900
But most of the time, he does that little brrrr noise.

2539
03:52:58,900 --> 03:53:02,900
People complain about cats? No, no, no, guys, guys.

2540
03:53:02,900 --> 03:53:05,900
Nobody ever complains about anything.

2541
03:53:05,900 --> 03:53:12,900
When I also, I noticed that some people thought that from my tweet about me getting tan skin,

2542
03:53:12,900 --> 03:53:15,900
that people were hating on me, nobody was.

2543
03:53:15,900 --> 03:53:19,900
I was just saying, hey, if you don't like it, then suck it up.

2544
03:53:19,900 --> 03:53:24,900
But that's not me. People aren't actively hating on anything that I do.

2545
03:53:24,900 --> 03:53:27,900
So don't worry about me in that sense.

2546
03:53:27,900 --> 03:53:31,900
Yeah, Raina will sing. She was singing this morning.

2547
03:53:31,900 --> 03:53:36,900
And actually, she was singing right before I started to stream.

2548
03:53:39,900 --> 03:53:43,900
Fia has purred herself to sleep, but it's quite precious.

2549
03:53:43,900 --> 03:53:48,900
Yeah, I always just get out in front of stuff, 100%.

2550
03:53:54,900 --> 03:53:59,900
This ramen isn't that good.

2551
03:53:59,900 --> 03:54:02,900
The first time I had this ramen, it was delicious.

2552
03:54:02,900 --> 03:54:05,900
And then the last batch I made wasn't good, and then this isn't that good,

2553
03:54:05,900 --> 03:54:09,900
and I don't know what I'm doing wrong. What did I do differently?

2554
03:54:15,900 --> 03:54:18,900
I wonder if it's just like the batch and not me, because I'm like,

2555
03:54:18,900 --> 03:54:23,900
these noodles don't have a weird texture. They're not the same ones as before.

2556
03:54:25,900 --> 03:54:30,900
Kiddler.

2557
03:54:30,900 --> 03:54:36,900
No, I don't follow a recipe. I just kind of make it just packaged ramen.

2558
03:54:47,900 --> 03:54:51,900
Boomi, what are you doing? I heard Boomi sneezing.

2559
03:54:55,900 --> 03:55:01,900
Could you be getting sick?

2560
03:55:01,900 --> 03:55:05,900
I was just sick, so I hope not.

2561
03:55:05,900 --> 03:55:08,900
What are you doing this year?

2562
03:55:15,900 --> 03:55:19,900
Ow, what is this stuff on me?

2563
03:55:19,900 --> 03:55:23,900
Honey!

2564
03:55:23,900 --> 03:55:26,900
Now my mouth is on fire.

2565
03:55:26,900 --> 03:55:29,900
I'm on fire!

2566
03:55:44,900 --> 03:55:49,900
I want a strawberry milkshake.

2567
03:55:49,900 --> 03:55:54,900
Guys, I'm craving a strawberry milkshake.

2568
03:56:09,900 --> 03:56:14,900
Okay, I'm shutting off the light for Fiya, so my tracking might be a little bit wonky.

2569
03:56:15,900 --> 03:56:20,900
Because I'm going by the light on my computer.

2570
03:56:20,900 --> 03:56:24,900
It will kill you, no!

2571
03:56:24,900 --> 03:56:29,900
Not if I do like, if I take a lactate, like I never do.

2572
03:56:29,900 --> 03:56:33,900
That's true, I have done that before.

2573
03:56:33,900 --> 03:56:38,900
It's an extra step, walking to my bathroom, going to the medicine drawer,

2574
03:56:38,900 --> 03:56:44,900
pulling out the medicine, putting the medicine in my mouth, swallowing the medicine.

2575
03:56:44,900 --> 03:56:53,900
I'm going to the medicine drawer, pulling out the medicine, putting the medicine in my mouth, swallowing the medicine.

2576
03:56:53,900 --> 03:56:57,900
If that was a way to go, I'd die from a milkshake.

2577
03:57:15,900 --> 03:57:19,900
What flavor milkshake would a Zura make?

2578
03:57:23,900 --> 03:57:27,900
If you die, who will take care of their kitties?

2579
03:57:33,900 --> 03:57:36,900
Damn it, you got me.

2580
03:57:40,900 --> 03:57:44,900
A Zura flavor? Minty?

2581
03:57:53,900 --> 03:57:57,900
Oh wait, you're right.

2582
03:58:00,900 --> 03:58:04,900
Mint chocolate chip? Ooh, that would be tasty.

2583
03:58:04,900 --> 03:58:09,900
I feel like I would be like a strawberry because of the red.

2584
03:58:09,900 --> 03:58:14,900
I think emi would be like an orange creamsicle.

2585
03:58:14,900 --> 03:58:21,900
I see naturally would be lemon, or lemon blueberry.

2586
03:58:21,900 --> 03:58:26,900
And then strawnee could be like a green apple.

2587
03:58:26,900 --> 03:58:29,900
Wait, no, I'm thinking of snowcombs now.

2588
03:58:29,900 --> 03:58:33,900
Sherbet for emi.

2589
03:58:33,900 --> 03:58:36,900
Why sherbet? Why strawnee?

2590
03:58:36,900 --> 03:58:41,900
Strawnee would be like strawberry shortcake flavor.

2591
03:58:41,900 --> 03:58:44,900
Then that dives into what strawberry shortcake character?

2592
03:58:44,900 --> 03:58:47,900
Am I? Sorry.

2593
03:58:48,900 --> 03:58:52,900
Ooh, pumpkin. Duh, pumpkin.

2594
03:58:52,900 --> 03:58:56,900
Pumpkin? Oh my god, like a spiced pumpkin milkshake.

2595
03:58:56,900 --> 03:58:59,900
Oh my god, perfect for fall.

2596
03:58:59,900 --> 03:59:03,900
Oh, that sounds delicious. I'm gonna eat milkshake emi.

2597
03:59:08,900 --> 03:59:13,900
Great for mercy? Hmm.

2598
03:59:13,900 --> 03:59:17,900
I think, does mercy like coffee?

2599
03:59:17,900 --> 03:59:22,900
I don't think she does, because I feel like she would have a coffee flavor.

2600
03:59:22,900 --> 03:59:26,900
Fall is red. Fall is my favorite season. I love fall so much.

2601
03:59:26,900 --> 03:59:33,900
You got renaissance fairs, you got halloween, you got my birthday, you got um,

2602
03:59:33,900 --> 03:59:39,900
you got uh, what else do you get? Leaves?

2603
03:59:39,900 --> 03:59:42,900
I also just prefer the cold over the hot.

2604
03:59:42,900 --> 03:59:45,900
That's why I haven't gone outside so much.

2605
03:59:45,900 --> 03:59:49,900
Grape ice cream? I've never heard of grape ice cream.

2606
03:59:52,900 --> 03:59:55,900
No, don't. Sorry, I'll stop talking.

2607
03:59:55,900 --> 04:00:00,900
I was thinking, because my dad was like, you need to leave your house and go for a walk.

2608
04:00:00,900 --> 04:00:05,900
And I'm like, there's a gym in my apartment and I'm like, you know what,

2609
04:00:05,900 --> 04:00:10,900
I'm gonna start going for walks again. I need your guys help to motivate me.

2610
04:00:10,900 --> 04:00:14,900
I want to like, I'm trying, I need to strengthen my body a little bit.

2611
04:00:14,900 --> 04:00:17,900
I've been a little bit too sedentary when I since have become a streamer.

2612
04:00:17,900 --> 04:00:21,900
Where at my last job, I was on my feet for eight hours a day, essentially.

2613
04:00:21,900 --> 04:00:24,900
Minus, actually yeah.

2614
04:00:24,900 --> 04:00:30,900
Because I clocked out for lunch for an hour, because it was a nine hour shift and I have an hour lunch.

2615
04:00:30,900 --> 04:00:33,900
Yeah, so about eight hours.

2616
04:00:36,900 --> 04:00:38,900
Good food. I know I need to.

2617
04:00:38,900 --> 04:00:46,900
I'm telling you, I'm trying to get like, hello fresh or like, factor to like, sponsor me.

2618
04:00:46,900 --> 04:00:53,900
Because it was actually, because of the structure of the food,

2619
04:00:53,900 --> 04:00:58,900
it was just easier for me, like that type of person I am to make it more walkies.

2620
04:00:58,900 --> 04:01:01,900
Yeah, walkies.

2621
04:01:01,900 --> 04:01:08,900
Yeah, I need to get stronger. I'm just a frail, sickly child right now.

2622
04:01:08,900 --> 04:01:14,900
I feel like, like simple tasks have been hard for me. I don't know if it's my fibro progressing,

2623
04:01:14,900 --> 04:01:21,900
but my mom always said, because my mom is fibro too, that like the best thing she ever did was keep moving.

2624
04:01:21,900 --> 04:01:25,900
And so I'm like, yeah, maybe I need to do that.

2625
04:01:25,900 --> 04:01:27,900
Yeah, I like hello fresh.

2626
04:01:27,900 --> 04:01:31,900
I used to I used to eat that a lot.

2627
04:01:31,900 --> 04:01:35,900
You take any multiple vitamins? No, I just take my meds.

2628
04:01:35,900 --> 04:01:38,900
I used to take a multivitamin. Maybe I should do that again.

2629
04:01:38,900 --> 04:01:41,900
I think they I had like the vitamin gummies.

2630
04:01:41,900 --> 04:01:45,900
I don't know if they're still good because I have some still.

2631
04:01:45,900 --> 04:01:47,900
She be Jim arc.

2632
04:01:47,900 --> 04:01:52,900
I want to be able to because I like I can like lift a lot of my legs.

2633
04:01:52,900 --> 04:01:58,900
Cystic fibrosis no fibromyalgia.

2634
04:01:58,900 --> 04:02:08,900
Moving where what moving to outside and coming back inside.

2635
04:02:08,900 --> 04:02:18,900
But yeah, like you guys are keep telling me like you've been going to the gym and I haven't since I love because my job one of the cool benefits of my job was I got like free gym stuff.

2636
04:02:18,900 --> 04:02:26,900
So I would go to like the gym and then my apartment just got a gym.

2637
04:02:26,900 --> 04:02:31,900
And because it was closed for some time for whatever reason I can't recall.

2638
04:02:31,900 --> 04:02:36,900
So I'm like, oh, but I hate like the gym in my apartment. It's kind of dumb.

2639
04:02:36,900 --> 04:02:38,900
So I'm like, you know what?

2640
04:02:38,900 --> 04:02:45,900
Let me let me I need to try to eat better. I need to lay off the uncrustables.

2641
04:02:45,900 --> 04:02:55,900
Um, it's not like it's not like weight related. It's just like, I know like I'm putting like bad food in my body and it's not helping with my pain or anything.

2642
04:02:55,900 --> 04:03:03,900
I honestly, what's a weird thing is that so I've been gluten free and dairy free before.

2643
04:03:03,900 --> 04:03:05,900
And that was the best I felt.

2644
04:03:06,900 --> 04:03:10,900
My mom is gluten free and dairy free for the sake like for some odd reason.

2645
04:03:10,900 --> 04:03:16,900
American gluten just like does stuff to you and dairy causes inflammation.

2646
04:03:16,900 --> 04:03:21,900
So I think I might start drinking almond milk again and avoiding gluten.

2647
04:03:21,900 --> 04:03:25,900
It's just hard to do because there's not a lot of stores near me that sell gluten free items.

2648
04:03:25,900 --> 04:03:29,900
But I think there's like a Whole Foods nearby.

2649
04:03:29,900 --> 04:03:32,900
Maybe I can go to or like a Trader Joe's.

2650
04:03:33,900 --> 04:03:36,900
I know I have to say goodbye to uncrustables though.

2651
04:03:40,900 --> 04:03:44,900
Yeah, it's awkward because it's my they're my neighbors and I don't want them to see me.

2652
04:03:47,900 --> 04:03:49,900
Your throat just makes like they hard.

2653
04:03:49,900 --> 04:03:57,900
I need to like my my legs like surprisingly for having been sitting mostly for the past few months being a VTuber.

2654
04:03:57,900 --> 04:04:04,900
I still have a lot of good tone in my legs because again, I used to stand and walk and run a lot.

2655
04:04:04,900 --> 04:04:07,900
Thoughts on soy milk. I don't like soy milk.

2656
04:04:07,900 --> 04:04:11,900
I prefer oat milk over everything though.

2657
04:04:11,900 --> 04:04:15,900
Oat milk almond milk has a texture of like spit to me.

2658
04:04:15,900 --> 04:04:17,900
Like I don't know how to explain it.

2659
04:04:17,900 --> 04:04:18,900
Same thing with eggnog.

2660
04:04:18,900 --> 04:04:25,900
Like I can't drink eggnog because it tastes like I'm drinking spit and not even like the fun time kind, you know.

2661
04:04:28,900 --> 04:04:31,900
Yeah, I could make my own uncrustables.

2662
04:04:32,900 --> 04:04:35,900
Because then I can use gluten free bread.

2663
04:04:35,900 --> 04:04:36,900
Actually, I might do that.

2664
04:04:39,900 --> 04:04:42,900
I like like slightly sweetened.

2665
04:04:46,900 --> 04:04:48,900
Get a massage my leggies.

2666
04:04:48,900 --> 04:04:49,900
That'd be nice.

2667
04:04:51,900 --> 04:04:53,900
My legs actually don't hurt too much.

2668
04:04:53,900 --> 04:04:55,900
It's usually my upper body hurts a lot.

2669
04:04:55,900 --> 04:04:56,900
Like my shoulders.

2670
04:04:56,900 --> 04:05:03,900
Like I had to stay in a long position at the doctor the other day with my arm out for like blood drawing and stuff.

2671
04:05:03,900 --> 04:05:07,900
And like my shoulder was killing me.

2672
04:05:07,900 --> 04:05:11,900
Like it was like like my body was just like not having a good time.

2673
04:05:11,900 --> 04:05:15,900
And you know, I want to be TMI for a second.

2674
04:05:16,900 --> 04:05:20,900
You guys know I got huge Bosonga hungas.

2675
04:05:20,900 --> 04:05:26,900
And I noticed well because I had to drive far away from my appointment.

2676
04:05:26,900 --> 04:05:49,900
I was like I had to like move like pull my booba towards the center of my chest so I could because I had was resting my my hand on my arm on top of it while I was driving on my my my left arm and I'm like I have to move it out of the way.

2677
04:05:50,900 --> 04:05:56,900
And and then like my bra was like stabbing my inner arm.

2678
04:05:56,900 --> 04:05:59,900
And I'm like, bro, this is annoying.

2679
04:06:00,900 --> 04:06:06,900
And I got to like mush them together so I don't like cut off circulation to my inner arms.

2680
04:06:09,900 --> 04:06:13,900
They're they're like they're very annoying and in the way.

2681
04:06:21,900 --> 04:06:28,900
How often is this oh all the time splits them like the Red Sea.

2682
04:06:28,900 --> 04:06:32,900
Voice Tonka trucks.

2683
04:06:32,900 --> 04:06:36,900
Yeah, they're annoying and in the way a lot and they cause me a lot of pain.

2684
04:06:36,900 --> 04:06:38,900
No, she don't get a reduction.

2685
04:06:38,900 --> 04:06:41,900
Oh, cry harder.

2686
04:06:41,900 --> 04:06:43,900
Cry harder.

2687
04:06:44,900 --> 04:06:48,900
She be you just have to do this.

2688
04:06:48,900 --> 04:06:51,900
No, you're shut up.

2689
04:06:51,900 --> 04:06:58,900
Shut shut shut shut shut shut.

2690
04:06:58,900 --> 04:07:00,900
I am a VTuber.

2691
04:07:00,900 --> 04:07:07,900
If I was like an only fans creator, then I would get it because like that's sad or whatever.

2692
04:07:07,900 --> 04:07:11,900
But like you guys don't understand the amount of pain I get in.

2693
04:07:11,900 --> 04:07:15,900
So I'm sorry, but not sorry.

2694
04:07:15,900 --> 04:07:18,900
Guys, I'm not cutting them off.

2695
04:07:18,900 --> 04:07:20,900
Guys, I told you I'm an F.

2696
04:07:20,900 --> 04:07:23,900
I just want to be like a double D again or like a D.

2697
04:07:23,900 --> 04:07:25,900
That's it.

2698
04:07:25,900 --> 04:07:28,900
That's all I want.

2699
04:07:28,900 --> 04:07:31,900
And that's like don't get me wrong like I love them.

2700
04:07:31,900 --> 04:07:33,900
I love them very much.

2701
04:07:33,900 --> 04:07:45,900
If I didn't have to reduce them because of the pain in my neck and shoulders and back and my lower back constantly, then I wouldn't.

2702
04:07:45,900 --> 04:07:54,900
And I've done I've been to physical therapy for three years and I did a lot of stuff to like strengthen my back and my neck and all that stuff.

2703
04:07:54,900 --> 04:07:59,900
But it's just brother.

2704
04:07:59,900 --> 04:08:02,900
Yeah, I'm just guys.

2705
04:08:02,900 --> 04:08:04,900
I'm not getting like top surgery.

2706
04:08:04,900 --> 04:08:07,900
Why she's going to be cute.

2707
04:08:07,900 --> 04:08:09,900
Frontier.

2708
04:08:09,900 --> 04:08:11,900
What if you don't like the complications from the surgery?

2709
04:08:11,900 --> 04:08:13,900
You have the body of Victorian girl.

2710
04:08:13,900 --> 04:08:16,900
It's not really that bad.

2711
04:08:16,900 --> 04:08:28,900
I've seen I've seen what's it called just like this the surgery before because I'm weird and like to do that stuff.

2712
04:08:28,900 --> 04:08:30,900
So they're going to be redo.

2713
04:08:30,900 --> 04:08:32,900
What if I just stick it in my butt?

2714
04:08:32,900 --> 04:08:38,900
Then I have a strong but no, I'm not getting a guy's that's not how reductions work.

2715
04:08:38,900 --> 04:08:41,900
You can only reduce so much safely.

2716
04:08:41,900 --> 04:08:46,900
I can probably at most go down to a C safely.

2717
04:08:46,900 --> 04:08:49,900
And that's you can Google what those sizes are.

2718
04:08:49,900 --> 04:08:51,900
I know you're you're a guy.

2719
04:08:51,900 --> 04:08:53,900
You don't even know what I'm talking about.

2720
04:08:53,900 --> 04:08:55,900
Go Google the sizes.

2721
04:08:55,900 --> 04:08:58,900
Go Google the sizes right now.

2722
04:08:58,900 --> 04:09:04,900
And then you'll be like, oh wait, she'll still have big boot like relax.

2723
04:09:04,900 --> 04:09:20,900
Yeah, it'd be a lot of scarring and complications if I were to attempt to go to an A cup.

2724
04:09:21,900 --> 04:09:28,900
Okay, we're having a we're having a chat right now.

I'm educating men on sizes.

2732
04:10:14,900 --> 04:10:17,900
Save.

2733
04:10:17,900 --> 04:10:19,900
Will this work?

2734
04:10:19,900 --> 04:10:23,900
Or the Chaco?

2735
04:10:23,900 --> 04:10:25,900
This is just the best bra for whatever.

2736
04:10:25,900 --> 04:10:28,900
But I'm just using this as an example.

2737
04:10:28,900 --> 04:10:32,900
Images.

2738
04:10:32,900 --> 04:10:35,900

I just want to go to a C.

2744
04:10:49,900 --> 04:10:55,900
I'm an F.

2745
04:10:55,900 --> 04:10:57,900
Notice.

2746
04:10:57,900 --> 04:11:02,900
Like you see you see the girl with the B body type.

2747
04:11:02,900 --> 04:11:10,900
I have her body type but I have those.

2748
04:11:10,900 --> 04:11:15,900
It's not a fun time.

2749
04:11:15,900 --> 04:11:17,900

2750
04:11:17,900 --> 04:11:18,900

04:11:19,900 --> 04:11:22,900
I can show you the world.

2753
04:11:22,900 --> 04:11:26,900
Milk is kind of what bro.

2754
04:11:26,900 --> 04:11:29,900
I think you're I think you're far too back in the conversation.

2755
04:11:29,900 --> 04:11:34,900
He's talking about the milk still.

2756
04:11:34,900 --> 04:11:35,900
Yeah.

2757
04:11:35,900 --> 04:11:36,900
No, they're they're bigger.

2758
04:11:36,900 --> 04:11:41,900
Let me see if I'll find you F size F.

2759
04:11:41,900 --> 04:11:53,900
Where is F F.

2760
04:11:53,900 --> 04:11:56,900
Oh my God.

2761
04:11:56,900 --> 04:12:00,900
It's literally.

2762
04:12:00,900 --> 04:12:06,900
Yep.

2763
04:12:06,900 --> 04:12:09,900
That this looks kind of bad, but it's fine.

2764
04:12:09,900 --> 04:12:14,900
This this is F.

2765
04:12:14,900 --> 04:12:16,900
But I have a body type.

2766
04:12:16,900 --> 04:12:18,900
That's a lot smaller.

2767
04:12:18,900 --> 04:12:21,900
My back hurts.

2768
04:12:21,900 --> 04:12:22,900
Okay.

2769
04:12:22,900 --> 04:12:25,900
You're never it's not like it was funny.

2770
04:12:25,900 --> 04:12:26,900
I'm sorry.

2771
04:12:26,900 --> 04:12:27,900
I'm sorry.

2772
04:12:27,900 --> 04:12:28,900
I'm sorry.

2773
04:12:28,900 --> 04:12:31,900
I said she was like, you know, you should start bartending.

2774
04:12:31,900 --> 04:12:33,900
And I'm like, what, why?

2775
04:12:33,900 --> 04:12:36,900
She's like, see if you get more tips with larger boobs.

2776
04:12:36,900 --> 04:12:39,900
And then if you ever decide to get a reduction, see if the tips

2777
04:12:39,900 --> 04:12:40,900
change.

2778
04:12:40,900 --> 04:12:43,900
I'm like, you foul for that.

2779
04:12:43,900 --> 04:12:44,900
Um.

2780
04:12:44,900 --> 04:12:46,900
Yeah.

2781
04:12:46,900 --> 04:12:51,900
Top heavy, Top heavy.

2782
04:12:51,900 --> 04:12:56,840
And again, my bras caught and you're like, oh, you can change the bra

2783
04:12:57,620 --> 04:13:04,900
Yes, I have I can wear a sports bra still hurts. I wear a normal bra straps still hurt where

2784
04:13:06,140 --> 04:13:08,140
Seamless bras they still hurt

2785
04:13:08,980 --> 04:13:10,940
everything hurts

2786
04:13:10,940 --> 04:13:16,180
Constantly if I didn't have fibro, I'd probably be fine, but I have fibro so I will

2787
04:13:17,260 --> 04:13:19,260
Goodbye

2788
04:13:20,140 --> 04:13:26,140
How would she be streamed she's currently trying to justify getting a reduction to her male fan base who are screaming

2789
04:13:26,140 --> 04:13:32,060
No, although she's a vtuber and they'll never really see her boobs except very very rarely

2790
04:13:37,180 --> 04:13:39,180
Have you tried all of them at once

2791
04:13:39,900 --> 04:13:45,180
No bra. Yeah, no bra hurts because like my skin is being pulled down because they're so heavy

2792
04:13:45,900 --> 04:13:49,900
And again, it causes it causes

2793
04:13:51,900 --> 04:13:53,900
Like stretch marks and stuff

2794
04:13:56,860 --> 04:14:01,980
Yeah, you guys can you guys please hold these hold these because honestly holding them is

2795
04:14:02,900 --> 04:14:04,900
probably like the best

2796
04:14:05,300 --> 04:14:06,860
because

2797
04:14:06,860 --> 04:14:08,860
Like if I rest them on the table

2798
04:14:11,220 --> 04:14:13,220
If I rest them on the table

2799
04:14:14,100 --> 04:14:17,460
It feels the best because there's no stress on my shoulder

2800
04:14:19,140 --> 04:14:25,220
And there's no stress on stress on my back and I feel so weightless it is the funniest thing I

2801
04:14:25,860 --> 04:14:29,740
Feel so weightless and then when I sit up. I'm like wow. I just gained like 50 pounds

2802
04:14:31,860 --> 04:14:36,900
And you know sleeping I'm sorry, I'm going to rant about this right now sleeping I

2803
04:14:38,540 --> 04:14:40,540
Can't sleep on my stomach. I

2804
04:14:40,860 --> 04:14:45,740
Can barely sleep on my side when I sleep on my side my arm goes numb because the weight on my titty

2805
04:14:47,260 --> 04:14:50,700
How it rests I gotta tuck up tuck around

2806
04:14:52,620 --> 04:14:57,020
It cuts off circulation to my arm and my arms wake up numb

2807
04:15:02,700 --> 04:15:06,860
Is the physical exercise. Yes, I've done that when I was in physical therapy

2808
04:15:06,940 --> 04:15:08,940
Um

2809
04:15:11,180 --> 04:15:17,260
It was funny when I first went to apply for coverage for reduction because you have to like do that for americans

2810
04:15:18,860 --> 04:15:20,860
the

2811
04:15:21,900 --> 04:15:23,900
The male

2812
04:15:24,700 --> 04:15:25,820
Um

2813
04:15:25,820 --> 04:15:28,620
Surgeon general who was looking at my claim for the insurance

2814
04:15:29,340 --> 04:15:31,340
said

2815
04:15:31,420 --> 04:15:34,860
Because you don't have a rash under your boobs. You're fine and I'm like

2816

I'm sorry. I clean under my boobs. Like it was a am I supposed to let the like that just all the titty sweat

2817
04:15:41,100 --> 04:15:45,420

2818
04:15:48,300 --> 04:15:55,660
I'm sorry. I clean myself. I don't know what to tell you. I still I still permanent bruising on my shoulders from straps, so

2819
04:15:57,500 --> 04:16:01,580

2827
04:16:37,660 --> 04:16:40,220

2831
04:17:07,100 --> 04:17:09,100
Oh, that was funny

2832
04:17:10,620 --> 04:17:12,620

04:17:31,420 --> 04:17:33,420
Wait, why is my

2837
04:17:36,860 --> 04:17:39,180
It's a chat with fia. Are you purring in your sleep?

2838

2839
04:17:48,700 --> 04:17:50,700
Okay, there's no chat

2840
04:17:51,260 --> 04:17:52,860
I don't know what happened to the chat widget

2841
04:17:53,260 --> 04:17:58,220
I think mercy was mentioning that I broke all the chat widgets like some sort of update on obs

2842
04:17:58,780 --> 04:18:00,780
All right, we're going to my bedroom

04:18:04,940 --> 04:18:06,940
What are you talking about?

2844
04:18:09,820 --> 04:18:11,820
Good yawn

He is just quietly purring beside me and it's quite adorable

2849
04:18:41,100 --> 04:18:49,340
Chat summary viewers are jokingly discussing preferences for body types and preferences for adult activities involving those body types. What?

2850
04:18:51,660 --> 04:18:53,660
AI what are you talking about?

2851
04:18:54,940 --> 04:18:56,940
That's not what we're doing at all

2852
04:18:58,220 --> 04:19:01,420
We're talking about reductions. What are you? What do you want?

2853
04:19:06,940 --> 04:19:08,940
Oh my god

2854

Yeah, that's uh, that's that's the last I'll speak of the reduction stuff because I know it

2856
04:19:17,900 --> 04:19:19,900

2859
04:19:36,620 --> 04:19:38,620
Oh my god

All right, let me just

He just has a long pouch for some reason. I don't even know why because it's like

2916
04:25:36,780 --> 04:25:41,820
The primordial pouch is like a fat storage for like animals in case of like danger

Where men's 16 men's 10 is still big see I told you I got big feet

3004
04:34:59,180 --> 04:35:04,060
I don't have small dainty feet. I'm sorry my mom is cute small dainty feet. She's a size eight

3005
04:35:05,020 --> 04:35:07,020
She had like it's funny because um

3006
04:35:08,060 --> 04:35:13,420
My mom used to wear like a lot a lot of high heel shoes and platform shoes because she was like it worked in an office

3007
04:35:13,980 --> 04:35:16,220
And my mom had like my mom has some nice feet

3008
04:35:17,500 --> 04:35:19,740
Oh my my dad lucky. He got a woman with nice feet

3009
04:35:22,300 --> 04:35:25,740
But I was so frustrated because I never fit into my mom's really nice high heeled shoes

3010
04:35:25,740 --> 04:35:29,180
So I couldn't inherit them because she has some she got some nice ass shoes

3011
04:35:29,980 --> 04:35:31,980
Maybe I'll steal them and sell them on the internet

3012
04:35:34,380 --> 04:35:36,380

04:35:37,900 --> 04:35:40,460

3017
04:36:00,300 --> 04:36:02,460
My co-workers used to call them my shit kickers

3018
04:36:03,340 --> 04:36:06,940
And I would be much much taller than my my customers when I wore them

3019
04:36:09,980 --> 04:36:12,460
She went to sleep her child with the high heels

3020
04:36:13,100 --> 04:36:18,380
My mother my mother never busted out the shanka because again, she's a she's a white woman. So, um

3021
04:36:20,140 --> 04:36:22,780
She mostly just like grabbed me by the ear and she was like

3022
04:36:22,940 --> 04:36:24,940
What are you doing?

3023
04:36:29,100 --> 04:36:31,100
What do you think about ugg boots? Uh

3024
04:36:32,700 --> 04:36:35,180
They were cooler like 10 years ago

3025
04:36:37,740 --> 04:36:39,740
Honestly, I just wear crocs and docks

3026
04:36:41,180 --> 04:36:43,180
That rhymes um

3027
04:36:45,260 --> 04:36:48,620
Yes, I'm about like six feet in heels. So, uh

04:36:49,580 --> 04:36:51,580
Yeah, the women's is 8.5. Yeah

3029
04:36:52,540 --> 04:36:54,540
Yeah, I'm I'm a 9.5

3030
04:36:54,780 --> 04:36:59,420
But I like I fluctuate because sometimes there'll be a nine sometimes there'll be a 9.5

3031
04:36:59,500 --> 04:37:01,500
Sometimes there'll be a 10 depending on the shoe

3032
04:37:03,500 --> 04:37:08,300
I like high tops I prefer high tops like I used to have I always wore high top converse

3033
04:37:09,100 --> 04:37:14,620
um, I have high top canvas doc martins because I used to make those I got those off of um

3034
04:37:15,660 --> 04:37:17,660

3035
04:37:18,300 --> 04:37:20,300
um

3036
04:37:21,340 --> 04:37:23,340
Yeah, I have uh

3037
04:37:23,420 --> 04:37:26,300
What are those I have these hiking shoes

3038
04:37:26,940 --> 04:37:28,940
that I really fought like

3039
04:37:28,940 --> 04:37:36,620
ran over the place for because I my feet are very particular because one of my uh, my right ankle gets inflamed really easily. Um

3040
04:37:37,900 --> 04:37:40,940
It will also just roll really easily. I don't know why

3041
04:37:41,900 --> 04:37:43,900
My right ankle is like that. Um

3042
04:37:44,380 --> 04:37:50,060
Um, but so I have to have something with really good ankle support when I go hiking and um

We stand big

3047
04:38:12,700 --> 04:38:20,460
Muscular we stand the the skinny and lean. We stand the the fluffy boys up in here

3048
04:38:24,220 --> 04:38:26,780
Our anchor to the river you get literally though

3049
04:38:28,620 --> 04:38:32,780
I remember I I always have people come up to be like you ball you ball you must ball you must ball and I'm like

3050
04:38:34,300 --> 04:38:39,100
No, I like anime and I like reading books. I don't like um

3051
04:38:40,060 --> 04:38:42,060
I don't like do sports

3052
04:38:45,740 --> 04:38:47,740
But I'm five six and he leaves

04:38:56,380 --> 04:38:58,380
This is perfect boys

3056
04:38:59,100 --> 04:39:01,100
And it's funny because my dad used to coach

3057
04:39:01,820 --> 04:39:03,820
so I was just like

3058
04:39:04,540 --> 04:39:07,980
People were so disappointed that I couldn't play basketball

3059
04:39:09,500 --> 04:39:11,500
Be like your dad

3060
04:39:11,820 --> 04:39:15,180
Watching eSports at all recently got into anime. No, I don't watch any sports

3061
04:39:15,980 --> 04:39:18,620
The only sports I was watching is sports

3062
04:39:19,500 --> 04:39:20,540
um

3063
04:39:20,540 --> 04:39:23,340
And it's funny like my dad worked with a lot of

3064
04:39:25,260 --> 04:39:32,300
Uh, well not a lot of a few famous basketballers who have gotten into the NBA. He mentored them. He helped them

3065
04:39:33,100 --> 04:39:35,100
um

3066
04:39:35,100 --> 04:39:38,060
And like then there's me just who can't play as basketball

3067
04:39:38,780 --> 04:39:41,980
Can't play basketball. Yeah, my dad did that as a side job for a bit

3068
04:39:43,820 --> 04:39:45,340
Uh

3069
04:39:45,340 --> 04:39:47,340
There we go

3070
04:39:55,660 --> 04:39:57,500
Don't worry about that

3071
04:39:57,500 --> 04:40:02,940
Might just work my controller on accident. I didn't even smash it this time. Did I break it?

3072
04:40:05,900 --> 04:40:08,540
Oh, she's gone. Oh, no

3073
04:40:11,100 --> 04:40:13,900
No, I didn't even break it on purpose

3074
04:40:15,900 --> 04:40:17,900
It has knocked it off my desk

3075
04:40:18,700 --> 04:40:20,860
Come back to life come back to me

3076
04:40:22,700 --> 04:40:24,700

04:40:29,180 --> 04:40:32,620
How did this break it didn't even fall from up high like high

3079
04:40:35,340 --> 04:40:37,340

3081
04:40:45,020 --> 04:40:46,780
damn

3082
04:40:46,780 --> 04:40:48,780
Are you serious?

3083
04:40:49,500 --> 04:40:54,860
You know, it was like this one was red like like me like it like it fit me perfectly like my like

3084
04:40:55,580 --> 04:40:59,500
It was red and black my my playstation controller. It was like a maroon red

3085
04:41:00,460 --> 04:41:05,420
Uh playstation 5. I don't know. I just dropped it doesn't even have any cracks. It won't turn on

3086
04:41:12,460 --> 04:41:16,780
Something must have gotten like undone like came on like on

3087
04:41:19,260 --> 04:41:21,260
Wait, I'm coming undone

3088
04:41:23,500 --> 04:41:27,100
So I'm assuming something got like messed up, but it like dropped this one time

3089
04:41:27,420 --> 04:41:30,780
I'm trying to figure out how to open it because now I just fixed it myself, but I can't open this

3090
04:41:31,260 --> 04:41:33,260
There must be a tool you need

3091
04:41:37,420 --> 04:41:39,900
Oh, hello, I just broke my controller

3092
04:41:42,060 --> 04:41:43,260
Hi

3093
04:41:43,260 --> 04:41:46,860
We're getting raided. We got we got we're getting re-rated

3094
04:41:47,580 --> 04:41:50,300
Because stronti raided us earlier and then we weren't even screaming

3095
04:41:51,340 --> 04:41:54,060
I dropped my controller and I broke it. So, uh

3096
04:41:55,020 --> 04:41:59,420
I didn't even rage it literally just fell off of my desk because I've nudged it

3097
04:42:00,860 --> 04:42:02,860
I'm very sad

3098
04:42:04,540 --> 04:42:10,860
I like this controller a lot I do have that I do have some pc tools

3099
04:42:16,940 --> 04:42:22,700
Oh, sorry for you. I don't mean to bang on the desk. No, I literally just I literally bumped you with my hand

3100
04:42:22,780 --> 04:42:26,780
It was on the corner of my desk. Well, I'll say I'll put this off to the side

3101
04:42:27,900 --> 04:42:33,900
Um, so if I do rage at a game I can smash that controller instead

3102
04:42:37,100 --> 04:42:40,060
Blame it. Yeah, it's probably boomies fault. I blame boomie

3103
04:42:41,580 --> 04:42:45,900
But how you guys doing reflames? How you doing? Hello? It's me. She me cotton bum

3105
04:42:52,700 --> 04:42:59,100
Yeah, I don't I don't understand because the blue light's not coming on. It's fully charged. I was playing with it like a second ago

3106
04:43:00,700 --> 04:43:04,620
Uh, do we have maybe I can ask my dad for a controller?

3107
04:43:06,060 --> 04:43:08,060
Because my dad has a ps5

3108
04:43:10,540 --> 04:43:13,580
Because I have games to play that require a controller

3109
04:43:16,060 --> 04:43:19,100
It literally dropped from like hold on where did the little

3110
04:43:20,060 --> 04:43:22,540
Where did the I know I put the the um

3111
04:43:24,300 --> 04:43:30,220
It was like a boomie and a half pouch away from the ground. It was probably like 30 inches

3112
04:43:34,060 --> 04:43:41,020
Micro celebrity, I'm a niche internet celebrity. My name is she be cotton bum and you're watching

3116
04:44:04,860 --> 04:44:06,860
It's a ps5 controller

3117
04:44:09,740 --> 04:44:12,140
I plugged it in let me try to plug it in a different one

3118
04:44:13,420 --> 04:44:15,580
This is not a cop. Don't don't come for me like that

3119
04:44:16,380 --> 04:44:21,980
Hit the oh true. Yeah, there's a hole in the back. I don't think I have anything to poke it

3120
04:44:38,620 --> 04:44:40,620

3122
04:44:56,860 --> 04:44:59,740
I swear I've had two controllers. I might have another controller

3123
04:45:04,780 --> 04:45:09,500

3142
04:47:24,940 --> 04:47:26,940
Um

3143
04:47:29,020 --> 04:47:33,420

3144
04:47:34,860 --> 04:47:36,860
So never mind

3145
04:47:37,020 --> 04:47:39,020

Okay, the AI isn't coming up. So I guess I will never know I am forbidden. Let me turn off Hades

3207
04:53:07,820 --> 04:53:09,820
Wait

3208
04:53:13,180 --> 04:53:17,980
Oh, yeah, no progress saved 108 minutes ago

3209
04:53:21,420 --> 04:53:27,980
Yeah, I'll try to swing by I won't make you guys pay for that actually. I don't I feel I would feel bad

3210
04:53:29,100 --> 04:53:31,100
Now that I think of it

3211
04:53:31,180 --> 04:53:32,540
I don't want

3212
04:53:32,540 --> 04:53:36,220
You guys to think I see you. I was just like, oh something's broken. Just add it to throne

3213
04:53:38,060 --> 04:53:40,060
Okay, I'm gonna buy it for me

3214
04:53:44,380 --> 04:53:49,340
Oh usually the AI summaries at the top of the chat like not like like scroll all the way up

3215
04:53:49,340 --> 04:53:53,820
But usually just like hang it out for a little bit then it'll go away. That's what we're here for

3216
04:53:54,940 --> 04:53:58,700
No, you think you're here just to give me stuff

3217
04:53:59,660 --> 04:54:01,660
No, you're here because I want attention

3218
04:54:04,860 --> 04:54:06,860
This is what

3219
04:54:07,260 --> 04:54:13,180
I don't have you as my audience because I'm trying to as uh someone is so

3220
04:54:14,220 --> 04:54:16,220
Funnily joking about

3221
04:54:18,460 --> 04:54:22,380
Um, I'm not here to rinse your pockets kid

3222
04:54:23,980 --> 04:54:31,020
I'm here to make memes and laugh and become a niche internet celebrity like I've always wanted because I like attention

3223
04:54:31,580 --> 04:54:38,300
So we're here for the cats. Yeah, you're here for the cats

3224
04:54:42,220 --> 04:54:44,220
I'm a very lonely person. I need attention

3225
04:54:47,820 --> 04:54:52,380
Because you guys like I did well paying job before I left it like

3226
04:54:54,300 --> 04:54:56,300
I was I was fine like

3227
04:54:57,260 --> 04:55:01,740
I wasn't just like, you know, I'm doing this for them. No

3228
04:55:03,100 --> 04:55:07,740
Doing this because I I I was very very depressed and um

3229
04:55:09,340 --> 04:55:14,140
I needed I realized I needed a creative outlet. So I started streaming as a vtuber

3230
04:55:15,420 --> 04:55:17,420
um, and it was

3231
04:55:17,500 --> 04:55:20,460
Absolutely amazing for me. Like a lot of people saw a change in me

3232
04:55:21,100 --> 04:55:24,780
Because I was being a lot more creative like designing stuff spending time with new people

3233
04:55:25,500 --> 04:55:28,700
It was really cool. Um, and so I'm happy I can still have that

3234
04:55:30,460 --> 04:55:32,460
This is definitely a better job

3235
04:55:35,980 --> 04:55:41,260
Obviously the dummy mommy sad girl hours, you know, it was like really hard

3236
04:55:42,140 --> 04:55:44,140
Having to go to the office all the time

3237
04:55:49,100 --> 04:55:51,100
Sorry for you

3238
04:55:55,500 --> 04:55:57,500
Oh

3239
04:56:00,140 --> 04:56:03,020
It's okay. Yeah, I'm not I can make you feel better

3240
04:56:04,700 --> 04:56:08,060
You build gumplug. Yeah, like so everybody has a thing that they do

3241
04:56:09,420 --> 04:56:11,420
To make themselves feel better

3242
04:56:12,140 --> 04:56:15,660
Oh my god, I'm saving so much money not driving so much money

3243
04:56:20,060 --> 04:56:23,100
Yes, I spent you spent so much money on starbucks

3244
04:56:25,260 --> 04:56:27,420
So much money on starbucks bad

3245
04:56:29,020 --> 04:56:32,300
Starbucks is so expensive expensive. I can't talk today

3246
04:56:34,140 --> 04:56:36,140
Jorkin makes me

3247
04:56:36,700 --> 04:56:38,700
You know what

3248
04:56:38,700 --> 04:56:44,540
You know that one gif of that lady who has like takes her glasses off or she adjusts them and she just like spreads her arms

3249
04:56:44,540 --> 04:56:48,300
It's like, well, yeah, that's what that's what we're here for like, you know

3250
04:56:50,540 --> 04:56:53,420
Welcome fellow coomer, you know, what can I say?

3251
04:56:54,780 --> 04:56:57,980
Sometimes you just got to jork it jorker peanuts

3252
04:56:59,420 --> 04:57:01,420
He's gripping it

3253
04:57:02,780 --> 04:57:04,780
What wait, hold on a second

3254
04:57:07,340 --> 04:57:12,780
Gas has been insane the first assignment farting, um, but yes the prices of gas have been

3255
04:57:13,420 --> 04:57:16,060
Astronomical got a willy the wonka

3256
04:57:17,740 --> 04:57:19,740
Got a shibbity my cotton bum

3257
04:57:20,540 --> 04:57:21,980
got a

3258
04:57:21,980 --> 04:57:23,980
Shib

3259
04:57:25,500 --> 04:57:28,460
I'm getting so many ads on my own freaking stream stop

3260
04:57:37,900 --> 04:57:40,540
I uh, I have a cover-up toggle

3261
04:57:41,820 --> 04:57:43,340
But I

3262
04:57:43,340 --> 04:57:48,620
I don't know if it's actually on this model if it's on the way still I should probably at strawney. Are you still here?

3263
04:57:48,620 --> 04:57:50,620
She's probably asleep

3264
04:57:50,780 --> 04:57:52,780
She probably knocked out

3265
04:57:53,100 --> 04:57:56,140
What time is it an upside down land? I don't even know

3266
04:57:58,540 --> 04:58:00,780
Does she need to flee? What do you mean?

3267
04:58:03,260 --> 04:58:05,020
She be соответfy do be do be do

3268
04:58:06,540 --> 04:58:10,940
She not even mom is in the bath. Mommy. I'm going to message you

3269
04:58:15,260 --> 04:58:17,260
I

3270
04:58:22,780 --> 04:58:31,860
Hi, are you diddling yourself in the bath?

3271
04:58:31,860 --> 04:58:35,660
Hello, JK.

3272
04:58:35,660 --> 04:58:49,340
Anyways, have you learned about my coverup toggle progress?

3273
04:58:49,340 --> 04:59:05,500
She's not my boss, she's not my boss, she's my friend.

3274
04:59:05,500 --> 04:59:12,860
I don't see, I don't see Strania's boss, well like, obviously, you know, she has the

3275
04:59:12,860 --> 04:59:18,660
last say in things, but I don't see her like, she's my boss, I better read that as no, no,

3276
04:59:18,660 --> 04:59:26,140
she's my, she's like my co-worker, she's my friend.

3277
04:59:26,140 --> 04:59:30,700
I knew, yeah, she's, she's my boss bestie.

3278
04:59:30,700 --> 04:59:31,700
Our cohort.

3279
04:59:31,700 --> 04:59:39,580
She's taking it straight on the way, my god.

3280
04:59:39,580 --> 04:59:40,820
You like our dynamic?

3281
04:59:40,820 --> 04:59:45,500
Yeah, we all got a cool dynamic.

3282
04:59:45,500 --> 04:59:57,460
Yeah, she actually doesn't see stuff, well no, that's the investor, Strania's different,

3283
04:59:57,460 --> 05:00:00,900
other different people.

3284
05:00:00,900 --> 05:00:06,340
What do you mean?

3285
05:00:06,340 --> 05:00:18,460
Again, like, I, I think what makes me different from, because like, I had a good relationship

3286
05:00:18,460 --> 05:00:23,620
with my bosses at my last job, like, we're all very like, chill, and so I think it's

3287
05:00:23,620 --> 05:00:27,660
a little bit easier for me to be that way with Strania, it might be difficult for the

3288
05:00:27,660 --> 05:00:35,460
other girls, because they're like, pretty, like, I sometimes still get, oh my god, boomie,

3289
05:00:35,540 --> 05:00:37,540
harassing Reina.

3290
05:00:37,540 --> 05:00:38,540
Boomie.

3291
05:00:38,540 --> 05:00:43,540
Reina, are you okay?

3292
05:00:43,540 --> 05:00:46,540
You good?

3293
05:00:46,540 --> 05:00:50,780
Vigorously lick self.

3294
05:00:50,780 --> 05:00:54,420
And I think like, if you've been used to having like crappy bosses, it's hard to like, be

3295
05:00:54,420 --> 05:00:57,220
vulnerable and open yourself up to them.

3296
05:00:57,220 --> 05:01:03,460
But she does a great job, I'm very proud of her, she's also growing a lot too, like she

3297
05:01:03,500 --> 05:01:08,300
takes a lot of feedback really well, like, if she's like, should I do this?

3298
05:01:08,300 --> 05:01:11,380
I'm like, well, this could happen, or this could happen.

3299
05:01:11,380 --> 05:01:13,900
And she's like, thank you for your advice, you beat.

3300
05:01:13,900 --> 05:01:19,700
And I'm like, anytime, because just like my lore, it's pretty accurate.

3301
05:01:19,700 --> 05:01:28,100
I used to work in a very corporate environment, really big execs of a really big, huge company.

3302
05:01:28,100 --> 05:01:35,740
So I'm very used to, if you're used to that, having that sort of professionalism, but also

3303
05:01:35,740 --> 05:01:37,180
like maintaining friendships.

3304
05:01:42,180 --> 05:01:44,060
Change of time as a V-Lir company goes public.

3305
05:01:44,060 --> 05:01:47,180
I don't really think that'll be a thing.

3306
05:01:47,180 --> 05:01:49,140
Like, we're a small agency.

3307
05:01:49,140 --> 05:01:54,060
I don't think we're going to be like, hollow or needy, where you can like, buy stuff.

3308
05:01:54,100 --> 05:01:58,220
Because like, I don't think any is idol publicly traded, was it?

3309
05:01:58,220 --> 05:02:00,740
Oh, boomie, stop.

3310
05:02:00,740 --> 05:02:02,020
You're done, bro.

3311
05:02:02,020 --> 05:02:04,300
You're literally scared, Reina, all the way to my desk.

3312
05:02:04,300 --> 05:02:06,100
Are you OK?

3313
05:02:06,100 --> 05:02:08,900
You OK, my mish?

3314
05:02:08,900 --> 05:02:10,420
It's OK, Reina, you can hang out.

3315
05:02:13,420 --> 05:02:15,900
He's literally just like, try to reach up and like, bap her.

3316
05:02:19,780 --> 05:02:23,820
Yeah, we haven't been growing really well.

3317
05:02:23,820 --> 05:02:27,140
Mom, yeah, you guys hear like, the sternness in my voice.

3318
05:02:27,140 --> 05:02:29,700
Did you just hear that?

3319
05:02:29,700 --> 05:02:31,460
Boomie, do you have the zoomies?

3320
05:02:31,460 --> 05:02:32,420
I gave you a toy.

3321
05:02:35,100 --> 05:02:36,500
Reina's staring at my model.

3322
05:02:36,500 --> 05:02:37,780
Idol was bought by Globy.

3323
05:02:37,780 --> 05:02:39,860
You mean by Brave Group, who owns Globy?

3324
05:02:43,180 --> 05:02:47,460
Yeah, I don't think that'll be a thing.

3325
05:02:47,460 --> 05:02:49,220
I don't think we'll ever grow that much.

3326
05:02:49,220 --> 05:02:53,100
And I kind of hope, I don't think Strani would want us to grow that much.

3327
05:02:53,100 --> 05:02:54,940
And I wouldn't want us to grow that much.

3328
05:02:54,940 --> 05:03:00,060
I like, just being like, small to medium sized.

3329
05:03:00,060 --> 05:03:03,180
Like, if I like, 50,000 people watching me, wait, no,

3330
05:03:03,180 --> 05:03:06,700
how many people do they have watching them most of the time?

3331
05:03:06,700 --> 05:03:08,740
The hollow girls, I don't even know.

3332
05:03:08,740 --> 05:03:10,020
Like, 20k.

3333
05:03:10,020 --> 05:03:12,460
I don't know if I would survive.

3334
05:03:12,460 --> 05:03:14,540
That's a big chat.

3335
05:03:14,540 --> 05:03:16,340
I pride myself on my chat interaction.

3336
05:03:17,340 --> 05:03:24,340
I was freaking out when I had, like, 6k on the debut.

3337
05:03:24,340 --> 05:03:25,340
I was like, wah!

3338
05:03:28,340 --> 05:03:33,340
The most people I'd ever streamed to in my lifetime was 400 before that,

3339
05:03:33,340 --> 05:03:36,340
when I got rated by someone on Twitch.

3340
05:03:47,340 --> 05:03:49,340
Yeah, JP is like 50k.

3341
05:03:52,340 --> 05:03:53,340
Yeah.

3342
05:03:53,340 --> 05:03:58,340
I like, I find, like, I obviously can't control it.

3343
05:04:00,340 --> 05:04:04,340
Like, how we grow as a community and as a company,

3344
05:04:04,340 --> 05:04:07,340
in terms of, like, our concurrent viewership and stuff.

3345
05:04:07,340 --> 05:04:11,340
But I would prefer to be smaller.

3346
05:04:12,340 --> 05:04:16,340
I like how you spelled that J-Pan.

3347
05:04:19,340 --> 05:04:21,340
Oh, Narissa's 3D debuts today?

3348
05:04:21,340 --> 05:04:23,340
I thought it was, um, tomorrow.

3349
05:04:23,340 --> 05:04:26,340
Cause, like, again, time zones.

3350
05:04:27,340 --> 05:04:28,340
Dang it.

3351
05:04:28,340 --> 05:04:31,340
I'm missing the debuts.

3352
05:04:32,340 --> 05:04:34,340
Yeah, I like, smelled it.

3353
05:04:34,340 --> 05:04:36,340
No, why would I ever forget you guys?

3354
05:04:36,340 --> 05:04:37,340
No, don't say that.

3355
05:04:37,340 --> 05:04:39,340
I'm not gonna forget you guys.

3356
05:04:39,340 --> 05:04:41,340
I know, like, some of you guys are like,

3357
05:04:41,340 --> 05:04:44,340
I wanna gatekeep because they'll real forget us

3358
05:04:44,340 --> 05:04:48,340
and you're totally entitled to that, to have that opinion.

3359
05:04:52,340 --> 05:04:54,340
Totally entitled to that.

3360
05:04:54,340 --> 05:04:57,340
But don't think I'll ever, like, forget you guys.

3361
05:04:57,340 --> 05:04:59,340
Like, I'll still see people in my PL

3362
05:04:59,340 --> 05:05:02,340
and I'll be, like, who, like, just stop by to see how I'm doing.

3363
05:05:02,340 --> 05:05:04,340
Like, I might not be their cup of tea now,

3364
05:05:04,340 --> 05:05:06,340
if because, like, I was very, like, I wasn't very,

3365
05:05:06,340 --> 05:05:08,340
but, like, I would say so.

3366
05:05:08,340 --> 05:05:12,340
Um, and it's always nice to see their faces.

3367
05:05:12,340 --> 05:05:15,340
It's like, oh, like, a passing old friend, you know?

3368
05:05:15,340 --> 05:05:18,340
But you guys, you guys will always be there,

3369
05:05:18,340 --> 05:05:20,340
so you will not be an old friend.

3370
05:05:20,340 --> 05:05:22,340
You'll be a current friend.

3371
05:05:22,340 --> 05:05:24,340
I have to toot.

3372
05:05:30,340 --> 05:05:31,340
Damn.

3373
05:05:35,340 --> 05:05:37,340
Say so? Yeah.

3374
05:05:37,340 --> 05:05:39,340
Pretty say so.

3375
05:05:41,340 --> 05:05:43,340
I was pretty...

3376
05:05:43,340 --> 05:05:45,340
People forget that I was cute and funny

3377
05:05:45,340 --> 05:05:47,340
and very say so.

3378
05:05:47,340 --> 05:05:49,340
I would, like, swear, but otherwise,

3379
05:05:49,340 --> 05:05:51,340
I didn't really do anything else.

3380
05:05:53,340 --> 05:05:54,340
I thought they were lewd.

3381
05:05:54,340 --> 05:05:56,340
I know, some people thought I'd be like,

3382
05:05:56,340 --> 05:05:58,340
oh, my God.

3383
05:05:58,340 --> 05:06:00,340
Oh, my God.

3384
05:06:02,340 --> 05:06:04,340
No, I'm not doing that.

3385
05:06:08,340 --> 05:06:11,340
Okay, keep me the farzer of 20k viewers?

3386
05:06:11,340 --> 05:06:13,340
I don't know about that.

3387
05:06:13,340 --> 05:06:17,340
I'm pretty sure Strani's got, like, a short of me

3388
05:06:17,340 --> 05:06:19,340
farting, cooking.

3389
05:06:19,340 --> 05:06:22,340
Cooking in the editor's room.

3390
05:06:26,340 --> 05:06:28,340
I don't even have 1k of those people.

3391
05:06:28,340 --> 05:06:30,340
What, 1k of people wanting me to fart?

3392
05:06:30,340 --> 05:06:32,340
I don't...

3393
05:06:33,340 --> 05:06:35,340
Mer...

3394
05:06:35,340 --> 05:06:37,340
Well, again, as Rina,

3395
05:06:37,340 --> 05:06:39,340
I literally had a non-outfit.

3396
05:06:39,340 --> 05:06:42,340
And I was a Siamese cat priestess.

3397
05:06:42,340 --> 05:06:45,340
The worst I got was towards the end

3398
05:06:45,340 --> 05:06:47,340
when I was about to graduate.

3399
05:06:47,340 --> 05:06:51,340
And because Strani had already sent me my 3DO.

3400
05:06:51,340 --> 05:06:54,340
And so I was using it on stream

3401
05:06:54,340 --> 05:06:56,340
and I was, like, just testing the waters

3402
05:06:56,340 --> 05:06:58,340
about how lewd I could be.

3403
05:06:58,340 --> 05:07:01,340
And I'm like, I'm too...

3404
05:07:01,340 --> 05:07:03,340
It was too powerful.

3405
05:07:05,340 --> 05:07:07,340
And non-outfitters.

3406
05:07:07,340 --> 05:07:09,340
No, I didn't get... What?

3407
05:07:09,340 --> 05:07:11,340
Guys, it was on Twitch.

3408
05:07:11,340 --> 05:07:13,340
It was on Twitch!

3409
05:07:21,340 --> 05:07:23,340
No, I'll probably not be the non again.

3410
05:07:23,340 --> 05:07:27,340
You probably won't be CBB for a very, very, very long time.

3411
05:07:29,340 --> 05:07:31,340
Why are you guys looking at me like that?

3412
05:07:31,340 --> 05:07:34,340
House of Purple. Yes, the House of Purple.

3413
05:07:35,340 --> 05:07:38,340
Sorry, I was calling it, like, instead of, like, red, like, Vermillion.

3414
05:07:38,340 --> 05:07:40,340
Wait, is Vermillion green or red?

3415
05:07:40,340 --> 05:07:42,340
Never get.

3416
05:07:45,340 --> 05:07:47,340
House of Azure.

3417
05:07:47,340 --> 05:07:49,340
Azure. Azure.

3418
05:07:49,340 --> 05:07:51,340
House of Indigo.

3419
05:07:51,340 --> 05:07:53,340
Indigo is more like, purpley.

3420
05:07:53,340 --> 05:07:55,340
I always thought Indigo was blue,

3421
05:07:55,340 --> 05:07:57,340
but I've been told it's actually purple.

3422
05:07:57,340 --> 05:07:59,340
What, you are on Twitch?

3423
05:07:59,340 --> 05:08:01,340
Yes.

3424
05:08:01,340 --> 05:08:03,340
Again, as you have seen from...

3425
05:08:03,340 --> 05:08:07,340
And I've said my past life so many times.

3426
05:08:07,340 --> 05:08:09,340
And people are like, wait, wait.

3427
05:08:09,340 --> 05:08:12,340
But I was a nobody. I literally streamed to, like, 20 people.

3428
05:08:12,340 --> 05:08:14,340
I had less than 1,000 followers.

3429
05:08:14,340 --> 05:08:16,340
I think I was at, like, 800 or...

3430
05:08:16,340 --> 05:08:18,340
I was, like, going to 900.

3431
05:08:21,340 --> 05:08:22,340
Rena, no.

3432
05:08:22,340 --> 05:08:23,340
Rena, no.

3433
05:08:23,340 --> 05:08:24,340
Your favorite...

3434
05:08:24,340 --> 05:08:26,340
Your favorite...

3435
05:08:26,340 --> 05:08:28,340
Hi, everybody.

3436
05:08:33,340 --> 05:08:35,340
I kind of wish you could have heard those...

3437
05:08:35,340 --> 05:08:36,340
Well, sorry.

3438
05:08:36,340 --> 05:08:38,340
You got something better instead.

3439
05:08:38,340 --> 05:08:40,340
Oh, no, not recently.

3440
05:08:40,340 --> 05:08:42,340
No, no, no, I'm at my past life.

3441
05:08:42,340 --> 05:08:44,340
The voice sounds like it hurts to do.

3442
05:08:44,340 --> 05:08:46,340
It doesn't, actually.

3443
05:08:46,340 --> 05:08:51,340
I can maintain the higher pitch voice pretty, pretty well,

3444
05:08:51,340 --> 05:08:53,340
because I would do it for hours.

3445
05:08:53,340 --> 05:08:55,340
That's why people didn't know that I was...

3446
05:08:55,340 --> 05:08:58,340
Like, people thought I was either going to be Emmy or IC.

3447
05:08:59,340 --> 05:09:04,340
Because, like, I had a lot of fun during my streams,

3448
05:09:04,340 --> 05:09:07,340
is I would use my really high-pitched voice and talk like this,

3449
05:09:07,340 --> 05:09:11,340
and then I would switch and drop to the mommy voice

3450
05:09:11,340 --> 05:09:12,340
and be like, hey.

3451
05:09:12,340 --> 05:09:14,340
And then people would be like, oh, my God, what?

3452
05:09:14,340 --> 05:09:15,340
What?

3453
05:09:15,340 --> 05:09:17,340
Mommy voice?

3454
05:09:19,340 --> 05:09:20,340
But, yeah.

3455
05:09:23,340 --> 05:09:25,340
Yeah, I'm just being me.

3456
05:09:25,340 --> 05:09:28,340
Although, I still, again, I've said...

3457
05:09:28,340 --> 05:09:30,340
I do the opposite facts.

3458
05:09:30,340 --> 05:09:35,340
I always say that, like, me and Rena are two sides of the same coin.

3459
05:09:35,340 --> 05:09:38,340
Like, she's my more childish side,

3460
05:09:38,340 --> 05:09:40,340
and she in, like, when I...

3461
05:09:40,340 --> 05:09:42,340
Like, I was way more childish as Rena,

3462
05:09:42,340 --> 05:09:45,340
and more say-so and more, like...

3463
05:09:47,340 --> 05:09:48,340
I don't know.

3464
05:09:49,340 --> 05:09:52,340
Yeah, and then, like, she's kind of like the other side of the coin.

3465
05:09:55,340 --> 05:09:57,340
You personally have pins, will you?

3466
05:09:57,340 --> 05:09:58,340
Yeah.

3467
05:09:58,340 --> 05:10:00,340
A lot of people thought I was going to be Emmy.

3468
05:10:03,340 --> 05:10:05,340
A lot of people didn't know it was me,

3469
05:10:05,340 --> 05:10:08,340
and when they watched me, they're like, that's not her.

3470
05:10:09,340 --> 05:10:11,340
Until I actually came out and said it.

3471
05:10:11,340 --> 05:10:13,340
People were like, nah, nah, nah, that's not her.

3472
05:10:13,340 --> 05:10:15,340
She has to be Emmy, and I'm like...

3473
05:10:15,340 --> 05:10:17,340
Emmy just said she was Liberty, so...

3474
05:10:19,340 --> 05:10:21,340
What are you guys talking about?

3475
05:10:22,340 --> 05:10:23,340
Um...

3476
05:10:23,340 --> 05:10:26,340
Because, again, my voice range...

3477
05:10:30,340 --> 05:10:31,340
A bunny smooch?

3478
05:10:31,340 --> 05:10:34,340
What gives you the right to think you can come in here

3479
05:10:34,340 --> 05:10:36,340
and ask for a smooch, sir?

3480
05:10:36,340 --> 05:10:38,340
We just met. I'm a lady.

3481
05:10:38,340 --> 05:10:40,340
All right, you don't get to waltz up in here

3482
05:10:40,340 --> 05:10:42,340
and be like, can I get a bunny smooch?

3483
05:10:42,340 --> 05:10:43,340
No, huh?

3484
05:10:43,340 --> 05:10:44,340
Mm-mm.

3485
05:10:45,340 --> 05:10:46,340
Yeah, yeah.

3486
05:10:46,340 --> 05:10:49,340
Well, Muppet Sheeby make a comeback in a whole new way.

3487
05:10:49,340 --> 05:10:50,340
You don't even know yet.

3488
05:10:52,340 --> 05:10:54,340
Yeah, everybody, harem, you can smooch.

3489
05:10:54,340 --> 05:10:56,340
Everybody kiss him.

3490
05:10:57,340 --> 05:11:00,340
Harem, mods, kiss that man.

3491
05:11:04,340 --> 05:11:06,340
Doing funny voice to friends.

3492
05:11:06,340 --> 05:11:07,340
Frankly, that was fun.

3493
05:11:07,340 --> 05:11:08,340
It was really fun.

3494
05:11:09,340 --> 05:11:11,340
Can we get some smooches?

3495
05:11:11,340 --> 05:11:12,340
Uh, no.

3496
05:11:13,340 --> 05:11:16,340
Why do you guys think you can get smooches?

3497
05:11:16,340 --> 05:11:17,340
What do you...

3498
05:11:18,340 --> 05:11:20,340
You guys are making demands of your madam.

3499
05:11:21,340 --> 05:11:26,340
Yeah, everybody, smell check.

3500
05:11:26,340 --> 05:11:30,340
I used to have what I wish YouTube had

3501
05:11:30,340 --> 05:11:33,340
and I hope they eventually put in

3502
05:11:33,340 --> 05:11:36,340
is like how there's like channel point stuff

3503
05:11:36,340 --> 05:11:38,340
because I would have channel points

3504
05:11:38,340 --> 05:11:40,340
for people who would like redeem stuff

3505
05:11:40,340 --> 05:11:42,340
and they'd be like, they would dream like an R-R-R.

3506
05:11:42,340 --> 05:11:44,340
So I'd be like, hi, everybody.

3507
05:11:44,340 --> 05:11:45,340
Oh, look, an R-R-R.

3508
05:11:45,340 --> 05:11:46,340
Okay.

3509
05:11:48,340 --> 05:11:49,340
And they'd be like...

3510
05:11:50,340 --> 05:11:51,340
Or I'd be like...

3511
05:11:52,340 --> 05:11:54,340
All right, hey, we're doing this today, blah, blah, blah, blah.

3512
05:11:55,340 --> 05:11:57,340
Oh, somebody redeemed an oo-oo.

3513
05:11:58,340 --> 05:11:59,340
Oo-oo?

3514
05:12:03,340 --> 05:12:05,340
And then I would also have the burp donation.

3515
05:12:05,340 --> 05:12:07,340
So if I burped, I would donate it

3516
05:12:07,340 --> 05:12:09,340
or would dedicate it to somebody.

3517
05:12:09,340 --> 05:12:18,340
Yeah, my R-R-R and that one...

3518
05:12:20,340 --> 05:12:21,340
What's it called?

3519
05:12:21,340 --> 05:12:23,340
That one short was very lackluster.

3520
05:12:23,340 --> 05:12:26,340
A lot of my old content was very lackluster

3521
05:12:26,340 --> 05:12:28,340
because I was new to everything and I was very shy.

3522
05:12:30,340 --> 05:12:32,340
What do you call the channel points though?

3523
05:12:34,340 --> 05:12:35,340
What?

3524
05:12:35,340 --> 05:12:37,340
They just call channel points, I don't know.

3525
05:12:38,340 --> 05:12:39,340
What's channel points?

3526
05:12:39,340 --> 05:12:40,340
Burps and wraps.

3527
05:12:41,340 --> 05:12:42,340
Call me male, neck and neck.

3528
05:12:42,340 --> 05:12:43,340
No.

3529
05:12:44,340 --> 05:12:45,340
Sorry, I make that...

3530
05:12:45,340 --> 05:12:47,340
That's like the second time I've made that joke.

3531
05:12:47,340 --> 05:12:48,340
I'm sorry.

3532
05:12:48,340 --> 05:12:49,340
If you know, you know.

3533
05:12:49,340 --> 05:12:51,340
I'm not her.

3534
05:12:51,340 --> 05:12:53,340
I'm holding up my hand.

3535
05:12:53,340 --> 05:12:54,340
I'm not her.

3536
05:12:55,340 --> 05:12:57,340
It's just a running joke

3537
05:12:57,340 --> 05:12:59,340
because they're a horrible person.

3538
05:13:03,340 --> 05:13:04,340
I wasn't gonna say.

3539
05:13:04,340 --> 05:13:06,340
Can you say that oo-oo again?

3540
05:13:07,340 --> 05:13:08,340
No.

3541
05:13:08,340 --> 05:13:09,340
There you go.

3542
05:13:14,340 --> 05:13:16,340
I believe they applied to Veeler too

3543
05:13:16,340 --> 05:13:17,340
and I'm just like,

3544
05:13:17,340 --> 05:13:19,340
thank god they did not get in.

3545
05:13:21,340 --> 05:13:23,340
If they did, I don't know if they did.

3546
05:13:23,340 --> 05:13:25,340
Maybe last year.

3547
05:13:37,340 --> 05:13:39,340
I got that bass in my chest.

3548
05:13:47,340 --> 05:13:48,340
That's actually hard.

3549
05:13:48,340 --> 05:13:50,340
Redeeming a burp dedication?

3550
05:13:50,340 --> 05:13:52,340
I don't know if I'm gonna burp.

3551
05:13:56,340 --> 05:13:57,340
She got the homie in it.

3552
05:13:59,340 --> 05:14:00,340
I got that brother in me.

3553
05:14:01,340 --> 05:14:02,340
That sounds bad.

3554
05:14:03,340 --> 05:14:05,340
God damn it, she beat me.

3555
05:14:06,340 --> 05:14:07,340
Stop.

3556
05:14:07,340 --> 05:14:08,340
Stop.

3557
05:14:08,340 --> 05:14:09,340
Stop.

3558
05:14:09,340 --> 05:14:10,340
Put the mouse away.

3559
05:14:11,340 --> 05:14:12,340
Stop.

3560
05:14:13,340 --> 05:14:14,340
Enough.

3561
05:14:15,340 --> 05:14:16,340
Don't do that.

3562
05:14:18,340 --> 05:14:20,340
Don't make it weird.

3563
05:14:20,340 --> 05:14:21,340
Stop, bro.

3564
05:14:21,340 --> 05:14:22,340
Stop.

3565
05:14:25,340 --> 05:14:28,340
I wish I had a brother in me.

3566
05:14:28,340 --> 05:14:30,340
I'll put a brother in you.

3567
05:14:33,340 --> 05:14:34,340
Yeah.

3568
05:14:38,340 --> 05:14:40,340
It's just Shabrowski.

3569
05:14:41,340 --> 05:14:43,340
What the heck is on the-

3570
05:14:43,340 --> 05:14:44,340
What is that?

3571
05:14:45,340 --> 05:14:46,340
What is that?

3572
05:14:47,340 --> 05:14:48,340
What is that?

3573
05:14:49,340 --> 05:14:50,340
What is this?

3574
05:14:51,340 --> 05:14:52,340
What is that?

3575
05:14:53,340 --> 05:14:54,340
Oh, it's a kernel.

3576
05:14:54,340 --> 05:14:56,340
Okay, I got really nervous.

3577
05:14:56,340 --> 05:14:59,340
Sorry, something was like wet on the bottom of my

3578
05:14:59,340 --> 05:15:01,340
gamer sub's cup and I was like freaking out

3579
05:15:01,340 --> 05:15:02,340
because I didn't know what it was.

3580
05:15:10,340 --> 05:15:11,340
Stop laughing.

3581
05:15:11,340 --> 05:15:12,340
Shut up.

3582
05:15:12,340 --> 05:15:13,340
All of you, be quiet.

3583
05:15:13,340 --> 05:15:14,340
Hush your mouths.

3584
05:15:16,340 --> 05:15:17,340
He goes, let me check the oven.

3585
05:15:17,340 --> 05:15:18,340
They cut away your brother.

3586
05:15:18,340 --> 05:15:19,340
What?

3587
05:15:25,340 --> 05:15:27,340
Yeah, quiet, quiet, quiet.

3588
05:15:27,340 --> 05:15:28,340
Get stepped on, get stepped on,

3589
05:15:28,340 --> 05:15:29,340
get stepped on, get stepped on.

3590
05:15:29,340 --> 05:15:30,340
Punch the mic.

3591
05:15:30,340 --> 05:15:31,340
Punch the mic.

3592
05:15:31,340 --> 05:15:32,340
Punch the mic.

3593
05:15:43,340 --> 05:15:46,340
Hey, Shibi, where could one get a gamer sub's cup?

3594
05:15:48,340 --> 05:15:50,340
We're 10% off.

3595
05:15:50,340 --> 05:15:53,340
You can get your very own gamer sub's cup

3596
05:15:53,340 --> 05:15:57,340
with Coach Shibi.

3597
05:16:04,340 --> 05:16:05,340
Oh my God.

3598
05:16:07,340 --> 05:16:08,340
I'm not chilling.

3599
05:16:08,340 --> 05:16:09,340
This is part of my job.

3600
05:16:09,340 --> 05:16:10,340
I am a-

3601
05:16:10,340 --> 05:16:11,340
This is their spot.

3602
05:16:11,340 --> 05:16:13,340
I don't know what you expect me to do.

3603
05:16:16,340 --> 05:16:17,340
Jesus Christ.

3604
05:16:18,340 --> 05:16:19,340
You're a link.

3605
05:16:19,340 --> 05:16:20,340
There's a limp-

3606
05:16:20,340 --> 05:16:21,340
A limp?

3607
05:16:21,340 --> 05:16:23,340
I'll link in the description.

3608
05:16:30,340 --> 05:16:33,340
I'm just stepping on you, like just picture me,

3609
05:16:33,340 --> 05:16:36,340
just like stomping on your face and going,

3610
05:16:36,340 --> 05:16:39,340
uh, buy gamer sub's merch.

3611
05:16:39,340 --> 05:16:42,340
Buy gamer sub's cups.

3612
05:16:42,340 --> 05:16:44,340
Buy it all with Coach Shibi,

3613
05:16:44,340 --> 05:16:47,340
or you will be gone from this earth.

3614
05:16:47,340 --> 05:16:49,340
You will no longer exist.

3615
05:16:51,340 --> 05:16:53,340
You will no longer exist.

3616
05:17:05,340 --> 05:17:07,340
I just like looking at your guys reactions.

3617
05:17:07,340 --> 05:17:08,340
This is funny.

3618
05:17:10,340 --> 05:17:11,340
What's the description?

3619
05:17:12,340 --> 05:17:14,340
It's in my YouTube description.

3620
05:17:16,340 --> 05:17:17,340
Yeah, yeah, you know,

3621
05:17:17,340 --> 05:17:20,340
I'm gonna fendom you with my sponsorships.

3622
05:17:22,340 --> 05:17:23,340
Go.

3623
05:17:23,340 --> 05:17:24,340
Now.

3624
05:17:24,340 --> 05:17:26,340
For all of us, actually.

3625
05:17:26,340 --> 05:17:28,340
Cause then we can get a cup.

3626
05:17:28,340 --> 05:17:30,340
Or a flavor.

3627
05:17:31,340 --> 05:17:32,340
Imagine a veal-

3628
05:17:32,340 --> 05:17:37,340
Or the vealer gamer sub's flavor be.

3629
05:17:37,340 --> 05:17:41,340
I'm currently drinking the peach lemonade flavor lean.

3630
05:17:42,340 --> 05:17:44,340
The tracking is so funny.

3631
05:17:44,340 --> 05:17:46,340
Cause you can literally see me drinking.

3632
05:17:59,340 --> 05:18:01,340
Fruit punch the mic.

3633
05:18:01,340 --> 05:18:03,340
That would be my personal flavors.

3634
05:18:03,340 --> 05:18:05,340
Fruit punch the mic.

3635
05:18:05,340 --> 05:18:07,340
Fruit punch the mic.

3636
05:18:10,340 --> 05:18:12,340
Stop drinking me.

3637
05:18:12,340 --> 05:18:14,340
I haven't tried anime thighs yet.

3638
05:18:15,340 --> 05:18:17,340
Vealer be a lemonade flavor.

3639
05:18:17,340 --> 05:18:19,340
I feel like strawberry lemonade.

3640
05:18:20,340 --> 05:18:22,340
Shibi flavor.

3641
05:18:25,340 --> 05:18:26,340
Peeler.

3642
05:18:26,340 --> 05:18:28,340
That's what the name of it would be called.

3643
05:18:29,340 --> 05:18:31,340
Anime thighs like orange creamsicle.

3644
05:18:35,340 --> 05:18:36,340
Peeler.

3645
05:18:42,340 --> 05:18:44,340
Yeah, are you still purring in your sleep?

3646
05:18:45,340 --> 05:18:47,340
She'll like stop and then she'll just like look at me

3647
05:18:47,340 --> 05:18:49,340
and purr and then fall asleep.

3648
05:18:49,340 --> 05:18:51,340
Oh little girl, you're so tired.

3649
05:18:51,340 --> 05:18:53,340
I know I can tell.

3650
05:18:58,340 --> 05:19:00,340
PB&J and apple juice.

3651
05:19:00,340 --> 05:19:02,340
That sounds disgusting as a flavor.

3652
05:19:03,340 --> 05:19:05,340
For a drink?

3653
05:19:08,340 --> 05:19:10,340
Reina's laying on my keyboard.

3654
05:19:13,340 --> 05:19:15,340
I've never really done traditional tabletop stuff.

3655
05:19:17,340 --> 05:19:18,340
Hi Shibi.

3656
05:19:18,340 --> 05:19:20,340
I'd like to thank you for being an inspiration.

3657
05:19:20,340 --> 05:19:22,340
As a result, I've started doming people in the Vealer community discord.

3658
05:19:22,340 --> 05:19:24,340
I learned a little bit.

3659
05:19:28,340 --> 05:19:30,340
One, I'm a terrible person to learn from.

3660
05:19:30,340 --> 05:19:32,340
Two, Reina's still laying on my keyboard.

3661
05:19:32,340 --> 05:19:36,340
Three, why are you doming people in the discord?

3662
05:19:38,340 --> 05:19:40,340
Is that an actual thing?

3663
05:19:41,340 --> 05:19:43,340
What?

3664
05:19:47,340 --> 05:19:50,340
Y'all, what are you?

3665
05:19:51,340 --> 05:19:53,340
I don't even want to know.

3666
05:19:54,340 --> 05:19:55,340
I don't even want to do good.

3667
05:19:55,340 --> 05:19:59,340
So like again, we don't get to see the channel.

3668
05:19:59,340 --> 05:20:02,340
We can't go into it or anything, the channels or the discord.

3669
05:20:02,340 --> 05:20:07,340
Is there like different channels for each talent?

3670
05:20:11,340 --> 05:20:13,340
Is there, is this word?

3671
05:20:13,340 --> 05:20:15,340
And it's like the Shibi channel.

3672
05:20:15,340 --> 05:20:17,340
You guys are just doming each other.

3673
05:20:19,340 --> 05:20:21,340
Do you guys like this talk amongst?

3674
05:20:21,340 --> 05:20:23,340
I thought it was only for announcements.

3675
05:20:24,340 --> 05:20:26,340
Mercy's chat is popping.

3676
05:20:26,340 --> 05:20:27,340
That's good.

3677
05:20:29,340 --> 05:20:31,340
There's a media channel for images.

3678
05:20:31,340 --> 05:20:33,340
You guys better be posting memes in there of me.

3679
05:20:36,340 --> 05:20:38,340
Oh, this is the unofficial community one.

3680
05:20:38,340 --> 05:20:39,340
Oh, okay.

3681
05:20:39,340 --> 05:20:40,340
Okay.

3682
05:20:40,340 --> 05:20:41,340
Okay.

3683
05:20:41,340 --> 05:20:42,340
Okay.

3684
05:20:42,340 --> 05:20:43,340
It's a fan discord.

3685
05:20:43,340 --> 05:20:44,340
Got you.

3686
05:20:44,340 --> 05:20:48,340
Are you guys, are you guys grooming each other?

3687
05:20:48,340 --> 05:20:50,340
Please don't groom each other in the discord.

3688
05:20:50,340 --> 05:20:52,340
Please don't groom each other in the discord.

3689
05:20:55,340 --> 05:20:57,340
You have a, you have a Shibi Pat channel.

3690
05:20:59,340 --> 05:21:00,340
That's kind of cute.

3691
05:21:01,340 --> 05:21:03,340
This is a dedicated Shibi Pat channel.

3692
05:21:03,340 --> 05:21:05,340
It's just gifts of me being having the head pat.

3693
05:21:07,340 --> 05:21:09,340
No, no, only we're supposed to be the grooming.

3694
05:21:09,340 --> 05:21:12,340
You guys can't groom amongst yourselves.

3695
05:21:13,340 --> 05:21:15,340
I'm a very, I'm a jealous dom.

3696
05:21:21,340 --> 05:21:24,340
Fia, why are you looking at your paws so loudly?

3697
05:21:26,340 --> 05:21:27,340
What else is there to do in discord?

3698
05:21:27,340 --> 05:21:28,340
I don't know.

3699
05:21:28,340 --> 05:21:29,340
Talk about how awesome we are.

3700
05:21:29,340 --> 05:21:31,340
Well, Fia, they're so great.

3701
05:21:31,340 --> 05:21:34,340
I watched a stream from Mercy the other day

3702
05:21:34,340 --> 05:21:36,340
and I was laughing so hard.

3703
05:21:36,340 --> 05:21:37,340
Oh, well, that's awesome.

3704
05:21:37,340 --> 05:21:39,340
I was watching this stream from Icy

3705
05:21:39,340 --> 05:21:42,340
and I have such a good time being cozy with her playing brats.

3706
05:21:42,340 --> 05:21:44,340
Well, Stronny's my Oshi.

3707
05:21:44,340 --> 05:21:47,340
I was hanging out with her when she was playing

3708
05:21:48,340 --> 05:21:51,340
insert some game here that she needs to be carried in.

3709
05:22:00,340 --> 05:22:02,340
And then et cetera, et cetera for the other girls.

3710
05:22:07,340 --> 05:22:09,340
She actually watches the streams.

3711
05:22:09,340 --> 05:22:11,340
No way. Of course I watch the streams.

3712
05:22:12,340 --> 05:22:14,340
Well, I watched Shibi stream

3713
05:22:14,340 --> 05:22:16,340
and she measured her cat's pouch.

3714
05:22:17,340 --> 05:22:18,340
Wow.

3715
05:22:22,340 --> 05:22:24,340
Are you doing that a lot on Twitter?

3716
05:22:25,340 --> 05:22:27,340
I don't know. Do you? No.

3717
05:22:32,340 --> 05:22:34,340
Oh my god, have we groomed you to go only like us

3718
05:22:34,340 --> 05:22:35,340
and nobody else?

3719
05:22:41,340 --> 05:22:43,340
You are ours now.

3720
05:22:43,340 --> 05:22:46,180
They were stalker twitters?

3721
05:22:46,180 --> 05:22:47,020
Yeah, of course.

3722
05:22:47,020 --> 05:22:50,300
I usually look at like a lot of people who follow me.

3723
05:22:50,300 --> 05:22:52,900
I'll like say, it looks there at their Twitter for a bit

3724
05:22:52,900 --> 05:22:57,900
and I'll be like, hmm, what do you retweet?

3725
05:22:58,220 --> 05:22:59,060
Oh, I see.

3726
05:23:01,180 --> 05:23:02,020
Yes.

3727
05:23:02,020 --> 05:23:05,840
You guys thought that like it was only Emmy and Mercy

3728
05:23:05,840 --> 05:23:07,180
and maybe I see doing that.

3729
05:23:07,180 --> 05:23:09,420
Nah, bro, I'm there too.

3730
05:23:09,420 --> 05:23:10,260
Hi, CB.

3731
05:23:10,260 --> 05:23:11,260
I'm back from touching grass.

3732
05:23:11,260 --> 05:23:12,580
Glad to see you're still here.

3733
05:23:12,580 --> 05:23:13,820
Yes, hello.

3734
05:23:19,380 --> 05:23:21,180
Also, some of you guys have different names

3735
05:23:21,180 --> 05:23:23,860
to than your YouTube handles.

3736
05:23:23,860 --> 05:23:26,260
Like, I don't really know who's who

3737
05:23:26,260 --> 05:23:28,020
because you guys all have alts

3738
05:23:28,020 --> 05:23:31,140
because you're ashamed to love us, but it's fine.

3739
05:23:32,200 --> 05:23:34,460
We're side, oh, she's, it's fine.

3740
05:23:34,460 --> 05:23:35,300
Whatever.

3741
05:23:36,580 --> 05:23:37,420
Horses.

3742
05:23:38,420 --> 05:23:40,420
What are you doing, boomi?

3743
05:23:42,940 --> 05:23:44,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3744
05:23:44,300 --> 05:23:45,860
Tell it to the judge.

3745
05:23:51,420 --> 05:23:59,940
Yeah, exactly, skill issue.

3746
05:23:59,940 --> 05:24:10,620
Let's see what YouTube would have me

3747
05:24:10,620 --> 05:24:12,780
let more than two emojis.

3748
05:24:12,780 --> 05:24:15,580
That's one membership emotes are for.

3749
05:24:20,660 --> 05:24:22,540
Well, you probably, why does a different language join

3750
05:24:22,540 --> 05:24:24,180
when they not read it?

3751
05:24:24,180 --> 05:24:26,740
Google translate exists, buddy.

3752
05:24:30,860 --> 05:24:32,820
Okay, if you're on main, you're a real one.

3753
05:24:32,820 --> 05:24:37,420
If you have an alt, you will pussy, pussy bitch.

3754
05:24:38,740 --> 05:24:42,340
So I'm gonna say, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

3755
05:24:42,340 --> 05:24:43,780
I need to fix that color on my cheek.

3756
05:24:43,780 --> 05:24:45,700
I don't know why it looks like that.

3757
05:24:45,700 --> 05:24:46,700
I'll do that another time.

3758
05:24:52,380 --> 05:24:53,780
Guess I'm a real one then.

3759
05:24:55,940 --> 05:24:56,980
No, it's for me.

3760
05:24:56,980 --> 05:24:58,020
I think it's funny.

3761
05:24:58,260 --> 05:25:00,660
I've seen people say like, I have to go on an alt

3762
05:25:00,660 --> 05:25:04,620
cause one of my Oshie sees, sees me in another chat.

3763
05:25:05,980 --> 05:25:09,700
And I'm like, damn, you cheating on your wife with me?

3764
05:25:11,060 --> 05:25:12,260
Yikes, bro.

3765
05:25:17,380 --> 05:25:18,500
That one gray harlot.

3766
05:25:18,500 --> 05:25:19,940
I thought that said something else.

3767
05:25:19,940 --> 05:25:22,300
I thought I said that one gay harlot.

3768
05:25:22,300 --> 05:25:24,980
And I'm like, you know what, speak your truth, bro.

3769
05:25:24,980 --> 05:25:26,180
I appreciate you.

3770
05:25:29,020 --> 05:25:29,860
Welcome back.

3771
05:25:37,540 --> 05:25:39,620
You're so real for that, bro.

3772
05:25:39,620 --> 05:25:40,460
Thank you.

3773
05:25:45,020 --> 05:25:46,700
That would be so funny though.

3774
05:25:51,500 --> 05:25:53,460
Booby, what are you doing?

3775
05:25:54,500 --> 05:25:57,260
Why are you trying to shove yourself under the couch?

3776
05:25:58,260 --> 05:26:03,020
I remember someone sitting in the middle of a wheeler.

3777
05:26:03,020 --> 05:26:06,500
I remember the dudes going in the brothel behind the pipes back.

3778
05:26:06,500 --> 05:26:07,340
Oh, God.

3779
05:26:09,900 --> 05:26:11,300
I'm totally main account.

3780
05:26:11,300 --> 05:26:12,580
Oh, yes, of course.

3781
05:26:15,620 --> 05:26:17,460
I lost my shoe and my foot stool.

3782
05:26:17,460 --> 05:26:18,620
I don't know where they went.

3783
05:26:23,380 --> 05:26:25,100
The new mascots are back.

3784
05:26:25,100 --> 05:26:26,420
I'm not sure where they went.

3785
05:26:26,740 --> 05:26:29,700
The new mascots are Boomi and Reina's lawyers.

3786
05:26:31,900 --> 05:26:32,940
Boomi's so delectable.

3787
05:26:32,940 --> 05:26:34,820
Boomi, don't try to hit her.

3788
05:26:36,060 --> 05:26:38,300
He literally just put his paws on the edge of my desk

3789
05:26:38,300 --> 05:26:41,260
because he's tall and he tried to smack Reina.

3790
05:26:42,180 --> 05:26:43,180
Don't worry, Reina, it's just me.

3791
05:26:43,180 --> 05:26:44,420
I'm just tucking in your tail.

3792
05:26:44,420 --> 05:26:45,820
I don't even know how this is comfortable for you.

3793
05:26:45,820 --> 05:26:49,180
She's laying on my GoXLR and my keyboard.

3794
05:26:57,340 --> 05:26:59,820
I swear, you see the shoe once in a blue moon.

3795
05:27:02,540 --> 05:27:03,980
Wasn't there a Count Calcibi's blog?

3796
05:27:03,980 --> 05:27:04,820
Was there?

3797
05:27:04,820 --> 05:27:05,660
Maybe.

3798
05:27:07,860 --> 05:27:09,660
Honestly, I believe people just change their names

3799
05:27:09,660 --> 05:27:11,380
for the memes and then they change it back later.

3800
05:27:11,380 --> 05:27:12,820
And so they're probably still around.

3801
05:27:12,820 --> 05:27:14,900
They're just like under their normal names.

3802
05:27:17,340 --> 05:27:20,300
Trying to think, what else should I address in this stream?

3803
05:27:21,820 --> 05:27:25,940
You're all cowards and bastards.

3804
05:27:27,260 --> 05:27:32,340
I have cotton puffs for hands and I can choose to have knives.

3805
05:27:32,340 --> 05:27:33,540
Instead, what am I?

3806
05:27:33,540 --> 05:27:35,340
The cat answers cats.

3807
05:27:37,340 --> 05:27:40,140
At least you want to let me think about it for a moment.

3808
05:27:41,140 --> 05:27:42,340
Wasn't there a Shibikar?

3809
05:27:42,340 --> 05:27:43,700
Why would there be a Shibikar?

3810
05:27:46,940 --> 05:27:49,140
She lays the swap between accounts.

3811
05:27:49,140 --> 05:27:51,940
Yeah, I have an alt.

3812
05:27:51,940 --> 05:27:52,780
I creep on it.

3813
05:27:53,220 --> 05:27:55,900
Yeah, I have an alt.

3814
05:27:55,900 --> 05:28:00,460
I creep on you guys with, yeah, mm-hmm, yeah.

3815
05:28:02,660 --> 05:28:03,940
So you can write, what?

3816
05:28:07,220 --> 05:28:09,860
Do you have a car?

3817
05:28:09,860 --> 05:28:12,380
Yeah, what do I see?

3818
05:28:17,300 --> 05:28:19,180
I don't know what to tell you, man.

3819
05:28:20,180 --> 05:28:22,340
Hi, I'm Shibi's alt.

3820
05:28:22,340 --> 05:28:23,180
Just boy.

3821
05:28:24,180 --> 05:28:29,180
No, I've actually accidentally posted on my alt while streaming

3822
05:28:29,180 --> 05:28:32,180
when I like walked away to do something and I was like,

3823
05:28:32,180 --> 05:28:34,540
I forgot that I was logged into it and I was like, hey,

3824
05:28:34,540 --> 05:28:36,180
and then I'm like, ah!

3825
05:28:37,180 --> 05:28:41,780
Wait, I'm just like a random gray name.

3826
05:28:41,900 --> 05:28:43,500
I'm just like a random gray name.

3827
05:28:47,500 --> 05:28:50,860
Not that I meant, like it's not like nothing identifiable

3828
05:28:50,860 --> 05:28:51,700
is on it.

3829
05:28:54,740 --> 05:28:57,580
But, but yeah.

3830
05:29:02,660 --> 05:29:04,140
Yeah, nothing, nothing, nothing.

3831
05:29:04,140 --> 05:29:05,580
It's just, it's always an alt that I've had,

3832
05:29:05,580 --> 05:29:09,500
like a, like a, my YouTube account that I've had for years,

3833
05:29:09,500 --> 05:29:11,500
but I never, that I had made when I was like,

3834
05:29:12,780 --> 05:29:14,300
I don't know how.

3835
05:29:16,580 --> 05:29:19,020
Not even, why would I remember to myself?

3836
05:29:19,020 --> 05:29:20,780
Why would I remember myself?

3837
05:29:20,780 --> 05:29:22,660
I am doing the streams.

3838
05:29:25,700 --> 05:29:27,980
She could be any one of us.

3839
05:29:27,980 --> 05:29:29,900
Shibi's a gray name.

3840
05:29:31,180 --> 05:29:32,500
Gifted to yourself?

3841
05:29:34,060 --> 05:29:35,540
Yeah, I would just gift emotes

3842
05:29:35,540 --> 05:29:37,740
and then I would have to pay to do the thing.

3843
05:29:38,740 --> 05:29:40,380
Did you see my own members' streams?

3844
05:29:40,380 --> 05:29:42,340
I need to look at them back.

3845
05:29:42,340 --> 05:29:44,300
From the perspective of a member.

3846
05:29:47,860 --> 05:29:50,660
It's to be fair, Shibi, the value is quite good.

3847
05:29:50,660 --> 05:29:53,780
I would 100% agree with you.

3848
05:29:59,020 --> 05:30:00,540
Paying yourself?

3849
05:30:00,540 --> 05:30:02,540
Yeah, I'm just like, let me,

3850
05:30:02,540 --> 05:30:04,340
I'll write this off as an expense,

3851
05:30:04,340 --> 05:30:06,460
just like paying for my own membership.

3852
05:30:06,460 --> 05:30:08,300
Raina, why are you putting your toe out like that?

3853
05:30:08,300 --> 05:30:09,860
Damn, girl.

3854
05:30:09,860 --> 05:30:10,700
Why are you showing all that?

3855
05:30:10,700 --> 05:30:13,060
Look, I need to take a picture of Raina for you guys.

3856
05:30:14,140 --> 05:30:16,500
I'm gonna go, vent your little quest for a second.

3857
05:30:17,700 --> 05:30:20,620
Damn, girl, why are you sitting like that?

3858
05:30:24,140 --> 05:30:27,220
Why are you sitting like that with your leg out?

3859
05:30:32,660 --> 05:30:35,180
You guys ain't ready, she's showing some leg.

3860
05:30:35,180 --> 05:30:36,780
I'll post that after stream.

3861
05:30:52,460 --> 05:30:54,980
Yeah, I could be that one gray harlot right now.

3862
05:30:54,980 --> 05:30:56,260
You guys don't even know.

3863
05:30:58,980 --> 05:31:00,580
Infinite money glitch.

3864
05:31:05,580 --> 05:31:08,140
No, I was actually signed into the right account,

3865
05:31:08,140 --> 05:31:10,540
but I still couldn't see the members chat.

3866
05:31:11,540 --> 05:31:13,900
It was a weird glitch that day,

3867
05:31:13,900 --> 05:31:15,700
because it was, whoa, whoa, Raina,

3868
05:31:15,700 --> 05:31:19,900
you're messing up the view of my screen.

3869
05:31:23,220 --> 05:31:24,700
Viewers are joking about the streamer

3870
05:31:24,700 --> 05:31:27,900
possibly having multiple accounts being in her own chat.

3871
05:31:27,900 --> 05:31:30,940
They're also wondering, I will never know,

3872
05:31:30,940 --> 05:31:33,260
because they only have one account.

3873
05:31:33,580 --> 05:31:34,420
I will never know,

3874
05:31:34,420 --> 05:31:36,740
because they only show you it for five seconds,

3875
05:31:36,740 --> 05:31:37,700
the stupid thing.

3876
05:31:39,740 --> 05:31:44,220
Raina's making the thing zoom in out every time I scroll,

3877
05:31:44,220 --> 05:31:46,020
because she's laying on my keyboard.

3878
05:31:48,940 --> 05:31:51,340
No, no, the on-brand name would be,

3879
05:31:51,340 --> 05:31:52,940
would be that one gay harlot.

3880
05:31:56,740 --> 05:31:59,340
She views Boomi's lawyer, yeah, definitely.

3881
05:32:01,620 --> 05:32:02,780
Is her right?

3882
05:32:04,260 --> 05:32:07,420
The AI suspension is all, does it really?

3883
05:32:10,300 --> 05:32:11,140
What?

3884
05:32:13,660 --> 05:32:14,860
Yeah, I'm tired of Google.

3885
05:32:14,860 --> 05:32:18,140
I wish I could turn off the Google AI thing.

3886
05:32:18,140 --> 05:32:20,860
Raina, I can't get over your toes,

3887
05:32:20,860 --> 05:32:22,180
just being out like that.

3888
05:32:22,180 --> 05:32:24,900
It's so funny, the cats have four toes on their back paws,

3889
05:32:24,900 --> 05:32:26,540
but five toes on their front paws.

3890
05:32:26,540 --> 05:32:27,740
I don't know why that is.

3891
05:32:28,820 --> 05:32:30,140
Notice anything different?

3892
05:32:31,300 --> 05:32:32,140
Oh no.

3893
05:32:33,860 --> 05:32:34,700
No.

3894
05:32:37,420 --> 05:32:40,460
Playing among us on the couch, she views all.

3895
05:32:43,700 --> 05:32:44,540
No.

3896
05:32:46,260 --> 05:32:48,140
Man, did you hear about the one cartilage

3897
05:32:48,140 --> 05:32:49,420
of the first on our class?

3898
05:32:49,420 --> 05:32:51,060
What are you talking about?

3899
05:32:54,460 --> 05:32:58,060
Except to this fate, that was pretty quick, I'm impressed.

3900
05:32:58,060 --> 05:33:00,100
I was, that was pretty quick.

3901
05:33:00,100 --> 05:33:02,740
Is the AI gonna say something about a gay harlot now?

3902
05:33:04,260 --> 05:33:06,900
Is that, is that what's gonna happen?

3903
05:33:13,780 --> 05:33:15,820
Can't change that for two weeks.

3904
05:33:15,820 --> 05:33:17,340
You're trapped.

3905
05:33:17,340 --> 05:33:18,660
Good thing it's your alt.

3906
05:33:22,140 --> 05:33:25,300
I would, it would just be like wild to me if like,

3907
05:33:27,100 --> 05:33:32,100
if like there's some like popular streamers or VTubers

3908
05:33:32,940 --> 05:33:36,060
out there that like make an alt to watch us.

3909
05:33:38,220 --> 05:33:40,460
And like, I could just have a straight up,

3910
05:33:40,460 --> 05:33:45,340
just like, all alive, member in my chat.

3911
05:33:45,340 --> 05:33:46,780
And I just don't know it.

3912
05:33:53,060 --> 05:33:55,900
I forgot to kick every two weeks.

3913
05:34:02,980 --> 05:34:06,180
Guys, I'm actually a little worried.

3914
05:34:06,180 --> 05:34:07,420
I will lose my mind.

3915
05:34:16,260 --> 05:34:21,100
Oh wait, that's, I'm not that, I didn't know who that was.

3916
05:34:21,100 --> 05:34:22,300
No, the chat is blue.

3917
05:34:24,460 --> 05:34:26,300
You're like, oh, I've heard of you.

3918
05:34:27,380 --> 05:34:28,220
I hope because.

3919
05:34:32,380 --> 05:34:37,980
I would, I would, yeah, I'd lose my mind.

3920
05:34:39,020 --> 05:34:42,220
I need to, I need to find more people to read too.

3921
05:34:42,220 --> 05:34:44,140
I need to, I realize I like was,

3922
05:34:44,140 --> 05:34:47,620
I watch a lot of YouTubers or I like,

3923
05:34:47,620 --> 05:34:50,740
at least I try to, I'll jump through chat to chat and all

3924
05:34:50,740 --> 05:34:53,260
and stuff and just kind of see the vibes.

3925
05:34:53,260 --> 05:34:56,260
And I was like, wait, why am I not subscribed to this person?

3926
05:34:58,820 --> 05:34:59,660
He'll tell.

3927
05:35:02,100 --> 05:35:02,940
He'll tell.

3928
05:35:11,620 --> 05:35:15,140
No, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna raid hollow live.

3929
05:35:15,140 --> 05:35:17,180
Do you think I'm crazy?

3930
05:35:18,100 --> 05:35:18,940
I'm Yaku.

3931
05:35:24,820 --> 05:35:26,100
Yes.

3932
05:35:26,100 --> 05:35:27,020
No.

3933
05:35:28,540 --> 05:35:30,620
That one time I raided Pippa

3934
05:35:30,620 --> 05:35:32,540
because I didn't have anybody else.

3935
05:35:36,020 --> 05:35:38,540
I was feeling, I was feeling wild that day.

3936
05:35:38,540 --> 05:35:41,460
All right, thank you for the Tony gifted.

3937
05:35:41,460 --> 05:35:44,780
I don't think it's gonna hit that one girl.

3938
05:35:44,780 --> 05:35:46,260
Wait, did it?

3939
05:35:46,260 --> 05:35:47,100
Oh my God.

3940
05:35:47,100 --> 05:35:47,940
He got.

3941
05:35:54,940 --> 05:35:55,780
Oh my God.

3942
05:35:55,900 --> 05:35:56,740
God.

3943
05:35:59,420 --> 05:36:00,260
Raiden, Arissa.

3944
05:36:00,260 --> 05:36:01,100
No, thank you.

3945
05:36:01,100 --> 05:36:04,100
I would, I would, I'm too shy.

3946
05:36:04,100 --> 05:36:05,180
Oh my God.

3947
05:36:05,180 --> 05:36:06,020
We broke the AI.

3948
05:36:06,020 --> 05:36:06,860
Hold on.

3949
05:36:08,940 --> 05:36:11,380
That is so funny to me.

3950
05:36:14,220 --> 05:36:16,220
Viewers are joking around about a streamer accidentally

3951
05:36:16,220 --> 05:36:17,620
changing his name to gay harlot

3952
05:36:17,620 --> 05:36:19,940
and speculating how hollow life would react

3953
05:36:19,940 --> 05:36:21,140
if he raided them.

3954
05:36:21,900 --> 05:36:26,900
Oh, thank you for the, thank you for the gifted.

3955
05:36:28,420 --> 05:36:29,940
Oh my God.

3956
05:36:34,500 --> 05:36:35,340
He got it.

3957
05:36:35,340 --> 05:36:37,700
That's so funny to me.

3958
05:36:40,260 --> 05:36:42,740
Tog, it's called Tog.

3959
05:36:44,100 --> 05:36:44,940
Togs.

3960
05:36:47,060 --> 05:36:47,900
Hi, Fia.

3961
05:36:51,620 --> 05:36:54,700
That is so funny that that happened.

3962
05:36:58,220 --> 05:36:59,260
Okay.

3963
05:36:59,260 --> 05:37:02,940
Let me find some peeps to raid.

3964
05:37:04,980 --> 05:37:07,860
Give me some suggestions of people I should follow.

3965
05:37:18,060 --> 05:37:18,900
La, la, la.

3966
05:37:21,900 --> 05:37:26,940
Wait, I'm going to subscribe to people after stream

3967
05:37:26,940 --> 05:37:28,900
because I don't like my name popping up.

3968
05:37:30,900 --> 05:37:33,060
I think I'm already subscribed to her.

3969
05:37:35,060 --> 05:37:35,900
Siren arrows.

3970
05:37:35,900 --> 05:37:37,260
I do not know who that is.

3971
05:37:37,260 --> 05:37:38,460
Where's Siren arrows from?

3972
05:37:38,460 --> 05:37:41,900
I already follow and subscribe to mutuals of mono.

3973
05:37:44,980 --> 05:37:46,300
I am shy.

3974
05:37:46,300 --> 05:37:47,300
Bob Ross is streaming?

3975
05:37:47,300 --> 05:37:48,620
No freaking way.

3976
05:37:49,060 --> 05:37:53,100
Haram, not harem, haram.

3977
05:37:56,100 --> 05:37:59,340
What you got to lose, Nini Amano?

3978
05:37:59,340 --> 05:38:00,180
No.

3979
05:38:02,740 --> 05:38:04,060
Oh my gosh.

3980
05:38:04,060 --> 05:38:07,300
I just didn't pass the stream in 12 hours.

3981
05:38:07,300 --> 05:38:11,700
Nini Amano, I would, I'm so scared about raiding people

3982
05:38:11,700 --> 05:38:14,340
who are like, I don't even know what to do with them.

3983
05:38:14,340 --> 05:38:16,340
I don't even know what to do with them.

3984
05:38:16,340 --> 05:38:19,780
I'm so scared about raiding people who are like very say so

3985
05:38:19,780 --> 05:38:21,420
because I don't want to like offend them

3986
05:38:21,420 --> 05:38:24,940
or like make their fan bases feel a certain way.

3987
05:38:25,980 --> 05:38:30,980
I am very, like, I try to be as respectful as possible.

3988
05:38:41,500 --> 05:38:43,700
Could be worse than do that toky clip too.

3989
05:38:46,340 --> 05:38:49,740
Cause I like, I get hurt very easily

3990
05:38:49,740 --> 05:38:52,140
when it comes to that sort of stuff.

3991
05:38:52,140 --> 05:38:54,300
Rage yourself, see you tomorrow.

3992
05:38:57,700 --> 05:39:01,540
Like, I don't worry about like the public's

3993
05:39:01,540 --> 05:39:02,820
negative opinion of me.

3994
05:39:02,820 --> 05:39:06,060
I worry about other agency vTubers

3995
05:39:06,060 --> 05:39:07,900
cause I'm trying to set a good example

3996
05:39:07,900 --> 05:39:09,980
that like Vee-ler is still a great company

3997
05:39:09,980 --> 05:39:11,420
despite the content that we make

3998
05:39:11,420 --> 05:39:15,100
cause people, you know, have negative stuff about that.

3999
05:39:15,100 --> 05:39:17,140
But, so I try to just be respectful

4000
05:39:17,140 --> 05:39:20,660
and respect people's, you know, space and stuff

4001
05:39:20,660 --> 05:39:22,300
if they don't want to interact with me

4002
05:39:22,300 --> 05:39:23,660
because of what I do.

4003
05:39:26,340 --> 05:39:29,380
But yeah, raiding into someone is a compliment.

4004
05:39:32,140 --> 05:39:33,860
Thank you.

4005
05:39:33,860 --> 05:39:38,860
I just, again, I'm, and then like my gen mates outfits

4006
05:39:40,220 --> 05:39:43,860
besides like Azura's are like probably,

4007
05:39:44,780 --> 05:39:46,020
they're pretty normal.

4008
05:39:46,020 --> 05:39:49,020
So like sometimes I get self conscious

4009
05:39:49,020 --> 05:39:52,780
cause my ball gag is out and it'd be like,

4010
05:39:52,780 --> 05:39:53,900
hi, I just raided you

4011
05:39:53,900 --> 05:39:55,980
and I'm just like funny dominatrix.

4012
05:39:57,820 --> 05:40:00,580
So like, that's why like on the stream of Para

4013
05:40:00,580 --> 05:40:01,660
cause I know she's just like,

4014
05:40:01,660 --> 05:40:05,500
hey, can we like do just like not anything sexual

4015
05:40:05,500 --> 05:40:06,340
for ASMR?

4016
05:40:06,340 --> 05:40:09,340
I'm like, I wasn't planning to, but okay.

4017
05:40:09,340 --> 05:40:10,740
I was wearing a different outfit

4018
05:40:10,740 --> 05:40:12,940
cause I wanted to make her feel comfortable.

4019
05:40:14,860 --> 05:40:19,540
Oh, or if I get written to my Christian VTB.

4020
05:40:19,540 --> 05:40:22,100
He's like, yeah, no, we haven't done anything bad.

4021
05:40:22,100 --> 05:40:23,860
It's like, it's not, I'm not saying like,

4022
05:40:23,860 --> 05:40:26,100
oh, we're doing bad things or whatever.

4023
05:40:26,100 --> 05:40:29,220
Or people probably don't think that we're bad.

4024
05:40:29,220 --> 05:40:32,660
It's just like they have this sort of standard.

4025
05:40:32,660 --> 05:40:36,300
And so I'm very cautious about interacting with people

4026
05:40:36,300 --> 05:40:39,500
cause I would hate for them to feel negatively

4027
05:40:39,500 --> 05:40:43,380
cause I struggle with, oh, Marina just set up my keyboard.

4028
05:40:43,420 --> 05:40:44,940
Oh, did you mute me?

4029
05:40:46,740 --> 05:40:47,580
No?

4030
05:40:47,580 --> 05:40:49,240
Okay, you're laying on everything.

4031
05:40:52,340 --> 05:40:53,180
Why'd you?

4032
05:40:54,420 --> 05:40:55,820
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

4033
05:40:55,820 --> 05:40:58,940
I'm just moving cause you just opened audacity for no reason.

4034
05:41:03,420 --> 05:41:07,540
Cause again, like I don't see like collabing and stuff

4035
05:41:07,540 --> 05:41:09,940
as like business relationships.

4036
05:41:09,940 --> 05:41:12,780
I see them as like, if someone wants to collab with me,

4037
05:41:13,780 --> 05:41:15,460
like I only collab with people

4038
05:41:15,460 --> 05:41:17,060
that I want to form a friendship with.

4039
05:41:17,060 --> 05:41:19,800
I don't really care how big or small you are.

4040
05:41:21,460 --> 05:41:26,180
But if someone was just like,

4041
05:41:26,180 --> 05:41:28,460
just never wanted to talk to me again after a thing,

4042
05:41:28,460 --> 05:41:31,180
I'd be like, cause that is how I am.

4043
05:41:31,180 --> 05:41:34,540
Cause I want to be like, no, I'm a good person, but you can't.

4044
05:41:34,540 --> 05:41:35,780
Like you always have to remember,

4045
05:41:35,780 --> 05:41:37,180
you can't please everybody.

4046
05:41:37,180 --> 05:41:41,020
So, I miss Razzia.

4047
05:41:43,780 --> 05:41:45,860
Quick, Marina hit the torque taco.

4048
05:41:47,740 --> 05:41:49,780
Yeah, Amy's Razz got a strength.

4049
05:41:49,780 --> 05:41:51,420
I tried to be a sweetheart.

4050
05:41:51,420 --> 05:41:53,940
I tried to set a good example

4051
05:41:53,940 --> 05:41:56,860
cause I've had people say like they're intimidated by me

4052
05:41:56,860 --> 05:41:58,780
and that makes me very sad.

4053
05:42:00,500 --> 05:42:02,580
Cause I don't know how am I intimidating?

4054
05:42:04,620 --> 05:42:07,300
But then I guess, yeah.

4055
05:42:07,300 --> 05:42:08,940
And then a lot of people have like,

4056
05:42:08,940 --> 05:42:11,980
assumed that since I'm the Dom that like,

4057
05:42:12,020 --> 05:42:13,580
I'm just going to be a hard ass.

4058
05:42:18,580 --> 05:42:23,580
I am a sweet dork, but, you know, people,

4059
05:42:25,300 --> 05:42:30,300
people kind of form their own opinion and stuff

4060
05:42:31,900 --> 05:42:33,300
before they give me a chance.

4061
05:42:33,300 --> 05:42:35,540
So it makes me sad.

4062
05:42:35,540 --> 05:42:37,100
They're like, oh, she's a Dom.

4063
05:42:38,260 --> 05:42:39,860
Nah, dropped.

4064
05:42:39,860 --> 05:42:42,700
Oh, she dressed like this, nah, dropped.

4065
05:42:42,700 --> 05:42:44,980
Oh, she's like the, nah, dropped.

4066
05:42:44,980 --> 05:42:47,700
And I'm just like, get me a chance.

4067
05:42:47,700 --> 05:42:49,700
Let's talk to me, I'm pretty cool.

4068
05:42:56,100 --> 05:42:57,340
Yeah.

4069
05:42:57,340 --> 05:42:59,700
And so I try my best, but again,

4070
05:43:02,660 --> 05:43:04,660
the boomer is a plus.

4071
05:43:04,660 --> 05:43:05,820
She's a whore.

4072
05:43:05,820 --> 05:43:07,780
That like, oh my God.

4073
05:43:07,780 --> 05:43:08,620
What was it?

4074
05:43:08,740 --> 05:43:11,380
I remember my stream of para,

4075
05:43:11,380 --> 05:43:13,220
which I might upload to like,

4076
05:43:15,260 --> 05:43:16,180
if he is snoring,

4077
05:43:18,020 --> 05:43:20,060
I might upload to like, Fandly or something.

4078
05:43:20,060 --> 05:43:22,300
I don't know, or like, Patreon.

4079
05:43:23,540 --> 05:43:27,500
She's just, she's like, dead, like point blank ask me.

4080
05:43:27,500 --> 05:43:30,140
She's like, so how do your parents feel

4081
05:43:30,140 --> 05:43:31,220
about you being a whore?

4082
05:43:31,220 --> 05:43:34,140
And I'm just, and I just lost it

4083
05:43:34,140 --> 05:43:37,140
cause it was the funniest question I ever heard.

4084
05:43:37,140 --> 05:43:42,140
But like, but yeah, no, para told me she was just like,

4085
05:43:42,220 --> 05:43:44,140
you know, you're actually really cool.

4086
05:43:44,140 --> 05:43:46,420
Like I thought you were going to be a certain way,

4087
05:43:46,420 --> 05:43:50,100
like super sexual or super this or super that.

4088
05:43:51,940 --> 05:43:54,820
And it's funny because para knew me in my past lives,

4089
05:43:54,820 --> 05:43:58,900
but she, again, like when you take on a new IP,

4090
05:43:58,900 --> 05:44:00,740
you try to embody the character.

4091
05:44:00,740 --> 05:44:04,060
So I think she was worried I would have changed a little bit.

4092
05:44:04,060 --> 05:44:06,020
And then she's like, this is really awesome.

4093
05:44:06,020 --> 05:44:07,780
Like, I'm like, you're really cool.

4094
05:44:07,780 --> 05:44:10,540
And I'm like, thank you, I'm, yeah.

4095
05:44:10,540 --> 05:44:11,820
That was a funny collab.

4096
05:44:13,900 --> 05:44:14,820
Para had no filter,

4097
05:44:14,820 --> 05:44:17,340
but that's just her culture in the French.

4098
05:44:17,340 --> 05:44:21,660
Yeah, but she was, yeah,

4099
05:44:21,660 --> 05:44:24,460
she was, she was really fun to hang out with.

4100
05:44:27,140 --> 05:44:30,700
But yeah, I just, I just want people to find me approachable.

4101
05:44:31,860 --> 05:44:35,780
That's why, yeah, I was pretty say so.

4102
05:44:35,780 --> 05:44:38,140
And it's funny cause like, I would be very say so

4103
05:44:38,140 --> 05:44:41,820
in some streams, like Toma will all do me sometimes.

4104
05:44:41,820 --> 05:44:46,820
And you also want to self print before that.

4105
05:44:49,060 --> 05:44:52,100
And cause like, I choose my moments

4106
05:44:52,100 --> 05:44:53,900
and to like bring it out, you know?

4107
05:44:55,980 --> 05:44:57,300
You changed me, yeah.

4108
05:45:02,620 --> 05:45:03,460
Toma's so.

4109
05:45:06,620 --> 05:45:11,620
But like, yeah, I'm pretty, pretty normal.

4110
05:45:12,260 --> 05:45:14,780
Like I have my days.

4111
05:45:14,780 --> 05:45:16,580
And then I also just get worried about what I can

4112
05:45:16,580 --> 05:45:17,540
and cannot say on YouTube.

4113
05:45:17,540 --> 05:45:21,020
So I definitely like hold stuff in a lot.

4114
05:45:21,020 --> 05:45:23,900
Like if it was, if it was Twitch,

4115
05:45:23,900 --> 05:45:27,340
I probably wouldn't care as much or like kick.

4116
05:45:28,860 --> 05:45:30,620
Just Toma brought the shit puppet.

4117
05:45:36,780 --> 05:45:41,500
I'm just not surprised, but yeah.

4118
05:45:41,500 --> 05:45:44,060
Yeah, but I always say, hi streamer.

4119
05:45:44,060 --> 05:45:47,020
If you're a Vtuber who wants to collab with me

4120
05:45:47,020 --> 05:45:48,420
and you're interested in hanging out

4121
05:45:48,420 --> 05:45:50,900
with the girls from VLR, I do not bite.

4122
05:45:50,900 --> 05:45:52,980
I will respect you if you're say so.

4123
05:45:52,980 --> 05:45:54,980
I am very nice and sweet.

4124
05:45:54,980 --> 05:45:56,900
If you want to play a certain game, sure.

4125
05:45:56,900 --> 05:45:58,540
If you want to avoid certain games, sure.

4126
05:45:58,540 --> 05:46:00,620
If you want to do a certain topic, sure.

4127
05:46:00,620 --> 05:46:02,300
I will do whatever makes you feel comfortable

4128
05:46:02,300 --> 05:46:03,980
cause I'm just here to make friends

4129
05:46:03,980 --> 05:46:05,340
and make everybody happy.

4130
05:46:06,780 --> 05:46:11,100
So I hope you would consider collabing with me.

4131
05:46:11,980 --> 05:46:13,140
She be for president.

4132
05:46:13,140 --> 05:46:16,900
She be doing a short about that topic.

4133
05:46:16,900 --> 05:46:18,060
That'd be cool.

4134
05:46:18,060 --> 05:46:18,900
Kick is a danger.

4135
05:46:18,900 --> 05:46:21,220
Yeah, no, you will not catch me on kick.

4136
05:46:21,220 --> 05:46:22,060
I'll have a good night.

4137
05:46:22,060 --> 05:46:23,740
Bye bye.

4138
05:46:23,740 --> 05:46:24,620
Got my vote.

4139
05:46:26,340 --> 05:46:27,180
Yeah, that's true.

4140
05:46:27,180 --> 05:46:28,420
That's another reason why we're not on Twitch

4141
05:46:28,420 --> 05:46:30,740
is like sometimes you can just get banned for any reason.

4142
05:46:30,740 --> 05:46:32,260
But YouTube is like that now too.

4143
05:46:32,260 --> 05:46:35,580
Like Emmy could have just gotten her account removed

4144
05:46:35,580 --> 05:46:37,220
instead of getting a strike.

4145
05:46:37,220 --> 05:46:38,940
Just like some other VTubers I've seen,

4146
05:46:38,940 --> 05:46:40,500
they just have had their accounts just

4147
05:46:40,500 --> 05:46:42,620
yoinked off the face of the earth,

4148
05:46:42,620 --> 05:46:43,820
which is really sad.

4149
05:46:43,820 --> 05:46:46,460
So like strikes don't really mean anything anymore.

4150
05:46:46,460 --> 05:46:49,740
It's just warnings and they just tell you to keep off.

4151
05:46:49,740 --> 05:46:51,340
But they can just ban you for no reason

4152
05:46:51,340 --> 05:46:52,820
on YouTube and Twitch now.

4153
05:46:53,900 --> 05:46:56,420
Or like for made up reasons.

4154
05:46:56,420 --> 05:46:59,880
Like when your rats sniff into a mic, question mark.

4155
05:47:01,100 --> 05:47:03,380
Yeah, I've seen what happened with the VTuber clippers too,

4156
05:47:03,380 --> 05:47:04,380
which makes me really sad

4157
05:47:04,380 --> 05:47:07,660
because VTuber community thrives off of clipping channels.

4158
05:47:07,660 --> 05:47:11,060
Clipping is so integral to VTubing.

4159
05:47:11,060 --> 05:47:16,060
Like we would not have the audience that we do

4160
05:47:16,060 --> 05:47:18,660
without clippers.

4161
05:47:18,660 --> 05:47:20,940
When I say we, I mean like all VTubers.

4162
05:47:22,580 --> 05:47:23,420
Yeah, sniffing.

4163
05:47:23,420 --> 05:47:25,480
Yeah, that's the reason why.

4164
05:47:28,280 --> 05:47:30,400
Yeah, like I am like really sad

4165
05:47:30,400 --> 05:47:33,080
that Emmy can't stream right now.

4166
05:47:34,080 --> 05:47:35,520
Yeah, the shyly one.

4167
05:47:35,520 --> 05:47:37,040
But like that's with someone,

4168
05:47:37,040 --> 05:47:40,840
but that's cause possibly it could be the reason

4169
05:47:40,840 --> 05:47:44,240
because shyly has a lot of pull being large creator.

4170
05:47:45,880 --> 05:47:47,800
But like a smaller clipper channel

4171
05:47:47,800 --> 05:47:50,320
might not get that luxury, you know?

4172
05:47:50,320 --> 05:47:52,380
When this is like a fan clipping channel.

4173
05:47:56,600 --> 05:47:57,440
Wait.

4174
05:47:58,440 --> 05:48:04,200
Trani says I have my clothes shirt toggle.

4175
05:48:04,200 --> 05:48:05,040
What?

4176
05:48:05,040 --> 05:48:08,280
I don't, it must be, is the toggle hiding?

4177
05:48:10,320 --> 05:48:12,320
I did not see the toggle.

4178
05:48:17,320 --> 05:48:18,440
Hold on.

4179
05:48:18,440 --> 05:48:19,960
Hotkey action.

4180
05:48:28,440 --> 05:48:31,200
Yeah, no, it's not in there.

4181
05:48:42,960 --> 05:48:45,240
Let me look through the model files again

4182
05:48:45,240 --> 05:48:46,560
because that's so weird.

4183
05:48:46,560 --> 05:48:50,640
She said that the art, they sent it.

4184
05:48:50,640 --> 05:48:52,240
I don't think so.

4185
05:48:57,800 --> 05:49:00,600
Cause that would be a lot easier on me

4186
05:49:00,600 --> 05:49:05,160
and a manager who makes my thumbnails

4187
05:49:05,160 --> 05:49:09,000
cause we just have to smack like sensors over everything.

4188
05:49:09,960 --> 05:49:11,360
Cause I know the other girls,

4189
05:49:11,360 --> 05:49:13,680
I know like I think Mercy is getting one too

4190
05:49:13,680 --> 05:49:15,200
that we can toggle on and off.

4191
05:49:19,280 --> 05:49:22,240
Oops, that's not what I wanted to do.

4192
05:49:22,240 --> 05:49:23,200
Where is it?

4193
05:49:27,680 --> 05:49:29,520
Yeah, no, but it's not there.

4194
05:49:33,960 --> 05:49:34,800
Weird.

4195
05:49:37,560 --> 05:49:39,160
She is snoring is so cute.

4196
05:49:47,720 --> 05:49:49,400
I'm glad I got that email.

4197
05:49:49,400 --> 05:49:50,880
I'm glad I got that email.

4198
05:49:50,880 --> 05:49:52,720
I'm glad I got that email.

4199
05:49:52,720 --> 05:49:54,200
I'm glad I got that email.

4200
05:49:54,200 --> 05:49:56,040
I'm glad I got that email.

4201
05:49:56,040 --> 05:49:57,440
I'm glad I got that email.

4202
05:49:59,040 --> 05:50:00,160
We are watching.

4203
05:50:09,000 --> 05:50:10,400
You may perceive.

4204
05:50:12,480 --> 05:50:13,320
Oh, I'm small.

4205
05:50:14,800 --> 05:50:16,560
Sometimes I like scroll wrong

4206
05:50:16,560 --> 05:50:18,000
cause I'm on the wrong page.

4207
05:50:21,920 --> 05:50:24,640
Okay, let me, I'm gonna find someone to read

4208
05:50:24,640 --> 05:50:26,320
cause I'm getting real hippie.

4209
05:50:30,240 --> 05:50:31,080
What's today?

4210
05:50:32,160 --> 05:50:33,520
Is Mercy streaming?

4211
05:50:38,200 --> 05:50:40,360
Is Mercy streaming?

4212
05:50:41,880 --> 05:50:42,960
I don't know.

4213
05:50:44,160 --> 05:50:45,760
No, oh, Mercy's away.

4214
05:50:45,760 --> 05:50:48,160
That's right, she's on vacation.

4215
05:50:49,440 --> 05:50:51,480
Our discord has been really quiet

4216
05:50:51,480 --> 05:50:54,600
and I'm like bummed out cause everybody's busy.

4217
05:50:54,920 --> 05:50:57,960
Cause like, Amy's with her cousin.

4218
05:50:57,960 --> 05:51:00,640
Mercy's on vacation.

4219
05:51:00,640 --> 05:51:02,240
Azura's not feeling well.

4220
05:51:02,240 --> 05:51:04,000
So send Azura lots of love.

4221
05:51:06,040 --> 05:51:09,520
And then it's just me strutting and I see it.

4222
05:51:09,520 --> 05:51:11,560
I see it in a different time zone.

4223
05:51:12,720 --> 05:51:13,840
And so I'm just like, oh.

4224
05:51:16,320 --> 05:51:17,640
How could you remind the sun pies?

4225
05:51:17,640 --> 05:51:19,120
They were so pretty.

4226
05:51:19,120 --> 05:51:21,160
I'm sorry.

4227
05:51:21,160 --> 05:51:22,560
I'm sorry, sun pies.

4228
05:51:22,560 --> 05:51:23,840
She'll be back.

4229
05:51:24,600 --> 05:51:25,680
She'll be back.

4230
05:51:34,280 --> 05:51:36,280
Slip, it's clutching me here right now.

4231
05:51:41,240 --> 05:51:44,480
All right, find me a person that's streaming right now

4232
05:51:44,480 --> 05:51:45,520
and I'll read them.

4233
05:51:51,800 --> 05:51:52,840
I'll do it.

4234
05:51:53,680 --> 05:51:55,840
I'll do it.

4235
05:51:55,840 --> 05:51:56,680
Ooh.

4236
05:52:05,200 --> 05:52:07,360
Mama Monay, is she streaming?

4237
05:52:07,360 --> 05:52:08,200
No, she's not.

4238
05:52:13,800 --> 05:52:14,840
Rain is streaming.

4239
05:52:16,080 --> 05:52:18,400
I'm not gonna raid Mercy guys.

4240
05:52:18,400 --> 05:52:22,200
Do you want me to like explode?

4241
05:52:23,080 --> 05:52:28,240
You guys, no, I'm not.

4242
05:52:34,440 --> 05:52:37,240
Find a live bunny wildlife.

4243
05:52:37,240 --> 05:52:42,000
Yeah, with my 150, I'm gonna raid a 3D thing.

4244
05:52:42,000 --> 05:52:43,400
I don't even think I could.

4245
05:52:45,280 --> 05:52:46,320
Is it Cocone?

4246
05:52:51,680 --> 05:52:52,520
Why am I not?

4247
05:52:52,560 --> 05:52:54,320
There's so many B and U girls.

4248
05:53:01,960 --> 05:53:03,360
Just like so many, I can't keep track

4249
05:53:03,360 --> 05:53:05,400
of who I'm following and not following.

4250
05:53:08,480 --> 05:53:10,480
Like there's some people that I'm missing.

4251
05:53:18,560 --> 05:53:19,640
You all.

4252
05:53:20,480 --> 05:53:25,480
It says I'm subscribed, but I feel like I'm not.

4253
05:53:27,800 --> 05:53:28,880
What?

4254
05:53:28,880 --> 05:53:30,640
Thank you for the gifted.

4255
05:53:31,720 --> 05:53:33,440
I have an amphibian, what the heck?

4256
05:53:34,520 --> 05:53:36,360
All right, we'll raid Cocone.

4257
05:53:37,240 --> 05:53:39,920
It was really fun hanging out with her with the...

4258
05:53:39,920 --> 05:53:42,280
I wanted to raid somebody new.

4259
05:53:42,280 --> 05:53:47,360
It was fun hanging out with her with the Goose Goose Duck.

4260
05:53:47,360 --> 05:53:48,720
I can't get out of here.

4261
05:53:49,640 --> 05:53:52,640
All right, it's not letting me raid her.

4262
05:53:53,640 --> 05:53:55,640
What the heck, man?

4263
05:54:00,640 --> 05:54:02,640
Is it because I just subbed?

4264
05:54:05,640 --> 05:54:08,640
Bro, youth who makes everything so freaking difficult.

4265
05:54:10,640 --> 05:54:12,640
I'm gonna lose my marbles.

4266
05:54:13,640 --> 05:54:15,640
I'm gonna lose my marbles.

4267
05:54:16,640 --> 05:54:18,640
I'm gonna lose my marbles.

4268
05:54:19,640 --> 05:54:22,640
I'm gonna make freaking lose it.

4269
05:54:23,640 --> 05:54:25,640
Come on, bro.

4270
05:54:26,640 --> 05:54:28,640
Why aren't you working?

4271
05:54:29,640 --> 05:54:30,640
There it is.

4272
05:54:30,640 --> 05:54:31,640
Perfect.

4273
05:54:31,640 --> 05:54:32,640
There we go.

4274
05:54:32,640 --> 05:54:33,640
Okay, cool, cool, cool, cool.

4275
05:54:34,640 --> 05:54:37,640
She is building Gundam.

4276
05:54:39,640 --> 05:54:42,640
Which is very nifty.

4277
05:54:42,640 --> 05:54:43,640
Okay.

4278
05:54:48,640 --> 05:54:50,640
Yes, everybody say thank you for all the gifted.

4279
05:54:51,640 --> 05:54:52,640
I'm gonna go to bed.

4280
05:54:52,640 --> 05:54:53,640
It's about midnight.

4281
05:54:54,640 --> 05:54:56,640
Have a good time, y'all.

4282
05:54:56,640 --> 05:54:59,640
Tell Cocone to say hello and just be like...

4283
05:55:00,640 --> 05:55:01,640
I don't know.

4284
05:55:04,640 --> 05:55:06,640
I don't know what to say for a raid message.

4285
05:55:13,640 --> 05:55:16,640
No, don't say bunny bazongas.

4286
05:55:17,640 --> 05:55:19,640
No, don't do that.

4287
05:55:20,640 --> 05:55:22,640
Just say Madam is sleepy.

4288
05:55:22,640 --> 05:55:23,640
Just sleepy raid.

4289
05:55:23,640 --> 05:55:24,640
Because I'm going to bed.

4290
05:55:24,640 --> 05:55:26,640
I don't think I'll be able to stop and say hi.

4291
05:55:26,640 --> 05:55:27,640
Be like, Madam says hi.

4292
05:55:27,640 --> 05:55:28,640
She's sleepy.

4293
05:55:29,640 --> 05:55:32,640
But she wants to tell us to say hi.

4294
05:55:33,640 --> 05:55:34,640
Sleepy Madam raid.

4295
05:55:35,640 --> 05:55:36,640
Sleepy Madam raid.

4296
05:55:37,640 --> 05:55:38,640
All right.

4297
05:55:39,640 --> 05:55:40,640
Later, you guys.

4298
05:55:40,640 --> 05:55:41,640
I'll see you tomorrow.

4299
05:55:42,640 --> 05:55:43,640
For the hand cam stream.

4300
05:55:43,640 --> 05:55:45,640
I think I'm gonna get my nails done

4301
05:55:45,640 --> 05:55:47,640
because my nails are a little bit grown out.

4302
05:55:50,640 --> 05:55:52,640
What time is my stream at?

4303
05:55:54,640 --> 05:55:55,640
Quick, to Twitter.

4304
05:55:55,640 --> 05:55:56,640
Away.

4305
05:55:57,640 --> 05:55:59,640
I've been like totally...

4306
05:56:01,640 --> 05:56:03,640
Oh, did I get suspended?

4307
05:56:04,640 --> 05:56:05,640
Okay, stuff wasn't loading.

4308
05:56:05,640 --> 05:56:08,640
When that happens, I just assume I got to suspended.

4309
05:56:09,640 --> 05:56:12,640
Okay, it's at 4 p.m.

4310
05:56:12,640 --> 05:56:14,640
I like have been all over the place with my schedule

4311
05:56:14,640 --> 05:56:16,640
because I've been having to get stuff done

4312
05:56:16,640 --> 05:56:17,640
and then take care of the cats

4313
05:56:17,640 --> 05:56:21,640
and then like have tours and then errands and then blah blah blah.

4314
05:56:21,640 --> 05:56:25,640
And then I keep forgetting what time I put my streams at

4315
05:56:25,640 --> 05:56:27,640
and then I'll miss the time.

4316
05:56:29,640 --> 05:56:31,640
All right, later guys.

4317
05:56:32,640 --> 05:56:33,640
Yes, cat and bum.

4318
05:56:34,640 --> 05:56:35,640
Night night.

4319
05:56:36,640 --> 05:56:37,640
Sleepy Madam raid.

4320
05:56:38,640 --> 05:56:39,640
Bye.

4321
05:56:41,640 --> 05:56:43,640
Kisses for the stinkies.

4322
05:56:43,640 --> 05:56:44,640
Stinky indeed.
