I'm locked out of stream elements.

395
01:35:33,940 --> 01:35:35,940
I'm locked out of stream elements.

396
01:35:35,940 --> 01:35:37,940
I'm locked out of stream elements.

397
01:35:37,940 --> 01:35:39,940
I'm locked out of stream elements.

398
01:35:39,940 --> 01:35:41,940
I'm locked out of stream.

399
01:35:53,940 --> 01:35:55,940
Okay. I need, where are my airpods.

400
01:35:55,940 --> 01:35:57,940
I need music. I need music so bad.

401
01:36:03,940 --> 01:36:05,940
I need music so bad.

402
01:36:09,940 --> 01:36:20,940
I'm just going to throw on some fucking Rob Zombie.

403
01:36:20,940 --> 01:36:47,940
I remember, I almost dropped something, I was playing as Rinna as a patient right there.

404
01:36:47,940 --> 01:36:57,940
I was playing as Rinna being called the lamb, and I was getting my ass handed to me with one of the bosses.

405
01:36:57,940 --> 01:37:02,940
And so I literally just put on Rob Zombie and I fucking rocked him.

406
01:37:02,940 --> 01:37:15,940
So that's my go to, is I just play some Rob Zombie, or just some dubstep or something.

407
01:37:15,940 --> 01:37:19,940
I don't know, I just have an easier time if I listen to music and I don't listen to the game.

408
01:37:19,940 --> 01:37:24,940
And I can just focus on movement, and so I think the sound distracts me.

409
01:37:24,940 --> 01:37:27,940
Alright, let me just...

410
01:37:28,940 --> 01:37:30,940
I'm thinking about playing sick bubblegum.

411
01:37:30,940 --> 01:37:32,940
The Skrillex remix.

412
01:37:57,940 --> 01:38:07,940
Shibi is the muppet that's operating the model.

413
01:38:07,940 --> 01:38:21,940
The muppet's operating the model.

414
01:38:21,940 --> 01:38:27,940
Dragula, Dragula is also good.

415
01:38:27,940 --> 01:38:29,940
We all know how we're going to die, baby.

416
01:38:29,940 --> 01:38:34,940
Wait, I can't have my model open while I have YouTube open, that's stupid.

417
01:38:34,940 --> 01:38:45,940
Alright, well, ventriloquism.

418
01:38:45,940 --> 01:38:50,940
Alright, I'm in the zone, I feel good.

419
01:38:50,940 --> 01:38:54,940
Please, let me the fucking...

420
01:39:20,940 --> 01:39:26,940
Alright, I'm in the zone, I feel good.

421
01:39:51,940 --> 01:39:56,940
Now I'm getting too into music.

422
01:39:56,940 --> 01:40:01,940
Oh fuck.

423
01:40:01,940 --> 01:40:12,940
Sick bubblegum.

424
01:40:21,940 --> 01:40:26,940
I can't believe I breathed almost on my first try, and then I fucked it up.

425
01:40:26,940 --> 01:40:36,940
And I fell off the map the second time.

426
01:40:50,940 --> 01:41:00,940
Alright, I'm in the zone, I feel good.

427
01:41:00,940 --> 01:41:10,940
I'm in the zone, I feel good.

428
01:41:10,940 --> 01:41:38,940
I'm stuck.

429
01:41:38,940 --> 01:42:06,940
Oh, I just noticed my health.

430
01:42:06,940 --> 01:42:16,940
I'm in the zone, I feel good.

431
01:42:16,940 --> 01:42:26,940
Alright, let's do Dragula.

432
01:42:46,940 --> 01:43:11,940
I'm stuck.

433
01:43:12,940 --> 01:43:22,940
I'm stuck.

434
01:43:22,940 --> 01:43:25,940
Now I threw it, I didn't know you could do that.

435
01:43:25,940 --> 01:43:31,940
Dig through the ditches and I'm not paying attention to my health because this music is good.

436
01:43:31,940 --> 01:43:35,940
Dragula.

437
01:43:35,940 --> 01:43:36,940
Hi, Boomi.

438
01:43:36,940 --> 01:43:41,940
Boomi, I need your little titties as a little stress ball.

439
01:43:41,940 --> 01:43:44,940
Thank you.

440
01:43:44,940 --> 01:43:46,940
So many apps.

441
01:43:46,940 --> 01:43:56,940
Stream's going good.

442
01:44:16,940 --> 01:44:36,940
I'm in the zone, I feel good.

443
01:44:36,940 --> 01:44:52,940
Fuck.

444
01:44:52,940 --> 01:45:04,940
I got cornered, I knew I was going to get stuck back here.

445
01:45:04,940 --> 01:45:10,940
I'm going to be quiet until I beat him, I apologize.

446
01:45:10,940 --> 01:45:20,940
I can never die, dig through the ditches and burn through the witches of Sam in the back of my Dragula.

447
01:45:41,940 --> 01:45:47,940
No, fuck, I didn't get the stagger.

448
01:45:47,940 --> 01:45:58,940
I got locked into another animation.

449
01:45:58,940 --> 01:46:27,940
I need heal.

450
01:46:27,940 --> 01:46:30,940
And no!

451
01:46:30,940 --> 01:46:42,940
Alright, next song.

452
01:46:42,940 --> 01:46:52,940
Shut me up, my little self-indulgence, let's go.

453
01:46:52,940 --> 01:46:55,940
The bass, the rock, the mic, the treble.

454
01:46:55,940 --> 01:47:01,940
I like my coffee black just like my middle with the bass, the rock, the mic, the treble.

455
01:47:01,940 --> 01:47:05,940
I like my coffee black just like my middle cuz.

456
01:47:05,940 --> 01:47:09,940
Oh, knock me up in a minute, minute, minute, and a fucking minute.

457
01:47:09,940 --> 01:47:14,940
I can't wait for you to knock me up in a minute, minute, and a second.

458
01:47:14,940 --> 01:47:20,940
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit like fuck.

459
01:47:20,940 --> 01:47:26,940
It's fine, it's too far away.

460
01:47:26,940 --> 01:47:35,940
Oh, it was stuck in the animation cuz I accidentally pressed the button.

461
01:47:35,940 --> 01:47:38,940
Shut.

462
01:47:38,940 --> 01:47:49,940
La la la, ooh la la la, ooh la la la.

463
01:47:49,940 --> 01:47:55,940
The whip timed perfectly when you threw it.

464
01:47:55,940 --> 01:47:59,940
Oh, it's funny.

465
01:47:59,940 --> 01:48:03,940
I can't wait for you to knock me up in a minute, minute.

466
01:48:03,940 --> 01:48:10,940
I'm so fucking stupid, I can't wait for you to knock me up in a minute, minute, and a second.

467
01:48:10,940 --> 01:48:17,940
I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit like badass.

468
01:48:17,940 --> 01:48:23,940
All right.

469
01:48:23,940 --> 01:48:33,940
I'm getting worse.

470
01:48:33,940 --> 01:48:55,940
It's a great music video.

471
01:48:55,940 --> 01:49:14,940
All right, timed that horribly.

472
01:49:14,940 --> 01:49:30,940
I thought I was gonna stagger him.

473
01:49:30,940 --> 01:49:32,940
I, I...

474
01:49:32,940 --> 01:49:36,940
Whoa, ah!

475
01:49:36,940 --> 01:49:38,940
I'm almost dead.

476
01:49:38,940 --> 01:49:41,940
That's not the one.

477
01:49:41,940 --> 01:49:48,940
Thank you for letting me heal.

478
01:50:12,940 --> 01:50:14,940
Oh.

479
01:50:14,940 --> 01:50:17,940
I'm getting animation locked.

480
01:50:17,940 --> 01:50:19,940
Yeah, I'm dead.

481
01:50:19,940 --> 01:50:33,940
I'm dead.

482
01:50:33,940 --> 01:50:37,940
Declan hide, five finger death punch.

483
01:50:37,940 --> 01:50:41,940
Which is gonna be the magical song, like that's it.

484
01:50:41,940 --> 01:50:43,940
Yes, I'm still in the market!

485
01:50:43,940 --> 01:50:56,940
Fuck off!

486
01:50:56,940 --> 01:50:59,940
I didn't even do a lot of damage.

487
01:50:59,940 --> 01:51:02,940
Ow.

488
01:51:02,940 --> 01:51:12,940
There's a demon.

489
01:51:12,940 --> 01:51:13,940
This is a good run.

490
01:51:13,940 --> 01:51:22,940
I'm just gonna let him kill me.

491
01:51:22,940 --> 01:51:24,940
Are my cats making noise?

492
01:51:24,940 --> 01:51:30,940
What are you guys doing?

493
01:51:30,940 --> 01:51:32,940
I think I'm just drinking water.

494
01:51:32,940 --> 01:51:34,940
What are the other cats doing?

495
01:51:34,940 --> 01:51:35,940
Like nirvana?

496
01:51:35,940 --> 01:51:36,940
Yeah.

497
01:51:36,940 --> 01:51:42,940
Something's in my ass.

498
01:51:42,940 --> 01:51:44,940
Damn, wait on your shoulder.

499
01:51:44,940 --> 01:51:51,940
I just saved your motherfucking life.

500
01:52:14,940 --> 01:52:39,940
Why did I ever feel this pain?

501
01:52:39,940 --> 01:52:49,940
Hey, hey, hey!

502
01:53:09,940 --> 01:53:38,940
No, I missed it!

503
01:53:38,940 --> 01:54:07,940
I'm trying to heal.

504
01:54:07,940 --> 01:54:22,940
Okay, another song.

505
01:54:22,940 --> 01:54:39,940
Maybe I need something at the right BPM.

506
01:54:39,940 --> 01:55:05,940
Okay, locked to DNMO mix.

507
01:55:05,940 --> 01:55:34,940
Are you gonna do anything, bro?

508
01:55:34,940 --> 01:56:01,940
I'm locking in, closing all my tabs, besides the game.

509
01:56:01,940 --> 01:56:21,940
I'm getting sloppy, bro!

510
01:56:21,940 --> 01:56:50,940
Fuck, bro!

511
01:56:51,940 --> 01:57:19,940
I'm getting sloppy, bro!

512
01:57:19,940 --> 01:57:48,940
I'm getting sloppy, bro!

513
01:57:49,940 --> 01:58:16,940
I didn't think he was gonna hit me with that.

514
01:58:16,940 --> 01:58:21,940
All right.

515
01:58:21,940 --> 01:58:22,940
Spit.

516
01:58:22,940 --> 01:58:48,940
My slush puppy.

517
01:58:48,940 --> 01:59:01,940
Misfit, misfit, and trouble.

518
01:59:01,940 --> 01:59:30,940
Shit icon, each spit get dicked with the lights on.

519
01:59:31,940 --> 01:59:57,940
Misfit, misfit, and trouble.

520
01:59:57,940 --> 02:00:07,940
That bitch, clean shit icon, each spit get dicked with the lights on.

521
02:00:07,940 --> 02:00:10,940
You guys can't tell how much I'm stimming right now.

522
02:00:10,940 --> 02:00:26,940
My legs are going crazy.

523
02:00:26,940 --> 02:00:43,940
I didn't have to heal.

524
02:00:43,940 --> 02:00:44,940
I'm getting too eager.

525
02:00:44,940 --> 02:00:50,940
I'm getting too eager!

526
02:00:50,940 --> 02:00:51,940
He's like, wow, you're awesome.

527
02:00:51,940 --> 02:00:52,940
Wait, you're dead.

528
02:00:56,940 --> 02:01:23,940
Fuck, I love this song.

529
02:01:23,940 --> 02:01:33,940
I'm getting too angry.

530
02:01:33,940 --> 02:01:58,940
What is up with my timing?

531
02:01:58,940 --> 02:02:18,940
I don't know why I pressed that twice.

532
02:02:18,940 --> 02:02:27,940
I shouldn't have healed until I jumped.

533
02:02:27,940 --> 02:02:47,940
I shouldn't have healed until I jumped.

534
02:02:47,940 --> 02:03:00,940
I need to heal.

535
02:03:00,940 --> 02:03:01,940
I need to heal.

536
02:03:01,940 --> 02:03:02,940
I need to heal.

537
02:03:02,940 --> 02:03:07,940
Don't worry, but I'm not.

538
02:03:07,940 --> 02:03:14,940
I'm just dancing.

539
02:03:14,940 --> 02:03:21,940
I need to do a lap.

540
02:03:44,940 --> 02:03:52,940
I'm dancing to the hum of your fridge.

541
02:03:52,940 --> 02:03:53,940
Fuck out.

542
02:03:53,940 --> 02:03:54,940
I like the lighting.

543
02:03:54,940 --> 02:03:55,940
I like your waitress.

544
02:03:55,940 --> 02:03:56,940
She's pretty hot.

545
02:03:56,940 --> 02:04:16,940
I'm going to do this homeless guy.

546
02:04:16,940 --> 02:04:25,940
I'm putting my clothes back on.

547
02:04:25,940 --> 02:04:51,940
Everybody get up and twerk.

548
02:04:51,940 --> 02:05:11,940
Alright, how have I been looking at chat?

549
02:05:11,940 --> 02:05:17,940
Let me see what you say.

550
02:05:17,940 --> 02:05:20,940
I have a camera mode too.

551
02:05:20,940 --> 02:05:22,940
I'm throwing it back as hard as possible.

552
02:05:22,940 --> 02:05:23,940
My back hurts.

553
02:05:23,940 --> 02:05:30,940
I need a good twerk song.

554
02:05:30,940 --> 02:05:59,940
I need a good twerk song.

555
02:05:59,940 --> 02:06:19,940

02:06:19,940 --> 02:06:48,940
I need a good twerk song.

557
02:06:48,940 --> 02:07:08,940

02:07:08,940 --> 02:07:37,940
I need a good twerk song.

02:07:37,940 --> 02:08:06,940
I need a good twerk song.

02:08:06,940 --> 02:08:35,940
I need a good twerk song.

02:08:35,940 --> 02:08:55,940
I need a good twerk song.

562
02:08:55,940 --> 02:09:22,940
I need a good twerk song.

563
02:09:22,940 --> 02:09:49,940
I need a good twerk song.

564
02:09:49,940 --> 02:10:17,940
I need a good twerk song.

565
02:10:17,940 --> 02:10:46,940
I need a good twerk song.

I need a good twerk song.

570

Come on down here, lady.

1051
05:47:23,940 --> 05:47:29,940
Wow.

1052
05:47:29,940 --> 05:47:42,940
Hey, how the awe feels so accurate here about this expression.

1053
05:47:42,940 --> 05:47:48,940
It's so weird how weirdly proportioned her body is.

1054
05:47:48,940 --> 05:48:04,940
She has such a small head and a huge body.

1055
05:48:04,940 --> 05:48:17,940
I call the kids just disappear.

1056
05:48:17,940 --> 05:48:35,940
Sorry, I'm trying to kill your mom.

1057
05:48:35,940 --> 05:48:47,940
Now she just buffs her mom.

1058
05:48:47,940 --> 05:48:56,940
Such a badass shot, though.

1059
05:48:56,940 --> 05:49:09,940
Ooh, she's locked in.

1060
05:49:09,940 --> 05:49:24,940
Not many men there.

1061
05:49:24,940 --> 05:49:44,940
I hate that she just jumps out of the way.

1062
05:49:44,940 --> 05:49:49,940
I might just go at her with my sword.

1063
05:49:49,940 --> 05:49:53,940
Fuck, I fucked that up so hard.

1064
05:49:53,940 --> 05:50:00,940
I can't even direct myself.

1065
05:50:00,940 --> 05:50:09,940
I gotta do this shit again.

1066
05:50:09,940 --> 05:50:10,940
Indeed.

1067
05:50:10,940 --> 05:50:29,940
Racing Moonvale.

1068
05:50:29,940 --> 05:50:36,940
Yup, I missed.

1069
05:50:36,940 --> 05:50:48,940
It's really just like, oh, because then you have to deal with her second phase.

1070
05:50:48,940 --> 05:50:59,940
It's also mostly just like, why isn't there a fucking grace next to the thing that pisses me off to no end?

1071
05:50:59,940 --> 05:51:02,940
Because then I gotta deal with these motherfuckers.

1072
05:51:02,940 --> 05:51:15,940
I'm gonna kill them so they don't fucking...

1073
05:51:15,940 --> 05:51:17,940
I don't like them.

1074
05:51:17,940 --> 05:51:19,940
Go away.

1075
05:51:19,940 --> 05:51:24,940
I just spam shit and then I gotta like...

1076
05:51:24,940 --> 05:51:26,940
Oh my god.

1077
05:51:26,940 --> 05:51:34,940
This health I don't need to be wasting.

1078
05:51:34,940 --> 05:51:38,940
Yeah, I think the ball route is better.

1079
05:51:38,940 --> 05:51:39,940
Fuck off.

1080
05:51:39,940 --> 05:51:53,940
I don't even bother.

1081
05:51:53,940 --> 05:52:08,940
Sometimes I just want to jump in there and get all crushed.

1082
05:52:08,940 --> 05:52:20,940
Alright.

1083
05:52:20,940 --> 05:52:23,940
Fuck off.

1084
05:52:23,940 --> 05:52:26,940
I can't kill you fast enough.

1085
05:52:26,940 --> 05:52:28,940
Actually, I realize I don't have to kill them.

1086
05:52:28,940 --> 05:52:44,940
I just have to bop them.

1087
05:52:44,940 --> 05:52:59,940
For free?

1088
05:52:59,940 --> 05:53:07,940
Can I please drink a glass?

1089
05:53:07,940 --> 05:53:27,940
Ha!

1090
05:53:27,940 --> 05:53:31,940
Can you chill?

1091
05:53:31,940 --> 05:53:38,940
Am I about to get killed?

1092
05:53:38,940 --> 05:53:42,940
I love the music in this.

1093
05:53:42,940 --> 05:53:43,940
Oh my god.

1094
05:53:43,940 --> 05:53:48,940
I fucking need to lock down bitches.

1095
05:53:48,940 --> 05:53:51,940
Get out of the way!

1096
05:53:51,940 --> 05:54:00,940
Shut up!

1097
05:54:00,940 --> 05:54:05,940
No.

1098
05:54:05,940 --> 05:54:12,940
Oh my god.

1099
05:54:12,940 --> 05:54:41,940
This is annoying.

1100
05:54:42,940 --> 05:54:44,940
Oh my god.

1101
05:54:44,940 --> 05:54:46,940
I was hoping I wouldn't get hit by that.

1102
05:54:46,940 --> 05:55:13,940
That's whatever.

1103
05:55:13,940 --> 05:55:28,940
Get out of the way, you little bitch.

1104
05:55:28,940 --> 05:55:54,940
Thank god.

1105
05:55:54,940 --> 05:55:56,940
Her grippers are huge.

1106
05:55:56,940 --> 05:56:21,940
I like Lady Dimitrescu's feet because Lady Dimitrescu is hotter.

1107
05:56:21,940 --> 05:56:24,940
I'm going to turn into a moon, really?

1108
05:56:24,940 --> 05:56:30,940
It's not really cash money of you.

1109
05:56:30,940 --> 05:56:40,940
Ow, that actually hurt a lot.

1110
05:56:40,940 --> 05:56:49,940
Get over here.

1111
05:56:49,940 --> 05:56:51,940
What the fuck was that?

1112
05:56:51,940 --> 05:57:01,940
Are you a little staff at me?

1113
05:57:01,940 --> 05:57:04,940
Well, this is going to be a long one.

1114
05:57:04,940 --> 05:57:05,940
I can already fucking tell.

1115
05:57:05,940 --> 05:57:12,940
It's going to take a while to kill her, Nala.

1116
05:57:12,940 --> 05:57:13,940
Smash?

1117
05:57:13,940 --> 05:57:14,940
Smash or password for Nala?

1118
05:57:14,940 --> 05:57:15,940
No, she has too many issues.

1119
05:57:15,940 --> 05:57:16,940
I don't feel like dealing with all that.

1120
05:57:16,940 --> 05:57:18,940
She's a weird thing with kids.

1121
05:57:18,940 --> 05:57:20,940
I'm not about it.

1122
05:57:20,940 --> 05:57:23,940
She has 80% magic resistance.

1123
05:57:23,940 --> 05:57:29,940
Wow.

1124
05:57:29,940 --> 05:57:38,940
Should I be using a different weapon then?

1125
05:57:38,940 --> 05:57:40,940
Although she was weak against the gravity.

1126
05:57:40,940 --> 05:57:41,940
I'm not.

1127
05:57:41,940 --> 05:57:55,940
The gravity did do some damage on her.

1128
05:57:55,940 --> 05:57:56,940
Yeah, okay.

1129
05:57:56,940 --> 05:58:02,940
Well, I guess we'll...

1130
05:58:02,940 --> 05:58:06,940
Yeah.

1131
05:58:07,940 --> 05:58:15,940
We'll figure it out.

1132
05:58:15,940 --> 05:58:17,940
Oh, it's just a portal that they come from.

1133
05:58:17,940 --> 05:58:28,940
That's nifty.

1134
05:58:28,940 --> 05:58:29,940
That's true.

1135
05:58:29,940 --> 05:58:30,940
I'm just throwing rocks at her.

1136
05:58:30,940 --> 05:58:31,940
All right.

1137
05:58:31,940 --> 05:58:35,940
Then I'll kill her with the sword and I'll switch to magic.

1138
05:58:35,940 --> 05:58:40,940
I'll switch to the gravity.

1139
05:58:40,940 --> 05:58:52,940
I'm not going to use any of my ashes at all so I can conserve using them.

1140
05:58:52,940 --> 05:59:01,940
I might do a jellyfish to poison her, perhaps.

1141
05:59:01,940 --> 05:59:26,940
Hold on a moment.

1142
05:59:26,940 --> 05:59:42,940
Hi, Fia.

1143
05:59:42,940 --> 05:59:45,940
What are you doing, little girl?

1144
05:59:45,940 --> 05:59:54,940
Just trying to help my lamp.

1145
05:59:54,940 --> 05:59:56,940
You're just getting it stuck to my chair.

1146
05:59:56,940 --> 06:00:11,940
Can you hear her little claws just going...

1147
06:00:11,940 --> 06:00:23,940
Sorry, I need to calm down and pet my cat.

1148
06:00:23,940 --> 06:00:30,940
What are you guys sticking your head in the trash for?

1149
06:00:30,940 --> 06:00:34,940
I just remember to pay them after you beat the boss.

1150
06:00:34,940 --> 06:00:35,940
Fia.

1151
06:00:35,940 --> 06:00:36,940
The deathbed companion.

1152
06:00:36,940 --> 06:00:37,940
Come here, Fia.

1153
06:00:37,940 --> 06:00:38,940
I want to pick you up.

1154
06:00:38,940 --> 06:00:39,940
Fia.

1155
06:00:39,940 --> 06:00:40,940
How well?

1156
06:00:40,940 --> 06:00:41,940
How's it going?

1157
06:00:41,940 --> 06:00:42,940
Oh, look at your little face.

1158
06:00:42,940 --> 06:00:43,940
With your little pink nose.

1159
06:00:43,940 --> 06:00:44,940
With your little eyes.

1160
06:00:44,940 --> 06:00:55,940
You're getting a little round, lady.

1161
06:00:55,940 --> 06:00:58,940
Are you coming a little chunker?

1162
06:00:58,940 --> 06:00:59,940
I don't know.

1163
06:00:59,940 --> 06:01:03,940
Fia kind of looks like a ferret for a meerkat.

1164
06:01:03,940 --> 06:01:10,940
I had to post that picture of her sitting up on her hind legies and she looked so goofy.

1165
06:01:10,940 --> 06:01:17,940
She looked like a little meerkat.

1166
06:01:17,940 --> 06:01:28,940
Oh, shoulder.

1167
06:01:28,940 --> 06:01:30,940
I love a round kitty.

1168
06:01:30,940 --> 06:01:31,940
What do you mean?

1169
06:01:31,940 --> 06:01:35,940
I don't want her to be chunky.

1170
06:01:35,940 --> 06:01:39,940
She needs to be my little small gal.

1171
06:01:39,940 --> 06:01:46,940
I don't want her to get in, like, having health issues or something.

1172
06:01:46,940 --> 06:01:53,940
I remember my friend's cat had this thing about shoving its face in a girl's shoes and just walking around like that.

1173
06:01:53,940 --> 06:01:55,940
That's so funny.

1174
06:01:55,940 --> 06:02:02,940
Fia likes to stick her toys in my shoes and hang out.

1175
06:02:02,940 --> 06:02:04,940
I don't know why.

1176
06:02:04,940 --> 06:02:06,940
She also just likes to lick my feet.

1177
06:02:06,940 --> 06:02:13,940
She woke me up and scared me because she was licking my feet while I was sleeping.

1178
06:02:13,940 --> 06:02:23,940
The other day, I was scared the crap out of me because it was early morning.

1179
06:02:23,940 --> 06:02:29,940
I think I had fallen asleep on the couch or something from watching TV.

1180
06:02:29,940 --> 06:02:33,940
Sometimes if I can't sleep, I'll move to different places to sleep.

1181
06:02:34,940 --> 06:02:41,940
I woke up and she was licking a nibble in my feet and I was like, ah!

1182
06:02:41,940 --> 06:02:44,940
She's something.

1183
06:02:44,940 --> 06:02:47,940
She also really liked when I got my toes done.

1184
06:02:47,940 --> 06:02:55,940
Her and Boomi were sniffing my feet.

1185
06:02:55,940 --> 06:03:00,940
I'm gonna fuck where it'll be us go.

1186
06:03:00,940 --> 06:03:02,940
All right.

1187
06:03:02,940 --> 06:03:05,940
I'm so tired of this lady.

1188
06:03:05,940 --> 06:03:07,940
It's the steps.

1189
06:03:07,940 --> 06:03:08,940
It's the steps that's annoying.

1190
06:03:08,940 --> 06:03:13,940
I wish she was more straightforward.

1191
06:03:13,940 --> 06:03:15,940
All right, we're two-handed in it.

1192
06:03:15,940 --> 06:03:25,940
We're looking for one of the first bitches.

1193
06:03:25,940 --> 06:03:27,940
Ow.

1194
06:03:27,940 --> 06:03:29,940
Unlock.

1195
06:03:29,940 --> 06:03:35,940
There's the next one.

1196
06:03:35,940 --> 06:03:37,940
I hear you.

1197
06:03:37,940 --> 06:03:51,940
Where are you, child?

1198
06:03:51,940 --> 06:03:53,940
Here.

1199
06:04:09,940 --> 06:04:12,940
There's a lot of people singing right now.

1200
06:04:12,940 --> 06:04:17,940
I need to unlock.

1201
06:04:17,940 --> 06:04:23,940
I kind of want to hide over here until she shoots her little fucking thing.

1202
06:04:23,940 --> 06:04:27,940
I've actually never seen her do it.

1203
06:04:27,940 --> 06:04:35,940
Oh, they just get turned into gravestones?

1204
06:04:35,940 --> 06:04:36,940
Oh, my God.

1205
06:04:36,940 --> 06:04:38,940
Fia is actually sniffing and licking my feet right now.

1206
06:04:38,940 --> 06:04:40,940
Stop.

1207
06:04:40,940 --> 06:04:51,940
She heard me talking shit.

1208
06:04:51,940 --> 06:04:55,940
Are they all golf chicks?

1209
06:04:55,940 --> 06:04:58,940
Oh, God, my nose is itchy.

1210
06:04:58,940 --> 06:05:03,940
Ow.

1211
06:05:03,940 --> 06:05:06,940
Get back down here, lady.

1212
06:05:06,940 --> 06:05:19,940
Look at my heel.

1213
06:05:19,940 --> 06:05:35,940
I need one more.

1214
06:05:35,940 --> 06:05:40,940
I love my fucking knocking kids out.

1215
06:05:40,940 --> 06:05:52,940
I'm going to turn into fucking gravestones.

1216
06:05:52,940 --> 06:05:56,940
Oh, that did not save me.

1217
06:05:56,940 --> 06:05:59,940
I'll tell you that much.

1218
06:05:59,940 --> 06:06:08,940
Should have used the Wonders Psychic for that.

1219
06:06:08,940 --> 06:06:10,940
Ow.

1220
06:06:10,940 --> 06:06:28,940
Ow, I walked into that one.

1221
06:06:28,940 --> 06:06:32,940
Ow.

1222
06:06:32,940 --> 06:06:36,940
I didn't know she was an Abbey Shepherd sheep, you viewer.

1223
06:06:36,940 --> 06:06:40,940
Do you have a cat that likes to get high after mineral ice smell?

1224
06:06:40,940 --> 06:06:42,940
What?

1225
06:06:42,940 --> 06:06:50,940
Like the water?

1226
06:06:50,940 --> 06:06:55,940
Oh, I need to get out of the way first.

1227
06:06:55,940 --> 06:06:57,940
Oh, no, that's a shield.

1228
06:06:57,940 --> 06:07:00,940
Oh, no, I'm stuck.

1229
06:07:00,940 --> 06:07:03,940
It's fine.

1230
06:07:03,940 --> 06:07:31,940
Okay, it's not fine.

1231
06:07:31,940 --> 06:07:36,940
No, I was trying to heal.

1232
06:07:36,940 --> 06:07:42,940
Oh, I hate Rinala so much.

1233
06:07:42,940 --> 06:07:50,940
What's another spell like the gravity one that I can use on her?

1234
06:07:50,940 --> 06:07:57,940
What's another spell like that?

1235
06:07:57,940 --> 06:08:07,940
I need something long range, but the thing with the gravity spell is that nothing you have,

1236
06:08:07,940 --> 06:08:14,940
but I can go get it.

1237
06:08:14,940 --> 06:08:19,940
The thing is that, I regret what I was going to say.

1238
06:08:19,940 --> 06:08:28,940
Oh, my, I almost missed again.

1239
06:08:28,940 --> 06:08:43,940
Making my way downtown, walking fast, faces past, and I'm homebound.

1240
06:08:43,940 --> 06:08:54,940
I've been nothing with a strength deck, so that's fine.

1241
06:08:54,940 --> 06:08:59,940
I did, I used, I can't even remember what I beat her with.

1242
06:08:59,940 --> 06:09:06,940
I think I beat her with the Halo Scythe, or did I beat her?

1243
06:09:06,940 --> 06:09:08,940
Wait a second.

1244
06:09:08,940 --> 06:09:14,940
I'm going to do it one more time, and then I realize I should probably upgrade my Glenstone staff.

1245
06:09:14,940 --> 06:09:17,940
I mean, my Muterite staff.

1246
06:09:17,940 --> 06:09:21,940
I didn't do that, I only upgraded my, can I upgrade my staff?

1247
06:09:21,940 --> 06:09:23,940
I can upgrade my staff, right?

1248
06:09:23,940 --> 06:09:28,940
Again, I've never been a sorcerer, so I don't fucking know anything.

1249
06:09:28,940 --> 06:09:33,940
Fia, I can feel you grabbing my chair.

1250
06:09:33,940 --> 06:09:37,940
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

1251
06:09:37,940 --> 06:09:41,940
Fuck, fuck, fuck off.

1252
06:09:51,940 --> 06:09:54,940
Yeah.

1253
06:10:03,940 --> 06:10:30,940
I feel like I'm in prison.

1254
06:10:30,940 --> 06:10:55,460
Oh, I was hoping it wouldn't hit me.

1255
06:10:56,460 --> 06:10:59,460
What am I doing?

1256
06:11:09,460 --> 06:11:11,460
Ow.

1257
06:11:13,460 --> 06:11:17,460
Stop hitting me, they're stupid fucking books. Oh god, everybody's spitting fire.

1258
06:11:25,460 --> 06:11:52,460
I can't tell where she is, is everybody singing the same fucking song? Ow. What? I swear, I already did. Wait, did I miss something?

1259
06:11:55,460 --> 06:12:11,460
Did I? Did I? Did I already kill enough and I didn't even fucking realize? I don't even... I don't... I don't fucking know, bro.

1260
06:12:11,460 --> 06:12:28,460
I feel like it glitched. I feel like it just glitched. Yeah, she fell for like a second and then she got right back up. That was weird. I thought that was me, but I don't think it is.

1261
06:12:33,460 --> 06:12:36,460
Oh, now you come down.

1262
06:12:41,460 --> 06:13:10,460
Okay. Stop, you fucking little bitches. Oh my fucking god, dude, I hate Renala. She's the most annoying... I beat her so easily the first time because I just... I think I know what I'm going to do.

1263
06:13:11,460 --> 06:13:13,460
I think I know what I'm going to get.

1264
06:13:13,460 --> 06:13:42,460
I don't know why her fight music sounds like a good idea.

1265
06:13:43,460 --> 06:13:50,460
Yeah, anime, OST. To me.

1266
06:14:14,460 --> 06:14:28,460
Talisman does make me do double damage. I just skimmed my ass.

1267
06:14:28,460 --> 06:14:41,460
Oh my god. Ah, I didn't mean to do that one.

1268
06:14:59,460 --> 06:15:04,460
Fabulous.

1269
06:15:11,460 --> 06:15:21,460
I am using the meteorite staff. What? Have I not been using it the entire time? I got it. Yeah, no, I'm using it.

1270
06:15:29,460 --> 06:15:34,460
I know what I'm going to go get.

1271
06:15:44,460 --> 06:15:47,460
One moment.

1272
06:15:58,460 --> 06:16:01,460
One moment.

1273
06:16:01,460 --> 06:16:04,460
One moment.

1274
06:16:04,460 --> 06:16:07,460
One moment.

1275
06:16:24,460 --> 06:16:28,460
Wait, I don't think I'm able to scale.

1276
06:16:35,460 --> 06:16:39,460
Fuck, yeah, I need to play it more.

1277
06:16:46,460 --> 06:16:52,460
I need something that builds.

1278
06:16:53,460 --> 06:17:04,460
Maybe if I... I need to poison her or I need to scarlet rot her ass.

1279
06:17:05,460 --> 06:17:11,460
Yeah, the Talisman moves. I don't.

1280
06:17:11,460 --> 06:17:17,460
Which one is that? I know it's the one with the heads on it, I believe.

1281
06:17:17,460 --> 06:17:22,460
There are some arrows. No, bro, what? No.

1282
06:17:22,460 --> 06:17:28,460
With what bow? I don't even have a fucking bow. Jollyfish can poison? Alright, true.

1283
06:17:29,460 --> 06:17:34,460
Serpent bow. That's true.

1284
06:17:40,460 --> 06:17:46,460
But I feel like the Jollyfish will just get fucking, yeah, dragon breath, but you need faith for that.

1285
06:17:46,460 --> 06:17:50,460
I think I have one, aren't I? Okay.

1286
06:17:51,460 --> 06:17:58,460
You can grab the poison mist ash, but I can't apply the ash to my sword.

1287
06:17:58,460 --> 06:18:03,460
Okay.

1288
06:18:16,460 --> 06:18:21,460
I can get the neck, yeah. But like, I don't want to...

1289
06:18:21,460 --> 06:18:27,460
I feel like it would be easier if I honestly just tried to brute force this.

1290
06:18:28,460 --> 06:18:33,460
Hmm.

1291
06:18:35,460 --> 06:18:39,460
Because I don't think it'll help too much.

1292
06:18:39,460 --> 06:18:44,460
If anything, I'll get the medallion, the boost sorcery.

1293
06:18:58,460 --> 06:19:03,460
Breathe in, blast, Talisman.

1294
06:19:15,460 --> 06:19:20,460
Oh, I forgot where he's like, in her Talisman.

1295
06:19:28,460 --> 06:19:33,460
Okay.

1296
06:19:43,460 --> 06:19:48,460
Because honestly, the sword seal is helpful, but it's also fucking me at the same time.

1297
06:19:59,460 --> 06:20:06,460
The dragon crest shield could offset the damage. No.

1298
06:20:17,460 --> 06:20:22,460
Is there a medallion that reduces damage taken?

1299
06:20:29,460 --> 06:20:33,460
Take your ash, Talisman.

1300
06:20:38,460 --> 06:20:42,460
That connection.

1301
06:20:50,460 --> 06:20:54,460
It's not a great job.

1302
06:20:59,460 --> 06:21:04,460
That's true, that would produce the magic taken.

1303
06:21:05,460 --> 06:21:10,460
Good morning.

1304
06:21:29,460 --> 06:21:34,460
That's one of the runes there.

1305
06:21:34,460 --> 06:21:39,460
Yeah, I was thinking about the graven school, Talisman.

1306
06:21:39,460 --> 06:21:44,460
I just have to remember where to get it.

1307
06:21:44,460 --> 06:21:49,460
Plus 1 million in the staff of Blossom, Night Comet, which is a lot of money.

1308
06:21:49,460 --> 06:21:54,460
Yeah.

1309
06:21:54,460 --> 06:21:59,460
Yeah, because I just have to kill the room bear.

1310
06:21:59,460 --> 06:22:04,460
So I'll go and get that.

1311
06:22:04,460 --> 06:22:09,460
And then...

1312
06:22:09,460 --> 06:22:14,460
I'll go and get that.

1313
06:22:14,460 --> 06:22:19,460
And then...

1314
06:22:19,460 --> 06:22:24,460
Well, it's either like, do I want to boost my own or do I want to?

1315
06:22:24,460 --> 06:22:29,460
It's probably better if I actually negate.

1316
06:22:29,460 --> 06:22:34,460
Uh...

1317
06:22:34,460 --> 06:22:39,460
Where is that?

1318
06:22:39,460 --> 06:22:44,460
Wait, no, what am I doing?

1319
06:22:44,460 --> 06:22:49,460
It's in the Weeping Peninsula.

1320
06:22:49,460 --> 06:22:54,460
Where in the Weeping Peninsula is it?

1321
06:23:04,460 --> 06:23:09,460
I need a map.

1322
06:23:14,460 --> 06:23:20,460
Uh...

1323
06:23:44,460 --> 06:23:49,460
Damn it, I fell asleep again.

1324
06:23:49,460 --> 06:23:54,460
It's fine, it's not like I haven't been streaming for like hours.

1325
06:24:04,460 --> 06:24:09,460
Fuck, what number did I say it is?

1326
06:24:09,460 --> 06:24:13,460
I don't know which way I'm fucking going.

1327
06:24:13,460 --> 06:24:18,460
I'm assuming it's 2.

1328
06:24:18,460 --> 06:24:23,460
Where did I put my 1?

1329
06:24:30,460 --> 06:24:35,460
Hey, I wish I would show you when you put your own fucking markers.

1330
06:24:43,460 --> 06:24:48,460
Okay, where's this fucking bear?

1331
06:25:02,460 --> 06:25:07,460
I don't care about no damn goblins, where's this fucking bear?

1332
06:25:07,460 --> 06:25:12,460
There it is.

1333
06:25:12,460 --> 06:25:17,460
What? No, that's not a bear.

1334
06:25:17,460 --> 06:25:22,460
That is the demigod thingy.

1335
06:25:22,460 --> 06:25:27,460
It's demihumanlady.

1336
06:25:27,460 --> 06:25:32,460
She drops like a staff if I recall.

1337
06:25:32,460 --> 06:25:37,460
Where am I?

1338
06:25:37,460 --> 06:25:42,460
It's over here.

1339
06:25:56,460 --> 06:26:01,460
Where's this fucking bear?

1340
06:26:07,460 --> 06:26:12,460
Left side?

1341
06:26:12,460 --> 06:26:17,460
Over here?

1342
06:26:25,460 --> 06:26:30,460
Bear, where for art thou, bear?

1343
06:26:30,460 --> 06:26:35,460
Is it that big ass bear that scratches the tree?

1344
06:26:40,460 --> 06:26:45,460
Oh my god, that scared the absolute shit out of me.

1345
06:26:45,460 --> 06:26:50,460
Unnecessarily loud.

1346
06:26:50,460 --> 06:26:55,460
Ugh, I'm irritated so you guys are gonna die.

1347
06:26:56,460 --> 06:27:01,460
You gonna run away?

1348
06:27:01,460 --> 06:27:06,460
Bitch.

1349
06:27:14,460 --> 06:27:19,460
Oh no, it's just a trap.

1350
06:27:19,460 --> 06:27:24,460
They just laid shit out for me and I fell for it.

1351
06:27:24,460 --> 06:27:29,460
I'm just saying that it's right over around here and it's not.

1352
06:27:38,460 --> 06:27:43,460
I'm just gonna stay up here for a second.

1353
06:27:43,460 --> 06:27:50,460
No, I am, cause I'm like there is a fucking dungeon and I can't remember and it's this big ass white bear.

1354
06:27:50,460 --> 06:27:55,460
I believe, or just like white one.

1355
06:27:55,460 --> 06:28:00,460
I don't remember.

1356
06:28:00,460 --> 06:28:05,460
I'm not spell drained.

1357
06:28:05,460 --> 06:28:10,460
No, I'm not.

1358
06:28:10,460 --> 06:28:15,460
Perfect.

1359
06:28:20,460 --> 06:28:25,460
Wait, they did it.

1360
06:28:25,460 --> 06:28:30,460
They went to the school of sorcery. What the fuck is this other guy telling me?

1361
06:28:36,460 --> 06:28:41,460
First light of the torches. Do I have to really do it? No, this isn't it.

1362
06:28:41,460 --> 06:28:46,460
Do not recall it being difficult.

1363
06:28:46,460 --> 06:28:51,460
I don't remember.

1364
06:29:02,460 --> 06:29:07,460
Inside the earth bore cave.

1365
06:29:07,460 --> 06:29:12,460
Where is the fucking earth bore cave?

1366
06:29:16,460 --> 06:29:21,460
It's showing that the cave is right around here.

1367
06:29:21,460 --> 06:29:26,460
Oh my god, I almost jumped across that.

1368
06:29:26,460 --> 06:29:31,460
Where is the earth bore cave?

1369
06:29:31,460 --> 06:29:36,460
Oh, maybe it's below.

1370
06:29:36,460 --> 06:29:41,460
Yeah.

1371
06:29:41,460 --> 06:29:46,460
Oh my god, I almost jumped across that.

1372
06:29:46,460 --> 06:29:51,460
Where is the earth bore cave? Is it? Oh, maybe it's below.

1373
06:29:51,460 --> 06:29:56,460
Yeah, right over here.

1374
06:29:56,460 --> 06:30:01,460
This has to be a cave over here.

1375
06:30:01,460 --> 06:30:06,460
Thank you.

1376
06:30:06,460 --> 06:30:11,460
Oh, nifty.

1377
06:30:16,460 --> 06:30:21,460
Oh.

1378
06:30:21,460 --> 06:30:26,460
This is fun.

1379
06:30:26,460 --> 06:30:31,460
Why is this rat so strong?

1380
06:30:31,460 --> 06:30:36,460
Alright, where is this fucking bear?

1381
06:30:36,460 --> 06:30:41,460
I forgot that this little thingy drops you.

1382
06:30:41,460 --> 06:30:46,460
Probably shouldn't just be dropping really nearly,

1383
06:30:46,460 --> 06:30:51,460
but I'm just kind of just trying to speed around this.

1384
06:30:51,460 --> 06:30:56,460
Bear. Oh, thank you.

1385
06:30:56,460 --> 06:31:01,460
Oh, you're way stronger than I thought you'd be.

1386
06:31:11,460 --> 06:31:16,460
Oh.

1387
06:31:16,460 --> 06:31:21,460
Fuck.

1388
06:31:21,460 --> 06:31:26,460
Can I get up there?

1389
06:31:26,460 --> 06:31:31,460
That is a good thing.

1390
06:31:31,460 --> 06:31:36,460
Fucking slapping me one, trying to drink.

1391
06:31:36,460 --> 06:31:41,460
Killers are killed by a bear.

1392
06:31:41,460 --> 06:31:46,460
I don't have to have my own kind in this cave.

1393
06:31:46,460 --> 06:31:51,460
Huh.

1394
06:31:51,460 --> 06:31:56,460
Nice try.

1395
06:31:56,460 --> 06:32:01,460
Oh.

1396
06:32:01,460 --> 06:32:06,460
Nice try.

1397
06:32:06,460 --> 06:32:11,460
It was a pickled turtle.

1398
06:32:11,460 --> 06:32:16,460
This is awkward.

1399
06:32:22,460 --> 06:32:27,460
What are you doing, Fia?

1400
06:32:27,460 --> 06:32:32,460
Why are you using my footrest as a cat scratcher?

1401
06:32:32,460 --> 06:32:37,460
I feel like how it's the whole fucking boss thing.

1402
06:32:37,460 --> 06:32:42,460
I know.

1403
06:32:57,460 --> 06:33:02,460
I'm stuck in the bear.

1404
06:33:27,460 --> 06:33:32,460
Fuck.

1405
06:33:32,460 --> 06:33:37,460
Fuck.

1406
06:33:37,460 --> 06:33:42,460
Fuck.

1407
06:33:42,460 --> 06:33:47,460
Fuck.

1408
06:33:47,460 --> 06:33:52,460
Fuck.

1409
06:33:52,460 --> 06:33:56,460
Fuck.

1410
06:33:57,460 --> 06:34:02,460
She died already. Jesus Christ.

1411
06:34:07,460 --> 06:34:12,460
The crazy part is the room bear isn't even the strongest one.

1412
06:34:12,460 --> 06:34:17,460
Bear is angry because I came into its home.

1413
06:34:17,460 --> 06:34:22,460
I mean, you did just come into it.

1414
06:34:22,460 --> 06:34:27,460
Well, it was sleeping and I just kind of walked in and attacked me first.

1415
06:34:27,460 --> 06:34:32,460
Like, let's be real.

1416
06:34:32,460 --> 06:34:37,460
Fuck.

1417
06:34:37,460 --> 06:34:42,460
Fuck.

1418
06:34:42,460 --> 06:34:47,460
Fuck.

1419
06:34:47,460 --> 06:34:52,460
Cool. All right, we did that.

1420
06:34:52,460 --> 06:34:57,460
Fia, can you please stop chewing on my headphones, darling?

1421
06:34:57,460 --> 06:35:02,460
Can I, can you give this back to me?

1422
06:35:02,460 --> 06:35:07,460
Thank you.

1423
06:35:07,460 --> 06:35:12,460
What's up?

1424
06:35:12,460 --> 06:35:17,460
Give me a little kiss.

1425
06:35:17,460 --> 06:35:22,460
Feels like a doll.

1426
06:35:22,460 --> 06:35:27,460
Fader arc? Oh my God.

1427
06:35:27,460 --> 06:35:32,460
Fia, you wanna come snuck?

1428
06:35:32,460 --> 06:35:37,460
Yes.

1429
06:35:37,460 --> 06:35:42,460
Hmm.

1430
06:35:42,460 --> 06:35:47,460
Let me do a little bit more research.

1431
06:36:02,460 --> 06:36:07,460
She says that she's just weak to bleeding and I'm like, well, I tried that.

1432
06:36:07,460 --> 06:36:12,460
I tried to make her bleed.

1433
06:36:12,460 --> 06:36:17,460
It didn't work out.

1434
06:36:17,460 --> 06:36:22,460
It works for her if I can like spam on her for a little bit.

1435
06:36:22,460 --> 06:36:27,460
Honestly, I need more, I need more golden seeds.

1436
06:36:27,460 --> 06:36:32,460
So I can have more health.

1437
06:36:32,460 --> 06:36:37,460
Fia, can you please, what are you doing?

1438
06:36:37,460 --> 06:36:42,460
Come here.

1439
06:36:42,460 --> 06:36:47,460
What are you doing?

1440
06:36:47,460 --> 06:36:52,460
Come here.

1441
06:36:52,460 --> 06:36:57,460
Everything's unbending.

1442
06:36:57,460 --> 06:37:02,460
What, is that moving?

1443
06:37:02,460 --> 06:37:07,460
There's nothing around. I don't like regularly stare at stuff.

1444
06:37:07,460 --> 06:37:12,460
What are you doing?

1445
06:37:12,460 --> 06:37:17,460
What are you doing?

1446
06:37:17,460 --> 06:37:22,460
You leaving me?

1447
06:37:22,460 --> 06:37:27,460
Do what you must.

1448
06:37:27,460 --> 06:37:32,460
Hmm.

1449
06:37:32,460 --> 06:37:37,460
I don't think

1450
06:37:37,460 --> 06:37:42,460
I'll have enough.

1451
06:37:42,460 --> 06:37:48,460
You said that the other talisman

1452
06:37:48,460 --> 06:37:53,460
is around here.

1453
06:37:53,460 --> 06:37:58,460
You're the debate parlor, right?

1454
06:37:58,460 --> 06:38:03,460
I believe.

1455
06:38:03,460 --> 06:38:08,460
I can't really do anything with that because if I take off riding in Sore Seal,

1456
06:38:08,460 --> 06:38:14,460
then I'm not going to be able to wield

1457
06:38:14,460 --> 06:38:19,460
the Moon Veil.

1458
06:38:19,460 --> 06:38:24,460
I thought I was going to miss that.

1459
06:38:24,460 --> 06:38:29,460
What happened again?

1460
06:38:29,460 --> 06:38:34,460
I'm just giving my computer a little breaky poo.

1461
06:38:34,460 --> 06:38:39,460
So you can get him up at Sheeby.

1462
06:38:39,460 --> 06:38:45,460
Up at Sheeby making me feel

1463
06:38:45,460 --> 06:38:50,460
ways I've never felt before.

1464
06:38:50,460 --> 06:38:55,460
She's got a nice one.

1465
06:38:55,460 --> 06:39:00,460
At least I look nice.

1466
06:39:00,460 --> 06:39:05,460
That was a sick nasty outfit.

1467
06:39:05,460 --> 06:39:10,460
It poo.

1468
06:39:10,460 --> 06:39:15,460
Oh brother, this guy stinks.

1469
06:39:15,460 --> 06:39:20,460
And your character looks nice in game.

1470
06:39:20,460 --> 06:39:25,460
Thank you, thank you.

1471
06:39:25,460 --> 06:39:30,460
Just so I don't accidentally do shit.

1472
06:39:30,460 --> 06:39:35,460
My mother died.

1473
06:39:35,460 --> 06:39:40,460
My mother died.

1474
06:39:40,460 --> 06:39:45,460
These books fly everywhere.

1475
06:39:45,460 --> 06:39:50,460
You scratch my nose.

1476
06:39:50,460 --> 06:39:55,460
Ah, that's a fucking thingy.

1477
06:39:55,460 --> 06:40:00,460
Sorry.

1478
06:40:00,460 --> 06:40:05,460
Oh, boomy, why?

1479
06:40:05,460 --> 06:40:10,460
I can't see, boomy.

1480
06:40:10,460 --> 06:40:15,460
Okay, boomy, it's fine if you walk now,

1481
06:40:15,460 --> 06:40:20,460
because now I can just spam killing her.

1482
06:40:20,460 --> 06:40:25,460
Die, die, die, die.

1483
06:40:25,460 --> 06:40:30,460
Ah, back up, back up!

1484
06:40:30,460 --> 06:40:34,460
Ow.

1485
06:40:34,460 --> 06:40:39,460
Ow, I'm stuck, I'm stuck, I'm stuck!

1486
06:40:39,460 --> 06:40:44,460
It's because I'm fucking locked on.

1487
06:40:44,460 --> 06:40:49,460
Oh my.

1488
06:40:49,460 --> 06:40:54,460
Boomy, could you please move?

1489
06:40:54,460 --> 06:40:59,460
You also were sitting in front of my screen.

1490
06:40:59,460 --> 06:41:04,460
As punishment, I hold you like a baby.

1491
06:41:04,460 --> 06:41:09,460
But you like being held like a baby.

1492
06:41:09,460 --> 06:41:14,460
I don't mind my boy.

1493
06:41:14,460 --> 06:41:19,460
Scratchy your chin.

1494
06:41:19,460 --> 06:41:24,460
No.

1495
06:41:24,460 --> 06:41:29,460
Sorry, I'm busy holding my son like a baby.

1496
06:41:29,460 --> 06:41:34,460
Because that's what he is, he is a baby.

1497
06:41:34,460 --> 06:41:39,460
He's the babyest baby that ever babyed.

1498
06:41:39,460 --> 06:41:44,460
He's making like airplane ears while I'm petting him,

1499
06:41:44,460 --> 06:41:49,460
it's kind of funny.

1500
06:41:49,460 --> 06:41:54,460
Big time attention hours.

1501
06:41:54,460 --> 06:41:59,460
Help me step up it, I'm stuck.

1502
06:41:59,460 --> 06:42:04,460
No, you can't leave.

1503
06:42:04,460 --> 06:42:09,460
It's my time, it's my time to snuggle you.

1504
06:42:09,460 --> 06:42:14,460
Mercy?

1505
06:42:14,460 --> 06:42:19,460
Scared the shit out of me.

1506
06:42:19,460 --> 06:42:24,460
That just terrified, oh my god.

1507
06:42:24,460 --> 06:42:29,460
Oh my, I'm so happy I wasn't doing anything

1508
06:42:29,460 --> 06:42:33,460
because I would have thrown my controller across the room.

1509
06:42:33,460 --> 06:42:38,460
Oh my god, everybody, everybody says hi.

1510
06:42:38,460 --> 06:42:43,460
Hello.

1511
06:42:43,460 --> 06:42:47,460
What was that?

1512
06:42:47,460 --> 06:42:52,460
My autonomous dog.

1513
06:42:52,460 --> 06:42:57,460
What? How does it do, is it like a sound board?

1514
06:42:57,460 --> 06:43:00,460
You know, you know, the little like.

1515
06:43:00,460 --> 06:43:04,460
Oh, like the thing, yeah, the like saying.

1516
06:43:04,460 --> 06:43:09,460
Yeah. Oh, I thought that was you.

1517
06:43:09,460 --> 06:43:11,460
No, seriously, it does sound like me sometimes.

1518
06:43:11,460 --> 06:43:13,460
Come on, let me show you.

1519
06:43:13,460 --> 06:43:18,460
Play me a song.

1520
06:43:18,460 --> 06:43:20,460
Play you a song?

1521
06:43:20,460 --> 06:43:22,460
Yeah, yeah.

1522
06:43:22,460 --> 06:43:42,460
Happy birthday to me.

1523
06:43:42,460 --> 06:43:44,460
That was gorgeous.

1524
06:43:44,460 --> 06:43:47,460
Everybody clap, clap for Mercy everyone.

1525
06:43:47,460 --> 06:43:49,460
My chat is very impressed.

1526
06:43:49,460 --> 06:43:51,460
The resemblance is on candy.

1527
06:43:51,460 --> 06:43:55,460
So it's between you and the little music note thingy.

1528
06:43:55,460 --> 06:43:58,460
Oh, I'm dead.

1529
06:43:58,460 --> 06:44:00,460
Especially if you shake it, you can like shake it off.

1530
06:44:00,460 --> 06:44:04,460
Oh my god.

1531
06:44:04,460 --> 06:44:07,460
What the hell, I want one.

1532
06:44:07,460 --> 06:44:10,460
It's like, it's like.

1533
06:44:10,460 --> 06:44:14,460
Here, you know what to do.

1534
06:44:14,460 --> 06:44:18,460
New suggested gift, that's one of those.

1535
06:44:18,460 --> 06:44:21,460
Automaton, is that what it's called?

1536
06:44:21,460 --> 06:44:23,460
Automaton.

1537
06:44:23,460 --> 06:44:25,460
Automaton, that's cool.

1538
06:44:25,460 --> 06:44:29,460
Mercy sounds like an automaton.

1539
06:44:29,460 --> 06:44:31,460
That's what somebody said.

1540
06:44:31,460 --> 06:44:42,460
I mean, I do like it's uncanny.

1541
06:44:42,460 --> 06:44:44,460
Mercy's just screaming in my chat.

1542
06:44:44,460 --> 06:44:47,460
That's what's happening if you just come in.

1543
06:44:47,460 --> 06:44:50,460
Sorry, I saw you were on the open mic and I went,

1544
06:44:50,460 --> 06:44:55,460
can I troll Shibby?

1545
06:44:55,460 --> 06:44:57,460
That's so scary.

1546
06:44:57,460 --> 06:45:00,460
I was so like, I was like locked in, like thinking about,

1547
06:45:00,460 --> 06:45:02,460
okay, what do I have to do next in this game?

1548
06:45:02,460 --> 06:45:07,460
And then it heard.

1549
06:45:07,460 --> 06:45:08,460
Thank you.

1550
06:45:08,460 --> 06:45:12,460
I needed to laugh because I'm starting to get angry.

1551
06:45:12,460 --> 06:45:15,460
Oh my god.

1552
06:45:15,460 --> 06:45:21,460
Well, how are you doing?

1553
06:45:21,460 --> 06:45:22,460
I'm doing great.

1554
06:45:22,460 --> 06:45:23,460
How are you?

1555
06:45:23,460 --> 06:45:26,460
How's Elden Ring?

1556
06:45:26,460 --> 06:45:28,460
Elden Ring's fine.

1557
06:45:28,460 --> 06:45:30,460
Have you ever played Elden Ring?

1558
06:45:30,460 --> 06:45:34,460
No, I'm not ready for souls like yet.

1559
06:45:34,460 --> 06:45:35,460
You're not ready?

1560
06:45:35,460 --> 06:45:38,460
Yeah, I think the motion sickness would actually get to you.

1561
06:45:38,460 --> 06:45:41,460
Yeah, it would be tough.

1562
06:45:41,460 --> 06:45:42,460
That sucks.

1563
06:45:42,460 --> 06:45:45,460
But yeah, it's going well.

1564
06:45:45,460 --> 06:45:47,460
Are you streaming today?

1565
06:45:47,460 --> 06:45:48,460
I am.

1566
06:45:48,460 --> 06:45:52,460
Later though, like in like three hours?

1567
06:45:52,460 --> 06:45:53,460
Two or three hours?

1568
06:45:53,460 --> 06:45:55,460
Roughly three hours, yeah.

1569
06:45:55,460 --> 06:46:00,460
If I'm still around, I'll wade right into you then.

1570
06:46:00,460 --> 06:46:02,460
If I make it that long.

1571
06:46:02,460 --> 06:46:04,460
Yeah, no problem about it.

1572
06:46:04,460 --> 06:46:05,460
Sorry to disturb.

1573
06:46:05,460 --> 06:46:06,460
I just wanted to...

1574
06:46:06,460 --> 06:46:07,460
No, no, you did not disturb.

1575
06:46:07,460 --> 06:46:11,460
Azura did the same thing yesterday.

1576
06:46:11,460 --> 06:46:20,460
I know, I don't know why.

1577
06:46:20,460 --> 06:46:24,460
I'm not hearing people come in when they like go into the discord.

1578
06:46:24,460 --> 06:46:25,460
It's funny.

1579
06:46:25,460 --> 06:46:26,460
It's only in this channel.

1580
06:46:26,460 --> 06:46:27,460
It doesn't work.

1581
06:46:27,460 --> 06:46:29,460
I wonder why.

1582
06:46:29,460 --> 06:46:31,460
Anyways, sir.

1583
06:46:31,460 --> 06:46:36,460
I have a lovely surprise.

1584
06:46:36,460 --> 06:46:38,460
Thank you.

1585
06:46:38,460 --> 06:46:41,460
No problem.

1586
06:46:41,460 --> 06:46:46,460
The dark yandere, everybody.

1587
06:46:46,460 --> 06:46:48,460
Oh my God.

1588
06:46:48,460 --> 06:46:50,460
I love you.

1589
06:46:50,460 --> 06:46:53,460
Love you too, hearts.

1590
06:46:53,460 --> 06:46:55,460
Huggy.

1591
06:46:55,460 --> 06:46:58,460
Make sure you beat the bad guy or the good guy.

1592
06:46:58,460 --> 06:47:01,460
I don't actually know if you're the good guy or bad guy in Elden Ring.

1593
06:47:01,460 --> 06:47:03,460
I'm both, essentially.

1594
06:47:03,460 --> 06:47:05,460
Yeah, that's it.

1595
06:47:05,460 --> 06:47:07,460
I can be either.

1596
06:47:07,460 --> 06:47:09,460
Oh my God.

1597
06:47:09,460 --> 06:47:13,460
My chat is sending their love.

1598
06:47:13,460 --> 06:47:15,460
I love your chat too.

1599
06:47:15,460 --> 06:47:17,460
Hello, Hera.

1600
06:47:17,460 --> 06:47:18,460
Be nice.

1601
06:47:18,460 --> 06:47:25,460
I mean, actually, I think she'd be supposed to be the one to be nice.

1602
06:47:25,460 --> 06:47:26,460
Never mind.

1603
06:47:26,460 --> 06:47:28,460
I've been beating them all day.

1604
06:47:28,460 --> 06:47:30,460
Yeah.

1605
06:47:30,460 --> 06:47:34,460
Torturing them with my Elden Ring gameplay.

1606
06:47:34,460 --> 06:47:36,460
I'm sure you're great.

1607
06:47:36,460 --> 06:47:39,460
You are the resident, one of the residents.

1608
06:47:39,460 --> 06:47:43,460
Uh, souls like.

1609
06:47:43,460 --> 06:47:48,460
I'm sure it's fine.

1610
06:47:48,460 --> 06:47:51,460
It's fine.

1611
06:47:51,460 --> 06:47:53,460
She'd be extremely serious.

1612
06:47:53,460 --> 06:47:55,460
Oh yeah, and happy 4th of July.

1613
06:47:55,460 --> 06:47:56,460
Thank you.

1614
06:47:56,460 --> 06:47:59,460
Happy Canada Day for a couple days ago.

1615
06:47:59,460 --> 06:48:05,460
It's so funny how that are independent days or whatever they are.

1616
06:48:05,460 --> 06:48:09,460
Old or like the days of each other.

1617
06:48:09,460 --> 06:48:12,460
It's always funny.

1618
06:48:12,460 --> 06:48:14,460
Do you get fireworks?

1619
06:48:14,460 --> 06:48:16,460
We get fireworks.

1620
06:48:16,460 --> 06:48:21,460
I think they're doing fireworks around the 6th.

1621
06:48:21,460 --> 06:48:22,460
Oh, okay.

1622
06:48:22,460 --> 06:48:23,460
That's kind of late.

1623
06:48:23,460 --> 06:48:26,460
Yeah, they like, it's like my town desert or whatever.

1624
06:48:26,460 --> 06:48:31,460
And so they're going to be blown off right by my house.

1625
06:48:31,460 --> 06:48:34,460
I feel like because I, and it's going to be.

1626
06:48:34,460 --> 06:48:38,460
I'm wondering if I'm, I have to check the time if I'm streaming at that time.

1627
06:48:38,460 --> 06:48:41,460
Cause then somebody said, I should do ASMR.

1628
06:48:41,460 --> 06:48:47,460
You're being shelled by heart artillery and your mommy is trying to rush you to safety.

1629
06:48:47,460 --> 06:48:50,460
Wait, that's a good plot.

1630
06:48:50,460 --> 06:48:51,460
What the heck?

1631
06:48:51,460 --> 06:48:52,460
I know.

1632
06:48:52,460 --> 06:48:53,460
I'm like, actually.

1633
06:48:53,460 --> 06:48:54,460
Perfect.

1634
06:48:54,460 --> 06:48:56,460
Actually, that might work.

1635
06:48:56,460 --> 06:48:58,460
That's not just might work.

1636
06:48:58,460 --> 06:49:02,460
No, that's really good.

1637
06:49:02,460 --> 06:49:06,460
One of my viewers came up with it.

1638
06:49:06,460 --> 06:49:09,460
Gosh, viewers have like the best ideas.

1639
06:49:09,460 --> 06:49:11,460
They really do.

1640
06:49:11,460 --> 06:49:13,460
Yeah, it's mine now.

1641
06:49:13,460 --> 06:49:15,460
Actually, I came up with it.

1642
06:49:15,460 --> 06:49:17,460
Sorry guys.

1643
06:49:17,460 --> 06:49:20,460
It's all my idea and my little Muppet brain.

1644
06:49:20,460 --> 06:49:22,460
That's where it came from.

1645
06:49:22,460 --> 06:49:24,460
Did you see my Muppet form yet, Mercy?

1646
06:49:24,460 --> 06:49:25,460
I did.

1647
06:49:25,460 --> 06:49:31,460
I noticed I was like, oh my gosh, you could actually put your model behind the Muppet because it's your hand.

1648
06:49:31,460 --> 06:49:32,460
Yeah.

1649
06:49:32,460 --> 06:49:33,460
Somebody did such a good job.

1650
06:49:33,460 --> 06:49:35,460
I love it.

1651
06:49:35,460 --> 06:49:37,460
It looks really good.

1652
06:49:37,460 --> 06:49:40,460
It looks so seductive.

1653
06:49:40,460 --> 06:49:41,460
I know.

1654
06:49:41,460 --> 06:49:44,460
I'm a little seductive Muppet.

1655
06:49:44,460 --> 06:49:49,460
Would you put your hand up her?

1656
06:49:49,460 --> 06:49:57,460
They already said they would make me into one of their socks.

1657
06:49:57,460 --> 06:50:06,460
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1658
06:50:06,460 --> 06:50:09,460
They're also saying I'm a furry because I'm a Muppet.

1659
06:50:09,460 --> 06:50:10,460
I don't know how that works.

1660
06:50:10,460 --> 06:50:11,460
I don't know.

1661
06:50:11,460 --> 06:50:13,460
You were already a furry.

1662
06:50:13,460 --> 06:50:15,460
You're a bunny.

1663
06:50:15,460 --> 06:50:18,460
I'm a kemama mamimi.

1664
06:50:18,460 --> 06:50:21,460
That's like, you know, just one step away from furry.

1665
06:50:21,460 --> 06:50:22,460
I'm sorry.

1666
06:50:22,460 --> 06:50:23,460
I'm in denial.

1667
06:50:23,460 --> 06:50:25,460
I'm not accepting it.

1668
06:50:25,460 --> 06:50:26,460
Don't die.

1669
06:50:26,460 --> 06:50:27,460
No.

1670
06:50:27,460 --> 06:50:28,460
It's okay.

1671
06:50:28,460 --> 06:50:29,460
I'm joking.

1672
06:50:29,460 --> 06:50:30,460
I'm choking.

1673
06:50:30,460 --> 06:50:35,460
I'm choking on your love.

1674
06:50:35,460 --> 06:50:36,460
Okay.

1675
06:50:36,460 --> 06:50:44,460
That's a way to phrase that.

1676
06:50:44,460 --> 06:50:49,460
But yeah, you're already furry.

1677
06:50:49,460 --> 06:50:50,460
I'm sorry.

1678
06:50:51,460 --> 06:50:59,460
At this point, you're probably, you know, you're probably like so close to like the

1679
06:50:59,460 --> 06:51:08,460
saw, you know, the jigsaw, like fan fictions and fan arts.

1680
06:51:08,460 --> 06:51:09,460
Excuse me.

1681
06:51:09,460 --> 06:51:14,460
No, she calls it like this.

1682
06:51:14,460 --> 06:51:15,460
She sees them.

1683
06:51:15,460 --> 06:51:16,460
No, she has an eye patch on.

1684
06:51:16,460 --> 06:51:18,460
She doesn't know what she's seeing.

1685
06:51:18,460 --> 06:51:24,460
I'm partially blind.

1686
06:51:24,460 --> 06:51:25,460
Oh my God.

1687
06:51:25,460 --> 06:51:26,460
Am I projecting?

1688
06:51:26,460 --> 06:51:27,460
No.

1689
06:51:27,460 --> 06:51:28,460
Of course.

1690
06:51:28,460 --> 06:51:29,460
Oh my God.

1691
06:51:29,460 --> 06:51:30,460
All right.

1692
06:51:30,460 --> 06:51:32,460
Is Vila just a bunch of furries?

1693
06:51:32,460 --> 06:51:34,460
Are we all just furries?

1694
06:51:34,460 --> 06:51:35,460
Yeah.

1695
06:51:35,460 --> 06:51:36,460
Okay.

1696
06:51:36,460 --> 06:51:40,460
I'll accept it if I'm not alone.

1697
06:51:40,460 --> 06:51:41,460
Yeah.

1698
06:51:41,460 --> 06:51:43,460
Look, look at me.

1699
06:51:43,460 --> 06:51:44,460
Look at Amy.

1700
06:51:44,460 --> 06:51:46,460
Heck, we even have icy.

1701
06:51:46,460 --> 06:51:49,460
There's a cuttlefish.

1702
06:51:49,460 --> 06:51:51,460
That's a scaly.

1703
06:51:51,460 --> 06:51:52,460
That's true.

1704
06:51:52,460 --> 06:51:53,460
Is that a scaly?

1705
06:51:53,460 --> 06:51:55,460
I think scaly's are reptiles.

1706
06:51:55,460 --> 06:51:57,460
Oh, shit, really?

1707
06:51:57,460 --> 06:51:59,460
Wait, why did I know that?

1708
06:51:59,460 --> 06:52:01,460
Fuck.

1709
06:52:01,460 --> 06:52:06,460
Mercy, how are you furry?

1710
06:52:06,460 --> 06:52:08,460
Is there isn't an animal?

1711
06:52:08,460 --> 06:52:11,460
Are you not saying that humans are not animals?

1712
06:52:11,460 --> 06:52:15,460
She has a point.

1713
06:52:15,460 --> 06:52:20,460
Oh my God.

1714
06:52:20,460 --> 06:52:21,460
Okay.

1715
06:52:21,460 --> 06:52:25,460
I'm going to attempt to continue with my boss.

1716
06:52:25,460 --> 06:52:26,460
I love you.

1717
06:52:26,460 --> 06:52:28,460
I'll leave you be now.

1718
06:52:28,460 --> 06:52:29,460
I love you too.

1719
06:52:29,460 --> 06:52:30,460
Bye, Mercy.

1720
06:52:30,460 --> 06:52:31,460
See you later.

1721
06:52:31,460 --> 06:52:33,460
I just wanted to spook you.

1722
06:52:33,460 --> 06:52:34,460
Oh, he works.

1723
06:52:34,460 --> 06:52:36,460
I call you furry, I guess.

1724
06:52:36,460 --> 06:52:37,460
No.

1725
06:52:37,460 --> 06:52:38,460
My.

1726
06:52:38,460 --> 06:52:40,460
I love her.

1727
06:52:40,460 --> 06:52:44,460
She's great.

1728
06:52:44,460 --> 06:52:51,460
She's scared of shit out of me.

1729
06:52:51,460 --> 06:52:56,460
All right.

1730
06:52:56,460 --> 06:52:57,460
Don't go.

1731
06:52:57,460 --> 06:52:59,460
You'll see her later.

1732
06:52:59,460 --> 06:53:02,460
You know, she streams at 11 Eastern time.

1733
06:53:02,460 --> 06:53:08,460
She'll be around in a couple hours.

1734
06:53:08,460 --> 06:53:19,460
Yep.

1735
06:53:19,460 --> 06:53:24,460
Yeah.

1736
06:53:24,460 --> 06:53:36,460
What was that?

1737
06:53:36,460 --> 06:53:40,460
I didn't ask.

1738
06:53:40,460 --> 06:53:44,460
I realized I didn't run because it hits the second pillar over there.

1739
06:53:44,460 --> 06:53:48,460
You see where the point of my like bounces off of that then goes to the right.

1740
06:53:48,460 --> 06:54:01,460
And I was still close to the right when that happened.

1741
06:54:01,460 --> 06:54:04,460
I thought I was storming outside, but it's just the game.

1742
06:54:04,460 --> 06:54:05,460
I think.

1743
06:54:05,460 --> 06:54:06,460
Oh, wait.

1744
06:54:06,460 --> 06:54:08,460
No, if people throwing off fucking fireworks.

1745
06:54:08,460 --> 06:54:11,460
See, it bounces off that one.

1746
06:54:11,460 --> 06:54:13,460
And now I got a ride.

1747
06:54:13,460 --> 06:54:14,460
No.

1748
06:54:14,460 --> 06:54:15,460
Sorry.

1749
06:54:15,460 --> 06:54:17,460
It's the first one that bounces off of.

1750
06:54:17,460 --> 06:54:18,460
Wow.

1751
06:54:18,460 --> 06:54:23,460
All my rooms that I got back.

1752
06:54:23,460 --> 06:54:24,460
I wasn't.

1753
06:54:24,460 --> 06:54:25,460
No, I.

1754
06:54:25,460 --> 06:54:31,460
I'm not going to go to the boss after it hits me and knocks my health in half.

1755
06:54:31,460 --> 06:54:34,460
I'm just going to kill myself.

1756
06:54:34,460 --> 06:54:38,460
I'm just kill it because I don't like you have to make sure I have to make sure I'm at full

1757
06:54:38,460 --> 06:54:39,460
health.

1758
06:54:39,460 --> 06:54:52,460
I was just going to work otherwise, you know.

1759
06:54:52,460 --> 06:55:03,460
Oh, I'm hungry.

1760
06:55:03,460 --> 06:55:07,460
Ting.

1761
06:55:07,460 --> 06:55:09,460
Why isn't there?

1762
06:55:09,460 --> 06:55:12,460
I know there's a fucking.

1763
06:55:12,460 --> 06:55:20,460
It's like right here is a grace when you beat her, but yeah, we're doing the moon veil only

1764
06:55:20,460 --> 06:55:36,460
strat up until I get her to her second phase.

1765
06:55:36,460 --> 06:55:42,460
I'm getting fucking got by books.

1766
06:55:42,460 --> 06:55:45,460
Ow, ow.

1767
06:55:45,460 --> 06:55:46,460
You can't.

1768
06:55:46,460 --> 06:55:50,460
Go in the middle of them because they will fuck you up.

1769
06:55:50,460 --> 06:55:51,460
Fuck off.

1770
06:55:51,460 --> 06:55:55,460
You fucking books.

1771
06:55:55,460 --> 06:55:56,460
Sleep tight.

1772
06:55:56,460 --> 06:55:59,460
Shut the fuck up.

1773
06:55:59,460 --> 06:56:04,460
I'm down here, lady.

1774
06:56:04,460 --> 06:56:09,460
I'm missing.

1775
06:56:09,460 --> 06:56:16,460
Thank you.

1776
06:56:16,460 --> 06:56:25,460
Okay.

1777
06:56:25,460 --> 06:56:43,460
I need to see where she's going to throw that.

1778
06:56:43,460 --> 06:56:46,460
This won't break.

1779
06:56:46,460 --> 06:56:47,460
Yeah.

1780
06:56:47,460 --> 06:56:52,460
Okay.

1781
06:56:52,460 --> 06:56:54,460
Bitch.

1782
06:56:54,460 --> 06:56:56,460
Bitch slapping children.

1783
06:56:56,460 --> 06:56:58,460
Oh my God.

1784
06:56:58,460 --> 06:57:06,460
That guy scared me.

1785
06:57:06,460 --> 06:57:07,460
Bitch.

1786
06:57:07,460 --> 06:57:08,460
I missed.

1787
06:57:08,460 --> 06:57:09,460
Bitch.

1788
06:57:09,460 --> 06:57:34,460
I still smells like burnt popcorn.

1789
06:57:34,460 --> 06:57:52,460
I wanted to break her before she did that little move.

1790
06:57:52,460 --> 06:58:02,460
Unlock.

1791
06:58:02,460 --> 06:58:09,460
She's over there.

1792
06:58:09,460 --> 06:58:12,460
Fuck.

1793
06:58:12,460 --> 06:58:22,460
Where is it?

1794
06:58:22,460 --> 06:58:33,460
Ow.

1795
06:58:33,460 --> 06:58:48,460
Ow.

1796
06:58:48,460 --> 06:58:58,460
I'm getting got by books.

1797
06:58:58,460 --> 06:59:04,460
Yeah, everybody just watch as I kill your mom.

1798
06:59:04,460 --> 06:59:11,460
Die.

1799
06:59:11,460 --> 06:59:13,460
Why are you hitting graduates?

1800
06:59:13,460 --> 06:59:15,460
Because I want to.

1801
06:59:15,460 --> 06:59:22,460
They're dumb little children.

1802
06:59:22,460 --> 06:59:35,460
Oh my God.

1803
06:59:35,460 --> 07:00:02,460
Oh, I'm so sick of you.

1804
07:00:03,460 --> 07:00:05,460
What?

1805
07:00:05,460 --> 07:00:06,460
What?

1806
07:00:06,460 --> 07:00:08,460
What?

1807
07:00:08,460 --> 07:00:10,460
Say it to my fucking muppet face.

1808
07:00:10,460 --> 07:00:18,460
Fucking end you.

1809
07:00:18,460 --> 07:00:21,460
I'd rather fucking fight Radon at this point.

1810
07:00:21,460 --> 07:00:25,460
This is just annoying.

1811
07:00:25,460 --> 07:00:27,460
It's a hard not life.

1812
07:00:27,460 --> 07:00:29,460
Knock.

1813
07:00:29,460 --> 07:00:31,460
I said not life.

1814
07:00:31,460 --> 07:00:35,460
It's a hard not life for us.

1815
07:00:35,460 --> 07:00:40,460
All my cat's food is going off instead of kibble.

1816
07:00:40,460 --> 07:00:44,460
We get treats.

1817
07:00:44,460 --> 07:00:56,460
Oh my God.

1818
07:00:56,460 --> 07:00:59,460
Would you really rather fight Radon?

1819
07:00:59,460 --> 07:01:02,460
I don't know, actually.

1820
07:01:02,460 --> 07:01:07,460
At least I could be on fucking torrent.

1821
07:01:07,460 --> 07:01:12,460
This person was like me and definitely ran off.

1822
07:01:12,460 --> 07:01:16,460
I want to punch the blood stain.

1823
07:01:16,460 --> 07:01:20,460
Oh no, that's they died that way.

1824
07:01:20,460 --> 07:01:22,460
You look pretty badass while you were doing it though.

1825
07:01:22,460 --> 07:01:27,460
You got Uchigatana or the Naga something.

1826
07:01:27,460 --> 07:01:29,460
I'm not a furry.

1827
07:01:29,460 --> 07:01:45,460
Oh my God.

1828
07:01:45,460 --> 07:02:05,460
I'm so sick of this song.

1829
07:02:05,460 --> 07:02:06,460
Oh, perfect.

1830
07:02:06,460 --> 07:02:07,460
Oh, I miss.

1831
07:02:07,460 --> 07:02:10,460
Die.

1832
07:02:10,460 --> 07:02:12,460
I'm locked on you.

1833
07:02:12,460 --> 07:02:15,460
Get down here.

1834
07:02:15,460 --> 07:02:28,460
No, not you.

1835
07:02:28,460 --> 07:02:34,460
No.

1836
07:02:34,460 --> 07:02:38,460
Sweetings.

1837
07:02:38,460 --> 07:02:41,460
Little Ting.

1838
07:02:41,460 --> 07:02:43,460
Oh, books.

1839
07:02:43,460 --> 07:02:48,460
Oh, fire.

1840
07:02:48,460 --> 07:02:52,460
Books are my one enemy in this game now.

1841
07:02:52,460 --> 07:02:54,460
I keep missing you.

1842
07:02:54,460 --> 07:02:55,460
I can't.

1843
07:02:55,460 --> 07:02:57,460
There's too many people to focus on.

1844
07:02:57,460 --> 07:03:06,460
It's hard for the camera to lock.

1845
07:03:06,460 --> 07:03:08,460
Fuck off.

1846
07:03:08,460 --> 07:03:13,460
Oh, fucking child landing on me.

1847
07:03:13,460 --> 07:03:17,460
Get down with your bad self.

1848
07:03:17,460 --> 07:03:21,460
Fucking slugs.

1849
07:03:21,460 --> 07:03:30,460
Your feet are big.

1850
07:03:31,460 --> 07:03:48,460
Ah.

1851
07:03:48,460 --> 07:03:50,460
Where is this one?

1852
07:03:50,460 --> 07:03:57,460
Alright, she is.

1853
07:03:57,460 --> 07:04:04,460
Not too bad.

1854
07:04:04,460 --> 07:04:14,460
They are going to fall.

1855
07:04:14,460 --> 07:04:24,460
Oh, fucking books.

1856
07:04:24,460 --> 07:04:37,460
I feel like Art of Muppets should be wearing a shroud.

1857
07:04:37,460 --> 07:04:38,460
It would be funny.

1858
07:04:38,460 --> 07:04:40,460
Jesus Christ.

1859
07:04:40,460 --> 07:04:49,460
That would be hilarious, actually.

1860
07:04:49,460 --> 07:04:58,460
Oh, why was that taking forever?

1861
07:04:58,460 --> 07:05:18,460
Do I have to go up close to you?

1862
07:05:18,460 --> 07:05:40,460
Okay, I realize it's better to roll towards her.

1863
07:05:40,460 --> 07:05:46,460
I'm running out of stamina, though.

1864
07:05:46,460 --> 07:05:53,460
No, I'm coming through.

1865
07:05:53,460 --> 07:05:56,460
Do I have to click it?

1866
07:05:56,460 --> 07:06:08,460
Oh, fuck you.

1867
07:06:08,460 --> 07:06:17,460
Fucking bitch.

1868
07:06:17,460 --> 07:06:23,460
Ow.

1869
07:06:23,460 --> 07:06:24,460
No, no, I don't want to die.

1870
07:06:24,460 --> 07:06:29,460
I don't want to die.

1871
07:06:29,460 --> 07:06:35,460
I just get the timing right for that one.

1872
07:06:35,460 --> 07:06:37,460
Oh, no.

1873
07:06:37,460 --> 07:06:38,460
I'm attacking you.

1874
07:06:38,460 --> 07:06:41,460
I don't care about any of that shit.

1875
07:06:41,460 --> 07:06:52,460
Nope, nope.

1876
07:06:52,460 --> 07:07:02,460
You're mine.

1877
07:07:02,460 --> 07:07:10,460
Hold on.

1878
07:07:10,460 --> 07:07:19,460
Fuck off.

1879
07:07:19,460 --> 07:07:21,460
Oh.

1880
07:07:21,460 --> 07:07:23,460
Stop it.

1881
07:07:23,460 --> 07:07:25,460
Enough.

1882
07:07:25,460 --> 07:07:27,460
You're done, Manala.

1883
07:07:27,460 --> 07:07:28,460
Sit.

1884
07:07:28,460 --> 07:07:37,460
Get fucking...

1885
07:07:37,460 --> 07:07:42,460
Yeah.

1886
07:07:42,460 --> 07:07:47,460
Yeah.

1887
07:07:47,460 --> 07:07:49,460
First try.

1888
07:07:49,460 --> 07:07:51,460
100% first try.

1889
07:07:51,460 --> 07:07:55,460
I think one of that only took me like seven tries?

1890
07:07:55,460 --> 07:07:57,460
Eight tries, maybe ten?

1891
07:07:57,460 --> 07:08:00,460
I don't know.

1892
07:08:00,460 --> 07:08:05,460
That'll go through close for loose change.

1893
07:08:05,460 --> 07:08:14,460
Yeah, I'll be right back.

1894
07:08:14,460 --> 07:08:23,460
Hey.

1895
07:08:23,460 --> 07:08:26,460
Me.

1896
07:08:26,460 --> 07:08:32,460
I need shit for that.

1897
07:08:32,460 --> 07:08:35,460
I'm a gamer.

1898
07:08:35,460 --> 07:08:37,460
Pulling those dodges off.

1899
07:08:37,460 --> 07:08:38,460
I'm telling you.

1900
07:08:38,460 --> 07:08:44,460
A pee really helps me with Eleanor because I would not be able to do this normally.

1901
07:08:44,460 --> 07:08:52,460
Normally I could not get dodges right and I literally would just either cheese a boss

1902
07:08:52,460 --> 07:08:54,460
or I just spam shit.

1903
07:08:54,460 --> 07:09:01,460
But I'm actually pretty proud of myself that this run I am actually like dodging.

1904
07:09:01,460 --> 07:09:25,460
I would be parrying too if I was doing that sort of build but I'm not.

1905
07:09:25,460 --> 07:09:29,460
I know I'm no gamer but I'm not like painfully bad.

1906
07:09:29,460 --> 07:09:44,460
But I'm not painfully bad.

1907
07:09:44,460 --> 07:09:45,460
Perseverance.

1908
07:09:45,460 --> 07:09:46,460
That's my word.

1909
07:09:46,460 --> 07:09:47,460
That's my word this year.

1910
07:09:47,460 --> 07:09:50,460
Perseverance.

1911
07:09:50,460 --> 07:09:55,460
I'm entertainingly bad.

1912
07:09:55,460 --> 07:09:57,460
I'm not a gamer at the end of this playthrough.

1913
07:09:57,460 --> 07:09:59,460
A true gamer.

1914
07:09:59,460 --> 07:10:11,460
Sick.

1915
07:10:11,460 --> 07:10:13,460
You're kind of weird.

1916
07:10:13,460 --> 07:10:19,460
You're just a bit weird.

1917
07:10:19,460 --> 07:10:21,460
Is it audio skipping for anyone else?

1918
07:10:21,460 --> 07:10:22,460
Is it audio skipping?

1919
07:10:22,460 --> 07:10:24,460
I don't know.

1920
07:10:24,460 --> 07:10:25,460
I went through a lot.

1921
07:10:25,460 --> 07:10:39,460
I can't really lock her for it.

1922
07:10:39,460 --> 07:10:40,460
Okay.

1923
07:10:40,460 --> 07:10:43,460
Let me do...

1924
07:10:43,460 --> 07:10:46,460
Should I do more intelligence?

1925
07:10:46,460 --> 07:10:47,460
Yeah.

1926
07:10:47,460 --> 07:10:52,460
I feel like that's good.

1927
07:10:52,460 --> 07:10:57,460
Because then I won't need Radigan's Scar Seal to fucking wield this.

1928
07:10:57,460 --> 07:11:06,460
I don't think.

1929
07:11:06,460 --> 07:11:08,460
Oh I need Strength and Dex.

1930
07:11:08,460 --> 07:11:09,460
Oh you're right.

1931
07:11:09,460 --> 07:11:12,460
Because I need 18 and I need 12.

1932
07:11:12,460 --> 07:11:13,460
Fuck.

1933
07:11:13,460 --> 07:11:19,460
I wish I read that before.

1934
07:11:19,460 --> 07:11:20,460
Fuck.

1935
07:11:20,460 --> 07:11:24,460
It's fine.

1936
07:11:24,460 --> 07:11:25,460
It's fine.

1937
07:11:25,460 --> 07:11:29,460
What does her green do?

1938
07:11:29,460 --> 07:11:30,460
I don't know.

1939
07:11:30,460 --> 07:11:31,460
I don't have it yet.

1940
07:11:31,460 --> 07:11:32,460
It doesn't really matter.

1941
07:11:32,460 --> 07:11:33,460
Yeah.

1942
07:11:33,460 --> 07:11:36,460
It's just two more levels.

1943
07:11:36,460 --> 07:11:37,460
In fact.

1944
07:11:37,460 --> 07:11:40,460
Oh shit.

1945
07:11:40,460 --> 07:11:49,460
I haven't been doing any crafting or nothing.

1946
07:11:49,460 --> 07:11:54,460
Do I need to go somewhere to do her rune?

1947
07:11:54,460 --> 07:11:55,460
I don't have to.

1948
07:11:55,460 --> 07:11:56,460
Right?

1949
07:11:56,460 --> 07:11:57,460
Oh.

1950
07:11:57,460 --> 07:12:04,460
I don't have to.

1951
07:12:04,460 --> 07:12:05,460
Oh.

1952
07:12:05,460 --> 07:12:06,460
Yeah.

1953
07:12:06,460 --> 07:12:11,460
Is it Ronnie's wedding ring in there?

1954
07:12:11,460 --> 07:12:13,460
I need a larvae.

1955
07:12:13,460 --> 07:12:14,460
That's right.

1956
07:12:14,460 --> 07:12:16,460
I would need a larvae.

1957
07:12:16,460 --> 07:12:17,460
Larva.

1958
07:12:17,460 --> 07:12:18,460
Larvae.

1959
07:12:18,460 --> 07:12:22,460
I don't know what the fuck I'm saying.

1960
07:12:22,460 --> 07:12:23,460
That's true.

1961
07:12:23,460 --> 07:12:24,460
I could use the Remembrances.

1962
07:12:24,460 --> 07:12:27,460
Because I don't really care about the items.

1963
07:12:27,460 --> 07:12:30,460
The only item I care about is Radon's bow.

1964
07:12:30,460 --> 07:12:36,460
Because I'm going to need that for farming.

1965
07:12:37,460 --> 07:12:57,460
I might as well do that now then.

1966
07:12:57,460 --> 07:12:58,460
Wait.

1967
07:12:58,460 --> 07:12:59,460
Do I have to go to the fucking...

1968
07:12:59,460 --> 07:13:20,460
I was like, where is it?

1969
07:13:20,460 --> 07:13:27,460
I might as well just go here first.

1970
07:13:27,460 --> 07:13:41,460
Do I only have...

1971
07:13:41,460 --> 07:13:42,460
I don't...

1972
07:13:42,460 --> 07:13:45,460
You're going to laugh at me, but I thought this was a helmet.

1973
07:13:45,460 --> 07:13:51,460
And I just realized it was Ronaldo.

1974
07:13:51,460 --> 07:13:52,460
I like how I just went past it.

1975
07:13:52,460 --> 07:13:54,460
And I was like, oh, where is it?

1976
07:13:54,460 --> 07:13:59,460
It's right fucking there.

1977
07:13:59,460 --> 07:14:00,460
Yeah.

1978
07:14:00,460 --> 07:14:01,460
Because what's hers?

1979
07:14:01,460 --> 07:14:02,460
Wait.

1980
07:14:02,460 --> 07:14:10,460
Before I do hers, does hers give a spell?

1981
07:14:10,460 --> 07:14:11,460
I don't want her funny hat.

1982
07:14:11,460 --> 07:14:16,460
I don't care about her funny hat.

1983
07:14:16,460 --> 07:14:26,460
I hate her hat so much.

1984
07:14:26,460 --> 07:14:28,460
Hers does give a spell.

1985
07:14:28,460 --> 07:14:29,460
Is it?

1986
07:14:29,460 --> 07:14:34,460
It's the comet, isn't it?

1987
07:14:34,460 --> 07:14:36,460
I'm not going to do hers then.

1988
07:14:36,460 --> 07:14:38,460
It's the moon bomb.

1989
07:14:38,460 --> 07:14:40,460
Oh, I never fucking even use that.

1990
07:14:40,460 --> 07:14:41,460
Never mind.

1991
07:14:41,460 --> 07:14:42,460
Yeah, that's right.

1992
07:14:42,460 --> 07:14:44,460
I recall now.

1993
07:14:44,460 --> 07:15:05,460
I think I got her funky little hat instead.

1994
07:15:05,460 --> 07:15:15,460
Yippee.

1995
07:15:15,460 --> 07:15:16,460
Yippee.

1996
07:15:16,460 --> 07:15:17,460
Her staff is good.

1997
07:15:17,460 --> 07:15:18,460
I don't really care.

1998
07:15:18,460 --> 07:15:28,460
It's one of the best staffs, but it isn't the best staff.

1999
07:15:28,460 --> 07:15:29,460
My staff's fine.

2000
07:15:29,460 --> 07:15:34,460
I can always get a better one late game.

2001
07:15:34,460 --> 07:15:42,460
Her staff is good, but what am I doing?

2002
07:15:42,460 --> 07:15:43,460
I'm looking fashionable.

2003
07:15:43,460 --> 07:15:44,460
That's what I'm doing.

2004
07:15:44,460 --> 07:15:47,460
What am I doing?

2005
07:15:47,460 --> 07:15:52,460
I totally forgot what I was going to do.

2006
07:15:52,460 --> 07:15:54,460
Oh, no.

2007
07:15:55,460 --> 07:16:05,460
Okay, I don't need that.

2008
07:16:05,460 --> 07:16:16,460
So now I can stop fucking myself over with that.

2009
07:16:16,460 --> 07:16:22,460
So where is the graven?

2010
07:16:22,460 --> 07:16:24,460
Damn.

2011
07:16:24,460 --> 07:16:26,460
Look at her feet.

2012
07:16:26,460 --> 07:16:27,460
Look at her soles.

2013
07:16:27,460 --> 07:16:29,460
She's a little dimple on her foot.

2014
07:16:29,460 --> 07:16:32,460
Interesting.

2015
07:16:32,460 --> 07:16:35,460
Anything else that I can see?

2016
07:16:35,460 --> 07:16:37,460
Oh, all right.

2017
07:16:37,460 --> 07:16:39,460
I hate your...

2018
07:16:39,460 --> 07:16:43,460
Your weirdly proportioned body is so disturbing to me.

2019
07:16:43,460 --> 07:16:46,460
It is generally uncanny valley and it bothers me so much.

2020
07:16:46,460 --> 07:16:47,460
Oh, wow.

2021
07:16:47,460 --> 07:16:48,460
Look who's that.

2022
07:16:48,460 --> 07:16:49,460
It's Radigan.

2023
07:16:49,460 --> 07:16:52,460
Fascinating.

2024
07:16:52,460 --> 07:17:07,460
So now we're going to get the school.

2025
07:17:07,460 --> 07:17:08,460
I'm looking at her feet.

2026
07:17:08,460 --> 07:17:09,460
Don't worry about it.

2027
07:17:09,460 --> 07:17:24,460
Don't worry about your own feet because I'm covering your feet.

2028
07:17:24,460 --> 07:17:29,460
Probably also...

2029
07:17:29,460 --> 07:17:47,460
There's another wonder physics.

2030
07:17:47,460 --> 07:18:07,460
Okay, okay, okay.

2031
07:18:07,460 --> 07:18:13,460
Not my grippers, madame.

2032
07:18:13,460 --> 07:18:16,460
Your grippers are not safe.

2033
07:18:16,460 --> 07:18:29,460
Exit the parlor.

2034
07:18:29,460 --> 07:18:32,460
There's an illusory wall.

2035
07:18:32,460 --> 07:18:36,460
Attack the bookshelf.

2036
07:18:36,460 --> 07:18:38,460
Oh, before the stairs.

2037
07:18:38,460 --> 07:18:40,460
For the stairs.

2038
07:18:40,460 --> 07:18:43,460
This one.

2039
07:18:43,460 --> 07:18:45,460
Where is it?

2040
07:18:45,460 --> 07:18:58,460
Oh, it's this one.

2041
07:18:58,460 --> 07:19:03,460
Sick, we got Comet.

2042
07:19:03,460 --> 07:19:06,460
All right, where is the ladder?

2043
07:19:06,460 --> 07:19:13,460
This is not the ladder you climb.

2044
07:19:13,460 --> 07:19:17,460
Follow the wall to a room with the ladder.

2045
07:19:17,460 --> 07:19:30,460
Oh, this one.

2046
07:19:30,460 --> 07:19:42,460
Sorry, I just wanted to break that.

2047
07:19:42,460 --> 07:19:49,460
Time for jumping.

2048
07:19:49,460 --> 07:20:00,460
I want to jump.

2049
07:20:00,460 --> 07:20:11,460
Do I have to go down?

2050
07:20:11,460 --> 07:20:13,460
That's a creepy little hole.

2051
07:20:13,460 --> 07:20:14,460
Let me go this way first.

2052
07:20:14,460 --> 07:20:15,460
There's nothing there.

2053
07:20:15,460 --> 07:20:23,460
Okay, we go down the creepy little hole.

2054
07:20:23,460 --> 07:20:28,460
Be wary of group.

2055
07:20:28,460 --> 07:20:30,460
I don't see anything.

2056
07:20:30,460 --> 07:20:33,460
Is it the jars?

2057
07:20:33,460 --> 07:20:48,460
I guess it is the jars.

2058
07:20:48,460 --> 07:21:01,460
How do I get out of here?

2059
07:21:01,460 --> 07:21:03,460
Walk with me, little jar.

2060
07:21:03,460 --> 07:21:07,460
Oh, never mind.

2061
07:21:07,460 --> 07:21:17,460
Now, now, fuck, shit.

2062
07:21:17,460 --> 07:21:19,460
Excuse me, pardon me.

2063
07:21:19,460 --> 07:21:23,460
Excuse me, pardon me.

2064
07:21:23,460 --> 07:21:32,460
She's in the walls.

2065
07:21:32,460 --> 07:21:38,460
Yeah, fuck, now I'm a heavy load.

2066
07:21:38,460 --> 07:21:41,460
Why am I going to fat roll?

2067
07:21:41,460 --> 07:21:44,460
Are you serious?

2068
07:21:44,460 --> 07:21:53,460
That's so stupid.

2069
07:21:53,460 --> 07:21:59,460
Actually, I don't really need the spells right now.

2070
07:21:59,460 --> 07:22:02,460
My microphone is in my face.

2071
07:22:02,460 --> 07:22:08,460
I'll put that back on.

2072
07:22:08,460 --> 07:22:10,460
It's still a heavy load.

2073
07:22:10,460 --> 07:22:13,460
Okay.

2074
07:22:13,460 --> 07:22:23,460
That's better.

2075
07:22:23,460 --> 07:22:25,460
Got one grim difference.

2076
07:22:25,460 --> 07:22:27,460
Broke a sand.

2077
07:22:27,460 --> 07:22:28,460
I know.

2078
07:22:28,460 --> 07:22:29,460
Just drop the shield.

2079
07:22:29,460 --> 07:22:30,460
Oh, yeah, what the fuck?

2080
07:22:30,460 --> 07:22:33,460
I have the shield on.

2081
07:22:33,460 --> 07:22:43,460
I need that shit.

2082
07:22:43,460 --> 07:22:54,460
I need those right now.

2083
07:22:54,460 --> 07:22:56,460
Now we big chillin'.

2084
07:22:56,460 --> 07:22:59,460
Okay.

2085
07:22:59,460 --> 07:23:07,460
So, we got Morgan, Godric, and Rinala.

2086
07:23:07,460 --> 07:23:19,460
Now we just need to...

2087
07:23:19,460 --> 07:23:30,460
I believe I have to go rest at a side of grace outside of this, right?

2088
07:23:30,460 --> 07:23:34,460
Or does this count?

2089
07:23:34,460 --> 07:23:48,460
Oh, fuck, do I get out of here anyways?

2090
07:23:48,460 --> 07:23:53,460
No.

2091
07:23:53,460 --> 07:23:57,460
Oh, my God, he's scared the fuck out of me.

2092
07:23:57,460 --> 07:24:02,460
Jesus Christ, he's scared the shit out of me.

2093
07:24:02,460 --> 07:24:10,460
Oh, I'm alive?

2094
07:24:10,460 --> 07:24:11,460
Oh, my God.

2095
07:24:11,460 --> 07:24:17,460
I just got a fucking shiver from that.

2096
07:24:17,460 --> 07:24:26,460
Okay, if it's redawn time, it's redawn time.

2097
07:24:26,460 --> 07:24:33,460
Fuck, I have to go really far.

2098
07:24:33,460 --> 07:24:34,460
I just don't like the noises they make.

2099
07:24:34,460 --> 07:24:42,460
It freaks me out.

2100
07:24:42,460 --> 07:24:44,460
Yeah, they do do way too much damage.

2101
07:24:44,460 --> 07:24:47,460
I don't know the type of damage that they do.

2102
07:24:47,460 --> 07:24:54,460
I don't know why I teleported all the way over here when I shifted down over here.

2103
07:24:54,460 --> 07:25:08,460
We'll see if it works, and we'll see if we can fuck up redawn.

2104
07:25:08,460 --> 07:25:31,460
Let's do it.

2105
07:25:31,460 --> 07:25:36,460
What's up with the music?

2106
07:25:36,460 --> 07:25:38,460
My favorite place to be.

2107
07:25:38,460 --> 07:25:41,460
Okay, look how beautiful sunny skies.

2108
07:25:41,460 --> 07:25:44,460
It's really gorgeous out.

2109
07:25:44,460 --> 07:25:46,460
Got a dude here.

2110
07:25:46,460 --> 07:25:49,460
I'll say hi.

2111
07:25:49,460 --> 07:25:54,460
What do you got?

2112
07:25:54,460 --> 07:25:57,460
I haven't even been using any of that stuff.

2113
07:25:57,460 --> 07:25:58,460
I haven't been crafting shit.

2114
07:25:58,460 --> 07:26:02,460
I haven't been doing anything.

2115
07:26:02,460 --> 07:26:04,460
I'll do all that later.

2116
07:26:04,460 --> 07:26:07,460
When I get to DLC, I'll focus on getting a lot.

2117
07:26:07,460 --> 07:26:11,460
I'm just trying to get to DLC right now.

2118
07:26:11,460 --> 07:26:13,460
What the hell?

2119
07:26:13,460 --> 07:26:19,460
There's a casual golden seed.

2120
07:26:19,460 --> 07:26:24,460
Alright, let's keep going.

2121
07:26:24,460 --> 07:26:26,460
I want to be known before I go to sleep.

2122
07:26:26,460 --> 07:26:29,460
Imagine Muppet should be killing the bosses of the sound clip.

2123
07:26:29,460 --> 07:26:33,460
Miss Picky Karate Choppy Kermit!

2124
07:26:33,460 --> 07:26:37,460
Has been amusing me all stream.

2125
07:26:37,460 --> 07:26:38,460
That is hilarious.

2126
07:26:38,460 --> 07:26:40,460
Thank you, Oregon.

2127
07:26:40,460 --> 07:26:43,460
Have a good sleep.

2128
07:26:43,460 --> 07:26:46,460
Oh my god, that just made me chuckle.

2129
07:26:46,460 --> 07:26:48,460
There's a lot of puppies around here.

2130
07:26:48,460 --> 07:26:49,460
I don't want to anger the puppies.

2131
07:26:49,460 --> 07:26:52,460
I like how this one, the bird, that's not a death bird,

2132
07:26:52,460 --> 07:26:59,460
but the bird just kind of sits there and chills.

2133
07:26:59,460 --> 07:27:02,460
Sneaky?

2134
07:27:02,460 --> 07:27:07,460
Sneaky?

2135
07:27:07,460 --> 07:27:16,460
Sneaky, sneaky, be careful.

2136
07:27:16,460 --> 07:27:18,460
Are they chilling?

2137
07:27:18,460 --> 07:27:28,460
Yeah, I know how terrifying they are.

2138
07:27:28,460 --> 07:27:32,460
Sick.

2139
07:27:32,460 --> 07:27:34,460
I don't have any sacred tears, right?

2140
07:27:34,460 --> 07:27:36,460
I thought I did when it said,

2141
07:27:36,460 --> 07:27:37,460
Oh, you want to use a sacred tear?

2142
07:27:37,460 --> 07:27:57,460
I'm like, oh yeah, sure.

2143
07:27:57,460 --> 07:27:59,460
I need 52 intelligence for that.

2144
07:27:59,460 --> 07:28:01,460
Jesus Christ.

2145
07:28:01,460 --> 07:28:06,460
Alright, well.

2146
07:28:06,460 --> 07:28:13,460
Let's ride and avoid shit.

2147
07:28:13,460 --> 07:28:14,460
Where is it?

2148
07:28:14,460 --> 07:28:15,460
There it is.

2149
07:28:15,460 --> 07:28:19,460
Oh, that already fucking took out Torrent so fast.

2150
07:28:19,460 --> 07:28:25,460
Alright, nevermind.

2151
07:28:25,460 --> 07:28:27,460
I wanted to get away from the fire,

2152
07:28:27,460 --> 07:28:30,460
because I knew I was going to die.

2153
07:28:30,460 --> 07:28:35,460
It's fine.

2154
07:28:35,460 --> 07:28:38,460
I got that.

2155
07:28:38,460 --> 07:28:41,460
I've always been kind of confused by that.

2156
07:28:41,460 --> 07:28:42,460
Why is that?

2157
07:28:42,460 --> 07:28:45,460
Oh, there's a portal here.

2158
07:28:45,460 --> 07:28:56,460
It cannot be used now.

2159
07:28:56,460 --> 07:29:21,460
Damn, fucking Torrent is getting God right now.

2160
07:29:21,460 --> 07:29:22,460
Oh, Torrent, please.

2161
07:29:22,460 --> 07:29:23,460
Oh, come on, Torrent.

2162
07:29:23,460 --> 07:29:24,460
You got this, Torrent.

2163
07:29:24,460 --> 07:29:37,460
Come on, Torrent.

2164
07:29:37,460 --> 07:29:42,460
It's fine.

2165
07:29:42,460 --> 07:29:45,460
Oh, well.

2166
07:29:45,460 --> 07:30:01,460
This will be fun.

2167
07:30:01,460 --> 07:30:09,460
Hey, nice.

2168
07:30:09,460 --> 07:30:10,460
How did the...

2169
07:30:10,460 --> 07:30:14,460
Oh.

2170
07:30:14,460 --> 07:30:15,460
Who's manning this trebuchet?

2171
07:30:15,460 --> 07:30:20,460
I just want to talk.

2172
07:30:20,460 --> 07:30:22,460
I came up all the way here to kill you.

2173
07:30:22,460 --> 07:30:36,460
I thought this is where Red Main Castle was.

2174
07:30:36,460 --> 07:30:37,460
Something near me?

2175
07:30:37,460 --> 07:30:38,460
Oh, fucking bat.

2176
07:30:38,460 --> 07:30:40,460
What's up, bitch?

2177
07:30:40,460 --> 07:30:42,460
Can I launch myself back?

2178
07:30:42,460 --> 07:30:43,460
That'd be funny.

2179
07:30:43,460 --> 07:30:48,460
I want to launch myself.

2180
07:30:48,460 --> 07:30:53,460
Yeah, that'd be nifty.

2181
07:30:53,460 --> 07:31:07,460
No, we both can't attack each other.

2182
07:31:07,460 --> 07:31:23,460
Damn it, I thought I could jump right before, but there's a little thing right there.

2183
07:31:23,460 --> 07:31:25,460
Did you sit at an altar?

2184
07:31:25,460 --> 07:31:31,460
Apparently, Volcano Manor doesn't count.

2185
07:31:31,460 --> 07:31:33,460
How many runes did I lose?

2186
07:31:33,460 --> 07:31:35,460
Can somebody tell me?

2187
07:31:35,460 --> 07:31:43,460
Actually, I can tell myself.

2188
07:31:43,460 --> 07:31:50,460
I am blocking how many runes I have.

2189
07:31:50,460 --> 07:31:51,460
It probably doesn't matter.

2190
07:31:51,460 --> 07:31:52,460
I don't really care that much.

2191
07:31:52,460 --> 07:31:53,460
Yeah, four to five K.

2192
07:31:53,460 --> 07:31:54,460
I don't really care that much.

2193
07:31:54,460 --> 07:32:03,460
It's not a big deal.

2194
07:32:03,460 --> 07:32:11,460
Okay, yeah, that doesn't count.

2195
07:32:11,460 --> 07:32:16,460
Let's go back.

2196
07:32:16,460 --> 07:32:21,460
Try to leave the fucking manor.

2197
07:32:21,460 --> 07:32:30,460
Well, frick!

2198
07:32:30,460 --> 07:32:36,460
Sorry, rubbing my fucking ears, because the headphones itself don't hurt.

2199
07:32:36,460 --> 07:32:41,460
It's just that when I'm wearing my glasses with them, they press a little bit.

2200
07:32:41,460 --> 07:32:46,460
It's like a little headdent.

2201
07:32:46,460 --> 07:32:51,460
I have dents about my fucking ears.

2202
07:32:51,460 --> 07:32:57,460
Now, how the fuck am I supposed to leave this place?

2203
07:32:57,460 --> 07:32:58,460
There's a grace here.

2204
07:32:58,460 --> 07:33:08,460
I can't fucking remember.

2205
07:33:08,460 --> 07:33:17,460
I wish I had Bloodhound Step, because then I would just attach that to a dagger and fucking go wherever.

2206
07:33:17,460 --> 07:33:18,460
That's where it came from?

2207
07:33:18,460 --> 07:33:19,460
No.

2208
07:33:19,460 --> 07:33:20,460
Sure.

2209
07:33:20,460 --> 07:33:22,460
Let's go wherever this leads us.

2210
07:33:22,460 --> 07:33:24,460
There's a lot of stuff here.

2211
07:33:24,460 --> 07:33:26,460
What do the people have to say?

2212
07:33:26,460 --> 07:33:27,460
Detour ahead?

2213
07:33:27,460 --> 07:33:29,460
Are you wearing a hole?

2214
07:33:29,460 --> 07:33:30,460
A vision of a hole?

2215
07:33:30,460 --> 07:33:31,460
Oh.

2216
07:33:31,460 --> 07:33:33,460
I found the hole.

2217
07:33:33,460 --> 07:33:35,460
I found it.

2218
07:33:35,460 --> 07:33:38,460
Didn't expect a hole.

2219
07:33:38,460 --> 07:33:40,460
Grass.

2220
07:33:40,460 --> 07:33:45,460
Alright, he's fighting something.

2221
07:33:45,460 --> 07:33:48,460
Isn't this where...

2222
07:33:48,460 --> 07:33:49,460
Wait a second.

2223
07:33:49,460 --> 07:33:52,460
This looks mighty familiar.

2224
07:33:52,460 --> 07:33:56,460
Isn't this where you fight late?

2225
07:33:56,460 --> 07:33:58,460
A question mark?

2226
07:33:58,460 --> 07:34:05,460
At some point?

2227
07:34:05,460 --> 07:34:07,460
I don't know.

2228
07:34:07,460 --> 07:34:08,460
No?

2229
07:34:08,460 --> 07:34:09,460
No?

2230
07:34:09,460 --> 07:34:12,460
It's a different place?

2231
07:34:12,460 --> 07:34:13,460
It's a no-car...

2232
07:34:13,460 --> 07:34:16,460
Oh yeah, you're right, you're right.

2233
07:34:16,460 --> 07:34:17,460
Oh.

2234
07:34:17,460 --> 07:34:20,460
Who the fuck is here then?

2235
07:34:20,460 --> 07:34:21,460
Oh.

2236
07:34:21,460 --> 07:34:22,460
Let's find out.

2237
07:34:22,460 --> 07:34:27,460
Oh, it's...

2238
07:34:27,460 --> 07:34:36,460
Oh, fucking Jesus Christ.

2239
07:34:36,460 --> 07:34:41,460
This is fun.

2240
07:34:41,460 --> 07:34:42,460
Ow.

2241
07:34:42,460 --> 07:34:43,460
Actually...

2242
07:34:43,460 --> 07:34:50,460
No, I'm going to roll into that.

2243
07:34:50,460 --> 07:34:59,460
No, I don't want you to be grabbing his little hands.

2244
07:34:59,460 --> 07:35:09,460
How am I supposed to...?

2245
07:35:09,460 --> 07:35:28,460
Oh, I was hoping it wouldn't be able to hit me.

2246
07:35:28,460 --> 07:35:30,460
Oh fuck, you're over here now.

2247
07:35:30,460 --> 07:35:35,460
Ain't that nice?

2248
07:35:35,460 --> 07:35:37,460
Am I dead?

2249
07:35:37,460 --> 07:35:44,460
I gotta be dead now.

2250
07:35:44,460 --> 07:35:47,460
Grab my little body.

2251
07:35:47,460 --> 07:35:58,460
There really isn't a whole lot of little snakes.

2252
07:35:58,460 --> 07:36:01,460
I hate that they're called abductor.

2253
07:36:01,460 --> 07:36:04,460
I thought it was going to be called abducator.

2254
07:36:04,460 --> 07:36:06,460
I thought everybody was joking.

2255
07:36:06,460 --> 07:36:08,460
Alright, well...

2256
07:36:08,460 --> 07:36:10,460
You gotta say hello.

2257
07:36:10,460 --> 07:36:13,460
Now I know what to expect.

2258
07:36:13,460 --> 07:36:15,460
Look at this little guy.

2259
07:36:15,460 --> 07:36:16,460
They're so cute.

2260
07:36:16,460 --> 07:36:18,460
Truly.

2261
07:36:18,460 --> 07:36:23,460
Well...

2262
07:36:23,460 --> 07:36:25,460
Since there's a hole there...

2263
07:36:25,460 --> 07:36:27,460
I should probably get a fucking flashlight.

2264
07:36:27,460 --> 07:36:30,460
Can I go around it?

2265
07:36:30,460 --> 07:36:33,460
No?

2266
07:36:33,460 --> 07:36:34,460
Yes?

2267
07:36:34,460 --> 07:36:35,460
No?

2268
07:36:35,460 --> 07:36:36,460
Can I go down there?

2269
07:36:36,460 --> 07:36:38,460
Alright, well...

2270
07:36:38,460 --> 07:36:42,460
If you insist.

2271
07:36:42,460 --> 07:36:44,460
What are they weak to?

2272
07:36:44,460 --> 07:36:46,460
Not that I have anything.

2273
07:36:46,460 --> 07:36:49,460
When you're first doing a playthrough and you grab everything

2274
07:36:49,460 --> 07:36:51,460
and you do fucking every little thing,

2275
07:36:51,460 --> 07:36:57,460
you have so many swords and weapons to play with.

2276
07:36:57,460 --> 07:37:00,460
I'm like, ah, they're weak against this?

2277
07:37:00,460 --> 07:37:04,460
Bet, and then I fucking pull that out.

2278
07:37:04,460 --> 07:37:10,460
Did they fight them all the way over here too?

2279
07:37:10,460 --> 07:37:14,460
I'm confused.

2280
07:37:14,460 --> 07:37:15,460
Duck people.

2281
07:37:15,460 --> 07:37:17,460
The hole is the way out.

2282
07:37:17,460 --> 07:37:20,460
Alright.

2283
07:37:20,460 --> 07:37:22,460
Try lightning.

2284
07:37:22,460 --> 07:37:24,460
I don't have any lightning.

2285
07:37:25,460 --> 07:37:27,460
Cough, cough, cough.

2286
07:37:43,460 --> 07:37:46,460
No, no.

2287
07:37:46,460 --> 07:37:49,460
Let me out.

2288
07:37:54,460 --> 07:38:17,460
I literally dodged that.

2289
07:38:17,460 --> 07:38:19,460
What did I mouth you, girl?

2290
07:38:19,460 --> 07:38:25,460
Merging up doctors?

2291
07:38:25,460 --> 07:38:29,460
They're weak when they open?

2292
07:38:29,460 --> 07:38:31,460
I didn't know they were full of snakes.

2293
07:38:31,460 --> 07:38:47,460
They're just a lot of little grabby hands.

2294
07:38:47,460 --> 07:38:56,460
Let's see how they do with the regular magic.

2295
07:38:56,460 --> 07:39:00,460
I know someone said grass, but they're like lily pads.

2296
07:39:00,460 --> 07:39:13,460
Surprise! It's snakes!

2297
07:39:13,460 --> 07:39:20,460
What?

2298
07:39:20,460 --> 07:39:23,460
I wish there was friendly fire on these fucking bitches.

2299
07:39:23,460 --> 07:39:26,460
That would be great.

2300
07:39:26,460 --> 07:39:27,460
No!

2301
07:39:27,460 --> 07:39:29,460
Don't do it, you fucking whore.

2302
07:39:29,460 --> 07:39:35,460
I swear to God.

2303
07:39:35,460 --> 07:39:41,460
No!

2304
07:39:41,460 --> 07:39:51,460
No!

2305
07:39:51,460 --> 07:39:55,460
I'm tired of this, Grandpa.

2306
07:39:55,460 --> 07:40:09,460
What I usually do is I usually get them trapped.

2307
07:40:09,460 --> 07:40:15,460
How did you get up there, bro?

2308
07:40:15,460 --> 07:40:17,460
How did you get up there?

2309
07:40:17,460 --> 07:40:19,460
Oh, perfect.

2310
07:40:19,460 --> 07:40:28,460
Well, never mind.

2311
07:40:28,460 --> 07:40:30,460
Come on!

2312
07:40:30,460 --> 07:40:34,460
Even if I got up there, how are they able to hurt me?

2313
07:40:34,460 --> 07:40:37,460
I didn't know I could throw it upwards.

2314
07:40:37,460 --> 07:40:39,460
Muppet? Yeah, one of it.

2315
07:40:39,460 --> 07:40:41,460
You're a muppet.

2316
07:40:41,460 --> 07:40:53,460
Boy, you built like a muppet.

2317
07:40:53,460 --> 07:40:58,460
Excuse me, sir.

2318
07:40:58,460 --> 07:41:05,460
Boy, you built like a baked bean! A baked bean!

2319
07:41:05,460 --> 07:41:08,460
This is annoying.

2320
07:41:08,460 --> 07:41:11,460
If there was one of them, that would have been fine.

2321
07:41:11,460 --> 07:41:21,460
But the twins makes it a little bit more tricky.

2322
07:41:21,460 --> 07:41:26,460
Stop it!

2323
07:41:26,460 --> 07:41:29,460
And then it becomes fucking impervious.

2324
07:41:29,460 --> 07:41:43,460
And so it's a waste of my fucking stuff.

2325
07:41:43,460 --> 07:41:48,460
Can I see?

2326
07:41:48,460 --> 07:41:50,460
See, it can grab me from here.

2327
07:41:50,460 --> 07:41:52,460
Oh God.

2328
07:41:53,460 --> 07:41:58,460
Jesus.

2329
07:41:58,460 --> 07:42:06,460
This is great.

2330
07:42:06,460 --> 07:42:08,460
Can I have a moment?

2331
07:42:08,460 --> 07:42:32,460
Oh God.

2332
07:42:32,460 --> 07:42:34,460
Oh God.

2333
07:42:34,460 --> 07:42:36,460
What the fuck, bitch?

2334
07:42:36,460 --> 07:42:45,460
Oh, what the fuck, bitch?

2335
07:42:45,460 --> 07:42:54,460
No. No.

2336
07:42:54,460 --> 07:43:08,460
No.

2337
07:43:08,460 --> 07:43:15,460
It looks like I can't get out of here.

2338
07:43:15,460 --> 07:43:17,460
Why are you talking like that?

2339
07:43:17,460 --> 07:43:20,460
Is your E button broken?

2340
07:43:21,460 --> 07:43:35,460
Again, with the homestuck speech.

2341
07:43:35,460 --> 07:43:43,460
You're giving me a stroke.

2342
07:43:43,460 --> 07:43:48,460
Sadly, yes.

2343
07:43:48,460 --> 07:43:58,460
Why don't you just pop the key off and try to fix that?

2344
07:43:58,460 --> 07:44:00,460
I'll buy you.

2345
07:44:00,460 --> 07:44:03,460
I'm back in 2005 and I hate it.

2346
07:44:03,460 --> 07:44:13,460
I know, I feel like I'm reading MySpace.

2347
07:44:13,460 --> 07:44:14,460
Should I?

2348
07:44:14,460 --> 07:44:26,460
They probably won't do shit with the lead.

2349
07:44:26,460 --> 07:44:28,460
Alright, fuck it.

2350
07:44:28,460 --> 07:44:56,460
Oh.

2351
07:44:56,460 --> 07:45:00,460
I was actually working, so I will continue to do that.

2352
07:45:00,460 --> 07:45:02,460
I'll focus on one.

2353
07:45:02,460 --> 07:45:11,460
It's just hard to keep an eye on the other one.

2354
07:45:11,460 --> 07:45:13,460
Yeah, I don't know why you just don't copy-paste ease.

2355
07:45:13,460 --> 07:45:15,460
That's a good point as well.

2356
07:45:15,460 --> 07:45:18,460
Well, that is annoying in like the middle of a sentence.

2357
07:45:18,460 --> 07:45:25,460
I'll be here or something.

2358
07:45:25,460 --> 07:45:27,460
Okay.

2359
07:45:27,460 --> 07:45:30,460
Alright, it doesn't matter.

2360
07:45:30,460 --> 07:45:36,460
A little fire never hurt nobody.

2361
07:45:36,460 --> 07:45:39,460
Visions of hole.

2362
07:45:39,460 --> 07:45:42,460
Chapped humps together to give him an E.

2363
07:45:42,460 --> 07:45:49,460
That's funny.

2364
07:45:49,460 --> 07:45:51,460
I can't even read that.

2365
07:45:51,460 --> 07:45:53,460
What?

2366
07:45:53,460 --> 07:45:55,460
Alright, let's focus on one.

2367
07:45:55,460 --> 07:46:24,460
I'm gonna focus on this one.

2368
07:46:24,460 --> 07:46:30,460
I was drinking!

2369
07:46:30,460 --> 07:46:32,460
This will take a while.

2370
07:46:32,460 --> 07:46:34,460
This will take a while.

2371
07:46:34,460 --> 07:46:44,460
I apologize in advance.

2372
07:46:44,460 --> 07:46:49,460
I just hate it when I have to walk places and do the same fucking thing over and over again.

2373
07:46:49,460 --> 07:46:51,460
Just drop me in front of the thing.

2374
07:46:51,460 --> 07:47:01,460
That's all I ask.

2375
07:47:01,460 --> 07:47:19,460
Are you drinking during a fight?

2376
07:47:19,460 --> 07:47:28,460
Kinda fucked myself as well.

2377
07:47:28,460 --> 07:47:30,460
That's a good point.

2378
07:47:30,460 --> 07:47:47,460
Let me try to see if the jellyfish will take off aggro, but I highly doubt it.

2379
07:47:47,460 --> 07:47:49,460
I'm wondering which one.

2380
07:47:49,460 --> 07:47:54,460
I have the skeleton militiaman ashes.

2381
07:47:54,460 --> 07:47:59,460
I have the jellyfish.

2382
07:47:59,460 --> 07:48:06,460
And then I have the wolves.

2383
07:48:06,460 --> 07:48:08,460
I'm asking the triggers.

2384
07:48:08,460 --> 07:48:20,460
I should grab early.

2385
07:48:20,460 --> 07:48:35,460
It's funny because I instinctively want to do that as if I'm gonna wiggle out.

2386
07:48:35,460 --> 07:48:42,460
Should I grab the jellyfish?

2387
07:48:42,460 --> 07:48:46,460
Oh, master triggers!

2388
07:48:46,460 --> 07:48:48,460
Do it!

2389
07:48:48,460 --> 07:48:50,460
Oh, it kinda worked.

2390
07:48:50,460 --> 07:49:02,460
No, do it again.

2391
07:49:02,460 --> 07:49:04,460
Guys, I don't think this is working.

2392
07:49:04,460 --> 07:49:10,460
Guys, I think I have blood loss.

2393
07:49:10,460 --> 07:49:15,460
I'm starting to forget regular sheevee and getting used to muffin sheevee help.

2394
07:49:15,460 --> 07:49:21,460
It's kinda weird because I just have a weird American flag next to me.

2395
07:49:21,460 --> 07:49:27,460
Luckily, I'm here to talk to you about how you can support our soldiers.

2396
07:49:27,460 --> 07:49:32,460
With my hand up, I'm like, well.

2397
07:49:32,460 --> 07:49:36,460
With war with blah blah blah on the rise.

2398
07:49:36,460 --> 07:49:40,460
It's time to support our soldiers, men.

2399
07:49:40,460 --> 07:49:42,460
You say women should be back in the kitchen?

2400
07:49:42,460 --> 07:49:46,460
You should be enlisting.

2401
07:49:46,460 --> 07:49:48,460
Hello, welcome to...

2402
07:49:48,460 --> 07:49:51,460
Welcome to being a member.

2403
07:49:51,460 --> 07:49:55,460
Delanash!

2404
07:49:55,460 --> 07:49:56,460
Ronnie time?

2405
07:49:56,460 --> 07:50:01,460
What do you mean, Ronnie time?

2406
07:50:03,460 --> 07:50:05,460
Oh, god.

2407
07:50:05,460 --> 07:50:23,460
Can you guys hit each other? That'd be great.

2408
07:50:23,460 --> 07:50:25,460
Oh, hello.

2409
07:50:25,460 --> 07:50:27,460
Hello, nice to see you there.

2410
07:50:56,460 --> 07:51:02,460
Fuck off, bro.

2411
07:51:09,460 --> 07:51:11,460
No.

2412
07:51:14,460 --> 07:51:16,460
I'm dead.

2413
07:51:25,460 --> 07:51:30,460
Close, close.

2414
07:51:30,460 --> 07:51:33,460
Yeah, I need to kill at least one of them and I'll be golden.

2415
07:51:33,460 --> 07:51:39,460
All I have to do is run away from the other one.

2416
07:51:39,460 --> 07:51:49,460
Okay, the sickle one is better to get up and close personal to, in my opinion.

2417
07:51:49,460 --> 07:52:01,460
You...

2418
07:52:01,460 --> 07:52:15,460
Are these the main bosses of volcano manor? I can't remember.

2419
07:52:15,460 --> 07:52:23,460
Oh, this has been fun.

2420
07:52:23,460 --> 07:52:25,460
Like I just flop on the ground.

2421
07:52:25,460 --> 07:52:27,460
No!

2422
07:52:27,460 --> 07:52:33,460
You fucking asshole, he's like, my turn.

2423
07:52:33,460 --> 07:52:35,460
Come here, you.

2424
07:52:35,460 --> 07:52:37,460
You're mine.

2425
07:52:37,460 --> 07:52:43,460
Ha!

2426
07:52:43,460 --> 07:52:48,460
I don't quite understand that.

2427
07:52:48,460 --> 07:52:57,460
No!

2428
07:52:57,460 --> 07:53:01,460
I'm just getting passed around.

2429
07:53:01,460 --> 07:53:05,460
Like I'm at a fucking frat party, what the fuck is this?

2430
07:53:05,460 --> 07:53:11,460
This is stupid.

2431
07:53:11,460 --> 07:53:17,460
I'm mad, but I still got jokes.

2432
07:53:27,460 --> 07:53:29,460
What frat party was this?

2433
07:53:29,460 --> 07:53:31,460
I've never been to a frat party.

2434
07:53:31,460 --> 07:53:37,460
This is just a joke.

2435
07:53:37,460 --> 07:53:43,460
I never went to a actual college, I just did online college.

2436
07:53:43,460 --> 07:53:45,460
Because it's so easy.

2437
07:53:45,460 --> 07:53:57,460
I was working on getting my computer science degree.

2438
07:53:57,460 --> 07:54:03,460
I am stuck.

2439
07:54:03,460 --> 07:54:14,460
No.

2440
07:54:14,460 --> 07:54:32,460
I'm scared of being caught.

2441
07:54:32,460 --> 07:54:42,460
Do you see how he tracks me?

2442
07:54:42,460 --> 07:54:46,460
I need to heal.

2443
07:54:46,460 --> 07:54:48,460
I need to heal again.

2444
07:54:48,460 --> 07:54:53,460
I need to fuck.

2445
07:54:53,460 --> 07:55:01,460
No, I never finished school.

2446
07:55:01,460 --> 07:55:03,460
It's just a pain.

2447
07:55:03,460 --> 07:55:05,460
I didn't like it.

2448
07:55:05,460 --> 07:55:07,460
I didn't like school.

2449
07:55:07,460 --> 07:55:12,460
If anything, I'm considering going back.

2450
07:55:12,460 --> 07:55:16,460
I didn't mean to press that, but it's fine.

2451
07:55:16,460 --> 07:55:22,460
And if anything, making my major psychology or something.

2452
07:55:22,460 --> 07:55:25,460
Or just a liberal art.

2453
07:55:25,460 --> 07:55:33,460
Just because, although, like, I would have made really good money had I stuck with it.

2454
07:55:33,460 --> 07:55:36,460
But I'm like, I enjoyed coding.

2455
07:55:36,460 --> 07:55:40,460
I wanted to be, I wanted to be do front end development.

2456
07:55:40,460 --> 07:55:50,460
Because I really love just making things pretty.

2457
07:55:50,460 --> 07:55:58,460
Now.

2458
07:55:58,460 --> 07:56:04,460
Can I get out of here?

2459
07:56:04,460 --> 07:56:08,460
If I had lightning, this would be great.

2460
07:56:08,460 --> 07:56:11,460
Yeah, happy pork.

2461
07:56:11,460 --> 07:56:13,460
Is the ash of war too much to them?

2462
07:56:13,460 --> 07:56:14,460
I'll try it.

2463
07:56:14,460 --> 07:56:17,460
I didn't try it yet.

2464
07:56:17,460 --> 07:56:25,460
I don't think they're kind of like doesn't really matter with like with magic.

2465
07:56:25,460 --> 07:56:26,460
I tried throwing rocks at them.

2466
07:56:26,460 --> 07:56:36,460
I didn't really do anything.

2467
07:56:36,460 --> 07:56:45,460
I know I never, ever use lightning unless it's against these motherfuckers.

2468
07:56:45,460 --> 07:56:48,460
For everyone, my career for it is mostly high school grads that just buy a school.

2469
07:56:48,460 --> 07:56:49,460
Yeah.

2470
07:56:49,460 --> 07:56:57,460
I just like, because I was in school before I got into the dealer.

2471
07:56:57,460 --> 07:57:02,460
But I was just like, I didn't get out of school because of dealer.

2472
07:57:02,460 --> 07:57:03,460
Don't don't get it twisted.

2473
07:57:03,460 --> 07:57:09,460
It was just that I was already a thing on my mind.

2474
07:57:09,460 --> 07:57:14,460
Oh my fucking God, bro.

2475
07:57:14,460 --> 07:57:15,460
Please.

2476
07:57:15,460 --> 07:57:16,460
Please.

2477
07:57:16,460 --> 07:57:18,460
A camera lock dude.

2478
07:57:18,460 --> 07:57:22,460
I need to not lock my camera.

2479
07:57:22,460 --> 07:57:31,460
But I was already planning on leaving and then kind of, because I had already taken a break for like two months of school.

2480
07:57:31,460 --> 07:57:32,460
And then I was just like, you know what?

2481
07:57:32,460 --> 07:57:34,460
I don't care anymore.

2482
07:57:34,460 --> 07:57:41,460
I have plenty of time to go to school anytime I fucking want.

2483
07:57:41,460 --> 07:57:52,460
I was thinking, like let's say like a bazillion years from now when the dealer isn't around.

2484
07:57:52,460 --> 07:58:06,460
I was thinking, because you know how like, you know how like psychology is very, very important.

2485
07:58:06,460 --> 07:58:15,460
There is no true fucking HR in a Corpo.

2486
07:58:15,460 --> 07:58:16,460
Mental health's important.

2487
07:58:16,460 --> 07:58:30,460
I was wondering if I could market myself as a psychologist for VTubers.

2488
07:58:30,460 --> 07:58:39,460
And be, oh my God, I'm going to die.

2489
07:58:39,460 --> 07:58:43,460
And be like a manager, a psychologist sort of thing.

2490
07:58:43,460 --> 07:58:55,460
I feel like that would be a very sought after thing in the industry.

2491
07:58:55,460 --> 07:58:57,460
What the heck did you back up?

2492
07:58:57,460 --> 07:59:00,460
Whoa.

2493
07:59:00,460 --> 07:59:04,460
Open your little mouth.

2494
07:59:04,460 --> 07:59:12,460
Let me jump out.

2495
07:59:12,460 --> 07:59:17,460
Oh God, hello.

2496
07:59:17,460 --> 07:59:20,460
Oh God, how are you knowing where I'm jumping?

2497
07:59:20,460 --> 07:59:35,460
Oh God, I was hoping you would get stuck behind them so you didn't roll me down.

2498
07:59:35,460 --> 07:59:39,460
Because I'm very in tune with people's emotions.

2499
07:59:39,460 --> 07:59:41,460
And I love, love, love, love psychology.

2500
07:59:41,460 --> 07:59:59,460
And just really finding out like the how's and why's, like why our brain makes specific decisions and kind of how to work things out in a healthy way.

2501
07:59:59,460 --> 08:00:09,460
And because I do have a management background at my last job, I feel like,

2502
08:00:09,460 --> 08:00:17,460
like let's say, let's say like three years from now or whatever,

2503
08:00:17,460 --> 08:00:20,460
Strawny anticipates us to stop having gents.

2504
08:00:20,460 --> 08:00:26,460
Maybe the fourth year I decide to be, I comment on as a talent manager instead of a talent, you know?

2505
08:00:26,460 --> 08:00:27,460
I think that'd be cool.

2506
08:00:27,460 --> 08:00:29,460
Because I'm trying to think of long term.

2507
08:00:29,460 --> 08:00:37,460
You can't be a VTuber forever, sadly, I wish I could.

2508
08:00:37,460 --> 08:00:41,460
And I think that would be pretty violent because there always will be VTubers.

2509
08:00:41,460 --> 08:00:45,460
Like I don't, that won't go away.

2510
08:00:45,460 --> 08:00:47,460
But I think it would be cool.

2511
08:00:47,460 --> 08:00:51,460
Oh my God, please.

2512
08:00:51,460 --> 08:00:53,460
Just give me a chance.

2513
08:00:53,460 --> 08:01:00,460
Just give me a chance.

2514
08:01:00,460 --> 08:01:03,460
But it's like I do have this approach ability.

2515
08:01:03,460 --> 08:01:05,460
I do have this, like I can be professional.

2516
08:01:05,460 --> 08:01:08,460
I want to be.

2517
08:01:08,460 --> 08:01:16,460
I am good in terms of like, I'm good with networking.

2518
08:01:16,460 --> 08:01:18,460
I'm good at connecting with people.

2519
08:01:18,460 --> 08:01:24,460
And I feel like I would benefit a lot of like future YouTubers in no way.

2520
08:01:24,460 --> 08:01:26,460
And especially because I've been part of the industry.

2521
08:01:26,460 --> 08:01:32,460
Again, this is years and years and years and years into the future.

2522
08:01:32,460 --> 08:01:35,460
Because again, I want to make VTuber my full time job right now.

2523
08:01:35,460 --> 08:01:38,460
It's essentially is.

2524
08:01:38,460 --> 08:01:47,460
And so I think it would be pretty cool to do something like that in the future.

2525
08:01:47,460 --> 08:01:54,460
Like to, or like be some sort of social media management, which I never really anticipated for myself before.

2526
08:01:54,460 --> 08:01:59,460
Maybe I'll take a like communications course or something.

2527
08:01:59,460 --> 08:02:02,460
Unironically, you'd be a great mental health professional.

2528
08:02:02,460 --> 08:02:09,460
I don't know why, but hearing that is just really funny.

2529
08:02:09,460 --> 08:02:11,460
I don't know why it's just funny to me.

2530
08:02:11,460 --> 08:02:20,460
Unironically, VTuber, that looks like a Muppet right now, you'd be a really great mental health professional.

2531
08:02:20,460 --> 08:02:21,460
Yeah, exactly.

2532
08:02:21,460 --> 08:02:25,460
So that's why I'm like, okay, after the three gents, because I want to be there.

2533
08:02:25,460 --> 08:02:26,460
I want to be there to help stick out.

2534
08:02:26,460 --> 08:02:29,460
Maybe the third gen, I help mentor.

2535
08:02:29,460 --> 08:02:30,460
I love being a mentor.

2536
08:02:30,460 --> 08:02:31,460
I love teaching.

2537
08:02:31,460 --> 08:02:37,460
I love that sort of stuff.

2538
08:02:37,460 --> 08:02:39,460
Oh, hello.

2539
08:02:39,460 --> 08:02:43,460
Hi.

2540
08:02:43,460 --> 08:02:45,460
Why do you get to clip through each other?

2541
08:02:45,460 --> 08:02:49,460
That's not fair.

2542
08:02:50,460 --> 08:02:51,460
How did you kill me?

2543
08:02:51,460 --> 08:02:55,460
Oh, I thought I was, I never got them in your hitbox.

2544
08:02:55,460 --> 08:02:57,460
You can see the little sneaky poos.

2545
08:02:57,460 --> 08:02:58,460
There.

2546
08:02:58,460 --> 08:03:03,460
Oh, right, it's a little air box.

2547
08:03:03,460 --> 08:03:05,460
A lot of conversations with my sex Muppet.

2548
08:03:05,460 --> 08:03:07,460
It really helped me.

2549
08:03:07,460 --> 08:03:13,460
My psychologist brought up how after I confided them that I wasn't comfy talking to a person, I would honestly be the most helping thing.

2550
08:03:13,460 --> 08:03:14,460
Oh, really?

2551
08:03:14,460 --> 08:03:15,460
You think so?

2552
08:03:15,460 --> 08:03:17,460
That's cute.

2553
08:03:17,460 --> 08:03:23,460
Like, I'm very in touch with my mental health.

2554
08:03:23,460 --> 08:03:27,460
I mean, just dropping a dookie behind me.

2555
08:03:27,460 --> 08:03:28,460
Oh, fuck.

2556
08:03:28,460 --> 08:03:29,460
Oh, fuck.

2557
08:03:29,460 --> 08:03:34,460
I can't get out, guys.

2558
08:03:34,460 --> 08:03:38,460
I'm really in touch with my mental health.

2559
08:03:38,460 --> 08:03:40,460
I see it therapist.

2560
08:03:40,460 --> 08:03:42,460
I think mental health is very important.

2561
08:03:42,460 --> 08:03:46,460
Even if you don't really think you need one, it's always good just to have somebody like every once in a while.

2562
08:03:46,460 --> 08:03:49,460
Like every few months or so.

2563
08:03:49,460 --> 08:03:52,460
In fact, I need to message my therapist back.

2564
08:03:52,460 --> 08:03:56,460
She just came back from vacation.

2565
08:03:56,460 --> 08:04:03,460
It's important to like have somebody bounce off of this like kind of an unbiased third party.

2566
08:04:03,460 --> 08:04:09,460
Kind of help you untangle the yarn that is your mind, you know?

2567
08:04:09,460 --> 08:04:15,460
Coming for you, bro.

2568
08:04:16,460 --> 08:04:19,460
I wish I could get you stuck on something.

2569
08:04:19,460 --> 08:04:20,460
I'm dead already.

2570
08:04:20,460 --> 08:04:22,460
Guys, I don't know.

2571
08:04:22,460 --> 08:04:23,460
This is so annoying.

2572
08:04:23,460 --> 08:04:31,460
This might be a beat-off stream thing again.

2573
08:04:31,460 --> 08:04:32,460
Yeah, outside perspective.

2574
08:04:32,460 --> 08:04:42,460
I've also worked with psychologists and practitioners.

2575
08:04:42,460 --> 08:04:48,460
I just find mental health to be super, super necessary.

2576
08:04:48,460 --> 08:04:59,460
Especially there's not a lot of people that have a focus on mental health that is in regards to people who are social media influencers.

2577
08:04:59,460 --> 08:05:01,460
It's a whole different ballgame.

2578
08:05:01,460 --> 08:05:03,460
You're in the spotlight.

2579
08:05:03,460 --> 08:05:11,460
You are dealing with a different sort of hatred, different sort of comments, different sort of pressure.

2580
08:05:12,460 --> 08:05:19,460
And like you can ask the other girls, I help them work through their shit all the time.

2581
08:05:19,460 --> 08:05:24,460
Not that they have a lot, but just like if they're having a tough time, they talk to me, you know?

2582
08:05:24,460 --> 08:05:31,460
And I can either listen or give you a solution, whatever you want.

2583
08:05:31,460 --> 08:05:33,460
Yeah.

2584
08:05:33,460 --> 08:05:36,460
The only person who can put me down is myself.

2585
08:05:36,460 --> 08:05:40,460
Therapy stream answering mental health related marrows would be really cool actually.

2586
08:05:40,460 --> 08:05:47,460
If I would do that, just because that's a slippery slope, because I'm not a licensed professional.

2587
08:05:47,460 --> 08:05:52,460
I don't want you and people, some of you know would know to take my shit with a grain of salt.

2588
08:05:52,460 --> 08:06:07,460
Others would take it literally and just take my word as Bible, which I don't want.

2589
08:06:07,460 --> 08:06:11,460
That would just be a suggestion. I'm already going to die.

2590
08:06:11,460 --> 08:06:15,460
Can you guys stop? I need you to fuck off.

2591
08:06:15,460 --> 08:06:24,460
Both of you, fuck off. Both of you right now, fuck off.

2592
08:06:24,460 --> 08:06:28,460
You know, no one got me, no psychology major, she got me.

2593
08:06:28,460 --> 08:06:33,460
Um, because I've been a fair, I don't understand how people can do therapy,

2594
08:06:33,460 --> 08:06:38,460
personal health stuff to a stranger seems very daunting, because I've had a fair share of issues.

2595
08:06:38,460 --> 08:06:42,460
I talk with friends and they keep claiming I'm being taken advantage of.

2596
08:06:42,460 --> 08:06:47,460
Oh, because I've had a fair share of issues, like what do you mean?

2597
08:06:47,460 --> 08:06:53,460
Oh wait, this is two different things.

2598
08:06:53,460 --> 08:06:57,460
Therapy, so like I've been in therapy for a very long time.

2599
08:06:57,460 --> 08:07:03,460
I will not lie to you and say, you know, there's a lot of mental health issues running my family,

2600
08:07:03,460 --> 08:07:09,460
but thankfully my parents were, my parents were, oh shit, I'm just going to die.

2601
08:07:09,460 --> 08:07:13,460
Just kill me, just kill me now.

2602
08:07:13,460 --> 08:07:17,460
My parents were very self aware people and they were very open minded.

2603
08:07:17,460 --> 08:07:25,460
Like my parents are not from a generation where they think that mental health is just like get over yourself.

2604
08:07:25,460 --> 08:07:31,460
Which sometimes, you know, sometimes people do need to get over themselves, I won't lie to you.

2605
08:07:31,460 --> 08:07:39,460
So, and I've been to multiple therapists when I was a kid.

2606
08:07:39,460 --> 08:07:44,460
So, because I mentioned to you guys, I have OCD, I also have something called Dermatillomania,

2607
08:07:44,460 --> 08:07:51,460
which is kind of like almost like an offshoot of OCD, where I have this compulsion to pick at my skin,

2608
08:07:51,460 --> 08:07:55,460
because I feel like it's just like, it's a sensory issue for me.

2609
08:07:55,460 --> 08:07:58,460
I don't like when there's a bump, I don't like when there's a scab.

2610
08:07:58,460 --> 08:08:01,460
That's why I relate a lot to Amy when she's like, I love picking my scabs.

2611
08:08:01,460 --> 08:08:04,460
I'm like, oh my god, me too.

2612
08:08:04,460 --> 08:08:08,460
And so I went for that because my parents thought it was a form of self harm.

2613
08:08:08,460 --> 08:08:12,460
It is not, it is literally just almost like an OCD thing.

2614
08:08:13,460 --> 08:08:24,460
Thank you for the tip. Yeah, I'll fix your whole entire life.

2615
08:08:24,460 --> 08:08:30,460
And it took a lot. I remember my first therapist, I didn't say anything to her at all.

2616
08:08:30,460 --> 08:08:34,460
I was like, fuck you, you fucking bitch. I was like 14.

2617
08:08:34,460 --> 08:08:37,460
I'm like, don't talk to me. You don't know anything about me.

2618
08:08:37,460 --> 08:08:42,460
Again, I had lots of bad social anxiety as well.

2619
08:08:55,460 --> 08:08:58,460
I'm stuck. I'm gonna die.

2620
08:09:07,460 --> 08:09:25,460
I should have healed and it takes a lot of trust.

2621
08:09:25,460 --> 08:09:27,460
It takes a lot of repetition.

2622
08:09:27,460 --> 08:09:34,460
It takes, you also have to be in the right mindset to do therapy because you're not.

2623
08:09:34,460 --> 08:09:40,460
The thing looks so fucking funny. It's a little worm.

2624
08:09:40,460 --> 08:09:44,460
It's if you're resistant, it's not going to work out for you.

2625
08:09:44,460 --> 08:09:47,460
Just like, you know, hypnosis or whatever.

2626
08:09:47,460 --> 08:09:50,460
And also the therapist has to be good.

2627
08:09:50,460 --> 08:09:56,460
Like if you go to a therapist and they're like, and how does that make you feel like all fucking stereotypically, don't talk to them.

2628
08:09:56,460 --> 08:09:58,460
They're fucking stupid.

2629
08:09:58,460 --> 08:10:03,460
You want somebody who's going to make you think and going to challenge you and your thought processes.

2630
08:10:03,460 --> 08:10:06,460
And I give a shout out to my therapist for that.

2631
08:10:06,460 --> 08:10:12,460
She fucking bought my merch, I believe, which is hilarious because she was so proud of me because I was telling her.

2632
08:10:12,460 --> 08:10:17,460
She's, again, known me for years, told her how much I wanted to be a VTuber.

2633
08:10:17,460 --> 08:10:20,460
And then it happened and she was so proud.

2634
08:10:20,460 --> 08:10:24,460
She got a little key chain.

2635
08:10:24,460 --> 08:10:31,460
And if I'm feeling a certain type of way, if I'm like, oh, I interacted with this person

2636
08:10:31,460 --> 08:10:36,460
and it was not a good interaction, she's just like, why was it a bad interaction?

2637
08:10:36,460 --> 08:10:39,460
Why, why did you react?

2638
08:10:39,460 --> 08:10:42,460
Why do you think you reacted the way you did?

2639
08:10:42,460 --> 08:10:49,460
What may have caused you like it's just more deeper questions and like, how did that make you feel?

2640
08:10:49,460 --> 08:10:58,460
Because and then I also like people be like, oh, if you go to a therapist, you know, eventually have to stop because then it's then they're just taking advantage of you.

2641
08:10:58,460 --> 08:11:01,460
It's not working anymore.

2642
08:11:01,460 --> 08:11:02,460
Again, it's personal preference.

2643
08:11:02,460 --> 08:11:04,460
You don't have to see one.

2644
08:11:04,460 --> 08:11:11,460
If you don't think talking will help you that it probably won't because talk therapy is a form of therapy.

2645
08:11:11,460 --> 08:11:20,460
It's like there's so many other forms of therapy out there besides just talk therapy.

2646
08:11:20,460 --> 08:11:21,460
It's helpful.

2647
08:11:21,460 --> 08:11:25,460
It's helpful to kind of figure out who you are.

2648
08:11:25,460 --> 08:11:27,460
Again, from an unbiased perspective.

2649
08:11:27,460 --> 08:11:35,460
Then again, there are some very toxic therapists out there who have maybe gotten into it for your own gain.

2650
08:11:35,460 --> 08:11:39,460
That's why it's important to shop around.

2651
08:11:39,460 --> 08:11:49,460
I would say for for one because the first one I remember I went to she was just absolutely fucking off.

2652
08:11:49,460 --> 08:11:56,460
It was monotonous that type of like, how does that make you feel?

2653
08:11:56,460 --> 08:12:00,460
And she didn't take me seriously.

2654
08:12:00,460 --> 08:12:02,460
And I told my parents like, I don't think I don't like this lady.

2655
08:12:02,460 --> 08:12:04,460
And then I went to another one.

2656
08:12:04,460 --> 08:12:10,460
And then she kind of just felt like I felt sorry, smack my microphone accident.

2657
08:12:10,460 --> 08:12:15,460
I felt like she was being really condescending.

2658
08:12:15,460 --> 08:12:20,460
And again, I'm like 14 and I am aware that someone's patronizing me.

2659
08:12:20,460 --> 08:12:23,460
You know, it's bad because usually when you're a kid, you're like, oh, they're supposed to be talking to me like this.

2660
08:12:23,460 --> 08:12:26,460
But no, it was just like, I didn't feel good.

2661
08:12:26,460 --> 08:12:37,460
And I felt like I wasn't getting anywhere because like I was still I was still picking my skin pretty bad.

2662
08:12:37,460 --> 08:12:40,460
My mom was actually like, I had a dermatologist.

2663
08:12:40,460 --> 08:12:42,460
No, no, I had a fucking esthetician.

2664
08:12:42,460 --> 08:12:47,460
It's someone who like does like your skincare and stuff like this when you go to a spa.

2665
08:12:47,460 --> 08:12:49,460
Oh, that's like the simplest way I can put it.

2666
08:12:49,460 --> 08:12:51,460
Hi, Rena.

2667
08:12:51,460 --> 08:13:02,460
And my esthetician was giving me more information about mental stuff and dermatolomania than my own that my own therapist was, which was so funny to me.

2668
08:13:02,460 --> 08:13:04,460
She's like, oh, I've seen this before.

2669
08:13:04,460 --> 08:13:06,460
It's very common in women.

2670
08:13:06,460 --> 08:13:07,460
I'm like, what?

2671
08:13:07,460 --> 08:13:08,460
She's like, yeah.

2672
08:13:08,460 --> 08:13:14,460
You know, the best thing to do is to work on your skincare rather than and then the mental health second.

2673
08:13:14,460 --> 08:13:24,460
Because if you can prevent the stuff from popping up and protect your skin from like accidentally getting hurt or vice versa, then you can almost fight the urge or you can wear gloves.

2674
08:13:24,460 --> 08:13:28,460
And I was like, this lady was pouring so so much fucking information on me.

2675
08:13:28,460 --> 08:13:31,460
And I was like, damn, whereas my therapist was just absolutely useless.

2676
08:13:31,460 --> 08:13:33,460
And now I have a new one.

2677
08:13:34,460 --> 08:13:35,460
Rena, what are you doing?

2678
08:13:35,460 --> 08:13:38,460
She's like, she's sitting on me funny.

2679
08:13:38,460 --> 08:13:39,460
Hi, Rena.

2680
08:13:42,460 --> 08:13:44,460
But yeah, do you want to ask for you?

2681
08:13:44,460 --> 08:13:46,460
You don't have to do it, obviously.

2682
08:13:46,460 --> 08:13:52,460
I went to a therapist and I kept asking questions about my daily schedule instead of the issues I faced in my life and kids for three sessions.

2683
08:13:52,460 --> 08:13:54,460
And I felt like that wasn't the best way to therapy.

2684
08:13:54,460 --> 08:13:56,460
And then you had to tell him that.

2685
08:13:56,460 --> 08:13:58,460
You got to tell him that.

2686
08:13:59,460 --> 08:14:02,460
It's literally you have to be honest.

2687
08:14:02,460 --> 08:14:05,460
It's hard, but you have to be if you're going to get anywhere.

2688
08:14:07,460 --> 08:14:12,460
Parsing your emotions into comprehensible words or thoughts seems to be quite a large part of their.

2689
08:14:12,460 --> 08:14:13,460
Yes, exactly.

2690
08:14:13,460 --> 08:14:15,460
Because like, I remember.

2691
08:14:19,460 --> 08:14:22,460
So like, I've told you guys, I have a lot of religious trauma.

2692
08:14:22,460 --> 08:14:25,460
Ever been a really religious household.

2693
08:14:26,460 --> 08:14:35,460
And I was, as you guys know, I'm kind of drawn to more esoteric things because they just feel better for me.

2694
08:14:35,460 --> 08:14:40,460
And I kind of delved into that with my therapist.

2695
08:14:40,460 --> 08:14:46,460
And she's like, I think you're doing this and you're doing this sort of stuff because you weren't allowed to before.

2696
08:14:46,460 --> 08:14:49,460
And you're feeling rebellious because you weren't allowed to rebel when you're younger.

2697
08:14:49,460 --> 08:14:51,460
And I'm like, holy shit, you're right.

2698
08:14:51,460 --> 08:14:54,460
That's the only reason I was drawn to it.

2699
08:14:54,460 --> 08:14:56,460
It's because it was forbidden.

2700
08:14:56,460 --> 08:15:03,460
Sort of like esoteric, pagan, sort of like tarot card read in shit.

2701
08:15:03,460 --> 08:15:06,460
Because it's like, you know, growing up like it's demonic.

2702
08:15:06,460 --> 08:15:09,460
And I'm like, it was an active rebellion of me participating in it.

2703
08:15:09,460 --> 08:15:12,460
And that's why that's that's literally why I do it.

2704
08:15:12,460 --> 08:15:13,460
100%.

2705
08:15:13,460 --> 08:15:23,460
And it took therapy for me to realize that instead of just me being like, yes, rocks, crystals, frequencies.

2706
08:15:25,460 --> 08:15:27,460
Yeah, psychologist is not a doctor.

2707
08:15:27,460 --> 08:15:33,460
There's also a difference between a psychologist, a therapist, and a psychiatrist.

2708
08:15:33,460 --> 08:15:36,460
They are different things.

2709
08:15:36,460 --> 08:15:38,460
How does this do an eczema?

2710
08:15:38,460 --> 08:15:39,460
Some days it gets super bad.

2711
08:15:39,460 --> 08:15:41,460
Taking skin, lots of cocoa butter lotion.

2712
08:15:41,460 --> 08:15:43,460
Yeah, exactly.

2713
08:15:43,460 --> 08:15:49,460
And then, yeah, with my dermatolomaniac, I had even like a sort of body dysmorphia.

2714
08:15:49,460 --> 08:15:52,460
Because I always felt like something was wrong.

2715
08:15:52,460 --> 08:15:55,460
If something was on my skin, it was very weird.

2716
08:15:58,460 --> 08:16:01,460
It's like those chiropractor videos where the girl starts crying from the stress release

2717
08:16:01,460 --> 08:16:04,460
and the doctor stops her from apologizing and crying and reassures her.

2718
08:16:04,460 --> 08:16:05,460
Yeah.

2719
08:16:05,460 --> 08:16:09,460
Like, there are things you kind of like talk about and you're like, holy shit, wait.

2720
08:16:09,460 --> 08:16:11,460
That makes so much sense.

2721
08:16:11,460 --> 08:16:13,460
It just took to talking to somebody else.

2722
08:16:13,460 --> 08:16:17,460
The reason why I go to a therapist and the reason why I don't talk to like friends about stuff.

2723
08:16:17,460 --> 08:16:18,460
Well, I do.

2724
08:16:18,460 --> 08:16:19,460
I do.

2725
08:16:19,460 --> 08:16:22,460
One of the reasons is because everybody has something going on.

2726
08:16:22,460 --> 08:16:25,460
You know, everybody has something going on.

2727
08:16:25,460 --> 08:16:31,460
You don't want to kind of dump stuff on people if you don't know.

2728
08:16:31,460 --> 08:16:35,460
And so I pick and choose my moments where I share things with friends and where, you know,

2729
08:16:35,460 --> 08:16:39,460
I just go to a licensed professional who's paid to listen to me, you know, trauma dump,

2730
08:16:39,460 --> 08:16:46,460
you know, because like I've been the person and I never minded this that at my last job,

2731
08:16:46,460 --> 08:16:47,460
everybody went to you.

2732
08:16:47,460 --> 08:16:51,460
Again, I was seen as the big sister.

2733
08:16:51,460 --> 08:17:05,460
I was seen as the person that everybody wanted me to help fix their issues or like give them advice.

2734
08:17:05,460 --> 08:17:06,460
Oh, God.

2735
08:17:06,460 --> 08:17:08,460
Oh, God.

2736
08:17:08,460 --> 08:17:10,460
Oh, hey.

2737
08:17:10,460 --> 08:17:12,460
Let me just a little slappy slap.

2738
08:17:12,460 --> 08:17:14,460
Damn it.

2739
08:17:14,460 --> 08:17:18,460
Ow.

2740
08:17:18,460 --> 08:17:25,460
Raina, you're on my arm and I can't really play.

2741
08:17:25,460 --> 08:17:28,460
And even customers again would tell me really deep things.

2742
08:17:28,460 --> 08:17:31,460
Like again, I've had customers telling me like, oh, my husband passed away recently.

2743
08:17:31,460 --> 08:17:32,460
I'm buying this.

2744
08:17:32,460 --> 08:17:34,460
Remember this of him.

2745
08:17:34,460 --> 08:17:37,460
I'm getting this fixed because this and this happened.

2746
08:17:37,460 --> 08:17:38,460
I lost a kid.

2747
08:17:38,460 --> 08:17:41,460
This happened.

2748
08:17:41,460 --> 08:17:43,460
My child doesn't speak to me anymore.

2749
08:17:43,460 --> 08:17:45,460
This isn't that.

2750
08:17:45,460 --> 08:17:49,460
Or just like my co-workers personal lives.

2751
08:17:49,460 --> 08:17:56,460
And it was a lot, but I can compartmentalize that stuff.

2752
08:17:56,460 --> 08:17:59,460
But at some point, you know, it does become mentally exhausting.

2753
08:17:59,460 --> 08:18:05,460
And that's why it's important not to tax your friends with that stuff.

2754
08:18:05,460 --> 08:18:08,460
And it's also important when your friend is venting to you.

2755
08:18:08,460 --> 08:18:16,460
And I learned this from one of my co-workers who is talking to me about his wife.

2756
08:18:16,460 --> 08:18:19,460
He was just like, I love my wife so much.

2757
08:18:19,460 --> 08:18:21,460
She's the great, we have amazing communication and blah, blah, blah.

2758
08:18:21,460 --> 08:18:25,460
I don't know why I pressed that.

2759
08:18:25,460 --> 08:18:37,460
But he said, always ask when someone is asking you for help or venting to you if they want a solution.

2760
08:18:38,460 --> 08:18:43,460
Or if they want just to vent.

2761
08:18:43,460 --> 08:18:50,460
Because sometimes people say things to you.

2762
08:18:50,460 --> 08:18:52,460
Come back here.

2763
08:18:52,460 --> 08:18:55,460
Damn it.

2764
08:18:55,460 --> 08:19:02,460
Open up.

2765
08:19:02,460 --> 08:19:05,460
Really, he backs up sometimes.

2766
08:19:05,460 --> 08:19:15,460
Where am I?

2767
08:19:15,460 --> 08:19:20,460
Because you don't want to start, somebody's venting to you and then you just start telling them what they should be doing.

2768
08:19:20,460 --> 08:19:25,460
It's not going to do anything for them.

2769
08:19:25,460 --> 08:19:30,460
Damn, I was close for that one.

2770
08:19:30,460 --> 08:19:32,460
It's really not.

2771
08:19:32,460 --> 08:19:37,460
They're not going to listen to you because they just think you're just wordbombing on them.

2772
08:19:37,460 --> 08:19:44,460
Shibi, how do I recover from the trauma of recommending someone a show and they don't watch it until someone else recommends it to them?

2773
08:19:44,460 --> 08:19:48,460
If that's true, I'll be real with you.

2774
08:19:48,460 --> 08:19:58,460
They probably don't value your opinion as much as they should.

2775
08:19:58,460 --> 08:20:08,460
Or they want multiple people to reassure them that's the right decision and that's on them, that's not on you.

2776
08:20:08,460 --> 08:20:12,460
A show, by the way, now I want to know.

2777
08:20:12,460 --> 08:20:20,460
With that, would you add to have understanding of a person who tells you they can't help you with right now because they have stuff going on and you have to respect that as a person?

2778
08:20:20,460 --> 08:20:22,460
Exactly.

2779
08:20:22,460 --> 08:20:27,460
Sometimes I would have one of my friends come up to me and be like, hey, can I talk to you about something?

2780
08:20:27,460 --> 08:20:30,460
And I'm like, I'm sorry, I generally just don't have the mental capacity for that right now.

2781
08:20:30,460 --> 08:20:31,460
And they're like, okay, I understand.

2782
08:20:31,460 --> 08:20:33,460
I'm like, don't take it, please don't take it personally.

2783
08:20:33,460 --> 08:20:34,460
I have my own stuff going on.

2784
08:20:34,460 --> 08:20:37,460
Please tell me in like a day.

2785
08:20:37,460 --> 08:20:38,460
And then I got you.

2786
08:20:38,460 --> 08:20:46,460
Oh, fuck.

2787
08:20:46,460 --> 08:20:51,460
Okay, Rena, you're on my arm and I can't move that well.

2788
08:20:52,460 --> 08:20:53,460
I'll take the first answer.

2789
08:20:53,460 --> 08:20:57,460
Thank you.

2790
08:20:57,460 --> 08:20:58,460
Yeah.

2791
08:20:58,460 --> 08:20:59,460
Do you want someone to talk to you?

2792
08:20:59,460 --> 08:21:00,460
Someone to vent to?

2793
08:21:00,460 --> 08:21:05,460
Yeah.

2794
08:21:05,460 --> 08:21:10,460
I think the second venting versus finding solutions is something that drives my mom up the wall when I try to help.

2795
08:21:10,460 --> 08:21:14,460
Yeah.

2796
08:21:14,460 --> 08:21:20,460
Like, and I, and I had to tell my parents that too.

2797
08:21:20,460 --> 08:21:28,460
Because again, like, you're still your parents, you're still like their kid and whatever.

2798
08:21:28,460 --> 08:21:33,460
And I remember I would talk to my mom and my mom would just try to give me advice.

2799
08:21:33,460 --> 08:21:36,460
And I'm like, that's not, I just want to talk to you right now.

2800
08:21:36,460 --> 08:21:39,460
You know, I don't want, I'm not looking for advice.

2801
08:21:39,460 --> 08:21:40,460
I know what I'm supposed to be doing.

2802
08:21:40,460 --> 08:21:43,460
I just need to talk about it.

2803
08:21:43,460 --> 08:21:55,460
And then when I trust that to her, she then she started to really, really listen to me a lot more and then our relationship got better.

2804
08:21:55,460 --> 08:22:04,460
Jesus, I can't dodge right now.

2805
08:22:04,460 --> 08:22:07,460
Oh, God.

2806
08:22:07,460 --> 08:22:09,460
I'm already almost dead.

2807
08:22:09,460 --> 08:22:10,460
I hate them so much.

2808
08:22:10,460 --> 08:22:12,460
I don't have to beat them off stream.

2809
08:22:12,460 --> 08:22:18,460
100% boundaries are very important.

2810
08:22:18,460 --> 08:22:23,460
It's a very important, but it's also like, nobody's going to know what you're thinking unless you say it.

2811
08:22:23,460 --> 08:22:31,460
You know, if you, if somebody slights you and you feel fronted and you start like, don't be passive aggressive.

2812
08:22:31,460 --> 08:22:34,460
That's not the, you're an adult.

2813
08:22:34,460 --> 08:22:35,460
You talk to them.

2814
08:22:35,460 --> 08:22:39,460
You say, Hey, I have an issue with how you approach this.

2815
08:22:39,460 --> 08:22:42,460
That's the type of person that I am.

2816
08:22:42,460 --> 08:22:52,460
If I never got into fights with anybody, one, because I was tall and people were intimidated by my height.

2817
08:22:52,460 --> 08:23:00,460
And two, because the moment I heard that something was wrong, that somebody was just like, Oh, so and so is talking shit about you.

2818
08:23:00,460 --> 08:23:02,460
This is like high school, by the way.

2819
08:23:02,460 --> 08:23:04,460
I immediately go to the person to be like, Hey, what's up?

2820
08:23:04,460 --> 08:23:06,460
Snip this in the butt.

2821
08:23:06,460 --> 08:23:08,460
What's going on?

2822
08:23:08,460 --> 08:23:09,460
So I don't fuck with that.

2823
08:23:09,460 --> 08:23:12,460
I don't fuck with that.

2824
08:23:12,460 --> 08:23:17,460
I don't need the extra silliness, you know.

2825
08:23:17,460 --> 08:23:18,460
Nobody does.

2826
08:23:18,460 --> 08:23:26,460
Nobody needs extra silliness.

2827
08:23:26,460 --> 08:23:27,460
Die.

2828
08:23:27,460 --> 08:23:28,460
Die.

2829
08:23:28,460 --> 08:23:29,460
Die.

2830
08:23:29,460 --> 08:23:30,460
Oh.

2831
08:23:30,460 --> 08:23:32,460
I got grabbed by the other one.

2832
08:23:32,460 --> 08:23:40,460
Are you serious, bro?

2833
08:23:40,460 --> 08:23:46,460
Oh my God.

2834
08:23:46,460 --> 08:23:49,460
This isn't fair.

2835
08:23:49,460 --> 08:23:50,460
They lining up on you.

2836
08:23:50,460 --> 08:23:57,460
I'm getting a train in on me by these abducer, abductor virgins.

2837
08:23:57,460 --> 08:23:59,460
But yeah.

2838
08:23:59,460 --> 08:24:02,460
Chiwi's in a yapping mood, not a slapping mood.

2839
08:24:02,460 --> 08:24:03,460
And boss is on the worst.

2840
08:24:03,460 --> 08:24:04,460
They really are, though.

2841
08:24:04,460 --> 08:24:05,460
Hello.

2842
08:24:05,460 --> 08:24:06,460
Hello.

2843
08:24:06,460 --> 08:24:07,460
Welcome in.

2844
08:24:07,460 --> 08:24:09,460
No one has the same sphere of knowledge.

2845
08:24:09,460 --> 08:24:11,460
Most problems stem from assumption.

2846
08:24:11,460 --> 08:24:12,460
Exactly.

2847
08:24:12,460 --> 08:24:21,460
And this is what, and this is kind of what bothers me about being the VTB community, because again, everything's online.

2848
08:24:21,460 --> 08:24:25,460
People usually talk over DMs.

2849
08:24:25,460 --> 08:24:26,460
And this hasn't happened to me or anything, by the way.

2850
08:24:26,460 --> 08:24:31,460
It's just something I've observed.

2851
08:24:31,460 --> 08:24:44,460
I see that so there's so many miscommunications, so much drama that comes off of things that could be easily spoken over to in a call.

2852
08:24:44,460 --> 08:24:53,460
And also people just taking something too far just for the sake of it, because they get some sort of adrenaline after participating in drama, you know.

2853
08:24:53,460 --> 08:25:00,460
And people also just like, they've been like assumptions a lot in VTB.

2854
08:25:00,460 --> 08:25:08,460
That's kind of to be expected, though, because you kind of, how could you not assume things, you know?

2855
08:25:08,460 --> 08:25:11,460
Oh, please.

2856
08:25:11,460 --> 08:25:13,460
I need to get them away from each other.

2857
08:25:13,460 --> 08:25:16,460
That's what I need to do.

2858
08:25:16,460 --> 08:25:20,460
Get a trainer and on you by virgins in the wild.

2859
08:25:20,460 --> 08:25:23,460
It has to be relic of football.

2860
08:25:23,460 --> 08:25:30,460
One thing that drives me nuts is when everyone has a problem that needs fixing and talk around in circles and wants to do instead of humming about it.

2861
08:25:30,460 --> 08:25:31,460
Very true.

2862
08:25:31,460 --> 08:25:36,460
Again, actions speak louder than words.

2863
08:25:36,460 --> 08:25:38,460
You just want to do something.

2864
08:25:38,460 --> 08:25:39,460
If you see something's wrong, just do it.

2865
08:25:39,460 --> 08:25:41,460
Just like, just act on it.

2866
08:25:41,460 --> 08:25:43,460
If necessary, you know, ask for permission.

2867
08:25:43,460 --> 08:25:47,460
If you need to be like, hey, when you have this conversation, I would like to have this conversation with you.

2868
08:25:47,460 --> 08:25:50,460
Are you able to have it right now?

2869
08:25:50,460 --> 08:25:57,460
And also know that everybody has different ways of receiving feedback.

2870
08:25:57,460 --> 08:26:01,460
Some people want it told to them straight.

2871
08:26:01,460 --> 08:26:04,460
And some people need, they can't handle that.

2872
08:26:04,460 --> 08:26:08,460
Like, I'm the type of person.

2873
08:26:08,460 --> 08:26:11,460
And me and my dad the exact same way.

2874
08:26:11,460 --> 08:26:16,460
Like, and my mom knew how to handle me better because how much I'm similar to my dad.

2875
08:26:16,460 --> 08:26:19,460
But like, so my mom is the type of person.

2876
08:26:19,460 --> 08:26:26,460
So if you get into, if you get into like a little scuffle, a little kerfuffle with her, she needs to talk about it immediately.

2877
08:26:26,460 --> 08:26:33,460
Which is what I've learned to do is actually, as I've had it, I've hit a balance with the saving it for later and talking about it immediately.

2878
08:26:33,460 --> 08:26:40,460
But my dad's the type of person where he needs to kind of think about stuff and come back to it.

2879
08:26:40,460 --> 08:26:50,460
Everybody talks and communicates differently and you, there's nothing wrong with asking a person how they communicate, you know?

2880
08:26:50,460 --> 08:26:57,460
If someone's just like, I would like to be very blunt with me, then be blunt with them.

2881
08:26:57,460 --> 08:27:03,460
If someone's like, I can't handle that and I need to think about stuff for a little bit, then respect them.

2882
08:27:03,460 --> 08:27:05,460
Respect their respect that.

2883
08:27:05,460 --> 08:27:09,460
Because eventually you'll get to the solution you need to.

2884
08:27:09,460 --> 08:27:13,460
Oh, fuck. I thought I was going to dodge in time.

2885
08:27:13,460 --> 08:27:16,460
Look at them hold. They're waiting for me.

2886
08:27:16,460 --> 08:27:18,460
Irina.

2887
08:27:22,460 --> 08:27:28,460
Perfect example. The roof is leaking. We need to fix. We have no money, so I propose you put a tarp outside the roof.

2888
08:27:28,460 --> 08:27:35,460
No, it's, no, it's too much money. Okay, a few months later, the roof is sacking from water damage.

2889
08:27:35,460 --> 08:27:37,460
Yup.

2890
08:27:37,460 --> 08:27:43,460
It's also like, it's a slippery slope because everybody has a different opinion. Everybody has a different solution on how they want to do things.

2891
08:27:43,460 --> 08:27:56,460
And it's kind of up to the group, excuse me, how they, how they want to have a compromise to fix it, you know?

2892
08:27:56,460 --> 08:28:00,460
Again, that's all it comes down to communication, communication, communication, communication.

2893
08:28:00,460 --> 08:28:16,460
This goes for normal relationships too. They'll be your parents, your friends, your spouse, your boyfriends, girlfriends, situationships.

2894
08:28:16,460 --> 08:28:21,460
I've learned a lot from my therapist in general because I'll ask her questions. He's very open.

2895
08:28:21,460 --> 08:28:30,460
And I'll be like, how would you approach someone like this? Because I'll, you know, I'll vent to people venting to me to be like, hey, this person told me this, what the fuck do I do about it?

2896
08:28:30,460 --> 08:28:41,460
Like one of my coworkers is being harassed by someone and I'm like, how the fuck do I approach this? And then she's like, well, go to HR and I'm like, well, yeah, but like, what else?

2897
08:28:41,460 --> 08:28:51,460
I wish I could parry that somehow.

2898
08:28:51,460 --> 08:29:04,460
Okay, I don't think I'm getting a lot of volcano mirror anytime soon. I don't think I might just get those dectas medallions.

2899
08:29:04,460 --> 08:29:26,460
You die the behind your time when the name seems to abduct your chats. And every problem needs an immediate resolution, but it does need a solution. Yes, a very good friend taught me that.

2900
08:29:26,460 --> 08:29:31,460
Oh, man, I'm crying. I'm fucking crying. I hate this muppet. Oh, why are you crying? Oh, don't cry.

2901
08:29:31,460 --> 08:29:33,460
You don't cry.

2902
08:29:33,460 --> 08:29:42,460
Person who over things in a combo. So I'm not sure how best to communicate. Just say that. Just say that. Just tell people, hey, I tend to overthink a lot.

2903
08:29:42,460 --> 08:29:59,460
I need you to reassure me or I need you to be very explicit with me what you're trying to say. Like I need you to really be blunt in order for me to understand because I'm going to overthink it.

2904
08:29:59,460 --> 08:30:05,460
Because I know I do that sometimes. Again, I'm not a perfect person. I'm not a perfect muppet.

2905
08:30:05,460 --> 08:30:18,460
Somebody tells me something and my mind's going a thousand miles per hour. It was a porn hour. Why do people fight over here, by the way? I'm kind of confused by that. What's over here?

2906
08:30:26,460 --> 08:30:28,460
Why are so many people dying over here?

2907
08:30:36,460 --> 08:30:40,460
I'm a little confused.

2908
08:30:40,460 --> 08:30:44,460
Maybe invasions. Oh, that makes sense.

2909
08:30:44,460 --> 08:30:50,460
I spammed buttons to break out. It's not working.

2910
08:30:50,460 --> 08:30:56,460
I know they're weak to electric. I don't have anything electric for them.

2911
08:30:57,460 --> 08:31:06,460
I could try to craft some electric shit.

2912
08:31:06,460 --> 08:31:16,460
My health is too low. What are you talking about? Who are you? Get out of here. Nobody asked you to speak.

2913
08:31:16,460 --> 08:31:25,460
Cookbook search? Yeah, I'm thinking I might need to get a lightning cookbook out of the fuck it's called.

2914
08:31:25,460 --> 08:31:27,460
Wait.

2915
08:31:27,460 --> 08:31:34,460
Can I knock it out of here? Okay, I can. Thank God.

2916
08:31:34,460 --> 08:31:41,460
I'm wondering if there probably isn't another way for me to get out.

2917
08:31:41,460 --> 08:31:45,460
What was I going to do?

2918
08:31:45,460 --> 08:31:48,460
I'm going to get out of here.

2919
08:31:48,460 --> 08:32:00,460
What was I going to do?

2920
08:32:00,460 --> 08:32:10,460
Gally haven't been to the plateau yet? No, because I'm going to fucking these motherfuckers for an hour or two.

2921
08:32:10,460 --> 08:32:15,460
I just beat Rinala.

2922
08:32:15,460 --> 08:32:20,460
I need to get to the fucking plateau so I can get to Radon.

2923
08:32:20,460 --> 08:32:28,460
But these bitches are in the way.

2924
08:32:28,460 --> 08:32:37,460
If they hardlocked me in there, I would brute force it off stream. Don't even worry about it. Just like I did with the worm.

2925
08:32:37,460 --> 08:32:42,460
But yeah, I hope you guys kind of get what I'm saying.

2926
08:32:42,460 --> 08:32:47,460
I like being real with you guys sometimes.

2927
08:32:47,460 --> 08:32:52,460
Where is the nearest lightning fucking cookbook?

2928
08:32:52,460 --> 08:32:58,460
I often catch astrophys when I text people and they don't respond quickly and chatting in the stream has actually been helping me get over that a bit.

2929
08:32:58,460 --> 08:33:05,460
That's good. That's good. I get that. Sometimes if people don't respond right away, I'm like they hate me.

2930
08:33:06,460 --> 08:33:14,460
I said something to her the other day and she just totally ignored it.

2931
08:33:14,460 --> 08:33:16,460
She hates me.

2932
08:33:16,460 --> 08:33:20,460
And then literally like five minutes later, she's like, I'm so sorry I didn't see this.

2933
08:33:20,460 --> 08:33:26,460
I'm so sorry. She's profusely apologizing.

2934
08:33:26,460 --> 08:33:33,460
And then sometimes our minds tend to stretch things.

2935
08:33:33,460 --> 08:33:36,460
You too, Shibi.

2936
08:33:40,460 --> 08:33:45,460
You also have to think about people have other lives. They have stuff to do. They got stuff going on.

2937
08:33:45,460 --> 08:33:49,460
And sometimes I'll be honest with you. Sometimes I don't feel like responding to people.

2938
08:33:49,460 --> 08:33:55,460
Sometimes I'm just peopled out and I just don't feel like talking.

2939
08:33:56,460 --> 08:34:06,460
Sometimes people will text me and I will leave them unread because I'm just not mentally equipped to talk to somebody right now.

2940
08:34:09,460 --> 08:34:11,460
What? Mesh bat and blast.

2941
08:34:11,460 --> 08:34:15,460
Get me out. Get me out. Get me out. Get me out. I'm dead.

2942
08:34:15,460 --> 08:34:17,460
As it doesn't work.

2943
08:34:20,460 --> 08:34:23,460
And again, are you like two different time zooms? Exactly. That's not a factor.

2944
08:34:24,460 --> 08:34:26,460
There's so many different factors.

2945
08:34:26,460 --> 08:34:29,460
Remember how Mercy explained she didn't think she got in.

2946
08:34:29,460 --> 08:34:32,460
So she messaged Stroni and she was like, oh, you're actually in.

2947
08:34:32,460 --> 08:34:34,460
Should you be like that?

2948
08:34:37,460 --> 08:34:40,460
And then it's also to talk to personalities.

2949
08:34:40,460 --> 08:34:42,460
Stroni's a little forgetful.

2950
08:34:42,460 --> 08:34:45,460
And again, also different time zones.

2951
08:34:45,460 --> 08:34:48,460
I'm tired of tired of doing this.

2952
08:34:54,460 --> 08:34:58,460
I've tried to stream until Mercy comes on.

2953
08:34:58,460 --> 08:35:00,460
It's not going to read into her.

2954
08:35:00,460 --> 08:35:02,460
I don't remember what she's doing today.

2955
08:35:02,460 --> 08:35:05,460
I haven't looked at the schedule. I need to work on my schedule for next week.

2956
08:35:05,460 --> 08:35:07,460
Happy 4th of July!

2957
08:35:09,460 --> 08:35:13,460
The book is in the Wyndham.

2958
08:35:13,460 --> 08:35:14,460
Wyndham.

2959
08:35:14,460 --> 08:35:16,460
Catacombs.

2960
08:35:17,460 --> 08:35:19,460
Is there still streaming?

2961
08:35:19,460 --> 08:35:21,460
Yeah, I wanted to.

2962
08:35:21,460 --> 08:35:22,460
I didn't even know.

2963
08:35:22,460 --> 08:35:24,460
I haven't looked at any of the schedules today.

2964
08:35:24,460 --> 08:35:26,460
I didn't see know who was streaming.

2965
08:35:26,460 --> 08:35:28,460
Streaming Super Mario RPG.

2966
08:35:28,460 --> 08:35:31,460
Send a message to my friend who's on vacation on WhatsApp today.

2967
08:35:31,460 --> 08:35:33,460
And he didn't answer it.

2968
08:35:33,460 --> 08:35:35,460
And I remembered he just doesn't have WhatsApp anymore.

2969
08:35:35,460 --> 08:35:36,460
That too.

2970
08:35:36,460 --> 08:35:37,460
It's just like...

2971
08:35:37,460 --> 08:35:39,460
Or people have really bad reception.

2972
08:35:40,460 --> 08:35:42,460
You know?

2973
08:35:48,460 --> 08:35:50,460
Fuck you.

2974
08:35:51,460 --> 08:35:53,460
Fuck you.

2975
08:35:57,460 --> 08:35:58,460
I don't like you.

2976
08:35:58,460 --> 08:36:00,460
Why does there have to be two of you?

2977
08:36:06,460 --> 08:36:07,460
Maybe another play.

2978
08:36:07,460 --> 08:36:09,460
I'm not doing that.

2979
08:36:12,460 --> 08:36:14,460
Yeah, we're streaming up next to mine.

2980
08:36:14,460 --> 08:36:16,460
Thank you for your support, everybody.

2981
08:36:16,460 --> 08:36:18,460
I really appreciate that.

2982
08:36:19,460 --> 08:36:21,460
Um...

2983
08:36:23,460 --> 08:36:24,460
Yeah.

2984
08:36:25,460 --> 08:36:27,460
A lot of things could be solved.

2985
08:36:29,460 --> 08:36:32,460
If people just communicated or weren't scared to.

2986
08:36:33,460 --> 08:36:35,460
Then people have reasons to be scared to.

2987
08:36:35,460 --> 08:36:37,460
Which you know, you can't blame them for it all.

2988
08:36:38,460 --> 08:36:41,460
You want to just gap for the rest of the stream and you beat them off stream?

2989
08:36:41,460 --> 08:36:42,460
I might do that.

2990
08:36:42,460 --> 08:36:47,460
I'm gonna keep talking and fight them half-handedly.

2991
08:36:47,460 --> 08:36:49,460
Half-heartedly, but yeah.

2992
08:36:53,460 --> 08:36:55,460
What if I do?

2993
08:37:01,460 --> 08:37:04,460
Maybe the wolfies will distract them.

2994
08:37:06,460 --> 08:37:08,460
Because they'll be bouncing around.

2995
08:37:17,460 --> 08:37:18,460
Yeah.

2996
08:37:32,460 --> 08:37:34,460
Trying to grab the dogs.

2997
08:37:43,460 --> 08:37:45,460
Dogs are actually helping.

2998
08:37:48,460 --> 08:37:49,460
Oh.

2999
08:37:54,460 --> 08:37:55,460
I'm dead.

3000
08:37:55,460 --> 08:37:56,460
Oh, not dead.

3001
08:38:04,460 --> 08:38:05,460
I'm almost dead.

3002
08:38:06,460 --> 08:38:07,460
No!

3003
08:38:12,460 --> 08:38:13,460
No!

3004
08:38:13,460 --> 08:38:14,460
Oh, he grabbed me.

3005
08:38:18,460 --> 08:38:20,460
I don't know if there's a stat spread.

3006
08:38:20,460 --> 08:38:22,460
Um, I'll show you in a second.

3007
08:38:25,460 --> 08:38:28,460
Do you not zoom in on the fucking virgin crotch?

3008
08:38:28,460 --> 08:38:29,460
It's kind of weird.

3009
08:38:31,460 --> 08:38:33,460
Am I scared to communicate?

3010
08:38:33,460 --> 08:38:34,460
You just suck at it.

3011
08:38:34,460 --> 08:38:35,460
But why?

3012
08:38:35,460 --> 08:38:36,460
Why do you think you suck at it?

3013
08:38:36,460 --> 08:38:38,460
Why do you think you suck at communicating?

3014
08:38:41,460 --> 08:38:42,460
You know?

3015
08:38:43,460 --> 08:38:45,460
Do you think, do you like stutter?

3016
08:38:45,460 --> 08:38:47,460
Do you think you can't form your words properly?

3017
08:38:47,460 --> 08:38:49,460
Okay, what can you do to fix that?

3018
08:38:49,460 --> 08:38:50,460
You know?

3019
08:38:53,460 --> 08:38:55,460
I practice a lot of shit in the mirror.

3020
08:38:55,460 --> 08:38:58,460
Honestly, streaming helps a lot with me talking.

3021
08:39:02,460 --> 08:39:04,460
Then again, I worked in customer service,

3022
08:39:04,460 --> 08:39:05,460
but I had to address a lot of people,

3023
08:39:05,460 --> 08:39:07,460
so that was also a big help.

3024
08:39:07,460 --> 08:39:09,460
Otherwise, I couldn't talk at all.

3025
08:39:09,460 --> 08:39:11,460
I was almost like a fucking slut.

3026
08:39:11,460 --> 08:39:14,460
I was select to mute for a little bit when I was younger.

3027
08:39:16,460 --> 08:39:20,460
Going back to the thing about your esthetician,

3028
08:39:20,460 --> 08:39:21,460
knowing more about your therapist,

3029
08:39:21,460 --> 08:39:23,460
I teach my doctor about HRT

3030
08:39:23,460 --> 08:39:26,460
and provide him with my own research in order to get HRT.

3031
08:39:26,460 --> 08:39:28,460
That's when you go to a different doctor, though.

3032
08:39:28,460 --> 08:39:31,460
You want to go to a doctor that specializes in what you know.

3033
08:39:31,460 --> 08:39:34,460
You have to, you cannot just stay with a doctor

3034
08:39:34,460 --> 08:39:36,460
because it's familiar, you know?

3035
08:39:39,460 --> 08:39:42,460
I had to go to many different doctors

3036
08:39:42,460 --> 08:39:46,460
in order to figure out my fibromyalgia diagnosis,

3037
08:39:46,460 --> 08:39:48,460
and I'm still fighting for that.

3038
08:39:50,460 --> 08:39:53,460
It's officially recognized by state shit,

3039
08:39:53,460 --> 08:39:57,460
just like how Nikki Ray from Idol is dealing with it.

3040
08:39:57,460 --> 08:40:00,460
She just finally got approved for disability and stuff,

3041
08:40:00,460 --> 08:40:02,460
and I'm like, fuck props to her.

3042
08:40:02,460 --> 08:40:05,460
I want to do a fundraising thing with her at some point for fibro.

3043
08:40:05,460 --> 08:40:06,460
That would be amazing.

3044
08:40:06,460 --> 08:40:08,460
I'm definitely going to reach out to her about that.

3045
08:40:08,460 --> 08:40:10,460
She said it'd be cool.

3046
08:40:11,460 --> 08:40:13,460
I saw your communication.

3047
08:40:13,460 --> 08:40:15,460
I keep going.

3048
08:40:15,460 --> 08:40:20,460
Sometimes I just have trouble turning thoughts into words.

3049
08:40:22,460 --> 08:40:25,460
Then, you know, I think to fix that,

3050
08:40:25,460 --> 08:40:29,460
well, not to fix it, but like to practice to improve.

3051
08:40:29,460 --> 08:40:31,460
Just say what's on your mind,

3052
08:40:31,460 --> 08:40:33,460
not to anyone in particular.

3053
08:40:33,460 --> 08:40:35,460
Just like talk to yourself.

3054
08:40:37,460 --> 08:40:39,460
I talk to myself a lot.

3055
08:40:40,460 --> 08:40:42,460
It would have been a year-long wait to see a specialist

3056
08:40:42,460 --> 08:40:44,460
going to wait that long.

3057
08:40:44,460 --> 08:40:48,460
But don't you want to wait for the best type of care

3058
08:40:48,460 --> 08:40:50,460
that you want to get?

3059
08:40:50,460 --> 08:40:52,460
I understand.

3060
08:40:52,460 --> 08:40:55,460
Obviously, I don't know your circumstance.

3061
08:40:55,460 --> 08:41:00,460
You 100% can't wait.

3062
08:41:00,460 --> 08:41:04,460
And clearly, if your doctor is willing to learn

3063
08:41:04,460 --> 08:41:07,460
and willing to be more open-minded about that sort of thing,

3064
08:41:07,460 --> 08:41:09,460
then, of course, try to push the subject,

3065
08:41:09,460 --> 08:41:11,460
and you did, and it worked out.

3066
08:41:11,460 --> 08:41:13,460
Sometimes it's not a luxury.

3067
08:41:13,460 --> 08:41:15,460
So I'm like, hey, it doesn't work out.

3068
08:41:15,460 --> 08:41:16,460
Fuck them.

3069
08:41:16,460 --> 08:41:18,460
Fuck them and run.

3070
08:41:18,460 --> 08:41:20,460
Now, I'm almost dead.

3071
08:41:22,460 --> 08:41:27,460
Can you like just give me just a second?

3072
08:41:29,460 --> 08:41:31,460
Okay, who is going to be distracted?

3073
08:41:31,460 --> 08:41:33,460
You are.

3074
08:41:34,460 --> 08:41:39,460
I'm dead.

3075
08:41:49,460 --> 08:41:52,460
I sadly damage my voice from being in a high school metal band.

3076
08:41:52,460 --> 08:41:53,460
I can't raise my voice.

3077
08:41:53,460 --> 08:41:54,460
It's got more painful as I got older,

3078
08:41:54,460 --> 08:41:56,460
and it's infuriating when people tell me to raise my voice.

3079
08:41:56,460 --> 08:41:57,460
I'm like, that sucks.

3080
08:41:57,460 --> 08:41:59,460
I'm so sorry about that.

3081
08:42:00,460 --> 08:42:03,460
I know, like, I would love to learn how to scream,

3082
08:42:03,460 --> 08:42:06,460
but, again, it does strain your voice,

3083
08:42:06,460 --> 08:42:09,460
and you have to really learn how to do it properly.

3084
08:42:12,460 --> 08:42:15,460
And that's like, you know, speech therapy.

3085
08:42:15,460 --> 08:42:19,460
It's hard when you damage your voice like that.

3086
08:42:21,460 --> 08:42:24,460
And, again, you don't want to have to keep explaining to people

3087
08:42:24,460 --> 08:42:28,460
the reason why you can't, you know.

3088
08:42:30,460 --> 08:42:31,460
That sucks.

3089
08:42:31,460 --> 08:42:33,460
I'm really sorry about that.

3090
08:42:33,460 --> 08:42:35,460
I had to go through so many doctors and specialists

3091
08:42:35,460 --> 08:42:37,460
for my health issues, even with good insurance.

3092
08:42:37,460 --> 08:42:39,460
So many doctors wanted to avoid any actual tests

3093
08:42:39,460 --> 08:42:41,460
to help figure out what the issue was.

3094
08:42:41,460 --> 08:42:43,460
I feel that's so hard.

3095
08:42:43,460 --> 08:42:44,460
I feel that's so hard.

3096
08:42:44,460 --> 08:42:48,460
You do not know how much money I am medically in debt

3097
08:42:48,460 --> 08:42:51,460
because I'm seeing specialists after specialists,

3098
08:42:51,460 --> 08:42:53,460
not even just for fibro,

3099
08:42:53,460 --> 08:42:57,460
but for, like, skin stuff, mental health stuff,

3100
08:42:57,460 --> 08:43:00,460
physical stuff, physical therapy.

3101
08:43:03,460 --> 08:43:04,460
So much shit.

3102
08:43:06,460 --> 08:43:07,460
So much stupid shit.

3103
08:43:07,460 --> 08:43:09,460
Oh, God, I should have done this earlier.

3104
08:43:12,460 --> 08:43:13,460
All right.

3105
08:43:13,460 --> 08:43:14,460
Now I'm down the road.

3106
08:43:15,460 --> 08:43:16,460
Hey, man.

3107
08:43:16,460 --> 08:43:18,460
I'm gonna kill you.

3108
08:43:22,460 --> 08:43:24,460
I hope you keep a good eye on me.

3109
08:43:25,460 --> 08:43:26,460
Yeah.

3110
08:43:34,460 --> 08:43:37,460
When I was younger, I always felt like I had a mask,

3111
08:43:37,460 --> 08:43:38,460
never saying what I was thinking,

3112
08:43:38,460 --> 08:43:40,460
but after shedding a few years ago,

3113
08:43:40,460 --> 08:43:43,460
communication is so much easier and we weren't fulfilling.

3114
08:43:43,460 --> 08:43:46,460
I am actually still struggling with that to this day.

3115
08:43:46,460 --> 08:43:48,460
I 100% mask.

3116
08:43:48,460 --> 08:43:51,460
I didn't know how much I masked

3117
08:43:51,460 --> 08:43:56,460
because growing up, again, very religious,

3118
08:43:56,460 --> 08:43:59,460
there was different expectations on behavior.

3119
08:43:59,460 --> 08:44:06,460
And so I would change my behavior so I could fit in so much.

3120
08:44:06,460 --> 08:44:12,460
And only, like, in the past few years, have I really realized

3121
08:44:15,460 --> 08:44:17,460
how much I hide, how I am.

3122
08:44:17,460 --> 08:44:20,460
And even, like, something that stuck out to me,

3123
08:44:20,460 --> 08:44:22,460
when I was starting VTubing,

3124
08:44:22,460 --> 08:44:24,460
is someone said to me,

3125
08:44:24,460 --> 08:44:27,460
I can tell she's not being herself.

3126
08:44:27,460 --> 08:44:30,460
I can tell she's hiding herself.

3127
08:44:30,460 --> 08:44:34,460
And then my goal was to, if anything,

3128
08:44:34,460 --> 08:44:36,460
I should be my true self on the internet.

3129
08:44:36,460 --> 08:44:38,460
Nobody knows what the fuck I am, you know?

3130
08:44:38,460 --> 08:44:40,460
So much anonymity.

3131
08:44:40,460 --> 08:44:43,460
I shouldn't have to worry about that shit, you know?

3132
08:44:43,460 --> 08:44:45,460
You know?

3133
08:44:49,460 --> 08:44:51,460
Alrighty.

3134
08:44:51,460 --> 08:44:54,460
Grab my party divide.

3135
08:44:54,460 --> 08:44:59,460
But yeah, and then that's why I'm working,

3136
08:44:59,460 --> 08:45:02,460
because I realize, like, I stim, I repeat stuff,

3137
08:45:02,460 --> 08:45:05,460
I have echolalia, I have a bunch of other shit.

3138
08:45:05,460 --> 08:45:07,460
Again, I'm no professional.

3139
08:45:07,460 --> 08:45:10,460
I'm not a huge fan of how some people self-diagnose,

3140
08:45:10,460 --> 08:45:13,460
you know, sometimes the first step in getting to an actual diagnosis

3141
08:45:13,460 --> 08:45:16,460
is a self-diagnosis within reason, of course.

3142
08:45:16,460 --> 08:45:20,460
The people who go on and say that they have fucking alters and DID

3143
08:45:20,460 --> 08:45:25,460
piss me the fuck off, because it takes away

3144
08:45:25,460 --> 08:45:27,460
from the people who actually have the issue

3145
08:45:27,460 --> 08:45:29,460
and makes them seem less serious.

3146
08:45:29,460 --> 08:45:32,460
That is one of my least favorite things.

3147
08:45:32,460 --> 08:45:36,460
I think they have some, it's a pet peeve of mine.

3148
08:45:37,460 --> 08:45:41,460
As someone I have worked in human services,

3149
08:45:41,460 --> 08:45:45,460
I took care of adults with mental and physical disabilities

3150
08:45:45,460 --> 08:45:49,460
and behavioral issues, and people pretending to go

3151
08:45:49,460 --> 08:45:53,460
what people go through as a little quirk pisses me the fuck off,

3152
08:45:53,460 --> 08:45:55,460
because they have no fucking idea.

3153
08:45:55,460 --> 08:45:58,460
They have no idea what the fuck I work with.

3154
08:45:59,460 --> 08:46:06,460
One of my people I took care of had schizophrenia.

3155
08:46:06,460 --> 08:46:09,460
She was one of the sweetest people in the world.

3156
08:46:09,460 --> 08:46:12,460
She passed away recently, it was really sad.

3157
08:46:12,460 --> 08:46:17,460
I still have a playlist I made around my phone.

3158
08:46:17,460 --> 08:46:22,460
It's time to get a little emotional and think about her.

3159
08:46:22,460 --> 08:46:27,460
And then people just pretending to be quirky

3160
08:46:27,460 --> 08:46:29,460
with schizophrenia and stuff.

3161
08:46:29,460 --> 08:46:31,460
They're like, oh yeah, I talk to people.

3162
08:46:31,460 --> 08:46:32,460
There's people there.

3163
08:46:32,460 --> 08:46:34,460
I'm like, are you fucking stupid?

3164
08:46:34,460 --> 08:46:38,460
You have no idea what people struggle with.

3165
08:46:40,460 --> 08:46:43,460
I feel like I'm a lot like myself now.

3166
08:46:45,460 --> 08:46:49,460
My alter is minor in internet celebrity, oh brother.

3167
08:46:50,460 --> 08:46:53,460
It's like, no, you're just weird and you have a tulpa.

3168
08:46:57,460 --> 08:46:58,460
It's that kind of stuff.

3169
08:46:58,460 --> 08:47:00,460
That's why I'm very wary.

3170
08:47:00,460 --> 08:47:05,460
People be like, oh, my chat will joke when I was written up

3171
08:47:05,460 --> 08:47:11,460
that I was autistic and that I have ADHD.

3172
08:47:11,460 --> 08:47:14,460
And I'm like, no, I don't.

3173
08:47:14,460 --> 08:47:18,460
And now I'm reconsidering.

3174
08:47:18,460 --> 08:47:19,460
I don't have autism.

3175
08:47:19,460 --> 08:47:22,460
I know I don't fucking have autism.

3176
08:47:22,460 --> 08:47:26,460
But now I'm reconsidering if I have adult ADHD.

3177
08:47:26,460 --> 08:47:29,460
And I'm just like, huh, I do experience a lot of these symptoms.

3178
08:47:29,460 --> 08:47:32,460
I thought they were OCD related, but they're not.

3179
08:47:32,460 --> 08:47:34,460
Maybe I should look into that.

3180
08:47:34,460 --> 08:47:36,460
There's nothing wrong with that.

3181
08:47:36,460 --> 08:47:40,460
And I'll make jokes about it like, ah, sorry, it's my ADHD.

3182
08:47:40,460 --> 08:47:44,460
But I also say I don't fucking have it officially diagnosed.

3183
08:47:44,460 --> 08:47:50,460
But I also don't make it a part of my personality.

3184
08:47:50,460 --> 08:47:56,460
And some people do that are self-diagnosed.

3185
08:47:58,460 --> 08:48:01,460
I don't like when people make labels as part of their personality.

3186
08:48:01,460 --> 08:48:03,460
You're so much more than that, you know?

3187
08:48:03,460 --> 08:48:05,460
So much more than that.

3188
08:48:05,460 --> 08:48:19,460
So many different other facets to your being besides your mental illnesses,

3189
08:48:19,460 --> 08:48:22,460
what you identify as, who you love.

3190
08:48:22,460 --> 08:48:28,460
Not that those things don't matter, because they do.

3191
08:48:28,460 --> 08:48:30,460
They're also a big part of you.

3192
08:48:31,460 --> 08:48:33,460
But yeah.

3193
08:48:42,460 --> 08:48:44,460
I have a friend in BPD.

3194
08:48:44,460 --> 08:48:45,460
She's such an amazing person.

3195
08:48:45,460 --> 08:48:46,460
Yeah.

3196
08:48:46,460 --> 08:48:48,460
People at BPD have a bad rap.

3197
08:48:51,460 --> 08:48:53,460
I'll be honest with you.

3198
08:48:53,460 --> 08:48:58,460
I had a former friend of mine that had BPD.

3199
08:48:58,460 --> 08:49:05,460
And she blew her whole entire life up, which was sad to see.

3200
08:49:05,460 --> 08:49:15,460
It was really tough watching her blow up her life like that just for attention.

3201
08:49:15,460 --> 08:49:17,460
Because she wasn't getting the help that she needed.

3202
08:49:17,460 --> 08:49:18,460
She wasn't seeing anybody.

3203
08:49:18,460 --> 08:49:21,460
She wasn't seeing a specialist.

3204
08:49:21,460 --> 08:49:26,460
That's the type of thing you need to see someone for.

3205
08:49:26,460 --> 08:49:27,460
She didn't.

3206
08:49:27,460 --> 08:49:29,460
And she, you know, ruined a lot of friendships.

3207
08:49:29,460 --> 08:49:34,460
I had to disengage with her because I supported her on something.

3208
08:49:34,460 --> 08:49:38,460
Then, you know, it was all just for attention and it really sucked.

3209
08:49:38,460 --> 08:49:42,460
This was a deep issue.

3210
08:49:42,460 --> 08:49:46,460
But they are amazing people when treated.

3211
08:49:46,460 --> 08:49:50,460
When you're properly medicated, you're taking care of yourself.

3212
08:49:50,460 --> 08:49:54,460
That's so important.

3213
08:49:54,460 --> 08:49:55,460
I miss them truly.

3214
08:49:55,460 --> 08:50:03,460
And people, but also there's another thing of people who use their mental illness as an excuse for bad behavior.

3215
08:50:03,460 --> 08:50:07,460
I think I have like a, I took like a picture of a quote.

3216
08:50:07,460 --> 08:50:18,460
I forget how it goes, but it was just like, just, yes, it can contribute to it, but you can't.

3217
08:50:18,460 --> 08:50:21,460
Having a mental illness doesn't make you a shitty person.

3218
08:50:21,460 --> 08:50:26,460
That's how you handle it or something like that.

3219
08:50:26,460 --> 08:50:31,460
If I'm in here, pretend to have mental disabilities for pity points and Perky dealing with them gave me so much trust all the time.

3220
08:50:31,460 --> 08:50:33,460
Yeah, definitely.

3221
08:50:33,460 --> 08:50:34,460
True.

3222
08:50:34,460 --> 08:50:37,460
I get the sense that folks who self-diagnose these conditions just seek their feeling of importance through it.

3223
08:50:37,460 --> 08:50:44,460
It's also just like, it's a sense of belonging.

3224
08:50:44,460 --> 08:50:45,460
Excuse me.

3225
08:50:45,460 --> 08:50:50,460
It's a sense of belonging because you see it a lot on like social media.

3226
08:50:50,460 --> 08:50:53,460
People want to be a part of something.

3227
08:50:53,460 --> 08:50:55,460
Want to be proud of something.

3228
08:50:55,460 --> 08:50:56,460
They want to feel included.

3229
08:50:56,460 --> 08:50:57,460
They want to feel in a group.

3230
08:50:57,460 --> 08:51:00,460
There's nothing wrong with that.

3231
08:51:00,460 --> 08:51:11,460
But it might be the detriment of others that you proclaim that you're something that you're not just so you can feel like you need to fit into a more quirky label, which is unnecessary.

3232
08:51:11,460 --> 08:51:19,460
You know, especially with kids, kids feel like the kids are so pressured to feel like they have to fit in.

3233
08:51:19,460 --> 08:51:40,460
I know I like for one of my and also you just sometimes you do it just to be liked by like if you if you look up to someone or if you admire someone or you want to be friends with someone, you'll try to relate with them.

3234
08:51:40,460 --> 08:51:52,460
And so sometimes you might kind of try to adopt their personality traits or things that they, you know, struggle with so you can have that common ground.

3235
08:51:52,460 --> 08:51:54,460
I didn't find out I had ADHD until last year.

3236
08:51:54,460 --> 08:51:55,460
I explained a lot.

3237
08:51:55,460 --> 08:51:57,460
Yeah.

3238
08:51:57,460 --> 08:52:00,460
MPPD can be life ruining if you don't properly get help.

3239
08:52:00,460 --> 08:52:01,460
Truly sad.

3240
08:52:01,460 --> 08:52:02,460
Very true.

3241
08:52:02,460 --> 08:52:05,460
A lot of things can be a lot of things can be life ruining if not properly treated.

3242
08:52:05,460 --> 08:52:09,460
That's why it's so important to be on top of your mental health.

3243
08:52:09,460 --> 08:52:15,460
That's why, again, self-diagnosing is important in certain contexts.

3244
08:52:15,460 --> 08:52:19,460
If you think you're a danger to yourself or others, seek help.

3245
08:52:19,460 --> 08:52:21,460
100%.

3246
08:52:22,460 --> 08:52:29,460
Self-destructive behavior is always so sad, especially when you know how somebody is when they're not manic.

3247
08:52:29,460 --> 08:52:36,460
They're just kind of like balanced and they, you know, plateaued and normal, normal tempo or whatever.

3248
08:52:36,460 --> 08:52:41,460
Only people realize that simply asking for attention is not a bad thing.

3249
08:52:41,460 --> 08:52:43,460
That's true.

3250
08:52:43,460 --> 08:52:49,460
It's like it sucks though because there's always people that will like respond negatively to anything that you say.

3251
08:52:49,460 --> 08:52:54,460
Like I totally respect your opinion if you don't agree with me with anything I've just said for the past like two hours.

3252
08:52:54,460 --> 08:52:57,460
That's totally fine.

3253
08:52:57,460 --> 08:53:05,460
But then somebody might be like, hey, I would like some attention and someone would be like, oh, so you're just a fucking pick me or something.

3254
08:53:05,460 --> 08:53:07,460
Like I'm just giving an example.

3255
08:53:07,460 --> 08:53:12,460
So somebody that always like do that and that's where it gets tricky.

3256
08:53:12,460 --> 08:53:19,460
There's, oh, there's sometimes people are negative to be negative.

3257
08:53:19,460 --> 08:53:24,460
That's why trust and, you know, having your guard up is important some of the time.

3258
08:53:24,460 --> 08:53:33,460
You want to be careful, protect your feelings first and foremost, you know.

3259
08:53:33,460 --> 08:53:36,460
I just thought of the marina and the diamonds.

3260
08:53:36,460 --> 08:53:38,460
Fucking lyric.

3261
08:53:38,460 --> 08:53:40,460
Don't wear your heart on your sleeve.

3262
08:53:40,460 --> 08:53:42,460
Wear it on your cheek.

3263
08:53:42,460 --> 08:53:44,460
Look at the marina and the diamonds.

3264
08:53:48,460 --> 08:53:50,460
These are scenes for that goth emo punk.

3265
08:53:50,460 --> 08:53:55,460
Now it's I have DID, I have ADHD.

3266
08:53:55,460 --> 08:54:03,460
I am this form of this identity.

3267
08:54:03,460 --> 08:54:09,460
It's very interesting how people, that's such a, that actually just brought something to my attention.

3268
08:54:09,460 --> 08:54:18,460
It used to be like clicks in terms of, yeah, goth emo punk, jock, popular, nerdy, artistic, like it was that.

3269
08:54:18,460 --> 08:54:20,460
And now it's something else.

3270
08:54:20,460 --> 08:54:26,460
It's become more innate personality traits that you don't outwardly show your, it's your inside now.

3271
08:54:26,460 --> 08:54:27,460
That's so interesting to me.

3272
08:54:27,460 --> 08:54:31,460
I just realized that.

3273
08:54:31,460 --> 08:54:34,460
How, how now that's how groups are formed.

3274
08:54:34,460 --> 08:54:37,460
Because nobody cares anymore.

3275
08:54:37,460 --> 08:54:45,460
Like I'll see like, like my cousins, like my cousin, my little cousin, he plays soccer.

3276
08:54:45,460 --> 08:54:47,460
But he's also a big nerd.

3277
08:54:47,460 --> 08:54:49,460
He's also really good at academics.

3278
08:54:49,460 --> 08:54:53,460
He's less Pokemon.

3279
08:54:53,460 --> 08:54:56,460
Someone's car alarm is going off outside.

3280
08:54:56,460 --> 08:55:01,460
But he'll still hang out with like other nerdy kids or like the super, like, he'll sing out with the artistic kids.

3281
08:55:01,460 --> 08:55:03,460
Like that doesn't matter anymore.

3282
08:55:03,460 --> 08:55:05,460
Which is kind of cool.

3283
08:55:05,460 --> 08:55:11,460
Because now it's like, it's all chopped up to now you bond with people who have shared your same like headspace kind of thought process.

3284
08:55:11,460 --> 08:55:14,460
There's nothing wrong with that.

3285
08:55:14,460 --> 08:55:18,460
Everything can become a little easier when you stop and talk 100%.

3286
08:55:18,460 --> 08:55:20,460
Golf is just not a scene.

3287
08:55:20,460 --> 08:55:23,460
It's a lifestyle.

3288
08:55:23,460 --> 08:55:30,460
I feel like people aren't self diagnosing as all these things though, just certain internet circles 100%.

3289
08:55:30,460 --> 08:55:41,460
Yeah, it's not like, I don't see a people's life self diagnosing quirkly as BPD.

3290
08:55:41,460 --> 08:55:45,460
It's really, it's like, what, what is the fad?

3291
08:55:45,460 --> 08:55:49,460
And I would say, honestly, that's like, that's ADHD now.

3292
08:55:49,460 --> 08:55:53,460
That's why I'm wary to say if I have that or not, because I don't want to seem like that.

3293
08:55:53,460 --> 08:55:59,460
Because I don't know, I'm not officially diagnosed, you know, I'm not trying to do it to fit in with people.

3294
08:55:59,460 --> 08:56:06,460
I figure like, get the right medication so I can get shit done.

3295
08:56:06,460 --> 08:56:20,460
Because sometimes like for me, I only seek a diagnosis or I seek to understand a diagnosis or symptoms if I feel like it pertains to me.

3296
08:56:20,460 --> 08:56:26,460
Like, I personally feel like right now my medication isn't working in terms of my attention span.

3297
08:56:26,460 --> 08:56:30,460
I cannot focus sometimes, unless I'm really interested in something.

3298
08:56:30,460 --> 08:56:36,460
That's why I can stream for long periods of time because it's B2B is my special interest.

3299
08:56:36,460 --> 08:56:39,460
But if I have to do like housework, I'm procrastinating.

3300
08:56:39,460 --> 08:56:41,460
I'm also, I can't sleep because my mind keeps going.

3301
08:56:41,460 --> 08:56:43,460
It's going boom, boom, boom, boom.

3302
08:56:43,460 --> 08:56:46,460
I can't even, I'll be doing certain things.

3303
08:56:46,460 --> 08:56:47,460
Certain things bother me.

3304
08:56:47,460 --> 08:56:51,460
I have some sensory issues and I feel like I've never really noticed that before.

3305
08:56:51,460 --> 08:56:58,460
You know, my parents told me to get over it or that I'm being dramatic or something.

3306
08:56:58,460 --> 08:57:04,460
And that's, and then I'm like, oh, you know, maybe I need to look at my medication.

3307
08:57:04,460 --> 08:57:05,460
Maybe I need to look at my diagnosis.

3308
08:57:05,460 --> 08:57:12,460
Maybe I just, you know, misdiagnosis exists, you know.

3309
08:57:12,460 --> 08:57:16,460
Yeah.

3310
08:57:16,460 --> 08:57:17,460
Following this Elden Rings theory session.

3311
08:57:17,460 --> 08:57:18,460
Yeah, it's really interesting.

3312
08:57:18,460 --> 08:57:20,460
I always like talking about this sort of stuff.

3313
08:57:20,460 --> 08:57:28,460
I'm very, I love talking and thinking about how people work, how society works.

3314
08:57:28,460 --> 08:57:29,460
I also like philosophy.

3315
08:57:29,460 --> 08:57:35,460
So if you ever want to philosophize, is that a word?

3316
08:57:35,460 --> 08:57:42,460
I am down for that.

3317
08:57:42,460 --> 08:57:43,460
I'm never getting diagnosed.

3318
08:57:43,460 --> 08:57:46,460
I got to keep everybody guessing.

3319
08:57:46,460 --> 08:57:47,460
I think maybe that's how I want to be.

3320
08:57:47,460 --> 08:57:50,460
Maybe I want, I think I might follow your example.

3321
08:57:50,460 --> 08:57:53,460
Yeah, when you start to notice the thing when it's like, oh, I think I do have it.

3322
08:57:53,460 --> 08:57:55,460
Yeah, like, it was so funny.

3323
08:57:55,460 --> 08:58:02,460
You know that there's like that one, there is, so I was doing, when I was Rina, I think

3324
08:58:02,460 --> 08:58:05,460
I was doing like a slime ASMR or something.

3325
08:58:05,460 --> 08:58:08,460
I forget, like an actual slime ASMR.

3326
08:58:08,460 --> 08:58:16,460
Everybody calm down and someone was just like, I am literally on the autism spectrum and

3327
08:58:16,460 --> 08:58:19,460
I think you are higher up there than me or lower than me.

3328
08:58:19,460 --> 08:58:20,460
And I'm like, what?

3329
08:58:20,460 --> 08:58:21,460
You're kidding.

3330
08:58:21,460 --> 08:58:23,460
And they're like, go ahead, take a test online.

3331
08:58:23,460 --> 08:58:26,460
I'm like, what actual fucking test is there online?

3332
08:58:26,460 --> 08:58:31,460
I don't believe any of that bullshit online test taking.

3333
08:58:31,460 --> 08:58:36,460
There is a test they use as a guideline I discovered from this person that was in my chat.

3334
08:58:36,460 --> 08:58:40,460
It's called the RADS or the RAS, I don't know, RADS test.

3335
08:58:40,460 --> 08:58:48,460
I took it, I scored like 120, which is high indications of autism.

3336
08:58:48,460 --> 08:58:51,460
Well, not high, more like medium indications.

3337
08:58:51,460 --> 08:58:52,460
That kind of made me wonder.

3338
08:58:52,460 --> 08:58:58,460
I'm just like, okay, should I be looking into this now?

3339
08:58:58,460 --> 08:59:04,460
Because I'm realizing that I do do things a little bit weirdly, not weirdly.

3340
08:59:04,460 --> 08:59:09,460
Actually, I'll take that back a little differently with other people.

3341
08:59:10,460 --> 08:59:11,460
120 plus plus.

3342
08:59:11,460 --> 08:59:13,460
I think it was out of 240.

3343
08:59:13,460 --> 08:59:15,460
So I was like, I was in the middle of the road.

3344
08:59:15,460 --> 08:59:16,460
It was bad.

3345
08:59:16,460 --> 08:59:17,460
It was funny.

3346
08:59:17,460 --> 08:59:21,460
I got my coworkers to do a network because I'm like, hey, let's try it.

3347
08:59:21,460 --> 08:59:27,460
And then this one dude scored super high and he's like normally very quiet.

3348
08:59:27,460 --> 08:59:29,460
And he really likes music.

3349
08:59:29,460 --> 08:59:33,460
He doesn't really talk to a lot of people in my impulsive ass.

3350
08:59:33,460 --> 08:59:36,460
He scored like, I think like 240.

3351
08:59:36,460 --> 08:59:42,460
I just went, oh, that explains a lot in my, in my, in Salem cause she, cause I used to

3352
08:59:42,460 --> 08:59:43,460
work with her.

3353
08:59:43,460 --> 08:59:44,460
She's my one of my best friends.

3354
08:59:44,460 --> 08:59:49,460
She's fucking like hit me in the arm so hard and gave me such a look.

3355
08:59:49,460 --> 08:59:50,460
I'm like, I'm sorry.

3356
08:59:50,460 --> 08:59:53,460
I didn't mean to say that out loud.

3357
08:59:53,460 --> 08:59:54,460
Yeah, exactly.

3358
08:59:54,460 --> 08:59:56,460
They share a lot of traits and symptoms.

3359
08:59:56,460 --> 08:59:58,460
That's why I'm like, okay, maybe I should look at that.

3360
08:59:58,460 --> 09:00:00,460
Maybe I should look at that.

3361
09:00:00,460 --> 09:00:04,460
And then I'm even telling my dad to look at it.

3362
09:00:04,460 --> 09:00:06,460
Cause again, me and my dad are like, I'm a clone of my father.

3363
09:00:06,460 --> 09:00:12,460
I just have boobs and I'm not bald cause my dad is bald dude.

3364
09:00:12,460 --> 09:00:14,460
And I'm like, dad, I think you should consider this too.

3365
09:00:14,460 --> 09:00:23,460
Cause we both have like, I know my dad is learning a lot about his mental health through me cause we are so similar.

3366
09:00:23,460 --> 09:00:31,460
In terms of like, he is realizing he also has really bad things with change and adjustment.

3367
09:00:31,460 --> 09:00:36,460
And that we both like are very childlike sometimes like in goofy.

3368
09:00:36,460 --> 09:00:38,460
My mom was like, my mom always complains.

3369
09:00:38,460 --> 09:00:43,460
Sometimes she's just like, sometimes even your dad would argue like your brother and sister.

3370
09:00:43,460 --> 09:00:46,460
Cause my dad would just be a goofy.

3371
09:00:46,460 --> 09:00:48,460
And I love him for that.

3372
09:00:48,460 --> 09:00:50,460
He's a great dad.

3373
09:00:50,460 --> 09:00:51,460
I said was like he's dead.

3374
09:00:51,460 --> 09:00:53,460
He is a great dad.

3375
09:00:53,460 --> 09:01:00,460
My mom's awesome too for putting up with our bullshit.

3376
09:01:00,460 --> 09:01:04,460
Um, yeah, diagnosed or not, people always compare me to forest comp.

3377
09:01:04,460 --> 09:01:06,460
I didn't know what they meant until I watched it.

3378
09:01:06,460 --> 09:01:11,460
Oh, but he's such a sweetheart though.

3379
09:01:11,460 --> 09:01:13,460
Such a sweetheart.

3380
09:01:13,460 --> 09:01:14,460
I'm so thankful.

3381
09:01:14,460 --> 09:01:17,460
So like, again, I, like I mentioned, I worked in human services.

3382
09:01:17,460 --> 09:01:20,460
Um, did that for six years.

3383
09:01:20,460 --> 09:01:27,460
And I've also had been growing up around like the disabled population for a long time because my dad worked in the industry.

3384
09:01:27,460 --> 09:01:38,460
And so like one of my best friends growing up was literally a woman who was at her time at the time was I believe in her late.

3385
09:01:38,460 --> 09:01:39,460
No, not really.

3386
09:01:39,460 --> 09:01:40,460
Yeah.

3387
09:01:40,460 --> 09:01:41,460
Her late twenties.

3388
09:01:41,460 --> 09:01:45,460
She had the mentality of like a 13 year old that we would hang out all the time.

3389
09:01:45,460 --> 09:01:47,460
It was great.

3390
09:01:47,460 --> 09:01:49,460
And it just normalized it for me.

3391
09:01:49,460 --> 09:01:53,460
Like that, you know, people have different stuff going on.

3392
09:01:53,460 --> 09:01:56,460
And like there are people like, again, I told you, like I worked with somebody that gets schizophrenia.

3393
09:01:56,460 --> 09:02:00,460
She was there at the time too, because I worked at the same place my dad did.

3394
09:02:00,460 --> 09:02:08,460
And there are folks who had like, you know, different behavioral issues, autism, Down syndrome.

3395
09:02:08,460 --> 09:02:11,460
And so kind of just normalized it for me.

3396
09:02:11,460 --> 09:02:17,460
And I was kind of just like under more understanding and I'm very thankful for that.

3397
09:02:17,460 --> 09:02:19,460
Very thankful for that.

3398
09:02:19,460 --> 09:02:24,460
Because I know some people don't know how to act around that population.

3399
09:02:24,460 --> 09:02:30,460
You know, they're, you know, they're just like, you know, experiencing a little bit differently.

3400
09:02:30,460 --> 09:02:33,460
Ow.

3401
09:02:37,460 --> 09:02:39,460
You guys saw that.

3402
09:02:39,460 --> 09:02:43,460
You guys saw I jumped out of the way and it still grabbed me anyways.

3403
09:02:43,460 --> 09:02:46,460
That's so funny.

3404
09:02:46,460 --> 09:02:50,460
How the fuck did that clip through them?

3405
09:02:50,460 --> 09:02:52,460
These are unique in their own ways.

3406
09:02:52,460 --> 09:02:54,460
Anyone to understand that? Exactly.

3407
09:02:54,460 --> 09:02:59,460
That's why I'm a very kind of open-minded and accepting person.

3408
09:02:59,460 --> 09:03:01,460
Yeah.

3409
09:03:01,460 --> 09:03:02,460
They're cheating. They are cheating.

3410
09:03:02,460 --> 09:03:04,460
I swear to God, they're cheating.

3411
09:03:04,460 --> 09:03:05,460
They have hacks.

3412
09:03:05,460 --> 09:03:07,460
They're clipping through shit.

3413
09:03:07,460 --> 09:03:12,460
One of them is wall hacks.

3414
09:03:13,460 --> 09:03:16,460
Oh, well, I'm just gonna die then.

3415
09:03:16,460 --> 09:03:18,460
I'll kill you.

3416
09:03:27,460 --> 09:03:31,460
Yes, after working with a lot of people with different mental disabilities and afflictions,

3417
09:03:31,460 --> 09:03:33,460
I think it really makes you approach people and consider them differently.

3418
09:03:33,460 --> 09:03:36,460
Of course, especially. Yeah.

3419
09:03:39,460 --> 09:03:40,460
I loved working there.

3420
09:03:40,460 --> 09:03:42,460
Again, it was very taxing.

3421
09:03:42,460 --> 09:03:47,460
I mostly left because a lot of my folks, a lot of the folks I worked with,

3422
09:03:47,460 --> 09:03:51,460
the clients I supported, they were older.

3423
09:03:51,460 --> 09:03:53,460
They were institutionalized when they were younger.

3424
09:03:53,460 --> 09:04:00,460
So they were, if you have any idea what institutions were like in like the 70s and 60s and 50s,

3425
09:04:00,460 --> 09:04:02,460
they were a mess.

3426
09:04:02,460 --> 09:04:04,460
Dude.

3427
09:04:04,460 --> 09:04:06,460
And it's kind of helping them through what they went through.

3428
09:04:06,460 --> 09:04:08,460
It's pretty hard.

3429
09:04:08,460 --> 09:04:13,460
And then another thing was they were older.

3430
09:04:13,460 --> 09:04:14,460
So they're passing away.

3431
09:04:14,460 --> 09:04:16,460
So it was really hard because I had grown up with a lot of them.

3432
09:04:16,460 --> 09:04:18,460
My dad would take me to work with them.

3433
09:04:18,460 --> 09:04:21,460
I would like sit in color while he helped them out just like,

3434
09:04:21,460 --> 09:04:24,460
because it was an art therapy place as well.

3435
09:04:24,460 --> 09:04:25,460
That was art therapy.

3436
09:04:25,460 --> 09:04:28,460
That's also where I love to draw.

3437
09:04:28,460 --> 09:04:30,460
My dad used to trick and joke with me.

3438
09:04:30,460 --> 09:04:36,460
He's just like, oh, you thought you were, you thought you were helping them out.

3439
09:04:36,460 --> 09:04:40,460
The clients, you were one of them.

3440
09:04:40,460 --> 09:04:49,460
I was like, my dad was like gaslighting me to think I was disabled for the longest fucking time.

3441
09:04:49,460 --> 09:04:51,460
I was fucking.

3442
09:04:51,460 --> 09:04:53,460
My mom was so mad.

3443
09:04:53,460 --> 09:05:00,460
She's like, why are you talking to that?

3444
09:05:00,460 --> 09:05:13,460
Yeah, no, I was, it was, it was tough seeing the people that I had grown up knowing pass away.

3445
09:05:13,460 --> 09:05:19,460
But it was really also nice to kind of give back and take care of them.

3446
09:05:19,460 --> 09:05:23,460
He literally shot her island me.

3447
09:05:23,460 --> 09:05:24,460
Streaming is my therapy.

3448
09:05:24,460 --> 09:05:25,460
It really is.

3449
09:05:25,460 --> 09:05:29,460
Again, I guess just get to talk.

3450
09:05:29,460 --> 09:05:30,460
Streaming is very good.

3451
09:05:30,460 --> 09:05:33,460
Again, my therapist was on vacation.

3452
09:05:33,460 --> 09:05:38,460
So it was tough not being able to talk to her when Fia has been, not Fia.

3453
09:05:38,460 --> 09:05:44,460
Reina has been, I'm so used to Fia being sick that Reina is sick now.

3454
09:05:44,460 --> 09:05:53,460
I'm so used to talking to her about like what's going on with like my cats and stuff kind of sucks when she was around.

3455
09:05:53,460 --> 09:05:55,460
But you know, everybody needs a fucking vacation.

3456
09:05:55,460 --> 09:05:56,460
Are you kidding me?

3457
09:05:56,460 --> 09:05:59,460
I heard people multiple yapp all the time about how much they hate their lives.

3458
09:05:59,460 --> 09:06:03,460
Jesus Christ.

3459
09:06:03,460 --> 09:06:05,460
And I know.

3460
09:06:05,460 --> 09:06:14,460
And one of my friends, I recommended to her and we obviously there's like client confidentiality.

3461
09:06:14,460 --> 09:06:19,460
She doesn't tell my therapist is telling my friend talks to her about, but I talked to my friend, obviously.

3462
09:06:19,460 --> 09:06:25,460
And I'm like, damn, if I had to be her therapist, oh my God.

3463
09:06:26,460 --> 09:06:28,460
That can be hard.

3464
09:06:28,460 --> 09:06:32,460
My grandmother passed away from brain cancer the other year and you're really, but I'm so sorry about that.

3465
09:06:32,460 --> 09:06:36,460
That's very hard.

3466
09:06:36,460 --> 09:06:38,460
Loss is extremely difficult.

3467
09:06:38,460 --> 09:06:40,460
Very extremely difficult.

3468
09:06:40,460 --> 09:06:42,460
I'll be honest with you.

3469
09:06:42,460 --> 09:06:45,460
I haven't experienced knock on wood.

3470
09:06:45,460 --> 09:06:48,460
Watch my like grandfather die like three days or something.

3471
09:06:48,460 --> 09:06:51,460
I haven't experienced a lot of like immediate family loss.

3472
09:06:51,460 --> 09:06:57,460
Although my I'm actually my great grandmother passed away.

3473
09:06:57,460 --> 09:06:59,460
Literally a couple of weeks ago.

3474
09:06:59,460 --> 09:07:08,460
That was tough, but it was tough because I it was hard seeing my mom really worked up about it because she was super close to my great grandmother.

3475
09:07:08,460 --> 09:07:10,460
But I haven't experienced a lot of loss.

3476
09:07:10,460 --> 09:07:18,460
And so I always admire how people are strong people are people are so strong.

3477
09:07:18,460 --> 09:07:20,460
So strong after those things.

3478
09:07:20,460 --> 09:07:22,460
And sometimes they're not and that's okay.

3479
09:07:22,460 --> 09:07:24,460
That's why there's other people there to lift them up.

3480
09:07:24,460 --> 09:07:30,460
That's why it's important to have a support system so that you don't feel alone in the situations.

3481
09:07:34,460 --> 09:07:36,460
Oh, baby.

3482
09:07:38,460 --> 09:07:40,460
I don't know why I ran in here.

3483
09:07:40,460 --> 09:07:52,460
Yeah, everybody I'm gonna I'm gonna recommend a book to you.

3484
09:07:52,460 --> 09:07:54,460
This is my favorite book.

3485
09:07:54,460 --> 09:07:56,460
One of my favorite books.

3486
09:07:59,460 --> 09:08:01,460
Where is it? Where did I put it?

3487
09:08:02,460 --> 09:08:10,460
I'm very nervous because I'm wondering if I gave it to someone to borrow and they never gave it back from work.

3488
09:08:10,460 --> 09:08:13,460
And I will hunt that person the fuck down.

3489
09:08:18,460 --> 09:08:20,460
My mom wrote something for me.

3490
09:08:20,460 --> 09:08:22,460
It's very important to me.

3491
09:08:31,460 --> 09:08:57,460
I'll read you what my mom said.

3492
09:08:57,460 --> 09:08:59,460
So

3493
09:09:07,460 --> 09:09:09,460
Now maybe I'll do like a

3494
09:09:09,460 --> 09:09:14,460
I'll do a stream where I read this to you because I although I start I'll start fucking crying.

3495
09:09:18,460 --> 09:09:24,460
But it's called and this is also like an Apple TV movie that they made into a movie.

3496
09:09:24,460 --> 09:09:27,460
It's called the boy the mole the fox and the horse.

3497
09:09:32,460 --> 09:09:34,460
What are you doing?

3498
09:09:34,460 --> 09:09:36,460
And it's full of really sweet quotes.

3499
09:09:36,460 --> 09:09:39,460
It's by Charlie Mackenzie or Mackenzie.

3500
09:09:41,460 --> 09:09:43,460
Very beautifully illustrated.

3501
09:09:43,460 --> 09:09:47,460
It's very unique like sketchy painted watercolor art style.

3502
09:09:47,460 --> 09:09:50,460
You can just Google it and you can see some of the quotes in there.

3503
09:09:51,460 --> 09:09:52,460
They're very reassuring.

3504
09:09:52,460 --> 09:09:55,460
Anytime I'm feeling very, very down.

3505
09:09:55,460 --> 09:09:56,460
I'm late.

3506
09:09:56,460 --> 09:09:58,460
My voice is shaking because I love this book so much.

3507
09:09:58,460 --> 09:10:02,460
And every time I open to a page, I want to cry.

3508
09:10:02,460 --> 09:10:03,460
Oh yeah.

3509
09:10:03,460 --> 09:10:04,460
My mom dated it.

3510
09:10:04,460 --> 09:10:06,460
It was March 2021.

3511
09:10:06,460 --> 09:10:07,460
I don't know.

3512
09:10:07,460 --> 09:10:11,460
I think it was during COVID and I think I was just having a tough time with the isolation.

3513
09:10:11,460 --> 09:10:19,460
I've literally bent so many corners in this book pages because there's so many good quotes.

3514
09:10:19,460 --> 09:10:21,460
There's so many good quotes in here.

3515
09:10:21,460 --> 09:10:23,460
But I highly recommend it.

3516
09:10:23,460 --> 09:10:24,460
A member stream.

3517
09:10:24,460 --> 09:10:25,460
Maybe.

3518
09:10:25,460 --> 09:10:26,460
Maybe.

3519
09:10:33,460 --> 09:10:34,460
I'm sorry.

3520
09:10:34,460 --> 09:10:38,460
I just read about my mom row and I'm trying not to.

3521
09:10:38,460 --> 09:10:41,460
I'm actually fine, but I'm trying not to get worked up.

3522
09:10:41,460 --> 09:10:42,460
Okay.

3523
09:10:42,460 --> 09:10:48,460
For redacted for she be the mole is very wise.

3524
09:10:48,460 --> 09:10:54,460
I folded over corners of this book, which I hope you read from time to time when you're happy, when you're sad, when you feel alone.

3525
09:10:54,460 --> 09:10:58,460
Remember, love always brings you home and I love you always, mom.

3526
09:11:02,460 --> 09:11:04,460
So anytime I'm sad, I read that.

3527
09:11:11,460 --> 09:11:13,460
I highly recommend the book.

3528
09:11:13,460 --> 09:11:14,460
So sweet.

3529
09:11:14,460 --> 09:11:15,460
My mom is very sweet.

3530
09:11:18,460 --> 09:11:23,460
And maybe we'll watch it together for a watch along.

3531
09:11:23,460 --> 09:11:24,460
That'd be cute.

3532
09:11:24,460 --> 09:11:26,460
No, I'll just be crying the entire time.

3533
09:11:26,460 --> 09:11:27,460
I can't do that.

3534
09:11:27,460 --> 09:11:28,460
Like that.

3535
09:11:28,460 --> 09:11:33,460
Literally that book and that movie give me a Pavlovian response where I literally cry.

3536
09:11:33,460 --> 09:11:38,460
Like I'm tearing up right now and I'm okay, but I'm literally tearing up.

3537
09:11:38,460 --> 09:11:43,460
I'm looking at my mup itself with the American flag next to me.

3538
09:11:43,460 --> 09:11:44,460
I'm dead.

3539
09:11:44,460 --> 09:11:45,460
I'm dead.

3540
09:11:45,460 --> 09:11:46,460
I'm dead.

3541
09:11:46,460 --> 09:11:47,460
I'm dead.

3542
09:11:47,460 --> 09:11:48,460
I'm your dad too.

3543
09:11:48,460 --> 09:11:49,460
Call me daddy.

3544
09:11:49,460 --> 09:11:50,460
Who's your daddy?

3545
09:11:50,460 --> 09:11:51,460
Who's your daddy?

3546
09:11:51,460 --> 09:11:55,460
Actually, I need to think of what to do for a member stream next week.

3547
09:11:59,460 --> 09:12:02,460
Okay, let me, I'm done with this for now because that's pissing me off.

3548
09:12:02,460 --> 09:12:03,460
I'll do this.

3549
09:12:03,460 --> 09:12:06,460
I'm probably going to play this tomorrow by myself.

3550
09:12:11,460 --> 09:12:14,460
I will probably play a lot of this off stream.

3551
09:12:14,460 --> 09:12:16,460
So you might, I might be redone off stream.

3552
09:12:16,460 --> 09:12:20,460
I don't know because I'm not going to be able to wait and want to get to the DLC as soon

3553
09:12:20,460 --> 09:12:23,460
as fucking possible.

3554
09:12:23,460 --> 09:12:24,460
Crying the whole time would just be average.

3555
09:12:24,460 --> 09:12:25,460
So I need to watch along.

3556
09:12:25,460 --> 09:12:26,460
Porfin cries over there.

3557
09:12:26,460 --> 09:12:27,460
Yeah.

3558
09:12:27,460 --> 09:12:28,460
Wasn't she crying?

3559
09:12:28,460 --> 09:12:29,460
I like, oh no.

3560
09:12:29,460 --> 09:12:30,460
That's Sarah.

3561
09:12:30,460 --> 09:12:35,460
That's Sarah was reading me when I was about to end.

3562
09:12:35,460 --> 09:12:41,460
I can chat a little bit longer.

3563
09:12:41,460 --> 09:12:42,460
Crying, watch along.

3564
09:12:42,460 --> 09:12:49,460
Let me turn this fucking music down.

3565
09:12:49,460 --> 09:12:51,460
Is that a Muppet?

3566
09:12:51,460 --> 09:12:52,460
Yeah.

3567
09:12:52,460 --> 09:12:55,460
You got a problem with this Muppet?

3568
09:12:55,460 --> 09:12:58,460
You want to shmup it with this Muppet?

3569
09:12:58,460 --> 09:12:59,460
Welcome Raiders.

3570
09:12:59,460 --> 09:13:01,460
Chania Breakdown here at the end of John Wick 4.

3571
09:13:01,460 --> 09:13:05,460
I don't know why she was crying at John Wick besides the first movie.

3572
09:13:05,460 --> 09:13:06,460
I get it.

3573
09:13:06,460 --> 09:13:07,460
I cried during the first movie.

3574
09:13:07,460 --> 09:13:10,460
But why was she crying during the other movies?

3575
09:13:10,460 --> 09:13:13,460
I can't remember what happened at the end of 4.

3576
09:13:13,460 --> 09:13:15,460
4 wasn't Parabellum, was it?

3577
09:13:15,460 --> 09:13:21,460
It was, that's, she cried so much.

3578
09:13:21,460 --> 09:13:24,460
Chania's an emotional person.

3579
09:13:24,460 --> 09:13:25,460
Welcome Raiders.

3580
09:13:25,460 --> 09:13:26,460
Hello, Sarah.

3581
09:13:26,460 --> 09:13:28,460
I want to shmup it with the Muppet.

3582
09:13:28,460 --> 09:13:29,460
Of course you do.

3583
09:13:29,460 --> 09:13:32,460
You can shmup it with this Muppet anytime.

3584
09:13:32,460 --> 09:13:35,460
Anytime, Sarah.

3585
09:13:35,460 --> 09:13:42,460
Mercy pulled a U today and came into the call and was being really funny.

3586
09:13:42,460 --> 09:13:47,460
She scared the crap out of me with a little Atomaton.

3587
09:13:47,460 --> 09:13:48,460
Atomaton?

3588
09:13:48,460 --> 09:13:49,460
Atomaton?

3589
09:13:49,460 --> 09:13:50,460
Atomaton?

3590
09:13:50,460 --> 09:13:51,460
Pull up.

3591
09:13:51,460 --> 09:13:52,460
YouTube studio.

3592
09:13:52,460 --> 09:13:53,460
We're just going to gap.

3593
09:13:53,460 --> 09:13:54,460
We're just gaping.

3594
09:13:54,460 --> 09:13:55,460
We're just hanging out.

3595
09:13:55,460 --> 09:13:56,460
Oh my God.

3596
09:13:56,460 --> 09:13:57,460
The screen's so bright.

3597
09:13:57,460 --> 09:13:58,460
Oh, I hate it.

3598
09:13:58,460 --> 09:13:59,460
There we go.

3599
09:13:59,460 --> 09:14:00,460
Now it's better.

3600
09:14:00,460 --> 09:14:01,460
Sorry, I'm asleep.

3601
09:14:01,460 --> 09:14:02,460
Sorry, I'm not asleep.

3602
09:14:02,460 --> 09:14:03,460
Hello.

3603
09:14:03,460 --> 09:14:04,460
Okay.

3604
09:14:04,460 --> 09:14:08,460
It's so weird seeing my model after a while.

3605
09:14:08,460 --> 09:14:09,460
Whoa.

3606
09:14:09,460 --> 09:14:10,460
Excuse me.

3607
09:14:10,460 --> 09:14:11,460
Your progress today?

3608
09:14:11,460 --> 09:14:12,460
It's time to say goodnight.

3609
09:14:12,460 --> 09:14:13,460
Good night.

3610
09:14:13,460 --> 09:14:14,460
Good night.

3611
09:14:14,460 --> 09:14:15,460
Good night.

3612
09:14:15,460 --> 09:14:16,460
Good night.

3613
09:14:16,460 --> 09:14:17,460
Good night.

3614
09:14:17,460 --> 09:14:18,460
Good night.

3615
09:14:18,460 --> 09:14:19,460
Good night.

3616
09:14:19,460 --> 09:14:20,460
Good night.

3617
09:14:20,460 --> 09:14:21,460
Good night.

3618
09:14:21,460 --> 09:14:22,460
Good night.

3619
09:14:22,460 --> 09:14:23,460
Excuse me.

3620
09:14:23,460 --> 09:14:24,460
Your progress today?

3621
09:14:24,460 --> 09:14:25,460
It's time to say goodnight.

3622
09:14:25,460 --> 09:14:26,460
Thank you.

3623
09:14:26,460 --> 09:14:27,460
Thank you for coming by.

3624
09:14:27,460 --> 09:14:28,460
There she is.

3625
09:14:28,460 --> 09:14:29,460
Oh, she be.

3626
09:14:29,460 --> 09:14:30,460
Yeah.

3627
09:14:30,460 --> 09:14:39,460
I can, um, I can, hold on.

3628
09:14:39,460 --> 09:14:48,460
I can hold it up like I am controlling the Muppet.

3629
09:14:48,460 --> 09:14:49,460
I'm up.

3630
09:14:49,460 --> 09:14:54,460
It's actually controlling me if anything, just to, just to say.

3631
09:14:54,460 --> 09:14:58,460
I'm trying to make this look as realistic as possible.

3632
09:14:58,460 --> 09:15:00,460
Also cover my boobies.

3633
09:15:00,460 --> 09:15:05,460
Now I look at the Muppet when you talk.

3634
09:15:05,460 --> 09:15:06,460
All right.

3635
09:15:06,460 --> 09:15:08,460
I'm taking them up on off.

3636
09:15:08,460 --> 09:15:09,460
I forgot.

3637
09:15:09,460 --> 09:15:12,460
I need to send PNGs to people that I'm collabing with.

3638
09:15:12,460 --> 09:15:13,460
All right.

3639
09:15:13,460 --> 09:15:15,460
I'm gonna take some pictures real quick.

3640
09:15:15,460 --> 09:15:16,460
Don't, don't mind me.

3641
09:15:16,460 --> 09:15:19,460
I'm just going to take some pictures.

3642
09:15:19,460 --> 09:15:31,460
Which one is that one?

3643
09:15:31,460 --> 09:15:33,460
Perfect.

3644
09:15:33,460 --> 09:15:35,460
Taking selfies.

3645
09:15:35,460 --> 09:15:38,460
What a terrible day to be a Muppet fan.

3646
09:15:38,460 --> 09:15:40,460
Silly or menacing.

3647
09:15:40,460 --> 09:15:41,460
Okay.

3648
09:15:41,460 --> 09:15:45,460
I can be, I can be silly menacing.

3649
09:15:45,460 --> 09:15:56,460
How do I, this looks terrifying.

3650
09:15:56,460 --> 09:16:04,460
Do I look silly and menacing to you?

3651
09:16:04,460 --> 09:16:06,460
I don't like that.

3652
09:16:06,460 --> 09:16:11,460
Let me take this off.

3653
09:16:11,460 --> 09:16:14,460
It's what, it was so funny.

3654
09:16:14,460 --> 09:16:20,460
There, these were like, I think these were like bonus expressions that like the artists

3655
09:16:20,460 --> 09:16:21,460
just like left.

3656
09:16:21,460 --> 09:16:23,460
And then every group is going through.

3657
09:16:23,460 --> 09:16:28,460
She's like, why does everybody have this face?

3658
09:16:28,460 --> 09:16:32,460
That means all of us have this goofy face.

3659
09:16:32,460 --> 09:16:34,460
What the fuck?

3660
09:16:34,460 --> 09:16:36,460
I accidentally winked.

3661
09:16:36,460 --> 09:16:39,460
I was like, what the fuck?

3662
09:16:39,460 --> 09:16:42,460
I was like, what the fuck?

3663
09:16:42,460 --> 09:16:45,460
I was like, what the fuck?

3664
09:16:45,460 --> 09:16:48,460
I was like, what the fuck?

3665
09:16:48,460 --> 09:16:58,460
I accidentally winked.

3666
09:16:58,460 --> 09:17:01,460
That's better.

3667
09:17:01,460 --> 09:17:15,460
Let me do a normal face.

3668
09:17:15,460 --> 09:17:17,460
Oh, guys, it's so hard being a VTuber.

3669
09:17:17,460 --> 09:17:30,460
I have to take selfies.

3670
09:17:30,460 --> 09:17:34,460
Lippies aren't closing.

3671
09:17:34,460 --> 09:17:39,460
Sometimes VTube Studio think my lips are like how my mouth is open.

3672
09:17:39,460 --> 09:17:46,460
So like my mouth is closed right now, ready?

3673
09:17:46,460 --> 09:17:53,460
And it thinks my mouth is open.

3674
09:17:53,460 --> 09:17:58,460
She really said, oh.

3675
09:17:58,460 --> 09:18:00,460
Can't wait for Tan to talk a little bit.

3676
09:18:00,460 --> 09:18:01,460
I know, me too.

3677
09:18:01,460 --> 09:18:03,460
I can't wait.

3678
09:18:03,460 --> 09:18:09,460
I think I'll feel even more like myself than them, Tan.

3679
09:18:09,460 --> 09:18:11,460
You're so beautiful.

3680
09:18:11,460 --> 09:18:12,460
Thank you.

3681
09:18:12,460 --> 09:18:13,460
Sheepie's lips.

3682
09:18:13,460 --> 09:18:15,460
Which lips were I talking about?

3683
09:18:15,460 --> 09:18:16,460
Were I talking?

3684
09:18:16,460 --> 09:18:20,460
Fuck, never mind.

3685
09:18:20,460 --> 09:18:25,460
I'm getting overtired again.

3686
09:18:25,460 --> 09:18:29,460
I feel like I want to take one more picture.

3687
09:18:29,460 --> 09:18:30,460
I want to selfie.

3688
09:18:30,460 --> 09:18:43,460
I'll do one with my cute mouth.

3689
09:18:43,460 --> 09:18:57,460
Maybe I should look the other way.

3690
09:18:57,460 --> 09:18:58,460
Cool.

3691
09:18:58,460 --> 09:19:04,460
It's always good to have a lot of PNGs on hand, you know?

3692
09:19:04,460 --> 09:19:11,460
Always good.

3693
09:19:11,460 --> 09:19:12,460
Maybe the ropes are back.

3694
09:19:12,460 --> 09:19:13,460
You need to go back.

3695
09:19:13,460 --> 09:19:14,460
I know I'm restraining myself.

3696
09:19:14,460 --> 09:19:15,460
I'm calm.

3697
09:19:15,460 --> 09:19:25,460
Let me throw in some music.

3698
09:19:25,460 --> 09:19:28,460
I'm going to my bedroom.

3699
09:19:28,460 --> 09:19:41,460
We're going to my bedroom.

3700
09:19:41,460 --> 09:19:42,460
I know that's too fucking loud.

3701
09:19:42,460 --> 09:19:44,460
I don't know why.

3702
09:19:44,460 --> 09:19:45,460
Okay.

3703
09:19:45,460 --> 09:19:46,460
Oh.

3704
09:19:46,460 --> 09:19:48,460
I should just put a Muppet.

3705
09:19:48,460 --> 09:19:51,460
I should just send people who are asking for a PNG.

3706
09:19:51,460 --> 09:19:56,460
You just my Muppet self.

3707
09:19:56,460 --> 09:19:59,460
That would be terrifying.

3708
09:19:59,460 --> 09:20:08,460
I can't even see the one who they picked.

3709
09:20:08,460 --> 09:20:18,460
There we go.

3710
09:20:18,460 --> 09:20:40,460
That's a lot of multiple.

3711
09:20:40,460 --> 09:20:56,460
I'm going to tell you so huge.

3712
09:20:56,460 --> 09:21:05,460
I should have asked mommy to get me a thing where I can put my hands on my hips.

3713
09:21:05,460 --> 09:21:10,460
I think that would be, and I can just power stance.

3714
09:21:10,460 --> 09:21:11,460
Oh, hi, Tomo.

3715
09:21:11,460 --> 09:21:12,460
Did you win?

3716
09:21:12,460 --> 09:21:15,460
I was really about to look at your DMs.

3717
09:21:15,460 --> 09:21:25,460
What is this?

3718
09:21:25,460 --> 09:21:52,460
I'm secretly responding to Tomo.

3719
09:21:52,460 --> 09:21:57,460
Tomo's cooking, by the way.

3720
09:21:57,460 --> 09:21:59,460
You guys have no idea what she's cooking.

3721
09:21:59,460 --> 09:22:01,460
She also sends me a TikTok that I can't watch right now.

3722
09:22:01,460 --> 09:22:03,460
Wait, can I watch it right now?

3723
09:22:03,460 --> 09:22:21,460
Can I watch this to cut?

3724
09:22:21,460 --> 09:22:23,460
Oh, my God, me.

3725
09:22:51,460 --> 09:22:58,460
Oh, my God, they're so African.

3726
09:22:58,460 --> 09:22:59,460
I love it so much.

3727
09:22:59,460 --> 09:23:18,460
They just remind me of my aunties.

3728
09:23:18,460 --> 09:23:25,460
I don't know if you guys can hear that, but it was funny.

3729
09:23:25,460 --> 09:23:28,460
It was very funny.

3730
09:23:28,460 --> 09:23:31,460
Can't wait to see it's cursed.

3731
09:23:31,460 --> 09:23:40,460
My free page is built brick by brick for my friends.

3732
09:23:40,460 --> 09:23:46,460
All right, well, I guess I'll read mercy.

3733
09:23:46,460 --> 09:23:52,460
Let me see.

3734
09:23:52,460 --> 09:24:04,460
Oh, holy crap.

3735
09:24:04,460 --> 09:24:09,460
Where?

3736
09:24:09,460 --> 09:24:14,460
I can't find YouTube, please.

3737
09:24:14,460 --> 09:24:15,460
Where am I?

3738
09:24:15,460 --> 09:24:17,460
Oh, it's under this.

3739
09:24:17,460 --> 09:24:22,460
Oh, bad.

3740
09:24:22,460 --> 09:24:34,460
Oh, Aimee's opening memberships.

3741
09:24:34,460 --> 09:24:39,460
Well, when I said I would already read mercy, but I want to read Aimee.

3742
09:24:39,460 --> 09:24:40,460
Oh, no.

3743
09:24:40,460 --> 09:24:44,460
I could not drum off so many friends streaming.

3744
09:24:44,460 --> 09:24:49,460
What do I do?

3745
09:24:49,460 --> 09:24:53,460
I love Aimee, but I love mercy too.

3746
09:24:53,460 --> 09:25:05,460
I wish I could split a raid.

3747
09:25:05,460 --> 09:25:09,460
Well, I told Mercy I would read her something.

3748
09:25:09,460 --> 09:25:12,460
But go see Aimee as well.

3749
09:25:12,460 --> 09:25:14,460
She's opening memberships.

3750
09:25:14,460 --> 09:25:16,460
I love her.

3751
09:25:16,460 --> 09:25:17,460
She's so sweet.

3752
09:25:17,460 --> 09:25:26,460
We were talking today because we're going to do a collab soon with some other girlies.

3753
09:25:26,460 --> 09:25:29,460
Question harder than the Dark Souls boss because I love so many people.

3754
09:25:29,460 --> 09:25:32,460
There's like five people streaming right now that I wish I could rate all at the same time.

3755
09:25:32,460 --> 09:25:36,460
Just split you all like 25, 20 people.

3756
09:25:36,460 --> 09:25:37,460
You go there.

3757
09:25:37,460 --> 09:25:38,460
You go there.

3758
09:25:38,460 --> 09:25:39,460
All right.

3759
09:25:39,460 --> 09:25:40,460
Tell mercy I say hi.

3760
09:25:40,460 --> 09:25:45,460
Just say all you got to say is surprise and then you just say like a funny noise.

3761
09:25:45,460 --> 09:25:48,460
Just be like, that's what she did to me.

3762
09:25:48,460 --> 09:25:50,460
I want to bed though.

3763
09:25:50,460 --> 09:25:53,460
I'm knocking out because I've been streaming since two.

3764
09:25:53,460 --> 09:25:54,460
Holy crap.

3765
09:25:54,460 --> 09:25:56,460
I started streaming nine hours ago.

3766
09:25:56,460 --> 09:25:57,460
I just looked at my own thing.

3767
09:25:57,460 --> 09:25:58,460
What the hell is wrong with me?

3768
09:25:58,460 --> 09:26:00,460
I'm really a product.

3769
09:26:00,460 --> 09:26:02,460
I'm really my mother's daughter.

3770
09:26:02,460 --> 09:26:04,460
I can't even fucking talk.

3771
09:26:04,460 --> 09:26:13,460
How do you type a bunny noise?

3772
09:26:13,460 --> 09:26:14,460
I don't know.

3773
09:26:14,460 --> 09:26:15,460
Go bunny noise.

3774
09:26:15,460 --> 09:26:16,460
Bunny noise.

3775
09:26:16,460 --> 09:26:19,460
You can just be like bunny noises and asterisks.

3776
09:26:19,460 --> 09:26:21,460
I'm so tired.

3777
09:26:21,460 --> 09:26:23,460
I don't even remember how to end stream.

3778
09:26:23,460 --> 09:26:24,460
Okay.

3779
09:26:24,460 --> 09:26:25,460
There we go.

3780
09:26:25,460 --> 09:26:27,460
I'm like, how the fuck?

3781
09:26:27,460 --> 09:26:29,460
I'm so like Elden Ringbrained right now.

3782
09:26:29,460 --> 09:26:31,460
I'm just like, huh?

3783
09:26:31,460 --> 09:26:33,460
What's happening?

3784
09:26:33,460 --> 09:26:43,460
I was going to talk to Strani.

3785
09:26:43,460 --> 09:26:45,460
I want to ask you that.

3786
09:26:45,460 --> 09:26:46,460
Yes.

3787
09:26:46,460 --> 09:26:48,460
I know I'm on my end extreme, but I'm going to talk to you on my next screen.

3788
09:26:48,460 --> 09:27:01,460
Help me convince Strani to do a cover of, um, wait, what's the song called?

3789
09:27:01,460 --> 09:27:16,460
The song from the Lord of the Rings that Ed Sheeran sings.

3790
09:27:16,460 --> 09:27:17,460
I see fire.

3791
09:27:17,460 --> 09:27:18,460
Yes.

3792
09:27:18,460 --> 09:27:22,460
I want to do a cover of I see fire with Strani.

3793
09:27:22,460 --> 09:27:23,460
Convince her to do it with me.

3794
09:27:23,460 --> 09:27:27,460
I haven't asked her yet, but I will.

3795
09:27:27,460 --> 09:27:30,460
Also, my goal XLR came in.

3796
09:27:30,460 --> 09:27:31,460
Thank you.

3797
09:27:31,460 --> 09:27:32,460
I'm going to put that together.

3798
09:27:32,460 --> 09:27:33,460
Together.

3799
09:27:33,460 --> 09:27:34,460
I can't talk at all.

3800
09:27:34,460 --> 09:27:35,460
Oh my God.

3801
09:27:35,460 --> 09:27:36,460
I'm so tired.

3802
09:27:36,460 --> 09:27:38,460
Um, I'm going to put that together tomorrow.

3803
09:27:38,460 --> 09:27:46,460
I'll see if I can do some funky shit because I was waiting for that so I can do, um, reverb

3804
09:27:46,460 --> 09:27:50,460
a lot easily for, for karaoke.

3805
09:27:50,460 --> 09:27:53,460
So maybe member stream will be karaoke.

3806
09:27:53,460 --> 09:27:54,460
Hmm.

3807
09:27:54,460 --> 09:27:55,460
Hmm.

3808
09:27:55,460 --> 09:27:56,460
Hmm.

3809
09:27:56,460 --> 09:27:57,460
Hmm.

3810
09:27:57,460 --> 09:27:58,460
Hmm.

3811
09:27:58,460 --> 09:28:02,460
Why are you claimed if I do that though?

3812
09:28:02,460 --> 09:28:03,460
Or should I do an archive?

3813
09:28:03,460 --> 09:28:05,460
How do I, I don't even know how that works.

3814
09:28:05,460 --> 09:28:07,460
I don't know how YouTube works.

3815
09:28:07,460 --> 09:28:13,460
Um, but anyways, uh, stay beautiful, stay gorgeous, stay you, stay amazing.

3816
09:28:13,460 --> 09:28:15,460
I hope you enjoyed our chat tonight.

3817
09:28:15,460 --> 09:28:16,460
I know I enjoyed it.

3818
09:28:16,460 --> 09:28:19,460
Um, again, if you didn't agree with something that I said, you're totally entitled to that.

3819
09:28:19,460 --> 09:28:21,460
And, you know, you can disagree.

3820
09:28:21,460 --> 09:28:23,460
I still love you.

3821
09:28:23,460 --> 09:28:25,460
No, I don't.

3822
09:28:25,460 --> 09:28:26,460
I didn't say that.

3823
09:28:26,460 --> 09:28:27,460
You smell.

3824
09:28:27,460 --> 09:28:28,460
You stink so bad.

3825
09:28:28,460 --> 09:28:29,460
God damn.

3826
09:28:29,460 --> 09:28:30,460
Take a shower, bro.

3827
09:28:30,460 --> 09:28:31,460
Jesus Christ.

3828
09:28:31,460 --> 09:28:33,460
My harem smells.

3829
09:28:33,460 --> 09:28:35,460
Anyways, I'll see.

3830
09:28:35,460 --> 09:28:37,460
What am I doing tomorrow?

3831
09:28:37,460 --> 09:28:39,460
Am I streaming tomorrow?

3832
09:28:39,460 --> 09:28:41,460
How am I doing?

3833
09:28:41,460 --> 09:28:45,460
Am I doing Hades or ASMR?

3834
09:28:45,460 --> 09:28:48,460
I still didn't fix my fucking 3DU.

3835
09:28:49,460 --> 09:28:50,460
Whoopsies.

3836
09:28:50,460 --> 09:28:52,460
Anyways, I'll leave you with that.

3837
09:28:57,460 --> 09:28:59,460
I hope you have a good time.

3838
09:29:02,460 --> 09:29:03,460
I hope you have a good time.

3839
09:29:03,460 --> 09:29:04,460
What?

3840
09:29:04,460 --> 09:29:06,460
I don't even know what I'm talking about.

3841
09:29:09,460 --> 09:29:12,460
Just, let me just turn off my microphone and stop, stop talking.

3842
09:29:12,460 --> 09:29:13,460
I'm tired.

3843
09:29:13,460 --> 09:29:14,460
Oh my God.

3844
09:29:14,460 --> 09:29:16,460
Good night.

3845
09:29:16,460 --> 09:29:20,460
Don't let the sheebie bite.

3846
09:29:22,460 --> 09:29:23,460
Heehee.

3847
09:29:46,460 --> 09:30:07,460
Oh yeah, happy 4th, bye.
