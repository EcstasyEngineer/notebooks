39:30.300 --> 39:35.100

39:39.660 --> 39:44.780

Okay. Okay. I'm ready. I'm ready. Okay. All right. Let's not calm down and run. Just go for it.

40:34.940 --> 40:36.780
We don't need it. We don't need it.

40:41.980 --> 40:46.060
This is fine. Look, speed run. Speed run. Which way do we go? Okay. I think it's this way.

42:17.580 --> 42:20.220
Swing me over. Somebody pull up.

42:24.060 --> 42:28.060

42:28.220 --> 42:30.860
All right.

42:34.860 --> 42:36.460
I keep falling on the other side.

42:51.740 --> 42:56.060
What if you jumped to the other side? You want us to jump? All right.

42:56.140 --> 43:04.620
A zero. We got this. Wait. We almost got Freya. All right. We'll just jump. Yeah. Okay. Three, two, one. Go.

43:08.620 --> 43:13.820
All right. That's fine. That's fine. We're back. We're so back.

43:14.140 --> 43:26.940
I was so busy laughing at Freya just running off that I couldn't. I didn't walk backwards to stop

43:26.940 --> 43:36.380
Azura from flying off and I literally. I was trying to pull. I can't. I'm literally ori losing my voice

43:36.620 --> 43:38.940
laughing and yelling.

43:41.500 --> 43:49.500
You know what I mean? My moms are like, my moms are like, why? Why are you like this? Oh, we are so

43:49.500 --> 43:54.940
not back. It's already hanging. We're just climbing a ladder.

43:54.940 --> 44:03.500
What the fuck are you doing?

44:08.700 --> 44:15.580
All right, Freya. We'll pull you up. Just like the other of you. You're just a stripper.

44:16.300 --> 44:22.220
On the pole. All right. Azura, are you paying attention?

44:30.700 --> 44:42.220
I was watching Azura. Azura. Azura. Azura, did you just connect? Oh, no. Azura, please.

44:46.540 --> 44:47.740
Oh my god.

44:51.580 --> 44:59.260
Fatal error. Oh my god. How do you have a cracked out PC and it just keeps shooting the bed?

45:01.420 --> 45:03.900
A player has disconnected, respawning.

45:08.220 --> 45:13.500
Wait, if she spawns back in, is she gonna appear with us? I think so. All right.

45:14.460 --> 45:17.980
Azura, make as much progress as we can while she's gone.

45:20.220 --> 45:29.180
She's dragging a pole. Damn, damn. I think my game is not framed properly on OPS.

45:32.780 --> 45:41.260
Ah, my neck. My back. All right, I'm ready. Okay, ready? Three, two, one, go. Nice. Three,

45:41.260 --> 45:48.380

45:49.180 --> 45:52.540
Hello, fate, mythos. Thank you so much for the radio.

45:54.700 --> 45:59.020
Trying to find her. She's being full time pretty and welcome to the change together challenge game.

45:59.020 --> 46:05.820
Oh no, the hag Maxine. Her hag's there with that. I'm 56, so.

46:06.380 --> 46:11.180
Well, I'm a thousand years old. Well, shit, you got me beat.

46:12.860 --> 46:17.260
Wow, very cool. Three, two, oh wait. Oh, oh, oh, yeah.

46:21.260 --> 46:25.420
It's her. Hello. Thank you so much for the sub. Thank you. Thank you.

46:26.060 --> 46:40.220
Three, two, one. Blast off. Blast off, three, two, one. Blast off, three, two, one. Blast off.

46:41.740 --> 46:45.740
All right. Okay, perfect. Wait, where the fuck are we going? This way.

46:47.420 --> 46:53.660
Oh, in here. Oh, there's up here, up here. This way. Oh, it's another ladder. I'm being,

46:54.380 --> 46:58.380
she's called on. Hold on. She's clipped through the wall. Come back around.

47:01.900 --> 47:07.180
I can't move. There are chains turned silver. I swear they were black earlier.

47:09.340 --> 47:15.100
Hello, everybody. I am Apollo. Thank you so much for following me. I am the goddess of music.

47:16.460 --> 47:22.620
Oh, this one's gonna be a killer and a bitch. Sorry. No, no, you're fine. This is gonna be a killer.

47:22.620 --> 47:30.620
Look at that. Oh, all right. We did it before when they were. All right. So we just got to run and jump.

47:33.820 --> 47:38.380
Or die. That's all so good. We're fine. We're fine. We're fine.

47:40.380 --> 47:43.900
Back off from those lasers. I'm crying.

47:43.900 --> 47:48.860
I can't. Okay, I'm pulling. I'm pulling. Move back. Move back.

47:52.860 --> 47:57.980
That actually helped us. I think we're still going. Yeah, we're still, we're still in it. We're still in it.

47:57.980 --> 48:01.500
I'm up. I'm up. I'm up. I'm up. I'm back down. I'm up.

48:06.540 --> 48:10.220
Oh, she's loop-jumped her. Wait, I wonder if this will be to our advantage. Can we jump?

48:10.220 --> 48:12.940
Yeah. Let's try it. Let's try it. Ready? Ready? Let's go.

48:12.940 --> 48:18.620
Let's get closer. Let's go. Jump. It's fine. We're good. We got the hack, bros.

48:23.260 --> 48:29.260
We're just looping around. Wait, if Rhea jumps over. No, I just have to do good.

48:32.860 --> 48:39.420
It's fine. I'm backing up. I was trying to run away from it.

48:39.740 --> 48:47.020
The struggle is real. We're so math flying.

48:48.620 --> 48:53.260
All right. I mean, we did do it like that though. Like run and jump. One on the side

48:54.060 --> 49:00.540
and then one in the middle. We've got this. Let's do it. Okay. Cool. Run. Run. Jump again.

49:01.980 --> 49:06.460
No, if you sprint. I think we should run. I think we should run with it and then jump

49:06.540 --> 49:09.580
over and let's come back. I agree, you're a strat.

49:11.580 --> 49:11.880
Okay.

49:15.260 --> 49:17.020
We're going to wait for it. Let's come back.

49:17.020 --> 49:24.020
Oh, yeah, let's go.

49:24.020 --> 49:26.020
Pro gamer.

49:26.020 --> 49:27.020
Over here.

49:27.020 --> 49:28.020
Okay.

49:28.020 --> 49:31.020
Can we make this?

49:31.020 --> 49:32.020
Yeah.

49:32.020 --> 49:33.020
Oh, we did.

49:33.020 --> 49:34.020
Okay.

49:34.020 --> 49:35.020
Okay.

49:35.020 --> 49:36.020
Just wait.

49:36.020 --> 49:39.020
I hear it to the other jumping pad over there.

49:39.020 --> 49:40.020
That's fine.

49:40.020 --> 49:41.020
We got this.

49:41.020 --> 49:42.020
Go.

49:42.020 --> 49:43.020
What?

49:43.020 --> 49:44.020
What?

49:44.020 --> 49:45.020
What's happening?

49:46.020 --> 49:47.020
What's happening?

49:47.020 --> 49:49.020
Now we just got it.

49:49.020 --> 49:50.020
Jumped in.

49:50.020 --> 49:51.020
Come on.

49:51.020 --> 49:52.020
Come on.

49:52.020 --> 49:53.020
Come on.

49:53.020 --> 49:54.020
Hail.

49:54.020 --> 49:55.020
Hail.

49:55.020 --> 49:56.020
Why?

49:56.020 --> 49:57.020
Hail.

49:57.020 --> 50:01.020
Oh, it has actually worked out.

50:01.020 --> 50:02.020
Oh, don't let go.

50:02.020 --> 50:03.020
I'm not letting go.

50:03.020 --> 50:04.020
I'm not letting go.

50:04.020 --> 50:05.020
I'm not letting go.

50:05.020 --> 50:06.020
I'm not letting go.

50:06.020 --> 50:07.020
I'm not letting go.

50:07.020 --> 50:08.020
Wow.

50:08.020 --> 50:10.020
This is a beautiful mountain gelmere.

50:10.020 --> 50:12.020
You got Mordor over there.

50:12.020 --> 50:13.020
Damn.

50:13.020 --> 50:14.020
Where'd the guy go?

50:14.020 --> 50:16.020
Oh, he's all the way down there.

50:16.020 --> 50:18.020
Now look at him.

50:18.020 --> 50:20.020
Oh, here's the screams of the dams.

50:20.020 --> 50:22.020
Oh, there he is.

50:25.020 --> 50:27.020
Fly, you fools.

50:27.020 --> 50:29.020
No, fly more.

50:29.020 --> 50:30.020
You can let go.

50:30.020 --> 50:32.020
It'll automatically drop us.

50:32.020 --> 50:34.020
Oh, the car.

50:34.020 --> 50:36.020
Oh, we got a car.

50:36.020 --> 50:38.020
Oh, well.

50:38.020 --> 50:40.020
Allo.

50:40.020 --> 50:42.020
Have fun.

50:43.020 --> 50:46.020
I like how this guy always is just like,

50:46.020 --> 50:48.020
if you move your mouse around,

50:48.020 --> 50:50.020
he just like goes to the opposite.

50:50.020 --> 50:52.020
I love you.

50:52.020 --> 50:53.020
Okay.

50:53.020 --> 50:54.020
Here you go.

50:54.020 --> 50:55.020
Here you go.

50:55.020 --> 50:56.020
Here you go.

50:56.020 --> 50:57.020
Zoom through it.

50:57.020 --> 50:58.020
Ah!

50:58.020 --> 51:00.020
She hesitated.

51:00.020 --> 51:02.020
Hesitation means death.

51:02.020 --> 51:04.020
Where'd the car go?

51:04.020 --> 51:07.020
Hesitation is the thing.

51:07.020 --> 51:09.020
So, who's turn is the next?

51:09.020 --> 51:11.020
I'm ready to drive this flight.

51:11.020 --> 51:12.020
Go for it.

51:12.020 --> 51:14.020
Go for it.

51:14.020 --> 51:16.020
Here we go.

51:16.020 --> 51:18.020
I'm so ready for Fran.

51:18.020 --> 51:20.020
Well, I love her.

51:20.020 --> 51:22.020
Drive the song.

51:22.020 --> 51:24.020
You're the queen.

51:24.020 --> 51:26.020
She was gonna drive the song.

51:30.020 --> 51:32.020
Never let Apollo drive.

51:32.020 --> 51:34.020
What do you mean?

51:34.020 --> 51:35.020
Never let Fran drive.

51:35.020 --> 51:36.020
Okay, Azera.

51:36.020 --> 51:38.020
Azera, you're next.

51:38.020 --> 51:40.020
Azera, drive.

51:41.020 --> 51:43.020
No Fran, don't touch it yet.

51:43.020 --> 51:44.020
I'm not.

51:44.020 --> 51:45.020
I'm not.

51:45.020 --> 51:46.020
I'm not.

51:46.020 --> 51:48.020
Clicky, clicky, clicky.

51:48.020 --> 51:50.020
Azera, you got this.

51:50.020 --> 51:52.020
To the left, to the left turn.

51:52.020 --> 51:54.020
To the left, to the left turn.

51:54.020 --> 51:56.020
Alright, Apollo might have to be the one

51:56.020 --> 51:58.020
that drives us.

51:58.020 --> 52:00.020
Why is the turn so long?

52:00.020 --> 52:02.020
It's hard to steer.

52:02.020 --> 52:04.020
Wait, what do you steer with?

52:04.020 --> 52:06.020
I don't know.

52:06.020 --> 52:08.020
At the AD.

52:08.020 --> 52:10.020
Oh, okay.

52:18.020 --> 52:20.020
Oh, my God.

52:20.020 --> 52:22.020
The AD is AD.

52:22.020 --> 52:24.020
She's always just A and B.

52:24.020 --> 52:25.020
Okay.

52:25.020 --> 52:27.020
A and D and...

52:29.020 --> 52:32.020
I wonder if you know how to live in Tokyo

52:32.020 --> 52:34.020
if you see it and you need it

52:34.020 --> 52:36.020
and you know you got to go

52:36.020 --> 52:38.020
faster than you.

52:41.020 --> 52:43.020
To the left, to the left slowly.

52:45.020 --> 52:47.020
Rose, it's alright.

52:47.020 --> 52:49.020
I'm a pro.

52:49.020 --> 52:51.020
I'm a pro.

52:51.020 --> 52:53.020
I'm a pro.

52:58.020 --> 53:00.020
Come back, come back.

53:00.020 --> 53:02.020
The AD is real.

53:03.020 --> 53:05.020
I didn't think you...

53:05.020 --> 53:07.020
Okay, okay.

53:07.020 --> 53:09.020
We're fine.

53:09.020 --> 53:11.020
We're good.

53:11.020 --> 53:13.020
You're a pro.

53:13.020 --> 53:15.020
Pro-stress.

53:15.020 --> 53:17.020
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

53:17.020 --> 53:19.020
We made it, boys.

53:19.020 --> 53:21.020
We made it.

53:21.020 --> 53:23.020
Years of Mario Kart.

53:23.020 --> 53:25.020
Owned my skill.

53:25.020 --> 53:27.020
Now this part, we just got to time it

53:27.020 --> 53:29.020
to what the direction is.

53:29.020 --> 53:31.020
We shouldn't be too hard, I believe.

53:31.020 --> 53:33.020
And we just got, you can just jump.

53:33.020 --> 53:35.020
Yeah, I want to get closer.

53:35.020 --> 53:37.020
We just jump on it and kind of do it.

53:37.020 --> 53:40.020
We just jump until it turns because, yeah.

53:40.020 --> 53:42.020
Okay.

53:42.020 --> 53:44.020
And go.

53:44.020 --> 53:46.020
And jump.

53:48.020 --> 53:50.020
And jump.

53:50.020 --> 53:52.020
And jump.

53:52.020 --> 53:54.020
There you go, there you go.

53:54.020 --> 53:56.020
We're back, we're back.

53:56.020 --> 53:58.020
And jump.

53:58.020 --> 54:00.020
There's a weird version of dance, dance, revolution.

54:00.020 --> 54:02.020
For some reason.

54:02.020 --> 54:04.020
Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit.

54:06.020 --> 54:08.020
I tried to recover it, I tried.

54:08.020 --> 54:10.020
Oh, wait.

54:10.020 --> 54:12.020
Oh, we're back here?

54:12.020 --> 54:14.020
Oh, okay.

54:14.020 --> 54:16.020
Oh, we missed our ride.

54:16.020 --> 54:18.020
Well, hey, it's okay.

54:18.020 --> 54:20.020
Oh, wait, let's go back.

54:20.020 --> 54:22.020
And go.

54:22.020 --> 54:24.020
Wait, we're going back.

54:24.020 --> 54:26.020
Wait, are we going back?

54:26.020 --> 54:28.020
No, we're going to the right spot.

54:28.020 --> 54:30.020
Oh, for a second it glitched out for me.

54:30.020 --> 54:32.020
And I was like, we what?

54:32.020 --> 54:34.020
Oh, hello.

54:34.020 --> 54:36.020
I can't get about it.

54:36.020 --> 54:38.020
Okay, jump, jump, jump.

54:38.020 --> 54:40.020
Oh, perfect. There we go.

54:40.020 --> 54:42.020
Got it, got it, got it, got it.

54:42.020 --> 54:44.020
Hello, thank you so much for coming.

54:44.020 --> 54:46.020
I'm getting like, super pulled here.

54:46.020 --> 54:48.020
I'm sorry.

54:48.020 --> 54:50.020
I have no control over what I do.

54:50.020 --> 54:52.020
Sign in, sign.

54:52.020 --> 54:54.020
We just got back.

54:54.020 --> 54:56.020
Sign in, sign.

54:56.020 --> 54:58.020
We just got to climb up.

54:58.020 --> 55:00.020
Oh, is this just jumping?

55:00.020 --> 55:02.020
Okay, jump.

55:02.020 --> 55:04.020
If one of us can't make it, we just kind of pull them.

55:04.020 --> 55:06.020
Yeah, the rest of us can make it.

55:06.020 --> 55:08.020
We got this.

55:08.020 --> 55:10.020
Oh, oh, I'm falling.

55:10.020 --> 55:12.020
Okay, no, we're good, we're good, come on.

55:12.020 --> 55:14.020
Pull me up, pull me up, bro.

55:14.020 --> 55:16.020
Pull me up, bro.

55:16.020 --> 55:18.020
Yippee.

55:18.020 --> 55:20.020
Move over here.

55:20.020 --> 55:22.020
Wait, just kidding.

55:22.020 --> 55:24.020
Oh, my God.

55:24.020 --> 55:26.020
Oh, you can jump on the corners.

55:26.020 --> 55:28.020
Oh, okay, that makes it a lot easier.

55:28.020 --> 55:30.020
Can I pull Azura?

55:30.020 --> 55:32.020
Okay.

55:32.020 --> 55:34.020
Thank you.

55:34.020 --> 55:36.020
So we can just jump up onto the corner?

55:36.020 --> 55:38.020
Yeah.

55:38.020 --> 55:40.020
Yeah?

55:40.020 --> 55:42.020
Sometimes it lets me.

55:42.020 --> 55:44.020
All right, when you guys are free,

55:44.020 --> 55:46.020
can you pull?

55:46.020 --> 55:48.020
Pull here, pull over here.

55:48.020 --> 55:50.020
Yay, I made it.

55:50.020 --> 55:52.020
Why am I stuck under?

55:52.020 --> 55:54.020
All right, perfect.

55:54.020 --> 55:56.020
Perfect.

55:56.020 --> 55:58.020
Yeah.

55:58.020 --> 56:00.020
How are you able to do that?

56:00.020 --> 56:02.020
I was able to do it once

56:02.020 --> 56:04.020
and then I couldn't do it again.

56:04.020 --> 56:06.020
I think only two people can do it at a time.

56:06.020 --> 56:08.020
I am dead.

56:08.020 --> 56:10.020
There we go, there we go, there we go.

56:10.020 --> 56:12.020
One of these flames of fire.

56:12.020 --> 56:14.020
Where do we go next?

56:14.020 --> 56:16.020
We go that way?

56:16.020 --> 56:18.020
All right.

56:18.020 --> 56:20.020
One.

56:20.020 --> 56:22.020
Oh, God.

56:22.020 --> 56:24.020
This is just jumping, this will be easier.

56:24.020 --> 56:26.020
Azura, lead the way.

56:26.020 --> 56:28.020
Me, why me?

56:28.020 --> 56:30.020
Because you get pulled around by us,

56:30.020 --> 56:32.020
so it's your turn to pull us.

56:32.020 --> 56:34.020
Why am I off to the side?

56:34.020 --> 56:36.020
I am always standing sideways.

56:36.020 --> 56:38.020
Any home?

56:38.020 --> 56:40.020
What?

56:40.020 --> 56:42.020
It's a small jump, it's a small jump.

56:42.020 --> 56:44.020
You got to go push and then back.

56:44.020 --> 56:46.020
Push back.

56:46.020 --> 56:48.020
Oh, no.

56:48.020 --> 56:50.020
Oh, no.

56:50.020 --> 56:52.020
Okay, okay, okay.

56:52.020 --> 56:54.020
It's all over you.

56:54.020 --> 56:56.020
No!

56:56.020 --> 56:58.020
I couldn't pull you off.

57:00.020 --> 57:02.020
Okay, so when you're jumping,

57:02.020 --> 57:04.020
push and then back.

57:04.020 --> 57:06.020
You got to pull back.

57:06.020 --> 57:08.020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

57:08.020 --> 57:10.020
Three, two, one.

57:10.020 --> 57:12.020
Are we just going for it?

57:12.020 --> 57:14.020
Three, two, one.

57:14.020 --> 57:16.020
Small jumps, small jumps.

57:16.020 --> 57:18.020
Three, two, one.

57:20.020 --> 57:22.020
Okay, we got it.

57:22.020 --> 57:24.020
Three, two, one.

57:24.020 --> 57:26.020
Oh, shit.

57:26.020 --> 57:28.020
I slid off.

57:28.020 --> 57:30.020
I slid off.

57:30.020 --> 57:32.020
We are doing so good.

57:32.020 --> 57:34.020
We can do it again.

57:34.020 --> 57:36.020
We can do it again.

57:36.020 --> 57:38.020
Okay, okay.

57:38.020 --> 57:40.020
We've got this.

57:40.020 --> 57:42.020
Okay, okay, okay.

57:42.020 --> 57:44.020
Who's the best gamer sub?

57:44.020 --> 57:46.020
Use code up.

57:46.020 --> 57:48.020
Go on.

57:52.020 --> 57:54.020
Yeah.

57:54.020 --> 57:56.020
Code, yum.

57:56.020 --> 57:58.020
Yum, yum.

57:58.020 --> 58:00.020
Code TV.

58:00.020 --> 58:02.020
What is happening?

58:02.020 --> 58:04.020
Oh, gaming.

58:04.020 --> 58:06.020
This is pretty cool actually.

58:06.020 --> 58:08.020
I feel like I'm doing double Dutch.

58:08.020 --> 58:10.020
Do, do, do, do.

58:10.020 --> 58:12.860
Little dunce, doo dunce, doo dunce, doo dunce,

58:12.860 --> 58:14.520

58:14.520 --> 58:17.020
Doo dunce, doo dunce.

58:17.020 --> 58:21.280
Ah, I'm out of breath.

58:21.280 --> 58:23.400
Okay, are you yeah ready?

58:23.400 --> 58:25.440
Three, two, one!

58:28.460 --> 58:29.520
I got her!

58:29.520 --> 58:32.060
My cat's food is going off!

58:32.060 --> 58:35.680
Wow!

58:35.680 --> 58:38.620
Wow!

58:38.620 --> 58:39.880
Ow...

58:39.880 --> 58:41.680
about looking at this disappointment.

58:41.680 --> 58:42.560
Damn!

58:42.560 --> 58:43.720
Don't go out and do me like that.

58:43.720 --> 58:45.060
We trying.

58:45.060 --> 58:45.900
Come here, Bea.

58:45.900 --> 58:48.440
I'm gonna bring my cat to her food bowl.

58:48.440 --> 58:49.280
Yeah.

58:49.280 --> 58:51.280
Come here, you go fish meal.

58:56.080 --> 58:58.480
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

58:58.480 --> 59:00.280
Sorry, my cat's legs don't work.

59:02.360 --> 59:03.520
She's fine.

59:03.520 --> 59:05.320
I got her to her food bowl.

59:05.320 --> 59:06.320
Do you just throw up?

59:10.240 --> 59:11.240
What?

59:13.760 --> 59:16.000
Oh, there we go.

59:16.000 --> 59:18.200
Poles are close to me.

59:18.200 --> 59:19.800
Yeah.

59:19.800 --> 59:22.000
I want to be so close to you.

59:22.000 --> 59:23.120
Oh, I want to be close.

59:26.840 --> 59:27.720
So close.

59:27.720 --> 59:30.360
That's so sexy.

59:30.360 --> 59:32.720
I love a woman that can just burp into my face.

59:35.200 --> 59:36.240
I like that.

59:36.240 --> 59:39.720
Smells like Gamer Sub's lean.

59:39.720 --> 59:42.240
I love it.

59:42.240 --> 59:47.320
And it's really funny because my cat just jumped off the screen.

59:47.320 --> 59:47.920
Oh, I'm dead.

59:47.920 --> 59:49.120
OK.

59:49.120 --> 59:49.600
I'm ready.

59:49.600 --> 59:50.000
We ready?

59:50.000 --> 59:51.440
We ready?

59:51.440 --> 59:52.400
Ready.

59:52.400 --> 59:55.960
Three, two, one.

59:55.960 --> 59:57.240
Three, two, one.

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:01.600
Oh, he jumped off the car.

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:02.400
No, it's good.

01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:04.200
I can get on this limb.

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:06.200
Oh, thank you.

01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:09.200
Oh.

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:11.200
I'm going to need you to.

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:12.200
Oh, well.

01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:14.200
Pfft.

01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:15.200
Oh, no.

01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:20.440
Yeah, I got to my chat.

01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:21.560
I got Fia's meds today.

01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:23.120
So hopefully that goes away soon.

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:25.640
She gets like this weird virus where her body is just like,

01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:27.440
I can't walk.

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:32.280
But she should be good after some antibiotics.

01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:33.440
She's a tough one.

01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:35.040
I love her to death.

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:38.720
She's my little baby girl.

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:39.680
All right.

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:42.960
Three, two, one.

01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:44.440
Baby steps, baby steps.

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:46.520
Three, two, one.

01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:47.520
Baby steps, baby steps.

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:48.760
Oh, oh, there we go.

01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:49.320
There we go.

01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:51.440
Three, two, one.

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:53.600
This looks like tofu.

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:54.720
OK, OK, OK.

01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:55.880
OK.

01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:59.360
Three, two, one.

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:00.200
OK, OK.

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:02.840
Three, two, one.

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:04.840
Oh, shit.

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:05.840
Two, zero.

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:07.960
Get to the other side.

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:09.680
Let me swing.

01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:11.520
Is there a don't move so much?

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:13.600
Ah, I'm not swinging anymore.

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:14.960
I'm not swinging anymore.

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:16.360
Guys, don't move.

01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:18.200
Swingings, are you swinging?

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:19.600
I'm just constantly pulling.

01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:21.240
I'm not swinging anymore.

01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:22.680
All right, all right, there we go.

01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:24.520
Stay calm.

01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:26.240
Stay calm, collected.

01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:28.360
Freya, don't.

01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:29.360
Oh, that actually worked out.

01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:29.860
I made it.

01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:30.360
I made it.

01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:31.360
I made it.

01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:33.320
Yeah, let's jump across.

01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:36.800
Then that gives us some more room.

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:43.760
Yeah, it's your sensitivity, so why?

01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:47.200
You just fly off the platform when you get up.

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:48.680
OK, ready?

01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:49.180
Ready?

01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:50.600
Really bad at video games.

01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:53.280
Three, two, one.

01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:54.280
That was a little early.

01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:56.000
Speedcore.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.240
Speedrun, go.

01:01:57.240 --> 01:01:58.520
Speedrun, go.

01:01:58.520 --> 01:01:59.520
Oh, never mind.

01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:06.200
Speedrun is not in my speedrun.

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:09.800
OK, OK.

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:12.800
I like how far the stairs are to follow.

01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:15.800
Oh, jeez.

01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:16.800
I'm trying to pull.

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:18.800
I'm trying to pull.

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:19.800
Oh, all right.

01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:20.800
Woo.

01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:22.800
OK.

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:24.800
Nice count.

01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:28.800
What is this?

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:31.800
We were so unified before.

01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:32.800
Easy jump.

01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:33.800
Easy jump.

01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:34.800
We've got this.

01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:35.800
Easy.

01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:38.800
Easy jump.

01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:39.800
Oh, no, this next thing was.

01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:40.800
Pause.

01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:41.800
Pause.

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:42.800
Oh, never mind.

01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:45.800
We're fine.

01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:46.800
OK, we just got out of there.

01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:48.800
This has to be timing.

01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:49.800
Ready?

01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:50.800
Here we go.

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:52.800
Get closer, Sarah.

01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:54.800
Go.

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:56.800
Go.

01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:57.800
Wait.

01:02:57.800 --> 01:02:59.800
I don't think we did a good job.

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:01.800
Oh.

01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:04.800
I am fine.

01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:07.800
Oh, never mind.

01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:10.800
Yippee.

01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:11.800
OK, OK, OK.

01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:12.800
Let's do that again.

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:13.800
Get closer, everyone.

01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:14.800
Everyone, Azora.

01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:17.800
Azora, honey.

01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:18.800
OK.

01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:19.800
Wait.

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:20.800
Wait.

01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:21.800
Wait.

01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:23.800
Jump.

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:26.800
Why did I overshoot that?

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:29.800
I don't understand.

01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:31.800
Well.

01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:33.800
Oh, we're fine.

01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:34.800
We're fine.

01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:35.800
We're fine.

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:36.800
We're fine.

01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:37.800
We're fine.

01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:39.800
OK, we just need to pull them up and quickly.

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:41.800
No.

01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:42.800
Jump.

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:44.800
Oh, make it to that one.

01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:45.800
Next one.

01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:46.800
Smart.

01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:47.800
Smart.

01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:48.800
All right.

01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:49.800
Where do we go now?

01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:50.800
Which way are we going?

01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:54.800
I'm trying to climb.

01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:55.800
Wait.

01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:56.800
OK, OK.

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:58.800
Oh, we're back to the top.

01:03:58.800 --> 01:03:59.800
All right.

01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:00.800
Go.

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:01.800
This way?

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:03.800
Oh.

01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:04.800
It's fine.

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:05.800
It's fine.

01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:12.800
Dude, this is so fun.

01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:13.800
No.

01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:14.800
Oh, my God.

01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:15.800
All right.

01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:16.800
OK, OK, OK.

01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:18.800
We got a speed run this.

01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:19.800
Yeah.

01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:20.800
OK, ready?

01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:21.800
Shift the sprint.

01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:22.800
Got it.

01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:23.800
Jump.

01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:24.800
Ready.

01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:25.800
Jump.

01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:26.800
Jump.

01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:27.800
Oh, what the heck?

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:28.800
Yeah, me too.

01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:30.800
I think you jump farther when you sprint.

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:34.800
We don't sprint until the jump is made.

01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:35.800
OK.

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:36.800
I agree.

01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:37.800
I don't know what's happening.

01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:38.800
I'm just kind of just hanging out.

01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:39.800
Oh.

01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:41.800
Oh, I got us.

01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:42.800
Wait.

01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:45.800
We're going to be head down.

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:46.800
OK.

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:47.800
OK.

01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:52.800
I guess no shift yet until when your feet are on the ground.

01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:53.800
Got it.

01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:54.800
Yeah.

01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:55.800
OK.

01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:56.800
Next one.

01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:57.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:04:57.800 --> 01:04:58.800
OK.

01:04:58.800 --> 01:04:59.800
Let's do this.

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:00.800
OK.

01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:01.800
And go.

01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:02.800
And oh.

01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:03.800
Oh.

01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:04.800
Oh.

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:05.800
Oh.

01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:06.800
Yeah.

01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:07.800
Carry us.

01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:08.800
Carry us to victory queen.

01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:09.800
We found out.

01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:10.800
We found out.

01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:11.800
Oh.

01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:12.800
We found out.

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:13.800
We found out.

01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:14.800
We found out.

01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:15.800
We found out.

01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:16.800
We found out.

01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:17.800
We found out.

01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:18.800
We found out.

01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:19.800
We did it.

01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:20.800
Yeah.

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:21.800
I was late.

01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:22.800
Yeah.

01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:23.800
I thought I was going to mash this all up because of that.

01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:24.800
All right.

01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:25.800
Oh, what's that?

01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:26.800
What the heck?

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:27.800
Oh, it's a timer.

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:29.800
Oh.

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:31.800
Oh, we already lost that.

01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:32.800
Yeah.

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:33.800
I think we got it.

01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:34.800
Should we try that again?

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:35.800
Hold on.

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:36.800
Hold on.

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:37.800
Hold on.

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:38.800
Hold on.

01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:39.800
OK.

01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:40.800
So like when we're climbing, we got to try to jump as fast.

01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:41.800
All right.

01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:42.800
We'll try to shift.

01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:43.800
We're going to use less time.

01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:44.800
Yeah.

01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:45.800
Actually, I think we can make that.

01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:47.800
What is this?

01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:48.800
OK.

01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:49.800
I'm back.

01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:50.800
Here we go.

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:51.800
Yeah.

01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:52.800
Yeah.

01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:53.800
Oh.

01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:54.800
Oh.

01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:55.800
Oh.

01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:56.800
Oh.

01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:57.800
Go.

01:05:57.800 --> 01:05:58.800
Go.

01:05:58.800 --> 01:05:59.800
Go.

01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:00.800
Go.

01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:01.800
Go.

01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:02.800
Go.

01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:03.800
Go.

01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:04.800
I don't know if we're going to make it, guys.

01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:05.800
We're making it.

01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:06.800
We're making it.

01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:07.800
We're making it.

01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:08.800
We're making it.

01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:09.800
We're making it.

01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:10.800
We're making it, guys.

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:11.800
We did it.

01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:12.800
We did it.

01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:13.800
We did it.

01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:14.800
We did it.

01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:15.800
We did it.

01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:16.800
We did it.

01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:17.800
Yeah.

01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:19.800
It was hard to avoid the climbing animations.

01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:20.800
Help.

01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:21.800
Oh, my God.

01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:22.800
That was scary.

01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:23.800
Thanks, Queen.

01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:24.800
We did it.

01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:25.800
We did it.

01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:26.800
Apollo with the clutch.

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:27.800
We did it.

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:28.800
We did it.

01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:29.800
We did it.

01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:30.800
Yeah.

01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:31.800
Apollo with the hard carry.

01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:32.800
Ready?

01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:33.800
Go.

01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:34.800
Nice.

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:35.800
Right off.

01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:36.800
Right.

01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:37.800
I counted us off and missed.

01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:38.800
There we go.

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:39.800
Thank you.

01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:40.800
OK.

01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:41.800
Ready?

01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:42.800
Three, two, one.

01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:43.800
Nifty.

01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:44.800
Three.

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:45.800
Oh.

01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:46.800
All right.

01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:47.800
Three.

01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:48.800
Three.

01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:49.800
Three.

01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:50.800
Three.

01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:51.800
Three.

01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:52.800
Oh, my God.

01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:53.800
An elevator.

01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:54.800
Thanks, the lords.

01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:55.800
No.

01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:57.800
I think you have an elevator.

01:06:57.800 --> 01:06:58.800
It's OK.

01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:02.800
You'll just hang around.

01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:03.800
Yeah.

01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:04.800
It's cool.

01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:05.800
I'm fine.

01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:06.800
I'm just going to chill.

01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:09.800
It's like running in midair.

01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:10.800
Oh.

01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:11.800
Oh.

01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:12.800
Oh.

01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:13.800
Yay.

01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:15.800
Oh, you guys are going to be stuck.

01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:16.800
No, they're not stuck.

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:17.800
You're fine.

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:18.800
Uh-oh.

01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:19.800
Wait.

01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:20.800
Come around.

01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:21.800
Come around the side.

01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:22.800
Come around the...

01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:23.800
Go to the opposite side for you.

01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:24.800
Go to the opposite side.

01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:25.800
We've got you.

01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:26.800
No, we've got you.

01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:27.800
Oh, it broke.

01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:28.800
It doesn't matter.

01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:29.800
Oh, OK.

01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:30.800
OK.

01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:31.800
What's happening?

01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:32.800
Pull them up.

01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:33.800
Yeah.

01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:34.800
What the hell is that?

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:35.800
Oh.

01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:36.800
This is fun.

01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:38.800
We're like one third of the way there.

01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:39.800
We're almost done.

01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:40.800
Yay.

01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:41.800
Holy crap.

01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:46.800
I'm impressed with this.

01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:47.800
No deaths.

01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:52.920
Azora and I are going to like plan to play this again in like Saturday, but we're going

01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:53.920
to be drunk.

01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:54.920
Oh, God.

01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:55.920
Oh, my goodness.

01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:56.920
How do you die?

01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:57.920
Can you die?

01:07:57.920 --> 01:07:58.920
How do you die?

01:07:58.920 --> 01:07:59.920
I can't.

01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:00.920
I just kind of went down.

01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:01.920
All right.

01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:02.920
Yeah.

01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:04.920
If you look down and go down.

01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:05.920
Cool.

01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:06.920
Yeah.

01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:07.920
I'm excited for that.

01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:09.920
Honestly impressed with the level design.

01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:10.920
I'm not going to lie.

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:11.920
Yeah.

01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:12.920
When I play Diablo.

01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:13.920
Hello Raiders.

01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:14.920
Hi.

01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:15.920
Hello.

01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:16.920
Hi Raiders.

01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:17.920
Hi Raiders.

01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:18.920
Hi Raiders.

01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:19.920
Hi sisters.

01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:20.920
Hi.

01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:21.920
Sorry.

01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:22.920
Oh, my God.

01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:23.920
Hi sisters.

01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:24.920
Hi sisters.

01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:25.920
I love that.

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:28.920
The jump scare.

01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:33.920
This is the third fate.

01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:34.920
Hades.

01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:35.920
Siri.

01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:37.920
And Nico now.

01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:38.920
Thank you.

01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:40.920
Thank you so much.

01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:42.920
I really appreciate it.

01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:44.920
It's an honor.

01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:45.920
It's an honor.

01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:50.920
We're playing chain together with a lovely, beautiful guest.

01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:51.920
Fraya.

01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:52.920
And Siby.

01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:53.920
Siby.

01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:54.920
Dule.

01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:55.920
I'm so sorry.

01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:58.920
I'm Dule now.

01:08:58.920 --> 01:08:59.920
Dule.

01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:02.920
I'm Siby Cottonbom.

01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:04.920
And Siby Cottonbom.

01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:05.920
Yes.

01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:06.920
Hi.

01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:07.920
What the hell is this?

01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:08.920
I hope the collab is going well.

01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:09.920
It's going very well.

01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:10.920
Oh, wait.

01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:11.920
Wings.

01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:12.920
Wings.

01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:13.920
Get the wings.

01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:14.920
Get the wings.

01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:15.920
Where?

01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:16.920
Wings.

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:17.920
I've never been this far.

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:18.920
Wings.

01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:19.920
Ah.

01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:23.120
Is this really only the second wings? Have we missed some?

01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:24.620
Oh, uh, probably.

01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:27.120
Oh.

01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:28.920
Yeah, I don't know how he's supposed to find all 10.

01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:30.720
Oh, anyways.

01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:31.320
Oh.

01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:32.120
What's the puzzle?

01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:32.920
We've got this.

01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:35.020
Mavikins, can we please have a shout-out to Hoda?

01:09:35.020 --> 01:09:36.120
I'm going to make you a VIP.

01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:39.120
Hee hee hee hee.

01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:41.520
Is this our final one?

01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:42.120
How do you-

01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:42.620
What?

01:09:42.620 --> 01:09:43.520
Over there.

01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:44.520
How do we-

01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:45.720
Oh, OK.

01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:46.220
I'll just uh-

01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:46.920
No, no.

01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:49.120
Someone has to stay on the end.

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:49.620
OK.

01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:51.220
So the two on the end go to the end.

01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:51.720
I'll stay.

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:53.620
I'll stay right here then.

01:09:53.620 --> 01:09:55.520
OK, then she beat go to the other one.

01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:56.420
Oh, I got it.

01:09:56.420 --> 01:09:56.920
I got it.

01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:57.420
OK.

01:09:57.420 --> 01:09:57.720
OK.

01:09:57.720 --> 01:09:58.220
OK.

01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:03.220
Are we missing one?

01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:04.720
And then what happens?

01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:06.020
Are there more buttons?

01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:07.220
Oh, there's one up there.

01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:07.820
It's time.

01:10:07.820 --> 01:10:09.120
Ah!

01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:10.020
It's time.

01:10:10.020 --> 01:10:10.920
Oh, where is it?

01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:11.420
Times.

01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:15.320
Over here, where I am.

01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:16.420
Oh, that's bad.

01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:18.420
Oh, it's up top.

01:10:18.420 --> 01:10:19.220
Damn.

01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:21.220
Are we supposed to do that?

01:10:21.220 --> 01:10:24.120
Yeah, it looks like we got to get to the little one.

01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:24.720
All right.

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:26.820
And then we got to show.

01:10:26.820 --> 01:10:27.420
OK.

01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:28.220
OK.

01:10:28.220 --> 01:10:29.520
All right.

01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:31.320
Is it really timed or-

01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:32.420
Maybe it's timed.

01:10:32.420 --> 01:10:33.720
Maybe they're just on.

01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:34.220
Yeah.

01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:35.020
I hope so.

01:10:35.020 --> 01:10:35.720
Right?

01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:36.320
No.

01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:36.820
Go.

01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:37.520
Oh.

01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:38.420
Wait, no.

01:10:38.420 --> 01:10:40.220
Oh, there's another one up there.

01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:41.720
Oh, my God.

01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:45.020
Also, this isn't the right way.

01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:46.920
OK.

01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:48.320
It's this.

01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:52.520
I think it's this way to the left side.

01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:53.320
Is it tossed around?

01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:54.320
This way?

01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:55.420
Yeah.

01:10:55.420 --> 01:10:56.920
I think-

01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:58.520
Yeah, there we go.

01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:00.420
It was tossed around in a rag doll.

01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:03.220
What is going on?

01:11:03.220 --> 01:11:04.620
OK.

01:11:04.620 --> 01:11:07.720
Over here.

01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:08.220
Climb.

01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:09.420
Climb.

01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:10.720
Climb.

01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:11.320
Climb.

01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:12.020
Climb.

01:11:12.020 --> 01:11:13.920
Ah!

01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:15.720
OK, OK.

01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:17.220
OK.

01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:19.320
She just runs off every time.

01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:20.520
OK, OK, OK.

01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:21.120
OK.

01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:21.920
Over there.

01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:22.920
Jump over here.

01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:24.720
Over here.

01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:26.420
You-

01:11:26.420 --> 01:11:28.120
You went the hardest way.

01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:28.720
OK.

01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:29.520
OK.

01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:30.820
Oh!

01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:34.020
I'm trying so hard not to fall off right now.

01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:35.920
You pressed the button, right?

01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:36.320
Yeah.

01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:37.720
Yeah, I already pressed it.

01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:40.320
Now we just need to get to the other side.

01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:40.920
Come on.

01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:42.720
All you Azura.

01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:45.120
Ah!

01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:46.520
Perfect.

01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:47.720
Ah!

01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:49.720
I need you.

01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:51.920
Pull me, pull me.

01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:52.920
Trying.

01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:54.320
It's-

01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:56.720
There we go.

01:11:56.720 --> 01:11:57.920
I was pulling Azura towards me.

01:11:57.920 --> 01:11:59.920
No problem, no problem.

01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:01.720
I don't think it has been an hour in this room.

01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:03.620
I already got three raids.

01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:04.720
That's pretty crazy.

01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:06.120
OK, this one, this one.

01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:08.020
Wee!

01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:08.720
Wee!

01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:09.520
Wee!

01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:10.520
We did it!

01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:12.520
You're-

01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:14.520
We're free, we're free.

01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:15.520
What?

01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:17.520
We did it, yeah.

01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:19.520
I see, we did it.

01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:20.520
Oh.

01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:21.520
Uh oh.

01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:23.520
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:25.520
OK, now jump.

01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:26.520
Oh!

01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:30.520
Fine, we can just carry you.

01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:31.520
Thank you.

01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:32.520
Oh, thank you.

01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:33.520
That was a little thingy.

01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:34.520
Uh oh.

01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:35.520
OK, we gotta time it.

01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:36.520
How close should we get?

01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:37.520
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:39.520
I'm not so sure about that, chief.

01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:41.520
OK, now we go, now we go.

01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:47.520
OK, let's wait, wait here.

01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:48.520
Whoa, my toesies.

01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:49.520
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:50.520
OK.

01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:51.520
All right.

01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:52.520
OK, go.

01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:53.520
I feel like Spider-Man.

01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:56.520
I think I'm the slowest out of all of us.

01:12:56.520 --> 01:12:57.520
Oh, jump.

01:12:57.520 --> 01:12:58.520
Oh.

01:12:58.520 --> 01:12:59.520
Wee.

01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:00.520
Oh my gosh.

01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:01.520
Oh, stairs.

01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:02.520
Oh, stairs.

01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:03.520
Wow.

01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:05.520
Oh, that was easy.

01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:06.520
Wee!

01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:08.520
Talk to me in sexy voice.

01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:10.520
Is Mama Freya live?

01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:11.520
Oh, oh.

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:12.520
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:13.520
Sorry.

01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:14.520
Sorry.

01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:15.520
Sorry.

01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:17.520
OK.

01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:18.520
She had to sprint through.

01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:20.520
Yeah, I believe so, ready.

01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:23.520
And, oh, I just jumped.

01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:26.520
OK.

01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:27.520
Oh, I'm like are y'all here?

01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:31.520
Azura is skirting the edge.

01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:32.520
I have to walk the way.

01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:35.520
You can't skip walking into it.

01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:37.520
I have to walk into the bridge.

01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:41.520
I don't want to pull, yeah, yeah, I don't want to pull.

01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:43.520
I am live.

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:44.280
Yeah, boy, OK.

01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:46.720
Hold on tight, spider monkey.

01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:46.960
Got it.

01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:48.080
There you go.

01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:48.400
Got it.

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:48.680
There you go.

01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:49.920
Got it.

01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:51.080
Where you been, Loka?

01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:58.760
I'm down.

01:13:58.760 --> 01:13:59.840
I'm down.

01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:00.400
I'm pulling you.

01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:01.520
I'm pulling you.

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:03.000
There you go.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.960
I think I figured out how to pull now.

01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:09.440
Yeah.

01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:14.800
Oh, man, I like what Apollo just dangled there.

01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:16.040
Dangled to victory.

01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:16.520
Ready?

01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:17.000
Jump across.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:18.000
We jump.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:18.640
Ready?

01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:20.040
Jump.

01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:22.200
I got a jump here.

01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:22.640
Oh, no.

01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:23.640
Oh, no, I'm scared.

01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:25.120
We all just backed up at the same time.

01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:25.620
Ready?

01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:26.600
I'm scared.

01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:27.400
I'm scared.

01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:27.880
Ah!

01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:28.880
I'm so scared.

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:30.400
I'm so straight on it.

01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:30.880
Sorry.

01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:35.320
Oh, nice.

01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:38.520
We're in a good spot.

01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:39.520
Oh, my gosh.

01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:45.000
I'm going to have lost my voice after this.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:46.160
Same.

01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:46.800
It's gone.

01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:49.640
I have ASMR stream tomorrow, so I guess I'm just

01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:51.400
going to have a horse voice.

01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:52.400
Hi, everybody.

01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:58.400
OK, ready?

01:14:58.400 --> 01:14:58.680
I'm going.

01:14:58.680 --> 01:14:59.400
I'm facing my fears.

01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:02.600
And go!

01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:06.920
Oh, you just missed that Apollo.

01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:09.880
My space bar was like, it didn't click.

01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:10.840
They almost panicked.

01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:14.240
OK.

01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:17.560
It's hard to see past these stupid bars.

01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:18.040
You got it.

01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:18.960
You got it.

01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:21.240
Where are we going now?

01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:23.880
Where are we going this way?

01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:24.480
Oh, wait.

01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:25.760
Are we not supposed to get off?

01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:28.360
I don't think so.

01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:30.360
We can go this way.

01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:34.000
Yeah, I think this is an area you fall at.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:38.880
Like, if you fall, you can land here in one of these areas.

01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:41.080
Also, we weren't supposed to jump off.

01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:42.440
OK, so we just jumped back off.

01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:43.840
I think we went the wrong way.

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:45.160
OK.

01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:47.760
Sorry, I have to go in that direction over there.

01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:49.640
You got right there on our left.

01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:51.200
OK, we're supposed to go over there.

01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:51.800
OK, ready?

01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:52.800
Yeah.

01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:53.800
Oh.

01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:54.640
I got on me.

01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:55.640
Thank you so much for that.

01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:59.040
I blame Apollo.

01:15:59.040 --> 01:15:59.920
You can blame me.

01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:00.960
It was all bait.

01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:02.160
Thank you so much for the raid.

01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:08.960
So nice weather we're having.

01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:12.400
Yeah, gorgeous hellscape.

01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:13.560
Oh, yeah, I love it.

01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:15.400
I kind of like it.

01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:17.920
It wouldn't be a hell unless we were chained together,

01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:18.160
though.

01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:20.880
If we were separate, it would be just a vacation home,

01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:21.960
honestly.

01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:24.760
So because we're chained together, it's hell.

01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:26.400
Mm-hmm.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:30.280
OK, don't.

01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:32.320
Oh, I'm laughing too hard.

01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:33.480
Sorry, that was me.

01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:38.800
Right on it.

01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:39.800
Oh, it's neat.

01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:41.320
Where are we?

01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:42.040
Oh, what is this?

01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:42.600
What's this pit?

01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:43.400
There's like a hole in there.

01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:44.000
Go to the hole.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.240
We find a secret spot.

01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:47.000
Oh, that's the water where we were.

01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:52.080
Hey, thank you so much for the raid.

01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:52.480
Welcome.

01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:53.880
Hell is my kind of place.

01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:56.120
Yeah, we are playing.

01:16:56.120 --> 01:16:57.600
Oh, Missouri is pulling us.

01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:00.720
Beautiful ladies of Veilor and Apollo.

01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:02.880
Hi.

01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:05.400
I am from Mythos.

01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:06.640
I am from Mythos.

01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:10.720
OK.

01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:11.880
Apollo, if we were.

01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:12.640
I think it's the only up.

01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:15.120
Sorry, it's called chained together.

01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:15.960
That too.

01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:19.960
If we were goddesses in Mythos, what would our goddess names

01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:20.920
be?

01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:23.320
Which Greek gods would it be?

01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:25.320
Let's see.

01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:30.320
Azora would be Aphrodite.

01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:32.320
Oh, that's a good one.

01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:34.320
Do we have to go over here?

01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:39.320
Because she's just she's so freaking adorable.

01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:42.320
I could see it like a shy Aphrodite be like.

01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:48.320
Hey, we're fine.

01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:50.320
We're fine.

01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:53.320
I don't see this is good.

01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:54.320
We got tossed up here.

01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:56.320
Now we go back on it.

01:17:56.320 --> 01:17:57.320
Three, two, one.

01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:01.320
Too far.

01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:02.320
Too far.

01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:04.320
Yeah, we got to wait for the next one.

01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:09.320
Don't we go?

01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:11.320
Don't we go over there?

01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:12.320
Looks like a point.

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:13.320
Over there.

01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:14.320
OK, ready?

01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:15.320
Ready?

01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:16.320
Jump.

01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:19.320
How did I not land on that?

01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:22.320
OK, we got to go the opposite way over there, I believe.

01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:23.320
Why not?

01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:24.320
Where are we trying to go?

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:25.320
Right here?

01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:26.320
Is that our jump?

01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:28.320
I would say Aris from Aris.

01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:30.320
Yeah, Aris would be cool.

01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:32.320
I think Artemis for Frio would be cool.

01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:34.320
You got jump on that.

01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:35.320
Oh, shit.

01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:37.320
We got to time it.

01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:39.320
OK, count.

01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:40.320
Three, two, one.

01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:41.320
OK, ready?

01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:42.320
Ready?

01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:43.320
Jump.

01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:44.320
Count.

01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:45.320
Three, two, one.

01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:52.320
OK, I don't know how that happened, but I did it.

01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:53.320
This guy stopped moving.

01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:55.320
Guy stopped moving.

01:18:55.320 --> 01:18:58.320
I'm pulling, pulling, pulling, pulling, pulling, pulling.

01:18:58.320 --> 01:18:59.320
I'm trying to stabilize.

01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:01.320
OK, cool.

01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:04.320
I'm going to get pulled off with a circle.

01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:05.320
All right, we're good.

01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:06.320
We good, we good.

01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:07.320
OK.

01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:08.320
Nifty.

01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:09.320
Oh, we got to go.

01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:10.320
OK, now don't kick that.

01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:11.320
You're ready to go.

01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:12.320
There it was.

01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:14.320
We did it.

01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:15.320
OK, OK, OK.

01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:17.320

01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:24.320

01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:31.320
All right.

01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:32.320

Yes.

01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:05.320

01:27:03.380 --> 01:27:04.380
It's blocking the screen.

01:27:04.380 --> 01:27:05.380

01:27:05.380 --> 01:27:06.380

We're not ready.

01:27:07.380 --> 01:27:10.380
Nobody else wants just me and you apologize.

01:27:10.380 --> 01:27:11.380

01:27:22.380 --> 01:27:23.380

01:27:23.380 --> 01:27:24.380

Thanks so much for following, honey.

01:27:36.380 --> 01:27:39.380
Is there an Apollo or like on top of each other?

01:27:39.380 --> 01:27:40.380
We're moving.

01:27:40.380 --> 01:27:42.380
Is there over a little bit?

01:27:42.380 --> 01:27:45.380
Do you want to be on top or do you want to be on bottom?

01:27:45.380 --> 01:27:46.380
Want to be on top.

01:27:46.380 --> 01:27:47.380
Sorry to sort of.

01:27:47.380 --> 01:27:49.380

01:27:54.380 --> 01:27:55.380
Go on.

01:27:59.380 --> 01:28:00.380
I'm ready to jump.

01:28:00.380 --> 01:28:01.380
Go.

01:28:01.380 --> 01:28:02.380
Okay.

01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:03.380
We're doing good.

01:28:03.380 --> 01:28:04.380
We're doing good.

01:28:04.380 --> 01:28:05.380
We've got this.

01:28:05.380 --> 01:28:07.380
Sound like you just came.

01:28:07.380 --> 01:28:08.380
Jump.

01:28:08.380 --> 01:28:09.380
Jump.

01:28:10.380 --> 01:28:11.380
Twas not high.

01:28:11.380 --> 01:28:13.380
Twas not high.

01:28:13.380 --> 01:28:15.380
That is all I will say.

01:28:20.380 --> 01:28:21.380
This is funny.

01:28:24.380 --> 01:28:26.380
Are you enjoying yourselves, guys?

01:28:26.380 --> 01:28:27.380
Yippee.

01:28:27.380 --> 01:28:28.380
Oh.

01:28:28.380 --> 01:28:29.380
We're doing good.

01:28:29.380 --> 01:28:30.380
We're doing good.

01:28:30.380 --> 01:28:31.380
We're doing good.

01:28:31.380 --> 01:28:33.380
Are you enjoying yourselves, guys?

01:28:33.380 --> 01:28:34.380
Yippee.

01:28:34.380 --> 01:28:35.380
Oh.

01:28:35.380 --> 01:28:36.380
What the heck?

01:28:36.380 --> 01:28:38.380
I can't take it off.

01:28:38.380 --> 01:28:42.380
I think I'm getting mind broken as this continues.

01:28:42.380 --> 01:28:43.380
Whoa.

01:28:43.380 --> 01:28:44.380
Okay.

01:28:44.380 --> 01:28:45.380
I'm moving back a little bit.

01:28:45.380 --> 01:28:46.380
Back of the front.

01:28:46.380 --> 01:28:48.380
Kind of like hugs me up.

01:28:48.380 --> 01:28:49.380
Azora.

01:28:49.380 --> 01:28:50.380
Azora.

01:28:50.380 --> 01:28:53.380
I didn't think she was going to move.

01:28:53.380 --> 01:28:54.380
Okay.

01:28:54.380 --> 01:28:55.380
Ready?

01:28:55.380 --> 01:28:56.380

01:28:56.380 --> 01:28:57.380
Over here.

01:28:57.380 --> 01:28:58.380
She was locked in.

01:28:58.380 --> 01:28:59.380
Go.

01:28:59.380 --> 01:29:00.380
Oh, my God.

01:29:00.380 --> 01:29:03.380
She just made that Apollo menu.

01:29:03.380 --> 01:29:06.380
Here comes another one.

01:29:06.380 --> 01:29:07.380
Oh, look.

01:29:07.380 --> 01:29:09.380
Hey, closer, ladies.

01:29:09.380 --> 01:29:10.380
Go, go, go.

01:29:10.380 --> 01:29:11.380
Oh, shit.

01:29:11.380 --> 01:29:12.380
Oh, what?

01:29:12.380 --> 01:29:13.380
What?

01:29:13.380 --> 01:29:16.380
Your guys' models are gone for me.

01:29:16.380 --> 01:29:17.380
Apollo, you're gone.

01:29:17.380 --> 01:29:19.380
Oh, Apollo just died.

01:29:19.380 --> 01:29:21.380
Apollo, you're gone.

01:29:21.380 --> 01:29:22.380
I'm dead.

01:29:22.380 --> 01:29:23.380
I'm dead.

01:29:23.380 --> 01:29:24.380
I'm dead.

01:29:24.380 --> 01:29:26.380
Jump to freedom.

01:29:26.380 --> 01:29:27.380

01:29:27.380 --> 01:29:28.380
All right.

01:29:28.380 --> 01:29:29.380
Let's pause here.

01:29:29.380 --> 01:29:30.380
Apollo, come here.

01:29:30.380 --> 01:29:31.380

01:29:44.380 --> 01:29:45.380
I'm bad.

01:29:45.380 --> 01:29:47.380
You might have crashed like I did.

01:29:47.380 --> 01:29:49.380
Oh, connection system.

01:29:49.380 --> 01:29:50.380

Ehe, ehe, ehe.

01:29:53.380 --> 01:29:54.380
Hydrate time.

01:29:54.380 --> 01:29:55.380
Good idea.

01:29:55.380 --> 01:29:56.380
Good idea.

01:29:56.380 --> 01:29:59.380
One by one, they're dying.

01:29:59.380 --> 01:30:00.380
Damn.

01:30:00.380 --> 01:30:01.380
We start my model.

01:30:01.380 --> 01:30:02.380
Sheesh.

01:30:02.380 --> 01:30:06.380
Oh, my gosh.

01:30:06.380 --> 01:30:09.380
Remember to have encrustables.

01:30:09.380 --> 01:30:14.380
Big stretch.

01:30:14.380 --> 01:30:24.380
What is happening?

01:30:24.380 --> 01:30:26.380
I'm sorry.

01:30:26.380 --> 01:30:28.380
I just got, I just let it out.

01:30:28.380 --> 01:30:30.380
I was like, oh my God.

01:30:30.380 --> 01:30:31.380
I was cute.

01:30:31.380 --> 01:30:35.380
And I ended up just like.

01:30:35.380 --> 01:30:37.380
Sometimes you got a stretch.

01:30:37.380 --> 01:30:38.380
It feels good.

01:30:38.380 --> 01:30:40.380
Connection to steam servers failed.

01:30:40.380 --> 01:30:41.380
Oh no.

01:30:41.380 --> 01:30:42.380
That's what I got to.

01:30:42.380 --> 01:30:43.380
I got that too.

01:30:43.380 --> 01:30:44.380
I got that too.

01:30:44.380 --> 01:30:45.380
I had to restart.

01:30:45.380 --> 01:30:47.380
Oh, like to restart steam.

01:30:47.380 --> 01:30:49.380
I did that already.

01:30:49.380 --> 01:30:51.380
Oh, then yes.

01:30:51.380 --> 01:30:55.380
I like horse clothes it on the end of your arm.

01:30:55.380 --> 01:30:56.380
Oh, wait.

01:30:56.380 --> 01:30:58.380
Oh, oh, it's connected.

01:30:58.380 --> 01:30:59.380
It's connected.

01:30:59.380 --> 01:31:00.380
Yeah.

01:31:00.380 --> 01:31:01.380
Welcome, baby.

01:31:01.380 --> 01:31:03.380
Let's see it.

01:31:03.380 --> 01:31:04.380
Baby.

01:31:04.380 --> 01:31:07.380
What the hell?

01:31:07.380 --> 01:31:09.380
Who the fuck is that?

01:31:09.380 --> 01:31:16.380
A ghost.

01:31:16.380 --> 01:31:19.380
Ghosts just whispers in your ear.

01:31:19.380 --> 01:31:21.380
Hey, baby.

01:31:21.380 --> 01:31:27.380
How you doing, baby?

01:31:27.380 --> 01:31:30.380
I'm taking a shit, baby.

01:31:30.380 --> 01:31:37.380
Oh, fuck yeah.

01:31:37.380 --> 01:31:40.380
That's the best feeling man.

01:31:40.380 --> 01:31:45.380
Tell me more.

01:31:45.380 --> 01:31:50.380
Hey, vengeful baby.

01:31:50.380 --> 01:31:53.380
How you doing?

01:31:53.380 --> 01:31:55.380
Steam saying a bunch of failures.

01:31:55.380 --> 01:31:56.380
I'm done.

01:31:56.380 --> 01:31:59.380
I'll talk like a really bad southern bed.

01:31:59.380 --> 01:32:04.380
I'll talk like a really bad southern bell until Apollo gets back.

01:32:04.380 --> 01:32:05.380
Did it say it failed?

01:32:05.380 --> 01:32:07.380
It said that you rejoined.

01:32:07.380 --> 01:32:10.380
I saw it.

01:32:10.380 --> 01:32:11.380
Hello.

01:32:11.380 --> 01:32:13.380
I'm here.

01:32:13.380 --> 01:32:16.380
I was wondering if after all this years.

01:32:16.380 --> 01:32:18.380
I was like me.

01:32:18.380 --> 01:32:21.380
I was literally about to start singing that.

01:32:21.380 --> 01:32:25.380
You took the words right out my mouth.

01:32:25.380 --> 01:32:28.380
I was going to be so insulted by my southern accent.

01:32:28.380 --> 01:32:31.380
I am.

01:32:31.380 --> 01:32:37.380
She's fuming quietly.

01:32:37.380 --> 01:32:38.380
Bonjourno.

01:32:38.380 --> 01:32:39.380
Konichiwa.

01:32:39.380 --> 01:32:41.380
Moshi moshi.

01:32:41.380 --> 01:32:51.380
Are we got to go Zyma?

01:32:51.380 --> 01:32:54.380
I'm carrying.

01:32:54.380 --> 01:32:56.380
What the heck?

01:32:56.380 --> 01:33:01.380
What the heck?

01:33:01.380 --> 01:33:03.380
I can't see.

01:33:03.380 --> 01:33:05.380
There we go.

01:33:05.380 --> 01:33:07.380
Make it stop.

01:33:07.380 --> 01:33:09.380
There we go.

01:33:09.380 --> 01:33:12.380
You haven't loaded back in for me yet.

01:33:12.380 --> 01:33:14.380
It's probably going to take a bit.

01:33:14.380 --> 01:33:16.380
She's coming.

01:33:16.380 --> 01:33:18.380
She came.

01:33:18.380 --> 01:33:20.380
She's here.

01:33:20.380 --> 01:33:23.380
Look at the musical notes.

01:33:23.380 --> 01:33:25.380
They're animated.

01:33:25.380 --> 01:33:27.380
All the mythos girls are.

01:33:27.380 --> 01:33:29.380
Their outfits are also pretty animated.

01:33:29.380 --> 01:33:31.380
I can control her guys.

01:33:31.380 --> 01:33:33.380
Look.

01:33:33.380 --> 01:33:35.380
Look at her feet.

01:33:35.380 --> 01:33:37.380
Hold up.

01:33:37.380 --> 01:33:39.380
I'm making myself big.

01:33:39.380 --> 01:33:42.380
Those are actually some really nice feet.

01:33:42.380 --> 01:33:45.380
They're not weird vtuber feet.

01:33:45.380 --> 01:33:48.380
Some vtubers have weird ass feet.

01:33:48.380 --> 01:33:51.380
You have nice feet.

01:33:52.380 --> 01:33:54.380
Get stuffed on over here.

01:33:54.380 --> 01:33:56.380
Get stuffed on over there.

01:33:56.380 --> 01:33:58.380
I'll put you back.

01:33:58.380 --> 01:34:00.380
I can't stop staring at these toes.

01:34:00.380 --> 01:34:02.380
These are nice.

01:34:12.380 --> 01:34:14.380
Oh my god.

01:34:17.380 --> 01:34:19.380
My mods are going to yell at me later.

01:34:19.380 --> 01:34:21.380
I'm so sorry.

01:34:27.380 --> 01:34:29.380
The grapefruit.

01:34:29.380 --> 01:34:31.380
That's why I learned that technique.

01:34:31.380 --> 01:34:33.380
I learned the grapefruit technique.

01:34:36.380 --> 01:34:38.380
Here we go.

01:34:38.380 --> 01:34:40.380
We're back.

01:34:40.380 --> 01:34:42.380
We're back at it again.

01:34:42.380 --> 01:34:44.380
Back and better than ever.

01:34:44.380 --> 01:34:46.380
I'm being pulled.

01:34:46.380 --> 01:34:48.380
Let's go.

01:34:49.380 --> 01:34:51.380
I'm coming.

01:34:51.380 --> 01:34:53.380
She's coming.

01:34:53.380 --> 01:34:55.380
Yeah?

01:34:55.380 --> 01:34:57.380
I'm being pulled.

01:34:57.380 --> 01:34:59.380
I'm being pulled to victory.

01:34:59.380 --> 01:35:01.380
What just happened?

01:35:01.380 --> 01:35:04.380
I saw the jump and I was like,

01:35:04.380 --> 01:35:06.380
oh shit, I did the same.

01:35:06.380 --> 01:35:08.380
Please.

01:35:08.380 --> 01:35:10.380
Please.

01:35:10.380 --> 01:35:12.380
Oh no.

01:35:12.380 --> 01:35:15.380
We have to literally be super good at this man.

01:35:16.380 --> 01:35:19.380
I'm going to kill myself in Minecraft.

01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:21.380
In Minecraft?

01:35:24.380 --> 01:35:26.380
They were talking about them dogs.

01:35:26.380 --> 01:35:28.380
Yeah, I'm all fucking feed, man.

01:35:28.380 --> 01:35:30.380
They're beautiful.

01:35:30.380 --> 01:35:32.380
Them dogs are barking.

01:35:32.380 --> 01:35:34.380
I got that dog in me.

01:35:36.380 --> 01:35:38.380
My neighbors are probably like,

01:35:38.380 --> 01:35:40.380
what the fuck is going on?

01:35:40.380 --> 01:35:43.380
I'm sure they always think that.

01:35:43.380 --> 01:35:45.380
Not just today.

01:35:46.380 --> 01:35:48.380
Okay, I got it.

01:35:48.380 --> 01:35:50.380
I'm ready.

01:35:50.380 --> 01:35:52.380
I don't know.

01:35:52.380 --> 01:35:55.380
Is chain together carrying my motion sickness right now?

01:35:55.380 --> 01:35:57.380
Wait, whoa.

01:35:59.380 --> 01:36:01.380
I'm trying.

01:36:01.380 --> 01:36:04.380
I could have turned around to pull up.

01:36:08.380 --> 01:36:11.380
Last time, your nieces and nephews were into that.

01:36:11.380 --> 01:36:13.380
Damn bright they are.

01:36:13.380 --> 01:36:15.380
Sweet home out, man.

01:36:15.380 --> 01:36:17.380
Listen, I don't kink shame here.

01:36:17.380 --> 01:36:19.380
You like feet, you like feet.

01:36:19.380 --> 01:36:21.380
That's it.

01:36:21.380 --> 01:36:23.380
I thought we were talking about

01:36:23.380 --> 01:36:25.380
kissing sisters.

01:36:29.380 --> 01:36:31.380
Are you from Mississippi?

01:36:31.380 --> 01:36:33.380
Because you're the only miss who's pissed.

01:36:33.380 --> 01:36:35.380
I'm sippy.

01:36:35.380 --> 01:36:37.380
Okay, baby, I'll get a cup.

01:36:37.380 --> 01:36:39.380
Give me some of that.

01:36:40.380 --> 01:36:42.380
Is that how you piss?

01:36:42.380 --> 01:36:44.380
You just make those noises?

01:36:47.380 --> 01:36:49.380
Sorry, I fucked that up and jumped too early.

01:36:49.380 --> 01:36:51.380
No, we're good, we're good.

01:36:51.380 --> 01:36:53.380
We're good, I got you.

01:36:53.380 --> 01:36:55.380
Yeah, lift me up.

01:36:55.380 --> 01:36:57.380
Up you go.

01:36:57.380 --> 01:36:59.380
You ready?

01:37:01.380 --> 01:37:03.380
Okay, I'm doing it.

01:37:03.380 --> 01:37:06.380
Are we all wearing the same pants?

01:37:06.380 --> 01:37:08.380
Why do we have all the ripped

01:37:08.380 --> 01:37:10.380
golden hole in our butt cheek?

01:37:14.380 --> 01:37:16.380
Go slow.

01:37:16.380 --> 01:37:18.380
I'm sprinting this.

01:37:18.380 --> 01:37:20.380
No, no.

01:37:20.380 --> 01:37:22.380
Slow and steady.

01:37:22.380 --> 01:37:24.380
Easy tap, easy tap.

01:37:24.380 --> 01:37:26.380
Easy clap, easy tap.

01:37:26.380 --> 01:37:28.380
One at a time, jump.

01:37:28.380 --> 01:37:30.380
One at a time.

01:37:30.380 --> 01:37:32.380
Altogether?

01:37:32.380 --> 01:37:34.380
I don't think so.

01:37:34.380 --> 01:37:36.380
Okay, let's do it.

01:37:36.380 --> 01:37:38.380
You don't have to jump.

01:37:38.380 --> 01:37:40.380
You can just fall, by the way.

01:37:40.380 --> 01:37:42.380
No, no, no.

01:37:42.380 --> 01:37:44.380
Okay, okay.

01:37:46.380 --> 01:37:48.380
It's very hard to pull her up

01:37:48.380 --> 01:37:50.380
for some reason.

01:37:50.380 --> 01:37:52.380
I have to be looking down at her.

01:37:52.380 --> 01:37:54.380
Three, two, one.

01:37:54.380 --> 01:37:56.380
Oops.

01:37:56.380 --> 01:37:58.380
We made it, we made it, we made it.

01:37:58.380 --> 01:38:00.380
Going without us, just go, just go.

01:38:00.380 --> 01:38:02.380
Dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit.

01:38:02.380 --> 01:38:04.380
Dammit, dammit, dammit.

01:38:04.380 --> 01:38:06.380
Dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit.

01:38:10.380 --> 01:38:12.380
Oh my god.

01:38:12.380 --> 01:38:14.380
I'm just going to walk on to this.

01:38:14.380 --> 01:38:16.380
I'm so tired.

01:38:16.380 --> 01:38:18.380
Okay, good, okay, next.

01:38:20.380 --> 01:38:22.380
Freak.

01:38:22.380 --> 01:38:24.380
Oh shit, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:38:24.380 --> 01:38:26.380
We got it, we got it, we got it.

01:38:26.380 --> 01:38:28.380
Okay, okay, okay.

01:38:28.380 --> 01:38:30.380
We're going, we're going.

01:38:30.380 --> 01:38:32.380
Dammit, oh snap.

01:38:32.380 --> 01:38:34.380
Yeah, we're so good, we're so good.

01:38:34.380 --> 01:38:36.380
No, we're going.

01:38:36.380 --> 01:38:38.380
Why do I keep fucking jumping?

01:38:38.380 --> 01:38:40.380
That was so early.

01:38:40.380 --> 01:38:42.380
Jump button to jump.

01:38:42.380 --> 01:38:44.380
Okay, hold up, hold up, hold up.

01:38:46.380 --> 01:38:48.380
Hold up, I got to fix him.

01:38:48.380 --> 01:38:50.380
Ah!

01:38:50.380 --> 01:38:52.380
It's fine, you're fine, you're fine.

01:38:52.380 --> 01:38:54.380
We got this, we're going to carry you.

01:38:54.380 --> 01:38:56.380
Oh no.

01:38:56.380 --> 01:38:58.380
We've got you, we can carry you.

01:38:58.380 --> 01:39:00.380
And Kat just hopped on my desk.

01:39:00.380 --> 01:39:02.380
I jumped first, you jumped first.

01:39:02.380 --> 01:39:04.380
I don't know what happened there.

01:39:04.380 --> 01:39:06.380
I didn't see any of us touch it.

01:39:06.380 --> 01:39:08.380
I forgot about the jump.

01:39:08.380 --> 01:39:10.380
I forgot that it existed.

01:39:10.380 --> 01:39:12.380
Where am I going?

01:39:12.380 --> 01:39:14.380
Oh, where are we?

01:39:14.380 --> 01:39:18.380
At the top of the water one again.

01:39:20.380 --> 01:39:22.380
Okay, let's go.

01:39:22.380 --> 01:39:24.380
Okay.

01:39:32.380 --> 01:39:34.380
I didn't press the jump button.

01:39:34.380 --> 01:39:36.380
You just jumped off.

01:39:36.380 --> 01:39:38.380
I didn't press the jump button.

01:39:40.380 --> 01:39:42.380
I just ran off.

01:39:42.380 --> 01:39:44.380
We got this, we got this.

01:39:44.380 --> 01:39:46.380
Oh, I got a piss.

01:39:46.380 --> 01:39:48.380
I got a piss.

01:39:50.380 --> 01:39:52.380
I'm looking at this guy's ass.

01:39:54.380 --> 01:39:56.380
Some fiery ass.

01:39:56.380 --> 01:39:58.380
Don't get distracted by the ass.

01:39:58.380 --> 01:40:00.380
It's very hard not to.

01:40:02.380 --> 01:40:04.380
That's Hell's ass right there.

01:40:06.380 --> 01:40:08.380
Oh, we made it, we made it, we made it.

01:40:08.380 --> 01:40:10.380
Did we?

01:40:10.380 --> 01:40:12.380
Oh god.

01:40:12.380 --> 01:40:14.380
Don't speak so soon.

01:40:14.380 --> 01:40:16.380
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:40:16.380 --> 01:40:18.380
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

01:40:18.380 --> 01:40:20.380
Open up, Haram.

01:40:24.380 --> 01:40:26.380
Is it just me?

01:40:26.380 --> 01:40:28.380
Where did my sound go?

01:40:28.380 --> 01:40:30.380
Oh no.

01:40:30.380 --> 01:40:32.380
Your game sound?

01:40:32.380 --> 01:40:34.380
Oh, it disappeared.

01:40:34.380 --> 01:40:36.380
That's weird.

01:40:36.380 --> 01:40:38.380
Why is Apollo so down?

01:40:38.380 --> 01:40:40.380
Hold on.

01:40:40.380 --> 01:40:42.380
I need to fix Apollo's head.

01:40:42.380 --> 01:40:44.380
It's doing inappropriate things.

01:40:46.380 --> 01:40:48.380
Alright, I brought her back up.

01:40:48.380 --> 01:40:50.380
That's my default height.

01:40:50.380 --> 01:40:52.380
Damn.

01:40:52.380 --> 01:40:54.380
It's a tiny hill.

01:40:54.380 --> 01:40:56.380
I'm tiny.

01:40:56.380 --> 01:40:58.380
I'm in chibi form.

01:40:58.380 --> 01:41:00.380
Oh, that makes more sense then.

01:41:00.380 --> 01:41:02.380
Yeah.

01:41:02.380 --> 01:41:04.380
Oh, I just, what the?

01:41:04.380 --> 01:41:06.380
No, no, no.

01:41:06.380 --> 01:41:08.380
No, no, no.

01:41:08.380 --> 01:41:10.380
No, no, no.

01:41:10.380 --> 01:41:12.380
No, not again.

01:41:16.380 --> 01:41:18.380
Okay, I'm going last.

01:41:18.380 --> 01:41:20.380
Okay.

01:41:20.380 --> 01:41:22.380
Single file.

01:41:22.380 --> 01:41:24.380
Single file line, let's go.

01:41:24.380 --> 01:41:26.380
There's no stuff, we're reconnecting.

01:41:26.380 --> 01:41:28.380
We're reconnecting, no worries.

01:41:28.380 --> 01:41:30.380
Oh wait, what just happened?

01:41:30.380 --> 01:41:32.380
Where'd everybody go?

01:41:32.380 --> 01:41:34.380
Oh wait, did everybody go?

01:41:34.380 --> 01:41:36.380
Yeah, everyone left me.

01:41:36.380 --> 01:41:38.380
Alright, who cares?

01:41:38.380 --> 01:41:40.380
I'm not going to fall.

01:41:40.380 --> 01:41:42.380
I'm just putting my Fuji up.

01:41:42.380 --> 01:41:44.380
Fuji.

01:41:44.380 --> 01:41:46.380
Oh, that's the game.

01:41:46.380 --> 01:41:48.380
I need...

01:41:48.380 --> 01:41:50.380
Hello, thank you so much for following.

01:41:50.380 --> 01:41:52.380
Oh, there's something apparently wrong with steam.

01:41:52.380 --> 01:41:54.380
That makes sense then.

01:41:54.380 --> 01:41:58.380
Why does it news to mess up while we are playing?

01:41:58.380 --> 01:42:00.380
How dare they?

01:42:00.380 --> 01:42:02.380
Believe.

01:42:04.380 --> 01:42:06.380
You're all free now.

01:42:06.380 --> 01:42:08.380
We're not free, we're not free.

01:42:10.380 --> 01:42:12.380
Now I'm just going to be a muppet on your screen,

01:42:12.380 --> 01:42:14.380
so I hope you guys like that.

01:42:20.380 --> 01:42:22.380
Our meds ran out.

01:42:22.380 --> 01:42:24.380
We're just doing it how we are.

01:42:24.380 --> 01:42:26.380
Bye-bye to those leaving.

01:42:26.380 --> 01:42:28.380
Bye.

01:42:28.380 --> 01:42:30.380
I can give you a link.

01:42:30.380 --> 01:42:32.380
It's a really quick setup.

01:42:32.380 --> 01:42:34.380
You just download it.

01:42:34.380 --> 01:42:36.380
Do you want it?

01:42:36.380 --> 01:42:38.380
I can't download something right now.

01:42:38.380 --> 01:42:40.380
We've got to play the game.

01:42:42.380 --> 01:42:44.380
We have priorities.

01:42:44.380 --> 01:42:46.380
That's playing the game.

01:42:48.380 --> 01:42:50.380
How's the game going?

01:42:50.380 --> 01:42:52.380
It's very...

01:42:52.380 --> 01:42:54.380
It's very reminiscent of your name.

01:43:00.380 --> 01:43:02.380
I'll be right back. I hear my cat outside.

01:43:04.380 --> 01:43:06.380
Now let the cat in.

01:43:06.380 --> 01:43:08.380
Let me check on my cat.

01:43:08.380 --> 01:43:10.380
Oh, it's not my cat.

01:43:10.380 --> 01:43:12.380
It's an outside cat that I like feeding every now and then.

01:43:12.380 --> 01:43:14.380
And it cries whenever it wants food.

01:43:14.380 --> 01:43:16.380
So I go out there.

01:43:16.380 --> 01:43:18.380
I'll be right back.

01:43:20.380 --> 01:43:22.380
That's so good.

01:43:22.380 --> 01:43:24.380
What?

01:43:26.380 --> 01:43:28.380
Here, I look for you.

01:43:28.380 --> 01:43:30.380
I give this to you.

01:43:30.380 --> 01:43:32.380
What's up lady?

01:43:32.380 --> 01:43:34.380
What?

01:43:34.380 --> 01:43:36.380
What?

01:43:36.380 --> 01:43:38.380
What?

01:43:38.380 --> 01:43:40.380
What?

01:43:40.380 --> 01:43:42.380
What?

01:43:42.380 --> 01:43:44.380
What?

01:43:44.380 --> 01:43:46.380
What?

01:43:46.380 --> 01:43:48.380
What?

01:43:48.380 --> 01:43:50.380
What?

01:43:50.380 --> 01:43:52.380
I can't just do pictures of everyone.

01:43:52.380 --> 01:43:54.380
That might be easier. Let's see who I have.

01:43:54.380 --> 01:43:56.380
It's pictured here.

01:43:56.380 --> 01:44:00.380
You just use this and then it uses the picture.

01:44:00.380 --> 01:44:02.060
I got a fark discord with you.

01:44:03.860 --> 01:44:05.500
Is this the discord pictures?

01:44:05.500 --> 01:44:06.340
Okay, okay.

01:44:06.340 --> 01:44:09.100
Yeah, it's whatever we put in there.

01:44:09.100 --> 01:44:12.820
It will use whatever we have to open it.

01:44:12.820 --> 01:44:14.380
So you don't have to change anything

01:44:14.380 --> 01:44:16.260
or add anything yourself.

01:44:16.260 --> 01:44:17.900
It will always be in there.

01:44:17.900 --> 01:44:19.420
How do I join with you?

01:44:20.780 --> 01:44:23.980
You just copy the group one.

01:44:23.980 --> 01:44:26.580
Group, got it, got it, got it, got it.

01:44:27.580 --> 01:44:30.620
And then you just add it as browser source.

01:44:30.620 --> 01:44:32.300
Oh my God, it says I have to be using

01:44:32.300 --> 01:44:36.540
the discord desktop app and I don't do that.

01:44:38.300 --> 01:44:39.500
I use it in my browser.

01:44:39.500 --> 01:44:41.660
You do?

01:44:41.660 --> 01:44:44.180
You use the discord browser?

01:44:44.180 --> 01:44:45.140
What'd I do?

01:44:45.140 --> 01:44:46.740
That's funny.

01:44:46.740 --> 01:44:48.060
It's just what I do.

01:44:49.820 --> 01:44:51.220
I can still try to use it.

01:44:51.220 --> 01:44:52.740
I can still try to use it.

01:44:53.740 --> 01:44:55.860
Does it still work though?

01:44:55.860 --> 01:44:56.700
That's weird.

01:45:12.540 --> 01:45:13.700
Is that gonna work?

01:45:16.180 --> 01:45:17.620
I forgot I figured that out.

01:45:17.620 --> 01:45:19.580
I stole this animation from Azura.

01:45:23.060 --> 01:45:23.900
Oh.

01:45:28.260 --> 01:45:30.300
What'd you steal from me?

01:45:30.300 --> 01:45:31.140
Nothing.

01:45:32.180 --> 01:45:33.460
We mean nothing.

01:45:33.460 --> 01:45:34.700
What'd you steal from me?

01:45:34.700 --> 01:45:35.660
What'd you over there looking at?

01:45:35.660 --> 01:45:36.500
Nothing.

01:45:37.820 --> 01:45:39.420
What'd you steal from me?

01:45:39.420 --> 01:45:40.260
Mumble.

01:45:41.460 --> 01:45:44.820
I just copied a certain animation.

01:45:48.180 --> 01:45:51.020
I...

01:45:51.020 --> 01:45:53.260
Um...

01:45:57.020 --> 01:45:59.660
Yeah, this is not working.

01:45:59.660 --> 01:46:01.300
This is not working for me.

01:46:02.540 --> 01:46:05.140
Don't worry about it, we can still play.

01:46:05.140 --> 01:46:05.980
Okay.

01:46:09.100 --> 01:46:10.980
I give up, I couldn't figure it out.

01:46:13.540 --> 01:46:14.380
Okay.

01:46:14.380 --> 01:46:16.260
Maybe if I give you the link,

01:46:16.260 --> 01:46:19.260
can you still use the browser link that I give you?

01:46:19.260 --> 01:46:20.300
Oh, try it.

01:46:20.300 --> 01:46:21.860
We can see if that works.

01:46:25.860 --> 01:46:28.260
Yeah, that's what I tried and it doesn't work.

01:46:28.260 --> 01:46:30.780
It just shows a loading thing forever.

01:46:30.780 --> 01:46:33.100
I couldn't figure out the breath part though.

01:46:35.820 --> 01:46:40.820
The breath part is animated by the person who made it.

01:46:40.820 --> 01:46:42.540
Yeah, I know what you're doing.

01:46:42.540 --> 01:46:44.300
I see you there.

01:46:45.300 --> 01:46:47.660
You're naughty.

01:46:47.660 --> 01:46:49.860
I won't keep my eyes on you.

01:46:50.860 --> 01:46:52.060
Just throw the thumbnail in there.

01:46:52.060 --> 01:46:53.060
Oh, that's a good idea.

01:46:53.060 --> 01:46:54.380
That's a good idea.

01:46:54.380 --> 01:46:55.220
You want it?

01:46:57.020 --> 01:46:58.220
What the thumbnail?

01:46:59.740 --> 01:47:00.940
You want it?

01:47:00.940 --> 01:47:01.780
Don't...

01:47:01.780 --> 01:47:03.340
Why are you saying it like that?

01:47:06.220 --> 01:47:07.660
Yes, mommy, I want it so...

01:47:07.660 --> 01:47:09.220
Mommy, please, mommy.

01:47:11.020 --> 01:47:11.860
What?

01:47:14.300 --> 01:47:15.140
No.

01:47:23.420 --> 01:47:24.860
You're so lucky.

01:47:24.860 --> 01:47:27.620
Why, why, why?

01:47:27.620 --> 01:47:29.220
Why, uh...

01:47:29.220 --> 01:47:31.460
Stam is not working.

01:47:31.460 --> 01:47:33.620
And I'm not on your screen anymore.

01:47:37.020 --> 01:47:39.540
I added a really fun toggle.

01:47:41.420 --> 01:47:42.260
Oh, yeah.

01:47:45.300 --> 01:47:46.340
I added a really fun toggle.

01:47:46.340 --> 01:47:47.820
There, look, I've got everyone.

01:47:47.820 --> 01:47:49.980
Perfect.

01:47:49.980 --> 01:47:53.180
I need to make a toggle where I can take off my shabari ropes.

01:48:00.740 --> 01:48:02.780
There, I've got everyone now.

01:48:07.060 --> 01:48:09.020
You still thumbed out.

01:48:09.020 --> 01:48:10.780
I loved it.

01:48:10.780 --> 01:48:11.860
Yeah, there we go.

01:48:11.860 --> 01:48:13.300
OK, I'm ready, I'm ready.

01:48:15.300 --> 01:48:16.300
It's beautiful.

01:48:19.300 --> 01:48:20.300
It's all of us.

01:48:20.300 --> 01:48:21.300
Absolutely stunning.

01:48:21.300 --> 01:48:22.300
Oh, I love it.

01:48:22.300 --> 01:48:26.300
Oh, I also figured out, I have...

01:48:26.300 --> 01:48:27.300
Where is it?

01:48:27.300 --> 01:48:29.300
I have these eyes.

01:48:29.300 --> 01:48:31.300
And I didn't even know I had them.

01:48:34.300 --> 01:48:36.300
What do you mean you didn't know you had them?

01:48:36.300 --> 01:48:39.300
It didn't show up in any of my toggles.

01:48:39.300 --> 01:48:43.300
I was digging through the toggle files when I got my new tan toggle.

01:48:44.300 --> 01:48:48.300
And I was like, oh, where did this come from?

01:48:50.300 --> 01:48:54.300
I know a lot of them weren't set up as cue lines or even me.

01:48:54.300 --> 01:48:55.300
Yeah.

01:48:55.300 --> 01:48:56.300
Hello, I'm back.

01:48:57.300 --> 01:48:59.300
All right, are we ready?

01:48:59.300 --> 01:49:00.300
Yeah.

01:49:00.300 --> 01:49:01.300
Yeah.

01:49:05.300 --> 01:49:07.300
Yeah, I'm back, I'm back, I'm back.

01:49:07.300 --> 01:49:11.300
Turns out, I thought it was one of the black cats, whiskers.

01:49:11.300 --> 01:49:12.300
I named it whiskers.

01:49:12.300 --> 01:49:13.300
But there's a new cat.

01:49:13.300 --> 01:49:16.300
And I was like, oh, and she's so pretty.

01:49:16.300 --> 01:49:20.300
I was like, oh my God, I want to call you Sapphire.

01:49:21.300 --> 01:49:24.300
I'm basically now feeding nine cats.

01:49:24.300 --> 01:49:25.300
Oh my gosh.

01:49:27.300 --> 01:49:28.300
I'm a cat lady.

01:49:29.300 --> 01:49:30.300
We love it though.

01:49:31.300 --> 01:49:33.300
I aspire to be that level of cat lady.

01:49:34.300 --> 01:49:37.300
My Lord Apollo, leshing guys.

01:49:38.300 --> 01:49:39.300
I love cats, okay?

01:49:40.300 --> 01:49:41.300
Where you going lady?

01:49:41.300 --> 01:49:42.300
Yeah, it's this way.

01:49:42.300 --> 01:49:43.300
Don't go that way.

01:49:43.300 --> 01:49:44.300
She's like, let's go that way.

01:49:44.300 --> 01:49:45.300
Where am I going?

01:49:45.300 --> 01:49:46.300
Where am I going?

01:49:46.300 --> 01:49:47.300
She'll go that way.

01:49:47.300 --> 01:49:48.300
Oh, shit.

01:49:48.300 --> 01:49:49.300
Oh, shit.

01:49:49.300 --> 01:49:50.300
This way.

01:49:50.300 --> 01:49:51.300
Is there, are you ready?

01:49:51.300 --> 01:49:52.300
We're starting.

01:49:52.300 --> 01:49:53.300
We're going, we're going.

01:49:53.300 --> 01:49:54.300
She's not ready.

01:49:54.300 --> 01:49:55.300
Stop.

01:49:58.300 --> 01:50:00.300
Okay, ready, ready, ready, ready.

01:50:00.300 --> 01:50:01.300
Oh, okay.

01:50:02.300 --> 01:50:03.300
I'm very strong.

01:50:07.300 --> 01:50:09.300
Finger action is on point.

01:50:09.300 --> 01:50:11.300
Pinching forward.

01:50:11.300 --> 01:50:12.300
Very carefully.

01:50:12.300 --> 01:50:13.300
Okay.

01:50:15.300 --> 01:50:16.300
Oh.

01:50:23.300 --> 01:50:24.300
Just the, oh.

01:50:27.300 --> 01:50:28.300
Oh my God.

01:50:29.300 --> 01:50:30.300
Wait, what?

01:50:31.300 --> 01:50:32.300
This is not it.

01:50:33.300 --> 01:50:35.300
One at a time pulls the other's weight.

01:50:35.300 --> 01:50:37.300
It makes a lot of noise.

01:50:37.300 --> 01:50:38.300
Yeah.

01:50:38.300 --> 01:50:39.300
Okay.

01:50:41.300 --> 01:50:42.300
Oh my God.

01:50:44.300 --> 01:50:46.300
This is what breaks us, huh?

01:50:47.300 --> 01:50:48.300
Yeah.

01:50:49.300 --> 01:50:50.300
So close to the checkpoint.

01:50:50.300 --> 01:50:52.300
I'm completely mind broken at this point.

01:50:52.300 --> 01:50:54.300
It's a part of the old cat lady.

01:50:54.300 --> 01:50:55.300
Yes.

01:51:04.300 --> 01:51:05.300
What the hell is that?

01:51:05.300 --> 01:51:07.300
Is that you?

01:51:09.300 --> 01:51:10.300
Oh.

01:51:11.300 --> 01:51:13.300
Oh, I made it this time.

01:51:13.300 --> 01:51:14.300
Yay.

01:51:14.300 --> 01:51:15.300
Okay.

01:51:15.300 --> 01:51:16.300
Nice.

01:51:18.300 --> 01:51:20.300
I jump with one.

01:51:23.300 --> 01:51:24.300
Oh.

01:51:24.300 --> 01:51:25.300
Oh my gosh.

01:51:25.300 --> 01:51:26.300
Oh my gosh.

01:51:26.300 --> 01:51:29.300
Sometimes we may jump in like kind of different directions.

01:51:29.300 --> 01:51:30.300
It will gank you.

01:51:30.300 --> 01:51:31.300
So weird.

01:51:31.300 --> 01:51:32.300
Yeah.

01:51:32.300 --> 01:51:34.300
I mean, it's still kind of glitches through.

01:51:34.300 --> 01:51:35.300
So that's, oh my God.

01:51:35.300 --> 01:51:36.300
Yeah.

01:51:36.300 --> 01:51:38.300
Is that you?

01:51:38.300 --> 01:51:40.300
No, that's a circle.

01:51:40.300 --> 01:51:41.300
Oh.

01:51:43.300 --> 01:51:45.300
I would definitely make that noise though.

01:51:45.300 --> 01:51:46.300
Okay.

01:51:46.300 --> 01:51:47.300
Here we go.

01:51:47.300 --> 01:51:48.300
Here we go.

01:51:49.300 --> 01:51:52.300
Let's be careful and carefully make the jump.

01:51:53.300 --> 01:51:54.300
Okay.

01:51:54.300 --> 01:51:55.300
Careful jump.

01:51:55.300 --> 01:51:56.300
Okay, ready?

01:51:56.300 --> 01:51:59.300
One, two, three.

01:52:01.300 --> 01:52:03.300
You guys can, you can just fall onto it.

01:52:04.300 --> 01:52:06.300
I don't know for this one if you can do that though.

01:52:06.300 --> 01:52:08.300
This one we can jump.

01:52:08.300 --> 01:52:10.300
One, two, three.

01:52:10.300 --> 01:52:11.300
Nope, you can't.

01:52:14.300 --> 01:52:15.300
So I figured out you can't.

01:52:28.300 --> 01:52:29.300
Okay.

01:52:29.300 --> 01:52:30.300
Okay.

01:52:31.300 --> 01:52:33.300
I feel like I'm playing Elden Ring.

01:52:35.300 --> 01:52:40.300
I've been waiting this entire time for like a boss monster to come out and do this.

01:52:41.300 --> 01:52:43.300
Totally depressed.

01:52:43.300 --> 01:52:45.300
What is happening?

01:52:45.300 --> 01:52:48.300
I tried to jump and it didn't jump.

01:52:49.300 --> 01:52:50.300
Oh my God.

01:52:51.300 --> 01:52:54.300
Oh, I was not paying attention at all.

01:52:54.300 --> 01:52:55.300
Okay.

01:52:56.300 --> 01:52:59.300
How could this happen to me?

01:52:59.300 --> 01:53:01.300
How could this happen to me?

01:53:01.300 --> 01:53:04.300
I remember seeing me when I said I was worried about you.

01:53:04.300 --> 01:53:05.300
I remember seeing me.

01:53:05.300 --> 01:53:06.300
What?

01:53:06.300 --> 01:53:07.300
What are you saying?

01:53:07.300 --> 01:53:08.300
What?

01:53:08.300 --> 01:53:10.300
No, I didn't hear you.

01:53:10.300 --> 01:53:11.300
What?

01:53:11.300 --> 01:53:16.300
I said remember seeing me and I was worried about you and you're like, I shouldn't have been worried about you.

01:53:16.300 --> 01:53:17.300
That wasn't even me.

01:53:17.300 --> 01:53:19.300
That wasn't even me.

01:53:20.300 --> 01:53:22.300
I'm letting you dangle there for that.

01:53:22.300 --> 01:53:24.300
No, don't pull her up for it.

01:53:24.300 --> 01:53:25.300
Whatever, I'm leaving.

01:53:25.300 --> 01:53:27.300
I'll pull her up so she has to make the jump.

01:53:31.300 --> 01:53:34.300
We were never making it past this point.

01:53:37.300 --> 01:53:39.300
Where the fuck am I?

01:53:42.300 --> 01:53:44.300
He just jumped off.

01:53:44.300 --> 01:53:45.300
Oh, nice.

01:53:48.300 --> 01:53:49.300
Thank you so much for the raid.

01:53:49.300 --> 01:53:50.300
Welcome in.

01:53:50.300 --> 01:53:53.300
Do the lighting change.

01:54:07.300 --> 01:54:09.300
My cat is behind my monitor.

01:54:09.300 --> 01:54:11.300
Reina, why have you betrayed me?

01:54:15.300 --> 01:54:17.300
Okay, this time we've got it.

01:54:17.300 --> 01:54:18.300
This is the one.

01:54:18.300 --> 01:54:19.300
I am the one.

01:54:21.300 --> 01:54:25.300
I didn't touch it.

01:54:25.300 --> 01:54:29.300
I didn't touch it.

01:54:30.300 --> 01:54:33.300
I'm killing myself.

01:54:33.300 --> 01:54:36.300
I'm hanging myself right here.

01:54:39.300 --> 01:54:40.300
Hello.

01:54:40.300 --> 01:54:44.300
Hello and goodbye if you come and left or if you're just coming in.

01:54:44.300 --> 01:54:45.300
Okay, ready?

01:54:45.300 --> 01:54:47.300
Yeah, it's actually Reina this time.

01:54:47.300 --> 01:54:48.300
Go.

01:54:48.300 --> 01:54:49.300
Go, go, go.

01:54:51.300 --> 01:54:52.300
Oh.

01:54:55.300 --> 01:54:56.300
I can't slip and fall.

01:54:56.300 --> 01:54:57.300
No.

01:55:02.300 --> 01:55:05.300
You fucking suck.

01:55:05.300 --> 01:55:07.300
How can you do that?

01:55:07.300 --> 01:55:10.300
You can't slip and fall and I said it and boom.

01:55:14.300 --> 01:55:15.300
It works.

01:55:15.300 --> 01:55:18.300
I didn't see anybody land on that that time.

01:55:18.300 --> 01:55:19.300
That was weird on my screen.

01:55:19.300 --> 01:55:21.300
I think it's never good.

01:55:21.300 --> 01:55:23.300
Never get up.

01:55:23.300 --> 01:55:24.300
Never get up.

01:55:24.300 --> 01:55:25.300
Never get up.

01:55:25.300 --> 01:55:28.300
Speed run, speed run, speed run, speed run.

01:55:28.300 --> 01:55:30.300
Speed run, speed run.

01:55:32.300 --> 01:55:34.300
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:55:34.300 --> 01:55:35.300
Perfect.

01:55:35.300 --> 01:55:36.300
Look to the other side.

01:55:36.300 --> 01:55:37.300
Look to the other side.

01:55:37.300 --> 01:55:38.300
We got this.

01:55:38.300 --> 01:55:39.300
We got this.

01:55:39.300 --> 01:55:40.300
Hello, family.

01:55:40.300 --> 01:55:42.300
You're not alone.

01:55:42.300 --> 01:55:43.300
What?

01:55:43.300 --> 01:55:45.300
Nobody jumped.

01:55:45.300 --> 01:55:47.300
Nobody jumped.

01:55:47.300 --> 01:55:49.300
I was like...

01:55:52.300 --> 01:55:54.300
Oh, hey, we're fine.

01:55:54.300 --> 01:55:55.300
Can I?

01:55:55.300 --> 01:55:58.300
I mean, might as well just go to the checkpoint, man.

01:55:58.300 --> 01:56:00.300
No, no, we don't from here.

01:56:00.300 --> 01:56:01.300
We don't from here.

01:56:01.300 --> 01:56:03.300
And then we go back on the one that we missed.

01:56:05.300 --> 01:56:06.300
It's all right.

01:56:06.300 --> 01:56:07.300
We're good.

01:56:07.300 --> 01:56:08.300
We're good.

01:56:08.300 --> 01:56:09.300
We're good.

01:56:11.300 --> 01:56:13.300
I literally can't pull a Zer up unless I'm looking at her.

01:56:13.300 --> 01:56:14.300
That's so weird.

01:56:14.300 --> 01:56:16.300
So if I'm looking this way, I can't just pull.

01:56:17.300 --> 01:56:20.300
I think you're supposed to be looking at them to pull them.

01:56:20.300 --> 01:56:21.300
I had to...

01:56:21.300 --> 01:56:22.300
Okay, ready?

01:56:22.300 --> 01:56:23.300
Go!

01:56:23.300 --> 01:56:26.300
Why did my space bar not work?

01:56:27.300 --> 01:56:29.300
Oh, hey, we're back.

01:56:30.300 --> 01:56:31.300
Never mind.

01:56:33.300 --> 01:56:34.300
I'm a wizard.

01:56:34.300 --> 01:56:36.300
I'm a wizard, guys.

01:56:36.300 --> 01:56:37.300
Shit.

01:56:37.300 --> 01:56:41.300
I wish to be a wizard right now and inhaling those fumes.

01:56:42.300 --> 01:56:43.300
Go!

01:56:47.300 --> 01:56:50.300
Okay, this is the last one and then I have to go.

01:56:50.300 --> 01:56:51.300
Okay.

01:56:51.300 --> 01:56:54.300
I can only do two hours, but this is the one we're going to make it.

01:56:56.300 --> 01:56:57.300
We're making it.

01:56:57.300 --> 01:56:58.300
We're making it.

01:56:58.300 --> 01:57:00.300
We're making it for one.

01:57:00.300 --> 01:57:01.300
I can feel it.

01:57:03.300 --> 01:57:04.300
Perfect technique.

01:57:04.300 --> 01:57:05.300
Beautiful.

01:57:06.300 --> 01:57:07.300
Ready?

01:57:07.300 --> 01:57:08.300
Ready?

01:57:08.300 --> 01:57:10.300
And jump!

01:57:11.300 --> 01:57:12.300
Ready?

01:57:14.300 --> 01:57:15.300
I was too excited.

01:57:15.300 --> 01:57:16.300
Thank you.

01:57:17.300 --> 01:57:19.300
I'm locked in.

01:57:24.300 --> 01:57:25.300
No.

01:57:25.300 --> 01:57:26.300
Okay, okay, okay.

01:57:27.300 --> 01:57:28.300
Look at that.

01:57:28.300 --> 01:57:31.300
If I save right there, will it be saved?

01:57:31.300 --> 01:57:32.300
No.

01:57:32.300 --> 01:57:34.300
We're going to make the logs.

01:57:34.300 --> 01:57:35.300
Damn.

01:57:35.300 --> 01:57:37.300
Okay, yeah, we've got to make it to the next checkpoint.

01:57:37.300 --> 01:57:38.300
We've got this.

01:57:38.300 --> 01:57:39.300
I can't...

01:57:39.300 --> 01:57:40.300
Oh, hello.

01:57:40.300 --> 01:57:41.300
Thank you so much for the raid.

01:57:41.300 --> 01:57:42.300
Hi.

01:57:42.300 --> 01:57:43.300
Hello.

01:57:45.300 --> 01:57:46.300
Hi.

01:57:50.300 --> 01:57:52.300
Oh, my gosh.

01:57:52.300 --> 01:57:54.300
Okay, this one you can just fall onto.

01:57:54.300 --> 01:57:55.300
Okay.

01:57:55.300 --> 01:57:56.300
Let's try.

01:57:56.300 --> 01:57:57.300
I don't think so.

01:57:57.300 --> 01:57:58.300
It's too far.

01:57:58.300 --> 01:57:59.300
I think you have to do a jump.

01:57:59.300 --> 01:58:01.300
Yeah, you can do a small jump.

01:58:01.300 --> 01:58:02.300
Small jump.

01:58:02.300 --> 01:58:03.300
Oh, no.

01:58:03.300 --> 01:58:04.300
Okay, let me up.

01:58:04.300 --> 01:58:05.300
Is there a...

01:58:05.300 --> 01:58:06.300
Is there a...

01:58:06.300 --> 01:58:08.300
It's because you pulled me down.

01:58:08.300 --> 01:58:10.300
I didn't even fall.

01:58:10.300 --> 01:58:12.300
What are you talking about?

01:58:12.300 --> 01:58:13.300
Oh, so you do fall.

01:58:13.300 --> 01:58:14.300
You do fall.

01:58:14.300 --> 01:58:15.300
Okay.

01:58:15.300 --> 01:58:16.300
You do fall.

01:58:16.300 --> 01:58:17.300
You've got to fall.

01:58:17.300 --> 01:58:18.300
You've got to fall.

01:58:18.300 --> 01:58:19.300
Just fall and then climb.

01:58:19.300 --> 01:58:20.300
Oh, my God.

01:58:20.300 --> 01:58:21.300
Oh, me.

01:58:21.300 --> 01:58:22.300
Okay.

01:58:22.300 --> 01:58:24.300
So it is a fall thing.

01:58:24.300 --> 01:58:26.300
It is a fall thing.

01:58:27.300 --> 01:58:29.300
Okay, I think we figured it out.

01:58:29.300 --> 01:58:30.300
We figured it out.

01:58:30.300 --> 01:58:32.300
No more jumping when we get to the wood part.

01:58:32.300 --> 01:58:35.300
You just fall and then climb.

01:58:35.300 --> 01:58:36.300
Okay, one more.

01:58:36.300 --> 01:58:37.300
This is it.

01:58:37.300 --> 01:58:38.300
This is the one.

01:58:38.300 --> 01:58:39.300
No.

01:58:39.300 --> 01:58:40.300
I'm killing us all.

01:58:40.300 --> 01:58:41.300
Come with me.

01:58:41.300 --> 01:58:42.300
No.

01:58:42.300 --> 01:58:43.300
Come on.

01:58:43.300 --> 01:58:44.300
Death.

01:58:44.300 --> 01:58:45.300
Here we go.

01:58:45.300 --> 01:58:46.300
Death.

01:58:46.300 --> 01:58:47.300
I'm sorry to follow.

01:58:47.300 --> 01:58:48.300
Goodbye.

01:58:48.300 --> 01:58:49.300
No.

01:58:49.300 --> 01:58:53.300
How are you able to pull us all up the one time?

01:58:53.300 --> 01:58:57.300
We're trying to kill ourselves, but then when we're trying to stay on, we all fall.

01:58:57.300 --> 01:58:58.300
I have no idea.

01:58:58.300 --> 01:59:02.300
I think it's because I'm on a flat platform and it's long enough.

01:59:02.300 --> 01:59:03.300
Oh, that makes sense.

01:59:03.300 --> 01:59:04.300
Hey, make a triangle.

01:59:04.300 --> 01:59:06.300
This game is terrible.

01:59:08.300 --> 01:59:09.300
Okay.

01:59:09.300 --> 01:59:10.300
This is it.

01:59:10.300 --> 01:59:11.300
This is the last one.

01:59:11.300 --> 01:59:12.300
This is it.

01:59:12.300 --> 01:59:13.300
This is the last one.

01:59:13.300 --> 01:59:14.300
Okay.

01:59:14.300 --> 01:59:16.300
We're almost at the two hour mark.

01:59:16.300 --> 01:59:18.300
Oh, my God.

01:59:18.300 --> 01:59:20.300
It fell.

01:59:20.300 --> 01:59:22.300
Do not fall.

01:59:22.300 --> 01:59:23.300
We got this.

01:59:23.300 --> 01:59:24.300
We got this.

01:59:24.300 --> 01:59:25.300
We got this.

01:59:25.300 --> 01:59:27.300
Here we go.

01:59:27.300 --> 01:59:28.300
Perfect.

01:59:28.300 --> 01:59:29.300
Oh, we're amazing.

01:59:29.300 --> 01:59:30.300
Okay.

01:59:30.300 --> 01:59:31.300
Okay.

01:59:31.300 --> 01:59:32.300
Okay.

01:59:32.300 --> 01:59:33.300
Okay.

01:59:33.300 --> 01:59:35.300
Ready and jump.

01:59:35.300 --> 01:59:37.300
Oh, my God.

01:59:37.300 --> 01:59:38.300
Okay.

01:59:38.300 --> 01:59:39.300
Okay.

01:59:39.300 --> 01:59:40.300
Okay.

01:59:40.300 --> 01:59:41.300
He saved me.

01:59:41.300 --> 01:59:42.300
He saved me.

01:59:42.300 --> 01:59:43.300
I got too pale.

01:59:43.300 --> 01:59:44.300
I got too orange.

01:59:44.300 --> 01:59:45.300
Okay.

01:59:45.300 --> 01:59:46.300
Over here.

01:59:46.300 --> 01:59:48.300
And jump this way.

01:59:48.300 --> 01:59:49.300
Okay.

01:59:49.300 --> 01:59:54.300
We made it.

01:59:54.300 --> 01:59:55.300
Yeah.

01:59:55.300 --> 01:59:56.300
Apollo.

01:59:56.300 --> 01:59:57.300
Hello.

01:59:57.300 --> 01:59:58.300
Okay.

01:59:58.300 --> 01:59:59.300
Okay.

01:59:59.300 --> 02:00:00.300
No, chunky wide.

02:00:00.300 --> 02:00:01.300
Yay.

02:00:01.300 --> 02:00:02.300
Okay.

02:00:02.300 --> 02:00:05.300
Jump on the first one and just fall on the second.

02:00:05.300 --> 02:00:06.300
Okay.

02:00:06.300 --> 02:00:07.300
I thought it was fall.

02:00:07.300 --> 02:00:09.300
Fall on the first one and jump on both of them.

02:00:09.300 --> 02:00:10.300
Both of them.

02:00:10.300 --> 02:00:11.300
I did fall.

02:00:11.300 --> 02:00:12.300
Okay.

02:00:12.300 --> 02:00:13.300
You can just fall.

02:00:13.300 --> 02:00:14.300
Okay.

02:00:14.300 --> 02:00:15.300
Yeah.

02:00:15.300 --> 02:00:16.300
You want to fall.

02:00:16.300 --> 02:00:17.300
Okay.

02:00:17.300 --> 02:00:18.300
I'm backing up.

02:00:18.300 --> 02:00:19.300
Shit.

02:00:19.300 --> 02:00:21.300
I couldn't make it back to the platform.

02:00:21.300 --> 02:00:23.300
I was trying to back up to the platform.

02:00:23.300 --> 02:00:24.300
Okay.

02:00:24.300 --> 02:00:29.300
I don't know why I fell and then I clicked like space bar to climb up.

02:00:29.300 --> 02:00:30.300
God.

02:00:30.300 --> 02:00:31.300
Okay.

02:00:31.300 --> 02:00:32.300
That was not the one.

02:00:32.300 --> 02:00:33.300
That was not the one.

02:00:33.300 --> 02:00:34.300
I'm killing us.

02:00:34.300 --> 02:00:35.300
Damn it.

02:00:35.300 --> 02:00:36.300
I'm killing us.

02:00:36.300 --> 02:00:37.300
Come here.

02:00:37.300 --> 02:00:38.300
No, we're killing us.

02:00:38.300 --> 02:00:39.300
It's over.

02:00:39.300 --> 02:00:40.300
It's done.

02:00:40.300 --> 02:00:41.300
It's over.

02:00:41.300 --> 02:00:42.300
It's over.

02:00:42.300 --> 02:00:43.300
It's over.

02:00:43.300 --> 02:00:44.300
It's over.

02:00:44.300 --> 02:00:45.300
It's over.

02:00:45.300 --> 02:00:46.300
It's over.

02:00:46.300 --> 02:00:47.300
It's over.

02:00:47.300 --> 02:00:48.300
It's over.

02:00:48.300 --> 02:00:49.300
It's over.

02:00:49.300 --> 02:00:50.300
It's over.

02:00:50.300 --> 02:00:51.300
It's over.

02:00:51.300 --> 02:00:52.300
It's over.

02:00:52.300 --> 02:00:53.300
It's over.

02:00:53.300 --> 02:00:54.300
It's over.

02:00:54.300 --> 02:00:55.300
It's over.

02:00:55.300 --> 02:00:56.300
It's over.

02:00:56.300 --> 02:00:57.300
It's over.

02:00:57.300 --> 02:00:58.300
It's over.

02:00:58.300 --> 02:00:59.300
It's over.

02:00:59.300 --> 02:01:00.300
It's over.

02:01:00.300 --> 02:01:01.300
That's happening here.

02:01:01.300 --> 02:01:02.300
It's a game.

02:01:02.300 --> 02:01:03.300
We can end here.

02:01:03.300 --> 02:01:04.300
We can end here.

02:01:04.300 --> 02:01:05.300
Okay.

02:01:05.300 --> 02:01:07.300
Thank you so much for having me, guys.

02:01:07.300 --> 02:01:08.300
I had so much fun

02:01:08.300 --> 02:01:09.300
and I lost so much sanity.

02:01:09.300 --> 02:01:10.300
I don't ever want to play this game again.

02:01:10.300 --> 02:01:11.300
I did have a lot of fun.

02:01:11.300 --> 02:01:12.300
This.

02:01:12.300 --> 02:01:13.300
This was fun.

02:01:13.300 --> 02:01:14.300
Oh, this was good.

02:01:14.300 --> 02:01:15.300
I'm out of lunch, mom.

02:01:15.300 --> 02:01:16.300
I didn't play this as straw.

02:01:16.300 --> 02:01:17.300
This would be fun to play as straw.

02:01:17.300 --> 02:01:18.300
They're her Scottish rage.

02:01:18.300 --> 02:01:19.300
Good luck.

02:01:19.300 --> 02:01:20.300
Good luck.

02:01:20.300 --> 02:01:23.540
take bets on who's gonna throw up first when you're playing this when you're

02:01:23.540 --> 02:01:29.140
drunk. Oh my god. Azora, I'm putting my bets on you.

02:01:29.140 --> 02:01:32.300
Well, me. I'm gonna play with you first.

02:01:35.300 --> 02:01:37.300
Yeah, I think so. How are we dying?

02:01:37.300 --> 02:01:39.300
Yes, damn it.

02:01:39.300 --> 02:01:41.300
You're slowly trying to kill us, sir.

02:01:41.300 --> 02:01:44.300
No.

02:01:44.300 --> 02:01:47.300
Let me die. Let me die.

02:01:47.300 --> 02:01:50.300
I'm ending it. Why am I on top of that?

02:01:50.300 --> 02:01:52.300
Thank you.

02:02:02.300 --> 02:02:05.300
Oh, now they want to die. No, I'm not letting it happen.

02:02:05.300 --> 02:02:07.300
I'm not letting this happen.

02:02:07.300 --> 02:02:10.300
No, I get to die in our own terms.

02:02:10.300 --> 02:02:13.300
It's my terms we get to die on.

02:02:18.300 --> 02:02:20.300
Wee.

02:02:25.300 --> 02:02:28.300
Wee. This is actually nice.

02:02:28.300 --> 02:02:30.300
This is pretty nice.

02:02:32.300 --> 02:02:35.300
Oh, fuck. Get me out of here. Get me out of here.

02:02:35.300 --> 02:02:37.300
Get me out of here. Get me out of here.

02:02:37.300 --> 02:02:39.300
Get me out of here.

02:02:41.300 --> 02:02:43.300
Oh my god. I'm leaving.

02:02:43.300 --> 02:02:45.300
Leaving the game.

02:02:46.300 --> 02:02:48.300
Get me out of here.

02:02:49.300 --> 02:02:51.300
I'm still on the call.

02:02:52.300 --> 02:02:55.300
Why am I all the way down here?

02:03:02.300 --> 02:03:05.300
Let me turn that down a little bit.

02:03:05.300 --> 02:03:07.300
Hey.

02:03:08.300 --> 02:03:11.300
Did you guys enjoy?

02:03:15.300 --> 02:03:18.300
That was fun. I actually like that game a lot.

02:03:18.300 --> 02:03:21.300
I definitely want to play it with Stradi.

02:03:21.300 --> 02:03:24.300
It was going to be so funny. I miss you guys too.

02:03:24.300 --> 02:03:26.300
I miss you guys so much.

02:03:26.300 --> 02:03:29.300
Did you guys like my little surprise?

02:03:29.300 --> 02:03:31.300
Yeah, blue.

02:03:31.300 --> 02:03:33.300
Yeah, blue.

02:03:33.300 --> 02:03:36.300
Did you guys like my little surprise?

02:03:36.300 --> 02:03:38.300
Yeah, blue.

02:03:38.300 --> 02:03:41.300
And then you got tan toggle.

02:03:41.300 --> 02:03:44.300
Although I kind of go blackface for a second.

02:03:44.300 --> 02:03:47.300
Sometimes it happens. Sometimes it doesn't.

02:03:52.300 --> 02:03:54.300
Yeah, see that time I didn't do it.

02:03:54.300 --> 02:03:56.300
It's funny.

02:03:56.300 --> 02:03:58.300
I locked my true form.

02:03:58.300 --> 02:04:00.300
Yeah, I'll be honest with you.

02:04:00.300 --> 02:04:02.300
So normally it looks like this

02:04:02.300 --> 02:04:04.300
and I don't like the colors

02:04:04.300 --> 02:04:06.300
because I just look like a red orc.

02:04:06.300 --> 02:04:08.300
So I fixed it myself.

02:04:08.300 --> 02:04:10.300
I'm like, this isn't tan. This is red.

02:04:10.300 --> 02:04:12.300
But it colored my ears the way I wanted.

02:04:12.300 --> 02:04:14.300
So because I'm...

02:04:15.300 --> 02:04:17.300
This looks like I have a sunburn.

02:04:18.300 --> 02:04:20.300
Yeah, it looks so red.

02:04:20.300 --> 02:04:22.300
So I asked for less red undertones.

02:04:22.300 --> 02:04:24.300
But I was just like, whatever, I'll do it myself.

02:04:25.300 --> 02:04:27.300
I'll do it myself.

02:04:28.300 --> 02:04:30.300
And then I have my cover up coming.

02:04:30.300 --> 02:04:32.300
I actually like it with the red eyes.

02:04:32.300 --> 02:04:34.300
I thought I would like it with the blue eyes more.

02:04:34.300 --> 02:04:36.300
But I like it with the red eyes.

02:04:40.300 --> 02:04:42.300
Now we just need tan lines.

02:04:42.300 --> 02:04:44.300
Oh yeah, where all my shabari is.

02:04:44.300 --> 02:04:46.300
I could actually probably do that

02:04:46.300 --> 02:04:48.300
and make my shabari...

02:04:48.300 --> 02:04:50.300
Like initially my shabari was lighter.

02:04:50.300 --> 02:04:52.300
The shadows because of the underlying part of the model.

02:04:52.300 --> 02:04:54.300
I don't know if you guys noticed,

02:04:54.300 --> 02:04:56.300
my hair color changes too.

02:04:56.300 --> 02:04:58.300
And I change the toggle.

02:04:58.300 --> 02:05:00.300
My hair gets lighter.

02:05:01.300 --> 02:05:02.300
Because it looks...

02:05:02.300 --> 02:05:04.300
I think it looks a little bit better

02:05:04.300 --> 02:05:06.300
with lighter blonde hair.

02:05:06.300 --> 02:05:08.300
I'm a sucker for white hair and dark skin.

02:05:08.300 --> 02:05:10.300
I'll be honest with you.

02:05:10.300 --> 02:05:12.300
Although this is a little bit darker than I am.

02:05:12.300 --> 02:05:13.300
But I like...

02:05:13.300 --> 02:05:15.300
I probably would be more of a Zura's color

02:05:15.300 --> 02:05:17.300
and then she would be more of my color.

02:05:17.300 --> 02:05:19.300
But you know, we can always figure that out.

02:05:22.300 --> 02:05:24.300
Strawberry blond.

02:05:24.300 --> 02:05:26.300
Look at that, I just dye my hair.

02:05:28.300 --> 02:05:30.300
That's Madam Secret.

02:05:30.300 --> 02:05:32.300
I dye my hair...

02:05:32.300 --> 02:05:34.300
red at the ends.

02:05:35.300 --> 02:05:37.300
Don't tell anyone.

02:05:38.300 --> 02:05:41.300
I'm naturally just normally blonde.

02:05:42.300 --> 02:05:45.300
I'm a freaking Valyrian from House of the Dragon.

02:05:45.300 --> 02:05:47.300
But let's talk.

02:05:47.300 --> 02:05:49.300
How are you guys doing?

02:05:49.300 --> 02:05:51.300
How are you guys feeling?

02:05:51.300 --> 02:05:53.300
Let me look at my donos and stuff.

02:05:53.300 --> 02:05:55.300
I wanted to give you guys more attention

02:05:55.300 --> 02:05:57.300
for my first stream back.

02:05:57.300 --> 02:05:59.300
But I wasn't able to do that.

02:05:59.300 --> 02:06:01.300
So I apologize.

02:06:01.300 --> 02:06:03.300
Let's see.

02:06:03.300 --> 02:06:05.300
Thank you guys for all the remembers.

02:06:05.300 --> 02:06:07.300
That's so nice.

02:06:07.300 --> 02:06:09.300
I saw it like this.

02:06:09.300 --> 02:06:11.300
I figured out what we're doing

02:06:11.300 --> 02:06:13.300
for the monthly.

02:06:13.300 --> 02:06:15.300
I'm not telling you yet.

02:06:15.300 --> 02:06:17.300
Hee hee hee.

02:06:19.300 --> 02:06:21.300
Thank you Grumbo for the $50 tip.

02:06:21.300 --> 02:06:23.300
I can't stay for your return stream.

02:06:23.300 --> 02:06:25.300
Take this and feel better.

02:06:25.300 --> 02:06:27.300
That sounds so bad.

02:06:27.300 --> 02:06:29.300
Take my money.

02:06:29.300 --> 02:06:31.300
Feel better.

02:06:31.300 --> 02:06:33.300
I actually feel...

02:06:33.300 --> 02:06:35.300
Somebody in my Twitter comments recommended

02:06:35.300 --> 02:06:37.300
this thing called Vertagon.

02:06:37.300 --> 02:06:39.300
That they said that they're family member use.

02:06:39.300 --> 02:06:41.300
So I'm like fuck it.

02:06:41.300 --> 02:06:43.300
And I bought it on Amazon.

02:06:43.300 --> 02:06:45.300
And it's actually really good.

02:06:45.300 --> 02:06:47.300
I feel a lot better after only taking one pill.

02:06:47.300 --> 02:06:49.300
It's like a little supplement.

02:06:49.300 --> 02:06:51.300
I was falling over myself

02:06:51.300 --> 02:06:53.300
at the grocery store with my mom.

02:06:53.300 --> 02:06:55.300
She had to study me a couple of times.

02:06:55.300 --> 02:06:57.300
I keep making myself bigger.

02:06:57.300 --> 02:06:59.300
Thank you for the remembers.

02:06:59.300 --> 02:07:01.300
I'm going to call them remembers.

02:07:01.300 --> 02:07:03.300
Reherums.

02:07:03.300 --> 02:07:05.300
R-X-S-E-J.

02:07:05.300 --> 02:07:07.300
Thank you Mr. Black.

02:07:07.300 --> 02:07:09.300
Silence. Appreciate you guys.

02:07:09.300 --> 02:07:11.300
I miss you guys a lot.

02:07:11.300 --> 02:07:13.300
Let me...

02:07:13.300 --> 02:07:15.300
What the heck's going on in my stream?

02:07:15.300 --> 02:07:17.300
It's like showing me stuff from like five minutes ago.

02:07:19.300 --> 02:07:21.300
You look amazing as always.

02:07:21.300 --> 02:07:23.300
Thank you darling.

02:07:23.300 --> 02:07:25.300
Thank you.

02:07:25.300 --> 02:07:27.300
Yeah, I don't know if...

02:07:27.300 --> 02:07:29.300
I wonder if people

02:07:29.300 --> 02:07:31.300
will be mad that I'm brown

02:07:31.300 --> 02:07:33.300
or like...

02:07:33.300 --> 02:07:35.300
Although it's funny because when I do my toggles

02:07:35.300 --> 02:07:37.300
I forgot...

02:07:49.300 --> 02:07:51.300
So that's top audio was muted.

02:07:51.300 --> 02:07:53.300
But oh my goodness.

02:07:53.300 --> 02:07:55.300
What the hell?

02:07:55.300 --> 02:07:57.300
Um...

02:07:57.300 --> 02:07:59.300
Uh...

02:07:59.300 --> 02:08:01.300
Thank you Doki.

02:08:01.300 --> 02:08:03.300
For the two hundo.

02:08:03.300 --> 02:08:05.300
That was...

02:08:05.300 --> 02:08:07.300
I didn't expect that.

02:08:07.300 --> 02:08:09.300
Why are you guys so nice to me?

02:08:09.300 --> 02:08:11.300
I don't understand.

02:08:11.300 --> 02:08:13.300
I don't deserve this.

02:08:13.300 --> 02:08:15.300
Stop!

02:08:15.300 --> 02:08:17.300
I'm tired.

02:08:17.300 --> 02:08:19.300
Don't give me your money.

02:08:19.300 --> 02:08:21.300
Oh...

02:08:21.300 --> 02:08:23.300
I miss my hundo so much.

02:08:23.300 --> 02:08:25.300
Toggle is beautiful.

02:08:25.300 --> 02:08:27.300
I'm so happy to see you streaming it.

02:08:27.300 --> 02:08:29.300
I know. I'm so glad to be back.

02:08:29.300 --> 02:08:31.300
I was dying.

02:08:31.300 --> 02:08:33.300
I was going to stream again this morning.

02:08:33.300 --> 02:08:35.300
Um...

02:08:35.300 --> 02:08:37.300
Just for us.

02:08:37.300 --> 02:08:39.300
My mom was like, oh, let's take you to the grocery store.

02:08:39.300 --> 02:08:41.300
So I like...

02:08:41.300 --> 02:08:43.300
Didn't do that. And then my mom's like, oh, I'm going to be late.

02:08:43.300 --> 02:08:45.300
And I'm like, great.

02:08:45.300 --> 02:08:47.300
I'm just strafing mom.

02:08:47.300 --> 02:08:49.300
What the hell, mother?

02:08:49.300 --> 02:08:51.300
Um...

02:08:51.300 --> 02:08:53.300
But she says hi. She says...

02:08:53.300 --> 02:08:55.300
She's very thankful you guys have been taking care of me.

02:08:55.300 --> 02:08:57.300
Because I was telling you guys...

02:08:57.300 --> 02:08:59.300
Telling her about that you guys got me like...

02:08:59.300 --> 02:09:01.300
So my mom's like, oh, do you need any like...

02:09:01.300 --> 02:09:03.300
Um...

02:09:03.300 --> 02:09:05.300
Gatorade? I'm like, sorry.

02:09:05.300 --> 02:09:07.300
They bought me PDLI.

02:09:07.300 --> 02:09:09.300
And my mom's like, oh, do you need this?

02:09:09.300 --> 02:09:11.300
I'm like, oh, they bought me curtains.

02:09:11.300 --> 02:09:13.300
She's like, what the hell?

02:09:13.300 --> 02:09:15.300
And I'm like, I don't...

02:09:15.300 --> 02:09:17.300
I don't know what they do to deserve it.

02:09:17.300 --> 02:09:19.300
They're just so kind to me.

02:09:19.300 --> 02:09:21.300
And I love it. And I appreciate it.

02:09:21.300 --> 02:09:23.300
Yeah, I got some groceries.

02:09:23.300 --> 02:09:25.300
I spent quite a bit of change on groceries.

02:09:25.300 --> 02:09:27.300
But...

02:09:27.300 --> 02:09:29.300
Definitely I hadn't gone grocery shopping in like...

02:09:29.300 --> 02:09:31.300
Two months.

02:09:31.300 --> 02:09:33.300
I would get...

02:09:33.300 --> 02:09:35.300
A few things here or there.

02:09:35.300 --> 02:09:37.300
But I just never like actually went full on grocery shopping.

02:09:37.300 --> 02:09:39.300
I got a crustables.

02:09:39.300 --> 02:09:41.300
Although I forgot to...

02:09:41.300 --> 02:09:45.300
Get some things. So I need to run to the store tomorrow, probably.

02:09:45.300 --> 02:09:47.300
She didn't even pay for it, literally.

02:09:47.300 --> 02:09:49.300
I was just like talking to her.

02:09:49.300 --> 02:09:51.300
I'm like, yeah, I finally got the um...

02:09:51.300 --> 02:09:53.300
Little set for the balcony that I wanted.

02:09:53.300 --> 02:09:55.300
The patio set.

02:09:55.300 --> 02:09:57.300
My mom's like, oh, that's nice.

02:09:57.300 --> 02:09:59.300
And I'm like, oh, yeah, harem got that for me.

02:09:59.300 --> 02:10:01.300
And she's just like...

02:10:01.300 --> 02:10:03.300
What?

02:10:03.300 --> 02:10:05.300
And I'm like, yeah, she's like...

02:10:05.300 --> 02:10:07.300
Cheebie, that was a lot of money.

02:10:07.300 --> 02:10:09.300
And I'm like, I don't know what the...

02:10:09.300 --> 02:10:11.300
She's like...

02:10:11.300 --> 02:10:13.300
Are you sure it's only audio you're doing?

02:10:13.300 --> 02:10:15.300
I'm like, mom.

02:10:15.300 --> 02:10:17.300
I'm only doing audio.

02:10:19.300 --> 02:10:21.300
Incrustables tier list stream?

02:10:21.300 --> 02:10:23.300
Oh, yeah, I should probably do that.

02:10:23.300 --> 02:10:25.300
That'd be a good idea.

02:10:25.300 --> 02:10:27.300
Whoo!

02:10:27.300 --> 02:10:29.300
So eepy.

02:10:29.300 --> 02:10:31.300
Although I slept a couple of times today,

02:10:31.300 --> 02:10:33.300
but I was kind of off and on...

02:10:33.300 --> 02:10:35.300
A week since...

02:10:35.300 --> 02:10:37.300
What's it called?

02:10:37.300 --> 02:10:39.300
What's it called?

02:10:39.300 --> 02:10:41.300
Since this morning.

02:10:41.300 --> 02:10:43.300
Let me fix my freaking eyeballs.

02:10:43.300 --> 02:10:45.300
But thank you so much, Doki.

02:10:45.300 --> 02:10:47.300
Does Mama Cotton Bomb want anything?

02:10:47.300 --> 02:10:49.300
Mama Cotton...

02:10:49.300 --> 02:10:51.300
I was gonna buy her...

02:10:51.300 --> 02:10:53.300
Because she got some groceries too while she was with me.

02:10:53.300 --> 02:10:55.300
And I was gonna buy her groceries for her.

02:10:55.300 --> 02:10:57.300
My mom is a very proud woman

02:10:57.300 --> 02:10:59.300
and she doesn't like taking things.

02:10:59.300 --> 02:11:01.300
And she's just like...

02:11:01.300 --> 02:11:03.300
I feel weird you buying my groceries,

02:11:03.300 --> 02:11:05.300
so I'm buying for my own.

02:11:05.300 --> 02:11:07.300
You literally don't have a job right now,

02:11:07.300 --> 02:11:09.300
and you've taken care of me my entire life,

02:11:09.300 --> 02:11:11.300
so let me just take care of you.

02:11:11.300 --> 02:11:13.300
And she's still refused.

02:11:13.300 --> 02:11:15.300
Um...

02:11:15.300 --> 02:11:17.300
My dad...

02:11:17.300 --> 02:11:19.300
My mom, like, ridiculed my dad

02:11:19.300 --> 02:11:21.300
because she's just like, well, you know how your dad is.

02:11:21.300 --> 02:11:23.300
He's always asking you to buy him takeout

02:11:23.300 --> 02:11:25.300
and get him that expensive bourbon.

02:11:25.300 --> 02:11:27.300
She's like, that's fine.

02:11:27.300 --> 02:11:29.300
And I'm like, oh my god.

02:11:29.300 --> 02:11:31.300
She's...

02:11:31.300 --> 02:11:33.300
My mom's just not like that.

02:11:33.300 --> 02:11:35.300
She's worked hard for everything,

02:11:35.300 --> 02:11:37.300
so she's very proud like that.

02:11:37.300 --> 02:11:39.300
That's... I aim to be just like her.

02:11:39.300 --> 02:11:41.300
And my dad's like, oh!

02:11:41.300 --> 02:11:43.300
My dad calls you my minions.

02:11:43.300 --> 02:11:45.300
He's like,

02:11:45.300 --> 02:11:47.300
so your minions get the hook up?

02:11:47.300 --> 02:11:49.300
Can they get me that bourbon?

02:11:49.300 --> 02:11:51.300
I'm like, dad, that bourbon was $2,000.

02:11:51.300 --> 02:11:53.300
I finally looked at the price.

02:11:53.300 --> 02:11:55.300
I didn't look up the price before,

02:11:55.300 --> 02:11:57.300
and I'm like, you wanted my people

02:11:57.300 --> 02:11:59.300
to buy a $2,000 bottle for you?

02:11:59.300 --> 02:12:01.300
No!

02:12:01.300 --> 02:12:03.300
That's just so fine!

02:12:03.300 --> 02:12:05.300
He's like, I don't know.

02:12:05.300 --> 02:12:07.300
I didn't know the type of money you were making.

02:12:07.300 --> 02:12:09.300
I don't know. I don't know.

02:12:09.300 --> 02:12:11.300
And I'm like, dad.

02:12:11.300 --> 02:12:13.300
No, I'm not going to ask them to do that.

02:12:13.300 --> 02:12:15.300
I'm like, you haven't even come on the stream yet

02:12:15.300 --> 02:12:17.300
and you expect them to catch you.

02:12:17.300 --> 02:12:19.300
He's like, okay, you're right.

02:12:23.300 --> 02:12:25.300
I'm doing okay.

02:12:25.300 --> 02:12:27.300
I'm still a little dizzy.

02:12:27.300 --> 02:12:29.300
Actually, that stream wasn't as bad as I thought it would be

02:12:29.300 --> 02:12:31.300
in terms of my dizziness.

02:12:31.300 --> 02:12:33.300
But I woke up fine this morning

02:12:33.300 --> 02:12:35.300
and I'm like, oh, yeah, it's probably gone.

02:12:35.300 --> 02:12:37.300
And then as I kind of move throughout the day,

02:12:37.300 --> 02:12:39.300
if I move too much,

02:12:39.300 --> 02:12:41.300
if I move my head, I get dizzy.

02:12:41.300 --> 02:12:43.300
So I think because I'm just moving my eyes

02:12:43.300 --> 02:12:45.300
and I'm not moving my head,

02:12:45.300 --> 02:12:47.300
because I'm not turning my head to look at the screen,

02:12:47.300 --> 02:12:49.300
I'm just using my eyes,

02:12:49.300 --> 02:12:51.300
then it makes it a lot easier.

02:12:51.300 --> 02:12:53.300
Although, when I was doing this

02:12:53.300 --> 02:12:55.300
as a joke a couple of times,

02:12:55.300 --> 02:12:57.300
I was like, whoa!

02:12:57.300 --> 02:12:59.300
How's Fia doing?

02:12:59.300 --> 02:13:01.300
So it seems like Fia has...

02:13:01.300 --> 02:13:03.300
So if you don't know, let me explain

02:13:03.300 --> 02:13:05.300
what's going on with Fia.

02:13:05.300 --> 02:13:07.300
So Fia is my cat.

02:13:07.300 --> 02:13:09.300
She is a little over a year old.

02:13:09.300 --> 02:13:11.300
She's like a year and a month or two.

02:13:11.300 --> 02:13:13.300
She is my female...

02:13:13.300 --> 02:13:15.300
One of my female classmates cat.

02:13:15.300 --> 02:13:17.300
She's adorable.

02:13:17.300 --> 02:13:19.300
This past March,

02:13:19.300 --> 02:13:21.300
randomly,

02:13:21.300 --> 02:13:23.300
I was...

02:13:23.300 --> 02:13:25.300
This has happened during my PL

02:13:25.300 --> 02:13:27.300
my past life,

02:13:27.300 --> 02:13:29.300
as Rina.

02:13:29.300 --> 02:13:31.300
She

02:13:31.300 --> 02:13:33.300
randomly,

02:13:33.300 --> 02:13:35.300
the day of one of my

02:13:35.300 --> 02:13:37.300
birthday event,

02:13:37.300 --> 02:13:39.300
she randomly couldn't walk,

02:13:39.300 --> 02:13:41.300
so I had to cancel it.

02:13:41.300 --> 02:13:43.300
And I was wondering,

02:13:43.300 --> 02:13:45.300
she was plopping her feet

02:13:45.300 --> 02:13:47.300
and she couldn't pick up her back legs.

02:13:47.300 --> 02:13:49.300
So we literally did

02:13:49.300 --> 02:13:51.300
so many X-rays and scans

02:13:51.300 --> 02:13:53.300
and ultrasounds.

02:13:53.300 --> 02:13:55.300
I don't know if she had a surgery

02:13:55.300 --> 02:13:57.300
or if she had a neurological issue.

02:13:57.300 --> 02:13:59.300
No, she's totally fine.

02:13:59.300 --> 02:14:01.300
They literally couldn't find anything wrong with her.

02:14:01.300 --> 02:14:03.300
They have no idea. They did blood work.

02:14:03.300 --> 02:14:05.300
All her blood work came back normal.

02:14:05.300 --> 02:14:07.300
But she couldn't walk.

02:14:07.300 --> 02:14:09.300
She couldn't move her back legs.

02:14:09.300 --> 02:14:11.300
And then eventually it became her front legs.

02:14:11.300 --> 02:14:13.300
And then she couldn't move her body or her tail.

02:14:13.300 --> 02:14:15.300
So she was literally just paralyzed.

02:14:15.300 --> 02:14:17.300
And I had to bring her to the bathroom.

02:14:17.300 --> 02:14:19.300
There's like a clip someone took of me.

02:14:19.300 --> 02:14:21.300
And I'm like, sorry,

02:14:21.300 --> 02:14:23.300
so she can shit because she couldn't posture.

02:14:25.300 --> 02:14:27.300
And I would carry...

02:14:27.300 --> 02:14:29.300
Fiya's very good at communicating.

02:14:29.300 --> 02:14:31.300
So she has a little bed that I would put her in

02:14:31.300 --> 02:14:33.300
and I would just carry her around the bed

02:14:33.300 --> 02:14:35.300
and I'd bring over her litter box.

02:14:35.300 --> 02:14:37.300
She meow, no.

02:14:37.300 --> 02:14:39.300
Or I'd bring her over to the food and she wouldn't meow.

02:14:39.300 --> 02:14:41.300
So that means I just set her down so she wants to eat.

02:14:41.300 --> 02:14:43.300
So she was very good at telling me what she wanted.

02:14:43.300 --> 02:14:45.300
I gave her medication every day.

02:14:45.300 --> 02:14:47.300
She was on three different medications.

02:14:47.300 --> 02:14:49.300
And finally,

02:14:49.300 --> 02:14:51.300
when she got her on an antibiotic,

02:14:51.300 --> 02:14:53.300
she saw a plethora of doctors,

02:14:53.300 --> 02:14:55.300
thousands of dollars in vet bills

02:14:55.300 --> 02:14:57.300
that I'm still trying to pay off.

02:14:59.300 --> 02:15:01.300
Yes, for a month,

02:15:01.300 --> 02:15:03.300
almost three months,

02:15:03.300 --> 02:15:05.300
I was literally waiting on her hand and foot.

02:15:05.300 --> 02:15:07.300
I was another reason why I went on a mental leave

02:15:07.300 --> 02:15:09.300
because I couldn't take the toll

02:15:09.300 --> 02:15:11.300
because she hadn't even turned a year yet

02:15:11.300 --> 02:15:13.300
and I thought I was going to have to put my cat down.

02:15:13.300 --> 02:15:15.300
So it was really tough.

02:15:15.300 --> 02:15:17.300
And I love her to death.

02:15:17.300 --> 02:15:19.300
I just want her to fucking live to her first year.

02:15:19.300 --> 02:15:21.300
That's all I want.

02:15:21.300 --> 02:15:23.300
And then when I was

02:15:23.300 --> 02:15:25.300
accepted to be a lawyer, I literally was like,

02:15:25.300 --> 02:15:27.300
oh my god, thank you fucking,

02:15:27.300 --> 02:15:29.300
thank you universe for this.

02:15:29.300 --> 02:15:31.300
And then,

02:15:31.300 --> 02:15:33.300
Stroni was just like, I'll pay for stuff.

02:15:33.300 --> 02:15:35.300
I'll do this, I'll do that.

02:15:35.300 --> 02:15:37.300
I was like, nah, but she did help me

02:15:37.300 --> 02:15:39.300
with a bill.

02:15:39.300 --> 02:15:41.300
So I've already paid her back.

02:15:41.300 --> 02:15:43.300
But I was just very appreciative

02:15:43.300 --> 02:15:45.300
of that.

02:15:45.300 --> 02:15:47.300
And it's happening again.

02:15:47.300 --> 02:15:49.300
She can't move her back legs.

02:15:49.300 --> 02:15:51.300
So her body is slowly just

02:15:51.300 --> 02:15:53.300
not being able to

02:15:53.300 --> 02:15:55.300
support her.

02:15:55.300 --> 02:15:57.300
So she can't walk.

02:15:57.300 --> 02:15:59.300
She'll try, she'll like kind of drag herself

02:15:59.300 --> 02:16:01.300
towards me

02:16:01.300 --> 02:16:03.300
because she wants to be picked up.

02:16:03.300 --> 02:16:05.300
That's why I get the big stretch

02:16:05.300 --> 02:16:07.300
because I would have to do physical therapy

02:16:07.300 --> 02:16:09.300
because her muscles started to atrophy

02:16:09.300 --> 02:16:11.300
because she didn't move for like a month and a half.

02:16:11.300 --> 02:16:13.300
And she was so small

02:16:13.300 --> 02:16:15.300
and so tiny.

02:16:15.300 --> 02:16:17.300
I generally didn't think that she was going to make it.

02:16:17.300 --> 02:16:19.300
But she did.

02:16:19.300 --> 02:16:21.300
She got around these antibiotics

02:16:21.300 --> 02:16:23.300
because one doctor was like, oh, maybe she

02:16:23.300 --> 02:16:25.300
has this. I don't fucking know.

02:16:25.300 --> 02:16:27.300
And so we just threw shit at the wall

02:16:27.300 --> 02:16:29.300
and hope that it sticks.

02:16:29.300 --> 02:16:31.300
And it did. So I am hoping

02:16:31.300 --> 02:16:33.300
that

02:16:33.300 --> 02:16:35.300
the antibiotics help her again.

02:16:35.300 --> 02:16:37.300
I don't know if she has some sort of viral thing

02:16:37.300 --> 02:16:39.300
that just like makes her shut down

02:16:39.300 --> 02:16:41.300
her ability to,

02:16:41.300 --> 02:16:43.300
I don't know any virus like that.

02:16:43.300 --> 02:16:45.300
The doctor said it could be toxoplasmosis

02:16:45.300 --> 02:16:47.300
which is why they have

02:16:47.300 --> 02:16:49.300
women who are pregnant

02:16:49.300 --> 02:16:51.300
not scoop litter boxes because

02:16:51.300 --> 02:16:53.300
humans can get it and like it's very

02:16:53.300 --> 02:16:55.300
dangerous.

02:16:55.300 --> 02:16:57.300
So I think

02:16:57.300 --> 02:16:59.300
they like they have no idea but they're like

02:16:59.300 --> 02:17:01.300
maybe she has that but they tested her

02:17:01.300 --> 02:17:03.300
for it and it didn't really come back for anything.

02:17:03.300 --> 02:17:05.300
But hey, it worked so

02:17:05.300 --> 02:17:07.300
we don't really care.

02:17:07.300 --> 02:17:09.300
So I already started her in the meds.

02:17:09.300 --> 02:17:11.300
The doctor and like

02:17:11.300 --> 02:17:13.300
I emailed her like in like 5am

02:17:13.300 --> 02:17:15.300
because I woke up because I just have

02:17:15.300 --> 02:17:17.300
like a fucking sixth sense about those

02:17:17.300 --> 02:17:19.300
things. And I noticed

02:17:19.300 --> 02:17:21.300
that Fia like was just

02:17:21.300 --> 02:17:23.300
stuck under the bed and that's where she is

02:17:23.300 --> 02:17:25.300
now but she's on the edge

02:17:25.300 --> 02:17:27.300
so I can pull her out if I can like bring her

02:17:27.300 --> 02:17:29.300
to the litter box or bring her to the

02:17:29.300 --> 02:17:31.300
thing.

02:17:31.300 --> 02:17:33.300
But yeah, I'm very

02:17:33.300 --> 02:17:35.300
and that's why I have that crate is

02:17:35.300 --> 02:17:37.300
because I would have to crater when I left

02:17:37.300 --> 02:17:39.300
when I had to go to work or anything

02:17:39.300 --> 02:17:41.300
but I essentially

02:17:41.300 --> 02:17:43.300
was literally just being her caretaker

02:17:43.300 --> 02:17:45.300
around the clock.

02:17:45.300 --> 02:17:47.300
How long does it take for the meds to kick in? I have no idea.

02:17:47.300 --> 02:17:49.300
No clue.

02:17:49.300 --> 02:17:51.300
But I'm hoping it's soon.

02:17:51.300 --> 02:17:53.300
All I know is that

02:17:53.300 --> 02:17:55.300
she can be fixed, that she can be

02:17:55.300 --> 02:17:57.300
okay, that it is something

02:17:57.300 --> 02:17:59.300
that must flare up every once in a while.

02:17:59.300 --> 02:18:01.300
I'm thinking it might have happened

02:18:01.300 --> 02:18:03.300
because she was stressed that I was gone

02:18:03.300 --> 02:18:05.300
is my guess.

02:18:05.300 --> 02:18:07.300
Or I don't know if

02:18:07.300 --> 02:18:09.300
like

02:18:09.300 --> 02:18:11.300
my mom's like maybe like boomie

02:18:11.300 --> 02:18:13.300
like passes something along

02:18:13.300 --> 02:18:15.300
to her and like all the other cats are immune

02:18:15.300 --> 02:18:17.300
but Fia and I'm like maybe she just

02:18:17.300 --> 02:18:19.300
like I'm pretty sure like Fia is just like immune

02:18:19.300 --> 02:18:21.300
no deficient.

02:18:21.300 --> 02:18:23.300
The foster mom

02:18:23.300 --> 02:18:25.300
because I rescued Fia from the south

02:18:25.300 --> 02:18:27.300
from like Mississippi so that's

02:18:27.300 --> 02:18:29.300
why I get that Mississippi joke a lot.

02:18:31.300 --> 02:18:33.300
I'm getting dizzy a little bit.

02:18:33.300 --> 02:18:35.300
She said her sister

02:18:35.300 --> 02:18:37.300
passed away from complications

02:18:37.300 --> 02:18:39.300
because she couldn't move and so I'm wondering

02:18:39.300 --> 02:18:41.300
if it's like a congenital thing

02:18:41.300 --> 02:18:43.300
or she was born with this condition.

02:18:43.300 --> 02:18:45.300
But yeah.

02:18:45.300 --> 02:18:47.300
But I gave

02:18:47.300 --> 02:18:49.300
her all the vet

02:18:49.300 --> 02:18:51.300
minus the vet pills because

02:18:51.300 --> 02:18:53.300
again you guys know how much I fucking

02:18:53.300 --> 02:18:55.300
know in vet pills. It's a lot.

02:18:59.300 --> 02:19:01.300
The vet like was literally

02:19:01.300 --> 02:19:03.300
what I like with the vet is she tried to

02:19:03.300 --> 02:19:05.300
cut corners for prices

02:19:05.300 --> 02:19:07.300
where she could. She like reduced a lot of pricing

02:19:07.300 --> 02:19:09.300
for me because she knew it was like really

02:19:09.300 --> 02:19:11.300
like again like thousands and thousands

02:19:11.300 --> 02:19:13.300
of dollars just to try to save my cat

02:19:15.300 --> 02:19:17.300
and

02:19:17.300 --> 02:19:19.300
yeah I'm wondering

02:19:19.300 --> 02:19:21.300
if like the stress of me being gone

02:19:21.300 --> 02:19:23.300
triggered it

02:19:23.300 --> 02:19:25.300
or something else or like

02:19:25.300 --> 02:19:27.300
my mom was cleaning the litter box while I was gone

02:19:27.300 --> 02:19:29.300
so like the litter boxes weren't dirty

02:19:29.300 --> 02:19:31.300
so there couldn't be like a bacterial infection.

02:19:31.300 --> 02:19:33.300
They literally don't know

02:19:33.300 --> 02:19:35.300
it's not they don't think it's by food

02:19:35.300 --> 02:19:37.300
she doesn't seem allergic to anything.

02:19:37.300 --> 02:19:39.300
So many tests so much stuff.

02:19:39.300 --> 02:19:41.300
I'm sorry to dump that all on you

02:19:41.300 --> 02:19:43.300
but I just want to give you context

02:19:43.300 --> 02:19:45.300
as to kind of what I'm dealing with

02:19:45.300 --> 02:19:47.300
and I have been dealing with since March

02:19:47.300 --> 02:19:49.300
I'm just I am just

02:19:49.300 --> 02:19:51.300
thankful that

02:19:51.300 --> 02:19:53.300
it can be sorted and that she can

02:19:53.300 --> 02:19:55.300
be fine and she can play and she can run

02:19:55.300 --> 02:19:57.300
and she can jump

02:19:59.300 --> 02:20:01.300
eventually and so I'm just gonna

02:20:01.300 --> 02:20:03.300
wait for that to happen

02:20:03.300 --> 02:20:05.300
I'm gonna hope that the antibiotics work

02:20:05.300 --> 02:20:07.300
and if not there are two other medications

02:20:07.300 --> 02:20:09.300
she was on that will probably all bring them all

02:20:09.300 --> 02:20:11.300
into rotation again

02:20:11.300 --> 02:20:13.300
I'm just gonna tackle it. I will fight for Fia

02:20:13.300 --> 02:20:15.300
she is my baby

02:20:15.300 --> 02:20:17.300
she is my she

02:20:17.300 --> 02:20:19.300
was with Reina when Reina was sick. I still have to bring Reina

02:20:19.300 --> 02:20:21.300
to the vet because they're like oh yeah Reina might have cancer

02:20:21.300 --> 02:20:23.300
and I'm like fucking

02:20:23.300 --> 02:20:25.300
great like come on

02:20:25.300 --> 02:20:27.300
stop and then I'm motion sick and I can't even

02:20:27.300 --> 02:20:29.300
bring my cat to the vet

02:20:29.300 --> 02:20:31.300
I still think

02:20:31.300 --> 02:20:33.300
when my mom drove me today to get her meds

02:20:33.300 --> 02:20:35.300
um

02:20:35.300 --> 02:20:37.300
yeah it's just really

02:20:37.300 --> 02:20:39.300
shitty because my cats are my life they're all I have

02:20:39.300 --> 02:20:41.300
besides you guys and my family

02:20:41.300 --> 02:20:43.300
it just sucks

02:20:43.300 --> 02:20:45.300
Reina I'm kind of

02:20:45.300 --> 02:20:47.300
may peace with because she's 14

02:20:47.300 --> 02:20:49.300
she already has a lot of health issues

02:20:49.300 --> 02:20:51.300
she's got kidney disease she's in my arms

02:20:51.300 --> 02:20:53.300
right now purring

02:20:53.300 --> 02:20:55.300
um

02:20:55.300 --> 02:20:57.300
why did you get sick all of a sudden and I think it was from traveling

02:20:57.300 --> 02:20:59.300
my mom was

02:20:59.300 --> 02:21:01.300
wondering if I got oh I have to tell you guys

02:21:01.300 --> 02:21:03.300
what happened I didn't tell you guys what happened

02:21:03.300 --> 02:21:05.300
to me I'm so sorry that I'm kind of just dumping

02:21:05.300 --> 02:21:07.300
this on you but

02:21:07.300 --> 02:21:09.300
uh I haven't seen my therapist yet

02:21:09.300 --> 02:21:11.300
so I'm just gonna tell you guys instead

02:21:11.300 --> 02:21:13.300
um

02:21:13.300 --> 02:21:15.300
yeah Reina's

02:21:15.300 --> 02:21:17.300
being a cutie on my lap I have to bring Reina

02:21:17.300 --> 02:21:19.300
to the vet to get her calcium check

02:21:19.300 --> 02:21:21.300
she either has a thyroid issue or she is cancer

02:21:21.300 --> 02:21:23.300
you better not have fucking cancer

02:21:23.300 --> 02:21:25.300
or I'll be pissed

02:21:25.300 --> 02:21:27.300
if she has cancer

02:21:27.300 --> 02:21:29.300
I don't think she would be able to survive treatment

02:21:29.300 --> 02:21:31.300
so I don't want to put her through that

02:21:31.300 --> 02:21:33.300
we'll see

02:21:33.300 --> 02:21:35.300
um she's she was playing and running around

02:21:35.300 --> 02:21:37.300
today so I honestly

02:21:37.300 --> 02:21:39.300
she was eating a lot

02:21:39.300 --> 02:21:41.300
so I'm wondering if um this is like a

02:21:41.300 --> 02:21:43.300
thyroid issue because that just makes

02:21:43.300 --> 02:21:45.300
way more sense to me because it's

02:21:45.300 --> 02:21:47.300
just makes more sense with what else

02:21:47.300 --> 02:21:49.300
she's going on um

02:21:49.300 --> 02:21:51.300
I know literally

02:21:51.300 --> 02:21:53.300
the house and everything goes wrong uh

02:21:53.300 --> 02:21:55.300
and

02:21:55.300 --> 02:21:57.300
my mom said she noticed it

02:21:57.300 --> 02:21:59.300
that Fia was acting weird

02:21:59.300 --> 02:22:01.300
when my mom first came to visit she was checking

02:22:01.300 --> 02:22:03.300
on her she says she was very

02:22:03.300 --> 02:22:05.300
my cats are very friendly

02:22:05.300 --> 02:22:07.300
she's like Fia was hiding under the bed she didn't want

02:22:07.300 --> 02:22:09.300
to come out and she usually she only does

02:22:09.300 --> 02:22:11.300
that if she feels like she's

02:22:11.300 --> 02:22:13.300
not feeling good or she feels threatened

02:22:13.300 --> 02:22:15.300
like a cat doesn't want to be bothered

02:22:15.300 --> 02:22:17.300
and all that stuff so I'm like hmm interesting

02:22:17.300 --> 02:22:19.300
um but as for me

02:22:19.300 --> 02:22:21.300
uh yeah I

02:22:23.300 --> 02:22:25.300
traveling was a nightmare I died I

02:22:25.300 --> 02:22:27.300
I'm gonna have to do it again soon um

02:22:27.300 --> 02:22:29.300
and I don't want to do

02:22:29.300 --> 02:22:31.300
it I have to travel again like October

02:22:31.300 --> 02:22:33.300
I still don't know the dates for another

02:22:33.300 --> 02:22:35.300
thing another family thing

02:22:35.300 --> 02:22:37.300
I think that'll also

02:22:37.300 --> 02:22:39.300
be it won't be in Florida again but

02:22:39.300 --> 02:22:41.300
I just got really dizzy

02:22:41.300 --> 02:22:43.300
because I'm moving my head around

02:22:43.300 --> 02:22:45.300
looking for the cats um

02:22:45.300 --> 02:22:47.300
so yeah

02:22:47.300 --> 02:22:49.300
I'll give you the rundown

02:22:57.300 --> 02:22:59.300
so what was supposed to

02:22:59.300 --> 02:23:01.300
so I I didn't tell you guys

02:23:01.300 --> 02:23:03.300
because I also didn't say a lot what was going on

02:23:03.300 --> 02:23:05.300
with me or talk about

02:23:05.300 --> 02:23:07.300
what was going on with me because I didn't want you guys to worry

02:23:07.300 --> 02:23:09.300
and I didn't just want to go on my twitter and

02:23:09.300 --> 02:23:11.300
just like be like my life sucks

02:23:11.300 --> 02:23:13.300
this happened that happened this

02:23:13.300 --> 02:23:15.300
happened um but I did have a layover

02:23:15.300 --> 02:23:17.300
um

02:23:17.300 --> 02:23:19.300
an ATL if you guys just like be in

02:23:19.300 --> 02:23:21.300
an airport um

02:23:23.300 --> 02:23:25.300
and to get to

02:23:25.300 --> 02:23:27.300
the place where I was going

02:23:27.300 --> 02:23:29.300
and what should have been

02:23:29.300 --> 02:23:31.300
like a quick flight

02:23:31.300 --> 02:23:33.300
afterwards

02:23:33.300 --> 02:23:35.300
turned out to be

02:23:35.300 --> 02:23:37.300
like four hours of waiting

02:23:37.300 --> 02:23:39.300
on a taxiway because I think

02:23:39.300 --> 02:23:41.300
around that time is when the stuff went down

02:23:41.300 --> 02:23:43.300
but we didn't know that

02:23:43.300 --> 02:23:45.300
um yeah I hate that fucking airport

02:23:45.300 --> 02:23:47.300
I'll tell you that right now

02:23:47.300 --> 02:23:49.300
um I hate airports

02:23:49.300 --> 02:23:51.300
I hate crowds of people I like

02:23:51.300 --> 02:23:53.300
I get sick very easily

02:23:53.300 --> 02:23:55.300
and I'm surprised I didn't get sick

02:23:55.300 --> 02:23:57.300
I immediately took a shower

02:23:57.300 --> 02:23:59.300
when I got to my family's house

02:23:59.300 --> 02:24:01.300
and I was like I need to get this gross off me

02:24:01.300 --> 02:24:03.300
so I already had

02:24:03.300 --> 02:24:05.300
a few hours and then I had to wait

02:24:05.300 --> 02:24:07.300
another few hours

02:24:07.300 --> 02:24:09.300
and I just hate I didn't have a direct flight

02:24:09.300 --> 02:24:11.300
so I'm just like I hate it here

02:24:11.300 --> 02:24:13.300
um

02:24:13.300 --> 02:24:15.300
and then I didn't get to my

02:24:15.300 --> 02:24:17.300
grandparents house until like

02:24:17.300 --> 02:24:19.300
3am because they couldn't come pick me up

02:24:19.300 --> 02:24:21.300
because they're older and they don't have the luxury

02:24:21.300 --> 02:24:23.300
of driving at night like I didn't want to put them

02:24:23.300 --> 02:24:25.300
in that situation so I took me a while to

02:24:25.300 --> 02:24:27.300
excuse me find me a

02:24:27.300 --> 02:24:29.300
ride I couldn't get a rental car

02:24:29.300 --> 02:24:31.300
there's no rental cars available

02:24:31.300 --> 02:24:33.300
um

02:24:33.300 --> 02:24:35.300
and

02:24:35.300 --> 02:24:37.300
I managed to get an Uber and I

02:24:37.300 --> 02:24:39.300
dropped a good chunk of change on an Uber

02:24:39.300 --> 02:24:41.300
so that was fun

02:24:41.300 --> 02:24:43.300
then I finally got there and I was half dead

02:24:43.300 --> 02:24:45.300
and then

02:24:45.300 --> 02:24:47.300
the weather was shit the majority of the time

02:24:49.300 --> 02:24:51.300
so I couldn't really do a lot

02:24:51.300 --> 02:24:53.300
there was like one sunny day

02:24:53.300 --> 02:24:55.300
and it was just gross and humid and I hated it

02:24:57.300 --> 02:24:59.300
I think honestly the only funny thing

02:24:59.300 --> 02:25:01.300
was when that frog somehow got in the house

02:25:01.300 --> 02:25:03.300
into the toilet

02:25:03.300 --> 02:25:05.300
it was fun catching it

02:25:05.300 --> 02:25:07.300
because my whole family was like

02:25:07.300 --> 02:25:09.300
and I'm the only one that likes

02:25:09.300 --> 02:25:11.300
bugs and like amphibians

02:25:11.300 --> 02:25:13.300
and reptiles and invertebrates

02:25:13.300 --> 02:25:15.300
so I just like yanked it and I'm like

02:25:15.300 --> 02:25:17.300
you're mine you're gonna be my friend

02:25:17.300 --> 02:25:19.300
I was gonna kiss it

02:25:19.300 --> 02:25:21.300
and then my but my grandmother was

02:25:21.300 --> 02:25:23.300
freaking out so I didn't do that

02:25:23.300 --> 02:25:25.300
but our frog and a snake

02:25:25.300 --> 02:25:27.300
I've grabbed snakes before

02:25:27.300 --> 02:25:29.300
um when I would go with my

02:25:29.300 --> 02:25:31.300
I've mentioned my grandfather before when I would go

02:25:31.300 --> 02:25:33.300
in the woods my grandfather I snatched a snake up

02:25:33.300 --> 02:25:35.300
and like I know I know my snakes

02:25:35.300 --> 02:25:37.300
so I know one one's poisonous

02:25:37.300 --> 02:25:39.300
and one's not

02:25:39.300 --> 02:25:41.300
it was like a little rat snake that I

02:25:41.300 --> 02:25:43.300
snatched and I was like

02:25:47.300 --> 02:25:49.300
frog was cannon

02:25:49.300 --> 02:25:51.300
and so yeah I put the frog outside

02:25:51.300 --> 02:25:53.300
somebody was like flush it I'm like

02:25:53.300 --> 02:25:55.300
what that's just messed up

02:25:55.300 --> 02:25:57.300
and I'm not gonna flush a frog down the toilet

02:25:57.300 --> 02:25:59.300
although I know that's where you crawled up from

02:25:59.300 --> 02:26:01.300
but it was it was really weird

02:26:01.300 --> 02:26:03.300
I felt something wet on my butt cheek

02:26:03.300 --> 02:26:05.300
um it was because

02:26:05.300 --> 02:26:07.300
the frog was behind the seat

02:26:07.300 --> 02:26:09.300
and it was like trying to get away from my fat ass

02:26:09.300 --> 02:26:11.300
I was just gonna sit on it

02:26:11.300 --> 02:26:13.300
um

02:26:13.300 --> 02:26:15.300
so I left it outside

02:26:15.300 --> 02:26:17.300
that was me my pet

02:26:19.300 --> 02:26:21.300
I was about to drop some heat too I was like

02:26:21.300 --> 02:26:23.300
I was about to blow that shit up

02:26:23.300 --> 02:26:25.300
that's probably what it died

02:26:27.300 --> 02:26:29.300
cause I get really sick after it cause I get

02:26:29.300 --> 02:26:31.300
motion sick and the motion sick makes me nauseous

02:26:31.300 --> 02:26:33.300
and the nauseous gives me tummy upset

02:26:33.300 --> 02:26:35.300
and that was just a bad thing

02:26:35.300 --> 02:26:37.300
um and then so I finally

02:26:37.300 --> 02:26:39.300
like we're hanging out whatever

02:26:39.300 --> 02:26:41.300
is fine but I was so

02:26:41.300 --> 02:26:43.300
tired and I felt so

02:26:43.300 --> 02:26:45.300
crappy the entire time

02:26:45.300 --> 02:26:47.300
that we couldn't really do anything so I literally

02:26:47.300 --> 02:26:49.300
just like watched Elden Ring videos

02:26:49.300 --> 02:26:51.300
and I forgot my switch

02:26:51.300 --> 02:26:53.300
and I was pissed cause

02:26:53.300 --> 02:26:55.300
like my family likes to play like Mario Party

02:26:55.300 --> 02:26:57.300
when we're all together like that was our thing

02:26:57.300 --> 02:26:59.300
like they always come over our house

02:26:59.300 --> 02:27:01.300
my family's house and we all play Mario Party

02:27:01.300 --> 02:27:03.300
um a frog was spared

02:27:03.300 --> 02:27:05.300
um

02:27:05.300 --> 02:27:07.300
nobody got there a snake

02:27:07.300 --> 02:27:09.300
no a knife

02:27:09.300 --> 02:27:11.300
no um

02:27:11.300 --> 02:27:13.300
I

02:27:13.300 --> 02:27:15.300
like Elden Ring

02:27:15.300 --> 02:27:17.300
I'm so happy it's my hyper fixation again

02:27:17.300 --> 02:27:19.300
cause I need that I need a distraction

02:27:19.300 --> 02:27:21.300
and Elden Ring is my distraction

02:27:21.300 --> 02:27:23.300
um

02:27:25.300 --> 02:27:27.300
cause I also didn't want to hear talk about church

02:27:27.300 --> 02:27:29.300
and stuff for my family

02:27:29.300 --> 02:27:31.300
um and then

02:27:31.300 --> 02:27:33.300
going back was also a nightmare

02:27:33.300 --> 02:27:35.300
uh go ahead and do an overlay

02:27:35.300 --> 02:27:37.300
an overlay

02:27:37.300 --> 02:27:39.300
a layover in ATL again

02:27:39.300 --> 02:27:41.300
and there's so many people trapped in that airport

02:27:41.300 --> 02:27:43.300
um because the flights

02:27:43.300 --> 02:27:45.300
were all messed up

02:27:45.300 --> 02:27:47.300
for like a lot of the airlines

02:27:47.300 --> 02:27:49.300
and it sucked

02:27:49.300 --> 02:27:51.300
I heard so many stories

02:27:51.300 --> 02:27:53.300
people in the south

02:27:53.300 --> 02:27:55.300
they're just so nice those telling you anything

02:27:55.300 --> 02:27:57.300
to a woman she's telling me her whole life story

02:27:57.300 --> 02:27:59.300
and I'm just like

02:27:59.300 --> 02:28:01.300
I'm from the north I'm like who the fuck do you think you talk

02:28:01.300 --> 02:28:03.300
don't talk to me then I'm like but then you know

02:28:03.300 --> 02:28:05.300
I put on my sweet smile

02:28:05.300 --> 02:28:07.300
and I'm like hey okay

02:28:07.300 --> 02:28:09.300
um

02:28:09.300 --> 02:28:11.300
new theory about

02:28:11.300 --> 02:28:13.300
America being a jar person

02:28:13.300 --> 02:28:15.300
instead of being a normal being

02:28:15.300 --> 02:28:17.300
nice

02:28:17.300 --> 02:28:19.300
amazing theory I think you should

02:28:19.300 --> 02:28:21.300
she definitely do a deep dive

02:28:21.300 --> 02:28:23.300
did your family question you about your job they did

02:28:23.300 --> 02:28:25.300
it was very awkward

02:28:25.300 --> 02:28:27.300
I just kept saying I was under NDA

02:28:27.300 --> 02:28:29.300
and then I was just like

02:28:29.300 --> 02:28:31.300
I'm just a voice actor

02:28:31.300 --> 02:28:33.300
actress whatever um and I worked for

02:28:33.300 --> 02:28:35.300
a social media startup so I was just like throwing out everything

02:28:35.300 --> 02:28:37.300
I should have said I worked for the government

02:28:37.300 --> 02:28:39.300
but I don't think my grandparents would believe me

02:28:39.300 --> 02:28:41.300
um yeah we don't do that up there

02:28:41.300 --> 02:28:43.300
we don't do that up in the north

02:28:43.300 --> 02:28:45.300
mm-mm

02:28:45.300 --> 02:28:47.300
we're hard and cold in the north

02:28:47.300 --> 02:28:49.300
um

02:28:49.300 --> 02:28:51.300
all the ones words literally

02:28:51.300 --> 02:28:53.300
and uh

02:28:55.300 --> 02:28:57.300
and then so stuck there

02:28:57.300 --> 02:28:59.300
my I was up till

02:28:59.300 --> 02:29:01.300
since 3 a.m. because you guys

02:29:01.300 --> 02:29:03.300
like in my space I was like

02:29:03.300 --> 02:29:05.300
I'm doing my makeup now I'm getting ready

02:29:05.300 --> 02:29:07.300
now because I'm not going to be able to do this

02:29:07.300 --> 02:29:09.300
when I first wake up I'm happy I did that

02:29:09.300 --> 02:29:11.300
um I woke up at 3

02:29:11.300 --> 02:29:13.300
I got made sure everything was good

02:29:13.300 --> 02:29:15.300
I called an Uber for about

02:29:15.300 --> 02:29:17.300
because they couldn't drive me

02:29:17.300 --> 02:29:19.300
like an hour and a half

02:29:19.300 --> 02:29:21.300
and then finally around

02:29:21.300 --> 02:29:23.300
like 4.30

02:29:23.300 --> 02:29:25.300
I was able to snag one

02:29:25.300 --> 02:29:27.300
and this dude

02:29:27.300 --> 02:29:29.300
decides to just talk to me the entire time

02:29:29.300 --> 02:29:31.300
and I'm like dude it's 4 a.m.

02:29:31.300 --> 02:29:33.300
why are you fucking talking to me

02:29:33.300 --> 02:29:35.300
just drive me to the damn airport

02:29:35.300 --> 02:29:37.300
um

02:29:37.300 --> 02:29:39.300
I just got shadow limbs

02:29:39.300 --> 02:29:41.300
and the broken bits

02:29:41.300 --> 02:29:43.300
shadows like a jar or houses ill

02:29:45.300 --> 02:29:47.300
are you being legit with your theory

02:29:47.300 --> 02:29:49.300
because I'm going to laugh at you

02:29:49.300 --> 02:29:51.300
anyways

02:29:51.300 --> 02:29:53.300
uh but like

02:29:53.300 --> 02:29:55.300
I'm like I can be nice so I was like

02:29:55.300 --> 02:29:57.300
I'll humor people

02:29:57.300 --> 02:29:59.300
um

02:29:59.300 --> 02:30:01.300
my first my first Uber driver

02:30:01.300 --> 02:30:03.300
that like drove me to my grandparents house

02:30:03.300 --> 02:30:05.300
was like very south he's like yeah I fought in the war

02:30:05.300 --> 02:30:07.300
you know that plane you just came off on

02:30:07.300 --> 02:30:09.300
you know

02:30:09.300 --> 02:30:11.300
I've been one of those and I almost fell out

02:30:11.300 --> 02:30:13.300
of one of those and my sergeant I was like

02:30:13.300 --> 02:30:15.300
bro are you telling me a story about how you almost

02:30:15.300 --> 02:30:17.300
died in one of the planes I was in

02:30:17.300 --> 02:30:19.300
why are you doing this to me

02:30:19.300 --> 02:30:21.300
like I hate this

02:30:21.300 --> 02:30:23.300
um

02:30:23.300 --> 02:30:25.300
and so then I get to the airport

02:30:25.300 --> 02:30:27.300
I like

02:30:27.300 --> 02:30:29.300
what is it

02:30:29.300 --> 02:30:31.300
my flight leaves at

02:30:31.300 --> 02:30:33.300
6.50

02:30:33.300 --> 02:30:35.300
should always get to the airport like 2 to 3 hours early

02:30:35.300 --> 02:30:37.300
um

02:30:37.300 --> 02:30:39.300
did that

02:30:39.300 --> 02:30:41.300
flew

02:30:41.300 --> 02:30:43.300
like

02:30:43.300 --> 02:30:45.300
an hour late

02:30:45.300 --> 02:30:47.300
it was delayed an hour

02:30:47.300 --> 02:30:49.300
jealousy stop

02:30:49.300 --> 02:30:51.300
um

02:30:51.300 --> 02:30:53.300
why do you spell her name wrong

02:30:53.300 --> 02:30:55.300
every time you type it

02:30:55.300 --> 02:30:57.300
Merica Merica Merica

02:30:57.300 --> 02:30:59.300
Merica

02:30:59.300 --> 02:31:01.300
oh my god

02:31:01.300 --> 02:31:03.300
um and then I get

02:31:03.300 --> 02:31:05.300
to ATL

02:31:05.300 --> 02:31:07.300
and I think we got delayed like 3 hours

02:31:07.300 --> 02:31:09.300
um

02:31:09.300 --> 02:31:11.300
and then the flight took to I was so over it

02:31:11.300 --> 02:31:13.300
I was so fucking over it

02:31:13.300 --> 02:31:15.300
and it's not I'm not done yet

02:31:15.300 --> 02:31:17.300
I'm not done yet I finally land

02:31:17.300 --> 02:31:19.300
where I'm supposed to be

02:31:19.300 --> 02:31:21.300
America

02:31:21.300 --> 02:31:23.300
Merica

02:31:23.300 --> 02:31:25.300
um

02:31:25.300 --> 02:31:27.300
and my mom's unable to pick me up

02:31:27.300 --> 02:31:29.300
from the airport so I'm like okay I'll take

02:31:29.300 --> 02:31:31.300
public transportation

02:31:31.300 --> 02:31:33.300
and so I'm

02:31:33.300 --> 02:31:35.300
going different places

02:31:35.300 --> 02:31:37.300
going to different taking a bus

02:31:37.300 --> 02:31:39.300
doing the train doing this bus

02:31:39.300 --> 02:31:41.300
doing this taxi and I'm trying to get

02:31:41.300 --> 02:31:43.300
closer so my mom can pick me up

02:31:43.300 --> 02:31:45.300
to a closer town

02:31:45.300 --> 02:31:47.300
um

02:31:47.300 --> 02:31:49.300
and then my dad's like

02:31:49.300 --> 02:31:51.300
oh

02:31:51.300 --> 02:31:53.300
you're near me

02:31:53.300 --> 02:31:55.300
why didn't you just say so

02:31:55.300 --> 02:31:57.300
come back this way the place that you finally

02:31:57.300 --> 02:31:59.300
oh because I got to the

02:31:59.300 --> 02:32:01.300
I got to a train station

02:32:01.300 --> 02:32:03.300
and the trains like oh you're you just missed a train

02:32:03.300 --> 02:32:05.300
it's about an hour and I'm literally like I'm going

02:32:05.300 --> 02:32:07.300
to throw myself in the tracks right now

02:32:07.300 --> 02:32:09.300
it was

02:32:09.300 --> 02:32:11.300
I got up at 3am it was

02:32:11.300 --> 02:32:13.300
the train won't come till 3.45 I'm like I'm ending

02:32:13.300 --> 02:32:15.300
my life in Minecraft

02:32:15.300 --> 02:32:17.300
right on these tracks and you can do nothing about it

02:32:17.300 --> 02:32:19.300
conductor

02:32:19.300 --> 02:32:21.300
um

02:32:21.300 --> 02:32:23.300
and so

02:32:23.300 --> 02:32:25.300
my dad's like oh why didn't you just say

02:32:25.300 --> 02:32:27.300
that you were nearby

02:32:27.300 --> 02:32:29.300
because then you can just come over here

02:32:29.300 --> 02:32:31.300
and pretty much retrace

02:32:31.300 --> 02:32:33.300
the last two hours that you took

02:32:33.300 --> 02:32:35.300
and come back to my work

02:32:35.300 --> 02:32:37.300
and I'll drive you home and I'm like

02:32:37.300 --> 02:32:39.300
dad are you

02:32:39.300 --> 02:32:41.300
I told you the plan with mom

02:32:41.300 --> 02:32:43.300
I was going to take

02:32:43.300 --> 02:32:45.300
this train

02:32:45.300 --> 02:32:47.300
to go to this town

02:32:47.300 --> 02:32:49.300
mom would pick me up at this station

02:32:49.300 --> 02:32:51.300
and I told you that like

02:32:51.300 --> 02:32:53.300
literally like

02:32:53.300 --> 02:32:55.300
when I got off the plane and you're saying oh wait

02:32:55.300 --> 02:32:57.300
that's right

02:32:57.300 --> 02:32:59.300
I forget you're near me

02:32:59.300 --> 02:33:01.300
I'll drive you home and I'm like

02:33:01.300 --> 02:33:03.300

02:33:09.300 --> 02:33:11.300
I went all the way back took a train

02:33:11.300 --> 02:33:13.300

02:33:13.300 --> 02:33:15.300
where I came from

02:33:15.300 --> 02:33:17.300
and then

02:33:17.300 --> 02:33:19.300
I take a train

02:33:19.300 --> 02:33:21.300
to near where my dad works

02:33:21.300 --> 02:33:23.300
and

02:33:23.300 --> 02:33:25.300
I have to

02:33:25.300 --> 02:33:27.300
walk

02:33:27.300 --> 02:33:29.300
with my suitcase and it's like super fucking

02:33:29.300 --> 02:33:31.300
hot out and I have to walk

02:33:31.300 --> 02:33:33.300
to go down this plethora of stairs

02:33:33.300 --> 02:33:35.300
and I have to walk

02:33:35.300 --> 02:33:37.300
and walk and walk

02:33:37.300 --> 02:33:39.300

02:33:47.300 --> 02:33:49.300
fuck I went the wrong way

02:33:49.300 --> 02:33:51.300
so I had to walk back

02:33:51.300 --> 02:33:53.300
walk to retrace all my decks and walk

02:33:53.300 --> 02:33:55.300
back and go down the other opposite

02:33:55.300 --> 02:33:57.300
way

02:33:57.300 --> 02:33:59.300
and then I got to go down the stairs

02:33:59.300 --> 02:34:01.300
I got to go down this path

02:34:01.300 --> 02:34:03.300

fun I usually like and it was the worst

02:34:53.300 --> 02:34:55.300
travel experience of my fucking life

02:34:55.300 --> 02:34:57.300

02:35:33.300 --> 02:35:35.300

02:35:39.300 --> 02:35:41.300
time

02:35:41.300 --> 02:35:43.300

02:35:47.300 --> 02:35:49.300
in the elevator in my apartment I go

02:35:49.300 --> 02:35:51.300
up to my floor I step

02:35:51.300 --> 02:35:53.300
off and sometimes every time I usually

02:35:53.300 --> 02:35:55.300
step off an elevator I'll get a little vertigo

02:35:55.300 --> 02:35:57.300
hello

02:36:09.300 --> 02:36:11.300

02:36:11.300 --> 02:36:13.300
you're a grown ass man I can't tell you what to spend

02:36:15.300 --> 02:36:17.300
yeah all the stress is caught that's what my mom said she's like

02:36:17.300 --> 02:36:19.300
you were stressed out when you realize

02:36:19.300 --> 02:36:21.300
you were home your body just crumbled

02:36:21.300 --> 02:36:23.300
I step out

02:36:23.300 --> 02:36:25.300
and I'm like I'm feeling a little bit wavy like I just

02:36:25.300 --> 02:36:27.300
stepped off of a boat I'm like whatever it'll

02:36:27.300 --> 02:36:29.300
go away because it's happened to me before

02:36:29.300 --> 02:36:31.300
I usually

02:36:31.300 --> 02:36:33.300
always get motion sick on escalators

02:36:33.300 --> 02:36:35.300
elevators like moving

02:36:35.300 --> 02:36:37.300
pathways

02:36:37.300 --> 02:36:39.300
the littlest thing

02:36:39.300 --> 02:36:41.300
social security

02:36:41.300 --> 02:36:43.300
social security what the fuck is that supposed to mean

02:36:45.300 --> 02:36:47.300

02:36:47.300 --> 02:36:49.300

and uh

02:36:55.300 --> 02:36:57.300
so

02:36:57.300 --> 02:36:59.300
and then I take a shower and I'm realizing I'm dizzy

02:36:59.300 --> 02:37:01.300
and I'm like whatever I'm gonna sleep it off

02:37:01.300 --> 02:37:03.300
I probably just have a headache from the heat

02:37:03.300 --> 02:37:05.300
I didn't drink enough water that's a fact

02:37:05.300 --> 02:37:07.300
um

02:37:07.300 --> 02:37:09.300
and

02:37:09.300 --> 02:37:11.300
I wake up and I have the

02:37:11.300 --> 02:37:13.300
worst fucking motion sickness

02:37:13.300 --> 02:37:15.300
and I'm not done yet

02:37:15.300 --> 02:37:17.300
I'm not done my story

02:37:21.300 --> 02:37:23.300
so as you guys know I was been motion sick

02:37:23.300 --> 02:37:25.300
I'm still motion sick

02:37:25.300 --> 02:37:27.300
um

02:37:27.300 --> 02:37:29.300
uh yeah the last time I also had vertigo

02:37:29.300 --> 02:37:31.300
this bad it was

02:37:31.300 --> 02:37:33.300
I had

02:37:33.300 --> 02:37:35.300
covid and then literally

02:37:35.300 --> 02:37:37.300
the day before I didn't know I had covid I went to an

02:37:37.300 --> 02:37:39.300
amusement park when I had covid whoops

02:37:41.300 --> 02:37:43.300
and

02:37:43.300 --> 02:37:45.300
unlike one of those like spinny

02:37:45.300 --> 02:37:47.300
I don't know what the fuck it's called it was six flags

02:37:47.300 --> 02:37:49.300
I don't know

02:37:49.300 --> 02:37:51.300
which six flags right it was

02:37:51.300 --> 02:37:53.300
but it just spun you around a lot

02:37:53.300 --> 02:37:55.300
and I was so

02:37:55.300 --> 02:37:57.300
I should have never done that

02:37:57.300 --> 02:37:59.300
it wasn't teacups

02:37:59.300 --> 02:38:01.300
but it was something yeah it was like a world

02:38:01.300 --> 02:38:03.300
gig looking thing that's a good way to say it

02:38:03.300 --> 02:38:05.300
um

02:38:05.300 --> 02:38:07.300
and

02:38:07.300 --> 02:38:09.300
I hadn't felt like that a while

02:38:09.300 --> 02:38:11.300
and so

02:38:11.300 --> 02:38:13.300
I just literally had had all the

02:38:13.300 --> 02:38:15.300
I don't have curtains

02:38:15.300 --> 02:38:17.300
but I have all the blinds closed

02:38:17.300 --> 02:38:19.300
I've had the lights off

02:38:19.300 --> 02:38:21.300
I'm just listening to Elden Ring Lore

02:38:21.300 --> 02:38:23.300
I'd sometimes try to read

02:38:23.300 --> 02:38:25.300
the book that I bought at the airport

02:38:25.300 --> 02:38:27.300
uh Raina and Fia were with me

02:38:27.300 --> 02:38:29.300
Boomi snuggled with me for a little bit

02:38:29.300 --> 02:38:31.300
which I was surprised because he

02:38:31.300 --> 02:38:33.300
he loves attention but he doesn't smuggle with you

02:38:33.300 --> 02:38:35.300
um but he the cats were

02:38:35.300 --> 02:38:37.300
so happy to see me Boomi was screaming

02:38:37.300 --> 02:38:39.300
when I got home he Boomi doesn't meow

02:38:39.300 --> 02:38:41.300
you guys hear him he goes

02:38:41.300 --> 02:38:43.300

02:39:45.300 --> 02:39:47.300
uh

02:39:47.300 --> 02:39:49.300
I'm a very lonely

02:39:49.300 --> 02:39:51.300
sad woman

02:39:51.300 --> 02:39:53.300
that's why I'm very parasocial

02:39:53.300 --> 02:39:55.300
and um

02:39:57.300 --> 02:39:59.300
so I'm motion sick the first

02:39:59.300 --> 02:40:01.300
day it's terrible

02:40:01.300 --> 02:40:03.300
I try to make myself some food

02:40:03.300 --> 02:40:05.300
I try to move I try

02:40:05.300 --> 02:40:07.300
it's bad I almost fell over

02:40:07.300 --> 02:40:09.300
I did fall at one point but I was already

02:40:09.300 --> 02:40:11.300
I just rolled off the couch it wasn't a big deal

02:40:11.300 --> 02:40:13.300
and I'm like oh my god

02:40:13.300 --> 02:40:15.300
and so I took like

02:40:15.300 --> 02:40:17.300
um some medication for it

02:40:17.300 --> 02:40:19.300
I have like the non drowsy

02:40:19.300 --> 02:40:21.300
um Dramamine

02:40:21.300 --> 02:40:23.300
or whatever it is it's like male cuisine

02:40:23.300 --> 02:40:25.300
took that didn't do shit

02:40:25.300 --> 02:40:27.300
took my other meds

02:40:27.300 --> 02:40:29.300
I'm like fuck

02:40:29.300 --> 02:40:31.300
that didn't really help I don't know why I thought it would

02:40:31.300 --> 02:40:33.300
um

02:40:33.300 --> 02:40:35.300
and then

02:40:35.300 --> 02:40:37.300
it's the next day

02:40:37.300 --> 02:40:39.300
in the middle of the day

02:40:39.300 --> 02:40:41.300
I get the worst pains

02:40:41.300 --> 02:40:43.300
of my life

02:40:43.300 --> 02:40:45.300
uh

02:40:45.300 --> 02:40:47.300
and I don't even know what triggered it

02:40:47.300 --> 02:40:49.300
I don't know if I got food poisoning

02:40:49.300 --> 02:40:51.300
I don't know if I have a had a virus

02:40:51.300 --> 02:40:53.300
or have a virus currently that I'm just like

02:40:53.300 --> 02:40:55.300
working out of my system

02:40:55.300 --> 02:40:57.300
I thought fun story time

02:40:57.300 --> 02:40:59.300
was enemies were prayer friends

02:40:59.300 --> 02:41:01.300
I was one random tough man so it was really

02:41:01.300 --> 02:41:03.300
um

02:41:03.300 --> 02:41:05.300
I

02:41:05.300 --> 02:41:07.300
felt like I was

02:41:07.300 --> 02:41:09.300
being

02:41:09.300 --> 02:41:11.300
stabbed

02:41:11.300 --> 02:41:13.300
in the gut

02:41:13.300 --> 02:41:15.300
and the pain was so

02:41:15.300 --> 02:41:17.300
unbearable I was trying not to

02:41:17.300 --> 02:41:19.300
cry I have a very high pain

02:41:19.300 --> 02:41:21.300
tolerance but it was bad

02:41:21.300 --> 02:41:23.300
um

02:41:23.300 --> 02:41:25.300
it was probably some of the worst excruciating

02:41:25.300 --> 02:41:27.300
pain I've ever felt

02:41:27.300 --> 02:41:29.300
and

02:41:29.300 --> 02:41:31.300
it was it was just horrible

02:41:31.300 --> 02:41:33.300
I would never want to go through that again

02:41:33.300 --> 02:41:35.300
um it was horrible

02:41:35.300 --> 02:41:37.300
because it was affecting because like how

02:41:37.300 --> 02:41:39.300
uh

02:41:39.300 --> 02:41:41.300
I think it never bothered me the first time like

02:41:41.300 --> 02:41:43.300
because I've had pain like that

02:41:43.300 --> 02:41:45.300
but I didn't have fibro when I had pain like that

02:41:45.300 --> 02:41:47.300
so it's different now because it hurts all the

02:41:47.300 --> 02:41:49.300
nerves in my body so my like

02:41:49.300 --> 02:41:51.300
that from I started from my stomach

02:41:51.300 --> 02:41:53.300
it shot down my legs I don't know if you guys

02:41:53.300 --> 02:41:55.300
have ever had sciatica

02:41:55.300 --> 02:41:57.300
or sciatic pain

02:41:57.300 --> 02:41:59.300
I had both my legs uh it also shot

02:41:59.300 --> 02:42:01.300
through my chest and into my shoulder and

02:42:01.300 --> 02:42:03.300
down my right arm

02:42:03.300 --> 02:42:05.300
and that's my arm that's bad and my

02:42:05.300 --> 02:42:07.300
shoulders messed up um

02:42:07.300 --> 02:42:09.300
I was really just curled up on a ball

02:42:09.300 --> 02:42:11.300
I really ripped up all my clothes

02:42:11.300 --> 02:42:13.300
I was just naked laying

02:42:13.300 --> 02:42:15.300
on the cold floor and just rocking myself

02:42:15.300 --> 02:42:17.300
and I thought I was gonna die

02:42:17.300 --> 02:42:19.300
and I didn't know what was gonna happen

02:42:19.300 --> 02:42:21.300
and

02:42:21.300 --> 02:42:23.300
it sounds like a I thought I

02:42:23.300 --> 02:42:25.300
literally thought it was like as I

02:42:25.300 --> 02:42:27.300
didn't know if I was having a heart attack I didn't know

02:42:27.300 --> 02:42:29.300
if my I thought my appendix was

02:42:29.300 --> 02:42:31.300
exploding

02:42:31.300 --> 02:42:33.300
um I was so scared

02:42:33.300 --> 02:42:35.300
because I'm like

02:42:35.300 --> 02:42:37.300
family's just gonna come in

02:42:37.300 --> 02:42:39.300
because my mom has a key to my place

02:42:39.300 --> 02:42:41.300
and she's just gonna find me dead naked

02:42:41.300 --> 02:42:43.300
in my bathroom and just like

02:42:43.300 --> 02:42:45.300
not know what the fuck happened to me

02:42:45.300 --> 02:42:47.300
and I'm literally sitting there

02:42:47.300 --> 02:42:49.300
and I feel my body just

02:42:49.300 --> 02:42:51.300
going cold and I'm like

02:42:51.300 --> 02:42:53.300
oh this is it this is how I die

02:42:53.300 --> 02:42:55.300
I wasn't so pain

02:42:55.300 --> 02:42:57.300
and I was just like my phone was across the room

02:42:57.300 --> 02:42:59.300
I couldn't call 911

02:42:59.300 --> 02:43:01.300
um I couldn't call my parents

02:43:01.300 --> 02:43:03.300
my watch was far away from me

02:43:03.300 --> 02:43:05.300
because I had taken it off to shower

02:43:05.300 --> 02:43:07.300
uh not yeah

02:43:07.300 --> 02:43:09.300
and I just never put it back on the charger

02:43:09.300 --> 02:43:11.300
or pack anywhere and so I was really just like

02:43:11.300 --> 02:43:13.300
and then I managed to pull myself onto the toilet

02:43:13.300 --> 02:43:15.300
um

02:43:15.300 --> 02:43:17.300
and uh

02:43:17.300 --> 02:43:19.300
I have a tummy upset

02:43:19.300 --> 02:43:21.300
and then at the same time

02:43:21.300 --> 02:43:23.300
from both ends

02:43:23.300 --> 02:43:25.300
uh

02:43:25.300 --> 02:43:27.300
I started just puking

02:43:27.300 --> 02:43:29.300
in my sink just

02:43:29.300 --> 02:43:31.300
fucking projectile vomiting

02:43:31.300 --> 02:43:33.300
sweating

02:43:33.300 --> 02:43:35.300
cold thinking I'm dying

02:43:35.300 --> 02:43:37.300
I'm like great my body

02:43:37.300 --> 02:43:39.300
shutting down I'm expelling all the

02:43:39.300 --> 02:43:41.300
waste

02:43:41.300 --> 02:43:43.300
um

02:43:43.300 --> 02:43:45.300
it was bad

02:43:45.300 --> 02:43:47.300
it was so bad but then I felt

02:43:47.300 --> 02:43:49.300
better after I puked and I was just like

02:43:49.300 --> 02:43:51.300
fuck do I have food poisoning and I'm like

02:43:51.300 --> 02:43:53.300
I didn't even eat anything bad

02:43:53.300 --> 02:43:55.300
that's what yeah when you when you guys saw that tweet

02:43:55.300 --> 02:43:57.300
saying I threw up

02:43:57.300 --> 02:43:59.300
that was literally what had just happened

02:44:01.300 --> 02:44:03.300
uh I did feel better

02:44:03.300 --> 02:44:05.300
and I decided like you know

02:44:05.300 --> 02:44:07.300
it was I had to put like

02:44:07.300 --> 02:44:09.300
it was bad

02:44:09.300 --> 02:44:11.300
like it was bad in my sink and so I like

02:44:11.300 --> 02:44:13.300
I had like

02:44:13.300 --> 02:44:15.300
almost drunkenly clean up everything

02:44:15.300 --> 02:44:17.300
and like

02:44:17.300 --> 02:44:19.300
there's some drano down and hope that I caught

02:44:19.300 --> 02:44:21.300
rid of it

02:44:21.300 --> 02:44:23.300
and my cats are all around me

02:44:23.300 --> 02:44:25.300
and they know something's wrong

02:44:25.300 --> 02:44:27.300
like rena was

02:44:27.300 --> 02:44:29.300
uh and boomie were like by my side

02:44:29.300 --> 02:44:31.300
fia was like off

02:44:31.300 --> 02:44:33.300
to the side but like

02:44:33.300 --> 02:44:35.300
um rena was always on top of me for that

02:44:35.300 --> 02:44:37.300
shit she's like she was up in my face

02:44:37.300 --> 02:44:39.300
she was checking she was sniffing me she knew

02:44:39.300 --> 02:44:41.300
something was wrong um

02:44:43.300 --> 02:44:45.300
cats were like damn girl you could

02:44:45.300 --> 02:44:47.300
uh

02:44:47.300 --> 02:44:49.300
um

02:44:49.300 --> 02:44:51.300
and then

02:44:51.300 --> 02:44:53.300
I texted my mom right after because I'm like

02:44:53.300 --> 02:44:55.300
mom I don't feel good I don't know what's wrong

02:44:55.300 --> 02:44:57.300
with me uh please just check in with me

02:44:57.300 --> 02:44:59.300
every now and then because I don't know what's wrong

02:44:59.300 --> 02:45:01.300
with me and she's like do we need to take you to urgent care

02:45:01.300 --> 02:45:03.300
and I'm like wait I don't have insurance

02:45:03.300 --> 02:45:05.300
so don't take me to urgent care

02:45:05.300 --> 02:45:07.300
because ambulances are expensive

02:45:07.300 --> 02:45:09.300
y'all

02:45:09.300 --> 02:45:11.300
like 20k in the US

02:45:11.300 --> 02:45:13.300
um

02:45:13.300 --> 02:45:15.300
yeah it's

02:45:15.300 --> 02:45:16.300
it's

02:45:16.300 --> 02:45:18.300
that's why like I didn't tweet a lot

02:45:18.300 --> 02:45:20.300
about what I was fucking dealing with

02:45:20.300 --> 02:45:22.300
because I didn't want you guys to worry

02:45:22.300 --> 02:45:24.300
um

02:45:24.300 --> 02:45:26.300
but yeah it was hard it was tough

02:45:27.300 --> 02:45:29.300
it was bad

02:45:29.300 --> 02:45:31.300
we suffered in America literally

02:45:31.300 --> 02:45:33.300
my friend had a baby she still was like

02:45:33.300 --> 02:45:35.300
30k

02:45:35.300 --> 02:45:37.300
like damn bitch

02:45:37.300 --> 02:45:39.300
um

02:45:39.300 --> 02:45:41.300
but then

02:45:41.300 --> 02:45:43.300
I got up

02:45:43.300 --> 02:45:45.300
cleaned up

02:45:45.300 --> 02:45:47.300
uh

02:45:47.300 --> 02:45:49.300
and just laid on the floor on the cold

02:45:49.300 --> 02:45:51.300
tile

02:45:51.300 --> 02:45:53.300
because I was just

02:45:53.300 --> 02:45:55.300
like I was cold and then I was hot

02:45:55.300 --> 02:45:57.300
so I don't know if I had food poisoning or something

02:45:57.300 --> 02:45:59.300
I don't know

02:45:59.300 --> 02:46:01.300
um

02:46:01.300 --> 02:46:03.300
I literally had just like

02:46:03.300 --> 02:46:05.300
eaten some rice

02:46:05.300 --> 02:46:07.300
and then I had like sweet potatoes

02:46:07.300 --> 02:46:09.300
I don't

02:46:09.300 --> 02:46:11.300
know

02:46:11.300 --> 02:46:13.300
it was so weird

02:46:13.300 --> 02:46:15.300
uh

02:46:15.300 --> 02:46:17.300
and um

02:46:17.300 --> 02:46:19.300
and I had some like dressing on it

02:46:19.300 --> 02:46:21.300
but the dressing isn't

02:46:21.300 --> 02:46:23.300
wasn't bad I literally like had ordered

02:46:23.300 --> 02:46:25.300
food so I'm like

02:46:25.300 --> 02:46:27.300
was the food bad from this place that I ordered from

02:46:27.300 --> 02:46:29.300
again I just

02:46:29.300 --> 02:46:31.300
I don't know

02:46:31.300 --> 02:46:33.300
some rice left out too long to grow some stuff

02:46:33.300 --> 02:46:35.300
yeah that's no

02:46:35.300 --> 02:46:37.300
no wherever she goes

02:46:37.300 --> 02:46:39.300
she's down with the sickness

02:46:39.300 --> 02:46:41.300
oh wow

02:46:41.300 --> 02:46:43.300
but guys

02:46:43.300 --> 02:46:45.300
don't think this doesn't happen on like a daily occurrence

02:46:45.300 --> 02:46:47.300
hello

02:46:47.300 --> 02:46:49.300
hello welcome in

02:46:49.300 --> 02:46:51.300
I has medical expenses

02:46:51.300 --> 02:46:53.300
of thing when someone needs medical attention

02:46:53.300 --> 02:46:55.300
I don't fucking know I hate America for that reason

02:46:55.300 --> 02:46:57.300
she went to fly to another country to get healthcare

02:46:57.300 --> 02:46:59.300
and fly back literally

02:47:03.300 --> 02:47:05.300
is she a doctor?

02:47:05.300 --> 02:47:07.300
I don't know

02:47:07.300 --> 02:47:09.300
I'm not going to say that

02:47:09.300 --> 02:47:11.300
but here's what I'll tell you

02:47:11.300 --> 02:47:13.300
because this is exactly what happened last time

02:47:13.300 --> 02:47:15.300
my throat hurts

02:47:15.300 --> 02:47:17.300
last time this happened to me

02:47:17.300 --> 02:47:19.300
I went to urgent care

02:47:19.300 --> 02:47:21.300
uh

02:47:21.300 --> 02:47:23.300
they gave me the same pills that I have

02:47:23.300 --> 02:47:25.300
just the milk cuisine or whatever it's called

02:47:25.300 --> 02:47:27.300
literally just gave me like over-the-counter

02:47:27.300 --> 02:47:29.300
or uh prescription

02:47:29.300 --> 02:47:31.300
it didn't do shit

02:47:31.300 --> 02:47:33.300
I literally just had to wait it out

02:47:33.300 --> 02:47:35.300
I don't like 300 bucks

02:47:35.300 --> 02:47:37.300
for a waste of my time

02:47:37.300 --> 02:47:39.300
and a waste of gas to tell them to tell me

02:47:39.300 --> 02:47:41.300
oh here's some drugs

02:47:41.300 --> 02:47:43.300
no

02:47:43.300 --> 02:47:45.300
I hate that

02:47:45.300 --> 02:47:47.300
I hate going to the doctor because they literally don't do shit besides

02:47:47.300 --> 02:47:49.300
like you want some drugs and I'm like

02:47:49.300 --> 02:47:51.300
I have been on so many medications

02:47:51.300 --> 02:47:53.300
between my like

02:47:53.300 --> 02:47:55.300
for my mental health, for my physical health

02:47:55.300 --> 02:47:57.300
for my um

02:47:57.300 --> 02:47:59.300
neuropathy

02:47:59.300 --> 02:48:01.300
for like rheumatology issues

02:48:01.300 --> 02:48:03.300
I'm like I'm tired of taking fucking

02:48:03.300 --> 02:48:05.300
pills bro

02:48:05.300 --> 02:48:07.300
I'm trying like

02:48:07.300 --> 02:48:09.300
I would go totally holistic

02:48:09.300 --> 02:48:11.300
if I could because I'm so

02:48:11.300 --> 02:48:13.300
fucking tired of taking pills dude

02:48:13.300 --> 02:48:15.300
um I literally don't

02:48:15.300 --> 02:48:17.300
yeah that's why like that's the only

02:48:17.300 --> 02:48:19.300
like what I was like alright

02:48:19.300 --> 02:48:21.300
I think I have a stabbing pain in my gut

02:48:21.300 --> 02:48:23.300
I'm puking my guts out

02:48:23.300 --> 02:48:25.300
my body's gone cold

02:48:25.300 --> 02:48:27.300
my organs must be shutting down

02:48:27.300 --> 02:48:29.300
I will then

02:48:29.300 --> 02:48:31.300
possibly

02:48:31.300 --> 02:48:33.300
think about getting a

02:48:33.300 --> 02:48:35.300
going to the

02:48:35.300 --> 02:48:37.300
the doctors

02:48:39.300 --> 02:48:41.300
I can see one of those medical recast videos

02:48:41.300 --> 02:48:43.300
getting made, VTuber eats moldy rice

02:48:43.300 --> 02:48:45.300
this is what happened to her body

02:48:45.300 --> 02:48:47.300
I had like moldy bread on accident the other day and I was fine

02:48:47.300 --> 02:48:49.300
I had salmon that was

02:48:49.300 --> 02:48:51.300
left out in water

02:48:51.300 --> 02:48:53.300
defrosting that I forgot

02:48:53.300 --> 02:48:55.300
about I was fine I'm like

02:48:55.300 --> 02:48:57.300
what the fuck is going on I think

02:48:57.300 --> 02:48:59.300
that's why I'm like my mom just said I think

02:48:59.300 --> 02:49:01.300
your body was just so stress

02:49:01.300 --> 02:49:03.300
and you had already had something inside

02:49:03.300 --> 02:49:05.300
that you just your when you finally

02:49:05.300 --> 02:49:07.300
got to relax your body just like couldn't

02:49:07.300 --> 02:49:09.300
take it

02:49:09.300 --> 02:49:11.300
yeah they add up

02:49:11.300 --> 02:49:13.300
only bread

02:49:13.300 --> 02:49:15.300
has pedestal that's fine

02:49:15.300 --> 02:49:17.300
it's some weird thing when I was a state

02:49:17.300 --> 02:49:19.300
very similar to when I've been high for two

02:49:19.300 --> 02:49:21.300
days straight I went to the ER

02:49:21.300 --> 02:49:23.300
waited for three hours for them to tell me it's nothing

02:49:23.300 --> 02:49:25.300
that's so crazy yeah it was so I had

02:49:25.300 --> 02:49:27.300
the spins and I'm like

02:49:27.300 --> 02:49:29.300
I didn't drink anything I don't drink

02:49:29.300 --> 02:49:31.300
because of my medication I only drink for special occasions

02:49:31.300 --> 02:49:33.300
so like I might I usually

02:49:33.300 --> 02:49:35.300
won't take my

02:49:35.300 --> 02:49:37.300
prescription for like a day

02:49:37.300 --> 02:49:39.300
so I don't think it'll interact with it

02:49:41.300 --> 02:49:43.300
and I literally had the spins

02:49:43.300 --> 02:49:45.300
I thought I was on a boat

02:49:45.300 --> 02:49:47.300
and I'm like

02:49:47.300 --> 02:49:49.300
I feel high

02:49:49.300 --> 02:49:51.300
and I'm like if this is what being high is like

02:49:51.300 --> 02:49:53.300
I never want to be high bro

02:49:53.300 --> 02:49:55.300
this fucking sucks

02:49:55.300 --> 02:49:57.300
um the room is spinning my throat is dry

02:49:57.300 --> 02:49:59.300
right now uh sorry

02:50:01.300 --> 02:50:03.300
I'm not used to talking so much again

02:50:03.300 --> 02:50:05.300
I have to get used to yapping

02:50:05.300 --> 02:50:07.300
um

02:50:07.300 --> 02:50:09.300

02:50:09.300 --> 02:50:11.300
my body was like not can't do it

02:50:11.300 --> 02:50:13.300

uh this is

02:52:31.300 --> 02:52:33.300
literally just a one-time thing because I traveled

02:52:33.300 --> 02:52:35.300
and I'm now I know what to look out for

02:52:35.300 --> 02:52:37.300
when I travel again

02:52:37.300 --> 02:52:39.300
and

02:52:39.300 --> 02:52:41.300

02:52:47.300 --> 02:52:49.300
and I'm like if I'm

02:52:49.300 --> 02:52:51.300

02:53:17.300 --> 02:53:19.300
of other people I don't I sometimes ever get to take care

02:53:19.300 --> 02:53:21.300
of myself my mom has told me that before

02:53:21.300 --> 02:53:23.300
um and that's why she was

02:53:23.300 --> 02:53:25.300
happy that I left my last job because

02:53:25.300 --> 02:53:27.300
I was so busy cleaning up other people's messes

02:53:27.300 --> 02:53:29.300
and just like doing stuff for other people

02:53:29.300 --> 02:53:31.300
she's like you need to do something for you

02:53:31.300 --> 02:53:33.300
that gives you energy stop giving

02:53:33.300 --> 02:53:35.300
your energy to other people

02:53:35.300 --> 02:53:37.300
um

02:53:37.300 --> 02:53:39.300
you know stressful things that yeah you guys understand

02:53:39.300 --> 02:53:41.300
with my OCD I need to be in control

02:53:41.300 --> 02:53:43.300
and nothing's in control right now and it's

02:53:43.300 --> 02:53:45.300
not going my way and it's very stressful

02:53:45.300 --> 02:53:47.300
um

02:53:47.300 --> 02:53:49.300
it's very stressful what

02:53:49.300 --> 02:53:51.300

02:53:59.300 --> 02:54:01.300
um

02:54:03.300 --> 02:54:05.300
I don't know that doubts the resilience

02:54:05.300 --> 02:54:07.300
that's my word of the year is resilience I

02:54:07.300 --> 02:54:09.300
aiming I'm aiming to be resilient

02:54:09.300 --> 02:54:11.300

02:54:11.300 --> 02:54:13.300
you plus you know how to don't take anyone's crap

02:54:13.300 --> 02:54:15.300
sometimes I do

02:54:15.300 --> 02:54:17.300
sometimes uh

02:54:17.300 --> 02:54:19.300
yeah like I tweeted something stupid the other day

02:54:19.300 --> 02:54:21.300
and the day after I tweeted it I'm like why the fuck did I tweet that

02:54:21.300 --> 02:54:23.300
like why am I being a little bitch right now

02:54:23.300 --> 02:54:25.300

02:54:27.300 --> 02:54:29.300
but I'm like I just like got distracted

02:54:31.300 --> 02:54:33.300

02:54:35.300 --> 02:54:37.300
you don't have me on my knee

02:54:37.300 --> 02:54:39.300
um

02:54:39.300 --> 02:54:41.300
but yeah it's just like

02:54:41.300 --> 02:54:43.300
it's just

02:54:43.300 --> 02:54:45.300
I'm still dizzy like I'm

02:54:45.300 --> 02:54:47.300
I'm a little nauseous right now

02:54:47.300 --> 02:54:49.300
I'm not nauseous actually I'm just motion sick

02:54:49.300 --> 02:54:51.300
I can't move my head a lot and I'm moving

02:54:51.300 --> 02:54:53.300
I'm gesturing so I need to stop

02:54:53.300 --> 02:54:55.300
um

02:54:55.300 --> 02:54:57.300
I hope you guys like the tan toggle

02:54:57.300 --> 02:54:59.300
I might

02:54:59.300 --> 02:55:01.300
I realize I'm darker like

02:55:01.300 --> 02:55:03.300
on

02:55:03.300 --> 02:55:05.300
whoa

02:55:05.300 --> 02:55:07.300

hello the physics

02:55:11.300 --> 02:55:13.300
um it's I realize I'm lighter

02:55:13.300 --> 02:55:15.300
on one display versus the other

02:55:15.300 --> 02:55:17.300
in my displays they're literally the same freaking

02:55:17.300 --> 02:55:19.300
model but they have differently

02:55:19.300 --> 02:55:21.300
I tried I matched up all like

02:55:21.300 --> 02:55:23.300
the gamma saturation all the shit

02:55:23.300 --> 02:55:25.300
but one's darker than the other it makes no fucking

02:55:25.300 --> 02:55:27.300
sense to me

02:55:27.300 --> 02:55:29.300
um

02:55:29.300 --> 02:55:31.300
but I'm happy you guys

02:55:31.300 --> 02:55:33.300
it's on the other but it's because I'm flipped

02:55:33.300 --> 02:55:35.300
that's why I flipped myself

02:55:35.300 --> 02:55:37.300
I might flip myself back

02:55:43.300 --> 02:55:45.300
tada

02:55:45.300 --> 02:55:47.300
um

02:55:47.300 --> 02:55:49.300

02:57:11.300 --> 02:57:13.300
um

02:57:13.300 --> 02:57:15.300
but I'm glad to be back

02:57:15.300 --> 02:57:17.300
um thank you for letting me vent

02:57:17.300 --> 02:57:19.300
I'm sorry

02:57:19.300 --> 02:57:21.300
uh I really

02:57:21.300 --> 02:57:23.300
I literally like had so many things

02:57:23.300 --> 02:57:25.300
planned for when I came back

02:57:25.300 --> 02:57:27.300
like add some naughty stuff

02:57:27.300 --> 02:57:29.300
they had some normal stuff

02:57:29.300 --> 02:57:31.300
and I haven't been able to do that because it's

02:57:31.300 --> 02:57:33.300
very hard for me to do stuff

02:57:33.300 --> 02:57:35.300
like I'm already very dizzy right now

02:57:35.300 --> 02:57:37.300
I think my brain just

02:57:37.300 --> 02:57:39.300
caught up to all the game

02:57:39.300 --> 02:57:41.300
that I was playing

02:57:41.300 --> 02:57:43.300

I don't have any

02:57:59.300 --> 02:58:01.300
I don't really take pictures of myself because what's the point

02:58:01.300 --> 02:58:03.300
I'm a vtuber

02:58:03.300 --> 02:58:05.300

cute little red dress

02:58:33.300 --> 02:58:35.300
hi

02:58:39.300 --> 02:58:41.300
did you just hear Reina meow

02:58:41.300 --> 02:58:43.300
she's meow back

02:58:43.300 --> 02:58:45.300
she said hello back to me

02:58:51.300 --> 02:58:53.300
I'll give you a hug Reina

02:58:53.300 --> 02:58:55.300
oh thank you for the hug Reina

02:58:55.300 --> 02:58:57.300
dainty bros

02:58:57.300 --> 02:58:59.300
yeah I wasn't wearing a bra

02:58:59.300 --> 02:59:01.300
on that one either so you can kind of see my piercings

02:59:03.300 --> 02:59:05.300
Reina hi

02:59:07.300 --> 02:59:09.300
she's purring love

02:59:09.300 --> 02:59:11.300
Reina knows when I'm stressed out so she just wants to cling to me

02:59:19.300 --> 02:59:21.300
how loud she's purring

02:59:29.300 --> 02:59:31.300
I'm failed by my people

02:59:33.300 --> 02:59:35.300
what else

02:59:35.300 --> 02:59:37.300
the Among Us

02:59:37.300 --> 02:59:39.300
the dainty

02:59:39.300 --> 02:59:41.300
leash

02:59:41.300 --> 02:59:43.300
I regret the other one was oh the cat

02:59:43.300 --> 02:59:45.300
that was me and those little cat paw tights

02:59:45.300 --> 02:59:47.300
a cute little pink dress

02:59:47.300 --> 02:59:49.300
and tail and cat ears

02:59:51.300 --> 02:59:53.300
I don't know I like stepped

02:59:53.300 --> 02:59:55.300
in makeup on those tights

02:59:55.300 --> 02:59:57.300
like literally right after I took the photos

02:59:57.300 --> 02:59:59.300
I remember and I had to it toss them

02:59:59.300 --> 03:00:01.300
I want to get some more cat paw tights

03:00:01.300 --> 03:00:03.300
those are cute

03:00:03.300 --> 03:00:05.300
my little paw pads

03:00:09.300 --> 03:00:11.300
can we have like I just thought of like walking on my toes

03:00:11.300 --> 03:00:13.300
because like walking in the tights

03:00:13.300 --> 03:00:15.300
and like walking the cats walk on their toes

03:00:15.300 --> 03:00:17.300
is it an

03:00:17.300 --> 03:00:19.300
is it an autistic thing

03:00:19.300 --> 03:00:21.300
to walk on your toes so you don't

03:00:21.300 --> 03:00:23.300
make noise

03:00:23.300 --> 03:00:25.300
because I didn't know that

03:00:25.300 --> 03:00:27.300
I don't understand how that's a thing

03:00:27.300 --> 03:00:29.300
Reina what are you doing you got something in your ear

03:00:29.300 --> 03:00:31.300
or so

03:00:31.300 --> 03:00:33.300
because like why is that a thing

03:00:37.300 --> 03:00:39.300
I don't think so yes I think so

03:00:39.300 --> 03:00:41.300
is it I do that

03:00:41.300 --> 03:00:43.300
but I'm not autistic I think

03:00:43.300 --> 03:00:45.300
I think it's somewhat common yeah

03:00:47.300 --> 03:00:49.300
because I don't like making noise when I walk

03:00:49.300 --> 03:00:51.300
okay

03:00:53.300 --> 03:00:55.300
at least I'm not the only person

03:00:55.300 --> 03:00:57.300
that doesn't that does that

03:00:57.300 --> 03:00:59.300
the walks on our toes sometimes

03:01:03.300 --> 03:01:05.300
like I'll just do it in general

03:01:05.300 --> 03:01:07.300
I just don't like making noise when I walk at all

03:01:09.300 --> 03:01:11.300
so I'll walk weird

03:01:11.300 --> 03:01:13.300
my mom says I bounce when I walk

03:01:13.300 --> 03:01:15.300
she's like why are you so bouncy

03:01:15.300 --> 03:01:17.300
just walk normal and I'm like I don't know

03:01:19.300 --> 03:01:21.300
Reina just had to put the mic

03:01:23.300 --> 03:01:25.300
I need to get a little

03:01:25.300 --> 03:01:27.300
cat

03:01:27.300 --> 03:01:29.300
mascot

03:01:29.300 --> 03:01:31.300
in the form of Reina

03:01:33.300 --> 03:01:35.300
because I don't know if I get all three cats

03:01:35.300 --> 03:01:37.300
and just like have them surround me

03:01:39.300 --> 03:01:41.300
she tip toes like a cartoon

03:01:41.300 --> 03:01:43.300
villain yeah exactly

03:01:45.300 --> 03:01:47.300
but yeah I'm very glad

03:01:47.300 --> 03:01:49.300
to

03:01:49.300 --> 03:01:51.300
Reina on your head

03:01:51.300 --> 03:01:53.300
yeah I have one cat under each arm

03:01:53.300 --> 03:01:55.300
and then Reina is just on my head

03:01:55.300 --> 03:01:57.300
I don't know if I can make this model

03:01:57.300 --> 03:01:59.300
and go bald I'll be honest with you

03:01:59.300 --> 03:02:01.300
I'll have to do try to figure out a bald toggle

03:02:07.300 --> 03:02:09.300
they add the cats

03:02:09.300 --> 03:02:11.300
to the family treat no they're not

03:02:11.300 --> 03:02:13.300
they're just my babies they're separate

03:02:13.300 --> 03:02:15.300
they're not part of that mess

03:02:17.300 --> 03:02:19.300
I know people who did that a lot

03:02:19.300 --> 03:02:21.300
don't get surgery later in life

03:02:21.300 --> 03:02:23.300
because doing that messed up their legs

03:02:23.300 --> 03:02:25.300
oh walking in your toes

03:02:27.300 --> 03:02:29.300
oh maybe

03:02:35.300 --> 03:02:37.300
it's called it it's on a family treat

03:02:37.300 --> 03:02:39.300
it's a wreath alright so I'm gonna say

03:02:39.300 --> 03:02:41.300
um

03:02:43.300 --> 03:02:45.300
I don't know what I'm gonna say

03:02:45.300 --> 03:02:47.300
I'm just like

03:02:47.300 --> 03:02:49.300
losing my train of thought

03:02:51.300 --> 03:02:53.300
no wreath

03:02:53.300 --> 03:02:55.300
w-r-e-a-t-h

03:02:55.300 --> 03:02:57.300
wreath

03:02:57.300 --> 03:02:59.300
using a sentence

03:02:59.300 --> 03:03:01.300
my mom made a beautiful Christmas wreath this year

03:03:01.300 --> 03:03:03.300
wreath

03:03:03.300 --> 03:03:05.300
I was good in spelling bees

03:03:05.300 --> 03:03:07.300
so I'm gonna say

03:03:09.300 --> 03:03:11.300
wreath

03:03:11.300 --> 03:03:13.300
they also uh

03:03:13.300 --> 03:03:15.300
when they updated my model for the toggle

03:03:15.300 --> 03:03:17.300
they also changed my mouth tracking

03:03:17.300 --> 03:03:19.300
so it's a little bit weirder and I have to fix it again

03:03:19.300 --> 03:03:21.300
my mouth doesn't open all the way

03:03:21.300 --> 03:03:23.300
it's very odd

03:03:25.300 --> 03:03:27.300
can I get a location of origin

03:03:29.300 --> 03:03:31.300
I don't fucking know well no

03:03:31.300 --> 03:03:33.300
I can't give you an a- they need

03:03:33.300 --> 03:03:35.300
the person who's

03:03:35.300 --> 03:03:37.300
testing you gives a location

03:03:37.300 --> 03:03:39.300
of origin

03:03:39.300 --> 03:03:41.300
velar spelling bee

03:03:41.300 --> 03:03:43.300
strani can't spell

03:03:43.300 --> 03:03:45.300
because she's Scottish

03:03:45.300 --> 03:03:47.300
Azura

03:03:47.300 --> 03:03:49.300
I think would just fall asleep

03:03:49.300 --> 03:03:51.300
and they would go to her turn

03:03:51.300 --> 03:03:53.300
and she'd just be asleep

03:03:53.300 --> 03:03:55.300
uh mercy

03:03:55.300 --> 03:03:57.300
would do well

03:03:59.300 --> 03:04:01.300
emmy

03:04:01.300 --> 03:04:03.300
would only ask for

03:04:03.300 --> 03:04:05.300
words that were inappropriate

03:04:05.300 --> 03:04:07.300
I see would just

03:04:07.300 --> 03:04:09.300
be like

03:04:09.300 --> 03:04:11.300
this is not fair

03:04:11.300 --> 03:04:13.300
English isn't my first language

03:04:13.300 --> 03:04:15.300
after she gets like one word wrong

03:04:15.300 --> 03:04:17.300
and we give her a second

03:04:17.300 --> 03:04:19.300
and she would just be like

03:04:19.300 --> 03:04:21.300
no

03:04:21.300 --> 03:04:23.300
let me so we'd have to like give her like

03:04:25.300 --> 03:04:27.300
Russian words

03:04:27.300 --> 03:04:29.300
haha

03:04:33.300 --> 03:04:35.300
yeah because

03:04:35.300 --> 03:04:37.300
Scottish spelling is very phonetic

03:04:37.300 --> 03:04:39.300
very much like krill

03:04:41.300 --> 03:04:43.300
yeah all my fucking god

03:04:43.300 --> 03:04:45.300
you expect me to spell this shit

03:04:45.300 --> 03:04:47.300
and she just fucking like

03:04:47.300 --> 03:04:49.300
eat something across the room right now

03:04:49.300 --> 03:04:51.300
I just was gonna go put right on the ground

03:04:51.300 --> 03:04:53.300
and she just immediately just

03:04:53.300 --> 03:04:55.300
gripped my shoulder

03:04:55.300 --> 03:04:57.300
um

03:04:57.300 --> 03:04:59.300
but yeah

03:05:03.300 --> 03:05:05.300
it's like a club

03:05:05.300 --> 03:05:07.300
it's funny so

03:05:07.300 --> 03:05:09.300
strani really shouldn't have

03:05:09.300 --> 03:05:11.300
set this up like this

03:05:11.300 --> 03:05:13.300
but she puts all of our models in a drive

03:05:13.300 --> 03:05:15.300
folder

03:05:15.300 --> 03:05:17.300
but

03:05:17.300 --> 03:05:19.300
but I see and Emmys are separate

03:05:19.300 --> 03:05:21.300
so I can't get to their models

03:05:21.300 --> 03:05:23.300
I was like really debating whether or not

03:05:23.300 --> 03:05:25.300
I'm gonna come back and I'm just like

03:05:25.300 --> 03:05:27.300
mercy on the screen

03:05:29.300 --> 03:05:31.300
because if I were I would totally

03:05:31.300 --> 03:05:33.300
yank I see his model and be like

03:05:33.300 --> 03:05:35.300
hello everybody

03:05:37.300 --> 03:05:39.300
oh yeah

03:05:39.300 --> 03:05:41.300
I'm hoping she's getting a well deserved break

03:05:41.300 --> 03:05:43.300
she's been very stressed

03:05:43.300 --> 03:05:45.300
make sure you guys if you're a snowberry

03:05:45.300 --> 03:05:47.300
your dada give her lots of love

03:05:49.300 --> 03:05:51.300
um

03:05:51.300 --> 03:05:53.300
impressions yeah I can I can literally

03:05:53.300 --> 03:05:55.300
only do icy though out of my gen mates

03:05:55.300 --> 03:05:57.300
and then I can kind of do a zero

03:05:57.300 --> 03:05:59.300
everyone swaps models

03:06:01.300 --> 03:06:03.300
um

03:06:05.300 --> 03:06:07.300
I would like show up

03:06:07.300 --> 03:06:09.300
and like

03:06:09.300 --> 03:06:11.300
because I like I could definitely grab like

03:06:11.300 --> 03:06:13.300
mercy's or is there a model or strani's

03:06:13.300 --> 03:06:15.300
I'm very tempted to yank

03:06:15.300 --> 03:06:17.300
because strani has all our models too

03:06:17.300 --> 03:06:19.300
I'm tempted to yank

03:06:19.300 --> 03:06:21.300
because she backs them up for us

03:06:21.300 --> 03:06:23.300
uh strani's model

03:06:23.300 --> 03:06:25.300
when I collab with her

or icy's model as a meme

03:07:13.300 --> 03:07:15.300
although it'd be very funny

03:07:15.300 --> 03:07:17.300
if me and zura were both like cute

03:07:17.300 --> 03:07:19.300
and funny

03:07:19.300 --> 03:07:21.300
and then

03:07:21.300 --> 03:07:23.300

03:07:23.300 --> 03:07:25.300
having strani's model

03:07:27.300 --> 03:07:29.300

03:07:29.300 --> 03:07:31.300
strani's model

03:07:31.300 --> 03:07:33.300
I see with the zura's model I'm just thinking of

03:07:33.300 --> 03:07:35.300
all the combinations it's funny

03:07:35.300 --> 03:07:37.300
mercy would just laugh

03:07:37.300 --> 03:07:39.300
as she would she would just jiggle my boobs

03:07:41.300 --> 03:07:43.300
I'm just gonna use the whip a lot

03:07:46.300 --> 03:07:48.300

03:08:11.300 --> 03:08:13.300

anymore yet no I just got back

03:08:15.300 --> 03:08:17.300
I just got here

03:08:17.300 --> 03:08:19.300
I don't even know where it went oh yeah I shoved

03:08:19.300 --> 03:08:21.300
it in my closet so my mom couldn't find it

03:08:21.300 --> 03:08:23.300
but then I ended up kinda showing her

03:08:23.300 --> 03:08:25.300
where it was because I put the cat

03:08:25.300 --> 03:08:27.300
carrier in the same spot she's like

03:08:27.300 --> 03:08:29.300
what if I need to get the cats out if there's

03:08:29.300 --> 03:08:31.300
emergency and I'm like fuck

03:08:31.300 --> 03:08:33.300
it's in the same spot as I put the whip

03:08:33.300 --> 03:08:35.300
so I had to take out the whip

03:08:35.300 --> 03:08:37.300
and then take out the cat carrier

03:08:37.300 --> 03:08:39.300
and be like it's right here and then put it back

03:08:39.300 --> 03:08:41.300
pretend that everything

03:08:41.300 --> 03:08:43.300
was normal

03:08:43.300 --> 03:08:45.300
how would you power

03:08:45.300 --> 03:08:47.300
scale you and the girls

03:08:47.300 --> 03:08:49.300
based off of what

03:08:49.300 --> 03:08:51.300
Azura

03:08:51.300 --> 03:08:53.300
is gonna be the most powerful she's literally

03:08:53.300 --> 03:08:55.300
god

03:08:55.300 --> 03:08:57.300
so

03:08:57.300 --> 03:08:59.300
um and then

03:08:59.300 --> 03:09:01.300
strongy

03:09:01.300 --> 03:09:03.300
no no and then emmy because of her

03:09:03.300 --> 03:09:05.300
book and then strongy because her hypnotism

03:09:05.300 --> 03:09:07.300
I

03:09:07.300 --> 03:09:09.300
I'm

03:09:09.300 --> 03:09:11.300
literally probably the weakest now

03:09:11.300 --> 03:09:13.300
they think of it I see because

03:09:13.300 --> 03:09:15.300
of her polar bear upbringing

03:09:15.300 --> 03:09:17.300
mercy because she just knows how to kill

03:09:17.300 --> 03:09:19.300
people and torture them

03:09:19.300 --> 03:09:21.300
and me I'm just

03:09:21.300 --> 03:09:23.300
I just do that sexually so I'm like I'm

03:09:23.300 --> 03:09:25.300
I yeah

03:09:25.300 --> 03:09:27.300
I guess I'm the weakest

03:09:27.300 --> 03:09:29.300
affection meter

03:09:29.300 --> 03:09:31.300
um

03:09:31.300 --> 03:09:33.300
she was just

03:09:33.300 --> 03:09:35.300
I'm just some girl I'm just some bunny girl

03:09:35.300 --> 03:09:37.300
that runs a hotel

03:09:37.300 --> 03:09:39.300
bro

03:09:39.300 --> 03:09:41.300
I'm just freaky canonical

03:09:41.300 --> 03:09:43.300
I'm literally the only freaky one canonically

03:09:43.300 --> 03:09:45.300
everybody else is normal

03:09:45.300 --> 03:09:47.300
like if you really think about it I'm the actual

03:09:47.300 --> 03:09:49.300
one that's like on the nose for my

03:09:49.300 --> 03:09:51.300
my my uh my niche

03:09:51.300 --> 03:09:53.300
um for affection

03:09:57.300 --> 03:09:59.300
hmm that's a tough one

03:09:59.300 --> 03:10:01.300
I would say

03:10:03.300 --> 03:10:05.300
who's the most affectionate

03:10:05.300 --> 03:10:07.300
for their fans

03:10:07.300 --> 03:10:09.300
I would honestly say that

03:10:09.300 --> 03:10:11.300
me and strongy are tied

03:10:11.300 --> 03:10:13.300
at the top

03:10:13.300 --> 03:10:15.300
then emmy

03:10:15.300 --> 03:10:17.300
then I see

03:10:19.300 --> 03:10:21.300
the mercy and azura

03:10:21.300 --> 03:10:23.300
I think that's how I do it

03:10:25.300 --> 03:10:27.300
I think

03:10:27.300 --> 03:10:29.300
me and

03:10:29.300 --> 03:10:31.300
strongy are very similar in our

03:10:31.300 --> 03:10:33.300
affection

03:10:37.300 --> 03:10:39.300
yeah it's hard to rank that because

03:10:39.300 --> 03:10:41.300
we all like show our affection in different

03:10:41.300 --> 03:10:43.300
ways

03:10:45.300 --> 03:10:47.300
mercy was an ex student yeah but she

03:10:47.300 --> 03:10:49.300
fucking kills people

03:10:49.300 --> 03:10:51.300
um

03:10:51.300 --> 03:10:53.300
because me and strongy

03:10:53.300 --> 03:10:55.300
I think

03:10:55.300 --> 03:10:57.300
are very

03:10:57.300 --> 03:10:59.300
and yes I'll use this term

03:10:59.300 --> 03:11:01.300
just because of how we are like we just

03:11:01.300 --> 03:11:03.300
like spending time with you

03:11:03.300 --> 03:11:05.300
um and we just talk a lot and we just want to

03:11:05.300 --> 03:11:07.300
hang out and play games with you

03:11:07.300 --> 03:11:09.300
um

03:11:09.300 --> 03:11:11.300
emmy is as different because

03:11:11.300 --> 03:11:13.300
again it's familial

03:11:13.300 --> 03:11:15.300
and a little like

03:11:15.300 --> 03:11:17.300
it's yeah it's

03:11:17.300 --> 03:11:19.300
really hard

03:11:19.300 --> 03:11:21.300
to

03:11:21.300 --> 03:11:23.300
kind of because everybody kind of expresses

03:11:23.300 --> 03:11:25.300
themselves in different ways

03:11:29.300 --> 03:11:31.300
I don't know if she be you can just pull off

03:11:31.300 --> 03:11:33.300
your own voice and make someone do whatever you want

03:11:33.300 --> 03:11:35.300
that's true I liked so like in my

03:11:35.300 --> 03:11:37.300
PL I love switching my voice up because

03:11:37.300 --> 03:11:39.300
people would come in and I'd be like hi everybody

03:11:39.300 --> 03:11:41.300
my name is uh Rana Noi

03:11:41.300 --> 03:11:43.300
and today we're just playing

03:11:43.300 --> 03:11:45.300
whatever the fuck I was playing at the time

03:11:45.300 --> 03:11:47.300
and um

03:11:47.300 --> 03:11:49.300
then

03:11:49.300 --> 03:11:51.300
they'd be like oh how's it going I'd be like it's

03:11:51.300 --> 03:11:53.300
going fine thank you

03:11:53.300 --> 03:11:55.300
and they're just like

03:11:55.300 --> 03:11:57.300

03:12:03.300 --> 03:12:05.300
Laurie

03:12:05.300 --> 03:12:07.300
I can't even do my higher pitch voice right now because

03:12:07.300 --> 03:12:09.300
it's already my throat is dry

03:12:09.300 --> 03:12:11.300
I don't know if my air is dry in my house

03:12:11.300 --> 03:12:13.300
Rana why are you just staring at my go XLR

03:12:13.300 --> 03:12:15.300
like you're gonna do something

03:12:15.300 --> 03:12:17.300
she's

03:12:17.300 --> 03:12:19.300
squeaked because I poked her but

meow instead of a sessu

03:12:25.300 --> 03:12:27.300
sometimes just like silent meow she's like

03:12:27.300 --> 03:12:29.300
like you can't hear it

03:12:29.300 --> 03:12:31.300
she'll just open her mouth and like let out a

03:12:31.300 --> 03:12:33.300
squeak like the light side a silence

03:12:33.300 --> 03:12:35.300
squeak Rana speak to the people

03:12:39.300 --> 03:12:41.300
that's not speaking to the people

03:12:41.300 --> 03:12:43.300
you're just rubbing against the mic she went

03:12:45.300 --> 03:12:47.300
Rana

03:12:47.300 --> 03:12:49.300
no yes actually meow and stop

03:12:49.300 --> 03:12:51.300

03:12:55.300 --> 03:12:57.300
whisper meowing

03:12:57.300 --> 03:12:59.300
Rana

03:13:03.300 --> 03:13:05.300
Rana

03:13:05.300 --> 03:13:07.300
she just did it again she just whisper

03:13:07.300 --> 03:13:09.300
meowing and whisper purring

03:13:09.300 --> 03:13:11.300
that's what she does

03:13:11.300 --> 03:13:13.300
she just opens her mouth and goes

03:13:17.300 --> 03:13:19.300
if I put her in the ground maybe she'll meow

03:13:23.300 --> 03:13:25.300
Rana

03:13:25.300 --> 03:13:27.300
raise your voice

03:13:27.300 --> 03:13:29.300

03:13:37.300 --> 03:13:39.300
he heard that oh hello again

03:13:39.300 --> 03:13:41.300
Rana just hopped on my desk and back on my lap

03:13:41.300 --> 03:13:43.300

doesn't Rana mean queen in Spanish

03:13:47.300 --> 03:13:49.300
or is that a coincidence

03:13:49.300 --> 03:13:51.300
it is it's spelled R E

03:13:51.300 --> 03:13:53.300
Rana

03:13:53.300 --> 03:13:55.300
queen in Spanish

03:13:55.300 --> 03:13:57.300
but that's not how I spell her name

03:13:57.300 --> 03:13:59.300
excuse me I'm so sorry

03:13:59.300 --> 03:14:01.300
it's the lean game

03:14:01.300 --> 03:14:03.300
I'm drinking the lean game ourselves

03:14:03.300 --> 03:14:05.300
and I'm not even joking this shit is delicious

03:14:05.300 --> 03:14:07.300
like

03:14:07.300 --> 03:14:09.300
I usually don't like mix drinks

03:14:09.300 --> 03:14:11.300
like shake your drinks but I'm like

03:14:11.300 --> 03:14:13.300
this slaps

03:14:15.300 --> 03:14:17.300
I ripped earlier

03:14:17.300 --> 03:14:19.300
it's really good it's like I love peach

03:14:19.300 --> 03:14:21.300
stuff and peach lemonade

03:14:21.300 --> 03:14:23.300
no I'm not drinking lean like I'm not drinking

03:14:23.300 --> 03:14:25.300
actual lean

03:14:25.300 --> 03:14:27.300
bro

03:14:27.300 --> 03:14:29.300

03:14:29.300 --> 03:14:31.300
um no I'm drinking

03:14:31.300 --> 03:14:33.300
the gamer subs flavor lean

03:14:33.300 --> 03:14:35.300
it's peach lemonade flavor it's very good

03:14:35.300 --> 03:14:37.300
it's caffeine free

03:14:37.300 --> 03:14:39.300
I'm so happy I took the caffeine free one

03:14:39.300 --> 03:14:41.300
because I probably wouldn't sleep

03:14:43.300 --> 03:14:45.300
yeah I'm leaning to the side

03:14:45.300 --> 03:14:47.300
because I have motion sickness

03:14:47.300 --> 03:14:49.300
um

03:14:49.300 --> 03:14:51.300
it's really tasty

03:14:51.300 --> 03:14:53.300
um and then

03:14:53.300 --> 03:14:55.300
I usually don't like tropical

03:14:55.300 --> 03:14:57.300
flavors but I tasted

03:14:57.300 --> 03:14:59.300
the

03:14:59.300 --> 03:15:01.300
the shyly

03:15:01.300 --> 03:15:03.300
flavor and it's so good

03:15:03.300 --> 03:15:05.300
and then the other one I think it's like

03:15:05.300 --> 03:15:07.300
strawberry lime or like sour

03:15:07.300 --> 03:15:09.300

03:15:11.300 --> 03:15:13.300
the gorilla one I don't know what it's called

03:15:13.300 --> 03:15:15.300

03:15:15.300 --> 03:15:17.300

just in my chat screaming

03:16:15.300 --> 03:16:17.300
my code every time he has the chance to

03:16:17.300 --> 03:16:19.300
um yeah

03:16:19.300 --> 03:16:21.300
I definitely need to fix the rigging around my mouth

03:16:21.300 --> 03:16:23.300
because I'm not as

03:16:23.300 --> 03:16:25.300
and I'm I'm I'm emoting

03:16:25.300 --> 03:16:27.300
as much as I normally do

03:16:27.300 --> 03:16:29.300
so I don't know why

03:16:29.300 --> 03:16:31.300
unless I over exaggerate

03:16:33.300 --> 03:16:35.300
so I definitely need to fix my physics

03:16:35.300 --> 03:16:37.300
I have my uh cover up

03:16:37.300 --> 03:16:39.300
for my boobies coming soon

03:16:39.300 --> 03:16:41.300
I'm going to be

03:16:41.300 --> 03:16:43.300
um

03:16:43.300 --> 03:16:45.300
what's it called

03:16:47.300 --> 03:16:49.300
my chest will be covered

03:16:49.300 --> 03:16:51.300
and I'll look like a normal businesswoman

03:16:51.300 --> 03:16:53.300
hahaha

03:16:53.300 --> 03:16:55.300
they're not going away

03:16:55.300 --> 03:16:57.300
it's just a toggle

03:16:57.300 --> 03:16:59.300
my

03:16:59.300 --> 03:17:01.300
my chocolatey boobs

03:17:01.300 --> 03:17:03.300

I need to brush your teeth again

03:17:17.300 --> 03:17:19.300
she just looked at me like I offended her

03:17:23.300 --> 03:17:25.300
um yeah

03:17:25.300 --> 03:17:27.300
I definitely need to change the coloring

03:17:27.300 --> 03:17:29.300
on the model

03:17:29.300 --> 03:17:31.300
because I like it looks lighter on one screen

03:17:31.300 --> 03:17:33.300
but it's darker on the other so I might lighten myself up a little bit

03:17:33.300 --> 03:17:35.300
for a little bit

03:17:35.300 --> 03:17:37.300
for a little bit

03:17:37.300 --> 03:17:39.300
copy um yeah as a game or something

03:17:39.300 --> 03:17:41.300
Reyna's stinky

03:17:41.300 --> 03:17:43.300
Reyna got a stinky breath

03:17:45.300 --> 03:17:47.300

03:17:51.300 --> 03:17:53.300

03:18:05.300 --> 03:18:07.300

03:18:07.300 --> 03:18:09.300
on and off

03:18:09.300 --> 03:18:11.300
I'll probably just use it for thumbnails

03:18:11.300 --> 03:18:13.300

a cover up too hers looks fucking sexy though

03:18:19.300 --> 03:18:21.300
I was like I think this

03:18:21.300 --> 03:18:23.300
is just making her look more hot

03:18:23.300 --> 03:18:25.300
to be honest with you

03:18:25.300 --> 03:18:27.300
um

03:18:27.300 --> 03:18:29.300
but yeah YouTube hasn't been kind to us

03:18:29.300 --> 03:18:31.300

I didn't realize how pale I was

03:18:53.300 --> 03:18:55.300

03:18:57.300 --> 03:18:59.300
and if I turn off that

03:18:59.300 --> 03:19:01.300
I'm like

03:19:01.300 --> 03:19:03.300
I don't remember being this pale

03:19:03.300 --> 03:19:05.300
I don't remember being

03:19:05.300 --> 03:19:07.300
I'm like really white

03:19:09.300 --> 03:19:11.300
I don't remember being this white

03:19:11.300 --> 03:19:13.300
I swear I was a little darker than this

03:19:15.300 --> 03:19:17.300

03:19:37.300 --> 03:19:39.300
cause like

03:19:39.300 --> 03:19:41.300
it's so weird I bet if I loaded

03:19:41.300 --> 03:19:43.300
it in my old model it would look hold on

03:19:43.300 --> 03:19:45.300
I'm testing this Reina I need to put you on the floor

03:19:45.300 --> 03:19:47.300

03:19:47.300 --> 03:19:49.300
trying to turn around to get back on my shoulder

03:19:51.300 --> 03:19:53.300
I'm testing it

03:20:01.300 --> 03:20:03.300
ignore what my model looks like

03:20:05.300 --> 03:20:07.300
just ignore that

03:20:09.300 --> 03:20:11.300
see I swear

03:20:13.300 --> 03:20:15.300

03:20:15.300 --> 03:20:17.300
you being like that

03:20:17.300 --> 03:20:19.300

03:20:23.300 --> 03:20:25.300
I swear I'm not as bright

03:20:27.300 --> 03:20:29.300
and now my model is more

03:20:29.300 --> 03:20:31.300
like you could tell by the

03:20:31.300 --> 03:20:33.300
the mouth tracking is a little bit better

03:20:33.300 --> 03:20:35.300
and more responsive

03:20:35.300 --> 03:20:37.300
actually let me look at the settings for that right now

03:20:37.300 --> 03:20:39.300
