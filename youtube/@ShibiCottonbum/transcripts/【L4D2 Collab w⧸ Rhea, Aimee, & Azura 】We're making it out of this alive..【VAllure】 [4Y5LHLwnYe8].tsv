7588880	7593360	like every friday I'll I'll probably do like a um
7595680	7600560	uh an audio but not I don't know if I'll be able to get away with anything
7600800	7607280	ooh alternative but um I don't think I will be in the mood to do that
7612800	7618400	I was flying prena oh it was great it was amazing now I have to take off my shoes I didn't have to
7618400	7625760	do that before um I also get really bad ear pain being on an airplane and that's why
7626480	7631040	I don't like flying the last two the last place I traveled to you know yeah I drove
7631040	7634640	I drove to Canada with friends that was fun you drove to Montreal
7637440	7641760	and then I've driven to New York before with my parents
7643600	7646160	yeah I also have to figure out I don't even know because like
7648000	7650480	I don't know I've asked my parents if they're gonna drive me to the airport
7650720	7656960	I don't know I have to make sure my grandparents are my aunt because I have also
7656960	7660720	have aunt and uncles they live down there so I'm gonna try to see
7663680	7671120	firm yeah yeah TSA gets feet for free yeah I have I get really bad ear pain because one of
7671120	7674240	my eustachian tubes is kind of sort of blocked because of my arthritis in my neck because of
7674240	7679280	inflammation and all that other shit I've told you that before um so my ears really hurt so I'm
7679280	7686640	gonna buy like a pack of gum hope for the best my mom has flown a lot she flew a lot for work um so
7686640	7692880	she has a lot of she's already written me like a lot of advice um I it's so weird because I feel
7692880	7701840	like a little kid again I feel like I am 16 15 again I forget how old I was flying to go see
7701840	7708240	my grandparents and I was terrified back then and I'm terrified but they're older now they can't
7708240	7712320	really fly so it's not it's better for me to travel rather than them
7717280	7722000	hi I'm sorry I'm sorry I missed you guys too but you know like I'll tweet a bunch
7722960	7728880	have shorts I have an ASMR I think I'm gonna do like a ear cleaning ASMR um
7730640	7736080	I'm trying to think I might I'm debating whether or not to like pre-record like some
7736080	7742400	Hades gameplay or something um just so you guys like have a video that goes up and it's me playing
7742400	7749920	or maybe meet just like a totally different game um like I'll play something else like a
7749920	7755840	do a little like pseudo playthrough style thing and just do a quick like one shot of something
7755840	7761920	and have that up as well just so you guys don't get too lonely um I see you think of a game to play
7761920	7767360	so if you have any suggestions let me know yeah don't worry it's I won't I don't leave for eight
7767360	7775040	days I don't I don't leave till the 18th y'all that's all indie playthrough yeah don't worry I
7775040	7778800	just want to tell you guys in advance I didn't want to come first talk to be like surprise I'm
7778800	7783760	not gonna be around but it's like it's halfway through the week so you still it won't feel
7783760	7791280	too much like a week I don't think because like I'm leaving on I think a Friday or Thursday and
7791280	7796880	I'm coming back on a Tuesday so it's just like kind of you guys almost won't have me for like a
7796880	7808560	weekend or something Hoonipop no I want to play Hoonipop on blue twitch with no sensors um but
7808560	7814640	yeah I just didn't I don't want you guys to stress um I'll probably just be like tweeting from the
7814640	7818400	plane just like screaming in my head like just maybe I'll have a twitter space and be talking to
7818400	7826480	myself like a crazy person next to the I got a window seat on the way there but I'm in the middle
7826480	7834000	on the way back which I'm gonna hate I hope I'm not sitting next to weird people because I will
7834000	7839600	try to outweard them so that I feel safer
7840560	7841200	uh

7916720	7923360	at like 12 at night and if you hear screaming don't worry about it but my grandparents would
7923520	7929040	be absolutely mortified if they heard me streaming because they are very christian
7930480	7932960	and if they heard me swear I'd feel so bad
7937280	7941680	if I could tell you the funny shit my my grandparents say because they're so christian
7942720	7943760	I love them to death though
7945600	7948800	reminds me of a lady going I've seen people talk about how they used to next to a hot person
7948800	7952880	in an airplane so if I haven't had that her friend thought she doesn't know she's the hot person
7952880	7962240	oh I hope I'm the hot person flight simulators help you yeah I like I'm not scared of flying
7962240	7966560	I'm just scared of things out of my control like when I can't control a situation
7967520	7974800	that it frightens me I prefer safety start one of those prayer circles they just exercise me
7977680	7981520	how do they feel if they saw a sexy muppet um honestly I don't think they would worry about it
7981520	7985280	that much because my grandparents really love them up it's like my grandmother especially
7985280	7993440	I think they have like all the things on like DVD and uh they probably think be like oh this is
7993440	7996640	like Miss Piggy or something and it has boobs I don't know
8000240	8003440	man I need to ask you I'm going to the beach soon do you want me to keep my
8004240	8009280	even in the water no you don't have to wear it if you don't have to wear it in the water
8010240	8015040	um I'm not if it can you can wear it in the water then that's cool but like again um
8016400	8018240	I don't want you to like break it or lose it
8020640	8024640	just know that if you do it like tightly a market leaves this from me
8025520	8029520	this is why you are dumb don't like to lose the control oh yeah that's a good point
8029520	8034320	yeah I hate losing control I generally do if I can't control a situation I get very upset
8034320	8039520	so where am I it's gonna be weird not having she be holding on to my leash
8040080	8045120	yeah I'm passing the reins over to Strani so she'll be she's she's educated in that
8046400	8052080	I've already handed over your keys to her uh to your cages so you'll be fine
8053280	8059120	mercy will also be keeping an eye um on the hair members that are trapped in my cage
8059120	8064320	because she is also knowledgeable at cages but don't worry you guys will be well loved
8064320	8074240	and well taken care of make sure mercy feeds you don't worry um yeah I'm gonna miss my cat so much
8074240	8079600	I remember my every time I see my grandmother she like makes fun of me because the last time I was
8079600	8086240	there um and this is when I had um Reina and Solea Solea being Reina's sister before she passed away
8086960	8092880	and I was there so I was I was staying with my grandparents for a month um but I left like
8092880	8098000	I think like a couple days or a week early because I just miss Reina and Solea so much
8098000	8102640	so it's literally gonna be so hard for me to be away from all my cats it's I don't know
8104000	8108640	I don't know how people do it like often if I could travel with them I would
8109680	8112640	I think the only cat that would be okay with traveling would be
8113600	8118480	actually none of them Fia's been kind of scared lately for some reason every time I open the door
8118480	8121680	she like runs and I'm like did someone like come into my apartment like a maintenance guy when
8121680	8125040	I wasn't here again and like scare the shit out of my cat like why are she scared every time I open
8125040	8134720	the door it's really weird um but otherwise I would say I would would have said Fia Reina actually
8134720	8140000	might chill Reina will just like really hey what's up Reina's doing well she's healing up well I was
8140000	8148720	looking at her but um if I could show you guys the before and after of what her the gash on her
8148720	8156080	fucking leg looked like um from her anal gland rupturing you guys would be absolutely horrified
8156080	8162320	because it looked like she got shot right next to her booty cheek um but she it's literally uh
8163120	8167680	scabbed over now it looks really good she's doing really well she's very I was recording
8167680	8175200	video this morning of her playing I'll probably post it um she's been yeah she's sleeping on a chair
8175200	8179200	I'm like turning around um and losing tracking because I'm looking at her she's across the room
8180000	8184800	um and then yeah boomy boomy's you know a menace as per usual nothing you're there
8186080	8190240	cats are intuitive you know these moving countries are a little more than usual things
8190960	8193520	happen yeah um
8196640	8200400	yeah Reina I feel like Reina I'm really worried about Reina because Reina is definitely like
8200400	8207600	imprinted on me um my voice is cracking a little bit because I'm sad talking about it um so I'm
8207600	8212800	gonna miss her a lot because she's my cat but thankfully she also loves my mom a lot so but
8212800	8218320	she sees my mom she's gonna be really happy um she loves hanging out with my mom when my mom came
8218320	8225760	over last she uh she was like really excited to see her and it was it's funny how you like is my
8225760	8234160	she hadn't seen Reina in like probably a couple months like quite like six months and my mom's
8234160	8238160	like she's forgotten me and I'm like no she hasn't I've had her since she was a kid and she knows
8238160	8244720	anywhere um but yeah she's really great she's healing my grandparents have pets no my grandparents
8244720	8249200	have never had pets because they're the type of people that think animals are meant to be outside
8249200	8256960	at all times um that was funny the first time my grandpa so these are my Haitian grandparents
8257600	8263840	um so they they also have you know that that they have like Haitian accents um
8265600	8273440	like my grandfather almost like it's more like a french accent and uh so back like I remember
8273440	8278960	a couple years ago when my grandparents first saw Reina Reina used to be a really fat cat unless
8278960	8283200	until she recently lost a lot of weight because of her age and she just can't like she used to be
8283200	8288960	like like 17 pounds I'm not even kidding you we I will post pictures of when she was very large
8291120	8297280	and so my grandfather saw her the first time she like walked out from like uh this is when I
8297280	8302320	lived at my parents house and then she walked out from like behind a wall or something and my
8302320	8308960	grandfather goes oh look at her she is pregnant wow she's what a beautiful cat you're gonna have
8308960	8319920	beautiful kittens and I'm like poppy no she's not pregnant she's not pregnant
8323360	8328000	yeah Reina was a thicker I still thick um I used to I used to I used to call her Miss Chonk
8328560	8332240	she'll she'll always be fat to me even though she's like normal cat size now
8332960	8341200	yeah he definitely fat shamed her um but yeah I haven't even told my grandparents like I quit
8341200	8346960	my job yet so it's gonna be kind of awkward having that conversation my grandfather texted me yesterday
8346960	8353600	he's like hey how's it going I can't wait blah blah blah and I'm just like it's going great I can't
8353600	8363680	wait to see you soon because I know I like they are they're very traditional um
8365360	8369920	like I know they were kind of upset that I didn't go to college because my grandfather was gonna
8369920	8375200	pay for my college until but then I went a little um I took a gap year and then he didn't but yeah
8375200	8380880	it's a whole fake thing um they don't know what I do now only my parents do and some and like two
8380880	8387120	my two best friends all of in Salem have you guys uh I've mentioned to you often um my grandparents
8387120	8395360	don't know my former employer knows because I was just like yeah fuck you guys I'm gonna go be a big
8395360	8405520	streamer no I didn't say that uh they don't have old country value oh yeah um it's like boy or
8405520	8410960	kettlebell that's cute yeah the oh they only want I never take it personally they only ever want
8411600	8417920	what's best for me um if I told them anything that I did they'd probably be absolutely mortified
8419440	8426720	I'd be like she's living in sin um yeah they won't be I'll probably skirt around the topic and be
8426720	8430560	like oh you know like because I remember when I tweeted that tweet like oh what do I tell people
8431280	8439680	that I do I'm just gonna be like I uh work for a startup social media company but I'm under
8439680	8444720	NDA so I can't say anything and then they'll be like oh okay and I rather they won't like they
8444720	8454000	won't usually when I'm there I make them talk a lot so uh probably Morgan
8454160	8464560	okay I'll tell you one funny thing that my grandfather has said
8466160	8473120	so my grandparents were here last they um they came why did they come for did I think
8473120	8477200	they did they come from like one of my parents anniversaries or something and my mom flew
8477200	8482480	them up as a surprise I think I think so I can't remember so I'm going and my grandparents were
8482560	8489440	staying um with my with my family for about like a week week and a half or two weeks I can't really
8489440	8494320	remember and so my grandfather's like oh I want to go get some and my grandfather's the type he's
8494320	8499200	always like wear slacks he's always was like wearing a polo he's very well-dressed man he used to be
8499200	8509760	a Spanish teacher in Haiti and um he uh so we're looking for pants for him and with my grandmother
8509760	8517440	just me him and my grandmother and he's just like looking at all these like slacks and he's like
8518080	8524560	why are all these pants so skinny what they're what is this these cockscrew pants they're
8524560	8533520	trying to look at my back sides I cannot believe them it is the homosexuals they want to see my
8533520	8540400	back sides and they want to grab my back side I'm like poppy no I don't think I don't think the
8540400	8551120	gays want anything to do with you he's like you never know you never know what they want I'm like
8551120	8557360	poppy please remind you like my my my grandparents don't know also that I'm pansexual either I'm not
8557360	8562400	there's no need to tell like that's this person to me I don't they don't know but I think I think
8562480	8566640	it would be very funny if I was just like I said right there and then I'm like you know
8568960	8570720	it would have been funny yeah you like my accent
8573280	8578000	yeah I'm like I don't think nobody wants to look and it's like and this and this happened later
8578000	8581680	because we went shopping and he brought it up later to my parents because my parents asked him
8581680	8585280	when we had a lot of other family over because like my family's all over the place and we all
8585280	8590720	like came to my parents house and and like my parents family friends from their church and stuff
8591600	8597360	and my grandfather is telling the story of this really short pants that's really tight
8597920	8601840	skinny pants like skinny jeans and stuff and like skinnier slacks like they're really like
8602960	8607360	whatever I don't really know how what they're called um and he's telling it to the group
8607360	8612880	as we're like at my parents house around the fire and my mom is just looking mortified
8613520	8618400	she's trying not to laugh so hard because like my parents my parents don't like my parents a lot
8618400	8626640	more lax but my grandparents are hardcore like values like traditional uh biblical values my
8626640	8633200	parents a little bit more lax so my mom is just like like redacted redacted it's fine don't worry
8633200	8638800	about it like you did I hope you found better pants anyways is anybody you want some uh potato
8638800	8640160	salad is anybody
8647280	8651360	I think my family has gotten worse this time to be these last liver when I was a kid
8652400	8656080	oh I just take yeah my parents were a lot more conservative and now they just like really don't
8656080	8662960	give a shit anymore um I don't really care either way I just I don't have the energy to hate
8663920	8666800	that's not my problem I don't care um
8669120	8672160	that's my grandparents my parents are chill my parents are chill
8673840	8678160	my parents are very chill um they kind of just do their own thing
8680160	8685520	my mom is the type of uh Christian woman where she
8687920	8690560	she says oh as long as nobody's hurting anyone
8691440	8693520	and people are just showing each other with love and respect
8695280	8697120	um that's all she could ever ask for
8700720	8705200	hating is too much effort for nothing exactly I just don't I just don't have the energy
8705840	8711120	even like people like really disagree with me or like have a totally different world view I'm
8711120	8717040	just like I don't care speaking of which if you don't follow my alt twitter I said to read
8717040	8721200	and this is why I have this mindset is because of this book I read the four agreements um
8722640	8728400	because I sometimes I get I used to get so caught up with what people thought of me
8729040	8736240	and how they spoke to me and how they did this this and that and like that book helped me so much
8736240	8740080	I highly recommend it um and it's it's written in such a
8740240	8747200	like lazy way that it's like it sounds like you're just talking to someone and they're just like
8747920	8752720	you know like you got to stop assuming stuff about people because when you assume it becomes
8752720	8758560	miscommunications and like it's just it's just really funny how it's written um but I believe
8758560	8762320	it's only like eight bucks off amazon it's a very good book
8762320	8771920	I love doing that I like go XLRs like lit up very oddly whatever um
8774320	8780480	but yeah yeah yeah it's a good book I remember and I'm not you know afraid to say this um when I
8780480	8789440	was younger I was hospitalized because mental Illinois and um uh they had like flash cards of
8789440	8795040	that and then and I always I always liked because they're like kind of just like affirmations you
8795040	8800800	would say and just like what you could think about um to like kind of like improve and stuff
8801600	8805760	and then when I left in like years and years and years had passed and I could never remember
8805760	8810080	what it was called and then I walked into this random ass store and I saw the book and I was like
8810080	8817120	holy shit and I immediately bought it and it's just it's just a good book when I was my young boy
8818080	8821680	yeah it's just like uh I'm not usually like a self-help book person I think that's kind of
8821680	8827440	bullshit but I gave it a try and I liked it um my mom's very much a self-help book person
8829360	8832240	but I love that about her because then she always gives me good advice I'm like you can
8832240	8837840	consume it and then you can just give it back to me in a easier to digest format um
8837840	8848240	um I hate Illinois yeah I was like super young now I don't know what the fuck was going on um
8848240	8853440	the subtle ardent oh yeah I think my mom has that book because my mom if I could show you just like
8853440	8862000	that stack of books my mom has about self-help and nutrition because my mom loves good nutrition
8862000	8864480	um
8867920	8873360	metallic Illinois yeah normally all everybody has a little dash in metallic in Illinois um
8874160	8878320	yeah I always I'll always recommend you guys books that I think will help you or think that you
8878320	8884480	might enjoy or I'll tell you if I think they're like silly like oh read this smut book just like
8884480	8892640	how um how emi does uh I don't know mercy does mercy read I don't know I I know she reads I'm
8892640	8898240	just wondering if she reads that type of book I can't recall I think she does make a little book club
8900800	8905920	I know strongy reads a lot uh a lot of I can't remember if she reads all like nonfiction which
8905920	8910720	surprised me because she like really loves lord of the rings I like how I'm talking about mercy
8910720	8916640	and then right on my screen something she just says she tweeted something called just saying yes
8916640	8924000	and that kind of freaked me out it was like she was talking to me um because I have everyone's
8924000	8932240	notifications turned on for all the girls um I'm looking forward to more recommendations yeah yeah
8932240	8937840	I don't I'll probably yeah she likes this deck yeah she likes thrillers she likes thrillers she's in
8937840	8945840	the walls um and I read a lot of high fantasy so I might uh I haven't read any thing in a while I'm
8945840	8951280	reading that book um feather so vicious that emi recommended when she first tweeted about it
8952240	8956080	because I like bullied her into telling me I was like what she's like I don't know if you can handle
8956080	8966000	this I'm like girl I read cadence by Colleen Hoover and that is a that's that's a book for the
8966000	8972640	pin pals right there if I have any pin pals in the chat read cadence um all I'm gonna say is
8975120	8976160	cousins and an uncle
8979520	8985200	Lord Colleen Hoover is a menace fact I like Verity oh I think I might recommend Verity
8985760	8990960	to no she's like she's not she's not a super good author I'm not even I'm not saying she's a good
8990960	8997440	author by the way she I'm not saying that it's like if you just want to like read something silly
9000000	9007120	calling Hoover Hoover Hoover whatever the frick her name is is your girl um I think she would
9007120	9012400	like I think Mercy would like Verity because it is a mystery it's like a what happened to this man's
9012400	9018240	wife is the main character going crazy who I should also recommend the silent patient to Mercy but
9018240	9023200	I bet she's already read that I love I love recommending books to people it's one of my favorites
9024640	9032160	oh I feel like fantasy I read it was the speaker spear wielder trilogy oh I've never heard of that
9033520	9039280	my dad has been harassing me to read the third binding which is pretty much literally
9041680	9047680	the king killer chronicles in a different font um I like for I read like an audio I listened to
9047680	9052480	the audiobook for the first two chapters and I hated the audiobook reader that I just stopped
9052480	9060480	reading it um I think it's so funny when this person says hey they're beautiful babe and then
9060480	9069040	people in the chat respond to it okay you're all beautiful babes I just I've always thought that
9069040	9073360	was funny when that happened a book recommendation would be right before your vacay kind of a book
9073440	9077680	report stream after your vacay no I would be traumatized never say book report to me again oh
9077680	9082880	my god this shit I had to go through because it's funny I like to read a lot but I hated doing
9083600	9089520	what was assigned to me during school for book reports and stuff it was my least favorite thing
9089520	9095520	and like but I ended up like in hindsight I wish I had kind of focused more in the classics because
9095520	9099520	you know you read like Huckbury Finn while that shit and like Catcher in the Rye I kind of want
9099520	9103920	to go back and try to read those books again um because I didn't really I kind of just sped read
9103920	9112480	through them here's home school just can't relate uh explains a lot okay right a five page essay as
9112480	9118320	if you guys can tell me what to do that's funny that you think you can do that it's very cute um
9119440	9125440	but I liked I like don't get me wrong I liked English class when I could write any sort of
9125440	9129840	fiction that's why I really love my creative writing class um
9134400	9138960	I'm I just thought I was I'm debating whether or not to try to find my old email or I save stuff
9140240	9144720	and do a quick dramatic reading for you of one of my old post-by-post role plays
9148080	9148880	actually I kind of want to
9148880	9150880	uh

9271760	9272800	nope okay cool

9286640	9287040	always
9290400	9298480	yeah math is more absolute uh I preferred English because it was you could be very ambiguous
9298480	9301040	because I'm very much like a dreamer type person
9302560	9303600	let me take the headphones off
9308640	9314560	okay let me see let me see if I just type in creative writing if anything pops up
9317120	9317620	okay
9323280	9324400	oh yep
9327520	9329840	what the fuck is about what is this
9335680	9339760	oh I remember I wrote about like a serial killer really briefly
9347440	9353680	okay I wrote this when I was like 17 you guys want to hear it
9356240	9357200	you guys want to hear it
9366480	9369600	oh my god hi rena she just like hopped on my lap as I was about to start
9373040	9373840	teenage writing
9376720	9383120	I'm gonna read this in a British accent
9387040	9393840	I hadn't meant to do it but now I have to deal with the fact that there is a dead body in
9393840	9400480	the waiting room if anyone comes in I'm screwed completely absolutely ultimately screwed
9401600	9405600	this is terrible I was just going to enjoy myself this week no slip-ups
9406160	9411120	I was going to be normal no senseless killing I had found so much for that
9412880	9416400	my head jerks to the side as I hear shoes scuffle on the tile floors and feet away
9417040	9421440	that's not good I'm running out of time my eyes glance around the cliche waiting room
9421440	9425360	a room dappled with dying house plants and pictures of smiling children they're equally
9425360	9431120	happy parents oh look over there that one's a puppy I cock my head and smile blissfully at
9431120	9436960	the splatter of scarlet that had found its way to the framed picture my smile wavered as a nurse
9436960	9441840	entered the waiting area quicker than I anticipated a clipboard in hand she was still unaware of the
9441840	9449920	fellow lying motionless on the floor in a monotone voice called out Mr. Halliday weekend I'm sorry I
9449920	9456160	have to cut you off there I'll spare you the gory details but she did fall voicelessly to the floor
9456160	9463040	with uh maybe a pen in her neck if she was lucky enough to survive it no doubt the seizure she's
9463040	9466320	having would render the brain damage she wouldn't remember me anytime soon
9469680	9474160	my ring is licking my hand and I'm trying to read what are you doing lady can you sit down
9476720	9483520	um I straightened my suit jacket also read for occasions such as these inside the clipboard
9483600	9488000	was covered in the nurse's blood but I could clearly still see one of my aliases in thick
9488000	9494080	black ink more in Halliday I like the name very much and it frustrated me now that I would have
9494080	9498560	to scrap it and get it yet another one false identities weren't particularly cheap these
9498560	9504240	days either and thinking of this caused a scowl to cross my face speaking of which I should probably
9504240	9510320	take care of my face I like how I switched from British to normal it's fine no doubt it was flecked
9510320	9515280	in my favorite color I walked hastily to the nearby bathroom the smell of sterility somewhat
9515280	9521200	dizzying even for a person like myself one who enjoys cleanliness in order ironically with a
9521200	9525520	quick gesture I opened the door and looked in the mirror and the same hazel oh see we're gonna get into
9525520	9534640	the uh the description part by the same hazel eyes same dark brown hair the same clean shaven face
9535280	9540400	even the blood dotted across it was a comforting familiarity my hand promptly reached for the
9540400	9545440	soap while its companion slumped simultaneously turned on the water and I scrubbed earnestly
9545440	9550400	thinking over my options what could I do with the two bodies bleeding out before someone will
9550400	9554320	check back eventually and I need at least 20 minutes to get my supplies in one hour to clean
9554320	9559360	everything up in another two hours to destroy your heart the bodies my lips form a thin line
9559360	9565520	want to stare into the mirror a little longer and think back I pictured the room more specifically
9565520	9572080	the corners thankfully I didn't remember any cameras I really have to have to have to take time
9572080	9577440	to erase video files and probably kill a security guard I knew DNA wasn't a problem anymore for me
9577440	9583200	I had to get to match it to a face as plain as mine I didn't have any memorable scars on my face
9583200	9589600	only my body but that's another story again I didn't I probably watched like one true crime
9589600	9600400	episode before I broke this um let me get us to the audiobook series um I rubbed my hands vigorously
9600400	9605360	with an absurd amount of paper towels before sorry this is really small font so sorry me to read
9605360	9609680	we're shoving them in a fatally small trash can and letting myself out of the bathroom
9610640	9613760	my head peeked around a few corners and it looks like no one had come through yet
9614400	9618000	I stood in the doorway of the waiting room checking my person for any signs that I had
9618720	9623120	dispatched people and found nothing incriminating besides something I could blame on a nosebleed
9625040	9628400	excuse me but the satisfied nod I opened the door to leave the
9628400	9631360	waiting room completely with a sort of flourish and fed it away
9631840	9642320	you're probably wondering who I am thinking why would someone sorry why would a person commit
9642320	9649680	something so morbid may I plead insanity not that I've ever said that none of us hello nice to
9649680	9655680	meet you my name is Nolan Nolan Aristar you've probably heard of me why the f*** I'm so f***ing
9655760	9656480	pretentious
9662400	9669360	I'm like reading this and I feel like I sound like um Heisenberg from f***ing village
9670240	9673200	oh also called the piercer
9674880	9677360	well I'm cementing the venom from my immortal
9677440	9685760	oh it's funny I wrote this before I was diagnosed with OCD you'll see why
9693120	9697200	pardon me also called the piercer pretty nifty if I do say myself giving my
9697200	9701600	given my middle name is pierce but I don't think the cops who christened me knew that
9702320	9705840	anyways drifting from the original topic you're wondering why I've done this but
9705840	9709680	sincerely sincerely I cannot tell you I tell you I cannot help it
9710240	9718240	you see I like the color red very much blood is clearly red in its purest form and I need
9718240	9725120	no eye crave to look at it touch and feel it this is all thanks to my obsessive compulsive
9725120	9731040	disorder commonly known as the abbreviation OCD this is nothing to do with OCD but it's funny
9731040	9737680	that I wrote this I'd like to stop I really would but red is just really my favorite color
9738480	9745360	it calms me it's beautiful I won't say it's art because that's so typical I strange myself from
9745360	9753040	other killers because honestly the majority of them kill for art corpses aren't majestical masterpieces
9753040	9757920	the human body's disgusting thing when twisted and deformed and truly when it's normal and you
9757920	9762960	rot on the inside from corruption or some other adjective that's more poetic
9765120	9766160	I'm not the OCD
9768480	9773360	I'll cringe from time to time at my handiwork I'll get carried away lose myself and be very
9773360	9778160	mad afterwards people need to understand how inconvenient killing a person is it's a time
9778160	9785120	consuming and it's time I can't read my own fucking email and obviously you would get into
9785120	9791280	a lot of trouble I have to take time out of my day to come and end your life which probably isn't
9791280	9797040	all rainbows and sunshine and such a place is this you're welcome you selfish prick heart sign
9797040	9802800	smiley face enough of me and my terrible explaining skills I just felt in the need to justify myself
9802800	9809760	all right all right I literally wrote heart sign smiley face by the way
9809760	9817680	I tossed my suit there's like like two more paragraphs I tossed my suit jacket
9817680	9822800	on the couch when I entered my modest and modern apartment I'm pretty sure this inspired by like
9822800	9828800	um it was inspired by like some true crime thing that I watched it was inspired by
9828800	9834960	Marceline from Adventure Time because how she drinks the color red and I think it was
9835280	9838480	inspired by like American Psycho
9841520	9849920	like all those uh I also was just very aggressive person when I was younger um
9852000	9856560	everything was just as I liked it monochrome with splashes of red I like how my that's kind
9856560	9862960	of how my outfit is um it's monochrome with splashes of red bro I was I predicting my own
9862960	9867600	am I gonna kill no I'm kidding um the only colors I can tolerate besides red are the
9867600	9872720	usual black and white colors that I am indifferent to only apples lay in the bowl on the island in
9872720	9877440	the kitchen only tomatoes were in a jar on the counter besides the sink not that everything I
9877440	9883200	eat is red that would be probably unhealthy and ridiculous I do have my limitations however you'll
9883200	9890800	find nothing orange ever anywhere in here never orange is an unsightly color that should just
9891520	9898560	go home it tries too hard to be red I don't know how some people enjoy orange juice too really
9901600	9908960	orange is an unsightly thing I know uh yeah I actually I do hate the color orange
9913120	9914800	orange is my least favorite color
9915760	9921360	so I threw some shots at orange right now but I do love orange juice so that's a lie
9923920	9928880	uh I do a little jig as I head toward the bathroom peeling off clothes as I near it
9928880	9932880	when I reach the shower I'm already completely undressed feverishly rubbing away the sense of
9932880	9937680	metal with some cinnamon soap cinnamon masks anything I'll tell you that right now I turn
9937680	9942480	my head slightly as I hear a thump somewhere from within the house confused I shut off the water
9942480	9947040	and toweled myself off before stepping out of the shower I'm not an idiot and I don't call out
9947040	9951600	who's there like a stereotypical girl in a horror movie but wrap the towel around my waist
9952400	9956800	wait already like oh no I didn't I just toweled myself well he toweled himself off
9958400	9962880	uh and wait for the sound to occur again and soon enough a moment later it does
9962880	9966320	I sigh with relief as it's not coming from within my apartment but outside the door
9966960	9970000	someone's knocking feel there she's this one
9971600	9975120	the memsie is this story so Dracula's kill who's that
9977360	9983200	Amy hate what do you mean Amy hate confirm is she like orange she's a ginger I don't
9983200	9988000	know this only applies to like the color like if it's on like it doesn't apply to ginger hair
9988640	9992240	because on Emmys I've already said Emmys model is my favorite out of everyone's
9992720	9997600	and then it goes like mercy me
10000640	10004800	actually no that's hard it'd be hard to rank all the girls models
10007040	10010480	and me mercy me
10012480	10017920	fuck because I genuinely like I like mercies and strongies even evenly um hold on
10017920	10027920	I didn't put the connection together
10033200	10037840	I meander down the Honeiro hallway somewhat lazily and finally peer through the people
10037840	10045120	just my like my luck my like on the other side it's not like I have I wrote this in great grammar
10045120	10050240	I just can't read right now on the other side is an eye trying to look through causing me to
10050240	10056720	flinch back when I look again very cautiously I see the smug look of a grizzly grizzly looking cop
10056720	10061040	he's leaning forward to knock again before I can swiftly unlock and open the door
10062240	10066720	before he can I swiftly unlock and open the door letting the cop swing at an open air then
10066720	10073280	smack me in the chest just what I wanted I let out a small squeal hey I just opened the door
10073360	10080480	might you hit me the cop was clearly flustered after this hitting a groan very fit I might add
10080480	10086960	man in a towel and took a step back oh or accident sir sorry about that this won't take long I'm
10086960	10092160	just here to ask a few questions he looked down at his shoes and pulled out a notepad and flipped
10092160	10097440	a few pages I knew it wouldn't take much to make this guy go away but still this had to be the fastest
10097440	10101920	time they spread word about clint killings it's been at least an hour and they've already brought
10101920	10109040	their search radius to my house wincing at this I leaned against the doorway trying trying
10112640	10120000	oh trying to look as huffy yet sexy as possible fire away pardon the pun I smiled widely pretending
10120000	10126320	to be happy the man was there my eagerness was an easy repellent uh well are you aware that they
10126320	10136800	have been dual killings in the area and that's it that's how it ends I remember my classmates
10136800	10142960	were like what for what happens next didn't his he just ultra instinct the door open fast enough
10142960	10147680	to get knocked in the chest well I guess if you like linger and you're like lingering your hand
10147680	10154720	they just opens it and just fucking knocks them yeah the cliffhanger let me see let me see creative
10154720	10158720	writing did you do
10159440	10171760	am I have to go like all the way back
10171840	10174800	so
10181920	10184800	the fuck was I writing Jesus Christ
10197040	10198800	what the fuck is this
10202240	10210800	oh this is some of my OCs
10218720	10227360	interesting sorry this is like I don't remember writing this I'm not reading that no
10227600	10230880	I don't want you guys to figure out how crazy I am
10235680	10241920	is that like again when I said when I joked and said that no it's not it's not one of those
10241920	10243760	it's wait is it one of those I didn't really
10248640	10249200	it was like
10250160	10256320	again as an only child I didn't have any fucking friends okay
10261040	10264960	what if you compared my creative writing to my immortal well look at
10264960	10269760	what I just read to you and then what I've read in my immortal it is not the same
10271040	10276640	peer pressure or so the wolf roleplay tweet I was trying to find the wolf roleplay one
10276640	10280160	because I remember I did like a dramatic writing of my character's death
10280160	10284960	and I love roleplay I don't know where that is though it's not showing up
10289520	10291760	I love how I left notes in the
10291760	10308080	like I like a couple years ago more than a couple years ago like like two decades ago
10308080	10316000	back when I was like 30 um I wrote like notes of like I must have reread it after like a year
10316000	10318640	and then a year after that and I was just like what the fuck is wrong with me
10324000	10326800	yeah my morals my my my magnum opus
10331440	10336320	my morals are really scary I mean a lot of it showed up for the kj somewhere
10336320	10340160	yesterday I think we're somewhere but no like like I was very
10340720	10346080	like it isn't bad like it honestly it's a normal totally normal
10347360	10352560	like I wrote like a chapter of something but it's the context behind it which makes me embarrassed
10353680	10360720	because I wrote like I have this I've told you guys I lose to dream a lot right in fact I lose to
10360720	10366000	dreams um when I woke up from my nap I was losing dreaming it was really weird um
10366160	10376240	dreams have always been really weird for me because for me when I lose to dream I usually
10376240	10386080	visualize a place and then there's like a hub after I lose to dream and it's I always end
10386080	10391520	up there there's always like a hub and then I can like I sound so it sounds fucking crazy
10391520	10399280	saying it out loud because it is it's just weird weird mind shit um but then I can go to like there's
10399280	10409920	always like there's always places in my dreams that are like always constant is how I can
10411600	10417520	say it like I don't like there's always like there's um there's I usually just call it like the hub
10417520	10421520	which is like all the places you can go to and it's like usually there's like a pool
10422960	10426880	you go into and I call it the gate and then there's this place called the train tracks because
10426880	10430000	there's this train tracks and then there was the mall and it was like there's a banded mall
10430000	10434320	whoop I just smacked my microphone and then there was like weirdly like my grandparents house
10435280	10439120	my other grandparents house my mom's there and there's like a bunch of other places and there
10439120	10445760	were there were always constant in my dreams um so I would go from place to place and I would
10445760	10452080	find other places to add to like the hub very weird I don't know why my dreams do that like this
10452080	10459040	the dream that I woke up from today um because I hadn't lucid dreamed in a very long time uh
10461040	10468640	it was like I remember being outside my body and just or I'm usually I'm usually I've already said
10468640	10472720	this before in dreams too I'm usually not myself in my dreams I usually have like a bird's eye
10472720	10476640	perspective it's usually like I'm watching a movie or like watching something take place
10477520	10481760	but this time I was myself and I was outside my body seeing myself talk to like a group of people
10481760	10486880	and I was talking to them and I'm like hey I'm sorry I haven't been back in a long time I haven't
10486880	10494320	woken up in a while and I was just and then I woke up and I was like what the fuck it was just
10494320	10505280	fucking weird no not that hub you fuckers um yeah it's just my dreams are very vivid and weird um
10506400	10510560	I made it that they start yet bro we ended like two hours ago I'm so sorry my the stream was at
10512080	10519120	the stream was at six eastern time so we've heard you're three hours late I'm just talking about
10519200	10525200	stuff now um I'm crying don't cry I wish I could lose the dream
10526160	10530080	why do you have to ask your trips to blend to your sandy yeah so the context of this
10530960	10535760	chapter that I'd written it was like a spin-off of like my dream lucid dream world because I've
10535760	10540240	had this since I was like a little kid like a very little kid it's always been there's also this
10540240	10544720	place called like the factory there's another play like it's really weird why my I don't know why
10544720	10552240	my mind does that I'm like I don't have any fucking trauma that my mind would do that um maybe I'm
10552240	10557760	just like the Lulu when I'm sleeping I don't know she'd be inception but literally though
10557760	10561360	like I like that movie a lot because it's very it's very similar
10565200	10569040	my dreams are absolutely mental and extremely specific and detailed at times yes like I have
10569040	10572960	I literally have a I have a journal next to me where I used to write down my dreams pretty often
10573760	10576000	because again a lot of my dreams I feel like would make really good books
10578960	10586880	um because like I never elaborated on the crocodile dream that I had the other day I just
10586880	10593680	said you saved me from a crocodile there was so much more than that uh we were like you know
10593680	10599360	like old like trope and like writing that was like like maximum ride like the gifted on the run
10599360	10604720	like we were like that it was like me and harem on the run because we all had superpowers and like
10604720	10608640	there was one person that was chasing us that I think he turned into a crocodile and then we
10608640	10617280	killed him and ate him I have I have batched fucking dreams um I remember talking to my one of
10617280	10620720	my therapists one time and I'm like is there something wrong with me and she's like well you
10620720	10626560	know your dreams are just you know your mind working out stuff when when you're asleep from
10626640	10632640	what happened during the day and I'm like I don't think my mind does that because I never
10632640	10640800	dream about the real world I like yeah how are we actually cool yeah you guys were cool
10642240	10648800	I felt like I was in like a reverse harem atome game there's like a bunch of hot harem members
10648800	10652320	around me and we're all like on the run with our superpowers I can't remember it's been too long
10652320	10655120	for me to remember what the superpowers were but I think a lot of them are elemental
10657440	10662080	I explain why I drew a vtuber right are we cool no you're not
10665120	10667520	it's none of you cool you're only cool in my dreams I suppose
10668720	10670640	I might have not been me if it was a hot member
10674240	10678160	you have the drip no we were we were all like wearing the same outfit we were all in like
10678160	10685760	jumpsuits like it was fucking like um uh I almost said bakugan what the fuck is it anime
10686720	10690160	uh my hero academia
10693120	10696400	it's a good game it almost kind of likes your game too um
10697440	10701360	yeah and I remember we were like and then at one point we had to escape a jail
10703280	10706560	um but it was really cool to like watch it because we were all like like my dreams are also
10707360	10711680	the favorite character has arrived free and I go eat
10713520	10714560	my cat's food is going off
10718480	10721920	and then the other one will go off in like four minutes um
10723680	10732880	but um yeah my it's like I'll never have like my cats and my dreams or my parents and my dreams
10732880	10736080	it's very it's never I usually never dream about myself
10737520	10744720	very odd hi Toma it's dinner time for the harem go get your food here to your dispensers going off
10745440	10751040	it's Spencer my favorite streamer I know Strani and um I think somebody else that I was streaming with
10751680	10758080	oh yeah I think it was like Poseidon and Apollo they were just like wow I love the addition of the
10758080	10765360	cat food this thing I was like a really good character I was on the umibus I can't remember
10768640	10775440	oh everybody's been very happy with your muppetizing um of Azura by the way
10778640	10781920	you know how all faces and dreams are ones you see walking around day to day life
10782720	10786720	I've heard that I have very yeah I see like and you know how like you're not supposed to be able to
10786720	10792000	read in dreams I can read in dreams I don't I can read stuff it doesn't like get jumbled
10793360	10795680	I can control stuff it's weird because like
10797520	10803280	there's like there's a consistent pattern of like me being a god of like this fucking like a just a
10803280	10811760	really toxic goddess of my dream realm so when people don't like react a certain way I like smite them
10812240	10822400	you're a muppet fan art for me what is there a muppet was cute it's like big bird big bird here
10825040	10829040	yeah I feel like yeah I was yeah I was really old testament

10833920	10837760	he doesn't want it what do you mean she doesn't want it did she say she just want to be muppetized
10838000	10842320	this is not like a dream to me yeah I was very
10844480	10851200	I'm a very harsh god forced to reckon with in greek inter-egyptian mythology and it's it's
10851200	10856800	interesting too because it's like again my dreams don't end they usually continue or
10856800	10862240	consistent or it's like I'm the god looking at like another portion of my world or I'm like oh this
10862400	10867120	weird shit's happening over here like I remember having like a
10869120	10876880	a like horror related dream of like these people had like mutated this like monster thing and it
10876880	10882320	escaped and it was literally like alien and I was just watching it take place but I wasn't scared

11431760	11432760	Okay.
11432760	11434760	Let's start that.
11434760	11439760	I don't know why hard tune is automatically making me high pitch.
11439760	11440760	Oh my god.
11440760	11444760	I wish you guys could hear the background music.
11444760	11445760	Honey, she is cute.
11445760	11449760	But you guys know I can do a cute and funny voice without the need of that.
11449760	11451760	That's not a squeaky twig.
11451760	11453760	I need a hero.
11453760	11456760	I need a hero till the end of the night.
11456760	11458760	Raina, stop chewing on my headphones.
11458760	11460760	Stop it.
11460760	11462760	And she's got to be strong.
11462760	11464760	And she's got to be...
11464760	11466760	It's cheering on my headphones.
11466760	11467760	Raina, please.
11467760	11468760	I'm begging you.
11468760	11469760	Stop.
11469760	11470760	Stop.
11470760	11472760	Why are you purring?
11472760	11473760	Let's go.
11473760	11476760	She's just me out.
11476760	11479760	She's like, hey.
11479760	11482760	Okay, this pitch sounds more normal.
11482760	11486760	Yeah, because this one I'm just voice acting.
11486760	11487760	Wow.
11487760	11494760	I need a hero.
11494760	11496760	Are you continuing to sing into the thick of it?
11496760	11497760	Oh yeah, earlier.
11497760	11499760	Into the thick of it.
11499760	11501760	Into the thick of it.
11501760	11504760	Into the thick of it.
11504760	11505760	Me.
11505760	11508760	I'm marching through the woods.
11508760	11512760	On and on we push.
11512760	11518760	And we don't know where we're going.
11518760	11519760	Into the thick of it.
11519760	11524760	Oh, isn't that like a crap version of something?
11524760	11525760	Great.
11525760	11530760	I'm just going to start singing for the rest of the stream again because this is fun.
11530760	11532760	No instrumentals.
11532760	11536760	I'll probably do a karaoke stream when I come back though.
11536760	11540760	I'm definitely going to do that.
11540760	11551760	Only bangers today.
11551760	11555760	I will sing you an actual song.
11555760	11557760	I can't believe you called me Chibi.
11557760	11560760	I'm really hurt.
11560760	11567760	In the arms of an angel.
11567760	11577760	In the arms of an angel.
11577760	11579760	This was Chibi Chibi Boys.
11579760	11581760	Ooh.
11581760	11586760	People forgot that I was cute and funny before.
11587760	11590760	Me out here waiting for that BBL Chibi cover.
11590760	11593760	What would it be that?
11593760	11595760	My anaconda don't.
11595760	11597760	My anaconda don't.
11597760	11601760	My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun.
11601760	11605760	Boy toy named Troy used to live in Detroit.
11605760	11608760	I don't know the rest of the song.
11608760	11611760	Addiction to love Florence and the Machine.
11611760	11612760	That's hard.
11612760	11616760	I don't know if Florence and the Machine are kidding me.
11616760	11619760	The perfect song to talk to you.
11619760	11622760	I think I've done the whole, like,
11622760	11629760	sort of mix a lot rap before.
11629760	11633760	I thought you were going to go into doodle-bob with them.
11633760	11635760	Oh, I'm annoyed.
11635760	11637760	I'm annoyed.
11637760	11640760	You're booming.
11640760	11642760	What's that?
11642760	11644760	What's that one song?
11644760	11646760	Don't cry.
11646760	11648760	Oh, wait, wait, wait.
11648760	11650760	And now I want to sing you a song.
11650760	11652760	And I'm going to sing you My Immortal.
11652760	11666760	I'm so tired of being here.
11666760	11673760	I'm depressed by all my childish fears.
11673760	11679760	And if you have to leave, I wish that you'd just leave.
11679760	11681760	I can't sing, by the way.
11681760	11684760	Because your presence still lingers here.
11684760	11688760	And it won't leave me alone.
11688760	11691760	These wounds won't seem to heal.
11691760	11696760	This plane is just too real.
11696760	11702760	There's just too much that time cannot be erased.
11702760	11709760	When you cry, I wipe away all of your tears.
11709760	11716760	When you scream, I bite away all of your fears.
11716760	11722760	And I held your hand through all these years.
11722760	11734760	Where you still have all of me.
11734760	11740760	That time could not erase.
11740760	11742760	For Cease to sing beautifully?
11742760	11744760	No, I don't think so.
11744760	11748760	I wanted to get, like, actual singing lessons.
11748760	11750760	My hand is a G.
11750760	11754760	That's another...
11754760	11765760	I'm going to do just Evanescence songs now.
11765760	11767760	Is Bring Me to Life by Evanescence Emo?
11767760	11773760	People also ask.
11773760	11777760	Well, sometimes I can hear it, like, peek with my breath.
11777760	11781760	Because it's trying to, like, filter them out.
11781760	11783760	How can...
11783760	11785760	Well, hold on.
11785760	11788760	Take a drink of water.
11788760	11791760	Wake me up! Wake me up inside!
11791760	11793760	Can't wake up! Can't wake up!
11793760	11799760	Save me! Save me from the nothing in the door!
11799760	11802760	I love that cover, by the way.
11802760	11804760	Um...
11804760	11822760	How can you see into my eyes, like open doors?
11822760	11830760	Leading you down into my core.
11830760	11834760	Where I've become so numb.
11834760	11837760	If I was, like, classically trained,
11837760	11841760	I know I could be a really good singer, but I'm not.
11841760	11843760	I also have the tendency...
11843760	11845760	I usually sing, like, the person who is singing
11845760	11847760	because of my ekolaleat.
11847760	11849760	So, like, yeah.
11849760	11853760	Wake me up! Wake me up inside!
11853760	11854760	Yeah, I can't...
11854760	11856760	I'm also not good with music in general.
11856760	11859760	Like, I don't have perfect pitch or anything, so...
11859760	11861760	This song hits so hard.
11861760	11863760	When my dad is sad, he blasts Evanescence.
11863760	11865760	Don't tell him I told you that.
11869760	11873760	Just imagine coach in his car, he's blasting Evanescence.
11877760	11879760	You're already a good singer?
11879760	11882760	No, no, I need to, I need to, like, practice and train.
11882760	11884760	But thank you, Amy.
11884760	11886760	He's valid for that.
11889760	11892760	It's the reverb, the reverb's helping me if I take it off.
11900760	11901760	Am I arms?
11901760	11903760	Forget it.
11905760	11907760	Falsetto, you stick to rapping.
11907760	11910760	It's like, I don't even know what my range is.
11912760	11914760	It's like, I can sing pretty deeply
11914760	11917760	because I'm more comfortable singing a lower note
11920760	11926760	Like, I can sing, like, male song songs a little bit easier
11926760	11928760	because I naturally have a deeper voice.
11928760	11930760	But because I have a...
11930760	11932760	Why? The voice strings, I can go really high.
11932760	11935760	Or really low. I can, like, kind of adapt when needed.
11936760	11938760	But yeah, I've been practicing a lot.
11939760	11945760	So they really want to make sure that I do Stacey's mom some justice.
11946760	11949760	My head voice is deeper than most people's chest voice.
11949760	11950760	It makes it hard to sing.
11950760	11951760	Oh, okay.
11951760	11953760	Yeah, I know that does have a factor.
11955760	11958760	Stacey, can I come over?
11958760	11961760	After school, oh, oh, oh
11962760	11964760	After, wait.
11964760	11966760	After school
11966760	11968760	We can hang around
11968760	11970760	by the pu-pu-pu-poo
11970760	11972760	Oh, oh, oh, oh
11972760	11974760	Hang by the pool
11975760	11977760	Did your mom get back
11977760	11979760	from her business trip?
11980760	11982760	Business trip
11983760	11984760	Is she there?
11984760	11987760	Or is she trying to give me the slip?
11989760	11991760	Give me the slip
11991760	11993760	You know I'm not the little girl
11993760	11995760	that I used to be
11995760	11997760	And since your dad walked out
11997760	11999760	your mom could use a girl like me
12001760	12003760	Stacey's mom
12003760	12004760	because I can't go that high
12004760	12005760	I can't belt
12006760	12009760	Stacey's mom has got it
12009760	12011760	That's why in my doing your mom cover
12011760	12013760	it sounds like I'm like quiet
12014760	12016760	Has got it going on
12017760	12019760	She's all that I wanted
12019760	12021760	I've waited for so long
12021760	12023760	Stacey, can't you see
12023760	12025760	you're just not the girl for me
12025760	12027760	I know it might be wrong
12027760	12030760	but I'm in love with Stacey's mom
12031760	12035760	na na na na na na na na na na
12035760	12038760	na na na na na na
12041760	12044760	I love video kill the radio star
12046760	12048760	ooh-wuh-ooh-wuh
12048760	12050760	boom-boom-boom-boom-boom
12050760	12052760	ooh-wuh-ooh-wuh
12052760	12055760	boom-boom-boom-boom-boom-boom
12057760	12059760	ah-tah-muh ah-ah
12059760	12067460	Biddy, I'll kill the radio star. Biddy, I'll kill the radio star.
12067460	12075060	In my mind and in my heart, something, something you've gone too far.
12075060	12077560	Oh, uh, uh, uh, oh.
12078560	12081560	Going for soup. Oh, yeah.
12081560	12091060	I already made a joke of when I think, when I was first playing with the Go XLR, someone said 1985 and I was doing, what did I say?
12091060	12095560	She be just hit the wall, she never had it all.
12095560	12099560	One prozac a day, harem's kinda gay.
12099560	12103560	Her dreams went out the door when she turned 54.
12103560	12107560	Only then would no man, what happened to her plan?
12107560	12111560	She was gonna be an actress, she was gonna be a star.
12111560	12120560	She was gonna shake her ass on the hood of Yaku's car and her yellow SUV is now the enemy.
12120560	12143560	All right, since Cinder, Nukstaku, waiting on Face Connect, there was Pixelink and Bishoujo, music still on YouTube music.
12150560	12156560	I want to do parodies. I already have one parody in mind, but I'm not gonna tell you what it is.
12156560	12159560	Because I have to, it's gonna take a lot to do it.
12159560	12165560	Because I want to make a whole animated music video for it.
12165560	12170560	I got your picture coming with you, dear Maria, count me in.
12170560	12175560	There's a story at the bottom of this bottle and I'm the pen.
12179560	12181560	I had you in the first one.
12182560	12194560	Just eat it.
12194560	12199560	You guys can see I'm also moving a lot.
12199560	12206560	I need a 3D model so bad because you guys can't see how much I'm gesturing and dancing while I'm doing this.
12212560	12219560	Honestly, like, stuck in the drive-thru is one of my favorite, like, jokie songs.
12219560	12224560	Just eat it.
12224560	12227560	How often do you get the mic?
12227560	12229560	Sorry, we can tell.
12229560	12231560	I know, I'm like, I'm swinging my hand.
12231560	12238560	I'm like, I'm smacking my, what's the thing that suspends it?
12238560	12243560	Oh, I need to fix the wires on it, though.
12243560	12245560	There we go.
12245560	12250560	Sometimes the wires slip.
12250560	12255560	I don't remember whether to start something.
12255560	12257560	I need a burp.
12257560	12262560	No burps for you.
12262560	12267560	They get muted.
12268560	12271560	Check, yes, Juliet, are you with me?
12271560	12274560	Rain is pouring down on the sidewalk.
12274560	12276560	Sorry.
12276560	12279560	Denied.
12279560	12281560	Mambo number five.
12281560	12283560	A little bit of straw knee in my life.
12283560	12287560	A little bit, a little bit of mercy.
12287560	12295560	It works because a lot of our names end in E, so that actually would work.
12295560	12298560	A little bit of Zura in the sun.
12298560	12301560	A little bit of Emmy all night long.
12301560	12308560	A little bit of shivvy makes me your man, your woman, your woman, your Dom.
12308560	12316560	Yeah, but then he does say Jessica, so you can say Azura because it's the same syllables.
12316560	12321560	A little bit of icy going on.
12321560	12323560	The snowberries are like, don't forget icy.
12323560	12326560	Don't worry, I didn't forget icy.
12326560	12328560	What's that one rap?
12328560	12338560	Every time I see Icy's name, I think of that one rap by Saweetie.
12338560	12342560	No, I don't want the Wikipedia page.
12342560	12344560	Can't stop. Won't stop.
12344560	12345560	Gikwap.
12345560	12346560	Ten white toes in them.
12346560	12347560	Tori.
12347560	12348560	Flip flops.
12348560	12349560	Many cures of pedicures.
12349560	12350560	I'm always tip top.
12350560	12351560	I'm not hot.
12351560	12353560	All these lies need to stop because I'm icy.
12353560	12354560	Wifey.
12354560	12355560	Haters want to fight me.
12355560	12357560	Never been the one to get a wrap up on a white tee.
12357560	12358560	Keep my hands clean.
12358560	12359560	Got some hitters moving shiesty.
12359560	12362560	Asking if I'm rolling with some Gucci bitch I might be.
12362560	12363560	It's very unlikely.
12363560	12365560	My wrist looking icy.
12365560	12372560	Charge it by the minute because my time is very pricey.
12372560	12375560	Ain't no rest for the wicked.
12375560	12379560	Money don't grow on trees.
12379560	12381560	I like to, I am very good.
12381560	12385560	I think I'm good at rapping.
12385560	12387560	I used to do karaoke a little.
12387560	12392560	I think I did like a whole like Childish Gambino karaoke and Tyler, Tyler the creator karaoke
12392560	12394560	because they're my favorite rappers.
12394560	12397560	I think I did, I think I did like a Kendrick one.
12397560	12401560	But I was rapping bonfire and everybody was like losing their minds.
12401560	12405560	It was so funny.
12405560	12407560	You're very good.
12407560	12408560	Thanks.
12408560	12409560	All right.
12409560	12410560	It's Childish Gambino.
12410560	12415560	Homegirls drop it like the NASDAQ move white girls like there's coke up my ass crack.
12415560	12420560	I just fucking love Childish Gambino's lyricism.
12420560	12422560	Junior mom is an exemplary pretty good.
12422560	12423560	Thank you.
12423560	12424560	Appreciate it.
12424560	12434560	Honestly, I will sing praises of mercy, however, because she did her whole song in one take
12434560	12436560	because she thought she had to.
12436560	12438560	She never recorded things before.
12438560	12439560	Never recorded music.
12439560	12442560	Neither have I, but I didn't think that she's just like one shot.
12442560	12444560	She did that all in one fucking take.
12444560	12447560	Can you believe that?
12447560	12452560	My, my, my gen mates are so talented.
12452560	12454560	Yeah, I love Mercy's cover.
12454560	12456560	Like she's like, I don't like it.
12456560	12459560	I'm like, this is freaking flames.
12459560	12461560	Why don't you call 45 karaoke bar?
12461560	12463560	Well, I think what was the last?
12463560	12472560	When I first started at my job, my last job, which was almost six years ago for like a
12472560	12476560	team building thing that took the new hires out to karaoke.
12476560	12480560	And that was the first time I hung out with Olive and we sing.
12480560	12482560	What are we saying together?
12482560	12484560	We sang the Spice Girls.
12484560	12490560	If you want to be my lover, that was really cute.
12490560	12492560	I'll tell you what I want.
12492560	12493560	I want to really, really want.
12493560	12494560	So tell me what you want.
12494560	12495560	What you really, really want.
12495560	12499560	I want to, I want to, I want to, I want to, I want to really, really, really sing.
12499560	12504560	If you want to be my lover, you got to get with my friends.
12504560	12506560	They can last forever.
12506560	12508560	Friendship never ends.
12508560	12510560	If you want to be my lover.
12510560	12513560	You guys can't see, but I'm really rocking.
12513560	12515560	Yeah, it was really great.
12515560	12519560	That literally was the beginning of our friendship to sing that together with her.
12520560	12522560	Can't wait for me to be on their covers.
12522560	12523560	Yes, I'm working on one.
12523560	12525560	Do I need to work on one?
12525560	12527560	Maybe I'll do that.
12527560	12531560	When I come back, I don't want to over, overdo myself because I'm already going to work on
12531560	12535560	probably a gameplay video and then an ASMR video.
12535560	12537560	I don't really rock the Spice Girls.
12537560	12538560	I'll dance however I want.
12538560	12543560	I'm just waving my arms around and then I just end up really rocking.
12543560	12544560	Ooh, a cover.
12544560	12545560	Yeah.
12545560	12548560	I want to, my next cover is going to be Stacey's mom.
12548560	12550560	100%.
12550560	12554560	Slay queen.
12554560	12558560	And then Shawnee says I have to cover five bars, five seconds.
12558560	12560560	So I will do that next.
12560560	12562560	Because that'll be a funny short, actually.
12562560	12567560	Actually, I think since I already technically did that in my Elden Drink stream or my Haiti stream,
12567560	12569560	I can't remember which one it was.
12569560	12571560	That should be clipped.
12571560	12573560	Wait, I think someone did clip it.
12573560	12577560	And I'm just going to package it down even more and then make it into a short in the scent
12577560	12579560	of Shawnee because it'll make her day.
12579560	12581560	Play all those arms queen.
12581560	12582560	It's funny.
12582560	12586560	I'm still learning how to pilot my model properly because I move my arms a lot,
12586560	12587560	but I don't move my body.
12587560	12590560	But I'm like, no, you got to move around.
12590560	12591560	You got to bounce with it.
12591560	12592560	You wouldn't rock with it.
12592560	12594560	You wouldn't rock with it.
12594560	12596560	Oh, I forgot to put my cover up on.
12596560	12598560	Oh, frick.
12598560	12600560	Shit.
12600560	12612560	No.
12612560	12615560	Sorry.
12615560	12623560	No.
12623560	12624560	What do you mean?
12624560	12629560	No, I knew the entire time I had reverb and echo still on.
12629560	12632560	I can't hear it in my headphones.
12632560	12657560	That's all in song.
12658560	12659560	It's great though.
12659560	12661560	You know, it's a classic echo.
12661560	12663560	Echo, echo, echo.
12663560	12665560	I love a song too.
12665560	12666560	I love that song.
12666560	12669560	Thanks for hearing from Kingdom Hearts.
12669560	12673560	Oh, it's great.
12673560	12678560	I would just like have that song repeat and also simply and clean.
12679560	12686560	I have like an essence stuck in my head so I can't bring off lyrics.
12686560	12694560	Simple and clean.
12694560	12697560	When you walk away.
12697560	12699560	Wait, no.
12699560	12706560	Take a deep breath for that one.
12706560	12707560	I know.
12707560	12712560	Sanctuary, in my opinion, is the best Kingdom Hearts song.
12712560	12725560	When you walk away, you don't hear me say, please, oh baby, don't go simple and clean.
12725560	12727560	I can hear myself peeking in my headphones.
12727560	12728560	I don't like it.
12728560	12733560	It's the way that you're breaking me feel tonight.
12733560	12738560	It's hard to let it go.
12738560	12741560	Yeah, something like that.
12741560	12754560	Also, I really used to like Tommy Heavenly.
12754560	12767560	Because I love Soul Eater as some of you may know.
12767560	12768560	I'm not.
12768560	12772560	Wait, where's the Romanji?
12772560	12773560	Oh wait, Amelie covered that?
12773560	12775560	I have to listen to that then.
12775560	12780560	Because it popped up when I was typing Romanji.
12780560	12781560	This is not Romanized.
12781560	12790560	This is the same thing as before.
12790560	12794560	My cats have the zoomies.
12794560	12795560	Yes, Black Paper Moon.
12795560	12796560	I'm late.
12796560	12797560	Hi Nori.
12797560	12801560	I'm just singing stuff.
12801560	12805560	I'm fall.
12805560	12806560	I'm fall.
12806560	12807560	I'm fall.
12807560	12812560	I can't hit notes, bro.
12812560	12823560	I'm falling down into my shadow.
12823560	12825560	I can also can't read Japanese.
12825560	12835560	I'm falling down into my shadow.
12835560	12845560	I'm falling down into my shadow.
12845560	12855560	I'm falling down into my shadow.
12855560	12865560	I'm falling down into my shadow.
12865560	12876560	What's my cat doing?
12876560	12881560	Raina, what are you doing?
12881560	12882560	I'm not late.
12882560	12884560	We're so up.
12884560	12885560	I can't read Japanese.
12885560	12887560	I can't read Romanji.
12887560	12888560	Don't cry.
12888560	12889560	Don't cry.
12889560	12890560	Stop singing.
12890560	12891560	Stop crying.
12891560	12902560	I listen to a lot of Tommy Heavenly when I was younger in my weeb era and K-pop.
12902560	12905560	What's that?
12905560	12906560	Lucifer by SHINee.
12906560	12911560	This is my favorite K-pop song.
12911560	12912560	Lyrics.
12912560	12913560	Romanize.
12913560	12918560	I'm going to butcher some Korean.
12918560	12921560	Wait, the ad popped up.
12921560	12922560	I can't read this.
12922560	12924560	Raina, what are you doing?
12924560	12926560	You're like, I can hear you crashing stuff.
12926560	12928560	Just lay down, lady.
12928560	12930560	Rest in peace.
12930560	12933560	By the way.
12934560	12936560	Wait.
12957560	12959560	I also used to know the dance.
12959560	12963560	I used to know a lot of Korean choreography, K-pop choreography.
12963560	12966560	Like rocking from team top.
12966560	12967560	Team top.
12967560	12968560	We don't make team top.
12968560	12969560	Team top.
12969560	12971560	We don't rock it, pop it, stop it.
12981560	12987560	I'm going to show you the choreography for that for a quick second.
12987560	12990560	She beat love by beats for cats to wreck the house too.
12990560	12993560	She knocked over like...
12993560	12995560	All my plants doing fine actually.
12995560	12996560	She didn't knock it over.
12996560	12998560	I think she just bumped it.
12998560	12999560	Heading to bed.
12999560	13000560	Have a good sleep.
13000560	13001560	Sleep.
13001560	13002560	Sleep.
13002560	13003560	Sleep.
13003560	13005560	Sleep and Eep.
13005560	13007560	Um...
13007560	13011560	I just think of Mickey Mouse.
13011560	13012560	I just think of Mickey Mouse.
13012560	13013560	I just think of Mickey Mouse.
13013560	13014560	I just think of Mickey Mouse.
13014560	13015560	I just think of Mickey Mouse.
13015560	13016560	What's up?
13016560	13019560	Oh, something here.
13024560	13026560	What are you doing?
13026560	13030560	She just has her head buried in the crook of my elbow.
13030560	13033560	Eating the Korean produce right now.
13033560	13036560	I'm going to show you real...
13036560	13038560	No, you can look it up.
13038560	13041560	Look up team top rocking.
13041560	13044560	The song used to go so hard.
13044560	13049560	I used to be able to know the choreography team top.
13049560	13054560	And to scroll in like the middle.
13054560	13058560	Fucking ad bro.
13058560	13060560	Yes, you'll see the Mickey.
13060560	13071560	Sleep is slipping out.
13071560	13083560	Such a bop.
13083560	13086560	Yeah, I really like K-pop because of the urban influences in it.
13086560	13093560	And it was like a combination of like Asian culture and urban culture.
13093560	13097560	And I like literally just like start shuffling in this music video and it was so sick.
13097560	13101560	So I had to learn it.
13101560	13106560	And I preferred male choreography because they actually dance.
13106560	13108560	The girls just like walked around all cutely.
13108560	13109560	Actually, no, that's a lie.
13109560	13121560	I did like electric shock from girls generation.
13121560	13131560	It's a girls generation.
13131560	13136560	No, it was by FX.
13136560	13139560	E-E-E-E electric shock.
13139560	13141560	Na na na na na na.
13141560	13143560	Na na na na na na.
13143560	13150560	E-E-E electric shock.
13150560	13155560	That was a nice gauge for girls generation.
13155560	13157560	Listening to new jeans around the home.
13157560	13159560	He's got some questioning or friendship.
13159560	13161560	New jeans is good.
13161560	13164560	I don't really listen to a lot of Korean music anymore, though.
13164560	13170560	I usually just listen to, I've been listening to a lot of Tyler.
13170560	13177560	A lot of K-Tranota.
13177560	13182560	I've been going through my old music and listening to it since I was listening to my self-indulgence the other day.
13182560	13185560	I have a very wide taste of music.
13185560	13190560	Very wide range, wide taste of music.
13190560	13201560	And people talk about things they like will not have any clue what they're talking about as long as they're on my first date.
13201560	13206560	Boomi, what are you doing?
13206560	13208560	Boomi, are you Zoomin?
13208560	13222560	Are you Metro Zoomin? Metro Boomin Zoomin?
13222560	13225560	Why are you running everywhere?
13226560	13232560	I'm just like jumping.
13232560	13240560	Please don't chew on my wires. Thank you. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Woo!
13240560	13245560	Why are you running? Why are you running?
13245560	13247560	I have electric shock stuck in my head.
13247560	13254560	Sorry, I got distracted by reading fanfiction, my own old class stuff, and then singing.
13254560	13257560	I am so sorry.
13257560	13262560	I am so sorry.
13262560	13265560	I just get so distracted in the sidetracks.
13265560	13269560	You never knew cats got Zoomies? Are you kidding me? Cats are Zoomie masters.
13269560	13271560	You thought dogs were its cats, dude.
13271560	13273560	Are you gonna leave?
13273560	13276560	I don't know.
13276560	13278560	Why am I streaming tomorrow? Hold on.
13278560	13283560	I think I'm streaming. Why does my mic sound like it's cutting out?
13283560	13290560	It's like really weird sounding because it's trying to filter my voice for whatever fucking reason.
13290560	13300560	It's really kind of annoying. I wish I would stop doing that.
13300560	13314560	And some of my singing was nice. Keywords, some, some.
13314560	13318560	What does that do? I'm just pressing buttons on my goXLR wondering what the heck's going on.
13318560	13326560	I mean, I'm like, why is the gate so high?
13326560	13334560	That's why it's, I don't know why. Sometimes it like messes up stuff on purpose.
13334560	13342560	That's my cat, Tokyo drifting if you didn't hear.
13342560	13346560	I couldn't tell you which one it was though because they're all just standing and staring at each other like that one.
13347560	13350560	Because it had fun.
13368560	13370560	Can he drive? No, he can't.
13376560	13384560	If you know how they live in Tokyo, if you've seen it and you need it and you know you have to go fast and furious.
13384560	13388560	Drift, drift, drift, fast and furious.
13388560	13392560	Drift, drift, drift.
13392560	13397560	That song goes so hard. I want to watch Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift now.
13397560	13400560	I haven't watched that in a long time.
13406560	13418560	That's pretty clever.
13418560	13420560	That was pretty clever.
13420560	13424560	I listened to that song so much you triggered something in my brain.
13424560	13428560	Fast and Furious is never the same after that.
13428560	13434560	I haven't seen, I think the last movie I saw was like either Fast 5 or Fast 6.
13434560	13439560	I heard that they're on the 11th movie now or it's in production.
13439560	13442560	Thank you by the way, Morgan for the tip.
13448560	13450560	The last one was like 4.
13450560	13456560	Tokyo Drift was like not even a good one though.
13456560	13462560	The text to speech didn't go off because I have my desktop audio muted.
13462560	13464560	So don't worry.
13464560	13470560	Because I didn't, when I was playing music earlier from when I was singing to Emmy, I didn't want to mess it up.
13470560	13474560	And like it claimed or something.
13474560	13480560	I get demonetized either way because of my tickle bitties.
13480560	13484560	Oh, my neighbors don't hate me too much.
13484560	13490560	I'm singing at the same level as my TV when I put it up.
13490560	13494560	It's fine.
13494560	13496560	Tokyo Drift was the third one.
13496560	13500560	Honestly, the first, second, and third were good.
13500560	13504560	Tokyo Drift wasn't good but soundtrack and scene were good.
13504560	13506560	I agree with that.
13506560	13508560	Hardcore.
13508560	13520560	I put my BGM back up so we're not just like listening to weird silence in my AC lightly in the background.
13520560	13526560	Wait, why weren't they allowed to film in Shibuya?
13526560	13532560	I didn't know that.
13532560	13534560	I honestly just wish the main character wasn't that dude.
13534560	13536560	I wish it was Paul Walker.
13536560	13538560	He just like randomly is in Japan for no reason.
13538560	13540560	I feel like that would have been funny.
13540560	13544560	It's like, uh, Brian, we heard about, what was his name?
13544560	13546560	Wasn't it Ryan?
13546560	13548560	We heard about something.
13548560	13550560	Oh, Brian, that's what it was.
13550560	13554560	Brian, we heard about something and we need you to go to Japan because you know about this stuff.
13554560	13558560	Go.
13558560	13560560	Oh, people are, oh, that's terrible actually.
13560560	13562560	It wasn't safe.
13562560	13564560	Oh my God.
13564560	13568560	Damn.
13568560	13576560	Oh, let me, let's look at my schedule because I said I was going to do that.
13576560	13588560	Okay, so, yeah, we have Elden Ring tomorrow and then Elden Ring after that.
13588560	13592560	Because we're getting to the DLC.
13592560	13594560	I've been reading up on the DLC by the way.
13594560	13596560	I don't care about spoilers and shit.
13596560	13600560	I like to go into games like this prepared.
13600560	13608560	And so I was watching like things you should do and like what levels you should be at and all that stuff.
13608560	13612560	So the next two days are playing Elden Ring.
13612560	13614560	And honestly, I don't think we already be redone.
13614560	13624560	I still have to go and kill Godfree, which is going to take fucking forever.
13624560	13630560	Do I have to kill his mirage self or do I have to actually kill him?
13630560	13634560	Because in my game, I didn't even bother fighting him.
13634560	13642560	I just killed his fake version and that was it.
13642560	13646560	I never fought Horaloo.
13646560	13650560	Yeah, I need to get Moog.
13650560	13652560	Okay, okay, the mirage.
13652560	13654560	Okay, cool, cool, cool.
13654560	13656560	That's fine then.
13656560	13658560	I have to kill Moog.
13658560	13662560	And for that, I was looking up what Moog's week two and it's literally blood poison.
13662560	13666560	Like anything that like procs after a long time like scarlet rot.
13666560	13670560	I'm like, but the thing is he's like,
13670560	13676560	he has resistance like 40% to like fire or like 80% to like fucking fire or something.
13676560	13682560	And then like 40% to all the others or 20% to all the others to all the other elements.
13682560	13688560	I think he's like 20 or 40 or 30% resistant to magic.
13688560	13692560	So I'm wondering if I need to get another fucking weapon.
13692560	13696560	Probably worth killing the last two sacred tears.
13696560	13700560	That's a good point.
13700560	13704560	I killed, I remember in my first playthrough, I killed Morgoth on the first try and I was really
13704560	13708560	or like the, at least like the third try and I was like, what?
13708560	13714560	That's because I was just spamming the black knife the entire time to get that like death blight.
13714560	13722560	Yeah, I'm just wondering if it's going to be smart going into the Moog fight with the moon veil.
13722560	13724560	I don't think so.
13725560	13727560	Um.
13729560	13730560	Oh, yeah.
13730560	13732560	Okay.
13732560	13734560	Yeah.
13734560	13742560	And then we have on Saturday, which I'm really, really looking forward to is the rating VTubers designs.
13742560	13743560	I can't wait.
13743560	13744560	It's going to be fun.
13744560	13747560	And then we have the May plus concert watch along on Sunday.
13747560	13752560	And then before I leave on Thursday,
13753560	13755560	a little sneak peek of my schedule ahead.
13755560	13761560	We're doing the Twilight watch along on Monday the 15th.
13761560	13770560	And unless I might change that because I have to bring Reina to the doctor that day too at 9am.
13770560	13773560	So if everything's fine, then yes, it will continue.
13773560	13776560	If it's not fine, I will keep you posted.
13776560	13780560	And then I have a collab with Mercy on Tuesday.
13780560	13782560	I convinced her to play Super Bunny Man with me.
13782560	13785560	And I know we're going to have lots of fun and laugh at that.
13785560	13794560	And then Wednesday before I go, I'm going to do an ASMR stream where I'm your big sister and I put makeup on you as torture.
13794560	13802560	And then yeah, and then I'll be gone until I so technically I'm back.
13803560	13808560	The 22nd or 23rd.
13808560	13809560	I can't remember.
13809560	13811560	I have to look at my flight.
13813560	13816560	Can't remember if it's early or late.
13818560	13826560	And then I might take like the 23rd just like off just so I can like get my bearings,
13826560	13831560	but I might do a gorilla that day if I feel good enough.
13832560	13840560	But yeah, I just want to keep you guys posted because you know, I like to keep you guys posted.
13840560	13841560	Yeah, I'm going to doll you up.
13841560	13846560	I'm going to like torture you and be like, I need to practice makeup makeup skills for like prom.
13846560	13848560	So sit down and you guys can't move.
13848560	13852560	And then I'm just going to like be doing a bunch of shit to you.
13852560	13853560	Yeah, you're my baby doll.
13853560	13855560	I'm going to start calling you baby doll.
13855560	13857560	Hey, baby doll.
13857560	13859560	Hello, honey.
13859560	13861560	Hello, my baby doll.
13861560	13863560	I can't wait to play with you and break you.
13879560	13881560	Hey, God, I hear your phones.
13884560	13886560	I mean, this little sister she views big sis.
13886560	13887560	Exactly.
13887560	13888560	Exactly.
13889560	13896560	I am your, um, Oni.
13896560	13897560	Oni?
13897560	13899560	I forget the honor effect pronunciation.
13899560	13902560	You guys know your Bible is acting up.
13902560	13905560	You should probably smack it down.
13907560	13908560	My hot woman.
13908560	13910560	You can't keep doing this to me.
13910560	13911560	I'm going to die.
13912560	13914560	Oni, son.
13914560	13916560	Oni, son.
13917560	13918560	Well darn too.
13918560	13920560	And I'll be your Oni-san.
13920560	13922560	Emo-shi-mo-shi.
13922560	13923560	I just think of that one tick.
13923560	13929560	That girl who speaks like fluent Japanese when she does it all on a southern accent as a joke.
13929560	13932560	Arigata gozaimasu.
13932560	13934560	Itadakimasu.
13934560	13935560	Sue.
13935560	13940560	Shibine-chan.
13945560	13946560	It sounded like Callie.
13946560	13948560	I've gotten that before.
13961560	13964560	If you don't come back speaking...
13964560	13966560	I don't know what that means.
13969560	13971560	Go-mana-sorry.
13971560	13973560	That's one of my favorite like off-handed things.
13976560	13978560	Yeah, I'm pretty accurate when I mimic you guys.
13978560	13980560	Go-mana-sorry.
13980560	13981560	Sorry.
13981560	13982560	Am I Canadian?
13983560	13984560	Sorry.
13984560	13985560	Sorry.
13985560	13986560	Off the bed.
13986560	13989560	Thanks for watching your evening with my comedy and entertainment personality.
13989560	13990560	Thank you.
13990560	13991560	Have a good one.
13991560	13992560	Thanks for stopping by.
13993560	14000560	I always like, I think, I think I genuinely like seeing people from the other girls,
14000560	14004560	um, whatchamacallits, uh, fanbases.
14004560	14007560	And because I'm just like, I'm glad that you can also enjoy me too.
14007560	14009560	Like I might not be your Oshi, but you're like, you're still like,
14009560	14012560	when your Oshi's not on, you can just be like,
14012560	14014560	you know what, I'm gonna hang out with my bro today.
14017560	14019560	Okay, yeah, so that just continues.
14019560	14020560	It never ends.
14020560	14021560	It never ends.
14023560	14024560	Got home from work.
14024560	14025560	She's still straight.
14025560	14026560	You guys know I never stop.
14026560	14029560	Japanese and singing classes for madam.
14031560	14032560	She be my bro-shi.
14032560	14035560	I love bro-shi.
14035560	14037560	That's actually awesome.
14037560	14038560	I'll be your bro-shi.
14045560	14046560	That's funny.
14046560	14048560	I'll be your bro-shi.
14049560	14059560	I like how the thing that I was initially doing,
14059560	14063560	which is reading up my like personal writings when I was a teenager,
14063560	14065560	I just never looked to find the one I want,
14065560	14070560	because I wanted to show you the actual like wolf one that I have written
14070560	14073560	about my Oshi Cassander.
14073560	14076560	He was a beautiful white wolf.
14077560	14082560	And he was killed by his own brother like Mufasa Scar style.
14082560	14084560	Kami bro-shi.
14086560	14088560	I was Cassander with a C.
14090560	14096560	I would often get a lot of my names inspired by Greek mythology,
14096560	14097560	or just Greek.
14099560	14104560	Or even like William Shakespeare characters.
14104560	14106560	Yeah, he got Mufasa.
14108560	14110560	Wait, let me see if I can find it.
14110560	14112560	I wonder if I just look up Cassander.
14135560	14137560	No, that's not it.
14161560	14163560	Nope, nope, nope.
14165560	14167560	And maybe it wasn't, I didn't save it.
14167560	14168560	That's a bummer.
14182560	14184560	I thought it would have been underdraft.
14185560	14186560	No.
14187560	14191560	Arner, clary, not the water.
14192560	14193560	Search the archive.
14205560	14206560	RIP.
14208560	14210560	Writing stream to make up for it?
14210560	14211560	No, I'm not the same.
14211560	14214560	Like actually, I was an okay writer when I was younger.
14214560	14217560	I don't, I haven't written in such a long time.
14217560	14219560	Like actively.
14222560	14228560	Oh man, I must be lost on one of my old computers.
14233560	14235560	Oh my god, Reyna.
14236560	14237560	Relax, lady.
14238560	14241560	You need to, oh my god.
14241560	14244560	She just like threw herself on my desk.
14247560	14249560	My god, woman.
14252560	14255560	Creative writing memory stream.
14259560	14261560	I mean, I'm sorry that she knows you're leaving, I know.
14261560	14265560	I just don't want her to hurt herself because sometimes she just throws herself on my desk
14265560	14270560	and then she trips over my go XLR and my keyboard and I'm like, no, lady.
14272560	14276560	Yeah, Strani was telling me that you guys liked the script writing stream.
14277560	14283560	I'm a little self-conscious about my writing, which is why I haven't written any of my own scripts yet.
14287560	14294560	Ellie showed you what I wrote when I was much younger because I have the excuse to say I was much younger
14294560	14296560	because it's that cringy.
14300560	14302560	She lives with her cast, not the other way around.
14307560	14308560	What?
14309560	14315560	These rice cakes taste like TV static and I started barfing up 50 colds.
14317560	14321560	I know, yeah, I was wondering if I should write my own script.
14321560	14328560	I just don't like, I'm not, I don't, I write, I don't write scripts.
14330560	14333560	Like I could probably write a story.
14334560	14342560	Like I can write like amazing smut for you if you want of me and Harum or me and insert your name,
14342560	14344560	like a fanfiction of us together.
14344560	14346560	I can do that very easily.
14346560	14349560	But like writing, I've never, did I write it?
14349560	14351560	Did I write a script in theater class?
14351560	14354560	I did like one theater class when I was younger.
14354560	14356560	I can't remember if I wrote a script though.
14356560	14357560	Might have.
14358560	14360560	Haven't all jacked it out for you.
14360560	14361560	Yeah.
14361560	14367560	But it's like, but then I like, again, I've read like we have a script writer and then like
14367560	14375560	Shrani's are in scripts and I've seen in fact, I have to record a script for Emmy for a special
14375560	14377560	little treat that she wants to record together.
14380560	14386560	But and like, I'm like, I think I could, it might not be as good, but it would just be like,
14386560	14387560	at least a starting point.
14387560	14391560	And then you guys could like, obviously like give me a critique and examples.
14391560	14398560	So yeah, maybe when I come back, I want to do, in fact, I want to make my schedule right now for when I come back.
14400560	14402560	Because I want to do Hades.
14404560	14406560	Let's do Wednesday.
14406560	14408560	We'll do because I usually do member Mondays.
14408560	14409560	So we'll do Wednesday.
14409560	14411560	I'll do the members stream.
14416560	14427560	I'll do script writing.
14427560	14429560	Remember stream.
14429560	14430560	I want to play.
14430560	14433560	I put the wrong time.
14433560	14434560	Or p.m.
14439560	14443560	I also have to make time to hang out with Tomo.
14446560	14450560	Then I have a collab with DEMPA coming up.
14450560	14452560	I have so much shit to do guys.
14452560	14454560	I'm so busy.
14454560	14456560	And then I still want it when I come back.
14456560	14462560	I want to record my next two months of audios for Patreon.
14462560	14466560	So I'm going to be a busy fucking bee, but I like it though.
14466560	14470560	It keeps me busy because otherwise I just lay around and that's not fun.
14471560	14474560	Let's see.
14474560	14477560	I take Sundays off so I can work on other stuff.
14477560	14479560	So I'm not going to do anything on Sunday.
14482560	14484560	What day did I say with Tomo that I would hang out?
14484560	14486560	Let me look at my camera.
14489560	14496560	I just looked at Discord for the first time in a while and I'm laughing because Imi sent a meme.
14497560	14500560	I said, I must be Sonic the way I'm hedging my hog.
14502560	14504560	I fucking love her so much.
14504560	14507560	Why is she so funny for no reason?
14512560	14515560	Tomo are you still here about looking at the chat?
14515560	14517560	No, I think she disappeared.
14517560	14519560	I don't know if she's streaming or anything.
14526560	14528560	I don't know.
14535560	14539560	Okay, I might have to be the week after that I do want the Tomo because I don't.
14539560	14542560	I don't think we actually sell alone a day.
14547560	14549560	Okay, I'll do Hades on Thursday.
14552560	14554560	Hades.
14556560	14558560	Wait, no, I want to do the member stream.
14558560	14560560	Discard.
14560560	14562560	No, I want to do karaoke really bad for real.
14570560	14572560	Should I do it?
14572560	14574560	I'll ask you guys.
14576560	14583560	If you and only if you're a member answer this question, would you prefer it be an archive?
14583560	14592560	Because like what sucks about an unarchived karaoke member stream is that not all members might be able to see it.
14596560	14599560	So I'm debating if that's a good idea.
14606560	14609560	Because I don't want could always do a rebroadcast.
14614560	14617560	Anyway, Patreon members could see no.
14620560	14623560	There's Patreon content and there's YouTube content.
14623560	14626560	They are two separate entities, but I appreciate if you support me on one.
14626560	14629560	And if you can't support me on the other, that is fine.
14631560	14633560	But also a girl got to eat.
14636560	14638560	I just can't hit.
14638560	14646560	Like there's also there has to be a reason why you want to become a member, you know, and it's for the fun, cool stuff, member stuff.
14647560	14650560	Re-broadcasting, I don't know what that means.
14651560	14653560	Oh, I'm getting cramps and it hurts.
14668560	14690560	You just rebroadcast of the stream, but like stream you stream the unarchived pod.
14692560	14697560	Oh, oh, okay.
14698560	14700560	No, yeah, that's actually a good idea.
14700560	14701560	That's what Narissa does.
14701560	14703560	Okay, then I'm going to copy Narissa.
14704560	14707560	That's smart because then I can just stream and record.
14709560	14712560	I need to get a new SSD because I'm running out of space.
14712560	14719560	I have like maybe 300 gigabytes left and I have like so many fucking because no, you know what I need to fucking do?
14719560	14722560	I need an uninstall overwatch and fucking call of duty.
14723560	14728560	That's what I needed to uninstall and save up like 600 gigabytes from that alone.
14730560	14732560	The 1080, you mean my 1070?
14736560	14741560	I like I'll probably I'll probably get a new PC when I do a donathon.
14741560	14743560	Like I'll probably make the proceeds go to that.
14744560	14748560	Actually, I don't really know because like my PC is fine.
14748560	14750560	It's not like dying.
14750560	14757560	I just have to uninstall stuff because I'm like, I know a portion of donathon proceeds.
14757560	14770560	I'm definitely going to put towards like paying off FIA and Reyna's medical bills and then the rest I'll probably maybe like 3D model because I really want a 3D model really bad.
14770560	14771560	It's funny.
14771560	14778560	I used to like hate 3D models and then I just realized how much I want one to single like people what people do with 3D models.
14780560	14782560	So work expense.
14787560	14788560	Yeah, I don't know.
14791560	14792560	Oh, yeah.
14792560	14793560	A 40 series to be cheaper.
14793560	14794560	That's a good point.
14794560	14796560	If you upgrade the 1070 or 100%, I know.
14796560	14797560	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
14797560	14800560	I think I'm trying to think what my power supply is.
14804560	14805560	What the fuck?
14805560	14807560	Again, I built this like so long ago.
14807560	14810560	I'll have to build a whole new fucking PC and I'm not looking forward to it.
14810560	14811560	I'll be honest with you.
14811560	14817560	I might just buy a pre-build because I just I don't have the patience to try to put a PC together again.
14817560	14819560	I used to love doing it because I did it very often.
14819560	14822560	I would my dad and I used to work for him.
14822560	14827560	He would just give me PCs to build and unbuild and fix and update and stuff.
14831560	14832560	But I just don't feel like doing that.
14836560	14840560	I think I have a 700 watt power supply.
14840560	14845560	I think I have a maybe kind of find that my email.
14849560	14851560	Let me see if I...
14867560	14873560	I think I have a 700 watt gold something power supply.
14873560	14874560	7050 at zero.
14874560	14875560	Okay.
14875560	14878560	So then I probably, yeah, I don't think I don't have a 750.
14878560	14881560	I thought I had a 1000 watt, but I don't.
14898560	14899560	How...
14900560	14901560	What the fuck?
14901560	14907560	I look up PC part picker to see if I like took a screenshot of something and I'm getting all these emails of all this role plays that I did.
14907560	14909560	That doesn't make any sense how these are coming up.
14915560	14916560	What the fuck?
14918560	14919560	Oops.
14937560	14938560	Sorry.
14955560	14957560	Sorry, I mislike distracted reading stuff that I wrote when I was younger.
14957560	14958560	I'm sorry.
14958560	14959560	I just told her like disassociating.
14959560	14962560	Cause I was like, oh, interesting.
14962560	14970720	interesting so it was like some fanfic about the cuz I remember I told you I
14970720	14977080	don't know if you guys recall I um did are you like made OCs for like soul eater
14977080	14982840	so it was like a soul eater fanfic so I was like oh fascinating
14982840	14994760	I can't find shit I'm so pissed right now I can't even think straight cuz
14994760	15000860	these cramps are fucking hurting me so fucking bad it just hit me all of a
15000860	15004280	sudden yeah the solid it's like I know I might just like sit with myself when
15004280	15007920	I'm like when I'm like bored at my grandparents just my iPad and just be
15007920	15013680	like fascinating let's read your shit I remember you said you made the dudes bang
15013680	15020040	each other a lot I definitely did I couldn't find anything of that though
15020040	15024760	although there was like a saved file that's a schmutz stuff but I didn't
15024760	15032760	look at it oh yeah I love soul eater um pre-built is fine make sure the parts oh
15032760	15038400	yeah no like the thing is it's so much better to not buy pre-built because when
15038400	15042600	you build it yourself you can really get the parts at better prices because they
15042600	15046560	usually just overinflate their fucking part like the computer prices so I'm
15046560	15051600	probably gonna end up cuz like I remember management told me how much
15051600	15056280	Azura's computer was I was like there's no way you needed to spend that much
15056280	15060600	money on her computer cuz I could have built her a way better computer for a
15060640	15068640	fraction of the price um but PC building stream that'd be funny I think I I did do
15068640	15074080	that before I did it back when I was a flush streamer I did a PC building
15074080	15081720	stream on like um I forget it's not ready to be fun I don't think I would ever do
15081720	15088920	that just because of copyright issues you have to understand that I'm very
15089000	15096760	limited in what I can do without getting caught by YouTube just to be realistic
15096760	15107000	um I think I might have to get off cuz I'm in a lot of pain right now I love
15107000	15110360	building PCs I want to build one of them already I used to definitely have that
15110360	15115600	like fervorant passion for building PCs but now I'm just like I see it as more of
15115600	15123320	a chore because then I gotta make sure everything's good I'm also traumatized
15123320	15128640	because the last time I had to build my PC it was because I couldn't remember if
15128640	15132520	it was Rena or Sole through open my case fan and shorted out my motherboard in
15132520	15135640	my graphics card so I had to rebuild it and buy a lot of new parts and I was
15135640	15140280	crying and bawling my eyes out for days because it was so much money because I
15140280	15148360	had spent I'd saved the money I'd sold stuff and I remember it was so fucked
15148360	15153960	because my mom told me I think I couldn't remember if she told me it was
15153960	15161240	Rena and it was Sole if it was Sole and she told me it was Rena and she had
15161240	15168000	apparently known one of them had thrown up in my fan and heard it but didn't
15168000	15171120	stop me when I turned on the computer because I could have probably like
15171120	15174960	cleaned them off with like alcohol and like wiped it and like made sure
15174960	15179360	everything was good she never told me so I turned on my computer and it fucking
15179360	15184680	shorted it are you gonna be rich or free of your past self yeah I was like when I
15184680	15189840	was working like a really shitty job actually no it wasn't a shitty job at
15189840	15193360	all I was a fine job I was definitely underpaid but you know what can you
15193360	15201600	expect when you're like 15 yeah but I was yeah I was they threw up in the case
15201600	15207480	fan because the case fan was on top because Rena would like and Sole would
15207480	15213680	like to they like to lay on my fucking PC because they liked the heat that came
15213680	15222160	off of it now on my desk they can't do that because there's a rack there where
15222160	15227640	I usually put my some of my peripherals like at my controller and stuff and some
15227640	15234480	other peripheral stuff like wires and like all like my gloves for like
15234480	15240960	handcams and stuff and so they can't do that because then like I also had so much
15240960	15249320	cat hair and Mike like I had a constantly blow air through it when Rena and Sole
15249320	15252840	would sit on it because they just a cat hair was just accumulating crazy and
15252840	15257920	that's why I ended up getting a case that cuz like my case initially wasn't
15257920	15262240	that clear you couldn't see like the inner and the inner parts of it so like
15262240	15265760	every once in a while I have to open up my computer to see if it was okay and
15265760	15276600	then I would just see a shit on a cat hair and I was like oh yeah but yeah I'm
15276600	15284280	like I'm still don't know what plans will be for the donothon again that's far
15284280	15288640	ahead but it feels like it's approaching fast to a more months until my
15288640	15294720	birthday it's quite nerve-wracking I usually celebrate my birthday alone
15294720	15301120	usually don't celebrate it at all to be honest with you so it'll be nice to spend
15301120	15311720	it with you guys let's have a fun time cuz yeah HD app is great if you are fuel
15311720	15320760	yeah no I know I know my limits I'll get off when I want to

15357120	15372800	that matters not this area it's bunny day
15373880	15379360	being alone on a birthday even worse is not it's like my family doesn't celebrate
15379360	15385320	birthdays for religious reasons so it's like I'm used to it but since I left and
15385480	15392360	I would celebrate my birthday with friends and now I miss like not I just like

16749360	16755000	recorded I do have like I think like two people I just like there is one I was
16755000	16760600	looking through my clips to send to stronti and they're just one person who
16760600	16765720	just clips literally everything I do and I have to go through everything and I'm
16765720	16772960	like holy shit thank god though cuz I appreciate all clippers where she bees
16772960	16779640	mole I know right I want to get more moles and beauty marks on my model for
16779640	16782720	future stuff question about clips you want edited ones the ones from YouTube I
16782720	16790480	prefer like I prefer edited ones but again that's work that you're doing so if
16790480	16794080	you want to do it then that's great but if you don't if you just want to clip
16794120	16798200	like something you thought was funny I look I go through my clips and I send
16798200	16801560	them to the clippers so like if you wanted you extra work it's up to you you
16801560	16806200	don't have to you know sorry Rena's rubbing against my microphone so if you
16806200	16808880	hear some weird like snuffling noises that's her because she's standing on my
16808880	16816820	legs and she's just like like that I might have heard her for split second
16817660	16825220	Rena are you gonna purge into me we're gonna get some rain appraised
16834180	16838580	I heard her for like a split second I was like
16839340	16846260	Rena get her rubbed out okay well she's she's rubbing against the microphone
16850460	16859160	she loves to headbutt the microphone she's so funny I don't know why she does
16859160	16864540	that she's loves to sit on my lap and I'm streaming and headbutt the microphone
16864540	16869660	Rena why are you pushing off of my leg like that
16875180	16879700	cat cam me I slowly just set that up I've been I honestly I haven't been doing
16879700	16884580	it because I'm still not comfortable showing myself yet because sometimes I
16884580	16888460	do like end up in frame not like my face or anything but just like my arm or
16888460	16896820	whatever and I just want to be careful so cat cam will come a lot later now I
16896820	16904180	just scratched my fucking eyeball Rena coming in with the content sorry my
16904180	16910540	microphone's so far away from me now let me bring closer yeah it took a it's a
16910540	16915300	can you not chew on my headphones lady Jesus Christ I give you I liked it
16915300	16919420	better when you rubbing against my microphone Rena it's not a toy she's
16919420	16924060	like oh delicious she loves rubber and like the casing of my wires is rubber
16924060	16928660	and she's trying to chew on it you're so much of ish and you're such an old woman
16928660	16933540	and you just want to chew stuff Rena choose on my crocs
16933540	16938660	I'm gonna chew on my shoes she's like a fucking dog
16952020	16961620	the audacity you did that on purpose I'm not giving you I'm not giving you the
16961900	16970460	pleasure of no no go away go away you're trying to get a rise out of me it's
16970460	16975780	not working oh by the way hold on a second I needed I wanted to say this on
16975780	16985660	stream rather than say it in a tweet so when I was streaming with mercy the
16985660	16994980	other day do not on her stream or any of the girls' stream I don't care if you
16994980	17002740	do it on mine I don't give a shit don't super chat her and then say someone
17002740	17010140	else is your oh she if you were there you probably saw us all pause because we
17010140	17015620	were just like who the fuck does that but like to that person they probably
17015620	17025900	were fine with it but it's just poor etiquette and I was very irritated on
17025900	17032260	behalf of her if you do it in mine I don't care but mercy has explicitly said
17032260	17035620	before that it makes her uncomfortable when people do stuff like that and then
17035620	17042380	this person goes ahead and do it don't fucking do that also I might need to add
17042380	17045020	a rule to stop making chat about yourself because people have been doing
17045020	17052660	that lately and I'm just like um actually you're here to watch me or the
17052660	17055180	person that I'm streaming with stop making the chat about yourself you're
17055180	17058100	not a chat celebrity this is why we don't have mods that you can see because
17058100	17061660	they're gonna be try to become chat celebrities
17062700	17069380	mods peck him yeah and like I appreciate this person because they do do
17069420	17078100	Supas on my stream and they like whatever but it is if it is poor etiquette to
17078100	17086300	talk about someone who is not present and say that they are your oh she because
17086300	17090420	that was after this is when the person was gone and we were no longer
17090420	17094700	collabing with this person and it was just being mercy and we were shooting
17094740	17102660	shit that this happened and I did not like that at all I was very irritated on
17102660	17111460	behalf of mercy I'm very protective of my girls and if you hurt their feelings I
17111460	17118780	will fucking come for you I swear to God I will rip your face off and I know like
17118780	17125420	again it was innocent they probably didn't know but it's just such in such
17125420	17133620	poor tastes and I just wanted to say something about that but yeah if you if
17133620	17142420	you do Supas like to make stuff about yourself like oh this is happening to
17142420	17157060	me or like this I don't I'm sorry but do you you don't use Supa as a medium to
17157060	17160940	make a conversation about you we're all here to have fun we're all here to
17160940	17167700	escape from life we yeah I don't appreciate attention see behavior and
17167700	17176860	donations I'm sorry but I don't no yeah but you guys know what I'll call you out
17176860	17184860	yeah you guys know I'll call you out because I'm very blunt I'll probably do
17184860	17192900	a little bit more nicer than what I'm doing now but yeah but yeah you guys
17192900	17198940	know that I'm I'm nice I have my moments where I'm very nice I'll be honest with
17198940	17202020	you and I've said this to the other girls I'm very thankful for the kayfabe
17202020	17205020	that I have because I feel like I can get away with telling you guys to stop
17205020	17211300	fucking doing something stupid when I tell you to whereas if like Azura did
17211300	17215180	that people would be like probably like so off-put by it but if it's me they're
17215180	17222540	just like oh she's just being she be she's the Dom you know whereas like Azura be
17222540	17228980	like I can't believe she on me I'm such a bad son to my mommy goat goddess or
17228980	17241140	like scrawny but I you I do this because also some of the girls just don't
17241140	17246380	have the courage to say stuff like this and I will be the big sister I will say
17246380	17253260	something because I again I am very protective of my gen mates they are my
17253260	17256700	sisters when I call them my sisters they are my sisters I was birthed from
17256700	17262380	scrawny's loins or she laid an egg I don't fucking know whatever cul-de-fiche do
17262380	17276180	I put them I put them before myself I will protect their sanity and their
17276540	17281460	mental before my own because I care about them that much the Lord gets a little
17281460	17285180	weird yeah people can't correct themselves they never told what's wrong
17285180	17289300	that's why like I'll tell you guys like what I appreciate about harem what I
17289300	17292100	appreciate about you guys is that you guys are very receptive to feedback and
17292100	17296900	then again I am also I think I put it in a better way because I'm very real with
17296900	17303340	you guys I hope so angry she be as hot but scary at the same time you guys
17303380	17310900	actually haven't seen me actually mad yet if you saw me actually mad you'd
17310900	17320460	probably unsubscribe actually no no that that would not actually was never
17320460	17326300	streamed though the one time when I raged and I broke my headset I think would
17326300	17332940	have frightened some people she protects you protect but mostly importantly
17332940	17338140	she got their back exactly no you guys you guys are like you guys are very
17338140	17340860	receptive like when I like when I was getting a lot of like stuff in my
17340860	17343980	maros or this was happening or that was happening I'd be like hey guys what the
17343980	17347140	fuck's going on you guys can't do this and then they're just like oh shit okay
17347140	17351780	never mind and then it just stops and then there's like trolls and shit and
17351780	17354140	that's whatever
17354460	17363220	but also I just I say stuff and I put there are rules in place to protect
17363220	17366900	everyone as well don't forget that I want to make sure that everyone is having a
17366900	17379180	good time because after the girls then I put you there and then myself because I
17379180	17383300	am here to entertain I'm here to make you feel good I'm here to have you
17383300	17390860	heck you have a good time you come to my streams to have fun you come to my
17390860	17400260	streams for an escape and I will provide as such as I do care about you I do love
17400260	17406300	you all and I wouldn't be you know where I am without you so I say this like
17406300	17409900	every fucking stream that's because I just can't get over how thankful I am for
17409900	17416460	you guys but yeah a lot of my stuff is teasing anyways like I don't know I'm
17416460	17420380	just I'm just a very good actress you guys can't tell if I'm well I just sound
17420380	17428180	like a server second guys can't tell if I'm really mad or not I can't I didn't
17428180	17432460	know a zur has a lisp and she was like explaining it to me and I'm like that I
17432460	17437020	think that's the only reason I can't do your voice is because I can't do the
17437020	17443260	lisp because I didn't notice she had one I'm just that oblivious I suppose I am a
17443260	17451140	Sarah to lay the fertility goddess
17452580	17457380	repetition doesn't make any less meaningful so I'm glad to hear it oh
17457980	17463060	so I guess you're an Amy Wednesday if I again I want to do a stream I want to do
17463060	17468900	a collab but maybe I'll do it I think we're gonna have Amy where the fuck did
17468900	17474780	you come from she's like hi I was really good to say I want to like have like all
17474780	17479500	the girls so I can do maybe the most recent in the next group collab I'll
17479500	17483300	try to mimic all their voices and make them talk
17484060	17493980	little sister jump scare oh if you named your cat tongue eater instead
17493980	17498260	maybe it's the biggest she be fan
17499100	17510740	am a strong e strong e strong yeah cuz she says strong e she doesn't say strong
17510740	17513220	e and I'm like it's strong e she's like that's what I'm saying I'm like no
17513220	17523340	you're not your Scottish was the other day gave you a chuckle yeah if Amy's the
17523340	17530220	biggest she be fan I'm the biggest Amy fan I watch all the girls it's like it's
17530220	17533860	like what's funny for me it's like I'm also very picky about my vTubers that I
17533860	17537220	watch and I'll well if I'm not streaming I'll just watch the girl like I've I
17537220	17541420	seen the background so often when I'm doing stuff minus when she's like really
17541420	17544300	going hardcore with her dad is because then I'm like that's this isn't for me
17544300	17552140	this is for somebody else I am not the target demographic
17553740	17559420	I don't know that I don't like it but you know it's just not for me it's all
17559420	17562860	the convoluted strong e birth two girls and the reeflings are tough but she also
17562860	17567580	give birth to the reeflings it's fair it's very like America like it's very
17567580	17574180	Elden Ring Lore give you a data too if you put your cards right I am a mama
17574180	17585180	actually get it right I'm a mama she calls me mama no she doesn't I should
17585180	17588540	give that me literally that though I'm like I should give them their privacy I
17588540	17592700	love like honestly I love going into streams and watching you guys cuz I
17592700	17596940	I'll just lurk watching guys interact with the other girls I just love it so
17596940	17603140	much cuz it's so wholesome sometimes it's not but most the time it is like I
17603140	17606860	love watching just like it's and then like the different personalities of each
17606860	17610860	fan base it's just so funny like I remember watching a zero the other day
17610860	17614100	and I was just like chilling watching her like in the background she was like
17614100	17619700	playing League or whatever and then like just like how like the bleeding hearts
17619700	17630660	are so sappy it is so adorable whoa mama oh my just crack my knuckles so I'm
17630660	17635980	about to fucking crack her skull about that it's lewd summer hold some I like
17635980	17646340	that and you know pinpals are funny I the snowberries are funny the I love the
17646340	17651180	reflings as like as you guys know I was an og refling myself so I'm already
17651180	17656460	familiar with that sort of community they're always so sweet and so silly I
17656460	17664860	love I what I love about the reflings is that um it's they're like so like they
17664860	17671180	like Gosling so hard if like there's anybody that Gosling it's the reflings
17671460	17678340	like and it's like you have like like Emmy and I see and then I we and obviously
17678340	17683980	we all in mercy all have really devoted fan bases but for like but for reflings
17683980	17694060	it's like legit Gosling and then honestly the what I appreciate but
17694060	17699180	appreciate about the the snippets the senpaises are so respectful they're like
17699180	17703180	I just really appreciate you letting mercy go at your own pace if you're a
17703180	17708680	snippet excuse me the reefing is like a parasitic fish for the long time we
17708680	17722660	waited 400,000 days and hours and months but yeah I just I I'm so happy that mercy
17722660	17726500	can feel is like growing to be more comfortable with you guys it's been
17726500	17738860	3,000 years but it's just it's just nice it's nice to see how the chat reflects
17738860	17744620	the streamer yeah at the speed due because I was worried about that because
17744620	17749220	like I went false the wall I mean my false the wall I see my false the wall
17749220	17755180	and same with the zero to the very respectful and everybody goes at their
17755180	17759700	own pace me I went balls to the wall because I have a desperation and I'll
17759700	17763900	say this easily because I'm I'm open and honest with you I have a desperation to
17763900	17775140	be liked and loved so I'm like if I piss will you love me if you listen to me

19394260	19397300	But I wouldn't have it any other way. I love it here
19398180	19399300	Um
19399300	19402660	I have to go to bed. Thanks for the fun stream. Have fun. Oh my cats have the zoomies now
19403060	19405460	I don't know if you guys heard him. He like made a funny noise
19408980	19414820	Raina stand up for yourself. No, no, she does plenty. She's rain is the alpha cat in the house
19418660	19420660	So they're probably just playing
19422660	19424660	I
19426660	19428660	I
19429060	19431060	So they're probably just playing
19433780	19437460	Well, I'm the alpha cat but then like rain is in charge, you know, she's my second
19438100	19440260	Command they're in their rebellious phase. Yeah
19441380	19446180	She's fucking his statham because he just was some boomy is uh
19446740	19451780	Boomy and fia just turned a year old because they're they're still little babies. They're still kittens in my eyes and raina's 14
19453460	19455620	So they they verse they uh
19456500	19457940	definitely
19458260	19460260	Tests their matriarch very often
19461140	19462820	but um
19462820	19468100	Raina really has warmed up to fia and I think cuz fia reminds her a lot of her sister soley
19468180	19472580	They have very similar personalities. So she'll often snuggle with fia. It's very cute
19474420	19476420	Um, but yeah, raina put some in their place
19477780	19483460	They're just it's so funny how like similar cats and dogs are a lot more similar than you think with like their hierarchal system
19484660	19486020	um
19486020	19489140	Yeah, they are little babies my little babies
19490500	19493220	I wanted raina to have a friend
19494660	19498820	Um, it's actually none of those spellings. It's rain with an a
19500020	19501860	um
19501860	19505300	I wanted raina to have a friend because I was um
19506900	19511220	Going back to work after working from home for six months. So I didn't want her to be alone
19512100	19515700	In a new apartment by herself. And so I got boomy
19515860	19520740	I never had a boy or like a male cat before because I was just like, oh, let me try getting a male cat
19520820	19523060	I shouldn't have done that. I should have just stayed with the female cat
19523620	19529220	Um, not that I wish I did to get boomy. I love boomy. He's my little son my little boy. Um,
19529780	19532260	But she fucking hated him
19532900	19538820	Hated him so much. I was I was like, I don't know if it was like and I did all the proper things
19538900	19541780	Like I made sure they're in separate rooms. They're in separate rooms for a long time
19541860	19546820	I would like move towels around so they could smell each other like how you properly introduce a cat
19547540	19554020	And she fucking hated him and she still does. Um, it's funny because boomy has the biggest crush on raina
19554740	19557460	100% he's just like give me some of that koo grass
19558180	19560180	because it'll like he'll
19560420	19563220	Koo at her to play like he'll like get real low and be like
19563220	19565220	Oh
19565860	19568900	And then raina would just like be like this is like walk away
19569940	19573540	Like he tries to like he doesn't do that to fia. He doesn't do that
19573620	19578980	He only does that to raina and it's so funny to me. Hi boomy speak of the devil. Hi. Here's your boy
19579380	19582580	What are you doing? You just sitting and watching me? Can I get a headbutt?
19583540	19585540	Oh
19586580	19588580	Um
19588740	19592420	He wants a woman who hates him for real. Yeah, um
19593380	19595860	But then like he and I always was worried
19596820	19600820	Uh because boomy is like so much bigger than raina and I'm like, oh crap
19600900	19603860	Is boomy gonna become like the dominant cat? But no, he's not
19604740	19608740	Raina still puts him in his place and boomy is such a pussy. Like he's scared
19609460	19613700	He's such a he's such a dick, but then he just gets like you will
19614580	19618100	Accidentally move too fast and he will sprint
19618660	19623460	Into my laundry room and hide behind my laundry machine and I'm just like bro
19623620	19629780	It's I literally accidentally knocked the remote off the couch onto the carpet. It wasn't a loud noise
19629860	19631860	It was like a like a little
19631860	19633860	Fump noise and he'll just freak out
19634180	19636180	Boomy is literally awesome
19637300	19643220	Um, that'll be some alter women and he just I don't know if you heard the noise he just made um
19643940	19646980	and then fias uh then since I realized that
19648180	19654740	It wasn't I was a little bit greedy in getting a kitten for raina because I thought it would be easier for her to like
19655460	19659780	Dominate which it still that was true, but I thought they would take to each other a lot better
19660500	19662180	um
19662180	19665700	But they didn't and I I think it's is because that boomy is male
19666420	19671060	Um, although he's not like intact or anything. He's fixed. But then I so I got fia
19671860	19673300	so like
19673300	19675300	Boomy would have a playmate
19675780	19677780	as a kitten that can match his energy
19678580	19680100	and um
19680100	19684660	Then rena would have like a female companion and then it's everything's perfect like
19686260	19693700	Yeah, rena loves snuggling with fia fia was so I was I made the joke so when rena was sick
19695220	19700820	I was like fia you better not live up to your name because fia comes from fia the deathbed companion
19701620	19703780	From elden ring because I love elden ring so much
19704580	19708340	and yeah, no expected kid unexpected kids. No, thank you and um
19709860	19711860	But in but fia was like
19713620	19715620	So close like she was
19715620	19718980	With rena constantly like she was snuggling her
19719540	19722260	She was making sure she was good. She was grooming her
19722980	19727460	And I was worried because I'm like, oh is this mean like it might be the end for rena. She's older
19727620	19729620	Like I had already mentally prepared for that
19729940	19731140	but no
19731140	19737860	Reina fucking bounce back into zoom in and whatever and they just they're like really close together if they're really cute. Um
19739140	19742580	Yes, they're playing elden ring tomorrow. Yeah speaking of um
19743700	19748260	And then yeah, I always call boomy and fia the twins. They're not actually related. Um
19748980	19753060	They came from different litters. I they're both rescues from
19753700	19755700	Mississippi from the south
19755700	19761060	I went to the same um rescuer who was this really nice lady and um
19763380	19765380	One of the uh
19765380	19769620	Fia's was the sweetest girl. She's like, I've never met a more snuggly cat in my life
19770820	19774100	Oh, she's pregnant at grandpa company. Um
19776340	19778340	Yeah
19778660	19783620	How do I spell Mississippi mi ssi ssi ppi
19784580	19786580	I gotta sing it
19786660	19788660	But it's funny because they look
19788660	19790660	They look very similar
19791460	19794740	mi ssi ssi ppi. How is that wrong?
19799540	19803220	Are you from Mississippi? Never mind. Um
19806100	19808980	No, right. Thank you actually. Um
19809540	19810740	Um
19810740	19813380	They look a lot alike because I I really like
19814340	19817860	I love Siamese cats. I've always grown up with Siamese cats. I've had um
19818980	19820980	Three other Siamese cats before them
19821940	19823940	because I had um
19826020	19828980	Mari, Naomi and Salah
19830420	19832420	And um sadly
19833620	19838340	A lot like because of I like I don't think I'll ever go to a breeder again
19839060	19840740	um
19840740	19846340	Because and then my well, I didn't go it was my mom, but like I don't think I would ever get a cat from a breeder again
19846980	19852420	um just because like the health issues that even purebred cats can have um because uh
19854980	19856980	Salah died at 11
19858180	19861220	Naomi died when she was three which really sucked because she had cancer
19862020	19863460	and then
19863460	19866580	Mari died, I think at five or whatever. I can't really
19867300	19868500	know
19868500	19873540	Oh my god, did you hear that? That's boomy if you heard that he's running around
19874340	19876340	um
19876340	19882180	But yeah, so I got rescues this time because I wanted to give like some cats a chance. I was debating whether or not to
19883620	19886580	Get a what was that? I was boomy
19887460	19888580	um
19888580	19895060	I was debating whether or not to get an older cat because like what my dream would be because a lot of people neglect older animals
19895300	19896340	um
19896340	19899940	and I would love to get like a home and like a little cool like cat area
19900580	19903060	or like dog area where I can like um
19904180	19906180	Kind of like adopt dogs
19906980	19908980	that are older
19909140	19911460	um or cats that are older and kind of just like
19912420	19915620	Take care of them until their last days because everybody deserves that
19915620	19920180	You know, you don't deserve to be sitting in a shelter for that and just give them all the love and care and affection that they
19920900	19922900	deserve because everybody deserves that
19923540	19924980	um
19925460	19927460	and uh
19928340	19930500	Yeah, it would be really cool to do that
19930660	19936420	So I was debating whether to get an older cat but for rena's comfort ability. I got a kitten because I know she could handle a kitten
19937460	19939220	um
19939220	19940340	but yeah
19940340	19941860	fia is
19941860	19948100	Really cool because I've never seen a cat like a lynx point like her before she's technically a lilac point simis
19948180	19950180	Which is like very light purpley
19950740	19951860	color
19951860	19956420	But she has the lynx markings because I'm assuming that her dad or her mom was a tabby cat
19957220	19958660	and um
19958660	19962260	But or might have been like also a type of gray point cat because that's
19963140	19965140	cat genetics aren't weird
19966180	19973860	So she her skin is almost like purple rather than pink and she's very like lavender colored like her gray is like lavender
19973860	19975860	and which funny is that
19975860	19978980	fiala and I think check check of sabaki in her check
19979540	19980980	um means
19980980	19985140	means lavender so it also worked out that way so I can explain that to people
19986260	19990980	instead of fia the deathbed companion of fia from like a normie a person asks
19994900	20000980	Unless you're breeding for livestock or some kind of specific work rescues the more economical and morally superior choice
20001220	20006340	Yeah, the only reason why my mom got purebred simis is because she wanted
20006740	20009860	simis cats are the only cat that my mom wasn't really allergic to
20010580	20013860	Um, and so if she she thought if we got like some sort of mix
20014100	20015460	It would make her sick
20015460	20019620	And then she ends up still being like solea was fine, but rena for some reason
20020020	20022500	Um rena's dander is like bad
20023380	20027540	Like I'm mildly allergic to rena, but I'll still shove my face into her anyways because I love her to death
20028180	20029380	um
20029380	20031380	You know have a good one
20032180	20035380	Uh, but yeah, sorry. I'm like talking about my cats
20036820	20038820	I'm sorry. I'm yapping
20039860	20041860	About my cats
20042740	20049140	I can talk about my cats for like what else do I have to talk about? I'm just a fucking old lady hanging out with three cats. I'm sorry
20049940	20051700	You can continue
20051700	20058580	Why do you apologize because I'm I'm just an apologetic person. I'm just used to apologizing for a lot of shit. Okay. It's trauma. Okay. It's trauma enough
20061780	20065220	Um, I will continue to apologize for the raps. It'll never stop
20065540	20067540	You did
20069060	20072500	I thought about a pure bird myself. I'm wondering so perhaps with a cat something to the problem
20072580	20078020	Yeah, I've also like I wanted to get a pure bed dog for like protection and get them specially trained for that
20078340	20080340	Um, like a working dog
20087860	20091220	That's rena rena, what are you doing?
20095860	20097860	Oh
20099460	20101460	Reina
20108260	20114020	Hey, boomie, what are you doing to her? She's trying to sing the song of her people and you're fucking up her song
20114660	20116660	Are you okay, rena? Did you guys hear that?
20117780	20119780	My cats are
20120020	20121220	Yeah
20121220	20123220	They're fighting
20123380	20127780	Yeah, that that was rena running around from boomie because sometimes they fight over um
20129620	20131460	Our boomie just doesn't know where to stop. Let me check
20132420	20134420	Reina, are you good? She's fine
20134660	20136660	boomie
20137220	20140820	What are you doing? You know you did something bad. You were hiding from me
20142580	20145460	What are you doing? Don't give me that look
20148900	20150900	Why are you chasing her like that?
20153940	20160100	Hey, would you give a reason to do these? You have plenty of toys on the ground that you can play with or you can play with fia
20161860	20164260	Must be as hiding from you because you're being a menace
20165780	20168340	Who means like avoiding eye contact with me? He's just like
20171540	20173540	Why are you sure? Why are you doing that?
20176020	20178020	If you're spraying
20178180	20181380	Whether the game you're spraying the play with we have to find you another one
20183300	20184980	What?
20184980	20186980	What?
20187540	20189540	Are you grumpy because you want to go into the fridge?
20195780	20197780	All right, I did catch an answer
20199620	20205220	What are you doing? I want to get you a little more low tide. You look very dapper in a low tide
20206660	20209160	You know labor alone. She doesn't want to play right now
20213220	20215220	Oh
20215460	20218420	Yeah, I warned you you get back
20227620	20229620	Let's go home you guys
20232500	20234500	Raina are you okay?
20243220	20245220	Okay
20254580	20256580	Okay, Raina in my arms
20259060	20261780	You might hear a growl because she's irritated
20263540	20270020	And when she sees if even if i'm holding her and but boomie or fear all around and she's in a bad mood she'll like
20270900	20272900	Irritatedly meow at them
20276020	20278020	Hi
20278100	20280100	We shall
20283060	20285620	Are you grumpy because boomie's chasing you
20290660	20294660	I will protect you from all around
20295780	20297780	I will be here don't
20298340	20301140	Cry it's funny because now she's purring
20312020	20315460	Fia, can you not grab my wire? It's literally like I have three kids
20316260	20320260	Except one's the oldest and then I have two twins that are just like fucking
20321300	20323300	cracked out
20323780	20325780	Oh
20326100	20331060	No, fia, don't try to bap her fucking tail. Fia's like right under my desk trying to
20333300	20340980	Try to paw at raina's tail. I know she was just trying to see raina likes to hop into my my um
20342180	20344180	bathtub
20344980	20346980	And just yell
20347300	20353620	I think she likes the acoustics in the bathtub. Oh, you want a hug? I'll give you a hug, Raina
20355700	20357700	When a purr
20359620	20363220	You want to head but the mic oh there they go
20367300	20369300	Boomie
20369380	20371380	Oh
20371620	20377940	Boomie, let's leave fia alone. Jesus. What is on what is wrong with you today? Okay, hold on
20379940	20386260	You might hear fia like yell in a moment. Yeah, that was Raina though. Hold on a second
20387380	20390100	Boomie, you're done. You're done. Come here
20391860	20393860	Come here, mister
20393940	20395620	Get up
20395620	20397620	Come on
20397780	20402180	No, don't try to cutely lick my foot. Come here
20403700	20408420	Come here get up. Why are you so fat? You're not fat. You're just heavy
20409620	20411620	Can you get up?
20412900	20418100	You're literally you know where I'm bringing you because when sometimes when boomie gets too much I have to put them in the crate
20427620	20429620	So
20446260	20448660	My ear boomie like meow in a moment
20451060	20453060	But he's he's being too much
20453460	20455460	I
20460580	20466100	Want attention to go to bed. I've given them attention all day today before I streamed
20468020	20470020	The juicy cat drama
20471300	20474180	They're catnip if they're catnip, do you think that they'd be chill?
20474180	20476180	Yeah
20479860	20484900	Sometimes like what's funny about boomie is he hates it when the cats like play independently without him
20485300	20487300	He like has to be a part of it
20487300	20491220	Like fia was just playing with like a ball and that's when boomie came over and just started like
20491860	20493860	Abiding her and I'm like dude
20495540	20500500	Booby apology video coming soon. We start riding like silent
20501460	20507460	These kittens are bouncing around jumping up walls keeping up with the cotton bums. That's actually really cute
20508500	20513220	Uh, except make the c into a k so I can be like a Kardashian or some shit
20516180	20522500	Yeah, sometimes boomie um forgets that he's so much bigger than the other girls. I've actually like
20523300	20527860	Debated getting another boy cat just for him just for a little like buddy
20528100	20534020	But I don't think I can sneak four cats in my apartment. So I'm just gonna
20536180	20540900	Speaking of that I have to reapply for my housing for my apartment and I don't know really how to do it
20541620	20542740	because
20542740	20544740	Since I don't have a job right now
20549780	20556820	Sorry I heard meowing that again fia only meows when she plays with a toy so but she sounds like she's like hurt but she's not
20558020	20562500	He's like meow meow meow and I'm like, are you okay?
20563780	20565780	So she's fine
20566420	20568660	She just gets really that's her excited meow
20574100	20576600	Boomie is cute. Yeah, he is a cutie
20582340	20584340	Yeah, hold on
20588500	20590500	Are you gonna chill?
20607620	20609620	I have a little crate for them
20613860	20615860	It's almost like a dog crate
20617860	20621860	But you can create a cat I used to create fia once you couldn't
20623460	20627540	She was sick to look that when we wouldn't try to play with her
20628420	20630420	She was very good
20632420	20636900	It's really weird telling you time these cats are very similar to mom
20647860	20649860	You
20672420	20674420	Have to sit she be
20674820	20681540	Yeah, no, they just sent me a notice to renew that's why I'm like, oh I have to fill that out

20684980	20686420	um
20686420	20691060	So yeah, I have filled out a little bit of it today. I have to reach out to my former boss and be like hi
20692180	20694340	Can you let them know that I'm not there?
20696020	20699060	Can you prove to them that I'm no longer employed?
20700180	20702180	Because yeah, again
20702740	20704740	It's just
20706340	20708340	Bro, it's so stupid. Why can't I just like live?
20709140	20713940	I can't wait to buy my own house in like a couple years or something. That'd be so so so nice
20716100	20718980	Oh my dreams won't come true
20719220	20721220	Oh
20730740	20734500	I don't know what goes okay. Yeah, me too. They gave me a hard time last time
20736500	20739540	So I'm hoping that they don't give me a hard time this time
20741380	20744900	Buy a house with a basement for the hair to be lost
20745460	20747460	I

20752980	20759460	Okay, I wanted to see if I can stream till midnight but because my cats are being very rowdy and they're distracting me a lot

20902100	20904100	um

21016180	21022100	I don't uh, my boobs aren't that stretchy to do that with a 3DO. I'm sorry the 3DO is a bit longer
21022340	21025380	Whereas this is like a simple at 2020
21027300	21029300	That's a little bit

21053460	21056100	She ended it by smacking us with her boob
21057460	21060100	And tucking us between them and giving us a hug
21061380	21063380	I like how I haven't left yet

21179060	21182100	In the names. I didn't pick anything. I'm just here. I'm just a voice
21183060	21185060	strawney was like, you know what?
21185780	21191300	Your voice. I'm sorry to smack my mic because I'm waggling my finger. Your voice is the one that I want
21192020	21195700	There's a one that I want a lot a lot a lot a lot
21196900	21199780	If it was up to me, I'd be cute and funny and I'd be brown
21200740	21202740	I'd be a nice tan
21202900	21204900	cute and funny
21205380	21207380	character
21212340	21215140	I do like my drill hair I like it a lot
21221300	21223300	I
21227300	21230100	Like a brown cat. Yeah, like a brown cat
21232420	21234580	Not go I can't imagine you was a little
21236820	21239780	Do they know does he know?
21242100	21244100	That's what I was before
21245780	21247780	Before I was hired on
21248740	21250740	Yeah, boomie exactly
21254820	21257460	What are you doing? Why are you attacking the carpet?
21258980	21262740	What is the what did the carpet do to you dude?
21266260	21268260	He's like a dog I swear to god
21271540	21273540	Yeah, I was I was very cute funny
21274020	21276020	I
21276580	21278580	Talked about about it before
21280100	21282980	Sorry, you guys can hear scuffling. That's boomy
21284820	21286820	He's chewing on the carpet
21289460	21291940	What is wrong with you there's nothing under there
21294740	21299460	Boomy there's nothing under the carpet that you need. It's probably like a piece of fucking litter
21299460	21301460	Oh
21302020	21304020	My god, he's ridiculous
21304660	21306660	um
21307140	21309140	Crazy cat
21309940	21314180	Transfer students shows up and even pink was on gonga homanga bonga gongas
21317060	21320500	Um, let me hear the voices he smells it's fear
21322100	21324100	It's like it's here. I love will follow
21325060	21327060	Yeah, I can't wait. Um
21328020	21330980	I'm already thinking about ideas for the 2.0
21332660	21334660	um
21335620	21337620	Yeah, boomy knows what's up
21343380	21345780	Lead hours boomy starts tweaking
21346980	21348980	He's literally always tweaking
21350020	21355380	That's that's how he meows though. He doesn't like meow meow. He just makes that noise
21357620	21359620	It's really funny
21361060	21363060	Sometimes he'll actually meow and it honestly
21363780	21370340	Shocks me now. So I'm just like, what did you what did you just open your mouth and do an actual meow instead of just like hum?
21375300	21378740	I think what's the matter? Why'd you just hop this is boomy nearby?
21381220	21384180	The hair I'm at 3 am is pretty much boomy incarnate
21385060	21391620	Bro is doing sideways some results on the he was you don't understand. So I don't think
21392660	21395300	So what boomy was doing? He was laying on his side
21396180	21398180	and he was pulling himself
21398340	21401460	Across my hardwood floor because I have a little carpet under my chair
21401460	21406100	So doesn't make noise when it rolls around and so he's pulling himself across a carpet
21407860	21412180	On his side with his head and it's just like and then he was kicking it with his back feet
21414260	21417220	He's dragging himself along with his claws and I'm just like, okay
21418020	21422580	Um, are you good or do I like I just gave him a toy to play with he doesn't care
21423620	21425620	um
21425620	21429380	Another thing before before of course fucking boomy derail stuff
21430420	21432420	I don't remember
21432900	21434900	Oh, but yeah, so like um
21437140	21439140	Yeah, just
21439780	21441780	I don't think
21442500	21446980	I would like I would like to be cute playing again because I like speaking in my higher voice
21448260	21452020	But the thing is I don't think I could do patreon audio in my higher voice
21453540	21457540	So it would definitely be like a big gap my way moment
21459780	21465220	Maybe I could I don't know I haven't really tried because I can maintain the voice for a long time like emmy does
21465460	21467460	Um
21469620	21471620	Callous this
21473300	21475300	I was gonna make a joke whenever man
21476180	21478180	um
21478900	21482100	Higher voice works with this model. Yeah, it does like you guys
21482740	21483780	um
21483780	21489700	It's funny when you don't see when you see my like not my boob chest, but like my upper chest up
21490100	21495860	Like a higher voice works really well. Hi everyone. Hi, my name is she be cotton bum
21496820	21498020	um
21498020	21504260	And then when you see just my head and you don't see the like the pointiness of my chin. I look very cute and funny
21506340	21509700	Yeah, the british voice audio like really a lot of people liked it
21509940	21512740	That's funny because I can do that higher pitch british
21513220	21518580	Voice without the need of the voice changer too. I don't know why the voice changer makes it for people
21520100	21522100	Because I can go up that high
21523860	21525860	British
21527060	21533380	Hi again, it's me british she be um, I don't know if you missed me or anything, but
21534340	21537460	I know I missed you. Um, it's been
21538340	21542900	Really difficult not being able to see you these last few days. Uh
21543940	21547860	I hope you don't mind that um, I missed you so much
21548100	21552340	I just can't help that. I love you immensely
21555220	21559220	Don't don't take it the wrong way though. I just
21561940	21563940	British conny she be
21566420	21571300	British she be could be the way to yeah, we just become velour uh eu
21571300	21573300	I
21576900	21578900	Thank you forever
21580100	21584580	Yeah, it's really funny you and people a lot of people didn't think it was me as she be
21585220	21589300	Um from my pl because they're like their voices are different and then
21590180	21592180	I'm like it's voice acting
21592980	21595220	But like I do sound like my pl
21596180	21599140	Like it it comes out sometimes when I'm very excited
21599620	21604660	Oh my god, we're gonna fucking beat this guy. I swear to fucking god. I swear to god. I'm gonna kick his ass
21604740	21607060	Especially when I'm playing like like I'll just goes up
21607860	21609860	um
21611060	21613060	Yeah
21613060	21615060	So it kept up the fit
21616020	21618020	Voice acting isn't real
21618740	21620740	What are you saying?
21625780	21631780	Yeah, all these voices are mine. They're just they're all separate people just leaning into the microphone
21634980	21638180	Wait, is mercy streaming today? I don't think she is
21641780	21644260	Vilaire, but if us lost the revolutionary war
21646660	21648660	Um
21649780	21651780	Because voice changers exist
21652740	21654740	Oh, I guess that's true
21661460	21666580	Hmm guys, I don't go on vacation until the 18th. It's like I still have a week
21667780	21674020	I watched arena a little bit before Vilaire could hardly tell too. Oh, thank you. That's a compliment
21674100	21683220	Shebethany's inseparate it is shebethany comes to like just like I let her into my apartment and then she comes and she speaks to the mic
21688740	21690740	I'm already missing man. I'm right here
21692500	21694980	Oh, I'm gonna be gone until the 23rd
21697220	21699220	The 23rd
21704580	21709140	Yes, I've told chat before I'm going to see my grandparents
21711940	21714180	In florida florida
21715620	21717620	Why are you looking at me like that, rena?
21717620	21718740	Hey
21718740	21723620	Why are you so snuggly today? You've been stuck to me like, ooh, you know, I'm leaving soon, huh?
21724260	21726260	But you get to see grandma
21727140	21733460	We're technically our mom because my mom always say that me and rena and sale were sisters and she was just raising three daughters
21734580	21736580	So I guess rena's my sister
21741860	21747540	Florida man, I know it's gonna be fucking sweltering. I'm not looking forward to it
21752020	21756580	Yeah, no, I might I might I'm debating whether or not do you know bible study or not
21758260	21760260	Just because I won't be able to bible study
21764980	21772500	I had a cat sister too. I know I'm like I don't like the south for that reason
21776420	21782340	My bible I think no bible study would be fun enough for doing it together. Yeah
21784900	21786900	We should suffer
21787460	21791220	I know I'm nervous. That's why I'm nervous like I don't want my stuff to get delayed
21792100	21794580	I'm very anxious because I have a layover as well
21795460	21800100	That's another reason because I'm uh, yeah, I said this earlier, but I'm flying by myself
21800980	21805940	Because like I haven't gone to see my grandparents by myself in a very long time since I was like 16
21806100	21809780	They've been up here, but like they're older. They can't really travel that well. My parents are busy
21810100	21812100	They also my parents just left without me
21812740	21814740	recently to go see them
21815780	21819380	And I'm pissed about that so I'm going it's now my turn to go down and see them
21821860	21824340	I was secretly hoping my parents would pay for me, but they did not
21825540	21827220	They're like, sorry
21827220	21829220	They're on your own and I'm like
21832580	21834580	Yeah, I'll be I'll be getting good food
21836260	21838260	I see you
21838580	21840580	Haitian food
21841220	21842820	um
21842820	21844820	Yeah, spend time with family
21844820	21848660	It's always nice. I sometimes you need that and I think I need to disconnect a little bit
21849620	21851620	Because I'm literally on the computer like every day
21852500	21855000	Like I don't mind it, but I like I know in general. It's not healthy
21857540	21860820	And I'm like, oh, maybe I'll fix my um sleep schedule. I'm there
21864820	21867860	So quality flavor in the cell, yeah, I'm gonna get some like barbecue or something
21868740	21873940	They eaten Florida gators. I've never had gator. I don't even know if my grandparents have eaten gator
21874020	21876260	The long time that they've lived down there
21878660	21880660	I
21882180	21888180	Think he is gonna help out preventing I don't know. Yeah, it's not I'm not taking a vacation because I'm burning and like I'm
21889220	21892980	I'm feeling burnt out. This is like something I planned a while ago
21894420	21896420	Like before I was in velar
21897220	21898980	so
21898980	21900980	um
21900980	21902980	So don't worry about that
21903060	21909300	Because if it was up to me I'd keep going I was I was literally saying earlier like oh
21909300	21911300	I'd bring my laptop with me
21911300	21916580	If I could if I had a microphone that I could bring because like my at 2020 is a is a condenser mic
21916660	21919540	So it needs to be plugged into a mixer and stuff
21920660	21922660	um
21923620	21928820	Or I just bring it with me and just like walk myself in the guest bedroom and just like yeah
21929300	21932100	I'm trying not to swear in front of my christian family
21933860	21939780	What time is it it's 12 o' seven you guys kept me talking you little bitches
21941940	21943940	You whores
21947380	21952900	Because I'm like why are people saying good night and I'm like wait I've been talking longer than eight minutes just 15
21952900	21954900	No, I'm not staying up till one
21956660	21959060	If I'm me also Bible studies. Yeah
21963940	21968980	Swap out swears with bible verses. Oh, matthew mark. Look at john
21971300	21975460	Holy judges, are you sawming me right now?
21979300	21981780	Oh my revelations
21987220	21990500	Thank goodness my family does not bible study at all the time brother
21991460	21993460	You Corinthians
21994500	21996500	You
21997620	21999620	Oh my genesis
22001460	22004980	You know lord and saints names in vain those aren't saints
22006820	22011220	How long do you throw gifts normally take to arrive it really depends on the seller sometimes like
22012020	22015300	One time I forget what one of you guys got me from like amazon
22015700	22020180	Um, but the I also can't tell if it's like it's technically from amazon most stuff is from amazon
22020900	22023300	um when you guys buy stuff, um
22025700	22028580	And it literally showed up like the next fucking day and I was like what?

22041620	22047860	You're acting like a real Judas right now, but that's a bible character. I'm I was saying bible books
22051300	22054020	The heels don't yeah like the heels still haven't come in yet
22056740	22061380	They like recently shipped a couple days ago and those were ordered like weeks ago
22068260	22072500	Like my psalms, but it's not poms. It's psalms
22076900	22078900	Hold back the seas for a week. Yeah
22081060	22083060	I
22087460	22092420	Have this idea for a gift and I wouldn't want it to get there when you're gone. Oh understandable
