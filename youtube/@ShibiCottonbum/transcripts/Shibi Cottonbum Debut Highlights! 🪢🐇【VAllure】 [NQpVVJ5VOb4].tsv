0	9840	Hello. Hi there. Hello, sweetheart. My name is Sheevy Cottonbomb. I'm your mistress and the
9840	17040	madam of Wonderland. I bet you enjoyed Emmy's debut. Isn't she just the cutest? Hope she didn't
17040	24400	put too much of a spell on you. Okay, well, now you do well to behave and listen. However,
24400	29600	first things first, we're gonna practice some obedience. So I'm gonna have you try
29600	34160	something for me. Can you say aha or type A's in the chat?
39040	49760	Good job. I'm so proud of you. Okay, so hold on. Let me just come and set up my desk. So yeah,
49760	54800	I know my desk is messy. I'll clean it off later. As mentioned, my name is Sheevy, but you must
54800	61280	refer to me as Madam or Ms. Sheevy, if you like. My surname may sound silly to you, but it's a known
61280	68560	fact in my family that we have buns of steel. My last name just showcases that. I was born on
68560	75760	September 28th, which just happens to be Monday. My parents just seems to have really gotten the
75760	84320	timing right, I suppose. I am pretty tall in my family at 168 centimeters. That's a five, six,
84320	91840	and a miracle if you didn't know. I'm a lap and polla, otherwise known as a bunny girl. You see,
91840	98640	I have a lovely set of floppy ears in this picture right there. I can also DJ like I just can't
99120	105920	I have the many characteristics of a rabbit, like my stamina, for example. I'm also very good at
105920	111200	jumping and have quite the vertical. My family is mad at me, though, because I didn't pick up
111200	118720	basketball like a distant relative of mine. So my age, that's really quite rude of you to wonder.
118720	127360	And although I might have some motherly qualities, I'm not old enough to be your mother. In human
127360	133120	languages, I only fluently know English, but pleasure doesn't really need words, does it?
134240	141360	I'm also fluent in bunspeak, but my accent and pitch, it really only comes out if I'm excited.
141360	150640	So normally it sounds like this. But I get really excited talking to you guys, and this is very rare.
151200	158080	This is what I sound like. So let's look at my likes and dislikes. So first of my likes,
158080	164960	I really do enjoy a wide range of music genres. I can't sing well, but I try my best and I just
164960	170480	try to have fun with it. Huge fan of really any sort of techno with bass and thump, you can really
170480	177360	feel anything that makes me move. Besides country, the only good songs to come from country are
177360	184560	Ram Ranch and Save a Horse Ride a Cowboy. I'm not the pickiest eater, but I do have my favorites.
184560	191680	I love love love a seafood. I'm a woman of opulent taste, lobster. My mother also always prided in
191680	198000	how well I ate my veggies as a wee rabbit. I even like Brussels sprouts. I love fa and Spanish food
198000	204080	as well. And I have a few junky comfort foods like Uncrustables. I f***ing love Uncrustables
204080	208720	and Puppy Chow. I have that really rarely though, because you know, I gotta keep up with this nice
208720	217920	figure. So from my hobbies, when I'm not in the dungeon, I mean managing the Wonderland Hotel,
217920	224800	you can catch me reading a book, practicing my knots. As you can see, I do jujitsu. One time
224800	232640	during a jujitsu class, I accidentally put a pier to sleep with just my thighs. Whoopsies. I do
232720	237280	watch a lot of anime, but I'm probably kind of labeled like a normie for my taste. I recently
237280	243360	watched Dungeon Meshie and Three Rin, you know. If the theme is really sci-fi or fantasy, I like it.
243360	250160	Like Firefly, Stargate, Star Wars. I'm a freaking nerd. Don't tell anybody though. I have to keep
250160	256080	up an air of mystery. Some games you'll see me play will be like meta-ish games. I love Inscription.
256080	261200	I like Souls Likes like Elden Ring. I like Liza P. I really want to dive into more retro games.
261200	266880	I also like RPG story-driven games like Elder Scrolls, horror games like Alien and Amnesia.
266880	273120	And I recently discovered I like Relics like Halt of the Lamb. I'm embarrassed to admit this.
273120	278880	I played a lot of FPS growing up like Counter Strike 2, so I'm trying to widen my horizons.
278880	285760	Let's just not talk about my 600 plus hours. Okay, these are kind of self-explanatory.
285760	289360	Don't play your music too loud. Nobody else wants to hear it. I don't like being in really large
289360	294800	crowds. It just freaks me out. I don't like when somebody disobeys me. Do not disobey me.
294800	300800	Don't like when people correct me. I'm the one giving correction. All right. And I hate getting
300800	305760	interrupted during any sort of playtime, and I hate when people put things in the wrong place.
306400	311440	It's there. I like organized chaos. So here are some of my goals. I like to beat a Souls Likes
311440	315840	on stream. I'd be in Elden Ring already, and I'd be in Liza P. Offstream, but you know,
315840	319440	I would like to do something with you. I would like to learn another language because
319440	323520	everybody else is super cool, and I'm not, and they all know other languages. So I want to have
323520	329760	a video hit 100k views and hit 10k subs because if I reach those milestones, I know I'm doing
329760	333920	something right and that you guys are enjoying my content. I want to go to a convention as a
333920	338800	robot like they're doing at off-key right now and be like, hey, and just try to like hit people
338800	342480	with it. I think that'd be really fun. I would love to release another cover. You guys will see
342480	347280	that we have covers coming up. Mine's not good, but you know, we can try again. I would love to
347280	354400	voice in an anime or some other form of animation. I would love to travel, off-clad with the girlies,
354400	358320	and I want to make amazing friends in other companies, you know? There's a lot of amazing
358320	362000	talents out there that I would love to get to know. Here's my general art tag. This is Sheebie
362000	368320	Art. We're not going too crazy with it. My alternative, my naughty art tag is Abundage.
368320	374560	Memes are Bunwild. My live is Sheebie Live. Clips are a cotton bum clip. And my fan name,
374560	379440	we're going to pick it together in my 2.0. I came up with harem this morning.
379440	385680	Myoshi Marks are a rope and a bunny. It's pretty self-explanatory. Okay, so my first impressions
385680	390560	of the girls, I put like where I would take them on a date. So first, Rani, she's hardworking,
390560	394160	and I know she loves Lord of the Rings. So we're watching all of the Lord of the Ring
394160	398080	movies together while we snuggle. Mercy, I would take her to a steak house
398080	403280	because knives. She's dangerous. She lives life on the edge. Get it? High fedge.
403280	408000	Azura, I want to cook a meal together with her and take her in a picnic. Probably something milk-based.
408000	412560	I think she'd be able to provide that. Getting ice cream with icy would be amazing.
412560	417600	If we could just watch the sunset, you know, all the aurora borealis. We go back to her hometown.
417600	421760	For Amy, I want to take her to a coffee shop with a bookstart and feeder pastry. She's so
421760	426400	cute. I just want to stuff her little face with food and then find her more grimoire so she can,
426400	430400	you know, get her bro back. I don't really know what they got going on, but it's something. I want
430400	437360	to give a huge thank you to SquishyGoogle and Nari. They did such an amazing job. If they hadn't
437360	441760	done all the work that they did, I would not be here. None of the girls would be here. And here
441760	447360	is also a thank you to all these other wonderful people who, without their help, I wouldn't have
447360	452720	all this cool stuff. Like, thank you. Guys, work so freaking hard. I appreciate it so much. Okay,
452720	460800	let's go to my bedroom. I can shut myself off. Hello. Hi. You can see my beautiful face. I'll
460800	467760	go through. Hold on. Let me just... So you got my beautiful feet. My little stompers. I'm gonna step
467760	475600	on you with them. My long, luscious legs covered with my beautiful tights. And then, you know,
475680	480000	naturally I'm wearing shabar roads. But don't get it twisted. Just because I'm tied up doesn't mean
480000	485440	I'm not going to be the one calling the shots. Okay, sweetheart. All right. Somebody asked,
485440	491840	does these ropes leave marks? Yes. I like to wear a really lacy lingerie. I mean,
491840	495440	this is just a shirt. It's just a normal shirt. I don't know what you're talking about. And then
495440	502560	my lovely choker. It's very avant garde, don't you think? And then we have my beautiful face. I'm
502640	508320	gonna quickly run through my toggles. We got blushing. We got sweating and blushing. We got
508320	515680	hard eyes sweating and blushing. I can be really, really dark if you disappoint me. I'd be really
515680	522720	upset. My love, did you do that? Piece of shit. And I can try. Which is rare. So I'm not gonna use
522720	529760	that for long. I can have a real mouth. And then I can be like, holy crap. When were you gonna tell
529760	538960	me you're so small? And then I can question my life choices. Have a leash. Yeah, you're on my leash,
538960	545760	baby boy. I can also bop you. So be good. You're not gonna like where this goes. At long last,
545760	554080	the time for edging is over. Release roof links and feast your eyes on the lovely Scottish
554080	566560	fish, straw me. Give her all my love.
