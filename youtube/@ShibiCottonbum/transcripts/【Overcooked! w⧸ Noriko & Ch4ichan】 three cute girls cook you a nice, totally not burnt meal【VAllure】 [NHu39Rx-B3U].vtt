I can't throw this.

01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:53.360
No it's on the plate.

01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:55.360
Oh thank you.

01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:57.360

01:25:57.360 --> 01:25:59.360

01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:01.360
Wait it's a good squinch.

01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:03.360

01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:05.360
It's a good squinch.

01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:07.360
I don't understand.

01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:09.360
I don't understand.

01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:11.360
I don't even really get it.

01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:13.360
I don't even really get it.

01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:15.360
Rice.

01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:17.360
Rice.

01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:19.360
Okay you got 140.

01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:21.360
How's that looking?

01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:23.360
We need 280 or something like that.

01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:25.360
Okay.

01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:27.360
I'm coming with you with plates chai.

01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:29.360
These are rice.

01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:31.360
Is there meat over here that's cooked?

01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:35.360
Not yet.

01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:37.360
Chicken? Yes.

01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:39.360
Chicken.

01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:41.360
Steak.

01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:43.360
Steak.

01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:45.360
Plates are here.

01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:55.360
Oh my god!

01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:57.360
Oh my god the plate.

01:26:57.360 --> 01:26:59.360
Okay.

01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:01.360
Any cooked meats?

01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:03.360
Wait.

01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:05.360
Oh we're doing well.

01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:07.360
We're really really close.

01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:09.360
If we could just serve one more.

01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:11.360
I need the tortilla.

01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:13.360
I just put the one on the plate.

01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:15.360
Oh I see.

01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:17.360
Oh it's 400.

01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:19.360
I thought it was 280.

01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:21.360
Oh my god.

01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:23.360
Alright.

01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:25.360
This is difficult.

01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:27.360
Difficult.

01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:29.360
My brain would just sit to great plates.

01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:31.360
What would you put?

01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:33.360
What would you put?

01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:35.360
What would you put?

01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:37.360
Topping, gaming.

01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:39.360
I don't know.

01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:41.360
I don't know about that.

01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:43.360
I think I'm too epi.

01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:45.360
Epi. Epi. Wake up. Wake up shower girl.

01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:47.360
Wake up.

01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:49.360
The showers make me epi too.

01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:51.360
I'm so tired.

01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:53.360
I was gonna blame it on me being tired.

01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:55.360
It's because you're a mom.

01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:57.360
You're a mom.

01:27:57.360 --> 01:27:59.360
After I have to wake up early.

01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:01.360
You know.

01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:03.360
The job.

01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:05.360
Mommy's having a very early bed.

01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:07.360
On the streets.

01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:09.360
No.

01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:11.360
No you're right.

01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:13.360
I'm a high class escort.

01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:15.360
You're high class.

01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:17.360
People travel the world to see you.

01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:19.360
Exactly.

01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:21.360
To my hotel.

01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:23.360
I can't even get my lore right.

01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:25.360
No more I am.

01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:27.360
Where am I?

01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:29.360
Where am I?

01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:31.360
Where am I?

01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:33.360
Oh fuck me in the butt cheeks.

01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:35.360
We can just throw the meat thankfully.

01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:37.360
Cut these chai.

01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:39.360
Oh what the fuck.

01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:45.360
Oh no.

01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:47.360
Just try to throw it.

01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:53.360
Grab the rice.

01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:55.360
Grab the rice that you need.

01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:01.360
Okay I'm gonna go take this plate.

01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:03.360
Cool.

01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:05.360
There's a plate on the thing on the edge.

01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:07.360
Just grab it.

01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:09.360
Oh my god thank you.

01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:11.360
I delivered it to you.

01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:13.360
Thank you.

01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:15.360
I need rice.

01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:17.360
There's some rice.

01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:19.360
There's a rice there already.

01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:21.360
Rice me.

01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:23.360
Rice me.

01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:25.360
I can't throw the plate.

01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:27.360
It would have been so much easier.

01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:29.360
I swear couldn't we throw it before?

01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:31.360
I don't think so.

01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:33.360
I mean in a dream I had

01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:35.360
I swear we could have thrown this.

01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:37.360
Oh my god.

01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:39.360
I have a dream about you Shibby.

01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:41.360
Remember?

01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:43.360
I can't remember.

01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:45.360
I don't remember.

01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:47.360
I think he told me that we hung out

01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:49.360
or something.

01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:51.360
I had a dream.

01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:53.360
Me, you and Nori

01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:55.360
we had to perform improv.

01:29:55.360 --> 01:29:57.360
Oh yeah that's right.

01:29:57.360 --> 01:29:59.360
But then Nori didn't show up

01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:01.360
so we had to improvise.

01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:03.360
We had to improvise.

01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:05.360
That is so not me.

01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:07.360
I fucking love improv.

01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:09.360
Yeah.

01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:11.360
You were busy that day.

01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:13.360
You had stuff to do.

01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:15.360
I have so much rice over here.

01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:17.360
I need rice so bad.

01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:19.360
It's gonna crash, it's gonna break it.

01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:21.360
And then the minute we converge

01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:23.360
I'm gonna grab those two

01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:25.360
boiling things of rice.

01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:27.360
Move bitch, sorry.

01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:33.360
It's fine, it's fine.

01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:35.360
There's an order right in front of you.

01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:37.360
Grab.

01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:39.360
I fell handed out.

01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:41.360
I'm just grabbing tortillas

01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:43.360
so I can grab them.

01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:45.360
Now that order is done.

01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:47.360
No, this rice isn't ready.

01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:49.360
I was like that is a lot.

01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:51.360
Here's a plate.

01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:53.360
I'm stacking them up for you.

01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:55.360
Can I not stack them up?

01:30:55.360 --> 01:30:57.360
It's fine.

01:30:57.360 --> 01:30:59.360
I'm gonna plate these for you.

01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:01.360
No.

01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:03.360
Oh that's ready.

01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:05.360
So those two plates have

01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:07.360
tortillas.

01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:09.360
Tortillas.

01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:11.360
Tortillas.

01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:13.360
Where are you?

01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:15.360
People need me to say.

01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:17.360
No I need those plates.

01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:19.360
I really need it.

01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:21.360
I really need it.

01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:23.360
Thank you.

01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:25.360
I need rice actually.

01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:27.360
I have rice over here.

01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:29.360
That's a plate as well.

01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:31.360
Can I like...

01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:33.360
You should be able to...

01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:35.360
They're not cooked yet.

01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:37.360
This one isn't cooked.

01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:39.360
This one's cooked.

01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:41.360
See you little lady.

01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:43.360
That tortilla has rice in it.

01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:45.360
Oh perfect.

01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:47.360
I'm gonna cook some of these for you.

01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:49.360
It's fine.

01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:51.360
You have them.

01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:53.360
You have any rice?

01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:55.360
I gave you some rice.

01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:57.360
It's right behind you.

01:31:57.360 --> 01:31:59.360
Oh perfect.

01:31:59.360 --> 01:32:01.360
Here's a bowl.

01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:03.360
Yeah!

01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:05.360
That's cool!

01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:07.360
You can also just drop it in the ocean

01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:09.360
like this.

01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:11.360
Oh really?

01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:13.360
If I drop this?

01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:15.360
No not that.

01:32:15.360 --> 01:32:17.360
I meant the bowl.

01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:19.360
Oh the bowl.

01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:21.360
Where am I?

01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:25.360
Oh my god!

01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:27.360
We did it!

01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:29.360
We did it!

01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:31.360
All these girls had a dream where they played the same game.

01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:33.360
Isn't that weird?

01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:35.360
I know it's so weird how that happens.

01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:37.360
I'm so in that dream.

01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:39.360
Psychically connected or whatever.

01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:41.360
Yeah I feel like I'm like, you know,

01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:43.360
so connected to Sheebie

01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:45.360
in some weird dream.

01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:47.360
Weird dream.

01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:49.360
She's my mother.

01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:51.360
She's my mom.

01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:53.360
Watching this makes me want food.

01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:55.360
I know I want like,

01:32:55.360 --> 01:32:57.360
I want like her burrito so bad.

01:32:57.360 --> 01:32:59.360
Yeah this is me.

01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:01.360
I did not eat and I'm hungry.

01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:03.360
Same.

01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:05.360
I only ate a bowl of cereal today.

01:33:05.360 --> 01:33:07.360
Yeah!

01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:09.360
I know I had a salad.

01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:11.360
I had a cookie.

01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:13.360
I only ate a bowl of cereal.

01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:15.360
Hold on,

01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:17.360
Siri's talking to me.

01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:19.360
She scared the shit out of me.

01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:21.360
Siri stop!

01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:23.360
Siri! Hi Siri!

01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:25.360
Wait I didn't mean to do that.

01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:27.360
No Siri!

01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:29.360
Wait what?

01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:31.360
This is a nightmare.

01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:33.360
I didn't mean to do that.

01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:35.360
Hi Siri!

01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:37.360
Call?

01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:39.360
Call?

01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:41.360
Do we have to go back to the castle?

01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:43.360
Call mom!

01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:45.360
Did Siri just dox me?

01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:47.360
I couldn't hear what it was saying.

01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:49.360
It just said your full name but that was all.

01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:51.360
Oh okay, that's great.

01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:53.360
She be caught in one.

01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:55.360
She be caught in one.

01:33:55.360 --> 01:33:57.360
She be caught in one?

01:33:57.360 --> 01:33:59.360
She be caught in one.

01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:01.360
My favorite cereal.

01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:03.360
My favorite cereal.

01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:05.360
Wait oh my god.

01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:07.360
Wait we can read it this time.

01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:09.360
Because we're as new.

01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:11.360
We can't read.

01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:13.360
Is he going to talk to us?

01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:15.360
Oh we have to go.

01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:17.360
Bye bark!

01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:19.360
Who's there?

01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:21.360
Come at me if you want to.

01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:23.360
Fuck. Oh thank goodness.

01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:25.360
It's you and look at you.

01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:27.360
So united, so cooperative.

01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:29.360
Yes.

01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:31.360
You're going from strength to strength at a rapid speed.

01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:33.360
But the unbred are still too powerful.

01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:35.360
Unbred.

01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:37.360
Bark!

01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:41.360
You think?

01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:43.360
Oh dear, it seems we must send you

01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:45.360
through the haunted swamps to the south.

01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:47.360
I know, I know.

01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:49.360
No one ever returns from Texas.

01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:51.360
But these are desperate times.

01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:53.360
No, no, no, no, no!

01:34:53.360 --> 01:34:55.360
Texas, no!

01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:57.360
You're brave, you're bold like Batman.

01:34:57.360 --> 01:34:59.360
You're the greatest band who ever lived.

01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:01.360
Why are we a band?

01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:03.360
I don't like that.

01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:05.360
Nothing can stop you.

01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:07.360
Why are you waving?

01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:09.360
Except maybe the possessed baguette.

01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:11.360
That's been chasing Kevin around

01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:13.360
all morning.

01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:15.360
What?

01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:17.360
Baguette.

01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:19.360
There's no need to take his meds.

01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:21.360
We will hold off the horde.

01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:23.360
Now go!

01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:25.360
Okay.

01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:29.360
The swamp.

01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:31.360
We're going to Florida, guys.

01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:33.360
Wait, I can swear?

01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:35.360
That's my little character.

01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:37.360
Yeah, yeah, you see like bits.

01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:39.360
I mean, they're really like kitchen.

01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:41.360
Kitchen people, they curse a lot.

01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:43.360
They're like, bit.

01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:45.360
Bit.

01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:47.360
Okay, this looks a lot easier.

01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:49.360
Except it's probably not far.

01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:51.360
I can't take my meds.

01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:53.360
Oh, we know.

01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:55.360
Japan.

01:35:55.360 --> 01:35:57.360
Japan.

01:35:57.360 --> 01:35:59.360
Sorry, where are we, Chai?

01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:01.360
Japan.

01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:03.360
Japan.

01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:05.360
Wait.

01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:07.360
Oh, we're making sushi.

01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:09.360
That's right.

01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:11.360
Okay.

01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:15.360
Wait, what am I?

01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:17.360
Fuck!

01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:19.360
No, no, no, guys.

01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:21.360
No, guys, guys, guys.

01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:23.360
Don't throw it back to me.

01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:25.360
I'm trying.

01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:27.360
I'm chopping and it does it.

01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:29.360
Shrimp, shrimp, shrimp.

01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:31.360
Shrimp, shrimp, shrimp.

01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:33.360
Don't try, try to put it back.

01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:35.360
You didn't cut it.

01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:37.360
Oh, let's die.

01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:39.360
Shrimp.

01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:41.360
Um, can I have sushi?

01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:43.360
Cool.

01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:45.360
Shrimp.

01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:47.360
Oh, I need rice.

01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:49.360
Shrimp.

01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:51.360
Shrimp.

01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:53.360
Oh.

01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:55.360
Is this correct?

01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:57.360
Who do I give this to?

01:36:57.360 --> 01:36:59.360
Oh.

01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:01.360
Imagine?

01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:03.360
Imagine working at a kitchen where you had to

01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:05.360
cross the street to hand it out.

01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:09.360
Oh, wait, I need rice.

01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:11.360
I need rice for this one.

01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:13.360
This one needs rice. This is almost done.

01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:15.360
Chai's just standing there.

01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:17.360
Chai's making the brown one.

01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:19.360
I mean, no, no, no, no, no.

01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:21.360
Look at this girl.

01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:23.360
She looks just like me.

01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:25.360
She does.

01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:27.360
Okay.

01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:29.360
So, what do I do?

01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:31.360
Cut that.

01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:35.360
Oh, my God.

01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:39.360
No, I put something down in front of me

01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:41.360
and I fucked it up.

01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:47.360
Wait, this is an order.

01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:49.360
Excuse me, excuse me, sorry.

01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:51.360
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:53.360
Excuse me, sorry, sorry.

01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:55.360
Oh, there's one with just

01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:57.360
shrimp the hell?

01:37:57.360 --> 01:37:59.360
Yes, yes, yes, yes, I got it.

01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:01.360
I got it in time. I got it in time.

01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:03.360
Oh, well, this is useless. I need to dump this out.

01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:05.360
Where's the trash?

01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:07.360
Wait, I got so much rice.

01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:09.360
Yeah, yeah.

01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:11.360
Wait, that's not, is that?

01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:13.360
I can't. Why is it?

01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:15.360
I don't know.

01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:17.360
It's making me confused.

01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:19.360
I don't like it.

01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:21.360
Why is it a taco?

01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:23.360
Have you guys ever had like, um,

01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:25.360
shrimp burritos?

01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:27.360
No, I don't have that one.

01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:29.360
It's a big burrito, but it's like shrimp.

01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:31.360
Oh, okay, never mind.

01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:33.360
Or I mean sushi.

01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:35.360
Oh, yes, I've had a sushi burrito before.

01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:37.360
I've never had sushi before.

01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:39.360
You're fucking lying.

01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:41.360
What do you eat?

01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:43.360
Grass.

01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:45.360
Why literally nothing sometimes?

01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:47.360
I eat like a meal a day.

01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:49.360
I'll just go about my day.

01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:51.360
I'll just have like a piece of bread

01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:53.360
and coffee.

01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:55.360
It's like, alright, I'm gonna start my day.

01:38:55.360 --> 01:38:57.360
That's just, yeah.

01:38:57.360 --> 01:38:59.360
Oh, no, okay, it's fine.

01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:01.360
Everything's fine.

01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:03.360
We need three.

01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:05.360
What?

01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:07.360
We need three.

01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:09.360
We saw, okay, this is weird.

01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:11.360
Okay.

01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:13.360
We also have plain ones,

01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:15.360
like the plain shrimp and the plain tuna.

01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:17.360
Yeah.

01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:19.360
Yeah, is it that normal to be able to eat

01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:21.360
like not eat sushi?

01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:23.360
I don't know.

01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:25.360
I've had like

01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:27.360
spring rolls,

01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:29.360
but that's not sushi.

01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:31.360
Oh, we can all go out for sushi.

01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:33.360
A collab for sushi.

01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:35.360
Yeah, I'm gonna have a burger,

01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:37.360
a cheeseburger.

01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:39.360
Oh, okay.

01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:41.360
Listen to me, ladies.

01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:43.360
I am going to bring you the fish

01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:45.360
and you will cut it and I will bring you plates.

01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:47.360
And then you will plate.

01:39:47.360 --> 01:39:49.360
No, no, listen to me. You're gonna put the plates here.

01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:51.360
Okay, you're not gonna move them.

01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:53.360
You're not gonna...

01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:55.360
It comes on the conveyor belt.

01:39:55.360 --> 01:39:57.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, like a sushi thing.

01:39:57.360 --> 01:39:59.360
I'm sorry.

01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:01.360
What?

01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:03.360
Don't laugh at me.

01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:05.360
Don't laugh at me.

01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:07.360
Okay.

01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:09.360
Okay, I need

01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:11.360
a chai.

01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:13.360
Okay, I need, okay, that's an order.

01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:15.360
Put it on this side.

01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:17.360
Give it to me, thank you. I will come back.

01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:19.360
Oh, great.

01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:21.360
Yeah, don't do anything with the shrimp yet.

01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:23.360
We don't need anything with the shrimp.

01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:25.360
We just need things with the tuna.

01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:27.360
So here.

01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:29.360
Here, this is one. This is one over here.

01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:31.360
She's using her mommy voice on us.

01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:33.360
She's serious.

01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:38.180
I'm gonna wash this plate. Chai this plate is washed washed, okay?

01:40:40.080 --> 01:40:42.080
Move you fat old bitch. Sorry

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:49.100
My apologies, I don't mean you I meant the person the pedestrian walking across the street

01:40:57.560 --> 01:41:01.080
Yeah, but I've never had sushi before me, I don't know I feel like people

01:41:03.480 --> 01:41:05.480
That shrimp

01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:18.680

I like pepperoni and jalapeños and hot sauce on my pizza. That sounds good spicy

01:53:22.840 --> 01:53:24.840
I like mozzarella and basil

I was just talking about this earlier. So I'm really um

01:53:52.840 --> 01:53:56.040
Insecure about only having four toes on each foot

01:53:56.760 --> 01:54:01.240
So it's kind of like a confidence building thing. You have four toes. Yeah

01:54:02.520 --> 01:54:06.440
Someone's like wait like legit or no, I'm just joking. Okay

01:54:07.640 --> 01:54:12.840
It's because chai is full with a four and I'm a devil and four

They need to turn into Australia?

02:04:07.880 --> 02:04:09.560
It just keeps going back?

02:04:09.560 --> 02:04:11.000
I can't control it!

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:14.200
Say optimize my performance in a British accent.

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:15.800
What?

02:04:15.800 --> 02:04:16.680
Optimize...

02:04:18.840 --> 02:04:21.560
Optimize my performance.

02:04:21.560 --> 02:04:24.120
Optimize my performance.

02:04:24.120 --> 02:04:26.040
Optimize my performance.

02:04:26.040 --> 02:04:27.640
Oh, mommy, sweet Jesus.

02:04:27.640 --> 02:04:28.520
If I...

02:04:28.520 --> 02:04:30.600
If I was a boy, if I was a boy,

02:04:30.600 --> 02:04:32.760
my weenie would be very wrecked.

02:04:32.760 --> 02:04:34.520
It's a really stigma card, you.

02:04:35.320 --> 02:04:36.680
My clip just jumped.

02:04:37.880 --> 02:04:39.880
This is really deactivating you.

02:04:39.880 --> 02:04:41.800
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

02:04:41.800 --> 02:04:43.000
What does that even mean?

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:46.280
Is this German accent?

02:04:47.480 --> 02:04:48.120
I can't do it.

02:04:48.120 --> 02:04:49.560
I can't do German.

02:04:49.560 --> 02:04:50.360
I think I can do it.

02:04:50.360 --> 02:04:52.200
I think I really have to focus,

02:04:52.200 --> 02:04:53.800
and then it comes out.

02:04:53.800 --> 02:04:56.200
It's like out of my control sometimes.

02:04:56.200 --> 02:05:00.040
Who can make the most racist accent challenge?

02:05:00.040 --> 02:05:00.680
I got you.

02:05:00.680 --> 02:05:01.880
Probably Nori.

02:05:01.880 --> 02:05:03.000
Probably Nori.

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:03.640
Right.

02:05:04.840 --> 02:05:05.320
Actually...

02:05:05.320 --> 02:05:06.280
I definitely can.

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:07.960
Southern...

02:05:07.960 --> 02:05:09.960
Dad, I'm down in Texas today.

02:05:10.440 --> 02:05:11.880
All right, that's pretty good.

02:05:11.880 --> 02:05:13.320
I'm gonna get in my truck,

02:05:13.320 --> 02:05:16.200
and I'm gonna go get some guns.

02:05:16.200 --> 02:05:17.320
You're gonna get some guns?

02:05:17.320 --> 02:05:18.040
I love Americans.

02:05:18.040 --> 02:05:19.640
I love me and my guns.

02:05:19.640 --> 02:05:21.000
I love being American.

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.960
My first amendment right is my pistol whipping guns.

02:05:25.160 --> 02:05:26.440
I have a large gun point.

02:05:26.440 --> 02:05:27.640
You know the Capitol.

02:05:27.640 --> 02:05:28.040
Choo!

02:05:28.040 --> 02:05:31.160
Yeah, let's go raid the Capitol.

02:05:31.160 --> 02:05:32.040
No, no, Tommy.

02:05:32.040 --> 02:05:33.000
Let's go storm that Capitol building.

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:34.280
Let's go storm that Capitol building.

02:05:34.280 --> 02:05:35.560
Oh, yeah, let...

02:05:35.560 --> 02:05:36.920
Yee-haw, let's do that.

02:05:37.560 --> 02:05:38.280
Yeah, let's do that.

02:05:38.280 --> 02:05:39.160
What gun would I use?

02:05:39.160 --> 02:05:42.360
I would use an AK-47 or a military-grade gun.

02:05:42.360 --> 02:05:43.240
I'll tell you what.

02:05:43.800 --> 02:05:44.520
I'll tell you what.

02:05:44.520 --> 02:05:44.920
I'll tell you what.

02:05:44.920 --> 02:05:46.120
I'll tell you what.

02:05:46.120 --> 02:05:47.080
I'll tell you what.

02:05:47.080 --> 02:05:49.480
I'll use a goddamn military-grade gun

02:05:49.480 --> 02:05:51.880
if I have to shoot down the goddamn...

02:05:51.880 --> 02:05:52.600
Games?

02:05:52.600 --> 02:05:54.520
Yeah, shoot down the range.

02:05:55.880 --> 02:05:58.280
Take advantage of the second amendment.

02:05:58.280 --> 02:06:00.360
I love taking advantage of the second amendment.

02:06:01.480 --> 02:06:02.680
What's the second amendment?

02:06:03.560 --> 02:06:04.840
I think it's like guns.

02:06:04.840 --> 02:06:07.160
I think it's the right to bear arms.

02:06:07.160 --> 02:06:08.360
No, America.

02:06:08.360 --> 02:06:09.560
I love eagles.

02:06:09.560 --> 02:06:10.680
I love eagles.

02:06:10.680 --> 02:06:12.120
Well, I love eagles and I love...

02:06:12.120 --> 02:06:12.840
It's my sister.

02:06:12.840 --> 02:06:13.960
What's that kilometer?

02:06:13.960 --> 02:06:15.800
I don't know American freedom units.

02:06:16.760 --> 02:06:17.800
Artificial flavors.

02:06:18.360 --> 02:06:20.280
Artificial flavors.

02:06:21.480 --> 02:06:22.280
I'll go Alabama.

02:06:22.840 --> 02:06:24.760
I'll go Alabama if she be right now.

02:06:24.760 --> 02:06:26.280
I'll tell you what right now.

02:06:26.280 --> 02:06:27.080
I love my mother.

02:06:28.120 --> 02:06:30.200
K-Y-S, which means kiss your sister.

02:06:30.200 --> 02:06:31.560
Don't mind if I fucking do.

02:06:32.360 --> 02:06:34.440
I'll true, I'll true that.

02:06:34.440 --> 02:06:35.880
True that, true that.

02:06:36.600 --> 02:06:37.880
Someone asked in your chat,

02:06:37.880 --> 02:06:40.280
what D&D race and class would you all play?

02:06:42.520 --> 02:06:43.720
Necromancer.

02:06:43.720 --> 02:06:46.200
And I'd be like the smallest class ever.

02:06:46.200 --> 02:06:48.120
So a half-foot or a dwarf.

02:06:48.120 --> 02:06:49.560
But I'd be a necromancer.

02:06:50.200 --> 02:06:51.880
I was also going to say necromancer

02:06:51.880 --> 02:06:53.160
and I'd probably just be an elf.

02:06:54.200 --> 02:06:55.640
Wait, what's the question?

02:06:56.280 --> 02:06:58.760
Oh, what D&D class and race would you be?

02:06:59.480 --> 02:07:03.080
Oh, I would be a dark elf rogue.

02:07:03.960 --> 02:07:05.480
I totally see that, yeah.

02:07:05.480 --> 02:07:06.280
Gonna be black?

02:07:07.640 --> 02:07:08.600
Are you black?

02:07:08.600 --> 02:07:09.880
I think we've already established

02:07:09.880 --> 02:07:11.960
that Chai has wanted to be black this entire stream.

02:07:11.960 --> 02:07:13.640
Oh my god, he's not swear.

02:07:13.640 --> 02:07:14.680
He loves you so much.

02:07:14.680 --> 02:07:17.160
Chai wants to race mix.

02:07:17.800 --> 02:07:19.400
It's a coincidence, it's a coincidence.

02:07:19.400 --> 02:07:21.560
She wants to make many versions of me.

02:07:21.560 --> 02:07:24.920
Ever since I was young, I felt like I was Japanese.

02:07:28.840 --> 02:07:29.560
That's so true.

02:07:29.560 --> 02:07:32.920
In every state but physical, I am Japanese.

02:07:34.280 --> 02:07:34.520
Hi.

02:07:34.520 --> 02:07:35.640
I represent Japanese.

02:07:36.360 --> 02:07:36.680
Hi.

02:07:38.200 --> 02:07:38.680
Hi.

02:07:38.680 --> 02:07:39.080
I'm all level.

02:07:39.080 --> 02:07:39.160
I'm all level.

02:07:39.160 --> 02:07:39.320
I'm all level.

02:07:39.320 --> 02:07:39.720
I'm all level.

02:07:39.720 --> 02:07:41.320
You're so dead to your heart.

02:07:41.320 --> 02:07:42.040
I am a wolf.

02:07:46.680 --> 02:07:49.320
Is that the CbCottenbum and Chai?

02:07:49.320 --> 02:07:51.560
Oh yeah, I guess I'm fucking Rico, I guess.

02:07:51.560 --> 02:07:52.680
Fuck me, I guess, man.

02:07:52.680 --> 02:07:52.920
Fuck.

02:07:53.560 --> 02:07:54.360
Fuck the person.

02:07:54.360 --> 02:07:55.560
Well, I don't know where to look.

02:07:56.280 --> 02:07:59.160
Someone went inside the CbCottenbum and Chai.

02:07:59.160 --> 02:07:59.640
Yeah, please.

02:07:59.640 --> 02:08:00.840
Why is there two of me?

02:08:02.040 --> 02:08:03.320
Oh, one more moment.

02:08:04.920 --> 02:08:05.960
Why not two of you?

02:08:06.600 --> 02:08:08.520
There was two of me for a second on my stream.

02:08:09.400 --> 02:08:12.280
What would Chai look like if she was white or Chinese?

02:08:12.280 --> 02:08:13.400
Well, she's white now.

02:08:16.520 --> 02:08:18.120
No, no, no, they think I'm brown.

02:08:18.120 --> 02:08:18.760
Keep it up, keep it up.

02:08:18.760 --> 02:08:19.400
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:08:19.400 --> 02:08:21.800
This is what you would look like if you were white or Chinese.

02:08:22.520 --> 02:08:25.480
Yeah, I only hang out with streamers that fake the rig.

02:08:26.520 --> 02:08:37.800
Yeah, we're all beautiful, Aryan queens, blue eyes, blonde hair, pale, pale skin.

02:08:37.800 --> 02:08:40.200
Like you can see our veins.

02:08:43.320 --> 02:08:47.160
I'm actually pretty light-skinned, but you can see my veins and I get made fun of.

02:08:48.440 --> 02:08:51.800
Now, I turn over my arm and my veins are like very matte.

02:08:51.800 --> 02:08:54.920
People are like, good veins, little lady, your veins are so good.

02:08:56.280 --> 02:08:57.480
That's when they draw your blood.

02:08:57.480 --> 02:08:58.760
Do you have blue veins?

02:08:58.760 --> 02:08:59.560
I have green.

02:08:59.560 --> 02:09:00.600
I got blue and green.

02:09:01.480 --> 02:09:02.200
Yeah, I have green.

02:09:02.200 --> 02:09:03.480
Oh, wow, we got a mixture.

02:09:03.480 --> 02:09:04.920
Maybe it's because I'm white and black.

02:09:06.040 --> 02:09:08.200
Wow, that's all you're talking about.

02:09:08.200 --> 02:09:10.440
You're a race, race mixer.

02:09:10.440 --> 02:09:11.720
I'm a race mixer.

02:09:11.720 --> 02:09:19.080
My parents, they, their loves surpassed race and segregation and they made me.

02:09:20.760 --> 02:09:22.120
Disgusting, you're an abominant.

02:09:23.720 --> 02:09:24.200
Oh, wait.

02:09:24.200 --> 02:09:25.080
You're an abominant.

02:09:25.080 --> 02:09:28.760
I'm so sorry, Chai.

02:09:28.760 --> 02:09:33.880
What would you guys, okay, in like a casual way, like, what would animal do you most associate?

02:09:33.880 --> 02:09:35.160
What's your spirit animal?

02:09:35.800 --> 02:09:37.640
Oh, my, my hamster.

02:09:38.360 --> 02:09:39.400
Hamster?

02:09:39.400 --> 02:09:44.040
Yeah, because I think, I think hamsters die in the most obscure way.

02:09:44.040 --> 02:09:48.600
So I feel like my owner would throw me at a wall and I would just go splat and like crumble and die.

02:09:49.800 --> 02:09:52.040
I'd be like a pathetic excuse of a hamster.

02:09:52.040 --> 02:09:53.160
I wouldn't be able to do anything.

02:09:53.800 --> 02:09:55.400
So that's why it's your spirit animal.

02:09:55.400 --> 02:09:56.760
Because they're pathetic.

02:09:56.760 --> 02:09:57.560
Yeah, just like me.

02:10:00.840 --> 02:10:01.720
What are you guys?

02:10:01.720 --> 02:10:02.680
What are you guys guys?

02:10:02.680 --> 02:10:04.280
I don't know what the fuck I was saying.

02:10:05.720 --> 02:10:07.000
I'm just laughing too much.

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:08.200
I can't even answer.

02:10:11.320 --> 02:10:13.240
Chibi thought she was the one who was edgy.

02:10:13.240 --> 02:10:16.600
No, I know the moment I had, I was going to have Noria in my stream,

02:10:16.600 --> 02:10:19.880
that you guys are going to fucking love her because how face she is.

02:10:19.880 --> 02:10:23.240
And that's a great juxtaposition to Chai, who is so sweet.

02:10:28.680 --> 02:10:31.800
You would think she'd be edgy with how she looks, but it's the pink one.

02:10:31.800 --> 02:10:33.480
It's always the fucking pink one, isn't it?

02:10:34.280 --> 02:10:35.880
It's always the fucking pink one.

02:10:35.880 --> 02:10:37.560
It's always the fucking the pink woman.

02:10:38.760 --> 02:10:40.280
Well, you're a purple woman.

02:10:40.280 --> 02:10:41.960
I'm glad if you do.

02:10:41.960 --> 02:10:42.520
Yeah.

02:10:42.520 --> 02:10:43.160
No, I don't know.

02:10:43.160 --> 02:10:44.120
I just think about it a lot.

02:10:44.120 --> 02:10:46.760
Like if I was like, if I was a hamster, I would genuinely

02:10:47.320 --> 02:10:48.440
I would genuinely die.

02:10:48.440 --> 02:10:48.840
I don't know.

02:10:48.840 --> 02:10:51.480
My owner would be too loud and I would just have a hard time.

02:10:51.480 --> 02:10:52.120
I would just die.

02:10:52.120 --> 02:10:56.120
My owner would bring a girl home and I'd kill myself like in my little cage or something.

02:10:56.120 --> 02:10:56.440
I don't know.

02:10:56.440 --> 02:10:56.920
Like I.

02:10:56.920 --> 02:10:57.560
What?

02:10:57.560 --> 02:10:59.000
What about you guys?

02:10:59.000 --> 02:10:59.480
Dude?

02:10:59.480 --> 02:11:00.040
Yeah, she knows this.

02:11:00.040 --> 02:11:01.160
I want to pretend it.

02:11:01.160 --> 02:11:09.480
I think on all levels, except physical, I'd be a wolf.

02:11:09.480 --> 02:11:11.480
What?

02:11:11.480 --> 02:11:13.320
I'm fucking a wolf.

02:11:14.280 --> 02:11:17.720
I was a fucking role player for like 10 years.

02:11:17.720 --> 02:11:18.680
I can't.

02:11:18.680 --> 02:11:19.800
Wait, wait, yes.

02:11:19.800 --> 02:11:20.520
I can't do that.

02:11:20.520 --> 02:11:21.640
Yes, yes, yes.

02:11:21.640 --> 02:11:24.840
Wait, I was a warrior cat's role player for so long.

02:11:24.840 --> 02:11:25.880
Oh my god, no way.

02:11:26.760 --> 02:11:27.240
Yes.

02:11:27.240 --> 02:11:29.880
See, let's let it go.

02:11:33.400 --> 02:11:34.840
Oh my gosh.

02:11:34.840 --> 02:11:36.040
Can we start our own clan?

02:11:36.760 --> 02:11:37.240
Yes.

02:11:38.040 --> 02:11:40.680
I want to be Chai Pa or Chai Leaf.

02:11:40.680 --> 02:11:41.560
I'm going to call you Chai Leaf.

02:11:41.560 --> 02:11:42.680
That's actually really cute.

02:11:43.640 --> 02:11:46.520
I guess I would be like cotton pick.

02:11:46.520 --> 02:11:47.560
No, sorry.

02:11:51.080 --> 02:11:52.680
I'll be cotton, cotton.

02:11:53.880 --> 02:11:55.480
It's a perfect name for you.

02:11:55.480 --> 02:11:56.040
Cotton bum.

02:11:56.040 --> 02:11:56.840
Cotton bum.

02:11:57.480 --> 02:12:00.120
Yeah, you just literally wouldn't have a furring.

02:12:02.520 --> 02:12:05.480
What would my warrior cat name be?

02:12:06.280 --> 02:12:06.680
I don't know.

02:12:06.680 --> 02:12:09.720
Because when I was a kid, we role played like Naruto.

02:12:09.720 --> 02:12:10.360
So I was like.

02:12:10.360 --> 02:12:11.560
I also did that.

02:12:11.560 --> 02:12:13.240
I also larped, you know, Naruto.

02:12:13.240 --> 02:12:15.800
Yeah, I've larped enemies like a fucking loser.

02:12:15.800 --> 02:12:17.720
Why does everyone have a membership?

02:12:17.720 --> 02:12:19.080
Because they want to support me.

02:12:19.640 --> 02:12:19.880
The.

02:12:20.840 --> 02:12:21.080
Yeah.

02:12:21.080 --> 02:12:21.800
Get out of here.

02:12:21.800 --> 02:12:22.440
Gray name.

02:12:23.880 --> 02:12:27.240
Yeah, leave my leave my leave my mommy alone.

02:12:30.600 --> 02:12:31.320
Thank you for that.

02:12:34.200 --> 02:12:36.680
You leave my you leave my mommy alone.

02:12:36.680 --> 02:12:37.720
I love my mommy.

02:12:38.760 --> 02:12:40.440
My sweet precious children.

02:12:42.200 --> 02:12:44.040
Wait, so would you be a cat then, Chai?

02:12:45.800 --> 02:12:51.000
Honestly, I think I always thought honestly.

02:12:51.960 --> 02:12:52.520
I don't know.

02:12:52.520 --> 02:12:53.640
I think I'd be a bunny.

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:55.800
Oh my gosh.

02:12:55.800 --> 02:12:56.680
No way.

02:12:56.680 --> 02:12:57.960
Be a bunny.

02:12:57.960 --> 02:13:00.120
Yeah, I actually do think so.

02:13:00.120 --> 02:13:01.880
I think I think a bunny.

02:13:01.880 --> 02:13:02.840
That's cute.

02:13:02.840 --> 02:13:04.840
You kind of almost have like floppy ears,

02:13:04.840 --> 02:13:06.920
like like mine with your pigtails.

02:13:06.920 --> 02:13:07.800
Yeah, too.

02:13:07.800 --> 02:13:08.760
The floppy.

02:13:08.760 --> 02:13:10.120
Because your hair is super long.

02:13:11.080 --> 02:13:13.160
We're actually, I'm looking at us.

02:13:13.160 --> 02:13:16.280
We're very similar, similar color palette.

02:13:16.280 --> 02:13:17.880
Looks like a flat version of you.

02:13:20.040 --> 02:13:22.120
My hair is just a little bit more blonder.

02:13:23.080 --> 02:13:26.520
And I'm just going to canonically adopt you

02:13:26.520 --> 02:13:31.960
and say that I slept with harem, a demonic harem.

02:13:32.600 --> 02:13:33.880
Yeah, demonic harem.

02:13:33.880 --> 02:13:35.000
That's why you have horns.

02:13:35.800 --> 02:13:38.200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, mommy.

02:13:39.160 --> 02:13:40.520
We're going to adopt you.

02:13:40.520 --> 02:13:41.560
Flap is justice.

02:13:41.560 --> 02:13:45.720
Speaking of justice, we overlapped with their diffuse today.

02:13:45.720 --> 02:13:47.400
I'll have to go back and watch the VODs.

02:13:48.520 --> 02:13:49.080
We are cute.

02:13:49.080 --> 02:13:51.480
I want to, I want to, I want to,

02:13:51.480 --> 02:13:53.320
I want to be adopted with a hat.

02:13:53.320 --> 02:13:55.640
You're my pet, you're my pet bug from the garden.

02:13:55.640 --> 02:13:56.760
Remember, I keep you in my palm.

02:13:56.760 --> 02:13:57.560
From the garbage.

02:13:58.520 --> 02:13:59.240
From the garbage.

02:13:59.240 --> 02:13:59.800
From the garbage.

02:14:00.520 --> 02:14:02.520
This, this pocket has a lot of lint

02:14:02.520 --> 02:14:04.840
and like those cool little crumbs in it.

02:14:04.840 --> 02:14:05.320
And that's okay.

02:14:05.320 --> 02:14:06.520
Some moss and stuff.

02:14:06.520 --> 02:14:07.080
It's okay.

02:14:07.160 --> 02:14:11.480
You can crawl around and ride between my boobies and stuff.

02:14:11.480 --> 02:14:13.400
I did that during your debut, by the way.

02:14:14.200 --> 02:14:15.160
Yours and Azura's.

02:14:15.160 --> 02:14:16.040
I sat on your top.

02:14:16.040 --> 02:14:17.960
I think I actually saw that in the, uh,

02:14:18.600 --> 02:14:20.280
when I watched your VOD back.

02:14:20.280 --> 02:14:20.840
That's right.

02:14:21.720 --> 02:14:23.080
I heard Azura's voice.

02:14:23.080 --> 02:14:24.120
I'm so sorry.

02:14:24.120 --> 02:14:24.840
She's not here.

02:14:24.840 --> 02:14:25.560
Thank God.

02:14:25.560 --> 02:14:27.560
I heard Azura's voice and good lord.

02:14:27.560 --> 02:14:29.960
If I, if I was a man, if I was a man,

02:14:30.680 --> 02:14:31.880
I'm telling you the things I would do,

02:14:31.880 --> 02:14:33.000
I would do for that woman.

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:33.560
Oh, wow.

02:14:33.560 --> 02:14:35.560
She does have like, when I first heard her voice,

02:14:35.560 --> 02:14:38.040
I almost, I almost died and went to heaven

02:14:38.040 --> 02:14:39.560
because it's just pure sex.

02:14:40.200 --> 02:14:42.440
I wanted to lift those things up and just

02:14:42.440 --> 02:14:43.640
look at the sweat between them.

02:14:43.640 --> 02:14:44.200
I don't know, man.

02:14:44.200 --> 02:14:45.960
And she just, she just makes me a different person

02:14:45.960 --> 02:14:46.600
thinking about her.

02:14:48.600 --> 02:14:49.720
I want a voice like that.

02:14:50.600 --> 02:14:50.920
Right.

02:14:50.920 --> 02:14:53.080
Like she's, I don't know, man.

02:14:53.080 --> 02:14:55.240
She was cooler, whatever, but Azura.

02:14:57.640 --> 02:14:58.040
That's true.

02:14:58.040 --> 02:14:59.640
I can't really compete with her voice.

02:15:00.200 --> 02:15:00.760
Oh, sure.

02:15:00.760 --> 02:15:02.120
But her voice surpasses.

02:15:02.600 --> 02:15:05.320
Now, but you're, but you're, but you're my Oshi.

02:15:05.880 --> 02:15:07.080
I'm your Oshi?

02:15:07.800 --> 02:15:08.840
Yeah, you're my Oshi.

02:15:08.840 --> 02:15:09.960
You're fucking lying.

02:15:09.960 --> 02:15:10.760
Don't say that.

02:15:11.480 --> 02:15:13.240
Oh, I'm going to cry.

02:15:13.240 --> 02:15:15.080
Toma told me the same thing and I'm,

02:15:15.080 --> 02:15:16.280
I'm literally going to lose it.

02:15:16.280 --> 02:15:17.800
I'm going to cry into my pillow because they

02:15:17.800 --> 02:15:19.560
don't deserve anybody's love.

02:15:19.560 --> 02:15:19.880
Yep.

02:15:21.480 --> 02:15:22.200
Yeah, you're right.

02:15:24.200 --> 02:15:24.920
Who's who?

02:15:25.560 --> 02:15:27.720
The really white one either we go.

02:15:28.280 --> 02:15:31.080
And the beautiful, sexy blonde here,

02:15:31.080 --> 02:15:31.880
devil girl.

02:15:31.880 --> 02:15:32.920
I'm really cute.

02:15:32.920 --> 02:15:33.400
Devil boy.

02:15:33.400 --> 02:15:34.600
Here's his tie.

02:15:35.720 --> 02:15:36.680
Sexy.

02:15:36.680 --> 02:15:37.800
I got sexy.

02:15:37.800 --> 02:15:39.160
She's a sexy little thing.

02:15:40.280 --> 02:15:42.440
My sexy, my sexy daughter.

02:15:43.560 --> 02:15:43.880
Whoa.

02:15:43.880 --> 02:15:44.520
Yeah.

02:15:44.520 --> 02:15:46.040
And the pet bug, I guess.

02:15:47.480 --> 02:15:49.480
And my, um, garbage.

02:15:52.600 --> 02:15:53.240
No, that's worse.

02:15:53.240 --> 02:15:55.880
I prefer, I prefer, uh, she's just my little,

02:15:55.880 --> 02:15:56.840
my little buggy daughter.

02:15:57.320 --> 02:16:00.120
Um, no, the vaude is not getting nuked.

02:16:01.080 --> 02:16:02.280
The vaude is not getting nuked.

02:16:02.280 --> 02:16:02.840
Woo!

02:16:02.840 --> 02:16:03.960
The first one!

02:16:03.960 --> 02:16:05.240
First one you can keep up.

02:16:08.440 --> 02:16:10.200
Wait, do you have to nuked vods?

02:16:10.200 --> 02:16:14.200
I, I usually have to like cut or edit vods

02:16:14.200 --> 02:16:16.120
or delete them completely because I will

02:16:16.120 --> 02:16:17.720
just say really dumb shit that I'm not

02:16:17.720 --> 02:16:19.080
supposed to say on YouTube.

02:16:19.960 --> 02:16:22.680
But I say even more worse shit than I did on Twitch.

02:16:24.840 --> 02:16:25.960
The price you pay.

02:16:25.960 --> 02:16:27.160
I don't even know why.

02:16:28.440 --> 02:16:29.000
Okay.

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:29.720
I didn't know that.

02:16:31.720 --> 02:16:32.040
Yeah.

02:16:32.040 --> 02:16:34.040
You should watch, uh, honestly,

02:16:34.040 --> 02:16:35.720
Nori, you should play Class of 09.

02:16:35.720 --> 02:16:36.760
I know you'd like that game.

02:16:38.200 --> 02:16:41.080
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a visual novel elitist,

02:16:41.080 --> 02:16:42.680
so I don't play anything that gets like

02:16:43.400 --> 02:16:44.840
touched by normies, I guess.

02:16:44.840 --> 02:16:46.280
Like once it's in a normie scene, I'm like,

02:16:46.280 --> 02:16:48.920
I definitely don't think it's a normie game.

02:16:49.480 --> 02:16:50.520
I don't think it's a normie game.

02:16:50.520 --> 02:16:51.960
I, I, I've seen it.

02:16:51.960 --> 02:16:52.920
I like visual novels.

02:16:52.920 --> 02:16:54.200
Maybe I'll play it one day.

02:16:54.200 --> 02:16:54.520
Yeah.

02:16:54.520 --> 02:16:55.320
I highly, I think you're-

02:16:55.320 --> 02:16:57.560
I feel like if I play it, I start crying.

02:16:57.560 --> 02:16:57.800
Yeah.

02:16:58.760 --> 02:17:01.240
I would like to see the both of you play it,

02:17:01.240 --> 02:17:03.960
or maybe we'll do a collab where you, we go through,

02:17:04.840 --> 02:17:07.080
we go through, uh, the visual novel

02:17:07.080 --> 02:17:08.120
and just commentate on it.

02:17:08.120 --> 02:17:08.760
That would be funny.

02:17:09.880 --> 02:17:11.080
You would love that.

02:17:11.960 --> 02:17:13.000
What's an Oshi again?

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:15.160
An Oshi is like, it's, okay,

02:17:15.160 --> 02:17:18.520
it's like a huge dork for people that are new TV to be.

02:17:18.520 --> 02:17:20.120
It is idol culture thingy.

02:17:20.120 --> 02:17:22.440
So you have like, kind of like in K-pop,

02:17:22.440 --> 02:17:23.320
you have a bias.

02:17:23.320 --> 02:17:26.120
It's like one person in like maybe a group

02:17:26.200 --> 02:17:28.680
or like an individual that you really, really enjoy

02:17:29.400 --> 02:17:31.560
and you are constantly keeping like up with.

02:17:32.280 --> 02:17:35.400
So like, my Oshi would be Chibi.

02:17:35.400 --> 02:17:36.040
You know what I mean?

02:17:38.600 --> 02:17:39.880
Like, I keep up with Chibi,

02:17:39.880 --> 02:17:42.600
but my Kami Oshi is like, Ina.

02:17:43.480 --> 02:17:44.760
I have so much Ina merch.

02:17:44.760 --> 02:17:45.160
It's so bad.

02:17:45.160 --> 02:17:46.680
I made for Chibi to make merch.

02:17:46.680 --> 02:17:49.720
I didn't know that, uh, your, your Kami Oshi was Ina.

02:17:49.720 --> 02:17:50.840
That's actually cute.

02:17:50.840 --> 02:17:51.480
I do have-

02:17:51.480 --> 02:17:53.160
Make myself purple for like,

02:17:53.720 --> 02:17:56.120
every Vtuber that I've liked so far is purple.

02:17:56.120 --> 02:17:57.880
So I just make myself purple.

02:17:57.880 --> 02:17:59.560
Now that I really think about it.

02:17:59.560 --> 02:18:00.920
All my favorite Vtubers are purple.

02:18:00.920 --> 02:18:03.400
You're the only red Vtuber that I like.

02:18:03.400 --> 02:18:04.680
I was supposed to be purple.

02:18:04.680 --> 02:18:05.960
Look! I'm leaving!

02:18:05.960 --> 02:18:07.480
I'm leaving!

02:18:07.480 --> 02:18:08.520
You're my, there's, wait,

02:18:08.520 --> 02:18:09.720
but Ty, you're my friend.

02:18:11.240 --> 02:18:12.920
And Oshi will never notice me.

02:18:12.920 --> 02:18:14.280
You're the only red Vtuber.

02:18:14.280 --> 02:18:14.920
You're in-

02:18:14.920 --> 02:18:15.880
Oh!

02:18:15.880 --> 02:18:17.080
I meant my Oshi's.

02:18:17.080 --> 02:18:18.120
I meant my Oshi's.

02:18:18.120 --> 02:18:19.000
I meant my Oshi's.

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:19.800
He's sitting there.

02:18:19.800 --> 02:18:21.080
Oh, okay, okay.

02:18:21.080 --> 02:18:22.840
She's like, I like you.

02:18:23.320 --> 02:18:25.320
Um, but yes, I do have merch since you mentioned that.

02:18:25.320 --> 02:18:26.760
My merch is in my description.

02:18:27.400 --> 02:18:27.880
A wink.

02:18:30.200 --> 02:18:31.720
You can get your own, own a hole.

02:18:31.720 --> 02:18:32.200
I'm kidding.

02:18:32.200 --> 02:18:32.840
That's not true.

02:18:32.840 --> 02:18:33.160
What?

02:18:33.160 --> 02:18:33.480
You know-

02:18:33.480 --> 02:18:33.800
No!

02:18:35.080 --> 02:18:37.000
I actually, I might, I might buy it.

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:38.760
See, if you make my keychains and pins,

02:18:38.760 --> 02:18:39.800
just ping me,

02:18:39.800 --> 02:18:42.040
because I'll make a bag dedicated to you.

02:18:42.040 --> 02:18:43.240
Aw, thank you.

02:18:43.240 --> 02:18:44.040
That's really, very nice.

02:18:44.040 --> 02:18:44.760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:18:44.760 --> 02:18:46.840
I'm like a really big j-

02:18:46.840 --> 02:18:49.000
like fucking, what is it?

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:50.360
I don't nerd.

02:18:50.360 --> 02:18:51.400
Sort of this like,

02:18:51.480 --> 02:18:53.160
I'm, I'm sorry if I'm rambling.

02:18:53.160 --> 02:18:53.640
I know.

02:18:53.640 --> 02:18:56.360
Um, it's really, it's really cute when people have like bags,

02:18:56.360 --> 02:18:57.160
like eat a bag.

02:18:57.160 --> 02:19:00.040
So there's like a thing where it's literally the same merch

02:19:00.040 --> 02:19:01.240
and one bag.

02:19:01.240 --> 02:19:01.960
I didn't know that was-

02:19:01.960 --> 02:19:03.000
I forgot what they're called.

02:19:03.640 --> 02:19:04.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:19:04.920 --> 02:19:05.960
So if you do that, let me know.

02:19:05.960 --> 02:19:07.000
I have three for Ena.

02:19:08.600 --> 02:19:09.400
That's really cute.

02:19:09.400 --> 02:19:10.520
I didn't know that, Nori.

02:19:10.520 --> 02:19:11.560
That's so adorable.

02:19:12.120 --> 02:19:13.240
Hey, you just, yeah, this is just,

02:19:13.240 --> 02:19:13.640
let me know.

02:19:13.640 --> 02:19:15.480
I'm like, I like, I like pins and keychains.

02:19:15.480 --> 02:19:18.440
Pick you up and smush you against my bosom.

02:19:18.440 --> 02:19:19.880
You're so fucking adorable.

02:19:20.840 --> 02:19:22.440
I would genuinely love that.

02:19:22.440 --> 02:19:24.360
If you start feeling biting, ignore that.

02:19:27.800 --> 02:19:28.120
Oh.

02:19:28.120 --> 02:19:29.640
Don't say Ona Oshihou.

02:19:29.640 --> 02:19:30.760
That's disgusting.

02:19:31.400 --> 02:19:33.240
This is a safer work chat.

02:19:33.240 --> 02:19:34.120
You hear that?

02:19:34.120 --> 02:19:37.560
I may be screaming with a woman that does-

02:19:43.080 --> 02:19:44.760
I might be a woman of the night,

02:19:44.760 --> 02:19:46.200
but the other girls are not.

02:19:46.200 --> 02:19:47.800
They don't do the sort of content I do.

02:19:47.800 --> 02:19:50.760
So please do not think or assume or give them,

02:19:50.760 --> 02:19:52.680
like, or sexually harass them or anything

02:19:52.680 --> 02:19:54.520
because they don't make that content.

02:19:54.520 --> 02:19:57.880
They're just, you're, you know, sweet, say-so.

02:20:00.360 --> 02:20:00.840
In some ways.

02:20:00.840 --> 02:20:01.480
Oh, yeah?

02:20:01.480 --> 02:20:01.960
Yeah.

02:20:01.960 --> 02:20:02.520
Yeah.

02:20:02.520 --> 02:20:05.080
Oh, you're talking about us.

02:20:05.080 --> 02:20:06.040
You're talking about us.

02:20:06.600 --> 02:20:07.720
Oh, yeah.

02:20:07.720 --> 02:20:08.920
I'm just edgy, ma'am.

02:20:08.920 --> 02:20:09.880
What's the difference?

02:20:09.880 --> 02:20:10.280
I don't know.

02:20:11.320 --> 02:20:14.440
Once you get into the private chat in my Discord,

02:20:14.440 --> 02:20:15.560
it's a little crazy.

02:20:15.560 --> 02:20:15.880
Is it girl-central?

02:20:15.880 --> 02:20:17.960
Once you get into VC with me, it's bad.

02:20:17.960 --> 02:20:18.840
Groom!

02:20:19.480 --> 02:20:21.160
Are you getting groomed by your moths?

02:20:23.160 --> 02:20:25.080
No, you have to do the grooming yourself.

02:20:25.080 --> 02:20:27.080
Honestly, Chai-Chai would do the grooming.

02:20:27.080 --> 02:20:28.360
She just, like, she comes off as like,

02:20:28.360 --> 02:20:29.640
I'm so sweet and innocent,

02:20:29.640 --> 02:20:32.360
and then she'll just fucking groom the fuck out of you.

02:20:33.960 --> 02:20:34.920
I'd be okay with that.

02:20:35.880 --> 02:20:36.200
Same.

02:20:36.200 --> 02:20:36.760
I'm here.

02:20:36.760 --> 02:20:37.560
I'd be okay.

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:40.040
I don't know what I should say.

02:20:40.040 --> 02:20:40.600
All right, Chai-Chai.

02:20:41.400 --> 02:20:41.880
Uh-uh.

02:20:42.840 --> 02:20:43.960
Let me, uh, look at the-

02:20:43.960 --> 02:20:44.440
Oh, no.

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:45.480
Oh, my God.

02:20:45.480 --> 02:20:46.200
And say thank you.

02:20:46.200 --> 02:20:47.000
I feel kind of bad,

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:48.840
because I feel like I rumble a lot.

02:20:48.840 --> 02:20:49.400
Oh, Chai-Chai.

02:20:49.400 --> 02:20:50.120
You're fine.

02:20:50.120 --> 02:20:51.240
I feel the same thing.

02:20:51.240 --> 02:20:52.200
My-my chat knows-

02:20:52.200 --> 02:20:53.560
Chai-Chai, this is our podcast.

02:20:53.560 --> 02:20:54.680
You can say whatever you want.

02:20:55.240 --> 02:20:57.320
My chat knows how much I app, so they-

02:20:57.320 --> 02:20:57.880
They-

02:20:57.880 --> 02:20:58.920
I guess.

02:20:58.920 --> 02:21:00.600
Love you and Chai for the same reason.

02:21:00.600 --> 02:21:02.040
Why do you act like I don't watch your streams?

02:21:02.040 --> 02:21:02.760
Woman, I'm there.

02:21:02.760 --> 02:21:03.320
I know that.

02:21:03.320 --> 02:21:03.880
I'm there.

02:21:03.880 --> 02:21:04.440
What do you mean?

02:21:04.440 --> 02:21:05.960
I haven't seen your name!

02:21:05.960 --> 02:21:06.440
Are you lurking?

02:21:06.440 --> 02:21:07.400
Oh, I just look type.

02:21:07.960 --> 02:21:08.440
God.

02:21:08.440 --> 02:21:08.920
Okay.

02:21:08.920 --> 02:21:09.640
Because I want to-

02:21:09.640 --> 02:21:10.120
I get-

02:21:10.120 --> 02:21:12.120
I get scared when people notice me.

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:13.400
I don't-

02:21:13.400 --> 02:21:14.760
Actually, I feel the same way, so-

02:21:14.760 --> 02:21:16.360
Okay, I'll never notice you ever.

02:21:16.360 --> 02:21:17.800
I'll never perceive you.

02:21:17.800 --> 02:21:18.360
No!

02:21:18.360 --> 02:21:19.800
It's like, I don't want to explain it,

02:21:19.800 --> 02:21:22.520
because then sometimes their chat starts talking to you,

02:21:22.520 --> 02:21:22.840
and you're like,

02:21:22.840 --> 02:21:24.040
oh, my God, please don't.

02:21:24.040 --> 02:21:25.240
Please, I want to pee everywhere.

02:21:25.240 --> 02:21:25.960
Don't do this.

02:21:25.960 --> 02:21:27.400
You're gonna pee everywhere?

02:21:27.400 --> 02:21:28.680
Yeah, I know what you mean.

02:21:28.680 --> 02:21:29.480
Sometimes when you-

02:21:29.480 --> 02:21:30.120
It's like, it's-

02:21:30.120 --> 02:21:31.800
It's exciting when you talk in a French chat,

02:21:31.800 --> 02:21:32.280
because then you're like,

02:21:32.280 --> 02:21:33.240
oh, my God, hi!

02:21:33.240 --> 02:21:34.840
But then you're like, oh, no, I'm like,

02:21:34.840 --> 02:21:35.400
I don't know.

02:21:35.400 --> 02:21:35.960
It's like-

02:21:35.960 --> 02:21:37.640
Because like, you're taking away a pension from-

02:21:37.640 --> 02:21:38.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, right?

02:21:38.440 --> 02:21:39.320
This was really bad.

02:21:39.320 --> 02:21:41.720
I felt like, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah.

02:21:41.720 --> 02:21:44.040
That's why I usually only say one or two things,

02:21:44.040 --> 02:21:45.640
because I don't-

02:21:45.640 --> 02:21:47.240
Like, especially with my gen mates,

02:21:47.240 --> 02:21:51.080
because sometimes people move the chat's focus on me.

02:21:51.080 --> 02:21:52.600
So I'm just like, I'll say hi,

02:21:52.600 --> 02:21:53.480
and then I'll be like-

02:21:53.480 --> 02:21:54.280
Yeah, quiet.

02:21:54.280 --> 02:21:54.600
Quiet.

02:21:54.600 --> 02:21:55.160
Yeah.

02:21:55.160 --> 02:21:55.640
Yeah.

02:21:55.640 --> 02:21:57.080
You're gonna be like, yeah.

02:21:57.080 --> 02:21:57.720
What?

02:21:57.720 --> 02:21:58.920
Were you just underwater?

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:02.040
Oh, it's hilarious.

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:04.760
Someone in my mic panel kills itself.

02:22:04.760 --> 02:22:05.320
Oh, so I just noticed-

02:22:05.320 --> 02:22:06.920
Can you guys hold your arms?

02:22:06.920 --> 02:22:08.120
Yeah, I'm Hispanic.

02:22:08.200 --> 02:22:08.680
Try.

02:22:09.880 --> 02:22:10.360
Sorry.

02:22:11.560 --> 02:22:13.160
I'm so sorry you're Hispanic.

02:22:14.200 --> 02:22:15.160
Yeah, my bad.

02:22:15.160 --> 02:22:16.120
I'm sorry, guys.

02:22:16.120 --> 02:22:16.360
I am-

02:22:17.560 --> 02:22:18.280
I'm sorry.

02:22:18.280 --> 02:22:18.760
I know.

02:22:18.760 --> 02:22:19.240
I know.

02:22:19.960 --> 02:22:21.320
I'm gonna hold the box and see.

02:22:21.320 --> 02:22:22.840
Ha-ra, ha-ra, ha-ra.

02:22:22.840 --> 02:22:23.400
Ha-ra.

02:22:23.400 --> 02:22:23.800
Rrrr.

02:22:24.680 --> 02:22:26.200
Ha-ra, ha-ra-ee-ba.

02:22:26.200 --> 02:22:27.080
Ha-ra-ee-ba.

02:22:27.080 --> 02:22:28.280
I want to learn how to purr.

02:22:28.280 --> 02:22:28.760
Rrr.

02:22:28.760 --> 02:22:29.320
Rrr.

02:22:29.320 --> 02:22:30.040
Rrr.

02:22:30.040 --> 02:22:30.600
Rrr.

02:22:30.600 --> 02:22:31.320
Rrr.

02:22:31.320 --> 02:22:31.640
Rrr.

02:22:31.640 --> 02:22:32.440
Rrr.

02:22:32.440 --> 02:22:32.920
Rrr.

02:22:32.920 --> 02:22:33.400
Rrr.

02:22:33.400 --> 02:22:33.960
Rrr.

02:22:33.960 --> 02:22:34.600
Rrr.

02:22:34.600 --> 02:22:35.160
Rrr.

02:22:35.160 --> 02:22:36.200
It's the favorite word.

02:22:36.200 --> 02:22:36.840
Rrr.

02:22:36.840 --> 02:22:37.160
OK.

02:22:37.160 --> 02:22:37.640
Hold on.

02:22:37.640 --> 02:22:40.020
I'm gonna definitely say thank yous for Dota's and shit.

02:22:40.020 --> 02:22:40.860
I'll be right back.

02:22:40.860 --> 02:22:41.700
Okay, go do it.

02:22:41.700 --> 02:22:42.540
Do it.

02:22:45.260 --> 02:22:47.220
I love them so much there.

02:22:47.220 --> 02:22:48.060
Oh my God.

02:22:48.060 --> 02:22:50.500
I'm so thankful to have them as friends.

02:22:50.500 --> 02:22:53.220
It's been a deep up too strong.

02:22:53.220 --> 02:22:54.780
It's been a good present.

02:22:55.780 --> 02:22:58.340
Yeah, that's what the conversation

02:22:58.340 --> 02:22:59.740
will turn to with these two.

02:23:01.820 --> 02:23:03.780
But thank you, Charlie.

02:23:03.780 --> 02:23:04.700
She'd be pleased for giving me

02:23:04.700 --> 02:23:07.260
from about to do bark, bark, bark, bark.

02:23:07.260 --> 02:23:09.020
Thank you for the five bucks.

02:23:09.020 --> 02:23:11.580
But thank you for the shibbity toilet.

02:23:12.620 --> 02:23:13.820
Thank you for the tip, boy.

02:23:13.820 --> 02:23:16.660
She'd be playing with her two daughters, so wholesome.

02:23:16.660 --> 02:23:20.820
Thank you for the $20 two-tool, beep, beep, bless.

02:23:20.820 --> 02:23:23.460
I haven't heard that in a long time.

02:23:23.460 --> 02:23:24.340
Please let Nori know.

02:23:24.340 --> 02:23:26.220
She has a whole paper set in her, your chat.

02:23:26.220 --> 02:23:27.060
She can risen up.

02:23:27.060 --> 02:23:28.700
Oh, she knows, she knows.

02:23:28.700 --> 02:23:30.420
Thank you, Morgan.

02:23:30.420 --> 02:23:31.580
But thank you guys.

02:23:33.780 --> 02:23:36.540
I already know that you guys are having as much fun as me.

02:23:36.540 --> 02:23:37.900
I don't even have to ask.

02:23:37.900 --> 02:23:39.180
All right, watch, I'm an undefined

02:23:39.180 --> 02:23:41.940
and they're probably me saying the most ridiculous shit.

02:23:41.940 --> 02:23:44.380
It's like, oh, nice, happy, happy times.

02:23:44.380 --> 02:23:47.020
That's exactly just how it feels sometimes.

02:23:47.020 --> 02:23:49.340
Yeah, I had a nap.

02:23:49.340 --> 02:23:50.340
I also had a nap.

02:23:50.340 --> 02:23:52.980
I was scared I wasn't gonna wake up in time for the collab.

02:23:52.980 --> 02:23:54.940
But I was genuinely like, if I sleep now,

02:23:54.940 --> 02:23:57.140
I don't know if I'll wake up on time.

02:23:57.140 --> 02:23:59.340
Yeah, I set an alarm.

02:23:59.340 --> 02:24:01.460
I feel like, yeah, you know when you have those naps

02:24:01.460 --> 02:24:03.460
where it's like you're, oh, home.

02:24:03.460 --> 02:24:04.300
She back?

02:24:04.300 --> 02:24:05.700
I went back.

02:24:06.660 --> 02:24:08.740
I was just like, I was like listening to you guys talk.

02:24:08.740 --> 02:24:09.700
Oh, cute.

02:24:09.700 --> 02:24:10.700
To each other about her napping.

02:24:10.700 --> 02:24:12.460
I'm talking about her napping.

02:24:12.460 --> 02:24:15.220
I had really stressful dreams because like,

02:24:15.220 --> 02:24:17.460
I feel like I went, I napped.

02:24:17.460 --> 02:24:19.900
Like, I was like, okay, I have to like get up

02:24:19.900 --> 02:24:20.900
after this stuff.

02:24:20.900 --> 02:24:24.260
I have to, oh wait, raid, raid, raid.

02:24:24.260 --> 02:24:25.220
Wait, oh my God, raid.

02:24:25.220 --> 02:24:26.060
Hold on a second.

02:24:27.140 --> 02:24:27.980
Oh, she's gone.

02:24:27.980 --> 02:24:30.140
Thank you for the raid.

02:24:30.140 --> 02:24:31.460
Thank you for the raid.

02:24:31.460 --> 02:24:32.300
Oh my God.

02:24:34.740 --> 02:24:35.660
Oh, she's muted.

02:24:35.700 --> 02:24:36.540
What the fuck?

02:24:36.540 --> 02:24:38.540
She's like, I disappeared.

02:24:39.940 --> 02:24:41.780
She was shrimped.

02:24:41.780 --> 02:24:43.260
What was it gonna say?

02:24:43.260 --> 02:24:44.740
I take naps all the time.

02:24:44.740 --> 02:24:46.460
I have a nap time schedule.

02:24:46.460 --> 02:24:47.500
Like a pod board.

02:24:47.500 --> 02:24:49.700
I've napped for like probably three hours today.

02:24:49.700 --> 02:24:52.260
So that's why I don't know why I'm still so tired.

02:24:52.260 --> 02:24:54.060
Yeah, I sleep at three or five.

02:24:54.060 --> 02:24:57.140
No, in between, I'm just a child.

02:24:57.140 --> 02:25:00.540
I know it's hard because I stream in my time slot

02:25:00.540 --> 02:25:02.960
at the same time that I would normally nap.

02:25:02.960 --> 02:25:04.660
So I have to nap earlier.

02:25:04.660 --> 02:25:06.620
So then I sleep later or I nap later

02:25:06.620 --> 02:25:08.740
and I sleep later and then I wake up at like 11.

02:25:08.740 --> 02:25:10.500
I don't go to sleep until like five a.m.

02:25:10.500 --> 02:25:13.980
and then I wake up at like 10 a.m., 10 p.m., 10 a.m.

02:25:13.980 --> 02:25:14.940
all the time.

02:25:16.660 --> 02:25:18.380
I have a horrible sleep schedule.

02:25:18.380 --> 02:25:19.420
Don't nod.

02:25:19.420 --> 02:25:21.260
I'm sorry, I've been yawning.

02:25:21.260 --> 02:25:22.100
I'm yawning.

02:25:22.100 --> 02:25:23.340
So I'm sorry.

02:25:23.340 --> 02:25:24.180
Container.

02:25:24.180 --> 02:25:25.020
You didn't go while you didn't go.

02:25:25.020 --> 02:25:25.980
I'm boring or something.

02:25:25.980 --> 02:25:28.260
No, I love you, stop.

02:25:28.260 --> 02:25:29.980
Me, me, me, me.

02:25:29.980 --> 02:25:32.980
Also, I'm so sorry, it's hair on my hair.

02:25:32.980 --> 02:25:33.820
Yeah, hair on my hair.

02:25:34.100 --> 02:25:34.940
Oh my God.

02:25:34.940 --> 02:25:38.540
I made your, you're too much stream-solid.

02:25:39.420 --> 02:25:41.580
It's the only time slot I'm available.

02:25:42.860 --> 02:25:45.060
It's fine, they understand.

02:25:45.060 --> 02:25:47.940
No, it's, you're guilty about it.

02:25:47.940 --> 02:25:49.180
No, I don't feel guilty.

02:25:49.180 --> 02:25:52.660
They're, I bet they believe that it was worth it

02:25:52.660 --> 02:25:54.260
so they got to meet you and try.

02:25:54.260 --> 02:25:55.100
So.

02:25:55.100 --> 02:25:55.940
I hope so.

02:25:55.940 --> 02:25:56.780
Yep.

02:25:56.780 --> 02:25:57.780
I hope they liked it.

02:25:57.780 --> 02:25:58.620
Yeah, I hope they did.

02:25:58.620 --> 02:26:00.100
I'm just not, I'm gonna be all sad

02:26:00.100 --> 02:26:01.940
when I lie being around you.

02:26:01.940 --> 02:26:02.780
No.

02:26:02.900 --> 02:26:03.900
Yes, I missed you.

02:26:03.900 --> 02:26:04.740
I missed you a bunch.

02:26:04.740 --> 02:26:05.580
All right.

02:26:05.580 --> 02:26:06.420
No, you didn't miss me.

02:26:06.420 --> 02:26:07.260
We just met.

02:26:07.260 --> 02:26:08.100
We just met.

02:26:08.100 --> 02:26:09.420
What am I talking about?

02:26:09.420 --> 02:26:10.260
We just met.

02:26:10.260 --> 02:26:11.580
We spent a little night.

02:26:11.580 --> 02:26:13.420
You just met.

02:26:13.420 --> 02:26:14.660
It's just the dreams.

02:26:14.660 --> 02:26:16.100
You've just been in my dreams.

02:26:16.100 --> 02:26:18.300
So it feels like we've known each other for months.

02:26:18.300 --> 02:26:20.260
You've worked with me in my dreams.

02:26:23.260 --> 02:26:24.860
What's happened to dreams, really?

02:26:27.580 --> 02:26:28.500
I can tell you one of them.

02:26:28.500 --> 02:26:29.900
I'm actually, I've had dreams.

02:26:29.900 --> 02:26:31.980
It was weird though, cause he felt like,

02:26:32.060 --> 02:26:33.580
you know, like you ever have like,

02:26:33.580 --> 02:26:35.180
it's like we were an animic.

02:26:35.180 --> 02:26:36.540
It was like in the real world.

02:26:36.540 --> 02:26:38.500
So it was like you, but I was like a real person.

02:26:38.500 --> 02:26:39.620
I don't know how to explain it.

02:26:39.620 --> 02:26:41.860
Was I white or was I brown?

02:26:41.860 --> 02:26:43.060
You were kind of tanned.

02:26:43.060 --> 02:26:44.060
You were like tan.

02:26:44.060 --> 02:26:44.900
Interesting.

02:26:44.900 --> 02:26:45.740
You were like a tan.

02:26:45.740 --> 02:26:46.580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:26:46.580 --> 02:26:48.100
But, but there was like a weird dream

02:26:48.100 --> 02:26:49.500
and we were just talking to me

02:26:49.500 --> 02:26:50.620
and like you were holding my hand.

02:26:50.620 --> 02:26:51.780
I was like, oh my God.

02:26:52.700 --> 02:26:53.540
She's touching me.

02:26:53.540 --> 02:26:54.380
Oh my God.

02:26:54.380 --> 02:26:55.420
Yeah, like she's touching me.

02:26:55.420 --> 02:26:56.620
She's touching my hands.

02:26:56.620 --> 02:26:58.540
Oh my, oh my days.

02:26:58.540 --> 02:26:59.900
Oh, good Lord.

02:26:59.900 --> 02:27:01.460
Oh my days.

02:27:01.460 --> 02:27:03.900
I would love to go to a convention with you.

02:27:03.900 --> 02:27:05.300
That'd be fun.

02:27:05.300 --> 02:27:10.140
There's, I am hopefully planning to go to one.

02:27:11.140 --> 02:27:12.780
I don't think you are,

02:27:12.780 --> 02:27:15.460
I don't think your place of work is very far

02:27:15.460 --> 02:27:17.140
from my little, my little hole in the hole.

02:27:17.140 --> 02:27:17.980
Hi!

02:27:17.980 --> 02:27:19.020
Hi, Ty.

02:27:19.020 --> 02:27:21.100
Oh, did you guys know that I quit my job?

02:27:21.980 --> 02:27:22.980
Yeah, I saw that.

02:27:22.980 --> 02:27:24.300
Yeah, I saw that.

02:27:24.300 --> 02:27:26.900
So I can, I can probably just

02:27:27.820 --> 02:27:32.620
chalk myself across the states and go to you.

02:27:32.620 --> 02:27:34.780
Wait, we're meeting in person?

02:27:34.780 --> 02:27:37.020
No, I mean, like we're just,

02:27:37.020 --> 02:27:38.900
she was telling me she had a dream

02:27:38.900 --> 02:27:40.460
that we went to a con together.

02:27:40.460 --> 02:27:43.220
And I was like, oh, I love what we're talking.

02:27:43.220 --> 02:27:45.940
Koreans grind, Koreans grind.

02:27:45.940 --> 02:27:47.020
Thank you for the follow.

02:27:47.020 --> 02:27:52.020
Oh, oh, I was like, oh, good about Korean's that grind.

02:27:52.100 --> 02:27:53.060
Oh, I love Korean's.

02:27:53.060 --> 02:27:55.020
Wait, Noriko, someone said more,

02:27:55.020 --> 02:27:57.100
Noriko, more like stinky co.

02:27:57.100 --> 02:27:58.420
I just thought you should know that.

02:27:58.420 --> 02:27:59.540
I learned them.

02:27:59.540 --> 02:28:00.380
Who said that?

02:28:00.380 --> 02:28:01.220
Who said that?

02:28:01.220 --> 02:28:02.060
Give me, give me.

02:28:02.060 --> 02:28:02.900
Their names?

02:28:02.900 --> 02:28:03.740
Self mechanic.

02:28:03.740 --> 02:28:04.580
I was going to ban them,

02:28:04.580 --> 02:28:05.420
but they're a certified tune,

02:28:05.420 --> 02:28:06.820
but I don't think I should ban them.

02:28:06.820 --> 02:28:08.420
No, you should just

02:28:08.420 --> 02:28:10.700
flick them really hard in the forehead.

02:28:10.700 --> 02:28:12.540
Why in the forehead?

02:28:12.540 --> 02:28:13.700
Because that's where I remember my mom was.

02:28:13.700 --> 02:28:15.260
Oh, you said flick them.

02:28:15.260 --> 02:28:17.300
I've heard something else.

02:28:17.300 --> 02:28:18.820
Yeah, you flick them in the forehead.

02:28:18.820 --> 02:28:20.380
I thought you said fuck them in the forehead

02:28:20.380 --> 02:28:23.100
and I was a little bit confused.

02:28:23.100 --> 02:28:24.900
Oh, I guess from like the lobotomy.

02:28:24.900 --> 02:28:26.380
Oh, yeah, there you go.

02:28:26.380 --> 02:28:28.380
Well, that's kind of like the eye socket.

02:28:29.460 --> 02:28:30.780
Doll spoon.

02:28:30.780 --> 02:28:33.100
Oh, that's such silly little names, huh?

02:28:34.100 --> 02:28:35.340
Okay, are we going to a con?

02:28:35.340 --> 02:28:36.740
I want to go to a con with you guys.

02:28:36.740 --> 02:28:38.020
Do you guys like the cosplay?

02:28:38.020 --> 02:28:39.540
Do you guys like the cosplay?

02:28:39.540 --> 02:28:40.380
I'm too.

02:28:40.380 --> 02:28:41.780
I do like the cosplay.

02:28:41.780 --> 02:28:43.500
I cosplayed myself.

02:28:45.100 --> 02:28:46.420
They're so good.

02:28:46.420 --> 02:28:48.260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:28:48.260 --> 02:28:49.580
Huge boobies.

02:28:50.820 --> 02:28:51.700
You have pictures.

02:28:51.700 --> 02:28:53.300
I just noticed that one of you guys

02:28:53.300 --> 02:28:55.100
sounds like Ruby Rose from Ruby.

02:28:55.100 --> 02:28:56.380
Which one?

02:28:56.380 --> 02:28:58.140
I don't think it's me.

02:28:58.140 --> 02:28:58.980
Huh?

02:28:58.980 --> 02:29:01.100
I get told I sound like Mabel in Peridot.

02:29:02.060 --> 02:29:03.060
Oh, you do?

02:29:03.060 --> 02:29:04.820
Oh, that's actually true.

02:29:04.820 --> 02:29:05.940
Oh my God, that's so true.

02:29:05.940 --> 02:29:07.260
You sound like Peridot.

02:29:07.260 --> 02:29:08.580
That's so real.

02:29:08.580 --> 02:29:10.700
I know, I get to sound like Peridot a lot.

02:29:10.700 --> 02:29:11.620
Wait, who do I sound like?

02:29:11.620 --> 02:29:12.900
Who do I sound like?

02:29:12.900 --> 02:29:15.020
I want to sound like you from Ruby.

02:29:15.020 --> 02:29:17.020
I think they say, yeah, they think you

02:29:17.020 --> 02:29:19.260
sound like Ruby Rose from Ruby.

02:29:19.260 --> 02:29:20.820
That's cool.

02:29:20.820 --> 02:29:21.660
Me?

02:29:21.660 --> 02:29:22.900
Yeah, you.

02:29:23.100 --> 02:29:24.100
Ruby Rose?

02:29:24.100 --> 02:29:24.940
Ruby Rose?

02:29:24.940 --> 02:29:26.500
Is that the girl with the red hair?

02:29:26.500 --> 02:29:27.940
Yeah, black and red?

02:29:27.940 --> 02:29:29.860
Oh, she has some color palette, too.

02:29:30.700 --> 02:29:32.380
Oh my gosh.

02:29:32.380 --> 02:29:34.340
I got to hurt the typing.

02:29:34.340 --> 02:29:36.660
Wait, like Ruby Rose, like Ruby Rose,

02:29:36.660 --> 02:29:39.700
like the not like the Australian model in action.

02:29:39.700 --> 02:29:40.940
No, not.

02:29:40.940 --> 02:29:42.100
No, no, no, Ruby Rose.

02:29:42.100 --> 02:29:45.140
You sound just like her when you do your Australian accent.

02:29:45.140 --> 02:29:46.580
How do you do that?

02:29:46.580 --> 02:29:47.420
Australia.

02:29:47.420 --> 02:29:48.260
What?

02:29:48.260 --> 02:29:49.100
Australia.

02:29:49.100 --> 02:29:50.580
Australia.

02:29:50.580 --> 02:29:51.740
Australia.

02:29:51.740 --> 02:29:56.100
My chat also agrees that they kind of hear the Ruby.

02:29:56.100 --> 02:29:57.300
Who's Ruby?

02:29:57.300 --> 02:29:58.500
Kind of, who is it?

02:29:58.500 --> 02:29:59.340
Ruby Rose.

02:29:59.340 --> 02:30:00.660
Oh, you know, oh, I send it to you.

02:30:00.660 --> 02:30:02.900
It's a little like red girl, is it not?

02:30:02.900 --> 02:30:03.900
With the red hair.

02:30:03.900 --> 02:30:06.740
I never watch Ruby, so I don't know.

02:30:06.740 --> 02:30:07.580
Not gonna go.

02:30:07.580 --> 02:30:08.420
Guys, I'm feeling stupid.

02:30:08.420 --> 02:30:09.660
Oh, that girl.

02:30:09.660 --> 02:30:10.900
Also, wait, Chai, do you?

02:30:10.900 --> 02:30:12.620
Oh, wait.

02:30:12.620 --> 02:30:14.820
What the fuck is this GIF?

02:30:14.820 --> 02:30:15.980
You cost, it's from the show.

02:30:15.980 --> 02:30:18.060
The show sucks, by the way.

02:30:18.060 --> 02:30:20.060
I didn't watch the first season.

02:30:20.060 --> 02:30:20.900
Chai, did you watch the show?

02:30:20.980 --> 02:30:22.820
I was really proud.

02:30:22.820 --> 02:30:23.660
Have I?

02:30:23.660 --> 02:30:24.860
Yeah.

02:30:24.860 --> 02:30:29.300
I want you so bad, I beg and I plead and I pray and I ask.

02:30:29.300 --> 02:30:32.980
It's just a lot because of the jacket.

02:30:32.980 --> 02:30:35.460
I gotta get the jacket commissioned.

02:30:35.460 --> 02:30:36.300
That's true.

02:30:36.300 --> 02:30:38.380
But everything else I can figure out,

02:30:38.380 --> 02:30:40.540
like 3D printing, like certain parts,

02:30:40.540 --> 02:30:42.460
and like the cuffs and the chains.

02:30:42.460 --> 02:30:43.820
You know how to 3D print?

02:30:45.940 --> 02:30:48.780
I can, I have the ability to.

02:30:48.780 --> 02:30:51.620
I don't have a 3D printer, but I know someone who does.

02:30:51.620 --> 02:30:53.220
Oh, that's pretty cool.

02:30:53.220 --> 02:30:56.740
And I get down on my hands and knees and say, please.

02:30:56.740 --> 02:30:58.060
Please.

02:30:58.060 --> 02:30:59.380
I think it would work out.

02:31:00.740 --> 02:31:02.620
I do cosplay, though.

02:31:02.620 --> 02:31:04.700
I just got back from a convention.

02:31:04.700 --> 02:31:06.820
I cosplayed three different ladies.

02:31:06.820 --> 02:31:09.500
I was freerun, freerun.

02:31:09.500 --> 02:31:12.740
Oh my gosh, you would be so good as freerun.

02:31:12.740 --> 02:31:15.260
I did her dinner, dinner.

02:31:15.260 --> 02:31:16.540
Oh my gosh, I have to.

02:31:16.540 --> 02:31:17.660
I can show you guys pictures.

02:31:17.660 --> 02:31:19.260
Please.

02:31:19.260 --> 02:31:22.460
Yeah, I think they're really appropriate.

02:31:22.460 --> 02:31:29.180
I have a blue archive cosplay that just arrived of Hoshino.

02:31:29.180 --> 02:31:33.540
And I also cosplayed a chopper from One Piece.

02:31:33.540 --> 02:31:34.260
Oh, that's funny.

02:31:34.260 --> 02:31:35.220
Oh, that's funny.

02:31:35.220 --> 02:31:36.980
Do you have pictures of that one?

02:31:36.980 --> 02:31:38.580
Yeah, I'm getting into One Piece.

02:31:38.580 --> 02:31:40.540
I'm still getting into One Piece.

02:31:40.540 --> 02:31:41.540
Yeah.

02:31:41.540 --> 02:31:44.980
I watched the Netflix live action.

02:31:44.980 --> 02:31:45.980
Yeah, that was pretty good.

02:31:45.980 --> 02:31:49.940
It hooked me in like, OK, now I have to kind of watch the show.

02:31:49.940 --> 02:31:52.540
Oh, yeah, I did watch the live action, too, yeah.

02:31:52.540 --> 02:31:55.340
I would love to cosplay, but I have really bad anxiety,

02:31:55.340 --> 02:31:58.380
so I don't leave my home enough to do that.

02:31:58.380 --> 02:32:01.700
I haven't cosplayed in years at an actual convention.

02:32:01.700 --> 02:32:03.660
It's been a very, very long time.

02:32:03.660 --> 02:32:05.100
It's a whole other night.

02:32:05.100 --> 02:32:07.420
Cosplaying at home is a lot less exhausting.

02:32:10.100 --> 02:32:10.700
I don't know.

02:32:10.700 --> 02:32:14.500
It's just like, I guess the fear of buying a cosplay

02:32:14.500 --> 02:32:16.180
and then be like, I should have, like, work with you.

02:32:16.180 --> 02:32:18.780
Oh, like, yeah, if it doesn't get all the money right.

02:32:18.780 --> 02:32:20.820
My boobs usually don't fit into a lot of things,

02:32:20.820 --> 02:32:25.340
so I'd have to play a very big, boobed character.

02:32:25.340 --> 02:32:26.940
Yeah, I have that problem, too.

02:32:26.940 --> 02:32:28.220
I have that problem, too.

02:32:28.220 --> 02:32:29.780
Yeah.

02:32:29.780 --> 02:32:30.780
My point.

02:32:30.780 --> 02:32:33.180
Yeah.

02:32:33.180 --> 02:32:38.220
Chai's body type is essentially her model, Koff.

02:32:38.220 --> 02:32:39.300
It's really sad.

02:32:39.300 --> 02:32:41.620
My model is taller, though.

02:32:41.620 --> 02:32:43.740
I think my model would probably fit into cosplays

02:32:43.780 --> 02:32:45.940
better than I could, just because of me.

02:32:45.940 --> 02:32:46.980
I think I'm smaller.

02:32:46.980 --> 02:32:47.780
She's so small.

02:32:47.780 --> 02:32:48.540
It's like, sucks.

02:32:48.540 --> 02:32:49.260
Yeah.

02:32:49.260 --> 02:32:51.100
It's like, oh, cute.

02:32:51.100 --> 02:32:54.580
There are a lot of really cute characters in my opinion.

02:32:54.580 --> 02:32:57.060
I feel like you can ask me a lot of hard things.

02:32:57.060 --> 02:32:58.460
Sometimes they make the small.

02:32:58.460 --> 02:33:01.060
Sometimes the small isn't even, like, small.

02:33:01.060 --> 02:33:01.580
I don't know.

02:33:01.580 --> 02:33:05.940
I think I'm just, I'm just stubby.

02:33:05.940 --> 02:33:08.940
No, I'm stubby.

02:33:08.940 --> 02:33:11.460
For me, it's a lot of the time the cosplay parents

02:33:11.460 --> 02:33:14.100
never go past my buttocks.

02:33:14.100 --> 02:33:16.100
She's got a fat ass.

02:33:16.100 --> 02:33:17.820
Yeah, my bag.

02:33:17.820 --> 02:33:18.620
Yeah, yeah.

02:33:18.620 --> 02:33:19.940
She's small with a fat ass.

02:33:19.940 --> 02:33:22.260
Wait, don't be boob fat ass.

02:33:22.260 --> 02:33:23.180
And let me have you.

02:33:23.180 --> 02:33:25.140
You need to, man, too.

02:33:25.140 --> 02:33:27.620
And then your little cute pet hunt.

02:33:27.620 --> 02:33:30.140
OK, I'm also kind of, I'm also kind of pet-on,

02:33:30.140 --> 02:33:30.740
so it's fine.

02:33:30.740 --> 02:33:32.980
Yeah, you're also a pet-on, yeah.

02:33:32.980 --> 02:33:33.980
Now we start that in sim.

02:33:33.980 --> 02:33:36.180
It's just my butt.

02:33:36.180 --> 02:33:37.420
That's the Hispanic jeans.

02:33:37.420 --> 02:33:38.540
Just hit her there.

02:33:38.540 --> 02:33:40.380
Yeah, it's just my butt.

02:33:40.380 --> 02:33:41.060
I don't know why.

02:33:41.140 --> 02:33:42.380
I don't understand.

02:33:42.380 --> 02:33:44.220
I also haven't cosplayed in a long time

02:33:44.220 --> 02:33:47.580
because people sometimes when you're brown

02:33:47.580 --> 02:33:48.420
and you cosplay a white character.

02:33:48.420 --> 02:33:50.260
Oh my god, it's so bad.

02:33:50.260 --> 02:33:52.980
They just bitch and moan and I'm like, I don't.

02:33:52.980 --> 02:33:53.460
Yeah.

02:33:53.460 --> 02:33:55.700
You get called like the hard-art name version

02:33:55.700 --> 02:33:56.500
of the character.

02:33:56.500 --> 02:34:00.780
It's so, it's so, it's so mad.

02:34:00.780 --> 02:34:02.900
It's like, damn, it's like they kind of got me there.

02:34:02.900 --> 02:34:06.060
They'll be like, N-word, Shinobi or something like that.

02:34:06.060 --> 02:34:08.980
I think I've seen that for like Gojo when somebody was

02:34:08.980 --> 02:34:10.140
cosplaying as Gojo.

02:34:11.940 --> 02:34:13.980
That's like the one thing that works.

02:34:13.980 --> 02:34:16.660
No, no, no, I've seen somebody like a black Gojo

02:34:16.660 --> 02:34:19.300
and people just fucking ragged on them.

02:34:19.300 --> 02:34:20.580
It's ridiculous.

02:34:20.580 --> 02:34:23.620
The cosplay community is like, it's just, you know,

02:34:23.620 --> 02:34:25.620
like the cosplay community just kind of sucks.

02:34:25.620 --> 02:34:31.300
Like it's very toxic and it's not warm and fuzzy

02:34:31.300 --> 02:34:32.700
for the most part, but I can tell you.

02:34:32.700 --> 02:34:36.500
Which is sucks because it's like, OK, this is not really weird.

02:34:36.580 --> 02:34:38.940
I think when anime got mainstream and all the very

02:34:38.940 --> 02:34:41.060
attractive people started doing cosplay,

02:34:41.060 --> 02:34:43.620
it kind of ruined the vibe of like, oh, it's just a bunch

02:34:43.620 --> 02:34:45.380
of nerds having fun together.

02:34:45.380 --> 02:34:47.660
I agree, but it's like, when anime-

02:34:47.660 --> 02:34:49.100
It's like Hot Girl Central.

02:34:49.100 --> 02:34:51.540
Yeah, because it's like, in my opinion,

02:34:51.540 --> 02:34:54.900
I appreciate like a more like messy looking cosplay

02:34:54.900 --> 02:34:56.940
because like you can tell that they really like the character

02:34:56.940 --> 02:35:00.180
than like a full blown, like full glam cosplay

02:35:00.180 --> 02:35:01.340
because it's just for photo shoots.

02:35:01.340 --> 02:35:05.460
Like, um, anime becoming popular sucks, it's so bad.

02:35:05.460 --> 02:35:06.620
It's like retubing, too.

02:35:06.620 --> 02:35:07.820
Like, it's so bad.

02:35:07.820 --> 02:35:09.420
It's very mainstream, though.

02:35:09.420 --> 02:35:10.980
It's sad. It is sad.

02:35:10.980 --> 02:35:13.460
And it sucks to like say it because then you sound like

02:35:13.460 --> 02:35:16.180
like a gatekeeper, like even gatekeeper.

02:35:16.180 --> 02:35:18.340
But it's like, but it's true.

02:35:18.340 --> 02:35:21.020
It is true because like the feeling of like the anime,

02:35:21.020 --> 02:35:23.860
the community, the cosplay community and all that, like,

02:35:23.860 --> 02:35:28.820
it was so different before like 2020, I'd say, like 20.

02:35:28.820 --> 02:35:30.980
Yeah, 2020, like right around the pandemic,

02:35:30.980 --> 02:35:32.900
when it did get really popular.

02:35:32.900 --> 02:35:34.180
It was like, oh my God, yay.

02:35:34.180 --> 02:35:36.500
All the people who bullied me, like finally, like,

02:35:36.500 --> 02:35:38.140
now you guys can see it's cool.

02:35:38.140 --> 02:35:40.580
But at the same time, like a lot of, yeah.

02:35:40.580 --> 02:35:41.780
But yeah, exactly right.

02:35:41.780 --> 02:35:43.780
Like, God damn, this is like, this is my thing.

02:35:43.780 --> 02:35:45.940
It's like, yay, I know, it's supposed to be my thing,

02:35:45.940 --> 02:35:48.020
where I was supposed to be like this little geek.

02:35:48.020 --> 02:35:50.580
Like, they do it better because they're like hot and sexy

02:35:50.580 --> 02:35:51.460
and like have a lot of.

02:35:51.460 --> 02:35:56.100
It also sucks that a lot of anime is going to be very weird

02:35:56.100 --> 02:35:57.980
and have very like obscure themes.

02:35:57.980 --> 02:36:00.380
And then people are like, this is disgusting.

02:36:01.500 --> 02:36:03.220
And it's like, even then, it's like, I could,

02:36:03.260 --> 02:36:04.460
there's some anime that I'm like, you know,

02:36:04.460 --> 02:36:05.860
that's a little too weird for my taste,

02:36:05.860 --> 02:36:08.100
but I'm not going to show people that, like,

02:36:08.100 --> 02:36:10.900
it's like the weird, like, puritan thing

02:36:10.900 --> 02:36:13.340
people have going on with, and like just the anime.

02:36:13.340 --> 02:36:14.300
Yeah.

02:36:14.300 --> 02:36:15.820
And then like, oh my God,

02:36:15.820 --> 02:36:17.820
so I could talk about this topic for hours.

02:36:17.820 --> 02:36:20.620
It's like a different kind of like,

02:36:20.620 --> 02:36:22.180
cause it's like initially, like it was like,

02:36:22.180 --> 02:36:23.980
oh, I feel embarrassed that I like this stuff

02:36:23.980 --> 02:36:26.060
because they're bullying me for liking anime.

02:36:26.060 --> 02:36:26.900
Yeah.

02:36:26.900 --> 02:36:29.660
But now that they know, it's like they have

02:36:29.660 --> 02:36:32.060
all these things to say, like, oh, this is wrong.

02:36:32.060 --> 02:36:34.620
You can't like this, but you can't like this.

02:36:34.620 --> 02:36:35.860
You can't like this, you can't like this.

02:36:35.860 --> 02:36:38.500
Like now that they're like, you know,

02:36:38.500 --> 02:36:40.220
they're more familiar with it.

02:36:40.220 --> 02:36:42.220
Yeah, they're dictating what's wrong.

02:36:42.220 --> 02:36:44.180
It's like, no, no, no, no.

02:36:44.180 --> 02:36:47.780
Happening with visual novels as well.

02:36:47.780 --> 02:36:50.020
I have noticed that I've seen some stuff.

02:36:50.020 --> 02:36:52.540
And it's really bad, cause in my opinion,

02:36:52.540 --> 02:36:54.700
visual novels is the one medium

02:36:54.700 --> 02:36:57.420
where people can be really weird.

02:36:57.420 --> 02:37:01.660
There are some really like weird, disturbing visual novels

02:37:01.740 --> 02:37:04.220
and people are like, oh, but the girls are cute,

02:37:04.220 --> 02:37:06.220
but this game is so icky and gross.

02:37:06.220 --> 02:37:07.460
You know, the place is weird.

02:37:07.460 --> 02:37:09.060
It's like, maybe you look into the characters

02:37:09.060 --> 02:37:11.180
before you're like, I'm in a cosplay-less character.

02:37:11.180 --> 02:37:12.020
Yeah.

02:37:12.900 --> 02:37:14.260
Saiyan Uta Kof Kof.

02:37:14.260 --> 02:37:15.620
I think Afumo is,

02:37:17.260 --> 02:37:19.740
Afumo should have never existed for Saiya.

02:37:21.100 --> 02:37:24.180
I know, I was, I saw seeing a lot about that

02:37:24.180 --> 02:37:27.340
on my timeline, just like Saiya blowing up and-

02:37:27.340 --> 02:37:30.540
Yeah, Saiya's blowing up and people that hate the things

02:37:30.540 --> 02:37:32.420
that Saiya talks about are like, I love Saiya.

02:37:32.420 --> 02:37:34.340
She's so cool.

02:37:34.340 --> 02:37:36.100
And it's like, you would not like the game,

02:37:36.100 --> 02:37:37.420
but it's okay.

02:37:38.340 --> 02:37:40.380
But then anime and VTuber are coming mainstream

02:37:40.380 --> 02:37:41.700
was a mistake.

02:37:42.700 --> 02:37:44.380
Gay keep it.

02:37:44.380 --> 02:37:45.700
Push the little show.

02:37:45.700 --> 02:37:47.540
Gay keep it, let's gay keep.

02:37:47.540 --> 02:37:48.740
It's like, I don't want to gay keep,

02:37:48.740 --> 02:37:50.180
cause it's like, I think it's fun to like

02:37:50.180 --> 02:37:51.620
see VTuber merge in public,

02:37:51.620 --> 02:37:53.340
but then it's like, it sucks when people are like,

02:37:53.340 --> 02:37:55.940
this VTuber isn't talking about these things.

02:37:55.940 --> 02:37:57.940
But VTuber does this thing, and it's like,

02:37:59.060 --> 02:37:59.900
you know.

02:38:00.020 --> 02:38:02.660
Everything feels so restricting, cause it's like,

02:38:02.660 --> 02:38:05.780
oh, I feel like I have these rules to follow.

02:38:05.780 --> 02:38:08.220
Or it's like, before I didn't feel like there was any rules,

02:38:08.220 --> 02:38:09.540
I could just be like-

02:38:09.540 --> 02:38:11.500
You need to be a little dork with other dorks

02:38:11.500 --> 02:38:12.860
and having fun.

02:38:12.860 --> 02:38:14.220
Be a little dork.

02:38:14.220 --> 02:38:15.060
Yeah.

02:38:15.060 --> 02:38:17.300
Yeah, you kind of put more under a microscope.

02:38:18.500 --> 02:38:20.020
She's getting a figure too.

02:38:20.020 --> 02:38:22.180
I know, that's like gonna be awful.

02:38:23.380 --> 02:38:25.540
Plus Saiya's getting a figure?

02:38:25.540 --> 02:38:27.940
Again, yeah, it's cause she got popular again.

02:38:29.940 --> 02:38:32.140
It's such a hell of a lot of love.

02:38:32.140 --> 02:38:33.860
It's such a hell of a lot of love.

02:38:33.860 --> 02:38:35.300
It's such a hell of a lot of love.

02:38:35.300 --> 02:38:36.700
It's such a hell of a lot of love.

02:38:36.700 --> 02:38:38.380
What, what, what, what?

02:38:38.380 --> 02:38:39.220
What, what, what?

02:38:39.220 --> 02:38:40.580
That's the part where we all just like make weird noises.

02:38:40.580 --> 02:38:41.500
Yeah, I know, I know.

02:38:41.500 --> 02:38:42.340
Oh, I know.

02:38:42.340 --> 02:38:45.340
I'm just very, I'm very passionate about my enemies

02:38:45.340 --> 02:38:47.380
and my enemies' topic.

02:38:47.380 --> 02:38:48.380
I don't know.

02:38:48.380 --> 02:38:50.300
So all your enemies, I like weird.

02:38:50.300 --> 02:38:53.460
Sunshine smiles, what about that?

02:38:53.460 --> 02:38:55.740
Yeah, it's true, like fruit baskets.

02:38:55.740 --> 02:38:56.580
Yeah!

02:38:56.580 --> 02:38:58.940
Would they want more in this world?

02:38:58.940 --> 02:39:01.620
No, they would want kindness and happiness.

02:39:01.620 --> 02:39:02.860
Aw.

02:39:02.860 --> 02:39:06.420
Happy, happy, smile, a little bunny cuteness.

02:39:06.420 --> 02:39:06.920
It's real.

02:39:06.920 --> 02:39:09.060
I watched Fritz basket in the longest time.

02:39:09.060 --> 02:39:12.580
I literally, somebody snapped me back in to remind me

02:39:12.580 --> 02:39:14.980
of like, Natalia acts as powers.

02:39:14.980 --> 02:39:16.420
And I was like, holy crap.

02:39:16.420 --> 02:39:18.380
Oh my god, Natalia!

02:39:18.380 --> 02:39:19.220
Yeah, I know, right?

02:39:19.220 --> 02:39:22.740
I think everyone can agree that Natalia did not age well.

02:39:22.740 --> 02:39:23.240
No!

02:39:23.240 --> 02:39:25.900
But Fritz could not admit that's one of the reasons.

02:39:25.900 --> 02:39:27.460
No one talks about it.

02:39:27.460 --> 02:39:31.020
Nobody, it's OK, it's fine.

02:39:31.020 --> 02:39:35.860
I think that, I was really happy that Fritz basket got it.

02:39:35.860 --> 02:39:38.260
Because Fritz basket was the first, like the original Fritz

02:39:38.260 --> 02:39:41.780
basket was the first anime I ever watched.

02:39:41.780 --> 02:39:44.500
So like, when I got a remake, I was really scared because I

02:39:44.500 --> 02:39:47.300
was like, I can mess this up so bad.

02:39:47.300 --> 02:39:48.140
I haven't watched the remake.

02:39:48.140 --> 02:39:50.020
Is it good?

02:39:50.020 --> 02:39:53.220
Yeah, I didn't watch the first season because I was like,

02:39:53.220 --> 02:39:56.260
well, I feel like I already knew everything that happened.

02:39:56.260 --> 02:39:58.220
But I watched the second season, third season,

02:39:58.220 --> 02:39:59.140
and it was so good.

02:39:59.140 --> 02:40:02.220
And I cried, and I was like, oh my god, happy.

02:40:02.220 --> 02:40:02.780
I have to watch it.

02:40:02.780 --> 02:40:04.540
It follows the manga a lot more.

02:40:04.540 --> 02:40:07.060
I do recommend it if you have the time.

02:40:07.060 --> 02:40:12.060
I will say, new romance anime for, OK.

02:40:12.060 --> 02:40:13.580
I think you guys want to understand more.

02:40:13.580 --> 02:40:15.780
Anime has become more for male, so it's

02:40:15.780 --> 02:40:19.380
very hard to get female-centered romance anime.

02:40:19.380 --> 02:40:20.620
Oh, like, so-so.

02:40:20.620 --> 02:40:22.940
Yes, because if it's for men, no offense,

02:40:22.940 --> 02:40:25.340
because there's some anime that are like, harrowing for guys.

02:40:25.340 --> 02:40:26.740
And I'm like, oh, this is so great.

02:40:26.740 --> 02:40:29.940
Like, 100 girlfriends that I really like you?

02:40:29.940 --> 02:40:30.820
Great anime.

02:40:30.820 --> 02:40:31.300
That was so cute.

02:40:31.300 --> 02:40:32.660
Please watch an anime.

02:40:32.660 --> 02:40:34.700
It's so good.

02:40:34.700 --> 02:40:37.300
But I feel like we need more anime like Futsu Baskets

02:40:37.300 --> 02:40:40.340
and Nana and Paradise Kiss for women.

02:40:40.340 --> 02:40:40.740
I know.

02:40:40.740 --> 02:40:41.700
That'll never happen.

02:40:41.700 --> 02:40:44.140
I feel like I wonder if we'll ever return.

02:40:44.140 --> 02:40:46.700
But then there's like, I feel like all the mangas that

02:40:46.700 --> 02:40:48.900
would be the same, they're not going to get adapted

02:40:48.900 --> 02:40:52.300
because they're so old and no one talks about them anymore.

02:40:52.300 --> 02:40:54.180
Or they're too small and obscure.

02:40:54.180 --> 02:40:57.980
They have no English translation, so it's no point.

02:40:57.980 --> 02:41:00.660
I'm reading your chat, but I'm not this and guys

02:41:00.660 --> 02:41:02.940
that like, show Joe, I don't, I think you misinterpreted.

02:41:02.940 --> 02:41:06.780
I'm saying not a lot of anime's art, like, for women,

02:41:06.780 --> 02:41:09.180
like, like, or on Host Club.

02:41:09.180 --> 02:41:09.940
I miss Aura.

02:41:09.940 --> 02:41:10.500
Things like that.

02:41:10.500 --> 02:41:10.940
Oh, my God.

02:41:10.940 --> 02:41:11.460
I miss Aura.

02:41:11.460 --> 02:41:12.860
I miss Aura.

02:41:12.860 --> 02:41:16.180
Peach Girl, like, we're missing, like, we're missing the female,

02:41:16.180 --> 02:41:18.180
like, for the female fans.

02:41:18.180 --> 02:41:22.500
And it's not the same.

02:41:22.500 --> 02:41:23.060
You know what I mean?

02:41:23.060 --> 02:41:25.180
You need some of the for the girlies, you know?

02:41:25.180 --> 02:41:25.940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:41:25.940 --> 02:41:27.140
That is really scary.

02:41:27.140 --> 02:41:31.220
Kimi ni todoke, it's the romance one.

02:41:31.220 --> 02:41:33.620
She has, like, long, straight, black hair.

02:41:33.620 --> 02:41:35.820
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

02:41:35.820 --> 02:41:37.140
What's that one about?

02:41:37.140 --> 02:41:38.380
Yes.

02:41:38.380 --> 02:41:41.780
I think she's like popular boy and she's like weird, scary girl,

02:41:41.780 --> 02:41:42.420
but they end up together.

02:41:42.420 --> 02:41:44.020
Oh, yes, I heard about that one.

02:41:44.020 --> 02:41:44.820
I haven't watched it though.

02:41:44.820 --> 02:41:47.220
It's literally the anime of fucking miscommunication.

02:41:47.220 --> 02:41:48.500
They're really, she's so mean.

02:41:48.500 --> 02:41:50.620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:41:50.620 --> 02:41:52.660
My dress of darling is such a guy anime.

02:41:52.660 --> 02:41:53.620
I am so sorry.

02:41:53.620 --> 02:41:55.620
Oh, yeah, that one has fanservice.

02:41:55.620 --> 02:41:56.700
Yeah, that's for guys.

02:41:56.700 --> 02:41:57.380
That one's like, yeah.

02:41:57.380 --> 02:42:00.220
So the difference between, oh my gosh, I look such a dork.

02:42:00.220 --> 02:42:02.820
The difference between female and male-centered animes

02:42:02.820 --> 02:42:07.220
is that male-centered animes will have a lot of, like,

02:42:07.220 --> 02:42:09.300
unnecessary fan service for the girls.

02:42:09.300 --> 02:42:11.540
And then, like, the girl ones are like,

02:42:11.540 --> 02:42:15.860
oh, holy shit, the beach episode is your fan service.

02:42:15.860 --> 02:42:18.340
But the beach episode is always, like, a part of the plot.

02:42:18.340 --> 02:42:21.020
Like, in Oron Coast Club, they go into, like, the little water

02:42:21.020 --> 02:42:22.620
park.

02:42:22.620 --> 02:42:24.420
Or, like, I think of, like, animes, like,

02:42:24.420 --> 02:42:25.860
do you guys remember Free?

02:42:25.860 --> 02:42:27.140
Like, that was, like, a big one.

02:42:27.140 --> 02:42:28.140
Yes.

02:42:28.140 --> 02:42:30.660
Free was supposed to be a yowie anime, by the way.

02:42:30.660 --> 02:42:33.060
Yeah, or, like, it played against it.

02:42:33.060 --> 02:42:35.180
It was, like, a tease the whole time.

02:42:35.180 --> 02:42:36.740
I remember fucking being obsessed with that.

02:42:36.740 --> 02:42:38.140
But it's, like, usually.

02:42:38.140 --> 02:42:38.740
Who did you ship?

02:42:38.740 --> 02:42:41.100
Was it Rin Haru or Mako Haru?

02:42:41.100 --> 02:42:42.980
Oh, no, yeah.

02:42:42.980 --> 02:42:44.140
What did you say?

02:42:44.140 --> 02:42:44.740
Both.

02:42:44.740 --> 02:42:45.220
Both?

02:42:45.220 --> 02:42:46.340
Yeah, I think I was Rin Haru.

02:42:46.340 --> 02:42:48.780
Oh, Nagisa on the blue-haired guy with the glasses.

02:42:48.780 --> 02:42:50.980
That was my, like, oh, chin.

02:42:51.940 --> 02:42:52.740
Wait, wait, wait.

02:42:52.740 --> 02:42:57.580
Who was your first character you shipped together?

02:42:57.580 --> 02:42:58.860
Wait, what'd you say?

02:42:58.860 --> 02:43:01.820
You're both first characters you shipped together.

02:43:01.820 --> 02:43:02.740
Like, in general.

02:43:02.740 --> 02:43:05.380
He could have caught him.

02:43:05.380 --> 02:43:06.380
Wait, what?

02:43:06.380 --> 02:43:07.740
He could have caught him?

02:43:07.740 --> 02:43:08.820
He could have caught him?

02:43:08.820 --> 02:43:09.780
Are you kidding?

02:43:09.780 --> 02:43:10.700
Oh, so true.

02:43:10.700 --> 02:43:11.180
That's a lie.

02:43:11.180 --> 02:43:13.460
Yeah, I'm glad you're right.

02:43:13.460 --> 02:43:15.460
I wanted you to ship them, though.

02:43:15.460 --> 02:43:18.220
Yeah, but they literally, like, sleep together naked.

02:43:18.220 --> 02:43:24.740
Listen, my young brain did not care.

02:43:24.740 --> 02:43:29.380
And, you know, Twinsist is Winsist.

02:43:29.380 --> 02:43:31.100
I do love that, I mean, I think it also

02:43:31.100 --> 02:43:32.300
eats pretty bad things.

02:43:32.300 --> 02:43:34.780
Oh, yeah, 100%.

02:43:34.780 --> 02:43:37.220
What about you, Chai?

02:43:37.220 --> 02:43:39.060
See it again?

02:43:39.060 --> 02:43:42.580
The first two characters you ever shipped together?

02:43:42.580 --> 02:43:47.140
First two characters I ever shipped together was Fruitsbasket.

02:43:47.140 --> 02:43:51.820
It would have been Yuki and Toru.

02:43:51.820 --> 02:43:52.780
OK, OK, OK.

02:43:52.780 --> 02:43:54.260
That's cute.

02:43:54.260 --> 02:43:59.340
And then Honey Senpai and Mori Senpai.

02:43:59.340 --> 02:44:00.020
Oh, yes.

02:44:00.020 --> 02:44:04.820
I also shipped a thousand, like, millions.

02:44:04.820 --> 02:44:06.340
I'm going to tell you mine.

02:44:06.340 --> 02:44:08.420
And this is the reason why I asked this question,

02:44:08.420 --> 02:44:09.660
because mine's is really bad.

02:44:09.660 --> 02:44:10.260
OK.

02:44:10.260 --> 02:44:10.900
I want to know.

02:44:10.900 --> 02:44:14.420
So mine's was SpongeBob and Squidward.

02:44:14.420 --> 02:44:16.780
Oh, we're going that far back?

02:44:17.220 --> 02:44:19.540
Oh, I thought we were in the context of anime.

02:44:19.540 --> 02:44:22.100
Oh, no, no, I said first, not anime.

02:44:22.100 --> 02:44:23.100
Anime is different.

02:44:23.100 --> 02:44:25.540
Anime, mine's was SpongeBob and Squidward.

02:44:25.540 --> 02:44:27.020
Mine's was going crazy.

02:44:27.020 --> 02:44:28.540
They're very confused.

02:44:28.540 --> 02:44:31.180
And I would always draw them kissing.

02:44:31.180 --> 02:44:34.900
And I would, like, follow Japanese artists and, like,

02:44:34.900 --> 02:44:35.500
things like that.

02:44:35.500 --> 02:44:40.060
And then I went down the Tom and Jerry

02:44:40.060 --> 02:44:42.180
pipeline of, like, Japanese artists.

02:44:42.180 --> 02:44:47.020
And they still draw them together until this day.

02:44:47.020 --> 02:44:48.540
SquidBob.

02:44:48.540 --> 02:44:51.340
Yeah, I was like, SquidBob or SpongeWade.

02:44:51.340 --> 02:44:54.340
Mine, if it wasn't anime related, I'm like.

02:44:54.340 --> 02:44:55.620
It's just any media.

02:44:55.620 --> 02:44:57.740
Any media that you, like, consumed so much,

02:44:57.740 --> 02:44:58.940
there was, like, yeah.

02:44:58.940 --> 02:45:02.740
I'm like, was it, like, Starfire and Raven?

02:45:02.740 --> 02:45:04.340
From Teen Titans, I don't know.

02:45:04.340 --> 02:45:07.180
Oh, that's good, that's good.

02:45:07.180 --> 02:45:08.660
Yeah, I can't recall.

02:45:08.660 --> 02:45:12.020
I'm too old for that at the age of 56.

02:45:12.020 --> 02:45:15.180
Damn, sorry.

02:45:15.180 --> 02:45:17.420
Cosmo and Timmy.

02:45:17.420 --> 02:45:19.780
You know, I see, I was thinking that, too.

02:45:19.780 --> 02:45:21.700
Like, first, when I was trying to think back,

02:45:21.700 --> 02:45:23.180
I'm like, was that Cosmo?

02:45:23.180 --> 02:45:25.860
Oh, yeah, Cosmo and Timmy, I think.

02:45:25.860 --> 02:45:27.940
No, I got to think about that hard.

02:45:27.940 --> 02:45:30.900
I feel like I wasn't, like, in the shipping mindset.

02:45:30.900 --> 02:45:32.940
I was just like, yeah, TV on my screen.

02:45:32.940 --> 02:45:34.260
TV on my screen.

02:45:34.260 --> 02:45:38.060
I can tell you what moment made me ship them together.

02:45:38.060 --> 02:45:38.540
Please tell me.

02:45:38.540 --> 02:45:39.300
I know exactly.

02:45:39.300 --> 02:45:40.140
It's so bad.

02:45:40.140 --> 02:45:45.540
So when SpongeBob finds him eating a crabby patty,

02:45:45.540 --> 02:45:47.540
and he's like, you like them, don't you screw him.

02:45:47.540 --> 02:45:49.860
He's going on fairies with Lesley.

02:45:49.860 --> 02:45:51.700
Oh, yes, I remember this one.

02:45:51.700 --> 02:45:54.620
I was in, like, my anime phase, so I saw that,

02:45:54.620 --> 02:45:58.660
and I was like, yeah, this is peak.

02:45:58.660 --> 02:46:01.340
This is my OTP.

02:46:01.340 --> 02:46:07.300
Yeah, this is my OTP, and I have, like, a fan page for them.

02:46:07.300 --> 02:46:10.340
My friend Kumi, she's in chat right now,

02:46:10.340 --> 02:46:13.180
and she said Mr. Krabson Plankton.

02:46:13.180 --> 02:46:14.940
Oh, that's a good one.

02:46:14.940 --> 02:46:17.100
That's a really good one.

02:46:17.100 --> 02:46:20.460
But, no, it wasn't the inflation part.

02:46:20.460 --> 02:46:21.460
It wasn't when he was fat.

02:46:21.460 --> 02:46:23.220
It was like, he was just, like, eating it,

02:46:23.220 --> 02:46:25.860
and he was like, oh, you like them, don't you screw him.

02:46:25.860 --> 02:46:27.060
He's like, no, I don't.

02:46:27.060 --> 02:46:28.620
And then I thought of, like, an anime

02:46:28.620 --> 02:46:30.620
where they, like, kabadon each other.

02:46:30.620 --> 02:46:32.020
And then, you know, last year, I was like, oh, my god,

02:46:32.020 --> 02:46:36.020
what did SpongeBob was kabadoning fucking Squidward?

02:46:36.020 --> 02:46:37.340
Oh, my god.

02:46:37.340 --> 02:46:38.540
Wait, you remember?

02:46:38.540 --> 02:46:41.020
There was that one scene where it's like,

02:46:41.020 --> 02:46:43.100
SpongeBob says bye Squidward twice,

02:46:43.100 --> 02:46:44.860
and he's like, yeah, I like Squidward.

02:46:44.860 --> 02:46:46.460
He's like, I like Squidward.

02:46:46.460 --> 02:46:50.140
Like, I like Squidward, I'm telling you,

02:46:50.140 --> 02:46:53.220
they didn't even mention Squidward, so.

02:46:53.220 --> 02:46:55.260
They teased it.

02:46:55.260 --> 02:46:56.300
I loved it.

02:46:56.300 --> 02:46:57.660
I don't know, I had, like, I don't know,

02:46:57.660 --> 02:46:59.540
I was like, I was just a crack ship.

02:46:59.540 --> 02:47:02.140
Yeah, I was like, yeah, I was just a crack ship.

02:47:02.140 --> 02:47:05.620
Yeah, Gojo and Cinderella is the one that's like a thing.

02:47:05.620 --> 02:47:07.340
Yeah, that's a thing.

02:47:07.340 --> 02:47:08.180
How the fuck is that?

02:47:08.180 --> 02:47:09.020
I don't know why.

02:47:09.020 --> 02:47:10.180
I don't know, what?

02:47:10.180 --> 02:47:11.020
Wait, no.

02:47:11.020 --> 02:47:13.020
What's the bikini bottom horror?

02:47:13.020 --> 02:47:15.020
Someone said blame Sheebie.

02:47:15.020 --> 02:47:16.540
What's the bikini?

02:47:16.540 --> 02:47:18.020
Oh, Sheebie, sheebie deal.

02:47:18.020 --> 02:47:20.140
I don't know what they mean by that.

02:47:20.140 --> 02:47:24.140
Oh, oh, it's not your fault, it's just your fault.

02:47:24.140 --> 02:47:26.140
It's just my fault.

02:47:26.140 --> 02:47:27.340
No, wait, I got it wrong.

02:47:27.340 --> 02:47:31.900
It's Sakuna and Cinderella, and then it's Gojo and Elsa.

02:47:31.900 --> 02:47:34.420
Elsa, I was gonna say it's 100% Elsa

02:47:34.420 --> 02:47:35.260
because they like math.

02:47:35.260 --> 02:47:38.900
It's Elsa, yeah, but Sakuna and Cinderella, I don't know.

02:47:38.900 --> 02:47:39.740
Gojo and Cinderella.

02:47:39.740 --> 02:47:41.220
Although, I do like those random edits

02:47:41.220 --> 02:47:44.540
where they'll splice a bunch of Disney cartoons together

02:47:44.540 --> 02:47:45.380
and TikTok.

02:47:45.380 --> 02:47:47.420
Do you know, like, Vima, Bad Boy, Vima, Vima, Vima, Vima.

02:47:47.420 --> 02:47:49.340
Yeah, baby, get it.

02:47:49.340 --> 02:47:52.940
I think there's some shrek in someone from El Dorado

02:47:52.940 --> 02:47:55.540
or something, I don't even fucking know.

02:47:55.540 --> 02:47:57.060
Wait, what's El Dorado?

02:47:57.060 --> 02:48:02.940
It's an old, lesser known Disney movie, animated movie.

02:48:02.940 --> 02:48:05.780
You would probably like it, The Road to El Dorado.

02:48:05.780 --> 02:48:06.620
Yeah, I know it.

02:48:06.620 --> 02:48:08.100
Because you're Spanish.

02:48:08.100 --> 02:48:09.460
OK, thanks.

02:48:09.460 --> 02:48:13.580
Ash, Ash, catch them in Sky from Paw Patrol.

02:48:13.580 --> 02:48:14.740
Oh, it's DreamWorks.

02:48:14.740 --> 02:48:17.020
This Sky of Dog?

02:48:17.020 --> 02:48:18.460
Sky's a dog.

02:48:18.460 --> 02:48:20.460
What?

02:48:20.460 --> 02:48:23.660
You don't know El Dorado?

02:48:23.660 --> 02:48:24.660
Sorry, DreamWorks.

02:48:24.660 --> 02:48:27.380
Next could be something you should compare and deal.

02:48:27.380 --> 02:48:30.620
I did ship Gojo and Dio when I watched it,

02:48:30.620 --> 02:48:31.660
but I thought it was a great ship.

02:48:31.660 --> 02:48:33.140
How could you not?

02:48:33.140 --> 02:48:35.220
Yeah, I did, too.

02:48:35.220 --> 02:48:38.420
I always love enemies to lovers.

02:48:38.420 --> 02:48:40.820
In real life, though, that'd be fucking insufferable,

02:48:40.820 --> 02:48:42.180
but enemies to lovers, right?

02:48:42.180 --> 02:48:42.860
Yeah.

02:48:42.860 --> 02:48:44.140
Or rivals to lovers.

02:48:44.140 --> 02:48:44.660
I like that.

02:48:44.660 --> 02:48:50.060
Like, that's a more realistic trope, in my opinion.

02:48:50.060 --> 02:48:51.220
Sky is a dog.

02:48:51.220 --> 02:48:52.500
What do you mean it would make more sun?

02:48:52.500 --> 02:48:52.980
Shut up.

02:48:52.980 --> 02:48:53.660
Wait, what?

02:48:53.660 --> 02:48:55.500
I missed that part of it.

02:48:55.500 --> 02:48:58.340
She looked up Ash, catch them in Sky from Paw Patrol.

02:48:58.340 --> 02:48:59.500
Ash, catch them in Sky.

02:48:59.500 --> 02:49:00.340
Nothing came up.

02:49:00.380 --> 02:49:02.300
I think that's just their personal ship.

02:49:02.300 --> 02:49:02.780
What?

02:49:02.780 --> 02:49:03.900
That's just their personal.

02:49:03.900 --> 02:49:05.380
That's just their own thing.

02:49:05.380 --> 02:49:05.860
That's it.

02:49:05.860 --> 02:49:06.900
Yeah, that's their own.

02:49:06.900 --> 02:49:08.260
What the fuck?

02:49:08.260 --> 02:49:08.740
You freak.

02:49:08.740 --> 02:49:09.980
Is this a pinkish dog?

02:49:09.980 --> 02:49:10.980
Or like, has paint on it?

02:49:10.980 --> 02:49:12.460
Yeah, that's a girl dog, I think.

02:49:12.460 --> 02:49:13.940
Oh, my god.

02:49:13.940 --> 02:49:16.300
The only girl dog on the team.

02:49:16.300 --> 02:49:19.140
Stuart Little in Wreck-It-Row.

02:49:19.140 --> 02:49:19.660
Oh, my god.

02:49:19.660 --> 02:49:22.980
I had a huge crush on Stuart Little.

02:49:22.980 --> 02:49:24.580
I had a really big crush on Stuart Little.

02:49:24.580 --> 02:49:25.340
No, I made Stuart Little.

02:49:25.340 --> 02:49:26.340
I ate him, I ate him, I ate him.

02:49:26.340 --> 02:49:28.940
I think it says, like, in my brain, in my brain,

02:49:28.940 --> 02:49:30.740
I was like, nerdy white guy, you know,

02:49:30.740 --> 02:49:33.660
brown women attracted to a white man.

02:49:33.660 --> 02:49:35.220
That's cool, lead balls.

02:49:35.220 --> 02:49:37.460
No, I ain't doing it, I don't hate him.

02:49:37.460 --> 02:49:39.580
I have to look up these movies in Spanish,

02:49:39.580 --> 02:49:42.180
because I don't know what that, I treasure planet.

02:49:42.180 --> 02:49:42.620
What is that?

02:49:42.620 --> 02:49:45.620
I hate Stuart Little for trying to put a deep, rooted

02:49:45.620 --> 02:49:47.300
personal reason.

02:49:47.300 --> 02:49:47.780
Why?

02:49:47.780 --> 02:49:49.220
I know.

02:49:49.220 --> 02:49:51.380
I also, I could tell you guys.

02:49:51.380 --> 02:49:53.500
I don't like Stuart Little because I remember watching

02:49:53.500 --> 02:49:56.580
Mouse Hunt, and I hated the Mouse and Mouse Hunt.

02:49:56.620 --> 02:49:59.940
And then, Stuart Little was also a Mouse, so.

02:49:59.940 --> 02:50:01.100
That's fair.

02:50:01.100 --> 02:50:03.860
See, somebody, I watched in Spanish.

02:50:03.860 --> 02:50:06.340
When I see the English child, I have to Google them,

02:50:06.340 --> 02:50:08.500
because I don't know what that means.

02:50:08.500 --> 02:50:09.340
Why they do that?

02:50:09.340 --> 02:50:13.100
Wait, what about Reckon Ralph's ex-fixit Felix?

02:50:13.100 --> 02:50:14.100
I shit that.

02:50:14.100 --> 02:50:15.860
Well, that's just, yeah, that's just, like, you know, again.

02:50:15.860 --> 02:50:16.900
Like, I had a rival.

02:50:16.900 --> 02:50:20.100
I like the, yeah, rivals under me.

02:50:20.100 --> 02:50:22.700
It was funny, though, because he was, like, Ralph.

02:50:22.700 --> 02:50:24.180
They weren't even mean to each other.

02:50:24.180 --> 02:50:27.060
They were just, like, hey, Ralph, you just can't hang out here.

02:50:27.060 --> 02:50:29.460
You break everything.

02:50:29.460 --> 02:50:35.060
Wait, Reckon Ralph ex-merida from Brave is, like, a real chip.

02:50:35.060 --> 02:50:35.860
It's a real chip.

02:50:35.860 --> 02:50:41.460
If you had the chance to change your fate, would ya?

02:50:41.460 --> 02:50:44.380
Oh, yes, I fucking love Treasure Planets.

02:50:44.380 --> 02:50:46.860
OK, why did you give the cat lady to the fat ass?

02:50:46.860 --> 02:50:48.540
Is this, like, an actual thing?

02:50:48.540 --> 02:50:51.380
She doesn't have a fat ass in the movie,

02:50:51.380 --> 02:50:52.380
but that's pretty cool.

02:50:52.380 --> 02:50:53.380
Yeah, I like that image.

02:50:53.380 --> 02:50:55.380
I like how she's turning around.

02:50:55.380 --> 02:50:59.380
OK, I'm like, like, they just made her ass so big.

02:50:59.380 --> 02:51:00.380
Like, why?

02:51:00.380 --> 02:51:02.380
Like, in the group chat, I looked up Treasure Planets.

02:51:02.380 --> 02:51:03.380
I was looking for things I saw.

02:51:03.380 --> 02:51:04.380
Why is her butt cheeks so big?

02:51:04.380 --> 02:51:07.380
I own Treasure Planet on DVD.

02:51:07.380 --> 02:51:09.380
I'm pretty proud of that.

02:51:09.380 --> 02:51:11.380
Oh, my gosh.

02:51:11.380 --> 02:51:13.380
That's a pretty good reaction.

02:51:13.380 --> 02:51:15.380
Reckon's rerun?

02:51:15.380 --> 02:51:16.380
That's a thing.

02:51:16.380 --> 02:51:18.380
Is there art of that?

02:51:18.380 --> 02:51:19.380
I was looking it up.

02:51:20.380 --> 02:51:22.380
How about Freerun?

02:51:22.380 --> 02:51:25.380
No, if I did Freerun X, it's just going to be Himmel.

02:51:25.380 --> 02:51:26.380
I own it on VHS.

02:51:26.380 --> 02:51:30.380
I don't think it ever was on VHS.

02:51:30.380 --> 02:51:32.380
Oh, it's a, oh, yeah.

02:51:32.380 --> 02:51:36.380
I remember that little meme, the little meme.

02:51:36.380 --> 02:51:38.380
I don't understand what's happening now in English.

02:51:38.380 --> 02:51:40.380
My brain's trying to understand this fucking English language.

02:51:40.380 --> 02:51:41.380
Oh, my god.

02:51:41.380 --> 02:51:42.380
Look at this.

02:51:42.380 --> 02:51:43.380
Everyone, look it.

02:51:43.380 --> 02:51:44.380
Shrek X Freerun.

02:51:44.380 --> 02:51:45.380
They're crazy.

02:51:45.380 --> 02:51:46.380
That's a thing?

02:51:46.380 --> 02:51:47.380
Wait, can you post?

02:51:47.380 --> 02:51:48.380
Yeah, you know, there's, like, yeah.

02:51:48.380 --> 02:51:50.380
Oh, yeah, I can post it.

02:51:50.380 --> 02:51:52.380
It's all you have on your stream.

02:51:52.380 --> 02:51:53.380
I just logged it.

02:51:53.380 --> 02:51:54.380
There's this art.

02:51:54.380 --> 02:51:56.380
Wait, no, no, no.

02:51:56.380 --> 02:51:57.380
Ignore that photo.

02:51:57.380 --> 02:51:58.380
Ignore that.

02:51:58.380 --> 02:51:59.380
Ignore that.

02:51:59.380 --> 02:52:00.380
Ignore that.

02:52:00.380 --> 02:52:01.380
Ignore that.

02:52:01.380 --> 02:52:02.380
Ignore that.

02:52:02.380 --> 02:52:03.380
Ignore that.

02:52:03.380 --> 02:52:05.380
They just sent a white one in a very blue.

02:52:05.380 --> 02:52:07.380
Mine's the color of a bubble.

02:52:07.380 --> 02:52:09.380
It's really blue.

02:52:09.380 --> 02:52:10.380
Ignore it.

02:52:10.380 --> 02:52:11.380
Ignore that.

02:52:11.380 --> 02:52:12.380
Okay, look at this.

02:52:12.380 --> 02:52:14.380
Oh, that's actually pretty good art.

02:52:14.380 --> 02:52:15.380
Is he picking her up?

02:52:15.380 --> 02:52:17.380
I don't like that.

02:52:17.380 --> 02:52:19.380
Her Shrek is super short.

02:52:19.380 --> 02:52:21.380
Do you think she would like Shrek?

02:52:21.380 --> 02:52:23.380
I think she would love Shrek.

02:52:23.380 --> 02:52:24.380
I think she'd be.

02:52:24.380 --> 02:52:29.380
Yeah, honestly, I think she would actually have a thing for him.

02:52:29.380 --> 02:52:30.380
Oh, my gosh.

02:52:30.380 --> 02:52:32.380
You should get art of you and Shrek, CB.

02:52:32.380 --> 02:52:33.380
How about no?

02:52:33.380 --> 02:52:37.380
All right, so I'm going to draw art of you and Shrek together.

02:52:37.380 --> 02:52:42.380
Wait, do you guys have, like, a fictional character, like, like, crush that you, like,

02:52:42.380 --> 02:52:45.380
push to be, like, silly and wacky?

02:52:46.380 --> 02:52:48.380
Akira from Persona 5.

02:52:48.380 --> 02:52:50.380
I actually don't.

02:52:50.380 --> 02:52:51.380
I don't, I don't know.

02:52:51.380 --> 02:52:53.380
Do you guys want to shit me with somebody?

02:52:53.380 --> 02:52:55.380
Asking my, asking my hair.

02:52:55.380 --> 02:52:56.380
Let me think.

02:52:56.380 --> 02:52:57.380
What?

02:52:57.380 --> 02:52:58.380
Oh, I know who I would shit you with.

02:52:58.380 --> 02:52:59.380
I would shit, okay.

02:52:59.380 --> 02:53:02.380
Wait, do you like, what kind of man do you like?

02:53:02.380 --> 02:53:03.380
Do I continue?

02:53:03.380 --> 02:53:04.380
Donkey, Donkey from Shrek.

02:53:04.380 --> 02:53:05.380
Donkey?

02:53:05.380 --> 02:53:07.380
You want to shit me with Donkey?

02:53:07.380 --> 02:53:08.380
I can see you.

02:53:08.380 --> 02:53:10.380
I don't like that at all.

02:53:10.380 --> 02:53:13.380
You don't have the dragon that he, like, marries?

02:53:13.380 --> 02:53:14.380
Oh, it's true.

02:53:14.380 --> 02:53:17.380
I'm the dragon from Shrek.

02:53:17.380 --> 02:53:18.380
I do like you guys.

02:53:18.380 --> 02:53:20.380
I like guys who are funny.

02:53:20.380 --> 02:53:21.380
That is true.

02:53:21.380 --> 02:53:25.380
The main character from Golden Boy would love she be so much said in my chat.

02:53:25.380 --> 02:53:27.380
Who, from Golden Boy?

02:53:27.380 --> 02:53:28.380
Oh, yeah.

02:53:28.380 --> 02:53:30.380
What is that?

02:53:30.380 --> 02:53:31.380
It's a little old.

02:53:31.380 --> 02:53:32.380
It's an anime, but some wacky.

02:53:32.380 --> 02:53:33.380
It's wacky.

02:53:33.380 --> 02:53:35.380
Okay, I'll have to look that up.

02:53:35.380 --> 02:53:37.380
But mine is Akira from Persona 5.

02:53:37.380 --> 02:53:41.380
I think guys are really fluffier and glasses really, like, get me going.

02:53:41.380 --> 02:53:45.380
So, Senpai from Nagatoru.

02:53:45.380 --> 02:53:49.380
I hate Nagatoru, but I, like, love Senpai from Nagatoru.

02:53:49.380 --> 02:53:50.380
I think he's so cute.

02:53:50.380 --> 02:53:51.380
He is a cutie pie.

02:53:51.380 --> 02:53:53.380
Oh, floppy hair glasses.

02:53:53.380 --> 02:53:56.380
Like, floppy hair glasses.

02:53:56.380 --> 02:54:00.380
Oh, but right now, the love of my life.

02:54:00.380 --> 02:54:04.380
Right now, the love of my life is Chilchuk from Dungeon Meshie.

02:54:04.380 --> 02:54:05.380
I'm so in love with him.

02:54:05.380 --> 02:54:07.380
You're, what a weirdo you are.

02:54:07.380 --> 02:54:09.380
You got me here.

02:54:09.380 --> 02:54:10.380
I'm trying to think.

02:54:10.380 --> 02:54:14.380
I haven't, I haven't been watching a lot of, like, animated stuff lately.

02:54:14.380 --> 02:54:17.380
I've, I've, I've been watching, like, the boys.

02:54:17.380 --> 02:54:18.380
Nice.

02:54:18.380 --> 02:54:19.380
Chilchuk, too.

02:54:19.380 --> 02:54:24.380
I like, I like guys with blue, spiky hair.

02:54:24.380 --> 02:54:25.380
What?

02:54:25.380 --> 02:54:26.380
Sonic?

02:54:26.380 --> 02:54:27.380
I'm like.

02:54:27.380 --> 02:54:28.380
Oh, yeah, that's right.

02:54:28.380 --> 02:54:29.380
You like Sonic.

02:54:29.380 --> 02:54:30.380
Red shoes.

02:54:30.380 --> 02:54:31.380
Sonic?

02:54:31.380 --> 02:54:32.380
Yeah.

02:54:32.380 --> 02:54:33.380
Oh, my gosh.

02:54:33.380 --> 02:54:35.380
I mean, like, that's just, like, one, you know.

02:54:35.380 --> 02:54:37.380
He doesn't have to be Sonic.

02:54:37.380 --> 02:54:39.380
I don't care if he's Mary.

02:54:39.380 --> 02:54:42.380
He's going to, we're going to, he likes blonde hair.

02:54:42.380 --> 02:54:43.380
She's the other one.

02:54:43.380 --> 02:54:47.380
I'm going to dye my hair blonde and he's going to fall in love with me.

02:54:47.380 --> 02:54:49.380
I will, I will be married to Chilchuk.

02:54:49.380 --> 02:54:51.380
Wait, who likes blonde?

02:54:51.380 --> 02:54:53.380
Chilchuk Tim's likes blonde women.

02:54:53.380 --> 02:54:54.380
Chibi and Johnny Bravo.

02:54:54.380 --> 02:54:56.380
You know, I would approve that.

02:54:56.380 --> 02:54:57.380
Johnny?

02:54:57.380 --> 02:54:58.380
Yeah, that works.

02:54:58.380 --> 02:55:00.380
Johnny Bravo.

02:55:00.380 --> 02:55:01.380
Oh.

02:55:01.380 --> 02:55:02.380
Who would they choose me?

02:55:02.380 --> 02:55:03.380
Who would they pick me?

02:55:03.380 --> 02:55:04.380
Who would they pick me?

02:55:04.380 --> 02:55:06.380
Who would you, who would you ship with Chai?

02:55:06.380 --> 02:55:07.380
Who would you ship with?

02:55:07.380 --> 02:55:10.380
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I.

02:55:10.380 --> 02:55:11.380
What the fuck?

02:55:11.380 --> 02:55:12.380
She broke.

02:55:12.380 --> 02:55:16.380
I just wanted to, like, give them something to, like, inspire them.

02:55:16.380 --> 02:55:20.380
Wait, are you saying Poe from Kung Fu Panda for me?

02:55:20.380 --> 02:55:23.380
Because he's funny and makes food, you know, honestly.

02:55:23.380 --> 02:55:27.380
Johnny Bravo is my Chibi, absolutely.

02:55:27.380 --> 02:55:29.380
Yeah, I see Johnny Bravo.

02:55:29.380 --> 02:55:30.380
I do see that.

02:55:30.380 --> 02:55:32.380
Yeah, me and Johnny Bravo.

02:55:32.380 --> 02:55:40.380
Do you know the guy that plays the Riddler in, in the Batman, in the 2020 Batman movie?

02:55:40.380 --> 02:55:41.380
Yeah.

02:55:41.380 --> 02:55:43.380
This is weirdly specific.

02:55:43.380 --> 02:55:44.380
Yes.

02:55:44.380 --> 02:55:45.380
With Robert Pattison.

02:55:45.380 --> 02:55:46.380
You know, no.

02:55:46.380 --> 02:55:50.380
Paul, they know, but when he's specific with the Riddler.

02:55:50.380 --> 02:55:51.380
What the fuck is his name?

02:55:51.380 --> 02:55:52.380
I'm really into him.

02:55:52.380 --> 02:55:55.380
I think Robert Pattison was sexy in that one.

02:55:55.380 --> 02:55:56.380
Chibi X-Bugs Bunny.

02:55:56.380 --> 02:55:59.380
No, that's, that's bad.

02:55:59.380 --> 02:56:01.380
He's possibly my father.

02:56:01.380 --> 02:56:02.380
Wow.

02:56:02.380 --> 02:56:03.380
Oh, wait.

02:56:03.380 --> 02:56:04.380
Oh.

02:56:04.380 --> 02:56:05.380
What's your dad?

02:56:05.380 --> 02:56:10.380
I'm also, I'm canonically related to every bunny character in pop culture.

02:56:10.380 --> 02:56:11.380
Oh.

02:56:11.380 --> 02:56:13.380
Yeah, Paul Dano is, I know.

02:56:13.380 --> 02:56:14.380
Peter Rabbit.

02:56:14.380 --> 02:56:15.380
He's, he's something.

02:56:15.380 --> 02:56:18.380
I also like crazy fucked up characters.

02:56:18.380 --> 02:56:20.380
So that's why I fucking.

02:56:20.380 --> 02:56:21.380
Omelette?

02:56:21.380 --> 02:56:23.380
I, yeah, I had a thing for.

02:56:23.380 --> 02:56:24.380
Omelette?

02:56:24.380 --> 02:56:26.380
Yeah, I figure it doesn't much.

02:56:26.380 --> 02:56:28.380
Would you let him drink your Chichi's milk?

02:56:28.380 --> 02:56:29.380
Yeah.

02:56:29.380 --> 02:56:31.380
I milk him from a Zura.

02:56:31.380 --> 02:56:32.380
Homelander?

02:56:32.380 --> 02:56:34.380
First season homelander.

02:56:34.380 --> 02:56:36.380
I don't, not, not later seasons.

02:56:36.380 --> 02:56:39.380
Well, I'm a homelander.

02:56:39.380 --> 02:56:44.380
Oh no, Chibi, not homelander.

02:56:44.380 --> 02:56:48.380
I don't, I think it's like the, I can fix him thing.

02:56:48.380 --> 02:56:50.380
Like, I'm like, oh, I let me mother you.

02:56:50.380 --> 02:56:52.380
Like, I just want to take care of you.

02:56:52.380 --> 02:56:56.380
Like, I like, I like to fix people.

02:56:56.380 --> 02:56:57.380
I'm a fixer.

02:56:57.380 --> 02:56:58.380
I have to stop watching it.

02:56:58.380 --> 02:57:02.380
Cause I think once I saw the deep ass cheeks, I like tabbed out my brain.

02:57:02.380 --> 02:57:06.380
Wait, I need to know more.

02:57:06.380 --> 02:57:07.380
Tell me more.

02:57:07.380 --> 02:57:13.380
So the boys has a lot of nudity and there was one time he like makes a person blow him

02:57:13.380 --> 02:57:20.380
and then my, my, my mommy, my mommy walked into my room and then she walks in, his butt

02:57:20.380 --> 02:57:27.380
she's on my screen and I just felt ashamed.

02:57:27.380 --> 02:57:31.380
Yes, I would be Omniman's little pet.

02:57:31.380 --> 02:57:33.380
Yeah, I bet you were, you freak.

02:57:33.380 --> 02:57:36.380
I'll have another rare crush, but it's like from a really specific movie.

02:57:36.380 --> 02:57:41.380
And it's like the way that what happens to the character is very bad.

02:57:41.380 --> 02:57:43.380
The fucked up characters.

02:57:43.380 --> 02:57:44.380
Yeah.

02:57:44.380 --> 02:57:45.380
Nori at turbo.

02:57:45.380 --> 02:57:47.380
Oh, I see that.

02:57:47.380 --> 02:57:48.380
The snail.

02:57:48.380 --> 02:57:51.380
I love that movie.

02:57:51.380 --> 02:57:56.380

02:58:01.380 --> 02:58:02.380
I love YouTubers.

02:58:02.380 --> 02:58:03.380
That's true.

02:58:03.380 --> 02:58:07.380
Maybe I can get John Cena to follow me and I can, you know, hang out with Peacemaker.

02:58:07.380 --> 02:58:08.380
Mmm.

02:58:08.380 --> 02:58:09.380
Mmm.

02:58:09.380 --> 02:58:11.380

02:58:11.380 --> 02:58:13.380
Oh, Chi X Hiccup.

02:58:13.380 --> 02:58:14.380

I think Hiccup is so cute.

02:58:17.380 --> 02:58:18.380
I didn't give it a go.

02:58:18.380 --> 02:58:19.380

02:58:19.380 --> 02:58:21.380
I love how to train your dragon.

02:58:21.380 --> 02:58:22.380

I don't know what that's.

02:58:27.380 --> 02:58:28.380
I think that's exactly my type.

02:58:28.380 --> 02:58:29.380
Like tall.

02:58:29.380 --> 02:58:30.380
Why not?

02:58:30.380 --> 02:58:34.380
To be a big ears and messy hair.

02:58:34.380 --> 02:58:38.380
I like mentally ill or deep and brooding.

02:58:38.380 --> 02:58:41.380
And that's why I had a huge crush on Robin.

02:58:41.380 --> 02:58:42.380
Yeah.

02:58:42.380 --> 02:58:46.380
I like either really like fucked up mentally ill guys are like guys that literally look

02:58:46.380 --> 02:58:47.380
like they're like crack head teeth.

02:58:47.380 --> 02:58:48.380
Yeah.

02:58:48.380 --> 02:58:49.380
I don't know.

02:58:49.380 --> 02:58:50.380
It just gets me going.

02:58:50.380 --> 02:58:51.380
You guys.

02:58:51.380 --> 02:58:53.380
Who's your ideal man?

02:58:53.380 --> 02:58:54.380
Chi.

02:58:54.380 --> 02:58:58.380
Which is your favorite trope that you're attracted to?

02:58:58.380 --> 02:59:07.380
Um, charismatic and like, um, really fast.

02:59:07.380 --> 02:59:08.380
Okay.

02:59:08.380 --> 02:59:09.380
Okay.

02:59:09.380 --> 02:59:10.380
Let me think.

02:59:10.380 --> 02:59:11.380
I don't even know you guys.

02:59:11.380 --> 02:59:12.380
It's okay.

02:59:12.380 --> 02:59:13.380
You can just keep saying Sonic.

02:59:13.380 --> 02:59:14.380
It's okay.

02:59:14.380 --> 02:59:16.380
But I will be on my stand completely.

02:59:16.380 --> 02:59:19.380
100%.

02:59:19.380 --> 02:59:22.380
Nori X fish legs.

02:59:22.380 --> 02:59:24.380
No, it's just.

02:59:24.380 --> 02:59:27.380
I do like British accents.

02:59:27.380 --> 02:59:28.380
Not Batman.

02:59:28.380 --> 02:59:31.380
I like Robert Pattinson's Batman.

02:59:31.380 --> 02:59:32.380
He was good.

02:59:32.380 --> 02:59:34.380
I think, I think realistically.

02:59:34.380 --> 02:59:35.380
I don't know.

02:59:35.380 --> 02:59:36.380
Really.

02:59:36.380 --> 02:59:39.380
Actually, I lied about why it could be any skin color.

02:59:39.380 --> 02:59:40.380
Yeah.

02:59:40.380 --> 02:59:41.380
Fucked up teeth and big ears.

02:59:41.380 --> 02:59:42.380
I'm kind of into it.

02:59:42.380 --> 02:59:45.380
But then my first question is super deep.

02:59:45.380 --> 02:59:46.380
I don't know.

02:59:46.380 --> 02:59:49.380
My first cartoon crush was the cat baron from the cat returns.

02:59:49.380 --> 02:59:52.380
And then I fell in love with howl from howl's we've been castles.

02:59:52.380 --> 02:59:54.380
So I don't know what that means about me.

02:59:54.380 --> 02:59:56.380
What does that even mean about you?

02:59:56.380 --> 02:59:57.380
I don't know.

02:59:57.380 --> 02:59:58.380
I'm sorry.

02:59:58.380 --> 02:59:59.380
I'm sorry.

02:59:59.380 --> 03:00:00.380
Let me look it up.

03:00:00.380 --> 03:00:01.380
Cat Baron.

03:00:01.380 --> 03:00:02.380
Can you spell that for me?

03:00:02.380 --> 03:00:03.380
I'm so sorry.

03:00:04.380 --> 03:00:05.380

Okay?

03:00:07.380 --> 03:00:08.380
Sorry.

03:00:08.380 --> 03:00:09.380
I just, I don't understand.

03:00:09.380 --> 03:00:10.380
Oh.

03:00:10.380 --> 03:00:12.380

03:00:20.380 --> 03:00:21.380
Yeah.

03:00:21.380 --> 03:00:22.380
I don't understand.

03:00:22.380 --> 03:00:31.380
And then...

03:00:31.380 --> 03:00:38.300

03:01:54.660 --> 03:02:02.260
Yeah, he was cute. I don't know. I feel like I didn't have any like fictional crushes.

Except for Sonic. Oh, yeah, maybe I'm just very much. Oh, Jeremy Sumpter. Oh, yeah.

03:03:35.060 --> 03:03:47.380
Non human characters that are hot. I'm still trying to think. I don't know. I had too much of a

03:03:47.380 --> 03:03:54.740
grind set. I didn't have time for crushes. Okay, I can think. I remember now. Bumblebee from

03:03:54.740 --> 03:04:00.660
Transformers. Bumblebee from Transformers. And then when he spoke, when he spoke, I was really

03:04:00.660 --> 03:04:15.020
into it. And then I really had a huge crush on Godzilla. I thought Godzilla was so cool. Spirit

03:04:15.020 --> 03:04:23.100
the horse. Yes. Oh, yes. Yeah. Spirit that was Spanish. It was so sexy. I will lie. Yeah,

03:04:23.140 --> 03:04:33.460

03:04:33.460 --> 03:04:47.180
know man. You guys are weird. You didn't think this horse from Spirit is hot. Yeah. I don't

03:04:47.180 --> 03:04:55.580

I like I like incels and my old fat men. Yeah, I got a wide range. Yeah, I like a pretty wide

03:05:25.980 --> 03:05:36.780
range. But if you're like a person, I don't know what my type is. Maybe guys like Sonic. I just

03:05:36.780 --> 03:05:46.260
watched you put spirit. Watch them appear on the screen. You just corrupt the child image. One

03:05:46.260 --> 03:05:53.820
gift was all it took. Spirit is a very charismatic horse. Yeah. And then we were like a horse. I

03:05:53.820 --> 03:05:58.500
felt like I was being flirted with. No, it wasn't the size difference or the power. I think it was

03:05:58.500 --> 03:06:10.780
Godzilla's like swag. I was like, holy shit. All of them. I have a problem. Oh, wait, no. And

03:06:10.780 --> 03:06:17.300

Samurai. I remember which one I just know is Power Rangers Samurai. I fucking I would do it with

03:06:23.140 --> 03:06:28.100
show about Power Rangers. Every time I feel like I'm on screen, I was like, oh, yeah, this is

03:06:28.100 --> 03:06:33.820
hot. I used to have a really big crush on Zuko too. I think everyone does. That's just basic. That's

03:06:33.820 --> 03:06:45.780
basic. Yeah, it's pretty basic. That's my basic one. What about Uncle Irel? Am I right? I agree. No,

03:06:46.260 --> 03:06:56.100
honestly would. No, I'm kidding. This is a safe space. Try. No judgment here. Try. Oh, yeah,

03:06:56.100 --> 03:07:03.780

03:07:03.780 --> 03:07:12.660
Veggie Tales. No. Veggie Tales. I was forced to watch Veggie Tales. I didn't like Veggie

03:07:12.660 --> 03:07:21.860
Tales. I have to watch it. I could watch it to learn English. That's a great show to watch to

03:07:21.860 --> 03:07:22.820
learn English.

03:07:22.820 --> 03:07:26.820

03:07:38.260 --> 03:07:45.460
You guys are just listing off basically every character now. Not all. Not all. Not all.

03:07:46.100 --> 03:07:53.540
Do you guys remember that movie Meet the Robinsons? Yes. Oh, the like black hair. Black hair? Yeah.

03:07:56.500 --> 03:08:03.780
Okay, yeah, that's actually kind of real. I had a crush on Goob, the evil guy. I had a crush on

03:08:03.780 --> 03:08:10.580
the evil guy. Oh, I had a crush on, um, what's his face? The enemy and the Incredibles?

03:08:11.540 --> 03:08:19.700
And what was his name? Central? Yeah. Yeah. I had a crush on Goob, the white hair lady. You

03:08:19.700 --> 03:08:24.500

03:08:24.500 --> 03:08:31.940
pretty. Oh, you are like her. You are like her. Um, Goob when he was older, so like when he was

03:08:31.940 --> 03:08:39.380
like all hunchbacked and like dirty looking and yeah. I like the one slur, but I think that was

03:08:39.380 --> 03:08:44.980
pretty basic. No, no, that's a pretty, that's a pretty. I totally get it though. Like it makes

03:08:44.980 --> 03:08:54.900
sense. Yeah. Mirage. Yeah, he's reminded Mirage. I don't know. I think it's the lowering appeal

03:08:55.620 --> 03:09:00.180
with her. I don't know. I think, I think if I'm like trying to like,

03:09:00.180 --> 03:09:08.980
hmm, it'd be like, oh, I'm, I'm kind of bad, but I'm, I'm like protective.

Like I'm like, I'm strong and I'm powerful. Yeah, maybe bad boy. Maybe like Draco mouth.

03:09:57.060 --> 03:10:01.060
Okay. Cause I, okay. I wasn't in Spanish, right? Okay. I wasn't in Spanish, right? So in Spanish,

03:10:01.060 --> 03:10:07.460
I have seen the Spanish version. I would get so. The voice actor was crazy for Spanish.

03:10:07.460 --> 03:10:14.660
He just sounded so good. So I kind of just like fumbled everything. And I'm also like,

03:10:14.660 --> 03:10:20.340
I'm kind of religious. So religious man, evil religious man. I was like, oh, this is amazing.

03:11:53.460 --> 03:12:07.460
on this cat. This cat? Get that out of my DMs right now. Get that out of my DMs right now.

03:12:07.460 --> 03:12:16.100
Get that out of my DMs right now. I deleted it. You sick one. What did I tell you? I told

03:12:16.100 --> 03:12:21.540
you no. I don't want to see it. What cat? Let's just change the subject. Now what kind of

03:12:21.540 --> 03:12:28.100
you sick bastard? No, she's my friend. She's my friend. She's my friend. She's my friend.

03:12:28.100 --> 03:12:37.620
Why is she your friend? Why is she your friend? Is that the cat from Franklin? No, this is a cat from

03:12:37.620 --> 03:12:45.380
Little Bear. Oh, oh. That's not Little Bear. Chai. Chai. Why is it cat?

03:12:47.300 --> 03:12:52.820
It was more, I think that's a thing. I think it's personality. I think I don't have a physical

03:12:52.820 --> 03:12:58.100
type. I think that's the problem. They could be a cat. They could be a cow. They could be a cucumber.

03:12:58.820 --> 03:13:00.820
Do you know the dog from Lady and the Tramp?

03:13:01.780 --> 03:13:07.460
Uh, yeah. I had a question. The dog, like the lady's love interest, I don't know.

03:13:09.140 --> 03:13:13.460
He went to do everything to be with her, man. I kind of liked it. Wait, what dog? Oh,

03:13:13.460 --> 03:13:18.020
Bolts? The dog from Lady and the Tramp. Oh, I thought, sorry, I thought you meant Bolts.

03:13:19.220 --> 03:13:26.740
Oh, but yes. Uh, Tramp, yeah. I thought he was very attractive. And he loved Lady very much,

03:13:26.980 --> 03:13:33.940
yes. Oh, yeah. Very cute. There's the pure love that I like. Yeah, they were, like,

03:13:33.940 --> 03:13:40.660
different classes. It was very adorable. Now I'm a sucker for the Juliet, Romeo and Juliet type

03:13:40.660 --> 03:13:50.740
of trope. Someone's a sucker for that. I love there so much. Someone said bubble baths from Spongebob.

03:13:51.540 --> 03:13:56.900
No. No, no, no, no. Okay. Who do you like from Spongebob?

03:13:58.660 --> 03:14:04.100
I like the guy in the Spongebob movie that was like the bounty hunter that was hunting them down

03:14:04.100 --> 03:14:08.580
with the really nice boots. Oh, yeah. I forgot about him.

03:14:11.220 --> 03:14:17.540
Dennis, yeah. I didn't have a crush on the Spongebob characters. I was ship in Spongebob.

03:14:17.780 --> 03:14:24.180
We were just ship in them. Maybe the robot lady, the wife. Oh, Karen?

03:14:24.180 --> 03:14:29.940
Karen, yeah. I like the wife. David Hasselhoff. I don't know. David Hasselhoff.

03:14:29.940 --> 03:14:34.020
There hasn't been like, oh, what anime characters do you guys resonate with? Like, what kind of,

03:14:34.020 --> 03:14:38.500
like, oh, this is so- Do I kid? Yeah, like, who do you kid? Who do you guys see? Who do you guys

03:14:38.500 --> 03:14:46.420
kid? Who's your kid? Who's your kid? Who's your kid? I haven't kidned a anime character in a very long

03:14:46.420 --> 03:14:52.500
time. And I usually watch my first kid. I think my, my head always goes to tiger,

03:14:52.500 --> 03:15:01.460
icica, icica, icica, icica, icica. Icicle, yeah. Icicle, tiger. Like, that's like always,

03:15:01.460 --> 03:15:09.700
I can't, it's like uncontrollable, but I think like Toru, Toru Honda.

03:15:10.260 --> 03:15:21.380
I'd have to think about mine. Yeah, I have to think. I couldn't really like kid myself,

03:15:21.380 --> 03:15:25.940
because I have to, I feel like I have to relate to a character, and I don't really feel like I

03:15:25.940 --> 03:15:30.580
really relate it, especially with the anime I watched. I usually used anime as a form of

03:15:30.580 --> 03:15:36.980
escapism. I didn't want anything to remind me of my life. Oh, that, yeah. I usually watch like

03:15:36.980 --> 03:15:42.260
super, I never watched like slice of life stuff. I watched like super high fantasy stuff, or like

03:15:42.260 --> 03:15:49.780
sci-fi, or just like fucking, I was just watching Naruto and Full Metal Alchemist and all the time,

03:15:49.780 --> 03:15:59.940
and I like, yeah, I can't. Oh, I liked Alphonse from Full Metal Alchemist. Is that your kid?

03:15:59.940 --> 03:16:05.940
Suit of armor. No, he's not my kin, but like, I liked him. Oh, you liked him? Oh, okay.

03:16:05.940 --> 03:16:11.540
Suki from Avatar, who I want to be. Oh yeah, I feel that. I don't know. I don't know who I can,

03:16:11.540 --> 03:16:17.140
I'm not gonna say it all out though. I thought you guys would answer too. Is it like a weird? I don't

03:16:17.140 --> 03:16:21.540
know if I have any like weird ones. I think most of them are like pretty, pretty, like sound like

03:16:21.540 --> 03:16:32.900
pretty like normal. Um, I'm gonna keep her to myself. She's your, your anime Oshii. Um, let me see.

03:16:37.780 --> 03:16:43.860
Oh my god. What is it, kin? It's just like a, it's a nerd term to me. I can't do like super

03:16:44.100 --> 03:16:49.220
really, too. You're like, oh, this is me and I am them. They are me. We are one. We are Venom.

03:16:50.180 --> 03:16:58.100
Of course, I'm Venom. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. What's the tongue do? No, no, not the tongue. It wasn't

03:16:58.100 --> 03:17:02.820
the tongue. It was just the fact that he was like a symbiote. Yeah. And I was like, what would he

03:17:02.820 --> 03:17:09.380
feel like if he was inside of me, but not like in a weird way and like, in like a, like in a symbiote

03:17:09.460 --> 03:17:15.620
suit kind of way. Okay. I think, I think I actually might have kin death the kid.

03:17:17.300 --> 03:17:23.620
Yes, yes, yes. Wait, me too, me too, me too. Because I have OCD and so I like really related

03:17:23.620 --> 03:17:29.380
with this character because for obsession with symmetry and stuff. Yeah. Oh, I fucking love

03:17:29.380 --> 03:17:35.460
Solator. Solator was my shit. I had so many OCs. I was very much obsessed with that the kid. I think

03:17:35.460 --> 03:17:39.780
I related to him a lot. Yeah, I want to say that. It's like, I can always, I was like,

03:17:39.780 --> 03:17:44.820
I feel like it's like, I like a character so much I want to be them or like, I'm like, that's so me.

03:17:44.820 --> 03:17:49.860
Yeah. So me for real, for real. That's so me. That's me for real. Let's be for real. Let's be for

03:17:49.860 --> 03:17:58.260
real. I can the dune worm. What the fuck are you doing? What's dune? You don't know what dune is?

03:17:58.980 --> 03:18:04.580
No. It's a book. It's a sci-fi book. I don't know if you, I don't think you would like it at all

03:18:04.580 --> 03:18:11.540
actually or even the movie. I don't only think it's your thing. Nope. Yeah. I like that. Also,

03:18:11.540 --> 03:18:17.540
I don't even know how to read properly. I think I'm like genuinely dyslexic. So that's okay. Oh,

03:18:17.540 --> 03:18:24.580
I know what my, my first, my first kid where I was like, really obsessed with the character and I

03:18:24.580 --> 03:18:29.940
was like, Oh my God, I want that to be me so bad. I wanted it to be me. It was Asuna from Sword Art

03:18:29.940 --> 03:18:37.780
on the line. Oh, I feel it. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mine's with, mine's with Sasuke. Oh, really? Okay.

03:18:37.780 --> 03:18:43.460
Yeah, that's good. Mine's with Sasuke. I'm on the line. What was an anime you wish you were in the

03:18:43.460 --> 03:18:50.180
world in? Like, like, sword art, sword art. Yeah. Mine was, I don't really think it was an anime,

03:18:50.180 --> 03:18:56.500
but I really wish I was in Code Lyoko. Wait, what's that? You don't know what Code Lyoko is? Am I,

03:18:56.740 --> 03:19:03.780
I don't know. So Code Lyoko is this show where these kids go to like school,

03:19:03.780 --> 03:19:08.020
but then there's this like this master computer that like tries to fucking kill them every day.

03:19:08.020 --> 03:19:13.620
Why are there four heads so big? Yeah, they fucking use four heads. But they go into the computer to

03:19:13.620 --> 03:19:20.500
fight, like it's like reset time. And so they just reset time all the time. I just fucking love Code

03:19:20.500 --> 03:19:26.260
Lyoko. That was my shit. Wait, someone says I don't blame TV. I can understand that. I wanted to,

03:19:26.260 --> 03:19:33.380
I, odd, odd was my, oh, I fucking was in love with odd, which was like the cat, the cat boy.

03:19:34.740 --> 03:19:38.980
Oh, wait, I want to look it up now. How do you spell it? It was a really weird

03:19:40.340 --> 03:19:48.580
art style, but yeah, Code Lyoko Ly, okay. Code Lyoko is French. Yes, it's originally French.

03:19:48.580 --> 03:19:55.460
It's so interesting. But I love Bible Villaco. The thing that I wanted to be in, I'm trying to think.

03:19:55.460 --> 03:20:02.100
I wanted to be in Code Lyoko and you know Naruto naturally. Either Yvonne Gellor the persona series,

03:20:02.100 --> 03:20:10.980
yeah, yeah. I know I would die though, but um, oh yeah, I don't know, man.

03:20:10.980 --> 03:20:15.980
Corks party, I'm lying, maybe Corks party, you wanna be a Corks party?

03:20:15.980 --> 03:20:20.980
No, you could not, you would die so fast.

03:20:20.980 --> 03:20:22.980
That's terrible.

03:20:22.980 --> 03:20:23.980
Why?

03:20:23.980 --> 03:20:30.980
Because Kauru isn't Eva, and I was obsessed with him.

03:20:30.980 --> 03:20:39.980
But now, I'm gonna have a Corks party, I'm built different, I'm gonna fucking, I'm gonna walk out of there alive, not a scratch on my body.

03:20:39.980 --> 03:20:46.980
I'm already very mentally disturbed.

03:20:46.980 --> 03:20:50.980
Have you done a playthrough of Corks party on your channel?

03:20:50.980 --> 03:20:52.980
Not on my channel, I've played it before though.

03:20:52.980 --> 03:20:56.980
Oh, okay, cause I'm like, let me know when you do, cause I wanna watch it then.

03:20:56.980 --> 03:21:03.980
Yeah, yeah, if I do I'll let you know, but if I was physically there, that little girl, that little girl was getting punted.

03:21:03.980 --> 03:21:05.980
Oh my god.

03:21:06.980 --> 03:21:10.980
Oh man, that'd be fun, aren't there making a two or something I've seen?

03:21:10.980 --> 03:21:13.980
Yeah, they're redoing it, they're making a new game.

03:21:13.980 --> 03:21:23.980
It's the buttered pooper, I totally forgot, cause I made the buttered pooper references before and I forgot it was from Corks party, such a great fucking game.

03:21:23.980 --> 03:21:26.980
And Madfather, I loved all those RPG maker games.

03:21:26.980 --> 03:21:29.980
What is your favorite visual novel, Nori?

03:21:29.980 --> 03:21:31.980
Sorry.

03:21:31.980 --> 03:21:38.980
Mmm.

03:21:38.980 --> 03:21:39.980
What?

03:21:39.980 --> 03:21:42.980
They said nori, they said Nori.

03:21:42.980 --> 03:21:44.980
Oh, don't look it up, maggot beach.

03:21:44.980 --> 03:21:46.980
What?

03:21:46.980 --> 03:21:49.980
Don't look it up, don't do it, there's no better chair.

03:21:49.980 --> 03:21:51.980
I think I've heard of that.

03:21:51.980 --> 03:21:54.980
How do I spell it? Or send it?

03:21:54.980 --> 03:21:56.980
I don't care.

03:21:56.980 --> 03:21:57.980
I want to

03:21:57.980 --> 03:22:02.980
You might not like it, but I won't like it

03:22:02.980 --> 03:22:05.980
A clapjack just said, oh, mega beat

03:22:05.980 --> 03:22:07.980
I've heard of that, what is that?

03:22:07.980 --> 03:22:11.980
But if you want like a normie, a normie taste

03:22:11.980 --> 03:22:13.980
Um, Totono?

03:22:13.980 --> 03:22:15.980
Is it my one of my favorite ones?

03:22:15.980 --> 03:22:17.980
I think it's very beautifully done

03:22:17.980 --> 03:22:19.980
So I really like this one

03:22:20.980 --> 03:22:22.980
Oh, I'm Sayushi! I'm Sayushi!

03:22:22.980 --> 03:22:24.980
Sayushi's also really good

03:22:24.980 --> 03:22:26.980
I'm going to mess up now

03:22:26.980 --> 03:22:28.980
Wait, hold on, raid, raid, moment, raid, moment

03:22:28.980 --> 03:22:29.980
Another one?

03:22:29.980 --> 03:22:30.980
I'll try

03:22:30.980 --> 03:22:32.980
Another one, oh my god, another one

03:22:32.980 --> 03:22:33.980
Give me a second

03:22:33.980 --> 03:22:35.980
She's popular, she's cool

03:22:36.980 --> 03:22:38.980
I put maggot balls on accident

03:22:38.980 --> 03:22:40.980
It's maggot beads

03:22:40.980 --> 03:22:42.980
So it's maggot beads, Totono

03:22:42.980 --> 03:22:43.980
Oh

03:22:43.980 --> 03:22:46.980
And Sayushi is really good too

03:22:47.980 --> 03:22:50.980
The girl's eye is being popped out of its socket

03:22:50.980 --> 03:22:51.980
Yep

03:22:51.980 --> 03:22:53.980
There's titties in this screen

03:22:53.980 --> 03:22:54.980
Yep

03:22:54.980 --> 03:22:55.980
Yep

03:22:55.980 --> 03:22:57.980
What is this, it's like

03:22:59.980 --> 03:23:01.980
Oh, why? I like it so much

03:23:01.980 --> 03:23:03.980
I think it's just maybe like the art

03:23:03.980 --> 03:23:06.980
And stuff is like really like

03:23:06.980 --> 03:23:08.980
Interesting

03:23:09.980 --> 03:23:11.980
I don't know, I'm like, I'm a huge sucker for like

03:23:11.980 --> 03:23:13.980
Very unique art styles, yeah

03:23:13.980 --> 03:23:15.980
Yeah, I'm not averse to like gore

03:23:15.980 --> 03:23:17.980
And just like dark themes

03:23:17.980 --> 03:23:19.980
So I'm actually like, I'm not

03:23:19.980 --> 03:23:22.980
I'm not really a visual novel person

03:23:23.980 --> 03:23:24.980
Really

03:23:24.980 --> 03:23:26.980
You could just watch a play through of it

03:23:26.980 --> 03:23:29.980
Yeah, maybe I might do that

03:23:29.980 --> 03:23:32.980
I usually will just read manga

03:23:32.980 --> 03:23:35.980
But I haven't even read manga in a long time

03:23:35.980 --> 03:23:39.980
Yeah, consuming Japanese media

03:23:39.980 --> 03:23:41.980
Has mostly been for me, just like anime

03:23:41.980 --> 03:23:44.980
But I usually watch normie animes, so

03:23:44.980 --> 03:23:47.980
I would recommend visual novels if you want like a little base tea

03:23:47.980 --> 03:23:48.980
Some of them are pretty simple

03:23:48.980 --> 03:23:50.980
You're just literally just reading and like

03:23:50.980 --> 03:23:51.980
Picking an option

03:23:51.980 --> 03:23:52.980
Yeah, it's like just

03:23:52.980 --> 03:23:54.980
And you can also Google options

03:23:54.980 --> 03:23:56.980
If you just want to like, if you just want to like

03:23:56.980 --> 03:23:58.980
Have a specific ending done

03:23:58.980 --> 03:23:59.980
Things like that

03:24:00.980 --> 03:24:01.980
I think too hard

03:24:01.980 --> 03:24:03.980
What is it?

03:24:03.980 --> 03:24:05.980
Anyone here watched Food Wars?

03:24:05.980 --> 03:24:07.980
Why did you say it like that?

03:24:08.980 --> 03:24:09.980
Never heard of it

03:24:09.980 --> 03:24:11.980
I don't know what you're talking about

03:24:11.980 --> 03:24:12.980
What's Food Wars?

03:24:12.980 --> 03:24:14.980
Yeah, never, yeah, exactly

03:24:14.980 --> 03:24:16.980
Yeah, I actually don't know what that is

03:24:16.980 --> 03:24:17.980
I'm so hurry

03:24:17.980 --> 03:24:18.980
Hi son

03:24:18.980 --> 03:24:20.980
I just told you I like the maggot baits

03:24:20.980 --> 03:24:22.980
Why the fuck would I look at something that's called

03:24:22.980 --> 03:24:24.980
Food Wars?

03:24:24.980 --> 03:24:27.980
Do you think I'm a normal person now buddy?

03:24:27.980 --> 03:24:29.980
I'm like an edged lord

03:24:29.980 --> 03:24:32.980
Call me Sasuke Uchiha

03:24:32.980 --> 03:24:34.980
Noriko Uchiha

03:24:34.980 --> 03:24:36.980
Noriko Uchiha

03:24:36.980 --> 03:24:38.980
Honestly, kind of a badass name

03:24:38.980 --> 03:24:39.980
Yeah, it's my new name now

03:24:39.980 --> 03:24:41.980
I know man, can you re-brand to that?

03:24:41.980 --> 03:24:43.980
Visual novels often have late scenes though

03:24:43.980 --> 03:24:45.980
Yeah, but if you get them through Steam

03:24:45.980 --> 03:24:47.980
You're like centered so hard

03:24:47.980 --> 03:24:49.980
So it doesn't even matter

03:24:49.980 --> 03:24:50.980
I've heard that

03:24:50.980 --> 03:24:52.980
Yeah, the stuff is centered

03:24:52.980 --> 03:24:54.980
Yeah, but visual novels

03:24:54.980 --> 03:24:57.980
I think are very worth to even just look at

03:24:57.980 --> 03:25:00.980
So if you ever want a visual novel recommendation

03:25:00.980 --> 03:25:02.980
I will

03:25:02.980 --> 03:25:04.980
I can look and I'll send you some

03:25:05.980 --> 03:25:06.980
Thank you

03:25:08.980 --> 03:25:11.980
Alright, it is almost 1.30 a.m. for me

03:25:11.980 --> 03:25:13.980
Call me Puppies, yeah it is

03:25:13.980 --> 03:25:15.980
Yeah, I'm Epi

03:25:15.980 --> 03:25:17.980
I'm also really a fucking piss

03:25:17.980 --> 03:25:19.980
I'm waiting for Chyna to come back

03:25:19.980 --> 03:25:20.980
Oh, she's here

03:25:20.980 --> 03:25:21.980
Hi, I'm here, I'm sorry

03:25:21.980 --> 03:25:23.980
I heard you say you're Epi and have to pee

03:25:23.980 --> 03:25:25.980
Yeah, I need to run

03:25:26.980 --> 03:25:28.980
I was hoping you didn't catch that

03:25:28.980 --> 03:25:29.980
Hello

03:25:29.980 --> 03:25:30.980
Hi

03:25:30.980 --> 03:25:32.980
Welcome Raiders

03:25:32.980 --> 03:25:33.980
Wait, Chyna

03:25:33.980 --> 03:25:34.980
Yes, Raiders

03:25:34.980 --> 03:25:35.980
More Raiders?

03:25:35.980 --> 03:25:37.980
Oh no, it's the same

03:25:37.980 --> 03:25:39.980
Yeah, I was saying hi to her Raiders

03:25:39.980 --> 03:25:43.980
Wait Chy, are all the people you put on the stream right now

03:25:43.980 --> 03:25:45.980
People you found attractive?

03:25:45.980 --> 03:25:47.980
No, no, no

03:25:47.980 --> 03:25:52.980
Okay, so the top left is apparently I sound like her

03:25:52.980 --> 03:25:53.980
Yeah, yeah, yeah

03:25:53.980 --> 03:25:56.980
Freeran Shrek, that's just like a visual image

03:25:56.980 --> 03:25:57.980
For everyone to know

03:25:57.980 --> 03:25:59.980
And then that's your crush

03:25:59.980 --> 03:26:01.980
Right there beside them

03:26:01.980 --> 03:26:03.980
And then this is Shibi's crush

03:26:03.980 --> 03:26:06.980
And then it's my crush in front of chat

03:26:06.980 --> 03:26:07.980
Okay, okay, okay

03:26:07.980 --> 03:26:09.980
I'm so curious

03:26:09.980 --> 03:26:12.980
I learned so much about Noriko today

03:26:12.980 --> 03:26:13.980
Yeah

03:26:13.980 --> 03:26:14.980
I'm a pretty open bloke

03:26:14.980 --> 03:26:16.980
We learned so much about each other

03:26:18.980 --> 03:26:21.980
I think we all have very similar but different tastes in movies

03:26:21.980 --> 03:26:22.980
Yes

03:26:22.980 --> 03:26:25.980
And same opinions, but I enjoy that a lot

03:26:25.980 --> 03:26:27.980
Coral is a damn good villain

03:26:28.980 --> 03:26:30.980
Coral is a very good villain

03:26:30.980 --> 03:26:34.980
If you watch the movie, I recommend watching it in Spanish

03:26:34.980 --> 03:26:36.980
It just sounds a lot better

03:26:36.980 --> 03:26:40.980
There's some videos that are just better in Spanish than in English

03:26:42.980 --> 03:26:45.980
Yeah, I think all of them don't chat

03:26:45.980 --> 03:26:48.980
I'm trying to figure out who to read

03:26:48.980 --> 03:26:49.980
Oh my god, we're gonna read

03:26:49.980 --> 03:26:50.980
Read me, read me

03:26:50.980 --> 03:26:51.980
I can't read

03:26:51.980 --> 03:26:52.980
I got

03:26:52.980 --> 03:26:53.980
Are you on YouTube?

03:26:54.980 --> 03:26:55.980
No

03:26:56.980 --> 03:26:58.980
You can't do that

03:26:58.980 --> 03:27:00.980
I'm like, are you dual streaming?

03:27:00.980 --> 03:27:01.980
Cause then I would

03:27:01.980 --> 03:27:05.980
One day, one day, one day, one day, one day, one day, one day

03:27:06.980 --> 03:27:07.980
One day

03:27:07.980 --> 03:27:09.980
One day, one day

03:27:09.980 --> 03:27:10.980
Alright

03:27:10.980 --> 03:27:12.980
I'll read this person

03:27:12.980 --> 03:27:13.980
Okay

03:27:13.980 --> 03:27:14.980
Who are you gonna read?

03:27:14.980 --> 03:27:16.980
I'll just read whoever you read on Twitch

03:27:16.980 --> 03:27:18.980
If you're ending

03:27:18.980 --> 03:27:19.980
I'm not even ending

03:27:19.980 --> 03:27:20.980
I'm not even ending

03:27:20.980 --> 03:27:21.980
Just read her

03:27:21.980 --> 03:27:22.980
Okay, guys

03:27:22.980 --> 03:27:26.980
I'm sending my pop horse to you

03:27:26.980 --> 03:27:27.980
Alright, bye guys

03:27:27.980 --> 03:27:28.980
Thank you for having me

03:27:28.980 --> 03:27:30.980
Guys, you've been reading so much

03:27:30.980 --> 03:27:32.980
I had so much fun

03:27:32.980 --> 03:27:34.980
Love you

03:27:41.980 --> 03:27:43.980
BGM is loud as hell

03:27:43.980 --> 03:27:44.980
Hi

03:27:44.980 --> 03:27:46.980
Hello, it's me

03:27:47.980 --> 03:27:48.980
It was lovely

03:27:48.980 --> 03:27:50.980
What did you think of the girlies?

03:27:50.980 --> 03:27:51.980
Aren't they amazing?

03:27:52.980 --> 03:27:54.980
I know how to pick them

03:27:55.980 --> 03:27:58.980
But I hope you guys have a wonderful night

03:27:58.980 --> 03:28:00.980
Thank you for coming to stream

03:28:00.980 --> 03:28:03.980
I thought it was a really fun collab

03:28:03.980 --> 03:28:05.980
I just blinked in like one eye

03:28:05.980 --> 03:28:07.980
Blinked slower than the other

03:28:07.980 --> 03:28:09.980
That was really weird

03:28:10.980 --> 03:28:11.980
But yeah

03:28:11.980 --> 03:28:16.980
I'll probably collab with those girls again

03:28:16.980 --> 03:28:18.980
Nory is freaking hilarious

03:28:18.980 --> 03:28:20.980
If you like little base bug girls

03:28:20.980 --> 03:28:21.980
Go see her

03:28:21.980 --> 03:28:23.980
And then Chai is sweet

03:28:23.980 --> 03:28:25.980
And also super fucking funny

03:28:25.980 --> 03:28:27.980
So if you like little cutesy

03:28:27.980 --> 03:28:29.980
Cute and funny double girls

03:28:29.980 --> 03:28:30.980
Go see her

03:28:30.980 --> 03:28:31.980
So please check them out

03:28:31.980 --> 03:28:33.980
Their channels and their Twitter

03:28:33.980 --> 03:28:35.980
Are in my description

03:28:36.980 --> 03:28:39.980
Just like a bigger booger

03:28:39.980 --> 03:28:41.980
She really knows how to pick them

03:28:41.980 --> 03:28:42.980
Exactly

03:28:42.980 --> 03:28:45.980
I hope you guys have a wonderful night

03:28:45.980 --> 03:28:47.980
Bye

03:28:47.980 --> 03:28:49.980
Scum of the earth

03:28:54.980 --> 03:28:56.980
I'll also say for the raid

03:28:57.980 --> 03:28:59.980
Gonna raid some B&U girls

03:29:05.980 --> 03:29:07.980
Thanks for watching
