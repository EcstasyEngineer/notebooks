1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Can you guys see me?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm gonna refresh my own stream.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Staring contest stream.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Did it stream to the wrong thing? Cause I will cry.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I will. I'll cry right on my Twitter space. I'll cry all over everyone.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm gonna... I'm gonna cry.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Where is it?

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's not even showing that I'm live.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It's not even showing that I'm live. Please.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Oh my god, I just got jumped scared by a freaking ad.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Can you guys hear me?

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm just a face in the void.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
This looks so freaking cursed.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I just...

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I don't understand.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Oh my god.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Okay, let me hook up my phone.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Let's just...

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Please.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I beg of you.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's showing that I have... I'm wearing white.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's literally just a black void.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And I'm just staring.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Did the Twitter space die?

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Did it die?

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Oh my god, did the Twitter space just die?

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Hello?

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Are you guys still here?

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Can I do both at the same time?

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Okay, I'm gonna go bye.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Bye, Twitter space.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Bye, Twitter space.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Unless you want two of me at the same time.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
That sounds weird.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Okay, bye.

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Stay classy, my friends.

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I...

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I have a lot to atone for.

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
What?

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
One pauses.

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I have to switch screens, so if I do this, then I'm like, hi.

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm a floating head.

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Hi there.

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Hi.

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Welcome to the void.

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And then...

48
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Okay, I got a burp.

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Okay, bye.

50
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Bye.

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Oh my god.

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
This is working.

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Okay.

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Can you hear me?

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Let's try to boot up.

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Do maternal.

57
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I can't fucking plug in my phone.

58
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Can you hear me fine?

59
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Okay.

60
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I feel like...

61
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
What is floating next to my head?

62
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
What is that?

63
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's like a white dot.

64
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What is that?

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Who are you?

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Wait, it's the blanket.

67
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
How did that happen?

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I was wondering where the blanket went.

69
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Because I'm like, where did the blanket go?

70
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's right there.

71
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And then there's the back of the blanket.

72
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And then there...

73
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I don't know what that is.

74
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
What's that blue thing?

75
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I...

76
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Oh, it's my controller.

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Isn't that controller?

78
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's right there.

79
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's this blue dot.

80
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You can barely see.

81
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Oh my god.

82
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Guys, I can't handle this.

83
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I can see how amazing my rigging is,

84
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
even with just the head.

85
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Wow.

86
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I look like I'm part of a YouTuber showcase

87
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
where I'm just showing all my angles.

88
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Okay.

89
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It might as well put the blanket on.

90
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Hold on.

91
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I can't see what you guys are saying.

92
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Let me just make the screen smaller.

93
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yippee.

94
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
That's the world's smallest blanket.

95
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So, head.

96
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Shiba, you are a beautiful mess.

97
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I...

98
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I don't know what to do.

99
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I don't know what to do.

100
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Okay.

101
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I don't know what to do.

102
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I try my best out here.

103
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And at least the stream is still working.

104
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You know?

105
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Like, honestly, I'm pretty impressed.

106
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Let's put on some clothes, shall we?

107
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Let me just...

108
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yippee.

109
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Yahoo.

110
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Oh, yeah.

111
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
My neck looks so orange.

112
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Hey.

113
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Wait, no, now I'm all over the place.

114
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
This isn't gonna work, guys.

115
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I don't know what to do.

116
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
My neck is really orange.

117
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It doesn't matter if you're late.

118
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's literally just been scuffed, brother.

119
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
B2 shooting is better glue.

120
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I agree with this because, like, I don't know what it's exactly attaching to,

121
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
but I don't know.

122
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You'd think that, like...

123
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I don't know.

124
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I don't know how.

125
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
If I stay like this, I look fine.

126
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Now you can take as many screenshots as you want,

127
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
because I'm so cute.

128
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Mmm.

129
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I can't wink with my other eye that well.

130
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
What the shivity?

131
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Ah, see?

132
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I forgot that my mouth can move all the way over there.

133
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Ah.

134
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Ah?

135
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Ah.

136
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Ah.

137
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Ah.

138
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Hot and cute.

139
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Refling, oh, hi.

140
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Hi, reflings.

141
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Like, 300 people just got dumped in my chat,

142
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
and I'm just a loser.

143
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Can't read it, can't read it, can't read it.

144
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Nothing's working.

145
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
So I'm just sitting here.

146
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Hold on, let me try to open up.

147
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
DOOM.

148
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Nope, that's not Steam, that's Discord.

149
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
What happened?

150
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm literally gonna cry, guys.

151
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Oh my...

152
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Hold on, I need to put on my crying emoji for this.

153
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So...

154
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I look like I'm about to do an apology video.

155
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I look like I'm about to do an apology video,

156
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
and also my chat isn't working on screen.

157
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm really identifying with the reflings right now,

158
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I think I'm in a puke.

159
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So, you know how...

160
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
my internet has been going in and out for the past few days?

161
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Should I get a ukulele?

162
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Do I have any instruments?

163
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Do I have any, I will...

164
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I don't think I have any instruments.

165
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Oh, I do.

166
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I don't even remember why I have these maracas, but I have maracas?

167
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I don't know why.

168
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I don't know why I have a maracas PNG.

169
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I don't know why.

170
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So you guys know how my internet has been going in and out.

171
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
For...

172
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
the last few days, and stream has been weird, and so have my calls.

173
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Do me turn, I'll never finish downloading!

174
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And only downloaded 34 gigs!

175
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I never finished!

176
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And I open up Steam and it doesn't say, oh, any downloads are queued!

177
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It's over, bros! I'm so sorry I let you down!

178
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's literally 34 out of 78 gigs downloaded,

179
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
because I was literally about to go click play,

180
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
and I, you know, I played Elden Ring today,

181
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
and it doesn't say anything downloads are queued,

182
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
or nothing's paused, or whatever.

183
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It's chip over!

184
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I need a maracas noise.

185
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It's chip over!

186
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
This is not maracas, it's me shaking food.

187
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Chick, chicky, boom, chick, chicky, boom, chick, chicky, boom.

188
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000

00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
What other weird PNG, well you guys know I have, like, a gun.

190
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Wait.

191
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Oh, I think I remember.

192
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Wait, what's this?

193
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Oh, yeah, that's hehehehe.

194
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Hold on, wait, did I ever change the color of the skin tone on this?

195
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Guys! I'm, I'm so sorry.

196
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I forgot that it does that!

197
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I just wanted to look like I was moving or sitting down!

198
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Now they're really gonna think I'm a whore!

199
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm sorry.

200
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
No, that's too many!

201
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
How does it, oh and I move my mouse upwards.

202
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I thought, wait.

203
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
What?

204
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
What?

205
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Wait a second.

206
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Wait, what?

207
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm sorry.

208
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

209
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
What?

210
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Wait a second.

211
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:10,000
No, I'm not one of those streamers, where did my pants go?

212
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,660
My eyes are burning.

213
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,660
I just hurt my nose.

214
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:19,660
I just scratched my nose with my nail.

215
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:29,660
I'm falling apart.

216
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:34,660
And you're laughing at me.

217
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:42,660
And you're laughing.

218
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:52,660
Can I stop crying?

219
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:58,660
Okay, now I can sweat.

220
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:02,660
Hello, Raifling.

221
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:05,660
Somebody take this away.

222
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,660
Somebody take it away from me.

223
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:12,660

225
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:22,660
You know what?

226
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:26,660
I think I'm gonna do it.

227
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,660
I'm gonna end it all.

228
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:32,660
Hold on.

229
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:36,660
Hold on.

230
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:43,660
Pretend that this is a building.

231
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,660
Okay, you guys stay with me.

232
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,660

00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,660
Stay with me here.

235
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,660
No.

236
00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:03,660
Okay, pretend this is a building and not a casting couch.

237
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:12,660
And that this is lava?

238
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,660
All right.

239
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:19,660
It's boiling lava.

240
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,660
Okay.

241
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:31,660
And then, naturally, I'm a G, so I gotta wear these.

242
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:34,660
Sure.

243
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:38,660

I'm gonna do it.

248
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,660
I'm gonna do it right now.

249
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,660
Tell me.

250
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:57,660
Tell me I won't.

251
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,660
Tell me I won't.

252
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,660
What is on my... what is that?

253
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,660
Oh, wait, no, that's on my screen.

254
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:09,660
I thought there was something on my face.

255
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,660
Goodbye.

256
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,660
Wait, I just made myself smaller.

257
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,660
Wait, hold on.

258
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,660
Wait, no.

259
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,660
Flip.

260
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,660
Ah!

261
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:37,660
In the arms of an angel

262
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:44,660
In the arms of an angel

263
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:52,660
An angel

264
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,660
Wait!

265
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,660
That's so hard to do!

266
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,660
Where am I?

267
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,660
No, that's so hard to do!

00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,660
Wow, wow, wow.

274
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:45,660
Wait, can I make a tiny body for myself?

275
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,660
Wait, no, I have a better idea.

276
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,660
Sorry, I still have the reverb on.

277
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,660
Okay, don't worry, guys.

278
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:56,660

279
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,660
Wait, no, that won't work.

280
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:05,660

Okay.

282
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,660

What's wrong with you?

289
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,660

But the brain worms are winning because I'm one of them now and this is all that's left of me

When I

And my whole entire computer is frozen. I don't even know if I'm streaming anymore

472

Alright, what do you think?

1127
01:58:28,160 --> 01:58:29,160
Do you like my new body?

1128
01:58:29,160 --> 01:58:32,160
It's not as good as the noodle.

1129
01:58:32,160 --> 01:58:34,160
But it's pretty decent.

1130
01:58:34,160 --> 01:58:42,160
I would have been better if I put the bread over the whisk.

1131
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:44,160
I'm a bread nugget.

1132
01:58:44,160 --> 01:58:47,160

01:58:52,160 --> 01:58:59,160
Then it kind of, or like go cross-eyed, then it kind of works.

1135
01:58:59,160 --> 01:59:02,160

01:59:02,160 --> 01:59:03,160

Secret or Dacted

1253
02:08:29,480 --> 02:08:34,320
Yep, it's iron mouse. You heard it here. No, I'm kidding. We're not clubbing iron mouse. That'd be funny

1254
02:08:35,040 --> 02:08:37,040

1255
02:08:37,160 --> 02:08:39,160

02:08:59,760 --> 02:09:04,160

Mean I put that there. I can't see the chat

1262
02:09:24,840 --> 02:09:27,800
No, why does it sound like I'm doing a machine on Tuesday

1263
02:09:31,280 --> 02:09:33,280
Wednesday the 28th what

1264
02:09:34,280 --> 02:09:36,520
I think you guys are telling me what day it was I

1265
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:43,320
Just realized the second VTubers burps I've rated if I had a nickel for every this happened at two nickels

1266
02:09:43,320 --> 02:09:49,240
Which is much but weird it happened to it. It's not weird. Just watch any veeler member and we all just burp a lot

1267
02:09:52,640 --> 02:09:55,840
The game down. No, it's not gonna download because

1268
02:10:04,600 --> 02:10:11,400
Sorry, I'm threatening I'm threatening Mario indians. Um, because if I'm streaming it's not gonna be able to download at the same time

1269
02:10:14,200 --> 02:10:16,840
No, I get the reference I know the reference

1270
02:10:17,720 --> 02:10:19,480
I'm just

1271
02:10:19,480 --> 02:10:26,560
Denying the reference. I'm just I'm ignoring it and I'm saying you should have six nickels

1272
02:10:27,600 --> 02:10:30,780
I'll give you a nickel if you tickle my pickle

1273
02:10:34,160 --> 02:10:36,160
I

1274
02:10:43,640 --> 02:10:46,240
Anyways, um, so what should we do Tuesday boys?

1275
02:10:49,840 --> 02:10:54,980
Should we actually do doom do maternal on Tuesday on cheese that unit

1276
02:10:57,440 --> 02:11:04,140
Hi madam occasionally may need to clear the download cache for steam it improves download speed and fixes a lot of problems

1277
02:11:04,160 --> 02:11:09,760
People get with downloads. It may make you restart the download, but this normally helps. Thank you

1278
02:11:09,760 --> 02:11:16,720
I appreciate that information. However, it is not relevant because when I stream my internet goes crazy

1279
02:11:16,720 --> 02:11:20,600
And I get really terrible upload speeds while I'm trying to download something

1280
02:11:20,600 --> 02:11:25,600
So that's why I'm not actively trying to download do me eternal for an hour and 40 minutes

1281
02:11:26,280 --> 02:11:28,280
Because that's the remainder

1282
02:11:29,480 --> 02:11:31,480
While I'm streaming

1283
02:11:34,160 --> 02:11:36,160
Yes

1284
02:11:36,400 --> 02:11:41,920
Any whore, thank you for the stupa. I hope you like my jiggly pudding titties

1285
02:11:43,840 --> 02:11:45,840

02:27:08,140 --> 02:27:10,140

02:27:18,140 --> 02:27:20,140

02:27:24,780 --> 02:27:28,860
Something shooting at me that guy shooting at me

It's nice to freak it a bit to get the dynamite thing than than don't

1435
02:29:02,620 --> 02:29:04,620
There is a platypus he's rabid

Ouch

1440
02:29:34,140 --> 02:29:38,700
I was about to say we're gonna play it safe, but then I got a fucking shot hit by the dude so

1441
02:29:48,780 --> 02:29:54,060
I have amazing range. Oh, what the frick, where did you come from brother?

1442
02:30:00,940 --> 02:30:04,060

1443
02:30:04,460 --> 02:30:06,460
Oh

1444
02:30:17,500 --> 02:30:19,500
Usually he falls down

1445
02:30:25,660 --> 02:30:27,660
Hmm

1446
02:30:28,060 --> 02:30:30,060

1450
02:31:07,820 --> 02:31:09,820

1451
02:31:16,940 --> 02:31:18,940

1454
02:31:46,460 --> 02:31:49,180
Wait before I go over there because I keep dying over there

1455
02:31:58,380 --> 02:32:00,380
Oh

1456
02:32:20,220 --> 02:32:22,220

I found you bitch

1458
02:32:27,820 --> 02:32:30,460
What I thought there's a visible dude

1459
02:32:35,340 --> 02:32:37,340
What is that the noise

1460
02:32:39,260 --> 02:32:41,260
Is something trying to shoot me

1461
02:32:44,300 --> 02:32:46,300
Wait something open

1462
02:32:49,740 --> 02:32:52,540
I hear something opening. Oh what the hell

1463
02:32:52,940 --> 02:32:54,940
Oh

1464
02:32:56,460 --> 02:32:58,460
You got the shotgun

1465
02:33:01,660 --> 02:33:03,660
What's opening

1466
02:33:04,860 --> 02:33:06,860
I'll never know

1467
02:33:13,980 --> 02:33:17,100
And it wasn't it just up here yeah, it was

1468
02:33:17,900 --> 02:33:21,500
Yeah, it was number keys. Jump down

1469
02:33:23,980 --> 02:33:25,980
Please

1470
02:33:28,540 --> 02:33:31,660
Now I gotta go and retrace my steps

1471
02:33:31,660 --> 02:33:33,660
Trace my steps

1472
02:33:46,140 --> 02:33:48,140
Ah

1473
02:33:49,020 --> 02:33:51,020
Oh, I should have done that

1474
02:33:52,700 --> 02:33:57,500
To close proximity boys something itchy in my eye

1475
02:34:02,540 --> 02:34:04,540
Ah

1476
02:34:10,060 --> 02:34:12,060
I got him

1477
02:34:15,420 --> 02:34:17,420
What the fuck is that noise

1478
02:34:21,580 --> 02:34:24,540
I need a blue key. Where's the red door?

1479
02:34:25,500 --> 02:34:30,300
This is becoming too elaborate

1480
02:34:33,500 --> 02:34:40,300
I wish I would tell me when I used a key because I can't tell if I've been someplace already unless there's enemies there

1481
02:34:44,940 --> 02:34:50,620
I bet someone was able to get doom on tamagotchi. You could easily play doom on tamagotchi

1482
02:34:55,500 --> 02:35:02,460
This is where I fucking came from but fuck it. Let's retrace our steps

1483
02:35:15,420 --> 02:35:19,820
How the hell I'm getting motion sick

1484
02:35:24,540 --> 02:35:26,540
A blue key

1485
02:35:30,700 --> 02:35:32,700
I guess I don't need that

1486
02:35:33,980 --> 02:35:38,620
Yeah, I love doom eternal. It's great. This is the best doom game

1487
02:35:40,220 --> 02:35:42,220
That's better than the original

1488
02:35:42,700 --> 02:35:46,220
Could I put my silly eyes on? What are my silly eyes? Oh

1489
02:35:47,980 --> 02:35:51,020
I can't put my silly eyes on because

1490
02:35:52,220 --> 02:35:54,140
um

1491
02:35:54,140 --> 02:35:57,820
It's attached to my body. I don't have a I don't have

1492
02:36:03,020 --> 02:36:05,340
Oh, oh my god

1493
02:36:10,300 --> 02:36:12,300
Oh, I can

1494
02:36:12,300 --> 02:36:14,300
I

1495
02:36:29,660 --> 02:36:31,660
Be not afraid

1496
02:36:32,860 --> 02:36:34,860
Be not afraid

1497
02:36:34,860 --> 02:36:40,460
All right, all these eyes are staying on for the rest of stream

1498
02:36:42,220 --> 02:36:47,980
How long have I been streaming for?

1499
02:36:52,060 --> 02:36:54,060
Oh

1500
02:36:54,940 --> 02:36:57,980
How long have I been streaming for?

1501
02:37:09,100 --> 02:37:13,340
About two hours. All right, we'll continue

1502
02:37:14,060 --> 02:37:16,060
Okay

1503
02:37:22,940 --> 02:37:24,940
I've already been here

1504
02:37:29,580 --> 02:37:35,580
Hugging the walls for any secrets, okay, where do I need to go I need to go this way

1505
02:37:43,580 --> 02:37:45,580
I

1506
02:37:53,820 --> 02:37:55,820
Ain't a blue key for that

1507
02:38:13,340 --> 02:38:15,340
I

1508
02:38:21,500 --> 02:38:25,180
Really just looking for doors it's over here

1509
02:38:28,940 --> 02:38:31,580
Well, no

1510
02:38:38,540 --> 02:38:40,540
It's a wall

1511
02:38:43,580 --> 02:38:45,580
Man, it's over here

1512
02:38:57,500 --> 02:39:04,060
The heck it's showing like there's something it like it's a path. Oh, I just cleaned the districts itself

1513
02:39:04,940 --> 02:39:11,020
I picked up an armor bonus didn't even mean to

1514
02:39:15,420 --> 02:39:18,940
Picked up a stimpact didn't even mean to where am I?

1515
02:39:21,820 --> 02:39:23,820
I'm back at the start

1516
02:39:34,860 --> 02:39:37,660
I'm trying to navigate with just the

1517
02:39:45,100 --> 02:39:47,100
Okay, I found the room

1518
02:39:49,420 --> 02:39:52,780
Guys, I found it. I found the room

1519
02:39:52,780 --> 02:40:05,580
Really if I just hug like if I just go through the map like that I can find the things I don't

1520
02:40:06,860 --> 02:40:08,860
Get that at all, but it works for me

1521
02:40:13,180 --> 02:40:17,340
Uh now if I could remember where the blue room was

1522
02:40:17,580 --> 02:40:23,580
Okay, well we're gonna do it again

1523
02:40:28,700 --> 02:40:30,700
Anyways

02:40:31,660 --> 02:40:33,660
It's hard to control

1525
02:40:35,500 --> 02:40:37,500
Can I please go down the hallway? Thank you

1526
02:40:42,380 --> 02:40:44,380

I quadrupled it

1544
02:43:22,620 --> 02:43:24,620

1568
02:46:32,380 --> 02:46:34,380
