homebound, that probably was not the best grace to go to, what are we working towards again, I'm getting all the sacred tears, not all of them, just like a good chunk, I should probably look for some golden seeds while I'm at it, I should probably do that too, I have so many fucking tags, let me back up, so that one's three, I wish there was a way to just clear all my beacons, is that a thing, is there a toggle to do that, I highly doubt it, get rid of you, no, I just wanted to, thank you, no not those kind of tags, you fucking idiots, all right, where's one, where's this one pointing at, one

to the B-seal sect, where the fuck is that, where's the, I mean, map link, oh I think I already grabbed that, yeah I did, okay, there's one in the cellio town of sorcery under a phantom tree in the northern section of town, okay, let's go talk to invisible people, we love to see you, yeah, can you travel to that ship, no, that'd be cool if you could, I don't know, can you travel to that ship, I don't know, I've never been able to, um, what is happening, what is, what is happening, what's happening, what is happening to my stick, why isn't it moving, the fuck, that was a weird ass glitch, anyways, um, I'm right next to the cellio town of sorcery, it's like right over here, it's like, like up here, here, all right, let's go talk to these bitches, damn it, oh I see it, oh there's a way for me to get down, nice, nice, something behind me, oh comical typing, oh thank god there's a grace right here, I'm so close to death, no, I meant to sit down, Jesus Christ, don't you hate when just like balls just like go to your face, just sucks, um, okay, this is the tree, it was like literally over there, oh are you shitting me right now, what do you have to say about this, oh it's because I went the back way, damn I have to go around, I hear people creepily making noises on the other side, oh it's that, oh, um, I'm fine, yeah I'm fine, nice, uh cool, I totally just, cool, yeah, nice, cool, what a beautiful town, really, look how, how gorgeous it is, it's so empty, can't believe nobody lives in this gorgeous, beautiful town, I kind of want to drop down on this thing, yeah, yeah, uh, oh quick teleport, I don't want to accidentally aggro people when I can't get out, I got a bullet, I'm scared, I'm so sorry, you live there, I'm so sorry that you do, um, okay, cool, we got that, uh, one can be, did I get that one near red main, I mean I think I did, I think, did I, I'm sorry, I wanted to do these ones, um, oh yeah, no I definitely talked to him, um, so I definitely probably grabbed that one, question mark, let me just sit down, I need three golden seeds, uh, I think I already grabbed that one, am I winning, that's debatable, there's also the pewter tree spirit, but I don't feel like doing that, um, okay, let's go to limb grave, because I haven't, I haven't gone to limb grave, I also haven't gone to fort height, yeah, there's fort height, there's the starfall center, uh, fort height is over here, it is, it was really interesting, my first playthrough, um, I had a weird glitch that live never spawned, and I didn't do anything, like it's like I literally was like playing the game as linearly as it can get, and you could hear Blythe like howl and shit or whatever the fuck noise he makes, but then I never saw him, he never, and he's like, you know he's like at the top of that thing or whatever, I had to restart my game so I could talk to him, I didn't, well I just made another game, I just, because I was just like, what the fuck, it was really weird, uh, yeah the whistle never worked, yeah because you have to get the whistle so he shows up, yeah it never worked, he just glitched and never showed, hi, I don't feel like talking to you, um, not that I have any money to buy shit, hey, how's it going, how's it going everyone, I don't mind if I grab that real quick, oh I gotta go, it's been cool, nice seeing you all, it's been a really long time, glad to see you guys are all in good spirits, love that for you, yeah, oh yeah there's just a thingy, um, I still, okay I'm not, uh, where is the other one, yeah I was really annoying, let me find the sleeping peninsula, fuck, did I get that one, I can't recall, I don't think I did, again I've literally just been bouncing around places so I probably haven't gone to places, oh, okay maybe I did, we'll just see, so literally like right here, let's see if I got that one because I can't recall if I did, isn't there like a giant here, yeah, there it is, I don't think I grabbed it because of the giant, um, yeah there it is, I think I was more distracted by the giant, yep, let her go towards, good job, make it down, thank you, that's a close one, yikes, um, so aggro, I can't get out of here, yippee, let me just get rid of that marker, I can't get rid of the marker, let's just float, run at the marker, whoa, we're gonna kill this giant, get him, hurry before he shoots the ground, yeah, ow, yeah, what, I thought I jumped, I'm just not jumping, at least you're not doing that much damage to me, that's cool, um, thanks, I'm sure you can have your bow, that'd be nice, arm, arm, what's up here again, how are we gonna, aw, thank you, your sheepee tax, that's cute, thank you, thank you for the tip, um, when you guys are useless, just start paying me money, that's sad, okay, I got that, wait, why don't I, I just forget to do things, tutorial island, that's a good way of putting it, cool, nice, okay, so we got the riot, um, if I kill Kenneth height, I can get one, I didn't know I could kill Kenneth height for a fucking thing, so, if you kill him, he gives you a golden seed, Kenneth did nothing wrong, you can max it out without killing him, I never knew that, because I completed his quest before, and I know I could kill him, I just would have, learning of the gains, damn, there's one in the carry a manor, I do love carry a manor, it's one of my favorite levels to clear, there's one in oxtella, there's one in sofra, lindel, yeah, two can be found underneath the phantom tree inside the western gate, capillel skirts, he's gonna steal her to stormville castle when you steal her elven line, I think completing this quest along with the water, yeah, nepheli, whatever, you max upgrade, yeah, I did that before, okay, there's really nothing else I could grab without having to defeat bosses, because there's also a tree spirit in the pharynx roll heroes grave, and I do have the key to get into that, and there's also the putrid spirit boss at the end of the war dead catacombs, so that would be two, but that's not really my goal right now, my goal is just because I would rather be leveled so I can just fuck everybody up and then get those later, so now I'm thinking we go get that mimic tear, I think, I think it's time the base talisman, what's the base talisman, I did clear the pharynx roll heroes grave, I just don't remember the name of shit, I just

happening, don't worry about it, the two fingers and three fingers make a hand, why, I don't know, yeah because Ronnie likes the three fingers, they like the two fingers and they together make a hand, because you got like the thumb is supposed to definitely be over here and then you, I feel like this is, yeah the thumb's supposed to be over here, then the ring and the pinky finger and then those are the three fingers, they're so gross, I hate them so much, um Ronnie likes the three fingers, wait I forget, who likes the three fingers, yeah Ronnie doesn't want any, she's like I fucking hate the greater will, I need to watch like another one of those lore videos with the update stuff with the DLC, hey it's you, I used to think this guy was cute, why, I don't know because you can't even see his fucking face, um yeah it's D, I just think of the fucking memes from look up, just look up uh Game Grumps playing Elden Ring and they do the funniest fucking little bit for D and it's hilarious,

sweet, Why do you have chains on your legs? It's like, why are you so ugly? You know, just ask people why they have chains on their legs and why they're ugly. I'm going to kill this guy, because I feel like it. Oh, I got a new member. Welcome. Welcome to the harem. Are there any details to pay attention to the forces of our life at this time? You guys are the real one. Oh, nice. I got one of those. Isn't that like late game? I forget. Ugh, weird. I got that boom boom pow. Oh, we're both going to kill each other? Yeah. Stop. Don't heal again, you motherfucker. I have frostbite. Stop it. No, you don't get to kill me. No. What? I threw my controller across the room. I don't know if you guys hear it, heard it. No, I think it kind of just like rolled over my couch to be honest with you, then plopped on the ground. Looks like we have a new throne entry. No, I need to add, what's it called? Am I throne? I usually get new joy cons because I have six drifts. I'm going to go grab my controller. Thank you. Oh, are you taking care of this one? Okay, a little ruffle of your process. Alright, where'd it go? Oh, over here. Hi, Raina. Are you like, ended up in your general direction? I'm going to get on the stretch. Yeah. You want to stretch me? You want to stretch me? Yeah, all of you. You didn't do the stretching, did you? Oh, you can see it. Hi, Raina. I know you're here. I just saw you, Raina. I thought you were being fake. Here, you're looking a little bit chunky. What's that, Raina? Why do you look so large? Here, why do you look a little funny? It's because we're done. Come here. You look like you're taking over this world. It was raised alongside dogs, but under a rescuer, and sometimes she curls her tail over her back. I mean... Yeah, can you do a big stretch? Yeah, a lot of big stretch. Yeah? Raina, stretch! She did it. She got up on her tippy toes and stretched her up real long. You guys missed it. Sorry. Why do I have in my box of Korean food? Fuck away from here. No, is this a shiho right? I'm fine. What's in here? I got... They're all just like pastry things. Victory pie. Ooh, a victory pie. I should eat a victory pie. I'll eat this victory pie. The vic pie. That's a weird-looking thing on it. After I beat the fucking mad tone, al-bar-la-la-la-la. I'm about to go mono-e-mono. My headphones are off. I need to plug in my controller again. Oh, my God. She said, call that dolphin kitty. My cat used to do that. That's cute. If you're confident, you can get replacement choices whether they be cheap or expensive. You don't know what you're doing. What? Placement joysticks? You want me to take apart my controller? You want me to take apart my Joy-Con? I'm smart, but I'm not that smart. See, it works fine. My PlayStation controller works fine. I'll break. I come to bargain. I'll take this, though. You don't get to stun-lock me, dude. No. What the fuck? What the hell? I want a scythe. Where do I get this fucking scythe? Oh, my God. He's going to kill me again. I got frostbite. Why don't you fucking heal? Yeah. Why don't you fucking heal? Motherfucker. Yeah, you don't have any more, bitch. Oh, shit. Oh, fuck. Oh, shit. But I have more. Because I'm that bitch. Anyways. Is that the meta in the PvP? I never ever play PvP. Is that the meta? Did this be a door? I don't know. You tell me. Stole his tongue. Mmm. Time for this victory pie. It looks really gross. Ew. It smells bad. Is it supposed to be strawberry flavored? It has a giant V on it. For Veeler. It's a calming bad tongue as well. I found madness to break PvP, at least when I'm getting invaded. Oh, nice. Mmm. It doesn't taste good. Oh, thanks. I'm good. Oh, thank you. Damn. You write a whole fucking essay on the four agreements, bro? Jesus Christ. I just had to read it. That's okay. I don't need this. I like Stormville. I mean Stormville. I like Moonville. Sexy. I am sexy. I am sexy. What are you doing? Okay, is there a better snack in here that is actually tasty? Is this coffee? Or coffee flavored? It's like a wafer. I can't get it out. Oh. It is coffee flavored. It's actually not bad. Interesting. Kind of tweaking my mind out, because I feel like I'm drinking coffee, but I'm eating a biscuit. Brother writing a thesis. I usually don't like coffee flavored things. I just prefer to drink coffee. Lever or lever? Why? I haven't had tiramisu in a long time. Espresso mixed into chocolate goes pretty hard. I thought it was a party hard. Too bad the place I bought the front was down. Oh, that's too bad. Look at all these overgrown swords. Pickle? Aren't the flower up there? Read message. I want to roll into the fire. Let's me roll into the fire. What am I doing next? I'm sorry. I immediately turned when I saw it. It was kind of funny. I'm getting the Mogue tier. Where's the Mogue tier? I'm going to go over here and I'm going to grab that. I'm going to go to the Ertree Gazing Hill. What is this? I'm literally just taking a bite of things and then throwing it away. Why is everything like a fig Newton? What is supposed to be in the middle of this? Why is it spicy? Am I allergic? I don't think I like that. I'm covered in crumbs. No, I think I'll be good. Oh, shit. Why did I not see this before? Hello? Why did I not grab that? I think I have enough to level up. No. No, I don't. No. I know there's some in the center. Exactly, Boomi. Oh, am I allergic? No. Hi. Are you headbutting the box? What's up? Did you want it? I was going to headbutt me. You chewed this box, by the way. Oh, my main main. Oh, such a big head. Yeah. What are you chewing on the box? He's a dog. Puppy? You're a little puppy? You're a little puppy dog? Boomi, are you teasing? Baby? I actually still have Boomi's first baby tooth, just like a mom. I regret where I put it, though. Is that it? No. Welcome. Day two of stream watching. Welcome, welcome. So, let me go grab this. Here. That's all the way over there. At least I can see where the fuck I'm going. I can also kill some fire monks so I can be more resistant to fire magic myself. I might do that when I find some of my farm some fire monks. Monks? Monks? Why am I saying monks? What the fuck is wrong with me? I don't have my headphones in, so I can't tell if anything's attacking me or not. I'm not sure if the music's just changed. I should probably put my thumb in. Missed the Furpy App hour because you were asleep? No worries. We still yapping, we still having a good time. I was eating soup. You missed the soup, bro. Let's get rid of Radon's Rune or keep the Godric one. I forget what Radon's Rune does. I didn't even go to the tower for his Rune. So, let me see. Yeah, see, I can't. I haven't gotten it benedicted yet. It's best for a late game. Increases health, fp, and endurance by 10%. I hate that. It isn't just a standard status. You have to pop it, the Rune, to use it. I'll be honest with you, when I beat the game, I never even used great runes. I never factored those into my builds. I'm going the wrong way. Excuse me. I don't mind you guys educating me on great runes. Where is it? It's over here. I was some time. It was very rarely. It was a random thing rolling down the way. Let's get it honestly same bro I already grabbed the one over here oh no I didn't don't mind if I do you wink there's a lot of golden seeds over here alrighty somebody stop me this is gonna be I

Okay. Just check me. Just check me. Hi. Oh, did you hear that? Go show me the work. I don't know. Let's see. I'll call a bit and I can change this. Oh, wait. This isn't for you. Go away. I'll call a bit and I can change this. I'll call a bit and I can change this. Stop. No. Don't be. Why are you trying to take me so much today? Turn around and move easy. You might not be able to see me. Let's put it in the microwave. Don't start jumping in the microwave. Boomi is here. Well, he wants to pull him out of Boomi. First, she be steals Boomi chicken noodles soup. Now, his mac and cheese. Oh, he does. He climbs in the cabinets. He climbs in the fridge. He climbs in my washing machine. He tries to get into the dryer, but it's stacked on top of the washing machine so you can't get to it. He tries to get into the microwave. I think he's talking to the microwave once. He's got a dishwasher where I was loading it up and I walked away for a moment. He literally has, I have to double check that he's not somewhere so I don't accidentally fucking kill him. I'm just going to feed up. I have a little next-level thing that you can feed it up and it has essential oils and stuff. So it's kind of like a relaxive... relaxive. I'm going to put a little bit of barbecue sauce on my mac and cheese and a little barbecue sauce. And you know, thankfully I have barbecue sauce because I only accommodate it to my home. It's Chick-fil-A barbecue sauce. I'm going to put a little balsamic on it, you know, a little bit of balsamic. Oh, delicious. He's talking me into buying groceries. Mmm, girl dinner. It's just what? It's just mac and cheese and a little bit of barbecue sauce on my phone. Very tasty. He's trying to bake it in the bottom. Oh, my God. My diet is condiments? No. It's very sacred to have girl dinner. Very sacred. It's very good girl dinner. You need real food that's not DoorDash? Yeah, so... I'm not sure if it's a Bible study. Girl dinner is essential. Yeah, Toma gets it. Toma has amazing girl dinners, so like she'll post her for girl dinners of the day for girl breakfast. Precisely. I'll be able to get some home cooked meals. It's funny because like I can cook, like I'm a good cook and all I just don't have any rest like materials to cook with. Oopsies. Oh, hey, my audio comes out today. Where do I get Azur's comment? My eye itches. I'll have to do Selen's quest. Is it worth it? Because I feel like, because that doesn't like stomach him. That'll be a while. No? Okay. What are your suggestions? Do you think I should really just like aim just to do bleed? Because I remember last time I beat Mogue, I literally, I just summoned somebody and they literally just whipped out Azur's comment and just fucking mowed him down. And I was like, oh, thanks, Rando. Because again, yeah, he's very slow. Yeah, give me, give me some just because I still have one slot. I have a slot, a memory slot. I'm cracking it back. Ah, there it is. Ah, there it is again. That's if you're overleveled from him. No, I try to like be bosses by myself in the night. If I can't do it, then I'll summon you guys. There's no suit with dead. I just teared and commented him too, but you need to be quite leveled. Okay. Nice crack. I'll look at my butt. I'm kidding. I'm looking at my boobs. I'm kidding. I'm getting a really bad pain in my lower back. I feel like I need to like stand up. I'm going to put my pants down so I can lift this heat on my back. Oh, that feels so good. Ah, my back hurts too. Sorry, again, I'm a 52 year old woman. Sorry, 56 year old woman. So it's very hard to live. I'm getting dialysis on my ass. Sorry. And the breasts are out of strength on the screen. How's that? Good. Torture y'all. Tell me, did you just steal her spring? Are you bringing it to me? Do you want me to throw it? Okay, drop it. Oh, thank you. Ready? We're getting it. Brother, did you get it? Okay, bring it back. Bring it back. Nope, bring it back. Boomie. You dropped it too far. Don't look at me. I'm not grabbing it. He's like looking at me like, why don't you come and pick it up and throw it again, please? Yeah, don't knock it under the closet door. This feels nice on my back. This is only 26. I know it requires a lot, but we're literally about to start farming. I'm probably going to go get some arrows so I can farm that bird. A question, though. Did they patch the farm where you're still where Mogwin's Castle is? And you kind of like go through these rocks and you go through this cave and then you jump down and then you just swing and dagger back and forth and then you just farm? Did they patch that? Did you just fall through the map? Did the bird farm still work? Okay. I remember doing that, you know, farm for a bit because you got more, I believe, in the bird farm. All right. Oh, Toma just went live. What is it called? She goes off? There it is, also, live because it's age. Toma, I know where it is. I need a heart. You! Yeah, I think I'll go through these. Yeah, I think I'll go through these. Yeah, I think I'll go through these. Yeah, I think I'll go through these. Yeah, I think I'll go through these. Yeah, I think I'll go through these. Yeah, I think I'll go through these. Yeah, I think I'll go through these. Okay, hi. Sorry. I got distracted because I don't know what to do with you. It's funny. I don't know if you're okay with me bringing it back, but I'm just sitting here. I really wish I had ice cream. Did I already talk about ice cream today? Do I now want ice cream? I'm not going to be my appetite screen back all the time. How are you guys doing? Are you guys okay? He's falling asleep from the dead silence and then he's like, hey guys. You get an EP? You could have gotten an ice cream when you buy groceries. I'm a bit EP too. I can't believe I've been streaming for almost eight hours. Oh. Look, there's also makeup. Okay. You don't need it. Okay. Okay, okay. Hi. Hi. Hi. Sorry, am I leaving? I've been sitting down for a real long time. Hello. Being back. Super EP. 12.15. Time for sleep. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Good night everybody that's going to sleep. Good night. Sleep tight. Don't let the madam bite. Because I will and he'll be very, very hard. I'm working while the stream is on. I don't know why this is so scary. Proof. Proof. Proof. Proof. Proof. Proof. Proof. Proof. Watch that voice. This is top scare. Pro controversial madam. Bye everybody. Have a good night. Thank you for stopping by. If you guys got stuff to do, make sure you go do it. If you have chores to do, make sure you. public. Did your, did your peepee jump? Did your bible jump up in joy? Sorry, that's my, um, hair leaning back in it. Giving yourself the ol' hawk to look? My house? Nice, nice. 8-18 for me. Good for another 4-6 hours. Uh, no, I'm gonna just keep playing. Talk to my brother like that. Man, like, leg needs to pop and I can't pop it. Okay, pop it. Selling your torch yesterday or should I be a mistake? Did I miss your left or dead club? That was good. That was a really fun collab. Make sure you watch the void. I say my bible says so, do you say that? Hee hee hee. Hee hee hee, hoo hoo hoo. Alright, where am I? Look, I'm at my pillow, at my blinky. Let me fix my model. I haven't looked at OBS this entire time, so I, I apologize if my model's like, far the fuck away. Okay, um, let me grab that. Let me do that. Lean back. Make myself a little bit bigger. I'm close. By my clouds. Should we talk for over 4 hours after? Yeah, I know, it's not the same. Danielson says, I know, they fucking took out Azura, like, what the hell? Yeah, I was, I was surprised I kept talking, because I literally was gonna end stream right after the collab and like, go like, fuck about or whatever. And then, um, what was it? Then Azura's like, oh, I think I might talk to my chat and like say bye and everything. I'm like, oh, actually, I should do that too. And talk to you guys about, like, that I'll be leaving for a little bit. Um, and then I just talk for 4 hours. Lipsies. Oopsie-doopsies. Aw, I hope you feel better. I'm sorry I'm in pain too. I almost paid, I know, you guys almost got me to talk another 30 minutes. It's not happening again, I still want to watch a boys episode. Oh la la la la la. How long have I been streaming for? Let's see. I just feel like it's been more than 8 hours. Um, goes by, would you have a phone? Oh wait, now I can see the chat. I do love the app streams. I love the app in two guys. Instructions. You have that effect. Ow, my knee. Uh, I just hit my knee. The app love. Live, live the app love. That was a beautiful shot you guys were able to see. Just people just like hanging out, you know, just chilling. I always love the compare, like the similarities between this and like Christ on the cross. And then it's like Merica, because Merica is like Christ essentially and God. It's very interesting to me, the parallels, the biblical stuff in this game. What's my runes? What the hell? Can I pick them up please? Jesus Christ. What am I doing now? Cool. Oh yeah, I'm going to West of Gaitown. Over here, isn't it? I don't know why I closed it out. I kind of felt Christian fiction is a Jesus thing and not just a cruel way to kill people invented by the Romans. Well it was, like if Jesus was the only one that was crucified, they would do that to just normal people. It's really funny because it's like, I think they discovered they never put them on crosses, but it was just like a giant stake in the ground where you're pinned up above your head and below your legs. The south of the marker? Below this? I think you're right. Yeah, the random dude who's just like, I'm hanging out. He's just like, ah, you'll be with me in heaven in paradise. Although, again, different translations. Sorry, excuse me. Oh yes, the temple fortah. Yeah, that's a lot. Oh, fuck that I got all over here. I need to get a better vantage point. Alright. Let's go. Damn, that horse can jump. Yeah, I remember I grew up reading the King James version of the Bible. You want to go to the next island to the south on the map? Over there? That one? That's not the south, is it? That's the west. Over there? I think that's it straight ahead. Yeah. Okay. Let me go get my fucking... That was weird, where are they? Thank you. That was odd. Oh, no ice. I died there, but you know, go off, sis, I suppose. I guess I won't go down that particular way, because it just killed me. So just step out right here and land properly. Right here, and land properly. Sorry if you can hear Fiamme yelling to herself in the background, she's playing. Bari, where the fuck are you, bro? There you are. You are... You look like a woman. You look like a very comely woman. What's up with that? Thank you. Did I sneeze again? I don't remember. They didn't seem right. They look gross and sickly. We come through the maid in himself. Why are you covered in blood? Why are you covered in blood? Fari's the baddest. Baddest of them all. Ooh, you wanna dance, baby? Oh. It's had a really bad burp. I wonder what happens if, like, you say, I think they're awesome. Wow. All right. I don't really feel like I'm meeting a random person. Um... I forget how do you do this without... I rather do the P-W-E. I'm online, so if I go... Okay. I don't know why I'm here. Ah, I'm stuck. I don't know why I clicked that. I just saw an accept button, and I wanted to click it. Um... Okay. I don't know why I clicked that. I just saw an accept button, and I wanted to click it. Um... Yeah, don't you have to be in offline mode? Uh, let's do it. Oh, I didn't mean to fucking press that. It's fine. What? What? I'm offline. What? Is it working? I forgot to inform you we're still alive. Shit. What do you mean? First Mount Gelmer Bridge Grace? What do you mean? Press any button. Continue. You don't have to be offline, though. I've beaten it offline. Because you just fight the random NPCs. The fuck off. I was running in the wrong direction. Hi! What? But I've done it without invading someone before. Why isn't it letting me do it? There's an NPC I could just kill in the white blood ruins. That's an... You said the Altus Watto? Okay. White blood ruins. My eyes fucking twitching. Quick! Google search! It's writhed blood, by the way. It's not white blood. Why are they so small? Better do it than she being Google. Me and you. Who made you do this? You're spreading under the couch. I think you just did. I think you just did. Ooh, what this blood grease? Spring or cry? I literally just got them four springs from out from under my... They? Fire monks? No. Out from under... my fridge, so... Alright. Where are you at? Fucking dogs. Oh, what's this? Oh, my God. Oh, I'm s- I have them in the wrong thing. Oh, no. Hold on. I forgot I had them in the wrong... May what? Oh, no. What the fuck? I was confused. Should be an invasion sign? Oh, okay. I thought I did this all before. I just don't fucking remember shit. Hmm. What are you eating in that one? Fucking dogs! Oh, you fucking puppy! Flashes. Actually, I'm gonna kill these fucking dogs before I do anything. Oh, what the hell? I'm gonna kill them all because it did the little indication that I did. Anyone else? Anyone else? Alright. I should fold this guy. He is running at me. Jesus. Yeah, I fucking understand. Oh, God. Jesus, stop using beast magic on me. Oh, I didn't mean to hit that. Oh, let's not die. Oh, I forgot you only have limited shit. I totally forgot about that. I totally forgot about this thing. I totally forgot about this thing. Sorry, bro. You can revert the eyes in the mirror in the wrong table. What? The other, the bloody finger quest gives you character weird eyes. Oh! You've ruined your fashion souls, Bill. That's funny. I forgot. Yeah, they get like, I left them because I thought they looked cool. Shibu Pro Gamer? I don't know about that. Yeah, it makes your eyes fucking weird looking. I liked it, though, because my character had really pale gray skin and platinum white hair. So it was cool. Yeah, I'm happy I killed them because then they can't just fucking attack me when I'm standing here. It makes you a star. So, yeah, I like the frenzy frame. It makes your eyes like crazy gold, orangey shit, and I always like that. Who was talking? I don't know. I hear someone like deeply breathing. What the fuck is that? What the fuck is that? Become a witcher. The ucky burn marks aren't a good point. Sorry, I'll stop breathing. What is your name? Oh, you have a dog nearby? I don't think that's what dogs sound like. It sounds like there's a troll below me laughing. Oh, it is like dogs. What the fuck are those? Oh, it's like the Blight dogs. That's terrifying. I'm like, what the hell is that noise? The worm face, bros. Alright, where's the next one? Point me in the right direction. I'll fuck him up. I'll fuck him up. I'll fuck him up. I'll blow him up. Uh oh. It's like that slog that goes really like 10 miles an hour or whatever the heck towards your location. But you never know when it's coming and it's just one of those fucking things. They might want the Patreon link. Patreon link is in the description below, guys. Oh, check out my new audio. It's coming out tonight. I'll figure out which one it is. Wait, hold on. I'll tell you right now. The inevitable snail, precisely. I don't know. I don't know, because like it management puts it up or like strongly schedules it, so I don't know exactly. Put her down? Okay, it's supposed to start loading right now. I thought it was suspended for a second. I was like, yay. Oh. Okay. There is a schedule. Okay. What day is it? What weekend is it? GFTSU, their impressive milk collection. GFTSU is actually into awesome female superiors, but it sounds like that makes me feel good. I'm strawing the techie behind the girls. Uh, yeah. Sure. Wait, guys. Where's the next one? I feel like I'm just replaying the game at a faster speed. Except I'm not faster. Am I done? I have to go top bar, right? I thought I had to kill more than one. I thought I had to kill three. It gave me away those fucking worm things. He just really wanted me to kill that one guy. I thought I had to kill that one guy. I thought I had to get some bloody maiden shit. I have to go back to that church and then dip it in the maiden's blood, probably. Where am I going? Okay, wrong way. That's where I'm going. I don't have any sense of direction. That's the next step? Okay. Blood lady. You're fun to watch. Good luck in the DLC. Aw, thank you. Appreciate it. I'm just a goofy little goobah. Oh, it's your first super on a live stream. I popped you a super cherry. Thank you. Thank you. Hey, Leos. Hellos. Hellos. Do-do-do-do-do-do-do. Yeah. Yeah. Hello. Vore. Vore. I have to speak with you. There's a weird guy. Hi. Is this the guy I gotta come get me? It's so nice. Thank you. I wonder what he looks like without his mask on. Why are you rubbing your hands together like that? Aw, thank you. Yeah, I'm totally not going to kill your god. Dynasty. Because he likes Micola. He likes little... Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Who would have a... I mean, I can't say that. I thought I'd get... How'd I get the... Okay. Ermm. Yeah, it broke a long time ago. I don't know why he's breaking lately. Oh, it broke. Damn, it does not want to work. Usually, I can just refresh the... source. Does my stream die? I think I'm fine, aren't I? Did my stream die? I think I'm fine, aren't I? Yeah, this is where I just want to work. Oh, there we go. Back here. Yeah. I'm trying to fix it. Yeah, this looks gross. I have to make it look like it was before. Because I always have to generate a link. I'll put it in Comic Sans. Okay, looks a little bit wonky. It's funny, because it works. It sounds like I'm talking into a fan. Why does it sound like I'm talking into a fan? What the fuck? It's still not working. It does not want to work. Okay. It's like very delayed. Okay. That's so weird. I wonder why it's doing that. And even if there was a fan, y'all spilling eyelash, why is the microphone... Did it actually bump my... weird? Oh, it was when I was really distant. Oh, it was because I was when I lay down here. Yeah. I sound fine. Oh, that's nice. Why did nobody tell me that since I played the video to find where something was needed? Why didn't anybody tell me that I didn't turn my desktop audio back on? What's wrong with you? Because I may be. I was scared. Oh. Because my voice is cute. You could hear Vari, though? What? What the fuck is going on in my game sound, then? Because it was literally I had like... I had set it as off. That's weird. Why did I still have audio then? Oh, maybe it was like... I don't know. I give up. I don't care that much. It's a show that was muted for me on OBS. Okay. I don't think I'm going to be able to make chat work. Okay. Oh. Now it works. I don't know why that works, although I just kept refreshing it over and over and over again. My first jinx. My toes are cold. Come suck on them. He doesn't know that I have a maiden. Alright, let's go to... Where was it? Er... Backstreet's back. Alright. Can I just fucking... Do you want to get from Missle? Missle? Where was that? It was in Caled, wasn't it? That was near the Frenzy Village. Wasn't that up here? I'm like, where was it? Was it the Second Church of America? Was it the Ernie? Oh yeah, you're right. Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep. The Church of inhibition? I kind of remember... I always... I always... I keep confusing the Church of inhibition where the church is, where the turtle is at. That's why. I don't know why I keep thinking the turtle is here. Thank you. It is... I wish my eye would stop twitching. Thanks for watching. I hope you enjoyed it. Okay. I'm going to... I'm going to... I'm going to... I'm going to... I'm going to... I'm going to... I'm going to... I'm surprised I accidentally ran into the little pillar that has what's-her-face on it. It was like, I'm secretly a salamander person thing area, which is another name I almost called Fia, but I'm like, I don't... I didn't like her that much. What's happening here? That guy doesn't have a head. Oh, what? What's happening? Oh, stop it. I don't like that I can get aggroed right over here. That was just really funny. I just, I always wanted to see if there was a pillow. I need another pillow. Put my arm on. I'm bothered. I didn't even know there's a fucking stake America here. Uh, yoink. Okay, do I have enough to level up? I need 16. Oh, I can get 16. I can get 16. I wish I selected two, but it's fine. Oh, damn it. I didn't mean to talk to you. Luminary Moog! Are you gonna cut off my finger when I do something for this? Sorry, hold on a moment. This looks so funny because he's not really doing anything. Luminary Moog! Off her finger. I thought he was gonna say cream. I always be like, yeah, you know, I got some sweet cream. If you do, I do say so myself. Let me go to here for a second. This is a little nasty. All right. What am I doing? Oh, it's my cat's food. Are you kidding me? I need like 50 runes. It's freedom time. I'm gonna turn the lights like a fuck suit. All he has in question, when he's coming out from somewhere, he was like, oh, and then Raina's still napping. Raina, go eat. Do you accept cat food by any chance? Did he not give me the badge yet? What do you mean the badge? Yeah. I mean the badge. Oh, yeah, you're right. Maybe I need to talk to him again. Maybe I didn't exhaust my... That's right. It's the badge. I don't know why I thought it was the bloody finger. I probably didn't exhaust the dialogue. All right. I don't have a badge. Wow. Oh, that's so crazy. Wow. Wow. Wow. He's in front of me. You must wait. I'm there. All right. Let's see if I can remember. Let's see if I can remember how to get there. It's because I had been sitting there for hours and hours. Pardon me. You guys look like you're doing well. Really nice. So happy for you. Oh, thank you. Sorry. Pardon me. He has a slug. I don't know what you guys are worshipping, but good for you. That was a big boy. Existing. You're just on the walking tip. That's there. I never get what's down here. Oh, yeah, that's right. More sanguine dudes. Oh, hey. What are you doing up here? No. Who will what this? No. Fucking hell. Oh, no. Yeah, I got the mimic. And like, it's not going to even teleport me at the grace. Yeah, okay, I gotta go back because it's annoying. Can you? Like, oh, it didn't let me spawn at the church America. So happy I got a lantern before this. Why is he so fucking fast for no reason? Oh, please. I just want to be like, oh my god. What's this? I need to be over here. What the fuck is this guy? What is this? I'm in the wrong spot. Sorry. Hold on. My ear is itchy. Oh, I don't want to do mob. I'm trying to get to the fucking... ow. I'm going to kill me with the time I get over there. Oh, I went the wrong way. I'm like, this doesn't look familiar. Yeah, yeah, I'm trying to remember where it is. You know, that's where I came from. Why is this guy still aggroing me? You can't see me. I know, I need to go over here. Oh, it's fucking this way. Oh, I forgot. I know where it is. I forgot it's in the opposite direction. Nope, I'm in the wrong spot again. I'm in the wrong spot again. Yeah, because that's it. Oh, yeah, because this is where you get invaded by the fucking white masks. Oh, that's fucking... That's right. Oh, I can't use it until I... where am I going? I can drop it this way, it's fine. I remember getting there. Oh, I can't pick it up. Because you avoid the little skeletors. Yeah, go over here. I remember seeing them and being like absolutely terrified. I forget which way you go. It's not this way, because that's where you get raided. Then you cut through over here. Oh, that's a lie. Yeah. Over here, yeah, that's right. Let's go! Where the fuck did the dudes all go? Oh, they're on this down this way, I forgot. I'm surprised I'm actually doing okay at level 50. I'm not going to lie to you. Before I... I just wanted to grab this first, and I don't really care about my runes. And then I want... So, we heard that it's underground. I want to go to the round table. Oh, wrong way. I thought I almost had it. D, you destroyed. Fuck. D, it's your fault. I'm happy I didn't do that anyways. I don't have any fucking glove word. I wish I could buy glove word. You need to grind to level 140-ish? Yeah. I can't believe you doubted me. How could you, me, of all people? Well, I guess this is where we yapp together. This is the yapping portion of the stream where I grind stuff out. I don't have an eighth. I mean a seventh. God damn it. I thought I had a seven. That doesn't matter. I need to hurry. I need to hurry. Yeah, I don't know why they allow the Dung Eater just to hang out. Like he's like literally generally horrible. How do I use the Mimic? He isn't technically there. That's true, but still. Yapping portion of the can at once. The love sum. Come, Eater. Oh, did I roll into something over here? I remember someone like bowed. I remember seeing someone just like gesture, like email in front of the fucking armor. I think that was so funny. That was always funny to me. I don't know how people email when they leave a message. I never figured that out. Okay, if it's done, you don't have to worry about plumbing. I should probably buy some arrows. Oh, I have just like random shit. I need strength. That's so stupid. Still have a heavy load. Yeah, okay, I'm wearing PJs. Sore seal in two hands. You're probably right. Yeah, that's a good idea. I don't, I don't know if that'll do it though. Does the sore seal give you five? Yeah, it won't be enough. Godric room. Yeah, I got that. If I do that and I pop that, well, it's not like I don't need to use it appropriately. I just need people to just shoot it. Okay. Why can I, can I not dual wield? Yeah, let's do right that then. Can't do it in, oh, that makes sense. I'm like, where is it? I'm just stupid. I'm just gonna do this to make my life easier. What the fuck was that? Left bumper aim. Oh, that's right. Fuck, I miss. Oh my god. Yep, this will be fun. I should probably go buy arrows. What a dummy. You're the gold. Fuck, I don't want the gold scarab because I'm like, wait, usually you get more than this. Oh, where's the gold scarab? Where's the gold scarab? How am I going to eat me? In a dungeon in Caled. Oh, brother, it's, it's, it, is it that one? It's that one, right? Pretty sure it's this one. Behind the dual, yeah, it's by the crystal bitches. We're doing this first before I get the fourth talisman slot. I'm gonna have to cut across to get on the other side here. I may not fucking kill myself. It's over there. It's on the other side. I don't have the dragon barrow. Oh, this one. That's a smoldering wall. What? Isn't the dragon barrow one? That's the great bridge. I think I can make this jump. Well, I definitely can't make the jump. I wish I could just go over here and just like loop up and around. That just makes my life a lot easier. Yeah, you can raise it just a lot closer. Okay, let's do this first, just so I don't freaking kill myself for all. Let's put this bad boy away. She's, she's a little bit big. How's it hanging? That's going pretty good. I'm starting to go nonverbal because I'm EP. No, not like this. Let's not go live instead. Ha ha. He's staring at nonverbal, madam. Ha ha. Did I wake you up? No, wait, I meant to go to the last Christ visiting because it's just gonna teleport me down there. Sometimes I'd purposely throw myself off a cliff to get to a like a steak America. Yeah, because now I'm fucking down here. Wake me up. Wake me up. So save me. Come on. Madam, madam's thing is pretty. I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, what's a fucking bed doll? Oh, that's a fucking sleepy lady. Where am I going? Where did you come from? Where did you go? Where did you come from? Oh my god. Where are you? I just lost 11,000 runes, bro. I don't know what you're talking about. I remember distinctly this happening before too when I was going to this part. Hi, Boomi. How can I help you handsome boy? Are they a bird up here? No. How did I not aggro the thing before? I don't get that. All right, let's just walk. How about that? Let's just walk. Oh my god, Boomi. Oh, oh my kitty. No, please. Why do you walk on my boob? You're still standing on my boobs. Oh my god. Stop. Go away. Why have you done this to me? What are you doing? I'm going to hold you like a baby. Now you're stuck with me like this in baby mode. No, don't leave me. You can't leave now. You're in baby mode. You have to be held like a little baby. And I can give you scratches. Why are you so heavy? You're like this feels like your way as much as a toddler. Why are you so big? Why did you become like that? Why are you looking at me? Why won't you make eye contact with me? He's like leaning away like mother, please. There you go. Let's look into the snack box and see what we got. Shall we, Boomi? Oh, don't attack my headphones. Where's this? Like a little biscuit. It is called Delos and it is cappuccino flavored. Boomi in baby mode. Yeah, Boomi in baby mode is literally just like holding him like he's the baby and it's like he's on his back as the leggies are sticking out. Marina and Boomi are just sniffing each other. Marina, you look like you're about to hop up here. Yeah, cappuccino. How can this happen to me and me? I'm rubbing my eyes. I'm fading. No, Marina, you're in the way. Shut up. I don't need your sass. I didn't mean to press that. Marina, get out. All I see is cat butt and a tail. Oh my god. Marina just kicked the microphone. Why are you flicking your tail? She's mad because I put her on the ground. She's like, what the fuck? All right. Berry carefully. Berry carefully. Jump. You made it. Oh, good luck. I'm sure you're, I don't have to wish you luck because I'm sure you'll pass. You don't need any luck. You got this. A different moment from switching rooms. How is she? I'm fine. I'm here. I'm in the abandoned cave. Feeling abandoned. Okay, I'm just going to run to the boss room. I think I remember where the boss room is. I remember doing the whole farm thing. It was more of the more recent things I had done in the game. All right. Nothing I need to do that. Oh, fuck. I need, I need, I forgot. I need bloodhound step. Oh, that's not the right one. Damn it. I forgot. I forgot that usually I would use just bloodhound step with this. Is it shub over? Just a little bit. I thought the staunching bowl was this for the right ones. Oh, this is going to be annoying. I'm not going to go all the way to do that. To do that, get that ash of war. Yeah, digrow the quick step. No. That's what I meant. I'm sorry. I thought I had the right boluses. I forgot. I had actually prepared for this. I didn't just jump in. Oh, no. We totally have the fungus armor. What are you talking about? I also don't have any fucking boluses. I don't have any fucking cookbooks. I suppose we're going to do a quick store run to Caled. Oh, I can't leave. At least I got the grace to care about. It's funny that you can teleport from like, whatchamacallit. Sounded like something was leaking in my bathroom. Ever get what I was saying? No, I haven't been buying cookbooks. I've just been, I haven't been doing anything. Hi. Okay, so I can get those from you. Oh, it's like I have to do so much shit in order to prepare for the fucking DLC. I should have just played through the game again. I was kidding. It'd be like a hundred hours. You want me to butterfly? Why did I do that? I didn't mean to press that. I meant to press that way. Where do you, I have Reduvia, so I do have a dagger. Oh fuck, but I can't put it on that. Jody Daggers. You don't, you're useless to me. It's a journey and that's okay. I just like, I just, that's why I was always, I didn't know whether or not I wanted to replay Elden Ring just because I'd have to do all this shit. But I'm glad. I'm actually having lots of fun spending time with you guys. I went the wrong way. I know I did it, I'm fine. Okay, Lude. This is more yapping time. Yeah, but I want to get play the DLC guys. You also don't have a dagger. I like how this negates fire, but this is, this is funny. I could get this for my outfit. Bye-bye. Lady from Round Table Shirtle Dagger, you're right. What am I doing? I placed that little cookie thing down somewhere and I don't know where it went. I like never ate it. I just placed it on the ground, or not on the ground. Did I put it back in the box? I swear I took it out. I have no idea where it went. I like put it somewhere. Oh, it was next to me. It's like right next to my butt. I'm like, I wanted to try this cappuccino cookie. Oh, it smells so good. I wish I had coffee to make to eat this with it. Wait, I do have coffee to make to eat this with it. Should I? Should I? Should I make some coffee? Hmm. Let me not do this. Let me not drink coffee at 10 p.m. because then I won't be able to sleep. Am I going the right way? I don't have any fucking money. Wait, let me see. Do you have a fucking dagger? You do. Okay. I didn't see how much it was. How much is it? 400. Okay. I was about to drop 2000 for no reason. 99. Sleep tight. Don't let the madam bite. Just kidding. Let me bite. I always wondered, what was this about? I never used it. This one, like I know when you raid someone, like turns you into the host, but does it like get rid of stuff? I don't know. And then this one as well. You can like just, why would you want to do that? You still look like a normal human. It's a troll item. Oh, it does get rid of your red aura? That's funny. Hi, boo-me. Hi, boo-me. Yeah, get your exercise. Nice job. So like, am I the only person that can see him because he's technically not here? But there's like just a bunch of shit in the library anyways. It's really just like, is anybody like concerned about the absolutely gore that's in this room? I'm really confused. Does nobody smell that? Yeah, it's Dungy. And this guy doesn't do anything. He just follows you around and leans against the thing and gives you a thing. Gives you a e-boat. Look at his little hand. His little hands like holding on to him. I know Rodericka can sense him. Really, only the ones I can't, nobody, do you smell that? Well, you are kind of a skeleton yourself, so maybe you don't smell that. Like, how he has that weapon as his weapon is the skeleton. Gideon doesn't know where he is. He lives right now. Yeah, I'm like, I don't, any, this whole place would smell like absolute shit. Like, I don't, it's phantom, does that look like phantom poop to you? Because like, he looks like phantom. This looks like real shit that I'm sloshing through with real flies. It's, yeah, shit and bodies. The helmet protects tarnished from smells instead of head injuries, impressive. Hiya, Boomi, what's up? Why are you trying to go for my feet? That's the chain. What? What do you want, Mr? I think my headache medications make me sick. Watch me, I've accidentally taken a Tylenol PM so that was a horrible Tylenol, because I've done that before. At least my head doesn't turn anymore. So we're going to go... Wait, where do I get quick step from? Did you take earlier? I'm 99% sure it's just normal ibuprofen. I'm just tired because I've been streaming since 130. Have you seen a single toilet this whole game? I'm pretty sure there is like an outhouse sort of thing. Boomi, what are you up to? Is there something under my computer that you want? You have a toy right there. He's just acting up. The war master shack, yeah. The dagger I just bought has quick step automatically. Am I stupid? I think I am. Anyways, back to the cave. I feel like I'm very tired and I just want to remember you also. I thought I had to get quick step. Oh, it doesn't exactly have it. That's not where I wanted to go. I forgot you should probably like dodge the shit. Oh, like so. I'm just like going through stuff. I'm not waiting for stuff to stop. The head pat emo. I know I should get a head pat emo. Oh, I keep going the wrong way. That's the area of fucking Scarlet Rock. Oh, I forgot the serpent bow is in here. Oh, sorry. I'm getting fucking terrified every time I see a maiden. It's going to go this way really quick. I don't think I went the right way. Oh, fun. Ever get? Is there a grace? No. Raina, let's not hop up on my desk right now. Okay. You don't have to chirp at me. Hi, Raina. You have eye crusties. There's a statue of America? I don't know. Is there? Oh, Raina, you are hurting me with her. No, you can't. She's like gripping my shoulders. I can't take her. You're purring so hard. Raina, I need to put you on the ground. Oh, all right. Well, I have a cat on me now. She is a cleaning baby, but I love her for that. Oh, why did I go this way? All right, tell me something. Just tell me that Boomi's going crazy right now. Time to complete it in one go? Um, sure. I didn't. It's fine. Well, I shouldn't have done that. Can you go after my other thing first? Because I did shit wrong. I accidentally gave him to the tagger. Oh, no. No. It's fine. It's fine. Damn it. I feel like I could have gone that in one go. I know I forgot to. I like walked in and I saw the dagger in my hand. I'm like, no. I'm tired. That's my excuse. I'm tired. Then I gotta do this shit. This will probably take me like one more. I kind of sworn there was like a thing down here. Come on. Come on. Come. No. Don't die. Don't die. No, don't. Oh my god. I think I need to go to bed after this. That's the wrong way. Anyways, what am I doing? What am I stuck on? Yeah. Oh, wrong way. Oh, no. Why don't you just go down? I'm gonna get poisoned. Get out of the fucking way, bro. I have cat hair in my eye and Rena on my lap. There's a rat. I don't always got bit by a rat. I don't know. I'm not just jumping over things. No. Stop. No. Stop. Can you stop, please? I don't have any boluses for that. I'm just gonna die slowly. Oh, this is great. I just think I'd win if I walked in there. I got poisoned grease. I can wait. Try to two hand the moon veil. I'm literally gonna wait until this is done. Why is poison lasting forever? I'm wondering if I should heal. Okay, then I might just heal and just go in and kill them. Okay, yeah, I'm just gonna... I call this one just like rises out of fucking nothing. You guys come over here. Yeah, this is the same damage I'm doing. Oh, I don't even think I needed him. Use your fucking sword, bro. I don't have any more. It's fine. Yeah, I didn't even need the fucking mimic. I just grabbed the mimic just in case. Oh my god, my eye hurts now. I did not need the fucking mimic to heal for that. Okay, I think it's time I go to bed. I'm still fucking poisoned. Let me... So I got the golden scarab. I'm just gonna sit myself here. I don't know why I need to get by fucking arrows. I just want to set myself up for success. I think there was arrows. He had arrows. I know it's almost over. No, it's not gonna be the perfect time. I'm not gonna be able to do this fast enough. I'm already like freaking out. Where's the dude? Oh no, where's the dude? He's over there. No, I'm so tired. I also didn't sleep last night. Hello. Hello. Yeah, I didn't fall. Well, it's not like I don't stay up. I just don't fall asleep. Those are bolts. I need arrows. It's like they know. Well, I will take all of these. Thank you kindly. I think they know that we're gonna go see Moglin. Moglin, Moglin. I don't need arrows for leveling. Do I literally have just enough? I do. That's funny. I need arrows for farming. For a hug. What? I'm so tired. Yeah, I have a serpent bow. Yeah, that's a great bow. This is normal bow. I know that the seeds are cane, but we really don't need that for that. Is that anything on? Oh my god. Fuck. I didn't equip arrows. There. Whoopsies. Nope. That's not what I want. Is it? Oh, fuck. Hold on. Hold on. Nope. Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. I bought normal arrows. What are you talking about? Why is it? Why wasn't it? That was weird. I forgot how to use a bow for a second. Hey, come on. Yeet. Yes, it's me. This is going to take a while. This is going to take a while. Farming for levels. I might do this actually before I go to bed. I haven't caught an icy stream yet. Is it really that down bad? I don't. What? What is the context of that question? Back to you being past the practice of the end. Thank you. Oh, good. I'm so proud. You did great, which was a mob that I don't know. I'm scream. That would be funny. No. Oh, my guts are a little bit longer. Mow dies tomorrow. The tree has a weird hitbox. I usually just, I do it when they're in between the tree. Oh. That's, this is how you know how fucking tired I am, bro. Okay, let me grab my runes. And let's look at my cute little, my cute little outfit, my cute little bow. Greenies in my arms and my eyes are itchy because I think I got like a piece of cat hair and I blame Reina. I'm going to go knock out. Hawaii. I'm asleep. I know my sleep schedule has been so bad lately, guys. I don't even mean it to be, even Boomi's coming over right now. He's like, come on. And then Reina just huffed at him. She goes, and that's this morning. We'll be right at the cause. Oh, perhaps, maybe just a little bit because I need to, I just like staying up and spending time with you. Oh, me. Save. I don't know why you don't want you to meet me. Oh, I'm like off to the side. Do I have any orders for you tonight? Sleep well. I want you to, why are you asking me to tell you to do stuff when I'm half asleep right now? I'm like, I'm falling asleep in my chair. Reina, I'm not open. I want you to get yourself a cat boy outfit and dress up as a little cat. No, I'm kidding. Please don't do that. Remember when I'm sleepy and my voice gets high? Boomi, you're planning a buying cat boy outfit. Anyway, it is for one reason. Um, I don't know. I just hope you guys sleep well. Over six hours. That's, I'm impressed with your attention span because I wouldn't be able to watch myself for six hours. Jesus Christ. Oh, but thank you guys for hanging out with me all day. Like, oh my gosh, or stopping by if you could. Um, Reina, stop being so cute with your big eyes. I wish I didn't have to work. Oh, get some rest. I will. Boomi, do you just kick glitter onto my computer? Boomi, you're gonna mess up. I'm trying to time this properly. It would be at 10, 10. She'd be marathon streamer. I don't mean to. I just like it. Errah. What's fun popping in for a bit of beginning in meow. Yeah, thank you guys for stopping by, stopping in, saying hi. And then we're stopping in, stopping by, saying hi. Oh, maybe I'll, that'll be my outro for streams. Um, can we get, can we get a pet the madam emote? No, you don't get to make demands of me. Excuse you. More Elden Ring tomorrow. Yes, I'll probably stream early again. Actually, I do have to record a special ASMR. And Boomi never, although he's finally actually laid in the bed. Like as I'm getting off, now he wants to be comfy and cute in the bed. If he did it sooner, I would have put the cat cam on. Because I like cat cam for long streams. Um, but, because I already ordered emotes, so I can't like just add another emote to it. So that'll take a while if I do that. Um, because I didn't, did I add a pat emote? I can't remember, because I had 10 emotes that I got that I could order. Um, Strani was telling me, so. I missed, I see barrier stream didn't work, so it was good to still like, yeah, yeah. Um, I'm sorry you missed your stream. Of the recording, did you forget if I have to make a cover? Yeah, covers are hard to make. I'm happy that like, Strani was pretty concise in what she wanted from us and being like, okay, do it like this. I'm like, okay. And it worked out and it sounded at least a little bit of okay. I think my bathroom fan is broken because it sounds like it's rattling. Okay. I was getting distracted by things when I'm like falling asleep in my chair. What do you have to pay to do covers? Um, like, well, we don't get like any copyright because we didn't claim copyright or like, you just, if you're okay with not getting the money, then you just like, you can go through the artist and ask for permission only if you want to monetize it. We didn't monetize any of our music videos so they can't get claimed. Yeah, no, I did not pay Ray William Johnson to sing his song. That would be very cool though, but I'm not making any money off of singing his song. So favorite line from your cover. Butter ass was looking good up in the mom jeans. Or the, or the, I approached her in the checkout line and said, oh, yeah. Oh, baby, what's up? Yo, baby, what's up? That was pretty good. Maybe the girls out. Stop. Don't look at them. Stop. Stop staring. Why are you pointing it out? Why are you pointing it out, bro? You're making it weird. Frick, it's 1012. Oh, you guys tricked me. I'm easily distracted when I'm tired. I love how my eyes glow. Don't you have to go through the music labels to get permission to monetize the music? I just said that. You have to go through the artists. If you want to monetize it, none of our stuff is monetized. Man, I will stay longer the more we talk. Shut up. Yep. 1015. Even. What's everyone doing? No, you don't have to. No, I did not. No, not like that. Tell us about the boy. No, I still have to watch the episode after this and I'm not going to make it. So I'll probably watch it tomorrow morning. I have to go grocery shopping. Maybe I will go grocery shopping just for a couple of days so I can have a couple of days worth of food instead of ordering DoorDash. I'll get some uncrossibles. Is my favorite person in the boys? None of them. I think every character has a hateable trait. Besides Kimiko. So I guess Kimiko is my least hated character. I literally just looked at the talk of the time because I'm like, it's a 17. Okay. Girl, please stop. I hate everyone except you, I guess. Yeah, friend Jesus is annoying sometimes. He just was like, I'm like, why do you, why do you do this? Why do you do stupid stuff? Even MMM? Uh, MMM, everybody makes stupid decisions because I hate all of them because they're very human. Excuse me. Oh no, I didn't mute. I'm being taken advantage of on my eepiness. I'm leaving.
