WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Say anything bad because I'm lying

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
Okay, okay, okay

00:04.000 --> 00:05.000
I'm lying

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
Did my stream

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
Is it going up or still working?

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
I don't know

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
Still?

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
Okay

00:25.000 --> 00:32.000
Yeah, it takes like a hot second for me to even appear like when I guys guys guys

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
It killed my broadcast room

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
You want?

00:37.000 --> 00:44.000
You killed your broadcast room right now like it suddenly like stop streaming and then my my power wash simulator

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
Okay, I replay deleted

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
I'm live right now so don't say anything

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
I'm live right now

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
This is a nightmare

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
Chat, we're so sorry

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Oh god

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
We're so professional

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
It's been awful

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Reflects you don't know

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
How many of them were...

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
Merci, will I make you a new room?

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Yay

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Hold on

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Okay

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
I'll go make myself some tea while we're here

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
No

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
Hey, look at that, look at that

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
Wait, what are you doing?

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
No, you're a li-

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
Okay, you can go make some tea

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
We'll keep-

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
No, we'll just-

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
You've got this stream

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
I don't know how to make some tea

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
You can go make tea, that's fine

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
We need to help Merci

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
Yeah, stream up

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
Guys, we have been at this for 26 minutes

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
We were on power washer for one hour

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
And every time we went past four of the girls connecting

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
The connection started timing out for some reason

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
But if for some reason in power washer

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
If you haven't played the entire campaign

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
It doesn't allow you to have six persons in your lobby

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
And I'm the only one with a finished save file

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
And it was too late to ship all the code information

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
To send it on your stream

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
So, basically, Shibi was like

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
I'll set this one out, you guys just do it

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
And we're like, no, we can't do it

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
The whole point of this is that we're all together in this

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
So then we're like, right, who's got Gmod, right?

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
I don't have it, right?

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Who's got RAF, right?

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
I don't have it, right?

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Who's got this game?

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
I don't have it

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
I was trying my best

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
Shibi was like going through the list

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
She was flicking them pages like next page, next page, next page

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
Jackbox, okay, that won't work

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
Gartik, okay, sure

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
All right, we'll do Jackbox

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
And then, wait, that requires us to screen record discord

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
I'm like, we can't have that

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
We see outrageous things in the discord

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
We don't even have a HR department, so we can't share

03:13.000 --> 03:18.000
So then Gartik Phone, which I've never played before

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
is coming in clutch right now

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
Amy's currently making a cup of tea

03:23.000 --> 03:34.000
Mercy is just getting a room set up for her

03:34.000 --> 03:39.000
because she accidentally nuked her vod of the collab stream

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
It was an hour split

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
This couldn't have gone any worse

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
I think that's pretty on character for us

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
Yeah, if someone can insert that meme and put all of her hairs on it

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
and be like, aren't v-tubers cute when they're almost...

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
That's all I'm gonna say

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
Well, you guys can finish the sentence after that

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
I can?

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
No, I'm kidding

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
No, no, you're not like that

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
The refunds, the snowberries, the billion hearts

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
The harem, I remember

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
I was like, okay, I'm gonna be honest

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
When the harem told me they were called harem

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
I read it as harem, and I was like, that makes no sense

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
for Shibi's character design

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
I do too, I do too

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
I was like, what?

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
I have a harem of so many people

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
that are my little, you know, playthings and clients

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
and they're my harem, and that's hair

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
which is a rabbit

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
but it's not a rabbit, hair and rabbit are different

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
but you know what I mean

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
It's a good pun

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
It's a pun, exactly

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
And they're also called harlots

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
The individuals are harlots, or harlots

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Wait, hold on

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
I thought you said hairless

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Wait, let me...

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
They're hairless

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Some of them aren't, I can tell you that

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Do you still have that thumbnail, Mercy?

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Are we good now?

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
I got a tooth

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
Almost, almost to me

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
Mercy, if you still have that thumbnail

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
if you just throw up the stream

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
Is she gonna throw up on stream?

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
Stream is what you're screaming

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Yeah, it should default to that

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
If you just change to the thumbnail and pick our take

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
I'm chilling, telling herself to stream

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
What are you screaming?

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
I'm dying, I cannot right now

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
Oh, my goodness gracious

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Yeah, how's the volume?

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Yeah, it's my volume, okay

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Can you hear everyone else?

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Miro

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
Who said the harlots are waxed in my chat?

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
The harlots are waxed

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
I need them to be clean and proper

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
I see it, I see it, hold on

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Okay, that's good

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
How do I change the garlic phone?

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
On Manage Broadcast on OBS

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
And it was not doing so bad

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
Oh, they called, we have the column

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
Pichinko, thank you for the 10 members

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
My 10 gifted

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
Don't gift right now

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
This is awful

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Any gifters?

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
Any gifters?

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
At 2 o'clock

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
Yeah, any gifters for my non-monetized channel?

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
Oh, no!

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
How can this happen to me?

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
I was muted the entire time!

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
I can hear you

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
We heard you

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
No, what is happening?

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
Right, mercy

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
What is this?

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
This is awful

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
This is a fever dream, guys

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
This isn't real

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
We're all in beds

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
I guess I should change my stuff now

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Why do we need to change?

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
No, you don't have to change anything

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
As long as the game is on stream, you can change it after stream

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
No one gives a shit when the stream is called

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
As long as we're online right now

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
I'm just doing it because there's like

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
I'm sitting here

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
The girls are running around

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Like everything's on fire

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
And I'm like, it'll be fine

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
We're good

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
We're gonna play some Gartik phone

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
We're gonna have a great time

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
They think the world is gonna end

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
Don't forget to like and subscribe on this stream

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
If you're enjoying your experience as a viewer

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
Smash that bell to get notifications of when we go live

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Smash that bell to get smashed

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Oh, I see

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
Yeah, like with alcohol or something

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Yeah

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Not literally

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
I can't help myself

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
She loves smashing

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Like Nigel Thornberry

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
She just says smashing

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
And that's it, you know

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
She just loves, I see love smashing

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Are we here?

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
No

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
I'm barely here right now

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
Okay, finally

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
We're here

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
I'm sorry for the mess

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
We're good

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
Yeah, we're here

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
She's talking to her chat

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
We, a viewer, have done the holistic approach

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
Where none of us will mute

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
So

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
You're just gonna hear everything

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
All at once

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
That's all

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
We're all

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
It just is a remainder

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
All donations, my memberships

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Or super chats will be addressed

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
At the end of the stream

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
When it's not an absolute cluster

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
Buck of all six of us together

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
But yes

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
The whole premise of the Power Washer

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
Was I was gonna do a gag and be like

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Oh, Viola isn't doing so well

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
We might go bust

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
So everyone put a bikini on

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
And get cleanin'

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
Well, that idea is out the window now

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
So instead we're playing Gartik Phone

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
I've never played it personally

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
She be

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Suggested it and I

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Her word is LOL

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
So let's just take it away

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
I am taking over the company

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
I am the shadow CEO

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Yes

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Okay, do you guys want to start?

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
You ready?

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Woo!

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
Let's do it, let's do it

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
Three, two, one

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
We can finally do it

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Let's go!

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
I know cheating

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
The guy is so chat

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Don't fucking cheat

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
Don't fucking do it

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
I swear it out, beat your ass

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Shhh

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
I don't know

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
How long do I have to do the sentence?

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
I don't know

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Help me out, help me out

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
Reflings don't give out way until it's over

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
This is our secret

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
Oh wait

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
How many

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
How many

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Wait, I don't think they'll know what that is

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
So let me change it

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Hello?

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
Hello?

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
Oh we don't have any time

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
What's wrong?

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
What the

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
Alright

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
We have to draw these now

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
We have to draw these now

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Oh my god.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
Oh my god.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
I'm driving with a...

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
After the mouse.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
You broke the...

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
I can't see.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Don't cheat.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
This is so bad.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
Oh no.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
Oh.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
I've never done this before.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Wait, can I make my pain smaller?

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Is she...

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Oh no.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
Why is he getting drunk?

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Why am I drunk?

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
I don't even know what's happening.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Why are you guys screaming?

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
Oh my god.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Holy fuck.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
How much time is left in my god?

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
The top right corner is the indicator.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Not the sharing.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
I'm an artist.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
Wait, what is this?

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
I brought my drawing tablet out.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
An artist.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Oh my god.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
I'm an artist.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Oh yeah, wait.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
All you can fucking draw about me.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
You're all done.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
I have to look up at the logo.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
We need to witness them.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
Hold on.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
What the fuck am I doing?

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
What is this?

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
What the fuck am I doing?

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
I should whip out my drawing tablet for this.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
Actually, it's better with a mouse.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
It's better with a mouse.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
How much time?

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
No, it's better with a mouse if it looks like...

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
It looks great.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
This looks like a fucking...

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
Okay, the top.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
He's just gonna do something else.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
I'm done.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
I'm done.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
What does text say?

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
I can't tell you.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
These are items.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
That's all I'm saying.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
100% wood.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Why not?

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
These are the chat logs.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
We need to put the chat logs in quick.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
These are the chat logs.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Good answer.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
You guys aren't ready for mine?

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
Let's put that in detail.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
We need some wood detail.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Americans always look in detail.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
What is this?

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
What the fuck?

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
Oh shit, what's the name?

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
There we go.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
There you go.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
What do you think?

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Tilly! Tilly!

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
My gen mates are wild!

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
I don't know what he looks like.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
Look at this Google picture.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
God.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
She be sent so far away.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
I'm away from my wife.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Oh right.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
I don't know what Thornberry looks like.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
Oh no.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
I had to look it up.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
I'm just guessing.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
I'm just going for it.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
What do I look like?

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
I look like this.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
I don't look like that.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Sugar.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Don't question.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
And then I got my planters.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Bunches.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Walk it.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
That's me.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
That's the story I've ever made.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
How do you draw?

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
I don't know.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
I don't know.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
Perfect.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
I don't know how to draw.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
I don't know how to draw anymore.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
That's pretty good right?

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
I think I agree.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
They agree with me.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
I don't know.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
Hold on.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
I need to add some.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Ginger in it.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
There you go.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
That's me.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
I don't know what.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
That adds some hair.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
What?

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
This is awful.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
I'm sorry.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
This is...

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
I don't know.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
Let's draw some hair.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
Oh my god.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Yeah.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Oh my goodness.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Draw his thorn.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
His nose.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
Just google a picture.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
Don't do that.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
I still ate the thorn run.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
That is very nice.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
Thank you.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
My little reeflings are saying I'm a true artist.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Wait, wait. No.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
Emi's hair is not orange.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Emi's ginger.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
I'm ginger?

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
You thought you were blonde?

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
Your hair is orange.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
I thought I was blonde.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
No.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
What the fuck am I looking at?

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
I'm sorry.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
That's my image.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
What does that even say?

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
My wash.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
Me-i-ow.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
Oh, meow.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
Oh my god.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Meow.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
Which one of you speaks Spanish?

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
That's French.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
That's French.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
Oh lord.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
What?

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Oh, how am I supposed to draw that?

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Jesus Christ.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Did we even have...

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
What do I look like?

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Oh wait, I can't even draw the fucking toilet.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
Alright, hold on.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
What do I even look like?

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
This is terrible.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
I'm out.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
This is so hard with the mouth.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
Wait, this is not feet.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
This is armpits.

17:17.000 --> 17:21.000
We're like, we're grabbing onto the ground for dear life in this one.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
Right, armpits.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
So...

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
I don't know.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
I like throwing in words that they don't know.

17:30.000 --> 17:34.000
Because none of you guys know like some English phrases.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
Or some like jokie phrases.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
So I can already...

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
What I'm hearing is that a lot of you guys are misinterpreting what I've written.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
And it's very funny.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
It's going all over his back.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
It's not looking good.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
How do you draw an angry mouth?

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
Oh, there we go.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
And then...

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Armpits!

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
We need to draw...

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
This is amazing.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
What does the Walmart logo mean?

18:10.000 --> 18:14.000
Your armpits has become sentience.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Walmart.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
I'm not even going to explain to Mercy.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
I'm not even going to...

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Oh wait, don't your toilets have like...

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Oh wait!

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
I don't know what's wrong with him.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
I don't know.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
It just makes it better.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
It makes it worse.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
It makes it worse.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Oh my god.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
Oh my...

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Uh...

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
He's just like...

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
This is too fucking funny.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Perfect.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
I think that works out.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
There we go.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
The radiation.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
I can't wait to see everyone.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
All according to plan.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Now we'll get to see everything.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
I'll do manual.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
There's going to be no voiceover.

19:22.000 --> 19:26.000
And then we'll do beginning from the end.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
Okay.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
So...

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
So I said,

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
I see with Nigel Thornberry's face

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
saying smashing.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
I mean...

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
And Mercy too.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
I'm very old.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Smash weak.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
I'm strong.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
I'm strong.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Oh my god!

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
I love it.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Why does she look like...

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
Oh my gosh, she looked like that!

20:25.000 --> 20:29.000
Okay, Imi, go ahead.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
Oh no.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
Oh boy.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
You're honest, you wanted it.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
And then there's Chris Hansen.

20:39.000 --> 20:44.000
And I said, oh, she said it's going to jail for the crime scene on date.

20:44.000 --> 20:48.000
Oh no!

20:48.000 --> 20:53.000
Oh shit, I'm going to jail.

20:53.000 --> 20:59.000
Oh my god!

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
Oh my god, full circle!

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
I love it, I love it!

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
That actually worked out.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
Why does your OG Santa such a fat cock?

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Jesus fuck.

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
Because he loves me and he's dead gross sick.

21:15.000 --> 21:19.000
It grew six times that day.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
All right.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
Sestrani's.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
I'm sorry.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
Oh my god.

21:27.000 --> 21:34.000
Merse, it's cheesy, fester and fat.

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
I feel like her feet is actual cheese.

21:37.000 --> 21:43.000
I know.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
Hey, I like that pull.

21:46.000 --> 21:52.000
And I wrote stinky peats, which is his feet, but little slang.

21:52.000 --> 21:58.000
And then she drew pits.

21:58.000 --> 22:03.000
Oh my god, that's too good.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
Is she cutting out?

22:05.000 --> 22:09.000
She's screaming so loud.

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
Azura.

22:12.000 --> 22:16.000
Azura!

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
I see, very good artist.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
I got it from fucking AC.

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
Thank you.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
What does that even mean?

22:26.000 --> 22:31.000
When your job is a poo, so when your poo hits your prostate on the way out.

22:31.000 --> 22:35.000
Oh, a job is a poo?

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
What is this?

22:39.000 --> 22:43.000
Is he me sucking?

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
Have you suckered on them hot too?

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
Oh wait, has she given a blowjob?

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
That's what it looks like.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
That's what it looks like to me.

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
Oh my god.

22:57.000 --> 23:01.000
Oh my god.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
The drill.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
The drill is so good.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
Oh boy.

23:07.000 --> 23:11.000
Over some pie.

23:11.000 --> 23:15.000
Oh my god, that's pretty good.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
That's cute, I love that.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
That's a really cute toy.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
How is that a cat?

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
How is that a cat?

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Meow.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
Meow winky face guys, come on.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Okay, it's a winky face.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
I was like, what is meow us?

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
I was like, who is this Spanish?

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Niko with.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
We are so good.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
That's good, that's good.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
I love that.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
Okay, this makes sense.

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
This makes sense of what on earth we were drawing.

23:58.000 --> 24:01.000
See, that's the checkout and like that's items on the shelves.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
I worked really hard.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
Oh my god.

24:06.000 --> 24:09.000
Oh this is a good diaper.

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
I see understood me.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
Why is he praying?

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Oh my god, praying for the den full.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
I love the details.

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
Taking a mind to shots.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
Honestly.

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
Why is it coming out of his back?

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
It was good everywhere.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
It's like on his back.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Yeah, I can't.

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
Toilet stall gap.

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
Because that's all I see about when I like see American memes.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
They're like, oh the toilet stall.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
The toilet gap is so big.

24:44.000 --> 24:47.000
You can literally look at people's eyes through it.

24:47.000 --> 24:50.000
Do you guys want to play a different version?

24:50.000 --> 24:53.000
Oh no, we have them closed because you know it's a private time

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
and you're very vulnerable taking a big job.

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
So yeah, it's actually closed everywhere else in the planet.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Oh you're so lucky.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
I had people peeking at me in high school through the stalls

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
and I'm like, can I help you?

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Me too.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Oh no, is there a DC?

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Is there a check?

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
Is there a DC check?

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
Are you in the lobby? Do you need to reload the lobby?

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
It's gonna do it on its own usually.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
No, I'm gone.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
The link should be in the discord.

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
Don't show your fucking screen on the discord.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
They'll see everything.

25:30.000 --> 25:34.000
They'll see all of our naughty photos we just sent to each other.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
It's mostly memes.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
Any memers?

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
I mean, to be fair, we did share...

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
We did share some ugly memes.

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
We did share some smoky nudes of ours.

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
They've seen my titties.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
I started roleplaying as the girls with my nudes.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
I was like, this is what Evie would do.

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
This is what Acey would do.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
Discord is so chaotic.

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
Okay, real though.

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
But also, I did snort out my tea.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
It like went down the wrong hole and went out my nose.

26:11.000 --> 26:15.000
Wow, Marcy out here snorting tea.

26:15.000 --> 26:19.000
Gotta lay off, that's a stosteroad.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
It hurts so much.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
Yeah.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
Are you in game?

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
Yeah.

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
She's like so in my ears.

26:30.000 --> 26:35.000
My cliz getting another heartbeat right now every time she talks.

26:35.000 --> 26:39.000
I have a turn with her eye around this.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
I love her landing.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
And my fingers turned out like that.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
Oopsie.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Oopsie.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
I don't know.

26:50.000 --> 26:55.000
I feel like Azura could do a really good Jennifer Coolidge impression.

26:55.000 --> 26:58.000
Jennifer Coolidge.

26:58.000 --> 27:03.000
I don't know Jennifer Coolidge's impression.

27:03.000 --> 27:06.000
She was like, wait, you don't know Jennifer Coolidge.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
Jennifer Coolidge.

27:09.000 --> 27:15.000
I have such big titties.

27:15.000 --> 27:19.000
Oh my god.

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
Oh my god, Jennifer Coolidge.

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
Speaking of your chat for the Rizzler.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
That's so good.

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
Why are we opening our got for the Rizzler?

27:30.000 --> 27:34.000
Drop the bass, plow, plow.

27:34.000 --> 27:39.000
Azura, click that link in the general discord to ring the bell.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
Is it not letting you back in?

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
Have you been reading more?

27:44.000 --> 27:51.000
All I hear is screaming.

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
Your make cuts out with your eyes, Azura.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
So it just goes.

27:56.000 --> 28:00.000
What's happening?

28:00.000 --> 28:04.000
It's constantly loading.

28:04.000 --> 28:09.000
It's literally, let me do another invite.

28:09.000 --> 28:14.000
Wait, if I, when you guys see the discord, if I open it up,

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
okay, you guys can't see it.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
Perfect.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
No, if you do, if you do capture.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
I shouldn't see anything else.

28:20.000 --> 28:24.000
I would close the window capture in the, in the OBS just in case.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
Yes, you're going to turn off.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
Are we restarting a new lobby?

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
A new lobby?

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
I think you're still inviting us lobby.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
A bit of all.

28:35.000 --> 28:38.000
Are we, are we going to another room?

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
I don't know.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
I only see one of you.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
No, on mine.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
Sorry.

28:47.000 --> 28:52.000
She's in, she's in.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
Okay, which one should we play?

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
So you got normal, which we just did.

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
Knock off, keep yourself focused, try to replicate the drawings

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
while the clock gets faster.

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
Animation, create an animations in a collaborative way.

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
Icebreaker, play with a sentence, ask questions and have fun with other drawings.

29:08.000 --> 29:12.000
Exquisite co-ops, create surrealist characters connected by the top of the drawings.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
Don't know what that means.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
Hold on.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
I have one.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
Burp friends, have a good time with that.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
Compliment, complete the sketch.

29:19.000 --> 29:22.000
Start with basic lines and see other players' interpretations.

29:22.000 --> 29:26.000
Masterpiece, create a piece of art, play in a single turn with no time limit.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
I feel like story would be funny, right?

29:28.000 --> 29:31.000
A narrative using only the previous sentence as a reference.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
Yes, okay, okay, story, story, story.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
You want to do story?

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
Yeah, let's try story.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
Wait, do I have to write a full story or just a sentence?

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
Just a sentence.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
Just one sentence.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
Okay, okay.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
Do you like write the whole story or no?

30:00.000 --> 30:03.000
No, you have really limited characters.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
I don't know it.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
No!

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
What did you do?

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
There's time, there's time.

30:14.000 --> 30:17.000
Yeah, I got 15 seconds, love.

30:17.000 --> 30:20.000
Oh my god, I wanted to write more.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
You can only write one sentence.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
I feel like I should be drunk.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
What is this?

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
We are not beating the caca allegations with this.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
No, we're not.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
What the fuck is happening?

30:47.000 --> 30:51.000
Oh, they're going to know this is me spelling it because I didn't use a Z on that.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
I'm just going to leave it like that.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
Yep, I'm sending it.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
I'm not even spell checking.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
Lack of spell check is good.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
Fuck it.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Five seconds.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
Fuck it, I'm bad at stories.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
What is this?

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
It's mine!

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
Oh, the sentence is so small.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
I want to give a bit more.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
I think it gets shorter over time.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
I want to feel it vibing.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
I couldn't write until, fuck.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
What?

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
What's that?

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
What's that?

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
Let's see.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
Oh no, what the fuck?

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
Fuck, I'm so bad at this.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
Her name.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
It's funny because...

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
Oh, I hate this.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
I can't think of any names.

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
The Reeflings, the Snowberries, the Snickers,

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
the Pin Pals,

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
the Blean Harps, and the Herum.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
I'll get to see this unfold.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
And we're all just taping like...

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
Fuck it, I don't fuck around.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
Wait, is that the fucking...

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
And...

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
You watch fucking...

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
Big Bang Theory?

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
Wait, that's a nice spell.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
Paris.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
Fuck!

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
Give me more!

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
WolfQuest reference, though.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
I need more letters.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
I need more like...

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
Amazing!

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
What?

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
Amazing!

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
Ten minutes pen song lyrics!

33:12.000 --> 33:15.000
They jerk so hard, motherfuckers want to find me!

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
That sounds like Stevie!

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
No!

33:22.000 --> 33:25.000
They jerk so hard, motherfuckers want to find me!

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
Wait, I don't know these lyrics.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
This...

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
This agency...

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
We can't just...

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
I spelled it wrong, but that's the point.

33:37.000 --> 33:40.000
I hate that they don't give you enough to write.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
It's like...

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
Not enough.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
Fuck off.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Oh boy, okay, let's see what's happening.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
I'll do the auto.

33:54.000 --> 33:58.000
So how about everybody reads their own story, like whoever did the first line.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
Okay, cool.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
Okay.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
Oh, okay, I go first.

34:19.000 --> 34:22.000
They also wanted some of the juicy.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
Ew, cooties, you're not good.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Why do we both start the same?

34:38.000 --> 34:41.000
There was a polar bear princess who was trying to fit in too.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
Oh.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
My love was stronger than any four in addition.

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
They couldn't stop jerking my love for jerk.

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
My jerk still hid my love for jerk.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
I didn't know I had finished it.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
I was like, this agency is crazy.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.000
Ding ding.

35:06.000 --> 35:09.000
Ding ding, that was supposed to be the song, like ding ding.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
Ding ding, ding ding, ding ding.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
Ding ding ding.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
That was so hard.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
Strawny, who was in Paris?

35:22.000 --> 35:25.000
There was a beach of agency that was lit.

35:26.000 --> 35:29.000
They all couldn't control their urges.

35:31.000 --> 35:34.000
So they danced the pee-pee dance until they could.

35:35.000 --> 35:40.000
And then finally, they peed everywhere on the floor,

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
the walls, the bed, the kite.

35:44.000 --> 35:47.000
We're all filled with piss everywhere, but he loved it.

35:47.000 --> 35:52.000
The fact that he was not even a piss prompt before AC came out with that.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
AC couldn't hold it.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
AC put him back to piss.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
I'm dying.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
I'm dying.

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
This is so good.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
Once upon a time, there were whores.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
They were the elitists of whores.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.000
They had a wild west.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
They all had really cute cowgirl.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
Pussycat, so cute.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
So fuzzy.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
Pussywarm.

36:22.000 --> 36:25.000
Big bang theory, more like bang bang your mom last time.

36:26.000 --> 36:29.000
You keep my mom out of your damn mouth.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
He's turning to an argument.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
That's the story.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
That's the time they were like...

36:38.000 --> 36:39.000
She's choking.

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
Oh no.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
Oh no.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
Oh no.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
I'll save this time.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
I can't.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
I can't.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
I can't.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
I can't.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
I can't.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
I can't.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
I can't.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
I can't.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
I'm turning from shit to cum.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
Oh, my face hurts from laughing.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
This is so bad.

37:14.000 --> 37:17.000
And now you guys know why I rate the scripts.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
Why am I?

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
I got me in a zero row to buddy each other.

37:21.000 --> 37:26.000
She was sad because she realized she didn't have a prostate.

37:29.000 --> 37:32.000
Why do I keep talking about shit all of that?

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
Oh, great.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
She became so bad.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
I hate this.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
Fuck no.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
No.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
I didn't want to be pregnant by Sonic.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
Azura.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
Azura, do you have a mic filter on?

37:49.000 --> 37:50.000
I can never hear you.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
Turn that mic.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
Get that steel-

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
See that steel series.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
Oh, fuck.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
If I fart, I'll get everybody's stream.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
You can't.

38:09.000 --> 38:12.000
I deafened so you guys couldn't hear it on all five channels.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
What is happening?

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
Can't wait for the vote if they survive.

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
Yeah, these votes.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
They'll be fine.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
Don't worry about it.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
You guys want to play this one?

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
Or do you want to try another one?

38:25.000 --> 38:26.000
Another, another, another.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.000
New one, new one, new one.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
Start with an incomplete drawing each turn.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
Please, please.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.000
No more shit.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.000
No more shit in piss.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
No.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
No more shit in piss.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
No promises.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
Each one.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
I didn't even do any shit in piss stuff.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
It was you guys.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
Each turn is called compliment.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
Compliment.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
All the actions are a mystery.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
Drawings and sentences are hidden during the game.

38:49.000 --> 38:50.000
You can't hear Mercy.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
Mercy test.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
Mercy test?

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
Sorry.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
Sorry.

38:54.000 --> 38:57.000
I was muting because I was coughing because I was slapping my side.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
Oh, okay.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
Okay.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
Mercy test complete.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Do you want to do compliment?

39:06.000 --> 39:07.000
What is that?

39:07.000 --> 39:08.000
Complete the sketch.

39:08.000 --> 39:11.000
We draw on each other's drawings, basically.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
I wish I could do that.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
Sure.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
I think that would do it.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.000
Yeah.

39:15.000 --> 39:18.000
Can't wait to draw so much piss and shit.

39:18.000 --> 39:19.000
Oh, God.

39:19.000 --> 39:20.000
That's some basic lines.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.000
Okay.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
I'll do some basic lines.

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
Okay.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
I'll do this.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.000
Maybe I could just...

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
Maybe I'll do some basic lines.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
Okay.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
All right.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
Now I'm just going to draw a bunch of dicks.

39:43.000 --> 39:44.000
I like it.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
I'll leave it like that.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
Castle.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
No!

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
Are you joking?

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
What's that?

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
What happened?

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
You know exactly what you did.

39:57.000 --> 40:00.000
And no, I don't have the strength to resist.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.000
What?

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
Wait, I got it.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
I got it.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
I can make this.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
I can salvage this.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
This is the back legs of it.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
And then this is its huge milkers.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
And then this is its legs.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.000
There you go.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
Only a few more left.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.000
Yeah.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
You're so dirty.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.000
Reflins.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.000
Don't be so dirty minded.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
Honestly.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
Reflins.

40:29.000 --> 40:32.000
I'll get the girls to tell you off if you don't behave.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
That's shocking.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
You guys don't have innocent eyes anymore.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.000
Cute.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.000
Rude me.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
Wait, quiet is working hard.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
Wait, am I supposed to finish this off?

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
Are we supposed to finish it off?

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
I think so because it's given us tons of time.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
Hold on.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
Oh, okay.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
I fixed it.

41:03.000 --> 41:04.000
I fixed it.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
A big fish up bra.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
Oh my god, I've just made shimmy.

41:13.000 --> 41:14.000
What the hell?

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
My name.

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
Oh wait, that's a thing.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
Oh no, that looks like...

41:22.000 --> 41:23.000
Dang it.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
Let's just do the pencil.

41:26.000 --> 41:27.000
Here we go.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
I saved it.

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
I saved it.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
Baby, give you a lot more time for the second one.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
Yeah, you're to finish it.

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
You're to finish it.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
Ah, you need to finish it.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.000
Okay, I'm fucking stupid.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
Never mind.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
Okay.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
So am I.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
Don't worry.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
I saved it.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
Lemo girl.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
I can't write.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
Hell.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
Let's put some nice shading in.

41:53.000 --> 41:56.000
To make this look extra beautiful.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.000
Wow.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
Let's put lipstick on.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
Yeah.

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
So beautiful.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
I saved it.

42:11.000 --> 42:12.000
They prank him.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
I think this is the best I know.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
Maybe a bit of fluff on Matteo.

42:18.000 --> 42:19.000
Oh, wait.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
Who drew a pair of hairy ball sacks?

42:24.000 --> 42:25.000
What?

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
You're supposed to add the shaft.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
I really know what I want to do,

42:37.000 --> 42:40.000
but I know I shouldn't do it because we're on YouTube.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
I'm fixing this.

42:44.000 --> 42:45.000
Oh, no.

42:46.000 --> 42:49.000
I can't think of one thing.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
This is amazing.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.000
Oh, wait.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
Maybe hold on.

42:53.000 --> 42:54.000
Hold on.

42:54.000 --> 42:55.000
I got it.

42:55.000 --> 42:56.000
I got it.

42:56.000 --> 42:57.000
Hold on.

42:57.000 --> 42:58.000
I got it.

42:58.000 --> 42:59.000
I got it.

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
Fuck.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.000
How do I go back?

43:01.000 --> 43:02.000
Okay.

43:02.000 --> 43:03.000
Fuck.

43:03.000 --> 43:04.000
What is this?

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
They've got a big head.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.000
Look at it.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
Oh, I've drawn them too.

43:11.000 --> 43:12.000
Let's practice.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
This is so fucking good.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.000
Let's fucking go.

43:21.000 --> 43:22.000
I'm trying so hard right now.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
I can't even think of anything to say.

43:29.000 --> 43:30.000
Oh, my gosh.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
Use your imagination.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
Use your imagination.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
I can't even think of anything to say.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
I can't even think of anything to say.

43:45.000 --> 43:46.000
There you go.

43:46.000 --> 43:47.000
Thank you, all.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
I'm so proud of you.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
I'm like...

43:56.000 --> 43:59.000
We need to be nice to the earth people.

43:59.000 --> 44:02.000
Your laugh is so cute.

44:03.000 --> 44:04.000
Thank you.

44:04.000 --> 44:12.000
I think I did my really well, yeah, it's a water bottle

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
I saved the pair of all sex

44:29.840 --> 44:31.840
Did you make it into a dog

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
Just work. I don't know

44:36.320 --> 44:38.400
Can you do better shut the fuck up? I

44:41.040 --> 44:43.040
Love when you do that

44:53.120 --> 44:55.520
You're asking me not to draw a vagina with this

45:04.000 --> 45:08.240
How do I make this how do I save this

45:21.360 --> 45:23.600
Okay, I won't draw that because that would be

45:25.680 --> 45:28.160
Oh my god, I just realized all this instead

45:29.120 --> 45:34.800
Merci snippets like fucking girl goo from star wars

45:36.720 --> 45:38.720
Oh, wait, no, is it heartbreak on the chair?

45:40.400 --> 45:43.600
You thought women were less immature than men you're wrong

45:48.720 --> 45:53.760
I wasn't gonna draw a coochie or a woman giving birth, but I'm not gonna I'm resorting to this instead

45:54.720 --> 46:00.000
I've literally don't know what the fuck I'm doing right now. There we go. Wait, hold on. I don't know

46:01.760 --> 46:03.760
Oh my god, I have time

This is a really specific reference and I don't know anyone can I get it but

47:34.000 --> 47:35.680
There used to be a

47:35.680 --> 47:43.440
Flash game where your guy was on like a snowboard. I love that game. Yes. I want you to literally just drawn that

47:44.400 --> 47:46.400

01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:50.400
literally

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:51.840
because um

01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:53.680
Oh someone rated the feature bridge

01:05:53.760 --> 01:06:00.000
They were like the only thing that would have been it better is if you let them design their models like from the start

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:03.680
I'm like, bro. It took me a fucking year to get here. Like, oh my god. Give me

01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:07.120
It takes forever to

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.480
Draw and rank a vtuber model. Yeah

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:15.760
You can ask him me. She knows how to she knows how to do it. It's a lot of work

01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:24.720
Yeah, there's only a select few corpos that will let you do that

01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:31.920
It literally takes so long. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. This is wrong. Usually ones that have like artists in house as well

01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:35.760
Yeah, we don't

01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:44.640
Most companies if not all of them say first you will have pre

01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:47.600
pre-made

01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:54.160
Pre-made so it's not actually standard for people to choose. Yeah, it's really not. Yeah

01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:57.840
That's why it's usually they cast for the roles

01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:01.840
You have to fit the character they're looking for and have the voice

01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:09.920
It's magic

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:12.560
You know

01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:28.720
Oh

01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:31.520
What is this?

01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:34.960
Um, oh

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:36.960
Okay

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:44.480
Okay, now we have to draw it. Are we ready?

01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:49.200
Yeah, um, no, but I guess I have to be

01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:56.720
Even if I'm not it's okay

01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:02.560
Just draw it your way and that's the fun part. Yeah, very nice

01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:07.040
I've already forgot which position everyone

01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:12.560
This is so bad

01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:21.920
Sorry, we flinch honestly, I would talk more but this takes so much brain power. I'm literally I'm just like

01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:24.880
I'm so brain dead like

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:35.520
I'm reading chat. I'm reading everything, but I'm not responding. I'm so sorry because the everyone see what you're all saying

01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:38.560
I'm just really in this

01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:44.160
I feel like I'm just fucking losing it

01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:51.360
Oh my god, wait, I forgot I forgot there was a shorter time

01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:54.560
That's far too short. So it's

01:08:55.200 --> 01:09:01.200
This is why it's chaotic. Why was the other one longer? I don't remember what sugar. I didn't want to do that

01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:04.080
Um

01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:10.320
Oh my god, what

01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:24.880
Oh, fuck the time

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.160
We draw this as fast as we can

01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:31.120
Oh

01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:41.520
Can't remember what it looked like

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:47.040
Is there supposed to be someone in a pirate boat by the way because I don't think I saw it

01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:51.040
If there was supposed to be a person in it, I don't know. It's already they've already gone

01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:53.760
There's a person

01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:57.280
It's supposed to go really fast

01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:00.640
Oh my god

01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:03.040
Okay, that's that's easy enough

01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:11.760
Okay, gotta go fast gotta go fast

01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:23.520
Oh my god, I am so sorry

01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:30.160
It's a little sun

01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:44.400
Okay, okay, okay, we can do this we can do this

01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:50.800

01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:56.000
The great part is that we are all panicking

01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:00.400
No, no, no, no

01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:06.400
What even is that?

01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:16.240
Okay, this is easy this is easy this has to be miss men's this has to be men's

01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:26.560
Man this looks like shade but a while

01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:30.160

That's a little campfire

01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:53.960
I gave him faces at the end of the day or all just

01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:01.120
Okay, this is good this stage

01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:03.120
The states

01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:28.880

One more

01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:37.520
Uh

01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:47.200
All the actions are a mystery drawing and sentences are hitting during the game

01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:54.080
What's secret secret seems rough. I've never done that one before

01:15:56.320 --> 01:16:03.040
Okay, we'll try it. All right last round boys last round. Okay. Okay. Okay. Um

What it is where it is that's so fun

01:16:57.520 --> 01:16:59.520

01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:02.480
Oh, no, no

01:17:56.560 --> 01:17:58.560
Okay

01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:05.920
Uh

01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:25.760
I don't know what else to draw that's that's exactly what I drew I think

01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:32.320
This is a vain reference. I don't know what the fuck i'm doing

01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:35.520
Locked in

01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:37.680
I locked in did I give wait

01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:42.880
That's about that wrong. Wait, did I give them bodies? I don't think I gave them bodies. Oh my god

01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:45.440
I don't even know where they are

01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:46.640
I don't know

01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:48.640
I'm taking a shot in the dark

01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:51.680
Where so you know what that is going to be interpreted as

01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:56.240
And will I stop the creative flow? Do you stop?

01:18:56.720 --> 01:19:01.360

01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:34.160
Someone had to stroke whoever drew this one. Hope you're feeling okay. Hope you're doing all right. Make sure you hydrate

01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:37.120
Fuck I didn't have enough time to write it

01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:40.480
Uh, man, how do I even draw this?

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
This is uh

That's the tongue and then this is literally everyone

01:19:57.920 --> 01:20:01.920
I don't know where the body is. This is the fuck am I drawing?

01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:18.000
I need like motion swipes as well and a little arrow to indicate it's true. Yeah, I know what I'm doing. I don't know

01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:23.840
And then yeah, there we go. I think I drew it correctly. A little bit of lipstick. Ah, where is it?

01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:43.680
I can't wait to see the end of this. This is like great. This will be a great thing for the ages

01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:08.800
That's like two feet apart

01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:14.560
Two feet apart

01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:22.400

01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:16.160
Oh

01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:23.440
I'd say let's say thank you for the $10 tip from anonymous and thank you to boy

01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:31.280
For the $1 tip six vods sure at least one of them stays up. I'm keeping mine up. You can't put me down

01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:36.160
All right, I don't know why I was selling like Jamaican. Um

01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:42.080
But yeah, I'm gonna end stream and then I'm gonna start another one. I really got a fucking poop. Um

01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:49.600
Oh my lord

01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:55.040
Oh my god, it was it was so frustrating because we were all trying to get power washed into the work

01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:57.040
but yeah, like as strani said when um

01:29:58.000 --> 01:29:59.840
when there was like

01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:01.840
if we tried to add, uh

01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:07.280
All six of us if there was like five or four of us we could make it work

01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:13.680
But like six like it just it kept crashing like not even like it just wouldn't connect. I don't know if it's because

01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:17.840
Um where strani is we couldn't connect properly because she was hosting

01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:20.320
Uh

01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:22.720
I was like we were so bummed so I'm like, don't worry

01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:26.720
They're like, do we need to end it today? I'm like, no, we don't need to

01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:29.120
postpone it

01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:34.960
We'll just play something else. And so I ran through like some things. I'm like, okay, gary's mod we can play hide and seek

01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:39.040
Or prop one. They're like none of us have it. I'm like, okay. Uh, what about if we do this? They're like, okay

01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:40.960
We don't have that. I'm like

01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:46.960
Okay, what if you guys get this? Okay. What about jack box because you guys also said jack box and then we realize

01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:50.320
Oh, but you would you would all kind of have to be watching my stream

01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:53.520
And I'm like, I don't want to take the entire viewership of this collab

01:30:54.160 --> 01:30:55.040
um

01:30:55.040 --> 01:30:57.040
because and it would be kind of

01:30:57.360 --> 01:31:00.640
Uh, I don't even think it would be possible for us to stream our

01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:02.800
respective

01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:03.920
um

01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:07.840
Windows properly because you have to like answer everything from a phone anyway

01:31:07.920 --> 01:31:13.120
So it doesn't it wouldn't really work out but we might try to work out the kinks of that another time perhaps. I don't know

01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:14.960
um

01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:16.960
I feel like that's a good like

01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:23.120
Uh stream with like, uh, you guys because it's a little bit easier because you guys all look at your own phone or whatever

01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:25.680
um, and then

01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:28.720
Yeah, it all ended well because I was like, oh wait, what's that freaking

01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:31.360
Pictionary like game

01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:36.480
And I was like isn't there like garter phone. I'm like, okay perfect. I've never played guard like I've never played garter phone before

01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:38.960
um, but

01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:40.640
like

01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:45.120
I will always I just noticed strani is a piece of pizza. Uh, I will always

01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:50.800
Like because I could tell strani was getting stressed. I'm like, don't worry. We'll be fine. We got this

01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:55.680
Um, we don't have to postpone it. We don't have to just like we don't have to cancel anything

01:31:56.080 --> 01:31:58.080
I was gonna I what I wanted to do

01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:02.720
I wanted to do like csgo commentator

01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:07.280
Of like them playing power wash like really badly and just like not be in it

01:32:07.280 --> 01:32:10.400
Like so you guys wouldn't have like I was just would have still streamed

01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:14.560
What you guys wouldn't have gotten my viewpoint. Uh, I would probably just like

01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:20.560
react stream to like strani's uh, or like emmy's thing. Um

01:32:22.480 --> 01:32:26.000
The northerline crew do jackbox a lot. Yeah, so I'm like, I know it's possible

01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:29.920
But we just don't we'll probably break up the kinks for that. Um

01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:36.400
But yeah, everything worked out fine. I'm glad we had lots of fun time

01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:41.200
I always love hanging out with them. I also just like didn't want to postpone hanging out though

01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:47.760
Because we hadn't um, like we'll talk all the time in like chat, but we haven't like, um, played a game together in a bit

01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:52.400
So I was like, oh no, I want to I want to hang out with my girls

01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:55.760
Oh, like anything happened

01:32:57.120 --> 01:33:02.720
Yeah, what honestly you would have you would have liked what strani had um set up for

01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:09.120
Power wash because we were gonna do like a little q&a and like the little skit where we're trying to like make money

01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:16.480
Because nobody watches us or whatever. So we just resort to power washing. Um, but yeah, we're we are

01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:19.600
Like I think we all have really good chemistry

01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:26.880
As a group we're all just so goofy together and I I just love it so much like I wouldn't I wouldn't ask for

01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:31.120
any other group of hilarious freaking girls because

01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:39.120
Like we all like some of us will surprise each other like the freakiest shit like just like like evi today like just

01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:41.120
doing the most

01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:43.120
silly drawings

01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:45.920
In like

01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:48.480
It's just fun

01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:54.480
We need to get I see more hobbies than piss in older men

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:59.840
Yeah, because it's like we all have our little like jokes that we stick to um

01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:06.320
Which is but like also like toilet humor is funny like I'm sorry it kind of is that in slapstick humor

01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:08.320
But we can't exactly do slapstick online

01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:11.680
Um, unless it's like maybe like a 3d thing

01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:15.280
Excuse me

01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:17.280
um and

01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:23.760
But yeah, like we're definitely never gonna beat the pp poo poo corp allegations
