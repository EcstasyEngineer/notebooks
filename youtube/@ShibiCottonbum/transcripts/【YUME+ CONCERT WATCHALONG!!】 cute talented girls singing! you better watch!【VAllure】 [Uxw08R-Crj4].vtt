WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.520
It's weird being in voice chat and not being allowed to spell all the secrets of what I've got planned.

00:05.520 --> 00:07.040
Oh no, it's starting!

00:07.040 --> 00:07.760
It's starting!

00:07.760 --> 00:08.560
It's starting!

00:09.280 --> 00:09.920
Here, here.

00:10.640 --> 00:12.320
Oh, so excited.

00:12.320 --> 00:13.840
Did it just pause? It says three.

00:16.480 --> 00:17.440
Yeah, it's supposed to.

00:19.680 --> 00:20.400
Uh-oh.

00:20.400 --> 00:20.800
Oh no!

00:22.720 --> 00:24.160
Oh, oh, okay.

00:25.360 --> 00:26.000
Oh, wait.

00:26.720 --> 00:29.040
Technical difficulties, it's fine lives, it's fine, Luna.

00:29.120 --> 00:30.160
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

00:34.640 --> 00:36.000
They're so cute, I can't.

00:39.040 --> 00:40.160
Wait, I'm gonna unmute.

00:40.160 --> 00:46.080
I just realized I've not got desktop audio in their split, so I can't hear the streaming you guys can.

00:48.560 --> 00:50.160
How did you guys split the audio?

00:50.160 --> 00:52.160
I've got you guys captured via desktop.

00:53.360 --> 00:56.640
Oh, you have to, you have to make, um, what's it called?

00:57.360 --> 00:58.000
A split.

00:58.640 --> 01:01.360
Yeah, you guys split in OBS so you can do it.

01:01.360 --> 01:02.240
Yeah, that's what I did.

01:02.240 --> 01:03.440
I have two tips.

01:03.440 --> 01:05.680
I have my headset and my IEMs right now.

01:07.440 --> 01:08.640
Oh no.

01:08.640 --> 01:09.440
I hear them.

01:11.920 --> 01:15.200
I've bowled this watch a long time ago, that's all I can say so far.

01:23.120 --> 01:26.960
I'll mute it once they finish their intro.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.960
Oh.

01:41.440 --> 01:42.000
Hello.

01:44.720 --> 01:45.280
Gushy.

01:45.920 --> 01:46.960
Gushy.

01:46.960 --> 01:47.280
Right.

01:47.280 --> 01:47.920
Gushy.

01:48.720 --> 01:49.440
Gishy, Gishy.

01:50.560 --> 01:53.600
I'm like, I got two things she could gush on right here.

01:58.880 --> 02:01.440
Oh, everyone says it's very sweet.

02:01.440 --> 02:02.800
They helped with the watch along.

02:02.800 --> 02:04.480
I know they're helping them with a big concert.

02:05.200 --> 02:05.760
Yeah.

02:05.760 --> 02:08.640
Hey, man, you scratch our back, we scratch yours.

02:08.640 --> 02:10.560
That's how we do it from around these parts.

02:18.560 --> 02:20.000
Mimosa's a good singer.

02:21.040 --> 02:21.360
Yeah.

02:22.320 --> 02:24.240
Dude, Mimosa's so talented.

02:24.240 --> 02:24.800
She is.

02:25.360 --> 02:27.760
I actually got them lungs on her just hiding.

02:27.760 --> 02:29.120
You wouldn't realize.

02:29.120 --> 02:30.560
Don't be fooled by the outfit.

02:30.560 --> 02:31.680
There's lungs under this.

02:31.680 --> 02:32.160
I know.

02:40.640 --> 02:41.760
Damn.

02:55.760 --> 02:57.840
Her model's so bouncy.

02:58.640 --> 02:59.040
It is.

02:59.040 --> 02:59.760
I love that.

03:07.520 --> 03:08.880
I love the way eyelashes.

03:08.880 --> 03:12.320
I know it's not a V-tube or mainstream, but I know.

03:12.320 --> 03:14.080
I was just like strawberries.

03:14.080 --> 03:15.040
I want to eat them.

03:16.400 --> 03:17.920
The flowers in her ears.

03:17.920 --> 03:18.480
I just let's.

03:19.920 --> 03:20.880
It's a different place.

03:20.880 --> 03:21.840
So nice.

03:25.520 --> 03:30.880
Oh, the breadsticks in chat.

03:31.920 --> 03:32.160
Oh.

03:41.920 --> 03:43.120
I like her custom mic.

03:44.720 --> 03:45.600
I didn't even notice.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.440
Oh, it's really cool.

03:48.640 --> 03:50.960
God, I was talking about customized assets today,

03:50.960 --> 03:52.800
and I was like, I never got girls anything.

03:53.760 --> 03:54.160
It was OK.

03:54.960 --> 03:57.920
I was just like, that was, it sounds terrible.

03:57.920 --> 03:59.680
I was like, if I'm not going to use it,

03:59.680 --> 04:01.120
I'm not giving it to them.

04:02.640 --> 04:05.680
Because I showed my end in screen for like the first time

04:05.680 --> 04:08.400
and literally since debut, I showed my end in screen

04:08.400 --> 04:09.360
and everyone was laughing.

04:12.960 --> 04:14.800
Why do you hate the ending screen so much?

04:15.920 --> 04:18.080
I just ends.

04:18.080 --> 04:19.280
She just leaves.

04:19.280 --> 04:20.560
I don't like heart screams.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.400
Literally, if you open up one of my boards,

04:22.480 --> 04:27.520
I'm just like, I don't know.

04:27.520 --> 04:29.120
I literally spent so much money on it.

04:30.320 --> 04:31.440
I just never use the thing.

04:31.440 --> 04:32.800
I've never even seen the stingers.

04:32.800 --> 04:34.320
I never even used stingers on debut.

04:34.320 --> 04:35.680
That's so much I hate them as well.

04:35.680 --> 04:36.880
So I'm showing them the debut.

04:40.320 --> 04:41.680
God, this is fantastic.

04:42.080 --> 04:45.440
This is beyond my expectations.

04:46.400 --> 04:47.840
Mom, this is amazing.

04:47.840 --> 04:50.160
She's like an amazing, amazing singer.

04:50.880 --> 04:52.400
Multi, multi, multi-talented.

04:53.200 --> 04:54.000
Extremely.

04:54.640 --> 04:55.520
Things, streams.

04:58.080 --> 04:59.760
Freaking makes all her own charts as well.

05:00.640 --> 05:01.120
Thumbnails.

05:02.000 --> 05:02.480
You name it.

05:02.480 --> 05:02.960
She does it.

05:03.520 --> 05:04.320
She does them all.

05:04.960 --> 05:06.160
You didn't know she sings.

05:06.800 --> 05:08.880
Well, I'm supposed to keep up with everyone's talents

05:08.880 --> 05:11.200
and the VTuber roster that I'm not aware of.

05:11.200 --> 05:12.320
That's what I thought we'd be from.

05:13.920 --> 05:16.560
You're not constantly stalking when most is channeling me.

05:17.520 --> 05:19.440
Well, that's why I'm supposed to know absolutely everything

05:19.440 --> 05:23.600
about every other VTuber that's been kind enough

05:23.600 --> 05:24.400
to interact with me.

05:24.400 --> 05:24.800
That's right.

05:24.800 --> 05:26.240
You're done for a reason bend over.

05:28.960 --> 05:29.840
Prepare yourself.

05:32.640 --> 05:33.200
What was it?

05:33.200 --> 05:33.680
Tyler.

05:33.680 --> 05:34.240
Hello, everybody.

05:34.240 --> 05:34.880
Hi, Harold.

05:35.600 --> 05:36.800
Something is in my eye.

05:38.320 --> 05:38.800
My eye.

05:41.840 --> 05:43.440
Well, we have a peak refunds.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.960
So I'm surfing the teeth.

05:48.960 --> 05:50.240
Anyone can hear that?

05:50.880 --> 05:51.360
No, I don't.

05:57.520 --> 05:58.000
OK.

05:59.840 --> 06:00.400
Meru!

06:00.640 --> 06:02.080
freak A1 your custom microphone.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.440
Oh, my gosh.

06:14.800 --> 06:15.200
Oh, she's insane.

06:15.200 --> 06:21.200
Oh my god, duet!

06:21.200 --> 06:26.440
Oh my god, how long is this concert?

06:26.440 --> 06:28.640
That is like some built-in and pre-pro-new-

06:28.640 --> 06:32.720
I'm like generally so impressed with the most of his voice in Burroughs.

06:32.720 --> 06:33.720
Me too!

06:33.720 --> 06:35.720
I wish I could speak Japanese!

06:35.720 --> 06:39.720
Imagine us up there.

06:39.720 --> 06:40.720
Konichiwawa.

06:40.720 --> 06:41.720
Konichiwawa.

06:42.720 --> 06:43.720
Konichiwawa.

06:51.720 --> 06:53.720
I forget singing in English.

06:53.720 --> 06:56.720
I can even imagine singing in a different language.

06:56.720 --> 06:57.720
Exactly.

07:00.720 --> 07:04.720
I think we got to get some Japanese speakers for Gen 2, mommy.

07:05.720 --> 07:07.720
We're being influenced live.

07:07.720 --> 07:09.720
You heard it here, folks.

07:11.720 --> 07:14.720
I saw what you tweeted, Chibi.

07:14.720 --> 07:15.720
I don't think I didn't see it.

07:15.720 --> 07:18.720
She went on Twitter and she tweeted a sling girl.

07:18.720 --> 07:20.720
Aw, don't look at me.

07:20.720 --> 07:22.720
I'm not doing nothing.

07:22.720 --> 07:24.720
I freaking saw it.

07:24.720 --> 07:28.720
I'm just slowly just putting it into your mind.

07:28.720 --> 07:34.720
I will get you a Halloween variation outfit of you as a sling girl.

07:34.720 --> 07:35.720
Absolutely.

07:35.720 --> 07:36.720
Yeah?

07:36.720 --> 07:37.720
All yours.

07:37.720 --> 07:40.720
I'm not having an actual sling girl.

07:40.720 --> 07:41.720
All yours.

07:41.720 --> 07:42.720
Yeah!

07:42.720 --> 07:44.720
I'm giving the sling girl!

07:44.720 --> 07:45.720
Yes.

07:45.720 --> 07:46.720
All right.

07:46.720 --> 07:47.720
I'll settle.

07:47.720 --> 07:48.720
I'll settle for that.

07:48.720 --> 07:49.720
I'm the sling girl.

07:49.720 --> 07:50.720
We've defeated the sling allegation.

07:50.720 --> 07:51.720
Yeah!

07:51.720 --> 07:52.720
I'm so...

07:52.720 --> 07:53.720
I'm trying not to scream.

07:53.720 --> 07:56.720
I'm trying to focus on the thing because I'm about to get real giddy.

07:56.720 --> 07:57.720
Things are jiggling on screen.

07:57.720 --> 08:01.720
I don't know if what you guys are looking at, but things are jiggling to me.

08:01.720 --> 08:06.720
Two things are jiggling.

08:06.720 --> 08:14.720
Slime bunny girl, like from Queen's Blade, precisely.

08:14.720 --> 08:17.720
A cotton bum family member is going to be the slime girl.

08:17.720 --> 08:21.720
I'll have to think about that.

08:21.720 --> 08:22.720
Sublime.

08:22.720 --> 08:23.720
She's slimy.

08:23.720 --> 08:24.720
What are you doing?

08:24.720 --> 08:25.720
Shebeth the Slime.

08:25.720 --> 08:26.720
Shebeth the Slime.

08:26.720 --> 08:27.720
Oh my god.

08:27.720 --> 08:29.720
Look at her little freaking...

08:29.720 --> 08:33.720
Look at her little pony tails, Bob.

08:33.720 --> 08:34.720
Yaeli.

08:34.720 --> 08:37.720
Yaeli fish ribbons as well, like the translucent.

08:37.720 --> 08:39.720
Such a good design.

08:39.720 --> 08:42.720
Unfortunately, it's my turn to sing.

08:42.720 --> 08:43.720
Hold on.

08:43.720 --> 08:44.720
Let me get my pen lights out.

08:44.720 --> 08:45.720
No!

08:45.720 --> 08:50.720
No eye moner.

08:50.720 --> 08:52.720
Should we get eye trackers?

08:52.720 --> 08:53.720
I'll do that.

08:53.720 --> 08:58.720
I'll give every girl an eye tracker and we'll watch the most devious videos and stuff.

08:58.720 --> 09:08.720
And then we'll see who's got like 93% pervert rate.

09:08.720 --> 09:09.720
Why is Mamosa so good?

09:09.720 --> 09:18.720
Mamosa, why is Mero so good?

09:18.720 --> 09:22.720
Did they die?

09:22.720 --> 09:25.720
Oh, discord crashed.

09:25.720 --> 09:27.720
Sorry, I died.

09:27.720 --> 09:42.720
I'm asking Mero if she wants to go up on stage because she's watching this.

09:42.720 --> 09:46.720
I think her makes fucking dying.

09:46.720 --> 09:52.720
Yeah, we can't really hear you.

09:52.720 --> 09:56.720
Azura, are you alive?

09:56.720 --> 09:57.720
I'm fine.

09:57.720 --> 09:58.720
I'm fine.

09:58.720 --> 09:59.720
I'll take that.

09:59.720 --> 10:00.720
She's so excited.

10:00.720 --> 10:02.720
She's so, so excited to get on stage.

10:02.720 --> 10:03.720
She just ran away.

10:03.720 --> 10:08.720
She's like at the thought, at the concert.

10:08.720 --> 10:11.720
Let me get two pen lights out.

10:11.720 --> 10:12.720
I don't have different colors.

10:12.720 --> 10:13.720
I only have blue.

10:13.720 --> 10:17.720
I have so many questions for them about how long this took.

10:17.720 --> 10:18.720
This is insane.

10:18.720 --> 10:19.720
I know.

10:20.720 --> 10:27.720
They should just like take the soundtracks here and just post them as song covers too.

10:27.720 --> 10:28.720
Honestly, that's a smart idea.

10:28.720 --> 10:29.720
I think they should.

10:29.720 --> 10:31.720
I think they will.

10:31.720 --> 10:32.720
You think they will?

10:32.720 --> 10:33.720
I hope so.

10:33.720 --> 10:34.720
Because it's really good.

10:34.720 --> 10:36.720
They shouldn't just leave it here on the stream.

10:36.720 --> 10:40.720
I want full song covers.

10:40.720 --> 10:43.720
Let us hear your lungs.

10:43.720 --> 10:46.720
This tiny jellyfish got lungs on her too.

10:46.720 --> 10:48.720
God dang.

10:48.720 --> 11:00.720
Azura is singing along to it.

11:00.720 --> 11:03.720
I think that's why she's muted.

11:03.720 --> 11:04.720
Damn.

11:04.720 --> 11:14.720
That's where you're not beating the weave allegations.

11:14.720 --> 11:19.720
This concert is epic.

11:19.720 --> 11:20.720
Literally.

11:20.720 --> 11:22.720
I had no idea what to expect.

11:22.720 --> 11:25.720
I've never actually sat through it.

11:25.720 --> 11:33.720
This is so cool.

11:33.720 --> 11:36.720
Uncle, give us another mate.

11:36.720 --> 11:39.720
I don't know why this creature is dying for me.

11:39.720 --> 11:41.720
It's hard to know.

11:41.720 --> 11:43.720
I'm just so surprised at the stage.

11:43.720 --> 11:48.720
All the assets.

11:48.720 --> 11:52.720
The light show.

11:52.720 --> 11:53.720
It's really pretty.

11:53.720 --> 11:55.720
Mara is so cute.

11:55.720 --> 12:01.720
She is.

12:01.720 --> 12:04.720
This is so cool.

12:04.720 --> 12:07.720
She has her tentacles bounce.

12:07.720 --> 12:10.720
Is Azura's mute at the audio?

12:10.720 --> 12:12.720
She's going to get coffee.

12:12.720 --> 12:17.720
I mean.

12:17.720 --> 12:23.720
The reminder not to play the audio of the stream.

12:23.720 --> 12:25.720
On stream.

12:25.720 --> 12:30.720
Question of those headlights being held up by my arms.

12:30.720 --> 12:40.720
Oh, this goes hard.

12:40.720 --> 12:47.720
Got a different vibe.

12:47.720 --> 12:52.720
If I'm he started singing in Japanese, I would have absolutely lost my mind.

12:52.720 --> 12:56.720
Wait, is she about to?

12:56.720 --> 13:02.720
I think this is an English cover.

13:02.720 --> 13:05.720
If you guys had to sing a song for a concert, what would you sing?

13:05.720 --> 13:06.720
That's my question.

13:06.720 --> 13:11.720
I would rap something ridiculous.

13:11.720 --> 13:25.720
ABC's.

13:25.720 --> 13:34.720
Sing five bars, five seconds.

13:34.720 --> 13:37.720
Two in your mom live edition.

13:37.720 --> 13:43.720
Why does this court keep shitting the bed?

13:43.720 --> 13:46.720
Lincoln Park calling you.

13:46.720 --> 13:48.720
There you go.

13:48.720 --> 13:50.720
I streamed a fish.

13:50.720 --> 13:52.720
I probably do American.

13:52.720 --> 14:04.720
I like green.

14:04.720 --> 14:05.720
Okay.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.720
I may go off.

14:07.720 --> 14:08.720
Hit him.

14:08.720 --> 14:09.720
Hit him.

14:09.720 --> 14:10.720
Hit him.

14:10.720 --> 14:11.720
Hit him.

14:11.720 --> 14:13.720
Hey, don't hurt him now.

14:13.720 --> 14:17.720
Kill him.

14:17.720 --> 14:30.720
That's so cool.

14:30.720 --> 14:38.720
Oh, no, she's hot.

14:38.720 --> 14:47.720
I just set the ambiance.

14:47.720 --> 14:48.720
Feel that music.

14:48.720 --> 14:56.720
Feel them tunes.

14:56.720 --> 14:57.720
I saw it.

14:57.720 --> 14:58.720
I saw it.

14:58.720 --> 14:59.720
Execute me.

14:59.720 --> 15:00.720
I me.

15:00.720 --> 15:06.720
I don't know if you guys have ever played Alice Madness Returns, but when you get low health,

15:06.720 --> 15:12.720
you enter a state of hysteria and you unlock a different version like to your look.

15:12.720 --> 15:17.720
And this I me is like completely making me want to play Alice Madness Returns right now.

15:17.720 --> 15:18.720
That's a great game.

15:18.720 --> 15:19.720
I've heard of that game.

15:19.720 --> 15:21.720
I want to play it too.

15:21.720 --> 15:22.720
Oh, I recommend.

15:22.720 --> 15:23.720
I me darkness way.

15:23.720 --> 15:24.720
Yeah.

15:24.720 --> 15:26.720
I me darkness dementia way.

15:26.720 --> 15:28.720
Just like my immortal.

15:28.720 --> 15:31.720
I love her mic too.

15:31.720 --> 15:33.720
All the song choices are really good too.

15:33.720 --> 15:35.720
They're all catchy.

15:35.720 --> 15:45.720
I'm in.

15:45.720 --> 15:55.720
Oh, shit.

15:55.720 --> 16:01.720
Execution.

16:01.720 --> 16:12.720
I'm too more to add them to the rest.

16:12.720 --> 16:13.720
Three.

16:13.720 --> 16:14.720
Whoa.

16:14.720 --> 16:17.720
They're all singing together.

16:17.720 --> 16:20.720
Are there songs that support this?

16:20.720 --> 16:22.720
What is it?

16:22.720 --> 16:25.720
Oh, wait.

16:25.720 --> 16:27.720
This is crazy.

16:27.720 --> 16:44.720
It's not just like one solo song or do it.

16:44.720 --> 16:49.720
Let's go.

16:49.720 --> 16:54.720
Oh my gosh.

16:54.720 --> 16:55.720
Okay.

16:56.720 --> 17:11.720
Oh my gosh.

17:11.720 --> 17:13.720
YouTube does need anime emotes.

17:13.720 --> 17:16.720
Someone's using a pickle instead of the baguettes.

17:16.720 --> 17:28.720
Put your pickle away.

17:28.720 --> 17:32.720
I love Amara bounces her little tentacle ponytails.

17:32.720 --> 17:40.720
Yay.

17:40.720 --> 17:44.720
I must have taken so much work to practice.

17:44.720 --> 17:47.720
I have so many questions for them after this.

17:47.720 --> 17:49.720
Like, holy crap.

17:49.720 --> 17:50.720
I'm sorry.

17:50.720 --> 17:52.720
I'm not singing in Japanese.

17:52.720 --> 17:54.720
No, I'm not going to ask you to.

17:54.720 --> 17:55.720
Holy crap.

17:55.720 --> 17:58.720
I would never ask you to sing in another language.

17:58.720 --> 18:02.720
Japanese fans would hate me because I would just butcher everything.

18:02.720 --> 18:04.720
Because I would not be able to.

18:04.720 --> 18:06.720
This is so beautiful and amazing.

18:06.720 --> 18:08.720
I'm sorry, but.

18:08.720 --> 18:10.720
I should have said sorry.

18:10.720 --> 18:18.720
I'll do Megan the stallion song.

18:18.720 --> 18:21.720
What does she want?

18:21.720 --> 18:27.720
I didn't hear that new one from Megan the stallion.

18:27.720 --> 18:30.720
I forgot the name of the faking song.

18:30.720 --> 18:32.720
I already forgot the name of the song too.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.720
I was listening to it this morning.

18:34.720 --> 18:37.720
It's your time up.

18:37.720 --> 18:40.720
I need some Japanese songs to sing.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.720
Japanese?

18:42.720 --> 18:46.720
That's okay.

18:46.720 --> 18:51.720
I'll sing that part of it.

18:51.720 --> 18:53.720
What's up?

18:53.720 --> 18:55.720
It happens by own words.

18:55.720 --> 18:58.720
And the birds and the eagles.

18:58.720 --> 19:00.720
I will sing that version.

19:00.720 --> 19:10.720
Some of the uptails on it that aren't real words.

19:10.720 --> 19:13.720
I just want to smush her little face.

19:13.720 --> 19:18.720
She gives me cute aggression.

19:18.720 --> 19:21.720
I have seen the Japanese version of Doja Cat say so.

19:21.720 --> 19:23.720
It is very good.

19:23.720 --> 19:27.720
It's very cute.

19:27.720 --> 19:30.720
I'm making the Scottish version and getting a million views.

19:30.720 --> 19:33.720
You should.

19:33.720 --> 19:37.720
In the moment, I want to say so.

19:37.720 --> 19:40.720
I love this song.

19:40.720 --> 19:43.720
I just got shivers.

19:43.720 --> 19:46.720
Her voice is so clear.

19:46.720 --> 20:01.720
I'm getting shivers from her singing.

20:01.720 --> 20:04.720
If you guys want to do song collabs,

20:04.720 --> 20:07.720
I can set the other VTubers for you.

20:07.720 --> 20:12.720
That would be fun.

20:12.720 --> 20:15.720
I love this song.

20:15.720 --> 20:18.720
Do you want to sing magnet with me?

20:18.720 --> 20:21.720
Vocaloid magnet?

20:21.720 --> 20:24.720
I don't know what that is.

20:24.720 --> 20:27.720
Am I aging myself right now?

20:27.720 --> 20:30.720
No.

20:30.720 --> 20:32.720
Let me look it up.

20:32.720 --> 20:35.720
Maybe I'm forgetting the name.

20:35.720 --> 20:37.720
Miku.

20:37.720 --> 20:40.720
And forbidden lovers.

20:40.720 --> 20:42.720
I've never heard this one.

20:42.720 --> 20:44.720
No.

20:44.720 --> 20:46.720
You've never heard magnet?

20:46.720 --> 20:49.720
No.

20:49.720 --> 20:52.720
It's from Chibi Collab.

20:52.720 --> 20:55.720
Jason.

20:55.720 --> 20:58.720
Do you want to do magnet with me?

20:58.720 --> 21:01.720
You're asking the wrong one.

21:01.720 --> 21:05.720
You were singing a

21:05.720 --> 21:08.720
Ed Sheeran's thing of the whole bit.

21:08.720 --> 21:11.720
My voice is so broken.

21:11.720 --> 21:14.720
We have mixers.

21:14.720 --> 21:17.720
We'll do a recorded concert.

21:17.720 --> 21:20.720
I'm just a me.

21:20.720 --> 21:23.720
You did not even sound like that.

21:23.720 --> 21:26.720
Come off it.

21:26.720 --> 21:29.720
Come off it now.

21:29.720 --> 21:32.720
There you use these

21:32.720 --> 21:35.720
terminologies again.

21:35.720 --> 21:38.720
I'll make a comment.

21:38.720 --> 21:41.720
I'll be very interested to see

21:41.720 --> 21:44.720
how your accent would develop.

21:44.720 --> 21:47.720
Chibi had never done it before until

21:47.720 --> 21:50.720
debut.

21:50.720 --> 21:53.720
Then we did the debut mock and she goes

21:53.720 --> 21:56.720
Arise.

21:56.720 --> 21:59.720
Where did this come from?

21:59.720 --> 22:02.720
I was studying.

22:02.720 --> 22:11.720
I was, I was, uh, holding my inner Scott since I'm Scottish myself and my mom's side and my mom's side.

22:11.720 --> 22:16.720
Oh, you're more hen. I probably can or then.

22:16.720 --> 22:21.720
I didn't. Yeah, my great-grandmother immigrated from Scotland. I didn't even know that.

22:21.720 --> 22:25.720
That's so cool. I'm here for it.

22:25.720 --> 22:31.720
Oh, she got her love eyes on. She got her love eyes on.

22:31.720 --> 22:36.720
Hell yeah. Go little joke. Go little joke. Go little joke. Go.

22:36.720 --> 22:41.720
My jokes.

22:41.720 --> 22:43.720
The song is really good.

22:43.720 --> 22:49.720
Maybe like the song.

22:49.720 --> 22:54.720
Is this where I see it in me that her song's being mixed right now?

22:54.720 --> 22:57.720
Oh, it's, that's Fortnite Battle Pass.

22:57.720 --> 23:00.720
You're doing Fortnite Battle Pass as a,

23:00.720 --> 23:04.720
I don't even know what to tell them what the plan was.

23:04.720 --> 23:06.720
Go ahead.

23:06.720 --> 23:11.720
So I really like Amy's voice and I wanted her to make a meme song cover.

23:11.720 --> 23:18.720
And the one song I really wanted her to cover is the song that's Fortnite Metal Pass.

23:18.720 --> 23:29.720
That'll go viral. I'll tell you that right now. This is my prediction.

23:29.720 --> 23:36.720
She was alive while she was away on holiday, but unfortunately we were having a lot of delay issues just everywhere.

23:36.720 --> 23:43.720
But she drew her own artwork for it. I'm getting it animated and then it's been turned into a little cute video,

23:43.720 --> 23:46.720
but it's less than a minute long, so I'm going to get it into...

23:46.720 --> 23:47.720
They're together!

23:47.720 --> 23:48.720
Sorry.

23:48.720 --> 23:53.720
Because she cut herself off.

23:53.720 --> 23:56.720
Yeah, Rhea!

23:56.720 --> 24:00.720
We stan Vocaloid. Shadow Wizard Money Gang.

24:00.720 --> 24:02.720
We love Vocaloid.

24:02.720 --> 24:08.720
Oh my God, Rain's voice is so mummy.

24:08.720 --> 24:11.720
I love that Rain has like a slight valley accent.

24:11.720 --> 24:12.720
Does she?

24:12.720 --> 24:13.720
Yeah.

24:13.720 --> 24:16.720
I didn't notice.

24:16.720 --> 24:18.720
It's very, very slight.

24:18.720 --> 24:20.720
It fits her model so well though.

24:20.720 --> 24:21.720
It does.

24:21.720 --> 24:23.720
I actually just wanted to really...

24:23.720 --> 24:24.720
Did these were jumping?

24:24.720 --> 24:26.720
Sorry, I'm a child. I'm an absolute child.

24:26.720 --> 24:27.720
Forgive me.

24:27.720 --> 24:31.720
Forgive me.

24:31.720 --> 24:34.720
Veiler Fortnite skins? Absolutely not.

24:34.720 --> 24:35.720
Could you imagine?

24:35.720 --> 24:43.720
It was like cash money flow emo on someone after you kill them and it's just Emmys fans.

24:43.720 --> 24:50.720
She's in her jays like dancing over the cars with someone because she got first place.

24:50.720 --> 24:53.720
Oh my God.

24:53.720 --> 24:57.720
Oh, I would do an Arata Shigako song.

24:57.720 --> 25:01.720
I really like Tokyo Calling because it's about...

25:01.720 --> 25:03.720
You're going to say Tokyo Drift.

25:03.720 --> 25:10.720
No, no, no. It's called Tokyo Calling and it's about how dystopian your life can become

25:10.720 --> 25:15.720
if you don't kind of find the meaning of it or that's what I took away from it and it's like...

25:15.720 --> 25:18.720
One of the lines that really resonates me is like...

25:18.720 --> 25:21.720
They're singing magnet? Are they?

25:21.720 --> 25:22.720
Shut up.

25:22.720 --> 25:24.720
I'm going to lose it.

25:24.720 --> 25:29.720
They are singing magnet. Oh my God, I'm literally going to cry.

25:29.720 --> 25:32.720
This is one of my favorite Vocaloid songs.

25:32.720 --> 25:34.720
Oh my God, actually.

25:34.720 --> 25:37.720
I'm geeking out. I'm geeking.

25:37.720 --> 25:39.720
Riefland's almost... I was actually...

25:39.720 --> 25:45.720
Hatsune Miku was my entrance into the anime world to say the things. I said what I said.

25:45.720 --> 25:48.720
Are they going to do the Japanese or the English version?

25:48.720 --> 25:50.720
That's my question.

25:50.720 --> 25:51.720
The world?

25:51.720 --> 25:53.720
Oh, they're doing the Japanese.

26:03.720 --> 26:08.720
Duuu duuu duuu duuu duuu duuu duu duuu duuu duuu duuu duuu duaa duuu duuu duuu duuu duuu duuu hello.

26:08.720 --> 26:09.720
Creaming your jarts.

26:09.720 --> 26:11.720
They were creamed long ago. Thank you.

26:11.720 --> 26:13.720
Reia's voice.

26:18.720 --> 26:21.720
I love Reia's singing voice. Oh my God.

26:21.720 --> 26:23.720
She sounds so like...

26:23.720 --> 26:26.720
It's a little bit more mature. It's so clear and smooth.

26:26.720 --> 26:28.720
I think almost ethereal. You know that?

26:28.720 --> 26:31.720
Yeah, absolutely. Every time she opens, she sings, it gives me servers.

26:31.720 --> 26:51.200
servers. Oh, this takes me back.

27:01.720 --> 27:23.200
I'm so happy right now. I like

27:23.200 --> 27:24.560
Rains Mike. Mom, can we get

27:24.560 --> 27:28.560
mics? Okay, get makes. Actually,

27:29.200 --> 27:30.480
this is insider knowledge. You

27:30.480 --> 27:31.320
guys aren't supposed to know

27:31.320 --> 27:33.320
this, but you can't keep a secret

27:33.320 --> 27:34.600
for the life of you. I started

27:34.600 --> 27:38.000
it. I was like, oh, everyone

27:38.000 --> 27:38.960
else can know that's listening

27:38.960 --> 27:40.400
into a I haven't met any of the

27:40.400 --> 27:41.800
girls in August and they can

27:42.320 --> 27:44.000
have we are going to discuss

27:44.000 --> 27:48.240
alternative outfits. Well, I

27:48.240 --> 27:49.320
already know I'm getting slime.

27:50.480 --> 27:51.520
Well, that's for Halloween. But

27:51.520 --> 27:53.800
like Halloween. Oh, shit. I'm

27:53.800 --> 27:55.200
under way. Oh, God. Well, you

27:55.200 --> 27:56.320
just said we're gonna be for

27:56.320 --> 27:57.480
Halloween. She forgot what she

27:57.480 --> 28:00.400
said. If we're doing Halloween

28:00.400 --> 28:02.720
costumes, I'm gonna need to fill

28:02.720 --> 28:05.560
some string. If you guys want

28:05.560 --> 28:07.760
Halloween costumes, you must

28:07.760 --> 28:09.680
tell me in the meeting. I want

28:09.680 --> 28:11.560
to be a slamber for Halloween.

28:15.280 --> 28:16.600
I don't know what I'm going to

28:16.600 --> 28:20.360
do for my alternate outfit. I saw

28:20.360 --> 28:23.280
you do that. I think I'm going

28:23.280 --> 28:27.200
to save the idea for 2.0.

28:28.080 --> 28:31.240
Please remember when if you guys

28:31.240 --> 28:32.360
would like to sign on for the

28:32.360 --> 28:34.080
next year, we also offer a free

28:34.080 --> 28:36.360
alternate outfit on the house.

28:36.360 --> 28:38.680
So if you have one idea you like,

28:38.680 --> 28:40.520
but it's not what you go for, we

28:40.520 --> 28:42.720
can probably cover it later.

28:43.240 --> 28:47.040
Thanks, Trani. Again, inside

28:47.040 --> 28:50.200
your knowledge. If you work

28:50.200 --> 28:51.600
under Vealer and sign on for

28:51.600 --> 28:53.040
the next year, your split goes

28:53.040 --> 28:54.840
up and further 5% in your

28:54.840 --> 28:57.200
favor. Oh my gosh.

29:02.040 --> 29:04.120
Aren't I just pulling them

29:04.120 --> 29:04.760
strings?

29:07.280 --> 29:09.360
My ever self sacrificing

29:09.440 --> 29:13.440
mother. She's shilling.

29:20.400 --> 29:22.120
What do you mean? You don't like

29:22.120 --> 29:23.840
the way that we rain cloud?

29:25.840 --> 29:27.360
Making kills while watching a

29:27.360 --> 29:28.040
concert.

29:31.920 --> 29:33.160
Oh, strongy.

29:34.640 --> 29:36.320
Make sure she gets so excited.

29:36.400 --> 29:36.920
That's why.

29:38.240 --> 29:39.840
Bro, I literally leak everything.

29:39.840 --> 29:40.840
I like all of this place.

29:40.840 --> 29:44.480
I don't know because A.C. is

29:44.480 --> 29:45.640
going to be in the meeting about

29:45.640 --> 29:46.840
all of this unfolding.

29:46.840 --> 29:48.280
So when's that meeting supposed

29:48.280 --> 29:48.640
to be?

29:49.880 --> 29:52.080
I'll I don't know August 1st.

29:52.640 --> 29:55.120
August 1st. I'll just put that

29:55.120 --> 29:56.680
down, pencil. Someday.

30:03.880 --> 30:04.960
What's the August, September,

30:04.960 --> 30:08.880
October? No, I want to.

30:11.440 --> 30:12.640
Maybe it was just like short

30:12.640 --> 30:15.960
notice. Or maybe she wasn't

30:15.960 --> 30:18.560
feeling good. It's a lot.

30:18.560 --> 30:19.600
It's a lot of practice.

30:20.360 --> 30:22.920
Stress. It is stressful as

30:22.920 --> 30:25.240
well. Yeah. Yeah, get all that

30:25.240 --> 30:26.080
stuff done.

30:32.080 --> 30:33.720
Look at I.B. just bow bobbing

30:33.720 --> 30:34.680
up and down. She's like, yep,

30:34.680 --> 30:35.840
yep, yep, yep, I'm ready.

30:37.480 --> 30:39.120
Of her jacket came comes up

30:39.120 --> 30:39.760
with her.

30:41.600 --> 30:42.920
And she bubbles.

30:45.880 --> 30:48.320
Oh, I love them.

30:48.960 --> 30:50.000
Sorry, I'm a wee sump.

30:53.920 --> 30:55.400
Yeah, we love we stand Kingdom

30:55.400 --> 30:56.360
Hearts in this home.

30:58.440 --> 30:59.440
This Kingdom Hearts good. I

30:59.440 --> 31:00.240
never had the opportunity.

31:00.240 --> 31:01.840
I thought the plan for October

31:01.840 --> 31:03.040
was giggle sticks.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.840
No, no, no, I had.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.120
Oh, my God, the script master

31:09.120 --> 31:10.840
got an absolute bolligan and I

31:10.840 --> 31:12.280
got a refund on some stuff.

31:12.400 --> 31:13.920
Yeah, as you should.

31:13.920 --> 31:15.520
I will I'm going to rewrite it

31:15.520 --> 31:16.880
myself. I'm not even going to

31:17.120 --> 31:18.240
hide you.

31:18.240 --> 31:20.360
Well, apparently he might have

31:20.360 --> 31:21.320
already rewrote it.

31:21.320 --> 31:23.120
I've not looked at it, but I

31:23.120 --> 31:25.400
am. I'm I will I'm going to

31:25.400 --> 31:26.400
take a peek right now.

31:26.840 --> 31:28.040
Yeah, take a peek.

31:29.120 --> 31:30.840
He replaced giggle sticks with

31:30.840 --> 31:32.040
a light stick.

31:33.280 --> 31:35.000
Oh, could you imagine?

31:35.520 --> 31:36.840
OK, I stopped meeting in the

31:36.840 --> 31:38.760
script now and it's just like

31:38.960 --> 31:40.480
fucking substitutes instead.

31:42.160 --> 31:43.600
Just rate clock.

31:43.600 --> 31:44.520
What?

31:44.520 --> 31:45.280
It's going on.

31:45.320 --> 31:46.920
Patriot, it's fine.

31:47.720 --> 31:50.720
Honestly, the fucking

31:51.400 --> 31:52.960
the disc stick on us.

31:53.960 --> 31:55.200
Nuzzle Fudge.

31:57.400 --> 31:58.720
Awful.

31:58.720 --> 32:00.240
OK, literally just took out all

32:00.240 --> 32:01.160
of the direction.

32:02.240 --> 32:05.280
Oh, is the actual script usable?

32:06.400 --> 32:07.880
He left in cock-suckery.

32:10.080 --> 32:11.200
Cock-suckery.

32:11.200 --> 32:12.960
I mean, if you can overlook that

32:12.960 --> 32:14.640
as a script usable question,

32:14.640 --> 32:15.520
Mark, we're not going to have to

32:15.520 --> 32:17.960
go in and I honestly

32:17.960 --> 32:19.120
have been I have a bad taste in

32:19.120 --> 32:19.960
my mouth, although I'll talk

32:19.960 --> 32:20.400
about this later.

32:20.400 --> 32:21.120
We'll talk about this later.

32:21.120 --> 32:22.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:22.120 --> 32:23.160
Concert, concert, concert.

32:23.160 --> 32:23.960
You know, business, business,

32:23.960 --> 32:25.840
business, business, business, business.

32:26.480 --> 32:28.120
This is a great song, too.

32:29.480 --> 32:31.200
My light stick burns brighter than

32:31.200 --> 32:32.200
ever.

32:34.200 --> 32:35.560
I got my light sticks here.

32:37.400 --> 32:38.400
Go off by me.

32:40.360 --> 32:41.880
Don't forget to check out the link

32:41.880 --> 32:43.800
in the description, guys, because

32:43.800 --> 32:45.480
I've got all their links on YouTube.

32:45.480 --> 32:47.320
Like, they have worked so hard on

32:47.320 --> 32:49.360
this concert, even a cheeky song.

32:49.360 --> 32:51.240
And I like on the stream right now.

32:51.240 --> 32:52.760
I pinned it in my chat.

32:52.760 --> 32:54.320
Just give it a cheeky, like, let

32:54.320 --> 32:55.560
them know that I fucking enjoyed

32:55.560 --> 32:56.480
this because this is.

32:58.400 --> 32:59.680
Like, I know you could argue, oh,

32:59.680 --> 33:00.880
they're only singing a three minute

33:00.880 --> 33:03.520
song. No, behind the scenes.

33:03.520 --> 33:04.720
Are you kidding me?

33:04.720 --> 33:05.560
There's so much.

33:05.560 --> 33:06.560
So much stuff.

33:07.840 --> 33:09.680
All while they were streaming as

33:09.680 --> 33:11.160
well in the background, they would

33:11.160 --> 33:13.000
have had to have been streaming and

33:13.000 --> 33:14.600
then, like, do vocal practice, do

33:14.600 --> 33:16.600
warm-up practice songs, record, get

33:16.600 --> 33:19.080
it sent to a mixer, edits, or, like,

33:19.080 --> 33:21.400
just be good to them, OK?

33:21.400 --> 33:22.800
Be good to be nice.

33:22.800 --> 33:24.280
Bambigets, yes.

33:24.280 --> 33:25.800
Welcome to Bambigets in the chat.

33:26.480 --> 33:27.840
Let them know the reflins showed up.

33:27.840 --> 33:29.080
I heard the song in such a long

33:29.080 --> 33:30.080
time.

33:30.440 --> 33:31.440
I hear them.

33:31.440 --> 33:32.440
Shut up.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.560
That's months of presence.

33:35.560 --> 33:36.800
You can see all the reflins in the

33:36.800 --> 33:37.800
chat forgetting.

33:37.800 --> 33:38.800
Good reflins.

33:38.800 --> 33:40.120
I see you well.

33:40.120 --> 33:41.600
That's what I like to see.

33:41.640 --> 33:42.920
You all get rewarded.

33:45.640 --> 33:47.760
Yeah, make sure to click on the link

33:47.760 --> 33:49.160
in my chat. Give them a give them a

33:49.160 --> 33:50.160
like.

33:50.160 --> 33:51.320
So up to their channels, up to the

33:51.320 --> 33:52.840
girls. I have very stuff in my

33:52.840 --> 33:54.000
description and all the other girls

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
do too. So.

33:56.240 --> 33:57.240
Is Mercy in here?

33:57.240 --> 33:58.240
Is she?

33:58.240 --> 33:59.520
No, Mercy's not here.

33:59.520 --> 34:00.520
Mercy's by her lone son.

34:00.520 --> 34:01.520
OK.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.480
She said she would yap too much

34:03.480 --> 34:04.480
also.

34:04.480 --> 34:05.720
Yeah, because she's like, I'm going

34:05.720 --> 34:07.160
to be real. I'm going to be mad

34:07.160 --> 34:08.160
annoying.

34:09.840 --> 34:11.320
She's probably like also geeking

34:11.360 --> 34:12.360
out right now.

34:12.360 --> 34:13.640
It's probably it's like yapping a

34:13.640 --> 34:14.640
bunch.

34:15.960 --> 34:17.200
My sweet Mercy.

34:31.360 --> 34:32.440
I was going to pretend that rain

34:32.440 --> 34:33.640
was like just tearing up on the

34:33.640 --> 34:34.640
guitar.

34:35.640 --> 34:37.640
Yeah, I'm going to do it.

34:40.640 --> 34:41.400
Shrondi, can you play the

34:41.400 --> 34:42.400
instruments?

34:43.960 --> 34:45.360
No, I never learned.

34:45.360 --> 34:46.360
I was athletic.

34:47.800 --> 34:50.320
Oh, what kind of athletics?

34:50.320 --> 34:52.200
And I was called

34:52.200 --> 34:54.080
athletics and swimming as well.

34:54.080 --> 34:56.840
And I'm I running

34:56.840 --> 34:58.400
like athletics and the hurdle

34:58.400 --> 35:00.000
athletics and anything that has

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
to do with their grippers.

35:03.120 --> 35:04.400
I'm not being the grippers.

35:04.840 --> 35:06.240
Someone commented on my feet.

35:06.240 --> 35:07.480
They were like, you have very long

35:07.480 --> 35:08.600
toes. And I'm like, sorry, you

35:08.600 --> 35:10.360
stuffed your toes so much that

35:10.360 --> 35:11.920
they're like fucking nubs.

35:11.920 --> 35:13.440
But I used me.

35:13.720 --> 35:15.560
I have regular toes.

35:15.880 --> 35:16.960
If you didn't know, you're supposed

35:16.960 --> 35:18.400
to be able to walk on them, not like

35:18.400 --> 35:20.560
a little stubbly fucking way.

35:20.880 --> 35:21.880
Like fucking toes.

35:22.440 --> 35:24.120
And she took that personally.

35:27.320 --> 35:28.320
Honestly.

35:30.160 --> 35:31.880
But I'm saying my toes are long.

35:31.880 --> 35:32.720
My toes are normal.

35:32.760 --> 35:33.760
All together.

35:37.320 --> 35:39.320
Harmony is the melody of the heart.

35:43.960 --> 35:44.760
I can't stop sharing it.

35:44.760 --> 35:45.760
Reigns boobs.

35:46.640 --> 35:48.040
It's when she bounces, we bounce

35:48.040 --> 35:50.640
so like lately, they're like

35:50.640 --> 35:51.640
in and out.

35:59.880 --> 36:02.200
Oh, my God, that's another trio.

36:02.240 --> 36:03.240
That's so impressive.

36:04.160 --> 36:06.040
It's so impressive.

36:07.080 --> 36:08.240
It's got the lungs for this.

36:08.240 --> 36:10.600
I'm I'm tired just thinking

36:10.600 --> 36:12.240
and can say I know what I'm saying.

36:12.360 --> 36:13.360
I mean.

36:17.320 --> 36:18.160
Oh, don't hurt them.

36:18.160 --> 36:19.160
No, don't hurt them.

36:22.840 --> 36:24.240
I also have long toes.

36:25.560 --> 36:26.560
Nothing wrong.

36:27.400 --> 36:29.000
You can really grip it with those

36:29.000 --> 36:30.160
long toes. Yeah.

36:31.160 --> 36:32.160
Grip what?

36:33.560 --> 36:34.560
It.

36:37.640 --> 36:39.080
Group songs are much harder to mix

36:39.080 --> 36:40.080
together, too.

36:42.400 --> 36:44.200
I mean, I feel like it's not hard

36:44.200 --> 36:45.480
to mix anything when it comes to

36:45.480 --> 36:46.480
these girls because they just

36:46.480 --> 36:47.680
naturally sound perfectly.

36:47.680 --> 36:48.680
Oh, yeah.

36:48.680 --> 36:50.280
They're speaking voices, they're

36:50.280 --> 36:51.480
singing voices.

36:52.120 --> 36:53.120
Yeah.

36:55.440 --> 36:56.960
Stoney can clap real good.

36:56.960 --> 36:58.280
Oh, we flint.

37:01.120 --> 37:02.560
Grip in the grippy stick with my

37:02.560 --> 37:03.560
grippers.

37:05.680 --> 37:06.680
OK, no.

37:14.200 --> 37:15.880
I want that as a tramp stamp on

37:15.880 --> 37:16.880
my model. Thank you.

37:16.880 --> 37:18.880
Nuzlin, the fast, fast one.

37:18.880 --> 37:20.880
That's with my grippers.

37:30.160 --> 37:31.160
I don't know.

37:49.040 --> 37:50.480
I wonder what mic she uses,

37:50.480 --> 37:52.640
Raya, because her stuff is so

37:52.640 --> 37:53.640
clear.

37:53.840 --> 37:54.840
I know.

37:55.280 --> 37:56.480
Oh, thank you for the gift,

37:56.480 --> 37:57.480
it boy.

38:00.840 --> 38:01.840
Who that boy?

38:02.320 --> 38:03.320
Who him is?

38:03.400 --> 38:04.760
I'm not OK, Tyler.

38:04.760 --> 38:05.760
Go off.

38:06.080 --> 38:07.080
No.

38:08.080 --> 38:09.880
I'm too pasty to see that song.

38:20.520 --> 38:21.720
Are you enjoying it, Zara?

38:21.720 --> 38:23.520
I just heard our giggle.

38:23.520 --> 38:24.520
I tell you.

38:31.160 --> 38:32.160
Oh, my God.

38:32.160 --> 38:33.160
This is fantastic.

38:36.160 --> 38:37.160
Imagine this in 3D.

38:38.160 --> 38:40.160
Oh, that would be so good.

38:41.160 --> 38:43.160
I would be pissing myself.

38:43.160 --> 38:44.160
Same.

38:46.160 --> 38:47.160
I didn't know how 3D concerts

38:47.160 --> 38:48.160
work.

38:49.160 --> 38:50.160
I didn't know you were going to

38:50.160 --> 38:51.160
ask me for a Mariah about that.

38:51.160 --> 38:52.160
Yeah.

38:53.160 --> 38:54.160
He didn't say their knowledge.

38:54.160 --> 38:55.160
Come on, lad.

38:55.160 --> 38:56.160
Come on, Reflin's pill or bring

38:56.160 --> 38:57.160
one, bring one, bring one, bring

38:57.160 --> 38:58.160
one, bring one.

38:58.160 --> 38:59.160
Come on, Reflin's pill or bring

38:59.160 --> 39:00.160
one, bring one, bring one.

39:00.160 --> 39:01.160
Go do the work.

39:01.160 --> 39:02.160
Go on, Reflin's.

39:02.160 --> 39:03.160
Go on.

39:04.160 --> 39:05.160
There was this company that

39:05.160 --> 39:06.160
helped Uteno Pandora

39:09.160 --> 39:10.160
to do her 3D concert

39:11.160 --> 39:12.160
and it's an upcoming company.

39:12.160 --> 39:13.160
And I was like, ooh.

39:14.160 --> 39:15.160
Oh, my God.

39:15.160 --> 39:16.160
Inside her knowledge, too,

39:16.160 --> 39:18.160
I met Uteno Pandora before

39:18.160 --> 39:20.160
she debuted and before I debuted.

39:21.160 --> 39:22.160
That's so cool.

39:22.160 --> 39:23.160
Yeah, it's so cool.

39:23.160 --> 39:24.160
I mean, she doesn't know that.

39:24.160 --> 39:26.160
She doesn't know that we met

39:26.160 --> 39:28.160
before, but I know that we met

39:28.160 --> 39:29.160
before.

39:30.160 --> 39:31.160
Oh, my God.

39:31.160 --> 39:32.160
That's cool, though.

39:33.160 --> 39:34.160
She was so nice to me.

39:35.160 --> 39:36.160
She's so lovely, but I don't

39:37.160 --> 39:38.160
interact with her anymore

39:39.160 --> 39:40.160
because she doesn't know who I

39:40.160 --> 39:41.160
am. Smile.

39:42.160 --> 39:43.160
Smile.

39:44.160 --> 39:45.160
She's so, so lovely.

39:46.160 --> 39:47.160
Grin.

39:47.160 --> 39:48.160
Yeah.

39:48.160 --> 39:49.160
And her goal was to have a 3D

39:49.160 --> 39:50.160
concert and she achieved it.

39:51.160 --> 39:52.160
Oh, she achieved it.

39:52.160 --> 39:53.160
That's so sweet.

39:53.160 --> 39:54.160
I love girlies

39:55.160 --> 39:56.160
in their dreams.

39:56.160 --> 39:57.160
Achieved.

39:59.160 --> 40:00.160
Achieved those goals.

40:01.160 --> 40:02.160
You're only holding yourself back.

40:11.160 --> 40:13.160
This is a good ray of bobble.

40:16.160 --> 40:17.160
I love seeing how they move

40:17.160 --> 40:18.160
their models.

40:21.160 --> 40:22.160
I wonder if...

40:23.160 --> 40:24.160
What?

40:29.160 --> 40:30.160
It's not ogre yet, is it?

40:32.160 --> 40:33.160
No, I'm core.

40:33.160 --> 40:34.160
Come on, get back on the stage.

40:34.160 --> 40:35.160
God damn.

40:35.160 --> 40:36.160
We didn't finish it.

40:37.160 --> 40:38.160
Oh, an idol song.

40:39.160 --> 40:40.160
We're mollans

40:40.160 --> 40:41.160
and aimless

40:42.160 --> 40:43.160
in song together.

40:44.160 --> 40:45.160
Is that a...

40:45.160 --> 40:46.160
Is that a Zora?

40:47.160 --> 40:48.160
Is that a Zora?

40:49.160 --> 40:50.160
Yeah!

40:51.160 --> 40:52.160
Are you enjoying it?

40:54.160 --> 40:55.160
Are you having fun as Zora?

40:56.160 --> 40:57.160
Yeah!

41:12.160 --> 41:14.160
I didn't realise how reactive

41:14.160 --> 41:16.160
Mimosa's ears are.

41:16.160 --> 41:17.160
Yeah.

41:17.160 --> 41:18.160
They are.

41:18.160 --> 41:19.160
They're all well-read.

41:20.160 --> 41:21.160
Mmm.

41:22.160 --> 41:23.160
And her boobs, too.

41:23.160 --> 41:24.160
I know, I can't stop sharing

41:24.160 --> 41:25.160
everyone's boobs.

41:28.160 --> 41:30.160
I have really bad eyes, though.

41:30.160 --> 41:32.160
So sometimes Mimosa's arms

41:32.160 --> 41:33.160
look like a part of her hair.

41:33.160 --> 41:34.160
And she's a little nuggy.

41:35.160 --> 41:36.160
Is she like a little nuggy?

41:37.160 --> 41:38.160
You know what I love it.

41:41.160 --> 41:42.160
Her arms are very thin,

41:42.160 --> 41:43.160
so they tend to kind of

41:43.160 --> 41:45.160
disappear into her hair, for sure.

41:46.160 --> 41:48.160
She's our little nugget.

41:49.160 --> 41:50.160
My little nugget.

41:50.160 --> 41:51.160
I want chicken nuggets.

41:54.160 --> 41:55.160
Oh my god, I had really good

41:55.160 --> 41:56.160
chicken nuggets yesterday.

41:56.160 --> 41:57.160
I know this is completely off-dolting,

41:58.160 --> 41:59.160
but it's fucking delicious.

41:59.160 --> 42:00.160
I was like,

42:01.160 --> 42:02.160
I have bad eyes.

42:03.160 --> 42:04.160
This is not an excuse to stare at boobs.

42:05.160 --> 42:06.160
Let me alone.

42:09.160 --> 42:11.160
Oh, get it, get it, get it, get it.

42:11.160 --> 42:12.160
This is so hate.

42:12.160 --> 42:13.160
Hate.

42:35.160 --> 42:36.160
Yeah, Mimosa's voice.

42:36.160 --> 42:37.160
Mimosa's voice.

42:41.160 --> 42:42.160
Her mouth tracking is really good.

42:49.160 --> 42:50.160
Nothing wrong with wanting

42:50.160 --> 42:51.160
some strawberry milk.

42:51.160 --> 42:52.160
Get out of here.

43:06.160 --> 43:18.160
My question is,

43:18.160 --> 43:20.160
are they doing a five-man song

43:20.160 --> 43:21.160
at the end?

43:21.160 --> 43:22.160
I bet.

43:22.160 --> 43:23.160
I hope so.

43:23.160 --> 43:24.160
I hope they do.

43:24.160 --> 43:25.160
Yeah.

43:25.160 --> 43:26.160
I wonder if they'll do

43:26.160 --> 43:27.160
like an original song.

43:28.160 --> 43:29.160
Yeah.

43:29.160 --> 43:30.160
That would be crazy.

43:31.160 --> 43:33.160
We should do an original song.

43:33.160 --> 43:34.160
Yeah, why did we learn

43:34.160 --> 43:35.160
not to do an original song?

43:35.160 --> 43:36.160
I'm like, bro, it's stressful,

43:36.160 --> 43:37.160
and I was trying to debut.

43:37.160 --> 43:38.160
Last thing I'm going to do

43:38.160 --> 43:39.160
is give them a custom song

43:39.160 --> 43:41.160
that they like to try and do.

43:41.160 --> 43:43.160
We should all have an original,

43:43.160 --> 43:44.160
we should have a group song

43:44.160 --> 43:45.160
that's an original.

43:45.160 --> 43:46.160
Okay.

43:46.160 --> 43:47.160
I'll do the male part of the song

43:47.160 --> 43:48.160
because my voice can handle that.

43:48.160 --> 43:50.160
I'll do the rap part of the song.

43:53.160 --> 43:55.160
I'll do the backup vocals.

43:56.160 --> 43:58.160
That leaves Azura and Mercy

43:58.160 --> 43:59.160
and Icy.

43:59.160 --> 44:00.160
Perfect.

44:00.160 --> 44:01.160
We're good.

44:01.160 --> 44:02.160
Yeah, they can carry us

44:02.160 --> 44:03.160
through the actual vocals.

44:03.160 --> 44:04.160
Exactly.

44:05.160 --> 44:06.160
I'll just do that.

44:06.160 --> 44:07.160
Yeah.

44:08.160 --> 44:10.160
Who's Adler of everything?

44:11.160 --> 44:12.160
I'm scared of you.

44:12.160 --> 44:13.160
Be lower.

44:19.160 --> 44:20.160
I'm mommy right now,

44:20.160 --> 44:21.160
taking notes, honestly.

44:21.160 --> 44:23.160
Bro, I'm spamming their DMs.

44:23.160 --> 44:24.160
I'm like, how long did that

44:24.160 --> 44:25.160
fucking take?

44:25.160 --> 44:26.160
You're supposed to take it.

44:28.160 --> 44:29.160
Maybe even months, honestly.

44:29.160 --> 44:30.160
Maybe this has been

44:30.160 --> 44:31.160
cooking since day one.

44:31.160 --> 44:32.160
You never know.

44:32.160 --> 44:33.160
I know I want to ask

44:33.160 --> 44:34.160
the girls after.

44:36.160 --> 44:37.160
I want to eat

44:38.160 --> 44:39.160
the strawberries on her head.

44:40.160 --> 44:41.160
I want to eat her.

44:42.160 --> 44:43.160
Shame.

44:43.160 --> 44:44.160
Look at the little saucy wink

44:44.160 --> 44:45.160
she ended on.

44:45.160 --> 44:46.160
She was like...

44:48.160 --> 44:49.160
She knows what she's doing.

44:50.160 --> 44:51.160
She knows it.

44:51.160 --> 44:52.160
Not to make you guys jealous,

44:52.160 --> 44:53.160
but...

44:57.160 --> 44:58.160
Please.

44:59.160 --> 45:00.160
Please, five-man song.

45:01.160 --> 45:02.160
Come on.

45:05.160 --> 45:06.160
Come on.

45:15.160 --> 45:16.160
Moving on.

45:17.160 --> 45:18.160
I know, I just got scared.

45:18.160 --> 45:19.160
I'm like, what's happening?

45:23.160 --> 45:24.160
I feel out.

45:24.160 --> 45:25.160
Okay.

45:33.160 --> 45:34.160
Oh, my God, I mean...

45:37.160 --> 45:38.160
Really big.

45:50.160 --> 45:51.160
I'm ready.

45:51.160 --> 45:53.160
Oh, it's a five-man.

45:55.160 --> 45:56.160
Let's go.

45:59.160 --> 46:00.160
That's amazing.

46:01.160 --> 46:02.160
What song is this?

46:03.160 --> 46:04.160
Original?

46:04.160 --> 46:05.160
Is this a K-pop song?

46:06.160 --> 46:07.160
Is it K-pop?

46:08.160 --> 46:09.160
Yeah.

46:11.160 --> 46:12.160
What song is this?

46:13.160 --> 46:14.160
I'm wondering...

46:15.160 --> 46:16.160
It makes sense that they picked

46:16.160 --> 46:17.160
a K-pop group.

46:17.160 --> 46:18.160
Yeah, that's true.

46:18.160 --> 46:19.160
Because they all have

46:19.160 --> 46:20.160
girl singers with different parts.

46:20.160 --> 46:21.160
It's a Twice song.

46:21.160 --> 46:22.160
It is a Twice song.

46:24.160 --> 46:26.160
I feel like I would recognize it

46:26.160 --> 46:27.160
if it was a Twice song,

46:27.160 --> 46:28.160
but I guess I'm a fake Twice fan.

46:32.160 --> 46:34.160
Name this particular member's

46:34.160 --> 46:36.160
grandmother's maiden name right now.

46:45.160 --> 46:46.160
Oh, I'm getting tingles.

46:46.160 --> 46:47.160
This is awesome.

46:48.160 --> 46:49.160
Oh, my God.

46:51.160 --> 46:53.160
Can someone tell me what song this is?

46:54.160 --> 46:56.160
It's K-D-A, apparently.

46:56.160 --> 46:58.160
Okay, that makes more sense.

46:59.160 --> 47:00.160
Oh, it's K-D-A?

47:01.160 --> 47:02.160
Yeah.

47:02.160 --> 47:03.160
Why did somebody say it was Twice?

47:03.160 --> 47:04.160
Why are you lying?

47:05.160 --> 47:07.160
Oh, it's I'll Show You by K-D-A and Twice.

47:07.160 --> 47:08.160
Okay.

47:12.160 --> 47:14.160
Song for League of Legends.

47:14.160 --> 47:16.160
Oh, well, that's Azura fucking Happy.

47:17.160 --> 47:18.160
She's probably geeking out right now.

47:18.160 --> 47:19.160
Hold on.

47:19.160 --> 47:20.160
I want to go to her stream.

47:21.160 --> 47:22.160
I'm going to.

47:22.160 --> 47:24.160
She's going to be singing all the words from that one.

47:26.160 --> 47:28.160
We'll listen to Azura singing, too.

47:28.160 --> 47:29.160
Yeah.

47:31.160 --> 47:33.160
She's probably harmonizing with them.

47:38.160 --> 47:40.160
We popped up.

47:45.160 --> 47:46.160
Oh, she's not singing.

47:46.160 --> 47:48.160
Sing for me, Azura.

47:48.160 --> 47:49.160
Sing.

47:53.160 --> 47:54.160
She's just bopping.

47:55.160 --> 47:57.160
She's bopping from her fear right now.

47:58.160 --> 48:00.160
I'm going to say sing.

48:05.160 --> 48:07.160
I do, like, K-D-A songs.

48:13.160 --> 48:15.160
Wow, almost his voice.

48:18.160 --> 48:21.160
I wish I could sing like that, my God.

48:22.160 --> 48:25.160
I wish I could sing in Korean and in Japanese.

48:29.160 --> 48:30.160
That sounds so good.

48:30.160 --> 48:32.160
This is such a great song for all of them.

48:37.160 --> 48:40.160
This must have been a lot of practice, my God.

48:46.160 --> 48:48.160
I like how Azura is just like in the corner.

48:53.160 --> 48:54.160
Is that chair?

48:54.160 --> 48:55.160
I'm leaning hard.

49:02.160 --> 49:03.160
Her voice.

49:04.160 --> 49:05.160
I love Azura.

49:09.160 --> 49:10.160
No, encore!

49:10.160 --> 49:11.160
Give us more!

49:11.160 --> 49:13.160
Mom, I want more!

49:13.160 --> 49:14.160
I want more!

49:18.160 --> 49:19.160
No.

49:20.160 --> 49:21.160
It cannot be.

49:21.160 --> 49:22.160
Encore.

49:22.160 --> 49:24.160
Do the DJ scratch.

49:24.160 --> 49:26.160
Be like, oh, last song.

49:26.160 --> 49:27.160
We don't have time.

49:27.160 --> 49:28.160
And then DJ scratch.

49:28.160 --> 49:30.160
And they're all like, let's go!

49:32.160 --> 49:33.160
After party.

49:34.160 --> 49:35.160
Yeah.

49:35.160 --> 49:36.160
After party!

49:41.160 --> 49:42.160
On Reia's channel?

49:42.160 --> 49:43.160
Yeah.

49:43.160 --> 49:44.160
I'm going to go to Reia's channel right now.

49:45.160 --> 49:46.160
Azura!

49:50.160 --> 49:51.160
Azura!

49:52.160 --> 49:53.160
Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit.

49:53.160 --> 49:54.160
Wait.

49:54.160 --> 49:55.160
Hold on.

49:57.160 --> 49:58.160
That was really good.

49:59.160 --> 50:01.160
Party, party, party, party, party!

50:01.160 --> 50:03.160
That was insane.

50:03.160 --> 50:04.160
Yeah, dang.

50:04.160 --> 50:05.160
Let's see.

50:05.160 --> 50:06.160
Arm.

50:07.160 --> 50:09.160
Give me one second.

50:09.160 --> 50:10.160
Never more.

50:11.160 --> 50:13.160
I'm going to see if we can either watch it.

50:13.160 --> 50:16.160
If not, I will redirect into her.

50:16.160 --> 50:18.160
I'm going to redirect into her.

50:19.160 --> 50:22.160
How do you redirect without ending stream?

50:22.160 --> 50:24.160
You're not in the stream.

50:24.160 --> 50:25.160
Yeah, you're not in the stream.

50:25.160 --> 50:26.160
You should edit.

50:26.160 --> 50:27.160
Edit video.

50:28.160 --> 50:29.160
Edit video?

50:29.160 --> 50:30.160
Yeah.

50:30.160 --> 50:34.160
Yeah, you edit video or you just go into studio, YouTube studio.

50:34.160 --> 50:35.160
Yeah, but how do you send them?

50:35.160 --> 50:40.160
How do you send your viewers to the stream without ending your own stream?

50:40.160 --> 50:42.160
Oh, I thought I didn't know what you were asking.

50:42.160 --> 50:43.160
Oh, no, I don't know.

50:43.160 --> 50:44.160
You can do that.

50:44.160 --> 50:47.160
You could just post a link and be like, go forth.

50:50.160 --> 50:53.160
In fact, I'm pulling up the link right now.

50:54.160 --> 50:58.160
I'll post a link and then I'm going to chat with everyone for a little bit and then I'm going to redirect.

50:58.160 --> 51:00.160
Okay, I'll do that too.

51:01.160 --> 51:02.160
I'm going to see you guys.

51:02.160 --> 51:03.160
Okay.

51:04.160 --> 51:05.160
Bye.

51:09.160 --> 51:10.160
What is it?

51:10.160 --> 51:11.160
1115.

51:11.160 --> 51:12.160
Oh, she's not pulled up yet.

51:12.160 --> 51:13.160
That's why she's not live.

51:14.160 --> 51:15.160
There you go.

51:18.160 --> 51:21.160
I'm doing remedy for the poor post-concert crisis.

51:21.160 --> 51:26.160
Okay, I will redirect into the waiting room for them briefings.

51:26.160 --> 51:28.160
I'm going to say thank you to Amy.

51:28.160 --> 51:30.160
She'd be keeping me company during this.

51:30.160 --> 51:31.160
Absolutely.

51:31.160 --> 51:32.160
Likewise.

51:32.160 --> 51:33.160
Thank you.

51:33.160 --> 51:35.160
Thank you so much.

51:38.160 --> 51:39.160
I nailed it.

51:39.160 --> 51:41.160
And business, business, business.

51:42.160 --> 51:43.160
I didn't mean to spam their discord.

51:43.160 --> 51:45.160
I was supposed to do it live once too.

51:45.160 --> 51:47.160
Thank you so much, girls.

51:47.160 --> 51:48.160
I'll talk to you later, all right?

51:48.160 --> 51:49.160
Bye.

51:49.160 --> 51:50.160
Okay.

51:50.160 --> 51:51.160
Bye.

51:51.160 --> 51:52.160
Bye.

51:55.160 --> 51:56.160
All right, guys.

51:56.160 --> 51:57.160
That was fun.

51:57.160 --> 51:58.160
That was great.

51:58.160 --> 51:59.160
My God, that was awesome.

52:00.160 --> 52:01.160
It is such a good job.

52:02.160 --> 52:04.160
I'm so impressed with their singing skill.

52:04.160 --> 52:08.160
I didn't know that, like, a lot of them had pipes like that.

52:09.160 --> 52:12.160
And for such a small company to be able to, like,

52:12.160 --> 52:13.160
make something that amazing,

52:13.160 --> 52:15.160
you could see why Stradi was geeking out.

52:15.160 --> 52:19.160
She's feeling very inspired because they did such an amazing job.

52:19.160 --> 52:20.160
And they're so talented.

52:20.160 --> 52:23.160
You, my plus girls are so talented and they're so sweet.

52:23.160 --> 52:25.160
I love spending time with you, my plus girls.

52:25.160 --> 52:26.160
They're literally awesome.

52:28.160 --> 52:30.160
But yeah, head on over to Reyes channel,

52:30.160 --> 52:33.160
the sweet little jote, unfortunately,

52:33.160 --> 52:35.160
right at the end.

52:35.160 --> 52:39.160
I don't know what will consist of the after-party.

52:39.160 --> 52:45.160
It seems like it'll be in 20 minutes.

52:47.160 --> 52:48.160
Looks like everybody's redirecting.

52:48.160 --> 52:52.160
Looks like Rocky from Pixeling's also redirecting.

52:52.160 --> 52:53.160
Okay, yeah.

52:53.160 --> 52:55.160
I think everybody's kind of redirecting into them.

52:55.160 --> 52:57.160
So I'll see you guys later.

52:58.160 --> 53:01.160
Make sure you go check out the watch, the after-party.

53:03.160 --> 53:06.160
So, yeah, I'll probably be in the chat and geeking out with them.

53:06.160 --> 53:09.160
So, bye guys. Love you.

53:09.160 --> 53:12.160

53:12.160 --> 53:17.160

54:27.160 --> 54:29.160
Bye.

54:57.160 --> 55:04.160
I forgot you guys can hear me.

55:04.160 --> 55:07.160

55:07.160 --> 55:09.160

55:11.160 --> 55:14.160
Oh, you can almost hear me.

55:14.160 --> 55:17.160
Oh, I'm a ghost.

55:17.160 --> 55:19.160
It's like you can hear me.

55:19.160 --> 55:21.160
