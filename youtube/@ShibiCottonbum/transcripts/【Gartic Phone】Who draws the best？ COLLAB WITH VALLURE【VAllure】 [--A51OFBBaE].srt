1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Say anything bad because I'm lying

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Okay, okay, okay

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm lying

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Did my stream

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Is it going up or still working?

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I don't know

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Still?

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Okay

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Yeah, it takes like a hot second for me to even appear like when I guys guys guys

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It killed my broadcast room

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You want?

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You killed your broadcast room right now like it suddenly like stop streaming and then my my power wash simulator

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Okay, I replay deleted

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm live right now so don't say anything

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm live right now

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
This is a nightmare

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Chat, we're so sorry

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Oh god

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We're so professional

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's been awful

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Reflects you don't know

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
How many of them were...

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Merci, will I make you a new room?

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yay

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Hold on

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Okay

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'll go make myself some tea while we're here

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
No

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Hey, look at that, look at that

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Wait, what are you doing?

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
No, you're a li-

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Okay, you can go make some tea

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We'll keep-

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
No, we'll just-

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You've got this stream

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I don't know how to make some tea

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You can go make tea, that's fine

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
We need to help Merci

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Yeah, stream up

40
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Guys, we have been at this for 26 minutes

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
We were on power washer for one hour

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And every time we went past four of the girls connecting

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The connection started timing out for some reason

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
But if for some reason in power washer

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
If you haven't played the entire campaign

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It doesn't allow you to have six persons in your lobby

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And I'm the only one with a finished save file

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And it was too late to ship all the code information

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
To send it on your stream

50
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So, basically, Shibi was like

51
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'll set this one out, you guys just do it

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And we're like, no, we can't do it

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The whole point of this is that we're all together in this

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So then we're like, right, who's got Gmod, right?

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I don't have it, right?

56
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Who's got RAF, right?

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I don't have it, right?

58
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Who's got this game?

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I don't have it

60
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I was trying my best

61
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Shibi was like going through the list

62
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
She was flicking them pages like next page, next page, next page

63
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Jackbox, okay, that won't work

64
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Gartik, okay, sure

65
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
All right, we'll do Jackbox

66
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And then, wait, that requires us to screen record discord

67
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm like, we can't have that

68
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
We see outrageous things in the discord

69
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
We don't even have a HR department, so we can't share

70
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So then Gartik Phone, which I've never played before

71
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
is coming in clutch right now

72
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Amy's currently making a cup of tea

73
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Mercy is just getting a room set up for her

74
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
because she accidentally nuked her vod of the collab stream

75
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It was an hour split

76
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
This couldn't have gone any worse

77
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I think that's pretty on character for us

78
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Yeah, if someone can insert that meme and put all of her hairs on it

79
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
and be like, aren't v-tubers cute when they're almost...

80
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
That's all I'm gonna say

81
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Well, you guys can finish the sentence after that

82
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I can?

83
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
No, I'm kidding

84
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
No, no, you're not like that

85
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The refunds, the snowberries, the billion hearts

86
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The harem, I remember

87
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I was like, okay, I'm gonna be honest

88
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
When the harem told me they were called harem

89
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I read it as harem, and I was like, that makes no sense

90
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
for Shibi's character design

91
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I do too, I do too

92
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I was like, what?

93
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I have a harem of so many people

94
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
that are my little, you know, playthings and clients

95
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
and they're my harem, and that's hair

96
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
which is a rabbit

97
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
but it's not a rabbit, hair and rabbit are different

98
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
but you know what I mean

99
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's a good pun

100
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's a pun, exactly

101
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And they're also called harlots

102
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The individuals are harlots, or harlots

103
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Wait, hold on

104
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I thought you said hairless

105
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Wait, let me...

106
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
They're hairless

107
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Some of them aren't, I can tell you that

108
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Do you still have that thumbnail, Mercy?

109
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Are we good now?

110
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I got a tooth

111
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Almost, almost to me

112
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Mercy, if you still have that thumbnail

113
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
if you just throw up the stream

114
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Is she gonna throw up on stream?

115
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Stream is what you're screaming

116
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Yeah, it should default to that

117
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
If you just change to the thumbnail and pick our take

118
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm chilling, telling herself to stream

119
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
What are you screaming?

120
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm dying, I cannot right now

121
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Oh, my goodness gracious

122
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Yeah, how's the volume?

123
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Yeah, it's my volume, okay

124
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Can you hear everyone else?

125
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Miro

126
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Who said the harlots are waxed in my chat?

127
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
The harlots are waxed

128
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I need them to be clean and proper

129
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I see it, I see it, hold on

130
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Okay, that's good

131
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
How do I change the garlic phone?

132
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
On Manage Broadcast on OBS

133
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And it was not doing so bad

134
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Oh, they called, we have the column

135
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Pichinko, thank you for the 10 members

136
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
My 10 gifted

137
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Don't gift right now

138
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
This is awful

139
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Any gifters?

140
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Any gifters?

141
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
At 2 o'clock

142
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yeah, any gifters for my non-monetized channel?

143
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Oh, no!

144
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
How can this happen to me?

145
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I was muted the entire time!

146
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I can hear you

147
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
We heard you

148
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
No, what is happening?

149
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Right, mercy

150
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
What is this?

151
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
This is awful

152
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
This is a fever dream, guys

153
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
This isn't real

154
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
We're all in beds

155
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I guess I should change my stuff now

156
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Why do we need to change?

157
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
No, you don't have to change anything

158
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
As long as the game is on stream, you can change it after stream

159
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
No one gives a shit when the stream is called

160
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
As long as we're online right now

161
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm just doing it because there's like

162
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm sitting here

163
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
The girls are running around

164
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Like everything's on fire

165
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And I'm like, it'll be fine

166
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
We're good

167
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
We're gonna play some Gartik phone

168
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
We're gonna have a great time

169
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
They think the world is gonna end

170
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Don't forget to like and subscribe on this stream

171
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
If you're enjoying your experience as a viewer

172
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Smash that bell to get notifications of when we go live

173
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Smash that bell to get smashed

174
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Oh, I see

175
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Yeah, like with alcohol or something

176
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Yeah

177
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Not literally

178
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I can't help myself

179
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
She loves smashing

180
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Like Nigel Thornberry

181
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
She just says smashing

182
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
And that's it, you know

183
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
She just loves, I see love smashing

184
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Are we here?

185
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
No

186
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm barely here right now

187
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Okay, finally

188
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
We're here

189
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm sorry for the mess

190
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
We're good

191
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Yeah, we're here

192
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
She's talking to her chat

193
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
We, a viewer, have done the holistic approach

194
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Where none of us will mute

195
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So

196
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You're just gonna hear everything

197
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
All at once

198
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
That's all

199
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
We're all

200
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It just is a remainder

201
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
All donations, my memberships

202
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Or super chats will be addressed

203
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
At the end of the stream

204
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
When it's not an absolute cluster

205
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Buck of all six of us together

206
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
But yes

207
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
The whole premise of the Power Washer

208
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Was I was gonna do a gag and be like

209
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Oh, Viola isn't doing so well

210
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
We might go bust

211
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So everyone put a bikini on

212
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
And get cleanin'

213
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Well, that idea is out the window now

214
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So instead we're playing Gartik Phone

215
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I've never played it personally

216
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
She be

217
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Suggested it and I

218
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Her word is LOL

219
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
So let's just take it away

220
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I am taking over the company

221
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I am the shadow CEO

222
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yes

223
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Okay, do you guys want to start?

224
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You ready?

225
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

226
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Woo!

227
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Let's do it, let's do it

228
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Three, two, one

229
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
We can finally do it

230
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Let's go!

231
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I know cheating

232
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
The guy is so chat

233
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Don't fucking cheat

234
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Don't fucking do it

235
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I swear it out, beat your ass

236
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Shhh

237
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I don't know

238
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
How long do I have to do the sentence?

239
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I don't know

240
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Help me out, help me out

241
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Reflings don't give out way until it's over

242
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
This is our secret

243
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Oh wait

244
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
How many

245
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
How many

246
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Wait, I don't think they'll know what that is

247
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
So let me change it

248
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Hello?

249
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Hello?

250
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Oh we don't have any time

251
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
What's wrong?

252
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
What the

253
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Alright

254
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
We have to draw these now

255
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
We have to draw these now

256
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Oh my god.

257
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Oh my god.

258
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm driving with a...

259
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
After the mouse.

260
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You broke the...

261
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I can't see.

262
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Don't cheat.

263
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
This is so bad.

264
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Oh no.

265
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Oh.

266
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I've never done this before.

267
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Wait, can I make my pain smaller?

268
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Is she...

269
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Oh no.

270
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Why is he getting drunk?

271
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Why am I drunk?

272
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I don't even know what's happening.

273
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Why are you guys screaming?

274
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Oh my god.

275
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Holy fuck.

276
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
How much time is left in my god?

277
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
The top right corner is the indicator.

278
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Not the sharing.

279
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm an artist.

280
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Wait, what is this?

281
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I brought my drawing tablet out.

282
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
An artist.

283
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Oh my god.

284
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm an artist.

285
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Oh yeah, wait.

286
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
All you can fucking draw about me.

287
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You're all done.

288
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I have to look up at the logo.

289
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
We need to witness them.

290
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Hold on.

291
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
What the fuck am I doing?

292
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
What is this?

293
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
What the fuck am I doing?

294
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I should whip out my drawing tablet for this.

295
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Actually, it's better with a mouse.

296
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It's better with a mouse.

297
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
How much time?

298
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
No, it's better with a mouse if it looks like...

299
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It looks great.

300
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
This looks like a fucking...

301
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Okay, the top.

302
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
He's just gonna do something else.

303
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'm done.

304
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm done.

305
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
What does text say?

306
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I can't tell you.

307
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
These are items.

308
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
That's all I'm saying.

309
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
100% wood.

310
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Why not?

311
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
These are the chat logs.

312
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
We need to put the chat logs in quick.

313
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
These are the chat logs.

314
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Good answer.

315
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You guys aren't ready for mine?

316
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Let's put that in detail.

317
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
We need some wood detail.

318
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Americans always look in detail.

319
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
What is this?

320
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
What the fuck?

321
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Oh shit, what's the name?

322
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
There we go.

323
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
There you go.

324
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
What do you think?

325
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Tilly! Tilly!

326
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
My gen mates are wild!

327
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I don't know what he looks like.

328
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Look at this Google picture.

329
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
God.

330
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
She be sent so far away.

331
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I'm away from my wife.

332
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Oh right.

333
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I don't know what Thornberry looks like.

334
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Oh no.

335
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I had to look it up.

336
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm just guessing.

337
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm just going for it.

338
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
What do I look like?

339
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I look like this.

340
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I don't look like that.

341
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Sugar.

342
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Don't question.

343
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And then I got my planters.

344
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Bunches.

345
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Walk it.

346
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
That's me.

347
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
That's the story I've ever made.

348
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
How do you draw?

349
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I don't know.

350
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I don't know.

351
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Perfect.

352
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I don't know how to draw.

353
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I don't know how to draw anymore.

354
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
That's pretty good right?

355
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I think I agree.

356
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
They agree with me.

357
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I don't know.

358
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Hold on.

359
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I need to add some.

360
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Ginger in it.

361
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
There you go.

362
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
That's me.

363
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I don't know what.

364
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
That adds some hair.

365
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
What?

366
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
This is awful.

367
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I'm sorry.

368
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
This is...

369
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I don't know.

370
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Let's draw some hair.

371
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Oh my god.

372
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Yeah.

373
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Oh my goodness.

374
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Draw his thorn.

375
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
His nose.

376
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Just google a picture.

377
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Don't do that.

378
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I still ate the thorn run.

379
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
That is very nice.

380
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Thank you.

381
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
My little reeflings are saying I'm a true artist.

382
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Wait, wait. No.

383
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Emi's hair is not orange.

384
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Emi's ginger.

385
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I'm ginger?

386
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
You thought you were blonde?

387
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Your hair is orange.

388
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I thought I was blonde.

389
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
No.

390
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
What the fuck am I looking at?

391
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'm sorry.

392
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
That's my image.

393
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
What does that even say?

394
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
My wash.

395
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Me-i-ow.

396
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Oh, meow.

397
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Oh my god.

398
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Meow.

399
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Which one of you speaks Spanish?

400
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
That's French.

401
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
That's French.

402
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Oh lord.

403
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
What?

404
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Oh, how am I supposed to draw that?

405
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Jesus Christ.

406
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Did we even have...

407
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
What do I look like?

408
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Oh wait, I can't even draw the fucking toilet.

409
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Alright, hold on.

410
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
What do I even look like?

411
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
This is terrible.

412
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I'm out.

413
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
This is so hard with the mouth.

414
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Wait, this is not feet.

415
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
This is armpits.

416
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
We're like, we're grabbing onto the ground for dear life in this one.

417
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Right, armpits.

418
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
So...

419
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I don't know.

420
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I like throwing in words that they don't know.

421
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Because none of you guys know like some English phrases.

422
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Or some like jokie phrases.

423
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
So I can already...

424
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
What I'm hearing is that a lot of you guys are misinterpreting what I've written.

425
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And it's very funny.

426
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
It's going all over his back.

427
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
It's not looking good.

428
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
How do you draw an angry mouth?

429
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Oh, there we go.

430
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
And then...

431
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Armpits!

432
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
We need to draw...

433
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
This is amazing.

434
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
What does the Walmart logo mean?

435
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Your armpits has become sentience.

436
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Walmart.

437
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I'm not even going to explain to Mercy.

438
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I'm not even going to...

439
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Oh wait, don't your toilets have like...

440
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Oh wait!

441
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I don't know what's wrong with him.

442
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I don't know.

443
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
It just makes it better.

444
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It makes it worse.

445
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
It makes it worse.

446
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Oh my god.

447
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Oh my...

448
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Uh...

449
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
He's just like...

450
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
This is too fucking funny.

451
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Perfect.

452
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I think that works out.

453
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
There we go.

454
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
The radiation.

455
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I can't wait to see everyone.

456
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
All according to plan.

457
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Now we'll get to see everything.

458
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I'll do manual.

459
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
There's going to be no voiceover.

460
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
And then we'll do beginning from the end.

461
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Okay.

462
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
So...

463
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
So I said,

464
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I see with Nigel Thornberry's face

465
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
saying smashing.

466
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I mean...

467
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
And Mercy too.

468
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I'm very old.

469
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Smash weak.

470
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I'm strong.

471
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I'm strong.

472
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Oh my god!

473
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I love it.

474
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Why does she look like...

475
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Oh my gosh, she looked like that!

476
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Okay, Imi, go ahead.

477
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Oh no.

478
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Oh boy.

479
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You're honest, you wanted it.

480
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
And then there's Chris Hansen.

481
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
And I said, oh, she said it's going to jail for the crime scene on date.

482
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Oh no!

483
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Oh shit, I'm going to jail.

484
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Oh my god!

485
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Oh my god, full circle!

486
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I love it, I love it!

487
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
That actually worked out.

488
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Why does your OG Santa such a fat cock?

489
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Jesus fuck.

490
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Because he loves me and he's dead gross sick.

491
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
It grew six times that day.

492
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
All right.

493
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Sestrani's.

494
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I'm sorry.

495
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Oh my god.

496
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Merse, it's cheesy, fester and fat.

497
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I feel like her feet is actual cheese.

498
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I know.

499
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Hey, I like that pull.

500
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:52,000
And I wrote stinky peats, which is his feet, but little slang.

501
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,000
And then she drew pits.

502
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Oh my god, that's too good.

503
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Is she cutting out?

504
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
She's screaming so loud.

505
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Azura.

506
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Azura!

507
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I see, very good artist.

508
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I got it from fucking AC.

509
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Thank you.

510
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
What does that even mean?

511
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
When your job is a poo, so when your poo hits your prostate on the way out.

512
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Oh, a job is a poo?

513
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
What is this?

514
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Is he me sucking?

515
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Have you suckered on them hot too?

516
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Oh wait, has she given a blowjob?

517
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
That's what it looks like.

518
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
That's what it looks like to me.

519
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Oh my god.

520
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Oh my god.

521
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
The drill.

522
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
The drill is so good.

523
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Oh boy.

524
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Over some pie.

525
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Oh my god, that's pretty good.

526
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
That's cute, I love that.

527
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
That's a really cute toy.

528
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
How is that a cat?

529
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
How is that a cat?

530
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Meow.

531
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Meow winky face guys, come on.

532
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Okay, it's a winky face.

533
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I was like, what is meow us?

534
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I was like, who is this Spanish?

535
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Niko with.

536
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
We are so good.

537
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
That's good, that's good.

538
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I love that.

539
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Okay, this makes sense.

540
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
This makes sense of what on earth we were drawing.

541
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
See, that's the checkout and like that's items on the shelves.

542
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I worked really hard.

543
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Oh my god.

544
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Oh this is a good diaper.

545
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I see understood me.

546
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Why is he praying?

547
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Oh my god, praying for the den full.

548
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I love the details.

549
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Taking a mind to shots.

550
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Honestly.

551
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Why is it coming out of his back?

552
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
It was good everywhere.

553
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
It's like on his back.

554
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Yeah, I can't.

555
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Toilet stall gap.

556
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Because that's all I see about when I like see American memes.

557
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
They're like, oh the toilet stall.

558
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
The toilet gap is so big.

559
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
You can literally look at people's eyes through it.

560
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Do you guys want to play a different version?

561
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Oh no, we have them closed because you know it's a private time

562
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
and you're very vulnerable taking a big job.

563
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
So yeah, it's actually closed everywhere else in the planet.

564
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Oh you're so lucky.

565
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I had people peeking at me in high school through the stalls

566
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
and I'm like, can I help you?

567
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Me too.

568
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Oh no, is there a DC?

569
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Is there a check?

570
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Is there a DC check?

571
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Are you in the lobby? Do you need to reload the lobby?

572
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
It's gonna do it on its own usually.

573
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
No, I'm gone.

574
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
The link should be in the discord.

575
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Don't show your fucking screen on the discord.

576
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
They'll see everything.

577
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
They'll see all of our naughty photos we just sent to each other.

578
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
It's mostly memes.

579
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Any memers?

580
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I mean, to be fair, we did share...

581
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
We did share some ugly memes.

582
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
We did share some smoky nudes of ours.

583
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
They've seen my titties.

584
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I started roleplaying as the girls with my nudes.

585
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I was like, this is what Evie would do.

586
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
This is what Acey would do.

587
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Discord is so chaotic.

588
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Okay, real though.

589
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
But also, I did snort out my tea.

590
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
It like went down the wrong hole and went out my nose.

591
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Wow, Marcy out here snorting tea.

592
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Gotta lay off, that's a stosteroad.

593
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
It hurts so much.

594
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Yeah.

595
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Are you in game?

596
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Yeah.

597
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
She's like so in my ears.

598
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,000
My cliz getting another heartbeat right now every time she talks.

599
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I have a turn with her eye around this.

600
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I love her landing.

601
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
And my fingers turned out like that.

602
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Oopsie.

603
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Oopsie.

604
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I don't know.

605
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I feel like Azura could do a really good Jennifer Coolidge impression.

606
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Jennifer Coolidge.

607
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I don't know Jennifer Coolidge's impression.

608
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
She was like, wait, you don't know Jennifer Coolidge.

609
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Jennifer Coolidge.

610
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I have such big titties.

611
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Oh my god.

612
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Oh my god, Jennifer Coolidge.

613
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Speaking of your chat for the Rizzler.

614
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
That's so good.

615
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Why are we opening our got for the Rizzler?

616
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Drop the bass, plow, plow.

617
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Azura, click that link in the general discord to ring the bell.

618
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Is it not letting you back in?

619
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Have you been reading more?

620
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:51,000
All I hear is screaming.

621
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Your make cuts out with your eyes, Azura.

622
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
So it just goes.

623
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
What's happening?

624
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
It's constantly loading.

625
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,000
It's literally, let me do another invite.

626
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Wait, if I, when you guys see the discord, if I open it up,

627
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
okay, you guys can't see it.

628
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Perfect.

629
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
No, if you do, if you do capture.

630
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I shouldn't see anything else.

631
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I would close the window capture in the, in the OBS just in case.

632
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Yes, you're going to turn off.

633
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Are we restarting a new lobby?

634
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
A new lobby?

635
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I think you're still inviting us lobby.

636
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
A bit of all.

637
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Are we, are we going to another room?

638
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I don't know.

639
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I only see one of you.

640
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
No, on mine.

641
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Sorry.

642
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,000
She's in, she's in.

643
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Okay, which one should we play?

644
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
So you got normal, which we just did.

645
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Knock off, keep yourself focused, try to replicate the drawings

646
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
while the clock gets faster.

647
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Animation, create an animations in a collaborative way.

648
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Icebreaker, play with a sentence, ask questions and have fun with other drawings.

649
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Exquisite co-ops, create surrealist characters connected by the top of the drawings.

650
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Don't know what that means.

651
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Hold on.

652
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I have one.

653
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Burp friends, have a good time with that.

654
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Compliment, complete the sketch.

655
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Start with basic lines and see other players' interpretations.

656
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Masterpiece, create a piece of art, play in a single turn with no time limit.

657
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I feel like story would be funny, right?

658
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
A narrative using only the previous sentence as a reference.

659
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Yes, okay, okay, story, story, story.

660
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
You want to do story?

661
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Yeah, let's try story.

662
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Wait, do I have to write a full story or just a sentence?

663
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Just a sentence.

664
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Just one sentence.

665
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Okay, okay.

666
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Do you like write the whole story or no?

667
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
No, you have really limited characters.

668
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I don't know it.

669
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
No!

670
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
What did you do?

671
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
There's time, there's time.

672
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Yeah, I got 15 seconds, love.

673
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Oh my god, I wanted to write more.

674
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
You can only write one sentence.

675
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I feel like I should be drunk.

676
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
What is this?

677
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
We are not beating the caca allegations with this.

678
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
No, we're not.

679
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
What the fuck is happening?

680
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Oh, they're going to know this is me spelling it because I didn't use a Z on that.

681
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I'm just going to leave it like that.

682
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Yep, I'm sending it.

683
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I'm not even spell checking.

684
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Lack of spell check is good.

685
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Fuck it.

686
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Five seconds.

687
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Fuck it, I'm bad at stories.

688
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
What is this?

689
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
It's mine!

690
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Oh, the sentence is so small.

691
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I want to give a bit more.

692
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I think it gets shorter over time.

693
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I want to feel it vibing.

694
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I couldn't write until, fuck.

695
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
What?

696
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
What's that?

697
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
What's that?

698
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Let's see.

699
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Oh no, what the fuck?

700
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Fuck, I'm so bad at this.

701
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Her name.

702
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
It's funny because...

703
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Oh, I hate this.

704
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I can't think of any names.

705
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
The Reeflings, the Snowberries, the Snickers,

706
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
the Pin Pals,

707
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
the Blean Harps, and the Herum.

708
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I'll get to see this unfold.

709
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
And we're all just taping like...

710
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Fuck it, I don't fuck around.

711
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Wait, is that the fucking...

712
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
And...

713
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
You watch fucking...

714
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Big Bang Theory?

715
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Wait, that's a nice spell.

716
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Paris.

717
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Fuck!

718
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Give me more!

719
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
WolfQuest reference, though.

720
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I need more letters.

721
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I need more like...

722
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Amazing!

723
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
What?

724
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Amazing!

725
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Ten minutes pen song lyrics!

726
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
They jerk so hard, motherfuckers want to find me!

727
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
That sounds like Stevie!

728
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
No!

729
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
They jerk so hard, motherfuckers want to find me!

730
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Wait, I don't know these lyrics.

731
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
This...

732
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
This agency...

733
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
We can't just...

734
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I spelled it wrong, but that's the point.

735
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
I hate that they don't give you enough to write.

736
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
It's like...

737
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Not enough.

738
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Fuck off.

739
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Oh boy, okay, let's see what's happening.

740
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I'll do the auto.

741
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
So how about everybody reads their own story, like whoever did the first line.

742
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Okay, cool.

743
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Okay.

744
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Oh, okay, I go first.

745
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
They also wanted some of the juicy.

746
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Ew, cooties, you're not good.

747
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Why do we both start the same?

748
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
There was a polar bear princess who was trying to fit in too.

749
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Oh.

750
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
My love was stronger than any four in addition.

751
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
They couldn't stop jerking my love for jerk.

752
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
My jerk still hid my love for jerk.

753
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I didn't know I had finished it.

754
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I was like, this agency is crazy.

755
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Ding ding.

756
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Ding ding, that was supposed to be the song, like ding ding.

757
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Ding ding, ding ding, ding ding.

758
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Ding ding ding.

759
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
That was so hard.

760
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Strawny, who was in Paris?

761
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
There was a beach of agency that was lit.

762
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
They all couldn't control their urges.

763
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
So they danced the pee-pee dance until they could.

764
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,000
And then finally, they peed everywhere on the floor,

765
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
the walls, the bed, the kite.

766
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
We're all filled with piss everywhere, but he loved it.

767
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,000
The fact that he was not even a piss prompt before AC came out with that.

768
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
AC couldn't hold it.

769
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
AC put him back to piss.

770
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I'm dying.

771
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I'm dying.

772
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
This is so good.

773
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Once upon a time, there were whores.

774
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
They were the elitists of whores.

775
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
They had a wild west.

776
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
They all had really cute cowgirl.

777
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Pussycat, so cute.

778
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
So fuzzy.

779
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Pussywarm.

780
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Big bang theory, more like bang bang your mom last time.

781
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
You keep my mom out of your damn mouth.

782
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
He's turning to an argument.

783
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
That's the story.

784
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
That's the time they were like...

785
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
She's choking.

786
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Oh no.

787
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Oh no.

788
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Oh no.

789
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I'll save this time.

790
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I can't.

791
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I can't.

792
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
I can't.

793
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I can't.

794
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I can't.

795
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I can't.

796
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I can't.

797
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I can't.

798
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I'm turning from shit to cum.

799
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Oh, my face hurts from laughing.

800
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
This is so bad.

801
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
And now you guys know why I rate the scripts.

802
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Why am I?

803
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I got me in a zero row to buddy each other.

804
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,000
She was sad because she realized she didn't have a prostate.

805
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Why do I keep talking about shit all of that?

806
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Oh, great.

807
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
She became so bad.

808
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I hate this.

809
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Fuck no.

810
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
No.

811
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I didn't want to be pregnant by Sonic.

812
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Azura.

813
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Azura, do you have a mic filter on?

814
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I can never hear you.

815
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Turn that mic.

816
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Get that steel-

817
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
See that steel series.

818
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Oh, fuck.

819
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
If I fart, I'll get everybody's stream.

820
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
You can't.

821
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I deafened so you guys couldn't hear it on all five channels.

822
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
What is happening?

823
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Can't wait for the vote if they survive.

824
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Yeah, these votes.

825
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
They'll be fine.

826
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Don't worry about it.

827
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
You guys want to play this one?

828
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Or do you want to try another one?

829
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Another, another, another.

830
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
New one, new one, new one.

831
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Start with an incomplete drawing each turn.

832
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Please, please.

833
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
No more shit.

834
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
No more shit in piss.

835
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
No.

836
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
No more shit in piss.

837
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
No promises.

838
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Each one.

839
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I didn't even do any shit in piss stuff.

840
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
It was you guys.

841
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Each turn is called compliment.

842
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Compliment.

843
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
All the actions are a mystery.

844
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Drawings and sentences are hidden during the game.

845
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
You can't hear Mercy.

846
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Mercy test.

847
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Mercy test?

848
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Sorry.

849
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Sorry.

850
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
I was muting because I was coughing because I was slapping my side.

851
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Oh, okay.

852
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Okay.

853
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Mercy test complete.

854
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Do you want to do compliment?

855
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
What is that?

856
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Complete the sketch.

857
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
We draw on each other's drawings, basically.

858
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I wish I could do that.

859
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Sure.

860
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I think that would do it.

861
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Yeah.

862
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Can't wait to draw so much piss and shit.

863
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Oh, God.

864
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
That's some basic lines.

865
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Okay.

866
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
I'll do some basic lines.

867
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Okay.

868
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I'll do this.

869
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Maybe I could just...

870
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Maybe I'll do some basic lines.

871
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Okay.

872
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
All right.

873
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Now I'm just going to draw a bunch of dicks.

874
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I like it.

875
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I'll leave it like that.

876
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Castle.

877
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
No!

878
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Are you joking?

879
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
What's that?

880
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
What happened?

881
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
You know exactly what you did.

882
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
And no, I don't have the strength to resist.

883
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
What?

884
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Wait, I got it.

885
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I got it.

886
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I can make this.

887
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I can salvage this.

888
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
This is the back legs of it.

889
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
And then this is its huge milkers.

890
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
And then this is its legs.

891
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
There you go.

892
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Only a few more left.

893
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Yeah.

894
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
You're so dirty.

895
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Reflins.

896
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Don't be so dirty minded.

897
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Honestly.

898
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Reflins.

899
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I'll get the girls to tell you off if you don't behave.

900
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
That's shocking.

901
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
You guys don't have innocent eyes anymore.

902
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Cute.

903
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Rude me.

904
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Wait, quiet is working hard.

905
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Wait, am I supposed to finish this off?

906
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Are we supposed to finish it off?

907
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
I think so because it's given us tons of time.

908
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Hold on.

909
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Oh, okay.

910
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I fixed it.

911
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
I fixed it.

912
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
A big fish up bra.

913
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Oh my god, I've just made shimmy.

914
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
What the hell?

915
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
My name.

916
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Oh wait, that's a thing.

917
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Oh no, that looks like...

918
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Dang it.

919
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Let's just do the pencil.

920
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Here we go.

921
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I saved it.

922
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I saved it.

923
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Baby, give you a lot more time for the second one.

924
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Yeah, you're to finish it.

925
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
You're to finish it.

926
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Ah, you need to finish it.

927
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Okay, I'm fucking stupid.

928
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Never mind.

929
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Okay.

930
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
So am I.

931
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Don't worry.

932
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I saved it.

933
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Lemo girl.

934
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I can't write.

935
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Hell.

936
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Let's put some nice shading in.

937
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
To make this look extra beautiful.

938
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Wow.

939
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Let's put lipstick on.

940
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Yeah.

941
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
So beautiful.

942
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
I saved it.

943
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
They prank him.

944
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I think this is the best I know.

945
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Maybe a bit of fluff on Matteo.

946
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Oh, wait.

947
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Who drew a pair of hairy ball sacks?

948
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
What?

949
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
You're supposed to add the shaft.

950
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
I really know what I want to do,

951
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
but I know I shouldn't do it because we're on YouTube.

952
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I'm fixing this.

953
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Oh, no.

954
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I can't think of one thing.

955
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
This is amazing.

956
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Oh, wait.

957
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Maybe hold on.

958
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Hold on.

959
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
I got it.

960
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I got it.

961
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Hold on.

962
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
I got it.

963
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I got it.

964
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Fuck.

965
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
How do I go back?

966
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Okay.

967
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Fuck.

968
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
What is this?

969
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
They've got a big head.

970
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Look at it.

971
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Oh, I've drawn them too.

972
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Let's practice.

973
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
This is so fucking good.

974
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Let's fucking go.

975
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I'm trying so hard right now.

976
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I can't even think of anything to say.

977
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Oh, my gosh.

978
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Use your imagination.

979
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Use your imagination.

980
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
I can't even think of anything to say.

981
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
I can't even think of anything to say.

982
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
There you go.

983
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Thank you, all.

984
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000

We need to be nice to the earth people.

987
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000

988
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000

1028
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,040

Only oh I got it

1040
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,400
Who's whispering? I

1041
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,240
It's definitely a zero

1042
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:16,720
There is whispering some like evil incantations to us

1043
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,440
I

1044
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:24,160
See it's great. That's not nice. Hold on. This is all I see right now, and I'm not even gonna pretend

1045
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,160
It was definitely a zero that drew the ball sack 100%

1046
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,760
Why does like why do I feel like this is a lie?

1047
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:36,160
No, I didn't draw it. I'm really drawing over it right now

1048
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:43,280
If you guys didn't know a zero's ears. I actually have golden little jewelry on the end of them

00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:51,200
Oh, this is ice. She's pimped out with jewelry, but it's like not a vanity thing. You go

1052
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,760
All right, isn't cheating to erase all fuck it is. Isn't it cute?

1053
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:04,240
All right, so if you didn't know when a woman

1054
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:08,080
When a woman lactates to a hammer

1055
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,680

Oh, it's terrible. Get rid of that

1059
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,520
Oh my god, you can't just control it with my life

1060
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,280
Now I want to start talking about lactation, duh

1070
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,880
Oh, I have to draw my own drawing

I don't even know what to draw for my own drawing

1072
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:37,280
I'm fine. I started it and I'm gonna finish it. It's me

1081
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,400
Yeah

1082
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,440

1196
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,160
That I don't know what to draw

1197
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:12,800
Guys, I mean I give me an idea

01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:15,360
Don't put on the spot

01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:18,320
Don't put me on the spot. I don't know. I don't even know what to draw

1200
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:22,160
Put me on the G spot. I'm just, oh, one of you guys. So I'm gonna choose

1201
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:23,520
On the spot

1202
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:25,520
You want me to draw that?

1203
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:30,880
Oh, this is terrible on a mouse

1204
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:34,720
That one's actually funny

1205
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:37,600
Uh, oh

1206
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:41,040
Can I draw? How much time do we have? I'm like, can I draw the whole gang again?

1207
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:44,240
You have quite a bit of time with this one

1208
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:50,480
Okay, hold on. What the fuck is going to draw the whole gang with this? Oh, that that's not how berries look

1209
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:05,840
How the fuck do you draw something sitting down? Oh my god, I'm having a stroke. I'm not the good kind

1210
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:08,320
What on earth?

1211
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,280
There's a good kind

1212
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:16,240
Oh, very

1213
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
I see after this

1214
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:26,000
Oh my god, what I want to draw harmony. I want to draw you

1215
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:31,440
Perfect I can't draw like this

1216
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,240
Wait, it has kind of like

1217
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:38,160
Who's next we need to draw the devilish

1218
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,920
Fuck this is like I don't know what to fucking draw

1219
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:46,480
Um

1220
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:49,200
Get creative nerds. Jeez. It's not that

1221
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:53,680
Okay, miss artist. Okay

1222
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:03,200
Emmy comes out, Emmy's like, oh, I'm just gonna draw myself casually and it comes out with like this fucking banger of a commission

1223
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:05,920
It would probably cost like 500 dollars to do

1224
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:09,360
Um, she like bangs that out and I'm like, oh my god

1225
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:13,600
He I'm gonna make a vtuber model. He

1226
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:20,560
Wish I could wish I had a finger terrible talent

1227
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:28,160
Speaking of that, so it's heavy a fucking marshmallow. They were like, thank you for not tying down your talents

1228
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:34,240
To the designs that you assigned them and they can be more themselves. And I'm like, yeah, well, why would I do that?

1229
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:40,000
I was like, I don't know why I feel like it's such a basic things. What the fuck do I need to draw now?

1230
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:42,240
A bleeding heart

1231
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:44,480
Yeah, we're just it's almost like we're more so like building upon

1232
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,200
the characters rather than

1233
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,520
changing everything

1234
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:50,400
literally

1235
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:51,840
because um

1236
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:53,680
Oh someone rated the feature bridge

1237
01:05:53,760 --> 01:06:00,000
They were like the only thing that would have been it better is if you let them design their models like from the start

1238
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,680
I'm like, bro. It took me a fucking year to get here. Like, oh my god. Give me

1239
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:07,120
It takes forever to

1240
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,480
Draw and rank a vtuber model. Yeah

1241
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:15,760
You can ask him me. She knows how to she knows how to do it. It's a lot of work

1242
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:24,720
Yeah, there's only a select few corpos that will let you do that

1243
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:31,920
It literally takes so long. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. This is wrong. Usually ones that have like artists in house as well

1244
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:35,760
Yeah, we don't

1245
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:44,640
Most companies if not all of them say first you will have pre

1246
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:47,600
pre-made

1247
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:54,160
Pre-made so it's not actually standard for people to choose. Yeah, it's really not. Yeah

1248
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:57,840
That's why it's usually they cast for the roles

1249
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:01,840
You have to fit the character they're looking for and have the voice

1250
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:09,920
It's magic

1251
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:12,560
You know

1252
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:28,720
Oh

1253
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:31,520
What is this?

1254
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:34,960
Um, oh

1255
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:36,960
Okay

1256
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:44,480
Okay, now we have to draw it. Are we ready?

1257
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:49,200
Yeah, um, no, but I guess I have to be

1258
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:56,720
Even if I'm not it's okay

1259
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:02,560
Just draw it your way and that's the fun part. Yeah, very nice

1260
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:07,040
I've already forgot which position everyone

1261
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:12,560
This is so bad

1262
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:21,920
Sorry, we flinch honestly, I would talk more but this takes so much brain power. I'm literally I'm just like

1263
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:24,880
I'm so brain dead like

1264
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:35,520
I'm reading chat. I'm reading everything, but I'm not responding. I'm so sorry because the everyone see what you're all saying

1265
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:38,560
I'm just really in this

1266
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:44,160
I feel like I'm just fucking losing it

1267
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:51,360
Oh my god, wait, I forgot I forgot there was a shorter time

1268
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:54,560
That's far too short. So it's

1269
01:08:55,200 --> 01:09:01,200
This is why it's chaotic. Why was the other one longer? I don't remember what sugar. I didn't want to do that

1270
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:04,080
Um

1271
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:10,320
Oh my god, what

1272
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:24,880
Oh, fuck the time

1273

Can't remember what it looked like

1276
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:47,040
Is there supposed to be someone in a pirate boat by the way because I don't think I saw it

1277
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:51,040
If there was supposed to be a person in it, I don't know. It's already they've already gone

1278
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:53,760
There's a person

This is a vain reference. I don't know what the fuck i'm doing

1335
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:35,520

1339
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:46,640
I don't know

1340
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:48,640
I'm taking a shot in the dark

1341
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:51,680
Where so you know what that is going to be interpreted as

1342
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:56,240
And will I stop the creative flow? Do you stop?

1350
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:37,120

01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:13,680
But like six like it just it kept crashing like not even like it just wouldn't connect. I don't know if it's because

1439
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:17,840
Um where strani is we couldn't connect properly because she was hosting

1440
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:20,320
Uh

1441
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:22,720
I was like we were so bummed so I'm like, don't worry

1442
01:30:23,680 --> 01:30:26,720
They're like, do we need to end it today? I'm like, no, we don't need to

1443
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:29,120
postpone it

1444
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:34,960
We'll just play something else. And so I ran through like some things. I'm like, okay, gary's mod we can play hide and seek

1445
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:39,040
Or prop one. They're like none of us have it. I'm like, okay. Uh, what about if we do this? They're like, okay

1446
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:40,960
We don't have that. I'm like

1447
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:46,960
Okay, what if you guys get this? Okay. What about jack box because you guys also said jack box and then we realize

1448
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:50,320
Oh, but you would you would all kind of have to be watching my stream

1449
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:53,520
And I'm like, I don't want to take the entire viewership of this collab

1450
01:30:54,160 --> 01:30:55,040
um

1451
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:57,040
because and it would be kind of

1452
01:30:57,360 --> 01:31:00,640
Uh, I don't even think it would be possible for us to stream our

1453
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:02,800
respective

1454
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:03,920
um

1455
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:07,840
Windows properly because you have to like answer everything from a phone anyway

1456
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:13,120
So it doesn't it wouldn't really work out but we might try to work out the kinks of that another time perhaps. I don't know

1457
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:14,960
um

1458
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:16,960
I feel like that's a good like

1459
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:23,120
Uh stream with like, uh, you guys because it's a little bit easier because you guys all look at your own phone or whatever

1460
01:31:23,680 --> 01:31:25,680
um, and then

1461
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:28,720
Yeah, it all ended well because I was like, oh wait, what's that freaking

1462
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:31,360
Pictionary like game

1463
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:36,480
And I was like isn't there like garter phone. I'm like, okay perfect. I've never played guard like I've never played garter phone before

1464
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:38,960
um, but

1465
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:40,640
like

1466
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:45,120
I will always I just noticed strani is a piece of pizza. Uh, I will always

1467
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:50,800
Like because I could tell strani was getting stressed. I'm like, don't worry. We'll be fine. We got this

1468
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:55,680
Um, we don't have to postpone it. We don't have to just like we don't have to cancel anything

1469
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:58,080
I was gonna I what I wanted to do

1470
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:02,720
I wanted to do like csgo commentator

1471
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:07,280
Of like them playing power wash like really badly and just like not be in it

1472
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:10,400
Like so you guys wouldn't have like I was just would have still streamed

1473
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:14,560
What you guys wouldn't have gotten my viewpoint. Uh, I would probably just like

1474
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:20,560
react stream to like strani's uh, or like emmy's thing. Um

1475
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:26,000
The northerline crew do jackbox a lot. Yeah, so I'm like, I know it's possible

1476
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:29,920
But we just don't we'll probably break up the kinks for that. Um

1477
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:36,400
But yeah, everything worked out fine. I'm glad we had lots of fun time

1478
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:41,200
I always love hanging out with them. I also just like didn't want to postpone hanging out though

1479
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:47,760
Because we hadn't um, like we'll talk all the time in like chat, but we haven't like, um, played a game together in a bit

1480
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:52,400
So I was like, oh no, I want to I want to hang out with my girls

1481
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:55,760
Oh, like anything happened

1482
01:32:57,120 --> 01:33:02,720
Yeah, what honestly you would have you would have liked what strani had um set up for

1483
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:09,120
Power wash because we were gonna do like a little q&a and like the little skit where we're trying to like make money

1484
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:16,480
Because nobody watches us or whatever. So we just resort to power washing. Um, but yeah, we're we are

1485
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:19,600
Like I think we all have really good chemistry

1486
01:33:20,160 --> 01:33:26,880
As a group we're all just so goofy together and I I just love it so much like I wouldn't I wouldn't ask for

1487
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:31,120
any other group of hilarious freaking girls because

1488
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:39,120
Like we all like some of us will surprise each other like the freakiest shit like just like like evi today like just

1489
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:41,120
doing the most

1490
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:43,120
silly drawings

1491
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:45,920
In like

1492
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:48,480
It's just fun

1493
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:54,480
We need to get I see more hobbies than piss in older men

1494
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:59,840
Yeah, because it's like we all have our little like jokes that we stick to um

1495
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:06,320
Which is but like also like toilet humor is funny like I'm sorry it kind of is that in slapstick humor

1496
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:08,320
But we can't exactly do slapstick online

1497
01:34:09,680 --> 01:34:11,680
Um, unless it's like maybe like a 3d thing

1498
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:15,280
Excuse me

1499
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:17,280
