01:30.000 --> 02:00.000
I'm going to do a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little

02:00.000 --> 02:30.000
bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit

02:30.000 --> 03:00.000
of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of

03:00.000 --> 03:30.000
a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a

03:30.000 --> 03:30.280
little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little tail of a little big

03:41.280 --> 03:43.280
screws

03:46.640 --> 03:48.640
after the sign

03:55.140 --> 03:57.140
I just woke up

03:57.140 --> 03:59.540
so you get the sleepy

04:00.000 --> 04:10.800
I was like, it was like 4.58, um, like, gets up, crawls to desk, turns on stream.

04:10.800 --> 04:21.740
I might need to- I think I need to have an idle meeting when I'm not sure yet.

04:21.740 --> 04:23.740
But how are you guys doing?

04:23.740 --> 04:24.740
I'm doing fine.

04:24.740 --> 04:26.240
I hope you're doing fine.

04:27.040 --> 04:31.840
I could have slept a little longer, but it's kind of better I don't, because, oh my god,

04:31.840 --> 04:38.400
I'm so big at the hell I'm trying to scroll, so that, um, I'm echoing, I hate it when I do that.

04:38.400 --> 04:44.000
Um, so that, oh, it's my turn to putt.

04:49.360 --> 04:52.160
That should have been a warning sign.

04:52.160 --> 04:59.520
Oh yeah, so I have to wear this on me because YouTube doesn't like my bosom, so I'm hiding it.

04:59.520 --> 05:03.920
Out of shame, I'm so shameful.

05:03.920 --> 05:08.320
I'm so terrible for YouTube.

05:08.320 --> 05:15.600
Um, I am getting a cover-up, uh, eventually, so.

05:15.600 --> 05:18.560
And it'll probably just be my shirt button, which is nice.

05:18.640 --> 05:20.640
I might have got my nose itches.

05:23.120 --> 05:25.440
YouTube does pick and choose, yes.

05:25.440 --> 05:30.320
Um, let me see.

05:30.320 --> 05:33.200
Literally one of my favorite games of all time, plus she be streaming it.

05:33.200 --> 05:34.720
I'm being good today.

05:34.720 --> 05:36.560
Um, I love Inscription.

05:36.560 --> 05:42.640
Inscription is one of my favorite games of all time, so I know some of you guys have that in common.

05:43.360 --> 05:51.440
It is, if you don't know what Inscription is, Inscription is a, um, it's a card, turn-based card

05:51.440 --> 05:54.480
game, and cards have unique properties.

05:55.520 --> 06:01.520
You do all very interesting characters that have very cool little perks that they got.

06:02.640 --> 06:07.360
The ambiance is amazing, the plot is amazing, it's very meta.

06:08.320 --> 06:14.080
I highly recommend, if you've never played Inscription after, um, watching me today,

06:14.080 --> 06:14.800
please play it.

06:14.800 --> 06:16.320
It's such a good game.

06:16.320 --> 06:18.160
I've played through the game multiple times.

06:19.280 --> 06:28.560
Some of you who might be from, um, my PL have seen me play it before, and my Inscription streams

06:28.560 --> 06:34.080
where I know some of people's favorites, because I gave everybody very funny voices.

06:37.920 --> 06:41.760
But yeah, it's a very, very good, uh, good game.

06:41.760 --> 06:48.880
We're going to be doing Casey's Mod, so a Casey's Mod is that it extends the first portion of the

06:48.880 --> 06:52.000
game, because there's several sections of the game.

06:52.000 --> 06:58.800
There's different phases, um, and because, of course, it's the one you first start off with,

06:58.800 --> 07:05.840
the first phase of the game, or the first half, or whatever portion, um, is a fan favorite of

07:05.840 --> 07:09.920
everybody's, um, for the graphics, the characters, what have you.

07:09.920 --> 07:14.320
So Casey's Mod expands that, so it lasts a little bit longer.

07:14.960 --> 07:22.800
We have Crowd Control, I'm going to, I don't, I don't know how it will work with Inscription,

07:22.800 --> 07:23.760
but we'll see.

07:23.760 --> 07:24.800
I'm very excited.

07:24.800 --> 07:30.240
I've never played it with the Crowd Control with Inscription before, so that'll be fun.

07:30.960 --> 07:40.880
Um, somebody also asked, uh, if I'm replacing Strani and the, uh, Uno collab tomorrow, uh,

07:40.880 --> 07:45.600
or, sorry, the day after, or Sunday, I can't remember, I just woke up, let me alone.

07:45.600 --> 07:51.040
Um, yes, I am, because I was supposed to be in it in the first place.

07:51.040 --> 07:56.320
Uh, she only subbed in for me, because I couldn't join because of work.

07:56.320 --> 08:01.360
But now, since I quit my job, I can be back in it.

08:01.360 --> 08:05.920
So I apologize if that disappoints you, I completely understand if it does.

08:06.720 --> 08:12.800
Um, but, yeah, I still hope you think we'll have fun, because I know we will.

08:14.400 --> 08:17.760
Um, yeah, it's no work now, yay.

08:17.760 --> 08:18.640
Saturday, yes.

08:19.360 --> 08:25.920
Um, yeah, it's stupid, Uno only has four players, like it's so dumb,

08:25.920 --> 08:32.640
it should be like six or eight, like at max in my opinion, but you know, it is what it is,

08:32.640 --> 08:35.360
you know, it's owned by Ubisoft, so what the fuck, whatever.

08:35.840 --> 08:38.400
Um, hold on, Uno reverse card.

08:39.120 --> 08:44.000
Uh, the graphic, the thumbnail artist, I was like, I realized after they're like,

08:44.000 --> 08:48.560
oh, what do you want me to put on your thumbnail?

08:48.560 --> 08:52.080
And I'm like, so, and they show me examples of like,

08:52.160 --> 08:59.280
Shawnee's, and it was like, um, stop saying you're inking yourself for five minutes or draw 25.

08:59.280 --> 09:05.520
So, uh, I did stop doing wacky voices for five minutes, but what I should have done

09:05.520 --> 09:11.440
was stop getting demonetized for five minutes or draw 25.

09:11.440 --> 09:13.280
And I thought would have been funner.

09:13.280 --> 09:16.160
Um, but it is what it is.

09:16.160 --> 09:18.080
It's still, it's still silly.

09:19.040 --> 09:24.160
Although like, it was funny that the Azura, the collab I have with Azura,

09:24.160 --> 09:27.520
it did get limited ads, which I thought was really funny.

09:27.520 --> 09:31.680
I don't, I seem to have fallen asleep in excitement.

09:32.480 --> 09:35.440
Well, I'll just talk like this, I guess.

09:35.440 --> 09:39.440
Um, it might be my wifi.

09:39.440 --> 09:41.520
It's, it's been like really hot today.

09:41.520 --> 09:47.360
I wouldn't be surprised if like, I don't know, freaking fire happens or lose power or what have you.

09:47.360 --> 09:49.600
It's just, it's, it's the hottest it's been.

09:49.600 --> 09:50.960
It's been a long time in my area.

09:51.600 --> 09:58.160
Um, but, uh, I did get limited ads, but I appealed it and they accepted it.

09:59.280 --> 10:00.080
It's fine.

10:02.560 --> 10:03.600
So it's good.

10:03.600 --> 10:04.560
It's fine.

10:04.560 --> 10:05.680
Oh, I've woken up.

10:07.680 --> 10:14.320
Um, I, I literally was so tired after, hold on.

10:14.960 --> 10:17.360
Where did my BGM go for just chatting?

10:17.360 --> 10:17.840
Hello?

10:18.800 --> 10:19.680
That's so weird.

10:19.680 --> 10:25.840
I should have it here instead of me just like talking incessantly.

10:25.840 --> 10:28.480
I'll have you have some music with it.

10:30.800 --> 10:33.760
Um, there we go.

10:33.760 --> 10:34.240
That's fine.

10:36.400 --> 10:37.120
Cool beans.

10:37.120 --> 10:41.200
Um, what was I going to say?

10:42.080 --> 10:44.240
Oh, uh, so I went into the grocery store.

10:44.240 --> 10:48.880
I haven't been in the grocery store and ground grocery shopping and like maybe a month or two.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.720
I usually, like, I don't really eat a lot.

10:54.720 --> 11:01.040
I like, you guys, like I'll usually just like door dash a meal and that's my thing for the day,

11:01.040 --> 11:03.440
which I'm like, that's probably not healthy.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.600
Just eating one meal a day.

11:06.240 --> 11:09.040
Hey, but I have like apple juice and water.

11:11.360 --> 11:13.360
So I got some snacks.

11:13.360 --> 11:18.880
I was really pissed though, because I, I'm like, I said, I mentioned like power going out and stuff

11:18.880 --> 11:28.480
on just because in the, um, the frozen food section of my supermarket, the power was out.

11:28.480 --> 11:30.480
So all, I feel bad for the supermarket.

11:30.480 --> 11:32.720
So they're like, you can't open the doors.

11:32.720 --> 11:40.160
I'm like, then why even have this place open if we can't open any of the fast, not the fast food,

11:40.160 --> 11:41.760
the frozen food section.

11:41.760 --> 11:46.640
And like, I was going to get a pizza and or like some like

11:48.240 --> 11:51.440
salmon because I love salmon and I couldn't even do that.

11:51.440 --> 11:53.760
So I literally just got like snacks.

11:53.760 --> 11:58.640
I have, I have, um, Emmy, Mammy, want beef, uh, beef jerky.

11:58.640 --> 12:00.640
So I got beef jerky next to me.

12:00.640 --> 12:08.000
I've already eaten half of a bueno and I have an airhead next to me and I'm like,

12:08.000 --> 12:09.840
I literally went food shopping.

12:09.840 --> 12:11.440
Like I'm a fucking teenager.

12:13.600 --> 12:19.920
But, um, yeah, I have to like actually, I'll probably go to another supermarket tomorrow

12:20.640 --> 12:28.400
and like get like, um, usually I'll get like steak or like some sort of unlike some poultry.

12:29.200 --> 12:36.000
Um, I do, I do, I did see my little, it's funny because people are like, oh,

12:36.320 --> 12:42.960
oh, should you be, you put, you added hello fresh on your alt account.

12:43.600 --> 12:45.680
Oh, did you know you were doing?

12:45.680 --> 12:46.640
Yes, I did.

12:46.640 --> 12:47.600
That was the point.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.320
It was, it was funny because I knew I would get interaction.

12:53.040 --> 12:54.080
You guys have been tricked.

12:55.440 --> 13:01.760
And also, um, I tweeted from that account because I thought it would get more attention

13:01.760 --> 13:03.840
because it has more followers than my main.

13:04.400 --> 13:08.320
But then I was just like, wait, I don't want them to think I'm just a whore

13:09.280 --> 13:10.240
because I'm more than that.

13:10.240 --> 13:11.840
I'm more than just a whore, okay.

13:12.480 --> 13:16.960
Um, so I, that's when I added, I was like, uh, oh shit, add this.

13:16.960 --> 13:21.200
But yeah, you guys can believe the other thing that I did it on accident.

13:22.400 --> 13:23.120
That's okay.

13:23.120 --> 13:23.680
Don't be mad.

13:23.680 --> 13:24.400
You got baited.

13:24.400 --> 13:25.520
I sound like I'm drunk.

13:25.520 --> 13:29.760
I sound like a girl at a party that's like, hey, do you want to come home with me?

13:30.480 --> 13:32.560
Like my ride kind of ditched me.

13:32.560 --> 13:34.160
So like, can you take me home?

13:35.120 --> 13:37.920
No, I've only had like a couple shots.

13:37.920 --> 13:38.960
It's not a big deal.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.600
I'm not going to puke in your car.

13:41.600 --> 13:42.800
Just take me home.

13:42.800 --> 13:43.280
All right.

13:43.920 --> 13:44.480
All right.

13:44.480 --> 13:44.960
Thank you.

13:45.920 --> 13:48.480
Um, I'm such a kidder.

13:48.480 --> 13:48.720
Yeah.

13:50.480 --> 13:50.960
Fresh.

13:50.960 --> 13:52.080
She'd be banned.

13:52.800 --> 13:57.520
Um, I wonder if one fourth of your grocery bills is actual hood.

13:57.520 --> 13:59.600
Like, yeah, I got like some Cheerios.

13:59.600 --> 14:00.240
I got milk.

14:00.240 --> 14:03.280
I got like way too much juice, I will say.

14:03.280 --> 14:06.560
I'm like, I got like two, two different types of seltzer.

14:06.560 --> 14:08.960
I got some ginger ale because my tummy has been upset.

14:10.560 --> 14:11.840
I don't drink soda often.

14:11.840 --> 14:15.840
I'm like, you know, I'll make up, I'll make an exception with ginger ale.

14:15.840 --> 14:16.400
That's better.

14:16.400 --> 14:16.640
Right.

14:17.120 --> 14:18.640
Um, it's not.

14:19.920 --> 14:23.840
And then I got some, I realized they got two types of apple juice.

14:23.840 --> 14:26.640
I got apple juice in a pouch.

14:26.640 --> 14:33.120
And then I got apple juice in the, like in the giant container of apple juice,

14:33.120 --> 14:34.240
like a jug of apple juice.

14:34.240 --> 14:38.880
And I was like, well, I thought I grabbed the peach tea, but I grabbed the apple juice.

14:38.880 --> 14:40.800
So I guess I have one apple juice.

14:42.400 --> 14:44.720
And then I got lemonade.

14:44.720 --> 14:45.600
Did I grab lemonade?

14:45.600 --> 14:46.000
I don't know.

14:46.800 --> 14:49.200
And I realized I got milk when I already had milk.

14:49.200 --> 14:51.040
And I'm like, you know, you can never get too much milk.

14:51.040 --> 14:55.200
I don't drink milk because like just like a zero, I'm lactose intolerant.

14:55.200 --> 14:58.880
And I really shouldn't be having milk or gluten for that matter because, uh,

14:58.880 --> 15:04.320
fiber actually, um, dairy and gluten cause inflammation if you didn't know that.

15:04.320 --> 15:07.440
So if you're having inflammation problems, don't eat that stuff.

15:07.440 --> 15:13.280
But, um, I don't live in California where everybody and their mom is like vegetarian

15:13.280 --> 15:16.160
and gluten free or whatever have you.

15:16.160 --> 15:20.480
So I will eat it anyways at the expense of my physical health.

15:21.440 --> 15:22.800
And also because it tastes good.

15:23.440 --> 15:24.400
No one can stop me.

15:26.160 --> 15:27.200
Uh, lactose free.

15:27.200 --> 15:31.840
There was like, honestly, when things say that they're lactose free,

15:31.840 --> 15:34.880
I don't really believe it cause like I'll drink lactate.

15:35.440 --> 15:37.280
I'll still have tummy issues.

15:37.280 --> 15:38.320
I don't know what it is.

15:39.520 --> 15:41.040
There's this other drink.

15:41.040 --> 15:43.840
There's this other type of milk I got that's lactose free.

15:43.840 --> 15:45.120
I still get tummy issues.

15:45.120 --> 15:48.000
So maybe it's another thing within the milk that makes me sick.

15:48.000 --> 15:48.480
I don't know.

15:49.200 --> 15:50.560
It really just makes me fart a lot.

15:50.560 --> 15:51.600
So not a big deal.

15:51.680 --> 16:00.240
Um, like, uh, like I mentioned, like saying that, um, I was watching the boys yesterday

16:01.040 --> 16:03.840
and saying that like in the homelander was like drinking a milkshake.

16:03.840 --> 16:05.680
And I was like, oh, I'd love to drink a milkshake.

16:05.680 --> 16:08.560
And then I got a milkshake this morning.

16:09.360 --> 16:10.160
Surprise.

16:10.160 --> 16:14.160
I treated myself and, um, I was just farting up a storm.

16:14.160 --> 16:16.000
So sorry.

16:16.000 --> 16:16.640
Almond milk.

16:17.360 --> 16:21.360
I don't, my, I don't know.

16:21.360 --> 16:21.920
What it is.

16:21.920 --> 16:27.120
I don't like the texture of most like the only type of milk I can drink.

16:27.120 --> 16:28.480
That's not actual milk.

16:28.480 --> 16:30.320
Milk is probably oat milk.

16:30.320 --> 16:32.240
Almond milk tastes like spit to me.

16:32.800 --> 16:34.880
Um, I also don't like eggnog for that reason.

16:34.880 --> 16:38.400
It feels like spit in my mouth and not like the fun kind.

16:39.120 --> 16:41.920
It's just like someone hacked a loogie and that's,

16:42.960 --> 16:46.960
it's only fun when I do it to you and when it's in a naughty sense,

16:46.960 --> 16:48.880
not when I'm like trying to have cereal.

16:48.880 --> 16:52.160
I don't want to have a spit bowl of spit milk cereal.

16:52.160 --> 16:53.680
I'm good with that, but thank you.

16:54.480 --> 16:56.560
I'm sounding like such a valley girl right now.

16:56.560 --> 16:57.920
What the fuck is going on?

17:00.560 --> 17:01.920
Um, but yeah.

17:03.840 --> 17:05.360
I'm wearing overalls.

17:05.360 --> 17:08.720
I'm going to take them off because they're starting to write up my cooch.

17:08.720 --> 17:09.520
Well, I'm sitting.

17:11.840 --> 17:14.320
I have a song stuck in my head.

17:15.280 --> 17:19.840
K-Tranota and Pink Pantherous did a song together,

17:19.840 --> 17:24.960
which blessed my beautiful bunny ears called Snap My Fingers.

17:25.520 --> 17:29.680
And I have her vocal stuck in my head and I'm like, oh my God.

17:30.240 --> 17:31.360
I love Pink Pantherous.

17:31.360 --> 17:33.200
Oh my God, just stepped in a shit ton of litter.

17:33.920 --> 17:38.400
Um, thank you, uh, by the way, for whomever purchased.

17:38.400 --> 17:44.160
Um, or just like you guys been heavily, heavily, heavily supporting me on Throne.

17:44.320 --> 17:47.440
And I appreciate that a lot because I, as you see, I don't put like

17:48.480 --> 17:51.200
a lot of like weeb shit or clothes or cute shit.

17:51.200 --> 17:52.960
I'm like, I need stuff for my house.

17:52.960 --> 17:56.640
And I appreciate it so much when you guys help me with that.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.560
I'm like, I need a vacuum.

17:58.560 --> 18:01.440
I need, can I have, can I have a bed frame?

18:01.440 --> 18:05.040
I like, oh my God, my bed frame was so heavy and I dropped it on my foot

18:05.040 --> 18:06.720
and I have a giant bruise on my foot now.

18:07.440 --> 18:09.680
Um, that actually doesn't look that bad.

18:09.680 --> 18:11.200
It looks bad when I first happened.

18:11.200 --> 18:11.920
But thank you.

18:11.920 --> 18:13.280
I appreciate you guys so much.

18:13.360 --> 18:17.440
Um, I don't want to sleep on a mattress on the floor anymore.

18:18.240 --> 18:22.000
I don't know how I'm going to, like in my bed is, my bed is big.

18:22.800 --> 18:28.720
I have, um, despite being like just me, I have a king size bed.

18:29.280 --> 18:35.040
Um, because I have three cats and they take up one side of the bed.

18:35.040 --> 18:40.080
And then I was just like, oh, if I get a dog, because when I move,

18:40.080 --> 18:42.800
like probably get my own house, I'm probably gonna get a dog.

18:42.800 --> 18:45.040
I'm like, where's the dog going to sleep?

18:45.040 --> 18:46.560
He's got to sleep in bed with me.

18:47.600 --> 18:47.920
Okay.

18:47.920 --> 18:50.160
Cause you know, I need like have a little puppy.

18:50.160 --> 18:51.680
Um, you know, chilling.

18:51.680 --> 18:52.080
Don't worry.

18:52.080 --> 18:53.680
If I got a dog, I would create, train it.

18:53.680 --> 18:54.560
I'm, I'm very good.

18:55.200 --> 18:58.240
Um, my family friends are dog trainers.

18:58.240 --> 19:00.080
So probably seek their wisdom.

19:00.080 --> 19:02.240
But like, I, I, I also move around.

19:03.760 --> 19:07.040
I'm weird and I also move around a lot in bed.

19:07.680 --> 19:12.800
So my mom always made fun of me cause as a baby, um, or like younger,

19:12.800 --> 19:15.200
I would always sleep in like a crescent shape.

19:15.200 --> 19:17.040
Like, I don't know what, not like my arms out,

19:17.040 --> 19:20.080
but I would just like curl to the ball, like the side of the ball.

19:20.720 --> 19:24.320
And lately when I wake up in bed, I realized if, I don't know if I'm having

19:24.320 --> 19:28.320
restless sleep, but I realized I'm waking up completely sideways.

19:30.000 --> 19:35.840
Like I just, I'm literally horizontal, not vertical on my bed.

19:35.840 --> 19:37.840
And I'm like, good thing I have a giant bed.

19:37.840 --> 19:42.240
So big bed for real little girls to sleep at the foot of the bed.

19:42.240 --> 19:43.040
Exactly.

19:43.040 --> 19:43.760
Hi, Mercy.

19:45.280 --> 19:47.040
I have a little spot for mercy.

19:47.920 --> 19:52.880
It, I like, and then, and it's like, if one of the girls slept over,

19:52.880 --> 19:57.360
which I would love to host the girls at my apartment, if that ever happened,

19:57.360 --> 19:58.320
it would be so funny.

19:58.800 --> 20:00.800
Um, cause I have enough room.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.960
I could probably get like a blowout mattress.

20:02.960 --> 20:04.480
My walking closet is huge.

20:04.480 --> 20:06.960
I could literally fit like a twin in there.

20:06.960 --> 20:12.080
Um, and then someone could take the couch and my couch turns into a bed

20:12.080 --> 20:13.440
cause you girls smart.

20:14.720 --> 20:20.320
And, uh, I have space on my floor and then one of the girls,

20:20.320 --> 20:22.560
I probably could fit two of the girls in bed with me.

20:23.440 --> 20:33.440
So, you know, although like, yeah, I think I'm the tallest out of all the girls.

20:33.440 --> 20:37.680
So I probably, I probably give the girls my bed cause I'm nice like that.

20:37.680 --> 20:38.960
And I'll be like, I'll sleep on the floor.

20:39.840 --> 20:40.400
Uh, yeah.

20:40.400 --> 20:46.800
The couch, honestly, so it's like, um, like, sorry, I just looked over at Boomi

20:46.800 --> 20:53.360
and he, you know that one picture of that cat in that, um, eating food in that one

20:53.360 --> 20:58.240
like feeder food thing and he's, it's like the recording them and stuff.

20:58.240 --> 21:01.760
And then they have names, you know, the one with like the sassy side eye.

21:01.760 --> 21:07.040
I just looked over and he was looking at me like that and it took me by surprise how

21:07.040 --> 21:09.600
much he looks like the cat looking up after eating food going.

21:12.400 --> 21:14.720
Um, you fight for the chance to sleep.

21:14.720 --> 21:24.080
She be, um, but my couch, um, and this is because like I, I have family outside, um,

21:24.960 --> 21:31.200
of my state and sometimes like my parents house is too small to probably like to have

21:31.200 --> 21:32.800
people like stay there.

21:32.800 --> 21:38.480
So I got, um, for my grandparents and my aunts and uncles when they come up from Florida,

21:38.480 --> 21:41.520
um, like, wait, it just stalks my family.

21:41.520 --> 21:42.400
I don't really care though.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.200
I forget it.

21:45.920 --> 21:50.000
I have a, oh my God, Reina is singing the song of her people.

21:52.320 --> 21:53.200
Can you guys hear that?

21:55.440 --> 21:57.760
She has her fuzzy ball and she likes to yell with it.

21:58.560 --> 22:01.840
Um, the couch is like an L shaped couch.

22:01.840 --> 22:05.360
It's kind of small, but like there's this little thing you can pull out and it makes

22:05.360 --> 22:09.680
it turn into a bed and you can put like a little bed pad on it and then just like have

22:09.680 --> 22:13.280
some blankets and I have a lot of blankets and I have so many blankets.

22:14.080 --> 22:14.800
I got you.

22:14.800 --> 22:18.800
So you're not going to be given like a cardboard box to cover yourself in when you sleep over.

22:19.440 --> 22:24.800
Um, if any of the girls watching right now have concern that if you shared the bed with

22:24.800 --> 22:28.560
any of them, you might accidentally straight, just wrangle across like toss and turn to you.

22:28.560 --> 22:31.600
I probably would just smack one of them in the face on accident.

22:32.560 --> 22:37.280
Um, I probably, yeah, I would probably just like flip.

22:37.280 --> 22:40.480
That's why I'm like, I'll sleep on the floor like in my closet.

22:41.520 --> 22:45.680
You could have probably two girls on the couch, three girls in my bed.

22:45.680 --> 22:46.960
So that, yeah, it works out.

22:48.560 --> 22:48.880
Yeah.

22:48.880 --> 22:50.880
The harem can get the cardboard.

22:50.880 --> 22:54.160
You guys can, you guys can sleep next to me on the floor and I'll just, you know,

22:54.160 --> 22:56.800
pull a little piece of cardboard on you for, for warmth.

22:56.800 --> 22:59.360
You can sleep on some cardboard and then you get a cardboard blanket.

23:00.320 --> 23:03.680
I would say thank you if you smacked me in the face.

23:05.360 --> 23:10.160
Um, no, I would never intentionally hit one of the girls unless they're like

23:11.600 --> 23:14.160
subconsciously they tell me to do that while I'm sleeping.

23:14.160 --> 23:16.480
If they're like whispering into me and they're like, hit me, hit me, hit me.

23:16.480 --> 23:21.280
I'm not going to, I also, um, tend to snore.

23:21.280 --> 23:29.440
So I was like thinking about doing for my doughnut on this like sleeping on stream.

23:30.320 --> 23:37.200
I stream and I'm like, I'm definitely going to snore, but that's fine.

23:37.200 --> 23:38.000
I think it's funny.

23:39.280 --> 23:40.320
You can bully me for that.

23:40.320 --> 23:44.080
I don't mind boxing off collab would go kind of hard.

23:44.080 --> 23:48.960
I've always wanted to do kickboxing, um, but my body is nice and frail now

23:49.600 --> 23:55.840
after having COVID and that's what set off the, the, the physical bomb within my body

23:55.840 --> 23:56.880
that gave me fibro.

23:58.480 --> 23:59.600
Do you talk in your sleep?

23:59.600 --> 24:04.000
I don't, I don't sleeping with madam.

24:05.520 --> 24:07.760
I think sleeping streams are allowed on YouTube.

24:07.760 --> 24:08.560
I'm not quite sure.

24:09.440 --> 24:12.560
Uh, I thought with your jujitsu back room and you excel in kickboxing.

24:12.560 --> 24:13.200
Yes.

24:13.200 --> 24:18.640
Like I, but like keep in mind, I haven't, I haven't done jujitsu in quite a

24:18.640 --> 24:19.920
bit because of one.

24:19.920 --> 24:21.120
I injured my shoulder really bad.

24:21.120 --> 24:22.400
Someone tackled me really good.

24:22.400 --> 24:26.960
I don't know if it popped it out of place, but I have like eternal bursitis in that

24:26.960 --> 24:27.360
shoulder.

24:28.320 --> 24:29.520
Oh, hi, bro.

24:29.520 --> 24:30.560
Thank you for the soup.

24:31.520 --> 24:34.480
One of the girls tickling your nose with the feather while the other presents herself.

24:34.480 --> 24:35.280
She's in the way of your hand.

24:35.280 --> 24:37.760
We try to swat away the thing tickling.

24:37.760 --> 24:39.360
I need that as an art piece.

24:39.360 --> 24:40.720
I, I need that drawn.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.120
Thank you for the time.

24:45.040 --> 24:45.280
Yeah.

24:45.840 --> 24:47.680
And COVID stopped us from getting you in the UFC.

24:48.240 --> 24:49.520
Dude, you have no idea.

24:49.520 --> 24:53.200
Cause I was, I was going to start competing at that point.

24:53.200 --> 24:55.760
Um, then COVID happened, which sucked.

24:56.560 --> 25:02.880
But my, my teacher was just like, it's, I think it's time that you start competing.

25:02.880 --> 25:07.520
And I had been there for, um, I forget how long, but I was just like, I was so hyped.

25:07.520 --> 25:08.320
I was so ready.

25:09.440 --> 25:12.720
Then, you know, everybody gets like, it's funny.

25:12.720 --> 25:17.040
People like, oh, you do jujitsu and then it's either they respond with yes or they're

25:17.040 --> 25:20.480
like, nah, I got injured and I'm the latter.

25:20.480 --> 25:22.000
I'm not, I got injured.

25:22.000 --> 25:25.040
I'm no chef, but boy are these titties sweaty today.

25:28.160 --> 25:28.720
I'm sorry.

25:28.720 --> 25:30.080
I was reading something on Twitter.

25:30.080 --> 25:32.160
Um, but it actually fits a lot.

25:32.160 --> 25:36.640
I'm going to retweet that because I was literally taking off my bra at the same time

25:36.640 --> 25:38.560
as I was reading that because my titties are sweaty.

25:39.360 --> 25:42.640
Um, but yeah, and I also bruise really easily.

25:42.880 --> 25:48.000
Uh, I have arthritis at the young age of 56.

25:48.000 --> 25:52.880
So in my neck, I remember I used to, I had to get injections in my neck and I know I

25:52.880 --> 25:56.560
need another one because my shoulder is acting up again because it's all nerve pain and shit.

25:57.120 --> 26:02.160
And that's why my fingers go numb and turn really, really white when I'm cold.

26:02.160 --> 26:03.440
I don't really care though.

26:03.440 --> 26:06.720
And then my customer is like, you could definitely have renoite syndrome.

26:06.720 --> 26:15.520
Um, but, um, uh, I remember I was getting injections in my neck and it was cool because

26:15.520 --> 26:20.000
the way that I was angled, I can kind of see the doctor like putting the needles in because

26:20.000 --> 26:24.960
you had to, he had to put like the ports in first and near my spine.

26:25.680 --> 26:30.640
Um, cause it's like on the lower part of my neck and then, then he had to inject it into

26:30.640 --> 26:36.240
the ports and I could see the ports going into my neck and I was like, holy, this is cool.

26:36.800 --> 26:38.240
I also had a valium that day.

26:38.240 --> 26:39.840
So I probably thought anything was cool.

26:39.840 --> 26:44.000
I never had valium before, but I felt like I was in amnesia, the dark descent.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.440
So I was having a great time.

26:46.080 --> 26:49.600
Um, I had really bad anxiety for that.

26:49.600 --> 26:57.360
So my mom drove me to and from, uh, and so the doctor afterwards, and I'm like on valium,

26:57.360 --> 27:02.400
mind you, and he's just like, so like, do you do a lot of like contact sports?

27:02.400 --> 27:05.760
And I'm like, no, I haven't done a jiu-jitsu for like a year.

27:05.760 --> 27:07.840
And he's just like, yeah, this wouldn't do that.

27:07.840 --> 27:09.760
He's like, do you do any horseback riding?

27:09.760 --> 27:13.520
I'm like, I did when I was like, like years ago.

27:13.520 --> 27:17.520
And they're just like, oh, it looks like you've been doing it recently because your

27:17.520 --> 27:20.800
like neck, it looks like it's been like bobbing a lot.

27:20.800 --> 27:25.120
And I'm like, like it's been jostled and like shaken around and just like,

27:25.120 --> 27:27.920
rut like, like my bones have grinded against each other.

27:28.560 --> 27:31.600
And I'm just like, no, I'm not.

27:31.600 --> 27:33.200
And they're like, do you stand on your head?

27:33.200 --> 27:34.240
Like, do you do yoga?

27:34.240 --> 27:34.960
I'm like, no.

27:36.240 --> 27:42.240
So my bone, like after like, I got hit when I got COVID the first time I was fine.

27:42.240 --> 27:47.280
The second time I was like, I like my body was a mess.

27:47.280 --> 27:51.040
And I like set off like all this fucking inflammation to my body because I was perfectly

27:51.040 --> 27:56.400
fine before I ever had COVID, never had an issue, never had like the worst thing was

27:56.400 --> 27:57.760
that I wore fucking glasses.

27:59.360 --> 28:00.240
So much for that.

28:01.440 --> 28:03.200
Do you stand on your head on a regular basis?

28:04.080 --> 28:07.520
Have you been spending time in a giant novelty washing machine lately?

28:07.520 --> 28:09.840
And, um, yeah.

28:09.840 --> 28:15.120
And so like, I have it in both sides of my neck and in my ankles, like pretty much on my joints.

28:15.840 --> 28:24.720
And they're just, and like, I'm in my 50s, very young for my age.

28:24.720 --> 28:27.040
Okay. So they were very confused by that.

28:27.040 --> 28:31.360
And a lot of doctors wouldn't believe me when I said like, I was feeling this

28:32.000 --> 28:36.720
symptom or that symptom because they're like, oh, that sounds like this rheumatoid or like

28:36.720 --> 28:38.320
fibro or this or that.

28:38.320 --> 28:39.280
And my mom is fibro.

28:39.280 --> 28:40.560
So I was just like, yeah.

28:41.360 --> 28:45.440
So it was just, oh, so fucking annoying dealing with doctors.

28:46.160 --> 28:51.280
Um, even recently, like go to my, I'll go to any doctor and they look at me.

28:51.280 --> 28:53.600
They see like, like I'm a healthy looking woman.

28:54.560 --> 28:57.040
I'm young at 56.

28:57.040 --> 29:02.960
And they're just like, wait, so you have this problem, this problem and this problem.

29:02.960 --> 29:03.760
No, you can't.

29:03.760 --> 29:04.880
You're too young.

29:06.480 --> 29:09.040
And you guys see, have seen how big my titties are.

29:09.840 --> 29:10.720
I'll be honest with you.

29:10.720 --> 29:15.840
I want a reduction because I'm having a lot of horrible back and neck and shoulder pain.

29:16.480 --> 29:21.600
That's, trust me, I love, I love my tick old bitties, but when they cause me pain,

29:21.600 --> 29:22.960
I can't deal with them.

29:22.960 --> 29:27.360
And my, one of the doctors that I went to said, you should just use a different bra.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.600
And I was like, gamer word, excuse me.

29:32.480 --> 29:32.720
No.

29:34.880 --> 29:36.240
Like, brother.

29:36.240 --> 29:37.280
No, no, no, no.

29:37.280 --> 29:43.680
What do you, maybe because it was a fucking man that told me that, but I was, I was pissed the

29:43.680 --> 29:44.480
fuck off.

29:44.480 --> 29:46.560
I was like, excuse me.

29:47.120 --> 29:49.040
You did not just fucking say that.

29:49.840 --> 29:53.360
Um, the anti-grab, yeah, they're like, just wear more sports bras.

29:53.360 --> 29:55.920
I'm like, what?

29:55.920 --> 29:57.680
That doesn't even make any fucking sense.

29:58.720 --> 30:04.880
Um, but this would, I'm like, that's on the back burner though.

30:04.880 --> 30:05.760
That's on the back burner.

30:05.760 --> 30:07.120
I don't even know what I'm talking about this.

30:08.000 --> 30:12.160
Um, I guess, yeah, it's because I've been in a lot of pain lately.

30:13.120 --> 30:16.160
Some were, I think that's another reason I had to like sleep because I've been in a

30:16.160 --> 30:17.120
lot of pain.

30:17.120 --> 30:18.640
My shoulder has been fucking killing me.

30:18.640 --> 30:21.360
So I just want to be honest with you, honest with you, tell you how I'm doing.

30:21.920 --> 30:30.000
Um, I am, you know, we are the Sick Girl Corpo, you know, point, fifth edition because

30:30.000 --> 30:31.920
every Corpo is a Sick Girl Corpo.

30:32.640 --> 30:37.360
Um, learning more, learning more about how Sheeby's body is falling apart.

30:40.720 --> 30:44.960
Um, Pac-Britters is a good name for heavy hand.

30:44.960 --> 30:47.120
That's a good, yeah, actually that's pretty good.

30:47.920 --> 30:51.360
Um, but yeah, please don't get reduction.

30:51.360 --> 30:53.200
Both men and women would kill to have those.

30:55.760 --> 30:56.960
How would I kill you?

30:59.600 --> 31:00.400
How about that?

31:00.400 --> 31:01.360
No, I'm kidding.

31:01.360 --> 31:02.640
In Minecraft, of course.

31:03.440 --> 31:12.800
Um, but you know, like imagine, I'm trying to think I'm an equivalent for men.

31:12.800 --> 31:17.920
It was funny because like Salem didn't quite understand why I wanted one either.

31:17.920 --> 31:19.120
And she's just like, come on.

31:19.120 --> 31:20.320
And I'm like, hold them.

31:20.320 --> 31:20.960
She's like, what?

31:20.960 --> 31:21.760
I'm like, hold them.

31:22.400 --> 31:23.440
So she took them and hold them.

31:23.440 --> 31:26.080
She's like, holy crap, this is like 10 pounds each.

31:26.080 --> 31:28.080
And I'm like, exactly, exactly this.

31:28.800 --> 31:34.080
Um, imagine, yeah, imagine your balls in the, no, like, I can't.

31:34.880 --> 31:45.520
Like take two things of flower, put them in a, like strap them, put a strap on each one of them,

31:45.520 --> 31:48.240
put that strap around your neck and hang yourself.

31:48.240 --> 31:48.960
No, I'm kidding.

31:48.960 --> 31:52.800
And, and hang them around your neck and you're in front of your chest.

31:52.800 --> 31:55.760
Like, or like balloons, not even, no, balloons are too light.

31:55.760 --> 32:00.880
Just like something heavy, take them, um, and do that.

32:01.600 --> 32:06.080
And then feel how bad, and then, and then wear a bra with it, like an underwire bra.

32:07.360 --> 32:10.240
Have that bra dig into you and not fit properly.

32:11.920 --> 32:12.800
Gallons of milk.

32:12.800 --> 32:14.080
Sure, whatever you want.

32:14.080 --> 32:14.560
A bowling.

32:14.560 --> 32:15.440
They're not that heavy.

32:15.440 --> 32:16.080
Jesus Christ.

32:16.720 --> 32:20.080
Um, but there you go.

32:21.600 --> 32:22.400
It's not fun.

32:22.400 --> 32:27.200
It cuts like I have permanent bruising in my shoulders and like, don't get me wrong.

32:27.760 --> 32:29.360
I don't want to do this.

32:31.680 --> 32:35.440
I would, if I didn't have to, but it just hurts.

32:35.440 --> 32:37.280
You know, it just hurts.

32:37.840 --> 32:39.040
It just hurts.

32:39.760 --> 32:41.120
It is what it is.

32:41.120 --> 32:47.360
And I was like, it also, they're not, they make me look a lot bigger than I am.

32:48.240 --> 32:56.000
And I don't know if you noticed in the pictures that I posted on, um, my alt Twitter of like my cosplay,

32:56.000 --> 33:04.400
but you could see like my tits start very high up and towards the like middle of my torso

33:05.120 --> 33:08.000
because they take up a lot of space on my body.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.080
Like, uh, I wish I could hold on.

33:12.080 --> 33:16.640
Let me see if I can find an, uh, oh, this will work.

33:20.480 --> 33:20.980
Oops.

33:21.140 --> 33:32.340
So imagine me having the body type that I do, which is very similar to she be here.

33:32.340 --> 33:35.220
I do have a bit of a tummy, but you know, I have a womb to protect.

33:35.220 --> 33:37.300
So I get a little, a little fat pouch there.

33:37.300 --> 33:38.500
I don't really care about that though.

33:38.980 --> 33:43.300
Um, so imagine my boob and it, it's like fucking this.

33:43.300 --> 33:46.020
Like when you wear a bra and then it makes me look like

33:46.020 --> 33:50.980
that, mind you, this is like anime girl.

33:50.980 --> 33:53.220
So the proportions are going to be a little bit different.

33:53.220 --> 33:56.180
My torso is shorter than my models.

34:01.220 --> 34:04.500
It, it would make me look freaking huge, right?

34:05.380 --> 34:06.980
Like it would make me look fat.

34:09.780 --> 34:15.460
And I've even noticed that because it hides my, um, my curves because I have an hourglass figure

34:15.460 --> 34:16.660
and that's what it does to them.

34:17.620 --> 34:18.420
It hides them.

34:20.820 --> 34:21.940
Obviously they're not that big.

34:21.940 --> 34:27.460
Again, the, my torso is different than my model, but like that's what it does.

34:27.460 --> 34:28.820
And so it makes it look like

34:31.940 --> 34:35.540
that I'm either fat or have huge fucking saggy titties.

34:35.540 --> 34:40.020
And I'm like, brother, give me some cute like B cups.

34:40.020 --> 34:44.980
So I can wear like, I can wear a shirt with no bra, you know, I want to have,

34:44.980 --> 34:46.580
I want to be that powerful, you know?

34:48.260 --> 34:51.620
Um, clown nose bitties, squeeze them honk.

34:52.580 --> 34:53.700
Clown girl for Jen too.

34:53.700 --> 34:54.340
Mom, please.

34:54.340 --> 34:55.380
Mom, please.

34:55.380 --> 34:56.500
Mother, please.

34:56.500 --> 34:57.220
I've been persuade.

34:57.220 --> 34:58.100
I've been suede.

34:58.100 --> 35:00.340
Slug girl, clown girl.

35:00.340 --> 35:01.300
Who else do I want?

35:01.860 --> 35:04.180
Um, I want a Lamia now.

35:04.180 --> 35:05.060
I want a bug girl.

35:08.100 --> 35:09.860
I also really want a pet play girl.

35:12.100 --> 35:12.420
Yeah.

35:13.060 --> 35:17.780
Although I already know, like several of the concepts for Jen too, but I just,

35:17.780 --> 35:22.900
a girl likes to dream, you know, there won't be a slime girl.

35:22.900 --> 35:24.340
Moths are overdone.

35:24.340 --> 35:25.540
There's like 50 moths.

35:27.540 --> 35:29.780
Um, a girl, that's a gun that we say.

35:29.780 --> 35:35.940
Honestly, there's not a lot of like, there's like Android V tubers, but like,

35:35.940 --> 35:40.580
there's not object V tubers because you'll have like food V tubers and animal V tubers,

35:41.140 --> 35:42.260
and animal V tubers.

35:42.260 --> 35:48.260
But like, honestly, like, um, like chainsaw man type, like a gun chuba.

35:49.140 --> 35:49.940
I'd be pretty sick.

35:51.620 --> 35:52.740
I wouldn't be averse to that.

35:55.620 --> 35:56.980
This game is super based.

35:57.860 --> 35:58.660
Are guns to it?

35:58.660 --> 36:00.020
Well, what do you mean?

36:00.020 --> 36:01.700
There's so many gun channels on YouTube.

36:01.700 --> 36:06.020
I watched this one guy whose name I has evaded me, but he just like,

36:06.900 --> 36:07.380
I don't know.

36:07.380 --> 36:11.700
I don't know if it's fucked up of me that I like to watch like the different types of

36:11.700 --> 36:17.300
bullets they use in different types of, I also like to see how guns work in real life versus

36:17.300 --> 36:21.220
the games that I use them with, like play them in, play them with.

36:22.260 --> 36:24.020
And oh my God, what the fuck is his name?

36:24.020 --> 36:29.540
I have to look it up and he uses like those gel bodies and he's like in the middle of

36:29.540 --> 36:32.900
like a desert and I don't know, like, I can't remember where he is at.

36:32.900 --> 36:36.420
He's like the middle, not of a desert, but it's like, it looks like Cali, but I don't

36:36.420 --> 36:37.220
think it's Cali.

36:37.780 --> 36:40.180
Um, and he just shoots it with his friends and they just

36:41.140 --> 36:43.620
are pretty, they're just, they just fuck about and it's funny.

36:43.620 --> 36:44.180
Garen Thump.

36:44.180 --> 36:44.660
Yes.

36:45.460 --> 36:45.940
Thank you.

36:47.300 --> 36:47.780
Thank you.

36:47.780 --> 36:47.940
Yeah.

36:47.940 --> 36:48.420
Garen Thump.

36:48.420 --> 36:48.660
Yep.

36:48.660 --> 36:49.540
That's him.

36:49.540 --> 36:49.780
Yeah.

36:50.500 --> 36:50.820
Yeah.

36:50.820 --> 36:51.700
That's, that's the guy.

36:53.380 --> 36:56.580
I want to get my, my, my, my license to carry.

36:56.580 --> 36:57.460
I'm not going to lie to you.

36:59.380 --> 37:01.220
Um, I've always wanted to learn how to shoot.

37:01.220 --> 37:04.820
My grandfather tried to teach me how to learn how to shoot, but then my mom said no.

37:05.700 --> 37:06.500
And I was sad.

37:07.220 --> 37:13.620
And it's funny though, because my mom has literally worked as part of her job before.

37:13.620 --> 37:23.860
She worked with a, uh, a, a team of SEALs and for some like team bonding exercise,

37:23.860 --> 37:25.940
she learned how to clear rooms and shoot.

37:25.940 --> 37:27.780
And she was like the best shooter.

37:27.780 --> 37:31.620
And one of the, my mom was telling me that one of the soldiers is like flirting with her.

37:32.420 --> 37:33.860
And saying how good of a shot she was.

37:33.940 --> 37:35.460
And she's like, he, he, he, he, he, he.

37:37.460 --> 37:44.100
And my mom's like very like, sort of scared of like, does it like violence?

37:44.100 --> 37:47.060
And I'm like, mom, be fucking for real.

37:47.060 --> 37:53.780
Like in my life, my mom probably would have been in the military or running a 14, 500 company.

37:53.780 --> 37:54.740
Cause she's that badass.

37:55.940 --> 37:58.020
Um, Spec Ops mom.

37:58.020 --> 37:58.340
Yeah.

37:58.340 --> 37:59.940
No, she's a, she's a good shot.

37:59.940 --> 38:00.420
She is.

38:01.780 --> 38:02.660
My mom's badass.

38:02.660 --> 38:06.340
I don't think my, I don't think my dad's ever shot like at a range or anything.

38:06.340 --> 38:07.220
I have to ask him.

38:08.180 --> 38:10.420
Um, I don't know if he even wears that.

38:10.420 --> 38:12.580
She V's father is some random SEAL, dude.

38:14.500 --> 38:16.020
No, this, I was around.

38:17.060 --> 38:18.740
This is not before I was born.

38:21.540 --> 38:26.820
Well, yeah, I'm, I'm also, I'm pretty good with the airsoft rifle and I'm very good at archery

38:27.700 --> 38:28.340
from camp.

38:28.340 --> 38:30.820
Um, so not to my own horn.

38:31.780 --> 38:35.060
Uh, but I do like, I do like shooting.

38:35.060 --> 38:39.940
I think it's really good way to release like pent up stress.

38:40.580 --> 38:42.980
Um, especially you're doing it in a safe environment.

38:43.540 --> 38:44.820
I would love to get lessons.

38:45.700 --> 38:49.220
Um, I do have some friends who are military.

38:49.220 --> 38:52.500
So like harem's airsoft one, that'd be fun.

38:52.500 --> 38:56.820
Oh, like a paintball off collab would be sick.

38:57.620 --> 39:00.340
Um, previous girl scout credentials.

39:01.700 --> 39:02.660
Are there any SEAL tubers?

39:02.660 --> 39:03.300
Yeah, there's a few.

39:04.340 --> 39:07.140
Oh, like I thought you meant like SEALs, like the animal.

39:07.140 --> 39:14.260
Um, no, this, I don't, there's the only military related person I can think of as the horse.

39:14.900 --> 39:17.380
Uh, is it Tomoe or Tomo?

39:18.020 --> 39:19.060
She's like a horse girl.

39:19.940 --> 39:23.620
Um, and there's definitely, there's not a lot of military oriented.

39:24.260 --> 39:29.380
Like they'll have like old school, general artwork of them, but they're not like actually

39:29.460 --> 39:30.820
like military base.

39:30.820 --> 39:32.420
You know, there's a, there's a niche there.

39:33.140 --> 39:36.740
There's a niche there at some airsoft stuff to throw.

39:36.740 --> 39:38.100
No, where am I going to use it?

39:38.100 --> 39:39.700
I don't, there's no ranges near me.

39:39.700 --> 39:40.420
Umari Tomo.

39:40.420 --> 39:40.660
Yes.

39:40.660 --> 39:41.380
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

39:41.380 --> 39:41.860
Yes, sir.

39:41.860 --> 39:42.340
She's cool.

39:42.980 --> 39:45.540
Um, I love her, her character's design.

39:46.580 --> 39:49.620
Um, close enough.

39:49.620 --> 39:52.020
Well, I can't pretty guys know, I can't pronounce Japanese names.

39:53.220 --> 39:54.500
Uh, a few tactical VTubers.

39:54.500 --> 39:58.340
And then I don't know where VSPO EN is.

39:58.340 --> 39:59.700
I always call them vispo.

39:59.700 --> 40:02.020
Um, like where are they?

40:02.020 --> 40:02.740
Where are they?

40:03.300 --> 40:04.260
Where's their gen?

40:04.260 --> 40:05.460
Where's the EN gen?

40:07.380 --> 40:09.540
I applied for that a year ago.

40:10.500 --> 40:16.100
They gave me a few views, but of course you sell.

40:16.100 --> 40:17.540
I didn't get a call back.

40:17.540 --> 40:19.460
I'm happy I didn't be alert.

40:20.020 --> 40:24.420
Um, because again, I told you guys I used to do a lot of, uh, FPS games.

40:24.500 --> 40:26.020
So I thought I could make it in.

40:26.020 --> 40:28.900
And this is even before I became a VTuber,

40:28.900 --> 40:30.580
like before I even was Rena.

40:30.580 --> 40:34.740
So I just applied as myself, just normal me.

40:36.100 --> 40:38.100
Um, what gun did I shoot before?

40:38.100 --> 40:38.820
I don't know.

40:40.180 --> 40:41.540
I remember I shot a rifle.

40:43.140 --> 40:46.340
Uh, it was like a type of rifle.

40:46.340 --> 40:46.740
I don't know.

40:46.740 --> 40:47.700
I can't remember that shit.

40:48.660 --> 40:52.580
Just because I watch gun stuff doesn't mean I know what everything's about.

40:55.460 --> 40:58.740
The SPO has the highest standards in industry because you have to be good at it.

40:58.740 --> 41:02.340
But they're like, but then again, like think about who owns the SPO.

41:02.980 --> 41:04.580
Or I was calling VISPO because it's fun.

41:05.460 --> 41:06.580
Owns VESPA.

41:06.580 --> 41:07.220
VISPO.

41:07.220 --> 41:08.340
Um, Brave Group.

41:08.900 --> 41:13.620
And Brave Group has already seen how successful that, um,

41:15.140 --> 41:20.420
before Mariah and Globi are in their normal gens.

41:20.420 --> 41:22.100
And I think I'm missing one, but I forget.

41:22.660 --> 41:26.500
Um, there are a lot of FPS girls, girlies.

41:27.060 --> 41:27.620
I don't know.

41:27.620 --> 41:28.980
I'm like, maybe they're being trained.

41:28.980 --> 41:32.180
Maybe they're, maybe they scrapped the project and focused on V for Mariah.

41:32.180 --> 41:32.660
I don't know.

41:32.660 --> 41:33.220
I don't know.

41:37.220 --> 41:42.420
But, and I know like they want to do competitive gaming as well.

41:42.420 --> 41:45.700
So, oh, thank you, boy, for the 10 gifted.

41:45.700 --> 41:47.620
Oh, thank you very much.

41:47.620 --> 41:48.340
Appreciate it.

41:49.460 --> 41:50.260
You rise up.

41:50.580 --> 41:52.420
But, um, yeah, sometimes.

41:52.420 --> 41:57.140
And then actually, can we, can we just like talk about like VTubing stuff for a second?

41:57.780 --> 42:04.900
Like, I'm not a, I'm someone who's very interested in the comings and goings of the

42:04.900 --> 42:08.900
VTubing industry and community stuff.

42:10.100 --> 42:19.220
And I tweeted yesterday as a joke, um, that I'm like, I'm going to hijack TVS.

42:19.620 --> 42:20.100
Okay.

42:20.100 --> 42:24.340
Things that VTubers say run by a false ID, uh, because he hasn't been covering small

42:24.340 --> 42:31.620
Corpo stuff and only like needy shit and someone called like someone fucking tagged

42:31.620 --> 42:37.540
him in it like he liked the tweet and I was like, lol, I was kidding.

42:37.540 --> 42:38.980
Cause I'm going to make my own.

42:40.020 --> 42:42.580
I like, I definitely want to make some of you.

42:42.580 --> 42:45.220
I used to be a commentator, YouTuber.

42:45.220 --> 42:53.140
Um, and I would like to do an unbiased, uh, what's it called, just like segment, not like

42:53.140 --> 42:59.780
too long, just talking about smaller agency news, cause that's been sorely lacking for

42:59.780 --> 43:01.300
the last little bit.

43:01.300 --> 43:04.180
Um, so I feel like that would be fun.

43:05.380 --> 43:06.580
Damn, you done it all.

43:06.580 --> 43:07.220
Yeah.

43:07.220 --> 43:10.340
Again, you guys, I said it before, I used to work for VTubing.

43:10.340 --> 43:13.140
Um, I, this wouldn't be drama based.

43:13.140 --> 43:18.660
I wouldn't, I would probably, uh, and I would also like look to you guys as like a resource.

43:18.660 --> 43:23.140
I'm smacking my headphones, um, to like be like, oh, what do you think I should talk

43:23.140 --> 43:23.700
about?

43:23.700 --> 43:28.260
Or like maybe make him into shorts, um, just but like only focus on agency VTubers.

43:28.260 --> 43:29.540
Cause I think that would be fun.

43:29.540 --> 43:31.780
Um, and Shawnee was like, hell yeah.

43:31.780 --> 43:33.060
And I was like, yeah.

43:33.060 --> 43:35.460
And then Shawnee's been supporting a lot of my ideas lately.

43:35.460 --> 43:40.260
And I'm like, yeah, I'm going to be like, I'm going to be like, I'm going to be like,

43:40.740 --> 43:43.700
so I want to like think of a name and stuff and get that ball rolling.

43:43.700 --> 43:48.260
I've been thinking about it before like back when I was Renna that I would do something

43:48.260 --> 43:54.500
like that, um, but I would cover like all news, but as an indie, but now being agency,

43:54.500 --> 43:58.180
I would rather just want to cover other like my agency and other agencies.

43:58.660 --> 44:01.220
Um, I know that might be a conflict of interest.

44:01.220 --> 44:02.260
I get that.

44:02.260 --> 44:07.140
Um, but I would probably only like objectively just say like, hey, this is what's going on.

44:07.140 --> 44:09.860
I'm not injecting feeling into it.

44:09.860 --> 44:13.460
Um, so be sucky VTuber news.

44:13.460 --> 44:15.220
Uh, should be news.

44:15.220 --> 44:16.340
Yeah, if you count me in.

44:16.340 --> 44:17.940
I'm going to have this TV, yeah.

44:17.940 --> 44:22.020
Um, actually, I was very thankful he didn't cover us because I think we've got,

44:22.020 --> 44:22.980
we've gotten more hate.

44:22.980 --> 44:32.340
Um, I've said before that when him and other VTubers first covered us debuting or being

44:32.340 --> 44:36.980
created in any mention of it, uh, they focused more in the negative comments

44:37.540 --> 44:40.420
or assumptions of the company.

44:40.900 --> 44:46.100
Um, and I feel like they might do the same if they covered us again, although because

44:46.100 --> 44:47.620
he liked my tweet, I'm kind of worried.

44:47.620 --> 44:49.780
I'm just like, oh, fuck, is he going to cover us for the next one?

44:49.780 --> 44:50.500
So who knows?

44:51.060 --> 44:56.500
Um, but whatever the fucking hat, no, it is what it is rabbit hole news.

44:57.940 --> 44:58.500
Are you funny?

45:00.020 --> 45:01.060
Um, but yeah.

45:01.060 --> 45:06.580
And then I'm like, I can like, I can't do, I have to make drama to get on, but that's not

45:06.660 --> 45:07.220
my goal.

45:07.220 --> 45:10.580
I don't want to, I don't like drama.

45:10.580 --> 45:17.380
I don't, um, I would, you could ask anybody that I'm friends with, uh, in the girls.

45:17.380 --> 45:23.940
Like I'm someone who if I hear anything like whispers of unrest, I'm like, let's get to

45:23.940 --> 45:24.500
the bottom of it.

45:24.500 --> 45:25.700
Let's talk, let's do this.

45:25.700 --> 45:26.260
What's going on?

45:26.260 --> 45:29.300
Not that that hasn't even happened, but they just know I'm that type of person.

45:29.860 --> 45:32.980
Um, there's not such a thing as bad publicity.

45:37.540 --> 45:49.060
I think there is for our case, just because of the content we do, uh, I don't know.

45:49.060 --> 45:55.860
Like I just feel like for us would be more of a detriment to our brand, but, and then

45:55.860 --> 45:58.100
just show how unprofessional we are.

45:58.100 --> 46:04.180
If I like, if we got into any sort of that stuff, um, sure drama alert girl.

46:04.980 --> 46:06.900
Um, haters gonna hate.

46:07.620 --> 46:07.940
Yeah.

46:07.940 --> 46:11.300
And it's like, and it's bad if it messes with your mental health.

46:11.300 --> 46:11.700
Yes.

46:11.700 --> 46:16.260
I wouldn't want to, I'm like, I'm here to talk about what's happened.

46:16.260 --> 46:20.900
I don't want to talk about how these two girls are bitching at each other because this,

46:20.900 --> 46:21.860
this and that happened.

46:22.500 --> 46:25.700
I'm going to say, yeah, I'm not, I don't care about that stuff.

46:28.980 --> 46:31.780
It is disappointing when there's really never any updates on something that does

46:31.780 --> 46:32.500
is negative.

46:32.500 --> 46:33.380
Yeah, it is.

46:33.380 --> 46:41.060
It's kind of a let down, uh, cause like I'm always someone who I'm like, celebrate the

46:41.060 --> 46:41.940
little victories.

46:42.260 --> 46:49.140
Um, and lately, anytime I look at something VTuber news related or VTuber related, um,

46:49.140 --> 46:53.220
or like coverage of it, it's usually something negative and it makes me sad because there's

46:53.220 --> 46:57.860
a bunch of like good things happening in the community every day.

46:58.500 --> 47:06.260
Um, but then again, like that's not, the news doesn't report like the regular news doesn't

47:06.260 --> 47:09.220
report unhappy things anymore either.

47:09.220 --> 47:13.860
I don't even watch news, like actual like human news anymore because they don't report

47:13.860 --> 47:14.740
on anything.

47:14.740 --> 47:19.380
Like it's usually like tragedy or like something bad or the weather.

47:21.380 --> 47:27.540
Um, so, and then I totally get why he would do that because Nidhi was up his ass.

47:27.540 --> 47:28.900
He's like, let me go up his ass.

47:28.900 --> 47:29.780
Let me go up their ass.

47:29.780 --> 47:30.740
And I'm like, you know what?

47:30.740 --> 47:31.220
I got it.

47:31.780 --> 47:37.620
Um, but I liked to watch it when I was an indie so I could see what like kind of what

47:37.620 --> 47:39.700
the tone was for agencies.

47:40.340 --> 47:46.180
Um, and also like what indies were doing in the, in the VTuber community because I just,

47:46.180 --> 47:50.260
I want to know everybody was up to, um, now I just don't watch any of it at all.

47:52.100 --> 47:53.060
I just listened.

47:53.060 --> 47:56.820
I like to listen to like video essays now about like things that have happened in the

47:56.820 --> 47:57.220
past.

47:57.780 --> 48:02.580
Um, I think that's interesting because I like to educate myself on VTuber history because

48:02.580 --> 48:04.820
again, I've only been a VTuber for six months.

48:04.820 --> 48:11.620
I've known and been part of the community and a consumer of VTubers since they, um,

48:12.580 --> 48:18.660
since they've been around, um, since they started back like before in like 2019 or even

48:18.660 --> 48:19.700
further than that.

48:19.700 --> 48:24.900
But I never was like in it in it, you know, VTuber weather segment.

48:24.900 --> 48:26.100
It'd be really funny.

48:26.100 --> 48:27.380
I'm out in a weather segment.

48:27.380 --> 48:37.060
I would just make makeup like random fake places and be like, it's currently sunny in

48:37.060 --> 48:37.940
Topeka.

48:37.940 --> 48:38.500
What is it?

48:38.500 --> 48:39.940
It's raining in Topeka.

48:39.940 --> 48:41.860
It was something like foster's home for measuring friends.

48:42.740 --> 48:46.740
Um, hop, happy, hoppy news tonight at 8 p.m.

48:48.100 --> 48:50.180
Happy, hoppy news tonight at 8 p.m.

48:50.180 --> 48:51.700
With your hottie host, Sheebie.

48:52.340 --> 48:58.020
I'd have to work on my transatlantic accent because I can't, um, it's, it would be hard to

48:59.220 --> 49:01.140
because I need to do like the news voice.

49:04.260 --> 49:06.980
And tonight we're expecting a light drizzle in Wonderland.

49:10.180 --> 49:11.700
Later tonight at 6 p.m.

49:12.820 --> 49:14.820
What is strongy shoving up her ass?

49:22.660 --> 49:23.460
Oh my God.

49:25.220 --> 49:26.020
Where are my mods?

49:27.540 --> 49:28.100
They're gone.

49:28.100 --> 49:29.220
They're like, she's late an hour.

49:29.220 --> 49:29.860
I can't do it.

49:32.580 --> 49:33.860
I'll do it myself.

49:35.060 --> 49:36.580
I'll do it myself.

49:41.780 --> 49:44.580
Tomorrow, it's going to be raining urine.

49:44.580 --> 49:47.300
So make sure you have your umbrellas or open your mouth.

49:48.340 --> 49:50.820
Um, sometimes I sound like I'm from a commercial and I do that.

49:50.900 --> 49:52.340
Strongy catching strings.

49:55.780 --> 50:01.220
Hey guys, can we not, can we stop talking about my investor in the chat?

50:01.220 --> 50:01.860
Thank you.

50:01.860 --> 50:02.420
Kisses.

50:03.700 --> 50:08.660
Unnecessary speculation going on about where people are from, which is,

50:09.460 --> 50:11.780
you don't need to know because it doesn't matter.

50:11.780 --> 50:12.820
Just enjoy their content.

50:13.700 --> 50:17.060
Um, that's a meme if I ever heard it.

50:17.780 --> 50:23.620
The rabbit's foot segment goes, and it's just me stepping like just like heel clacking noises.

50:25.220 --> 50:25.940
That'd be funny.

50:28.020 --> 50:32.420
There is an Aurora Borealis localized entirely in Icy's kitchen.

50:32.420 --> 50:33.620
How is she doing it?

50:36.580 --> 50:41.860
Tonight at BunnyBun capacity, what's going into she being and how much?

50:47.060 --> 50:50.500
That was good.

50:50.500 --> 50:51.460
That was, that was good.

50:51.460 --> 50:52.580
I'll give you that.

50:52.580 --> 50:53.380
I'll give you that.

50:57.860 --> 50:58.340
Okay.

50:58.340 --> 50:59.220
Need a quick look back.

51:00.500 --> 51:08.820
Oh, but, but, and then like also like, um, I would just, I just like to talk about VTubers.

51:08.820 --> 51:09.780
Like it was cool.

51:09.780 --> 51:15.060
I'm very excited to see the debuts for the new EN girls from Hall of Live.

51:15.060 --> 51:19.780
I didn't anticipate for them, for there to be a new gen so soon.

51:19.780 --> 51:21.620
I thought it was going to be a couple more months.

51:22.660 --> 51:27.060
Um, although everybody had kind of already surmised who was going to be who, but you know,

51:27.060 --> 51:28.260
like training and all that.

51:28.260 --> 51:33.220
And I'm wondering if they were hired on or scouted previously because models don't

51:33.220 --> 51:37.220
take a very long time to make unless they cranked them out because I know they have in-house people.

51:38.020 --> 51:40.980
And they have obviously being Hall of Live have pulled in the industry.

51:40.980 --> 51:45.860
But, um, uh, Raora Panthera, I can't pronounce anybody's names.

51:45.860 --> 51:46.660
Please don't hurt me.

51:46.660 --> 51:48.500
Raora Panthera, I love her design.

51:49.540 --> 51:52.180
I love her concept is so true to her.

51:52.180 --> 51:55.300
If you know who she is, uh, being an amazing artist and everything.

51:56.020 --> 51:58.100
I really like the short stack.

51:58.980 --> 52:01.460
Um, I feel like she'll be really silly.

52:02.500 --> 52:08.660
And then I feel like Blood Flame, Elizabeth Rose Blood Flame is just

52:09.220 --> 52:11.220
Narissa Red.

52:13.300 --> 52:14.420
Narissa in red.

52:14.980 --> 52:18.980
Um, so, but I like, I, everybody's, and then I was

52:18.980 --> 52:22.340
chuckling at the automaton's last name, Immigrate.

52:24.260 --> 52:27.540
And then I'm like, she kind of looks like mint, but they look amazing.

52:27.540 --> 52:28.100
They look amazing.

52:28.100 --> 52:31.540
Like, and she probably does plays violin or does some sort of music.

52:31.540 --> 52:36.900
And so I can't wait to see the type of talents they'll possess and everything.

52:36.900 --> 52:38.500
And just like, how fun they'll be.

52:39.060 --> 52:43.140
I usually, I usually don't watch, um, Hollow Live or Niji just because

52:43.780 --> 52:45.140
I don't want to fall in love again.

52:46.020 --> 52:46.820
She worry.

52:46.820 --> 52:53.300
Um, but, uh, it's, and it's also hard because you don't get the intimacy of a smaller

52:53.300 --> 52:54.260
streamer in chat.

52:54.260 --> 52:55.860
That's why I like smaller agencies.

52:55.860 --> 52:58.100
And that's why my Oshi is in the smaller agency.

52:58.660 --> 53:01.460
Um, so it's, yeah.

53:02.020 --> 53:02.520
Yeah.

53:04.020 --> 53:06.180
Trony does give us this Scorches style.

53:07.140 --> 53:08.820
Yeah, my favorite is Rod Bunny is live.

53:08.820 --> 53:09.220
How's it going?

53:09.220 --> 53:10.180
We're going, we're doing all that.

53:10.180 --> 53:10.680
Okay.

53:11.780 --> 53:12.660
I'm agreeing.

53:12.660 --> 53:13.700
Sounds like an intro.

53:16.420 --> 53:17.220
Irma Gurd.

53:18.580 --> 53:20.500
Everybody sounds like Irma Gurd names.

53:20.500 --> 53:21.540
Yeah, that's true.

53:21.540 --> 53:22.180
That's funny.

53:22.900 --> 53:27.700
Um, yeah, just, it's, it's, it just stay, and you can usually only

53:27.700 --> 53:30.500
communicate through like, text-to-speech donations.

53:31.060 --> 53:33.860
Um, which is funny because it makes for amazing clips and everything.

53:33.860 --> 53:37.460
And people write some really funny shit, but like, I like this.

53:37.460 --> 53:38.180
I can read chat.

53:38.740 --> 53:42.420
I honestly probably know all of you.

53:42.420 --> 53:46.340
It's like, right now I don't really see a lot of unfamiliar faces.

53:46.340 --> 53:47.700
So I have my regulars.

53:47.700 --> 53:51.700
And so it's very nice to have a closer intimate fan base.

53:51.700 --> 53:52.740
Who is my Oshi?

53:52.740 --> 53:53.620
You don't need to know.

53:54.180 --> 53:56.740
That's for me to know and you to never to find out.

53:56.740 --> 53:57.460
She's mine.

53:57.460 --> 53:58.740
I'm gatekeeping her.

53:58.740 --> 53:59.460
Okay.

53:59.460 --> 53:59.940
Thank you.

54:00.820 --> 54:04.420
Um, model actually is a violin, plays a bassoon, calling it now.

54:04.420 --> 54:05.620
I bet she's multi-talented.

54:05.620 --> 54:07.300
I bet she can like, play piano and stuff.

54:07.860 --> 54:09.060
Um, name a salt.

54:09.060 --> 54:11.060
Well, I'm not going to read your names right now.

54:11.060 --> 54:12.820
Oh wait, I see a new name.

54:12.820 --> 54:14.020
You must be a lurker.

54:16.500 --> 54:17.460
But thank you guys.

54:17.460 --> 54:22.340
If you're new and you remembered, um, I am, I do recognize a lot of you,

54:22.340 --> 54:24.260
but so don't think I don't know who you are.

54:24.260 --> 54:25.780
I appreciate all of you.

54:26.340 --> 54:27.620
Especially my lurkers.

54:27.620 --> 54:29.940
Because even though you don't talk, you're still watching.

54:29.940 --> 54:31.380
You still got me in the background.

54:31.380 --> 54:32.900
And I care about you for that.

54:32.900 --> 54:33.780
Thank you.

54:33.780 --> 54:36.340
Um, she remembers.

54:44.020 --> 54:45.380
Um, I do be lurking though.

54:45.380 --> 54:46.340
Yeah, that's fine.

54:46.340 --> 54:46.820
I lurk.

54:46.820 --> 54:48.580
I, I don't talk.

54:49.780 --> 54:50.980
Wind streams.

54:50.980 --> 54:53.700
Um, because like, I have like a whole alt account.

54:54.260 --> 54:56.820
Like, not, not even like Rena.

54:57.220 --> 55:02.260
Um, like I have like my own personal account that I like, I watch VTubers on.

55:02.260 --> 55:02.900
And I just lurk.

55:02.900 --> 55:03.700
I don't say anything.

55:04.180 --> 55:08.340
Um, and like, yeah, I'm trying to think.

55:08.340 --> 55:12.180
I think I only, the only time I ever talked was when Strawny,

55:12.180 --> 55:13.780
Strawny was someplace else.

55:15.220 --> 55:18.500
And that's, and like, that's how you like, I don't talk in streams.

55:18.500 --> 55:20.660
And then she got me to want to talk in streams.

55:20.660 --> 55:21.700
That's how amazing she is.

55:22.660 --> 55:27.140
Yeah, and I usually have streams in the background too for background noise.

55:27.140 --> 55:29.860
I know a lot of you guys do that or like, and because I know sometimes I stream

55:29.860 --> 55:30.660
when people are working.

55:31.940 --> 55:35.780
Um, so yeah, speaking of streaming, I haven't started the game yet,

55:35.780 --> 55:38.420
but I kind of feel like yapping because this is going to be a long stream.

55:38.420 --> 55:45.700
Um, I'm, maybe this will be an endurance stream, uh, just because, um, I love this game.

55:46.980 --> 55:48.500
And I love spending time with you guys.

55:48.500 --> 55:50.820
Um, I'm just ashamed of my green name status.

55:50.820 --> 55:52.580
That's why I lurk.

55:56.580 --> 55:58.420
Oh, yeah, hide yourself.

55:58.420 --> 55:59.380
I don't show your face.

55:59.380 --> 56:01.940
Gray name, terrible.

56:01.940 --> 56:02.980
No, I'm kidding.

56:02.980 --> 56:17.540
Um, but, uh, even if you're not green and your name is gray, don't think I don't appreciate you.

56:17.780 --> 56:20.180
Um, I just appreciate you less now.

56:22.660 --> 56:24.900
Ow, hurt my rib laughing like that.

56:25.700 --> 56:30.020
Um, also, um, Immi, I think is going live right now.

56:30.020 --> 56:32.820
So if you wanted to go see Immi, uh, I forget what she's playing,

56:32.820 --> 56:34.100
but you can go check her out.

56:34.740 --> 56:38.260
Um, her, her info is in my description as well.

56:38.900 --> 56:41.540
Um, what build do you tend to go for?

56:41.540 --> 56:43.140
I kind of just wing it every run.

56:44.100 --> 56:46.260
I used to abuse the Orborus.

56:46.260 --> 56:48.660
Oh, thank you for the 10 gifted authority.

56:48.660 --> 56:49.060
Thank you.

56:49.860 --> 56:50.580
Appreciate it.

56:50.580 --> 56:52.900
Speaking of which, I don't know if anybody, I don't have my headphones on,

56:52.900 --> 56:54.740
so I can't hear if somebody like don't know.

56:55.300 --> 56:55.860
Let me look.

56:57.860 --> 57:00.020
I need, I'm, I might get IEMs.

57:00.740 --> 57:05.620
Um, what do I mean?

57:05.620 --> 57:09.300
I remember what they're called, but like the essentially earbuds,

57:09.300 --> 57:13.300
just because headphones with my glasses on hurt my ears.

57:13.940 --> 57:16.420
They're the ones that these are in ear monitors.

57:16.420 --> 57:16.660
Yeah.

57:19.220 --> 57:20.260
Um,

57:20.260 --> 57:23.460
You just get more spit from Georgia Tech U.

57:25.460 --> 57:30.020
Um, but no, like if you show up, that's all that matters to me.

57:30.580 --> 57:37.540
Um, I also decided because I'm starting to think it's causing

57:37.540 --> 57:40.260
somewhere divide between everybody's fan bases.

57:40.820 --> 57:43.860
I don't mind if you have somebody else's Oshimarks in your name.

57:45.300 --> 57:50.340
I was doing it for Kayfabe, um, but I'm realizing I don't like,

57:51.300 --> 57:55.780
like I'm pretending to be mad because you like somebody else.

57:55.780 --> 58:01.700
It's you can like multiple streamers, especially ones in our gen.

58:02.420 --> 58:06.500
Um, and yeah, I just

58:07.860 --> 58:08.340
I don't know.

58:10.980 --> 58:13.620
I've been here since be a lure first form on Twitter.

58:13.620 --> 58:15.220
I feel like an old woman.

58:15.220 --> 58:18.180
Can't wait to see you all grow and have the privilege of looking back on these streams.

58:18.180 --> 58:19.860
Oh, yeah.

58:19.860 --> 58:21.940
It's, I've been there since the beginning too.

58:21.940 --> 58:23.140
So I'm right there with you, sis.

58:25.860 --> 58:27.140
I can't see a new she beat.

58:27.140 --> 58:28.260
It's for me, not you.

58:28.820 --> 58:29.860
Keep it in the family.

58:29.860 --> 58:30.260
Yeah.

58:30.260 --> 58:31.300
Keep it in the family.

58:31.300 --> 58:32.100
That's how what I'll say.

58:32.100 --> 58:33.380
You can keep it in the family.

58:34.340 --> 58:36.260
Although like, but it's funny because I'll like,

58:36.260 --> 58:37.700
I'll see other people's Oh, she marks.

58:37.700 --> 58:41.060
Like I think I saw like a Maya whispers and like she's a, oh my God,

58:42.100 --> 58:47.060
a giant fucking June bug just landed on my window and scared the shit out of me.

58:47.060 --> 58:47.540
Holy crap.

58:47.540 --> 58:48.180
The thing is huge.

58:48.660 --> 58:51.140
Um, staring at me.

58:51.780 --> 58:53.140
But like, I like a Maya whisper.

58:53.140 --> 58:55.620
She's a good, you know, as martyrs and stuff.

58:55.620 --> 58:56.740
So I'm like, I don't really care.

58:58.180 --> 59:04.340
Um, I just like, I just, I'm a type of person and I think that's why me and

59:04.340 --> 59:06.660
strongy are so much alike that I'm like, just support everybody.

59:07.300 --> 59:09.300
If you can do what you can.

59:09.860 --> 59:13.460
If you want, cause you know, everybody's so talented.

59:16.020 --> 59:16.740
Everybody's so cool.

59:16.740 --> 59:18.900
Cause like, I love a lot of the other agency girls.

59:18.900 --> 59:20.020
Again, I used to be indie.

59:20.020 --> 59:28.100
I followed and looked up to a lot of the people that are, yeah, but so I'm like, I can't be like,

59:28.100 --> 59:30.100
Oh my God, don't hate me.

59:30.660 --> 59:32.020
Don't, don't, don't stop.

59:32.580 --> 59:33.380
Can't love.

59:33.380 --> 59:34.340
You have to love me more.

59:35.380 --> 59:39.140
I just want you to love me more or less.

59:41.060 --> 59:48.740
Um, and I think, yeah, I think, I think it's a healthier mentality for me.

59:48.740 --> 59:50.340
Cause I do, I, I'll be honest with you.

59:50.340 --> 59:56.660
I do get jealous and I realize feeding into that mindset for me for kayfabe is,

59:56.660 --> 59:58.020
is actually not good for me.

59:58.660 --> 01:00:07.060
Um, cause I remember back when I was Rina, I would feel immense jealousy when something happens.

01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:11.460
And now I'm just like, no, I've kind of grown from that.

01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:18.740
Um, cause I'm just like, why am I upset that somebody else is supporting a streamer that I also enjoy?

01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:21.780
I'm like, fuck that.

01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:23.460
No, like that's, no.

01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:30.180
But, um, again, and another thing, cause I was asking Mercy to explain it to me.

01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:35.140
Um, because I know she, she, uh, she gets bothered by stuff.

01:00:35.140 --> 01:00:40.340
Um, so she was explaining to, I smacked my mic, explaining to me like, oh, she culture,

01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:43.620
like, and what, how, what oh, she's mean and commie.

01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:48.340
Not that I didn't know already, but just like on a deeper level, like really picking it apart

01:00:48.340 --> 01:00:50.500
and like telling me, so I really appreciated her to do that.

01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:51.380
Cause then I understand.

01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:53.940
I'm like, oh, I got it.

01:00:53.940 --> 01:00:54.660
I understand.

01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:55.140
I get it.

01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:56.340
Like not this.

01:00:56.340 --> 01:00:57.460
Thank you for explaining it to me.

01:00:58.020 --> 01:01:00.820
Um, don't want to put sugar in chat.

01:01:00.820 --> 01:01:07.380
I do, again, I, again, I do, if you, I do want you to be collared to me, but I can't force you to do that.

01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:12.900
Um, there's just she be only she be, and I've also kind of just decided and then like,

01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:16.500
cause I was talking to a straw knee and one of the managers about it too.

01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:31.620
Um, I think I put too much effort in stock into a kayfabe, um, which is my kayfabe is,

01:01:31.620 --> 01:01:33.780
you know, dummy mommy mistress.

01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:35.140
Oh, I'm going to step on you.

01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:45.300
When the reason I was hired was because of my voice and my personality.

01:01:46.260 --> 01:01:52.420
I wasn't, it's not like I'm acting and cast to play an actual character.

01:01:52.420 --> 01:01:53.700
That's not what V tubing is.

01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:58.900
Uh, it's like who's line is it anyway?

01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:00.100
Where the points don't matter.

01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:03.780
The kayfabe barely fucking matters only for like assets.

01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:06.820
A little bit of backstory for your appearance, vice versa.

01:02:07.460 --> 01:02:12.260
Um, kayfabe, if you don't know is a wrestling term, which is like your lore, your backstory,

01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:14.660
your history of their character that you play.

01:02:15.220 --> 01:02:21.380
Um, and I was just, and this might filter some people and that's fine.

01:02:21.380 --> 01:02:27.460
And I was talking to strongy and one of the managers about it and I was just like, I had,

01:02:27.460 --> 01:02:32.740
I said to her, I'm like, I realized the other day because I was having so much imposter syndrome

01:02:32.740 --> 01:02:36.820
because I was like getting so worked up that I wasn't good enough to be she be.

01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:40.580
And then strong is like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, shut up.

01:02:40.580 --> 01:02:43.940
Like you were always meant to be she be you were my she be.

01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:48.260
I didn't pick you because you could be a dummy mommy because I wasn't.

01:02:48.260 --> 01:02:55.540
If you guys don't know who I was, I was Rina who was a fucking lolly sub bitch brown cat.

01:02:55.540 --> 01:02:57.700
Like I'm total opposite of me.

01:02:57.700 --> 01:02:58.900
She's like, I picked you for you.

01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:00.820
And I'm like, you know what?

01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:01.700
And that goes for the other girls.

01:03:01.700 --> 01:03:04.900
She picked us for us, not the characters we play.

01:03:08.420 --> 01:03:11.140
But like I enjoy playing into the dummy mommy.

01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:14.180
Like don't don't get me wrong.

01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:15.380
I do like doing that.

01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:20.180
Um, because I do like, you know, getting you guys little riles up.

01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:27.220
Oh, um, and I was just like, you know what?

01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:27.780
You're fucking right.

01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:34.020
I'm not going to have imposter syndrome anymore because she picked me out of hundreds of other

01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:36.660
people just because I'm a goofy motherfucker.

01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:36.980
Okay.

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:39.220
She watched, she sat down and watched my streams.

01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:45.300
The team that she hired also like she selected me and then she went to the team was like,

01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:46.100
what do you guys think?

01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:47.380
And they're like, oh yeah, 100%.

01:03:47.380 --> 01:03:48.260
She's our first choice.

01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:53.540
So at the end of the day, I'm just going to be me.

01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:55.380
You'll get dumb.

01:03:55.380 --> 01:03:56.260
You'll get girl fail.

01:03:56.260 --> 01:03:56.740
You'll get this.

01:03:56.740 --> 01:03:57.220
You get that.

01:03:57.860 --> 01:04:00.420
Um, and that's made me feel so much more better.

01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:01.780
Just real.

01:04:01.780 --> 01:04:07.540
I'm like, and it's funny because nobody fucking cares about kayfabe in the VTuber community,

01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:08.660
except lately for us.

01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:12.180
I'm like, nobody usually cares about fucking lore.

01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:14.740
But suddenly everybody cares about us.

01:04:14.740 --> 01:04:16.260
Stick it to our fucking lore.

01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:17.540
You can't see.

01:04:17.540 --> 01:04:19.780
I'm shaking my hands, leaning back.

01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:28.340
Um, and yeah, I'm like, I'm just, and I'm not saying this because like I'm angry or anything.

01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:30.900
I'm just saying this because like I've come to the realization.

01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:37.700
Like I, I'm becoming more comfortable being she be like, I feel like she's me now

01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:40.260
because I'm acting as myself.

01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:43.220
I'm not pretending to be someone I'm not because then you just get burnt out and you

01:04:43.220 --> 01:04:44.260
just get unhappy.

01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:48.500
And that's where a lot of VTubers crash and burn is because they think they have to

01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:51.940
play an actual character when in fact they were just hired for their voice

01:04:52.660 --> 01:04:57.380
and for who they were in their content prior to being cast.

01:04:58.180 --> 01:05:03.780
Um, but yeah, uh, also new.

01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:04.900
Yeah, I'm new.

01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:08.020
Like, don't forget that I haven't finished VTuber for long.

01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:18.420
Um, for ABVTubers, it's not kfave, it's anti-tax, which are on my Patreon.

01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:20.740
Like you still get that stuff on my Patreon.

01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:30.340
Um, yeah, I think everybody shouldn't care that much about stuff because like, look at

01:05:30.340 --> 01:05:32.020
Icy, she's supposed to be a brat.

01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:33.380
She's so cute and sweet.

01:05:33.380 --> 01:05:34.100
That's fine.

01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:37.860
And then look at Amy, she was supposed to be the sweet and cute one and she's a brat.

01:05:38.180 --> 01:05:38.900
And that's great.

01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:47.700
And then Azura is, you know, she's like quirky, funny, um, giggly little goat.

01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:51.220
And she's not like, oh, my sweet little boy all the time.

01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:51.860
That's fine.

01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:54.980
And then like, you know, strongy is strongy.

01:05:54.980 --> 01:05:56.420
And then Mercy's Mercy.

01:05:56.420 --> 01:06:00.340
And like you guys fall in love with us because of us, not because of the,

01:06:01.940 --> 01:06:04.900
because of our pat, like our fake kfave, you know?

01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:08.340
And yeah, it's great.

01:06:08.340 --> 01:06:14.100
Like it's not even Gap Moe, like, because it doesn't matter that much because we were

01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:15.060
meant to be these people.

01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:16.980
Azura is also a brat.

01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:18.180
Ooh, I didn't know that.

01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:20.980
Like, oh yeah, we're, we're a wacky little gang.

01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:23.460
I'm just a funky little rabbit.

01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:27.540
Um, yeah.

01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:29.380
And the chemistry is authentic.

01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:32.100
Um, bad of anatomy.

01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:34.740
I added to my schedule next week a drawing stream.

01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:36.740
So I hope you guys will enjoy that.

01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:40.580
Um, yes.

01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:47.700
And it's like, I don't have to be that.

01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:52.500
That's, that's in the other content that's in the Patreon.

01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:59.540
And I don't want you guys to put so much pressure on yourselves or the girls to be

01:06:59.540 --> 01:07:03.220
like, oh, like, I know a lot of people don't watch me because they're like, oh,

01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:04.740
I'm not into hard fandom.

01:07:05.940 --> 01:07:09.940
But I'm like, I'm not doming the chat 24 seven.

01:07:09.940 --> 01:07:16.660
Like that's not like, give everybody a chance because I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.

01:07:16.660 --> 01:07:21.540
Like you probably are watching me right now saying, oh, I don't think I'd like one of the

01:07:21.540 --> 01:07:24.020
smaller girls because I like big jugs.

01:07:24.980 --> 01:07:29.060
Um, yeah, but like, Amy's funny as fuck.

01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:30.020
So go watch her.

01:07:31.220 --> 01:07:33.780
She's just as base as I am, if not more.

01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:35.220
I know she's definitely more than me.

01:07:37.540 --> 01:07:39.940
But, uh, yeah, just here to be entertained.

01:07:39.940 --> 01:07:41.300
Oops, all brass.

01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:48.900
Uh, but it's, it's like, is it?

01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:50.900
Yeah, you're supposed to be dominant, but you show up.

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:53.140
No, no, no, I'm not supposed to be anything.

01:07:54.180 --> 01:07:56.100
I'm just supposed to be myself.

01:07:56.900 --> 01:07:58.020
And that's the mindset.

01:07:58.020 --> 01:08:05.380
I want to teach you guys is that all the girls are not supposed to be this, this, or that

01:08:06.900 --> 01:08:11.540
because of a kayfabe and like a character design.

01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:13.620
We're just us.

01:08:15.460 --> 01:08:18.900
I'm just she be and you're just can.

01:08:18.900 --> 01:08:30.500
Um, she's telling us by teaching us, but like, naturally, I'll still pull out like,

01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:33.220
you know, don't get it twisted.

01:08:34.580 --> 01:08:40.660
I still will beat you when you're naughty because I like that part of my kayfube.

01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:41.700
I like leaning into that.

01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:45.540
And the girls do like, do like leaning into different parts of theirs.

01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:51.380
Um, but I just wanted to make that distinction for everyone that we were hired to be us.

01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:57.300
And I don't want you to get so wrapped up, you, the viewer, you, the fan to get so wrapped up

01:08:57.300 --> 01:09:05.380
and want somebody, um, should be like due to their lore that you don't enjoy their, their,

01:09:06.340 --> 01:09:08.180
their content because you can enjoy.

01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:12.020
So like, I'm not gonna, let me, I'm trying to think of somebody.

01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:17.780
Uh, I'm not a huge fan of mystery novels.

01:09:18.900 --> 01:09:21.620
Does that mean I'm going to hate Amelia Watson?

01:09:22.900 --> 01:09:29.380
No, she's funny because she's, she'll play into stuff sometimes, but she's not constantly

01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:30.980
searching for mysteries.

01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:34.740
Um, who am I?

01:09:34.740 --> 01:09:35.380
I'm she be.

01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:38.260
I'm she be just me.

01:09:38.260 --> 01:09:41.060
You can find out who I am by watching me stream.

01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:42.740
You aren't enough.

01:09:43.620 --> 01:09:45.940
Atmospheric people make your mom jokes and such.

01:09:45.940 --> 01:09:46.660
That's what I like.

01:09:47.860 --> 01:09:49.300
I'm not big into Dom in general.

01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:51.140
And it's like how she be expresses herself.

01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:52.980
Yeah, exactly.

01:09:52.980 --> 01:09:54.340
I want you to watch me for me.

01:09:55.460 --> 01:10:03.300
Not because of the tags that are associated with my ASMR content on Patreon.

01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:06.420
You know, um, what do you mean she's not detective?

01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:16.100
The real mystery was the friend she made along the way.

01:10:16.740 --> 01:10:17.700
Oh, hi.

01:10:18.340 --> 01:10:22.580
Feeling like I can hire Amelia to find my dad.

01:10:22.580 --> 01:10:23.380
Oh my God.

01:10:24.660 --> 01:10:25.300
Oh, really?

01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:26.580
I can find your mom in these.

01:10:27.220 --> 01:10:27.940
Your mom.

01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:30.740
I like listening to your voices soothing.

01:10:30.740 --> 01:10:31.940
Yeah, I'm a yapper.

01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:34.980
I'm a yappiest yabbit in all the West.

01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:37.620
I mean, you don't own a brothel.

01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:38.260
No, I do.

01:10:38.260 --> 01:10:40.500
Don't, that's actually real.

01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:41.700
Sorry.

01:10:42.980 --> 01:10:46.420
But please, in short, give all the girls a chance.

01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:53.380
Just because you don't like a certain tag doesn't mean you won't enjoy their content.

01:10:53.380 --> 01:10:56.580
Because we're all just cute girls doing cute things.

01:10:56.580 --> 01:11:00.740
And I would hate for you to miss out on cute girls being cute.

01:11:03.220 --> 01:11:03.540
You know?

01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:11.060
If you have another Oshimark besides Madams,

01:11:11.060 --> 01:11:11.940
nook if you book.

01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:13.860
Nook if you book.

01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:14.340
Right.

01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:15.300
No, if you book.

01:11:15.940 --> 01:11:16.900
Instantly plays.

01:11:16.900 --> 01:11:17.780
Get ready.

01:11:21.860 --> 01:11:23.300
Thank you for the tip, Anonymous.

01:11:26.740 --> 01:11:29.540
I think when I see somebody else's Oshimark, I just know that

01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:34.660
you are really passionate about other creators.

01:11:35.620 --> 01:11:37.460
And I know you still like me.

01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:46.900
And I've learned not to take personally that you like us in different ways.

01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:52.180
And there's only so many characters you can do to put in somebody's name.

01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:56.660
I see people with a bazillion Oshimarks in their name.

01:11:56.660 --> 01:11:57.540
It looks fucking cluttered.

01:11:57.540 --> 01:11:58.980
So I get it if you just want one.

01:12:00.340 --> 01:12:03.780
Because then I recognize the majority of them.

01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:05.540
Like there's one that's Azura's.

01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:12.420
And I'm like, yeah, I love Azura.

01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:13.220
Or if it was somebody else.

01:12:13.220 --> 01:12:14.260
Oh, yeah, I see Stroneys.

01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:15.140
Yeah, I love Stroneys.

01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:16.980
Or if it was like some girl from Pixelink.

01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:19.380
Oh, yeah, I love Kana.

01:12:19.380 --> 01:12:19.780
You know?

01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:23.540
It's yeah, so nice knowing people support my friends.

01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:24.660
That's all I care about.

01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:28.660
I am the type of person as a streamer that if I ever got like

01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:33.540
blew the fuck up, I would be doing everything in my power.

01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:34.100
Literally.

01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:36.260
This is why I want to join a vealer because

01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:38.260
Stroneys doing exactly what I wanted to do.

01:12:40.020 --> 01:12:43.460
I'm like, I just want to raise up smaller creators to a bigger platform

01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:46.500
and support them and give them stuff so they can do whatever they want.

01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:49.300
And have a great time and chase their creative dreams.

01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:50.500
That's what I would fucking want too.

01:12:52.980 --> 01:12:54.180
What if you don't like Lawley?

01:12:58.340 --> 01:12:59.220
I don't know what to tell you.

01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:00.900
Uh.

01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:04.660
Start liking them.

01:13:04.660 --> 01:13:07.620
I don't know if you don't like the body type.

01:13:08.740 --> 01:13:12.020
It's like, yeah, people don't like, I won't watch some streamers

01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:13.540
because I don't like the art style of their model.

01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:14.980
So I totally get that.

01:13:15.940 --> 01:13:17.780
I'm like, I'm not into super Western eyes.

01:13:17.780 --> 01:13:21.380
Like mine's a little bit Western, but not too much art styles.

01:13:23.460 --> 01:13:24.500
So like, that's fine.

01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:25.860
I'm not going to fuck them.

01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:30.900
Yeah, but like, I used to also not like that type of body type model

01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:31.540
than I watched.

01:13:32.260 --> 01:13:33.380
Uh, who was it?

01:13:34.740 --> 01:13:35.540
I forget who it was.

01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:39.060
What the fuck was it?

01:13:42.820 --> 01:13:44.180
Are they graduate?

01:13:44.180 --> 01:13:45.780
I think they graduated and that's my camera.

01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:47.700
They're on the top of my head because I haven't watched them in a while.

01:13:47.700 --> 01:13:49.700
But then I was like, oh my God, wait, this bitch is funny.

01:13:53.380 --> 01:13:54.740
Oh, she's a really good voice actress.

01:13:54.740 --> 01:13:57.300
And I like wondered how like people sometimes, you know,

01:13:57.300 --> 01:13:58.820
girls put on voices and some don't.

01:13:58.820 --> 01:14:02.340
I'm like, wow, um, all that stuff.

01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:07.780
I don't watch almost all male vTubers because of the same reason

01:14:07.780 --> 01:14:09.300
I can still watch some of their funny and nice.

01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:09.460
Yeah.

01:14:09.460 --> 01:14:14.980
I usually don't watch male vTubers, uh, because I just can't really,

01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:20.900
I just can't really, um, what's it called?

01:14:20.900 --> 01:14:28.740
Relate to them because I like, some of them have like really bro streams.

01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:31.700
Um, so I'm just like, this is for them.

01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:33.140
This is for the, this is for the bros.

01:14:33.140 --> 01:14:34.180
You're like, this isn't for me.

01:14:34.820 --> 01:14:41.620
Um, and then some of them are also very BFE, which makes me cringe out of my fucking mind.

01:14:42.260 --> 01:14:46.180
But like, I've watched like one or two clips, but it just isn't for me.

01:14:46.180 --> 01:14:47.380
But everybody has their preferences.

01:14:47.380 --> 01:14:49.140
You're allowed, you're allowed preferences.

01:14:51.060 --> 01:14:53.140
Um, skill issue.

01:14:53.140 --> 01:14:54.340
If you don't like that.

01:14:57.620 --> 01:14:58.180
That's funny.

01:14:59.140 --> 01:15:02.260
There's this difference between a vTuber with a small frame and lolly little for me.

01:15:02.260 --> 01:15:02.500
Yeah.

01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:03.380
There's also that.

01:15:04.420 --> 01:15:04.980
I agree.

01:15:04.980 --> 01:15:11.540
Cause like, I look at like, uh, Amy Asami and she's not, she's like small, but she's not lolly.

01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:16.020
You know, like, I was like looking at pretty lady.

01:15:16.020 --> 01:15:17.700
I know I prefer to look at pretty ladies.

01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:20.740
And also, I'll be honest with you, another reason I don't watch male vTubers

01:15:20.980 --> 01:15:27.140
is because, um, they are so limited in their outfits and they're rigging.

01:15:27.860 --> 01:15:34.420
Like I'm sorry, but I've seen so much better rigging for female vTubers.

01:15:34.420 --> 01:15:39.540
And because like just the movement of female vTubers, I don't know what it is.

01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:44.100
It's just, it's just different and men are like the male vTubers usually very stiff.

01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:49.220
Um, I've seen a couple with really good rigs because like I'm someone who I look at when I

01:15:49.220 --> 01:15:54.580
watch a streamer, I appreciate the art, uh, behind it all, like in terms of the actual art

01:15:54.580 --> 01:15:55.220
and the rigging.

01:15:55.940 --> 01:16:03.380
Um, and a lot of male vTubers just fucking don't have good fucking rigging or they also

01:16:03.380 --> 01:16:05.220
have like really boring ass toggles.

01:16:06.740 --> 01:16:08.980
So I'm sorry.

01:16:10.340 --> 01:16:13.140
Male vTubers don't, don't, don't cover my neck please.

01:16:14.500 --> 01:16:15.300
Bald physics.

01:16:15.300 --> 01:16:18.580
So when, yeah, when we get the best designs, I'm like,

01:16:18.580 --> 01:16:19.620
I'm tired.

01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:23.940
I'm seeing the same fucking, fucking Ikemen, Ikemen.

01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:25.060
I can't pronounce it.

01:16:25.060 --> 01:16:25.860
You can make fun of me.

01:16:25.860 --> 01:16:26.260
It's fine.

01:16:27.060 --> 01:16:27.940
Style.

01:16:27.940 --> 01:16:30.740
Like you all dress the same in different fonts.

01:16:32.180 --> 01:16:32.660
I'm done.

01:16:33.460 --> 01:16:33.860
Thank you.

01:16:34.980 --> 01:16:36.980
Enjoy the, enjoy those emotes, girly pop.

01:16:38.020 --> 01:16:43.220
Um, can't really watch you vTubers.

01:16:43.220 --> 01:16:44.820
vTubers is not my cup of tea.

01:16:45.460 --> 01:16:46.580
Brother, what are you doing here?

01:16:46.580 --> 01:16:47.540
What are you, what are you doing?

01:16:47.540 --> 01:16:48.980
This, this agency.

01:16:49.700 --> 01:16:50.740
Brother, I think you're lost.

01:16:52.580 --> 01:16:56.820
Um, it's just like in video games, female characters always look better.

01:16:56.820 --> 01:16:57.620
Yeah, literally.

01:16:57.620 --> 01:16:59.940
No, that's why so many dudes just play female characters.

01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:02.340
My dad will play female characters when he plays games.

01:17:02.340 --> 01:17:04.580
And I remember, I remember like, I'll just like be ragging on them for it.

01:17:04.580 --> 01:17:07.140
I'm like, dad, why are you this chick with big titties?

01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:08.820
He's like, because she got big titties.

01:17:08.820 --> 01:17:11.620
And I'm like, look at her and she's dressed way better.

01:17:11.620 --> 01:17:14.020
Look at all the dudes skins versus the girl skins.

01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:16.340
And I'm like, you know what, you're fucking right, dad.

01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:22.500
Um, Facebook shop blocks go hard.

01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:26.580
We were hot men in games.

01:17:31.940 --> 01:17:33.300
It'd be that simple.

01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:34.500
It'd be that simple.

01:17:35.860 --> 01:17:36.740
If I can create a kid.

01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:38.980
Yeah, women have like so much funner's things.

01:17:38.980 --> 01:17:41.620
Like I remember when I played Baldur's Gate for the first time,

01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:43.380
I was like, okay, I'll make a girl and a boy.

01:17:44.260 --> 01:17:45.060
Baldur's Gate 3.

01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:45.780
So I made a girl.

01:17:46.900 --> 01:17:52.820
She was just really cute, like, elven, for like dark, for like,

01:17:52.820 --> 01:17:54.340
I can't fucking remember what I made her.

01:17:54.340 --> 01:17:58.740
But she was like tan skin, bright red hair, freckles,

01:17:58.740 --> 01:18:03.620
really cool, like tattoos, all this other shit, like makeup, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:18:03.620 --> 01:18:05.620
And then I went to the do the dude and I'm like,

01:18:05.620 --> 01:18:08.420
okay, I can do beard one, two, three, four, five.

01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:10.180
I can change the eye color.

01:18:10.180 --> 01:18:11.140
I can give him a scar.

01:18:11.460 --> 01:18:14.820
Women pretty.

01:18:16.580 --> 01:18:19.860
Dress up is, I love dressing up like in like games,

01:18:19.860 --> 01:18:22.980
like I'll usually take like, I take forever.

01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:24.660
The majority of me playing Elden Ring,

01:18:24.660 --> 01:18:27.620
probably like 50 of those hours is me just like trying to look pretty.

01:18:29.780 --> 01:18:31.620
Men get toothpick or burly.

01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:33.060
Literally, literally though.

01:18:34.820 --> 01:18:37.220
I'm picking guys too, but the options be limited.

01:18:37.940 --> 01:18:40.100
Whenever it comes to RPG stuff, I always make a male, female,

01:18:40.180 --> 01:18:42.340
self-insert, but I often play the female character more often,

01:18:42.340 --> 01:18:43.060
even though I'm a guy.

01:18:43.060 --> 01:18:44.580
Yeah, it's just more appealing to look at.

01:18:46.260 --> 01:18:50.260
And like, I'll like growing up, I usually played a lot of male characters,

01:18:50.820 --> 01:18:55.140
just because I didn't like being pointed out,

01:18:55.140 --> 01:18:58.100
being female and just kind of like griefed in, in games and stuff.

01:18:58.820 --> 01:19:02.980
And I'll be honest with you, I probably made the same character over and over and over again,

01:19:02.980 --> 01:19:05.060
just some emo looking dude.

01:19:05.060 --> 01:19:08.420
Some emo like looking twink was my character throughout the years.

01:19:08.420 --> 01:19:14.420
I'm just like black hair, eyes, some gothy looking outfit in your golden.

01:19:15.140 --> 01:19:15.940
And that's what I did.

01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:19.300
And then I did it because I didn't want to play a female and be all like,

01:19:19.300 --> 01:19:20.660
and be the center of attention.

01:19:24.100 --> 01:19:25.380
Oh gee, can you date me?

01:19:25.380 --> 01:19:29.460
Literally though, literally, I would just get like, oh, I just, I couldn't.

01:19:30.100 --> 01:19:34.180
And that's why I like, I didn't, I didn't, I wouldn't talk in like, game lobbies.

01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:35.780
The same reason too.

01:19:36.340 --> 01:19:37.700
We need she be to play Stila Blade.

01:19:37.700 --> 01:19:40.900
You just want me to drool in like, the entire time.

01:19:41.460 --> 01:19:44.100
Ah, so Shibani is, she'd be his ideal man.

01:19:46.260 --> 01:19:46.900
Are you a girl?

01:19:53.540 --> 01:19:55.380
Or just like people be like, hey, let's be friends.

01:19:55.380 --> 01:19:56.500
And then they try to like, just like,

01:19:57.780 --> 01:19:58.820
E-sexing you up.

01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:04.260
Oh, we'll have some straights this mail.

01:20:04.580 --> 01:20:08.100
Um, just be so cool.

01:20:09.140 --> 01:20:15.380
I remember people used to say, uh, call like, say grill, like G-R-I-L-L.

01:20:15.380 --> 01:20:20.500
Cause I think, or like, man, like I would play Wolf Quest.

01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:23.060
And which I'm going to be playing next week as well.

01:20:23.060 --> 01:20:24.660
We're playing fucking Wolf Quest.

01:20:24.660 --> 01:20:26.820
And we're going to go find a mate and have puppies.

01:20:27.380 --> 01:20:33.540
And, um, and, uh, people would say grail, grill.

01:20:33.540 --> 01:20:36.980
As in like cook, as like mail, as in like M-A-I-L.

01:20:36.980 --> 01:20:39.300
Cause people kept asking about it.

01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:42.740
And they would just do, to fucking so much E-sex and Wolf Quest.

01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:47.380
I used to say I was a boy in every game straight out.

01:20:47.380 --> 01:20:49.780
Cause I was like, yes, literally, four gets it.

01:20:51.380 --> 01:20:52.340
A hundred percent.

01:20:52.980 --> 01:20:54.020
I would literally just do that.

01:20:55.380 --> 01:20:59.060
I remember I went by like a mail version of my IRL name.

01:21:00.100 --> 01:21:03.300
And I remember I had the girlies still fucking falling for me though.

01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:08.660
You know, nobody can, I need a, I need a lip bite toggle.

01:21:08.660 --> 01:21:10.180
And we have to ask mom for that.

01:21:11.460 --> 01:21:13.380
Mom, can I, can I get a lip bite toggle?

01:21:13.380 --> 01:21:22.340
So I could be like, wait, can I, no, I can't do anything similar.

01:21:24.740 --> 01:21:25.460
Shaboris.

01:21:25.460 --> 01:21:27.060
Yeah, I was Shaboris all the time.

01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:29.620
Insane aura.

01:21:31.700 --> 01:21:33.700
And uh, yeah, it was just, it was just easier.

01:21:34.500 --> 01:21:35.860
And then I would have to tell the girlies.

01:21:35.860 --> 01:21:37.860
They'll be like, why don't you get a voice call with me?

01:21:38.500 --> 01:21:41.940
And I'm like, types out, sorry babe.

01:21:42.820 --> 01:21:44.580
Uh, I'm too shy.

01:21:47.460 --> 01:21:50.260
Yeah, I remember I was like, I'm guy on the line as a dude for a bit.

01:21:50.260 --> 01:21:51.060
And I was a girl.

01:21:53.460 --> 01:21:54.500
How many female moms?

01:21:55.300 --> 01:21:57.300
Mike doesn't work.

01:21:57.300 --> 01:21:58.660
Sorry, my mic's broken.

01:21:58.660 --> 01:21:59.300
Baby case.

01:22:01.460 --> 01:22:08.420
Oh, if I was a dude or if I was a lesbian, I would be a fucking menace to society.

01:22:09.140 --> 01:22:10.500
I would be a womanizer.

01:22:13.060 --> 01:22:15.860
I just feel like I would be the shittiest fucking dude.

01:22:15.860 --> 01:22:19.860
I would just be the opposite because like me, I'm a very sweet, very caring,

01:22:19.860 --> 01:22:22.740
I'm a very affectionate, lovable person if I really like you.

01:22:24.820 --> 01:22:27.540
I am very protective over people that I care about,

01:22:27.540 --> 01:22:30.100
but I just feel like if I was a dude, I'd just be a piece of shit.

01:22:32.580 --> 01:22:33.860
I would definitely be an F boy.

01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:35.860
I think I would be a fuck boy.

01:22:40.020 --> 01:22:41.620
Hey, you wanna be my discord kid?

01:22:44.100 --> 01:22:48.660
I would love to see my hands as a necklace around your neck, baby girl.

01:22:48.660 --> 01:22:54.740
Some pictures of your asshole.

01:22:58.580 --> 01:22:59.780
Can you mail for me, kitten?

01:23:10.900 --> 01:23:12.420
Dad actually, no, I'm above that.

01:23:15.940 --> 01:23:18.100
Tom boy, she be when I'm already a tomboy.

01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:22.660
I think, I think I am in my tomboy.

01:23:23.780 --> 01:23:24.180
I don't know.

01:23:25.300 --> 01:23:29.060
I was like very, again, growing up, I was always taller than all the boys

01:23:29.060 --> 01:23:31.220
and I've always been very, very fucking strong.

01:23:31.220 --> 01:23:38.740
I remember one time I was playing basketball with these kids and I don't know why I did this,

01:23:38.740 --> 01:23:45.540
but I picked one of the guys up off the ground and I threw him back down

01:23:45.540 --> 01:23:50.980
to get the basketball from him and he started crying and I called him a little bitch.

01:23:52.660 --> 01:23:54.340
And I'm like, why are you crying?

01:23:54.340 --> 01:23:59.620
And then he's just like, and I was like, we were like 14.

01:23:59.620 --> 01:24:00.980
It's not like we were like seven.

01:24:00.980 --> 01:24:02.260
It's like we were like 14.

01:24:06.100 --> 01:24:07.540
And I like chucked him.

01:24:07.540 --> 01:24:12.100
And then I also used to play a lot of football at my after school program

01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:14.020
because we had a lot of sports there.

01:24:14.820 --> 01:24:18.020
So it was very like my after school program was very athletic.

01:24:18.580 --> 01:24:20.660
And so we would play football.

01:24:20.660 --> 01:24:24.740
I would be fucking mowing down the boys in my grade.

01:24:25.700 --> 01:24:26.500
American football.

01:24:26.500 --> 01:24:26.740
Yes.

01:24:27.460 --> 01:24:28.500
And soccer too.

01:24:28.500 --> 01:24:30.420
And you know, European football.

01:24:32.180 --> 01:24:33.860
I would be mowing down motherfuckers.

01:24:34.900 --> 01:24:36.260
I wasn't a bully.

01:24:36.260 --> 01:24:36.980
I wasn't a bully.

01:24:36.980 --> 01:24:38.580
I was just bigger and stronger than people.

01:24:38.580 --> 01:24:39.860
I can't help it.

01:24:39.860 --> 01:24:41.300
I would fucking everybody.

01:24:41.300 --> 01:24:44.100
I was like five, six at age 14.

01:24:44.100 --> 01:24:44.980
What do you want me to do?

01:24:45.620 --> 01:24:46.180
I'm sorry.

01:24:46.180 --> 01:24:48.740
All you bros were fucking five feet tall.

01:24:49.860 --> 01:24:50.740
What do you expect me to do?

01:24:50.740 --> 01:24:52.820
I'm going to fucking roundhouse kick you to the face.

01:24:57.380 --> 01:24:58.100
I'm five, six.

01:24:58.100 --> 01:24:58.980
I'm taller than you.

01:25:00.180 --> 01:25:01.220
Bro, I'm five, eight.

01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:03.620
I'm so sorry.

01:25:06.340 --> 01:25:07.140
Have you stiff arm?

01:25:07.140 --> 01:25:07.860
I don't know what that means.

01:25:09.140 --> 01:25:10.900
Like, I don't know what that means actually.

01:25:12.180 --> 01:25:16.020
They're five feet and 14 at their time.

01:25:17.300 --> 01:25:18.500
Flexing female puberty.

01:25:18.500 --> 01:25:19.620
It's true though.

01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:20.180
It's true.

01:25:21.140 --> 01:25:23.700
I remember I was like, how old was I?

01:25:23.700 --> 01:25:26.900
Because you start, you go through puberty

01:25:26.900 --> 01:25:27.540
when you get your period.

01:25:27.540 --> 01:25:28.260
I think I was like 12.

01:25:30.900 --> 01:25:31.220
One.

01:25:32.980 --> 01:25:36.100
I had fucking C cups at 14.

01:25:39.220 --> 01:25:40.500
My parents were concerned.

01:25:41.700 --> 01:25:44.340
Again, I was also five, six at that age.

01:25:44.340 --> 01:25:45.940
My family was very concerned.

01:25:46.740 --> 01:25:49.460
So they took me to the doctor and they were like, oh,

01:25:50.180 --> 01:25:53.620
she needs to stop drinking milk because I was drinking,

01:25:53.620 --> 01:25:56.980
like the milk I was drinking, I think it still happens to kids,

01:25:56.980 --> 01:26:00.500
but they have so many hormones in them that I grew up way too fast.

01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:04.020
They, if I didn't stop drinking milk, they said the hormones in the milk,

01:26:04.020 --> 01:26:07.220
I would have been, they said I would have been like six feet tall.

01:26:07.460 --> 01:26:11.540
I was, I was growing too fast.

01:26:11.540 --> 01:26:15.140
I was, I was in so much pain because I was growing too fast.

01:26:18.180 --> 01:26:19.700
Five, 11 at 14, six foot two.

01:26:19.700 --> 01:26:21.220
See, okay, you're like, that's fine.

01:26:23.540 --> 01:26:27.860
They said, oh, she's going to be either from five, nine to six, four

01:26:28.580 --> 01:26:30.900
when they're like estimating my height.

01:26:31.540 --> 01:26:35.460
My mom is five, five and my dad is six, four.

01:26:36.180 --> 01:26:37.700
And then my mom was just like, oh God.

01:26:38.660 --> 01:26:40.980
And then my dad's like, I can teach her to ball

01:26:40.980 --> 01:26:43.220
because my dad was a basketball coach.

01:26:43.220 --> 01:26:44.020
I can't do basketball.

01:26:44.020 --> 01:26:45.380
I fucking suck at basketball.

01:26:46.260 --> 01:26:52.100
I preferred, I preferred like football or soccer for sports.

01:26:53.460 --> 01:26:55.620
And everybody would always ask like, oh, you play ball.

01:26:55.620 --> 01:26:56.580
Oh, you must play ball.

01:26:56.580 --> 01:26:58.100
You so to, oh, you're only 14.

01:26:58.100 --> 01:26:58.820
You must play ball.

01:26:58.820 --> 01:27:01.540
I'm like, no, no, brother.

01:27:01.540 --> 01:27:05.140
I don't, I fucking suck.

01:27:05.140 --> 01:27:06.180
I can run fast.

01:27:08.020 --> 01:27:10.980
And like my dad was, I swear my dad was sort of supportive

01:27:10.980 --> 01:27:13.460
because I couldn't play basketball because again,

01:27:13.460 --> 01:27:18.100
my dad was like, what was it?

01:27:18.100 --> 01:27:20.180
Like a heist, I have to look it up.

01:27:21.620 --> 01:27:24.740
Like an amateur league basketball coach.

01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:25.940
My dad was good at it too.

01:27:26.900 --> 01:27:28.100
Have you juked anyone out in football?

01:27:28.100 --> 01:27:28.980
A hundred percent.

01:27:29.540 --> 01:27:30.500
A hundred percent.

01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:33.620
I had the tightest fucking turns, bro.

01:27:34.260 --> 01:27:34.740
Tight.

01:27:36.100 --> 01:27:37.380
Whippin' that shit, bro.

01:27:40.820 --> 01:27:42.740
How rich I school interaction.

01:27:42.740 --> 01:27:45.940
But it's funny because like, I was like, I was,

01:27:45.940 --> 01:27:47.620
I had like a sleeper built.

01:27:48.420 --> 01:27:49.620
I had a sleeper built.

01:27:50.900 --> 01:27:51.780
I was tall.

01:27:51.780 --> 01:27:52.980
I was skinny as fuck.

01:27:53.700 --> 01:27:55.220
You're like, oh, she can't be strong.

01:27:55.220 --> 01:27:55.460
No.

01:27:57.060 --> 01:27:58.420
I'm chucking you across the room.

01:27:58.420 --> 01:28:00.020
I'm chucking you across the field.

01:28:00.020 --> 01:28:01.460
I'm sending you home crying to your mom

01:28:02.100 --> 01:28:04.180
because apparently I'm playing too rough with the kids

01:28:04.180 --> 01:28:05.700
because I don't know my own strength.

01:28:05.700 --> 01:28:06.100
Listen.

01:28:11.220 --> 01:28:13.460
And like, also I was super fucking shy.

01:28:14.740 --> 01:28:16.820
But then like, I got this like animalistic

01:28:17.780 --> 01:28:20.980
for feralness about me when I would play sports.

01:28:23.540 --> 01:28:26.500
And then, and same thing, same thing with fucking jujitsu.

01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:30.980
Dudes would be like, because it was a co-ed school.

01:28:31.780 --> 01:28:32.580
I couldn't roll.

01:28:32.580 --> 01:28:35.620
I didn't roll with a lot of the girls because uh,

01:28:37.620 --> 01:28:39.620
well, some of the girls didn't want to roll with me

01:28:39.620 --> 01:28:42.740
because I was just, I was just stronger.

01:28:44.100 --> 01:28:47.620
Um, but like not, not that you can't submit somebody,

01:28:47.620 --> 01:28:49.620
but when you're learning, it's not fair.

01:28:50.820 --> 01:28:53.620
Cause then at that point, you don't have the skill

01:28:53.620 --> 01:28:55.140
to beat someone stronger than you.

01:28:55.140 --> 01:28:56.580
So I would have to roll with the guys

01:28:56.580 --> 01:28:57.700
or people have a higher belt.

01:28:57.860 --> 01:28:59.460
Just because I would just hold you there.

01:28:59.460 --> 01:29:02.980
Like I, I was strong enough, especially my fucking legs.

01:29:02.980 --> 01:29:06.180
I would just hold you there and just let you squirm,

01:29:06.980 --> 01:29:08.580
squeeze you between my legs.

01:29:08.580 --> 01:29:11.940
You try to get out, but I'm going to comeore you

01:29:11.940 --> 01:29:12.980
or a more economy you.

01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:14.740
I'm, I'm sorry.

01:29:16.900 --> 01:29:18.660
You know, you're in my guard.

01:29:18.660 --> 01:29:20.420
I could still do that if you're in my guard.

01:29:23.460 --> 01:29:24.580
For free?

01:29:24.580 --> 01:29:25.460
For free?

01:29:26.340 --> 01:29:26.980
For free?

01:29:28.740 --> 01:29:30.660
I sound like I'm really fucking humble bragging though.

01:29:32.820 --> 01:29:34.500
I'm scared the pegging might be real.

01:29:34.500 --> 01:29:37.780
Um, maybe when we get fans late, I'll be loud.

01:29:38.340 --> 01:29:40.180
Cause people keep asking me, when are you gonna get a strap?

01:29:42.180 --> 01:29:44.100
And we just, do you want me to sit there

01:29:44.100 --> 01:29:46.180
like a fucking, how some dudes do it?

01:29:46.180 --> 01:29:48.180
How some dudes send, take pics and just be like,

01:29:48.180 --> 01:29:49.620
you like what you see.

01:29:49.620 --> 01:29:51.220
Do you like this angle?

01:29:51.220 --> 01:29:52.180
Do you like this?

01:29:52.180 --> 01:29:54.340
And I'm like, you want me to take pictures like that?

01:29:54.340 --> 01:29:55.060
What do you want me to do?

01:29:56.420 --> 01:29:57.620
Please test these moves on us.

01:29:57.620 --> 01:29:58.340
I beg of you.

01:30:03.300 --> 01:30:03.860
I'm sorry.

01:30:05.220 --> 01:30:08.260
Not that I don't like tributes, but

01:30:12.900 --> 01:30:14.500
or I should call them something else.

01:30:14.500 --> 01:30:16.740
Stroni said I needed to say code words for things.

01:30:16.740 --> 01:30:17.860
I should work on that.

01:30:17.860 --> 01:30:21.060
Um, not saying I don't like treats.

01:30:21.940 --> 01:30:22.820
The fuck is on my,

01:30:22.820 --> 01:30:25.780
the fuck is on my titty?

01:30:30.420 --> 01:30:31.780
I'm a fucking zit.

01:30:31.780 --> 01:30:32.100
Okay.

01:30:32.100 --> 01:30:32.660
Don't touch it.

01:30:33.220 --> 01:30:38.820
Um, not that, uh, I don't like like,

01:30:38.820 --> 01:30:41.140
like little treats that I get sent, but

01:30:44.180 --> 01:30:48.100
I'm like, I compare like the girlies on Twitter

01:30:48.100 --> 01:30:49.620
that be posting their pictures

01:30:49.620 --> 01:30:52.660
and then the dudes on Twitter

01:30:52.660 --> 01:30:53.620
that be posting their pictures.

01:30:53.620 --> 01:30:54.100
I'm sorry.

01:30:54.100 --> 01:30:54.740
Girls win.

01:30:55.700 --> 01:30:57.540
They're a lot more creative with their poses.

01:31:00.340 --> 01:31:01.220
Dudes just stand.

01:31:01.220 --> 01:31:02.420
I wish I could demonstrate.

01:31:09.460 --> 01:31:10.900
I also want to, um, I saw that

01:31:10.900 --> 01:31:13.060
Cottontail VA to the thing where, um,

01:31:13.700 --> 01:31:16.740
she like crushed a milk jug between your thighs.

01:31:16.740 --> 01:31:18.980
I definitely want to do that for like a milestone.

01:31:19.860 --> 01:31:22.580
Maybe when we hit 10 K, it's funny.

01:31:22.580 --> 01:31:25.300
Like, I just want to say like,

01:31:26.900 --> 01:31:29.620
literally my goal, one of the goals I put in my debut

01:31:29.620 --> 01:31:33.300
was hit 10 K subscribers and we're already at six K

01:31:33.300 --> 01:31:34.500
and I'm just like, what the fuck?

01:31:36.020 --> 01:31:38.580
I'm like, I expected to be at like 800 by now.

01:31:41.540 --> 01:31:42.820
She's a watermelon too.

01:31:42.820 --> 01:31:43.460
Oh shit.

01:31:43.460 --> 01:31:44.180
Okay.

01:31:44.180 --> 01:31:45.300
Man, I need to work out again.

01:31:45.300 --> 01:31:49.700
I've been, I've been, since I've been laid up at home,

01:31:50.820 --> 01:31:51.540
being depressed.

01:31:53.140 --> 01:31:54.500
I haven't, I haven't worked out.

01:31:55.300 --> 01:31:57.220
I need to, I need to do stretches.

01:31:57.220 --> 01:31:57.940
I need to get ready.

01:31:59.860 --> 01:32:01.860
I don't look at pics of dude on Twitter.

01:32:02.420 --> 01:32:06.100
Uh, neither do I, but the Twitter algorithm just fucking happens

01:32:06.100 --> 01:32:07.380
and shit just shows up.

01:32:07.380 --> 01:32:07.620
So

01:32:12.500 --> 01:32:14.340
he's hit 10 K right now.

01:32:14.340 --> 01:32:20.100
But yeah, I just, I'm just very thankful for the amount of growth

01:32:20.100 --> 01:32:21.460
that we've had as a company.

01:32:22.340 --> 01:32:24.820
It just boggles my mind to be honest.

01:32:24.820 --> 01:32:28.020
I didn't, not that I didn't believe that we could do it.

01:32:28.020 --> 01:32:33.140
I just didn't think just because of like negativity and coverage

01:32:33.140 --> 01:32:33.940
and all that stuff.

01:32:33.940 --> 01:32:37.780
I just didn't think people would enjoy us as much as they do

01:32:37.780 --> 01:32:38.740
and I'm so happy.

01:32:41.380 --> 01:32:43.540
How would you describe your peak build?

01:32:43.540 --> 01:32:45.140
Like Elden Ring?

01:32:45.140 --> 01:32:49.380
No, like on a partner or on myself?

01:32:50.260 --> 01:32:53.060
Because for me, I don't really care what you look like.

01:32:54.020 --> 01:32:58.100
I'm like, I would just want you to be healthy and be really funny.

01:33:00.100 --> 01:33:09.060
And then for myself, I would like B cup titties.

01:33:09.460 --> 01:33:13.620
And I would like to shrink my tummy a bit.

01:33:13.620 --> 01:33:14.180
That is it.

01:33:16.100 --> 01:33:18.420
Although if I could, I would look like lean beef patty,

01:33:18.980 --> 01:33:20.420
but my body type just won't allow that.

01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:27.220
Because like genetically, because like guys are like, oh, flat stomachs.

01:33:27.220 --> 01:33:32.020
Oh, like I'm like, I'm, I'm skinny, average size.

01:33:32.020 --> 01:33:36.580
But because of my genetics and being a woman, uh, people are like,

01:33:37.140 --> 01:33:42.740
you're fat because I have a little protective pouch of fat around my uterus.

01:33:42.740 --> 01:33:50.340
If I were to have a child, um, even my mom, who at my age was like 99 pounds,

01:33:50.340 --> 01:33:53.380
if not less than little, no, she was definitely like a hundred pounds

01:33:53.380 --> 01:33:57.220
and like five, five, she was sure as fuck and skinny as a fucking rail.

01:33:57.220 --> 01:34:01.220
She also didn't have a flat stomach because just genetically, she just had a little bump.

01:34:02.420 --> 01:34:03.220
Child makes it better.

01:34:03.220 --> 01:34:04.900
That's my, I agree with you.

01:34:05.620 --> 01:34:06.260
I agree.

01:34:06.260 --> 01:34:07.140
Squish is good.

01:34:07.860 --> 01:34:10.340
A little bit more hold on to, you know what I'm saying?

01:34:10.340 --> 01:34:12.500
Not that I don't enjoy like a skinnier build though.

01:34:13.540 --> 01:34:16.100
Like I, I honestly, I love the human form so much.

01:34:16.100 --> 01:34:17.860
Becoming so many shapes and sizes.

01:34:17.860 --> 01:34:18.740
It's gorgeous.

01:34:18.740 --> 01:34:19.300
I love it.

01:34:21.620 --> 01:34:23.940
Men and women appreciation in this house.

01:34:23.940 --> 01:34:24.420
Okay.

01:34:24.420 --> 01:34:24.980
You're cute.

01:34:24.980 --> 01:34:25.540
You're gorgeous.

01:34:25.540 --> 01:34:26.020
You're beautiful.

01:34:27.300 --> 01:34:29.540
Let me kiss you.

01:34:29.540 --> 01:34:31.300
I was going to say something else, but I can't say that.

01:34:32.260 --> 01:34:34.740
It doesn't even look bad based on your photos.

01:34:34.740 --> 01:34:35.220
Looks pretty.

01:34:36.980 --> 01:34:41.620
I can't, I know that you're like trying to compliment me, but that sounds weird.

01:34:44.580 --> 01:34:46.420
Yours don't even look that bad.

01:34:57.300 --> 01:34:59.780
I don't care how people think about my body type either way.

01:34:59.780 --> 01:35:02.580
One, because I'm a Vtuber, you're barely going to see it.

01:35:02.580 --> 01:35:04.660
That was just for the monetization milestone.

01:35:04.660 --> 01:35:06.580
I'm not cosplaying myself constantly.

01:35:06.580 --> 01:35:08.900
I'm sorry if you thought that you're going to see me

01:35:10.180 --> 01:35:12.900
blasting my, my kuchi-hu-ha on fans.

01:35:12.900 --> 01:35:14.100
Lee, that's not going to happen.

01:35:15.540 --> 01:35:17.140
No, it's only to use straight homeboy.

01:35:19.140 --> 01:35:21.300
I'm, you're going to, you're going to get the model.

01:35:21.300 --> 01:35:21.940
Oh hi, Rena.

01:35:25.140 --> 01:35:26.580
I mean, it's all right.

01:35:26.580 --> 01:35:28.500
Like it could be better.

01:35:30.660 --> 01:35:32.260
Like, I'm sorry.

01:35:32.260 --> 01:35:34.740
You're not going to see any real life content from me.

01:35:34.740 --> 01:35:36.500
I don't know about the other girls, but not from me.

01:35:37.700 --> 01:35:38.980
I'm here to make ASMR.

01:35:38.980 --> 01:35:40.020
I'm here to voice act.

01:35:40.820 --> 01:35:46.260
I'm here to be, you know, your girly pop or something.

01:35:46.260 --> 01:35:47.460
Don't only get to your head.

01:35:47.460 --> 01:35:48.980
I'm here to be your mistress.

01:35:48.980 --> 01:35:50.180
You don't make demands of madam.

01:35:51.060 --> 01:35:52.500
You get little treats now and then.

01:35:54.660 --> 01:35:55.780
I think anyone's complaining.

01:35:55.780 --> 01:35:56.340
Yeah.

01:35:56.340 --> 01:35:58.420
Because some people are like, oh, they're going to be like,

01:35:59.140 --> 01:36:00.180
the Emma G girls.

01:36:00.180 --> 01:36:02.900
No, we're, no, at least I'm not fucking doing that.

01:36:03.460 --> 01:36:06.020
It's hot though, but I'm sorry.

01:36:06.020 --> 01:36:08.340
And I'm not fucking my gen mates in an off collab.

01:36:10.340 --> 01:36:13.060
How does this weird business practice?

01:36:13.700 --> 01:36:14.740
I'm not a porn star.

01:36:16.500 --> 01:36:17.700
But what girls, there are other,

01:36:17.700 --> 01:36:22.580
there are Japanese AVTuber agencies that do that sort of content.

01:36:22.580 --> 01:36:23.860
And I don't knock them for it.

01:36:23.860 --> 01:36:26.100
I think it's fucking amazing that you get essentially

01:36:26.100 --> 01:36:27.140
as a porn star VTuber.

01:36:27.140 --> 01:36:28.020
Like that's fucking sick.

01:36:29.380 --> 01:36:33.380
But yeah, ruined.

01:36:33.380 --> 01:36:34.740
I'm going to have, guys,

01:36:34.740 --> 01:36:36.820
should I have a watermelon blueberry

01:36:36.820 --> 01:36:38.660
or the mystery color airhead?

01:36:38.660 --> 01:36:40.020
I also need to get a drink.

01:36:40.020 --> 01:36:40.740
Quite thirsty.

01:36:41.940 --> 01:36:44.260
Have you finished the main story for inscription yet?

01:36:44.260 --> 01:36:46.100
Bro, I didn't even start playing the game yet.

01:36:46.740 --> 01:36:47.540
We're just talking.

01:36:48.420 --> 01:36:50.660
I've been in inscription like three times.

01:36:53.220 --> 01:36:55.300
I just haven't done them on stream mystery.

01:36:55.940 --> 01:36:56.260
Mystery.

01:36:56.260 --> 01:36:57.300
Okay, we sing mystery.

01:36:58.420 --> 01:37:01.220
I'll do mystery, then I'll do watermelon

01:37:01.220 --> 01:37:02.420
because people are saying watermelon.

01:37:08.660 --> 01:37:10.580
Johnny's asking how long I'm streaming.

01:37:12.740 --> 01:37:13.620
Probably too late.

01:37:14.420 --> 01:37:15.380
Why does she message me?

01:37:15.380 --> 01:37:16.340
Hold on, okay, discord.

01:37:25.060 --> 01:37:27.540
Oh my God, a giant fucking.

01:37:27.620 --> 01:37:29.060
What is that?

01:37:29.060 --> 01:37:30.660
What is that fucking bug?

01:37:30.660 --> 01:37:31.300
I need to take a picture.

01:37:31.300 --> 01:37:31.700
Holy shit.

01:37:31.700 --> 01:37:32.260
What is this?

01:37:33.860 --> 01:37:35.060
Mind you, I know my bugs.

01:37:35.060 --> 01:37:36.260
I've never seen this before in my life.

01:37:46.420 --> 01:37:47.300
What are you?

01:37:47.300 --> 01:37:47.780
Hello?

01:37:53.780 --> 01:37:55.620
Okay, it looks like it has the body of a wasp.

01:37:56.420 --> 01:37:57.780
It was the head of an ant.

01:37:57.780 --> 01:37:58.980
It's very thin and narrow.

01:37:59.620 --> 01:38:01.620
I thought it was like a locus or something,

01:38:01.620 --> 01:38:03.060
but it's not a cricket.

01:38:03.060 --> 01:38:04.020
The legs are too small.

01:38:04.020 --> 01:38:04.580
What the fuck?

01:38:06.340 --> 01:38:07.060
I need to piss.

01:38:14.580 --> 01:38:16.740
I just choked on this fucking thing.

01:38:25.780 --> 01:38:26.340
I'm sorry.

01:38:37.860 --> 01:38:39.300
Okay, I'll respond to the letter.

01:38:40.740 --> 01:38:43.860
Um, the girl leaves for my collab tomorrow,

01:38:43.860 --> 01:38:45.300
like, hey, thumbnail.

01:38:45.300 --> 01:38:47.540
So I'll post something more later.

01:38:49.140 --> 01:38:49.700
Hi, Sheeby.

01:38:49.700 --> 01:38:50.900
Mom, I'd like to redirect here.

01:38:50.900 --> 01:38:51.780
You think you'd be...

01:38:51.780 --> 01:38:53.540
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:38:53.540 --> 01:38:54.500
100%.

01:38:54.500 --> 01:38:56.020
I'm gonna be up for a couple hours.

01:38:56.900 --> 01:38:57.860
I gotta piss.

01:38:58.900 --> 01:39:00.420
Sorry, I'm gonna keep saying that until I go.

01:39:04.260 --> 01:39:04.580
Hmm.

01:39:05.940 --> 01:39:06.820
The watermelon's good.

01:39:12.820 --> 01:39:14.180
It might be a persic, wa.

01:39:14.180 --> 01:39:15.780
I don't know, it's so huge.

01:39:15.780 --> 01:39:16.260
It's probably...

01:39:20.340 --> 01:39:21.620
I'm trying to think of a comparison.

01:39:24.260 --> 01:39:25.220
Using my pill bottle.

01:39:35.060 --> 01:39:38.820
It's like, I have a 15 pro phone.

01:39:39.700 --> 01:39:40.740
It's like half the size...

01:39:40.740 --> 01:39:43.780
It's like, lengthwise, it's half the size of my phone.

01:39:47.300 --> 01:39:49.940
But it's super...

01:39:49.940 --> 01:39:51.140
I've never seen this butt before.

01:39:51.140 --> 01:39:52.180
It's staring at me.

01:39:53.780 --> 01:39:55.060
It's literally looking at me.

01:39:55.060 --> 01:39:56.100
I know it's looking at me.

01:39:56.740 --> 01:39:58.100
What the fuck are you, bro?

01:39:58.100 --> 01:39:59.140
I need to identify you.

01:40:05.700 --> 01:40:06.660
I can't see his waist.

01:40:07.780 --> 01:40:08.660
What are you doing, bitch?

01:40:08.660 --> 01:40:09.700
Stop staring at me.

01:40:10.500 --> 01:40:11.940
Staring at me because I'm not wearing pants.

01:40:14.740 --> 01:40:16.900
Remember, Plee comes from the club door.

01:40:18.740 --> 01:40:19.540
Let him inside?

01:40:19.540 --> 01:40:20.100
Okay, yeah.

01:40:21.060 --> 01:40:27.620
It has six legs, two long antennae, long narrow body, reddish,

01:40:29.220 --> 01:40:31.380
reddish-orange, ants moving like head,

01:40:31.380 --> 01:40:35.700
but doesn't have the jaws of an ant.

01:40:37.700 --> 01:40:38.180
It's like that.

01:40:38.180 --> 01:40:39.220
The head shape of the eyes.

01:40:40.180 --> 01:40:42.660
It looks like it's divided in three sections.

01:40:42.660 --> 01:40:46.340
You have the head, the middle section, and the body.

01:40:46.340 --> 01:40:49.620
But it's very little distinction between the main body

01:40:50.180 --> 01:40:51.700
and the latter part of the body.

01:40:51.700 --> 01:40:53.700
It literally just turned its head to look at me.

01:40:53.700 --> 01:40:54.900
It's literally looking at me.

01:40:54.900 --> 01:40:56.740
Why do you have so much self-awareness, bro?

01:40:57.380 --> 01:40:57.780
Stop.

01:41:03.060 --> 01:41:05.540
By the way, should we do a play on the weekends?

01:41:05.540 --> 01:41:05.940
Quick ball.

01:41:07.380 --> 01:41:09.380
I'm doing the UNO club.

01:41:09.380 --> 01:41:11.220
I might do a gorilla debating.

01:41:11.220 --> 01:41:13.860
I do realize I need to probably take breaks, though,

01:41:13.860 --> 01:41:14.660
like have a dig off.

01:41:15.380 --> 01:41:20.740
Do you need me to cover her cleavage?

01:41:20.740 --> 01:41:21.140
Oh, yes.

01:41:21.700 --> 01:41:22.980
Wait, did mommy read?

01:41:25.140 --> 01:41:27.700
Or is she just asking for like 20 minutes or not?

01:41:28.580 --> 01:41:29.140
But yeah.

01:41:33.220 --> 01:41:34.740
I need to do the corals, please.

01:41:36.580 --> 01:41:44.020
Orange, orange, orange, orange, orange, orange, orange, orange.

01:41:44.020 --> 01:41:44.900
Say what I really want.

01:41:44.900 --> 01:41:48.900
I'm sorry.

01:41:56.900 --> 01:41:57.380
Boats.

01:41:59.060 --> 01:41:59.380
Back.

01:42:00.660 --> 01:42:02.900
Like a wasp.

01:42:14.740 --> 01:42:25.060
This literally looks like none of them.

01:42:25.060 --> 01:42:26.580
It looks like a wasp, but it isn't.

01:42:35.300 --> 01:42:36.100
This again, I'm sorry.

01:42:36.100 --> 01:42:37.220
I'm a very curious person.

01:42:37.220 --> 01:42:38.660
This is going to bother me if I don't figure out

01:42:38.660 --> 01:42:39.700
what the fuck this bug is.

01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:41.220
I like bugs.

01:42:42.100 --> 01:42:43.700
This one's giving me weird vibes.

01:42:44.020 --> 01:42:45.620
He just shat on my window.

01:42:45.620 --> 01:42:46.420
Maybe he's a shit.

01:42:48.900 --> 01:42:49.620
Maybe in room.

01:42:51.540 --> 01:42:52.500
Don't want to tell me who he is.

01:42:52.500 --> 01:42:53.620
Oh, he just flew away.

01:42:53.620 --> 01:42:54.020
Fuck.

01:42:54.580 --> 01:42:56.180
No, I need to study you.

01:42:56.180 --> 01:42:58.020
Maybe we're new form of insects.

01:43:00.820 --> 01:43:02.020
What the hell?

01:43:02.020 --> 01:43:02.420
Okay.

01:43:06.660 --> 01:43:07.300
Elden ring.

01:43:09.060 --> 01:43:10.020
Oh, that's right.

01:43:10.020 --> 01:43:10.660
It released today.

01:43:11.300 --> 01:43:13.060
I have to mute Elden Ring then on my

01:43:14.340 --> 01:43:16.900
excuse me, on my stream.

01:43:16.900 --> 01:43:19.060
I mean, on my Twitter.

01:43:19.060 --> 01:43:19.940
Don't want any spoilers.

01:43:20.980 --> 01:43:22.260
Let me take a photo and ask AI.

01:43:22.260 --> 01:43:23.060
I took a photo.

01:43:26.740 --> 01:43:27.940
I was going to show it to you guys,

01:43:27.940 --> 01:43:30.020
but it would expose where I actually know.

01:43:30.020 --> 01:43:42.660
So, I zoom in, hit top, crop that, and crop, crop, crop it, crop these.

01:43:43.300 --> 01:43:44.100
Fucking load.

01:43:46.260 --> 01:43:46.980
69.

01:43:51.220 --> 01:43:51.540
Nice.

01:43:54.020 --> 01:43:55.220
I'll post it later.

01:43:55.220 --> 01:43:55.860
Wait, can I?

01:43:58.260 --> 01:43:59.140
Look up bug.

01:44:00.100 --> 01:44:02.740
Up here.

01:44:08.740 --> 01:44:09.460
That one just like that.

01:44:09.460 --> 01:44:10.820
Again this one.

01:44:14.180 --> 01:44:14.820
Born-tales.

01:44:15.140 --> 01:44:25.380
Yes.

01:44:27.220 --> 01:44:28.420
A little bit lighter in this whole here.

01:44:28.420 --> 01:44:32.420
lighter in the color. It's in body shape.

01:44:32.420 --> 01:44:40.420
I like knowing things.

01:44:58.420 --> 01:45:24.420
If you don't f**king like that I talk, then go home.

01:45:24.420 --> 01:45:30.420
You don't have to watch. You can click off to show off your computer and walk away bro.

01:45:30.420 --> 01:45:44.420
I feel like yapping. I feel like I haven't yapped. I don't know why it feels like I haven't streamed when I streamed recently.

01:45:44.420 --> 01:45:52.420
I'm eating my last airhead.

01:45:52.420 --> 01:46:08.420
They're mini airheads.

01:46:08.420 --> 01:46:16.420
I'm yapping some voices in my head.

01:46:16.420 --> 01:46:20.420
Yapping my heart's potential.

01:46:20.420 --> 01:46:26.420
I've been craving airheads lately so I got some.

01:46:26.420 --> 01:46:36.420
Usually I'm a gummy worm kind of gal, but they didn't have any of them.

01:46:36.420 --> 01:46:44.420
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:46:44.420 --> 01:46:58.420
I'm going on vacation. I'm going to leave you with this sh**.

01:46:58.420 --> 01:47:02.420
Thank you for becoming a member brother.

01:47:02.420 --> 01:47:10.420
I remember watching a video of somebody freeze drying those giant snake ones.

01:47:10.420 --> 01:47:14.420
I got some beef jerky. I also have some bueno.

01:47:14.420 --> 01:47:18.420
Oh wait, I guess I ate the bueno and I didn't remember. So that's a lie.

01:47:18.420 --> 01:47:24.420
I just have beef jerky next to me.

01:47:24.420 --> 01:47:28.420
You don't have a Twitter account?

01:47:28.420 --> 01:47:32.420
We give you so many f**king freebies on there.

01:47:32.420 --> 01:47:36.420
Because that's like us actually doing stuff.

01:47:36.420 --> 01:47:40.420
Whereas in the ASMR, well I don't know. Some of us might be actually doing stuff.

01:47:40.420 --> 01:47:44.420
But mostly the ASMR is just us recording the script.

01:47:44.420 --> 01:47:52.420
That's pure unfiltered real amateur audio on Twitter.

01:47:52.420 --> 01:47:56.420
It's not as she be streaming until she's an hour plus and so is the start of the game.

01:47:56.420 --> 01:48:00.420
Stop it! Stop!

01:48:00.420 --> 01:48:06.420
Stop complaining! Stop pointing it out!

01:48:06.420 --> 01:48:10.420
How do you learn how to growl?

01:48:10.420 --> 01:48:14.420
Whatever you do, don't eat the famous gamer gummy control.

01:48:14.420 --> 01:48:18.420
What is that? Almost said two hours. Now I'm going to yap for two hours.

01:48:18.420 --> 01:48:22.420

Don't want to spoil for anybody

02:01:34.780 --> 02:01:41.060
There's a character who talks when they're not supposed to and that character cracks me up

02:01:41.860 --> 02:01:43.860

I didn't I didn't um start the session either. So that's why you guys can't do anything yet

02:09:10.540 --> 02:09:15.980
It's not recognizing the game as a game. It doesn't even show up as a window, which is weird

02:10:18.460 --> 02:10:23.740
It was ready for just challenging. I don't have my headphones on because I don't like wearing my headphones unless I need them

02:10:24.220 --> 02:10:27.500
Because they hurt my ears. Any headphones are my ears. Oh the ear ones

02:10:34.700 --> 02:10:36.700

02:11:26.060 --> 02:11:33.340
Uh, Casey's mod is a longer version of the first phase of uh, inscription

02:11:35.980 --> 02:11:39.740

Nope, that's discord. I didn't mean to open that

02:11:51.340 --> 02:11:54.940

I always saw her as like a really butch lesbian

02:12:14.140 --> 02:12:16.140
It's a flat top romance

02:12:16.300 --> 02:12:18.140
hag voice

02:12:18.140 --> 02:12:20.380
There was a bit too long. I do agree. It was a bit too long

Deck building hard so I didn't like the second phase. Uh, yeah, I would like I like the second phase because I like the art style

02:12:43.980 --> 02:12:46.700
It was harder. I didn't mind the deck building too much

02:12:47.100 --> 02:12:49.100
um

02:12:49.500 --> 02:12:51.900
Do you mind if I examine those pelts of yours?

Let's start with your hair pelts here. Here's what I can offer

02:12:59.580 --> 02:13:01.580

With gently shaking hands she placed her offerings before you

02:14:25.820 --> 02:14:28.140
Uh, give me the rabbit one

02:14:30.140 --> 02:14:32.140
I love manipulating my rabbits

02:14:33.980 --> 02:14:36.700
The old woman collected her piece and shuffled off into the dock

02:14:36.860 --> 02:14:39.340
She doesn't say anything. So I'm just doing my narrator voice for her

02:14:40.460 --> 02:14:42.700
Oh, yeah, I would I spam or Boris really bad

02:14:46.540 --> 02:14:51.340

02:25:56.540 --> 02:25:59.740

02:26:08.780 --> 02:26:10.780
Excuse me

02:26:20.380 --> 02:26:22.380
Sounds like cow tipping

02:26:23.100 --> 02:26:26.300
Gotta put you in your place you right. Hey, we got a bat

02:26:26.860 --> 02:26:30.380
We got a raven egg and we got an alpha. I should have got that raven head

02:26:31.020 --> 02:26:35.260
Because then I would have actually no I can get the alpha because then I have the fuck of the wolf head

02:26:36.940 --> 02:26:38.940
Oh

02:26:41.180 --> 02:26:43.820
I'm gonna keep going to a carver

02:26:48.620 --> 02:26:53.820
You came across a small group survivors faces. I'm wondering if I should have just played the normal game

02:27:01.340 --> 02:27:03.340
Oh

02:27:03.660 --> 02:27:05.660
I might do that actually

02:27:11.180 --> 02:27:13.180
Whose help do I want to raise?

02:27:30.380 --> 02:27:32.380

I'm waiting for you guys to kill me

02:28:42.860 --> 02:28:47.020
Depending what you put on the top and the bottom the totem, I think I actually you know what

Two hours and 30 minutes in is the real game folks

02:29:25.020 --> 02:29:27.660
In the beginning the world did not know cars

02:29:29.980 --> 02:29:32.460
That is until the day the scrap weight

02:29:36.460 --> 02:29:39.980
This isn't even the this isn't the beginning. This is not the beginning

02:29:45.260 --> 02:29:47.260
This is not the beginning

02:29:50.060 --> 02:29:52.060

Yes, that's what I had to go back and um there was a chapter select

02:32:19.980 --> 02:32:21.980

So this because of this fucking thing

02:33:32.940 --> 02:33:35.020
Where'd the game go? Oh my god

02:33:36.700 --> 02:33:41.100
Maybe I had the right idea with just yapping

02:34:01.500 --> 02:34:05.180
I love this game and I really just wanted to show it to everybody and it's not even loading

02:34:06.460 --> 02:34:12.060
Okay, I looks like I have to do a fucking display capture which I hate doing

02:34:17.180 --> 02:34:19.180
Whoa

02:34:19.180 --> 02:34:21.180
What the

02:34:34.380 --> 02:34:41.180
Dude that was I wish you guys could see the lightning that was just out my fucking window

02:34:43.660 --> 02:34:45.660
That was thunder

02:34:46.620 --> 02:34:51.100
And because it happens so fast it's definitely like you know if you know um

02:34:52.300 --> 02:34:55.180
You can measure like the distance is like the storm is away

02:34:55.900 --> 02:34:57.500
Oh my god

02:34:57.500 --> 02:34:59.500
The dark cloud

02:34:59.500 --> 02:35:03.500
Oh, yeah, I'm like it has to be like a mile away because I was so fast. It's like a second

02:35:04.220 --> 02:35:08.780
If like if lightning hit strikes and then you wait you count the seconds

02:35:08.780 --> 02:35:13.100
That's how many miles away the storm is and it was like a second after and then I look on my window

02:35:13.180 --> 02:35:15.660
In there the darkest clouds I've ever seen in my fucking life

02:35:17.020 --> 02:35:19.020
And my cat freaked out

02:35:20.860 --> 02:35:22.860
Um

02:35:24.620 --> 02:35:26.620
Baby are you okay?

02:35:27.340 --> 02:35:29.340
Hmm

02:35:39.660 --> 02:35:46.540
I think it's a scaredy cat so I have I just want to make sure you just let me get some water

02:35:50.140 --> 02:35:52.140
That was intense

02:35:52.300 --> 02:35:58.300
That was that was crazy what the fuck oh man

02:36:00.940 --> 02:36:06.460
So it's something in your vicinity on fire now because oh no no no just because lightning strikes doesn't mean something's gonna be on fire

02:36:08.940 --> 02:36:10.940
It just it just flashed

02:36:10.940 --> 02:36:12.940
I

02:36:19.020 --> 02:36:21.020
The best

02:36:29.260 --> 02:36:34.700
Last time I streamed inscription it went perfectly fine, so I don't know why the fuck this is doing this

02:36:35.660 --> 02:36:37.660
Stepping on litter

02:36:37.660 --> 02:36:39.660
My favorite thing to do

02:36:41.900 --> 02:36:46.380
She me must now I'm wondering if I should actually like

02:36:47.420 --> 02:36:49.420
Wow those clouds are

02:36:49.820 --> 02:36:51.820
moving so fast

02:36:52.060 --> 02:36:56.940
Um, it's supposed to like thunder. I think tonight. I thought actually I thought it was supposed to be tomorrow

02:36:57.500 --> 02:37:02.860
I'm wondering if it's safe for me to stream at all like streaming during a storm because I don't want to like if there's a power surge or some

02:37:02.860 --> 02:37:03.900
shit

02:37:03.900 --> 02:37:05.900
A guy in my village got struck by

02:37:06.780 --> 02:37:08.780
your village

02:37:08.940 --> 02:37:14.700
Anyways got struck by lightning while stood outside his house because he was holding a kitchen knife. You're the window. That's terrifying

02:37:15.980 --> 02:37:17.980
No

02:37:29.420 --> 02:37:31.420
Wait, what if I do this?

02:37:36.540 --> 02:37:38.380
Oh

02:37:38.380 --> 02:37:40.380
Okay

02:37:45.420 --> 02:37:47.580
I might cut the vod

02:37:49.180 --> 02:37:51.180
No, I'm kidding

02:37:56.540 --> 02:37:58.540
I'm only gonna play the first phase

02:37:59.820 --> 02:38:02.460
The first I'm only playing the first act. I'm not playing the whole game

02:38:08.380 --> 02:38:10.380
I

02:38:24.540 --> 02:38:26.540
Another challenger

02:38:29.660 --> 02:38:34.300
Yeah, no, I'm sorry. I'm overriding. I'm overriding the mandem voice. We're gonna do the lolly voice

02:38:39.260 --> 02:38:42.380
Another challenger. It's been ages

02:38:45.020 --> 02:38:47.660
Perhaps you have forgotten how this game is played

02:38:48.940 --> 02:38:50.940
Allow me to remind you

02:38:55.260 --> 02:38:58.380

02:39:04.620 --> 02:39:06.620
Oh

02:39:07.180 --> 02:39:09.180
I didn't catch that

02:39:09.980 --> 02:39:18.060
Wolves require two sacrifices. You don't have enough bring the bell to end your turn in commence combat

02:39:22.300 --> 02:39:29.020
Your stote stands on the post the number on the bottom left is attack power one

02:39:33.660 --> 02:39:37.180
Your stote don't mean one damage. I added it to the scale

02:39:37.740 --> 02:39:40.140
It's getting really fucking dark outside

02:39:40.780 --> 02:39:44.620
If you win you win if you tip my side all the way down

02:39:48.540 --> 02:39:50.540
Like this

02:39:51.420 --> 02:39:53.420
My turn

02:39:54.300 --> 02:39:56.300
Yes, we just started playing

02:39:57.260 --> 02:40:00.380
Okay, a little pookie bear is a Greek

02:40:00.620 --> 02:40:02.620
Coach

02:40:02.940 --> 02:40:04.940
Stoats annoying as fuck

02:40:05.420 --> 02:40:07.920
Your stote stands in the way of my coyote

02:40:09.580 --> 02:40:12.060
My coyote dealt two damage to your stote

02:40:13.100 --> 02:40:15.260
That means your stote's health is now too less

02:40:16.140 --> 02:40:19.260
If a creature's health reaches zero it dies

02:40:21.020 --> 02:40:23.020
It's your turn again

02:40:23.580 --> 02:40:26.860
You may draw from your deck or you may draw a squirrel

02:40:27.580 --> 02:40:29.580
Oh

02:40:29.820 --> 02:40:31.820
How dull

02:40:33.100 --> 02:40:35.100
Well

02:40:37.260 --> 02:40:39.260
Wolves demand two sacrifices

02:40:41.980 --> 02:40:45.980
I thought I turned off crowd control

02:40:49.820 --> 02:40:51.820
I guess I didn't

02:40:54.140 --> 02:40:56.140
How did that even happen?

02:40:56.380 --> 02:41:00.220
I closed the fuck I literally closed hold on

02:41:04.940 --> 02:41:09.500
Oh, it literally says are you sure I didn't click yes

02:41:11.580 --> 02:41:13.660
No, we'll keep it open. We'll keep it open

02:41:15.420 --> 02:41:17.420
What is how oh my god

02:41:19.100 --> 02:41:23.980
Fear not the beat is to sacrifice but not removed from your deck

02:41:24.940 --> 02:41:31.100
Don't break the tutorial guys. It's suffering was real, but you'll see it again

02:41:37.100 --> 02:41:39.100
Uh

02:41:42.460 --> 02:41:46.940
That was a good game four damage dealt four weights on the scale

02:41:49.580 --> 02:41:51.580
You've won this match

02:41:52.300 --> 02:41:54.300
They won't all be so easy

02:41:57.660 --> 02:41:59.660
Let me recall your story

02:42:01.660 --> 02:42:03.660
Oh, yes

02:42:05.260 --> 02:42:10.060
You were lost deep in the forest a single path revealed itself

02:42:16.300 --> 02:42:19.660
I was making dinner. Why did she turn it off? Uh, I didn't turn it off

02:42:20.140 --> 02:42:26.300
I'll repost actually, you know, I don't know if some of you guys still have crowd control open, but I'll repost the link

02:42:30.780 --> 02:42:35.420
You guys break the tutorial then you break the tutorial I guess there's nothing I could fucking do about it

02:42:38.620 --> 02:42:40.620
Enjoy you fucking hooligans

02:42:41.580 --> 02:42:43.580
Oh

02:42:55.740 --> 02:43:01.020
Give me the fucking cat give you the cat another creature joins your caravan

02:43:05.260 --> 02:43:08.380
Some of the creatures of the forest seemed willing to follow you

02:43:11.020 --> 02:43:16.860
You came across an abandoned sack a ball sack if you will

02:43:18.540 --> 02:43:23.740
You found a squirrel in a bottle break in case of emergency and have a second

02:43:25.580 --> 02:43:29.260
Another useful implement I'll allow you to tip the scales

02:43:31.420 --> 02:43:34.380
Three is as much as you can carry all that lightning

02:43:34.940 --> 02:43:36.940
You

02:43:39.820 --> 02:43:41.820
Guys if I die will you remember me?

02:43:54.540 --> 02:43:56.540
Can you hear the thunder

02:43:56.940 --> 02:44:01.500
Thunder he the thunder whoa

02:44:02.460 --> 02:44:04.460
It's so funny because only like one

02:44:05.180 --> 02:44:07.980
Like the storm the cloud is passing in front of my house

02:44:08.700 --> 02:44:10.700
my apartment and only

02:44:13.820 --> 02:44:15.820
Only one

02:44:16.300 --> 02:44:21.740
It's like half I could see the rain, but it's not on my half. It's like a wall

02:44:22.700 --> 02:44:27.420
Of water is and I just saw lightning clear as fuck that was cool

02:44:28.540 --> 02:44:32.380
I've seen have you ever I've seen green in red lightning before

02:44:36.140 --> 02:44:38.140
That was interesting I love thunder

02:44:40.620 --> 02:44:45.180
Your narration always has to be doing double tape and it's actually happening. That's a thing. Yeah

02:44:47.740 --> 02:44:50.380
You're ambushed while crossing some rough terrain

02:44:51.180 --> 02:44:55.180
By a boulder, but it's not a boulder. It's a rock

02:44:58.060 --> 02:45:04.380
I get it. Maybe you'll help me take your turn play along for now

02:45:06.380 --> 02:45:08.380
You may now see my moves ahead of time

02:45:09.820 --> 02:45:12.460
All right, I will sacrifice your care

02:45:14.060 --> 02:45:16.060
Or let me just put this show down

02:45:17.580 --> 02:45:19.580
Here we go

02:45:20.540 --> 02:45:22.540
All right, I can't really fucking do anything else

02:45:27.420 --> 02:45:30.540
Mind the ambitious wolf cub it ain't just swiftly

02:45:32.460 --> 02:45:36.140
A rock lobster it's it's iraq

02:45:44.300 --> 02:45:48.140
I'm just gonna do that boulder just attack

02:45:48.940 --> 02:45:58.140
Did you guys give give power to my boulder? I should get turn the game volume down. Okay

02:46:04.700 --> 02:46:11.500
That boulder just crushed that little dog that's sad the airborne bat flies over creatures to attack directly

02:46:12.060 --> 02:46:14.060
No

02:46:15.100 --> 02:46:19.100
My bat flew right over your stote. It is really fucking dark outside

02:46:19.500 --> 02:46:24.540
Even darker than how I am in the darkness right now with my spinny little fucking eyes

02:46:27.020 --> 02:46:32.940
I don't think I'm gonna squirrel show mine if I fuck you with your fucking mantis

02:46:35.260 --> 02:46:37.260
I say what you did

02:46:37.340 --> 02:46:39.340
I

02:46:39.580 --> 02:46:41.580
Why is this stomp deadly?

02:46:52.780 --> 02:46:56.300
Get absolutely fuck you fuck um

02:46:58.220 --> 02:47:00.220
I was gonna say something bad

02:47:02.140 --> 02:47:05.100
Not what you thought not not what you thought I was gonna say

02:47:07.740 --> 02:47:10.780
Wait the boulder got stronger. Yeah, somebody somebody uh

02:47:12.540 --> 02:47:17.900
Gave the boulder more power you profound and tripped onwards past the now bloody terrain

02:47:18.860 --> 02:47:26.300
No, I wasn't gonna say the gamer word. I was gonna say you fuck wad but swap wad with something else

02:47:29.900 --> 02:47:31.500
She'd be based

02:47:31.500 --> 02:47:33.500
Whoa, she'd be based

02:47:33.900 --> 02:47:38.780
The young wolf cub it grows into a wolf after a single turn. Okay. I don't really need to narrate for that

02:47:39.340 --> 02:47:41.340
Uh, I'll take the wolf

02:47:45.900 --> 02:47:48.540
I'm usually a great refresher before more elven ring. Oh

02:47:49.420 --> 02:47:52.940
Oh, have some of you baby girls listening to my audio

02:47:55.900 --> 02:47:57.900
Swamp bog

02:47:59.580 --> 02:48:01.580
Oh, it's raining

02:48:02.300 --> 02:48:08.300
It's raining though. Oh, hold on. I'm gonna open my I'm gonna open my balcony so you guys can hear

02:48:13.820 --> 02:48:15.820
I'm not wearing pants

02:48:31.580 --> 02:48:34.300
So

02:49:01.580 --> 02:49:03.580

02:49:10.380 --> 02:49:12.380
The day some are right there

02:49:15.420 --> 02:49:17.420
I don't know if it's actually getting like

02:49:18.620 --> 02:49:20.620
Cheat

02:49:20.940 --> 02:49:23.900
Play by my mic if you can't even hear it

02:49:24.860 --> 02:49:26.860
I

02:49:29.820 --> 02:49:31.820
It's patient ash I

02:49:32.860 --> 02:49:35.660
Madam makes you stand in the rain and lightning hits you

02:49:41.420 --> 02:49:48.860
I mean if I turn off the audio here, I got you watch this watch this

02:49:53.900 --> 02:49:55.900
I

02:50:41.420 --> 02:50:44.940
Thank you for the $10 dark up and you're joining the stream

02:50:46.700 --> 02:50:52.380
I'm glad you're enjoying it. Thank you for coming. I think I always love it when there's new people and they're just like, uh

02:50:53.020 --> 02:50:55.020
Hello

02:51:12.940 --> 02:51:17.340
Kind of want a bowl of cereal I'm feeling snacky. It looks snacking

02:51:17.980 --> 02:51:19.980
I

02:51:21.740 --> 02:51:25.340
Love storms. I love like I usually fall asleep listening to the funder

02:51:32.780 --> 02:51:35.900
Yeah, sometimes you like I don't like it when you can tell where the loop part is

02:51:36.780 --> 02:51:43.740
That's my fave cereal. Um, my favorite cereal is post-it o's. They used to be quaker o's, but they were bought by post

02:51:44.140 --> 02:51:46.140
Those are my favorite

02:51:48.300 --> 02:51:50.300
Oh, wait, I muted the game

02:51:54.540 --> 02:51:57.180
You know like storms be like windy days interesting

02:51:58.700 --> 02:52:05.580
Brain sounds knock me out. You love those too. No way 56 year old taste was it's funny because of my my my meh-meh

02:52:06.860 --> 02:52:12.380
My grandmother my grandma loves those and that's why I started eating them because normally I just have Cheerios

02:52:13.020 --> 02:52:16.060
Guys, I wish I could show you outside. It's so gorgeous

02:52:17.420 --> 02:52:19.420
with a rail

02:52:20.940 --> 02:52:24.300
I felt that thunder in my fucking skull. That was crazy

02:52:27.660 --> 02:52:31.180
The fuck is wrong. This is a perfect night to watch a horror movie

02:52:32.780 --> 02:52:35.660
I never heard of anyone else in my serenity me too. I never hear it

02:52:38.860 --> 02:52:44.940
Okay, you stumbled onto some strange. I'm so distracted. I can't focus on the fucking game. I just want to get

02:52:47.580 --> 02:52:53.660
You were compelled to choose a worthy sacrifice one will be lost forever. All right, who am I sacrificing?

02:52:54.940 --> 02:52:56.940
Uh

02:52:57.340 --> 02:52:59.340
Okay

02:53:03.260 --> 02:53:05.180
Well, I could

02:53:05.180 --> 02:53:09.100
Because it wants me to take that thing because it what it wants me to do the sigil

02:53:10.220 --> 02:53:12.220
I don't want to

02:53:13.260 --> 02:53:16.860
You know my strat when playing this game was I get the sigil of the cat

02:53:17.980 --> 02:53:19.980
Um on the totem

02:53:20.220 --> 02:53:24.700
And then the squirrel so every time I killed a squirrel and just returned to my hand and it was fucking awesome

02:53:25.100 --> 02:53:27.100
Um, but I'll do

02:53:27.580 --> 02:53:30.780
That thank you. What the fuck are you gonna turn into?

02:53:31.740 --> 02:53:33.740
Sure

02:53:36.300 --> 02:53:38.300
Cat stronger

02:53:40.300 --> 02:53:44.300
I gasly spectacle but the soul of the wolf cub now lives in the stout

02:53:48.300 --> 02:53:50.300
So

02:53:52.940 --> 02:53:57.740
This is a totem fight so all their canine related cards are gonna be flying

02:54:01.980 --> 02:54:08.860
He's completely insane you see that right no care for the wolf camera the voice is fucking in pathetic really that's what it was

02:54:09.900 --> 02:54:14.380
Only keeps me around to watch me suffer. I usually give him like a like a nerdy voice

02:54:15.340 --> 02:54:17.340
And then fucking health

02:54:18.940 --> 02:54:23.340
Why do you change the costs on that one? Uh, well have fun

02:54:25.900 --> 02:54:27.900
Well, they're they're literally just gonna fly

Oh, give me a strange larva. Fuck. Yeah, brother. Oh, uh, okay

02:54:54.940 --> 02:54:56.940
Let me uh play something

02:54:56.940 --> 02:54:58.940
I guess

02:55:11.820 --> 02:55:14.220
My spiff tree have powers

02:55:15.980 --> 02:55:17.980
You're one damn a joy from winning

02:55:18.780 --> 02:55:24.620
You're one damn joy from winning. You're gonna win. You're one damn joy from winning

02:55:27.820 --> 02:55:29.820
Sorry

Hey, oh leshy is kind of excited

02:55:57.900 --> 02:56:02.140
Yeah, strong trees

Impressive you may yet survive this ordeal

02:56:12.940 --> 02:56:14.940
Knock on wood

02:56:21.740 --> 02:56:23.740
Okay

02:56:24.460 --> 02:56:30.140
Okay, I'll get some flight

02:56:34.540 --> 02:56:39.340
Uh, I don't really need to sack her. Well, actually I might make somebody airborne

02:56:42.220 --> 02:56:50.460
If that voice is how they're leshy, um, I'm gonna sack my sparrow. I'm gonna make the cat fly. No, I'll make the one of the wolves fly

02:56:54.700 --> 02:56:56.700
It should be I'm trying to maintain composure

02:56:57.260 --> 02:57:02.460
I'm out composure. You're gonna be composing me. You don't have to be composed

02:57:05.980 --> 02:57:07.980
I want you to lose all composure

02:57:10.140 --> 02:57:16.060
There's a way out for both of us is somewhere in this file cabin be silent or I will tear you to shreds

02:57:16.780 --> 02:57:18.780
Uh

02:57:19.420 --> 02:57:24.380
Square road and then we uh square road and then we uh

02:57:37.420 --> 02:57:39.420
Put a fucking grizzly

Oh wait, is this the one that I'm supposed to lose? I can't remember

02:57:43.980 --> 02:57:45.980
I think so

02:57:46.540 --> 02:57:48.540
He's power player board

02:57:49.820 --> 02:57:54.620
He gets angry if you beat him though for this one because you're not supposed to beat him

02:57:59.500 --> 02:58:01.500
You've lost

02:58:01.820 --> 02:58:06.140
Using this as a learning opportunity may be the only way to mitigate my disappointment

02:58:07.740 --> 02:58:09.740
Get up

02:58:10.540 --> 02:58:12.540
I want you to kiss my feet

02:58:13.580 --> 02:58:15.580

You think you're better than me, don't you you're wrong

02:58:23.660 --> 02:58:28.940
I've always been better than you that's why you grovel before my little feet

02:58:39.740 --> 02:58:41.740
Huh

02:58:42.540 --> 02:58:44.540

Come lick my toes

02:58:49.020 --> 02:58:54.460
Batch me that the candle stick from on top of the barrel beside the door. I'm British now

02:59:00.060 --> 02:59:03.580
Give me a smoke you want some smoke then you want some smoke

02:59:05.820 --> 02:59:10.460
Oh my god, my cat just scared me. She just brushed against my foot. Jesus Christ

02:59:11.740 --> 02:59:13.740
Let me out. Let me out

02:59:16.700 --> 02:59:19.100
Bring in here be a good dog

02:59:25.260 --> 02:59:34.060
This fucking little hand boy tipped one dollar. No, she spanks you if you lose. Well, she spanks you if you lose. Thank you, boy

02:59:36.300 --> 02:59:39.420
Now sit back down good dog

02:59:41.820 --> 02:59:43.820
Freaky leashy

02:59:45.580 --> 02:59:49.900
Small Victorian child she be cotton ton not cotton bum cotton ton

02:59:54.700 --> 02:59:56.940
Let me explain something to you

02:59:59.820 --> 03:00:01.820
You can't make me lose

03:00:02.940 --> 03:00:06.940
That was one of the two mistakes you can make here is thinking

03:00:07.900 --> 03:00:11.420
Now you have some sort of power over me

03:00:13.180 --> 03:00:17.100
If you make another I'm going to have to hurt you here. Um

03:00:18.700 --> 03:00:20.700
Now where are we?

03:00:23.740 --> 03:00:25.740
Uh, all right then

03:00:27.180 --> 03:00:29.420
Actually, fuck no, I should have gone to see what was in the pack

03:00:30.060 --> 03:00:32.940
Sparrow adder raven. Uh, I want the adder

03:00:34.300 --> 03:00:36.300
Just because

03:00:37.420 --> 03:00:39.420
I like the sigil

03:00:42.940 --> 03:00:45.500
You came across a small group of survivors

03:00:46.460 --> 03:00:47.580
Oh

03:00:47.580 --> 03:00:51.100
Imagine being surrounded by five hair members

03:00:52.060 --> 03:00:54.060
I don't know what I would do

03:00:54.300 --> 03:00:55.420
just a

03:00:55.420 --> 03:00:56.780
small

03:00:56.780 --> 03:00:58.780
offenses girl

03:00:58.780 --> 03:01:00.780
I

03:01:02.380 --> 03:01:04.380
Wouldn't have any way to protect myself

03:01:05.180 --> 03:01:08.940
Priests shrunk them from starvation. They huddled around the campfire

03:01:09.820 --> 03:01:12.380
They looked upon the group of creatures and beckoned

03:01:14.620 --> 03:01:18.220
Come warm winning your creatures by the fire once said

03:01:19.820 --> 03:01:24.380
Warming by the fire that will enhance its power said another

03:01:25.100 --> 03:01:31.260
You know just one of the survivors who I've been drool from their mouth. Where was it something else?

03:01:32.780 --> 03:01:34.780
Like come

03:01:39.260 --> 03:01:41.260
Everybody's so quiet

03:01:42.140 --> 03:01:46.140
I'm looking at chat and nobody is fucking talking

03:01:47.340 --> 03:01:51.820
Because you fuckers. What are you doing? Please stop. I'm shopping

03:01:52.620 --> 03:01:54.620
You're at the moment

03:02:03.020 --> 03:02:09.340
He's too busy. All right, let me continue then continue continue. Don't stop. Don't stop

03:02:13.020 --> 03:02:15.020
I'm gonna make my cat strong

03:02:15.420 --> 03:02:17.420
Because I need to sacrifice it

03:02:21.820 --> 03:02:24.140
One of the survivors reached towards me

03:02:25.740 --> 03:02:29.740
You're not allowed to touch me dirty piece of trash. I told it

03:02:31.020 --> 03:02:33.020
My mother gnashed its teeth

03:02:33.900 --> 03:02:35.900
tugging on my skirt

03:02:36.540 --> 03:02:38.540
Without a word I pulled it away

03:02:39.420 --> 03:02:41.420
and left

03:02:41.420 --> 03:02:43.420
I

03:02:44.940 --> 03:02:49.500
Listen to your beautiful. Uhu story. It's like I'm focused just to join

03:02:59.820 --> 03:03:04.300
The trees seem to close in around you as a chill mist ascended

03:03:06.380 --> 03:03:11.100
In the distance you could hear the clinking of metal and stone

03:03:12.380 --> 03:03:14.380
As I change you up

03:03:14.460 --> 03:03:16.460
and bound you

03:03:16.860 --> 03:03:18.860
Stuffing my panties in your mouth

03:03:20.060 --> 03:03:22.060
Gagging you

03:03:22.060 --> 03:03:24.060
You can't escape

03:03:24.700 --> 03:03:26.700
You're mine now

03:03:27.180 --> 03:03:29.180
And I will join the pet

03:03:42.060 --> 03:03:44.060
Okay

03:03:48.220 --> 03:03:50.220
Go on

03:03:52.220 --> 03:03:54.220
A figure stood in your back

03:03:57.900 --> 03:03:59.900
He was the crossfactor

03:04:05.660 --> 03:04:07.660
Stop I want you to stop

03:04:09.100 --> 03:04:11.100
No touchy no touchy

03:04:11.580 --> 03:04:13.580
I don't know why I have to look at that

03:04:16.860 --> 03:04:18.860
Um

03:04:24.460 --> 03:04:30.460
You motherfucker you motherfucker fuck your mother motherfucker

03:04:33.420 --> 03:04:39.980
I want a gold digger. I ain't saying she a gold digger if she ain't messing with no broke broke

03:04:41.980 --> 03:04:46.380
Did I neglect to mention overkill damage?

03:04:49.100 --> 03:04:52.460
That's when you're tied up so tightly

03:04:54.140 --> 03:04:56.140
Bound back

03:04:57.820 --> 03:05:01.420
Brisk burning from the friction of the metal

03:05:04.380 --> 03:05:07.660
You start to lie. You can't escape

03:05:08.540 --> 03:05:12.540
I don't waste any damage

03:05:15.740 --> 03:05:17.740
You create in your neck

03:05:18.860 --> 03:05:25.260
And I press my little tiny heel to your throat

03:05:27.660 --> 03:05:29.660
Try to breathe now

03:05:37.660 --> 03:05:39.660
I

03:06:03.580 --> 03:06:05.580
Freaky prospecting

03:06:08.620 --> 03:06:14.620
You can't spend easy verses than lunch. Yes, I can

03:06:24.860 --> 03:06:26.860
Can't fucking do anything

03:06:32.860 --> 03:06:36.220
I hope you didn't think it would be that easy to escape me now

03:06:37.180 --> 03:06:39.180
Did you

03:06:42.780 --> 03:06:44.780
I'll let this step on your balls next

03:06:47.340 --> 03:06:53.900
How does it make you feel knowing that a little girl is stomping on your nuts

03:07:02.620 --> 03:07:04.620
There's golden cards

03:07:06.620 --> 03:07:08.620
I

03:07:12.700 --> 03:07:14.700
Gold I've struck gold

03:07:20.620 --> 03:07:25.500
Don't worry about it you just give him a wolf you fucking bitch

03:07:27.980 --> 03:07:34.540
You fucking cunts you fucking concier you don't matter

03:07:36.220 --> 03:07:38.220
I

03:07:51.820 --> 03:07:54.220
Serpent perhaps more deadly than man

03:08:00.220 --> 03:08:02.220
They strangle

03:08:03.260 --> 03:08:05.260
They choke

03:08:05.980 --> 03:08:10.460
Which is what you're experiencing right now as I'm stepping on your throat

03:08:20.860 --> 03:08:24.220
The cat's supposed to return from my hand so I don't know what happened with that

03:08:35.260 --> 03:08:37.260
All right

03:08:48.700 --> 03:08:50.700
Let's fucking go

03:08:52.940 --> 03:08:57.980
This cat returns of sacrifice that time I just got molded and that's a good point

03:08:59.660 --> 03:09:04.060
Allow me to let your candles once more. I won't be killing you quite yet

03:09:05.500 --> 03:09:16.220
You're the first in a while to overcome a boss like me as a reward

03:09:18.620 --> 03:09:20.620
I'll let you sniff my cunny

03:09:26.940 --> 03:09:30.700
Here I mean your granted opportunity to select a rare card

03:09:31.660 --> 03:09:38.780
That's what I said. What are you talking about? I said select a rare card. I said select a rare card

03:09:40.220 --> 03:09:45.900
Guys, I don't know what the fuck you thought you heard, but it was incorrect. Choose carefully

03:09:46.060 --> 03:09:48.060
I

03:09:56.060 --> 03:09:58.060
Gek

03:10:01.180 --> 03:10:03.180
I like the Gek because I can just like

03:10:04.460 --> 03:10:06.460
A strange law is good too

03:10:16.780 --> 03:10:18.780
I

03:10:19.180 --> 03:10:21.180
Free monies

03:10:22.700 --> 03:10:25.820
Hundred geck's even it's gacky joy

03:10:27.580 --> 03:10:33.980
It's gacky joy. It's fine. What are you talking about? What's the matter? It's fine. It's fine

03:10:35.820 --> 03:10:38.460
It's fine. Everybody relax

03:10:38.940 --> 03:10:40.940
Hmm

03:10:43.740 --> 03:10:48.300
The rink smell of rot and mold permeated the human air

03:10:49.820 --> 03:10:54.380
Every step forward was answered by some nearby slippers

03:10:56.780 --> 03:10:58.780
You tread cautiously into

03:11:00.460 --> 03:11:02.460
The wetlands

03:11:03.020 --> 03:11:05.020
You know what also is a wetland

03:11:09.260 --> 03:11:11.260
I

03:11:15.020 --> 03:11:21.740
Haven't seen the my colopis is the mycologist yet. So I fucking hate the bullfrog. Um

03:11:22.940 --> 03:11:24.940
But it is good against defense

03:11:26.700 --> 03:11:28.380
Or I can make a

03:11:28.380 --> 03:11:33.180
Actually, I'll get a river snapper because then I can see the mycologists and put them together

03:11:33.660 --> 03:11:37.820
Uh, I can't tell what that's up. Okay. No, that's the

03:11:38.700 --> 03:11:40.700
Thing you can use to mix stuff

03:11:42.300 --> 03:11:45.980
And that's the actually I would like that. Yeah

03:11:48.860 --> 03:11:53.740
Not gynecologist the mycologists are like mycology is study of mushrooms

03:11:54.620 --> 03:11:56.140
um

03:11:56.140 --> 03:12:00.780
I'm gonna sacrifice the adder and the gack is gonna get it

03:12:05.260 --> 03:12:07.660
Anything that touches the gack dies

03:12:09.420 --> 03:12:11.740
The study of yes, the study of my

03:12:18.860 --> 03:12:20.860
Stop with the fucking first

03:12:24.700 --> 03:12:27.660
Oh my god, the fucking Jesus

03:12:31.340 --> 03:12:33.340
Bees

03:12:38.460 --> 03:12:45.900
Oh god, these furs are actually kind of helping me out

03:12:50.860 --> 03:12:56.620
Oh, oh nice fucking try adding a fucking grizzly ha ha ha

03:12:59.180 --> 03:13:03.100
So, you know a mushroom expert in the game you fuck Jesus

03:13:03.100 --> 03:13:08.540
You can merge together cards with the mycologists

03:13:10.620 --> 03:13:14.460
The inviolable beehive when it's attacked you will drop me

03:13:15.580 --> 03:13:19.660
A sparrow herbal frog. I'll get the look at the the beehive

03:13:21.020 --> 03:13:23.020
Beehive

03:13:23.820 --> 03:13:26.620
Was popping brand new web just hopped in

03:13:27.580 --> 03:13:29.580
Uh

03:13:31.100 --> 03:13:33.100
We'll give it to the wolf

03:13:33.340 --> 03:13:38.540
If the wolf gets actually know if the river snapper gets attacked because that's six

03:13:38.700 --> 03:13:42.140
So that means you can take six hits so I can at least get six bees

03:13:44.540 --> 03:13:46.540
Bees brother

03:13:49.420 --> 03:13:53.260
Be confusing chat with this one. Hello and goodbye beehive

03:14:58.460 --> 03:15:00.960
He's the reforestation efforts

03:15:01.920 --> 03:15:12.080
Who's who's who's nerd who's putting it was like beefing my cards up right now beefing up my furs

Thank you for the grizzly who wears what does the fuck is a spider?

03:15:23.680 --> 03:15:25.680
Wait, oh, I don't god

03:15:27.280 --> 03:15:29.280
I can't

03:15:29.440 --> 03:15:37.280
I never noticed a spider in the game before well looks like I'm just gonna kill with this fur

03:15:41.440 --> 03:15:43.440
This is fun

03:15:47.040 --> 03:15:49.040
I like this is this is a great game

03:15:53.200 --> 03:15:55.840
Don't get ahead of yourself. Okay use that

03:15:56.720 --> 03:15:58.720
And

03:16:05.600 --> 03:16:08.480

I might get fucked a little bit. I'll see what the fuck is this

03:16:26.720 --> 03:16:28.720
Huh

03:16:34.000 --> 03:16:37.360
The hell I didn't even know that card could show up

03:16:39.600 --> 03:16:41.600
That's so weird

03:16:49.840 --> 03:16:51.840
Uh-oh

03:16:52.560 --> 03:16:54.560

Okay, I'm gonna squirrel that just to block anything. It's fine

We're good. We're good. He's gonna die. That's okay. That's okay. Fresh point

03:17:18.640 --> 03:17:20.640

Yo, she got the card don't underestimate

03:17:26.080 --> 03:17:28.080
How brutal of you

03:17:29.040 --> 03:17:31.680
You dealt me more damage than you needed to win

03:17:33.200 --> 03:17:36.880
However, in my game such feats are rewarded

03:17:38.480 --> 03:17:40.480
I like pain

03:17:41.200 --> 03:17:46.000
To be precise a tooth to keep for each extra damage dealt

03:17:47.200 --> 03:17:50.080
A trapper may be interested in your spoils

03:17:55.840 --> 03:17:59.280
Get clapped freak she

03:18:01.520 --> 03:18:05.120
You were stopped along the way by a trapper looking to liquidate his pelts

03:18:05.920 --> 03:18:10.160
There was something uncanny about his appearance, but you were quickly distracted by his ways

03:18:12.160 --> 03:18:14.160
Care to log out to my pelts

03:18:16.560 --> 03:18:20.480
Uh take a pelt for your charge. Holy shit

03:18:22.080 --> 03:18:24.080
Okay, uh you wink

03:18:24.800 --> 03:18:27.680
See the quality see the quality

03:18:28.800 --> 03:18:30.800
I can't do it or

An accent right now. Why is it only saying I can

03:18:36.160 --> 03:18:39.360
Wait one two, can I buy this? Oh, I can

03:18:41.840 --> 03:18:49.120
You you're leaving already, please consider me pelts. I don't have any more money. Why are you fucking asking me?

03:18:51.040 --> 03:18:53.040
Can I please leave

03:18:53.920 --> 03:18:58.720
For thanks for your business did you pelt top rate?

03:19:02.480 --> 03:19:04.480
Yeah, you just likes to roleplay

03:19:04.960 --> 03:19:07.280
The man I showed you of the value of the pelts

03:19:08.480 --> 03:19:12.640
They appear to be useless and fine. Oh wait, sorry, but he mentioned because I realized

03:19:13.200 --> 03:19:16.000
Unless she's talking right now you can see him when you can't see him

03:19:16.880 --> 03:19:18.880
That's when yeah, you know

03:19:19.600 --> 03:19:23.440

03:19:35.760 --> 03:19:37.760
I want to be a hundred yucks

03:19:38.960 --> 03:19:43.280
A group of starving survivors stood around the dying campfire

03:19:44.560 --> 03:19:46.560
Dying to sniff this

03:19:49.120 --> 03:19:53.440
Delicious smore there is room for a creature on the fire

03:19:56.160 --> 03:19:58.160
The warmth will enhance its powers

03:20:00.720 --> 03:20:05.760
When the survivors are nothing at all they could not stop licking there

03:20:19.120 --> 03:20:21.120
Oh

03:21:05.360 --> 03:21:07.360
A thousand cats

03:21:09.440 --> 03:21:12.640
She cannot be trusted with voicing regular dialogue

03:21:13.440 --> 03:21:15.440
She

03:21:18.480 --> 03:21:20.480
Be sweet

03:21:21.360 --> 03:21:25.840
You encountered a small outpost in the woods tempted by a mysterious woman

03:21:27.200 --> 03:21:29.200
It was a trick

03:21:29.680 --> 03:21:34.160

Okay, I gotta kill this child. How many times I feel like I have to kill this child

03:23:12.400 --> 03:23:18.080
I'm gonna sacrifice this child. We gotta fuck this child because I was referencing that card

03:23:18.720 --> 03:23:22.000
And if you weren't like, huh, I don't think we're when they weren't listening

03:23:27.280 --> 03:23:29.280

03:24:08.480 --> 03:24:10.480
Oh

03:24:18.560 --> 03:24:22.080
My boss battles are high stakes tests of your aptitude

03:24:23.920 --> 03:24:27.200
As for intelligence you seem to be doing well without

03:24:28.800 --> 03:24:32.720
I just called you an idiot. He what are you gonna do about it?

03:24:33.680 --> 03:24:35.680
Nothing

03:24:36.560 --> 03:24:39.360
Because you're a little pathetic whiny bitch

03:24:42.320 --> 03:24:44.880
With one flame you'll either overcome them or die

03:24:46.000 --> 03:24:48.000
Do you want to die?

03:24:48.480 --> 03:24:53.840
I can string you up and pull you apart like one of my favorite dolls

03:24:56.000 --> 03:25:02.080

03:25:05.760 --> 03:25:07.760
A

03:25:10.800 --> 03:25:15.600
Foul smell invaded your nostrils and caused your throat to see

03:25:17.600 --> 03:25:19.600
A hulking man said back

03:25:24.160 --> 03:25:26.320
I get maybe maybe duff as a colloquial term

03:25:26.960 --> 03:25:32.880
It for my area because when you say like you want the smoke like you want to fight and duff means like you'll beat someone up

03:25:32.880 --> 03:25:35.200
Like I'm gonna duff you. I don't know why that comes from

03:25:36.640 --> 03:25:38.640
I don't know

03:25:39.520 --> 03:25:42.560
I'm getting whiplash from excitement to laughing my ass off

03:25:44.960 --> 03:25:49.680
A hulking man sat by a brackish pond with his feet submerged in the dark water

03:25:51.680 --> 03:25:56.480
He pulled a hook from a pile of rotting fish and rose to his feet

03:26:00.560 --> 03:26:03.040
I'm the angler go fish

03:26:05.680 --> 03:26:07.840

Things but you can't do it for this one for some reason

03:32:39.040 --> 03:32:41.280

Oh, I don't fucking want to talk about my fucking session crowd control. Just let me end it. Jesus

03:34:17.920 --> 03:34:19.920
Oh, it's the app time

03:34:31.600 --> 03:34:33.600
God

Let's let's hang out

03:34:39.600 --> 03:34:42.800
Do it leshy the company app with you guys. Oh, yeah

03:34:43.520 --> 03:34:50.720
Yeah, my leshy voice is too powerful. If I had a model that matched the leshy voice, it would be over for everybody

03:34:51.600 --> 03:34:55.920
And um, you want BGM? Yeah, that's a good idea. Um

03:35:01.040 --> 03:35:03.040
And it would be the true Cunny Corpo

03:35:07.040 --> 03:35:09.040
I don't know if all of us were just

03:35:13.680 --> 03:35:17.520
It's still lightning and thundering outside. It's quite nice

03:35:26.640 --> 03:35:30.480
She just wanted you to just add extreme have inscription in the background

03:35:32.000 --> 03:35:36.080
Yeah, I I didn't rage quit. It was the game's just not

03:35:37.040 --> 03:35:40.720
Capturing and I don't know why I don't want to capture my display

03:35:41.680 --> 03:35:43.680
So, you know

03:35:43.680 --> 03:35:47.200
Model swap for April Fool's will be too powerful. What are you talking about?

03:35:48.080 --> 03:35:49.840
um

03:35:49.840 --> 03:35:53.120
Oh, you think we should swap models for April Fool's that'd be actually be funny

03:35:54.080 --> 03:35:55.600
um

03:35:55.600 --> 03:35:59.040
I think cats are running around. Um

03:36:01.120 --> 03:36:03.120
Trying to think of who I would swap with

03:36:06.240 --> 03:36:08.960
If I if me and Azura

03:36:09.200 --> 03:36:10.320
What

03:36:10.320 --> 03:36:14.320
We're to swap with the smaller body type girls in our gen

03:36:14.880 --> 03:36:19.600
Who do you think would play who I feel like Azura would be icy and I would be in uh, emmy

03:36:23.120 --> 03:36:25.920
Swap of scrawny you think I would swap with icy

03:36:30.400 --> 03:36:32.880
Actually, you know what I think I would like to see

03:36:33.120 --> 03:36:39.120
Mercy swap with emmy. I think that would be so funny

03:36:41.680 --> 03:36:47.120
Um, and then icy swapping with me would be hilarious

03:36:48.960 --> 03:36:50.960
And then

03:36:51.120 --> 03:36:53.120
Emmy being a

03:36:57.360 --> 03:36:59.920
And then straw knee could um

03:37:00.800 --> 03:37:02.800
Take uh

03:37:04.400 --> 03:37:06.160
Take mercies

03:37:06.160 --> 03:37:10.000

03:37:11.440 --> 03:37:15.280
The dolly doll me lolly fits in me. She's she's a switch

03:37:17.680 --> 03:37:19.360
Um

I think I think it would just be funny if anybody got swapped with anyone right now. What are you doing?

03:37:26.000 --> 03:37:30.720
Hi, are you trying to hide from boomy? Please don't step on my fucking keyboard

03:37:38.480 --> 03:37:42.720
Okay, all right. Oh, you're stepping on my fucking nipple. Thanks

03:37:45.840 --> 03:37:49.680
They're all funny as it is. I know I'm saying it would be like funnier as like a joke

03:37:50.400 --> 03:37:51.520
not like

03:37:51.520 --> 03:37:53.520
for a long term thing

03:37:53.840 --> 03:38:01.200
Scottish yandere I would actually that's a good point straw knee playing a yandere character would be very interesting

03:38:08.640 --> 03:38:11.120
But whoever takes straw knee needs to do the accent

03:38:12.800 --> 03:38:19.280
I think I'm the only one who could do the accent. I'm sorry. You can't see my mouth move because my cat is in front of me

03:38:20.880 --> 03:38:22.880
All right, there we go. She moved she swapped shoulders

03:38:23.520 --> 03:38:29.920
Um, reina, can you please sit down? Oh, she's rubbing against the microphone. Um, ma'am

03:38:31.360 --> 03:38:33.200
Ma'am

03:38:33.200 --> 03:38:36.960
Ma'am, please. This is the wendy ma'am. Don't headbutt the mic ma'am

03:38:40.000 --> 03:38:42.640
Reina so snuggly as per usual

03:38:43.680 --> 03:38:44.640
Um

03:38:44.640 --> 03:38:51.120
The cat actually engages with you. Yeah, reina is my fucking I call her my soul cat because she is my she's my baby

03:38:51.200 --> 03:38:53.200
I've had her since I was little

03:38:54.480 --> 03:38:56.000
Wow

03:38:56.000 --> 03:39:00.320
I mean reina is 14. She's an old lady and I love her

03:39:01.920 --> 03:39:03.920
She is my my big mama

03:39:05.520 --> 03:39:10.480
And um, it'll be funnier for someone to do her accent badly. That's a good point. That would be funnier

03:39:11.040 --> 03:39:12.880
uh

03:39:12.880 --> 03:39:17.840
I like I think I would only be the one be able to do the bad accent or like an okay accent

03:39:17.840 --> 03:39:22.320
I don't know if the other girls can even like attempt a scottish accent or do any accents

03:39:23.120 --> 03:39:26.800
Um, I think maybe emmy could because she has a good voice range

03:39:28.560 --> 03:39:33.920
Uh, yeah, my cat's interactive me. Uh, I think the only one who's not super snuggly is boomy

03:39:34.560 --> 03:39:36.800
We're just but he was like so snuggly as a kitten

03:39:37.440 --> 03:39:41.520
And then uh, he's in his like teenage phase where he doesn't eat his mom aka me

03:39:41.680 --> 03:39:45.120
So he only he's only really snuggly in the mornings and at night

03:39:45.360 --> 03:39:49.600
I don't understand why and when I get out of the shower. He just like wants to be picked up

03:39:50.080 --> 03:39:54.000
I don't I think he thinks because I like he thinks I'm dying in the shower and he's like mother

03:39:55.120 --> 03:39:57.120
Please hold me

03:39:57.600 --> 03:40:01.760
This little climb up on my shoulder. He's so cute. He's just he's a he's a menace

03:40:01.760 --> 03:40:06.640
But he's also pussy. It makes no sense. Like he's the biggest dick, but he's scared of everything

03:40:10.160 --> 03:40:14.400
Uh, yeah, I have three cats and pray for your furniture. They don't scratch my furniture. They're good

03:40:15.120 --> 03:40:19.200
I give them lots of toys to play with um and cat scratchers

03:40:20.000 --> 03:40:21.120
um

03:40:21.120 --> 03:40:23.120
And yeah, a lot of scratchers

03:40:23.840 --> 03:40:25.840
And I I clipped their claws. So they're fine

03:40:26.400 --> 03:40:29.520
I I I trimmed their claws. Actually, I need to trim their claws again

03:40:32.640 --> 03:40:35.040
Because I I trimmed them like a week ago and

03:40:36.560 --> 03:40:39.120
Um, put me almost fucking clawed my leg this morning

03:40:41.680 --> 03:40:45.520
You doing the Zeraz model it'll be funny since you have to be actually nice for once

03:40:50.560 --> 03:40:53.840
You know, I will say people think I don't do like any k-fabe

03:40:54.800 --> 03:40:56.480
Um, but I do

03:40:56.480 --> 03:41:00.800
I'm very I'm usually a very very nice person. I'm not I don't bully my chat

03:41:01.680 --> 03:41:03.120
Um

03:41:03.120 --> 03:41:05.520
If you knew me as Rina, I was usually the one bullied

03:41:07.600 --> 03:41:08.880
Um

03:41:08.880 --> 03:41:13.680
But I realize I do enjoy bullying my chat and bullying you guys and being mean

03:41:14.640 --> 03:41:16.640
Hey

03:41:18.320 --> 03:41:20.320
Um

03:41:21.120 --> 03:41:23.120
It's bully right. Yeah, I am kind

03:41:23.760 --> 03:41:26.320
Listen to my last audio. I'm the most kind person

03:41:27.200 --> 03:41:29.760
Letting you even come near me, you know

03:41:31.760 --> 03:41:33.760
Yeah, I like I like it

03:41:35.040 --> 03:41:36.240
Being

03:41:36.240 --> 03:41:38.240
Emmy bullies more

03:41:39.200 --> 03:41:41.200
Okay

03:41:41.600 --> 03:41:43.600
What is that supposed to mean?

03:41:48.320 --> 03:41:50.320
I I have noticed that people like

03:41:52.720 --> 03:42:00.480
Compare the girls to each other for some reason in terms of like what their kinks are because like we all

03:42:01.600 --> 03:42:03.600
um

03:42:04.400 --> 03:42:09.760
Like yeah, we all have like our tags that we we we do that like influence our

03:42:10.560 --> 03:42:12.560
Our audios

03:42:12.640 --> 03:42:16.880
But like doesn't mean we can't dip into other tags like me right now

03:42:17.520 --> 03:42:19.840
Pretending to be you know, cute and funny

03:42:20.720 --> 03:42:24.080
And then like amy being yandere because that's what she used to do

03:42:24.880 --> 03:42:26.880
or straw knee being like

03:42:26.960 --> 03:42:28.960
subbie or whatever the fuck

03:42:29.440 --> 03:42:31.440
um, but yeah

03:42:32.400 --> 03:42:37.200
It's just we're gonna have we're just we're just gonna have fun and do whatever, you know do whatever

03:42:37.920 --> 03:42:39.920
Don't don't pigeonhole us in a box

03:42:41.120 --> 03:42:45.600
Uh in the hole pigeonhole, whatever the fuck that means. I don't know. I'm tired

03:42:46.640 --> 03:42:48.640
Variety is good for the soul indeed

03:42:50.560 --> 03:42:53.440
Straw knee is still so you know, yeah, that's actually true that she is

03:42:54.400 --> 03:42:56.160
but like

03:42:56.160 --> 03:42:58.720
I have to be honest. I'm kind of frustrated

03:43:00.480 --> 03:43:02.480
because um

03:43:03.840 --> 03:43:05.520
I like

03:43:05.520 --> 03:43:07.120
I feel like

03:43:07.440 --> 03:43:09.440
A lot of the girls like some like

03:43:10.320 --> 03:43:12.800
some of the girls get to be themselves and

03:43:13.920 --> 03:43:18.160
Their fan bases are cool with that like straw knees because I my dream is like to make

03:43:19.040 --> 03:43:20.480
to cultivate

03:43:20.480 --> 03:43:23.760
A group like straw knees and like really you know dedicated

03:43:24.400 --> 03:43:29.680
Reflings and I love like that their relationship and they're like cool with how she is no matter what

03:43:30.960 --> 03:43:32.960
but like

03:43:33.280 --> 03:43:38.560
Then like when I try to branch out and do something else or one of the other girls do everybody's just like

03:43:41.040 --> 03:43:46.640
And I'm like come on man does let me have fun and I'm gonna do it anyways. You can't tell me what the fuck to do

03:43:50.720 --> 03:43:56.160
I think it adds a lot more depth to each of you almost like a real person because we are real people. What do you mean almost?

03:43:57.360 --> 03:43:59.360
We are real people

03:44:03.040 --> 03:44:05.040
Oh

03:44:05.280 --> 03:44:07.280
I'm new here. I don't really know

03:44:09.120 --> 03:44:11.120
You know, like that's how we are

03:44:13.360 --> 03:44:15.680
What do you mean? I don't like I like I like how my harem is

03:44:16.640 --> 03:44:18.080
well

03:44:18.080 --> 03:44:22.720
I think you guys are very similar to reeflings. I know some of you are reeflings. So like

03:44:23.760 --> 03:44:25.760
Yeah

03:44:27.280 --> 03:44:29.280
YouTubers or robots confirmed

03:44:30.480 --> 03:44:32.480
I think they meant the characters you play

03:44:32.960 --> 03:44:34.160
Uh

03:44:34.160 --> 03:44:36.160
And I said this earlier

03:44:36.240 --> 03:44:38.240
We're not playing characters

03:44:38.480 --> 03:44:40.240
straw knee hired us

03:44:40.240 --> 03:44:41.680
to be

03:44:41.680 --> 03:44:42.880
us

03:44:42.880 --> 03:44:47.840
And I think viewers took too much stock into the lore and the characters, which is not

03:44:48.960 --> 03:44:53.760
It's a thing in v2 being but it's not a huge part of it. It's just almost like a guideline

03:44:54.400 --> 03:44:56.000
for direction

03:44:56.000 --> 03:44:58.320
She hired us for our voices and to be ourselves

03:44:59.280 --> 03:45:01.600
Feelers AI generated. Yes

03:45:04.720 --> 03:45:06.720
But like you don't have to give me reassurance

03:45:07.680 --> 03:45:09.680
I appreciate it

03:45:09.760 --> 03:45:14.880
Um, I don't want this to seem like a hug boxy thing. Like I say something you guys are like, oh, but you're amazing

03:45:14.880 --> 03:45:16.560
Oh, but you're this

03:45:16.560 --> 03:45:21.040
Uh, I'm just telling you like I'm just telling you how I feel. That's it. But I still appreciate nonetheless

03:45:21.840 --> 03:45:23.680
um

03:45:23.680 --> 03:45:25.680
Yeah, reeflings are nice fellas. They're cool guys

03:45:26.000 --> 03:45:31.760
Exactly kayfabe is nice, but not if it diminishes the overall experience. Exactly. Ow. I'm just like

03:45:32.240 --> 03:45:34.240
hoping myself in the face

03:45:36.400 --> 03:45:38.400
It's okay to be you she be

03:45:38.800 --> 03:45:41.280
The lore was the catch but you guys keep us. Exactly

03:45:42.240 --> 03:45:44.240
Exactly

03:45:44.400 --> 03:45:50.720
It's a habit vtuber fans won't you but usually they don't like and all the small vtuber communities. I've been in which is a lot

03:45:52.080 --> 03:45:53.680
usually people just

03:45:53.680 --> 03:45:59.840
Complain about kayfabe and like why do we even have this nobody cares about lore get rid of the lore

03:46:00.320 --> 03:46:03.760
Nobody cares about this animated lore video people worked on uh

03:46:04.400 --> 03:46:10.960
And then like I just noticed for our company. It's not like people just really want us to stick to our lore and I'm like

03:46:12.320 --> 03:46:14.320
We don't have to

03:46:16.800 --> 03:46:21.840
You like me for me and if you don't like me for me, you know, you're entitled to that opinion

03:46:22.320 --> 03:46:27.280
You entitled that to to that opinion, uh, baby cakes. You're good. I respect you

03:46:29.280 --> 03:46:31.280
You know

03:46:33.680 --> 03:46:36.960
Lore's like the costume you wear at a party yourself. That's a good analogy

03:46:40.960 --> 03:46:42.560
Yeah, like

03:46:42.560 --> 03:46:48.480
Astrony was telling us the other day like she's like all I wanted you guys to do was to like say a funny

03:46:49.120 --> 03:46:54.640
Funny line pertaining to your kayfabe every now and then you guys don't have to like actually play someone and I'm like

03:46:57.120 --> 03:47:02.960
Okay, and then that's when I was like, okay, I'm not gonna like lean into the kayfabe of like

03:47:05.120 --> 03:47:08.160
Being the super huge

03:47:09.760 --> 03:47:11.440
jealous

03:47:11.440 --> 03:47:15.280
Demanding madam because I'm like I'm pretty okay. I'm okay. I'm fine

03:47:16.000 --> 03:47:20.160
Like I'm still growing and learning. I'm still like playing parts of the kayfabe

03:47:20.160 --> 03:47:23.200
But I'm just gonna do what I want because I'm just having fun

03:47:23.280 --> 03:47:27.520
And I I came here to be a content creator and make cool asmr content

03:47:28.080 --> 03:47:31.040
Um naughty and otherwise and yeah, I didn't and I know

03:47:32.080 --> 03:47:34.720
I'm tired now. Actually. I'm just got really easy

03:47:35.920 --> 03:47:38.560
Excuse me. Congrats on 6k. Thank you

03:47:40.880 --> 03:47:42.880
Um

03:47:43.840 --> 03:47:48.640
But anyways, I don't want to like perpetuate that conversation. I think I got it

03:47:49.600 --> 03:47:52.880
I think you guys get it. What I'm trying to say. Um

03:47:54.400 --> 03:47:56.400
But yeah

03:47:57.520 --> 03:47:59.200
Uh

03:47:59.200 --> 03:48:01.200
Rainy epitime

03:48:01.680 --> 03:48:04.160
I'm thinking of like what

03:48:07.920 --> 03:48:12.240
I'm just about games to play but like I feel like watching a horror movie, but I don't know what horror movie to want

03:48:12.880 --> 03:48:20.160
Oh, we gotta watch along next week for our first membership stream. We're gonna watch the master of disguise. I'm very excited. Um

03:48:21.440 --> 03:48:23.440
I think I have a collab next week

03:48:24.080 --> 03:48:29.200
Yeah, we do with another agency, which is gonna be cool. Um

03:48:30.720 --> 03:48:34.880
I'm a bitch with horror really are they core movies? Um

03:48:37.680 --> 03:48:41.920
Why is someone's name just diddy your name is fucking quantum physics official

03:48:42.880 --> 03:48:46.800
What the fuck is your name dude? Don't hate on don't hate on diddy. You have no right

03:48:50.480 --> 03:48:55.280
It's a good bad movie what freaking nda's a stream. No

03:48:57.840 --> 03:48:59.840
What movie

03:49:03.920 --> 03:49:06.960
I like paranormal hammer, but I like paranormal horror

03:49:06.960 --> 03:49:11.040
I can't watch paranormal horror though like too often or I'll like I

03:49:11.600 --> 03:49:14.560
Will start to get really paranoid and think that there's a monster in my house

03:49:18.560 --> 03:49:21.440
I can't believe she is a diddy supporter not like that

03:49:23.200 --> 03:49:25.200
Not like that

03:49:26.880 --> 03:49:28.880
Um

03:49:28.880 --> 03:49:33.840
Listen, I have the most creative name here. Isn't that just like your normal name? I'm sorry dude

03:49:35.280 --> 03:49:38.080
You also sound like you have a really bad porn star name

03:49:38.880 --> 03:49:42.880
I always like to know like what is the reason behind people's names

03:49:43.680 --> 03:49:49.200
Like why did you come up with that? Explain to me right now why you came up with your name

03:49:51.120 --> 03:49:56.080
I'm sheebie. I didn't pick my name, but it comes from sheebie shabari

03:49:57.200 --> 03:50:01.120
What and then cotton bump because I'm a cotton tail rabbit girl

03:50:01.680 --> 03:50:04.720
But I couldn't be cotton tail because there's already a cotton tail

03:50:05.600 --> 03:50:07.600
And that would be stupid

03:50:08.720 --> 03:50:10.720
I

03:50:11.120 --> 03:50:16.560
Don't think I got my monster fucker license. I I've said this before I actually have I said this before

03:50:16.960 --> 03:50:19.840
Um, when I'm scared of something I usually sexualize it

03:50:21.200 --> 03:50:26.800
So if it's like the babadook, I'm like, oh look give me the babadook pussy, you know

03:50:29.360 --> 03:50:31.360
I thought I should just change it from something other

03:50:32.000 --> 03:50:35.040
On other name by name, but you picked like the most boring one

03:50:35.600 --> 03:50:38.640
Some of you guys like tiger festivals nugget

03:50:40.320 --> 03:50:43.280
Blue sky like what are these names guys?

03:50:46.960 --> 03:50:53.040
Well yours desu, that's that's funny. That's a funny joke. I like that. That's a good one

03:50:54.000 --> 03:50:56.000
Babadick

04:00:29.280 --> 04:00:32.320
But it didn't make sense for mercy to be called karambita

04:00:33.520 --> 04:00:35.520

04:05:25.200 --> 04:05:28.400
No, I'm um portuguese from portugal

04:05:29.840 --> 04:05:32.720
Azores um missable wad

04:05:33.600 --> 04:05:36.880
I'm a very mixed bag. I thought this was a mixed hag and I liked that

04:05:37.840 --> 04:05:41.840
Part native american. I'm actually not native american at all. I thought I was

04:05:42.720 --> 04:05:47.920
Because you know, there's always like someone in your family when you're american that claims that you're that you're native

04:05:48.640 --> 04:05:51.920
They're like, oh, yeah, like we're like one eighth Cherokee

04:05:52.080 --> 04:05:54.080
And so when I did my like 23 and me

04:05:54.720 --> 04:06:00.080
Ancestry test, I'm like, oh, I wonder if I'm native and there's like nothing there about being native and I'm like

04:06:00.480 --> 04:06:04.720
My grandma fucking lied to me. They also said that we were italian too. I'm not italian

04:06:05.360 --> 04:06:07.680
Although it's funny because my mom looks very italian

04:06:08.400 --> 04:06:10.400
Italian, I don't know. I'm saying it like that

04:06:10.960 --> 04:06:16.000
I am part native american indian. I mean, oh you are. Why would you call it native american indian then?

04:06:16.000 --> 04:06:18.000
Why don't you just say you're a native american?

04:06:18.480 --> 04:06:20.480
Or an indigenous person

04:06:20.960 --> 04:06:22.960
You don't fucking say indian

04:06:29.040 --> 04:06:34.400
I don't know if you remember the other portion of that meme as uh with norman osborne as a different color

04:06:34.400 --> 04:06:36.400
Um

04:06:41.280 --> 04:06:43.200
Uh

04:06:43.200 --> 04:06:45.200
Sheeby speaks that gabagoo

04:06:45.520 --> 04:06:47.520
100% french here from like two villages

04:06:48.240 --> 04:06:51.280
Shout out to the colonizer then sheeby. Thanks mom. Whoo

04:06:54.640 --> 04:07:00.880
My dad it's okay. My dad's my dad's country where the was the first country to become independent from slavery. Let's go. Whoo

04:07:01.920 --> 04:07:03.920
um

04:07:04.480 --> 04:07:05.760
but

04:07:05.760 --> 04:07:08.640
No, like i'm a very it's it's so funny because on the internet

04:07:08.880 --> 04:07:10.880
I feel like i've been so corrupted

04:07:11.040 --> 04:07:12.640
Because i'm very

04:07:12.640 --> 04:07:18.960
Like and I don't care if you fucking hate me for saying this. Um, I'm very lgbtq friendly. I'm very progressive

04:07:19.680 --> 04:07:21.680
I'm very much a liberal friend

04:07:24.080 --> 04:07:27.440
Uh, and I just I don't know why I'm like this online

04:07:29.360 --> 04:07:32.640
I'm just an absolute fucking prick online, but you know

04:07:33.440 --> 04:07:35.440
I like I like having a little bit flavor

04:07:37.120 --> 04:07:40.880
It's like everybody nobody say like I'm not and I'm like I'm generally like

04:07:42.080 --> 04:07:44.080
I don't really give a fuck about

04:07:44.960 --> 04:07:46.800
uh

04:07:46.800 --> 04:07:48.800
Like if somebody says

04:07:49.040 --> 04:07:51.040
something

04:07:51.040 --> 04:07:54.320
Offensive or ignorant to me. I will put them in their place for their ignorance

04:07:54.880 --> 04:07:59.200
But I know I know the context of what's a joke and what's not a joke exactly jokes

04:07:59.600 --> 04:08:01.600
And I I enjoy dark humor. Yes

04:08:02.160 --> 04:08:04.160
I don't take personal offense

04:08:04.480 --> 04:08:11.120
Like sometimes people do just like say things in poor taste like when I was when I was younger. Um

04:08:12.320 --> 04:08:15.680
So my hair is curly you can see my beautiful curly hair

04:08:16.240 --> 04:08:20.000
I lost tracking because it's dark. Hold on. Let me turn on the light. Um

04:08:23.360 --> 04:08:26.320
Okay, turn on the light I have beautiful curly hair

04:08:27.280 --> 04:08:29.280
Um, so I usually uh

04:08:30.720 --> 04:08:33.440
With my type of curls, I'll put it up in like a

04:08:34.720 --> 04:08:39.120
Like a like I'll put in a silk bonnet so that my curls stay nice when I sleep

04:08:40.400 --> 04:08:43.520
And um, did I imagine I could love my she be more? Um

04:08:44.320 --> 04:08:46.320
And so my friend who's white

04:08:46.960 --> 04:08:48.960
Was just like making fun of me

04:08:49.040 --> 04:08:51.920
And I'm just sitting there with my with my bonnet on

04:08:52.480 --> 04:08:55.680
Um letting my hair dry after showering at her house because we're sleeping over

04:08:56.320 --> 04:08:58.320
She's like making fun of me and

04:08:58.800 --> 04:09:00.960
I'm like what why why you making fun of my bonnet?

04:09:00.960 --> 04:09:05.520
She's like because you look like you should belong on my family's plantation picking my cotton

04:09:05.520 --> 04:09:07.520
And I just kind of just stayed at her and I'm like

04:09:09.280 --> 04:09:11.280
Like I'm like I could make

04:09:12.480 --> 04:09:14.480
A way funnier joke than that

04:09:14.960 --> 04:09:16.560
That was just bad

04:09:16.560 --> 04:09:18.480
I'm like that was just dumb

04:09:18.480 --> 04:09:24.880
Like that's when your white friend gets too fucking comfortable with you and just thinks they could say anything and she apologized afterwards

04:09:25.600 --> 04:09:27.600
And I'm just like

04:09:27.840 --> 04:09:31.360
Brother it's to me. It's only funny when it's self deprecating humor

04:09:33.200 --> 04:09:34.800
Like um

04:09:34.800 --> 04:09:36.800
No shot someone is that oh

04:09:37.120 --> 04:09:39.120
Are you kidding me bro?

04:09:40.160 --> 04:09:42.160
Oh, please

04:09:42.880 --> 04:09:45.840
Oh, please there's uh when you're um

04:09:47.280 --> 04:09:49.280
When you're a mixed kid, uh

04:09:49.520 --> 04:09:52.400
Again, you're too white for the black kids. You're too black for the white kids

04:09:52.480 --> 04:09:53.600
And so

04:09:53.600 --> 04:09:59.280
When you're too black for the white kids, they'll make they'll think it's okay to make jokes like that

04:09:59.280 --> 04:10:03.600
And I just I don't really give a shit because it's one. I just just don't give a reaction

04:10:03.600 --> 04:10:09.360
And I don't care. Um, and then when it's black kids making fun of you for being like too white

04:10:09.760 --> 04:10:11.920
Um, they'll do the same thing and so

04:10:12.880 --> 04:10:14.880
They'll just say like, uh

04:10:14.880 --> 04:10:18.800
What did that fucking say? I think they like I remember these black kids said something about my mom

04:10:19.760 --> 04:10:21.760
Being like a snow bunny

04:10:23.360 --> 04:10:25.360
And I just looked at them like

04:10:26.400 --> 04:10:29.760
I cool anyways moving on

04:10:33.120 --> 04:10:34.480
Um

04:10:34.480 --> 04:10:36.080
And then like it's funny

04:10:36.080 --> 04:10:41.600
It's only funny to me when like you make fun of yourself or you make fun of your own race

04:10:43.040 --> 04:10:45.360
And that's why like I'll watch comedians who do that

04:10:46.480 --> 04:10:47.520
um

04:10:47.520 --> 04:10:51.040
Then it's funny to me, but like when it's someone who's just like, haha

04:10:51.760 --> 04:10:54.640
Your gamer word and I'm just like, okay

04:10:55.680 --> 04:11:00.320
Was that was supposed to be like come on. You could have said that in a better way like, you know

04:11:01.840 --> 04:11:04.880
Your racism from all sides and no, it's not racism. It's just ignorance

04:11:05.680 --> 04:11:06.880
like there's

04:11:06.880 --> 04:11:13.520
I haven't experienced like real racism in like a very long time. I'll be honest with you. Um

04:11:14.480 --> 04:11:18.960
It's usually people just like trolling and like just wanting to get a rise out of me

04:11:18.960 --> 04:11:23.680
Which I don't really think they're necessarily racist. They're just like just kind of be a stupid, you know

04:11:24.160 --> 04:11:25.120
um

04:11:25.120 --> 04:11:29.200
Yeah, the last time I had someone like be legit racist was when the story I told before

04:11:29.600 --> 04:11:33.520
Or someone called me the gamer word when I wouldn't give them their

04:11:34.320 --> 04:11:38.880
Their pickup order because it was or it was canceled for some reason. Um

04:11:39.760 --> 04:11:43.840
And then before that I had this European woman

04:11:44.960 --> 04:11:46.160
um

04:11:46.160 --> 04:11:50.880
Definitely talked to me like, you know how sometimes like older

04:11:51.920 --> 04:11:53.120
folks

04:11:53.120 --> 04:11:55.120
speak to like

04:11:55.280 --> 04:11:58.640
Darker skinned folks a certain way. They'll be like, hey boy get over here

04:12:00.000 --> 04:12:02.560
So she spoke to me like that. I was like, I don't

04:12:03.520 --> 04:12:09.040
Okay, she called me she called me girl. She's like girl and she had like a very thick accent

04:12:09.760 --> 04:12:11.760
um condescending

04:12:12.080 --> 04:12:14.880
Kind of like talk slow like I didn't know how to speak English

04:12:15.760 --> 04:12:18.560
And I'm like, I'm from fucking america. I was born here

04:12:19.680 --> 04:12:26.000
I was literally fucking born here. You don't have to talk to me like that, dude. I can understand. I can't speak any other language, dude

04:12:27.120 --> 04:12:29.120
um

04:12:29.280 --> 04:12:33.360
Girl come here. Grab me mine. Give me your finest ways

04:12:36.000 --> 04:12:42.480
Um, but again, I don't take it personally because people are just gonna be fucking ignorant and you know, they'll just die off someday

04:12:42.480 --> 04:12:44.000
So I don't really give a shit

04:12:44.000 --> 04:12:44.800
um

04:12:44.800 --> 04:12:49.840
It's just I just think of it in like in hindsight and I just like laugh like when I was super young I was like

04:12:50.720 --> 04:12:57.360
Really sensitive like super fucking sensitive and then I started playing csgo and I grew out of that real quick

04:12:59.120 --> 04:13:01.120
um

04:13:01.120 --> 04:13:06.720
My once got asked if I had a green card and trigger me to kick him out of the store. That's fucked. That's fucked

04:13:07.520 --> 04:13:10.400
Pulling over butter. Yeah, I'm like I'm like token

04:13:12.240 --> 04:13:17.440
Just kidding though. Uh, yeah the boomers will die off. So, you know, they'll die. We'll be fine

04:13:18.000 --> 04:13:21.600
Although I'm getting up an age being 56. It's it's kind of scary

04:13:21.600 --> 04:13:30.960
Sorry, drink some water. How you doing right now? Your eye is watering

04:13:32.080 --> 04:13:34.080
I don't have a knack at near me or a wipe your little eye

04:13:42.160 --> 04:13:44.160
Oh my god

04:13:45.280 --> 04:13:47.280
We're already way better than like 30 years ago. Yeah

04:13:48.240 --> 04:13:52.560
I'm gonna hit 60s in that ropes break off. Yeah

04:13:53.840 --> 04:13:56.400
Means like the finest wine we're getting cougars

04:13:57.920 --> 04:14:04.480
Yeah, I'm 56 you guys if you guys don't know I'm 56. I am the oldest vtuber in the vtubing community

04:14:06.080 --> 04:14:08.080
Uh for real

04:14:08.080 --> 04:14:12.800
56, although I think mom key d follows close behind because she's 40. So, you know

04:14:13.200 --> 04:14:18.320
I am 56. I'm just in really good shape. Uh, I work on my figure

04:14:24.560 --> 04:14:26.720
Some grand tubers who are the other grand tubers?

04:14:28.320 --> 04:14:30.320
You know black don't crack

04:14:30.800 --> 04:14:33.920
And also the black of the berry the sweet of the juice just look at Azura

04:14:36.640 --> 04:14:38.640
I can't wait for my fucking brown toggle bro

04:14:39.360 --> 04:14:41.600
Saying this is a white vtuber is hilarious

04:14:42.080 --> 04:14:47.280
Because no, it's actually really funny because if my shit that I say gets clipped out of context and like put somewhere

04:14:47.600 --> 04:14:49.600
It'll be so funny because then

04:14:50.160 --> 04:14:55.760
I could bait the community so fucking hard and be like and just say like the most out of pocket shit

04:14:57.200 --> 04:15:03.360
And then somebody who put me on blasts and be like, I can't believe people in this community are talking like this

04:15:03.680 --> 04:15:07.840
Like look at this agency vtuber. He's using these words and then I'm like

04:15:12.160 --> 04:15:18.640
Um, imagine the clout pass mode activate you you've activated my race card

04:15:18.640 --> 04:15:20.640
Oh

04:15:30.960 --> 04:15:33.520
God I am fucking funny as hell

04:15:38.160 --> 04:15:39.760
Uh

04:15:39.760 --> 04:15:42.720
Although it's funny. I like I definitely need to go outside

04:15:43.280 --> 04:15:48.240
Because I'm about to revoke my own card with how light skin I am right now. I'm so pale

04:15:48.960 --> 04:15:50.960
It's bad. Um

04:15:51.600 --> 04:15:55.600
If I was thinking after the storms pass, I think it's gonna be storming for a little bit

04:15:56.080 --> 04:16:01.040
But I'm gonna try to go to the beach. Um, I wanted my days off since I work from home

04:16:02.560 --> 04:16:07.760
I I somebody I asked twitter. Oh, what should I tell people I do for my job and somebody said a government agent

04:16:07.760 --> 04:16:12.160
So I think I might stick with that. She's funny in a racist. No, I'm not racist

04:16:13.760 --> 04:16:16.080
I love all everybody from all walks of life

04:16:16.720 --> 04:16:23.040
Trust me, uh, one of my best friend's dad is a very fucking racist person

04:16:24.400 --> 04:16:26.400
Uh

04:16:26.480 --> 04:16:33.120
It's so I'm not like them at all. So I'm like, that's my when I know if I start talking like him. I know I fucked up

04:16:35.040 --> 04:16:40.400
I'm only pretend my 1949 moment. Oh, I told my parents about that scene

04:16:41.040 --> 04:16:47.840
In fucking class of 09 my dad was laughing his ass off and my mom looked mortified. It was so fucking funny. Um

04:16:49.680 --> 04:16:53.520
But it was it was yeah, I'm not racist. This is something gonna raise

04:16:57.200 --> 04:17:02.800
No, I'm just I'm just silly. I'm just I'm a goof. I'm just a dark humor girl. I'm just uh, yeah

04:17:03.920 --> 04:17:09.440
It's not racist. If you hit everyone equally. Yeah, I do. I prefer animals. That sounds weird. Um

04:17:10.720 --> 04:17:13.600
I prefer, uh, my company of my cats

04:17:14.400 --> 04:17:15.760
um

04:17:15.760 --> 04:17:20.880
Doing anything fancy for pride month. No, I remember the last time I like actually did something for pride month

04:17:20.960 --> 04:17:26.160
I did a really cool, uh, because I used to be a makeup youtuber as well not a makeup youtuber

04:17:26.240 --> 04:17:28.560
I tried to do makeup

04:17:29.200 --> 04:17:34.640
Videos on youtube and on instagram. I did a really cute like pan flag

04:17:35.200 --> 04:17:38.480
Um, eye shadow. It came really nice came really nice

04:17:39.280 --> 04:17:40.240
um

04:17:40.400 --> 04:17:42.400
Why are we calling her racist?

04:17:42.640 --> 04:17:48.400
Because they're silly. Well, me you're in the way. Oh, baby. Come here. Come here. Hi, baby

04:17:52.400 --> 04:17:54.400
Why do you smell like my lotion?

04:17:56.480 --> 04:18:01.520
You smell like you got into my fucking lotion. What are you? Are you good?

04:18:03.040 --> 04:18:05.280
He was like that was high expression on his face

04:18:06.240 --> 04:18:13.520
Influencer she be must have been a time. Yeah, you know, I wore many hats when I was

04:18:14.880 --> 04:18:21.280
Going into content creation as a southern backman. I can tell you I'm not racist, but has preceded some of those wild shit

04:18:22.080 --> 04:18:23.280
um

04:18:23.280 --> 04:18:25.600
That reminds me of like that fucking vine

04:18:26.160 --> 04:18:30.960
Of that one girl who's like, I'm not racist, but 80 people

04:18:31.920 --> 04:18:36.080
But she's fucking loses it why lotion this is a cat

04:18:36.960 --> 04:18:43.120
People there's lube and lotion lotion like my body lotion. He probably knocked it over. It's probably fucking exploded all right

04:18:43.760 --> 04:18:45.760
My what should I call it? Um

04:18:47.120 --> 04:18:49.120
Uh bathroom

04:18:51.440 --> 04:18:56.560
He's someone's open hookups and then like he says something that I'm not racist. I will like any color hole

04:18:57.360 --> 04:19:02.320
I think my favorite thing people say is this like I have I'm not racist. I have a black friend

04:19:04.320 --> 04:19:06.960
I remember I remember somebody

04:19:08.080 --> 04:19:09.600
like one of

04:19:09.600 --> 04:19:11.520
My uh friends

04:19:11.520 --> 04:19:15.440
Like we were in a group. I think we're going to like the movies or something. I don't remember what the fuck we were seeing

04:19:15.840 --> 04:19:20.720
But one of them said that they're like I have a black friend and they pointed at me and I'm like, no man

04:19:20.800 --> 04:19:22.800
I don't count. I'm only half a black person

04:19:23.760 --> 04:19:26.320
Like you need you need to find another one to count as a full

04:19:30.480 --> 04:19:32.480
I'm like, no

04:19:36.000 --> 04:19:38.000
Need at least two. Mm-hmm

04:19:38.720 --> 04:19:40.720
You know two halves must make a hole

04:19:41.360 --> 04:19:43.360
and like it's funny because like

04:19:44.160 --> 04:19:46.160
I'm like the most americanized

04:19:48.080 --> 04:19:51.680
Like I'm not I didn't come from another country like my dad immigrated from Haiti

04:19:52.320 --> 04:19:54.320
um

04:19:54.560 --> 04:19:59.760
And but like not when he was older like when he was like five. So my dad is very americanized too

04:20:00.720 --> 04:20:02.400
and so

04:20:02.400 --> 04:20:04.560
people like think I'm like very

04:20:05.200 --> 04:20:06.320
like

04:20:06.320 --> 04:20:08.320
cultural this or that

04:20:08.320 --> 04:20:13.200
And like I can't like I've done my research because I you know, I owe it to myself to learn my culture

04:20:13.440 --> 04:20:15.520
But then like I have my white girl moments

04:20:18.000 --> 04:20:20.000
For sure for sure

04:20:20.960 --> 04:20:25.760
I honestly heard the term racism thrown around the media consumes so much it kind of losses. Yeah, and like I like

04:20:29.200 --> 04:20:34.080
I don't feel like like there's a lot of like races, but it's mostly like people that are fucking hateful

04:20:34.880 --> 04:20:38.720
And it doesn't it's like different. I don't know. I can't really explain it

04:20:40.160 --> 04:20:42.160
I got a half black friend

04:20:42.800 --> 04:20:48.560
Bro, I had a friend who's indian trade have asked me since I'm africa. Can I see the

04:20:51.120 --> 04:20:53.120
Bro

04:20:53.360 --> 04:20:59.360
My civilization he has to recognize you forgot how to speak curl. Yeah, my my my dad is my dad speaks curl, but like

04:21:00.800 --> 04:21:04.240
My grandmother says he has like an american accent when he speaks it

04:21:08.400 --> 04:21:10.400
Pass is not conferrable

04:21:12.960 --> 04:21:14.960
I

04:21:15.120 --> 04:21:19.680
Yeah, I honestly I'm telling you class of 09 educated me with the

04:21:20.400 --> 04:21:22.160
um

04:21:22.160 --> 04:21:26.160
Like white nationalism versus white supremacists and I was like, oh

04:21:27.920 --> 04:21:32.400
Okay, they both suck. What cool good to know the difference

04:21:34.560 --> 04:21:38.080
Um, but yeah, it was just this is interesting

04:21:39.040 --> 04:21:44.080
Why am I talking about this shit bro? Sometimes I'm like I

04:21:46.000 --> 04:21:48.000
I can't wait to get

04:21:48.240 --> 04:21:55.040
The lia fans because like then I can just be like no holds fucking bar because youtube is so

04:21:56.720 --> 04:22:00.960
I hate having to keep cut down my vods when I I'm just talking to you guys

04:22:01.360 --> 04:22:03.920
But I probably have to cut this vod down too

04:22:04.640 --> 04:22:07.120
Because I just I can't be say so

04:22:07.600 --> 04:22:12.640
But it's funny. I swear. I was more fucking say so when I was in india on twitch than I am now

04:22:12.720 --> 04:22:15.760
I don't even and I'm in an agency. What the fuck is wrong with me?

04:22:19.600 --> 04:22:21.600
Never the cause of it. I have much of an impact

04:22:24.720 --> 04:22:28.560
Never asked a woman her age never asked a man so I never asked she'd be to not edit a

04:22:29.760 --> 04:22:31.760
That's good

04:22:32.320 --> 04:22:34.480
When I get the upload notice I can't go

04:22:36.080 --> 04:22:39.040
I think I think you guys are a bad influence. It all started

04:22:40.160 --> 04:22:43.920
When I started going on the interwebs when I was first becoming a vtuber

04:22:45.840 --> 04:22:47.840
This is some not so savory sites

04:22:50.080 --> 04:22:56.800
Fuck you guys corrupt me different fans bring up topics maybe. Oh, yeah, actually. Yeah, that's a that's a pretty good point

04:22:57.520 --> 04:23:00.800
Uh, we have a different fan base. I have a different fan base than I did before

04:23:01.680 --> 04:23:03.680
Um, that's true

04:23:03.680 --> 04:23:05.520
like I know I

04:23:05.520 --> 04:23:08.400
I have seen like one or two of my past

04:23:09.200 --> 04:23:15.360
Like of rena's fans around but because of the constant I do now a lot of my fans don't watch me

04:23:15.440 --> 04:23:20.640
Which is totally fine. I accept it. It sucks, you know, it's sad, but you know, I totally get it. Um

04:23:22.000 --> 04:23:27.040
So I think yeah, it's it is a hundred percent a different fan base different questions different

04:23:27.680 --> 04:23:28.880
um

04:23:28.960 --> 04:23:30.960
Yeah

04:23:31.760 --> 04:23:35.600
Fans reflect the streamer that that makes me sound really bad

04:23:37.280 --> 04:23:40.480
Maybe we're just too submissive to stop holding from saying controversial stuff

04:23:40.880 --> 04:23:46.480
But like is it I'm thinking I'm like, do I really say controversial stuff? I don't

04:23:47.840 --> 04:23:53.520
Think like I feel like I don't know. I feel like I'm just real. I don't really think I'm controversial

04:23:55.600 --> 04:23:58.480
I find it weird that you're so open about your past life. Um

04:23:59.600 --> 04:24:01.600
Yeah, see not really. Um

04:24:02.960 --> 04:24:06.560
We're allowed to be open about our past life. It's fine. Um

04:24:07.360 --> 04:24:10.640
If I there's nothing against us to talk about it

04:24:11.200 --> 04:24:16.320
Strani said that when we debuted we can even just we can we can tell our fans that um

04:24:18.000 --> 04:24:21.840
Uh that we are in v alert all I did was post a meme on my

04:24:22.960 --> 04:24:25.520
My rena account when I was rena no way. Um

04:24:25.520 --> 04:24:26.640
Um

04:24:26.640 --> 04:24:30.560
But I didn't really feel the need to I had a small community

04:24:31.440 --> 04:24:33.440
I knew they would find me if they wanted to

04:24:34.000 --> 04:24:36.000
um, so yeah

04:24:36.080 --> 04:24:38.880
Don't have to pretend you didn't exist until the other yeah

04:24:39.600 --> 04:24:41.600
Not controversial but edgy

04:24:42.240 --> 04:24:44.000
I don't really think I'm edgy

04:24:44.000 --> 04:24:47.680
I don't even think I'm based look at fucking emmy emmy's way more base than I am you kidding me

04:24:48.480 --> 04:24:50.480
Oh my god, you exist before two weeks ago

04:24:51.120 --> 04:24:57.600
She entered one time. I think she changed grew up on it molded by the perversion there whole life. Yeah

04:24:58.240 --> 04:25:00.240
I never been I I literally

04:25:02.240 --> 04:25:04.240
Yes, like literally six months ago

04:25:06.000 --> 04:25:12.160
Actually, no not six months. It'll be a year because I was uh, I was a refling. I was an og refling. So that's a lie. Um

04:25:14.080 --> 04:25:17.840
Been on the grind for 56 years things getting too sensitive

04:25:18.800 --> 04:25:22.720
So you didn't tell your old community I posted it so like you know the lore

04:25:23.520 --> 04:25:25.440
um picture

04:25:25.440 --> 04:25:27.440
of like me

04:25:27.440 --> 04:25:30.960
Holding queen's hand as she's dying in a hospital bed

04:25:32.000 --> 04:25:34.960
Somebody who had figured out who I was

04:25:35.680 --> 04:25:41.200
When we uh did our voice reveals edited rena as queen in the bed

04:25:42.160 --> 04:25:49.280
Dying of sickness and me as she be holding her hand and it sent me so I just posted that

04:25:50.400 --> 04:25:54.080
And like like she's like passing the torch, but like it made perfect sense

04:25:54.080 --> 04:25:56.320
It was like rena's passing the torch to she be

04:25:57.040 --> 04:25:58.560
You know, I thought it was great

04:25:58.560 --> 04:26:04.320
So I'm like so I just posted that and everybody responded with lmao and like they thought I was hilarious

04:26:04.400 --> 04:26:06.640
And I shout out to that person who made that fucking meme

04:26:11.200 --> 04:26:15.520
I'm dying. Stop be boxing caption. That would have been funny. Um

04:26:16.720 --> 04:26:23.120
And yeah, like we're we're allowed to talk about this stuff. I'm very thankful for the fan base I had back then

04:26:23.840 --> 04:26:25.360
um

04:26:25.360 --> 04:26:29.520
And they knew how much I wanted to be an agency and they believed in me more than than I did

04:26:30.320 --> 04:26:33.760
And I thank them for that because I would not be here if it weren't for them

04:26:33.840 --> 04:26:37.680
I would have no audience. I had no one to stream to and but they gave me a chance

04:26:38.640 --> 04:26:44.480
Um, but yeah, where can I see that meme? Uh, you can't see it because I I nuked

04:26:45.120 --> 04:26:46.320
uh

04:26:46.320 --> 04:26:51.280
All of my past life stuff. So like you may notice that I

04:26:52.480 --> 04:26:54.480
um

04:26:54.480 --> 04:26:57.200
Went on an indefinite hiatus as rena

04:26:57.840 --> 04:27:04.240
Uh, I'll be honest with you. She's essentially graduated. I just did a definite hiatus because

04:27:04.960 --> 04:27:05.920
um

04:27:06.000 --> 04:27:09.920
Rina means a lot to me as she represents rena who is my cat

04:27:10.480 --> 04:27:14.880
Um, so I and rena is a seimees cat. So I wanted to

04:27:15.520 --> 04:27:23.120
I made a character after her because rena is my baby. Um, so that when rena passes on which she is older

04:27:23.200 --> 04:27:29.360
She's 14. It will happen eventually. I'm mentally prepared for that. Um, that she lives on

04:27:30.560 --> 04:27:33.360
With rena. I actually might just change rena's name to rena

04:27:34.160 --> 04:27:38.880
To be honest with you, but I will not be going back to rena. Um

04:27:40.240 --> 04:27:44.320
I will be she be I am she be she be is me. I am her

04:27:45.440 --> 04:27:47.920
We are each other. Um, some people

04:27:48.640 --> 04:27:53.840
Uh, presumed because I made her an indefinite hiatus that like they thought I was gonna go back

04:27:54.320 --> 04:27:59.600
And somebody mentioned that um, I had commissioned a lot of stuff like for a whole new fucking

04:28:00.320 --> 04:28:05.280
Like asset package and debut thing and model and everything for rena

04:28:06.640 --> 04:28:08.800
But then I was hired to be a lure so I can't use it

04:28:08.800 --> 04:28:13.360
And so as people saw posts of like my assets being in showcases and they're like, wow

04:28:13.760 --> 04:28:18.960
She's just planning on going back bro. I commissioned those back in fucking february chill out

04:28:20.400 --> 04:28:22.400
I'm not gonna be rena

04:28:22.800 --> 04:28:26.240

I can be very sweet. I'm a very sweet and kind and caring person. I'm a fucking empathetic person

04:29:06.560 --> 04:29:08.720
Um, that's why I cry like a bitch half the time

04:29:10.240 --> 04:29:13.840
Because I just get so emotional because I feel so deeply and I love so deeply

04:29:14.560 --> 04:29:19.200
Um, vtuber's teaching ideas is like a crazy personality disorder. I'll be honest with you like

04:29:20.000 --> 04:29:25.440
That's what I love about being a vtuber is that you have so many possibilities

04:29:26.000 --> 04:29:32.880
Um, like I if I wanted to for my 2.0. I could just be like, I'm no longer a rabbit. I'm a slug girl

04:29:33.520 --> 04:29:38.400
I'm a slime girl. Um, I'm the slime girl. I wanted gen two

Uh, like when you have the money to do so the support the right artists the assets like you can be who you want

04:29:47.280 --> 04:29:54.640
And that's what I love about vtubing. I was so put in a box as a flash streamer. Um, when I was one and as a

04:29:55.520 --> 04:29:57.840

04:31:57.760 --> 04:31:59.760
That I did for fias medical bills

04:32:00.400 --> 04:32:06.640
Um when I was rina and I it's still I again I commissioned that in fucking march and it's not there

04:32:06.720 --> 04:32:08.720
So I feel really fucking bad about that

04:32:09.360 --> 04:32:11.360
Uh, I wondering if my

04:32:12.080 --> 04:32:14.640
The skeb artist goes to me for that which sucks

04:32:15.680 --> 04:32:18.560
I'm gonna buy nfts. No bad for the environment

04:32:19.120 --> 04:32:20.400
Um

04:32:20.400 --> 04:32:22.800
And they're also fucking waste of money. You can't do shit with them

04:32:23.680 --> 04:32:25.760
I'm just gonna copy paste your fucking nft

04:32:26.400 --> 04:32:28.400
invest in a she be coin

04:32:28.960 --> 04:32:31.120
Blind bunny. Yeah, slight money would actually be pretty cool

04:32:31.600 --> 04:32:36.720
No, because I'm a element now anatomy kind of as you took me back a little. Yeah, some people like as I've I've I've

04:32:37.200 --> 04:32:38.960
Did that with rina too

04:32:38.960 --> 04:32:42.480
They're limited to emotes is that a limit only and not your best in the art for it. Um

04:32:43.600 --> 04:32:47.360
I think there is like a limit for emotes like on youtube

04:32:47.920 --> 04:32:51.280
I again, I'm not I'm not far super familiar with youtube's

04:32:51.920 --> 04:32:53.520
YouTube's

04:32:53.520 --> 04:32:57.200
With youtube and their policy on how many emotes you can have I

04:32:58.160 --> 04:33:02.240
Like so I have like I already have more than the four that you're using

04:33:03.040 --> 04:33:04.800
um

04:33:04.800 --> 04:33:08.080
Like I I have a crying one. I have some other ones

04:33:08.880 --> 04:33:11.920
Uh, and then I got 10 more that

04:33:12.720 --> 04:33:14.240
I'm that um

04:33:14.240 --> 04:33:16.000
I commissioned

04:33:16.000 --> 04:33:18.160
and so

04:33:18.160 --> 04:33:20.560
I don't so I'm assuming I can have around like

04:33:21.280 --> 04:33:26.000
15 maybe 20. I don't know. Yeah, there's no 17. Yeah

04:33:27.600 --> 04:33:29.600
Um

04:33:29.680 --> 04:33:31.680
I want to say like 50 ish. Yeah. Oh, okay

04:33:32.480 --> 04:33:39.280
Well, where are they? I don't know like I commissioned. Well, oh the ones we I we just commissioned our emotes like more emotes

04:33:39.760 --> 04:33:44.080
Um, the other ones. I don't know why they're all not added there. Again. I don't know how youtube works

04:33:44.160 --> 04:33:48.640
I don't meant manager set up account. So I don't know. I don't know if I can know

04:33:49.360 --> 04:33:50.800
um

04:33:50.800 --> 04:33:52.960
You can put bttv on youtube. Oh, okay

04:33:54.400 --> 04:34:00.320
Are there any plans for management yourself? I'm making a discord server for you vealer as a whole now that you mentioned emotes and stuff

04:34:01.040 --> 04:34:03.280
You can't there's a notification server

04:34:03.840 --> 04:34:05.840
Um, just for our

04:34:05.840 --> 04:34:10.480
And everybody's safety. We're not gonna have a personal server that we frequent. Um,

04:34:11.040 --> 04:34:14.000
I know there's like fan servers and stuff and that's cool and all

04:34:14.400 --> 04:34:20.240
Which also the people who run the fan server if you're watching can you please change it to not look like our official

04:34:20.880 --> 04:34:26.320
Fucking twitter. I will get notifications if you like my stuff and I think it's our official twitter, but it's not

04:34:26.800 --> 04:34:29.920
Um, make it make your own fucking logo. Um

04:34:31.280 --> 04:34:33.520
Yeah, just because like we don't need groomer cords

04:34:33.600 --> 04:34:37.760
We don't need people getting like feeling like they're being favored or the fuck like Jesus

04:34:38.320 --> 04:34:41.520
I don't feel like dealing with that shit. It's so much. You don't need that

04:34:41.840 --> 04:34:44.480
Um, I know you guys want to hang out with us, but you can hang out with me right now

04:34:44.960 --> 04:34:46.960
I'm talking to you face to face

04:34:47.840 --> 04:34:51.360
Anime girl to titties to viewer, you know

04:34:52.880 --> 04:34:59.920
I think it's I think it's better this way for everyone. We don't we don't need that. Um, you know, trust me

04:35:00.000 --> 04:35:01.840
I would love to be

04:35:01.840 --> 04:35:07.200
In a discord with everybody, but and I know I would behave. It's just how some people act

04:35:07.840 --> 04:35:10.720
Uh in a discord when there is a

04:35:11.600 --> 04:35:13.600
talent in there, um

04:35:14.640 --> 04:35:16.640
Sometimes they uh

04:35:17.200 --> 04:35:19.920
Because they're in closer proximity to the the talent they

04:35:20.800 --> 04:35:22.800
They feel like they're owed something and could like

04:35:23.520 --> 04:35:27.920
Spam them harass them blah blah blah blah and like I don't feel like fucking dealing with that

04:35:28.000 --> 04:35:30.160
Management doesn't feel like fucking dealing with that. Um

04:35:31.360 --> 04:35:34.480
Vibes can really fucking weird. Yeah, like I've seen I've been in

04:35:35.040 --> 04:35:36.880
discords where those talents are there

04:35:37.520 --> 04:35:40.080
And it's kind of a fucking shit show. So

04:35:40.960 --> 04:35:42.960
I think it's better like

04:35:43.280 --> 04:35:45.280
Yeah

04:35:45.440 --> 04:35:47.440
Yeah

04:35:47.680 --> 04:35:52.320
She doesn't want to talk to us. She hates this. No, no, god, like I would talk to you all the time

04:35:52.640 --> 04:35:55.520
Like I literally fucking quit my job so I could be with you more

04:35:55.520 --> 04:35:57.520
Like

04:35:58.560 --> 04:36:04.320
Come on be for real. Um, I'm tempted to I'm thinking about making um

04:36:05.360 --> 04:36:09.520
I've seen other streamers do this where they add their, uh

04:36:11.360 --> 04:36:14.240
Actually, maybe that's not the best idea. I'd have to ask management about it

04:36:14.240 --> 04:36:20.480
But I've seen people add their schedule as a video and they'll like give updates in that pre chat from time to time

04:36:21.040 --> 04:36:24.880
Um, but yeah, because you know, there's there's a there's a line you can't

04:36:25.120 --> 04:36:28.880
Like you have to be careful and like have a line you can't cross

04:36:29.440 --> 04:36:32.560
Just so people don't get hurt. Like I don't want people to be hurt

04:36:33.200 --> 04:36:38.160
Um, like I know I see you was very upset. Um, because somebody hurt her feelings

04:36:38.240 --> 04:36:41.760
And I don't want anybody else to feel that way viewer or talent. So

04:36:42.720 --> 04:36:46.240
It's sometimes we got to do stuff that protects our mental health

04:36:46.960 --> 04:36:51.280
Um, but yeah, like, you know, you see me pop into like preach out a couple times

04:36:52.160 --> 04:36:57.520
Um, but yeah, I was thinking about a free chat. I'd have to ask management though. Um, but yeah

04:37:00.000 --> 04:37:02.000
The other girls are free to

04:37:02.000 --> 04:37:07.440
Reach out like that. Yeah, does she do it like in the video of that day or does she have like an actual thing?

04:37:09.920 --> 04:37:13.040
Someone made the girls cry and pop in the trunk

04:37:14.160 --> 04:37:16.160
No, yes. No someone. Yeah

04:37:16.720 --> 04:37:18.720
I

04:37:19.360 --> 04:37:25.440
Keep yeah, well like I'll I'll keep you close like again, like you guys said chart reflect streamer. Um

04:37:26.480 --> 04:37:30.720
I know my boundaries. I would tell you guys if you ever I ever thought you guys crossed them

04:37:31.440 --> 04:37:32.720
Um

04:37:32.720 --> 04:37:37.040
But you guys are very well behaved. I don't feel any sort of way for that

04:37:37.600 --> 04:37:40.000
Oh, I mean as a schedule free chat. Oh, okay

04:37:42.000 --> 04:37:43.840
Wait, huh

04:37:43.840 --> 04:37:45.440
Why didn't

04:37:45.440 --> 04:37:47.440
Was I supposed to do that?

04:37:48.560 --> 04:37:50.560
Why am I so fucking dumb?

04:37:53.520 --> 04:37:55.520
Oh gurra's streaming

04:37:56.720 --> 04:38:00.960
Her 3d bird I'm oh guys I'm overlapping gurra. I might have to end stream

04:38:02.720 --> 04:38:04.720
Jesus fuck

04:38:07.680 --> 04:38:08.720
Wait

04:38:08.720 --> 04:38:12.240
Why the oh, I'm like, why did Amy just mention me as I'm talking to her?

04:38:12.240 --> 04:38:14.960
She just tagged me because she she blew up on the tweeters

04:38:17.840 --> 04:38:20.080
Damn, what the fuck she did blow up on the tweeters

04:38:20.960 --> 04:38:24.080
Hey, she caught up to me. Yay. Let's fucking go

04:38:25.920 --> 04:38:27.920
I was hoping the girls would fucking catch up to me in the

04:38:29.040 --> 04:38:32.480
So awkward having so many people in my fucking old. Um

04:38:33.920 --> 04:38:35.920
She'll probably pass me soon enough

04:38:36.720 --> 04:38:38.720
Where is it? Where is her?

04:38:39.360 --> 04:38:40.560
I can't

04:38:40.560 --> 04:38:43.520
Because then I want to see how she set it up so I can replicate it

04:38:52.640 --> 04:38:56.320
Just creeping on your account. Amy just creeping on your account

04:38:57.520 --> 04:39:00.160
Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. Amy

04:39:01.200 --> 04:39:04.800
It's okay. Just accept it. Amy. Where the fuck is it?

04:39:05.840 --> 04:39:09.840
Where is it? Where is it? I don't see that

04:39:11.360 --> 04:39:13.360
I don't see the free chat. Oh, I found it

04:39:16.000 --> 04:39:21.680
That's cool. Oh schedule and free chat. Oh, and she does it for like three years. Oh, okay

Oh, she be do you think you could take her on a fight if you had to be her ass

04:40:15.200 --> 04:40:18.800
Excuse me. I would not harm that shark. Are you kidding me?

04:40:19.600 --> 04:40:24.160
I would treat that shark as a princess mostly because I'm scared of hollow fans

04:40:27.280 --> 04:40:32.160
I'll give you an activity streaming tomorrow in the collab. Is it tomorrow? Yes

04:40:32.880 --> 04:40:36.880
I am in the collab. It's not on my schedule, but I'm there

04:40:38.240 --> 04:40:40.240
What if you had to no?

04:40:40.800 --> 04:40:46.720
I got the majority of the vtuber rabbit hole last year via indy so I learned to follow away after I'm like it I

04:40:47.280 --> 04:40:50.080
It's very interesting to me where people find like

04:40:50.800 --> 04:40:56.560
Agencies or indies before they do the big names. It's but I've noticed that happening a lot more often

04:40:57.440 --> 04:40:59.440
um

04:40:59.840 --> 04:41:01.840
But yeah

04:41:03.040 --> 04:41:05.040
I'm valid

04:41:07.760 --> 04:41:11.040
Hard girl the sush shark kid. She's not sush. She's a shark

04:41:12.080 --> 04:41:16.880
It's the 20th teams. I don't again. I don't remember where I am half the time

04:41:19.680 --> 04:41:24.240
Girl is the first vtuber I watched. Um, yeah, the first vtuber I watched was kazuna ai

04:41:25.200 --> 04:41:29.840
And then I watched co-amigo, but I never really considered her a vtuber. Um

04:41:33.040 --> 04:41:35.040
Let's see. Who else did I watch?

04:41:35.760 --> 04:41:41.920
And I watched a little bit of hollow. I would watch polymyth naturally. Um, I watched kiara

04:41:43.760 --> 04:41:45.760
And then

04:41:45.760 --> 04:41:47.760
I had to stop myself from falling in love with shiwari

04:41:50.560 --> 04:41:54.000
Um, listen, I love messy manhara

04:41:54.720 --> 04:41:56.080
looking types

04:41:56.080 --> 04:41:58.880
If we had a goth chick like that and gen 2

04:41:59.440 --> 04:42:01.440
I would die. Um

04:42:03.840 --> 04:42:09.520
Let's see. Yeah, and then I and then I just watched a lot of agency vtubers like smaller agencies. So like idol

04:44:20.320 --> 04:44:23.120
And I'll honestly be a lair is the first group to pull me off a hollow plant

04:44:24.560 --> 04:44:29.040
I see some words seems like I missed out on some good time staying there for so long

04:44:29.520 --> 04:44:34.160
You know, but it's like it's cool to prevent venture out because like again, I feel like

04:44:35.280 --> 04:44:37.280
It's it's a lot more intimate being

04:44:37.920 --> 04:44:43.520
In a smaller um agency like chat like you can see you can interact with each other

04:44:44.080 --> 04:44:49.280
You probably recognize each other's names. Uh, I can talk to you. I recognize a lot of you

04:44:49.680 --> 04:44:52.080
It's a nice small little chat and we're hanging out

04:44:53.600 --> 04:45:00.320
She used my kamiyoshi. God damn that just weird like it just doesn't make any sense to me that people like me that much

04:45:00.480 --> 04:45:02.480
to call me their kamiyoshi and

04:45:04.000 --> 04:45:08.640
I yeah, I don't even know what to say besides thank you because I just never thought

04:45:09.600 --> 04:45:13.760
Like being like when I was indian never thought anybody would ever tell me that

04:45:16.160 --> 04:45:20.400
Make more 200 rather than 2000. Yeah, I like having small chat

04:45:25.040 --> 04:45:30.880
I only remember you because you keep saying you lost your job and then you went to the other girl's chat and said you lost your job

04:45:32.480 --> 04:45:34.480
And I was like, why are you telling everybody?

04:45:35.440 --> 04:45:42.320
And remember this there's a saying move in silence bro make money moves move in silence

04:45:45.040 --> 04:45:47.920
She don't yeah, and I notice you on other girls chats too. Don't you forget

04:45:50.080 --> 04:45:54.640
More of a casual vtuber fan and watch the content like and the first thing I enjoy don't really have an oshi

04:45:54.720 --> 04:45:57.280
Yeah, exactly. Yeah, like I'm the same way

04:45:58.000 --> 04:46:01.520
Except like there's someone just like I watch the most and that's who I call my oshi

04:46:02.480 --> 04:46:07.680
He lost a new job each time move in silence like lasagna

04:46:08.960 --> 04:46:10.960
Like the gene lasagna

04:46:11.680 --> 04:46:13.680
Like the end of lasagna

04:46:15.040 --> 04:46:17.360
Yeah, identifying you in maros. Oh

04:46:18.640 --> 04:46:20.080
100%

04:46:20.080 --> 04:46:24.160
they'll become a loved and respected figure in the industry. That's very sweet and

04:46:24.960 --> 04:46:26.960
Honestly, that's the goal. I want

04:46:28.160 --> 04:46:30.160
I want to be

04:46:31.040 --> 04:46:32.640
I want to have the same

04:46:32.640 --> 04:46:35.680
I don't it sounds really fucking pretentious when I say this but like

04:46:36.480 --> 04:46:38.480
I really want

04:46:38.480 --> 04:46:40.480
that

04:46:40.480 --> 04:46:42.480
Pull that like the big

04:46:42.960 --> 04:46:44.960
some of the big twitch indies do

04:46:45.680 --> 04:46:46.960
or like

04:46:46.960 --> 04:46:50.320
Like I just I want to be the person that like everybody

04:46:51.440 --> 04:46:56.880
Knows is like cool and chill and you could talk to me and hang out and we can always collab and

04:46:57.840 --> 04:46:59.280
um

04:46:59.280 --> 04:47:03.840
And just like just have a bunch of fucking friends. Like that's all I want. I just want a bunch of fucking friends

04:47:04.720 --> 04:47:06.400
um

04:47:06.400 --> 04:47:10.560
In the industry it would be cool just to like kind of have that sort of

04:47:11.040 --> 04:47:15.440
Like I don't want to be as famous as iron mouse, but like have a sort of like air about me, you know

04:47:17.120 --> 04:47:18.880
Like tomah. Yeah

04:47:18.880 --> 04:47:24.880
Tomah's cool. I love tomah. She sends me tiktoks all the time. I can't keep up with all the tiktok. She sends me

04:47:25.840 --> 04:47:27.840
I

04:47:28.240 --> 04:47:31.840
Knew at a place here. I saw a robot taking the debut. Uh, yeah, I need to rewatch

04:47:31.920 --> 04:47:36.000
I was thinking that because I was cleaning and I was like I found my robotech discs

04:47:36.240 --> 04:47:38.640
And my dad let me and I'm like oh, I need I should rewatch these

04:47:39.120 --> 04:47:41.520
Um, I haven't watched robotech in a very long time

04:47:43.120 --> 04:47:45.360
I already found your cool. So I think you're getting there. Thanks

04:47:46.480 --> 04:47:53.120
Uh, tomah is a tiger. Oh, no, that's uh, toto. Tomah is um a monkey little monkey. Yeah

04:47:54.080 --> 04:48:00.080
Oh, yeah, she'd be a knower. Yeah, that's what I want. And yeah, like I've said this before you're watching the hollow justice debut tomorrow

04:48:00.480 --> 04:48:02.480
Probably I usually wait for them to debut

04:48:03.200 --> 04:48:05.200
Ayo

04:48:06.320 --> 04:48:09.360
Oh, thanks. What the fuck dude?

04:48:11.120 --> 04:48:13.120
You didn't have to do that

04:48:13.200 --> 04:48:14.880
Thank you

04:48:14.880 --> 04:48:19.200
Can we get some can we get some chads in the chat for doki? How they am?

04:48:19.200 --> 04:48:21.200
Oh

04:48:21.440 --> 04:48:28.400
Very nice. Thank you so much. I appreciate that so much. I hope so. I want to make you guys proud. I want to be

04:48:29.680 --> 04:48:33.280
I want to be the best for you for you guys and I want to be the best for the community

04:48:34.000 --> 04:48:36.000
You know, I want to I want to make a difference

04:48:37.680 --> 04:48:41.280
And I know on the way there I'll make mistakes. I'll learn I'll grow and all that stuff

04:48:41.440 --> 04:48:45.120
Fia, what are you doing? She's scratching my chair. But yeah, you know, I want to do that

04:48:45.920 --> 04:48:47.920
um

04:48:48.160 --> 04:48:54.240
Again, my only fear is that people won't want to spend time with the girls and vealer and myself because of the content we do

04:48:54.720 --> 04:48:56.720
We're already feeling it. Um

04:48:57.520 --> 04:48:59.200
for some things

04:48:59.200 --> 04:49:00.160
like

04:49:00.160 --> 04:49:02.160
I really want to be friend

04:49:02.240 --> 04:49:04.240
people and other agencies, but I

04:49:06.240 --> 04:49:08.240
I know that

04:49:08.480 --> 04:49:09.760
because of

04:49:09.760 --> 04:49:12.240
who we are who strani was that

04:49:14.000 --> 04:49:17.280
You know, we might not be afforded some friendships, but yeah

04:49:17.920 --> 04:49:19.920
It is what it is

04:49:20.160 --> 04:49:22.720
uh, it's water under the bridge for all of us, but

04:49:25.680 --> 04:49:27.680
This sucks

04:49:29.280 --> 04:49:32.640
You know, I'm that type of person who I want to be friends with everybody

04:49:34.000 --> 04:49:36.000
Because I have a desire to be liked

04:49:37.840 --> 04:49:41.760
Yeah, yeah, it's just the nature of business. This is the nature of agencies

04:49:42.640 --> 04:49:44.640
um, it's the nature of you know

04:49:45.120 --> 04:49:50.080
Some people seeing us like it was a competition, although I don't really see it that way like they were like, oh

04:49:50.800 --> 04:49:52.800
My melody better my melody

04:49:53.040 --> 04:49:58.160
Uh project melody better watch out for realer. No girl. I just want to learn from her. Are you kidding me?

04:49:59.440 --> 04:50:02.800
This is like I ain't competition to fucking project melody. No

04:50:03.920 --> 04:50:08.080
I don't do half the shit she does. I like to learn how she does her stuff though

04:50:08.160 --> 04:50:12.480
That'd be fucking cool and with con tail VA and all the girls from twitch

04:50:12.800 --> 04:50:14.320
playing

04:50:14.320 --> 04:50:16.320
um

04:50:16.480 --> 04:50:19.360
He's a wild take a while to get on the fucking level, you know

04:50:20.160 --> 04:50:25.920
The only thing that we're doing differently is that we just have naughty ASMR and we say the the quiet shit out loud

04:50:26.000 --> 04:50:28.080
Most of the girl like yeah, that's yeah

04:50:29.040 --> 04:50:31.920
And I'm happy because I thought there was some

04:50:32.800 --> 04:50:36.480
That wouldn't like us, but they they started interacting with us now. So I'm hopeful

04:50:36.880 --> 04:50:38.880
I

04:50:40.640 --> 04:50:43.040
Thank you friends. Did you make you'll be loyal? I hope so

04:50:43.920 --> 04:50:46.880
I don't I'm not again. I said I'm the type of person like if something's wrong

04:50:46.960 --> 04:50:53.120
Like I'll I'll confront somebody so because I hate drama. I just I just want people to be happy

04:50:54.240 --> 04:50:56.720
I just want everybody to be okay and be happy and be friends

04:50:58.400 --> 04:51:04.720
And that's why like I I asked like my gen mates a lot of questions annoyingly like how they're feeling how they're doing

04:51:05.520 --> 04:51:08.640
um, because I just want to make sure we're all on the same page because

04:51:09.760 --> 04:51:12.880
uh, I just want to make sure that they're okay and

04:51:14.480 --> 04:51:19.120
Like everybody's doing all right because I care about them. I care about how they're feeling how their mental health is

04:51:20.160 --> 04:51:25.920
Um, you had your fill of trauma there. Yeah, exactly. Yeah being a commentator was

04:51:27.440 --> 04:51:29.440
very stressful it was

04:51:30.640 --> 04:51:34.240
I can't even explain to you how stressful it was just like the hate

04:51:35.680 --> 04:51:37.680
um

04:51:37.920 --> 04:51:41.040
The shit that I went through dealing with people

04:51:42.080 --> 04:51:47.200
And it's funny because now I get to see them get karma now that are in the con that were in the commentary community

04:51:47.280 --> 04:51:49.280
And it's it's very nice to see it

04:51:51.360 --> 04:51:54.080
People who treated me like shit, um

04:51:55.120 --> 04:51:58.080
Just for being a girl trying to do shit

04:51:59.120 --> 04:52:00.400
uh

04:52:00.400 --> 04:52:05.280
Should be doing wellness checks I do though like I'm like I did that at my job too before I left

04:52:05.360 --> 04:52:07.680
Like I would check in with everybody and be like, hey, how are you doing?

04:52:08.400 --> 04:52:12.320
Or if somebody seemed down I'm like tell me what's up and they're just like I'm fine. I'm like don't fucking lie to me

04:52:14.080 --> 04:52:17.520
When you get bigger friends aren't just friends business relationship from what I've heard

04:52:18.080 --> 04:52:20.080
But like I don't want that

04:52:20.480 --> 04:52:22.480
if like I don't

04:52:22.800 --> 04:52:26.000
I don't see collabs as like a business transaction

04:52:26.240 --> 04:52:30.560
Unless they explicitly say this is a business transaction

04:52:31.520 --> 04:52:34.720
um, I will probably only collab with people that

04:52:35.360 --> 04:52:41.280
I like I am acquaintances with or I am on friendly terms or I do consider my friends or my best friends

04:52:42.080 --> 04:52:43.200
um

04:52:43.200 --> 04:52:47.440
Because like I want to hang out with you. I don't want anything from you

04:52:48.320 --> 04:52:50.320
You know like I don't

04:52:51.440 --> 04:52:53.440
I'm not doing this

04:52:53.680 --> 04:52:57.520
For like monetary gain or popularity

04:52:58.160 --> 04:52:59.360
like if

04:52:59.360 --> 04:53:02.720
If a big ass vtuber was like, hey, you want to hang out

04:53:03.600 --> 04:53:06.800
I'd mostly be fucking sides because this person wants to hang out with me

04:53:06.880 --> 04:53:10.880
I don't care about their audience size like and same thing for me

04:53:11.040 --> 04:53:19.360
Like I don't care if you have only five people watching you if I know you're cool. I watch your streams. I've you know like

04:53:19.920 --> 04:53:24.560
I'll hang out with you. Like, you know, like I'm not gonna let that stand in the way

04:53:24.640 --> 04:53:26.720
It isn't a business transaction to me

04:53:26.720 --> 04:53:33.920
But again, I respect the people who do believe that like I'm not gonna be like oh my god. You're just a bitch. No, that's stupid

04:53:34.320 --> 04:53:37.360
Everybody's entitled to like how they go about things. Um

04:53:38.080 --> 04:53:43.360
If I were to to collab with like some girls from other agency and they're like

04:53:43.920 --> 04:53:48.720
We're doing this because management told us to I'd be like ow, but okay

04:53:50.320 --> 04:53:54.560
Let's then I'll try to have the best fun that I can. I don't that's not hasn't happened

04:53:54.640 --> 04:53:59.200
So I don't think that's happened. It has not happened, but like it's just this is the hypothetical. Um

04:54:00.800 --> 04:54:02.800
It's time to start streaming so

04:54:04.640 --> 04:54:06.640
Um, am I fine? Um

04:54:08.160 --> 04:54:10.000
I'm okay

04:54:10.000 --> 04:54:14.320
Like again, I'm very honest with you guys. So like I've been in a little bit of pain for my fibro

04:54:15.040 --> 04:54:17.040
I've had a couple headaches

04:54:17.040 --> 04:54:18.400
um

04:54:18.400 --> 04:54:20.400
It's been tough

04:54:21.520 --> 04:54:24.240
Leaving my job. I don't really think it's settled in yet

04:54:25.440 --> 04:54:29.680
because I've been there for almost six years that job meant so much to me and

04:54:30.720 --> 04:54:34.240
Saying goodbye to people was hard. I'm surprised I didn't cry. Um

04:54:36.080 --> 04:54:38.080
It I'm not good with change

04:54:39.200 --> 04:54:41.440
and what worries me the most is

04:54:42.560 --> 04:54:44.560
I tend to get really isolated

04:54:45.520 --> 04:54:47.520
And so I was only going back to work

04:54:47.920 --> 04:54:53.280
So that I wouldn't isolate myself and self isolate because I tend to do that when I'm I'm feeling down

04:54:54.080 --> 04:54:55.360
um

04:54:55.360 --> 04:54:56.560
but

04:54:56.560 --> 04:55:00.480
I realized I was just feeling more tortured being there like I was

04:55:01.280 --> 04:55:03.680
Really starting to resent the work I was doing

04:55:05.680 --> 04:55:08.080
Um, but otherwise I'm fine like

04:55:08.800 --> 04:55:15.040
Yeah, like I miss hanging out my parents. I need to go see them. I did hang out with them a couple days ago

04:55:15.120 --> 04:55:20.720
But yeah, I need to hang out with my friends. I was supposed to hang out with Salem, but I didn't feel good. Um

04:55:21.760 --> 04:55:23.520
I needed to sleep

04:55:23.520 --> 04:55:25.520
I didn't go over her house

04:55:26.720 --> 04:55:30.720
And then like so yeah, my goals are really just to leave my house

04:55:31.280 --> 04:55:36.000
Because I tend I like I have been agoraphobic in the past where I didn't leave my house for six months

04:55:36.480 --> 04:55:40.800
And that wasn't good for me. It really wasn't it's not good for anybody humans humans are

04:55:43.040 --> 04:55:48.400
Humans are pack creatures. We need to talk to we're very we need to hang out with other people

04:55:48.480 --> 04:55:49.920
And that's I like I

04:55:49.920 --> 04:55:53.040
V-Jubing does give me energy because I can talk to you guys

04:55:53.120 --> 04:55:55.920
But sometimes it's good to be face-to-face with people, you know

04:55:58.000 --> 04:56:00.000
Um

04:56:00.000 --> 04:56:02.000
I

04:56:03.600 --> 04:56:07.680
Left my old job the first week was just a haze. It's up the best that we're had in previous eight years

04:56:08.080 --> 04:56:10.480
Uh for me, I've haven't I've been sleeping like fucking shit

04:56:11.280 --> 04:56:13.280
I've only been sleeping a couple hours

04:56:13.520 --> 04:56:14.720
Uh

04:56:14.720 --> 04:56:17.440
I can't stay asleep. I have really fucking weird dreams

04:56:18.480 --> 04:56:22.480
Um, and I'm a very lucid dreamer so I remember every fucking dream I have. Um

04:56:23.760 --> 04:56:27.920
Yeah, it's just I'm in a weird state. I'm just I just feel I just feel off

04:56:28.880 --> 04:56:33.840
You know mercury's and Gatorade. No, I have no idea fucking retreat mercury's and retrograde. Um

04:56:34.960 --> 04:56:39.120
It's weird dreams. No, not the not the fun dreams. I have had a couple though

04:56:43.280 --> 04:56:45.440
Sorry, I'm stretching. Um

04:56:47.760 --> 04:56:49.520
Let me make a day and just go outside

04:56:49.520 --> 04:56:55.760
Yeah, and like that's why like it took so much energy from me just to fucking go to the grocery store today

04:56:55.760 --> 04:57:01.840
That's why I know that like I need to be outside more. Um, also it was just really hard carrying everything up

04:57:03.920 --> 04:57:06.800
I've it I it's hard to carry groceries

04:57:07.920 --> 04:57:09.920
several flights

04:57:09.920 --> 04:57:11.600
um

04:57:11.600 --> 04:57:19.520
And then I had to drag my bed frame upstairs and that shit is probably like fucking 50 pounds and

04:57:20.480 --> 04:57:25.760
And I swear every time I picked up picked it up. I was getting abs and really buff

04:57:27.680 --> 04:57:31.200
And then yeah, yeah, and even in terms of like streaming stuff. Um

04:57:33.040 --> 04:57:40.240
It's it's a new thing to have so many eyes on me. I'm used to having like a concurrent viewership of

04:57:42.480 --> 04:57:44.480
Like 30 people

04:57:44.560 --> 04:57:46.560
like max

04:57:46.560 --> 04:57:48.560
50

04:57:48.560 --> 04:57:52.240
I remember on my debut when I debuted as Rena with my little chibi model

04:57:52.320 --> 04:57:58.480
I got rated with 200 people and I will chat myself and now I have a concurrent viewership of that. So it's very

04:57:59.200 --> 04:58:02.400
It's very weird adjusting to it the amount of attention

04:58:03.120 --> 04:58:04.480
that I get

04:58:04.480 --> 04:58:06.480
um

04:58:06.560 --> 04:58:10.560
I'm used to kind of passing under the radar and kind of being the support

04:58:11.200 --> 04:58:13.200
in the shadows type

04:58:13.840 --> 04:58:18.080
Like I I'm always there to like lend a helping hand but to be on the forefront

04:58:18.720 --> 04:58:23.440
It's very interesting. It's a very new experience to me. I think I'm handling it. Okay

04:58:24.080 --> 04:58:28.480
The first week was a little bit rocky. Um, you know, I said some stupid shit

04:58:29.520 --> 04:58:33.200
Uh, oh my god, Rena. What the fuck Rena? Can you go lay in your bed? Please?

04:58:33.760 --> 04:58:37.440
Okay. Well, never mind. Ow. We just stepped on my tit. Thanks. I love that

04:58:38.240 --> 04:58:40.240
Thank you for stomping on my nipple

04:58:41.760 --> 04:58:45.920
Um mirror about me here and I'm happy. Oh, that's nice. Mara is such a sweetheart

04:58:46.480 --> 04:58:52.560
Me and my plus girls are such sweethearts. We have a collab with them next week spoiler. Um, can't wait

04:58:53.440 --> 04:58:55.440
uh

04:58:55.520 --> 04:58:58.400
But yeah, now you're the protagonist it's like

04:58:59.840 --> 04:59:01.840
Literally though, it's like I'm like, oh

04:59:02.160 --> 04:59:07.520
Joining the alert would never happen to me because that's like a dream come true and like that would be a fairy tale and

04:59:07.920 --> 04:59:12.720
A lot of my problems would be solved if this happened and then it happened and doesn't feel real

04:59:13.280 --> 04:59:15.280
still like it feels

04:59:15.280 --> 04:59:17.280
Like I'm gonna dream and I'm gonna wake up and

04:59:17.920 --> 04:59:20.560
Be disappointed that I'm still stuck at my fucking job

04:59:22.560 --> 04:59:25.760
But then I pinch myself and I have to remember that I'm here

04:59:26.640 --> 04:59:29.760
As we discover you may plus they're pretty cool. Yeah, they're so sweet

04:59:30.240 --> 04:59:32.000
They deserve a lot more

04:59:32.000 --> 04:59:36.240
Viewership than they do like they they do. They're so talented. They're so funny

04:59:36.880 --> 04:59:38.880
Most is a fucking right

04:59:38.960 --> 04:59:41.040
Um, should have been me not him

04:59:42.000 --> 04:59:46.080
I love you. Oh fucking where'd you come from bitch? She's just coming out of nowhere

04:59:47.840 --> 04:59:49.840
She's just like me you my plus mention

04:59:51.760 --> 04:59:54.480
Um, I don't know you too and

04:59:55.360 --> 05:00:00.000
I've been here. Oh, yeah, I we talked like 20 minutes ago. You just lurking. She's lurking

05:00:00.640 --> 05:00:05.920
Um, yeah, the most uh, the most of sliding in my dm. She's like, hey, you want to be friends and I'm like, yeah, bitch

05:00:06.960 --> 05:00:08.960
I love that shit. That's my favorite

05:00:09.280 --> 05:00:10.640
um

05:00:10.640 --> 05:00:12.160
She's cool as hell

05:00:12.160 --> 05:00:14.160
Please don't wake up. We'll stop existing

05:00:16.240 --> 05:00:18.960
Hey, most of her bad mouth. Thank you. Um

05:00:20.000 --> 05:00:22.880
Yeah, bad mouth thing about how much of a bad bitch you are

05:00:23.600 --> 05:00:26.640
Uh, we all the girls are sweet. Um

05:00:30.240 --> 05:00:35.120
Yeah, it's just it's and then also like dealing with hate has been interesting

05:00:35.920 --> 05:00:37.920
um as a vtuber

05:00:38.480 --> 05:00:46.960
It is a lot more manageable because as a commentator, I was like hit every day with that shit. So it was pretty desensitized

05:00:48.400 --> 05:00:50.400
um, and I think

05:00:51.040 --> 05:00:53.040
I've learned over time

05:00:53.920 --> 05:00:55.920
to handle hate better

05:00:56.080 --> 05:00:57.600
um

05:00:57.600 --> 05:01:03.680
But then sometimes I'm like, I do get baited and I respond to trolls like I'll admit that I can be stupid like that sometimes

05:01:04.560 --> 05:01:11.520
Um, mostly because I'm trying to be out of the goodness of my heart answer like an on what I think is an honest question when it isn't

05:01:12.320 --> 05:01:13.360
um

05:01:13.360 --> 05:01:14.560
or

05:01:14.560 --> 05:01:16.560
or a

05:01:16.560 --> 05:01:18.560
Yeah, or um

05:01:18.560 --> 05:01:21.040
respond to something that I think is genuine, but

05:01:22.320 --> 05:01:26.240
A genuine critique, but then I'm like, oh wait, no, it's not my back is cheap

05:01:28.000 --> 05:01:30.000
um

05:01:31.040 --> 05:01:33.040
Yeah, I just

05:01:34.400 --> 05:01:36.000
Hmm

05:01:36.000 --> 05:01:39.680
Like I'm learning not like when I don't like something I don't need to acknowledge it

05:01:41.120 --> 05:01:46.400
When something bothers me don't want to just block and move on. That's it's really interesting

05:01:53.600 --> 05:01:55.840
We're stroding your chat. That's pretty good

05:01:56.720 --> 05:02:03.280
Yeah, don't feed the trolls. Yeah, and it's like because I'm like I'm a little fucking brat and bitch sometimes sometimes I'll bait the trolls

05:02:03.280 --> 05:02:05.280
I've done that before and I'm like

05:02:05.600 --> 05:02:09.840
Um, what I did that before is Rina and I'm like, oh fuck should have done that

05:02:11.360 --> 05:02:16.640
But you live you learn and you live whatever the fuck you make mistakes that you fucking learned from them

05:02:17.280 --> 05:02:19.120
um

05:02:19.120 --> 05:02:21.120
and that's what

05:02:21.680 --> 05:02:23.680
I think like

05:02:24.480 --> 05:02:29.760
What we do as a company it's like we'll make like a small mistake and then we'll adjust accordingly

05:02:30.240 --> 05:02:32.240
um

05:02:33.120 --> 05:02:35.120
And we haven't made a lot of those

05:02:36.880 --> 05:02:38.480
But

05:02:38.480 --> 05:02:41.600
I can't wait to see how we'll grow. I think we have a

05:02:42.880 --> 05:02:49.520
We'll be learning a lot at least as a company because I've never worked in a group as a company before like an agency

05:02:50.000 --> 05:02:51.120
um

05:02:51.120 --> 05:02:58.640
And of course I've worked in many groups like and I've managed teams when I was in the training when I was in my job

05:02:59.120 --> 05:03:00.320
um

05:03:00.320 --> 05:03:02.320
So it's it's interesting to kind of

05:03:03.440 --> 05:03:06.640
I really like just being able to support scrawny in her dream

05:03:07.440 --> 05:03:07.920
um

05:03:07.920 --> 05:03:14.480
And also be able to make my own content and like just like her giving me the green light on things and projects that I want

05:03:14.480 --> 05:03:18.400
To do has been really cool. Um, I don't know if any of the girls have anything planned

05:03:18.960 --> 05:03:23.600
But like I would support them if they did something and they asked me to be a part of it or they just wanted support

05:03:24.480 --> 05:03:27.840
So it's it's it's nice. It's it is really nice

05:03:29.600 --> 05:03:33.680
I'm learning to let things go. Yeah, like I don't hold on to things

05:03:34.800 --> 05:03:37.920
I realize uh, I think that's a skill I have

05:03:39.040 --> 05:03:41.040
I I don't hold grudges

05:03:41.040 --> 05:03:43.040
um

05:03:43.360 --> 05:03:46.800
Yeah, pretty optimistic about people there. Yeah, me too

05:03:47.680 --> 05:03:49.680
scrawny stream is my dream exactly

05:03:50.720 --> 05:03:52.720
exactly

05:03:52.800 --> 05:03:55.520
I really think viewers gonna be big one day. Yeah

05:03:56.400 --> 05:03:58.400
I can't wait till we like

05:03:59.520 --> 05:04:02.960
Like I want to be the V show joe for whores. Like I want to be like

05:04:05.200 --> 05:04:07.200
I want to just be able to like nepo

05:04:07.760 --> 05:04:11.440
Scout fucking huge lude tubers and be like come be a whore with us

05:04:14.000 --> 05:04:16.000
Be fucking hilarious

05:04:16.800 --> 05:04:22.160
Um, but yeah, like I know scrawny has a lot planned for us deals sponsorships

05:04:22.160 --> 05:04:26.320
She's she literally wants the best for us and I couldn't ask for a better mom

05:04:27.280 --> 05:04:29.280
A better vtuber mom

05:04:29.440 --> 05:04:30.640
uh

05:04:30.640 --> 05:04:34.400
The pop-up and pop cherries. Oh god, but um

05:04:35.440 --> 05:04:37.040
Yeah, it's just

05:04:37.040 --> 05:04:39.440
It's really cool. I'm very thankful

05:04:40.240 --> 05:04:42.240
It's really nice hanging out with you guys

05:04:42.880 --> 05:04:45.840
Too small be a lure be the whole live of vtuber lude tubers

05:04:46.480 --> 05:04:50.320
I don't want that though. Like I don't want to be whole live of lude tubers

05:04:52.240 --> 05:04:54.240
Um

05:04:54.320 --> 05:04:56.320
Yeah

05:04:56.560 --> 05:04:59.760
I'm trying to throw cops caught until vk. That'd be cool

05:05:02.000 --> 05:05:04.640
Be like it was her she was queen in my lure

05:05:06.240 --> 05:05:08.000
Um

05:05:08.000 --> 05:05:11.600
I don't want to be that big because I was thinking about it because I was just like, okay

05:05:13.040 --> 05:05:15.040
Like what if

05:05:15.680 --> 05:05:17.680
um

05:05:19.680 --> 05:05:23.840
And don't take this the wrong way this hypothetical that I thought of it was only because

05:05:24.320 --> 05:05:26.080
the girl the

05:05:26.080 --> 05:05:27.280
the

05:05:27.280 --> 05:05:32.320
Debuts popped up that I thought of this and not in a negative way. Just like how would I handle it?

05:05:32.560 --> 05:05:34.560
I'm like, okay. Let's say

05:05:34.560 --> 05:05:36.560
in like four years

05:05:37.680 --> 05:05:39.680
For three years velar

05:05:39.760 --> 05:05:41.760
um

05:05:42.000 --> 05:05:44.000
Ended operations

05:05:44.000 --> 05:05:45.440
I'm like

05:05:45.440 --> 05:05:47.440
Would I try to get in the hall alive? No

05:05:48.880 --> 05:05:50.880
One because the content I make

05:05:51.360 --> 05:05:53.360
two because of all the eyes on me

05:05:54.080 --> 05:05:55.120
uh

05:05:55.120 --> 05:05:56.640
three

05:05:56.640 --> 05:05:59.280
I don't think I'm entertaining enough and like I don't

05:06:00.560 --> 05:06:06.400
I don't know. I just like being small. I just like I that's why I hope velar lasts forever because I just want it

05:06:08.320 --> 05:06:11.920
I don't know how to explain it, but I hope you guys like understand what I'm saying. It wasn't it's not

05:06:18.720 --> 05:06:20.720
I don't care about the money

05:06:21.360 --> 05:06:25.200
Either that's not a motivation. It's nice. It's an added perk

05:06:26.000 --> 05:06:27.760
like

05:06:27.760 --> 05:06:29.280
but

05:06:29.280 --> 05:06:30.880
I

05:06:30.880 --> 05:06:32.160
For me

05:06:32.160 --> 05:06:37.360
Being a streamer was my passion into what makes brings me joy and makes me happy if I and then I was

05:06:38.160 --> 05:06:41.200
So fucking miserable when I wasn't streaming for the last few years

05:06:41.840 --> 05:06:46.880
It was so fucking shitty. I realized how much I missed it when I when I was rena

05:06:47.200 --> 05:06:47.920
um

05:06:47.920 --> 05:06:49.360
when I became

05:06:49.360 --> 05:06:54.880
When I did my first stream as rena, I realized how much I missed it and then when I had to be

05:06:55.840 --> 05:06:58.320
Quiet and be underground for a couple of months

05:06:59.040 --> 05:07:02.000
Uh while I was transforming into my ultimate form shiwi

05:07:02.320 --> 05:07:08.640
I was literally dying inside because I missed talking to my community. I missed talking to people. I missed making stuff

05:07:09.280 --> 05:07:14.720
Because uh, like I had so many plans and I'm like, oh my god. Like I just wanted to get shit done. Um

05:07:15.600 --> 05:07:21.600
It was a core profile. No, no, no. I was never in an agency before this. Uh, I was indy. I was a twitch indy

05:07:22.400 --> 05:07:24.400
Very small twitch indy

05:07:24.720 --> 05:07:26.720
um

05:07:27.120 --> 05:07:31.120
I do and I already said this stream I caught until VA collab would go hard. Yes, it would

05:07:31.120 --> 05:07:33.360
I don't know if she would want to talk to me though

05:07:34.800 --> 05:07:36.800
Again, I'm so small

05:07:36.800 --> 05:07:40.240
Oh, I'm gonna tell you when you're for five hours. Has it been five hours or shit?

05:07:41.200 --> 05:07:44.000
I get it. We could be more comfy this way and it gives you flexibility. Yeah

05:07:44.640 --> 05:07:48.080
The dichotomy between wanting success and wanting a nice small community. Yeah

05:07:48.800 --> 05:07:50.800
Like I could always get a job

05:07:50.800 --> 05:07:52.480
like

05:07:52.480 --> 05:07:58.400
Worst comes to worst. I could get a job if like I wasn't making enough streaming and like that's fine

05:07:58.480 --> 05:08:01.440
I'm up as long as I get to stream. That's all I care about

05:08:02.000 --> 05:08:06.480
She loves us. I do. I'll say it. I love you guys. I love streaming

05:08:07.600 --> 05:08:08.880
Fuck you

05:08:08.880 --> 05:08:10.160
Bitch

05:08:10.160 --> 05:08:12.160
Don't let it get to your head

05:08:13.360 --> 05:08:17.520
Contale would simp for you on god. I highly doubt that I'd be simping for her

05:08:19.920 --> 05:08:27.440
Overgrowth with the selfish part of me hopes. Oh you guys fucking talk her so fast. Um, it's the most like this intimate vibes are immaculate

05:08:27.440 --> 05:08:28.240
Yeah

05:08:28.240 --> 05:08:31.680
And like yeah, that's why like I've seen a lot of people have that same sentiment

05:08:32.080 --> 05:08:38.160
Like they want us to be successful, but they want you want to get keep us a little and so I totally understand that

05:08:39.840 --> 05:08:42.320
Um, but then

05:08:43.360 --> 05:08:49.760
Then you think and I know you guys think this like why would I want to stop somebody else from experiencing what I'm experiencing right now?

05:08:50.320 --> 05:08:53.360
What if she helps somebody or what if

05:08:54.080 --> 05:08:55.280
like

05:08:55.280 --> 05:09:00.480
She brings a smile to somebody having a bad day. That's what I want you to remember when you you think like that

05:09:01.120 --> 05:09:02.480
um

05:09:02.480 --> 05:09:06.560
Like what if we bring so much change to the vtuber community then another

05:09:07.520 --> 05:09:11.120
Agency pops up that does similar content to ours and you find you're

05:09:11.920 --> 05:09:19.360
The fucking love of your life in comey in comeyoshi and that one or like what if like because so many so many things can happen

05:09:19.440 --> 05:09:21.280
like you can branch and

05:09:21.280 --> 05:09:22.800
you know

05:09:22.800 --> 05:09:23.920
all that

05:09:23.920 --> 05:09:25.920
Still keeping my ego in check. Don't worry

05:09:26.400 --> 05:09:28.880
Uh intimate chats of the soul. So yeah

05:09:29.680 --> 05:09:35.600
I like about vtuber is the chat interaction, which is why I like indie so much. Yeah, I loved I liked I like streaming

05:09:36.320 --> 05:09:43.840
Because I love doing chat interaction. That's why I'm frustrated with youtube because it's it's hard to do a lot of chat interaction

05:09:43.840 --> 05:09:45.840
That's my like channel points on twitch

05:09:46.560 --> 05:09:47.840
um

05:09:47.840 --> 05:09:49.840
Have a plan make it easy

05:09:50.400 --> 05:09:52.400
on her to destroy a thing

05:09:52.400 --> 05:09:53.440
yeah

05:09:53.440 --> 05:09:55.440
I did like um

05:09:55.440 --> 05:09:57.440
I want to be part of honey kins

05:09:58.000 --> 05:10:03.840
Like murder mystery thing that she has going she needs like 15 vtubers for it. So I was like, please please

05:10:04.720 --> 05:10:06.720
um

05:10:07.440 --> 05:10:13.520
Yeah, I like I'm afraid to ask people to hang out because I don't want to seem like I'm clout chasing because I just

05:10:14.720 --> 05:10:18.480
It's just that now that I'm an agency vtuber with a brand

05:10:18.960 --> 05:10:22.160
People are more likely to say yes because if I was a fucking indie

05:10:22.160 --> 05:10:23.840
No one would say yes to hanging out with me

05:10:23.840 --> 05:10:27.760
I don't want to hang out because I want popularity. I just want to hang out because I think your content's cool

05:10:28.560 --> 05:10:36.320
So I'm like, oh if I slide into a k like so and so's dms. Are they gonna think I'm a clout chasing leechy bitch?

05:10:36.400 --> 05:10:38.080
I'm like, I hope not

05:10:38.080 --> 05:10:40.560
I just want to hang out with you because I think you you and your content is cool

05:10:42.160 --> 05:10:44.160
Felt yeah

05:10:44.560 --> 05:10:46.400
um

05:10:46.400 --> 05:10:48.400
I don't yeah, I just don't want

05:10:49.280 --> 05:10:54.000
I want to make connections, but it's it's it's it that's what holds me back

05:10:54.800 --> 05:11:00.880
Um, and then when I feel a little bit stupid when like someone doesn't respond and I know they've seen it

05:11:01.600 --> 05:11:04.640
But I'm like, hey, it's it is what it is. Like I can't

05:11:05.680 --> 05:11:11.600
Change how they feel if like they're like, oh, I don't like her. She's kind of like and she's fucking

05:11:12.960 --> 05:11:18.800
Because I know like another thing people are like, um, some people are put off about I've heard somebody say that

05:11:19.040 --> 05:11:19.840
um

05:11:19.920 --> 05:11:22.400
My model makes them uncomfortable, which makes me kind of sad

05:11:22.800 --> 05:11:27.600
But I understand because like if you're not into bdsm and I have a fucking ball gag as a choker and

05:11:28.160 --> 05:11:31.280
Uh shabari ropes and my boobs are a fucking huge, you know

05:11:31.840 --> 05:11:33.600
um

05:11:33.600 --> 05:11:39.600
And some people don't like a very sexualized. Why am I so small because I'm because I'm fucking

05:11:44.480 --> 05:11:46.480
Because I'm leaning back

05:11:50.320 --> 05:11:52.960
Here I'll lean I'll lean nice and close to you. I'm so short

05:11:54.240 --> 05:11:57.920
I'm like trying to do this and lean but also like move myself up

05:11:59.520 --> 05:12:03.040
So I can like yeah, okay, that's a little bit better. Um

05:12:05.360 --> 05:12:07.360
Oh, this is scared of the drills

05:12:07.760 --> 05:12:13.840
Reach out just bring a plant. Yeah here with the um big bobs scare you. Oh, well stay away from big bobs

05:12:14.560 --> 05:12:16.560
so short

05:12:17.040 --> 05:12:21.920
Yeah, I think my model is amazing too. Like when I saw it the first time I was like my mouth fucking dropped

05:12:22.320 --> 05:12:27.520
I wish I was on a video call with strawnee because then she would have been laughing at me. Um,

05:12:28.080 --> 05:12:30.080
What do you mean that is inside?

05:12:32.800 --> 05:12:36.880
I'm scared you were personalities. I don't know maybe that's why that's why I'm like

05:12:37.360 --> 05:12:40.880
I debate so often if I should really reel myself in

05:12:41.680 --> 05:12:43.680
Because I don't want to put people off

05:12:44.400 --> 05:12:46.000
Um

05:12:46.000 --> 05:12:51.200
These people just want to hang out through the ones to be valid. Yeah, that's why I fucking love that you may plus girls so much

05:12:51.200 --> 05:12:53.200
Because they gave us a chance, you know

05:12:53.600 --> 05:12:55.200
They're like, yeah

05:12:55.200 --> 05:13:01.760
Um, and I know like sponsored watch alongs don't uh mean anything when it comes to like lasting relationships in the v2

05:13:01.760 --> 05:13:06.400
Bing community, but we were turned down by a lot of agencies. Um for that

05:13:06.880 --> 05:13:11.360
And I can say that strawnee's already fucking talked about it. Um, but you may plus was like yeah

05:13:11.840 --> 05:13:14.000
And like it was really fucking cool of them to accept

05:13:14.720 --> 05:13:17.840
Because we're nobody's yeah, we have a little bit of pull because

05:13:18.720 --> 05:13:21.200
of just like the content we make but

05:13:22.400 --> 05:13:25.920
We're still a brand risk being not safe for work. That's why

05:13:31.760 --> 05:13:38.640
Feel silly when there's so many skimpy jiggly models of the gags curious people. Yeah, yeah, you know, I think

05:13:39.360 --> 05:13:40.400
I

05:13:40.400 --> 05:13:42.400
Yeah, I I feel like

05:13:42.800 --> 05:13:44.800
I I think

05:13:44.960 --> 05:13:49.440
In like a couple months will be a little bit more settled in. We love you girls. We love you too

05:13:50.160 --> 05:13:52.480
Um before mariah coming in college too

05:13:53.200 --> 05:13:59.920
Honestly, yeah, like I was chatting in rem's chat. Um, I've been like making funny jokes with uh,

05:14:00.720 --> 05:14:02.720
nova

05:14:03.200 --> 05:14:10.560
So like I'm like they're the v4 mariah girls are so fucking cool to me to be honest, uh, their debuts

05:14:11.360 --> 05:14:16.720
Honestly blew me out of the fucking water like all like all their debuts so far and before mariah

05:14:17.360 --> 05:14:19.360
Um have blew me out of the water

05:14:19.360 --> 05:14:23.040
Um, I remember watching serena's the first time when they actually made the company

05:14:23.520 --> 05:14:26.320
Her singing voice was amazing. I

05:14:26.320 --> 05:14:27.440
I

05:14:27.440 --> 05:14:34.320
Was so amazed by it and then just the newer girls their debuts are so creative

05:14:34.800 --> 05:14:37.760
They're such a creative group. Um, they're such a such a nice

05:14:38.640 --> 05:14:39.920
bunch of people

05:14:39.920 --> 05:14:40.880
um

05:14:40.880 --> 05:14:46.800
And the mythos girls are also you have fucking facade and rated me the other day and I was like, oh shit, okay

05:14:47.680 --> 05:14:48.960
That's cool

05:14:48.960 --> 05:14:50.080
and that

05:14:50.080 --> 05:14:56.160
And that like and I always see like as a raid a raid as like a little olive branch like hey, please like

05:14:56.480 --> 05:14:58.480
I like you. I want to send my

05:14:59.280 --> 05:15:02.000
My viewers to you and I always appreciate that

05:15:02.640 --> 05:15:05.600
Um, I miss abby kiddo. Oh, yeah same she

05:15:07.040 --> 05:15:10.720
It's a real bummer, but I'm proud of her. Um, because she

05:15:11.280 --> 05:15:17.920
Got an opportunity, but she was honestly doing things that a lot of people did not do in the community in terms of skits

05:15:18.640 --> 05:15:22.480
Um, and just her format and I thought that was very unique about her

05:15:23.040 --> 05:15:25.760
Uh, and then yeah her and biscotti

05:15:26.240 --> 05:15:27.680
um

05:15:27.680 --> 05:15:31.200
Very talented people, but you know when life affords you

05:15:32.160 --> 05:15:37.280
Amazing opportunities. You gotta you gotta get them and it's amazing that brave group allows them to do so

05:15:37.760 --> 05:15:39.520
so

05:15:39.520 --> 05:15:44.720
The scientist debut was insanely. You're not to the yes. Like I was like, what the fuck is this? This is crazy

05:15:45.280 --> 05:15:49.440
Um, yeah, raids raids are nice. The the redirects are cool

05:15:50.720 --> 05:15:53.680
I'm sorry with costume for the lore moment. Remind me of the moment from the

05:15:55.120 --> 05:16:03.200
Um, yeah, I was laughing at uh, alias is v2 apology thing. I was dying at that actually that was really funny. Um

05:16:05.440 --> 05:16:08.640
Came in from that raid. Oh, okay. That's funny. That's cool

05:16:09.600 --> 05:16:15.840
Sounds like she found a little path into comedy. Yeah, I mean, I I generally I'm wondering what she got into like it

05:16:16.640 --> 05:16:19.120
It for her to leave, but you know

05:16:19.760 --> 05:16:21.280
It's very interesting

05:16:21.280 --> 05:16:28.240
I mean it was and also like she was so great to her portuguese fan base her brazilian fan base. I really think

05:16:29.040 --> 05:16:31.840
um, she really paved the way for um

05:16:34.000 --> 05:16:36.000
Brazilian vtubers

05:16:36.560 --> 05:16:38.560
Oh

05:16:41.440 --> 05:16:45.680
Yeah, I hope I hope yeah, I hope the girls are okay. Um in her leaving

05:16:46.640 --> 05:16:53.120
And I just yeah, I just wonder what will be next for a lot of the smaller agencies in the community

05:16:53.920 --> 05:16:55.680
um

05:16:55.680 --> 05:16:57.040
like

05:16:57.040 --> 05:16:59.440
Yeah, pixeling just debuted around the same time as us

05:17:00.400 --> 05:17:02.400
um

05:17:03.120 --> 05:17:09.520
What was it isn't like idle doing another gen or um, or was that or did I see that in a dream?

05:17:10.080 --> 05:17:12.080
I can't remember. Um

05:17:13.120 --> 05:17:17.200
I know they did like uh idle. Yes, which was really fucking cool

05:17:19.680 --> 05:17:23.200
I'm brazilian. That was so cool. Yeah, like she she always

05:17:23.840 --> 05:17:28.720
I always appreciated that she always did her her tweets in english and in portuguese

05:17:29.440 --> 05:17:31.440
I'll on core. Yeah

05:17:31.760 --> 05:17:37.040
Yeah, no not on core. Uh, the gen three. Yes the gen three. Okay. I'm not I'm not going insane

05:17:37.760 --> 05:17:39.920
Uh, so I I look forward to their debuts, too

05:17:41.280 --> 05:17:43.280
I'll be a little shiblit

05:17:44.000 --> 05:17:46.240
Shiblit. I like that. I should have called you my shiblits

05:17:47.520 --> 05:17:49.520
Sounds like shitlits

05:17:49.680 --> 05:17:52.640
Sounds like cheek lays cheeklets cheek lays

05:17:53.840 --> 05:17:57.760
You may know one day she has a recognizable voice. Oh, you know, she definitely does

05:17:58.960 --> 05:18:00.480
um

05:18:00.480 --> 05:18:01.760
She fucking

05:18:01.760 --> 05:18:04.160
Imagine she shows up in fucking holo. Holy

05:18:06.400 --> 05:18:10.240
That's like the chaser. I would lose my fucking mind. Um

05:18:11.840 --> 05:18:13.840
Same brain so yeah

05:18:13.840 --> 05:18:16.560
Me and mercy say to share the same brain cells so often

05:18:17.120 --> 05:18:20.320
Like I think it's like so many times we've like gone to

05:18:20.960 --> 05:18:25.120
Like message each other and we're like, oh shit wait and because like I was about to talk to you

05:18:25.360 --> 05:18:28.400
And then like we'll talk about like the same thing at the same time

05:18:28.960 --> 05:18:31.760
In the our journal part of the discord and we're just like

05:18:36.480 --> 05:18:41.360
People with theorizing about holo and it happens. It'll be so reactive like live tweeting. Yeah

05:18:43.680 --> 05:18:50.880
Yeah, um, I kind of feel like with one of them being a really former high profile

05:18:51.920 --> 05:18:53.040
um

05:18:53.120 --> 05:18:55.120
Artist in indie I feel like

05:18:56.800 --> 05:18:58.800
That this

05:18:59.200 --> 05:19:04.880
Honestly, this has started happening a couple months ago though. Everybody's kind of been talking about pls

05:19:05.520 --> 05:19:06.880
um

05:19:06.880 --> 05:19:10.640
I feel like going forward people be able to talk more freely about them

05:19:11.280 --> 05:19:14.080
Because those connections just don't go away, you know

05:19:15.840 --> 05:19:19.760
Uh, if when you're like very well known people recognize your voice

05:19:20.480 --> 05:19:23.360
You have a lot of friends. It's yeah, it's hard to be like

05:19:24.480 --> 05:19:29.200
Of course like n da's it gives this and you can only you can share so much

05:19:29.360 --> 05:19:32.800
Oh, you can only share so much and that's fine, but I feel like

05:19:34.960 --> 05:19:36.320
That

05:19:36.320 --> 05:19:40.560
That will change and I don't think that's because of us. That's it's already been the in the

05:19:41.360 --> 05:19:44.720
In the works and the v2 being community that taboo kind of

05:19:45.440 --> 05:19:50.880
Not being a thing anymore, but I think like we're one of the first groups to normalize it

05:19:51.680 --> 05:19:53.180
Which is cool

05:19:53.180 --> 05:19:56.880
PLs often have the same save some corporates. Yeah, exactly. Like I know

05:19:57.680 --> 05:20:01.760
Usually like people in the new idol wave are probably gonna be bill

05:20:01.760 --> 05:20:04.960
I already know that we have recently graduated vice versa

05:20:05.840 --> 05:20:08.960
Because you know v2 being community tends to recycle their

05:20:09.600 --> 05:20:12.880
Fucking talents. Um, I think v for morai

05:20:13.760 --> 05:20:18.320
Is one of the more recent ones where there are people that I don't know. I didn't know about before

05:20:20.480 --> 05:20:26.400
Or some but and I'm very thankful for strongy giving us a chance because I know I was a nobody

05:20:27.200 --> 05:20:29.200
Zura was very small

05:20:29.520 --> 05:20:31.520
I see was very small

05:20:32.320 --> 05:20:33.840
uh, so

05:20:33.920 --> 05:20:41.040
And mercy was like a little like medium-sized and um, I mean was larger, but uh, like she

05:20:42.560 --> 05:20:48.880
Gave us a chance and when she did see big names applying. So I appreciated that a bunch

05:20:49.760 --> 05:20:54.000
Um, because I I never thought I was going to break into the industry because

05:20:54.720 --> 05:20:56.720
People were kind of just going through the same

05:20:57.520 --> 05:21:03.120
You know jump and jive of getting the same talents over and over if someone graduates just moves to another company

05:21:04.320 --> 05:21:06.320
And I'm like am I ever

05:21:06.400 --> 05:21:09.600
What is what is going to set me apart?

05:21:10.400 --> 05:21:15.120
And let get me in especially if there's nepotism people just hire their friends. So

05:21:15.840 --> 05:21:17.840
It was it was very I

05:21:17.840 --> 05:21:22.720
After if I didn't get into velar, I probably wasn't gonna apply to any more companies anymore

05:21:23.680 --> 05:21:27.440
Um, I was probably just gonna focus on being indie. So I'm very happy that I'm here

05:21:28.160 --> 05:21:32.960
Mm-hmm cynical. Yeah, but

05:21:36.400 --> 05:21:39.600
Be a bit cynical, but it's like when you see a pattern

05:21:41.360 --> 05:21:44.880
And it's it becomes a habit like what else can you think, you know

05:21:45.680 --> 05:21:48.560
Not that I like fault the people in the industry for that

05:21:48.960 --> 05:21:56.880
It's better to you like you know what you're investing in and you know how somebody acts and they already have a good track record in history

05:21:57.120 --> 05:22:01.200
Why would in experience? Why would you not hire them? Like that's it's to be a stupid

05:22:01.680 --> 05:22:06.160
Businesses and not to why would I take a risk on some random nobody from twitch?

05:22:07.040 --> 05:22:08.000
um

05:22:08.000 --> 05:22:10.800
That doesn't have a lot of content creation under the belt

05:22:11.280 --> 05:22:11.920
um

05:22:11.920 --> 05:22:15.520
Where someone who's an agency for two years recently left like I

05:22:16.080 --> 05:22:19.040
It's an it's a no-brainer. So I don't I don't blame it at all

05:22:19.440 --> 05:22:24.080
But then there's people like strani who want to you know develop talent

05:22:25.040 --> 05:22:31.040
And take chance and she had faith in us and I appreciate her immensely for that immensely

05:22:32.480 --> 05:22:35.920
Did Amy give a lot of I don't know you'd have to ask her that

05:22:39.120 --> 05:22:41.520
Yeah, you'd have to ask her that I I don't know and I

05:22:44.000 --> 05:22:45.760
um

05:22:45.760 --> 05:22:50.400
Yeah, I'll be honest with you. I don't know a lot of the other girls motivations for applying

05:22:51.360 --> 05:22:52.720
um

05:22:52.720 --> 05:22:55.040
My motivation again was I wanted

05:22:57.040 --> 05:22:59.920
It wasn't really for me. I just wanted to support

05:23:00.880 --> 05:23:05.280
Strani and I know I can be a good entertainer and yapper, you know, um

05:23:06.320 --> 05:23:07.600
And

05:23:07.600 --> 05:23:09.520
Yeah, I just I just wanted to support her

05:23:09.520 --> 05:23:15.200
I wanted to make change in the community and I saw her as a force for change and I wanted to support support that

05:23:15.760 --> 05:23:20.400
Um as for the other girl. Yeah, I have no idea what their motivations were for joining

05:23:21.120 --> 05:23:27.440
Maybe they wanted to do more adult content. Maybe they wanted to grow their audience. Maybe they wanted a brand

05:23:28.160 --> 05:23:34.160
Um, maybe they wanted more support. I think yeah, I feel like for some of them. It's probably like support

05:23:34.720 --> 05:23:36.880
um for projects and stuff so

05:23:40.960 --> 05:23:45.680
Glad you're here since detail kind of directed me to be alert. Yeah, it's like a yes detail has been really sweet

05:23:45.680 --> 05:23:49.040
She's given us a bunch of shout outs that collab with her was really cool

05:23:49.920 --> 05:23:51.920
um

05:23:53.760 --> 05:23:58.160
I think I want to be a part of a group that too. Um, I feel I think

05:23:59.920 --> 05:24:00.800
I'm

05:24:00.800 --> 05:24:05.360
I forget somebody one of the girls did mention that like I just wanted to be a part of a group

05:24:06.160 --> 05:24:10.560
And I can't remember who it was, but I know that was definitely a part of somebody's motivation

05:24:11.440 --> 05:24:13.440
um

05:24:13.920 --> 05:24:15.520
Amy, yeah

05:24:15.520 --> 05:24:22.000
She is but like let's not talk about her stuff. Um, just because it's not my place to speak on it

05:24:22.720 --> 05:24:28.640
Um, I'll talk about mine, but I won't talk about the other girls because it's not my place. It's not it's

05:24:29.040 --> 05:24:31.040
I don't have any right to talk about it

05:24:31.520 --> 05:24:34.800
Uh, scrawny knows how to pick them. It seems she does so she has an eye

05:24:35.520 --> 05:24:37.520
for for talent

05:24:37.760 --> 05:24:39.440
Um, yeah

05:24:39.440 --> 05:24:43.440
She beats literally sorrow. I think more important than the size of the proof

05:24:43.440 --> 05:24:47.600
There's a work ethic showing that you the library consistent work is reassuring that it lasts

05:24:48.160 --> 05:24:54.320
Yeah, that's why scrawny was a little bit confused because she's like, how do you know so much and do so much?

05:24:54.480 --> 05:24:57.920
But you've only been around for six months and then I explained to her in my interview

05:24:58.400 --> 05:25:04.480
That I technically was around longer than that and I had more content creation on my belt. I just applied with this

05:25:05.200 --> 05:25:07.200
version of myself, um

05:25:08.160 --> 05:25:11.040
Although again the version before

05:25:11.760 --> 05:25:18.480
My past life was just me and the flesh. So there's no point doesn't make sense to apply as my flesh version

05:25:19.120 --> 05:25:20.320
um

05:25:20.320 --> 05:25:25.920
And I was very deter I in my audition video. I just kind of expressed how

05:25:26.720 --> 05:25:31.760
Determined I was to help in just how much I would be a hard worker. I didn't do some people

05:25:32.640 --> 05:25:38.400
People asked like did you how did you like what sexual thing did you do to get in? I didn't do anything

05:25:39.120 --> 05:25:41.840
remotely naughty besides be like

05:25:42.800 --> 05:25:44.000
like make a

05:25:44.000 --> 05:25:46.000
silly like joke

05:25:47.040 --> 05:25:49.040
I just read I

05:25:49.440 --> 05:25:50.880
um

05:25:50.880 --> 05:25:53.200
I just introduced myself played some clips

05:25:53.920 --> 05:25:59.040
Uh, I read all the characters voice lines and different voices that I do and then

05:25:59.840 --> 05:26:02.400
Because I I I didn't really have a set person

05:26:02.960 --> 05:26:09.200
That I wanted to be in the company. So I trusted strongy to cast me for the right role and I think she did

05:26:09.920 --> 05:26:11.920
um

05:26:11.920 --> 05:26:17.280
It's funny. I kind of knew I would be ropes like I looking at the silhouette

05:26:17.360 --> 05:26:19.360
I was immediately attracted to it

05:26:19.760 --> 05:26:24.960
I thought I was going to be cast as like I see to be honest with you because of my past life, but um

05:26:25.760 --> 05:26:28.720
But I I just fucking knew deep down. It's really weird

05:26:30.160 --> 05:26:35.440
Like for the long stream, she'd be yeah, of course. I mean I said that not sure if she's the only one

05:26:39.200 --> 05:26:43.840
Context I don't know it. Um, yeah talk to him if you want to know 100%

05:26:44.400 --> 05:26:46.400
I don't even really hate cold

05:26:46.880 --> 05:26:49.200
She be jorked it. Yeah, I jorked it

05:26:49.200 --> 05:26:54.720
She has a lollip because I used to be a lolly

05:26:55.840 --> 05:26:57.840
Does he know?

05:26:58.240 --> 05:27:04.560
People think your auditions was poor. Yeah, which makes me laugh because literally I'll tell you what I did in my audition

05:27:05.040 --> 05:27:06.880
I introduced myself

05:27:06.880 --> 05:27:08.560
I played one clip

05:27:08.560 --> 05:27:12.240
I continued to introduce myself. I played another funny clip

05:27:13.200 --> 05:27:16.320
I continued to introduce myself. I played an asmr clip

05:27:17.280 --> 05:27:19.280
Um, that's what they do

05:27:21.120 --> 05:27:23.120
I talked

05:27:23.360 --> 05:27:25.360
I did some voice acting

05:27:26.240 --> 05:27:30.400
And then I told my commitment to be a lure and that was literally it

05:27:32.880 --> 05:27:34.880
That was literally the audition

05:27:36.560 --> 05:27:42.160
No, no, yeah, I didn't do any Mongolian throat singing. I was made I made sure to keep that away. I didn't do any yodeling

05:27:43.120 --> 05:27:46.720
Don't make jokes aside. I think you fit her perfectly. Yeah

05:27:48.320 --> 05:27:56.000
What sassy thing did you do bro joining a corpo even spice seems exactly I was very professional um in my

05:27:57.040 --> 05:28:04.080
Uh audition video and I also was very professional for my interview because I didn't know if I was interviewing

05:28:04.960 --> 05:28:08.240
Um, who I was interviewing for who I was interviewing with

05:28:10.000 --> 05:28:11.840
um

05:28:11.840 --> 05:28:15.760
Because I didn't think it would be strong. I thought it would be just the management management team

05:28:16.080 --> 05:28:22.320
But it was actually just her telling me. Oh, yeah, you were our first choice. You saw you. Here's your model. You made it in

05:28:23.040 --> 05:28:25.040
Sign this nda

05:28:25.120 --> 05:28:27.360
And read the contract and let us know

05:28:28.160 --> 05:28:30.160
You have a week to do it

05:28:30.160 --> 05:28:33.600
Uh, yeah, she gave us a long time to look over the contract if we um

05:28:34.080 --> 05:28:36.080
Tell like a lawyer look at it and stuff

05:28:36.160 --> 05:28:39.280
Um, which was very nice of her. She was very patient. Um

05:28:39.520 --> 05:28:44.160
I don't know if I'm allowed to say that but I just did so I think I think that's fine

05:28:46.160 --> 05:28:51.120
Um, how hard did you would fit it? I would do that was so hard. Um

05:28:52.160 --> 05:28:56.800
You didn't split and no, I didn't spit in sharny's mouth. Um, but yeah, it was one interview

05:28:57.600 --> 05:29:02.080
Uh, they're always reviewed contracts. Yeah, exactly. Um

05:29:04.480 --> 05:29:06.480
Yeah, it was just one interview

05:29:06.880 --> 05:29:09.680
She was really nice. I had prepared like a whole thing

05:29:11.040 --> 05:29:13.680
Like questions to ask how to respond

05:29:14.800 --> 05:29:15.840
um

05:29:15.840 --> 05:29:17.600
Very professional

05:29:17.600 --> 05:29:22.880
I even like dressed up did my makeup in case she wanted to do like a video call and then

05:29:23.600 --> 05:29:26.320
I realized yeah, it was just a normal way to go. Um

05:29:27.680 --> 05:29:29.680
But yeah

05:29:30.400 --> 05:29:32.400
How was the couch

05:29:32.400 --> 05:29:37.680
Always a good sign when your player encourages you to fully examine your contract. Oh, yeah, she was very like, please look at it

05:29:37.760 --> 05:29:43.040
Like please make sure this is what you want. Um, I read it over multiple times

05:29:44.640 --> 05:29:46.160
it

05:29:46.160 --> 05:29:49.920
She all says that her and a lawyer did a good job writing something up

05:29:50.960 --> 05:29:56.000
I'm not allowed to say that I've read I had time to read my I don't know. I don't know if this shit works

05:29:58.320 --> 05:30:00.320
You know hard it is for me to keep secrets

05:30:01.040 --> 05:30:05.840
That's why I'm like, if any of you guys have any surprises, don't fucking tell me because we'll tell everyone

05:30:05.840 --> 05:30:11.040
You know how hard it was just not say that I was she be it was so hard for me

05:30:11.440 --> 05:30:16.320
I was dying. I changed the password on my account to my twitter

05:30:18.880 --> 05:30:21.600
I had my friend change it and not tell me

05:30:22.800 --> 05:30:27.760
So I couldn't get back in so I could so I wouldn't fucking accidentally sub tweet something

05:30:28.400 --> 05:30:30.400
Or like something

05:30:33.280 --> 05:30:36.960
Because I was so happy and when you're so happy you want to share it with people that you love

05:30:37.040 --> 05:30:41.200
And so I wanted to share it with my community because I love my community and I knew they would be happy for me

05:30:42.720 --> 05:30:44.720
Oh, yeah

05:30:45.920 --> 05:30:47.920
It's that bad, huh?

05:30:52.800 --> 05:30:57.120
I'm getting eepy 10 30 I should probably go to bed

05:30:58.480 --> 05:31:00.480
Need to make some tea

05:31:01.520 --> 05:31:05.440
Um, but should you be in spoilers domo?

05:31:06.800 --> 05:31:09.840
Honestly though, that's that's that's me. That's why I

05:31:10.960 --> 05:31:15.920
Like I already know a bit about gen 2 and it's very hard not to talk about it

05:31:18.400 --> 05:31:22.400
But um before I go to bed, did you guys have any more questions for me?

05:31:23.040 --> 05:31:25.200
I don't mind answering any questions you guys have

05:31:25.760 --> 05:31:28.560
You guys know I'm a very open book and I love to yeah

05:31:29.200 --> 05:31:33.600
And barely play games. I am a just chatting streamer. I have to fart

05:31:35.600 --> 05:31:38.480
I don't know if you heard that whisper of a fart. I really hope you didn't

05:31:40.720 --> 05:31:42.720
No spoilers for gen 2

05:31:44.400 --> 05:31:48.160
You mean how strong he hasn't even said that gen 2 is in the works

05:31:49.920 --> 05:31:51.920
Yes, she has

05:31:52.880 --> 05:31:55.520
She definitely said the gen 2 is in the works

05:31:59.920 --> 05:32:01.920
Huh, can you pronounce?

05:32:11.680 --> 05:32:16.480
Yeah, I'm starting to can't stop talking about gen 2. She's so excited. Yeah, she's talking about fucking gen 3

05:32:16.480 --> 05:32:21.600
It's talking about gen 3

05:32:24.080 --> 05:32:26.080
Um

05:32:26.080 --> 05:32:28.080
I had to be like can you stop

05:32:28.160 --> 05:32:34.160
I'm like strani. You're making me feel bad. I'm like you're already conceptualizing gen 2 and 3. What about me?

05:32:34.320 --> 05:32:38.320
She's like, no, no, no, no, I don't want you to feel bad. And I'm like, no, I'm kidding. I'm excited

05:32:38.640 --> 05:32:44.160
Can I please help? And she's like, yes, I'm like, thank you slam girl. I was shot down, but it's fine

05:32:47.440 --> 05:32:50.240
Okay, wait, how do you pronounce it then?

05:32:52.080 --> 05:32:54.080
How do you pronounce it?

05:32:57.520 --> 05:33:04.000
Yeah, I think me and strani are so like it's kind of weird. She's just in a Scottish font

05:33:05.920 --> 05:33:10.480
She says she is gen 2 and gen 3 in games names for them. Yeah, exactly

05:33:11.360 --> 05:33:15.120
I'm I'm gonna try to talk her down from some of the names. That's all I'm gonna say

05:33:15.120 --> 05:33:17.120
I can't read

05:33:17.760 --> 05:33:19.760
I can't read

05:33:20.080 --> 05:33:22.480
Leave me alone. I don't speak French that well

05:33:24.400 --> 05:33:26.400
I mean squarel

05:33:26.880 --> 05:33:30.800
I can't read I can't I can't I can't

05:33:32.240 --> 05:33:34.400
Should give you some towns

05:33:36.640 --> 05:33:38.640
In my area to pronounce

05:33:38.640 --> 05:33:45.680
Talks about Jennifer with slides will be destroyed

05:33:47.440 --> 05:33:51.040
Pretty sure she has rescued herself from naming future gents. Yeah

05:33:53.040 --> 05:33:56.720
The reason it's a slime girl is because she's thinking of the name of a slimy slime hole

05:34:01.760 --> 05:34:03.760
One of them accidentally docks you wait what?

05:34:05.840 --> 05:34:07.840
Oh like that. No, um

05:34:09.200 --> 05:34:11.200
So like

05:34:12.560 --> 05:34:14.560
I'm not

05:34:14.640 --> 05:34:18.080
Afraid to say like I live in America on the east coast

05:34:18.880 --> 05:34:21.680
There's a lot of how hard to pronounce

05:34:23.360 --> 05:34:25.360
Like towns and cities

05:34:25.920 --> 05:34:28.240
Like all around along the east coast

05:34:29.440 --> 05:34:32.160
So like especially in fucking New England

05:34:32.240 --> 05:34:34.240
I

05:34:34.720 --> 05:34:39.280
Guys don't fuck with fondle of bosom. I actually really want to bring back fondle of bosom

05:34:40.080 --> 05:34:42.480
And she could be like a really touchy feely person

05:34:44.080 --> 05:34:46.640
Games is a video game. She got the concept for oh, okay

05:34:48.480 --> 05:34:52.160
In death a member of project wheeler has a name her name is fondle

05:34:53.840 --> 05:34:55.840
Of the liberty city. Yeah

05:35:03.120 --> 05:35:08.240
You look nice when you're just laying in bed instead of walking and stomping all over my booze

05:35:09.520 --> 05:35:14.400
East coast represent somebody said they knew I was east coast because I talk so bluntly

05:35:15.440 --> 05:35:18.080
And that I have an accent and I never fucking noticed that

05:35:19.200 --> 05:35:21.200
Come on beat that. Please come back

05:35:21.520 --> 05:35:23.520
You can just say come on beat it

05:35:24.080 --> 05:35:26.080
beat

05:35:26.800 --> 05:35:32.080
They're like she's I just like I've never been clocked on where I like where I'm from

05:35:32.240 --> 05:35:33.360
before

05:35:33.360 --> 05:35:35.360
And I didn't know that being blunt

05:35:36.640 --> 05:35:40.000
Was a thing like they knew where I was from and I was like

05:35:41.040 --> 05:35:43.040
Damn

05:35:43.280 --> 05:35:45.280
I did not think that I also

05:35:46.320 --> 05:35:51.200
I well, yeah, I use eastern. Yeah, that's fine. Um, and I also I talk fast

05:35:52.240 --> 05:35:57.200
Because I know people from the south talk slower. Remember when I visited my grandparents in florida

05:35:57.600 --> 05:35:59.360
um

05:35:59.360 --> 05:36:03.680
They would like people I would talk to you that were that was like can you speed the fuck up?

05:36:04.800 --> 05:36:06.800
Because you're talking

05:36:07.280 --> 05:36:10.560
Like this. Oh my god was so fucking annoying

05:36:12.480 --> 05:36:16.480
When you said you visited Montreal, that's more evident around the east coast. That's a good point

05:36:17.280 --> 05:36:22.160
East coast is kind but not nice. Oh, yeah. No east coasts. We're fucking dicks

05:36:23.680 --> 05:36:26.720
Especially massachusetts. That's why they call them mass holes

05:36:27.760 --> 05:36:29.760
I always thought that was funny. They call them that

05:36:31.440 --> 05:36:36.720
Yeah, new england people are cold, especially a lot of people are chill. Yeah. Yeah, a lot of people are chill

05:36:38.160 --> 05:36:40.160
medicaid people are fucking uppity

05:36:41.040 --> 05:36:42.640
try thing

05:36:42.640 --> 05:36:44.640
North Carolina, georgia

05:36:45.440 --> 05:36:47.440
They're kind of nice

05:36:47.440 --> 05:36:49.440
carolinas are nice

05:36:50.800 --> 05:36:55.520
Strings them and how much information is conveyed per second by different languages and accents, right? Yeah

05:36:55.760 --> 05:36:58.260
Because you can literally like especially if you're in like the uk

05:36:59.520 --> 05:37:01.520
You can clock someone's accent

05:37:02.400 --> 05:37:04.400
Because they're all accents are by region

05:37:06.400 --> 05:37:08.400
Like i'm sure you could probably look at a british

05:37:08.800 --> 05:37:14.400
Vtuber and I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of british vtubers change their accents so that they don't

05:37:15.760 --> 05:37:17.760
You don't know where they're from

05:37:18.960 --> 05:37:20.960
The latel fiends are in our own special

05:37:25.600 --> 05:37:28.400
We have to be chillin florida or else we'd melt

05:37:29.200 --> 05:37:30.800
true

05:37:30.800 --> 05:37:35.280
Got the opposite. It's not yin and yin only other field filipino side was british or something

05:37:35.840 --> 05:37:37.840
No, i'm pretty sure i have american accent

05:37:38.400 --> 05:37:40.400
yeah, i've got

05:37:41.760 --> 05:37:45.520
Like i do have like i'll have an accent sometimes that slips out

05:37:46.400 --> 05:37:50.240
And i don't know if a lot of people have like heard it slip out

05:37:51.120 --> 05:37:53.120
Like obviously i'm from america

05:37:53.440 --> 05:37:56.480
And east coast but i like sometimes when i get super excited

05:37:57.280 --> 05:37:59.280
um

05:37:59.520 --> 05:38:04.000
My or like frustrated or i just like really tired and my words slur together

05:38:04.480 --> 05:38:06.320
um, i start to have

05:38:06.320 --> 05:38:08.320
My accent comes out

05:38:08.560 --> 05:38:10.000
but uh

05:38:10.000 --> 05:38:12.000
Miss origan tipped 50 dollars

05:38:12.400 --> 05:38:18.080
You're the first vtuber i've ever watched and you quickly become probably my favorite content creator period

05:38:18.880 --> 05:38:21.200
Also could as three percent get get some donnie

05:38:30.400 --> 05:38:33.840
Such good girls, thank you

05:38:35.760 --> 05:38:37.760
Best girl

05:38:39.200 --> 05:38:44.480
And they say hello, so yeah, no i'm that type of person like i'll like i'm also really bad with eye contact

05:38:44.720 --> 05:38:48.560
um, i've always been bad with eye contact even in working in sales and

05:38:49.040 --> 05:38:54.080
Being a lot more confident than it used to be. I just don't like looking at people. I don't know what the fucking tell you

05:38:54.480 --> 05:38:56.480
i'm squirt

05:38:58.080 --> 05:39:00.080
No, i'm kidding. Um, no, where am i?

05:39:03.760 --> 05:39:07.600
And so i'll usually just like look down and smile

05:39:08.240 --> 05:39:12.480
Um, but lately i've been trying to say hello to people

05:39:14.960 --> 05:39:16.960
um

05:39:18.640 --> 05:39:20.640
Um

05:39:21.520 --> 05:39:26.320
Although like i remember going to the south and people are like too nice and i'm like stop talking to me

05:39:26.320 --> 05:39:29.280
Like why are you striking up a conversation with me? I was at a wawa

05:39:29.600 --> 05:39:34.240
I'm like and this guy like is like i'm getting coffee and i'm one of like the little station

05:39:34.320 --> 05:39:37.360
And then this guy comes and starts talking to me and i'm like, uh

05:39:38.640 --> 05:39:40.640
Why are you talking to me like you don't

05:39:41.440 --> 05:39:45.120
You don't have to talk to me right now. Like can you please go away?

05:39:56.560 --> 05:39:59.920
But like i've also adapted a skill that i've seen my dad do

05:40:00.640 --> 05:40:04.640
Um, my dad has a special skill where he can be friends with about anyone

05:40:06.800 --> 05:40:10.400
Uh, he finds common ground. He makes a joke

05:40:11.600 --> 05:40:15.280
And then miraculously he just becomes friends with this person and then

05:40:16.000 --> 05:40:19.120
He i might say becomes friends with everybody. I'm not even fucking joking

05:40:19.440 --> 05:40:23.440
He'll talk he'll like catch a snippet of a conversation that someone's having on the street

05:40:23.680 --> 05:40:26.720
Make a joke and then make the person laugh and then they're just friends

05:40:27.360 --> 05:40:34.320
He like i forget what the fuck he did. So my dad really likes to drink bourbon. Um, he likes uh, he's a collector

05:40:34.880 --> 05:40:35.920
um

05:40:35.920 --> 05:40:41.360
And like if you go to my parents house, they look they're a bunch of fucking alcoholics because they just have a shit ton of bourbon

05:40:41.680 --> 05:40:44.560
In this one side of the room, but it's it's it's not even like that

05:40:44.560 --> 05:40:48.880
My dad just likes to collect and like have it not even drink it. Um

05:40:50.320 --> 05:40:52.800
And so he goes to like this place

05:40:53.360 --> 05:40:56.560
Strikes up a conversation just being really friendly and getting to know

05:40:57.040 --> 05:40:59.040
They're like cracking jokes with the cashier

05:40:59.680 --> 05:41:00.720
and then

05:41:00.720 --> 05:41:02.720
Over the course of a couple weeks

05:41:02.960 --> 05:41:07.760
He becomes like boys with the cashier and then the cashier hooks him up with like

05:41:08.080 --> 05:41:11.120
Really like and like calls him ahead when they get in like good stuff

05:41:11.440 --> 05:41:16.880
And i'm like what the fuck and i'm like, oh wait, it just pays to be nice to people because then they're nice back

05:41:18.640 --> 05:41:20.480
So um

05:41:20.480 --> 05:41:26.720
And then like i'm like, you know, so i'm trying to be more like my dad in that way and just be nice to people

05:41:30.800 --> 05:41:32.800
Just fucking

05:41:33.200 --> 05:41:35.200
It's cat hair in my mouth

05:41:35.440 --> 05:41:37.280
um

05:41:37.280 --> 05:41:39.440
And it's it's very like i think

05:41:41.280 --> 05:41:45.920
There there's this um little girl in my building and i don't know why she likes me so much

05:41:46.560 --> 05:41:54.160
Um, i think because i look like i should be like her sister or something. She's like this really cute um Spanish girl with curly hair

05:41:54.960 --> 05:41:56.560
and

05:41:56.560 --> 05:41:58.960
She saw me in the elevator one day

05:41:59.680 --> 05:42:02.880
And she was wearing a bathing suit

05:42:03.600 --> 05:42:08.400
And i'm just sitting there and like kids are great because they just like talk to you for no reason

05:42:08.640 --> 05:42:10.640
and they just just because they just don't know like

05:42:12.000 --> 05:42:16.880
Like social cues and i'm like just i literally look like a shit. I'm like in shorts

05:42:17.520 --> 05:42:21.440
A sweatshirt a hood's up. I'm like i look like i'm fucking pathetic

05:42:22.240 --> 05:42:23.840
homeless girl

05:42:23.840 --> 05:42:25.680
my face is like

05:42:25.680 --> 05:42:28.560
Messy and this little girl looks up at me and she's like

05:42:29.360 --> 05:42:31.600
Do you like my unicorn bathing suit?

05:42:32.080 --> 05:42:34.080
And i look at her and i'm like

05:42:34.160 --> 05:42:35.360
And i

05:42:35.360 --> 05:42:39.520
And i'm like, oh my god. Yes, it's so great. She's like see mom. She likes it

05:42:40.320 --> 05:42:42.320
And then every time i see her

05:42:42.720 --> 05:42:44.720
She always makes sure she says hi to me

05:42:45.680 --> 05:42:47.920
and she's like and then um

05:42:48.880 --> 05:42:54.080
She like ran over to me one day when i was in the lobby of the apartment building and her mom's like

05:42:54.640 --> 05:42:58.880
Redacted come back and she's like i'm saying hi to my friend mom and i'm just like

05:42:59.840 --> 05:43:02.320
And so i'm like, you know what i strive to be this child

05:43:03.920 --> 05:43:06.720
That's really cute. It was really fucking cute. Um

05:43:07.920 --> 05:43:14.000
She was really sweet. She's like i like the like the natural cuteness and curiosity of kids. This is so funny to me

05:43:14.480 --> 05:43:17.520
Uh, and then like it happened again with like another kid

05:43:18.160 --> 05:43:22.000
Uh, and i'm like, do i just have that like that face where like do you kid?

05:43:22.000 --> 05:43:25.360
I'm like, i don't know if the kid's pity me or they're like, uh, you know what? I want to talk to her

05:43:25.840 --> 05:43:30.800
I like i'm i'm going to pick up my door dash. I think it was like yesterday or the day before

05:43:31.200 --> 05:43:32.880
No, it was definitely yesterday

05:43:32.880 --> 05:43:38.080
And i get into the elevator and now it's super hot outside and we have a pool in my apartment and so people um

05:43:38.880 --> 05:43:40.880
Like we're leaving to go to the pool. There's like four kids

05:43:41.360 --> 05:43:47.520
Piling the elevator with their mom and then one of the the girls just starts talking to me and i'm just like

05:43:48.480 --> 05:43:54.480
She's like, hey, it's really hot outside. Isn't it? We're going to the pool. I'm like, oh, wow. I hope you guys have a lot of fun

05:43:56.640 --> 05:44:02.400
And they're like, okay. Bye as we get to the first floor and I go to go pick up my my uh my food

05:44:02.880 --> 05:44:06.240
But it's just it was just it's this is sweet. It was just really sweet

05:44:07.600 --> 05:44:12.240
Congratulations, you're a best friend now and it's like I've always been good with kids

05:44:12.400 --> 05:44:16.480
I don't know why like I used to work at like a sermon camp. I used to be like a camp counselor and stuff

05:44:16.960 --> 05:44:18.960
and um, I remember

05:44:19.200 --> 05:44:21.440
There was this time where um

05:44:21.440 --> 05:44:27.120
These girls were like arguing because they wanted me to like I was a better artist than I am now

05:44:27.680 --> 05:44:28.240
um

05:44:28.240 --> 05:44:31.520
Because I kept up with it and they're like, can you draw our monster high dolls?

05:44:31.520 --> 05:44:37.040
So I would draw their monster high dolls and they would fight over whose doll gets to be drawn. It was so cute

05:44:37.680 --> 05:44:39.680
um

05:44:40.800 --> 05:44:45.120
I could smile with an awesomer expression in my private video the other day how they were like, oh, that's cute

05:44:45.120 --> 05:44:47.120
It was like

05:44:48.160 --> 05:44:50.160
What the fuck did I miss something?

05:44:56.000 --> 05:45:01.200
If you think you look at that, oh, no, if you guys saw me be like, who is this little stinky rat girl

05:45:02.320 --> 05:45:04.320
I looked like I was going to rob someone

05:45:06.000 --> 05:45:10.640
Wawa you narrowed that down a bit. Well, it was a wawa because there's no wawa's in our area

05:45:11.920 --> 05:45:13.920
Right from they don't we don't have wawa

05:45:16.000 --> 05:45:18.000
So

05:45:25.680 --> 05:45:30.000
It's like the little the little innocence of kids like they don't need like they're not rude

05:45:30.080 --> 05:45:33.280
There's no malice behind what they say like they're just generally

05:45:34.400 --> 05:45:37.760
Just talking to you like and it's just it's refreshing

05:45:38.480 --> 05:45:40.480
But

05:45:43.680 --> 05:45:47.280
Yeah, it's just like I want to be more like that like just be like hey

05:45:48.640 --> 05:45:52.640
And that's why like that's what I'm gonna try to do in the v2 breed thing like community and shit

05:45:52.880 --> 05:45:54.880
That's why like I'm trying to

05:45:55.280 --> 05:45:59.840
Like be like hey, I'll do this thing with you or I'll do this collab or I'll do that

05:46:08.080 --> 05:46:11.680
And it adopted me. Yeah, maybe I guess so

05:46:12.480 --> 05:46:14.640
um

05:46:14.640 --> 05:46:18.960
Oh, yeah, that's not what morgan said reminds me. Uh, I remember I went to like

05:46:19.920 --> 05:46:21.120
uh

05:46:21.120 --> 05:46:23.120
An event where I dressed up

05:46:24.320 --> 05:46:26.320
Yeah, as in like a cosplay

05:46:26.880 --> 05:46:27.920
um

05:46:27.920 --> 05:46:32.800
And this little girl asked to take a picture with me and I literally wanted to cry and like other people wanted to take pictures with me

05:46:32.800 --> 05:46:34.400
And I was just like, oh my god

05:46:34.480 --> 05:46:38.000
Like they think I'm gonna I look cool enough to ask for a picture

05:46:39.040 --> 05:46:41.040
And I was like, okay

05:46:42.240 --> 05:46:44.240
It was it was it's nice

05:46:48.160 --> 05:46:54.720
I know rena rena's looking at me like why aren't you in bed yet? She'd be piqued. Yeah, it's only downhill for me or guys

05:46:56.720 --> 05:46:59.120
She'd be cool. I try to be cool

05:46:59.120 --> 05:47:01.120
I

05:47:02.000 --> 05:47:04.000
See me I try to be cool

05:47:04.000 --> 05:47:06.880
I think I'm a cool cat cool rabbit, you know

05:47:08.080 --> 05:47:10.720
I'm cool. Yeah, I can be cool. I can be hip with the kids, you know

05:47:11.680 --> 05:47:15.760
I know about fortnight and um fortnight dances and v-wux and all that

05:47:22.400 --> 05:47:24.560
Cool rabbit sheep. Yeah, exactly

05:47:25.040 --> 05:47:30.160
Kids don't have souls. Oh, yeah, no, there's definitely some like kids that are like really fucking shitty out there

05:47:30.800 --> 05:47:34.000
Like I don't want kids, for example. I like I don't want kids

05:47:35.200 --> 05:47:41.760
One because I don't know if I didn't have kids because I don't know if I have falls less than over a century or not, but um

05:47:43.120 --> 05:47:47.600
I also just like it's a lot to raise a whole ass child. Like I don't want to

05:47:48.240 --> 05:47:50.720
Traumatize them and make them hate me

05:47:51.680 --> 05:47:56.720
I know what I put my parents through so I don't want to put my child through that with me

05:47:58.640 --> 05:48:01.120
Um, you know fucking children are expensive

05:48:02.240 --> 05:48:05.840
That means like I'm 56. Where am I gonna find a dude?

05:48:06.960 --> 05:48:08.960
Who wants to have kids with me?

05:48:09.760 --> 05:48:14.240
I'm like, I don't I just don't fucking care. I just like having cats

05:48:14.960 --> 05:48:16.160
I

05:48:16.160 --> 05:48:21.600
Was at a con for some reason. There's a couple of people that cosplay that didn't want their photo taken. Oh, yeah

05:48:22.480 --> 05:48:26.720
Sometimes you just go just to dress up and have fun. I got it. They just want to take pictures with their friends

05:48:27.600 --> 05:48:28.880
right here

05:48:28.880 --> 05:48:30.880
To be too boy, no show would be dope

05:48:32.720 --> 05:48:35.200
I find you have a sort of effless cool with how Jenny when you are

05:48:36.240 --> 05:48:37.920
you know, uh

05:48:37.920 --> 05:48:41.920
I feel like that's actually not the first time someone said that to me not to toot my own horn

05:48:42.720 --> 05:48:47.760
Um, people have always said I'm just really easy to talk to and that's why people tend to like

05:48:48.400 --> 05:48:50.400
Accidentally overshare with me

05:48:51.600 --> 05:48:55.280
Uh, uh, I'll just be like, hey, how are you feeling? They'd be like, um, you know

05:48:55.680 --> 05:49:00.000
Try to make small talk and then I'm not the type of person who I just like walk away and be like, okay

05:49:00.240 --> 05:49:05.280
Thanks for checking in. Um, I'll like like elaborate with my question. Raina. What the fuck are you doing?

05:49:06.080 --> 05:49:08.960
She's rubbing against my monitor lady. Can you?

05:49:09.840 --> 05:49:10.960
No

05:49:10.960 --> 05:49:12.400
ma'am

05:49:12.400 --> 05:49:13.920
I can't stop you

05:49:13.920 --> 05:49:15.920
I'm too tired to reach over

05:49:16.400 --> 05:49:18.720
It's your little twitchy, but what are you doing?

05:49:20.000 --> 05:49:22.000
Hi, Raina

05:49:24.800 --> 05:49:30.240
Raina's like lost weight and she looks so goofy. I mean she used to be super fucking overweight. She was like 17

05:49:30.880 --> 05:49:32.880
Almost 20 pounds. Um

05:49:33.760 --> 05:49:35.760
But she lost a lot of weight

05:49:36.640 --> 05:49:42.480
Sadly because she went through a little depressing episode when her sister passed away, which I don't blame her and when I moved into my apartment

05:49:42.480 --> 05:49:44.480
I took her with me. Um

05:49:45.520 --> 05:49:47.680
Yeah, Raina, she's a little meow

05:49:48.480 --> 05:49:49.840
um

05:49:49.840 --> 05:49:53.680
So she's she's got a healthy weight now, but I miss her her chunky size

05:49:54.960 --> 05:49:56.960
Oh you purring big mamas

05:49:57.920 --> 05:50:01.920
Oh, yeah, she was she was a chonker because Siamese cats tend to overeat

05:50:02.720 --> 05:50:06.480
She's my life stories, ma'am

05:50:09.120 --> 05:50:12.560
Do you think your openness is a good thing or has it caused you unwanted problems?

05:50:13.280 --> 05:50:14.560
um

05:50:14.560 --> 05:50:17.920
I think some people probably wish that I was a little bit more

05:50:18.720 --> 05:50:21.920
left things to the imagination or like didn't share

05:50:23.280 --> 05:50:26.880
Like I know sometimes things I'll share something like I bet

05:50:27.520 --> 05:50:29.520
someone has like

05:50:29.840 --> 05:50:32.960
Like I said like I want a reduction and they're like, oh, why the

05:50:33.520 --> 05:50:39.120
Ruin filtered. Why did she have to say that? Oh, no, but like I'm just telling you

05:50:40.560 --> 05:50:42.560
You know just because I want to tell you

05:50:43.920 --> 05:50:45.920
And like that's fine. That's okay

05:50:46.960 --> 05:50:48.480
um

05:50:48.480 --> 05:50:52.160
It is what it is or like I might say something like oh, I'm not gonna do this content

05:50:53.200 --> 05:50:56.480
Like oh, why would you say that? Oh because I'm gonna be honest

05:50:56.480 --> 05:50:59.440
Do you want to just be strung along and let on? No, like

05:51:00.240 --> 05:51:04.720
If you want me to lead you on I'll lead you on I suppose sorry rena's are being against my microphone

05:51:05.440 --> 05:51:07.440
um

05:51:07.760 --> 05:51:09.760
I'm like this. I'm just how I am

05:51:12.000 --> 05:51:16.000
Buenos dias shippies me fun time freddy. So what did I miss?

05:51:17.360 --> 05:51:19.360
Buenos dias freddy

05:51:20.800 --> 05:51:24.080
Well, buenas noche. It's night time for me freddy

05:51:25.040 --> 05:51:27.040
It's night time for me

05:51:30.800 --> 05:51:32.080
um

05:51:32.080 --> 05:51:34.080
but I think people also

05:51:35.040 --> 05:51:42.960
Are refreshed by my openness as a vtuber because vtubers usually constantly play as something or pretend to be someone or not or

05:51:44.400 --> 05:51:48.640
And I think I I like how real I am. So I I think I'm refreshing in that

05:51:49.440 --> 05:51:53.920
You know it if you don't like it, I can't stop you from not watching

05:51:54.480 --> 05:51:56.480
I'm gonna fucking glue your eyes to the screen

05:51:59.040 --> 05:52:01.440
You want to be led in a leash not in false sense

05:52:05.760 --> 05:52:08.640
She won't make submissive crying a some more it's over

05:52:08.960 --> 05:52:10.960
I

05:52:14.000 --> 05:52:20.960
Realness of this whole company is refreshing. Yes, I agree with that because I feel like we're all very real

05:52:21.360 --> 05:52:23.360
Like we're all very open

05:52:23.760 --> 05:52:28.240
Which you don't get and I know that actually can put a lot of people off because you know

05:52:28.800 --> 05:52:31.840
First some it might ruin the fantasy

05:52:32.640 --> 05:52:35.520
And I understand that I can't disagree with you

05:52:36.240 --> 05:52:38.000
um

05:52:38.000 --> 05:52:40.320
But for some it kind of like makes it better. I don't know

05:52:41.680 --> 05:52:46.240
Most of us appreciate it. It might be small, little minority who complain. Yeah

05:52:47.040 --> 05:52:49.040
Yeah

05:52:49.760 --> 05:52:51.760
um

05:52:51.840 --> 05:52:56.160
And I do you want to say like who who complain their opinions are still valid. Um

05:52:57.520 --> 05:53:01.200
I don't want you to ever think just because like we might disagree on something that

05:53:02.240 --> 05:53:04.960
I fucking hate you. It's really hard for me to hate people

05:53:05.920 --> 05:53:07.920
uh

05:53:08.080 --> 05:53:10.080
Definitely open on the else

05:53:11.200 --> 05:53:18.160
Open this asshole. Um rena. Can I please move you? She's like just sitting on me and I'm like uncomfortable

05:53:18.640 --> 05:53:22.720
She's just you're not in a good position to sit on me lady

05:53:24.320 --> 05:53:27.360
Thank you. I appreciate it. She's moved to the bed

05:53:29.200 --> 05:53:31.200
um

05:53:32.000 --> 05:53:34.000
I miss her and I thought you said Europeans

05:53:34.720 --> 05:53:36.720
are still valid

05:53:37.280 --> 05:53:39.280
your opinions

05:53:40.000 --> 05:53:42.000
Europeans are still valid

05:53:44.640 --> 05:53:46.640
um, but

05:53:54.000 --> 05:53:58.960
They're not valid. Oh, no, okay. Um, like you're

05:53:59.920 --> 05:54:03.280
You're still allowed to dislike me

05:54:04.320 --> 05:54:09.840
I'll like the content or do how I talk or what I might do in the future or what the other girls do

05:54:10.480 --> 05:54:13.440
um, but you just don't have to make it a habit to

05:54:14.400 --> 05:54:16.400
Try to drag us, you know

05:54:16.560 --> 05:54:18.560
You can just leave

05:54:18.800 --> 05:54:21.280
Just shut your eyes and walk away from the computer, bro

05:54:23.040 --> 05:54:25.520
Or just like look up that one Tyler the creator tweet

05:54:29.760 --> 05:54:34.800
Hey, European people in chat. You're valid. I think they're all asleep right now. It's very late for them

05:54:37.440 --> 05:54:41.120
Maybe I don't know what time is it for the our European friends

05:54:43.200 --> 05:54:46.720
I'm probably gonna as mercy streaming today. I'll probably read into her

05:54:47.520 --> 05:54:50.560
If you want fantasy, you probably have to find specific vtubers that do that

05:54:50.560 --> 05:54:54.720
Some people just use models because they want to be secretive or have to set up stuff. That's true

05:54:55.520 --> 05:54:57.280
I think

05:54:57.280 --> 05:54:58.880
you know

05:54:59.840 --> 05:55:01.840
I

05:55:03.760 --> 05:55:06.000
I was totally prepared to like

05:55:06.720 --> 05:55:08.720
play a character

05:55:09.120 --> 05:55:11.120
Being in v alert an agency

05:55:11.680 --> 05:55:17.520
But I think to be honest because of my audience and because of management and astronomy

05:55:18.480 --> 05:55:23.520
I feel comfortable being myself. I think if I got into like a different company

05:55:23.680 --> 05:55:26.080
I could be like say so I could be

05:55:26.960 --> 05:55:28.960
You know play the character

05:55:29.440 --> 05:55:33.280
Um, I did definitely kind of play a character when I was ran up

05:55:33.680 --> 05:55:35.440
But I really do

05:55:35.440 --> 05:55:37.520
Feel and I'm kind of just realizing this now that

05:55:38.400 --> 05:55:40.400
I'm very much myself

05:55:40.800 --> 05:55:42.080
As she be

05:55:42.080 --> 05:55:44.080
It's very interesting

05:55:44.720 --> 05:55:46.720
Is there is life? Oh, okay

05:55:46.880 --> 05:55:49.120
Or maybe I can just like raid someone random

05:55:50.080 --> 05:55:53.520
Make, you know, I've got to make those friendships those connections raid someone from

05:55:54.240 --> 05:55:56.240
A different different company

05:55:57.600 --> 05:56:00.560
In characters with the patreon audios are for yeah, exactly

05:56:01.040 --> 05:56:05.360
Um, and then sometimes, you know, there's different roles that I play in the patreon audios

05:56:05.680 --> 05:56:06.560
but

05:56:06.560 --> 05:56:09.200
I hope you guys liked it by the way. Um, again, that was

05:56:09.680 --> 05:56:14.640
This month is the first month that I recorded back in april and I've definitely learned a lot since then

05:56:14.960 --> 05:56:15.840
so

05:56:15.840 --> 05:56:22.160
I feel I feel like because I've recorded three months of audios in advance. Uh, I recorded june july and august

05:56:22.720 --> 05:56:27.760
Uh, I I was gonna start september. I haven't done that yet. I'll probably do it soon. Um,

05:56:28.400 --> 05:56:32.080
But the september audios will probably be a lot

05:56:33.040 --> 05:56:36.880
Different than like because just because like the feedback I've gotten

05:56:37.600 --> 05:56:39.840
Um, the advice I've gotten

05:56:40.800 --> 05:56:46.000
So I feel like there'll be improvements like at least september on

05:56:46.720 --> 05:56:48.400
uh, and then

05:56:48.400 --> 05:56:53.440
You guys have also given feedback to like strani and stuff about like the scripts you want us to fill

05:56:54.000 --> 05:56:58.000
Come and that's why like strani wants like, oh, we need to make a whole month of you

05:56:58.000 --> 05:57:01.920
Just like straight dom like hardcore and I'm like facts. Please. Let's do it

05:57:02.320 --> 05:57:05.680
That's what we give the people what they want. Give them the dom that they ask for

05:57:06.480 --> 05:57:08.480
um, but yeah

05:57:08.640 --> 05:57:11.520
Okay, oh, yeah, no, it's I've paced myself for that

05:57:12.240 --> 05:57:14.240
um

05:57:14.240 --> 05:57:15.440
I also

05:57:15.440 --> 05:57:21.920
I have a lot of free time. Um, when I was out of work on leave and now since I'm just I've quit entirely

05:57:22.560 --> 05:57:24.240
um

05:57:24.240 --> 05:57:28.240
I so I just cranked them out. The other girls had a lot of other obligations

05:57:28.240 --> 05:57:31.440
They had to do so like I finished a lot of my shit in the first month

05:57:32.800 --> 05:57:35.600
Like I and then I was like, please strani throw most rough at me

05:57:35.600 --> 05:57:40.080
So should you just get thrown scripts at me? Um and shorts at me to do

05:57:40.720 --> 05:57:43.040
But yeah, don't worry about me. I don't

05:57:43.920 --> 05:57:45.920
Me and strani

05:57:46.880 --> 05:57:52.320
Like I attain to be as hard working as strani is she is the hard-working working autism

05:57:52.400 --> 05:57:54.800
I don't have autism that I fucking know of

05:57:55.120 --> 05:58:00.000
Um, but I am definitely inspired by her work ethic to work as much as I do

05:58:01.840 --> 05:58:04.160
M's and the switches are eating good on them of facts

05:58:04.720 --> 05:58:09.920
Yeah, like listening to them patriot, but I still need to listen to the second one more to finalize my feedback. Okay

05:58:10.720 --> 05:58:15.440
I feel like I don't know why I just got the equivalent of like someone sipping wine be like

05:58:17.440 --> 05:58:20.160
I need to finalize my feedback for this flavor

05:58:23.840 --> 05:58:28.320
But yeah, I hope if you're going to sleep good night, um, I'm gonna raid someone

05:58:28.720 --> 05:58:34.720
Let's see. Maybe we'll yeah, maybe we'll raid someone new. I don't know if anybody's streaming us late

05:58:40.880 --> 05:58:42.880
Let's see

05:58:44.320 --> 05:58:46.320
Yeah, me

05:58:47.920 --> 05:58:53.440
I think I'm gonna raid Maeve. Yeah, she just hit 100k. I'm just playing Elden Ring

05:58:55.600 --> 05:58:58.000
Yeah, we'll we'll raid Maeve. That's cool

05:58:59.440 --> 05:59:01.440
from from, um

05:59:01.760 --> 05:59:03.760
Inyo, yeah

05:59:04.160 --> 05:59:06.160
Um

05:59:18.160 --> 05:59:21.680
Trying to make new friends out here we we make we build in bridges

05:59:22.720 --> 05:59:24.720
making connections

05:59:24.720 --> 05:59:31.120
Um, but you know, I care about you guys. Thank you for letting me be an honest little bunny today. Um, sorry about

05:59:32.080 --> 05:59:34.080
not streaming the game as much

05:59:34.640 --> 05:59:39.920
Um, but it was giving me a lot of issues. I was just on top of you guys. I'm sorry if that bothers you

05:59:40.720 --> 05:59:46.560
Um, tomorrow we'll be doing the uno collab. I am uh, I'm in there

05:59:46.720 --> 05:59:51.840
So we'll be having a lot of fun with the girls and very, very, very, very, very excited

05:59:52.400 --> 05:59:54.800
Just trying to join with them. Um

05:59:55.760 --> 05:59:57.760
I always love doing collabs with them

05:59:57.760 --> 05:59:59.760
Oh, yeah

06:00:12.800 --> 06:00:14.800
Okay, smell better today

06:00:27.760 --> 06:00:29.760
So
